00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is Jockel fondcast number 285 with echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.92
Jockel willing. Good evening, echo. Good evening. And also joining us tonight.

3
00:00:07.92 --> 00:00:16.08
Dave Burke, good evening, Dave. Good evening. All right. So we are going to dive into some work that I have been

4
00:00:16.08 --> 00:00:25.68
waiting to dive into it. I waited because I wanted to do it justice. I waited because I wanted to

5
00:00:25.68 --> 00:00:34.48
be thorough in covering it. I waited because there's a lot of work to cover. And going

6
00:00:35.44 --> 00:00:42.40
going into this, this particular book, books, series of books, articles, individual,

7
00:00:42.40 --> 00:00:48.80
the more I read over the years, it got better and better and kept getting better and kept making

8
00:00:48.80 --> 00:00:56.16
more sense to me from a tactical battle war perspective, from a leadership perspective,

9
00:00:58.24 --> 00:01:08.56
from a how-to lead perspective and also, contraryly like a red cell type, how not to lead,

10
00:01:10.40 --> 00:01:17.28
from a relationship leadership, capital perspective and a Jockel perspective. So basically,

11
00:01:17.28 --> 00:01:25.92
I was just seeing everything in my life wrapped up in this particular, this particular individual

12
00:01:25.92 --> 00:01:31.12
and his work. And on top of that, so that there's another podcast that I've got waiting in the

13
00:01:31.12 --> 00:01:35.60
wings or it's going to take a series of podcasts, but it's waiting in the wings. I'm super excited

14
00:01:35.60 --> 00:01:40.88
to do it, but I can't do that podcast until I do this podcast or at least this podcast or at least

15
00:01:40.88 --> 00:01:46.24
a couple of podcasts. On this individual, this one man, highly influential man, a guy named

16
00:01:46.24 --> 00:01:53.60
BH, Lidel, Hart, Basel, Henry, Lidel, Hart. You can probably guess if you don't know who he is.

17
00:01:53.60 --> 00:02:00.08
If you know military history and military strategy and military theory at all, you know who he is.

18
00:02:00.08 --> 00:02:04.48
If you don't know who he is, you can probably guess that he's British because he has the first name,

19
00:02:04.48 --> 00:02:10.96
Basel, right? Sure. I mean, that's a pretty British name. You didn't go to buy Basel. I guess he went

20
00:02:10.96 --> 00:02:18.40
by BH, I guess. I'm guessing that's how he writes his books. Mother's maiden name was Lidel.

21
00:02:19.68 --> 00:02:24.64
She was Scottish. You know, right, born and raised, I guess on the border of England.

22
00:02:24.64 --> 00:02:33.20
The heart side, the Lidel, the heart side was farmers. He was, he was, went to some really nice

23
00:02:33.92 --> 00:02:37.52
private schools, anything. So he grew up in England, born in France, but grew up in England.

24
00:02:37.52 --> 00:02:41.92
He went to some really nice private schools. The first one of the private schools that he went through

25
00:02:41.92 --> 00:02:46.80
is called St. Paul's, which is in London. And it was founded in 1509.

26
00:02:49.20 --> 00:02:55.84
High school, founded in 1509. Okay, so that's just kind of crazy when we think about England.

27
00:02:56.56 --> 00:03:01.84
Then he ended up at Cambridge University, which, by the way, was founded 300 years prior to that

28
00:03:01.84 --> 00:03:13.44
in 1209, 1209, 1209. Well, he left Cambridge University, one World War I broke out,

29
00:03:14.48 --> 00:03:18.88
volunteered for the British Army. He was in the King's own Yorkshire Light Infantry.

30
00:03:18.88 --> 00:03:24.40
Glad we did that light infantry podcast recently. Dave, you've timed it all. You like that one,

31
00:03:24.40 --> 00:03:28.08
didn't you? I did. Made you start thinking about some light infantry because it's a mindset.

32
00:03:28.08 --> 00:03:32.64
Yeah. It's not just a way that people are trained. It's a way of thinking.

33
00:03:33.28 --> 00:03:37.92
Yeah. And I got to pull that real time at Master. I listened to it all the way to Master and put it into

34
00:03:37.92 --> 00:03:43.76
my brief. What was that point that you made? Well, the whole point behind that, like the largest theory

35
00:03:43.76 --> 00:03:48.40
when you went into it was the size of the force is not the deciding factor. There's a lot of this,

36
00:03:48.40 --> 00:03:53.20
if you have a smaller force, doesn't guarantee your defeat. And the whole point of this was like,

37
00:03:53.20 --> 00:03:58.24
how are we going to move think maneuver in a way that a smaller force that looks weak on paper

38
00:03:58.24 --> 00:04:03.04
and just outmaneuver these big giant forces because they're inflexible, immobile, they're dug in.

39
00:04:03.04 --> 00:04:08.08
So that theoretically in my mind resonated with all sorts of stuff. Can you imagine as I was

40
00:04:08.08 --> 00:04:15.76
learning due to and thinking about that actual thing? How many how many how many elements

41
00:04:15.76 --> 00:04:21.76
started to just come into view? Like come out of the fog as I'm thinking through that very thing.

42
00:04:21.76 --> 00:04:27.76
I'm learning due to it's I'm like, oh, if I can maneuver myself over here and put all my force

43
00:04:27.76 --> 00:04:31.60
against a smaller portion of their strength, I can win.

44
00:04:33.76 --> 00:04:42.32
All right. So he goes into the British Army. He is part of the King's own Yorkshire light

45
00:04:42.32 --> 00:04:48.88
infantry shout out to Yorkshire. He spent time on the Western Front World War I.

46
00:04:48.88 --> 00:04:57.52
And got sent back from the front two times because he was blown up and had conclusive injuries.

47
00:04:58.88 --> 00:05:03.60
Cool. Hey, listen, you went to the front. You got blown up so bad that you got sent back,

48
00:05:03.60 --> 00:05:09.04
because you had conclusive injuries. Cool. You good. Okay. Go back. All right. You get blown up again.

49
00:05:09.04 --> 00:05:14.16
Boom. You know what? You're good. Okay. Go back again. Third time he goes back. Cool.

50
00:05:14.16 --> 00:05:20.56
Um, gets back just in time for the battle of the song. And during the battle of the song,

51
00:05:21.44 --> 00:05:28.88
wounded three times. Continue to fight. Finally, he gets gasped. Badly enough that he can't continue

52
00:05:28.88 --> 00:05:33.84
fighting. His battalion was just about wiped out on the first day of the offensive.

53
00:05:35.12 --> 00:05:41.36
Battle of the song. This is so his battalion was some of the 60,000 casualties on day one.

54
00:05:41.36 --> 00:05:51.84
And that event and those events clearly left a mark on his mentality. Because you've heard

55
00:05:51.84 --> 00:06:03.20
me go off and talk about the, I don't know if I've used the word stupidity before,

56
00:06:03.20 --> 00:06:09.84
because it's not the right word, but the, the, the problem with World War I of

57
00:06:09.84 --> 00:06:16.80
hey, okay. We just lost a battalion at 0,600. Cool. 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5. Dave. Your battalion's going.

58
00:06:16.80 --> 00:06:20.56
Okay. Dave's battalion just got wiped out. Okay. Echo at 6, 10. Your battalion. Go.

59
00:06:21.44 --> 00:06:27.76
And that's what we're doing. That left a mark on him. Eventually, after he's wounded,

60
00:06:27.76 --> 00:06:33.52
started to heal up, went back, trained new recruits, wrote the infantry training manual.

61
00:06:33.92 --> 00:06:37.52
After the war. After the war. After the war, hands up right in the infantry training manual.

62
00:06:37.52 --> 00:06:44.16
He got married. Got married to a woman named Jesse Stone. We're wondering what layers are there.

63
00:06:45.84 --> 00:06:53.60
Had a son, he retired in 1927. Came a journalist. Military historian, military theorist.

64
00:06:53.60 --> 00:07:07.44
wrote the most wrote so much. It's ridiculous. It's just writing all the time. Deep historical

65
00:07:07.44 --> 00:07:15.68
writing analysis, worked for Prime Minister Chamberlain. And he was kind of maneuvering and

66
00:07:15.68 --> 00:07:19.76
getting people to think in a different way of different way of using air power or different way of

67
00:07:19.76 --> 00:07:23.92
using tank power or different way of using maneuver warfare. And of course, we all know what happened

68
00:07:23.92 --> 00:07:31.12
with Prime Minister Chamberlain. He was weak and Churchill took over. And when Churchill took over,

69
00:07:31.12 --> 00:07:37.52
they kind of used the more traditional war strategy in the beginning. Guess who didn't do that.

70
00:07:38.32 --> 00:07:42.000
You know, who didn't do that Hitler, the Nazis, who were actually paying attention.

71
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:52.64
Now, there's some question around how much influence heart, Le Del Hart had over the Nazis.

72
00:07:52.64 --> 00:07:58.32
There's definitely some meaning. They were reading the line in Patton. I read your book.

73
00:07:58.32 --> 00:08:04.32
Right. So Patton saying he read Rommel's book. Well, there's there are actual connections

74
00:08:04.32 --> 00:08:11.60
between Rommel and some of the other more known, more well known and some of the lesser well-known

75
00:08:11.60 --> 00:08:15.60
Nazi leaders that were reading his stuff. I'm being like, I know this makes this makes sense.

76
00:08:16.48 --> 00:08:22.16
There's also a lot of people that will say that that be a child. Kind of inflated that a little bit.

77
00:08:23.92 --> 00:08:30.56
But there was some influence. And also regardless of how much of a connection there was,

78
00:08:30.56 --> 00:08:34.56
even if there wasn't a connection, they were both thinking the same things. Right. They were both

79
00:08:34.56 --> 00:08:39.28
taking and learning the same lessons, which that's what that happened sometimes. You know, you put

80
00:08:39.28 --> 00:08:43.28
somebody in one situation, they're in a vacuum from someone else. If you put them in a similar

81
00:08:43.28 --> 00:08:48.16
situation like World War I, there's a pretty good chance that they could come to similar conclusions.

82
00:08:48.16 --> 00:08:53.04
Like maybe it's not smart just to line up and start attacking all at once. Maybe we should use

83
00:08:53.04 --> 00:08:57.20
some decentralized command. Maybe we should use maneuver warfare. So they all kind of came to the same

84
00:08:57.20 --> 00:09:02.000
conclusions, meaning BHLadel Hart, meaning some of the German and Nazi leadership.

85
00:09:05.52 --> 00:09:10.24
And so that stuff kind of came into play. So he wrote a bunch of this stuff down.

86
00:09:13.84 --> 00:09:20.64
He wrote a book called The Strategy of the Indirect Approach, which was also printed

87
00:09:20.64 --> 00:09:25.60
as the way to win wars, which is pretty cool. And what this is kind of what kicked me into

88
00:09:25.60 --> 00:09:31.12
hyperdrive of doing this, and we talked about this on the underground. So I did a post about

89
00:09:32.56 --> 00:09:37.12
about the Civil War. I did a post a social media post about the Civil War, about the Battle

90
00:09:37.12 --> 00:09:42.000
of Chancellorville, about Jackson taking the indirect path going 14 miles around to the flank of the

91
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.52
Union troops and winning the battle in an hour as opposed to just taking the direct assault towards

92
00:09:47.52 --> 00:09:52.24
the Union troops, which is a half a mile. And some of the comments in there, you know,

93
00:09:52.24 --> 00:09:56.40
I'll, of course, what do I focus on? But most of the comments were like, yeah, that makes sense.

94
00:09:56.40 --> 00:10:01.36
Use the indirect approach. And I talked about using it towards people, and in a leadership position,

95
00:10:01.36 --> 00:10:07.12
how the indirect approach is normally the best way to go. And people were like, you know,

96
00:10:07.12 --> 00:10:10.64
you should just tell the truth. Like, are you saying you should lie to people? So it was that whole

97
00:10:10.64 --> 00:10:18.96
thing. And so I look, I know where I got these ideas from. It's no mystery to me. And part of it is the

98
00:10:18.96 --> 00:10:25.12
fact that you put me in and you put someone in an environment and you make them figure something out.

99
00:10:25.12 --> 00:10:28.72
They're going to come to the same conclusions. Right. So some of this stuff I was thinking,

100
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.28
man, going to the flank makes a lot of sense. And it makes a lot of sense from leadership.

101
00:10:33.28 --> 00:10:38.48
But, but I also know that these ideas were dripped into my head over the years. I mean, when you do

102
00:10:38.48 --> 00:10:46.000
a basic seal assault on a target, guess what? You set up a base element that puts down covering fire

103
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.52
and then a flanking element goes around, that's what you do. This is not rocket science. So I know

104
00:10:51.52 --> 00:10:57.36
that some of my indirect, my theory, my thoughts around the indirect strategy, the indirect approach.

105
00:10:57.36 --> 00:11:02.64
I know some of those were just from being in the military. But I also know that some of it came

106
00:11:02.64 --> 00:11:09.20
from reading heart. And so it made me crack open some of these books again and made me kind of fast

107
00:11:09.20 --> 00:11:21.44
forward in my mind to getting to these sooner in this podcast. Because let's face it. When

108
00:11:25.12 --> 00:11:29.52
well, the theories based in reality. Right. And that's what that's what's interesting about this.

109
00:11:29.52 --> 00:11:35.12
When you have someone that's spent time in the military, because the the the name of this book

110
00:11:35.12 --> 00:11:39.20
that one of the books we're going to look at today is the strategy of indirect approach. And it's

111
00:11:39.20 --> 00:11:47.76
about the theory, right? But if you have someone when you have someone that's been in war and spent

112
00:11:47.76 --> 00:11:53.12
time as a military leader and spent time in combat, and spent time in the worst kind of combat,

113
00:11:53.12 --> 00:12:00.40
like the actual worst combat. The actual worst combat, battle of salt, like the worst combat,

114
00:12:00.40 --> 00:12:07.36
actual worst combat, it doesn't, it's not theory anymore. Right. That theory becomes based deeply

115
00:12:07.36 --> 00:12:14.88
in reality. And that's what we have with with this book. And we're becoming covering two of his

116
00:12:14.88 --> 00:12:19.92
books today. Or at least trying to cover two of them. We might make it through, I don't even know

117
00:12:19.92 --> 00:12:24.40
how much because there's a lot to talk about. One is called the strategy of the indirect approach,

118
00:12:24.40 --> 00:12:28.32
which which I guess said was also reprinted as the way to win wars. And the other one is just

119
00:12:28.32 --> 00:12:39.92
called strategy straight up. So I guess we're going to get to it. Anything, Dave?

120
00:12:43.60 --> 00:12:48.48
I wrote down the word travesty. When you were talking about war one, I just wrote that word

121
00:12:48.48 --> 00:12:54.88
down just to remind me of the thing that I think about is you, when you talk about losing a battalion,

122
00:12:54.88 --> 00:12:58.56
it says scale, I think it's actually kind of hard to comprehend when to think of a battalion.

123
00:12:58.56 --> 00:13:03.44
I mean, I have, we have lost. I've been on patrols where we lost a vehicle. The lost people in

124
00:13:03.44 --> 00:13:09.52
a whole vehicle. A battalion is on a scale and just sort of the willingness to allow that to happen

125
00:13:10.40 --> 00:13:14.56
over and over again. And then then in retrospect thinking, and I was thinking of this as you said,

126
00:13:14.56 --> 00:13:19.12
it was the Germans had to learn that same lesson. They had to have learned the same lesson.

127
00:13:19.68 --> 00:13:23.28
You know, the Marine Corps takes a little bit of pride in sort of showing up, having the similar

128
00:13:23.28 --> 00:13:27.68
experience and then saying, we're not doing this anymore. And the Marine Corps really takes pride in

129
00:13:27.68 --> 00:13:32.48
that and we teach that history. But in actual world war one, yes, where you're talking about. Yes,

130
00:13:32.48 --> 00:13:37.12
in actual world war one of showing up sort of after the war had been underway for quite some time,

131
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.36
getting on board with how is how is being done and then suffering massive casualties in

132
00:13:43.36 --> 00:13:47.52
the very initially engagements and saying, we're done with this direct assault approach.

133
00:13:47.52 --> 00:13:53.44
And the larger point to that is the idea that not just for him, but for Germany as well,

134
00:13:53.44 --> 00:14:00.24
the idea that the way we did that was a travesty and that that you would see how those lessons

135
00:14:00.24 --> 00:14:04.88
apply to well beyond just warfare that that would sink into your psyche and every single

136
00:14:05.28 --> 00:14:12.72
everything you did in your life would be informed as such a bad way to describe like it's

137
00:14:12.72 --> 00:14:17.04
influence on a level that you wouldn't just rethink how you did war. You would rethink every

138
00:14:17.04 --> 00:14:21.68
aspect of your life. If you suffered the casualties to that degree because of the willingness

139
00:14:21.68 --> 00:14:25.20
for leaders to just say, just like you described, your battalions gone, you're up next.

140
00:14:26.24 --> 00:14:30.24
And the fact that it influenced every aspect of his life is actually not even remotely surprised

141
00:14:30.24 --> 00:14:36.80
to me. Yeah, and it boils down to, and I know you like when I say this Dave, it becomes not just a

142
00:14:36.80 --> 00:14:42.32
theory, not just a strategy, but a way of thinking, a way of thinking. Yes, what it becomes. And what's

143
00:14:42.32 --> 00:14:51.20
interesting is, we're about to hear exactly how that transpired in his head. And this is something

144
00:14:51.20 --> 00:14:54.88
we covered this and we could actually covered this on the underground. But I just, I had to touch

145
00:14:54.88 --> 00:15:01.28
on the underground, but we're going to go deep. So here we go. Here's the preface. My original

146
00:15:01.28 --> 00:15:07.28
strategy of the strategy of indirect approach was written in 1929, published under the title,

147
00:15:07.28 --> 00:15:12.48
the decisive wars of history. It has been out of print for some time. So there's another third

148
00:15:12.48 --> 00:15:17.12
title that this book has been published under. In the following year, in the years following

149
00:15:17.12 --> 00:15:22.80
its publication, I continued to explore this line of fall. And from the results of such further

150
00:15:22.80 --> 00:15:29.04
study compiled a number of supplementary notes, which were privately circulated. Since the course

151
00:15:29.04 --> 00:15:35.84
of the present war has provided further examples of the value of the indirect approach and thereby

152
00:15:35.84 --> 00:15:42.56
given fresh point to the thesis, the issue of a new edition of the book provides an opportunity

153
00:15:42.56 --> 00:15:49.52
to include these. So now he's writing this, he's putting this one out in World War II.

154
00:15:50.72 --> 00:15:54.16
And actually it's towards the end of World War II because well, he's he's

155
00:15:54.16 --> 00:16:02.40
ends up talking about World War II and what's happening. When in the course of studying a long

156
00:16:02.40 --> 00:16:09.20
series of military campaigns, I first came to perceive the superiority of the indirect over the

157
00:16:09.20 --> 00:16:15.36
direct approach. I was looking merely for light upon strategy. So he starts off just looking like,

158
00:16:15.36 --> 00:16:19.04
okay, how does this work? How can we win? Seems like this indirect thing's pretty cool.

159
00:16:20.24 --> 00:16:26.40
Seems like a good strategy for the battlefield. With deepening reflection, however,

160
00:16:26.40 --> 00:16:34.72
I began to realize that the indirect approach had a much wider application that it was a law

161
00:16:34.72 --> 00:16:47.20
of life in all spheres, a truth of philosophy. Right? A law of life in all spheres.

162
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.60
So this is where we get crazy because there's so many people. So many people, this is like,

163
00:16:55.60 --> 00:17:00.24
oh, you got to be direct. That's just such a common theme in the world. You got to be direct.

164
00:17:00.24 --> 00:17:08.88
You got to be frank. You got to tell. So I get it. I get it. I get it. He found that this has a

165
00:17:08.88 --> 00:17:16.32
much wider application. And it's a law of all, all of life in all spheres, a truth of philosophy.

166
00:17:16.32 --> 00:17:22.64
It's fulfillment was seen to be the key practical achievement in dealing with any problem

167
00:17:22.64 --> 00:17:29.52
where the human factor predominates and a conflict of wheels tends to spring from an

168
00:17:29.52 --> 00:17:37.68
underlying concern for interests. Okay. So here's where this gets awesome. So he's talking about

169
00:17:37.68 --> 00:17:43.68
conflict, right? A conflict of wheels. And what we might fail to realize is that if I'm on the

170
00:17:43.68 --> 00:17:52.08
same team as Dave, we can also still have a conflict of wheels because Dave wants to A and I want to

171
00:17:52.08 --> 00:17:58.48
do be. So even though we're on the same team, that's like one of the other perspectives that I think

172
00:17:58.48 --> 00:18:02.88
about this. You know what I said about leadership capital and relationships? That's this applies

173
00:18:02.88 --> 00:18:13.04
100% there, too. In all such cases, in all such cases. So this is cases where you have

174
00:18:13.04 --> 00:18:19.76
the human factor. Anytime you got the human factor, in all such cases, the direct assault of new

175
00:18:19.76 --> 00:18:26.64
ideas, provokes a stubborn resistance, thus intensifying the difficulty of producing a change of

176
00:18:26.64 --> 00:18:32.32
outlook. Dave, how long have you heard how many times have you heard me tell this to clients,

177
00:18:32.32 --> 00:18:41.20
to people? This is it. It's I don't have the vocabulary to explain how often we say that in

178
00:18:41.20 --> 00:18:46.96
some version of that sentence in everything. But I got to be careful because I could probably just

179
00:18:46.96 --> 00:18:53.04
just hearing it and invoke so many things that think about. But he's almost articulating it like

180
00:18:54.24 --> 00:19:00.32
when there's a human component to this and I'm thinking of myself. So when is that not, when in my

181
00:19:00.32 --> 00:19:05.12
life am I not interacting with another human being? If we're if we're doing a computer software

182
00:19:05.12 --> 00:19:10.16
design, right, we don't need to worry about this. Right. If we're actually programming a machine of

183
00:19:10.16 --> 00:19:16.16
some kind, we don't need to worry about it. Yeah. Other than that, other than that, if you directly

184
00:19:16.16 --> 00:19:21.44
assault an idea, it's going to provoke stubborn resistance. So if I impose my plan on Dave,

185
00:19:21.44 --> 00:19:25.84
it's going to get resistance. Even though Dave's on my team, I impose a plan on it's going to be

186
00:19:25.84 --> 00:19:34.24
resistant. And it's going to make the change of outlook harder. It's going to make the change of

187
00:19:34.24 --> 00:19:41.84
outlook harder. So if my wife wants something and I attack it, it's going to be harder for her to

188
00:19:41.84 --> 00:19:45.04
change her mind. There's going to be more resistance for her change, you can remind on where we're

189
00:19:45.04 --> 00:19:54.96
going out for dinner. That's what's going to happen. Back to the book, conversion is achieved

190
00:19:54.96 --> 00:20:04.24
more easily and rapidly by unsuspected infiltration of a different idea or by an argument that

191
00:20:04.24 --> 00:20:13.20
turns the flank of instinctive opposition. So you're going to get more easy, more easily and more

192
00:20:13.20 --> 00:20:24.72
rapidly conversion of their brain will come when you flank them. Check and faster and faster rapidly

193
00:20:24.72 --> 00:20:31.04
and more easily by an unsuspected infiltration of a different idea and by the way, don't let

194
00:20:31.04 --> 00:20:34.80
well we'll get to it. So there's some people that are thinking right now, oh, so what you're going to

195
00:20:34.80 --> 00:20:40.16
use going to lie to Dave? No, I'm not going to lie to Dave. Doesn't mean I didn't mean I say,

196
00:20:40.16 --> 00:20:43.68
well, actually, Dave, we should use my plan because Adam and I'm going to make up some intel that

197
00:20:43.68 --> 00:20:47.92
sports my plan. I'm going to make up a timeline that sports my plan. No, that's not what I'm talking

198
00:20:47.92 --> 00:20:56.000
about at all. Back to the book, in commerce, the suggestion that there is a bargain to be secured as far

199
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.48
more potent than any direct appeal to buy. And in any sphere, it is a proverbial

200
00:21:02.48 --> 00:21:10.64
that the surest way of gaining a superior acceptance of a new idea is to persuade them that it is

201
00:21:10.64 --> 00:21:20.80
his idea. Hello, this is something again. Maybe I should just start paying what is it? Paying

202
00:21:21.36 --> 00:21:25.76
royalties. I just own royalties to be it because leadership strategy and tackle, oh, that's just

203
00:21:25.76 --> 00:21:32.32
all in there. Let us make it their idea. As in war, the aim is to weaken resistance,

204
00:21:32.32 --> 00:21:38.000
before attempting to overcome it. And the effect is best attained by drawing the other party

205
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.76
out of his defenses. Great. We're not attacking hardened positions. This idea of the indirect

206
00:21:45.76 --> 00:21:56.64
approaches closely related to all problems of the influence of mind upon mind. All problems of

207
00:21:56.64 --> 00:22:02.40
the influence of mind upon mind. All problems. Any time it's my mind against someone else's mind,

208
00:22:02.40 --> 00:22:08.08
this is where we need to go and direct. The most influential factor in human history.

209
00:22:10.24 --> 00:22:17.12
Yet it is harder reconcile with another lesson that true conclusions can only be reached or

210
00:22:17.12 --> 00:22:22.32
approached by pursuing the truth without regard to where it may lead or what its effect may be

211
00:22:22.32 --> 00:22:27.68
on different interests. So what do we say in there? And how are we saying? Wait a second. Wait a second.

212
00:22:27.68 --> 00:22:33.28
What shouldn't we be going after the truth? Like, isn't it the, look, if I'm working with Dave

213
00:22:33.92 --> 00:22:39.20
and I think my plan is better, well then I need to tell him that. That's the truth. The truth is my

214
00:22:39.20 --> 00:22:44.48
plan is better. And what's so hard about this is one of those universal things that pisses me off.

215
00:22:44.48 --> 00:23:01.60
I got you. There's no one that it's against all moly high ground to lie. Right? So the opposite

216
00:23:01.60 --> 00:23:08.32
of lying is what? Truth. Telling the truth. So if we're certain to think that this is not telling

217
00:23:08.32 --> 00:23:14.96
the truth and what do we do it? We must be lying. So how do we reconcile? That's what we say.

218
00:23:14.96 --> 00:23:19.60
How do we reconcile this? Wait, I have a different plan than Dave. I think my plan is better.

219
00:23:19.60 --> 00:23:25.20
I should tell him the truth. That's what I should do. I shouldn't lie to him. We're not talking

220
00:23:25.20 --> 00:23:30.64
all lying to him. Back to the book. History bears witness to the vital part

221
00:23:31.68 --> 00:23:38.08
that the prophets have played in human progress, which is evidence of the ultimate practical

222
00:23:38.08 --> 00:23:44.08
value of expressing unreservedly the truth is one sees it. Okay. So now we're going to get

223
00:23:44.08 --> 00:23:48.48
he's going to use the example, historical examples and there's countless of

224
00:23:50.32 --> 00:23:56.40
prophets. Someone that is a prophet that stands up and says this is the truth as I see it.

225
00:23:57.60 --> 00:24:05.60
And tells the truth. Yet it also becomes clear that the acceptance and spreading of their

226
00:24:05.60 --> 00:24:11.60
vision has always depended on another class of men. What's the other class of men? Leaders.

227
00:24:13.60 --> 00:24:22.72
Leaders who had to be philosophical strategists striking a compromise between truth and men's

228
00:24:22.72 --> 00:24:29.60
receptivity to it. So lately I've been saying a lot of what good is telling the truth if no one

229
00:24:29.60 --> 00:24:35.36
hears it or no one listens to you. If you stab somebody in the eye with the dagger of truth,

230
00:24:35.36 --> 00:24:39.20
what are they going to do? They're going to be pissed. They're going to lash out at you. They might

231
00:24:39.20 --> 00:24:44.80
even pull out a side arm and shoot you in the gut. But they definitely don't want to hear anything from

232
00:24:44.80 --> 00:24:50.48
it. And they'll do their best to pull that thing back out and stab you with it. So even made any progress

233
00:24:50.48 --> 00:24:56.40
at all. So that's what a prophet does. A prophet says this is the truth and they stab you in the eye with it.

234
00:24:56.40 --> 00:25:03.52
A leader has to find that compromise between telling the truth and getting people to actually listen to it.

235
00:25:07.68 --> 00:25:12.80
Their effect has often depended as much on their own limitations in perceiving the truth as on their

236
00:25:12.80 --> 00:25:17.92
practical wisdom in proclaiming it. So how are you going to tell the truth? Practical wisdom. How are

237
00:25:17.92 --> 00:25:22.32
you going to say? How are you going to say it? Where it'll actually be listened to?

238
00:25:22.32 --> 00:25:32.64
And then he goes on to say this, the prophets must be stoned. That is their lot. That is their

239
00:25:32.64 --> 00:25:36.96
test of their self fulfillment. What happens to the prophet? The prophet gets stoned. The prophet gets

240
00:25:36.96 --> 00:25:47.28
crucified. That's what happens. But a leader who is stoned may merely prove that he has failed in

241
00:25:47.28 --> 00:25:53.44
his function through a deficiency of wisdom or through confusing his function with that of a prophet.

242
00:25:54.08 --> 00:26:00.48
This is pure brilliance, by the way. This is absolute pure brilliance. So if you're that, if you're

243
00:26:00.48 --> 00:26:06.24
an leadership position and what you do is you start stabbing people with the dagger of truth in the neck

244
00:26:07.60 --> 00:26:11.68
and you think you're doing a good thing. Guess what? They're going to tackle you and they're

245
00:26:11.68 --> 00:26:14.80
going to stone you to death. They're going to execute you because you were stabbing people and

246
00:26:14.80 --> 00:26:20.64
it offended them and it hurt them and that you didn't convince anybody of anything. So sometimes

247
00:26:20.64 --> 00:26:24.64
you get a leader that's like, look, the truth is, listen, they're going to tell you the truth here.

248
00:26:24.64 --> 00:26:34.56
That's not good. It's not going to help you. It's crazy. You're like on page one. I know.

249
00:26:34.56 --> 00:26:44.88
I'll page one half. Yeah. I think the phrase that's been coming to mind a lot lately when you

250
00:26:44.88 --> 00:26:51.44
talk about this is a truth that it's imposed upon somebody compared to the truth that they

251
00:26:51.44 --> 00:26:57.84
discovered for themselves, the difference between those two. And I'm thinking of all the phrases

252
00:26:57.84 --> 00:27:03.52
that people use when they're going to reveal the truth. Let me stop you right there. Actually,

253
00:27:03.52 --> 00:27:10.000
like when you hear people prepping for the the direct assault, which is, I'm now going to let you know

254
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.12
and even the preparation for that, just that phrase alone puts the other person in a position where

255
00:27:15.12 --> 00:27:20.72
all they want to do is defend themselves. And the words that come next, almost don't even matter because

256
00:27:20.72 --> 00:27:28.96
if I say, actually, Jaco, the reality is. The reality is. The first thing you do is is you mentally

257
00:27:28.96 --> 00:27:34.48
you are dug in. No matter how truthful I'm going to be after that, it's just the connection that

258
00:27:34.48 --> 00:27:41.28
he's making though, like the how universal that is to all interactions is just it's it's

259
00:27:41.28 --> 00:27:47.44
crazy listening to this and then the the application to every interaction you have. With every

260
00:27:47.44 --> 00:27:55.68
with if any human being and how instinctive it is to, I guess, tell the truth and how ineffective

261
00:27:55.68 --> 00:27:59.44
that way of thinking is if there's an outcome that you're trying to shape.

262
00:28:01.60 --> 00:28:07.60
Eko Charles, every ever seen the movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yes, sir. Okay. So there's

263
00:28:07.60 --> 00:28:14.32
an arc, right? Our feet arc of the covenant. And I think the truth is kind of like that.

264
00:28:15.44 --> 00:28:22.56
If you reveal that truth in an improper way, people's faces are not enough. That's what happens.

265
00:28:22.56 --> 00:28:31.20
Yeah. So people treat the truth as if it's only benevolent as if it can only do good.

266
00:28:31.92 --> 00:28:35.52
But you gotta remember there's collateral that truth causes collateral damage and people don't

267
00:28:35.52 --> 00:28:40.16
pay attention to that. So when you start pulling off the lid, maybe you got to like,

268
00:28:40.16 --> 00:28:44.32
you got to prep people for it. You got to say, turn your eyes for a second here. There's going to be

269
00:28:44.32 --> 00:28:49.76
some bright lights. If you don't prep them for it and what what we want to do,

270
00:28:49.76 --> 00:28:56.88
what we want to do is we want them to reveal the truth themselves. That's what we really want.

271
00:28:57.60 --> 00:29:00.96
A really good leader. Look, a profit will show you the truth. Maybe you're getting melted.

272
00:29:01.60 --> 00:29:07.44
A really good leader. You somehow discover the truth. That means they showed it to you. But you're

273
00:29:07.44 --> 00:29:13.68
even out. So the whole expression, the truth hurts. You know that, that's because that's kind of

274
00:29:13.68 --> 00:29:20.32
common right? Truth. So would that be an indicator of maybe a profit or not the correct rate?

275
00:29:20.32 --> 00:29:24.08
That's profit all day long. Profit is like, look, look, I go, true, third, but I'm going to tell you

276
00:29:24.08 --> 00:29:29.92
something. You know what I mean? How how how how how open-minded are you when I get done with that statement?

277
00:29:30.64 --> 00:29:36.16
I would meet it with stubborn resistance check. And you know, we like to think that, you know,

278
00:29:36.16 --> 00:29:40.32
I really have a good relationship with someone. You know, great. There might be one person in your

279
00:29:40.32 --> 00:29:45.20
entire life that you can be like, hey, dude, that was jacked up and you're like, cool, got it.

280
00:29:45.20 --> 00:29:48.40
What adjustments to write it? There's one person in your life you can do that with.

281
00:29:48.40 --> 00:29:53.04
Yeah, it is maybe. Isn't that at the end of the day in a way the indirect approach anyway?

282
00:29:53.04 --> 00:29:56.88
Because you know, you say, okay, that one person. Yeah, but you know, why is that one person? Because you

283
00:29:56.88 --> 00:30:01.28
have this years and years and years and years and years of this indirect, you know, kind of approach or

284
00:30:01.28 --> 00:30:05.68
whatever end of the year. So you open up that little hole that, yeah, you have that direct line all day.

285
00:30:05.68 --> 00:30:10.72
Now, yeah, now he's at, yes, you are correct, even that approach. Because if you were to met that

286
00:30:10.72 --> 00:30:14.72
person day one three years ago and said, you know, I was looking at the video you made,

287
00:30:15.28 --> 00:30:19.68
I'm not feeling it. Actually, you know, the camera angles that you use kind of marginal, right?

288
00:30:21.28 --> 00:30:24.96
So these are five years of work in with you before I could be like, bra.

289
00:30:25.84 --> 00:30:29.68
The soundtrack. No, actually. You put a Christmas song in there. It was actually right away.

290
00:30:29.68 --> 00:30:38.40
Yeah. You're right. Back to the book. Time alone can tell whether the effect of such a

291
00:30:38.40 --> 00:30:43.84
sacrifice redeems the apparent failure as a leader that does honor to him as a man. So there's a

292
00:30:43.84 --> 00:30:47.44
chance that you could, you could present something in over time. People go, yeah, he was right.

293
00:30:49.04 --> 00:30:56.40
At the least, he avoids the more common fault of leader of leaders. That of sacrificing the truth

294
00:30:56.40 --> 00:31:04.000
to expediency without ultimate advantage to the cause. So occasionally a leader is like, you know what,

295
00:31:04.40 --> 00:31:08.40
we just need to tell the truth and you sacrifice it. It gets killed. It gets thrown away. And

296
00:31:08.40 --> 00:31:13.20
one of the books that I'm, or the podcast that I want to move to from this one, which I will get

297
00:31:13.20 --> 00:31:18.88
to and I'm not 100% sure when, but they got all these examples of problems in the military and

298
00:31:18.88 --> 00:31:24.88
military thinking. And one of the problems, and I forget the exact number, but there has been like

299
00:31:24.88 --> 00:31:33.28
20 major advancements in naval warfare in the last 500 years. And every one of them was met with

300
00:31:33.28 --> 00:31:39.60
absolutely stiff resistance. No, not everyone in 17 of them were met with stiff resistance by all

301
00:31:39.60 --> 00:31:48.40
senior naval leaders in the world. You know, they started making ships from steel instead of

302
00:31:48.40 --> 00:31:51.68
what? And watch what like this is, Rio, you can't repair steel. We can need a well-drawn

303
00:31:51.68 --> 00:31:58.24
topic. They resisted, switching to the steam engine, switching to gas, which I reduce all, switching to

304
00:31:58.24 --> 00:32:03.44
like all the, every people resisted every one of these things, every one of them. Well, sorry,

305
00:32:03.44 --> 00:32:12.88
17 out of 20 of great advancements. It happens all the time. Because somebody goes hard with the truth

306
00:32:12.88 --> 00:32:19.68
and people defend. They go in instant defense mode. So like, remember the movie are independent.

307
00:32:19.68 --> 00:32:24.88
No, no, Army getting. I don't think I ever actually saw it, but. It's too bad. It's good flick.

308
00:32:24.88 --> 00:32:31.28
Oh sure. I wasn't that up for several Oscars. Anyway, Armageddon, Bruce Willis.

309
00:32:31.28 --> 00:32:36.80
Oh, yeah. Asteroid coming in, right? What was the plan that won? Do you want to

310
00:32:36.80 --> 00:32:42.96
arm again? I did. Sorry, dude. Yeah. In dependency, I was, I was down in the middle of

311
00:32:42.96 --> 00:32:47.92
that. We're just culturally lost. It's okay. I'll explain to you. Asteroid coming in,

312
00:32:47.92 --> 00:32:55.28
right? World world ending asteroid global killer. So they're like, hey, let's just throw a blast it with

313
00:32:55.28 --> 00:33:00.16
nukes and blow it right out of the sky. Then the smart scientists is like, that's a bad idea.

314
00:33:00.16 --> 00:33:04.32
Everyone gets all mad, right? No, actually, we're going to you know, direct approach.

315
00:33:04.32 --> 00:33:09.68
Lunch nukes, right? Can't get anymore directed that. But the smart scientists said, nope,

316
00:33:09.68 --> 00:33:12.48
this is what you're going to do. You're going to go in there. You're going to drill a little hole.

317
00:33:12.48 --> 00:33:17.52
You're going to put a nuk in that hole. You're going to just nudge it just a little bit on the side.

318
00:33:17.52 --> 00:33:23.68
It's now that trajectory gets changed. Do you see what I'm saying? That was the smarter approach.

319
00:33:23.68 --> 00:33:28.40
Same thing, exactly right. Here I am going through historical books trying to figure this stuff out.

320
00:33:28.40 --> 00:33:32.72
I could figure it out with Armageddon. I get it on the Bruce Willis. Yeah, you don't go to

321
00:33:32.72 --> 00:33:40.24
bother with all this. Check. Back to the book. We good. Yes, Armageddon. Yeah. I'm just saying these

322
00:33:40.24 --> 00:33:47.28
ideas everywhere. You see them say we go bad. No. For whoever, habitually suppresses the truth.

323
00:33:47.28 --> 00:33:52.48
So this is where this is where you have to pay attention. Because again, it's not me lying to

324
00:33:52.48 --> 00:33:57.36
Dave and saying, well, actually, Dave, the timeline that's required for the plan, you, but we better use

325
00:33:57.36 --> 00:34:05.76
my plan. Whoever, habitually suppresses the truth in the interest of tact will produce a deformity

326
00:34:05.76 --> 00:34:13.52
from the womb of his thought. So you can't, you can't lie about what you're saying. You have to

327
00:34:13.52 --> 00:34:19.84
maintain, you have to maintain the truth, but you have to take an indirect approach. That's it.

328
00:34:20.40 --> 00:34:28.56
It's not a lie. It's an indirect approach bound to the truth. He explains it a little bit more.

329
00:34:28.56 --> 00:34:36.08
Is there a practical way of combining progress towards the attainment of truth with progress

330
00:34:36.08 --> 00:34:43.12
towards its acceptance? Is there a way to get Dave to think about my plan and utilize my plan

331
00:34:45.28 --> 00:34:52.40
with also doing it in a way that he is open to accept this idea? Is there a combination of those two

332
00:34:52.40 --> 00:34:57.92
things of telling Dave the truth about what I think of his plan? And at the same time, getting him to

333
00:34:57.92 --> 00:35:05.52
accept my opinion, that's what we want, right? A possible solution of the problem is suggested by

334
00:35:05.52 --> 00:35:11.76
reflection on strategic principles, which point to the importance of maintaining an object

335
00:35:11.76 --> 00:35:20.96
consistently and also of pursuing it in a way adapted to the circumstances. This seems so obvious

336
00:35:22.08 --> 00:35:27.36
is that we continue to focus on the right thing, but then we continue to move towards this objective

337
00:35:27.36 --> 00:35:32.72
but as circumstances change, we adjust, we maneuver. We say, oh yeah, there's a massive enemy

338
00:35:33.60 --> 00:35:36.72
location right here. Let's not continue in that direction. Let's go around it.

339
00:35:38.24 --> 00:35:42.96
Isn't it smart to do that with our ideas as well? It doesn't mean we abandon the objective.

340
00:35:42.96 --> 00:35:47.60
It doesn't mean we say, oh, we're going to change this objective or we're not going to continue

341
00:35:47.60 --> 00:35:54.40
to, it means we adjust our approach and maybe instead of going direct, we go indirect.

342
00:35:54.40 --> 00:36:03.68
Opposition to the truth is inevitable. That's a good thing to remember.

343
00:36:04.88 --> 00:36:09.44
Opposition to the truth is inevitable, especially if it takes the form of a new idea,

344
00:36:09.44 --> 00:36:15.68
but the degree of resistance can be diminished by giving thought not only to the aim but to the

345
00:36:15.68 --> 00:36:23.68
method of approach. Avoid a frontal attack in a long established position. Instead, seek to turn it

346
00:36:23.68 --> 00:36:29.84
by a flank movement so that the more penetrable side is exposed to the thrust of the truth.

347
00:36:33.12 --> 00:36:40.000
But in any such indirect approach, take care not to diverge from the truth. For nothing is more

348
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.72
fatal to its real advancement than to lapse into the untruth.

349
00:36:47.28 --> 00:36:52.16
So for the people that commented when I talked about the indirect approach and we're like, oh,

350
00:36:52.16 --> 00:36:56.72
you're just going to lie to your people. No, no, we're not going to lie to our people.

351
00:36:56.72 --> 00:37:02.72
The truth is the objective, but we are going to adjust our approach so that we're not offensive

352
00:37:02.72 --> 00:37:08.16
to the individuals or the groups that we're talking to so that we don't cause them to put up a

353
00:37:08.16 --> 00:37:15.44
more stiff resistance to fight against our idea, to, to, for them to look at it as if it's not the truth.

354
00:37:15.44 --> 00:37:25.28
We're going to get a flank. That's what we're going to do. And then he goes on here and he says

355
00:37:25.28 --> 00:37:31.52
the meaning of these reflections may be made clearer by illustration from one's own experience.

356
00:37:32.80 --> 00:37:40.32
Looking back on the stages by which various fresh ideas gained acceptance, it can be seen

357
00:37:40.32 --> 00:37:45.52
that the process was eased when they could be presented, not as something radically new, but as

358
00:37:45.52 --> 00:37:50.24
the revival in modern terms of a time-honored principle or practice that had been forgotten. So here's

359
00:37:50.24 --> 00:38:00.72
is one of his little indirect approaches is to take a new idea and and camouflage it with an old idea.

360
00:38:00.72 --> 00:38:05.60
It's kind of like what the, what the Christians did with the Vikings. Right, Easter, you know,

361
00:38:05.60 --> 00:38:15.28
the term Easter and yes, it's a pagan thing, but we call it this a pagan word and it's a pagan ceremony.

362
00:38:16.56 --> 00:38:21.20
But the Christians were like, oh yeah, you can call the thing in the spring. We call that Easter. It's cool.

363
00:38:21.92 --> 00:38:27.76
It's about Christ rising, but we call it Easter. It's sort of a thing that you guys already do.

364
00:38:27.76 --> 00:38:31.44
They just kind of taken all the idea and rebrand it. That's actually what they did.

365
00:38:31.44 --> 00:38:37.04
Yeah, I think they did that with Christmas too. That was Christmas too. So that's what we're doing.

366
00:38:37.04 --> 00:38:42.80
We're kind of camouflaging this idea. So it's a little more open to it. Yeah, you know how you guys do the spring time thing

367
00:38:42.80 --> 00:38:49.12
and you guys celebrate birth, right? We had, you know, like a rebirth kind of co-brand that thing. We're good.

368
00:38:50.88 --> 00:38:53.12
It's kind of like your dog. Great. We can feed them the heart pills.

369
00:38:53.84 --> 00:38:58.96
Right, heart worm pills. Okay. You put it in a little, put a little piece of steak around that.

370
00:38:58.96 --> 00:39:04.88
Yeah, you know, like you've been eating this food this whole time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, just put the, put the heart worm pills in there.

371
00:39:07.36 --> 00:39:13.52
He goes, he goes on to say, here, this required not deception, but care to trace the connection. Since there is nothing new in this one.

372
00:39:13.52 --> 00:39:16.88
Right, you can always figure out something that ties into what you're doing.

373
00:39:18.24 --> 00:39:24.24
A notable example was the way that the opposition to mechanized mechanization was diminished by showing that the mobile

374
00:39:24.24 --> 00:39:31.52
armored vehicle, the fast moving tank was fundamentally the air of the armored horsemen and thus the natural means of

375
00:39:31.52 --> 00:39:34.000
reviving the decisive role, which cavalry

376
00:39:34.80 --> 00:39:41.12
played in past ages, which is what we call what do we call armored cavalry now? Why is that because people

377
00:39:41.12 --> 00:39:46.000
resist this tank? It's going to get stuck. It takes gas. I mean, the horse can go forever. You can eat off the land.

378
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.40
How are you going to refuel these tanks? People just resisted that idea. Is this? And then it's like, oh no, no, this is the new

379
00:39:50.40 --> 00:39:57.12
cavalry. Okay, kind of cool. Then we're down. So what can you do is you try and convince people of ideas

380
00:39:58.40 --> 00:40:05.20
taking all my idea, repackage it. And it's true because there's no idea new ideas under the sun. It's not like you're lying to them.

381
00:40:10.56 --> 00:40:16.32
I don't know. Obviously, what's coming in terms of, you know, that how much detail is in and

382
00:40:16.32 --> 00:40:24.40
warling discuss, but even just even just the word the truth, how that's the, it's the topic that you're

383
00:40:24.40 --> 00:40:34.40
trying to get across. Yes. And even what that means, like, if I have an idea, that's different than

384
00:40:34.40 --> 00:40:39.68
me like trying to get you to understand some sort of like, hey, two plus two is four. And you're going to say no.

385
00:40:39.68 --> 00:40:47.76
Okay, as opposed to I think we should do this and the abandonment of that truth versus, all right, listen, I can't

386
00:40:47.76 --> 00:40:52.40
just walk up to Jack and go, hey, this is the new way we're going to do, it's all this problem.

387
00:40:53.20 --> 00:40:58.88
And even just the word truth has a connotation like I'm right in your wrong, as opposed to,

388
00:40:58.88 --> 00:41:03.60
hey, I'm trying to get you to see this a different way. And it might not end up exactly how I've

389
00:41:03.60 --> 00:41:09.68
drawn it out. Maybe my drawing is like ends up in 80% or whatever, but I could see people getting

390
00:41:09.68 --> 00:41:14.24
hung up the idea that I have to convince Jack of the truth, meaning I know the answer.

391
00:41:14.24 --> 00:41:18.000
He doesn't. And if he doesn't, then I've got to figure out how to, and maybe the fast way

392
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.72
to just shove it in his face to go dude, this is what we're doing. As opposed to getting him to

393
00:41:22.72 --> 00:41:27.84
see that there might be another way of doing it, which is actually the truth, as opposed to,

394
00:41:27.84 --> 00:41:31.52
it has to be exactly my way. And if there's a mind field between you and me,

395
00:41:31.52 --> 00:41:38.24
I guess I could go into that mind field, but it's not going to help me get you to see something

396
00:41:38.24 --> 00:41:42.80
different. And he, I think, said the quote is, resistance to the truth is inevitable.

397
00:41:42.80 --> 00:41:48.56
Yeah, resistance to your ideas are inevitable. Yeah. So let's not, let's not pretend like you

398
00:41:48.56 --> 00:41:54.48
might be able to avoid that resistance, that mind field, that barrier, that wall, it is there.

399
00:41:56.08 --> 00:42:01.20
I just think the idea of the truth of us committing to, it is this way as opposed to, I want to

400
00:42:01.20 --> 00:42:06.72
think of something a different way. Yeah. No, that's a great point because what we're really,

401
00:42:06.72 --> 00:42:13.68
well, when we start talking about an in a leadership capacity, it becomes, hey, it's my idea.

402
00:42:14.72 --> 00:42:20.48
And as we were talking on EF online today, it's like, my assumption is that my idea is flawed.

403
00:42:21.04 --> 00:42:28.72
And I can present my idea to you, but I still presented as if not it's the truth, but it's an

404
00:42:28.72 --> 00:42:34.88
idea of a possibility. Now, what's interesting is what does that do to my idea? It makes it

405
00:42:34.88 --> 00:42:41.76
indirect totally. It makes it indirect. Me packaging the idea that I have as a possibility or as

406
00:42:41.76 --> 00:42:47.20
a thought or an idea for me, as opposed to this is the way we should do it. It makes it in

407
00:42:47.20 --> 00:42:56.88
indirect approach. And what we talked about today on EF online, I actually believe that. So I don't

408
00:42:56.88 --> 00:43:00.80
have to act. I don't have to pretend like, hey, I'm going to pretend like this isn't the best

409
00:43:00.80 --> 00:43:05.52
idea ever. And like Dave should just shut up and do it my way. I'm going to pretend that. So that

410
00:43:05.52 --> 00:43:09.68
way, it's a little more indirect. No, I actually think, this is my idea seems like a good idea, but

411
00:43:09.68 --> 00:43:14.72
there could be some holes punten to which is fine. I'm okay with that. So yeah, when we start

412
00:43:14.72 --> 00:43:21.12
talking about getting people's ideas and any time you, I mean, there's very few things that I

413
00:43:21.12 --> 00:43:28.88
actually hear something I've said early podcast is the amount of times that I say, Dave

414
00:43:29.52 --> 00:43:39.84
brought, listen, this is what we should do. The only reason I'm going to say that is if I am a 100%

415
00:43:41.84 --> 00:43:47.76
100% convicted that I, and it, it, you probably have never even heard me say that

416
00:43:47.76 --> 00:43:53.92
because it's so rare. Now, look, there was times where in this EF team somebody wanted to do something

417
00:43:53.92 --> 00:44:00.16
that was bad. Oh, you want to, you want to set up on two sides of a road and ambush someone in the

418
00:44:00.16 --> 00:44:04.72
middle. Okay, so that means we're going to be shooting at each other. Like, this is bad. We do not want

419
00:44:04.72 --> 00:44:10.80
to do that. Of course, how often did guys present to plans to me like that? Almost never. So most

420
00:44:10.80 --> 00:44:17.52
of the time it was, you know, hey, think through that, but very rarely, very rarely do I have the

421
00:44:17.52 --> 00:44:24.80
approach that I actually know the capital T true. Right. So this is a very good point to make.

422
00:44:25.92 --> 00:44:31.76
You, you, whoever you aren't, you don't know the truth. Very seldom are you 100% convinced.

423
00:44:31.76 --> 00:44:37.44
Hey, my idea is the truth. Don't walk around with that attitude. It's not good.

424
00:44:40.72 --> 00:44:46.48
All right, we're getting into this next section here, which is called history as practical

425
00:44:46.48 --> 00:44:53.04
experience starts off by saying, fool, say that they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by

426
00:44:53.04 --> 00:44:58.64
others experience this famous saying quoted by Bismarck, but by no means original to him has

427
00:44:58.64 --> 00:45:03.60
peculiar bearing on military questions for this often been remarked that the soldier, unlike

428
00:45:03.60 --> 00:45:09.28
followers of other person professions, has but rare opportunities to practice his profession.

429
00:45:09.28 --> 00:45:13.44
Isn't that interesting? Look, you're in the military cool. You're a professional soldier.

430
00:45:13.44 --> 00:45:20.32
Awesome. How often do you actually get to do that job? The answer is not as often as a normal,

431
00:45:20.32 --> 00:45:25.28
not as often as a carpenter, not as often as a plumber, not as often as a software engineer.

432
00:45:26.08 --> 00:45:31.04
You might get to train for it. You might, but how often are you locked and loaded and

433
00:45:31.04 --> 00:45:38.56
in combat with someone else in the military? Back to the book. Indeed, it might even be argued that

434
00:45:38.56 --> 00:45:42.96
in a literal sense, the profession of arms is not a profession at all, but merely he casual

435
00:45:42.96 --> 00:45:48.08
employment. And paradoxically, that it's cease to be a profession when the soldier of fortune

436
00:45:48.08 --> 00:45:52.32
gave way to the professional soldier. When mercenary troops were employed and paid for the purpose of

437
00:45:52.32 --> 00:45:56.80
war, were replaced by standing armies which continued to be paid when there was no war.

438
00:45:56.80 --> 00:45:59.12
So if you're a mercenary, you'd be like, oh, there's a war over there, cool. I'm going to go do

439
00:45:59.12 --> 00:46:02.08
that. That's kind of like a plumber. Oh, there's a different war over here, cool. I'm going to go to that one.

440
00:46:02.08 --> 00:46:06.08
Oh, there's a different war over here, cool. That's a little bit more of an actual profession.

441
00:46:06.08 --> 00:46:10.32
You might end up in more combat in your life than if you're in a standing army. That's doing

442
00:46:10.32 --> 00:46:16.24
that job even when there's no war going on. This logical if somewhat extreme argument recalls

443
00:46:16.24 --> 00:46:21.68
the excuse often made in the past for paying officers a rate inadequate to live on and by some of

444
00:46:21.68 --> 00:46:27.28
those officers for doing an inadequate today's work, the contention being that the officers pay

445
00:46:27.28 --> 00:46:33.84
was not a working salary but a retainer paid to him for the benefit of having his services available

446
00:46:33.84 --> 00:46:41.76
in case of war. This reminds me of some of the information about the British army and how just

447
00:46:41.76 --> 00:46:51.76
the officers during certain phases were just actual aristocrats that had almost no interest in fighting

448
00:46:51.76 --> 00:47:02.64
wars and almost complete interest in going to the country club. Some of the, some of the

449
00:47:02.64 --> 00:47:11.20
biographies of some of the guys that led the Boor war were pretty embarrassing and then they showed

450
00:47:11.20 --> 00:47:20.40
up for the Boor war with pianos and just I think it's not crazy. If the argument that strictly

451
00:47:20.40 --> 00:47:26.88
there is no professional arms will not hold good in most armies today on the score of work,

452
00:47:26.88 --> 00:47:32.88
it is inevitably strengthened on a score of practice by the increasing for infrequency of wars.

453
00:47:32.88 --> 00:47:36.96
So there's less and less wars now. Are we then left with the conclusion that armies are doomed

454
00:47:36.96 --> 00:47:43.20
to become more and more amateurish in the popular bad sense of that much abused and misused word?

455
00:47:43.20 --> 00:47:46.32
So hey look, if you're in the military, you're not getting to fight all the time. Does that mean you

456
00:47:46.32 --> 00:47:52.24
become an amateur over time? For obviously even the best of peace training is more theoretical than

457
00:47:52.24 --> 00:47:55.76
practical and experience and you know what I like? Well the reason I wasn't going to do this section

458
00:47:55.76 --> 00:48:01.12
but guess what? It's the same thing with leadership. It's the same thing with leadership. You're

459
00:48:01.12 --> 00:48:06.72
in a leadership position. How often are you actually in a challenging situation? In leadership?

460
00:48:06.72 --> 00:48:11.84
How often do someone say hey boss, I'm not doing this. How often do someone say that I'm not

461
00:48:11.84 --> 00:48:17.60
working with that person like you you end up with combative situations but how often is that?

462
00:48:17.60 --> 00:48:21.92
Because normally people are hey yeah, yeah, God boss that sounds like a good plan. Like that's

463
00:48:21.92 --> 00:48:27.20
what you're normally getting. You're not normally as a leader. Hopefully you're not normally being

464
00:48:27.20 --> 00:48:32.000
combative. So it's the same thing. How do we train for that?

465
00:48:35.36 --> 00:48:40.08
Bismarck throws a different and more encouraging lead on the problem. It helps us to realize that there are

466
00:48:40.08 --> 00:48:45.04
two forms of practical experience, direct and indirect and that of the two indirect practical

467
00:48:45.04 --> 00:48:50.32
experience may be more valuable because it's infinitely wider. So look you can get that experience

468
00:48:50.32 --> 00:48:55.12
of dealing with a bad employee but how often do you actually deal with? How many Marines did you

469
00:48:55.12 --> 00:49:04.32
have to write up? Hardly any. Yeah, ever. I mean like how many seals that I have to write up?

470
00:49:04.88 --> 00:49:08.56
How many seals that I have to fire? When we're working with companies we work with companies

471
00:49:08.56 --> 00:49:16.80
with thousands of employees. The combative situations are much more rare than the day to day.

472
00:49:16.80 --> 00:49:21.84
Hey, this is what we're doing normal leadership. Yeah, and how often is the problem even as bad

473
00:49:21.84 --> 00:49:26.48
as you think it is? You know, when we'll get questions about how do I deal with the boss who

474
00:49:27.52 --> 00:49:31.76
wants my team to fail? When I say hey, if you really think about the problem, they're not,

475
00:49:31.76 --> 00:49:36.80
they're often not as bad or as significant and not of the magnitude that we even make it out to be.

476
00:49:40.40 --> 00:49:43.76
Even in the most active career, especially as soldiers career, the scope and possibilities of

477
00:49:43.76 --> 00:49:48.40
direct experience are extremely limited in contrast to the military. The medical profession

478
00:49:48.40 --> 00:49:52.64
has an assistant practice, right? They're doing a surgery a day, two surgeries a three surgeries a

479
00:49:53.36 --> 00:49:58.56
yet the greatest achievements in medicine and surgery have usually been due to the research worker

480
00:49:58.56 --> 00:50:04.000
and not to the general practitioner. Direct experience is inherently too limited a form

481
00:50:04.96 --> 00:50:09.76
to form a secure foundation for either theory or application. So if the only combat experience

482
00:50:09.76 --> 00:50:16.16
you're going to get is combat experience. You're going to be screwed. At the best, it produces an

483
00:50:16.16 --> 00:50:24.32
atmosphere which is value in drying and hardening the structure of our thought. If you only have a

484
00:50:24.32 --> 00:50:28.48
little bit of combat experience, that's what you become. If you don't open your mind up.

485
00:50:29.36 --> 00:50:32.64
If you only have a little bit of leadership experience, that's what happens when you get

486
00:50:32.64 --> 00:50:36.96
in the sealed teams. You know, we'd have on the job training leadership. That's how guys would

487
00:50:36.96 --> 00:50:40.24
become that's how they'd get their leadership training. Just by watching their platoon chief or

488
00:50:40.24 --> 00:50:47.12
their platoon commander. So if they weren't good, that bad example would dry and harden in their

489
00:50:47.12 --> 00:50:51.36
mind and become they way they would be too because they didn't open their mind up to different

490
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:58.64
indirect experience. The greater value of indirect experience lies and it's greater variety and

491
00:50:58.64 --> 00:51:05.36
extent, right? History is universal, experience the experience, not of another, but of many others

492
00:51:05.36 --> 00:51:12.56
under manifold conditions. Boom. So we can learn about leadership from everywhere.

493
00:51:14.32 --> 00:51:21.20
Here we have the rational justification for military history. It's preponderant, practical value

494
00:51:21.20 --> 00:51:28.72
in the training and mental development of a soldier. But the benefit depends as with all experience

495
00:51:28.72 --> 00:51:34.08
on its breath, on how closely it approaches the definition quoted above and on the method of studying

496
00:51:34.08 --> 00:51:43.12
it. So we got to study and look the whole premise of this particular podcast is understanding human

497
00:51:43.12 --> 00:51:48.96
nature, is understanding leadership by understanding how people act in war. Why is that? Why don't

498
00:51:48.96 --> 00:51:56.96
we study a bunch of business cases? Well, because if you want to see human nature be revealed,

499
00:51:56.96 --> 00:52:00.56
you've got to put some pressure on it. You've got to put some, there's no better pressure.

500
00:52:00.56 --> 00:52:07.60
No better pressure than combat. Soldiers universally concede the general truth of Napoleon's

501
00:52:07.60 --> 00:52:12.80
much quoted dictum that in war, the moral is to the physical as three to one.

502
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.84
Cool, yeah, we covered that on this podcast and all of Napoleon's maximums. But here we go.

503
00:52:19.84 --> 00:52:26.80
The actual arithmetic proportion may be worthless from morale as apt to decline if weapons be

504
00:52:26.80 --> 00:52:33.52
inadequate and the strongest will is a little use inside of a dead body. But although the moral

505
00:52:33.52 --> 00:52:38.96
and physical factors are inseparable and invisible, the same gains its immortal value because it

506
00:52:38.96 --> 00:52:45.84
expresses the idea of the predominance, the predominance of moral factors in all military decisions.

507
00:52:46.80 --> 00:52:52.64
So obviously it's not like, okay, here's the numerical. You have this much, you have this much physical

508
00:52:52.64 --> 00:52:57.36
situation, open the morale's three to one. That's not what we're talking about, but it's that idea.

509
00:52:59.12 --> 00:53:04.80
On them, constantly turns the issue of worn battle and in history of war, they form the more constant

510
00:53:04.80 --> 00:53:09.36
factors changing only in degree, whereas physical factors are fundamentally different in almost

511
00:53:09.36 --> 00:53:15.52
every war in every military situation. That's the important part of this. That's the important

512
00:53:15.52 --> 00:53:24.72
part of this. You've got the physical factors, right? The physical, but that changes. But what does

513
00:53:24.72 --> 00:53:31.84
and change? The history of war, they form more constant factors to green, changing only in degree.

514
00:53:31.84 --> 00:53:37.84
The physical factors go all over the place because we got machine guns, we got tanks, we got people

515
00:53:37.84 --> 00:53:43.84
with night vision, like it's, there's different physical things but the, but the human nature doesn't

516
00:53:43.84 --> 00:53:50.24
change. This realization affects the whole question of the study of military history for practical use.

517
00:53:50.24 --> 00:53:55.20
The method in the last few generations has been to select one or two campaigns and to study

518
00:53:55.20 --> 00:54:00.24
them exhaustively as means of developing both our minds and a theory of war. But the continual

519
00:54:00.24 --> 00:54:07.60
changes in military means from war to war and tail a grave danger, even a certainty that our

520
00:54:07.60 --> 00:54:16.72
outlook will be narrow and lessens fious. In the physical sphere, the one constant factor is that

521
00:54:16.72 --> 00:54:22.56
means and condition are invariably inconsistent. So the physical stuff we can study it, like,

522
00:54:22.56 --> 00:54:28.000
okay, what, how did you maneuver in a situation? How did you, what weapons did you use over here?

523
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.80
Well, guess what? You fast forward 30 years and we got different weapons. You fast forward six years

524
00:54:32.80 --> 00:54:39.68
and we go from no night vision to all night vision. So that's what we're studying. What are we looking at?

525
00:54:41.28 --> 00:54:48.24
In contrast, human nature varies but slightly in its reaction to danger, some men by race,

526
00:54:48.24 --> 00:54:53.76
by environment or by training may be less sensitive than others but the difference is one of

527
00:54:53.76 --> 00:55:02.000
degree, not fundamental. So people are people. The more localized the situation and our study,

528
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.84
the more disconserting and less count-utable is such a difference of degree. It may prevent

529
00:55:07.84 --> 00:55:11.84
an exact calculation of the resistance which men will offer in any situation but it is not

530
00:55:11.84 --> 00:55:17.12
impaired. The judgment that they will offer less if taken by surprise than if they are on the

531
00:55:17.12 --> 00:55:21.92
alert. This is like, so it doesn't matter where you look in history. The person that's surprised

532
00:55:21.92 --> 00:55:26.72
to person, the person that's on alert, you're going to get the same almost the exact same reaction.

533
00:55:26.72 --> 00:55:30.80
Less if they are weary and hungry than if they are fresh and well fed. Look, we, then, we go back

534
00:55:30.80 --> 00:55:37.36
thousand years, two thousand years. Well fed troops that are well rested are ready to rock and roll.

535
00:55:37.36 --> 00:55:45.28
Weary, hungry, they're not. The broader, the, the broader, the psychological survey, the

536
00:55:45.28 --> 00:55:50.48
better foundation in a force for deductions. So you have to look throughout history and see

537
00:55:50.48 --> 00:55:55.44
all these different battles and see what the psychology of the soldiers and leaders was.

538
00:55:55.44 --> 00:56:01.20
The predominance of the psychological over the physical and its greater consistency

539
00:56:01.92 --> 00:56:07.84
point to the conclusion that the foundation of any theory of war should be as broad as possible.

540
00:56:09.28 --> 00:56:14.40
An intensive study of one campaign, a less based upon, a less based on extensive knowledge

541
00:56:14.40 --> 00:56:19.92
of the whole history of war is as likely to lead us into pitfalls as onto the peaks of military

542
00:56:19.92 --> 00:56:26.40
achievement. So if you just look at one campaign and that's where you base everything on your wrong.

543
00:56:26.40 --> 00:56:33.12
But if a certain effect is seen to follow a certain cause and a score or more cases in different

544
00:56:33.12 --> 00:56:39.36
epochs and diverse conditions, there is ground for regarding this cause as an integral part of

545
00:56:39.36 --> 00:56:45.92
any theory of war. You see something one time, it doesn't mean jack. If you see something four times

546
00:56:45.92 --> 00:56:50.24
but it's all in the same campaign and the same local and the same soldiers fighting against the same

547
00:56:50.24 --> 00:56:56.72
other soldiers, again it's a minimal. But when you take it over centuries or millennia and you see

548
00:56:56.72 --> 00:57:04.40
the same thing over and over again, maybe you should pay attention to that one. The thesis set

549
00:57:04.40 --> 00:57:09.60
forced in this book is the product of such an extensive examination. It might indeed be termed

550
00:57:09.60 --> 00:57:14.56
the compound effect of certain causes these being connected with my task of military editor

551
00:57:14.56 --> 00:57:20.80
for insecticolopedia or Britannica. For all I previously dealt in a various periods of military

552
00:57:20.80 --> 00:57:26.48
history according to my inclination, this task compelled a general survey of all often against

553
00:57:26.48 --> 00:57:31.52
my inclination. So he was the military editor for the insectolopedia or Britannica.

554
00:57:31.52 --> 00:57:34.96
You know what that is, echoed Charles? Of course, yes. I'm just saying, wait, you're millennial?

555
00:57:35.76 --> 00:57:41.52
No, I'm not. Jocco. Okay. Some people I bet a kid right now does not know what

556
00:57:41.52 --> 00:57:49.36
the insectolopedia Britannica was. When we were kids, that was kind of it, right? That was Google.

557
00:57:49.36 --> 00:57:53.92
That was Google. Yep. That was Google. Gotta go find the letter. Yes. Find. Yeah, I'm

558
00:57:53.92 --> 00:57:58.40
not spying. Boom. Pull it out. There you go. And there are some letters that were like two

559
00:57:58.40 --> 00:58:03.12
and one like Q and R. All right. Cool. We're good with that book. With that volume.

560
00:58:05.12 --> 00:58:11.04
So this guy was the editor and the military editor. And even though previously he would just kind

561
00:58:11.04 --> 00:58:13.84
of study what he wanted to study, but then all of a sudden he had to go back and study all these

562
00:58:13.84 --> 00:58:20.88
other things. And he starts seeing all these continual similarities through everything he's

563
00:58:20.88 --> 00:58:29.92
seeing. And here we go. He says in the survey, or even a tourist, if you will, has at least a wide

564
00:58:29.92 --> 00:58:36.24
perspective and at least take in the general live land where the minor knows only his scene.

565
00:58:36.24 --> 00:58:40.88
So if you if you study one war, one battle, and that's what you just go deep in that scene,

566
00:58:41.60 --> 00:58:46.56
you know a lot about that one scene, but the guy that's up an altitude, surveying all land. He's

567
00:58:46.56 --> 00:58:54.64
got the whole lay of the land. During this survey, one impression grew ever stronger that throughout

568
00:58:54.64 --> 00:59:01.92
the age of throughout the ages, decisive results in war have only been reached when the approach has

569
00:59:01.92 --> 00:59:09.68
been indirect. In strategy, the longest way round is apt to be the shortest way home.

570
00:59:16.80 --> 00:59:22.08
More and more clearly has the fact emerged that a direct approach to one's mental object,

571
00:59:22.96 --> 00:59:28.48
or physical objective. And he uses this term a lot as you're going to hear me read. He just

572
00:59:28.48 --> 00:59:33.28
calls something the object. We always call it the objective and he actually goes into like,

573
00:59:33.28 --> 00:59:36.48
why that's not a good word. So a lot of times you'll hear him say object.

574
00:59:39.92 --> 00:59:43.84
More and more clearly has the fact emerged that a direct approach to one's mental object or

575
00:59:43.84 --> 00:59:50.88
physical objective along the line of natural expectation for the opponent has ever tended to

576
00:59:50.88 --> 00:59:55.36
and usually produced negative results. So if you take that path, that's kind of expected.

577
00:59:55.36 --> 01:00:00.96
Chances are we're not going to work out well. The reason has been expressed vividly in

578
01:00:00.96 --> 01:00:06.88
Napoleon's dictum that the moral is to the physical is three to one. It may be expressed scientifically

579
01:00:06.88 --> 01:00:12.88
by saying that while the strength of an enemy country lies outwardly in its numbers and resources,

580
01:00:12.88 --> 01:00:19.12
these are equally dependent upon stability or equilibrium of control, morale, and supply.

581
01:00:19.12 --> 01:00:28.80
To move along the line of natural expectation consolidates the opponent's equilibrium and by

582
01:00:28.80 --> 01:00:40.16
stiffening it, augments his resisting power. I think that comment, the one you made just a minute

583
01:00:40.16 --> 01:00:45.04
to go that quote, the longest way around is the shortest way home. I think that's the piece that

584
01:00:45.04 --> 01:00:53.76
that for whatever reason I think we see is the most hard to accept that. And I think my point is

585
01:00:53.76 --> 01:00:58.000
probably better served by saying the opposite is also true. The shortest way around is the longest way

586
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000
home. If I just get to the point, I will get to the end faster. And the opposite is true. And

587
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:12.56
just the willingness to recognize the more indirect I am. The longer this journey is to get this

588
01:01:12.56 --> 01:01:17.52
other person to see the truth, the faster this is going to be. And that's such a hard thing. I think

589
01:01:17.52 --> 01:01:25.44
for people to embrace, for example, you just said is the more you see me taking this direct path

590
01:01:25.44 --> 01:01:33.28
towards you, the more the more dug in you will become, because you see it coming. And what I'm doing

591
01:01:33.28 --> 01:01:38.72
is so much less important than how I am doing it that you won't hear anything, as I'm saying,

592
01:01:38.72 --> 01:01:42.48
any of the ideas that I'm offering or any of the truth that I'm delivering. And

593
01:01:42.48 --> 01:01:50.56
it will take me longer. And the, I'm a direct person. I have to tell the truth. That's just how I am

594
01:01:50.56 --> 01:01:57.20
the recognition that that is the longest way. And sometimes you'll never get there.

595
01:01:57.20 --> 01:02:04.64
Yep. Yeah. The way I often explain this to clients is I usually just preemptively say, I know what you're

596
01:02:04.64 --> 01:02:09.28
all thinking. You all are thinking, is that doesn't sound very efficient? It'd be much more efficient

597
01:02:09.28 --> 01:02:14.72
for me just to say, Dave, this is how we're doing it. He way more efficient to do that. And it's just,

598
01:02:14.72 --> 01:02:20.64
like you said, it's just so hard to realize that that's the longest way home. That's the longest way home.

599
01:02:22.48 --> 01:02:27.12
The line I just read to move along the line of natural expectation. That's the shortest route.

600
01:02:28.24 --> 01:02:37.12
Consolidates the opponents equilibrium. So when you, when you are going where they expect you to go,

601
01:02:37.12 --> 01:02:42.96
that's where they put their defenses. That's what happens. That's why in Fujitsu, you have to mess

602
01:02:42.96 --> 01:02:50.48
with their balance. You have to come from a different angle. And by stiffening it,

603
01:02:50.48 --> 01:02:55.76
augment its resisting power, by the way. Because when you know where I'm coming at you from, you are

604
01:02:55.76 --> 01:03:05.44
ready to fight. And you know what to do to fight. In war, as in wrestling, the attempt to throw the

605
01:03:05.44 --> 01:03:09.92
opponent without loosening his foothold and balance can only result in self-exhaustion,

606
01:03:09.92 --> 01:03:14.40
increasing in disproportionate ratio to the effective strain put upon him.

607
01:03:15.76 --> 01:03:21.92
Victory by such a method can only be possible through an immense margin of superior strength

608
01:03:21.92 --> 01:03:26.64
in some form and even so tends to lose decisiveness. So if we're wrestling,

609
01:03:27.36 --> 01:03:34.56
which let's face it, we're wrestling. If what we do is attempt a take down with no setup or attempt

610
01:03:34.56 --> 01:03:41.20
a submission with no setup, it doesn't work. It doesn't work. Like we're training with Carrie today.

611
01:03:41.20 --> 01:03:47.84
Carrie's a white belt, right? Guess what? He's a white belt been trained for a year. If you grab

612
01:03:47.84 --> 01:03:52.24
his arm, you're not going to get it. You're not going to get it. You have to do something else.

613
01:03:52.24 --> 01:03:55.60
You have to set him up even a white belt in Fujitsu.

614
01:03:55.60 --> 01:04:06.56
In contrast, an examination of military history, not of one period, but of its whole course,

615
01:04:06.56 --> 01:04:12.96
brings out the point that in almost all the decisive campaigns, the dislocation of the enemy

616
01:04:12.96 --> 01:04:19.52
psychological and physical balance has been vital to a successful attempt at his overthrow.

617
01:04:19.52 --> 01:04:28.32
Dislocation uses that word a lot. Dislocation. Putting people off balance, getting the

618
01:04:28.32 --> 01:04:33.60
getting in their head. Not letting them, well, I guess it's the true opposite of

619
01:04:35.12 --> 01:04:40.000
consolidation of equal in real. Like here I am, I'm stable. Oh, dislocated. Now I'm not where

620
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.28
I want to be. This dislocation has been produced by a strategic and direct approach.

621
01:04:45.28 --> 01:04:51.36
Intentional or fortuitous. Sometimes people just accidentally end up off balancing somebody cool.

622
01:04:52.08 --> 01:04:57.52
It may take varied forms as our analysis reveals for the strategy of the indirect approach is

623
01:04:57.52 --> 01:05:04.40
inclusive of but why and but wider than the maneuver sir, sir, lay, dairy, air.

624
01:05:06.48 --> 01:05:11.04
Which is French. Don't want to be human to try, but it means maneuver behind someone.

625
01:05:11.04 --> 01:05:17.52
Which general came in's research is showed as being the constant aim and key method of Napoleon

626
01:05:17.52 --> 01:05:22.88
in his conduct of operations. While came in was concerned primarily with the logistical moves,

627
01:05:22.88 --> 01:05:29.12
the factors of time, space and communications. This analysis seeks to probe deeper into psychological

628
01:05:29.12 --> 01:05:33.92
foundations and in doing so finds an underlying relationship between many strategic

629
01:05:33.92 --> 01:05:40.16
operations which have no outward resemblance to a maneuver against the enemy's rear yet are.

630
01:05:41.12 --> 01:05:44.88
Nonetheless, definitely vital examples of the strategy of the indirect approach.

631
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.92
So sometimes it doesn't look like what you're doing is an indirect maneuver, but it is.

632
01:05:54.88 --> 01:06:00.000
To trace this relationship and determine the character of operations is not necessary

633
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:06.56
and is indeed irrelevant to tabulate the numerical strengths and detail the details of supply and

634
01:06:06.56 --> 01:06:10.72
transport are concerned as simply with historical effects in a comprehensive series of cases

635
01:06:11.36 --> 01:06:16.88
and with the logistical or psychological moves which led up to them.

636
01:06:17.60 --> 01:06:23.52
If similar effects follow fundamentally similar moves in conditions which vary widely in scale,

637
01:06:23.52 --> 01:06:28.32
nature and date, there's clearly an underlying connection from which we can logically deduce a

638
01:06:28.32 --> 01:06:34.48
common cause and the more widely the conditions vary the firmer of this conduction, this deduction

639
01:06:34.48 --> 01:06:40.96
and what he's saying there is look when you take a bunch of examples over time throughout history,

640
01:06:41.28 --> 01:06:45.20
it becomes really clear that this isn't just a fluke, this is the reality of the situation

641
01:06:46.88 --> 01:06:49.28
and that's so so here's what we're going to do.

642
01:06:49.28 --> 01:07:01.20
So this guy is a historian and the next giant chunk of these books is he goes historical.

643
01:07:01.20 --> 01:07:03.84
What was that book we read in the book where people went statistical?

644
01:07:03.84 --> 01:07:07.44
Oh yeah, that's right. It was one of those world war II things. Somebody went statistical.

645
01:07:08.72 --> 01:07:13.20
The officer went statistical law and he started telling me about how long officers were living.

646
01:07:13.20 --> 01:07:17.92
He said the average officer is living about 5,5 hours up there. Good luck.

647
01:07:17.92 --> 01:07:22.40
He went statistical law me. What B.A.S. LeDell Hart does he goes historical?

648
01:07:23.44 --> 01:07:30.08
And he goes from the 5th century to the 20th century. He goes from the Greek wars, the Roman wars,

649
01:07:30.08 --> 01:07:34.40
the Byzantine wars, the medieval wars, the 17th century, the 18th century, the French Revolution,

650
01:07:34.40 --> 01:07:40.64
Napoleon, he gets to the first world war, the second world war, and he goes through

651
01:07:40.64 --> 01:07:50.16
just detailed battles and talks about the indirect approach. And what we're going to do is

652
01:07:50.16 --> 01:07:55.28
we're actually going to bypass those and there's a couple of reasons why. Number one, get the books.

653
01:07:56.16 --> 01:08:00.000
Get the books. Number two. This is what we do all the time on this podcast. This is actually

654
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.60
what we do all the time on this podcast. We talk about Napoleon. We talk about his person Russia.

655
01:08:05.60 --> 01:08:09.28
We talk about World War I. We talk about World War II. We talk about Vietnam. We talk about

656
01:08:09.28 --> 01:08:15.92
Korea. And we've seen and pointed out the indirect strategy all the time. All the time. That's what we do.

657
01:08:15.92 --> 01:08:21.28
We how do I usually talk about it? The flank. This is what we talked about maneuver warfare.

658
01:08:21.28 --> 01:08:25.20
This is what this is about. This is what this whole podcast is about. It's these historical lessons.

659
01:08:25.84 --> 01:08:32.16
And B.A. LeDell Hart. He serves them up for us in this book.

660
01:08:32.16 --> 01:08:39.92
So, so if you want to get those, who knows, maybe one day we'll jump into these.

661
01:08:41.76 --> 01:08:46.56
But if you want to jump into them, get the book. Get the book strategy by B.A. LeDell Hart. You can get

662
01:08:47.20 --> 01:08:53.76
in-depth on these things. But what I want to do is I want to kind of jump ahead to his book

663
01:08:53.76 --> 01:09:03.04
strategy where he goes into the theory of strategy. And he starts off by saying having drawn our

664
01:09:03.04 --> 01:09:06.56
conclusions from analysis. Oh, by the way, the analysis that he's talking about that he draws

665
01:09:06.56 --> 01:09:12.40
conclusion from is like 315 pages. So this is no, this is when he's talking about, oh, what?

666
01:09:12.40 --> 01:09:16.48
You need to study all these different eras. He does it. And points out the indirect

667
01:09:16.48 --> 01:09:24.32
approach and how it wins every single time. Even if it was by accident, it's what makes us win. He says,

668
01:09:24.32 --> 01:09:30.08
having drawn our conclusions from analysis of history, it seems advantageous to construct on the

669
01:09:30.08 --> 01:09:36.000
fresh foundation of a new dwelling house for the strategic thought. So he's looked at all these things

670
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:44.16
that have happened. And we got to kind of get, we kind of got to hit the reset button. He says,

671
01:09:44.16 --> 01:09:53.84
let us first be clear on what is strategy. Clouds fits in his monumental work on war, defined it as

672
01:09:53.84 --> 01:10:00.32
the art of the employment of battles as a means to gain the object of war. In other words,

673
01:10:00.32 --> 01:10:06.48
strategy comes strategy forms the plan of war maps out the proposed course of the different campaigns

674
01:10:06.48 --> 01:10:14.16
which compose the war and regulates the battles to be fought in each. Now, this is probably

675
01:10:14.16 --> 01:10:19.36
since episode 7 of this podcast, people have been okay, you can do classmates, you can do classmates

676
01:10:19.36 --> 01:10:24.16
on war, hey, you can do one more. And there's a couple of reasons why I haven't done it yet,

677
01:10:24.16 --> 01:10:33.76
and I'm sure we will, and I owe it to military history to do it. But there's a couple of reasons.

678
01:10:33.76 --> 01:10:38.32
One reason it's like kind of, it's such a popular one, that's hey, you know what, that's right out there,

679
01:10:38.32 --> 01:10:47.84
is it really the first one I want to hit? I'd rather hit some other strategic ideas. I mean,

680
01:10:47.84 --> 01:10:55.28
I guess I did do Sun Siwon war. So this is one of the excuse, maybe? I've always known

681
01:10:55.28 --> 01:11:00.72
that classmates, or I always felt that classmates, you know, respect, respect,

682
01:11:00.72 --> 01:11:05.76
classmates, we're giving him respect. By the way, here's why this,

683
01:11:05.76 --> 01:11:10.88
classmates is no just hey military theorist, right? This is a guy that sat in a ivory tower and

684
01:11:10.88 --> 01:11:17.28
fought about war. He entered the military at age 12 as a Lance Corporal. You know what I'm saying?

685
01:11:17.28 --> 01:11:24.40
Like this is no joke. fought in the Ryan campaigns, fought in the Napoleonic Wars,

686
01:11:24.40 --> 01:11:31.44
went to the military academy at Berlin, worked for Sean Horses, who I've talked about a bunch

687
01:11:31.44 --> 01:11:35.52
on this podcast because when it comes to maneuver warfare, he's kind of that guy in the beginning

688
01:11:35.52 --> 01:11:41.60
that lost with the press normie to Napoleon at the Battle of Jenna. And when he did, he looked

689
01:11:41.60 --> 01:11:45.84
around and said, what the hell just happened and realized there was some decentralized, some indirect

690
01:11:45.84 --> 01:11:51.20
warfare going on and started kind of making that. Well, well, CrossFit's kind of was under his wing.

691
01:11:51.20 --> 01:12:00.08
And then when the Prussians made an alliance with Napoleon, CrossFit's was like no,

692
01:12:00.08 --> 01:12:04.48
and he joined the Imperial Russian army. And then when they broke up that alliance, he went back

693
01:12:04.48 --> 01:12:10.24
to the the Prussian army. It was a Chief of Staff of three Corps and just battles,

694
01:12:10.96 --> 01:12:18.96
Napoleonic battles at the Battle of Waterloo. He was in that campaign. He was preventing

695
01:12:18.96 --> 01:12:24.96
some of Napoleon's reinforcements and showing up, which obviously caused the problem.

696
01:12:25.84 --> 01:12:31.44
When back was an instructor at the then the director of the military academy at Berlin,

697
01:12:33.20 --> 01:12:36.40
and by the way, this whole time he's writing down what his thoughts are.

698
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.24
And then he ended up dying of color before he had these before he was able to complete his works.

699
01:12:44.24 --> 01:12:50.16
And really before you might say, and LaDelle Hart kind of makes the assumption that he was kind

700
01:12:50.16 --> 01:12:58.32
of heading in a different direction. So he's respectful but critical of CrossFit's, that's kind of,

701
01:12:58.32 --> 01:13:02.80
that's, I don't want to say that's the way I've always felt, but I kind of have always felt that

702
01:13:02.80 --> 01:13:09.20
way a little bit. I don't know, maybe that's because I'm a little bit of a contrarian,

703
01:13:09.20 --> 01:13:16.64
but maybe more than that, CrossFit says things that I go, really, really.

704
01:13:19.76 --> 01:13:25.76
And by the way, the CrossFit's mentality is kind of what brought us to World War I.

705
01:13:26.40 --> 01:13:35.76
And that mentality of mass, which is what it is, premier, a principles, is like, hey, we're going to get,

706
01:13:35.76 --> 01:13:41.84
I have more people than you, I'm going to win, which as we know, when we compare that to the,

707
01:13:44.64 --> 01:13:47.28
principles behind light infantry, it's not what we're looking for.

708
01:13:49.92 --> 01:13:54.24
There's also a connection in there too, even between what was talking about earlier,

709
01:13:54.24 --> 01:14:00.72
between the physical and the moral of these physical attributes. And they vary from campaign

710
01:14:00.72 --> 01:14:04.72
to campaign, which is part of the reason why you don't want to overreact to the less,

711
01:14:04.72 --> 01:14:10.16
the physical lessons of a particular campaign, because even as simple as like desert warfare versus

712
01:14:10.16 --> 01:14:14.80
jungle warfare, those lessons, forwarding rivers, those are physical lessons, and then they're

713
01:14:14.80 --> 01:14:24.80
not that they're invaluable, but the physical principles of mass or those components are less

714
01:14:24.80 --> 01:14:29.36
important. Now, one of that, the other, you have to have them both, but I was even just sitting

715
01:14:29.36 --> 01:14:35.92
here thinking of when Tom Fif was here, who's talking about World War II, Korean Vietnam, not from

716
01:14:37.60 --> 01:14:42.96
historical standpoint, but actually a participant standpoint. But the lessons he was talking about,

717
01:14:42.96 --> 01:14:46.96
he didn't spend a bunch of time on World War II we were dealing with this physical environment. It was

718
01:14:48.16 --> 01:14:53.12
the universal, the universal nature of his lessons were take care of your people.

719
01:14:53.12 --> 01:14:59.04
I'm going to tell you how to look, if I listen to you on this podcast, read, that the fundamental

720
01:14:59.04 --> 01:15:05.68
principle of leadership in success and battle was taking care of your people. I'm looking at

721
01:15:05.68 --> 01:15:09.92
about face as I'm looking at hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages, and he probably has a

722
01:15:09.92 --> 01:15:15.12
whole bunch of physical lessons. And it's not to say that those aren't important, but those are

723
01:15:15.12 --> 01:15:19.36
never the ones that the leaders really, when they're talking about the lessons they learn and that

724
01:15:19.36 --> 01:15:24.000
moral component, I'm just using moral to use the same language. It's the human nature piece

725
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.12
like you were talking about, and how much more important that is. And I remember even in getting a

726
01:15:29.12 --> 01:15:33.52
master's degree was, was cost with sort of central to the strategic studies, and there's a

727
01:15:33.52 --> 01:15:40.24
physical focus on that. And the principle of his master's a great example. And listen,

728
01:15:41.28 --> 01:15:46.16
I would love to go to war with an advantage in master every time. That'd be awesome.

729
01:15:46.16 --> 01:15:50.08
But we know that that's not the deciding factor. We know that.

730
01:15:52.08 --> 01:15:58.16
Interestingly, as you pointed to about face, there's one book that we haven't covered on this

731
01:15:58.16 --> 01:16:03.04
podcast by Colonel David Hackworth, which you would think would be just like prime. It's called

732
01:16:03.04 --> 01:16:09.04
Vietnam, Vietnam primer. And Vietnam primer is a book to get you ready to go to Vietnam. And it literally

733
01:16:09.04 --> 01:16:14.80
shows like, hey, here's how far out you should put your clay more. It's, it's just, we could

734
01:16:14.80 --> 01:16:21.04
cover it. I'm sure we could, we could get some lessons from it. But compared to about face, not even close.

735
01:16:21.04 --> 01:16:25.44
Here's the other thing that's interesting. Is that cover move, right? Cover move

736
01:16:27.12 --> 01:16:33.20
the first law of combat leadership. If you're in the jungle, you better cover move. If you're in

737
01:16:33.20 --> 01:16:38.24
the desert, you better cover move. If you're doing a river crossing, you better cover move. If you're

738
01:16:38.24 --> 01:16:44.64
doing an assault, you better cover move. If you're in an airplane, if you're in an airplane, at 38,000

739
01:16:44.64 --> 01:16:53.84
feet, AC kicking, you better cover move. So that's, I think what was weird for me was as like

740
01:16:53.84 --> 01:17:04.24
cover move, and that's another thing. Cover and move. Cover and move. Movement. You win by maneuver.

741
01:17:04.24 --> 01:17:11.20
You don't win by sitting still. And when you start talking about classmates and mass, it's like,

742
01:17:11.20 --> 01:17:19.36
we're here. Yeah. So that's again, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to like get crazy and

743
01:17:20.08 --> 01:17:26.88
to talk smack about classmates. Like I said, if you were a Lance Corporal at age 12, I salute you,

744
01:17:26.88 --> 01:17:36.88
and I will listen to what the hell you have to say 100%. But I will not, I will question anybody.

745
01:17:36.88 --> 01:17:42.56
I question, I question hack worth. Read my opening. Like, there's like, hey man,

746
01:17:42.56 --> 01:17:49.04
guy was not perfect. I mean, he's, he, you use him as the prime example of a lesson we teach

747
01:17:49.04 --> 01:17:55.68
in business all the time is if you lose your influence, and he and, and probably the most influential

748
01:17:55.68 --> 01:18:00.08
figure in your life as a leader is still your prime example of what not to do in a particular

749
01:18:00.08 --> 01:18:04.32
situation. So I think the contrarian component of it is, is important. What, what, what,

750
01:18:04.32 --> 01:18:08.16
crosswords is awesome, on war is awesome. There's a bunch of good stuff in there too.

751
01:18:08.16 --> 01:18:13.76
For sure. And I know that you're saying that, but just a link it back to that conversation and

752
01:18:15.36 --> 01:18:21.12
the human nature component and thinking about the director approach and thinking of human nature.

753
01:18:21.12 --> 01:18:25.12
If you just thought before you took the director approach and anything, how would I react to

754
01:18:25.12 --> 01:18:29.52
someone doing that to me? 99% of the director, and 99% of the director's assaults would go away.

755
01:18:29.52 --> 01:18:37.60
If you could just take that perspective on it, unless you lied to yourself, seriously.

756
01:18:37.60 --> 01:18:42.32
Yeah. Like, unless you lied to yourself, which many, many, many people will do, which is,

757
01:18:42.32 --> 01:18:46.16
maybe I just want Dave just to come up. Hey, if I'm wrong, just come and tell me. Yeah.

758
01:18:46.16 --> 01:18:50.24
Like, if you lied to yourself, then you, you probably just keep taking the director approach

759
01:18:50.24 --> 01:18:54.08
all the time. Yeah, which is not going to work out. And if you're, if you're the person that

760
01:18:54.08 --> 01:18:59.84
prides themselves in listening to other people's director's assaults on you, there's high risk

761
01:18:59.84 --> 01:19:07.60
through that you are lying to yourself. Check. All right. Back to the book. One defect of this

762
01:19:07.60 --> 01:19:15.84
definition that was the definition of of strategy, which was the art of employment of battles as

763
01:19:15.84 --> 01:19:23.84
means to gain the object of war. So that's Karlswitz's definition. One defect of this definition

764
01:19:23.84 --> 01:19:30.16
is that it intrudes on the sphere of policy or the higher conduct of war, which must necessarily

765
01:19:30.16 --> 01:19:36.000
be the responsibility of government and not of military leaders. It employs as its agents

766
01:19:36.72 --> 01:19:41.84
in the executive control of operations. So he's, he's going to go through this, but there's,

767
01:19:41.84 --> 01:19:45.12
you know, you know, we say all the time, you can have things to teach you all the time.

768
01:19:45.12 --> 01:19:49.76
That's what he's about to about to address 14 different ways. And he's going to actually go

769
01:19:49.76 --> 01:19:54.24
into a chapter, I don't know if we'll get there today, but there's a higher level strategy called

770
01:19:54.24 --> 01:20:02.56
Grand Strategy. And so he's thinking Grand Strategy policy. Another defect is that it narrows the

771
01:20:02.56 --> 01:20:10.08
meaning of strategy to the pure utilization of battle, thus conveying the idea that battle is the

772
01:20:10.08 --> 01:20:17.36
only means to the strategic end. It was an easy step for Karlswitz less profound disciples to

773
01:20:17.36 --> 01:20:24.24
confuse the means with the end and to reach the conclusion that in war, in every, in war,

774
01:20:24.24 --> 01:20:30.32
every other consideration should be subordinated to the aim of fighting a decisive battle.

775
01:20:32.64 --> 01:20:36.56
So, so think about that. That's your attitude is like, hey, the whole purpose of strategy is

776
01:20:36.56 --> 01:20:40.40
to engage in decisive battle. That's what we're doing. So then what are you doing in World War I?

777
01:20:40.40 --> 01:20:44.96
You put more people on the line and you put more people on the line and you put more people on

778
01:20:44.96 --> 01:20:50.16
line. You send another battalion, another brigade, another division over the top. That's what you do.

779
01:20:51.60 --> 01:20:57.20
And there's people that lead like this in companies and organizations and their families,

780
01:20:57.20 --> 01:21:02.16
and the way they lead is by trying to win battles. That's the way they lead.

781
01:21:05.04 --> 01:21:09.52
And the commitment that every argument is a decisive battle that has to be won.

782
01:21:09.52 --> 01:21:18.40
And not being able to recognize, and I think, I think he called them like inflection points or

783
01:21:18.40 --> 01:21:24.24
something along the lines of the recognition of, this is where it, this is decisive. And being

784
01:21:24.24 --> 01:21:30.48
able to recognize what an inflection point is in combat. As opposed to like every engagement is not

785
01:21:30.48 --> 01:21:33.92
an inflection point. It's not a decisive point and being able to recognize where those points are.

786
01:21:33.92 --> 01:21:41.76
And fighting those, as opposed to every single engagement, you mean the idea of picking your battles?

787
01:21:42.96 --> 01:21:47.20
Hey, pick your battles. Who's been told that before? Yeah. Hey, pick your battles.

788
01:21:48.24 --> 01:21:54.72
Comments seems like such common sense and yet all the time people look at every discussion,

789
01:21:54.72 --> 01:22:00.24
argument, contention as the decisive battle for their echo. Yeah.

790
01:22:00.24 --> 01:22:06.32
Relation of policy to break down the distinction between strategy and policy would not matter

791
01:22:06.32 --> 01:22:10.72
much if the two functions were normally combined in the same person as with Frederick or Napoleon.

792
01:22:10.72 --> 01:22:16.32
But, but as such, autocratic soldier rulers have been rare in modern times and became temporarily

793
01:22:16.32 --> 01:22:21.12
extinct for the 19th century. The effect was in city, it's the harmful for it encouraged soldiers

794
01:22:21.12 --> 01:22:28.000
to make preposterous claim that policy should be subservient to their conduct of operations. And

795
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.48
especially in democratic countries, it drew statesmen onto overstep the definite border of his fear

796
01:22:34.48 --> 01:22:37.52
and interfere with his military employees and the actual use of their tools.

797
01:22:39.76 --> 01:22:44.56
So there's gotta be a line between these two things. And we gotta stay in our lanes a little bit.

798
01:22:44.56 --> 01:22:48.72
Hey, here's the policy. How do you want to execute it? Hey, here's the resources I need. Oh, don't

799
01:22:48.72 --> 01:22:58.32
know change your policy. Molky reached a clearer and wiser definition in terming strategy

800
01:22:59.20 --> 01:23:05.12
quote, the practical adaptation of the means placed at a general's disposal to the attainment of the

801
01:23:05.12 --> 01:23:17.76
object in view. Molky is another Prussian guy chief general in the 1860s and he's the guy that kind of

802
01:23:17.76 --> 01:23:24.16
I would say he had that the idea of the making sure you have an overall objective. I make sure that

803
01:23:24.16 --> 01:23:32.56
people understand what the overall objective is. The German word, Alph-Trog-Stactic. No.

804
01:23:34.88 --> 01:23:40.24
Overall objective. This definition fixes the responsibility of a military commander to the

805
01:23:40.24 --> 01:23:45.28
government by which he is employed. His responsibility is that of applying most proactively

806
01:23:45.28 --> 01:23:49.44
to the interest of higher war policy, the force allowed it to him within the theater of operations

807
01:23:49.44 --> 01:23:54.80
assigned to him. If he considers that the force allowed it is inadequate for the task indicated,

808
01:23:54.80 --> 01:24:01.68
he is justified in putting this out. And if his opinion is overruled, he can refuse or resign the command.

809
01:24:02.96 --> 01:24:07.52
But he exceeds his rightful sphere if he attempts to dictate to the government what measure

810
01:24:07.52 --> 01:24:13.84
force should be placed at his disposal. So like I said, there's a line here that he's talking about.

811
01:24:13.84 --> 01:24:19.36
On the other hand, the government which formulates war policy and has to adapt to it to

812
01:24:19.36 --> 01:24:24.40
conditions which often changes a war progresses can rightly intervene in the strategy of a campaign

813
01:24:24.40 --> 01:24:29.12
not merely by replacing a commander in whom it is lost confidence but by modifying his

814
01:24:29.12 --> 01:24:35.36
object according to the needs of its war policy. While it should not interfere with him and handling

815
01:24:35.36 --> 01:24:42.000
of his tools, it should indicate clearly the nature of his task. Thus strategy has not necessarily

816
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.44
the simple object of seeking to overthrow the enemy's military power. When a government appreciates

817
01:24:47.44 --> 01:24:52.72
that the enemy has the military superiority, either in general or in a particular theater, it may

818
01:24:52.72 --> 01:25:00.48
be wise to enjoy a strategy of limited aim. Before I get into limited aim, let's tie this back

819
01:25:00.48 --> 01:25:05.76
to corporate leadership and business leadership. What are you doing if you're in charge?

820
01:25:05.76 --> 01:25:11.92
To make sure that you are empowering your subordinate leaders to make things happen.

821
01:25:12.80 --> 01:25:16.16
And not saying, hey, here's exactly how I want you to do it. Here's what I want you to do with

822
01:25:16.16 --> 01:25:20.96
your team. Here's what I want you to do with your tools. Here's how that's when you're crossing the line.

823
01:25:20.96 --> 01:25:24.16
You shouldn't have to do that. You shouldn't have to have those conversations.

824
01:25:25.12 --> 01:25:28.000
We should be able to say, hey Dave, this is what we're trying to make happen.

825
01:25:28.72 --> 01:25:34.48
How do you want to do it? And Dave, who's on the front line, says, hey boss, here's what I'm thinking.

826
01:25:34.48 --> 01:25:39.52
It looks good. Go execute. And by the way, Dave might come back saying to hey boss, we can't do that.

827
01:25:39.52 --> 01:25:43.68
Unless you give me some more resources. And I say, hey, it's all we got. Sorry. And you say,

828
01:25:43.68 --> 01:25:49.12
what we need to come back then, or we need to not do this market area, because we don't have the

829
01:25:49.12 --> 01:25:53.68
resource. We need to, okay, cool. Or maybe I say, well, I think it's just because you suck.

830
01:25:54.56 --> 01:26:00.64
You're fired echo. You got the con. Yeah. So let's make sure that we delineate the roles and

831
01:26:00.64 --> 01:26:06.000
responsibilities clearly enough that we know what what we're trying to do up and down the chain of command.

832
01:26:06.64 --> 01:26:15.12
Now to get back to this point of strategy of limited aim, he goes into it a little bit here.

833
01:26:16.24 --> 01:26:20.32
This is the strategy of limited limited limited aim. It may desire to wait until the balance of

834
01:26:20.32 --> 01:26:26.000
force can be changed by the intervention of allies or by the transfer of forces from another theater.

835
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.92
It may desire to wait or even limit its military effort permanently while economic or naval

836
01:26:31.92 --> 01:26:36.88
action decides the issues. It may calculate that the overthrow of the enemy's military power is a

837
01:26:36.88 --> 01:26:42.88
task definitely beyond its capacity and not worth the effort. And that the object of its war policy

838
01:26:42.88 --> 01:26:48.88
can be assured by seizing territory, which it can either retrain, retain, or use as a bargaining

839
01:26:48.88 --> 01:26:53.20
counter when peace is negotiated. So right, every one of those things is indirect.

840
01:26:53.20 --> 01:26:58.72
It's a limited aim. It's like, oh, you know what? I wanted to kick Dave's ass.

841
01:26:59.84 --> 01:27:05.68
But he's way bigger and way better at jujitsu than I thought he was. So you know what I'm going to do?

842
01:27:06.24 --> 01:27:15.20
I'm on a like say, hey, man, instead of what us fighting, why don't I buy you a hamburger?

843
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.36
And we'll talk about some stuff. And what you know what I'm saying? Like it's a different,

844
01:27:19.36 --> 01:27:24.32
it's just taking a different approach. It's totally different approach. We know what? I think Dave

845
01:27:24.32 --> 01:27:30.48
can actually kick my ass. Echo is going to be hearing about 30 minutes. Echo is bigger and stronger

846
01:27:30.48 --> 01:27:34.08
than Dave. He's been training more than just so I'm going to wait till hey, hey Dave, you

847
01:27:34.08 --> 01:27:38.48
might have to wait. I'd rather have you roll with Echo. Right, so I'm bringing in some reinforcements.

848
01:27:40.16 --> 01:27:44.88
That's the strategy of limited, limited aim. Such a policy has more support from history than

849
01:27:44.88 --> 01:27:51.68
military opinion has recognized and is less inherently a policy of weakness than some apologists.

850
01:27:51.68 --> 01:27:55.12
And, by so just because I say, you know what Dave, I'm not really looking to roll with your

851
01:27:55.12 --> 01:28:03.12
way to let go gets here. That's not necessarily weak. In fact, it might be smarter. In fact,

852
01:28:03.12 --> 01:28:07.84
if I think you can beat me and I'm pretty sure you're going to beat me, it's way smarter for me

853
01:28:07.84 --> 01:28:12.40
to wait till Echo shows up to kick your ass. It isn't indeed bound up with the history of the

854
01:28:12.40 --> 01:28:18.48
British Empire and repeatedly proved a life buoy to Britain's allies as well as of the permanent

855
01:28:18.48 --> 01:28:23.84
benefit to herself. However, unconsciously followed, there's ground for inquiry, whether this

856
01:28:23.84 --> 01:28:28.88
conservative military policy does not deserve to be accorded a place in the theory of the

857
01:28:28.88 --> 01:28:34.72
conduct of war. So how often did Britain go, you know what? Maybe we don't want to fight that war.

858
01:28:34.72 --> 01:28:38.80
Maybe we want to give that up. Maybe we want to give that area. Maybe we need it's bargain and

859
01:28:38.80 --> 01:28:43.92
move into an area that we know we can take and then we'll negotiate for it back later.

860
01:28:47.20 --> 01:28:52.32
The more usual reason for adopting a strategy of limited aim is that of awaiting a change in

861
01:28:52.32 --> 01:28:58.48
the balance of force waiting till Echo shows up. A change often sought and achieved by draining

862
01:28:58.48 --> 01:29:04.16
the enemies' force weakening him by tricks instead of risking blows. What if, well, you know what?

863
01:29:04.16 --> 01:29:08.56
Hey, Dave, I don't, you know, I don't really want to roll today. Echo is going to be here in a little while,

864
01:29:08.56 --> 01:29:12.64
but while you're waiting, launch a roll a couple rounds with Kerry and launch a roll a couple rounds

865
01:29:12.64 --> 01:29:17.12
with Dean and then so here you are fighting all these battles by the time Echo Charles shows up

866
01:29:17.12 --> 01:29:22.24
fresh. He's just had a discipline go. He's ready to rock and roll your tired, your nine rounds deep.

867
01:29:22.96 --> 01:29:30.80
That's my, that's a great plan. Great plan. So I weakened you by tricks instead of risking blows.

868
01:29:30.80 --> 01:29:35.44
The essential condition of strategy, such a strategy is that the drain on him should be disperse

869
01:29:35.44 --> 01:29:39.20
portionetly greater than all oneself because I was sitting over on the corner keeping time.

870
01:29:40.40 --> 01:29:45.28
That's what I was doing while you were rolling with guy after guy after guy. I'm keeping track of time for you.

871
01:29:47.92 --> 01:29:52.16
The object may be sought by rating his supplies by local attacks, which annihilator and flick

872
01:29:52.16 --> 01:29:56.32
disperse portionet loss on parts of his force by lowering him into unprofitable attacks,

873
01:29:56.32 --> 01:30:03.68
by causing an excessively wide distribution on his force and no least by exhausting his moral and physical

874
01:30:03.68 --> 01:30:08.48
energy. This is like the exact example, right? I don't think I can kick your ass, but you know what,

875
01:30:08.48 --> 01:30:12.32
Echo is going to be here in a little while and in the meantime, I'm going to entice, I'm going to go,

876
01:30:12.32 --> 01:30:18.72
hey, hey Dean, go get a couple rounds. Go, go, go get a couple rounds of Dave, boom, and just rough you up

877
01:30:18.96 --> 01:30:22.88
and going to hit you with a couple different people by the time Echo shows up, no factor.

878
01:30:22.88 --> 01:30:30.08
That's what I'm doing. Yeah, and I'm also thinking of just the idea of even going to war with

879
01:30:30.08 --> 01:30:35.04
the American military and most of our opponents, certainly more recent history, the aim wasn't

880
01:30:35.04 --> 01:30:42.16
to destroy the American military. It was to make those series of little tricks over time become

881
01:30:42.16 --> 01:30:48.000
intolerable where we are no longer willing to have these little successive losses. So we're not

882
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.92
going to have that decisive campaign at all because you made this intolerable for me and that connection

883
01:30:53.92 --> 01:30:58.16
of policy too. We talked about that all the time of, you know, the will, you know, somebody's will

884
01:30:58.16 --> 01:31:02.40
to be doing that as, hey, I don't want to keep doing this over and over again. These small little

885
01:31:02.40 --> 01:31:08.56
things, these little, those things add up over time, as opposed to like somehow the objective is

886
01:31:08.56 --> 01:31:14.32
we're going to have a force on force, you know, culminating event between some military and the

887
01:31:14.32 --> 01:31:19.44
American military, which, which, again, generically speaking, nobody wants that. We want to have a

888
01:31:19.44 --> 01:31:22.88
decisive engagement with the American military. So we're going to do some other things instead

889
01:31:22.88 --> 01:31:29.92
and make that intolerable for us. Which, by the way, we suck in many areas of this, the United

890
01:31:29.92 --> 01:31:34.56
States in general, think of the propaganda damage that gets done to us on a regular basis that

891
01:31:34.56 --> 01:31:40.96
has been done to us on a regular basis, basically since Vietnam. Anytime we get into, I mean,

892
01:31:40.96 --> 01:31:47.12
anytime we get into a conflict now, the propaganda that is used to turn us against ourselves and

893
01:31:47.12 --> 01:31:53.28
this country is, it's, it's crazy how effective it is. You, you look at the Vietnam War,

894
01:31:54.80 --> 01:32:01.76
it's crazy how effective they were at turning Americans against Americans in that war. Yeah.

895
01:32:05.36 --> 01:32:09.76
Back to the book. This closer definition, Sheds light on the question previously raised of a

896
01:32:09.76 --> 01:32:13.36
General's Independence in carrying out his own strategy inside his theater of operations.

897
01:32:14.16 --> 01:32:21.92
For if the, for if the government has decided upon a limited aim or grand strategy, the general who,

898
01:32:21.92 --> 01:32:27.20
even within his strategic fear seeks to overthrow the enemy's military power, may do more harm

899
01:32:27.20 --> 01:32:31.36
than good to the government's war policy. So what is that saying? That saying like, I got

900
01:32:31.36 --> 01:32:34.64
Dave out there. He's super aggressive and he's like, you know what I'm going to, I'm going to take this whole

901
01:32:34.64 --> 01:32:37.84
area. And meanwhile, I'm thinking, Dave, don't take that whole area, then we're going to have to occupy it.

902
01:32:37.84 --> 01:32:41.12
I don't have the people to occupy it. And now we're going to cause more problems. So just because

903
01:32:41.12 --> 01:32:47.92
you're winning doesn't mean you're winning. Yeah. Usually a war of limited aim, a war policy

904
01:32:47.92 --> 01:32:52.56
of limited aim imposes the strategy of limited aim. And a decisive aim should only be adopted

905
01:32:52.56 --> 01:32:59.28
with the approval of the government, which alone can decide whether it is worth the candle.

906
01:33:00.16 --> 01:33:03.52
Old school expression. I didn't really know what it meant. I had to look it up.

907
01:33:03.52 --> 01:33:09.20
Worth the candle means we're going to do something is what we're doing worth the candle, that

908
01:33:09.20 --> 01:33:12.40
the light it's going to take to for us to be able to do whatever we're doing. Yeah.

909
01:33:12.40 --> 01:33:15.60
Because it weren't the candle. Like we're going to, oh, we got some work to do tonight.

910
01:33:15.60 --> 01:33:17.92
Cool, light the candle. But how much are we really going to get done?

911
01:33:17.92 --> 01:33:24.000
It's not worth the candle. It's back in the day. Kind of like it's the juice worth the squeeze.

912
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:32.72
Exactly. We can now arrive at a shorter definition of strategy as quote,

913
01:33:32.72 --> 01:33:39.68
the art of distributing and applying military means to fulfill the ends of policy and quote.

914
01:33:40.72 --> 01:33:47.44
For strategy is concerned not merely with the movement of forces as it rolls off and defined,

915
01:33:47.44 --> 01:33:54.88
but with the effect. When the application of the military instrument merges into actual

916
01:33:54.88 --> 01:34:03.76
fighting the dispositions for and control of such direct action are termed tactics. The two categories

917
01:34:03.76 --> 01:34:07.60
of low convenient for discussion can never be truly divided into separate compartments

918
01:34:07.60 --> 01:34:13.68
because each, not only influences but merges into the other, which is why leadership strategy

919
01:34:13.68 --> 01:34:18.48
in taxes is called leadership strategy and tactics. Kind of convenient that it worked out that way.

920
01:34:18.48 --> 01:34:29.04
But listen, here's what's important. Is what we're doing? It doesn't matter. What matters is

921
01:34:29.04 --> 01:34:33.84
how it ends up. What matters is the strategic effect. That's why we have to think strategic all the

922
01:34:33.84 --> 01:34:44.72
time. That's what we need to do. Next section, higher or grand strategy. As tactics in,

923
01:34:44.72 --> 01:34:49.84
as tactics is an application of strategy on a lower plane, so strategy is an application on a

924
01:34:49.84 --> 01:34:55.68
lower plane of grand strategy. So he goes to one level up, a whole other thing. We got tactical,

925
01:34:55.68 --> 01:34:59.44
we got operational, he isn't really talking about operational. That must be a modern thing.

926
01:34:59.44 --> 01:35:07.12
Tactical, operational, strategic and then grand strategy. While practically synonymous with policy,

927
01:35:07.12 --> 01:35:13.12
what was your, would you study in college? Policy. Thanks, what's up, man? You want to chime in a little

928
01:35:13.12 --> 01:35:18.16
bit. I do. Let's know. You're rolling, man. But I mean, there's so much class was he and stuff in there.

929
01:35:18.16 --> 01:35:24.72
But the previous comment, it was, as I'm thinking of sort of like the business alignment of this,

930
01:35:24.72 --> 01:35:30.88
this military concept is, how often are we engaged in tactical battles that don't

931
01:35:31.52 --> 01:35:37.44
promote or support the strategic goal? And I think it was, I think it was the debris podcast, but you said

932
01:35:37.44 --> 01:35:46.24
this is, if what you were doing, if the tactical engagement you're in supports the big picture

933
01:35:46.24 --> 01:35:53.12
strategy, it's not tactical, it's strategic. And if it doesn't, it's tactical and you're engaged,

934
01:35:53.12 --> 01:35:58.24
you shouldn't be doing it. Like how often do we dig in on these these small things that even

935
01:35:58.24 --> 01:36:04.48
then the end, if we win, don't reinforce the big picture goal, the objective. And how often do I

936
01:36:04.48 --> 01:36:09.04
on with my team, the marketing team dig in on how I want to do this, this thing and I'm going to fight

937
01:36:09.04 --> 01:36:15.44
with the, the sales team over resources and supplies and equipment and priority that don't actually

938
01:36:15.44 --> 01:36:20.88
help the company, the company achieve some sort of success. I'm being able to look at that as a

939
01:36:20.88 --> 01:36:28.000
leader and go and, A, A, listen, this doesn't matter. This, we don't need to dig in here, let them

940
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.64
have this, we're playing the longer game here because what we want is the company to win. And how

941
01:36:32.64 --> 01:36:39.20
hard it is for us to decouple this idea that every battle is a strategic, it's not very few of

942
01:36:39.20 --> 01:36:49.68
my career. Absolutely. For the role of grand strategy, higher strategy is to coordinate and

943
01:36:49.68 --> 01:36:54.40
direct all the resources of a nation or band of nations towards the attainment of a political

944
01:36:54.40 --> 01:37:00.24
object of the war, the goal defined by fundamental policy. Grand strategies should both

945
01:37:00.24 --> 01:37:06.64
calculate and develop to economic resources and manpower of nations in order to sustain fighting

946
01:37:06.64 --> 01:37:15.20
services also the moral resources. For the foster, the people's willing spirit is often as important

947
01:37:15.20 --> 01:37:20.48
as to possess more concrete forms of power, which is why you need to pay attention to what's going

948
01:37:20.48 --> 01:37:25.04
on in your country when it comes to propaganda that's being used against you. Grand strategy

949
01:37:25.04 --> 01:37:31.44
too should regulate the distribution of power between the several services and between the services

950
01:37:31.44 --> 01:37:39.12
and industry. Moreover, fighting power is but one of the instruments of grand strategy, which

951
01:37:39.12 --> 01:37:46.96
should take account of and apply the power of financial pressure, diplomatic pressure, commercial

952
01:37:46.96 --> 01:37:56.64
pressure and least of ethical pressure to weaken the opponent's will. A good cause is a sword as

953
01:37:56.64 --> 01:38:06.08
well as armor. Likewise, shivalry in war can be a most effective weapon in weakening the opponent's

954
01:38:06.08 --> 01:38:13.36
will to resist as well as augmenting moral strength. This is why we always say take the high ground

955
01:38:13.36 --> 01:38:19.20
of the high ground. Take the high ground of the good causes as a sword as well as armor.

956
01:38:22.16 --> 01:38:28.000
When you give up the high ground, when you get down into the mud and I think there's a quote,

957
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.56
you references when you get down into the mud, you're not getting muddy because somebody's

958
01:38:32.56 --> 01:38:37.20
throwing mud at you is because you went down there and how hard it is once you've got up the

959
01:38:37.20 --> 01:38:47.20
high ground to get back up onto the high ground. When you give that up, back to the book further

960
01:38:47.20 --> 01:38:54.56
more while the horizon of strategy is bounded by the war. Grand strategy looks beyond the war

961
01:38:54.56 --> 01:39:00.08
to the subsequent peace. It should not only combine the various instruments but so regulate their

962
01:39:00.08 --> 01:39:05.68
use as to avoid damage to the future state of peace for its security and prosperity. The

963
01:39:05.68 --> 01:39:10.32
sorry state of peace for both sides that is followed most wars can be traced to the fact that

964
01:39:10.32 --> 01:39:17.12
unlike strategy, the realm of grand strategy is for the most part Terra in Kognita.

965
01:39:18.56 --> 01:39:23.36
Still awaiting exploration and understanding that means unknown territory. So this is

966
01:39:24.24 --> 01:39:30.000
this is beyond thinking strategic and it's kind of the way we turn thinking strategic you know

967
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.92
if you and I have a relationship and I'm going to bark in order you where does that get me?

968
01:39:33.92 --> 01:39:38.32
Even if you do that thing where does it put us in the future? How is our relationship?

969
01:39:39.36 --> 01:39:43.92
If we have a client and we decide you know what we're going to bill them anyways even though they

970
01:39:43.92 --> 01:39:47.76
didn't you know they didn't participate but we're going to bill them anyways. How's that

971
01:39:47.76 --> 01:39:52.000
gonna work out for us to cool? We get a little bit more money right now. How does that how does that

972
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:59.84
affect us in a year when that client needs help? So the grand strategy looks beyond the war to

973
01:39:59.84 --> 01:40:05.76
subsequent peace. How often are we doing that? Looking further in the future.

974
01:40:09.44 --> 01:40:16.000
Goes into pure or military strategy. Having cleared the ground we can build up our conception

975
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:23.36
of strategy on its proper plane and original basis that of the art of the general. Strategy depends

976
01:40:23.36 --> 01:40:29.04
for success first and foremost, first and foremost, first sorry first and most on a sound

977
01:40:29.04 --> 01:40:38.000
calculation and coordination of the ends and means of the end and means. The end must be

978
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.08
proportioned to the total means and the means used in gaining each intermediate end which

979
01:40:44.08 --> 01:40:50.40
contributes to the ultimate must be proportioned to the value and the needs of that intermediate

980
01:40:50.40 --> 01:41:01.76
end whether it be to gain an objective or fulfill a contributory purpose and excess may be as harmful

981
01:41:01.76 --> 01:41:08.16
as a deficiency. So that's first of all that's a freaking run on sentence but what's the second

982
01:41:08.16 --> 01:41:14.16
fall? But second of all it's important because what he's saying is you should constantly be assessing

983
01:41:14.16 --> 01:41:18.88
if if the juice is worked the squeeze you should constantly be saying like listen we're going to

984
01:41:18.88 --> 01:41:22.48
put this much effort towards this client or going to put this much effort towards this relationship

985
01:41:22.48 --> 01:41:27.20
we're going to put this much effort towards this team who's we don't know how they're going to do

986
01:41:27.20 --> 01:41:34.24
so you constantly have to check yourself if the end that you're going towards is your investment

987
01:41:34.24 --> 01:41:41.52
worth it. What's the ROI? And by the way spending too much it can be as bad as not spending enough

988
01:41:41.52 --> 01:41:48.32
totally and and spending a much to to win a particular battle or win a particular war but you

989
01:41:48.32 --> 01:41:54.000
spent so much that you look around and go well that was not the juice wasn't worth the squeeze

990
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.60
wasn't worth the candle yeah what are we accomplished and that that next level up to grand strategy

991
01:42:00.16 --> 01:42:04.08
and of course I think the connection he's making is on this large scale man I literally took a

992
01:42:04.08 --> 01:42:11.04
class called American grand strategy and the military is a is a component of all these other

993
01:42:11.04 --> 01:42:14.96
things you named a bunch of them diplomatic you know uh uh uh eacon obviously it's a whole bunch of

994
01:42:14.96 --> 01:42:18.72
different tools that are inside there that are actually you know they're all connected but the

995
01:42:18.72 --> 01:42:23.20
military is one arm of that one of many of course you're in uniform you think the whole world

996
01:42:23.20 --> 01:42:28.24
of all's round military power we know we say it all the time we know that's not true but an example

997
01:42:28.24 --> 01:42:34.40
that you use we all the time and in just trying to explain this idea of utilizing resources and

998
01:42:34.40 --> 01:42:39.44
making decisions when you talk about means our means everybody has limited means we don't have

999
01:42:39.44 --> 01:42:44.80
unlimited means or unlimited resources and if I'm looking at this particular area that

1000
01:42:44.80 --> 01:42:48.88
I want to open up a shop here open up a couple of locations and this physical you know this

1001
01:42:48.88 --> 01:42:55.12
geographic area to compete with our uh competitors and I take all of my resources every penny I've

1002
01:42:55.12 --> 01:43:01.28
got every tool I've got and I get in there co-baker go home that's right and in the end we get in there

1003
01:43:01.28 --> 01:43:05.52
we get in that region and I don't know it doesn't quite work out or even if it does but we now have

1004
01:43:05.52 --> 01:43:12.72
no other tools and resources do anything else the larger piece that is the strategy isn't to get

1005
01:43:12.72 --> 01:43:19.04
into that area the strategy is actually to make our company stronger and that limited understanding

1006
01:43:19.04 --> 01:43:23.84
or that understanding being limited of hey we're here to take over this region if that is not

1007
01:43:23.84 --> 01:43:29.28
connected to the company being successful that larger piece of it all the all the means are all the

1008
01:43:29.28 --> 01:43:35.36
resources to getting into that area they don't help you. It's a waste you burn that candle yeah

1009
01:43:35.36 --> 01:43:41.44
yeah and you know what's interesting is from a leadership this is a total this is a leadership

1010
01:43:41.44 --> 01:43:48.16
capital discussion right it's hey is it worth me expanding this leadership capital on getting

1011
01:43:48.16 --> 01:43:54.16
gave to follow my order on getting gave to you know pick up a client that I know is going to be

1012
01:43:54.16 --> 01:43:59.76
painful and I'm forcing them to do it and whatever whatever the case may be is it worth that leadership

1013
01:43:59.76 --> 01:44:04.88
capital we we have to weigh that out and you know when you were talking about oh we got the the

1014
01:44:04.88 --> 01:44:10.88
diplomatic we got the the commercial pressure the financial pressure the ethical pressure all those

1015
01:44:10.88 --> 01:44:17.60
things and the military's part of that guess what in from a leadership perspective the military

1016
01:44:17.60 --> 01:44:21.28
thing is hey this is my rank I outrank you and we're just going to go by force that's what

1017
01:44:21.28 --> 01:44:25.84
course that should be there's six seven eight twelve other components that I can utilize as a

1018
01:44:25.84 --> 01:44:30.64
leader to make something happen and the worst one to use the one that cost me the most leadership

1019
01:44:30.64 --> 01:44:35.60
capital is the military one which is my rank which is hey on the boss you should you listen to me

1020
01:44:35.60 --> 01:44:42.24
to to compel someone through the threat of force as you're only tool to get them to comply the

1021
01:44:42.24 --> 01:44:49.12
threat of force and even you know the the the moral high ground I mean how convenient would it be

1022
01:44:49.12 --> 01:44:53.36
if you and I are in a situation looking at something and mine was the moral approach and yours

1023
01:44:53.36 --> 01:44:59.20
is the immoral approach which requires no money no time no resources no equipment to go oh you know

1024
01:44:59.20 --> 01:45:04.56
I hey listen if we do this we take the if we take the unethical and we get found out and

1025
01:45:04.56 --> 01:45:10.08
someone just goes oh hey man you're right you know you look listen man I was you're right we

1026
01:45:10.08 --> 01:45:16.16
we need to do just we just need to do the right thing here the the the strategic win from that alone

1027
01:45:17.20 --> 01:45:24.56
or the obstinate of the spectrum the military end is I come I threw force and demand and through

1028
01:45:24.56 --> 01:45:31.12
risk of of destruction yeah is how I'm getting you to to behave in a way that helps the team yeah

1029
01:45:31.12 --> 01:45:35.12
I've got this quote later on and I don't even remember where I got the quote from but I talked

1030
01:45:35.12 --> 01:45:39.76
about on this podcast maybe I talked about it in your phone line it's it's something along

1031
01:45:39.76 --> 01:45:45.12
the lines of cool you win and now you're in charge of a wasteland great oh yeah you won the

1032
01:45:45.12 --> 01:45:51.68
war cold now you have burnt scorched earth that's what you have cool good job what did you win nothing

1033
01:45:51.68 --> 01:46:00.48
yeah back to the book a true all this is a true adjustment would establish a perfect economy of force

1034
01:46:01.52 --> 01:46:07.60
in the deeper sense of that off distorted military term so all the time we heard the term you know

1035
01:46:07.60 --> 01:46:14.56
economy of force but because of the nature and uncertainty of war and uncertainty increased by

1036
01:46:14.56 --> 01:46:20.40
lack of scientific study even the greatest military ability could not achieve a true adjustment

1037
01:46:20.40 --> 01:46:26.64
and success lies in the closest approximation to the truth again his use the word truth is a little

1038
01:46:26.64 --> 01:46:31.68
bit is a little bit broad but what he's talking about is like how much should I apply to this how

1039
01:46:31.68 --> 01:46:35.84
much force should I apply we want to apply the minimum force required but we're not going to be

1040
01:46:35.84 --> 01:46:42.96
perfect with that so we want to get his closest we can this relativity is inherent because however

1041
01:46:42.96 --> 01:46:48.56
our knowledge and of the science of war be extended it will depend on the art for its application

1042
01:46:48.56 --> 01:46:54.96
art cannot only bring the end near to the means but by giving a higher value to the means and

1043
01:46:54.96 --> 01:47:03.60
enable the end to be extended this complicates calculation because no man can exactly calculate the

1044
01:47:03.60 --> 01:47:12.000
capacity of human genius and stupidity nor the incapacity of will so there's all these things

1045
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:18.24
that we have to account for as leaders you know and we're and we're not going to get it perfectly right

1046
01:47:18.96 --> 01:47:26.80
but how close can we get it? Next section elements and conditions in strategy however

1047
01:47:26.80 --> 01:47:33.68
calculation is simpler and a closer approximation to truth possible than in tactics so this is a very

1048
01:47:33.68 --> 01:47:39.84
interesting point it's easier to calculate big broad strategic things because you're a little bit

1049
01:47:39.84 --> 01:47:47.60
further away from the human component for an war the chief and calculs is human will which

1050
01:47:47.60 --> 01:47:52.88
manifests itself in resistance which in turn lies in the province of tactics strategy has not to

1051
01:47:52.88 --> 01:47:58.24
overcome resistance except from nature its purposes to diminish the possibility of resistance

1052
01:47:58.24 --> 01:48:03.76
and it seeks to fulfill this purpose by exploiting the elements of movement and surprise

1053
01:48:03.76 --> 01:48:10.40
now that's cool and everything I would say that there's definitely that's a stretch because we've seen

1054
01:48:11.12 --> 01:48:19.76
collect the collective will of a people change the outcome of strategic situations for sure

1055
01:48:20.56 --> 01:48:27.36
so even though I said hey it's it's closer to it still can have a huge impact I mean

1056
01:48:27.36 --> 01:48:33.12
look at Vietnam it was like oh well we can beat them because we can kill 150 Vietnamese soldiers

1057
01:48:33.12 --> 01:48:37.20
and via Kong soldiers for every one of our people that killed so well win no actually we won't win

1058
01:48:37.76 --> 01:48:44.56
because guess what the act their collective will is freaking incredibly strong yeah

1059
01:48:46.80 --> 01:48:53.44
but movement and surprise movement lies in the physical sphere and depends on calculation

1060
01:48:53.44 --> 01:48:58.08
of the conditions of the time topography and transport capacity by transport capacities meant both

1061
01:48:58.08 --> 01:49:03.12
of both the means by which and the measure in which force can be moved to maintain okay so there's

1062
01:49:03.12 --> 01:49:10.24
the physical sphere sphere of movement surprise lies in the psychological sphere and depends on

1063
01:49:10.24 --> 01:49:15.92
a calculation of far more difficult than in the physical sphere of the manifold conditions varying

1064
01:49:15.92 --> 01:49:22.16
in each case which are likely to affect the will of the opponent so you got two things you've

1065
01:49:22.16 --> 01:49:26.72
got movement and you've got surprise this is how we're gonna kind of win this is how we're gonna

1066
01:49:26.72 --> 01:49:32.96
win by movement and surprise movement physical surprise psychological although strategy may

1067
01:49:32.96 --> 01:49:40.32
a more at exploiting movement than at exploiting surprise or conversely the two elements react

1068
01:49:40.32 --> 01:49:46.24
on each other so even though they're different spheres they're still closely woven together

1069
01:49:47.28 --> 01:49:53.52
movement generates surprise and surprise gives impetus to movement so this is jujitsu right if you

1070
01:49:53.52 --> 01:49:58.08
surprise somebody they have to react to it so you can make someone move by surprising them with

1071
01:49:58.08 --> 01:50:03.92
something for a movement which is accelerated or changes its direction inevitably carries with it

1072
01:50:03.92 --> 01:50:10.16
a degree of surprise even though it be concealed while surprise smooths the path of movement

1073
01:50:10.16 --> 01:50:14.96
by hindering the enemies countermeasures and counter movements so if I surprise you don't

1074
01:50:14.96 --> 01:50:24.08
on time to react to you're not defending it yeah this obviously not something this guy was

1075
01:50:24.08 --> 01:50:29.28
thinking about when I think about flying and stealth airplanes the psychology of that is

1076
01:50:29.28 --> 01:50:34.32
what I what I have discovered and it's true not just an airplane and true in every situation

1077
01:50:34.32 --> 01:50:39.04
more often than not people's reaction to being surprised is not the right reaction they don't

1078
01:50:39.04 --> 01:50:42.88
usually react well even when they react it's still like an overreaction under reaction

1079
01:50:42.88 --> 01:50:49.44
think about how you react it when you're surprised are those usually like good smooth effective

1080
01:50:49.44 --> 01:50:58.000
responses 100% yeah all the time and when when you look at stealth airplanes the advent of

1081
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.68
Americans showing up with stealth airplanes and and sort of the culminating event really was in

1082
01:51:01.68 --> 01:51:06.32
desert storm when nobody even knew we had them and all of a sudden stealth airplanes are over

1083
01:51:06.32 --> 01:51:12.08
bad dad dropping bombs and the Iraqis didn't under they did not understand what was happening

1084
01:51:12.08 --> 01:51:17.60
and the reaction was obviously wrong now you know that they're proliferated that's why

1085
01:51:17.60 --> 01:51:22.16
an un a significantly undersized force when you're flying around the stealth aircraft

1086
01:51:22.16 --> 01:51:25.68
and then I'm fighting against you and your conventional aircraft and the first call you here

1087
01:51:25.68 --> 01:51:31.92
is hey the the first four of your airplanes are all dead and and the psychological response to that

1088
01:51:32.88 --> 01:51:36.80
is almost always the wrong response the reaction they they behave eratically they move

1089
01:51:36.80 --> 01:51:40.96
and different right they they don't know what to do the psychological response to surprise is

1090
01:51:40.96 --> 01:51:49.52
almost always the wrong reaction and the power of creating that reaction your opponents is really

1091
01:51:49.52 --> 01:51:53.28
hard to overstate and that's really one of the things that stealth airplanes have allowed us to do

1092
01:51:53.28 --> 01:51:59.04
is get our opponents to behave incorrectly to give us an even more of an advantage you're going to

1093
01:51:59.04 --> 01:52:03.52
off balance them somehow because what you just said when you say they either overreactor under

1094
01:52:03.52 --> 01:52:08.08
react guess what you either you're off balance right a balanced measured response would be like

1095
01:52:08.08 --> 01:52:12.08
okay we didn't really get them off balance but you either overreactor you under react

1096
01:52:12.08 --> 01:52:16.64
and through surprise you cause them to move to far in one direction too far in the other

1097
01:52:16.64 --> 01:52:19.60
direction that's what's going to happen and that's what we're going to take advantage of and you've

1098
01:52:19.60 --> 01:52:26.96
explained this a ton like if I attack your arm and you under react to a point where you do not

1099
01:52:26.96 --> 01:52:31.60
almost don't react at all and you just let me have it then I may actually culminate with an arm bar

1100
01:52:32.48 --> 01:52:36.40
but more than likely you're going to overreact and I want you to overreact in it so I can attack

1101
01:52:36.40 --> 01:52:41.04
something else but it's like you said it's it's the lack of a balance response it's usually an

1102
01:52:41.04 --> 01:52:46.48
overreaction usually that reveals a weakness somewhere else that I can then explain you know

1103
01:52:49.12 --> 01:52:56.56
as regards the relation of strategy attacks while in execution the border line is often shadowy

1104
01:52:56.56 --> 01:53:01.76
and it is difficult to decide exactly where a strategic movement ends and a tactical movement begins

1105
01:53:01.76 --> 01:53:09.36
yet in conception the two are distinct tactics lies in the fills tactics lies and fills the

1106
01:53:09.36 --> 01:53:16.24
province of fighting strategy not only stops on the frontier but has for its purpose the reduction of

1107
01:53:16.24 --> 01:53:24.08
fighting by the slendorist possible proportions so the purpose of strategies to not fight

1108
01:53:24.08 --> 01:53:33.28
because on with the aim of strategy this statement may be disputed by those who conceive

1109
01:53:33.28 --> 01:53:39.36
the destruction of the enemies armed force as the only sound aim in war who hold that the only

1110
01:53:39.36 --> 01:53:45.92
goal of strategy is battle and who obsessed with the clouds vizzi and saying that blood is the

1111
01:53:45.92 --> 01:53:52.24
price of victory yet if one should concede this point and meet its advocates on their own ground

1112
01:53:52.24 --> 01:53:58.88
the statement would remain unshaken for even if decisive battle be the goal the aim of strategy

1113
01:53:58.88 --> 01:54:04.88
must be to bring about this battle under the most advantageous circumstances and the more

1114
01:54:04.88 --> 01:54:10.48
advantageous the circumstances the less proportionally will be the fighting so whole goal of strategies

1115
01:54:10.48 --> 01:54:16.56
we're not fighting that's what we're doing the perfection of strategy would be therefore to produce a

1116
01:54:16.56 --> 01:54:22.72
decision without any serious fighting history now think about that from a leadership perspective

1117
01:54:23.60 --> 01:54:28.72
I never get an argument because Dave's doing what I need him to do to make it happen

1118
01:54:30.40 --> 01:54:36.08
that's the most effective strategy it's not how do I outwit David and argument that doesn't matter

1119
01:54:36.08 --> 01:54:42.88
why am I having an argument history as we have seen provides examples where strategy help by

1120
01:54:42.88 --> 01:54:48.40
favorable conditions has virtually produced such a result and he goes through some examples here

1121
01:54:50.24 --> 01:54:55.20
and again he's recalling back to some of the examples that he talks about in the book

1122
01:54:56.72 --> 01:55:01.68
while these cases where the destruction of the enemy's forces the enemies armed forces

1123
01:55:01.68 --> 01:55:09.20
was economically achieved through the disarming by surrender such destruction may not be essential

1124
01:55:09.20 --> 01:55:14.96
for a decision and for the fulfillment of the war aim in the case of a state that is seeking

1125
01:55:14.96 --> 01:55:21.76
not conquest but maintenance of its security the aim is fulfilled if the threat be removed

1126
01:55:21.76 --> 01:55:29.04
if the enemy is led to abandon his purpose with such while such blood this victories have been exceptional

1127
01:55:30.72 --> 01:55:34.48
their rarity enhances rather than detracts from their value

1128
01:55:34.48 --> 01:55:42.48
as an indication of latent potentialities in strategy and grand strategy despite many

1129
01:55:42.48 --> 01:55:49.92
centuries of experience of war we have hardly begun to explore the field of psychological warfare

1130
01:55:49.92 --> 01:55:56.64
from deep study of war clouse fits was led to the conclusion that quote all military action is

1131
01:55:56.64 --> 01:55:59.76
permeated by intelligent forces and their effects

1132
01:55:59.76 --> 01:56:06.88
nevertheless and quote nevertheless nations at war have always driven or been driven by their

1133
01:56:06.88 --> 01:56:12.80
passions to disregard the implications of such a conclusion instead of applying intelligence they

1134
01:56:12.80 --> 01:56:19.76
have chosen to batter their heads against the nearest wall so here's Karlswick's okay it's

1135
01:56:19.76 --> 01:56:28.64
it's an intelligence you know what doing but all the time we countries people leaders teams

1136
01:56:28.64 --> 01:56:32.80
we get we do stupid things we bang our head against the nearest wall because we get emotional

1137
01:56:32.80 --> 01:56:35.84
we're not intelligent and we gotta look out for that

1138
01:56:40.56 --> 01:56:44.24
it rests normally with the government responsible for the grand strategy of awarded decide

1139
01:56:44.24 --> 01:56:49.04
whether strategy should make its contribution by achieving a military decision or otherwise

1140
01:56:49.68 --> 01:56:55.20
just as military means is only one of the means to the end of grand strategy one of the instruments

1141
01:56:55.20 --> 01:57:01.76
in the surgeon's case so battle is only one of the means to the end of strategy

1142
01:57:03.36 --> 01:57:08.56
if the conditions are suitable it usually it is usually the quickest and effect

1143
01:57:08.56 --> 01:57:12.24
but if conditions are unfavorable it's a folly to use so cool you can go to battle

1144
01:57:12.96 --> 01:57:16.64
but if you haven't prepared for it and you don't have the advantage it's stupid

1145
01:57:18.64 --> 01:57:23.76
let's assume that a strategist is empowered to seek a military decision his responsibility is to

1146
01:57:23.76 --> 01:57:28.80
seek it under the most advantageous circumstances in order to produce the most profitable result

1147
01:57:29.28 --> 01:57:36.40
hence his true aim is not so much to seek battle as to seek a strategic situation so

1148
01:57:36.40 --> 01:57:43.68
advantageous that if it does not of itself produce the decision its continuation by battle is sure to

1149
01:57:43.68 --> 01:57:50.88
achieve this so we're not engaging in battles that we don't know we're gonna win and if we

1150
01:57:50.88 --> 01:57:54.80
know we're gonna win them why can't we convince them opponent that we're gonna win and they

1151
01:57:54.80 --> 01:58:02.40
bow down in other words dislocation is the aim of strategy it's sequel maybe either the

1152
01:58:02.40 --> 01:58:10.88
enemy's dissolution or his easier disruption in battle dissolution may involve some

1153
01:58:10.88 --> 01:58:16.88
partial measure of fighting but this is not but this is not the character of battle so that's

1154
01:58:16.88 --> 01:58:21.68
what we're trying to do we're trying to win the fight without fighting we're trying to win the

1155
01:58:21.68 --> 01:58:25.84
argument without having it I'm trying to get Dave what I to do what I wanted to do without

1156
01:58:25.84 --> 01:58:32.000
him even knowing that that's what I want to do it's with his idea yeah and think about that statement

1157
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:38.000
about you getting me to do do it do it you want me to get done without fighting with me

1158
01:58:38.88 --> 01:58:44.08
and take a step away from this book which is talking about fighting your enemies like your

1159
01:58:44.08 --> 01:58:52.80
literal enemies to someone on your team my team my guy yeah because the human nature doesn't

1160
01:58:52.80 --> 01:58:58.72
change it doesn't change if we're in the jungle desert if we're in if there's an old 42 if we're

1161
01:58:58.72 --> 01:59:05.84
in 1916 if we're in 1942 it doesn't matter if you're my enemy or you're my friend if there's

1162
01:59:05.84 --> 01:59:15.28
a component of human will then we need to utilize these principles effectively.

1163
01:59:15.92 --> 01:59:20.24
Next section action of strategy how is the strategic dislocation produced

1164
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:27.60
in the physical or logistical sphere it is the result of a move which a upsets the enemies

1165
01:59:27.60 --> 01:59:31.44
dispositions and by compelling a sudden change of front dislocates the distribution and

1166
01:59:31.44 --> 01:59:39.20
organization of his forces be separates his forces kind of got a little little little little

1167
01:59:39.20 --> 01:59:43.04
tingle in my spine when I saw that and dangers his supplies

1168
01:59:44.08 --> 01:59:51.44
de-menaces the root or roots by which he could retreat in case of need and reestablish himself on

1169
01:59:51.44 --> 01:59:55.52
the base so this there's these ways that we can cause strategic dislocation

1170
01:59:55.52 --> 02:00:02.88
a dislocation may be produced by one of these effects but is more often a consequence of several

1171
02:00:02.88 --> 02:00:05.76
right we're going to we're going to dislocate them from multiple different directions

1172
02:00:06.48 --> 02:00:12.96
differentiation indeed is difficult because a move directed toward the enemies rear tends to combine

1173
02:00:12.96 --> 02:00:18.24
these effects their respective influence however varies and has varied throughout history according

1174
02:00:18.24 --> 02:00:23.04
the size of armaged and complexities of their organization with armies which live on the country

1175
02:00:23.04 --> 02:00:28.32
drawing their supplies locally by plunder or requisition the line of communication has negligible

1176
02:00:28.32 --> 02:00:31.44
importance so if you got an army that's out there living off the land they kind of know what they're

1177
02:00:31.44 --> 02:00:35.52
doing you can't you can't really cut their supply lines because they don't have any

1178
02:00:36.56 --> 02:00:41.44
even if a higher even in a higher stage of military development the smaller a force the

1179
02:00:41.44 --> 02:00:46.48
less dependent it is on the lines of communication for supplies for larger an army and more

1180
02:00:46.48 --> 02:00:51.36
complex its organization the more prompt and serious in effect is a menace to its line of

1181
02:00:51.36 --> 02:00:54.40
communication so depending on who you're fighting you gotta make some adjustments

1182
02:00:55.52 --> 02:01:00.08
where armies have not been so dependent strategies been correspondingly handicapped and the

1183
02:01:00.08 --> 02:01:06.16
technically issue of battle has played a greater part nevertheless even thus handicapped able

1184
02:01:06.16 --> 02:01:12.32
strategists have frequently gained a decisive advantage previous to battle by menacing the

1185
02:01:12.32 --> 02:01:17.84
enemies lines of retreat the equilibrium of his dispositions or his local supplies so we're doing

1186
02:01:17.84 --> 02:01:22.16
so we're we're throwing people off the spy mess and we're just supply chain by messing with

1187
02:01:22.16 --> 02:01:27.84
their communication and by the way I'm probably gonna mention it's 15 15 thousand more times

1188
02:01:28.48 --> 02:01:36.24
he's talking all the time about disrupting your enemies communication each one of those is the red cell

1189
02:01:38.80 --> 02:01:46.16
the red team for us to go man am I communicating properly every time you hear that's one of the

1190
02:01:46.16 --> 02:01:53.60
main ways that the indirect approach works is by disrupting the enemy communication what is that

1191
02:01:53.60 --> 02:02:03.20
tell us about our communication it tells us it's freaking critical he goes into some some

1192
02:02:05.04 --> 02:02:11.84
talk about how to disrupt communication to be effective such a menace usually must be applied at

1193
02:02:11.84 --> 02:02:16.56
a point closer in time and space to the enemy's army than a menace to his communication

1194
02:02:17.60 --> 02:02:22.72
and thus early in warfare it's often difficult to distinguish between strategic and tactical maneuver

1195
02:02:23.36 --> 02:02:28.64
in the psychological sphere dislocation is the result of the impression on the commander's mind

1196
02:02:28.64 --> 02:02:35.36
of the physical effects which we have listed the impression is strongly accentuated if his realization

1197
02:02:35.36 --> 02:02:41.44
of being at a disadvantage is sudden and if he feels that he is unable to counter an enemy's move

1198
02:02:41.44 --> 02:02:46.72
psychological dislocation fundamentally springs from his sense of being trapped

1199
02:02:48.72 --> 02:02:57.44
that's straight out of like the jujitsu world and this is important so we feel

1200
02:02:58.40 --> 02:03:04.16
we feel dislocated we feel nervous when we get trapped guess what you should never do as a leader

1201
02:03:04.16 --> 02:03:10.64
hey Dave I know you want to do this but what if that happens why am I trapping him

1202
02:03:10.64 --> 02:03:16.000
why am I trapping you don't trap people that are on your team that's another little red cell

1203
02:03:17.12 --> 02:03:22.72
little red team if you're if I set you up to trap you you're gonna be uncomfortable you're gonna

1204
02:03:22.72 --> 02:03:28.80
get defensive you're gonna be unstable and my interest in interacting with you the next time

1205
02:03:28.80 --> 02:03:33.36
you know like oh here we go let's see what what jacco's gonna try to do to me this time

1206
02:03:34.24 --> 02:03:37.76
talking about loyalty and respect and the things that you actually want from me in the end

1207
02:03:37.76 --> 02:03:43.04
you know when when when you're the leader that likes to set your people up so you can hammer them

1208
02:03:45.28 --> 02:03:50.000
dude that's a classic like I won that argument cool and that argument man I don't have to

1209
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:55.04
even like a gypshoon that meeting good job he won't want to step up again

1210
02:03:55.04 --> 02:04:00.64
this is the reason why it is most frequently followed a physical move on the enemy's rear

1211
02:04:01.68 --> 02:04:07.12
an army like a man cannot properly defend its back from a blow without turning around to use

1212
02:04:07.12 --> 02:04:13.28
its arms in a new direction turning temporarily unbalances an army as it does a man and with the

1213
02:04:13.28 --> 02:04:18.08
former the period of instability is inevitably much longer in consequence the brain is much more

1214
02:04:18.08 --> 02:04:22.16
sensitive to any menace to its back this is why in jacco what are we trying to do we're trying

1215
02:04:22.16 --> 02:04:25.92
to attack the back that's why in the battlefield we're trying to we're trying to come around to the

1216
02:04:25.92 --> 02:04:34.08
rear because they have to maneuver and face you and they're exposed in contrast to move directly

1217
02:04:34.08 --> 02:04:40.64
on an opponent consolidates his balance physical and psychologically and by consolidating it

1218
02:04:40.64 --> 02:04:45.28
increases his resisting power when I attack you from the front you know exactly what's

1219
02:04:45.28 --> 02:04:53.44
that coming at you and you can resist it more what does that mean from the leadership perspective

1220
02:04:54.16 --> 02:05:02.72
that means that I I don't want to have you resist my ideas by coming right at you

1221
02:05:07.84 --> 02:05:13.28
for in the case of an army it rolls the enemy back towards the reserve supplies and reinforcement

1222
02:05:13.28 --> 02:05:16.64
so the original front is driven back and warn thin new layers are added to the back so

1223
02:05:16.64 --> 02:05:20.56
when you if you make the enemy retreat well guess what this is what the Russians did to Napoleon and to

1224
02:05:20.56 --> 02:05:25.92
the Nazis we're just gonna retreat yeah yeah you could job you beat us today cool we just got closer

1225
02:05:25.92 --> 02:05:31.36
to our supply chain yeah we just got more reinforcements our communication lines got got shorter

1226
02:05:32.40 --> 02:05:38.16
you made our job easier at the most it imposes a strain rather than producing a shock

1227
02:05:38.16 --> 02:05:44.64
thus a move around the enemy's rear against the move around the enemy's front against his rear

1228
02:05:44.64 --> 02:05:50.48
has the aim not only avoiding resistance on its way but in its issue in the profound

1229
02:05:50.48 --> 02:05:57.60
distance it takes the line of least resistance the equivalent in this psychological sphere is the

1230
02:05:57.60 --> 02:06:03.92
line of least expectation they are two faces of the same coin this is to widen our understanding of

1231
02:06:03.92 --> 02:06:09.12
strategy if we merely take what obviously appears the line of least resistance its obvious

1232
02:06:09.12 --> 02:06:14.16
ness will appeal to the opponent also and this line may no longer be the line of least resistance

1233
02:06:16.24 --> 02:06:20.96
used it when we used to go on weak hands reconnaissance missions and we'd get put on

1234
02:06:20.96 --> 02:06:24.88
reconnaissance missions like I camp penaltent and you get up to camp penaltent and you're

1235
02:06:24.88 --> 02:06:31.04
supposed to be observing some area and there's a one spot to observe there's like one bush

1236
02:06:31.04 --> 02:06:37.52
you're like we can it's so tempting to go to that bush we guess exactly where the they're

1237
02:06:37.52 --> 02:06:41.36
going to look they're going to look at that bush so you're better off digging a hole doing

1238
02:06:41.36 --> 02:06:46.80
whatever you got to do taking the worst looking bush you know there's four bushes three of them are

1239
02:06:46.80 --> 02:06:50.000
pretty good one of them socks go to the one that sucks

1240
02:06:54.88 --> 02:06:59.60
in studying the physical aspect we must never lose sight of those psychological and when both are

1241
02:06:59.60 --> 02:07:06.24
combined is the strategy truly an indirect approach calculated dislocate the opponent's balance

1242
02:07:07.44 --> 02:07:12.08
the mere action of marching indirectly toward the enemy and on the rear of his dispositions

1243
02:07:12.08 --> 02:07:16.32
is not constituted the strategic indirect approach so just because you try and come around the rear

1244
02:07:16.32 --> 02:07:20.48
doesn't mean because if that's what they think you're going to do it doesn't matter strategic

1245
02:07:20.48 --> 02:07:25.04
card is not so simple such an approach may start by being an indirect relation to an enemy's front

1246
02:07:25.04 --> 02:07:29.36
but by the very directness of its progress towards the rear may allow the enemy to change

1247
02:07:29.36 --> 02:07:33.36
his dispositions so that soon becomes a direct approach on a new front check

1248
02:07:36.40 --> 02:07:41.84
because of the risk that the enemy may achieve such a change of front it is usually necessary

1249
02:07:41.84 --> 02:07:50.88
for the dislocating move to be preceded by a move or moves which can best be defined as the term

1250
02:07:50.88 --> 02:07:57.20
distract in a literal sense to draw a sunder so we have to do multiple moves just like in

1251
02:07:57.20 --> 02:08:00.96
jujitsu you can't just do one move you can't recently you can't really even just do two you

1252
02:08:00.96 --> 02:08:06.88
got to do multiple moves to make the enemy not sure what's really important what's really going on

1253
02:08:06.88 --> 02:08:11.04
and you know I was I was doing a little bit of research because I always people will sometimes bring

1254
02:08:11.04 --> 02:08:20.32
up d day what about d day front all assault right yep yeah kind of guess what the deception

1255
02:08:20.32 --> 02:08:28.56
that the allied forces did to make Hitler and the Nazis unaware I think it was something like

1256
02:08:28.56 --> 02:08:34.56
I don't think Hitler committed all of his forces to Normandy for seven weeks because they were

1257
02:08:34.56 --> 02:08:39.36
expecting general patent that was the whole big scam like hey we got patent he's going to come in

1258
02:08:39.36 --> 02:08:46.80
this other spot and and so for seven weeks the Nazis were like no don't commit so even though it was

1259
02:08:46.80 --> 02:08:53.12
they looked like a direct assault there was a massive fake going on that that Germany didn't commit

1260
02:08:53.12 --> 02:09:00.16
their forces for seven weeks that's crazy so it looked like a frontal assault I get it but man

1261
02:09:00.16 --> 02:09:06.96
there was some distraction going on well just like he was he was just saying it's it's it's only

1262
02:09:06.96 --> 02:09:11.20
a frontal assault if the enemy recognizes this is a frontal assault and then lines up his defenses

1263
02:09:11.20 --> 02:09:17.44
against that frontal assault and the psychology of that the human nature reaction is the thing

1264
02:09:17.44 --> 02:09:23.04
that actually matters the most is your response to my interaction and if you think it's a frontal

1265
02:09:23.04 --> 02:09:28.56
assault they're going to react like it's a frontal assault and you're going to dig in and it was like

1266
02:09:28.56 --> 02:09:32.08
something's going something's going on here and like actually it's a frontal assault you don't know

1267
02:09:32.08 --> 02:09:36.32
it's a yeah it's a isn't a frontal assault it's a flank because they are putting their defenses elsewhere

1268
02:09:36.32 --> 02:09:42.88
yeah the purpose of this distraction is to deprive the enemy of his freedom of action and it should

1269
02:09:42.88 --> 02:09:47.60
operate both the physical and psychological fear spheres in the physical it should cause a

1270
02:09:47.60 --> 02:09:53.60
distension of his forces or their diversion to unprofit lens of that they are too widely distributed

1271
02:09:54.88 --> 02:10:00.48
and to commit it elsewhere who's exactly what D.A. was to have the power of interfering with one's

1272
02:10:00.48 --> 02:10:05.76
own decisively intended move which was we're going to hit it in the psychological fear sphere

1273
02:10:05.76 --> 02:10:11.20
the same effect is sought by playing upon the fears this the fears of and by deceiving the opposing

1274
02:10:11.20 --> 02:10:18.56
command stone wall jacks an athlete of expressed this in his strategic gomato mystify mislead and

1275
02:10:18.56 --> 02:10:24.72
surprise for to mystify and mislead constitutes distraction while surprise is the essential cause of

1276
02:10:24.72 --> 02:10:30.64
dislocation is through the distraction of the commander's mind that the distraction of his forces

1277
02:10:30.64 --> 02:10:37.12
follows the loss of his freedom of action is the sequel to the loss of his freedom of conception

1278
02:10:39.20 --> 02:10:44.000
a more profound appreciation of how the psychological permeates and dominates the physical

1279
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:51.20
fear sphere has an indirect value for it warns us of the fallacy and shallowness of attempting to

1280
02:10:51.20 --> 02:11:00.56
analyze and theorize about strategy in terms of mathematics to treat it quantitatively as if

1281
02:11:00.56 --> 02:11:07.76
the issue turned merely on superior concentration of force at a selected place is as faulty as

1282
02:11:07.76 --> 02:11:18.48
to treat it geometrically as a matter of lines and angles not just numbers even more remote from the

1283
02:11:18.48 --> 02:11:25.92
truth because in practice it usually leads to a dead end is the tendency of textbooks to treat war

1284
02:11:25.92 --> 02:11:32.24
as mainly a matter of concentrating superior force in his celebrated definition of economy of force

1285
02:11:32.96 --> 02:11:42.000
fock termed this the art of pouring out all one's resources at a given moment on one spot of making

1286
02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.40
use there of all truths and to make such a thing possible of making those troops permanently

1287
02:11:48.40 --> 02:11:54.16
communicate with each other instead of dividing them and attaching to each fraction some fixed

1288
02:11:54.16 --> 02:12:00.64
in invariable function its second part a result having been attained is the art of again so

1289
02:12:00.64 --> 02:12:06.48
disposing the troops as to converge upon and act against a single new objective and quote

1290
02:12:09.76 --> 02:12:15.12
it would have been so there's the there's the economy force like hey we're going to put all of our

1291
02:12:15.92 --> 02:12:21.12
forces in the right spot at the right time which we all know we learn that all the time and that's

1292
02:12:21.12 --> 02:12:26.08
part of prioritize an execute that is part of prioritize an execute is listen you got multiple things

1293
02:12:26.08 --> 02:12:34.88
you need to concentrate your forces on unobjective efficiently it would have been more exact and

1294
02:12:34.88 --> 02:12:41.44
he's kind of take upon a little a little hit on this quote from from fock who by the way this is

1295
02:12:41.44 --> 02:12:50.32
burden and a burden and fock this is the the French allied commander world war one so we kind of

1296
02:12:50.32 --> 02:12:56.72
already aren't super stoked on him because guess what he did he carried out his strategy

1297
02:12:56.72 --> 02:13:00.88
hey well gotta get more forces as we're gonna do concentrate all force will be blow that whistle

1298
02:13:00.88 --> 02:13:08.24
we're gonna break through this time no here's why it would have been more exact and more lucid to

1299
02:13:08.24 --> 02:13:15.84
say that an army should always be so distributed distributed that its parts can aid each other

1300
02:13:15.84 --> 02:13:23.36
and combine to produce the maximum possible concentration of force at one place while the minimum

1301
02:13:23.36 --> 02:13:30.40
force necessary is used elsewhere to prepare the success of the concentration this is what

1302
02:13:30.40 --> 02:13:37.44
cover movies this is what cover movies is you and and there's a doctrinal term and I used to tell

1303
02:13:37.44 --> 02:13:45.20
this the young seals is a doctrinal term called supporting distance and what supporting distance is you

1304
02:13:45.20 --> 02:13:50.56
Dave and me your platoon and my platoon or your company and my company or your battalion and my

1305
02:13:50.56 --> 02:13:55.92
battalion we aren't gonna get so far apart that we can't support each other so that means if

1306
02:13:55.92 --> 02:14:00.72
if we only have rifles we're gonna be 400 500 yards from each other you know depending on the

1307
02:14:00.72 --> 02:14:05.68
terrain if the terrain is you know mountainous or we might be closer than that because I want to

1308
02:14:05.68 --> 02:14:10.56
be able to provide support to you if we have mortars cool now we can stretch it out a little bit more

1309
02:14:10.56 --> 02:14:15.12
if we have our teller we can stretch it out even more but we need to be able to

1310
02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:22.16
cover and move for each other we need to be able to support each other and if we get too far apart

1311
02:14:22.64 --> 02:14:27.84
you're alone man we had a term that we got to coin it was called fluid mutual support

1312
02:14:28.72 --> 02:14:33.04
which is we when you say we got to coin this expand bro it's so this is when you can

1313
02:14:33.04 --> 02:14:38.64
good deal Dave well over here making stuff up listen well listen when we at Top Guns

1314
02:14:38.64 --> 02:14:45.84
figured out like we used to have just superior equipment superior technology better machines more

1315
02:14:45.84 --> 02:14:50.000
of them they worked better and we were fighting and I think I talked about this a while ago we were

1316
02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:55.76
firing and fighting an inferior opponent to be totally honest with you our tactics were kind of

1317
02:14:55.76 --> 02:14:59.76
straightforward they just wasn't that complicated and we didn't just like barge right in there and

1318
02:14:59.76 --> 02:15:04.16
fight them but you know our tactics relied on the fact that in the end our stuff was better than

1319
02:15:04.16 --> 02:15:09.12
your stuff and it's flown correctly well over time we couldn't rely on that anymore they're

1320
02:15:09.12 --> 02:15:12.32
equipment got better than ours they were able to do things we couldn't do and what we had to

1321
02:15:12.32 --> 02:15:17.12
start doing is taking that same equipment and start to utilize them differently and one of

1322
02:15:17.12 --> 02:15:20.88
things we had to get away from was cover move for airplanes used to be a thousand feet away

1323
02:15:21.44 --> 02:15:26.56
2000 feet away and you stay together I turn you turn you I go you go and your job is a wingman

1324
02:15:26.56 --> 02:15:31.44
and how I grated your performance as a wingman as how well you stayed inside that what we called

1325
02:15:31.44 --> 02:15:37.44
visual visual visual sports and if you lost sight of me believe me we you were going to hear about

1326
02:15:37.44 --> 02:15:47.68
in the debrief and what we evolved to was because of inferior equipment we had to actually get

1327
02:15:47.68 --> 02:15:54.32
farther away from each other so in simple as terms we could figure out who is the person who is

1328
02:15:54.32 --> 02:16:00.64
the aircraft in the formation that was fundamentally the most at risk or the most likely to be engaged

1329
02:16:00.64 --> 02:16:05.44
and the other aircraft could then flank or maneuver or come in from a different three-dimensional

1330
02:16:05.44 --> 02:16:13.12
direction to support that person and it was fluid because it changed it wasn't exactly on the 35 degree

1331
02:16:13.12 --> 02:16:19.68
bearing line at five miles it evolved based on weather based on weapons based in the formation

1332
02:16:19.68 --> 02:16:25.44
and just like you described it and I had to know and if I got too far away I couldn't support you and if I was too close to

1333
02:16:25.44 --> 02:16:31.28
you I couldn't maneuver in a way that allowed me to have an advantageous entry to the problem I flank

1334
02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:36.48
because I was too close to you and while you were talking about that I was just thinking of

1335
02:16:37.04 --> 02:16:43.28
the French approach to older one this culminating thing versus just the standard combined arms effect

1336
02:16:43.28 --> 02:16:46.88
oh cool I don't need a million tanks I got a couple tanks so you don't want to rock

1337
02:16:46.88 --> 02:16:49.36
to the tanks cool they're going to run you over you want to rock to the tanks cool come

1338
02:16:49.36 --> 02:16:51.60
out your holes we're going to get your their children you don't want to deal with their

1339
02:16:51.60 --> 02:16:55.52
artillery you're going to dig in cool I'll roll over the aircraft and I don't need an

1340
02:16:55.52 --> 02:17:01.44
overwhelming force of any of those three but I need them together in support of one another

1341
02:17:01.44 --> 02:17:04.72
and I don't know in the end who's going to get the kill or who's going to be the reason why I'm

1342
02:17:04.72 --> 02:17:09.20
successful but you're going to have to react to something and if you don't one of those different

1343
02:17:09.20 --> 02:17:13.52
arms those different supporting elements will eventually be the thing that causes you to lose

1344
02:17:13.52 --> 02:17:25.60
supporting distance covered move and and now fluid mutual support we better I'm going to do it

1345
02:17:25.60 --> 02:17:29.60
I should have known that I was going to totally submarine your goals of getting through this by

1346
02:17:29.60 --> 02:17:36.24
talking way too much I planned for this so we'll wrap it up with another paragraph and then we'll

1347
02:17:36.24 --> 02:17:43.12
we'll do the next on the next podcast here's where he's going to break down Fox statement a little

1348
02:17:43.12 --> 02:17:52.48
bit he says wind because Fox said the art of pouring all one's resources so so ladel hard says

1349
02:17:52.48 --> 02:17:58.80
the concentrate all is an unrealizable ideal and dangerous even as a hyperbole

1350
02:17:59.92 --> 02:18:06.56
moreover in practice the minimum necessary maybe a far larger portion of the total

1351
02:18:06.56 --> 02:18:11.44
than maximum possible they would even be true to say that the larger the force that is effectively

1352
02:18:11.44 --> 02:18:16.88
used for distraction of the enemy the greater the chance of the concentration succeeding in its aim

1353
02:18:18.16 --> 02:18:25.28
for otherwise it may strike an object to solid to be shattered this is like um

1354
02:18:26.56 --> 02:18:33.92
in jujitsu if you if I try and sweep you but it's I'm not really trying to sweep you you don't even

1355
02:18:33.92 --> 02:18:38.88
have to react to it I have to really try and sweep you then if I really try and sweep you then you

1356
02:18:38.88 --> 02:18:43.28
expose your neck boom cool you stick your neck out to you you know you push into me and boom there's

1357
02:18:43.28 --> 02:18:49.04
your neck I can get the guillotine if I don't actually put enough force to get but if I put too much

1358
02:18:49.04 --> 02:18:54.80
force into that well and you defend it well well now I've used a bunch of energy didn't work

1359
02:18:54.80 --> 02:19:00.32
and how often am I going to do that so we have to be careful and what he's saying is you want to

1360
02:19:00.32 --> 02:19:05.92
use it's what we talk a lot about a lot about edescalum front which is minimum force required

1361
02:19:05.92 --> 02:19:12.64
well like how much force do I need to use to get you to react and if if I only have to use you know

1362
02:19:12.64 --> 02:19:17.28
10% of my force over here to get you to react that means I have 90% of my force to finish

1363
02:19:17.28 --> 02:19:23.84
you finish the job on the flank closing this out superior weight at the intended decisive

1364
02:19:23.84 --> 02:19:29.28
point does not suffice unless that point cannot be reinforced in time by the opponent

1365
02:19:30.32 --> 02:19:34.16
yeah you can you can put a bunch I can go for your arm but if you're going to grab with your

1366
02:19:34.16 --> 02:19:39.60
other arm and defend it well it doesn't matter that I singled out your arm it rarely suffices

1367
02:19:39.60 --> 02:19:44.08
unless that point is not merely weaker numerically but has been weakened morally

1368
02:19:45.12 --> 02:19:51.20
Napoleon suffered some of his worst checks because he neglected this guarantee and the need for

1369
02:19:51.20 --> 02:20:01.36
distraction has grown with the delaying power of weapons so there you go that's a warm-up

1370
02:20:01.36 --> 02:20:07.04
with almost two and a half hours deep right now we're talking it's it's only going to get deeper from here

1371
02:20:08.80 --> 02:20:14.80
let's let's call it for right now let's get into some I don't know echo Charles maybe the

1372
02:20:15.68 --> 02:20:22.56
anything any closing statement safe all right let's let's roll into a little little quick activity with

1373
02:20:22.56 --> 02:20:29.84
you know maybe a little bit of support sure you know I know we're trying to be indirect but

1374
02:20:29.84 --> 02:20:35.36
maybe there's some direct ways we can kind of help ourselves out sure what you got or some help in our

1375
02:20:36.80 --> 02:20:43.68
on our path which includes being indirect as far as effectiveness goes concur yeah so let's talk

1376
02:20:43.68 --> 02:20:50.88
with our friend Kerry and you and I just kind of come to realize that this path is not that hard anymore

1377
02:20:51.52 --> 02:20:58.40
it's hard but it's not as hard you're taking my Vapath that we're all on and okay I didn't know that

1378
02:20:58.40 --> 02:21:02.96
this was like the path just got easy little bit easier okay more easier yeah easier it's not

1379
02:21:02.96 --> 02:21:09.12
easy all that's hard still but it's easier in this way juggle fuel boom this is why you drink

1380
02:21:09.12 --> 02:21:13.68
energy drinks that's no longer a problem if you're on the path and you're like into energy drinks

1381
02:21:13.68 --> 02:21:18.24
right get to get real those and sometimes it'll take will power understand you know at the very

1382
02:21:18.24 --> 02:21:23.20
least in adjustment period that might not be very comfortable yeah let's not like that anymore

1383
02:21:23.20 --> 02:21:29.60
and drink all energy drinks you on anymore just plain go and drink good for you boom path easier

1384
02:21:29.60 --> 02:21:34.72
yeah right that adjust I have to concur the path just got easier that goes with the correct

1385
02:21:34.72 --> 02:21:40.88
it's sure also we want to have dessert right yeah well if you're on the path what's

1386
02:21:40.88 --> 02:21:46.40
you gotta start excluding dessert from time to time in fact pretty much all the time on the path

1387
02:21:46.40 --> 02:21:54.16
yeah the occasional dessert can happen I mean yeah I mean my daughter's birthday yesterday

1388
02:21:54.16 --> 02:21:59.76
yes I understand oh but I was at Ragland which is kind of one of my go to

1389
02:21:59.76 --> 02:22:06.32
right it might be my favorite restaurant yeah and they have that that cast iron pan with the

1390
02:22:06.32 --> 02:22:12.32
talk it's yeah they call it the illegal yeah it's good they're like it's so good it should be illegal

1391
02:22:12.32 --> 02:22:18.80
yeah good name so we had to order some illegal from my daughter's birthday yeah it's a birthday

1392
02:22:18.80 --> 02:22:25.36
right did that illegal girl right so when it showed up the ice cream just melts in the pan

1393
02:22:25.36 --> 02:22:30.16
dude it's a whole no situation yeah I understand well let's face it to your point we can't be doing

1394
02:22:30.16 --> 02:22:36.16
that you know every day every day exactly we would probably not even more than once per month

1395
02:22:36.16 --> 02:22:41.04
what if you could though because you don't do it for the illegal necessarily most of us we do it

1396
02:22:41.04 --> 02:22:45.20
because hey that could that thing tastes good yeah you know let's face it yeah after dinner

1397
02:22:45.20 --> 02:22:49.04
Ragland I'm assuming you got some steak or something like this it's not like you're like starving

1398
02:22:49.04 --> 02:22:53.76
and hungry after the steak you just want some things yeah that's it's it's it's it's it's it's

1399
02:22:53.76 --> 02:22:58.40
sad so you get that so you get it you get the illegal you got the yours things sweet cool

1400
02:22:58.40 --> 02:23:04.000
but you pay a price yeah now on this new path we don't gotta pay the price look at that

1401
02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:11.44
easier do it every day let's talk about more I have to talk about that one of the

1402
02:23:11.44 --> 02:23:16.88
yes so and you get additional protein in the form of this dessert so boom right there path

1403
02:23:16.88 --> 02:23:22.72
little bit easier you see what I'm saying yeah um good news it also we got some other supporting

1404
02:23:22.72 --> 02:23:27.36
elements uh for your joints during our first super cruel oil that stuff before you immunity

1405
02:23:27.92 --> 02:23:32.16
well you know what you're saying right now is actually a pretty big deal like if you think about

1406
02:23:32.16 --> 02:23:37.76
if you think about the the fact that someone right now is like well they're drinking

1407
02:23:37.76 --> 02:23:43.52
three energy drinks a day yeah and it's not good for them and it is gonna have long term

1408
02:23:44.48 --> 02:23:49.12
negative health effects legitimate well they're doing it for a reason right they need the benefit

1409
02:23:49.12 --> 02:23:53.76
of the energy drink whatever that is but it's like that's not it's a problem it's a problem

1410
02:23:53.76 --> 02:23:58.56
and and all of a sudden like that like with a snap of the fingers you're you can actually

1411
02:23:58.56 --> 02:24:06.48
you can actually still get the benefits with no downside that's freaking crazy no problem yeah

1412
02:24:07.20 --> 02:24:12.40
yeah same thing with dessert all the benefits sweetness goodness filling

1413
02:24:14.72 --> 02:24:19.28
let's face it there's a certain texture too like that you kind of you know you want that mole

1414
02:24:19.28 --> 02:24:29.52
clear that's true but it's all true so you know does that go against the whole hayman

1415
02:24:29.52 --> 02:24:34.56
the path is hard embrace the hardness you look okay but the his his the dichotomy you

1416
02:24:34.56 --> 02:24:39.20
turn me on to this he can't have some big deal this is a big deal too look I think I thought

1417
02:24:39.20 --> 02:24:43.12
be a to the dell heart and some in for for today but apparently I got a job of coming

1418
02:24:43.12 --> 02:24:48.80
in I would the facts the truth I'm doing the best they can talk of here to benefit the group um you

1419
02:24:49.76 --> 02:24:55.52
look the goal isn't to drink milk that's not the goal it's a means to an end

1420
02:24:56.32 --> 02:25:02.72
I'm learning to check so the milk is the protein to help us recover from our workouts

1421
02:25:02.72 --> 02:25:09.36
all right same same yeah right so it's more efficient why should we fight that battle

1422
02:25:09.36 --> 02:25:15.12
we don't have to the same thing cool take them all no matter no fact yeah easy money boom

1423
02:25:15.12 --> 02:25:20.000
more efficient when without a fight when we're not choking down some crap yes some

1424
02:25:20.88 --> 02:25:26.80
chalky how much do you think forward to milk very much so I look I'm I get super

1425
02:25:26.80 --> 02:25:31.20
amped oh yeah and it's the kind and this is good not to hide a malk before we train

1426
02:25:32.64 --> 02:25:36.64
normally I don't do that but I don't know before we train today because I got done with the

1427
02:25:36.64 --> 02:25:41.92
EF online like what 12 30 and we weren't gonna train until 230 times like

1428
02:25:43.12 --> 02:25:47.12
because normally I don't eat until after the train but today

1429
02:25:48.72 --> 02:25:53.52
again it was calling you you know how certain desserts call your name that's what's happening

1430
02:25:53.52 --> 02:25:56.48
too yeah yeah I understand I just don't fully be guess what no problem

1431
02:25:56.48 --> 02:26:00.72
calling this path that we're on just got a little bit easier so you don't kind of worry about that anymore

1432
02:26:00.72 --> 02:26:06.08
check so yeah like I said we had got E-Munity stuff as well cold war uh vitamin D3 boom

1433
02:26:06.08 --> 02:26:10.40
take that all guarantee your path would be a little bit easier versus if you don't take

1434
02:26:10.40 --> 02:26:14.88
that we're not getting sick all of a sudden thank you which we like you can get this you

1435
02:26:14.88 --> 02:26:18.24
get the drinks at wall wall by the way on the east coast if you're on the east coast you're

1436
02:26:18.24 --> 02:26:22.48
gonna wall walk get yourself you can clear out shelves whatever that's kind of like what we're doing

1437
02:26:23.28 --> 02:26:30.56
sanction really sanctioned authorized yeah authorized cori my boy cori my cousin cori rolled in

1438
02:26:30.56 --> 02:26:36.64
with an actual cooler to a wall wall and just started clearing shelves straight up like what yeah

1439
02:26:36.64 --> 02:26:41.20
where's what we're doing where he's just looking at like this like oh yeah you need a wall

1440
02:26:41.20 --> 02:26:45.52
you need you can get this stuff at vitamin shop vitamin shop has the whole line of uh uh the

1441
02:26:45.52 --> 02:26:53.92
supplement so you can go to vitamin shop or you go to jockelfield.com and get some if you want some

1442
02:26:53.92 --> 02:27:01.04
yep and if you're interested in a little discount little free shipping little not having to worry

1443
02:27:01.04 --> 02:27:06.80
about remembering to make sure you're always stopped get the subscription path just got a little

1444
02:27:06.80 --> 02:27:11.04
leave your easier even if the path just got to leave an easier we're efficient remembering we're

1445
02:27:11.04 --> 02:27:15.36
not worried about it more efficient when how we can focus on something else you know no distraction

1446
02:27:16.08 --> 02:27:19.20
technically it's BH little delheart it would be like oh you got a distraction going on you

1447
02:27:19.20 --> 02:27:23.36

1555
02:38:04.64 --> 02:38:12.88

1558
02:38:25.84 --> 02:38:32.72
here at home and everyone else out there the direct approach is not as direct as you think

1559
02:38:33.76 --> 02:38:41.20
to think again and maybe maybe just try taking the long way around because the long way around

1560
02:38:41.20 --> 02:38:51.28
you might find out ends up being the shortest distance between two points until next time this is

1561

Dave and echo in juggle out
