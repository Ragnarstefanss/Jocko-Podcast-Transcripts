00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.48
This is Jocco podcast number 69.

2
00:00:04.48 --> 00:00:08.64
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

3
00:00:08.64 --> 00:00:10.24
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:10.24 --> 00:00:10.84
Good evening.

5
00:00:14.68 --> 00:00:17.92
The president of the United States takes pride

6
00:00:17.92 --> 00:00:19.76
in presenting the Medal of Honor,

7
00:00:19.76 --> 00:00:24.76
posthumously, to Captain Henry T. L. Rodd,

8
00:00:24.76 --> 00:00:27.48
United States Marine Corps.

9
00:00:27.48 --> 00:00:32.48
For service as set forth in the following citation.

10
00:00:32.48 --> 00:00:37.48
For conspicuous gallantry and intrapetity

11
00:00:37.48 --> 00:00:41.28
at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty

12
00:00:41.28 --> 00:00:45.56
while attached to Marine of fighting squadron 211

13
00:00:45.56 --> 00:00:49.60
during action against the Japanese land, surface,

14
00:00:49.60 --> 00:00:52.64
and early units at Wake Island.

15
00:00:52.64 --> 00:00:58.24
From 8 to 23 December 1941.

16
00:00:58.24 --> 00:01:02.52
Engaging vastly superior forces of enemy bombers

17
00:01:02.52 --> 00:01:05.52
and warships on 9 and 12 December,

18
00:01:05.52 --> 00:01:11.56
Captain L. Rodd shot down two of a flight of 22 hostile planes

19
00:01:11.56 --> 00:01:15.52
and executing repeated bombing and strafing runs

20
00:01:15.52 --> 00:01:18.32
at extremely low altitude and close range,

21
00:01:18.32 --> 00:01:20.96
succeeded in flicking deadly damage

22
00:01:20.96 --> 00:01:23.12
upon a large Japanese vessel

23
00:01:23.12 --> 00:01:25.60
thereby sinking the first major warship

24
00:01:25.60 --> 00:01:28.76
to be destroyed by small caliber bombs delivered

25
00:01:28.76 --> 00:01:30.92
from a fighter type aircraft.

26
00:01:32.44 --> 00:01:35.20
When his plane was disabled by hostile fire

27
00:01:35.20 --> 00:01:37.28
and no other ships were operative,

28
00:01:37.28 --> 00:01:41.84
Captain L. Rodd assumed command of one flank of the line,

29
00:01:41.84 --> 00:01:44.68
set up in defiance of the enemy landing

30
00:01:44.68 --> 00:01:47.16
and conducting a brilliant defense,

31
00:01:47.16 --> 00:01:49.52
enabled his men to hold their positions

32
00:01:49.52 --> 00:01:53.32
and repulse determined enemy attacks repeatedly,

33
00:01:53.32 --> 00:01:57.56
proceeding through intense hostile fuselage

34
00:01:57.56 --> 00:02:03.36
to provide covering fire for unarmed ammunition carriers.

35
00:02:04.80 --> 00:02:09.20
Capturing an automatic weapon during one enemy rushing force,

36
00:02:09.20 --> 00:02:11.24
he gave his own firearm to one of his men

37
00:02:11.24 --> 00:02:14.40
and fought on vigorously against the Japanese.

38
00:02:14.40 --> 00:02:19.40
Responsible in a large measure of the strength of his sectors,

39
00:02:20.40 --> 00:02:22.44
gallons resistance.

40
00:02:22.44 --> 00:02:26.24
On 23 December, Captain L. Rodd led his men

41
00:02:26.24 --> 00:02:31.24
with bold, aggressiveness until he fell, mortally wounded.

42
00:02:33.24 --> 00:02:37.92
His superb skill as a pilot, daring leadership,

43
00:02:37.92 --> 00:02:40.32
an unswerving devotion to duty

44
00:02:40.32 --> 00:02:44.12
to distinguish him among the defenders of Wakeland.

45
00:02:45.12 --> 00:02:48.36
And his valiant conduct reflects the highest credit

46
00:02:48.36 --> 00:02:53.36
upon himself and the United States Naval Service.

47
00:02:54.84 --> 00:02:58.24
He gallantly gave his life for his country.

48
00:03:01.04 --> 00:03:03.40
signed Harry S. Truman.

49
00:03:03.40 --> 00:03:08.40
And that is the Medal of Honor citation

50
00:03:11.32 --> 00:03:15.04
for Henry Talmage, L. Rodd, the first aviator

51
00:03:15.04 --> 00:03:17.76
in World War II to be awarded the Medal of Honor.

52
00:03:19.04 --> 00:03:21.96
In the first man to sink a warship from a fighter plane

53
00:03:24.28 --> 00:03:25.96
during the Battle of Wakeland.

54
00:03:25.96 --> 00:03:28.40
And if you don't know anything about the Battle of Wakeland,

55
00:03:28.40 --> 00:03:33.40
it began simultaneously with the attack on Pearl Harbor

56
00:03:33.56 --> 00:03:34.80
when that started.

57
00:03:34.80 --> 00:03:38.80
And it ended on 23 December 1941

58
00:03:39.92 --> 00:03:42.80
when American forces were forced to surrender.

59
00:03:45.20 --> 00:03:49.60
And that was, with around 500 American servicemen,

60
00:03:50.68 --> 00:03:54.72
and they had a handful of coastal artillery pieces

61
00:03:54.72 --> 00:03:57.56
and a handful of anti-aircraft guns,

62
00:03:57.56 --> 00:03:59.32
and they had 12 aircraft.

63
00:04:00.24 --> 00:04:05.000
And what they were facing was 2,500 Japanese infantry

64
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.36
supported by three light cruisers, eight destroyers,

65
00:04:09.36 --> 00:04:12.28
two patrol boats, two troop transports,

66
00:04:12.28 --> 00:04:14.88
two aircraft carriers with all their planes

67
00:04:14.88 --> 00:04:16.48
and two heavy cruisers.

68
00:04:18.56 --> 00:04:20.52
They were completely outnumbered

69
00:04:20.52 --> 00:04:23.24
and completely and utterly outgunned.

70
00:04:23.24 --> 00:04:27.16
But they held out for 15 days

71
00:04:27.16 --> 00:04:30.36
and while they were under that siege,

72
00:04:30.36 --> 00:04:33.52
on the 20th of December,

73
00:04:33.52 --> 00:04:37.72
while the Japanese were preparing for their final attack,

74
00:04:37.72 --> 00:04:44.72
major L-Rodd got out one last letter to his wife.

75
00:04:44.72 --> 00:04:49.72
And I'm gonna read that to you.

76
00:04:53.52 --> 00:04:56.84
Saturday, 20 December 1941,

77
00:04:56.84 --> 00:04:59.28
my dearest darling sweetheart.

78
00:05:01.68 --> 00:05:03.68
I never suspected this afternoon

79
00:05:03.68 --> 00:05:06.04
when I wrote my other short note

80
00:05:06.04 --> 00:05:08.36
that I would be sitting down writing another tonight.

81
00:05:09.44 --> 00:05:10.36
But here we are.

82
00:05:11.32 --> 00:05:13.24
I just got in a few minutes ago

83
00:05:13.24 --> 00:05:16.48
and have just learned that Walt Baylor is returning

84
00:05:16.48 --> 00:05:20.000
and he has kindly consented to deliver to this personally.

85
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.48
So I am very thankful for the moment.

86
00:05:24.12 --> 00:05:26.28
Of course, there isn't a lot of news

87
00:05:26.28 --> 00:05:27.44
that I can write about it.

88
00:05:28.44 --> 00:05:32.52
And you probably know more real news than I do anyhow.

89
00:05:34.16 --> 00:05:35.56
I am missing you terribly

90
00:05:35.56 --> 00:05:39.44
and I am undergoing a few new experiences

91
00:05:39.44 --> 00:05:42.72
but also is everyone else.

92
00:05:44.16 --> 00:05:46.000
We've had considerable rain today

93
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.48
and you're still cloudy.

94
00:05:48.64 --> 00:05:51.28
The wind has been very low, however.

95
00:05:52.64 --> 00:05:55.76
The weather on the whole is nothing to complain about.

96
00:05:57.20 --> 00:05:59.04
But I would like to see a good old fashioned,

97
00:05:59.04 --> 00:06:02.24
ties, food, sweep this entire area.

98
00:06:04.36 --> 00:06:06.44
I imagine there is an awful lot of white washing

99
00:06:06.44 --> 00:06:08.48
going on now in high places.

100
00:06:08.48 --> 00:06:10.88
It certainly will be a criminal shame

101
00:06:10.88 --> 00:06:14.08
if they succeed in covering over everything.

102
00:06:17.12 --> 00:06:19.80
I am writing this in something of a hurry

103
00:06:19.80 --> 00:06:22.84
and under somewhat difficult circumstances.

104
00:06:24.76 --> 00:06:26.08
I'll think of a million things

105
00:06:26.08 --> 00:06:29.32
that I should have said after I had gone to bed tonight.

106
00:06:31.68 --> 00:06:34.92
But now I'm going to say that I love you

107
00:06:34.92 --> 00:06:37.52
and you alone always and always

108
00:06:37.52 --> 00:06:40.000
and repeated a million times or so.

109
00:06:42.48 --> 00:06:44.48
Give my love to Mary also

110
00:06:45.84 --> 00:06:49.48
between the two of you, you have it all.

111
00:06:51.20 --> 00:06:53.04
There isn't any for anyone else.

112
00:06:56.72 --> 00:06:58.92
I know that you are praying for me

113
00:06:58.92 --> 00:07:01.16
and I have nothing more to ask

114
00:07:01.16 --> 00:07:02.92
than that your prayers be answered.

115
00:07:02.92 --> 00:07:07.92
You're as devotedly and loving,

116
00:07:10.44 --> 00:07:11.28
tell much.

117
00:07:24.68 --> 00:07:28.08
And so I think it's important that

118
00:07:29.60 --> 00:07:31.12
when you hear that letter,

119
00:07:31.12 --> 00:07:36.12
you recognize the fact that this is a man.

120
00:07:38.20 --> 00:07:40.96
And of course, we always remember

121
00:07:40.96 --> 00:07:45.96
that these men, we call them heroes,

122
00:07:49.80 --> 00:07:51.28
deserve it be so.

123
00:07:51.28 --> 00:07:53.68
We do that to honor them.

124
00:07:53.68 --> 00:07:57.68
But I think it's important to always remember

125
00:07:57.68 --> 00:08:00.64
that these heroes,

126
00:08:02.64 --> 00:08:06.84
their people, their people.

127
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And these men, these heroes, these Marines, these people

128
00:08:18.28 --> 00:08:19.72
that held the line.

129
00:08:21.52 --> 00:08:23.16
They held the line for 15 days

130
00:08:23.16 --> 00:08:25.000
before they were forced to surrender

131
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.76
after losing 49 Marines killed,

132
00:08:28.76 --> 00:08:32.76
two missing in action, three Navy personnel killed,

133
00:08:32.76 --> 00:08:34.92
70 US civilians killed.

134
00:08:34.92 --> 00:08:37.96
And by the way, the Japanese losses were recorded

135
00:08:37.96 --> 00:08:41.52
about 820 killed with over 300 wounded.

136
00:08:42.72 --> 00:08:44.96
Two destroyers lost

137
00:08:44.96 --> 00:08:51.96
and almost 30 Japanese aircraft shot down her damaged.

138
00:08:55.84 --> 00:09:00.84
But the odds and the ratio of force

139
00:09:03.92 --> 00:09:08.92
was just stacked against the US forces on Wake Island

140
00:09:08.92 --> 00:09:10.56
and when you get into a situation like that,

141
00:09:10.56 --> 00:09:14.56
a dire situation, violent situation,

142
00:09:14.56 --> 00:09:18.08
a situation where you are facing a determined enemy.

143
00:09:21.76 --> 00:09:26.76
There is a bond that forms between people.

144
00:09:28.88 --> 00:09:30.88
Regardless of where they're from

145
00:09:30.88 --> 00:09:32.52
or what their background is

146
00:09:32.52 --> 00:09:36.88
or what their socioeconomic class is

147
00:09:36.88 --> 00:09:38.24
or what service they were in,

148
00:09:38.24 --> 00:09:39.56
none of that matters.

149
00:09:39.56 --> 00:09:44.56
There's a bond that forms that cannot be broken.

150
00:09:52.52 --> 00:09:57.68
And we certainly had that in the Battle of Ramadi.

151
00:09:57.68 --> 00:10:03.68
The US Army soldiers, United States Marines,

152
00:10:03.68 --> 00:10:09.08
C.B.S.R. Seals of Task Unit,

153
00:10:09.08 --> 00:10:14.08
Bruser, all of us that were in that fight,

154
00:10:15.28 --> 00:10:16.84
had that bond.

155
00:10:22.44 --> 00:10:23.52
We were brothers.

156
00:10:27.56 --> 00:10:32.56
And tonight, I am honored to have one of those brothers

157
00:10:35.68 --> 00:10:36.96
here with me.

158
00:10:36.96 --> 00:10:41.96
And he's a Marine Corps Aviator, fighter pilot

159
00:10:44.68 --> 00:10:49.52
who also did time as a forward air controller on the ground.

160
00:10:49.52 --> 00:10:52.20
And we've talked about that in many of the books

161
00:10:52.20 --> 00:10:53.68
that we've reviewed on the podcast

162
00:10:53.68 --> 00:10:56.24
where you have a Marine Corps pilot

163
00:10:56.24 --> 00:10:59.32
who's now on the ground with the troops.

164
00:11:00.64 --> 00:11:02.52
Usually in one of the most forward positions

165
00:11:02.52 --> 00:11:07.52
because they have to know where the troops are, out of that

166
00:11:08.80 --> 00:11:13.80
air conditioned cockpit and into the sweat and mud

167
00:11:14.12 --> 00:11:19.12
on the ground and this pilot as an Anglico team leader

168
00:11:20.56 --> 00:11:23.60
who with his team conducted dozens and dozens

169
00:11:23.60 --> 00:11:26.000
of missions with Tasmania Bruser in Ramadi

170
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.44
and I've talked about bringing them on the show.

171
00:11:28.44 --> 00:11:33.44
And so here he is tonight, Lieutenant Colonel,

172
00:11:34.12 --> 00:11:39.28
almost retired, David Burke.

173
00:11:39.28 --> 00:11:44.28
Dave, welcome to the podcast and thank you for coming on.

174
00:11:46.60 --> 00:11:47.56
Thanks for having me, man.

175
00:11:47.56 --> 00:11:48.40
It's good to be here.

176
00:11:50.68 --> 00:11:55.68
So we have to, before we talk about what we went through

177
00:11:55.92 --> 00:11:58.000
together, we have to learn a little bit about you

178
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.52
where you came from, what you did

179
00:12:00.52 --> 00:12:03.68
and how you went from being,

180
00:12:04.60 --> 00:12:08.40
from being a pilot, but not just a pilot,

181
00:12:08.40 --> 00:12:10.48
a top gun pilot, but not just a top gun pilot,

182
00:12:10.48 --> 00:12:13.12
but a top gun instructor

183
00:12:14.72 --> 00:12:18.20
which is just incredibly selective.

184
00:12:18.20 --> 00:12:20.76
That's gonna be one of the most selective things

185
00:12:20.76 --> 00:12:22.76
in the whole world.

186
00:12:22.76 --> 00:12:23.60
Right?

187
00:12:23.60 --> 00:12:25.44
How many top gun pilots are there?

188
00:12:25.44 --> 00:12:27.92
So you've got 25 at a time every three years that kind of rotate

189
00:12:27.92 --> 00:12:29.48
through a small group.

190
00:12:29.48 --> 00:12:32.76
Yeah, so that's ridiculous.

191
00:12:32.76 --> 00:12:36.32
And, but then you thought maybe I you need to get after

192
00:12:36.32 --> 00:12:37.80
a little bit more, so you're gonna go do an A,

193
00:12:37.80 --> 00:12:40.56
because so we'll get into that, but let's start off with

194
00:12:40.56 --> 00:12:44.96
where you came from, just a little bit about your background

195
00:12:44.96 --> 00:12:47.08
and how you ended up saying, you know what I think I wanna do?

196
00:12:47.08 --> 00:12:49.80
Being the Marine Corps, go.

197
00:12:49.80 --> 00:12:51.12
Right on.

198
00:12:51.12 --> 00:12:52.40
So I actually grew up around here.

199
00:12:52.40 --> 00:12:53.64
My parents moved out here,

200
00:12:53.64 --> 00:12:55.76
San Diego and I was probably a year and a half years old.

201
00:12:55.76 --> 00:12:57.32
I wanted half years old.

202
00:12:57.32 --> 00:12:59.20
In between, here in Orange County, I grew up

203
00:12:59.20 --> 00:13:00.36
in Silicon Valley, California, kid.

204
00:13:02.36 --> 00:13:04.16
Not all that exciting with childhood.

205
00:13:04.16 --> 00:13:06.60
I don't have, you know, a ton of crazy memories.

206
00:13:06.60 --> 00:13:08.56
I was pretty quiet kid as a good kid in school.

207
00:13:08.56 --> 00:13:10.16
Got a long with most folks.

208
00:13:11.96 --> 00:13:13.56
Moved up Orange County, my parents got divorced.

209
00:13:13.56 --> 00:13:16.08
It was basically just me and my mom and my sister for a while.

210
00:13:16.08 --> 00:13:19.12
And I lived in a town called El Toro

211
00:13:19.12 --> 00:13:21.92
and what happened to be very close to where I grew up

212
00:13:21.92 --> 00:13:24.32
was a Marine Base, it was a fighter base.

213
00:13:24.32 --> 00:13:27.68
And so as a kid, I posed there in late 70s

214
00:13:27.68 --> 00:13:32.68
and early 80s they had F4 fanomes and A4s and A6s

215
00:13:32.68 --> 00:13:34.56
and just the cool jets at the time.

216
00:13:34.56 --> 00:13:37.56
And so I went to the air show every year,

217
00:13:37.56 --> 00:13:39.68
grew up out there and I think it was no joke.

218
00:13:39.68 --> 00:13:41.52
It was overhead, I could see it every day.

219
00:13:41.52 --> 00:13:43.88
And I think that just got my blood a little bit.

220
00:13:45.64 --> 00:13:47.68
Went to El Toro high school, went to the air show,

221
00:13:47.68 --> 00:13:50.28
probably every year from my six years old till the time

222
00:13:50.28 --> 00:13:51.68
the base closed down, no joke.

223
00:13:51.68 --> 00:13:53.64
I mean it was just part of my life.

224
00:13:53.64 --> 00:13:55.64
And I met some people along the way too.

225
00:13:55.64 --> 00:13:56.56
There was a lot of Marines living there.

226
00:13:56.56 --> 00:13:58.20
So I had some real powerful influences

227
00:13:58.20 --> 00:13:59.76
that kind of got him towards that.

228
00:14:01.08 --> 00:14:02.32
I'm sure we're gonna get into this

229
00:14:02.32 --> 00:14:04.36
because it's come up already in the pre-conversation.

230
00:14:04.36 --> 00:14:06.28
Put it around 14, let's say.

231
00:14:06.28 --> 00:14:09.92
Watch this obscure movie called Top Gun.

232
00:14:09.92 --> 00:14:11.40
Straight up, top Gun.

233
00:14:11.40 --> 00:14:12.96
Straight up man.

234
00:14:12.96 --> 00:14:14.56
Watch the movie is a kid.

235
00:14:14.56 --> 00:14:18.04
Saw dudes flying airplanes, off carriers,

236
00:14:18.04 --> 00:14:19.96
shooting down mags and I'm like,

237
00:14:19.96 --> 00:14:21.12
I wanna do that.

238
00:14:21.12 --> 00:14:25.32
And probably by 14, I had a pretty good idea

239
00:14:25.32 --> 00:14:26.48
that's what I wanted to do.

240
00:14:27.64 --> 00:14:30.60
Did you make the connection between school and grades

241
00:14:30.60 --> 00:14:31.44
and all that stuff?

242
00:14:31.44 --> 00:14:33.000
Because a lot of people saw that movie and said,

243
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.28
I wanna be a top Gun pilot,

244
00:14:34.28 --> 00:14:36.52
but I'm still gonna slack off and do whatever I want

245
00:14:36.52 --> 00:14:38.72
and not play hooky and all that.

246
00:14:38.72 --> 00:14:40.16
Somehow you made that connection.

247
00:14:40.16 --> 00:14:41.56
It's not shown in the movie, right?

248
00:14:41.56 --> 00:14:44.000
They didn't show people studying hard in school

249
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.60
because that would have not sold a lot of tickets.

250
00:14:46.60 --> 00:14:47.44
Oh no.

251
00:14:47.44 --> 00:14:49.84
I did eventually.

252
00:14:49.84 --> 00:14:51.24
I mean, when I watched that movie,

253
00:14:51.24 --> 00:14:52.44
I think there was just something,

254
00:14:52.44 --> 00:14:53.72
I'd always been interested in aviation.

255
00:14:53.72 --> 00:14:55.80
It's kind of captivating when you see planes flying around

256
00:14:55.80 --> 00:14:57.20
and to get to see the air shows, see the blue angels,

257
00:14:57.20 --> 00:14:57.68
I kind of said,

258
00:14:57.68 --> 00:14:59.12
if you can't help it look up and watch that stuff,

259
00:14:59.12 --> 00:14:59.96
it's cool.

260
00:15:01.92 --> 00:15:05.16
I would say that my performance in the academic arena

261
00:15:05.16 --> 00:15:07.24
was slightly less than stellar.

262
00:15:07.24 --> 00:15:11.52
I did find, but I had no real motivation to do anything.

263
00:15:11.52 --> 00:15:15.36
I wasn't a little driven kid to work really hard.

264
00:15:15.36 --> 00:15:17.20
I kind of discovered that if I put in very,

265
00:15:17.20 --> 00:15:18.68
little effort, I was okay.

266
00:15:18.68 --> 00:15:19.80
And if I wanted to do really well,

267
00:15:19.80 --> 00:15:20.76
I had to put in a lot of effort

268
00:15:20.76 --> 00:15:22.12
and I had made a much of a connection.

269
00:15:22.12 --> 00:15:25.12
But as I got a little older,

270
00:15:25.12 --> 00:15:25.92
you know, watch the movie,

271
00:15:25.92 --> 00:15:27.56
I think that was a part of a lot of different things.

272
00:15:27.56 --> 00:15:29.000
But about the time I was 16,

273
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.20
it kind of junior year in high school.

274
00:15:32.28 --> 00:15:34.000
As I got some other influences in my life,

275
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.56
I found big as one was a guy named Aaron Irvin.

276
00:15:35.56 --> 00:15:37.12
I started working at Target around the corner

277
00:15:37.12 --> 00:15:38.72
from my house and he was a Marine there.

278
00:15:38.72 --> 00:15:41.20
And like I said, my parents got divorced.

279
00:15:41.20 --> 00:15:43.40
I had a step dad that was there

280
00:15:43.40 --> 00:15:44.32
and kind of coming going,

281
00:15:44.32 --> 00:15:46.20
he ended up being a really big father figure in my life.

282
00:15:46.20 --> 00:15:48.72
And a real positive influence and a Marine,

283
00:15:48.72 --> 00:15:49.40
which was great.

284
00:15:49.40 --> 00:15:52.08
And he explains some more things about what it's like

285
00:15:52.08 --> 00:15:52.92
to be in Marine.

286
00:15:52.92 --> 00:15:54.56
He's the one that made the connection for me

287
00:15:54.56 --> 00:15:56.24
that all that stuff you saw in the movie

288
00:15:56.24 --> 00:15:57.44
is you can actually do that for real.

289
00:15:57.44 --> 00:15:59.24
The Marine Corps, you can do that as a Marine.

290
00:15:59.24 --> 00:16:00.28
You know, it's not just a movie.

291
00:16:00.28 --> 00:16:01.12
That's a real life.

292
00:16:01.12 --> 00:16:03.12
Somebody's living that life right now.

293
00:16:03.12 --> 00:16:04.52
And you can do that.

294
00:16:04.52 --> 00:16:06.96
And I remember coming home and kind of telling my mom,

295
00:16:06.96 --> 00:16:09.28
like, hey, I'm 16, I'm a junior high school.

296
00:16:09.28 --> 00:16:11.96
I'm thinking about being a Marine Corps fighter pilot,

297
00:16:11.96 --> 00:16:13.56
which I had no military in my back

298
00:16:13.56 --> 00:16:16.16
or nobody had ever done anything like that.

299
00:16:16.16 --> 00:16:17.80
And her answer was,

300
00:16:17.80 --> 00:16:18.76
that sounds awesome.

301
00:16:18.76 --> 00:16:19.80
You should do that.

302
00:16:19.80 --> 00:16:23.12
I mean, just 100% and she had a very similar approach.

303
00:16:23.12 --> 00:16:24.20
You know, everything, I have a,

304
00:16:24.20 --> 00:16:27.84
every idea I ever had in my life that I run by my mom,

305
00:16:27.84 --> 00:16:29.16
she's like, well, somebody's gonna do it.

306
00:16:29.16 --> 00:16:29.96
Mine's all be you.

307
00:16:29.96 --> 00:16:31.08
That was kind of a approach to everything.

308
00:16:31.08 --> 00:16:32.52
I want to be a fighter pilot in the Marine Corps.

309
00:16:32.52 --> 00:16:33.20
So I'm just gonna be it.

310
00:16:33.20 --> 00:16:34.84
Mine's all be you.

311
00:16:34.84 --> 00:16:36.68
And that's about the time I kind of started

312
00:16:36.68 --> 00:16:37.96
getting my stuff together.

313
00:16:37.96 --> 00:16:39.68
I mean, I wasn't a mess by any stretch,

314
00:16:39.68 --> 00:16:41.32
but I was a little bit just kind of,

315
00:16:41.32 --> 00:16:43.24
run through my thing, being a kid.

316
00:16:43.24 --> 00:16:46.52
And I certainly think I was lucky

317
00:16:46.52 --> 00:16:51.32
because I knew with great detail

318
00:16:51.32 --> 00:16:54.36
at about 16 and change what I wanted to do.

319
00:16:54.36 --> 00:16:56.12
I mean, I knew I wanted to be a Marine Corps

320
00:16:56.12 --> 00:16:58.40
at 18 pilot based in Southern California

321
00:16:58.40 --> 00:17:00.12
and for life carriers.

322
00:17:00.12 --> 00:17:01.76
And that's exactly what ended up doing.

323
00:17:01.76 --> 00:17:04.40
So at that time, everything I started to do

324
00:17:04.40 --> 00:17:07.04
from there was with that kind of singular focus

325
00:17:07.04 --> 00:17:09.48
of circling back to do that.

326
00:17:09.48 --> 00:17:11.04
I even knew I wanted to be stationed at Altorra.

327
00:17:11.04 --> 00:17:13.96
I mean, I had a real specific plan.

328
00:17:13.96 --> 00:17:15.76
And so all the things I started doing from there,

329
00:17:15.76 --> 00:17:18.36
school, you know, into college as well,

330
00:17:18.36 --> 00:17:19.20
go into the Marine Corps,

331
00:17:19.20 --> 00:17:21.16
and recruit her to say I wanted to join the Marine Corps,

332
00:17:21.16 --> 00:17:22.44
be an officer in the Marine Corps.

333
00:17:22.44 --> 00:17:24.40
All those things were geared very specifically

334
00:17:24.40 --> 00:17:25.24
towards that goal.

335
00:17:25.24 --> 00:17:26.52
Now there's a ton of hurdles

336
00:17:26.52 --> 00:17:27.76
between time you're 16 and time.

337
00:17:27.76 --> 00:17:29.68
I got my commission at 21.

338
00:17:29.68 --> 00:17:32.28
But everything else that I did in my life

339
00:17:32.28 --> 00:17:34.96
was either a distraction that just got rid of,

340
00:17:34.96 --> 00:17:37.28
or it was a means to that end.

341
00:17:37.28 --> 00:17:39.16
I worked full time,

342
00:17:39.16 --> 00:17:42.88
I was in school, put myself through the nearest college,

343
00:17:42.88 --> 00:17:45.12
the local state school that I lived,

344
00:17:45.12 --> 00:17:47.32
close to as a drove up to school,

345
00:17:47.32 --> 00:17:49.000
didn't have like a real big exciting college life.

346
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.04
Wasn't in the fraternity, didn't go away to school.

347
00:17:52.04 --> 00:17:54.000
I paid my way through a school.

348
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.96
I got a good education.

349
00:17:54.96 --> 00:17:56.80
I worked really hard to do well,

350
00:17:56.80 --> 00:17:59.28
but it was all specifically designed to,

351
00:17:59.28 --> 00:18:00.60
you want to be in the Marine Corps and be an officer,

352
00:18:00.60 --> 00:18:03.000
you need to college graduate, you need to be a college graduate.

353
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.16
Right on, I can do that.

354
00:18:04.16 --> 00:18:05.000
I can do that here.

355
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.84
Where's the closest college?

356
00:18:05.84 --> 00:18:06.96
Yeah, where's the closest college?

357
00:18:06.96 --> 00:18:07.80
How much does it cost?

358
00:18:07.80 --> 00:18:08.64
How much do I need to work?

359
00:18:08.64 --> 00:18:09.48
Did the math.

360
00:18:09.48 --> 00:18:11.92
It was my life from about that time.

361
00:18:11.92 --> 00:18:14.72
I started working, like I said, I worked at Target as a kid.

362
00:18:14.72 --> 00:18:17.52
I worked at Target from the time I was 15 and a half

363
00:18:17.52 --> 00:18:20.000
and got to work permit from school to the time

364
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.12
that I got my commission in the Marine Corps.

365
00:18:22.12 --> 00:18:24.28
And I went to school and Casay Fullerton,

366
00:18:24.28 --> 00:18:25.48
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

367
00:18:25.48 --> 00:18:27.04
My mom was a guidance counselor in a teacher,

368
00:18:27.04 --> 00:18:28.56
so she helped me build a schedule

369
00:18:28.56 --> 00:18:30.72
that I could graduate this fast as possible,

370
00:18:30.72 --> 00:18:32.40
which is exactly in four years.

371
00:18:32.40 --> 00:18:33.84
It was all day Monday, all day Wednesday,

372
00:18:33.84 --> 00:18:35.44
and half a day Friday.

373
00:18:35.44 --> 00:18:38.52
And I worked Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

374
00:18:38.52 --> 00:18:41.24
The money I paid, I got paid, I went to my tuition,

375
00:18:41.24 --> 00:18:43.16
my tuition went to my education, my education,

376
00:18:43.16 --> 00:18:45.000
got me a commission in the Marine Corps.

377
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.36
I mean, that was kind of it.

378
00:18:46.36 --> 00:18:47.52
I mean, in some ways you look back,

379
00:18:47.52 --> 00:18:49.52
I'm probably could have diversified a little bit.

380
00:18:49.52 --> 00:18:51.68
But at the time, I wasn't unhappy.

381
00:18:51.68 --> 00:18:52.92
I was stoked, man.

382
00:18:52.92 --> 00:18:54.32
I was exactly what I wanted to be doing.

383
00:18:54.32 --> 00:18:56.32
There was no man I wish I could be doing this.

384
00:18:56.32 --> 00:18:58.32
It wasn't a chore by any stretch.

385
00:18:58.32 --> 00:19:00.52
Like I said, in retrospect, I probably could have done things

386
00:19:00.52 --> 00:19:03.16
a little bit differently, but 17-year-old day-birth,

387
00:19:03.16 --> 00:19:05.56
18-year-old day-birth, new exactly what

388
00:19:05.56 --> 00:19:06.000
he wanted to do.

389
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.56
And I had sort of talked myself into it.

390
00:19:07.56 --> 00:19:10.16
Like, hey, any detour, that's going to throw you off your path, man.

391
00:19:10.16 --> 00:19:12.60
And you're going to look back with it regretting go,

392
00:19:12.60 --> 00:19:14.64
you know why you didn't have been what you wanted to be?

393
00:19:14.64 --> 00:19:15.68
You just took us at this or that.

394
00:19:15.68 --> 00:19:16.88
And I wasn't going to let that happen.

395
00:19:16.88 --> 00:19:20.04
So I kind of just got a little intense about being

396
00:19:20.04 --> 00:19:21.72
a pound in the Marine Corps and sharing it up.

397
00:19:21.72 --> 00:19:24.60
And there's still luck involved, because when you go to TBS,

398
00:19:24.60 --> 00:19:27.88
which is the basic school, which all marine officers go through,

399
00:19:27.88 --> 00:19:33.92
you have to still win or get that billet that you wanted.

400
00:19:33.92 --> 00:19:35.52
And you got that.

401
00:19:35.52 --> 00:19:38.36
But I mean, that could have gone totally mad.

402
00:19:38.36 --> 00:19:38.96
Sideways.

403
00:19:38.96 --> 00:19:41.12
There's a lot of luck involved.

404
00:19:41.12 --> 00:19:43.68
I think everybody in the military, and everybody that's

405
00:19:43.68 --> 00:19:45.56
been successful in the military knows you're looking back

406
00:19:45.56 --> 00:19:48.36
in your career, it's a confluence of a lot of different things.

407
00:19:48.36 --> 00:19:51.000
But timing, circumstance, and luck, or they're a part of it

408
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.72
without a doubt.

409
00:19:51.72 --> 00:19:53.52
Nobody can take credit for everything they've done.

410
00:19:53.52 --> 00:19:56.000
And if I went back to do it again, the odds of it

411
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.48
work out the way they did are pretty slim.

412
00:19:57.48 --> 00:20:01.20
There's just a lot of things that worked out on my favor.

413
00:20:01.20 --> 00:20:02.76
But I went to OCS.

414
00:20:02.76 --> 00:20:04.16
I went to the Marine Corps recruit,

415
00:20:04.16 --> 00:20:06.32
started my freshman year at Cal State Fullerton,

416
00:20:06.32 --> 00:20:09.36
as a 17-1er sort of college, went right to their crew

417
00:20:09.36 --> 00:20:12.12
around day one, or they called an OCS officer selection officer.

418
00:20:12.12 --> 00:20:13.52
So it's basically a recruiter for officers.

419
00:20:13.52 --> 00:20:14.28
I want to be in Marine.

420
00:20:14.28 --> 00:20:16.84
It's like right on, start filling up the spade work.

421
00:20:16.84 --> 00:20:18.48
But at the payboard, I said, I want to be a pilot,

422
00:20:18.48 --> 00:20:20.04
as a piece of cake, no problem.

423
00:20:20.04 --> 00:20:22.28
We can make that happen.

424
00:20:22.28 --> 00:20:24.08
Sign this ground contract, and we'll just make it

425
00:20:24.08 --> 00:20:25.08
part of the standpoint of the future.

426
00:20:25.08 --> 00:20:29.40
So for those of you that don't know, that's a big lie.

427
00:20:29.40 --> 00:20:30.96
It ain't that easy.

428
00:20:30.96 --> 00:20:32.96
So when he says ground contract, of course,

429
00:20:32.96 --> 00:20:36.08
the Marine Corps needs pilots and guys to infantry.

430
00:20:36.08 --> 00:20:39.08
And so, but they need more infantry than they need pilots.

431
00:20:39.08 --> 00:20:40.40
And so they say, hey, don't worry about it.

432
00:20:40.40 --> 00:20:41.88
You just sign up for ground right now.

433
00:20:41.88 --> 00:20:43.12
We'll take care of that other pilot.

434
00:20:43.12 --> 00:20:43.72
You want to be a pie?

435
00:20:43.72 --> 00:20:45.12
Yeah, of course, we'll take care of that later.

436
00:20:45.12 --> 00:20:46.12
Yeah, we'll just transition over.

437
00:20:46.12 --> 00:20:46.76
It should have made a big deal.

438
00:20:46.76 --> 00:20:47.60
No factor.

439
00:20:47.60 --> 00:20:50.44
And at 17, I mean, I was signing paperwork

440
00:20:50.44 --> 00:20:51.36
to be a Marine officer.

441
00:20:51.36 --> 00:20:53.000
That was a big step for me.

442
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.04
And I probably would have signed anything.

443
00:20:55.04 --> 00:20:58.64
Happily signed that after my freshman year in college,

444
00:20:58.64 --> 00:21:01.04
I went to OCS or Canada School.

445
00:21:01.04 --> 00:21:04.000
And to be honest with you, and I had all these big-grand ideas

446
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.72
for the last two, three years, I knew what I wanted to do.

447
00:21:06.72 --> 00:21:10.32
But when I went to OCS, I was a first real hurdle.

448
00:21:10.32 --> 00:21:14.16
I mean, everything else was either an idea, a plan, some paperwork.

449
00:21:14.16 --> 00:21:15.36
I get to the off-circuit of the school.

450
00:21:15.36 --> 00:21:17.56
And it's like, OK, it was a real Marine drill,

451
00:21:17.56 --> 00:21:20.28
and Chuck or Scrimm and Atcha, you're really doing the deed there.

452
00:21:20.28 --> 00:21:23.44
And getting through OCS was a big thing for me,

453
00:21:23.44 --> 00:21:25.44
because it was a first real test of,

454
00:21:25.44 --> 00:21:26.92
and I knew what I wanted to do.

455
00:21:26.92 --> 00:21:29.80
But I had no real sense of I had what was required

456
00:21:29.80 --> 00:21:30.96
to be a Marine.

457
00:21:30.96 --> 00:21:34.28
And I think as a kid, you build up what that is in your mind.

458
00:21:34.28 --> 00:21:36.84
It's a larger than life thing.

459
00:21:36.84 --> 00:21:38.04
How could anybody possibly do this?

460
00:21:38.04 --> 00:21:39.44
You turned it into something more than it is.

461
00:21:39.44 --> 00:21:43.64
When I went to boot camp, there was a Navy seal there.

462
00:21:43.64 --> 00:21:47.80
And I swear, when I saw him, I was like, God, look,

463
00:21:47.80 --> 00:21:52.28
I need huge, huge, big giant farms.

464
00:21:52.28 --> 00:21:55.20
And big, just a big massive guy.

465
00:21:55.20 --> 00:21:58.40
It just looked like a destroyer of human life.

466
00:21:58.40 --> 00:21:59.56
Oh my God.

467
00:21:59.56 --> 00:22:04.12
So fast forward four years on the teams.

468
00:22:04.12 --> 00:22:05.60
And I meet this guy.

469
00:22:05.60 --> 00:22:07.32
And he's not at all man.

470
00:22:07.32 --> 00:22:09.32
He was completely in my head.

471
00:22:09.32 --> 00:22:10.60
It was completely in my head.

472
00:22:10.60 --> 00:22:11.88
But this guy was such a destroyer.

473
00:22:11.88 --> 00:22:14.56
But I just thought, hey, he's a seal.

474
00:22:14.56 --> 00:22:16.04
He must be a destroyer.

475
00:22:16.04 --> 00:22:18.56
And I actually saw it that way.

476
00:22:18.56 --> 00:22:19.04
Yeah.

477
00:22:19.04 --> 00:22:19.84
You can't help it.

478
00:22:19.84 --> 00:22:20.76
And it certainly at that age.

479
00:22:20.76 --> 00:22:23.36
I mean, those things are real powerful influences.

480
00:22:23.36 --> 00:22:25.08
When you get out to OCS and all of a sudden,

481
00:22:25.08 --> 00:22:28.12
you're like, oh, man, I need to, I didn't make this happen.

482
00:22:28.12 --> 00:22:30.24
That was a big achievement in my life.

483
00:22:30.24 --> 00:22:31.32
I said, hey, I can do this.

484
00:22:31.32 --> 00:22:35.48
OK, I started to realize I'm not the biggest guy in the Marine Corps.

485
00:22:35.48 --> 00:22:37.96
Nobody's going to mistake me for a destroyer.

486
00:22:37.96 --> 00:22:39.92
But what I discovered as I got there,

487
00:22:39.92 --> 00:22:42.64
I knew mentally what I wanted to do.

488
00:22:42.64 --> 00:22:44.40
It wasn't a real question mark about my intentions,

489
00:22:44.40 --> 00:22:45.40
or my desires.

490
00:22:45.40 --> 00:22:47.68
And I was surrounded by tough, strong kids.

491
00:22:47.68 --> 00:22:49.88
Young kids, my age that are trying to bring marine officers.

492
00:22:49.88 --> 00:22:52.80
And that's a physical and a mental challenge.

493
00:22:52.80 --> 00:22:53.80
So there's no doubt about it.

494
00:22:53.80 --> 00:22:56.08
And I was seeing guys kind of left and right of me

495
00:22:56.08 --> 00:23:01.20
that looked at least bigger, faster, stronger, tougher.

496
00:23:01.20 --> 00:23:03.32
And more capable than they looked like that.

497
00:23:03.32 --> 00:23:04.48
That same image I had in your mind.

498
00:23:04.48 --> 00:23:06.60
And I'm watching these things kind of fall out of stuff.

499
00:23:06.60 --> 00:23:07.88
We're not finished stuff fast enough.

500
00:23:07.88 --> 00:23:10.32
We're just straight up quit.

501
00:23:10.32 --> 00:23:13.16
Guys would deal or drop on requests at OCS.

502
00:23:13.16 --> 00:23:18.68
And I was kind of looking around thinking, what's going on?

503
00:23:18.68 --> 00:23:21.72
Why are you here if your plan wasn't to get through it?

504
00:23:21.72 --> 00:23:26.12
So that was a really good thing for me, psychologically,

505
00:23:26.12 --> 00:23:28.88
to realize that it wasn't just a fantasy or a dream.

506
00:23:28.88 --> 00:23:31.96
I had the potential to be able to do this.

507
00:23:31.96 --> 00:23:33.88
So I got through a C.S.

508
00:23:33.88 --> 00:23:35.12
That's kind of a painful process.

509
00:23:35.12 --> 00:23:36.36
As you know, it's 84 days.

510
00:23:36.36 --> 00:23:37.68
It can be slogging.

511
00:23:37.68 --> 00:23:39.56
You lose a lot of folks doing it for all those

512
00:23:39.56 --> 00:23:40.36
who are just different reasons.

513
00:23:40.36 --> 00:23:41.12
Some people get hurt.

514
00:23:41.12 --> 00:23:41.76
Some people quit.

515
00:23:41.76 --> 00:23:44.16
Some people just can't do it.

516
00:23:44.16 --> 00:23:45.52
And when you get on the backside of that,

517
00:23:45.52 --> 00:23:49.04
like I can make this happen, let's get that air contract.

518
00:23:49.04 --> 00:23:50.44
Well, we'll get to that air contract.

519
00:23:50.44 --> 00:23:51.84
At the basics school.

520
00:23:51.84 --> 00:23:54.64
So when you get your commission, you finish school,

521
00:23:54.64 --> 00:23:56.56
you get your degree, finish officer,

522
00:23:56.56 --> 00:23:58.60
candid school, and so basically it's a head you've done everything

523
00:23:58.60 --> 00:23:59.40
that you need.

524
00:23:59.40 --> 00:24:01.000
Your commission officer became a second-of-the-end

525
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.52
in the Marine Corps in June of 1994.

526
00:24:03.52 --> 00:24:05.48
And the first thing you do is on active duty as a Marine

527
00:24:05.48 --> 00:24:06.84
is you go to something called the basis school.

528
00:24:06.84 --> 00:24:08.84
And you've talked about it a few times.

529
00:24:08.84 --> 00:24:10.36
It's basically a school for the Marine Corps

530
00:24:10.36 --> 00:24:12.76
teaches officers a little bit of everything.

531
00:24:12.76 --> 00:24:14.84
Doesn't teach you everything of anything,

532
00:24:14.84 --> 00:24:16.76
but you get a little exposure to infantry,

533
00:24:16.76 --> 00:24:19.20
you expose your tanks, artillery, call for fire,

534
00:24:19.20 --> 00:24:22.16
you get a little exposure aviation, patrol, and defense off.

535
00:24:22.16 --> 00:24:24.08
And so you kind of get a whole way in the land

536
00:24:24.08 --> 00:24:26.44
and the whole point of that for the Marine Corps,

537
00:24:26.44 --> 00:24:28.20
you go there with 250 people.

538
00:24:28.20 --> 00:24:30.68
And they got to give you one of those people in assignment.

539
00:24:30.68 --> 00:24:34.44
A particular job and MLS, a specialty.

540
00:24:34.44 --> 00:24:35.52
And they rank you.

541
00:24:35.52 --> 00:24:39.12
I mean, you are ranked from one to 250.

542
00:24:39.12 --> 00:24:41.32
And for aviation when I got there,

543
00:24:41.32 --> 00:24:42.88
I remember getting in the first week.

544
00:24:42.88 --> 00:24:44.20
They kind of announced what billets

545
00:24:44.20 --> 00:24:45.44
are going to be available.

546
00:24:45.44 --> 00:24:48.44
I were going to have 40 infantry slots and 20.

547
00:24:48.44 --> 00:24:50.84
They just tell you kind of what we expect to have

548
00:24:50.84 --> 00:24:51.44
breakdown.

549
00:24:51.44 --> 00:24:52.84
And from there, you're supposed to go back and think

550
00:24:52.84 --> 00:24:54.92
about what you want to do.

551
00:24:54.92 --> 00:24:57.28
They had two pilot slots.

552
00:24:57.28 --> 00:24:59.52
And like, man, that is some rough math,

553
00:24:59.52 --> 00:25:00.48
250 folks.

554
00:25:00.48 --> 00:25:02.52
Now, not all 250 wanted to be a pilot.

555
00:25:02.52 --> 00:25:06.48
Obviously, not all 250 people were qualified with their eyes

556
00:25:06.48 --> 00:25:07.24
and whatnot.

557
00:25:07.24 --> 00:25:10.20
So it wasn't competing with 250 people.

558
00:25:10.20 --> 00:25:12.32
But there's a lot of people that wanted to be a pilot.

559
00:25:12.32 --> 00:25:14.04
So the math was certainly not in my favor.

560
00:25:14.04 --> 00:25:17.60
And that was another challenge of, yeah, you got to do well.

561
00:25:17.60 --> 00:25:19.96
I mean, you get ranked and graded on everything.

562
00:25:19.96 --> 00:25:22.56
Physical fitness, your leadership ability, your academics.

563
00:25:22.56 --> 00:25:25.16
You get peer reviewed, your peers rate you,

564
00:25:25.16 --> 00:25:26.84
and you know, anonymously, and what they think of you.

565
00:25:26.84 --> 00:25:29.88
So you got basically six months to get after it.

566
00:25:29.88 --> 00:25:32.92
And at the end, they line you up, 250 people,

567
00:25:32.92 --> 00:25:35.28
in a line, this is a real line.

568
00:25:35.28 --> 00:25:37.08
And you walk into a room and on the room,

569
00:25:37.08 --> 00:25:38.32
there's a board.

570
00:25:38.32 --> 00:25:41.52
And whatever job is available, you can pick.

571
00:25:41.52 --> 00:25:45.36
Now, the Marine Corps does the same called quality spread

572
00:25:45.36 --> 00:25:47.40
where they basically cut the class in third,

573
00:25:47.40 --> 00:25:51.24
so at a 250 folks, 80, 80, 80, or something around there,

574
00:25:51.24 --> 00:25:53.80
the number one guy picks, and then number 81 guy picks,

575
00:25:53.80 --> 00:25:56.96
and then the number 161 guy picks, whatever it is.

576
00:25:56.96 --> 00:25:59.04
And then the number two guy picks.

577
00:25:59.04 --> 00:26:00.88
The only job in the Marine Corps that they did not

578
00:26:00.88 --> 00:26:03.84
quality spread was that the basics school was pilot.

579
00:26:03.84 --> 00:26:07.28
So it was going to be the first two guys out of the gate

580
00:26:07.28 --> 00:26:09.12
that wanted it, that we're qualified, we're going to get it.

581
00:26:09.12 --> 00:26:12.24
And I got the number two spot.

582
00:26:12.24 --> 00:26:16.28
So again, it was one of those things that I was starting

583
00:26:16.28 --> 00:26:20.28
to in my mind realize, well, this I can do this.

584
00:26:20.28 --> 00:26:22.08
I built this thing up when I wanted to do.

585
00:26:22.08 --> 00:26:24.48
I'm 21 now, 22, I think actually.

586
00:26:24.48 --> 00:26:27.52
So it's six years of my life that I've been sort of

587
00:26:27.52 --> 00:26:28.72
singularly dedicated to.

588
00:26:28.72 --> 00:26:31.56
And it's so that day where my platoon commander,

589
00:26:31.56 --> 00:26:32.96
guy named John Marion, I'll never forget it.

590
00:26:32.96 --> 00:26:34.76
He was an F-18 pilot.

591
00:26:34.76 --> 00:26:35.92
Bring to me, it was office.

592
00:26:35.92 --> 00:26:38.52
It's like Dave, you're going to be a pilot.

593
00:26:38.52 --> 00:26:40.84
And I think you're going to fly America's airplane.

594
00:26:40.84 --> 00:26:43.04
You're going to fly the F-18 Hornet.

595
00:26:43.04 --> 00:26:44.32
It was an awesome day, man.

596
00:26:44.32 --> 00:26:47.08
And I want, I want to ever forget it.

597
00:26:47.08 --> 00:26:49.36
And that was it.

598
00:26:49.36 --> 00:26:51.000
I got my ticket.

599
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
When I was selected for a pilot, I was ranked, I think,

600
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.88
like number eight and a 250 in my company.

601
00:26:57.88 --> 00:27:00.000
And by the time I graduated like three weeks later,

602
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.08
I was like 25 and a 250.

603
00:27:02.08 --> 00:27:06.04
So my performance might have declined a little bit after I had achieved

604
00:27:06.04 --> 00:27:07.04
that.

605
00:27:07.04 --> 00:27:08.20
So in the theory of no slack.

606
00:27:08.20 --> 00:27:10.64
Yeah, there was a little slack in that line.

607
00:27:10.64 --> 00:27:12.72
The line was pretty tight for a lot of years.

608
00:27:12.72 --> 00:27:13.36
For six years.

609
00:27:13.36 --> 00:27:14.36
Yeah.

610
00:27:14.36 --> 00:27:14.56
Got it.

611
00:27:14.56 --> 00:27:16.16
So a little bit of slack there at the end.

612
00:27:16.16 --> 00:27:20.48
But I did finish well enough to get that pilot.

613
00:27:20.48 --> 00:27:21.40
Which is what I always wanted.

614
00:27:21.40 --> 00:27:22.20
It was kind of my dream.

615
00:27:22.20 --> 00:27:23.64
What year was that?

616
00:27:23.64 --> 00:27:25.80
That was April of 1995.

617
00:27:25.80 --> 00:27:28.000
So I started the basic school in October of 1994.

618
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.44
Right after I got a graduate in college in June,

619
00:27:30.44 --> 00:27:33.36
little delay to get down to Quantico for the basic school.

620
00:27:33.36 --> 00:27:34.08
That's six months long.

621
00:27:34.08 --> 00:27:35.68
I graduated sometime in mid-April.

622
00:27:35.68 --> 00:27:38.40
Well, well, about this time in 1995.

623
00:27:38.40 --> 00:27:40.08
So.

624
00:27:40.08 --> 00:27:41.92
And then you had a flight school.

625
00:27:41.92 --> 00:27:42.44
Yeah.

626
00:27:42.44 --> 00:27:43.08
You'd do the rag.

627
00:27:43.08 --> 00:27:45.24
You'd do all that stuff to get out to a squad.

628
00:27:45.24 --> 00:27:47.76
And then the first kind of work you were doing was

629
00:27:47.76 --> 00:27:49.16
Southern Watch, right?

630
00:27:49.16 --> 00:27:49.52
Yeah.

631
00:27:49.52 --> 00:27:51.60
So I get through a flight school and pick an F-A-Teen.

632
00:27:51.60 --> 00:27:53.08
I get stationed at El Toro.

633
00:27:53.08 --> 00:27:55.24
So I am literally living the dream.

634
00:27:55.24 --> 00:27:56.48
I'm back to my hometown.

635
00:27:59.16 --> 00:28:02.12
I think I went to like my tenure high school reunion.

636
00:28:02.12 --> 00:28:03.64
And I had told all my buddies, you know,

637
00:28:03.64 --> 00:28:06.68
I wanted to do a run into some people I hadn't seen

638
00:28:06.68 --> 00:28:07.32
in the whiles.

639
00:28:07.32 --> 00:28:08.60
It was good.

640
00:28:08.60 --> 00:28:12.24
And shortly after I got there, I actually flew the last flight

641
00:28:12.24 --> 00:28:12.76
at El Toro.

642
00:28:12.76 --> 00:28:14.20
They closed the base and all the Marines moved down

643
00:28:14.20 --> 00:28:14.76
to Miramar.

644
00:28:14.76 --> 00:28:17.56
So the Navy, where Topkin was filmed and all that stuff

645
00:28:17.56 --> 00:28:20.20
back in the day, the Navy left San Diego.

646
00:28:20.20 --> 00:28:22.36
Move back east and the Marine Corps happily took over

647
00:28:22.36 --> 00:28:22.88
that base.

648
00:28:22.88 --> 00:28:26.24
And so I moved down to Miramar and it up in an F-A-Teen squadron.

649
00:28:26.24 --> 00:28:29.08
Station to Miramar, flying, Hornets off carriers.

650
00:28:29.08 --> 00:28:31.08
Straight up, living in June.

651
00:28:31.08 --> 00:28:33.92
I mean, actual dream you are now living in this time.

652
00:28:33.92 --> 00:28:36.28
That's exactly right.

653
00:28:36.28 --> 00:28:38.56
I'm living in San Diego.

654
00:28:38.56 --> 00:28:41.68
I was living in PB off and in Kappa.

655
00:28:41.68 --> 00:28:44.92
And Station to Miramar, flying Hornets.

656
00:28:44.92 --> 00:28:47.28
And the carrier that I was assigned to,

657
00:28:47.28 --> 00:28:49.76
my first deployment, we did Operation Southern Watch.

658
00:28:49.76 --> 00:28:53.16
So, you know, I watched Desert Storm in 91 on TV.

659
00:28:53.16 --> 00:28:55.08
I was in freshman in college.

660
00:28:55.08 --> 00:28:58.20
And we hadn't done much in the military since then,

661
00:28:58.20 --> 00:29:00.24
but we had flown every single day

662
00:29:00.24 --> 00:29:01.52
since that war ended.

663
00:29:01.52 --> 00:29:04.000
And I think it was March of 91.

664
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.04
Every single day since then, we flew patrols over Iraq

665
00:29:07.04 --> 00:29:09.44
to make sure that the skies were clear.

666
00:29:09.44 --> 00:29:11.80
And we were enforcing the no-fly zone.

667
00:29:11.80 --> 00:29:15.88
And here it was, you know, 10 years later, 2000 on a carrier

668
00:29:15.88 --> 00:29:20.88
in the Persian Gulf, flying combat operations over Southern Iraq.

669
00:29:21.76 --> 00:29:23.20
Did you guys ever drop me bombs, huh?

670
00:29:23.20 --> 00:29:24.04
I did.

671
00:29:24.04 --> 00:29:24.88
Yeah, a few of us did.

672
00:29:24.88 --> 00:29:25.88
Not a ton.

673
00:29:25.88 --> 00:29:26.72
There wasn't a ton going on, but what we would do,

674
00:29:26.72 --> 00:29:27.92
these things called response options.

675
00:29:27.92 --> 00:29:29.84
So if that Iraq is we'd do something, I think, in my case,

676
00:29:29.84 --> 00:29:32.76
they set up a surface air missile, south of a line

677
00:29:32.76 --> 00:29:33.72
that they weren't supposed to be.

678
00:29:33.72 --> 00:29:35.96
And we had surveillance at told us what was out there.

679
00:29:35.96 --> 00:29:39.40
And I launched an omission on Blupper, a SAMHSAite,

680
00:29:39.40 --> 00:29:40.88
with something called a J-Dam at the time.

681
00:29:40.88 --> 00:29:44.88
It was a bomb guided by GPS, which at the time was this brand new

682
00:29:44.88 --> 00:29:45.40
operation.

683
00:29:45.40 --> 00:29:46.60
Yeah, it was crazy technology.

684
00:29:46.60 --> 00:29:48.36
I think we were on the only planes in the entire carrier

685
00:29:48.36 --> 00:29:50.64
that could do it, because we had this thing called a GPS,

686
00:29:50.64 --> 00:29:51.88
super fancy back then.

687
00:29:53.08 --> 00:29:55.44
But at the time, J-Dam, that was combat.

688
00:29:55.44 --> 00:29:58.20
That was, there was no other show in town.

689
00:29:58.20 --> 00:30:03.20
And so then I dropped a bomb on a SAMHSAite in Iraq,

690
00:30:03.20 --> 00:30:06.24
off a carrier in an F-18.

691
00:30:06.24 --> 00:30:08.80
You could have just retired there.

692
00:30:08.80 --> 00:30:09.80
We're done here to go.

693
00:30:09.80 --> 00:30:11.96
I could have come back to that.

694
00:30:11.96 --> 00:30:13.08
It could have flown me off the ship.

695
00:30:13.08 --> 00:30:15.56
And I probably would have died a happy man at that point.

696
00:30:15.56 --> 00:30:16.56
That's it.

697
00:30:16.56 --> 00:30:17.84
I have reached critical mass.

698
00:30:17.84 --> 00:30:18.92
That's all I ever wanted to do.

699
00:30:18.92 --> 00:30:23.56
So it was, again, a lot of it was just things

700
00:30:23.56 --> 00:30:26.04
worked out of my favor, but I did exactly what I wanted to do

701
00:30:26.04 --> 00:30:28.96
when that event was kind of at the time, sort of the pinnacle.

702
00:30:28.96 --> 00:30:30.44
That was what I thought I was going to achieve.

703
00:30:30.44 --> 00:30:31.76
Yeah, I mean, it's the same thing in the dry years

704
00:30:31.76 --> 00:30:32.44
for the seal teams.

705
00:30:32.44 --> 00:30:37.20
Like if you did some kind of mission, you were just super stoked.

706
00:30:37.20 --> 00:30:39.48
We were over in the Persian Gulf.

707
00:30:39.48 --> 00:30:43.40
Actually, at the same time, 1999, 2000, I was there.

708
00:30:43.40 --> 00:30:47.44
I was in the Persian Gulf when we were doing, you know, meal operations, stop

709
00:30:47.44 --> 00:30:48.68
and smugglers coming out of Iraq.

710
00:30:48.68 --> 00:30:51.72
So we were taking down vessels and getting control of them.

711
00:30:51.72 --> 00:30:55.000
And again, at the time, super stoked.

712
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.64
Yes, the big mission was taking out these vessels.

713
00:30:57.64 --> 00:30:58.64
And it thought it was pretty cool.

714
00:30:58.64 --> 00:30:59.64
And it was cool.

715
00:30:59.64 --> 00:31:03.72
But you just didn't have anything to compare it to at all.

716
00:31:03.72 --> 00:31:04.72
Yeah.

717
00:31:04.72 --> 00:31:06.52
So what happened?

718
00:31:06.52 --> 00:31:08.88
So I get back from that deployment.

719
00:31:08.88 --> 00:31:11.96
That's the summer of 2000.

720
00:31:11.96 --> 00:31:16.40
And shortly after that, I got selected by my commanding officer to go to Top Gun.

721
00:31:16.40 --> 00:31:20.04
So that was my first exposure to kind of advancing inside the squadron.

722
00:31:20.04 --> 00:31:22.12
So as a young guy, I've done almost two years in the squadron.

723
00:31:22.12 --> 00:31:25.88
I've been there for a little while and got some qualifications and grew and developed

724
00:31:25.88 --> 00:31:26.40
in the squadron.

725
00:31:26.40 --> 00:31:29.12
And they pick one or two guys every couple years from me,

726
00:31:29.12 --> 00:31:33.12
every squadron to go to the school and the whole point of going there is a U-Learn kind

727
00:31:33.12 --> 00:31:37.36
of this advanced, you know, it's like a master's degree basically in being a fighter pilot

728
00:31:37.36 --> 00:31:41.08
with the intent that you can bring back to the squadron and be one of the kind of key trainers

729
00:31:41.08 --> 00:31:42.08
a key leaders in the squadron.

730
00:31:42.08 --> 00:31:47.88
So I went to Top Gun early the next year, summer of, actually about a year later.

731
00:31:47.88 --> 00:31:53.44
So summer 2001, I got to Top Gun and I came back and we were just in a work outside.

732
00:31:53.44 --> 00:31:56.64
You showed up to Top Gun just sort of really knows.

733
00:31:56.64 --> 00:31:57.64
Yeah.

734
00:31:57.64 --> 00:32:02.04
I mean, especially because you were the big combat vet with bombs dropped and you feel

735
00:32:02.04 --> 00:32:05.16
like you're pretty much a complete stud.

736
00:32:05.16 --> 00:32:06.16
Yeah.

737
00:32:06.16 --> 00:32:10.40
And then you show up at Top Gun and the instructors just can completely annihilate.

738
00:32:10.40 --> 00:32:13.84
And just, first of all, as you don't know, it's, it's, you're learning how to dog fight

739
00:32:13.84 --> 00:32:20.40
mono, e mono against another guy and another plane like stock car racing because the

740
00:32:20.40 --> 00:32:24.80
planes are equal and it's you against the other guy and it was actually cool.

741
00:32:24.80 --> 00:32:28.04
You were explaining some of the rules and how you'd set it up and they have, you know,

742
00:32:28.04 --> 00:32:32.40
and you did, you know, you, you, you, you, okay, you know, you start standing, you know,

743
00:32:32.40 --> 00:32:33.80
you shake hands, bomb fist, I can now it's on.

744
00:32:33.80 --> 00:32:36.32
Well, with the Top Gun, they started a certain distance.

745
00:32:36.32 --> 00:32:39.60
They, they go towards each other at a certain altitude, certain distance away from each

746
00:32:39.60 --> 00:32:40.60
other.

747
00:32:40.60 --> 00:32:44.80
They go, they pass it a thousand feet, you know, left, left wing to left wing.

748
00:32:44.80 --> 00:32:46.88
And then once they pass, they say, what do you say?

749
00:32:46.88 --> 00:32:50.76
Game on fights on fights on fights on and then boom, now it's go.

750
00:32:50.76 --> 00:32:53.04
So that's how they start in their neutral position.

751
00:32:53.04 --> 00:32:58.36
And of course, when you show up there, it's just like you did to, in the fact that it's

752
00:32:58.36 --> 00:33:02.32
like a guy that did a little bit of training somewhere and then they show up at a G.

753
00:33:02.32 --> 00:33:04.28
G. G. G. G. G. G. and they're going to get totally destroyed.

754
00:33:04.28 --> 00:33:06.56
So he shows up, you show up at this thing.

755
00:33:06.56 --> 00:33:07.56
Yeah.

756
00:33:07.56 --> 00:33:11.32
And, and you think you're, again, big combat that you just get annihilated.

757
00:33:11.32 --> 00:33:12.32
Totally.

758
00:33:12.32 --> 00:33:14.84
So yeah, I get that I had dropped a bomb, that's singular.

759
00:33:14.84 --> 00:33:16.60
I had dropped a bomb and bomb.

760
00:33:16.60 --> 00:33:19.16
And I was, I was, I was a big deal.

761
00:33:19.16 --> 00:33:22.52
I do that dropped a bomb, you know, and so at the time I was, I, I thought,

762
00:33:22.52 --> 00:33:24.32
some of the instructors had never done that before, right?

763
00:33:24.32 --> 00:33:26.08
Most of them, like you said, there's the drier.

764
00:33:26.08 --> 00:33:27.32
So it just wasn't a ton going on.

765
00:33:27.32 --> 00:33:31.60
You had a story here and there, but I think more than anything in my own mind, you

766
00:33:31.60 --> 00:33:33.48
kind of build up like I got some game here, man.

767
00:33:33.48 --> 00:33:35.48
I'm going to watch this.

768
00:33:35.48 --> 00:33:37.28
You know, I'm going to do some good work here.

769
00:33:37.28 --> 00:33:39.68
And, you know, I done well enough of my squadron.

770
00:33:39.68 --> 00:33:41.84
And I was one of the guys that got picked to go to school, so you,

771
00:33:41.84 --> 00:33:43.52
which is another little confidence boost.

772
00:33:43.52 --> 00:33:44.52
Yeah, it is.

773
00:33:44.52 --> 00:33:45.52
So your egos getting fed.

774
00:33:45.52 --> 00:33:47.52
It's getting forced fed.

775
00:33:47.52 --> 00:33:48.52
Maybe.

776
00:33:48.52 --> 00:33:49.52
Yeah, a little bit.

777
00:33:49.52 --> 00:33:51.84
Yeah, you're feeling pretty good about yourself.

778
00:33:51.84 --> 00:33:53.16
And so you go up there.

779
00:33:53.16 --> 00:33:58.04
And like you said, so you know, you're, you're a student, you know,

780
00:33:58.04 --> 00:34:01.48
you're not going to be as good as the instructors, but what you don't know is that

781
00:34:01.48 --> 00:34:05.08
you're not just going to lose, you're going to get, you're not just going to lose

782
00:34:05.08 --> 00:34:06.84
or get annihilated, you're not even going to know what happened.

783
00:34:06.84 --> 00:34:09.24
It's going to be over and you're going to kind of be flying back and before you,

784
00:34:09.24 --> 00:34:12.72
you're going to land and you're not going to be able to explain what just occurred.

785
00:34:12.72 --> 00:34:16.96
I mean, it occurs in a way that it's so, it's hard to explain.

786
00:34:16.96 --> 00:34:18.96
It's like you weren't there.

787
00:34:18.96 --> 00:34:21.96
It's really, it's humbling.

788
00:34:21.96 --> 00:34:26.12
I mean, Jacob, we're talking the very first flight on the very first day.

789
00:34:26.12 --> 00:34:29.96
My very first event, the very first flight of the first flight.

790
00:34:29.96 --> 00:34:34.16
It was over in like 20 seconds in the instructor was saying, okay, let's call it and say,

791
00:34:34.16 --> 00:34:35.16
knock it off when we're done.

792
00:34:35.16 --> 00:34:36.84
We're going to start and set it up again.

793
00:34:36.84 --> 00:34:38.68
And any right then, I was totally in over my head.

794
00:34:38.68 --> 00:34:40.60
The very first one.

795
00:34:40.60 --> 00:34:46.60
And it was so my first flight was, it was so bad that when I landed, we're walking back

796
00:34:46.60 --> 00:34:50.48
in to, you go to maintenance and you basically go back and turn the airplane back in and

797
00:34:50.48 --> 00:34:54.08
so they can fix it and then what you're supposed to just walk across through to the squadron

798
00:34:54.08 --> 00:34:56.16
hanger and talk about it.

799
00:34:56.16 --> 00:34:58.40
And I'm in my gear and you're supposed to get on dress out of your flight gear and go

800
00:34:58.40 --> 00:35:01.000
and he's like, hey, don't get on dress.

801
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
And we're going, right?

802
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Right?

803
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Right?

804
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.20
He's like, why don't we just go do that again?

805
00:35:05.20 --> 00:35:07.76
It was bad enough that we didn't even need to talk about it.

806
00:35:07.76 --> 00:35:12.28
We just needed to just, hey, and he's like, hey, why don't you just take a deep breath, man?

807
00:35:12.28 --> 00:35:18.08
And we went and did that flight without even talking about the first one.

808
00:35:18.08 --> 00:35:22.28
So I kind of knew I had some work to do.

809
00:35:22.28 --> 00:35:27.60
So top gun is really good about not just humbling you, but obviously it teaches you a

810
00:35:27.60 --> 00:35:28.60
ton.

811
00:35:28.60 --> 00:35:29.60
It's a six at the time.

812
00:35:29.60 --> 00:35:33.96
It was only six weeks for the Marines because we didn't do some of the syllabus that

813
00:35:33.96 --> 00:35:36.60
the Navy did because we got it elsewhere.

814
00:35:36.60 --> 00:35:39.80
And it's six weeks where you start with literally just you against another guy, one against

815
00:35:39.80 --> 00:35:44.76
one and you end up building up to where it's, you know, six to eight of you on the front,

816
00:35:44.76 --> 00:35:49.04
on the blue side, the friendly side against, you know, 15, 20 simulated adversary.

817
00:35:49.04 --> 00:35:52.60
So it's a, it's a, a lot in a short period of time.

818
00:35:52.60 --> 00:35:57.12
And that idea of being like really bad when you start happens over and over again in the

819
00:35:57.12 --> 00:35:58.12
course.

820
00:35:58.12 --> 00:36:00.84
So you get through the one V1 phase and at the end, like, oh, finally I got this one V1 thing.

821
00:36:00.84 --> 00:36:01.84
I got this thing wired.

822
00:36:01.84 --> 00:36:02.84
I can do this.

823
00:36:02.84 --> 00:36:03.84
Like, all right, cool.

824
00:36:03.84 --> 00:36:06.80
And I'm going to go two against whatever and you just get rolled again.

825
00:36:06.80 --> 00:36:08.12
And you're like, I'm back to square one.

826
00:36:08.12 --> 00:36:12.12
So it builds you up and breaks you down and builds you up, standard military, you know,

827
00:36:12.12 --> 00:36:14.04
just breaks you down to your pieces.

828
00:36:14.04 --> 00:36:18.76
And then the guys there that instructors are so, they're obviously really good.

829
00:36:18.76 --> 00:36:20.36
I mean, that part is sort of speaks for yourself.

830
00:36:20.36 --> 00:36:21.20
They're really good on the airplane.

831
00:36:21.20 --> 00:36:24.08
But what makes them unique is that they're exceptional teachers.

832
00:36:24.08 --> 00:36:25.56
So you learn a ton.

833
00:36:25.56 --> 00:36:29.32
So by the time, a lot of the time you finished up gun, that, that image in the mirror, we

834
00:36:29.32 --> 00:36:30.84
know like, man, that dude was awesome.

835
00:36:30.84 --> 00:36:31.84
They get shattered.

836
00:36:31.84 --> 00:36:33.88
It's actually all back together by the time you leave.

837
00:36:33.88 --> 00:36:36.52
And as you leave there, like, you got that patch in your shoulder.

838
00:36:36.52 --> 00:36:40.12
You fly back, you get the patch in the last day, you get up in your airplane, F-18 with

839
00:36:40.12 --> 00:36:42.96
my name, Pan on the side with the top gun patch and I flew back to Merrimar.

840
00:36:42.96 --> 00:36:47.40
See, you dream is getting better.

841
00:36:47.40 --> 00:36:49.40
But there's been enough reminders.

842
00:36:49.40 --> 00:36:53.88
Like, yeah, I should probably maybe cool out a little bit.

843
00:36:53.88 --> 00:36:56.68
You start to just learn that there's always guys out there that are significantly better

844
00:36:56.68 --> 00:36:57.68
than you.

845
00:36:57.68 --> 00:36:59.64
And you keep climbing up the hill.

846
00:36:59.64 --> 00:37:02.68
But finishing top gun as a student, you feel like you've hit the top of the mountain,

847
00:37:02.68 --> 00:37:06.16
but you realize, because the guys you've been working with, there's an awful long

848
00:37:06.16 --> 00:37:07.000
way to go.

849
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.36
You at least know what you don't know.

850
00:37:08.36 --> 00:37:09.52
Yeah, that's a great way to put it.

851
00:37:09.52 --> 00:37:11.000
You know what you don't know.

852
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.88
And you're there's a lot that you don't know.

853
00:37:12.88 --> 00:37:14.44
And so it kind of dispels all those feeling.

854
00:37:14.44 --> 00:37:15.40
You know, we went through flight school.

855
00:37:15.40 --> 00:37:17.72
Like, wow, I'm a finished flight school.

856
00:37:17.72 --> 00:37:18.72
I got to F-18s.

857
00:37:18.72 --> 00:37:20.20
I've really got this flying thing nail.

858
00:37:20.20 --> 00:37:24.04
And you're barely functional in your plane compared to these other guys.

859
00:37:24.04 --> 00:37:29.60
And when you get to a place like top gun, it's just such a concentration of talent.

860
00:37:29.60 --> 00:37:31.32
You, it's good as it feels.

861
00:37:31.32 --> 00:37:34.96
You actually, the thing you get the most out of the humility, because you just got crushed

862
00:37:34.96 --> 00:37:35.96
for six weeks.

863
00:37:35.96 --> 00:37:37.96
And hopefully you learned something out of it.

864
00:37:37.96 --> 00:37:41.48
And you're supposed to take that back and teach the guys in your squadron all those

865
00:37:41.48 --> 00:37:42.48
same lessons.

866
00:37:42.48 --> 00:37:44.96
And so my expectation was I was going to go back from top gun.

867
00:37:44.96 --> 00:37:49.52
I was going to spend another two years, 18 months in the squadron as a kind of the senior

868
00:37:49.52 --> 00:37:50.52
instructors.

869
00:37:50.52 --> 00:37:52.28
And then go on to something else.

870
00:37:52.28 --> 00:37:56.36
And I didn't know exactly what that was at the time.

871
00:37:56.36 --> 00:37:57.52
But as I'm leaving, no joke.

872
00:37:57.52 --> 00:38:01.16
My last day, I remember the guy who asked me, is actually the same guy that's going

873
00:38:01.16 --> 00:38:02.64
to do my retirement here in a couple months.

874
00:38:02.64 --> 00:38:07.48
I came out of you, thought about coming back to being instructor top gun after this

875
00:38:07.48 --> 00:38:09.56
tour in your squadron's over.

876
00:38:09.56 --> 00:38:12.76
And I try to play a cool, like, oh, let me go home and think about that.

877
00:38:12.76 --> 00:38:16.80
But clearly, there wasn't a lot to think about there.

878
00:38:16.80 --> 00:38:19.96
So I left there with kind of an inclination that I might get asked back.

879
00:38:19.96 --> 00:38:21.32
And I was pretty stoked about that.

880
00:38:21.32 --> 00:38:22.56
They didn't formalize it.

881
00:38:22.56 --> 00:38:27.36
But he was a senior IP on the staff, the senior Marine there as well.

882
00:38:27.36 --> 00:38:29.28
A real respected guy in Marine aviation.

883
00:38:29.28 --> 00:38:30.28
And he had given me a sit down.

884
00:38:30.28 --> 00:38:32.32
So I was hoping that that was going to happen.

885
00:38:32.32 --> 00:38:33.48
But I also thought I had time.

886
00:38:33.48 --> 00:38:36.36
I thought I was, this is July 2001.

887
00:38:36.36 --> 00:38:40.76
And obviously six weeks later, 9-11 hits.

888
00:38:40.76 --> 00:38:42.64
And so all that calculus kind of changed.

889
00:38:42.64 --> 00:38:47.28
And very quickly, my squadron, which was on this regular cycle of preparing to go to,

890
00:38:47.28 --> 00:38:51.12
what was going to be another Southern Watch deployment, just like we did, that whole thing

891
00:38:51.12 --> 00:38:53.44
had changed.

892
00:38:53.44 --> 00:38:55.96
Because of September 11th.

893
00:38:55.96 --> 00:38:58.16
So what happens on September 11th for you?

894
00:38:58.16 --> 00:39:03.52
Yeah, you were active in a squadron getting ready for work in the morning.

895
00:39:03.52 --> 00:39:04.52
Totally.

896
00:39:04.52 --> 00:39:06.20
I'm stationed right up the road here.

897
00:39:06.20 --> 00:39:08.40
Five miles north of the air is a ringer station, Miramar.

898
00:39:08.40 --> 00:39:13.72
I'm on my second half of my first tour as a pilot and a 182-ajron.

899
00:39:13.72 --> 00:39:15.04
I'd already done that one deployment.

900
00:39:15.04 --> 00:39:17.04
And I had a routine down.

901
00:39:17.04 --> 00:39:18.04
I was getting up.

902
00:39:18.04 --> 00:39:20.32
I was probably, I guess it was probably five in the morning.

903
00:39:20.32 --> 00:39:22.04
I'm sitting at the foot of my bed, listening to my boots.

904
00:39:22.04 --> 00:39:25.56
I could did every day to just get in the car and drive into work and click on the TV.

905
00:39:25.56 --> 00:39:31.56
And I see, we've stayed at a clock back east around that time and I see what's going on.

906
00:39:31.56 --> 00:39:34.20
And I think, you know, same story for all this kind of piece of together very quickly.

907
00:39:34.20 --> 00:39:35.20
Hey, this is an accident.

908
00:39:35.20 --> 00:39:36.20
This is something's really happening.

909
00:39:36.20 --> 00:39:37.92
You can see the second building.

910
00:39:37.92 --> 00:39:42.72
And it, very quickly, kind of, clicks in like, this is the real thing.

911
00:39:42.72 --> 00:39:45.32
And I knew, I knew we were going to go to war.

912
00:39:45.32 --> 00:39:48.16
I didn't know what, I obviously didn't know the details, but I knew things were going

913
00:39:48.16 --> 00:39:49.56
to change really dramatically.

914
00:39:49.56 --> 00:39:53.64
As a matter of fact, my drive to work, which normally would have taken me 10 minutes or

915
00:39:53.64 --> 00:39:57.32
never 15 minutes, something short drive to get up into the base.

916
00:39:57.32 --> 00:40:01.16
It was like three hours to get on the base, you know, they're inspecting it, reviical, you know,

917
00:40:01.16 --> 00:40:05.96
every car getting pulled over, dodgers, you know, the whole nine yards that just the security.

918
00:40:05.96 --> 00:40:07.44
It was pretty chaotic.

919
00:40:07.44 --> 00:40:09.40
He was kind of mayhem.

920
00:40:09.40 --> 00:40:14.08
And I drive into my squadron and half of my squadron had already not half, but a good number

921
00:40:14.08 --> 00:40:17.72
of guys that already been up to Fallen, which was where we're going to go for training.

922
00:40:17.72 --> 00:40:21.12
The same place the top one is, it was just part of a normal training cycle.

923
00:40:21.12 --> 00:40:26.000
My squadron commander at the time, an awesome guy called me because he'd gone up there.

924
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.28
And I was supposed to bring the, you know, be part of the second half of that went up there.

925
00:40:29.28 --> 00:40:32.20
He's like, hey man, you need to go brief.

926
00:40:32.20 --> 00:40:35.80
You're going to be the lead of a foreship of aircraft.

927
00:40:35.80 --> 00:40:38.52
We don't know all the details yet, but we're going to, they're going to call you, they're

928
00:40:38.52 --> 00:40:39.72
going to find live ordinance.

929
00:40:39.72 --> 00:40:44.04
And you're going to have to fly an air patrol, a common air patrol mission called

930
00:40:44.04 --> 00:40:48.20
of the cap, because there are still a bunch of airliners that were still airborne coming

931
00:40:48.20 --> 00:40:52.44
in from places like Japan and Korea these long haul, you know, 12, 13, 14, our flights.

932
00:40:52.44 --> 00:40:54.52
There's a whole bunch of airplanes airborne.

933
00:40:54.52 --> 00:40:58.32
And we didn't know if those, there's potential issue with those airplanes.

934
00:40:58.32 --> 00:41:01.80
You know, if they're going to try to do the same thing back east of the day, that west, total

935
00:41:01.80 --> 00:41:02.80
chaos.

936
00:41:02.80 --> 00:41:06.96
And I had just recently graduated from Topkins, so I was like, hey, you're the lead.

937
00:41:06.96 --> 00:41:08.64
And we didn't have a good, we didn't know what the mission was.

938
00:41:08.64 --> 00:41:13.16
I mean, it was basically one of those things where we're supposed to get airborne and somehow

939
00:41:13.16 --> 00:41:16.52
between us and some other control, we're going to kind of determine if a particular aircraft

940
00:41:16.52 --> 00:41:17.84
might have been a threat.

941
00:41:17.84 --> 00:41:19.52
And now has happened all over the country.

942
00:41:19.52 --> 00:41:23.80
People were in their aircraft Air Force Navy Marine pilots who were just launching to do

943
00:41:23.80 --> 00:41:28.96
these protection missions of what ended becoming something called Operation Noble Eagle,

944
00:41:28.96 --> 00:41:30.32
which started on September 11th.

945
00:41:30.32 --> 00:41:35.52
And it was this aviation overwatch of key cities and key locations.

946
00:41:35.52 --> 00:41:37.32
And we were totally clueless on what that was.

947
00:41:37.32 --> 00:41:40.96
Now, I ended up not launching, but it didn't happen.

948
00:41:40.96 --> 00:41:43.60
You know, but we did the brief, we were getting ready to go.

949
00:41:43.60 --> 00:41:49.48
It was just kind of that moment of chaos of we were on our heels and talking didn't prepare

950
00:41:49.48 --> 00:41:50.48
me for that.

951
00:41:50.48 --> 00:41:55.28
I didn't have a sense of what it was to do with an airliner, you know, filled with civilians

952
00:41:55.28 --> 00:41:58.64
on some route coming from Japan and trying to figure out what I would do.

953
00:41:58.64 --> 00:42:01.76
If somebody said, hey, that aircraft, we've figured out that aircraft is going to try

954
00:42:01.76 --> 00:42:05.04
to fly into a building or crash into an airport or something like that.

955
00:42:05.04 --> 00:42:09.96
It was just, you know, just kind of mayhem and it was, you know, it's tough to start off.

956
00:42:09.96 --> 00:42:15.56
The idea being that if that is suspected of happening or they can somehow confirm that's

957
00:42:15.56 --> 00:42:21.20
going to happen, then you or one of your mates is going to have to shoot down a civilian

958
00:42:21.20 --> 00:42:22.20
aircraft.

959
00:42:22.20 --> 00:42:23.20
That's what they're thinking.

960
00:42:23.20 --> 00:42:24.20
Yeah, exactly.

961
00:42:24.20 --> 00:42:27.60
And that was something I never considered.

962
00:42:27.60 --> 00:42:30.84
Um, you know, there's anybody to consider that at that point.

963
00:42:30.84 --> 00:42:33.96
And I've read there's some, you know, there's some pilots that actually ended up launching

964
00:42:33.96 --> 00:42:34.96
out in the East Coast.

965
00:42:34.96 --> 00:42:38.84
I've read a couple articles of pilots that took off in their F-16s here in DC, because

966
00:42:38.84 --> 00:42:44.24
obviously it was with the Pentagon up in DC in the New York City that actually did get airborne

967
00:42:44.24 --> 00:42:47.36
and they had missions to do exactly that.

968
00:42:47.36 --> 00:42:50.84
Um, so in some sense, I was pretty lucky that I didn't have to go through that calculus,

969
00:42:50.84 --> 00:42:53.76
but I still can picture where I'm sitting, given that brief with three other pilots, kind

970
00:42:53.76 --> 00:42:56.04
of like we're sitting today.

971
00:42:56.04 --> 00:43:00.20
And we're even asking ourselves, like, well, how do you, I mean, how do you shoot down an

972
00:43:00.20 --> 00:43:01.20
airline?

973
00:43:01.20 --> 00:43:03.56
You know, what, what would we actually go through to do?

974
00:43:03.56 --> 00:43:07.40
How do we determine, you know, when we were talking, kind of trying to talk through that

975
00:43:07.40 --> 00:43:12.44
and the idea that an airliner filled with civilians, and we knew, you know, at that

976
00:43:12.44 --> 00:43:15.92
point that those other airliners are regular commercial airplanes that just took off,

977
00:43:15.92 --> 00:43:19.36
they're going their flight and they crash, we knew everybody on board, you know, nobody's

978
00:43:19.36 --> 00:43:20.36
going to survive that.

979
00:43:20.36 --> 00:43:25.16
And so it was just a very strange way to start what ended up being kind of a cycle of war

980
00:43:25.16 --> 00:43:29.36
that, you know, we've all been through for years now, that morning of getting that call

981
00:43:29.36 --> 00:43:30.76
from the CO, hey, this is what you're doing.

982
00:43:30.76 --> 00:43:33.04
And, you know, that was the beginning.

983
00:43:33.04 --> 00:43:37.42
Shortly, very shortly that route within a day or two, no, actually, I think probably that

984
00:43:37.42 --> 00:43:42.08
late afternoon, and certainly by the next day, my squadron was one of the several squadrons

985
00:43:42.08 --> 00:43:43.72
that was tasked to go back out on the carrier.

986
00:43:43.72 --> 00:43:45.28
So we split the squadron in half.

987
00:43:45.28 --> 00:43:50.40
That same CO that called me, he took guys from Fallon flew onto the ship onto the carrier,

988
00:43:50.40 --> 00:43:52.52
right off the coast of LAX.

989
00:43:52.52 --> 00:43:54.56
And I still, we, we talked about this.

990
00:43:54.56 --> 00:43:55.56
I can picture to this day.

991
00:43:55.56 --> 00:44:00.24
I took off at San Diego and flying overhead, Los Angeles International Airport, and we had guys

992
00:44:00.24 --> 00:44:04.32
that taken off in the carrier that had life missiles, and they were doing a cap, and I'm

993
00:44:04.32 --> 00:44:08.84
flying, you know, kind of opposite direction overhead, LAX looking down, and, you know,

994
00:44:08.84 --> 00:44:12.44
I grew up in San Diego, where LAX, like one of the busiest airports in the world, planes

995
00:44:12.44 --> 00:44:16.28
all over the tarmac on the runways, on the taxiways, because there's, everybody landed,

996
00:44:16.28 --> 00:44:17.28
nobody took off.

997
00:44:17.28 --> 00:44:18.60
There's no controllers.

998
00:44:18.60 --> 00:44:22.52
And they're doing this cap mission, where they're just flying overhead, LAX, kind

999
00:44:22.52 --> 00:44:27.000
of largely unknown what's going on, and just that moment of seriality of, I'm airborne.

1000
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.72
And there's nobody else flying.

1001
00:44:29.72 --> 00:44:33.12
And we're just sort of just waiting for something to happen, and, you know, it's kind

1002
00:44:33.12 --> 00:44:37.88
of one of those, hey, you'll get more specific instructions as we figure it out.

1003
00:44:37.88 --> 00:44:40.80
You know, the leadership was, was scrambling, everybody's much as we were, and kind of

1004
00:44:40.80 --> 00:44:44.68
looking down, thinking this is, this is a whole new world.

1005
00:44:44.68 --> 00:44:48.96
You know, this is not Southern Watch, you know, that mission we've been doing.

1006
00:44:48.96 --> 00:44:53.84
And within, maybe six weeks, we, we steamed out.

1007
00:44:53.84 --> 00:44:57.64
We, we, we loaded the carrier a couple months early, put the squadron, the whole air wing,

1008
00:44:57.64 --> 00:45:02.08
got on board the, the carrier and steamed out towards the North of the Rivian Gulf to go

1009
00:45:02.08 --> 00:45:05.88
do what we call it as Operation during Freedom.

1010
00:45:05.88 --> 00:45:09.64
So late 2001, I think it was maybe November of 2001.

1011
00:45:09.64 --> 00:45:11.36
We were going to war.

1012
00:45:11.36 --> 00:45:13.36
And our Afghanistan was where the war was.

1013
00:45:13.36 --> 00:45:15.16
You remember at the time, that was it.

1014
00:45:15.16 --> 00:45:16.36
There was nothing else going on.

1015
00:45:16.36 --> 00:45:17.72
We went to Afghanistan.

1016
00:45:17.72 --> 00:45:24.40
So I did a seven month cruise on a carrier from November of 2001.

1017
00:45:24.40 --> 00:45:30.48
I think we came back April May of 2002 and did combat operations over Afghanistan.

1018
00:45:30.48 --> 00:45:32.20
And, you know, a lot more rewarding.

1019
00:45:32.20 --> 00:45:34.32
And so a lot of this year, we did a mission at the time.

1020
00:45:34.32 --> 00:45:35.32
It was called Operation Anaconda.

1021
00:45:35.32 --> 00:45:36.84
I think I'm going to ask you about that.

1022
00:45:36.84 --> 00:45:38.40
That was like the largest ground offensive.

1023
00:45:38.40 --> 00:45:39.40
Yeah.

1024
00:45:39.40 --> 00:45:41.68
We had supported this desert storm.

1025
00:45:41.68 --> 00:45:48.04
And when we came back in April, April, May of 2002, we thought we'd sort of largely

1026
00:45:48.04 --> 00:45:49.04
won the war.

1027
00:45:49.04 --> 00:45:50.84
We, we thought we'd accomplished most of our mission.

1028
00:45:50.84 --> 00:45:54.88
We left thinking, hey, this thing is winding down. We're feeling pretty good about it.

1029
00:45:54.88 --> 00:45:59.48
And when I got back in May of 2002, I kind of distinctly remember, like, I just had my

1030
00:45:59.48 --> 00:46:00.48
work experience.

1031
00:46:00.48 --> 00:46:03.60
You know, as a pilot in combat, and you know, I'd done so to watch, but obviously, you

1032
00:46:03.60 --> 00:46:04.60
know, nothing like this.

1033
00:46:04.60 --> 00:46:07.000
And, but I'd done a combat deployment off of carrier.

1034
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.24
You're supported troops on the ground and Afghanistan dropping bombs and flying off

1035
00:46:11.24 --> 00:46:12.24
cars.

1036
00:46:12.24 --> 00:46:13.24
I kind of thought that was it.

1037
00:46:13.24 --> 00:46:14.24
I think a lot of us did.

1038
00:46:14.24 --> 00:46:16.24
Yeah, a lot of us did.

1039
00:46:16.24 --> 00:46:19.24
I know I thought that might come back from my first deployment to Iraq.

1040
00:46:19.24 --> 00:46:24.08
I was kind of, you know, I'm thankful that I got to do this deployment.

1041
00:46:24.08 --> 00:46:26.28
And I thought they can't go on that much longer.

1042
00:46:26.28 --> 00:46:30.92
But I mean, really quickly, after we got back, it spiraled and I said, oh, this is going

1043
00:46:30.92 --> 00:46:31.92
to be a while.

1044
00:46:31.92 --> 00:46:33.92
Yeah, big time.

1045
00:46:33.92 --> 00:46:38.72
You know, while I was on that deployment, I had gotten email from Top Gun.

1046
00:46:38.72 --> 00:46:42.08
I was saying, hey, I want to come up here next summer, being a structure.

1047
00:46:42.08 --> 00:46:47.000
So I came back in May of that deployment, knowing that my next step was going to go back

1048
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
up to Fallen.

1049
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.32
I was feeling pretty good about that.

1050
00:46:50.32 --> 00:46:52.72
I was pretty pumped to know what was next.

1051
00:46:52.72 --> 00:46:58.04
And, you know, in that period of time, it came back, you know, I'm packing up that summer

1052
00:46:58.04 --> 00:47:02.84
and moving out in the fall and already the gears are starting to turn for what end to

1053
00:47:02.84 --> 00:47:04.44
be an operation Iraqi freedom.

1054
00:47:04.44 --> 00:47:07.24
You know, it's the writing is on the wall that this is, we're not done.

1055
00:47:07.24 --> 00:47:08.60
I mean, we're really just getting started.

1056
00:47:08.60 --> 00:47:11.04
And it was several months before that I'll kick off.

1057
00:47:11.04 --> 00:47:15.44
I think everybody in the military certainly knew this is which way it's going to happen.

1058
00:47:15.44 --> 00:47:18.12
And I think there are some things along the way that we're supposed to occur.

1059
00:47:18.12 --> 00:47:20.12
But we all knew this was coming.

1060
00:47:20.12 --> 00:47:23.08
Certainly, you know, it kicked off in March of the fall of the year.

1061
00:47:23.08 --> 00:47:25.24
It wasn't a big surprise to any of us.

1062
00:47:25.24 --> 00:47:26.24
And I was up at Fallen.

1063
00:47:26.24 --> 00:47:30.32
Kind of watching that whole thing roll and I realized that that deployment that I just

1064
00:47:30.32 --> 00:47:34.76
finished was not the end of what we were doing as a country and trying to deal with this

1065
00:47:34.76 --> 00:47:35.76
problem.

1066
00:47:35.76 --> 00:47:40.36
And then you show up at Top Gun to be an instructor, which is, you know, you said the

1067
00:47:40.36 --> 00:47:42.72
going to Top Gun was like a masters.

1068
00:47:42.72 --> 00:47:45.60
And so now it's beyond a doctorate, right?

1069
00:47:45.60 --> 00:47:46.60
I mean, it's.

1070
00:47:46.60 --> 00:47:48.08
Yeah, and we say it's the PhD.

1071
00:47:48.08 --> 00:47:52.96
I mean, in our business, certainly is a for a Marine or naval aviator of fighter pilot.

1072
00:47:52.96 --> 00:47:53.96
That's it.

1073
00:47:53.96 --> 00:47:56.76
Top Gun kind of represents the schoolhouse.

1074
00:47:56.76 --> 00:47:58.92
It's the place where you want to be.

1075
00:47:58.92 --> 00:48:01.56
And as an instructor, you have a huge amount of responsibility.

1076
00:48:01.56 --> 00:48:04.48
It's a bunch of sort of mid career guys.

1077
00:48:04.48 --> 00:48:05.48
It's Navy Lieutenant.

1078
00:48:05.48 --> 00:48:06.92
It's Marine Corps captains.

1079
00:48:06.92 --> 00:48:09.12
Maybe a junior major or a junior lieutenant commander.

1080
00:48:09.12 --> 00:48:13.28
But it's run by relatively young guys.

1081
00:48:13.28 --> 00:48:16.44
As a head maybe a full deployment under the belt, you know, quickly guys were coming

1082
00:48:16.44 --> 00:48:18.24
and having done Afghanistan, combat operations.

1083
00:48:18.24 --> 00:48:21.04
Guys coming having done Iraq, combat operations.

1084
00:48:21.04 --> 00:48:26.24
So in the time that I was there from O2 to O5, the combat experience on the staff went

1085
00:48:26.24 --> 00:48:29.68
from basically none to everybody.

1086
00:48:29.68 --> 00:48:30.68
Everybody.

1087
00:48:30.68 --> 00:48:31.68
Every single dude had been in combat.

1088
00:48:31.68 --> 00:48:35.44
It was coming off a long deployment where they had done back to back to POMISI, Iraq

1089
00:48:35.44 --> 00:48:36.44
and Afghanistan.

1090
00:48:36.44 --> 00:48:39.44
Guys that I knew had done 10 month deployments to Iraq on a carrier.

1091
00:48:39.44 --> 00:48:45.72
I mean, really seasoned guys where just one generation to three years prior, not a single

1092
00:48:45.72 --> 00:48:48.20
person on the staff had seen any combat like that.

1093
00:48:48.20 --> 00:48:52.20
So these acts same thing in the sealed teams we experienced, exact same thing.

1094
00:48:52.20 --> 00:48:57.56
Going from zero or close to zero combat experiencing that it's an odd guy that had done

1095
00:48:57.56 --> 00:49:03.56
little operation here there to every single guy except for the new guys.

1096
00:49:03.56 --> 00:49:06.20
And then, but you're learning curve.

1097
00:49:06.20 --> 00:49:09.40
When you show back up there, it was just as steep as the first time.

1098
00:49:09.40 --> 00:49:10.40
Yeah, without a doubt.

1099
00:49:10.40 --> 00:49:15.12
So when you're there as a student and you don't understand a lot of what's going on

1100
00:49:15.12 --> 00:49:17.96
as a student, at least on the instructor side, you know, they're not trying to keep anything

1101
00:49:17.96 --> 00:49:22.12
from me, but you're just, you were so busy just trying to keep your head above water.

1102
00:49:22.12 --> 00:49:25.72
You're not spending a lot of time wondering what the instructors are doing at the free time.

1103
00:49:25.72 --> 00:49:31.40
You're just prepping for every brief, the flight may take an hour, but you've put in

1104
00:49:31.40 --> 00:49:35.08
10 hours of work ahead of time and you've debrief for six hours and when you're done,

1105
00:49:35.08 --> 00:49:37.44
you need to go start the next prep process again for you.

1106
00:49:37.44 --> 00:49:43.44
So you are just all day, every day thinking about your next flight and getting ready for

1107
00:49:43.44 --> 00:49:44.56
that and the thing is going on.

1108
00:49:44.56 --> 00:49:48.80
So in your learning curve as steep as a student, when you get there as an instructor

1109
00:49:48.80 --> 00:49:51.000
and I didn't know this at the time, you get there.

1110
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.52
When you're there as an instructor, you have certainly been selected to a pretty elite

1111
00:49:55.52 --> 00:50:02.04
group of folks, but you don't teach a student at Topkin when you're an instructor for a year.

1112
00:50:02.04 --> 00:50:05.000
They spend an entire year with you as an instructor.

1113
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.16
There's only 25 guys on the staff.

1114
00:50:07.16 --> 00:50:10.88
So a third of you basically, if you kind of do the math or sequester for an entire year,

1115
00:50:10.88 --> 00:50:14.16
just going through what's called, we call it the IUT, the instructor under training.

1116
00:50:14.16 --> 00:50:18.20
And they're just teaching you how to teach students.

1117
00:50:18.20 --> 00:50:23.04
And in that year, you're now flying all these different training missions with the instructors

1118
00:50:23.04 --> 00:50:27.72
that are training you to be instructor and you're getting annihilated again.

1119
00:50:27.72 --> 00:50:31.52
So that whole continuum of, well, I'm pretty good.

1120
00:50:31.52 --> 00:50:32.72
You were reminded very quickly.

1121
00:50:32.72 --> 00:50:34.16
And so it takes an entire year.

1122
00:50:34.16 --> 00:50:37.48
And now the good news about that is that by the time you're finishing your initial instructor

1123
00:50:37.48 --> 00:50:40.56
qualification, you can go teach students.

1124
00:50:40.56 --> 00:50:44.04
You have been flying more than you've ever flown in your territory.

1125
00:50:44.04 --> 00:50:48.000
I mean, I'm flying two, three times a day sometimes for a year.

1126
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.92
And so you're just getting reps and reps and reps.

1127
00:50:50.92 --> 00:50:54.16
And you have got more reps, I think, than anybody in aviation.

1128
00:50:54.16 --> 00:50:57.92
So when the time you get your first student is sitting down, you're very first student brief.

1129
00:50:57.92 --> 00:51:00.64
Your A game has been elevated, you know, quite a bit.

1130
00:51:00.64 --> 00:51:05.64
And you're able to fly with the students and teach them way more effective week as,

1131
00:51:05.64 --> 00:51:07.88
when I finished top gun, I went to Afghanistan.

1132
00:51:07.88 --> 00:51:10.88
I didn't do a single air to air mission for almost a year.

1133
00:51:10.88 --> 00:51:11.68
I was dropping bombs.

1134
00:51:11.68 --> 00:51:14.12
I was doing cast and, oh, those are other type of missions.

1135
00:51:14.12 --> 00:51:18.64
So when I got there, I was, I was pretty rusty on the skill sets.

1136
00:51:18.64 --> 00:51:21.64
A year of flying with instructors will resolve that.

1137
00:51:21.64 --> 00:51:22.64
Pretty much.

1138
00:51:22.64 --> 00:51:27.64
Just the amount of flying that you get, you know, in just a week called Matt time.

1139
00:51:27.64 --> 00:51:32.40
But for a normal pilot, you're not even getting a fraction of that, right?

1140
00:51:32.40 --> 00:51:33.40
A fraction.

1141
00:51:33.40 --> 00:51:38.20
Not only you're not getting a fraction of it, a lot of the time that you're flying is when

1142
00:51:38.20 --> 00:51:41.80
you're not a top gun is, you know, sometimes you do an admin flying just flying two

1143
00:51:41.80 --> 00:51:42.80
and from different places.

1144
00:51:42.80 --> 00:51:45.64
Sometimes you're just prepping for a very particular mission.

1145
00:51:45.64 --> 00:51:49.56
You know, it takes a skill to, you know, the missions are getting ready to drop bombs or do

1146
00:51:49.56 --> 00:51:52.28
armor, condits, and so different types of flying.

1147
00:51:52.28 --> 00:51:53.88
You don't get to see all of it.

1148
00:51:53.88 --> 00:51:56.04
You get to see a pretty narrow amount of top gun.

1149
00:51:56.04 --> 00:51:59.24
You get exposed to everything repeatedly.

1150
00:51:59.24 --> 00:52:02.96
And so that one against one that we talked about, that we call BFM, basic fighter maneuvers,

1151
00:52:02.96 --> 00:52:06.52
which is just you and another guy fighting two airplanes.

1152
00:52:06.52 --> 00:52:10.88
You do that a ton, but you do all the other things just as much.

1153
00:52:10.88 --> 00:52:15.64
So you get exposed to the PhD part of it isn't just the reps.

1154
00:52:15.64 --> 00:52:17.04
I think that's critical.

1155
00:52:17.04 --> 00:52:21.12
But it's that you get exposed to this nuanced part of aviation that you just didn't even

1156
00:52:21.12 --> 00:52:22.20
really know existed.

1157
00:52:22.20 --> 00:52:26.72
So you get all the science, all the math, all the things that drive us to say this, why

1158
00:52:26.72 --> 00:52:31.80
would do the things we do, then just get to practice it over and over and then you go back

1159
00:52:31.80 --> 00:52:33.72
to the science and go, hey, I think there's some flaws here.

1160
00:52:33.72 --> 00:52:34.72
Maybe some differences here.

1161
00:52:34.72 --> 00:52:37.20
And the guys at top, kind of the one writing the manual.

1162
00:52:37.20 --> 00:52:43.000
We literally write a manual for inches thick of all these different chapters of how to fly

1163
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000
the airplane.

1164
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.14
Everything from doing the one against one to dropping a bomb to mission planning, top

1165
00:52:47.14 --> 00:52:48.14
gun owns that.

1166
00:52:48.14 --> 00:52:53.86
Even a chapter in a book and a lecture that I was responsible for and the thing that was

1167
00:52:53.86 --> 00:52:58.02
pretty amazing for me is when I got there, the mission set that I was responsible for

1168
00:52:58.02 --> 00:53:02.82
my, my smear area, my subject matter, X-ray area was surface air threat and counter tactics.

1169
00:53:02.82 --> 00:53:06.66
So I was the guy as a captain in the Marine Corps that was responsible for writing the

1170
00:53:06.66 --> 00:53:11.82
chapter teaching the lecture and establishing our tactics for how to defeat threat surface

1171
00:53:11.82 --> 00:53:14.14
air missiles in AAA.

1172
00:53:14.14 --> 00:53:22.20
This was from September of 2002 to March 2003 that I was the guy that established the

1173
00:53:22.20 --> 00:53:25.26
Navy Marine Corps's procedures and techniques and how we did that and taught that.

1174
00:53:25.26 --> 00:53:29.10
So you know, I'm sorry, oh, I have kicks off.

1175
00:53:29.10 --> 00:53:32.98
You know, guys that I'm, I had fun with and trained with or out there on deployments

1176
00:53:32.98 --> 00:53:33.98
or write me letters.

1177
00:53:33.98 --> 00:53:35.30
Hey, we're seeing this threat.

1178
00:53:35.30 --> 00:53:36.30
What should we do here?

1179
00:53:36.30 --> 00:53:39.70
You know, buddies of mine that I've grown up in aviation, I'm saying, hey, this is what

1180
00:53:39.70 --> 00:53:40.70
we should do.

1181
00:53:40.70 --> 00:53:42.66
This is how you should do with this particular case.

1182
00:53:42.66 --> 00:53:47.22
So the responsibility as an IP, I think why is such a PhD type program is that your

1183
00:53:47.22 --> 00:53:50.58
level responsibility grows, you have to be more than just a good pilot.

1184
00:53:50.58 --> 00:53:54.74
You can teach anybody a good pilot, but if you can't teach and explain to other guys what

1185
00:53:54.74 --> 00:53:57.78
they're doing and how to get better and how to keep themselves alive, you're kind of useless

1186
00:53:57.78 --> 00:53:59.10
in combat.

1187
00:53:59.10 --> 00:54:03.74
So it was a, it was, it was the best way or some of my life, man.

1188
00:54:03.74 --> 00:54:05.74
It was, it was ridiculous.

1189
00:54:05.74 --> 00:54:08.86
And we just flew every day, two, three times a day.

1190
00:54:08.86 --> 00:54:10.18
I got qualified in the F-16.

1191
00:54:10.18 --> 00:54:11.66
I got to fly a totally different airplane.

1192
00:54:11.66 --> 00:54:17.54
So I was dual-qualled in an F-18 and an NF-16 as a Marine on a Navy base at a Navy command

1193
00:54:17.54 --> 00:54:19.66
after having done two deployments on carriers.

1194
00:54:19.66 --> 00:54:21.82
I mean, you cannot.

1195
00:54:21.82 --> 00:54:25.62
It'd be like if I said, I need you to do jujitsu three days, two times a day, every day

1196
00:54:25.62 --> 00:54:27.62
for three years.

1197
00:54:27.62 --> 00:54:28.98
And you need, and that's all I need you to do.

1198
00:54:28.98 --> 00:54:30.30
I don't need you to do anything else.

1199
00:54:30.30 --> 00:54:31.30
Yeah.

1200
00:54:31.30 --> 00:54:35.78
You know, I've actually done a Baxy ride in F-18 at Fowl and as a matter of fact.

1201
00:54:35.78 --> 00:54:39.98
And one of the things that I think is important to understand, or at least from my perspective,

1202
00:54:39.98 --> 00:54:44.18
one of the things that made it really cool was when you get an F-18, if you've never been

1203
00:54:44.18 --> 00:54:46.94
in one, most people, you're not going to get the chance to get an F-18.

1204
00:54:46.94 --> 00:54:47.94
And fly with it, right?

1205
00:54:47.94 --> 00:54:51.22
So I'll give a little description of what I thought was one of the coolest parts about it.

1206
00:54:51.22 --> 00:54:57.82
Is that if you look at the structure of an F-18, the, the, the pod that you sit in, the cockpit,

1207
00:54:57.82 --> 00:55:02.46
is really far forward and the wings and the engine and our stuff are behind you.

1208
00:55:02.46 --> 00:55:07.18
And it looks that way when you look at it, but when you get in it, you, those, those wings

1209
00:55:07.18 --> 00:55:11.94
are so far behind you that you feel like you're in a superhero pod.

1210
00:55:11.94 --> 00:55:15.10
You need to turn, you need to turn hard.

1211
00:55:15.10 --> 00:55:20.26
You can't just look back to see the wings and it's a glass canopy that surrounds you.

1212
00:55:20.26 --> 00:55:27.82
So you feel like you're just in a little pod that is moving at whatever, 800 miles an hour.

1213
00:55:27.82 --> 00:55:29.74
And it's, it's, it's a, it's a crazy feeling.

1214
00:55:29.74 --> 00:55:35.06
It's a crazy feeling because, because you're, it's deceiving because you just feel like you're

1215
00:55:35.06 --> 00:55:37.22
in this little space pod.

1216
00:55:37.22 --> 00:55:39.42
Somehow Star Wars powering through the air.

1217
00:55:39.42 --> 00:55:43.70
You don't realize it behind you is, you know, tons of metal and machinery that's making

1218
00:55:43.70 --> 00:55:44.70
this happen.

1219
00:55:44.70 --> 00:55:47.26
And the G-force isn't all that stuff.

1220
00:55:47.26 --> 00:55:51.70
It's, it's, it's, it's a very cool, very cool thing to experience.

1221
00:55:51.70 --> 00:55:53.86
For me, I, I thought, yeah, that was awesome.

1222
00:55:53.86 --> 00:55:56.38
I didn't think to myself, man, I should have been a pilot.

1223
00:55:56.38 --> 00:56:00.82
There's some, there's some, I know you, we were talking about it yesterday.

1224
00:56:00.82 --> 00:56:06.26
For you, the connection between man and machine is a really cool thing that you enjoy.

1225
00:56:06.26 --> 00:56:08.74
For me, I don't like it.

1226
00:56:08.74 --> 00:56:11.06
I don't like to rely on a machine.

1227
00:56:11.06 --> 00:56:12.06
Yeah.

1228
00:56:12.06 --> 00:56:15.18
I don't even, even get in Bradley's and stuff and Romadi, I always think, you know, I mean,

1229
00:56:15.18 --> 00:56:17.98
I always was apprehensive about a big machine that I had to rely on.

1230
00:56:17.98 --> 00:56:19.66
I don't want to rely on me.

1231
00:56:19.66 --> 00:56:24.82
And what I could do, and that's why I had that little disconnect, I always, I still have

1232
00:56:24.82 --> 00:56:27.50
it today, you know, that's why I'm waiting for the robot works.

1233
00:56:27.50 --> 00:56:30.06
I want, I want to fight those things.

1234
00:56:30.06 --> 00:56:36.46
So I just have a little disconnect with the machines, but I can see where people that

1235
00:56:36.46 --> 00:56:38.14
are, I have that type of mindset.

1236
00:56:38.14 --> 00:56:41.74
It's just, you know, it's just a complete equalizer as you were telling me last night.

1237
00:56:41.74 --> 00:56:44.14
You're just like, it's a stock car race.

1238
00:56:44.14 --> 00:56:50.14
It's you in the same plane as me and who is better is going to win.

1239
00:56:50.14 --> 00:56:51.14
Period.

1240
00:56:51.14 --> 00:56:52.14
That's it.

1241
00:56:52.14 --> 00:56:53.42
There's really no excuses you can make.

1242
00:56:53.42 --> 00:56:55.38
Yeah, that's one of my favorite things.

1243
00:56:55.38 --> 00:56:59.74
It's always been one of my favorite things about flying fighters is that it's an equalizer.

1244
00:56:59.74 --> 00:57:03.82
You don't get, you don't bring any advantage to that airplane.

1245
00:57:03.82 --> 00:57:07.02
Now if we're going to train something, you made, there's guys that are bigger, the guys

1246
00:57:07.02 --> 00:57:08.02
that are better aren't right.

1247
00:57:08.02 --> 00:57:09.02
They got whatever.

1248
00:57:09.02 --> 00:57:14.66
There's a whole bunch of ways that maybe you can bring an advantage.

1249
00:57:14.66 --> 00:57:15.66
You lose all that.

1250
00:57:15.66 --> 00:57:16.66
They've been used to it on that airplane.

1251
00:57:16.66 --> 00:57:18.38
Because you're only going to go as fast as the airplane goes.

1252
00:57:18.38 --> 00:57:19.50
You don't even pull as many jeezes.

1253
00:57:19.50 --> 00:57:20.50
The airplane pulls.

1254
00:57:20.50 --> 00:57:21.66
That's what you get.

1255
00:57:21.66 --> 00:57:23.66
Now, you get a lot of all that stuff.

1256
00:57:23.66 --> 00:57:24.46
I mean, it's awesome.

1257
00:57:24.46 --> 00:57:30.58
But your success or your failure is 100% about how well you interact with that machine

1258
00:57:30.58 --> 00:57:32.14
and compare to that other guy.

1259
00:57:32.14 --> 00:57:35.26
And if you lose, you know, my engine, no.

1260
00:57:35.26 --> 00:57:39.06
Well, I didn't have negative, you lost because you were worse than me today.

1261
00:57:39.06 --> 00:57:40.06
Period.

1262
00:57:40.06 --> 00:57:41.86
And look, you're going to find reasons why.

1263
00:57:41.86 --> 00:57:43.94
We record every flight.

1264
00:57:43.94 --> 00:57:46.86
We record our radar as we record our information, our display.

1265
00:57:46.86 --> 00:57:49.14
So we can go back and dissect.

1266
00:57:49.14 --> 00:57:52.62
And what you end up being able to do as an instructor is right there.

1267
00:57:52.62 --> 00:57:53.66
That's why you lost.

1268
00:57:53.66 --> 00:57:55.58
This decision you made here, this move you went.

1269
00:57:55.58 --> 00:57:57.34
You went this direction or you went up or down.

1270
00:57:57.34 --> 00:57:59.10
You decided to go this speed or whatnot.

1271
00:57:59.10 --> 00:58:01.90
You can dissect every single flight.

1272
00:58:01.90 --> 00:58:06.70
And the great instructors are the ones that can tell you, this is why I did this to you

1273
00:58:06.70 --> 00:58:07.70
in 45 seconds.

1274
00:58:07.70 --> 00:58:09.74
Because here, you made a decision.

1275
00:58:09.74 --> 00:58:11.74
And it took me this long to capitalize it.

1276
00:58:11.74 --> 00:58:15.70
But right now is where I took advantage of a mistake that you made.

1277
00:58:15.70 --> 00:58:18.90
And you freeze that mistake and you put on a TV and they see it and they look at it and

1278
00:58:18.90 --> 00:58:20.62
they burn it in their brain.

1279
00:58:20.62 --> 00:58:24.02
And they make that mistake over and over and over and over and until eventually they don't

1280
00:58:24.02 --> 00:58:25.02
make that mistake.

1281
00:58:25.02 --> 00:58:26.70
And then you start to make your money as an instructor.

1282
00:58:26.70 --> 00:58:34.10
But being an airplane, I brought every bit of capability that airplane had.

1283
00:58:34.10 --> 00:58:35.10
And I never had it.

1284
00:58:35.10 --> 00:58:37.82
There's no, you don't start at a disadvantage.

1285
00:58:37.82 --> 00:58:40.58
And if you beat somebody, they have nobody to look at.

1286
00:58:40.58 --> 00:58:41.58
No excuse.

1287
00:58:41.58 --> 00:58:43.62
Nothing to blame except for their own performance.

1288
00:58:43.62 --> 00:58:44.90
And I loved that.

1289
00:58:44.90 --> 00:58:49.22
And I will always love that about being a fighter pilot.

1290
00:58:49.22 --> 00:58:51.90
And then when you're flying to the left 16, now you have a different airplane.

1291
00:58:51.90 --> 00:58:54.26
So hey, one of the planes faster than the other.

1292
00:58:54.26 --> 00:58:55.74
One airplane actually turns better.

1293
00:58:55.74 --> 00:59:00.74
And so now instead of it just being two totally equal platforms, it's one has particular

1294
00:59:00.74 --> 00:59:03.02
strengths and weaknesses that are different than the other ones.

1295
00:59:03.02 --> 00:59:06.38
So you better be really good about avoiding his strengths and getting, you know, and

1296
00:59:06.38 --> 00:59:08.70
plan to his weaknesses and vice versa.

1297
00:59:08.70 --> 00:59:10.90
And if you lose, guess what?

1298
00:59:10.90 --> 00:59:12.22
It's still your fault.

1299
00:59:12.22 --> 00:59:17.82
100% because instead of you having two similar airplanes, you couldn't identify what he was

1300
00:59:17.82 --> 00:59:21.78
able to do better than you in his regime that he has, you know, you're strong with me

1301
00:59:21.78 --> 00:59:22.78
fine.

1302
00:59:22.78 --> 00:59:24.50
And then I'm going to try to be more agile than you.

1303
00:59:24.50 --> 00:59:25.50
You know, you're quicker than me.

1304
00:59:25.50 --> 00:59:28.54
Okay, well, I'm going to maybe try to outpower you those type of things and those games

1305
00:59:28.54 --> 00:59:31.62
that you play kind of back and forth.

1306
00:59:31.62 --> 00:59:34.70
There is no question at the end of a flight at Top Gun that you're fighting another

1307
00:59:34.70 --> 00:59:35.70
dude who won.

1308
00:59:35.70 --> 00:59:37.90
Nobody comes back and I wonder how I did on that one.

1309
00:59:37.90 --> 00:59:38.90
It's all very evident.

1310
00:59:38.90 --> 00:59:42.26
If you're looking over your shoulder and the guy is telling to these gunning you with his

1311
00:59:42.26 --> 00:59:45.54
airplane, you don't go back to the debrief and think, I wonder how that, I wonder how this

1312
00:59:45.54 --> 00:59:47.10
is going to play out.

1313
00:59:47.10 --> 00:59:50.66
So it's all right there, laid out the cards are always in the table.

1314
00:59:50.66 --> 00:59:53.42
There's a reason for everything while you succeeded in while you failed.

1315
00:59:53.42 --> 00:59:58.22
And I just thrived in that environment because you couldn't hide from anything.

1316
00:59:58.22 --> 01:00:00.14
Everybody saw everything and it was all right there.

1317
01:00:00.14 --> 01:00:06.66
Who good student, a really good talented student coming up to Top Gun has what percentage

1318
01:00:06.66 --> 01:00:07.62
chance of winning.

1319
01:00:07.62 --> 01:00:13.54
So if the best, let's say the high-peter to the best student that I ever saw that came to

1320
01:00:13.54 --> 01:00:18.50
Top Gun as a student from a squadron, the best student that ever came to Top Gun to fight

1321
01:00:18.50 --> 01:00:23.30
a qualified Top Gun instructor stands 0% chance of winning.

1322
01:00:23.30 --> 01:00:27.78
The best student at Top Gun has zero chance.

1323
01:00:27.78 --> 01:00:31.30
I could fall asleep in an airplane as an IP and a student is not going to be me.

1324
01:00:31.30 --> 01:00:35.54
There is just such a huge, and it doesn't even mean that we're better.

1325
01:00:35.54 --> 01:00:39.02
I don't mean to imply that we were better pilots, but you're just, you're a hat time.

1326
01:00:39.02 --> 01:00:40.02
Yep, it's just time.

1327
01:00:40.02 --> 01:00:44.06
And it's not even me that critical.

1328
01:00:44.06 --> 01:00:45.50
It's just not even close.

1329
01:00:45.50 --> 01:00:47.50
And nor would they expect it.

1330
01:00:47.50 --> 01:00:50.94
Some students, every now and then a student thinks he's going to do some good work and I

1331
01:00:50.94 --> 01:00:52.66
watch this, I'm awesome.

1332
01:00:52.66 --> 01:00:57.18
But most guys show up realizing that disparity, I understood that when I got there as a student,

1333
01:00:57.18 --> 01:00:58.98
these guys are just in a different world.

1334
01:00:58.98 --> 01:01:00.90
You want to get to that world.

1335
01:01:00.90 --> 01:01:09.98
But as an IP, if I instructor, if I flew my best jet on day one against the best

1336
01:01:09.98 --> 01:01:16.50
student, it would be over so fast that he almost wouldn't even learn as much as he should.

1337
01:01:16.50 --> 01:01:21.98
So you, you still fly your best airplane, but you make sure that there's a learning process.

1338
01:01:21.98 --> 01:01:26.30
There, if you want to just annihilate somebody at Top Gun, as you can do that, the students

1339
01:01:26.30 --> 01:01:33.70
that come there, even on their last day aren't on your same level.

1340
01:01:33.70 --> 01:01:34.70
They just aren't.

1341
01:01:34.70 --> 01:01:36.66
They've gotten a lot better than learning curve as steep.

1342
01:01:36.66 --> 01:01:40.74
But when you're in your third year as an IP at Top Gun, you've just had so many reps,

1343
01:01:40.74 --> 01:01:42.66
so many laps doing the exact same thing.

1344
01:01:42.66 --> 01:01:47.02
You've seen everything that it's almost like, we talked about this yesterday, it's almost

1345
01:01:47.02 --> 01:01:48.82
like things are happening in the slow motion for you.

1346
01:01:48.82 --> 01:01:51.78
You're in the matrix and that guy is just working as hard as he possibly can and doing

1347
01:01:51.78 --> 01:01:52.78
his thing.

1348
01:01:52.78 --> 01:01:56.62
And you're just kind of sitting there, kind of watching it at like one third speed.

1349
01:01:56.62 --> 01:02:00.22
So you're ability to decide and do something to him or do something to that airplane or make

1350
01:02:00.22 --> 01:02:02.02
a decision.

1351
01:02:02.02 --> 01:02:04.30
You're just operating in a faster pace than him.

1352
01:02:04.30 --> 01:02:06.34
And that reaction is just impossible to keep up with.

1353
01:02:06.34 --> 01:02:11.14
I can't wait to start training Jiu Jitsu because you're just going to the analogies or just

1354
01:02:11.14 --> 01:02:12.74
everywhere.

1355
01:02:12.74 --> 01:02:15.18
And that's one thing I said, Jiu Jitsu, you can see the future.

1356
01:02:15.18 --> 01:02:18.98
You can actually see the future when you're training Jiu Jitsu with someone that doesn't

1357
01:02:18.98 --> 01:02:22.18
know as much as you, you know what is going to happen.

1358
01:02:22.18 --> 01:02:24.02
You know what they are going to do.

1359
01:02:24.02 --> 01:02:27.82
Just like when you're in the cockpit and you do something and you know what that person

1360
01:02:27.82 --> 01:02:28.82
you know what they're going to do.

1361
01:02:28.82 --> 01:02:30.22
You just know it totally.

1362
01:02:30.22 --> 01:02:34.86
And don't forget too as an instructor, you've been on the receiving end of that for years

1363
01:02:34.86 --> 01:02:35.86
as well.

1364
01:02:35.86 --> 01:02:39.06
You're standing kind of both sides of that coin and you know you fly with someone and

1365
01:02:39.06 --> 01:02:42.06
you'll think you're so like, oh, I can't believe you just did that.

1366
01:02:42.06 --> 01:02:46.90
And then you know three turns later is when you get to take advantage of that because

1367
01:02:46.90 --> 01:02:50.22
you know some time we'll have to play out for his mistake to really reveal itself like

1368
01:02:50.22 --> 01:02:52.54
man, I can't believe you just did that.

1369
01:02:52.54 --> 01:02:54.86
This is going to cost you over time.

1370
01:02:54.86 --> 01:02:58.30
And you can go back on the tape like I said and say, hey, you know, you're worried about

1371
01:02:58.30 --> 01:03:00.26
what happened at the end, run behind you.

1372
01:03:00.26 --> 01:03:05.18
But what really, what let me do that was 30 seconds ago you did this.

1373
01:03:05.18 --> 01:03:09.30
And when this was the environment or the circumstances and you see that stuff and that's

1374
01:03:09.30 --> 01:03:12.34
when you talk about seeing the future, I mean, if you really want to be a jerk about it,

1375
01:03:12.34 --> 01:03:15.66
you know, if guys of your buddies, you know, I'll get in the radio like a buddy of mine.

1376
01:03:15.66 --> 01:03:18.98
I'll, students that came through but guys in my squash and like, oh, that's going to hurt.

1377
01:03:18.98 --> 01:03:21.26
And they're like, what am I, I'm like, stand by.

1378
01:03:21.26 --> 01:03:25.94
You know, in 30 seconds later you'll be gone in the guy because you see the mistakes

1379
01:03:25.94 --> 01:03:29.06
that they make and you know how that's going to play out.

1380
01:03:29.06 --> 01:03:33.94
So you are on your own playing field there as an instructor and like I said, man, it's

1381
01:03:33.94 --> 01:03:36.54
not about being better or worse.

1382
01:03:36.54 --> 01:03:41.78
It's just the time and you get so much of the time there and you get exposed to all the

1383
01:03:41.78 --> 01:03:45.70
the why you get the why at top gun.

1384
01:03:45.70 --> 01:03:50.98
We teach the why a lot but when you're writing the manual, when you're doing that and you

1385
01:03:50.98 --> 01:03:55.26
have all the testing equipment available and you're running a thousand computer generator

1386
01:03:55.26 --> 01:04:00.42
reps to see what the results are, the level of what you know about the why is just so much

1387
01:04:00.42 --> 01:04:01.42
more.

1388
01:04:01.42 --> 01:04:06.46
You just, there's a whole world available to you to and and the guys at top can too want

1389
01:04:06.46 --> 01:04:07.46
to be there.

1390
01:04:07.46 --> 01:04:10.46
The most that IPs are killing to get to a place like that.

1391
01:04:10.46 --> 01:04:12.66
So there's not a lot of slackers there.

1392
01:04:12.66 --> 01:04:16.10
Not a lot of dudes are trying to motivate or kind of prod along like, hey, buddy, let's

1393
01:04:16.10 --> 01:04:20.82
get go, you know, dudes are getting after it from startup to shut down every single day.

1394
01:04:20.82 --> 01:04:23.94
And so you're also getting pulled along because you want to keep up with your peers.

1395
01:04:23.94 --> 01:04:27.30
You know, you don't want to be the worst top gun instructor there.

1396
01:04:27.30 --> 01:04:30.46
You know, every time you think you've made it, you realize all you did is just getting

1397
01:04:30.46 --> 01:04:34.10
more selective pool and your goal is the same as to be the best that you can be and hopefully

1398
01:04:34.10 --> 01:04:35.94
the best you can be is one of the best guys there.

1399
01:04:35.94 --> 01:04:39.78
You know, you don't want to be last at top gun because then you're just last and when we

1400
01:04:39.78 --> 01:04:43.22
last and anything who does and so that's a real kind of a type of a real aggressive

1401
01:04:43.22 --> 01:04:48.46
group of dudes and they pull you and you you got to keep up and sometimes you know, a couple

1402
01:04:48.46 --> 01:04:52.70
guys here and they're done for for the most part the selection process works pretty well.

1403
01:04:52.70 --> 01:04:57.58
You know, what's cool just to bring this back for a second to, you know, talking about

1404
01:04:57.58 --> 01:04:59.50
leadership and interacting with other people.

1405
01:04:59.50 --> 01:05:06.34
The same exact thing happens when you start to pay attention to the tactics, techniques,

1406
01:05:06.34 --> 01:05:09.50
procedures of leadership.

1407
01:05:09.50 --> 01:05:12.02
You start to see the moves that people are making.

1408
01:05:12.02 --> 01:05:15.46
You know, you start to see the moves that your subordinate is making because his ego is

1409
01:05:15.46 --> 01:05:21.10
flaring up or because he's getting, taking too much ownership of something that he doesn't

1410
01:05:21.10 --> 01:05:22.74
want to let go and he's getting emotional about it.

1411
01:05:22.74 --> 01:05:29.18
You start seeing the same type of things at one third speed.

1412
01:05:29.18 --> 01:05:34.02
You know, that was great for me when I was running the West Coast Seal Team training.

1413
01:05:34.02 --> 01:05:35.66
That's all we take a platoon.

1414
01:05:35.66 --> 01:05:41.78
We had these scenarios and we put up a tune through, we put another platoon through, we put

1415
01:05:41.78 --> 01:05:44.30
another platoon through, we just over to the same scenario.

1416
01:05:44.30 --> 01:05:48.54
Guy here, shoot her over here, person on this hilltop, hostage in this room.

1417
01:05:48.54 --> 01:05:52.78
We put all these guys through the same scenario and so as soon as you approach, as soon

1418
01:05:52.78 --> 01:05:56.94
as you watch him approach and you say, oh, the platoon commander's too far in the rear.

1419
01:05:56.94 --> 01:05:59.94
So what's going to happen?

1420
01:05:59.94 --> 01:05:59.94
He's not going to see what's coming up front up.

1421
01:05:59.94 --> 01:06:00.94
Yep, there it is.

1422
01:06:00.94 --> 01:06:01.94
And so you just know what's going to happen.

1423
01:06:01.94 --> 01:06:03.26
And it's the same thing when you start dealing with their personalities.

1424
01:06:03.26 --> 01:06:06.54
You get a guy with a big ego that comes in and he wants to run everything his way and he thinks

1425
01:06:06.54 --> 01:06:08.62
he's going to be able to control everything and you're like, no, he's not going to be able

1426
01:06:08.62 --> 01:06:09.62
to do this.

1427
01:06:09.62 --> 01:06:13.50
So you can end up and I see that in the business world, obviously now too, where you get the

1428
01:06:13.50 --> 01:06:19.02
same exact problems of a guy that's too emotional about his plan or has too big of an ego

1429
01:06:19.02 --> 01:06:22.82
about something or he's not passing the word well enough for the, he's trying to control

1430
01:06:22.82 --> 01:06:24.50
everyone and not using decentralized commitment.

1431
01:06:24.50 --> 01:06:28.62
It's so obvious because you have the reps.

1432
01:06:28.62 --> 01:06:35.42
We have the reps now in this arena to be to look at a situation and say, okay, let me

1433
01:06:35.42 --> 01:06:36.42
watch this.

1434
01:06:36.42 --> 01:06:38.38
Oh, oh, okay, I see what's about to happen.

1435
01:06:38.38 --> 01:06:39.38
Here's what's going on.

1436
01:06:39.38 --> 01:06:40.38
We can break it down.

1437
01:06:40.38 --> 01:06:41.70
So it's the same thing across the board.

1438
01:06:41.70 --> 01:06:47.18
You get that level of just experience and repetitions and repetitions.

1439
01:06:47.18 --> 01:06:51.02
And now you can kind of see the future and you can predict what's going to happen.

1440
01:06:51.02 --> 01:06:54.18
And then the good thing is in the business world, when you can predict what's going to happen,

1441
01:06:54.18 --> 01:06:55.18
you can stop it.

1442
01:06:55.18 --> 01:06:58.18
You can get the people on the right track, pull them back in and get them arranged.

1443
01:06:58.18 --> 01:07:02.18
Well, I think the thing that a lot of people don't realize because sometimes they think

1444
01:07:02.18 --> 01:07:04.62
it's just different in the military.

1445
01:07:04.62 --> 01:07:09.02
The reasons why people are successful in the military and the reasons why people fail are

1446
01:07:09.02 --> 01:07:13.66
exactly the same as why you succeed in business and why you succeed as a person or why

1447
01:07:13.66 --> 01:07:14.66
you fail.

1448
01:07:14.66 --> 01:07:16.50
Now look, I know, you know, being an airplane is different.

1449
01:07:16.50 --> 01:07:17.50
I get that.

1450
01:07:17.50 --> 01:07:19.42
The environment might be a little bit different being combat certainly.

1451
01:07:19.42 --> 01:07:22.14
So the setting changes in all these things, the setting is different.

1452
01:07:22.14 --> 01:07:25.62
But the reasons are exactly the same.

1453
01:07:25.62 --> 01:07:28.82
And so to dispel whatever myth, you know, it's different in the military.

1454
01:07:28.82 --> 01:07:29.82
It's identical in the military.

1455
01:07:29.82 --> 01:07:30.82
No, no, no.

1456
01:07:30.82 --> 01:07:34.74
It comes out in an airplane or it comes out on a ship or whatever it comes out in downtown

1457
01:07:34.74 --> 01:07:35.74
Ramadhi.

1458
01:07:35.74 --> 01:07:36.74
The setting?

1459
01:07:36.74 --> 01:07:38.14
Yeah, it's different.

1460
01:07:38.14 --> 01:07:39.42
But what's going on?

1461
01:07:39.42 --> 01:07:41.46
It's identical.

1462
01:07:41.46 --> 01:07:45.94
And when you get to, when you get to being a place where you get to devote 100% of your time

1463
01:07:45.94 --> 01:07:51.18
to that and you're not distracted by just the distracts of military bureaucracy and life

1464
01:07:51.18 --> 01:07:56.54
of training schedules and did everybody do their annual survey.

1465
01:07:56.54 --> 01:08:00.58
When you're away from that and you're living in a world who's being tactical and doing nothing

1466
01:08:00.58 --> 01:08:04.78
but learning about how to be the best part you can be in the best teacher.

1467
01:08:04.78 --> 01:08:08.78
Everything, not just being a fighter about everything in the world slows down.

1468
01:08:08.78 --> 01:08:10.58
Everything slows down.

1469
01:08:10.58 --> 01:08:15.74
And I think it just gives you a perspective on life that, top God, I will carry those

1470
01:08:15.74 --> 01:08:16.74
lessons.

1471
01:08:16.74 --> 01:08:20.58
I mean, obviously, I care that with me and everything that I do and I will forever.

1472
01:08:20.58 --> 01:08:24.30
You know, what was honed at a place like that and in some ways in the military, it's just

1473
01:08:24.30 --> 01:08:27.66
a luxury because it's just not that common to have someone say for three years, you're

1474
01:08:27.66 --> 01:08:29.34
just going to do nothing but this.

1475
01:08:29.34 --> 01:08:30.34
What, dude?

1476
01:08:30.34 --> 01:08:31.34
Are you kidding me?

1477
01:08:31.34 --> 01:08:36.34
So, so speaking of decision making and good and or bad decision making.

1478
01:08:36.34 --> 01:08:41.50
So you're living the dream, you're up in Fallon, you actually have a house up in the mountains,

1479
01:08:41.50 --> 01:08:45.70
you're skiing, flying, everything's good.

1480
01:08:45.70 --> 01:08:49.98
And then somehow you make a decision that's a little bit off the track a little bit.

1481
01:08:49.98 --> 01:08:50.98
What was that all about?

1482
01:08:50.98 --> 01:08:51.98
I don't know.

1483
01:08:51.98 --> 01:08:53.50
I'm going to talk about it.

1484
01:08:53.50 --> 01:08:57.30
So yeah, I am, I'm in my third year at Top Gun, 2005.

1485
01:08:57.30 --> 01:08:58.90
I was selected be the training officer.

1486
01:08:58.90 --> 01:09:05.42
So I am running Top Gun as the senior IP there, which is just, it's awesome.

1487
01:09:05.42 --> 01:09:08.74
It's a, it is literally, as a Marine, it's a dream job.

1488
01:09:08.74 --> 01:09:10.94
You could not ask for anything better.

1489
01:09:10.94 --> 01:09:14.86
I was dating what ended becoming my wife.

1490
01:09:14.86 --> 01:09:17.22
So my wife Whitney at the time we're dating, so it lives out there.

1491
01:09:17.22 --> 01:09:22.98
We had a place in Tahoe, drove a Corvette, my life was pretty good, man.

1492
01:09:22.98 --> 01:09:26.26
And I'm actually coming up on my end of service obligation.

1493
01:09:26.26 --> 01:09:28.86
I can leave the Marine Corps in 2005.

1494
01:09:28.86 --> 01:09:33.74
And I sort of sold my relationship to Whitney on that idea.

1495
01:09:33.74 --> 01:09:37.18
Like, hey, come put up with this, live in a Tahoe, but I'm going to get out of the Marine

1496
01:09:37.18 --> 01:09:38.98
Corps and don't worry about this.

1497
01:09:38.98 --> 01:09:41.22
None of this is all, it's all come, don't worry about that.

1498
01:09:41.22 --> 01:09:42.22
Defondments war, it's over.

1499
01:09:42.22 --> 01:09:44.66
You don't need to worry about that.

1500
01:09:44.66 --> 01:09:50.30
So I think I oversold that to her a little bit, got her to move out to Tahoe.

1501
01:09:50.30 --> 01:09:57.90
And so there was just a part of me that didn't feel done with the Marine Corps.

1502
01:09:57.90 --> 01:10:03.24
And ironically, in this amazing experience that I had built up in my mind since I was 16 years

1503
01:10:03.24 --> 01:10:05.26
old, I'm now a Top Gun instructor.

1504
01:10:05.26 --> 01:10:10.02
I joined the Marine Corps knowing, as a fortunately, Top Gun was this big influence.

1505
01:10:10.02 --> 01:10:11.94
I'm going to leave the Marine Corps as a Top Gun instructor.

1506
01:10:11.94 --> 01:10:19.06
But I had spent four years flying F-18s off carriers, basically in the Navy for the

1507
01:10:19.06 --> 01:10:20.06
Frol and Tenset purposes.

1508
01:10:20.06 --> 01:10:22.78
And I was a Marine in the Marine Squadron, but we deployed with Navy carriers.

1509
01:10:22.78 --> 01:10:27.26
And I spent three years in Fallon on a Navy base with a Navy command.

1510
01:10:27.26 --> 01:10:32.10
It was one of three pilots on the Staff at Top Gun.

1511
01:10:32.10 --> 01:10:35.50
And there was just a part of me that I knew I was going to be done.

1512
01:10:35.50 --> 01:10:38.94
I was ready to leave the Marine Corps, but I wanted to leave the Marine Corps having

1513
01:10:38.94 --> 01:10:39.94
fulfilled.

1514
01:10:39.94 --> 01:10:44.78
That part of being a Marine, a real Marine, is kind of how I felt.

1515
01:10:44.78 --> 01:10:51.06
And so, again, I had kind of contemplated what I was going to do.

1516
01:10:51.06 --> 01:10:52.38
You talked to somebody called your monitor.

1517
01:10:52.38 --> 01:10:53.38
He's the guy that gives you orders.

1518
01:10:53.38 --> 01:10:54.98
Hey, this is what's next in your career.

1519
01:10:54.98 --> 01:10:58.18
This is where you're going to go for how long we think you should do this because it's

1520
01:10:58.18 --> 01:10:59.18
helpful for whatever.

1521
01:10:59.18 --> 01:11:03.70
The kind of explains it to you as a guy that basically is responsible for your career progression.

1522
01:11:03.70 --> 01:11:05.42
And I was kind of going back and forth with what do I do?

1523
01:11:05.42 --> 01:11:06.70
Do I stay into I get out?

1524
01:11:06.70 --> 01:11:10.06
And I kind of was struggling with that decision.

1525
01:11:10.06 --> 01:11:13.90
And he's like, look, we're going to, as a top instructor, you've got a lot of skill,

1526
01:11:13.90 --> 01:11:17.56
we've got a lot of experience, and then want you to use that and bring it back to the

1527
01:11:17.56 --> 01:11:20.22
Marine Corps and go to a squadron and teach these guys.

1528
01:11:20.22 --> 01:11:22.18
So, he gave me orders.

1529
01:11:22.18 --> 01:11:24.06
It says your order is going to be to go into Japan.

1530
01:11:24.06 --> 01:11:29.58
You're going to fly a f-a-tines back to the regular fleet squadron and you'll go from there.

1531
01:11:29.58 --> 01:11:32.46
And I even, I think I even got the point right out, orders given to me.

1532
01:11:32.46 --> 01:11:33.94
Would you be in like a squadron commander?

1533
01:11:33.94 --> 01:11:34.94
Or else?

1534
01:11:34.94 --> 01:11:35.94
No, I would have been.

1535
01:11:35.94 --> 01:11:36.94
The officer of Maine, it's officer.

1536
01:11:36.94 --> 01:11:37.94
I was too junior.

1537
01:11:37.94 --> 01:11:39.94
I'd only been in, I was like 10 years old.

1538
01:11:39.94 --> 01:11:40.94
You know, 11 years more.

1539
01:11:40.94 --> 01:11:43.90
So, I'm kind of what's called, we call it a department head, where I'm going to run a major

1540
01:11:43.90 --> 01:11:44.90
department in the squadron.

1541
01:11:44.90 --> 01:11:45.90
It was operations or Maine.

1542
01:11:45.90 --> 01:11:48.50
It took kind of the two big ones.

1543
01:11:48.50 --> 01:11:54.78
And I just didn't, it's not what I wanted to do.

1544
01:11:54.78 --> 01:11:56.90
I had, like I said, some long-term plans to do another stuff.

1545
01:11:56.90 --> 01:11:59.86
I was thinking, long-term I was going to get out and go do something else.

1546
01:11:59.86 --> 01:12:01.10
And so, I called them on her.

1547
01:12:01.10 --> 01:12:04.10
I said, hey, I want to do a factor.

1548
01:12:04.10 --> 01:12:08.10
A factor is that four-dark controllers, like you described earlier on the podcast.

1549
01:12:08.10 --> 01:12:11.14
And we had this little list on the internet that was called a hot fill list.

1550
01:12:11.14 --> 01:12:13.26
It was basically all the jobs that nobody wanted.

1551
01:12:13.26 --> 01:12:15.06
And if you called, it was a first come first serve.

1552
01:12:15.06 --> 01:12:16.34
You called and volunteer for anything.

1553
01:12:16.34 --> 01:12:18.70
You were automatically going to get it.

1554
01:12:18.70 --> 01:12:21.50
And because it was just a list of jobs that they couldn't, like, force on guys or whatever

1555
01:12:21.50 --> 01:12:22.98
reason I'm trying not to explain it all that well.

1556
01:12:22.98 --> 01:12:25.10
But the bottom line is the hot fill bill it is.

1557
01:12:25.10 --> 01:12:27.42
You call it yours for any reason.

1558
01:12:27.42 --> 01:12:31.74
And I'm like, hey, man, I see this a hot fill to be a four-dark controller in Japan.

1559
01:12:31.74 --> 01:12:35.30
Because I was going to go to Japan, we kind of cross that bridge of, okay, we're going to move overseas.

1560
01:12:35.30 --> 01:12:36.30
We didn't have any kids.

1561
01:12:36.30 --> 01:12:37.30
This is with Whitney.

1562
01:12:37.30 --> 01:12:38.30
This is with Whitney.

1563
01:12:38.30 --> 01:12:41.82
She's a little bit not super cool with it, but we found it will go to Japan.

1564
01:12:41.82 --> 01:12:42.82
We'll fly.

1565
01:12:42.82 --> 01:12:43.82
It'll be fine.

1566
01:12:43.82 --> 01:12:47.58
And he's like, you're not going to be a four-dark controller in Japan.

1567
01:12:47.58 --> 01:12:50.30
You're going to go fly and when I said dude, it's right there in black and white man.

1568
01:12:50.30 --> 01:12:51.30
It says hot fill.

1569
01:12:51.30 --> 01:12:53.30
I'm your guy.

1570
01:12:53.30 --> 01:12:56.62
And he was like, okay, yeah, I mean, he and so he gave me these orders.

1571
01:12:56.62 --> 01:13:00.06
And I wanted to be a factor.

1572
01:13:00.06 --> 01:13:04.50
Because I wanted to leave the Marine Corps having fulfilled all the parts about being a Marine.

1573
01:13:04.50 --> 01:13:07.82
And in my mind, it's funny because it's like we're opposite on that.

1574
01:13:07.82 --> 01:13:11.90
The real challenge or the thing I didn't really want to do, but I knew I should was getting

1575
01:13:11.90 --> 01:13:14.94
out of the airplane and doing something really hard in the ground.

1576
01:13:14.94 --> 01:13:19.06
Like, my natural state in the Marine Corps is in an airplane.

1577
01:13:19.06 --> 01:13:21.74
And for some people, they're miserable and I don't want to do it for me.

1578
01:13:21.74 --> 01:13:25.74
That was, so to do that was to be a four-dark controller was.

1579
01:13:25.74 --> 01:13:27.70
And it's strange to hear myself say it.

1580
01:13:27.70 --> 01:13:31.82
I didn't want to go be a four-dark controller, but I knew I needed to go do that.

1581
01:13:31.82 --> 01:13:36.22
There's no, I needed to leave the Marine Corps and say, yeah, I did that too.

1582
01:13:36.22 --> 01:13:40.38
And it was just a matter of a fulfillment of kind of an exclamation point on the career that

1583
01:13:40.38 --> 01:13:42.62
I always kind of fantasize him as I learned more about the Marine Corps.

1584
01:13:42.62 --> 01:13:44.38
There was more to it than just being a pilot.

1585
01:13:44.38 --> 01:13:45.38
Right.

1586
01:13:45.38 --> 01:13:49.30
So, so in your mind, were you thinking four-dark controller in Japan, met you're going to go

1587
01:13:49.30 --> 01:13:51.34
over there, you know, have a little team of Marines.

1588
01:13:51.34 --> 01:13:56.02
You'd go out to the different training ranges, call for some bombs, all good.

1589
01:13:56.02 --> 01:13:58.78
You know, go home at night, be with your wife.

1590
01:13:58.78 --> 01:13:59.78
Might even go.

1591
01:13:59.78 --> 01:14:00.78
Just in Japan.

1592
01:14:00.78 --> 01:14:04.62
Just in just nice little, sort of like a long vacation, working a little bit of time

1593
01:14:04.62 --> 01:14:05.62
on the ground.

1594
01:14:05.62 --> 01:14:06.62
I get to go to the field.

1595
01:14:06.62 --> 01:14:07.62
I spend the night in the woods.

1596
01:14:07.62 --> 01:14:08.62
Yeah, something like that.

1597
01:14:08.62 --> 01:14:09.62
You know, yeah.

1598
01:14:09.62 --> 01:14:10.62
It's really cool camping.

1599
01:14:10.62 --> 01:14:11.62
And they pay for it.

1600
01:14:11.62 --> 01:14:12.62
Yeah.

1601
01:14:12.62 --> 01:14:13.62
So, yeah, that's what it was.

1602
01:14:13.62 --> 01:14:14.62
I was going to go to Japan.

1603
01:14:14.62 --> 01:14:16.90
There's a bunch of really cool, it was going to be in Okinawa actually.

1604
01:14:16.90 --> 01:14:17.90
So, not mainland Japan.

1605
01:14:17.90 --> 01:14:19.30
Okinawa's got great scuba diving.

1606
01:14:19.30 --> 01:14:20.30
It's kind of neat.

1607
01:14:20.30 --> 01:14:22.10
And, you know, I could bring my wife with me.

1608
01:14:22.10 --> 01:14:24.14
It was going to be a lot of fun.

1609
01:14:24.14 --> 01:14:28.06
And I was going to teach guys how to use airplanes or drop bombs.

1610
01:14:28.06 --> 01:14:29.06
I knew how to do that.

1611
01:14:29.06 --> 01:14:31.18
I was going to be a really cool thing.

1612
01:14:31.18 --> 01:14:32.90
So, I get these orders.

1613
01:14:32.90 --> 01:14:35.74
And my wife and I moved out to Japan.

1614
01:14:35.74 --> 01:14:36.74
We got there.

1615
01:14:36.74 --> 01:14:40.74
And to Okinawa, I placed called Camp Pants in a little base up there in the middle of the island.

1616
01:14:40.74 --> 01:14:45.34
And I'm there probably.

1617
01:14:45.34 --> 01:14:47.02
Dude, I'm probably there a week.

1618
01:14:47.02 --> 01:14:52.22
And my boss, the brigade, the two commander, is like, hey, we're going to send a brigade

1619
01:14:52.22 --> 01:14:54.10
of platoon, which is probably 50 guys.

1620
01:14:54.10 --> 01:14:56.46
I'm guessing at the numbers.

1621
01:14:56.46 --> 01:14:57.86
To Camp Pants Jun.

1622
01:14:57.86 --> 01:15:01.38
Because that angle just came back from seven months in Iraq.

1623
01:15:01.38 --> 01:15:03.54
And they need to go right back and turn to very quick turn around.

1624
01:15:03.54 --> 01:15:06.54
They don't have enough qualified guys.

1625
01:15:06.54 --> 01:15:10.78
And so, I mean, I'm there a week and I'm coming home to tell Whitney like, hey, here's

1626
01:15:10.78 --> 01:15:12.50
the deal.

1627
01:15:12.50 --> 01:15:15.42
They need guys to go out to the Jun to do this deployment to Iraq.

1628
01:15:15.42 --> 01:15:17.34
And I'm going to be one of those guys.

1629
01:15:17.34 --> 01:15:20.54
So we were there instead of a year we were there for maybe.

1630
01:15:20.54 --> 01:15:23.54
She was like, is there snorkeling in Iraq?

1631
01:15:23.54 --> 01:15:27.42
Because you were telling me about scuba diving.

1632
01:15:27.42 --> 01:15:31.22
So we crammed a year's worth of stuff in about six weeks.

1633
01:15:31.22 --> 01:15:36.86
Because we had, so it was probably maybe early November when we kind of came down.

1634
01:15:36.86 --> 01:15:38.42
And we had to the end of the counter year.

1635
01:15:38.42 --> 01:15:43.30
So we shoved a year's worth of living in Japan in about six weeks.

1636
01:15:43.30 --> 01:15:47.86
And we did Korea, we did Thailand, we did mainland, Tokyo, we did got her dog call.

1637
01:15:47.86 --> 01:15:53.10
I mean, we did it all only December 22nd or whatever it was, you know, we flew home.

1638
01:15:53.10 --> 01:15:59.06
And I went straight to the Jun from there to start training with second Anglico, which was the

1639
01:15:59.06 --> 01:16:01.90
team that had just come back from Iraq after there's seven months appointment.

1640
01:16:01.90 --> 01:16:03.50
And I'm on a very quick turn.

1641
01:16:03.50 --> 01:16:04.90
They're probably four months into their turn on.

1642
01:16:04.90 --> 01:16:07.38
So you get just real quick for people that don't know what Anglico is.

1643
01:16:07.38 --> 01:16:09.18
Yeah, please.

1644
01:16:09.18 --> 01:16:14.94
The Anglico stands for Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company.

1645
01:16:14.94 --> 01:16:20.42
And really what it is, it's a group of small teams, four or five man teams called Fire

1646
01:16:20.42 --> 01:16:21.42
Power Control teams.

1647
01:16:21.42 --> 01:16:26.34
And what those teams were all supposed to be able to do is control airplanes, tell airplanes

1648
01:16:26.34 --> 01:16:28.70
what to do with their bombs.

1649
01:16:28.70 --> 01:16:31.70
We could control artillery, so how to fire artillery ordinance.

1650
01:16:31.70 --> 01:16:35.22
And even we didn't do it there on Iraq, but we could use Naval Gunfire.

1651
01:16:35.22 --> 01:16:38.14
So guns off ships, we were training all three of those skill sets.

1652
01:16:38.14 --> 01:16:43.70
And the whole point of an Anglico and a place like Iraq is you had different units, you

1653
01:16:43.70 --> 01:16:47.38
had Navy units, Army units, Marine Corps units, and as an Anglico, you're really a zone.

1654
01:16:47.38 --> 01:16:48.98
So that's what the L and Anglico is.

1655
01:16:48.98 --> 01:16:54.22
So I was trying to go to an Army unit and know how Army does people may not know this.

1656
01:16:54.22 --> 01:16:56.70
All the surface is actually do the same job differently.

1657
01:16:56.70 --> 01:16:59.82
So the Army and the Marine Corps will get the same mission and have a totally different way

1658
01:16:59.82 --> 01:17:01.82
of doing it because their doctrine they're training is different.

1659
01:17:01.82 --> 01:17:05.46
Now it's similar, but there's a bunch of pretty critical differences in there.

1660
01:17:05.46 --> 01:17:09.74
And so what we were training to do is we had all marine airplanes in where we were on Iraq

1661
01:17:09.74 --> 01:17:11.74
and all Army land forces.

1662
01:17:11.74 --> 01:17:14.46
So the Army doesn't have any training, how to use Marine Corps airplanes.

1663
01:17:14.46 --> 01:17:17.78
Marine Corps does have a lot of training to use Army ground forces.

1664
01:17:17.78 --> 01:17:21.18
So when those two people connect, there's a problem with how they communicate and what they

1665
01:17:21.18 --> 01:17:22.54
want from each other.

1666
01:17:22.54 --> 01:17:27.12
Insert Anglico, where the liaison between the Army ground units and in this case the Marine

1667
01:17:27.12 --> 01:17:28.62
Corps air units.

1668
01:17:28.62 --> 01:17:32.34
So my job was to control Marine airplanes to support the Army on the ground.

1669
01:17:32.34 --> 01:17:37.30
And that was all over Iraq and what the Anglico team would take this whole group and break

1670
01:17:37.30 --> 01:17:43.74
it into maybe 25 four-man teams and went all over the country to go do this same mission

1671
01:17:43.74 --> 01:17:45.34
with a whole bunch of different units.

1672
01:17:45.34 --> 01:17:47.86
So that was our mission as a four-dayer controller.

1673
01:17:47.86 --> 01:17:51.10
And I was qualified as a four-dayer controller because I had flown airplanes, job bombs

1674
01:17:51.10 --> 01:17:54.34
and combat understood how F-A teams were supposed to support ground maneuver and I went

1675
01:17:54.34 --> 01:17:56.26
to school with four-dayer controller school.

1676
01:17:56.26 --> 01:17:57.26
So let's go to Japan.

1677
01:17:57.26 --> 01:18:00.82
It'll be fun for pretend to do that for a year.

1678
01:18:00.82 --> 01:18:06.94
And then we had up in Camp Lajoon training to go to Iraq.

1679
01:18:06.94 --> 01:18:10.86
And now it's your first time doing grunt work.

1680
01:18:10.86 --> 01:18:17.18
So last time I had a held a rifle, shot a rifle, and worn a pair of combat boots was

1681
01:18:17.18 --> 01:18:19.02
the basic school.

1682
01:18:19.02 --> 01:18:23.98
So I had, you know, I got my air slotted at TBS.

1683
01:18:23.98 --> 01:18:25.58
That was a big day for me.

1684
01:18:25.58 --> 01:18:26.86
You know, I had done six months of that.

1685
01:18:26.86 --> 01:18:27.86
I had that check in the block.

1686
01:18:27.86 --> 01:18:29.14
I was feeling pretty good about that.

1687
01:18:29.14 --> 01:18:33.26
And I had never, I don't think I put on my camey, my camey-mathalized uniform.

1688
01:18:33.26 --> 01:18:35.58
I think I wore a flight suit.

1689
01:18:35.58 --> 01:18:38.06
Honestly, I think every day for seven years.

1690
01:18:38.06 --> 01:18:40.22
I could probably count on one hand.

1691
01:18:40.22 --> 01:18:41.94
Well, even longer than that, I was even counting flight school.

1692
01:18:41.94 --> 01:18:46.78
I could probably count on one hand the number of days that I didn't wear a flight

1693
01:18:46.78 --> 01:18:50.38
suit from the time that I selected to go to flight school to the time that I ended up in

1694
01:18:50.38 --> 01:18:51.38
Anglico.

1695
01:18:51.38 --> 01:18:52.38
Days.

1696
01:18:52.38 --> 01:18:54.86
I mean, so this was a foreign.

1697
01:18:54.86 --> 01:18:57.02
Now, I had, I was in Marine.

1698
01:18:57.02 --> 01:19:01.02
I went through the basic schools all back there somewhere.

1699
01:19:01.02 --> 01:19:06.30
But I think there is this, and I've mentioned this, I think, to you, I think it's just

1700
01:19:06.30 --> 01:19:08.26
sort of this habit of self-sabotage.

1701
01:19:08.26 --> 01:19:12.26
Like, well, I can't leave the Marine Corps that being a real Marine.

1702
01:19:12.26 --> 01:19:15.82
So I'm going to literally sabotage myself by volunteering for a job that I don't know if

1703
01:19:15.82 --> 01:19:18.46
I really want to do, but now I'm stuck doing it.

1704
01:19:18.46 --> 01:19:19.46
So I'm going to have to do that.

1705
01:19:19.46 --> 01:19:22.62
So I won't ever have to say, I didn't do that.

1706
01:19:22.62 --> 01:19:27.78
So this kind of cycle of breaking promises to my wife volunteering for stuff.

1707
01:19:27.78 --> 01:19:29.38
I didn't really want to do but knew that I should.

1708
01:19:29.38 --> 01:19:33.06
And next thing I know, it all blew up in my face because I was going to Japan.

1709
01:19:33.06 --> 01:19:34.78
That Japan's awesome.

1710
01:19:34.78 --> 01:19:38.26
Good sushi and great experience there and it's going to be awesome and I will be a

1711
01:19:38.26 --> 01:19:40.90
fact and I can, for the rest of my life, say, oh, I was a rumor.

1712
01:19:40.90 --> 01:19:43.94
I was a fact and I did all that.

1713
01:19:43.94 --> 01:19:45.58
And, you know, it's January and campus.

1714
01:19:45.58 --> 01:19:46.58
It's really what it is for.

1715
01:19:46.58 --> 01:19:47.58
Yeah, it's for.

1716
01:19:47.58 --> 01:19:48.78
Holy man.

1717
01:19:48.78 --> 01:19:50.58
So, yeah, make no mistake.

1718
01:19:50.58 --> 01:19:56.50
I mean, I did that, I volunteered, but I did not at the time when I was trading in my flying

1719
01:19:56.50 --> 01:19:57.98
orders for these fact orders.

1720
01:19:57.98 --> 01:20:01.30
I didn't expect to be in a body.

1721
01:20:01.30 --> 01:20:06.90
But as, hey, we need to send an uppercatable tune to campus unit prep those guys to

1722
01:20:06.90 --> 01:20:07.90
course.

1723
01:20:07.90 --> 01:20:08.90
Yep, I'm going.

1724
01:20:08.90 --> 01:20:09.90
I'm not going to not go.

1725
01:20:09.90 --> 01:20:10.90
That's what we need to do.

1726
01:20:10.90 --> 01:20:11.90
We're going to go do that.

1727
01:20:11.90 --> 01:20:15.54
When I got to campus unit, I ended up being the senior, just by rank, the senior

1728
01:20:15.54 --> 01:20:17.30
four-year control room in the unit.

1729
01:20:17.30 --> 01:20:21.14
I was kind of a middle-level major, I, you know, come from top going.

1730
01:20:21.14 --> 01:20:23.82
I came straight from top going to that and I was an experienced guy in the community

1731
01:20:23.82 --> 01:20:24.82
officer, no joke.

1732
01:20:24.82 --> 01:20:28.90
I picked her the day, walks in one day and he hands me a piece of paper and it's got like

1733
01:20:28.90 --> 01:20:31.78
26 lines on it, one for every team.

1734
01:20:31.78 --> 01:20:35.70
And on the other sheet was all the locations that we were going to go to.

1735
01:20:35.70 --> 01:20:38.46
And he's like fill out, we're all the teams are going because we got to cover these

1736
01:20:38.46 --> 01:20:42.34
15 different locations, you know, one to two teams per location and just write the number

1737
01:20:42.34 --> 01:20:44.54
of the team on there and get this back and move up close to business.

1738
01:20:44.54 --> 01:20:45.54
Like Roger, that's her.

1739
01:20:45.54 --> 01:20:47.38
I think her.

1740
01:20:47.38 --> 01:20:53.06
And again, my wife loves the story and I didn't tell her at the time, but my best friend

1741
01:20:53.06 --> 01:20:55.82
who I grew up with was in Ramadi at the time.

1742
01:20:55.82 --> 01:21:00.46
He was in third-time, seventh-marine, so we replaced when we got out there or did a turnover

1743
01:21:00.46 --> 01:21:02.06
with.

1744
01:21:02.06 --> 01:21:04.94
And that's where the war was, man.

1745
01:21:04.94 --> 01:21:09.54
I mean, in late 2005 and in early 2006, the war was in Ramadi.

1746
01:21:09.54 --> 01:21:14.66
And so I took the then, I wrote Lightning 6 and so 6162 and 6-3, we're all going

1747
01:21:14.66 --> 01:21:17.38
in Ramadi and I handed it off to every field of that, gave it to the CO.

1748
01:21:17.38 --> 01:21:24.02
So if you're going to go do something you don't necessarily want to do, but you're going

1749
01:21:24.02 --> 01:21:25.70
to go do it, you might as well do it.

1750
01:21:25.70 --> 01:21:27.74
And that's where the war was.

1751
01:21:27.74 --> 01:21:30.50
I could have gone to a whole host of other places where there's not much going on, it

1752
01:21:30.50 --> 01:21:32.30
would have been relatively chill.

1753
01:21:32.30 --> 01:21:34.18
I would have gotten that check in the block for sure.

1754
01:21:34.18 --> 01:21:39.10
I would have said, yeah, I went to a hero there and no hit on the guys in a different

1755
01:21:39.10 --> 01:21:42.34
place is just more going on there.

1756
01:21:42.34 --> 01:21:44.34
And if I wasn't going to go, then somebody else is going to go do that.

1757
01:21:44.34 --> 01:21:47.54
So it was Neil Neil was telling you what was up he said, hey, it's on.

1758
01:21:47.54 --> 01:21:48.54
Big time.

1759
01:21:48.54 --> 01:21:51.34
No, he and I were tight and we talked as regular as we could as much as we can say.

1760
01:21:51.34 --> 01:21:54.64
Oh, you're listening to you telling you like, oh, yeah, I was putting rounds on shooting

1761
01:21:54.64 --> 01:21:56.58
yesterday and you said, well, what were you shooting at?

1762
01:21:56.58 --> 01:21:58.22
And he's like, people.

1763
01:21:58.22 --> 01:22:02.14
Yeah, I was just, it was such a foreign thing to me as a pilot, certainly coming from

1764
01:22:02.14 --> 01:22:03.14
top.

1765
01:22:03.14 --> 01:22:04.14
And this is my best friend too.

1766
01:22:04.14 --> 01:22:06.14
And our whole life, we both wanted to be in Ramadi.

1767
01:22:06.14 --> 01:22:08.66
We never, we were in the same unit together.

1768
01:22:08.66 --> 01:22:10.66
We just couldn't get aligned with that.

1769
01:22:10.66 --> 01:22:13.74
It never occurred to me when we were kids dreaming about being in Ramadi or Firepotset.

1770
01:22:13.74 --> 01:22:17.50
The only time we'd ever served together was in Ramadi as Fort Controlers.

1771
01:22:17.50 --> 01:22:19.14
I healed with some of this podcast.

1772
01:22:19.14 --> 01:22:20.54
He'll get a good chuckle out of this.

1773
01:22:20.54 --> 01:22:22.78
But so he was there for the seven months prior.

1774
01:22:22.78 --> 01:22:27.68
So I think the, you know, maybe June or July of that year when I was getting ready to get

1775
01:22:27.68 --> 01:22:30.66
orders, he was on his factory.

1776
01:22:30.66 --> 01:22:32.50
And he was just a baton, a baton, a baton, three seven.

1777
01:22:32.50 --> 01:22:34.90
You know, OP293 OP, he would be here with you guys.

1778
01:22:34.90 --> 01:22:36.06
It's just doing the deed man.

1779
01:22:36.06 --> 01:22:41.70
I'm getting out of big time and struggling, this a lot going on there.

1780
01:22:41.70 --> 01:22:46.46
And when he would tell me this story is even someone who had been a Marine for that long,

1781
01:22:46.46 --> 01:22:47.66
he's like, yeah, we're in a firefight.

1782
01:22:47.66 --> 01:22:49.46
I'm like, are you shooting your rifle?

1783
01:22:49.46 --> 01:22:50.46
Is that yeah, man?

1784
01:22:50.46 --> 01:22:51.46
I get what?

1785
01:22:51.46 --> 01:22:55.30
The people that are shooting in me, it's just, it's, it's, it's, you're disconnected.

1786
01:22:55.30 --> 01:22:58.62
And you have this, you don't have this sense of what that means.

1787
01:22:58.62 --> 01:23:02.66
And so even as I was processing what he was saying and trying to understand and then

1788
01:23:02.66 --> 01:23:06.02
saying, I, this is where the, this is what I'm going to go do and kind of volunteering

1789
01:23:06.02 --> 01:23:07.02
to go do that.

1790
01:23:07.02 --> 01:23:08.02
I'll be honest with you.

1791
01:23:08.02 --> 01:23:12.42
I mean, there's still a part in retrospect that just didn't really quite fully grasp

1792
01:23:12.42 --> 01:23:13.26
what that meant.

1793
01:23:13.26 --> 01:23:17.82
I don't know how anybody on the first deployment to a place like a Romadi goes

1794
01:23:17.82 --> 01:23:18.82
into that.

1795
01:23:18.82 --> 01:23:21.06
You know, I dabble to aviation, like you said, I'm up in the sky.

1796
01:23:21.06 --> 01:23:23.26
I mean, it's relatively safe.

1797
01:23:23.26 --> 01:23:26.50
And I'm sure even the first deployment you did, there's just, there's an element of

1798
01:23:26.50 --> 01:23:28.70
just not being able to fully understand it.

1799
01:23:28.70 --> 01:23:32.30
And that didn't even become clear to me until right when we're getting ready to leave

1800
01:23:32.30 --> 01:23:35.66
from a body and the new units coming in and I was explaining what they're about to get

1801
01:23:35.66 --> 01:23:36.66
into.

1802
01:23:36.66 --> 01:23:39.62
They hit me and I just rewind myself a year earlier.

1803
01:23:39.62 --> 01:23:42.34
I'm like, I'm that dude that really doesn't know what the hell's about to happen to

1804
01:23:42.34 --> 01:23:44.86
him and what's about to go on.

1805
01:23:44.86 --> 01:23:50.02
But it was like I said, man, I don't even want to make it sound like that big of a deal.

1806
01:23:50.02 --> 01:23:52.74
But I've all in here for a fact to her.

1807
01:23:52.74 --> 01:23:54.78
They need to guys to go to the gym to go to Iraq.

1808
01:23:54.78 --> 01:23:56.06
That's where Romadi was where the fight was.

1809
01:23:56.06 --> 01:23:57.22
My best friend was there.

1810
01:23:57.22 --> 01:23:58.22
I'm going to Romadi.

1811
01:23:58.22 --> 01:23:59.22
Yeah.

1812
01:23:59.22 --> 01:24:00.22
And that was about it.

1813
01:24:00.22 --> 01:24:00.98
It was just, that's where I thought I should do.

1814
01:24:00.98 --> 01:24:03.02
So I went to Romadi.

1815
01:24:03.02 --> 01:24:04.86
And now you're leading Marines too.

1816
01:24:04.86 --> 01:24:05.86
Yeah.

1817
01:24:05.86 --> 01:24:14.06
And yes, so I explained just a minute ago about those things that may be successful and

1818
01:24:14.06 --> 01:24:16.66
things that lead to failure are identical.

1819
01:24:16.66 --> 01:24:19.86
They are the exact same things in an airplane or the same on the ground.

1820
01:24:19.86 --> 01:24:23.18
But the environment is different.

1821
01:24:23.18 --> 01:24:24.18
It is different.

1822
01:24:24.18 --> 01:24:26.06
There's no way around it.

1823
01:24:26.06 --> 01:24:30.94
And I also would say too that and for good reason, I think the ground Marines, you know,

1824
01:24:30.94 --> 01:24:33.10
I worked a lot of infantry in artillery.

1825
01:24:33.10 --> 01:24:36.50
Most of Anglican was made up of artillery and cemetery, not, and you know, obviously there's

1826
01:24:36.50 --> 01:24:38.78
pilots that are controllers.

1827
01:24:38.78 --> 01:24:43.94
There's a decent bit of skepticism of pilots coming in to lead these teams.

1828
01:24:43.94 --> 01:24:47.34
And I think for a good reason, you know, because a lot of these guys when I talk about

1829
01:24:47.34 --> 01:24:50.50
combat experience, they're on their third fourth floor in the Iraq.

1830
01:24:50.50 --> 01:24:51.50
Totally man.

1831
01:24:51.50 --> 01:24:52.50
You're coming in.

1832
01:24:52.50 --> 01:24:53.50
Yep.

1833
01:24:53.50 --> 01:24:54.34
They're on their, they've already done.

1834
01:24:54.34 --> 01:24:57.54
You're wearing your top gun patch on your shoulder of your can.

1835
01:24:57.54 --> 01:25:00.22
Well, what's worse is I'm not wearing my top gun patch.

1836
01:25:00.22 --> 01:25:01.22
I'm wearing my camis.

1837
01:25:01.22 --> 01:25:03.90
And they're like, have you ever washed those camis?

1838
01:25:03.90 --> 01:25:05.26
I'm like, as a matter of fact, I haven't.

1839
01:25:05.26 --> 01:25:08.10
They're fresh, you know, brand new.

1840
01:25:08.10 --> 01:25:11.86
And they're wearing their camis from, they did the march up to Baghdad.

1841
01:25:11.86 --> 01:25:15.06
They went home for four months and psycha right back around and did OIF2.

1842
01:25:15.06 --> 01:25:16.06
Guys, it did fullusion.

1843
01:25:16.06 --> 01:25:17.06
They're back.

1844
01:25:17.06 --> 01:25:18.98
And they're on the third deployment in three years.

1845
01:25:18.98 --> 01:25:20.70
And they're legit deployments.

1846
01:25:20.70 --> 01:25:24.14
And, you know, Dave Burke, Mr. Topkin, shows up, and was like, where's this brigade

1847
01:25:24.14 --> 01:25:25.14
platoon?

1848
01:25:25.14 --> 01:25:26.14
You know, where's my salt team?

1849
01:25:26.14 --> 01:25:31.18
You know, and I think that skepticism of, for good reason, is who is the

1850
01:25:31.18 --> 01:25:32.18
best guy?

1851
01:25:32.18 --> 01:25:36.70
And that's a real, that was a real leadership challenge for me, is to apply those things

1852
01:25:36.70 --> 01:25:41.34
that I knew were effective, but in an environment that I'm totally out of my comfort zone,

1853
01:25:41.34 --> 01:25:42.34
man.

1854
01:25:42.34 --> 01:25:43.34
I'm totally out of my comfort zone.

1855
01:25:43.34 --> 01:25:48.54
And I have to apply a skill set of things that I just haven't, I haven't shot a rifle

1856
01:25:48.54 --> 01:25:50.18
since 1994.

1857
01:25:50.18 --> 01:25:53.22
I got to the basic school in October, 1994, the first thing you do is go to the rifle

1858
01:25:53.22 --> 01:25:54.22
range.

1859
01:25:54.22 --> 01:25:58.18
That's the last time my school is a trigger on a rifle was October of 1994.

1860
01:25:58.18 --> 01:26:02.62
The here it is is, you know, January of 2006, prepping to go to Ramadi, and I got to

1861
01:26:02.62 --> 01:26:04.78
sit in my M4.

1862
01:26:04.78 --> 01:26:07.58
So they should be skeptical a little bit.

1863
01:26:07.58 --> 01:26:12.18
And it was a challenge for me, a real leadership challenge of to be successful in a place

1864
01:26:12.18 --> 01:26:13.18
that I'm not comfortable with.

1865
01:26:13.18 --> 01:26:18.78
To be honest with you, if you told me I was going to lead a squadron in combat, I'd feel

1866
01:26:18.78 --> 01:26:20.50
pretty comfortable doing that.

1867
01:26:20.50 --> 01:26:24.10
I know it would be a challenge, it'd be hard, but I wouldn't feel like, I don't know

1868
01:26:24.10 --> 01:26:25.74
about this, I would be all over it.

1869
01:26:25.74 --> 01:26:30.10
I don't mean to say easy, but right in my wheelhouse, not true for that.

1870
01:26:30.10 --> 01:26:35.30
So I worked hard to try to be successful in that, and you know, you got to get your Marines

1871
01:26:35.30 --> 01:26:39.86
to buy off on your program, you know, because you're going to go down town with those

1872
01:26:39.86 --> 01:26:43.94
guys, you know, and every relationship with anyone with those guys was different as you

1873
01:26:43.94 --> 01:26:47.66
know, you know, and you got to build those relationships and demonstrate that, you know,

1874
01:26:47.66 --> 01:26:49.26
this is going to work.

1875
01:26:49.26 --> 01:26:53.30
And then, you know, just talk a little bit about, you know, people have heard about what

1876
01:26:53.30 --> 01:26:59.02
you bruiser was doing over in Ramadi, and we'll get to how we interacted, but overall,

1877
01:26:59.02 --> 01:27:04.30
all you guys doing, when you first got there, you just kind of jumped into it, we could

1878
01:27:04.30 --> 01:27:06.78
feed as they say.

1879
01:27:06.78 --> 01:27:08.78
We did, man.

1880
01:27:08.78 --> 01:27:10.42
So I get there.

1881
01:27:10.42 --> 01:27:13.82
I've got a salt team that stands for supporting arms liaison team.

1882
01:27:13.82 --> 01:27:17.94
Really what it meant was three of those little four man teams, grouped together in a

1883
01:27:17.94 --> 01:27:23.46
one 13-man team, because we had an additional corpsman, little medic with us.

1884
01:27:23.46 --> 01:27:29.22
So I had three of those teams that I was responsible for, and I kind of knew what I expected

1885
01:27:29.22 --> 01:27:30.22
was going to happen.

1886
01:27:30.22 --> 01:27:33.62
I got there that I would be in what's called the talk, the tactical operations center,

1887
01:27:33.62 --> 01:27:39.50
which was I kind of run things from the desk and farm out my teams and units to support

1888
01:27:39.50 --> 01:27:40.66
the guys that needed our help.

1889
01:27:40.66 --> 01:27:42.26
These army units are going to go to missions.

1890
01:27:42.26 --> 01:27:44.54
They needed someone to help them control the air.

1891
01:27:44.54 --> 01:27:45.54
I had those teams.

1892
01:27:45.54 --> 01:27:46.94
I would give them those teams.

1893
01:27:46.94 --> 01:27:53.78
Well, it took basically no time to get there and realize that the demand signal for our support

1894
01:27:53.78 --> 01:27:56.46
was higher than we could have ever responded to.

1895
01:27:56.46 --> 01:28:00.62
They needed 20 of our teams, not three.

1896
01:28:00.62 --> 01:28:06.34
And so that idea that I would kind of be a COC guy, a talk guy, was over in the first day,

1897
01:28:06.34 --> 01:28:09.14
because as I get there and we're going to turn over the other angle of team getting

1898
01:28:09.14 --> 01:28:13.38
ready to leave, he's introducing me to all the people he's been working with.

1899
01:28:13.38 --> 01:28:17.26
It's like 15 different teams.

1900
01:28:17.26 --> 01:28:20.58
They're not running operations like three battalions.

1901
01:28:20.58 --> 01:28:23.58
It's 40 squads.

1902
01:28:23.58 --> 01:28:27.94
These guys are going out in 12, 13, and they all need you.

1903
01:28:27.94 --> 01:28:28.94
And there's operations.

1904
01:28:28.94 --> 01:28:33.58
I mean, just so everyone is there's 5,600 people in the 1, 180 or you showed up in the

1905
01:28:33.58 --> 01:28:36.42
2, 2, 2, 2, 6,000 people or whatever.

1906
01:28:36.42 --> 01:28:40.38
And there's operations going on all over Ramadi, every single night, there's people patrol

1907
01:28:40.38 --> 01:28:43.14
and there's people getting in fire fights, every single night, there's constant gun

1908
01:28:43.14 --> 01:28:44.14
fire.

1909
01:28:44.14 --> 01:28:47.10
And so there's no way with three teams you're going to cover all that.

1910
01:28:47.10 --> 01:28:48.10
You can't do it.

1911
01:28:48.10 --> 01:28:49.10
Yeah.

1912
01:28:49.10 --> 01:28:54.82
And that was sort of the immediate awareness for me is not only was I not going to be able

1913
01:28:54.82 --> 01:28:56.94
to support everything.

1914
01:28:56.94 --> 01:29:00.78
I know how to prioritize and tell folks, hey, we can do this and not that.

1915
01:29:00.78 --> 01:29:02.74
I can help you here or there.

1916
01:29:02.74 --> 01:29:06.82
And so very quickly, it was a matter of how am I going to break down my team and support

1917
01:29:06.82 --> 01:29:09.02
these guys.

1918
01:29:09.02 --> 01:29:15.02
I did have an advantage that I was as an F-18 pilot, that was the primary aircraft, F-18's

1919
01:29:15.02 --> 01:29:17.18
and herers of the primary aircraft that was doing the support.

1920
01:29:17.18 --> 01:29:19.94
And I knew those airplanes really well.

1921
01:29:19.94 --> 01:29:23.82
And I was able to very quickly when I saw what the army, hey, we're doing this patrol

1922
01:29:23.82 --> 01:29:24.82
today.

1923
01:29:24.82 --> 01:29:28.30
And we're going to take our humbys from the camp Ramadi to go to this location.

1924
01:29:28.30 --> 01:29:31.38
And it would be really difficult just to get there, just navigating at night in your

1925
01:29:31.38 --> 01:29:35.34
humbys on the night vision goggles and the roads can be kind of confusing and you know what

1926
01:29:35.34 --> 01:29:39.02
it's like down there and some days you're operating in downtown Ramadi and it's straight

1927
01:29:39.02 --> 01:29:42.58
up urban combat like just buildings.

1928
01:29:42.58 --> 01:29:47.22
And five miles away you can be in a place we called it my Charlie one that it looks

1929
01:29:47.22 --> 01:29:48.22
like a Vietnam.

1930
01:29:48.22 --> 01:29:53.58
I mean it's the contrast if we're being so close together was so incredible how different

1931
01:29:53.58 --> 01:29:54.58
those places were.

1932
01:29:54.58 --> 01:29:56.30
And so every environment was different.

1933
01:29:56.30 --> 01:30:00.54
I was able to understand how what airplanes could do well and not well in those environments.

1934
01:30:00.54 --> 01:30:05.02
And so as they ask for support on my head, I can't really do that but what I can do is this.

1935
01:30:05.02 --> 01:30:06.94
And maybe this would be more helpful for you.

1936
01:30:06.94 --> 01:30:10.62
And I could very quickly build a relationship with the army which is really who you needed

1937
01:30:10.62 --> 01:30:13.02
to be the best support for the Marines.

1938
01:30:13.02 --> 01:30:14.02
They were going to get on board.

1939
01:30:14.02 --> 01:30:15.02
We were good.

1940
01:30:15.02 --> 01:30:16.02
We had a relationship.

1941
01:30:16.02 --> 01:30:19.82
I wasn't worried about my Marines and us building our team.

1942
01:30:19.82 --> 01:30:25.34
What I was worried about was us as a team being effective for the folks we were supporting.

1943
01:30:25.34 --> 01:30:27.70
And showing that we could do good work for those guys.

1944
01:30:27.70 --> 01:30:29.70
And we took a very different approach.

1945
01:30:29.70 --> 01:30:33.34
I immediately broke our team into three separate teams, 6162 and 630.

1946
01:30:33.34 --> 01:30:38.74
I actually sent the 613 team, a guy named Alan to another base, Blue Diamond.

1947
01:30:38.74 --> 01:30:41.82
And you remember that base right across the river because there was a company base out of

1948
01:30:41.82 --> 01:30:45.06
Blue Diamond that we're doing operations independently and they never had any angle

1949
01:30:45.06 --> 01:30:46.06
to support.

1950
01:30:46.06 --> 01:30:50.26
So I do, you got to go move, they literally moved there and lived with those guys and then

1951
01:30:50.26 --> 01:30:53.06
my other team 6162 Adam.

1952
01:30:53.06 --> 01:30:59.02
And I just, we took a whiteboard and all the requests for support.

1953
01:30:59.02 --> 01:31:00.58
We just started plugging in our names in.

1954
01:31:00.58 --> 01:31:04.66
And so it was just, I had five guys, he had 48 is on Humby at my own Humby.

1955
01:31:04.66 --> 01:31:09.78
We had all the weapons, all the radios and just started to just go do operations.

1956
01:31:09.78 --> 01:31:12.26
Two to eight would do everything for just a little vehicle patrol where they would just

1957
01:31:12.26 --> 01:31:13.26
do a presence patrol.

1958
01:31:13.26 --> 01:31:14.70
They're two Humby is driving around the city.

1959
01:31:14.70 --> 01:31:17.78
We would just jump in on that and just bring a third truck, which was a ton of firepower

1960
01:31:17.78 --> 01:31:19.10
and awareness.

1961
01:31:19.10 --> 01:31:22.62
Sometimes we were just doing foot patrols and we would just go walk around and do moving

1962
01:31:22.62 --> 01:31:26.10
to contact or do room clearing stuff like that.

1963
01:31:26.10 --> 01:31:31.90
I found myself way, way out of my comfort zone very early.

1964
01:31:31.90 --> 01:31:39.70
I think my second mission there was a raid where I was ended up clearing a room.

1965
01:31:39.70 --> 01:31:43.78
I was in a stack of dudes clearing a room.

1966
01:31:43.78 --> 01:31:49.50
Well I was trying to talk to airplanes overhead and it was just basically a manpower

1967
01:31:49.50 --> 01:31:50.50
shortage.

1968
01:31:50.50 --> 01:31:56.02
Yeah, we'd get in, you need to, you need to go, guys go clear the room and rush that.

1969
01:31:56.02 --> 01:31:58.34
Now, in I was a senior mid-grade major.

1970
01:31:58.34 --> 01:32:00.78
I was always kind of one of the senior guys, but I wasn't in charge of this.

1971
01:32:00.78 --> 01:32:03.38
So I would be working for a first lieutenant, which was perfectly fine.

1972
01:32:03.38 --> 01:32:04.38
It was his platoon.

1973
01:32:04.38 --> 01:32:05.38
He was doing this mission.

1974
01:32:05.38 --> 01:32:06.38
He knew what he was doing.

1975
01:32:06.38 --> 01:32:08.26
I was there to support his best as I could.

1976
01:32:08.26 --> 01:32:10.54
That image of like, y'all just get up on the roof and control there.

1977
01:32:10.54 --> 01:32:11.54
It'll be awesome.

1978
01:32:11.54 --> 01:32:13.30
You need me to blow up negative.

1979
01:32:13.30 --> 01:32:17.30
I mean, it was, hey, get in line and start getting out here.

1980
01:32:17.30 --> 01:32:20.18
Now, I think that I remember that second mission.

1981
01:32:20.18 --> 01:32:23.86
We're with the two to eight and the lieutenant was, I think he was like, I think he worked

1982
01:32:23.86 --> 01:32:24.86
at Home Depot.

1983
01:32:24.86 --> 01:32:25.86
No joke.

1984
01:32:25.86 --> 01:32:26.86
I mean, National Guard units.

1985
01:32:26.86 --> 01:32:28.46
Yeah, National Guard units, these dudes were awesome.

1986
01:32:28.46 --> 01:32:31.58
They'd been there for probably 10 or 11 months by the time I got there.

1987
01:32:31.58 --> 01:32:32.58
They're maybe even longer.

1988
01:32:32.58 --> 01:32:33.78
They've been there almost a year.

1989
01:32:33.78 --> 01:32:39.06
Hardened dudes that had lost a lot of guys and sacrificed a ton, but I was learning everything

1990
01:32:39.06 --> 01:32:41.74
I could from them because they were veterans and I was brand new.

1991
01:32:41.74 --> 01:32:45.14
I was supposed to bring the great capability, but the reality was I was just soaking up from

1992
01:32:45.14 --> 01:32:47.66
them as much as I could.

1993
01:32:47.66 --> 01:32:51.42
And I'm, I'm clear in a room with this guy, you know.

1994
01:32:51.42 --> 01:32:55.54
So, the phrase, what am I doing here?

1995
01:32:55.54 --> 01:32:59.58
Went through my head a lot while I was there.

1996
01:32:59.58 --> 01:33:03.14
And it was just kind of, remind you, was it type of place that the deal was is when you got

1997
01:33:03.14 --> 01:33:08.06
there, it was just a bullet train and you just jumped on the train.

1998
01:33:08.06 --> 01:33:09.06
You had to.

1999
01:33:09.06 --> 01:33:10.06
You couldn't slow things down.

2000
01:33:10.06 --> 01:33:13.54
You certainly couldn't ask those other guys, hey, can we dial it back a little bit

2001
01:33:13.54 --> 01:33:15.34
we need to get up to speed?

2002
01:33:15.34 --> 01:33:18.74
They were just doing their thing and if you were going to be anything other than a hindrance

2003
01:33:18.74 --> 01:33:21.26
you need to get on board immediately.

2004
01:33:21.26 --> 01:33:24.50
And so that's what we did as best we could.

2005
01:33:24.50 --> 01:33:29.34
And I have a lot to thank for those guys at T2A because no matter how hard we tried those

2006
01:33:29.34 --> 01:33:31.54
first couple of times we're just getting up to speed.

2007
01:33:31.54 --> 01:33:35.70
We're not, you know, bringing our A game, we're trying to figure out what's going on around

2008
01:33:35.70 --> 01:33:39.50
us and there's no doubt that without those guys, their leadership, their willingness

2009
01:33:39.50 --> 01:33:42.10
to kind of bring us on board and get us up to speed.

2010
01:33:42.10 --> 01:33:43.58
That played a big part.

2011
01:33:43.58 --> 01:33:46.14
We got up to speed quickly, but they won.

2012
01:33:46.14 --> 01:33:47.74
I'm sure, you know, we were struggling to tell us.

2013
01:33:47.74 --> 01:33:51.78
It's just like we were talking about with flying and jiu-jitsu and fighting and everything

2014
01:33:51.78 --> 01:33:52.78
else.

2015
01:33:52.78 --> 01:33:54.18
You show up there and things are going.

2016
01:33:54.18 --> 01:33:55.74
They're not slowed down a third.

2017
01:33:55.74 --> 01:33:59.38
They're going five times faster and you're just seeing, you know, you're getting told

2018
01:33:59.38 --> 01:34:00.38
to clear a room.

2019
01:34:00.38 --> 01:34:03.54
That's the only thing in the world you can see is now this room and you're not aware of

2020
01:34:03.54 --> 01:34:07.90
all this other stuff that's going on and it definitely takes some ops to get your, get

2021
01:34:07.90 --> 01:34:09.54
your senses about you of what's happening.

2022
01:34:09.54 --> 01:34:10.54
Yeah.

2023
01:34:10.54 --> 01:34:13.38
And the ops were, there were so many different kinds of operations like I said, you

2024
01:34:13.38 --> 01:34:18.66
need to go from doing just, you know, a three humvy presence patrol and downtown

2025
01:34:18.66 --> 01:34:24.26
or body is not cool. It's not. It's just you're just waiting for something to go wrong,

2026
01:34:24.26 --> 01:34:27.90
you know, whether it's getting lit up, you know, in a firefight, RPG's getting shot. I mean,

2027
01:34:27.90 --> 01:34:31.38
you were literally just driving around waiting for somebody to do something to you, you

2028
01:34:31.38 --> 01:34:32.94
know, these presence patrols.

2029
01:34:32.94 --> 01:34:37.06
And then you go right from that to you get some intelligence that somebody needed to

2030
01:34:37.06 --> 01:34:40.78
grab was in, you know, a house somewhere in a totally different environment and you'd be

2031
01:34:40.78 --> 01:34:42.18
off doing a raid.

2032
01:34:42.18 --> 01:34:44.78
We help stand up the QRF. You talked about that in the past.

2033
01:34:44.78 --> 01:34:48.54
The quick reaction force where you literally just waited right outside the gate

2034
01:34:48.54 --> 01:34:53.74
to the main base for somebody to call for help. Okay, something's gone wrong. It's here,

2035
01:34:53.74 --> 01:35:00.94
come help us. And so we just started doing all these missions. And I, I just was on board

2036
01:35:00.94 --> 01:35:04.50
with all of them. And they vary. They were very different from day to day. And you got

2037
01:35:04.50 --> 01:35:06.58
to call for fire, too. Do you legit?

2038
01:35:06.58 --> 01:35:13.94
We did. We, we between me, I did a lot and my teams, we, I controlled the release of every

2039
01:35:13.94 --> 01:35:19.94
single piece of ordinance in the Marine Corps imagery, Marine Corps inventory. So every piece

2040
01:35:19.94 --> 01:35:23.98
of ordinance that the, the air, the hornets and the carriers dropped and everything from

2041
01:35:23.98 --> 01:35:28.76
the huge in the cobras and our, we called our teller as well. They had a, you know,

2042
01:35:28.76 --> 01:35:33.08
a, a field of artillery battalion out there that we did controls from as I think, if I did

2043
01:35:33.08 --> 01:35:38.78
myself. So, you know, that store, you know, you get to TBS. There's an old saying in the

2044
01:35:38.78 --> 01:35:42.94
Marine Corps, we all subscribed to it. Every Marine's a rifleman. And we are a top

2045
01:35:42.94 --> 01:35:47.74
unit instructor that could not be further from the truth. Because the last thing you are

2046
01:35:47.74 --> 01:35:52.06
as a top gun, as the training officer at Top Gun, skiing in Lake Tahoe on the Saturday afternoon

2047
01:35:52.06 --> 01:35:57.10
is a rifleman. But I will, I will say this for the Marine Corps. Yeah, I'm biased. I'm a little

2048
01:35:57.10 --> 01:36:03.26
proctor of the Marine Corps. Dude, it's all in there. The OCS, TBS, all that exposure, all

2049
01:36:03.26 --> 01:36:06.70
that doctrine, everything that you learn, it's there. Now it took a while to dig down and

2050
01:36:06.70 --> 01:36:10.78
find it. And those same things that when I went to OCS and I was a skiniest guy there and

2051
01:36:10.78 --> 01:36:14.14
I was scared I couldn't get through it on my way to second. Bigger tougher, stronger

2052
01:36:14.14 --> 01:36:19.34
dudes are doing this or not doing this and I am. It's all in there. And so I just had to

2053
01:36:19.34 --> 01:36:27.42
figure out a tap that stuff again and bring it back up and just go do it. So, great decision.

2054
01:36:27.42 --> 01:36:32.94
Nira, I am in Ramadi, get an after it. And then you guys showed up. Yeah, there was one story

2055
01:36:32.94 --> 01:36:39.02
you were telling me that you were calling for fire up in MC1 and it was your buddy. Yeah.

2056
01:36:39.02 --> 01:36:45.74
Yeah, we are doing what's called movement to contact my favorite mission as a pilot. Nothing

2057
01:36:45.74 --> 01:36:49.26
better than movement to contact. And the movement to contact mission is you literally drive your

2058
01:36:49.26 --> 01:36:53.34
humbys, take all your your folks out and you set up a staging area in the north side of this

2059
01:36:54.70 --> 01:36:59.82
this big area is big, kind of wooded dirt has like little ravines and trees and stuff like that.

2060
01:36:59.82 --> 01:37:05.34
And we would just we would walk up a troll. And you know, if 10 15 guys would just go from north

2061
01:37:05.34 --> 01:37:09.98
to south and the mission was called movement to contact. So you walked until you got in contact.

2062
01:37:09.98 --> 01:37:14.78
Which went you got into a firefight. And I remember not the same day but my first day going there.

2063
01:37:14.78 --> 01:37:18.22
I think it was a Bravo Company at 2 to 8. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure it was and I met

2064
01:37:18.22 --> 01:37:22.94
the platoon commander for the first time. And I kind of get out of my humbys. I walk up and I'm looking

2065
01:37:22.94 --> 01:37:25.98
for the platoon commander. I'm there as a supporting asset. I'm a helpful guy because I bring

2066
01:37:25.98 --> 01:37:30.86
airplanes. It's going to be good for them. And he walks up and he's got a shotgun hanging on his

2067
01:37:30.86 --> 01:37:36.94
kid. And you know I was a brand new guy but I was I'm like hey what's with the shotgun?

2068
01:37:36.94 --> 01:37:41.42
You know I have a rifle. He was like hey the bounce with the I found that this is the best weapon

2069
01:37:41.42 --> 01:37:46.14
for these type of missions. And it turns out he actually was right on that patrol. It's like

2070
01:37:47.26 --> 01:37:50.54
dude what am I doing here man? You know I'm going to do a foot patrol with a guy with shotgun.

2071
01:37:52.14 --> 01:37:58.38
So I knew that I was in there's a lot in store for that. And we would do these patrols

2072
01:37:58.38 --> 01:38:02.86
these these movement contacts and you'd end up in a building. And my job as a fact was hey get out

2073
01:38:02.86 --> 01:38:07.34
in the building get up on top of the roof right away and I would do Overwatch. You know similar

2074
01:38:07.34 --> 01:38:11.42
different assets I had airplanes I had radios seals would do Overwatch all the time and there's

2075
01:38:11.42 --> 01:38:14.70
just a matter of cover and moves. I would get up in the roof and I'd go hey this is what I see.

2076
01:38:14.70 --> 01:38:18.78
This is what the airplane sees. Okay you guys jump to that next building. Sometimes the next building

2077
01:38:18.78 --> 01:38:23.18
would be 20 yards away sometimes it would be 200 yards away. So you would you would just do these

2078
01:38:23.18 --> 01:38:27.58
bounding movements building to building and then when they get to the next building my other guy would

2079
01:38:27.58 --> 01:38:30.46
be up in the roof. It's a good way to run down and go to the next building.

2080
01:38:34.22 --> 01:38:40.22
And so we get into this building and as soon as they get up on top of the roof of the building

2081
01:38:40.22 --> 01:38:44.22
so if you can picture it half of us are in the roof of the building half of the other guys are

2082
01:38:44.22 --> 01:38:48.30
trying to move to the other building so they're out in the open. And from that other building as I

2083
01:38:48.30 --> 01:38:53.34
get up in the roof that I look up in the first one happens is like three RPGs hit the building

2084
01:38:53.34 --> 01:38:59.02
that I'm in directly underneath me. Probably my team by like 15 feet below us so above their heads

2085
01:38:59.02 --> 01:39:04.78
and below us that's the first thing that happens and there was a vehicle like a truck and I was a

2086
01:39:04.78 --> 01:39:10.06
car was like just some car in between on a look kind of a dirt road behind some trees where this

2087
01:39:10.06 --> 01:39:16.14
fire came from and we had airplanes overhead. There was two F-18 D's I remember from an East Coast

2088
01:39:16.14 --> 01:39:21.90
squadron and you know a TBS they teach you hey everyone Marines arrive on man and they say

2089
01:39:21.90 --> 01:39:27.34
they tell you these stories is that one day you're going to be in a position where you're going to

2090
01:39:27.34 --> 01:39:30.78
be in a firefight and there's going to be an airplane overhead and it's going to be a buddy

2091
01:39:30.78 --> 01:39:34.54
of yours from TBS going to be your old buddy and you're going to be like hey Jaco it's day to

2092
01:39:34.54 --> 01:39:38.38
help me out and Dave's going to roll in on his white horse and come over this hornet and blast

2093
01:39:38.38 --> 01:39:43.26
these things out and your infantry buddy is going to thank you one day. I'm going to write on.

2094
01:39:43.26 --> 01:39:49.10
The only problem was that I was on the ground and the guy I find the airplane was one of my closest

2095
01:39:49.10 --> 01:39:56.22
friends again and Boo Frieden was an opso of the squash and I just left and no joke I'm like

2096
01:39:57.58 --> 01:40:01.90
hey we're in a troops in contact you know we're taking fire from wherever and on the radio

2097
01:40:02.94 --> 01:40:07.74
he says hey chip it's Boo what do you need and it took me to wrap back to TBS on the problem was I was supposed

2098
01:40:07.74 --> 01:40:15.90
to be in an airplane when that happened and I'm like I said I said South to North call wings level

2099
01:40:15.90 --> 01:40:21.18
and that's what happened and I got four passes from these FATs did these strafing runs on this car

2100
01:40:21.18 --> 01:40:26.14
and I remember looking at the army guys with his first lieutenant and I looked at him I go

2101
01:40:26.14 --> 01:40:31.66
you're going to be fine like super cool like very chill hey this just happened I see what's going on

2102
01:40:31.66 --> 01:40:36.70
there's hornets over head out I saw everything what do you need I need this we're in and you

2103
01:40:36.70 --> 01:40:41.58
the X call is wings level hey you're cleared hot and you know the hair and arms stand up

2104
01:40:41.58 --> 01:40:47.34
telling us sorry just one of those stories where the Marine Corps for whatever insane reason

2105
01:40:47.34 --> 01:40:51.90
will take FATs and train them millions of dollars and ten years of training them and they'll stick

2106
01:40:51.90 --> 01:40:58.46
them on the ground and it's for that exact reason that that exact event was I could bring an asset

2107
01:40:58.46 --> 01:41:03.98
that the army would never have an environment that they would never be able to use and through

2108
01:41:03.98 --> 01:41:10.70
two buddies just talking pointing was to each other on the radio make it happen in like that and

2109
01:41:12.70 --> 01:41:16.46
I was supposed to be in that airplane jacco that's how it was supposed to work out but in that

2110
01:41:16.46 --> 01:41:20.62
particular day of man it was the roles of reverse but it was it was an awesome it was kind of a

2111
01:41:20.62 --> 01:41:24.38
culmination of a lot of things like that the Marine Corps it's a legit that thing they'd read

2112
01:41:24.38 --> 01:41:29.18
nuts it's a real thing and it was pretty satisfying to be awesome you see that carburetor in the ground

2113
01:41:29.18 --> 01:41:36.30
and then eventually yeah I don't know maybe a month or so goes by and we show up and who's the

2114
01:41:36.30 --> 01:41:44.30
first who do you meet first life yep life was the first guy that I met actually life in Tony

2115
01:41:44.30 --> 01:41:51.18
all right show up together um so we had seen you guys you know we had turned over and we were just

2116
01:41:51.18 --> 01:41:55.02
kind of getting up to speed we probably been there maybe a month or so before you guys had so you

2117
01:41:55.02 --> 01:41:59.34
know quick learning curve we're just kind of getting comfortable with what's going on we also

2118
01:41:59.34 --> 01:42:05.58
know there's a new brigade of platoon coming in I'm sorry a new um uh uh armor division coming in

2119
01:42:05.58 --> 01:42:09.02
the we know that the unit that we're there the two to eight that brigade combat team is leaving

2120
01:42:09.02 --> 01:42:14.06
we knew new brigade combat team is coming in and we were actually in just a relative a short

2121
01:42:14.06 --> 01:42:17.74
period of time we were kind of the continuity because all the old guys are leaving we had we had the

2122
01:42:17.74 --> 01:42:21.90
overlap so we had a kind of a prominent role with a new battalion and the new battalion commander

2123
01:42:21.90 --> 01:42:28.30
he's retired now um awesome dude from uh one three seven armor guy named Tedesco just

2124
01:42:28.30 --> 01:42:33.18
an awesome dude just an awesome dude awesome um he would have been there as part of his

2125
01:42:33.18 --> 01:42:37.90
turnover it had come out a couple months prior maybe a month prior and saw us and we had my favorite

2126
01:42:37.90 --> 01:42:44.94
thing about Tedesco is like he said awesome guy we we were getting ready to do a big operation

2127
01:42:44.94 --> 01:42:48.46
with them I think it was the first time we were pushing the south center of our body and we were in his

2128
01:42:48.46 --> 01:42:55.82
briefing and he's quoting pat but he's quoting pat in the movie he's just kidding yeah I was like

2129
01:42:55.82 --> 01:43:01.26
yes yes thank you thank you for bringing me here this day he was awesome and he had seen me

2130
01:43:01.26 --> 01:43:06.38
he just so happened when he was doing his initial turnover before the the the battalion came out

2131
01:43:06.38 --> 01:43:14.14
I had done I had controlled uh um a release I controlled a hellfire and blew up a car and he got

2132
01:43:14.14 --> 01:43:17.90
to see it and it was kind of a cool thing is he comes and he's like who you know who these guys

2133
01:43:17.90 --> 01:43:21.34
uh I'm in the middle of doing a real control happening being the COC that day

2134
01:43:21.98 --> 01:43:25.58
blew up a car it's all in the video get this big TV screens to show the whole thing this card

2135
01:43:25.58 --> 01:43:30.30
detonates and cool pictures and everything and he he comes over to me after we're done I'm kind of

2136
01:43:30.30 --> 01:43:33.98
sitting there and he said Lieutenant Colonel and the major in the hicer he's like can you do that

2137
01:43:33.98 --> 01:43:38.54
when we get here my absolutely man he's like we're gonna get along great that was my

2138
01:43:38.54 --> 01:43:42.54
initial inter-inter-actual with him so it was awesome and so we knew when they were coming back we

2139
01:43:42.54 --> 01:43:46.22
had already just to virtually that experience built some pretty good inroads of them and we

2140
01:43:46.22 --> 01:43:51.10
are gonna do some good work he was also the type of guy look there's this is a whole brigade

2141
01:43:51.10 --> 01:43:55.66
combat team came in that's 5000 guys but his battalion that group of you know several hundred

2142
01:43:55.66 --> 01:44:00.06
was really the core group that I initially did most of my work with and his approach was if you

2143
01:44:00.06 --> 01:44:06.30
can help us you're on the team they're um same exact attitude he had with us yeah for sure for

2144
01:44:06.30 --> 01:44:10.86
all the enablers so uh they were called the bandits and they had a little bandit pin kind of a

2145
01:44:10.86 --> 01:44:16.70
skull and crosspone's kind of thing you were if you you were I was a bandit teacher just totally

2146
01:44:16.70 --> 01:44:23.34
onboard the team and he treated us like his own guys and that was awesome and so um all the enablers

2147
01:44:23.34 --> 01:44:27.58
we had military we had working dogs we had explosive ordinance disposal we had the angle go

2148
01:44:27.58 --> 01:44:31.58
folks we had the seals in all these different groups from different places that none of them were

2149
01:44:31.58 --> 01:44:36.38
assigned to him but his approach was if you can help my soldiers out you're on your bandit you're on

2150
01:44:36.38 --> 01:44:40.14
the team and everybody's like right on let's do this because that's you need to work with them

2151
01:44:40.14 --> 01:44:46.38
anyway I'm as well make the best of it we started to do a couple of missions and everyone of

2152
01:44:46.38 --> 01:44:51.18
those missions was your teams and my teams uh and I would say probably in the first week or so you

2153
01:44:51.18 --> 01:44:55.02
know I'm guessing a little bit of dates but relatively quick in the first couple of missions

2154
01:44:55.74 --> 01:45:00.30
we are doing the similar things we were bringing support and Overwatch and helping these guys

2155
01:45:00.30 --> 01:45:03.34
through their job which is the exact same thing you guys were doing you know totally different

2156
01:45:03.34 --> 01:45:09.26
ways but ultimately we were supporting these guys I meant my my little building there or one day

2157
01:45:09.26 --> 01:45:14.94
whatever just sitting around prepping for something and in walks lay in Tony you know they

2158
01:45:14.94 --> 01:45:18.06
they drove over from your base which is kind of you know a little bit of a haul around around

2159
01:45:18.06 --> 01:45:24.70
their job and it goes hey man um love to work as you more we find a way that we can work together

2160
01:45:24.70 --> 01:45:28.46
in some of these missions and we got this big mission coming up you want to come down and

2161
01:45:28.46 --> 01:45:34.62
and breathe with us oh yeah absolutely I'd love to go breathe with the seals and be awesome

2162
01:45:34.62 --> 01:45:39.50
thought it would just be the kind of cool one time thing I could see how seals do the business um and

2163
01:45:39.50 --> 01:45:43.82
that was it that was his introduction had lathe and Tony I'll be really candid I'd like to think

2164
01:45:43.82 --> 01:45:48.30
I would have done that I doubt I would have gone to shark base and knocked on your door and said hey

2165
01:45:48.30 --> 01:45:53.18
lathe jacca let's do some work together he made that initial contact and him and Tony were

2166
01:45:53.18 --> 01:45:58.22
definitely equal opportunity employers exactly and we the same thing as you know Colonel Tadesco

2167
01:45:58.22 --> 01:46:02.38
if we thought someone could do something to help us out or we could complement each other in any

2168
01:46:02.38 --> 01:46:07.42
way man we were knocking on doors to to try and make that happen for sure yeah and that was his

2169
01:46:07.42 --> 01:46:12.86
approach um I didn't I'd never done any work on the ground I didn't know much about the seals

2170
01:46:12.86 --> 01:46:19.02
I'll be very blunt I had my own opinion of what I assumed you guys would be like and it was

2171
01:46:19.02 --> 01:46:23.50
probably something out of the movies expected like long beards and do's just running around doing

2172
01:46:23.50 --> 01:46:28.06
their own thing uh and so I was actually a little surprised that that lathe came and asked to do

2173
01:46:28.06 --> 01:46:33.26
some work with us and so I I went to that first night mission uh that first brief I don't want

2174
01:46:33.26 --> 01:46:38.46
to say I was skeptical but I was certainly interested in what because my fear was that you guys

2175
01:46:38.46 --> 01:46:42.06
are going to go do your own thing and my guys are kind of just either not be able to keep up

2176
01:46:42.06 --> 01:46:45.74
not know what you're doing and not fit in very well and be able to help out and just kind of put

2177
01:46:45.74 --> 01:46:53.90
ourselves at risk and and look I'll I'll say this very bluntly I have a very high bar when you

2178
01:46:53.90 --> 01:46:58.22
leave Top Gunna what to expect from a mission brief and mission execution a mission debrief because that's

2179
01:46:58.22 --> 01:47:02.22
what we're all about and I was pretty sure that there's no chance that you're going to do anything

2180
01:47:02.22 --> 01:47:11.10
anywhere near that and I was shocked and kind of overwhelmed at how professional your

2181
01:47:11.10 --> 01:47:15.26
organ at your team was and that was the biggest thing for me was what are these guys going to be like

2182
01:47:15.26 --> 01:47:19.82
I just sort of picture day kind of a pickup game hit us go there and just you know kill some

2183
01:47:19.82 --> 01:47:23.66
bad guys and come on back and high five each other and dude it was one of the most professional

2184
01:47:23.66 --> 01:47:28.14
organized mission briefs I totally understood what your plan was I knew exactly what I was going to fit in

2185
01:47:28.14 --> 01:47:32.22
we went and did it and then you guys debriefed after we came back after this it was a relative

2186
01:47:32.22 --> 01:47:36.30
on event nothing really happened that night in terms of in the grand scheme of things that we saw

2187
01:47:36.30 --> 01:47:41.10
over there and then you debriefed it you guys came back and you mission debriefed user there

2188
01:47:41.10 --> 01:47:47.50
kind of clean a weapons and going through and analyzing what happened and that was it man I was totally

2189
01:47:47.50 --> 01:47:52.38
on board I was I was I was I was sold that we could work together like pretty effectively

2190
01:47:52.38 --> 01:47:56.38
and that was kind of the beginning it just sort of started out of the blue and you guys

2191
01:47:56.38 --> 01:48:03.66
came down and asked to do some good work and we did a lot of work you're team did a lot of work with us

2192
01:48:03.66 --> 01:48:08.54
because we we started to think because for our from our perspective and I know there's one

2193
01:48:08.54 --> 01:48:12.78
junior officer out there who's now probably a lieutenant commander or maybe even a commander at this

2194
01:48:12.78 --> 01:48:17.74
point but at that time you know he was on his first deployment and he was a jaytah what we call

2195
01:48:17.74 --> 01:48:22.94
in the seal teams are air controllers are called a jaytah and so here he is and some of those

2196
01:48:22.94 --> 01:48:28.06
missions instead of being a seal he's being a jaytah so he's one of those guys that looked over it

2197
01:48:28.06 --> 01:48:32.22
you guys and said hey wait a second can you take this radio for me and do that thing so I can go

2198
01:48:32.22 --> 01:48:40.38
do my frogman stuff over here and that at and plus again to be blunt you guys could do it a lot

2199
01:48:40.38 --> 01:48:45.58
better than we could period you know we you know you were an F-18 pilot for crying out loud

2200
01:48:45.58 --> 01:48:49.90
and we had a new guy junior officer on the radio trying to call for five you guys are just

2201
01:48:49.90 --> 01:48:56.30
imminently better qualified to do it and so yeah we looked at it as if okay we that gives us one

2202
01:48:56.30 --> 01:49:01.18
more shooter and it gives us a whole new level of expertise now of course there's jaytah

2203
01:49:01.18 --> 01:49:06.22
and the seal teams that they are a lot more experience and they are awesome and of course but in our

2204
01:49:06.22 --> 01:49:12.46
group you to bring you guys was just a huge level up for us to get a lot better and give us more

2205
01:49:12.46 --> 01:49:19.18
people to maneuver as seals on assaults or on Overwatch or whatever so it turned out to be a

2206
01:49:19.82 --> 01:49:25.98
real good little little relationship that I got going there it was a classic win win when when a

2207
01:49:25.98 --> 01:49:32.06
seal says hey would you control the air so I can go shoot people you know and that means I'm no I don't

2208
01:49:32.06 --> 01:49:36.54
have to clear that room and being a position where I might have to do something like that I'm all over

2209
01:49:36.54 --> 01:49:40.78
and I yeah I know you're talking about we had a he and I had a great relationship someone that I

2210
01:49:40.78 --> 01:49:46.54
really loved working with who wanted to go be a frogman like you said I wanted to go control

2211
01:49:46.54 --> 01:49:54.30
their plants and we found a way to make that stuff work now it was it was a big deal for me though

2212
01:49:54.30 --> 01:50:01.90
man to to for me and my guys to work with you guys because you've said this on the podcast and I know

2213
01:50:02.62 --> 01:50:07.18
I know how organizations can we're not necessarily perocule that we don't trust other people

2214
01:50:07.18 --> 01:50:12.54
but we get really comfortable how we do business and to just bring in another group of dudes I think

2215
01:50:12.54 --> 01:50:17.26
this also speaks volumes to the desk and all those guys you're gonna just you want to make sure

2216
01:50:17.26 --> 01:50:23.42
those guys can keep up you know and everybody knows that you guys are legit man and to keep up you

2217
01:50:23.42 --> 01:50:26.62
got you're not to keep up you're not to carry your own weight and you're gonna have to make it happen

2218
01:50:26.62 --> 01:50:30.46
you're gonna have to provide something because the minute you become a drain on the on the team

2219
01:50:31.66 --> 01:50:36.22
you know you're gonna get cut loose and we we couldn't afford to be a drain on you and we couldn't

2220
01:50:36.22 --> 01:50:40.38
afford to have other people be a drain on us so I think there's a lot of kind of at the beginning of

2221
01:50:41.10 --> 01:50:45.58
there's there are a lot of reasons why it wouldn't have worked there's a whole bunch of reasons why it wouldn't have

2222
01:50:45.58 --> 01:50:49.74
worked and the only reason it did work is that everybody was committed to building a relationship to support

2223
01:50:50.62 --> 01:50:55.02
the battalion that was it we all have the same end state in mind it wasn't about what can the seals do to be

2224
01:50:55.02 --> 01:50:58.78
seals and be great that you know what can we do to support those guys yeah well this is a whole thing I was

2225
01:50:58.78 --> 01:51:04.22
opening up with that's sort of where that came from it's just this attitude that everybody there was on the same

2226
01:51:04.22 --> 01:51:10.62
team straight up on the same team and so then that turned into big missions you know big missions

2227
01:51:10.62 --> 01:51:16.30
pushing into Ramadi putting in the combat outpost you know night after night after night

2228
01:51:16.30 --> 01:51:23.58
day after day doing those those big operations and that relationship just got just got stronger and stronger

2229
01:51:23.58 --> 01:51:30.54
you know lay obviously with you and and just turned into something really

2230
01:51:30.54 --> 01:51:40.54
we not just not just cool but man effective yeah effective it was I mean in that deployment I

2231
01:51:40.54 --> 01:51:45.50
kept along journal like I took a lot of notes on my experience there and I've gone back and

2232
01:51:45.50 --> 01:51:50.94
we read it a few times and I've somewhat recently throughout that whole thing one of the common

2233
01:51:50.94 --> 01:51:59.18
themes is how the the lathe and I did this today are we did stuff with you all the time and it

2234
01:51:59.18 --> 01:52:05.10
kind of became in that middle that kind of June July August I mean that was all we were really doing

2235
01:52:05.10 --> 01:52:10.78
because we were so busy and the big up was kicking off and we were starting to get into downtown

2236
01:52:10.78 --> 01:52:16.86
but you know you never been all these clearing all this stuff and so the need for us to support

2237
01:52:16.86 --> 01:52:20.94
the army the need for you to support the army again we could have had ten times many of folks and

2238
01:52:20.94 --> 01:52:26.14
we've probably still could have done more work um everything in that journal it's just about what we're

2239
01:52:26.14 --> 01:52:30.46
doing together I think at the time I just kind of lost track of it because we were just every day

2240
01:52:30.46 --> 01:52:34.38
get up and go do something I mean there's no down days there was hardly ever any time we weren't doing

2241
01:52:34.38 --> 01:52:43.50
anything and it was almost always with you guys and it was a huge highlight for me to to to be with

2242
01:52:43.50 --> 01:52:50.30
a group of guys that were so on board with just making things happen you guys had an incredible

2243
01:52:50.30 --> 01:52:56.94
Mac of this is in the way or this process keeps it yeah we got that sort of down hey I need to get air

2244
01:52:56.94 --> 01:53:01.90
points uh that what yeah did to do this and this you had no no we get we get this sort of out so

2245
01:53:02.46 --> 01:53:07.18
you guys had kind of had cornered the market on what do you need will make we'll get it will make it happen

2246
01:53:07.18 --> 01:53:12.86
and for me to be able to get that asset sort of delivered that I could and you did all the work

2247
01:53:12.86 --> 01:53:16.94
to get it but I can control the hell out of it right on man I didn't have do any of the work to

2248
01:53:16.94 --> 01:53:21.26
explain why I needed this because you guys did all that work and you had a valid reason for it they

2249
01:53:21.26 --> 01:53:26.22
were laughing at me if I said I wanted an AC 130 gunship like who are you I'm Dave Burke man and

2250
01:53:26.22 --> 01:53:31.74
like negative lathe and jocca need an AC 130 gunship not every time you know obviously there's a

2251
01:53:31.74 --> 01:53:34.70
thin asset but that thing should have over head and then you get the guy we were talking about

2252
01:53:34.70 --> 01:53:39.18
like you want to control this I'm like yes I do I want to control this thing so there's a lot of

2253
01:53:39.18 --> 01:53:44.62
mutual benefit there and I think we also proved is I think for the battalion and the brigade they

2254
01:53:44.62 --> 01:53:48.70
figured out that we were really helpful in helping those guys accomplish what they wanted to accomplish

2255
01:53:48.70 --> 01:53:52.94
and that was just I'm not putting very good words to it right now but as obviously real rewarding

2256
01:53:52.94 --> 01:53:58.14
and it was a highlight of that deployment is our ability to work together through like I said

2257
01:53:58.14 --> 01:54:01.66
there's a whole laundry list of reasons why we shouldn't have been able to do this a bunch you didn't

2258
01:54:01.66 --> 01:54:06.14
work for me I didn't have rank you you're guy there's just a whole bunch institutional roadblocks

2259
01:54:06.14 --> 01:54:09.02
that we could just stay in our own corners and our own thing and you and I could have never met

2260
01:54:09.02 --> 01:54:13.50
and that wouldn't have really been all that uncommon you would have just been optimal

2261
01:54:15.82 --> 01:54:22.70
it worked out man yeah a lot of awesome highlights all that deployment and obviously

2262
01:54:24.30 --> 01:54:30.70
some of the worst days of our lives are over there June 20th

2263
01:54:30.70 --> 01:54:41.74
talking about that yeah man so obviously I know we're gonna talk about this

2264
01:54:43.74 --> 01:54:48.06
so we had been there quite a bit and I remember kind of the shock when we first got there talking

2265
01:54:48.06 --> 01:54:54.14
to the two to eight I had my first am there I go to Alfa company and they've got them a memorial outside

2266
01:54:54.14 --> 01:54:58.70
of their compound of all the soldiers that had been killed I can picture it's just kind of like a

2267
01:54:58.70 --> 01:55:03.90
names are on a little placard and it's kind of a tall little pyramid looking thing with the

2268
01:55:03.90 --> 01:55:11.10
names on there and you see it you understand it hey people have died here you get it it's not hard

2269
01:55:11.10 --> 01:55:16.14
to to understand that those things have happened but there's this a level of disconnect when you

2270
01:55:16.14 --> 01:55:21.18
first get there like people are dying but you know you haven't seen it and then you know very

2271
01:55:21.18 --> 01:55:26.54
quick I think probably my second mission out there was kind of a QRF from a vehicle ID so basically

2272
01:55:26.54 --> 01:55:32.46
I'm in a surgeon with a bunch of bombs in his vehicles got on between American Compo and

2273
01:55:32.46 --> 01:55:38.14
blew himself up so I see my first dead body you know I see this real combat people are dying

2274
01:55:38.14 --> 01:55:47.82
here it was an enemy wasn't the same and then you know March April May we started taking I mean

2275
01:55:47.82 --> 01:55:51.98
not started we continue to take casualties and I'm starting to go to memorials and we're starting to

2276
01:55:51.98 --> 01:55:56.30
see guys that we knew and worked with and were friends with and built relations with and

2277
01:55:56.30 --> 01:56:01.26
they're they're they're getting killed or really gravely wounded and those memorials started to

2278
01:56:01.26 --> 01:56:06.54
become every couple of days we're going to a memorial and that sort of ways on you I thought about

2279
01:56:06.54 --> 01:56:10.54
this a lot and how it affected me you know it's a pilot being out of my comfort zone in this environment

2280
01:56:10.54 --> 01:56:18.78
and what that was like but without trying to diminish any of that loss

2281
01:56:18.78 --> 01:56:27.58
there's a there's a disconnect when it's not your person it's not your guy and on June 20th

2282
01:56:28.14 --> 01:56:34.38
so Chris Leon who was my radio operator we were in a building that we had been in let me back up I was

2283
01:56:34.38 --> 01:56:39.34
not there I had left that building that morning gone back to the CUC Adam's team with Chris had

2284
01:56:39.34 --> 01:56:43.74
replaced us and we're basically just going back and forth operations and this this combat outpost

2285
01:56:43.74 --> 01:56:48.62
because it gave us a really good view of the north part of the city and we had to be there basically

2286
01:56:48.62 --> 01:56:54.30
24 seven and and Chris and and Adam's team had gone back out there and they were supposed to go

2287
01:56:54.30 --> 01:56:58.22
from like 12 to 4 something like that I don't know what it was we gave him like a six-hour shift or

2288
01:56:58.22 --> 01:57:03.50
something and then we were going to kind of figure out if we replace or start over we just sort of

2289
01:57:04.38 --> 01:57:08.14
sent him out there and we're going to come back a little bit and I got to call on the radio

2290
01:57:08.62 --> 01:57:12.78
from the battalion saying hey can you extend your angle go team out here for four hours we're going to

2291
01:57:12.78 --> 01:57:17.18
go do another movement to do some clearing again rush of that hey Adam can you guys stay out

2292
01:57:17.18 --> 01:57:21.90
for another couple hours you know support we're going to get you what not you know standard answer

2293
01:57:21.90 --> 01:57:30.46
yeah Roger that no problem and during that time it was not uncommon to take fire and from that

2294
01:57:30.46 --> 01:57:39.02
in that OP and there was some sniper fire and the first shot there was a younger marina lands

2295
01:57:39.02 --> 01:57:44.94
corporal who was up there and Chris ran up from the other side and kind of put him down you know

2296
01:57:44.94 --> 01:57:49.82
say hey once you get down take cover go go over the other side of the building and Chris got up

2297
01:57:50.38 --> 01:57:56.86
to start to he was doing his observation to try to figure out what was going on and Chris was shot by

2298
01:57:56.86 --> 01:58:04.70
sniper and I get a call kind of very closely after that from Adam you know I'm kind of man in

2299
01:58:04.70 --> 01:58:09.18
the radio's all the time anyway even our home will base there like we're we had a radio right there

2300
01:58:09.18 --> 01:58:14.94
so I was never really not there I was just on the radio say hey corporal landsman hit we're on a

2301
01:58:14.94 --> 01:58:21.82
way back and I was about it I didn't have any real good sense of anything was going on and um

2302
01:58:23.18 --> 01:58:29.18
a little panic sets in like okay and I don't want to press for too much information I get a call

2303
01:58:29.18 --> 01:58:34.38
from alpha company who would who'd manned all the observation posts between where he was and where

2304
01:58:34.38 --> 01:58:37.66
we were that they were clearing make sure the roads were clear they're using their tanks and

2305
01:58:37.66 --> 01:58:41.26
their radlies so they could pick him up and bring a straight shot because that was a pretty busy

2306
01:58:41.26 --> 01:58:46.06
dangerous road you always had to look out for ideas and stuff like that and so everybody's kind of

2307
01:58:46.06 --> 01:58:51.66
picking up the pace to clear out that road and he's coming back and I get a call hey he's breathing

2308
01:58:52.22 --> 01:58:58.70
we're heading straight to Charlie Med and I'm like all right okay I kind of had this sense of this

2309
01:58:58.70 --> 01:59:06.62
is going to be okay Charlie Med is this medical facility on the the camp that we were stationed at

2310
01:59:06.62 --> 01:59:11.66
there and was literally a hundred yards from where I slept and I just ran down to Charlie Med

2311
01:59:11.66 --> 01:59:16.46
to meet the humbill I was there and I'm sorry it wasn't humbill it was a Bradley about the fighting

2312
01:59:16.46 --> 01:59:24.06
vehicle Bradley pulls up myself and my my corpsman dock are there the the the Bradley has a door

2313
01:59:24.06 --> 01:59:29.26
on the back of the body that comes down like a ramp and the ramp comes down he's on a stretcher

2314
01:59:30.14 --> 01:59:34.22
dock goes up to get the front piece of the stretcher I'm at the bottom and he comes down

2315
01:59:34.22 --> 01:59:39.74
carrying the stretcher and Chris is laying on the stretcher and I he went right by my look

2316
01:59:39.74 --> 01:59:46.06
at a minute immediately that he was gone I mean it was gone it was I could see the entrance

2317
01:59:46.06 --> 01:59:49.42
who ended the whole thing was all kind of they had stabilized and they had done their best to kind of

2318
01:59:49.42 --> 01:59:54.62
manage the wood but there was no question that the outcome had already played itself out and Chris was

2319
01:59:54.62 --> 02:00:00.46
gone they take a man to the medical facility which I'd been in and you've been in a dozen times

2320
02:00:00.46 --> 02:00:05.18
for a whole host of different reasons but it always been somebody else I mean I may have known

2321
02:00:05.18 --> 02:00:10.94
that person and been close to that person but it was always somebody else and dock goes in with

2322
02:00:10.94 --> 02:00:14.86
him he's carrying the stretcher and he comes out and probably jack was quite 10 seconds and he just

2323
02:00:14.86 --> 02:00:21.02
comes out with the head shaken and I knew I wasn't holding my breath or I knew but he kind of came

2324
02:00:21.02 --> 02:00:25.50
out and and just sort of I guess confirmed if that's the word I'm looking forward to sort of

2325
02:00:25.50 --> 02:00:36.94
made it official that that Chris had been killed and it sort of initiated just a very strange kind

2326
02:00:36.94 --> 02:00:42.22
of very sequence of events so I I knew Adam and the rest of team were trying to get back and

2327
02:00:42.22 --> 02:00:45.50
they're going to have a slower road back because they're not going to get the support it's just

2328
02:00:45.50 --> 02:00:48.86
going to take a little more time going to get their gear and all the things go along with

2329
02:00:48.86 --> 02:00:53.02
that Chris just got loaded in the humbian and racing back and Bradley they're kind of loaded up

2330
02:00:53.02 --> 02:00:57.82
their humbians and it's just going to take some time and I know like I need to get back to the vehicle

2331
02:00:57.82 --> 02:01:02.06
we parked our trucks because I want to meet them there and I walk back like I said it was maybe

2332
02:01:02.06 --> 02:01:07.26
100 yards from my hooch to Charlie Man and I get about halfway there and I had this thought that

2333
02:01:08.70 --> 02:01:15.10
that I maybe didn't confirm that Chris was killed and so I actually walked all the way back

2334
02:01:15.10 --> 02:01:19.74
to go find there's a senior medical officer we called him the smoke really awesome guy that dealt

2335
02:01:19.74 --> 02:01:24.62
with all the casualties there who I knew because I had done control I had controlled helicopter

2336
02:01:24.62 --> 02:01:29.26
cast of acts on wounded folks I've been there a lot we did we get blood I mean we were in that facility

2337
02:01:29.26 --> 02:01:39.66
all the time and I I don't know why I needed to do it but I was I I'm just I had a talk

2338
02:01:39.66 --> 02:01:46.94
I'm gonna say is is is is is is is he is he killed is like yeah I'm sorry man you know

2339
02:01:46.94 --> 02:01:50.70
it was kind of an odd conversation I could tell the why he was looking like why I ask him

2340
02:01:50.70 --> 02:01:55.18
this question like it just was one of those things and I was in sort of I think it's a stage

2341
02:01:55.18 --> 02:01:59.18
of disbelief that as I walked back and I was going to deliver the news I had sort of told

2342
02:01:59.18 --> 02:02:03.34
myself like I can't tell them in case what if I'm wrong because I never really went through that

2343
02:02:04.70 --> 02:02:09.74
I saw him I saw Doc but there were no words or exchange and I had this very odd like walking

2344
02:02:09.74 --> 02:02:15.58
back and forth a couple of times and kind of sorting it out and then you know my job was

2345
02:02:15.58 --> 02:02:20.14
next thing I had to do is I Adam I watched the trucks pull up they all get out you know four

2346
02:02:20.14 --> 02:02:24.86
guys and everybody else had heard you know all the angle code teams that were there and we shared

2347
02:02:24.86 --> 02:02:29.42
a facility with EOD and working with everybody you know where did it was passed something had

2348
02:02:29.42 --> 02:02:39.90
happened and I you know a corphing on corphing on stead you know we do something called

2349
02:02:39.90 --> 02:02:46.06
a hero flight and a hero flight is going to be like 1600 I got the information like 10 minutes

2350
02:02:46.62 --> 02:02:52.86
the process of them bringing a casualty that casualty not surviving and then moving they had

2351
02:02:52.86 --> 02:02:58.78
that thing wired and I'd seen it done a bunch of times but it just it was Chris it was my guy

2352
02:02:58.78 --> 02:03:02.14
he was a guy that I just knew differently than everybody else I just saw him differently

2353
02:03:02.78 --> 02:03:07.02
when we entered our trucks he was the back left and I was the front right and our trucks are always

2354
02:03:07.02 --> 02:03:11.82
parked back into their spots so they're always side by side so the back left of his truck

2355
02:03:11.82 --> 02:03:17.34
entered door and the right front of my truck door we always had a fight space for each other

2356
02:03:17.90 --> 02:03:22.14
you know Chris was a standard perfect Marine like he could be 90% of the way through if he

2357
02:03:22.14 --> 02:03:25.50
saw me walking up he'd get out of the way close the door to let me in on my cockman dude like just

2358
02:03:25.50 --> 02:03:31.74
he was a great Marine just I walked past that kid without even really talking him you know a thousand

2359
02:03:31.74 --> 02:03:41.98
times just every single day a couple of times a day and it demystifies as a Marine

2360
02:03:44.06 --> 02:03:49.50
you just live a slightly bit for me I shouldn't say you how it felt for me as I just felt

2361
02:03:50.22 --> 02:03:54.30
with all that was going on and all the destruction and the death and the violence and all the

2362
02:03:54.30 --> 02:03:58.54
things that I'd sort of become accustomed to at that point there's just an aspect of it that's just

2363
02:03:58.54 --> 02:04:04.62
a tiny bit insulated in your life to a really small degree but it's enough to just keep you

2364
02:04:04.62 --> 02:04:14.30
sort of preserved and when Chris was killed it just sort of exposed that it broke down one of my

2365
02:04:14.30 --> 02:04:21.50
last little boundary of I'm I'm okay here because I can do this because I'm gonna get through this I'm

2366
02:04:21.50 --> 02:04:32.38
gonna go home and everything's gonna be okay and that hurt a lot that hurt in ways that I did not

2367
02:04:32.38 --> 02:04:38.38
understand how it was gonna hurt I just didn't I just didn't know what that was gonna be like

2368
02:04:39.74 --> 02:04:44.62
and the the all those next steps and you I know you know this because you you saw it

2369
02:04:44.62 --> 02:04:51.26
he's on a helicopter and he's gone flying away in that 46 in what feels like about a minute

2370
02:04:51.26 --> 02:04:57.74
it's ours and our even rehearsed the movement onto the to carry him onto the hell but

2371
02:04:58.54 --> 02:05:02.22
you go from Chris's city is on his way into watching the helicopter fly away and it feels like

2372
02:05:02.22 --> 02:05:07.90
it takes about that long and then you're just sort of left and you walk back you literally walk away

2373
02:05:07.90 --> 02:05:11.50
from the medical facility where the helicopter just takes off and you walk back on to your original

2374
02:05:11.50 --> 02:05:17.74
you just go back to your room only Chris has gone and it's like that whole deployment kind of

2375
02:05:17.74 --> 02:05:22.22
re I don't know what the right word is it's like I had to start the deployment again because

2376
02:05:22.22 --> 02:05:25.50
all the things that I was dealing with and all things that I was managing and leading is as

2377
02:05:25.50 --> 02:05:31.34
it's a leader would know whatever you want to say was my job it all is sort of change in terms of

2378
02:05:32.14 --> 02:05:40.06
what I thought really well the guys that I was working with everything was different now because it was

2379
02:05:40.06 --> 02:05:45.58
their brother that was gone not somebody else and it's just sort of changed the calculus and

2380
02:05:45.58 --> 02:05:52.22
it really redefined the rest of that deployment and I'll be really really blunt it was hard for me

2381
02:05:53.18 --> 02:05:58.78
to not fold and there was a lot of instinct of like I do not want to do this anymore I do not want

2382
02:05:58.78 --> 02:06:04.30
to be here this is more than I had bargained for and this we can laugh about volunteering and

2383
02:06:04.30 --> 02:06:11.42
being a Marie you know it was a little more than I bargained for and look man we had done some crazy

2384
02:06:11.42 --> 02:06:15.74
stuff at that point and I'd seen some bad things happen I was a participant in some bad things

2385
02:06:16.70 --> 02:06:22.14
and I was okay I was doing okay and I was gonna be okay with that and this one just sort of

2386
02:06:23.66 --> 02:06:28.30
I just it's I struggled with it a little bit so it was a tough day man

2387
02:06:28.30 --> 02:06:37.66
yeah and obviously you know for for us it was you know what a month and a half later

2388
02:06:38.46 --> 02:06:43.74
on August 2nd when Mark got killed and you know I think that's one of the things that

2389
02:06:44.78 --> 02:06:49.26
that we felt you know that little bit of insulation that you're talking about

2390
02:06:50.78 --> 02:06:57.26
we felt that we felt I would say I would say actually more insulated because

2391
02:06:57.26 --> 02:07:03.18
you know my guys were out there taking massive risks getting in crazy gun fights

2392
02:07:03.98 --> 02:07:09.26
getting after it to a degree that no one had ever thought they would and we were doing all right we

2393
02:07:09.26 --> 02:07:14.38
had a couple guys get wounded here and there but they were okay and honestly that guys getting wounded

2394
02:07:14.38 --> 02:07:20.62
you know it's not a devastating wound I mean I had you know one of my guys got wounded early on and

2395
02:07:20.62 --> 02:07:25.58
he almost lost his leg but guess what he didn't and that that didn't make us feel more vulnerable

2396
02:07:25.58 --> 02:07:31.66
in my mind it made us feel stronger and like hey we might get wounded but what we're gonna be good

2397
02:07:32.30 --> 02:07:36.30
and so yeah when Mark got killed and especially Mark who was you know such a

2398
02:07:36.94 --> 02:07:43.26
gargarius and such a guy so full of life that you don't think he can be killed you don't think

2399
02:07:43.26 --> 02:07:49.66
he can be killed and same thing you know that insulation was just completely shattered and I think

2400
02:07:49.66 --> 02:08:00.06
what was also it was it was recognizable it was recognizable to me was that other people outside of

2401
02:08:00.06 --> 02:08:07.74
task munibrusor they fought the same thing they fought hey the seals are here they're gonna they're

2402
02:08:07.74 --> 02:08:12.30
they're gonna they're gonna push through this they're gonna they're gonna win and there nothing's

2403
02:08:12.30 --> 02:08:18.62
gonna happen to them and we saw it you know at the memorial service you could see in guys faces that

2404
02:08:18.62 --> 02:08:27.10
they were they were also their insulation about us was was kind of shattered too and then it

2405
02:08:27.10 --> 02:08:34.14
turns into damn if the seals can get killed where am I at I think that was another thing that

2406
02:08:34.14 --> 02:08:37.90
that really you know that was another thing that really just made Mark get and killed such a

2407
02:08:38.62 --> 02:08:44.94
such an impact to all of us there there's no doubt that what you just said is exactly how

2408
02:08:44.94 --> 02:08:51.98
it played out you were the first guy to talk to me when Chris's helicopter flies away it's

2409
02:08:51.98 --> 02:08:56.46
literally dusty and you know the helicopter's loud and it kicks up dust there and it was dark it was

2410
02:08:56.46 --> 02:09:02.38
nighttime and you came up to me and I don't remember the exact words but we were just turning around

2411
02:09:02.38 --> 02:09:07.02
and walking back and you said something like we're gonna get after this guys and we're gonna

2412
02:09:07.02 --> 02:09:11.74
go find the cybersitter doing this something to those wars and it was basically like we're

2413
02:09:11.74 --> 02:09:19.58
gonna take care of this and I remember feeling really comforted by that like yeah man yeah go do

2414
02:09:19.58 --> 02:09:25.34
that that's awesome and feeling good about that that we weren't helpless and we're just gonna

2415
02:09:25.34 --> 02:09:30.54
suck it up and deal with this just this terrible loss that we're gonna get something from this

2416
02:09:30.54 --> 02:09:36.14
we're gonna go find some guys and go get after it and we're gonna go kill these guys and you

2417
02:09:36.14 --> 02:09:41.42
guys we're gonna you guys are gonna make that happen and I remember feeling I remember how that

2418
02:09:41.42 --> 02:09:47.10
felt and look June 20th August 2nd just like everything else was a blur man it was like

2419
02:09:47.10 --> 02:09:52.70
it might as well just been the next day because things happened so fast there and I was

2420
02:09:53.98 --> 02:09:58.70
you know I wasn't on the patrol on the on August 2nd but I was on the radio I was

2421
02:09:58.70 --> 02:10:02.46
got to run in the air I was doing all the same stuff we always did you know and I was back in

2422
02:10:02.46 --> 02:10:08.38
the CUC with you working that mission all that stuff that happened and before you know it we're

2423
02:10:08.38 --> 02:10:16.38
watching that helicopter fly away you know or he's gone you know and you and you're seeing

2424
02:10:16.38 --> 02:10:21.02
the the the aftermath of that and I actually went back last night to look at my journal entry

2425
02:10:21.02 --> 02:10:26.06
for that day because I ended up running down Charlie Medigan because that's where everybody came in

2426
02:10:26.06 --> 02:10:29.42
and I remember seeing Lave there you know Lave was a guy I don't work with the ton and

2427
02:10:29.42 --> 02:10:32.70
there he is he's got a wound I'm looking at him over I'm saying over as I told her they kind of

2428
02:10:32.70 --> 02:10:39.98
shirt off they're they're they're attending to Lave who was Lave was a larger than life

2429
02:10:40.54 --> 02:10:44.54
you know for guy like me who always kind of fell to a little bit like what the hell am I doing

2430
02:10:44.54 --> 02:10:50.86
her man without my doing with the seals like this isn't sane these guys are just they're just

2431
02:10:50.86 --> 02:10:59.50
larger than life and to see the exposure of that it bothered me and I knew I had the feeling of

2432
02:10:59.50 --> 02:11:05.42
holy cow if this can happen to these guys you know can happen any of us and it's not a good

2433
02:11:05.42 --> 02:11:08.46
feeling and when you saw the guys from the team who it was just it was just everything was

2434
02:11:08.46 --> 02:11:12.46
scrambling and it was just that sense of and I don't want to make a sound like it wasn't

2435
02:11:12.46 --> 02:11:17.34
a pain nobody's panicking or freaking out it was not like that but it was just a tiny bit

2436
02:11:18.06 --> 02:11:23.26
chaotic that makes sense on a small degree but enough when you were so used to just being

2437
02:11:23.26 --> 02:11:30.62
completely not like that that feeling like when Chris loss was it what I felt was like

2438
02:11:31.58 --> 02:11:36.86
oh man I'm not really in good chill any of this I am not in control all that stuff that I've told

2439
02:11:36.86 --> 02:11:42.70
myself all that comfort and confidence and we're getting better and I'm gonna be more effective

2440
02:11:42.70 --> 02:11:49.98
and do more good work until the thing is over it was like no negative that could be you that could

2441
02:11:49.98 --> 02:12:00.14
happen today and then it and between Chris and Mark the army suffered oh I'm God bless we

2442
02:12:00.14 --> 02:12:04.62
are going to memorials like every couple of days people are getting killed all the time and

2443
02:12:04.62 --> 02:12:10.22
everyone of those you wrote that that confidence a little bit and when it happened to Mark and

2444
02:12:10.22 --> 02:12:20.14
Dave that was hard to see that and it that was the feeling that I had it was like yeah

2445
02:12:23.50 --> 02:12:27.58
maybe I'm just lucky you know maybe I maybe this whole thing is just luck

2446
02:12:29.42 --> 02:12:39.26
now look we we regrouped I mean June 20th was a bad day you know we did all the things

2447
02:12:39.26 --> 02:12:44.78
we did the morning we paid our our we ordered him the right way you guys can't we did it the right way and we

2448
02:12:44.78 --> 02:12:52.86
acknowledged Chris but if you kind of think what's gone in the middle of June man there was no

2449
02:12:52.86 --> 02:12:57.42
taken a knee there was no like let's hold off for a second catcher breath the bullet chain was just

2450
02:12:57.42 --> 02:13:00.78
running and as a matter of fact it was just gonna it was actually just gonna get a ton worse you remember

2451
02:13:00.78 --> 02:13:06.62
July and August were just they were insane they were insane so we we lost Chris really at the

2452
02:13:06.62 --> 02:13:11.02
big ramp up you know we had done a big movement in earlier in June and we were really starting

2453
02:13:11.02 --> 02:13:16.70
to lay into the city but the real you know the crazy jay block you know that kind of stuff all

2454
02:13:16.70 --> 02:13:22.38
that stuff was all out in front of us and so for me it was you know my entire career I've done a

2455
02:13:22.38 --> 02:13:27.58
whole bunch of really great stuff in my career and nothing is even nothing is even it's not anymore talking

2456
02:13:27.58 --> 02:13:33.34
about what anything else in my career has meant compared to that deployment and then that day I mean

2457
02:13:33.34 --> 02:13:40.78
it's just light years different and it was like you gotta get up and go do it the very next

2458
02:13:40.78 --> 02:13:45.66
day and it's a remember going that first patrol that first mission and trying to that feeling of

2459
02:13:46.78 --> 02:13:50.54
okay yeah it's different and you got I think you've got one of two ways to go with that it's either

2460
02:13:50.54 --> 02:13:54.22
gonna get inside your heading kind of mess with you and break you a little bit and and I could feel

2461
02:13:54.22 --> 02:14:00.86
that happening or you just you just you just don't you just shut it down and just go do it

2462
02:14:00.86 --> 02:14:07.26
and I found how to compartmentalize you know I'd come back I'd have moments when I was back

2463
02:14:07.26 --> 02:14:10.78
on my whoochup and the roof by myself I have my moments man no I don't want anybody to think

2464
02:14:10.78 --> 02:14:15.98
that I didn't I had plenty of those moments this is matter fact I I still do to be honest with you

2465
02:14:15.98 --> 02:14:19.98
I still have my moments I go visit Chris her allington on his birthday I go visit Chris and

2466
02:14:19.98 --> 02:14:25.50
that day he was killed I go to visit Chris Memorial Day his mom comes out I see cat she and I

2467
02:14:25.50 --> 02:14:33.82
were very close I have my moments without a doubt but the rest of the three months in Ramadi

2468
02:14:33.82 --> 02:14:38.94
there was just not there wasn't a ton of time to do that so I guess I kind of just saved it

2469
02:14:38.94 --> 02:14:46.62
maybe for for when I came back and it it was there I mean it it's not good but yeah man

2470
02:14:46.62 --> 02:14:57.18
so then you you do come back I mean obviously like you said it ramped up it ramped up all the time

2471
02:14:57.18 --> 02:15:02.86
and the guys were just you know everybody like I'm not just talking about our guys I'm talking

2472
02:15:02.86 --> 02:15:09.98
about everybody it ramped up hardcore it got hotter outside the the the combat got more intense

2473
02:15:09.98 --> 02:15:20.38
the enemy started fighting harder they got more square away and like you said you and the rest of

2474
02:15:20.38 --> 02:15:30.78
the guys there did the mission day after day night after night and then one day you fly home

2475
02:15:30.78 --> 02:15:40.38
yeah and how was that transition for you getting back to the states

2476
02:15:43.10 --> 02:15:49.50
interesting it was an interesting transition so from the time that I left Ramadi

2477
02:15:50.62 --> 02:15:54.30
so you would pack up our stuff we left Ramadi I think we weren't to co-8 for day or two

2478
02:15:54.30 --> 02:16:02.46
went to Lujoon went to Japan because I had to check out both places Jack I think it was six days

2479
02:16:02.46 --> 02:16:06.78
on the calendar from the day I left Ramadi to the day I landed on a plane in San Diego

2480
02:16:08.62 --> 02:16:12.94
which at the time was all I wanted I was the and I've been fairly good about this right my

2481
02:16:12.94 --> 02:16:18.38
career is when I want things to happen administratively I can make those things happen

2482
02:16:18.38 --> 02:16:23.42
but if I catch one that there's a flight from Japan to San Diego and I can get on that flight

2483
02:16:23.42 --> 02:16:26.78
I'm gonna get on that flight even if my CEO is the young me like how did you get out of here so fast

2484
02:16:26.78 --> 02:16:31.26
like I have the same in the guy in the paper and I got to go and I'm out I wanted to get out quickly

2485
02:16:31.66 --> 02:16:37.42
so I found myself in San Diego executing my next orders which the Marine Corps said you go to

2486
02:16:37.42 --> 02:16:41.34
Ramadi you do the fact you're gonna do the fact you're gonna go back to San Diego from there

2487
02:16:42.06 --> 02:16:47.34
which will be your next at order so I knew while I was in Iraq that San Diego was in my future my wife had

2488
02:16:47.34 --> 02:16:51.18
already moved down there I told you she was living with my best friend Neil who was on that

2489
02:16:51.18 --> 02:16:57.74
fact tour before me so I go in Ramadi his battalion comes home we show up my wife and my best friend

2490
02:16:57.74 --> 02:17:02.78
and living together in San Diego which was really good for her because he was able to kind of

2491
02:17:03.66 --> 02:17:08.46
keep her aware of what's going on but knew exactly how to explain it in a way that wasn't

2492
02:17:08.46 --> 02:17:13.42
gonna freak her out and he also took it out so he knew how to downplay hey I would call hey we're

2493
02:17:13.42 --> 02:17:17.58
doing this no big deal I mean I didn't I wasn't telling him half of what the hell was going on I

2494
02:17:17.58 --> 02:17:22.46
wouldn't you not gonna share those stories so he was a really great resource for her I paid very

2495
02:17:22.46 --> 02:17:26.62
little time worrying about it to be honest with you I was comfortable that she had a good

2496
02:17:27.18 --> 02:17:34.70
support structure which she really didn't we we got married I deployed four months later to Ramadi

2497
02:17:34.70 --> 02:17:37.82
she she started dating a dude who was driving a Corvette and living in Tahoe as a top

2498
02:17:37.82 --> 02:17:44.06
owner structure and and four months after we got married I was in Ramadi so there was no like

2499
02:17:44.06 --> 02:17:49.74
easing so I knew there was just I didn't know at the time didn't think of it but it was

2500
02:17:49.74 --> 02:17:54.70
obvious that looking back that she was just thrown into an environment that she was totally unprepared for

2501
02:17:56.30 --> 02:17:59.34
now forget about just me being gone but just the fact that I was in Ramadi and it's all over

2502
02:17:59.34 --> 02:18:02.14
the news everybody knew it was going on I think one of my Marines is killing me a lot of crazy

2503
02:18:02.14 --> 02:18:07.10
stuff going on and next thing you know I'm home September 28 I'm back in San Diego like

2504
02:18:07.10 --> 02:18:13.90
three hundred sixty five days to the day I'm home and I checked into an F-18 squadron like the

2505
02:18:13.90 --> 02:18:20.94
day after I got home before October 1st I was back into an F-18 squadron San Diego which is insane

2506
02:18:23.26 --> 02:18:30.22
and I to be really blunt I was you know all those guys in Anglican went back to Anglican

2507
02:18:30.78 --> 02:18:35.34
and can't push you in can't handsome in in Japan I was like later bros you know like

2508
02:18:35.34 --> 02:18:41.90
no longer buys you know high five great deployment you know I'm out I was just on other things

2509
02:18:41.90 --> 02:18:45.66
and I kind of extricated myself it's you know I fall the rules I do whatever supposed to do and

2510
02:18:45.66 --> 02:18:51.82
before I know it I'm back there and I honestly I think also kind of kidding myself like that was

2511
02:18:51.82 --> 02:18:58.06
the best thing for me let's get home I knew something was a on this because on the drive home

2512
02:18:58.06 --> 02:19:04.54
from the airport I find a San Diego international just down the road my wife and my my mom who lives in

2513
02:19:04.54 --> 02:19:08.14
San Diego both of them came to pick me up from the airport you've already met my mom great lady

2514
02:19:08.14 --> 02:19:11.74
my wife and my mom picked me up from the airport I got pictures of them meeting me there

2515
02:19:11.74 --> 02:19:17.98
getting the car drive from San Diego international to our house in Pacific Beach and as we're

2516
02:19:17.98 --> 02:19:27.82
pulling like on to Chelsea any up to the house I like screamed at them told them stop talking

2517
02:19:27.82 --> 02:19:31.74
or something like that I said something like I don't even I don't know what it was but I

2518
02:19:31.74 --> 02:19:36.78
think I just remember sitting in the passenger seat and some the gears just start I'm in a truck

2519
02:19:36.78 --> 02:19:40.78
or a car I like whenever I don't know what it was but something's going on and I think just

2520
02:19:40.78 --> 02:19:44.70
the pressure is building and I'm and I have no sense of what's going on I know out of for it

2521
02:19:44.70 --> 02:19:51.02
and they're like having a perfectly normal adult conversation that might have been an octave above

2522
02:19:51.02 --> 02:19:56.54
when I was willing to accept her tolerate maybe and I completely freaked out on my wife and my

2523
02:19:56.54 --> 02:20:02.46
mom let's see in the year and you know they were like oh sorry you know they were super cool no push back

2524
02:20:02.46 --> 02:20:10.14
and it was an indicator like yeah you recognize that immediately like oh god yeah immediately

2525
02:20:10.14 --> 02:20:18.14
and it was that combination recognition of that's not good and clearly I have I have things I

2526
02:20:18.14 --> 02:20:23.66
need to deal with that I wasn't quite aware of so I knew no question right away and I think

2527
02:20:23.66 --> 02:20:28.46
about this a lot with other marines and the things you experience in combat you've talked about

2528
02:20:28.46 --> 02:20:33.26
PTSD a lot look that's the subject you could spend hours on the bottom lines everybody deals with

2529
02:20:33.26 --> 02:20:37.66
things differently doesn't mean you're broken or messed it just it just means you have some

2530
02:20:37.66 --> 02:20:41.82
process you gotta go through and you gotta deal with them we all deal with it differently I had

2531
02:20:41.82 --> 02:20:47.90
maybe talk myself into out 33 as fairly experienced guy I was surrounded by very young marines

2532
02:20:47.90 --> 02:20:55.74
who maybe in my mind didn't have maybe the emotional maturity maybe the life skills to maybe

2533
02:20:55.74 --> 02:21:01.18
manage some of these same chaotic things you know guys at saw Chris get shot you know I maybe kind

2534
02:21:01.18 --> 02:21:05.90
of built myself up a little bit as a little better equipped and I was better equipped in my mind

2535
02:21:05.90 --> 02:21:11.58
and I was I in a matter of 45 minutes from the airport to the house I'm flying off the handle

2536
02:21:11.58 --> 02:21:19.66
on something so it just all it was man it was it was those two things like that's not good

2537
02:21:20.46 --> 02:21:24.14
and this is gonna probably happen again I'm gonna need to I'm gonna need to think about this I

2538
02:21:24.14 --> 02:21:29.02
can't pretend like I'm not gonna just have some sort of residual you can't leave Ramadi

2539
02:21:29.02 --> 02:21:32.70
being San Diego six days later and not bring some baggage home with you and I was bringing some

2540
02:21:32.70 --> 02:21:43.58
baggage home and there's some baggage there a little bit so that transition was was it started

2541
02:21:43.58 --> 02:21:48.22
is there anything that like anything that helped you yeah dude I'll tell you what helped the most

2542
02:21:48.22 --> 02:21:54.86
is my best friend who had been in Ramadi and endured all of that loss the look our story you know

2543
02:21:54.86 --> 02:21:59.42
the the guys that we replaced the guys that replaced us it's a very similar story a lot they understand

2544
02:21:59.42 --> 02:22:04.46
that you know I think having an outlet having one other dude it happened to be my best friend

2545
02:22:04.46 --> 02:22:10.06
super 14 so it was you want to talk about just hitting the jackpot and being the best equipped

2546
02:22:10.06 --> 02:22:14.30
sort of just deal and power through it and and and accept what's going on and and embrace it and

2547
02:22:14.30 --> 02:22:19.34
all those things that go on with it I had an outlet man I had my best friend who I mean he knew

2548
02:22:19.34 --> 02:22:24.46
every place we were I mean it wasn't even like oh he was here now it was the same place yeah

2549
02:22:24.46 --> 02:22:28.38
because Ramadi's not that big it's just not that big man and so we say I was on the corner

2550
02:22:28.38 --> 02:22:35.50
of sunset mission is like yeah there are 500 times yeah and and he was struggling a little bit

2551
02:22:35.50 --> 02:22:41.42
too you know again I it's all relative I mean we're handled it relatively okay you know I'm going

2552
02:22:41.42 --> 02:22:45.42
back to kind of dealing in normal life and but the moment when you get those little spikes and those

2553
02:22:45.42 --> 02:22:49.58
is what kind of comes up and get you those little spikes was a sort of unforeseen kind of reactions

2554
02:22:50.30 --> 02:22:53.90
he could see that in me and I could see that in him we had actually been really we're really good

2555
02:22:53.90 --> 02:22:58.78
for each other when I see him kind of get a little shaky a little break like I'm not you know he's

2556
02:22:58.78 --> 02:23:02.86
not digging his environment a little bit or he'd see that of me you had that other person I kind

2557
02:23:02.86 --> 02:23:09.66
of bring you back to helping you helping you deal with that which is good the flip side of that

2558
02:23:09.66 --> 02:23:15.82
while it was really helpful for him to be there I think it was really tough on Whitney because she

2559
02:23:15.82 --> 02:23:21.02
was not my outlet for that I wasn't kind of got cut out totally and not I didn't certainly not

2560
02:23:21.02 --> 02:23:25.50
by design I'm not like doing this calculation if I don't want my head she's not I'm not going to

2561
02:23:25.50 --> 02:23:28.86
use her as a resource you know for that and to be honest with you too there's also a little part

2562
02:23:28.86 --> 02:23:34.70
of you know what the corner of Michigan sunset is like so totally man and I'll I'll be really

2563
02:23:34.70 --> 02:23:41.10
candid you know I I think I would have been almost embarrassed is maybe not the right word but I

2564
02:23:41.10 --> 02:23:46.86
I wasn't I don't know if I wanted to see that part of it you know I mean like hey they check

2565
02:23:46.86 --> 02:23:49.98
at this ridiculous of own vulnerability that I have right now that I'm going to carry with me

2566
02:23:49.98 --> 02:23:53.66
for God that was how long that's going to come up I didn't know where and you're going to have

2567
02:23:53.66 --> 02:23:58.54
to just deal with it so there was a I think the thing that bothered me the most and was part of

2568
02:23:58.54 --> 02:24:03.74
just kind of getting back to day to day life was it I would get when things didn't go well when

2569
02:24:03.74 --> 02:24:09.18
I had my moments my irrational is just I just get pissed off it was that feeling of so you I have this

2570
02:24:09.18 --> 02:24:14.06
like some event would happen something stupid would catch my attention and kind of height my

2571
02:24:14.06 --> 02:24:19.90
you know my response and because it happened I'd be annoyed myself that I let it that I let it

2572
02:24:19.90 --> 02:24:24.46
bother me and then I'd be pissed off of myself because I let it bother me you know me like this ridiculous

2573
02:24:24.46 --> 02:24:29.98
cycle of I told you the story the other day my wife and I shoot I guarantee you she remembers

2574
02:24:29.98 --> 02:24:35.82
this tour we're walking across the street downtown no no by the beat I think and an auto body

2575
02:24:35.82 --> 02:24:40.38
shop is running the the air drill to pull some tires off I can root you know that kind of sound

2576
02:24:41.26 --> 02:24:47.10
and as we're walking I think my left arm is over her her shoulder we're walking like this

2577
02:24:47.10 --> 02:24:51.98
I hear that sound and my first reaction is I've pushed her down to the ground and in the time that it

2578
02:24:51.98 --> 02:24:58.62
takes to do that and catch that it's happening is maybe a third of a second you know what I mean

2579
02:24:58.62 --> 02:25:04.30
so I hear it I do the I'm I'm reacting and pushing her to the ground I'm kind of getting on top of

2580
02:25:04.30 --> 02:25:10.70
her to do look what up to oh that's the car it's not a thing there's no reason for you to do this

2581
02:25:10.70 --> 02:25:15.66
is about a third of a second and what bothered me the most about it is that I did it not that I

2582
02:25:15.66 --> 02:25:20.06
felt like that is it I reacted to it and I was like embarrassed like what's wrong with me to

2583
02:25:20.06 --> 02:25:26.22
to go through that and she's like what the you know and I it sounded like you know and kind

2584
02:25:26.22 --> 02:25:31.10
of going through the whole thing and I think just the the fact that I had responses pissed me off

2585
02:25:31.10 --> 02:25:36.06
and I would just kind of honestly I have a temper about it and that was she got to see me just

2586
02:25:36.06 --> 02:25:42.46
get pissed off itself for no real good reason which you never really get pissed off like I mean

2587
02:25:42.46 --> 02:25:47.26
I have tempered some pictures stuff that just I would get mad about stuff that just didn't make sense

2588
02:25:47.26 --> 02:25:52.62
I mean I have a temper about things that my computer pisses me off just like it pisses you off

2589
02:25:52.62 --> 02:25:57.82
man that's totally normal right I would get I would have reactions to stuff that just there was

2590
02:25:57.82 --> 02:26:02.30
no way for her to say oh that makes sense I understand it would just be this totally odd ball

2591
02:26:03.58 --> 02:26:07.74
somebody would say something wrong just it would just trigger in ways that she would look at me

2592
02:26:07.74 --> 02:26:12.30
and kind of be like who are you she knew all my flaws she knew everything right along with me and

2593
02:26:12.30 --> 02:26:17.18
all of a sudden now I'm doing all of those stuff for another little thing in the mix so I got my

2594
02:26:17.18 --> 02:26:21.98
wife who we get married I leave a go on this diploma and I come back I'm home for maybe seven

2595
02:26:21.98 --> 02:26:29.26
months before I deploy again in that seven months you know welcome to marriage to Dave Burke you

2596
02:26:29.26 --> 02:26:33.10
know that involves a year long deployment seven months and I rack you know

2597
02:26:33.10 --> 02:26:37.10
God oh knows what the hell I was you know I'm back to work so I'm back at a squadron as the

2598
02:26:37.10 --> 02:26:43.02
exo you know work in ridiculous exo hours in a fighter squadron prepping to go into deployment

2599
02:26:43.02 --> 02:26:49.98
I I voluntarily extend my time to make the deployment which is exactly what you should do at the

2600
02:26:49.98 --> 02:26:54.86
beginning of your marriage is volunteer to extend on a deployment I got accepted into grad school

2601
02:26:54.86 --> 02:26:59.02
I was going to go to Dartmouth I was getting out of the Marine Corps I was going to go to get my MBA

2602
02:26:59.02 --> 02:27:06.30
and I remember the conversation of hey I'm going to extend ask me to extend and you know

2603
02:27:06.30 --> 02:27:10.70
as explaining why I was going to do what I was going to do and she's like why why would you do that

2604
02:27:10.70 --> 02:27:17.82
and I said so I can deploy and you hear those words like god did I just say that to my wife like

2605
02:27:19.18 --> 02:27:24.06
which is so I cannot be with you so I can be apart from you so I can hang out the boys and go do that

2606
02:27:24.06 --> 02:27:28.06
you know I mean not retire from the ring you've got to know the Marine Corps so I can not do all these

2607
02:27:28.06 --> 02:27:32.06
other things that I'm not set up this future that I told you all about and so do you on totally

2608
02:27:32.70 --> 02:27:38.94
so to say that my wife and and everybody's got those stories the laundry list of reasons why she

2609
02:27:38.94 --> 02:27:43.98
should have just sort of cut bait and be like no this is not happening is a lot longer than

2610
02:27:43.98 --> 02:27:50.46
the list of reasons why she shouldn't have and props were good she's here and my marriage with her

2611
02:27:51.26 --> 02:27:55.18
you know for all the ups and downs it goes on get everybody's marriage the one thing I don't worry

2612
02:27:55.18 --> 02:28:01.02
about even even when we're at our worst at our absolute worst which our worst is whatever it is we have

2613
02:28:01.02 --> 02:28:06.62
our worst moments at our absolute worst I don't have a shred and have a brain cell of thought of

2614
02:28:06.62 --> 02:28:10.30
I wonder if our marriage is going to survive this you know this throat animal having over god knows

2615
02:28:10.30 --> 02:28:17.66
what you know so we hit kind of went through the fire there and she she got forged yeah big time

2616
02:28:17.66 --> 02:28:22.94
she's a stud she deserves mad props for going through that because I'm not really sure why she did

2617
02:28:22.94 --> 02:28:30.06
to be honest with you she said you know what I can't come up with a good reason to go she had a lot of

2618
02:28:30.06 --> 02:28:36.22
options on the table I'm not sure yeah so it was that transition was tough man you so now you're

2619
02:28:36.22 --> 02:28:40.22
in another squadron you go on to point me again which is another what what are you doing on that

2620
02:28:40.22 --> 02:28:44.78
deployment just more so I'm back in an F-18 squadron on the exo and the opposite I actually did

2621
02:28:44.78 --> 02:28:48.62
both jobs on this deployment we just go to Japan it's a Westtime okay Western Pacific we're back

2622
02:28:48.62 --> 02:28:54.78
in Iwakuni and and Ocanala just doing yeah exercise exercise training I kind of stuff

2623
02:28:54.78 --> 02:28:58.78
get done with that and so now maybe it's time to get out of the Marine Corps before I left

2624
02:28:58.78 --> 02:29:02.70
on that deployment I had told my commander the group commander and the squadron commander hey

2625
02:29:02.70 --> 02:29:07.10
this is it for me I'm hanging it up it's been awesome I happily to extend for this deployment

2626
02:29:07.10 --> 02:29:10.22
that they need to me to go on I was great experience I got to train a bunch of young guys

2627
02:29:10.94 --> 02:29:14.86
life was good but they knew before I left that I was going to be out of the Marine Corps

2628
02:29:14.86 --> 02:29:19.18
at the end of that I deferred at Dartmouth for a year paid my non-refundable deposit which I

2629
02:29:19.18 --> 02:29:23.74
have never gotten back it wasn't that's why they call it non-refundable right absolutely

2630
02:29:24.30 --> 02:29:29.10
there oh my point I wasn't kicking around the idea of getting out I was in full execution we had

2631
02:29:29.10 --> 02:29:34.38
looked at houses like we were in execution this was merely a detour to get to that end state

2632
02:29:35.58 --> 02:29:39.90
and what I'm doing back from that deployment in January I think it is of the following year

2633
02:29:39.90 --> 02:29:48.38
and it it turns out that the Marine Corps wants to send a guy to go fly F-22s for the

2634
02:29:48.38 --> 02:29:54.06
with the year force for three years and they're accepting applications for the F-22 Raptor

2635
02:29:54.06 --> 02:29:58.14
Exchange which had never been happened before never happened since there was a one time thing

2636
02:29:58.70 --> 02:30:04.70
and the guy got it they picked you know it was going to go to non-deploying in NLS and fly the F-22

2637
02:30:04.70 --> 02:30:11.42
Raptor should properly apply I guess it seems like a reasonable thing to do because if they say no then

2638
02:30:11.42 --> 02:30:18.54
yeah I'll just go to play I'll go get my MBA it's all good and Lone Behold at the end of December

2639
02:30:18.54 --> 02:30:25.50
I get the word that I got picked up for this Raptor Exchange and I remember calling it

2640
02:30:25.50 --> 02:30:36.62
in my head and I did the standard day work over sell hey no deploying we're going to go to you know

2641
02:30:36.62 --> 02:30:41.42
it's all there's all the goodness there's no downside you know and she's like shut up you know

2642
02:30:41.42 --> 02:30:46.86
she's and she was good with it you know it was it was it was just another one of those things like

2643
02:30:46.86 --> 02:30:50.94
I can't say no to this this is just something that doesn't happen and you just don't get to

2644
02:30:50.94 --> 02:30:55.74
nobody gets to fly the F-22 in the Marine Corps because the Marine Corps is a fly of 22

2645
02:30:55.74 --> 02:30:59.50
same thing I said when I flew F-16's in Top Gun and all this sort of stuff so it was just

2646
02:30:59.50 --> 02:31:04.62
another thing that I just couldn't believe was happening and I couldn't leave the Marine Corps

2647
02:31:04.62 --> 02:31:09.58
saying I walked away from that I just couldn't and she was totally unbored and okay moment

2648
02:31:10.38 --> 02:31:16.70
didn't get back my non-refundable deposit and uh move the Vegas and start to fly in the F-22 Raptor

2649
02:31:16.70 --> 02:31:22.62
three years up there and then at some point that roll this door oh yeah and that rolls into the F-35

2650
02:31:22.62 --> 02:31:28.94
at some point so I'm fine we're F-22's how many people were flying the F-22 at this point

2651
02:31:29.98 --> 02:31:35.82
so we probably had I knew at the time what number I was I think I might have been

2652
02:31:37.18 --> 02:31:43.26
in the 100 something you know we had two squadrons that were stood up you know and it was

2653
02:31:43.26 --> 02:31:47.50
starting to pick up the pace was early 2008 so the Raptor was just starting to get its legs

2654
02:31:47.50 --> 02:31:51.02
underneath it was starting to building more and it was starting to become a thing and the Marine

2655
02:31:51.02 --> 02:31:54.70
Corps had this idea that they're gonna they're gonna build this new stealth airplane called the F-35

2656
02:31:54.70 --> 02:31:59.58
and they're gonna get it and they wanted somebody to go to the Air Force to learn all the

2657
02:31:59.58 --> 02:32:03.82
airplanes are really similar there's a goal still all their experience and all the pain that they've

2658
02:32:03.82 --> 02:32:07.42
gone through to stand up this thing and then you're gonna bring it back to the Marine Corps so the

2659
02:32:07.42 --> 02:32:12.46
deal was this F-22 gig was it was really high probability I was gonna go right from the F-22 to the F-35

2660
02:32:12.46 --> 02:32:17.98
and command the first operational squadron and the lone-boiled man that's exactly what happened we

2661
02:32:17.98 --> 02:32:22.38
went to Tindall we lived in Tindall for three months when I went through training and

2662
02:32:23.18 --> 02:32:26.70
that was awesome we were living on the beach in Florida for three months it get trained in the

2663
02:32:26.70 --> 02:32:32.70
Raptor we moved out to Vegas lived there for three plus years started a family to my first two kids

2664
02:32:32.70 --> 02:32:38.38
were born in Las Vegas we were we're killing it man I mean it was awesome and as I'm getting

2665
02:32:38.38 --> 02:32:44.62
ready to leave Vegas I get selected to command the first operational there was a guy there before

2666
02:32:44.62 --> 02:32:48.86
they didn't have airplanes they had a guy there was another seal before me but I was gonna go out

2667
02:32:48.86 --> 02:32:53.26
there and accept and start flying the first F-35's the Marine Corps I show up and this poor guy

2668
02:32:53.26 --> 02:32:58.54
was selected to do the same thing the two years prior great dude but you know we'd stayed in touch

2669
02:32:58.54 --> 02:33:03.10
and we were always in contact and helping them stand up with everything and and I get there

2670
02:33:03.10 --> 02:33:08.62
Jacob I'm there I think two days and the first airplane showed up and I'm like what's the

2671
02:33:09.58 --> 02:33:14.54
what's the big deal he spent two years in CSing airplane working I'm there all this paper work

2672
02:33:14.54 --> 02:33:18.38
grinding doing all this has been a straight stuff to prep he gets nowhere plans use you up two days

2673
02:33:18.38 --> 02:33:22.46
that are boom did the amount of work that him and his guys went through to stand up the squadron

2674
02:33:22.46 --> 02:33:27.58
I literally showed up at the work in the next day the first airplane landed yeah that's my new

2675
02:33:27.58 --> 02:33:33.42
nickname for you like this really isn't that hard man what's the big deal and and he and I did a turn

2676
02:33:33.42 --> 02:33:41.02
over and he left and sort of flying up 35's and you know that's a whole part of my career we

2677
02:33:41.02 --> 02:33:46.06
could spend hours on that but I flew the rapture which was an amazing airplane and I flew the

2678
02:33:46.06 --> 02:33:53.18
35 which was an amazing airplane and I got to totally be relevant in aviation I had sort of exhausted

2679
02:33:53.98 --> 02:33:57.02
I did all the things I wanted to do in the Hornet I loved that airplane I did top

2680
02:33:57.02 --> 02:34:01.90
and I kind of had reached all the things and we talked about this too when when you leave top gun

2681
02:34:03.10 --> 02:34:08.62
you're never going to be that good ever again so it's just a matter of how slow you can make the

2682
02:34:08.62 --> 02:34:14.14
process of getting worse it's just how can you slow it down to be as good as you can knowing

2683
02:34:14.14 --> 02:34:17.90
that you will never be as good as you were there because you're just you're never going to get the

2684
02:34:17.90 --> 02:34:22.86
reps again ever you're just never going to get it and so it's just a matter of kind of slowing

2685
02:34:22.86 --> 02:34:27.02
down that process and at some point in your mind like I don't want to be in this business if I'm not

2686
02:34:27.02 --> 02:34:34.54
at the top of my game when I flew the I have 22 I didn't have a job I didn't I wasn't I wasn't the

2687
02:34:34.54 --> 02:34:37.42
absolute of a squadron which is what I just showed up in the food place I just showed up in

2688
02:34:37.42 --> 02:34:41.50
food the plan I had some leadership responsibility in in the organization so grab the keys from

2689
02:34:41.50 --> 02:34:46.30
someone take it out of spin yeah run into the ground right a little report and be like bring

2690
02:34:46.30 --> 02:34:50.78
a back and get the keys back to the maintenance guys and yeah hey this thing is broken give me another one

2691
02:34:50.78 --> 02:34:58.78
it was it was awesome yeah so I did that totally great for for my marriage my I was able to

2692
02:34:58.78 --> 02:35:03.26
combine all these professional interests with great which you don't get to do in the Marine Corps

2693
02:35:03.26 --> 02:35:08.94
when there's a war going on you just don't get to do that and here I am and do I had no more friends

2694
02:35:08.94 --> 02:35:13.50
in the Marine Corps man nobody liked me they're all doing back to back to back to Poem

2695
02:35:13.50 --> 02:35:18.86
it's an airplanes are breaking and I'm living in Vegas flying the raptor all my bros were like

2696
02:35:18.86 --> 02:35:23.74
we're done with you man we got nothing for you so you know I was just I was felt guilty I

2697
02:35:23.74 --> 02:35:29.42
did not feel guilty but I almost did yeah almost did and then I go out we moved to

2698
02:35:29.42 --> 02:35:33.58
Destin Florida you know or or Fort Altman Beach and we lived in Niceville and this awesome house

2699
02:35:33.58 --> 02:35:38.78
in this great community and I was the first pilot to ever fly the 35th be operationally in the

2700
02:35:38.78 --> 02:35:45.82
world ridiculous did that probably two and a half years and it was awesome and then you what brought

2701
02:35:45.82 --> 02:35:52.70
you up to DC so what brought me up to DC so I was I was so sure that I was going to leave the

2702
02:35:52.70 --> 02:35:56.94
Marine Corps after that command tour they have 35 that I reapplyed a Dartmouth got back in again

2703
02:35:57.50 --> 02:36:03.34
got accepted to do you have to give another deposit no I was I was smart enough not to pay the deposit

2704
02:36:03.34 --> 02:36:06.94
because there's a tiny little possibility that was going to work out anyway I did get into Dartmouth

2705
02:36:06.94 --> 02:36:13.98
again and it's like babe I'm going to go to get my MBA I was wanted to get my MBA and I got selected

2706
02:36:13.98 --> 02:36:19.98
for an academic fellowship where I basically got to go to grad school for a year I went to

2707
02:36:19.98 --> 02:36:25.66
say the semi-dejons Hopkins University to give my masters and I basically went to DC it was a

2708
02:36:25.66 --> 02:36:31.50
civilian for a year and between those two things is another terrible deal like the Marine

2709
02:36:31.50 --> 02:36:36.14
Corps like to pay you to go be a full-time student at Johns Hopkins which which they did

2710
02:36:37.34 --> 02:36:42.22
so we moved up to DC and I went to Johns Hopkins to get my masters and then the next thing

2711
02:36:42.22 --> 02:36:49.58
they offered you is to go back and yeah so from there the the payback of that good deal was

2712
02:36:49.58 --> 02:36:54.22
to go to the Pentagon which was totally reasonable thing I'd post command I'd been to school

2713
02:36:54.22 --> 02:36:58.78
I mean it certainly couldn't complain about how tough my life was in the Marine Corps since

2714
02:36:58.78 --> 02:37:03.66
you know the last eight years or whatever it was and I just went basically did a desk job in the

2715
02:37:03.66 --> 02:37:08.46
Pentagon and I worked for and the joint staff and the chairman joined Chiefs of Staff just working

2716
02:37:08.46 --> 02:37:11.90
some project it wasn't all that exciting it was I learned a bunch but it was just kind of a

2717
02:37:12.62 --> 02:37:17.98
kind of a med job I was you know very nine to five strict hours don't take work on we know black

2718
02:37:17.98 --> 02:37:26.30
Barry no real responsibility pretty chill life life was pretty good I selected I picked up Colonel while I was there

2719
02:37:27.66 --> 02:37:34.62
the end of 2015 I was selected for Colonel and in the summer of 2016 I selected for a command

2720
02:37:34.62 --> 02:37:44.06
again as a Colonel this time to command and have 35 squadron but I didn't want to do that

2721
02:37:44.94 --> 02:37:48.30
I don't know how this is going to come across so the people listening and what a terrible deal

2722
02:37:48.30 --> 02:37:52.94
was the Marine Corps asked if it would be a Colonel and go fly up 35 again and I'm not I'm not

2723
02:37:53.58 --> 02:37:59.26
I don't want this to come across that I was complaining but what I the one thing that I

2724
02:37:59.26 --> 02:38:04.70
in all those great deals and dude they were great deals the thing that I was missing the most

2725
02:38:05.58 --> 02:38:10.54
was that I always kind of felt like I had one foot in a one foot out they were these non-deploying jobs the Air Force

2726
02:38:10.54 --> 02:38:19.26
exchange the the F 35 job was kind of standing up a squadron we weren't prepping for anything and I

2727
02:38:19.26 --> 02:38:29.10
loved it but I could feel sort of underneath the surface I got a lack of investment I could tell I

2728
02:38:29.10 --> 02:38:34.78
just wasn't I didn't have to be 100 set pot committed because there was no we're going to go to

2729
02:38:34.78 --> 02:38:39.02
deploy or we're going to go to there was no thing that was going to happen and I think one of the

2730
02:38:39.02 --> 02:38:42.94
healthiest things about being in the Marine Corps is always prepping for something so even the

2731
02:38:42.94 --> 02:38:46.78
crappy stuff you don't want to do you know hey we got to do this because the end state is this

2732
02:38:47.74 --> 02:38:52.62
and I was missing that and it sort of over time started to erode a little bit that I did I was

2733
02:38:52.62 --> 02:38:59.98
catching myself on a little slack in the line to be honest with you I to be really blunt I didn't

2734
02:38:59.98 --> 02:39:03.82
have to bring my a game every day I just didn't I could do the things that I was doing certainly

2735
02:39:03.82 --> 02:39:08.70
in airplane because there was just an element that there was no outcome to what I was preparing for

2736
02:39:09.42 --> 02:39:14.94
and I started to kind of find other interests like school became really interesting to me I did that

2737
02:39:14.94 --> 02:39:19.74
year and so I continued my education jobs options and started working towards my MBA because I needed

2738
02:39:19.74 --> 02:39:26.14
something or wanted something else and once you kind of catch in your mind that the Marine Corps

2739
02:39:26.14 --> 02:39:29.50
and what they're asking you to do I was going to go back to a training squadron I wanted to go to

2740
02:39:29.50 --> 02:39:33.34
be an operational commander with operational units that are preparing to go something I wasn't

2741
02:39:33.34 --> 02:39:37.58
going to get to do that I was going to go back to a training environment I caught myself

2742
02:39:39.74 --> 02:39:44.78
losing the thing that was the most passionate about the Marine Corps and seeing it's more of like

2743
02:39:44.78 --> 02:39:48.14
okay three years here this will get me to this retirement and this amount of money and it was just

2744
02:39:48.14 --> 02:39:54.22
starting to become a little too professional and not enough a passion and I don't mean to say I was

2745
02:39:54.22 --> 02:39:59.02
going to need to feel like a 21 year old again I you don't need to recreate it like that but my

2746
02:39:59.02 --> 02:40:03.90
life actually sat me down with her talking and she just kind of looked at me as like dude you're

2747
02:40:03.90 --> 02:40:08.06
not going to be happy doing this it was really clear to her I think even more clear than it was

2748
02:40:08.06 --> 02:40:17.42
for me it's hard to come across as ungrateful but I I could I was not going to be good at that job

2749
02:40:17.42 --> 02:40:21.26
because there was something that was missing it was something that I didn't there was nothing

2750
02:40:21.26 --> 02:40:28.30
that I about it that it made me feel passionate about doing it so no joke man last year August I

2751
02:40:29.74 --> 02:40:33.74
basically told that I declined command I declined promotion and I put it for her time and all the same

2752
02:40:33.74 --> 02:40:41.82
day and that was a big move man the big move that created a little splash out there in the world

2753
02:40:41.82 --> 02:40:49.82
yeah maybe it was it didn't it surprised everybody but my wife obviously she was totally

2754
02:40:49.82 --> 02:40:52.70
got it and I knew it was the right thing in my closest buddy so I mean I talked to my

2755
02:40:52.70 --> 02:40:57.98
bros my tight my bros those guys understood but yeah it was a big move and I was turning

2756
02:40:57.98 --> 02:41:03.50
down what by a whole right by all rights was a really good great deal another great deal down

2757
02:41:03.50 --> 02:41:12.54
about it and then at some point you show up at a different kind of event in Virginia with

2758
02:41:12.54 --> 02:41:19.66
Lafen Eye working with a company for our company Ashland front we're doing a leadership training

2759
02:41:19.66 --> 02:41:25.26
for a company and you decided to come down and check it out Lafen said come on down check this out

2760
02:41:25.26 --> 02:41:31.58
see what you think of this yeah so Lafen talked to me a couple years ago when I was leaving

2761
02:41:31.58 --> 02:41:36.86
that F-35 job before I went up to DC and he's like hey man joc on our doing this thing it's going to be

2762
02:41:36.86 --> 02:41:42.86
awesome um we'd love to you know talk about it and I'm like hey man I'm I'm I'm all in this other

2763
02:41:42.86 --> 02:41:48.14
gig I'm going to school I'm going to the Marine Corps we in state and touch I mean Lafen's

2764
02:41:48.14 --> 02:41:51.82
buddy I mean is a guy that that I appreciate it you know the times that we reconnected here and

2765
02:41:51.82 --> 02:41:55.90
there and I certainly appreciate it the call but it just really wasn't in the calculator and I wasn't

2766
02:41:55.90 --> 02:42:02.38
really I wasn't there so I when I told him like hey man I dropped my letter I'm getting out

2767
02:42:04.38 --> 02:42:08.14
and like I said Lafen isn't always the easiest guy to get a hold of right away to talk sometimes

2768
02:42:08.14 --> 02:42:13.02
he's he's got a lot on his place a busy guy and he texted me back right then I'm on the bus

2769
02:42:13.02 --> 02:42:19.02
leaving the Pentagon is I hid you up time to talk right now so he calls me and we talk for I mean

2770
02:42:19.02 --> 02:42:24.70
probably a solid 45 minutes to an hour and he's like hey joc on our going to be up in Vienna here

2771
02:42:24.70 --> 02:42:31.42
in a couple weeks once you come out for the day I'm like okay right on and he gave me you know

2772
02:42:31.42 --> 02:42:35.66
I like I was following you guys I knew it was going on I was seeing what you're doing things were blowing up

2773
02:42:35.66 --> 02:42:39.42
I was something bragging on my buddy's life in jocot anybody there was listening to me about it

2774
02:42:40.86 --> 02:42:46.46
and I watched you know you and Lafen give this presentation up there in Vienna to this group and

2775
02:42:48.94 --> 02:42:50.46
dude

2776
02:42:50.46 --> 02:42:57.02
you were it was awesome man you were the smile on your face we you know we got done and

2777
02:42:57.02 --> 02:43:04.70
that first day and we sat down with you you were in big time like I am in I want to do this

2778
02:43:04.70 --> 02:43:09.98
this is all you were pumped and yeah and I think that was you know and then and then actually

2779
02:43:09.98 --> 02:43:16.22
we did I brought you up and we did an event with another company yeah and that you're now involved

2780
02:43:16.22 --> 02:43:22.54
with for a long term and and even then you know because then for us you know I wanted to see what

2781
02:43:22.54 --> 02:43:27.34
you were going to do and see how you were going to do it and man I was like I don't know you gave

2782
02:43:27.34 --> 02:43:32.94
your first two paragraphs of talking you know your first two minutes of of explaining something

2783
02:43:32.94 --> 02:43:39.50
I was like okay cool I'm good and I was you know just everything that we talk about all the time

2784
02:43:39.50 --> 02:43:46.06
you know that's in the book and hearing you describe things from the book but with your view on

2785
02:43:46.06 --> 02:43:52.86
it and your angle and it's it's refreshing to me and also I'm just I'm even learning right so

2786
02:43:52.86 --> 02:43:57.02
I'm here in a different angle and like I talk about with with everything it was like we just talked

2787
02:43:57.02 --> 02:44:01.58
about with with flying at top gun or like it isn't your jitter or like it isn't the battlefield

2788
02:44:01.58 --> 02:44:05.10
the more different angles you can see something from the better you're going to get at it and so

2789
02:44:05.10 --> 02:44:10.62
here I am listening to you going oh there's another angle yep here we go so that was awesome and it was

2790
02:44:10.62 --> 02:44:16.30
also the first time you know with J.P. same thing you know I I listened to J. but it's like the

2791
02:44:16.30 --> 02:44:19.90
first time J.P. you came with me and he was just sitting in the back like what you did the first time

2792
02:44:19.90 --> 02:44:24.38
he was sitting in the back and and I say man come come on you know when when I do this Q&A answer some

2793
02:44:24.38 --> 02:44:29.66
questions and you know I'm thinking hey if something goes sideways I'll just be able to cover for

2794
02:44:29.66 --> 02:44:34.06
him no big deal you know somebody asked a question and J.P. kind of gives me a look like hey

2795
02:44:34.06 --> 02:44:38.62
well I'll answer this and I was like okay you know go ahead I'll just cover for you just

2796
02:44:38.62 --> 02:44:43.18
just give us an awesome answer I'm like okay I'll sit down now and it's the same thing with you I was

2797
02:44:43.18 --> 02:44:47.02
like you know you're thinking okay where's he gonna go with this with this is a tough question or

2798
02:44:47.02 --> 02:44:53.02
whatever and boom here you go you know fire for a fact and both those two events happened really close

2799
02:44:53.02 --> 02:45:00.22
together for me and for for me it was and I call actually called life I think it was the next day

2800
02:45:00.22 --> 02:45:06.70
or is I might have been that evening and I said hey life you know we're good to go like we are not

2801
02:45:06.70 --> 02:45:13.90
gonna have to do all of this ourselves because Dave and J.P. can do this they get it they can they

2802
02:45:13.90 --> 02:45:19.02
can do it and which was you know everybody in their own I don't want to think it's arrogance

2803
02:45:19.02 --> 02:45:25.02
but it's it's just you don't see it and so you kind of think how is any you know it's like when

2804
02:45:25.02 --> 02:45:27.90
you're in command of something that's one of the really hard things to do is let go you know and

2805
02:45:27.90 --> 02:45:32.54
and life's talked about this all the time you know when I'd be watching him roll out on out the gate

2806
02:45:32.54 --> 02:45:37.26
for his first mission I done all kinds of missions like that and here he's going out of his first one

2807
02:45:37.26 --> 02:45:41.10
that he's in charge of and you're thinking man I should just go I want to go and I want to go and

2808
02:45:41.10 --> 02:45:45.58
and then you know two hours it comes back and you're like high five you and then you go cool I

2809
02:45:45.58 --> 02:45:50.30
don't have to be the guy that goes every time and so when when I saw you when I saw J.P. you know it's like

2810
02:45:50.30 --> 02:45:56.86
this is awesome and I called life and said we are gonna be good to go other guys they can do this

2811
02:45:56.86 --> 02:46:00.86
they can bring the same message they can bring the same passion and power and knowledge and that was

2812
02:46:00.86 --> 02:46:08.14
very very you know refreshing to me and bottom line is the experiences are the same I mean they're

2813
02:46:08.14 --> 02:46:13.82
not exactly the same but the the experience and the body is the same and then the experience that we

2814
02:46:13.82 --> 02:46:18.46
had throughout our military career and now you get to see what it's like interacting with businesses

2815
02:46:18.46 --> 02:46:23.98
and you see all those similarities so that was a that was a big day and so in case I haven't made this

2816
02:46:23.98 --> 02:46:32.54
clear yet Dave now is with us part of the echelon front team and doing what we do helping businesses

2817
02:46:32.54 --> 02:46:37.82
with their leadership in their companies so it's awesome it's awesome having you on

2818
02:46:39.10 --> 02:46:43.02
it's huge for me I told you I love you know I love the Marine Corps I'm they're something missing

2819
02:46:43.02 --> 02:46:46.62
and I can't I can't stay in Marine because there's something missing well you leave the Marine Corps

2820
02:46:46.62 --> 02:46:53.18
like how in the hell am I gonna recreate that thing that I'm looking for not in the military it's

2821
02:46:53.18 --> 02:46:59.90
all I know is that's the place and that was my biggest my biggest fear was I'm not gonna go like

2822
02:46:59.90 --> 02:47:07.66
go to work you know go do something that I so I was worried like I got to find something and

2823
02:47:07.66 --> 02:47:11.58
that's part of the reason why that first gig with you guys in the back was like holy cow man

2824
02:47:11.58 --> 02:47:17.02
you you've got to be kidding me it's all those things you just discussed all those things I spent

2825
02:47:17.02 --> 02:47:23.58
on a whole life living and breathing and learning and and and then it's with people like

2826
02:47:23.58 --> 02:47:29.10
late in jocco from where my work we're gonna do this together yeah so good deal Dave

2827
02:47:30.38 --> 02:47:37.18
you kidding me yeah dude I wasn't on monster dot com searching for employment opportunities

2828
02:47:37.18 --> 02:47:42.38
late call me he's at come to Vienna my dad okay my head was a million miles away man

2829
02:47:42.38 --> 02:47:46.54
I'm just working through paperwork to drop my letter out to leave the Marine Corps like very

2830
02:47:46.54 --> 02:47:52.54
hastily with no no plan B there was no I'm leaving to do this you can ask when you like there was

2831
02:47:52.54 --> 02:47:59.50
zero conversation about what I'm gonna do and I came back from them like obviously here's the plan

2832
02:48:00.78 --> 02:48:07.10
and dude he was instantaneous for me it was instantaneous and then to be able to share that

2833
02:48:07.10 --> 02:48:12.62
message and believe it and have all those feelings and in a totally different way and to work with you

2834
02:48:12.62 --> 02:48:19.66
guys yeah and it's cool too because you get that kind of for you top gun for me working in the training

2835
02:48:19.66 --> 02:48:25.26
command where it's like like what I already talked about you you have this experience and when I

2836
02:48:25.26 --> 02:48:28.30
was getting out I'm saying what am I gonna do with this thing what am I gonna do that I got all this

2837
02:48:28.30 --> 02:48:32.54
knowledge and I thought okay well I guess I'll put it in a cruise box over here lock it up and it'll

2838
02:48:32.54 --> 02:48:39.10
you know it'll fade away and turn in dust but when you realize that you can take what you learned

2839
02:48:39.10 --> 02:48:45.58
and you can apply it to all these you know civilian civilians and civilian companies it's it's

2840
02:48:45.58 --> 02:48:51.90
pretty it's a pretty damn good feeling to have and to be able to go go out and do it on a regular basis

2841
02:48:51.90 --> 02:48:58.14
and one of the best things about it is you get to see the improvement you get to see teams and again

2842
02:49:00.22 --> 02:49:04.14
it's kind of like when you show up and you see the leadership issues you're having it's like

2843
02:49:04.14 --> 02:49:09.50
you're seeing you know what the future is you know how to fix it and you just go this is going to be fun

2844
02:49:09.50 --> 02:49:14.06
and you get to see these people grow and learn and improve and get better and if they're already good

2845
02:49:14.06 --> 02:49:17.34
you get to see them become awesome if they're not doing great you get to see them improve their

2846
02:49:17.34 --> 02:49:22.38
position and then moving that direction so it's definitely rewarding from that aspect I know you've

2847
02:49:22.38 --> 02:49:26.70
already seen that yeah without it out and you know that book and the lessons and you talked to

2848
02:49:26.70 --> 02:49:32.46
you know the title of the book is how US Navy SEALS LEADN WIN you know I'm top my life is what I learned

2849
02:49:32.46 --> 02:49:39.18
from from top gun in the Marine Corps it just so happens like we said it's exactly the same I have my

2850
02:49:39.18 --> 02:49:44.78
own long list of my personal experiences with those things but I was telling you the day like the

2851
02:49:44.78 --> 02:49:50.94
concepts it's identical and so there's no like big leap in my mind how am I going to get there from

2852
02:49:50.94 --> 02:49:55.26
how am I going to embrace this it's oh yeah oh my god that's exactly what I've been doing for the

2853
02:49:55.26 --> 02:50:00.86

maybe you could present us at this time with some information on sure if anybody does want to

2882
02:53:08.06 --> 02:53:12.70
support this podcast how they could do it yeah small presentation yeah small presentation who is

2883
02:53:12.70 --> 02:53:16.70
that with the green M&M's that thing he said with the green that was somebody right

2884
02:53:16.70 --> 02:53:20.06
somebody be rough it's David Lee Roth and I actually know the story behind this

2885
02:53:21.18 --> 02:53:26.78
there's a reason why he did that they would have a it's called a I forget what it's called

2886
02:53:26.78 --> 02:53:31.34
but when you go to somewhere oh it's called a writer right so you get a contract and the

2887
02:53:31.34 --> 02:53:36.06
contract comes with a writer and says this is the things that we need so what David Lee Roth from

2888
02:53:36.06 --> 02:53:44.86
Van Hayle would do is he would say hey I want you know seven bowls of M&M's with no brown M&M's

2889
02:53:44.86 --> 02:53:51.02
in them or green or whatever I think it was brown but he said no brown M&M's and this sounds

2890
02:53:51.02 --> 02:53:55.58
like a ridiculous request right I mean who would possibly want that blah blah blah blah well

2891
02:53:55.58 --> 02:54:00.54
David Lee Roth did it for reason why do you think he did it can you guess no can you guess

2892
02:54:01.26 --> 02:54:05.18
because check it out think of how simple this is he's doing a concert one night he's doing a

2893
02:54:05.18 --> 02:54:09.26
concert two light later to concert three nights after that so he's on the road hitting these

2894
02:54:09.26 --> 02:54:12.22
concert venues and there's all this stuff that has to be set up and all the stuff that

2895
02:54:12.22 --> 02:54:17.66
lights and sound and sound boards and special effects and ramps and all this stuff's got to be

2896
02:54:17.66 --> 02:54:25.02
set up and it's got to be set up right when he would show up if the seven bowls of M&M's were

2897
02:54:25.02 --> 02:54:29.34
laid out and there's no brown M&M's in him he wouldn't have to go and inspect everything because

2898
02:54:29.34 --> 02:54:36.06
he knew that they were paying attention and if he got there and it wasn't that way he knew

2899
02:54:36.06 --> 02:54:40.78
that these people had an issue with attention detail and so now he had to be go and scrutinize

2900
02:54:40.78 --> 02:54:44.54
and make sure everything wasn't placed the way it was supposed to be. Little lesson learned from

2901
02:54:44.54 --> 02:54:47.50
Bayvenley Roth. This was like a little test. Yeah really. Yeah really.

2902
02:54:47.50 --> 02:54:54.46
Yeah really. A little test M&M's test. Interesting. And by the way that story that I just told

2903
02:54:54.46 --> 02:55:02.46
that may be a hundred percent urban myth but I I know I heard it somebody. I thought I think it's true.

2904
02:55:02.46 --> 02:55:07.02
I'm sure somebody I'm sure our listeners will tell us where that can be referenced. Yeah for some

2905
02:55:07.02 --> 02:55:11.42
reason I thought I thought I thought of somebody else and that's just how they were. Where they're OCD or

2906
02:55:11.42 --> 02:55:20.94
something. I don't know either way. Hey you're so you think about like the reason you were such

2907
02:55:20.94 --> 02:55:28.30
an important asset given your skill set as a forward air control. That's what's called is

2908
02:55:28.30 --> 02:55:33.42
because essentially you have all this expertise while you're in the air and you can bring all that

2909
02:55:33.42 --> 02:55:39.50
brain in eyes to the ground. Yeah that's why you're better than your, yeah. I mean in a

2910
02:55:39.50 --> 02:55:44.70
yes. Absolutely. I didn't really pick up on that till kind of later. I was like dang that's pretty

2911
02:55:44.70 --> 02:55:51.90
advanced. If you think about any aspect I mean it's like if you that's why in the corner of a

2912
02:55:51.90 --> 02:55:58.14
mixed martial arts match oftentimes they'll be a striking coach. They'll be a due to due to coach

2913
02:55:58.14 --> 02:56:02.22
and they'll be a wrestling coach. You know they'll have those specific guys in there and sometimes they'll

2914
02:56:02.22 --> 02:56:08.86
bring a specific guy in to corner like like Dean. Dean has been brought in to corner guys

2915
02:56:08.86 --> 02:56:12.54
that are going against a specific due to two person because they want to get a little

2916
02:56:12.54 --> 02:56:20.86
of that expertise. Same fundamental concept here. Hey when we start with this podcast I need

2917
02:56:20.86 --> 02:56:29.02
it somebody that knew how to press record. Boom. See same thing identical. Yeah. I did it all those

2918
02:56:29.02 --> 02:56:35.26
years of pressing record and then stop and then record again. Yeah. So I'm kind of like good deal echo

2919
02:56:35.26 --> 02:56:40.38
in a way. Yeah. Same thing. Doing the same thing is Dave really. When it comes down to it

2920
02:56:40.38 --> 02:56:51.10
speaking of doing good things. So that was a big like breath like you better say something.

2921
02:56:51.10 --> 02:56:56.54
I'm gonna say a lot. Actually I'm not gonna say a lot actually. Yeah. You know last one I felt like

2922
02:56:56.54 --> 02:57:02.62
I really went deep into the krill oil analogy the night club Omega 3's. Oh tell me that. Yeah.

2923
02:57:02.62 --> 02:57:09.18
You know love of God. I feel like the mess. That was a good analogy. That was a perfect analogy.

2924
02:57:09.18 --> 02:57:14.22
That was excellent. In fact it was so good I wouldn't touch it. That's what I'm saying. You know that

2925
02:57:14.22 --> 02:57:18.38
you can do this too much of a good thing. Anyway if you get a no acrylic oil is it's a little like

2926
02:57:18.38 --> 02:57:25.02
what shrimp things. Baby shrimp. You extract the oil and it's getting good for your joints. The

2927
02:57:25.02 --> 02:57:29.34
Omega 3's and that. The good for your joints. Anyway, in regards to supplementation which

2928
02:57:30.14 --> 02:57:36.70
I'm down for now by the way. I'm a supplement person. Not all supplements. Just the key ones.

2929
02:57:36.70 --> 02:57:43.02
Doing maintenance whatnot. Anyway, getting from on it that's the best ones. Everyone knows that factually.

2930
02:57:43.02 --> 02:57:49.50
So if you want a 10% discount on that go to on it.com slash.com.

2931
02:57:50.54 --> 02:57:56.06
I want to talk about the sodium in the water situation. I got to feel that we're just gonna hear it over here.

2932
02:57:56.06 --> 02:58:03.34
Yeah. So. So while they even I are talking through the podcast are you just over here just

2933
02:58:03.34 --> 02:58:09.10
dreaming up just somewhere you're going with that. When you say echo how can you support? I'm thinking

2934
02:58:10.30 --> 02:58:15.82
dang you days been controlling all this stuff and going to talk to you been doing your stuff and

2935
02:58:15.82 --> 02:58:20.62
I'm watching like sodium in the lake videos. You ever watch those? You're doing what you have to.

2936
02:58:20.62 --> 02:58:22.14
Doing what I'm doing. Yeah. So.

2937
02:58:26.86 --> 02:58:31.82
Anyway, the more I watch those the better analogy I realize it is. You know with the Amazon

2938
02:58:31.82 --> 02:58:36.78
click through things so people want to support the spotcast in an easy way. Click through the website

2939
02:58:36.78 --> 02:58:41.42
jockelpodcast.com. There's a little support tab. Click on it. Do your Amazon shopping.

2940
02:58:42.30 --> 02:58:48.94
Some people are smart when they do this. They cleverly figured up which I mean I think I mentioned

2941
02:58:48.94 --> 02:58:53.82
or I know I mentioned it long time ago but what they do is they click on it and they save that

2942
02:58:53.82 --> 02:58:59.42
URL into their bookmarks. Some people are smart like that. Yeah. Like you just says Amazon.

2943
02:58:59.42 --> 02:59:05.42
So on the right on my bookmarks, Martin just says Amazon and that's what I did. Right. Not even smart.

2944
02:59:05.42 --> 02:59:11.74
I did that. Yeah. Amen. That's a smart thing to do. Good way to support. Yeah. Good way to support.

2945
02:59:11.74 --> 02:59:17.26
Before you do your Amazon shopping, click through there and you know that's a really solid

2946
02:59:17.26 --> 02:59:22.22
solid way to support. Small action with the click through. Big reaction, big support.

2947
02:59:23.10 --> 02:59:28.86

03:00:18.94 --> 03:00:25.66
whatever. Yeah. It's in the team hours long. Yeah. Can do it. It's not too realistic. Also,

2958
03:00:25.66 --> 03:00:30.86
Jocquoise a store. It's called Jocquoise store. We got a new design. That's all I'm going to say about it.

2961
03:00:42.30 --> 03:00:50.94
Dang. This was kind of like a bullshit crowd get after it. Yeah. Yeah. This is like a crowd.

2962
03:00:51.90 --> 03:00:58.54
I wouldn't consider it crowdsourced idea, but, you know, how crowd demanded. Yeah, you know, I was like,

2963
03:00:58.54 --> 03:01:02.78
hey, that you put this on the shirt, put this on the shirt, make sense, make sense. So we're kind of extrapolated

2964
03:01:02.78 --> 03:01:09.10
all the ideas that I thought were good. Master more of the ideas that I heard from you. You thought were good.

2965
03:01:09.10 --> 03:01:16.78
And boom, there it is. New design. Currently legit. Yeah. Jocquoise store.com. Anyway,

2966
03:01:17.82 --> 03:01:26.86
some cool stuff. Good for, uh, there's stuff for women and rash cards. There's stuff for rash

2967
03:01:26.86 --> 03:01:32.14
cards. No. Hey, that was the interruption of thought. But so like rash cards. We have to

2968
03:01:32.14 --> 03:01:37.10
do some more for Brady after this one. Yeah, no, it's okay. Good. You know how you think of like

2969
03:01:37.10 --> 03:01:41.26
five things at once and they're all like jocking to see which ones are going to come to the next.

2970
03:01:41.26 --> 03:01:46.86
Yeah, that's what happened right there. The rash, the rash card thought came in in one.

2971
03:01:46.86 --> 03:01:52.22
Anyway, I think I'm going to put a new rash card one design out as well. But anyway,

2972
03:01:52.22 --> 03:01:59.82
rash cards, if you want 19% improvement in performance. All aspects of performance. All. Yeah.

2973
03:01:59.82 --> 03:02:06.62
That's mental physical emotional as well. Double blind tested, by the way. Yeah. I think like

2974
03:02:06.62 --> 03:02:12.30
quadruple blind. Yeah. And not blind tested. All that stuff. Psychological warfare. If you're

2975
03:02:12.30 --> 03:02:19.90
having weakness in maintaining unmitigated daily discipline in all things,

2976
03:02:22.70 --> 03:02:28.30
listen to psychological warfare. Yeah. I got, I just got interviewed the other day and it was a,

2977
03:02:28.30 --> 03:02:33.18
the guy, you know, he sent me a blue question, you know, hey, what do you do when you're in a

2978
03:02:33.18 --> 03:02:38.70
situation where you've got, you know, you want to go to the gym or you're, you're supposed to do

2979
03:02:38.70 --> 03:02:43.26
some hard task for workers to some, trying to do something to improve yourself and you, you know,

2980
03:02:43.26 --> 03:02:48.14
the, the mindset comes in where you just, you just don't want to do it. You know, what should

2981
03:02:48.14 --> 03:02:56.38
you think people should do then? Yeah. And I said, do it anyway. Right. And then it was all quiet.

2982
03:02:56.38 --> 03:03:00.78
Because he thinks I'm going to give this big explanation. But there's no big explanation. Yeah.

2983
03:03:00.78 --> 03:03:06.46
The explanation is, oh, the stuff is hard. Yeah. I can't make that thing easier for you. I cannot

2984
03:03:06.46 --> 03:03:12.46
make 20 reps squats any easier for you. I can't do it. They're going to be hard. In fact,

2985
03:03:12.46 --> 03:03:16.30
they're going to suck. And I can't make nothing. I can do is going to make it easier for you.

2986
03:03:16.30 --> 03:03:23.58
You know what you have to do to do it anyways. It's kind of like, I told this to Jade that exact

2987
03:03:23.58 --> 03:03:29.42
situation or that thing that you just said where it's, even if you don't feel like doing it,

2988
03:03:29.42 --> 03:03:33.50
you still want to do it and all this stuff. But your body is like, oh, it's kind of running on

2989
03:03:33.50 --> 03:03:39.50
auto. Like, okay, compare it to like a video camera, right? Where you put the settings on auto and it'll

2990
03:03:39.50 --> 03:03:43.82
it'll adjust with how it's feeling. And that's how it's going to handle any situation. The

2991
03:03:43.82 --> 03:03:49.26
light kind of goes down. It kind of adjusts how it feels, you know, that to deal with this situation.

2992
03:03:49.26 --> 03:03:54.70
So if you're running on auto and you don't feel like dealing head on with this workout, these squats

2993
03:03:54.70 --> 03:03:58.54
you're going to maneuver around it. Just kind of automatically, no, you got to turn it to manual

2994
03:03:58.54 --> 03:04:02.30
manual. You'll be like, I don't care if they're hard squats, easy squats, how what I feel.

2995
03:04:02.30 --> 03:04:06.54
I'm going to do them. This is what we're doing. Yes, exactly. So it's like a manual control.

2996
03:04:06.54 --> 03:04:09.90
Yeah. Just control your own mind. Yes. You've talked about that before. Don't do it on like the

2997
03:04:09.90 --> 03:04:15.82
automate because your body wants to rest. Really? It wants to rest week. Your body wants to rest

2998
03:04:15.82 --> 03:04:21.42
every single day actually. You got to turn it from auto to manual. And you can get information like this

2999
03:04:21.42 --> 03:04:29.34
in psychological warfare on iTunes. The artist's name is Jockel Willing. The artist,

3000
03:04:29.34 --> 03:04:34.14
I never thought that I would be. I thought you had to paint something or sculpt something to be an artist.

3001
03:04:35.18 --> 03:04:39.58
Yeah, I thought that. I think it's. But now I put something on iTunes, then they just know

3002
03:04:39.58 --> 03:04:44.78
you're an artist now. Yeah. Jockel the heart if and I that. Well, I'm going to say they're

3003
03:04:44.78 --> 03:04:48.30
really stretching the words on that. But yeah, man, if you're, you know, if you're

3004
03:04:48.30 --> 03:04:54.78
slipping on the diet, waking up in the morning and you want to hit snooze, maybe postville in the

3005
03:04:54.78 --> 03:05:02.86
workout. And you want how should I say like a spot to switch the dial from automatic to manual?

3006
03:05:03.66 --> 03:05:09.58
That's what it is. So search psychological warfare on iTunes, Jockel Willing. Get after it.

3007
03:05:09.58 --> 03:05:14.38
It's a war on weakness. Yeah, big time. You know, when you're clicking through Amazon,

3008
03:05:14.38 --> 03:05:23.34
by the way, you can get Jockel White Tea there on Amazon. And, you know, when you get it,

3009
03:05:24.86 --> 03:05:31.34
I'm just going to say this, when you get it, you will see. And I'm going to give you one word just

3010
03:05:31.34 --> 03:05:37.98
to kind of what do what you anticipate. Just just think about this deadlift. That's what you're

3011
03:05:37.98 --> 03:05:42.70
going to be. So it's going to come to mind with the Jockel White Tea. It's going to be going up a lot.

3012
03:05:42.70 --> 03:05:49.18
So, and that's by the way, again, quadruple blind double tested that you're going to bring your,

3013
03:05:49.18 --> 03:05:53.90
you know, minimum, what's the lightest? I think the minimum that you're going to get deadlifting

3014
03:05:53.90 --> 03:05:59.90
is 8,000, 8,000 pounds. So get on that. You can also pre-order way the warrior kid. It comes out

3015
03:05:59.90 --> 03:06:09.98
May 2nd. By the way, it just came out on iTunes as one of the most anticipated books of the spring.

3016
03:06:09.98 --> 03:06:16.38
Oh, dang. It got listed. Right. How do you imagine that? Right. Kids book. Now all of a sudden we're

3017
03:06:16.38 --> 03:06:21.34
talking most anticipated book of the spring, which means people are waiting for it and they've ordered

3018
03:06:21.34 --> 03:06:27.82

3020
03:06:31.90 --> 03:06:36.70
bullies. Oh, yeah. Bullies are looking forward to it. I'll tell you who else isn't looking forward to this

3021
03:06:36.70 --> 03:06:44.94
coming out. Donut makers. People that make donuts. You know the gig is up. Weakness. You know

3022
03:06:44.94 --> 03:06:51.02
weakness is like a creature like a creature. Like a creature. Yeah. He's not looking forward to this

3023
03:06:51.02 --> 03:06:55.42
book come out because all those things are going down. All those things are trembling. Make those

3024
03:06:56.70 --> 03:07:04.46
things tremble harder, order, way the warrior kid. For your kid, for your neighbor's kid, and for

3025
03:07:04.46 --> 03:07:12.46

3026
03:07:12.46 --> 03:07:18.46
October 17th. I know it seems like a long time away, but I'm telling you you should pre-order it now.

3027
03:07:18.46 --> 03:07:23.50
Why? Because when you pre-order it, you will then know that it is coming.

3028
03:07:26.06 --> 03:07:33.02
And when you know it is coming, you will begin to prepare for it mentally and physically for this

3029
03:07:33.02 --> 03:07:39.74
book to arrive on your doorstep. You want to be ready mentally and physically because when you get this

3030
03:07:39.74 --> 03:07:46.30
book, you will have to do certain things. Namely, get after it. Yeah, that one.

3031
03:07:47.18 --> 03:07:51.18
Extreme ownership. Of course, the book, you can get it right now. You know if the weight at all.

3032
03:07:52.70 --> 03:07:59.66
Not just for you, but for your team, your spouse, your boss, your baby, center, your mother-in-law.

3033
03:07:59.66 --> 03:08:04.06
You know she needs a copy of that. She needs it. It takes ownership. So,

3034
03:08:04.06 --> 03:08:08.78
forever, copy, just be gentle with it. You don't have to throw it at her, but maybe just you

3035
03:08:08.78 --> 03:08:16.06
know place it on her desk. So, she can read it because the more people you get in the game and

3036
03:08:16.06 --> 03:08:20.78
start taking ownership of things, the better your life's going to be straight up. Now,

3037
03:08:20.78 --> 03:08:35.18
if that isn't enough of us, you can find us active on the interwebs, Twitter, Instagram,

3038
03:08:35.18 --> 03:08:41.66
and if you're going to look at that Facebook key, we're going to be there as well. Dave is at

3039
03:08:41.66 --> 03:08:51.50
David Burke. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willick. Echo Charles, any closing words?

3040
03:08:53.50 --> 03:08:56.38
I feel like we should talk about the movie top gun a little bit.

3041
03:08:56.38 --> 03:09:01.02
Right? No. Actually, one question, one question. You know how like when you watch top gun, right?

3042
03:09:01.02 --> 03:09:06.14
You of course, Maverick, that's your guy or goose, that's your guy. Did you like iceman?

3043
03:09:06.14 --> 03:09:12.46
Yeah, because he was pretty dope. You know what I'm talking about, all right? Absolutely. Who

3044
03:09:12.46 --> 03:09:19.42
doesn't like iceman? Absolutely. There it is. Yeah. Simple as that. That's your wrong question.

3045
03:09:19.42 --> 03:09:25.26
I'll find a question. Or did you ever buzz the tower? You don't see that never happen. Is that fake?

3046
03:09:25.26 --> 03:09:29.26
Is that like you can't really do that? You can't really do that. You can be in a ton of trouble.

3047
03:09:29.26 --> 03:09:33.74
As they said, you can do anything once. You can do that once and then what you're out. You're out.

3048
03:09:33.74 --> 03:09:42.94
But not if you're maverick. Awesome. Dave, man. Obviously thanks to Tom for coming on. You got

3049
03:09:42.94 --> 03:09:46.94
me up. You got me closing remarks and I'm sure we'll do this again and when you listen to this,

3050
03:09:46.94 --> 03:09:50.86
you'll think of a bunch of stuff that we should have said on this one. But anything else you

3051
03:09:50.86 --> 03:09:55.90
want to wrap it up with for today? Yeah, man. First, thanks. This was awesome. I've been thinking

3052
03:09:55.90 --> 03:09:59.10
about this for a couple of weeks. And we've been talking about it. I was super fired up to be here.

3053
03:09:59.10 --> 03:10:05.58
And this was awesome. You know, we were talking about it just briefly. And I mentioned it.

3054
03:10:05.58 --> 03:10:09.42
You know, my life obviously, I talked about the things that they went through.

3055
03:10:11.82 --> 03:10:15.90
So my life and my mom, you know, this is my family and those are folks that endure to whatever

3056
03:10:15.90 --> 03:10:19.34
degree that when you're removed, I think when you're on deployment, you do this stuff. It's hard.

3057
03:10:19.34 --> 03:10:23.10
But it's actually in some ways, harder for the people that you leave behind because they don't

3058
03:10:23.10 --> 03:10:27.02
know what's going on. They're just waiting and wondering and dealing with it and they're kind of

3059
03:10:27.02 --> 03:10:32.94
holding their breath. I remember a story that Whitney told me when I was deployed, I didn't think

3060
03:10:32.94 --> 03:10:38.46
about any of this stuff. A buddy of Niels had come to the house. He was gone. And he couldn't get

3061
03:10:38.46 --> 03:10:43.82
in the house. And he was knocking on the window, which was by the front of the house and kind of

3062
03:10:43.82 --> 03:10:48.46
ringing the doorbell. And it was a late night, like not a time that somebody should be at the door.

3063
03:10:49.02 --> 03:10:52.30
And she didn't want to answer the door. And she's telling me, and this stuff, you don't think

3064
03:10:52.30 --> 03:10:56.46
about that stuff. And you get back in here, the stories because you don't really think about what

3065
03:10:56.46 --> 03:11:00.62
your family's going through because you're busy and you're doing your thing. And she talked about

3066
03:11:01.34 --> 03:11:04.62
the thing that she hated the most was people knocking on the door because she was always just

3067
03:11:04.62 --> 03:11:10.14
sort of a tiny bit paranoid that it was going to be somebody coming to tell her about me.

3068
03:11:12.38 --> 03:11:18.14
You know, Chris's mom Kathy Leon who's someone I don't even have the words to describe how much I

3069
03:11:18.14 --> 03:11:24.54
love her and admire her. And it's not just about her loss. She obviously, she had to answer that call.

3070
03:11:24.54 --> 03:11:30.06
Well, you know, she had to take that call on June 20th, 2006. She took that phone call. But

3071
03:11:30.78 --> 03:11:36.22
that woman has endured the loss of a million who sacrificed herself on behalf of the entire

3072
03:11:36.22 --> 03:11:42.46
country. And my relationship, the irony in all this is that I would not, I would not have a relationship

3073
03:11:42.46 --> 03:11:48.38
with Kathy. And Chris wasn't killed. And I would give anything to take that day back and bring her

3074
03:11:48.38 --> 03:11:55.02
him home. I would trade any of it. But the goodness that comes out of that, there's always, there

3075
03:11:55.02 --> 03:12:01.26
is always some goodness. If you look for hard enough that comes out of all this stuff and the loss

3076
03:12:01.26 --> 03:12:07.50
and the things that you sacrifice. And I know Kathy is certainly listening and I never anticipated

3077
03:12:07.50 --> 03:12:12.54
having a relationship with someone like that based on those circumstances. But my relationship whether

3078
03:12:12.54 --> 03:12:17.90
it is really important. And what she is done for the country is really important. And if you look

3079
03:12:17.90 --> 03:12:22.94
hard enough in the worst situations, you find something that's good. And my relationship with her

3080
03:12:22.94 --> 03:12:27.18
is really good. And I would really, it would be wrong for me to go through this whole podcast and

3081
03:12:27.18 --> 03:12:33.34
talking to all those things without acknowledging that goodness with her. So I wanted to mention that.

3082
03:12:36.06 --> 03:12:44.22
Well, Dave, obviously, thanks for coming on. I know we've been talking about this for a while.

3083
03:12:44.22 --> 03:12:53.98
And it's great to have you on. And thanks for sharing your story with us, the story of you,

3084
03:12:53.98 --> 03:13:12.06
a marine fighter pilot, a forwarder controller, but also a son, a brother, a father, a person.

3085
03:13:12.06 --> 03:13:26.22
And yeah, thanks for sharing the story of Corporal Chris Leon, a marine no doubt.

3086
03:13:26.22 --> 03:13:44.46
A hero without question. But let us remember, let us always remember that these men,

3087
03:13:44.46 --> 03:13:54.86
these men, we call warriors, these men we call soldiers, these men we call marines,

3088
03:13:55.58 --> 03:14:06.46
these men we call heroes. But us never forget that they're people.

3089
03:14:06.46 --> 03:14:21.90
Suns and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, let us not forget that they're,

3090
03:14:21.90 --> 03:14:29.10
they're not only courageous, vigilant and bold and aggressive and inspiring,

3091
03:14:29.10 --> 03:14:39.66
but they're also funny and outrageous and flawed like any of us,

3092
03:14:43.34 --> 03:14:54.14
then that they're loving and loved, then that they're people,

3093
03:14:54.14 --> 03:15:07.98
people who left behind people, and those that are left behind, never forget,

3094
03:15:07.98 --> 03:15:24.46
like Chris Leon's mom Kathy Leon, who wrote, but note on his memorial page back in 2008.

3095
03:15:24.46 --> 03:15:35.10
And she said, hi baby, another difficult day to face without you here.

3096
03:15:38.46 --> 03:15:44.54
I never thought that memorial day would be in memory of you,

3097
03:15:44.54 --> 03:15:57.18
my dear sweet, beautiful sun. It's been one year, 11 months and five days,

3098
03:15:59.82 --> 03:16:04.70
so close to two years, then I cannot bear the thought.

3099
03:16:04.70 --> 03:16:14.38
We honor you by flying the flag every day and we will place

3100
03:16:15.26 --> 03:16:19.66
your American heroes tribute banner for all to see tomorrow.

3101
03:16:19.66 --> 03:16:34.14
Of course, we will cry more tears and maybe find a smile or laugh as we remember your deep voice,

3102
03:16:34.14 --> 03:16:46.78
great smile, joking sense of humor and the love you showed to us.

3103
03:16:48.46 --> 03:16:53.10
Our hearts are forever empty and broken without you.

3104
03:16:57.74 --> 03:17:00.94
Miss you so much and love you more.

3105
03:17:00.94 --> 03:17:07.98
All our love, moment had.

3106
03:17:07.98 --> 03:17:29.66
Remember, remember, major Henry L. Rodden,

3107
03:17:29.66 --> 03:17:42.86
remember, corporal Christopher Leon, remember those like them who have fallen.

3108
03:17:42.86 --> 03:18:03.26
Remember them as warriors, remember them as heroes, but always, always remember them,

3109
03:18:03.26 --> 03:18:14.78
as people. Remember them.

3110
03:18:14.78 --> 03:18:30.70
Until next time, this is Dave and Echo and Jockel out.
