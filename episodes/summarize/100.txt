And his jacket, he had what might look like sort of a shiny, like, like, like, break dancing jacket is kind of what it looked like with like the elastic tube portions on the wrists. It was now passed noon on the 15th of the ninth month of 1600 Though the typhoon had passed now and then fresh torrents of rain would fall on the corpses on the tickazos up turned face Each time it came he opened and closed his mouth like a fish trying to drink in the droplets It's like the water they wipe a dying man's lips with he reflected savoring each bit of moisture His head was numb his thoughts the fleeting shadows of delirium His side had lost He knew that much Hadiyaki supposedly an ally had been secretly in league with the eastern army and when it turned on Mitsunari's troops at twilight the tide of the battle turned to He then attacked the armies of the other commanders Yukita Shimazu Koneishi and the collapse of the western army was complete In only half a day is fighting the question of who would henceforth rule the country was settled It was Tokujawa Yasu the powerful edaiz dimo Images of his sister and the old villagers floated before his eyes I'm dying he thought Without a tinge of sadness Is this what it's really like He felt drawn to the piece of death like a child Mesmerized by a flame It was like pouring oil on the flames Ignoring their leader the priest began to shout saying talk was cheap it was time to fight They were enthusiastically seconded by the Ronin who had grouped themselves In close formation, Musashi's left screaming cursing and waving their swords in the air They egged the priests on into action Musashi convinced that the Ronin were all mouth and no fight Suddenly turned to them and shouted all right which one of you wants to come forward All but two or three fell back a plate pace Each sure that Musashi's evil eye was upon him Two or the two or three brave ones stood ready swords out stretched In issuing at the challenge In the wink of an eye Musashi was on one of them like a fighting cock There was a sound of a popping cork and the ground turned red Then came a chilling noise Not a battle cry, not a curse But a truly bud blood curdling howl Musashi's sword screeched back and forth through the air A reverberation in its own body In his own body telling him when he connected with human bone Blood and brain spattered from his blade Fingers and arms flew through the air Most of the time Musashi wasn't really conscious of what he was doing He was in a sort of trans, a murderous dream in which body and soul were concentrated in this free-foot sword Unconsciously his whole life experience The knowledge his father had beaten into him What he had learned at the Sega Jara I don't know, I was taking linguistic classes and they would point out these weird weird commonalities that you say, well, that's, you know, like things that like the number one things like the sun things that, you know, everyone kind of has to have created a word for it. Yeah I bet if we had, you know, those little Like meters where people can vote Or like this spike on the Presidents of the Bates where things would be like People really agree with this thing If you had that right there But as you mentioned I fasted for the first five days out of 10 because I wanted to see how that affected my state and and I sat during meals effectively meaning Meditated during those times as well and it was an intense Unexpectedly intense experience because it unlayers your psyche in a fashion that I hadn't experienced before since you have no distractions You're not permitted to read there's no music There's no talking you're discouraged from any writing There are no devices and That means there's no real escape from whatever is rick ashing inside your own head and as you go through the passing days you drop into deeper layers of your personality and the stories that you've constructed for yourself as well as direct experience in memories that you haven't thought of in my case 2025 years 30 years 35 years in some cases these very vivid intense memories that come back and so people have a very difficult time at points and the teachers are there every other day to interact on a one-on-one basis to ensure that people don't have a complete psychotic break I suppose Did you hear Random question, but would you hear people like crying yeah in their rooms or whatever heard people crying? It means I'd like to fight Yeah, and so he he's gonna go and and I'm gonna pull a couple highlights out of this thing, but but the this guy if you please so this guy agon he Immediately does like a practice run at some board that he puts his Lance right through and it's sort of like an intimidation Tagged it right. So I should have just said wooden sword In that in and then through his life He traveled and he did all kinds of things and he fought 60 sword duals I used to think that they were all to the death, but they actually weren't right there some of them were just like if I you could submit You know the opponent could just say yep, you won and you could agree to get beforehand what the rules of engagement would be Okay, so they could have a discussion and determine the extent to which you could inflict damage on the other person So they weren't all to the death they could have a basically gentlemen's agreements like let's not kill each other today Otherwise Yeah, it gives you that and actually somebody asked me that the other day I was doing an event and guys says you know how do you how do you recharge your batteries Like it just seems like you're going hard all the time how do you recharge your batteries And my initial I actually responded I said look I don't to be honest with you I don't really recharge I mean I'm just going and there's this He had some stuff like have battles against whole castles attack people he was kind of crazy and so his reputation and then of course you know this is like I guess ancient social media right there is rumors and they would post signs about people and they would do these things to denigrate people's reputation and such and they had done that considerably to Musashi. The theories he had heard at the various schools of swordsmanship The lessons taught to him by the mountains and trees Everything came into play in the rapid movements of his body He became a disembodied whirlwind Mowing down the herd of roen and who by their stunned bewilderment Left themselves wide open to his sword I'm trying to think of why these particular passages But one of the things you know this disembodiment Which I talk about all the time being able to be detached from what's happening is so important as a person as a leader and as a you know in more slots you have to do it too If you're getting so wrapped up around the thought of what's happening You you won't make good decisions, but this actually goes beyond it This this is like getting in the zone This is Like, like, the path is, it might not be like, I want to do this thing, like, there's something else. somewhere right I did so is my first 10 day you know what you know what my notes weren't here after I said that my notes are dude question mark like dude Dude Because that's what makes me think just like dude Okay, tell us about it a little bit. There's the trim work that all that little stuff that takes longer than you think it's gonna take well So to just set the stage a little bit number one You were on the spotcast before which was an awesome episode and you talked about some of your hard experiences growing up and Going through college and actually having suicidal thoughts and Beyond that suicidal plans that was podcast number 50 and it really helped out a lot of people I got an immense amount of great feedback from people and so thank you for doing that And on that podcast we also briefly discussed a novel called Musashi and It's just this incredible book that you'd read and I had read and the ending of the book is just full on epic and I was trying to think of how to explain In a culture like Japan in that period what showing up an hourly might equate to in the US it would be like coming over to meet someone at their house Shaking their hands sitting down at the dinner table then like getting up on the dinner table and taking a shit right on their He thought dimly a man might as well be a dead leaf floating in the autumn breeze He himself looked like one of the lifeless bodies surrounding him He tried to raise his head but could only lift it a few inches from the ground He couldn't remember ever feeling so weak How long have I been here he wondered Flies came buzzing around his head he wanted to brush them away but couldn't even muster the energy to raise his arm It was stiff almost brittle like the rest of his body I must have been out for quite a while he thought Wiggling one finger at a time Little did he know he was wounded with two bullets lodged firmly in his thigh Low dark clouds shifted ominously across the sky the night before sometime between midnight and dawn a blinding raid had Drenched the plane of But I remember at the time Looking at this book and reading about the As they would call it on the back cover the best selling samurai epic And somewhere Reading that this book has sold Something absurd like 20 million plus copies in a country of Whatever might be 150 million people That seems now that I've been through the book process a few times Like it cannot be true Almost as if I was one of their, like had that level of goodness, which I don't, you know, I mean, I'm trying, but you know, when I was a young seal, I was a maniac, you know, I made Mousashi look like a brilliant saint with his youth. but I understand what it means to be alive And now that I know my whole life will consist of being tied to this tree I can't undo what I've done You're finally coming to your senses For the first time in your life you're talking like a human being I don't want to die Takazawa cried I want to live I want to go out try again do everything right this time His body convulsed with his sobbing Takuan please help me help me The monk shook his head I was just thinking about how labor intensive it would be you're telling us spreading posters like to hand create piles of posters that you then go post to denigrate someone like the equivalent of a tweet was sitting down for a week and hand making posters put around town and they do it in this book they don't know it's full time as they go on both sides people if you see the play the same thing I haven't seen it It's like with kind of regards after you basically say I want to meet you and do the old shooting The face with kind of regards and wishes for your continued health You know we've lost that there's something to that isn't there You know like can't you just have a feud and still be respectful to someone So you'd have like one guy with a garden hose and then another guy with like I kind of sword with like the tip cut off that's played open and he can catch people in a Guilty in from any conceivable position that most people wouldn't even consider a position Yeah, I've seen him I've seen him catch people in Guilty in people who weigh 300 pounds And not fat 300 like big big big people I mean, do that for like two minutes and we crack up and loosen up and realize, okay, everyone who's learning a new language has some type of sticking point like this and then he'd be like, okay enough fun and games now back to the hard stuff. yeah, it was a fun time days We get when you get to sleep deprivation which I've gone through some significantly sleep deprivation You know you have those kind of you know you take a trip without leaving the farm type situations and for me it was nothing Nothing crazy or anything you know I remember seeing stop signs in the ocean and Traffic lights in the ocean and stuff like that's not crazy. and I would not recommend it for most people really because I would have left The retreat three or four times probably were it not for one particular teacher Who had decades of experience with tens of thousands of retreating Because I felt like I was going to leave in worship that I came in that I had regressed to a very reactive emotional state and that it was going to be a huge handicap when I left I felt like I was regressing tremendously Like I watch people like a jerk like, why would you do that? My intention being to travel around in general area of Egan, ESA For about a year to continue my study of swordsmanship I did not wish to change my plans at this time But since I regret as much as you do that I was unable to meet you during my previous visit to your school I should like to inform you that I shall certainly be back in the capital By the first or second months of next year Between now and then I expect to improve my technique considerably I trust that you yourself will not neglect your practice It would be a great shame If Yoshiyoka Campos Flourishing school Were to suffer a second defeat like the one that sustained last time I was there In closing I send my respectful wishes for your continued health You're welcome and he was able to Write the ship a little bit along the way, but if if he had not been there and I had left Even on day nine I remember I was like People are supposed to be in this deep state of bliss or at least that was my perception I feel like I've just been rubbed rod all these nerves that I've numbed from difficult experiences in childhood and so on I have just been exposed to the surface Real quick though, it's far as pronunciation goes when there's like a double consonant you kind of say them both like like this Dakota you say, don't code. Yeah, and it's another, again, I know I don't relate to every normal person at all in very little ways, but like when I read that, I'm always like, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. and they don't move that's something I've said many many times Um Musashi then says after he does this you know like this crazy scream and puts his Lance through the wood He says are you ready now Back to the book this solicitor drove agon wild his muscles were like steel when he jumped he did so with awesome lightness I think it's like and then asking them to clean it up because it smells bad like it would be it would be that rude so of course and it also made me think of this book. that's Totally true totally true one quick story about Marcello, which also makes me you can tell Marcello's story I think about Musashi is he's famous for being hard to find when he gets called to the mat when it's his turn to compete Even at a world championship level and He is almost always found because Josh has had to track him down a few times a sleep Like in between the bleachers and like we're selling I mean, I will say, for this people out there, like, well, forgot to say, like, I don't know what my path is, I can't define it. But a lot of these languages like the, you know, even the pronunciation of like, A is A. You know, Japanese Hawaiian. But since the time of our first master the Hose Wayne has been celebrated everywhere for its Lands techniques the fighting that goes on here is a rough and there are no exceptions Before you go on perhaps you better read what's written at the beginning of the registry Hose Wayne picked up the book opened it and read the stipulation which he had skipped over before It said having come here for the purpose of study I absolve the temple of all responsibility in the event that I suffer Bottily injury or I'm killed I agreed to that said Hose Wayne with a slight grin It amounted to no more than the common sense for anyone committed to becoming a warrior all right this way So that's the introduction and that's actually cool too That's an old school jiu-jitsu thing when you come in for the other thing that would happen is challenge matches You know, like it's like you are not going to be able to do this to me right now because it's too slippery. Especially like the, like Turkish get the snatch to, like these ones where snatch of you take it. and I was as actually just Looking forward to describing the experience to our mutual friend Dr. Peter Tia who may be the most like cerebral intense impatient And a little person I've ever met to agree that even I find hilarious which is difficult to achieve in this world in this life and his level of obsession and perseverating on concepts and endlessly makes me want to do a second retreat with Peter When he's not allowed to tell me how he's feeling because I think the more you have Run your life through your prefrontal cortex the heart of you fall and you see what he's thinking about he's probably thinking about Like chicken Yeah, for dinner or whatever you know, I mean like his thoughts are just not there There's a certain agitation, there's a certain scattered feeling that I have, and as to reasons people get off the path, and I think people may have multiple paths, but you're going to say, that was going to say, because I've been, I'm trying to formulate what we're talking about, because I know exactly what you mean. His feet seemed to be on the floor and in the air at the same time quivering like the moonlight on ocean waves Musashi stood perfectly still or so it seemed there was nothing unusual about his stance He held his sword straight out with both hands, but being slightly smaller than his opponent and not so conspicuously muscular He looked almost casual the greatest difference was in their eyes Musashi's were sharp as a bird their pupils a clear coral tinted with blood Agon shook his head perhaps to shake off the streams and sweat pouring down from his forehead perhaps to shake off the old man's warning words had they lingered on Was he attempting to cast him out of his mind whatever the reason he was extremely agitated He repeatedly shifted his position trying to draw out Musashi, but Musashi remained motionless Agon's lunch was accompanied by a piercing scream in the split second that decided the encounter Musashi paried in counterattack What happened? And I think maybe people don't want to accept the fact, like, they know what the path is, but they want to deny it for whatever reason. so you have kaki kukikou Mami mume mama sashi tsuse sayesul and Which is part of the reason much Japanese have so much trouble with almost every language they kind of got robbed when like the gods were handing out sounds So they're trouble with a lot of languages Including English but nonetheless those were simplified versions of The characters so for instance the character for That you could say represents peace in Chinese which is unso if for instance like A piece the word in Chinese would be unchuan And then you can at least at a minimum get a different perspective from different people, which just like for our work week for me is very important to see different people's angles on the way they look at things. And honestly, what's jacked up Is that the guys are actually trying to do the right thing They're actually trying They're looking at a girl saying, look You don't want to sign up for this Like this is not going to be fun I'm just like the only book you think about as this book, giraffe's can't dance, which is the one book that beats you because I know that's what you're focused on. So I have everything locked and loaded and ready to go for all these books that I've read I think it'd be awesome especially because like for instance, you know, I do books about war primarily Because that's what I can relate to the most but you know, if you were reading business books And then just then just proceed it to beat the living shit out of him with a stick on the ground That's not fun I don't like that triangle defense I don't like that at all I think we're getting into another Just just good Yeah, actually, I was thinking about this On your podcast It would be awesome if you did like If you did like the jobs book Cool and who like get up and stretch and literally walk 50 feet like Seven seconds later on to the mat for the finals and the world championships and just turn it on and then just throw people Yeah The adversaries he hit I'm not going to do is go to job of reading his Jacko, he's been his well-practiced, plus he has the audiobook voice of Jacko, we're like The adversaries he had defeated, even the ones he had killed or half killed always disappeared from his mind Like so much froth he's he's just Kind of like the kimera after which the kamura is named So who was a very famous jiu-jitsu Fought Helio Gracie People in Japan used to say before kimera no kimera after kimera no kimera Like a nongering phenomenon Like, even if you want it like whatever the next day, you know. But if you're stuck in say the weather patterns of the world instead of looking at sort of the tectonic plate level and you're focused on these things it change very very quickly like the news cycle like what your friends are saying on social media at all times. And we got in this conversation like about, you know, doing good and these guys are just levels infinite levels above me as far as being good people. So when you want when you want to do that little function to separate them, you put the Okina there like like the word Hawaii, Hawaii, there's two eyes of Dan. And so believe me, I'm not trying to say that, but I will say that as I've grown up, I've, I've think I've got myself closer to living the way that I know I'm supposed to live or I, the what I believe to be the right way and the right path to be on. He's going and trying to farm and do another things and this guy's kind of on the scene and there's there's one part where these elderly gentleman are talking about who is truly the best swordsman slash samurai in Japan and here we go to the book as he compared the two he had to admit that the most Dimeo and I said that right time you dimeo dimeo would prefer Kuduro he came from a good family and he had started the art of war thoroughly despite his youth he developed a formable style of his own and he gained considerable fame as a fighter. and I remember like oh people were just learning what a triangle choke was I was like They're very rarely disputes But it's so subtle and the the misses are so close, much like really maybe hot really really high level boxing I mean when someone parries it's not like it's traveling a foot to the side of their head Said to me, relax your eyes because underwater, when I'm holding like 250 pound dumbbells, understandably my eyes are bugging out of my head and she's like you're burning too much energy. It's about tennis, but it relates to this form of psychological warfare and like taking too much time like in between serves and making your opponent unnerved So that even if they're technically superior you can end up beating them and And that's also ego issues Clearly, those are people are hard to deal with Unless you recognize that it's your own ego that's causing these problems Because a lot of people are so intimidated by I've seen that many times where you get like a young seal that's a real badass when he's coming up And some of the senior seals, maybe that are also badass You basically get two alpha males in a room But I think that from a psychological perspective, I think what's given me a good perspective of my own psychology is watching other people intently and closely with the goal of actually helping them correct that, of going up to the guy and say, hey man, this is your ego versus that guy's ego. But then there's like this one more level of guys that are you look at when you go man that guys really good what why is that that's because that guy the machine got him to hear and he's looking at himself going what can I do better She understands, like, this is his path, he's still chasing giants, and he's not going to stop, how could he, like, that's part of who he is. But I guess by those working with the company the other day and a guy asked, you know, if I've got a guy that's really good at something, but a person that's not really good should I just give up on trying to get the person that's not good at that job, give up on them and just let the person that's good at it, do it. And if you watch Kenno, let's say YouTube and imagine what the eye contact is like, if their eyes are like wide open staring at each other, it adds another layer of flavor to the entire experience. There's people with like hair or something like that. Like I'm not going to jump on your little band like I see what you're doing. So it could have been in English and in a lot of languages It often relates to an early vocation So far as, for instance, comes from far as Like FER or OUS, like Far as Oxide, Iron I don't know if non-Japanese do it, but in Japan, when I was watching certain people, or competing myself and you'd hear people like you. And we will He's in the name of the story The main point is that even though he desires her and wants to be with her at the same time There's something that's more important to him And that is the way of the sword So here we go Back to the book, Musashi covered her small white hand Which was resting on the railing with his own Listen, he said plaintively I beg of you, just stop and think What's there to think about? But what's cool is you get a book like tribe of mentors and you can kind of get a feel for what other people's paths are and how they stay on them and way they live their lives. But yeah, you definitely that that's when I hear because I've never tried psychedelic drugs and When I would people talk about them to me it does not sound fun to me because I think that where I think that Where I would end up would not be I happy place and I don't really Need to hang out there very much and I should I should also say that I don't in the case of the silent retreat or in the case of Psychedelics do it for fun and And I've had a few people ask me And I carried it around giving myself Scoliosis for years and years because I was so intimidated by this thing It's a few inches thick the paper is it's like onion skin That's like An episode talking about it as you look back on it right now your brain is it still still 70% there And they told us at the end which I thought was very appropriate because it applies to so many things They said or one of the teachers said you're you think you're normal right now and you're not you're very Hypersensitive your retreat is half done so it'll take 10 days the equivalent amount of time to reintegrate and get retethered Like after that I was like, yes, we are going to work together. And then the eyes like E. Yeah, Japanese people can handle Spanish is probably the closest that I've seen language that they can handle any language that ends on consonants a lot is going to be so. Because I figured like my reflexes are pretty good, but the reflexes of head movement in kendo Bad idea you always want to have the sword in between You and your opponent and to protect the center line So if you start moving your head or your shoulders In such a way that you might say of a vape punch you really expose yourself Man, I wish I had somebody that worked with me, that like did computer type stuff and stuff like that. Because if you have a straight blade, or relatively straight blade, like Katana, it's almost like having a straight blade-ed hatchet that you swing into a tree.
