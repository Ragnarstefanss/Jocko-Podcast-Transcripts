00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.48
This is Jockel Podcast number 139.

2
00:00:04.48 --> 00:00:07.84
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:07.84 --> 00:00:08.84
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:08.84 --> 00:00:09.84
Good evening.

5
00:00:09.84 --> 00:00:16.64
I live to while on Karegador Island.

6
00:00:16.64 --> 00:00:20.52
That sun baked God cursed land.

7
00:00:20.52 --> 00:00:28.08
Where bomb and shell made life a hell with death on every hand.

8
00:00:28.08 --> 00:00:33.76
I got the thirst there of the cursed with no water to be had.

9
00:00:33.76 --> 00:00:41.48
I heard men scream in hellish dreams and watched my friends go mad.

10
00:00:41.48 --> 00:00:48.68
To his no man's fault, the water, salt, or that the food is gone.

11
00:00:48.68 --> 00:00:57.32
The guns are manned by men full-damped, facing each new dawn.

12
00:00:57.32 --> 00:01:04.000
When our bones blend with the stones, you'll hear the parents cry.

13
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:16.92
The men who owned these splintered bones were not afraid to die.

14
00:01:16.92 --> 00:01:25.44
And that is a poem written on the back of a scrap of paper, postmarked prisoner of

15
00:01:25.44 --> 00:01:29.12
the war male March 1943.

16
00:01:29.12 --> 00:01:39.60
The note was addressed to James D. Culp, US Navy, gunners made first class via his wife

17
00:01:39.60 --> 00:01:48.08
from the red cross while he was in a prisoner of war camp in Osaka, Japan.

18
00:01:48.08 --> 00:01:49.76
And the author is unknown.

19
00:01:49.76 --> 00:01:52.20
So it wasn't written by James D. Culp.

20
00:01:52.20 --> 00:01:55.04
It was sent to James D. Culp.

21
00:01:55.04 --> 00:02:01.64
The author is unknown, but it's assumed to be one of Culp's fellow prisoners that was captured

22
00:02:01.64 --> 00:02:06.52
on the Philippine island of Keregador.

23
00:02:06.52 --> 00:02:18.32
And the fall of the Philippine's World War II resulted in an absolutely horrific event

24
00:02:18.32 --> 00:02:26.48
that resulted in the deaths of thousands of American and Filipino service members.

25
00:02:26.48 --> 00:02:37.16
And there's not any great records of how many actually died in this terrible situation,

26
00:02:37.16 --> 00:02:45.40
but throughout the prisoner of war camps of the Japanese in World War II, the death rate

27
00:02:45.40 --> 00:02:50.20
was about 40%, it was a nightmare.

28
00:02:50.20 --> 00:02:59.000
And this is about the baton death march.

29
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.12
And we've heard a little bit about what the Japanese did to prisoners of war in World

30
00:03:04.12 --> 00:03:05.12
War II.

31
00:03:05.12 --> 00:03:14.40
We read the forgotten Highlander by Alistar U.Cart, and that was podcast number 12.

32
00:03:14.40 --> 00:03:19.28
He didn't talk about the baton death march, but today we're going to hear from someone

33
00:03:19.28 --> 00:03:29.60
that did the baton death march, a guy by the name of James Bollick, a young member of the

34
00:03:29.60 --> 00:03:38.88
Army Air Corps who suffered through that terrible situation.

35
00:03:38.88 --> 00:03:46.000
So we wrote a book about it, the book is called Usoldiers Journal by James Bollick.

36
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.68
And let's get right into it.

37
00:03:49.68 --> 00:03:52.32
Going to the book.

38
00:03:52.32 --> 00:03:59.68
I joined the service August 23rd, 1940 at Barclay Field, Shreafport, Louisiana, and was

39
00:03:59.68 --> 00:04:03.72
assigned to the 16th bomb squadron, 27th bomb group.

40
00:04:03.72 --> 00:04:08.56
I joined because Paris had just fallen to the Germans and I felt we would soon be at

41
00:04:08.56 --> 00:04:10.24
war.

42
00:04:10.24 --> 00:04:13.56
I was in college at the time and just finished my third semester.

43
00:04:13.56 --> 00:04:18.24
All the talk around school is about war and it was hard to keep my mind on books.

44
00:04:18.24 --> 00:04:23.52
I was attending Southwestern Louisiana Institute in Lafayette through a government

45
00:04:23.52 --> 00:04:27.92
program called the NYA, the National Youth Administration.

46
00:04:27.92 --> 00:04:34.44
We received $30 a month and had to work for eight hours every other day.

47
00:04:34.44 --> 00:04:39.20
Because of this, it was hard to schedule classes and hard to study properly.

48
00:04:39.20 --> 00:04:45.52
From our $30 pay, we had to put about $18 each month for Roman board, which left $12

49
00:04:45.52 --> 00:04:50.48
for other essentials such as books, paper, pencils, etc.

50
00:04:50.48 --> 00:04:55.76
Because going to college was so difficult under these circumstances, it seemed that the

51
00:04:55.76 --> 00:04:58.36
Army could not be any worse.

52
00:04:58.36 --> 00:05:02.000
So go to join the Army.

53
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.52
I went home and told my parents what I planned to do, my mother was horrified and strictly

54
00:05:06.52 --> 00:05:08.32
against it.

55
00:05:08.32 --> 00:05:12.28
At the time I needed my parents consent to join because of my age, I was 19.

56
00:05:12.28 --> 00:05:16.32
My father agreed to sign and convinced my mother to sign also.

57
00:05:16.32 --> 00:05:20.72
I remember her saying that if anything happened to me, she did not want to be blamed for letting

58
00:05:20.72 --> 00:05:23.32
me go in the Army.

59
00:05:23.32 --> 00:05:25.76
I was sworn in with the rest of the recruits.

60
00:05:25.76 --> 00:05:30.44
I had a choice of joining a weather squadron or a bombardment squadron.

61
00:05:30.44 --> 00:05:32.64
Of course I chose the bombardment squadron.

62
00:05:32.64 --> 00:05:35.48
I did not join the Army to study the weather.

63
00:05:35.48 --> 00:05:37.12
I joined a fight.

64
00:05:37.12 --> 00:05:39.04
That is what I thought.

65
00:05:39.04 --> 00:05:45.20
I was there for assigned to the 16th bomb squadron to the 27th bomb group.

66
00:05:45.20 --> 00:05:50.16
Army closed and equipment at this time were in short supply and were not provided and we

67
00:05:50.16 --> 00:05:52.28
were not provided with clothes, etc.

68
00:05:52.28 --> 00:05:57.72
For quite some time, obviously my statement that I always make is I'm skipping big chunks

69
00:05:57.72 --> 00:06:02.64
to this book and reading some of the highlights so you get the flow of the story before

70
00:06:02.64 --> 00:06:06.24
we get into the meat of the book.

71
00:06:06.24 --> 00:06:07.24
It's a great book.

72
00:06:07.24 --> 00:06:12.68
It's a relatively short read, but it's a great book.

73
00:06:12.68 --> 00:06:13.68
Back to the book.

74
00:06:13.68 --> 00:06:17.24
The clothing we had was essentially still World War I.

75
00:06:17.24 --> 00:06:20.12
We had leggings, campaign hats, etc.

76
00:06:20.12 --> 00:06:21.60
At this time.

77
00:06:21.60 --> 00:06:25.84
Then he ends up going to a school to learn his skills about bombing.

78
00:06:25.84 --> 00:06:29.32
Back to the book, the school lasted about nine months and I came out knowing everything

79
00:06:29.32 --> 00:06:31.44
there was to know about her airplane.

80
00:06:31.44 --> 00:06:35.92
When school was over from my class, I was offered a position as instructor of drafting,

81
00:06:35.92 --> 00:06:37.36
but I turned it down.

82
00:06:37.36 --> 00:06:42.56
I wanted to get back with my outfit and his outfit was down in Savannah.

83
00:06:42.56 --> 00:06:48.08
When I got back to Savannah, I found out my outfit packing up to go on maneuvers in Louisiana.

84
00:06:48.08 --> 00:06:52.84
Within a few days, we were on our way by Army Truck.

85
00:06:52.84 --> 00:06:56.28
Tonight we would stop, set up our mess tent, eat, and hit the sack.

86
00:06:56.28 --> 00:06:58.48
We slept on the ground under a pup tent.

87
00:06:58.48 --> 00:07:02.96
It took us two or three days to reach our final stop, which was at the airfield at Lake

88
00:07:02.96 --> 00:07:04.28
Charles.

89
00:07:04.28 --> 00:07:08.40
Here we lived in tents, again just as our first days in Savannah.

90
00:07:08.40 --> 00:07:11.80
As far as I was concerned at the time, maneuvers were a joke.

91
00:07:11.80 --> 00:07:16.000
Instead of having actual machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, foxholes, etc, there were

92
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.32
wooden signs all around to indicate these.

93
00:07:19.32 --> 00:07:23.92
If the air raid siren went off, we were supposed to run out to one of these signs.

94
00:07:23.92 --> 00:07:29.52
The way that one of the maneuvers did apparently help us with down the line was to adapt

95
00:07:29.52 --> 00:07:32.44
to hard, rough, outdoor living.

96
00:07:32.44 --> 00:07:39.84
We were also on reduced rations, which helped prepare us for what was to come later on.

97
00:07:39.84 --> 00:07:44.12
We were fly over the enemy and drop small sacks of flour on them.

98
00:07:44.12 --> 00:07:47.88
Referees could tell if we hit or missed, and the sides were scored accordingly.

99
00:07:47.88 --> 00:07:52.64
I don't remember how long these maneuvers lasted, but it seems like it was at least a month.

100
00:07:52.64 --> 00:07:53.64
They're out there.

101
00:07:53.64 --> 00:07:57.96
I thought this was interesting because we do dumb stuff like that sometimes in the military

102
00:07:57.96 --> 00:07:59.84
where you think it's dumb.

103
00:07:59.84 --> 00:08:05.000
What you're really trying to do is get the broad muscle movements of a military organization

104
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
working.

105
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.76
You say, okay, because it's not easy to get 500 men assembled and moved to a location, it

106
00:08:11.76 --> 00:08:13.76
takes practice.

107
00:08:13.76 --> 00:08:17.68
They just run people through planning and training exercises that you're just trying

108
00:08:17.68 --> 00:08:21.32
to get these broad muscle movements, even though for the troops in the ground sometimes,

109
00:08:21.32 --> 00:08:23.28
I remember sometimes I'd be thinking, this is ridiculous.

110
00:08:23.28 --> 00:08:27.40
This is so unrealistic, but we weren't training the different line troops.

111
00:08:27.40 --> 00:08:30.44
What they were training was the logistics of this giant scenario.

112
00:08:30.44 --> 00:08:34.000
So that's kind of what they're doing here.

113
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Back to the book.

114
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.24
We finally got word to pack up and headed back home to Savannah.

115
00:08:38.24 --> 00:08:42.80
We'd already gotten word that as soon as we reach Savannah, we would need to pack again.

116
00:08:42.80 --> 00:08:46.80
This time to go overseas, but no one knew where as yet.

117
00:08:46.80 --> 00:08:51.48
So again, Germany, France had fallen to Germany or Paris had fallen to Germany, but we weren't

118
00:08:51.48 --> 00:08:52.48
in the war yet.

119
00:08:52.48 --> 00:08:56.72
So this is pre-World War II for America at this time.

120
00:08:56.72 --> 00:09:02.16
So he's just thinking he's going on a regular kind of deployment at this point.

121
00:09:02.16 --> 00:09:03.16
Back to the book.

122
00:09:03.16 --> 00:09:05.64
When we reached Savannah, we found that most of our gear that we had left behind was already

123
00:09:05.64 --> 00:09:07.20
created and ready to go.

124
00:09:07.20 --> 00:09:11.68
As I recall, in about a week or so, we boarded the train for San Francisco.

125
00:09:11.68 --> 00:09:18.92
All of our crates were stenciled with the letter letters PLUM Plum, but no one knew it meant.

126
00:09:18.92 --> 00:09:22.32
I should mention here that before we left Savannah, I was called to the first sergeant's

127
00:09:22.32 --> 00:09:26.36
office and told that I did not have to go overseas if I did not want to.

128
00:09:26.36 --> 00:09:30.60
Of course, I immediately rejected the idea and said I definitely wanted to go.

129
00:09:30.60 --> 00:09:34.32
To this day, I don't know why this came up because I'm talking to others in my outfit

130
00:09:34.32 --> 00:09:37.52
and no one had had that opportunity.

131
00:09:37.52 --> 00:09:41.64
Since I had applied for flight school, it may be that I could have gone there.

132
00:09:41.64 --> 00:09:43.28
So he didn't mention his property.

133
00:09:43.28 --> 00:09:44.28
He wanted to be a pilot.

134
00:09:44.28 --> 00:09:48.40
So they could have been a possibility that they wanted to send him a flight school.

135
00:09:48.40 --> 00:09:53.40
But of course, like many young, 19-year-old men, what you want to do is you want to stick

136
00:09:53.40 --> 00:09:55.28
with your unit, you want to go and fight.

137
00:09:55.28 --> 00:10:00.24
And at this point, he's no easy fighting, but he wants to go deploy with his guys.

138
00:10:00.24 --> 00:10:01.24
Back to the book.

139
00:10:01.24 --> 00:10:05.24
I still don't know what Plum stood for, but looking back now, apparently the P stood for

140
00:10:05.24 --> 00:10:13.76
Philippines, the L stood for the island of Luzon, but the UNM, I do not know.

141
00:10:13.76 --> 00:10:15.96
That's awesome.

142
00:10:15.96 --> 00:10:20.72
Now they get to San Francisco eventually and here we go.

143
00:10:20.72 --> 00:10:22.24
They're boarding the ship back to the book.

144
00:10:22.24 --> 00:10:27.24
The SS Coolidge was a lovely ship that normally carried civilian passengers to the Orient.

145
00:10:27.24 --> 00:10:29.68
But now it was being used to transport troops.

146
00:10:29.68 --> 00:10:34.28
We did not have state rooms, but slept in quarters comparable to regular army transports.

147
00:10:34.28 --> 00:10:37.16
But the third day we found out where we were going.

148
00:10:37.16 --> 00:10:38.28
Up to this time, no one knew.

149
00:10:38.28 --> 00:10:42.16
Our squadron commander called us together and told us we were headed for the Philippine

150
00:10:42.16 --> 00:10:43.16
Islands.

151
00:10:43.16 --> 00:10:48.20
He told us that we were the first part of an expeditionary force being sent out to beef

152
00:10:48.20 --> 00:10:51.68
up the defenses of the Philippines.

153
00:10:51.68 --> 00:10:54.52
After this talk, I don't remember anyone getting very excited about it.

154
00:10:54.52 --> 00:10:57.84
We all went back to killing time and doing things that we were doing before.

155
00:10:57.84 --> 00:11:00.56
Some people read, some gambled, and some exercised.

156
00:11:00.56 --> 00:11:03.92
There was light boxing going on, so I decided I would participate.

157
00:11:03.92 --> 00:11:08.68
I boxed as a light weight at 165 pounds.

158
00:11:08.68 --> 00:11:14.72
I mentioned 165 pounds because that weight is going to go away.

159
00:11:14.72 --> 00:11:19.24
Honolulu is a place where I finally learned the port and starboard sides of a ship.

160
00:11:19.24 --> 00:11:21.32
On large ships I still get lost and confused.

161
00:11:21.32 --> 00:11:25.04
I had to go out on deck to see which way the boat was traveling, cloaking it myself.

162
00:11:25.04 --> 00:11:26.04
This is funny.

163
00:11:26.04 --> 00:11:27.44
You get it first, get on a ship.

164
00:11:27.44 --> 00:11:28.84
You have no idea where you are.

165
00:11:28.84 --> 00:11:32.60
And there's a system in a ship that you can use to figure out in the mark.

166
00:11:32.60 --> 00:11:37.000
Well, Navy ships, they mark it very clearly, but it takes a little time to get used to

167
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.56
and apparently he didn't get taught.

168
00:11:40.56 --> 00:11:45.68
We finally left the dock and as we pulled out of pull harbor, saw the ships with our planes

169
00:11:45.68 --> 00:11:48.52
coming in.

170
00:11:48.52 --> 00:11:52.64
We never saw our planes again and little did we realize what would happen to Pearl Harbor

171
00:11:52.64 --> 00:11:55.40
in just a few short weeks.

172
00:11:55.40 --> 00:11:58.84
This is pre-Purl Harbor.

173
00:11:58.84 --> 00:12:03.08
Because they set sail throughout its sea back to the book one morning when I got up and

174
00:12:03.08 --> 00:12:04.08
went out on deck.

175
00:12:04.08 --> 00:12:05.68
I noticed islands all around us.

176
00:12:05.68 --> 00:12:08.84
We were finally in the Philippines.

177
00:12:08.84 --> 00:12:13.80
Just as soon as we got off the ship, we loaded into Army trucks and were taken to Fort McKinley.

178
00:12:13.80 --> 00:12:16.68
I should point out here that during the peacetime, I like this part.

179
00:12:16.68 --> 00:12:20.44
I should point out here that during peacetime in the Philippines prior to our arrival, the

180
00:12:20.44 --> 00:12:26.08
military was on duty only in the morning from 8 o'clock to 11 o'clock.

181
00:12:26.08 --> 00:12:31.44
It was thought that a white person could not survive in tropical sun after 11 o'clock.

182
00:12:31.44 --> 00:12:36.60
What a deal they had and to top it off, time spent in the tropics, Hawaii included, counted

183
00:12:36.60 --> 00:12:39.64
as time and a half toward retirement.

184
00:12:39.64 --> 00:12:43.84
Another reason we were so honours when we first arrived in the tropics was the fact that

185
00:12:43.84 --> 00:12:45.68
we still had our winter uniforms.

186
00:12:45.68 --> 00:12:49.68
So I thought that was pretty funny to think about that.

187
00:12:49.68 --> 00:12:50.68
That's not that.

188
00:12:50.68 --> 00:12:52.16
This is the 1940s that I think I looked.

189
00:12:52.16 --> 00:12:53.16
You're not going to make it.

190
00:12:53.16 --> 00:12:54.40
Hey, listen up, white boy.

191
00:12:54.40 --> 00:13:00.84
You're not going to make it past 11, you need to go back in the shade.

192
00:13:00.84 --> 00:13:01.84
Back to the book.

193
00:13:01.84 --> 00:13:05.12
As long as I was at Fort McKinley about two weeks, the only thing I ever did was dig trenches

194
00:13:05.12 --> 00:13:06.12
around the fort.

195
00:13:06.12 --> 00:13:10.08
These were not foxholes but long zigzag trenches.

196
00:13:10.08 --> 00:13:13.32
We were undoubtedly preparing for war.

197
00:13:13.32 --> 00:13:14.32
Then they go out.

198
00:13:14.32 --> 00:13:17.68
They catch a movie.

199
00:13:17.68 --> 00:13:18.68
Back to the book.

200
00:13:18.68 --> 00:13:22.16
After the movie, we took a tram or trolley back to the gate at Fort McKinley.

201
00:13:22.16 --> 00:13:25.56
Before going to our tent, we decided to stop the mess tent for something to drink before

202
00:13:25.56 --> 00:13:26.56
retiring.

203
00:13:26.56 --> 00:13:31.56
And that is when we heard that Pearl Harbor was being jumped bombed by the Japanese.

204
00:13:31.56 --> 00:13:34.28
This message came from a radio that was playing in a mess tent.

205
00:13:34.28 --> 00:13:37.68
And I suspect we were one of the first to hear the news.

206
00:13:37.68 --> 00:13:42.56
I was not terribly surprised or concerned because we'd been preparing for war and now

207
00:13:42.56 --> 00:13:43.56
it was here.

208
00:13:43.56 --> 00:13:47.56
I was not frightened by the news and remember going to bed and immediately falling asleep

209
00:13:47.56 --> 00:13:49.36
because the hour was very late.

210
00:13:49.36 --> 00:13:54.36
I know I would have been frightened if I had known what terrible destruction the Japanese

211
00:13:54.36 --> 00:13:58.12
had inflicted on our forces at Pearl Harbor.

212
00:13:58.12 --> 00:14:02.24
We never knew about our terrible losses until the war was over.

213
00:14:02.24 --> 00:14:09.08
I am sure our top brass knew but we were never told which I am sure was best.

214
00:14:09.08 --> 00:14:12.96
I may not have been scared the night when I heard that the war started but I would be

215
00:14:12.96 --> 00:14:16.36
lying if I said I was not scared when the second night rolled around.

216
00:14:16.36 --> 00:14:21.76
The day started with an early frantic call before breakfast for all to us immediately assembled

217
00:14:21.76 --> 00:14:23.60
from the first sergeants tent.

218
00:14:23.60 --> 00:14:29.20
I had a pretty good idea of what it was all about but most of the outfit had not yet heard.

219
00:14:29.20 --> 00:14:35.28
Anyway we were told we were now at war with Japan and would be issued arms and ammunition.

220
00:14:35.28 --> 00:14:39.48
So just like that, everything changes.

221
00:14:39.48 --> 00:14:45.56
I was issued a 30 caliber springfield rifle and a 45 caliber cult automatic pistol.

222
00:14:45.56 --> 00:14:47.64
And we were air core personnel.

223
00:14:47.64 --> 00:14:52.52
We had never received instructions on firing a rifle and a lot of these men had never

224
00:14:52.52 --> 00:14:54.60
had a rifle in their hands before.

225
00:14:54.60 --> 00:14:56.44
A lot were like me however.

226
00:14:56.44 --> 00:15:01.28
They were farm boys who were brought up with guns and knew how to use them.

227
00:15:01.28 --> 00:15:06.52
So again these guys it's a peace time and even though they might have been preparing for

228
00:15:06.52 --> 00:15:11.14
war it's a peace time situation and you know how I talk about when you are training

229
00:15:11.14 --> 00:15:15.70
in GJT so you can't train hard enough to be prepared for a car.

230
00:15:15.70 --> 00:15:19.14
You can't train the same way a competition field so you just can't.

231
00:15:19.14 --> 00:15:20.46
It's the same way here.

232
00:15:20.46 --> 00:15:23.58
When there's no war going on I'm care how much you try to simulate it.

233
00:15:23.58 --> 00:15:28.06
If there's no war going on you can't simulate it well enough and that's kind of the situation

234
00:15:28.06 --> 00:15:29.06
that they were in.

235
00:15:29.06 --> 00:15:35.30
Guys hadn't even some of the guys had never even shot a rifle before.

236
00:15:35.30 --> 00:15:39.94
This doesn't take long to escalate at all back to the book.

237
00:15:39.94 --> 00:15:44.82
At night we all retired to our tents early because the total blackout was in effect.

238
00:15:44.82 --> 00:15:48.02
It really made no difference to us because we had no lights in the tents anyways.

239
00:15:48.02 --> 00:15:53.46
All of a sudden around midnight or so there was a loud whistling and everyone outside.

240
00:15:53.46 --> 00:15:56.62
Loud whistling on the outside by our first sergeant.

241
00:15:56.62 --> 00:16:01.18
The whistling followed by shots of everyone up everyone up air raid.

242
00:16:01.18 --> 00:16:04.98
We could hear air raid sirens in the background so we were sure it was the real thing.

243
00:16:04.98 --> 00:16:08.42
A lot of guys were up and dressed in out and minutes but a lot of guys were slow and

244
00:16:08.42 --> 00:16:11.94
lagging around they figured it was a dry run so why hurry.

245
00:16:11.94 --> 00:16:14.66
Once out of the tents we were told to go to the edge of the jungle nearby and get away

246
00:16:14.66 --> 00:16:19.66
from our tents because they were undoubtedly become a great target for the enemy.

247
00:16:19.66 --> 00:16:24.74
Everyone did as he was told but before long there was grumbling and people wanted to go

248
00:16:24.74 --> 00:16:26.82
back to bed.

249
00:16:26.82 --> 00:16:32.26
Eventually we were given the order to return to our tents and needless to say we were ready.

250
00:16:32.26 --> 00:16:35.74
Once back in the dark tents we got out of our clothes and before long everyone was

251
00:16:35.74 --> 00:16:37.14
sound asleep again.

252
00:16:37.14 --> 00:16:42.10
I'm not sure how long we were asleep but sometime later that night we were awakened by horrendous

253
00:16:42.10 --> 00:16:45.62
sounds but likes of which we had never heard before.

254
00:16:45.62 --> 00:16:50.82
Great explosions were going on all around us and the ground was shaking as if an earthquake

255
00:16:50.82 --> 00:16:52.34
was taking place.

256
00:16:52.34 --> 00:16:56.74
Brilliant flashes of light could be seen through the thick canvas of our tents.

257
00:16:56.74 --> 00:17:01.18
By now our first sergeant was out again yelling for all the head for the jungle again.

258
00:17:01.18 --> 00:17:03.42
This time there were no stragglers.

259
00:17:03.42 --> 00:17:07.74
A lot of the guys just took off and they're underwear, some pants no shirt, some shirt

260
00:17:07.74 --> 00:17:08.74
but no pants.

261
00:17:08.74 --> 00:17:13.50
I managed to get clothes on and untied shoes before leaving our tent but once outside

262
00:17:13.50 --> 00:17:16.78
I was stunned for a while by what I heard and saw.

263
00:17:16.78 --> 00:17:22.58
The sky was filled with bursting anti-aircraft fire and tracer bullets could be seen, headed

264
00:17:22.58 --> 00:17:24.94
up in all directions.

265
00:17:24.94 --> 00:17:29.58
The sound of straining aircraft could also be heard intermingled with the rumbling sound

266
00:17:29.58 --> 00:17:35.70
of exploding bombs it looked like the world was coming to an end.

267
00:17:35.70 --> 00:17:40.10
So that's two days to go from hey we're going to a movie and we're hanging out in the

268
00:17:40.10 --> 00:17:43.74
Philippines drinking some beers to this.

269
00:17:43.74 --> 00:17:48.34
That's completely insane to think about.

270
00:17:48.34 --> 00:17:54.54
War had now come to us with a bang and it was real.

271
00:17:54.54 --> 00:17:57.10
Again fast-forwarding.

272
00:17:57.10 --> 00:18:00.34
And we received word to pull out of leap which is where they were the reason given

273
00:18:00.34 --> 00:18:04.74
was that the Japanese had landed a few miles from us and if we did knock it out of there

274
00:18:04.74 --> 00:18:06.26
in a hurry we might be overrun.

275
00:18:06.26 --> 00:18:08.26
So think about that.

276
00:18:08.26 --> 00:18:13.54
You know here you are, you're American, you got the strongest military, you come from

277
00:18:13.54 --> 00:18:19.26
this giant country and all of a sudden the Japanese who you weren't even at war with

278
00:18:19.26 --> 00:18:23.50
five days ago, four days ago, now they're landing on beach and you're under the threat

279
00:18:23.50 --> 00:18:24.86
of being overrun.

280
00:18:24.86 --> 00:18:32.18
And I look back now and think that the real story was that the Japs landed in force

281
00:18:32.18 --> 00:18:37.42
and they are commanders wanted all of us evacuated to the Baton Peninsula as quickly

282
00:18:37.42 --> 00:18:38.70
as possible.

283
00:18:38.70 --> 00:18:45.22
So they move, they march, they end up in Baton, they no longer have tents and they're

284
00:18:45.22 --> 00:18:51.18
living basically outside in little shelters that they're building and they are starting

285
00:18:51.18 --> 00:18:55.58
to get bombed all the time, here we go, back to the book, bombs frighten the devil out

286
00:18:55.58 --> 00:18:56.58
of me.

287
00:18:56.58 --> 00:19:00.42
I figured there was no way I could survive so many clothes calls day after day.

288
00:19:00.42 --> 00:19:05.26
There was many, there was many a day when bombs fell within 20 or 30 feet of me and

289
00:19:05.26 --> 00:19:07.50
eventually so much closer.

290
00:19:07.50 --> 00:19:12.62
If it had not been forced strategically located foxholes, I know I would not be here

291
00:19:12.62 --> 00:19:13.62
today.

292
00:19:13.62 --> 00:19:20.06
So these guys are getting just crushed because I didn't mention this part but you remember

293
00:19:20.06 --> 00:19:24.02
when he said when they left Polar Harbor they saw the ships with their planes on them,

294
00:19:24.02 --> 00:19:26.74
the planes never showed up, they got bombed and Pearl Harbor.

295
00:19:26.74 --> 00:19:31.82
So they had just a few planes that had already been there in the Philippines, they didn't

296
00:19:31.82 --> 00:19:34.14
have an actual war load out of planes.

297
00:19:34.14 --> 00:19:38.50
So the Japanese had total air superiority and that's why they were able to just bomb

298
00:19:38.50 --> 00:19:44.38
them with complete unrestricted violence.

299
00:19:44.38 --> 00:19:47.98
Back to the book, during a bombing raid I would normally peep over the edge of my foxhole

300
00:19:47.98 --> 00:19:50.82
to see where the planes were.

301
00:19:50.82 --> 00:19:54.98
At first all you knew was that they were headed in your direction and you had better

302
00:19:54.98 --> 00:19:57.14
stay put.

303
00:19:57.14 --> 00:20:02.42
As they got closer and closer you could tell better if they were going to pass to the

304
00:20:02.42 --> 00:20:05.74
side of you or if they were coming directly over.

305
00:20:05.74 --> 00:20:10.90
You remember the book we read where it builds up with the heavies coming?

306
00:20:10.90 --> 00:20:15.86
They the big slow war, it's Ernie Pile and he's talking about how the big slow war

307
00:20:15.86 --> 00:20:21.82
is coming and he looks up and he sees it's the heavies and how the guys were just so happy

308
00:20:21.82 --> 00:20:23.98
that the bombers were coming.

309
00:20:23.98 --> 00:20:28.74
The big allied American bombers were coming to give them support.

310
00:20:28.74 --> 00:20:31.22
Well this is the opposite.

311
00:20:31.22 --> 00:20:35.30
This is what it's like to be on the ground and the heavies are coming.

312
00:20:35.30 --> 00:20:36.62
The Japanese bombers are coming.

313
00:20:36.62 --> 00:20:38.66
Here we go back to the book.

314
00:20:38.66 --> 00:20:44.10
If they were directly overhead you began to sweat because that meant you were about to take

315
00:20:44.10 --> 00:20:45.94
a pounding.

316
00:20:45.94 --> 00:20:51.82
As you watch the planes you could all of a sudden see many small flashes of silver appear

317
00:20:51.82 --> 00:20:54.26
just below the planes.

318
00:20:54.26 --> 00:20:59.94
This meant that their bombs had been dropped and they were on their way down.

319
00:20:59.94 --> 00:21:05.54
These silver flashes were only visible for a few seconds then disappeared.

320
00:21:05.54 --> 00:21:11.14
If you were still looking up the next thing you saw and now heard where these large black

321
00:21:11.14 --> 00:21:16.74
objects coming at you with a terrible hissing sound.

322
00:21:16.74 --> 00:21:21.90
In a fraction of a second they were exploding with a terrific bang as they hit the ground.

323
00:21:21.90 --> 00:21:26.02
They did not go off simultaneously but one at a time until they had all exploded.

324
00:21:26.02 --> 00:21:30.86
If the bombs were just in front of you you could hear them getting closer and closer and

325
00:21:30.86 --> 00:21:32.74
that was the scary part.

326
00:21:32.74 --> 00:21:37.54
It wasn't until you could hear the explosives go past you that you knew you were safe and

327
00:21:37.54 --> 00:21:42.82
you could now relax that's when you thanked God for foxholes.

328
00:21:42.82 --> 00:21:47.06
We've talked about similar before with people being in the trenches in World War I.

329
00:21:47.06 --> 00:21:52.10
I think it was Bobby Hoffman or Bob Hoffman that was talking about in his book I remember

330
00:21:52.10 --> 00:21:58.34
the last war where when they would get mordered or hit with artillery that's how artillery

331
00:21:58.34 --> 00:21:59.34
works.

332
00:21:59.34 --> 00:22:02.10
You fire around then you move a little to the left then you fire around then you move a little

333
00:22:02.10 --> 00:22:06.42
to the left then you fire around and you move a little to the left and so you knew

334
00:22:06.42 --> 00:22:11.38
you could feel it's getting closer and closer and closer and until it goes by you

335
00:22:11.38 --> 00:22:15.86
you're waiting to get blown up you're waiting to die.

336
00:22:15.86 --> 00:22:19.54
That's exactly what he's talking about here.

337
00:22:19.54 --> 00:22:23.30
Back to the book besides bombs and enemy strafing there was another danger coming from

338
00:22:23.30 --> 00:22:24.30
the air.

339
00:22:24.30 --> 00:22:29.46
It was the hot whistling metal fragments raining down on us from our own anti aircraft

340
00:22:29.46 --> 00:22:31.06
guns at Corregador.

341
00:22:31.06 --> 00:22:36.82
So Corregador is not collocated with them and Corregador's firing anti aircraft and some

342
00:22:36.82 --> 00:22:44.14
of the fragments from all that fire is raining down on these guys.

343
00:22:44.14 --> 00:22:48.42
It wasn't long before our food supply was practically gone and we had to scrounge around

344
00:22:48.42 --> 00:22:49.90
to find something to eat.

345
00:22:49.90 --> 00:22:54.26
We eventually ate all of our horses that belong to the cavalry and the mules that were

346
00:22:54.26 --> 00:22:56.82
used to pull their cannons.

347
00:22:56.82 --> 00:23:05.26
So they ran out of food very quickly.

348
00:23:05.26 --> 00:23:11.18
Although we were air core we were ultimately designated as infantry and carried on and fought

349
00:23:11.18 --> 00:23:13.06
as such.

350
00:23:13.06 --> 00:23:16.50
When the front lines were active we could always hear the roar of cannons being fired in

351
00:23:16.50 --> 00:23:19.42
the noise of the resulting explosions.

352
00:23:19.42 --> 00:23:23.70
Many a night I fell asleep listening to this noise and especially during the last few weeks

353
00:23:23.70 --> 00:23:26.14
and days of our struggle.

354
00:23:26.14 --> 00:23:32.06
And this noise getting closer and closer as the front lines fell back I never in my wildest

355
00:23:32.06 --> 00:23:36.54
dreams felt that we would be defeated.

356
00:23:36.54 --> 00:23:42.14
We were tired, hungry and in many cases sick but we were still ready to fight.

357
00:23:42.14 --> 00:23:45.82
So let me just break that down a little bit.

358
00:23:45.82 --> 00:23:49.62
There's infantry soldiers up that are closer to the enemy that are fighting and they

359
00:23:49.62 --> 00:23:54.46
can hear that fighting taking place and they're back and they're in their air field

360
00:23:54.46 --> 00:24:00.70
area trying to, well they're holding security but they're basically around an air field

361
00:24:00.70 --> 00:24:06.70
and the infantry soldiers in the army are further away to the front and they can hear

362
00:24:06.70 --> 00:24:11.74
day after day that front line is getting closer and closer and closer to where they are

363
00:24:11.74 --> 00:24:16.46
because the Japanese are pushing them back and back and back and back.

364
00:24:16.46 --> 00:24:17.46
And it ends up like this.

365
00:24:17.46 --> 00:24:18.46
This is scary.

366
00:24:18.46 --> 00:24:24.86
So back to the book one day, stray soldiers started appearing at our air strip and the surprise

367
00:24:24.86 --> 00:24:28.70
me because I had never seen this before and talking to them they said they had left the

368
00:24:28.70 --> 00:24:31.26
front line looking for food.

369
00:24:31.26 --> 00:24:35.78
They were being constantly bombarded by Japanese guns and no food was getting to them.

370
00:24:35.78 --> 00:24:39.22
It was either go out and look for food or starve to death.

371
00:24:39.22 --> 00:24:43.26
So now eventually the guys that were out fighting the Japanese front line now they're

372
00:24:43.26 --> 00:24:54.74
straggler starting to come back to the air field because they're starving.

373
00:24:54.74 --> 00:25:00.34
One day we got word to gas up the last p40s that we had three as I recall and get them

374
00:25:00.34 --> 00:25:02.34
ready for takeoff.

375
00:25:02.34 --> 00:25:06.10
We pulled them out of their hiding place in the jungle and down to the field where the pilots

376
00:25:06.10 --> 00:25:08.14
were waiting.

377
00:25:08.14 --> 00:25:12.34
Normally the pilots wanted to jump in and take off immediately before the japs saw them

378
00:25:12.34 --> 00:25:15.42
but this time it was different.

379
00:25:15.42 --> 00:25:19.10
They said they were leaving baton and going to a field on one of the islands to the

380
00:25:19.10 --> 00:25:23.58
south which was still in friendly hands.

381
00:25:23.58 --> 00:25:27.38
Before the pilot got in his plane he asked me in a friend of mine if we wanted to send

382
00:25:27.38 --> 00:25:29.38
a message home.

383
00:25:29.38 --> 00:25:33.82
We said yes because it was the first opportunity that we had had do so since leaving the

384
00:25:33.82 --> 00:25:34.82
states.

385
00:25:34.82 --> 00:25:40.50
He had a pencil and I wrote a short note letting everyone know at home that I was well.

386
00:25:40.50 --> 00:25:47.10
When the last of our planes left that was the beginning of the end.

387
00:25:47.10 --> 00:25:51.54
It may have been the same day or the day after we were heardly taken back into camp and

388
00:25:51.54 --> 00:25:56.70
told to pack up we were told only to bring the barricentials the clothes and shoes that

389
00:25:56.70 --> 00:25:59.78
we had on toothbrushes etc.

390
00:25:59.78 --> 00:26:02.22
Nothing else.

391
00:26:02.22 --> 00:26:05.38
So you know you're in a bad way when the planes are taken off and the guys say hey you

392
00:26:05.38 --> 00:26:10.46
want me to pass them that's your joke because we're not coming back.

393
00:26:10.46 --> 00:26:22.78
And then to get told to hey take just the clothes on your back basically we're leaving.

394
00:26:22.78 --> 00:26:26.78
By the time we fought finally pulled out it was getting dark the people that we got back

395
00:26:26.78 --> 00:26:32.54
from the field said that they could hear jab tanks coming up the road and where and they

396
00:26:32.54 --> 00:26:34.54
were near.

397
00:26:34.54 --> 00:26:39.26
For the last several days the word got much closer to us gunfire was almost constant and

398
00:26:39.26 --> 00:26:47.10
night you could see the flash of our cannons and hear the exploding shells of the enemy.

399
00:26:47.10 --> 00:26:51.42
It wasn't long before we could hear the drone of jab bombers coming from a distance.

400
00:26:51.42 --> 00:26:54.34
We looked up and sure enough they were headed our way.

401
00:26:54.34 --> 00:26:57.14
All of a sudden we could hear the swishing of falling bombs.

402
00:26:57.14 --> 00:27:01.42
They started exploding as they hit the ground and each explosion kept getting closer and

403
00:27:01.42 --> 00:27:04.94
closer working in our direction.

404
00:27:04.94 --> 00:27:09.34
I knew that we were in big trouble when I heard explosions getting louder and louder

405
00:27:09.34 --> 00:27:15.02
then almost immediately we were practically obliterated by an exploding bomb that missed

406
00:27:15.02 --> 00:27:17.90
us by a few feet.

407
00:27:17.90 --> 00:27:22.46
When the bomb went off it sent dirt and large rocks flying in the air and all directions

408
00:27:22.46 --> 00:27:27.02
and we were almost covered by falling debris.

409
00:27:27.02 --> 00:27:31.50
This bomb was actually closer to me than the other bomb that killed the engineer on our

410
00:27:31.50 --> 00:27:35.10
air strip and peppered my arm with strappin'le.

411
00:27:35.10 --> 00:27:39.90
You could reach out from our foxhole and practically touch the edge of the large crater

412
00:27:39.90 --> 00:27:46.02
that it made but none of us were seriously hurt.

413
00:27:46.02 --> 00:27:48.02
That's crazy.

414
00:27:48.02 --> 00:27:53.38
So you got giant bombs blowing up and you can touch the crater that it leaves and you're

415
00:27:53.38 --> 00:27:54.54
surviving.

416
00:27:54.54 --> 00:27:57.30
That's why you dig foxholes by the way.

417
00:27:57.30 --> 00:28:04.98
That's why you dig foxholes because they provide incredible amount of protection.

418
00:28:04.98 --> 00:28:08.26
That is when we decided we better go back and find our outfit.

419
00:28:08.26 --> 00:28:13.38
When we did find our outfit we were flabbergasted by the news.

420
00:28:13.38 --> 00:28:16.82
We were surrendering.

421
00:28:16.82 --> 00:28:19.26
I could not believe it.

422
00:28:19.26 --> 00:28:23.94
All these men still with arms and now under the protection of caragador's big guns we

423
00:28:23.94 --> 00:28:26.42
were giving up.

424
00:28:26.42 --> 00:28:28.30
But it was true.

425
00:28:28.30 --> 00:28:32.58
We were told to destroy all of our weapons and ammunition immediately in any way that we

426
00:28:32.58 --> 00:28:33.58
could.

427
00:28:33.58 --> 00:28:38.58
Most people were disassembling their rifles and pistols and throwing them into the bay so

428
00:28:38.58 --> 00:28:39.86
I did the same.

429
00:28:39.86 --> 00:28:42.50
It was the quickest way to get rid of them.

430
00:28:42.50 --> 00:28:47.54
I did not mind getting rid of my rifle but I hated to throw away my pistol.

431
00:28:47.54 --> 00:28:52.86
We were told by our leaders to stay put until the japs came in.

432
00:28:52.86 --> 00:28:57.18
When they did we would be taken to prisoner of war camps where we would sit out the rest

433
00:28:57.18 --> 00:28:59.62
of the war.

434
00:28:59.62 --> 00:29:05.10
I did not like this idea at all but you could tell a lot of the guys felt relieved.

435
00:29:05.10 --> 00:29:10.14
They were dirty, tired, hungry and it had enough of war.

436
00:29:10.14 --> 00:29:14.78
They felt now that they had survived and would soon be fed, sheltered and given some

437
00:29:14.78 --> 00:29:19.42
long, long-needed rest.

438
00:29:19.42 --> 00:29:28.50
We all did we know that we were headed for hell.

439
00:29:28.50 --> 00:29:34.14
He goes into some, the, the, the, you got to get this book and read the whole book because

440
00:29:34.14 --> 00:29:41.02
he goes into all the details of how this collapse kind of finalized back to the book.

441
00:29:41.02 --> 00:29:46.02
By the time we got back to the group, Japanese troops had arrived from the other direction.

442
00:29:46.02 --> 00:29:49.78
They were already lining people up to count us.

443
00:29:49.78 --> 00:29:54.78
Pretty soon a jap soldier came up to me, muttering something and at the same time, flapping

444
00:29:54.78 --> 00:29:56.06
his hand up and down.

445
00:29:56.06 --> 00:30:01.46
I looked at him with a puzzle look because I didn't have the slightest idea what he wanted.

446
00:30:01.46 --> 00:30:07.34
The jap kept his puzzling jap gestures and I could tell that he was getting more furious

447
00:30:07.34 --> 00:30:09.46
by the minute.

448
00:30:09.46 --> 00:30:12.68
I turned around, looked at some of the guys and shrugged my shoulders indicating that

449
00:30:12.68 --> 00:30:15.98
I did not know what the jap wanted.

450
00:30:15.98 --> 00:30:18.22
Someone said he wants you to sit down.

451
00:30:18.22 --> 00:30:23.58
So I sit, so I sat down immediately and received a cross, a crack across my head with a

452
00:30:23.58 --> 00:30:27.78
rifle but I knew then that that was not what he wanted.

453
00:30:27.78 --> 00:30:30.54
So I immediately got back up.

454
00:30:30.54 --> 00:30:35.30
That's when he gave me a shove and the guy next to me a shove and so on.

455
00:30:35.30 --> 00:30:40.02
He wanted us to start walking.

456
00:30:40.02 --> 00:30:45.58
That was the beginning of our march out of baton and I believe that I was the first one

457
00:30:45.58 --> 00:30:49.62
to start it.

458
00:30:49.62 --> 00:30:53.42
This is where my story is going to be difficult to tell for two reasons.

459
00:30:53.42 --> 00:30:57.70
The first being that we were told on our return to the U.S. that we were not to speak to

460
00:30:57.70 --> 00:31:04.58
anyone about our experience as prisoners of war, not the press our family or friends.

461
00:31:04.58 --> 00:31:10.14
The reason for this was that somewhere down the line we might be in a war again and undoubtedly

462
00:31:10.14 --> 00:31:12.78
more prisoners would be taken.

463
00:31:12.78 --> 00:31:16.80
If we were to veiled how we survived this information would get into the hands of our

464
00:31:16.80 --> 00:31:22.10
enemy which would then make it doubly tough on our prisoners.

465
00:31:22.10 --> 00:31:25.70
This made good sense and I did abide by it.

466
00:31:25.70 --> 00:31:30.38
Over the years however our story has been told so many times now I feel free to tell

467
00:31:30.38 --> 00:31:32.38
mine.

468
00:31:32.38 --> 00:31:40.38
The second reason is that I was and still am reluctant to tell about my experiences

469
00:31:40.38 --> 00:31:48.26
of POW is the fact that I thought it would be impossible to describe what we went through.

470
00:31:48.26 --> 00:31:54.14
Impossible to tell and impossible to describe in written word.

471
00:31:54.14 --> 00:32:00.98
I have since read many good books on the subject and seen film documentaries made but you

472
00:32:00.98 --> 00:32:06.58
had to be there to experience it to know what it was like.

473
00:32:06.58 --> 00:32:16.42
I know that my meager attempt will also fail but I will write about it anyways.

474
00:32:16.42 --> 00:32:20.82
So now we're clearly now we're starting this horrific situation.

475
00:32:20.82 --> 00:32:27.18
This is the baton death march.

476
00:32:27.18 --> 00:32:32.14
As we marched along the road we soon soon found ourselves without hats and something far

477
00:32:32.14 --> 00:32:34.94
more critical water.

478
00:32:34.94 --> 00:32:39.26
The Japanese were quick to take our canteens and empty them on the road and knocked our

479
00:32:39.26 --> 00:32:42.78
steel helmets off with their rifle butts.

480
00:32:42.78 --> 00:32:46.50
We were marching through frontline troops that had just overpowered us.

481
00:32:46.50 --> 00:32:51.86
They were still inflicting punishment on us in any way that they could.

482
00:32:51.86 --> 00:32:57.46
We endured constant beatings, beatings, beatings every time we ran into a new group down

483
00:32:57.46 --> 00:32:59.46
the road.

484
00:32:59.46 --> 00:33:06.06
We ate us with rifles, sabers, sticks and anything else they could get their hands on.

485
00:33:06.06 --> 00:33:16.98
We were half starved and many so weak they could barely walk but they showed us no mercy.

486
00:33:16.98 --> 00:33:20.90
The day was torture.

487
00:33:20.90 --> 00:33:25.38
To begin with we did not know where we were going and we kept thinking surely it

488
00:33:25.38 --> 00:33:32.82
couldn't be much further but it was much, much further.

489
00:33:32.82 --> 00:33:38.46
The sun on our bare heads was bad but the worst was passing up water after water but

490
00:33:38.46 --> 00:33:41.78
not allowed any.

491
00:33:41.78 --> 00:33:47.38
After marching well into the dark that day we finally stopped completely beat and exhausted.

492
00:33:47.38 --> 00:33:52.70
We felt we would surely now be given food and water but that was not to be.

493
00:33:52.70 --> 00:33:57.14
They put us in a fenced off yard and told us through an interpreter that if any of us

494
00:33:57.14 --> 00:34:01.30
was found with a knife, razor blade or anything that could be used as a weapon he would

495
00:34:01.30 --> 00:34:04.94
be immediately shot.

496
00:34:04.94 --> 00:34:09.30
I thought to myself they did not say compass but I knew that I would be in big trouble if

497
00:34:09.30 --> 00:34:13.06
they found it so he had taken a compass and he's keeping that on him in case he ever

498
00:34:13.06 --> 00:34:15.34
gets the chance to escape.

499
00:34:15.34 --> 00:34:18.86
This place was extremely dark but there was enough light to see the Japanese soldiers

500
00:34:18.86 --> 00:34:21.74
with machine guns surrounding us.

501
00:34:21.74 --> 00:34:26.62
We were packed like sardines with barely enough room to stretch out and no latrine facilities.

502
00:34:26.62 --> 00:34:31.18
If you had to relieve yourself you did it where you were.

503
00:34:31.18 --> 00:34:37.42
I had now gone 48 hours without food and what liquid I had before starting the march was

504
00:34:37.42 --> 00:34:41.90
long gone by way of sweat.

505
00:34:41.90 --> 00:34:46.58
There was a lot of talking and moaning going on but it stopped immediately when we were told

506
00:34:46.58 --> 00:34:51.86
we would be shot if they heard any noises out of us again.

507
00:34:51.86 --> 00:35:00.18
Needless to say things quieted down and that is the last thing I remember that day.

508
00:35:00.18 --> 00:35:04.58
The next day we were started on the road again before dawn without food or water, same

509
00:35:04.58 --> 00:35:10.50
treatment by the troops heading into baton, beatings and more beatings.

510
00:35:10.50 --> 00:35:18.54
We were now plotting along leg zombies all we could think about was water.

511
00:35:18.54 --> 00:35:24.02
He talks about the fact that they are passing these little wells, these little pump and

512
00:35:24.02 --> 00:35:28.02
they can see that there is water they could clearly have and the Japanese are not allowing

513
00:35:28.02 --> 00:35:32.86
them to drink this water and that was the torture and is additional torture to what they

514
00:35:32.86 --> 00:35:36.06
were going through.

515
00:35:36.06 --> 00:35:37.06
Back to the book.

516
00:35:37.06 --> 00:35:41.10
I thought that we were now crossing was a total wreck the forest was literally destroyed.

517
00:35:41.10 --> 00:35:46.30
It looked like a forest fire had gone through it and all that was left was the skeleton

518
00:35:46.30 --> 00:35:49.98
of what was formerly giant trees.

519
00:35:49.98 --> 00:35:53.30
No remnants remained of what were once villages.

520
00:35:53.30 --> 00:35:57.86
The roadside was littered with burned out trucks and cars and an occasional tank could

521
00:35:57.86 --> 00:35:58.86
be seen.

522
00:35:58.86 --> 00:36:04.34
They looked like total destruction that it was.

523
00:36:04.34 --> 00:36:11.30
The worst part, however, was the dead bodies scattered all over.

524
00:36:11.30 --> 00:36:16.10
You could tell that they had been there for some time because they were all now black and

525
00:36:16.10 --> 00:36:18.46
bloated.

526
00:36:18.46 --> 00:36:24.86
The stench was horrible and the site was made more terrible by the swarm of flies around

527
00:36:24.86 --> 00:36:31.30
each body.

528
00:36:31.30 --> 00:36:37.76
Again, all day we staggered along that hot dusty road and that we passed running our

529
00:36:37.76 --> 00:36:42.34
disins wells from time to time we were not allowed to drink.

530
00:36:42.34 --> 00:36:44.54
We had long ago stopped thinking about food.

531
00:36:44.54 --> 00:36:46.42
Now it was water.

532
00:36:46.42 --> 00:36:47.62
Water.

533
00:36:47.62 --> 00:36:49.98
You kept thinking, where are they taking us?

534
00:36:49.98 --> 00:36:50.98
When will it end?

535
00:36:50.98 --> 00:36:55.26
You are thinking surely they know we are exhausted to the point of death and they would soon

536
00:36:55.26 --> 00:36:58.70
relent.

537
00:36:58.70 --> 00:37:00.66
But they did not.

538
00:37:00.66 --> 00:37:06.78
And we had to muster every bit of strength that we could carry on.

539
00:37:06.78 --> 00:37:11.66
Many of the sick and wounded had fallen out before now and the world knows how they were

540
00:37:11.66 --> 00:37:16.98
executed as they fell.

541
00:37:16.98 --> 00:37:22.06
I saw some of this but not nearly as much as the people bringing up the rear.

542
00:37:22.06 --> 00:37:26.82
I was fortunate in being near the front of the line and had this strength and fortitude

543
00:37:26.82 --> 00:37:30.94
to stay on my feet.

544
00:37:30.94 --> 00:37:34.50
All day we looked forward to the end of the heat and misery thinking that at night

545
00:37:34.50 --> 00:37:40.18
fall we would stop like we did the night before but this was not to be darkness came

546
00:37:40.18 --> 00:37:46.46
and we kept going.

547
00:37:46.46 --> 00:37:50.30
Long before now we had dumped any excess baggage that we were carrying.

548
00:37:50.30 --> 00:37:55.26
A lot of people started to march with blankets, mosquito nets, etc.

549
00:37:55.26 --> 00:37:59.14
And by the end of the first day this had all been discarded.

550
00:37:59.14 --> 00:38:02.86
There was hard enough carrying your own weight, much less anything additional.

551
00:38:02.86 --> 00:38:08.38
For the most part now we were plotting along with strangers.

552
00:38:08.38 --> 00:38:12.86
When we found out we were surrendering the squadron broke up and we were lucky if we ran

553
00:38:12.86 --> 00:38:15.82
into a buddy occasionally.

554
00:38:15.82 --> 00:38:21.54
Being together as a unit under such a trying situation would probably have helped but that

555
00:38:21.54 --> 00:38:29.98
did not happen.

556
00:38:29.98 --> 00:38:38.02
So this is just a nightmare getting worse by the moment and I didn't do a good job of explaining

557
00:38:38.02 --> 00:38:39.90
that going into this.

558
00:38:39.90 --> 00:38:44.02
It wasn't like they were well fed and well nourished going into this situation.

559
00:38:44.02 --> 00:38:47.30
They had already been under attack and they had not had food.

560
00:38:47.30 --> 00:38:49.22
They had run out of food very quickly.

561
00:38:49.22 --> 00:38:53.66
And these guys are already hungry and dehydrated when they started this thing and now

562
00:38:53.66 --> 00:38:57.38
it's just getting worse.

563
00:38:57.38 --> 00:39:05.42
I do think that the following took place shortly before dark on the third day.

564
00:39:05.42 --> 00:39:10.58
I was desperate for water even though I had some of the night before.

565
00:39:10.58 --> 00:39:14.94
By now many of the men were rushing every well that we came to even though they were

566
00:39:14.94 --> 00:39:16.98
being shot at as they did so.

567
00:39:16.98 --> 00:39:22.78
There were one or two guards close enough to do the shooting so if 10 or 12 men went

568
00:39:22.78 --> 00:39:31.38
at once the chances were six or eight would get back without being hit.

569
00:39:31.38 --> 00:39:36.66
I decided I would go for it but would wait until late evening.

570
00:39:36.66 --> 00:39:38.42
The opportunity finally arrived.

571
00:39:38.42 --> 00:39:44.26
I made a dash for it with about 10 or 12 others shots were fired but I got a gop of water

572
00:39:44.26 --> 00:39:53.78
without being hit.

573
00:39:53.78 --> 00:39:58.58
And this continues on and on.

574
00:39:58.58 --> 00:39:59.58
Word continued.

575
00:39:59.58 --> 00:40:03.86
Word quickly spread that we were finally going to be fed and given water.

576
00:40:03.86 --> 00:40:08.58
How that rumor got started I don't know but it did not happen.

577
00:40:08.58 --> 00:40:13.94
After a period of about 30 or 40 minutes they started marching us out on the road again.

578
00:40:13.94 --> 00:40:19.90
The gate that we went in was the opening between one of the houses and the high vine covered

579
00:40:19.90 --> 00:40:22.38
fence.

580
00:40:22.38 --> 00:40:26.54
As we approached this opening on our way out I noticed an army canteen sitting on a small

581
00:40:26.54 --> 00:40:28.46
ledge on the side of the house.

582
00:40:28.46 --> 00:40:31.82
My first reaction was that the canteen was a trap.

583
00:40:31.82 --> 00:40:35.94
You would grab it and the jab guards would shoot you for stealing.

584
00:40:35.94 --> 00:40:41.22
I thought to myself trap or no trap I am going to grab it which I did as I went by.

585
00:40:41.22 --> 00:40:47.22
It was in easy arms reach away and somewhat concealed by more ivory growing on the side

586
00:40:47.22 --> 00:40:49.26
of the house.

587
00:40:49.26 --> 00:40:53.86
Another miracle it was filled with water but I dared not drink it then.

588
00:40:53.86 --> 00:40:59.66
I had to wait until dark to make sure that a jab guard did not see me.

589
00:40:59.66 --> 00:41:05.62
It is unexpected happenings like this that helped us to survive.

590
00:41:05.62 --> 00:41:10.90
This is about the time that I started pulling out of it.

591
00:41:10.90 --> 00:41:17.46
By that I mean I no longer expected to stop just up the road to be fed and given water but

592
00:41:17.46 --> 00:41:25.90
now knew that the Japanese intended to march us until we all finally perished.

593
00:41:25.90 --> 00:41:37.50
To this day I still believe this to be true but I was not going to give them that satisfaction.

594
00:41:37.50 --> 00:41:44.10
So that is a hell of a mental transition to make from hey when are they going to stop

595
00:41:44.10 --> 00:41:46.82
when are they going to give us some food when are they going to give us some water to

596
00:41:46.82 --> 00:41:51.42
no they are not going to and they are going to march us until we die.

597
00:41:51.42 --> 00:41:58.02
And you know what I am not giving in.

598
00:41:58.02 --> 00:42:04.10
Fast forwarding a bit here the next day we reach the town of San Fernando where we finally

599
00:42:04.10 --> 00:42:08.26
stopped at least for the rest of that day and for that night.

600
00:42:08.26 --> 00:42:13.10
Here we were finally fed about a cup of a cup of boiled rice and allowed to have

601
00:42:13.10 --> 00:42:15.94
water.

602
00:42:15.94 --> 00:42:22.02
At this point many would have said that the rest was more important or appreciated than

603
00:42:22.02 --> 00:42:26.62
the food because many were suffering from incredibly blistered and bloody feet.

604
00:42:26.62 --> 00:42:31.42
My feet were badly blistered but not as bad as some who had put on new shoes when they

605
00:42:31.42 --> 00:42:34.70
were told to pack up and get ready to break camp.

606
00:42:34.70 --> 00:42:38.02
I had no new shoes otherwise I would have done the same.

607
00:42:38.02 --> 00:42:44.50
There is no way for a person to walk as far as we did without getting blistered feet.

608
00:42:44.50 --> 00:42:49.06
We spent the night at San Fernando and the next day took off again no breakfast of course

609
00:42:49.06 --> 00:42:52.90
but now at least I had a canteen full of water.

610
00:42:52.90 --> 00:42:58.42
By this time we were in an area where the Filipinos had returned to their barrios and

611
00:42:58.42 --> 00:43:01.62
Nippahuts bordering the road.

612
00:43:01.62 --> 00:43:05.34
Damaged property and terrain was not as bad as it was further to the south where more

613
00:43:05.34 --> 00:43:06.70
fighting had taken place.

614
00:43:06.70 --> 00:43:12.38
Now they are marching through regular Filipinos villages that weren't as decimated as

615
00:43:12.38 --> 00:43:15.38
the areas where they were fighting had taken place.

616
00:43:15.38 --> 00:43:20.18
There were Filipino men, women and children watching us as we weirdly walked along.

617
00:43:20.18 --> 00:43:27.62
By the way another thing I didn't explain very well the Filipino military men were also

618
00:43:27.62 --> 00:43:32.34
being marched simultaneously but they had them segregated.

619
00:43:32.34 --> 00:43:34.42
This is from the American viewpoint.

620
00:43:34.42 --> 00:43:39.94
They could see that the Filipinos were getting treated equally brutal and if not worse

621
00:43:39.94 --> 00:43:48.42
and they took massive casualties they took tens of thousands of deaths on this march.

622
00:43:48.42 --> 00:43:53.38
But now they are walking through where these regular Filipinos civilians are watching

623
00:43:53.38 --> 00:43:55.34
this death march take place.

624
00:43:55.34 --> 00:43:59.54
Back to the book in several places the women tried to hand food to us but the Japanese

625
00:43:59.54 --> 00:44:01.46
guards would not allow it.

626
00:44:01.46 --> 00:44:07.10
They had bananas, mangoes and coconuts and it all looked so good.

627
00:44:07.10 --> 00:44:12.14
I never saw it happen but supposedly several Filipinos lost their lives to Japanese bullets

628
00:44:12.14 --> 00:44:16.10
when they tried passing food to the Americans.

629
00:44:16.10 --> 00:44:20.30
This was the beginning of the end of the march out of baton but we did not know until

630
00:44:20.30 --> 00:44:30.22
sometime that afternoon when we arrived at Camp O'Donnell.

631
00:44:30.22 --> 00:44:34.82
So that kind of like you said this is the beginning of the end of the march and here they

632
00:44:34.82 --> 00:44:36.14
ended up at Camp O'Donnell.

633
00:44:36.14 --> 00:44:39.66
Camp O'Donnell was a training camp for the Philippine Army and was built just prior to the

634
00:44:39.66 --> 00:44:40.66
war.

635
00:44:40.66 --> 00:44:43.82
It consisted of a series of barracks built in typical Philippine style.

636
00:44:43.82 --> 00:44:48.86
The fats to roofs had bamboo frame sides and floors and openings for windows but no screens

637
00:44:48.86 --> 00:44:50.66
or shutters.

638
00:44:50.66 --> 00:44:55.14
Each barracks was about 50 feet long and could be called a double decker because the

639
00:44:55.14 --> 00:44:57.90
attic was floored as well.

640
00:44:57.90 --> 00:45:03.86
The attic space may have been for storing personal gear in instead of an area for sleeping.

641
00:45:03.86 --> 00:45:07.62
I say this because the highest point between the floor and the ceiling or the roof was about

642
00:45:07.62 --> 00:45:08.62
five feet.

643
00:45:08.62 --> 00:45:12.06
It would be cramped even for a short Filipino.

644
00:45:12.06 --> 00:45:16.90
I should know because that is where I slept.

645
00:45:16.90 --> 00:45:21.18
Once we passed through gate we were made to sit down and open field with a law was laid

646
00:45:21.18 --> 00:45:23.86
down by the Japanese commander.

647
00:45:23.86 --> 00:45:28.26
I did not pay much attention to what he said except if you were to say that if you did this

648
00:45:28.26 --> 00:45:32.10
you would be shot and if you did that you would be shot.

649
00:45:32.10 --> 00:45:36.74
I wondered what we could do without being shot.

650
00:45:36.74 --> 00:45:43.94
After he was through an American officer walked up and introduced himself as General King.

651
00:45:43.94 --> 00:45:48.86
He said that he was the General in charge of the troops on baton and he was solely responsible

652
00:45:48.86 --> 00:45:51.86
for our surrender.

653
00:45:51.86 --> 00:45:56.70
He told us not to feel bad or discouraged or guilty because we had nothing to do with it.

654
00:45:56.70 --> 00:45:59.06
It was his decision.

655
00:45:59.06 --> 00:46:04.18
And if any blame was to eventually come it was his to face.

656
00:46:04.18 --> 00:46:09.54
That's a ownership right there.

657
00:46:09.54 --> 00:46:14.10
I had never heard of the General before but he struck me as a brave and sincere officer.

658
00:46:14.10 --> 00:46:16.46
Well there you go.

659
00:46:16.46 --> 00:46:18.46
That's what happens when you take ownership.

660
00:46:18.46 --> 00:46:21.90
People, the people in your chain of command look and think you're a brave and sincere officer.

661
00:46:21.90 --> 00:46:24.38
Imagine if he stood up and said we didn't get the support that we needed and now we're

662
00:46:24.38 --> 00:46:25.38
in this position.

663
00:46:25.38 --> 00:46:27.46
It's like no.

664
00:46:27.46 --> 00:46:31.50
I later learned that he surrendered the troops on baton without orders from General Wayne

665
00:46:31.50 --> 00:46:36.26
Wright and MacArthur when he realized that to continue fighting was useless considering the condition

666
00:46:36.26 --> 00:46:39.50
of the men under his command.

667
00:46:39.50 --> 00:46:43.70
He thought for sure that he would be court-marshilled when the war was over because his last

668
00:46:43.70 --> 00:46:49.98
orders from MacArthur were to attack the enemy and order which he chose to ignore.

669
00:46:49.98 --> 00:46:54.58
He knew that it meant sending hundreds more to their deaths something that he would not

670
00:46:54.58 --> 00:46:57.18
do.

671
00:46:57.18 --> 00:47:01.06
Needless to say he was not court-marshilled at the end of the war because everyone by then

672
00:47:01.06 --> 00:47:07.02
realized that he did the right thing.

673
00:47:07.02 --> 00:47:11.26
We were finally taken to a barracks and I decided the best place was up in the loft.

674
00:47:11.26 --> 00:47:14.14
I figured it would be the quietest and least disturbed.

675
00:47:14.14 --> 00:47:19.98
I took my only possession from around my neck, my mouset bag, placed on the floor and

676
00:47:19.98 --> 00:47:23.58
got some long-deserved rest.

677
00:47:23.58 --> 00:47:25.02
The day was about over.

678
00:47:25.02 --> 00:47:31.18
The mosquitoes swarmed around my head before I fell asleep but I did not have the energy

679
00:47:31.18 --> 00:47:36.86
to brush them off.

680
00:47:36.86 --> 00:47:51.82
Sometimes I think when I read these books about how pathetic I am and you know how much

681
00:47:51.82 --> 00:47:56.18
there's a mosquito in your room and it drives you crazy and you have to wake up and go

682
00:47:56.18 --> 00:48:01.50
kill it because you just can't deal with one mosquito that might bite you and hear you

683
00:48:01.50 --> 00:48:02.50
are.

684
00:48:02.50 --> 00:48:07.78
Have you ever been in a subtropical place that has mosquitoes?

685
00:48:07.78 --> 00:48:10.22
It can be crazy.

686
00:48:10.22 --> 00:48:11.22
It can be crazy.

687
00:48:11.22 --> 00:48:13.22
Do you have to sleep at the mosquito net there?

688
00:48:13.22 --> 00:48:14.22
In your house?

689
00:48:14.22 --> 00:48:18.66
No, not in the house but there are some places where they all have mosquito net.

690
00:48:18.66 --> 00:48:19.66
It depends on where you live.

691
00:48:19.66 --> 00:48:25.62
If you live more up in like a mountain, jungley place, yeah, mosquito net.

692
00:48:25.62 --> 00:48:26.62
Sometimes.

693
00:48:26.62 --> 00:48:32.86
I've been in places where you've got to sleep in a mosquito net and even imagine you think

694
00:48:32.86 --> 00:48:36.30
you're some all-well, this would be a nightmare if I didn't have a mosquito net and these

695
00:48:36.30 --> 00:48:38.86
guys are they don't have anything close to mosquito.

696
00:48:38.86 --> 00:48:39.86
They don't have sheets.

697
00:48:39.86 --> 00:48:42.46
They have nothing to cover themselves from being bitten.

698
00:48:42.46 --> 00:48:48.74
So you think about these little tiny things that are like a major trauma when you're in

699
00:48:48.74 --> 00:48:50.62
your normal life.

700
00:48:50.62 --> 00:48:53.18
It's a major trauma.

701
00:48:53.18 --> 00:48:57.34
I can't believe there's mosquitoes out right now.

702
00:48:57.34 --> 00:49:01.42
What's fun is you still, you mentioned the mosquitoes are still kind of bothering me right

703
00:49:01.42 --> 00:49:02.42
now.

704
00:49:02.42 --> 00:49:04.30
The thought of mosquitoes being in the room now.

705
00:49:04.30 --> 00:49:07.10
Yeah, it's kind of like we're sitting here letting it bother and they don't imagine

706
00:49:07.10 --> 00:49:08.70
the situation these guys are in.

707
00:49:08.70 --> 00:49:11.30
And he's like, there's no cares about mosquitoes.

708
00:49:11.30 --> 00:49:12.90
Yeah, he's not even brushing them off.

709
00:49:12.90 --> 00:49:14.70
He's trying to brush them off.

710
00:49:14.70 --> 00:49:15.70
Man.

711
00:49:15.70 --> 00:49:17.50
Yeah, that's the way.

712
00:49:17.50 --> 00:49:18.50
Back to the book.

713
00:49:18.50 --> 00:49:22.46
We were now being fed a meager amount of rites but water situation was still critical.

714
00:49:22.46 --> 00:49:26.94
There was one very slow running faucet out in the yard with a flow capacity of about

715
00:49:26.94 --> 00:49:29.58
a quart every 15 minutes or so.

716
00:49:29.58 --> 00:49:33.18
The faucet was wide open and that is still all it would deliver.

717
00:49:33.18 --> 00:49:39.02
So even now, if and when we got water, it had to be stringently conserved.

718
00:49:39.02 --> 00:49:43.82
There was a line at the faucet always 24 hours a day.

719
00:49:43.82 --> 00:49:46.74
Barely enough water to drink and definitely not enough to wash with.

720
00:49:46.74 --> 00:49:54.06
It had now been a week since we broke camp on baton and we had not been able to wash since

721
00:49:54.06 --> 00:49:58.10
from here on, I won't be able to recount what happened on a day to day basis.

722
00:49:58.10 --> 00:50:02.02
But I will try to tell what was going on under and under what conditions.

723
00:50:02.02 --> 00:50:06.82
As I mentioned earlier, we were now getting a small amount of rice each day and for a

724
00:50:06.82 --> 00:50:10.78
change in men you started getting vegetables.

725
00:50:10.78 --> 00:50:16.14
Not the part you would normally eat but the part that was normally discarded.

726
00:50:16.14 --> 00:50:18.66
We were first given boiled carrot tops.

727
00:50:18.66 --> 00:50:24.18
I presume the Japanese were eating the carrots and they generally generously gave us the

728
00:50:24.18 --> 00:50:26.18
tops.

729
00:50:26.18 --> 00:50:29.78
They may as well have kept them because they were inedible.

730
00:50:29.78 --> 00:50:31.06
They would not stay down.

731
00:50:31.06 --> 00:50:32.70
They were so horrible and strong.

732
00:50:32.70 --> 00:50:36.90
We would up chuck after a few swallows.

733
00:50:36.90 --> 00:50:43.38
By now there were many sick people around with dysentery, malaria and diptheria.

734
00:50:43.38 --> 00:50:48.70
We conceivable disease was surfacing because of the physical condition of the men and the unhealthy

735
00:50:48.70 --> 00:50:52.38
conditions under which they were living.

736
00:50:52.38 --> 00:50:56.90
The sick were in such bad shape that they no longer stayed in the barracks but remained

737
00:50:56.90 --> 00:51:02.54
outside, some under the building to stay out of the sun and some lying outside on the ground

738
00:51:02.54 --> 00:51:05.78
near the slit trenches.

739
00:51:05.78 --> 00:51:11.26
Their clothes were all covered with excrement and some had discarded their clothes, preferring

740
00:51:11.26 --> 00:51:13.98
to be naked.

741
00:51:13.98 --> 00:51:21.42
These men had dysentery and to die of dysentery was the most horrible way to go.

742
00:51:21.42 --> 00:51:26.26
They had to stay outside or near the latrines because with dysentery you pass blood and

743
00:51:26.26 --> 00:51:30.86
mucus every 20 minutes or so.

744
00:51:30.86 --> 00:51:34.26
There is no way to keep from it.

745
00:51:34.26 --> 00:51:39.42
I know these men would have preferred dying, fighting instead of in a horrible way that they

746
00:51:39.42 --> 00:51:42.42
were now going.

747
00:51:42.42 --> 00:51:48.86
Dysentery almost invariably meant death.

748
00:51:48.86 --> 00:51:54.22
I think I mentioned that my best friend had drunk polluted water and it come down with dysentery.

749
00:51:54.22 --> 00:51:57.66
Well I now had the initial symptoms even though I did not drink.

750
00:51:57.66 --> 00:52:03.54
I was lucky if you want to call catching dysentery lucky in that my symptoms were occurred

751
00:52:03.54 --> 00:52:05.98
a week or so after we reached O'Donnell.

752
00:52:05.98 --> 00:52:10.82
I was lucky because I found out that the leaves from the trees found on the prison grounds

753
00:52:10.82 --> 00:52:14.34
were a cure for dysentery.

754
00:52:14.34 --> 00:52:19.38
I was also lucky because there were still leaves to be found and I was able to get a good

755
00:52:19.38 --> 00:52:24.18
pocket full of them which I immediately consumed in a few days my symptoms disappeared

756
00:52:24.18 --> 00:52:29.10
and also in a few days the trees were stripped bare.

757
00:52:29.10 --> 00:52:33.74
Apparently word had gotten out around that the leaves were a medicine but there were

758
00:52:33.74 --> 00:52:37.46
not enough to go around.

759
00:52:37.46 --> 00:52:43.02
Dysentery spreads so rapidly because of the open latrines and the millions of flies around

760
00:52:43.02 --> 00:52:44.02
them.

761
00:52:44.02 --> 00:52:48.02
They were the same big green flies that we saw in the dead bodies as we walked out of

762
00:52:48.02 --> 00:52:50.02
baton.

763
00:52:50.02 --> 00:52:58.26
There were so many that the branches of small trees around were bent to the ground.

764
00:52:58.26 --> 00:53:03.02
Sick men were also covered especially those near the latrine because the latrine itself

765
00:53:03.02 --> 00:53:06.70
held the greatest number.

766
00:53:06.70 --> 00:53:15.38
It was no wonder under these conditions that so many of the prisoners died.

767
00:53:15.38 --> 00:53:20.02
Besides the flies the stench was something else that was always with us.

768
00:53:20.02 --> 00:53:25.78
It was everywhere inside outside on you and on everyone else that was no way to get away

769
00:53:25.78 --> 00:53:26.78
from it.

770
00:53:26.78 --> 00:53:31.86
It came with a dysentery and by now the dysentery was also causing the death of many

771
00:53:31.86 --> 00:53:33.14
many prisoners.

772
00:53:33.14 --> 00:53:36.86
They were dying by the hundreds.

773
00:53:36.86 --> 00:53:41.94
We heard that as many as 400 were dying each day.

774
00:53:41.94 --> 00:53:46.62
And I remember I looked around to try and determine how many of us were still alive.

775
00:53:46.62 --> 00:53:54.02
I estimated that the rate we were dying we would all be gone within a month or so.

776
00:53:54.02 --> 00:53:58.70
It reached a point where there were so many sick that I decided it was decided to put

777
00:53:58.70 --> 00:54:03.98
them in a separate section. It was called a hospital officially but the prisoners called

778
00:54:03.98 --> 00:54:08.22
it the zero ward.

779
00:54:08.22 --> 00:54:12.58
When you went there that was the beginning of the end.

780
00:54:12.58 --> 00:54:17.58
Most died within days.

781
00:54:17.58 --> 00:54:21.98
The dead were buried in mass graves of about 15 to 20 bodies in each.

782
00:54:21.98 --> 00:54:29.94
Each grave was about five or six feet wide, eight or ten feet long and about six or seven feet deep.

783
00:54:29.94 --> 00:54:35.38
About as soon as a grave was finished there were bodies to fill it.

784
00:54:35.38 --> 00:54:39.26
Every morning in detail was sent to the hospital to collect the dead and then take them

785
00:54:39.26 --> 00:54:43.18
out to the graves for burial.

786
00:54:43.18 --> 00:54:48.82
I was on this detail several times and it was gruesome.

787
00:54:48.82 --> 00:54:55.66
The dead that we picked up were all naked and we're nothing but skin and bones.

788
00:54:55.66 --> 00:55:03.94
Several of the dead were from my squadron and one I could only recognize from his teeth.

789
00:55:03.94 --> 00:55:10.98
Each body was carried by four men although now they weighed practically nothing.

790
00:55:10.98 --> 00:55:16.78
The dead were carried on wicker racks which at some time were probably used as a door

791
00:55:16.78 --> 00:55:21.90
or as a window shutter.

792
00:55:21.90 --> 00:55:28.46
When we reached the graves we just damped them in the open holes.

793
00:55:28.46 --> 00:55:35.30
You could hear the bones crack as bodies were dumped on bodies.

794
00:55:35.30 --> 00:55:39.30
This seemed like a terrible way to treat our dead bodies but since they had all died

795
00:55:39.30 --> 00:55:45.94
of dysentery it was wise to handle the bodies as little as possible.

796
00:55:45.94 --> 00:55:52.10
When the hole was full there was then covered with dirt but no prayer or religious service

797
00:55:52.10 --> 00:55:55.06
was given.

798
00:55:55.06 --> 00:56:00.14
Across the road from us the Filipinos were doing the same as we burying their dead by the

799
00:56:00.14 --> 00:56:03.38
hundreds.

800
00:56:03.38 --> 00:56:10.94
Diphthira was a big killer as was cerebral malaria and berry berry in the early part of our

801
00:56:10.94 --> 00:56:11.94
confinement.

802
00:56:11.94 --> 00:56:16.70
There were two kinds of berry berry wet and dry with the wet a person's hands and feet

803
00:56:16.70 --> 00:56:21.70
swelled enormously and if the swelling progressed up the legs and into the abdomen death

804
00:56:21.70 --> 00:56:23.90
resulted.

805
00:56:23.90 --> 00:56:29.18
With the dry form there was no swelling but a broad excruciating pain to the feet and hands

806
00:56:29.18 --> 00:56:31.58
with no lead up.

807
00:56:31.58 --> 00:56:38.30
As far as I know this type is not fatal I came down with the wet type.

808
00:56:38.30 --> 00:56:46.30
Another killer was hepatitis or yellow jaundice I caught it at prison camp.

809
00:56:46.30 --> 00:56:50.78
Next to dysentery hepatitis was probably the number two killer in the prison camps.

810
00:56:50.78 --> 00:56:54.90
It caused you to lose your appetite which is one thing you could not afford to do because

811
00:56:54.90 --> 00:57:05.66
the food that you were getting was barely enough to keep you alive as it was.

812
00:57:05.66 --> 00:57:13.74
This when you think of just again putting this in perspective you know when we get sick

813
00:57:13.74 --> 00:57:21.22
we take a day off from work and you stay in your bed or whatever and these guys there's

814
00:57:21.22 --> 00:57:23.98
no medical treatment whatsoever.

815
00:57:23.98 --> 00:57:32.42
There's nothing.

816
00:57:32.42 --> 00:57:39.42
But to now no one had escaped again I'm fast forwarding up to now no one had escaped

817
00:57:39.42 --> 00:57:42.14
but one night it happened.

818
00:57:42.14 --> 00:57:46.58
It should not be called to escape because these prisoners were caught trying to get back

819
00:57:46.58 --> 00:57:48.34
in the prison camp.

820
00:57:48.34 --> 00:57:52.02
There were three of them and they had been out looking for food or medicine.

821
00:57:52.02 --> 00:57:55.98
I remember they were putting a cage near the gate where the prisoners going and coming

822
00:57:55.98 --> 00:57:59.06
to and from work details could see them.

823
00:57:59.06 --> 00:58:05.30
The cages were in the hot sun and they were not given food or water.

824
00:58:05.30 --> 00:58:10.26
You could tell they were suffering miserably but they're suffering only lasted day or two

825
00:58:10.26 --> 00:58:19.42
as I recall because late one evening we were called out to witness their execution.

826
00:58:19.42 --> 00:58:28.98
They were made to dig their own graves and fell into them when shot.

827
00:58:28.98 --> 00:58:33.42
To these men were shot the Japanese came up with an idea that they thought would stop prisoners

828
00:58:33.42 --> 00:58:34.98
from trying to escape.

829
00:58:34.98 --> 00:58:42.06
They put us in what was called blood-brothered groups and if one of the group escaped or tried

830
00:58:42.06 --> 00:58:45.34
to escape the rest would be shot.

831
00:58:45.34 --> 00:59:02.46
He guard this of their complicity.

832
00:59:02.46 --> 00:59:07.74
Many of the men felt abandoned and decided that such an existence as ours was not worth

833
00:59:07.74 --> 00:59:13.90
the price of survival so they just gave up.

834
00:59:13.90 --> 00:59:26.30
And was it much easier than the fight to stay alive and many chose this way out?

835
00:59:26.30 --> 00:59:32.86
Now he gets assigned eventually to a bridge detail to build a bridge and this is kind

836
00:59:32.86 --> 00:59:35.26
of like the bridge on the Riverquite type scenario.

837
00:59:35.26 --> 00:59:39.90
You've got to go work and help build this bridge back to the book that worked was a short

838
00:59:39.90 --> 00:59:41.54
distance from our school.

839
00:59:41.54 --> 00:59:46.46
That's where they were being held and turned out to be the rebuilding of an enormous bridge

840
00:59:46.46 --> 00:59:49.62
that had been destroyed during the war.

841
00:59:49.62 --> 00:59:54.26
When we were not carrying and placing timber we were made to carry rocks from the Riverbed

842
00:59:54.26 --> 01:00:02.42
up to the bridge level a climb of probably 30 or 40 feet but it felt like scaling Mount Everest.

843
01:00:02.42 --> 01:00:11.50
This entry soon weakened our workforce and before long prisoners were again dying like flies.

844
01:00:11.50 --> 01:00:14.26
I could not help but notice one guy's foot.

845
01:00:14.26 --> 01:00:18.10
It looked like it was rotting away and I'm sure he had gang green.

846
01:00:18.10 --> 01:00:21.26
What impressed me about him was his attitude about his affliction.

847
01:00:21.26 --> 01:00:25.98
He seemed even jovial as we rode back to camp.

848
01:00:25.98 --> 01:00:31.50
I never saw him again but it was a miracle if he survived.

849
01:00:31.50 --> 01:00:35.82
According to a book written by one of the guys on this bridge detail only seven of us were

850
01:00:35.82 --> 01:00:39.78
alive at wars end.

851
01:00:39.78 --> 01:00:42.26
Another man had something terribly wrong with him.

852
01:00:42.26 --> 01:00:46.78
I was never sure what the problem was exactly but it involved his stomach and I don't

853
01:00:46.78 --> 01:00:50.98
know if it was a war wound or what.

854
01:00:50.98 --> 01:00:56.34
He wore a very wide rubber band around his stomach and I was told it was to keep his intestines

855
01:00:56.34 --> 01:00:58.78
in.

856
01:00:58.78 --> 01:01:04.10
The rubber band was cut from a large inner tube that slipped that he slipped into.

857
01:01:04.10 --> 01:01:09.06
I never did see his stomach beneath the rubber bandage but I did see a Japanese guard make

858
01:01:09.06 --> 01:01:17.62
him show it to him and the guards stepped back horrified.

859
01:01:17.62 --> 01:01:23.94
I doubt if this prisoner survived.

860
01:01:23.94 --> 01:01:29.34
They end up at a different prison camp called Kabanatuan.

861
01:01:29.34 --> 01:01:33.66
Kabanatuan prison camp was just like O'Donnell and it's hard for me to separate them

862
01:01:33.66 --> 01:01:34.66
in my mind.

863
01:01:34.66 --> 01:01:39.02
I have trouble separating the two prison camps because one was just as bad as the other

864
01:01:39.02 --> 01:01:44.70
little water and dirty filthy living conditions.

865
01:01:44.70 --> 01:01:49.86
Back to rice but now more soupy instead of dry people were still dying with dysentery

866
01:01:49.86 --> 01:01:51.18
and other diseases.

867
01:01:51.18 --> 01:01:56.38
I was still in my dirty clothes closed that had not been off my body since leaving our camp

868
01:01:56.38 --> 01:02:04.78
on baton.

869
01:02:04.78 --> 01:02:08.10
And now they're getting told that they're going to be transported back to the book.

870
01:02:08.10 --> 01:02:11.58
And we were told we were going to Japan the Japanese made it sound like we were going to

871
01:02:11.58 --> 01:02:12.58
heaven.

872
01:02:12.58 --> 01:02:16.78
We would be leaving this stifling tropical heat and going to a climate that was cool and

873
01:02:16.78 --> 01:02:18.78
comfortable.

874
01:02:18.78 --> 01:02:23.10
They get transported to Manila and eventually they get on a ship.

875
01:02:23.10 --> 01:02:27.18
The ship that we got on was large and apparently carried Japanese troops from place to

876
01:02:27.18 --> 01:02:28.18
place.

877
01:02:28.18 --> 01:02:31.18
I'm not sure how many prisoners boarded this ship but the number was very high.

878
01:02:31.18 --> 01:02:35.26
A later estimation put the number at 2000.

879
01:02:35.26 --> 01:02:41.94
We would end up like sardines except we were packed vertically instead of horizontally.

880
01:02:41.94 --> 01:02:45.26
It turned out lucky that I was to be on the floor because even though I could not lie

881
01:02:45.26 --> 01:02:48.34
down and stretch out I could at least sit and stand.

882
01:02:48.34 --> 01:02:52.78
People crowded in the sleeping bay is also did not have room to stretch out but they also

883
01:02:52.78 --> 01:02:57.02
did not have enough head space to stand up.

884
01:02:57.02 --> 01:03:00.90
By now the ship was getting unbearably hot from the heat of the tropical sun in the large

885
01:03:00.90 --> 01:03:05.46
number of prisoners in such a confined space added to it.

886
01:03:05.46 --> 01:03:14.42
It was quickly turning into agony but we had not seen the worst because many of the prisoners

887
01:03:14.42 --> 01:03:16.70
were still coming down with this entry.

888
01:03:16.70 --> 01:03:19.90
Toilet facilities soon became a problem.

889
01:03:19.90 --> 01:03:25.66
All we had was a bucket on top side and the Japanese guards would only let about two people

890
01:03:25.66 --> 01:03:28.50
out at a time.

891
01:03:28.50 --> 01:03:34.18
It wasn't long before we were crowded at the latter wanting to use the so-called facility.

892
01:03:34.18 --> 01:03:41.94
It also wasn't long before the place became a stinking cesspool.

893
01:03:41.94 --> 01:03:45.74
People soiled their clothes and everyone and everything around them.

894
01:03:45.74 --> 01:03:50.22
If anything it was worse than Campo Donald because now everyone was confined in a small

895
01:03:50.22 --> 01:03:56.46
overcrowded space and you just could not get away from it.

896
01:03:56.46 --> 01:04:01.54
Even drinking water was also just as bad because it was also topside and you got it

897
01:04:01.54 --> 01:04:06.38
when you went to the little train.

898
01:04:06.38 --> 01:04:12.34
As expected under such conditions people began to die.

899
01:04:12.34 --> 01:04:16.90
At first it was maybe one or two a day and some days none but eventually it got up to several

900
01:04:16.90 --> 01:04:21.02
a day, most of the dying occurred at night for some reason.

901
01:04:21.02 --> 01:04:26.90
In the morning they were passed up to the Japanese to be thrown overboard.

902
01:04:26.90 --> 01:04:31.86
Nights were probably more stressful because the whole that we occupied was in total darkness.

903
01:04:31.86 --> 01:04:42.18
You could not see a thing but you could hear the constant moaning of men in agony.

904
01:04:42.18 --> 01:04:45.90
One night all bedlam broke loose.

905
01:04:45.90 --> 01:04:50.98
There was loud screaming and thrashing of disturbed bodies which caused a considerable

906
01:04:50.98 --> 01:04:53.62
uproar.

907
01:04:53.62 --> 01:04:57.18
In the dark you could tell that many people were involved even though they could not be

908
01:04:57.18 --> 01:05:00.30
seen.

909
01:05:00.30 --> 01:05:02.42
Next morning we found out what happened.

910
01:05:02.42 --> 01:05:08.66
One of the prisoners had gone mad and started attacking everyone around him with his

911
01:05:08.66 --> 01:05:11.02
canteen.

912
01:05:11.02 --> 01:05:18.98
When he severely hurt several around him it was obvious that he could not be restrained.

913
01:05:18.98 --> 01:05:25.34
He was killed by those around him with his own canteen.

914
01:05:25.34 --> 01:05:34.06
Next morning he was lifted out of the hole with several others and slipped overboard.

915
01:05:34.06 --> 01:05:41.90
His troubles were over.

916
01:05:41.90 --> 01:05:52.70
So I don't know what is much worse than this situation that we're in right now.

917
01:05:52.70 --> 01:06:00.78
When you have guys going crazy and the only choice that you're left as a fellow soldier is

918
01:06:00.78 --> 01:06:08.26
to kill your fellow soldier to prevent him from hurting anyone else.

919
01:06:08.26 --> 01:06:12.78
Eventually after about three or four weeks we came to a complete stop we could hear voices

920
01:06:12.78 --> 01:06:17.14
on the outside of the ship as our ship was tied up.

921
01:06:17.14 --> 01:06:22.78
We soon learned that we were in a Taiwan harbor.

922
01:06:22.78 --> 01:06:27.26
Now that we were back out in the open and breathing again fresh air felt like we had

923
01:06:27.26 --> 01:06:36.02
a collision from the dead so they get off the ship and they end up there.

924
01:06:36.02 --> 01:06:41.54
Obviously they're literally covered in shit and you know when he talked about people

925
01:06:41.54 --> 01:06:49.30
with dysentery you're you're you're relieving yourself and you're shedding out blood

926
01:06:49.30 --> 01:06:56.06
and mucus and that's what they're just covered in.

927
01:06:56.06 --> 01:07:00.22
I don't know if this was their original intention but after they saw how dirty and filthy

928
01:07:00.22 --> 01:07:04.86
would they we were they decided to clean us up as well as the ship they made a strip

929
01:07:04.86 --> 01:07:08.62
completely and then blasted us with water from fire hoses.

930
01:07:08.62 --> 01:07:11.26
The force of the water hurt and stung but it felt good.

931
01:07:11.26 --> 01:07:14.14
We had no soap but that was all right.

932
01:07:14.14 --> 01:07:21.82
This was the first water I'd had on my body since we left our bibwack on baton.

933
01:07:21.82 --> 01:07:26.10
We were also stomping on our wet clothes to hope to work out some of the dirt and crud

934
01:07:26.10 --> 01:07:30.30
as well as that on our own bodies.

935
01:07:30.30 --> 01:07:35.10
While this was going on there was a crowd of Taiwanese onlookers taking all this in.

936
01:07:35.10 --> 01:07:36.82
There were both men and women.

937
01:07:36.82 --> 01:07:42.10
It was about now that I noticed my own body.

938
01:07:42.10 --> 01:07:46.30
I was shocked and horrified by what I saw.

939
01:07:46.30 --> 01:07:52.38
It was not the dirty body as such but the physical condition of that body.

940
01:07:52.38 --> 01:07:56.34
I had dwindled to skin and bones and had not been aware of it.

941
01:07:56.34 --> 01:08:01.26
My legs and arms were completely devoid of muscle and flesh and I looked like a living

942
01:08:01.26 --> 01:08:04.42
skeleton.

943
01:08:04.42 --> 01:08:07.26
I was the skinny as the men who had died of dysentery.

944
01:08:07.26 --> 01:08:12.18
It really shook me to discover this.

945
01:08:12.18 --> 01:08:17.42
And if you go on the internet, you can see pictures of guys that were involved in this

946
01:08:17.42 --> 01:08:21.10
and they look absolutely wretched.

947
01:08:21.10 --> 01:08:22.86
They actually look.

948
01:08:22.86 --> 01:08:25.74
Some of them look exactly how he describes it as.

949
01:08:25.74 --> 01:08:27.54
They look like living skeletons.

950
01:08:27.54 --> 01:08:34.26
That's how much how completely mownerished they were.

951
01:08:34.26 --> 01:08:38.38
Back to the book when we finally did get back on the ship.

952
01:08:38.38 --> 01:08:42.14
We found our so-called quarter still dripping wet and now very cold.

953
01:08:42.14 --> 01:08:46.54
Even after we were all back in, it did not feel warm.

954
01:08:46.54 --> 01:08:50.38
By now because the number of prisoners that had died, there was a little more space for

955
01:08:50.38 --> 01:08:52.70
everyone.

956
01:08:52.70 --> 01:08:57.46
I remember the one guy who had a bunk position now had enough room to lie down.

957
01:08:57.46 --> 01:09:00.86
He was even kind enough to give me his space from time to time to stretch out and take

958
01:09:00.86 --> 01:09:01.86
a nap.

959
01:09:01.86 --> 01:09:05.74
It was funny because we never did learn each other's names.

960
01:09:05.74 --> 01:09:08.58
I think it was the best way.

961
01:09:08.58 --> 01:09:13.02
Because if the person died, you would not take it so hard.

962
01:09:13.02 --> 01:09:16.90
Just another stranger gone.

963
01:09:16.90 --> 01:09:21.30
So they go out and see again.

964
01:09:21.30 --> 01:09:23.02
And then they pull into another port.

965
01:09:23.02 --> 01:09:26.34
Finally after many days, I felt the ship's low and come to a halt.

966
01:09:26.34 --> 01:09:30.78
I thought Japan at last and now I might get medical help and medicine for my sickness

967
01:09:30.78 --> 01:09:31.78
and pain.

968
01:09:31.78 --> 01:09:36.18
Before long, prisoners were crawling up the ladder out of a hole until the place was

969
01:09:36.18 --> 01:09:38.18
almost empty.

970
01:09:38.18 --> 01:09:41.66
My mousse set bag around my neck and my cantine in it.

971
01:09:41.66 --> 01:09:45.66
I made an attempt to cross over to the ladder, but that was not to be.

972
01:09:45.66 --> 01:09:49.90
I could not even raise rise much less walk.

973
01:09:49.90 --> 01:09:53.94
Pretty soon two Japanese soldiers came down into the hole and sort of lifting the second

974
01:09:53.94 --> 01:09:57.10
dying to the other Japanese above.

975
01:09:57.10 --> 01:10:01.14
I was not the only one unable to move.

976
01:10:01.14 --> 01:10:04.98
When they came to get me, they lifted me to my feet and drug me over to the ladder.

977
01:10:04.98 --> 01:10:09.22
They wanted me to crawl up and out, but that was impossible.

978
01:10:09.22 --> 01:10:12.94
I was too weak and I hurt too much.

979
01:10:12.94 --> 01:10:17.50
When they saw I could not do it each Japanese guard, grabbing by the arms, lifted my arms

980
01:10:17.50 --> 01:10:20.74
above my head, then handed me to waiting guards above.

981
01:10:20.74 --> 01:10:26.82
The jab guards above grabbing by my wrists and lifted me out.

982
01:10:26.82 --> 01:10:29.62
How I survived this ordeal, I shall never know.

983
01:10:29.62 --> 01:10:36.30
The pain that I felt when being lifted by the arms was excruciating.

984
01:10:36.30 --> 01:10:46.26
I had never felt anything like it before nor have I felt anything come close since.

985
01:10:46.26 --> 01:10:50.38
So I mean he just can't even stand up.

986
01:10:50.38 --> 01:10:56.26
He's just completely broken and starving and they have to drag him out of there luckily

987
01:10:56.26 --> 01:10:59.74
they didn't kill him. They load him onto a truck back to the book. The truck ride that

988
01:10:59.74 --> 01:11:01.94
followed was no joyful experience either.

989
01:11:01.94 --> 01:11:05.90
Now my bones began to take a beating as I lay on the metal bed of the truck.

990
01:11:05.90 --> 01:11:09.94
I was being bounced around because of a very rough road and I had no flesh on my bones

991
01:11:09.94 --> 01:11:12.06
to cushion each bounce.

992
01:11:12.06 --> 01:11:17.74
Again, pain and misery when would it end?

993
01:11:17.74 --> 01:11:21.38
Finally we arrived at what appeared to be an army camp and the trucks drove up to one

994
01:11:21.38 --> 01:11:22.54
of the barracks.

995
01:11:22.54 --> 01:11:27.30
Once inside we found the place to be very clean and nice and warm. There was snow on the

996
01:11:27.30 --> 01:11:30.30
ground outside which accounted for the heat inside.

997
01:11:30.30 --> 01:11:36.30
There were even straw-filled mattresses and blankets for each man.

998
01:11:36.30 --> 01:11:41.54
We learned a little later that we were not in Japan but in a place called Pusan Korea.

999
01:11:41.54 --> 01:11:45.66
I'd never heard of it before.

1000
01:11:45.66 --> 01:11:50.30
So now they're obviously they're in Korea now and you can see the treatment gets a little

1001
01:11:50.30 --> 01:11:54.58
bit better. There's a little bit of influence from the Koreans trying to be a little bit

1002
01:11:54.58 --> 01:11:57.82
more humane I think.

1003
01:11:57.82 --> 01:12:02.14
All back to the book as all as in all the places I'd previously been people were

1004
01:12:02.14 --> 01:12:05.34
dying at the rate of two or three a day.

1005
01:12:05.34 --> 01:12:10.26
They were picked up in the morning when the doctor came in and taken out and cremated.

1006
01:12:10.26 --> 01:12:15.34
By then you could tell when a person was about to die.

1007
01:12:15.34 --> 01:12:18.38
They had what we called a death grin.

1008
01:12:18.38 --> 01:12:23.62
The skin was stretched so tightly across their fleshless faces that their mouth stayed permanently

1009
01:12:23.62 --> 01:12:27.42
open as though grinning.

1010
01:12:27.42 --> 01:12:31.86
A person in that condition was not long for this world.

1011
01:12:31.86 --> 01:12:34.74
There was another condition that we called the death rattle.

1012
01:12:34.74 --> 01:12:38.98
This also meant death within a few days.

1013
01:12:38.98 --> 01:12:42.90
I was shocked beyond belief one morning when the person next to me said that during the

1014
01:12:42.90 --> 01:12:48.26
night I was making the rattling sound.

1015
01:12:48.26 --> 01:12:54.66
After that I was afraid to go to sleep because that was usually when a person died.

1016
01:12:54.66 --> 01:12:57.74
I remember fighting to stay awake night after night.

1017
01:12:57.74 --> 01:13:02.10
The night seemed to last in eternity and I remembered how glad I was to hear the sound

1018
01:13:02.10 --> 01:13:03.62
of the crows in the distance.

1019
01:13:03.62 --> 01:13:08.58
It meant morning was near and I was still around.

1020
01:13:08.58 --> 01:13:15.78
You reach a point where dying becomes easy but staying alive is a battle.

1021
01:13:15.78 --> 01:13:21.46
Many chose not to fight any longer.

1022
01:13:21.46 --> 01:13:26.66
I would say that after two or three weeks the dying ceased.

1023
01:13:26.66 --> 01:13:31.66
There were about 20 or 25 of us left and we were slowly starting to get out of bed and

1024
01:13:31.66 --> 01:13:33.02
move around some.

1025
01:13:33.02 --> 01:13:39.74
So like I said there's starting to get a little bit more food a little bit better treatment.

1026
01:13:39.74 --> 01:13:43.30
One thing that I'm not sure of in my mind is when the Japanese finally gave us new clothes

1027
01:13:43.30 --> 01:13:44.50
and shoes to wear.

1028
01:13:44.50 --> 01:13:47.34
The clothes we were given were all Japanese Army issues.

1029
01:13:47.34 --> 01:13:51.18
Shoes, caps, shirt, pants, socks, underwear and coat.

1030
01:13:51.18 --> 01:13:55.62
These were Japanese summer uniforms and clothes and not willing uniforms that our guards

1031
01:13:55.62 --> 01:13:57.94
were now wearing.

1032
01:13:57.94 --> 01:14:06.02
We hated having to wear a Japanese uniform but we really had no choice.

1033
01:14:06.02 --> 01:14:14.38
So now they actually end up getting on a train and they go for a long train lot

1034
01:14:14.38 --> 01:14:21.10
ride and when they finally get off the place looked like and felt like the inside of a

1035
01:14:21.10 --> 01:14:29.58
deep freezer everything was covered with snow and frozen solid.

1036
01:14:29.58 --> 01:14:35.78
And then they get put into a truck after they get off the train in this frozen area

1037
01:14:35.78 --> 01:14:42.06
and they travel out from the train area, from the train station away from the city and

1038
01:14:42.06 --> 01:14:48.38
they keep going and they keep going and finally they get to a place that looks like a prison.

1039
01:14:48.38 --> 01:14:52.74
Back to the book I remember there were several buildings possibly a dozen or more but I am

1040
01:14:52.74 --> 01:14:57.18
not sure of the exact number.

1041
01:14:57.18 --> 01:15:00.78
The buildings were loaded the ground and barely visible because the thick blanket of snow

1042
01:15:00.78 --> 01:15:04.58
that covered everything we stopped shortly at one of the buildings and unloaded.

1043
01:15:04.58 --> 01:15:06.38
Again I needed assistance.

1044
01:15:06.38 --> 01:15:10.10
I wasn't in the building more than five minutes when one of the men said that my nose

1045
01:15:10.10 --> 01:15:16.82
was frozen or frostbitten and I had better quickly do something about it.

1046
01:15:16.82 --> 01:15:24.66
If I knew my frost my nose was frozen my feet surely were also both my nose and feet

1047
01:15:24.66 --> 01:15:29.22
blistered horribly and turned black and blue like a bad bruise.

1048
01:15:29.22 --> 01:15:33.54
The skin eventually peeled off and I was fine except for some badly scarred feet.

1049
01:15:33.54 --> 01:15:38.26
So I didn't go into enough detail but while they're transporting in these trucks it's

1050
01:15:38.26 --> 01:15:39.26
freezing.

1051
01:15:39.26 --> 01:15:42.46
And so you've got these guys that are in whatever summer uniforms and by the way they're

1052
01:15:42.46 --> 01:15:47.02
they're way nothing they have no they literally have zero body fat on them and they're

1053
01:15:47.02 --> 01:15:51.14
freezing in these trucks and he gets frostbite.

1054
01:15:51.14 --> 01:15:58.42
Back to the book we also found out that we were near the city of Mookden, Manchuria.

1055
01:15:58.42 --> 01:16:02.90
We had come from the furnace of the tropics into the deep freeze of the Arctic and if you

1056
01:16:02.90 --> 01:16:10.58
remember that name might sound a little bit familiar, Mookden, Manchuria that is one of the

1057
01:16:10.58 --> 01:16:20.78
locations where the Japanese the unit 731 did experiments on Caucasian.

1058
01:16:20.78 --> 01:16:25.38
They wanted to have Caucasian prisoners to do experiments on to make sure that the

1059
01:16:25.38 --> 01:16:32.26
reactions to biological and chemical weapons were the same as they were on the Asian

1060
01:16:32.26 --> 01:16:36.02
prisoners that they had been using on them on on the Chinese prisoners that they've

1061
01:16:36.02 --> 01:16:43.10
been using these these chemical weapons on and these biological weapons on and so that's

1062
01:16:43.10 --> 01:16:52.38
where he is now.

1063
01:16:52.38 --> 01:16:56.02
Settle in a little bit here before long it was lights out time.

1064
01:16:56.02 --> 01:16:58.14
I again became aware of how weak I was.

1065
01:16:58.14 --> 01:17:03.22
I tried to crawl under my blankets when I read this I was thinking about this.

1066
01:17:03.22 --> 01:17:04.74
So listen this.

1067
01:17:04.74 --> 01:17:09.74
I tried to crawl under my blankets but could not lift them.

1068
01:17:09.74 --> 01:17:12.86
Eventually with the help of others I managed to make it.

1069
01:17:12.86 --> 01:17:18.10
The covers felt good for a while but before long my body began to ache from the weight

1070
01:17:18.10 --> 01:17:20.82
of the covers and I had a miserable night.

1071
01:17:20.82 --> 01:17:24.70
If I removed the blankets I would freeze and if I left them on I would hurt.

1072
01:17:24.70 --> 01:17:31.46
I decided herding was better because I was used to that by now.

1073
01:17:31.46 --> 01:17:36.34
The next day or close to it the Japanese came around and gave each man a number.

1074
01:17:36.34 --> 01:17:40.62
Mine was 1439.

1075
01:17:40.62 --> 01:17:44.98
About this time we were also weighed.

1076
01:17:44.98 --> 01:17:47.02
We were placed on a foot scale.

1077
01:17:47.02 --> 01:17:53.66
I figured I weighed around 90 pounds after subtracting for food for shoes and clothing.

1078
01:17:53.66 --> 01:17:58.86
So if you remember he was boxing at 165 and as you know in a boxer you don't have

1079
01:17:58.86 --> 01:17:59.86
a lot of weight on you.

1080
01:17:59.86 --> 01:18:02.42
You're not sitting around with a bunch of extra weight.

1081
01:18:02.42 --> 01:18:06.22
Now he's under 90 pounds.

1082
01:18:06.22 --> 01:18:07.22
Why are they getting weighed?

1083
01:18:07.22 --> 01:18:09.02
Well he didn't know at the time why are they getting weighed?

1084
01:18:09.02 --> 01:18:12.70
They're getting weighed because they're going to be experimented on.

1085
01:18:12.70 --> 01:18:19.78
He doesn't really connect the dots in this book but obviously they're getting weighed because

1086
01:18:19.78 --> 01:18:23.82
they're trying to figure out how much weight they're going to lose and how much weight they're

1087
01:18:23.82 --> 01:18:27.30
going to gain and how long it takes them to get sick.

1088
01:18:27.30 --> 01:18:32.14
If you remember it unit 731 one of their goals was to keep the prisoners healthy enough

1089
01:18:32.14 --> 01:18:34.02
that they could experiment on them.

1090
01:18:34.02 --> 01:18:42.30
That is one I guess small benefit to this situation if I could even call it that I guess

1091
01:18:42.30 --> 01:18:49.70
I can't but there's one upside to this is that since they're going to be used as

1092
01:18:49.70 --> 01:18:56.90
experiments and again he doesn't talk about it too much and it's not very clear but

1093
01:18:56.90 --> 01:18:59.26
they start feeding them better.

1094
01:18:59.26 --> 01:19:03.46
Back to the book going to Beans from Rice I'm sure saved many prisoners lives as I

1095
01:19:03.46 --> 01:19:05.30
am almost positive it saved mine.

1096
01:19:05.30 --> 01:19:09.62
Beans are rich in vitamins and protein while rice is a starch or a carbohydrate which we

1097
01:19:09.62 --> 01:19:14.26
know is not good.

1098
01:19:14.26 --> 01:19:19.22
Contrary to expectations coming to a cold climate did not stop the dying.

1099
01:19:19.22 --> 01:19:23.82
The first winter was the worst with the killers still being distantry, hepatitis and now

1100
01:19:23.82 --> 01:19:29.30
pneumonia was added to the list and again who knows how many of these disease were actually

1101
01:19:29.30 --> 01:19:35.78
inflicted on the prisoners by the Japanese because they're in a cold climate while they're

1102
01:19:35.78 --> 01:19:38.66
getting these tropical diseases.

1103
01:19:38.66 --> 01:19:45.78
Well back to the book here the second dying had a new scourge body lice.

1104
01:19:45.78 --> 01:19:50.98
They were crawling all over by the thousands body hair clothes you know him it they were

1105
01:19:50.98 --> 01:19:52.46
there.

1106
01:19:52.46 --> 01:19:56.10
In the heat of the tropics it was flies and here it was body lice.

1107
01:19:56.10 --> 01:19:59.86
Body lice probably spread germs as readily as flies.

1108
01:19:59.86 --> 01:20:05.34
Everyone had lice but those were well enough to keep the number of lice down.

1109
01:20:05.34 --> 01:20:09.54
They got in the seams of your clothes when they went when they were not biting you and

1110
01:20:09.54 --> 01:20:12.70
that is where you looked for them.

1111
01:20:12.70 --> 01:20:16.06
Because they were discovered they were squashed between your fingernails exposing the

1112
01:20:16.06 --> 01:20:18.14
blood they had sucked from your body.

1113
01:20:18.14 --> 01:20:21.82
The Chinese coolies did not let them get away with their blood because they ate them

1114
01:20:21.82 --> 01:20:23.14
when they were discovered.

1115
01:20:23.14 --> 01:20:25.94
A Chinese coolie at rest was always searching for lice.

1116
01:20:25.94 --> 01:20:27.14
Come to think of it.

1117
01:20:27.14 --> 01:20:31.58
We were too at least at this time.

1118
01:20:31.58 --> 01:20:35.22
During that first winter all the dead were placed in the storage building.

1119
01:20:35.22 --> 01:20:40.74
That was necessary because the ground was still frozen solid making impossible to dig graves.

1120
01:20:40.74 --> 01:20:45.82
Real could not therefore take place until mid to late spring.

1121
01:20:45.82 --> 01:20:51.10
When the time arrived the large burial detail was sent out to dig graves even when even

1122
01:20:51.10 --> 01:20:55.18
then digging was difficult because only the top eight to ten inches of the ground was

1123
01:20:55.18 --> 01:20:58.42
thawed with frozen rock hard soil below.

1124
01:20:58.42 --> 01:21:01.54
This was permafrost country.

1125
01:21:01.54 --> 01:21:04.50
When the graves were finally dug we went for the bodies.

1126
01:21:04.50 --> 01:21:07.06
We found them stacked like cordwood again.

1127
01:21:07.06 --> 01:21:12.58
This is remnants of unit 731 because they were still frozen solid.

1128
01:21:12.58 --> 01:21:14.70
As in the Philippines they were all naked.

1129
01:21:14.70 --> 01:21:17.86
They looked like skeletons with skin stretched over their bones.

1130
01:21:17.86 --> 01:21:22.30
The one difference was many of the bodies were lemon yellow.

1131
01:21:22.30 --> 01:21:26.98
They had died from hepatitis or so called yellow jaundice although it was prevalent in the

1132
01:21:26.98 --> 01:21:27.98
tropics.

1133
01:21:27.98 --> 01:21:33.62
It was catching up with us now.

1134
01:21:33.62 --> 01:21:45.34
Eventually he gets well enough and they put them on a work detail in a factory and

1135
01:21:45.34 --> 01:21:46.74
still dealing with troubles.

1136
01:21:46.74 --> 01:21:50.02
Back to the book when we were in prison camps and the Philippines our strongest want or

1137
01:21:50.02 --> 01:21:52.10
desire was water.

1138
01:21:52.10 --> 01:21:53.10
Food was secondary.

1139
01:21:53.10 --> 01:21:56.54
Now that we had sufficient water it was food that was constantly on our minds.

1140
01:21:56.54 --> 01:22:00.10
I remember how we used to say that if we ever got back to the states we would carry food

1141
01:22:00.10 --> 01:22:01.98
with us wherever we went.

1142
01:22:01.98 --> 01:22:03.70
If we had a house it would be full.

1143
01:22:03.70 --> 01:22:05.78
If we had a car the trunk would be loaded.

1144
01:22:05.78 --> 01:22:10.26
The pockets of our clothes would also be stuffed with candy bars and peanuts.

1145
01:22:10.26 --> 01:22:14.30
We could at least dream if nothing else.

1146
01:22:14.30 --> 01:22:16.14
This is pretty cool.

1147
01:22:16.14 --> 01:22:20.58
In this factory and what they're doing is they're preparing this work detail is to prepare

1148
01:22:20.58 --> 01:22:27.38
a factory for the Japanese and they're putting cement flooring and they've got these big

1149
01:22:27.38 --> 01:22:31.30
machines that are going to be used to build whatever.

1150
01:22:31.30 --> 01:22:32.30
Here we go.

1151
01:22:32.30 --> 01:22:36.38
The machines that were in crates were brand new and consisted of metal lades, large drill

1152
01:22:36.38 --> 01:22:43.26
plus presses, extremely large shapers and others that I was not familiar with.

1153
01:22:43.26 --> 01:22:48.58
Closer investigation they found a little wooden box in the corner for each created machine.

1154
01:22:48.58 --> 01:22:54.34
Closer investigation revealed that the wooden box contained handles, knobs, dials, screws,

1155
01:22:54.34 --> 01:22:55.90
bolts, etc.

1156
01:22:55.90 --> 01:23:00.54
In other words precision tools and essential parts that went with the machine.

1157
01:23:00.54 --> 01:23:03.18
Right away we knew what we had to do with them.

1158
01:23:03.18 --> 01:23:05.18
Get rid of them.

1159
01:23:05.18 --> 01:23:09.18
We started by taking the smaller parts and dumping them in the latrine and the same old

1160
01:23:09.18 --> 01:23:12.26
saddle trench style but eventually got bolder.

1161
01:23:12.26 --> 01:23:16.34
When a hole was completed and ready to be filled with concrete, someone grab a bunch

1162
01:23:16.34 --> 01:23:21.34
of parts and throw them in the hole where they would be quickly covered without these

1163
01:23:21.34 --> 01:23:24.14
important parts the machines would be useless.

1164
01:23:24.14 --> 01:23:25.14
That's like hardcore.

1165
01:23:25.14 --> 01:23:27.18
These guys are still resisting and still fighting.

1166
01:23:27.18 --> 01:23:30.98
They want the Japanese to be able to build anything.

1167
01:23:30.98 --> 01:23:33.50
So they destroy these parts.

1168
01:23:33.50 --> 01:23:35.98
I mean that's at risk of obviously that's at risk of death.

1169
01:23:35.98 --> 01:23:40.30
If you get caught doing that you're going to get killed.

1170
01:23:40.30 --> 01:23:47.86
They eventually move to a different camp and this one looks, it's another one that

1171
01:23:47.86 --> 01:23:55.02
looks just like a prison and he talks about some of these other diseases.

1172
01:23:55.02 --> 01:23:59.86
When I wrote earlier of diseases that existed among the prisoners in the Philippines, I forgot

1173
01:23:59.86 --> 01:24:06.14
to mention that we also had much scurvy and something else called Gwam blisters.

1174
01:24:06.14 --> 01:24:11.22
They were like a raw sword without a scab but they started as a small blister which

1175
01:24:11.22 --> 01:24:15.02
would not heal but kept getting bigger and bigger.

1176
01:24:15.02 --> 01:24:19.54
Since there was no medication to cure them they would eat away at the entire layer of skin

1177
01:24:19.54 --> 01:24:22.46
leaving the flesh below exposed.

1178
01:24:22.46 --> 01:24:28.46
As the blister grew and devoured more skin, no scab formed which made for an ugly looking

1179
01:24:28.46 --> 01:24:30.82
sore.

1180
01:24:30.82 --> 01:24:35.74
Where the good skin was being eaten away, there was always a small rim of pus.

1181
01:24:35.74 --> 01:24:39.98
Some of these blisters has got as large as silver dollar and some of the prisoners had

1182
01:24:39.98 --> 01:24:42.66
several at one time.

1183
01:24:42.66 --> 01:24:48.30
I was lucky I did not have one but I did have a very large ringworm on my stomach.

1184
01:24:48.30 --> 01:24:54.22
It was about the size as a saucer and getting larger by the day.

1185
01:24:54.22 --> 01:24:56.98
There are something all of us, Gjitsu people can relate to.

1186
01:24:56.98 --> 01:25:02.98
You get a ringworm that is the size of a dime and it is a nightmare.

1187
01:25:02.98 --> 01:25:10.74
Here you got a ringworm that is the size of a saucer.

1188
01:25:10.74 --> 01:25:11.74
It gets worse.

1189
01:25:11.74 --> 01:25:12.74
Here we go.

1190
01:25:12.74 --> 01:25:15.82
Here came the fleas.

1191
01:25:15.82 --> 01:25:20.62
They only showed up in great numbers at night but then it was by the hundreds.

1192
01:25:20.62 --> 01:25:24.14
They were actually a lot more aggravating than the mice.

1193
01:25:24.14 --> 01:25:30.30
Their bite was a lot more painful and they made it almost impossible to sleep at night.

1194
01:25:30.30 --> 01:25:36.34
I reached a point where our underwear and look like it was made from polka dotted material

1195
01:25:36.34 --> 01:25:41.10
when in fact it was spotted with dry blood.

1196
01:25:41.10 --> 01:25:44.94
Even though we were in much better quarters our food did not improved so we still had

1197
01:25:44.94 --> 01:25:50.54
much sickness and some dying still to burculosis was now killing people and Barry Barry

1198
01:25:50.54 --> 01:25:52.42
was still prevalent.

1199
01:25:52.42 --> 01:25:57.70
I think I've been bitten by a flea five times in my whole entire life.

1200
01:25:57.70 --> 01:26:03.58
Maybe zero here, zero for echo trolls and here are these things that are biting

1201
01:26:03.58 --> 01:26:08.94
you so much that you're underwear looks like it's spotted like it's polka dotted.

1202
01:26:08.94 --> 01:26:21.02
A another person had dry Barry Barry so badly that he consented to be taken to a place

1203
01:26:21.02 --> 01:26:26.18
in Moukden where the nerves to his feet were severed.

1204
01:26:26.18 --> 01:26:31.18
It apparently relieved his pain but his feet now looked floppy to me like he did not

1205
01:26:31.18 --> 01:26:33.46
have any control of them anymore.

1206
01:26:33.46 --> 01:26:41.78
Yeah, they cut his nerves by now by now my main problem was with my teeth.

1207
01:26:41.78 --> 01:26:47.52
I had developed bad cavities in two back teeth and they hurt constantly so now his teeth

1208
01:26:47.52 --> 01:26:54.78
are all jacked up so now he goes to a to a supposed dentist.

1209
01:26:54.78 --> 01:26:58.58
I sat down in the chair one of the Japanese reach for an instrument and I instinctively

1210
01:26:58.58 --> 01:26:59.90
opened my mouth.

1211
01:26:59.90 --> 01:27:02.66
He reached in and immediately I felt this horrible pain.

1212
01:27:02.66 --> 01:27:07.22
I thought good and it is finally out in another second or two more pain just like the

1213
01:27:07.22 --> 01:27:09.58
first and more and more.

1214
01:27:09.58 --> 01:27:12.42
What was happening was that the Japanese was not pulling yet.

1215
01:27:12.42 --> 01:27:18.26
He was just cutting the gum away from the tooth so he could reach way down on it and get

1216
01:27:18.26 --> 01:27:22.50
a good grip for pulling.

1217
01:27:22.50 --> 01:27:25.34
Luckily it finally came out without any problem.

1218
01:27:25.34 --> 01:27:28.54
The pulling was less painful than the cutting.

1219
01:27:28.54 --> 01:27:33.82
I forgot to mention there was no novokane or other pain killer provided when the teeth

1220
01:27:33.82 --> 01:27:38.54
were pulled.

1221
01:27:38.54 --> 01:27:39.54
Don't like that one.

1222
01:27:39.54 --> 01:27:41.30
No sorry man.

1223
01:27:41.30 --> 01:27:44.74
Because you know when you go to the dentist it's nerve wracking.

1224
01:27:44.74 --> 01:27:45.74
It's a whole week.

1225
01:27:45.74 --> 01:27:49.46
You know I actually considered whether or not I should put that in there because I know there

1226
01:27:49.46 --> 01:27:52.30
are some people that really don't like going to the dentist.

1227
01:27:52.30 --> 01:27:56.74
I myself was never never really cared and it was not that big of a deal to me to go to

1228
01:27:56.74 --> 01:27:57.74
the dentist.

1229
01:27:57.74 --> 01:28:01.98
I know that some people have like a legitimate phobia of the dentist and I apologize.

1230
01:28:01.98 --> 01:28:04.74
I'm sure that last little section isn't going to help out.

1231
01:28:04.74 --> 01:28:08.06
No no and I don't know that I'm a phobia.

1232
01:28:08.06 --> 01:28:11.26
I think I'm just like normal dentist.

1233
01:28:11.26 --> 01:28:12.26
Reguider I guess.

1234
01:28:12.26 --> 01:28:15.98
It's a but it is nerve wracking though.

1235
01:28:15.98 --> 01:28:19.38
So you know well the dentist you know when they when they do put novokane.

1236
01:28:19.38 --> 01:28:20.38
Right.

1237
01:28:20.38 --> 01:28:21.38
That needle for some reason doesn't hurt.

1238
01:28:21.38 --> 01:28:22.38
I don't know.

1239
01:28:22.38 --> 01:28:23.38
Does it hurt?

1240
01:28:23.38 --> 01:28:24.38
I mean you don't feel the needle right?

1241
01:28:24.38 --> 01:28:25.38
You feel a little bit.

1242
01:28:25.38 --> 01:28:29.30
Yeah like with less than like if you even if you got like a blood test or something.

1243
01:28:29.30 --> 01:28:30.30
Okay.

1244
01:28:30.30 --> 01:28:34.22
So you're all numb but when they bust out that drill and doing like all the stuff they

1245
01:28:34.22 --> 01:28:39.78
do in there it's nerve wracking because you're like quite a feeling grinding my teeth

1246
01:28:39.78 --> 01:28:44.50
out whatever they're doing and then but you don't really feel the actual pain everyone

1247
01:28:44.50 --> 01:28:45.50
someone you know.

1248
01:28:45.50 --> 01:28:50.26
So it's just you're constantly at this high stress level and then this guy.

1249
01:28:50.26 --> 01:28:51.26
No no we can't.

1250
01:28:51.26 --> 01:28:58.98
Hopefully what you're at the stress level for he's just taking it head on 100%.

1251
01:28:58.98 --> 01:29:03.38
And then he's like hey when they pulled out my tooth it wasn't as bad as the cutting.

1252
01:29:03.38 --> 01:29:06.26
No cutting your gums is not going to be a good situation.

1253
01:29:06.26 --> 01:29:07.26
It is.

1254
01:29:07.26 --> 01:29:09.50
No sir it's not.

1255
01:29:09.50 --> 01:29:13.70
For a very long time now we had had no news about the progress of the war.

1256
01:29:13.70 --> 01:29:17.10
The Japanese kept telling us that before long they would be sitting in the White House in

1257
01:29:17.10 --> 01:29:18.10
Washington.

1258
01:29:18.10 --> 01:29:21.22
None of us believe this propaganda but why was it taking the US?

1259
01:29:21.22 --> 01:29:23.62
It's so long to beat the Japanese.

1260
01:29:23.62 --> 01:29:28.42
We did not or at least I did not know about Pearl Harbor and maybe that was a good thing

1261
01:29:28.42 --> 01:29:29.42
not knowing.

1262
01:29:29.42 --> 01:29:33.50
Had we known I know that Armorow would have sunk to the bottom of our toes and he's

1263
01:29:33.50 --> 01:29:40.10
just talking about the mass destruction that that would that happened.

1264
01:29:40.10 --> 01:29:45.14
So far I have not mentioned anything or very little about our thoughts of home and family.

1265
01:29:45.14 --> 01:29:50.86
It was a personal thing with every one of everyone and was little if ever discussed but

1266
01:29:50.86 --> 01:29:53.86
you can be sure that it was on everyone's mind.

1267
01:29:53.86 --> 01:29:58.42
If others were like me and I'm sure most war you thought about your parents back home

1268
01:29:58.42 --> 01:30:03.10
almost every night and knew how they were suffering not knowing where you were or how

1269
01:30:03.10 --> 01:30:07.10
you were or even if you were alive or dead.

1270
01:30:07.10 --> 01:30:09.26
This must have been an agony to them.

1271
01:30:09.26 --> 01:30:14.22
The same could be said of brothers and sisters and wives and children.

1272
01:30:14.22 --> 01:30:19.26
I always felt that the prisoners who suffered the most mentally were the ones with wives

1273
01:30:19.26 --> 01:30:21.14
and children back home.

1274
01:30:21.14 --> 01:30:26.50
I know it was extra hard on them but they were few and number.

1275
01:30:26.50 --> 01:30:30.10
Most of the men were young and not married.

1276
01:30:30.10 --> 01:30:35.50
So that's interesting if you remember when Captain Plum was on I think those guys got to

1277
01:30:35.50 --> 01:30:40.14
a level where they knew they were going to survive and even Captain Plum said he didn't

1278
01:30:40.14 --> 01:30:41.42
think he was going to die.

1279
01:30:41.42 --> 01:30:45.66
He said I was going to live like he thought that they were going to live through the

1280
01:30:45.66 --> 01:30:46.66
war.

1281
01:30:46.66 --> 01:30:51.30
And I think for these guys it must be a different and that's why the guys that were

1282
01:30:51.30 --> 01:30:55.14
in like the Noah Hilton remember they knew everything about everyone's life and every

1283
01:30:55.14 --> 01:30:58.98
single story that you would try and remember every single possible thing that you could

1284
01:30:58.98 --> 01:31:02.62
about your whole life and tell it to your roommate.

1285
01:31:02.62 --> 01:31:08.82
But I think these guys are in such a state where survival is not a known entity.

1286
01:31:08.82 --> 01:31:15.22
And so I think it sounds like and he mentioned earlier that not knowing people was actually

1287
01:31:15.22 --> 01:31:23.66
easier so it's sort of a different psychological situation.

1288
01:31:23.66 --> 01:31:29.54
Now he goes on I know everyone enjoyed going to sleep at night and if you dreamed it was

1289
01:31:29.54 --> 01:31:36.82
usually always the same but it left you extremely depressed the next day in most dreams

1290
01:31:36.82 --> 01:31:44.22
you were at last freed from prison camp and back in the states and feeling you fork.

1291
01:31:44.22 --> 01:31:49.10
Free free free again.

1292
01:31:49.10 --> 01:31:52.70
How wonderful.

1293
01:31:52.70 --> 01:32:00.54
But the shock of awakening was so heartbreaking when you found out you were still in prison.

1294
01:32:00.54 --> 01:32:05.42
I believe these dreams actually did more harm than good even so they came back time

1295
01:32:05.42 --> 01:32:06.78
and time again.

1296
01:32:06.78 --> 01:32:11.22
There was no getting away from them.

1297
01:32:11.22 --> 01:32:19.02
And no the people not home were not forgotten and we knew they had not forgotten us.

1298
01:32:19.02 --> 01:32:22.70
So that's you have these beautiful dreams that everything is cool and you wake up and you're

1299
01:32:22.70 --> 01:32:26.26
still in prison camp.

1300
01:32:26.26 --> 01:32:31.30
Back to the book the Japanese put everyone to digging fox holes.

1301
01:32:31.30 --> 01:32:35.54
They were not for us but for the Japanese some were at the factory and some of on the

1302
01:32:35.54 --> 01:32:41.30
Japanese side of the camp none were on our side.

1303
01:32:41.30 --> 01:32:47.14
When this work started we knew that the Japanese were now expecting possible air raids

1304
01:32:47.14 --> 01:32:50.62
and we were excited because the war was getting closer.

1305
01:32:50.62 --> 01:32:54.22
It wasn't too much longer after we finished digging all of the fox holes that we were

1306
01:32:54.22 --> 01:32:56.42
required to cover them over.

1307
01:32:56.42 --> 01:33:02.10
They were covered with heavy timbers and then further covered with a large amount of dirt.

1308
01:33:02.10 --> 01:33:06.10
This told the Japanese that we were taking this told us that the Japanese were taking a

1309
01:33:06.10 --> 01:33:10.02
pounding somewhere which an armines was great.

1310
01:33:10.02 --> 01:33:14.10
At about the same time the Japanese were becoming rather aggressive and there was a definite

1311
01:33:14.10 --> 01:33:17.54
change in their attitude and treatment of us.

1312
01:33:17.54 --> 01:33:21.94
We now had to really watch what we were doing and if we did anything illegal make sure

1313
01:33:21.94 --> 01:33:24.74
we were not caught.

1314
01:33:24.74 --> 01:33:29.10
Some of the men were caught however and suffered the consequences.

1315
01:33:29.10 --> 01:33:30.62
So this is great news.

1316
01:33:30.62 --> 01:33:38.78
They're like oh you got to dig in that means Americans are common.

1317
01:33:38.78 --> 01:33:43.02
One morning shortly after we had gone to work air raids cyber and started going off all

1318
01:33:43.02 --> 01:33:47.86
over the city and everyone became very excited especially the Japanese.

1319
01:33:47.86 --> 01:33:51.50
We were quickly rounded up and made a double time back to camp.

1320
01:33:51.50 --> 01:33:54.78
This time we were not searched but sent immediately to our barracks and told us to stay

1321
01:33:54.78 --> 01:33:55.78
inside.

1322
01:33:55.78 --> 01:33:58.42
We could still hear sirens going off in all directions.

1323
01:33:58.42 --> 01:34:02.30
We had not been back to our barracks very long when the Japanese came back and said everyone

1324
01:34:02.30 --> 01:34:04.10
outside in the yard.

1325
01:34:04.10 --> 01:34:09.86
Our yard was probably 150 to 200 feet long and perhaps 100 feet wide more or less.

1326
01:34:09.86 --> 01:34:14.50
When everyone was out the Japanese made us lie down and then took off probably for their

1327
01:34:14.50 --> 01:34:16.14
foxholes.

1328
01:34:16.14 --> 01:34:21.54
It wasn't long before we could see a large formation of heavy bombers headed our way.

1329
01:34:21.54 --> 01:34:26.06
They were up very high and each left a streak in the sky that extended for many miles

1330
01:34:26.06 --> 01:34:27.82
behind it.

1331
01:34:27.82 --> 01:34:31.74
It was a beautiful sight and we felt proud and excited.

1332
01:34:31.74 --> 01:34:37.58
It had to be American planes and the war had reached Manchuria.

1333
01:34:37.58 --> 01:34:42.14
We watched them slowly come our way but the Japanese also saw them coming and sent up

1334
01:34:42.14 --> 01:34:46.46
fighter planes to intercept them which was a mistake.

1335
01:34:46.46 --> 01:34:50.70
From the ground it looked like a swarm of mosquitoes going after a flock of geese and the

1336
01:34:50.70 --> 01:34:57.42
pink comparison is good because that is about how effective the Japanese fighters were.

1337
01:34:57.42 --> 01:35:01.66
In the ground we could see flashes of fire coming from the bombers and see Japanese planes

1338
01:35:01.66 --> 01:35:04.78
go plunging down in smoke.

1339
01:35:04.78 --> 01:35:09.38
Just about then you could hear the roar of the guns from the bombers as the sound reached

1340
01:35:09.38 --> 01:35:11.02
the ground.

1341
01:35:11.02 --> 01:35:14.82
Time after time the japs moved in but the results were the same.

1342
01:35:14.82 --> 01:35:18.18
Japs going down in flame with no apparent damage to the bombers.

1343
01:35:18.18 --> 01:35:21.82
What a fight.

1344
01:35:21.82 --> 01:35:26.94
I would like to interrupt writing about this attack at this point to mention that our prison

1345
01:35:26.94 --> 01:35:32.94
camp was in the middle of a heavy, heavily industrialized area which was against international

1346
01:35:32.94 --> 01:35:34.66
rules of war.

1347
01:35:34.66 --> 01:35:37.70
We should not have been imprisoned where we were.

1348
01:35:37.70 --> 01:35:43.06
Right next to us was an ammunition factory and a short distance behind us a tank factory.

1349
01:35:43.06 --> 01:35:46.70
We were very close to an airplane factory and a major rail yard.

1350
01:35:46.70 --> 01:35:51.62
There were numerous military targets for Americans to bomb and unfortunately we were right

1351
01:35:51.62 --> 01:35:54.10
in the middle of them.

1352
01:35:54.10 --> 01:35:58.90
The lying on my back I kept my eyes on the bombers and was impressed by the large number

1353
01:35:58.90 --> 01:36:03.62
in the formation about 18 or 20 as I recall.

1354
01:36:03.62 --> 01:36:09.62
Pretty soon I could see the silver flashes of released bombs and then in another few seconds

1355
01:36:09.62 --> 01:36:14.94
saw the sky filled with hundreds of bombs hertling down on us and making their typical

1356
01:36:14.94 --> 01:36:16.82
loud swishing sound.

1357
01:36:16.82 --> 01:36:21.62
I knew they would not miss and they did not.

1358
01:36:21.62 --> 01:36:27.02
Three of the bombs from the plane on the outside of the formation hit our camp and the destruction

1359
01:36:27.02 --> 01:36:28.98
was horrible.

1360
01:36:28.98 --> 01:36:33.26
One of the bombs landed near the high brick wall that surrounded our compound and knocked

1361
01:36:33.26 --> 01:36:35.22
a big chunk out of its top.

1362
01:36:35.22 --> 01:36:40.14
The bombs fell right in the yard where we were lying and instantly killed 19 of us and

1363
01:36:40.14 --> 01:36:43.14
severely wounded many more.

1364
01:36:43.14 --> 01:36:47.98
The third bomb was an incendiary and fell on our barracks and set it on fire.

1365
01:36:47.98 --> 01:36:54.34
It was a tragedy here we were after so very long a time excited beyond belief at watching

1366
01:36:54.34 --> 01:36:58.90
our side win for a change and look what happened.

1367
01:36:58.90 --> 01:37:05.98
We could hardly believe it but we were now being killed by our own bombs.

1368
01:37:05.98 --> 01:37:09.78
Even though I was within 20 feet or so of the bomb I was not hurt.

1369
01:37:09.78 --> 01:37:16.62
I looked up as I looked up I saw men blackened from the blast try to rise but fall back

1370
01:37:16.62 --> 01:37:19.86
terribly wounded or dead.

1371
01:37:19.86 --> 01:37:28.86
Again it's the heavies from the other side the other perspective.

1372
01:37:28.86 --> 01:37:36.62
Now at a certain point one of those bombs one of those bombers did get shot down and the

1373
01:37:36.62 --> 01:37:43.38
air crew and pilots from the aircraft that got shot down got captured.

1374
01:37:43.38 --> 01:37:48.42
And so here we go these were men who had survived the blowing up of their B-29 bomber

1375
01:37:48.42 --> 01:37:53.38
and were now being held captive in a house within sight of our camp.

1376
01:37:53.38 --> 01:37:57.78
They said they did not know of our prison camp and they get communication with them.

1377
01:37:57.78 --> 01:38:02.10
They said they did not know of our prison camp and in actuality it was marked on their

1378
01:38:02.10 --> 01:38:06.02
maps as they must get target.

1379
01:38:06.02 --> 01:38:11.42
This wasn't terribly reassuring but they did pass on more cheering information than that.

1380
01:38:11.42 --> 01:38:16.38
They said Japan was being defeated all over the Pacific and it appeared that the war should

1381
01:38:16.38 --> 01:38:19.50
not last too very much longer.

1382
01:38:19.50 --> 01:38:23.34
By the action in the sky we had already come to assume that.

1383
01:38:23.34 --> 01:38:31.22
They also said that they were flying out of from the island of Guam.

1384
01:38:31.22 --> 01:38:33.46
There was always the possible they feel like the war.

1385
01:38:33.46 --> 01:38:38.10
Okay but this is obviously a really positive side the Japanese are getting beat all over

1386
01:38:38.10 --> 01:38:41.94
the Pacific the bombers are there even though it's horrible that they're getting bomb

1387
01:38:41.94 --> 01:38:45.86
they at least feel like the war is getting in the right direction but then there's this

1388
01:38:45.86 --> 01:38:50.98
back to the book there was always the possibility we felt that when the war was over or

1389
01:38:50.98 --> 01:38:56.74
about over and the Japanese realized that they had lost they made decide to execute all

1390
01:38:56.74 --> 01:39:00.14
of us instead of letting us go free.

1391
01:39:00.14 --> 01:39:05.66
So they got that in the back of their mind.

1392
01:39:05.66 --> 01:39:09.82
Little section here he gets in some trouble one morning when we arrived at the factory

1393
01:39:09.82 --> 01:39:14.10
and headed for our work in the lumber yard we noticed Japanese soldiers all over the

1394
01:39:14.10 --> 01:39:17.50
place they were running and crawling and obviously playing war so the Japanese were

1395
01:39:17.50 --> 01:39:18.90
running and drill.

1396
01:39:18.90 --> 01:39:22.70
We just ignored what was going on and walked right through them to get to our shack.

1397
01:39:22.70 --> 01:39:25.98
When we were in the process of hanging up our coats when a jitter we were in the process

1398
01:39:25.98 --> 01:39:35.78
of hanging up our coats when a Japanese officer burst in and all of us and he was mad, mad, mad.

1399
01:39:35.78 --> 01:39:41.94
So he gets in trouble the the Japanese officer that's all mad lines up everyone in the

1400
01:39:41.94 --> 01:39:47.58
little shack and he has his savor in his left hand and he started punching each guy in

1401
01:39:47.58 --> 01:39:55.46
the face and that's what that's what he does and he ends up the end up getting in trouble.

1402
01:39:55.46 --> 01:40:01.42
Because they got punched I guess they got in trouble because they got punched and finally

1403
01:40:01.42 --> 01:40:05.82
he's going to be questioned and he's in this going to get questioned this guard house

1404
01:40:05.82 --> 01:40:11.70
which is sort of like where they do solitary confinement in this guard house the prison

1405
01:40:11.70 --> 01:40:12.94
within the prison.

1406
01:40:12.94 --> 01:40:19.54
So James is about to get interrogated back to the book.

1407
01:40:19.54 --> 01:40:22.94
He asked me if I thought that the Japanese officer of the factory had a right to hit us the

1408
01:40:22.94 --> 01:40:24.34
way he did.

1409
01:40:24.34 --> 01:40:29.74
I hesitated for a second like I was pondering the question then answered well I am not

1410
01:40:29.74 --> 01:40:34.46
sure just as soon as these words came out of my mouth I knew that I had answered wrong

1411
01:40:34.46 --> 01:40:38.14
but nothing happened and I was questioned a bit further until the same question came

1412
01:40:38.14 --> 01:40:39.14
up again.

1413
01:40:39.14 --> 01:40:43.14
Did I think that the Japanese officer at the factory had the right to hit us the way he

1414
01:40:43.14 --> 01:40:44.98
did?

1415
01:40:44.98 --> 01:40:49.78
For a second I was in a quandary should I just say yes sir or should I repeat my first

1416
01:40:49.78 --> 01:40:50.78
answer?

1417
01:40:50.78 --> 01:40:55.82
I decided maybe being consistent was the way to go so I repeated my original answer

1418
01:40:55.82 --> 01:40:59.74
and that was a mistake almost instantly I was hit on the right side of my jaw with a

1419
01:40:59.74 --> 01:41:04.70
close fist not by the officer but by the interpreter.

1420
01:41:04.70 --> 01:41:08.34
From that point on he decided to slap me in the face as hard as he could.

1421
01:41:08.34 --> 01:41:13.54
I think he really hurt his fist when he hurt me the first time which is why he changed

1422
01:41:13.54 --> 01:41:16.02
to the slap.

1423
01:41:16.02 --> 01:41:21.06
Over a while you are being beaten you are being made to stand a detention with this kind

1424
01:41:21.06 --> 01:41:27.02
of beating you don't give them the satisfaction of knowing you letting them know you are hurt.

1425
01:41:27.02 --> 01:41:31.86
You just don't let yourself fall down and moan all I could think about was you little

1426
01:41:31.86 --> 01:41:36.94
son of a bitch if I could just get you alone under different circumstances I would tear

1427
01:41:36.94 --> 01:41:40.46
you apart.

1428
01:41:40.46 --> 01:41:45.06
After the beating stopped I was thrown into the guard house with the rest of the guys.

1429
01:41:45.06 --> 01:41:51.34
The inside of my mouth was badly cut and I swallowed blood for several days my face was swollen

1430
01:41:51.34 --> 01:41:54.42
and I had black eyes.

1431
01:41:54.42 --> 01:41:59.18
I stayed in the guard house for about three weeks.

1432
01:41:59.18 --> 01:42:03.42
Conditions in the guard house were unbelievably cruel and I hope I can explain exactly what

1433
01:42:03.42 --> 01:42:08.26
it was like it was built similar to our barracks accepted had cells instead of separate

1434
01:42:08.26 --> 01:42:09.58
sleeping quarters.

1435
01:42:09.58 --> 01:42:12.66
There was a central hall with cells on either side.

1436
01:42:12.66 --> 01:42:17.82
Cell was about eight feet wide and probably 12 feet long with a very narrow slit trench

1437
01:42:17.82 --> 01:42:21.14
for a latrine in the back corner.

1438
01:42:21.14 --> 01:42:29.14
The floor was concrete and that was it no bed blanket chair or anything else.

1439
01:42:29.14 --> 01:42:34.26
The guard house with solitary confinement at its worst.

1440
01:42:34.26 --> 01:42:38.02
I found the hardest thing to take was the boredom.

1441
01:42:38.02 --> 01:42:43.58
You heard the song time goes by so slowly well it certainly applied then standing in one

1442
01:42:43.58 --> 01:42:47.38
place even if not a detention can be a killer.

1443
01:42:47.38 --> 01:42:51.98
I used to watch a spot of light that came in through the crack on the board at window and

1444
01:42:51.98 --> 01:42:54.90
it almost drove me mad.

1445
01:42:54.90 --> 01:42:58.46
I tried to ignore it but I couldn't.

1446
01:42:58.46 --> 01:43:00.50
It would be made to get up.

1447
01:43:00.50 --> 01:43:05.38
I would be made to get up in the morning at five o'clock and several hours later when

1448
01:43:05.38 --> 01:43:08.34
there was sufficient light the spot would appear.

1449
01:43:08.34 --> 01:43:13.18
It first showed up on one side of my cell and then moved so terribly slowly across the

1450
01:43:13.18 --> 01:43:15.54
other side until it finally disappeared.

1451
01:43:15.54 --> 01:43:20.30
After it was gone I knew I still had several hours to go before I would get rest.

1452
01:43:20.30 --> 01:43:29.70
It was agony to watch and it was the same thing day after day after day.

1453
01:43:29.70 --> 01:43:34.70
And then eventually we were probably released when we were without the usual trial

1454
01:43:34.70 --> 01:43:40.94
and sentencing because the Russians invaded Manchuria.

1455
01:43:40.94 --> 01:43:42.38
Here we go.

1456
01:43:42.38 --> 01:43:48.54
At this point I would like to refer you to a diary that I started on August 15th, 1945

1457
01:43:48.54 --> 01:43:51.62
and continued until September 2nd, 1945.

1458
01:43:51.62 --> 01:43:55.90
It tells the story as it was happening which is much better than my trying to recall events

1459
01:43:55.90 --> 01:43:57.26
50 years later.

1460
01:43:57.26 --> 01:44:02.46
The diary is short but I think it's worth including here.

1461
01:44:02.46 --> 01:44:08.94
We end up with him getting released and he starts tracking what's happening because he

1462
01:44:08.94 --> 01:44:10.66
can.

1463
01:44:10.66 --> 01:44:17.22
There were some Americans that were brought into the situation and he starts keeping a little

1464
01:44:17.22 --> 01:44:24.46
journal as he said and I'm just going to read a little bit from the journal.

1465
01:44:24.46 --> 01:44:29.58
Americans working at the Japanese garage brought in news that about the same time that

1466
01:44:29.58 --> 01:44:32.58
the war was definitely over.

1467
01:44:32.58 --> 01:44:37.82
They said that a nip told them that Japan had surrendered at 930 o'clock on 15th of

1468
01:44:37.82 --> 01:44:38.82
August.

1469
01:44:38.82 --> 01:44:42.18
These men were willing to bet anything on this dope.

1470
01:44:42.18 --> 01:44:49.26
Yes, optimism, rain, supreme and I had never seen excitement such as this before.

1471
01:44:49.26 --> 01:44:53.50
But such a heart rendering drop came a little while later when World was passed around

1472
01:44:53.50 --> 01:44:58.10
that these six new men had been placed under locking key in the guard house.

1473
01:44:58.10 --> 01:45:02.98
Yes, morale rating was now zero minus.

1474
01:45:02.98 --> 01:45:04.90
Now we'll go August 17th.

1475
01:45:04.90 --> 01:45:07.14
This morning we found out who these new men are.

1476
01:45:07.14 --> 01:45:11.78
They are American volunteers who were flown over from China to take over this prison camp

1477
01:45:11.78 --> 01:45:15.54
and to see that the Japanese did not mistreat us.

1478
01:45:15.54 --> 01:45:19.94
Also set up communications between here and our American forces.

1479
01:45:19.94 --> 01:45:24.02
The story of their undertaking is very thrilling in these men deserve a word of praise

1480
01:45:24.02 --> 01:45:29.06
and credit for their brave deed.

1481
01:45:29.06 --> 01:45:30.06
And then this happens.

1482
01:45:30.06 --> 01:45:34.50
The American assembly call was blown about eight o'clock and we formed outside where

1483
01:45:34.50 --> 01:45:38.14
General Parker the senior American official made a speech.

1484
01:45:38.14 --> 01:45:43.62
Before he would cut us in on the real dope, he told us that we must be calm and maintain

1485
01:45:43.62 --> 01:45:45.74
a hold on ourselves.

1486
01:45:45.74 --> 01:45:49.66
He emphatically stressed that there were to be no demonstrations.

1487
01:45:49.66 --> 01:45:55.50
He proceeded to tell us of the armistice between America, England, the Netherlands and

1488
01:45:55.50 --> 01:45:59.46
Japan which brought about a roaring cheer from the prisoners.

1489
01:45:59.46 --> 01:46:06.66
But he warned us that we were still prisoners and that Japan and Russia were still at war.

1490
01:46:06.66 --> 01:46:10.50
This little speech brought happiness to everyone even though we knew what he was going to

1491
01:46:10.50 --> 01:46:12.14
say before he started.

1492
01:46:12.14 --> 01:46:15.54
This was the news that we had been waiting to hear for three and a half years and it was

1493
01:46:15.54 --> 01:46:17.34
now official.

1494
01:46:17.34 --> 01:46:19.14
Man, three and a half years.

1495
01:46:19.14 --> 01:46:25.02
So I just buzzed through this in an hour and forty seven minutes right now and this is

1496
01:46:25.02 --> 01:46:26.34
three and a half years.

1497
01:46:26.34 --> 01:46:30.50
You got to get the book and then you got to think about even more than what's great

1498
01:46:30.50 --> 01:46:35.14
you read about in the book.

1499
01:46:35.14 --> 01:46:38.86
We were still under Japanese guard but the administrative administration of the camp was

1500
01:46:38.86 --> 01:46:42.14
taken over by Americans.

1501
01:46:42.14 --> 01:46:48.02
We really we really chowed like we should have now that we had the keys to the store room.

1502
01:46:48.02 --> 01:46:51.10
So boom, let's go.

1503
01:46:51.10 --> 01:46:56.26
There's they start seeing Russian pursuit planes over the camp.

1504
01:46:56.26 --> 01:47:02.50
Sunday the 19th held church services to get today in thanksgiving for our wars ending.

1505
01:47:02.50 --> 01:47:04.34
More Russian planes overhead today.

1506
01:47:04.34 --> 01:47:07.78
The men really got to throw out of seeing friendly planes again.

1507
01:47:07.78 --> 01:47:11.90
They're all anxious to see the American Air Force and its large bombers that they've

1508
01:47:11.90 --> 01:47:13.46
heard so much about.

1509
01:47:13.46 --> 01:47:18.26
Sunday August 20th we were told today that the Russians would be in camp.

1510
01:47:18.26 --> 01:47:22.38
Saw our first B-24 bomber today at around 430.

1511
01:47:22.38 --> 01:47:24.42
The prisoners really went wild with joy.

1512
01:47:24.42 --> 01:47:28.98
It's circled over the camp three two or three times and dropped leaflets telling us about

1513
01:47:28.98 --> 01:47:34.42
the war being over and for us to remain where we were until help arrived.

1514
01:47:34.42 --> 01:47:36.30
These leaflets were late.

1515
01:47:36.30 --> 01:47:41.90
They should have been dropped before the parachute is came in and that's the rumor mill.

1516
01:47:41.90 --> 01:47:43.98
The guys that had come in earlier.

1517
01:47:43.98 --> 01:47:49.02
The Russians came in at about 7 o'clock and did they cause great excitement.

1518
01:47:49.02 --> 01:47:51.42
There was a general in five or six officers.

1519
01:47:51.42 --> 01:47:55.38
The general called us together and gave us a speech and American prisoner acted as an

1520
01:47:55.38 --> 01:47:56.62
interpreter.

1521
01:47:56.62 --> 01:48:01.86
The general said that from this day on we were free and no longer under the hand of the

1522
01:48:01.86 --> 01:48:02.86
Japanese.

1523
01:48:02.86 --> 01:48:05.06
The crowd went wild with joy.

1524
01:48:05.06 --> 01:48:06.90
Cheer after cheer rang through the air.

1525
01:48:06.90 --> 01:48:11.30
He told us how in the last 10 days they had covered 1,000 kilometers of mountain streams

1526
01:48:11.30 --> 01:48:12.66
and wilderness.

1527
01:48:12.66 --> 01:48:14.18
More cheering from the crowd.

1528
01:48:14.18 --> 01:48:19.62
He told us that he was in Berlin when Germany surrendered and met officers of the US-8th

1529
01:48:19.62 --> 01:48:21.12
Army.

1530
01:48:21.12 --> 01:48:25.82
He said that he would he told them that he would soon be leaving to fight Japan and that

1531
01:48:25.82 --> 01:48:29.62
he would set us free.

1532
01:48:29.62 --> 01:48:34.30
Also had a ceremony of the surrender of the Japanese guards and the turning over of their

1533
01:48:34.30 --> 01:48:36.90
sabers and arms to the American guards.

1534
01:48:36.90 --> 01:48:42.14
It was quite an interesting and strange spectacle what made it appear strange was that it

1535
01:48:42.14 --> 01:48:44.90
was performed in the light of the moon.

1536
01:48:44.90 --> 01:48:49.06
The Russian general presented general Parker with a Japanese revolver.

1537
01:48:49.06 --> 01:48:54.14
The ceremony was completed by the Russian general having the American guards parade the

1538
01:48:54.14 --> 01:49:02.26
Japanese before the prisoners and off the parade ground.

1539
01:49:02.26 --> 01:49:08.34
The restraint is insane.

1540
01:49:08.34 --> 01:49:10.02
It's hard for me.

1541
01:49:10.02 --> 01:49:16.34
I consider myself to be a pretty emotionally controlled person.

1542
01:49:16.34 --> 01:49:21.74
I think if I was in that prison for 3.5 years and the war ended and the Japanese that

1543
01:49:21.74 --> 01:49:26.14
had tortured and beat and starved, we might have a little something to talk about.

1544
01:49:26.14 --> 01:49:30.14
I might have a little something for those guys a little bit more than just marching around

1545
01:49:30.14 --> 01:49:32.18
the camp.

1546
01:49:32.18 --> 01:49:39.50
What that shows you, it shows you that that's how professional the American soldier is.

1547
01:49:39.50 --> 01:49:40.50
It's amazing.

1548
01:49:40.50 --> 01:49:41.50
It's amazing.

1549
01:49:41.50 --> 01:49:44.70
We got this from Unit 731.

1550
01:49:44.70 --> 01:49:45.70
Those books as well.

1551
01:49:45.70 --> 01:49:49.54
The people that were being tortured, they got turned over by the Russians and said, do what

1552
01:49:49.54 --> 01:49:57.62
you want with them and the determination was, we're going to treat them humanely.

1553
01:49:57.62 --> 01:50:02.66
Back to the book, back to the diary, September 2nd, we have been moving, we have been

1554
01:50:02.66 --> 01:50:07.02
having moving pictures means movies for at least two nights.

1555
01:50:07.02 --> 01:50:11.58
I've never enjoyed anything so much before in all of my life.

1556
01:50:11.58 --> 01:50:16.18
Being in prison camp for so long almost made me forget what was going on back in America.

1557
01:50:16.18 --> 01:50:20.10
I'm just beginning to realize now what I have missed.

1558
01:50:20.10 --> 01:50:23.78
If I would have seen a movie two years ago, my freighter would have tried to escape

1559
01:50:23.78 --> 01:50:26.06
at any cost.

1560
01:50:26.06 --> 01:50:29.94
If I would have realized what I was really missing, this long time in prison camp would

1561
01:50:29.94 --> 01:50:33.82
have been much harder to bear.

1562
01:50:33.82 --> 01:50:38.74
More sick left by plane today, our new Colonel told us that we would probably be out of

1563
01:50:38.74 --> 01:50:42.62
here, out here for at least another month.

1564
01:50:42.62 --> 01:50:46.86
What's a measly month more after having been here for so long?

1565
01:50:46.86 --> 01:50:56.02
In fact, it is good to know that we will be leaving for home in only a month's time.

1566
01:50:56.02 --> 01:51:05.38
Yeah, when you kind of consider in his mind, it's either it went from never to one month.

1567
01:51:05.38 --> 01:51:08.38
So it's like, oh, I can't do that month.

1568
01:51:08.38 --> 01:51:14.62
Yeah, it's also interesting how he got detached from what the world had and he actually

1569
01:51:14.62 --> 01:51:16.02
found that beneficial.

1570
01:51:16.02 --> 01:51:18.66
And I've talked about the first interview I did with Tim Ferriss.

1571
01:51:18.66 --> 01:51:23.02
I talked about how I kind of detached from what's going on.

1572
01:51:23.02 --> 01:51:26.50
I don't know from like pictures of my kids and didn't hang them up because I didn't want

1573
01:51:26.50 --> 01:51:27.50
to be thinking about that.

1574
01:51:27.50 --> 01:51:28.90
So they're to do the job.

1575
01:51:28.90 --> 01:51:31.94
You can see that he's saying he would have gone crazy and tried to escape a feed.

1576
01:51:31.94 --> 01:51:35.98
No, he was missing.

1577
01:51:35.98 --> 01:51:36.98
Back to the book.

1578
01:51:36.98 --> 01:51:40.02
When we finally got to see what the Japanese had on their side of the prison camp, we

1579
01:51:40.02 --> 01:51:42.02
were astonished and mad.

1580
01:51:42.02 --> 01:51:46.78
They had a room full of male and packages from the states that they never delivered plus

1581
01:51:46.78 --> 01:51:49.82
the large quantity of red cross packages.

1582
01:51:49.82 --> 01:51:54.34
We speculated that the Japanese were living off our red cross packages when food became

1583
01:51:54.34 --> 01:52:01.90
scarce, food that was meant for us.

1584
01:52:01.90 --> 01:52:06.14
By now, since we were all free to leave prison camp and wander, everyone was looking

1585
01:52:06.14 --> 01:52:10.86
for a Japanese savor to take home as a souvenir from the war, it would show that at long

1586
01:52:10.86 --> 01:52:21.58
last in the end we were the winners and they were vanquished.

1587
01:52:21.58 --> 01:52:27.34
Eventually, and again, get the book that he's leaving, moked in.

1588
01:52:27.34 --> 01:52:32.08
I was on the last truck out and as we pulled away, I saw the Russians come out of the

1589
01:52:32.08 --> 01:52:36.46
front gate with the Japanese and walk on the outside of the brick wall toward the back

1590
01:52:36.46 --> 01:52:37.46
of the camp.

1591
01:52:37.46 --> 01:52:42.82
My impression was that they were going to line the Japanese up against a back brick wall

1592
01:52:42.82 --> 01:52:45.46
and shoot them.

1593
01:52:45.46 --> 01:52:49.14
Check.

1594
01:52:49.14 --> 01:52:55.82
I'm supporting the Russians and this one, I think.

1595
01:52:55.82 --> 01:52:57.66
Back to the book.

1596
01:52:57.66 --> 01:53:04.86
They end up in the port in China where they're going to get their ride home on a ship.

1597
01:53:04.86 --> 01:53:09.18
There was an American transport waiting for us to dock, but when the ship capped and saw

1598
01:53:09.18 --> 01:53:13.06
all of us armed with rifles and sabers, he would not let us on the ship unless we gave

1599
01:53:13.06 --> 01:53:14.50
up our weapons.

1600
01:53:14.50 --> 01:53:18.34
We said no way, Captain, these are ours and we're not going to part with them.

1601
01:53:18.34 --> 01:53:22.38
He then said that he would safely store them for us and they would be returned when we

1602
01:53:22.38 --> 01:53:23.86
docked.

1603
01:53:23.86 --> 01:53:27.38
Our reply was an emphatic, no.

1604
01:53:27.38 --> 01:53:30.66
By now we were looking for a place to sack out because we were not going to board

1605
01:53:30.66 --> 01:53:32.50
that ship without our arms.

1606
01:53:32.50 --> 01:53:36.86
After a lengthy delay, the captain relented and we were finally allowed on the ship with

1607
01:53:36.86 --> 01:53:38.86
our sabers clanking at our sides.

1608
01:53:38.86 --> 01:53:44.66
He talks about they go through great efforts to get these Japanese sabers.

1609
01:53:44.66 --> 01:53:48.86
Once on the ship we were given a cursory medical check, D-Louse, and given clean clothes

1610
01:53:48.86 --> 01:53:52.14
I believe before being taken to our living quarters.

1611
01:53:52.14 --> 01:53:55.58
Our dispute with the captain, the ship was over now and everyone could relax and clean

1612
01:53:55.58 --> 01:53:58.06
quarters on a very comfortable bed.

1613
01:53:58.06 --> 01:54:02.90
This was the first real mattress that I'd slept on since leaving the SS Coolidge almost

1614
01:54:02.90 --> 01:54:06.06
four years ago.

1615
01:54:06.06 --> 01:54:10.30
It felt great and the food provided was also very good.

1616
01:54:10.30 --> 01:54:13.82
Now our minds and bodies were truly at ease.

1617
01:54:13.82 --> 01:54:20.02
No mattress for f- You know when you got to sleep in the airport or whatever and you

1618
01:54:20.02 --> 01:54:23.38
complain about it, that's a carpet.

1619
01:54:23.38 --> 01:54:26.74
That's actually a pretty good deal and you've got to sweatshirt that you've wrapped up

1620
01:54:26.74 --> 01:54:28.94
in and you put a little something under your head.

1621
01:54:28.94 --> 01:54:30.42
A bathroom too by the way.

1622
01:54:30.42 --> 01:54:32.06
Yeah, there's a nice bathroom.

1623
01:54:32.06 --> 01:54:33.06
Right?

1624
01:54:33.06 --> 01:54:36.86
There's not nice, dig into your skin or flees eating at your...

1625
01:54:36.86 --> 01:54:45.10
Four years, four years on the dirt.

1626
01:54:45.10 --> 01:54:49.82
So now they get to, they sail from there to Okinawa.

1627
01:54:49.82 --> 01:54:53.54
Once they're in Okinawa, they're doing a little bit of port timing Okinawa getting

1628
01:54:53.54 --> 01:54:58.06
some supplies.

1629
01:54:58.06 --> 01:55:26.62
This was in the open water instead of the shallow bay.

1630
01:55:26.62 --> 01:55:30.58
This I could hear sailors working their way down toward us shouting everyone topside

1631
01:55:30.58 --> 01:55:37.58
to everybody topside and prepare to abandon ship.

1632
01:55:37.58 --> 01:55:39.98
Everybody topside, hurry, hurry.

1633
01:55:39.98 --> 01:55:42.34
And he goes through some of the details.

1634
01:55:42.34 --> 01:55:47.62
We had hit a mine which tore a hole in the side of our ship and flooded the engine

1635
01:55:47.62 --> 01:55:50.26
room and in turn knocked out our power.

1636
01:55:50.26 --> 01:55:55.10
There was a possibility that the ship might sink, which is why we were all ordered topside

1637
01:55:55.10 --> 01:55:57.10
and given life preserves.

1638
01:55:57.10 --> 01:56:00.62
We had to be ready to abandon ship if needed.

1639
01:56:00.62 --> 01:56:03.14
Even if we abandoned ship, I doubt many of us would have survived.

1640
01:56:03.14 --> 01:56:04.66
It was still dark on the top of that.

1641
01:56:04.66 --> 01:56:08.66
There was no possible way to lower the life boats with the ship, lurching back and

1642
01:56:08.66 --> 01:56:11.18
forth as it was.

1643
01:56:11.18 --> 01:56:15.54
Once on deck we had to tie ourselves to something to keep from getting thrown off.

1644
01:56:15.54 --> 01:56:17.02
At least that is what I did.

1645
01:56:17.02 --> 01:56:21.26
I found a place where I could sit down and also time myself with the straps of my life

1646
01:56:21.26 --> 01:56:23.18
preserver.

1647
01:56:23.18 --> 01:56:28.66
I now everyone was wet from the driving rain and the wind, whistled and howled I thought

1648
01:56:28.66 --> 01:56:34.18
to myself is our misery ever going to end.

1649
01:56:34.18 --> 01:56:36.38
When daylight came I sort of wished it hadn't.

1650
01:56:36.38 --> 01:56:38.90
What I saw was enough to scare a person to death.

1651
01:56:38.90 --> 01:56:44.22
We were a drift in violent seas with 50 foot waves.

1652
01:56:44.22 --> 01:56:48.94
You had to look almost straight up to see their crests when they came rolling toward you.

1653
01:56:48.94 --> 01:56:55.54
You were much higher than the ship, especially when the ship was in a trough.

1654
01:56:55.54 --> 01:56:58.38
So they had hit this mine.

1655
01:56:58.38 --> 01:56:59.62
Yeah.

1656
01:56:59.62 --> 01:57:01.34
The engine room was flooded.

1657
01:57:01.34 --> 01:57:04.62
There are still 200 miles from Okinawa.

1658
01:57:04.62 --> 01:57:15.06
This is the captain comes on and is like, don't worry, we are only 200 miles from Okinawa.

1659
01:57:15.06 --> 01:57:18.62
He says to himself, hey, I can't swim 200 miles.

1660
01:57:18.62 --> 01:57:21.46
I'm about you, Captain.

1661
01:57:21.46 --> 01:57:25.42
Back to the book besides severely damaging the ship, the exploding mine was responsible

1662
01:57:25.42 --> 01:57:30.86
for the deaths of about 10 ex prisoners and several sailors that were in the engine room.

1663
01:57:30.86 --> 01:57:34.58
The ex prisoners were on the deck when the mine went off.

1664
01:57:34.58 --> 01:57:39.70
The explosion slung landing ladders that were hanging on the side of the ship up and over

1665
01:57:39.70 --> 01:57:42.14
the railing like lethal whips.

1666
01:57:42.14 --> 01:57:45.30
These men were apparently killed instantly.

1667
01:57:45.30 --> 01:57:49.02
These were the same ladders that we had used to board the ship just a few days earlier.

1668
01:57:49.02 --> 01:57:52.66
I felt the press and I'm sure that the other men felt the same.

1669
01:57:52.66 --> 01:57:59.14
These were men who were on their way home after their terribly long and hard ordeal

1670
01:57:59.14 --> 01:58:02.74
and now they were dead.

1671
01:58:02.74 --> 01:58:09.02
To get this far and still not make it was unbelievable, the japs finally got them after

1672
01:58:09.02 --> 01:58:12.42
all with their floating mine.

1673
01:58:12.42 --> 01:58:16.82
I couldn't help but think of the poor parents and families back home.

1674
01:58:16.82 --> 01:58:21.66
They had been notified that their son or husband or brother was on his way home and you

1675
01:58:21.66 --> 01:58:28.10
can imagine the joy that they felt now they had to be notified that they had been killed

1676
01:58:28.10 --> 01:58:33.42
on the way home.

1677
01:58:33.42 --> 01:58:34.66
Yeah.

1678
01:58:34.66 --> 01:58:41.22
They eventually go from Okinawa to Manila and then from Manila.

1679
01:58:41.22 --> 01:58:45.18
They're waiting for a ship to go back to the states one day I finally saw my name on

1680
01:58:45.18 --> 01:58:50.62
a list pinned to a bulletin board as I was leaving as one leaving by ship for the states

1681
01:58:50.62 --> 01:58:53.18
on such and such a date.

1682
01:58:53.18 --> 01:58:54.50
Before long, it gets on the ship.

1683
01:58:54.50 --> 01:58:58.42
Before long, the last of the tropical islands disappeared in the distance where now well

1684
01:58:58.42 --> 01:58:59.78
out in the open ocean.

1685
01:58:59.78 --> 01:59:04.74
There was nothing to do but eat, sleep and read and this would go on for several weeks.

1686
01:59:04.74 --> 01:59:09.42
My body tingled in the dark when I thought about what the future might bring.

1687
01:59:09.42 --> 01:59:15.82
Coming out on the deck with a cool breeze blowing and the ship gently rocking made me feel

1688
01:59:15.82 --> 01:59:23.02
a little guilty for having it so good.

1689
01:59:23.02 --> 01:59:25.90
Goes on.

1690
01:59:25.90 --> 01:59:28.94
They sail.

1691
01:59:28.94 --> 01:59:32.94
One day we spotted land and before long we were going under the Golden Gate Bridge and

1692
01:59:32.94 --> 01:59:35.06
in to San Francisco Bay.

1693
01:59:35.06 --> 01:59:40.46
We eventually docked at the same pier where we had taken off almost four years earlier.

1694
01:59:40.46 --> 01:59:44.38
At the dock, many soldiers were met by their families and you could see the joy in their

1695
01:59:44.38 --> 01:59:47.30
faces as they tightly embraced each other.

1696
01:59:47.30 --> 01:59:53.02
They had been to war and survived.

1697
01:59:53.02 --> 01:59:55.26
Now they check into a hospital.

1698
01:59:55.26 --> 02:00:01.26
One of the first things that the doctor said when he saw me was you have hepatitis.

1699
02:00:01.26 --> 02:00:05.90
We were fed four large meals a day between meals and nurses brought around ice cream,

1700
02:00:05.90 --> 02:00:08.14
candy and cookies for anyone that was still hungry.

1701
02:00:08.14 --> 02:00:11.78
They were obviously trying to fatten us up before we went home.

1702
02:00:11.78 --> 02:00:14.14
Finally he gets on a hospital train car.

1703
02:00:14.14 --> 02:00:17.02
He heads for San Antonio, Texas.

1704
02:00:17.02 --> 02:00:21.78
From there he was finally given a pass to go home.

1705
02:00:21.78 --> 02:00:23.70
He's with a friend of his.

1706
02:00:23.70 --> 02:00:27.98
Before we got to Lafayette, I talked to my friend and was staying overnight and Crowley so

1707
02:00:27.98 --> 02:00:31.06
we could clean up and be rested for our trip home the next day.

1708
02:00:31.06 --> 02:00:35.62
We spent the night at the rice hotel.

1709
02:00:35.62 --> 02:00:39.98
Next morning I decided to get a haircut so I went to a barber shop nearby.

1710
02:00:39.98 --> 02:00:43.82
The barber started talking about the boys that had left to go to war.

1711
02:00:43.82 --> 02:00:47.94
Some of whom had been killed.

1712
02:00:47.94 --> 02:00:56.22
He then talked about a family that lived near Moata that had two sons killed and another

1713
02:00:56.22 --> 02:00:59.30
missing in action.

1714
02:00:59.30 --> 02:01:03.82
He said that the one missing in action later turned out to be a prisoner of war of the

1715
02:01:03.82 --> 02:01:06.98
Japanese.

1716
02:01:06.98 --> 02:01:14.02
I was shocked beyond belief and I know I turned pale because I was positive he was talking

1717
02:01:14.02 --> 02:01:20.18
about me and my brothers even though he did not give names.

1718
02:01:20.18 --> 02:01:26.18
This news came as a complete surprise but I had begun to suspect something before now in

1719
02:01:26.18 --> 02:01:31.62
a letter or two that I sent home I inquired about Andrew and Stephen.

1720
02:01:31.62 --> 02:01:36.62
But never got me information concerning them when I received mail and returned.

1721
02:01:36.62 --> 02:01:42.66
I thought maybe they had overlooked my questions or at worst or at worst maybe they had

1722
02:01:42.66 --> 02:01:45.26
been wounded in the war.

1723
02:01:45.26 --> 02:01:49.86
I knew that Stephen was in the service but not Andrew.

1724
02:01:49.86 --> 02:01:58.70
You can imagine my grief when I found out they had both been killed.

1725
02:01:58.70 --> 02:02:03.78
Before long I decided to call my sister Eunice to see if she could come and get me and of

1726
02:02:03.78 --> 02:02:06.34
course she was overjoyed to hear my voice.

1727
02:02:06.34 --> 02:02:10.50
She said that she would be over as soon as she could before long she arrived and some

1728
02:02:10.50 --> 02:02:13.62
of her first words that she said were Pat.

1729
02:02:13.62 --> 02:02:16.90
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

1730
02:02:16.90 --> 02:02:20.42
That was a nickname that my family calls me.

1731
02:02:20.42 --> 02:02:28.02
I knew what she was about to say so I stopped her and said I already know about my brothers.

1732
02:02:28.02 --> 02:02:30.86
I finally got to the farm.

1733
02:02:30.86 --> 02:02:33.82
My mother met me at the front gate.

1734
02:02:33.82 --> 02:02:40.90
She was crying which I expected and started to tell me about Andrew and Stephen.

1735
02:02:40.90 --> 02:02:48.42
I told her I knew everything and everything would be alright but she kept crying.

1736
02:02:48.42 --> 02:02:54.62
We hugged each other for a while and finally I was able to shake hands with my father.

1737
02:02:54.62 --> 02:03:05.38
He said one word, Pat and I said one, Papa and that was it.

1738
02:03:05.38 --> 02:03:16.62
He was never much for talking but I knew that he was glad to see me back.

1739
02:03:16.62 --> 02:03:24.94
So after all that he comes home and finds out that both of his brothers had been killed.

1740
02:03:24.94 --> 02:03:31.22
His father says hey if you want to stay here and work at the farm and hang out that's

1741
02:03:31.22 --> 02:03:36.06
fine and he tells his dad no he's going to go to college and finish his degree in the

1742
02:03:36.06 --> 02:03:45.34
GI bill covers his cost of his college and he says there's not a great deal to do while

1743
02:03:45.34 --> 02:03:46.34
home on leave.

1744
02:03:46.34 --> 02:03:52.62
I walked in the woods a lot and visited our old swimming hole at the big cypress tree.

1745
02:03:52.62 --> 02:04:00.58
I thought of the fun we used to have and especially the mudfights that we're so exciting.

1746
02:04:00.58 --> 02:04:06.94
We were all grown up now that is the ones who were still alive.

1747
02:04:06.94 --> 02:04:13.14
Such a change in five and one half years.

1748
02:04:13.14 --> 02:04:20.18
I was given my discharge on February 17th, 1946.

1749
02:04:20.18 --> 02:04:25.14
I'd been in the service for five and one half years and those are years I shall never forget.

1750
02:04:25.14 --> 02:04:31.34
When I was in the service I always felt so very young because everyone else was older than me.

1751
02:04:31.34 --> 02:04:35.30
Returning to college I felt just the opposite.

1752
02:04:35.30 --> 02:04:42.58
I felt so much older than most of my students and of course I was.

1753
02:04:42.58 --> 02:04:47.30
One thing I never talked about while in college was my experience in the service.

1754
02:04:47.30 --> 02:04:53.70
I would tell new friends that I was a veteran and had served overseas but that was it.

1755
02:04:53.70 --> 02:05:00.86
I was still abiding by the military's requests not to tell about your POW experience to anyone.

1756
02:05:00.86 --> 02:05:06.82
I may not have had trouble keeping my POW experiences to myself after my return.

1757
02:05:06.82 --> 02:05:15.10
But one aspect of the experiences I did have trouble with and that was my dreams at night.

1758
02:05:15.10 --> 02:05:20.98
Almost every night when I fell asleep I found myself back in prison camp and I would

1759
02:05:20.98 --> 02:05:24.98
think to myself and my dream how did this happen.

1760
02:05:24.98 --> 02:05:28.90
I was sure I'd been freed.

1761
02:05:28.90 --> 02:05:32.42
It was heartbreaking to find that I was still a prisoner.

1762
02:05:32.42 --> 02:05:37.14
It was just the reverse of what I had experienced in prison camp when I always dreamed I was

1763
02:05:37.14 --> 02:05:41.18
free.

1764
02:05:41.18 --> 02:05:46.66
When I woke up during the war I found I was still a prisoner.

1765
02:05:46.66 --> 02:05:52.42
I was not at least when I woke up as a civilian.

1766
02:05:52.42 --> 02:05:53.22
I found that I was free.

1767
02:05:53.22 --> 02:05:58.98
As good as this felt it was still very disturbing mentally because these dreams lasted for about

1768
02:05:58.98 --> 02:06:03.22
10 years.

1769
02:06:03.22 --> 02:06:07.98
For the first few years I hated to go to sleep.

1770
02:06:07.98 --> 02:06:13.10
But luckily the dreams became less frequent.

1771
02:06:13.10 --> 02:06:18.94
And now they are not completely gone.

1772
02:06:18.94 --> 02:06:25.22
This dream tells me that in the recesses of my mind I am still haunted by my participation

1773
02:06:25.22 --> 02:06:31.02
and experiences during the baton death march.

1774
02:06:31.02 --> 02:06:38.14
It is something that I will undoubtedly be there always.

1775
02:06:38.14 --> 02:06:47.50
Even though I may not be able to control my dreams I long ago learned to live with my life

1776
02:06:47.50 --> 02:06:53.02
as though none of this had ever happened.

1777
02:06:53.02 --> 02:06:59.02
The dream that keeps coming back most often is one in which I find myself across a large

1778
02:06:59.02 --> 02:07:02.30
body of water.

1779
02:07:02.30 --> 02:07:10.54
I know that I must walk for miles and miles to return to where I want to be.

1780
02:07:10.54 --> 02:07:16.94
In my mind I know I have made this long, long walk before and I know how difficult and

1781
02:07:16.94 --> 02:07:23.14
time consuming it will be.

1782
02:07:23.14 --> 02:07:29.98
In my dream I feel completely dejected because I wonder what could have happened to get

1783
02:07:29.98 --> 02:07:36.18
me back to this place again.

1784
02:07:36.18 --> 02:07:44.14
But in my dream I start walking.

1785
02:07:44.14 --> 02:07:51.14
I start walking.

1786
02:07:51.14 --> 02:07:59.94
I think that that right there wraps up the book and I think that is a very powerful

1787
02:07:59.94 --> 02:08:10.62
message for everyone, for everyone no matter what you face.

1788
02:08:10.62 --> 02:08:21.06
No matter how bad it is going to be when there is a challenge.

1789
02:08:21.06 --> 02:08:26.86
By a challenge I mean anything in life any challenge.

1790
02:08:26.86 --> 02:08:35.26
The thing that you're facing the only way to overcome the challenges that you face is

1791
02:08:35.26 --> 02:08:39.82
to start walking.

1792
02:08:39.82 --> 02:08:45.18
Take that step.

1793
02:08:45.18 --> 02:08:53.38
That is what James Bowley did.

1794
02:08:53.38 --> 02:09:02.46
The baton death march, it was absolutely ruled a war crime after the war.

1795
02:09:02.46 --> 02:09:11.26
The Japanese lieutenant general, Homa Masaharu, who oversaw the march and oversaw the atrocities

1796
02:09:11.26 --> 02:09:14.98
that took place during the march.

1797
02:09:14.98 --> 02:09:17.82
He was put on trial.

1798
02:09:17.82 --> 02:09:30.02
He was found guilty of war crimes and he was executed April 3rd 1946 just outside of Manila.

1799
02:09:30.02 --> 02:09:33.18
But James Bowley lived.

1800
02:09:33.18 --> 02:09:35.18
He survived the death march.

1801
02:09:35.18 --> 02:09:45.22
He survived three and a half years in absolutely wretched conditions and James Bowley survives

1802
02:09:45.22 --> 02:09:47.62
today.

1803
02:09:47.62 --> 02:09:54.02
He still alive and he lives in Louisiana still.

1804
02:09:54.02 --> 02:10:02.26
And as a matter of fact on the 25th of May of this year 2018 James Bowley was awarded the

1805
02:10:02.26 --> 02:10:12.82
Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award for the accomplishments that he achieved

1806
02:10:12.82 --> 02:10:15.06
in his life and that he has achieved in his life.

1807
02:10:15.06 --> 02:10:17.26
He's a retired geologist.

1808
02:10:17.26 --> 02:10:24.22
He's written 11 books including the one that I read from today, a soldier's journal.

1809
02:10:24.22 --> 02:10:31.94
And actually the copy that I got, which I got from a used bookstore, he's got a note.

1810
02:10:31.94 --> 02:10:45.02
He signed it and his signature has a note and the note says simply respect the flag.

1811
02:10:45.02 --> 02:10:57.66
And I definitely recommend you pick up a copy of the book and I also recommend that you

1812
02:10:57.66 --> 02:11:05.74
take his advice every day no matter what you are facing.

1813
02:11:05.74 --> 02:11:12.66
Get up and start walking.

1814
02:11:12.66 --> 02:11:16.58
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1815
02:11:16.58 --> 02:11:25.10
So echo Charles, I guess at this point maybe since we're talking about walking you

1816
02:11:25.10 --> 02:11:27.14
could tell us how to walk.

1817
02:11:27.14 --> 02:11:29.42
Maybe you know walk down the path a little bit.

1818
02:11:29.42 --> 02:11:31.22
A little bit of an easier walk.

1819
02:11:31.22 --> 02:11:33.94
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1820
02:11:33.94 --> 02:11:41.86
There was another actually a few other books where this was like that where every

1821
02:11:41.86 --> 02:11:45.90
situation he kind of goes through, you just get more and more exhaust like you're exhausted

1822
02:11:45.90 --> 02:11:48.18
because you kind of think like, okay, it'll start to let up.

1823
02:11:48.18 --> 02:11:49.18
Yeah.

1824
02:11:49.18 --> 02:11:50.66
And then it's great.

1825
02:11:50.66 --> 02:11:52.38
It doesn't let out in his mind.

1826
02:11:52.38 --> 02:11:53.38
It's madness.

1827
02:11:53.38 --> 02:11:58.18
And then the storm, if you put this like if you put this into a movie, you wouldn't believe

1828
02:11:58.18 --> 02:11:59.18
it, yeah.

1829
02:11:59.18 --> 02:12:00.18
It's a aisle known.

1830
02:12:00.18 --> 02:12:01.18
It's a really gonna have a storm.

1831
02:12:01.18 --> 02:12:02.18
Oh, they're gonna get a line.

1832
02:12:02.18 --> 02:12:03.18
Come on.

1833
02:12:03.18 --> 02:12:04.18
Yeah.

1834
02:12:04.18 --> 02:12:05.18
I'm not buying that.

1835
02:12:05.18 --> 02:12:06.18
No, it's true.

1836
02:12:06.18 --> 02:12:08.52
Yeah, it literally does sound like something like someone would try to put in a movie.

1837
02:12:08.52 --> 02:12:09.52
Yeah.

1838
02:12:09.52 --> 02:12:11.44
Oh, his journey was so hard.

1839
02:12:11.44 --> 02:12:13.44
Yeah, everyone by the way.

1840
02:12:13.44 --> 02:12:14.44
Yeah.

1841
02:12:14.44 --> 02:12:18.84
And you kind of feel when he starts talking about like, for some reason, I don't

1842
02:12:18.84 --> 02:12:22.32
know, maybe it's because I'm kind of hungry right now, but when he's talking, he's

1843
02:12:22.32 --> 02:12:24.000
starring me and I was being the star.

1844
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.04
And then when he, when he'd be like, yeah, when they switched.

1845
02:12:27.04 --> 02:12:34.52
So we're talking about a man that was lost 75 pounds of body weight.

1846
02:12:34.52 --> 02:12:36.24
Who was the beating man?

1847
02:12:36.24 --> 02:12:38.92
He was an eating and you have an eating in four hours.

1848
02:12:38.92 --> 02:12:41.28
And you're still here throwing that after.

1849
02:12:41.28 --> 02:12:43.28
I'm not comparing, bro.

1850
02:12:43.28 --> 02:12:44.28
You compare.

1851
02:12:44.28 --> 02:12:45.28
No, no, no, you did.

1852
02:12:45.28 --> 02:12:46.28
I'm not comparing.

1853
02:12:46.28 --> 02:12:49.92
I'm saying I kind of felt like felt his situation in the eye and I.

1854
02:12:49.92 --> 02:12:50.92
Oh, man.

1855
02:12:50.92 --> 02:12:52.72
You might want to edit yourself out.

1856
02:12:52.72 --> 02:12:54.20
No, it's under that head.

1857
02:12:54.20 --> 02:12:54.56
I did.

1858
02:12:54.56 --> 02:12:55.48
I will say this.

1859
02:12:55.48 --> 02:12:56.08
I will say this.

1860
02:12:56.08 --> 02:12:59.56
You know what I'm looking forward to tonight is I'm going to go.

1861
02:12:59.56 --> 02:13:00.68
First of all, I've been traveling.

1862
02:13:00.68 --> 02:13:01.68
I am tired.

1863
02:13:01.68 --> 02:13:02.68
Sure.

1864
02:13:02.68 --> 02:13:07.24
And tonight, I'm going to go enjoy my mattress and my bed.

1865
02:13:07.24 --> 02:13:08.24
Yeah.

1866
02:13:08.24 --> 02:13:09.80
Think about that when I'm crawling.

1867
02:13:09.80 --> 02:13:11.60
I've got to, I got to pretty nice bed.

1868
02:13:11.60 --> 02:13:12.92
It's nothing crazy.

1869
02:13:12.92 --> 02:13:13.92
But it's nice.

1870
02:13:13.92 --> 02:13:16.16
You're going to California King is.

1871
02:13:16.16 --> 02:13:17.80
That's the biggest bed you can get.

1872
02:13:17.80 --> 02:13:19.16
It's the longest.

1873
02:13:19.16 --> 02:13:20.72
Eastern King is wider.

1874
02:13:20.72 --> 02:13:21.72
Really?

1875
02:13:21.72 --> 02:13:22.72
Yeah, man.

1876
02:13:22.72 --> 02:13:24.28
I spent a lot of time trying to do.

1877
02:13:24.28 --> 02:13:25.28
Oh, man.

1878
02:13:25.28 --> 02:13:26.88
I've got the California King.

1879
02:13:26.88 --> 02:13:27.88
Thank you.

1880
02:13:27.88 --> 02:13:34.12
And I'm going to get in that day tonight with the bed spread on it.

1881
02:13:34.12 --> 02:13:35.12
Yeah.

1882
02:13:35.12 --> 02:13:38.12
So you felt, you were feeling this man a little bit extra too.

1883
02:13:38.12 --> 02:13:41.88
Then when he was talking about the floor and all this stuff, and then he finally got

1884
02:13:41.88 --> 02:13:44.44
out in that mattress that he hadn't been, you know, no mattresses.

1885
02:13:44.44 --> 02:13:50.64
Yeah, I think if you compare anything, literally anything in that book, anything that

1886
02:13:50.64 --> 02:13:53.56
he's talking about, you can just say, I have it good.

1887
02:13:53.56 --> 02:13:54.56
I don't care who you are.

1888
02:13:54.56 --> 02:13:55.56
Oh, yeah.

1889
02:13:55.56 --> 02:13:56.56
I got it so good.

1890
02:13:56.56 --> 02:13:59.60
I'm just living in the lap of complete luxury.

1891
02:13:59.60 --> 02:14:01.24
You have read it.

1892
02:14:01.24 --> 02:14:02.84
You know, the part when they were like, oh, yeah.

1893
02:14:02.84 --> 02:14:06.12
And then they feed us cookies and candy bars.

1894
02:14:06.12 --> 02:14:07.12
Yeah, whatever.

1895
02:14:07.12 --> 02:14:10.84
But when you're saying that, I was thinking tonight, if I want to, and I'm considering

1896
02:14:10.84 --> 02:14:14.60
it too still, right now by the way, I can go to the store on the way home.

1897
02:14:14.60 --> 02:14:17.64
By the way, and just pick up as many candy bars as the way.

1898
02:14:17.64 --> 02:14:18.64
Right now.

1899
02:14:18.64 --> 02:14:19.84
This candy bar stakes ice cream.

1900
02:14:19.84 --> 02:14:20.84
Oh, yeah.

1901
02:14:20.84 --> 02:14:23.08
You can pretty much any possible thing.

1902
02:14:23.08 --> 02:14:29.88
You could possibly imagine you can get within seven minutes of departing from this

1903
02:14:29.88 --> 02:14:30.88
podcast.

1904
02:14:30.88 --> 02:14:34.12
This place right now on your way to your California, on the California, on the California

1905
02:14:34.12 --> 02:14:38.16
Kangabad. Yeah, and the sheets and the strength. Yeah, put your blanket.

1906
02:14:38.16 --> 02:14:38.64
Yeah, yeah.

1907
02:14:38.64 --> 02:14:39.64
So that's cool.

1908
02:14:39.64 --> 02:14:40.48
Yeah, that's nice.

1909
02:14:40.48 --> 02:14:42.36
We'll be able to pull your blankets over yourself.

1910
02:14:42.36 --> 02:14:42.68
Yeah.

1911
02:14:42.68 --> 02:14:44.36
It's not so malnutrition.

1912
02:14:44.36 --> 02:14:44.72
Yeah.

1913
02:14:44.72 --> 02:14:47.96
And when the blankets are on you, that's kind of nice.

1914
02:14:47.96 --> 02:14:48.36
Yeah.

1915
02:14:48.36 --> 02:14:49.36
It doesn't cause you pain.

1916
02:14:49.36 --> 02:14:51.64
Yeah, it doesn't like suffocate because you're going to break your rib.

1917
02:14:51.64 --> 02:14:52.64
Just like that.

1918
02:14:52.64 --> 02:14:53.44
Yeah, bro.

1919
02:14:53.44 --> 02:14:54.44
Big time.

1920
02:14:54.44 --> 02:14:56.84
And let me, and yeah, but you were feeling it though.

1921
02:14:56.84 --> 02:14:57.84
I think you might.

1922
02:14:57.84 --> 02:14:58.48
Okay, let me.

1923
02:14:58.48 --> 02:14:59.88
I wasn't for the people out.

1924
02:14:59.88 --> 02:15:01.04
Definitely feeling it.

1925
02:15:01.04 --> 02:15:02.68
Okay, here's Jocca today.

1926
02:15:02.68 --> 02:15:03.52
By the way.

1927
02:15:03.52 --> 02:15:06.88
I witnessed his whole journey more or less his whole journey.

1928
02:15:06.88 --> 02:15:09.32
Cause I follow him on Instagram.

1929
02:15:09.32 --> 02:15:10.32
So what?

1930
02:15:10.32 --> 02:15:13.68
350 recorded wake-ups.

1931
02:15:13.68 --> 02:15:15.64
So you probably woke up at at the very.

1932
02:15:15.64 --> 02:15:16.16
Yeah, I think.

1933
02:15:16.16 --> 02:15:16.92
Let's wait for it.

1934
02:15:16.92 --> 02:15:18.16
One, one, one, one, three, 45.

1935
02:15:18.16 --> 02:15:18.48
Okay.

1936
02:15:18.48 --> 02:15:19.16
So three, 45.

1937
02:15:19.16 --> 02:15:19.76
I was in Denver.

1938
02:15:19.76 --> 02:15:21.60
I had to, I was in Denver.

1939
02:15:21.60 --> 02:15:22.44
Denver.

1940
02:15:22.44 --> 02:15:25.84
And then yeah, so I had to catch an early.

1941
02:15:25.84 --> 02:15:27.20
I wasn't actually wasn't in Denver.

1942
02:15:27.20 --> 02:15:28.20
I was in Boulder.

1943
02:15:28.20 --> 02:15:30.08
So I had to get a car from Boulder.

1944
02:15:30.08 --> 02:15:31.44
It's that one for one hour.

1945
02:15:31.44 --> 02:15:32.16
That's one hour.

1946
02:15:32.16 --> 02:15:33.16
I put one.

1947
02:15:33.16 --> 02:15:34.16
Yeah, it's one hour.

1948
02:15:34.16 --> 02:15:35.16
Okay, so 250.

1949
02:15:35.16 --> 02:15:36.16
Okay.

1950
02:15:36.16 --> 02:15:37.16
Oh, I didn't think about that.

1951
02:15:37.16 --> 02:15:38.16
Yeah.

1952
02:15:38.16 --> 02:15:39.16
Yeah.

1953
02:15:39.16 --> 02:15:40.16
You were taking away credit.

1954
02:15:40.16 --> 02:15:46.36
Nonetheless, 250 wake up travel, which, like I said earlier,

1955
02:15:46.36 --> 02:15:47.36
trick it.

1956
02:15:47.36 --> 02:15:50.84
Okay, so travel from Colorado to San Diego.

1957
02:15:50.84 --> 02:15:52.08
To me, that's the day already.

1958
02:15:52.08 --> 02:15:53.08
My day is done.

1959
02:15:53.08 --> 02:15:54.08
You know, my work is done.

1960
02:15:54.08 --> 02:15:55.60
The space that I got to recover from that.

1961
02:15:55.60 --> 02:15:56.60
That's me.

1962
02:15:56.60 --> 02:15:57.60
Okay, you come home.

1963
02:15:57.60 --> 02:15:58.60
You do what?

1964
02:15:58.60 --> 02:15:59.60
Oh, we're down.

1965
02:15:59.60 --> 02:16:00.60
Oh, on your way home, you prep.

1966
02:16:00.60 --> 02:16:03.08
Yeah, I finished prep podcast.

1967
02:16:03.08 --> 02:16:08.16
And then when I got home, the first thing I did when I got home was finish the prep of

1968
02:16:08.16 --> 02:16:09.16
the podcast.

1969
02:16:09.16 --> 02:16:10.80
I had about another hour to do.

1970
02:16:10.80 --> 02:16:13.80
Okay, so then you shift mentally to a workout.

1971
02:16:13.80 --> 02:16:14.80
Yeah.

1972
02:16:14.80 --> 02:16:16.56
Okay, so, so here's the thing.

1973
02:16:16.56 --> 02:16:18.68
Where, you know, a workout, cool workout.

1974
02:16:18.68 --> 02:16:23.24
I've worked out after, bro, when I worked at the night clubs, I'd work out after

1975
02:16:23.24 --> 02:16:25.40
a whole day and at like three in the morning.

1976
02:16:25.40 --> 02:16:27.40
And I'd trained you just to be forward.

1977
02:16:27.40 --> 02:16:28.40
You know, social.

1978
02:16:28.40 --> 02:16:30.40
Here's the thing, though.

1979
02:16:30.40 --> 02:16:36.60
You make that mental shift where you're like, okay, you wake up at 250am, you travel.

1980
02:16:36.60 --> 02:16:39.56
To me, mentally traveling just just kind of finishes me.

1981
02:16:39.56 --> 02:16:42.84
You know, I got to kind of recover, you know, unless I have something lingering or something

1982
02:16:42.84 --> 02:16:43.84
like that.

1983
02:16:43.84 --> 02:16:44.84
Okay, there's that.

1984
02:16:44.84 --> 02:16:48.68
Then you still working, by the way, shift into workout mode.

1985
02:16:48.68 --> 02:16:50.32
Still the morning, by the way.

1986
02:16:50.32 --> 02:16:55.12
Okay, so workout mode, you get your workout done, which is, we're not going to

1987
02:16:55.12 --> 02:16:57.92
detail them, but it's a mini-conditioning circuit.

1988
02:16:57.92 --> 02:16:59.92
Yeah, I pretty much took me.

1989
02:16:59.92 --> 02:17:00.92
I don't know.

1990
02:17:00.92 --> 02:17:03.56
Yeah, but yeah, basically, the most solid little workout.

1991
02:17:03.56 --> 02:17:08.28
If, if personally, you know, speaking for myself, if I'm going to skip a workout on a day

1992
02:17:08.28 --> 02:17:12.20
where I don't feel like it is going to be one of those workouts, one of those ones that

1993
02:17:12.20 --> 02:17:16.68
you're doing like, you know, burpees and they're like, the junk ones.

1994
02:17:16.68 --> 02:17:17.68
Okay.

1995
02:17:17.68 --> 02:17:18.68
The pain for anyway.

1996
02:17:18.68 --> 02:17:19.68
Like if you're a little bit of a get-to.

1997
02:17:19.68 --> 02:17:22.80
Yeah, and then so, but your gets exactly right.

1998
02:17:22.80 --> 02:17:24.000
And then you're going to do Jitu.

1999
02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Yeah.

2000
02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Do bunch of rounds.

2001
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Yeah.

2002
02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
A bunch of hours.

2003
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Over an hour of straight rolling.

2004
02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:29.84
Yeah.

2005
02:17:29.84 --> 02:17:31.84
I mean, you know, you have breaks between rounds.

2006
02:17:31.84 --> 02:17:32.84
Yeah.

2007
02:17:32.84 --> 02:17:35.84
But it was an hour as about an hour and 15 minutes.

2008
02:17:35.84 --> 02:17:36.84
Yeah.

2009
02:17:36.84 --> 02:17:37.84
Okay.

2010
02:17:37.84 --> 02:17:38.84
So that's a big deal.

2011
02:17:38.84 --> 02:17:41.84
That's way, that's like maybe two or three times the amount of, we'll say, quote, unquote, normal

2012
02:17:41.84 --> 02:17:43.84
rolling depending on who you are.

2013
02:17:43.84 --> 02:17:44.84
Okay.

2014
02:17:44.84 --> 02:17:46.84
And with like Andy, a subteller here.

2015
02:17:46.84 --> 02:17:47.84
And an entailer.

2016
02:17:47.84 --> 02:17:48.84
Okay.

2017
02:17:48.84 --> 02:17:49.84
So, all right.

2018
02:17:49.84 --> 02:17:52.84
So, it's not like you're by with some guy get to maybe catch a new girl or something

2019
02:17:52.84 --> 02:17:53.84
like this.

2020
02:17:53.84 --> 02:17:54.84
No, it's not like this.

2021
02:17:54.84 --> 02:17:55.84
Okay.

2022
02:17:55.84 --> 02:17:56.84
Okay.

2023
02:17:56.84 --> 02:17:57.84
Here we go.

2024
02:17:57.84 --> 02:17:58.84
Still on Jockel's schedule, by the way.

2025
02:17:58.84 --> 02:17:59.84
I'm just going to be a podcast.

2026
02:17:59.84 --> 02:18:00.84
Okay.

2027
02:18:00.84 --> 02:18:03.84
So, guy, I'm trying to imagine your state of being in your mind.

2028
02:18:03.84 --> 02:18:08.84
And then when he said the part, actually there's a bunch of parts when he's talking

2029
02:18:08.84 --> 02:18:14.84
about on the ship and, you know, the breeze and the basically the rest parts, I think you

2030
02:18:14.84 --> 02:18:15.84
were feeling that.

2031
02:18:15.84 --> 02:18:17.84
What do you mean I was feeling it?

2032
02:18:17.84 --> 02:18:21.84
Because you had that state, you have that state of like, you put in a lot of work.

2033
02:18:21.84 --> 02:18:25.84
And now you, you know, you're kind of on the backside to the recovery portion of the day.

2034
02:18:25.84 --> 02:18:26.84
Oh, yeah.

2035
02:18:26.84 --> 02:18:27.84
So I think that part resonated with you.

2036
02:18:27.84 --> 02:18:29.84
Yeah, I guess so.

2037
02:18:29.84 --> 02:18:30.84
Right.

2038
02:18:30.84 --> 02:18:31.84
Well, there it is.

2039
02:18:31.84 --> 02:18:32.84
Boom.

2040
02:18:32.84 --> 02:18:33.84
See, I know long explanation, but still.

2041
02:18:33.84 --> 02:18:34.84
Just saying.

2042
02:18:34.84 --> 02:18:35.84
I guess so.

2043
02:18:35.84 --> 02:18:38.84
But you got to remember that even like, like you just described my day, but there's people out there

2044
02:18:38.84 --> 02:18:41.84
that did five times more than when I did today.

2045
02:18:41.84 --> 02:18:42.84
Yeah.

2046
02:18:42.84 --> 02:18:45.84
There's, there's people everywhere that are getting after it.

2047
02:18:45.84 --> 02:18:46.84
Super.

2048
02:18:46.84 --> 02:18:47.84
Yeah.

2049
02:18:47.84 --> 02:18:48.84
More than a day.

2050
02:18:48.84 --> 02:18:50.84
Some people every single day, you know.

2051
02:18:50.84 --> 02:18:51.84
Yeah.

2052
02:18:51.84 --> 02:18:52.84
No, it's true.

2053
02:18:52.84 --> 02:18:53.84
It's up a little bit.

2054
02:18:53.84 --> 02:18:54.84
And it does.

2055
02:18:54.84 --> 02:18:59.84
A lot of books like this man where the, you know what kind of got me fired up was Dan Bat.

2056
02:18:59.84 --> 02:19:00.84
Dan Bat's here.

2057
02:19:00.84 --> 02:19:01.84
Yeah.

2058
02:19:01.84 --> 02:19:02.84
Yeah.

2059
02:19:02.84 --> 02:19:03.84
And he, and the family's home.

2060
02:19:03.84 --> 02:19:04.84
Yeah.

2061
02:19:04.84 --> 02:19:05.84
And his wife.

2062
02:19:05.84 --> 02:19:10.84
And so Dan Bat's a guy that's been like kind of in the game for since day one.

2063
02:19:10.84 --> 02:19:14.84
And he, and, and, and so I knew him from social media.

2064
02:19:14.84 --> 02:19:17.84
And as soon as I saw him, he's like, hey, I'm, and I was like, hey, what's up man?

2065
02:19:17.84 --> 02:19:18.84
Yeah.

2066
02:19:18.84 --> 02:19:19.84
Yeah.

2067
02:19:19.84 --> 02:19:20.84

02:19:20.84 --> 02:19:21.84

02:19:35.84 --> 02:19:41.84
And, and I was, you know, he was all just like, he's like, oh, you're going to record right now.

2073
02:19:41.84 --> 02:19:43.84
And I was like, yeah, and he was pumped.

2074
02:19:43.84 --> 02:19:44.84
Yeah.

02:19:44.84 --> 02:19:45.84
Yeah.

2076
02:19:45.84 --> 02:19:46.84
Yeah.

2077
02:19:46.84 --> 02:19:47.84
Yeah.

2078
02:19:47.84 --> 02:19:47.84
Yeah.

2079
02:19:47.84 --> 02:19:48.84
Yeah.

2080
02:19:48.84 --> 02:19:49.84
Yeah.

02:19:49.84 --> 02:19:50.84
Yeah.

2082
02:19:50.84 --> 02:19:51.84
Yeah.

2083
02:19:51.84 --> 02:19:52.84
I mean I know, we know.

2084
02:19:52.84 --> 02:19:55.84
And you know, my mother is like, you know, she's probably like, I'm like, okay, I'm gonna be in the air.

2085
02:19:55.84 --> 02:19:56.84

2086
02:19:56.84 --> 02:19:58.84
Well, I'm going to be in the air.

02:20:12.84 --> 02:20:13.84
Thanks for swing the by the, yeah.

2097
02:20:13.84 --> 02:20:14.84
Yeah.

2098
02:20:14.84 --> 02:20:16.84
You're coming, get me to roll though.

2099
02:20:16.84 --> 02:20:17.84
Unfortunately.

2100
02:20:17.84 --> 02:20:22.60
But is that I mean I know we know and you know so as like okay

2101
02:20:22.60 --> 02:20:27.64
I'm Dan Bat I'm coming in I see Jocca for the first time he's over there rolling with Andy and Taylor by the way

2102
02:20:27.64 --> 02:20:31.64
Yeah, and I'm over here doing no ghee a little bit early in the jujitsu career

2103
02:20:31.64 --> 02:20:36.24
You know Jocca with their training hardcore do I walk over there and try to roll with Jocca?

2104
02:20:36.24 --> 02:20:40.16
That's the question. Yeah. Well some people do some people though for us like yeah

2105
02:20:40.16 --> 02:20:45.32
If I would ask you that you be like yeah come wrong. Yeah, but like I said it from Dan Bat's my first time

2106
02:20:45.32 --> 02:20:53.82
At victory I see you over there. Do I do that? Yeah, maybe I overestimated the I feel like I know him pretty well

2107
02:20:53.82 --> 02:20:55.32
Yeah, yeah

2108
02:20:55.32 --> 02:20:58.42
He probably feels like he knows us real well

2109
02:20:58.42 --> 02:21:02.46
What beef he came up he was like my other friend Anthony. He was like oh yeah that guy

2110
02:21:02.46 --> 02:21:04.46
He's he's one farm buffalo

2111
02:21:04.46 --> 02:21:09.96
Jiu Jitsu and all this stuff his name's Dan. I was like yeah cool Dan and meet him. I'll take a damn cuz I didn't drive in

2112
02:21:09.96 --> 02:21:15.54
Make the connection that he's Dan Bat. Yeah, just say it's Dan Bat cuz every all know we don't Dan Bat from from the beginning

2113
02:21:15.54 --> 02:21:19.22
There's out for whatever maybe I'm not looking at his pictures close enough for whatever, but oh

2114
02:21:19.22 --> 02:21:22.52
Yeah, when you were like yeah Dan Bat I was like oh this is Dan Bat

2115
02:21:22.52 --> 02:21:24.32
And then I'm like cruising with him, you know

2116
02:21:24.32 --> 02:21:26.32
Like he's a great check

2117
02:21:27.04 --> 02:21:32.40
Dan Bat is on the path but still yeah way on the path

2118
02:21:32.40 --> 02:21:40.32
He's a way of the path on the path yeah big time and so are we and we can talk about some stuff to help support the path and

2119
02:21:41.60 --> 02:21:44.32
Support you all right first one talk about origin

2120
02:21:44.80 --> 02:21:50.08
So origin origin is the company the company. This is where you get your gear when you're on your Getsu

2121
02:21:50.08 --> 02:21:53.76
Okay, we're just said it. It's real quick. So one you take you Jitsu you need a gear

2122
02:21:54.08 --> 02:21:57.28
Cuz you're doing gear and no gear. Yes. That's a good idea

2123
02:21:57.28 --> 02:22:04.08
I'm gonna be mad at you if you just do key or if you just do no key. Did you see everyone's gonna be mad at you?

2124
02:22:04.08 --> 02:22:10.84
No one's gonna be mad at you, but as a strong recommendation to both yeah, so when you do both you can need a key

2125
02:22:12.40 --> 02:22:15.84
Origin gear is why you get an origin gear. No other gear. Don't get any more

2126
02:22:15.84 --> 02:22:20.72
Deity other gear. You don't have to. No. I have other gears from before or you still have yeah

2127
02:22:20.72 --> 02:22:23.28
Well, they're in my lunch room in fact. I got scolded from my wife

2128
02:22:23.60 --> 02:22:26.16
Why are those gears up there? They're been up there for a while

2129
02:22:26.16 --> 02:22:28.88
Your wife's in the game. She's a game rid of them. No, yeah

2130
02:22:30.16 --> 02:22:33.32
You're not gonna wear them. You're legitimately not gonna wear it

2131
02:22:34.32 --> 02:22:39.92
There's no point to have them. Yeah. It's true good. Good. Well. Yeah, yeah good will or even you don't bring it to

2132
02:22:40.32 --> 02:22:43.76
I don't know. You know, it's good to bring it to your academy and then they can use those as

2133
02:22:44.16 --> 02:22:47.72
Loner keys. Yep. There you go. That's a whole piece. So and

2134
02:22:48.12 --> 02:22:51.12
All these loner geese too that is true so yeah

2135
02:22:51.12 --> 02:22:57.44
And then yeah in the meantime before people get an origin. Yeah, make sense. Yeah, but yeah all made America

2136
02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:03.56
From the beginnings of the birth of the geese is their birth of the geese not really

2137
02:23:03.96 --> 02:23:09.20
Okay, and the will the cotton is grown in America how about that? That's how early on the main in America

2138
02:23:09.72 --> 02:23:10.72
situation

2139
02:23:10.72 --> 02:23:12.72
Commences you know

2140
02:23:12.72 --> 02:23:14.72
all made America and by

2141
02:23:14.72 --> 02:23:17.72
Pete and his team

2142
02:23:17.72 --> 02:23:22.72
Who know about jiu jitsu black belt in jiu jitsu in the game of jiu jitsu for day one

2143
02:23:23.64 --> 02:23:28.44
So he knows all about it make the connection that's why that's why they're the best geese over all right there

2144
02:23:28.44 --> 02:23:36.52
Boom that's it they also make rash cards as well. So I'll get no geek boom key rash card rash cards and you can all kinds of stuff on there too t-shirts

2145
02:23:38.20 --> 02:23:40.20
They may have shorts now

2146
02:23:40.20 --> 02:23:42.20
Do you have a pair of the shorts yet?

2147
02:23:42.20 --> 02:23:44.20
I don't either but I'm gonna get me

2148
02:23:44.20 --> 02:23:51.000
You know what I'm just I was gonna like send both of them a text a group text a group

2149
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:54.04
To be like hey, I'm looking outside the door

2150
02:23:54.44 --> 02:23:59.72
You know I mean like I'm getting other mail no shorts, but then again origin the emerging camps coming up

2151
02:23:59.72 --> 02:24:03.64
I'm sure it's the thing where the boom and actually that makes more sense less packing there

2152
02:24:03.96 --> 02:24:07.14
Okay, I'm saying but I'm not happy about it. I'm you know

2153
02:24:07.14 --> 02:24:09.48
I'm with you know, I'm not happy about it

2154
02:24:09.48 --> 02:24:15.08
So yeah some other stuff then then just jiu jitsu stuff. Yes, I'm on jiu jitsu

2155
02:24:15.08 --> 02:24:18.36
Yeah, and and really the shorts are starting to get into like

2156
02:24:18.84 --> 02:24:21.16
Because they're not even they're not for training

2157
02:24:21.16 --> 02:24:27.56
There's just for straight-up wearing just for wearing around plus there's supplements on there too

2158
02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
We got joint warfare

2159
02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:34.12
Which is good for your joints. Sure. We got

2160
02:24:34.12 --> 02:24:40.04
Crill oil which is also good for your joints was that did was at this supplement that pushed you over the edge

2161
02:24:40.12 --> 02:24:43.56
What do you know over the edge that got you to start using supplements? Crill oil?

2162
02:24:44.92 --> 02:24:48.36
Yes, okay, I thought and that was like a what do you call it?

2163
02:24:48.36 --> 02:24:50.84
It was like a gateway supplement. Yeah, what actually you know what?

2164
02:24:50.84 --> 02:24:55.80
I don't know if that in and of itself was the gateway so I think you were essentially the influence gateway

2165
02:24:57.16 --> 02:25:01.32
Entity if you will right, but that was the one where you when you started taking it and you were like oh

2166
02:25:01.32 --> 02:25:05.40
This actually works and so I'm gonna continue and then with then when I was saying you know what?

2167
02:25:05.40 --> 02:25:08.28
I got something called joint warfare and then you're like almost our crackdown

2168
02:25:08.28 --> 02:25:11.40
So that's it and then you got your army old up, but now you're a believer

2169
02:25:11.40 --> 02:25:16.84
Well and the thing about both of those things is cake glucose immune conjuritan is in joint warfare

2170
02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:18.84
Right, it has other other good stuff

2171
02:25:18.84 --> 02:25:23.64
It's like that but that was kind of humanity has in there which is actually as big of a deal as the other two things that you just mentioned

2172
02:25:23.64 --> 02:25:24.68
Yeah, as it turns out

2173
02:25:24.68 --> 02:25:26.76
Yeah, I didn't know that said the time so you're like yeah

2174
02:25:26.76 --> 02:25:32.36
Joint warfare cruel oil all this stuff and these are things that I heard about before and I was like cool, but you know

2175
02:25:32.36 --> 02:25:36.76
And I don't need to take supplements. You just you know, you right and on the stuff

2176
02:25:37.56 --> 02:25:39.08
We wouldn't have multiple tone

2177
02:25:39.08 --> 02:25:40.44
That's what we took more of

2178
02:25:41.72 --> 02:25:44.36
Anyways, you got that you got discipline which is good for

2179
02:25:45.24 --> 02:25:51.48
Just good for mission life mission getting after it yeah Brian was explaining to me

2180
02:25:51.48 --> 02:25:56.44
That it helps you a look. I'm gonna get terminology wrong

2181
02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.40
But because I'm doing this off of memory, but it's like

2182
02:25:59.96 --> 02:26:05.24
Adaptedions or something basically it helps you manage any stress that comes to you. Look at you

2183
02:26:05.24 --> 02:26:06.20
I'm saying

2184
02:26:06.20 --> 02:26:07.56
Apped you like that

2185
02:26:08.84 --> 02:26:10.84
It helps you manage stress

2186
02:26:11.24 --> 02:26:16.04
And that goes for like physical and mental stress. So remember when I was telling you yeah

2187
02:26:16.04 --> 02:26:19.72
Like last time was time with Dean or whatever when I was saying when I took the three scoops

2188
02:26:19.72 --> 02:26:21.72
I felt like I could just do with stuff

2189
02:26:21.72 --> 02:26:24.20
Oh yeah, that's what it was my patient

2190
02:26:24.20 --> 02:26:26.20
That's been it's wearing the house

2191
02:26:28.20 --> 02:26:33.32
You know, after the ginger were in the house and they're in the house so Brian totally explained it so I'll look all that makes sense

2192
02:26:33.72 --> 02:26:38.60
Yeah, I'm saying see that's a little subtle. I think that that's a little subtle thing that you know how it's like yeah

2193
02:26:38.60 --> 02:26:43.40
I can remember words quicker and like all this stuff good, man good and I'd rather have the adapt

2194
02:26:43.72 --> 02:26:49.16
Yes, I hear another thing I'd rather or not I'm saying that's part that I think anyway

2195
02:26:49.16 --> 02:26:55.08
We all might kind of disregard you know, you know, it's basically the opposite of having

2196
02:26:55.64 --> 02:26:59.80
You know when you're like what do you call it when you're irritable? You know that yeah, okay?

2197
02:26:59.96 --> 02:27:04.52
So consider when you're irritable not I'm not gonna say you're gonna behave a certain way some people do though when they're irritable

2198
02:27:04.52 --> 02:27:06.52
They're shorter they're shorter temper

2199
02:27:06.92 --> 02:27:08.60
They you know when things don't go their way

2200
02:27:08.60 --> 02:27:13.64
You know when I I consider that to be a weakness yes, yeah, so consider that to be a week

2201
02:27:13.64 --> 02:27:16.36
Okay, so consider that like when I snap at someone

2202
02:27:16.36 --> 02:27:22.84
You know which I would say I like rarely snap someone yeah because I consider I don't know when I started thinking that way

2203
02:27:23.40 --> 02:27:29.16
Yeah, like hey just snapping at someone is just when if I snap at you brother's per you did some really

2204
02:27:29.32 --> 02:27:33.16
Jacked up or maybe you're just super duper irritable

2205
02:27:33.16 --> 02:27:38.92
Yeah, I don't know in general. I think you're right though. Yeah, I'm literally sitting here trying to figure out the last time

2206
02:27:38.92 --> 02:27:40.68
I felt

2207
02:27:40.68 --> 02:27:45.08
Legitimately we know it'll be something you know what bothers me

2208
02:27:45.08 --> 02:27:49.96
It bothers me if I'm trying to work and people want to talk to me about stuff

2209
02:27:50.44 --> 02:27:55.80
So this is more of a home life scenario and normally I schedule my situations that

2210
02:27:56.36 --> 02:27:58.36
Everyone's asleep or I'm

2211
02:27:59.08 --> 02:28:05.16
Separated but sometimes people want to interact and and when I'm doing my work, you know

2212
02:28:05.72 --> 02:28:10.76
And I have a somewhere with with my wife where you know you've seen the movie the shining right?

2213
02:28:10.76 --> 02:28:13.56
Yes, I'll be I'll be sitting there and I'll be working. I'm like

2214
02:28:13.56 --> 02:28:22.44
When you hear this noise when you hear that it means I'm typing that is my typewriter

2215
02:28:24.04 --> 02:28:29.88
And that means I'm trying to work and if you hear me barking they don't and she starts laughing

2216
02:28:29.88 --> 02:28:35.88
So I thought I thought a little Jack Nicholson sure and she realizes that I'm trying to do what I do

2217
02:28:36.20 --> 02:28:42.76
Well, I will say that that's podcast prep right books whatever. Yeah, fully you get down and I do it

2218
02:28:42.76 --> 02:28:49.56
But that's not really you snapping though is no no no friendly version of fun. Hey, it is my way

2219
02:28:50.92 --> 02:28:52.12
of

2220
02:28:52.12 --> 02:28:53.32
of

2221
02:28:53.32 --> 02:28:55.32
Let's say

2222
02:28:55.72 --> 02:29:04.20
projecting my frustration into a good positive humorous thing that releases the tension and gets the message across remember earlier

2223
02:29:04.20 --> 02:29:08.04
Today we were talking about getting the message across without doing collateral damage. Yes

2224
02:29:08.04 --> 02:29:13.32
Well, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah, so I just don't want a little bit of that here. This

2225
02:29:14.20 --> 02:29:17.96
Well, that actually that's good because man, I'll suck in I don't want to deviate too much but

2226
02:29:18.28 --> 02:29:21.64
What do you mean we're talking about completely different stuff that we deviate it so far

2227
02:29:21.64 --> 02:29:27.08
There's not even I don't know where we came from it has to do with getting the message across right you can have a greatest info in the world

2228
02:29:27.48 --> 02:29:32.92
most important info in the world, but if you can't get it across right so it's like yeah, I'm in for super important

2229
02:29:32.92 --> 02:29:40.68
Potentially but here's the thing about information and what you say and why you say it's like all it's good

2230
02:29:40.68 --> 02:29:46.76
It has to land, you know, so you can start throwing out info and but if it doesn't land you might as well not have said nothing

2231
02:29:46.76 --> 02:29:54.04
Okay, so what just hopefully you're pended whatever you were talking about earlier with the with the discipline you were talking about this

2232
02:29:54.04 --> 02:29:56.04
Oh, yeah, that's the jins. Okay

2233
02:29:56.04 --> 02:29:59.56
Yeah, all the things we're all the different subject. Now we'll go back to the how to that land

2234
02:29:59.56 --> 02:30:05.80
Amen each you're talking about you being talking about adaptive you know this stuff. Okay. I'll actually back to the point back

2235
02:30:05.80 --> 02:30:09.64
The way okay, so the adaptions it's the opposite of being irritable

2236
02:30:10.04 --> 02:30:15.64
That's what I felt and I think when we think about like discipline and you know could neutral pay hell brain health all this stuff

2237
02:30:16.04 --> 02:30:20.20
We think about like remembering words and being sharper and quicker, but we don't think about like

2238
02:30:20.76 --> 02:30:25.64
The opposite of being irritable when it I don't know if there's is there a word for the opposite of irritable

2239
02:30:25.64 --> 02:30:32.20
Because it's not the kind oh like it's just okay. I'm cruising. It's not that feeling. It's more like the opposite of

2240
02:30:32.20 --> 02:30:34.20
I keep cruising

2241
02:30:35.56 --> 02:30:40.12
All right speaking of information. Why don't you give us an information about mocks so we can move on okay? Well

2242
02:30:40.20 --> 02:30:44.84
Take the don't don't don't slip on the discipline. Anyway. Okay. Yeah, don't slip on that. Okay, here's mock

2243
02:30:44.84 --> 02:30:49.40
Here's mock because you'll be the opposite of irritable. That's a good tagline. We should use that

2244
02:30:49.40 --> 02:30:54.52
Obviously, it would be irritable. Yeah, man. It works. It works for me. Yeah, keep in mind when you're irritable

2245
02:30:54.52 --> 02:31:00.44
That's not a good feeling. No most of us if we don't get like in a sleep or or sometimes

2246
02:31:00.44 --> 02:31:04.36
Well, I guess it depends on who you're but some people when they get angry that's what that is

2247
02:31:04.52 --> 02:31:09.88
So that is not a good feeling. If you'll opposite of that it is a good feeling. Seems same check just simple math

2248
02:31:10.20 --> 02:31:12.44
Anyway, mock. Okay, mock

2249
02:31:13.40 --> 02:31:15.40
If you want some additional protein

2250
02:31:16.12 --> 02:31:21.72
This is a good way to get it. Can you imagine you remember how you was talking about if he's had seen movies

2251
02:31:21.72 --> 02:31:29.32
While he was in prison camp, you would have tried to break out. Yeah, if you were in that situation and you had

2252
02:31:29.88 --> 02:31:31.88
Had mock before you

2253
02:31:32.68 --> 02:31:35.80
That would be horrible because you'd be thinking about not only

2254
02:31:36.52 --> 02:31:43.08
How just about mock is it how good is how tasty is it's like you're stuck there you can't have it

2255
02:31:43.08 --> 02:31:45.08
That happened to me yesterday when I was on my trip

2256
02:31:45.64 --> 02:31:50.52
Dang it didn't bring the mock. I didn't bring mock and I need to figure that situation out a little bit better

2257
02:31:50.52 --> 02:31:56.04
But because that's it just and I do I do some I've branched out a little bit

2258
02:31:56.04 --> 02:32:02.76
I normally always did two scoops of mock in big glass of milk and now I'm kind of doing little hitters

2259
02:32:03.80 --> 02:32:06.52
Like little hitters like little hitters

2260
02:32:06.52 --> 02:32:11.96
Well, they're still they're still one full scoop. I haven't gone below. I haven't done just like a straight-up shot

2261
02:32:12.60 --> 02:32:19.48
Yeah, but I'm been doing little hitters just one just one scoop and what's the philosophy behind the you know like what you know

2262
02:32:19.48 --> 02:32:26.04
I cuz I I'm so full when I get done with mock like this morning when I got home since I didn't have mock on my trip

2263
02:32:26.04 --> 02:32:27.24
When I got home

2264
02:32:27.24 --> 02:32:33.88
Before I started record before I started prepping for the podcast I had a little hitter of mock

2265
02:32:34.04 --> 02:32:38.36
Which I by the way took hitter that whole concept of using the word hitter from the oven

2266
02:32:40.76 --> 02:32:45.96
So yeah, I think he uses it for everything like things can just be a hitter

2267
02:32:45.96 --> 02:32:51.32
I have a little hitter a little one scoop hitter yeah, yeah, that's right there

2268
02:32:51.72 --> 02:32:53.88
Boom there you go that is

2269
02:32:54.20 --> 02:32:59.80
No, I don't want to say that's odd so it's the opposite. There's something you have to be careful of if you think in the future

2270
02:33:00.04 --> 02:33:02.04
You may be completely

2271
02:33:02.28 --> 02:33:06.20
In a situation where you can't have mock maybe it's better to never have it

2272
02:33:06.68 --> 02:33:11.88
Yeah, so you don't even always think about it for you like you can't you can't miss what you don't know

2273
02:33:12.04 --> 02:33:14.68
Yeah, yeah, it's just yeah

2274
02:33:14.68 --> 02:33:20.04
Yeah, I'm going I'm going the opposite direction. I'm going I'm making them bigger just bigger like last

2275
02:33:20.04 --> 02:33:23.88
They you know is weird so I can I went to sleep kind of early which is like

2276
02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:29.72
I'm not you know some people that they prefer to go sleep hungry because it's like you know

2277
02:33:29.80 --> 02:33:32.68
Whatever their philosophy. I'd prefer not to go sleep hungry

2278
02:33:32.84 --> 02:33:37.56
So I had a dinner and then I stayed up a couple hours and I'm like oh I either eat right now

2279
02:33:37.56 --> 02:33:41.56
I'm not really hungry or risk being hungry at some point very soon

2280
02:33:41.56 --> 02:33:44.20
So what I did is you will in prison. Yeah, bro

2281
02:33:44.92 --> 02:33:51.56
No, I would not work out for me for sure. Yeah, and the last I take the mock three scoops. Oh

2282
02:33:52.04 --> 02:33:57.64
God peanut butter man. I don't know why I mean I do know why two peanut butter scoops to admit to the mint

2283
02:33:57.64 --> 02:34:04.44
From I'm total double dipping out you're going crazy. Yeah. I don't know it just the thing is I know how I don't do

2284
02:34:04.44 --> 02:34:06.92
Like the sound of that. Yeah, but it's good for them

2285
02:34:06.92 --> 02:34:13.32
They taste that sounds it's good to sound good nonetheless, but

2286
02:34:14.20 --> 02:34:18.52
I've been doing it and it's the kind of words like what I already know how it tastes like what I would

2287
02:34:18.52 --> 02:34:23.96
I'm not even do that okay? Well, like I've said it and you actually I said don't cross the streams like ghostbusters

2288
02:34:23.96 --> 02:34:28.12
And you said that's how they won. Yes, so maybe you got across the peanut butter in the mint

2289
02:34:28.12 --> 02:34:31.56
I don't know I'm not I don't you think I'm gonna try it all right? That's up to you

2290
02:34:31.56 --> 02:34:36.04
And maybe it's one of those things if I try it then I'll have to carry around both types all the time for the rest of my life

2291
02:34:36.04 --> 02:34:38.92
Or you can mix them that one you pour you mix them up

2292
02:34:39.72 --> 02:34:44.28
Right, that's up to you anyway. Hey, mok how you want to mok up bulk up

2293
02:34:44.84 --> 02:34:48.12
That's that's good right that rhymes yeah, mok a bucket anyway, so

2294
02:34:48.76 --> 02:34:55.32
So I so I hit it. It's the big you know, or oh you got a hitter no I hit it so technically it may be was a hitter

2295
02:34:55.32 --> 02:34:56.92
But it was you

2296
02:34:57.48 --> 02:34:58.52
Founder

2297
02:34:58.52 --> 02:34:59.80
Oh, you got one of those big

2298
02:34:59.80 --> 02:35:05.40
The huge one pound did it no problem. I'm just mok is gonna consume it the immersion camp you think I

2299
02:35:06.60 --> 02:35:13.08
Think it's gonna be a lot well considered myself alone. I mean man. I'm on the mok train big times. That's every day

2300
02:35:13.64 --> 02:35:20.12
Yeah, well how many scoops while we're at immersion camp how many scoops of mok will you consume per day? Well pretty

2301
02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.60
I don't know I just say six minimum because every game will you figure

2302
02:35:24.60 --> 02:35:30.60
I'm just saying crazy well, you know as much juice is going on yeah six two scoops

2303
02:35:30.60 --> 02:35:33.88
I don't want to three I can see maybe doing four for me

2304
02:35:34.28 --> 02:35:38.28
Maybe two in the morning maybe two in the afternoon maybe maybe every one more hitter

2305
02:35:40.28 --> 02:35:41.64
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

2306
02:35:41.64 --> 02:35:45.24
Nonetheless that's small good good protein and it tastes good see and that's the thing

2307
02:35:45.24 --> 02:35:49.08
Well if you do it as like someone who's texting me. Oh, can you do it as a meal replacement?

2308
02:35:49.08 --> 02:35:52.28
Can you do this meal for me and the day before I got that text

2309
02:35:52.28 --> 02:35:58.92
Pete was saying I said something I forgot what it was and he said ha ha yeah, you can use it as a meal replace

2310
02:35:58.92 --> 02:36:00.92
Oh yeah breakfast mok and dinner

2311
02:36:02.92 --> 02:36:08.92
I think that's one other reasons why I was texting Pete and then so yeah, so when you do it as a meal replacement

2312
02:36:09.40 --> 02:36:11.40
It's like

2313
02:36:11.40 --> 02:36:13.80
It's not the meal. It's like a dessert as a meal

2314
02:36:13.80 --> 02:36:15.40
Yeah, it's both you've seen

2315
02:36:15.40 --> 02:36:17.40
It's just like the treat you look forward to

2316
02:36:17.96 --> 02:36:19.96
Unless good to go get all this at

2317
02:36:19.96 --> 02:36:21.96
Origin main

2318
02:36:22.52 --> 02:36:26.76
dot com as we can get all this stuff cool website check

2319
02:36:26.76 --> 02:36:30.36
I would talk about the immersion camp, but it's sold out bummer

2320
02:36:30.84 --> 02:36:33.08
Here's the thing to I'll suck the Andy Burke

2321
02:36:35.08 --> 02:36:37.08
Not Dave Burke

2322
02:36:37.08 --> 02:36:44.44
Good deal Dave good deal Dave not good deal Dave Andy Burke no relation and we're talking about like okay

2323
02:36:44.44 --> 02:36:48.12
So it's one thing to be like hey, we're getting kind of full. We'll just get more mats, but then we're now

2324
02:36:48.12 --> 02:36:53.64
We're talking about the camp. Yeah, so it's we're doer full. Yeah, we're full. Yeah, we're full. Yeah, can't do it

2325
02:36:54.12 --> 02:36:57.08
Unless maybe like you'd be bringing your tent or something like that

2326
02:36:57.80 --> 02:37:04.36
Maybe no less sold out. So yeah, maybe next year. There it is all origin stuff good way to support as well

2327
02:37:04.92 --> 02:37:06.52
shifting gears

2328
02:37:06.52 --> 02:37:12.28
Jocco as a store. It's called jocco store. So you let it jocco store dot com. This is where you can get

2329
02:37:13.72 --> 02:37:15.72
shirts

2330
02:37:15.72 --> 02:37:20.12
hoodies tank tops some rash guards more rash guards

2331
02:37:21.24 --> 02:37:29.32
Good way to support like I said this is where if you want to represent discipline equals freedom just the general concepts and how should I say

2332
02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:35.48
philosophies of the game overall deaf core yeah

2333
02:37:37.56 --> 02:37:41.56
Overall does overall if you want to represent that's where you get it jocco store

2334
02:37:41.56 --> 02:37:46.84
dot com got some new designs on there. I was I was gonna send out like email to everybody

2335
02:37:47.40 --> 02:37:51.48
Like that sign up for the email list. It's been a few months. So I'm as well

2336
02:37:51.48 --> 02:37:56.52
So I'll probably send out something just to indicate hey, we got some new stuff boom. There it is. If you want it

2337
02:37:56.76 --> 02:38:01.40
Yeah, if you want to boom because a lot of times it's like it's not like people are just gonna be going jocco store every day

2338
02:38:01.40 --> 02:38:07.40
Boom boom boom, you know, no, no, you don't put new stuff up very often. Wow, what they do that

2339
02:38:07.40 --> 02:38:09.40
Well, we'll just say there's no

things yeah, but this is yeah, and this is it was funny. It's like you just say it like it's like

2367
02:39:54.28 --> 02:40:00.04
Yeah, it'll be a cool addition to the thing this like what you what you we talked about we explained

2368
02:40:00.04 --> 02:40:02.04
is

2369
02:40:02.04 --> 02:40:04.04
if I would have known this

2370
02:40:04.92 --> 02:40:06.92
It's almost like the secret to life

2371
02:40:08.84 --> 02:40:12.44
It's not true. No, I know I know it's it so

2372
02:40:12.92 --> 02:40:17.24
We'll put it to we get this this means we're not to put it together. Maybe we could do go we do it while we're in Maine or something

2373
02:40:17.80 --> 02:40:20.12
It's not good. I don't want to I don't want to get crazy with it

2374
02:40:20.12 --> 02:40:25.48
I just want to put the word out there. I need a dry erase board. I need to explain it. I'll think through it a couple times and then I'll put it out there

2375
02:40:25.56 --> 02:40:28.04
Because it will help it will definitely help

2376
02:40:28.04 --> 02:40:33.80
Yeah, yeah fully and both both those topics. There's two topics that need to come out

2377
02:40:33.80 --> 02:40:37.88
And I'll discuss both them. We'll put it on the YouTube and then then people can get them

2378
02:40:37.88 --> 02:40:44.52
So it's so subscribe to the YouTube channel for that. It the channel is called jockel podcast and

2379
02:40:46.60 --> 02:40:51.64
Also when I said subscribe that's to the audio you know so YouTube's video the audio is like iTunes

2381
02:40:55.96 --> 02:41:02.52
What in there just in case maybe someone's new to podcasting in general. Okay. You just never know I'm just gonna be quiet

2382
02:41:02.52 --> 02:41:04.52
Just a fly one

2383
02:41:05.64 --> 02:41:07.64
Also also

2384
02:41:08.12 --> 02:41:15.64
On it so on it dot com slash jockel by the way you get 10% off of what what do we get 10% yeah because we so

2385
02:41:16.60 --> 02:41:22.36
Where if you want to vary up you work out. I know I said it before but very we work out kettlebell stuff

2389
02:41:42.36 --> 02:41:45.72
Situation educated keep yourself safe and

2390
02:41:45.72 --> 02:41:54.24
You know boom get the results without all the injuries. Same same also we made a spoken word spoken word

2391
02:41:55.24 --> 02:42:01.80
Album with tracks and it's it's me actually we made it, but it's me talking

2392
02:42:01.80 --> 02:42:05.56
Sure, and it's me just telling you not to be weak today

2393
02:42:05.56 --> 02:42:11.80
But to go do and what you're supposed to do and we're gonna make another one of those working on it now gathering the topics

2394
02:42:11.80 --> 02:42:21.000
So if you have topics for psychological warfare then you can put them on the social media thing and I'll get them

2395
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:25.88
We will assess if they are important topics or if they're important topics you away

2396
02:42:25.88 --> 02:42:31.72
Yes, we'll figure it out so basically if you're struggling not struggling, but yeah, if you're like kind of struggling something

2397
02:42:31.72 --> 02:42:33.72
You have moments of weakness. What is it?

2398
02:42:34.52 --> 02:42:38.52
What's the scenario are you in? What are you weak with yeah my sister used to say?

2399
02:42:38.52 --> 02:42:43.48
White rice is like her weakness

2400
02:42:43.48 --> 02:42:48.52
Oh, I'm saying white rice. I'm gonna make a psychological warfare that says the white rice that you're looking for

2401
02:42:48.52 --> 02:42:55.000
If she was gonna put it today if she was gonna do 100% sugar once it enters your stomach walk away

2402
02:42:56.04 --> 02:43:01.08
Walk away from the white rice now actually that's what you that kind of wood because she said

2403
02:43:01.56 --> 02:43:05.48
Late at night this was long time ago by the way she said late at night

2404
02:43:05.48 --> 02:43:09.000
So yeah, she were to play it and you're like walk away

2405
02:43:09.32 --> 02:43:14.84
She'd be walking away that's all this. See that sounds starts psychological warfare. It's available in iTunes

2406
02:43:14.84 --> 02:43:17.08
Google play and the three platforms blah blah blah blah

2407
02:43:17.48 --> 02:43:24.44
Jocquity that you can get in a can or you can get it in a tea bag and you get both those

2408
02:43:25.24 --> 02:43:31.16
From Amazon that's where they're at so if you want to be able to deadlift

2409
02:43:31.16 --> 02:43:37.32
No less than 8,000 pounds 100% guaranteed all you have to do is drink chocolate

2410
02:43:37.32 --> 02:43:40.04
You don't have to work out even you don't even have to lift weights

2411
02:43:40.20 --> 02:43:44.20
You just drink it and then you can deadlift 8,000 pounds. Don't worry. It's no problem

2412
02:43:46.04 --> 02:43:48.28
Books yeah, I wrote some books

2413
02:43:49.32 --> 02:43:51.88
wrote some kid books actually way of the worry kid

2414
02:43:51.88 --> 02:43:58.32
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's the first one and way of the is this okay the second one is marks miss you sexy

2415
02:43:58.32 --> 02:44:03.36
But is it called way of the warrior kid mark marks miss you? I'm not sure let's look at the cover

2416
02:44:03.36 --> 02:44:06.08
It does say way of the warrior kid marks mission

2417
02:44:06.08 --> 02:44:12.000
So it's it's way of the warrior kid marks mission. Yeah, I think I should put a big one and two on them

2418
02:44:12.08 --> 02:44:16.68
So that's more clear. Yeah, the next book the next one that comes out it will say three on it

2419
02:44:16.68 --> 02:44:24.24
Yeah, good idea because they are kind of essentially the whole story and even the lessons by the way are they built on a larger first

2420
02:44:24.24 --> 02:44:29.44
Same saying so like the first one the lessons and the struggles and the problems whatever are

2421
02:44:30.08 --> 02:44:33.60
Nine-year-old problems right? I mean give her take you know, they're like a certain age

2422
02:44:33.60 --> 02:44:34.80
Ten-year-old type

2423
02:44:34.80 --> 02:44:38.24
Problems and then they ask so they get a little bit more sophisticated

2424
02:44:38.24 --> 02:44:43.20
You know and the next little more and more so it's kind of chronological and not to mention the story as well

2425
02:44:43.20 --> 02:44:44.70
So it makes makes it

2426
02:44:44.70 --> 02:44:48.08
Yeah, do it that way and that's if you want your kids to

2427
02:44:49.28 --> 02:44:51.28
Actually get after it straight up

2428
02:44:51.28 --> 02:44:57.76
I get I get the best feedback from those bucks. Yeah, so yeah, I could see why I mean shoot

2429
02:44:57.76 --> 02:44:59.84
I'm one of those people who's giving me the feedback

2430
02:44:59.84 --> 02:45:01.60
It's very well the

2431
02:45:02.16 --> 02:45:04.96
My daughter is a book. Yeah as a book

2432
02:45:05.36 --> 02:45:08.000
What do you call critic yeah

2433
02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Someone who has

2434
02:45:11.20 --> 02:45:16.56
Red a book before you know, it's good. It's good. I have it as like just an up running theme

2435
02:45:16.56 --> 02:45:22.32
You know like I just keep reading the book just keep reading both of them yeah, so it becomes the ethos

2436
02:45:22.32 --> 02:45:26.40
That's why your daughter which I primarily see your daughter more she's like, you know

2437
02:45:26.40 --> 02:45:30.20
She gets after it. Yeah, she does get it after it does it

2438
02:45:30.20 --> 02:45:33.92
Constantly work though, man. Yeah, of course. This is a big health course huge health. Oh, bye

2439
02:45:34.56 --> 02:45:38.72
Also discipline equals freedom field manual

2440
02:45:39.84 --> 02:45:41.84
Who would have thought

2441
02:45:41.84 --> 02:45:51.04
That that book would be popular that people would be into it. That's what's cool. Yeah, you wouldn't think see most people don't think there's people that

2442
02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:57.12
Really want to get after it. Yeah, and know but they do yeah, and they don't know how yeah

2443
02:45:57.12 --> 02:46:02.72
When you think about it's gonna start to it kind of makes sense really when you just like okay, so it's field manual

2444
02:46:02.72 --> 02:46:06.80
Right you have a manual a manual because that's a lot of times that's why people don't do stuff

2445
02:46:06.80 --> 02:46:12.08
I don't know how to do it. They don't know how and if I do stuff and then I got to look into it and I keep and looking into

2446
02:46:12.08 --> 02:46:15.20
I wish I just had a manual. I wish I had a manual for life. How about that?

2447
02:46:15.20 --> 02:46:21.36
I wish I had a manual for parenting. I wish I had a manual for life. I had a manual for you know a bunch of other stuff

2448
02:46:21.68 --> 02:46:26.08
But if you want to get after it whatever you want to call it you got a manual

2449
02:46:26.40 --> 02:46:31.44
You want to stay disciplined and you want freedom directly from that discipline boom you got a manual right here

2450
02:46:31.44 --> 02:46:32.64
There you go

2451
02:46:32.64 --> 02:46:41.68
Also extreme ownership which is the first book that I wrote with my brother-lave babbin it takes the combat principles that we learned on the battlefield and

2452
02:46:42.32 --> 02:46:44.08
teaches you and

2453
02:46:44.08 --> 02:46:48.96
Show's you how you can apply them to your business and your life and then we got a follow on book to that coming out September 25th

2454
02:46:48.96 --> 02:46:54.48
The dichotomy leadership you can pre-order it right now so that way the publishers who

2455
02:46:56.08 --> 02:47:01.20
Are pessimistic that's that's how publishers aren't they're just pessimistic because for them

2456
02:47:01.20 --> 02:47:04.64
They don't really care if you get if you don't get the book right when it comes out

2457
02:47:04.64 --> 02:47:08.96
They're gonna make their their money either way, but when the when the book comes out and you

2458
02:47:08.96 --> 02:47:15.60
Orgret the day it comes out and then it takes nine days to get to you cuz because they had a reprintum because they ran out

2459
02:47:16.08 --> 02:47:19.36
But I guess they're cons- I shouldn't say they're conservative

2460
02:47:19.68 --> 02:47:21.68
They're being all conservative

2461
02:47:21.68 --> 02:47:27.12
You know I'm just not sure and we don't want to spend a money on money on storage if these things and then you're gonna have to wait to get your copies

2462
02:47:27.12 --> 02:47:29.12
don't do that you can pre-order

2463
02:47:29.12 --> 02:47:34.72
