[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 43 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:11] All the lads have gone out to play at being soldiers far away.
[00:00:17] They won't be back for many a day and some won't be back any morning.
[00:00:24] All the lasses who laughing were when hearts were light and lads were here.
[00:00:30] They go sad-eyed wandering hither in there.
[00:00:34] They pray and watch for the morning.
[00:00:39] Every house has its vacant bed.
[00:00:43] Every night when sounds are dead, some woman yearns for the pillowed head of him who marched
[00:00:50] out in the morning.
[00:00:53] Of all the lads who've gone out to play, there's some or a turn and some who will stay.
[00:01:01] There's some will be back most any day.
[00:01:06] But some won't wake up in the morning.
[00:01:12] Good evening echo.
[00:01:14] Good evening.
[00:01:16] That poem right there is called the lads away and it's from a book called The
[00:01:23] Glory of the Trenches.
[00:01:26] That corneams be Dawson.
[00:01:29] And actually got this book in original copy of this book from a trooper from Jesse.
[00:01:39] Trooper up from Canada and he sent me this book and like I said it's the actual first
[00:01:42] printing beautiful copy and it has that smell.
[00:01:47] The old book must be smell.
[00:01:54] It's one of those books where you can actually smell the age and you can smell the lessons
[00:01:57] learned and you can smell the wisdom inside of it.
[00:02:03] It's a different view.
[00:02:04] It's a different feel and I found it to be very fascinating.
[00:02:12] The intro to the book is actually written by Dawson's father.
[00:02:18] So the intro to the book, Dawson is the guy that wrote the book, Cunning's B. Dawson is
[00:02:22] the guy that wrote the book.
[00:02:23] Well his dad wrote the intro to the book and he kind of kicks it off and here's some
[00:02:28] of the highlights of that.
[00:02:30] He says I've already stated the conditions under which this book of my sons was produced.
[00:02:36] He was wounded in the end of June 1917 in the fierce struggle before lens.
[00:02:42] He was at once removed to a base hospital later to a military hospital in London there
[00:02:48] was engraved danger of amputation of the right arm, but this was happily avoided.
[00:02:54] As soon as he could use his hand he was commingdeared by the Lord High Commissioner of
[00:02:58] Canada right and important paper detailing the history of the Canadian forces in France
[00:03:03] and flanders.
[00:03:06] He goes on to talk about how they came up with the name of the book and they go through
[00:03:11] a couple different titles and they settle on this title, the glory of the trenches.
[00:03:17] Lastly we decided on the glory of the trenches as the most expressive of his aim.
[00:03:23] He felt that a great deal too much had been said about the squalder, filth, discomfort and
[00:03:30] suffering of the trenches.
[00:03:31] Now clearly that stuff that I've talked about.
[00:03:34] And so this should have tell you that's what I'm talking about.
[00:03:36] This is a different take on World War I.
[00:03:40] Because he's saying look we've heard enough about the squalder that felt this comfort
[00:03:42] I'm going to talk about the glory of the trenches.
[00:03:45] He pointed out that a very popular war book which we were reading had six paragraphs and
[00:03:51] the first 60 pages which described an unpleasant detail, the verminous condition of the men.
[00:03:57] Because if this were the chief thing to be remarked concerning them, he held that it was
[00:04:02] a mistake for a writer to lay too much on the too much stress on the horrors of war.
[00:04:09] The effect was bad physiologically.
[00:04:12] It frightened the parents of soldiers.
[00:04:15] It was equally bad for the enlisted man himself for it created a false impression in his mind.
[00:04:20] We all knew that war was horrible, but as a rule the soldier thought little of his
[00:04:25] future in this lot.
[00:04:29] The real soldier thoughts were concerned with other things.
[00:04:33] He was engaged in spiritual acts and this is what I'm talking about.
[00:04:37] This is a different cut.
[00:04:40] He was accomplishing spiritual purposes as truly as the marker of faith and religion.
[00:04:47] He was moved by spiritual impulses, the evocation of duty, the loyal dependence of
[00:04:54] the comradeship, the spirit of sacrifice, the complete surrender of the body to the will of
[00:05:01] the soul.
[00:05:03] This was the side of war which men needed most to recognize.
[00:05:06] They needed it not only because it was the true side, but because nothing else could
[00:05:11] Kindle and sustain the enduring flame of heroism in men's hearts.
[00:05:16] So he's looking at this, you know, it's called the glory of the trenches.
[00:05:20] This, what happens in the trenches is like a religion, it's like a spiritual thing.
[00:05:26] Which another thing that drew me to this is because, you know, I talk all the time about
[00:05:30] how there's the most beautiful things in war.
[00:05:33] I mean, there's the most horrible things, but there's also these beautiful things.
[00:05:36] And so I can see he's very focused on what those things are.
[00:05:42] While some aired in exhibiting nothing but the brutality of war, others aired by sentimentizing
[00:05:49] war.
[00:05:50] He admitted that it was perfectly possible to paint a portrait of a soldier with an aura
[00:05:55] of a saint, but it would not be a representative portrait.
[00:06:00] It would be eclectic, the result of the selection and the elimination.
[00:06:06] So he's saying like on the one hand, you get these books that paint this crazy brutal side
[00:06:11] of war, the other side you get them painting soldiers as saints.
[00:06:15] And neither want to show which I will totally agree with.
[00:06:18] You know, we do have a definite tendency to do that in literature or people that write
[00:06:23] about war, they want to write about, you know, they make everyone look like the best guy ever.
[00:06:26] None of us are.
[00:06:28] None of us are.
[00:06:30] We all have faults.
[00:06:33] Back to the book, the ordinary soldier is an intensely human creature with an endearing
[00:06:38] blend of faults and virtues.
[00:06:41] The romantic method of portraying him not only misrepresented him, but its result is far
[00:06:47] less impressive than a portrait painted in the firm lines of reality.
[00:06:54] So they do all this to make the guy look like a saint, but what's real is actually more
[00:06:59] amazing.
[00:07:00] There's an austere grandeur in the reality of what he is and does which needs no fine
[00:07:07] gilding from the sentimentalist.
[00:07:10] To depict him as Sir Gala had in Holy Armor is a serious offense as to exhibit him
[00:07:17] as a caliban, which is from Shakespeare, from the temp to see like the ultimate bad guy
[00:07:24] in the Shakespeare's play the temp, the tempest, because the total beast.
[00:07:31] So you can't portray the person as Gala had, you can't, you can't, you know, again portraying
[00:07:37] him as a saint.
[00:07:40] Each method fails of truth and all that the soldier needs to be known about him that men
[00:07:45] should honor him is the truth.
[00:07:49] War, a hot new air, which men breathed, produced new energies and forms of thought.
[00:07:58] Men were rediscovering themselves, their own forgotten abilities, the latent abilities
[00:08:03] in all men.
[00:08:06] Bound together in the daily obedience of self-surrender, urged by conditions of their
[00:08:12] task to regard duty as inexorable, confronted by the pitilist destruction of the body.
[00:08:21] They were forced into recognition of the spiritual values of life.
[00:08:26] So faced with what they were facing in World War I and we've talked about that over and
[00:08:30] over again, you're facing death.
[00:08:34] And these guys, these soldiers are forced to look at their spiritual self.
[00:08:41] The common conventional use of the term, these men were not religious.
[00:08:47] There was much in their speech and in their conduct, which would outrage the standards
[00:08:52] of narrow piousism.
[00:08:54] So hey, these guys are not good at issues.
[00:08:57] Traditional creeds and forms of faith had scant authority for them, but they had made their
[00:09:02] own a sure faith then lives in creeds.
[00:09:08] So what they discover on the battlefield is even stronger than what the churches say.
[00:09:19] It was expressed not in words, but acts.
[00:09:24] They had freed their souls from the tyrannies of time and the fear of death.
[00:09:35] They had accomplished indeed that very emancipation of the soul, which is the essential doctrine
[00:09:46] of all religions, which all religions urge on men, but which few men really achieve.
[00:09:54] However, earnestly they profess forms of pious faith.
[00:10:01] That's pretty amazing.
[00:10:02] That's pretty amazing viewpoint.
[00:10:05] What you find out on the battlefield is spiritually stronger than what you find in the
[00:10:13] church.
[00:10:18] Back to the book, this was the true glory of the trenches.
[00:10:24] They were the cavalaries of a new redemption being wrought out from men by soiled unconscious
[00:10:30] Christ.
[00:10:31] That's what the soldiers were.
[00:10:32] Soiled, dirty, unconscious means they don't even know it.
[00:10:36] Christ's.
[00:10:39] And as from that ancient cavalry with its agony of shame, torture and dereliction, their
[00:10:46] flowed a flood of light, which made a new dawn for the world.
[00:10:52] So from these obscure crucifixions, there would come to men a new revelation of the splendor
[00:10:59] of the human soul.
[00:11:02] The true divinity that dwells in man, the God made manifest in the flesh by acts of valor,
[00:11:10] heroism, and self-sacrifice, which transcend the instincts and promptings of the flesh.
[00:11:19] Bear witness to the indestructible life of the Spirit.
[00:11:30] That's heavy.
[00:11:31] That's just, like I said, this viewpoint is I totally understand where it's coming from.
[00:11:41] And it expresses a lot of the things that I think I haven't thought about it to this degree,
[00:11:46] though.
[00:11:47] So calling the death of soldiers on the battlefield, true to fictions.
[00:11:55] And that God is made manifest in the flesh that these guys when they make these sacrifices,
[00:12:01] it's like a glimpse of God.
[00:12:04] These acts of valor and heroism, and it's just very powerful.
[00:12:09] Now that's wrapped up, you know, the intro's longer than that, obviously.
[00:12:14] But now we're going to go to the book itself, which again is written by this soldier,
[00:12:18] Dawson.
[00:12:19] And it actually starts with his training.
[00:12:21] And he was from England, and he lived in Canada.
[00:12:28] He ends up joining the military, because you know, Canada was supporting and helping Britain
[00:12:35] and the war.
[00:12:36] And he actually traveled to New York.
[00:12:38] He lived all over the place.
[00:12:40] And now he's going to boot camp.
[00:12:45] When I had been medically examined, past his fit had dawned a uniform and commenced
[00:12:49] to my training, I learned what the enduring of hardship was.
[00:12:55] No experience on active service has equal the humiliation and severity of those first months
[00:13:01] of soldiering.
[00:13:02] We were sneered at clean, stables, groomed horses, road stripped saddles, stripped saddle
[00:13:08] for 12 miles at the trot, attended lectures, studied till past midnight, and were up
[00:13:13] on the first parade at 6 o'clock.
[00:13:17] No previous civilian efficiency or prominent stood us in any stead.
[00:13:22] We started robbed of all importance.
[00:13:25] I love that.
[00:13:26] We started robbed of all three.
[00:13:27] So you know that thing, you have that to do?
[00:13:29] Yeah, it's gone.
[00:13:30] Just get rid of that.
[00:13:32] And only gained a new importance by our power to hang on and develop a new efficiency as
[00:13:37] soldiers.
[00:13:39] You've heard me say that before, like when I joined the military, that's one of my favorite
[00:13:42] things about us.
[00:13:43] I was like a blank slate.
[00:13:44] Like everything you did in your past, all the stuff you've been through, little trouble
[00:13:48] things you've done, it's all gone.
[00:13:50] What matters now is what you do here.
[00:13:55] When men went sick, they were labeled scrim shankers and struck off the course.
[00:14:02] It was an offense.
[00:14:03] It was an offense to let your body interfere with your duty.
[00:14:09] If it tried to, you must ignore it.
[00:14:12] If a man caught cold in Kingston, what would he not catch in the trenches?
[00:14:17] Very many went down under physical, under the physical ordeal.
[00:14:21] Of the class that started, I don't think more than the third past.
[00:14:24] The lukewarm soldier and the pink tea hero who simply wanted to swank a uniform were eventually
[00:14:31] choked off.
[00:14:33] Who's a test of pluck, even more than of strength or intelligence.
[00:14:38] The same test that a man would be subjected to all the time at the front.
[00:14:44] In a word, it started out the fellows who had guts.
[00:14:50] guts isn't a particularly polite word, but I have come increasingly to appreciate
[00:14:54] its splendid significance.
[00:14:57] The possessor of this much coveted quality is the kind of idiot who, when his legs are
[00:15:04] smitten, will fight upon his stumps.
[00:15:09] And actually, when I read this, I was like, man, there's some archaic term of idiot
[00:15:14] why is he using that word and there was none.
[00:15:17] He means, that's what he means is a guy, and we say this in the sea of training, like
[00:15:22] if you're going to be stupid, you've got to be tough.
[00:15:24] And that's kind of what he's saying, like these guys will go and they will not stop.
[00:15:29] And that's what guts is.
[00:15:32] The Tommy's in that displaying word for the British soldiers, whom we were going to
[00:15:36] command, would be like that.
[00:15:40] If we weren't like it, we wouldn't be any good as officers.
[00:15:43] This artillery school had a violent way of sifting out a man's moral worth.
[00:15:49] You hadn't much concede left by the end of it.
[00:15:54] So I can only imagine, we have a very politically correct military system now and it's
[00:16:00] getting, I can't imagine what these soldiers went through.
[00:16:04] I mean, just unleashing these veterans on them coming out and trying to get them ready
[00:16:09] for war, I bet it was brutal.
[00:16:11] And it sounds like it was brutal.
[00:16:12] And it sounds like it did a very effective job of getting rid of the weak, of making your
[00:16:17] ego completely go away, getting rid of any form of concede that you had.
[00:16:25] Now he continues on the book, but I'm going to move a little bit forward here to where
[00:16:30] he's moving towards the front.
[00:16:32] And we'll go back to the book.
[00:16:33] After trudging about six miles, we arrived at the camp and found that it was out of
[00:16:38] food and that all the tents were occupied.
[00:16:42] We stretched out our sleeping bags on the ground and went to bed's supper list.
[00:16:46] We had no food all day.
[00:16:48] Next morning we were told that we ought to jump on an ammunition lorry if we wanted to go
[00:16:53] any further on our journey.
[00:16:55] Nobody seemed to want us particularly and no one could give us the least information
[00:16:58] as to where our division was.
[00:17:00] It was another lesson if that were needed of our total unimportance.
[00:17:06] So these guys are looking to find whether or not we're supposed to report to say, go
[00:17:09] fight in the war.
[00:17:10] And people are like, I don't know, no time for you.
[00:17:13] Go figure it out.
[00:17:15] While we were raiding on the roadside in Australian brigade of artillery passed by,
[00:17:19] the men's faces were dreary with fatigue.
[00:17:22] The gunners were dismounted and marched as in a trance.
[00:17:27] The harness was muddy.
[00:17:29] The steel rusty, the horses lean and discouraged.
[00:17:34] We understood that they were pulling out from an offensive in which they had received
[00:17:37] a bad cutting up.
[00:17:39] To my overstrain imagination it seemed that the men had the vision of death in their
[00:17:44] eyes.
[00:17:46] Towards the evening, the thunder of the guns had swelled into an ominous roar.
[00:17:52] We passed through villages disfigured by shell fire.
[00:17:55] Civilians became more rare and more aged.
[00:17:59] Cattle disappeared utterly from the landscape.
[00:18:02] Fields were furrowed with abandoned trances in front of which hung in tanglements of wire.
[00:18:08] Mounted orderly splashed along selling roads at an impatient trot.
[00:18:12] Here and there we came across improvised beer vacts of infantry.
[00:18:17] Far away against the horizon towards which we traveled, hunt flares and rockets were going
[00:18:22] up.
[00:18:23] Hopeless stoicism, unordered of a desolation.
[00:18:28] That was my first impression.
[00:18:32] The landscape was getting increasingly muddy.
[00:18:35] It became a sea of mud.
[00:18:37] Dispatch riders on motorbikes traveled whereally their feet dragging to save themselves from
[00:18:42] falling.
[00:18:43] Everything was splashed with filth and corruption.
[00:18:45] One marveled at the cleanliness of the sky.
[00:18:50] Trees were blasted and seemed to be sinking out of sight in this war created slew of
[00:18:56] despondency.
[00:18:58] We came to a brow of a hill in the valley with something that I recognized.
[00:19:02] The last time I had seen it was an etching in a shop window in Newark, New Jersey.
[00:19:07] It was a town from the midst of who's battered ruins a splintered tower to sort against
[00:19:13] the sky.
[00:19:15] Leaning far out from the tower so that it seemed she must drop was a statue of the virgin
[00:19:21] with the Christ in her arms.
[00:19:24] It was a superstition with the French and I remembered that so long as she did not fall,
[00:19:29] things would go well with the allies.
[00:19:32] As we watched a shell screamed over the gaping roofs and a call of smoke going up.
[00:19:40] As we entered the streets, Tommy's more polluted than miners crept out from the skeletons
[00:19:44] of houses.
[00:19:45] They lent listlessly against sagging doorways to watch us pass.
[00:19:50] If we asked for information as to where our division was, they shook their heads stupidly
[00:19:55] to indifferent with weariness to reply.
[00:20:00] For the next three nights we slept by our wits and got our food by foraging.
[00:20:09] So we know, I mean we know this is a world war one, we know it's an absolute nightmare.
[00:20:15] It's an absolute nightmare.
[00:20:17] And you know what was surprising me, you know this guy's an officer and he has no idea
[00:20:21] what he's doing.
[00:20:22] He's just walking around and people are so dispondent from the war that they just
[00:20:28] don't even care.
[00:20:34] Back to the book, there was a headquarters nearby who's battalion was in the line.
[00:20:38] I struck up liaison with its officers and at times went into the crowded tent, which was
[00:20:43] their mess to get warm.
[00:20:45] Runners would come there at all hours of day and night bringing messages from the front.
[00:20:50] They were usually well spent, sometimes they gasped, but they had, but they all had the
[00:20:56] invincible determination to carry on.
[00:21:00] After they delivered their message, they would lie down in the mud and go to sleep like
[00:21:04] dogs.
[00:21:05] The moment the reply was ready, they would lurch to their feet throwing off their weiriness
[00:21:10] as if it were a thing to be conquered and despised.
[00:21:16] Go ahead and read that one again.
[00:21:18] So these guys are dog tired, they'd lay down in the mud, someone is preparing a reply
[00:21:22] for these messages and then the moment the reply was ready, they would lurch to their
[00:21:27] feet throwing off their weiriness as though it were a thing to be conquered and despised.
[00:21:34] I appreciate now as never before, I appreciate it now as never before the lesson of guts
[00:21:41] that I have been taught at Kingston.
[00:21:46] The other side of the town, the ravages of the war were far more marked.
[00:21:52] All the way along the roadside were clumps of little crosses, French, English, German,
[00:21:57] planted above their hurried graves of brave fellows who had fallen.
[00:22:01] Ambulances were picking their way weirly, turning with the last night's toll of wounded.
[00:22:09] We saw newly dead men and horses pulled to one sign who had been caught in the darkness
[00:22:16] by the enemies harassing fire, in places, in places the country had holes the size of
[00:22:22] quarries, where mines had exploded and shells from large caliber guns had detonated.
[00:22:29] Bedlam was raging up front, shells went screaming over us, seeking out victims in the
[00:22:35] back country.
[00:22:37] To have been there by oneself would have been most disturbing but the men about me seemed
[00:22:41] to regard it as perfectly ordinary and normal.
[00:22:46] I steadied myself by their example.
[00:22:54] It's interesting because we're talking about this and it sounds like hell and they're
[00:22:58] not even in the front yet.
[00:23:00] They're not on the front lines.
[00:23:01] This is behind.
[00:23:08] That's something else we were talking about today.
[00:23:10] You can see these guys, whatever pain and suffering they're feeling, they're not showing
[00:23:14] it.
[00:23:15] And he knows he can't show it.
[00:23:18] And that kind of bolsters them all and makes them all stronger.
[00:23:25] Back to the book about seven o'clock as we were resting the evening hate commenced.
[00:23:32] In those days the evening hate was a regular habit with the hunt.
[00:23:40] The new our country better than we did for he had retired from it.
[00:23:44] Every evening he used to search out all communication trenches and likely battery positions
[00:23:50] with any quantity of shells.
[00:23:53] So seven o'clock at night the Germans would just they knew all the positions because they
[00:23:57] had surrendered them so then they would just start dropping bombs, dropping artillery on
[00:24:03] the known positions that they knew they knew of the trenches where they built them.
[00:24:08] His idea was to rob us of our morale.
[00:24:13] I wish he might have seen how abysmal he failed to do it.
[00:24:19] Down our narrow valley like a flight of arrows the shells screamed in whistles.
[00:24:24] Where they struck the ground look like resurrection day with the dead elbowing their way
[00:24:29] into daylight and forcing back the earth from their eyes.
[00:24:36] There were actually many dead men just beneath the surface and as the ground was plowed up
[00:24:42] the smell of corruption became distinctly unpleasant.
[00:24:50] So these guys are buried they're buried in whatever four or five feet of dirt and these
[00:24:55] shells come in and dig them up.
[00:25:01] Only the shells began to go dud.
[00:25:05] So imagine this you're hearing these big explosion and then some shells hit and there's
[00:25:08] no explosion.
[00:25:10] You know what that means?
[00:25:11] It means it's gas.
[00:25:15] We realized that these were gas shells a thin, blueish vapor spread throughout the valley
[00:25:21] and breathing became oppressive.
[00:25:23] Then like stallions kicking in the stalls the heavy guns on the ridge above us opened
[00:25:28] up.
[00:25:29] Now the friendly guns start to open up.
[00:25:31] It was fine to hear them stamping their defiance.
[00:25:34] They made one want to get grips with his aggressors and the brief silence is one could
[00:25:39] hear our chaps laughing.
[00:25:40] So I want you to imagine this is awesome.
[00:25:45] You're getting chilled, you're getting crushed.
[00:25:48] There's dead bodies coming up from the soil.
[00:25:52] There's gas in the air.
[00:25:55] And here we go, in the brief silences, one could hear our chaps laughing.
[00:26:02] The danger seemed to fill them with a wild excitement.
[00:26:05] Every time a shell came near them and missed, they would taunt the unseen huns for
[00:26:11] their purport gunnery, giving what they considered necessary corrections.
[00:26:18] Five minutes more left old cock.
[00:26:21] If you'd only drop 50, you'd get us.
[00:26:24] There he's giving corrections to the guns.
[00:26:28] These men didn't know what fear was or if they did, they kept it to themselves.
[00:26:35] And these were the chaps whom I was to order.
[00:26:39] So we haven't heard too much about that.
[00:26:41] And Tony and Dave talked about it.
[00:26:44] Being a shot at and being really close calls situations and like everyone's laughing
[00:26:50] and it does happen.
[00:26:52] Hold war one, don't hear much about it, but here you go.
[00:26:57] Unbelievable.
[00:26:58] That's part of the way that military, that you do, not just military, but any bad situation.
[00:27:02] You know, a little humor goes a long way.
[00:27:06] A little humor goes a long way.
[00:27:10] Back to the book.
[00:27:11] We entered a trench.
[00:27:12] And this is, by the way, this is, I'm obviously not reading the entire book.
[00:27:16] I'm going to some highlights, so there's a little bit of a skip, you know, time here
[00:27:22] as they move towards the front.
[00:27:25] Back to the book.
[00:27:26] We entered a trench.
[00:27:28] Holds were scooped out in the side of it, just large enough to shelter a man crouching.
[00:27:33] Each hole contained a sleeping soldier who looked as dead as the occupant of a catacom.
[00:27:40] Some of the holes had been blown in, all you saw of the late occupant was a protruding
[00:27:45] arm or leg.
[00:27:48] That best there was a horrid similarity between the dead and the living.
[00:27:53] It seemed that the walls of the trenches had been built out of corpses.
[00:27:57] For one, recognize the uniforms of French and the Huns.
[00:28:06] So you're in this trench, but you're protected somewhat, but you got to dig another hole
[00:28:10] into the wall of the trench.
[00:28:13] And some of those guys get buried and killed and the body's are just there.
[00:28:18] Really, I mean, talk about hell.
[00:28:21] Hell.
[00:28:22] Back to the book.
[00:28:27] The enemy's shelling was growing more intense as was always the way on the zone, so we're
[00:28:33] there at the zone, the battle was on.
[00:28:35] When we were bringing in our, when we were bringing out our wounded.
[00:28:39] The good many of our trenches were directly on filet and if you don't know what that is,
[00:28:43] on filet is like, if you can imagine a line of people and you are shooting down the line
[00:28:49] of people and how much more exposed you are in that situation.
[00:28:55] So picture if I told you to shoot some of these 10 cans and I lined them up in a straight line,
[00:29:00] perpendicular to you, you'd have to aim at each individual one and you might hit it,
[00:29:04] you might not.
[00:29:05] If we put them all in a big line where they're, where they're parallel to you or they're,
[00:29:09] they go down the same gun target line that you have, you can, if you hit one, you might
[00:29:13] hit two, you might hit three, you might hit all of them with one shot.
[00:29:16] And so this is a bad situation to be in.
[00:29:19] You never want to have the enemy, so they're basically on your flank and you're lined
[00:29:23] up for them to shoot at you.
[00:29:24] It's a nightmare.
[00:29:27] Shell's burst just behind the parapet.
[00:29:29] When they didn't burst on it.
[00:29:30] It was about this point in my breaking in that I received a blow to the head and thank God
[00:29:38] for the man who invented the steel helmet so he's getting hit with some shrapnel.
[00:29:43] Night came down and we found that our carriage had no lights.
[00:29:47] It must have been nearing dawn when I was away and again I skipped a little bit but here
[00:29:52] we are obviously using a carriage.
[00:29:55] It must have been nearing dawn when I was awakened by the distant thunder of guns.
[00:30:00] I crouched in my corner, cold and cramped, trying to visualize the terror of it.
[00:30:07] I asked myself whether I was afraid.
[00:30:12] Not of death I told myself but of being afraid.
[00:30:17] Yes, most horribly.
[00:30:19] He was most horribly afraid.
[00:30:21] Not of death they're being wounded.
[00:30:23] He was afraid of being afraid.
[00:30:24] Yeah.
[00:30:25] This first experience in no man's land did away with my last Flabby fear.
[00:30:37] If I was afraid I would show it.
[00:30:40] One is often afraid and he soldier who asserts the contrary may not be a liar but he certainly
[00:30:45] does not speak the truth.
[00:30:49] Physical fear is too deeply rooted to be overcome by any amount of training.
[00:30:52] It remains then to train a man in spiritual pride so that when he fears nobody knows it.
[00:31:04] Cowardous is contagious.
[00:31:06] It has been said that no battalion is braver than its least brave member.
[00:31:14] Military courage therefore is a form of unselfishness.
[00:31:21] It is practiced that it may save the weaker men's lives and uphold their honor.
[00:31:30] The worst thing you can say of a man out on the front is that he doesn't play the game.
[00:31:38] That doesn't have necessity.
[00:31:39] He fails to do his duty.
[00:31:41] Listen to this.
[00:31:42] That doesn't mean he fails to do his duty.
[00:31:45] What it means is that he fails to do a bit more than his duty.
[00:31:51] In a man plays the game he does things which it requires a braver man than himself to
[00:31:58] accomplish.
[00:32:00] He never knows when he's done.
[00:32:01] He acknowledges no limit to his cheerfulness and strength.
[00:32:05] Whatever his rank holds his life less valuable than that of the humblest.
[00:32:14] He laughs at danger not because he does not dread it but because he has learnt that there
[00:32:20] are ailments more terrible and less curable than death.
[00:32:33] ailments more terrible and less curable than death and that ailment is cowardice.
[00:32:45] Until I became a part of the war I was a doubter of the nobility and others and a skeptic
[00:32:51] as regards to myself.
[00:32:54] The growth of my personal vision was complete when I recognized that the capacity of heroism
[00:33:00] is latent in everybody and only awaits the bigness of the opportunity to call it out.
[00:33:14] Different take.
[00:33:18] Obviously we talked about World War I and the less he's not the only person that felt
[00:33:26] this way about things and if this wasn't at least a fairly normal attitude to have there's
[00:33:33] no way that World War I could have continued on the way it did because people would have
[00:33:37] been saying no this is ridiculous.
[00:33:41] We just lost another 80,000 casualties.
[00:33:44] We lost another 100.
[00:33:46] These are battles where tens of thousands of people were casualties in one day and two days.
[00:33:54] So if people didn't have this kind of attitude that this was their duty they wouldn't have
[00:33:58] been able to maintain that type of that type of pace.
[00:34:04] And I don't even know whether to say I'm impressed by that or disgusted by it or disturbed.
[00:34:15] I didn't even have not disgusted but disturbed by it.
[00:34:19] Disurbed by it.
[00:34:21] And I would say all the time, you know this is the war that I would not want to fight
[00:34:25] it.
[00:34:26] Wouldn't want to fight it.
[00:34:29] Because this is the attitude is okay, your duty is to go get killed when we call.
[00:34:34] And it's just a matter how good.
[00:34:36] I say this all the time.
[00:34:37] It doesn't matter how good your tactics are, it doesn't matter how good of a leader you
[00:34:41] are because when we say go you're going to get your troops you're going to do what we say
[00:34:45] you're going to go over the top of your charge machine guns and guys you're going to
[00:34:48] get mode down.
[00:34:55] Now he goes into a little bit more about some of the battle.
[00:35:03] Back to the book, all this April, high above the shouting of the guns are larks.
[00:35:09] The larks, saying joyously, the scarlet of the poppies, the song of the larks, the lamp shining
[00:35:15] on the altar are the only external signs of the uncorcomable happy religion which lies
[00:35:22] in the hearts of our men.
[00:35:25] Their religion is the religion of heroism which they have learned in the glory
[00:35:33] of the trenches.
[00:35:36] There was a line from William Morris's earthly paradise which is like a long epic poem.
[00:35:42] It's almost like a novel which used to haunt me especially in the early days when I was
[00:35:48] first experiencing what war really meant.
[00:35:51] It reads his follows of heaven or hell I have no power to sing.
[00:35:58] I cannot ease the burden of your fears or make quick coming death a little thing.
[00:36:07] It's the last line that makes me smile rather quietly or make quick coming death a little
[00:36:13] thing.
[00:36:15] I smile because the souls who wear khaki have learned to do just that.
[00:36:29] These guys, this fear of death that people have and this poem that says, hey you can't
[00:36:34] make quick death.
[00:36:35] Quick coming death, you can't make that into a little thing.
[00:36:37] It's going to be huge anomalous.
[00:36:40] Guess what?
[00:36:41] These guys are okay with it.
[00:36:45] Back to the book, how typical he is of the days before the war when the people had only
[00:36:51] pinprix to endure.
[00:36:54] And consequently didn't exert themselves to be brave.
[00:36:58] A big sacrifice which bank rubs one's life is always more bearable than the little
[00:37:05] inevitable annoyances of sickness, disappointment and dying in a bed.
[00:37:11] The burden of our fears has slipped from our shoulders in our attempt to do something for
[00:37:18] others.
[00:37:20] The unbelievable and long-covided miracle has happened at last to every soul who has grasped
[00:37:28] his chance of heroism, quick coming death has become a fifth rate calamity.
[00:37:39] Think about that.
[00:37:40] Never get whatever.
[00:37:42] Whatever.
[00:37:43] You're no big deal to me.
[00:37:44] You're a fifth rate calamity.
[00:37:49] Back to the book.
[00:37:50] In saying this, I do not mean to glorify war.
[00:37:55] War can never be anything but beastly and damnable.
[00:37:59] It dates back to the jungle, but there are two kinds of war.
[00:38:06] There's the kind that highway men wages when he pounces from the bushes and assaults a
[00:38:11] defenseless woman.
[00:38:15] Then there's also the kind where you wage when you go to rescue her.
[00:38:21] The highway man can't expect to come out of that fight with a loft or your morality, but
[00:38:27] you can.
[00:38:29] Our chaps never want to defy.
[00:38:31] They hate fighting.
[00:38:34] It's that hatred of the thing they are compelled to do that makes them so terrible.
[00:38:42] He goes back and he's talking now about that wooden figure of Christ that he had seen.
[00:38:49] The wooden Christ gays down from them on his cross with a suffering which 2,000 years
[00:38:55] ago he had shared.
[00:38:59] The terrible pity of his silence seemed to be telling them that they had become one with him
[00:39:04] in their final sacrifice.
[00:39:07] They hadn't lived his life far from it, but unknowingly they had died his death.
[00:39:17] That's a part of the glory of the trenches that a man who has not been good can crucify
[00:39:23] himself and hang beside Christ in the end.
[00:39:29] So go out on the battlefield and you sacrifice your life, you will, all of your sins are
[00:39:36] gone, you're washed away and you hang beside Christ in the end.
[00:39:50] God as we see him and do we see him, I think so, but not always consciously.
[00:39:57] He moves among us in the forms of our brother men.
[00:40:02] We see him most evidently when danger is most threatening and courage is at its highest.
[00:40:09] We often don't recognize him out loud.
[00:40:11] Our chaps don't assert that there is fellow campaigners.
[00:40:15] They're too humble-minded and inarticulate for that.
[00:40:19] So he's saying, God's all around us, I see it in the guys, they're his campaigners,
[00:40:25] but they don't even, they don't say that.
[00:40:27] They don't say we're doing the work of God.
[00:40:29] They don't say we're living like God or we're living like Jesus Christ.
[00:40:32] No, they're too humble-minded and inarticulate for that.
[00:40:37] They're where they are because they want to do their bit, their duty.
[00:40:44] They're carefully disguised instinctive honor brought them there.
[00:40:50] Doing their bit in Bible language means laying down their lives for their friends.
[00:40:59] Doing their bit that covers everything.
[00:41:03] Here's an example of how God walks among us.
[00:41:06] In one of our attacks on the Psalm, all the observers up forward were uncertain as to what
[00:41:11] it happened.
[00:41:13] We didn't know whether our infantry had captured their objective, failed or gone beyond
[00:41:17] it.
[00:41:18] The battlefield, as far as the eye could reach, was a bath of mud.
[00:41:23] It is extremely easy and the excitement of an offensive when all landmarks are blotted
[00:41:28] out for our storming parties to lose their direction.
[00:41:31] If this happens, a number of dangers may result.
[00:41:34] Of Italian may find itself up in the air, which means that it failed to connect with the
[00:41:38] battalions on its left and right.
[00:41:41] This flanks are then exposed to the enemy.
[00:41:45] It may advance too far and start digging itself in at a point where it was previously
[00:41:49] arranged that our artillery should place their protective wall of fire.
[00:41:55] We, being forward artillery observers, are the eyes of the army.
[00:42:00] It is our business to watch for such contingencies to keep in touch with the situation
[00:42:05] as it progresses and to send our information back as quickly as possible.
[00:42:10] We were peering through our glasses from our point of vantage wind, far away in the thickest
[00:42:15] of the battle smoke we saw a white flag waving, sending back messages.
[00:42:21] The flag waving was repeatedly desperate.
[00:42:24] It was evident that no one had replied and probably that no one had picked up the messages.
[00:42:30] A signal who was with us, read the language for us.
[00:42:34] A company of infantry had advanced too far.
[00:42:36] They were most of them wounded.
[00:42:40] Very many of them dead and were in danger of being surrounded.
[00:42:43] They asked for artillery to place a curtain of fire in front of them and for reinforcements
[00:42:48] to be sent up.
[00:42:53] So they are in their trench.
[00:42:54] They are the artillery guys.
[00:42:55] They are looking out.
[00:42:56] They see flag which is one of the methodologies they had for signaling and communicating.
[00:43:00] You do these different signals.
[00:43:01] You can spell out words and so they are getting a signal back from this group that they might
[00:43:06] get surrounded.
[00:43:07] We are more artillery support in here.
[00:43:11] We at once famed the orders through to our artillery and notify the infantry headquarters
[00:43:16] of the division that was holding the front.
[00:43:19] But it was necessary to let those chaps know that we were aware of their predicament.
[00:43:24] They'd hang on if they knew that.
[00:43:26] Otherwise, without orders our signaler was getting his flags ready, he hopped on to the
[00:43:35] trench.
[00:43:37] He hopped out of the trench and onto the parapet.
[00:43:40] He didn't stand a 50-50 chance.
[00:43:43] The hunt was familiar with our observation station and strafed it with persistent regularity.
[00:43:50] The signaler turned to the senior officer present.
[00:43:53] What shall I send them?
[00:43:55] Tell them their messages have been received and that help is coming.
[00:44:00] Out the chaps scrambled, a flag in either hand.
[00:44:02] He was nothing but a boy.
[00:44:05] He ran, crouching like a rabbit to a hump of mud where his figure would show up against
[00:44:09] the sky.
[00:44:10] His flags commenced a waving, messages received help coming.
[00:44:14] They didn't see him at first.
[00:44:16] He had to repeat the words.
[00:44:17] We watched him breathlessly.
[00:44:20] We knew what would happen.
[00:44:23] At last, it did happen.
[00:44:26] A horn observer had spotted him and flashed the target back to his guns.
[00:44:30] All about him, the mud commenced to leap up and bubble.
[00:44:35] He went on signaling the good word to those stranded men up front.
[00:44:39] Message received, help coming.
[00:44:42] At least they'd seen him.
[00:44:44] They were signaling okay.
[00:44:46] It was at that moment that a whiz bang lifted him off his feet and landed him all of
[00:44:53] a huddle.
[00:44:55] His bit.
[00:44:57] He was what he'd volunteered to do when he came from Canada.
[00:45:04] The signal okay in the battle smoke was like a testimony to his character.
[00:45:16] So like I said, this had to be a common attitude and it's just hard for us to understand.
[00:45:21] It's hard for me that was in the military for 20 years to understand this attitude
[00:45:25] that you know what, it's your time to die now.
[00:45:28] Step up and pass their signaling back to them.
[00:45:31] I'm not saying that modern military guys don't take risks.
[00:45:35] Obviously take them enormous risks and we've got taken drastic casualties.
[00:45:41] But it is, this is definitely a different mentality.
[00:45:44] There's no doubt about it.
[00:45:45] Obviously it's a different mentality when you're losing millions of men.
[00:45:52] The millions of men.
[00:46:01] Back to the book and this is fast forward a little bit to kind of just giving a little
[00:46:05] more insight about what their outlook was.
[00:46:09] Out there in France, we used to tell each other fairy tales of how we would spend the first
[00:46:14] year of life when the war was ended.
[00:46:18] One man had a baby who had never seen.
[00:46:21] Another girl whom he was anxious to marry.
[00:46:24] My dream was more prosaic but no less ecstatic.
[00:46:28] It began and ended with a large white bed and a large white bath.
[00:46:34] For the first 365 mornings after peace had been declared, I was to be awakened by the sound
[00:46:40] of my bath being filled.
[00:46:44] Water was to be so plentiful that I could tumble off to sleep again without even troubling
[00:46:49] to turn off the tap.
[00:46:52] In France, one has to go dirty so often that the dream of always being cleaned seems
[00:46:57] as unrealizable as romance.
[00:47:01] Our drinking water is frequently brought up to us at the risk of men's lives.
[00:47:07] Carried through the mud and petrol can strap to pack horses.
[00:47:12] To use it carelessly would be like washing in men's blood.
[00:47:20] Here's another little paragraph again giving some more insight.
[00:47:25] You wouldn't think that the men would go to war to learn how to be kind but they do.
[00:47:31] There's no kind or creature in the whole wide world in the average Tommy.
[00:47:35] He makes a friend of any stray animal he can find.
[00:47:38] He shares his last friend with a chap who isn't his pal.
[00:47:42] He risks his life to die in consequently to rescue anyone who's elounded.
[00:47:48] He's gone over the top with the bomb and bayonet for the express purpose of doing in the
[00:47:53] hunt.
[00:47:55] But he makes a comrade of the fritzy he captures.
[00:47:58] You'll seem coming down the battered trenches with some scarred lad of a German at his
[00:48:03] side.
[00:48:14] Now he as I said in the beginning this we he gets wounded and at this point he's been wounded
[00:48:21] and now he's heading to Blighty which we talked about this before on the podcast.
[00:48:26] But Blighty was slaying for going back to England.
[00:48:32] Back to the book never in all my fortnight journey to Blighty did I hear a word of self pity
[00:48:39] or complaining.
[00:48:40] So he's going to the bunch of wounded people he's not hearing any complaining.
[00:48:43] On the contrary the most severely wounded men would profess themselves grateful that they had
[00:48:48] gotten off so lightly.
[00:48:50] Since the war started to turn lightly has become exceedingly comparative.
[00:48:55] I suppose a man is justified in saying he's got off lightly when what he expected was
[00:49:01] death.
[00:49:04] I remember a big highland officer who'd been shot in the kneecap.
[00:49:09] He'd been operated on and the kneecap had been found to be so splintered it had to be
[00:49:13] removed of this he was unaware.
[00:49:17] For the first day as he lay in bed he kept wondering aloud how long it would be before
[00:49:22] he could rejoin his battalion.
[00:49:26] Perhaps he suspected his condition and was trying to find out.
[00:49:30] All his heart seemed set at once on getting back into the fighting.
[00:49:36] Next morning he plucked up the courage to ask the doctor and received the answer he
[00:49:42] had dreaded.
[00:49:44] Never you won't be going back old chap.
[00:49:50] Next time he spoke his voice was a bit throaty will it stiffen?
[00:49:56] You've lost the knee joint the doctor said but with luck we'll save the leg.
[00:50:02] His voice sank to a whisper.
[00:50:05] If you do it won't be much good will it?
[00:50:09] Not much said the doctor.
[00:50:13] He lay for a couple hours silent, readjusting his mind to meet the new conditions.
[00:50:19] Then he commenced talking with cheerfulness about returning to his family.
[00:50:25] The habit of courage it conquered.
[00:50:27] The habit of courage which grows out of knowledge that you let your pals down by showing
[00:50:33] cowardice.
[00:50:34] So, took him a couple hours to adjust and said okay.
[00:50:41] Looks like I can get to go back to my family.
[00:50:49] Now we have another type of casualty here talking about men that have had major disfigurements
[00:50:58] to their faces and they would wrap their whole faces up.
[00:51:06] Back to the book.
[00:51:07] In these days that followed I saw several of these masked men.
[00:51:12] The worst cases were not allowed to walk about.
[00:51:16] The ones I saw were invariably dressed with the most scrupulous care in the smartest
[00:51:22] uniforms.
[00:51:24] Sam Browns, the best adult that goes over your shoulder, polished buttons, shining.
[00:51:30] They had hope and took a pride in themselves, a splendid sign.
[00:51:36] Perhaps you ask why the faces kept the face cases should be kept in front so the guys
[00:51:41] that had major facial disfigurements they would stay in France.
[00:51:50] I was not told but I can guess because they dread going back to England to their girls
[00:51:54] until they got rid of their disfigurements.
[00:51:57] So for two years through their bandages they watched the train pull out for Blady.
[00:52:03] All the damage which was done to them in a fragment of the second is repaired.
[00:52:19] At a base hospital you see something you don't see at casualty stations.
[00:52:23] Sisters, mothers, sweethearts and wives sitting beside the beds.
[00:52:30] They're allowed to come over from England when their man is dying.
[00:52:34] One of the wonderful things to me was to observe how these women in the hour of their
[00:52:38] tragedy catch this soldier's spirit.
[00:52:42] They're very quiet, very cheerful, very helpful.
[00:52:47] While passing through the ward they get to know some of the other patients and remember
[00:52:51] them.
[00:52:53] When they bring their own man flowers, sometimes when their own man is asleep they slip
[00:52:57] over to other bedcites and do something kind for the solitary fellows.
[00:53:02] That's the army all over.
[00:53:04] Military discipline is based on unselfishness.
[00:53:09] These women who have been sent to see their men die catch from them the spirit of undistressed
[00:53:15] sacrifice and enroll themselves as soldiers.
[00:53:23] You discover the spirit of the man when you've heard him wandering in delirium.
[00:53:29] So you talk in a little bit about the obviously guys that are suffering from shell shock
[00:53:36] is what they call it, what they used to call it in World War I.
[00:53:40] Guys that are having some mental issues all night in the shadowy ward with its hooded
[00:53:46] lamps.
[00:53:47] He would be giving orders for the comfort of his men.
[00:53:49] Sometimes he'd be proposing to go forward himself to a place where a company was having
[00:53:53] a hot time.
[00:53:55] Apparently one of his officers was trying to dissuade him.
[00:53:58] Danger be damned, he'd exclaim in a wonderfully strong voice.
[00:54:01] It'll buck him up to see me, splendid japs, splendid japs.
[00:54:12] For the soldier it seems that the war has always been and that they will never cease
[00:54:17] to being soldiers.
[00:54:18] For them both the past and the future are utterly obliterated.
[00:54:26] They would not have it otherwise, because they are doing their duty they are contented.
[00:54:34] The only time the subject is ever touched on is when someone expresses the hope that
[00:54:39] it'll last long enough for them to recover from his wounds and get back to the line.
[00:54:45] That usually starts another man who will never be any good, never be any more good for the
[00:54:51] trenches wondering whether he can get into the flying corps.
[00:54:56] The one ultimate hope of all these shattered wrecks who are being hurried to blighty.
[00:55:02] They have dreamt of is that they may see service again.
[00:55:09] We still hear that.
[00:55:12] We still hear that.
[00:55:17] I heard that.
[00:55:18] I talked about hearing that from Ryan Job who was blind and he's back at America and he's
[00:55:22] like let me come back.
[00:55:25] My first guy that I ever had would get wounded bad.
[00:55:30] I went to see him in the medical outstation.
[00:55:36] I just went down to like shake his hand and he was on morphing.
[00:55:39] He had been shot the leg. He didn't know if he was going to lose the leg or not.
[00:55:43] I went down and gave him, I went to shake his hand and he pulled me in and he's like
[00:55:49] let me stay.
[00:55:52] I was just like you man.
[00:55:55] What an awesome brother right there.
[00:55:56] This is not rare.
[00:55:57] This still happens.
[00:55:58] You hear this all the time.
[00:56:00] There's guys in the US military that go back to combat with one leg with one hand.
[00:56:09] I mean, even Jodi was like talking about, you know, when he woke up and showed him
[00:56:13] a medical who he was in the park.
[00:56:15] When he woke up and he found out that they took both of his legs.
[00:56:20] He was pissed because one leg you can still go back on the planet but two leg can't do
[00:56:24] it.
[00:56:25] So Jodi the badass was just like, no look.
[00:56:31] How am I going to go back now?
[00:56:37] Some of us will be back in the fighting and Jolly Glad of it.
[00:56:42] Others are doomed to remain in the trenches for the rest of their lives, not the trenches
[00:56:46] of the front line where they've been strafed by the hunt, but the trenches of physical
[00:56:52] curtailment where self-pity will launch wave after wave of attack against them.
[00:56:59] It won't be easy not to get the wind up.
[00:57:05] It'll be difficult to maintain normal cheerfulness but they're not the men they were before
[00:57:11] they went to war.
[00:57:13] Out there they've learned something.
[00:57:16] Their game, they'll remain soldiers whatever happens.
[00:57:20] So he's talking about these guys that are aren't going to be able to make it back and
[00:57:27] he's saying they're going to be hard for him.
[00:57:31] But he's saying that they're game but they're going to bring it.
[00:57:34] Is there going to remain soldiers regardless of what happens?
[00:57:40] Now this is a pretty interesting piece where he goes back to New York where like I said
[00:57:47] he had spent some time there and he's talking a little about what it's like in New York.
[00:57:53] He says there's one person I've missed since my return to New York.
[00:57:59] I've caught glimpses of him disappearing around corners but he dodges.
[00:58:04] I think he's a bit ashamed to meet me.
[00:58:08] That person is my old civilian self.
[00:58:14] What a full blown egoist he used to be.
[00:58:17] How full of gold and plans for his own advancement.
[00:58:21] How terrified of failure, of disease, of money losses, of death, of all the temporary external,
[00:58:32] non-essential things that have nothing to do with the spirit.
[00:58:40] War in itself is damnable.
[00:58:46] It's a extravagant, wasteful use of resources, a misuse of accumulated brain stuff of centuries.
[00:58:58] Nevertheless, there's many a man who has no love of war, who previous the war had cramped
[00:59:04] his soul with littleness and was chased by the bayonet of duty into the bloodstained
[00:59:10] largeness of the trenches who is alert to say thank God for this war.
[00:59:22] He thinks God not because of the carnage.
[00:59:27] But because when the wine-pressive new ideals was being trotting, he was born in an age
[00:59:34] where he could do his share.
[00:59:41] Often at the front, I have thought of Christ's explanation of his own unassailable peace.
[00:59:47] An explanation given to his disciples at the last supper, be of good cheer I have overcome
[00:59:52] the world.
[00:59:55] Overcoming the world, as I understand it, is overcoming fear.
[01:00:02] And it's final analysis is nothing but selfishness.
[01:00:07] A man who is afraid in the attack isn't thinking of his pals, of his pals, and how quickly
[01:00:14] terror spreads.
[01:00:15] He isn't thinking of the glory which we will accrue to his regiment or division if the
[01:00:19] attack is a success.
[01:00:21] He isn't thinking of what he can do to contribute to that success.
[01:00:26] He isn't thinking of the splendor of forcing his spirit to triumph over weiriness and
[01:00:33] nerves and the abominations that the hunts are chucking at him.
[01:00:40] He's merely thinking of how he can save his worthless skin and conduct his entirely
[01:00:47] unimportant body to a place where there aren't any shells.
[01:01:00] In London, as I saw the work of day, unconscious nobility of the maimed and wounded, the
[01:01:07] words I have overcome the world took an added depth.
[01:01:12] All these men have a eye of overcome the world looking their faces.
[01:01:18] It is comparatively easy for a soldier with traditions and ideals to get back to face
[01:01:26] death calmly, to become in the face of life as these chaps are takes graver courage.
[01:01:37] What has happened to them?
[01:01:40] Is attitude of mind or greatness of soul?
[01:01:43] Whatever you like to call it was learned in the trenches, where everything outward is polluted
[01:01:49] and damnable.
[01:01:52] Their experience at the front has given them what in the army language is known as guts,
[01:02:00] courage is an attitude of mind towards calamity and attitude of mind which makes the
[01:02:06] honorable accomplishing of duty more permanently satisfying than the preservation of self.
[01:02:16] Like I said, when I kicked this off, this is a different powerful angle to look at these
[01:02:22] things.
[01:02:23] I have talked about this as well.
[01:02:24] I don't know if you Sam Harris asked me.
[01:02:28] I was saying that hey, war shows you a lot of beauty in the juice where you get to see
[01:02:32] these incredible capacity of humanity.
[01:02:38] He said, you know, you say that, but I've also heard you describe war as horrible and
[01:02:43] I kind of gave him an answer about, you know, I asked him, I said, hey, if they've
[01:02:48] never known you, but survived cancer.
[01:02:50] He said, yes, and I'm like, yeah, and when they survive it, a lot of them say it opened
[01:02:56] my mind, it freed me from being afraid and it did all these wonderful things.
[01:03:01] I'm like, I would never wish it on anybody, but they don't, they don't wish that it
[01:03:06] didn't happen either.
[01:03:07] They learned so much from it.
[01:03:08] And that's how I feel about war and that's kind of what I read in a lot of this is Dawson
[01:03:15] saying, look, you are so changed by this and regardless of the horrors, the change is positive.
[01:03:23] It opens your eyes in a way that nothing else can.
[01:03:31] Back to the book, that's the kind of peep that God we got on the Western front.
[01:03:38] It is in the sad peep either, when men die for something worthwhile, death loses all its
[01:03:43] terror.
[01:03:46] It's peetering out in bed, from sickness or old age that's so horrifying.
[01:03:52] Many a man whose cowardice is at longer heads with a sense of duty comes to the front
[01:03:57] as a non-combatant.
[01:03:59] He compromises with his conscious and takes a bombproof job in some service whose places
[01:04:05] well behind the lines.
[01:04:07] So he's saying, okay, a lot of guys, they're like, hey, you know what, I'm kind of scared.
[01:04:10] I just want to, you know, just give me a easy job.
[01:04:13] Just, you know, I don't want to get killed.
[01:04:16] Back to the book, he doesn't stop there long.
[01:04:20] He's a decent, sir, sort.
[01:04:23] Having learned more than he ever guests before about the brutal things that Shellfire
[01:04:27] can do to you, he transfers into a fighting unit.
[01:04:32] Why?
[01:04:34] Because danger doesn't appall, it allures.
[01:04:39] It holds a challenge.
[01:04:40] It stings one's pride.
[01:04:42] It urges one to seek out ascending scales of risk.
[01:04:47] It's to prove to himself he isn't flabby.
[01:04:54] And flabby's actually another word that I looked up.
[01:04:55] There's an old, kind of capture what the real meaning is.
[01:05:00] And then there's the definition.
[01:05:02] Another definition is lacking strength or determination.
[01:05:07] Now this is classic.
[01:05:10] The safe job is the only job for which there's no competition in fighting units.
[01:05:17] You have to persuade men to be grooms or cooks or bat men.
[01:05:24] If you're seeking volunteers for a chance at annihilation, you'll have to cast lots to
[01:05:29] avoid the offense of rejecting.
[01:05:34] All of this is inexplicable to civilians.
[01:05:39] And again, this is something I saw with my own two eyes.
[01:05:42] And I talked about this in my retirement speech in Ramadi.
[01:05:44] And I was like, okay, we need volunteers who wants to go over and live in this hellhold
[01:05:48] and Eastern Ramadi and go out on operations where we're going to be taking casualties.
[01:05:52] It's going to be a nightmare and I can promise you nothing but blood, sweat, and tears.
[01:05:56] Who, if you want to go on that, if you want to go there, not not for one operation, but
[01:06:00] I'm going to put you there for six months.
[01:06:02] So who, you know, if you want that, put your name on the board.
[01:06:05] Every single guy does it.
[01:06:07] Every single guy does it.
[01:06:09] And that's exactly what he's talking about here.
[01:06:13] That's exactly how's it?
[01:06:14] As a matter of fact, I hooked up with a trooper down in New Zealand.
[01:06:17] Did you just do play or?
[01:06:18] And we were talking to you.
[01:06:20] He was using the in the commandos, in the Ramrian commandos, 40 commandos.
[01:06:27] And he was going to get moved to being a cook for his go four year duty as a cook.
[01:06:34] His work is going to get tasked with and he got out of the room.
[01:06:37] He got out of the room, rinse because you know what?
[01:06:39] He said, I'm not going to be a cook.
[01:06:40] You know, I'm a warrior.
[01:06:43] I want to go and get after it.
[01:06:45] So that's like, you see that, in this modern day, you know, I'm talking about how different
[01:06:49] it was back then, but maybe it was as different as I think it is.
[01:06:52] Yeah.
[01:06:53] Because we still got troopers that are just willing to step up all the time.
[01:06:57] And that's that's one thing that's awesome.
[01:06:58] You know, again, from my experience in the in the in the in the seal teams, you know,
[01:07:03] when I went in there was no war going on, I kind of thought that there was, but
[01:07:06] there wasn't.
[01:07:07] But these guys, these kids that come in now, they know where they're going.
[01:07:10] They know there's a war going on.
[01:07:12] They know they're going to get after it.
[01:07:14] And they're lining up.
[01:07:16] I know man, it's crazy how many people I see their reason to join is to go fight these bad
[01:07:23] guys.
[01:07:24] It's not because I don't have anything better to do or not.
[01:07:27] It's like, nah, I want to I want to quit my job and go fight.
[01:07:31] Yeah, there's no doubt about it.
[01:07:33] No doubt about it.
[01:07:38] Now I like this because we start hammering on some philosophers a little bit.
[01:07:42] No offense to a Darryl Cooper and Margar made because he's a big philosophy guy.
[01:07:47] I know where you're at Cooper.
[01:07:52] I'm going to agree with Dawson on this one.
[01:07:53] Here we go.
[01:07:54] Back to the book.
[01:07:55] If civilian philosophers fail to explain us, we can explain them.
[01:08:01] In their world, they are the center of their universe.
[01:08:06] They look inward instead of outward.
[01:08:09] The sun rises and sets to minister to their particular happiness.
[01:08:14] If they die, the stars would vanish.
[01:08:20] We understand a few months ago, we too were like that.
[01:08:27] What makes us reckless of death is our intense gratitude that we have altered.
[01:08:33] We want to prove ourselves and access how utterly changed we are from what we were.
[01:08:43] In his secret heart, the egoist is a self-despisor.
[01:08:51] Can you imagine what a difference it works in a man after years of self-contempt at least
[01:08:57] for one brief moment to approve of himself?
[01:09:02] Since we can remember, we are chained to the prison house of our bodies.
[01:09:06] We live to feed our bodies to close our bodies to preserve our bodies to minister to their passions.
[01:09:16] Now we know that our bodies are mere flimsy shells in which our souls are paramount.
[01:09:25] We can fling them aside in a minute.
[01:09:27] They become ignoble.
[01:09:29] The moment the soul has departed, we have proof.
[01:09:34] Often, at zero hour, we have seen whole populations of cities go over the top in vanish.
[01:09:43] Weaving behind their bloody rags.
[01:09:49] We should go mad if we did not believe in immortality.
[01:09:53] We know that the physical is not the essential part.
[01:09:56] How better can a man shake off his flesh than at the hour when his spirit is most shining?
[01:10:06] The exact day when he dies does not matter tomorrow or 50 years hence, the vital concern
[01:10:13] is not when.
[01:10:16] But how?
[01:10:21] The civilian philosopher considers what we've lost.
[01:10:27] He forgets that it could never have been ours for long.
[01:10:39] Giving up the self.
[01:10:40] There's some Zen and I'm no Buddhist monk, but there's a lot of Zen philosophy in there,
[01:10:46] too.
[01:10:47] You're completely surrendering yourself.
[01:10:50] And that's a powerful, powerful thing.
[01:10:52] You look like you really liked that last part there.
[01:10:55] It's heavy stuff.
[01:11:00] Here he goes down the same vein, comparing civilian life.
[01:11:06] And so he was talking about civilian philosophers.
[01:11:09] Now he's going to go into just talking about the civilian, even how civilian spend their
[01:11:14] life and how he used to spend his life.
[01:11:18] Here we go back to the book.
[01:11:20] We probably caught a train in every morning.
[01:11:23] The same train we went to a business where we sat at a desk.
[01:11:27] Neither the business nor the desk ever altered.
[01:11:31] We received the same strafing from the same employer or if we were the employer we administered
[01:11:37] the same strafing.
[01:11:40] We only did these things that we might eat bread.
[01:11:45] Our dreams were all selfish of more clothes, more respect, more food, bigger houses.
[01:11:56] The least part of the day we've devoted to the people and the things we really cared for.
[01:12:06] And the people we loved, we weren't always even nice to them.
[01:12:16] And then he breaks and he goes into what it is being a soldier.
[01:12:21] He says, being a soldier is doing a man's job, doing it for someone else and unafraid to
[01:12:29] meet God.
[01:12:35] And now he's about to go and discuss where this comes from.
[01:12:42] Nevertheless, it is true.
[01:12:43] It isn't natural to be brave.
[01:12:46] How then have multitudes of man acquired this sudden act of courage?
[01:12:54] They have acquired it through discipline and training.
[01:13:00] When you have subjected yourself to discipline, you cease to think of yourself.
[01:13:07] You are not you, but part of a company of men.
[01:13:12] If you don't do your duty, you throw the whole machine out.
[01:13:17] You soon learn the hard lesson that every man's life and every man's service belongs to other
[01:13:22] people.
[01:13:24] If this, the organization of an army is a vivid illustration, take the infantry for instance.
[01:13:31] They can't fight by themselves.
[01:13:33] They're dependent on the support of the artillery.
[01:13:35] The artillery in turn would be terribly crippled or not for the gallantry of the air service.
[01:13:41] If the infantry collapse, the guns have to go back.
[01:13:45] If the infantry advance, the guns have to be pulled forward.
[01:13:48] This close interdependence of service on service division on division, battalion on
[01:13:52] battalion follows right down through the army till it reaches the individual.
[01:13:59] So that each man feels that the day will be lost if he fails.
[01:14:07] His imagination becomes intrigued by the immensity of the stakes for which he plays.
[01:14:15] Any physical calamity which may happen to himself becomes trifling when compared with
[01:14:22] the disgrace he would bring upon his regiment if he were not courageous.
[01:14:33] Now I'm about to read a piece that's, it's just a story he tells a story within a story.
[01:14:44] And we'll go right to it.
[01:14:45] A few months ago I was handling over a battery position in a fairly warm place.
[01:14:51] The major who came up to take over for me brought with him a subaltern and just enough
[01:14:57] men to run the guns.
[01:14:59] Within a half an hour of their arrival, a stray shell came in and caught the subaltern
[01:15:04] in five of the gun detachment.
[01:15:08] As plain at once that the subaltern was dying, his name must have been written on the
[01:15:13] shell as we say in France.
[01:15:16] We got a stretcher and made all haste to rush him out to a dressing station.
[01:15:24] Just as he was leaving, he asked to speak with his major.
[01:15:27] I'm sorry sir.
[01:15:28] I didn't mean to get wounded.
[01:15:30] He whispered.
[01:15:32] The last word he sent back from the dressing station where he died was tell the major I didn't
[01:15:37] mean to do it.
[01:15:41] That's the discipline.
[01:15:42] He didn't think of himself.
[01:15:44] All he thought of was that his major would be left short handed.
[01:15:53] He's about to tell another story that is, well I'm just going to read it.
[01:16:05] Last spring the night before an attack, a man was brought into battalion headquarters dug
[01:16:09] out under arrest.
[01:16:14] The colonel and the agitant were busy attending the last details of their preparations.
[01:16:21] The agitant looked up irritably.
[01:16:23] What is it?
[01:16:25] The NCO of the guard answered, we found this man's sir in a communication trench.
[01:16:32] His company has been in the front line for two hours.
[01:16:35] He was sitting down with his equipment thrown away and evidently has no intention of
[01:16:40] going up.
[01:16:44] The agitant glanced coldly at the prisoner.
[01:16:49] One of you to say for yourself.
[01:16:50] So you understand this?
[01:16:52] So they found this soldier.
[01:16:54] He was his troops were up and fighting on the front line for two hours.
[01:16:58] They find him.
[01:17:00] He's got his radio strewn about and they say, are you going to go fight with your men?
[01:17:04] And he says he's not going to go.
[01:17:06] So the agitant glanced coldly at the prisoner.
[01:17:09] What of you to say for yourself?
[01:17:12] The man was ghastly white and shaking like an aspirin.
[01:17:18] Sir, I'm not the man I was since I saw my best friend Jimmy.
[01:17:21] We had his head blown off and lying in his hands.
[01:17:25] It's kind of got me.
[01:17:27] I can't face up to it.
[01:17:32] The agitant was silent for a few seconds.
[01:17:36] Then he said, you have a double choice.
[01:17:41] I can either be shot up there doing your duty or behind the lines as a coward.
[01:17:48] It's for you to choose.
[01:17:50] I don't care.
[01:17:55] The interview is ended.
[01:17:57] He turned again to the Colonel.
[01:17:59] The man slowly straightened himself, saluted like a soldier and marched out alone to the front.
[01:18:09] That's what discipline does for a man who's going back on himself.
[01:18:22] Like I said, I'm not even sure how I feel about that story.
[01:18:27] I actually don't know.
[01:18:30] You got a guy in the hack where he talks about this dick.
[01:18:32] Winners talked about this.
[01:18:33] Where you get guys that they're broken.
[01:18:37] You've got to give him a break.
[01:18:41] What had this guy been through God only knows.
[01:18:45] Obviously, he saw his friend get killed.
[01:18:46] I'm sure he was near death over and over again.
[01:18:51] The Colonel just says, you either get out there and die.
[01:18:56] You die back here as a coward.
[01:19:00] There's like a part of me that is filled with admiration.
[01:19:15] The guy obviously overcomes his fears and there's also a part of me that's filled with horror
[01:19:22] because he overcomes his fears.
[01:19:27] To give that final order and for the soldier to give that final salute, it's just all
[01:19:40] of it, the bravery and at the same time, the cowlessness and at the same time, the fear
[01:19:47] and the dedication to duty and yet it's dedication to madness.
[01:20:02] And again, it's a window into human nature.
[01:20:10] And what people go through and what people will do and won't do and what it takes to get
[01:20:17] him there.
[01:20:26] Back to the book.
[01:20:28] One of the big influences that helps keep a soldier's soul sanitary is what's known in the
[01:20:35] British Army as spit and polish.
[01:20:40] Basically we pull out for a rest we start to working, burnishing and washing.
[01:20:45] The chaps may have shown the most brilliant courage and self-sacrificing endurance it
[01:20:50] counts for nothing if they're untidy.
[01:20:53] The first morning no matter what are the weather conditions we hold an inspection.
[01:20:59] Every man has to show up with his chin-shaped hair cut, leather polished and button shining.
[01:21:06] If he doesn't, he gets hell.
[01:21:12] So I mean clearly we've talked about this since day one, the discipline and maintaining
[01:21:17] the discipline.
[01:21:18] And here these guys coming off the front lines from the trenches.
[01:21:21] All right cool tomorrow morning we're having inspections of get your deer together
[01:21:25] and polish your boots.
[01:21:28] Back to the book, there's a lot in it.
[01:21:30] You bring a man out from a tight corner where he's been an hourly contact with death.
[01:21:35] He's apt to think what's the use in taking pride of myself.
[01:21:38] I'm likely to be done in any day.
[01:21:42] It'll all be the same if I'm dead.
[01:21:45] But if he doesn't keep clean in his body he won't keep clean in his mind.
[01:21:51] The man who has his button shining brightly in his leather polished is usually the man who
[01:21:57] is brightly polished on the inside.
[01:22:01] And polish teaches a man to come out of the trenches from seeing his palettes killed and
[01:22:05] carry on as though nothing abnormal had happened.
[01:22:10] It educates him in an impersonal attitude towards calamity which makes it bearable.
[01:22:18] It forces him not to regard anything too tragically.
[01:22:23] If you can stand aside from yourself and poke fun at your own tragedy, and tragedy always
[01:22:29] has its humors aspects.
[01:22:32] That helps.
[01:22:37] We were sometimes we were in the som for several months.
[01:22:40] The mud was up to our knees almost all the time.
[01:22:43] We were perishingly cold and very rarely dry.
[01:22:46] There was no natural cover.
[01:22:47] When we went up forward to observe we would stand in water to our knees for 24 hours
[01:22:51] rather than going to the dugouts.
[01:22:54] They were so filled with vermin and batten flies.
[01:22:58] Even if we were wounded and strayed man often drowned on their buck journey back from
[01:23:02] the front line, many of the dead never got buried lives couldn't be rescued in carrying
[01:23:06] them out.
[01:23:08] We were so weary that the sight of those who rested forever only stirred in us a quiet
[01:23:14] envy.
[01:23:17] Our emotions were too exhausted for hatred.
[01:23:20] They usually are unless some new hunishness had roused them.
[01:23:26] When we were having a bad time, we'd glance across no man's land and say poor old fritzy,
[01:23:31] he's getting the worst of it.
[01:23:34] That thought helps.
[01:23:39] This is a piece where he talks about when somebody's not holding the line, when somebody's
[01:23:44] a quitter.
[01:23:47] When you come to consider it, a quitter is always a selfish man.
[01:23:52] A selfishness that makes a man a coward or a deserter, if he's in a dangerous place and runs
[01:23:57] away, all he's doing is thinking of himself.
[01:24:06] He goes on to say, here, I've been supposed to have been talking about God as we see him.
[01:24:12] I don't know whether I have.
[01:24:14] As a matter of fact, if you ask me when I was out there, whether there was any religion
[01:24:18] in the trenches, I should have replied certainly not.
[01:24:24] Now that I've been out of the fighting for a while, I see that there is religion there,
[01:24:29] a religion which will dominate the world when the war has ended, the religion of heroism.
[01:24:34] It's a religion in which men don't pray much.
[01:24:39] With me before I went to the front, prayer was a habit.
[01:24:44] Out there, I lost the habit.
[01:24:47] Not one was doing seemed sufficient.
[01:24:52] I got the feeling that I might be meeting God at any moment, so I didn't need to be worrying
[01:24:57] him all the time, hanging on to spiritual telephone and feeling slidied if he didn't answer
[01:25:04] me directly when I rang him up.
[01:25:08] If God was really interested in me, he didn't need constant reminding.
[01:25:12] When he had a world to manage, it seemed best not to interrupt him with fearless petitions,
[01:25:20] but to put my prayers into my work.
[01:25:25] That's how we all feel out there.
[01:25:29] I've learnt discipline and my own total unimportant.
[01:25:35] In the army discipline gets possession of your soul, you learn to suppress yourself
[01:25:41] to obey implicitly to think of others before yourself.
[01:25:45] You learn to jump at an order to forsake your own convenience at any hour of the day or
[01:25:51] night to go forward on the most lonely and dangerous errands without complaining.
[01:25:57] You learn to feel that there is only one thing that counts in life and only one thing
[01:26:03] you can make out of it.
[01:26:05] The spirit you have developed in encountering difficulties.
[01:26:12] Your body is nothing.
[01:26:14] It can be smashed in a minute how frail it is you never realize until you've seen men
[01:26:19] smashed, so you learn to tolerate the body, to despise death and to place all your alliance
[01:26:27] on courage.
[01:26:29] Which when is found at its best is the power to endure for the sake of others.
[01:26:47] It is closing out here.
[01:26:54] The religion of the trenches is not a religion which analyzes God with in-pertoned speculation.
[01:27:02] So in this religion the trenches God is not standing in some kind of a foritary judgment.
[01:27:09] It isn't a religion which takes up much of his time.
[01:27:14] It's a religion which teaches men to carry on stoutly and to say, I've tried to do my bit
[01:27:21] as best I know how.
[01:27:27] That's the simple religion of the trenches as I have learned it.
[01:27:31] A religion not without glory.
[01:27:35] To carry on as bravely as you know how and to trust God without worrying him.
[01:27:46] And the last line I'll read from the glory of the trenches, Dawson says, it's funny.
[01:27:54] You go away to the most damnable undertaking ever invented.
[01:28:03] And you come back cleaner in spirit.
[01:28:16] And again I will tell you that from my perspective and from what I've been through
[01:28:24] which by the way, I want to say that what I've been through in my military career is absolutely
[01:28:31] nothing.
[01:28:33] Nothing compared to what a soldier in the world were one lived through.
[01:28:39] But what I did go through, I will say this.
[01:28:41] I don't think war took anything away from me or impacted me in a negative way.
[01:28:53] I think war made me better.
[01:28:59] I think war made me a better man, a better person.
[01:29:06] And in the words of Dawson,
[01:29:10] I think it absolutely cleaned my spirit.
[01:29:19] And I am thankful for that.
[01:29:26] And I guess that the question becomes how can we clean our spirits without war?
[01:29:34] How can we do that?
[01:29:35] And I think the answer again, and this is something that I don't think is that it comes
[01:29:43] from discipline.
[01:29:44] And that's what I talk about all the time.
[01:29:46] It's about setting aside comfort, setting aside weakness, setting aside fear, and having
[01:29:51] the discipline to endure.
[01:29:56] And the challenges in the hardship and the pain in order to become better.
[01:30:10] To suffer the glory of the discipline, to become stronger and faster and smarter and better.
[01:30:28] And now from a leadership perspective is to then put others before yourself.
[01:30:40] The try and do some good in the world for others to lead them down the right path, not
[01:30:48] for you.
[01:30:52] But for them.
[01:30:57] And while war certainly taught me those things and ingrained those things into my mind
[01:31:05] if they weren't already there, I don't think you need to go to war.
[01:31:10] But I do think that you have to discipline yourself.
[01:31:20] You have to get outside your comfort zone and you have to push yourself beyond what you
[01:31:24] thought you could ever do.
[01:31:27] To get that glimpse of the truth and to get that glimpse of the glory in the trenches.
[01:31:57] And again, thanks to Jesse for sending me this book, Outstanding Old Copy Printed in 1918.
[01:32:11] I actually typed it all out so I didn't have to mess up this beautiful book.
[01:32:18] I learned a lot from it.
[01:32:20] So I appreciate it.
[01:32:23] And echo Charles.
[01:32:28] Save me and talk.
[01:32:33] Talk about something more like for instance.
[01:32:37] But like for instance, people just listen to this and maybe they want to listen to more
[01:32:42] of it.
[01:32:43] How could they help that occur in the world?
[01:32:46] Move that process along.
[01:32:48] We could just talk about Jockel White T for like 10 minutes.
[01:32:53] We could definitely talk about Jockel White T.
[01:32:54] I wasn't really that into, actually I was.
[01:32:57] I'm into T every once in a while.
[01:32:59] I can hear you say a lot of the T from the offices now missing.
[01:33:03] But you know how like you're like, you know, it's a mellow night.
[01:33:07] I should just call it and go to bed or something.
[01:33:10] Then I'd make like, you know what's the mellow one?
[01:33:13] Can't remember.
[01:33:14] Whatever.
[01:33:15] Yeah, I'm not into T like I said.
[01:33:18] So I was like, all right, well hey, you know, Jockel T.
[01:33:21] It's cool.
[01:33:23] I'm cool.
[01:33:24] Yeah.
[01:33:25] How's that working out?
[01:33:26] It's not going to say.
[01:33:27] No, it's like a random Saturday.
[01:33:29] And I was like, I'm going to do like how you do put it on ice and see if I can't get my
[01:33:34] refresh on, you know, outside it, whatever.
[01:33:37] And so I put it in.
[01:33:39] I put in this tin collo.
[01:33:40] Nice man.
[01:33:41] I was like, oh, I think I might be into T a little bit.
[01:33:44] Sarah comes out.
[01:33:45] She has hers too.
[01:33:46] It was nice.
[01:33:47] It was cool man.
[01:33:48] We are going through it very quickly because they're, well, I hope I am
[01:33:51] always getting after it right now.
[01:33:52] This is my younger kids.
[01:33:55] But yeah, and you know what's awesome?
[01:33:57] I don't know if you've gone to Amazon.com and read the reviews that people are writing.
[01:34:04] I'm actually going to have to bring out some of those and read them because they're awesome.
[01:34:09] They're funny as hell and they're great.
[01:34:12] So everyone that's writing reviews for Jockel T, Jockel White T, I appreciate it.
[01:34:18] It's awesome.
[01:34:19] Got a lot of good feedback as well about, you know, everyone likes it tastes great.
[01:34:25] And it makes you feel real good.
[01:34:27] It makes you feel, it's a little glory, a little glory in a cup, little glory in a
[01:34:32] iced tea.
[01:34:33] So I was looking over like the instructions.
[01:34:36] So let me just in case you don't read the instructions, I think they're pretty straightforward.
[01:34:41] I think you've ever had tea.
[01:34:43] Yeah.
[01:34:44] People know.
[01:34:45] But if you took the time to read the instructions, this is what you would read.
[01:34:48] So you can read the instructions.
[01:34:49] Boyle eight out of the water, pour water over one bag of Jockel White T, proof for three
[01:34:54] to five minutes.
[01:34:55] Enjoy over or enjoy hot or over ice.
[01:35:00] Get after it.
[01:35:01] So get after it is part of the instructions.
[01:35:05] In what's funny is people are, it's real.
[01:35:08] Like you really, you really have to get after it when you're done.
[01:35:13] And so that's what the funny is people are saying.
[01:35:17] It's real.
[01:35:18] It's real.
[01:35:19] There's real stuff in there.
[01:35:21] And when you get it in your brain, you'll be like, oh, I'm going to go knock out some
[01:35:24] projects.
[01:35:25] Maybe do a little MacCon.
[01:35:26] Maybe go on the Mac.
[01:35:27] Whatever.
[01:35:28] You know, it's just good.
[01:35:29] Or am I just cruise by the pool?
[01:35:32] No, we don't do that.
[01:35:34] That's not getting out of it.
[01:35:35] That makes one of us.
[01:35:37] I was getting after it in the pool.
[01:35:39] How about that?
[01:35:40] I guess I year approved.
[01:35:41] Yeah, not it's good man.
[01:35:42] Like I said, it may be even more into tea because it's like, you know, it's like
[01:35:48] you get into, well, I did.
[01:35:50] I'm not going to say, this is what happens.
[01:35:52] But I'm saying, you're like, okay, I like this tea.
[01:35:54] I like the brand, you know?
[01:35:56] So you're, and then you appreciate the experience when it goes down.
[01:35:59] You know, you're more familiar with it now.
[01:36:01] Now I want to see people drinking tea.
[01:36:02] I'm like, yeah, yeah.
[01:36:03] And some people been like, whoa, some people emailed and said, whoa, is it really
[01:36:07] like, jocquo, you made this tea?
[01:36:09] I'm really.
[01:36:10] Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:11] I went through, it took like, it took a few months to make.
[01:36:13] Cause I kind of, I'd send back, oh, no, make it a little bit more this.
[01:36:16] A little bit less of that.
[01:36:17] And eventually, when I got the, the right combination thing, then it was okay.
[01:36:23] And, well, they're like, okay, well, for marketing, what do you want to do?
[01:36:25] And I go, oh, it's, oh, here's the marketing.
[01:36:27] I'm, I'm Mr. Marketing over here.
[01:36:29] Put it in a black box.
[01:36:31] Oh, what should we call it?
[01:36:32] Oh, I think of a good original title.
[01:36:34] Jocquo tea.
[01:36:35] How's that?
[01:36:36] Okay, so we got Jocquo tea.
[01:36:37] Good.
[01:36:38] There it is.
[01:36:39] And that's my marketing strategy.
[01:36:41] Hey, hey.
[01:36:44] Yeah, man.
[01:36:45] No, I like it.
[01:36:46] I actually did a very high-ranking company to come in and do an assessment of our customers.
[01:36:50] Guess what?
[01:36:51] Our customers are out to kick ass.
[01:36:53] They don't want all this crap.
[01:36:55] They want something that's going to make them crush the world.
[01:36:59] Yeah.
[01:37:00] So, there you go.
[01:37:01] We don't need to put any, you know, images of whatever on it.
[01:37:05] Yeah, doing some kind of demographic studies on what can interest and, you know, who's
[01:37:10] the target market, the target market?
[01:37:11] I don't care.
[01:37:12] I know the target market is.
[01:37:14] The target market is my people out there that are getting after it.
[01:37:17] There's the target market.
[01:37:18] You know, there you go.
[01:37:19] I just hope I can get it.
[01:37:20] I just thought I hope this doesn't fall into the wrong ants.
[01:37:25] What if criminal, criminally-minded people or people that are, you know, have evil thoughts?
[01:37:30] Maybe they start drinking white tea.
[01:37:32] We might be in trouble.
[01:37:33] Yeah.
[01:37:34] We might have to bolster up and drink more white tea.
[01:37:36] Yeah, or they could switch over to the old discipline equals freedom, kind of situation.
[01:37:40] And, you know, I'm just saying, theoretically, that could be something.
[01:37:43] Yeah.
[01:37:44] They're good.
[01:37:45] This is good, man.
[01:37:46] It looks good.
[01:37:47] Yep.
[01:37:48] Pretty good.
[01:37:49] Pretty good.
[01:37:50] All right.
[01:37:51] Cool.
[01:37:52] Jocco-white tea.
[01:37:53] You know what?
[01:37:54] On Amazon.com.
[01:37:54] After you click through, click through.
[01:37:56] Yeah.
[01:37:57] Which, you know, there's a whole tail behind the click through right now.
[01:38:00] Yeah.
[01:38:01] Yeah.
[01:38:02] It's kind of, and we have to make sure, because that's one of the main ways to support
[01:38:05] the podcast, is to click through.
[01:38:08] But if in the past you saved, first of all, if you had the true, the true, the true
[01:38:12] is no-in-void.
[01:38:14] We got shut down by Amazon.
[01:38:15] It was, let's just say they didn't really like it that much.
[01:38:17] They didn't like that much, because I've been proven wrong in the world.
[01:38:21] This is one of the times I've been wrong.
[01:38:23] There is such a thing as getting after it too much.
[01:38:25] Yeah.
[01:38:26] And apparently we were getting after it.
[01:38:27] Troopers were getting after it too much with the true, but tool.
[01:38:30] So they shut down the true, but tool.
[01:38:32] Okay.
[01:38:33] So if you're still having the true, I don't know if it's still work.
[01:38:35] But if you're still having it, you think you're using it.
[01:38:37] You're not supporting the podcast.
[01:38:39] So what you have to do.
[01:38:40] And also if you have your old link saved that would click you into Amazon.
[01:38:47] And you thought, oh, I just used this.
[01:38:48] And I'll just save the, what's that called a favorite?
[01:38:50] If you made it a favorite part of it.
[01:38:51] Before, if you bookmarked it, then you got to erase that bookmark.
[01:38:56] You got to go back to jockelpodcast.com or back to jockelstore.com.
[01:39:00] And you've got to make a new bookmark that has the new click through the Amazon.
[01:39:05] So we can get Amazon back in the game supporting the podcast.
[01:39:09] So again, it's not costing you anything.
[01:39:11] All it's going to cost you is that short period of time to click through.
[01:39:14] And that way we can support the podcast.
[01:39:15] That way we can buy more knives for the table.
[01:39:19] Yep.
[01:39:20] And that's what we're looking to do.
[01:39:21] Yeah.
[01:39:22] And Amazon's not mad at us.
[01:39:23] They were just like, hey, the true, true, true, true.
[01:39:25] Too heavy.
[01:39:26] It's too heavy.
[01:39:27] Mm-hmm.
[01:39:28] It's like when, what was that book we just did where the Germans were mad.
[01:39:32] The Americans were getting after too much.
[01:39:34] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:39:35] This is unethical.
[01:39:36] Like theoretically from Amazon's perspective, like the Nazis, they thought, man,
[01:39:42] these guys are getting after this.
[01:39:43] Too much.
[01:39:44] This true, true, true thing is, we must arrest.
[01:39:46] So there's no more true bookmark from from jockelpodcast.com or from the jockelstore.com.
[01:39:58] All right.
[01:39:59] So that's good.
[01:40:00] That was a really good analogy right there by the way.
[01:40:02] The Nazis.
[01:40:03] Yeah.
[01:40:04] It's good.
[01:40:05] I'm not trying to say,
[01:40:06] it was fascist in what Amazon did.
[01:40:08] No, because it wasn't.
[01:40:10] You know what?
[01:40:11] It's a great, it actually really is truly a great program.
[01:40:14] Yeah.
[01:40:14] It really is a great program.
[01:40:15] It's very supportive of us.
[01:40:17] And it's cool for Amazon because people are ordering stuff through Amazon.
[01:40:20] I love it by and stuff and doing it through our website makes me feel good.
[01:40:25] It's like another excuse to just buy more books.
[01:40:28] I'm buying books at a ridiculous rate right now.
[01:40:30] It's actually, it's almost embarrassing.
[01:40:32] How many books I'm buying right now?
[01:40:34] Because everybody recommends me a book.
[01:40:36] And I used to say, well, maybe I'll take a look at it.
[01:40:38] I don't have time to do that anymore.
[01:40:38] Now I just order it.
[01:40:39] Just bring it to me.
[01:40:41] Amazon.
[01:40:41] I want it today.
[01:40:42] Yeah.
[01:40:43] Yeah.
[01:40:44] How cool is that?
[01:40:45] Yeah.
[01:40:46] Amazon Prime.
[01:40:47] Same day delivery.
[01:40:48] Bring me my books.
[01:40:49] Yeah.
[01:40:50] You know what else is cool?
[01:40:51] So I was going to mark up the book, the glory of the trenches.
[01:40:56] But I didn't want to mark it up obviously because it's an old beautiful copy.
[01:40:59] So I bought a new one.
[01:41:00] Okay.
[01:41:01] Now when you buy these certain books from Amazon,
[01:41:06] they print them immediately.
[01:41:08] All right.
[01:41:09] So this book has got printed on the 22nd of September for me.
[01:41:13] And then I just ordered it.
[01:41:13] So I could mark this one up.
[01:41:15] Yeah.
[01:41:16] It didn't arrive before I went on my trip.
[01:41:17] So I did it on another copy.
[01:41:20] So anyways.
[01:41:21] Yeah.
[01:41:22] They will print a lot of these books that we're bringing out, that are rare books, that
[01:41:25] are old books, that are out of print books.
[01:41:26] They just reprint them.
[01:41:27] Yeah.
[01:41:28] So you can get a book printed.
[01:41:30] They'll bring the ones out here on the West Coast are printed in San Bernardino, California,
[01:41:34] San Bernardino.
[01:41:35] There you go.
[01:41:36] And what?
[01:41:37] You order it.
[01:41:38] They drive it down that day.
[01:41:39] Oh, yeah.
[01:41:40] I don't know what, man.
[01:41:41] I don't know.
[01:41:42] It's awesome.
[01:41:43] Yeah.
[01:41:44] Cool.
[01:41:45] But yeah.
[01:41:46] If you want to support this podcast in that way.
[01:41:48] Which is a great way.
[01:41:49] And we really appreciate it.
[01:41:51] That's awesome stuff.
[01:41:52] It definitely helps us do what we do.
[01:41:55] Yeah.
[01:41:56] Yeah.
[01:41:57] Thanks.
[01:41:58] But yeah.
[01:41:59] It's on jockelstore.com and jockelpikets.com.
[01:42:02] Click through.
[01:42:04] What other ways can people support this podcast?
[01:42:07] Well, obviously, the obvious way is subscribe to it on iTunes.
[01:42:14] Right?
[01:42:15] If you haven't already.
[01:42:16] And also the YouTube.
[01:42:18] Again, and I say this all the time.
[01:42:20] I'm putting more videos on there.
[01:42:22] It's cool because I'll put little excerpts.
[01:42:24] You know, where, because people on Twitter and stuff, they'll be like, hey, can you just isolate this one?
[01:42:30] Sure.
[01:42:35] Or they'll be like, hey, release this excerpt.
[01:42:37] I want to make a video.
[01:42:39] You can get the videos from YouTube and stuff.
[01:42:42] So they'll be like, hey, episode, I don't know, 40.
[01:42:44] You know, the last closing thing.
[01:42:46] Anyway, so I'll put stuff, not just excerpts, but other videos other than the whole episode of the podcast.
[01:42:54] And when a lot of times when you do those, sometimes they're just excerpts.
[01:42:58] But sometimes there's other things happening in those.
[01:43:01] Thanks, sure.
[01:43:02] Sure.
[01:43:03] I mean, sometimes you make full new video.
[01:43:05] Like the good video where does this come from?
[01:43:09] Yes, yes.
[01:43:10] And I think just as I'll speak for the voice of everyone else, myself included and everyone else,
[01:43:15] that's the thing, this podcast, that's not named echo.
[01:43:17] I think we all want to see more videos.
[01:43:20] That's me.
[01:43:21] And I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to make that hint to you.
[01:43:25] I think I'm making it to you all while.
[01:43:26] I know it's hard work.
[01:43:28] Yeah, you.
[01:43:29] But you know, we're just trying to let you know, we hear on, you know, the listeners and the,
[01:43:34] and the troopers here, we all want to see a little bit more activity.
[01:43:37] Yep.
[01:43:38] And I think I personally think that the more people are subscribing to YouTube,
[01:43:42] the more motivated you're going to get.
[01:43:45] Yeah.
[01:43:46] Yeah.
[01:43:47] I hate to say relying on motivation.
[01:43:48] No, no, no.
[01:43:49] Because I know, I rely on a discipline.
[01:43:51] And I wish you were like, you know what, my discipline is.
[01:43:53] I'm making, you know, one video every two weeks, but I would see that kind of discipline.
[01:43:57] Yeah.
[01:43:57] Really?
[01:43:58] From the end.
[01:43:59] There you go.
[01:44:03] All right.
[01:44:04] Well, hey, we're one step closer.
[01:44:05] Yeah.
[01:44:06] And, you know, expect it.
[01:44:08] Maybe not.
[01:44:09] Today, maybe not tomorrow.
[01:44:10] But I'm on it.
[01:44:11] I'm on it.
[01:44:12] Oh, I like that.
[01:44:13] Speaking of being on it.
[01:44:14] Oh, look what you did there.
[01:44:16] Oh, nicely done.
[01:44:17] Nice.
[01:44:18] Deep on it.
[01:44:19] Deep on it.
[01:44:20] Um, okay. So on it, these supplements, we all know that.
[01:44:25] A lot of people, a lot of people don't think that I work out just because they don't see me.
[01:44:29] They hear my voice.
[01:44:30] So like, oh, I could obviously doesn't work out.
[01:44:32] But Jaco obviously works out.
[01:44:34] Jaco does take supplements.
[01:44:36] So people are like, oh, yeah.
[01:44:38] What is Jaco take?
[01:44:41] Jaco takes krill oil.
[01:44:43] Jaco takes strong bone.
[01:44:45] And Jaco takes alpha brain.
[01:44:48] There you go.
[01:44:49] Strong bone is from on it.
[01:44:51] Oh, yeah.
[01:44:52] Yeah.
[01:44:53] All right.
[01:44:54] There you go.
[01:44:55] So yeah, these are actual supplements.
[01:44:56] I take the exact same thing.
[01:44:57] Not the strong bone.
[01:44:58] I set for the strong bone.
[01:44:59] I love to one out.
[01:45:00] What?
[01:45:01] Shrimp tech.
[01:45:02] Shrimp tech.
[01:45:03] Shrimp tech.
[01:45:04] Yeah.
[01:45:05] Okay.
[01:45:05] There you go.
[01:45:06] Shrimp tech is is good.
[01:45:08] And I actually, we train today.
[01:45:10] It's Sunday.
[01:45:11] We train today.
[01:45:12] We train today hard.
[01:45:13] I did not take shrimp tech today.
[01:45:15] And I didn't feel like I brought my egg in the way I wanted to.
[01:45:18] So it's too bad.
[01:45:20] Yeah.
[01:45:21] No, no.
[01:45:22] It was good enough.
[01:45:23] Yeah.
[01:45:24] But I felt like I was breathing harder.
[01:45:29] Yeah.
[01:45:30] Yeah.
[01:45:31] Good rolls today.
[01:45:32] Yeah.
[01:45:33] Good.
[01:45:34] Taylor.
[01:45:35] Yeah.
[01:45:36] He's when does he compete next week?
[01:45:38] Yeah.
[01:45:39] Yeah.
[01:45:39] It's like, it's very similar.
[01:45:40] Yeah.
[01:45:41] He's good man.
[01:45:42] Yeah.
[01:45:43] This early on too.
[01:45:44] Even if he wasn't this early on.
[01:45:46] Anyway, we'll talk about Taylor soon.
[01:45:49] Yeah.
[01:45:50] Even more.
[01:45:51] But yeah, I get the cake.
[01:45:53] On it has the best supplements.
[01:45:54] We all know that.
[01:45:56] All legit because a lot of supplements straight up don't work.
[01:45:59] They some supplements rely on the placebo effect.
[01:46:02] Literally rely on that.
[01:46:04] Like that's its effectiveness.
[01:46:06] That's why it's effective because of police.
[01:46:08] Police, police, police, not on it.
[01:46:10] You can find out about this stuff on the website.
[01:46:11] But if you want 10% off those supplements that you're going to get.
[01:46:15] On it dot com slash jockel 10% off.
[01:46:19] Boom.
[01:46:20] I like it.
[01:46:21] So yeah, do that man.
[01:46:22] Support yourself at the same time.
[01:46:24] That's why I like to think.
[01:46:27] And then how about those.
[01:46:29] My what the jockel store.
[01:46:31] Jockel store has some new items.
[01:46:33] So if you look on Instagram, you posted a picture today.
[01:46:36] I did.
[01:46:37] I did. Yes.
[01:46:38] But now today is relative because when this podcast comes out,
[01:46:42] it won't be true.
[01:46:43] Yeah.
[01:46:44] Did.
[01:46:45] October 2nd.
[01:46:46] Oh, people are going to attract the date.
[01:46:48] Okay.
[01:46:49] Okay.
[01:46:50] My dad's birthday by the way.
[01:46:51] Did it happen birthday?
[01:46:52] I was father.
[01:46:53] Happy birthday.
[01:46:54] BC.
[01:46:55] William Charles Junne.
[01:46:57] Bravo Charlie.
[01:46:58] Because my BC on coi happy birthday dad.
[01:47:00] Love you.
[01:47:01] Um, so on my dad's birthday, jockel posted a picture on Instagram.
[01:47:06] October 2nd.
[01:47:08] And one of the comments.
[01:47:09] I just read it.
[01:47:11] Little while ago.
[01:47:12] Um, it says, hey, where do I get that good shirt?
[01:47:15] Or where do I get a jockel shirt?
[01:47:17] Oh.
[01:47:18] That's an interesting question, right?
[01:47:20] Yeah.
[01:47:21] Because there's only one place in the world.
[01:47:23] You can get that.
[01:47:24] Yeah.
[01:47:24] And we say it a lot.
[01:47:25] But nonetheless, you know, it's obligated to listen to me talk about
[01:47:28] Jockel store.
[01:47:29] Yeah.
[01:47:30] Really?
[01:47:31] People fast forward when they get to you talking about stuff.
[01:47:33] I would not, I have not surprised.
[01:47:34] If people do, I'm not surprised.
[01:47:35] Are they missing some nuggets?
[01:47:37] They're missing some information.
[01:47:38] I think they're missing some information.
[01:47:39] I think they're missing some good times too.
[01:47:41] Yeah.
[01:47:42] Potentially, sure.
[01:47:43] Yes.
[01:47:44] So, how they're going to know it was B.C's birthday.
[01:47:48] To that to do?
[01:47:49] Yeah.
[01:47:50] That's the other way.
[01:47:51] Yeah.
[01:47:52] Great point.
[01:47:53] Yeah.
[01:47:54] So, I would say it's a little fast forward through these, but do what you like.
[01:47:59] You know, what if you're on your way to go do some pull-ups or something?
[01:48:02] And you're like, the books done.
[01:48:04] We're done with the book.
[01:48:05] Hmm.
[01:48:06] Time to do some pull-ups.
[01:48:08] Then that'd be cool.
[01:48:09] You know what's weird though when you listen to other podcasts?
[01:48:12] Well, specifically, if you listen to Joe Rogan's podcast, which I do, sometimes they're
[01:48:19] just straight talking.
[01:48:20] Yeah.
[01:48:21] Which is what we're doing right now.
[01:48:24] We are talking about it is enclosed around some subject matter, because we're talking
[01:48:29] about ways to support the podcast.
[01:48:32] So, yeah, but it's still like I said, there's some nuggets in there.
[01:48:35] Sure.
[01:48:36] That are important.
[01:48:37] Yeah.
[01:48:38] And even if they're not important.
[01:48:39] What's funny is even if they're not important.
[01:48:42] They're there.
[01:48:43] This is what I think is cool.
[01:48:45] When I go as I travel a lot and I've been traveling on and I'm starting to meet just
[01:48:50] like, troopers everywhere everywhere.
[01:48:53] I was all over the world all the way from New Zealand to East Coast up and down East
[01:48:58] Coast.
[01:48:59] I meet meet troopers everywhere.
[01:49:01] And when I meet people, all of a sudden, it's like, it's like friends that you have
[01:49:05] inside jokes with.
[01:49:06] Right.
[01:49:07] Yeah.
[01:49:10] Yeah.
[01:49:11] And then they make cracks about this and about that and it's all from the podcast.
[01:49:12] So that's kind of cool.
[01:49:14] It's not just hey, get on here and get educated about life leadership business.
[01:49:19] War.
[01:49:20] You know what?
[01:49:21] Let's have some inside jokes that we can laugh at each other.
[01:49:24] When I show up at, you know, you're whatever you work to do some work myself.
[01:49:30] Yeah.
[01:49:31] Yeah.
[01:49:32] People come to the gym and they'll tell me good evening.
[01:49:33] You never stayed that.
[01:49:34] Oh, you like good evening.
[01:49:35] At least a quarter of the reviews for Jocquay T.
[01:49:40] We start off with Good evening, I go.
[01:49:43] Yes.
[01:49:44] Good evening.
[01:49:45] I don't even know what started that.
[01:49:50] I mean, obviously, I said it.
[01:49:51] I think you started it.
[01:49:52] No, I absolutely started it.
[01:49:54] But, but at some point, I mean, I don't know how else to introduce you, right?
[01:50:00] Other than to say, Good evening.
[01:50:02] Yeah, you just kept, you sort of just kept doing it.
[01:50:04] Yeah.
[01:50:05] Yeah.
[01:50:06] And you, your response is now standard, too.
[01:50:09] Well, what else would you say, you know?
[01:50:11] I guess you don't can't say much.
[01:50:12] Good evening.
[01:50:13] Good evening.
[01:50:14] Amen.
[01:50:15] I like it.
[01:50:16] I like it.
[01:50:17] I'm going to stick with Good evening.
[01:50:18] I think I like that.
[01:50:19] There it is.
[01:50:20] But to answer that question, let's say someone else had that question.
[01:50:24] Where do I get a Jocquay shirt?
[01:50:26] I'll tell you where you get a Jocquay shirt.
[01:50:29] Jocquay store.
[01:50:30] That's again.
[01:50:32] Love the marketing on that.
[01:50:34] Yeah.
[01:50:35] We got Scott Cree.
[01:50:36] We got Scott Cree.
[01:50:37] It's a store from Jocquay.
[01:50:39] It's online.com.
[01:50:41] Jocquay store.com.
[01:50:42] Yes, we have shirts there.
[01:50:45] We have travel mugs.
[01:50:47] You know, the kind you bring with you.
[01:50:49] They're not the, the sh- Oh, this kind.
[01:50:50] You can put your Jocquay T shirt.
[01:50:52] Yep.
[01:50:53] If you choose to, yes, exactly.
[01:50:55] And some, some bumper stickers that are kind of cool.
[01:50:58] They're on Jocquay store.com as well.
[01:51:01] And this one of the sticks on there, cool.
[01:51:03] We have patches.
[01:51:04] Okay, here's the thing about the patch about patches.
[01:51:06] Someone online saying, hey, get the Velcro patches.
[01:51:10] And I'm just not as familiar with the Velcro patches.
[01:51:13] We already had these other two patches.
[01:51:15] One is the Jiu-Jitsu patch.
[01:51:16] The other one is the Jiu-Jitsu patch, but it's all purpose patch.
[01:51:19] You know, you can iron it on, but you sew it on.
[01:51:21] Four inches by three inches.
[01:51:23] The Velcro patch up like that's a good idea.
[01:51:25] The Velcro patch.
[01:51:26] Let me get the same thing for it's 4x3.
[01:51:28] It's a Velcro patch.
[01:51:30] So it's cool for that.
[01:51:31] But you explained to me, those Velcro patches are interchangeable.
[01:51:35] The standard is 3x2.
[01:51:37] Yeah.
[01:51:38] Three across.
[01:51:39] So just understand the Velcro patch currently right now is 4x3.
[01:51:44] Did you get 2x3 in order?
[01:51:45] Yeah.
[01:51:46] So I got to, you know, I didn't finalize it, but they come in pretty quick.
[01:51:51] So just know, just be aware of the dimensions of the patch.
[01:51:54] If you want to do the interchangeable one, I guess technically you could put the 4x3.
[01:51:58] But we're not doing that.
[01:52:00] I'll get the 2x3 and...
[01:52:01] Don't encourage that.
[01:52:02] Yeah.
[01:52:03] Please.
[01:52:04] Yeah.
[01:52:05] Please not to give it to me.
[01:52:06] Nonetheless.
[01:52:07] They're on Jocco Store as well.
[01:52:09] The Jitsu patches there too, like I said.
[01:52:12] Rash guards are there.
[01:52:15] Big time.
[01:52:16] All on the Jocco Store.
[01:52:18] Somewhere on that corner.
[01:52:19] But they're there in full effect for sure.
[01:52:21] And they're good.
[01:52:23] Five emails.
[01:52:26] Today, saying they felt the 19%.
[01:52:30] Yeah.
[01:52:31] They've been performing.
[01:52:32] Allegedly.
[01:52:33] There's no alleged about it.
[01:52:35] Yes.
[01:52:36] How can you say that's alleged when people are, I factually felt the difference.
[01:52:39] Oh well, that it's just what they're...
[01:52:40] What they're just skepticking on?
[01:52:41] No.
[01:52:42] It's what they said.
[01:52:43] I wasn't there to witness it.
[01:52:44] Oh no.
[01:52:45] But if you're saying to tell you that a 19% improvement if they did not...
[01:52:47] But they alleged it that it was an allegation.
[01:52:50] No.
[01:52:51] I don't support you all that.
[01:52:52] Technically.
[01:52:53] We're falling out of grace here, man.
[01:52:54] When somebody tells me they got 19% improvement with the rashguard.
[01:52:57] Top get his fat.
[01:52:58] Yeah.
[01:52:59] Yeah.
[01:53:00] I would be lied to you.
[01:53:01] Otherwise, if you say, hey, give me my money back.
[01:53:03] I didn't get a 19% improvement.
[01:53:04] Yeah.
[01:53:04] That's good.
[01:53:05] That's too very good points.
[01:53:07] And with women's tank tops.
[01:53:10] I understand.
[01:53:11] It's fall.
[01:53:12] We're going into winter soon.
[01:53:14] Tank tops.
[01:53:17] I don't think that's a Southern Hemisphere people.
[01:53:19] Sure.
[01:53:20] Yeah.
[01:53:21] The West.
[01:53:21] Yeah.
[01:53:21] Because it's summer down there.
[01:53:22] It's going to be summertime soon.
[01:53:23] Down in New Zealand and Australia and South America.
[01:53:27] Yeah.
[01:53:28] And the Hawaii people as well.
[01:53:30] From Hawaii we don't know about that kind.
[01:53:32] And that's why you're saying, you don't understand what a hoodie is.
[01:53:36] Yeah.
[01:53:37] From Hawaii.
[01:53:38] Like we kind of...
[01:53:39] We know what a hoodie is.
[01:53:41] Yeah.
[01:53:41] We don't know what a hoodie is.
[01:53:42] We don't know.
[01:53:43] Yeah.
[01:53:44] So we're making hoodies.
[01:53:44] Yes.
[01:53:45] So we made it with consultation from Jocco and then some New England people.
[01:53:50] We got hoodies on the way as well.
[01:53:54] And women's t-shirts as well.
[01:53:57] Yeah.
[01:53:58] I was explaining to Echo that in New England.
[01:54:00] Like a hoodie is like something you wear every single day for nine months out of the year.
[01:54:09] You wear a hoodie.
[01:54:10] Yeah.
[01:54:11] Oh.
[01:54:12] I'm waking up.
[01:54:13] I'm putting on a hoodie.
[01:54:14] Yeah.
[01:54:15] That's what you do.
[01:54:16] Yes.
[01:54:17] So we got to make.
[01:54:19] And representing with their hoodie.
[01:54:22] And they'll be toasty or.
[01:54:23] Yeah.
[01:54:24] Which.
[01:54:25] Interesting for Echo Better Term.
[01:54:27] My wife is one of those hoodie people.
[01:54:30] You know the kind of where she wears a hoodie every single day.
[01:54:32] Even when it's not cold.
[01:54:34] Hmm.
[01:54:35] She'll be like, it's like a comfort zone thing, you know.
[01:54:37] It's just a bunch of them.
[01:54:38] But I don't even know how many.
[01:54:40] She even took Greg trains victory hoodie.
[01:54:44] Oh.
[01:54:45] And she uses Alan.
[01:54:46] That one of her many.
[01:54:47] Anyway.
[01:54:48] That's a good ho it.
[01:54:49] That was got those are good.
[01:54:50] Yeah.
[01:54:51] Yeah.
[01:54:52] So yeah.
[01:54:53] So there it is.
[01:54:54] We're going to have that coming out.
[01:54:55] That should be within the next two to three weeks.
[01:54:58] I think that's a fair amount of time to say.
[01:55:01] And it be accurate.
[01:55:02] So there it is.
[01:55:04] JoccoStore.com in the event of you wanting to support this podcast in that way.
[01:55:08] Get some stuff.
[01:55:09] Get a lot of things.
[01:55:10] Two things.
[01:55:11] Whatever you want.
[01:55:12] Once again appreciate all that support.
[01:55:14] So if you want, if you don't have a book that is written by a guy named Lave Babin, my brother
[01:55:20] and myself, we wrote a book.
[01:55:22] Call the stream ownership.
[01:55:23] Even you want to pick it up.
[01:55:24] You can pick it up.
[01:55:25] You know, an Amazon or anywhere else at the cell books.
[01:55:29] And we get so much good feedback on it.
[01:55:31] It's awesome.
[01:55:32] I appreciate all the positive feedback.
[01:55:34] You know, people read it and they say, this really helped me.
[01:55:38] You know, not just with the way I'm doing my business.
[01:55:41] But like with the normal stuff in the life.
[01:55:43] And the other cool thing is when people buy it for their team.
[01:55:45] You know, or they even buy it for the boss sometimes.
[01:55:48] So pick up extreme ownership.
[01:55:50] We did the audio to if you want to read it.
[01:55:52] If you don't want to read it because you know, time you just want to listen to it while you're in the in the traffic jam.
[01:55:56] Then just buy the audio book and you'll be good to go.
[01:55:59] So appreciate that.
[01:56:00] And then also if you dig that extreme ownership, you dig that concept.
[01:56:04] You can come out to something we're having here in Southern California in San Diego called the
[01:56:09] Master, the extreme ownership master. We're going to be talking about leadership.
[01:56:13] We're going to be talking about how to take the lessons that we learned in combat, which have been proven in combat.
[01:56:19] And how you can apply those same lessons doing leadership in business leadership in life.
[01:56:25] So we got a bunch of you are coming to us.
[01:56:28] And it's awesome.
[01:56:30] So and I had somebody email me the other day.
[01:56:34] And it said, say, hey, listen, I just wanted to let you know.
[01:56:38] I don't come into the master, but in the event, I don't get to meet you there.
[01:56:42] Then, you know, I just want to let you know.
[01:56:44] I really appreciate, you know, the podcast and the book and all that.
[01:56:48] And I didn't even respond yet.
[01:56:49] I don't think I could a lot of emails.
[01:56:51] But let me tell you something.
[01:56:52] If you come to the master, we're hanging out.
[01:56:54] It's not going to be one of these gigs where, you know, I'm back in the green room.
[01:56:58] We're going to go out, um, getting in character.
[01:57:00] Well, no, I, this is my character.
[01:57:03] And I won't be backstage.
[01:57:04] I'll be in, I'll be sitting at a table with you.
[01:57:06] I'll be talking. I'll be, and lace can be doing the same thing.
[01:57:09] So that's one of the major differentiators we want to have in this thing is that,
[01:57:14] because, you know, late for night go to these events all the time because we speak at them.
[01:57:17] You know, leadership events and conferences and all that.
[01:57:20] The biggest differentiator that we want to make is we want to be.
[01:57:23] We want to have the contact.
[01:57:25] We want to have the face to face.
[01:57:26] So if you're coming, not only are you going to meet me, we're going to kick it.
[01:57:31] We're going to be hanging out.
[01:57:32] We're going to be having dinner lunch.
[01:57:33] We're going to be going over problems when we talk about solutions.
[01:57:35] So don't think that I'm going to be.
[01:57:38] And that, and that late for is going to be all hiding in the background.
[01:57:41] No, we're going to be there.
[01:57:42] I'll be meeting you.
[01:57:43] Will we do an workout also?
[01:57:44] Some people want to try.
[01:57:45] If you train that you get to and you come out here.
[01:57:48] Come out here a little bit early or stay a little bit late.
[01:57:51] And we're going to go to the gym.
[01:57:53] We're going to go to the victory MMA.
[01:57:54] And you can challenge echelotronals to a death match.
[01:57:57] The other node will be there.
[01:57:59] We'll be there rolling.
[01:58:00] So, you know, if you, if you, if you stay Friday, if you stay Saturday,
[01:58:04] if you stay Sunday, I will be there Friday night.
[01:58:08] I'll be there Saturday day.
[01:58:09] I'll be there Sunday day.
[01:58:10] And we'll be getting it on.
[01:58:12] So come on out for that for that monster.
[01:58:16] And that'll be that'll be awesome.
[01:58:18] Also, if you can't come out to the monster,
[01:58:21] but you just want to kind of kick it and keep these things going on.
[01:58:25] And you want to join the crew.
[01:58:27] Then all you got to do is get on social media,
[01:58:32] which, which, which, which, I didn't really understand social media a year ago.
[01:58:37] You know, I didn't know what it was all about.
[01:58:39] But now what I know is I get to talk to people and I get to get to grow my knowledge from other people
[01:58:45] who, who can communicate things, who ask really good questions that I got to get research or I know an answer to
[01:58:50] and then they ask me something else and so, so that's awesome.
[01:58:53] And funny bunch of people post all kinds of funny stuff.
[01:58:56] So I'm getting entertained.
[01:58:58] And we're getting, you know, a crew.
[01:59:01] And having a bunch of people there that are like-minded and is, is, is fun to have.
[01:59:06] And so I appreciate it. If you want to find us on social media.
[01:59:09] Echo is, by the way, he's at Echo Charles.
[01:59:13] And that's on Instagram. That's on Twitter.

[01:59:19] And I am also on social media.
[01:59:25] And I am at Jockel Willink on Twitter on Instagram on the Facebookie.
[01:59:30] I am also there.
[01:59:33] And I guess that's about it for this week.
[01:59:39] We don't think we have time for the Q&A.
[01:59:43] We'll push that.
[01:59:45] And in the meantime, you know, again, I know we got to- I'm meeting people all over the place.

[02:00:09] Thank all of you.
[02:00:11] You all you uniform folks were what you do for home-aligned overseas and here at home.
[02:00:16] And for everybody else that I'm meeting, I'm meeting people from all kinds of businesses.
[02:00:20] All of you have goals.
[02:00:21] You're trying to make things happen.
[02:00:23] You're not calling, you're not calling us up.
[02:00:25] You're not calling life and I help unless you're trying to dominate.
[02:00:28] So we love the fact that we get to go to places where you got people that are out there trying to kick ass,
[02:00:34] trying to crush it.
[02:00:35] And that's what propels American keeps our country strong, keeps our country free.
[02:00:40] So thank you for what you're doing in all those jobs, all you in the workforce.
[02:00:46] It's awesome.
