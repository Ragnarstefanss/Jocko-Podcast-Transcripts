yeah I love the fact that we like we we're calling the jeans legit fit you know now while we're doing all this meanwhile I'm out starting jockel publishing you know I have a I'm like hey man by the way I've got you know whatever I'm gonna be I got 100,000 books that you know I'm gonna need to get moved from place to place we have a fulfillment center like you're like but this this thing of sitting in front of somebody and having a conversation and building relationships what I found in this shoe making thing is the most important thing because these are still the guys running it the same guys running it in the in the in the dudes these shoe dogs that have been in the factory helping us combine age 88 90 and we've probably had a dozen in there and you should see their freaking eyeballs when they walk in they don't want to leave honestly on occasion bringing tears to their eyes that that this is what we're doing because they saw it they were part of it and they saw it leave and just that spark man like you know I'm honestly just hit me it's me right in the feels man that spark they see it's motivation and I absolutely knew that were there support it was going to be possible and so we've been grinding this the first pair of boots that that I got that you sent me the first pair of the boots you sent me it was better than the first pair of jeans you sent me that that was a shocker to me like it was like take them out of the box I was like no way this is ridiculous and and you know you're like I do like I do like both but for me I like when you're talking but for echo I like when things explode like when you're like that's a good idea hopefully they don't like pull down you're post on they're post on Instagram but like the other day when you're like and I said yeah he goes take it all loaded up a tractor trailer of machinery a small if I can 20 foot you know and a couple weeks ago Joe my father learned I and a few other guys from the factory went out and cooked his whole staff a lobster bake lobster bake for old shoe machinery but these shoe dogs so shoe dog is the term that is just used it's a general term for someone who's been in the industry for a long time but you know as we were talking at the end of the last year and you know I kind of put your I guess concerns that ease a little bit for sure for no it's like we can make shoes you know we don't have to reinvent anything even though we need to build it from scratch there's a difference there you know if we're going to like try to figure it out and not have the knowledge that would be one thing but the knowledge has only been it's only been removed for 20 years right if it had been removed for 50 years I'm not going to say it's impossible yeah it seems like this is one elevation above that just one it seems like someone made this thing out of little right a vector set pieces that's what it seems that's what those helicopters feel like when you get in them and when you find them that's what they feel like if you don't like flying you're not going to be game for that especially with decoda track I will declare you as the climb plus you weigh 900 pounds so that would be like flying lopsided people he is a savage and we're actually going to get to do that and drink form the You could sell a pair of American you know standard American jeans that cost $16 at the grocery store at the department store and you could bring them to sell them for a hundred dollars I remember hearing that $100 and I had like two pairs of jeans or three pairs of jeans and I'm thinking hey can you take these can you try and get a hundred dollars for these things and that was and that to me has always said that those people over there identified blue jeans like the like you're saying the East Coast you look at the cowboy and said that's the spirit of freedom right there and you know the thing is is you know when I get into something I go deep that's why we ended up building a factory in my backyard it's a game changer product you know it's not it's hard to explain man like it like when you're underneath somebody you know like we're an old ghee let's say you're underneath somebody inside control you've been sweating the whole match your 10 minutes in and you need to like elbow escape or hip out and your arms stuck inside the sleeve because of the abrasion of the the text what you're gonna feel is free you know I love it you know that's truly my passion is being in the game not what the not not winning the game not winning the championship not looking to to an end goal like if we achieve this we've won you know it's it's just it's just if we achieve this what can we do next exactly where can we go from there exactly I look at one thing that I like doing and I like being a part of and one thing that I like about working with you is it doesn't seem like I can say because what I remember when I was a kid you know at my school like kids would go on like a school trip to wherever England or Spain or something like that like the Spanish class there'd be kids that would go on a school trip and what people would say is like you got to bring jeans bring jeans you can sell them. oh everyone has you know one or two a day like 5000 cans you're gonna go through 5000 cans this week on the house come to the immersion camp get some free jocco white tea all right big that also jocco as a store store of his own online store jocco store dot com is where you can get you know discipline equals freedom represent while you're on the path all right just pick them sweet them shirt with his head on it says good also short without his head that says good if you don't uh if you don't like my head That's the same theory that we have with EF overwatch With with hiring vets were bringing vets in look a veteran might not have worked in whatever industry you're in But that person is hungry they got leadership skills and they got discipline They end especially the group that we got we got they they study and trained in extreme ownership and the principles So they they know how to lead and We're getting the feedback that we're getting is phenomenal because people hire somebody and they go What they you know they feel like they're taking a little bit of a risk because the person it's you know and it's Rachel and the biggest thing that that built the infrastructure for the New England mills were the canal systems and if you pulled the stones out of like the canal system in Lewiston you could build another great pyramid if you pulled the granite out of these canal systems you could build another great pyramid think about what they did a hundred years ago in Lewiston Maine they built a great pyramid in the form of a canal system and they did it without technology they couldn't look up leg twist in jeans and solve the problem right we can so to say it can't be done I'd never say that we've got technology we've still got people that know we've got jets that can get us you know you can jump in on a jet blue flight and get to Europe in eight hours or twelve hours if you need to go see how something works or if I need to go to California if I need to just drive to low Massachusetts and I think I think that I think we're gonna have some challenges ahead of us because we've Expanded the three locations, but we've almost created a bermuted triangle of sorts the way that we Secured the locations the facilities it's efficient It's like lean manufacturing of you know in between the factories You know the way you can get from you know one point to the next to maximize Maximizer time, but You know the lab's facility is awesome and why we fulfill them 500 to 1000 packages a day out of there for filling Yeah, you know when you come safe well, you know as exactly exactly just turn it on because You know managing you know all these people managing you know the factory a couple of occasions and the growth right You know it's it's weird because you you got people who go through let's say they go to college to be you know business management or leadership Whatever There's so much potential and people who just want to work and be part of something There's so they find so much motivation in that I would rather have someone and When I do like job interviews I say hey like one of the first questions Are you looking for a job or are you looking for a career and that's kind of a loaded question right when I hear I'm looking for a career and I feel like jiu jitsu is like a spark you know looking at those matches like the spark like whoa wait a second I bet there's every type of political affiliation on the mats right now I'm it's worth the tuition payment I was going to say if we're wrong at least I'll be able to sleep exactly and I think that's what when you're distilled it down that's what it that's what you get right is you know you can cut corners in the way you start at this you can cut corners here there the other place but what is the right thing to do you know like with the genes what's the right thing to do well build the product that's going to last lifetime that's actually the right thing to do that will never fall apart and Yeah, we're gonna gather and Just like a beehive man just like a freaking beehive walking in that place in the morning We're gonna I don't know if you want me to say this or not about what about two we're gonna make another pair of jeans That's gonna be lighter weight now echo Charles. yes we do and boom all of a sudden next you know we we got a fulfillment center we got the warrior kid three we got Mikey the Dragons there you're we just absorb that it was like it was one of those things that I'll give me the freedom to tell my publisher watch this on publishing you know I got a publishing company now watch this and to have the freedom to be able to do that was phenomenal because I knew I was like It's like it doesn't exist until now and it's weird to say that about I guess it'd be I don't know what's a good what's a clothing product that like completely Change like it didn't exist and now it does I would say that's easy that that would be the compression shirt under I'm okay, I'm out with because we both like college football Remember we had the grades the cotton the culture and I took my wife Amanda to the The monster and DC and my father on La Jo and Brian our business partner came and his wife Megan and and we went through it and When you discussed this Does it always have to be a hundred percent like I feel like I'm gonna make a hundred percent decision Maybe that's a little bit of ego talking, you know, but I feel like my decision is always gonna be a hundred percent and that's the that's the important I mean it's a it's a beautiful thing really you know to that you can be empowered by something on your body you know and and people say well that's that's not it's not important you know what you wear well it's really not important what you wear but it is important how you feel about yourself you know it is important how you project yourself you know I would just kept shoveling your busy I don't think you even know you're thinking what is what is like the sweet Like part they're the the moist like they're really like almost wet part But as far as you know the psychological trauma of all the you know brain damage about this and that the other thing is very limited right now Which is amazing to see yeah, it is and you we're talking about people who weren't leaders prior to Origin you know nobody had a leadership position nobody had a management position You know and the the leaders that we've built There they're not entitled to it
