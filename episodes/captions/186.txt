[00:00:00] This is Jacob podcast number one 86 with me, Jocca Willink.
[00:00:08] Among the newly minted special forces soldiers were Douglas L. L. L. L.
[00:00:14] L. L. L. S. Skinny, 135 pound California Cowboy, John Shore, a blonde haired, slightly
[00:00:21] overweight baby faced kid from Georgia and Frank McClowski, a tough combat hardened veteran
[00:00:28] of the 101st Airborne Division. McClowski arrived sporting seat-pitch from a wound in the
[00:00:34] back of his head. This trio of green braids had completed their special forces in country training
[00:00:40] program in Not Train, the fifth special forces group headquarters. When a sergeant
[00:00:45] not train asked for special forces soldiers to volunteer for a secret project, they raised
[00:00:51] their hands. In short order, they were flown to FOB 4 in the northern sector of
[00:00:58] South Vietnam, I. Core. Upon reporting in, they were told that Camp Commander Colonel Jack
[00:01:06] Warren would brief them in the morning on the CNC mission in Southeast Asia. Finally,
[00:01:13] after more than a year of training for attorney, the game was on. How much better could
[00:01:20] this get? It seems all his life he'd been preparing for this moment. From riding,
[00:01:25] Brody O'Bronks and breaking nearly every bone in his body to wrangling animals for television shows
[00:01:31] like Dactari and Cowboy in Africa starring Chuck Connors.
[00:01:36] Let's turn on a little bit about taking a calculated risk.
[00:01:41] And after he had gotten his hands on Robin Moore's book of the Green Berets, he knew this
[00:01:47] was for him.
[00:01:48] Gorilla Warfare, Czech.
[00:01:50] Counter-insurgency training, Czech.
[00:01:52] Unconventional warfare, Czech.
[00:01:55] The Chernobyl couldn't wait to write his own story that he could someday share with his dad,
[00:02:00] a World War II B-17 pilot and former POW.
[00:02:07] Nothing however could have prepared him for the sight that greeted him as he entered
[00:02:11] the transient barracks.
[00:02:13] There, etched onto the concrete floor and forever in his memory was the charred outline
[00:02:18] of a man's body, a grizzly reminder of the 23 August 1968 attack on FOB IV.
[00:02:26] That faithful evening, North Vietnamese sappers in Viet Cong operated skilled 18 green
[00:02:30] berets in a carefully executed snake attack.
[00:02:35] The deadly side of Gorilla Warfare was brought home to him right there.
[00:02:40] He was in a war zone.
[00:02:42] The enemy didn't play by any set rules.
[00:02:45] It was an unsettling event.
[00:02:48] In the next morning, after breakfast, the trio walked over to S3 and chose their code
[00:02:52] names.
[00:02:53] The Chernobyl claskey and sure now became the Frenchman, Namu, and Bubba, names that would
[00:02:59] stick with them far beyond their tours of duty and Vietnam.
[00:03:04] Because S3 was temporarily located in the headquarters section of FOB IV since the attack,
[00:03:09] it was a quick shuffle into the briefing room with everyone else.
[00:03:13] An intense short, an intense, short, black-haired man wearing pajamas, slippers and
[00:03:18] a bathrobe walked in smoking a cigarette.
[00:03:22] Before a word was spoken, Colonel Warren abruptly pulled a white sheet off a large map with
[00:03:27] a flourish and tossed it aside.
[00:03:29] An announced welcome to C&C, man.
[00:03:33] Turning to the large map that had black tape, boxed target that it designators on it
[00:03:39] in Louss, the DMZ, and North Vietnam, he continued, this is what you volunteered for.
[00:03:45] This is why this is a top secret project.
[00:03:48] If anybody asks, the president can say we have no men stationed in the A.O.
[00:03:53] That is why you'll wear sterile fatigues and carry no form of identification of any kind
[00:03:58] on your missions.
[00:04:00] That's why you agreed not to talk to anyone about this operation for at least 20 years.
[00:04:07] Our intel reports land in the White House.
[00:04:11] Any questions?
[00:04:13] Not waiting for response, Warren continued to explain the difference between spiked teams
[00:04:17] and hatched four settlements where the different F.O.Bs were located.
[00:04:21] How F.O.B. 3 at K-Son was closed after the siege earlier in the year and how major
[00:04:27] Clyde sincere junior had opened a site at my lock now designated F.O.B. 3.
[00:04:34] Following an update on intelligence reports in the respective areas of operations, Colonel
[00:04:39] Warren asked if anyone had any questions.
[00:04:42] Colonel raised his hand, where do you need help, sir?
[00:04:48] We need men at F.O.B. 1.
[00:04:50] We lost a 10 on October 5 and some of the first special forces T.D. Y troops from Okinawa
[00:04:56] are returning back to the island.
[00:04:58] The Chernows' shirt turned to short and McCloskey and asked, how about it?
[00:05:02] F.O.B. 1.
[00:05:04] Sure not it in the affirmative.
[00:05:06] McCloskey said, no, I think I'll stay here.
[00:05:09] The Chernows turned back to Warren and said, will go not in toward shore, surprised at McCloskey's
[00:05:14] response.
[00:05:16] Without missing a beat, Warren told the remainder of the SF troops in the room that he'd
[00:05:20] be right back.
[00:05:21] He turned to let Chernows and said, follow me as he headed out of the briefing room and into
[00:05:25] the S.3 Operation Center.
[00:05:27] He told the center staff to get a king B.O.B.4 in an hour to transport the Chernows and
[00:05:33] make sure to F.O.B. 1. ASAP.
[00:05:41] He headed to S.1 and told the clerk that the new bees were to be processed and clear to go to
[00:05:43] F.O.B.
[00:05:44] And now we're later, PFC, Laterno and spec 4.
[00:05:48] Sure, we're in a king B heading north to F.O.B.1.
[00:05:55] And that right there is an excerpt from the book across the fence, which was written by
[00:06:00] John Stryker Meyer, nicknamed Tilt, who's a special forces soldier and S.O.G. Recon
[00:06:07] leader in Vietnam.
[00:06:09] And we went deep with Tilt on podcast 181 and 182.
[00:06:15] And if you haven't listened to those podcasts, then stop this one right now and go back
[00:06:18] and listen to those first.
[00:06:20] But if you have already listened to those podcasts, then you heard a little bit about Doug
[00:06:26] Laterno code name, the Frenchman, and you know that he was also a special forces soldier
[00:06:32] Green Bore, and was also a sog team member in Vietnam.
[00:06:37] And it is an absolute honor to have not only Tilt back again on this podcast, but he
[00:06:43] brought with him the Frenchman himself, Doug Laterno.
[00:06:47] The one in the on the gentleman.
[00:06:49] Thank you for coming on.
[00:06:51] Good to see you again.
[00:06:52] Good evening, sir.
[00:06:53] Good evening.
[00:06:54] Thank you for having us.
[00:06:55] I'd great to be here.
[00:06:56] Great to have you both here.
[00:06:58] And yeah, let's talk a little bit about how you ended up that I mean, you glaze over
[00:07:03] the book, we're riding rodeo, Broncos, we're working in Hollywood, Taming Ant, animals, what
[00:07:08] was your upbringing that got you there?
[00:07:11] Believe it or not, I was born East LA in the barrio.
[00:07:15] Well, that makes sense.
[00:07:17] Not.
[00:07:18] Yeah.
[00:07:19] I know.
[00:07:20] So living in the city, I got fortunate enough.
[00:07:25] And I got into high school that I got into a program called the Future Farmers of America.
[00:07:30] And it gave me a whole different way of looking at life.
[00:07:35] And I ended up becoming a president of the chapter.
[00:07:38] But I had several Spanish speaking and Spanish people in our chapter, one of the largest
[00:07:45] in all of Southern California as it turned out.
[00:07:49] Well with these people, I could became such good friends and their way of life in
[00:07:55] still working the fields of the San Fernando Valley, which was still open.
[00:08:01] I tended to lean towards the country way of life, even though I was born and raised in the
[00:08:07] city.
[00:08:08] And I do nothing about anything at all, but city life.
[00:08:13] But I tried to break away from that through the organization and the Western end of the
[00:08:19] San Fernando Valley.
[00:08:21] Well, one thing led to another, and I learned about you could go rodeo.
[00:08:28] And there was a place that I could go ride and practice where you could do boom riding
[00:08:33] and bronch riding and bearback riding and all the three were in San Fernando Valley.
[00:08:40] This was actually out in thousand oaks at the Paramount Studios.
[00:08:44] Okay.
[00:08:45] Yeah, they had a ranch right there.
[00:08:47] And the decouper is what it was called, in those days.
[00:08:52] And we could go out on the Wednesday night and Saturday and Sunday and ride and have jack
[00:08:57] pots and I got into it.
[00:08:59] And then one thing led to another, I got into college and I got on the college intercollegiate
[00:09:05] team and we traveled and rodeoed.
[00:09:08] And as I went through college, I became a dep to it and I got into rope and with rope
[00:09:15] and horses and owned my own rope horse and it just the way a life changed from being a
[00:09:20] city slicker to a cowboy.
[00:09:23] Where did you go to college?
[00:09:25] I started out at Pierce Junior College in Woodland Hills.
[00:09:29] Okay.
[00:09:30] The shaft for not a valley.
[00:09:32] And then ended up with Cal Poly.
[00:09:34] Okay.
[00:09:35] San Louis Abyssable, Mustanger.
[00:09:37] Yeah.
[00:09:38] So, through courses there.
[00:09:40] And but basically, we just just kept on going and then with the TV series, we're popular,
[00:09:53] we're a lot of animals.
[00:09:54] There was an opening to be a wild animal trainer at Africa, USA and San Canyon, New
[00:10:00] Hall.
[00:10:01] So, I jumped up there.
[00:10:02] How old are you at this point?
[00:10:04] I'm 20.
[00:10:05] Yeah.
[00:10:06] Okay.
[00:10:07] Wild animal trainer sounds like, you know, yeah.
[00:10:09] That's another day of college.
[00:10:10] There you go.
[00:10:11] So, I jumped up there and before I knew it, I was handling Clarence, the cross-sided line,
[00:10:16] and Judy the Chimp.
[00:10:18] And then they had a rope horse there that they used and they wanted me to call Dakota Duke
[00:10:24] and they wanted me to go out and capture all these animals by rope and them.
[00:10:28] And they knew I could rope.
[00:10:30] There's actual picture of me on the front of the pig and string that was produced
[00:10:35] out of landcaster and low valley.
[00:10:38] Of me on the front cover, rope and a tiger.
[00:10:40] Off of this horse.
[00:10:41] Off of this horse.
[00:10:42] Off of this horse.
[00:10:43] And that's what I did.
[00:10:44] And I rope the elephants and I rope, you know, healed them and I healed giraffes and I
[00:10:52] headed up.
[00:10:53] White Rhino form.
[00:10:54] There was a common attest and I turned them back and you know, they would do all
[00:10:59] these, what they call a veil, a veil would be open land.
[00:11:03] It's an African term.
[00:11:05] And we just would turn these animals loose but somebody had to go get them.
[00:11:11] So I actually got to work on the TV series that was very popular called Doc Tari.
[00:11:18] And people would see the trucks, they were zebra trucks.
[00:11:22] I went on YouTube and checked out some Doc Tari old footage.
[00:11:26] Oh, yeah.
[00:11:27] Classic show.
[00:11:28] Really.
[00:11:29] And but it was shot in like Africa but actually it was all done right there new all the
[00:11:33] soldiers, you know, at the compound.
[00:11:36] And so from there, we ran into a series called Cowboy in Africa and we brought Chuck
[00:11:44] Conner's in it and he was the star and he will Brian had actually done the original movie.
[00:11:51] There's of Cowboy in Africa and they shot it in Africa but here they're going to shoot
[00:11:56] it here in the United States.
[00:11:58] And so I got to work with ostriches and all kinds of different animals that they had
[00:12:02] to have around the compound of the house that he was working out of in the series.
[00:12:09] But one thing left to another but as it turned out, one night somebody handed me an old
[00:12:16] ragged book.
[00:12:17] It's called the Green Brava, Robin Moore and I looked out it and I read it and I couldn't
[00:12:23] put it down.
[00:12:25] And I said, this has got to be something that this Vietnam war has been going on for quite
[00:12:31] a while.
[00:12:32] I grew up almost listening to it every day.
[00:12:35] This got to be something going on that I need to contribute.
[00:12:39] And I think this is what I want to do.
[00:12:41] I went down the next day, very next day and signed up.
[00:12:45] What's the year was that now old?
[00:12:47] Where you?
[00:12:48] I was 20 and this was like September just before.
[00:12:53] It was like, I let's say because I went in September first so it was the day before.
[00:13:01] So August 30th of what year though?
[00:13:06] 1968.
[00:13:07] 1967.
[00:13:08] 1967.
[00:13:09] 1967.
[00:13:10] Yes.
[00:13:11] And I actually entered the service in September first 1967.
[00:13:17] But at that time he had obtained a college degree by attending classes at night.
[00:13:22] So instead of going through the four year program, the college was three years.
[00:13:26] Well, I graduated when I was 17.
[00:13:28] From high school, I was early.
[00:13:31] It was the classes at night.
[00:13:32] Yeah.
[00:13:33] That's fair time.
[00:13:34] And like the attitude towards the Vietnam war in 1967, you know, from the, I mean,
[00:13:42] when we think of Hollywood now, we think of people that just are, you know, just detest
[00:13:48] everything it has to do with the military most of the time.
[00:13:51] And you were kind of in that Hollywood scene hanging around with all these people, but
[00:13:54] that didn't rub off on you at all.
[00:13:56] It didn't happen that way.
[00:13:58] In 1967, 1968, it wasn't like that back then.
[00:14:02] I was shocked when I got back.
[00:14:05] And I actually visited Bubba on, on Peach Street in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:14:13] And there was an anti-Rally Vietnam rally going down the street.
[00:14:20] And I looked out the window and I said, Bubba, what in the world is that?
[00:14:24] He says, those are, and I wore protesters.
[00:14:27] I'd never seen it, never heard of it.
[00:14:30] But in 67, everybody was still pretty patriotic.
[00:14:33] God.
[00:14:34] And didn't have that situation.
[00:14:36] And now, what about your old man?
[00:14:40] Who was, you know, he was, you were raised as the son of a guy that was a B-17 pilot?
[00:14:45] Yes.
[00:14:46] A war hero in itself.
[00:14:50] He ran 13 missions.
[00:14:51] He was actually a first two missions in, were over Berlin.
[00:14:58] He was on the first two missions, the bomb Berlin itself.
[00:15:01] But he flew 13 missions on his 13th mission.
[00:15:07] They gave him a brand new airplane because his airplane had been shot up so bad with his
[00:15:11] crew that he brought from the United States and flew it over to England that they had
[00:15:16] to give him a brand new airplane that morning.
[00:15:19] He took off and he had 999 planes behind him.
[00:15:23] He was a point that day.
[00:15:26] And he went over a target called Shwainford.
[00:15:29] As it turned out, Shwainford had lost 56 airplanes.
[00:15:37] And this day, his entire squadron of 22 out of 23 were to be shot down that day.
[00:15:45] And he was the first one down and they were using new tactics, the Nazis were.
[00:15:52] They were line up of mission smiths and 109s.
[00:15:58] And in a row, in go right through them.
[00:16:01] Instead of coming around or going on top, they just go right through them.
[00:16:06] They didn't care if they lost the planes or not.
[00:16:09] And then they had, um, folk with 190s behind them.
[00:16:14] And they took out all these planes in the very lead just to start the battle.
[00:16:21] But nobody could ever figure out why Shwainford was so protected.
[00:16:24] And so many losses every time that was tried to be bombed.
[00:16:29] And Gary, during the Nuremberg trials, he admitted that it was the only ball bearing factory
[00:16:35] that Germans owned without ball bearings or war would have been over with in a matter
[00:16:40] of a few months.
[00:16:42] And this whole war went on and on and on because neither the British or the US could figure
[00:16:48] figure that out.
[00:16:49] And they should have bobbed it every day as what he said.
[00:16:52] And if they would, the war would have been over with, they would have had the surrender.
[00:16:56] But just the quirk in the whole situation.
[00:16:59] But my dad ended up being my first airborne person in our family.
[00:17:05] He involved in the military and we're involved in it.
[00:17:08] And Halo.
[00:17:09] And he taught himself.
[00:17:10] What else did you really find out?
[00:17:12] 10,000 feet when he jumped because his plane caught on fire.
[00:17:16] And they couldn't extinguish it.
[00:17:17] His engines were on fire.
[00:17:19] And he couldn't open the bomb bay doors.
[00:17:21] The hydraulic system had been shot up.
[00:17:23] He had a radio operator had a 20 millimeter right through his stomach and they had to put
[00:17:29] a parachute on him and just shoving him out the bottom door.
[00:17:34] And it was pretty hectic.
[00:17:37] The plane blew up in mid-air but those that could got out and made the free fall to the
[00:17:44] ground and pulled their shoots.
[00:17:48] And anyway, my dad was attacked by farmers with pitchforks and thank God the Kostapo and
[00:17:56] the SS were there to retrieve him and push the farmers back.
[00:18:02] He thought he was going to die right there in the hole.
[00:18:04] He sprained his ankle and he was kind of out of it.
[00:18:08] But anyway, they haul him off and strung him up and tried to make him talk and the usual
[00:18:14] serial number name and rank.
[00:18:17] And then they put him in Stahlog 1 which was an officer camp.
[00:18:23] It had 15,000 officers that had been shot down in that camp.
[00:18:28] All the enlisted men went to enlisted Stahlogs.
[00:18:31] And he served 13 months in the POW camp and then one morning they woke up and the Russians
[00:18:37] were there.
[00:18:39] The Russians liberated him and he was taken home and that's the story and he became well
[00:18:50] known for in our town or what he did.
[00:18:56] And I see how two brothers and my uncle Larmon was given a silver star of our patent, General
[00:19:01] Patton himself and friends pinned on his chest.
[00:19:05] And my uncle Eddie flew course errors.
[00:19:09] So the literal brothers were quite active.
[00:19:11] Okay, that's what they were.
[00:19:12] So I had a lot to follow.
[00:19:14] Yeah, he did.
[00:19:15] Jesus.
[00:19:16] So I ran there.
[00:19:17] I ran 13 missions.
[00:19:19] How ironic, right?
[00:19:21] That is.
[00:19:22] The ran 13 missions in one bright light.
[00:19:27] When your dad came home, what did he do?
[00:19:29] Did he get out of the army?
[00:19:30] Did he?
[00:19:31] Well, it was a Army Air Corps.
[00:19:32] And those days it wasn't the Air Force.
[00:19:35] And so he tried doing a little bartending and a little this, a little that.
[00:19:42] But he had been in construction.
[00:19:44] He actually was partnered up with his, my grandfather, my grandfather, my grandparents.
[00:19:49] And it was Laterno and Laterno construction company.
[00:19:52] And he filtered back into the construction and started building because they needed homes.
[00:19:59] Every all these soldiers coming home.
[00:20:02] And he built most of Burbank, Glendale at the time.
[00:20:05] And that did always did quite well and got into commercial buildings.
[00:20:11] And I sort of followed into those footsteps eventually after I got back from the service.
[00:20:18] After when you, when you enlisted, what did your dad feel about that?
[00:20:22] Well, he was not happy about it because he only gave him a day's notice.
[00:20:28] And I said, I'm going, I'm going into the service.
[00:20:32] I'm going to go to Vietnam and I'm going to be a green beret.
[00:20:35] But of course, when we, and I enlisted, they couldn't give me that.
[00:20:38] It was the only MLS that they could not give because it wasn't guaranteed.
[00:20:45] They could guarantee me anything else.
[00:20:46] They wanted me to be an officer because I had a degree.
[00:20:49] And I said, no, I'm not going to go to OCS.
[00:20:52] I want to go and be whatever it takes to be in special forces.
[00:20:57] As it turned out in the long run, whether you really want to hear the whole story, it's
[00:21:03] up to you.
[00:21:04] But I did end up being a green beret and going through all the processes and going through
[00:21:12] all the volunteer and being accepted and going into it.
[00:21:16] And I passed it.
[00:21:18] But during that time, I'm, you have to realize, I'm just an E2.
[00:21:23] I went in as an E1.
[00:21:24] I'm an E2.
[00:21:27] I'm the lowest ranking there is.
[00:21:30] And the MLS that I actually graduated with was a prized MLS that only a few would maintain.
[00:21:40] And that was heavy weapons.
[00:21:42] You can't be heavy weapons unless you're an E5 or a bov.
[00:21:47] But when my turn came up to go in front of the panel, my name being an L, that's made
[00:21:53] it documented.
[00:21:54] That's why I can say this.
[00:21:56] I was the first E2 ever to be accepted for weapons MLS training.
[00:22:04] Because I told them exactly what I had in mind.
[00:22:06] I said, come Monday morning, we've already gone through our phase one.
[00:22:09] And I've got my green beret.
[00:22:13] And I said, we need to go into MLS.
[00:22:16] And this is what Monday I can start.
[00:22:18] I said, when that MLS is done, it so happens phase two of graduation exercise.
[00:22:24] The one here go out in the field for two weeks in survival mode.
[00:22:28] I said, it will start immediately the following Monday.
[00:22:32] And I said, and I can be in Vietnam in the next three months.
[00:22:38] And they looked at me and said, you got it.
[00:22:42] So if you look at the orders, everything from L to Z, there was E2 E3 E4 was in my weapons
[00:22:50] class.
[00:22:52] Because I started something that couldn't be turned back, the tide had been turned.
[00:22:57] So what I got to Vietnam and my first assignment to FOB1, I'm now a PFC E3.
[00:23:06] And Pat Watkins, who has the DSC, the Stingray Service Cross from his time on August 23,
[00:23:17] when FOB4 was attacked, he told everybody, there must be one bad son of a bitch coming
[00:23:24] up here because he's a PFC, he's 11 Charlie S, SF.
[00:23:29] He's been busted down so far.
[00:23:31] He's got to be about a soldier working on the land.
[00:23:34] I don't know what I showed up and he looked at me, he goes, you are a PFC.
[00:23:41] This is how it's green, his grass and the new nut leaf.
[00:23:46] Just been trained hard.
[00:23:47] That's a good way to kick it off, man.
[00:23:51] Yeah, up on FOB1.
[00:23:52] Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:53] What is you going through the how long was the block of training that you, so you go through
[00:23:58] boot camp, how long was the SF training?
[00:24:00] Was that total?
[00:24:01] Well, I had to go through boot camp and that's where I had to volunteer to even be
[00:24:06] go through the acceptance of trying to be a sign to SF training.
[00:24:12] Then I went into advanced AIT, which is advanced infantry training, you had to go through
[00:24:18] that.
[00:24:19] And you also had to sign up for airborne training.
[00:24:22] So you had to go through all the basics and come out as an 11B, which was a small infantry
[00:24:30] arms.
[00:24:31] So anyway, then jumpschool.
[00:24:37] Yeah, jumpschool.
[00:24:38] But I went through the nomination part of it taking tests and physical tests and swimming,
[00:24:44] everything.
[00:24:45] And then interviews with the SF guys that were there that were in charge of selecting who
[00:24:51] was going to go.
[00:24:52] We started out with 350 men volunteering to go through this acceptance.
[00:24:57] They only took 35, and the end of the deal, I was one of the 35.
[00:25:01] I went on to airborne school the next day and went through jump school at Fort Benning,
[00:25:08] Georgia.
[00:25:09] They put us after our last jump, which was out of the old Boscar, 119s.
[00:25:15] And then they came in with the new jets.
[00:25:19] So I kind of proud of that.
[00:25:22] And we went on a bus that night all the way to Fort Bragg and got there in the early
[00:25:28] morning hours of Saturday, Saturday, a morning.
[00:25:32] And then Monday morning, we were information for our very first day of training and special
[00:25:38] forces.
[00:25:40] And that block there was two weeks out in survival phase one, then eight weeks of training
[00:25:49] after that, and then another two weeks of our graduation exercises where we're trained
[00:25:55] to overtake a government.
[00:25:56] That's what some of the forces does is actually overtake over governments and trained
[00:26:01] guerrillas to do so.
[00:26:03] And so then 30 days later, I was in Vietnam.
[00:26:08] Was the, I'm sure the focus must have been like a hundred percent on the, hey, you're going
[00:26:12] to Vietnam.
[00:26:13] We know you're going to Vietnam.
[00:26:14] This is what it's going to be like.
[00:26:15] This is what you're dealing with.
[00:26:16] And I graduated the Colonel, stood in front of us, the head of all of trading group and
[00:26:23] said, I don't want, I want to view to volunteer for fifth group, but Vietnam, we spent too
[00:26:28] much money on you.
[00:26:30] You're just going to go there and die.
[00:26:32] You stay here, pick any other group.
[00:26:34] I'm going to go down the line with the command sergeant major and he's going to tell
[00:26:38] me what group you want to go to.
[00:26:41] I had 23 graduates in my class, all but three volunteer Vietnam.
[00:26:50] He was not happy.
[00:26:52] What?
[00:26:53] I thought, yeah, you think like, why does why is someone during the Vietnam War going
[00:26:58] to join special forces or must they want to go to Vietnam?
[00:27:01] I mean, exactly.
[00:27:03] But in my mind, there was something wrong.
[00:27:06] It had been going on for years.
[00:27:09] And special forces had been there before it was a war, advising.
[00:27:16] And I just could not figure that out.
[00:27:19] And I said, I've got to go.
[00:27:20] I've got to see why is taking so long.
[00:27:23] It's taking longer than the World War II.
[00:27:25] Now it's five years.
[00:27:27] So why is it taking so long?
[00:27:30] So I said, I've got to get there and do something about it.
[00:27:33] That's how I, my attitude was.
[00:27:36] Friends, friends, come on, he's going to handle this thing.
[00:27:40] You see, oh, I see.
[00:27:42] Yeah.
[00:27:43] I'm going to go to the book here.
[00:27:45] This is going back to across the fence.
[00:27:46] And obviously, I told everyone to buy this because I've been reading chunks of it.
[00:27:51] And if you haven't bought it yet, just buy it right now.
[00:27:56] Written by John Streccharmire.
[00:27:57] So this is a section where he's writing about the Frenchman.
[00:28:01] So here we go.
[00:28:02] Within 24 hours, the turnover and store were on recon teams at F.O.B.1.
[00:28:05] And they immediately began training.
[00:28:07] Immediately reaction drills, weapons and explosive training, reviewing team S.O.P.'s, practicing
[00:28:12] helicopter extractions on strings and practicing wire taps.
[00:28:16] As October yielded to November, many of the members of the two recon teams began to build
[00:28:21] a rapport because they were doing so much training together on the food buy range.
[00:28:26] In addition, the turnover and store also quickly learned that the veteran indigenous
[00:28:30] personnel on their teams were highly skilled and fearless warriors.
[00:28:35] One night, while the turnover was recording a verbal message for his parents on his portable
[00:28:39] cassette player, LAP, the young point man on ST Virginia, came into his room and spoke
[00:28:45] into the recorder.
[00:28:46] I want to tell you parents of private literno, not to worry about him.
[00:28:50] We respect him and I'll keep an eye out for him.
[00:28:52] And don't worry.
[00:28:53] If in any of me shoots at him, I'll catch the bullets with my body.
[00:28:56] I'll protect your son.
[00:28:58] Thank you for sending you to him to Vietnam.
[00:29:00] He's a good soldier.
[00:29:01] That was, the kid was like 16 years old and he was our point man.
[00:29:10] Who knows how many kills he had.
[00:29:14] He was fearless.
[00:29:15] His parents had been both killed.
[00:29:17] He was an adoptee in the song.
[00:29:19] He was raised and lived in Foughton, sock.
[00:29:24] And he prided himself on trying to learn how to speak English because he wanted to be number
[00:29:31] one interpreter.
[00:29:36] Yeah, how do your parents like that?
[00:29:38] Did they ever get the tape?
[00:29:39] They got the tape.
[00:29:40] Yeah, I wish I knew where they were.
[00:29:43] They passed away and we couldn't find them.
[00:29:46] But yeah, it was amazing.
[00:29:50] And my dad knew right then and there I wasn't coming home.
[00:29:55] He knew I wasn't coming home.
[00:29:57] And he didn't, he had to try to keep my mother from figuring that out.
[00:30:02] But he knew that I would not be let come home because of the secret missions.
[00:30:08] He figured they would, the government would take me out before they would let me come home
[00:30:13] with what I knew.
[00:30:15] And lap was the kind of view that me, South Vietnamese ally that you never heard about,
[00:30:19] that we worked with every day and we're alive today thanks to them.
[00:30:23] We are alive, too.
[00:30:25] Oh yeah.
[00:30:26] We do.
[00:30:28] And a couple of canybee pilots.
[00:30:29] Yeah.
[00:30:30] It's true.
[00:30:31] Extractions.
[00:30:34] I have 13 string extractions.
[00:30:38] 13 for 13?
[00:30:39] Yes.
[00:30:41] Lucky 13 right now.
[00:30:44] So my dad said, he had 1,300 bombing hours, flight hours.
[00:30:50] But he also had 13 months in a POW.
[00:30:52] And it was a little shot down on Friday the 13th.
[00:30:56] April 13th.
[00:30:57] April 14th.
[00:30:59] No superstition here, huh?
[00:31:02] No.
[00:31:03] Yes.
[00:31:04] All right.
[00:31:06] Continuing on.
[00:31:08] A few days before Thanksgiving, ST Virginia's 10 children announced that an operation
[00:31:13] ordered come down from the S3.
[00:31:16] The team had a mission in the western section of the DMZ.
[00:31:21] And then I'm going to fast forward a little bit here to a guy named MacGovern.
[00:31:25] Quiet spoken, MacGovern gave him a riot half smile and said, we can't have that.
[00:31:30] You need to have a car 15 for your first mission.
[00:31:33] Follow me.
[00:31:34] The duo walked over the MacGovern's room.
[00:31:36] He opened his locker and pulled out a clean car 15 and handed it to the turno.
[00:31:40] This is a special car 15 he said.
[00:31:42] According to official army records, this car 15 was written off as a combat loss at
[00:31:47] FOB3 in case on, meaning as far as the army is concerned, this weapon does
[00:31:51] and exists.
[00:31:52] Some day after successful tour of duty and Vietnam, if you're so inclined, you can take
[00:31:56] this baby home with you because it doesn't exist.
[00:31:59] But as you can see, it does and it's a sweet weapon.
[00:32:03] It never failed me.
[00:32:04] And I know that since your weapons man, you'll take good care of it.
[00:32:08] Up to this point, let's turno and use an M16 for all of this training now with his car
[00:32:12] 15.
[00:32:13] He was ready to take on the world.
[00:32:16] True.
[00:32:17] It was a mean weapon.
[00:32:21] You see it in that picture.
[00:32:23] Yeah.
[00:32:24] The book has the picture of it.
[00:32:26] Yeah.
[00:32:28] And just rocking those 20 round mags.
[00:32:32] Every time I see those pictures of you guys with those 20 round mags, I just, I just, I
[00:32:35] just, I carry 25 of them.
[00:32:38] Stuffed into the canteen covers.
[00:32:41] We didn't carry food per se.
[00:32:45] All my food, I had zippers, sewed into my sleeves, up all my shoulders, left and right.
[00:32:54] And I would roll up, dry, dehydrated rice with electrical tape.
[00:33:00] Instead of one full ration, I took one full ration of food and cut it into five different
[00:33:06] days from maximum output.
[00:33:10] And we only ate once a day and we just put, we only had four courts of water because
[00:33:15] we didn't want to carry any more weight or anything else.
[00:33:18] But ammunition, we carried all ammunition grenades, M79 shells because we carried sawdough,
[00:33:25] M79s.
[00:33:27] And so that's all we carried was ammunition because when we go in, that's our supply.
[00:33:34] There's no resupply.
[00:33:36] It's all up to us.
[00:33:38] And many of the time we came back with nothing and had to resupply ourselves because we
[00:33:42] got down to the last bullet many times.
[00:33:48] 25, what was your load?
[00:33:50] Do you know how much you load out weight?
[00:33:52] Yes.
[00:33:53] My web gear with all the clips and everything in it and the water all that weighed 75 pounds.
[00:34:01] My Rutsack because I carried the radio, the PRC25, C4, Claymore, blasting caps, all everything
[00:34:12] that you needed and extra antenna, all that stuff inside was another 75 pounds.
[00:34:18] I weighed 135.
[00:34:19] I carried 150 pounds in the field.
[00:34:23] Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:34:27] That's crazy.
[00:34:30] But that was everybody's load.
[00:34:32] The endage are mercenaries.
[00:34:34] They carried probably 130 pounds.
[00:34:37] They probably didn't weigh more than 120, 115.
[00:34:42] Please.
[00:34:47] Continuant on.
[00:34:48] The opportunity arrived on Thanksgiving Day, 1968.
[00:34:53] After the weather cleared at the Qua Tri, Montesite, Quang Tri.
[00:34:58] Is that right?
[00:34:59] Quang Tri.
[00:35:00] Quang Tri, Montesite, S.D. Virginia, board of the King Bees and headed west to the target area
[00:35:04] with three American and four South Vietnamese team members.
[00:35:08] LAP, the 17-year-old hardcore point man who had run many missions.
[00:35:14] Home?
[00:35:15] Is that right?
[00:35:16] Yes.
[00:35:17] Home, the interpreter, Chau, the M79 operator, and Khan Cowboy Donn, who had fought valiantly
[00:35:23] besides Lynn and Black Jr with ST Alabama.
[00:35:28] As the second Secourse Keychurned Westward, 135 pound paterno went through a mental checklist
[00:35:33] of everything he was carrying.
[00:35:35] Montgomery's car 15, the PRC-25 FM radio, an extra battery for it, a saw off M79 grenade
[00:35:43] launcher, a 22 caliber high standard pistol with a silencer, ammunition for all weapons,
[00:35:49] hand grenades, gas masks, smoke grenades, a camera, and five special bags of dehydrated
[00:35:55] rice.
[00:35:56] He quickly realized he was carrying more than 100 pounds a gear.
[00:36:01] His inner thoughts were jarred when the door gun or test fired is 30 caliber machine gun
[00:36:05] without announcing his intention to anyone.
[00:36:08] Within a matter of seconds the King Bees cut power and began to tight downward spiral into
[00:36:12] the LZ where children's, the lieutenant, hone and lap were already waiting.
[00:36:18] The dizzying downward spiral ended as the pilot rev the engine and landed on the LZ.
[00:36:22] Chau exited the H34 with the Cerno and Cowboy following him into the woodbine connecting
[00:36:28] with the remaining members of the team.
[00:36:30] The King Bees lifted off and the LZ quickly cleared the target area and then there was
[00:36:36] absolute silence.
[00:36:38] So there's your first mission insert right there.
[00:36:41] My first answer, you talked about having a pressure time.
[00:36:49] I'm not knowing what to have for doing but we just dropped out of the sky nowhere.
[00:36:55] I mean it was adrenaline rush but you know I've been rope and tigers and rhinos and
[00:37:04] I've been riding bulls and Bronx and you know it just it just came to me you know but
[00:37:10] but it was I mean I'm here all my training all that time over a year and I'm here.
[00:37:18] This is it.
[00:37:20] This is the day.
[00:37:21] Now you question whether you're going to stand up to it because you know the enemies
[00:37:27] there.
[00:37:28] We didn't go there because it wasn't.
[00:37:30] We went there because there was a trail that needed to be followed and find out who
[00:37:34] we've earned in that trail.
[00:37:38] The door gunner test fire in that 30 cal just is a good wake up call the last bit.
[00:37:45] I'm sitting in the door this right over my head and not only that our kingbees were so
[00:37:52] stripped that they were so light compared to that regular H34 marineships they could out
[00:37:59] fly them in height and we could get up and over into those mountains and those high ranges
[00:38:04] and stuff and but they dripped oil and they had oil going down your neck all the time
[00:38:09] you know and then when you shot that 30 cal over the top of the hot brass it hit me
[00:38:14] in the neck I'm going all the gravity you know scared to crap out of the almost jumped
[00:38:20] out and I landed.
[00:38:26] Back to the book the audio contrast was startling as the turnover sense is adjusted
[00:38:31] the quiet he scope out the LZ which was in a deep valley between three junkled covered
[00:38:36] mountains gradually sounds of the jungle resurfaced birds chirping bugs humming after
[00:38:41] ten minutes children signal the churno to radio cubby with the team okay the insertion
[00:38:47] was successful no enemy activity evident.
[00:38:51] Children's move the team toward the first mountain movement was slowed by tall elephant
[00:38:55] grass and the only communication between the team members was hand signals the team moved
[00:39:00] in ten minute intervals stopping every ten minutes to listen to what was going on around
[00:39:03] it.
[00:39:05] After more than an hour the team finally emerged from the elephant grass as it continued
[00:39:08] to climb the first mountain.
[00:39:11] Bruno was on hyper alert his heart pounding hard whether sitting in a long rest period
[00:39:15] or moving up the mountain near the top of the mountain lap pointed out an observation
[00:39:20] platform that had been cut to the jungle high off the ground from that platform anyone
[00:39:25] could observe the LZ and the valley where the team was inserted as well as the other
[00:39:30] open areas that could be used for landing helicopters.
[00:39:33] Had a trail watcher been sitting on the platform when S.T. Virginia flew into the LZ if so
[00:39:39] where was he headed and when with the NVA hit the team.
[00:39:44] Late in the day the team finally reached the top of the mountain and found a wide will
[00:39:48] use trail.
[00:39:49] Leterna's first thought was how could anyone be out here in the middle of this in the
[00:39:54] middle of nowhere in this thick jungle.
[00:39:57] Regardless the team set up its night perimeter far above the trail where it could see
[00:40:01] anyone moving while remaining camouflage and out of sight.
[00:40:04] At last light, children's made the final commo check with Kavi as the team settled in for
[00:40:09] its first night in the jungle.
[00:40:11] It was an unadventful night.
[00:40:12] Children's did a midnight commo check with Hillsboro the night command aircraft that flew
[00:40:16] high above the Ho Chi Minh Trail and the DMZ and checked in with Kavi in the early morning.
[00:40:22] After the team ate breakfast and shifts, children's directed lap to move parallel
[00:40:26] to the trail with cowboy as the tail gunner in the line of margin and Leterna walking
[00:40:31] in front of cowboy.
[00:40:33] The team moved slowly in less than 10 minute intervals before taking breaks to listen to
[00:40:37] the surrounding sounds.
[00:40:38] They did this because moving next to the trail was fraught within her at risks.
[00:40:45] So there's your first night out in the jungle.
[00:40:48] Yeah.
[00:40:49] Relatively mellow.
[00:40:51] It was.
[00:40:52] But the mosquitoes were huge and we wore crevats around our heads.
[00:41:00] We actually use those fraternicates as more as we could pull them down over our ears
[00:41:06] and face and pick the mosquitoes out the next day because they were like cranes.
[00:41:13] And I mean, then you have to realize too, that's the first meal for an entire day with
[00:41:22] 100 degree weather and only one quart of water, a sip in the morning, a sip at noon,
[00:41:32] a little bit for the dehydrated rice at night and a sip to wash it down with and there's
[00:41:39] one quart gone for the day.
[00:41:42] It couldn't allow yourself to drink ever except on those intervals.
[00:41:47] And you didn't, did you guys plan to receply water?
[00:41:51] Did you guys look the maps and see rivers or anything?
[00:41:54] No.
[00:41:55] No.
[00:41:56] Nothing.
[00:41:57] So you plan to one quart a day?
[00:41:58] One quart a day.
[00:41:59] We think that is not healthy.
[00:42:03] I know you're a trainer but that's what we had to allow ourselves because of the weight,
[00:42:10] you know, a gallon of water is 7.5.
[00:42:13] So we had to judge our weight versus ammunition and that's what we trained ourselves to do.
[00:42:24] And not only that, we also took pills so that we wouldn't go to the bathroom either because
[00:42:31] they could smell you.
[00:42:32] I'm smelling American.
[00:42:33] That's why we had to eat rice and eat everything they ate.
[00:42:37] Otherwise they'd smell you.
[00:42:38] They might have to smell them or I can't see rations all that stuff, they could smell that for
[00:42:43] miles and they had trackers out there and you had to watch for those which I think you'll
[00:42:48] get to.
[00:42:50] But just that water ration is what you had.
[00:42:54] I trained myself for a year to do that.
[00:42:57] I did that all the time because we figured we'd be out in the sixth day.
[00:43:01] We'd come out in the sixth day so we'd have no water on the last day but we could survive
[00:43:05] the five days.
[00:43:07] Do you ever take any heat casualties guys that went down from lack of water?
[00:43:12] Actually never did.
[00:43:13] That's amazing.
[00:43:14] Never did.
[00:43:15] In the desert, we would even train in guys.
[00:43:17] We'd have guys go down like on a two-day operation.
[00:43:20] I'd have guys go down from lack of water.
[00:43:23] I've had guys go down in training in the state side but I never had any.
[00:43:29] Our guys were, we were, I'm just gonna say we were talking.
[00:43:32] Well, I jumped as little different than the desert too.
[00:43:35] Yeah.
[00:43:36] Because you're got shade.
[00:43:38] Yeah.
[00:43:39] Your triple canopy.
[00:43:40] So you actually are got shade over the top of you.
[00:43:44] You're not in open areas.
[00:43:45] You never go in an open area.
[00:43:46] You always follow the canopy but you have to move slowly because it's so darn thick.
[00:43:52] So it takes time and you have the tail gunners job is to cover the trail.
[00:43:58] Try to put.
[00:43:59] Everybody walks in everybody's footprint if you try.
[00:44:03] That's what you're supposed to do.
[00:44:05] Everybody has an area to cover.
[00:44:08] One guy turns to the right and the other guy turns to the left.
[00:44:11] The point man covers the 180 in front.
[00:44:14] The tail gunner cuts it to 180 in back and we train like that.
[00:44:18] We don't turn our backs and look at what the other guys doing.
[00:44:21] We only concentrate on our area and keep that area clean unless we have to move in that direction
[00:44:27] and we all turn that way and move.
[00:44:31] It's a precision movement that we practice.
[00:44:35] We train like that.
[00:44:37] Every time we were back in camp we train how to move.
[00:44:42] That's why arti Virginia and arti Idaho were survivalable teams besides having the luck
[00:44:50] of the gods with us.
[00:44:53] Sometimes you have to make your own luck a little bit through.
[00:44:56] We talked about that all the time.
[00:44:57] We would train all the time.
[00:44:59] We'd patrol around in the compound rehears, rehearse.
[00:45:02] We'd rehearse.
[00:45:03] We would rehearse in and out of the trucks.
[00:45:07] We'd have a big giant truck to transport troops.
[00:45:11] We do raids with those things.
[00:45:13] We'd practice getting out.
[00:45:16] If this takes you seven seconds, if you're in a firefight, that means seven seconds.
[00:45:21] It's all long time to be trying to get out of a truck that people are launching grenades
[00:45:25] at.
[00:45:26] We'd practice so we could do it quickly.
[00:45:28] Do it at night.
[00:45:29] Do it in the dark.
[00:45:30] We'd rehearse.
[00:45:31] Reverse order.
[00:45:32] That's what we do so that we'd be ready.
[00:45:35] We did the same thing.
[00:45:37] We actually working out of F.O.B.4.
[00:45:40] We had a island called Monkey Mountain and we go over there and we set up a course to walk
[00:45:48] from one side to the other.
[00:45:50] That's how we would train so that we could continually upgrade how we walked.
[00:45:58] You guys didn't talk to tell about this. You guys didn't bring mosquito nets in the field
[00:46:04] to wear over your head.
[00:46:05] Never.
[00:46:06] That would be what we had was what they called.
[00:46:09] Believe it or not, they had mosquito repellent that was US Army issue.
[00:46:15] But we also had Max Factor that did the makeup.
[00:46:19] Okay, what's that all about?
[00:46:22] The grease paint.
[00:46:23] Camouflage paint.
[00:46:24] Oh, camouflage paint.
[00:46:25] Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:26] Yeah.
[00:46:27] What we would do is take the repellent and mix it in our palms, squirt into our palms
[00:46:35] and put the grease paint in our palms and then put the paint over our face or cover
[00:46:40] our highlights so there's no reflections.
[00:46:43] Besides that, I used electrical tape and wrapped up my trousers at the bottom around my
[00:46:52] boots.
[00:46:53] So to keep the leeches out, but also that closed off.
[00:46:58] And then I also did that around the wrists of my arms.
[00:47:02] And then we wore, our car 15s were so hot that we had to wear gloves with a few fingers
[00:47:07] cut out of them.
[00:47:08] We looked like Michael Jackson.
[00:47:10] Way before his time.
[00:47:13] And was she a toy and about that grease paint idea like that?
[00:47:17] Do you didn't know that?
[00:47:18] No, no, no.
[00:47:19] See, I'll turn something to another.
[00:47:20] There you go.
[00:47:21] Yeah.
[00:47:22] So the mosquito, the repellent and the grease paint mixed together made a very gooey
[00:47:28] mess, but it would keep them off of your face.
[00:47:33] And when you were at night, when they were at their worst, you could pull that crevette
[00:47:36] down and then keep them out of your ears and they would stay off your face because they
[00:47:43] didn't want anything to do with it.
[00:47:44] And we always carry just a little extra with us to keep it going because being out there
[00:47:49] for five days.
[00:47:52] And most of the time we get shot out in the day two days, three days.
[00:47:58] But I had the luck of having several five and seven day missions.
[00:48:04] I was able to stay out a long time as our teams progressed further and deeper.
[00:48:09] They didn't think we'd go that far.
[00:48:12] But we went deeper than anybody could ever go.
[00:48:15] We got down to some of our missions and the layoffs with one minute on time with the kingby.
[00:48:22] There was no bring-in to sound once they dropped us on the ground.
[00:48:25] It was over with.
[00:48:26] They had to go back and get fuel.
[00:48:28] So no ten minute station time.
[00:48:30] There's just dropped you left.
[00:48:31] I had to.
[00:48:32] I had to.
[00:48:33] But they weren't expecting us that far.
[00:48:36] We could get right into them.
[00:48:38] Catch them off guard.
[00:48:39] All right, going back to the book as S.T. Virginia moved up the second mountain, cowboy
[00:48:48] and L'Eternaux began to hear women's voices off the trail.
[00:48:53] Cowboy orge, the turnote to go explore the sound.
[00:48:55] Let's turnaux shook his head.
[00:48:56] No, indicating they had to stay with the team.
[00:48:58] Cowboy who spoke broken English repeated the suggestion.
[00:49:02] Adding it could be a small NVA village.
[00:49:04] We could kill everyone and make the NVA bow-coo angry.
[00:49:09] We want to let them know we can hurt them the same way they attack our camps and villages.
[00:49:15] Let's turnaux again declined and gave him the handsignal to plant some M14 antipers and
[00:49:20] now mines on the trail behind them.
[00:49:23] In case the NVA soldiers were trailing them.
[00:49:25] As the team moved on, L'Eternaux planted a few more tow poppers and marked their locations
[00:49:29] on his map for after covering them expertly.
[00:49:33] He laid down some powdered mustard gas on the ground for any tracker dogs that might
[00:49:37] follow their trail.
[00:49:38] The mustard gas was left over from World War I.
[00:49:41] How it landed at Fouby remained a mystery to L'Eternaux.
[00:49:44] The good news it was that it still worked.
[00:49:47] The fact that it was confirmed during the next break when the team heard a dog howling
[00:49:52] anguish after snorting some of the old mustard gas.
[00:49:57] Maybe it didn't work that well because a few minutes later, the dog was back on the
[00:50:02] team's trail.
[00:50:03] Cowboy told the turnote to use his pistol to kill the dog.
[00:50:06] The turnote's mind flashback to special forces training group were instructors had said
[00:50:10] the same thing.
[00:50:11] The turnote pulled out the 22 quietly moved back down the trail, took off his rucksack and moved
[00:50:17] a few more feet before lying down on the ground facing the trail.
[00:50:21] The dog never realized the turnote was there.
[00:50:24] When the dog was about 10 feet away, the turnote fired one shot.
[00:50:28] It struck the dog between the eyes killing him instantly.
[00:50:31] The canine dropped in his tracks out of the turnote's view.
[00:50:35] On a wear of what had happened, the dog's hand, but removed up the trail.
[00:50:38] He got near the dead dog.
[00:50:40] When he got near the dead dog, he stepped on a tow-popper.
[00:50:42] The turnote and Cowboy heard the NVA screaming in pain and anguish.
[00:50:46] They left him behind figuring he would die shortly.
[00:50:49] The team moved further up the mountain with the turnote and Cowboy providing rear security.
[00:50:53] Again, the turnote and Cowboy heard women's voices below them.
[00:50:56] Again, Cowboy urged the turnote to go downhill in attacking the encampment and again,
[00:51:01] the turnote declined.
[00:51:04] That's so these guys are on you.
[00:51:06] Obviously at this point, when you guys are still heading up the mountain because you think
[00:51:13] you can get away from them and what is your point?
[00:51:17] What is your, what are you trying to accomplish at this point?
[00:51:20] At this point, we're trying to get away from the tracker.
[00:51:22] I've managed to take care of the tractor, but we don't know how many people are there.
[00:51:28] We keep hearing the voices of women's voices below us.
[00:51:33] Cowboy keeps wanting me to go down there with him, trying to confuse the whole situation
[00:51:37] because he wants to kill him because he says, it'll make him mad and they'll come after
[00:51:40] us and we can really get into it.
[00:51:43] Well, Cowboy just got off a mission on October 5th which is in the book where they decimated
[00:51:49] a 10,000 man division of all things.
[00:51:54] Eight and a half hours, they took down 85% of them with an eight-man team.
[00:52:00] Incredible.
[00:52:01] But it's true.
[00:52:02] They stack bodies up for sandbags.
[00:52:07] That's how many they were killing so fast.
[00:52:10] But he was insistent, but I totally can't do that because I can't split the team.
[00:52:15] I have to do it my one-zero says.
[00:52:18] I'm just a one-two.
[00:52:20] I'm low man on the tonal pole here, you know?
[00:52:23] There's even a lieutenant with us, but he's the one-one.
[00:52:27] He's actually below my sergeant because there's no rank in Song.
[00:52:32] That was one of the things that always took me back was there was no rank in Song.
[00:52:38] We didn't carry rank, we didn't wear rank.
[00:52:40] It was whoever was there, the longest that lived the longest was the 10th man.
[00:52:45] He's the one-zero.
[00:52:46] Whoever lived the longest was the one-zero.
[00:52:49] That's how it went down.
[00:52:51] That one-zero was killed, the one-one took over.
[00:52:55] You should take over the team from there on until he was killed.
[00:52:59] In the next one, the one-two would take over.
[00:53:02] He would cause he'd stepped up to the one-one position.
[00:53:05] That's how we progressed with our teams because everybody was killed as we went along.
[00:53:13] We were just lucky.
[00:53:15] But I did lose my one-zero, Guntherwald.
[00:53:18] And of course, children's went home and he was lost to an automobile accident.
[00:53:26] And so it's just, you know, but that's how it progressed.
[00:53:30] At this point, this is your first mission.
[00:53:33] It's like, I'm trying to do everything right.
[00:53:38] Yeah, and you're getting the full benefit.
[00:53:39] Like your first mission, you got the dog tracking you, you got the NVA encampment down below,
[00:53:45] you got the women's voices, you got the tracker coming up behind the dog.
[00:53:48] I mean, he's hitting the toe popper, this is like, and we know everything you were
[00:53:53] hoping for, here it is, here it is.
[00:53:57] And we know the NVA's there, because the jungle is there.
[00:54:00] Because the families are there.
[00:54:02] So we know, of course we're thinking too, maybe they're the tracker's families too, you know,
[00:54:08] because they would hire trackers, they tell the trackers you either track for us will kill
[00:54:12] you.
[00:54:13] And so they have no choices, because they're just, and it ended out there, living, trying
[00:54:18] to survive.
[00:54:20] So you're trying to get up the mountain, get away from the tracker.
[00:54:23] Was it possible to shake the trackers?
[00:54:24] Was it possible to like actually lose them?
[00:54:28] Sometimes.
[00:54:29] Sometimes.
[00:54:30] Or did you feel like once the trackers were on you, you were pretty much heading to your
[00:54:34] extract.
[00:54:35] Exactly.
[00:54:36] Exactly, because they were communicating in some way a fashion and let the NVA know,
[00:54:42] we fought regular Jews.
[00:54:43] We never fought the Viet Cong that they called the VC.
[00:54:47] We actually fought uniformed NVA and the regular Army that North Vietnamese had.
[00:54:57] But we needed to get off of the keep off the trail and keep going, because we needed
[00:55:02] to find out where this trail was going.
[00:55:04] This was our mission to try to figure out where this trail went.
[00:55:08] We did accomplish it in the end because I went on a second mission, which is later in
[00:55:14] the book.
[00:55:16] And I found actually went into North Vietnam and was inserted on the Christmas of 68 in
[00:55:24] North Vietnam on the same trail, but higher up.
[00:55:28] And that's a whole different story there.
[00:55:31] But we're going back to this story.
[00:55:37] Here we go.
[00:55:38] By the time the Terno completed his last radio called a cubby, the team was enveloped
[00:55:42] and darkness and team members began to set up a perimeter for the night.
[00:55:46] On broke without any enemy activity.
[00:55:48] When Covey flew over the team in the morning, he warned children that a team was being
[00:55:51] extrapted, extracted under heavy fire and another was being inserted into a top priority
[00:55:56] target.
[00:55:57] Sit tight was the last instruction from Covey.
[00:56:00] S.T. Virginia didn't move from its quiet spot alongside the mountain.
[00:56:04] During lunch hour, the member each member ate in shifts and L'Acherno went out to inspect
[00:56:08] the claim more minds.
[00:56:09] The team had deployed to ensure the NVA hadn't turned the deadly explosive devices around
[00:56:16] to face toward them.
[00:56:17] When he completed his inspection, L'Acherno found a log to sit behind.
[00:56:21] The NVA would actually do that.
[00:56:23] They'd crawl up to your perimeter and turn your claim to him.
[00:56:25] Triple canopy.
[00:56:26] You could pass them up within two feet of you.
[00:56:30] They could be two feet away from you.
[00:56:31] You wouldn't know it.
[00:56:32] That's how thick the jungle is.
[00:56:35] And you would see a foot.
[00:56:38] You'd say, come back.
[00:56:40] You might see a foot and you shoot the foot.
[00:56:42] If long as you shot the foot, you know he was down.
[00:56:45] He wouldn't go to supply dead in the hospitals.
[00:56:48] You know, you could count that as a kill.
[00:56:51] But you couldn't see.
[00:56:54] You just had to mow down the jungle.
[00:56:56] Open it up.
[00:56:57] Guess where they are at.
[00:56:59] The green trace is coming out.
[00:57:02] Give you a clue.
[00:57:03] Yeah.
[00:57:04] Yeah, it's just shocking to me that they would crawl up and turn around your claim more minds
[00:57:11] so that when you attack you, then you clock off your claim orders and boom, you're actually
[00:57:15] claim warning yourself.
[00:57:16] Later on, the CIA gave us a piece of equipment that I carried that had a little thread
[00:57:25] out of a box.
[00:57:27] You could wrap that whole thread around your encampment where you were A.O.A. is right at the
[00:57:33] moment and put it in your ear.
[00:57:38] If that thread was broke, it would sound a buzzing noise in your ear and you knew somebody
[00:57:45] came through.
[00:57:46] It could have been an animal but you knew somebody came through your perimeter and you
[00:57:49] just had to put it in front of all your claim orders.
[00:57:52] Then to stop it, you just let a batch and burnt it and you used the next day, the next
[00:57:59] type.
[00:58:00] But once I had that, my primators were always covered after that.
[00:58:08] Go back to the book later in the afternoon, children singled the team to pull in their
[00:58:12] claim or minds prepared to move out.
[00:58:14] Due to the combined weight of his rucksack and web gear, the terminal moved to his knees
[00:58:19] and slung his rucksack on his back.
[00:58:22] Just as it landed on his back, A.K. 47's open fire.
[00:58:27] Returnal was slammed to the ground, face first.
[00:58:29] The impact so severe he thought he had broken his nose, startled the terminal jumped up
[00:58:33] with his car 15 pointing toward the A.K. 47 gunfire that was near the front of the team.
[00:58:38] Surprised that there was no NVA near him, the terminal removed the rucksack to discover
[00:58:43] that 4 A.K. 47 rounds had ripped through the 23-pound PRC-25.
[00:58:50] He reached into an especially tailored pocket on his fatigue shirt, which was sewn with
[00:58:55] vertical zippers, one on the left side of the shirt and one on the right side between
[00:59:00] the top and bottom of the pockets of the shirt.
[00:59:02] He pulled out his URC-10 emergency radio and broadcast a general alert for any aircraft
[00:59:09] in the area.
[00:59:10] S.T. Virginia was declaring a Prairie Fire Emergency.
[00:59:15] This is your first fire from the enemy.
[00:59:18] He could shop in the radio for 4 rounds in the radio, knock you down.
[00:59:21] Yeah, I didn't know nothing.
[00:59:24] All I knew in my butt nose was busted.
[00:59:26] I thought it was anyway.
[00:59:29] Then I'm having to think what am I supposed to do and I was my first reaction.
[00:59:35] Meanwhile, my one zero-chilterist was mad as hell at me because he says, bring me that
[00:59:39] damn radio.
[00:59:40] He said, that hurt Tinnon could do crap for us.
[00:59:44] He said, I said, any work and I think it's shot up and I said, don't work.
[00:59:48] There's no signal.
[00:59:50] So I brought it to him.
[00:59:52] Well, needless to say, I was standing up what I brought it to him and he's laying on the ground
[00:59:59] and he grabs me and he says, can't you just get down?
[01:00:01] Well, the AK-40 set of rounds are hitting all over us.
[01:00:04] We're in the middle of a firefight.
[01:00:06] Our work returned in fire.
[01:00:08] Me, I'm still standing there in shock and he pulls me to the ground, saves my life.
[01:00:14] And he says, he looks at the radio real quick and he goes, the antenna has been shot off.
[01:00:20] That was the fifth round that went through it.
[01:00:22] A breach between my Rutsack and my web gear and pulled out my spare antenna and screwed
[01:00:30] it on and we had Kamo.
[01:00:31] That made you a good to go.
[01:00:33] That's fair condition.
[01:00:36] And we were just then Pat Watkins's flying over our company writer and he says, what was
[01:00:47] going on and he could see it from where his location was in the air.
[01:00:51] And he could see we were taking massive amounts of fire and he called for an extraction
[01:00:57] from Kwong Tree and they brought the Kingby's in the Gittos.
[01:01:01] We had to, you know, you can read the...
[01:01:03] Yeah, yeah, the once he got that, once he got the radio back for you to start working,
[01:01:09] children screams into the radio, we need an ex-filled now, I'm declaring Perry Fire Emergency
[01:01:13] is anyone out there.
[01:01:14] Within a second or two, there was a response, calm down, children's, I realized you're
[01:01:18] under fire set a COVID writer.
[01:01:21] Just at that moment, several AK47s opened up from the woodline near the log where LaTorno
[01:01:25] had been unsehermoneously slammed onto his face, lap and cowboy returned fire.
[01:01:30] Kovie writer continued, we heard your team declare a Prairie Fire Emergency on the
[01:01:34] Guard frequency and I've rallied the cavalry.
[01:01:37] What's your mark?
[01:01:38] Do you have an LZ inside?
[01:01:39] Before children set a word in the radio, he turned to LaTorno and said, see, it works.
[01:01:44] Suppose we have left it for the NVA.
[01:01:46] Never.
[01:01:47] I say never, ever, leave a radio behind.
[01:01:50] Because if to emphasize that point, the NVA opened fire again as a lap took, as that began
[01:01:55] looking for an LZ while moving the team down the hill away from the most concentrated
[01:01:58] NVA gunfire.
[01:02:00] Cutting LaTorno no slack, children's road, tell Kovie will give him a fix in five minutes.
[01:02:05] We'll probably need strings to get out of here.
[01:02:06] I doubt we can make it into the valley where a king be, king be, can pick us up.
[01:02:11] Without missing a beat, LaTorno who for the first time felt four burning stings in his
[01:02:15] back, repeated those words to Kovie while he and Kovie began providing cover fire as the
[01:02:22] tail element of the team.
[01:02:24] Then, LaTorno nodded to Kovie who ignited several clay more mines at the team and set
[01:02:28] out on his perimeter.
[01:02:29] Those mines only sold the NVA for a few seconds.
[01:02:33] Before the dust and debris from the blast settled, the NVA soldiers were moving through
[01:02:37] it toward Kovie and LaTorno.
[01:02:39] Without saying a word, the two men took turns firing at the enemy while moving down
[01:02:43] the hill.
[01:02:44] They were waiting around each other.
[01:02:46] Cowboy would fire several bursts from his car 15 and then reload.
[01:02:49] As he reloaded, LaTorno would open fire, providing cover, covering fire for the team.
[01:02:55] The classic cover and move scenario.
[01:02:57] Yes.
[01:02:58] Just the way we drill it.
[01:02:59] That's right.
[01:03:00] Oh yeah.
[01:03:01] And it just came natural.
[01:03:05] Believe it or not, it just came natural.
[01:03:08] What part of it just came natural?
[01:03:10] Just load and fire.
[01:03:11] Load and fire.
[01:03:12] And move, load and fire, move, load and fire.
[01:03:16] We had to get the team came together.
[01:03:20] Our fire power, you can only imagine what a full team of fire power with all car 15s and
[01:03:27] M79s and clay more mines going off.
[01:03:30] They knew they had a battle.
[01:03:32] But they were overpowering us.
[01:03:34] Yeah.
[01:03:35] I talked about this with tilt as well, like the determination of them where you think of
[01:03:41] the insurgents, insurgent army, you know, their rule is like, hey, we don't need to fight.
[01:03:46] We don't need to win this fire fight.
[01:03:48] We don't need to win this battle because we're going to be here for a long time.
[01:03:50] We can wait.
[01:03:51] We will fight when we want to fight.
[01:03:53] And it's the way that they attacked you guys and LaT took so many losses but continued
[01:03:57] to press and continue to press like their fighting spirit was high.
[01:04:01] Well, let me give you a backdrop on that.
[01:04:06] Maybe tilt hasn't even got to that.
[01:04:09] Most of the wars over with in history starts evolving in the books and people start asking
[01:04:15] questions.
[01:04:16] We find out that they've got 40,000 troops hunting us down, hunting sagers down.
[01:04:23] And there's a huge bounty on us.
[01:04:26] We heard 100,000, $200,000 to kill an American on a song team.
[01:04:32] And they had a kill an American award.
[01:04:35] They killed somebody.
[01:04:36] They got the award and the bonus and they were instant heroes and Hanoi forever.
[01:04:42] It meant everything to them to kill us.
[01:04:45] And they put 40,000 troops designated that we had tied up because they wanted to kill
[01:04:53] us because we did so much damage to go ahead.
[01:04:58] Yeah.
[01:05:01] Be kind of damaged during one short long cowboy again planned to claim more mine in the
[01:05:06] direction of the advancing NVA in Laterno dug out another claim or from his rucksack in place
[01:05:10] to 10 second delay fusing it.
[01:05:12] When the NVA again advanced cowboy ignited his clayborn mind, claim more mind.
[01:05:17] When the NVA moved again toward the team, Laterno ignited his fusing ran down the hill with
[01:05:22] cowboy to catch up to their team before they reach the team.
[01:05:26] To be 40 anti-personnel rockets slammed into the trees above them, showering them with
[01:05:30] a trap.
[01:05:31] A few more exploded as Laterno and cowboy moved down the hill.
[01:05:36] The 10 second, then the 10 second fusing ignited another claim more.
[01:05:40] It brought precious time for the gun and run team of Laterno and cowboy to cover ground
[01:05:45] and catch up with a remainder of ST Virginia.
[01:05:49] What you guys drill, pull and out those claymores with the 10 second fusing, hook them up
[01:05:53] and set them up.
[01:05:54] I mean, it takes like a little bit of time to do that.
[01:05:57] Did you guys have a pre-wrigged where you could just stick them in the ground?
[01:06:00] How did you guys do that?
[01:06:02] We did.
[01:06:03] We had a pre-wrigged.
[01:06:06] Everybody says, we can't have your blasting caps with you.
[01:06:08] You're just, they've hit the blast casters.
[01:06:10] You're going to blow you to smithereens.
[01:06:12] Yeah, but those precious seconds would mean.
[01:06:14] I had mine in my red sack pre-wrigged.
[01:06:18] There you go.
[01:06:19] Yeah, and with us with Baba had his pre-cut, so we had to fire second, 10 second, and
[01:06:23] then longer.
[01:06:24] And then you had to actually clock her itself with the full standard cord that you could blow
[01:06:29] it, it would give you more distance.
[01:06:30] How long was that cord?
[01:06:31] 50 feet.
[01:06:32] 50 feet.
[01:06:33] So you could put this claymore down on the tree and pull back and then you hit it,
[01:06:37] the handheld.
[01:06:38] Yeah.
[01:06:39] The portalized we did, and that one mission we were using the five seconds to
[01:06:42] Bubba put in.
[01:06:43] Yeah.
[01:06:44] But they were pre-cut and had them ready to go.
[01:06:45] So you just put the fusing pull it and stick it in the ground.
[01:06:48] Yeah, the little stakes, the standard, the black for things.
[01:06:51] Yeah, boom, jamming in the ground and you're good.
[01:06:54] Yeah.
[01:06:55] So you're setting those things up in like 10 seconds.
[01:06:56] Of course you always had to make sure they were pulling it the right way.
[01:06:59] That's indeed.
[01:07:01] Point towards the enemy.
[01:07:02] Front towards enemy.
[01:07:03] Yeah.
[01:07:05] Weed the back.
[01:07:09] Continue on us.
[01:07:10] She'll just call the an air strikes.
[01:07:11] Let's turn over, flagged it on how surreal this firefight had been.
[01:07:14] It wasn't like anything he'd witnessed on television or in any movie.
[01:07:18] Instead of men charging each other and killing each other in plain sight,
[01:07:21] here in triple canopy jungle, he observed green tracers from AK 47's first
[01:07:26] or at the most an enemy hand or foot.
[01:07:28] And somehow the NVA found firing lanes where they could launch shoulder held
[01:07:33] B40 anti-personnel rockets that slammed above and around them as they
[01:07:37] raised down the hill for their lives.
[01:07:40] Again, the voices of the special forces and structures echoed in his mind.
[01:07:44] They had told the young aspiring green berets at Fort Bragg that the NVA was a
[01:07:49] tough resilient opponent.
[01:07:51] Many had fought against the Japanese during World War II and against the French
[01:07:55] driving them from Vietnam in 1954 after the Battle of Dan B. N.Q. in North Vietnam.
[01:08:01] The sounds of King Bees in the distance and the crashing thunder of B40 rocket
[01:08:05] slamming into trees above his head shook L'Aterno out of his moment of introspection
[01:08:09] and turned his undivided attention to a crescendo of AK 47 fire from the enemy.
[01:08:14] S.T. Virginia responded with volley after volley of full and semi-automatic gunfire
[01:08:19] while the Terno and Chau fired several M79 rounds toward the dense section of the jungle where the AK 47
[01:08:26] gunfire was emanating.
[01:08:30] Through the gunfire someone popped a smoke grenade which brought the King Bees closer to
[01:08:33] our T. Virginia's location in the jungle.
[01:08:36] Over the Dan of Gunfire, children's encalboy told everyone to put their Swiss seats on
[01:08:40] and prepare for an extraction.
[01:08:42] In short order, a King Bees was hovering over S.T. Virginia more than 125 feet above the
[01:08:47] jungle floor.
[01:08:48] L'Aterno cowboy Chau in home hulked their de-rings into the old Maguire rigged that hung
[01:08:54] from the end of the ropes and shortly were being lifted out of the jungle.
[01:09:00] As the quartet of recon men was being lifted into the air, the NV only envied at least
[01:09:05] another salvo of AK 47 gunfire and several B40 rockets.
[01:09:10] Shrapnel from the rockets hit them with varying degrees of size and velocity all of
[01:09:15] them were wounded.
[01:09:17] During those explosions that L'Aterno realized as Car 15 and somehow caught in a rope above
[01:09:21] him, just far enough a way that he couldn't reach it.
[01:09:24] He pulled out his M79 and launched a 40 millimeter grenade toward the NVA positions.
[01:09:28] Now all he could see of the enemy were hundreds of muzzle blasts from AK 47's and green
[01:09:34] tracers.
[01:09:36] Green tracer rounds eerily climbing toward the quartet of S.T. Virginia men.
[01:09:41] Before he could reload his M79, the King Bees began to move away from the target area,
[01:09:46] surprising him because the men had not yet cleared the jungle.
[01:09:49] Instead of continuing to climb out of the target, moving straight up until the men
[01:09:53] cleared the jungle's triple canopy of trees and vegetation, the King Bees was moving away
[01:09:57] from the target area due to heavy enemy ground fire.
[01:10:00] In recent months at least two King Bees were shot down during string extractions from
[01:10:04] hot targets, but these facts were unknown to L'Aterno at the time.
[01:10:08] Shrapnel from the B40 rockets exploded around S.T. Virginia men, stinging them with
[01:10:13] bits of hot metal, further spooking the King Bees crew.
[01:10:16] L'Aterno began to violently collide with tall jungle trees, feeling like a metal ball
[01:10:21] in a pinball machine.
[01:10:23] L'Aterno caroomed off several more trees as at least one more B40 exploded in the
[01:10:29] treetops, again shouring him with trappin'al.
[01:10:32] A tree branch hit L'Aterno from the side and turned him upside down in his rope Swiss
[01:10:36] seat.
[01:10:37] As the rope began to slip down from his hips, L'Aterno remembered spider telling him how
[01:10:42] one zero from another team had recently been shot out of his Swiss seat during a rope extraction.
[01:10:47] Another tree struck L'Aterno before he was able to muster a surge of strength and momentum
[01:10:52] to reach up and grab the rope above him as his body finally cleared the treetop.
[01:10:58] The only thing between him and certain death below on the jungle floor 200 feet down
[01:11:03] was the single piece of rope tied into the King Bees.
[01:11:11] Just another day in salt.
[01:11:14] Just another day in salt, huh?
[01:11:16] And I had 13 of those like that.
[01:11:23] How did you guys when you're getting hit with all that and you're shooting back hanging
[01:11:30] from a string?
[01:11:31] I mean, that's just like completely insane that no one died on that rope on that extraction.
[01:11:38] And you're also spinning.
[01:11:42] Just the rotation of the mountain top, you get knocked around.
[01:11:44] The strings just spinning and the air is flowing past you and you're having, you know,
[01:11:49] you're just trying everything you do to stick with it.
[01:11:54] But that was my first mission.
[01:11:57] Later on, I've finally realized that I didn't have an extra deering on my webgare to strap
[01:12:06] in.
[01:12:07] I was falling over backwards.
[01:12:09] I did that twice.
[01:12:11] Then I finally found out from my good buddy here until I was doing it wrong.
[01:12:19] Because after my second mission, children said left, but he had not given me that information
[01:12:27] out of all of our training.
[01:12:29] Had not thought about it.
[01:12:31] He was extracted on another jumper.
[01:12:38] It's unbelievable.
[01:12:41] When I read these things, I just can't.
[01:12:44] It's just hard to even fathom the mayhem when you're talking about just all these B40 rockets,
[01:12:50] which is basically like an RPG.
[01:12:52] Exactly.
[01:12:53] An older RPG.
[01:12:57] It's crazy.
[01:12:59] So I'm back to the book with one final urgent poll that Turner was able to move himself
[01:13:03] upright in the Swiss seat as the king be continued to climb higher into the sky.
[01:13:07] Distancing itself from the fear of exploding B40 and AK-47 gunfire while gaining air
[01:13:12] speed.
[01:13:13] As the king be ascended, the heavily sweating, L'Ecturnal clung to the rope as another
[01:13:17] sensation overwhelmed his body, chattering teeth.
[01:13:22] Within a matter of minutes, the king be had climbed to an altitude of more than 5,000 feet
[01:13:26] with the air is thinner and much colder than on the jungle floor.
[01:13:30] So much colder that LaTernos body began shaking violently from the dipping temperatures
[01:13:35] as the king be continued to climb into the safety of higher altitude.
[01:13:39] In ordinary circumstances, few people would ever think about freezing to death over Southeast
[01:13:43] Asia, but for the men in CNC was just another hurdle they had to clear.
[01:13:48] As the king be headed east, the final looked down on the spots in the jungle that appeared
[01:13:51] to be good LZs thinking, why don't you lay in there?
[01:13:55] What ST Virginia's collective agony continued until the king be finally landed in South Vietnam.
[01:14:00] By that time, every member of ST Virginia had their circulation cut off to their legs.
[01:14:05] They couldn't stand or walk.
[01:14:07] All they could do is unhook from their Swiss seat, grab their stuff, and try and get the circulation
[01:14:11] going again in their legs while the door gunner helped them to get back to the king be.
[01:14:17] When the team returned to Quang Tree, Quang Tree.
[01:14:22] The launch site before heading south to Foo Bay, children's pulled the Ternos side and told
[01:14:27] them, take good care of that radio.
[01:14:29] You're going to take it on the next mission, whether you like it or not.
[01:14:32] We're going to make you bring this shot up radio?
[01:14:34] Yeah, we did.
[01:14:36] We did.
[01:14:37] It saved his life till it's life in the end.
[01:14:40] How's that?
[01:14:41] That Christmas day mission?
[01:14:42] Okay, we had the Intel Report.
[01:14:44] Was that the same radio?
[01:14:45] You brought a shot up radio in the field?
[01:14:47] He did.
[01:14:48] Not me.
[01:14:49] I got a hundred miles skip out of it.
[01:14:53] That's ridiculous.
[01:14:57] As darkness fell, the king be lifted off from Quang Tree for Foo Bay.
[01:15:02] When the old warboards landed on FoB1 landing zone, S.T. Virginia was greeted by one man,
[01:15:09] former S.T. Virginia, 10 John McGovern.
[01:15:13] He greeted each of the team members as they exited the kingbees, asking each one, are
[01:15:17] you okay?
[01:15:18] After the kingbees departed, bathing them in sand, dust, and LZ debris kicked up by the prop
[01:15:25] wash, McGovern asked children, did you hear about beta?
[01:15:29] A tall.
[01:15:30] Children's Shirk has had no what happened.
[01:15:33] November 13th, we lost a kingbee with seven SF troops on it.
[01:15:37] We lost the entire kingbee crew.
[01:15:39] They were a bunch of strap hangers who volunteered to pull an elder son mission on the trail,
[01:15:44] but an anti-aircraft round hit the kingbee and route to the target.
[01:15:48] They exploded in midair, they never had a chance.
[01:15:52] In silence, McGovern drove the tired dirty and hungry team back to the team room.
[01:15:57] As the Viet to Meese team members climbed off the truck, McGovern turned to L'Aternal
[01:16:00] and said, you know what was really scary about that mission?
[01:16:04] The day before they got shot down, me, limb black, Rick Howard, John Peters, Tim Schaff,
[01:16:09] and a few others had volunteered and were actually on the kingbees suited up ready to go,
[01:16:15] only to be canceled last minute by Bad Whiskey Xray, which is a weather in the AO that was
[01:16:21] too close for comfort.
[01:16:23] After a long pause, pause, he asked the Terno, how did it go out there?
[01:16:27] I heard you were good on the radio, you didn't get rattled, you ain't a cheery no more,
[01:16:32] you've joined a small unique club of SF men, CNC recon men who went across the fence.
[01:16:39] It was nothing like I ever could have imagined the Terno responded, looking toward the
[01:16:44] Viet to Meese team members he added, let me get some child for the endage, you will
[01:16:48] write about them, they have ice in their veins, I'm beat, I'll see you in the morning.
[01:16:54] L'Aternal walked through the white sand to the mess hall, picked up some fresh sandwiches
[01:16:58] and cold sodas for the team.
[01:17:00] After lingering with the Viet to Meese team members, L'Aternal returned to his room, finally
[01:17:04] taking off his rucksack and web gear.
[01:17:06] As he started to undress, L'Aternal became aware of pain and his back, where from where
[01:17:12] the 4 AK-47 rounds had slammed him face first into the ground, first he peeled off his jungle
[01:17:17] fatigue shirt and was amazed to find four bullet holes in it.
[01:17:21] Then he took off his undershirt, dido, four bullet holes run it.
[01:17:25] L'Aternal picked up his rucksack, four bullet holes run it, both in the front and the back.
[01:17:31] Something he hadn't realized during the firefight, then he looked in the mirror and saw
[01:17:35] four large welts and broken skin up his spine where the AK-47 rounds had hit his body
[01:17:41] after punching through his rucksack and the PRC-25.
[01:17:45] Only then dido, L'Aternal began to comprehend just how lucky he had been hours earlier
[01:17:50] in the day when the NVA shot him in the back four times.
[01:17:55] L'Aternal began to cut away the black electrical tape around his socks which he pulled
[01:18:00] up over his pant legs to keep about leeches and bugs.
[01:18:03] Then he made a startling discovery.
[01:18:05] When he pulled his pant leg from the sock and pulled off his right boot, four AK-47 bullets
[01:18:10] fell on the ground.
[01:18:12] In the heat of the battle, the Frenchman didn't realize that after he was shot in the
[01:18:16] back the four 7.62 millimeter NVA rounds had fallen through his pants and his socks into
[01:18:25] his right boot.
[01:18:26] He stood in utter amazement staring at the four rounds on the floor before picking them
[01:18:30] up and throwing them in the sand outside his room.
[01:18:34] Exhausted, L'Aternal walked over to the shower room, the water stung, the wounds in his
[01:18:39] back, amazingly the four bullets had enough energy to penetrate his skin, wounding him, but
[01:18:45] not enough to get under his skin.
[01:18:48] Two tired to treat the four bullet wounds in his back and trap the wounds in his arm.
[01:18:52] L'Aternal finished his shower and went to bed.
[01:19:00] So that was mission number one.
[01:19:05] There's a saying that we came to realize later on that everybody just looked at you and
[01:19:14] say, well that's just another day and so on.
[01:19:19] My first mission, I had to run 12 more before it was done.
[01:19:25] And when you got done with it, I mean, you talked to the other guys and they were telling
[01:19:29] you, hey, yeah, that's how it is.
[01:19:31] Yes, that's how it is. He couldn't go into the bar and go, yeah, this is what I did.
[01:19:37] He just said, yeah, I got back.
[01:19:40] Well, and don't forget the footnote on that.
[01:19:42] Could like about what four or five days later, the medics?
[01:19:46] Yeah, tongue-butt the wounds from the strapple.
[01:19:49] Of course, I had to ignore everything because otherwise they don't think I was, you know,
[01:19:56] just a wipper.
[01:19:58] So I just had to suck it up, not saying nothing.
[01:20:04] But all of a sudden, I started getting these boils on me.
[01:20:08] They were huge.
[01:20:09] So I went to the medic and what's his name again?
[01:20:15] Magio, the medio says, well, you got strapple in your body.
[01:20:21] That's all, that's all swollen.
[01:20:23] It's infecting you.
[01:20:24] He says, you're going to have that for quite a while to wait and get every piece out of you.
[01:20:28] He says, I don't know how many holes you got, but this one here needs attention right now
[01:20:32] and it's huge.
[01:20:34] And it was my arm and forearm, actually.
[01:20:38] And he looked at the other medic, shipping and said, holding down and he looked at me and
[01:20:45] said, don't you look at what I'm doing?
[01:20:48] Don't you turn your head?
[01:20:50] He said, because otherwise you're going to pass out on me.
[01:20:52] When you see what I'm going to do, he said, so don't you look?
[01:20:56] And you're going to hold the management.
[01:20:58] You hold them down and don't look or you're going to pass out.
[01:21:01] Well, what he was doing was taking a big stick swab in hydrogen peroxide and burning a
[01:21:07] hole right through the boil and then he took four steps and he pulled the strings out
[01:21:13] with the shrattin' along the end from the B40 rockets because they're all made in China.
[01:21:17] They're chycombs, you know?
[01:21:20] And so they had a lot of string, that's how they wrapped them.
[01:21:23] They didn't mold them in the metal like we did.
[01:21:26] And so anyway, I kept having to go.
[01:21:29] And then another day I had to go any, I'd do the back of my head and I had a couple of
[01:21:34] my head and then I had a couple of my back and another under my arm and I walked around
[01:21:39] with bandages until I went out of my next mission.
[01:21:41] I got to tell you, I witnessed one of those get pulled out and it was gross.
[01:21:48] What were you doing, just wanted to get, you know, stuck?
[01:21:50] He had pulled several hours.
[01:21:51] We kept hearing about these things.
[01:21:52] Let me show you.
[01:21:53] Oh, thanks.
[01:21:54] Talk about TMI.
[01:21:55] Talk about pus.
[01:21:56] You're gonna go back in the field anyways.
[01:22:02] Yeah.
[01:22:03] It was like, hey, it doesn't matter.
[01:22:04] We'll do what we can right now.
[01:22:06] Yeah.
[01:22:07] Exactly.
[01:22:08] Exactly.
[01:22:09] Because we had another mission lined out for Christmas of 68.
[01:22:13] So what was the optempo like meeting how often would you, when you did you did your
[01:22:18] 13 missions, how long did that take?
[01:22:21] What time span was that over when the one year or two?
[01:22:23] One year tour.
[01:22:24] I had 13 missions and one bright light.
[01:22:28] And someday we'll talk about the bright light, I guess.
[01:22:32] Why not today?
[01:22:33] Well, that is a, it's not written in the books because of what it ended up being.
[01:22:43] But a bright light in the song is a volunteer situation where a team of volunteers to go
[01:22:49] in and get another team out that can't get out.
[01:22:53] And we had a lot of those or to try to find a team that disappeared.
[01:22:57] We had a lot of teams disappear.
[01:22:59] I, our TI-to-ho, Lane and Owens completely disappeared.
[01:23:02] They've never been found to this day.
[01:23:04] No trace.
[01:23:06] Just completely off the bat.
[01:23:08] People have gone into this day and hunt.
[01:23:10] The government hunts today and can't find them.
[01:23:13] And they're under good circumstances.
[01:23:15] Are these the guys that you took over for?
[01:23:17] Yes.
[01:23:18] Yes.
[01:23:19] And so when I got on the Idahoans transferred from Virginia to Idaho because
[01:23:25] till it went home and I became Lynne Blacks-1-1.
[01:23:31] One day he had been gone for a while up at headquarters and I always protected him because
[01:23:36] I'm the one one.
[01:23:37] I protected my one zeros.
[01:23:40] I had to know where they were doing all the time because you just never knew because we had
[01:23:46] we had nung's, we had cambo's, we had mountain yards, we had Vietnamese in our camp.
[01:23:53] They all fought amongst themselves.
[01:23:55] They're alone wondering if they're the enemy.
[01:23:58] And we also had an entire team of NVA, two hoys, two hoys being they gave up.
[01:24:05] And that was Team Cobra and they were there for a very special mission that they went
[01:24:10] on and to get US prisoners out of a camp that was located.
[01:24:17] But we got a call, Lynne went up to their headquarters and had been a little while.
[01:24:23] So I went up there to see what was going on.
[01:24:24] He's walking back down and says, can we go on a bright light?
[01:24:30] I said, we're ready, we're packed.
[01:24:33] Because that's just what you did.
[01:24:34] You were asked, you went.
[01:24:35] He said, we got two pilots down and we think they're alive.
[01:24:43] We got to go in.
[01:24:45] They brought a jolly green giant in for us, which is very unusual air force.
[01:24:51] I don't know where they really took us.
[01:24:54] At this point in time in my life, we still don't know.
[01:24:59] They have all kinds of records, but it's very confusing of where we went.
[01:25:03] The week came in and that jolly, when we circled over the top of the plane, it was all
[01:25:10] intact.
[01:25:11] It was just sitting there in elephant grass.
[01:25:15] No one could figure out why.
[01:25:18] So they brought us down and I jumped out.
[01:25:22] But when I jumped out, there was a slight lift in the plane and the jolly green and it just
[01:25:31] came down, back down on me, about crushed me and then it came back up and then ling jumped
[01:25:36] out and my guys jumped out.
[01:25:38] In each of it, it was an old two.
[01:25:40] It was a push pull, seshna, engine in the front and engine in the back.
[01:25:44] That's where it had been shot down.
[01:25:46] We think it was shot down.
[01:25:47] We don't.
[01:25:48] Or crashed, how ever?
[01:25:49] We just don't know how it happened.
[01:25:51] But what the real deal was is the plane, whatever happened to it was making an emergency
[01:25:59] landing and it saw this opening like an LZ and thought this would be a good place to at
[01:26:06] least start the landing even if it went into the jungle.
[01:26:10] It would slow it down.
[01:26:12] Problem was, as soon as they hit the ground, there was a bowl and they hit the front of
[01:26:17] the bowl with the front engine and stopped dead.
[01:26:20] Like a bird?
[01:26:21] It was a bird.
[01:26:23] It stopped dead but it bent the engine around to the right and the right seat was sucked
[01:26:30] up into the carburetors into the Lycoe engine and he was in the fins and he just had his
[01:26:37] head and his arms sticking out.
[01:26:39] When I got there on that side, it said 10 minutes after 10 in the morning.
[01:26:45] His Rolex watch was cracked.
[01:26:47] The bezel was cracked and it stopped the watch at 10 after 10.
[01:26:51] And we didn't get there till about 230.
[01:26:55] And don't forget when the chopper's going down, you're out of fire.
[01:26:58] Yeah, and we're getting some small arms fire.
[01:27:02] And Lin goes to the pilot side on the left side and he looked fine but we realized the
[01:27:10] Yoke had crushed his chest and killed him in place but it also had him trapped and we
[01:27:15] couldn't get either one out.
[01:27:18] But at that point in time, that was a trap.
[01:27:21] They had set the Johnny Green back off and we started taking tremendous amount of fire.
[01:27:31] And I looked across the inside of the cabin at Lin and then looked back at me and I said
[01:27:37] I love your brother or not getting out of this and he said no we're not.
[01:27:43] This is it.
[01:27:44] And I looked up and radioed the Jolly Green to come back in and he shook his head.
[01:27:54] I could see him playing his day.
[01:27:56] He shook his head.
[01:27:57] I don't think I can come back.
[01:27:59] I said you better because I got an M79 point in it at you.
[01:28:04] I'll take you down with us.
[01:28:06] He moved up forward.
[01:28:09] By that time there was 200 NBA surrounding us.
[01:28:12] We're giving it everything they got and we managed crawling into that chopper because
[01:28:17] if we got up on the wings and he scooped us up and I had already called in tech here because
[01:28:24] they already had tech here ready.
[01:28:26] And as we lifted off and got up about 50 feet and A1 sped flew right underneath us between
[01:28:35] the plane and the chopper.
[01:28:39] Like he looked up at me like this and was smiling and he dropped the WP right on top of
[01:28:46] them and there was crispy critters running everywhere and we got out of there and got back
[01:28:55] and we walked down landed us back at FB4 and we walked down the road back to our hooch
[01:29:05] and we just looked at each other and said another day and so on.
[01:29:10] And all the time they were on the ground.
[01:29:11] They were under fire going in.
[01:29:14] They put a perimeter around the aircraft while Lynn and Doug went in to try to establish
[01:29:19] what the status of the pilots wore and the firefight was intense.
[01:29:25] I remember when I got back, Doug had just left and I came back to know at the end of October
[01:29:31] 69 that I bright laid was fresh on Lynn's mind and we talked about it and I talked
[01:29:37] to him later about that bright laid and he was crazy because he had salty went and
[01:29:43] went forward and did from RT Idaho and that team and Lynn was like, man, I don't even
[01:29:49] know how we got out of there.
[01:29:51] So I was one of those real, just a really tight one but like Doug says in a way when you
[01:29:56] know, and retrospect like, I just another day in the sag but that wouldn't really stuck.
[01:30:03] Yeah, I just thought that out of all my missions and if you read the book and were tilt
[01:30:12] honors me with a few missions in his books between across the fence and on the ground,
[01:30:19] that when there was, as his tenses had gotten, we thought it was over physically and mentally,
[01:30:25] we gave up, we thought it was over.
[01:30:28] That we weren't going to get up out of that mess and get into that chopper.
[01:30:31] Then before he rockets were hitting that plate underneath that jolly green, we were going
[01:30:36] up in the air faster than the chopper could get us up in the air from the pounding we
[01:30:40] were taking.
[01:30:41] They had been for that spad, we might not have.
[01:30:44] To this day we can't find the spad pilot.
[01:30:47] We have reunions we go to, the spad and reunions but we still can't be able to find that
[01:30:51] spad pilot that did that day.
[01:30:53] Because what he says is like when the jolly green is pulling out the beef 40 pounded underneath
[01:30:57] and the armor playing could sustain it.
[01:31:00] But it would give the chopper a jolt like Liv Blackhead on October 5th and this would
[01:31:04] they were experiencing again one October, year later, same thing.
[01:31:09] Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:10] I'm surprised that they take those beef 40 strikes like that.
[01:31:15] I mean, one lucky shot that hits the tail rotor or something and it's just game over.
[01:31:20] Sure.
[01:31:21] When we get back on missions we would walk around our Kingbees and count how many bullet
[01:31:25] holes and how many were in the blades.
[01:31:29] We could there's clean shots through the blades and then we we'd caught 40, 50, 80 rounds
[01:31:35] in our Kingbees when we come back and pieces of metal gone that they had to put tin over.
[01:31:43] They used beer cans.
[01:31:44] Yeah.
[01:31:45] A loona beer cans.
[01:31:46] Yeah.
[01:31:47] And what about the, what about that operation where you, we had to go and get the 55 gallon
[01:31:56] drum of and pull that one over?
[01:32:00] Yeah.
[01:32:01] Okay.
[01:32:02] We'll go through that.
[01:32:05] Somebody would probably like to read it in the book but we'll kind of go through that.
[01:32:09] We were trained.
[01:32:11] We had a CIA agent come in and trainers.
[01:32:15] For a brand new explosive detonator that was a time device that was shaped on the top
[01:32:22] in of a bung of a 55 gallon drum.
[01:32:27] As curls you put a wrench on it and unscrew it.
[01:32:31] You've seen them.
[01:32:34] And we said, this is by way.
[01:32:35] This is a seal type mission so you really appreciate this.
[01:32:37] So this is absolutely yeah.
[01:32:39] When I read about it, it's, I was like, hmm.
[01:32:41] It's a good seal mission.
[01:32:43] But a well.
[01:32:45] Well, they didn't let the seals do that in those days.
[01:32:49] No, they're busy on the coast.
[01:32:52] Yeah, they're busy on the coast.
[01:32:53] They really were.
[01:32:54] We, I mean, everything up to that is in a jungle.
[01:32:57] I'll see you get to the riverboat.
[01:32:58] Exactly.
[01:32:59] But we actually went into secret lockup, couldn't talk to anybody.
[01:33:07] Nobody could come in and talk to us and we went through these exercises and training.
[01:33:12] We actually loaded up for it and they took us out to the, and took us to a concrete
[01:33:22] and we launched out of there and went into layoffs into this huge river that they had.
[01:33:28] But we had to stay away from it.
[01:33:30] We had to actually hike in for two days to get to it.
[01:33:35] And when we got there and down the hill and to the river, it was night on the second
[01:33:42] end of the second day.
[01:33:44] And then Gunther was my one zero and I was as one one.
[01:33:49] There was no one one two.
[01:33:51] And he was an X Marine.
[01:33:56] And he was an E6.
[01:33:58] And he was my one zero.
[01:34:00] He'd been around a while.
[01:34:02] And he says, okay, go in and get that drum.
[01:34:06] And I said, well, you're the Marine.
[01:34:08] You're Navy.
[01:34:09] Why should I go in again?
[01:34:11] I'm just going to do the one.
[01:34:14] You're the one one.
[01:34:16] You're a PFC.
[01:34:18] And I'm an E6.
[01:34:20] So that's how it's going down.
[01:34:21] And don't forget before you get there, they hike through jungle for two days and two nights.
[01:34:28] To meet the CIA.
[01:34:29] I forgot that.
[01:34:31] Who gave them specialized charters.
[01:34:34] He come from.
[01:34:36] He had Chinese with him.
[01:34:39] And he said, I will meet you out there to give you this device because I can't trust anybody
[01:34:44] to have this device in case you're caught between now and then.
[01:34:48] And I said, there's no way we're going to find you out there.
[01:34:51] This impossible.
[01:34:53] He says, don't you worry about it.
[01:34:55] You get to this coordinate.
[01:34:56] And I will find you.
[01:34:59] That's impressive.
[01:35:00] And he did.
[01:35:01] We got to that coordinate.
[01:35:02] We waited.
[01:35:03] And we waited.
[01:35:04] And next thing we know, he come right out of the jungle.
[01:35:06] And there he was.
[01:35:08] We were going to kill him with our ZNBA.
[01:35:10] Yeah, of course.
[01:35:11] Chinese with him.
[01:35:12] Oh.
[01:35:13] So Zola Nockless was his name.
[01:35:17] If you're a pronounce it right, I probably can't pronounce it right.
[01:35:21] Commerce spelling.
[01:35:22] It was.
[01:35:25] He actually was a renegade CIA agent.
[01:35:28] He was a desktoyaki that wanted to prove that he could be an infield agent as the story
[01:35:35] finally went that we didn't learn about this until what about 12 years ago.
[01:35:40] Yeah.
[01:35:41] And we did you meet him later?
[01:35:44] No, no, no.
[01:35:45] No, no.
[01:35:46] We don't want to know where he went.
[01:35:47] What happened to him?
[01:35:48] We met another CIA guy.
[01:35:50] We needed that was actually a counterpart to a Russian KGB agent that when they
[01:35:59] were in the Russian, finally admitted and declassified the Vietnam War.
[01:36:05] And admitted they had 3,000 Russians helping the NVA.
[01:36:11] And they had a reunion.
[01:36:13] And they did an actual video of the reunion admitting that they had worked with the NVA
[01:36:19] and the Chinese in helping the NVA go up and down the whole chain of betrayal.
[01:36:27] Well, this Zolunakus had figured this out and got a halt of this device.
[01:36:36] And how we learned about it was this CIA agent had gone there and helped declassify
[01:36:46] all the records of special ops stuff that was they were they had located.
[01:36:53] They hold here they found my name in the KGB at Files in Moscow twice, my code name
[01:37:00] and my real name and the missions that I ran.
[01:37:06] They did that twice and they found Lin because we bumped into what we thought was a Mexican,
[01:37:15] Spanish speaking person, speaking broken English and I'm from California, right?
[01:37:20] And I go back to my old days and I told Lin I said this guy's Mexican got to be.
[01:37:29] What the hell's he doing out here?
[01:37:31] And he's talking to us on the radio.
[01:37:33] He's got our frequency and Lin says, give me that phone.
[01:37:37] So he goes back and forth with him and he says, you got to move out of the area.
[01:37:42] He says, I'm not going to move out of the area.
[01:37:44] I'm here to stay.
[01:37:45] Here's my coordinate.
[01:37:46] He said, get in a five digit coordinate.
[01:37:47] But no, what do you get to do? He says, well, not there, but you need to move out of
[01:37:51] the right.
[01:37:52] He was trying to save our butts because he was from Angola.
[01:37:55] He was a Cuban, stationed in Angola and had been shipped to Los Leos and then turned
[01:38:01] around and he hated the Vietnamese so much.
[01:38:04] He was trying to help us.
[01:38:07] But we could see him on the other side of the river that where we were at on this particular
[01:38:11] mission.
[01:38:13] And so that mission was in the KGB files that we had spoke to him and he had art and
[01:38:18] they knew it was RTI to go and that knew it was Lin and me.
[01:38:22] And so they had as much because we had spies and sigh on giving all this information out.
[01:38:28] We had to spy that they finally caught an American.
[01:38:33] It was giving all this information out.
[01:38:35] But for two missions, I'm in the KGB files.
[01:38:38] So on this oil drum mission, we get down there after we've been given the device
[01:38:44] at night and I go in and I grab a hold of a drum and of course they have those little
[01:38:51] lips on there.
[01:38:52] I can pull that drum and they're full of about three quarters because they got to
[01:38:56] be buoyant.
[01:38:58] And I bring that fuel drum right to the side and I'm holding it there and dunk
[01:39:05] there, unscrews it, the bug off and puts the new one in, screws it up tight.
[01:39:11] Now I've got to get that drum back out into the flow.
[01:39:15] While the flow is NVA walking it down with bamboo poles pushing them around.
[01:39:23] So I get it out there but I can't get back because here they come.
[01:39:28] So I had to go under and hold my breath but I can't hold my breath that long.
[01:39:32] This water is ice cold right?
[01:39:35] But fortunately I was a great swimmer in my youth and I could handle this but I could
[01:39:43] get my nose just above the surface blow out and take a breath and go back under.
[01:39:50] But because it's dark and they went on by me, finally, but I thought for sure they'd
[01:39:56] stick me with one of the poles but they pushed that drum on down and the few drums
[01:40:01] that were around me and I came back to the edge and crawled out but I was so cold I could
[01:40:07] hardly move.
[01:40:08] I'm so open wet of course and Gunther says come on we got to go and I finally put my gear
[01:40:16] back on my rutsack and the radio and my web gear and everything else back on and up the
[01:40:21] hill we go but I'm still just barely making it just barely making it I'm so stiff.
[01:40:27] Now we crawled out of there took two days to get out but that device was set for two
[01:40:32] days but they hadn't gone off yet but we finally got extraction orders and they came and
[01:40:39] got us and strung us out and when we were on strings it went off and the cubby writer
[01:40:44] was there and it was like an atom bomb it was a miniature mushroom and the shockwave even
[01:40:53] though we were miles away came through us on strings and the choppers and just like this
[01:41:00] and we're going like this back and forth and the cubby plane is shaking like this and
[01:41:10] I mean it was like an atomic bomb just went through us what you picture when you see and
[01:41:15] then everything became calm and mission completed.
[01:41:20] That's a good one. That's a real good one.
[01:41:25] And they never knew. Never knew. Well they didn't know until the Russians knew. Yeah
[01:41:29] other than that. They never knew who and we weren't allowed to talk or tell anybody in
[01:41:33] camp when we got back. They just what were you doing? I just another day in song and that
[01:41:39] was what we said because we weren't even allowed to tell anybody what we did because of
[01:41:44] the CIA mission that we ran but everybody had certain things that they did like that.
[01:41:51] But it was the first time it had ever been accomplished.
[01:41:54] What did you notice about the one zeros that you had from a leadership perspective that
[01:42:01] you remember as like yeah this is the quality some of the qualities that they had from
[01:42:06] a leadership perspective that you would follow.
[01:42:11] I was most fortunate I think I had great one zeros some of them not as great as others
[01:42:20] but when you my first one he was my idol because my first two missions and thanksgiving
[01:42:33] of 68 and Christmas of 68 and you can't ever forget those you know. So the mission
[01:42:44] of 68 is where I got the skip from the blow-up radio that let him know he was walking
[01:42:51] into an act letting tilting know that he was walking into an ambush and I'm laying on a trail
[01:43:00] with the radio on and heard this my interpreter comes up and interprets what's going on.
[01:43:07] I managed to get a whole to spider parks he just happened to be going by for a radio
[01:43:11] check and I told him what's going on he radios to to tilt to turn around and go back
[01:43:16] that he had intel and tilt's going what yeah as the first time I ever had like a direct
[01:43:23] intel report do not go to the northeast this is the Christmas day mission we were on top
[01:43:27] of that no and midnight talked about that was the one quiet area probably there's a problem
[01:43:34] but we're talking about it spider goes do not go to the northeast we have an intel report
[01:43:39] do not go there I'm going to like intel report that never happened before or after on a
[01:43:44] live mission we're on the ground and we didn't know what to help us but they were right
[01:43:51] we didn't you know the story we could extract is we're back in base a few days later
[01:43:55] him and public connect and it's going like well well you want to ground a Christmas
[01:44:00] and we found out that he had that intel report that was confirmed the one place we could
[01:44:07] have gone we shouldn't have our instincts are right but we had a confirmation from
[01:44:10] the intel report and it was just amazing you know it's just like to this day they got
[01:44:18] out of it and due to other factors they got out of it but just that it saved the team was
[01:44:24] walking into an L shape ambush that they've been slaughtered and they were pushing them
[01:44:29] that way with trackers gunfire and everything else and so they just just like you say
[01:44:36] the gods were always with us sometimes but at that very next day I'm still on the trail
[01:44:44] where we were assigned that was the trail for my very first mission we got into North
[01:44:48] Vietnam into it called nickel steel and I'm been laying there for four days
[01:44:53] through this process and Gunther was I you know I mean Chotters was my one zero
[01:44:59] and we were taking turns and it had been defolated with Agent Orange and so we
[01:45:07] had a pretty good view and all of a sudden I saw six point men coming up MBA I'm
[01:45:18] up there at the trail behind a log they're down below I give him the signal I give
[01:45:24] him the signal I got six and I can see him and Chotters right away knows what's going
[01:45:29] on so he's preparing the team to fight and X-Fill out of the situation but he can't
[01:45:37] with me above but here comes one of the NVA it comes right up to the log and steps
[01:45:44] over and steps right on me I put my car 15 into his belly and I pull the
[01:45:49] trigger all 20 rounds made a gaping hole all the way through him through him over
[01:45:55] the log and I'm on the run and I've got the radio and down the hill we go
[01:46:03] and here comes 200 NVA and their point Jasonus and we're we're bringing I'm
[01:46:12] trying to get tacky around the line I finally do we're putting tacky
[01:46:16] here between them and us and I'm throwing smoke over my shoulder yeah
[01:46:20] anything anything in the smoke and finally they bring the some slicks in and
[01:46:27] pull us out and and get us out of there on strings yeah on strings again and
[01:46:34] on the run and so the side note to the whole mission is I don't know how many we
[01:46:42] killed but it was not a good day for them but that age in orange was the only
[01:46:48] time I was ever near it and right now I've got stage four cancer from age in
[01:46:53] orange with a limited amount of time left so that's why I'm glad I'm here to
[01:47:00] tell a few stories glad you're here too they're born the um so how many tours did
[01:47:09] you do was that one tour I signed up for what I volunteered to go in
[01:47:16] special forces when I was regular I mean I volunteered regular I mean went
[01:47:20] through got special forces volunteer Vietnam volunteer for CCN and Sagan and I
[01:47:27] did one tour and I went back home and became a weapons instructor for
[01:47:32] special forces training group and got out so how many years was the total three
[01:47:38] three years three years that was it and then what you do when you when you got
[01:47:44] out I kind of went back to rodeo and training horses and things like that and
[01:47:53] then I sort of got calm got your past license yeah I got my pilot's license
[01:48:03] fixed wing and rotary well you got home how long did it take to kind of adapt
[01:48:08] to the civilian life it took about a year that because I slept with my car
[01:48:14] 15 and then when I was in training group I always had all the weapons around me
[01:48:19] I felt safe but you know fourth of July it was always a hard one with stuff
[01:48:25] going on you don't know and it took me a while to to calm down and not because
[01:48:31] I had a lot of kills and you just have to work through all that all the time and
[01:48:38] I was pretty good because not after that period of time you know we'd never
[01:48:45] talked to each other we weren't allowed to talk about it for 20 years as
[01:48:49] what I was told so I never ever talked to anybody I never met anybody until
[01:48:55] 2000 did you guys I mean when you when you you guys didn't keep in touch you
[01:49:00] guys didn't write each other or tell tonight wrote each other but he his
[01:49:05] family moved I only had his mother and father's address and I lost contact
[01:49:10] for 25 years I moved he moved my parents moved and so the comma dropped but we were
[01:49:18] down there was no books no yeah no nobody could say anything what about other
[01:49:24] team members other guys was there anyone that you kept in touch with over the next
[01:49:27] 20 years no so when you were done you were done you were done you didn't you
[01:49:32] it was over yeah because I couldn't find anybody I didn't know anybody to talk to
[01:49:36] you so I was just done and I just let then my life just I never thought about
[01:49:41] it anymore you know I knew I did stuff but I couldn't talk about it and I had
[01:49:48] gotten married and I told my wife about it but we just thought that we didn't
[01:49:54] know anybody way I didn't know anybody went to and then all of a sudden the
[01:49:58] internet came about I typed in SF one time and a couple emails came up old
[01:50:05] ones I typed in and a mclusky got he was working as a metavac pilot and
[01:50:14] he called me and he see we was on shift and he saw it and he called me and
[01:50:18] gave me tilt's phone number I called tilt the next day was Easter Sunday what
[01:50:21] year was half 2000 yeah we're going to get ready to go to church I have I
[01:50:27] hadn't seen him since 1968 our 69 and where were you living at the time I
[01:50:32] lived up by you 70 National Park in the town called Mariposa beautiful and
[01:50:38] you were just down in ocean sign yeah working at the paper the fish rapper so I
[01:50:45] said well shoot you know I so I got the phone number and I called him on Easter
[01:50:52] Sunday he was going out the door to go to church and I said you better sit down
[01:50:57] this is the Frenchman I did and then we've been we talk every day though
[01:51:05] because we can what did you what did you do for a job so you you had to kind of
[01:51:10] continue to kind of get it out of your system where breaking horses or whatever
[01:51:15] rodeo for another year after you got out breaking more bones and then you
[01:51:20] went into construction business I went into construction business that my father
[01:51:24] had gone into a private construction for a particular person and so at left the
[01:51:31] license open so I just continued the license and he handed it over to me and I
[01:51:38] built for almost 45 years now retired now what where did you guys overlap was
[01:51:45] that did you guys overlap in RT Idaho is that when you guys overlap well we are at
[01:51:50] food by when he came in he came with Bubba okay and so my government got him
[01:51:55] first before I were talking to him and I got Bubba so we were in camp we're
[01:52:00] training together at the firing range then Bubba and I were doing our targets
[01:52:04] they're doing theirs and then when we moved he was that he closed out that will
[01:52:11] be one he's the last SF troop there his recon team closed it locked the gate
[01:52:15] by that time Lynn and I were down in the Nang already so we were running
[01:52:21] business he went down with with with RT Virginia with Guntherwald and so they
[01:52:27] went down and ran their business including the famous oil drum one and Lynn and
[01:52:32] I were doing our thing and then by April my time in country was getting close
[01:52:37] so Lynn had agreed to be to come to one zero we had a special mission we were
[01:52:42] supposed to go up to the Mughi up past we brought Doug in Max Forron and Barry
[01:52:47] and an officer to go with us on that mission we trained for the mission
[01:52:52] trained right up to it went to the launch site on the choppers took off and they
[01:52:58] called us back and because two aircraft were shot down over the target area
[01:53:01] that day and so I was about four or five days from D-Rosing we went back to
[01:53:08] the camp they prism up the marble mountain so we're up there we have some
[01:53:12] pictures from that time there and then I walked off the marble mountain
[01:53:17] back up my gear and went home so Doug stayed with Idaho so from April at
[01:53:23] the end of April all the way through Dr. over 69 he's with Idaho with Lynn and
[01:53:28] they ran a load of missions and I come back he had just left base but Lynn's
[01:53:34] there so the Lynn was the one zero so he and I took turns and then finally
[01:53:39] so our gym major goes as too much experience here black you're out of here and
[01:53:43] then I went back to being a one zero for another five months and then but at
[01:53:48] time he had come home but he's in training group so technically he got out of
[01:53:53] the army after I did like I got out in April you got out in June and July
[01:53:57] September first September first yeah and so I went my I went back to the
[01:54:02] Garden State and then he went back to California and separate ways and we did
[01:54:07] we had the cards and some notes I don't think my phone calls and it just
[01:54:12] let us back if we had a couple of guys I had other people I stayed in contact
[01:54:15] with and then I just figured he got a job with a CIA or just something
[01:54:20] somewhere else you know and then finally got the phone call on 2000 and the
[01:54:25] rest of his story and how often do you guys the link up now?
[01:54:29] Every day it's all in the phone it's like you and the Eccletrails now.
[01:54:35] We we talk almost every day and because we can we're alive and we try now
[01:54:43] to spread the story since we've been declassified like you're helping
[01:54:50] tremendously to spread this story to let people know that we actually
[01:54:55] there was a secret war going on and we were actually taking the war to the
[01:54:59] enemy because our country had signed a treaty saying that we would not go into
[01:55:04] North Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia or the DMZ which we operated in every day
[01:55:10] right we weren't stationed here we just flew in by helicopters people always ask
[01:55:16] me well how long did you fight in South Vietnam I said I never fought a day in
[01:55:20] South Vietnam they all you didn't do anything no that's true you're right
[01:55:26] it's what was your reaction as stuff started to kind of come to the surface and
[01:55:32] people started talking about it it was a slow it's been a slow process I've
[01:55:40] got a hold of tilt and then we saw each other for the very first time after
[01:55:44] all those years I was standing on a corner when I drove by and picked
[01:55:47] the most yeah and we went to an air show and we started talking we had our
[01:55:54] photo albums that we weren't supposed to have because no pictures were supposed
[01:55:59] to be taken look at all the pictures that are out good recon man always do
[01:56:04] whatever they want right so but it's been a slowy says well we have a reunion
[01:56:11] now I really we'd have it in Vegas every October now and it's been going on
[01:56:18] what 45 years they're 43 or 44 years worth I've been there about 18 years now
[01:56:25] it's best of operations association yeah and so we go there and see each
[01:56:30] other and sit around and drink and of course I don't drink but you know we
[01:56:36] everybody drinks and it's a free bar and and tell old war stories each other
[01:56:41] and just be a couple of lies and the stories get more exaggerated and but we
[01:56:46] have a we we have the up but problem is we're dying faster than then you
[01:56:52] can we we were losing about 10 or 12 tops six seven in the very beginning
[01:56:58] now we're losing over 50 a year there weren't that many of us to start with
[01:57:02] but this is a combined all the support troops actual recon troops there's
[01:57:08] probably not but 45 or 50 there at all because we only had what 450 reconers
[01:57:14] as you talk to yeah you know and so we have this great reunion every year
[01:57:22] and I just never miss it because I don't know who's gonna die just like yesterday
[01:57:27] was our interpreter perhaps two year anniversary of his death and most
[01:57:34] everybody's going down with age orange of some kind of cancer and stuff
[01:57:38] Elden Bardswell just went down from an accident he was our two star general
[01:57:45] very proud of him but at the time he was we were both
[01:57:49] Choco had time in the journey wasn't well I didn't I my boss worked
[01:57:53] directly from Charles I was under his command but my my boss at the time
[01:57:56] just you know just absolutely loved them and you know try to tell me try to
[01:58:01] give me quotes when he'd come back from a meeting with Bardswell he said
[01:58:04] bar old man said this no man said that you know he he was just at my house not too
[01:58:09] long before that and and my train room I've got trains Lionel and he was there
[01:58:18] had a great time but there were roommates for a few months okay we were on our
[01:58:22] and our together I met his first son when he was two months old
[01:58:26] yeah well right could you know remember story Elden getting shot in the chest
[01:58:30] yeah so two days later Elden and Doug went to Hawaii with their
[01:58:36] respective wives for R&R there were there for five days in the Elden met his
[01:58:42] son for the first time is Eldest son brand yeah brand was there so you guys
[01:58:47] must have watched him because he was you know a general in the army even he
[01:58:52] was in the limelight for sure for a military guy oh yeah and you guys knew
[01:58:56] the whole time you're looking at him thinking hey he was called
[01:58:59] Spess was fourth class yeah that's the way we knew I could never call him
[01:59:03] general I could never call him Bardswell I called him Elden and he was the
[01:59:12] same Elden that we met in 68 as the same Elden went to the reunion with
[01:59:17] last year he was there in his respect and glory and you know that's the way
[01:59:22] we respected him like my son got wounded and in Iraq he went and saw this
[01:59:28] care at the hospital picked up for him right away they couldn't believe a
[01:59:32] two-star general one can do something a little grunt yeah some those
[01:59:36] best he's a scout and he got banged up for the home of he really bad but the
[01:59:41] Elden what year was that August 20th 2005 a couple weeks later you were in
[01:59:47] country then no it's I didn't I was in there at 0304 and no six yeah where do you

[02:00:17] and the freshman will build a house for you
[02:00:21] and what about so you got you got married when you got done is that or along
[02:00:27] the way along the way yeah into javity kids I have a son and I have a daughter
[02:00:32] I got a grandson and two grand daughters very proud of him I'm really proud of
[02:00:38] my son he is his own company in the oil business doing really well he
[02:00:43] repairs all the big fracking machines okay yeah I'm right now I'm in Texas I
[02:00:49] wasn't Tennessee but I'm in Texas now now that I've found out what my medical
[02:00:53] health is I want to try to get my grandson to know me before I go well
[02:01:01] that's that's awesome he's gonna be as proud he's gonna be as proud of you
[02:01:05] as you are of him that's for damn sure well they made an action figure of me
[02:01:09] so I've left that action figure for him and that's the famous picture
[02:01:15] yes the famous sag the Frenchman yes I've seen it there's a good review of it on
[02:01:21] on YouTube I watch yeah you can go to YouTube and look up Frenchman action
[02:01:27] figure and it's done really well by Ryan Peters yeah he did a really excellent
[02:01:34] job even made the box and everything for yeah no it works it's pretty awesome
[02:01:40] well definitely I'll definitely post that that picture when when this goes up
[02:01:46] when this goes out onto the under the inner web says they say and you got
[02:01:50] your Frenchman challenge coin I got my Frenchman challenge coin yeah it's right
[02:01:54] here the lowest ranking challenge coming out makes the general's on beat
[02:02:00] there's a p of c challenge code it doesn't give much better than that
[02:02:07] for sure you got anything else I think it's a good place to be and if you
[02:02:15] listen to this and you think a more things you want to say but you know I think
[02:02:18] this is a good good spot to wrap up this one so if you got anything to tell
[02:02:22] you got anything else first no these stories you know it's funny because
[02:02:29] even we're in base we never knew a lot of the details and so when I put the
[02:02:34] books together talk to other people like the oil drums story we learned
[02:02:39] about 40 years later that Lynn Black had done the similar thing with RTI
[02:02:43] the how after I left right in between these guys and it's just like a lot of
[02:02:49] history that comes out slowly like Doug has said was anyone tracking was anyone
[02:02:55] right down the history as it was happening was anyone taking the operational
[02:02:59] summaries and compiling them somewhere they were all destroyed that was
[02:03:04] when I left food by one of my jobs was to go through and make sure that all
[02:03:09] the drums had been no the ashes they'd burnt all the a lot of reports after
[02:03:15] action reports were all burnt and then as we pulled out of every FOB and
[02:03:22] closed down CCN and CCS and CCC we closed all the everything was destroyed there's
[02:03:29] very few after action reports so with there are is just miniscule reports people
[02:03:35] try to put them out on eBay but they're fake they're just isn't any
[02:03:39] and there are out there we haven't there reports of archives that were even now
[02:03:44] beginning to look into but at a recent reunion the guy came up to me and said hey
[02:03:49] you know if you've done your books I got to like to talk to you because my job
[02:03:54] when we closed contone was to destroy all the records yeah a lot of valor yeah
[02:04:03] we that's that's why I didn't even receive my purple heart for that first
[02:04:09] mission until 11 11 11 11 really yeah had to go back to the paperwork on it
[02:04:15] and we had to take six years and a lot of people and a lot of affidavids and a
[02:04:22] lot of this and a lot of that and it took six years until Diane black my
[02:04:28] congresswoman called me one day I was coming back from Arlington from Barry
[02:04:35] and Guntherwald and and my Virginia team Donnie shoe and and Bill Brown
[02:04:43] William Brown and she calls me on the phone on I don't even know who she is

[02:05:25] seven of my saggers come to that and watch till came everybody flew there we
[02:05:32] were there for witness and even here we found one to many to had pulled
[02:05:38] that this just string up from the shrapnel as an eyewitness that's that was a
[02:05:43] key thing we got the CEO to do a letter but took a while to track it down
[02:05:47] put it together but we did all the records have been destroyed you know so

[02:19:00] again just the deepest things I can give to John striker Meyer tilt and
[02:19:08] Doug Laterno the Frenchman for doing everything that they did to fight against
[02:19:17] the dark tyranny of communism as it tried to spread through the world they
[02:19:25] they held the line and it's incredible the operations that they did and it's
[02:19:33] incredible the sacrifices that those operators made in that time especially and
[02:19:40] obviously the ones that did not come home and to the rest of you that have
[02:19:50] served or you are serving thank you for keeping us safe from today's threats
[02:19:57] which are vast and equally evil it is you that keeps us secure and keeps our
[02:20:11] way of life secure and to our police and law enforcement to the firefighters
[02:20:15] out there to the paramedics EMTs dispatchers correctional officers boarder
[02:20:21] patrol secret service and all other first responders you are on call every day
[02:20:30] you are waiting when we need help you are there so thank you for keeping us safe
[02:20:39] and to everyone else out there remember what the Frenchman
[02:20:49] said after his kernel god done explaining the treacherous situation that they
[02:20:56] were set to go into when that kernel asks if anyone had any questions the
[02:21:02] Frenchman replied where do you need help where do you need help
[02:21:12] it's a simple question but it's a powerful one there's people around you that need
[02:21:19] help ask them what it is they need ask them where it is that they need help
[02:21:30] and then get up and lock and load your sawed off M79 or whatever tool it is
[02:21:36] that you need to unleash to give them the help that they need and until next time
[02:21:44] this is jaco out
