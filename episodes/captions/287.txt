[00:00:00] This is Jockel Pondcast number 287.
[00:00:02] Bethesios and me.
[00:00:05] Jockel willing.
[00:00:06] Good evening, Eco.
[00:00:07] Good evening.
[00:00:08] And joining us again is Dave Verk, good evening, Dave.
[00:00:11] Good evening.
[00:00:12] So listen, if you've been tracking, we have been talking about BH LaDale Hart.
[00:00:18] We've been talking about his strategy, the indirect approach.
[00:00:20] We've been covering his book, the strategy of indirect approach.
[00:00:23] Then we rolled into his book, which is just called strategy.
[00:00:27] This stuff is, it's just, it's so important to wrap your head around this stuff.
[00:00:37] It's a lot of it is counterintuitive when you hear it.
[00:00:41] It's counterintuitive when you hear it.
[00:00:44] It's sometimes even more counterintuitive when you try and do it.
[00:00:49] And if you understand it and you do it and you execute it, it is a game changer in
[00:00:57] the way you execute and it's also a game changer in the way you think.
[00:01:02] So if you haven't yet listened to 285 and 286, to learn a little bit about BH LaDale
[00:01:08] Hart, who is a veteran soldier, a British soldier, World War I, wounded multiple times,
[00:01:18] sent back from the front multiple times, sent back to the front multiple times, fought
[00:01:23] in the battle of a song.
[00:01:24] I mean, just almost as whole the Italian wiped out, gravely wounded with Gai, he was gasped.
[00:01:31] I mean, been to how I'm back quite literally.
[00:01:36] There's not too many people we can talk about, obviously, that fought in the battle of
[00:01:39] a song.
[00:01:41] On the last podcast, I was talking about the fact that he, you know, we throw the words
[00:01:46] battle tested around, like all this battle tested.
[00:01:49] How about battle tested in what's actually the worst battle ever?
[00:01:55] That's where he kind of started to think about the strategy and tactics that we're
[00:02:00] being used.
[00:02:01] This is what sort of when he talks about the indirect approach is the antithesis to what
[00:02:08] World War I was.
[00:02:10] So if you haven't yet, go back and listen to 285 and 286 and then join us right now with
[00:02:18] 287 Dave and the intro remarks.
[00:02:22] No, you were writing down there.
[00:02:24] Yeah, I was thinking about the last podcast that we did and just where he's coming from
[00:02:31] and I'm actually super stoked to get to these concluding, these, the end of this section
[00:02:36] or this, this trilogy.
[00:02:39] Because I was saying this last time I think this is all new.
[00:02:46] Like I get to hear this in real time and the sort of the chronology of your very first
[00:02:52] introduction from 285 was like, hey, a little bit of the background of heart, but I didn't
[00:02:56] really, I didn't really sink in as you were saying it of what you just said, like what
[00:03:02] he went through and you said it left a mark on him, but I did not, I did not appreciate
[00:03:10] the depth of that mark and what it compelled him to do to try to course correct this massive,
[00:03:21] this massive mistake that he had to endure in witness.
[00:03:24] So I have, I think I've been able to understand what he's been saying a lot better as you've
[00:03:31] been reading it thinking about where he came from.
[00:03:35] You know what I should have done is I should have gone, well first of all, I should
[00:03:39] have given a little bit more detail there, but I also should have gone back, there's so
[00:03:44] many references to be a Tula del Hart in so many manuals, it's ridiculous.
[00:03:50] And I should have pulled some of those up and said, oh, when we did this Marine Corps manual,
[00:03:54] when I did this Army manual, here's where this come from, here's the roots of this statement
[00:03:57] because they, they cite, they cite him.
[00:04:01] So I guess part of it is, there's some other podcast that I have in the hopper in my mind
[00:04:08] that I want to do that I really can't do without people understanding this idea of the strategy
[00:04:15] of the indirect approach.
[00:04:16] I just can't, I can't go forward.
[00:04:18] It's like I had to do this.
[00:04:20] So I will go back, I'm sure, and do some more historical context around his life and
[00:04:29] what he went through.
[00:04:32] But I also, man, I wanted to get this stuff out there.
[00:04:34] You know, it's like a prioritize next Q drill to be quite frank with you.
[00:04:38] I would, I wanted to get people to understand this and see how beneficial it can be for their
[00:04:46] thought process because it's been so beneficial for my, for the last 30 years of my life,
[00:04:53] maybe 20, 25 years of my life where I realized, wait a second.
[00:04:59] Going direct isn't always the best thing.
[00:05:00] In fact, the more I figured that out, the more I was like, oh, going direct is usually
[00:05:05] not the best thing.
[00:05:07] Quite often the indirect approach is correct.
[00:05:10] It's the correct thing in Jiu-Jitsu, it's the correct thing in battlefield, it's
[00:05:13] a correct thing as a leader, it's a correct thing interacting with other human beings.
[00:05:18] So that's kind of where we are, how we got here.
[00:05:22] You know, a lot, a lot, that's the weird thing about having a podcast and doing things via
[00:05:26] podcast is part of the benefit as of it is the immediacy of it.
[00:05:33] Like, there's not.
[00:05:35] You know, if you write a book, if I was to write a book about this stuff, it would take
[00:05:38] three years, now two years.
[00:05:40] Like if I just was gave up everything else in set, I'm going to write a book about this,
[00:05:43] it would take two years to do, to get it, to get it written, to get it published, to get
[00:05:47] it, ever started to get it written, edited, I go, there's so much lag time to do a podcast,
[00:05:53] it's like, cool, you know what, here's a book, I've had this book for a long time,
[00:05:57] I actually gave you my extra copy of this book.
[00:06:00] So, to put to be able to say, you know what, I want to get this done now is the time
[00:06:05] to boom, you can go and execute it.
[00:06:06] And what you sacrifice is you sacrifice some perfection, right?
[00:06:12] You sacrifice some perfection because head, I sat there and thought about the best way to do
[00:06:17] this, maybe I would say, you know what I need to, I need an entire episode about the
[00:06:21] battle of the song, I need an entire episode about what gassing does to you, I need to
[00:06:26] do an episode about his battalion with the Yorkshire Light Regiment, right, and talk about
[00:06:31] exactly who is in it.
[00:06:32] There's a whole bunch of different things I could have done and it's not, and that's
[00:06:36] there, that would have made this better.
[00:06:39] And that's one of the, one of the compromises that you make in moving forward and executing,
[00:06:44] like, you know what, I'm looking back now, hindsight 2020, cool, should have done that,
[00:06:49] didn't do it, we'll do it in the future.
[00:06:51] So, where it goes?
[00:06:53] Yeah, and even for me, as I, as I contemplate what I'm trying to say, you talk about, you
[00:06:59] sacrifice the perfection of your sacrifice, even the way I'm trying to say what I'm thinking
[00:07:03] is not exactly right, it's not how I would say it if I spent time to sit down with a
[00:07:07] pen and paper and write out what I'm thinking or what I'm thinking about or the references
[00:07:12] I'm making in my head, but to be able to sort of reflect in real time as you're reading this,
[00:07:19] as inaccurate or not as eloquent as I'd like it to be, it's a really cool exercise, as
[00:07:26] they listener of leadership to think about hearing what he's saying, contemplating the
[00:07:34] frame of reference he had and how it applies to our world, which is, you don't need
[00:07:42] to be in war ever one to recognize how absolutely directly affected you can be by thinking
[00:07:49] about what he's saying and applying it to your day-to-day life and how you interact with
[00:07:52] people, which is kind of crazy to think about it, but it's also true.
[00:07:58] And I guess if there's a problem with any of this, if there's a problem with any of the
[00:08:02] things that you're saying is that there's nothing sexy about the indirect approach,
[00:08:07] it doesn't like, it doesn't play well.
[00:08:10] Like, you're not, I'm going to get up and give a speech about the indirect approach.
[00:08:15] Men, we're going to subordinate our egos today.
[00:08:17] It doesn't, the language doesn't work. It doesn't give you that satisfaction that people
[00:08:24] want with cross-wits the entotal war.
[00:08:28] But what's crazy is how obvious it is to think about how it helps you achieve the ultimate
[00:08:35] objective, which is winning the war.
[00:08:38] And how much more satisfying that is than just winning a battle, or than losing the war.
[00:08:46] So for whatever it lacks in the excitement of the language of, we're going to destroy every
[00:08:53] single aspect of our enemy down to the ground.
[00:08:59] This actually is the tool that you need to be successful in anything.
[00:09:02] This is how you actually win.
[00:09:03] Is that you win?
[00:09:06] That's very counter-cultural.
[00:09:17] Like you said, it doesn't sell well.
[00:09:19] You can imagine selling well, Jackson standing up and saying, all right, guys, the enemy
[00:09:23] is half mile down there.
[00:09:25] We are going to take the fight to them and people get fired up as opposed to saying, hey,
[00:09:29] the enemy is right down there.
[00:09:30] And we're going to walk 14 miles right now to go and hit him for where he doesn't really
[00:09:35] expect it because we don't want to have to face his really, we don't want to have to face
[00:09:44] his strength.
[00:09:45] We're a little scared to do that.
[00:09:46] So we're going to walk around and kind of soccer punch him.
[00:09:49] You guys with me?
[00:09:50] Right?
[00:09:51] It's just like, it's really, as opposed to forward into the breach, right?
[00:09:57] No, not really.
[00:09:58] We're going to sneak around and soccer punch somebody who's with me.
[00:10:04] But it's how you win.
[00:10:07] So let's jump back into it.
[00:10:13] Further revision of theory and trying to revise any theory and readjust it for better balance.
[00:10:18] Oh, isn't that interesting?
[00:10:20] We're talking about balance because this is everything is a dichotomy.
[00:10:24] Again, I owe royalties to the LaDale Heart family.
[00:10:29] It is a help to have a background of study in the subject.
[00:10:33] As long as one is willing to modify one's conclusions.
[00:10:38] Not interesting.
[00:10:39] We have to actually be willing to modify our conclusions.
[00:10:43] Change our mind.
[00:10:47] I was.
[00:10:48] So far as I know, the first student of war after 1914 to 1918 to make a re-examination of the
[00:10:54] prevailing doctrines derived from cross-rits about the objective in war.
[00:10:59] We're calling it in question in number of articles in the military journals.
[00:11:04] I was dealt with it more fully in Paris or the future of war 1925.
[00:11:11] This little book began with a criticism of the way that the Orthodox aim, quote, the destruction
[00:11:16] of the enemy's main forces on the battlefield, and quote, had been pursued in World War
[00:11:21] One pointing out its indesisive and exhausting results.
[00:11:27] To your point earlier.
[00:11:28] Hey, we want to go and confront the enemy head on.
[00:11:31] Cool.
[00:11:32] We did that for three years, at four years, and we had not only, we had indesisive and exhausting
[00:11:39] results.
[00:11:40] We were exhausting.
[00:11:41] We didn't get anywhere.
[00:11:43] God, what a freaking sin.
[00:11:46] What a sin to expend all those lives and be exhausted from it and have no real decisive
[00:11:53] victory.
[00:11:56] Continuing.
[00:11:57] I want to argue that the advantages of the moral objective showing how armored forces
[00:12:03] might deliver decisive blow against the Achilles heel of the enemy army, which is the
[00:12:07] communication and command centers, which form its nerve system and two, how air forces
[00:12:12] besides cooperating in this strategic action might also strike with the decisive effect
[00:12:18] direct at a nation's nerve system, and that is its static civil centers of industry.
[00:12:25] So he's the first guy that said, hey, well, we did in World War One sucked and we shouldn't
[00:12:29] do it again.
[00:12:30] How about we use freaking tanks and aircraft to pierce the enemy and cut off their communication
[00:12:38] and ruin their industries?
[00:12:43] Continuing.
[00:12:44] The general staff prescribed the book for the study of the officers of the first experimental
[00:12:48] mechanized force when this was formed two years later.
[00:12:51] The air staff less surprisingly made still fuller use of it.
[00:12:55] There was then a lack of textbooks on air strategy and it fitted the developing trend
[00:13:02] of their views on the subject.
[00:13:04] The chief of staff, the chief of the air staff distributed copies to his fellow chiefs
[00:13:09] of staffs.
[00:13:12] What I have said now is thus a revision after prolonged reflection of what I wrote a
[00:13:17] quarter century ago and an avowl of error over part of the thesis.
[00:13:23] So he's taking ownership of something that he screwed up.
[00:13:27] It shows how in correcting the balance one is apt to tilt too far the other way.
[00:13:34] This is something I call classic team guy over correction.
[00:13:37] I would make a, I'd go and guys would be coming through my training.
[00:13:39] They'd make a mistake.
[00:13:40] Hey, you're micro managing.
[00:13:41] Also, they let people do whatever they want or the opposite.
[00:13:45] Using the balance it one is apt to tilt too far the other way.
[00:13:49] T.E. Lawrence observed in a letter he wrote me in 1928.
[00:13:53] His Lawrence of Arabia.
[00:13:54] This is a guy that found the error, revolt in the Sinai and Palestinian campaign in World
[00:14:00] War.
[00:14:01] One, I mean, this guy is a legendary.
[00:14:04] And Lawrence of Arabia says quote, the logical system of crosswitz is too complete.
[00:14:12] What an opening line.
[00:14:13] A logical system of crosswitz is too complete.
[00:14:17] It leads a stray his disciples, those of them at least, who would rather fight with their
[00:14:23] arms than with their legs.
[00:14:28] What a freaking statement to open up a letter.
[00:14:32] Rather fight with their arms and with their legs.
[00:14:35] What an epic statement.
[00:14:38] It's kind of a kind of a goes in with my discipline.
[00:14:44] He goes free to them fieldmen.
[00:14:45] He'll talk in about, you know, oh, you want to fight?
[00:14:48] You want to know self defense?
[00:14:49] Cool.
[00:14:50] You want to punch me?
[00:14:51] I want to run away.
[00:14:52] You want to kick me, cool.
[00:14:53] I'm going to run away.
[00:14:54] I'm going to fight with my legs, not with my arms.
[00:14:59] Continuing on, you at present are trying with very little help from those whose businesses
[00:15:04] they think upon their profession to put the balance straight after the orgy of the last
[00:15:09] war.
[00:15:11] When you succeed about 1945, these are like little jokes he's making because he's writing
[00:15:16] this in 1928.
[00:15:17] When you succeed about 1945, your sheep will pass your bounds of discretion and have
[00:15:24] to be shivied back to some later strategist, back and forward we go and quote.
[00:15:32] In 1925, I myself went too far and arguing the advantages of the air stroke at civil objectives.
[00:15:40] Though I did qualify this by emphasizing the importance of executing it in such a way
[00:15:44] as to inflict the least possible permanent injury for the enemy of today is the customer
[00:15:49] of the morrow and the ally of the future.
[00:15:55] Who would think that that's possible?
[00:15:57] Who would think that Germany would become our ally?
[00:15:59] Right?
[00:16:00] Who would think that the Japanese would rebuild them to a point of economic power where
[00:16:07] we're in total cooperation with totally?
[00:16:10] My belief then was that a decisive era tack would inflict less total damage in constitute
[00:16:16] less of a drain on the defeated countries recuperative power than a prolonged war of the
[00:16:22] existing type.
[00:16:23] In further study, I came to realize that an era tack on industrial centers was unlikely
[00:16:26] to have an immediate decisive effect and more likely to produce another prolonged war of
[00:16:32] a tritian in fresh form with perhaps less killing but more devastation than from 1918,
[00:16:37] 1918, 1914 to 1918.
[00:16:41] World war.
[00:16:43] But when one began to point this out, one soon found that the air staff was far less receptive
[00:16:49] to the revised conclusion than to the original conclusion.
[00:16:52] They continued to cherish faith in a speedy decision and when war experienced compelled them
[00:16:58] to relinquish it, they pinned their faith instead on industrial attrition as fervently
[00:17:03] as the general staff of the last word done to manpower attrition.
[00:17:10] We're not learning lessons.
[00:17:12] God.
[00:17:15] Elective egos at play just not learning lessons.
[00:17:25] A lot of this is why, like I said, I've said a couple of times now that this book and
[00:17:29] these strategy is a setup for me for another series of podcasts that I want to do and
[00:17:35] it's all going to come so become so clear.
[00:17:41] Nevertheless, a realization of the drawbacks and evils of taking the civil fabric as the
[00:17:46] objective does not mean the restoration of battle in the own sense of the objective.
[00:17:51] The drawbacks of that cause wouldn't cause witsy in formula where amply shown in World
[00:17:56] War 1.
[00:17:57] In contrast, World War 2 demonstrated the advantage of new potentialities of indirect or
[00:18:03] strategic action against a military objective, amply confirming what had been forecast
[00:18:09] in that respect.
[00:18:15] Is he saying, yeah, I told you so?
[00:18:16] Yes, he is.
[00:18:17] He's saying, I told you so.
[00:18:19] I told you that these things, I told you that this error that this mechanized fast moving
[00:18:25] elements could change the face of war, especially when coupled with air power.
[00:18:30] I told you so.
[00:18:34] Even in the past, such action had been effectively exploited by some of the great captains
[00:18:39] despite the limitations of their instruments, but now with the help of new instruments,
[00:18:43] the airplane, the tank, it proved still more decisive despite the increased strength of
[00:18:49] tactical resistance.
[00:18:51] The new mobility produced a flexibility in varying the direction of thrust and threat which
[00:18:57] disarmed such resistance.
[00:19:00] And that's what we talked about in the last podcast.
[00:19:03] France, Poland, the Balkans, just disarmed resistance.
[00:19:08] The time has come for a fresh revision of the doctrine of the objective or military aim
[00:19:14] and light of recent experience and present conditions.
[00:19:17] It is much to be desired that it should be undertaken on combined service basis to produce
[00:19:23] an agreed solution for there is a dangerous discordance of doctrines at presence.
[00:19:30] The outlines of a revised theory fitted to present conditions and knowledge have emerged.
[00:19:33] I hope in course of this discussion of the subject, the key idea is strategic operation
[00:19:42] rather than battle and old term that has outlived its suitability and utility.
[00:19:50] So get rid of this whole idea of battle.
[00:19:52] Battles may still occur, but should not be regarded as the aim itself to repeat an earlier
[00:19:59] conclusion that was strikingly vindicated in World War II.
[00:20:04] The true aim is not so much to seek battle as to seek a strategic situation, so advantageous
[00:20:11] that does not of itself produce the decision that if it does not of itself produce the
[00:20:16] decision, its continuation by a battle is sure to achieve this.
[00:20:21] That's what we're looking for.
[00:20:23] And have your opponent recognize that before the battle takes place.
[00:20:27] So, optimally, yes, optimally they go, you know what, we don't even have a chance.
[00:20:31] If they don't recognize it cool, you're in such a good position that it doesn't matter
[00:20:35] anyways in the battles over very quickly.
[00:20:37] Yeah.
[00:20:38] I mean, I'm writing things down.
[00:20:39] I mean, just the things inside what he just said.
[00:20:43] I've had just the first thing of the common about study is designed to modify conclusions.
[00:20:49] Not to validate your conclusion, like I'm going to go to research and I'm going to literally
[00:20:54] just overlook and bypass anything that doesn't align with what I already think I know.
[00:20:59] I'm just like, that's not convenient.
[00:21:01] So I'm going to skip that.
[00:21:02] So I'm going to find, I'm going to study so I can find information to reinforce what I already
[00:21:06] know.
[00:21:07] He's like, no, I'm doing the study to figure out what I thought that's actually wrong.
[00:21:11] To modify my conclusions, the inherent humility in that approach, I'm going to study
[00:21:19] to find out where I'm wrong.
[00:21:23] I'll hard that actually is to do.
[00:21:26] And then he used the airsap, this example, and of course, you know, the airsap is a thing
[00:21:29] that didn't even exist.
[00:21:30] And now it's this thing where the counter culture there, they're the opposing view of,
[00:21:34] hey, we need to look at these things differently.
[00:21:37] And then how quickly, how quickly they solidified around their new approach and became the
[00:21:45] inflexible rigid, we are going to stick to these conclusions.
[00:21:48] We're going to state of these, we are not going to change our viewpoint of this.
[00:21:53] And how quickly that process happens to.
[00:21:57] Human beings do not change.
[00:21:59] No.
[00:22:00] They really don't.
[00:22:01] And they really like to dig into whatever they got a hold of.
[00:22:04] What didn't got a hold of something they hang onto it totally.
[00:22:07] It's like trying to pry a little freaking kid, a three year old with a rattle.
[00:22:14] You know what I'm saying?
[00:22:15] They got that rattle.
[00:22:16] Go and try and take that away from them.
[00:22:18] Why is that?
[00:22:20] It's a human instinct to hang onto what you've got.
[00:22:23] And you see the general staff after 32 years of military service in 150 years of combined
[00:22:29] military service between these three four generals.
[00:22:33] And they have that new rattle that they got a hold of.
[00:22:37] And they won't let go of it.
[00:22:39] Yeah.
[00:22:40] And they're going to kick and scream.
[00:22:42] It's disturbing.
[00:22:44] It's crazy.
[00:22:45] And he said something to that that he's referenced.
[00:22:49] You've already said it.
[00:22:50] And this one kind of finally stuck is he's making the connection to leadership.
[00:22:55] He's not talking about Klaus Wood so much.
[00:22:58] He keeps saying about his students, his disciples.
[00:23:01] The influence he had on a generation of leaders.
[00:23:05] And the tragedy that was created by that based on Klaus Wood's influence over people.
[00:23:14] And he's made the illusion too like that really wasn't his intent.
[00:23:18] He definitely last podcast.
[00:23:19] He definitely pointed out that that was not his intent.
[00:23:22] Totally.
[00:23:23] But the power for better for worse the power of that leadership.
[00:23:28] And if you have disciples and you've said this over and over again.
[00:23:32] And again, I don't remember the exact quote, but the uneducated disciples are more dangerous
[00:23:40] than the enemy.
[00:23:42] And to just blindly follow the language or the words of the leader and just try to go implement
[00:23:50] them without truly understanding the context.
[00:23:53] And then the evolving application of that to the world that they're going to be in.
[00:23:58] It's, I put the front, from those two pages, just pointing out those things.
[00:24:02] How critical those things are.
[00:24:05] Can you fathom the freaking group think that's going on?
[00:24:10] Check it out.
[00:24:11] Not only is everyone on my side bought into this bullshit.
[00:24:18] So my entire freaking army of millions of people is all bought into this idea and your
[00:24:28] side and your millions of soldiers and leaders are all bought to the same idea.
[00:24:33] Imagine how crazy that is.
[00:24:35] Imagine how crazy it is that our group think is so strong that both opposing sides both
[00:24:41] are bought into the same group think at the peril of millions of soldiers.
[00:24:49] Like that's not to think how strong that group think is to think I'm looking at you and
[00:24:54] you're doing the exact same thing as me and I'm thinking well, we're just going to keep
[00:24:58] doing it and you're looking at me thinking we're going to keep doing it and neither one
[00:25:01] of us is able to say you know what this doesn't make any sense.
[00:25:03] Hey, are you looking at what our enemy is doing?
[00:25:06] This is, this seems kind of dumb.
[00:25:08] The power of the group think there, the power of, you know, we always talk about right,
[00:25:13] you got to detach and you got to take a more strategic view.
[00:25:17] These are the freaking generals on both sides at the same time.
[00:25:24] At the same time wrapped up in the identical group think when they are getting a daily
[00:25:30] dose of reality, the most stark reality that human beings have ever seen.
[00:25:38] They're getting slapped in the face with that on the daily basis and they never look
[00:25:46] around and say hey you know what, this is freaking stupid.
[00:25:49] What are we doing?
[00:25:51] This is the sickest group think, fathomable.
[00:25:56] It's crazy.
[00:26:00] So it's detach.
[00:26:02] It's detach but like detaching to the strategic levels, not enough.
[00:26:07] If you're surrounded, if you're completely surrounded, if you're in the virtual reality
[00:26:13] goggles on, no matter where you look, it's like you're in the game.
[00:26:17] You need to take those things off your head.
[00:26:20] Alright, this is the last chapter that we're going to cover in this book.
[00:26:29] It's called Grand Strategy.
[00:26:34] It's going to tie into a lot of things.
[00:26:36] This book is concerned with strategy rather than with Grand Strategy or war policy.
[00:26:39] To deal adequately with this wider subject would require not only a much larger volume
[00:26:45] but a separate volume.
[00:26:47] For while Grand Strategy should control strategy, it's principles often run counter to those
[00:26:53] which prevail in the field of strategy.
[00:26:58] For that very reason, however, it is desirable to include here some indication of the
[00:27:03] deeper conclusions to which a study of Grand Strategy leads.
[00:27:10] The object in war, so this is an interesting setup.
[00:27:14] The setup is, hey, what I've been talking about at this strategic level, we're actually
[00:27:20] actually going to have some principles that are countered to that when we go up one more
[00:27:24] level.
[00:27:25] So this is a very interesting setup.
[00:27:29] The object in war is to attain a better piece, even if only from your own point of view.
[00:27:35] Hence it is essential to conduct war with constant regard to the piece you desire.
[00:27:41] That would appear to be common sense.
[00:27:45] What are we trying to get done?
[00:27:48] How can we get it done?
[00:27:50] Not just to win right now, but how can we set ourselves up in the grand future so that we're
[00:27:56] doing what we want to, so in this situation we want to be in.
[00:27:58] This is the underlying cloud switch definition of war as a, quote, continuation of fallacy
[00:28:06] by other means and quote, the prolongation of that policy through the war into the subsequent
[00:28:12] priests must always be born in mind.
[00:28:15] So you always have to think about the future.
[00:28:18] You always have to think about the future.
[00:28:23] You have to think strategically over time.
[00:28:25] All at all times a state which expands its strength to the point of exhaustion bankrupts
[00:28:32] its own policy and future.
[00:28:35] Again, what's the ROI?
[00:28:37] What's the ROI and what we're doing?
[00:28:40] We are spending all of our capital to make something happen and we look up and cool.
[00:28:44] We made it happen, but we have no capital left.
[00:28:47] We can't pay our employees.
[00:28:48] We can't order anymore of our supplies.
[00:28:52] Good job.
[00:28:54] No, not a good job.
[00:28:56] If you concentrate exclusively on victory with no thought for the after effect, you may
[00:29:01] be too exhausted to profit by the peace while it is almost certain that the peace will
[00:29:07] be a bad one containing the germs of another war.
[00:29:11] This is a lesson supported by abundant experience.
[00:29:18] I brought up this quote again, one of the previous podcasts about, hey, cool, you want to
[00:29:22] now you're in charge of a wasteland.
[00:29:25] How about a leadership capital perspective?
[00:29:27] Cool.
[00:29:28] I got Dave to do what I told him to do and now he hates working here and he's not going
[00:29:32] to do a good job and he's putting his resume out there to everybody else.
[00:29:35] Good job.
[00:29:36] Cool, but I got him to do what I wanted to do.
[00:29:40] I won, but he's got the germs of another war.
[00:29:47] And by the way, go look at what happened between World War 1 and World War 2.
[00:29:50] Yeah.
[00:29:51] Exactly what it is.
[00:29:52] It's referring to, let me just, other examples, but that's a freaking perfect one.
[00:29:59] No one was happy at the end of that war.
[00:30:03] The risks become greater still in any war that is waged by a coalition.
[00:30:09] For in such a case, a two complete victory inevitably complicates the problem of making
[00:30:15] a Justin Wise peace settlement where there is no longer a counterbalance of an opposing
[00:30:19] force to control the appetite to the victors, there is no check on the conflicting views
[00:30:23] and interests between party Z. Alliance, what a brilliant statement, right?
[00:30:27] This is 19, I guess he's one, this is, so this is after World War 2.
[00:30:33] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:30:34] It has to be, I mean, that reference to American Russia like that.
[00:30:38] Yep, cool.
[00:30:39] Yep.
[00:30:40] We work together.
[00:30:41] And as soon as we don't have our common enemy anymore, now we're pissed at each other.
[00:30:47] The divergences then apt to come so acute as to turn the comradeship of common danger
[00:30:53] into the hostility of mutual dissatisfaction.
[00:30:55] So the ally of one war becomes the enemy in the next, there you go.
[00:30:59] Hello, sovia Union.
[00:31:01] Yeah.
[00:31:02] Versus America.
[00:31:03] This raises a further and wider question.
[00:31:07] The friction that commonly develops in any alliance system, especially when it has no balancing
[00:31:12] force has been one of the factors that have fostered numerous attempts throughout fist
[00:31:17] history to find solution infusion.
[00:31:21] So joining together, this is like an opulatoon.
[00:31:25] You have a platoon.
[00:31:27] If you leave them alone for a little while, they'll start fighting each other.
[00:31:30] That's just what's going to happen.
[00:31:34] There's no balancing forces, no one to go against.
[00:31:36] Even if it's this, the training cadre.
[00:31:38] That's enough of a, you know, we'll go against those guys, our another platoon.
[00:31:41] Once they're alone, they're going to start fighting each other.
[00:31:45] So we look for solutions infusion, but history teaches us that in practice, this is apt
[00:31:50] to mean domination by one of the constituent elements.
[00:31:54] And although there is a natural tendency toward the fusion of small groups and a larger
[00:31:57] ones, the usual result of forcing the pace is the confusion of the plans to establish
[00:32:02] a comprehensive political unit.
[00:32:05] Kind of it.
[00:32:06] I will say that's a pretty pessimistic view.
[00:32:08] It's a realistic view, but it's a pessimistic view.
[00:32:12] More over regrettable as it may seem to the idealist, the experience of history provides
[00:32:16] little warmth for the belief that real progress and the freedom that makes progress possible
[00:32:20] wise and unification.
[00:32:21] And this is something we need to pay attention to.
[00:32:24] For where unification has been able to establish unity of ideas, it has usually ended
[00:32:29] in uniformity, paralyzing the growth of new ideas.
[00:32:35] And where unification has merely brought about an artificial or imposed unity, it is
[00:32:39] Erksom.
[00:32:41] It's Erksomness has led through discord to disruption.
[00:32:45] I love that from a leadership perspective.
[00:32:50] We get everyone on board with a plan.
[00:32:52] Hey, listen, everyone just lock it up.
[00:32:53] We're going with my plan.
[00:32:55] It seems to help, right?
[00:32:57] It seems to help, but by the way, no one's now thinking.
[00:33:00] And on top of that, people are pissed.
[00:33:02] Discord.
[00:33:04] So now as soon as something goes wrong, we got an element that's breaking off.
[00:33:08] You got people complaining.
[00:33:10] Why is that?
[00:33:11] We're trying to force uniformity.
[00:33:14] We're trying to force people to think the same way.
[00:33:17] It's a problem.
[00:33:20] Vitality springs from diversity, which makes for real progress so long as there is mutual
[00:33:25] toleration.
[00:33:28] Based on the recognition that worse may come from an attempt to suppress differences
[00:33:32] than from acceptance of them.
[00:33:35] Again, if you're in a leader and you got someone that's a little outside the lines
[00:33:39] and all you do is beat them into submission, it's not helping.
[00:33:45] For this reason, the kind of piece that makes progress possible is best assured by the mutual
[00:33:50] checks created by a balance of forces alike in the sphere of internal politics and of
[00:33:56] international relations.
[00:34:00] So he goes into a little bit about the balance of power and politics.
[00:34:10] He says any monopoly of power leads to ever repeated demonstrations of the historical truth,
[00:34:16] epitomized and Lord Acton's famous dictum all power corrupts and absolute power corrupts
[00:34:20] absolutely.
[00:34:25] Another conclusion which develops from the study of Grand Strategy against the background
[00:34:29] of history is the practical necessity of adapting the general theory of strategy to the
[00:34:33] nature of a nation's fundamental policy.
[00:34:37] God, make sure you're aligned.
[00:34:39] God, make sure you're aligned.
[00:34:43] Goes into the difference between an acquisition of state and a conservative state, meaning
[00:34:51] hey, my state is going out to acquire other properties that we're going to go on the attack
[00:34:56] and a conservative state, which is hey, we're just trying to maintain what we've got.
[00:35:00] The Equisitive State inherently unsatisfied needs to gain victory in order to gain its
[00:35:08] object and must therefore court greater risks in the attempt.
[00:35:12] The conservative state can achieve its object by merely inducing the aggressor to drop his
[00:35:17] attempt at conquest by convincing him that the game is not worth the candle.
[00:35:23] In victory, its victory isn't a real sense attained by foiling one's bid.
[00:35:28] One side's, look, by foiling the other side's bid for victory.
[00:35:33] Indeed, in attempting more, it may defeat its own purpose by exhausting itself so much
[00:35:40] that it's unable to resist other enemies or the internal effects of overstrain.
[00:35:47] If exhaustion in war has killed more states than any foreign assailants and how often do
[00:35:54] we see that in companies?
[00:35:56] How often do we see in companies where they are just going so hard and investing in so
[00:36:02] many different places and chewing up their teams?
[00:36:08] We have to be cognizant of that.
[00:36:17] Waving these factors, the problem that can be seen that the problem of a conservative
[00:36:19] state is to find the type of strategy that is suited to fulfill its inherently more limited
[00:36:24] object in the most strengthened, serving way so as to ensure future as well as presence.
[00:36:31] Now, there's a reason I'm covering this part because of this statement.
[00:36:35] At first glance, it might seem that pure defense would be the most economical method.
[00:36:41] But this implies static defense and historical experience warns us that it is dangerously
[00:36:49] brittle method on which to rely.
[00:36:52] Economy of force and deterrent affect our best combined in defensive offensive method
[00:36:57] based on high mobility that carries the power of a quick repost.
[00:37:06] And a quick repost is a move in fencing.
[00:37:09] It's a thrust in fencing.
[00:37:13] So it's cool to think, you know what?
[00:37:15] We're just going to conserve.
[00:37:16] We're going to stay here.
[00:37:17] We're going to be on the defensive.
[00:37:18] But we have to remember that historically speaking.
[00:37:20] And when he's talking about historically speaking, he's talking about a massive swath of history
[00:37:26] that he's looked at to confirm that you've got to have some offense.
[00:37:31] You've got to be on offense.
[00:37:34] And we say this a lot.
[00:37:35] Like if you're not growing, you're losing totally.
[00:37:42] He's also clearly learned the lesson that he's kind of accused of not applying, which
[00:37:50] is the context to the statements where you say, hey, the conservative approach and
[00:37:58] all by the way, if you're over there thinking that I'm telling you dig in and be conservative,
[00:38:05] that's not what I'm saying.
[00:38:07] And to clarify and have the understanding of the common itself, so the comment or the headline
[00:38:13] doesn't become the story, which he referenced so many times of, hey, the statement became
[00:38:19] its own interpretation, the same became its own truth when it's not really what he meant.
[00:38:25] But he didn't actually take the time to make sure his disciples, his learners understood,
[00:38:30] I'm not saying dig in.
[00:38:31] I'm not saying that.
[00:38:33] And I know if you're hearing that, let me be more clear what this approach really
[00:38:36] means.
[00:38:37] And that's clearly a lesson he's taken from.
[00:38:40] The other leaders that didn't do that and the outcomes of that creates when you don't
[00:38:44] actually explain what you mean.
[00:38:45] We talked about almost as a joke inside of your, don't care, or you know, hold the line.
[00:38:50] And if you're hearing, I hold the line on all things.
[00:38:53] Let me be more clear.
[00:38:54] That's not what I'm saying.
[00:38:55] I'm saying this, this, and this, and this, and this, and how you apply this.
[00:38:58] So I really like the idea that he's taking the comment and then giving the context around
[00:39:02] us people can understand what he's talking about.
[00:39:04] The people that are actually studying what he's saying.
[00:39:07] The idea of the dichotomy of leadership, that idea came to me because I was working with
[00:39:16] these young junior officers.
[00:39:18] And you know what they want to do?
[00:39:19] They want to do good.
[00:39:21] They want to do good.
[00:39:23] So if you tell them to be aggressive, cool, got it.
[00:39:29] They are on freaking level 14, berserk remote.
[00:39:32] They're charging into whatever.
[00:39:35] You tell them not to move.
[00:39:41] You tell them, hey, make sure you take the high ground.
[00:39:45] Cool, guess what they're doing.
[00:39:47] They're running to the top of every freaking hill that they see.
[00:39:51] Yeah.
[00:39:52] So, so anything that I would tell them, there was a, there was, they had a proclivity
[00:39:56] to take it to the extreme.
[00:39:59] And so within like one or two iterations at our land warfare training facility, I was
[00:40:06] like, okay, I got to tell these guys that there has to be balance.
[00:40:09] That everything that I'm saying has to be balanced.
[00:40:10] Every single thing that I'm saying has to be balanced.
[00:40:12] If you take anything that I'm saying and you take it to an extreme, it's going to be
[00:40:15] bad.
[00:40:19] So I tried to do the same thing.
[00:40:22] It's kind of a universal, I mean, I hate to say it's like a cop out.
[00:40:28] You know, because it's like, you know, if your ego's, you're saying ego's no good.
[00:40:32] No, actually, it's a balance, right?
[00:40:34] And it kind of sounds like a cop out.
[00:40:35] Does it sound like a little bit of a cop out?
[00:40:36] Echo channels, you seem to agree with me.
[00:40:38] Yeah, I mean, it can, yeah, but no.
[00:40:42] Yes, but no.
[00:40:43] I mean, it's a real bummer, I think, not a bummer, but someone will say, well, you're
[00:40:47] saying that, you know, you're saying that the ego is bad, but the ego's, the ego's, you
[00:40:53] know, I don't want to hire people that bunch of pushovers.
[00:40:56] Yeah.
[00:40:57] Yeah, I know man, that's the dichotomy and they're kind of like, oh, they're like,
[00:41:02] they think I don't have that, they forget that I have that.
[00:41:05] You know, and it's why I feel like bad sometimes pulling the dichotomy card, but it's the
[00:41:09] truth.
[00:41:10] Yeah.
[00:41:11] The truth is, man, you take something to the extreme and it's bad.
[00:41:14] Yeah.
[00:41:15] That's the truth.
[00:41:17] You still don't like it?
[00:41:18] No, I agree with you where it's like, you know that it's not a cop out.
[00:41:24] In fact, it's the opposite of a cop out.
[00:41:29] Yeah.
[00:41:30] It's just more to it than that.
[00:41:31] In fact, when someone doesn't recognize the dichotomy, that might be the more of the
[00:41:35] cop out.
[00:41:36] It's kind of like, oh, you say go here, oh, I went there.
[00:41:38] I went there.
[00:41:39] That's what you said, right?
[00:41:40] It's like, right, you got to start using your judgment a little bit.
[00:41:42] You know?
[00:41:43] Yep.
[00:41:44] You were talking about, does it sound like a cop out?
[00:41:50] And in the scenarios of top-gun, you know, everything is like a scenario.
[00:41:55] What do I do in this situation?
[00:41:56] How do I react?
[00:41:57] And like the classic answer, the classic answer was always, it depends.
[00:42:03] Which had this feeling of like, it's a cop out.
[00:42:06] It's a cop out and like, oh, you don't really know or you don't have to be definitive
[00:42:09] because at their times when people want a black and white, they want a black and white
[00:42:13] answer.
[00:42:14] If I have this situation, what do I do?
[00:42:15] It depends.
[00:42:16] Well, it actually depends.
[00:42:17] But it actually does depend.
[00:42:21] It's not a cop out.
[00:42:22] It does.
[00:42:23] Because it's not satisfying and it requires like contemplation and understanding of the
[00:42:30] nuance and how did I get here in the first place?
[00:42:32] What am I trying to accomplish?
[00:42:34] So I was just thinking to myself when you were talking about this feeling of it sounds
[00:42:41] like a cop out was the answer I gave 5000 times a top-gun to the students.
[00:42:45] It depends.
[00:42:46] And then you got a digging and go through it and go, well actually in the case that you're
[00:42:50] describing, this might actually be a better answer than in the same situation but driven
[00:42:54] by another goal or got there for a different reason, hey, I might go a different direction
[00:42:59] here.
[00:43:00] And then you as a leader have to actually apply some judgment in real time as opposed to this
[00:43:04] situation requires this response.
[00:43:05] Well, it's not that simple.
[00:43:07] Hey, a salty leader.
[00:43:08] What are you doing way back there when they're all bogged down up in the front?
[00:43:11] Yeah.
[00:43:12] Well, you told me not to get engaged in like the room room clearance.
[00:43:14] Totally.
[00:43:15] But they're bogged down.
[00:43:16] Yeah.
[00:43:17] That you're example of where should the platoon commander be in a patrol?
[00:43:22] It depends.
[00:43:23] Yeah, where it makes sense.
[00:43:24] Totally.
[00:43:25] Could be in the front?
[00:43:26] Could be in the back?
[00:43:27] Could be in the middle?
[00:43:29] No.
[00:43:30] And I guess we've hit this.
[00:43:31] I'm probably beating at dead horse a little bit but the unsatisfying nature of that answer
[00:43:36] when I got to the basic school.
[00:43:39] I'm a brand new second lieutenant.
[00:43:42] And we get to the the the the basic school and right outside of the main headquarters building
[00:43:48] is this giant bronze statue of the lieutenant.
[00:43:52] And he's in this post.
[00:43:53] He's got his rifle.
[00:43:54] His porno's arm up and it says follow me.
[00:43:57] You know, which is what they push you.
[00:44:00] He's lead from the front.
[00:44:02] Get out in front of your man.
[00:44:04] And in a lot of ways.
[00:44:07] That's right.
[00:44:08] That's right.
[00:44:09] To have that.
[00:44:10] But in a lot of ways, it's actually not right.
[00:44:13] But place yourself where you need to be is nowhere near as cool as cool as follow me.
[00:44:23] Lead from the front.
[00:44:25] But if that's what you hey, I lead from the front like cool.
[00:44:27] You have no idea what's going on back here.
[00:44:28] And half of your guys just got hammered because of that.
[00:44:33] There's this, I think this compulsion, which is why the class would think plays so well
[00:44:39] to the, the, the, even just the catch phrases of leadership, which don't actually serve
[00:44:44] a leader very well.
[00:44:46] Lead from the front.
[00:44:47] Who's going to say like that's a terrible leadership philosophy, but actually sometimes
[00:44:50] you don't want to be in the front.
[00:44:51] Yeah, which is why I have a section in leadership strategy and tactics, which is actually
[00:44:55] called lead from the rear.
[00:44:56] Totally.
[00:44:57] So it kind of like, you have to like the more under because there has to be the formula
[00:45:05] right at some level.
[00:45:07] Like obviously at the, at the surface, the formula is like, or you might, someone might
[00:45:12] make them mistake the formula is lead from the front at all times, right?
[00:45:17] But that's not the formula.
[00:45:18] Formal is it depends.
[00:45:19] Okay, on what?
[00:45:20] And there's a formula under there.
[00:45:22] But then under there, you're like, okay, well, if this and this and this, it depends a
[00:45:26] little bit more.
[00:45:27] And the deeper you go, there has to be some formula, right?
[00:45:32] No.
[00:45:33] Okay, so that and that's what I was going to say too here.
[00:45:36] So the, the, the formula, you know what, I have the formula, you know what the formula
[00:45:39] is?
[00:45:40] It's in that economy or Dave will tell you the formula is, it depends.
[00:45:44] Yeah.
[00:45:45] So I feel like, yeah.
[00:45:46] Yeah.
[00:45:47] So both of those are cop out of answers you don't want to hear them.
[00:45:49] No, no, no, no.
[00:45:50] No, no, I'm actually agreeing with you.
[00:45:51] Like that, that's what I would have said too.
[00:45:53] It's going to always depend.
[00:45:55] Okay.
[00:45:56] So, and also on top of it, there's more than one right answer a lot of the time.
[00:46:01] Pretty much all the time, pretty much with very few exceptions, I would think.
[00:46:07] There are wrong answers.
[00:46:08] Oh, yeah, yeah, I agree with that too.
[00:46:10] Okay.
[00:46:11] But you're saying there's more than one right answer.
[00:46:13] Yeah.
[00:46:14] Many cases, yes.
[00:46:15] So I would say the solution is the more you understand about all of it, the better decision
[00:46:21] you can make and the better, the better educated you will be on what decision to make,
[00:46:27] give in the parameters of all of that that caught on me is your dealing with.
[00:46:31] Except for the fact that you may not have enough information to make the decision that
[00:46:36] seems like it's going to be the perfect decision in which case you kind of screwed up by
[00:46:40] not moving a little bit more quickly and making decision based on the information that you
[00:46:44] had at that current moment.
[00:46:46] Yeah.
[00:46:47] But when I'm in, when I'm in, what I'm in by knowing, like educated yourself, not on any
[00:46:53] specific scenario, I'm saying on how it works, on the dichotomy of leadership, on the
[00:46:59] laws of combat or whatever.
[00:47:01] Okay.
[00:47:02] Yes.
[00:47:03] Understand it.
[00:47:04] Well, yeah, then you're going back to what I said, which is the formula is, this is an
[00:47:05] dichotomy and you got to be balanced.
[00:47:07] Yeah.
[00:47:08] That's the formula.
[00:47:09] The formula is be balanced.
[00:47:10] Yeah.
[00:47:11] Like some, the more you know about the whole game, we'll say the more you know when you're
[00:47:15] going to be on this side of the dichotomy or leaning on this side of the dichotomy, the more
[00:47:19] you know about yourself, the more you know about it, your guys, building relationships
[00:47:22] and by the way, the more you know about this and the more you know about how this works,
[00:47:25] then you're going to know more about under what types of circumstances you're going to
[00:47:28] lean here, early in the.
[00:47:30] You know what's cool?
[00:47:32] We have a business called echelon front.
[00:47:34] Yes, sir.
[00:47:35] The reason we have a business called echelon front is because we have to help leaders
[00:47:40] work through these issues.
[00:47:42] We can't give them a formula that they can then apply across the board in all situations.
[00:47:47] But like you're saying, correctly, if they learn to understand the principles,
[00:47:52] they can start to make better decisions and write decisions based on their understanding
[00:47:57] of these principles and applying them holistically to their scenario.
[00:48:02] Right.
[00:48:03] Yes, exactly right.
[00:48:04] Which I was going to say, yeah, exactly what I'm saying, where, where do you get the formula
[00:48:08] from?
[00:48:09] Oh, you're probably the most educated on this whole game as far as the game goes, right?
[00:48:14] So the more you let's say you consult with a client, right?
[00:48:16] The more you consult with them, hopefully the more they're going to learn that same
[00:48:20] game and they're going to need you less and less.
[00:48:23] Yes, that's the goal.
[00:48:24] Yes, sir.
[00:48:25] Absolutely.
[00:48:26] All right, back to the book.
[00:48:31] The East Roman Empire was a case where such an actively conservative strategy had
[00:48:41] been carefully found out as a basis of war policy, a fact which goes far to explain
[00:48:46] this empire's unrivaled span of existence.
[00:48:49] Another example more instinctive than reasoned is provided by the strategy based on
[00:48:54] C power that England practiced in her wars from the 16th to the 19th century.
[00:49:00] The value of it was shown by the way that her strength kept pace with her growth while
[00:49:05] all her rivals broke down and turned through self-exhaustion and war traceable to their
[00:49:11] immoderate desire for the immediate satisfaction of outright victory.
[00:49:19] Along series of mutually exhausting and devastating wars above all the 30 years of war
[00:49:26] has brought head-brought statesmen by the 18th century to realize the necessity when engaged in
[00:49:33] war of curbing both their ambitions and their passions in the interests of their purpose.
[00:49:41] On the one hand, this realization tended to produce a tacit limitation of warfare and avoidance
[00:49:46] of excesses which might damage after the war prospect.
[00:49:50] So he's going back in time and say, look, we can't have learned these lessons.
[00:49:52] It was a regression.
[00:49:54] That's why earlier in the last podcast we talked about, he talked about, class which was
[00:49:58] a regression.
[00:50:00] We are going backwards.
[00:50:02] Because they had figured this stuff out the 30 years war.
[00:50:04] I mean, that's the 1600s you got Germany and Sweden, Sweden, Spain and Catholics.
[00:50:08] First probably, all kinds are crazy.
[00:50:10] Warfare going on to know to know real decisive victory.
[00:50:13] It's a problem they realize that.
[00:50:17] Their ambitions and passions frequently carry them too far so that the return to peace
[00:50:21] found their countries weakened rather than strengthened.
[00:50:25] But they had learned to stop short of national exhaustion.
[00:50:31] Which again, you take that for leadership capital and we're expanding more than we have.
[00:50:38] At the most satisfactory, at the most satisfactory peace settlements, even for the stronger side,
[00:50:45] proved to be those which were made by negotiation rather than decisive military issue.
[00:50:52] This gradually education in inherent limitations of war was still in process when it was interrupted
[00:50:57] by the French Revolution which brought to the top men who were novices in statemanship.
[00:51:04] The directorie and its successor Napoleon pursued the vision of an enduring peace through
[00:51:12] war after war for 20 years.
[00:51:16] There you go.
[00:51:17] Napoleon going for peace, 20 years of war.
[00:51:20] The pursuit never led to the goal but only to spreading exhaustion and ultimate collapse.
[00:51:26] The bankruptcy of the Napoleonic Empire renewed a lesson that had often been taught before.
[00:51:34] The impression however came to be obscured by the sunset haze of the Napoleonic myth,
[00:51:38] the lesson had been forgotten by the time it was repeated in the war of war 1.
[00:51:44] Even after that bitter experience, the statement of the second world war were no wiser.
[00:51:54] Although war is contrary to reason, since it is a mean of deciding issues by force when
[00:52:00] discussion fails to produce an agreed solution, the conduct of war must be controlled by
[00:52:06] reason if its object is to be fulfilled.
[00:52:10] Here he goes into how we reasonably conduct war.
[00:52:17] 1.
[00:52:18] While fighting is a physical act, its direction is a mental process.
[00:52:23] The better your strategy, the easier you will gain the upper hand and the less it will
[00:52:27] cost you.
[00:52:31] Very important thing to think about.
[00:52:34] 2.
[00:52:35] Conversely, the more strength you waste, the more you increase the risk of the scales of war
[00:52:41] turning against you.
[00:52:44] Even if you succeed in winning victory, the less strength you will have to profit by peace.
[00:52:54] Just apply that one to World War 1.
[00:52:56] And its like, okay, we didn't stop this.
[00:52:59] 3.
[00:53:00] The more brutal your methods, the more bitter you will make your opponents with the natural
[00:53:06] result of hardening the resistance you are trying to overcome.
[00:53:11] Plus, the more evenly the two sides are matched, the wiser it will be to avoid extremes
[00:53:16] of violence which tend to consolidate the enemies troops and people behind their leaders.
[00:53:23] I mean, okay, war, yeah, what about leadership perspective on that one?
[00:53:28] No, like the more brutal, the more you shut up they even do and I told you to do.
[00:53:33] Shut up team, this is what we're doing.
[00:53:34] The more you do that, the more resistance you're going to have to overcome.
[00:53:41] 4.
[00:53:42] These calculations extend further.
[00:53:46] The more intent you appear to impose a peace entirely of your own choosing by conquest
[00:53:56] the stiffer, the obstacle you will raise in your path.
[00:54:03] So when I make a peace that's completely, you know, in my favor, cool, I'm going to end
[00:54:08] up with problems.
[00:54:09] And the more I impose a plan on Dave and his team, the more I'm going to end up with
[00:54:13] problems.
[00:54:17] And I can see the looks on the people's faces in a company when I tell them that.
[00:54:24] It's so hard to believe.
[00:54:26] It's so hard to believe that, hey, actually the more efficient way is to say, hey, Dave,
[00:54:29] how do you want to do this?
[00:54:31] It's so hard to believe that.
[00:54:35] It seems so much more efficient for me to say, hey, Dave, here's the plan.
[00:54:37] Shut up and do it.
[00:54:39] They're going to hear, give this to your team.
[00:54:40] Here's the order.
[00:54:41] Let's go execute.
[00:54:46] Which is funny, because people go, oh, you know, these military, these military wave leading
[00:54:50] wouldn't work in the civilian world.
[00:54:51] It's like, what are you talking about?
[00:54:53] It's always fun.
[00:54:54] Life's like, yeah, yeah, this is what exactly what Jockel did with me.
[00:54:57] He'd be like, hey, how do you want to do it?
[00:54:58] And I'd be like, how does this sound?
[00:54:59] I think we'd plan on this.
[00:55:00] Okay, cool.
[00:55:02] Five, furthermore, if and when you reach your military goal, the more you ask of the defeated
[00:55:14] side, the more trouble you will have.
[00:55:16] And the more cause you will have to provide for an ultimate attempt to reverse the settlement
[00:55:21] achieved by war.
[00:55:23] Again, when you impose your plan on people, when you impose your will on people, there
[00:55:29] will be Oregon rejection of that.
[00:55:37] Force is a vicious cycle or rather a spiral unless its application is controlled by the
[00:55:45] most carefully seasoned calculation.
[00:55:50] Just think about that.
[00:55:51] Is it common thing I tell clients?
[00:55:54] You want to lead with minimum force required.
[00:55:55] Tell you want to lead.
[00:55:56] If I don't have to say anything that's the best.
[00:55:58] If I have to say, hey, this is maybe an idea.
[00:56:01] If I get to a point where I have to bark in order to someone and tell them, shut up and
[00:56:03] do what I told you to do, that's bad.
[00:56:05] That's the vicious circle of force.
[00:56:08] We don't like it.
[00:56:10] Thus war, which begins by denying reason, comes to vindicated, vindicated throughout all
[00:56:18] phases of the struggle.
[00:56:22] The fighting instinct is necessary to success in the battlefield.
[00:56:27] Although even here, the combatant who can keep a cool head has an advantage over the man
[00:56:38] who sees red.
[00:56:43] That's his little caveat.
[00:56:45] He says, but the fighting instinct should always be written on a tight reign.
[00:56:52] The statesman who gives that instinct, it's head loses his own.
[00:56:57] If you just want to scrap cool, guess what's going to happen?
[00:57:00] You're going to lose your own head.
[00:57:02] He's not fit to take charge of the fate of a nation.
[00:57:10] Victory in the true sense implies that the state of peace and of one's people is better
[00:57:16] after the war than before.
[00:57:20] The only thing in this sense is only possible if a quick result can be gained or if a
[00:57:24] long effort can be economically proportioned to the national resources.
[00:57:29] How much are you investing?
[00:57:32] How much are you investing of capital from your company?
[00:57:35] How much are you investing in leadership capital?
[00:57:39] ROI, where's it at?
[00:57:42] The end must be adjusted to the means.
[00:57:46] We throw that one out all the time.
[00:57:49] And it's got the connotations of being a whim.
[00:57:54] Focus on your goal.
[00:57:55] There's 48 freaking inspirational memes a day set your goal and never fear from it.
[00:58:08] Cool.
[00:58:09] I got a better idea.
[00:58:10] How about the end must be adjusted to the means?
[00:58:14] Right?
[00:58:15] I want that Lambo.
[00:58:19] I want a dream board.
[00:58:20] I got a Lambo and I got an infinity pool.
[00:58:25] Cool.
[00:58:26] How's that Wendy's salary kicking in?
[00:58:31] Right?
[00:58:32] Adjust your means a little bit, man.
[00:58:35] Adjust the end to fit the means.
[00:58:37] Sure.
[00:58:38] Oh, this is again.
[00:58:40] No one's there's no there's no there's not one single inspirational
[00:58:45] meme on the gram that says that says the end must be adjusted to the means.
[00:58:50] No one says that.
[00:58:51] Actually it's the opposite.
[00:58:52] It's far as in the inspirational quotes industry.
[00:58:56] Well, for lack of a better job.
[00:58:58] It's the exact opposite.
[00:58:59] Actually, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:00] It's like, hey, basically it's like a kid.
[00:59:02] Adjust the means to the means.
[00:59:04] Or the incident means.
[00:59:05] So it's kind of like, hey, don't freaking have this goal that's unrealistic essentially.
[00:59:11] Essentially.
[00:59:12] Like, it's unrealistic, right?
[00:59:15] It's irresponsible.
[00:59:16] It's irresponsible.
[00:59:17] You have an irresponsible goal right there.
[00:59:18] You can like whatever kill yourself doing it.
[00:59:21] You should go in the comment should be like your dumb should be right given
[00:59:25] that.
[00:59:26] Right?
[00:59:27] But they'll talk about it.
[00:59:28] There's someone right now that's going to hear this bill.
[00:59:30] I'm just going to bullshit.
[00:59:31] I'm just going to shit.
[00:59:32] Yeah.
[00:59:33] I'm going to shit you.
[00:59:34] You're dead.
[00:59:35] Oh, yeah.
[00:59:36] If you're down for the thing and I get it because I'm all tap.
[00:59:38] Well, heart like if you want to be a bit, you know, for your first 100 million.
[00:59:44] Oh yeah.
[00:59:45] Yeah.
[00:59:46] There's people that tap that twice.
[00:59:47] Oh yeah.
[00:59:48] Right?
[00:59:49] 100% yes or in.
[00:59:50] And like for a moment, they're kind of like pumped.
[00:59:53] Yeah, I'm sure they're pumped the whole time.
[00:59:56] You tell the end.
[00:59:57] It's really, but no.
[00:59:59] Well, if you're the guy, if you're the guy who says this, what this book is saying, hey,
[01:00:03] like the end must be adjusted to the means.
[01:00:05] That's a good goal.
[01:00:06] Like that's a lofty goal.
[01:00:07] Which, you know, obviously I can't hate unlofty goals.
[01:00:11] Wait, that's not even really a lofty goal.
[01:00:12] That's just a realistic thing to do as a human.
[01:00:14] But the realistic human means.
[01:00:18] Yeah.
[01:00:19] Well, you know, the first one will be the end must be adjusted to the means.
[01:00:22] It's very not inspirational.
[01:00:24] They would get downvoted.
[01:00:25] Yeah.
[01:00:26] You'll be branded as the hate or really.
[01:00:28] Oh.
[01:00:29] Like that's the point where they, they'll brand you as a hate.
[01:00:31] It's like everyone's always hating.
[01:00:32] And you know where this goes into the whole idea.
[01:00:36] You're talking about of like, about hey, this isn't really sexy.
[01:00:42] This is the absolute like, non, this is getting downvoted.
[01:00:46] This is getting haters.
[01:00:47] Oh yeah.
[01:00:48] And what's interesting is who you're going to, who's going to get the up vote, right?
[01:00:54] This person is getting, you're getting hated all.
[01:00:56] Oh yeah.
[01:00:57] Because you're like, actually, it's an unrealistic goal.
[01:00:59] You should check yourself.
[01:01:00] Right.
[01:01:01] All the downer, the doubter, right?
[01:01:02] Oh yeah.
[01:01:03] The doubter.
[01:01:04] Yeah.
[01:01:05] And the thing is that get it.
[01:01:06] Because everyone's in a great while you'll get someone who achieved this super lofty
[01:01:09] goal, not to say that they didn't just the ends to the means.
[01:01:12] Because they had the means up, currently at the end of the day, the means were there.
[01:01:16] Because they end is there to run.
[01:01:18] But he was the thing they had that un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un inspirational names.
[01:01:24] We'll just say realistic realistic means.
[01:01:26] Yeah.
[01:01:27] But unless they, they achieved that goal that was kind of untyp, not typically realistic.
[01:01:34] It's unrealistic, right?
[01:01:35] Compared to we speaking to whatever.
[01:01:38] And they achieved it.
[01:01:40] I mean, we could easily argue that like, oh, this person did this because they had
[01:01:46] the mean.
[01:01:47] The means, right?
[01:01:48] That had the intellectual horsepower.
[01:01:50] They had the educational thing.
[01:01:52] They had the how always things set up.
[01:01:54] Oh, it's actually a realistic goal.
[01:01:55] I know that.
[01:01:56] That's what I'm saying.
[01:01:57] Where.
[01:01:58] But they'll take the, the crazy quantum, quote, unrealistic ends, right?
[01:02:04] The goal will say.
[01:02:05] But that's the one, right?
[01:02:06] The classic president of the United States.
[01:02:08] You can do anything you want.
[01:02:09] I'm going to send my goal the highest I possibly can in life, president of the United
[01:02:12] States.
[01:02:13] Right?
[01:02:14] So it'll be like, all right, cool.
[01:02:16] Therefore, we should all essentially set goals as high as president of the United States.
[01:02:21] Right?
[01:02:22] Okay.
[01:02:23] That's kind of the inspirational message, right?
[01:02:26] Okay.
[01:02:27] Meanwhile, the very few individuals that became president of the United States had
[01:02:31] the means.
[01:02:33] So they're ends technically by definition, we're adjusted.
[01:02:38] Their ends were adjusted to the means because they had the means.
[01:02:41] It's the same.
[01:02:42] Not everyone has the means.
[01:02:43] So you've got to adjust those.
[01:02:45] Yeah.
[01:02:46] Meanwhile, everyone's saying new, new, new, new, new, new.
[01:02:48] Don't if you can do it, I can do it too, right?
[01:02:51] Which, hey, I'm not saying they can't.
[01:02:53] I'm not even saying that.
[01:02:54] But I'm saying, hey, man, you've got to be realistic.
[01:02:57] Realistic on that can stuff.
[01:02:59] Yeah.
[01:03:00] Same saying.
[01:03:01] If you say that, you just can't say that.
[01:03:03] You know what's really crazy is like, I just got slapped in my own face thinking about
[01:03:08] this because we're kind of joking about this.
[01:03:12] But what he's saying and what he saw was hundreds and hundreds of thousands of soldiers
[01:03:20] that were killed because the leadership didn't adjust the ends to the means.
[01:03:26] Totally.
[01:03:27] Which is crazy to think about.
[01:03:29] As you guys are talking, I was thinking my mind, like, people have figured this out.
[01:03:34] There are even phrases out there.
[01:03:36] The one I kept thinking of as you're talking about this is I remember the phrase, live
[01:03:41] within your means.
[01:03:42] Like, I've heard that's a phrase.
[01:03:45] What it's not is it's not hanging on a poster in any kid's bedroom anywhere.
[01:03:50] Like, I don't go to bed tonight.
[01:03:51] Like it's an unreal going.
[01:03:52] I'm going to live within my means.
[01:03:55] The irony inside that is the best way to actually, ultimately expand your means over
[01:04:01] time so your means get greater and greater is to do exactly that.
[01:04:04] Like, that's the trick to it is the dissatisfaction of the reality is something people overlook.
[01:04:13] And the the unfunny part of that, which is the sobering piece that you just mentioned is that
[01:04:19] it can actually lead people down a path to do exactly what you just said.
[01:04:24] Which, which almost seems not possible except for the fact that these that he specifically
[01:04:31] live that in a way that is, what are we doing here?
[01:04:36] What are we doing?
[01:04:37] What are we expanding to a and what are we accomplishing by doing that?
[01:04:41] So it wasn't just the national exhaustion.
[01:04:44] It was the national exhaustion with nothing to show for it.
[01:04:47] And then the scale of that, which is, which is impossible as opposed to, hey, why don't
[01:04:53] we operate within our means here?
[01:04:55] Why don't we do that?
[01:04:56] Yeah.
[01:04:57] And if you fast forward the kid, if there was a kid that had a post on a wall that
[01:05:01] certainly lived within your means and therefore they're saving and they're putting together.
[01:05:05] And you look at them in 20 years and they're in a way better position than something
[01:05:09] that was like, you know, you need the Lambo for whatever.
[01:05:14] Right?
[01:05:15] Because they're going to end up in debt and they can't invest properly.
[01:05:20] And they have to work a job that they don't really like and it's a job that's a dead
[01:05:24] end job.
[01:05:25] I like all these things add up.
[01:05:27] You said something about you being an NBA basketball player.
[01:05:31] I would say on record, on a inspirational or demotivational post saying, hey, bro, that's
[01:05:37] unrealistic.
[01:05:38] I would tell you that.
[01:05:40] And I think factually it is under, well, just as factually goes, it is unrealistic.
[01:05:45] I don't know that I would tell a high school kid that when he's really into basketball.
[01:05:51] I don't know if I would say that.
[01:05:54] It'd be unrealistic in certain ways, like if the underserved circumstances or whatever,
[01:05:58] but given how you consider it most people how they get into professional sports whenever
[01:06:02] they work hard, they really love the sport.
[01:06:05] They go through trials and tribulations or whatever and they end up making it kind of a thing.
[01:06:09] So if you get someone that's kind of in the beginning of that type of path where that
[01:06:14] path is not straight up blocked off or whatever reason, like it would be in your case,
[01:06:18] I wouldn't really say that's unrealistic.
[01:06:20] The point is there are really cases where it's unrealistic.
[01:06:26] So if you tried to be an NBA player, hired the best coach in the world, I get it.
[01:06:33] You would wind up exhausting all your research.
[01:06:37] I should adjust my end.
[01:06:38] I'm going to answer.
[01:06:41] You might want to make sure that you're a kid who you don't want to stifle that dream,
[01:06:46] you might want to make sure that they're not putting all the rags in that one basket
[01:06:49] and two.
[01:06:50] Hey, listen, go for it.
[01:06:52] But you're not going to drop out of school.
[01:06:55] You're not going to stop doing this in this with the ultimate meme of focus on your goals
[01:07:03] and block out every distraction.
[01:07:05] So I'm done with school because school is stupid because school ain't going to help
[01:07:08] me be an NBA player.
[01:07:09] Meanwhile, you're five, six, you're done growing.
[01:07:13] You're not that good of a shot, but you've got this passion.
[01:07:16] You might want to keep that kid on the track of, hey, cool.
[01:07:19] I'm out here to crush your dreams.
[01:07:20] However, comma, let's consider some other things as you're doing that.
[01:07:24] Actually, you should never have a plan B.
[01:07:25] That means you're not fully committed to a plan B.
[01:07:27] That's right.
[01:07:28] You've got a plan B.
[01:07:29] I guess you're not committed to planning.
[01:07:30] There's inspirational meme for you.
[01:07:32] Actually, he addresses some of this here.
[01:07:35] Going back to the book, failing a fair prospect of such a victory.
[01:07:38] So the end must be adjusted to me as failing a fair prospect of such a victory.
[01:07:42] Why statesmanship will miss no opportunity for negotiating peace.
[01:07:47] Peace through stalemate based on a coincident recognition by each side of the opponent's
[01:07:53] strength is at least preferable to peace through common exhaustion and has often provided
[01:07:59] a better foundation for lasting peace.
[01:08:03] It is wiser to run risks of war for the sake of preserving peace than to risk run the
[01:08:10] risk of exhaustion in war for the sake of finishing with victory.
[01:08:17] A conclusion that runs counter to custom but is supported by experience.
[01:08:25] So it's better to like, maybe we don't have war and we just kind of maintain peace with
[01:08:31] kind of what I've got.
[01:08:33] That's a better deal than you know what.
[01:08:35] We're just going to exhaust ourselves and hope for some kind of a victory.
[01:08:43] Perseverance in war is only justifiable if there is a good chance of a good end.
[01:08:51] The prospect of a peace that will balance the sum of human misery incurred in the struggle.
[01:08:58] Like each one of these statements, Dave, you just shake your head knowing where it came from.
[01:09:04] That's all I'm thinking is every one of these is what he, what this comes from, it's
[01:09:08] just how savage that experience had it with been for him.
[01:09:14] Indeed, deepening the study of past experience leads to the conclusion that nations might
[01:09:19] often have come nearer to their object by taking advantage of a low in the struggle to
[01:09:23] discuss a settlement than by pursuing the war with the aim of victory.
[01:09:30] History, so look man, you got to look for those opportunities.
[01:09:33] We have a little low, hey, you want to keep going with us, or you want to maybe stand down.
[01:09:38] History reveals also that in many cases a beneficial peace could have been obtained if
[01:09:42] the statesmen of the warring nations had shown more understanding of the elements of psychology
[01:09:47] and their peace feelers.
[01:09:49] So you get the peace feelers out there like, what?
[01:09:53] Let me sense about what's happening here.
[01:09:56] And people don't have good understanding of their peace.
[01:09:58] They don't recognize their peace feelers.
[01:10:02] Their attitude is commonly been to akin to that scene in the typical domestic quarry.
[01:10:09] Right?
[01:10:10] So now we've got to fight with our wife.
[01:10:12] Each party is afraid to appear yielding with the result that when one of them shows any
[01:10:17] inclination towards consolation, this is usually expressed in language that is too stiff.
[01:10:24] While the other is apt to be slow to respond partly from pride or or obscency and partly
[01:10:29] from a tendency to interpret such a gesture as a sign of weakness when it may be a sign of
[01:10:33] returning to common sense.
[01:10:34] The classic, right?
[01:10:36] I'm not going to apologize.
[01:10:38] I'm just saying you're sorry.
[01:10:40] Yeah, just saying you're sorry.
[01:10:41] Sorry.
[01:10:42] Don't look weak.
[01:10:43] Thus, the faithful moment of passes and the conflict continues to the common damage.
[01:10:49] Right?
[01:10:50] We are killing ourselves over something that we could easily say, hey, look, I'm sorry,
[01:10:54] it's my fault.
[01:10:58] Rarely does a continuation serve any good purpose where the two parties are bound to
[01:11:02] go on living under the same roof.
[01:11:04] This applies even more to modern war than to domestic conflict since the industrialization
[01:11:09] of nations has made their fortunes inseparable.
[01:11:14] It is the responsibility of statesmanship never to lose sight of the post war prospect
[01:11:19] in chasing the mirage of victory.
[01:11:28] Where two, where the two sides are two evenly matched to offer reasonable chance of early
[01:11:33] success to either the statesman is wise who can learn something from the psychology of strategy.
[01:11:40] It is the elementary principle of strategy that if you find your opponent in a strong position
[01:11:45] costly to force, you should leave him a line of retreat as the quickest way of loosening
[01:11:50] his resistance.
[01:11:51] Get personal way out.
[01:11:54] It should equally be the principal policy, especially in order to provide your opponent
[01:11:57] with a ladder by which he can climb down.
[01:12:00] Get people away out.
[01:12:03] Give your wife away out in that argument.
[01:12:06] Give your subordinate away out in that argument.
[01:12:09] Give your boss away out.
[01:12:12] Don't make them dig in, don't make them fight to the death.
[01:12:17] The question may arise as to whether such conclusions based on the history of war between
[01:12:22] so-called civilized states apply to the conditions inherent in a renewal of the type of purely
[01:12:28] predatory war that was waged by the barbarian assailants of the Roman Empire or the mixed
[01:12:35] religious and predatory war that was pursued by the fanatical followers of Mohammed.
[01:12:43] In such wars, any negotiated peace tends to have in itself even less than the normal
[01:12:51] value.
[01:12:52] It is only two clear from the history that states rarely keep the faith with each other,
[01:12:57] save in so far and so long as their promises seem to them to combine with their interests.
[01:13:04] That's a good thing to note.
[01:13:06] I'm not going to keep any promises if they're not from my benefit.
[01:13:10] That's what history tells us.
[01:13:12] And now we're talking about extremists, whether it's the barbarians attacking the Romans
[01:13:19] or the Islamists attacking the West back in the day.
[01:13:29] The less that a nation has regard for moral obligations, the more it tends to respect
[01:13:36] physical strength, the deterrent power of a force too strong to be challenged with the
[01:13:39] beauty.
[01:13:40] You got somebody that's not going to, you make peace with them, but you don't trust them,
[01:13:44] guess what?
[01:13:45] You better be strong.
[01:13:47] People don't respect the moral obligation they respect strength.
[01:13:55] In the same way, with individuals, it is a matter of common experience that the bully
[01:13:59] type and the Robert type hesitate to assail anyone who approaches their own strength.
[01:14:04] Check.
[01:14:05] You don't see the bully picking on the big yoke-dupe guy with cauliflower ears.
[01:14:14] It is folly to imagine that the aggressive types of weather individuals or nations can
[01:14:18] be bought off or in modern language appeased since the payment of dangheld simulates
[01:14:25] a demand for more dangheld.
[01:14:28] What's dangheld you asked?
[01:14:31] It's Viking protection money.
[01:14:34] Like hey, you can live here.
[01:14:36] I need some dangheld.
[01:14:37] You got to pay me a little bit of something.
[01:14:41] And what does that do?
[01:14:43] Makes me want more.
[01:14:45] Oh, the Viking?
[01:14:46] Yeah.
[01:14:47] But dang, I need some protection money from you.
[01:14:50] You can work this corner, but you got to give me my cut.
[01:14:54] What does that make me want more cut?
[01:14:58] So you can't buy them off.
[01:15:01] But they can be curb.
[01:15:02] They're very belief in force makes it more susceptible to the deterrent effect of a formidable
[01:15:07] opposing force. This forms an adequate check except against pure fanaticism, a fanaticism
[01:15:13] that is unmixed.
[01:15:17] So you get pure fanaticism, it doesn't matter if I'm going to kill you or not.
[01:15:21] You're going to come.
[01:15:25] While it is hard to make real peace with the predatory types, it is easier to induce them
[01:15:30] to accept the state of truth and far less exhausting than an attempt to crush them whereby
[01:15:36] they are like all types of mankind infused with the courage of desperation.
[01:15:42] So we have to be strong.
[01:15:47] You have to be strong.
[01:15:50] And look, if you're stronger than these predatory fanatics, it doesn't necessarily mean
[01:15:56] you want to go to war with them because they're going to fight desperately.
[01:16:00] But if you're strong and you can keep them in check, that's sort of a good balance
[01:16:03] of power that's acceptable.
[01:16:08] I don't know how many more you've got on this, but I'm just thinking of all the things
[01:16:14] he's describing, all the behavior and the reaction, the action and the reaction.
[01:16:20] It's all human nature.
[01:16:22] This is how they will respond to this.
[01:16:27] And the repetitiveness and he keeps coming back to this idea is like, this is not
[01:16:33] a sample size of one.
[01:16:35] This isn't just one thing that's happened in history.
[01:16:38] And I think that's the power of the idea of human nature.
[01:16:40] This is how people will react.
[01:16:42] This is how people will respond.
[01:16:43] And if you understand human nature, that to us is the foundation of leadership.
[01:16:51] This is a human nature endeavor.
[01:16:53] Understanding how people will react.
[01:16:57] And anytime we behave in the extremes, there will be a reaction to that.
[01:17:02] To us operating in the extremes, there will be a natural human reaction to some other
[01:17:07] extreme.
[01:17:08] And the easy, like, hey, you want to subduge human nature, be moderate, limit the natural
[01:17:14] reaction.
[01:17:15] Hey, have a little bit of something over here, have a little something over here, but just
[01:17:18] listening to all the things you're saying is a human nature, human nature, human nature.
[01:17:21] Yeah.
[01:17:22] And the response to be balanced, be balanced, be balanced, be balanced.
[01:17:25] Be defined, be defined, be in the middle to limit to minimize the reaction that you're
[01:17:30] going to get.
[01:17:35] Total war.
[01:17:36] Cool.
[01:17:37] You win.
[01:17:38] Guess what you got now?
[01:17:39] You got an insurgency.
[01:17:40] It's going to last for 20 years.
[01:17:41] And is that really what you want?
[01:17:43] Or could you maybe operate with some restraint understanding that what you're really
[01:17:47] trying to do is not beat them?
[01:17:48] What you're really trying to do is create a piece for a couple of decades, maybe?
[01:17:52] Could you think of the long game here?
[01:17:54] Again, that's probably not going on a post or somewhere.
[01:18:00] So you're not getting recruited into the Marine Corps without one.
[01:18:06] Here's a little warning for us.
[01:18:12] The experience of history brings ample evidence that the downfall of civilized states tends
[01:18:17] to come out from the direct assaults of foes, but from internal decay combined with the consequences
[01:18:25] of exhaustion in war.
[01:18:30] That's a little warning.
[01:18:34] A state of suspense is trying.
[01:18:40] And as usage of the word suspense, there is like mental indecision.
[01:18:45] A state of suspense or mental indecision is trying.
[01:18:50] It is often lead nations as well as individuals to commit suicide because they were
[01:18:55] unable to bear it.
[01:18:59] But suspense is better than to reach exhaustion in pursuit of the mirage of victory.
[01:19:07] That's a bold statement.
[01:19:09] So indecision can be so bad.
[01:19:11] This existence of indecision can be so bad that you can destroy yourself.
[01:19:16] You can kill yourself.
[01:19:18] You want to kill yourself.
[01:19:22] But that's actually better than to just exhaust yourself completely in pursuit of a victory
[01:19:29] that can't be had.
[01:19:32] What's counter intuitive about that is this idea that humans, we need to go towards.
[01:19:41] We need to go.
[01:19:42] We need something.
[01:19:43] We want something.
[01:19:44] We want to struggle.
[01:19:45] We want to fight.
[01:19:46] What he's saying here is like, let's think twice about that one.
[01:19:51] And I think it's probably because he understands what the true exhaustion of a state looks
[01:20:01] like.
[01:20:05] On a scale that most people can't comprehend.
[01:20:10] He said this before I remember it, the mirage of victory, the mirage.
[01:20:16] What you are seeing, this goal that you are working towards, it's actually not a thing.
[01:20:20] It's not a real thing, it's a mirage.
[01:20:22] And you've convinced yourself, victory for me is I defeat Jocca.
[01:20:26] That's victory.
[01:20:27] And I am going to move towards that until it happens.
[01:20:30] But that's actually not a real thing.
[01:20:31] It's not a real thing.
[01:20:33] Yeah.
[01:20:34] It's not a real thing.
[01:20:35] And what you'll end up with is an insurgency.
[01:20:38] Or exhaustive.
[01:20:39] Or exhaustive.
[01:20:40] Or whatever else.
[01:20:41] Or you'll rule over the Baron Wasteland that I left.
[01:20:44] Right.
[01:20:44] More over a truce to actual hostility.
[01:20:50] Enables a recovery and development of strength while the need for vigilance keeps a nation
[01:20:57] on its toes.
[01:21:00] So we're looking for a truce.
[01:21:02] It's OK.
[01:21:03] Peaceful nations are apt however to court unnecessary danger because when once aroused, they
[01:21:09] are more inclined to proceed to extremes than predatory nations.
[01:21:16] Interesting.
[01:21:17] This is like the guy that's sort of quiet and keep me to himself.
[01:21:21] But when you piss them off, then they freaking go ham.
[01:21:29] That's a technical definition as well.
[01:21:32] For the latter making war as a means of gain are usually more ready to call it often.
[01:21:37] They find an opponent too strong or too easily overcome.
[01:21:42] And this is really the last point for this book that we're going to talk about.
[01:21:47] It is the reluctant fighter.
[01:21:51] Impheld by emotion and not by calculation who tends to press a fight to the better end.
[01:21:58] thereby he too often defeats his own end even if he does not produce his own direct defeat.
[01:22:07] For the spirit of barbarism can be weakened only during a cessation of hostilities.
[01:22:15] For strengthens it pouring fuel on the flames.
[01:22:23] So by attacking people by attacking the barbarians and we attack them we make them stronger.
[01:22:32] We make them fight harder.
[01:22:37] War makes them stronger.
[01:22:40] Makes them fight, makes them resist, pours fuel on the flames.
[01:22:45] We can only weaken them by backing off a little bit.
[01:22:50] Again, this is not the recruiting poster.
[01:22:52] It's so counterintuitive.
[01:22:54] It's so counterintuitive to the natural reaction of push harder.
[01:22:59] Be more dominant to get the outcome that you want.
[01:23:07] So we're here for the truce.
[01:23:10] We're here for the compromise.
[01:23:13] It's so counterintuitive to what we preach what we want.
[01:23:16] Which is total victory.
[01:23:18] I like total victory.
[01:23:19] That sounds good.
[01:23:20] It's a morage.
[01:23:22] Just never compromise.
[01:23:25] No compromise.
[01:23:27] That's another great inspirational.
[01:23:31] Because there's none that say, hey, it's really good to compromise oftentimes and kind
[01:23:35] of take what you can get and work out a good deal.
[01:23:38] That's fair.
[01:23:39] We're going to get hammered for this.
[01:23:45] Some inspirational meme people are going to be mad at us.
[01:23:49] What's crazy is you can probably open up a disciplinary freedom field manual.
[01:23:54] We'll pull out some stuff like this.
[01:23:56] I got all kinds of stuff in there.
[01:23:58] Getting crazy.
[01:24:01] Right?
[01:24:02] You're going to make me crack it open and start reading.
[01:24:04] No.
[01:24:05] Guilty as charged.
[01:24:07] I'm kind of wanting to.
[01:24:10] Well, the good thing about your book is that it's not.
[01:24:15] It's not like you've done a good job whether it be in the book itself or compromise.
[01:24:22] Page 32, this is when it goes freedom field manual.
[01:24:25] When working with other people in dynamic, oh, this is see this is kind of cool.
[01:24:28] Here's what it says.
[01:24:29] This is just the first thing I opened up to.
[01:24:31] When working with other people and dynamic situations in relationships and deals, a person,
[01:24:35] especially a leader must compromise.
[01:24:39] Finding the common ground between teams, merging different approaches to the same problem,
[01:24:44] bridging personalities with people who might not get along, reaching agreements in courses
[01:24:50] of action, all of these require compromise.
[01:24:54] And in many cases, a failure to compromise is a failure to succeed.
[01:24:58] I guess maybe I'm wrong.
[01:25:00] I mean, maybe I'm wrong about me writing stuff that's inspirational mean crap.
[01:25:07] But those are external compromises with other people, other humans that have their own personalities
[01:25:12] and ethos and issues and compromises needed to unify.
[01:25:16] So work with them, compromise.
[01:25:19] So to work with them, compromise is a must.
[01:25:23] Now with yourself.
[01:25:24] And then I wait.
[01:25:25] But internally, it's different.
[01:25:26] With myself, I have to hold the line.
[01:25:28] There are areas within myself where I cannot compromise.
[01:25:31] I'm going to work hard.
[01:25:32] I'm going to train hard.
[01:25:33] I'm going to improve myself.
[01:25:34] I'm not going to rest on my laurels.
[01:25:36] I'm going to confront my own mistakes.
[01:25:39] I'm going to own my mistakes and confront them.
[01:25:41] I'm going to face my demons.
[01:25:43] I'm not going to give up or give out or give in.
[01:25:45] I'm going to stand.
[01:25:47] I'm going to maintain myself discipline.
[01:25:49] And on those points, there will be no compromise, not now, not ever.
[01:25:54] Whoa.
[01:25:55] That's pretty ins pretty pretty.
[01:25:57] We might go meme on that one.
[01:26:00] Sure.
[01:26:01] Yeah, if you go from the headline to the conclusion there and skip the content of the
[01:26:04] middle where it says compromise, not now, not ever.
[01:26:07] You got a little cross with an issue here where you're deciding.
[01:26:10] I was like, I didn't quite read the context.
[01:26:13] But I saw the page that said compromise ended.
[01:26:15] It said not now, not ever.
[01:26:18] Yeah.
[01:26:19] So I think if we go through this book, here's one called fight.
[01:26:23] Go down swinging.
[01:26:24] And I'll tell you, if you fight with all you have more often than not, you won't
[01:26:27] go down at all.
[01:26:28] You will win.
[01:26:31] But you have to make that attitude part of your everyday life.
[01:26:34] Do the extra repetition, run the extra mile, go the extra round, make the right choices,
[01:26:38] give the full measure.
[01:26:40] I'm in the game.
[01:26:43] I think I'm in the inspirational meme game.
[01:26:45] Yeah, you are, but what I was going to say is like, yeah, you do that.
[01:26:49] But the good thing about having a whole book and a whole podcast and eight million other
[01:26:55] books is, or whatever, you're going to explain the whole situation rather than just have
[01:27:00] the one post.
[01:27:01] You see what I'm saying?
[01:27:02] Yeah.
[01:27:03] I mean, look, the entire book is predicate.
[01:27:04] I think the opening salvo you have is, this is about you.
[01:27:09] And you say, I am nothing but weakness.
[01:27:11] I am nothing but but flaws.
[01:27:12] I am nothing but these things.
[01:27:13] So this is the, this is what you are with yourself, with self discipline, as opposed
[01:27:20] to how I'm going to treat other people around me.
[01:27:25] Yes, this is aimed internally.
[01:27:27] Totally.
[01:27:28] I mean, in a literal sense, and that fight is against, I mean, it's even in the video
[01:27:34] that we show it at the most, I am nothing but weakness.
[01:27:37] And I'm going to fight against that weakness, that compromise, all those things that
[01:27:42] might mind me, that's telling me to do to myself, which is, I think also you could look
[01:27:47] in the terms like the difference between imposed discipline and self discipline.
[01:27:51] Imposed discipline does not work and self discipline does.
[01:27:55] That's simple as that.
[01:27:57] And as we impose ourselves on other people, in war, in leadership, in parenting, in insert
[01:28:04] any human interaction, human and another human, when you impose your discipline, when
[01:28:08] you impose yourself on them, in the end you will lose.
[01:28:14] But it's much more efficient just to impose your way.
[01:28:16] Yes, faster.
[01:28:17] Oh, man.
[01:28:20] So there we go.
[01:28:21] That's what we're going to cover for this book.
[01:28:23] That I've kind of, I guess, foreshadowed some of the other things we're doing in the future.
[01:28:27] And it's one of those things.
[01:28:31] If you can take these lessons, these lessons written in blood, not just in one more, but
[01:28:38] in war after war, after war, and the exclamation point of World War I, you can learn
[01:28:46] a lot and you can apply this and we know that it's not as striking, we know it's not as sexy,
[01:28:54] we know it's not as mean worthy as some of the more direct approaches.
[01:29:07] We know that.
[01:29:09] But this is to give the original name, this is how to win wars.
[01:29:18] With that speaking of winning wars, echo Charles, we want to win the war on ourselves.
[01:29:27] We do.
[01:29:28] Yeah, that when you say win wars, when wars, you don't tend to, this is one of the
[01:29:35] takeaways that I think, hey dang, that's something good to remember.
[01:29:40] When you think about war fair and winning the war, you don't think about the peace that
[01:29:44] afterwards, like the aftermath.
[01:29:46] So I grew up on quiet.
[01:29:49] So the thing about quiet is like, if you get in a fight with someone and you don't resolve
[01:29:54] it in a peaceful way, I don't care how.
[01:29:56] I don't care if it's kind of, hey, we don't like each other for no good reason and we just
[01:29:59] fight him, okay, we're cool, we fought and we're done.
[01:30:02] If you don't resolve it in some peaceful way, you got to deal with somebody's cousin.
[01:30:05] Somebody's brother, somebody's whoever, neighbor who's just down for the cause or whatever
[01:30:10] and you're gonna see him again too.
[01:30:12] That's the thing.
[01:30:13] You go to the store, he's gonna be there next week or whatever.
[01:30:17] So it's kind of one of those things where it's kind of in the back of your mind.
[01:30:19] If I'm gonna fight this guy, I sort of got to deal with that content with that long,
[01:30:23] that long game.
[01:30:24] Is there a methodology to get that resolved post fight?
[01:30:28] Yeah, I think so.
[01:30:30] I've, all the fights I've ever been in have never been like lasting, like it'd be like
[01:30:36] a fight and then we're friends afterwards.
[01:30:39] But I was a kid, so I had very little understanding of that.
[01:30:44] But nonetheless, the point is where that's something that when we think of warfare, we think
[01:30:48] of, oh, defeat, cross your enemies, having driven before you.
[01:30:52] You seem to say.
[01:30:53] And we don't think about that all the way.
[01:30:55] And you got your neighbor, his freaking dog or whatever, his barking, his tree is growing
[01:31:00] over your fence and you're gonna, you guys are wearing yours.
[01:31:02] It's like, right, you want to do that.
[01:31:04] You know, you got to live next to that guy.
[01:31:06] When you go to the post office or whatever, you go to your car and you see him getting
[01:31:09] his car too, you're like, oh, it's all awkward or whatever.
[01:31:12] Like, right, you don't have to do it like that, you know?
[01:31:14] Are you really going to achieve the peace that you hoped for by beating this dude's ass
[01:31:19] right now?
[01:31:20] Yeah, well, just chances are you're not really, if you think a little bit, chances are you're
[01:31:25] not thinking, hey, I'm gonna go to the distance right now.
[01:31:27] Like, I'm ready to just go, I'm ready to go all in.
[01:31:30] I'll fight every cousin, nephew, brother, sister.
[01:31:34] I don't care.
[01:31:35] Like, but that's where you can end up.
[01:31:37] Yeah, we want.
[01:31:38] We don't want to end up.
[01:31:39] In fact, that's a common thing, especially like with the neighbors or whatever, I'm
[01:31:42] going to tell him all, it's usually that kind of, I'm going to tell him off.
[01:31:45] I'm not going to take that from him or her, whatever.
[01:31:47] And meanwhile, 10, 20, 30 years you're wearing what this neighbor, right next door by the
[01:31:52] way.
[01:31:53] The feud.
[01:31:54] The feud.
[01:31:55] And then this little, total common thing, you know, when all you got to do is be like,
[01:31:59] hey, make a peaceful discourse.
[01:32:03] And you guys can live neighborly, you seem to say, preferable.
[01:32:08] But anyway, yeah, so the point is, like, thinking about that after math or considering
[01:32:12] that, it's a thing, you know.
[01:32:13] Let's do that.
[01:32:15] Like, if you were always someone in your jitter and you'd fight dirty because you want
[01:32:18] to win.
[01:32:19] And you know, do that stuff then when you're done rolling, you tap them out, hell, yeah.
[01:32:22] Everyone's talking about you.
[01:32:23] You dirty, nobody respects you.
[01:32:25] what he likes, even the community.
[01:32:27] Truth.
[01:32:28] You've got to be careful with that.
[01:32:29] I can still.
[01:32:31] All right.
[01:32:32] So how can we win the war that we're all fighting
[01:32:37] kind of on an individual basis day to day?
[01:32:40] With unmitigated daily discipline in all day.
[01:32:44] I like it.
[01:32:45] I like it.
[01:32:46] So when I say daily discipline,
[01:32:47] I mean the energy drink, boom.
[01:32:49] So it's healthy for you.
[01:32:51] And it gives you the payoff that you
[01:32:53] would expect from an energy drink.
[01:32:56] Same same, so this is good news for us.
[01:32:58] Anyway, so on this path that we're all on,
[01:33:00] we need some supplementation.
[01:33:01] We could benefit from supplementation.
[01:33:04] So we got Choco Fuel to the rescue in a sense.
[01:33:08] It's got energy drinks for you healthy.
[01:33:10] Good short term and long term.
[01:33:12] We got protein, additional protein.
[01:33:14] Taste real good.
[01:33:15] We got dessert, basically.
[01:33:17] dessert.
[01:33:17] That's good for you.
[01:33:18] Yeah, good short term, good long term.
[01:33:20] The aftermath of the bulk of the protein, the dessert.
[01:33:24] It's good out from that.
[01:33:25] That's a peaceful truth.
[01:33:27] It's a peaceful truth.
[01:33:29] Yes, sir.
[01:33:30] Also, when you drink sacked up, when you immunity acts up,
[01:33:34] we got some stuff for that as well.
[01:33:35] How about you don't let your joints act up?
[01:33:37] How about we get into a continual state of peace
[01:33:39] with our joints?
[01:33:40] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:33:40] That's what I think.
[01:33:41] That's what I think.
[01:33:42] Because to wait, wait for your joints to act up as a bad call.
[01:33:46] And I was about to say, preemptive strike on your joints.
[01:33:48] Yeah.
[01:33:49] Yeah, I mean, you're like, hey, but a cooperative, you know,
[01:33:51] you're going down like the right path there.
[01:33:54] I'm like preemptive strike.
[01:33:55] Yeah, you see you're joining more for tune with the hang on.
[01:33:58] Marine Corps recording for poster out of the state.
[01:34:00] It is called joint warfare.
[01:34:02] I mean, it's called joint warfare.
[01:34:03] No, but preemptive strike on joint issues.
[01:34:08] So in issues, yeah, you have to beat them down.
[01:34:09] Demand this submission.
[01:34:10] Yes.
[01:34:11] Be inflammation and to submission with joint warfare.
[01:34:16] Don't wait until you have joint issues that's a dumb call.
[01:34:20] That's what echo Charles just told you to do.
[01:34:23] I'm here to help.
[01:34:25] You know, I'm saying, hey, if you don't want to worry about joint issues,
[01:34:29] you take the joint warfare and the super-cruit oil.
[01:34:31] Yes.
[01:34:32] That's it.
[01:34:33] If you don't want to worry about colds or sicknesses or fluees or whatever,
[01:34:38] you take the vitamin D3.
[01:34:39] You take the cold war.
[01:34:40] That's going to help you.
[01:34:41] Yeah.
[01:34:42] Preemptive strike.
[01:34:43] Preemptive strike.
[01:34:44] Go to war.
[01:34:45] Yeah.
[01:34:46] Fully.
[01:34:47] So you can get all the stuff at vitamin Chum.
[01:34:50] You can get all the energy drinks at Wawa and you can get all of everything on Jocca
[01:34:55] Fuel.com.
[01:34:58] And if you look, if you want to save a little bit of money and you want to save brain
[01:35:02] power, get a subscription.
[01:35:05] Get a subscription to whatever you want.
[01:35:07] It'll show up at your house once a month.
[01:35:09] Boom, there's the milk, there's the joint warfare, there's the super-cruit oil.
[01:35:13] It's coming in.
[01:35:14] When you're worried about it, you can focus on something else.
[01:35:16] You can prioritize next to you some other tasks.
[01:35:19] Yep.
[01:35:20] Speaking of brain power, origin USA.
[01:35:22] They got some American-made stuff.
[01:35:24] How's that enough to do with brain power?
[01:35:25] Right.
[01:35:26] You know what I'm talking about?
[01:35:27] Don't act like you don't know.
[01:35:28] American-American-made denim is for as jeans go.
[01:35:31] I was going to call you in a couple of those last-pond cast where you know, speaking
[01:35:35] of whatever.
[01:35:36] I'm going to talk about something totally different.
[01:35:37] That's sort of like become your new mode.
[01:35:39] No, yeah, because you got to make the association.
[01:35:41] Same thing.
[01:35:42] Speaking of pickles.
[01:35:43] That's the brain power.
[01:35:44] Origin USA.
[01:35:45] You can get some jeans.
[01:35:48] American-made denim.
[01:35:50] That's a big deal.
[01:35:51] As far as American-made stuff goes, you got the denim, you got your jeans, you got your
[01:35:55] geese rash guards, you got athletic wear, you got belts, you got boots, all made in America
[01:36:01] or a gen USA.
[01:36:02] Boom.
[01:36:03] See?
[01:36:04] See what I'm saying about the brain power?
[01:36:06] Yeah, that was definitely had a lot to do with brain power.
[01:36:09] Also speaking of a lot of brain power, you're expended.
[01:36:13] Making that connection.
[01:36:14] Speaking of ridiculous.
[01:36:15] Speaking of ridiculous, Joko has a store.
[01:36:19] Half a watt.
[01:36:20] It's called Joko Store.
[01:36:23] If you want your discipline equals freedom, shirts.
[01:36:26] Right.
[01:36:27] Merch.
[01:36:28] As far as merch goes.
[01:36:29] You're sure this does good on it.
[01:36:31] Boom, you can get it there.
[01:36:32] You can get all kinds of stuff.
[01:36:33] Uh, hats.
[01:36:34] Sure.
[01:36:35] So that's pretty good.
[01:36:36] These are the cards.
[01:36:37] Still, so the shirt was your heart on it.
[01:36:39] Do you still sell the shirt with your head on it?
[01:36:41] You design that shirt.
[01:36:42] Just still sell that shirt with your head on it.
[01:36:44] Yeah, we still sell it.
[01:36:46] Cool.
[01:36:47] Best seller.
[01:36:48] Really?
[01:36:49] Yes.
[01:36:50] It sells double the amount of the one with your head on it.
[01:36:54] If you must.
[01:36:55] No.
[01:36:56] Nonetheless, yes, the shirt that Joko designed with my head is on it on there.
[01:37:01] Bang.
[01:37:02] A bunch of other stuff on there as well.
[01:37:03] We have a subscription situation for the shirt.
[01:37:05] Some other shirts.
[01:37:06] They're exclusive.
[01:37:07] I said it.
[01:37:08] Exclusive.
[01:37:09] Okay.
[01:37:10] It's called the shirt locker.
[01:37:11] You have, you get one of these shirts every month.
[01:37:13] It's a new, they're new, kind of creative for lack of a better term.
[01:37:17] Designs.
[01:37:19] If you're not part of the shirt locker, you don't get them.
[01:37:21] Sorry.
[01:37:22] It's like the nature of the locker.
[01:37:23] You see?
[01:37:24] Okay.
[01:37:25] You in a little more simple this time, which was good.
[01:37:27] I appreciate it this simplicity of it.
[01:37:30] You still can't describe what the shirts are with any, with any sensible.
[01:37:35] Yeah.
[01:37:36] Well, some things can't be explained.
[01:37:39] That's even better.
[01:37:40] That's even better.
[01:37:41] I like that.
[01:37:42] Yeah.
[01:37:43] Even to say, look, I can't really explain this, but trust me, you're going to want one
[01:37:46] of these shirts.
[01:37:47] Okay.
[01:37:48] These shirts cannot be explained Joko.
[01:37:49] They can only be experienced.
[01:37:51] Bang.
[01:37:52] So you make this choice whether or not you experience it by you wearing them or by
[01:37:57] you seeing someone else wearing them.
[01:37:58] That's up to you.
[01:37:59] That part is up to you.
[01:38:00] It's so low.
[01:38:01] Yeah.
[01:38:02] Thank you for either regret what you have done or what you have not done.
[01:38:06] Yeah.
[01:38:07] I think so too.
[01:38:10] You see somebody representing in a shirt.
[01:38:12] We like, well, that's cool.
[01:38:13] I'm going to pick one of those up, but you can't.
[01:38:14] It's true.
[01:38:15] Yeah.
[01:38:16] That's what the field is telling me is for his feet that goes.
[01:38:17] So yeah, I did.
[01:38:18] They're fueled.
[01:38:19] They're fueled.
[01:38:20] They're fueled.

[01:39:00] So anyways, we got this podcast.
[01:39:02] We got the Joko on Ravling podcast with DC, Dero Cooper of Marter Made Fame.
[01:39:09] We got the grounded podcast.
[01:39:10] We got the Warrior Kid podcast.
[01:39:12] We also have Joko underground where we have a sovereign location, a virtual sovereign
[01:39:20] location where we will not be impeded upon by forces.
[01:39:28] So we will do what we want in the Joko underground look.
[01:39:32] Hey, here's what's going on in the world.
[01:39:34] There's things happening on these platforms.
[01:39:37] There's things happening in these platforms.
[01:39:38] We don't control the platforms.
[01:39:40] We don't control the platforms.
[01:39:41] There's a possibility that things could happen that could hurt what we're trying to
[01:39:46] do.
[01:39:47] Whether they start charging you money to listen on these platforms.
[01:39:52] Whether they start inserting advertisements into the middle of us talking about World
[01:39:57] War I or Vietnam and all of a sudden you're listening to an advertisement about what
[01:40:04] that's what it is.
[01:40:05] Mattresses.
[01:40:06] We don't want to have that happen.
[01:40:09] We definitely don't want to be censored for whatever reason.
[01:40:14] So we got to have an alternative platform.
[01:40:16] We made our own Joko underground.com.
[01:40:20] Look, we hopefully we never have to go to it.
[01:40:22] It's possible.

[01:40:58] We got a YouTube channel speaking of smashing the subscribe button.
[01:41:03] And free.

[01:41:08] Subscribe.
[01:41:09] Subscribe like and comment.
[01:41:10] Yeah.
[01:41:11] Wouldn't it be annoying if the, like every video, that's what somebody's got to put
[01:41:16] in the front of it.
[01:41:17] Like and subscribe, that's what it is.
[01:41:19] And hit the notification comment too.
[01:41:21] No, they say comment.
[01:41:22] Oh yeah, and it plus hit the notification.
[01:41:23] What are you doing, dude?
[01:41:24] Let me know in the comments.
[01:41:26] Yeah, let me know in the comments.
[01:41:27] They always have some dumb thing to talk about.
[01:41:29] Yes, you know.
[01:41:30] Most of it.
[01:41:31] Yeah, you know what I was thinking.
[01:41:32] I was, if you want to see more videos like this could make, let me know in the comments.
[01:41:35] Shut up, bro.
[01:41:36] We talked about.
[01:41:37] You know what?
[01:41:38] You're, we'll just say, I'm not going to say your salty.
[01:41:42] I'm not going to say that.
[01:41:43] I'm a pernalist.
[01:41:44] Your salty, but that's not what I'm saying.
[01:41:46] The reason that you feel what I think that you're feeling right now about that is because
[01:41:51] it's like, it's super obvious.
[01:41:55] Like what they're doing, they want to like, they want the intel for the algorithm, right?
[01:41:59] The more you want the engagement, right?
[01:42:01] Obviously, they want the comments, they want the likes.
[01:42:03] They want the, because that's for the algorithm so they can rate their video higher.
[01:42:06] So they can, and you, we know that.
[01:42:08] We know that.
[01:42:09] We're not even mad at that.
[01:42:10] Really kind of mad at that.
[01:42:11] But they're known, but I think we, or you are mad, quote unquote, at the part where
[01:42:15] they try to fake like that's not it.
[01:42:18] They try to fake like, oh yeah, you let me know all it.
[01:42:20] You know, you, you know, we're just going to be each other.
[01:42:23] We're friends almost kind of a feeling and you're like, you don't want to know what I think,
[01:42:28] you know, that's what it feels like.
[01:42:30] I can't read the guys mind.
[01:42:31] So I don't know if you really want to know or not, but that's how it feels.
[01:42:33] That's why I feel it too.
[01:42:35] Well, I'm, I don't say in the videos like comment, but I read the comments because
[01:42:42] they're funny.
[01:42:43] They're funny.
[01:42:44] And they're good.
[01:42:45] And some of them aren't interesting.
[01:42:46] Yeah.
[01:42:47] Some good tips on books to cover and stuff from YouTube comments.
[01:42:51] Literally, that's kind of crazy, right?
[01:42:53] Yeah.
[01:42:54] So I'll read the comments because they're interesting.
[01:42:56] They're funny.
[01:42:58] Yeah, YouTube comments kind of have a reputation on that kind of straight up YouTube comments
[01:43:04] have the rep, the stigma of being like a cesspool of just like unreasonable negativity.
[01:43:11] But I think usually with our stuff, they can be constructive most of the time.
[01:43:16] I'm down.
[01:43:17] So if you want to leave a comment, leave a comment, like subscribe smash.
[01:43:22] Anyway, yes, the point is we do have YouTube channel.
[01:43:27] So if you want to look at that, but there you go.
[01:43:29] Also, psychological warfare is an album that Jockel did.
[01:43:31] I recorded back in the day for the purpose of the other.
[01:43:35] Yeah, very hard.
[01:43:37] No, man, it was helpful.
[01:43:38] It was a very, literally press record.
[01:43:41] Right.
[01:43:42] That's what recording is.
[01:43:43] You press record on the thing.
[01:43:44] You think everybody's like super pumped on that?
[01:43:47] I think they're very impressed.
[01:43:48] Yeah.
[01:43:49] Nonetheless, okay, the for you was recorded for the purpose of helping me through my moments
[01:43:53] of weakness.
[01:43:54] Then we added some other stuff about weaknesses that I don't have, but that other people
[01:43:58] might have, which turned out to be the case.
[01:44:01] So yeah, if you have some moments of weakness, you're listening to Jockel telling you how
[01:44:04] to get over on bones, psychological warfare.
[01:44:08] If you want to see a visual representation of how to stay on the path, go to flipsidecampus.com,

[01:48:21] Bonaparte, remember that he pursued his vision a piece for 20 years of war and ended
[01:48:31] up defeated and in exile.
[01:48:35] Don't do that.
[01:48:38] Don't do that.
[01:48:40] Think strategic.
[01:48:44] Just your ends to your means.
[01:48:47] Make sure you can actually win.
[01:48:51] Make sure you can see that pathway to victory.
[01:48:55] Make sure you can see those pathways plural to victory and then start down that path.
[01:49:02] And then give it everything you got.
[01:49:06] Until next time, this is Dave and Echo and Jockel.
[01:49:10] Ow.
