[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 136.
[00:00:05] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:08] Good evening, I go. Good evening.
[00:00:18] Who are these?
[00:00:22] Why sit? They hear in Twilight.
[00:00:27] Wherefore rock they, pergatorial shadows,
[00:00:33] drooping tongues from jaws that slob their relish,
[00:00:38] bearing teeth that lear like skulls teeth wicked.
[00:00:47] Stroke on stroke of pain.
[00:00:51] But what slow panic gouged these chasms
[00:00:56] round their fredded sockets,
[00:01:02] ever from their hair,
[00:01:04] and through their hands, palms, misery, swelters.
[00:01:12] Surely we have perished,
[00:01:15] sleeping and walk in hell,
[00:01:18] but who these hellish.
[00:01:27] These are men,
[00:01:29] whose minds the dead have ravished.
[00:01:35] Memory, fingers in their hair of mergers,
[00:01:39] multitudinous mergers, they once witnessed.
[00:01:43] Waiting slew of flesh,
[00:01:48] these helpless wander,
[00:01:51] treading blood from lungs that had loved laughter.
[00:02:00] Always they must see these things,
[00:02:03] and hear them,
[00:02:04] batter of guns,
[00:02:05] and shatter of flying muscles,
[00:02:07] carnage incomparible,
[00:02:09] and human squander, rocks to thick,
[00:02:13] for these men's extrication.
[00:02:22] Therefore, still,
[00:02:24] their eyeball shrink tormented back into their brains.
[00:02:31] Because on their sense,
[00:02:33] sunlight seems a blood smear.
[00:02:36] The sun comes blood black,
[00:02:39] dawn breaks open like a wound
[00:02:41] that bleeds a fresh.
[00:02:48] Thus, their heads,
[00:02:50] where this hilarious,
[00:02:53] hideous, awful falseness of set smiling corpses.
[00:03:01] Thus, their hands are plucking at each other,
[00:03:04] and the eyes of their scurging.
[00:03:12] Snatching after us, who smoke them,
[00:03:16] brother,
[00:03:18] calling us,
[00:03:21] who dealt them war,
[00:03:24] died before again.
[00:03:38] And that is a poem.
[00:03:40] It's a poem
[00:03:42] called Mental Kaces.
[00:03:47] And it's a poem that was written
[00:03:49] by Wilford Owen.
[00:03:51] He wrote it in 1918.
[00:03:54] He was a British poet, but he was also a British soldier.
[00:04:03] He was wounded in the first world war.
[00:04:06] He was blown up by a trench mortar.
[00:04:10] Then he spent several days unconscious lying with the shredded remains of one of his fellow
[00:04:15] officers.
[00:04:18] With those wounds, he was also diagnosed with shell shock.
[00:04:26] He was sent to a place called Craig Lockhart Hospital, which is where they sent these
[00:04:35] soldiers to be treated.
[00:04:39] There he recovered to some extent, and then he went back to the front.
[00:04:50] And on October 1st in 1918, he led a unit from the second manchesters as they assaulted
[00:04:58] enemy positions in John Court.
[00:05:03] He was awarded the military cross for that action.
[00:05:13] And on the 4th of November 1918, seven days prior to November 11th, which was the end
[00:05:24] of the war, Wilfredo was killed in action.
[00:05:28] He was shot by a German machine gunner.
[00:05:39] And that poem is obviously about the psychological damage that he saw when he was in Craig
[00:05:46] Lockhart recovering from shell shock.
[00:05:49] And I've talked about World War I on this podcast before, and I've talked about the
[00:05:55] shell shock.
[00:05:57] And if you go to YouTube and you Google World War I shell shock, and you watch some of the
[00:06:03] videos you can see, the horror of the shell shock, which reflects the horror of the war itself.
[00:06:12] The trenches, the wounds, the gas, the death, the madness of the thousands and thousands and
[00:06:19] thousands and thousands of deaths over and over and over again.
[00:06:25] And that poem, mental cases, it reflects the nightmare of the shell shock inside the nightmare
[00:06:44] of this war.
[00:06:49] And I wanted to hear a little bit about what shell shock looked like from the outside.
[00:06:57] And I found an article called Shell Shock revisited an examination of the case records of
[00:07:03] the National Hospital London by Stephanie Lyndon and Edgar Jones.
[00:07:10] And that's good excerpts coming directly from doctors, nurses that worked in these wards.
[00:07:20] And here's one, this is a case from the case of a 27-year-old rifleman known as Frank D,
[00:07:26] who's diagnosed with functional tremor and neurosis like dog Korea.
[00:07:33] And if you don't know what that is, it's a disease that gives dogs seizures and tremors
[00:07:37] and fits.
[00:07:38] And again, go to YouTube, you can see these dogs suffering like that.
[00:07:44] And this is what the doctors wrote about Frank D.
[00:07:47] Patient is a territorial, which is a reservist who served heavily in World War I.
[00:07:52] Patient is a territorial and went out to France in January.
[00:07:56] He has been quite well up to a week ago.
[00:08:00] Went on April 26.
[00:08:01] He was buried under a bomb explosion in the trench.
[00:08:04] He was not unconscious but dazed and all in a tremble.
[00:08:09] All his limbs were shaking.
[00:08:12] He was conscious being carried by his comrades out of the trenches to a dugout a few hours
[00:08:16] afterwards.
[00:08:18] He had to cry and he was crying for two days.
[00:08:23] At the same time, his arms began to twitch very frequently at first.
[00:08:29] He was transferred to the 12th General Hospital and from there to here.
[00:08:40] Another case, another entry about a 23 year old Scottish private known as Henry M.
[00:08:48] from the 18th who SARS, who was diagnosed with functional facial spasm.
[00:08:57] On May 13, and this is 1915, patient was struck by several pieces of shrapnel on the right
[00:09:03] hand forearm shoulder and on the right side of the nose at its base.
[00:09:07] He was very dazed but did not lose consciousness.
[00:09:11] The wounds healed in a month.
[00:09:13] About a week after being wounded, he was operated on and ordered that a piece of shrapnel
[00:09:17] might be removed from his face.
[00:09:19] On recovering from the anesthesia, he found himself unable to move the right side of
[00:09:23] his face or open his mouth.
[00:09:27] This condition which is quite painless has persisted since and he is not eaten solid food
[00:09:32] or been able to take out his false teeth.
[00:09:34] He has been fed through a rubber tube inserted between his teeth.
[00:09:39] And all other respects he feels well, patient sits up in bed gasping in a highly alarming
[00:09:43] manner.
[00:09:45] With his left face in a strong, tonic spasm and his jaws tightly set, all efforts to open
[00:09:51] his mouth are unavailing.
[00:09:53] So strong is the contraction of his massators.
[00:09:58] He declares himself unable to breathe unless sitting up and when made to lie down, his neck
[00:10:03] is strongly retracted and set and he breathes up violently through his clenched teeth and
[00:10:08] holds his breath for as long as he can, assuming a purple tinge which is apt to be
[00:10:13] disconcerting until one is accustomed to it.
[00:10:18] By the moral aid given by strong ferodysm which is an electric current applied by the
[00:10:25] physician and forced applied to the jaw, it was possible to remove a filthy set of false
[00:10:31] teeth.
[00:10:35] During this performance, he uttered piercing shrieks and foamed and his rigidly held arms
[00:10:41] shook violently.
[00:10:43] Tears ran from his eyes and he swed it profusely from his muscular exertion and resisting
[00:10:48] the attentions well-intended though they were of the physician.
[00:10:55] When asked to close his eyes, he was able to do.
[00:10:59] In fact, the left eye is half closed in spasm.
[00:11:02] All test reveal good power in both sides of the face.
[00:11:06] The facial and jaw spasm would seem to be voluntary and due to frank malingering.
[00:11:13] In the intervals of this grotesque performance, he lies back on the pillow without any
[00:11:19] dysponia but he induces an apparent difficulty in breathing it will.
[00:11:27] Examinations reveal no organic or injury in either nervous or other systems.
[00:11:38] So just to recap, they're stating that the facial and jaw spasms would seem to be from
[00:11:46] voluntary and malingering, basically saying that he's doing this so that he can avoid the
[00:11:53] war.
[00:12:00] Here's another different type of symptom of shell shock.
[00:12:05] This is a 23-year-old private named Albert R.
[00:12:09] And it's reported that he had marked twitching of the face and the whole body at times
[00:12:13] trembles.
[00:12:14] He looks ill and regurgitates wind.
[00:12:18] He complains of a peculiar feeling of worms growing in the lower part of the abdomen.
[00:12:23] He coughs considerably and said that his stomach swells up.
[00:12:26] Alump appears in his throat which chokes him.
[00:12:31] And he is continually expecting.
[00:12:34] The nights are particularly hard on him.
[00:12:37] He sits up in bed and has great difficulty breathing.
[00:12:40] Cannot lie down properly but lies over to one side, either left or right.
[00:12:44] Quits his hand up to hold his head still from shaking.
[00:12:51] He has a depressed and solemn look.
[00:12:55] There are involuntary movements characterized by a very fine tremor manifested when his hands
[00:13:00] are spread out and his fingers are separated.
[00:13:04] There's a slight tremor and his legs of the same nature as it appears in the other part
[00:13:09] of the body.
[00:13:15] So those are some examples of this horrible affliction of shell shock.
[00:13:24] And as you noticed in some of these in that one right up in particular, there was people
[00:13:30] that were saying, they're just faking this.
[00:13:34] They could overcome this if they would be braver.
[00:13:39] Some people did recognize that this was a serious issue and that this was a new kind
[00:13:42] of wound and a new kind of war in November of 1914.
[00:13:47] So this is pretty early on November 1914.
[00:13:51] Lord Nutsford, chairman of the London Hospital House Committee, wrote an appeal that was
[00:13:57] published in London newspapers and here's what he wrote.
[00:14:01] There are certain number of our gallant soldiers for whom no proper provision is at present
[00:14:07] obtainable but is sorely needed.
[00:14:11] They are suffering from very severe mental and nervous shock due to exposure, excessive
[00:14:16] strain and tension.
[00:14:20] They can be cured if only they receive proper attention from the physicians who have made
[00:14:24] a specialty of treating such conditions.
[00:14:27] These men are quite unsuitable patients for general hospitals as their chance of recovery
[00:14:32] depends on absolute quiet and on the individual and prolonged attention of the physician.
[00:14:40] If not cured, these men will drift back to the world as wrecks and miserable wrecks
[00:14:46] for the rest of their lives.
[00:14:50] So there were some people that recognized this was a factor that went well beyond the bravery
[00:14:56] of the individual.
[00:14:59] But unfortunately that was probably less percentage of people.
[00:15:05] Most people thought that these individuals that suffered this affliction of shell shock,
[00:15:14] thought that they were just, they weren't brave.
[00:15:18] And we've talked about it with a bunch of podcasts, Dick Winner's talks about it, hack
[00:15:26] worth talks about it that there's a cup that gets filled and it gets filled too much.
[00:15:30] People can't take anymore.
[00:15:31] It's not because they're not good people.
[00:15:34] It's not because they aren't brave or they weren't brave.
[00:15:36] It's because they're done.
[00:15:38] They're done.
[00:15:39] And there's ways you can treat them.
[00:15:40] We've talked about it before.
[00:15:41] You see a guy that looks like he's going to be done.
[00:15:44] You need to get him rest.
[00:15:45] And if they get rest, they can recover.
[00:15:46] If they don't get rest and they just continually put into it, you're going to burn that
[00:15:50] engine out.
[00:15:51] You're going to burn out their brain.
[00:15:53] Well, they didn't quite understand that yet.
[00:15:59] And again, this type of warfare was totally new.
[00:16:03] There wasn't this kind of just continual slaughter ever before.
[00:16:10] And if it was, it was like an incident.
[00:16:11] Oh, there was a huge battle and there were a bunch of people killed.
[00:16:13] It wasn't like we're going to go do that again tomorrow.
[00:16:15] Well, guess what?
[00:16:16] These guys were going to go and do that same thing tomorrow and the next day and the
[00:16:20] day after that.
[00:16:24] So I want to talk about something that is as horrible as World War I was.
[00:16:34] This might be the most horrible part of World War I.
[00:16:41] And I know that's a bold statement.
[00:16:43] But I want to start by telling you the story of one individual soldier.
[00:16:47] His name was Harry Far.
[00:16:51] And I'm going to go to a book about his life.
[00:16:56] The book is called He Was No Coward.
[00:16:59] It was written by Janet Booth and James White.
[00:17:06] And it tells the story of Harry Far, the Harry Far story.
[00:17:11] Now it starts off by giving a little background on Harry Far and he grew up young man.
[00:17:18] And it kind of starts off with him meeting who he would eventually marry, a woman by the
[00:17:23] name of Gertrude.
[00:17:25] And we'll go to the book, Gertrude and Harry started walking out together.
[00:17:30] They both loved visiting the Gady Theater.
[00:17:34] And many happy evening was spent at the Hammer Smith Empire watching The Variety
[00:17:39] Showers. The pair soon became girlfriend and boyfriend.
[00:17:42] And for the next four years they became inseparable.
[00:17:44] But not without some bumps in the roads.
[00:17:47] At the age of 20, Harry was four years Gertrude's senior.
[00:17:51] Something her family was not happy about.
[00:17:54] But what did she say?
[00:17:55] She said, I love him.
[00:17:55] I'm going with him.
[00:17:57] And that's that.
[00:18:00] So they're young.
[00:18:02] They're in love.
[00:18:04] And Harry was earning good money working as a scaffolder on the building
[00:18:08] sites across London.
[00:18:11] And it came as quite a shock in April 1913 when Gertrude realized she was pregnant.
[00:18:18] A child born out of wedlock would bring shame and disgrace on the immediate family,
[00:18:22] going to the pending arrival of the baby.
[00:18:24] They had to bring their wedding forward and were married as soon as possible.
[00:18:28] By the time of the wedding, they had been together for three years.
[00:18:32] And they were married in Kensington Registry office in the summer of 1913.
[00:18:38] The baby, who was to be their only child was born on October 29th of that year, they named
[00:18:43] her Gertrude Nellie, her middle-named after Harry's sisterhood emigrated to America.
[00:18:49] But the new baby would be known affectionately as little Gertie.
[00:18:56] Now prior to meeting Gertie, Harry had, well, I'll go to the book, Harry had chosen
[00:19:06] adventurous path in 1908.
[00:19:08] So this is previous.
[00:19:09] When he had just turned 18, he had decided to join the army.
[00:19:12] He enlisted as a regular soldier in the first battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment
[00:19:18] known as the Prince of Wales' own.
[00:19:23] Little is known of his two years as a regular soldier.
[00:19:27] But later records show, he was considered to be a reliable and trustworthy soldier with
[00:19:33] an exemplary record of good behavior.
[00:19:37] Now this happens in America as well when you're on active duty, which is what he was
[00:19:41] those first two years when you get done with active duty, they put you on some sort of
[00:19:45] reserve status.
[00:19:46] There's, I think it's called IRR.
[00:19:49] And maybe it stands for immediate regular reserve.
[00:19:52] I don't really remember.
[00:19:53] I was on it for some amount of time, but I don't remember.
[00:19:55] And it's basically when you're out, but they can recall you.
[00:19:58] And then you can say active reserve, which is when you're still getting paid, maybe you
[00:20:02] should do some drills and whatnot.
[00:20:03] It sounds like he was in a company.
[00:20:04] When he got out, he was in a combination of those two.
[00:20:07] We'll go to the book.
[00:20:08] Most soldiers who had left the army were automatically placed in the section B reserve,
[00:20:13] it meant that for five years they could be called upon in the event of general mobilization.
[00:20:17] And were paid three shilling and six pence per week as a retainer.
[00:20:21] While also being obliged to undertake periodic training.
[00:20:24] So that's sort of like the reserves.
[00:20:26] I had to throw this in there in a pamphlet entitled a short history of the West Yorkshire
[00:20:31] Regiment, the excitable introduction to the unit nicknamed the old and bold claims.
[00:20:37] No regimen in the British army has a more glorious history than the West Yorkshire Regiment,
[00:20:42] the Prince of Wales own.
[00:20:46] For its record and gallon and devoted service to King and Country, in many parts of the
[00:20:51] empire is equaled by few and surpassed by none.
[00:20:57] So proud history and can probably figure out where this is going.
[00:21:03] The war kicks off, world war one kicks off.
[00:21:07] And he gets recalled to go and serve back to the book.
[00:21:11] He had previously served with the regiments first battalion, but its soldiers were already
[00:21:14] in France when he returned to duty.
[00:21:16] So he joined the second battalion before his passage to France.
[00:21:20] Harry is granted a weekend past allowing him to return to London and spend precious
[00:21:25] last few days with his wife and young child.
[00:21:28] Gertis first birthday was celebrated that weekend and Gertru promised to write her husband
[00:21:34] frequently as well as sending him food and clothing parcels after what must have been an extremely
[00:21:39] difficult farewell.
[00:21:40] Harry returned to camp having slightly overstated his past subsequently being forced
[00:21:45] to forfeit four days pay.
[00:21:51] Like Harry, the majority of his fellow comrades had never boarded a boat before let alone
[00:21:57] left England shores.
[00:21:59] Despite reasonably smooth crossing to France, many of the men suffered from sea sickness,
[00:22:04] those not being sick were in good cheer and eager to face the enemy and battle, the general
[00:22:09] consensus of the men being that by Christmas this bloody war will be over.
[00:22:16] So it turns around pretty quick.
[00:22:19] Even in the book that part turns around pretty quick and obviously I skip some sections
[00:22:23] but we get right into it.
[00:22:26] On November 13th at 11pm the West Yorkshire is relieved the Devin Regiment.
[00:22:30] The very next day the soldiers came under fire for the first time and suffered their
[00:22:33] first casualties with three men wounded.
[00:22:38] Indeed one account of the battalions first taste of trench warfare described the soldiers
[00:22:43] great discomfort in heavy mud.
[00:22:47] At times during this period the trenches occupied by the West Yorkshire Regiment soldiers
[00:22:52] were two to six feet deep in water and cold mud baths were common.
[00:22:59] So also was the inevitable accompaniment of sickness.
[00:23:04] On November 19th the battalion lost its first man to sniper fire with another six wounded.
[00:23:09] Even when the men were resting in the barns and houses allocated behind to them behind
[00:23:13] the lines there was no respite from the shelling.
[00:23:20] Acting sergeant Walter Weston recorded the difficulty of fighting in the rapidly deteriorating
[00:23:25] conditions he wrote the continual rain where the whole terrain had turned into a quagmire
[00:23:30] of liquid mud making it difficult for the transport carrying supplies and weapons to continue
[00:23:36] along the muddy roads.
[00:23:37] Every so often they had to stop and push the vehicles over the Chloe mud.
[00:23:42] One more harrowing was to try to pull comrades out of the mud many perished by slipping
[00:23:48] off the duckboards and disappearing into the slime.
[00:23:52] The day spent in wet and muddy trenches left some soldiers incapacitated by transfer and invariably
[00:24:00] resulted in many of the men having a foot or both feet amputated.
[00:24:08] The pitiful sight of the horses and mules stuck in the rain, soil, struggling to free
[00:24:13] themselves from the mud.
[00:24:16] So yeah we think about trench foot you know think of your feet or uncomfortable or whatever.
[00:24:21] You don't think about having one or both of your feet amputated.
[00:24:27] December 18th the West Yorkshire Regiments Colonel and captains were told that the second
[00:24:31] battalion deven regiment would be attacking the German trench and two companies of Yorkshire
[00:24:35] German would be sent in support to dig and make good any captured trenches.
[00:24:41] The official Battalion Diary records the deven attack commenced from the left and was
[00:24:46] late in starting.
[00:24:48] The right company never advanced thus creating a block in the trenches.
[00:24:51] The left company's attack was unsuccessful owing to the wire arrangements, but the left
[00:24:56] center of company occupied 150 yards of the main German trench.
[00:25:03] The midnight the entire second battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment was ordered to take
[00:25:07] over the captured trench and improve it for defense while their comrades dug in alongside.
[00:25:11] However at 8 a.m., the Germans responded with hand grenades thrown in great quantities and
[00:25:16] very rapidly forcing the men occupying the trench to retreat to the British front line.
[00:25:24] As a consequence of the sub-naction, the company of West Yorkshire soldiers attempting to dig
[00:25:29] on the right were left exposed and suffered withering on filet fire.
[00:25:35] They also retreated and the attack ended in failure and the battalion suffered two officers
[00:25:41] killed, two wounded and 120 other ranks killed or wounded almost all sustained in the retreat.
[00:25:57] The New Year and again advancing through the book and to get the full details get the book
[00:26:05] and read it.
[00:26:07] The New Year of 1915 began as the old one finished for the Yorkshireman cold wet and in
[00:26:12] the trenches.
[00:26:14] January 6 one man was killed and the lieutenant was taken to the hospital.
[00:26:19] Despite the hostile nature of the enemy just a few hundred yards in front of him the
[00:26:22] battalion diary noted that the main cause of casualties was increasingly a result of sickness.
[00:26:35] As well as the ever-present water and mud disease and sickness was carried by living sources
[00:26:42] from the ice that infested every bit of clothing to the rats that feasted on the unburied
[00:26:47] dead.
[00:26:49] All fossil rights the stench of rotten flesh was over everything.
[00:26:55] Hardly replaced by the chloride of lime sprinkled on particularly offensive sights, dead
[00:27:02] horses and dead men and parts of both were sometimes not buried for months and often simply
[00:27:08] became an element of parapids and trench walls.
[00:27:15] You could smell the lime miles before you could see it.
[00:27:23] So if you've never smelled the dead body before it's an absolutely horrible horrible, horrible
[00:27:30] smell and when you think about the places where you're living are actually partially built
[00:27:40] from bodies and parts of bodies it's hard to even imagine what the stench was and how bad
[00:27:48] it was.
[00:27:53] Back to the book one man was killed and another wounded on January 12th on January 19th
[00:27:57] the trenches had dried out slightly and four men were injured in action on January 25th
[00:28:02] rifle fire was recorded as being heavier than usual but ultimately the expected attack
[00:28:07] never came though three men were killed in the course of the day the following day was
[00:28:13] off to the billets in La Flinke this time in the brigade reserve two men were killed
[00:28:22] in one wounded but a draft of 50 men arrived.
[00:28:31] On the last day of the month snow fell with water building in the trenches but the enemy
[00:28:35] was quiet the whole month of January had been spent either in the trenches or in the nearby
[00:28:41] reserve with no time spent any distance away from the guns.
[00:28:49] On February 4th the battalion relieved second battalion four men were killed and five
[00:28:53] were wounded on February 10th the battalion was back in the line losing one man and two wounded
[00:28:59] on February 11th.
[00:29:04] March 6th five men were injured some severely when they hit they were hit by shrapnel
[00:29:08] in the morning two of the five died of their wounds later that day.
[00:29:13] It's weird you think about this it's just pecking away it's just pecking away day after
[00:29:22] day after day after day.
[00:29:26] You got you got 250 guys or something in your company maybe 200 guys in your company
[00:29:33] and it's two here it's three there it's eight wounded there it's four wounded there and
[00:29:37] then you get you get drafts come in which is new fresh guys 50 of them coming in to replace
[00:29:44] the guys that you've lost.
[00:29:49] Officers were issued with a full set of orders on March 9th for the attack on New
[00:29:54] Vais Chappelle.
[00:29:58] March 10th at 7 30 a.m. the bombardment of enemy positions began with wire cutting
[00:30:02] shrapnel to aid any breakthroughs by the infantry the first shell to fall was fired by an
[00:30:09] impressive 15 inch howitzer and weighed an incredible 1400 pounds.
[00:30:16] However their advance was blocked the battalion then withdrew back to British trenches
[00:30:20] and held the line casualties had been severe as they had crossed as they had across the front
[00:30:27] on the murderous first day of the battle 23 members of the battalion were dead 51 men had
[00:30:34] been wounded three were missing but the savage fighting was to continue that for a and the
[00:30:41] next day orders received to move 17 members of the regiment were killed outright 40 men
[00:30:47] and one officer were wounded four men were missing shelling continued inflicting heavy casualties
[00:30:53] on the severely depleted west Yorkshire men as they hurled in the trenches in cold and
[00:30:58] misty conditions.
[00:31:05] By this stage of the attack the infantry soldiers were exhausted dead on their feet would have been
[00:31:12] an accurate description the condition of the gallant fellows who had been fighting and marching
[00:31:16] two and from the trenches since the early hours of the 10th with practically no respite was now pityable.
[00:31:25] Men fell asleep at every halt having to be roused by violent means.
[00:31:34] Among the ranks 14 men were killed 31 wounded six winners missing at 7pm the soldiers moved off
[00:31:42] the occupied line of trenches. Grimley the battalion diarist noted we found this trench unoccupied
[00:31:51] and full of dead. The deaths and injuries continued forward killed 28 wounded three went
[00:32:00] missing during the day November 5th General Hay goes to become the commander and chief of the British
[00:32:07] Expeditionary Force the following year wrote in his diary that why my one thought was how soon
[00:32:16] I could get my battle worn troops relieved and given a few days rest out of the trenches and shell fire.
[00:32:28] On July 30th 1915 he was even more explicit saying one lesson of this war was that troops could stand
[00:32:35] four days hard fighting and then must be relieved.
[00:32:41] So you take that right there you take four days that that's an average from this guy that's seen
[00:32:46] these folks on the front line. So that means there's people that are less than that there's some
[00:32:49] people that are more some people can handle eight days 10 days some people can handle one day some
[00:32:53] people can't handle any the average is four days and here are these guys on the line for 10 20
[00:32:59] 13 17 days at a time and there is times that I'm not mentioning where they're going back off the
[00:33:04] front line and they're getting a little bit of recovery but then they're going right back in and
[00:33:09] it's not four days that they're going into for they're going in for eight days for 12 days.
[00:33:16] Back to the book there was a little action with two men killed in one wounded the
[00:33:20] battalion was relieved by the second battalion Lincoln Regiment and March to Bill it's just a mile away
[00:33:25] from the battleground the second battalion had lost more than a quarter of its strength.
[00:33:37] Marching teeth donned cold and wet and despite the battalion diaris noting that it was quiet
[00:33:45] three men were killed. Quiet day three men were killed. April six the shell exploded
[00:33:54] in a company billet killing three and in during eight. 5 a.m. on May 9th the artillery bombardment
[00:34:02] of the enemy trenches began with the attack launched just 40 minutes later so here we are on another
[00:34:09] attack on another attack. During the shelling and small arms fire from the Germans there were
[00:34:15] three were killed 13 were wounded and three posted is missing. And this results and the French attack
[00:34:27] on Vimi Ridge failed after a week costing the French 100,000 casualties. The British attack on
[00:34:37] Auburn's Ridge which is what they were working on failed ignominiously. So that's the life
[00:34:48] if you can call it that. And here's where we start to hear a little bit about Harry by this time
[00:34:54] Harry had been withdrawn from the front line suffering from what was becoming known as shell shock.
[00:35:00] He was taken off duty on May 9th. However rather than being viewed as a psychological
[00:35:07] condition some doctors and researchers were viewing the symptoms more in line with a neurological
[00:35:12] disorder or the result of a concussion from shell blast treatment for the condition
[00:35:18] largely involved rest away from the front line and possibly some talking therapies that we
[00:35:23] would now refer to as counseling. Some doctors utilize electric shock therapy and isolation
[00:35:29] therapy on sufferers but both were unproven and experimental. There's a doctor Stevenson that says
[00:35:36] post-traumatic stress disorder this is looking back post-traumatic stress disorder was exacerbated
[00:35:42] by the special conditions of static warfare in which soldiers endured repeated bombardments
[00:35:47] in confined spaces with little control over their fate. And live day by day in close proximity
[00:35:55] to their comrades decomposing remains. So I've talked about this before we talked about it when
[00:36:00] Jordan was on Jordan Peterson. When you don't have any control, when you're not on offense,
[00:36:05] it's a lot harder to deal with psychologically and this is the ultimate defensive. You're just
[00:36:10] going to get bombed and there's nothing you can do about it. And by the way, you're going to watch
[00:36:17] your friends and your comrades get wounded and killed every single day. Back to the book.
[00:36:25] In the summer of 1915, Gertrude received a letter from France but she did not recognize the handwriting
[00:36:32] on the envelope as Harry's. So his wife gets a letter, she has recognized the handwriting.
[00:36:39] The letter stated that Harry was ill and in the hospital he had been evacuated
[00:36:45] from the hoop lanes area in May as he had been suffering from what was known as shell shock.
[00:36:52] Stricing by nervous exhaustion, his hands had been shaking too much to hold a pencil so
[00:36:59] a nurse at the hospital had written the letter for him. Again, uncontrollable shaking.
[00:37:12] This is what these guys are experiencing. So bad he can't write his letter, a letter to his wife.
[00:37:16] After the extended period behind the lines, Harry was assessed and certified fit.
[00:37:22] He was sent back to the West Yorkshire Regiment. This time joining the first battalion,
[00:37:27] part of the 18th Infantry Brigade's sixth division in October of 1915.
[00:37:33] On October 21, 89 men including Harry joined the battalion while it was camped behind the line.
[00:37:39] Shortly after, the Germans launched a huge barrage against Allied rest areas along all the
[00:37:46] front in retaliation for royal artillery shelling of their own billets.
[00:37:52] Although little damage was done, the sound of the guns which had caused Harry to fall ill before
[00:38:00] had begun all over again for him. At the end of the month of the battalion began an 11-day
[00:38:08] spell in the trenches characterized by heavy rain, collapsing fortifications and mud by November 3rd
[00:38:14] in officer had been killed and almost all dugouts had collapsed leaving men with little
[00:38:20] respite from the appalling weather. On December 5, the battalion marched to every link,
[00:38:29] spending the next 10 days forming working parties to carry out tasks such as repairing paths,
[00:38:34] despite not being in the line casualties were sustained when the parties were sheld and
[00:38:40] fired upon by riflemen. So even when you go back to the rear, you're still getting shot
[00:38:45] ins killed. December 19th, when the area came under untill the re-bombardment and that frightening
[00:38:51] phenomenon of battle, the use of gas. The action began at 530 a.m. when the British held trenches
[00:39:00] came under heavy rifle fire, then at 645 a.m. when troops were stood to in anticipation for an attack,
[00:39:08] shells containing gas were fired by the Germans.
[00:39:10] The effect the gas was instantaneous and horrifying during the day 11 men died in 23 were wounded
[00:39:19] too sufferingly effects of gas. Total allied losses on the day as a direct result of gas were
[00:39:26] 1,069 casualties and 69 deaths. The battalion was back in the trenches for the end of the year
[00:39:36] and the start of the new one on December 30th. The battalion's headquarters was sheld,
[00:39:41] suffering two men killed and four injured. On February 14th, German artillery shells fell again in
[00:39:48] the battalion killing five and injuring 15. By the time the first battalion left the trenches
[00:39:52] the next evening, it had suffered the losses of nine killed and 51 injured.
[00:40:00] It underscores the losses suffered by the British army during the first World War,
[00:40:04] when 7,000 soldiers were killed and wounded every day as a matter of course.
[00:40:15] 7,000 a day. March 17th as they marched the four miles to begin a period of rest that was
[00:40:26] the last month, two men were killed and three men were wounded. How the soldiers were afflicted
[00:40:30] is not recorded. It's first spelled back in the trenches so they go get some rest now. It's coming
[00:40:37] back in the first spelled back in the trenches after a month away from the line five were wounded and
[00:40:42] five killed. During April, Harry reported sick with nerves and was treated at a dressing station for
[00:40:48] two weeks before returning to front line duty. His problems were worsening. Yet the fact
[00:40:56] he was not sent far behind the lines, suggest medical officers did not deem him sick enough to be evacuated.
[00:41:08] June 3rd, another operation losses during the operation were heavy with one officer in five
[00:41:15] sergeants killed as well as five other ranks. Two sergeants in 24 other ranks were wounded
[00:41:21] at total casualty rate of about 17%. On July 1st, less than 100 miles south of their position
[00:41:33] following a week in which 1.6 million shells were fired, British forces attacked on mass
[00:41:41] on a 15 mile long front. The slaughter that ensued on the first day of the battle of the
[00:41:47] Psalm was prodigious with almost 60,000 British casualties a third of them dead.
[00:41:57] News of the slaughter took days to filter back to Britain and thanks to heavy censorship of the
[00:42:01] press, the horrors of the battle were not truly expressed but the casualty lists gave no lie to the
[00:42:07] situation. On July 15th, the west Yorkshire's left camp and moved by train to E.B.
[00:42:19] where they relieved the 11th battalion. Harry again reported sick with nerves on July 22nd and was
[00:42:26] detained by medical corps soldiers for the day but this time he was returned as fit for duty the next day.
[00:42:31] So this guy's fallen apart, he keeps asking for help and he keeps sending him back to the front.
[00:42:38] And mind you, he's in a state, not all the time but he's at least reaching a state where he can't even
[00:42:43] write a letter to his wife. Can't even steady his hand for that and they're putting him back to the
[00:42:48] front over and over again. On August 6th, the camp was broken and the battalion marched the battalion
[00:42:53] adjoined the battle of the Psalm. Inchemists for the unprecedented British losses and intensity of the
[00:42:58] shelling operation, the next four days were spent in the brigade reserve as before with hundreds of
[00:43:04] men sent digging and carrying duties. This work proved more hazardous than the previous week with
[00:43:11] four killed nine wounded, one man messing believed to have blown up. On September 11th, the battalion
[00:43:18] proceeded with brigade to an area known as sand pits. The following day was spent with the brigade
[00:43:24] in reserve in six men were killed and four more were wounded. A man admitted general British offensive
[00:43:32] across the sector involving the use of the latest weapon tanks. On September 18th, the battalion joined
[00:43:38] other forces of six division in attacking opposing trenches at 550 AM whistle sounded along the line
[00:43:45] as soldiers poured up over the front trenches through previously cut barbed wire and between
[00:43:51] breastworks. Companies were met with very heavy machine gun and rifle fire and more first
[00:43:59] forced to retreat back from the trenches where the attack started from. The cost was shockingly high
[00:44:06] with more than 100 casualties across the battalion and attrition rate of more than 10 percent
[00:44:11] among the 13 dead were three officers, almost 100 officers, almost 100 soldiers were wounded
[00:44:17] including four officers. Later on September 19th, the exhausted soldiers made their way to
[00:44:26] billets eight miles away where they remained overnight in the following day. The attack was considered
[00:44:33] a success but private far had not taken part in the operation. His final nervous collapse took
[00:44:39] place on September 17th. Harriet fallen out sick on September 16th yet when he made his way to
[00:44:46] addressing station the following day he was not seen because he was not wounded. On September 17th
[00:44:53] he was ordered to the front in the company of a rations party but was found at 11 PM that night
[00:44:58] at the same place behind the lines having disobeyed the order. When he was subsequently sent to
[00:45:05] the front under escort he struggled with his guards and was released after refusing to see a
[00:45:11] medical officer further forward. Harry ran back towards the transport lines in the rear and was
[00:45:17] held under guard before being placed under arrest on September 18th and charged with cowardice.
[00:45:24] The timing of his collapse ahead of the impending attack may have helped along the decision to
[00:45:29] charge him. The battle of the song resulted in the greatest loss of life in military history at
[00:45:37] the time for negligible gains. Across the whole offensive during that awful summer and autumn
[00:45:45] between July 1st and November 19th British Army suffered 420,000 casualties. The French
[00:45:52] 195,000 and the German losses stood between 500 and 650,000.
[00:45:58] So the massive fighting that was going on at the battle of song was also reflected in the fact
[00:46:08] that there being super hostile towards him. On October 2nd, 1916, private Harry Far
[00:46:19] stood trial by field general court martial which was convened atville Serenke in France.
[00:46:32] Since his nervous collapse and arrest, his battalion had again been an action following their
[00:46:37] part in the success in the capture of the quadrilateral. This time they had helped attack and take
[00:46:46] the village of libuffs on September 25th part of the wider battle of more fall. It was against
[00:46:54] this backdrop of missing two significant actions that Harry was tried. A field general court
[00:47:02] martial was a wartime disciplinary tribunal with the power to try all military offenses. So obviously,
[00:47:10] you know these guys are they're not looking to hear about your excuses of why you can't
[00:47:15] get after it with the rest of the troops and the rest of the troops are going forward.
[00:47:20] The rest of the troops are going forward and they're fighting and they're fighting hard and
[00:47:25] they're making incredible sacrifices. Something that he wasn't physically able to do at this
[00:47:31] point. He was de-losted. He had seen too much, he had done too much and he was done.
[00:47:36] So they're sending him to court martial. Harry was charged with an offense contrary to section
[00:47:49] for seven of the army act of 1881. The exact charge was misbehaving before the enemy in such a manner
[00:47:58] as to show cowardice to which he pleaded not guilty. He Harry appeared without a prisoner's friend.
[00:48:07] So there was no there was no like lawyer to defend him. It was just him. Just him.
[00:48:16] Assess the overall situation captain Whitlow said, I cannot say what has destroyed this man's
[00:48:22] nerves, but he has proved himself on many occasions incapable of keeping his head in action and
[00:48:28] likely to cause a panic. However, the officer made a point of differentiating between these problems
[00:48:34] and the unfortunate soldiers nature, saying apart from his behavior, his conduct and character
[00:48:39] are very good. So he's got one person that comes forward and says, hey, he's not a bad guy.
[00:48:43] He's just he's just lost it right now. Because he did a fair amount of fighting. The next piece of
[00:48:54] evidence was signed by W William the Batangans medical officer. He wrote, I hear by certified
[00:49:01] that I examined private Harry far first Batangan, York's on October 2, 1916 and that in my opinion,
[00:49:10] both the general physical and mental condition or satisfactory. Interestingly, the word good
[00:49:16] appears before the word satisfactory, but is struck out by the same hand, indicating some doubts
[00:49:23] in the officer's mind. The trial began formally with a prosecution witness,
[00:49:28] regimental Sergeant Major H. Laking, who said on 17 September 1916, about 9 a.m. the accused
[00:49:38] reported himself to me at a line transport. He states that he was sick and had fallen out from
[00:49:44] the company, the night previous on the march up to the trenches. He states he could not find
[00:49:48] his company commander for permission to fall out. I ordered him to report to the dressing station.
[00:49:53] When he returns, he states that they would not see him and as he was not wounded. I then ordered
[00:49:58] him to proceed to the Batangan with the ration party, which was going in the evening. The
[00:50:03] ration party paraded about 8 p.m. the accused was present and marched off with it on the arrival
[00:50:09] at the ration dump company quartermaster Sergeant Booth reported to me that the accused was missing.
[00:50:16] On returning to the first line for about 11 p.m. I saw the accused standing near a brazier.
[00:50:25] I asked him why he was there. He replies, I cannot stand it. I asked him what he meant. He again
[00:50:32] replies, I cannot stand it. I told him he would have to go to the trenches that night. He replies,
[00:50:38] I cannot go. I order company quartermaster Sergeant Booth to take him up to the trenches under
[00:50:48] escort after going 500 yards. The accused commences to scream and struggle with his escort. I
[00:50:54] again warned him that he would have to go to the trenches or be tried for cowardice. He replied,
[00:50:59] I am not fit to go to the trenches. I then said I would take him to see a medical officer. He refused
[00:51:05] to go saying, I will not go any further that way. I ordered the escort to take him on.
[00:51:11] The accused started to get struggling and screaming.
[00:51:19] So they were actually want to take him to a medical officer that's further forward and he's not going.
[00:51:23] He's done. The second witness to be called was company quartermaster Sergeant J.W. Booth
[00:51:31] of the first battalion west Yorkshire regimen. He says on September 17, 1916,
[00:51:38] about 3 p.m. I ordered the accused to parade with the carrying party at 6 p.m. to go up and
[00:51:43] join his company in the trenches. The accused paraded and marched off with the ration party
[00:51:48] on arrival at the ration dump. The accused was absent having fallen out on the way without permission.
[00:51:54] About 9 p.m. I saw the accused near the first line transport. The regimental sergeant major
[00:52:00] ordered me to take the accused with the escort to the trenches. About 500 yards from the first line
[00:52:06] transport. The accused became violent, threatened the escort and eventually broke away, returning
[00:52:11] to the first line transport. The regimental sergeant major ordered me to place the accused
[00:52:16] in charge of a guard. Those stories kind of line up. The third witness was private D. Ferrar,
[00:52:28] who also appears to have survived the war. He said on September 17, 1916, about 1130 p.m. I was
[00:52:34] ordered by company quartermaster sergeant Booth to form part of an escort to take the accused
[00:52:39] up to his company in the trenches. After going about 500 yards, the accused started struggling and
[00:52:44] saying he wanted to see a doctor. The sergeant major said he would see one when he got a bit further
[00:52:49] up. The accused refused to go any further. I tried to pull him along. The sergeant major told
[00:52:54] me to let him go and the accused went back to the first line transport.
[00:53:01] So there's the perspective of the folks that were with private far and here is private far's
[00:53:08] defense. This is what he had to say about the situation. On 16th September 1916, when going up to
[00:53:17] the trenches with my company, I fell out sick. I could not find the company officer to obtain
[00:53:21] permission. The sergeant I asked has now been wounded. I went back to the first line transport
[00:53:27] arriving there about 2 a.m. on 17th September 1916. I would have reported at once the regimental
[00:53:34] sergeant major only I was told he was a sleep. I reported about 9 a.m. on 17th September.
[00:53:41] The sergeant major told me to go to the advanced dressing station. They, however, would not see
[00:53:46] me as I was not wounded. The sergeant major told me to go up with the ration party at night.
[00:53:52] I started with this party and had to fall out sick. I could not get permission as I was in the
[00:53:59] rear and the sergeant major was in the front, but left word with a private soldier. I returned to
[00:54:05] the first line transport hoping to report sick to some medical officer there. On the sergeant
[00:54:13] majors returned, I reported to him and said I was sick and I could not stand it. He then said,
[00:54:21] you are a fucking coward and you will go to the trenches. I give fuck all for my life and I give
[00:54:28] fuck all for yours and you'll get fucking well shot. The sergeant major company quarter master
[00:54:37] booth and private Ferrari then took me toward the trenches. We went about a mile when we met a
[00:54:42] carrying party returning from returning under Lance Corporal Form. The sergeant major asked Lance
[00:54:50] Corporal Form where I was and he replied run away same as last night. I said to sergeant major,
[00:54:59] you have got this all made up for me. The sergeant major then told Lance Corporal Form to fall out
[00:55:05] two men and take me to the trenches. They commenced to shove me. I told them not to as I was sick
[00:55:11] enough as it was. The sergeant major then grabbed my rifle and said, I'll blow your fucking
[00:55:17] brains out if you don't go. I then called out for an officer but there was none. I was then tripped
[00:55:24] up and commenced to struggle after this. I do not know what happened until I found myself back
[00:55:29] in the first line transport under a guard. If the escort had not started to shove me about,
[00:55:36] I would have gone up to the trenches. It was on account of their doing this that I commenced to struggle.
[00:55:48] After the statement, Harry is cross-examine by the courts, prosecutor who asked if he had had the
[00:55:54] opportunity of reporting six since September 16th. Harry replied, yes, after I was put a
[00:56:00] under arrest on 18 September. A member of the court marshal then asked why he had not reported sick
[00:56:08] since his first arrest to which he replied, faithfully, because being away from the shell fire,
[00:56:16] I felt better. Evidence to as to the character of private far was presented to the court,
[00:56:25] the battalion's agitent, Lieutenant W. Paul stated that he knew Harry for six weeks. He said
[00:56:33] on working parties, he has three times asked for leave to fall out and returned to camp as he could
[00:56:39] not stand the noise of our the artillery. He was trembling and did not appear to be in a fit state.
[00:56:46] So Harry had spent four years in the service of his country two years before the war and two
[00:56:57] years during it, the private soldier took part in a number of actions with his infantry battalion.
[00:57:03] Most notably the battle of Louis Vais Chappelle. It was one of the most intense and
[00:57:10] traditional chapters of the entire conflict on the western front. One of the first examples of the whole
[00:57:16] sail slaughter of British troops for which the first world war has become renowned. Within months,
[00:57:23] he was in the hospital, his nerve shattered with a diagnosis of shell shock.
[00:57:31] Yet he returned to the front in October of 1915 and fought on for another 11 months,
[00:57:37] with two more spells of sickness because of his shell shock.
[00:57:45] According to Chris Walsh in the cowardice of brief history as World War I dragged on,
[00:57:52] Captain Charles Wilson of the Royal Army Medical Corps observed fear was no longer an occasional
[00:57:59] exotic visitor but a settler in our midst. It's cumulative effect, lead Wilson,
[00:58:11] later Lord Moran, which was Sir Winston Churchill's personal doctor,
[00:58:16] to think that a man's ability to hold up against it, his courage was not absolute quality of his
[00:58:22] character but something he had a certain amount of like money in a bank account and which could
[00:58:27] be depleted slowly or suddenly by the hardships and horrors of war.
[00:58:35] Harry Far had reached the limit of his endurance and could go no further.
[00:58:45] And so the trial was over. There was no lawyer, no soldiers friend, no support.
[00:58:53] And there was no mercy. Back to the book, the wording on the charge sheet was stark.
[00:59:05] Under a column entitled, finding and if convicted sentence, two words were handwritten in pencil.
[00:59:14] Guilty death. There was no right to an appeal. In late 1916, a telegram arrived for Gertrude Far
[00:59:36] from the war office. Opening the envelope with trembling hands in a fumping heart,
[00:59:44] she read the bold type written message that realized her worst fears.
[00:59:54] Harry Far had died in France, but not in battle or of wounds sustained under fire.
[01:00:02] Re-reading it in disbelief, Gertrude learned that her husband had been executed by firing squad.
[01:00:15] The stark message read, we regret to inform you that Harry Thomas Far of the first West Yorkshire
[01:00:24] Regiment has been shot for showing cowardice in the face of the enemy.
[01:00:40] Shot for showing cowardice in the face of the enemy.
[01:00:45] Unfortunately, he was not the only one. There were 351 men executed by the British Army during
[01:00:59] World War I and more than 300 of those. Just over 300 of those were for their
[01:01:05] supposed cowardice. There was a book called Shot at Don by Julian Pockowski and Julian Sikes.
[01:01:22] It's called Shot at Don because that was generally when these executions were carried out.
[01:01:26] They were carried out in the early morning. It details some of those men that actually
[01:01:34] details all the men and their deaths and provide some insight from some of the people that were there
[01:01:44] during these horrible times. So I'm going to go to that book.
[01:01:55] The first sentence of death imposed on a soldier of the BEF, which is the British Expeditionary
[01:02:01] Forces was carried out in the fifth week of the war. The condemned soldier was private Thomas
[01:02:07] Hygate from Kent. He had been born in the little village of Shoreham near Soven Oaks,
[01:02:14] Seven Oaks, and had joined the Army in February 1913, like many who enlisted for regular Army
[01:02:21] service, the latter joined up at the age of 17. After less than two weeks in action, the
[01:02:29] private deserted on the day that he went missing. His battalion had started to move northwards
[01:02:34] advancing. Hygate, who's wearing civilian clothing, was discovered by a gamekeeper, hiding in a barn.
[01:02:41] His uniform is concealed nearby. When questioned, he said, I want to get out of it,
[01:02:46] and this is how I'm going to do it. Not surprisingly private, Hygate was found guilty.
[01:02:52] The sentence imposed was that he would suffer death by being shot. 17-year-old kid
[01:03:08] in March 1952 soldiers from one West Yorkshire Regiment were convicted of desertion,
[01:03:13] and then were shot within a few days of each other. The first Lance Corp.
[01:03:18] The first Lance Corp. Alfred Atkinson, deserted whilst in rest. The battalion being under orders
[01:03:24] to proceed to the front. In January of that year, Atkinson had won a sum of money gambling.
[01:03:30] And after about a drinking, subsequently deserted. After three weeks, he was then arrested
[01:03:35] by the military police. At his trial, the court was told that Atkinson was a good soldier,
[01:03:41] and previously of excellent character, as a result, his sentence bore a recommendation to
[01:03:46] mercy. A soldier serving with the battalion at the time later confirmed his opinion, saying that Atkinson
[01:03:51] was clean, smart, brave soldier represented by all, or respected by all his comrades.
[01:03:58] When General Sir Horus Smith-Dorian reviewed the proceedings, he was of the opinion that an example
[01:04:04] was required. And the sentence was confirmed.
[01:04:08] And here's an eyewitness of an account, the two men, and this is labor MP Ernst Thurdle.
[01:04:21] The two men I selected for the firing party went with the accident. When they came back,
[01:04:28] tough characters, though they were supposed to be, they were sick. They screamed in their sleep.
[01:04:35] They vomited immediately after eating. All they could say was, the site was horrible,
[01:04:40] made more so by the fact that we had shot one of our own men.
[01:04:48] Private Abraham Beveresteen was the only son of an East End family, because it was considered
[01:04:56] dishonorable in certain Jewish circles to be a soldier. Beveresteen had signed up under the false
[01:05:04] name of Harris. 1915 Christmas Eve, private Beveresteen was wounded. In the back, he was admitted to the
[01:05:13] hospital, suffering from these wounds and also from shock. In his letters home, private Beveresteen told
[01:05:19] of his progress in the hospital, that he had been detained there since 19 January 1916,
[01:05:24] because he had developed a pressure sword on his heel. First January 1916, dear mother.
[01:05:30] I'm very sorry that it did not write before now, but we were in the trenches on Christmas Day,
[01:05:36] and we had a lot to do. Also, I was taken ill and was sent to the hospital. I'm feeling a little
[01:05:41] better so don't get upset. Also don't send any letters to the company, because I won't get them.
[01:05:46] Also, you cannot send any letters to the hospital, as I won't get them. Dear mother,
[01:05:50] do not worry, I will be all right. Hoping all of you are getting on well. I was only hurt in the back.
[01:05:56] I will try to send you letters every few days if I can to let you know how I am getting on. We
[01:06:01] get plenty of food in the hospital. Dear mother, I know it will break your heart this,
[01:06:06] but don't be upset about it. I will be all right, but I would very much like to see you. I will
[01:06:12] try my very best. He did recover and he went back to the front. On 13 February, the soldier had
[01:06:27] left his position in the front line trenches and made his way to one of the company headquarters
[01:06:32] in the rear. He reported to his company, quartermaster sergeant and stated that a grenade had
[01:06:36] burst very close to him and that he was suffering from shock, believing him to be a nervous
[01:06:40] condition. This NCO told Harris to report the medical officer, Beverestein reported to the medical
[01:06:47] officer who examined him, but found nothing wrong. As a result, the private was ordered to return
[01:06:51] to the trenches. Beverestein, however, did not obey, but made his way to a farmhouse in the rear
[01:06:57] where he took refuge. Shortly thereafter, whilst warming himself by a fire and officer,
[01:07:01] from another regiment came into the farmhouse and suspecting that Beverestein was a deserter placed
[01:07:06] the lad under arrest. The letter sent home, indicated that Beverestein was in trouble, but did not
[01:07:12] disclose the serious nature of his predicament. Clearly as a soldier did not realize that his life
[01:07:17] was at stake, but the letters relate that at the time of his desertion, the private had been feeling
[01:07:22] unwell. 23 February, 1916, dear mother, we were in the trenches and I was ill, so I went out and
[01:07:29] they took me to prison and I am in bed of trouble now and I won't get any money for a long time.
[01:07:34] I will have to go to the front, go in front of a court. I will try my best to get out of it, so don't
[01:07:39] worry, but dear mother tried to send some money, not very much, but try your best. I will let you know
[01:07:45] in my next how I got on, give my best love to mother, father, and Kate, your loving son,
[01:07:52] Abby. On March 4th, when he was court, Marshall, private members didn't explain that on the
[01:07:58] day of his absence. A grenade had exploded beside him and this had been more than his nerves could stand.
[01:08:05] He added that he had then lost control. The court was unimpressed by this story and in spite of
[01:08:10] an unblemished record, the soldier was sentenced to death. And the finding was confirmed by the
[01:08:16] commander in chief, private Beverestein's parents were left unaware of their son's predicament.
[01:08:21] The next communication which they received came from the army. It was an official
[01:08:25] army form which carried a blunt message. Sir, I am directed to inform you that a report has been
[01:08:33] received from the war office to the effect that private Harris A11th Battalion Middle Sex Regiment.
[01:08:39] G.S. was signed with sentence after trial by court Marshall to suffer death by being shot for
[01:08:46] desertion and the sentence was duly executed on 20 March 1916. Another one and again, this book is
[01:08:56] details every single soldier. You know, picking out some of the ones that stood out a bit to me.
[01:09:03] The next soldier concerned was rifleman Albert Parker serving with seven King's Royal
[01:09:10] rifle. Corne has crime as typical example of desertion committed with the intention of avoiding
[01:09:14] service in the line 35 year old Parker admitted drunkeness at his trial, but this did not mitigate
[01:09:20] his offense. And I witnessed later recalled the promulgation of sentence and the execution that
[01:09:26] followed. Then the prisoner's cap was taken off. And he was told to take one pace forward, which he did.
[01:09:36] The APM commenced to read the papers. The man was then told to take a pace back again,
[01:09:42] which he did without a quiver. A brave man at that moment wasn't to be found in France.
[01:09:48] He was then marched away to the place where he was to be shot.
[01:09:54] We were then ordered to about turn and the brigade transport officer threatened us that any man
[01:10:00] who turned around would be put on a crime. So we stood in silence for what seemed hours, although
[01:10:08] only minutes. Then the shots rang out. And one of the Yorkshire's fainid, the strain was that great.
[01:10:16] Still we stood in silence until we heard another shot, which I afterwards ascertained was the doctor's
[01:10:22] shot to make sure he was dead.
[01:10:26] Private Phillips of one cold stream guards was executed for desertion. The clergymen who attended
[01:10:39] private Phillips was Captain T. Guy Rogers, chaplain to the second guards brigade. The clergyman
[01:10:47] documented his feelings in what he clearly regarded as a most harring or deal. 31 May 1916
[01:10:55] Sha'alai tell you over the terrible experience I've just gone through.
[01:11:00] If so, it must not go beyond the family circle of yourself and the hauslums.
[01:11:07] It is just fallen to my lot to prepare a deserter for his death. That meant breaking the news to him,
[01:11:14] helping him with his last letters, passing the night with him on the straw in his cell,
[01:11:19] and trying to prepare his soul for meeting God. The execution and bearing him immediately.
[01:11:29] The shadow was just hanging over me when I wrote the last letter, but I tried to keep it out.
[01:11:33] Monday night I was with him Tuesday morning at 3.30. He was shot. He laid beside me for hours with his
[01:11:40] hand in mind. Poor fellow. It was a bad case, but he met his end bravely and drinking all I could
[01:11:46] teach him about God, his father, Jesus' savior and the reality of the forgiveness of sins.
[01:11:53] I feel shaken by it all, but my nerves thank God have not troubled me. Everyone has been so kind
[01:11:59] who knew of the ordeal. I will tell you some more some other time. I want to get it off and away
[01:12:05] from the thought of it as much as I can. Here's a few guys that deserted together in a group
[01:12:19] Lance Sergeant Joseph Stone's Lance Corporal Peter Goggins and Lance Corporal John McDonald.
[01:12:30] In the new year when Sir Douglas Hay came to review the sentences he committed. Those imposed
[01:12:35] on the four private, so there's four private with these guys, these guys were the leaders of this
[01:12:39] group that deserted, which were suspended. But an eyewitness account recorded the final moments of
[01:12:46] the three condemned NCOs shot on 18 January. Come out you ordered the Corporal of the Guard to me.
[01:12:53] I crawled forth. It was snowing heavily. Stand here. He said pushing me between two centuries. Quick
[01:12:58] march. And the way we went, not as I dreaded to my first taste of packed drill, but out and up a
[01:13:05] long street to an R.E. dump. There the police Corporal handed in a chit, where upon three posts,
[01:13:14] three roast ropes, and a spade were given to me to carry back. Our return journey took us past
[01:13:20] the guard room up a short hill until we reached the secluded spot surrounded by trees.
[01:13:25] Certain measurements were made in the snow after which I was ordered to dig three holes as
[01:13:32] stipulated distances apart. I began to wonder, could it be? No, perhaps spies. Perhaps,
[01:13:43] so perhaps only my fancy. The next scene appears, and we colded on. A crowd of brass hats,
[01:13:51] the medical officer, and three firing parties. Three stakes a few yards apart, and a ring of
[01:13:57] centuries around the woodmen to keep the curious away. The motor ambulance arrives conveying the
[01:14:05] doomed men, mannicked and blindfolded. They are helped out and tied up to the stakes.
[01:14:14] Over each man's heart is placed in envelope. At the sign of command, the firing
[01:14:20] parties 12 each align their rifles on the envelopes. The officer in charge holds his stick aloft,
[01:14:31] and as it falls, 36 bullets, usher the souls of three of Kishner's men to the great unknown.
[01:14:42] As a military prisoner, I helped clear the traces of the triple murder.
[01:14:46] I took the post down. I helped carry those bodies toward their last resting place. I collected
[01:14:54] all the bloods soaked, straw, and burnt it. Acting upon instructions, I took their belongings from
[01:15:02] the dead men's tunics discarded before being shot. A few letters, a pipe, some fags, a photo.
[01:15:10] I could tell you of the silence of the military police after reading one letter from a little
[01:15:18] girl to dear daddy. Another private David Stevenson, when Sensing Danger, the soldier had run off
[01:15:29] when questioned the private that lied saying that he was working for another town mayor,
[01:15:34] unfortunately for Stevenson, he was already under suspected. Suspended sentence for previous
[01:15:39] offense of dissurtion. The recollections of an ex sergeant who had been in charge of the firing
[01:15:46] squad, who shot private Stevenson or published after the war. It was a terrible scene.
[01:15:52] Being that I knew him made it worse for me. The ten men were selected for the firing squad
[01:15:58] from a few details left out of the line. They were nervous to wreck themselves and two of them had
[01:16:05] not the nerve to fire. Of course, they were tried by court martial, but they were found to be
[01:16:11] medically unfit. Their nerves had gone. The last words, the lad said were, what will my mother say?
[01:16:24] You have one more. This was an interesting writing. There was a private, name, private,
[01:16:31] Frederick Butcher and the report that comes out was actually published in a newspaper
[01:16:40] years after the execution, but he calls the private Frederick Butcher. He calls him Jim.
[01:16:48] But this eyewitness to his execution wrote about it in a paper.
[01:16:54] I shall call him Jim. He had been out three years. He had been wounded, but he was wounded at
[01:17:04] time when wounded were cared for in France and were back in the line in six weeks.
[01:17:10] There was nothing about Jim which attracted special attention. He was the average,
[01:17:15] happy go lucky sort of lad who did the day's work on an average in the average way.
[01:17:20] War had become normal to him and he had settled down to that fatalism
[01:17:27] which characterized so many of our men when they said, if it is to be, it will, and if it ain't,
[01:17:35] it won't. As if he had suddenly been hit in the mind, he stood stock still to
[01:17:42] still one night and point blank refused to go over with a rating party. In an instant,
[01:17:49] he became a marked man. His comrades could not quite determine whether it was bravery or idiocy.
[01:17:56] Perhaps some string had snapped. Some, something somewhere had gone wrong,
[01:18:04] but Jim just refused. He was exceedingly nervous, but such a breach of discipline was in itself
[01:18:12] sufficient to account for that. By the time he stood on the map before the court,
[01:18:17] he had partly regained his normal composure, but the seriousness of the situation had washed away
[01:18:22] the color from his face and there was a dull, laden looking his blue eyes.
[01:18:29] His record saved him. It was good and his judges tempered judgment with mercy and consideration.
[01:18:36] He had been many, he had had many, many, many captains and all, and with all he had done as bit.
[01:18:43] That the court gave him a chance. He made no excuse whatsoever, but when question,
[01:18:49] but when asked the question, he promised that it would not occur again.
[01:18:57] A week later, it did occur again. And the next court sentenced him to death.
[01:19:05] Blind folded with his hands tied behind him, he was to be shot at dawn the following day.
[01:19:10] From the death century, Jim learned the names of the officer and men who would ascend him
[01:19:19] west next morning. They were all his friends. Two or three officers who had known him for years
[01:19:28] went into the death hut and said goodbye, somehow none of them could quite catalog Jim as a coward.
[01:19:34] Terrible things happen in war, but nothing perhaps is more terrible than to send one of
[01:19:44] your own out of life when you are not quite sure whether he is a coward or a marker.
[01:19:52] The world will never know the real truth. There was no psychologist there to give an opinion.
[01:19:57] Even if there had been, it might not have altered the course of events. Discipline even then might
[01:20:04] have won an unfair victory over science. In the mechanism of Jim's mentality, a cog slipped
[01:20:15] and the wheels revolved irregularly. From what the CEO and Jim's pals told me,
[01:20:24] I am fully persuaded that Jim died as a marker to discipline.
[01:20:32] Jim was blindfolded. His hands were bound together behind him. As he stood there, calm and steady as a rock.
[01:20:41] The orders were given. Goodbye sir. Goodbye boys. He said, just as if you were off on a
[01:20:53] 10-day for a low. There was no reply. The subaltern was choked with emotion and the firing squad
[01:21:02] as heart-wrench as he dared not reply. The sharp crack of a volley smothered size of relief from the squad
[01:21:13] and all was over. All saved laying beneath the soil of France.
[01:21:23] There were Jim lies. There shall remain forever a little bit of England.
[01:21:40] Well, as I said, this is a awful thing. I'm sorry to have to bring it up and I'm sorry to
[01:22:03] have to talk about it. I'm sorry that we human beings are capable of this. And at the same time,
[01:22:18] it's good to know what we are capable of so that we can prevent it.
[01:22:22] And eventually in 2006, after way too long and after a lot of effort and hard work by a lot of
[01:22:37] compassionate people, the British government admitted that it was wrong. And the story of that effort
[01:22:44] is retraced in the first book I read from he was no coward and it resulted in the pardon of Harry
[01:22:56] Far and of 306 of the other soldiers who were executed, who were shot at dawn for the crime of having
[01:23:10] psychological breakdown under the immense mental and physical trauma of World War I.
[01:23:21] And in 2006, Harry Far's daughter, Gerdi, who we started this story off with. Gerdi was presented
[01:23:30] with a letter from the secretary defense Desmond Brown, which included the official pardon for Harry
[01:23:40] Far and it reads, this document records that private Harry Far of the first battalion of the West
[01:23:49] Yorkshire Regiment, who is executed for cowardice on 18 October 1916, his pardoned under section 359
[01:23:58] of the Armed Forces Act of 2006. The pardon stands as recognition that he was one of many victims
[01:24:10] of the first World War and that execution was not a fate he deserved.
[01:24:17] Signed Desmond Brown, secretary of state, four defense.
[01:24:33] And so he was pardoned and I would say that private Harry Far we, we beg your pardon.
[01:24:42] And I would say let us learn something from this something about leadership and something
[01:24:55] about our behavior as human beings, our nature as human beings, let us learn something
[01:25:02] from the fate of Harry Far. And that is that we as human beings are not in foul, but we are not
[01:25:16] perfect and we will fall short of the ideals that we aspire to. We'll fall short of those.
[01:25:24] And we may not always be as bold and we may not always be as heroic and we may not always be as
[01:25:33] brave as we want, but while we may fall short on those traits, let us never fall short
[01:25:45] in compassion, in sympathy and in understanding. And let us when we look to judge others,
[01:26:03] let us remember and let us know that our judgment is as imperfect as we are.
[01:26:16] And remember that it is us who in the words of Wilford Owens,
[01:26:25] we are the ones that dealt them war and madness. And so let us also be the ones who deal them mercy
[01:26:42] and forgiveness. And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So echo Charles.
[01:27:03] Kind of a ruffling. Yeah. Odd. It's like an odd feeling, just that even that
[01:27:12] final part of that last book. You know, you got to essentially kill or witness both your friend
[01:27:25] and even until that. It's not like you guys are friends. He betrays you, you know, and you're
[01:27:32] mad at him and then you kill him. It's not that. It's like, yeah, some other thing kind of happened.
[01:27:37] Meanwhile, you're still friends. And then you got to be a part of in whatever way. Like right
[01:27:43] in front of this face too, like him dying. And the kind where you're literally saying bye.
[01:27:50] Hey, bye and then next one. Yeah. And yeah, just kind of, you know, when you think,
[01:27:55] you read these books, you have this picture in your mind, you know. And it's just it's so off
[01:28:01] putting just all the different facets that just come to play with a scenario like that.
[01:28:06] And there's, I mean, obviously, there's a, there's a huge dichotomy in this,
[01:28:11] is the huge dichotomy in this is that there's all these millions of brave soldiers
[01:28:20] that went that went over the top and they were killed. And so how can you have any sympathy for
[01:28:28] the people that are like, no, I can't do it. And the answer is you've got to recognize that
[01:28:34] different people are different. And, and you know, it's interesting that that last guy calls him a
[01:28:40] marker. And the perspective that even someone that stood by him and someone that fought and took
[01:28:46] the same risks and could have been killed himself and happened to live, he recognizes like, hey,
[01:28:53] yeah, this, this happens. And, you know, there's one part that kind of, when you would hear about
[01:29:00] this guy, the one guy gets rolled up or gets caught by some guy that's patrolling around the
[01:29:05] rear looking for desergers. It's like, yeah, when I hear about that guy, I can picture that guy,
[01:29:11] can picture that guy. He's in the rear. So, you know, you need more brave, get, get up to the front.
[01:29:16] Like, you can picture that guy. And that, that kind of makes me angry because you got somebody that's
[01:29:23] in the rear policing up people sending them to the front. Why don't you up on the front?
[01:29:27] Yeah, get up there yourself. But yeah, so there's a dichotomy to it in that, you know, you, you,
[01:29:38] I mean, obviously you uphold and have the utmost respect for the bravery of the people that
[01:29:47] step up and, and they're on put them on the highest pedestal. And then you've got these people
[01:29:53] that contradict that. I think that the line gets drawn in the fact that these guys lose control.
[01:30:02] They can't do it. They can't do it anymore. They, they mentally can't take it. And again, you know,
[01:30:08] it's the same thing that Dick Winner said, the same thing that Hackworth said, there's guys
[01:30:13] reach a limit and they're done. And only people that have been in extensive combat recognize
[01:30:19] that the people reach a point. And there's, there's that whole section in band of brothers,
[01:30:24] where that some of those guys that are total studs, they can't go anymore. They break down.
[01:30:30] And Dick Winner's is like, okay, as a leader this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to do my
[01:30:34] best to take care of them. If they, if we can get them recovered, cool, if not respect,
[01:30:39] if not, hey, it's okay. You did what you could. Yeah. It's a, it's a strange dichotomy.
[01:30:45] Yeah. And you can't help but try to imagine not necessarily the specific scenario, but like,
[01:30:52] what is it, how does it feel to literally like not be able to do something? You know, like,
[01:30:58] you, yeah, well, there's a lot of shame for these guys that that came home and they were shame
[01:31:03] that they weren't wounded. They weren't physically wounded. And, and the government treated them
[01:31:07] very badly in many cases. They look, oh, your cowards. And so it's awful. It's absolutely awful.
[01:31:16] It's why hate World War I. I hate World War I. Yeah. And that's a shoot. That's the thing, too.
[01:31:22] It's not like, you know, they're taking a spin class and they quit halfway through because they
[01:31:28] were too tired or something like that. This is no echo you are correct. They're not in this
[01:31:32] spin class. This is World War I. By the way, like super treacherous, super. Yeah. And then you're like,
[01:31:40] oh, yeah, what? You don't have the guts or you don't, you're not brave enough for this. And then
[01:31:45] people, people back and back in the safety of call, call a judgment on, on guys that. And that's
[01:31:51] the other thing is these guys almost, every one of those guys, they had fought for some certain
[01:31:55] amount of time. They fought for six months, 12 months, a year, two years, whatever, they had fought
[01:32:01] and fought and they broke years. So, yeah, man. It's awful. It's awful. But, you know, I think it's
[01:32:11] something that if we can keep in perspective, because there's so much judging, you know what?
[01:32:16] I mean, people judge each other all the time. It's like, you know what? Take a wrap off your judgment.
[01:32:22] That was that was my, that was sort of what I was thinking through the whole time. I was thinking
[01:32:27] about how often am I judging someone. Yeah. You know, you know, you don't get the judge. You
[01:32:32] don't get the judge. You just, you just do, you worry about you. And, hey, instead of trying to
[01:32:38] judge, why don't you try and help someone? There's a novel idea. Instead of placing judgment on
[01:32:43] someone that's having a hard time with something, why don't you try and help them? Why don't you try
[01:32:47] and figure out how you can support them? Why don't you figure out what they need? It's
[01:32:52] think of anyone had that attitude. One person would have stepped up and said, hey, look,
[01:32:56] I know this guy. He was a good guy. Let me try and get him back in the game. Let me try and
[01:33:01] figure out what's wrong. Instead of everyone jumping on board, the judgment banned wagon. Yeah,
[01:33:08] it kind of seems like it's that feeling of like, I'm over here. You're over there. Like,
[01:33:14] hey, I don't need that kind of help. So why should you kind of thing?
[01:33:18] Don't judge. Don't judge. All right. Well, instead of judging help, how's that? That's
[01:33:27] my motto. Yeah. Instead of placing judgment, how would you help someone out? Support somebody.
[01:33:33] Support. I like what you just did there. Speaking of which, how about let's go into some
[01:33:40] support. You know, support yourself before you go to that that opening poem by Wilford Owen is freaking legit.
[01:33:49] Freaking legit. And it's, I should read it again. I should have read it at the end or something.
[01:33:55] Go back and listen to it because it's it's it's it's a it's incredible poem from a guy that went
[01:34:01] through all that. He went into the psychological war. If it was called that, he went through the what
[01:34:07] would be it would have been called a psychological war at the time. And then he went back to the front.
[01:34:12] And then he was awarded for valor. And then he got killed. And he wrote that powerful powerful
[01:34:19] poem. It's freaking awesome. So I had to throw that out there. Go back and listen to it. Yeah.
[01:34:26] It's really well. Support if you will. Back to support. Back to support.
[01:34:34] All right. Here are some outstanding ways to support yourself. And let's podcast. If you're down for that.
[01:34:44] First, origin. Okay. Origin is our company. I feel like it's everybody's company. Really?
[01:34:50] No, it's not. Well, let's say maybe now we can't include our international listeners on that.
[01:34:55] We can definitely include our American listeners. If you're an American listener if you're here in the
[01:35:00] good old US of A, origin is our company and you're including that. Yeah. And for sure. But I have been,
[01:35:07] you know, I've been hearing things that even people in the UK, they're waiting. They're open arms.
[01:35:14] When are we getting mock in the UK when, you know, they're asking these questions.
[01:35:20] So open arms. Boom. I think that it is it is or soon to become everyone's company. Yeah.
[01:35:26] Check. It's just a kind of company. It is, it's faces. Just because everything's made in America,
[01:35:30] which I'll go into. Does it mean you have to be American to be true?
[01:35:35] Yeah. You could be, you could be down for just good treatment of the workers. Yeah.
[01:35:41] They're not in a sweat shop. No. They're actually in a, they're actually on one, one, twenty, five.
[01:35:47] High Street. Okay. I don't know what it won 25 is, but I dig it. That's the address. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:35:53] But maybe that was some sort of a term. No. There wasn't some sort of a term. Anyway. Yes.
[01:36:03] Okay. Or did so. What do we got at origin? Okay. If you're on the Juditube app,
[01:36:06] if you're on the path and you do so is part of your specific situation.
[01:36:11] Boom. You're going to need a geek. You're going to want a geek. You don't need a geek.
[01:36:15] Don't need anything. This is what you're going to want. Big time. You kind of need a geek.
[01:36:19] If you're going to try and do Ditsa with a geek, you're going to need a geek. Well, yes.
[01:36:23] That's the show tonight. No. All right. Well, here you go. So you do need a geek.
[01:36:26] You know, you don't need to train no geek. You're just too, but it is highly recommended.
[01:36:32] In fact, it is an affirmative. You should train geek and no geek. Yes. So I would personally agree with that.
[01:36:38] Ge, no geek, due to both all everything. So therefore we can conclude we do need a geek. Yes.
[01:36:45] And if you're wondering what geek to get, boom, wonder, no more. Origin has geese all made in America by the way.
[01:36:51] But these are quality quality geese made from scratch, by the way, by origin for jiu jitsu specifically.
[01:37:00] Anyway, best geese in the world. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Kind of by far too. Yeah. Yeah. There's not much competition out there.
[01:37:09] Anyway, originmate.com. That's where you get them. Geese, rash guards. Also some other stuff.
[01:37:15] You know, some joggers, some sweat suits, some shirts, you know, that kind of stuff. A pair of sweat suits.
[01:37:20] I think it's funny when you go, would you represent the full origin, sweat suit? Yeah.
[01:37:25] I mean, you're suit. Yes, sir. Yeah. Max comfort. Max comfort.
[01:37:31] Excerning to for yourself. But yes, all that stuff. You got your supplements too. We got supplements.
[01:37:35] Origin. And we got joint warfare for your joints. We got criloil, which is for your joints and everything else.
[01:37:42] And what else? Discipline. Discipline gives you a little edge. Yeah.
[01:37:50] Edge the mats of jiu jitsu and on the mats of life. Of life. Yes. Very much so mental edge physical edge.
[01:37:59] Vitamin, vitamins are specific, but we'll say for lack of a term, vitamins for you,
[01:38:04] bring. Like a whole situation. And then you got milk, which is, which is glorious. It's a protein
[01:38:14] dessert fortified. Here's the thing, but okay. So here's the thing about milk, which I found out. If I
[01:38:20] keep finding these things out here, I'm not the kind, apparently I'm not the kind person who's like
[01:38:25] doing all the research. What benefits of this thing? Apparently, I thought I was that kind of
[01:38:30] percent. You started drinking it? Yeah, you're like, you're like, you're like, you're like, cool. I'll
[01:38:34] taste it. Boom. My taste it and taste like super good. So I'm like, okay. I'm in and then you
[01:38:38] tend you start to become in the mood for some milkshake. I'm milkshake. Yeah. milkshake.
[01:38:45] And so I'll be like, yeah, I'm kind of, here's what I did do. I did this a bunch of times in a row.
[01:38:51] So I guess I do this. I make a peanut butter jelly sandwich. And a milkshake. Yeah. And I put some
[01:38:59] of the peanut butter in the mold. Okay. And that's the chocolate mint one. Yeah. Okay. And that's a weird thing.
[01:39:06] It is. Well, it still tastes good. It tastes really good. Wait, wait, what's weird? Peanut butter
[01:39:11] jelly sandwich? Peanut butter and mint. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Together. No, see. And you think yeah,
[01:39:18] sure that is kind of odd. It's not odd. Okay. Well, you want to have to do that for much longer. Yeah.
[01:39:22] Because we got peanut butter milk all the time. So you can just be cool. Just chill with all that
[01:39:27] peanut butter in the mint. And to me, it's all good. Put it all all in there.
[01:39:32] B&J is coming out. She's strong. You're just getting all up on the peanut butter jelly sandwich. It's
[01:39:36] like you're like your nine years old. I know very remember old school. That's the way to get late.
[01:39:41] I don't remember that. I just remember. Oh, what's for breakfast? What PBJ? What's for lunch?
[01:39:45] PB&J. Yeah. Oh, we're going. Remember the little plastic zip lock bag. Actually, we need
[01:39:50] a zip lock bag back back in the day. They just had like a fold over flap. The B.J. smeared all over
[01:39:56] that thing. Mom never put enough jelly on the peanut butter in jelly sandwich. No, never. It was all
[01:40:01] all all. The B.J. want your peanut butter in there. Why is it cheaper that cost the same thing?
[01:40:06] Put more jelly on the sandwich, mom. Come on. Where you at? Get that sweet. Just go ahead. What makes
[01:40:12] that funny is that that is 100%. It's universal. Yeah, they get the universe. I don't know what's
[01:40:16] up with the moms get taught at mom school. Lay off. They go. Hey, hold it back on the jelly. No,
[01:40:21] you know what it was. No, think about it. When you buy, I mean, I don't know how much peanut butter
[01:40:24] you buy at the store and jelly, but I'll let you know. I mean, the jelly things are a little
[01:40:30] much smaller. They're smaller and you live a bit more expensive. Yeah. Yeah. And then peanut butter
[01:40:34] thing is huge. Well, potentially. I mean, you know, you got the kids to the server.
[01:40:40] Crunchy creamy whatever. But you get the peanut the huge peanut butter. You got the little jelly
[01:40:44] with jelly's more expensive. Mom's trying to, you know, you're trying to be kind of a bit
[01:40:49] of a little bit more expensive. But the whole deal. So that home depot. So that home economics class. Do you have home economics and
[01:40:55] high school? Yeah. Yeah. I'm holding economics in high school too. Yeah, yeah. It's good. My, my, I think my little sister got kicked out
[01:41:02] of home economics. Oh, yeah. That was funny. Yeah. I could see that. Yeah. You didn't get kicked up.
[01:41:10] I definitely got in trouble a couple of times in home economics, but I, but I didn't get kicked out.
[01:41:15] But my little sister got kicked out for what putting the butter knife in the toaster for something
[01:41:20] to get what she did. I'll, I'll research that and get back with you. She was a, she's a character.
[01:41:25] So, you know, get that home economics was a little tough on her. She's a character for some reason.
[01:41:31] That doesn't surprise me. I don't know her. But, you know, I know other members of your family.
[01:41:36] Check. Mook. Yeah. You back to Mook. All right. Yeah. Yeah. So Mook protein added protein. Here's
[01:41:42] it. Okay. So back to my point. My point was I don't do all the research. You know, so I start just
[01:41:47] pounding Mook, get on the Mook train hard core and meanwhile, I'm discovering all these new things.
[01:41:53] I knew about the probiotics. But now it's like, I find out it's keto friendly. It's, I mean,
[01:42:00] unless you mix it with milk because I mix it with milk. I should make that clear. I mix it with milk.
[01:42:05] Yeah. Yeah. But you go like what, like what's, you go like I said, if you mix it with
[01:42:10] out milk, if you mix it with water, then you're talking ham sandwich level of goodness. Yeah. But there's
[01:42:14] like, it's like, it's good. Like, it's good. Like, you're like, you can get some coconut. Yeah. That's true.
[01:42:19] That's true. I haven't tried it, actually. I will try it. And here's the thing, too. And this,
[01:42:24] if you, jaco don't know that much about this part, it won't surprise me. There are so many milk,
[01:42:30] like, super-intestants. Yeah. And there are so many, oh, and like lactose-free. Oh, okay. There's like,
[01:42:37] a lot, yeah, there's a lot of options for that. And when you're talking keto, that's a whole,
[01:42:41] you know, that's a, that's a whole, like, dietary plan. Yeah. You know, so there are a lot of options.
[01:42:48] So, nonetheless, regardless of what you mix it with. Have you mixed it with that other kind of
[01:42:52] milk milk? Yeah, that, that, that, that almond milk almond milk. almond milk is not keto friendly.
[01:42:57] Is it? I don't think I'm, well, I'm not, you gotta go coconut milk. You can go coconut milk.
[01:43:02] Yeah. And you could get there. Yeah. And actually, you gotta get the real coconut milk. You can get the
[01:43:06] fake coconut. You can't get the, the, the, the, the milk that's the coconut milk that they're trying to sell
[01:43:11] you as like a health thing. Well, not, yeah, not, and keep it in my, they're dumb enough. They're
[01:43:16] dumb enough much sugar in this side. Well, wait, are you talking about coconut water? Because there's
[01:43:20] a different, coconut water, no, I'm talking about coconut milk. And I know the difference. Okay.
[01:43:25] When, bro, in Hawaii, we learn all about that in school, but a difference, we know coconut milk
[01:43:31] and coconut water. Yeah. Well, there you go. None, you were right though. You were right about the
[01:43:36] coconut milk. If you get the, you know, the unsweetened milk, the one, the real kind. Yeah, yeah,
[01:43:42] the real kind. Straight coconut milk. And that's keto you're saying. Yes. Okay. So that's the one I
[01:43:47] mixed it with. It's kind of like 10 billion grams of fat. It's so good. It's like 98 grams of fat in a
[01:43:55] can of coconut milk. Oh, good. But it's for his keto goes, that's dope. Good. But we're talking
[01:44:03] about the milk itself though. The milk is the powder. Yeah. So that's keto. So whatever you mix
[01:44:08] it with, that's going to be, you know, an extreme ownership situation. You know, if you want to
[01:44:12] stick with the keto, stick with the keto. Mocha is part of that, that deal. You can't sit there.
[01:44:16] And then the last good, good, clean protein probiotics, all these things, and it tastes good. And
[01:44:23] here's the thing. It's not like, oh, yeah, all these benefits. And then by the way, tastes good. It's not that
[01:44:27] to me. It tastes good. So and by the way, it has all this good. So you're now with me on the thing about
[01:44:33] the importance of things tasting good, or I should say the importance of things tasting good.
[01:44:40] You're with me that that is that is probably possibly the most important thing. If you're
[01:44:46] going to bring something into your game like fully, yeah, if this is going to be come part of your
[01:44:50] life, if it doesn't taste good, it's not going to come part of your life. And if you bring
[01:44:54] something, it's part of your life that tastes like crap, like how long you're going to sustain
[01:44:59] that for. And why when you can have something that delicious? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you don't,
[01:45:04] you don't have to have that beef anymore. No, for this kind of stuff. But yeah, and that's the
[01:45:10] whole reason I like it, like I said, you know, Barry Jelly sandwich with the moch, right, and
[01:45:14] I put a little bit of peanut butter in it, like I said, and I'm like, it is literally like a
[01:45:18] dessert. I'm like pounding it on that thing. Yeah. It's really good. No, last year,
[01:45:24] very good. OriginMain.com. That's where you get these outstanding things. Also,
[01:45:28] jujitsu immersion camp back to jujitsu and origin in and of itself in a lot of
[01:45:33] moch there. There's a lot of it. Yes, there's also jujitsu there. Strange laying
[01:45:40] off. I know best way to learn jujitsu most of the day. I'm sure there are exceptions, but if you
[01:45:46] immerse yourself in any activity, that's a very, very effective and good way to learn. And
[01:45:54] there's an ejujitsu immersion camp. Yeah. August 26th through September 2nd this year.
[01:46:00] Let's come in on. Yeah. A bunch of us are going. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:46:03] Doing some people that have never trained before. Wait, okay. So did we find out when
[01:46:07] that it's sold out? Because we're on the talking. I just checked the website, and it's not sold out.
[01:46:12] Okay. So it's not sold out. I don't. It might be close, but go inside up now. Yeah. And there we
[01:46:18] can go. And then yeah, well, that's the best way to find out if it's sold out. Go sign up.
[01:46:22] Yeah. If it says cool, you're signed up. You're solid. That means no. So that's
[01:46:26] bring a tent. Yeah. That could late. Tant. Get some. As I say. But yeah. Yeah.

[01:46:44] through my jeans at night. Oh, yeah. Can you imagine a mosquito? It's so psycho. It just
[01:46:49] comes up jeans. No factor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the main ones. Yeah. That's weird.
[01:46:57] Quite as mosquitoes for sure. They're not their legit mosquitoes. But I don't think
[01:47:02] maybe if you go in the mountains or something like that. Well, they only have to
[01:47:05] bite through that lightweight. They don't have to be so hardcore. No, that's true.

[01:47:44] discipline equals freedom. discipline equals freedom is the path really. Yes.
[01:47:49] It's like three. It's like the path is discipline. Actually, I don't know if that's right.
[01:47:54] Displenty equals freedom is the sort of like the roadmap. Yeah. The path is like, yeah.
[01:48:01] The path is actually doing it. Yeah. This one is the path. Yeah. And then freedom is like
[01:48:06] the destination where you're continually trying to go. Yeah. But you're just existing in this
[01:48:14] fabric of freedom because of the discipline. True. Okay. However, you want to sort of

[01:48:55] Because tank tops are the reason I style. The reason I style. As this is because
[01:48:58] first of all, I wear the same clothes forever. Yes. And I wear them until I completely destroyed.
[01:49:02] Well, I had when I met my wife, I had a bunch of tank tops. That was sort of like my go to
[01:49:08] just warm all the time because it's hot, right? Well, I don't wear them all time, but any time the
[01:49:12] temperature, anytime in the summertime, anytime. Love what that's cool. One more time. Functional.
[01:49:17] And then one day, my wife, because they were all old and ratti and they had Guinness stains on them.
[01:49:23] And they were just all jacks. But I didn't care. Of course. Because whatever. And my wife
[01:49:29] threw every single one of them away. Yeah. Every single one of them. Like just, and the thing is
[01:49:38] in her mind, it wasn't spiteful. She was actually super stoked. Like, oh yeah, I know. Oh yeah,
[01:49:44] you know how those old, I'll get your t-shirt. I threw my way. So you have to set up the shirts now.
[01:49:50] You're welcome. You know, she's coming at me with you. Welcome. And meanwhile, these were all
[01:49:55] like my favorite. They were all super. You know, I shirt that's like 14 years old. The super comfy.
[01:50:00] Yeah, I know the air. You're the comfort. The comfort kind of story. Come on. A t shirt that's 20 years
[01:50:05] old is more comfortable than a t-shirt that's brand new. Correct? Yes. Okay. So I had a whole series of
[01:50:10] tank tops like that all super comfortable. My wife threw them all the way. I've been complaining.
[01:50:16] The one thing is my wife complains about me is that when something happens, like this,
[01:50:22] I hold it against her forever. Yeah. I still will bring it up. Like, you know, it's been hot lately.
[01:50:26] Yes. You know, they're there. I'm like, oh, she's like, I can't believe how hot it is. I mean,
[01:50:30] like, I've been nice fed some tank tops. But it's all right. Yeah. Yeah. Some of the cool.
[01:50:36] So okay. Tank tops. Yeah. I need to go. What are you going? Back in the game with the tank
[01:50:40] tops. Come at you. To answer your question, our tank tops. What do you say in fashion? Yeah, because
[01:50:45] when I think tank tops, I also think like 80s dude, right? Which is pretty much what I was.
[01:50:53] And probably still am. But you're just throwing like a question out there to make sure I'm not
[01:50:57] out of line with it. Yeah. You know what though? I think tank tops. Like, remember the pants that
[01:51:03] I figured they were called, but like the bodybuilders were those pants that were kind of like an elastic.
[01:51:07] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, I don't want, if that's the equivalent right now,
[01:51:14] maybe I don't know if you're all out like that. I mean, if those pants were like, Funk, but they
[01:51:22] were super not functional. Yeah. I don't, I mean, functional for what? What, I want to know what
[01:51:27] those pants were called. What do you think they were actually called? I think that a name. Yeah. I think so.
[01:51:33] I don't know what they're called. I know, and this is a different type of pants, but you remember
[01:51:37] the MC Hammer pants? Yeah. Those are slightly different similar. Yeah. The bodybuilding ones
[01:51:43] with the print on them. Yeah. They're kind of like, they're kind of like, they're kind of like,
[01:51:46] the aluminum. Yeah. Balloony, but tight at the ankles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're keeping
[01:51:49] her. I actually never had a pair of those. Thank God. I could see that. Yeah. That's a kind of thing.
[01:51:53] Or it's like a picture that surfaces on the internet. You're like, damn. Yeah. That's old school.
[01:51:58] Yeah. It's retro. Actually, you know, they bring it down. Maybe it's coming back. Maybe.
[01:52:02] I don't know. Maybe. All right. Or maybe. All right. Or maybe.
[01:52:05] No, no, no. Tinctops of the they're in. Okay. They'll never cool out because he
[01:52:08] ends up this too. They're not functional. They're like cooler. They're not as hot. Yes.
[01:52:13] So we're down with them. They agree. So boom. We got that. Get on if you want to represent
[01:52:18] jockelstore.com. So we do it. We're going to stuff on there too. By the way, if it actually
[01:52:22] was said that already, but can't overstate it. Something. Actually, buddy, you actually can't
[01:52:28] overstate a lot of things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. We're down. Yeah. That's sort of like part of your
[01:52:34] thing, I guess. Mm. Like, you know, tank tops and overseating stuff.

[01:53:20] and we get great feedback. Yeah. People are digging it. Yeah. I'm digging it. You're digging it. Good
[01:53:25] one for teachers too. Yeah. But which is, you know, obviously that fits the category of
[01:53:29] having children. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Also YouTube. Uh, you can get warrior kid videos on YouTube.
[01:53:35] And you can get the jockel podcast videos on YouTube. And Echo's actually been stepping up as game
[01:53:41] big time. So am I active? Yeah. Send my active. I guess that's a step up. You said I acted about
[01:53:47] and he makes not only the videos of this podcast, but he also makes enhanced ones with lots of
[01:53:54] graphics. You need to let him know. Sometimes maybe he's brushing up against going too crazy. Right?
[01:54:00] Yes. It's we've been talking about it. Yeah. If too many things explode, I mean, let's face it.
[01:54:06] There's a lot of movies out there. What are those movies? What's the most, the best one?
[01:54:13] Commando. Okay. So there. Commando has just, no, you gotta go with a more modern one. There's
[01:54:18] more CGI and just everything's blown up. Oh. Dang. I watched one on the other day with my nine
[01:54:24] year old daughter. Everything blew up. Everything was on fire. Everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:54:28] Yeah. Yeah. We started to seem like it was one of your videos.
[01:54:30] All right. There you go. There you go. You got that new tool. The only video that's I think is
[01:54:39] truly brushed up against it. You've made. I don't think you're cross-aligned, but the war path video.
[01:54:44] You were brushing up against everything that I did exploded and turned to dust and caught
[01:54:49] on fire. You were on the war path. You were on the war path in the video. It was thematic.
[01:54:54] Yeah. And it happened to be Christmas time at the time for the original. No red still on there.
[01:55:00] So there's that nonetheless. Yeah. You can go to the wrong YouTube. Yes. videos.
[01:55:05] Also, when we're working out, just got rings. I told you that. Yeah. They just came in.
[01:55:09] Boom. Really nice ones too. You can't do muscle ups though, because you're on.
[01:55:12] Not right now. No. But here's the thing, but I never cut into muscle ups. That's wrong. So I've
[01:55:18] attempted muscle ups and I've seen that there's a technique to muscle ups. Like you've seen it.
[01:55:23] Yes. Yeah. So I've never had the pleasure of doing a muscle up. Ever. Never done a muscle up.
[01:55:33] Rings bar nothing. So my arm heals. Fully. You're going to keep a muscle up. I'm doing
[01:55:40] muscle up. That's my whole thing. I'm going to be one of my things. Also, a pistol squat.
[01:55:46] Okay. So I've done pistol squats before. Really hard. Really clunky, really ugly, even.
[01:55:50] But the next call you out on that one day. In. Like while we were doing the podcast,
[01:55:55] I like after the podcast, I was like, oh, pistol. Yeah. And then I was like, well, let's get.
[01:56:00] Yeah. You're not as flexible. Are you? No, no, no. I am. Remember, you were like,
[01:56:04] I am very flexible. Oh, okay. In my knees in my ankle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We really got a lot of room to move around.
[01:56:24] Oh, I did. Yeah. I said, please. Yeah. They got rough. Yeah. Yeah. Just so. So side splittingly fun.
[01:56:31] Anyway, very flexible. I'm going to do pistol squats and muscle ups. Watch.
[01:56:35] And be really good at it. Nonetheless, my point is, I got my rings. Anyway, my actually
[01:56:41] mid point is we're talking about on it. So you go to on it.com slash chocolate. This is where
[01:56:46] I have been getting outstanding workout gear that deviates from my normal dumbbells. You know,
[01:56:54] whatever. So I got turned on the kettlebells. All this good stuff. They have some good stuff.
[01:56:59] The bag. You know, like the, I don't think it's a bulk Gary in bag. You know, a bulk
[01:57:04] Gary in bag. I have the big same bag thing from on it. Okay. So how big is your sand bag?
[01:57:09] Bigger than yours. Well, I don't have one. Oh, okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, there's just one size. I
[01:57:15] think from on it. Okay. Yeah. But then you can you fill it up. Yeah, right? But did like how much
[01:57:22] this is for sure. I have no idea. No, no, go away. Tell me. Okay. Just so I can fill up.
[01:57:26] Put an extra pound in there. Cool. But I've been doing that. The farmer's carry. Yeah.
[01:57:32] I mean, my arm can't sustain too much weight. But it's solid. Yeah. It's a solid. I go around.
[01:57:38] I, if I went around the block through the day with my 106s, two of them. Yeah.
[01:57:42] One, it won't want any chance. Yeah. And like, I just like, okay, you know, it's definitely
[01:57:46] challenging. It takes it. And I have to set them down a couple times during that lap. But what I noticed
[01:57:52] was the next day, like my entire, my entire like traps, net shoulders, everything and for us. We're all
[01:58:00] sore. Yeah. So I mean, I had that in the routine. I was doing it pretty regular. I like to see how far
[01:58:06] I can get. Yeah. He's done my anyways. It's really good. Just for your body. Yeah. Like strength. How far
[01:58:12] is your block? I don't know. More than, well, block is about what you can't do. Yeah. Because it blocks
[01:58:21] from the same side. Yeah. I think he like city block downtown. Turned Eagles. Yeah. It's different.
[01:58:25] Wait a minute. Nonetheless, anyway, on a dot com slash juckled, really cool stuff on their
[01:58:29] cool info as well. Don't, you can get stuck on that website because it's a lot of cool stuff on
[01:58:34] there. Also psychological warfare. It's an album with tracks. A lot of people ask for a
[01:58:39] alarm system. This is kind of an alarm that you can put in your phone and it's me talking
[01:58:43] about times that you might want to slack off. This will not allow any slack psychological warfare.
[01:58:49] It's on iTunes, Google Play, etc. Jack. It's a good one. Dang. It was pretty concise. Yeah. And
[01:58:55] effective because that is what it is. Also, juckled like tea. Yeah. I got, so the tea, I'm into the
[01:59:05] cans, not into the brewing. Jay Peas. Sorry, bro. Jay Peas. I think JP might have a problem.
[01:59:11] JP's all about it. Actually, okay. So let me ask you this. It has a little bit of caffeine. And what's good
[01:59:16] is that JP, JP, my brother, that boy can drink some dang energy drinks like crazy. Like, like,
[01:59:27] where I should have as a friend been like a JP. I think he talked to you. Like, he said, he
[01:59:33] re-have. We need to get you off these things. Because he would pound that stuff. You know, because
[01:59:37] he's going hard. He's, you know, JP's getting after it. And so it's like, okay, cool. I'll just
[01:59:43] drink, drink energy drinks. And also now he's on, he's drinking a chocolate tea. And so that's
[01:59:50] real positive. It's a good replacement for that crap. He's just pounding. Yeah. Yeah. I,
[01:59:55] but he still owe me like a crackhead. Like, hey, man, it's a thing. Yeah, I just got another two
[02:00:01] cases. By the way, cans. Can you give it to little kid like, being not babies? There's caffeine in it,
[02:00:06] bro. That, yeah. That's what I give it to little kids. Yeah, because my son grabs,
[02:00:10] and grabs. What's it done with? He does lift the, oh, he's doing it. He's a little kid.
[02:00:17] Nonetheless, yes, very good. Ooh, another thing that happens to taste really, really good from
[02:00:22] Jockel, Jockel's into the little tasting good thing. Nonetheless, Jockel, why do you really go to
[02:00:27] organic certified? Yeah. By the way, so get down with it. Yeah. It's good to wait. You know,
[02:00:32] right now it's on Amazon. And we're going to expand that. We got it in Canada. So on Jockel's
[02:00:38] store too, by the way. I want to say Australia. Get some Jocquatino Australia. We're going to go England.
[02:00:43] So anyways, well, the store ships everywhere look like are the shipping from the store. He's people. I
[02:00:50] hate when people say like, hey, man, what's up with your shipping? Yeah, I know. I don't, I'd rather
[02:00:55] you just don't buy it. You know, you're buying whatever wait till we get it to your country.
[02:01:02] Yeah. Well, we haven't in your country. We got in Canada. We got it in England. We got on Australia.
[02:01:06] Yeah. Jocquatino. Well, here's the thing in the channel. Shipping from the store can get
[02:01:11] challenge it because we're paying what they're kind of charging us for though. It's like a whole
[02:01:15] thing. Then we're working on just slowly and slowly. Yeah. Shipping more. You know, plus the
[02:01:21] the the the bigger we get. Yes. Then we get the economy of scales. Yes. And so that's it makes
[02:01:28] stuff. She's so appreciate that. Some more on our way. Because one day you're going to be able to buy
[02:01:33] Jocquatino everywhere you go. You might just be coming out of your drinking fountain too.
[02:01:38] It's like, oh, yeah. I'm going to. Yeah. I'm going to get a stronger thing. Yeah. I wrote some books.
[02:01:46] One of them is called the way the warrior kid. One of them is a follow up of that book series called
[02:01:52] Way the Warrior Kid Marks Mission. Those books will help your kid. I promise. How's that?
[02:01:58] Yeah. Should I do that? I think I think you can do that. Yes. I've got I've not had anyone say,
[02:02:05] hey, my kid read that book and didn't like it and has now said that they want to get weaker.
[02:02:11] Yeah. That's not happening. Hey, this does not help. Yeah. So, way the warrior kid books
[02:02:16] get them for whoever. Whatever kid you know, whatever family get them for your library, get them for whoever.
[02:02:22] It's like it's like a good way to help man. It's a good way to help. Also got a book called
[02:02:29] Desperning Coast Freedom Field Management. I just said someone has wrote on Twitter that that's the
[02:02:32] best book they've ever read. No, no frame of reference might be the only book he's ever read.
[02:02:39] But unless I will say this, the field manual, if you crack that thing open,
[02:02:46] then you take a little look. It'll reset. Your, your, your, your compass a little bit. Really will.
[02:02:52] It resets my, I wrote the book and I still get my compass reset when I look at it. So it's a good book
[02:02:57] to get for people that are sort of like maybe they're a little bit. They're, they're somewhere, right?
[02:03:04] They're not really going in the right direction. Oh, they're not going in the right direction.
[02:03:08] As horn as they should be. Boom. Yeah. It doesn't matter. You're someone that's like completely
[02:03:12] off the path like on the slippery slope. You're in the, in the, was that place you called one time like
[02:03:18] the, the weed? Yeah. No, no, yeah. We do, you do someone from a movie that you saw, which is a lot
[02:03:26] of movies. Some place of misery swamps the sadness during the swamp. Maybe someone's something
[02:03:33] sort of getting in the book. But you get someone that's like not in the swamp, but that's actually
[02:03:36] on the path they want to get further on the path getting that book right there. I really like how you
[02:03:39] swamps the sadness. Yeah. That makes me feel very good. He's a references via you. So that's
[02:03:44] discipline. It goes freedom. The field manual. It's not a normal book. No, it's not a normal book.
[02:03:52] Extreme ownership. That's the first book I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.
[02:03:56] And that book is about leadership. It's about the combat leadership principles we learned
[02:04:00] on the battlefield and how you can apply them to everything that you do. Now we got a follow-up book
[02:04:05] to that called the dichotomy leadership. The follow-up book to that is actually chapter 12 of
[02:04:10] extreme ownership talks about the dichotomy leadership. And that's balancing these opposing forces
[02:04:15] and we realized through echelon front our consulting company that the biggest problem people have
[02:04:22] is that they have a hard time staying balanced as a leader. So we wrote a whole book about it
[02:04:27] so that people can dial in and get granular and that's the dichotomy leadership.
[02:04:32] We're getting awesome feedback on it. We're better writers now than we are then. I mean,
[02:04:39] here's the three years. I've been reading and writing of non-stop and so we're better.
[02:04:47] And so yeah, that's that. That comes out September 25th. If you want the first edition,
[02:04:55] you got to order it now. Someone said that they're ordering it now so that they get the first
[02:05:02] edition so that when they meet me and I sign it, they're not like holding their head down and saying
[02:05:08] someone else said, hey, oh, I guess I'm a bad guy because I gave away my first edition of
[02:05:14] extreme ownership. You're not a bad guy. You just made a mistake. Get somebody else. The third edition,
[02:05:20] the fifth edition. You don't care about that. You only want a desk. You only get one crack at the
[02:05:24] title or they're very, very noble. You know, we copies of the extreme of about face I have.
[02:05:29] I'm going to count them. I don't know, but I got a lot. Okay. Always in the hunt for that first edition.
[02:05:34] Got a couple of them. Got you. Got you. So anyways, that's that. Also, I just mentioned
[02:05:43] echelon front. That is our leadership and management consulting company. It's me,
[02:05:48] Lave Babin, JP Nell, Dave Burke, Flynn Cockrant and also Mike Surrely, who is just on the podcast
[02:05:53] 134 awesome podcast, awesome to talk to Mike, awesome to be working with Mike again. And what we do is
[02:06:01] we solve problems through leadership period. That's what we do. Mustard 006 in San Francisco,
[02:06:07] California, October 17th and 18th. It's going to sell out. I would get in close, but
[02:06:16] yeah, register an extreme ownership.com. Every mustard we've done has sold out this in the 6 one.
[02:06:21] Also, this is an important one for current military law enforcement, border patrol,
[02:06:28] firefighters, Paramax, everyone. All you first responders out there. We've got a one day
[02:06:33] leadership seminar in Texas Dallas, Texas September 21st. We did this because we wanted to do something
[02:06:42] shorter and focused so that more people in uniform could get to it. And it's a cheaper price
[02:06:47] point than the master. So if you're in one of those types of organizations, come to the roll call.
[02:06:53] And it's, but it is a master. It's a mini-muster. Would you say that? It's not really a mini-muster.
[02:06:58] It's a, it's, they're both leadership training, right? But this one is completely focused on
[02:07:02] these dynamic environments, whereas the master's talking about talks about a broader leadership,
[02:07:08] a little bit broader, not so focused. I shouldn't say not so focused. This one is specific. It's
[02:07:13] true. The dynamic environments. Yeah. And we can focus a little bit more on it. The challenges
[02:07:18] are, we can address the challenges that those leaders have in those dynamic environments. As
[02:07:24] opposed to the master where we address, that one is definitely the master is more focused on
[02:07:28] business leadership. Even though we get all types of leaders and we do get military law enforcement
[02:07:32] there, it's focused on business leadership more. This one is you focus. And like, and I just got
[02:07:37] back, I mean, it's worked with the Arizona Highway Patrol and just being out there. You know,
[02:07:44] you just, you hear that it's leadership. And the better you are as a leader, the better your
[02:07:48] team's going to be, the more prepared you're going to be for bad situations. And we, you know,
[02:07:53] echelon front does this. We work with fire departments. We work with police departments.
[02:07:57] And we know that not every department can bring us in. So that's why we do this. That's why
[02:08:02] we decided to do this roll call. So people could come to it and get the training concentrated
[02:08:07] one day. So they're better prepared to do their jobs on the beat, on the battlefield, wherever they
[02:08:13] are. All right. And lastly, we have the Overwatch EF Overwatch, which is where we are connecting
[02:08:23] special operations that's combat aviation that's with companies that need solid leaders. You can
[02:08:31] go to EF Overwatch.com to get in the game on that. And if you want to spend some time with us virtually,
[02:08:41] virtually in the virtual world until we see each other live at the master in San Francisco,
[02:08:46] where we see each other live at the roll call in Texas or live at the immersion camp in Maine,
[02:08:51] then you can find us on the in-rewebs on Twitter, on Instagram. And of course on that defaes.
[02:08:57] Oh, I was at Eko Charles and I am at Jocco Willink and as always to those of you out there in
[02:09:06] uniform that are protecting us here in a broad that's a military law enforcement firefighter
[02:09:11] sport of patrol paramedics, other first responders without you, the world falls apart. So thank you
[02:09:17] for what you do and thanks to everyone for listening. Thanks to everyone for supporting. I know that
[02:09:22] this podcast is not always the most uplifting thing to listen to. I know it gets heavy. I know it
[02:09:31] gets dark just like life does, but I definitely don't want you to dwell in the darkness. I don't
[02:09:39] dwell there, but as I've said before, I do think that we need to know the darkness so that we can
[02:09:48] steer our lives in the right direction away from it, toward the good and toward the light.
