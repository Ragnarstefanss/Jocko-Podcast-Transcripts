well what is the threat the threat is depression the threat is loneliness the threat is helplessness the threat is feeling like there's no way out and being aware of those threats is what allows recognition of the enemy so that you can fight them so i think you got to talk about this with your guys i think that they will become aware of what they need to look out for in others and in themselves so they can alert the platoon that you know joy if you guys talk to johnny man he seems you know johnny seems a little off right now we should check in on him we should talk to him or self recognition man i'm feeling like depressed about something i'm feeling dark it doesn't i don't know what i'm gonna do right and on that last podcast that we did i read a couple excerpts in words from some various combat veterans and i touched on the fact that several of them from different times from different wars had written the same thing and they wrote basically that death would be liberating and that it would be an escape from the hell of war from the memories of war and and i should have hit on that harger because i i think that what that means to me what that tells me is that is that having those thoughts doesn't necessarily mean that there's something wrong with you right it doesn't necessarily mean that you're losing it these you know the the writings that i'm talking about the book and the writing from a guy that i knew doesn't mean that you're losing it and i think that people think to themselves no I'm not ready to know I think we all want it to know next question juggle what's your take on false motivation versus authentic leadership okay false motivation versus authentic leadership and others two kind of two kind of ways of understanding this question the first is from like a really heavy leadership perspective and that is of trying to lead without actually believing in what you're doing and that's leading without understanding why and not believing in what you're doing and that's wrong right and this is an extreme ownership of course and we talk about on the podcast you can't do it if you don't believe in what you're doing your team is going to see that and they won't believe in it either which means they're not going to go above and beyond to accomplish the mission period so you got to believe what you're doing and if you don't believe it then you got to ask the question up the chain of command find out why understand why so you believe in what you're doing and eventually you're going to get the answer right eventually you're going to understand why you're doing something you're going to believe in it or you're going to you're going to convince the chain of command that that's not a good method then you need to go a different direction and there might be some rare in extremist case where you actually don't you know but I'm like the kid the you know the teenager gets their driver's license and the two types of kids there's the one kid who the dad's like hey you got to learn to walk before you can fly so you got to like I don't know I'll make the down payment you make the payments that's what my dad just said or you make the down payment or whatever you know like you got to work for this first car and it might not be the you know the BMW whatever then there's the other kid who rolls right into the BMW you know so we're going to move in that direction so from a high level false motivation doesn't work if you don't believe in something it's not going to work out for you now from a micro level from like a front line level and the buds and structures used to joke about this that false motivation is better than no motivation have you heard that is that a common expression false motivation is better than no motivation and we don't want that to be true right because we want motivation to be this pure golden thing that fuels performance but the fact the matter is and of course we talk about all this all the time motivation doesn't hold up right motivation doesn't how many motivated people motivated people motivated people didn't make it through seal training a ton of them they're all motivated you how many of them did it make you training a ton how many motivated people do you see that don't accomplish their goals that they have right the world is full full of those people there's a ton of those people and that's because motivation doesn't hold you up we all know this it's discipline that holds you up it's discipline that gets things going and it's discipline that gets you through things but this is an interesting little spin if you have the discipline to press on why don't have a little fun with it all right well first of all you got to become a buffer between your boss and your team that's what you need to do um trying to absorb as much negativity as you can and make sure you don't spread that negativity right this and also this is a delicate situation that we've talked about before if you completely support the boss and and and act like the boss is the greatest person in the world the team is going to reject you or there's a like a high likelihood that they're going to reject you at the same time if you completely reject the boss then you've actually aided in dividing the team because now the team is not aligned with the boss so you have to balance you have to balance us in one of the best ways to do this is to put listen that's you got to put the importance of the mission and the team above the ego's an attitude so here's I'm gonna say something like look guys look guys I know we have our differences with the chain of command on some things I agree with there thousand million people you consistent right even like small little things like for my doctor for example it's the routine is when it's time to go to bed it's brush teeth we do stories and questions which is like just you know some stories that I mean and then questions like basically a quiz it's like rudimentary education like solar system stuff yeah the y'all that's you know the younger days for sure every guy goes through that and that's what that's what's hard and you know what I'm saying guys specifically but the girls are the same way both guys and girls go through these horrible breakups when you and and this is the other thing that we got to realize as parents when you're 16 years old we you know I look at my 15 16 17 year old daughters right as they were grown up and and I think oh they got a boyfriend whatever he'll be it's this guy is meaningless in their lives I factually know that these guys are meaningless in terms of the broad spectrum of their life but I think you still gotta do it you still gotta make the decision you gotta like because in a way I'm in the same boat as your second scenario there like if she's out of there so I'm gonna do that I'm just gonna name my secondary restaurant all right there you go maybe she'll say yes maybe she'll say no well that gotta be my default now though step up the lead you know what I you know what I gotta do it's better to win despite them so despite we we got some rough leadership it's okay and the other thing is you know even when you're doing that with a bad leader you still got to be careful that step in the leaders toes and the way you do that is really easy you give them all the credit you give them all the credit and that's great and that little nagging voice that you got in the back your head that wants credit you know that one I'm talking about that you go back there don't worry about that I'm telling you right now you will get the credit in the long run you will get the credit don't worry about it you might not get the credit on this one or even this week this month maybe not even this year but eventually you will get the credit and recognition that you deserve that you want because your boss's boss he knows what's up he knows what's up and your troops know what's up and so when everybody knows what's up when you have a truly bad leader the truly bad leader doesn't they're not they're not just walking around fooling everyone in an organization it's not happening it's not happening and if it does happen it doesn't happen for long it only happens there's a limited time that it can happen for because every every idiotic move that that leader makes down the chain of command at least one out of every five he does some stupid up the chain of command too and so how is that group performance yeah it really plays a factor first sure and not to say that you'll be able to necessarily tap the guy out but him trying to tap you out when you have strength conditioning and size it's like it just gets real hard no for sure and unless you will be the key component there that you mentioned is that I have to have similar because you can be a 235 pound like guy super strong athlete and if you don't know jjitsu Jeff Glover's gonna wrap you up like you don't even know what's happening he's It's so hard to end with so many times you know because when I was a system to a commander a two-in-commander task commander what I was doing right but more in the earlier phases right because once I was you know a task you're a commander I was dealing with a lot less those those problems that would come to me on a relationship level would be something big you know divorce custody of children some kind of domestic violent scenario like real things but when I was younger and I was in a seal platoon that's when you're dealing with guys going through the breakup with the girl and that you know the method with my head man but a lot of times the pain that we feel isn't based on the reality it's based on the fantasy so you're feeling pain of losing something that wasn't real so let the fantasy go remember that she is not the perfect person that you built in your mind period she's not otherwise we wouldn't be in this situation right now and then move on brother get after it work out train hard go to the kitchen to hike run a blanket hard just get after it and those things not only are you going to distract you from the pain which is good they're going to improve you as a human being which is good and they're going to rebuild your confidence which is good they're going to make you feel good they're going to make you stronger and smarter and better and put you into a place where you don't need that little made up fantasy anymore and they're going to put you into place where you're going to find something better than the fantasy now i'm going to tell you right now the fantasies don't exist the perfect girl or guy for you doesn't exist they don't exist so you're going to be out looking for someone that's good so like you don't so when you get like tired or sleepy whatever it's really easy to just fall asleep super easy and that's hard because you can't control it it's like you think you can just I can control it and sure there is little tactics like you can like hard to do little things that you know and yeah it's not going to help you and you did to if you're focused on something that's not important and to know what's important and what's not is very important has a leader as a parent and is on the duty to play or match yes of justice and very hard by the way it takes like a lot of experience so you consider these guys who are like if you do a light role with a really really high level guy that's when you can start to see okay this guy really thinks that this arm position is really important because he'll fight till the death to kind of maintain it you know that reinforcement you know you know you know how like you're like man I really have I have in this issue with myself whatever like I'm gonna I'm gonna ask Jocco only because it's really I'm really confused not confused and that's kind of part of what I mean case so that you know the the mats I don't know if you noticed I brought the mats in there so those mats there I think just like 16 of them I forget how many but they cover a two full two car garage cover is it perfect it's a lot of mats and the two inch thick ones so to move them you know up you know the topography is that even so you had so you had like some legit challenge like no I don't need help no I don't you know because I'm trying to be like jockel you know fucking hard core I don't need help little kids can hurt me they can make me complete you know it's like that mindset but I've created false motivation for myself I said you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna do this actually it's the way for me to facilitate discipline for myself is I want to do this because I'm gonna feel better afterwards you know that whole deal you're talking about discipline then you contrast it with how junk I'm gonna feel if I don't weak embarrassed for myself by the way and when I said that you know how workout has many opportunities to stop I think I made this analogy before you know in the aircraft right pre take off they go through the safety instructions in the event of cabin pressure loss yeah oxygen tank mask comes down put on yourself before you can all that I mean that's a good kind of thing where you support yourself then you can help support others so support yourself this is how with supplementation like it and again I'll say this again I'll say it every day if I am compelled if I motivated to inspire you the way I'm now into supplements not a bunch but before I was like no supplements you just get good nutrition anyway so real oil so I don't know at some point in my childhood false motivation turned into like an actual fuel and just just regular motivation maybe it's because I realized that I wasn't counting on it to get me through things I was just having fun with it rock and roll do you think also how you know how you like you'd always say that you're kind of into just being hardcore even if like normal stuff or the culture shifts man like there's certain things that's even I mean back to your thing with the short shorts that's I mean pointy is a little bit different but you have to contend with yeah cultural history that's a new reality for me like in in Hawaii for example when I grew up like just the swimsuits um we're you know sure you wear bikini I'm gonna make it or whatever that's what she wants and really those little this those that situation comes up all the time that's a good point just like you know the old that the joe actually that's kind of like a joke you know when you ask a girl when it goes as or when you ask a girl hey when you want to eat but I'm kind of tired right now and then almost like you just it was painful to let the words out of your mouth you know like you let them slip in it really hurt you so it was like maybe like three seconds later you said that was my little hypothesis I think it's true though because think about like think about just the environment of the the consistent environment that you kind of that it someone will come from they always in a way sort of for lack of better to create recreate that environment or try to when they leave so like you know how like kids they come from a chaotic people yell out and they they turned to dust you know that's what you want to your exposums you can get the professional help and get things under control so that's the leadership be straightforward with your troops tell them the truth explained the enemy threat that's what we're talking about and how you as a platoon are going to look out for it and then obviously you got to grieve the loss you got to mourn your fallen comrades and then you also have to get back to work get back to soldiering get back to preparing for the enemy that you will face on the battlefield with with a new awareness that there's a another enemy that can lurk inside lupiltoon and inside the individual and that you have to protect each other just like you protect each other from a real enemy so that would probably be the route that I would go good luck brother with that sis uh it's a hard one for sure next question juggle my leader is not an extreme ownership disciple among other things he's fostering division within our team how do I help lead those who no longer trust in the commander but are awesome guys who want to stay involved how do I bring them back into the fold without threatening our lead or our dear leader but that has to it that this doesn't mean include rolling like we're gonna go roll however it works out it means rolling with some kind of structure around it so you get your short rounds you got to get your long rounds you got to get your shark tanks you got to get your positional drilling you got to get your consequence free drills like Dean Lister makes us do consequence free drills where you're gonna start in a position where you might get tapped out but it doesn't matter all right right hey good job you're 50 now big big big time of your life time in your life whatever here's a dope car congratulations love you son you know then there's that guy that's kind of who I am with the kettlebells you know I didn't like pay my dues you know when the kettlebells were new and all the way to it yeah if you don't know jjitsu 245 pound muscle head going against Jeff Glover you're getting tapped out you do know jjitsu there he is yeah for sure there is a video I think is crappler's quest I think it's still online right now Jeff Glover goes against this huge guy because yeah you have all this experience but you know how like how we always talk about like when you lock up with someone you know you can get a really good idea of what they're about to bring to you yeah that is what it is it's a spot so just like false motivation that can be just like a spot like you can't roll into the gym with your workout partner and be like hey well then yeah people go to the other but if you just said if you just kind of backed away from a moment people people might have realized it but anyways regardless of that you probably guess what I'm going to say then what you're going to do is I want it right you got to own it so when the opportunity presents itself to explain what happened and what went wrong and what you did wrong right not making excuses but explain where you were weak you know there's just a ton you know as I was going through these I don't remember where I let read the you know I don't remember where I read this letter for the first time from Milata or a kova but there's so much good stuff in there chose your friends carefully I mean just just when she's kicking it off you know life is hard it does not pamper anybody that's a good thing for kids to understand yeah it's face it 45 47 pounds top of a couch atomic knee drop both knees by the way all the way you know the last city all that stuff hurt by the normal standard of things so the typical mindset I think would be like don't do that especially the shock and all this stuff but default is just like but you know I'm really I need the answer I don't have the I'm really want to I'm gonna ask Jocco and you can be texting Jocco the answer or the question and you're like I know that answer like as I'm reading this question to Jocco it kind of fits into it but I want it to be my default is why you know like yours is like your default like you know all this will do it yeah the week words and the week and the and the actual subjects are weak inspiration all right the vacation like it's not gonna get you there come on it might get you through like the first three minutes of a you know yeah so learn that is that why you wear the same clothes every day you know I wear the same because fashion is not important it's not important to me those short rounds are good when you do short rounds in jiu jitsu and they kind of trick you too because like Jeff will do that he'll be like three minute rounds but what the bad just back to the girl real quick the girl situation when you lock up with someone's strengthwise you know you feel like I said you what they're about to bring so again and when you have the more experience you have the more you're gonna know with like more accuracy and that's what you but you have been like that where you think like yes I'm gonna feel like oh this this is gonna be stiff or this is gonna be heard of what I but you know nonetheless the the shirts are still available there if you like the shirts you like the designs get some I'm not saying just hey guys support by buying shirts I'm not saying that not saying that at all I'm saying go to the website jacco store dot com check them out if you like them get them support that way that's all oh my god twice one time it felt real good because I justified it very effectively in the second time I was like I just got to get after it tomorrow whatever nonetheless then then it's after the first body part or the first sort of you know you have I'm gonna do you know well my I think the key is here what you can't do is just trying to push them like crazy you just have to guide them and what is correct and what you have to really show is like the benefits of why it's good to keep things in order you know if you're gonna spend an hour looking for your car keys just think of your productivity at that point it's and then you you know I listen to it listen to the three minutes or whatever it's like a good little reminder it's like a refresher and that's not to mention let's say if I totally forgot it you know
