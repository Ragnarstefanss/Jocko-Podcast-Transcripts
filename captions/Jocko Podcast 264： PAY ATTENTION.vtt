00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50
This is Jocco podcast number 264 with Echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening Echo.

2
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:12.000
Good evening. And also joining us tonight is Dave Burke, Good evening Dave. Good evening.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So why is Dave Burke joining us? Well, there could be a multitude of reasons, but one of my favorite reasons is when the Marine Corps releases a new doctrinal publication, which they just did, it came out on December 16th, 2020.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And as soon as it came out, I sent Dave a text and said, hey, there's a new pub out and he texted me back and tell me when we were recording a podcast on it. So here we are.

5
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now you're going to see, as we dive into this, that if you know the way broadly you see it and all things.

6
00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And there was a subcontext of this manual that came to my mind almost as soon as I started reading it, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.

7
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And it took me about 10 pages deep before I realized what this thing was floating around in my head.

8
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And then what I was seeing underneath the surface, which this publication Marine Corps, doctrinal publication, one tack for the title of it is competing.

9
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But there's something just underneath the surface of competing that I saw throughout.

10
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And I saw it almost immediately, but it took me as took me a little longer than I would have liked to identify, which is a bummer, but it happened.

11
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So what was I seeing underneath competing, what I was seeing was influencing.

12
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And as soon as I identified that correlation, I kept seeing it and we'll share it with you today, not just the aspects of competing with others.

13
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And I'll follow this continuum of competition reflects the continuum of influence.

14
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And of course, if you better understand both of them, you will be able to do both of these things better.

15
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You'll not only get better at competing against your enemy or against your rival, but you'll also become better at leading, leading the teammates you have inside your own organization.

16
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So with that, let's get to it.

17
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The Marine Corps, doctrinal publication, one tack for competing.

18
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And it starts off where they forward.

19
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And in the forward, it says this, Western conceptions of the international struggle among nations and other political actors often use binary, war or peace labels to describe it.

20
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The actual truth is more complicated. So out of the gate, we're already getting somewhere.

21
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Out of the gate, we have to recognize that you can be competing with someone, but you're not at war with them.

22
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And there's an infinite degree of gray area in there. And guess what?

23
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Right out of the gate. That's what struck me right out of the gate. Guess what? When you're influencing someone, there's a whole degree of levels of pressure.

24
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But you can exert to go from influencing. Because let's face it. If I put a gun to your head, is that influence? Yes. Yes, it is.

25
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So influence and competing very, very similar, continuing on.

26
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Actors on the world stage are always trying to create a relative advantage for themselves and for their group.

27
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Sometimes this maneuvering leads to violence.

28
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But the use of violence to achieve goals is more often the exception than the rule.

29
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Now, here's where this again. If I'm trying to influence echo Charles, there's levels of influence.

30
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Could one of those levels be a double leg takedown and ground in power? Yes, it could.

31
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
How often does that happen? I mean, how often do people physically fight? Not very often.

32
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
When you think of all the human interactions that we have, we were trying to influence each other or trying to compete with each other.

33
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
See, it's a weird thing though, because on the one side you got competition and on the other side you got influence.

34
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And the continuum of how you apply these pressures are all over the place.

35
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So it continues on instead most actors use other means in their competitive interactions, right? To achieve their goals.

36
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So look at it, go to war. The competition continuum encompasses all of these efforts, including the use of violence.

37
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Okay, so there you go.

38
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Continue is on and by the way, this idea of competitive interactions and influence interactions, this is what's happening.

39
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Right, when we're interacting, so many of the interactions that we have with people are either competitive or their influence.

40
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Right, we're constantly trying to get someone to do something, get someone to come on our side, get someone to give us the support that we need.

41
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Get them to move in this direction. That's what people are doing.

42
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Continuing on, there are several reasons for explaining the competition continuum to Marines.

43
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The first is to make them aware that from recruitment to retirement, they are an integral part of the nation's strategic competition with other actors.

44
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Marines are always competing even when they are not fighting in combat.

45
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So this is something to think about as a person, as a leader, as a leader you're always influencing.

46
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Even when you're not standing up in front of the troops, giving a speech about where you're going or what the strategic knew.

47
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Even then, even when you're sitting down to each child, guess what you're doing, you're influencing.

48
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
You're competing. This is always happening.

49
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Then it rolls into this.

50
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:24.000
When you understand those things, it says next, understanding unleashes creativity.

51
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:36.000
The Marine card coming out to you with unleashing creativity. When you go to art school, do you think they say, well listen, the goal of this art school is to get you to unleash your creativity.

52
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
No, the Marine court will say that.

53
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000
That isn't it interesting. We're two paragraphs in and we're talking about the creative aspects of competition.

54
00:06:46.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And then hand in hand with that, the creative aspects of influence. Curring on. Once Marines understand the nature and form of competition, their innovative spirit will lead to the development of new kinds of competition, go new kinds of competitive advantages.

55
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Finally, this publication expands the discussion on how and where Marines fit into the continuum and where to look for their natural partners in competition.

56
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:24.000
By design, this is a small book. With a construction that parallels Marine court, doctrinal publication, one, war fighting, which is one of the first publications we covered on this podcast.

57
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It is not intended as a reference manual, but it is designed to be read from cover to cover.

58
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
This publication does not contain specific techniques or procedures we should adopt.

59
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:48.000
But rather it provides broad guidance in the form of concepts with illustrations intended to stimulate thinking and encourage additional learning. It requires judgment in application.

60
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
This is this is the way I like to learn. This is the way I like to teach.

61
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So when I and the really easy thing to talk about is jujitsu, right? You want to be able to teach the advantage of this broad position is this.

62
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000
The thing you need to do when you're in this situation, broadly is when this underhook. Whatever whatever the thing is.

63
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And that's what this book is. It's not like, hey, here's in this situation. It's not form you like.

64
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Continuing on, we live in a time of renewed great power competition in the era of exponential technological and social change.

65
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Marines enjoy a rich heritage of advancing our nation's interest in these kinds of struggles.

66
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
As we look to the future, we must ensure today's and tomorrow's Marines do the same.

67
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Like maneuver warfare.

68
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And just that statement followed by anything kind of warms my heart. Like maneuver warfare, competing is a way of thinking.

69
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It's a way of thinking. And man, Dave, I kind of went berserk on like decentralized command as a way of thinking not too long ago.

70
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Right? I mean, I went on EF online. I would spent two or three days of the sessions talking about decentralized command as a way of thinking.

71
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And it's so interesting how much that changes your perspective about something.

72
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
When you think of it not in a linear way like, oh, this is what you're going to do, but this is the entire way of thinking.

73
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It's like saying, oh, when you fight someone, you can get them to the ground and you can grapple with them instead of punching them.

74
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:42.000
That's just a whole new way of thinking. You don't even know one single move about it, but you know this idea that you can then utilize.

75
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:52.000
We must understand the importance of strategic competition and the essential role Marines play in it for our nation.

76
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Only I missed this line. It says we all need to read study and debate this publication with our fellow Marines.

77
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
You chimed in on that one. Didn't you, Dave? Yeah. What do you like about that?

78
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I like that. I like the explanation of this. I went through the same thing initially when I was kind of looking at this. There was parts of it that I was thinking it was going to be like war fighting.

79
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But it had this kind of intellectual, this thought process thing. This idea that what he's saying, the guy in charge of the Marine Corps.

80
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You need to go out there and debate this and think about this and he's using words like creativity and intellect.

81
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Those are not the words you would normally think of when you think of the Marine Corps. Creativity, intellectual and debate. Those are just not the things you'd think of.

82
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And those are things he's saying that you need to do.

83
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And what I really like about it is we think of the Marine Corps.

84
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:49.000
We think of the military in general and then we think of the Marine Corps, of course, of being this hierarchy that is just as strict as you can imagine.

85
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Here's a document and general David H. Burger to comment on the Marine Corps is saying the purpose of this document is to make you debate.

86
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Not to not just obey what it says, but to make you debate. We want you to think.

87
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
That's a beautiful thing.

88
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So there we are. We are now done this afford.

89
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Let's get into what the book actually says.

90
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:23.000
The nature of competition chapter one total war and perfect peace rarely exist in practice.

91
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Instead, they are the extremes between which exists the relations among most political groups.

92
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:40.000
This range includes routine economic competition more or less permanent political or ideological tension and occasional crisis among groups.

93
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So what's that? That's from war fighting the Marine Corps manual number one.

94
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And by the way, these things that we're talking about tensions, competition, not violent competition, but just competition.

95
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Where do those things exist? They exist.

96
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Sure they exist between countries, but guess where else they exist?

97
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
They exist between companies and guess where else they exist between departments inside of companies and guess where they exist?

98
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Between people inside of departments inside of companies.

99
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Inside your family, there's competition going on.

100
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
These words from the Marine Corps war fighting philosophy frame the idea of competition for Marines.

101
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:34.000
They also serve as a springboard for Marines to think about how they can contribute to winning the nation's competitions, including the ones taking place below the threshold of violence.

102
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Which, by the way, is 99.99% of competitions.

103
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Violence is rare.

104
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And when we get into influence, look, it's almost cheesy for me to talk about influence of like, well, I could put, if I put a gun to your head, or I beat you with a baseball bat to get you to do what I want to do.

105
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Right? That's that's that's where four moving influence that doesn't happen all the time.

106
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
But there's a threat. There is a threshold of violence.

107
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And I think as we talk about it, and I haven't fully, I haven't fully hashed out these ideas in my head, but there's a transition time when you're influencing.

108
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
There's a transition time when you go from indirect to direct form of influence.

109
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
There's a transition that you cross.

110
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And it's not quite a threshold of violence, but there's a transition that takes place.

111
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And I think we'll find some comparisons to it in here, but I think about that all the time.

112
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
How much?

113
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
At what point do you go from indirect to direct?

114
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And it's funny we had somebody on EF online the other day.

115
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And this type of question came up.

116
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
But what I was explaining was the escalation of counseling.

117
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Right? And you start off by saying, hey, bro, are you good? You know, okay?

118
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And then it goes, like, hey, this is a problem.

119
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And then goes, hey, I'm going to write you up and then you get written up. And then you fire somebody if you have to.

120
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I think I'm sitting there talking to go, you know how many times in my life.

121
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I made it past below this level of escalation of counseling.

122
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
The times that I said, hey, Dave, it doesn't look like the gear was ready in time.

123
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And Dave was like, do, sorry, we lay it, blah, blah, blah, blah.

124
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And I never happens again. That's 97%.

125
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000
There's another 2% where it was like, hey, bro, that's the second time we almost missed our movement because the gear wasn't ready.

126
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Do you need help? No, I got it. And it never happens again.

127
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
That's another 2% now we're at 99%.

128
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
There's another point, whatever percent we're actually at a right time.

129
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000
But there's 0.0 is whatever, where I had to take, you know, action to fire somebody or get rid of them.

130
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
The same thing as you go through this escalation of war.

131
00:14:48.000 --> 00:15:02.000
You should be able to get people to do what you want them to do through non-war without breaking the threshold of violence.

132
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Continue on.

133
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Competition happens constantly in many forms amongst nations of the world and diplomatic informational military and economic arenas.

134
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Rivals often challenge each other in one of them while they cooperate in a different one.

135
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.000
No, that's good to know, isn't it? Isn't it good to know that we can be competing in one thing and cooperating in something else simultaneously?

136
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Competitors include a wide range of political actors from nation states to groups organized around a single cause.

137
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:40.000
While discussion below will often refer to state versus state rivalries, in most cases, the ideas apply equal to challenges with non-state actors.

138
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Competition in various forms among various different actors is the norm in international relations.

139
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
So that's great that they're talking about international relations and we're talking about these.

140
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I keep throwing all these percentages out today. Is that a good thing? I don't think it's a good thing.

141
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
It's a little questionable.

142
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Is anyone going to be able to check me on my 97% facts?

143
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
No.

144
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
All right.

145
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Well, I'm going to estimate that a vast majority of people that are listening to this podcast are not engaged.

146
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And a policy level with interstate rivalries.

147
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:22.000
So what's important to recognize is that everything that we're talking about doesn't only apply to this country versus that country.

148
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
It applies everywhere.

149
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Continuing on, the Marine Corps participates in the competitions of the United States in many ways.

150
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Formals among them is to fight and win our nation's battles and be ready to do so at all times.

151
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And then it says this, war itself is a special kind of competition, which is a classic line.

152
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
To say that war itself is a special kind of competition.

153
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
We salute the Marine Corps for that statement because it certainly is a special type of competition.

154
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
How it fits in the overall continuum will be exploring detail.

155
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
The very existence of the Marine Corps is a competitive act.

156
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000
As it signals to potential rivals that their vital interests, our nations will go to war to protect.

157
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And that those of a maritime nature are important enough that we have invested in a dedicated naval expeditionary force to protect them.

158
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.000
So that's a big statement and one thing that I love about this entire manual.

159
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Is this entire manual written by the Marine Corps?

160
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And I just want you to pay attention to this.

161
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And you have to know what's going on between all the different services. You've got the Army Navy Air Force Marines and Coast Guard.

162
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And all of them are in competition at all times.

163
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And not just hey, our planes are better than yours and our pilots are better not not not that complicated.

164
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
They're competing for money for money.

165
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And so I hate to do this Marine Corps because I do love the Marine Corps.

166
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
But there are so many maneuvers in this book that if you read it, you go, well, we better take care of the Marine Corps.

167
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
We better give them a little edge. That's one of those lines right there.

168
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Vital interest in our nation.

169
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Just in case you care about the ocean.

170
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Just in case you care about the ocean.

171
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Yeah, might want them Marine Corps. They get that in there.

172
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
But what's interesting about this, the very existence of the Marine Corps is a competitive act.

173
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
So how many things do you do or have or say that just being there is a competitive act.

174
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Go.

175
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
A tier point. I mean, look, I think it's cool.

176
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
The Marine Corps wrote this.

177
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
I'm stoked that it's a Marine Corps pub. I was a Marine.

178
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
But just like what you said, you could change the words of the Marine Corps.

179
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
You could put any word you wanted there.

180
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Because it's of the military.

181
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
You just made a connection to family.

182
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
This idea of competition.

183
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
So when I was looking at this at first, not knowing what to expect,

184
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
the connection that I was making of when they're talking about competing.

185
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
The first thing is competition doesn't have to be a bad thing.

186
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
That word shouldn't mean, oh, that means conflict and we're fighting.

187
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
That, that, is it what it means?

188
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And it doesn't have to be about two nations going to war.

189
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
And doesn't even have to be about the Marine Corps.

190
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And the fact that Marine Corps wrote it is cool.

191
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
That's not the point.

192
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
And something else that you've been talking about a lot lately,

193
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
and I've been, I've been stealing it.

194
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
You've been talking a lot about alignment.

195
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And when there's conflict in an organization,

196
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
and we see this at companies, we work with all the time.

197
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
What you need to do is find alignment.

198
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
And the thing I was just thinking in that first couple of sentences is

199
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
competition, the moral line you and I are, the healthier the competition is.

200
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Meaning the less likely the outcomes going to be some sort of conflict or a fight.

201
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
If we're aligned, really aligned, we might be competing all the time

202
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
just to make each other better, just do a better job for a client's whatever it is.

203
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And the likelihood of you and I competing, and we might be competing every day,

204
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
the likelihood of you and I competing turning it into a conflict is almost zero.

205
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Now, if we are highly misaligned,

206
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
then that competition has the potential of the outcome being much different.

207
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
But competition by itself, where it applies and what it means,

208
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
five minutes into what you're talking family.

209
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
So there's a connection here that is way deeper than at first couple of sentences

210
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
at face values, I'm looking at the Marine Corps public competition.

211
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
This is going to be cool. There's a lot more to it.

212
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
It doesn't have to be about the Marine Corps as you're listening to it either.

213
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Yeah, one of the notes that I took down early on,

214
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
where I started talking about 99%, the note that I took down when I was reading it for the first time,

215
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:26.000
was 99% of the time, you don't have to resort to violence because you can find the alignment.

216
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Because as long as you can find, and you've heard me say that on EF online,

217
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
if you can find alignment, well then we can work together.

218
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
If you and I are aligned, if you and I are not aligned on 48 different things that are a lower level things,

219
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
but we're aligned at the most important thing, we're good.

220
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
We're good. And the example of that,

221
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
what I bring up with companies is, hey, you know,

222
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
joccon Dave can't get along. Oh, okay.

223
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Well, they can't get along about what? Well, Dave wants to invest in that.

224
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Joccon wants to invest in that. Dave wants to move here.

225
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Joccon wants to move there. Okay, so they can't get along.

226
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Okay, well let's ask this question.

227
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Do Dave and Joccon who work at the same company?

228
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Do they want the company to make money?

229
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Yes. Do they want to be able to serve their customers?

230
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Yes. If we can get aligned on those things, then the rest of it is just figuring out the details.

231
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
And if you do what you were just talking about,

232
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
if the more you think in decentralized command,

233
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
the more you think in commanders intent,

234
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
the more you think strategically, unless you care about those details,

235
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
oh wait, oh, you want the same thing, dude, go do whatever you want.

236
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Let me know how I can help. Because then I think, oh,

237
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
none of those details matter at all. Because you want what I want,

238
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
and if I can just check my ego, go, oh, you know what?

239
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Dude, go, yeah, go do that. Can I back you up?

240
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Give me a call if I can help you. The competition part or the conflict part goes away.

241
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
And it allows you to accomplish so many more things.

242
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
If you think in decentralized command rather than just the action of, oh,

243
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
well, I'm a leader, I have to push some decisions down to my next layer down.

244
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
That's the actions of decentralized command. You're talking about thinking in decentralized command.

245
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
That's what lets you not worry about all those details.

246
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Yeah. And by the way, if I want Dave to be at point A,

247
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
and I know that Dave knows to go to point A,

248
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:18.000
I don't care how he gets there, but what's important is that allows me to look forward to look to the next point,

249
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
to look to point B or C or D. Because I'm not worried about how Dave's going to get there.

250
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And if you need some help, he knows to call me cool. No factor.

251
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:36.000
The capabilities, the Marine Corps generates in preparation for battle are also competitive as these capabilities are what

252
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
deter a potential rival from selecting a course of action above the threshold of violence.

253
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
So what they're saying there, what the United States Marine Corps is saying there is even if you want piece more than anything else,

254
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
you have better have a Marine Corps. You better have a Marine Corps to deter a potential rival from selecting a course of action.

255
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
That's violent. If you want piece to better have a Marine Corps.

256
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Are they going to be mad at me for deciphering all this? It's going easy.

257
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
God bless them. The Marine Corps, however, does not win our nation's competitions alone.

258
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:16.000
In fact, the Marine Corps is most likely to support or contribute to advancing US interest as a part of a much larger competitive strategy.

259
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
The Marine Corps can do a great deal to help the United States compete successfully,

260
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.000
but it will do so as part of a larger national effort. That extends well beyond military national powers.

261
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
So the Marine Corps has to cover move with all the other elements of the military.

262
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
We're team players. Yeah, not just the military, but the State Department and the economy and everything else.

263
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
The Marine Corps despite looking after themselves a little bit with this manual, they are team players.

264
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
From recruitment to retirement, Marines have the potential to help the nation compete in successful success.

265
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000
In other words, it starts with the right mindset when the recognized Marine Corps is top priorities to win battles.

266
00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:02.000
While also recognizing that war and warfare are segments of a larger spectrum known as the competition continuum.

267
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Marines need to be clear-eyed about this spectrum.

268
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Even when the Marines are not at war, one of its many forms in one of its many forms, they are still in a state of competition.

269
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
While demonstrating the ability to fight and win wars is crucial for deterrence, a successful foreign policy will avoid wars.

270
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Especially against great power rivals whenever possible. Great competition continuum.

271
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
This whole thing. It escalates.

272
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Competition is a fundamental aspect of international relations.

273
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000
As state non-state actors seek to protect and advance their own interests, they continually compete for the advantage.

274
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:51.000
That's what everyone is doing. Am I paranoid? I might be. I might be a little bit paranoid. People are competing. People are maneuvering.

275
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
That's what we're doing.

276
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
That's what other companies do in. That's what other departments do in. That's what other countries do in.

277
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
What are they doing that for? They're doing it to further their own interests.

278
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Now, going back to the idea of alignment, this also falls into agendas, because if Dave is trying to make some maneuver inside our company and I'm trying to make some maneuver inside of our company,

279
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000
as long as those maneuvers still get us to the point we want to go to, I don't care. We're good with it. We're fine.

280
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:40.000
So people trying to advance their own interests. Most of the time is fine, as long as they're not undercutting the strategic goals that we have.

281
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:49.000
But people are always competing. They're always making that little move. Some people, little bit more obvious than others.

282
00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:01.000
And here's what you got to watch out for. What you got to watch out for is when people have an agenda that helps them, but it doesn't move you in your strategic direction.

283
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:15.000
That's what you're watching out for. What you're watching out for is when Dave and his department, hey, it's great when Dave and his department are trying to get money so they can get more funds so they can hire more people so they can grow so they can get bigger production and they can move us toward the strategic goal of growing our business.

284
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:25.000
That's all good. Dave is literally competing to get more money for his department, so he can grow his department, which will help him create more income so our whole business moves forward. That's great.

285
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:39.000
But there's a chance that Dave wants to, you know, set up a, he wants to set up an office in happens to be point two miles down the road from his house happens to be in a building that he owns.

286
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Happens to want to charge a certain amount of rent. We don't need anything in that area, but he's doing it for himself. That's what we got to watch out for. And I'll tell you.

287
00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:05.000
When you're making those maneuvers for yourself. Everybody sees it. You think you're smart. You think you're getting away with it. You think no one notices. You think, oh, you know, why do I do on the building, but it's really a great spot. Nobody believes you.

288
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Nobody believes you. Nobody believes you. So don't do it. Don't do things for yourself interests.

289
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:21.000
That undermine that aren't aligned with this, geogical. Whenever I get somebody that I can't figure out quite why they're doing what they're doing.

290
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:32.000
I have a, what Dave, what do you mean? Why would explain to me why you want this building there again? Why you want to put an office there? Well, I'm telling you there's a really a good market and Dave, we're already in that market. We can control this other area.

291
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
But it's, you know, I think it'd be really good for the company. Okay, tell me what would be good. Well, you know, we could, we could have some offices there.

292
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:51.000
I understand what you want to do. Why is it good? So when I, when we can't, when I can't understand why it is you want to do something, there's a chance I need to say it wait a second.

293
00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Is Dave doing this for some reason, some agenda that is not for the good of the organization? Is he competing against what we're doing?

294
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Because that's a problem. And I'll see if he would ever come with time and so will everybody else.

295
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
It's so obvious, man. It's so obvious.

296
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Nations and other political actors pursue their interests constantly and in a variety of ways. Competition results when the interests of one political group interact in some way with another group.

297
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:36.000
These interactions take place in a dynamic environment. Each move, each move and actor makes towards fulfilling an interest changes that ecosystem.

298
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Any interaction of interests change the situation as well. So what does that mean? We got to track that out of loop. Right? Because every move you make or every move your competitor makes makes everything a little bit different.

299
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Competitions are often labeled as zero sum or positive sum. The zero sum rivalry means that if one group achieves its goal, then the rival group cannot achieve its own.

300
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:07.000
A good example of zero sum competition is when two nation struggle over the ownership of an island. In most cases, only one of them can physically control it at a time.

301
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Positive sum means that more than one group can make progress towards fulfilling interests or achieving goals at the same time.

302
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:22.000
For example, two nations may compete economically, but both may see their gross domestic product increase simultaneously.

303
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000
That's what I think we commonly refer to as a win-win situation. Which I love, which I love. I prefer.

304
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.000
We don't want to do zero sum. We want to say, oh, I don't want to do something to Dave's division that shuts his division down.

305
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:47.000
No, I want him to win and I want us, I meet a win. That's fine. Positive. Why is it positive? Why is it positive?

306
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
It's positive because I'm not just thinking tactically. I'm thinking strategically.

307
00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:06.000
And if what I do right now is burn Dave and burn his efforts to the ground, what is Dave going to do in two years and five years or ten years he's coming back at me?

308
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Now, are there times when you have to do score-turtle policy? Yes, there are.

309
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Most of the time, you don't have to. Most of the time it's better to build than destroy.

310
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Competition manifests itself in several ways, such as win-win actor attempts to impose its will on the other.

311
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Another way is win-win actor acts to frustrate another's plans, preventing them from achieving their goals.

312
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Think of when the is little things happen to you. Think of when you feel that someone like, wait a second. Why is echoing?

313
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Why is this another roadblock? Why is echoing? Why hasn't he done this little task yet? What's going on?

314
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Well, guess what? Sabotosh is what's going on? Trying to frustrate the goals.

315
00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Both of these mainly apply to zero sum struggles. In a positive sum example, two economic rivals will try to best each other.

316
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Like when they try to increase their market share in a particular industry at the expense of their rival while both of their economies grow.

317
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:14.000
That's fine. Competition especially at the nation state level is complex and it is systemic.

318
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
For example, auto manufacturers in the United States compete with rival companies. Isn't this interesting, Dave?

319
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:28.000
As often as we talk to businesses. And I'm often, well, I'm not often, but I've talked about this before. What came first?

320
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
The military learning from industry or industry learning from the military because it goes back and forth.

321
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:42.000
So, here we are in the Marine Corps manual that they just released. And what do they use for example? Not a war example. They use a business example.

322
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:50.000
The Marine Corps uses a business example. For example, auto manufacturers in the United States compete with rival companies in the European Union and Japan.

323
00:31:50.000 --> 00:32:01.000
But this does not mean the US government is also in direct competition with these governments. Even though the auto manufacturers are based in their respective territories.

324
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Indirectly, the auto manufacturers may lobby their governments asking them to take actions that favor their company in the global competition.

325
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:18.000
For auto sales, the individual actors are intertwined and interact with each other in many different ways. The details of this brief example are less important than it is from Marines to understand.

326
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
So, in those examples, but here's what you got to understand.

327
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Strategic competition among international political actors is multi-layered and networked.

328
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Each competitor consists of many parts that interact in complex ways. As we see from these examples, competition and cooperation can coexist.

329
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
And competition does not need to lead to conflict.

330
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:49.000
So, there's all so many factors that play. And that's on a national level, but there's so many factors that play in the way you talk to someone else.

331
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000
The way you treat somebody else and the facial expressions that you make.

332
00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Now we get into the continuum.

333
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:11.000
When I was at trade at training people, I would start off by giving them a problem and then a little bit of space to work through that problem.

334
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Then another problem and then a little bit of space to work and physical space.

335
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Like, okay, there's a problem that's going to happen before you get to the target.

336
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Then there's going to be a problem on target. Then there's going to be a problem as you leave the target.

337
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Then there's going to be a problem as you're at your extract point.

338
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.000
And so they're separated by time and space. So I were telling the leadership of this one task. And I said,

339
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Now I go that, you did a pretty good job.

340
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
But what you're going to see happen now is I am going to compress the time space continuum that these problems occur.

341
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Meaning they're going to occur at the same time in the same location.

342
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And that causes problems.

343
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
So the continuum that we're talking about here, this is no perfect model to use.

344
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
There is no perfect model to use and explaining the competition continuum.

345
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
The many feedback loops it contains make it very complex.

346
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
So models will omit some details.

347
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:10.000
However, the models are useful because they help explain specific concepts and assist Marines in building their own visualization of the continuum.

348
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000
So they have this basically a line on the one far side is pure piece.

349
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
The other far side is total war.

350
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
So it starts with pure piece.

351
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Then it goes to economic competition, classic diplomacy and geopolitics.

352
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
So that's not like, hey, we're at peace.

353
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
But wait, we're not quite at peace anymore.

354
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Now we're moving to economic competition.

355
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Maybe some classic diplomacy, some geopolitics.

356
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
And then you get into this area called political warfare.

357
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
At the far end of economic competition is political warfare, meaning I'm putting tariffs on you.

358
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
So that we're getting a more aggressive.

359
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Then you get to this area called the gray zone, which is now maybe its sanctions.

360
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
And now we're being really aggressive.

361
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Then you get to a hybrid war.

362
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
And then you get to the threat of violence.

363
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
And then you get to use a violence.

364
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
There's a threshold.

365
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
And once you get past the threshold of violence, you can go further right, which is conventional war.

366
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Okay, we're going to go to war.

367
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
We're going to have your tanks against my tanks, and your airplanes against my plants.

368
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
And then we get to total war, which is whatever it takes to survive and win, no mercy of any kind.

369
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
So that's a linear model of this.

370
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
There's also a circular model that they haven't.

371
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
By the way, you can get this manual.

372
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
You can just go on the Google, you know, one tack for competing.

373
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
And you'll find it.

374
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
And you can download it and print it.

375
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
What's up?

376
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:44.000
That could be an example of total war and versus conventional war, like which war was like a total war.

377
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.000
The closest I would say we got is World War II to total war.

378
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
But we were still, let's face it, we were still following the Geneva Convention.

379
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Right.

380
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:07.000
But imagine if things were so bad that you just were just killed, we'll just outright just kill, destroy, and chemical weapons and just total war.

381
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
I mean, in World War II, you know, we dropped, we dropped the atom bomb.

382
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
That's, that's freaking, that's just total war, right?

383
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
You're killing everyone.

384
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:26.000
We fire bombed Dresden, 250,000 civilians, or 250,000 people, many civilians dead of an entire city destroyed.

385
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Go Google Dresden before and after.

386
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.000
I mean, it's not quite as shocking as Hiroshima, Nagasaki before and after, but it's complete and utter devastation.

387
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
It's as much devastation as we could possibly cause with the weapons we had at hand.

388
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Is there like a scenario where like one side is at total war?

389
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
And the other side is like, hey, we're going to keep this kind of conventional.

390
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
I mean, it seems like, right, like certain, we'll say groups, whether we nation, whatever, have a certain philosophy.

391
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
I would say that, yeah, I mean, I think we, I don't know if we could get to swear someone was at total war.

392
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I mean, I think the Japanese were pretty close.

393
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
I think the Nazis were pretty close to total war.

394
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
They would do whatever they, you know, they do whatever they could.

395
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:18.000
But even even, yeah, they, even they had limits, you know.

396
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
But I mean, let's face it, they were close.

397
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
They were close.

398
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
I mean, Japan was doing their best to develop chemical and biological weapons that they could use.

399
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Without they were on that path and would, if they had gotten them, you think they would have done it?

400
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Yeah, I'm going to say affirmative. So they might have been a total war.

401
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
You know, you can maybe look at some of these, some of these non-state actors, right?

402
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
I mean, ISIS was ISIS at total war.

403
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
They don't have, they didn't have the capabilities or the means.

404
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:58.000
But if they had the opportunity to just kill, indiscriminately killed as many people as they possibly could would they?

405
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Yeah, probably.

406
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Yeah, that's what I mean.

407
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Yeah, these groups, like yeah, they don't have the physical capability, but that was their approach.

408
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Like that, they, in their mind, in their mind, in their mind, in their own war.

409
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Yeah.

410
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Yep.

411
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Yeah.

412
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:20.000
The next thing we're talking about a circular model, a circular model shows conflict above violence threshold and competition below it.

413
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And they kind of go through these.

414
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
One of the things that brings up here, one of the actors could be deterred.

415
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
So you might think you're going towards war, but then you get deterred.

416
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.000
The threat of violence could have been significant leverage and other rivals decided, you know what?

417
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
I don't want none of this.

418
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Tension receipts.

419
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Negotiations of some kind may have succeeded, bringing the actors back from the threshold of violence.

420
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
These are all things that think about a, for you as a balancer, right?

421
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Think about as you approach a level of like there's a threshold of violence where someone's taken a swing.

422
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Think about all the little things that could happen that could deescalate that.

423
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
You know, maybe it's negotiation, hey, look man, you just need to get out of here.

424
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Maybe, hey, we're calling the cops.

425
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
How often does that one work?

426
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Pretty often.

427
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Yeah.

428
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Right?

429
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Yeah.

430
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.000
There's a, when you, whatever you go through this training and that's part of it, that whole thing that escalation of force, right?

431
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
And there's like many thresholds.

432
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000
You know, like first, it's like straight up friendly and the better you can get roadhouse quotes in here.

433
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Oh, yeah.

434
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Well, he rode out of stay, do kind of go.

435
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Little bit of a little bit of a, yeah, it's sort of the trading you went to.

436
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
You know, obviously, some like real positive and flashbacks about more images of you and, and what's his name?

437
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Body.

438
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Body.

439
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
No, Dalton.

440
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Real Body's from point of view.

441
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Body's from point of view.

442
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Yeah.

443
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Which I respect by the way.

444
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
So yeah, well, in a way, yeah, because okay, so Dalton, that wasn't really a training that was more of a lecture.

445
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
And now's a very specific philosophy, which was cool.

446
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000
I dig it.

447
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Also, there's different philosophies in the, in the, I would say, the continuum of violence.

448
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
It's a function of spectrum of the continuum.

449
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Yeah, fully.

450
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
But each, yeah, each level has it like a little threshold, like I said, but yes, the most prominent one is like, yeah.

451
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
And it's kind of the same thing.

452
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000
It reflects that total work kind of situation where, you know, like, let's go to that end part of the spectrum, right?

453
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
So like total war is like, we don't have time for the police to come.

454
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:27.000
We got to like, we got to act because this person is violent towards us or whatever, and then it's a straight up fight where you can expect like,

455
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
laws to be broken within that fight kind of thing.

456
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
And then there's like one before where it's like, okay, we got to like put our hands on him.

457
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
We got to whether be restrained or whatever, but we're, we're not trying to be violent towards this person.

458
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
We have to use what they used to call it the minimum force necessary.

459
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
So I use that term all the time.

460
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Yeah, minimum force required or minimum force necessary.

461
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Yeah, I mean, I think a more appropriate term would be, you know, uh, we'll say inappropriate amount of force.

462
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Okay.

463
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
You know, because minimum, I don't know, there's just a lot of wiggle room for some stuff to not go right for us.

464
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Yeah, yeah.

465
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Yeah, yeah.

466
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
But that's like the conventional war kind of scenario, you know.

467
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Where you're telling the police that the minimum force was, the minimum force required was what was used.

468
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Yes.

469
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Even though you may have used the appropriate.

470
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000
So there's maybe a little linguistics, jujitsu, jujitsu happening, because we want to, you know,

471
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
we don't want to see echo Charles locked up back in the day.

472
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
No, you don't.

473
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
But I mean, you could, it could be argued that they're the same thing.

474
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
You know, where it's like inappropriate amount of force.

475
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Meaning like you're not abusing this guy, no matter how much he's verbally whatever whatever, whatever,

476
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000
but yeah, it's, but there is that, there's rules, like yeah, put your hands on him, use force.

477
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Knock him out if you have to, you know, like you can do these kind of things,

478
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
but you can be just like violating all kinds of, you know,

479
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
see, because it's not going to war.

480
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
It's not going to war.

481
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
There's a line in here.

482
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.80
It says there are many possibilities on how rivals can turn away from the violence threshold and return to steady state

483
00:42:05.80 --> 00:42:06.80
competition.

484
00:42:06.80 --> 00:42:09.80
And I made a note in here for myself.

485
00:42:09.80 --> 00:42:20.80
That crossing that line is almost always a tactical move, a tactical meaning.

486
00:42:20.80 --> 00:42:26.80
It is an immediate, it's solving this immediate problem, but it's seldom a strategic move.

487
00:42:26.80 --> 00:42:30.80
Because think about it when, if you're in the street and you get into a fight,

488
00:42:30.80 --> 00:42:33.80
you want to do everything you can to avoid that fight.

489
00:42:33.80 --> 00:42:39.80
And if you have to engage in that fight, it's almost guaranteed to be a tactical win and a strategic loss.

490
00:42:39.80 --> 00:42:44.80
Now you've got to go to jail, now you've got to pay this guy money, now you've got to get arrested, now you've got cuts on your hands.

491
00:42:44.80 --> 00:42:46.80
You've got all these little problems.

492
00:42:46.80 --> 00:42:50.80
And it would have been infinitely better to have just said, you know what?

493
00:42:50.80 --> 00:42:55.80
This guy's not worth it or whatever you walk away from a leadership perspective.

494
00:42:55.80 --> 00:42:59.80
It is almost always, almost always,

495
00:42:59.80 --> 00:43:09.80
if you cross the line and there's some gap, but indirect when you go from, from indirect influence to direct,

496
00:43:09.80 --> 00:43:14.80
it's almost always a, it might be a tactical win, it's just going to be a strategic loss.

497
00:43:14.80 --> 00:43:19.80
So the minute I say, you know what Dave, I'm not talking about this anymore, here's what you're going to do.

498
00:43:19.80 --> 00:43:24.80
That's almost guaranteed to be a tactical win because you're going to go and execute whatever I told you to do.

499
00:43:24.80 --> 00:43:27.80
But guess what, strategically, I just took a step back.

500
00:43:27.80 --> 00:43:32.80
I took this strategic hit. I'm not saying I can't recover from it, but strategically it's a negative.

501
00:43:32.80 --> 00:43:35.80
So we have to be careful with that.

502
00:43:35.80 --> 00:43:42.80
It says here, we also see that sometimes the threshold is crossed for a short time.

503
00:43:42.80 --> 00:43:46.80
Only to jump back down into a state of competition below the violent special.

504
00:43:46.80 --> 00:43:47.80
That's great.

505
00:43:47.80 --> 00:43:52.80
Just as described above, note that the turns is not the only thing that causes a movement in this model.

506
00:43:52.80 --> 00:43:59.80
A competitor could also move below the violence threshold. Again, if he achieves its goals, negotiate it up our again.

507
00:43:59.80 --> 00:44:06.80
A thoughtful review of this model shows it as many uses. So always look to not cross that, that threshold from,

508
00:44:06.80 --> 00:44:12.80
to indivisance or into direct orders if you're in a leadership position.

509
00:44:12.80 --> 00:44:18.80
You use direct orders. You use your rank to influence that.

510
00:44:18.80 --> 00:44:23.80
However, make no mistake that the above models simply offer us different views to consider.

511
00:44:23.80 --> 00:44:29.80
And this is the circulator and the linear model. They offer different views on how to consider as we study strategic competition.

512
00:44:29.80 --> 00:44:36.80
All of the terms we use, including conflict, competition violence, and even war are part of an organic whole.

513
00:44:36.80 --> 00:44:46.80
All of these terms reside on a single continuum that describes the relationship between and among states in international relations.

514
00:44:46.80 --> 00:44:54.80
But it's not just states. It just have to remind you this. It's different divisions inside your company. It's different personalities inside your team.

515
00:44:54.80 --> 00:44:59.80
There's all these levels on this continuum.

516
00:44:59.80 --> 00:45:12.80
These political actors use activities at various points in the continuum to advance their interests and also to set conditions to make it easier for them to achieve their interest in the future.

517
00:45:12.80 --> 00:45:16.80
This behavior is like a judo competition.

518
00:45:16.80 --> 00:45:23.80
When a competitor constantly tries to put the opponent off balance, sometimes through the application of violence,

519
00:45:23.80 --> 00:45:27.80
sometimes by moving a position of advantage.

520
00:45:27.80 --> 00:45:33.80
Or moving to a position of advantage. War itself is an integral part of this continuum.

521
00:45:33.80 --> 00:45:39.80
So that's judo, right? Every move is not war, every move is a set up.

522
00:45:39.80 --> 00:45:44.80
You'll set up here and then you're looking for that equal.

523
00:45:44.80 --> 00:45:55.80
Here is some of the work of the state department's George F. Kenan following World War II.

524
00:45:55.80 --> 00:46:08.80
Kenan was the author of the famous long telegram that described the nature of the Soviet Union and alerted decision makers to the emerging Cold War and the need for the US government to organize itself for a political warfare.

525
00:46:08.80 --> 00:46:12.80
And here's what he wrote.

526
00:46:12.80 --> 00:46:17.80
Political warfare is the logical application of cloud squids doctrine in a time of peace.

527
00:46:17.80 --> 00:46:22.80
In broadest definition, political warfare is the employment of all means of a nation's command.

528
00:46:22.80 --> 00:46:26.80
Adhernations command short of war to achieve its national objectives.

529
00:46:26.80 --> 00:46:28.80
That's George Kenan, that's what he wrote.

530
00:46:28.80 --> 00:46:33.80
And it says these opening words to Kenan's paper were directed to the national security council.

531
00:46:33.80 --> 00:46:42.80
The paper advocated for both over and covert means to compete internationally short of using violence.

532
00:46:42.80 --> 00:46:48.80
In the Cold War struggle that was just beginning, Kenan stated that the United States was handicapped by a belief.

533
00:46:48.80 --> 00:46:50.80
And this is why I had to include this part.

534
00:46:50.80 --> 00:47:02.80
Because this is a mistake that we make as people, Kenan stated that the United States was handicapped by a belief that there was that there is a basic difference between war and peace.

535
00:47:02.80 --> 00:47:09.80
To view war as a sort of sporting context, context outside the political context.

536
00:47:09.80 --> 00:47:13.80
So in America we just look like you're either at war or you're not.

537
00:47:13.80 --> 00:47:16.80
He's like, no, you're competing all the time.

538
00:47:16.80 --> 00:47:26.80
His work helped decision makers understand ideas like political warfare, which then helped the United States build the capability successful to compete in the Cold War.

539
00:47:26.80 --> 00:47:30.80
Yeah, you're going to need more than tanks and plans if you're going to win.

540
00:47:30.80 --> 00:47:35.80
Yeah, and there's a whole thing that's happening.

541
00:47:35.80 --> 00:47:38.80
So when it's happening, it's happening all the time.

542
00:47:38.80 --> 00:47:39.80
That is happening all the time.

543
00:47:39.80 --> 00:47:43.80
So when you're in a leadership position, guess what?

544
00:47:43.80 --> 00:47:58.80
There is an infinite number of things that you need to be ready to do and doing to lead besides war, which is shut up and do what I told you to do.

545
00:47:58.80 --> 00:48:07.80
Kenan's diagnosis of the competition significantly shaped the way it unfolded across the whole of the United States government in the decades of fall.

546
00:48:07.80 --> 00:48:09.80
This highlights two important points from Reigns.

547
00:48:09.80 --> 00:48:15.80
The first is the importance of accurately identifying the nature of the competition one faces.

548
00:48:15.80 --> 00:48:18.80
Imagine that.

549
00:48:18.80 --> 00:48:23.80
Accurately identifying the nature of competition one faces.

550
00:48:23.80 --> 00:48:28.80
You know, I was I was Dave caught me on the end of a call with the client.

551
00:48:28.80 --> 00:48:37.80
And I was like, we need to be at war and I guess I always refer to my clients as we, you know, whenever I'm talking to one of our clients, it's we.

552
00:48:37.80 --> 00:48:38.80
It's us totally.

553
00:48:38.80 --> 00:48:39.80
We are at war with you.

554
00:48:39.80 --> 00:48:43.80
I said, we got to we got to go to war with them, but we don't want them to know it.

555
00:48:43.80 --> 00:48:45.80
So I mean, there's not going to be any over actions.

556
00:48:45.80 --> 00:48:46.80
All going to be covert.

557
00:48:46.80 --> 00:48:52.80
Here's some methodology we can do that we went through some of these ways that we could go to war without going to war.

558
00:48:52.80 --> 00:48:53.80
That way it is understood.

559
00:48:53.80 --> 00:49:08.80
The way that it is understood will affect the choices made and how to pursue the competition.

560
00:49:08.80 --> 00:49:12.80
And accurate appreciation will increase the chances for success.

561
00:49:12.80 --> 00:49:16.80
Marines have an important but supporting role in strategic competition.

562
00:49:16.80 --> 00:49:21.80
This shapes the way we approach our competitive efforts.

563
00:49:21.80 --> 00:49:22.80
So now we get into this section.

564
00:49:22.80 --> 00:49:23.80
Did you have some of them?

565
00:49:23.80 --> 00:49:31.80
I just think in making the connection to the conversations we have with our clients or even just in any leadership role.

566
00:49:31.80 --> 00:49:35.80
How often does my ego let me dump with the conclusion of it?

567
00:49:35.80 --> 00:49:37.80
You're doing something different than what I'm doing.

568
00:49:37.80 --> 00:49:38.80
That's a problem.

569
00:49:38.80 --> 00:49:39.80
And I got to attack it like it's a problem.

570
00:49:39.80 --> 00:49:44.80
And I got to treat you like now we're competitors as opposed to, you know what?

571
00:49:44.80 --> 00:49:49.80
I need to accurately identify the nature of this situation.

572
00:49:49.80 --> 00:49:52.80
Which means I got to look at it and go, oh hang on.

573
00:49:52.80 --> 00:49:53.80
Why is Jacob making this move?

574
00:49:53.80 --> 00:49:55.80
Why is he doing that?

575
00:49:55.80 --> 00:50:00.80
And if I can figure that out, if there actually is the situation that you're at the same company,

576
00:50:00.80 --> 00:50:04.80
more often than not, there's going to be a positive reason for that.

577
00:50:04.80 --> 00:50:05.80
I just got to figure that out.

578
00:50:05.80 --> 00:50:08.80
Or I can just say, oh that's not what I would have done.

579
00:50:08.80 --> 00:50:09.80
Let's fight.

580
00:50:09.80 --> 00:50:12.80
And then we can compete with each other and go at each other.

581
00:50:12.80 --> 00:50:18.80
And the ability, the need to be able to strategically understand what is really good.

582
00:50:18.80 --> 00:50:19.80
What is really going on?

583
00:50:19.80 --> 00:50:22.80
And how often your ego gets in the way go, oh, that's a problem.

584
00:50:22.80 --> 00:50:24.80
John goes doing this, that's a problem.

585
00:50:24.80 --> 00:50:25.80
And now we're fighting.

586
00:50:25.80 --> 00:50:27.80
Now we're competing and now we're going at each other.

587
00:50:27.80 --> 00:50:29.80
Instead of me just taking a little step back and going, hey, hey help.

588
00:50:29.80 --> 00:50:31.80
This movie just made to help me understand that.

589
00:50:31.80 --> 00:50:33.80
Oh yeah, I did this for these couple reasons.

590
00:50:33.80 --> 00:50:34.80
Oh, okay, good to go.

591
00:50:34.80 --> 00:50:35.80
So we're actually not competing here.

592
00:50:35.80 --> 00:50:36.80
We're on the same page.

593
00:50:36.80 --> 00:50:42.80
That is a, when we talk about people ask us questions all the time about, I'm having this problem.

594
00:50:42.80 --> 00:50:47.80
This person, that person is almost always comes back to, well, what is it that's really going on?

595
00:50:47.80 --> 00:50:49.80
And you talk about climbing up the ladder of alignment.

596
00:50:49.80 --> 00:50:54.80
Can you just find where what he's doing, what you're doing actually achieve the same end?

597
00:50:54.80 --> 00:50:56.80
Or at least are heading in the same direction.

598
00:50:56.80 --> 00:51:01.80
Yeah, something that it's not automatically immediately a problem that you got to now go to war over.

599
00:51:03.80 --> 00:51:05.80
Uh, next section.

600
00:51:05.80 --> 00:51:12.80
And again, my, so to the Marine Corps for just even having this thought, war is a special kind of competition.

601
00:51:12.80 --> 00:51:15.80
That's the name of this section.

602
00:51:15.80 --> 00:51:23.80
Our war fighting philosophy informs us that war is a violent clash of interest between or among organized groups characterized by the use of military force.

603
00:51:23.80 --> 00:51:27.80
War is fundamentally an interactive social process.

604
00:51:27.80 --> 00:51:29.80
Hold on.

605
00:51:31.80 --> 00:51:33.80
I've been studying war for a long time.

606
00:51:33.80 --> 00:51:40.80
I've never really thought of it as a fundamentally interactive social process, but I guess we'll go with it.

607
00:51:40.80 --> 00:51:51.80
It's essence is a violent struggle between two hostile independent and irreconcilable wheels each trying to impose itself on the other.

608
00:51:51.80 --> 00:51:53.80
That I agree with.

609
00:51:53.80 --> 00:51:56.80
That means not really an interactive social process.

610
00:51:56.80 --> 00:51:58.80
That's a freaking scrap.

611
00:51:58.80 --> 00:51:59.80
War.

612
00:51:59.80 --> 00:52:02.80
So what am I missing there?

613
00:52:02.80 --> 00:52:09.80
I guess what I'm missing there is that there is this aspect that you need to have.

614
00:52:09.80 --> 00:52:16.80
That you need to have two elements that are that are interacting.

615
00:52:16.80 --> 00:52:20.80
To have this to have a war take place.

616
00:52:20.80 --> 00:52:22.80
I mean, it takes two to tango right?

617
00:52:22.80 --> 00:52:30.80
I guess I'm just picturing who of the six authors that got locked in a room to write this club, which who who was the guy that got held onto that line.

618
00:52:30.80 --> 00:52:32.80
Who was like, no, no, no, no, no, really.

619
00:52:32.80 --> 00:52:35.80
I'm telling you, it's an interactive social process.

620
00:52:35.80 --> 00:52:38.80
And the other father like the guy's just put it in there or whatever.

621
00:52:38.80 --> 00:52:40.80
Yeah, we did Colonel Pog.

622
00:52:40.80 --> 00:52:42.80
Did it get us pause on this thing?

623
00:52:42.80 --> 00:52:43.80
I don't know.

624
00:52:43.80 --> 00:52:45.80
Well, who knows, maybe they'll revise it.

625
00:52:45.80 --> 00:52:51.80
Maybe someone will explain it to me because you can tell look when you read these Marine Corps, few manuals.

626
00:52:51.80 --> 00:52:53.80
They're so well written.

627
00:52:53.80 --> 00:52:55.80
They're so clean.

628
00:52:55.80 --> 00:52:58.80
They don't leave things in there that aren't there in their free.

629
00:52:58.80 --> 00:52:59.80
That's why I question myself here.

630
00:52:59.80 --> 00:53:01.80
I don't know what I'm missing.

631
00:53:01.80 --> 00:53:07.80
But it's just let at a minimum it's a strange way to describe war as an interactive social process.

632
00:53:07.80 --> 00:53:10.80
But we'll go with it.

633
00:53:10.80 --> 00:53:12.80
War's character.

634
00:53:12.80 --> 00:53:18.80
Wars character can take many forms from using military force to simply restore order during disaster relief

635
00:53:18.80 --> 00:53:22.80
operations to completely overturning the existing order within a society.

636
00:53:22.80 --> 00:53:26.80
War resides on the competition continuum above the threat threshold of violence.

637
00:53:26.80 --> 00:53:31.80
From a military perspective, we also call the points along this scale above the threshold.

638
00:53:31.80 --> 00:53:34.80
Various forms of armed conflict.

639
00:53:34.80 --> 00:53:42.80
There are many descriptors of the form that war takes such as insurgency, hybrid conventional.

640
00:53:42.80 --> 00:53:50.80
When we think of competition in war, the main points are to acknowledge that war is a political act that uses violence to achieve its aims.

641
00:53:50.80 --> 00:53:55.80
But it's also part of a spectrum of other competitor vacts that do not use violence.

642
00:53:55.80 --> 00:53:56.80
Okay.

643
00:53:56.80 --> 00:53:58.80
So war isn't just what's happening on the battlefield.

644
00:53:58.80 --> 00:53:59.80
It's everything else as well.

645
00:53:59.80 --> 00:54:03.80
In the circular model of competition, conflict feeds back into competition.

646
00:54:03.80 --> 00:54:08.80
War sets the conditions for the character of the competition that follows it.

647
00:54:08.80 --> 00:54:12.80
War is like a violent move in judo contest.

648
00:54:12.80 --> 00:54:19.80
In a judo contest, it's use can put a competitor into an advantageous position relative to the opponent.

649
00:54:19.80 --> 00:54:20.80
Okay.

650
00:54:20.80 --> 00:54:22.80
Those things are pretty straightforward.

651
00:54:22.80 --> 00:54:26.80
Obviously, I had a judo player in the room.

652
00:54:26.80 --> 00:54:29.80
One of the six people that wrote this thing.

653
00:54:29.80 --> 00:54:37.80
Competition contains many of the same attributes as war.

654
00:54:37.80 --> 00:54:39.80
Ambiguti.

655
00:54:39.80 --> 00:54:41.80
Ambiguti.

656
00:54:41.80 --> 00:54:42.80
Ambiguti.

657
00:54:42.80 --> 00:54:45.80
Competition contains many of the same attributes as war.

658
00:54:45.80 --> 00:54:47.80
Isn't that interesting?

659
00:54:47.80 --> 00:54:55.80
Ambiguti, just like in war, Ambiguti seems to be everywhere we turn in competition.

660
00:54:55.80 --> 00:55:03.80
And I just did kind of win off on on a F online about the fact that we don't know what's going to happen.

661
00:55:03.80 --> 00:55:10.80
There's Ambiguti and everything and yet people will just dig in.

662
00:55:10.80 --> 00:55:15.80
And Dave says, hey, we should attack from the west and I say, no, we should attack from the north.

663
00:55:15.80 --> 00:55:17.80
We don't know where the enemy is.

664
00:55:17.80 --> 00:55:20.80
Why am I so hostile towards Dave?

665
00:55:20.80 --> 00:55:23.80
Because he wants to attack from the west and I want to attack from the north.

666
00:55:23.80 --> 00:55:25.80
I have no idea where the enemy is going to be.

667
00:55:25.80 --> 00:55:27.80
Why am I digging in on that?

668
00:55:27.80 --> 00:55:31.80
Because I'm an idiot and I let him I ego run it.

669
00:55:31.80 --> 00:55:38.80
As noted, two groups may try to best each other in one area while they cooperate in another,

670
00:55:38.80 --> 00:55:42.80
which can make the nature of the relationship between them unclear.

671
00:55:42.80 --> 00:55:47.80
The differences among rivals often clouds the pictures as well.

672
00:55:47.80 --> 00:55:52.80
If the interests of two groups collide, but the interests of the first group are vital while those of the second group are a little bit

673
00:55:52.80 --> 00:56:02.80
of a priority, there will be a mismatch between how the two groups view the competition.

674
00:56:02.80 --> 00:56:07.80
The first thing about the differences cloud the picture for sure.

675
00:56:07.80 --> 00:56:11.80
And that's why we always want to understand what someone else's perspective is.

676
00:56:11.80 --> 00:56:17.80
Because otherwise we're looking at two different things and we can't comprehend how to come to some kind of a solution.

677
00:56:17.80 --> 00:56:19.80
And then this is an interesting one.

678
00:56:19.80 --> 00:56:22.80
And something you need to pay attention to as a leader.

679
00:56:22.80 --> 00:56:24.80
Someone comes to you and says, hey, we really want to do this.

680
00:56:24.80 --> 00:56:30.80
And to you, you're like, at 0.00, it's a rounding error on our bottom line.

681
00:56:30.80 --> 00:56:31.80
Whatever.

682
00:56:31.80 --> 00:56:33.80
We don't need to do that.

683
00:56:33.80 --> 00:56:37.80
But man, for whatever group that is, that might be the highest priority thing they've gotten.

684
00:56:37.80 --> 00:56:39.80
You're just throwing it away.

685
00:56:39.80 --> 00:56:45.80
So pay attention to what the priorities are and what priorities seem to you might be different.

686
00:56:45.80 --> 00:56:47.80
And not just the priorities.

687
00:56:47.80 --> 00:56:49.80
The importance.

688
00:56:49.80 --> 00:56:50.80
How do you say that word?

689
00:56:50.80 --> 00:56:51.80
The importance he said it correct.

690
00:56:51.80 --> 00:56:59.80
Okay. The importance of the way somebody feels the level of some element is.

691
00:56:59.80 --> 00:57:03.80
I think something super important and echo doesn't think it's a big deal.

692
00:57:03.80 --> 00:57:08.80
We're going to have a hard time communicating and coming to a good resolution that makes sense to both of us.

693
00:57:08.80 --> 00:57:13.80
If he can understand, oh, this is really important to jockel because of these things.

694
00:57:13.80 --> 00:57:18.80
They got it. Dave Dave comes to me. It's critical that we get this office building up in this area.

695
00:57:18.80 --> 00:57:22.80
Well, is that so important to Dave? Oh, because Dave lives two blocks away. Oh, cool. Got it.

696
00:57:22.80 --> 00:57:24.80
At least I understand that.

697
00:57:24.80 --> 00:57:29.80
But it could be that Dave has some big project that he's company that's going to come on board and blah blah blah.

698
00:57:29.80 --> 00:57:31.80
Then you could have a really important reason.

699
00:57:31.80 --> 00:57:36.80
And if I don't understand that or see that, we're not going to be able to connect and figure things out.

700
00:57:36.80 --> 00:57:39.80
You talk about the with kids all the time when kids will come to you with the problem.

701
00:57:39.80 --> 00:57:43.80
It sounded like the end of the world. If you're looking at them like, dude, this is this is no big deal.

702
00:57:43.80 --> 00:57:45.80
But actually to them, it's a huge deal.

703
00:57:45.80 --> 00:57:49.80
And the connection you can actually make is just understanding, oh, I got it.

704
00:57:49.80 --> 00:57:51.80
This is a big deal to you. The man who's handled it better.

705
00:57:51.80 --> 00:57:52.80
No big deal. It can sort it out.

706
00:57:52.80 --> 00:57:55.80
But you make that connection even at that level all the time at that level.

707
00:57:55.80 --> 00:57:57.80
They say, this is the end of the world for me.

708
00:57:57.80 --> 00:58:00.80
And then you're mind like you're not going to remember this in two months.

709
00:58:00.80 --> 00:58:04.80
Yeah, and you know what's weird is we talk about kids.

710
00:58:04.80 --> 00:58:10.80
That includes people that are 32 years old. That includes people that are 27 years old.

711
00:58:10.80 --> 00:58:17.80
Right? When you're worrying is falling apart, you have to understand how important things are to people.

712
00:58:17.80 --> 00:58:19.80
And that's what this is talking about.

713
00:58:19.80 --> 00:58:23.80
What's a roundening air? It seemed like a small thing.

714
00:58:23.80 --> 00:58:25.80
But what is that? A roundening?

715
00:58:25.80 --> 00:58:26.80
That's a roundening.

716
00:58:26.80 --> 00:58:30.80
Let's say echo Charles was making $400 million a year.

717
00:58:30.80 --> 00:58:34.80
And as they calculate all the money, there's $200,000.

718
00:58:34.80 --> 00:58:35.80
And they're like, oh, whatever.

719
00:58:35.80 --> 00:58:39.80
Like, it's just a little rounding air. It's a little tiny bit of money in the big scheme of things.

720
00:58:39.80 --> 00:58:40.80
All right.

721
00:58:40.80 --> 00:58:44.80
So you came to me like, hey, I really want to, you know, really want some more money for this.

722
00:58:44.80 --> 00:58:46.80
And I'm like, whatever. It's a rounding air.

723
00:58:46.80 --> 00:58:47.80
We're not doing that.

724
00:58:47.80 --> 00:58:49.80
And you're mad.

725
00:58:49.80 --> 00:58:52.80
But it's something that was very important to you.

726
00:58:52.80 --> 00:58:53.80
Right.

727
00:58:53.80 --> 00:58:55.80
And before it's time teams, entire annual budget's 2-1-3.

728
00:58:55.80 --> 00:58:59.80
And this means in my entire six month project is on this, you're like, whatever.

729
00:58:59.80 --> 00:59:01.80
I can't even count that low.

730
00:59:01.80 --> 00:59:03.80
And you just dismiss it like it's useless.

731
00:59:03.80 --> 00:59:04.80
And I'm wondering if anything in broad.

732
00:59:04.80 --> 00:59:06.80
This is my whole thing.

733
00:59:06.80 --> 00:59:06.80
Yeah.

734
00:59:06.80 --> 00:59:08.80
You just don't be that guy.

735
00:59:08.80 --> 00:59:09.80
Good.

736
00:59:11.80 --> 00:59:15.80
Sometimes the scale of two rivals are so different at Leeds and ambiguity.

737
00:59:15.80 --> 00:59:19.80
For example, it took many years of the 1990s for the United States to conclude.

738
00:59:19.80 --> 00:59:25.80
It was in a struggle without Kaira, even as the competition bounced above and below the threshold of violence.

739
00:59:25.80 --> 00:59:30.80
Rivals often use or create ambiguity to cloak their actions.

740
00:59:30.80 --> 00:59:36.80
They do this intentionally to obscure their aims until it's too late for the competitors to react effectively.

741
00:59:36.80 --> 00:59:43.80
They want to use ambiguous acts to cause indecision, confusion, and hesitation.

742
00:59:43.80 --> 00:59:53.80
That is going on all the time with people that you work with with your wife, with your husband.

743
00:59:53.80 --> 00:59:56.80
And you know, it's like, oh, where are you going?

744
00:59:56.80 --> 00:59:58.80
I'm just going to head out.

745
00:59:58.80 --> 01:00:03.80
Like there's all these little ambiguous responses that happen.

746
01:00:03.80 --> 01:00:06.80
And then the next thing, you know, you look up and it's like, wait a second.

747
01:00:06.80 --> 01:00:09.80
Where do we get this new car from?

748
01:00:09.80 --> 01:00:13.80
Oh, I thought, you said, you needed anything about that.

749
01:00:13.80 --> 01:00:14.80
I told you all that now.

750
01:00:14.80 --> 01:00:16.80
Yeah, told you all that now.

751
01:00:16.80 --> 01:00:22.80
So, and I must say ambiguous acts.

752
01:00:22.80 --> 01:00:25.80
Or good to recognize.

753
01:00:25.80 --> 01:00:30.80
They're also good to utilize in, you know, put that in your toolbox.

754
01:00:30.80 --> 01:00:34.80
And if you're a leader too, you see those words in decision, confusion, hesitation.

755
01:00:34.80 --> 01:00:37.80
If you're a leader, those are problems.

756
01:00:37.80 --> 01:00:41.80
Those are those are not good things for you and you or your people are dealing with those.

757
01:00:41.80 --> 01:00:47.80
You got to, those are the things you have to address and fix and clarify.

758
01:00:47.80 --> 01:00:49.80
I suppose it's like, okay.

759
01:00:49.80 --> 01:00:52.80
And then, and then things start to get away from you and people are operating.

760
01:00:52.80 --> 01:00:53.80
They don't know what's going on.

761
01:00:53.80 --> 01:00:57.80
I like it when I catch somebody.

762
01:00:57.80 --> 01:01:01.80
When I catch somebody, trying to throw some ambiguity at me.

763
01:01:01.80 --> 01:01:06.80
And then my big word and Boba Blond, figures and learn.

764
01:01:06.80 --> 01:01:08.80
You just, and you just let them do it.

765
01:01:08.80 --> 01:01:14.80
And then right, when I let them do it, I usually, I usually give them like a, like,

766
01:01:14.80 --> 01:01:18.80
I give them enough time, maybe even another, two, three, four minutes.

767
01:01:18.80 --> 01:01:22.80
Maybe even seven minutes of discussion about something else.

768
01:01:22.80 --> 01:01:26.80
And, but I, you're a see me on, like when I'm doing a zoom meeting,

769
01:01:26.80 --> 01:01:28.80
and I was have a pad right next to me.

770
01:01:28.80 --> 01:01:30.80
You know, I don't be writing something down, I'll be writing.

771
01:01:30.80 --> 01:01:35.80
You know, whatever, right down a note about what Dave said.

772
01:01:35.80 --> 01:01:39.80
And then when he ambiguity threw in there.

773
01:01:39.80 --> 01:01:43.80
And then seven minutes later, he thinks he's clean.

774
01:01:43.80 --> 01:01:44.80
Right, yeah.

775
01:01:44.80 --> 01:01:45.80
He's got away with it.

776
01:01:45.80 --> 01:01:47.80
And I go, hey, when you start to do that,

777
01:01:47.80 --> 01:01:49.80
when you start to really, what do you mean by this?

778
01:01:49.80 --> 01:01:51.80
And it's such a good thing to give them a little bit of time,

779
01:01:51.80 --> 01:01:53.80
because then it catches them off guard.

780
01:01:53.80 --> 01:01:54.80
And they're not ready for it.

781
01:01:54.80 --> 01:01:57.80
If you ask them immediately, they're ready to maneuver some more.

782
01:01:57.80 --> 01:02:00.80
And if you catch them with it, and it's fun.

783
01:02:00.80 --> 01:02:01.80
That's funny.

784
01:02:01.80 --> 01:02:03.80
You mentioned that, because I noticed that early on,

785
01:02:03.80 --> 01:02:05.80
way long time ago, years ago.

786
01:02:05.80 --> 01:02:08.80
And one of the things, I remember concluding that you were like that.

787
01:02:08.80 --> 01:02:12.80
Not so much that you liked it, but that, like, that was the thing.

788
01:02:12.80 --> 01:02:14.80
If you throw some ambiguous stuff at you, like you're going to be like,

789
01:02:14.80 --> 01:02:17.80
okay, and then cut right through and then ask later, there are questions.

790
01:02:17.80 --> 01:02:21.80
And one of the situations, this is long time ago,

791
01:02:21.80 --> 01:02:25.80
there was a guy, a guy came into the gym.

792
01:02:25.80 --> 01:02:26.80
And just, you know, he's a visitor.

793
01:02:26.80 --> 01:02:28.80
He's like, okay, you know, I've been training.

794
01:02:28.80 --> 01:02:30.80
You know, I'm a jujitsu guy, and I've been this.

795
01:02:30.80 --> 01:02:33.80
And you know how, a lot of like visitors might say that kind of stuff.

796
01:02:33.80 --> 01:02:37.80
You know, like, it's almost comparable with the guy who's just like a 500 street fight.

797
01:02:37.80 --> 01:02:40.80
You know, it's almost like that behaviors comparable to that.

798
01:02:40.80 --> 01:02:42.80
And he's like, yeah, you know, I'm, you know,

799
01:02:42.80 --> 01:02:46.80
I'm, I forget what he said, but he was real ambiguous about his training,

800
01:02:46.80 --> 01:02:48.80
but he implied that he had a lot.

801
01:02:48.80 --> 01:02:53.80
And I remember thinking, like, all this, this guy, what he said still leaves a huge question mark of how

802
01:02:53.80 --> 01:02:57.80
an experience this person is in, you're just looking at me go, what belt are you in

803
01:02:57.80 --> 01:02:58.80
jujitsu?

804
01:02:58.80 --> 01:03:01.80
Because like, he, because he mentioned the jujitsu, right?

805
01:03:01.80 --> 01:03:05.80
And he let him talk and he finished his whole spiel about his, you know,

806
01:03:05.80 --> 01:03:08.80
experience, you're like straight up dead, dead pen.

807
01:03:08.80 --> 01:03:10.80
What belt are you in jujitsu?

808
01:03:10.80 --> 01:03:13.80
And he was like, oh, well, I don't have a belt or whatever.

809
01:03:13.80 --> 01:03:14.80
Walk away.

810
01:03:14.80 --> 01:03:15.80
Yeah.

811
01:03:15.80 --> 01:03:16.80
No.

812
01:03:16.80 --> 01:03:21.80
When you did it like a couple other times, which is no offense to people that don't have a belt.

813
01:03:21.80 --> 01:03:24.80
Because there's people that don't have any belt in jujitsu and they're awesome,

814
01:03:24.80 --> 01:03:27.80
but there must have been other characteristics about this guy that let me think about that.

815
01:03:27.80 --> 01:03:30.80
It totally wasn't about that.

816
01:03:30.80 --> 01:03:32.80
It wasn't about what belt he was.

817
01:03:32.80 --> 01:03:34.80
It was about he was being ambiguous with his training.

818
01:03:34.80 --> 01:03:38.80
And he mentioned jujitsu that he had training in jujitsu, so you want to take a look,

819
01:03:38.80 --> 01:03:41.80
maybe get a little bit of clarification, but it was real direct.

820
01:03:41.80 --> 01:03:46.80
I was like, oh, they gave him those three minutes of talking to Biggie got through with that.

821
01:03:46.80 --> 01:03:48.80
That he was a jujitsu guy.

822
01:03:48.80 --> 01:03:49.80
Yeah, sure.

823
01:03:49.80 --> 01:03:50.80
Yeah.

824
01:03:50.80 --> 01:03:53.80
Yeah.

825
01:03:53.80 --> 01:03:57.80
Some actors appear ambiguous because they have internal divisions.

826
01:03:57.80 --> 01:04:00.80
Multiple internal centers of power or both.

827
01:04:00.80 --> 01:04:05.80
This includes national governments reflecting the internal political competition taking place within them.

828
01:04:05.80 --> 01:04:08.80
These actors often do not speak with a single voice from the outside.

829
01:04:08.80 --> 01:04:12.80
Their intentions can appear confusing or conflicting.

830
01:04:12.80 --> 01:04:15.80
This happens in every organization.

831
01:04:15.80 --> 01:04:19.80
You know, you get the answer from mom gives a different answer than dad.

832
01:04:19.80 --> 01:04:20.80
Wow.

833
01:04:20.80 --> 01:04:23.80
And it's confusing.

834
01:04:23.80 --> 01:04:30.80
Just as war fighting states, uncertainty is a perve, oh, this whole section is called uncertainty.

835
01:04:30.80 --> 01:04:38.80
uncertainty is a pervasive trait of war. It is also a pervasive trait of competition.

836
01:04:38.80 --> 01:04:45.80
We make estimates of our competitors designs and act accordingly.

837
01:04:45.80 --> 01:04:51.80
Now, what's been funny about this is, I talked to a lot of clients about this.

838
01:04:51.80 --> 01:04:55.80
What you have to do and what the Marine Corps is talking about right there is take a guess.

839
01:04:55.80 --> 01:04:57.80
And no one wants to hear that.

840
01:04:57.80 --> 01:05:01.80
Even the Marine Corps didn't want to use that. They say make estimates of our competitors designs and act accordingly.

841
01:05:01.80 --> 01:05:04.80
What does that mean? It means take a guess at what you're going to do.

842
01:05:04.80 --> 01:05:08.80
Take a guess at what they're going to do and then take a guess at what you should do afterwards.

843
01:05:08.80 --> 01:05:13.80
Uncertainty in international relations cannot be eliminated.

844
01:05:13.80 --> 01:05:19.80
It is nonlinear meaning that a small amount of uncertainty can have a large effect on the situation.

845
01:05:19.80 --> 01:05:28.80
What we're dealing with it means one is also dealing with risk. Often a competitor's goal is to use ambiguity to inject uncertainty

846
01:05:28.80 --> 01:05:35.80
uncertainty into a situation. So the rival has a take to act using it to take incremental steps toward their ultimate goal.

847
01:05:35.80 --> 01:05:41.80
This approach is known as gradualism or salami slicing.

848
01:05:41.80 --> 01:05:46.80
It's interesting that the Marine Corps decided to throw salami slicing into which I've never, I've never heard that term before.

849
01:05:46.80 --> 01:05:51.80
That's what Charles. No, not in this context. In any context. I mean other than making a sandwich.

850
01:05:51.80 --> 01:05:53.80
Yes. Okay. Then no.

851
01:05:53.80 --> 01:05:57.80
Yes. So we get this approach known as gradualism or salami slicing.

852
01:05:57.80 --> 01:06:01.80
Which is each step taken is by itself so small.

853
01:06:01.80 --> 01:06:04.80
It does not cause a significant reaction from the opposing group.

854
01:06:04.80 --> 01:06:09.80
Eventually the sum of small steps were result in reaching the goal.

855
01:06:09.80 --> 01:06:22.80
Now what's important about this is look, there's two things that you should we should be learning from every one of these techniques that we hear.

856
01:06:22.80 --> 01:06:26.80
One is what do we need to look out for and one is what can we utilize?

857
01:06:26.80 --> 01:06:29.80
Right. So yes, we want to use gradualism.

858
01:06:29.80 --> 01:06:32.80
I know. Ecco doesn't really notice that I'm doing this.

859
01:06:32.80 --> 01:06:41.80
I'm adding a little bit every day. This little thing I'm making this little adjustment. Next thing you know ecco looks up and things totally changed and there's he didn't even notice it happening.

860
01:06:41.80 --> 01:06:46.80
Boiling the frog, right? The water that the frog doesn't notice that the water is getting hot.

861
01:06:46.80 --> 01:06:52.80
So we want to know to utilize that as a technique as a strategy.

862
01:06:52.80 --> 01:06:54.80
We also need to know to look out for it.

863
01:06:54.80 --> 01:06:57.80
And ecco's making these little adjustments. I got to hey, ecco.

864
01:06:57.80 --> 01:07:00.80
That's four days in a row. You did this. What's that? What are you trying to do? What are you trying to get?

865
01:07:00.80 --> 01:07:03.80
What are you trying to make happen? It's going on.

866
01:07:03.80 --> 01:07:10.80
Bro, salami slicing is literally another expression like for boiling. Yes, rock.

867
01:07:10.80 --> 01:07:13.80
Like seeing a deal a bit at a time.

868
01:07:13.80 --> 01:07:24.80
Actors also make use of ambiguity and uncertainty to cause enough hesitation so they can reach their goal while their competitor tries to make sense of the situation.

869
01:07:24.80 --> 01:07:33.80
I love that love that. It's almost interesting that the Marine Corps doesn't talk about we need to utilize these things.

870
01:07:33.80 --> 01:07:40.80
And it's also very interesting how two times in this one paragraph they talk about hesitation.

871
01:07:40.80 --> 01:07:50.80
Because hesitation, hesitation kills, hesitation is is waiting and reacting instead of making things happen.

872
01:07:50.80 --> 01:08:00.80
And just using these techniques to get people to rotate. Just get them to hesitate a little bit. Good move. We like that move.

873
01:08:00.80 --> 01:08:04.80
There's also as I listen to this.

874
01:08:04.80 --> 01:08:10.80
It's it's crazy how similar this is to so many things that you have said just on the podcast counts at times.

875
01:08:10.80 --> 01:08:15.80
If you just kind of change the view of this is uncertainty with your opponent that if you change the lens a little bit,

876
01:08:15.80 --> 01:08:23.80
just in leadership in general in any situation even with your own team. I think it says something like what was the quote you have to take a guess.

877
01:08:23.80 --> 01:08:29.80
They had some fancy word for that guess what you don't know the future. So should we make some big massive move 50.

878
01:08:29.80 --> 01:08:35.80
No, why don't we just and you talk about incremental decision making because we actually don't know what's going on.

879
01:08:35.80 --> 01:08:40.80
I guess that's what Salam is slicing is one little step at a time. It allows you to react to what's going on.

880
01:08:40.80 --> 01:08:49.80
And even how the way you talk about that from a leadership perspective, it's not a big stretch to go from this description of the Marine Corps and a competitor to just you and a leadership role.

881
01:08:49.80 --> 01:08:54.80
You don't have a crystal ball. You don't know the future. Don't fall in with your plan.

882
01:08:54.80 --> 01:09:05.80
Just take steps just salami slicing steps in a row and you will actually get to where you need to be with so much less conflict than if you say we have to take this giant move all the way to the end right now.

883
01:09:05.80 --> 01:09:15.80
Yeah, and you're a degree off and by the end you're 100 degrees off. Yeah, my reputation for being a decisive leader and I cheated.

884
01:09:15.80 --> 01:09:20.80
I cheat. I'm super decisive, but I cheat because I only make little tiny decisions, but no one knows that.

885
01:09:20.80 --> 01:09:27.80
They're just like, oh, he made the decision quick. It's like, oh, yeah, because it's a little tiny decision with almost no risk, but we're going to do it immediately and then we're going to get feedback and we're going to figure out what to do next.

886
01:09:27.80 --> 01:09:33.80
And I'll make that decision quickly as well. So I'm going to make decisions very quickly, but they're little decisions.

887
01:09:33.80 --> 01:09:38.80
And I'm going to make them rapidly. And that's how I'm going to beat you. I guess, Jocca's a salami slice.

888
01:09:38.80 --> 01:09:40.80
I'm going to bring it all up in the place.

889
01:09:40.80 --> 01:09:49.80
But it's time the competitor figures it out. The goal is achieved, which is called feet, a company, something already done.

890
01:09:49.80 --> 01:09:53.80
Little thing here called boundary stretching.

891
01:09:53.80 --> 01:10:06.80
Boundary or threshold stretching occurs when an actor uses measures short of war to force movement or change in the nature of a boundary to gain greater regional influence access and control.

892
01:10:06.80 --> 01:10:08.80
Oh, man.

893
01:10:08.80 --> 01:10:12.80
Man as a leader, you're always dealing with motion that boundary on you.

894
01:10:12.80 --> 01:10:14.80
Right? They're just, oh, sorry. It was a little bit late.

895
01:10:14.80 --> 01:10:15.80
Yeah.

896
01:10:15.80 --> 01:10:17.80
That go a little bit.

897
01:10:17.80 --> 01:10:18.80
That's a little bit, right?

898
01:10:18.80 --> 01:10:20.80
A little boundary stretch.

899
01:10:20.80 --> 01:10:23.80
If two minutes is okay, maybe three minutes are good to go.

900
01:10:23.80 --> 01:10:26.80
What's funny is that's absolutely true with being late.

901
01:10:26.80 --> 01:10:29.80
I come from a long line of late people. We all know that.

902
01:10:29.80 --> 01:10:35.80
But yeah, like if I was one minute late and I didn't hear about it, like, okay, cool.

903
01:10:35.80 --> 01:10:37.80
One minute is kind of the standard.

904
01:10:37.80 --> 01:10:45.80
It's more subconscious, but it's like when you're running like one minute late, whatever, the next time, you don't feel that stress at all.

905
01:10:45.80 --> 01:10:48.80
You're like, oh, I was one minute late before nothing. So no problem, right?

906
01:10:48.80 --> 01:10:51.80
Then you're like a minute half two minutes, three minutes, and then you kind of like pro.

907
01:10:51.80 --> 01:10:53.80
You know, you're kind of like, wait, am I going to hear about it?

908
01:10:53.80 --> 01:10:54.80
No.

909
01:10:54.80 --> 01:10:55.80
Oh, that's no problem.

910
01:10:55.80 --> 01:11:01.80
Then obviously, there's a pretty solid threshold of lateness that I can kind of exist in, you know?

911
01:11:01.80 --> 01:11:06.80
And then when you get the 10 minutes, 20 minutes late, then you start here by, it's okay.

912
01:11:06.80 --> 01:11:07.80
I know.

913
01:11:07.80 --> 01:11:08.80
I know what the boundary is.

914
01:11:08.80 --> 01:11:09.80
I'm sorry.

915
01:11:09.80 --> 01:11:10.80
Exactly right.

916
01:11:10.80 --> 01:11:11.80
A bit you will line stepper.

917
01:11:11.80 --> 01:11:16.80
That might be a different thing, but yeah.

918
01:11:16.80 --> 01:11:23.80
By boundary, we mean the limit of a limit of some kind that if crossed would normally trigger a significant reaction.

919
01:11:23.80 --> 01:11:31.80
But before the boundary stretching events occur, most people would assume crossing a red line would cause a violent response of some kind.

920
01:11:31.80 --> 01:11:38.80
The goal of the actor using boundary stretching is to achieve their goals in such a way that a response is not triggered.

921
01:11:38.80 --> 01:11:43.80
Or if a response happens, it does not result in a state of war between the two actors.

922
01:11:43.80 --> 01:11:47.80
When this happens, we often see a new limit established.

923
01:11:47.80 --> 01:11:49.80
The boundary has been stretched.

924
01:11:49.80 --> 01:11:50.80
You've got to be careful with this.

925
01:11:50.80 --> 01:11:53.80
Hey, in a leadership position, you're going to have people doing this.

926
01:11:53.80 --> 01:11:55.80
This is 247 from your troops.

927
01:11:55.80 --> 01:11:56.80
They're stretching those boundaries.

928
01:11:56.80 --> 01:11:59.80
And what you have to do is you have to be consistent.

929
01:11:59.80 --> 01:12:01.80
You have to be consistent.

930
01:12:01.80 --> 01:12:03.80
You can't.

931
01:12:03.80 --> 01:12:08.80
And look, I'm not saying it's like, no, slack, you don't know nothing.

932
01:12:08.80 --> 01:12:10.80
No way, you're one minute late.

933
01:12:10.80 --> 01:12:16.80
But if you let that line stepping become habitual, it will develop into a problem.

934
01:12:16.80 --> 01:12:21.80
So you and will the way that you, this is what's good.

935
01:12:21.80 --> 01:12:24.80
First of all, you don't draw lines in the sand.

936
01:12:24.80 --> 01:12:26.80
Which I got asked to question about this the other day.

937
01:12:26.80 --> 01:12:28.80
Like, how often would you draw lines in the sand?

938
01:12:28.80 --> 01:12:31.80
It's very, very seldom do I draw lines in the sand?

939
01:12:31.80 --> 01:12:33.80
The cross this line, you do not.

940
01:12:33.80 --> 01:12:34.80
Right?

941
01:12:34.80 --> 01:12:36.80
We're not doing that.

942
01:12:36.80 --> 01:12:44.80
Now, is there a burger to things that if you cross, you're going to, like, it's going to be a real problem.

943
01:12:44.80 --> 01:12:47.80
But that's a real significant thing.

944
01:12:47.80 --> 01:12:50.80
So here's what we're talking about minimum force required.

945
01:12:50.80 --> 01:12:53.80
Minimum force required is good.

946
01:12:53.80 --> 01:12:57.80
It's a good way to keep the boundary stretching and check.

947
01:12:57.80 --> 01:13:04.80
So if you look, the punishment for being late is, you know, your pay is docked for a week.

948
01:13:04.80 --> 01:13:08.80
And you're one minute late. Do I necessarily need to dock your pay?

949
01:13:08.80 --> 01:13:10.80
No, but can I just let it go?

950
01:13:10.80 --> 01:13:16.80
No. I give you a appropriate response.

951
01:13:16.80 --> 01:13:20.80
Hey, echo. You know what the punishment is for being late, right?

952
01:13:20.80 --> 01:13:24.80
Because you were a minute late today and look, that's a one week.

953
01:13:24.80 --> 01:13:26.80
No pay. You know that, right?

954
01:13:26.80 --> 01:13:30.80
Yeah, I know. Okay, I'll just make an sure because, I mean, time is time.

955
01:13:30.80 --> 01:13:36.80
And I know you come from a long line of people that are late, but sometime we got to take ownership of that.

956
01:13:36.80 --> 01:13:42.80
We got to be on time. So when people start to stretch the boundaries, you push them back.

957
01:13:42.80 --> 01:13:49.80
You push them back in there, not with violence of action, but with the subtlest form of leadership.

958
01:13:49.80 --> 01:13:53.80
And the minimum force that you can to get them back in the way they know that they cross the line.

959
01:13:53.80 --> 01:13:55.80
And that it's not okay.

960
01:13:55.80 --> 01:13:56.80
Yeah.

961
01:13:56.80 --> 01:14:06.80
So actually let me ask you this. Okay. So my, look, my boss supervisor, whatever.

962
01:14:06.80 --> 01:14:12.80
When I did hear about it, he would, I see what he was trying to do. I think he was trying to do that.

963
01:14:12.80 --> 01:14:15.80
Right, the minimum. But he'd almost like giggle about it.

964
01:14:15.80 --> 01:14:17.80
Yeah. Like, oh, you're late.

965
01:14:17.80 --> 01:14:24.80
And I'm thinking back on my feelings about it where it, it caused me to not take it seriously, because like we were both laughing at it kind of like,

966
01:14:24.80 --> 01:14:26.80
Yeah. So more force was required.

967
01:14:26.80 --> 01:14:27.80
Yeah.

968
01:14:27.80 --> 01:14:33.80
He didn't maybe like a twist of like just don't giggle about it. Just be like, hey, I agree with you.

969
01:14:33.80 --> 01:14:36.80
I'm just not a huge deal, but you're in guy.

970
01:14:36.80 --> 01:14:38.80
Guy, I think it was at the master.

971
01:14:38.80 --> 01:14:40.80
He's like, you know, I'm a funny guy.

972
01:14:40.80 --> 01:14:42.80
I like to joke around a lot.

973
01:14:42.80 --> 01:14:46.80
And you know, I like to crack jokes. I've always been kind of the class clown kind of guy.

974
01:14:46.80 --> 01:14:49.80
And you know, sometimes it seems like my people aren't taking me seriously.

975
01:14:49.80 --> 01:14:52.80
And I was like, bro, okay, do we need to go on with this?

976
01:14:52.80 --> 01:14:56.80
Or are we just going to stop making jokes when it's not appropriate? How's that sound?

977
01:14:56.80 --> 01:15:03.80
So yes, it's not appropriate. If you're trying to now listen, hey, what about when I joke with you if you're late?

978
01:15:03.80 --> 01:15:07.80
Like, you're on one side, right? It's like, I'm going to be honest.

979
01:15:07.80 --> 01:15:08.80
It's the same thing.

980
01:15:08.80 --> 01:15:09.80
Same thing.

981
01:15:09.80 --> 01:15:10.80
But the thing is I'm not really late.

982
01:15:10.80 --> 01:15:13.80
Yeah, no, it's about example. Everyone thinks you're everyone thinks you're late.

983
01:15:13.80 --> 01:15:15.80
Now because I talk so much smack to you.

984
01:15:15.80 --> 01:15:16.80
Like, I have people on the floor.

985
01:15:16.80 --> 01:15:18.80
I'm like, what about when it goes late?

986
01:15:18.80 --> 01:15:18.80
Yeah.

987
01:15:18.80 --> 01:15:23.80
Like, well, actually, and I had to say this the other day, I'm like, actually, because I was like, what do you do with echoing these late all the time?

988
01:15:23.80 --> 01:15:25.80
And I go, actually, he's not late all the time. Just kidding.

989
01:15:25.80 --> 01:15:28.80
So guess what? What does that tell you?

990
01:15:28.80 --> 01:15:30.80
You're sitting here saying all the jokes don't really affect me.

991
01:15:30.80 --> 01:15:33.80
They do affect you and they affect you perfectly because you're not late.

992
01:15:33.80 --> 01:15:37.80
Because you know that little bit of ribbing is just enough to let you know we don't,

993
01:15:37.80 --> 01:15:38.80
we're not late around here, right?

994
01:15:38.80 --> 01:15:40.80
We're not late for the podcast.

995
01:15:40.80 --> 01:15:44.80
Yeah, and that's not to mention that you and Dave Burke, good deal.

996
01:15:44.80 --> 01:15:53.80
Dave have effectively and successfully, by the way, cultivated an atmosphere of late being a for real bad thing.

997
01:15:53.80 --> 01:15:58.80
Because on quite late, it's not necessarily a bad thing.

998
01:15:58.80 --> 01:16:04.80
I'm not saying it's a good thing, but I'm saying it's not under most, you know, a lot of circumstances like this bad thing to be late.

999
01:16:04.80 --> 01:16:08.80
It's sort of like we got other things going on, and we all kind of know that.

1000
01:16:08.80 --> 01:16:11.80
Let's just say the culture isn't cultivated the way it is here.

1001
01:16:11.80 --> 01:16:23.80
We'll say that. It's cultivated. It's cultivated in a way where a lot of us make psychological mental, physical adjustments that may accommodate these things.

1002
01:16:23.80 --> 01:16:26.80
You don't want to do happen.

1003
01:16:26.80 --> 01:16:30.80
On a slight beam we're serious, no, if I can ruin this for a second.

1004
01:16:30.80 --> 01:16:37.80
There's actually another reason why when you were talking about escalation, the counseling, why the first part of, hey, are you okay?

1005
01:16:37.80 --> 01:16:45.80
Hey, what's going on? There's another reason why that is, especially if that is actually a thing you actually mean that it's not like some game you're playing to like, hey, bro.

1006
01:16:45.80 --> 01:16:48.80
But it should, it should better be something.

1007
01:16:48.80 --> 01:16:49.80
Yeah, it should be.

1008
01:16:49.80 --> 01:16:54.80
It's not even if you're, no, if you don't mean, hey, bro, you okay, you relate is everything alright.

1009
01:16:54.80 --> 01:16:59.80
If you don't mean that, you're just doing a little manipulation on your, no, you're not, you're not a good leader.

1010
01:16:59.80 --> 01:17:00.80
Exactly.

1011
01:17:00.80 --> 01:17:10.80
But that first step of that, which is rather than go right to the, hey, you broke the rules. Here's the paper you got assigned to the, you buy it in the rules. It's, it's, it's partially my wife's, hey, I'm paying attention to this. This is important to me.

1012
01:17:10.80 --> 01:17:17.80
But it's my way of letting you know, this is important not because I want you to be on time, but because I want to know what's going on with you.

1013
01:17:17.80 --> 01:17:22.80
You now know, hey, Dave's paying attention to this stuff. And so by me saying, hey, echo, man, everything cool at home.

1014
01:17:22.80 --> 01:17:26.80
Isn't the mental, due to of, don't ever be late.

1015
01:17:26.80 --> 01:17:32.80
It's actually, you realize like, this guy actually is paying attention to my life and cares about my life in a, in a positive way.

1016
01:17:32.80 --> 01:17:38.80
That if I get to get to step three, you don't, you don't, you don't, everyone, you don't want that to happen.

1017
01:17:38.80 --> 01:17:42.80
You don't want to put me in that spot because you know, I care about you. I'm, hey, man, what's going on?

1018
01:17:42.80 --> 01:17:45.80
How about going to get to level three and you're not assigned a paperwork?

1019
01:17:45.80 --> 01:17:55.80
I mean, come on, bro, like what's going on here? And the starting with that accomplishes a lot and just exactly what you're saying was my point is if you actually care and paying attention to that,

1020
01:17:55.80 --> 01:18:01.80
that other person sees that. You go, oh, dude, Dave's, Dave's got my best interest in mine, not like he cares about the one mind.

1021
01:18:01.80 --> 01:18:07.80
It's not even about that. It's, there's other pieces of that in the escalation, the counseling of me paying attention to what's going on in your world.

1022
01:18:07.80 --> 01:18:12.80
Because chances are, if we're on the same page, you'd be in late, there actually probably is something going on in your world.

1023
01:18:12.80 --> 01:18:14.80
Or else you wouldn't be late.

1024
01:18:14.80 --> 01:18:19.80
That's so true. Look, so this might be, no, I think this is a good example.

1025
01:18:19.80 --> 01:18:26.80
So when I lived in Honolulu, Irana, technically, I already yellowed light, but it was one of those, like I pushed it.

1026
01:18:26.80 --> 01:18:32.80
You know, the kind of like, I had, it was probably more appropriate to stop than run, you know, you just, anyway.

1027
01:18:32.80 --> 01:18:35.80
So I do that, get pulled over.

1028
01:18:35.80 --> 01:18:36.80
Hmm.

1029
01:18:36.80 --> 01:18:40.80
Cops looking at me, and of course, he explains it to me. I'm trying to play it off.

1030
01:18:40.80 --> 01:18:50.80
Oh, well, it was yellow, all good. He was like, but he, that's how he acted the way you're talking to, where he'd be like, hey, he didn't give me, he gave me a little warning.

1031
01:18:50.80 --> 01:19:02.80
But he was like, he cared, you know, so he was like, he's like, I get it, you know, you want to, you don't want to stop the red light, I get it whatever he's like, but man, like, I don't want, I don't want to have to give you a ticket, you know, for running red lights.

1032
01:19:02.80 --> 01:19:04.80
And I for sure don't want any accidents happening.

1033
01:19:04.80 --> 01:19:21.80
And, you know, I don't want to be in that spot to have to do that to you, you know, as far as it's taking it goes. But that's how he was talking to me. And I remember thinking, bro, you're so right. I'm so sorry, you know, I will never do it again for us, you know, like, it's really that feeling that I got from the guy, he let me go. He could have gave me a ticket.

1034
01:19:21.80 --> 01:19:32.80
And I would have been a man, I'm sorry, I'll never do it again. Like, that's the way he talked to me. If he gave you a ticket, you would have been angry. Maybe he might have been, I'm going to run right on that cross.

1035
01:19:32.80 --> 01:19:43.80
If he had a bad attitude or an attitude that let's say I didn't like, then yeah, for sure, but his attitude was the thing that won me over. Of course, not getting a ticket is a thing for sure.

1036
01:19:43.80 --> 01:20:02.80
The way he talked to me, it made me like, we'll say, it compelled compliance in a very nice way. Jack, case and point, you know, for example, fluidity, next section, fluidity disorder complexity.

1037
01:20:02.80 --> 01:20:14.80
While interest usually remains stable for long periods of time, okay, that's important, right? We normally, we focus on the same thing for a long period of time. The ways and means groups used to reach them can't change constantly.

1038
01:20:14.80 --> 01:20:29.80
The efforts by groups to try different approaches produces fluidity, while each action changes the environment as well. Once again, this is Udalupe, right? We got a, every action you take changes the situation.

1039
01:20:29.80 --> 01:20:41.80
Actors see the new structure and adapt to it. Changes that often increase the level, this changes that often increase the level of disorder.

1040
01:20:41.80 --> 01:20:53.80
So, every little move you make creates a change and then you adapt to that it creates another change. This is constantly happening. We change the system whenever we interact with it often in unpredictable ways.

1041
01:20:53.80 --> 01:21:03.80
That's the way it goes. These factors and their constant change create a great deal of complexity in the environment.

1042
01:21:03.80 --> 01:21:13.80
This complexity also is also systemic and therefore non-linear. As small changes in one aspect of competition can cause big impacts in other areas.

1043
01:21:13.80 --> 01:21:23.80
Because change is a constant and actors continually adapt to changes in an effort to achieve competitive advantages, complexity runs throughout the competition continuum.

1044
01:21:23.80 --> 01:21:26.80
And I read all that so I could read this.

1045
01:21:26.80 --> 01:21:32.80
I read all of that so I could read this. Marines must learn to thrive in this environment.

1046
01:21:32.80 --> 01:21:42.80
And I read that in order to say this instead of trying to create order in the vain hope of avoiding complexity.

1047
01:21:42.80 --> 01:21:50.80
So, all the, there's look, things are going to change. The adaptions you make to change is going to cause even more change.

1048
01:21:50.80 --> 01:21:55.80
Change is going to happen randomly. It's going to be complex. It's non-linear. All these things are changing.

1049
01:21:55.80 --> 01:22:01.80
And you have to learn how to thrive in that environment. Is that a saying no way? Keep it the way it was.

1050
01:22:01.80 --> 01:22:08.80
Just keep things the way they were. Keep on that same path. We can't change. We can't change. That's a vain hope.

1051
01:22:08.80 --> 01:22:18.80
The human dimension. In case all that didn't cause enough chaos, there's the human dimension.

1052
01:22:18.80 --> 01:22:24.80
As the nation's force in readiness. Once again, the Marine Corps.

1053
01:22:24.80 --> 01:22:30.80
Just making sure everybody knows as the nation's force in readiness.

1054
01:22:30.80 --> 01:22:40.80
Marines will often find themselves involved in competitions that are close to the threshold of violence. The threat of violence, this section is.

1055
01:22:40.80 --> 01:22:50.80
The threat of violence acts on the human brain in much the same way as experiencing actual violence acts on it.

1056
01:22:50.80 --> 01:22:56.80
The two are not synonymous. Because actually experiencing violence is clearly more coercive than the threat of it.

1057
01:22:56.80 --> 01:23:11.80
Yet, we must be aware of how the threat of violence affects human decision making because even its threat can cause a physical and emotional response in people.

1058
01:23:11.80 --> 01:23:25.80
This increases the potential for misjudgment overreaction in other mistakes. It could also be a, it could also be a source of competitive advantage for those who can control their emotions in the heat of the moment.

1059
01:23:25.80 --> 01:23:33.80
It can make sound decisions. Mom, what? What? This is what's interesting here.

1060
01:23:33.80 --> 01:23:41.80
Okay, obviously you got what's on the surface, which the face of it is listen. Even the threat of violence can make people freak out.

1061
01:23:41.80 --> 01:23:46.80
Violence will definitely make or can definitely make people freak out.

1062
01:23:46.80 --> 01:23:58.80
So you've got to realize that the threat of violence can make people freak out. Here's what's interesting when you throw the influence continuum over this.

1063
01:23:58.80 --> 01:24:04.80
Me, barking the order at Dave, you know what Dave shut up and do what I told you to do.

1064
01:24:04.80 --> 01:24:10.80
That creates an emotional response from you. And it's not a good one.

1065
01:24:10.80 --> 01:24:25.80
Taking away someone's control over their destiny, taking away their ownership from them, imposing your will onto someone creates an emotional reaction in many cases.

1066
01:24:25.80 --> 01:24:33.80
And by the way, if I work for Dave and Dave imposes his will on me and I allow it to make me mad on being weak.

1067
01:24:33.80 --> 01:24:41.80
It's causing the emotional response to me and he'd be like, okay, you know what? Dave is just he can't he doesn't have a good plan and he's forcing this plan on top of me. Okay, got it.

1068
01:24:41.80 --> 01:24:47.80
I'm going to go to the best I can with it. That's the right attitude to have just like if someone's trying to get violent with me.

1069
01:24:47.80 --> 01:24:51.80
If I freak out and get emotional, that's a problem.

1070
01:24:51.80 --> 01:24:53.80
You look confused, echoed Charles.

1071
01:24:53.80 --> 01:24:56.80
No, sir, makes sense to me.

1072
01:24:56.80 --> 01:24:59.80
Okay.

1073
01:24:59.80 --> 01:25:02.80
Detach from your emotions.

1074
01:25:02.80 --> 01:25:06.80
Now we get into this.

1075
01:25:06.80 --> 01:25:14.80
A nation's culture and it's effect on how people think also affects the choices they make.

1076
01:25:14.80 --> 01:25:21.80
For example, some cultures promote holistic thinking while others value a more analytical thought process.

1077
01:25:21.80 --> 01:25:29.80
Some value action, which can create an implicit bias toward regularly choosing the most aggressive course of action.

1078
01:25:29.80 --> 01:25:33.80
The list of potential cultural influences is a long one.

1079
01:25:33.80 --> 01:25:40.80
Thus, cultural have an impact on many aspects of competition, including decision making and how information is perceived.

1080
01:25:40.80 --> 01:25:46.80
Understanding the human dimension of competition is an area needing constant study by marines.

1081
01:25:46.80 --> 01:25:54.80
So, so hey marines and hey everyone else in the world, you better understand human beings and human nature.

1082
01:25:54.80 --> 01:25:57.80
That's what you need to do.

1083
01:25:57.80 --> 01:26:01.80
Now you know what I love about this.

1084
01:26:01.80 --> 01:26:03.80
Think about this.

1085
01:26:03.80 --> 01:26:07.80
Team leaders, CEOs, business people of the world.

1086
01:26:07.80 --> 01:26:09.80
Think about this.

1087
01:26:09.80 --> 01:26:12.80
If a nation's culture affects how you think and the choices you make,

1088
01:26:12.80 --> 01:26:14.80
guess what's going on inside your business.

1089
01:26:14.80 --> 01:26:21.80
If you haven't developed the culture that you want to drive people to make the decisions that you want them to make,

1090
01:26:21.80 --> 01:26:23.80
you're letting that fly out the window.

1091
01:26:23.80 --> 01:26:27.80
You're leaving it up the chance to what Dave thinks Dave should do.

1092
01:26:27.80 --> 01:26:29.80
I don't want Dave to think about what Dave should do.

1093
01:26:29.80 --> 01:26:32.80
I want Dave to think, oh yeah, you know what?

1094
01:26:32.80 --> 01:26:35.80
I know that in this company we take care of our clients.

1095
01:26:35.80 --> 01:26:36.80
Okay, got it.

1096
01:26:36.80 --> 01:26:40.80
When the client calls up and has a complaint or wants something or need something, Dave doesn't go,

1097
01:26:40.80 --> 01:26:41.80
you know what I'm off the clock right now.

1098
01:26:41.80 --> 01:26:42.80
Sorry, can't help you.

1099
01:26:42.80 --> 01:26:44.80
No, Dave goes, hey, what do you need?

1100
01:26:44.80 --> 01:26:45.80
How can I help you?

1101
01:26:45.80 --> 01:26:47.80
We're here, we're here to help.

1102
01:26:47.80 --> 01:26:49.80
That's what we do.

1103
01:26:49.80 --> 01:26:54.80
So if you run an organization or you're part of an organization,

1104
01:26:54.80 --> 01:26:59.80
that culture, if you don't focus on that culture, you are wasting your time,

1105
01:26:59.80 --> 01:27:02.80
you're wasting your efforts, and I have you,

1106
01:27:02.80 --> 01:27:06.80
wasting this around work, you're hurting your efficiency is what you're doing.

1107
01:27:06.80 --> 01:27:09.80
Look, we talked about this on the debrief podcast,

1108
01:27:09.80 --> 01:27:11.80
and I talked about it on the F online.

1109
01:27:11.80 --> 01:27:17.80
The highest form of decentralized command is culture.

1110
01:27:17.80 --> 01:27:23.80
If you have, if everyone in the organization understands what the culture is,

1111
01:27:23.80 --> 01:27:26.80
they can make decisions all day long.

1112
01:27:26.80 --> 01:27:32.80
They can make 99.9% of decisions based on just knowing what the culture is.

1113
01:27:32.80 --> 01:27:36.80
And when people don't understand the culture, inside your organization,

1114
01:27:36.80 --> 01:27:38.80
that's when they do the stuff that makes you go,

1115
01:27:38.80 --> 01:27:40.80
what the hell was Dave thinking?

1116
01:27:40.80 --> 01:27:42.80
What was Dave thinking?

1117
01:27:42.80 --> 01:27:46.80
What was that frontline cash register individual thinking?

1118
01:27:46.80 --> 01:27:49.80
When they did that?

1119
01:27:49.80 --> 01:27:50.80
What was that?

1120
01:27:50.80 --> 01:27:51.80
Whatever.

1121
01:27:51.80 --> 01:27:52.80
You name it.

1122
01:27:52.80 --> 01:27:54.80
What was that frontline person thinking?

1123
01:27:54.80 --> 01:27:55.80
What the hell did they do that?

1124
01:27:55.80 --> 01:27:56.80
Wow, that's crazy.

1125
01:27:56.80 --> 01:28:01.80
It's because you haven't built the culture that guides their actions.

1126
01:28:01.80 --> 01:28:11.80
Invest in your culture.

1127
01:28:11.80 --> 01:28:13.80
Build it.

1128
01:28:13.80 --> 01:28:16.80
Make it part of everything that you do.

1129
01:28:16.80 --> 01:28:17.80
And you know what?

1130
01:28:17.80 --> 01:28:19.80
Had to answer this question day on a F online, somebody asked me like,

1131
01:28:19.80 --> 01:28:21.80
how do you do a good job?

1132
01:28:21.80 --> 01:28:22.80
Not doing a good job.

1133
01:28:22.80 --> 01:28:24.80
A build and culture.

1134
01:28:24.80 --> 01:28:26.80
What stories are you telling?

1135
01:28:26.80 --> 01:28:27.80
To the team.

1136
01:28:27.80 --> 01:28:29.80
That's where culture comes from, by the way.

1137
01:28:29.80 --> 01:28:31.80
That's where it comes from.

1138
01:28:31.80 --> 01:28:36.80
Is the stories that fuel the culture?

1139
01:28:36.80 --> 01:28:39.80
Stories fuel the culture of your organization.

1140
01:28:39.80 --> 01:28:42.80
And if you want people, if you want to develop a culture,

1141
01:28:42.80 --> 01:28:46.80
if you want the stories to back it up, that's what the Marine Corps does in such an outstanding way.

1142
01:28:46.80 --> 01:28:48.80
I got this thing I'm going to cover on the podcast.

1143
01:28:48.80 --> 01:28:52.80
I think the name, it's a, it's a, it's a field manual.

1144
01:28:52.80 --> 01:28:55.80
Or maybe it's just a, some issue thing.

1145
01:28:55.80 --> 01:29:00.80
It's called, it's called the squad leader makes a difference.

1146
01:29:00.80 --> 01:29:03.80
Volume one.

1147
01:29:03.80 --> 01:29:06.80
So you want to talk about how you develop a culture?

1148
01:29:06.80 --> 01:29:07.80
Well, you know what?

1149
01:29:07.80 --> 01:29:09.80
It would be nice if our, if our, if our, if our, if our, if our, if our, if our,

1150
01:29:09.80 --> 01:29:12.80
if our, if we'd be nice of our squad leaders really stepped up and made things happen.

1151
01:29:12.80 --> 01:29:13.80
Oh, cool.

1152
01:29:13.80 --> 01:29:14.80
I'm going to write a book.

1153
01:29:14.80 --> 01:29:16.80
It's called the squad leader makes a difference.

1154
01:29:16.80 --> 01:29:25.80
I'm going to highlight historical factual things that took place where the squad leader saved the division saved the battalion saved the effort saved the mission.

1155
01:29:25.80 --> 01:29:28.80
The squad leader didn't want to tell everybody in the Marine Corps.

1156
01:29:28.80 --> 01:29:30.80
That, that's what happened.

1157
01:29:30.80 --> 01:29:33.80
And guess what that new squad leader is going to think.

1158
01:29:33.80 --> 01:29:35.80
He's going to think I'm going to make a difference.

1159
01:29:35.80 --> 01:29:37.80
I'm important.

1160
01:29:37.80 --> 01:29:40.80
My decision. And this is the truth.

1161
01:29:40.80 --> 01:29:42.80
So that's what the Marine Corps does.

1162
01:29:42.80 --> 01:29:44.80
They do it.

1163
01:29:44.80 --> 01:29:48.80
They do it just in such an impeccable way.

1164
01:29:48.80 --> 01:29:50.80
And really good companies do that.

1165
01:29:50.80 --> 01:29:53.80
Well, really good companies.

1166
01:29:53.80 --> 01:29:55.80
They tell that story inside the company.

1167
01:29:55.80 --> 01:29:58.80
So everybody knows what that company is.

1168
01:29:58.80 --> 01:30:00.80
They get that culture.

1169
01:30:00.80 --> 01:30:05.80
So if you want to be build culture, you better invest in telling the story, capturing the story,

1170
01:30:05.80 --> 01:30:06.80
telling the story.

1171
01:30:06.80 --> 01:30:09.80
That's what you need to do.

1172
01:30:09.80 --> 01:30:14.80
The squad leader makes it different.

1173
01:30:14.80 --> 01:30:16.80
I might have to do that one day.

1174
01:30:16.80 --> 01:30:17.80
Such a cool.

1175
01:30:17.80 --> 01:30:23.80
It's such a perfect, such a perfect example of how you build culture.

1176
01:30:23.80 --> 01:30:25.80
You tell mythical.

1177
01:30:25.80 --> 01:30:28.80
They're not mythical. They're historical.

1178
01:30:28.80 --> 01:30:35.80
Next, the art science and dynamic of the world.

1179
01:30:35.80 --> 01:30:37.80
The world is a dynamic of competition.

1180
01:30:37.80 --> 01:30:40.80
The art science and dynamic of competition.

1181
01:30:40.80 --> 01:30:43.80
The Marine Corps as part of the joint force,

1182
01:30:43.80 --> 01:30:47.80
plays an essential role in securing national aims and conditions.

1183
01:30:47.80 --> 01:30:50.80
Sometimes regarded as outside the military sphere.

1184
01:30:50.80 --> 01:30:55.80
Competition below the threshold of armed conflict and often the lengthy

1185
01:30:55.80 --> 01:31:00.80
consolidation of gains that inevitably follows war.

1186
01:31:00.80 --> 01:31:03.80
To play this role successfully.

1187
01:31:03.80 --> 01:31:07.80
This need the ability to see and understand the competitive forces in the environment.

1188
01:31:07.80 --> 01:31:18.80
Understand what tools are available to them and be able to envision how they can contribute to a campaign of competition.

1189
01:31:18.80 --> 01:31:24.80
The Marines have to understand how they're going to contribute to a campaign of competition.

1190
01:31:24.80 --> 01:31:28.80
That takes place through this entire continuum.

1191
01:31:28.80 --> 01:31:33.80
And then the next sentence is creativity or art.

1192
01:31:33.80 --> 01:31:39.80
Is necessary to imagine different ways and means for Marines to contribute to reaching these aims.

1193
01:31:39.80 --> 01:31:41.80
Again, what's the focus in the United States Marine Corps?

1194
01:31:41.80 --> 01:31:46.80
Apparently creativity and art.

1195
01:31:46.80 --> 01:31:55.80
Constructing a set of steps along a timeline to help reach them along with the necessary feedback loops to improve performance over time.

1196
01:31:55.80 --> 01:31:59.80
Our abilities that align with the science of competition.

1197
01:31:59.80 --> 01:32:03.80
In many ways, this is nothing new.

1198
01:32:03.80 --> 01:32:04.80
And then they break it down.

1199
01:32:04.80 --> 01:32:13.80
It comes down to sizing up your opponent with a critical eye and then coming up with a creative solution that allows you to achieve your goal despite the opponent's resistance.

1200
01:32:13.80 --> 01:32:18.80
Marines have done this for ages.

1201
01:32:18.80 --> 01:32:21.80
And I think ages is a strong word.

1202
01:32:21.80 --> 01:32:30.80
I don't know. We have to look at what the definition of ages to me means longer than how old is the Marine Corps 240 years?

1203
01:32:30.80 --> 01:32:31.80
Yeah.

1204
01:32:31.80 --> 01:32:32.80
Two or four or five years.

1205
01:32:32.80 --> 01:32:33.80
Two or four or five years.

1206
01:32:33.80 --> 01:32:36.80
Ages seems a little bit bigger.

1207
01:32:36.80 --> 01:32:38.80
But you know what? The Marines is going to put that in your head.

1208
01:32:38.80 --> 01:32:39.80
You know why they're telling a story story.

1209
01:32:39.80 --> 01:32:44.80
They're developing the culture that is long as time has existed.

1210
01:32:44.80 --> 01:32:49.80
Marines have used art and creativity to figure out how to size up their opponent and crush them.

1211
01:32:49.80 --> 01:32:52.80
Yeah. And you want to be on that? You want to be part of that?

1212
01:32:52.80 --> 01:32:53.80
Yeah.

1213
01:32:53.80 --> 01:32:57.80
Yeah. I mean, this is this whole. There's so many things inside here.

1214
01:32:57.80 --> 01:33:02.80
So crazy. I was thinking of just the idea of of as a leader, the power of culture.

1215
01:33:02.80 --> 01:33:07.80
I mean, you could look at on this very tiny little selfish level of the stronger that culture is.

1216
01:33:07.80 --> 01:33:13.80
If you're in a leadership, the more free time you have, the more things will happen without you having to get involved in those things.

1217
01:33:13.80 --> 01:33:16.80
And that free time obviously is not so you can do nothing.

1218
01:33:16.80 --> 01:33:19.80
So you can think about other more long range, more strategic things.

1219
01:33:19.80 --> 01:33:24.80
And then these telling these guys, caring or rifle or flying at their point, that's not enough.

1220
01:33:24.80 --> 01:33:26.80
That's not what you're doing.

1221
01:33:26.80 --> 01:33:32.80
And that seemingly insignificant little micro task of one of hundreds of thousands of Marines.

1222
01:33:32.80 --> 01:33:36.80
Just the squad leader. The squad leader is a corporal.

1223
01:33:36.80 --> 01:33:41.80
It's a corporal rifleman with a couple other corporals working for him.

1224
01:33:41.80 --> 01:33:44.80
I mean, on paper, it seems so small and so insignificant.

1225
01:33:44.80 --> 01:33:51.80
But it's not it's huge. And as a leader, do you want people at that level of organization thinking the entire weight of the organization,

1226
01:33:51.80 --> 01:33:53.80
rest in their shoulders?

1227
01:33:53.80 --> 01:33:56.80
Yes, because that's what guides them to make those decisions.

1228
01:33:56.80 --> 01:33:57.80
You don't have to do it.

1229
01:33:57.80 --> 01:33:59.80
It's there's so much in there, man.

1230
01:33:59.80 --> 01:34:03.80
And it echoes so many of the things that you talk about.

1231
01:34:03.80 --> 01:34:07.80
And it's just a very slight variation of this competition with other other armies.

1232
01:34:07.80 --> 01:34:10.80
But it's all the same thing as a leader.

1233
01:34:10.80 --> 01:34:12.80
It's the exact same thing.

1234
01:34:12.80 --> 01:34:16.80
And that's why I started off in the opening of this podcast.

1235
01:34:16.80 --> 01:34:21.80
But I say, if you know the way broadly, you see it and all things.

1236
01:34:21.80 --> 01:34:32.80
The nature of these campaigns will require Marines to get comfortable asking for authorities to use tools in new domains like cyber or support to public diplomacy.

1237
01:34:32.80 --> 01:34:37.80
These campaigns combine cooperation and competition with other

1238
01:34:37.80 --> 01:34:46.80
and so we have to be able to work in all those domains.

1239
01:34:46.80 --> 01:34:55.80
Diplomatic information, military, and economic.

1240
01:34:55.80 --> 01:34:58.80
So we have to be able to work in all those domains.

1241
01:34:58.80 --> 01:35:02.80
Diplomatic information, military.

1242
01:35:02.80 --> 01:35:04.80
That's the obvious one in the economic.

1243
01:35:04.80 --> 01:35:09.80
We're playing a role in all those things.

1244
01:35:09.80 --> 01:35:11.80
The evolution of competition.

1245
01:35:11.80 --> 01:35:13.80
Next section.

1246
01:35:13.80 --> 01:35:15.80
International competition is never static.

1247
01:35:15.80 --> 01:35:17.80
It constantly evolves.

1248
01:35:17.80 --> 01:35:29.80
In fact, it is co-evolutionary because as one actor develops a competitive tool, other actors adapt to it by trying to either counter it or develop another tool that displaces it.

1249
01:35:29.80 --> 01:35:36.80
This co-evolution is seen clearly when technology changes.

1250
01:35:36.80 --> 01:35:39.80
And once again, guess what they use here for an example?

1251
01:35:39.80 --> 01:35:41.80
Do they use a military battle?

1252
01:35:41.80 --> 01:35:43.80
Do they use that?

1253
01:35:43.80 --> 01:35:44.80
They use Henry Ford.

1254
01:35:44.80 --> 01:35:47.80
Henry Ford's invention of the assembly line,

1255
01:35:47.80 --> 01:35:51.80
caused dramatic efforts to adapt among other automakers.

1256
01:35:51.80 --> 01:35:58.80
In today's world firms increasingly try to automate their assembly lines and never to stay ahead in the competitive marketplace.

1257
01:35:58.80 --> 01:36:09.80
And much the same way, the choice is political actors make in developing new concepts and technology to support them are competitive acts.

1258
01:36:09.80 --> 01:36:15.80
They develop them because they seek an advantage over a particular rival or rivals.

1259
01:36:15.80 --> 01:36:18.80
So look, the battlefield changes all the time.

1260
01:36:18.80 --> 01:36:19.80
The market changes all the time.

1261
01:36:19.80 --> 01:36:21.80
Your competitors are doing things to adapt to that.

1262
01:36:21.80 --> 01:36:24.80
You have to do things to adapt to what their adaptations are.

1263
01:36:24.80 --> 01:36:25.80
This is what it's like.

1264
01:36:25.80 --> 01:36:30.80
Never static. Never static.

1265
01:36:30.80 --> 01:36:36.80
I used to tell the young seals out in the field during training exercises.

1266
01:36:36.80 --> 01:36:42.80
Would big fire fight would break out with paintball and all of a sudden it would go quiet.

1267
01:36:42.80 --> 01:36:46.80
And the tendency was, oh cool, they're not shooting at us. We can rest.

1268
01:36:46.80 --> 01:36:52.80
And I'd go over and whisper in the leaders ear and I'd say, hey,

1269
01:36:52.80 --> 01:36:57.80
when you're not getting shot at, it means the enemy is maneuvering on you.

1270
01:36:57.80 --> 01:37:03.80
Never static. What can you do? How can you improve your position right now?

1271
01:37:03.80 --> 01:37:11.80
The speed of this evolution usually rests on the rate of technological change because new technologies create opportunities to develop concepts, new concepts,

1272
01:37:11.80 --> 01:37:15.80
or new concepts may stimulate the development of new technology.

1273
01:37:15.80 --> 01:37:25.80
In some cases, though, new concepts emerge when mature technologies are combined with new organizations and new operating methods.

1274
01:37:25.80 --> 01:37:31.80
As military's wrestle with the questions of how to build and keep an edge over their potential opponents,

1275
01:37:31.80 --> 01:37:38.80
they juggle factors like switching costs, which is how much money and effort does it take to make a change.

1276
01:37:38.80 --> 01:37:40.80
It's a good term.

1277
01:37:40.80 --> 01:37:45.80
Switching costs, so how much money is going to take us to make a change and how much effort is going to take?

1278
01:37:45.80 --> 01:37:51.80
That's a switching cost. The cost curve will, I spend more or less than my opponent.

1279
01:37:51.80 --> 01:37:56.80
How long can I sustain this level of spending? The level of spending that this change requires.

1280
01:37:56.80 --> 01:38:02.80
That's a cost curve. And then opportunity cost, which I think most people know, if I put, and this is Marine Corps explaining it,

1281
01:38:02.80 --> 01:38:06.80
if I put effort into this change, then I will not be able to do something else instead.

1282
01:38:06.80 --> 01:38:15.80
So we always have to weigh the opportunity cost. If I focus on this thing over here, that means I'm not focusing on something over here. What's that going to mean?

1283
01:38:15.80 --> 01:38:21.80
Marines know that in combat, sometimes we fight to gain information about the enemy.

1284
01:38:21.80 --> 01:38:32.80
Once we obtain this information, we then inject into, we then inject it into our plan so that we can increase the effectiveness of our operation.

1285
01:38:32.80 --> 01:38:36.80
So we're constantly out trying to figure out what the enemy is doing, trying to gain information on them.

1286
01:38:36.80 --> 01:38:41.80
Once we gain information, we inject it into our plans so we can be more effective.

1287
01:38:41.80 --> 01:38:53.80
The same dynamic exists in competition. Clearly, we gain information as we compete with a rival and must use this to our advantage.

1288
01:38:53.80 --> 01:38:56.80
Here's what I think we got to remember about this.

1289
01:38:56.80 --> 01:39:06.80
Sometimes we're gaining information. Well, oftentimes a great way to gain information is to proactively probe for it.

1290
01:39:06.80 --> 01:39:11.80
You know what's what's what's echo's based like, I'll try a little sweep. Oh, I've got some good bass.

1291
01:39:11.80 --> 01:39:13.80
All but he exposes his arms sometimes.

1292
01:39:13.80 --> 01:39:17.80
That's good to know. Little information about. I tried a little something to go, I'll go burn some information.

1293
01:39:17.80 --> 01:39:22.80
We're constantly doing that.

1294
01:39:22.80 --> 01:39:38.80
We're fighting teaches that that's the book we're fighting teaches that we should try to get inside the enemy's thought processes and see the enemy as they see themselves.

1295
01:39:38.80 --> 01:39:47.80
That's why that's why Colonel David Hackworth had his troopers read.

1296
01:39:47.80 --> 01:39:53.80
Mao said, Tom, to figure out what they were thinking, how they're going to fight this war. He explained,

1297
01:39:53.80 --> 01:40:02.80
Mao explains how to fight the guerrilla war. Why would you not be studying that? Why would you not be trying to get inside the enemy's head?

1298
01:40:02.80 --> 01:40:09.80
This holds equally for getting inside our competitors thought processes.

1299
01:40:09.80 --> 01:40:15.80
So we should be doing the same thing. I'm not just about war. What are you thinking?

1300
01:40:15.80 --> 01:40:24.80
And this goes back to that one. I've been funny how everything ties together because of a deral and I did an unraveling podcast.

1301
01:40:24.80 --> 01:40:34.80
And the title of podcast is what's your story? And just about how we create stories in our heads.

1302
01:40:34.80 --> 01:40:39.80
And they're very malleable. You can be very easily influenced.

1303
01:40:39.80 --> 01:40:47.80
And you go through it's almost like a survival mechanism to create a story inside your head so that you can comprehend the world.

1304
01:40:47.80 --> 01:40:55.80
And we do that. There's all kinds of psychological experiments that we talk about on that, on that particular podcast, that proves that you'll just kind of make things up.

1305
01:40:55.80 --> 01:41:00.80
Like if there's not a good explanation, you just be like, well, hey, that's what happened. And you'll believe it.

1306
01:41:00.80 --> 01:41:03.80
And so we're doing that all the time.

1307
01:41:03.80 --> 01:41:09.80
We're doing that. We're telling ourselves little stories. So it's important. And I've been saying this on EF online as well.

1308
01:41:09.80 --> 01:41:14.80
It's one thing for me to try and understand Dave's perspective.

1309
01:41:14.80 --> 01:41:23.80
Well, you know, Dave's in that division over here. And Dave got this as a priority. So his perspective must be this. That's great. That's a great thing to do.

1310
01:41:23.80 --> 01:41:31.80
Please understand people's perspective. Let's go deeper though. What I really want to do is I want to know what's Dave's story.

1311
01:41:31.80 --> 01:41:38.80
What? Where is he come from? What's his background? How long has he been here? Who's he working for? Who's he got on his team?

1312
01:41:38.80 --> 01:41:45.80
What's his family doing? What's his family situation? What's his financial situation? Where is he at?

1313
01:41:45.80 --> 01:41:48.80
What is his story?

1314
01:41:48.80 --> 01:41:55.80
You ever, you ever, like you're with your buddy. And you know, echoing on your hanging out and then Dave comes over and Echo's never met Echo before.

1315
01:41:55.80 --> 01:42:00.80
Hey, Dave, what's up? How's it going? Boom. And then Dave leaves. And Echo is what's that guy's story?

1316
01:42:00.80 --> 01:42:11.80
You see what I'm saying? Yeah, we want to know what people's stories are. And if we can understand what someone's story is, then we can better predict what they're going to do.

1317
01:42:11.80 --> 01:42:16.80
Not just their perspective, look, their perspective will be part of the story. You can understand their story. You understand their perspective.

1318
01:42:16.80 --> 01:42:25.80
Now I can do a much better job of predicting not with 100% accuracy, but with more accuracy. So I can make a better guess.

1319
01:42:25.80 --> 01:42:35.80
Better anticipation of what their move is going to be. So we are always trying to get inside our competitors' thought process.

1320
01:42:35.80 --> 01:42:43.80
Trying to know what their story is. Powerful tool.

1321
01:42:43.80 --> 01:42:47.80
And then we get into this conclusion.

1322
01:42:47.80 --> 01:43:01.80
The competition is the normal state of the relationship between political actors and international relations. Right? And obviously it's not just that it's between human beings.

1323
01:43:01.80 --> 01:43:09.80
There's competition happening. Echo, you were talking about that thing. You're like, when I see someone kind of size them up.

1324
01:43:09.80 --> 01:43:22.80
Like you've talked about this in Jiu Jitsu, where you say, basically if someone that's an equivalent kind of height, weight, age scenario as you, what's your thoughts? You're sizing them up, right?

1325
01:43:22.80 --> 01:43:31.80
There's competition, but we don't even know this person. This person may not even train. They might not even care, but you're looking at him like you're in the game.

1326
01:43:31.80 --> 01:43:50.80
You said that real like, impassing they might not even care. My hypothesis is that they do care. In one way or another, a physical situational evaluation takes place when you meet someone within that realm or whatever.

1327
01:43:50.80 --> 01:44:01.80
You're not to say you want to be a mom, not to say you want to fight with them, not to say you want to whatever. I'm just saying that evaluation process is a real thing. And it happens. I think most of the time.

1328
01:44:01.80 --> 01:44:14.80
Again, if a guy is so far out of the scope of like you're, we'll see your orbit, right? We will call it for lack of a term like your age or size. If it's a good situation, whatever.

1329
01:44:14.80 --> 01:44:32.80
But yeah, it kind of doesn't happen that much, but yes, I still believe that. Dave, when you were in the United States Marine Corps, and you met someone that was also a fighter pilot.

1330
01:44:32.80 --> 01:44:36.80
What's the thought process saying? I mean, don't worry, Matt.

1331
01:44:36.80 --> 01:44:46.80
Hey, how can you, what's the, what's the pecking order if we haven't got to dogfight against each other? How does that work?

1332
01:44:46.80 --> 01:44:56.80
I mean, you know, at the most basic level, it's what's that guy fly? You know, and you can in your mind and we'll wait, meaning, oh, is this guy fly in F-18?

1333
01:44:56.80 --> 01:45:15.80
I'm not defending this train of thought, but you will draw some conclusions in your mind and backtrack. You'll create his story for him in your own head. Oh, jocca flies this. Okay, well, this happened this happened this happened this happened and you'll trace it back to him when he's five and got him on the figure out.

1334
01:45:15.80 --> 01:45:30.80
Because you're sizing them up a little bit and you'll create and the more similar the scenario is the more I guess the more friction could be there in your mind. I'm like, oh, this guy interesting. Okay, this could be this could be a thing.

1335
01:45:30.80 --> 01:45:39.80
We might, you know, we will have to figure this out, you know, up in the air. So just the way you described it. I mean, it's it's very similar.

1336
01:45:39.80 --> 01:45:52.80
You figured out in the air. I mean, that's the easiest way to do it. Can you, I mean, is it like, because one thing that's great about you just say, oh, I'm sizing this guy up. Yeah, hey, you want to roll, where about to find out, where about to find out.

1337
01:45:52.80 --> 01:46:01.80
Yeah, can you do that? You can, but you can see it. You can see how does this guy brief? How does this guy get along when he first shows up at a squadron? How does he do other types of flying?

1338
01:46:01.80 --> 01:46:15.80
There's a bunch of different ways. It doesn't just have to be you and one other person in a dogfight, but especially a top-end what's cool is you get to do that a lot. And that's probably the most fun way to just, I don't know what to say, settle it.

1339
01:46:15.80 --> 01:46:34.80
You know, that sounds pretty crazy, but you, you can create, you can resolve a lot of things by doing that. We'll say it helps establish a higher hierarchy. It absolutely does. And, and if that's, if that's all you go on, then you're going to create problems by doing that. But there's a hierarchy. There is a hierarchy in there.

1340
01:46:34.80 --> 01:46:47.80
And it is always better to be towards a top of that hierarchy. That's a better place to be than at the bottom of it. How often is a guy of freaking awesome pilot and just a turd leader?

1341
01:46:47.80 --> 01:47:00.80
Not very often. Most of the time. It can happen. It can happen. It can't. Usually there's a correlation. And as a matter of fact, you know, I'd rather have a guy who's, who's, who's awesome leaders, a great person to be around a great teacher.

1342
01:47:00.80 --> 01:47:11.80
And it's kind of a top third than a dude who's, you know, just really good at flying an airplane and he sucks it, everything else. And so, you know, a hierarchy is not just who won in that particular fight. There's a whole bunch of things.

1343
01:47:11.80 --> 01:47:16.80
But it's, I think it's the same. Very similar. Yeah, and the higher, the hierarchy is not just that.

1344
01:47:16.80 --> 01:47:18.80
But let's face it.

1345
01:47:18.80 --> 01:47:31.80
Yeah, I mean, the culture, the hierarchy of the culture is kind of like people understand it even though it might not be able to be like 100% tangible. You know, you kind of like introduce them. Sure. It's like that as well in flying and all other activities.

1346
01:47:31.80 --> 01:47:36.80
I always like telling these stories though, because I know Jocca's over there thinking, I don't like to rely on machines.

1347
01:47:36.80 --> 01:47:40.80
And he's the whole thing like whatever that's on machine. Don't care.

1348
01:47:40.80 --> 01:47:43.80
Oh, you're machine can be my machine.

1349
01:47:43.80 --> 01:48:09.80
Cool. Well, the other thing that's also from a leadership perspective is you got to recognize that inside your team when you got 12 people working for you. There's competition going on between those two people and the little subtle, the little subtle preferences or statements or comments that you make impact that competition and can create animosity where you should be as a leader trying to unify your team.

1350
01:48:09.80 --> 01:48:17.80
So, so pay attention to that competition. Look and and then there's times where we want to seed and fuel competition. Right. Oh, yeah.

1351
01:48:17.80 --> 01:48:26.80
Echo versus hey, who's a better shot? You or you or Dave and it's all I'm better. Okay. Let's see. And now we're creating some stress so that we get better training. It's great. So we want to fuel that.

1352
01:48:26.80 --> 01:48:35.80
But we don't want to have a negative impact. We don't want to take away from the team by fueling competition competition just like anything else. Guess what? There's a dichotomy.

1353
01:48:35.80 --> 01:48:42.80
And go to far with competition. Now we got the team attacking each other. But if we don't have any competition now the team's not staying sharp. Yeah.

1354
01:48:42.80 --> 01:48:49.80
And we see this all the time. I mean, I think in my mind, like the simplest example is when we work with companies and we talk about their sales departments.

1355
01:48:49.80 --> 01:48:57.80
There's there's absolute competition among sales and do we want that? Yeah. Absolutely. I want sales teams pushing each other.

1356
01:48:57.80 --> 01:49:07.80
And so the connection from this this publication about competing the recognition like you said that exists everywhere and what a good leader does is actually harness that.

1357
01:49:07.80 --> 01:49:12.80
So everybody benefits and wins from that is critical. And if you don't think that's going on has a leader.

1358
01:49:12.80 --> 01:49:20.80
If you're like, oh, no, no, no, we're all just harmonious. We're all just fully aligned in the same page all the time. And there is no competition. You're missing a whole bunch of those dynamics.

1359
01:49:20.80 --> 01:49:38.80
There's a lot of power on that. And if you're not paying attention to it, that can spiral out of control. And you get this you get the friction of the point that people on the same team are actually sabotaging each other. Yeah. Oh, I'm not given Dave my lead. Yeah. I'm not turning this over. I'm not going to give them the back brief on what that clients like I don't want them to get another mark on the board.

1360
01:49:38.80 --> 01:49:52.80
So once again, conclusion competition is the normal state of the relationships between political actors in international relations. It occurs as the interests of these actors come into conflict as they try and advance them in the world.

1361
01:49:52.80 --> 01:50:00.80
Right, everyone's working on their own little gig oftentimes two political actors will compete in one area and cooperate in another.

1362
01:50:00.80 --> 01:50:08.80
Thus, there is a competition continuum that extends from relatively benign efforts to advance interest to the violent efforts that include war.

1363
01:50:08.80 --> 01:50:12.80
War then is a special kind of competition. They just can't get away from that statement.

1364
01:50:12.80 --> 01:50:22.80
One that sets the conditions for the mostly non-violent struggle that always follows the end of armed conflict.

1365
01:50:22.80 --> 01:50:30.80
Like war, and again, this is all just a conclusion. Like war. This is by the way. This is a conclusion of chapter one.

1366
01:50:30.80 --> 01:50:35.80
Like war competition is characterized by ambiguity, uncertainty, fluidity, disorder and complexity.

1367
01:50:35.80 --> 01:50:49.80
Rivals will try to use these attributes to obscure their aims and achieve their advantages over opponents competitors naturally apply creativity and science to develop advantages as well, which causes the form of competition to constantly evolve.

1368
01:50:49.80 --> 01:50:53.80
The history of competition is also a history of change.

1369
01:50:53.80 --> 01:50:59.80
Marine Marines and the Marine Corps have an important but supporting role in the nation's competitions.

1370
01:50:59.80 --> 01:51:07.80
The activities of Marines take place all along the continuum, including on both sides of the violence threshold.

1371
01:51:07.80 --> 01:51:14.80
The competition continuum is therefore something Marines must understand.

1372
01:51:14.80 --> 01:51:28.80
If you take that idea of this continuum and you also then overlay the idea of leading and the idea of influence, there's also a continuum.

1373
01:51:28.80 --> 01:51:32.80
I sort of talk about it. The escalation of counseling. It's a very similar thing.

1374
01:51:32.80 --> 01:51:38.80
The escalation of counseling is how much influence. What are you doing to influence? How are you doing this? How are you making this happen?

1375
01:51:38.80 --> 01:51:56.80
The point you've crossed the threshold from indirect to direct, minimizing the amount of time that you spend on the direct influence, the coercion, the forcefulness. That's not what we're looking to do.

1376
01:51:56.80 --> 01:51:59.80
Very important stuff to think about.

1377
01:51:59.80 --> 01:52:12.80
I figured we can make it through two chapters, but I don't want to jump into the next chapter because we'll be in here for another three hours.

1378
01:52:12.80 --> 01:52:24.80
So with that, we will pick up the rest of this. I guess on the next one.

1379
01:52:24.80 --> 01:52:34.80
I got asked a question the other day is on a F online. The question was basically, how do I train the leadership principles?

1380
01:52:34.80 --> 01:52:43.80
How do I train those leadership principles? How do I get better at these leadership principles? If I'm working all the time in a leadership position, in other words, I'm leading.

1381
01:52:43.80 --> 01:52:56.80
How do I have time to train? How do I have time to get better? I answered the question. I said, listen, here's the answer.

1382
01:52:56.80 --> 01:53:04.80
I'm not going to get it exact, but there's two components to it. One of them is being intentional about what you're going to do.

1383
01:53:04.80 --> 01:53:13.80
Paying attention and intention. Those are the two words I use. Paying attention and then having intention. You need to pay attention to what's going on around you.

1384
01:53:13.80 --> 01:53:22.80
Because there's no better way to train leadership than leading, but it only works if you pay attention to it.

1385
01:53:22.80 --> 01:53:35.80
You're going to get the intention part. You're going to cancel someone. You're going to meet with your supervisor or you're going to meet with a subordinate.

1386
01:53:35.80 --> 01:53:49.80
Take three minutes before three minutes. Hey, I know what I'll press for time. You can take three minutes. Take three minutes and figure out what is your intention from a leadership perspective going into this meeting.

1387
01:53:49.80 --> 01:54:05.80
What are you going to do in this meeting? Hey, I'm going to meet with Dave and it's a subject that we disagree on Dave wants to meet with me about this. This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to detach. I'm going to listen. I'm going to find some common ground.

1388
01:54:05.80 --> 01:54:23.80
I'm going to ask for some time to think about his perspective. That's what I'm going to do. Right that down. Take three minutes. Three minutes to figure out what a good course of action is. Then you go. Then you go to the meeting. So that's your training. Your initial part of the training is intention. What do you intend to do.

1389
01:54:23.80 --> 01:54:35.80
Then you go to the meeting. That's the intention part. Now how do you now you got to pay attention to how you actually did you got to detach a little bit when you get done with the meeting. How did you do?

1390
01:54:35.80 --> 01:54:45.80
Did you get emotional? Did you talk more than you listened, which by the way to me, if I have a meeting where I talk more than I listen, it's probably was a bad meeting.

1391
01:54:45.80 --> 01:54:55.80
Then I lose my temper. Did I tell Dave there's no way we're doing it your way. Is that where I went? And you got to be honest with yourself.

1392
01:54:55.80 --> 01:55:14.80
And then you got to make adjustments. That's how you're going to improve. And that's why one of the reasons that I'm saying this is that these manuals they can be so helpful to us and for us because we they can they can tell us what it is we should be doing.

1393
01:55:14.80 --> 01:55:30.80
So we can actually do it. And this is a subject I talked about on the F online today. I heard this interview with Gary Kasparov who's a 20 year chess champion and he was talking about chess and he got asked about Magnus Carlson who's this young.

1394
01:55:30.80 --> 01:55:57.80
Well, he was 19 when he won the World Champion became the best in the world and total dominant prodigy in the game and and the guy basically said, you know, well, who kind of who's better and you didn't come right out and say it, but it was implied and and Gary Kasparov understood the implication and there was a couple things that he said one one thing that he said that was interesting he said basically said I'm too old the compete.

1395
01:55:57.80 --> 01:56:02.80
And it's interesting because you think about maybe in your jitz or you can get to a little bit of chess you should get better.

1396
01:56:02.80 --> 01:56:15.80
But he talked about the physical fitness aspect of even playing chess and how sharp your mind is and that tied into how sharp your body is and if you're younger you have an advantage which was very I didn't expect that at all.

1397
01:56:15.80 --> 01:56:17.80
But more important.

1398
01:56:17.80 --> 01:56:20.80
He said that Magnus.

1399
01:56:20.80 --> 01:56:29.80
Even though he's been playing chess for much shorter time he's only 30 years old and Kasparov is 57 he's been playing chess for way less time.

1400
01:56:29.80 --> 01:56:45.80
But Magnus has been able to learn everything that Kasparov has done throughout his whole career because they take when when a chess game happens they document every single move and they they put it in a book and you can read that book and you can know exactly what the move was what the outcome was.

1401
01:56:45.80 --> 01:56:50.80
And so Magnus got to study those.

1402
01:56:50.80 --> 01:56:58.80
He got to study those things he got lifted up on the shoulders of Kasparov so how could how could Kasparov compete.

1403
01:56:58.80 --> 01:57:05.80
Because it wasn't that Magnus just didn't just get to study Kasparov you got to study all the all the masters of all time.

1404
01:57:05.80 --> 01:57:10.80
And Kasparov who dominated for twenty freaking straight years.

1405
01:57:10.80 --> 01:57:18.80
And I was talking about this with you Dave the other day I'm like hey Dave I'm reading a book right now and this guy's giving information.

1406
01:57:18.80 --> 01:57:26.80
About leadership the and this is he's given information about leadership that I thought I kind of figured out from and I had to figure out for myself.

1407
01:57:26.80 --> 01:57:34.80
And he's giving information and the book was published in 1973 and I never got to stand on the shoulders of that giant to learn that lesson.

1408
01:57:34.80 --> 01:57:37.80
Why because I didn't approach it with the right attitude.

1409
01:57:37.80 --> 01:57:50.80
So these books these documents whether historical documents whether it's a first person account of what happened in battle and what that leader did we have to understand.

1410
01:57:50.80 --> 01:58:03.80
That we can take those things and we can learn from them we can literally take moves just like moves on the chessboard and we can be a better leader because we understand how things occurred in the past.

1411
01:58:03.80 --> 01:58:18.80
We get to study leadership we get to study human nature we get to study interactions between people when they fight when they go to war when they lead when the influence when they compete.

1412
01:58:18.80 --> 01:58:21.80
And that.

1413
01:58:21.80 --> 01:58:37.80
Paying attention and having intention and recognizing that everything you see is an opportunity for you to learn and take and put that in your playbook and make you better.

1414
01:58:37.80 --> 01:58:53.80
And we miss that opportunity all the time because we're not paying attention and we don't have the right intention.

1415
01:58:53.80 --> 01:59:09.80
I mean, there's so there's so much there and I think my favorite part about even just this first chapter because I had a tiny suspicion like we're never going to get through this.

1416
01:59:09.80 --> 01:59:26.80
How easy it was to connect all those comments all the things they're saying to so many other areas so many other places in life and you started and that saying when you when you when you know the way broadly you see it and all things.

1417
01:59:26.80 --> 01:59:38.80
As as much as that as much as you say that it's it's so true it's such an important.

1418
01:59:38.80 --> 01:59:42.80
So just hearing that and and and you come out of the gate and in three minutes you're talking about parenting and kids and family on a on a manual about.

1419
01:59:42.80 --> 01:59:52.80
You know total competition between nation states and inside that is all these these these these pieces of leadership of of human nature and.

1420
01:59:52.80 --> 02:00:09.80
And then I think I look back on my 40 coming to put 40 something 49 years like man how much have I missed how many opportunities have been out there and not see these things in other places.

1421
02:00:09.80 --> 02:00:11.80
So there's so much in there.

1422
02:00:11.80 --> 02:00:23.80
Chapter one. Making us better echo channels speaking of getting better what suggestions do you have for us.

1423
02:00:23.80 --> 02:00:25.80
Well.

1424
02:00:25.80 --> 02:00:37.80
To be honest that you covered it or a big part of it I say I had to be honest with you, but sure I can add maybe hopefully I can add a little.

1425
02:00:37.80 --> 02:00:43.80
Little something you did mention physical fitness in chess which was interesting.

1426
02:00:43.80 --> 02:00:55.80
That is interesting you burn three X the number of calories you would normally burn burn in a day so if you did a day just normal activity.

1427
02:00:55.80 --> 02:01:05.80
Or you did a chest tournament chest tournament three X the number of calories. Heart rate goes up breathing goes up.

1428
02:01:05.80 --> 02:01:07.80
Tense muscles.

1429
02:01:07.80 --> 02:01:07.80
Yeah.

1430
02:01:07.80 --> 02:01:09.80
I wonder why I wonder why.

1431
02:01:09.80 --> 02:01:12.80
I got like just the stress of the company stress of the company.

1432
02:01:12.80 --> 02:01:13.80
Yeah.

1433
02:01:13.80 --> 02:01:13.80
Yeah.

1434
02:01:13.80 --> 02:01:13.80
Yeah.

1435
02:01:13.80 --> 02:01:18.80
I was wondering how much of which is brain power getting used I don't know the answer to that.

1436
02:01:18.80 --> 02:01:25.80
You know, you mentioned muscles. Tense it up but but. Okay. Yeah.

1437
02:01:25.80 --> 02:01:26.80
Okay.

1438
02:01:26.80 --> 02:01:27.80
But.

1439
02:01:27.80 --> 02:01:28.80
You know, okay.

1440
02:01:28.80 --> 02:01:37.80
We really can't just throw out that that's the significant you know like all right we'll go do a metcon for how long is the chest match you'd say I don't know tournament.

1441
02:01:37.80 --> 02:01:39.80
Depends what type of to chest match it is.

1442
02:01:39.80 --> 02:01:40.80
Yeah.

1443
02:01:40.80 --> 02:01:41.80
For types.

1444
02:01:41.80 --> 02:01:43.80
So if you get okay there's what let's chest.

1445
02:01:43.80 --> 02:01:44.80
Yeah.

1446
02:01:44.80 --> 02:01:49.80
There's just some kind of timed chest and then there's speed chest. Yeah. I don't know if it's called speed chest. Yeah.

1447
02:01:49.80 --> 02:01:50.80
Okay.

1448
02:01:50.80 --> 02:01:56.80
All right. Well let's think scientifically then. Okay. You got one booth. I don't know.

1449
02:01:56.80 --> 02:01:58.80
Both of two guys playing chess.

1450
02:01:58.80 --> 02:02:05.80
This is going to last two hours. You got another booth that I do in every day run of the meal metcon for two hours.

1451
02:02:05.80 --> 02:02:07.80
Well, the metcon guys obviously burn in a lot.

1452
02:02:07.80 --> 02:02:11.80
The metcon guys going to burn all literally all his calories before the chat you know that.

1453
02:02:11.80 --> 02:02:16.80
So I'm just saying the muscle tense thing may not be it that as much of a thing we'll say.

1454
02:02:16.80 --> 02:02:16.80
Okay.

1455
02:02:16.80 --> 02:02:17.80
All right. Speaking of.

1456
02:02:17.80 --> 02:02:22.80
If you've got a recommending chest as your new physical workout it's not what I'm doing here.

1457
02:02:22.80 --> 02:02:22.80
Okay.

1458
02:02:22.80 --> 02:02:25.80
There. Yeah. That that seems it seems correct for sure.

1459
02:02:25.80 --> 02:02:36.80
Nonetheless as far as fitness goes look it's not to say that chest is like not a way to get better because it's straight up is.

1460
02:02:36.80 --> 02:02:43.80
But as far as physical fitness goes maybe not but not fitness not the best avenue. Yeah.

1461
02:02:43.80 --> 02:02:47.80
Many other avenues due to that's one of them.

1462
02:02:47.80 --> 02:02:54.80
Just general workouts right workouts you can this all kinds of workouts whatever unless you do have to work out.

1463
02:02:54.80 --> 02:02:56.80
I think I concur.

1464
02:02:56.80 --> 02:02:57.80
Deeper.

1465
02:02:57.80 --> 02:03:02.80
Same concur. All right. Well we're working out everyone's a mile.

1466
02:03:02.80 --> 02:03:09.80
We might have issues that we that concern us joint issues or back issues depending on who you are.

1467
02:03:09.80 --> 02:03:16.80
Uh, a shoulder is elbow issues as the case may or may not be but we don't want to worry about this kind of issues.

1468
02:03:16.80 --> 02:03:22.80
So we got some supplementation for for a lot of stuff really but it as far as joint and stuff we've had joint warfare.

1469
02:03:22.80 --> 02:03:24.80
We got super cruel oil.

1470
02:03:24.80 --> 02:03:27.80
We also have vitamin D for immune.

1471
02:03:27.80 --> 02:03:31.80
I don't even want to say issues. I want to say your whole immune situation really.

1472
02:03:31.80 --> 02:03:34.80
To prevent issues.

1473
02:03:34.80 --> 02:03:35.80
Check this out.

1474
02:03:35.80 --> 02:03:38.80
Here's yeah. I got to uh uh wait.

1475
02:03:38.80 --> 02:03:41.80
I got to some good news for everybody.

1476
02:03:41.80 --> 02:03:43.80
We'll look. There's plenty of bad news out there in the world right now.

1477
02:03:43.80 --> 02:03:46.80
I just have right. I got some good news for everybody. Here's a good news.

1478
02:03:46.80 --> 02:03:50.80
All these different type of supplements that you're talking about.

1479
02:03:50.80 --> 02:03:55.80
Things that I take every single day joint warfare I take every single day.

1480
02:03:55.80 --> 02:04:00.80
They grow, take every single day, discipline take every single day, vitamin D three take every single day.

1481
02:04:00.80 --> 02:04:03.80

Mulk.

1484
02:04:07.80 --> 02:04:11.80
Yes, I can't say I take it every day but I take it six days.

1485
02:04:11.80 --> 02:04:13.80
No five days out of seven.

1486
02:04:13.80 --> 02:04:16.80
Maybe six days out of seven. I have a lot of mulk.

1487
02:04:16.80 --> 02:04:19.80
Any of these items that you want.

1488
02:04:19.80 --> 02:04:24.80

you get a subscription for Kiloil, you will get free shipping.

1492
02:04:37.80 --> 02:04:43.80
Yeah. Look, we, because listen, there's people out there rightfully so that

1493
02:04:43.80 --> 02:04:52.80
don't necessarily want to support some of the companies that sell our products

1494
02:04:52.80 --> 02:04:55.80
for whatever reason.

1495
02:04:55.80 --> 02:04:58.80
But some of those companies have free shipping, which makes it real.

1496
02:04:58.80 --> 02:05:01.80
You know, you can save a lot of money.

1497

02:05:04.80 --> 02:05:11.80
if you want to subscribe to this stuff, any of it.

1499
02:05:11.80 --> 02:05:15.80
If you subscribe to one thing, you'll get free shipping on whatever you order.

1500
02:05:15.80 --> 02:05:18.80
So, some, come, subscribe.

1501
02:05:18.80 --> 02:05:22.80
I'll see you give like 10% off if you subscribe.

1502
02:05:22.80 --> 02:05:27.80
So subscription, what I'm saying is if you want this stuff and you take it all the time,

1503
02:05:27.80 --> 02:05:31.80
like I do, like echo does, they will do you take every day.

1504
02:05:31.80 --> 02:05:34.80
The list is the list.

1505
02:05:34.80 --> 02:05:41.80
I'm probably like, I'm probably maybe maybe four or five mulk's a week.

1506
02:05:41.80 --> 02:05:45.80
I'm, I'm, I'm over the threshold on on discipline go.

1507
02:05:45.80 --> 02:05:49.80
So whatever eight out of seven if that's a math problem.

1508
02:05:49.80 --> 02:05:52.80
And then the only thing I will say is that Cold War

1509
02:05:52.80 --> 02:05:57.80
has kind of moved to the top of my, like I never forget Cold War ever.

1510
02:05:57.80 --> 02:06:01.80
And I'm probably benefit because my subscription, I get it.

1511
02:06:01.80 --> 02:06:03.80
I don't think about it. I don't run out.

1512
02:06:03.80 --> 02:06:07.80
But look, man, lately that's been on, that's, I don't ever miss it, everyone.

1531
02:06:46.80 --> 02:06:47.80
That's not in every story yet.

02:06:47.80 --> 02:06:50.80
But yeah, look, January 4th, they started infusing it.

1533
02:06:50.80 --> 02:06:55.80

So appreciate that support.

1537
02:07:11.80 --> 02:07:14.80
Appreciate that support from wall.

1538
02:07:14.80 --> 02:07:18.80
Yeah, it's a good situation where let's face it.

1539
02:07:18.80 --> 02:07:21.80
Sometimes we don't want to order online.

1540
02:07:21.80 --> 02:07:22.80
Seems crazy.

1541
02:07:22.80 --> 02:07:23.80
Well, sometimes we're driving.

1542
02:07:23.80 --> 02:07:24.80
It's a good place.

1543
02:07:24.80 --> 02:07:25.80
That's what I'm saying.

1544
02:07:25.80 --> 02:07:26.80
We're tired.

1545
02:07:26.80 --> 02:07:31.80
I want my discipline go between right now and when I get home.

1546
02:07:31.80 --> 02:07:32.80
That's what I want to.

1547
02:07:32.80 --> 02:07:33.80
And currently there's none at my house.

1548
02:07:33.80 --> 02:07:35.80
You can't order that.

1549
02:07:35.80 --> 02:07:38.80
Ordering it from origin main.com subscription.

1550
02:07:38.80 --> 02:07:40.80
Not is not going to help you in that particular.

1551
02:07:40.80 --> 02:07:41.80
It doesn't work that way.

1552
02:07:41.80 --> 02:07:42.80
I need a wall walk.

1553
02:07:42.80 --> 02:07:43.80
Yes, sir.

1554
02:07:43.80 --> 02:07:44.80

If that's your preferred method.

1559
02:07:52.80 --> 02:07:54.80
You know, the cans are kind of a thing.

1560
02:07:54.80 --> 02:07:55.80
Let's face it.

1561
02:07:55.80 --> 02:07:57.80
So I'm kind of doing those a lot.

1562
02:07:57.80 --> 02:07:59.80
But discipline go the powder.

1563
02:07:59.80 --> 02:08:01.80
That's a daily for me as well.

1564
02:08:01.80 --> 02:08:03.80
Especially if I'm working out 100% care to you.

1565
02:08:03.80 --> 02:08:04.80
That's the thing.

1566
02:08:04.80 --> 02:08:05.80

Oh, it's woven here.

02:09:04.80 --> 02:09:05.80
Okay.

And then who took all that stuff and put it together into something you can cover your legs with?

02:09:09.80 --> 02:09:10.80
Yeah.

1605
02:09:10.80 --> 02:09:11.80
Go for your legs.

02:09:11.80 --> 02:09:11.80
Yeah.

1607
02:09:11.80 --> 02:09:15.80
Guess where, guess where that happened in America.

1608
02:09:15.80 --> 02:09:16.80
Dig it.

1609
02:09:16.80 --> 02:09:17.80
Yep.

1610

Also, it's support.

02:09:29.80 --> 02:09:30.80
Hmm.

02:09:45.80 --> 02:09:46.80
Working on the name.

1633
02:09:46.80 --> 02:09:48.80
It's like a t-shirt club.

1634
02:09:48.80 --> 02:09:49.80
Oh, no, I got the name.

1635
02:09:49.80 --> 02:09:53.80
Something from a supporter.

1636
02:09:53.80 --> 02:09:57.80
And I think, well, I have a, I have a candidate for the name that I think is good.

1637
02:09:57.80 --> 02:09:58.80
All right, later.

I'll leave it in your, okay.

You tell me your first.

1646
02:10:07.80 --> 02:10:09.80
Jocco layers.

1647
02:10:09.80 --> 02:10:10.80
Okay.

1648
02:10:10.80 --> 02:10:11.80
Don't like it.

1649
02:10:11.80 --> 02:10:12.80
Appreciate it.

1650
02:10:12.80 --> 02:10:13.80
Get it.

1651
02:10:13.80 --> 02:10:14.80
I like it.

1652
02:10:14.80 --> 02:10:15.80
Okay.

1653
02:10:15.80 --> 02:10:16.80
Here's, what about this?

1654
02:10:16.80 --> 02:10:18.80
The shirt locker.

1655
02:10:18.80 --> 02:10:19.80
Oh,

1656
02:10:19.80 --> 02:10:20.80
Bonsol.

1657
02:10:20.80 --> 02:10:21.80
You're good.

1658
02:10:21.80 --> 02:10:22.80
All right.

1659
02:10:22.80 --> 02:10:24.80
So firstly, the jocco shirt locker.

1660
02:10:24.80 --> 02:10:25.80
So now you.

1661
02:10:25.80 --> 02:10:26.80
Yeah.

1662
02:10:26.80 --> 02:10:26.80
Wow.

1663
02:10:26.80 --> 02:10:26.80
Yeah.

1664
02:10:26.80 --> 02:10:26.80
Okay.

1665
02:10:26.80 --> 02:10:27.80
All right.

1666
02:10:27.80 --> 02:10:28.80
I, to be honest, I'll just be back in the next.

1667
02:10:28.80 --> 02:10:29.80
You're good.

1668
02:10:29.80 --> 02:10:30.80
I'm going to be sure.

1669
02:10:30.80 --> 02:10:31.80
All right.

1670
02:10:31.80 --> 02:10:32.80
These are good.

1671
02:10:32.80 --> 02:10:32.80
Fine.

1672
02:10:32.80 --> 02:10:32.80
Sure.

1673
02:10:32.80 --> 02:10:33.80
Locker.

1674
02:10:33.80 --> 02:10:34.80
Okay.

1675
02:10:34.80 --> 02:10:34.80
Approved.

1676
02:10:34.80 --> 02:10:35.80
Straight up.

1677
02:10:35.80 --> 02:10:36.80
Okay.

1678
02:10:36.80 --> 02:10:37.80
Sure.

1679
02:10:37.80 --> 02:10:38.80
Locker.

1680
02:10:38.80 --> 02:10:39.80
Kind of the same deal for shipping.

1681
02:10:39.80 --> 02:10:40.80
You know, subscription.

1682
02:10:40.80 --> 02:10:42.80
You know, it's a different approach really.

1683
02:10:42.80 --> 02:10:44.80
It's not so you don't run out of shirts.

1684
02:10:44.80 --> 02:10:45.80
It's not that.

1685
02:10:45.80 --> 02:10:47.80
It's just, you know, it's a, it's a t-shirt locker.

1686
02:10:47.80 --> 02:10:48.80
Anyway, check that out.

1687
02:10:48.80 --> 02:10:49.80
It's cool.

1688
02:10:49.80 --> 02:10:53.80
A little bit different designs for us that are, you know, in the game.

1689
02:10:53.80 --> 02:10:54.80
Nonetheless, joccostore.com.

1690

1694
02:11:04.80 --> 02:11:09.80
We have an alternative podcast.

1695
02:11:09.80 --> 02:11:16.80
It's, it's a podcast with amplifying information to, to this podcast.

1696
02:11:16.80 --> 02:11:23.80
Sort of some behind the scenes stuff, some, some Q&A stuff, some, some things that

1697
02:11:23.80 --> 02:11:26.80
didn't quite fit the mold of jocco-pockets.

1698
02:11:26.80 --> 02:11:28.80
This is the face that I didn't want the jocco-pockets to stay.

1699
02:11:28.80 --> 02:11:29.80
What it is.

1700
02:11:29.80 --> 02:11:30.80
Yeah.

1701
02:11:30.80 --> 02:11:31.80
Someone puts in their headphones.

1702
02:11:31.80 --> 02:11:33.80
I want them to get what they expect.

1703
02:11:33.80 --> 02:11:36.80
I want to deliver that product.

1704
02:11:36.80 --> 02:11:38.80
That information.

1705
02:11:38.80 --> 02:11:42.80
So, however, our, and creativity.

1706
02:11:42.80 --> 02:11:44.80
What are we learning from the Marine Corps?

1707
02:11:44.80 --> 02:11:45.80
You can't just keep doing the same thing.

1708
02:11:45.80 --> 02:11:48.80
So, I like to get a little bit artistic and creative.

1709
02:11:48.80 --> 02:11:51.80
You want to do some different things.

1710
02:11:51.80 --> 02:11:54.80
So, now we have a way to do that.

1711
02:11:54.80 --> 02:11:57.80
It's jocco-underground.com.

1712
02:11:57.80 --> 02:12:00.80

shift things happening right now.

1714
02:12:02.80 --> 02:12:06.80
We want to at least be ready in case something crazy happens.

1715
02:12:06.80 --> 02:12:09.80
We also don't want to take on sponsors, because we don't want to start off

1716
02:12:09.80 --> 02:12:12.80
every podcast by saying, welcome to jocco podcast.

1717
02:12:12.80 --> 02:12:14.80
This podcast is brought to me.

1718
02:12:14.80 --> 02:12:15.80
Why?

1719
02:12:15.80 --> 02:12:16.80
I don't want to do that.

1720
02:12:16.80 --> 02:12:19.80
And I also don't want to, in the middle of the podcast,

1721
02:12:19.80 --> 02:12:23.80
talking about the Korean War and some firefighting.

1722
02:12:23.80 --> 02:12:27.80
Be like, and this podcast was put, no, we're not doing that.

1723
02:12:27.80 --> 02:12:32.80
So, if you want to help out, if you want to join the jocco-underground.jocco-underground.com.

1725
02:12:33.80 --> 02:12:37.80
Cost $8.18 a month, which is a number that has layers.

1726
02:12:37.80 --> 02:12:38.80
Layers, right?

1727
02:12:38.80 --> 02:12:40.80
I didn't even know how many layers that number has.

1728
02:12:40.80 --> 02:12:41.80
There's so many layers.

1729
02:12:41.80 --> 02:12:42.80
There's so many layers.

1730
02:12:42.80 --> 02:12:44.80
We're getting layers on layers.

1731
02:12:44.80 --> 02:12:46.80
So, if you want to, if you want to support,

1732
02:12:46.80 --> 02:12:48.80
that's one way to do it.

1733
02:12:48.80 --> 02:12:51.80
That way, we make sure we can keep this podcast up and running

1734
02:12:51.80 --> 02:12:52.80
no matter what happens.

1735
02:12:52.80 --> 02:12:56.80
If you, if you can't afford that, if you're tied on money,

1736
02:12:56.80 --> 02:12:57.80
that's okay.

1737
02:12:57.80 --> 02:13:03.80
We still want to have you in the game with us email assistance

1738
02:13:03.80 --> 02:13:05.80

1739
02:13:05.80 --> 02:13:08.80
And we'll have you taken care of.

1740
02:13:08.80 --> 02:13:10.80
But if you can afford to support, that's awesome too.

1741
02:13:10.80 --> 02:13:12.80
$8.18 a month.

1742
02:13:12.80 --> 02:13:15.80
Also, we have the jocco unraveling podcast,

1743
02:13:15.80 --> 02:13:17.80
which is me and Darryl Cooper.

1744
02:13:17.80 --> 02:13:20.80
I've got the grounded and the warrior kid podcast,

1745
02:13:20.80 --> 02:13:23.80
which I am severely delinquent on.

1746
02:13:23.80 --> 02:13:25.80
It's lingering in the wind.

1747
02:13:25.80 --> 02:13:28.80
My daughter, my youngest daughter today,

1748
02:13:28.80 --> 02:13:31.80
was harassing me about the warrior kid podcast.

1749
02:13:31.80 --> 02:13:33.80
That's where it starts to hurt.

1750
02:13:33.80 --> 02:13:37.80
She lives with Uncle Jake, and she wants that podcast.

1751
02:13:37.80 --> 02:13:39.80
So, I apologize.

1752
02:13:39.80 --> 02:13:42.80
I got one more book, do you?

1753
02:13:42.80 --> 02:13:44.80
January 31st.

1754
02:13:44.80 --> 02:13:47.80
Oh, book, like, you're writing?

1755
02:13:47.80 --> 02:13:49.80
And so, when that book is done,

1756
02:13:49.80 --> 02:13:51.80
we're going to make this happen.

1757
02:13:51.80 --> 02:13:53.80
So, yeah, subscribe to those as well.

1758
02:13:53.80 --> 02:13:56.80
We got a YouTube channel if you want to see Ecos videos.

1759
02:13:56.80 --> 02:13:58.80
And more important in seeing Ecos videos,

1760
02:13:58.80 --> 02:14:01.80
it's important to understand who the assistant director is

1761
02:14:01.80 --> 02:14:03.80
on many of those videos, and that's me.

1762
02:14:03.80 --> 02:14:06.80
So, if you like the videos, it's probably because the assistant

1763
02:14:06.80 --> 02:14:07.80
directing was strong.

1764
02:14:07.80 --> 02:14:10.80
If you don't like, I'm probably one I wasn't working on,

1765
02:14:10.80 --> 02:14:12.80
and Ecos screwed it up.

1766
02:14:12.80 --> 02:14:14.80
I'm only doing the best I can.

1767
02:14:14.80 --> 02:14:16.80
Anyway, thank you for that, by the way.

1768
02:14:16.80 --> 02:14:18.80
Also, psychological warfare.

1769
02:14:18.80 --> 02:14:22.80
It's an MP3 album with tracks of Jockel letting you know,

1770
02:14:22.80 --> 02:14:24.80
hey, don't skip this workout, right?

1771
02:14:24.80 --> 02:14:26.80
Because, you know, when you want to skip the workout,

1772
02:14:26.80 --> 02:14:28.80
Dave doesn't know.

1773
02:14:28.80 --> 02:14:29.80
Why? Because he doesn't work out?

1774
02:14:29.80 --> 02:14:30.80
He's disciplined.

1775
02:14:30.80 --> 02:14:31.80
He's disciplined.

1776
02:14:31.80 --> 02:14:32.80
He's disciplined.

1777
02:14:32.80 --> 02:14:33.80
He's getting it done.

1778
02:14:33.80 --> 02:14:35.80
Is that factually true?

1779
02:14:35.80 --> 02:14:37.80
My wife will not.

1780
02:14:37.80 --> 02:14:39.80
I will not hear the end of it.

1781
02:14:39.80 --> 02:14:40.80
I will not hear the end of it.

1782
02:14:40.80 --> 02:14:43.80
So, I have some motivation just to not put up with the harassment.

1783
02:14:43.80 --> 02:14:46.80
We need to make an album with your wife.

1784
02:14:46.80 --> 02:14:49.80
Yeah, trying to say, your wife is the psychological warfare.

1785
02:14:49.80 --> 02:14:53.80
The worst day in the broadcast hold is when I don't work out and she does.

1786
02:14:53.80 --> 02:14:56.80
That's just like, it's, there's enough motivation there to make sure

1787
02:14:56.80 --> 02:14:58.80
that doesn't happen very often.

1788
02:14:58.80 --> 02:14:59.80
Perfect.

1789
02:14:59.80 --> 02:15:00.80
And that's kind of like a little example.

1790
02:15:00.80 --> 02:15:02.80
Because you're going to like about that, it's like,

1791
02:15:02.80 --> 02:15:04.80
hey, it doesn't matter.

1792
02:15:04.80 --> 02:15:07.80
You worked from 4 o'clock in the morning until whenever.

1793
02:15:07.80 --> 02:15:09.80
It's like, oh, didn't work out today, did you?

1794
02:15:09.80 --> 02:15:10.80
Don't care.

1795
02:15:10.80 --> 02:15:11.80
Skip it.

1796
02:15:11.80 --> 02:15:12.80
Just kidding.

1797
02:15:12.80 --> 02:15:16.80
Well, for those of us who do entertain the notion of skipping and

1798
02:15:16.80 --> 02:15:19.80
work out, you know, fudging on the diet, all that kind of stuff.

1799
02:15:19.80 --> 02:15:21.80
We just encyclological warfare.

1800
02:15:21.80 --> 02:15:23.80
I don't get you through 100%.

1801
02:15:23.80 --> 02:15:24.80
Like a little spot.

1802
02:15:24.80 --> 02:15:25.80
Get it, you know, Amazon.

1803
02:15:25.80 --> 02:15:27.80
Where everybody in B3's is where you can get it.

1804
02:15:27.80 --> 02:15:29.80
Also, flipside canvas.com to code a Meyer.

1805
02:15:29.80 --> 02:15:32.80
He's making all kinds of cool stuff for you to hang on your wall.

1806
02:15:32.80 --> 02:15:35.80
We got a bunch of books about face by hack worth.

1807
02:15:35.80 --> 02:15:38.80
I wrote the forward to the new version of that leadership strategy and tactics field manual.

1808
02:15:38.80 --> 02:15:40.80
We got the code, the evaluation of protocols.

We got discipline, because freedom field manual brand new version.

02:15:50.80 --> 02:15:52.80

Suppointed all the other ones.

1815
02:15:54.80 --> 02:15:55.80
And now it's just in the cycle.

1816
02:15:55.80 --> 02:15:57.80
My son that was just super stoked on that one.

1817
02:15:57.80 --> 02:15:59.80
Outstanding to hear.

Oh, a client or talking to one of our clients.

02:18:05.80 --> 02:18:06.80
firefighters, paramedics,

1863
02:18:06.80 --> 02:18:08.80
EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers,

1864
02:18:08.80 --> 02:18:10.80
barter patrol, secret service,

1865
02:18:10.80 --> 02:18:12.80
and all first responders,

1866
02:18:12.80 --> 02:18:17.80
thank you for keeping us safe when we call on you in our worst moments.

1867
02:18:17.80 --> 02:18:19.80
And that everyone else out there,

1868
02:18:19.80 --> 02:18:24.80
you are competing all the time.

1869
02:18:24.80 --> 02:18:26.80
Know that.

1870
02:18:26.80 --> 02:18:28.80
Pay attention to it.

1871
02:18:28.80 --> 02:18:33.80
Pay attention to it so you can learn and you can get better

1872
02:18:33.80 --> 02:18:38.80
and you can be better and you can make the things in your world

1873
02:18:38.80 --> 02:18:40.80
a little bit better.

1874
02:18:40.80 --> 02:18:43.80
A little bit better for you.

1875
02:18:43.80 --> 02:18:46.80
And for the people around you.

1876
02:18:46.80 --> 02:18:50.80
And you do that by going out there every single day

1877
02:18:50.80 --> 02:18:53.80
and getting after it.

1878
02:18:53.80 --> 02:18:55.80
And until next time,

1879
02:18:55.80 --> 02:18:58.80
this is Dave, Eneko, and Jocco.

1880
02:18:58.80 --> 02:19:26.80
Out.
