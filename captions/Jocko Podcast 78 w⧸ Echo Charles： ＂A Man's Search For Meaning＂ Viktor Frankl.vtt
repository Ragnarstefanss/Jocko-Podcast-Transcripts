00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.80
This is Jocco podcast number 78 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:07.80 --> 00:00:09.30
Good evening, echo.

3
00:00:09.30 --> 00:00:12.80
Good evening.

4
00:00:12.80 --> 00:00:16.000
Nightmare.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.20
Now that's a word that I use often times to describe the most horrible things and the most

6
00:00:24.20 --> 00:00:38.40
wretched things and in my hierarchy of adjectives, nightmare is right alongside of hell.

7
00:00:38.40 --> 00:00:41.80
And I'm not sure which one is worse in my mind.

8
00:00:41.80 --> 00:00:47.84
That's why I say they're right alongside each other because hell is beyond the worst thing

9
00:00:47.84 --> 00:00:49.48
your mind can imagine.

10
00:00:49.48 --> 00:00:58.68
And that's basically what a nightmare is when you're asleep and your mind delves into

11
00:00:58.68 --> 00:01:05.20
the most horrific things beyond what you can consciously and willfully imagine in your

12
00:01:05.20 --> 00:01:09.000
own head.

13
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.48
That's what a nightmare is.

14
00:01:10.48 --> 00:01:19.40
Now what if there was a place that was worse than a

15
00:01:19.40 --> 00:01:22.60
nightmare?

16
00:01:22.60 --> 00:01:26.60
And it was a real place.

17
00:01:26.60 --> 00:01:36.28
Who could create such a place?

18
00:01:36.28 --> 00:01:44.48
And the answer to that is we can.

19
00:01:44.48 --> 00:01:50.000
I shall never forget how I was roused one night by the groans of a fellow prisoner who

20
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.92
threw himself about and asleep obviously having a horrible nightmare.

21
00:01:57.92 --> 00:02:01.96
Since I had always been especially sorry for people who suffer from fearful dreams or

22
00:02:01.96 --> 00:02:06.24
deliria, I wanted to wake the poor man.

23
00:02:06.24 --> 00:02:10.40
Suddenly I drew back the hand which was ready to shake him frightened at the thing I was

24
00:02:10.40 --> 00:02:13.08
about to do.

25
00:02:13.08 --> 00:02:21.60
At that moment I became intensely conscious of the fact that no dream no matter how horrible

26
00:02:21.60 --> 00:02:29.40
could be as bad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us and to which I was about

27
00:02:29.40 --> 00:02:34.20
to recall him.

28
00:02:34.20 --> 00:02:41.88
And that's a quote from the book, Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Franco which will

29
00:02:41.88 --> 00:02:45.24
be appearing in two today.

30
00:02:45.24 --> 00:02:55.72
And it's a book about the Nazi concentration camps which are really as he pointed out

31
00:02:55.72 --> 00:03:02.28
there worse than any nightmare we can imagine.

32
00:03:02.28 --> 00:03:05.88
Here's a Holocaust survivor.

33
00:03:05.88 --> 00:03:15.28
He won't be Weinstein on the death and the atrocities in Treblinka.

34
00:03:15.28 --> 00:03:18.12
By now the transports were coming every day.

35
00:03:18.12 --> 00:03:23.80
One was much like the next, the same incidents recurred again and again.

36
00:03:23.80 --> 00:03:28.84
Once as I swept out the interior of a car, an SS man suddenly struck me with his weapon

37
00:03:28.84 --> 00:03:34.60
ordered me to help a woman who was unable to stand and climb out of the car.

38
00:03:34.60 --> 00:03:40.52
The idea was to show his victims how well the ill would be treated.

39
00:03:40.52 --> 00:03:46.68
Then he ordered one of the workers to take the woman to the field, the field hospital

40
00:03:46.68 --> 00:03:49.000
for care.

41
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.64
The newcomers really believed that the alien woman would be taken to an infermary.

42
00:03:55.64 --> 00:04:01.84
None of them realized that the field hospital was in fact just a giant pit about 30 yards

43
00:04:01.84 --> 00:04:06.000
in diameter which was always a blaze.

44
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.20
They would place those who were sick or disabled on the ground at the edge of the pit facing

45
00:04:12.20 --> 00:04:13.52
in.

46
00:04:13.52 --> 00:04:19.72
The SS man in charge circulated among them and shot them in the back of the neck.

47
00:04:19.72 --> 00:04:22.96
Then the workers cast them into the pit.

48
00:04:22.96 --> 00:04:28.52
Some of the victims were still breathing when they were tossed in with the other bodies.

49
00:04:28.52 --> 00:04:34.64
The pit was separated from the spacious field by a barrier of fresh pine branches which

50
00:04:34.64 --> 00:04:40.24
were replaced from time to time to conceal the infirmary from the newcomers until the last

51
00:04:40.24 --> 00:04:42.60
moment.

52
00:04:42.60 --> 00:04:47.04
20 minutes after I helped the woman climb out of the railroad car, I was told that some

53
00:04:47.04 --> 00:04:53.28
infants were sitting by the pit and no one else was there because the SS soldier had taken

54
00:04:53.28 --> 00:04:55.20
his lunch break.

55
00:04:55.20 --> 00:04:58.96
I gathered some trash and went over there.

56
00:04:58.96 --> 00:05:02.96
I saw the woman who I had removed from the car, still breathing, sitting at the edge

57
00:05:02.96 --> 00:05:08.32
of the pit and staring in fright into the burning inferno and its contents.

58
00:05:08.32 --> 00:05:16.32
The half-cremated bodies of old people and children mixed with smoldering trash.

59
00:05:16.32 --> 00:05:21.32
She tried to stand up but her legs would not hold her.

60
00:05:21.32 --> 00:05:27.44
She looked at the workers who stirred the embers remnants of human beings so they would burn

61
00:05:27.44 --> 00:05:31.44
better.

62
00:05:31.44 --> 00:05:34.92
Nearby we were about a dozen infants.

63
00:05:34.92 --> 00:05:38.72
Too young to have learned how to walk, they were not crying.

64
00:05:38.72 --> 00:05:42.40
They certainly did not understand what was happening.

65
00:05:42.40 --> 00:05:49.08
They looked about almost certainly in hopes of finding their mother or father.

66
00:05:49.08 --> 00:05:53.64
Later I heard that right after he returned from his lunch break, the SS man shot them all

67
00:05:53.64 --> 00:05:59.24
and ordered the workers to throw the tiny bodies into the flames.

68
00:05:59.24 --> 00:06:08.000
Of all my memories of that accursed place, the vision of these babies is undoubtedly the worst.

69
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.24
I see their faces whenever I remember Trimblinka.

70
00:06:13.24 --> 00:06:28.56
As I write these lines more than 50 years after that day, I still cannot overcome the horror.

71
00:06:28.56 --> 00:06:36.48
In another report, here Martin's Spet of Tarnow, Poland, describes the massacre of Tarnow

72
00:06:36.48 --> 00:06:40.68
Jews in an interview.

73
00:06:40.68 --> 00:06:44.48
We heard the columns of Jews under German escort at night.

74
00:06:44.48 --> 00:06:46.96
It was going constantly.

75
00:06:46.96 --> 00:06:51.76
They were passing our house because this was already on the outskirts of the city, the

76
00:06:51.76 --> 00:06:56.68
cemetery and they were marching them to the woods behind the city.

77
00:06:56.68 --> 00:07:01.36
As we found out later, they were all shot over there.

78
00:07:01.36 --> 00:07:03.48
During the day I looked out through the shingles.

79
00:07:03.48 --> 00:07:09.84
My father said I shouldn't look but anyway, I was a kid, I was curious.

80
00:07:09.84 --> 00:07:16.36
The roof was overlooking the cemetery and wagons with bodies dead bodies were coming in.

81
00:07:16.36 --> 00:07:22.28
Groups, they were bringing in groups of Jewish people that had to dig trenches.

82
00:07:22.28 --> 00:07:26.88
They had to dig ditches and the bodies dumped in.

83
00:07:26.88 --> 00:07:33.36
After those Jews that dug the ditches, they were shot also and pushed in by another

84
00:07:33.36 --> 00:07:39.60
group that came in after them into those ditches and lime was poured over the bodies.

85
00:07:39.60 --> 00:07:48.84
The next group covered up those ditches and dug other ditches.

86
00:07:48.84 --> 00:07:59.44
They brought in pregnant women and they didn't use any bullets.

87
00:07:59.44 --> 00:08:04.20
They used bayonets.

88
00:08:04.20 --> 00:08:16.32
The screams of the mothers that their children, they tore their children out of their arms

89
00:08:16.32 --> 00:08:27.56
and the screams of the children, I still hear.

90
00:08:27.56 --> 00:08:40.36
The Solomon Redaski, who is the only survivor from the 78 people in his family.

91
00:08:40.36 --> 00:08:49.56
Described the concentration camp, they throw the people in the crematoriums that children.

92
00:08:49.56 --> 00:08:54.44
I will never forget alive.

93
00:08:54.44 --> 00:09:00.04
They throw them in the crematoriums.

94
00:09:00.04 --> 00:09:05.08
They grabbed by an arm, by a leg, by the head and throw them into the ovens.

95
00:09:05.08 --> 00:09:07.68
There it was so tragic.

96
00:09:07.68 --> 00:09:15.48
The cries and people, when crying there, you know it was so terrible.

97
00:09:15.48 --> 00:09:16.84
I can feel it now.

98
00:09:16.84 --> 00:09:21.20
I can even see the people.

99
00:09:21.20 --> 00:09:28.88
The other people were crying, the children were hollering, Mama Daddy helped me.

100
00:09:28.88 --> 00:09:35.60
Mama Daddy helped me.

101
00:09:35.60 --> 00:09:46.000
It was terrible.

102
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.92
One more report, not Trublinka, from Henry Gold.

103
00:09:53.92 --> 00:10:00.24
The worst thing that happens to a person in that instance, he loses self-respect, and

104
00:10:00.24 --> 00:10:04.16
that's exactly what happened to the majority of the people.

105
00:10:04.16 --> 00:10:06.000
Some of them even lost their minds.

106
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.12
They couldn't take it.

107
00:10:08.12 --> 00:10:09.40
They couldn't take the hunger.

108
00:10:09.40 --> 00:10:10.80
They couldn't take the beatings.

109
00:10:10.80 --> 00:10:15.68
They couldn't take the cold, no clothing, and the uncertainty.

110
00:10:15.68 --> 00:10:19.80
And the uncertainty, I think that was the worst thing that could happen to a person.

111
00:10:19.80 --> 00:10:24.44
You didn't know from one moment to the next what was going to happen.

112
00:10:24.44 --> 00:10:25.72
Life was very cheap.

113
00:10:25.72 --> 00:10:27.52
A person was alive one minute.

114
00:10:27.52 --> 00:10:34.20
The next minute he was shot, killed, beaten up, beaten to death, torn apart by dogs, and so

115
00:10:34.20 --> 00:10:37.20
on.

116
00:10:37.20 --> 00:10:43.32
Life was very, very cheap, and that's the way the Germans liked it.

117
00:10:43.32 --> 00:10:48.36
That particular camp was governed by the Jewish police and so on.

118
00:10:48.36 --> 00:10:50.28
The Germans did not stay in the camp.

119
00:10:50.28 --> 00:10:54.24
They were on the outside.

120
00:10:54.24 --> 00:10:59.92
But the life inside of the camp was just as bad without the Germans being right there

121
00:10:59.92 --> 00:11:03.04
than if they would be.

122
00:11:03.04 --> 00:11:08.20
The Jewish police was, I don't know.

123
00:11:08.20 --> 00:11:12.64
You take a person in that situation, and you give them a little power, and he becomes

124
00:11:12.64 --> 00:11:17.40
the same as the oppressor himself.

125
00:11:17.40 --> 00:11:24.96
There were some policemen that were not bad, but there were a lot of them that were ruthless.

126
00:11:24.96 --> 00:11:28.56
There were others that would beat people, and do all kinds of things that would degrade

127
00:11:28.56 --> 00:11:32.64
them and so on, especially women.

128
00:11:32.64 --> 00:11:35.20
They cut their hair off, and they looked like men.

129
00:11:35.20 --> 00:11:40.20
They looked like scarecrows, and they would get beaten up by the Jewish police just as bad

130
00:11:40.20 --> 00:11:45.32
as the man for no reason at all.

131
00:11:45.32 --> 00:11:50.68
If they wanted a little more soup, where they were distributing soup, and there was some

132
00:11:50.68 --> 00:11:55.44
left, and they were going to give everybody a little bit, and the Jewish police with their

133
00:11:55.44 --> 00:12:03.56
sticks and rubber hoses would beat them half-centeless.

134
00:12:03.56 --> 00:12:07.72
That's what happens when the conditions are the way they were then.

135
00:12:07.72 --> 00:12:13.96
When a person becomes an animal, and loses self-respect, that is willing to get a beating,

136
00:12:13.96 --> 00:12:21.16
and get beaten half-centeless just to get a little bit of soup.

137
00:12:21.16 --> 00:12:29.04
Either you died, or if you didn't die, the Germans would come and take you away.

138
00:12:29.04 --> 00:12:32.36
The filth was just terrible in the camp.

139
00:12:32.36 --> 00:12:33.88
In the barracks you had caught.

140
00:12:33.88 --> 00:12:40.24
I mean, bonks were everybody slept on straw, there were no covers, was no pillows, nothing.

141
00:12:40.24 --> 00:12:43.96
You slept in your clothes and the winners, and the winner because you're afraid to get

142
00:12:43.96 --> 00:12:45.84
cold.

143
00:12:45.84 --> 00:12:49.56
The only heating was a pop belly stove in the middle of the barrack.

144
00:12:49.56 --> 00:12:53.44
When somebody stole some wood in the factory or something, then we had a fire otherwise

145
00:12:53.44 --> 00:12:57.08
it was freezing.

146
00:12:57.08 --> 00:13:04.16
They only warmth they had if you huddled together and they kept warm that way, but nobody

147
00:13:04.16 --> 00:13:06.92
would get undressed.

148
00:13:06.92 --> 00:13:10.20
The lights were eating you up alive.

149
00:13:10.20 --> 00:13:14.48
Once a month you were allowed to take a shower, and we had to walk to camp a to go to the

150
00:13:14.48 --> 00:13:19.60
showers, and that means a 10-mile walk.

151
00:13:19.60 --> 00:13:23.84
10 miles there and 10 miles back.

152
00:13:23.84 --> 00:13:30.52
There were a lot of people were too weak to walk, and those people hardly ever took a shower.

153
00:13:30.52 --> 00:13:34.64
There was no hot water in the washer, there was only cold, and in the winter you were

154
00:13:34.64 --> 00:13:39.80
afraid to wash up because there was nothing to wipe yourself with, therefore you would

155
00:13:39.80 --> 00:13:50.80
walk out in the cold, winter, and freeze to death.

156
00:13:50.80 --> 00:14:02.64
And we gold, brothers and both of his parents were all killed in the gas chambers.

157
00:14:02.64 --> 00:14:09.40
And from the Boocan walled report, which was translated and edited with an introduction

158
00:14:09.40 --> 00:14:16.68
by David A. Hackett, I will now describe the crematoriums and the transports.

159
00:14:16.68 --> 00:14:20.56
With the station 2,000 people got off the trains.

160
00:14:20.56 --> 00:14:23.40
They had to throw away all their luggage.

161
00:14:23.40 --> 00:14:27.88
Afterwards, the men and women were divided into two groups, at which the larger boys were

162
00:14:27.88 --> 00:14:32.28
assigned to the group with the men.

163
00:14:32.28 --> 00:14:37.20
Then that great devour of Jews, Mengala drove by and a car seeking out the strongest

164
00:14:37.20 --> 00:14:40.28
from each transport.

165
00:14:40.28 --> 00:14:43.92
They numbered around 30 out of 2,000.

166
00:14:43.92 --> 00:14:52.48
The remainder were led away by SS Technical Sergeant Moll, the officer of the crematorium.

167
00:14:52.48 --> 00:14:56.12
The elderly were loaded onto dump trucks and then dumped into burning trenches while

168
00:14:56.12 --> 00:14:59.32
still alive.

169
00:14:59.32 --> 00:15:03.68
The remainder were led to the gas chambers.

170
00:15:03.68 --> 00:15:07.36
Meanwhile new transports were arriving.

171
00:15:07.36 --> 00:15:11.60
In front of the gas chamber was a dressing room.

172
00:15:11.60 --> 00:15:16.56
Its walls were written in all languages, put shoes into the cubby holes and tie them together

173
00:15:16.56 --> 00:15:19.36
so you will not lose them.

174
00:15:19.36 --> 00:15:24.84
After the showers, you will receive hot coffee.

175
00:15:24.84 --> 00:15:30.96
Here poor victims undress themselves and went into the chamber.

176
00:15:30.96 --> 00:15:36.52
There were three columns for the ventilators through which the gas poured in.

177
00:15:36.52 --> 00:15:41.92
Special worked detail with trungeons drove the people into the chamber.

178
00:15:41.92 --> 00:15:47.24
When the room was full, small children were thrown in through a window.

179
00:15:47.24 --> 00:15:54.92
Sergeant Moll grabbed, infants by their legs and smashed their skulls against the wall.

180
00:15:54.92 --> 00:15:58.24
Then the gas was led into the chamber.

181
00:15:58.24 --> 00:16:02.60
The lungs of the victim slowly burst and after three minutes allowed clamoring could

182
00:16:02.60 --> 00:16:05.32
be heard.

183
00:16:05.32 --> 00:16:17.64
And the chamber was open and those who still showed signs of life were beaten to death.

184
00:16:17.64 --> 00:16:23.40
The prisoners of the special work details then pulled corpses out took their rings off

185
00:16:23.40 --> 00:16:29.32
and cut their hair which was gathered up, put in sacks and shipped to factories.

186
00:16:29.32 --> 00:16:34.28
Then they arranged the corpses in piles of ten each.

187
00:16:34.28 --> 00:16:39.84
After Sergeant Moll had counted them, they were taken to the ovens or if the crematoriums,

188
00:16:39.84 --> 00:16:45.84
crematoriums were insufficient thrown into fire trenches.

189
00:16:45.84 --> 00:16:49.96
Once it happened that a victim crawled out of a burning trench, he was beaten to death with

190
00:16:49.96 --> 00:16:54.12
trungeons.

191
00:16:54.12 --> 00:17:01.36
While Sergeant Moll put a naked woman in the trench and shot her in the genitals, another

192
00:17:01.36 --> 00:17:05.32
time Moll found a ring on a member of the special work detail.

193
00:17:05.32 --> 00:17:12.76
He ordered, nap, nap the poured over him and had it lighted.

194
00:17:12.76 --> 00:17:18.72
He hanged a man by his hands and shot him until his arms were torn through.

195
00:17:18.72 --> 00:17:25.08
Then he hanged him up by the feet and repeated the process.

196
00:17:25.08 --> 00:17:31.000
While Sergeant Moll took a family of six, first he shot the youngest in the presence

197
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:45.32
of the rest, then he shot the older ones and finally their father and mother.

198
00:17:45.32 --> 00:18:03.32
That's the testimony of John DeWise, who was 15 years old at Burknow.

199
00:18:03.32 --> 00:18:15.28
So I think it's safe to say that this is a situation that has definitely worse than a nightmare.

200
00:18:15.28 --> 00:18:24.96
And what possibly can we take away from that?

201
00:18:24.96 --> 00:18:35.80
I think the best thing we can do is try and learn.

202
00:18:35.80 --> 00:18:42.40
And I think one of the best places to learn and take lessons away from the Holocaust is from

203
00:18:42.40 --> 00:18:53.44
the book that I started out with today called Man Search for Meaning by Victor Franco.

204
00:18:53.44 --> 00:19:02.48
Let's go to the book.

205
00:19:02.48 --> 00:19:07.12
Let us take the case of a transport, which was officially announced to transfer a certain

206
00:19:07.12 --> 00:19:09.56
number of prisoners to another camp.

207
00:19:09.56 --> 00:19:15.08
But it was fairly safe to guess that its final destination would be the gas chambers.

208
00:19:15.08 --> 00:19:20.56
A selection of sick or feeble prisoners incapable of work would be sent to one of the big

209
00:19:20.56 --> 00:19:26.08
central camps which were fitted with gas chambers and crematoriums.

210
00:19:26.08 --> 00:19:34.000
The selection process was the signal for a free fight among all the prisoners, or of group

211
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.92
against group.

212
00:19:36.92 --> 00:19:42.84
All that matter was that one's own name and that of one's friends were crossed off the

213
00:19:42.84 --> 00:19:48.40
list of victims, though everyone knew that for each man saved another victim had to be

214
00:19:48.40 --> 00:19:51.32
found.

215
00:19:51.32 --> 00:19:56.16
A definite number of prisoners had to go with each transport.

216
00:19:56.16 --> 00:20:02.80
It did not really matter which since each of them was nothing but a number.

217
00:20:02.80 --> 00:20:08.36
On their admission to the camp, all their documents had been taken from them, together

218
00:20:08.36 --> 00:20:10.64
with other possessions.

219
00:20:10.64 --> 00:20:14.72
Each prisoner therefore had an opportunity to claim a fictitious name or profession

220
00:20:14.72 --> 00:20:18.32
and for various reasons many did this.

221
00:20:18.32 --> 00:20:23.12
The authorities were interested only in the captive's numbers.

222
00:20:23.12 --> 00:20:27.44
These numbers were often tattooed on their skin and also had to be sewn to a certain

223
00:20:27.44 --> 00:20:31.64
spot on their trousers jacket or coat.

224
00:20:31.64 --> 00:20:37.36
He guard who wanted to make a charge against a prisoner just a glance that is number.

225
00:20:37.36 --> 00:20:39.96
And how we dreaded those glances.

226
00:20:39.96 --> 00:20:43.64
He never asked for his name.

227
00:20:43.64 --> 00:20:47.96
To return to the convoy about to depart, there was neither time nor desire to consider

228
00:20:47.96 --> 00:20:50.20
moral or ethical issues.

229
00:20:50.20 --> 00:20:55.000
Every man was controlled by one fought only to keep himself alive for the family waiting

230
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.88
for him at home and to save his friends.

231
00:20:59.88 --> 00:21:05.84
If no hesitation therefore he would arrange for another prisoner another number to take

232
00:21:05.84 --> 00:21:11.000
his place in the transport.

233
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.88
As I have already mentioned, the process of selecting capos was a negative one.

234
00:21:16.88 --> 00:21:22.76
Only the most brutal of the prisoners were chosen for this job.

235
00:21:22.76 --> 00:21:33.12
So capos were prisoners, Jewish prisoners that got selected to help run the prison camp.

236
00:21:33.12 --> 00:21:40.36
And capo, I tried to find the etymology of where that came from and the best or the closest

237
00:21:40.36 --> 00:21:46.56
or the thing that made the most sense to me from what I read was, was they had two words

238
00:21:46.56 --> 00:21:48.84
combined together.

239
00:21:48.84 --> 00:21:57.52
Tom Rad Police and the German those got shortened to capo.

240
00:21:57.52 --> 00:22:02.52
So some of these and you already heard one of those earlier testimonies talking about

241
00:22:02.52 --> 00:22:09.68
the Jewish police inside the prisons and how they were just as bad as in many cases

242
00:22:09.68 --> 00:22:13.36
as the Germans themselves.

243
00:22:13.36 --> 00:22:14.36
Back to the book.

244
00:22:14.36 --> 00:22:18.08
But apart from the selection of capos which was undertaken by the SS there was a sort

245
00:22:18.08 --> 00:22:26.000
of self-selecting process going on the whole time among all the prisoners.

246
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.96
On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who.

247
00:22:30.96 --> 00:22:36.04
After years of trekking from camp to camp had lost all scruples in their fight for

248
00:22:36.04 --> 00:22:37.32
existence.

249
00:22:37.32 --> 00:22:43.04
They were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise even brutal force, theft and

250
00:22:43.04 --> 00:22:49.84
betrayal of friends in order to save themselves.

251
00:22:49.84 --> 00:22:57.12
We have come back by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles, whatever one may choose

252
00:22:57.12 --> 00:22:58.68
to call them.

253
00:22:58.68 --> 00:23:10.16
We know the best of us did not return.

254
00:23:10.16 --> 00:23:14.96
So there is a dynamic that you don't think of immediately when you think of the concentration

255
00:23:14.96 --> 00:23:15.96
camps.

256
00:23:15.96 --> 00:23:20.36
Number one, you don't think about the capos, the Jewish police that are forced into this

257
00:23:20.36 --> 00:23:21.36
situation.

258
00:23:21.36 --> 00:23:25.12
And then the other thing you don't think about is this the fact that the people that

259
00:23:25.12 --> 00:23:31.08
we're going to survive were basically making a very broad say.

260
00:23:31.08 --> 00:23:35.92
But from what Victor Frankl saying here, it was the people that were willing just to do

261
00:23:35.92 --> 00:23:38.48
anything to survive, including betraying their friends.

262
00:23:38.48 --> 00:23:43.52
And he's saying straight up, we know the best of us did not return.

263
00:23:43.52 --> 00:23:52.08
And that is something that you don't think about.

264
00:23:52.08 --> 00:23:55.76
And we probably don't think about it because we don't want to think about it.

265
00:23:55.76 --> 00:24:00.80
Because when you start thinking about what would you do to survive?

266
00:24:00.80 --> 00:24:02.68
What would you do to survive?

267
00:24:02.68 --> 00:24:06.08
What would I do to survive?

268
00:24:06.08 --> 00:24:11.52
That's a question. I don't think a lot of people want to know the answer to.

269
00:24:11.52 --> 00:24:16.20
And it's very easy to go through life and never have to answer that question.

270
00:24:16.20 --> 00:24:27.68
Just talking a little bit now about what life was like in the camp.

271
00:24:27.68 --> 00:24:28.68
Back to the book.

272
00:24:28.68 --> 00:24:31.84
Somewhere it is said that man cannot exist without sleep for more than a stated number

273
00:24:31.84 --> 00:24:32.84
of hours.

274
00:24:32.84 --> 00:24:34.64
Quite wrong.

275
00:24:34.64 --> 00:24:38.68
I had been convinced that there were certain things I just could not do.

276
00:24:38.68 --> 00:24:44.48
I could not sleep without this or I could not live without that or the other.

277
00:24:44.48 --> 00:24:50.68
The first night in Auschwitz, we slept in beds which were constructed in tears.

278
00:24:50.68 --> 00:24:56.52
On each tier, measuring about six and one half to eight feet slept nine men.

279
00:24:56.52 --> 00:24:58.84
Directly on the boards.

280
00:24:58.84 --> 00:25:03.88
Two blankets would be shared by each nine men.

281
00:25:03.88 --> 00:25:09.32
We could of course lie only on our sides, crowded and huddled against each other,

282
00:25:09.32 --> 00:25:13.08
which had some advantages because of the bitter cold.

283
00:25:13.08 --> 00:25:18.60
Though it was forbidden to take shoes up to the bunks, some people did use them secretly

284
00:25:18.60 --> 00:25:22.04
as pillows, and spite of the fact that they were caked with mud.

285
00:25:22.04 --> 00:25:29.40
Otherwise, one's head had to rest on the crook of an almost dislocated arm.

286
00:25:29.40 --> 00:25:39.72
And yet sleep came and brought oblivion and relief from the pain for a few hours.

287
00:25:39.72 --> 00:25:45.92
The thaw to suicide was entertained by nearly everyone, if only for a brief time.

288
00:25:45.92 --> 00:25:51.48
It was born of hopelessness of the situation, the constant danger of death looming over us

289
00:25:51.48 --> 00:25:58.28
daily and hourly, and the closeness of deaths suffered by many of the others.

290
00:25:58.28 --> 00:26:03.52
In personal convictions, which we mentioned later, I made a firm promise on my first evening

291
00:26:03.52 --> 00:26:07.52
in the camp that I would not run to the wire.

292
00:26:07.52 --> 00:26:12.000
This was a phrase used in camp to describe the most popular method of suicide, touching

293
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.52
the electrical, electrically charged barbed wire fence.

294
00:26:15.52 --> 00:26:20.24
It was not entirely difficult for me to make this decision.

295
00:26:20.24 --> 00:26:25.28
There was little point committing suicide since, for the average inmate, life expectation

296
00:26:25.28 --> 00:26:32.40
calculating objectively and counting all likely chances was very poor.

297
00:26:32.40 --> 00:26:35.88
You could not without any assurance, you could not with any assurance expect to be among

298
00:26:35.88 --> 00:26:40.48
the small percentage of men who survived all the selections.

299
00:26:40.48 --> 00:26:45.92
The prisoner of Auschwitz, in the first phase of shock, did not fear death.

300
00:26:45.92 --> 00:26:52.52
Even the gas chambers lost their horrors for him after the first few days after all.

301
00:26:52.52 --> 00:27:02.52
They spared him the act of committing suicide.

302
00:27:02.52 --> 00:27:11.76
Victor Frankle was a psychiatrist going into this situation.

303
00:27:11.76 --> 00:27:17.04
That's the view, that's the perspective that he takes throughout this.

304
00:27:17.04 --> 00:27:27.76
He's now been in for a couple days in Auschwitz and another guy comes into talk to him,

305
00:27:27.76 --> 00:27:30.08
who's another colleague of his.

306
00:27:30.08 --> 00:27:33.16
And we're going back to the book, a colleague of mine who had arrived in Auschwitz several

307
00:27:33.16 --> 00:27:36.72
weeks previously smuggled himself into our hut.

308
00:27:36.72 --> 00:27:40.16
He wanted a common comfort us and tell us a few things.

309
00:27:40.16 --> 00:27:44.56
He had become so thin that at first we did not recognize him.

310
00:27:44.56 --> 00:27:49.84
With a show of good humor and a devil-made care attitude he gave us a few hurried tips.

311
00:27:49.84 --> 00:27:52.68
Don't be afraid, don't fear the selections.

312
00:27:52.68 --> 00:27:58.68
Dr. M, the SS medical chief, has a soft spot for doctors.

313
00:27:58.68 --> 00:28:04.28
But one thing I beg of you, he continued, shave daily if at all possible even if you have

314
00:28:04.28 --> 00:28:06.96
to use a piece of glass to do it.

315
00:28:06.96 --> 00:28:11.24
Even if you have to give your last piece of bread for it.

316
00:28:11.24 --> 00:28:16.28
You will look younger and the scraping will make your cheeks look rudier.

317
00:28:16.28 --> 00:28:19.56
If you want to stay alive, there is only one way.

318
00:28:19.56 --> 00:28:21.16
Look fit for work.

319
00:28:21.16 --> 00:28:26.84
If you even limp because let us say you have a small blister on your heel and an SS man

320
00:28:26.84 --> 00:28:40.72
spots this, he will wave you aside and the next day you are sure to be gasped.

321
00:28:40.72 --> 00:28:52.96
Now his mind and his thoughts, he describes what he would think about.

322
00:28:52.96 --> 00:28:58.04
Back to the book, my mind still clung to the image of my wife.

323
00:28:58.04 --> 00:29:03.20
A thought crossed my mind, I didn't even know if she was still alive.

324
00:29:03.20 --> 00:29:08.68
I knew only one thing which I have learned well by now.

325
00:29:08.68 --> 00:29:13.80
Love goes very far beyond the physical person of the beloved.

326
00:29:13.80 --> 00:29:19.52
It finds its deepest meaning in his spiritual being, in his inner self.

327
00:29:19.52 --> 00:29:23.80
Whether or not he is actually present, whether or not he is still alive at all ceases

328
00:29:23.80 --> 00:29:28.36
somehow to be of importance.

329
00:29:28.36 --> 00:29:35.000
I did not know whether my wife was alive and had no means of finding out.

330
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.72
Everything was happening all my present life, there was no outgoing or incoming male.

331
00:29:40.72 --> 00:29:45.000
But at that moment it ceased to matter.

332
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.80
There was no need for me to know nothing could touch the strength of my love, my thoughts

333
00:29:49.80 --> 00:29:53.72
and the image of my beloved.

334
00:29:53.72 --> 00:29:58.04
Had I known then that my wife was dead, I think that I still would have given myself

335
00:29:58.04 --> 00:30:02.56
undisturbed by that knowledge to the contemplation of her image.

336
00:30:02.56 --> 00:30:12.76
That my mental conversation with her would have been just as vivid and just as satisfying.

337
00:30:12.76 --> 00:30:28.000
Set me like a seal upon my heart, love is as strong as death.

338
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:37.08
And continuing on, Dr. Frankle talks about images from inside the camp.

339
00:30:37.08 --> 00:30:41.04
Standing outside we saw sinister clouds glowing in the west and the whole sky alive with

340
00:30:41.04 --> 00:30:47.12
clouds of ever-changing shapes and colors from steel blue to blood red.

341
00:30:47.12 --> 00:30:53.04
The desolate gray mud huts provided a sharp contrast while the puddles on the muddy ground

342
00:30:53.04 --> 00:30:57.36
reflected the glowing sky.

343
00:30:57.36 --> 00:31:02.96
And then after a few minutes of moving silence, one prisoner said to another, how beautiful

344
00:31:02.96 --> 00:31:08.88
the world could be.

345
00:31:08.88 --> 00:31:18.84
And beyond looking for beauty around them, they were able to find humor.

346
00:31:18.84 --> 00:31:23.64
And I have people ask me about this from time to time about humor and combat situations

347
00:31:23.64 --> 00:31:29.64
and isn't it important and yes it absolutely is, and you'd think in a concentration camp

348
00:31:29.64 --> 00:31:35.16
even humor would go away.

349
00:31:35.16 --> 00:31:39.84
But not true, back to the book to discover that there was any semblance of art in a concentration

350
00:31:39.84 --> 00:31:42.88
camp must be surprising enough for an outsider.

351
00:31:42.88 --> 00:31:49.16
But he may be even more astonished to hear that one could find a sense of humor.

352
00:31:49.16 --> 00:31:53.36
And if I'm not able to find a sense of humor there as well, of course only the faint trace

353
00:31:53.36 --> 00:31:54.36
of one.

354
00:31:54.36 --> 00:31:59.48
And then only for a few seconds or minutes, humor was another of the soul's weapons in the

355
00:31:59.48 --> 00:32:03.40
fight for self preservation.

356
00:32:03.40 --> 00:32:08.64
It is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human makeup, can afford an

357
00:32:08.64 --> 00:32:16.68
aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation if only for a few seconds.

358
00:32:16.68 --> 00:32:21.16
The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is some kind

359
00:32:21.16 --> 00:32:26.76
of trick I learned while mastering the art of living.

360
00:32:26.76 --> 00:32:31.40
Yet it is impossible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp although

361
00:32:31.40 --> 00:32:34.44
suffering is omnipresent.

362
00:32:34.44 --> 00:32:40.52
To draw an analogy, a man's suffering is similar to the behavior of gas.

363
00:32:40.52 --> 00:32:45.60
If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely

364
00:32:45.60 --> 00:32:50.000
and evenly no matter how big the chamber.

365
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.44
Thus, suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind no matter whether the

366
00:32:55.44 --> 00:32:59.52
suffering is great or little.

367
00:32:59.52 --> 00:33:08.16
Therefore the size of human suffering is absolutely relative.

368
00:33:08.16 --> 00:33:14.08
And I think the point that I took away from that was that chamber that can be filled up

369
00:33:14.08 --> 00:33:18.24
with suffering filled up with some humor as well.

370
00:33:18.24 --> 00:33:27.000
Otherwise that suffering will just fill the whole chamber, fill your whole brain.

371
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.04
Back to the book, we were grateful for the smallest of mercies.

372
00:33:30.04 --> 00:33:35.48
We were glad when there was time to delouse before going to bed.

373
00:33:35.48 --> 00:33:40.24
Although in itself this was no pressure as it meant standing naked and unheated

374
00:33:40.24 --> 00:33:44.80
hut where icicles hung from the ceiling.

375
00:33:44.80 --> 00:33:49.68
But we were thankful if there was no air raid alarm during this operation in the lights

376
00:33:49.68 --> 00:33:52.36
were not switched off.

377
00:33:52.36 --> 00:33:54.80
We could not do the job properly.

378
00:33:54.80 --> 00:34:04.48
We were kept awake half the night.

379
00:34:04.48 --> 00:34:10.64
So you're at a point in life where you're grateful for being able to stand naked and pick

380
00:34:10.64 --> 00:34:15.60
the lights off of your friends before you go to bed so that the lights won't keep you awake

381
00:34:15.60 --> 00:34:23.76
at night by chewing at your body.

382
00:34:23.76 --> 00:34:31.60
And you know I talked about how or he talks about how it was the person that was going

383
00:34:31.60 --> 00:34:36.24
to survive had to be ruthless basically.

384
00:34:36.24 --> 00:34:40.36
And here he says, but is not for me to pass judgment on those prisoners who put their own

385
00:34:40.36 --> 00:34:42.76
people above everyone else.

386
00:34:42.76 --> 00:34:46.64
Who controls snowen in a man who favors his friends under circumstances when sooner

387
00:34:46.64 --> 00:34:50.60
later it is a question of life or death.

388
00:34:50.60 --> 00:34:56.64
No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation

389
00:34:56.64 --> 00:35:06.64
he might not have done the same.

390
00:35:06.64 --> 00:35:11.64
And here he says, I mentioned earlier how everything that was not connected with the immediate

391
00:35:11.64 --> 00:35:18.72
task of keeping oneself in one closest friends of lives lost its value.

392
00:35:18.72 --> 00:35:22.76
Everything was sacrificed to this end.

393
00:35:22.76 --> 00:35:29.28
The man's character became involved to the point that he was caught in mental turmoil which

394
00:35:29.28 --> 00:35:33.88
threatened all values he held and threw them into doubt.

395
00:35:33.88 --> 00:35:38.52
Under the influence of a world which no longer recognized the value of human life and human

396
00:35:38.52 --> 00:35:44.68
dignity which had robbed the man of his will and made him an object to be exterminated,

397
00:35:44.68 --> 00:35:48.76
having planned however to make full use of him first to the last ounce of his physical

398
00:35:48.76 --> 00:35:56.92
resources under this influence the personal ego finally suffered a loss of values.

399
00:35:56.92 --> 00:36:01.92
If the man in the concentration camp did not struggle against this in a last effort to

400
00:36:01.92 --> 00:36:10.24
save his self respect he lost the feeling of being an individual, a being with a mind

401
00:36:10.24 --> 00:36:16.52
with inner freedom and personal value.

402
00:36:16.52 --> 00:36:23.12
He thought of himself then as only part of an enormous mass of people his existence descended

403
00:36:23.12 --> 00:36:28.20
to the level of animal life.

404
00:36:28.20 --> 00:36:32.80
The men were herded sometimes to one place then to another sometimes driven together

405
00:36:32.80 --> 00:36:39.80
than a part like a flock of sheep without a thought or a will of their own.

406
00:36:39.80 --> 00:36:45.000
A small but dangerous pack watched them from all sides well versed in methods of torture

407
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.84
and sadism.

408
00:36:47.84 --> 00:36:54.72
They drove the herd and sessingly backwards and forwards with shouts kicks and blows and

409
00:36:54.72 --> 00:37:00.32
we the sheep thought of two things only.

410
00:37:00.32 --> 00:37:15.44
How to evade the bad dogs and how to get a little food.

411
00:37:15.44 --> 00:37:23.92
He's going to delve into this deeper, this idea of this inner freedom and how hard you

412
00:37:23.92 --> 00:37:30.24
had to fight to maintain that and how easy it was just to roll in and become one of the

413
00:37:30.24 --> 00:37:36.40
pack one of the herd.

414
00:37:36.40 --> 00:37:40.96
Back to the book, it is very difficult for an outsider to grasp how very little value

415
00:37:40.96 --> 00:37:44.92
was placed on human life and camp.

416
00:37:44.92 --> 00:37:52.64
The camp inmate was hardened, possibly became more conscious of this complete disregard

417
00:37:52.64 --> 00:37:58.76
of human existence when a convoy of sick men was arranged.

418
00:37:58.76 --> 00:38:04.36
The initiated bodies of the sick were thrown on two wheeled carts which were drawn by prisoners

419
00:38:04.36 --> 00:38:09.56
for many miles, often through snowstorms to the next camp.

420
00:38:09.56 --> 00:38:14.92
If one of the sick men had died before the cart left, he was thrown on anyways.

421
00:38:14.92 --> 00:38:21.88
The list had to be correct, but the list was the only thing that mattered.

422
00:38:21.88 --> 00:38:26.04
A man counted only because he had a prison number.

423
00:38:26.04 --> 00:38:32.32
One literally became a number, dead or alive, that was unimportant.

424
00:38:32.32 --> 00:38:36.52
The life of a number was completely irrelevant.

425
00:38:36.52 --> 00:38:41.84
What stood behind that number and that life mattered even less.

426
00:38:41.84 --> 00:38:57.92
The fate, the history, the name of the man.

427
00:38:57.92 --> 00:39:03.24
The camp inmate was frightened of making decisions and of taking any sort of initiative

428
00:39:03.24 --> 00:39:06.24
whatsoever.

429
00:39:06.24 --> 00:39:11.40
This was the result of a strong feeling that fate was one's master and that one must

430
00:39:11.40 --> 00:39:19.56
not try to influence it in any way, but instead let it take its own course.

431
00:39:19.56 --> 00:39:26.04
In addition, there was a great apathy which contributed no small part to the feelings

432
00:39:26.04 --> 00:39:28.68
of the prisoner.

433
00:39:28.68 --> 00:39:34.08
At times, lightning decisions had to be made.

434
00:39:34.08 --> 00:39:37.08
Decisions with spelled life or death.

435
00:39:37.08 --> 00:39:44.04
The prisoner would have preferred to let fate make the choice for him.

436
00:39:44.04 --> 00:39:48.80
Some of the examples that he brings up in the book on that are, they'd get told, we need

437
00:39:48.80 --> 00:39:54.04
people to go to a different camp for rest.

438
00:39:54.04 --> 00:39:55.64
They had no idea.

439
00:39:55.64 --> 00:39:56.64
Sometimes it actually was.

440
00:39:56.64 --> 00:40:01.92
Sometimes it was some kind of actual medical facility.

441
00:40:01.92 --> 00:40:05.28
Sometimes it was just you're going to the gas chambers at another camp and they had no

442
00:40:05.28 --> 00:40:07.68
idea which one it was.

443
00:40:07.68 --> 00:40:12.28
They got into this mode of they were just going to externally just whatever was going

444
00:40:12.28 --> 00:40:13.28
to happen.

445
00:40:13.28 --> 00:40:20.36
They go beyond when they're trying to begin to get me off that list or I want to be on that

446
00:40:20.36 --> 00:40:24.20
list and they realize that they were messing with fate.

447
00:40:24.20 --> 00:40:31.96
They got into a mode of, I'm just going to let things happen and whatever happens happens.

448
00:40:31.96 --> 00:40:36.36
You get this feeling of apathy.

449
00:40:36.36 --> 00:40:42.36
You can just imagine how that, that having no control externally of what's happening, how

450
00:40:42.36 --> 00:40:43.76
that leads.

451
00:40:43.76 --> 00:40:48.12
Number one leads to this apathy of just I don't care what happens.

452
00:40:48.12 --> 00:40:53.48
But number two, how that can then sneak in and start to get control of your inner

453
00:40:53.48 --> 00:40:56.56
thoughts and your inner feelings where you just feel like you don't have control over

454
00:40:56.56 --> 00:40:58.68
anything in life and that's it.

455
00:40:58.68 --> 00:41:01.72
And here he talks about apathy some more.

456
00:41:01.72 --> 00:41:07.88
The prisoners apathy was also the result of other factors, hunger and lack of sleep contributed

457
00:41:07.88 --> 00:41:13.000
to it as they do in normal life also.

458
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.44
And to the general irritability which was another characteristic of the prisoner's mental

459
00:41:17.44 --> 00:41:19.20
state.

460
00:41:19.20 --> 00:41:23.04
The lack of sleep was partly due to the pestering of vermin which infested the terribly

461
00:41:23.04 --> 00:41:29.36
overcrowded huts because of the general lack of hygiene and sanitation.

462
00:41:29.36 --> 00:41:34.20
The fact that we had neither nicotine nor caffeine also contributed to the state of apathy

463
00:41:34.20 --> 00:41:37.12
and irritability.

464
00:41:37.12 --> 00:41:41.04
Besides these physical causes, there were mental ones.

465
00:41:41.04 --> 00:41:46.36
In the form of certain complexes, the majority of prisoners suffered from a kind of inferiority

466
00:41:46.36 --> 00:41:48.16
complex.

467
00:41:48.16 --> 00:41:53.76
We all had once been or had fancied ourselves to be somebody.

468
00:41:53.76 --> 00:42:00.04
Now we were treated like complete non-entities.

469
00:42:00.04 --> 00:42:05.32
The consciousness of one's inner value is anchored in higher, more spiritual things.

470
00:42:05.32 --> 00:42:08.24
It cannot be shaken by camp life.

471
00:42:08.24 --> 00:42:14.28
But how many free men load alone prisoners possess it?

472
00:42:14.28 --> 00:42:21.04
Without consciously thinking about it, the average prisoner felt himself utterly degraded.

473
00:42:21.04 --> 00:42:26.80
This became obvious when one observed the contrasts offered by the singular sociological

474
00:42:26.80 --> 00:42:28.52
structure of the camp.

475
00:42:28.52 --> 00:42:34.44
The more prominent prisoners, the capos, the cooks, the storekeepers and the camp policemen

476
00:42:34.44 --> 00:42:38.08
did not as a rule field degraded at all.

477
00:42:38.08 --> 00:42:44.04
Like the majority of prisoners, but on the contrary, they felt promoted.

478
00:42:44.04 --> 00:42:52.76
They even developed miniature delusions of grandeur.

479
00:42:52.76 --> 00:42:56.12
Clearly we can all take a lesson out of that one.

480
00:42:56.12 --> 00:43:01.000
That is, you know, you get put into a promotion position or you've got authority over

481
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
people.

482
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.76
Don't let that go to your head.

483
00:43:03.76 --> 00:43:10.60
Yeah, I guess that's a natural thing where they did this experiment test in the university

484
00:43:10.60 --> 00:43:11.60
whatever.

485
00:43:11.60 --> 00:43:15.60
Just from random students, one played the prisoner, one group played the guards and that

486
00:43:15.60 --> 00:43:16.60
happened.

487
00:43:16.60 --> 00:43:19.44
You know, like an actor, it's just an experiment.

488
00:43:19.44 --> 00:43:21.96
It's not real life, you know, it's still happened.

489
00:43:21.96 --> 00:43:26.08
Yeah, and it happened in real life, which I think is even more insane.

490
00:43:26.08 --> 00:43:28.52
See, even more insane.

491
00:43:28.52 --> 00:43:31.40
Yeah, and away, huh.

492
00:43:31.40 --> 00:43:39.08
But then again, how can we sit here in judge when if you're in that situation and you need

493
00:43:39.08 --> 00:43:43.64
to survive and you need to do the best to get you to survive in your family survive?

494
00:43:43.64 --> 00:43:47.12
And you have an opportunity, oh, are we going to say nope?

495
00:43:47.12 --> 00:43:48.12
Nope.

496
00:43:48.12 --> 00:43:52.92
I'm going to instead of doing this where I maybe can do something good in the long run.

497
00:43:52.92 --> 00:43:53.92
Nope.

498
00:43:53.92 --> 00:43:55.56
I'm not going to go across my values.

499
00:43:55.56 --> 00:43:57.60
I'm going to die in three days and that's it.

500
00:43:57.60 --> 00:43:58.60
Yeah.

501
00:43:58.60 --> 00:44:00.24
That's a hard decision to make.

502
00:44:00.24 --> 00:44:04.88
Yeah, I mean, it seems easy when you're sitting in the comfort of your home.

503
00:44:04.88 --> 00:44:09.60
Like, I wouldn't do that or, you know, and this is what I would have done or I wouldn't

504
00:44:09.60 --> 00:44:10.60
have done.

505
00:44:10.60 --> 00:44:16.88
But yeah, you know, I, I, I, I talked to people about again, it's I'm not going to compare

506
00:44:16.88 --> 00:44:21.88
anything to what we're talking about here, but in the military, for instance, a lot of

507
00:44:21.88 --> 00:44:27.80
times I had to make decisions to, to, to, you know, I got to do something that maybe

508
00:44:27.80 --> 00:44:32.52
I didn't fully agree with, but I knew in the long run, it was going to get me something

509
00:44:32.52 --> 00:44:36.32
that it was going to be beneficial to my team or to my platoon or whatever.

510
00:44:36.32 --> 00:44:37.32
Yeah.

511
00:44:37.32 --> 00:44:40.60
So you make those little adjustments and you got to suck it up and you do something that

512
00:44:40.60 --> 00:44:44.44
you might not want to do, but in the long run, it's going to be beneficial.

513
00:44:44.44 --> 00:44:45.44
Yeah.

514
00:44:45.44 --> 00:44:50.96
I mean, this, I, I don't even know if this is even a remotely close comparison.

515
00:44:50.96 --> 00:44:55.84
But what I am saying is this, you take a human being and you say, look, you can either

516
00:44:55.84 --> 00:45:00.48
step up and act a different way and be abusive to these people or you're going to be dead

517
00:45:00.48 --> 00:45:01.48
in three days.

518
00:45:01.48 --> 00:45:02.48
That's it.

519
00:45:02.48 --> 00:45:03.48
Those are your choices.

520
00:45:03.48 --> 00:45:04.48
Yeah.

521
00:45:04.48 --> 00:45:07.84
And it's not that hard to figure out that a lot of people are going to step up and say,

522
00:45:07.84 --> 00:45:11.44
cool, all of you, those people because I need to live, need to live.

523
00:45:11.44 --> 00:45:12.44
Yeah.

524
00:45:12.44 --> 00:45:13.44
My choices either death.

525
00:45:13.44 --> 00:45:14.44
Yeah.

526
00:45:14.44 --> 00:45:19.24
And by the way, maybe the, maybe the the best person in that group is going to say, you

527
00:45:19.24 --> 00:45:24.04
know what, I'm going to do this and I'm going to step up and when I abuse these people,

528
00:45:24.04 --> 00:45:26.72
I'm going to do a little bit less than someone else might.

529
00:45:26.72 --> 00:45:28.48
And therefore, I'm doing the best I can.

530
00:45:28.48 --> 00:45:29.48
Yeah.

531
00:45:29.48 --> 00:45:31.48
I mean, these are decisions.

532
00:45:31.48 --> 00:45:33.48
How do you even think about these decisions?

533
00:45:33.48 --> 00:45:34.48
Yeah.

534
00:45:34.48 --> 00:45:35.48
No, man.

535
00:45:35.48 --> 00:45:36.48
And you have to think about it.

536
00:45:36.48 --> 00:45:40.68
You have to understand, you have to understand what human nature is that there is a survival

537
00:45:40.68 --> 00:45:42.16
point for humans.

538
00:45:42.16 --> 00:45:46.48
You have an instinct to survive that very few people can overcome.

539
00:45:46.48 --> 00:45:48.84
Yeah.

540
00:45:48.84 --> 00:45:54.72
And I don't even, you know, again, how do you judge whether it's right to overcome it or not?

541
00:45:54.72 --> 00:45:55.72
When is it right?

542
00:45:55.72 --> 00:45:57.36
I mean, obviously, when is it right?

543
00:45:57.36 --> 00:45:58.36
We're sitting here.

544
00:45:58.36 --> 00:46:01.56
You say, hey, don't, you know, these guys, why would you kill yourself?

545
00:46:01.56 --> 00:46:05.36
Well, if you don't do these things, you're basically killing yourself.

546
00:46:05.36 --> 00:46:10.12
If you don't step up, if you don't say, okay, I'll work as a capo.

547
00:46:10.12 --> 00:46:11.60
If you don't do that, you're killing yourself.

548
00:46:11.60 --> 00:46:12.60
Right.

549
00:46:12.60 --> 00:46:13.60
Is that make it okay?

550
00:46:13.60 --> 00:46:14.60
Man.

551
00:46:14.60 --> 00:46:15.60
Yeah.

552
00:46:15.60 --> 00:46:16.60
It's brutal.

553
00:46:16.60 --> 00:46:19.88
It's like you got to figure out whether or not you're better off dead in the, even in the grand scheme

554
00:46:19.88 --> 00:46:20.88
of things.

555
00:46:20.88 --> 00:46:25.68
Like these, these people that they're going to kind of succumb to these positions or do all these

556
00:46:25.68 --> 00:46:31.44
low things to survive, so they can survive and you don't live on and all this stuff.

557
00:46:31.44 --> 00:46:35.52
So it's either that or am I better off dead overall.

558
00:46:35.52 --> 00:46:37.84
You know, like that's the decision you got to make.

559
00:46:37.84 --> 00:46:38.84
Tank.

560
00:46:38.84 --> 00:46:42.04
Who knows what you think, especially with all these conditions?

561
00:46:42.04 --> 00:46:43.04
Yeah.

562
00:46:43.04 --> 00:46:46.72
You know, the opposite of that was Dick Winners was talking about how he had, and I don't

563
00:46:46.72 --> 00:46:52.28
know if I talked about it on the podcast, but in the book conversations with Dick Winners,

564
00:46:52.28 --> 00:46:55.64
you go through a big section where he talks about some of the guys and his

565
00:46:55.64 --> 00:46:56.64
company.

566
00:46:56.64 --> 00:47:00.80
And he called him the killers and he actually went on and said, hey, you know, I don't

567
00:47:00.80 --> 00:47:04.92
want to call him killers because that's going to give the wrong impression.

568
00:47:04.92 --> 00:47:07.04
But these guys were my most aggressive guys.

569
00:47:07.04 --> 00:47:09.08
They were my best guys.

570
00:47:09.08 --> 00:47:12.20
And he said, they didn't make it past.

571
00:47:12.20 --> 00:47:13.72
You know, he said, most of them didn't make it.

572
00:47:13.72 --> 00:47:18.000
I forget which, which battle, but he said, most of them didn't make it past this certain

573
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.28
time because they were so aggressive.

574
00:47:20.28 --> 00:47:27.56
They were such good guys. They were so brave that they didn't make it.

575
00:47:27.56 --> 00:47:31.68
And this is sort of the opposite where you have the people that are brave.

576
00:47:31.68 --> 00:47:34.96
I guess no, it's the same in that people that are brave and going to hold their values.

577
00:47:34.96 --> 00:47:35.96
They're going to die.

578
00:47:35.96 --> 00:47:36.96
Right.

579
00:47:36.96 --> 00:47:42.72
And if you think about somebody that's cowardly in combat, that says, oh, you know, what,

580
00:47:42.72 --> 00:47:43.88
you know, echo you go first.

581
00:47:43.88 --> 00:47:47.76
I'm going to sit over here behind this, you know, covered position.

582
00:47:47.76 --> 00:47:48.76
Yeah.

583
00:47:48.76 --> 00:47:53.76
And it's a micro example of what we're talking about here.

584
00:47:53.76 --> 00:47:54.76
Yeah.

585
00:47:54.76 --> 00:47:55.76
Yeah.

586
00:47:55.76 --> 00:48:01.48
And this, this, given the book in what we're talking about, it might come off as borderline

587
00:48:01.48 --> 00:48:04.28
insulting, if not full fledged insulting.

588
00:48:04.28 --> 00:48:06.28
But you ever watched this show survivor?

589
00:48:06.28 --> 00:48:09.28
I, I, I, I was the first one when it was kind of a thing.

590
00:48:09.28 --> 00:48:10.28
Yeah.

591
00:48:10.28 --> 00:48:12.28
And it was an interesting psychology happening.

592
00:48:12.28 --> 00:48:13.28
Yeah.

593
00:48:13.28 --> 00:48:15.52
And that's like a lot of this Rudy Bosch was on it.

594
00:48:15.52 --> 00:48:18.32
You know, this, see, retired seal map.

595
00:48:18.32 --> 00:48:19.32
Yeah.

596
00:48:19.32 --> 00:48:21.32
And it's like, you know, everyone kind of knew in the seal teams.

597
00:48:21.32 --> 00:48:22.32
Okay.

598
00:48:22.32 --> 00:48:23.32
Yeah.

599
00:48:23.32 --> 00:48:27.52
So, especially when you're going to say is that the, the people that are not good human

600
00:48:27.52 --> 00:48:29.32
beings are the ones that went a lot.

601
00:48:29.32 --> 00:48:33.64
Well, they get far put it that way because they have this weird mechanism at the end,

602
00:48:33.64 --> 00:48:38.28
where the last, you know, few people who get voted off, they become this sort of a jury.

603
00:48:38.28 --> 00:48:41.92
So it's like if you went through the whole game, screwing people over, the jury's going

604
00:48:41.92 --> 00:48:43.16
to get you kind of thing.

605
00:48:43.16 --> 00:48:44.16
So it's a, yeah.

606
00:48:44.16 --> 00:48:48.04
And this is just how the show just sorted itself out over time.

607
00:48:48.04 --> 00:48:49.60
But the first ones didn't have any jury, right?

608
00:48:49.60 --> 00:48:50.60
I don't, I don't know.

609
00:48:50.60 --> 00:48:51.60
I don't know.

610
00:48:51.60 --> 00:48:52.60
I don't know.

611
00:48:52.60 --> 00:48:57.12
I'm going to go ahead and say, I'm almost positive they didn't because Rudy had his

612
00:48:57.12 --> 00:49:01.92
hand on some log and they had to keep it there for like X and for a whole time.

613
00:49:01.92 --> 00:49:05.68
And one person, you know, he actually, he like fought us on something else and took his

614
00:49:05.68 --> 00:49:06.68
hand off and then he was out.

615
00:49:06.68 --> 00:49:07.68
That was it.

616
00:49:07.68 --> 00:49:08.68
Okay.

617
00:49:08.68 --> 00:49:10.68
But yeah, there's absolute comparison there.

618
00:49:10.68 --> 00:49:17.48
There's an absolute comparison to, you know, if you're willing to be a snake, right,

619
00:49:17.48 --> 00:49:20.24
you can, and you can, you can win the game.

620
00:49:20.24 --> 00:49:22.40
And I've talked about that to in promotion.

621
00:49:22.40 --> 00:49:23.80
People getting promoted.

622
00:49:23.80 --> 00:49:27.44
And if you're willing to be a snake, you can get promoted.

623
00:49:27.44 --> 00:49:32.92
But the thing that I will say in a work environment is that that snake might get one

624
00:49:32.92 --> 00:49:33.92
promotion.

625
00:49:33.92 --> 00:49:35.60
They might get two promotions.

626
00:49:35.60 --> 00:49:36.92
They're not going to go to the distance.

627
00:49:36.92 --> 00:49:43.48
And if you hold the line on doing what's correct, then you might miss that first

628
00:49:43.48 --> 00:49:44.48
promotion.

629
00:49:44.48 --> 00:49:45.92
You might even miss that second promotion.

630
00:49:45.92 --> 00:49:50.04
And eventually, if you're on the right path, you will get the recognition and you will

631
00:49:50.04 --> 00:49:51.28
win in the long run.

632
00:49:51.28 --> 00:49:52.60
You've got to be patient though.

633
00:49:52.60 --> 00:49:53.60
Yeah.

634
00:49:53.60 --> 00:49:54.60
Yeah.

635
00:49:54.60 --> 00:49:58.08
I mean, obviously in your job, it's not life or death.

636
00:49:58.08 --> 00:50:01.40
You know, death isn't so close that, you know, one slip up your death.

637
00:50:01.40 --> 00:50:02.40
You're dead.

638
00:50:02.40 --> 00:50:06.24
So that's, you know, obviously the dynamics are different in work in that way.

639
00:50:06.24 --> 00:50:08.16
But otherwise, I think so.

640
00:50:08.16 --> 00:50:12.44
And survivor, there's also that other thing that kind of, what they talked about where or

641
00:50:12.44 --> 00:50:14.88
what you're just talking about is.

642
00:50:14.88 --> 00:50:19.76
If you, it's kind of, in a matter of speaking, playing at safe where you're just hiding

643
00:50:19.76 --> 00:50:25.28
under the wing, you might attach yourself to someone or you'll avoid any kind of, you

644
00:50:25.28 --> 00:50:32.04
know, risky, persuasion, and so in survivor, you can make it far like that as well.

645
00:50:32.04 --> 00:50:34.28
And nowadays, everyone knows about those things.

646
00:50:34.28 --> 00:50:35.64
Like, oh, you backstabbed everyone.

647
00:50:35.64 --> 00:50:40.08
Or you just hid behind this guy because he's strong by the same time, just like how you're

648
00:50:40.08 --> 00:50:44.44
saying, if you're brave or you're going to stick to your morals and be honest with everyone,

649
00:50:44.44 --> 00:50:45.92
you'll get voted off real quick.

650
00:50:45.92 --> 00:50:50.52
Even if you're really good at, you know, the challenges, but don't even really good leaders

651
00:50:50.52 --> 00:50:51.52
get voted.

652
00:50:51.52 --> 00:50:53.20
Like if someone just does a dynamic, they go to the office.

653
00:50:53.20 --> 00:50:54.20
That would be right.

654
00:50:54.20 --> 00:50:55.20
Yeah, yeah, see you later.

655
00:50:55.20 --> 00:50:57.20
Too much of a threat to everybody else.

656
00:50:57.20 --> 00:51:00.16
And actually what you're talking about going through seal training, I would hear it.

657
00:51:00.16 --> 00:51:02.52
And it was, I didn't hear it when I went through.

658
00:51:02.52 --> 00:51:05.20
But I heard it later, this idea of the gray man.

659
00:51:05.20 --> 00:51:08.96
And I think we might have actually answered a question on the podcast about that was going

660
00:51:08.96 --> 00:51:11.80
through training and just being a gray man, meaning just don't stand out.

661
00:51:11.80 --> 00:51:12.80
Right.

662
00:51:12.80 --> 00:51:13.80
That's the other.

663
00:51:13.80 --> 00:51:15.56
And you'll be good to go.

664
00:51:15.56 --> 00:51:18.32
And that's a strategy.

665
00:51:18.32 --> 00:51:19.32
That's a strategy.

666
00:51:19.32 --> 00:51:20.32
Right.

667
00:51:20.32 --> 00:51:24.68
And the seal team is a strategy going through buds through seal training, the initial seal

668
00:51:24.68 --> 00:51:25.68
training course.

669
00:51:25.68 --> 00:51:28.40
Because the many you stand out, people start knowing who you are.

670
00:51:28.40 --> 00:51:31.44
And now you got instructors looking at you and the more they watch you, the more they can

671
00:51:31.44 --> 00:51:35.64
see, maybe you're making some mistakes or maybe you're not doing everything right or maybe

672
00:51:35.64 --> 00:51:36.64
you're not.

673
00:51:36.64 --> 00:51:38.72
And so it's better just to be that guy in the middle.

674
00:51:38.72 --> 00:51:41.84
I was the guy in the middle, not because I wanted to be.

675
00:51:41.84 --> 00:51:46.04
Because I was not, you know, the fastest runner I wasn't the best runner.

676
00:51:46.04 --> 00:51:48.08
What you don't want to be is the guy on the tail end.

677
00:51:48.08 --> 00:51:49.08
Right.

678
00:51:49.08 --> 00:51:52.48
And it's weird because I put so many guys not through the basic seal training, but through

679
00:51:52.48 --> 00:51:54.40
the advanced seal training.

680
00:51:54.40 --> 00:51:57.36
And the guys that I remember, there's two types of guys that I remember, the guys that

681
00:51:57.36 --> 00:51:59.36
were awesome and the guys that were horrible.

682
00:51:59.36 --> 00:52:02.96
And the guys in the middle, all the gray guys, I know them when I see them, but a lot

683
00:52:02.96 --> 00:52:04.32
of times I know 100%.

684
00:52:04.32 --> 00:52:06.28
I might not know their name.

685
00:52:06.28 --> 00:52:10.68
Whereas some of the pipeters, the young pipeters, some E5 pipeter that was just getting

686
00:52:10.68 --> 00:52:11.68
after it.

687
00:52:11.68 --> 00:52:13.96
I always remember those guys names because they would take control of everything.

688
00:52:13.96 --> 00:52:14.96
And they'd stand out.

689
00:52:14.96 --> 00:52:18.36
And then the other guys you remember, a guy that are totally jacked up.

690
00:52:18.36 --> 00:52:23.84
So that idea of being a gray man, it seems like a good policy to have in the concentration

691
00:52:23.84 --> 00:52:24.84
cap.

692
00:52:24.84 --> 00:52:25.84
Look, I just don't want to stand out.

693
00:52:25.84 --> 00:52:26.84
I don't want to have a limp.

694
00:52:26.84 --> 00:52:31.44
I don't want to, you know, come across as I just want to fit in in the gray man.

695
00:52:31.44 --> 00:52:35.04
Unless you're going to go the distance, right?

696
00:52:35.04 --> 00:52:39.76
Which is, and that's a horrible way of saying, I'm going to stand out by saying, hey,

697
00:52:39.76 --> 00:52:42.52
I can whip these prisoners into shape.

698
00:52:42.52 --> 00:52:45.64
That's going and raising your hand and saying, I'll be a capo.

699
00:52:45.64 --> 00:52:50.20
I'm going to step up and what you're risking there is we don't know where this war is

700
00:52:50.20 --> 00:52:53.64
going to end and where you're going to be at the end of this thing.

701
00:52:53.64 --> 00:52:55.68
And I read some stories about that.

702
00:52:55.68 --> 00:52:57.28
The war didn't.

703
00:52:57.28 --> 00:52:59.52
And they did liberate these camps.

704
00:52:59.52 --> 00:53:00.68
And it didn't work out.

705
00:53:00.68 --> 00:53:04.16
Good for the capos.

706
00:53:04.16 --> 00:53:06.52
So there's the same thing.

707
00:53:06.52 --> 00:53:11.96
You might have done all right, getting your promotion the first couple of times, but eventually

708
00:53:11.96 --> 00:53:12.96
it comes around.

709
00:53:12.96 --> 00:53:15.16
Yeah, exactly right.

710
00:53:15.16 --> 00:53:17.56
You know, hardly flanagan was talking about karma.

711
00:53:17.56 --> 00:53:20.08
And I don't know how much reality there is to that.

712
00:53:20.08 --> 00:53:24.12
But there's the reality of you reap what you sow.

713
00:53:24.12 --> 00:53:25.12
Yeah.

714
00:53:25.12 --> 00:53:29.80
And if you treat people, if you take advantage of your position, if you maneuver and

715
00:53:29.80 --> 00:53:32.76
screw people over to get ahead of them, they'll remember that.

716
00:53:32.76 --> 00:53:33.76
Yeah.

717
00:53:33.76 --> 00:53:34.76
They'll remember that.

718
00:53:34.76 --> 00:53:35.76
Yeah.

719
00:53:35.76 --> 00:53:36.76
And karma with you.

720
00:53:36.76 --> 00:53:39.000
And it's never worth it, by the way.

721
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
It's almost never worth it.

722
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.24
I mean, could you possibly come up with some scenario where, you know, I did this to get

723
00:53:47.24 --> 00:53:48.24
a promotion.

724
00:53:48.24 --> 00:53:49.84
So that I could take care of you and everyone else.

725
00:53:49.84 --> 00:53:50.84
You could come up with this.

726
00:53:50.84 --> 00:53:52.96
Yeah, but it's very, very rare.

727
00:53:52.96 --> 00:53:57.12
And my gut feeling was always like it's not worth it.

728
00:53:57.12 --> 00:54:03.36
It's not worth it to do those little maneuvers and try and better your position on other

729
00:54:03.36 --> 00:54:04.80
people's backs.

730
00:54:04.80 --> 00:54:05.80
Yeah.

731
00:54:05.80 --> 00:54:06.80
We're screwing someone over in.

732
00:54:06.80 --> 00:54:07.80
Because you've got to live with that too.

733
00:54:07.80 --> 00:54:11.24
I mean, unless you're like a sociopath or something like that, you have to live with

734
00:54:11.24 --> 00:54:12.24
that.

735
00:54:12.24 --> 00:54:14.60
And man, yeah.

736
00:54:14.60 --> 00:54:17.16
And even at the time, it seems like, oh, I could live with that.

737
00:54:17.16 --> 00:54:18.16
Cause, oh, look at what?

738
00:54:18.16 --> 00:54:21.28
You're actually, you're actually taking a higher road than me.

739
00:54:21.28 --> 00:54:23.44
Because you're saying you personally have to live with it.

740
00:54:23.44 --> 00:54:26.64
And that's definitely, I'm saying beyond that, even if you're a person that can live with

741
00:54:26.64 --> 00:54:29.12
it, you're still going to pay in a long run.

742
00:54:29.12 --> 00:54:31.64
Even if you look yourself in the mirror, but like, I don't care, I got promoted.

743
00:54:31.64 --> 00:54:32.64
It's good.

744
00:54:32.64 --> 00:54:33.64
That's, that's, okay.

745
00:54:33.64 --> 00:54:34.64
So you can live with that.

746
00:54:34.64 --> 00:54:35.64
That's cool.

747
00:54:35.64 --> 00:54:38.60
But guess what, there's something else you're going to, that's going to come back around.

748
00:54:38.60 --> 00:54:43.16
And that is one of those other people that you stepped on their back is going to invent

749
00:54:43.16 --> 00:54:44.16
something new at work.

750
00:54:44.16 --> 00:54:46.44
And he's going to take over the division and you're going to pay.

751
00:54:46.44 --> 00:54:48.88
Not to mention the 10 people who watched it happen.

752
00:54:48.88 --> 00:54:49.88
Yeah.

753
00:54:49.88 --> 00:54:50.88
You know, yeah.

754
00:54:50.88 --> 00:54:51.88
You're just making enemies.

755
00:54:51.88 --> 00:54:52.88
Yeah.

756
00:54:52.88 --> 00:54:53.88
enemies.

757
00:54:53.88 --> 00:54:55.88
And that's really what Karma is for.

758
00:54:55.88 --> 00:54:59.52
I mean, karma could be this mystical thing that personally watches you and has this

759
00:54:59.52 --> 00:55:00.52
judgment system.

760
00:55:00.52 --> 00:55:02.04
But you can just be real.

761
00:55:02.04 --> 00:55:03.04
Just real life.

762
00:55:03.04 --> 00:55:05.56
So walk up to, you know, even mean you're even.

763
00:55:05.56 --> 00:55:06.56
We don't know each other.

764
00:55:06.56 --> 00:55:08.88
I don't have any bad or good feelings towards you.

765
00:55:08.88 --> 00:55:10.72
And I come and I slap you.

766
00:55:10.72 --> 00:55:12.28
I created a deficit now.

767
00:55:12.28 --> 00:55:13.28
Now you're in 10.

768
00:55:13.28 --> 00:55:14.28
You're right.

769
00:55:14.28 --> 00:55:15.56
Big deficit.

770
00:55:15.56 --> 00:55:16.56
Yeah.

771
00:55:16.56 --> 00:55:21.48
So you're intention, whether you do it or not, you're, what you, you're compelled

772
00:55:21.48 --> 00:55:23.20
to slap me back if not more.

773
00:55:23.20 --> 00:55:24.20
Usually more.

774
00:55:24.20 --> 00:55:25.20
Yeah.

775
00:55:25.20 --> 00:55:26.80
Because, you know, so that's kind of really what it is.

776
00:55:26.80 --> 00:55:28.80
I mean, really in a small teeny tiny nutshell.

777
00:55:28.80 --> 00:55:29.80
Yeah.

778
00:55:29.80 --> 00:55:32.24
I go out and start acting mad to everyone.

779
00:55:32.24 --> 00:55:34.000
They're not going to be like, oh, I love you.

780
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.40
I mean, they might be, you know, intellectual or, you know, they might be

781
00:55:37.40 --> 00:55:38.72
able to think about it.

782
00:55:38.72 --> 00:55:42.60
But their natural compulsion will be to be mad at you back.

783
00:55:42.60 --> 00:55:47.96
And this, you know, the podcast, human nature, talking about human nature.

784
00:55:47.96 --> 00:55:52.60
And I always say that war reveals human nature more clearly than anything else.

785
00:55:52.60 --> 00:55:55.16
Because it's so much pressure on the people.

786
00:55:55.16 --> 00:55:58.88
Obviously a concentration camp, it's revealing human nature.

787
00:55:58.88 --> 00:56:00.92
And that's exactly what we're talking about.

788
00:56:00.92 --> 00:56:07.68
And it reveals itself in crystal clarity on a massive scale in terms of being able to

789
00:56:07.68 --> 00:56:09.64
see it in a concentration camp.

790
00:56:09.64 --> 00:56:13.16
And you see it reveal itself on a TV show called survivor.

791
00:56:13.16 --> 00:56:16.92
And you see it reveal itself in the work environment.

792
00:56:16.92 --> 00:56:22.44
And what I'm saying is, from all that, what you want to do is you want to make sure that

793
00:56:22.44 --> 00:56:26.12
when you get put into a position of authority, you don't abuse it.

794
00:56:26.12 --> 00:56:27.68
That's what I'm saying.

795
00:56:27.68 --> 00:56:33.12
You don't want to abuse it. You want to treat people with respect no matter what.

796
00:56:33.12 --> 00:56:38.24
And you don't want to step on people's backs to get ahead because ultimately it's not

797
00:56:38.24 --> 00:56:39.60
going to pay off.

798
00:56:39.60 --> 00:56:40.84
It really isn't.

799
00:56:40.84 --> 00:56:41.84
Yeah.

800
00:56:41.84 --> 00:56:43.24
You're only going to fool.

801
00:56:43.24 --> 00:56:47.04
Like that leader that you, that you fooled and thinking that you are a great guy.

802
00:56:47.04 --> 00:56:49.16
That's only going to last for so long.

803
00:56:49.16 --> 00:56:53.20
And eventually you're going to get found out.

804
00:56:53.20 --> 00:57:01.24
Now, all right, let's get back into the book here.

805
00:57:01.24 --> 00:57:07.28
The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action.

806
00:57:07.28 --> 00:57:09.72
And this is we've talked about the capitals and he's going to talk about some of the

807
00:57:09.72 --> 00:57:14.52
more heroic people and some of those actions very briefly.

808
00:57:14.52 --> 00:57:20.16
And he says because it's the reason there's very briefly because there wasn't a lot of them.

809
00:57:20.16 --> 00:57:23.92
The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action.

810
00:57:23.92 --> 00:57:30.48
There were enough examples often of a heroic nature which proved that apathy could be overcome

811
00:57:30.48 --> 00:57:34.40
irritability, irritability suppressed.

812
00:57:34.40 --> 00:57:39.20
Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom.

813
00:57:39.20 --> 00:57:47.76
Of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress.

814
00:57:47.76 --> 00:57:54.76
We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through huts, comforting

815
00:57:54.76 --> 00:57:59.76
others, giving away their last piece of bread.

816
00:57:59.76 --> 00:58:06.20
They may have been few and number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken

817
00:58:06.20 --> 00:58:09.64
from a man but one thing.

818
00:58:09.64 --> 00:58:18.96
The last of the human freedoms to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances

819
00:58:18.96 --> 00:58:22.12
to choose one's own way.

820
00:58:22.12 --> 00:58:23.44
And there it is.

821
00:58:23.44 --> 00:58:26.36
I mean that is it.

822
00:58:26.36 --> 00:58:27.84
That is it.

823
00:58:27.84 --> 00:58:36.000
This idea and captain plumb talked about it as well and captain plumb had a quote from Stockdale.

824
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.24
We got to explore this and I've got a bunch of stockdale books and we will get to some

825
00:58:40.24 --> 00:58:41.24
stockdale books.

826
00:58:41.24 --> 00:58:49.52
Who is the senior guy in the Hanau Hillton and he's a fighter pilot philosopher guy, brilliant

827
00:58:49.52 --> 00:58:50.72
guy in the hero.

828
00:58:50.72 --> 00:58:56.88
One was awarded the Medal of Honor and one of the things that Captain Plumb was talking

829
00:58:56.88 --> 00:59:02.84
to us about is Captain Plumb said that they got word from Stockdale and I'm going to misquote

830
00:59:02.84 --> 00:59:04.52
it by I'm going to do my best.

831
00:59:04.52 --> 00:59:10.16
It was just because we're in a prison camp doesn't mean we have to be on defense.

832
00:59:10.16 --> 00:59:11.76
We're going to be on offense.

833
00:59:11.76 --> 00:59:17.24
In a prison camp, that's just a completely different attitude.

834
00:59:17.24 --> 00:59:18.60
It's choosing the attitude.

835
00:59:18.60 --> 00:59:23.60
We're not going to sit here and be abused and be put down.

836
00:59:23.60 --> 00:59:25.12
We're going to step up.

837
00:59:25.12 --> 00:59:27.88
We're going to go on offense and they did.

838
00:59:27.88 --> 00:59:28.88
They did hunger strikes.

839
00:59:28.88 --> 00:59:29.88
They passed word around.

840
00:59:29.88 --> 00:59:31.52
They wouldn't stand up when people entered.

841
00:59:31.52 --> 00:59:35.52
They did these things.

842
00:59:35.52 --> 00:59:38.52
They went on offense.

843
00:59:38.52 --> 00:59:44.96
Human freedom to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.

844
00:59:44.96 --> 00:59:47.04
We always have that choice.

845
00:59:47.04 --> 00:59:55.16
No matter what the circumstances are that it's around you, always have that choice.

846
00:59:55.16 --> 00:59:59.20
Back to the book and there will always choices to make.

847
00:59:59.20 --> 01:00:03.32
Every day, every hour offered the opportunity to make a decision.

848
01:00:03.32 --> 01:00:09.40
A decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which

849
01:00:09.40 --> 01:00:15.92
threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom.

850
01:00:15.92 --> 01:00:21.76
Which determined whether or not you would become the plaything of circumstance.

851
01:00:21.76 --> 01:00:28.76
Conceying freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of the typical inmate.

852
01:00:28.76 --> 01:00:36.16
Again, there it is.

853
01:00:36.16 --> 01:00:42.72
You're in a concentration camp, doomed, doomed.

854
01:00:42.72 --> 01:00:48.72
And yet you can hang on to that last bastion of freedom in your soul.

855
01:00:48.72 --> 01:00:57.60
To not let them win and not let them own that.

856
01:00:57.60 --> 01:01:01.20
Back to the book, seen from this point of view the mental reactions of the inmates of

857
01:01:01.20 --> 01:01:06.08
a concentration camp must seem more to us than the mere expression of certain physical

858
01:01:06.08 --> 01:01:09.52
and sociological conditions.

859
01:01:09.52 --> 01:01:14.48
Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food and various mental stresses

860
01:01:14.48 --> 01:01:20.80
may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis,

861
01:01:20.80 --> 01:01:27.68
it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of inner

862
01:01:27.68 --> 01:01:36.80
decision and not the result of camp influences alone.

863
01:01:36.80 --> 01:01:40.16
Think about that.

864
01:01:40.16 --> 01:01:46.24
The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision.

865
01:01:46.24 --> 01:01:49.52
Not the result of the circumstances here and that doesn't matter what kind of person you

866
01:01:49.52 --> 01:01:50.88
become.

867
01:01:50.88 --> 01:01:58.68
What matters is the decisions that you make.

868
01:01:58.68 --> 01:02:02.04
Unbelievable.

869
01:02:02.04 --> 01:02:09.20
Back to the book, fundamentally, therefore any man can, even under such circumstances, decide

870
01:02:09.20 --> 01:02:13.28
what shall become of him mentally and spiritually.

871
01:02:13.28 --> 01:02:14.88
Okay, physically, you can have that one.

872
01:02:14.88 --> 01:02:26.000
Can't control that all the time, but mentally and spiritually, I get to decide what I'm going to be.

873
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:33.12
He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp.

874
01:02:33.12 --> 01:02:43.84
Thus the Fsky said, once there is only one thing that I dread not to be worthy of my sufferings.

875
01:02:43.84 --> 01:02:48.64
These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs

876
01:02:48.64 --> 01:02:56.24
who's behavior in camp, who's suffering and death bore witness to the fact that the last

877
01:02:56.24 --> 01:03:01.92
inner freedom cannot be lost.

878
01:03:01.92 --> 01:03:07.20
It can be said that they will worthy of their sufferings.

879
01:03:07.20 --> 01:03:14.24
The way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement.

880
01:03:14.24 --> 01:03:22.36
It is this spiritual freedom which cannot be taken away that makes life meaningful and

881
01:03:22.36 --> 01:03:28.04
purposeful.

882
01:03:28.04 --> 01:03:34.000
The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which

883
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.72
he takes up his cross gives him ample opportunity, even under the most difficult circumstances

884
01:03:40.72 --> 01:03:44.96
to add a deeper meaning to his life.

885
01:03:44.96 --> 01:03:53.28
It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish, or in the bitter fight for self-preservation,

886
01:03:53.28 --> 01:03:59.000
he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal.

887
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.68
Heurlies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forego the opportunities of

888
01:04:04.68 --> 01:04:12.96
attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him.

889
01:04:12.96 --> 01:04:18.52
And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.

890
01:04:18.52 --> 01:04:26.48
So think about that, when you get faced with this ultimate challenge, brutal challenge,

891
01:04:26.48 --> 01:04:34.24
when life is just about to crush you, that's when you have the biggest opportunity to

892
01:04:34.24 --> 01:04:38.04
prove who you are.

893
01:04:38.04 --> 01:04:47.12
Speaking of unworthy topics, but this is something I, when I was, when I first got to see

894
01:04:47.12 --> 01:04:52.36
what was at Silti-Mond, I ran a communications class.

895
01:04:52.36 --> 01:04:56.20
When I ran the class, I was super hard.

896
01:04:56.20 --> 01:04:57.84
I know it comes as a big shocker.

897
01:04:57.84 --> 01:05:02.04
But we would test, test, test on all these different subjects.

898
01:05:02.04 --> 01:05:09.20
What radio, what frequency you ran with, what all these different subjects.

899
01:05:09.20 --> 01:05:13.32
I would say the guys, hey, tomorrow we got another test, another opportunity for you to

900
01:05:13.32 --> 01:05:15.92
prove yourself.

901
01:05:15.92 --> 01:05:17.48
That's the way I looked at it.

902
01:05:17.48 --> 01:05:18.80
They didn't always look at it the same way.

903
01:05:18.80 --> 01:05:21.52
But that's exactly what he's saying here.

904
01:05:21.52 --> 01:05:28.32
When you have these brutal circumstances that you face, that's your opportunity.

905
01:05:28.32 --> 01:05:31.16
And if you think about all heroic tales, right?

906
01:05:31.16 --> 01:05:35.28
There's no heroic tales where the hero doesn't face any challenges.

907
01:05:35.28 --> 01:05:39.88
And as a matter of fact, the worst challenge is that he faces the more of a hero he becomes.

908
01:05:39.88 --> 01:05:42.68
If he rises to the occasion, if he doesn't rise to the occasion, guess what?

909
01:05:42.68 --> 01:05:43.68
We don't hear about it.

910
01:05:43.68 --> 01:05:47.80
Not a hero.

911
01:05:47.80 --> 01:05:52.92
In fact, let's say you're considered a hero.

912
01:05:52.92 --> 01:06:00.000
And then this big chance to prove yourself comes about and you fail or you don't step up,

913
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.56
you're kind of like this big failure in a way.

914
01:06:02.56 --> 01:06:04.96
Even though you've been a hero the whole time.

915
01:06:04.96 --> 01:06:07.56
Yeah, I would say that's true.

916
01:06:07.56 --> 01:06:12.92
Although if you do something heroic enough, people are like good with it.

917
01:06:12.92 --> 01:06:13.76
I think.

918
01:06:13.76 --> 01:06:17.56
If they're significant enough, it's kind of the same thing.

919
01:06:17.56 --> 01:06:24.76
I mean, the bottom line is you face these challenges and you get challenged to have this attitude

920
01:06:24.76 --> 01:06:30.16
of basically good opportunity to solve the problems.

921
01:06:30.16 --> 01:06:32.44
Oh, big challenge, cool opportunity.

922
01:06:32.44 --> 01:06:33.44
Good.

923
01:06:33.44 --> 01:06:37.24
Yes, like those guys who, they start a business, the business is like,

924
01:06:37.24 --> 01:06:42.60
grows and then it just massively fails because of some mistake or I don't know something.

925
01:06:42.60 --> 01:06:44.64
Or the kind of out in a whatever.

926
01:06:44.64 --> 01:06:49.20
And then they reach, rock bottom and they build themselves back up and then it's this massive

927
01:06:49.20 --> 01:06:50.20
success.

928
01:06:50.20 --> 01:06:52.20
That's such an impressive story.

929
01:06:52.20 --> 01:06:56.08
Yeah, you know, that's much better than hey, I went to this school.

930
01:06:56.08 --> 01:06:57.08
I graduated.

931
01:06:57.08 --> 01:06:58.56
I worked this job.

932
01:06:58.56 --> 01:06:59.56
I made a bunch of money.

933
01:06:59.56 --> 01:07:00.56
Yeah.

934
01:07:00.56 --> 01:07:01.56
Everyone goes on cool.

935
01:07:01.56 --> 01:07:02.56
Right?

936
01:07:02.56 --> 01:07:03.56
Cool.

937
01:07:03.56 --> 01:07:04.56
Yeah, cool.

938
01:07:04.56 --> 01:07:05.56
They want to hear the struggle.

939
01:07:05.56 --> 01:07:07.56
They want to see that you were challenged.

940
01:07:07.56 --> 01:07:08.56
Yep.

941
01:07:08.56 --> 01:07:17.52
Back to the book, everywhere man is confronted with fate, with the chance of achieving

942
01:07:17.52 --> 01:07:19.84
something through his own suffering.

943
01:07:19.84 --> 01:07:21.64
God, think about that.

944
01:07:21.64 --> 01:07:29.56
The suffering that you're going through is an a chance to achieve something through your

945
01:07:29.56 --> 01:07:30.72
suffering.

946
01:07:30.72 --> 01:07:32.000
That's an incredible thought.

947
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Yeah.

948
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.52
That's an incredible thought.

949
01:07:36.52 --> 01:07:43.24
Now, this next part is something that I get asked about on a fairly regular basis.

950
01:07:43.24 --> 01:07:50.84
Back to the book, take the fate of the sick, especially those who are incurable.

951
01:07:50.84 --> 01:07:55.24
I once read a letter written by young invalid in which he told a friend that he had just

952
01:07:55.24 --> 01:07:57.76
found out he would not live for long.

953
01:07:57.76 --> 01:08:00.76
That even an operation would be of no help.

954
01:08:00.76 --> 01:08:05.40
He wrote further that he remembered a film he had seen in which a man was portrayed

955
01:08:05.40 --> 01:08:11.32
who waited for death and encouraged and dignified way.

956
01:08:11.32 --> 01:08:13.52
The boy had a thought.

957
01:08:13.52 --> 01:08:18.56
The boy had thought it had great accomplishment to meet death so well.

958
01:08:18.56 --> 01:08:25.92
Now he wrote, fate was offering him a similar chance.

959
01:08:25.92 --> 01:08:26.92
Yeah.

960
01:08:26.92 --> 01:08:35.36
I mean, there's, there's, you know, diseases, terminal diseases.

961
01:08:35.36 --> 01:08:37.56
And that's it.

962
01:08:37.56 --> 01:08:39.44
And then what do you do?

963
01:08:39.44 --> 01:08:45.52
Well, I think you have to choose the best possible attitude you can.

964
01:08:45.52 --> 01:08:49.44
And again, I've never been in that situation, obviously.

965
01:08:49.44 --> 01:09:00.000
But that statement seems to be the best possible attitude to take.

966
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.68
Again, that's when we see people doing something heroic.

967
01:09:04.68 --> 01:09:05.68
That's what we see.

968
01:09:05.68 --> 01:09:10.28
I know it's funny some of those when we were doing a lot of the Native Americans on

969
01:09:10.28 --> 01:09:11.28
the podcast.

970
01:09:11.28 --> 01:09:12.48
They all had that attitude.

971
01:09:12.48 --> 01:09:16.12
When you go to face death, hold your head high.

972
01:09:16.12 --> 01:09:19.24
Be afraid of it.

973
01:09:19.24 --> 01:09:24.04
And that's really, like you said, it's an easier sitting here in the recording studio.

974
01:09:24.04 --> 01:09:29.96
And of course, easy for me to sit here and say that.

975
01:09:29.96 --> 01:09:30.96
But that's a hard one.

976
01:09:30.96 --> 01:09:39.24
You know, the other day on the Jill Rogan podcast, Everlast was on there.

977
01:09:39.24 --> 01:09:45.28
And Jill Rogan, you know, Everlast was saying, hey, you know, I'm not in good shape right

978
01:09:45.28 --> 01:09:46.28
now.

979
01:09:46.28 --> 01:09:47.52
I wish I could better shape, but I have, you know, bad.

980
01:09:47.52 --> 01:09:49.24
I think he's got a back injury.

981
01:09:49.24 --> 01:09:53.72
And he's got this and he's got a daughter that's got some kind of illness, bad illness.

982
01:09:53.72 --> 01:09:57.40
And Joe put on the good video that you made.

983
01:09:57.40 --> 01:10:01.96
And you know, Everlast, when he got done, Everlast was like, hey, that's cool.

984
01:10:01.96 --> 01:10:02.96
That's inspirational.

985
01:10:02.96 --> 01:10:04.60
But how does that help me with my sick daughter?

986
01:10:04.60 --> 01:10:05.60
Yeah.

987
01:10:05.60 --> 01:10:06.60
What's good about that?

988
01:10:06.60 --> 01:10:07.60
You know?

989
01:10:07.60 --> 01:10:14.32
And I wish I could have jumped through and talked to him because this much I will say, when

990
01:10:14.32 --> 01:10:20.20
you got a bad situation like that, I'm telling you right now, it could be worse.

991
01:10:20.20 --> 01:10:23.000
Absolutely a hundred percent.

992
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
And the fact that he's talking about his daughter and how she's sick and how he has

993
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.08
to spend so much time with her to take care of her, well, well, that's what I'm saying.

994
01:10:30.08 --> 01:10:31.08
Yeah.

995
01:10:31.08 --> 01:10:33.84
Be thankful that you're in a position in life where you can spend time with her.

996
01:10:33.84 --> 01:10:37.52
Be thankful that she's in a condition where she can spend time with you.

997
01:10:37.52 --> 01:10:38.52
Yeah.

998
01:10:38.52 --> 01:10:41.44
And you know, there's, she's still here.

999
01:10:41.44 --> 01:10:43.84
If nothing else, that's good.

1000
01:10:43.84 --> 01:10:45.44
If nothing else.

1001
01:10:45.44 --> 01:10:46.44
And so what are you going to do?

1002
01:10:46.44 --> 01:10:50.08
I mean, your, your other option is to say my daughter sick.

1003
01:10:50.08 --> 01:10:51.08
This is horrible.

1004
01:10:51.08 --> 01:10:52.08
I got cursed.

1005
01:10:52.08 --> 01:10:54.20
It's, it's not fair.

1006
01:10:54.20 --> 01:10:55.96
And what does that do for you?

1007
01:10:55.96 --> 01:10:56.80
Where does that get you?

1008
01:10:56.80 --> 01:10:58.32
It doesn't get you anywhere.

1009
01:10:58.32 --> 01:11:00.04
It matter fact that takes you backwards.

1010
01:11:00.04 --> 01:11:01.04
Yeah.

1011
01:11:01.04 --> 01:11:05.28
So you really truly do have to look at these horrible situations.

1012
01:11:05.28 --> 01:11:14.52
I remember, I got a call back from from overseas that a guy was a seal was really

1013
01:11:14.52 --> 01:11:16.92
badly wounded.

1014
01:11:16.92 --> 01:11:22.20
And a couple of my friends were kind of distraught.

1015
01:11:22.20 --> 01:11:25.88
And I talked to one of the guys overseas.

1016
01:11:25.88 --> 01:11:33.04
And I, you know, and, and man, I, at this point, you know, lost Mark, lost Mikey.

1017
01:11:33.04 --> 01:11:34.80
I don't think Ryan had died yet.

1018
01:11:34.80 --> 01:11:39.08
But like I was familiar with guys dying.

1019
01:11:39.08 --> 01:11:40.72
Yeah.

1020
01:11:40.72 --> 01:11:43.16
And I talked to one of the guys that was overseas.

1021
01:11:43.16 --> 01:11:46.96
And they said, hey, you know, this guy is really, really messed up.

1022
01:11:46.96 --> 01:11:49.52
And I'm like, is he going to live?

1023
01:11:49.52 --> 01:11:51.12
And they're like, yeah, he's stable.

1024
01:11:51.12 --> 01:11:54.56
And I go then don't worry about a thing.

1025
01:11:54.56 --> 01:11:55.72
Be happy.

1026
01:11:55.72 --> 01:11:56.72
He's alive.

1027
01:11:56.72 --> 01:12:02.36
And it doesn't matter if he's missing a leg or two legs or whatever, he's going

1028
01:12:02.36 --> 01:12:04.04
to be coming home.

1029
01:12:04.04 --> 01:12:06.24
And he's going to carry on with his life.

1030
01:12:06.24 --> 01:12:07.48
And it's going to be hard.

1031
01:12:07.48 --> 01:12:08.64
And it's going to be hell.

1032
01:12:08.64 --> 01:12:10.44
And it's going to be a challenge.

1033
01:12:10.44 --> 01:12:11.44
But guess what?

1034
01:12:11.44 --> 01:12:13.08
He's going to be here.

1035
01:12:13.08 --> 01:12:14.44
Yeah.

1036
01:12:14.44 --> 01:12:18.84
And that, you know, again, it's like, man, what's the alternative?

1037
01:12:18.84 --> 01:12:20.36
The alternative is he's dead.

1038
01:12:20.36 --> 01:12:22.92
The alternative is we never talk to him again.

1039
01:12:22.92 --> 01:12:24.40
That's the alternative.

1040
01:12:24.40 --> 01:12:25.40
Yeah.

1041
01:12:25.40 --> 01:12:26.40
He's going to come back.

1042
01:12:26.40 --> 01:12:27.40
Right?

1043
01:12:27.40 --> 01:12:31.80
And this guy, the guy that got wounded, he wasn't like a great friend of mine.

1044
01:12:31.80 --> 01:12:34.36
But I knew us talking to people that were very close to him.

1045
01:12:34.36 --> 01:12:39.28
And so, you know, I had to make sure I wasn't coming across like, hey, it's no big deal.

1046
01:12:39.28 --> 01:12:41.12
I, you know, look, he's going to be fine.

1047
01:12:41.12 --> 01:12:42.32
No, it wasn't like that.

1048
01:12:42.32 --> 01:12:44.12
But look, look what the alternative is.

1049
01:12:44.12 --> 01:12:47.48
You know, let's be thankful that he's alive.

1050
01:12:47.48 --> 01:12:48.48
Yeah.

1051
01:12:48.48 --> 01:12:49.48
And he's going to come home.

1052
01:12:49.48 --> 01:12:52.24
And we're, you know, he's going to carry on with his life.

1053
01:12:52.24 --> 01:12:53.72
And that's what's important.

1054
01:12:53.72 --> 01:12:59.32
So it's really when you do look at these situations, when things are going bad.

1055
01:12:59.32 --> 01:13:00.52
And then you say, okay, well, good.

1056
01:13:00.52 --> 01:13:01.52
Come with that.

1057
01:13:01.52 --> 01:13:05.16
And then the one step further is then what happens when someone does die?

1058
01:13:05.16 --> 01:13:06.80
Then what good comes of that?

1059
01:13:06.80 --> 01:13:09.56
And my thought is always the same thing.

1060
01:13:09.56 --> 01:13:12.72
I'm thankful that I got to know that person.

1061
01:13:12.72 --> 01:13:16.84
I'm thankful that I got to understand their personality.

1062
01:13:16.84 --> 01:13:22.24
I'm thankful that I got to spend a day with them laughing and having that memory.

1063
01:13:22.24 --> 01:13:23.24
Yeah.

1064
01:13:23.24 --> 01:13:27.36
So, what's good is I got to experience them in my life and they got to experience other

1065
01:13:27.36 --> 01:13:28.56
people's in their lives.

1066
01:13:28.56 --> 01:13:31.24
And that's what's good about it.

1067
01:13:31.24 --> 01:13:38.32
But just to say, hey, you know, my friend, my family member is dead.

1068
01:13:38.32 --> 01:13:39.76
This is horrible.

1069
01:13:39.76 --> 01:13:41.48
And I can't escape from this.

1070
01:13:41.48 --> 01:13:42.48
Wrong attitude.

1071
01:13:42.48 --> 01:13:44.52
And of course, you're going to go through that.

1072
01:13:44.52 --> 01:13:47.24
It's the, there's the, whatever those things are that you go through.

1073
01:13:47.24 --> 01:13:48.24
It's shock.

1074
01:13:48.24 --> 01:13:49.24
And then denial.

1075
01:13:49.24 --> 01:13:53.48
And then anger and then acceptance and all that.

1076
01:13:53.48 --> 01:13:54.80
That's I get it.

1077
01:13:54.80 --> 01:13:56.76
And it's not going to be easy.

1078
01:13:56.76 --> 01:14:02.48
But I'll tell you what will make it easier is to look at the situation and say, what

1079
01:14:02.48 --> 01:14:04.36
here is good.

1080
01:14:04.36 --> 01:14:09.40
You know, and you, one of the worst things is parents without have young children that

1081
01:14:09.40 --> 01:14:10.64
are terminally ill.

1082
01:14:10.64 --> 01:14:12.28
It's awful.

1083
01:14:12.28 --> 01:14:13.80
It's awful.

1084
01:14:13.80 --> 01:14:18.24
And the best you can think of is say, hold them while you can.

1085
01:14:18.24 --> 01:14:19.24
Right?

1086
01:14:19.24 --> 01:14:23.28
And get what you can and grow the memories that you can right now.

1087
01:14:23.28 --> 01:14:27.72
Because just to focus on the fact that life isn't fair isn't going to help you.

1088
01:14:27.72 --> 01:14:28.72
And guess what?

1089
01:14:28.72 --> 01:14:29.72
You're right.

1090
01:14:29.72 --> 01:14:30.72
Life isn't fair.

1091
01:14:30.72 --> 01:14:31.72
Yeah.

1092
01:14:31.72 --> 01:14:32.72
Life isn't fair.

1093
01:14:32.72 --> 01:14:37.16
It's, it's a random, horrible thing.

1094
01:14:37.16 --> 01:14:41.76
And if you want to focus on the randomness and the horribleness of it, that's where you're

1095
01:14:41.76 --> 01:14:43.36
going to end up.

1096
01:14:43.36 --> 01:14:48.60
And if you can focus on the good that comes out of those situations, try to.

1097
01:14:48.60 --> 01:14:50.52
And again, I haven't been through that.

1098
01:14:50.52 --> 01:14:51.52
I haven't been through that.

1099
01:14:51.52 --> 01:14:52.52
Thank God.

1100
01:14:52.52 --> 01:14:53.52
Yeah, not that level.

1101
01:14:53.52 --> 01:14:59.60
But the best I can do, the best I can assess is say, man, at least try and look at what

1102
01:14:59.60 --> 01:15:01.72
positive is coming out of this.

1103
01:15:01.72 --> 01:15:06.80
And focus on that instead of focusing on what is negative, chew.

1104
01:15:06.80 --> 01:15:08.20
It's going back to what Frankl said.

1105
01:15:08.20 --> 01:15:10.40
You choose what you're at if you're just going to be.

1106
01:15:10.40 --> 01:15:11.40
Yeah.

1107
01:15:11.40 --> 01:15:14.16
Don't become a victim of the randomness.

1108
01:15:14.16 --> 01:15:15.16
Yeah.

1109
01:15:15.16 --> 01:15:18.20
And that goes on on all levels.

1110
01:15:18.20 --> 01:15:24.08
You know, even if something isn't horrible, it's just kind of junk.

1111
01:15:24.08 --> 01:15:27.80
All the way down to just something that's pretty horrible.

1112
01:15:27.80 --> 01:15:30.84
There's still a lot of good going on in the situation.

1113
01:15:30.84 --> 01:15:35.48
But in just like, are you saying, like, your attitude or another way to put it is what you're

1114
01:15:35.48 --> 01:15:38.08
looking for to internalize?

1115
01:15:38.08 --> 01:15:40.16
You know, a lot of times I know it's natural.

1116
01:15:40.16 --> 01:15:43.12
And I've been there where it's like, everything just seems bad.

1117
01:15:43.12 --> 01:15:46.36
Even the smut like, if something real bad happens, that you think is real bad.

1118
01:15:46.36 --> 01:15:51.32
And then the same day or the next year, whatever, something small bad happens, it'll just

1119
01:15:51.32 --> 01:15:52.88
add big time to the badness.

1120
01:15:52.88 --> 01:15:54.04
Like, nothing's going right.

1121
01:15:54.04 --> 01:15:55.04
Kind of attitude.

1122
01:15:55.04 --> 01:15:57.44
Meanwhile, all the good things are going on all around you.

1123
01:15:57.44 --> 01:15:58.96
We're not looking for that all those things.

1124
01:15:58.96 --> 01:15:59.96
Yeah.

1125
01:15:59.96 --> 01:16:03.32
So in a lot of times with like, real bad situations, especially with kids, because that's

1126
01:16:03.32 --> 01:16:07.40
like the the most weak you can ever feel really like your kid.

1127
01:16:07.40 --> 01:16:09.68
Like when my daughter had to chew a big staff infection.

1128
01:16:09.68 --> 01:16:13.36
And so in her lymph nodes over neck of the age and the hospital for a week.

1129
01:16:13.36 --> 01:16:15.68
And we're there.

1130
01:16:15.68 --> 01:16:20.60
That's like the most weak in that that you'll feel in, of course, there's way worse situations.

1131
01:16:20.60 --> 01:16:21.60
Yeah.

1132
01:16:21.60 --> 01:16:23.36
And then that's nothing compared to situations.

1133
01:16:23.36 --> 01:16:24.56
I know that.

1134
01:16:24.56 --> 01:16:30.52
But there are good things that are still going on in your situation, your life.

1135
01:16:30.52 --> 01:16:34.92
That's a B. There's good situations that can come of it.

1136
01:16:34.92 --> 01:16:38.000
And a lot of them, a lot of them are strength related.

1137
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.56
You know, like if you let something beat you down and you don't get this strength, like

1138
01:16:42.56 --> 01:16:43.56
that's a loss.

1139
01:16:43.56 --> 01:16:44.56
You'll lose.

1140
01:16:44.56 --> 01:16:48.96
Like you'll, so you're saying you're getting some kind of conditioning from it.

1141
01:16:48.96 --> 01:16:51.12
In a way, in a matter of speaking, yes.

1142
01:16:51.12 --> 01:16:57.32
So like if you have a quote unquote good attitude, when you emerge from the situation,

1143
01:16:57.32 --> 01:16:59.28
you will have strength now.

1144
01:16:59.28 --> 01:17:01.24
If you don't, you won't, you'll have weakness.

1145
01:17:01.24 --> 01:17:03.04
You'll be, you know, gun shy.

1146
01:17:03.04 --> 01:17:04.20
Everything happens bad.

1147
01:17:04.20 --> 01:17:05.20
My life sucks.

1148
01:17:05.20 --> 01:17:07.000
And you know, you'll continue down.

1149
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.32
And then that road.

1150
01:17:08.32 --> 01:17:13.84
So the good part, like if you said, like I said, if you keep that good attitude, and when

1151
01:17:13.84 --> 01:17:18.76
you make it out, you will have the other good things that can come from it.

1152
01:17:18.76 --> 01:17:20.48
You will have the strength.

1153
01:17:20.48 --> 01:17:21.48
Yeah.

1154
01:17:21.48 --> 01:17:22.48
And you're right.

1155
01:17:22.48 --> 01:17:25.72
And I mean, just look at Captain Plum and look at Colonel Reader.

1156
01:17:25.72 --> 01:17:30.68
Anyhow, for those guys to go through what they went through and maintain a positive attitude.

1157
01:17:30.68 --> 01:17:33.88
And then they come out and you talk to those guys and it's like, you can't think of

1158
01:17:33.88 --> 01:17:36.000
more positive people in the world.

1159
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Yeah.

1160
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
You know, I mean, not in the whole world, but you, they're just have so much positivity

1161
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.24
because they've been through something and they had to maintain that attitude.

1162
01:17:44.24 --> 01:17:45.52
So you're right when they come out.

1163
01:17:45.52 --> 01:17:47.44
It's like how are you going to make?

1164
01:17:47.44 --> 01:17:52.48
And I think that's what happens a lot of times with guys that have been to war is they

1165
01:17:52.48 --> 01:17:54.76
come back and they're like happy to see the sunrise.

1166
01:17:54.76 --> 01:17:55.76
I know I am.

1167
01:17:55.76 --> 01:17:57.52
I'm happy to see the sunrise.

1168
01:17:57.52 --> 01:18:00.000
I'm happier than a lot of people to see the sunrise.

1169
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.76
I appreciate that thing.

1170
01:18:01.76 --> 01:18:05.28
And I think when people go through some kind of devastating disease in their family or

1171
01:18:05.28 --> 01:18:10.16
themselves, same thing once they get through it, they at least come out the other side and

1172
01:18:10.16 --> 01:18:11.80
they can appreciate it.

1173
01:18:11.80 --> 01:18:15.36
And yet if they let it beat them down, it's going to, it's going to everything is going

1174
01:18:15.36 --> 01:18:16.36
to look down.

1175
01:18:16.36 --> 01:18:17.64
If you're looking down, you're going to look down.

1176
01:18:17.64 --> 01:18:19.36
If you're looking up, you're going to look up.

1177
01:18:19.36 --> 01:18:20.36
Yeah.

1178
01:18:20.36 --> 01:18:23.16
That's got to be a, it's hard.

1179
01:18:23.16 --> 01:18:24.88
I mean, it's so hard for people.

1180
01:18:24.88 --> 01:18:25.88
It's so hard.

1181
01:18:25.88 --> 01:18:26.88
Yeah.

1182
01:18:26.88 --> 01:18:28.64
And again, I'm over here talking, you know.

1183
01:18:28.64 --> 01:18:30.000
Yeah, for sure, both of us are.

1184
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.48
You know, when I was on Joe Rogan, we started off talking about Chris Cornell, it's kill

1185
01:18:34.48 --> 01:18:35.48
himself.

1186
01:18:35.48 --> 01:18:38.28
We kind of cursory kind of talked about depression and neither want to.

1187
01:18:38.28 --> 01:18:44.08
I mean, I definitely am not claiming to be any kind of expert at all about it.

1188
01:18:44.08 --> 01:18:46.24
And I even said on there, I was like, look, I've never felt this way.

1189
01:18:46.24 --> 01:18:49.32
And I had just a couple of people hit me up on social media like, you know, you should

1190
01:18:49.32 --> 01:18:54.08
you should read this or you should do this or and, and, you know, or you're not right.

1191
01:18:54.08 --> 01:18:56.96
And I'm like, no, I wasn't even trying to say anything that I'm right.

1192
01:18:56.96 --> 01:18:59.92
I'm just tell, I was saying, I don't actually even know.

1193
01:18:59.92 --> 01:19:00.92
Yeah.

1194
01:19:00.92 --> 01:19:07.24
And so yeah, I'm not, you know, certainly an expert on how to overcome, you know, horrible

1195
01:19:07.24 --> 01:19:08.24
situations.

1196
01:19:08.24 --> 01:19:10.60
But I've been in some pretty horrible situations.

1197
01:19:10.60 --> 01:19:12.84
And this is what my thoughts tried to be.

1198
01:19:12.84 --> 01:19:13.84
Yeah.

1199
01:19:13.84 --> 01:19:15.84
And it's not always easy at all.

1200
01:19:15.84 --> 01:19:16.84
Yeah.

1201
01:19:16.84 --> 01:19:23.40
Jordan Peterson has some good good, you know, good content on that where he's basically

1202
01:19:23.40 --> 01:19:28.84
in that cell, he says, get yourself together where in his example, one of the many was,

1203
01:19:28.84 --> 01:19:31.80
you know, a family member dies or whatever, get yourself together.

1204
01:19:31.80 --> 01:19:33.04
So, you know, what are you going to do?

1205
01:19:33.04 --> 01:19:35.32
Are you going to wallow with the rest of the people?

1206
01:19:35.32 --> 01:19:39.000
So, no one can get a hold of anything in the funerals of master, whatever, or you

1207
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.52
can get yourself together, grief for sure, get, but get yourself together.

1208
01:19:42.52 --> 01:19:47.68
So, you can kind of lead and get the funeral together and take care of the business or whatever.

1209
01:19:47.68 --> 01:19:50.76
And it's such a cold, blooded thing to say, right?

1210
01:19:50.76 --> 01:19:51.96
It's the complete.

1211
01:19:51.96 --> 01:19:57.12
And that's what I think is hard about it is, you know, think about this.

1212
01:19:57.12 --> 01:20:00.56
Oh, if someone in your family died and I was like, echo, get yourself together.

1213
01:20:00.56 --> 01:20:01.56
Right.

1214
01:20:01.56 --> 01:20:02.56
You know what I mean?

1215
01:20:02.56 --> 01:20:03.56
Who says that?

1216
01:20:03.56 --> 01:20:05.96
But that's probably the best thing I could possibly say to you.

1217
01:20:05.96 --> 01:20:06.96
Yeah.

1218
01:20:06.96 --> 01:20:08.16
I might need to say it in a more tactful way.

1219
01:20:08.16 --> 01:20:13.04
I might just say, hey, I command, I feel for you, hey, man, what we need to do is

1220
01:20:13.04 --> 01:20:15.08
grieve, but we also need to focus on moving forward.

1221
01:20:15.08 --> 01:20:16.08
You know what I mean?

1222
01:20:16.08 --> 01:20:17.08
It's that kind of thing.

1223
01:20:17.08 --> 01:20:18.64
But the reality is, what am I really saying?

1224
01:20:18.64 --> 01:20:21.48
I'm really saying, hey, get yourself together.

1225
01:20:21.48 --> 01:20:22.48
You got to move on.

1226
01:20:22.48 --> 01:20:23.48
We got to move on.

1227
01:20:23.48 --> 01:20:24.76
We got to move forward.

1228
01:20:24.76 --> 01:20:26.16
You got to move forward in your life.

1229
01:20:26.16 --> 01:20:28.92
And that's such a hard thing to say to somebody.

1230
01:20:28.92 --> 01:20:29.92
Yeah.

1231
01:20:29.92 --> 01:20:33.000
But that's probably the right attitude to take.

1232
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Yeah.

1233
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Okay.

1234
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Like, this is horrible.

1235
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.56
And I need to keep it together.

1236
01:20:38.56 --> 01:20:39.56
Yeah.

1237
01:20:39.56 --> 01:20:40.56
Yeah.

1238
01:20:40.56 --> 01:20:48.04
Yeah, man, especially when there's no majorly prevalent things that are at risk

1239
01:20:48.04 --> 01:20:49.64
at that moment as well.

1240
01:20:49.64 --> 01:20:54.40
You know, like, your situation, like, in a combat situation, I think BTF Tony was talking

1241
01:20:54.40 --> 01:20:55.40
about this.

1242
01:20:55.40 --> 01:20:59.96
If you're in a firefight or something like that, and something gets hit, you don't just

1243
01:20:59.96 --> 01:21:00.96
quit.

1244
01:21:00.96 --> 01:21:01.96
No.

1245
01:21:01.96 --> 01:21:02.96
Exit the fire fighting.

1246
01:21:02.96 --> 01:21:03.96
Oh, my gosh, my guy's hit.

1247
01:21:03.96 --> 01:21:05.36
It's like, okay, he's hit.

1248
01:21:05.36 --> 01:21:06.36
Boom.

1249
01:21:06.36 --> 01:21:07.60
Let's continue the firefight.

1250
01:21:07.60 --> 01:21:09.08
But let's say there was no firefight.

1251
01:21:09.08 --> 01:21:10.24
Then the guy gets hit.

1252
01:21:10.24 --> 01:21:14.32
It seems like a harder thing to just move on.

1253
01:21:14.32 --> 01:21:15.32
So what are you talking about?

1254
01:21:15.32 --> 01:21:16.32
Yeah.

1255
01:21:16.32 --> 01:21:18.52
You need to have a firefight going on.

1256
01:21:18.52 --> 01:21:24.000
So that you, so that you can say, okay, I'm going to deal with this.

1257
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.20
But I need to also think about the rest of life.

1258
01:21:27.20 --> 01:21:28.20
Yeah.

1259
01:21:28.20 --> 01:21:29.20
So hard.

1260
01:21:29.20 --> 01:21:32.96
And, you know, again, it's, you know what I'm feeling like right now?

1261
01:21:32.96 --> 01:21:38.24
I got, I get some social media sometimes where someone will say, hey, I'm not a vet.

1262
01:21:38.24 --> 01:21:40.08
But like a friend of mine is going through problems.

1263
01:21:40.08 --> 01:21:41.76
And I don't know how to talk to him because I'm not a vet.

1264
01:21:41.76 --> 01:21:43.08
And that's kind of like what I feel like right now.

1265
01:21:43.08 --> 01:21:45.08
Like I haven't been through those kind of suffering.

1266
01:21:45.08 --> 01:21:47.92
So I'm throwing darts.

1267
01:21:47.92 --> 01:21:49.68
But I'm throwing them based on what I know.

1268
01:21:49.68 --> 01:21:52.92
So it's the best, like, you know, best I could do.

1269
01:21:52.92 --> 01:21:53.92
Yeah.

1270
01:21:53.92 --> 01:21:58.80
You're at risk of someone saying, hey, you simply don't understand.

1271
01:21:58.80 --> 01:21:59.80
And my fact is there.

1272
01:21:59.80 --> 01:22:00.80
Yeah.

1273
01:22:00.80 --> 01:22:03.80
And my statement to that would be, yes, I don't understand.

1274
01:22:03.80 --> 01:22:08.92
You know, it's like in the, when I was talking to veterans saying, look, people, you feel

1275
01:22:08.92 --> 01:22:10.32
like people don't understand?

1276
01:22:10.32 --> 01:22:11.32
They don't.

1277
01:22:11.32 --> 01:22:12.32
And that's okay.

1278
01:22:12.32 --> 01:22:15.80
And so definitely not sitting here saying, oh, you know, I know.

1279
01:22:15.80 --> 01:22:17.24
This is what you're doing in a situation like that.

1280
01:22:17.24 --> 01:22:18.24
No, I don't know.

1281
01:22:18.24 --> 01:22:19.24
Yeah.

1282
01:22:19.24 --> 01:22:22.84
I don't know what you do when your family member suffers something.

1283
01:22:22.84 --> 01:22:24.52
I agree just like that.

1284
01:22:24.52 --> 01:22:26.28
Like a terminal disease or deaf.

1285
01:22:26.28 --> 01:22:27.88
I don't know.

1286
01:22:27.88 --> 01:22:30.16
Haven't been through it.

1287
01:22:30.16 --> 01:22:33.32
What I have been through is losing guys in combat.

1288
01:22:33.32 --> 01:22:34.68
That I have been through.

1289
01:22:34.68 --> 01:22:37.16
This is, this is darkness.

1290
01:22:37.16 --> 01:22:39.84
It's a different kind of darkness.

1291
01:22:39.84 --> 01:22:45.000
But this is what I did in those situations.

1292
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.88
And that's what I would think would help you in these other situations.

1293
01:22:50.88 --> 01:22:51.88
Hard.

1294
01:22:51.88 --> 01:22:52.88
Question, right?

1295
01:22:52.88 --> 01:22:53.88
What do you do?

1296
01:22:53.88 --> 01:22:54.88
Hard.

1297
01:22:54.88 --> 01:22:59.96
And we are sitting here reading a book by a guy that was in a concentration camp.

1298
01:22:59.96 --> 01:23:03.12
And he's saying this thing to do.

1299
01:23:03.12 --> 01:23:13.92
So that's another sort of reinforcement of this thought pattern.

1300
01:23:13.92 --> 01:23:14.92
Yeah.

1301
01:23:14.92 --> 01:23:17.56
All right.

1302
01:23:17.56 --> 01:23:20.48
He talks a little bit about the passage of time here.

1303
01:23:20.48 --> 01:23:24.12
In camp, a small unit of time.

1304
01:23:24.12 --> 01:23:30.64
A day, for example, filled with hourly tortures and fatigue appeared endless.

1305
01:23:30.64 --> 01:23:35.56
A larger time unit, perhaps a week, seemed to pass very quickly.

1306
01:23:35.56 --> 01:23:42.84
My comrades agreed when I said that in the camp, a day lasted longer than a week.

1307
01:23:42.84 --> 01:23:46.16
How paradoxical was our time experience.

1308
01:23:46.16 --> 01:23:50.16
And that's something this actually reminded me I was talking to a Sarah Armstrong.

1309
01:23:50.16 --> 01:23:54.72
And well now it's actually around the conversation when life was talking about heat

1310
01:23:54.72 --> 01:23:58.76
come out here and seeing all my kids, my kids are all grown up now.

1311
01:23:58.76 --> 01:24:01.20
Basically, except for my little list one.

1312
01:24:01.20 --> 01:24:04.28
But my oldest daughter's graduate in high school, you know, a couple of weeks and she's

1313
01:24:04.28 --> 01:24:05.68
going to go to college.

1314
01:24:05.68 --> 01:24:10.92
And you know, when life met her, she was, what was that 12 years ago?

1315
01:24:10.92 --> 01:24:19.08
So she was, you know, no, six, something like that.

1316
01:24:19.08 --> 01:24:24.56
So, you know, young and then you came out here, you know, he just come left his apartment

1317
01:24:24.56 --> 01:24:28.48
in New York City where he's got his wife and kids and they're, you know, it's chaos

1318
01:24:28.48 --> 01:24:32.52
and little kids and they're crying and screaming and spilling stuff and throwing up milk

1319
01:24:32.52 --> 01:24:37.000
and pissing everywhere and it's just, you know, that's what life is when you're there.

1320
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.36
And you know, he came out here and saw how my kids were now grown up.

1321
01:24:41.36 --> 01:24:43.40
That time has gone, by the way, gone.

1322
01:24:43.40 --> 01:24:45.52
And get it back.

1323
01:24:45.52 --> 01:24:49.80
And he, you know, he talked about it on the podcast, just name and make sure you appreciate

1324
01:24:49.80 --> 01:24:50.80
those.

1325
01:24:50.80 --> 01:24:55.76
And Sarah Armstrong, you know, said something along the lines of the days are long, but the

1326
01:24:55.76 --> 01:24:56.76
years are short.

1327
01:24:56.76 --> 01:24:57.76
Yeah.

1328
01:24:57.76 --> 01:24:59.16
That's a very true statement.

1329
01:24:59.16 --> 01:25:02.16
And you can, you can see that cured the same thing.

1330
01:25:02.16 --> 01:25:13.12
You know, all of a sudden, this time is just going by so quickly.

1331
01:25:13.12 --> 01:25:15.92
This is starting to talk again back to the attitude.

1332
01:25:15.92 --> 01:25:20.64
We could say that most men in a concentration camp believe that the real opportunities of

1333
01:25:20.64 --> 01:25:22.44
life had passed.

1334
01:25:22.44 --> 01:25:26.24
Yet in reality, there was an opportunity and a challenge.

1335
01:25:26.24 --> 01:25:33.44
One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or

1336
01:25:33.44 --> 01:25:39.48
one could ignore the challenges and simply vegetate as did a majority of the prisoners.

1337
01:25:39.48 --> 01:25:41.36
Same thing, same topic.

1338
01:25:41.36 --> 01:25:43.08
I know it's interesting.

1339
01:25:43.08 --> 01:25:48.68
I told you this before we started this book, you know, is a great book.

1340
01:25:48.68 --> 01:25:55.40
But I, I kind of wanted to talk about how bad concentration camps were, and I went and

1341
01:25:55.40 --> 01:25:59.000
found some other sources for that.

1342
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Because Victor Franco doesn't highlight it that much.

1343
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.28
I mean, his ad, I mean, he was in Auschwitz for crying out loud.

1344
01:26:06.28 --> 01:26:08.28
Doesn't get any worse.

1345
01:26:08.28 --> 01:26:13.92
And, you know, to really give the impact of how bad it was, I went and found some other

1346
01:26:13.92 --> 01:26:20.000
sources that were a little bit more directly written and a little bit more horrifying

1347
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.68
to be lack of a better word.

1348
01:26:22.68 --> 01:26:27.20
Because in his accounts, he doesn't go into those, some of those graphic details, which

1349
01:26:27.20 --> 01:26:30.60
I feel like you should know, and you should understand what.

1350
01:26:30.60 --> 01:26:32.72
Before you talk about, hey, he's keeping a good attitude.

1351
01:26:32.72 --> 01:26:36.000
But no, no, it's not he's keeping a good attitude, because he was in a concentration camp,

1352
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000
but it wasn't that bad.

1353
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
No.

1354
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.20
And that's what he's dealing with.

1355
01:26:40.20 --> 01:26:47.60
And in his mind, you could make a triumph or a victory out of those experiences, which

1356
01:26:47.60 --> 01:26:51.20
is incredible attitude to have.

1357
01:26:51.20 --> 01:27:01.36
Going back to the book, the prisoner who had lost faith in the future, his future was

1358
01:27:01.36 --> 01:27:03.36
doomed.

1359
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:07.56
With his loss of belief in the future, he also lost his spiritual hold.

1360
01:27:07.56 --> 01:27:14.32
He let himself decline and became subject to mental and physical decay.

1361
01:27:14.32 --> 01:27:18.44
Usually this happened quite suddenly in the form of a crisis, the symptoms of which were

1362
01:27:18.44 --> 01:27:22.08
familiar to the experience camp inmate.

1363
01:27:22.08 --> 01:27:26.24
We all feared this moment, not for ourselves, which would have been pointless, but for

1364
01:27:26.24 --> 01:27:28.04
our friends.

1365
01:27:28.04 --> 01:27:32.64
Usually it began with the prisoner refusing one morning to get dressed and wash or to

1366
01:27:32.64 --> 01:27:35.16
go out on the parade grounds.

1367
01:27:35.16 --> 01:27:39.72
No intrudes, no blows, no threats had any effect.

1368
01:27:39.72 --> 01:27:42.68
He just lay there hardly moving.

1369
01:27:42.68 --> 01:27:47.88
If this crisis was brought about by an illness, he refused to be taken to the sick bay or

1370
01:27:47.88 --> 01:27:49.88
do anything to help himself.

1371
01:27:49.88 --> 01:27:52.92
He simply gave up.

1372
01:27:52.92 --> 01:28:02.16
There he remained lying in his own extra, excret a, and nothing bothered him anymore.

1373
01:28:02.16 --> 01:28:09.48
That's similar to what Colonel Riderset, how if you didn't actively stay alive, you

1374
01:28:09.48 --> 01:28:10.68
would die.

1375
01:28:10.68 --> 01:28:13.04
You couldn't just passively exist.

1376
01:28:13.04 --> 01:28:14.04
You weren't going to make it.

1377
01:28:14.04 --> 01:28:20.64
If you wanted to die, all you had to do is stop trying, then you were going to die.

1378
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:24.60
Back to the book, as we said before, any attempt to restore a man's inner strength in

1379
01:28:24.60 --> 01:28:30.96
the camp had to first succeed in showing him some future goal.

1380
01:28:30.96 --> 01:28:43.04
In Nietzsche's words, he who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.

1381
01:28:43.04 --> 01:28:49.28
That could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohyogenic efforts regarding

1382
01:28:49.28 --> 01:28:51.68
prisoners.

1383
01:28:51.68 --> 01:28:56.52
Whenever there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why, an aim for their

1384
01:28:56.52 --> 01:28:57.92
lives.

1385
01:28:57.92 --> 01:29:04.14
In order to strengthen them to bear the terrible how of their existence, what to him who

1386
01:29:04.14 --> 01:29:12.000
saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, and therefore no point to carrying on.

1387
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.48
He was soon lost.

1388
01:29:14.48 --> 01:29:18.08
Got to know why you're doing what you're doing.

1389
01:29:18.08 --> 01:29:19.84
That's all there is to it.

1390
01:29:19.84 --> 01:29:26.12
He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.

1391
01:29:26.12 --> 01:29:30.44
Obviously, that translates right into a leader's perspective, making sure people understand

1392
01:29:30.44 --> 01:29:31.44
why they're doing what they're doing.

1393
01:29:31.44 --> 01:29:33.36
You just don't part of quarters at him.

1394
01:29:33.36 --> 01:29:37.84
But from an individual perspective, why are you doing this?

1395
01:29:37.84 --> 01:29:40.84
Find that.

1396
01:29:40.84 --> 01:29:47.88
I actually made a post on social media the other day.

1397
01:29:47.88 --> 01:29:53.32
It was something long, a lot of finding your inner why or something like that.

1398
01:29:53.32 --> 01:29:58.72
I was mocking that attitude.

1399
01:29:58.72 --> 01:30:04.36
I was saying sometimes my inner voice is trying to find out why I'm doing what I'm doing.

1400
01:30:04.36 --> 01:30:07.04
When I'm doing something hard, my inner voice doesn't allow to talk.

1401
01:30:07.04 --> 01:30:08.04
Be quiet.

1402
01:30:08.04 --> 01:30:12.76
I'm over here working.

1403
01:30:12.76 --> 01:30:18.48
But there is, obviously, just like a leadership perspective and from a personal perspective,

1404
01:30:18.48 --> 01:30:20.08
why are you doing what you're doing?

1405
01:30:20.08 --> 01:30:23.16
That should be the driving force.

1406
01:30:23.16 --> 01:30:26.32
If you don't have that, it's hard to overcome these challenges.

1407
01:30:26.32 --> 01:30:29.48
You can't just overcome challenges just because they're there.

1408
01:30:29.48 --> 01:30:32.16
You need some greater reason.

1409
01:30:32.16 --> 01:30:35.92
When that gets lost, you get lost.

1410
01:30:35.92 --> 01:30:40.16
I don't know why I thought those were.

1411
01:30:40.16 --> 01:30:45.92
I think the one why you were mocking that, this is my why.

1412
01:30:45.92 --> 01:30:50.64
It wasn't, it wasn't, now that I think about it, it wasn't really the why thing.

1413
01:30:50.64 --> 01:30:52.28
It was more about the inner voice.

1414
01:30:52.28 --> 01:30:55.12
But yeah, I know I definitely said why in the tale.

1415
01:30:55.12 --> 01:31:01.68
Because people do, it's like a lot of good expressions or things or whatever.

1416
01:31:01.68 --> 01:31:05.88
Or people just, oh, I like that and they'll just start throwing it out and abusing it.

1417
01:31:05.88 --> 01:31:09.88
It dumps it down and then everyone's saying it, now it just sort of sounds cheesy because

1418
01:31:09.88 --> 01:31:11.36
no one's actually doing it.

1419
01:31:11.36 --> 01:31:15.28
No one's actually understanding the real what it really means.

1420
01:31:15.28 --> 01:31:21.32
The person who's like, hey, I'm going to lose weight and they've basically spent their life neglecting

1421
01:31:21.32 --> 01:31:22.32
their health or whatever.

1422
01:31:22.32 --> 01:31:28.20
They're like, okay, I'm going to get in shape and then they go on this program.

1423
01:31:28.20 --> 01:31:32.80
They quit, but when they're doing good on the program, let's say the first or second day,

1424
01:31:32.80 --> 01:31:38.08
they'll be like, this is my why and they'll show their dog or something like that.

1425
01:31:38.08 --> 01:31:43.40
My why or my kids or whatever, but then the next day they quit the program.

1426
01:31:43.40 --> 01:31:44.40
It's such a weak thing.

1427
01:31:44.40 --> 01:31:47.44
You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't just do that.

1428
01:31:47.44 --> 01:31:49.84
That whole thing, my why.

1429
01:31:49.84 --> 01:31:54.08
Whatever, that's way too powerful for people to just be like, hey, my why and then just not do it.

1430
01:31:54.08 --> 01:31:55.72
It should know just like a little thing.

1431
01:31:55.72 --> 01:32:01.92
You can't just throw a together a 38 second Instagram post that's about you.

1432
01:32:01.92 --> 01:32:02.92
Why.

1433
01:32:02.92 --> 01:32:03.92
That need you need to dig.

1434
01:32:03.92 --> 01:32:05.36
Yeah, you gotta do that stuff.

1435
01:32:05.36 --> 01:32:10.000
So that's why it's funny because like, people just throw that out now.

1436
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.20
Not means like nothing and it's almost like they seem, it seems like it seems like it's

1437
01:32:15.20 --> 01:32:17.04
totally my interpretation of it.

1438
01:32:17.04 --> 01:32:22.84
But it seems like they're saying it and thinking that they sound so profound and deep and

1439
01:32:22.84 --> 01:32:26.52
new and inspirational, you know, but everyone's saying it.

1440
01:32:26.52 --> 01:32:33.80
And to counter your point, I've had plenty of people that have talked to me about, you

1441
01:32:33.80 --> 01:32:34.80
know, I wasn't bad shape.

1442
01:32:34.80 --> 01:32:36.48
I wasn't taking care of myself.

1443
01:32:36.48 --> 01:32:40.08
I wasn't healthy and I had my first kid.

1444
01:32:40.08 --> 01:32:45.08
And I said to myself, I need to be there for my kid or I was doing bad at work and I didn't

1445
01:32:45.08 --> 01:32:48.28
like Aaron, it wasn't focused on that career, it wasn't focused on being squared away and

1446
01:32:48.28 --> 01:32:50.96
I was wasting all my money on dumb stuff and I had my first kid.

1447
01:32:50.96 --> 01:32:51.96
Yeah.

1448
01:32:51.96 --> 01:32:55.56
And then I said, I gotta, you know, this, this is me taking care of my kid and I need to do a

1449
01:32:55.56 --> 01:32:56.56
damn good job.

1450
01:32:56.56 --> 01:33:00.64
And that's exactly the point right there is that it's a real thing.

1451
01:33:00.64 --> 01:33:03.44
And if that's for real, you're, you're why conceptually no.

1452
01:33:03.44 --> 01:33:05.84
I'm just in the expression for sure.

1453
01:33:05.84 --> 01:33:09.000
For sure, but there's a big difference between, well, there's a big difference between

1454
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.16
between the contemplation that goes into.

1455
01:33:11.16 --> 01:33:12.16
I'm doing this for my kid.

1456
01:33:12.16 --> 01:33:13.16
It's cool.

1457
01:33:13.16 --> 01:33:14.16
I'm going to go on weight watchers.

1458
01:33:14.16 --> 01:33:15.16
Right?

1459
01:33:15.16 --> 01:33:18.56
It's like, um, no, like think about this.

1460
01:33:18.56 --> 01:33:22.32
Think about your relationship with your children and where you're going to end up and

1461
01:33:22.32 --> 01:33:25.88
now you want to see them live and what guidance you can give them as human beings.

1462
01:33:25.88 --> 01:33:29.76
And the example that you're sending for them and you line all those things up, then

1463
01:33:29.76 --> 01:33:31.32
maybe you can put down the donuts.

1464
01:33:31.32 --> 01:33:33.12
Yeah, you're not clear it.

1465
01:33:33.12 --> 01:33:34.12
In other words, you gotta do it.

1466
01:33:34.12 --> 01:33:35.12
Yeah.

1467
01:33:35.12 --> 01:33:38.80
Actually, you know, so yeah, that's why it just sounds cheesy because everyone does it.

1468
01:33:38.80 --> 01:33:40.68
It says it.

1469
01:33:40.68 --> 01:33:43.04
This is a great section going back to the book.

1470
01:33:43.04 --> 01:33:49.68
We had to learn ourselves and furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men that it

1471
01:33:49.68 --> 01:33:59.64
did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.

1472
01:33:59.64 --> 01:34:04.000
We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life and instead to think of ourselves as

1473
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.64
those who were being questioned by life daily and hourly.

1474
01:34:10.64 --> 01:34:19.72
One answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and right conduct.

1475
01:34:19.72 --> 01:34:25.04
Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems

1476
01:34:25.04 --> 01:34:30.88
and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.

1477
01:34:30.88 --> 01:34:34.40
Again, you're turning, you're flipping this idea around.

1478
01:34:34.40 --> 01:34:37.08
It's not about what I want from life.

1479
01:34:37.08 --> 01:34:39.64
It's what what is life want from me.

1480
01:34:39.64 --> 01:34:43.32
And it's putting these challenges and these hurdles in front of me and I gotta go and jump

1481
01:34:43.32 --> 01:34:44.60
over them.

1482
01:34:44.60 --> 01:34:48.64
And then I got a smash them and then I got to set fire to them and then I got to use that

1483
01:34:48.64 --> 01:34:54.04
fire to fuel the domination of everything that's in my path.

1484
01:34:54.04 --> 01:34:57.04
That kind of like, hey, these weights aren't going to lift themselves.

1485
01:34:57.04 --> 01:34:58.84
It's the exact same thing.

1486
01:34:58.84 --> 01:35:01.16
It's the exact same thing.

1487
01:35:01.16 --> 01:35:06.000
Yeah.

1488
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:16.52
And again, going back to this idea that war reveals human nature and this is Dr. Frankl's

1489
01:35:16.52 --> 01:35:21.64
way of putting this exact same thing that I say back to the book, Life and a concentration

1490
01:35:21.64 --> 01:35:27.40
camp tore open the human soul and exposed its depths.

1491
01:35:27.40 --> 01:35:35.32
It is, is it surprising that in those depths, we again found only human qualities which

1492
01:35:35.32 --> 01:35:42.08
in their very nature were a mixture of good and evil.

1493
01:35:42.08 --> 01:35:47.92
The rift dividing good from evil which goes through all human beings reaches into the

1494
01:35:47.92 --> 01:35:54.04
lowest depths and becomes apparent even on the bottom of the abyss which is laid open by

1495
01:35:54.04 --> 01:36:00.12
the concentration camp.

1496
01:36:00.12 --> 01:36:04.80
So we've got this idea once again that there's a dichotomy.

1497
01:36:04.80 --> 01:36:13.64
In people, in people, this dichotomy that you're capable of doing extreme good and you're

1498
01:36:13.64 --> 01:36:15.36
capable of doing extreme evil.

1499
01:36:15.36 --> 01:36:22.04
And we've seen it a bunch, we've seen it a bunch on this podcast.

1500
01:36:22.04 --> 01:36:24.72
You look at the mele i'masicker.

1501
01:36:24.72 --> 01:36:34.72
Those guys were normal guys that committed extreme evil straight up evil.

1502
01:36:34.72 --> 01:36:41.44
Normal guys that were, you know, four days earlier probably would have done something

1503
01:36:41.44 --> 01:36:44.68
heroic to save someone.

1504
01:36:44.68 --> 01:36:49.40
And here they are the other end of the spectrum.

1505
01:36:49.40 --> 01:36:56.68
And I think that you have to, we have to face that not only individually do you have that,

1506
01:36:56.68 --> 01:37:00.28
but then obviously as the group you have that, as a group of human beings, we have that

1507
01:37:00.28 --> 01:37:01.28
capability.

1508
01:37:01.28 --> 01:37:02.52
We've seen it over and over again.

1509
01:37:02.52 --> 01:37:05.84
If you want to know what that good part is, you got to know what that darkness is

1510
01:37:05.84 --> 01:37:06.84
to.

1511
01:37:06.84 --> 01:37:11.40
Yeah, the group thing is interesting.

1512
01:37:11.40 --> 01:37:15.20
You know, you know, you always hear not always, but you hear sometimes about these riots

1513
01:37:15.20 --> 01:37:20.64
on college campuses, whether it be after a game or something like that.

1514
01:37:20.64 --> 01:37:25.84
But at a glance, you think dang is this college full of just whole guns?

1515
01:37:25.84 --> 01:37:29.16
Like if this bit like you dry it, you know, but it's that.

1516
01:37:29.16 --> 01:37:33.44
It's like as an individual or, you know, under a quote unquote normal circumstances,

1517
01:37:33.44 --> 01:37:35.08
they just, they're just normal people.

1518
01:37:35.08 --> 01:37:38.56
You know, guys girls, whatever, they're just normal people.

1519
01:37:38.56 --> 01:37:43.32
But then you put them in this particular situation in some way extreme or whatever, you know,

1520
01:37:43.32 --> 01:37:44.32
it's a spectrum.

1521
01:37:44.32 --> 01:37:46.52
But, and they just act different.

1522
01:37:46.52 --> 01:37:49.40
And the whole group dynamic to this act different.

1523
01:37:49.40 --> 01:37:54.76
The group dynamic is a, is it can be a very, very scary thing.

1524
01:37:54.76 --> 01:37:58.12
There's no doubt it can be a very, very scary thing.

1525
01:37:58.12 --> 01:38:02.44
And that's why, you know, even when he's talking about, and I mentioned this on when

1526
01:38:02.44 --> 01:38:08.28
I was on Joe Rogan's last podcast and this idea of individual freedom and acting as an individual

1527
01:38:08.28 --> 01:38:16.24
is so important as to structure your life around to say, look, I'm not part of this group.

1528
01:38:16.24 --> 01:38:17.44
Your group is not me.

1529
01:38:17.44 --> 01:38:18.44
Yeah.

1530
01:38:18.44 --> 01:38:19.44
This group is not me.

1531
01:38:19.44 --> 01:38:21.24
They don't represent me.

1532
01:38:21.24 --> 01:38:22.24
I represent me.

1533
01:38:22.24 --> 01:38:23.24
Exactly.

1534
01:38:23.24 --> 01:38:26.20
And I have my own individual choices.

1535
01:38:26.20 --> 01:38:31.16
And that's what he's saying in here, the minute you give away to the herd, that's when

1536
01:38:31.16 --> 01:38:34.28
you start going, you don't know, you're, you don't longer control it.

1537
01:38:34.28 --> 01:38:35.28
Yeah.

1538
01:38:35.28 --> 01:38:37.40
And when you give up that control, that's a scary, scary thing.

1539
01:38:37.40 --> 01:38:39.72
And that's when these evil things take place.

1540
01:38:39.72 --> 01:38:40.72
Yeah.

1541
01:38:40.72 --> 01:38:45.96
And that, once again, it's, it's like, it's easy to say now.

1542
01:38:45.96 --> 01:38:49.20
Because grouping yourself is actually a survival mechanism.

1543
01:38:49.20 --> 01:38:50.20
True.

1544
01:38:50.20 --> 01:38:53.92
So you, you know, it's not going to be just that you're not going to naturally just be an

1545
01:38:53.92 --> 01:38:58.64
individual and act like an individual and conduct yourself in all these extreme situations

1546
01:38:58.64 --> 01:38:59.64
as an individual.

1547
01:38:59.64 --> 01:39:01.84
You're not just going to naturally do that.

1548
01:39:01.84 --> 01:39:02.84
True.

1549
01:39:02.84 --> 01:39:05.20
So I guess it just helps to know these things.

1550
01:39:05.20 --> 01:39:09.56
Well, that's, you're, you're a hundred percent right on both facets.

1551
01:39:09.56 --> 01:39:10.56
Number one, yes.

1552
01:39:10.56 --> 01:39:15.000
Grouping and fitting in is a survival instinct that people have.

1553
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.20
And that's why trends happen.

1554
01:39:17.20 --> 01:39:19.04
And that's why nations happen.

1555
01:39:19.04 --> 01:39:23.88
And that's why that's why groups occur in people.

1556
01:39:23.88 --> 01:39:24.88
And politics.

1557
01:39:24.88 --> 01:39:27.12
Yeah, politics and everything, right?

1558
01:39:27.12 --> 01:39:28.12
The, these groups.

1559
01:39:28.12 --> 01:39:31.40
And I mean, it's weird now because with the internet, you can have groups.

1560
01:39:31.40 --> 01:39:32.40
You can be part of these groups.

1561
01:39:32.40 --> 01:39:33.40
Yeah.

1562
01:39:33.40 --> 01:39:35.40
But honestly, yeah, whatever group you want.

1563
01:39:35.40 --> 01:39:37.64
And you can connect with all these different people.

1564
01:39:37.64 --> 01:39:45.36
But it's also important to make sure that you do remember that you are an individual.

1565
01:39:45.36 --> 01:39:53.36
Man, you can't, that you don't want to give up that last shred of human will to decide

1566
01:39:53.36 --> 01:39:54.88
what your attitude is going to be.

1567
01:39:54.88 --> 01:39:55.88
Yeah, dang.

1568
01:39:55.88 --> 01:40:02.44
And today, you know, in our luxurious society, if you can consciously navigate your waste

1569
01:40:02.44 --> 01:40:06.12
clear that of falling into the group trap, it's what it is.

1570
01:40:06.12 --> 01:40:07.12
It's a trap.

1571
01:40:07.12 --> 01:40:11.32
Because you don't have to, if you can do that successfully, but probably you won't

1572
01:40:11.32 --> 01:40:13.08
fall for the tricks, man.

1573
01:40:13.08 --> 01:40:14.08
Like that's the thing.

1574
01:40:14.08 --> 01:40:15.84
You get air, we all get tricked.

1575
01:40:15.84 --> 01:40:20.36
All the way down to just something is seemingly benign as marketing.

1576
01:40:20.36 --> 01:40:23.48
This man, you'll just fall for way less tricks.

1577
01:40:23.48 --> 01:40:25.64
You don't like those tricks out there in the world, do you?

1578
01:40:25.64 --> 01:40:27.64
No, I don't.

1579
01:40:27.64 --> 01:40:32.52
Probably fell for too many of them, I think.

1580
01:40:32.52 --> 01:40:34.48
This is a, I'm gonna wrap this book.

1581
01:40:34.48 --> 01:40:35.64
This book is not long.

1582
01:40:35.64 --> 01:40:37.20
It's a very fast read.

1583
01:40:37.20 --> 01:40:46.60
And actually, he goes into sort of goes into the more of the psychological, the psychiatrists,

1584
01:40:46.60 --> 01:40:52.04
the actual academic of it than I covered, but this is a fast read.

1585
01:40:52.04 --> 01:40:55.72
I mean, it's only 150 pages or so.

1586
01:40:55.72 --> 01:41:00.68
And you definitely get a raw look at, at human nature.

1587
01:41:00.68 --> 01:41:03.76
But this closing, I think, is very, very powerful.

1588
01:41:03.76 --> 01:41:10.92
Going back to the book, a human being is not one thing among others.

1589
01:41:10.92 --> 01:41:12.84
Things determine each other.

1590
01:41:12.84 --> 01:41:17.84
But man is ultimately self-determining.

1591
01:41:17.84 --> 01:41:23.60
What he becomes within the limits of endowment and environment.

1592
01:41:23.60 --> 01:41:27.40
He has made out of himself.

1593
01:41:27.40 --> 01:41:35.000
In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground,

1594
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:41.000
we watched in witness some of our comrades behave like swine.

1595
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.88
All others behave like saints.

1596
01:41:45.88 --> 01:41:56.84
Man has both potentialities within himself, which one is actualized depends on decisions,

1597
01:41:56.84 --> 01:42:01.56
but not on conditions.

1598
01:42:01.56 --> 01:42:09.04
Our generation is realistic for we have come to no man as he really is.

1599
01:42:09.04 --> 01:42:17.08
After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz.

1600
01:42:17.08 --> 01:42:25.88
However, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright with the Lord's

1601
01:42:25.88 --> 01:42:36.000
prayer, or the Shema Israel on his lips.

1602
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:50.40
And I think that thought that man has both potentialities within himself and we've seen

1603
01:42:50.40 --> 01:42:53.76
them over and over again.

1604
01:42:53.76 --> 01:43:01.36
These grand expanded potentialities in extreme display.

1605
01:43:01.36 --> 01:43:08.72
And we've talked about these situations in the podcast over and over again in the Burma

1606
01:43:08.72 --> 01:43:16.40
Railway that was built by the prisoners of war, and the prisoners of war were tortured and

1607
01:43:16.40 --> 01:43:21.40
killed by the Japanese and the genocide and a war in the rape of Nanking.

1608
01:43:21.40 --> 01:43:30.12
And we've also seen the other potentiality.

1609
01:43:30.12 --> 01:43:42.60
We've seen that over and over again that potentiality of goodness and of sacrifice.

1610
01:43:42.60 --> 01:43:51.72
Those men that we've seen over and over again that lay down their lives or for their brothers

1611
01:43:51.72 --> 01:43:58.36
and in doing so protect our freedom.

1612
01:43:58.36 --> 01:44:08.96
But it's important to note that again that whether the evil is actualized in the minds

1613
01:44:08.96 --> 01:44:18.12
of men that is not based on conditions but on decisions.

1614
01:44:18.12 --> 01:44:25.52
And this doesn't only apply to good evil, of course, that's the most expansive thought

1615
01:44:25.52 --> 01:44:31.04
that we can apply this to but it also applies to everything we choose to do or choose

1616
01:44:31.04 --> 01:44:40.32
not to do and everything we choose to become or not to become.

1617
01:44:40.32 --> 01:44:42.92
It's us.

1618
01:44:42.92 --> 01:44:51.000
It's our choice and we are responsible.

1619
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:58.40
We are responsible to be good instead of evil to be strong instead of weak to become what

1620
01:44:58.40 --> 01:45:06.40
we want to become not what we let ourselves become.

1621
01:45:06.40 --> 01:45:13.72
We own the course.

1622
01:45:13.72 --> 01:45:25.000
And with every decision that we make we actualize ourselves would become what we choose.

1623
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:35.40
Swine or saints.

1624
01:45:35.40 --> 01:45:49.56
So when you make decisions every decision think about where that decision leads and what

1625
01:45:49.56 --> 01:45:56.60
that decision will make you become.

1626
01:45:56.60 --> 01:46:06.28
And then self-determined.

1627
01:46:06.28 --> 01:46:12.60
What will make you a better person.

1628
01:46:12.60 --> 01:46:20.12
And even in situations where you feel you have no choice at all, you still have one last

1629
01:46:20.12 --> 01:46:31.88
freedom and that is to choose your own attitude in any given set of circumstances.

1630
01:46:31.88 --> 01:46:36.76
Keep that choice.

1631
01:46:36.76 --> 01:46:42.84
Keep that freedom that hard choice.

1632
01:46:42.84 --> 01:46:49.04
The disciplined choice.

1633
01:46:49.04 --> 01:47:02.80
With the discipline to make the right choice maintain your freedom.

1634
01:47:02.80 --> 01:47:19.72
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1635
01:47:19.72 --> 01:47:20.72
Is it an crazy home?

1636
01:47:20.72 --> 01:47:22.88
I can't help but think of this.

1637
01:47:22.88 --> 01:47:31.60
Like where how they talk about the SS officers, the Nazis, the guys there who are just

1638
01:47:31.60 --> 01:47:32.60
savages.

1639
01:47:32.60 --> 01:47:37.28
Obviously, but are they really savages as people?

1640
01:47:37.28 --> 01:47:39.52
Or is it a circumstantial thing?

1641
01:47:39.52 --> 01:47:44.84
I know they're trained to regard the Jews or these groups of people as being any them and

1642
01:47:44.84 --> 01:47:47.36
all this stuff.

1643
01:47:47.36 --> 01:47:49.48
Are they savages as individuals?

1644
01:47:49.48 --> 01:47:52.20
Because it takes a savage to do some of this stuff.

1645
01:47:52.20 --> 01:47:58.36
Especially grabbing a baby and smashing his books and scolds against the wall.

1646
01:47:58.36 --> 01:48:01.56
That's subhuman behavior.

1647
01:48:01.56 --> 01:48:05.88
When he goes home, he has kids.

1648
01:48:05.88 --> 01:48:10.48
He's like, I don't care if these kids ultimately, if their heads get in, I'm sure he's

1649
01:48:10.48 --> 01:48:11.48
not like that.

1650
01:48:11.48 --> 01:48:15.64
I'm sure he's just a normal person who just be just as weak as all of us if your

1651
01:48:15.64 --> 01:48:19.48
kid stubs its toe and starts crying.

1652
01:48:19.48 --> 01:48:20.88
Yeah, well, we're going to explore.

1653
01:48:20.88 --> 01:48:25.72
I've got some books in the queue to explore the other side of this and they're very

1654
01:48:25.72 --> 01:48:27.68
revealing about some of that.

1655
01:48:27.68 --> 01:48:38.68
But again, it's you're right, that some of these guys were normal, right?

1656
01:48:38.68 --> 01:48:44.08
Some of these Nazis were normal and they were doing their job and that's one of the worst,

1657
01:48:44.08 --> 01:48:51.12
there's a whole argument on whether that even is allowable.

1658
01:48:51.12 --> 01:48:56.48
If you're doing your job and I'll tell you what, in the US military, that doesn't work.

1659
01:48:56.48 --> 01:48:58.16
That's an excuse that we don't have.

1660
01:48:58.16 --> 01:49:03.44
You can't say, hey, I got ordered to do this thing that was against the law or against ethical

1661
01:49:03.44 --> 01:49:05.04
values doesn't matter.

1662
01:49:05.04 --> 01:49:06.44
I still can't do it.

1663
01:49:06.44 --> 01:49:07.44
That's not an excuse.

1664
01:49:07.44 --> 01:49:11.56
And that came directly from this attitude that Nazi said, hey, I was just falling

1665
01:49:11.56 --> 01:49:12.56
orders.

1666
01:49:12.56 --> 01:49:13.72
Hey, what's my father's just falling orders?

1667
01:49:13.72 --> 01:49:15.12
No, actually, you can't say that.

1668
01:49:15.12 --> 01:49:16.80
You know, I'll have to say that.

1669
01:49:16.80 --> 01:49:22.56
So as far as the normalcy, sure, they might have been normal when they went home, but that

1670
01:49:22.56 --> 01:49:24.36
doesn't remove their guilt at all.

1671
01:49:24.36 --> 01:49:25.36
Yeah, fully.

1672
01:49:25.36 --> 01:49:28.44
You can't take a baby and smash it's head against the wall.

1673
01:49:28.44 --> 01:49:32.24
You don't get a pass on that one, whether you ordered to do it or not.

1674
01:49:32.24 --> 01:49:36.72
There's certain moral standards that exist and you can't violate them.

1675
01:49:36.72 --> 01:49:37.92
And if you do, you're guilty.

1676
01:49:37.92 --> 01:49:39.60
It doesn't matter what else you did.

1677
01:49:39.60 --> 01:49:45.08
Back then, who was kind of the authority on that?

1678
01:49:45.08 --> 01:49:48.12
Where the moral was it like a global thing?

1679
01:49:48.12 --> 01:49:52.76
Or is it because obviously Hitler would be like, hey, whatever?

1680
01:49:52.76 --> 01:49:56.88
Well, there's different societies that had different viewpoints.

1681
01:49:56.88 --> 01:50:04.04
Obviously, and not to, hence the war, the Nazis and the Japanese both felt, okay, we can

1682
01:50:04.04 --> 01:50:06.40
do what we need to do to dominate.

1683
01:50:06.40 --> 01:50:10.28
And whether that's the rap and an king or whether that's the concentration camps and the

1684
01:50:10.28 --> 01:50:14.44
final solution, both those things were in their societies.

1685
01:50:14.44 --> 01:50:18.64
Now there was, of course, there was people inside those societies.

1686
01:50:18.64 --> 01:50:21.32
I don't know, I don't know of any Japanese.

1687
01:50:21.32 --> 01:50:23.36
I'm sure there were some Japanese that were against them.

1688
01:50:23.36 --> 01:50:27.44
And even when we'd read the rap and an king, there was a Nazi in an an king, remember

1689
01:50:27.44 --> 01:50:29.08
that sheltered people.

1690
01:50:29.08 --> 01:50:30.64
So there's an example.

1691
01:50:30.64 --> 01:50:31.64
Here's a guy now.

1692
01:50:31.64 --> 01:50:36.20
He didn't know what was going on with the final solution back in Germany.

1693
01:50:36.20 --> 01:50:38.84
At least it doesn't appear that way.

1694
01:50:38.84 --> 01:50:46.52
But yeah, this is what makes morality and ethical decision making so challenging.

1695
01:50:46.52 --> 01:50:52.20
But there is, in my opinion, you know, a certain standard moral code that human beings

1696
01:50:52.20 --> 01:50:54.04
live by.

1697
01:50:54.04 --> 01:51:00.24
And that is a universal, relatively, you know, now there's now a lot of people.

1698
01:51:00.24 --> 01:51:01.68
I should actually say it's universal.

1699
01:51:01.68 --> 01:51:06.16
There's the way that I believe that there's morals and standards that human beings

1700
01:51:06.16 --> 01:51:07.16
live by.

1701
01:51:07.16 --> 01:51:12.36
And when you start stepping outside those bounds, you're going on the wrong side.

1702
01:51:12.36 --> 01:51:15.84
Yeah, and like anything, man, it's like obviously a spectrum.

1703
01:51:15.84 --> 01:51:19.56
And then what you're talking about that universal line that you cross, it's actually

1704
01:51:19.56 --> 01:51:23.84
when you really look at the line, it's like a universal gray area of, and then you really

1705
01:51:23.84 --> 01:51:25.08
look closer.

1706
01:51:25.08 --> 01:51:31.36
But I think that the circumstances don't really fall within the confines of that gray area

1707
01:51:31.36 --> 01:51:32.36
very often.

1708
01:51:32.36 --> 01:51:34.92
So it's easy to be like, that's obviously right.

1709
01:51:34.92 --> 01:51:35.92
That's obviously wrong.

1710
01:51:35.92 --> 01:51:39.04
But then everyone's in all these gray areas of emergent.

1711
01:51:39.04 --> 01:51:41.68
And it's like this big debate and it depends on who you are.

1712
01:51:41.68 --> 01:51:42.68
Yeah.

1713
01:51:42.68 --> 01:51:45.40
I don't spend a lot of time in the gray areas to be honest with you.

1714
01:51:45.40 --> 01:51:47.92
Like in my fall pattern, I don't spend a lot of time in the gray areas.

1715
01:51:47.92 --> 01:51:50.80
I spend time because to me, it is pretty obvious.

1716
01:51:50.80 --> 01:51:57.44
Like when you're ISIS and you're systematically raping 12 year old girls and boys, you

1717
01:51:57.44 --> 01:51:58.76
don't get to live.

1718
01:51:58.76 --> 01:51:59.76
That doesn't work.

1719
01:51:59.76 --> 01:52:00.76
Yeah.

1720
01:52:00.76 --> 01:52:02.76
That's not part of my deal over here.

1721
01:52:02.76 --> 01:52:03.76
You die.

1722
01:52:03.76 --> 01:52:08.04
And when you take people and you put them in cages and you burn them to death, you don't

1723
01:52:08.04 --> 01:52:09.28
get to do that.

1724
01:52:09.28 --> 01:52:12.88
Like these Nazis that are putting people in the context, you don't get to do that.

1725
01:52:12.88 --> 01:52:13.88
No.

1726
01:52:13.88 --> 01:52:16.24
We go to war, we fight, and we win.

1727
01:52:16.24 --> 01:52:17.64
That's the way it works.

1728
01:52:17.64 --> 01:52:21.64
Now these gray areas that you're talking about, I don't mess around in those gray areas.

1729
01:52:21.64 --> 01:52:22.64
Yeah.

1730
01:52:22.64 --> 01:52:26.52
I think there's too much, there's turbulence in there.

1731
01:52:26.52 --> 01:52:31.08
And a lot of times you look at it from the outside and it's hard to tell what it is.

1732
01:52:31.08 --> 01:52:33.04
What it actually is happening in there.

1733
01:52:33.04 --> 01:52:34.04
Right?

1734
01:52:34.04 --> 01:52:36.44
I'll, and maybe that's not the best policy.

1735
01:52:36.44 --> 01:52:41.08
But I won't escalate something personally until I see it go outside the lines of what

1736
01:52:41.08 --> 01:52:42.08
I deem to be.

1737
01:52:42.08 --> 01:52:43.08
Okay.

1738
01:52:43.08 --> 01:52:44.08
Yeah.

1739
01:52:44.08 --> 01:52:45.32
Once you get outside those lines, you're done.

1740
01:52:45.32 --> 01:52:51.76
Well, thankfully you're, you know, a little bit smart in a way where, you know, whether

1741
01:52:51.76 --> 01:52:55.80
you name these things or not, there's always a particular standard that you go by, you

1742
01:52:55.80 --> 01:52:56.80
know.

1743
01:52:56.80 --> 01:53:01.20
So just like the difference between killing someone and when someone says murder, you

1744
01:53:01.20 --> 01:53:04.20
know, murder is clearly defined.

1745
01:53:04.20 --> 01:53:11.20
So if you murder someone, like killing someone is this broad thing, you kill them accidentally

1746
01:53:11.20 --> 01:53:13.60
killed them, you killed them after planning.

1747
01:53:13.60 --> 01:53:14.60
Yeah.

1748
01:53:14.60 --> 01:53:15.60
There's a million.

1749
01:53:15.60 --> 01:53:18.96
The revenge and all that, you know, that's killing someone, but murder is defined.

1750
01:53:18.96 --> 01:53:24.80
You know, so, well, somebody asked me when I, I would attempt for a second time and

1751
01:53:24.80 --> 01:53:28.92
someone asked me something along the lines of, well, who defines these rules, which is

1752
01:53:28.92 --> 01:53:30.52
basically what you just asked me.

1753
01:53:30.52 --> 01:53:33.72
And I think it actually, there is an answer to who defines these rules in warfare.

1754
01:53:33.72 --> 01:53:34.72
It's the law of armed conflict.

1755
01:53:34.72 --> 01:53:36.16
It's like a Geneva convention.

1756
01:53:36.16 --> 01:53:37.16
We follow those laws.

1757
01:53:37.16 --> 01:53:38.16
Right.

1758
01:53:38.16 --> 01:53:39.80
They're very clearly defined what you can and can't do.

1759
01:53:39.80 --> 01:53:40.80
That's it.

1760
01:53:40.80 --> 01:53:41.80
Next question.

1761
01:53:41.80 --> 01:53:42.80
Yeah.

1762
01:53:42.80 --> 01:53:46.40
And I mean, unless you straight up disagree with the Geneva convention, you know, and

1763
01:53:46.40 --> 01:53:50.60
because of your personal moral code, but as long as you have again, a standard that you're

1764
01:53:50.60 --> 01:53:53.80
going by that'll reduce the gray areas by a lot.

1765
01:53:53.80 --> 01:53:58.04
And still, we're going to be there, but it's easier to operate in black and white when

1766
01:53:58.04 --> 01:53:59.04
you have standards.

1767
01:53:59.04 --> 01:54:03.68
And it won't always be easy, but, you know, it's like, well, let me, let me, let me,

1768
01:54:03.68 --> 01:54:04.68
let me do this.

1769
01:54:04.68 --> 01:54:06.68
This, this, when we start getting in the gray area, and you're sitting here saying,

1770
01:54:06.68 --> 01:54:09.28
that I'm all black and white, and that's, I'm actually saying that.

1771
01:54:09.28 --> 01:54:10.84
Like, okay, I want you across this line.

1772
01:54:10.84 --> 01:54:11.84
But guess what?

1773
01:54:11.84 --> 01:54:13.12
Those lines can get blurry too.

1774
01:54:13.12 --> 01:54:19.52
Yeah, because I heard about a guy that was on a documentary who is, he was, he was

1775
01:54:19.52 --> 01:54:23.08
a Western journalist of some kind, and I got to watch this documentary, I'm sure someone

1776
01:54:23.08 --> 01:54:24.08
will tell us what it is.

1777
01:54:24.08 --> 01:54:25.76
But somebody else told me about it.

1778
01:54:25.76 --> 01:54:33.16
The Western journalist, he's embedded with insurgence in Iraq.

1779
01:54:33.16 --> 01:54:34.70
And he's filming.

1780
01:54:34.70 --> 01:54:37.24
And we're going out in attacking coalition forces.

1781
01:54:37.24 --> 01:54:38.24
Yeah.

1782
01:54:38.24 --> 01:54:39.24
Right.

1783
01:54:39.24 --> 01:54:42.96
And I guess he was, while he's doing it, you know, he's trying to get a story

1784
01:54:42.96 --> 01:54:46.40
and do his job, but then all of a sudden they're attacking coalition forces, right?

1785
01:54:46.40 --> 01:54:47.40
Now there's a gray area.

1786
01:54:47.40 --> 01:54:52.52
Now let's say, if you want to take that example to the extreme, if we're in a fire

1787
01:54:52.52 --> 01:54:58.72
fight, and I see a guy with a camera who's wearing a press badge following an insurgent.

1788
01:54:58.72 --> 01:54:59.72
Right.

1789
01:54:59.72 --> 01:55:02.96
I mean, I think I'm going to work out good for him.

1790
01:55:02.96 --> 01:55:06.72
Because it's not like I'm going to say, okay, well, you know, he's clearly with insurgents.

1791
01:55:06.72 --> 01:55:12.16
But what I'm saying is that's, that's one example of many that that you could get into,

1792
01:55:12.16 --> 01:55:16.76
where also another thing that happened in Iraq a lot was people change sides.

1793
01:55:16.76 --> 01:55:19.76
And then went from supporting the terrorist, to supporting the coalition, and then back

1794
01:55:19.76 --> 01:55:21.24
again, and then back again.

1795
01:55:21.24 --> 01:55:26.04
So how do you balance those?

1796
01:55:26.04 --> 01:55:31.08
And I'll tell you how I balance them was how can we achieve our mission?

1797
01:55:31.08 --> 01:55:34.36
And that sounds like one of those, hey, mission focus.

1798
01:55:34.36 --> 01:55:35.36
But it's true.

1799
01:55:35.36 --> 01:55:41.88
I look at, okay, this guy, you know, a year ago was being targeted by coalition forces

1800
01:55:41.88 --> 01:55:43.80
for being a bad guy.

1801
01:55:43.80 --> 01:55:46.04
Now he has changed course.

1802
01:55:46.04 --> 01:55:47.04
So what am I supposed to do?

1803
01:55:47.04 --> 01:55:48.04
Still prosecute him?

1804
01:55:48.04 --> 01:55:50.44
Or is he going to help us achieve our mission of overall victory?

1805
01:55:50.44 --> 01:55:52.04
I guess what I'm going to do?

1806
01:55:52.04 --> 01:55:57.76
I'm going to cut him some moral slack because we're going to win.

1807
01:55:57.76 --> 01:55:59.16
So those are hard things to.

1808
01:55:59.16 --> 01:56:00.32
But that's exactly what I mean.

1809
01:56:00.32 --> 01:56:06.08
They'll see the standard in your case became the overall mission.

1810
01:56:06.08 --> 01:56:07.08
Yes.

1811
01:56:07.08 --> 01:56:09.56
So you know, you have that saying it's not like just some guy floating down the road

1812
01:56:09.56 --> 01:56:12.44
through life being like, I don't feel good about that right there.

1813
01:56:12.44 --> 01:56:13.44
So I feel this way.

1814
01:56:13.44 --> 01:56:14.44
So I'm going to do it.

1815
01:56:14.44 --> 01:56:17.36
It's not that it's like the standard very concrete attached to it.

1816
01:56:17.36 --> 01:56:18.36
Still great areas.

1817
01:56:18.36 --> 01:56:20.80
Gunny emerged, but like I said, it just reduces that great area.

1818
01:56:20.80 --> 01:56:21.80
Yep.

1819
01:56:21.80 --> 01:56:26.16
And then the bottom line is, this is why leadership is hard.

1820
01:56:26.16 --> 01:56:27.16
Yes.

1821
01:56:27.16 --> 01:56:31.72
So the whole idea of leadership, whether it's in combat or whether it's in the business

1822
01:56:31.72 --> 01:56:34.48
world or whether it's part of a team or whether it's part of a family or whether it's

1823
01:56:34.48 --> 01:56:38.20
in a concentration camp or whether it's in a prisoner of war camp.

1824
01:56:38.20 --> 01:56:39.68
Leadership is hard.

1825
01:56:39.68 --> 01:56:45.000
There's gray areas like when Captain Plum was saying, hey, he got told an order, you

1826
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.84
know, make communications with this guy at all costs.

1827
01:56:49.84 --> 01:56:50.84
At all costs.

1828
01:56:50.84 --> 01:56:54.56
That means I'm going to get beaten and tortured and died by the guards to get this guy

1829
01:56:54.56 --> 01:56:55.56
this piece of communication.

1830
01:56:55.56 --> 01:56:57.12
Is he going to follow that?

1831
01:56:57.12 --> 01:56:58.12
Yes.

1832
01:56:58.12 --> 01:56:59.28
No.

1833
01:56:59.28 --> 01:57:00.80
He had to make a judgment.

1834
01:57:00.80 --> 01:57:03.36
And so you know what, though that doesn't make sense.

1835
01:57:03.36 --> 01:57:04.84
That doesn't make sense.

1836
01:57:04.84 --> 01:57:07.36
So this gray area that went outside the bounds of the gray area.

1837
01:57:07.36 --> 01:57:09.40
And he said, no, I'll do my best.

1838
01:57:09.40 --> 01:57:16.04
I understand that it's critical, but I'm going to stay within me staying alive.

1839
01:57:16.04 --> 01:57:17.28
Right?

1840
01:57:17.28 --> 01:57:20.04
So that is what makes leadership hard.

1841
01:57:20.04 --> 01:57:25.40
Is you have to constantly make these decisions where there's their gray area and you're

1842
01:57:25.40 --> 01:57:26.40
doing your best.

1843
01:57:26.40 --> 01:57:30.92
And that's, that's again, to me it was always, I love that.

1844
01:57:30.92 --> 01:57:32.08
I love that about leadership.

1845
01:57:32.08 --> 01:57:34.16
I love weighing those decisions out.

1846
01:57:34.16 --> 01:57:37.56
And I love discussing them with my guys up and down the chain of command and saying, hey,

1847
01:57:37.56 --> 01:57:38.56
here's where we're at.

1848
01:57:38.56 --> 01:57:39.92
Let me tell you exactly where we're at.

1849
01:57:39.92 --> 01:57:41.64
You know, I'll use life.

1850
01:57:41.64 --> 01:57:43.44
I'll be, you know, life here's what's going on.

1851
01:57:43.44 --> 01:57:44.44
This is the situation.

1852
01:57:44.44 --> 01:57:45.44
What do you think?

1853
01:57:45.44 --> 01:57:46.44
Yeah.

1854
01:57:46.44 --> 01:57:47.44
Well, I think that's okay.

1855
01:57:47.44 --> 01:57:48.44
That's a good point.

1856
01:57:48.44 --> 01:57:49.44
But did you think about that?

1857
01:57:49.44 --> 01:57:50.44
Oh, that's a good one.

1858
01:57:50.44 --> 01:57:51.44
You know what I mean?

1859
01:57:51.44 --> 01:57:52.44
We're going to have those conversations.

1860
01:57:52.44 --> 01:57:56.36
And I had never had any problem opening my mind up to these various opinions that people had.

1861
01:57:56.36 --> 01:58:03.20
And I think as a leader, that's a huge piece of building trust up and down the chain of

1862
01:58:03.20 --> 01:58:06.44
command is when you have an open mind to discuss things with people.

1863
01:58:06.44 --> 01:58:12.80
And that also double gravitational pull echo Charles helps you build the relationship.

1864
01:58:12.80 --> 01:58:13.80
Yeah.

1865
01:58:13.80 --> 01:58:15.84
Helps you build the relationship and helps you say, oh, you know what?

1866
01:58:15.84 --> 01:58:18.32
Like, what's the minute I'm in there and I'm talking to him like, hey, I got we got

1867
01:58:18.32 --> 01:58:19.32
a gray area here.

1868
01:58:19.32 --> 01:58:24.28
You know, we got a customer that is threatening to put us on the help, but we didn't do

1869
01:58:24.28 --> 01:58:25.28
anything wrong.

1870
01:58:25.28 --> 01:58:27.88
How do you think we should handle it?

1871
01:58:27.88 --> 01:58:28.88
Okay.

1872
01:58:28.88 --> 01:58:32.92
Well, you think we should just tell him, go ahead and put it on Yelp.

1873
01:58:32.92 --> 01:58:35.56
We don't care and we'll go to Yelp and we'll talk to him.

1874
01:58:35.56 --> 01:58:36.92
That might be the good answer.

1875
01:58:36.92 --> 01:58:40.84
But also it might be good to say, bro, wait, why are you so mad?

1876
01:58:40.84 --> 01:58:41.84
Customer?

1877
01:58:41.84 --> 01:58:42.84
Let's talk.

1878
01:58:42.84 --> 01:58:43.84
Hey, we want to refund you.

1879
01:58:43.84 --> 01:58:46.04
We want to take care of you because our customers are important to us.

1880
01:58:46.04 --> 01:58:47.60
Maybe you'll give us a positive thing on you.

1881
01:58:47.60 --> 01:58:48.60
You know what I'm saying?

1882
01:58:48.60 --> 01:58:49.84
There's all this gray area.

1883
01:58:49.84 --> 01:58:50.84
Yeah.

1884
01:58:50.84 --> 01:58:53.88
And if you have an open mind to discuss things with your team.

1885
01:58:53.88 --> 01:58:55.52
Open down the chain of command.

1886
01:58:55.52 --> 01:58:58.52
You know what you'll do is you'll get in that gray area.

1887
01:58:58.52 --> 01:59:00.52
You'll start to get clarity.

1888
01:59:00.52 --> 01:59:03.88
You'll start to get clarity and you'll start to see better.

1889
01:59:03.88 --> 01:59:12.60
And you can move through the gray area without being without being so decisive that in a gray

1890
01:59:12.60 --> 01:59:14.84
area, you don't know if it's black or white, right?

1891
01:59:14.84 --> 01:59:18.60
So if you decide as the leader, I'm going black.

1892
01:59:18.60 --> 01:59:19.60
Going black.

1893
01:59:19.60 --> 01:59:22.64
Then when the gray area clears up, it was white that you should have gone with.

1894
01:59:22.64 --> 01:59:23.64
Yeah.

1895
01:59:23.64 --> 01:59:24.64
You don't need to do that.

1896
01:59:24.64 --> 01:59:27.20
In many cases, you can say, okay, I'm going to lean a little bit towards the black

1897
01:59:27.20 --> 01:59:28.20
because that's what I'm feeling.

1898
01:59:28.20 --> 01:59:30.68
And then all of a sudden you start moving there and you start seeing that, no, this

1899
01:59:30.68 --> 01:59:32.20
is going to be a white decision.

1900
01:59:32.20 --> 01:59:33.20
Yeah.

1901
01:59:33.20 --> 01:59:34.20
Okay, I can recover from that.

1902
01:59:34.20 --> 01:59:38.60
I can move backwards and repair what decision was made.

1903
01:59:38.60 --> 01:59:42.16
And the best way to do that is say, hey, guys, here's the situation.

1904
01:59:42.16 --> 01:59:44.84
I thought that black was going to be the right decision.

1905
01:59:44.84 --> 01:59:46.000
I started leaning in that direction.

1906
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:47.88
I was wrong.

1907
01:59:47.88 --> 01:59:52.32
Now I see that white is the right answer and we're going with white.

1908
01:59:52.32 --> 01:59:54.68
Does anyone have any questions about that?

1909
01:59:54.68 --> 01:59:56.64
Does everyone understand why I did that?

1910
01:59:56.64 --> 01:59:57.64
Oh, you don't understand why?

1911
01:59:57.64 --> 01:59:58.64
Let me explain it to you.

1912
01:59:58.64 --> 01:59:59.64
Here's what I thought.

1913
01:59:59.64 --> 02:00:00.64
Here's what I saw.

1914
02:00:00.64 --> 02:00:02.28
Next time, do you want me to wet contact you?

1915
02:00:02.28 --> 02:00:03.84
So you could, that's what I'm talking about.

1916
02:00:03.84 --> 02:00:06.88
And by the way, when I'm doing that, I'm building relationships with my team, which is

1917
02:00:06.88 --> 02:00:08.64
what I want to do.

1918
02:00:08.64 --> 02:00:10.92
I just was talking to leader the other day.

1919
02:00:10.92 --> 02:00:12.68
And I told him and reiterated something.

1920
02:00:12.68 --> 02:00:14.40
I'm saying, over and over again.

1921
02:00:14.40 --> 02:00:19.000
But people that did things for me and the teams that were in the Army, the Marine Corps,

1922
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:22.28
in the SEAL teams, in my platoon, up and down the chain of command, doesn't matter.

1923
02:00:22.28 --> 02:00:24.76
99.9% of it.

1924
02:00:24.76 --> 02:00:28.36
Wasn't because I had some kind of rank or privilege over them.

1925
02:00:28.36 --> 02:00:31.04
It was always because I had a good relationship with people.

1926
02:00:31.04 --> 02:00:34.92
And when you build that good relationship with people, that's what it's all about.

1927
02:00:34.92 --> 02:00:36.96
Then they do things for you.

1928
02:00:36.96 --> 02:00:37.96
And you know what?

1929
02:00:37.96 --> 02:00:39.40
You do things for them, too.

1930
02:00:39.40 --> 02:00:42.48
It's not a one way street that I'm talking about, because you won't build any relationships

1931
02:00:42.48 --> 02:00:43.76
if you're building a one way street.

1932
02:00:43.76 --> 02:00:47.36
No one's going to be your friend after you just take advantage of them over and over again.

1933
02:00:47.36 --> 02:00:51.92
Like those people that call you only when they need something from you.

1934
02:00:51.92 --> 02:00:56.04
Now I actually don't have a problem with that, because I don't communicate with a lot of people.

1935
02:00:56.04 --> 02:01:00.36
I communicate on social media with a bunch of different people.

1936
02:01:00.36 --> 02:01:01.36
They'll get you there too.

1937
02:01:01.36 --> 02:01:06.52
But as far as, if, like, when one of my buddies calls me up and says, hey, I need this favor.

1938
02:01:06.52 --> 02:01:08.000
I'm like, cool, on it.

1939
02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.16
I haven't talked to him for nine months.

1940
02:01:10.16 --> 02:01:12.56
He's only calling me because he needs something from me.

1941
02:01:12.56 --> 02:01:13.56
Doesn't matter.

1942
02:01:13.56 --> 02:01:15.64
People do that with me all the time and it's cool.

1943
02:01:15.64 --> 02:01:16.84
Now it's in a big group of people.

1944
02:01:16.84 --> 02:01:20.000
It's like six people in the world.

1945
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.76
And those same six people, they don't call the wish me happy birthday.

1946
02:01:22.76 --> 02:01:27.32
They don't call them tell me, you know, Merry Christmas.

1947
02:01:27.32 --> 02:01:30.000
They call me up and say, hey, I need this from you.

1948
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Can you do it?

1949
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:32.36
I'm like, got it.

1950
02:01:32.36 --> 02:01:33.36
No factor.

1951
02:01:33.36 --> 02:01:35.92
Do you even have a birthday negative?

1952
02:01:35.92 --> 02:01:37.36
I have a maybe factor in the day.

1953
02:01:37.36 --> 02:01:39.92
So funny.

1954
02:01:39.92 --> 02:01:44.88
I'm just trying to imagine someone calling you to wish you have a birthday.

1955
02:01:44.88 --> 02:01:48.40
I mean, maybe like your wife was at awkward when I got in the civilian sector and people

1956
02:01:48.40 --> 02:01:50.40
would be like, when's your birthday?

1957
02:01:50.40 --> 02:01:51.40
I'm going to be like, why won't you?

1958
02:01:51.40 --> 02:01:52.40
What are you talking about?

1959
02:01:52.40 --> 02:01:54.40
Why are you trying to get my personal information?

1960
02:01:54.40 --> 02:01:55.40
I'm going to attack you.

1961
02:01:55.40 --> 02:01:58.40
Yeah.

1962
02:01:58.40 --> 02:02:00.40
Hey, what's the inner you?

1963
02:02:00.40 --> 02:02:01.40
No.

1964
02:02:01.40 --> 02:02:02.40
You know, that's the thing.

1965
02:02:02.40 --> 02:02:05.40
What was the other funny thing about the birthday deal?

1966
02:02:05.40 --> 02:02:06.40
Well, that's a getting present.

1967
02:02:06.40 --> 02:02:08.40
I'm not good with presents.

1968
02:02:08.40 --> 02:02:09.40
Yeah, man.

1969
02:02:09.40 --> 02:02:10.40
But don't get me any presents.

1970
02:02:10.40 --> 02:02:11.40
Right.

1971
02:02:11.40 --> 02:02:12.40
Because I don't want what you got me.

1972
02:02:12.40 --> 02:02:13.40
Yeah.

1973
02:02:13.40 --> 02:02:15.40
If I want something I already have to get it.

1974
02:02:15.40 --> 02:02:16.40
Yeah.

1975
02:02:16.40 --> 02:02:19.40
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to be appreciated.

1976
02:02:19.40 --> 02:02:22.40
There's a one gift that my wife got me one time.

1977
02:02:22.40 --> 02:02:27.40
And I haven't, I've been thinking about why I haven't talked about this particular whole situation.

1978
02:02:27.40 --> 02:02:29.40
And that's, there's a band called the white stripes.

1979
02:02:29.40 --> 02:02:30.40
Sure.

1980
02:02:30.40 --> 02:02:31.40
Light stripes.

1981
02:02:31.40 --> 02:02:32.40
And the white stripes.

1982
02:02:32.40 --> 02:02:34.40
Jack white, Meg white.

1983
02:02:34.40 --> 02:02:36.40
The white stripes are awesome.

1984
02:02:36.40 --> 02:02:38.40
They're an awesome band.

1985
02:02:38.40 --> 02:02:41.40
And there's so many layers with the white stripes.

1986
02:02:41.40 --> 02:02:44.40
The first of all, there's, I'll tell you two layers that I love about the white stripes.

1987
02:02:44.40 --> 02:02:53.40
Number one, all their clothing, guitars, drums, keyboards, everything that they have on stage.

1988
02:02:53.40 --> 02:02:59.40
And everything that they have on their record albums, everything that they have is either red, black, or white.

1989
02:02:59.40 --> 02:03:01.40
On all the records since day one.

1990
02:03:01.40 --> 02:03:02.40
That's number one.

1991
02:03:02.40 --> 02:03:11.40
Number two, they only have three sounds in any other songs at any one time.

1992
02:03:11.40 --> 02:03:15.40
So those three sounds could be drums, vocals, guitar.

1993
02:03:15.40 --> 02:03:18.40
They could be drums, keyboards, vocals.

1994
02:03:18.40 --> 02:03:21.40
They could be keyboards, guitar, vocals.

1995
02:03:21.40 --> 02:03:23.40
But they only have three sounds at any one time.

1996
02:03:23.40 --> 02:03:24.40
Vocals is one of the songs.

1997
02:03:24.40 --> 02:03:25.40
Oh, this is one of the songs.

1998
02:03:25.40 --> 02:03:25.40
Yeah.

1999
02:03:25.40 --> 02:03:27.40
There's only two people in the band.

2000
02:03:27.40 --> 02:03:31.40
Anyways, the white stripes is an awesome band.

2001
02:03:31.40 --> 02:03:35.40
And my wife bought me tickets to go see the white stripes.

2002
02:03:35.40 --> 02:03:37.40
Now, I didn't even think about.

2003
02:03:37.40 --> 02:03:39.40
I never pay attention to when bands are playing or whatever.

2004
02:03:39.40 --> 02:03:45.40
So my, I was, I was, I don't use this term very often, but I was overjoyed.

2005
02:03:45.40 --> 02:03:48.40
That she got me tickets to the white stripes.

2006
02:03:48.40 --> 02:03:50.40
I was so stoked.

2007
02:03:50.40 --> 02:03:54.40
And then Meg White had some issues.

2008
02:03:54.40 --> 02:03:56.40
And they canceled the whole tour and they never played again.

2009
02:03:56.40 --> 02:03:59.40
They were like a couple weeks away from being in San Diego.

2010
02:03:59.40 --> 02:04:00.40
Where I was going to go see the white stripes.

2011
02:04:00.40 --> 02:04:03.40
So the question is, ultimately, ultimately,

2012
02:04:03.40 --> 02:04:04.40
Grand scheme of things.

2013
02:04:04.40 --> 02:04:06.40
Was that a good gift to give, Joko?

2014
02:04:06.40 --> 02:04:08.40
That was an awesome gift to give me.

2015
02:04:08.40 --> 02:04:11.40
So it was, it was the thought that counts in this case.

2016
02:04:11.40 --> 02:04:13.40
It was a beautiful thought.

2017
02:04:13.40 --> 02:04:16.40
And I was, and I couldn't believe she thought of it.

2018
02:04:16.40 --> 02:04:20.40
Because normally it's like, oh, you got me a sweater from some story that I hate.

2019
02:04:20.40 --> 02:04:24.40
No, I'm really hard to shop for.

2020
02:04:24.40 --> 02:04:26.40
I'm really, if I want something, I have it.

2021
02:04:26.40 --> 02:04:28.40
And I don't want that much.

2022
02:04:28.40 --> 02:04:30.40
So it's like, oh, I want something I have it.

2023
02:04:30.40 --> 02:04:33.40
Like once every 18 months, I want something.

2024
02:04:33.40 --> 02:04:35.40
And then I get it.

2025
02:04:35.40 --> 02:04:38.40
I'll get you like a new t-shirt or something. You wear that one.

2026
02:04:38.40 --> 02:04:40.40
No, this t-shirt's fine. Don't get me a new one.

2027
02:04:40.40 --> 02:04:42.40
This one works good.

2028
02:04:42.40 --> 02:04:47.40
So, yeah, that's, yeah, it seems like a good gift.

2029
02:04:47.40 --> 02:04:49.40
It's just going off on a tangent.

2030
02:04:49.40 --> 02:04:52.40
I feel like you went off on a tangent.

2031
02:04:52.40 --> 02:04:54.40
You know why? Because I was listening to the white stripes the other day.

2032
02:04:54.40 --> 02:04:57.40
I was thinking, I never give the white stripes the props that they deserve.

2033
02:04:57.40 --> 02:05:00.40
Yeah, I'm a jack white, the props that he deserves.

2034
02:05:00.40 --> 02:05:02.40
As a singer songwriter.

2035
02:05:02.40 --> 02:05:03.40
Aren't they brother and sister?

2036
02:05:03.40 --> 02:05:04.40
They're not.

2037
02:05:04.40 --> 02:05:05.40
They're not a big league.

2038
02:05:05.40 --> 02:05:06.40
Allegedly.

2039
02:05:06.40 --> 02:05:07.40
They were actually husband and wife.

2040
02:05:07.40 --> 02:05:09.40
They got divorced, but they always claimed to be brother's sister.

2041
02:05:09.40 --> 02:05:10.40
It's my little sister, Meg White.

2042
02:05:10.40 --> 02:05:11.40
More like.

2043
02:05:11.40 --> 02:05:12.40
Or this is my big sister.

2044
02:05:12.40 --> 02:05:13.40
That's right.

2045
02:05:13.40 --> 02:05:13.40
Yeah.

2046
02:05:13.40 --> 02:05:14.40
It's what he always said.

2047
02:05:14.40 --> 02:05:15.40
Thank you.

2048
02:05:15.40 --> 02:05:16.40
It's good, man.

2049
02:05:16.40 --> 02:05:17.40
Cool.

2050
02:05:17.40 --> 02:05:22.40
Well, the original point was these crazy savage type people.

2051
02:05:22.40 --> 02:05:26.40
Maybe normal people other than their crazy job.

2052
02:05:26.40 --> 02:05:27.40
Yeah.

2053
02:05:27.40 --> 02:05:29.40
And what's, and I'm, but I'm not saying so.

2054
02:05:29.40 --> 02:05:30.40
It's cool.

2055
02:05:30.40 --> 02:05:31.40
I'm not saying so.

2056
02:05:31.40 --> 02:05:34.40
And this is your, your, your accountable for your actions.

2057
02:05:34.40 --> 02:05:35.40
Yeah.

2058
02:05:35.40 --> 02:05:36.40
You're going to say, well, cool.

2059
02:05:36.40 --> 02:05:37.40
You are.

2060
02:05:37.40 --> 02:05:37.40
Yeah.

2061
02:05:37.40 --> 02:05:38.40
Yeah.

2062
02:05:38.40 --> 02:05:41.40
And that's something from any leadership position.

2063
02:05:41.40 --> 02:05:42.40
You need to be aware of.

2064
02:05:42.40 --> 02:05:45.40
And when I say new leadership position, I mean, you as a front line trooper.

2065
02:05:45.40 --> 02:05:48.40
Because if you as a front line trooper is getting told do something that you know as morally

2066
02:05:48.40 --> 02:05:50.40
ethically or legally wrong and you still do it.

2067
02:05:50.40 --> 02:05:53.40
It's on you sure you can point to finger and blame the higher ups and the higher

2068
02:05:53.40 --> 02:05:56.40
ups should be burned to if they told you do something that was wrong.

2069
02:05:56.40 --> 02:05:57.40
Yeah.

2070
02:05:57.40 --> 02:05:59.40
But you need to be accountable for what you did.

2071
02:05:59.40 --> 02:06:00.40
And that's all there is to it.

2072
02:06:00.40 --> 02:06:00.40
Yeah.

2073
02:06:00.40 --> 02:06:02.40
That's a rough tour.

2074
02:06:02.40 --> 02:06:04.40
No one wants to play that game.

2075
02:06:04.40 --> 02:06:06.40
The Nazis wanted to play that game.

2076
02:06:06.40 --> 02:06:07.40
Oh, it's not mine.

2077
02:06:07.40 --> 02:06:08.40
I was ordered to do this.

2078
02:06:08.40 --> 02:06:09.40
Can't do that.

2079
02:06:09.40 --> 02:06:10.40
Can't say that.

2080
02:06:10.40 --> 02:06:11.40
Don't get that excuse.

2081
02:06:11.40 --> 02:06:12.40
Yeah.

2082
02:06:12.40 --> 02:06:13.40
You don't get the, I was a good person.

2083
02:06:13.40 --> 02:06:14.40
And I took care of my kids.

2084
02:06:14.40 --> 02:06:17.40
Even though I was shoving people into into a gas chamber.

2085
02:06:17.40 --> 02:06:18.40
You don't get to play that game.

2086
02:06:18.40 --> 02:06:19.40
No.

2087
02:06:19.40 --> 02:06:20.40
Yeah, man.

2088
02:06:20.40 --> 02:06:21.40
Too much.

2089
02:06:21.40 --> 02:06:23.40
But there was a small little documentary on blind.

2090
02:06:23.40 --> 02:06:24.40
I don't know.

2091
02:06:24.40 --> 02:06:25.40
I don't watch the whole thing.

2092
02:06:25.40 --> 02:06:28.40
But it was about the executioner in the middle east somewhere, you know,

2093
02:06:28.40 --> 02:06:31.40
when these countries were, you know, he has his sword.

2094
02:06:31.40 --> 02:06:32.40
Yep.

2095
02:06:32.40 --> 02:06:35.40
And it's his job, you know, and he's just straight up executioner.

2096
02:06:35.40 --> 02:06:36.40
Yeah.

2097
02:06:36.40 --> 02:06:36.40
That's it.

2098
02:06:36.40 --> 02:06:37.40
That's just his job.

2099
02:06:37.40 --> 02:06:38.40
My dad's a job by the way.

2100
02:06:38.40 --> 02:06:39.40
And he's like, yeah.

2101
02:06:39.40 --> 02:06:40.40
It wasn't old school.

2102
02:06:40.40 --> 02:06:41.40
Oh, it's on YouTube.

2103
02:06:41.40 --> 02:06:42.40
Yeah.

2104
02:06:42.40 --> 02:06:43.40
Like last week.

2105
02:06:43.40 --> 02:06:44.40
Yeah.

2106
02:06:44.40 --> 02:06:44.40
And there.

2107
02:06:44.40 --> 02:06:47.40
But it's funny because the whole feel of the documentary was just real.

2108
02:06:47.40 --> 02:06:48.40
Like, oh, yeah.

2109
02:06:48.40 --> 02:06:49.40
This guy has a cool job.

2110
02:06:49.40 --> 02:06:52.40
And he's like slicing people's heads off with great precision.

2111
02:06:52.40 --> 02:06:54.40
And he's so good at his job.

2112
02:06:54.40 --> 02:06:56.40
You know, here's his family.

2113
02:06:56.40 --> 02:06:59.40
And they're loving, you know, and they're, you know, he's playing with his kids.

2114
02:06:59.40 --> 02:07:00.40
It's like all this stuff.

2115
02:07:00.40 --> 02:07:03.40
It's just weird, man.

2116
02:07:03.40 --> 02:07:04.40
Anyway.

2117
02:07:04.40 --> 02:07:04.40
Yeah.

2118
02:07:04.40 --> 02:07:06.40
There's, there's,

2119
02:07:06.40 --> 02:07:08.40
another culture.

2120
02:07:08.40 --> 02:07:09.40
Yeah.

2121
02:07:09.40 --> 02:07:10.40
It's weird.

2122
02:07:10.40 --> 02:07:12.40
A lot of gray areas in that one too.

2123
02:07:12.40 --> 02:07:13.40
But man.

2124
02:07:13.40 --> 02:07:14.40
Indeed.

2125
02:07:14.40 --> 02:07:15.40
Kind of.

2126
02:07:15.40 --> 02:07:16.40
Anyway.

2127
02:07:16.40 --> 02:07:17.40
Or not.

2128
02:07:17.40 --> 02:07:21.40
I feel like we should go into the support.

2129
02:07:21.40 --> 02:07:22.40
Yeah.

2130
02:07:22.40 --> 02:07:24.40
We should go into the support.

2131
02:07:24.40 --> 02:07:26.40
So support is one of those good things.

2132
02:07:26.40 --> 02:07:27.40
Very dynamic.

2133
02:07:27.40 --> 02:07:31.40
Supporting others supporting yourself.

2134
02:07:31.40 --> 02:07:35.40
Supporting others and yourself, which is a separate category of support.

2135
02:07:35.40 --> 02:07:36.40
My opinion.

2136
02:07:36.40 --> 02:07:38.40
So there's yourself, others, and yourself.

2137
02:07:38.40 --> 02:07:39.40
And others.

2138
02:07:39.40 --> 02:07:41.40
That's not the category.

2139
02:07:41.40 --> 02:07:44.40
When we talk about on it, we're talking about all three categories.

2140
02:07:44.40 --> 02:07:45.40
Support yourself.

2141
02:07:45.40 --> 02:07:47.40
By with supplementation.

2142
02:07:47.40 --> 02:07:49.40
And we talk about supplementation all the time.

2143
02:07:49.40 --> 02:07:50.40
But.

2144
02:07:50.40 --> 02:07:52.40
You know, you talk about supplementation.

2145
02:07:52.40 --> 02:07:55.40
Well, you're the one who turned it, turned me on to it.

2146
02:07:55.40 --> 02:07:58.40
So actually some of it.

2147
02:07:58.40 --> 02:08:02.40
I took Schumtech before you talk the before pre podcast.

2148
02:08:02.40 --> 02:08:03.40
Pre podcast.

2149
02:08:03.40 --> 02:08:05.40
I was on Schumtech.

2150
02:08:05.40 --> 02:08:06.40
I was on Alpha Brain.

2151
02:08:06.40 --> 02:08:09.40
Schumtech.

2152
02:08:09.40 --> 02:08:13.40
I got my shipment of Alpha Brain pills.

2153
02:08:13.40 --> 02:08:15.40
But back in, I had run out.

2154
02:08:15.40 --> 02:08:17.40
And I was only had the instant.

2155
02:08:17.40 --> 02:08:21.40
And so now like I said, what's nice about the pills is you got something.

2156
02:08:21.40 --> 02:08:23.40
You got something coming to come to do the podcast.

2157
02:08:23.40 --> 02:08:24.40
Guess what?

2158
02:08:24.40 --> 02:08:25.40
Alpha Brain pills.

2159
02:08:25.40 --> 02:08:29.40
And I might double up on the Alpha Brain if I think I got to really get my

2160
02:08:29.40 --> 02:08:30.40
Gary.

2161
02:08:30.40 --> 02:08:33.40
But it's good to have the the capsules.

2162
02:08:33.40 --> 02:08:34.40
Yeah.

2163
02:08:34.40 --> 02:08:35.40
As well.

2164
02:08:35.40 --> 02:08:36.40
I dig in.

2165
02:08:36.40 --> 02:08:38.40
But what's cool about the drink is it tastes good.

2166
02:08:38.40 --> 02:08:42.40
And I, if you get the sweet tooth itch going and you want something sweet.

2167
02:08:42.40 --> 02:08:43.40
And you get the peach.

2168
02:08:43.40 --> 02:08:44.40
Yeah.

2169
02:08:44.40 --> 02:08:46.40
The natural peach, not the spicy.

2170
02:08:46.40 --> 02:08:48.40
The spicy has a different situation going on.

2171
02:08:48.40 --> 02:08:50.40
The peach is just straight up like tasty.

2172
02:08:50.40 --> 02:08:51.40
Like peach.

2173
02:08:51.40 --> 02:08:52.40
Yeah.

2174
02:08:52.40 --> 02:08:53.40
Peach.

2175
02:08:53.40 --> 02:08:54.40
Peach.

2176
02:08:54.40 --> 02:08:55.40
Yeah.

2177
02:08:55.40 --> 02:08:56.40
Kind of like that.

2178
02:08:56.40 --> 02:08:58.40
I dig it the pills.

2179
02:08:58.40 --> 02:08:59.40
I dig it.

2180
02:08:59.40 --> 02:09:01.40
And that's actually what we had.

2181
02:09:01.40 --> 02:09:02.40
Was the pills.

2182
02:09:02.40 --> 02:09:05.40
I said, we, because me and my brother were.

2183
02:09:05.40 --> 02:09:06.40
Alpha Brain.

2184
02:09:06.40 --> 02:09:08.40
But when they came out with the instant that was better.

2185
02:09:08.40 --> 02:09:10.40
And it starts to become like this little kind of ritual.

2186
02:09:10.40 --> 02:09:12.40
You know, you mix up your Alpha Brain.

2187
02:09:12.40 --> 02:09:13.40
You know, kind of thing.

2188
02:09:13.40 --> 02:09:14.40
And it's instant.

2189
02:09:14.40 --> 02:09:15.40
I don't know.

2190
02:09:15.40 --> 02:09:17.40
Just seems like either way it doesn't matter.

2191
02:09:17.40 --> 02:09:19.40
If I haven't mentioned it already, I think I did.

2192
02:09:19.40 --> 02:09:22.40
These are supplements from on it on it.

2193
02:09:22.40 --> 02:09:23.40
On it.com.

2194
02:09:23.40 --> 02:09:25.40
We talked about the supplements.

2195
02:09:25.40 --> 02:09:27.40
But there's like workout side.

2196
02:09:27.40 --> 02:09:28.40
I just bought a jump rope.

2197
02:09:28.40 --> 02:09:29.40
Did you?

2198
02:09:29.40 --> 02:09:30.40
Yeah.

2199
02:09:30.40 --> 02:09:31.40
See.

2200
02:09:31.40 --> 02:09:34.40
So when I was young, I was good at jumping rope too.

2201
02:09:34.40 --> 02:09:35.40
Yeah.

2202
02:09:35.40 --> 02:09:40.40
And then as I, you know, as I think kind of when, when, I don't

2203
02:09:40.40 --> 02:09:42.40
maybe early 20s kind of stopped.

2204
02:09:42.40 --> 02:09:43.40
So that's long time ago.

2205
02:09:43.40 --> 02:09:45.40
Jump rope is awesome.

2206
02:09:45.40 --> 02:09:46.40
Yeah.

2207
02:09:46.40 --> 02:09:48.40
So as in, you know, you know, how like writing a bike.

2208
02:09:48.40 --> 02:09:50.40
You can stay good at something a little bit.

2209
02:09:50.40 --> 02:09:51.40
You're rusty.

2210
02:09:51.40 --> 02:09:52.40
You're rusty.

2211
02:09:52.40 --> 02:09:52.40
Yeah.

2212
02:09:52.40 --> 02:09:53.40
Definitely give me rusty.

2213
02:09:53.40 --> 02:09:54.40
You can't shred.

2214
02:09:54.40 --> 02:09:55.40
And can't go as long.

2215
02:09:55.40 --> 02:09:56.40
You know, like that could stuff.

2216
02:09:56.40 --> 02:09:58.40
It's weird because it, you know how jump rope is.

2217
02:09:58.40 --> 02:10:00.40
You know what's your weirdest back in the day of boxing?

2218
02:10:00.40 --> 02:10:01.40
And no.

2219
02:10:01.40 --> 02:10:02.40
Yeah.

2220
02:10:02.40 --> 02:10:04.40
Boxing jumping rope for three minutes was like no factor.

2221
02:10:04.40 --> 02:10:05.40
Yeah.

2222
02:10:05.40 --> 02:10:06.40
Go jump.

2223
02:10:06.40 --> 02:10:07.40
Yeah.

2224
02:10:07.40 --> 02:10:08.40
Go get your jump rope right out.

2225
02:10:08.40 --> 02:10:09.40
Get out.

2226
02:10:09.40 --> 02:10:10.40
Get out.

2227
02:10:10.40 --> 02:10:11.40
Three minutes on the ground.

2228
02:10:11.40 --> 02:10:12.40
You feel it.

2229
02:10:12.40 --> 02:10:13.40
Yeah.

2230
02:10:13.40 --> 02:10:14.40
So yeah.

2231
02:10:14.40 --> 02:10:15.40
About one of those.

2232
02:10:15.40 --> 02:10:17.40
And it's so the interesting thing about that is.

2233
02:10:17.40 --> 02:10:20.40
Jump rope technology has changed a little bit.

2234
02:10:20.40 --> 02:10:21.40
So what does it made of steel?

2235
02:10:21.40 --> 02:10:22.40
No.

2236
02:10:22.40 --> 02:10:24.40
Well, there's, I'm sure there's steel in there.

2237
02:10:24.40 --> 02:10:26.40
So but it's like each handle has a swivel.

2238
02:10:26.40 --> 02:10:27.40
The little, I mean it's simple.

2239
02:10:27.40 --> 02:10:30.40
But there's like way more to it than before last time.

2240
02:10:30.40 --> 02:10:32.40
It was like two wooden handles and a rope.

2241
02:10:32.40 --> 02:10:33.40
Yeah.

2242
02:10:33.40 --> 02:10:34.40
Yeah.

2243
02:10:34.40 --> 02:10:34.40
For sure.

2244
02:10:34.40 --> 02:10:35.40
Actual rope.

2245
02:10:35.40 --> 02:10:37.40
This one is like a cord that survives all this stuff.

2246
02:10:37.40 --> 02:10:38.40
I don't know.

2247
02:10:38.40 --> 02:10:39.40
Anyway, got a jump rope.

2248
02:10:39.40 --> 02:10:41.40
The jump rope is on there if you want.

2249
02:10:41.40 --> 02:10:43.40
Well, we'll have a jump off.

2250
02:10:43.40 --> 02:10:44.40
Yeah.

2251
02:10:44.40 --> 02:10:45.40
I was pretty good too.

2252
02:10:45.40 --> 02:10:47.40
You had to put your nerve through.

2253
02:10:47.40 --> 02:10:53.40
You remember when you jump rope and then when the, you know how like, and this was like elementary school.

2254
02:10:53.40 --> 02:10:59.40
And if you get tired or you couldn't keep a rhythm, they'd say, hey, just just wave it from the front.

2255
02:10:59.40 --> 02:11:01.40
You know, that's an angel move.

2256
02:11:01.40 --> 02:11:02.40
Yeah.

2257
02:11:02.40 --> 02:11:06.40
What's it called when you to turn to taro, to taro when you boom.

2258
02:11:06.40 --> 02:11:07.40
Like I like,

2259
02:11:09.40 --> 02:11:10.40
Matador.

2260
02:11:10.40 --> 02:11:13.40
Is it called Matador when you just go side to side?

2261
02:11:13.40 --> 02:11:16.40
Yeah.

2262
02:11:16.40 --> 02:11:18.40
You can't get it or whatever.

2263
02:11:18.40 --> 02:11:19.40
Yeah.

2264
02:11:19.40 --> 02:11:20.40
I just get that rhythm going.

2265
02:11:20.40 --> 02:11:21.40
Oh, yeah.

2266
02:11:21.40 --> 02:11:22.40
I don't know the name.

2267
02:11:22.40 --> 02:11:23.40
I never had to do that because I was expert level.

2268
02:11:23.40 --> 02:11:28.40
Even in elementary school, but that's going to be you if, in fact, you want to step up.

2269
02:11:28.40 --> 02:11:30.40
So you can get that on on it, not just.

2270
02:11:30.40 --> 02:11:33.40
If you want, if you want, kettle bells on there too.

2271
02:11:33.40 --> 02:11:34.40
The good kind.

2272
02:11:34.40 --> 02:11:36.40
Well, kettle bells are good straight out.

2273
02:11:36.40 --> 02:11:37.40
They're all good.

2274
02:11:37.40 --> 02:11:40.40
And, but it has those artistic ones.

2275
02:11:40.40 --> 02:11:41.40
Yeah.

2276
02:11:41.40 --> 02:11:43.40
The competition ones are very cool hands.

2277
02:11:43.40 --> 02:11:44.40
Yeah.

2278
02:11:44.40 --> 02:11:45.40
Oh, yeah.

2279
02:11:45.40 --> 02:11:48.40
So yeah, you get the legend bells, which is like what?

2280
02:11:48.40 --> 02:11:49.40
Cyclops.

2281
02:11:49.40 --> 02:11:50.40
The wear wolf.

2282
02:11:50.40 --> 02:11:51.40
Better look at them there.

2283
02:11:51.40 --> 02:11:52.40
There dope.

2284
02:11:52.40 --> 02:11:56.40
You know, primal bells, which is like all that, you know, primates and stuff.

2285
02:11:56.40 --> 02:11:57.40
Yeah.

2286
02:11:57.40 --> 02:11:59.40
I think I got the,

2287
02:11:59.40 --> 02:12:02.40
Chimp two chimps and two wear wolves.

2288
02:12:02.40 --> 02:12:03.40
Yes.

2289
02:12:03.40 --> 02:12:03.40
Yeah.

2290
02:12:03.40 --> 02:12:05.40
I have zombie bells.

2291
02:12:05.40 --> 02:12:06.40
Mine are just eagles on base.

2292
02:12:06.40 --> 02:12:07.40
How big is this on?

2293
02:12:07.40 --> 02:12:08.40
Don't want you out.

2294
02:12:08.40 --> 02:12:09.40
I forgot I got a lock.

2295
02:12:09.40 --> 02:12:10.40
Yeah.

2296
02:12:10.40 --> 02:12:11.40
So it's like designer.

2297
02:12:11.40 --> 02:12:13.40
You can you probably keep it inside too.

2298
02:12:13.40 --> 02:12:14.40
Yeah.

2299
02:12:14.40 --> 02:12:15.40
No, that's that's it.

2300
02:12:15.40 --> 02:12:16.40
You really do.

2301
02:12:16.40 --> 02:12:21.40
No, the one that I keep inside is not the ones in my garage are for the long heavy work.

2302
02:12:21.40 --> 02:12:24.40
This one is for, oh, I'm tired of writing right now.

2303
02:12:24.40 --> 02:12:26.40
I'm going to bang out some snatches.

2304
02:12:26.40 --> 02:12:27.40
Right.

2305
02:12:27.40 --> 02:12:28.40
Boom.

2306
02:12:28.40 --> 02:12:29.40
Boom.

2307
02:12:29.40 --> 02:12:30.40
God.

2308
02:12:30.40 --> 02:12:31.40
Feel a lot better now.

2309
02:12:31.40 --> 02:12:32.40
Yeah.

2310
02:12:32.40 --> 02:12:33.40
Right.

2311
02:12:33.40 --> 02:12:34.40
Yeah.

2312
02:12:34.40 --> 02:12:34.40
There you go.

2313
02:12:34.40 --> 02:12:35.40
But yeah, this is anyway.

2314
02:12:35.40 --> 02:12:39.40
The point there is there's very cool things on the website on it.com.

2315
02:12:39.40 --> 02:12:42.40
And the supplements, it's not to mention this.

2316
02:12:42.40 --> 02:12:47.40
The fact is the supplements are straight up the best ones straight up.

2317
02:12:47.40 --> 02:12:50.40
Because from the beginning and how is this?

2318
02:12:50.40 --> 02:12:54.40
And I don't know if we already mentioned this, but I hear it all.

2319
02:12:54.40 --> 02:12:55.40
I do.

2320
02:12:55.40 --> 02:12:55.40
I don't know if we already mentioned this, but I hear it all.

2321
02:12:55.40 --> 02:12:56.40
I do.

2322
02:12:56.40 --> 02:12:58.40
I don't know if we already mentioned this, but I hear it all.

2323
02:12:58.40 --> 02:12:59.40
I do.

2324
02:12:59.40 --> 02:13:02.40
I listen to Joel Rogan all the time and he says these things.

2325
02:13:02.40 --> 02:13:04.40
And I believe him.

2326
02:13:04.40 --> 02:13:06.40
If you get like, I don't know.

2327
02:13:06.40 --> 02:13:07.40
Shroom tech.

2328
02:13:07.40 --> 02:13:08.40
Yeah.

2329
02:13:08.40 --> 02:13:09.40
I don't even feel it.

2330
02:13:09.40 --> 02:13:10.40
I got tapped out.

2331
02:13:10.40 --> 02:13:12.40
So, you know, I expect more out of Shroom tech.

2332
02:13:12.40 --> 02:13:14.40
I expect this to make me tap out everybody.

2333
02:13:14.40 --> 02:13:15.40
I don't like it.

2334
02:13:15.40 --> 02:13:16.40
Send it back.

2335
02:13:16.40 --> 02:13:18.40
No, you don't even send it back.

2336
02:13:18.40 --> 02:13:19.40
You send them an email.

2337
02:13:19.40 --> 02:13:20.40
Saying hey, I don't like this.

2338
02:13:20.40 --> 02:13:21.40
I'll just send you money back.

2339
02:13:21.40 --> 02:13:22.40
You don't have to send it back.

2340
02:13:22.40 --> 02:13:24.40
That's pretty awesome then.

2341
02:13:24.40 --> 02:13:25.40
Yep.

2342
02:13:25.40 --> 02:13:28.40
But don't be trying to be like, you're going to give me my money back.

2343
02:13:28.40 --> 02:13:31.40
And the next month after you're done with it, order some more.

2344
02:13:31.40 --> 02:13:32.40
And then do it again.

2345
02:13:32.40 --> 02:13:33.40
Don't do it again.

2346
02:13:33.40 --> 02:13:34.40
Yeah.

2347
02:13:34.40 --> 02:13:36.40
You're going to get ostracized nonetheless.

2348
02:13:36.40 --> 02:13:37.40
Crill oil.

2349
02:13:37.40 --> 02:13:39.40
That's the one you don't want to not have crill oil.

2350
02:13:39.40 --> 02:13:44.40
Even if you're like a young guy in my opinion, which I should always been on crill oil.

2351
02:13:44.40 --> 02:13:45.40
Yeah.

2352
02:13:45.40 --> 02:13:49.40
And if you're not on crill oil, I think you are like a step behind joint wise.

2353
02:13:49.40 --> 02:13:52.40
Which puts you behind a lot of different ways.

2354
02:13:52.40 --> 02:13:53.40
A lot of different ways.

2355
02:13:53.40 --> 02:13:54.40
Yeah, you didn't work and out as hard.

2356
02:13:54.40 --> 02:13:56.40
And I was working on this hard.

2357
02:13:56.40 --> 02:13:59.40
A struggling through various activities in everyday life.

2358
02:13:59.40 --> 02:14:02.40
I told this story whatever, but I do it all the time.

2359
02:14:02.40 --> 02:14:05.40
You know, when you fill up water in the big five gallon jugs.

2360
02:14:05.40 --> 02:14:08.40
And you know, and Brad, do that at night when it's kind of cold.

2361
02:14:08.40 --> 02:14:11.40
It's like, break your carry those things from the thing to your car.

2362
02:14:11.40 --> 02:14:15.40
You don't want to be worried about my knees or whatever.

2363
02:14:15.40 --> 02:14:16.40
You're back.

2364
02:14:16.40 --> 02:14:17.40
The trials.

2365
02:14:17.40 --> 02:14:18.40
You shouldn't be like that.

2366
02:14:18.40 --> 02:14:19.40
And you've got to put it in there.

2367
02:14:19.40 --> 02:14:22.40
You think I should write your own book, dude?

2368
02:14:22.40 --> 02:14:26.40
What about like the kind of crazy trials you've been through, carrying water?

2369
02:14:26.40 --> 02:14:29.40
I'll look cool night in Southern California.

2370
02:14:29.40 --> 02:14:30.40
I know.

2371
02:14:30.40 --> 02:14:35.40
You know, very fresh and pure water, by the way.

2372
02:14:35.40 --> 02:14:36.40
Doesn't make it lighter though.

2373
02:14:36.40 --> 02:14:37.40
You still have to struggle.

2374
02:14:37.40 --> 02:14:39.40
But here's the thing, though.

2375
02:14:39.40 --> 02:14:42.40
There are micro, they're called micro struggles.

2376
02:14:42.40 --> 02:14:43.40
It's really what they are.

2377
02:14:43.40 --> 02:14:45.40
You know, standing in line.

2378
02:14:45.40 --> 02:14:47.40
Actually, in the same kind of thing, that's not a struggle.

2379
02:14:47.40 --> 02:14:48.40
That's manufactured struggle.

2380
02:14:48.40 --> 02:14:52.40
So it's like an exercise in discipline and embracing struggle.

2381
02:14:52.40 --> 02:14:53.40
That's what it is.

2382
02:14:53.40 --> 02:14:57.40
It's not an actual struggle bestowed upon your heap on your shoulders.

2383
02:14:57.40 --> 02:14:59.40
You know, they have to bear in everyday life.

2384
02:14:59.40 --> 02:15:01.40
That's not what's the standing in line.

2385
02:15:01.40 --> 02:15:04.40
That's why if you need your book about echoes struggles.

2386
02:15:04.40 --> 02:15:07.40
You can document these various.

2387
02:15:07.40 --> 02:15:10.40
Me looking for a specific wine.

2388
02:15:10.40 --> 02:15:11.40
That's why.

2389
02:15:11.40 --> 02:15:12.40
Was there a tomato one?

2390
02:15:12.40 --> 02:15:13.40
Two likes.

2391
02:15:13.40 --> 02:15:14.40
We're going to tomato sauce.

2392
02:15:14.40 --> 02:15:15.40
I went.

2393
02:15:15.40 --> 02:15:16.40
Yes.

2394
02:15:16.40 --> 02:15:18.40
Yeah, it's a tomato struggle.

2395
02:15:18.40 --> 02:15:19.40
The wine struggle.

2396
02:15:19.40 --> 02:15:20.40
The groceries now.

2397
02:15:20.40 --> 02:15:21.40
We got the fill in the water bottles.

2398
02:15:21.40 --> 02:15:22.40
There's four chapters.

2399
02:15:22.40 --> 02:15:23.40
My micro struggles.

2400
02:15:23.40 --> 02:15:23.40
Yeah.

2401
02:15:23.40 --> 02:15:26.40
And filling up the water is not a struggle because I'm on the

2402
02:15:26.40 --> 02:15:29.40
real oil. Oh, Omega 3 is fighting to my joint.

2403
02:15:29.40 --> 02:15:30.40
Straight into my joints.

2404
02:15:30.40 --> 02:15:31.40
Uptake.

2405
02:15:31.40 --> 02:15:33.40
High percentage uptake.

2406
02:15:33.40 --> 02:15:36.40
Anyway, get on the cruel oil.

2407
02:15:36.40 --> 02:15:37.40
I'm on the strong bone now, too.

2408
02:15:37.40 --> 02:15:41.40
By the way, for that's for tendons.

2409
02:15:41.40 --> 02:15:44.40
The tendon attaching to the bone.

2410
02:15:44.40 --> 02:15:46.40
Strong TM does it.

2411
02:15:46.40 --> 02:15:47.40
It does it about it.

2412
02:15:47.40 --> 02:15:49.40
I feel really good about it actually.

2413
02:15:49.40 --> 02:15:52.40
More preventative because I lift.

2414
02:15:52.40 --> 02:15:53.40
Yeah.

2415
02:15:53.40 --> 02:15:54.40
Nonetheless,

2416
02:15:54.40 --> 02:15:56.40
Strong TM that's in strong bone.

2417
02:15:56.40 --> 02:15:57.40
That get doesn't.

2418
02:15:57.40 --> 02:16:00.40
That doesn't hit the like the limelight isn't on that all the time.

2419
02:16:00.40 --> 02:16:01.40
It's all on calcium most of the time.

2420
02:16:01.40 --> 02:16:02.40
I'm like calcium.

2421
02:16:02.40 --> 02:16:03.40
It makes your bone strong.

2422
02:16:03.40 --> 02:16:05.40
Strong TM just as much.

2423
02:16:05.40 --> 02:16:08.40
So get on the strong bone.

2424
02:16:08.40 --> 02:16:10.40
A bone strength.

2425
02:16:10.40 --> 02:16:12.40
Also.

2426
02:16:12.40 --> 02:16:13.40
Offer brain.

2427
02:16:13.40 --> 02:16:15.40
Obviously, shrimp tech for high performance.

2428
02:16:15.40 --> 02:16:16.40
Go on the website.

2429
02:16:16.40 --> 02:16:17.40
Whatever you need, they got it.

2430
02:16:17.40 --> 02:16:21.40
They even got like a try bland peanut butter.

2431
02:16:21.40 --> 02:16:22.40
Not butter.

2432
02:16:22.40 --> 02:16:23.40
It's not peanut butter.

2433
02:16:23.40 --> 02:16:26.40
It's like almond cashew and walnut.

2434
02:16:26.40 --> 02:16:27.40
Don't know.

2435
02:16:27.40 --> 02:16:28.40
Anyway, still dish.

2436
02:16:28.40 --> 02:16:29.40
Get on the own.

2437
02:16:29.40 --> 02:16:30.40
Anyway, on it.

2438
02:16:30.40 --> 02:16:31.40
Dock-off.

2439
02:16:31.40 --> 02:16:32.40
Slash-Jockel.

2440
02:16:32.40 --> 02:16:34.40
If you want 10% off.

2441
02:16:34.40 --> 02:16:36.40
Pay full price.

2442
02:16:36.40 --> 02:16:37.40
That's up to you.

2443
02:16:37.40 --> 02:16:38.40
Really?

2444
02:16:38.40 --> 02:16:40.40
You haven't seen?

2445
02:16:40.40 --> 02:16:41.40
I wouldn't recommend it.

2446
02:16:41.40 --> 02:16:45.40
I don't even know if anyone would recommend that.

2447
02:16:45.40 --> 02:16:48.40
Also, good way to support.

2448
02:16:48.40 --> 02:16:52.40
If you're interested in the book.

2449
02:16:52.40 --> 02:17:00.40
Man search for meaning, Victor Franco.

2450
02:17:00.40 --> 02:17:07.40
What I have done is I put on the website a page with all of the books.

2451
02:17:07.40 --> 02:17:08.40
All of them.

2452
02:17:08.40 --> 02:17:11.40
That Jocqu's covered.

2453
02:17:11.40 --> 02:17:13.40
Everyone's a well-jocqua-covered article.

2454
02:17:13.40 --> 02:17:15.40
The links may be all do that.

2455
02:17:15.40 --> 02:17:17.40
But nonetheless, the books are all on there.

2456
02:17:17.40 --> 02:17:18.40
All in order, too, by the way.

2457
02:17:18.40 --> 02:17:20.40
So the most recent is going to be at the top.

2458
02:17:20.40 --> 02:17:22.40
This one will be on there. It is on there.

2459
02:17:22.40 --> 02:17:25.40
If you want to support, click on there.

2460
02:17:25.40 --> 02:17:28.40
If you're going to get the book, click through there.

2461
02:17:28.40 --> 02:17:30.40
Directs you straight to Amazon.

2462
02:17:30.40 --> 02:17:32.40
What if you're doing other shopping?

2463
02:17:32.40 --> 02:17:34.40
Hey, man. Go ahead. Do the same thing.

2464
02:17:34.40 --> 02:17:36.40
Click on it. We have a banner on the front page, too.

2465
02:17:36.40 --> 02:17:38.40
And then you can click on there.

2466
02:17:38.40 --> 02:17:39.40
Yeah? And then you can do shopping.

2467
02:17:39.40 --> 02:17:40.40
Yeah, if you want.

2468
02:17:40.40 --> 02:17:41.40
That sounds like a good plan.

2469
02:17:41.40 --> 02:17:44.40
Even if you buy and don't take.

2470
02:17:44.40 --> 02:17:48.40
Also, do you have a link to your favorite duct tape on there?

2471
02:17:48.40 --> 02:17:49.40
No.

2472
02:17:49.40 --> 02:17:53.40
Sometimes I say things that are just so inherently brilliant.

2473
02:17:53.40 --> 02:17:54.40
And that's what we wonder.

2474
02:17:54.40 --> 02:17:58.40
So we will have a duct tape link.

2475
02:17:58.40 --> 02:17:59.40
Link for sure.

2476
02:17:59.40 --> 02:18:02.40
Yeah, just in case everyone needs duct tape.

2477
02:18:02.40 --> 02:18:05.40
And they especially need it when they get the most of the podcasts

2478
02:18:05.40 --> 02:18:08.40
or they're thinking about the things that they're going to be duct-caping together.

2479
02:18:08.40 --> 02:18:09.40
Yeah.

2480
02:18:09.40 --> 02:18:10.40
Yeah, that's true.

2481
02:18:10.40 --> 02:18:12.40
You know why I mentioned duct tape in the beginning?

2482
02:18:12.40 --> 02:18:15.40
And I didn't really realize this because I didn't think about it

2483
02:18:15.40 --> 02:18:18.40
until the handful of people asked me.

2484
02:18:18.40 --> 02:18:19.40
You know why?

2485
02:18:19.40 --> 02:18:21.40
Because he's watching the guy relevant time.

2486
02:18:21.40 --> 02:18:22.40
Actually, I still watch my guy right now.

2487
02:18:22.40 --> 02:18:24.40
That's a strange thing.

2488
02:18:24.40 --> 02:18:25.40
No, no, no.

2489
02:18:25.40 --> 02:18:27.40
It's on the channel called Clue.

2490
02:18:27.40 --> 02:18:30.40
CLO, oh, random channel.

2491
02:18:30.40 --> 02:18:31.40
Yeah.

2492
02:18:31.40 --> 02:18:33.40
It's like a retro channel kind of.

2493
02:18:33.40 --> 02:18:34.40
Okay.

2494
02:18:34.40 --> 02:18:35.40
Okay, for a man.

2495
02:18:35.40 --> 02:18:36.40
No, it says that.

2496
02:18:36.40 --> 02:18:38.40
Well, there's a new guy right by the way.

2497
02:18:38.40 --> 02:18:39.40
A new one.

2498
02:18:39.40 --> 02:18:39.40
Which lame?

2499
02:18:39.40 --> 02:18:41.40
I don't think it says good as a old one, but it could be just my,

2500
02:18:41.40 --> 02:18:44.40
you know how you get attached to your old shows.

2501
02:18:44.40 --> 02:18:45.40
It could be that.

2502
02:18:45.40 --> 02:18:47.40
But my guy, we was dope back in the day.

2503
02:18:47.40 --> 02:18:48.40
So, you know, whichever.

2504
02:18:48.40 --> 02:18:49.40
And that was this thing.

2505
02:18:49.40 --> 02:18:50.40
Duck tape.

2506
02:18:50.40 --> 02:18:52.40
People like to say, well, paper clip, right?

2507
02:18:52.40 --> 02:18:55.40
My guy over with the paper, he, I never really had a paper clip.

2508
02:18:55.40 --> 02:18:56.40
Really?

2509
02:18:56.40 --> 02:18:57.40
He had duct tape.

2510
02:18:57.40 --> 02:18:58.40
That was his thing.

2511
02:18:58.40 --> 02:18:59.40
I know, sorry.

2512
02:18:59.40 --> 02:19:00.40
I watched TV.

2513
02:19:00.40 --> 02:19:01.40
All right, way.

2514
02:19:01.40 --> 02:19:02.40
That's on you.

2515
02:19:02.40 --> 02:19:03.40
And I dig it.

2516
02:19:03.40 --> 02:19:04.40
But I was busy getting back after.

2517
02:19:04.40 --> 02:19:05.40
He had the switch.

2518
02:19:05.40 --> 02:19:06.40
Sorry, man.

2519
02:19:06.40 --> 02:19:07.40
And the duct tape.

2520
02:19:07.40 --> 02:19:08.40
That was his thing.

2521
02:19:08.40 --> 02:19:10.40
Everything else he just found in his environment is environment, which

2522
02:19:10.40 --> 02:19:12.40
changed from episode to episode.

2523
02:19:12.40 --> 02:19:13.40
On the last.

2524
02:19:13.40 --> 02:19:16.40
Subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play.

2525
02:19:16.40 --> 02:19:19.40
All these platforms that provide podcasts.

2526
02:19:19.40 --> 02:19:20.40
We're on all of them.

2527
02:19:20.40 --> 02:19:23.40
Boom, subscribe, which everyone you use.

2528
02:19:23.40 --> 02:19:25.40
I mean, if he's two, I guess, right?

2529
02:19:25.40 --> 02:19:27.40
And then, do people use two platforms?

2530
02:19:27.40 --> 02:19:29.40
Why did I do that today?

2531
02:19:29.40 --> 02:19:33.40
There's some reason I had to go to a different platform.

2532
02:19:33.40 --> 02:19:36.40
So, I have a backup platform.

2533
02:19:36.40 --> 02:19:37.40
Boom, subscribe to both.

2534
02:19:37.40 --> 02:19:38.40
Yeah.

2535
02:19:38.40 --> 02:19:39.40
Right.

2536
02:19:39.40 --> 02:19:41.40
Is that kind of like YouTube and Vimeo?

2537
02:19:41.40 --> 02:19:43.40
You know, some guys who have a Vimeo account as well.

2538
02:19:43.40 --> 02:19:45.40
I don't know why that got escalated.

2539
02:19:45.40 --> 02:19:46.40
It's good.

2540
02:19:46.40 --> 02:19:47.40
YouTube.

2541
02:19:47.40 --> 02:19:48.40
Bad video.

2542
02:19:48.40 --> 02:19:49.40
I'll tell you what.

2543
02:19:49.40 --> 02:19:52.40
I don't know why, but this could be the reason why because YouTube.

2544
02:19:52.40 --> 02:19:53.40
Okay.

2545
02:19:53.40 --> 02:19:58.40
Vimeo is kind of for like professional people who fancy themselves as like film makers.

2546
02:19:58.40 --> 02:19:59.40
Right.

2547
02:19:59.40 --> 02:20:01.40
This is my piece that I've made in artists.

2548
02:20:01.40 --> 02:20:02.40
It tends to be that.

2549
02:20:02.40 --> 02:20:03.40
Right.

2550
02:20:03.40 --> 02:20:06.40
YouTube is just like, guys, you just kind of have to.

2551
02:20:06.40 --> 02:20:07.40
But overall, yeah, exactly right.

2552
02:20:07.40 --> 02:20:08.40
Just throw my video.

2553
02:20:08.40 --> 02:20:11.40
YouTube, like, you know, the tube, TV, to you.

2554
02:20:11.40 --> 02:20:13.40
Whatever you are.

2555
02:20:13.40 --> 02:20:14.40
Vimeo is, I don't know, the name.

2556
02:20:14.40 --> 02:20:15.40
I guess I can think about it.

2557
02:20:15.40 --> 02:20:19.40
But nonetheless, that's what it shook itself out to beat.

2558
02:20:19.40 --> 02:20:22.40
You know, so it's funny when people are like, I'm not on YouTube.

2559
02:20:22.40 --> 02:20:23.40
I'm on Vimeo.

2560
02:20:23.40 --> 02:20:24.40
I'm on my wrist.

2561
02:20:24.40 --> 02:20:25.40
Yeah.

2562
02:20:25.40 --> 02:20:29.40
Do you have to do anything to be on Vimeo or you're just still something to do?

2563
02:20:29.40 --> 02:20:30.40
No.

2564
02:20:30.40 --> 02:20:31.40
Same exact thing.

2565
02:20:31.40 --> 02:20:35.40
It's exactly like YouTube except for the fact, which now that I'm thinking about it makes sense,

2566
02:20:35.40 --> 02:20:40.40
where if you upload a video and you're like, oh man, in one of these titles midway through the video,

2567
02:20:40.40 --> 02:20:41.40
I spelt it wrong.

2568
02:20:41.40 --> 02:20:43.40
Which happens to me sometimes.

2569
02:20:43.40 --> 02:20:48.40
You can go back into your account and replace the video, even if it's been up for a week.

2570
02:20:48.40 --> 02:20:49.40
You can just replace or you too.

2571
02:20:49.40 --> 02:20:51.40
Vimeo, YouTube, you cannot.

2572
02:20:51.40 --> 02:20:52.40
Yes, a new video.

2573
02:20:52.40 --> 02:20:53.40
Yeah.

2574
02:20:53.40 --> 02:20:54.40
So you got to upload again.

2575
02:20:54.40 --> 02:20:55.40
And here's the thing.

2576
02:20:55.40 --> 02:20:57.40
You can't upload the same file.

2577
02:20:57.40 --> 02:20:58.40
Got to rename it.

2578
02:20:58.40 --> 02:21:00.40
Because YouTube, no, you got to re-eat it.

2579
02:21:00.40 --> 02:21:02.40
It has all these little information in the file.

2580
02:21:02.40 --> 02:21:04.40
They'll be like, hey, that's a duplicate file.

2581
02:21:04.40 --> 02:21:05.40
You can't do that.

2582
02:21:05.40 --> 02:21:08.40
You know, probably had something to do with advertising.

2583
02:21:08.40 --> 02:21:09.40
I don't know.

2584
02:21:09.40 --> 02:21:12.40
Nonetheless, subscribe to Jockel Podcast on YouTube.

2585
02:21:12.40 --> 02:21:17.40
If you like that channel, we're trying to provide what you call providing value.

2586
02:21:17.40 --> 02:21:19.40
You know, that's, don't say that.

2587
02:21:19.40 --> 02:21:23.40
But that's another, it sounded cool when I first heard it.

2588
02:21:23.40 --> 02:21:28.40
But it's another, that's another, it's a new, like,

2589
02:21:28.40 --> 02:21:31.40
that's another one of those things where it sounded cool.

2590
02:21:31.40 --> 02:21:35.40
And then everyone thought like me or I think like everyone else, whatever.

2591
02:21:35.40 --> 02:21:37.40
And so everyone started using it now.

2592
02:21:37.40 --> 02:21:38.40
It's like people are abusing it.

2593
02:21:38.40 --> 02:21:40.40
And maybe here, just trying to provide value.

2594
02:21:40.40 --> 02:21:43.40
It just starts to sound like that.

2595
02:21:43.40 --> 02:21:45.40
You know, good voice, you just have to think, you know, we don't do voices.

2596
02:21:45.40 --> 02:21:48.40
Other than exclamation.

2597
02:21:48.40 --> 02:21:50.40
Thanks, Jockel.

2598
02:21:50.40 --> 02:21:52.40
Anyway, subscribe to YouTube.

2599
02:21:52.40 --> 02:21:58.40
We're trying to provide some value there with the excerpts and various other clips.

2600
02:21:58.40 --> 02:22:03.40
Aside from the video version of this podcast, you're Memorial Day 1.

2601
02:22:03.40 --> 02:22:04.40
It was really good.

2602
02:22:04.40 --> 02:22:05.40
I liked it.

2603
02:22:05.40 --> 02:22:07.40
It was a powerful, powerful letter.

2604
02:22:07.40 --> 02:22:12.40
Yeah.

2605
02:22:12.40 --> 02:22:13.40
Bunch of other stuff.

2606
02:22:13.40 --> 02:22:17.40
Um, like.

2607
02:22:17.40 --> 02:22:19.40
Jockel has a store.

2608
02:22:19.40 --> 02:22:21.40
It's called Jockel Store.

2609
02:22:21.40 --> 02:22:22.40
If you didn't know already, no.

2610
02:22:22.40 --> 02:22:23.40
Jockelstore.com.

2611
02:22:23.40 --> 02:22:24.40
What do we have in Jockel Store?

2612
02:22:24.40 --> 02:22:26.40
We have T-shirts.

2613
02:22:26.40 --> 02:22:28.40
If you were to show it to Jockel, also as a podcast.

2614
02:22:28.40 --> 02:22:29.40
Sure.

2615
02:22:29.40 --> 02:22:30.40
Jockel.

2616
02:22:30.40 --> 02:22:31.40
Jockel has white tea.

2617
02:22:31.40 --> 02:22:32.40
It's called Jockel White Tea.

2618
02:22:32.40 --> 02:22:34.40
Yeah, I think I see a trend here.

2619
02:22:34.40 --> 02:22:35.40
Yeah.

2620
02:22:35.40 --> 02:22:36.40
Yeah, the trend is real.

2621
02:22:36.40 --> 02:22:37.40
Yeah, sure.

2622
02:22:37.40 --> 02:22:39.40
Um, nonetheless, the shit.

2623
02:22:39.40 --> 02:22:40.40
A virginality and name.

2624
02:22:40.40 --> 02:22:42.40
Well, no.

2625
02:22:42.40 --> 02:22:43.40
Yeah.

2626
02:22:43.40 --> 02:22:46.40
So in a way, because here, there are layers in that too.

2627
02:22:46.40 --> 02:22:49.40
And there is sophistication to that even though it seems simple.

2628
02:22:49.40 --> 02:22:50.40
Oh, because.

2629
02:22:50.40 --> 02:22:52.40
There I was being sophisticated.

2630
02:22:52.40 --> 02:22:53.40
You are being something out of it.

2631
02:22:53.40 --> 02:22:55.40
Because there's more to Jockel than just, oh, yeah.

2632
02:22:55.40 --> 02:22:57.40
That just happens to be my name.

2633
02:22:57.40 --> 02:22:58.40
There's two.

2634
02:22:58.40 --> 02:23:00.40
There's more to that goes beyond this podcast beyond the TV.

2635
02:23:00.40 --> 02:23:01.40
Whatever.

2636
02:23:01.40 --> 02:23:02.40
Right.

2637
02:23:02.40 --> 02:23:03.40
Okay.

2638
02:23:03.40 --> 02:23:05.40
So just let's just start with that fact, which is complex in and of itself.

2639
02:23:05.40 --> 02:23:07.40
Then you're like, okay.

2640
02:23:07.40 --> 02:23:12.40
Look, this is what roughly considered a company.

2641
02:23:12.40 --> 02:23:13.40
Technically.

2642
02:23:13.40 --> 02:23:14.40
Maybe.

2643
02:23:14.40 --> 02:23:15.40
I guess if you had to.

2644
02:23:15.40 --> 02:23:16.40
If you had to.

2645
02:23:16.40 --> 02:23:17.40
Okay.

2646
02:23:17.40 --> 02:23:17.40
That's me.

2647
02:23:17.40 --> 02:23:18.40
Okay.

2648
02:23:18.40 --> 02:23:19.40
What do I do?

2649
02:23:19.40 --> 02:23:20.40
Like for a living.

2650
02:23:20.40 --> 02:23:24.40
And I was like, I was like, oh, just like stuff.

2651
02:23:24.40 --> 02:23:25.40
Yeah.

2652
02:23:25.40 --> 02:23:26.40
And he goes, well, what would you?

2653
02:23:26.40 --> 02:23:27.40
How would you, what he said?

2654
02:23:27.40 --> 02:23:32.40
He said, well, how would you describe what you do?

2655
02:23:32.40 --> 02:23:35.40
And I said, stay busy.

2656
02:23:35.40 --> 02:23:36.40
That's what I do.

2657
02:23:36.40 --> 02:23:37.40
Yeah.

2658
02:23:37.40 --> 02:23:38.40
Okay.

2659
02:23:38.40 --> 02:23:39.40
Fair enough.

2660
02:23:39.40 --> 02:23:40.40
Yeah.

2661
02:23:40.40 --> 02:23:42.40
There you go.

2662
02:23:42.40 --> 02:23:44.40
But technically, because bar is.

2663
02:23:44.40 --> 02:23:46.40
I've never heard that one in a while.

2664
02:23:46.40 --> 02:23:48.40
Good.

2665
02:23:48.40 --> 02:23:50.40
Jockelpot.cast.com.

2666
02:23:50.40 --> 02:23:51.40
That's an entity.

2667
02:23:51.40 --> 02:23:52.40
I don't know.

2668
02:23:52.40 --> 02:23:53.40
Company business.

2669
02:23:53.40 --> 02:23:56.40
It's a place where we have the web.

2670
02:23:56.40 --> 02:23:57.40
It's not.

2671
02:23:57.40 --> 02:23:58.40
Nonetheless, oh, you know what?

2672
02:23:58.40 --> 02:24:01.40
I'm going to go ahead and out on a limb and call it a brand.

2673
02:24:01.40 --> 02:24:02.40
It's brand-dish.

2674
02:24:02.40 --> 02:24:03.40
Whatever.

2675
02:24:03.40 --> 02:24:08.40
Nonetheless, if you call, okay, well, Jockel store, that's the name of the store.

2676
02:24:08.40 --> 02:24:09.40
Yeah.

2677
02:24:09.40 --> 02:24:10.40
Well, that's true.

2678
02:24:10.40 --> 02:24:14.40
So, and to be honest with you, the reason that I called the podcast, Jockelpotcast,

2679
02:24:14.40 --> 02:24:17.40
when I was on Tim Ferriss's podcast, I said, Jockel Hungry.

2680
02:24:17.40 --> 02:24:18.40
I don't even know.

2681
02:24:18.40 --> 02:24:21.40
I don't know if I just said, I don't know if it's on the podcast or not.

2682
02:24:21.40 --> 02:24:24.40
But he, I think he says, oh, you know, we got to go to get some food.

2683
02:24:24.40 --> 02:24:25.40
And I was like, Jockel Hungry.

2684
02:24:25.40 --> 02:24:27.40
And then I was like, well, we're going to do a podcast record.

2685
02:24:27.40 --> 02:24:28.40
Jockelpotcast.

2686
02:24:28.40 --> 02:24:30.40
But that was the initial thought.

2687
02:24:30.40 --> 02:24:31.40
There's the layer.

2688
02:24:31.40 --> 02:24:32.40
Makes sense.

2689
02:24:32.40 --> 02:24:33.40
Yeah.

2690
02:24:33.40 --> 02:24:34.40
And that's it.

2691
02:24:34.40 --> 02:24:39.40
But even with naming the other words, I wanted to be able to do whatever I wanted to do

2692
02:24:39.40 --> 02:24:41.40
and not care.

2693
02:24:41.40 --> 02:24:42.40
Yeah.

2694
02:24:42.40 --> 02:24:43.40
And that makes sense.

2695
02:24:43.40 --> 02:24:48.40
I knew we were going to talk about Jockelpot and fighting in music and in hardcore and war and death.

2696
02:24:48.40 --> 02:24:52.40
And I just wanted to not have any limitations.

2697
02:24:52.40 --> 02:24:57.40
And the only way I could do that, because if you can give the podcast a name like, you know,

2698
02:24:57.40 --> 02:25:00.40
the, the, the, the, this podcast.

2699
02:25:00.40 --> 02:25:01.40
Yeah.

2700
02:25:01.40 --> 02:25:07.40
It's like, okay, well, then what I'm next to you know, we're talking about war and or if you call it the war podcast,

2701
02:25:07.40 --> 02:25:11.40
but you're talking about business or if you don't talk about the leadership podcast, but you're talking about

2702
02:25:11.40 --> 02:25:12.40
Jiu-Jitsu.

2703
02:25:12.40 --> 02:25:14.40
So how do you get all those things into one thing?

2704
02:25:14.40 --> 02:25:16.40
Call the Jockelpotcast and I can do whatever I want.

2705
02:25:16.40 --> 02:25:17.40
Yeah.

2706
02:25:17.40 --> 02:25:18.40
There you go.

2707
02:25:18.40 --> 02:25:22.40
And if people are looking for you, they see you talk about XYZ or like, you know, I sure I can look up.

2708
02:25:22.40 --> 02:25:23.40
XYZ.

2709
02:25:23.40 --> 02:25:24.40
Easy connection.

2710
02:25:24.40 --> 02:25:25.40
Yeah.

2711
02:25:25.40 --> 02:25:26.40
And it's simple.

2712
02:25:26.40 --> 02:25:27.40
You know, simply goes along with.

2713
02:25:27.40 --> 02:25:29.40
Yeah, you know, and that's kind of like a thing.

2714
02:25:29.40 --> 02:25:30.40
So why are we talking about this?

2715
02:25:30.40 --> 02:25:32.40
I'm just saying that's what it's called Jockelpotto.

2716
02:25:32.40 --> 02:25:33.40
Oh, yeah, that's right.

2717
02:25:33.40 --> 02:25:34.40
So because it is a story.

2718
02:25:34.40 --> 02:25:36.40
You know, people want to do other things in their life.

2719
02:25:36.40 --> 02:25:38.40
Besides, listen to our ancestors.

2720
02:25:38.40 --> 02:25:39.40
Well, you're the one chiming in.

2721
02:25:39.40 --> 02:25:41.40
And over here, don't talk about that.

2722
02:25:41.40 --> 02:25:46.40
I should've noticed that the other day when we had Roger Hayden on, and I gave you the silent treatment.

2723
02:25:46.40 --> 02:25:50.40
And when you looked at me for affirmation while you were giving the advertising,

2724
02:25:50.40 --> 02:25:51.40
I didn't even nod.

2725
02:25:51.40 --> 02:25:55.40
I just looked at you and you got, you actually got uncomfortable.

2726
02:25:55.40 --> 02:25:57.40
Yeah, you actually got uncomfortable.

2727
02:25:57.40 --> 02:25:59.40
You were like, maybe you look on your face.

2728
02:25:59.40 --> 02:26:02.40
Like, well, you look at me like I was going to give you a smile.

2729
02:26:02.40 --> 02:26:04.40
I know, I just look at you like hurry up.

2730
02:26:04.40 --> 02:26:06.40
And then you got uncomfortable.

2731
02:26:06.40 --> 02:26:08.40
And I said, well, he's starting to feel it.

2732
02:26:08.40 --> 02:26:09.40
Yeah, if you know, it works.

2733
02:26:09.40 --> 02:26:11.40
Yeah, that's like subtle.

2734
02:26:11.40 --> 02:26:12.40
Sure.

2735
02:26:12.40 --> 02:26:13.40
You know, man.

2736
02:26:13.40 --> 02:26:14.40
It's all good.

2737
02:26:14.40 --> 02:26:16.40
You know, so do that again right now.

2738
02:26:16.40 --> 02:26:18.40
You know, so I can talk about the story.

2739
02:26:18.40 --> 02:26:19.40
Jockels story.

02:26:19.40 --> 02:26:20.40
Jockels story.com.

2741
02:26:20.40 --> 02:26:21.40
If you like t-shirts.

2742
02:26:21.40 --> 02:26:24.40
No, I'm not saying if you like t-shirts in general.

2743
02:26:24.40 --> 02:26:28.40
I'm just saying, if you want to represent this clinical freedom,

2744
02:26:28.40 --> 02:26:29.40
what get after it.

2745
02:26:29.40 --> 02:26:32.40
No, the darkness.

2746
02:26:32.40 --> 02:26:33.40
No, the darkness.

2747
02:26:33.40 --> 02:26:35.40
That's a good one.

2748
02:26:35.40 --> 02:26:38.40
You know, anyway, go on the search.

2749
02:26:38.40 --> 02:26:39.40

2750
02:26:39.40 --> 02:26:41.40
You can see shirts if you like them.

2751
02:26:41.40 --> 02:26:43.40
Go ahead and get one support.

2752
02:26:43.40 --> 02:26:44.40
That's a good one.

2753
02:26:44.40 --> 02:26:45.40
I've got some rash cards on there.

2754
02:26:45.40 --> 02:26:48.40
One new rash card out already says get after it on it.

2755
02:26:48.40 --> 02:26:50.40
Discipline on one sleeve.

2756
02:26:50.40 --> 02:26:51.40
Freedom on the other sleeve.

2757
02:26:51.40 --> 02:26:52.40
Jockel approved.

2758
02:26:52.40 --> 02:26:53.40
Really good.

2759
02:26:53.40 --> 02:26:55.40
I think it's good.

2760
02:26:55.40 --> 02:27:00.40
I feel that the people who have witnessed it.

2761
02:27:00.40 --> 02:27:02.40
Is that pompous to say, witness it?

2762
02:27:02.40 --> 02:27:05.40
Like do some kind of a little bit of a lot.

2763
02:27:05.40 --> 02:27:06.40
Yeah, maybe you know a lot.

2764
02:27:06.40 --> 02:27:09.40
Anyone that's witnessed my rash card.

2765
02:27:09.40 --> 02:27:10.40
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2766
02:27:10.40 --> 02:27:13.40
That I bestowed upon them by way of visual.

2767
02:27:13.40 --> 02:27:16.40
How about people that thought it was a little pretty cool.

2768
02:27:16.40 --> 02:27:17.40
That was cool.

2769
02:27:17.40 --> 02:27:18.40
That was really cool.

2770
02:27:18.40 --> 02:27:19.40
That was cool.

2771
02:27:19.40 --> 02:27:20.40
And so there it is.

2772
02:27:20.40 --> 02:27:21.40
You go on the story.

2773
02:27:21.40 --> 02:27:22.40
Look at him.

2774
02:27:22.40 --> 02:27:28.40
If you think it's cool, you're going to want to witness the glory of echo Charles's rash cards.

2775
02:27:28.40 --> 02:27:33.40
You may go to jockelstore.com and revel in the glory.

2776
02:27:35.40 --> 02:27:37.40
Exactly right.

2777
02:27:37.40 --> 02:27:39.40
And whatever else you want, this is good stuff on there.

2778
02:27:39.40 --> 02:27:41.40
We added this little thing to if we're out.

2779
02:27:41.40 --> 02:27:44.40
And I'm sure they'd like, I'm kind of treestock, you know, re-stock.

2780
02:27:44.40 --> 02:27:45.40
Boom.

2781
02:27:45.40 --> 02:27:51.40
But I added this little thing where if like let's say the size medium or whatever is out,

2782
02:27:51.40 --> 02:27:53.40
it just says, oh, a little button.

2783
02:27:53.40 --> 02:27:54.40
Notify me.

2784
02:27:54.40 --> 02:27:55.40
But your email boom.

2785
02:27:55.40 --> 02:27:56.40
Notify as you when it's back in stock.

2786
02:27:56.40 --> 02:27:59.40
And again, I'm trying to put them back in stock.

2787
02:27:59.40 --> 02:28:00.40
Ace app.

2788
02:28:00.40 --> 02:28:01.40
Boom.

2789
02:28:01.40 --> 02:28:03.40
But, you know, give me a day or two or whatever.

2790
02:28:03.40 --> 02:28:05.40
I'll notify you.

2791
02:28:05.40 --> 02:28:06.40
Boom.

2792
02:28:06.40 --> 02:28:10.40
Also psychological warfare.

2793
02:28:10.40 --> 02:28:14.40
If you didn't know what that is, it's an album with tracks.

2794
02:28:14.40 --> 02:28:15.40
Come on.

2795
02:28:15.40 --> 02:28:17.40
Not music tracks.

2796
02:28:17.40 --> 02:28:19.40
Word tracks.

2797
02:28:19.40 --> 02:28:22.40
It's like spoken word.

2798
02:28:22.40 --> 02:28:25.40
You know, so basically what it's for is, you know, it's not like poetry.

2799
02:28:25.40 --> 02:28:28.40
Well, arguably not poetry, but Stockholm.

2800
02:28:28.40 --> 02:28:29.40
They're talking.

2801
02:28:29.40 --> 02:28:31.40
Talking to us to me.

2802
02:28:31.40 --> 02:28:33.40
Joc was talking to me.

2803
02:28:33.40 --> 02:28:36.40
That actually quite literally was talking to you when that was made.

2804
02:28:36.40 --> 02:28:37.40
Exactly right.

2805
02:28:37.40 --> 02:28:39.40
So, you know, you can have me talk to you.

2806
02:28:39.40 --> 02:28:42.40
So basically what it's for is he's not just talking.

2807
02:28:42.40 --> 02:28:43.40
Every day stuff.

2808
02:28:43.40 --> 02:28:47.40
So when you have hard time waking up in the morning or you have hard time because you're tired

2809
02:28:47.40 --> 02:28:51.40
and you want to skip the workout or you have hard time because, you know, it's lunchtime

2810
02:28:51.40 --> 02:28:55.40
and I'm all hungry and all they have is donuts here or whatever.

2811
02:28:55.40 --> 02:28:56.40
What else is there?

2812
02:28:56.40 --> 02:28:58.40
What if you're procrastinating?

2813
02:28:58.40 --> 02:29:01.40
Also, if you're procrastinating or what do you call it?

2814
02:29:01.40 --> 02:29:02.40
What if you're procrastinating?

2815
02:29:02.40 --> 02:29:03.40
What if you're procrastinating?

2816
02:29:03.40 --> 02:29:04.40
The podcast.

2817
02:29:04.40 --> 02:29:07.40
Maybe you could listen to that one right now.

2818
02:29:07.40 --> 02:29:08.40
We did.

2819
02:29:08.40 --> 02:29:10.40
I'm trying to explain this thoroughly.

2820
02:29:10.40 --> 02:29:14.40
So we can all have a really good understanding of what it is.

2821
02:29:14.40 --> 02:29:15.40
And it's value.

2822
02:29:15.40 --> 02:29:17.40
It's down over the moment.

2823
02:29:17.40 --> 02:29:21.40
Me talking about moments of weakness so you can get through them.

2824
02:29:21.40 --> 02:29:22.40
Yeah.

2825
02:29:22.40 --> 02:29:24.40
Next comment.

2826
02:29:24.40 --> 02:29:25.40
Yeah.

2827
02:29:25.40 --> 02:29:26.40
I guess.

2828
02:29:26.40 --> 02:29:28.40
Let me add this one more thing.

2829
02:29:28.40 --> 02:29:29.40
Oh.

2830
02:29:29.40 --> 02:29:33.40
Actually, you can even take it at moments of triumph and strength.

2831
02:29:33.40 --> 02:29:35.40
And it will still work.

2832
02:29:35.40 --> 02:29:37.40
You'll just want to do it more.

2833
02:29:37.40 --> 02:29:38.40
You know?

2834
02:29:38.40 --> 02:29:39.40
Yeah.

2835
02:29:39.40 --> 02:29:41.40
It's like drinking coffee when you're not tired.

2836
02:29:41.40 --> 02:29:42.40
You know what I mean?

2837
02:29:42.40 --> 02:29:43.40
Yeah.

2838
02:29:43.40 --> 02:29:44.40
Double down.

2839
02:29:44.40 --> 02:29:45.40
That's sink in.

2840
02:29:45.40 --> 02:29:46.40
It's like a lot of work.

2841
02:29:46.40 --> 02:29:47.40
It's like a lot of work.

2842
02:29:47.40 --> 02:29:48.40
Fair on iTunes.

2843
02:29:48.40 --> 02:29:49.40
Amazon music.

2844
02:29:49.40 --> 02:29:50.40
All these music.

2845
02:29:50.40 --> 02:29:51.40
Google play.

2846
02:29:51.40 --> 02:29:52.40
Google play.

2847
02:29:52.40 --> 02:29:53.40
I think it's on everything.

2848
02:29:53.40 --> 02:29:54.40
Cool.

2849
02:29:54.40 --> 02:29:55.40
But yeah, man.

2850
02:29:55.40 --> 02:29:56.40
Do it.

2851
02:29:56.40 --> 02:29:57.40
Right on.

2852
02:29:57.40 --> 02:29:58.40
All right.

2853
02:29:58.40 --> 02:29:59.40
Also, you can get jacquo white tea on Amazon.

2854
02:29:59.40 --> 02:30:07.40
And when you order jacquo white tea, make sure you also order more weights for your barbells.

2855
02:30:07.40 --> 02:30:11.40
Because your deadlift is going to go up to approximately 8,000 pounds.

2856
02:30:11.40 --> 02:30:14.40
So you need to get that much weights when you order it.

2857
02:30:14.40 --> 02:30:16.40
Way the warrior kid.

2858
02:30:16.40 --> 02:30:17.40
Book.

2859
02:30:17.40 --> 02:30:20.40
It's been out for a couple weeks now.

2860
02:30:20.40 --> 02:30:23.40
And thank you for getting it.

2861
02:30:23.40 --> 02:30:30.40
Also, a little warning that someone put on Amazon in their review.

2862
02:30:30.40 --> 02:30:33.40
I thought it was worth hearing and thinking about parents.

2863
02:30:33.40 --> 02:30:34.40
Be ready.

2864
02:30:34.40 --> 02:30:37.40
I bought this book after listening to jacquo on the Joe Rogan podcast where jacquo was the guest.

2865
02:30:37.40 --> 02:30:40.40
Great podcast bought the book after learning jacquo has a book for kids.

2866
02:30:40.40 --> 02:30:45.40
My son who isn't very motivated yet was excited about the book.

2867
02:30:45.40 --> 02:30:48.40
When he started reading the book, a fire lit underneath him.

2868
02:30:48.40 --> 02:30:51.40
He said to me, dad, I'm going to get up tomorrow at 5 a.m.

2869
02:30:51.40 --> 02:30:53.40
Will you get up with me?

2870
02:30:53.40 --> 02:30:57.40
And that moment I realized that I was going what was going on.

2871
02:30:57.40 --> 02:30:59.40
And I couldn't let him down.

2872
02:30:59.40 --> 02:31:02.40
I enjoy my sleep like everyone else.

2873
02:31:02.40 --> 02:31:05.40
But I was amazed that my son got excited to order a pie.

2874
02:31:05.40 --> 02:31:06.40
Yes, let's do it.

2875
02:31:06.40 --> 02:31:07.40
Got up at 5 a.m.

2876
02:31:07.40 --> 02:31:11.40
And there's a alarm clock must not have gone off, but I turned on his light and his bedroom.

2877
02:31:11.40 --> 02:31:12.40
And he got right up.

2878
02:31:12.40 --> 02:31:15.40
He got his clothes and shoes on and we went for a jog.

2879
02:31:15.40 --> 02:31:17.40
We've never done this before.

2880
02:31:17.40 --> 02:31:21.40
I had him do some sit ups and pushups after and he gladly did.

2881
02:31:21.40 --> 02:31:23.40
Couldn't quite do pushups if that's okay.

2882
02:31:23.40 --> 02:31:25.40
We'll get there.

2883
02:31:25.40 --> 02:31:26.40
Long story short.

2884
02:31:26.40 --> 02:31:28.40
This book only being a few chapters.

2885
02:31:28.40 --> 02:31:29.40
And he only a few chapters in.

2886
02:31:29.40 --> 02:31:30.40
That was kind of surprise.

2887
02:31:30.40 --> 02:31:31.40
I saw that.

2888
02:31:31.40 --> 02:31:32.40
Only a few chapters in.

2889
02:31:32.40 --> 02:31:34.40
Made the book worth getting.

2890
02:31:34.40 --> 02:31:39.40
In this day and age of electronics and iPads and tablets kids don't seem to be as motivated

2891
02:31:39.40 --> 02:31:41.40
to do activities as when I was a kid.

2892
02:31:41.40 --> 02:31:42.40
I'm 39.

2893
02:31:42.40 --> 02:31:47.40
So I edified him after for making the decision to get up at 5 a.m.

2894
02:31:47.40 --> 02:31:48.40
on a non school day.

2895
02:31:48.40 --> 02:31:52.40
And I told him that he can apply that mentality to anything in life.

2896
02:31:52.40 --> 02:31:53.40
Boom.

2897
02:31:53.40 --> 02:31:54.40
Way the warrior kid.

2898
02:31:54.40 --> 02:31:55.40
Get it for your kid.

2899
02:31:55.40 --> 02:31:58.40
Be prepared to get yourself back in the game.

2900
02:31:58.40 --> 02:32:01.40

Also extreme ownership combat leadership.

2904
02:32:10.40 --> 02:32:14.40
Combat leadership and also combat leadership.

2905
02:32:14.40 --> 02:32:16.40
That's what the book is about.

2906
02:32:16.40 --> 02:32:20.40

02:33:08.40 --> 02:33:11.40
In the Austin, Master, there's only 300 seats.

2919
02:33:11.40 --> 02:33:13.40
Smaller venue.

2920
02:33:13.40 --> 02:33:16.40
It's going to sell out.

2921
02:33:16.40 --> 02:33:19.40

To police, law enforcement, firefighters, EMTs and other first responders.

Remember what human beings are capable of suffering through and remember that even in those situations.

2933
02:34:25.40 --> 02:34:34.40
Where everything seems to be taken away, when you seem to have no choice at all in the world.

2934
02:34:34.40 --> 02:34:42.40
Remember that you can still choose how you react to the things around you.

2935
02:34:42.40 --> 02:34:47.40
You can still choose your attitude.

2936
02:34:47.40 --> 02:34:57.40
And you can still choose to actualize the best person that you can be.

2937
02:34:57.40 --> 02:35:07.40
