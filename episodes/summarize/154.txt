they're getting it from million different directions and you gotta be careful with it because that's a real that can be turned into a real problem and the thing that that actually you clarified really good to me one day where when you kind of implement change you know in a routine is especially if snacking is kind of like a routine you know whatever when you implement change like it's good there's gonna be some hiccups there you know like whether be I don't know in this case like complaining like I think what you're gonna do is put this you know like kind of like you're so done it you get this feeling I'm not saying this you want to know why your brother or you or whoever can look at that problem and like come up with a solution it's because they're detached they're de facto detached from the problem so when you're all wrapped up in the problem you're like a head or no way to do because I got this this and this your brother's like well just do that and you're like you get mad you know but everything else is just sort of hey I'm leaving day by day doing the best I can't kind of think but if you can whether be right it down or whatever if you can have it in your brain consciously that or remember essentially like what these goals are it makes it a lot more clear and then the more you kind of follow those goals the more it becomes like habit like you just what I think check next question how do the finest civilian leaders differ from the finest military leaders or in other words what character traits do military leaders develop that are more difficult or rare for civilian leaders to develop there really the leadership is leadership and the good civilian leaders have the same good qualities that the good military leaders have and vice versa and life life was talking about this the other day that you know he he tells people like hey man I wish you were in the military wish you you would have been good you know you would have been a good infantry officer you would be good sealed platoon leader that would have been cool if you were in teams because you're a good leader in the civilians after you're a good leader in the you'd be a good leader in the military so there's no so you got to be really careful about what you're doing with the kid with a with a little girl guess what little girls little boys guess what they are when they're when they're little the little pudgy little creatures you know and sure there'll be some genetic kids that are have 2% body fat and a 12 pack of abs when they're 6 years old but most kids are like little little bit pudgy that's part of their prepping for their growths perk and if you're all freaked out about it you know just what you're gonna do is you're gonna put that in their head they're gonna start looking in the mirror and you don't want to do that to your kids so don't have any junk food snacks in the house give them some milk right give them some warrior kid milk because it tastes delicious it is like a snack and it's good for them and it'll be it'll be satiating I know you don't like that word echo and I I think I understand a question but here's the here's the tip that I'm been married forever but significantly long here's what I found out like a lot of stuff like as a guy you think like hey I'm not really gonna do that because like that's not important you know like you you have a set of things that you think are important and they're based on certain ways of thinking then the girls gonna have things she thinks is important and in my experience which I from what I understand is very common that the things that some girls think are important they can't really put their finger on it or why they feel important or whatever hey we'll make it work it's not a fair deal it's gonna be problematic you don't want to present me with unfair deals because I will not be accepting them also does it seem like this moral question I guess you you kind of got to like be truthful to yourself like consciously too right because when you could you give it like how you say you gotta ask yourself is this is this good for me and my ego or is this good for the team like as far as me not compromising my you know who not compromising or my personal code or whatever but if you don't really have an intentional like goal it's hard to just kind of float there and be like I need to be I don't know vaguely success what's like it's it makes the whole deal harder and it's a lot of times like a normal person would they don't have specific goals for every aspect of their life you know they'll have one in maybe with their career something like that or fitness or something like that and that's kind of the point where like I'm trying to gain an understanding you know because easy when your detachments first in his like why are you complaining about like because this is like you feel the front of your mind you're like why are you complaining about this why don't you just solve that problem and never complain about it ever again you know that's the feeling the other person have that detached person the you know in this case um the husband and whatever so what I did was I imagine my situation that I'm on the other side but you can have that exact attitude be like cool that's what we're doing that's cool because some people you bow on the mat you bow off the mat you at the beginner class to the you know to the picture whatever at the end like the whole deal but same deal it's like bowing's not hard to do it doesn't like you know affect your family life at home or nothing like that it's just just bow same thing that's not my gig or I it's respect you got about like there's both those extremes and both of them can be articulated in a way that's fine and to me I'm just like whatever oh everyone looks like everyone's bound cool in the bow and not that big of a deal I don't I don't freak out about it it's not that big of a deal I think it to me to me the overall arching principle of my actions bowing or not bowing is more based on my overall principle of not making a spectacle out of myself one way or the other like I'm not here to like draw attention and be like but I think it's easy to sort it forget when especially if you're thinking like this which is which I dig man is the whole what am I gonna do to fix it because when you when you like for real take ownership whatever it's because man just like I said it's almost like what you just said where where you say you can't blame me you can't blame me because I already took responsibility kind of thing because and in a big way it's not necessarily about blame it's more about fixing problems that course on a come up nothing's perfect you know so that's a bunch of things I'll continue to push that as much as I can and I know a ton of law enforcement people listen to this and just you know I think that's a great idea to start pushing from the ground from the grassroots we want one fifth of our time training it's going to make us all better it's going to prevent think of all the time that's hours that are wasted in legal actions after there's a bad shooting or an injury or something like that think of all the stuff that gets wasted there take the officers and train them properly that's what that's what needs to happen so hopefully it will and then what would you suggest that I mean kind of isn't what you can say but suggest like you know police officers going and getting training on their own that's why cut back I don't I say don't cut back to stop you check next question communication is often used as an excuse both under and over oh under communication and over communication for why the direction isn't clear any suggestions on balancing comms communication up and down with the right level of detail here's a jacked up answer the answer to this question of how to balance comms is comms you own balance communication you have to communicate you have to understand hey do you guys know what's going on you need to check and make sure that they know what's going on if they know what's going on great if they don't know then you didn't communicate with them enough if you spent too much time communicating and now they're looking at you with a blank stare like hey bro we got this then you communicated too much so and ask them hey do you understand what's going on cool and you think about it then you'll get better at it and the cool thing is like once you start to build some confidence then you get more and more confident and you'll get better and better it the other thing I would say is talk about things that you know right don't try and explain things that you don't know don't try and come up with some theory that you don't understand and try and just roll it out off the tip of your tongue because you don't know it so just when that's happening just sit back and kind of formulate your thoughts and think okay of all the things I'm thinking right now what do I actually kind of have a grip on maybe it's a question sometimes forming something in a question will make it easier for you to state it because you're saying hey I got a question I was training like at a higher level and I mean like seriously not trying to be like a jerk but like I would this is back when I was training training with Fabio and so Dean and I would choke when we trained for like three hours straight and like hard you know I'm going to buds and I'm getting married this summer before I go straight up that's a bad idea that's a bad idea don't do that if you're not situation don't do that because if you are if you have a great relationship with that person say look I'm gonna go through buds I'm gonna be focused on that it's gonna take me some time I'm gonna show bit of team I'm gonna go on deployment I'm gonna come home it's gonna take about three years for all this to happen when we get done with all when I get done with all that we'll get married because we are so strong and so tight that we can get through three years without you know being married we cool I mean I think that helps but that's gonna be hard either way if you don't have some kind of like format scaffolding in your brain to kind of like a plan you know like a little strategy to be like but and then what if hypothetically later he found out like who that was and he'd like occasionally I've had people say things like like they kind of know who should I say like I don't know whatever this whole what could have been kind of deal that's like your mind saying like right now if I would have done that back then right now I would have this and that's the part that kind of message like jams you up mentally right where you're like man I could have had this right now all right that's what you're life's hell is intense and intentional how do I even get started living like that let's just break this down real easy okay number one if you want to live like more focused in your life choose to decide that you're going to actually live like that do that right down whatever it is you want to do and then before you go to bed at night right down some things that you're gonna do tomorrow they're gonna help you move towards the goals that you have and then set your alarm clock for early in the morning wake up and do the things that you wrote down stay on that path that's it yeah someone talking too much another guy stops listening are you over communicating so far in this spot it's not you know I'm just saying like how you say like feedback you know like that that's an important thing because if you're like blah but I just thought it was funny because you think you think I'm gonna do squats today then I'm just gonna go beyond the normal man being a brute look the being a brute that part I can see that you know because you know like let's say like you gained 20 pounds 30 pounds it's just and it's like all muscle right I just keep everything a surprise because I'm not here like hey you know I do jitsu you better back off you know like what is that and then said you're just like hey man all good you know so that's part one part two is what are you going to do plan a tree today that's what you're going to do plan a tree today and start to nourish that tree and take the lessons that you learned to sprinkle on that tree and feed that tree so it can grow fast that tree that you plant today should be able to grow faster than the one you would have planned 20 years ago because you have the knowledge on how to on how to nourish that tree and feed that tree so it can grow quicker so just get on the path don't don't play around with what's going on in the past learn from it move on you man that goes along with how like that little speech it wasn't a speech but a little talk you had with me about you know you got to play the long game or whatever and in kind of in this case same deal where it's kind of in more so than even play that you are playing the long game but keep the long game in mind because that's what you know those thoughts like dang maybe I'll not do this whole thing right now I remember thinking the same thing is you like dank those are really dope what it's saying you know plus like you know that that guy obviously he didn't know who that was I'm assuming which would be kind of crazy if he didn't or if he did know who he was I think if like you can keep that long game in mind that's helped me like a lot with just even like small little things you know stuff is like uncomfortable I want to do this right now but you could probably do it because you're a little bit better at this kind of thing you just don't just do that well that's a good tactic right there when you say like like what you what you kind of do kind of like you're like one of these individuals one of the rare people who knows how to deal with it what what is that I don't how do you overcome that be nice to your you know your girlfriend whoa you know wife um what's the your romantic partner like what does that mean no like with if you're working out with your romantic partner or like you're getting bigger and faster and stronger and therefore you start treating your girlfriend like crap but you know this exact thought like man I'm I'm looking forward to the day that I'm not I'm thinking the opposite of what could have been I'm thinking now I'm thinking I'm so glad I planted that seed last year or whatever you know so you can look at the long game and kind of fulfill all that stuff sure all right anyway next question hi jockel and echo and name is both by the way here but hi jockel and echo quick question I really get I get really bad anxiety doing almost everything for example when talking to people I always feel like as if I'm gonna say something stupid and this makes me start to stutter and lose my train of thought yeah either the hard way or someone will be like hey man you know that guy that you keep messing with like I train jitsu every day he's gonna choke you up put you to sleep and then guess what he's gonna do he's gonna be a mouthy because he's already been he's already been testing you Like out to 85 to 100% impactful, like every little thing, like that felt like applied to me where I can like, whether it be an idea or talking about your daughter.
