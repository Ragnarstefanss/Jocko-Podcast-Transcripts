I mean, I'm not a parent, so I don't, I don't totally get that, you know, that side of things, but I mean, my dad, again, one of the things, I mean, I'll get into the nitty-goody of it because I'm transparent, but so on, June 23, 2012, like, if you're going to kill yourself, you're not going to, you're not going to tell anybody. So he has all these tattoos kind of like you except his are like notes, you know, like, like, yourself. And when I don't have that happening, that's that's like, when I don't have that happening, I, it's like, when I don't notice any improvement, I, I start feeling like, oh, no, like I can see, I'm on the wrong path right now. I mean, I don't know any, like, I can't remember what it's like anymore to like snowboard with two legs or a busted up leg. But first, well, you know, like throughout the story, you know, there's little pockets of maybe like, oh wait, well, you know, small detail. You know, certain areas, you know, Lashcarga, you know, I'm Lisa Kloan, all of that, like sure those areas, like for lack of better terms. Like you have at least this, like, I mean, I, the same, I mean, I surf and like I live by the beach. Like, we're going to go in and we're going to try and do whether it was bone crafting or neuro decompression or whatever, what it was like, we don't even know we're going to find any more. I mean when you look at those pictures when you see and Hillary step has changed I think in 2015 it changed from like this big kind of a like a 10 meter like 12 meter something rock. But no, I mean, the moment, like, three days into the actual, like, base camp track, I saw Everest for the first time and I just knew, like, that's it. But it was one of those things where it was, I mean, in a sick way, like, just like I was addicted to school, I sort of get addicted to that suffering, because like you suffer in your miserable, for days on end. And I'm thinking, wow, like, it, you grow up so much between the ages of 16, 17 and like, even 22 and then 22, 25, like, you don't know a lot when you're 17 years old. It seems like, you know, like when you say, okay, it depends on how you react to like all these things. As these things are happening, because the reason I kind of have to say that is because then you like do other things at the same time, like getting stunt women and getting crashed and blown up and stuff like that. No, like, well, I think what worried me was, like I said, the fact that everybody was looking at it and being like, we're not going to do anything about it. but yeah, like you know how you say it, or you've talked about this before, where if you're handed everything, yeah, you know, like you won't go case important. But that's like, I just wanted to show people that it was okay, you know, like, you don't have to be the cookie cutter, you know, definition of what beautiful is. And to me, that's not what Mal and Irina is, you know, like, in my opinion, like that totally discredits, but what all it should be, um, you know, I'm glad that I was out there with me and my thoughts and literally two other people. Um, and so I mean, even after we made it back down to base camp, I mean, coming down like through camp 3 and 2, like, I was so at peace with everything because I'm watching these zoos of people come up. So, you know, this really is, it's just about paying it forward and helping, you know, get the adaptive community into the outdoors and hopefully encouraging, you know, other people regardless of whatever you're adversity that you're facing, you know, to go outside and, you know, and find what really sets your heart on fire. And I don't want to say the cheesy, like, you know, beauty comes from within, but I like, I wanted to show people that it was, I mean, it was beautiful to be strong. Is there still, is that because you've been hiking in the mountains so much you've been doing so much that you're feeling like you're conditioning is good or is it like, is it like when you fight in MMA or you run a triathlon where when you get done you okay at a recover a little bit? I mean, I growing up, I would like for for a long time, some of my family was like, oh, God, she's going to be a social worker. Yeah, I mean, it is, but like for me especially, I mean, for any mountaineer, it's like building box. And so, I mean, it was just, I don't know, like a weird hunger from more that I wasn't really like finding any worlds. Like, just like normally, like as a as a door gunner, you're the eyes and the ears for the pilot. It's like your reaction is like you chose to go for like these huge reactions. Um, and so like, moving forward, I just decided that I was going to own my differences, that I was going to like be proud of the scars that I wore because they told my stories. I mean, I'm not like, when I think of any of the things that I've done at this point, it's like, you don't want to be celebrated. I mean, and I had a, I have, I had like a little, this weird caviar, like carbon fiber contraption that basically took all of the weight off of my lower limb and put it all into my knee at the time. But on the other, I think the other side is that to like, even right now when I do eventually finish this doctor, like I'm terrified of what I'm going to do with that time. I mean, I'd be wrong, like, when I got back down to base camp, but definitely, I was like, do you have any to do another attempt? I mean, as if I couldn't get any lower, you know, him saying that I was like, you know what? I mean, even though your days are varied between, you know, what your maintenance schedule or what your flight schedule looks like, it's, I mean, it's pretty freaking straightforward. But as far as like the physical aspect of it, you know, I just reminded myself like I'm getting to play for 13 weeks. It's like naked, you know, like that kind. Also, I thought, you know, that we mentioned like how you'd have, um, like challenges with your memory. Like just going to the bathroom, like hey, why am I here kind of think? But then I mean this time, like I just looked down at Rob and was like, no, I was at total peace with this situation. In my mind, this is big, but not as big as like whatever, but yeah, things that as I guess, and like it made me realize that I was impacting a lot more people.
