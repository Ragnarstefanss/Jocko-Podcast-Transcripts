[00:00:00] This is Jockelpontcast number 214.
[00:00:03] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:06] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:07] Good evening.
[00:00:08] Dear George, at 0700 this morning,
[00:00:14] the BBC announced that the German radio had just come out
[00:00:18] with an announcement of the landing of Allied paratroops
[00:00:23] and of large numbers of assault craft near the shore.
[00:00:26] So that is it.
[00:00:29] This group of unconscribable heroes
[00:00:33] whom I command are not in yet, but we will be soon.
[00:00:37] I wish I was there now as it is a lovely sunny day for battle
[00:00:41] and I am fed up with just sitting.
[00:00:44] I have no immediate idea of being killed,
[00:00:47] but one can never tell and none of us can live forever.
[00:00:50] So if I should go, don't worry, but set yourself
[00:00:54] to do better than I have.
[00:00:57] All men are timid on entering any fight.
[00:01:00] Whether it is the first fight or the last fight,
[00:01:03] all of us are timid.
[00:01:06] Cowards are those who let their timidity
[00:01:08] get the better of their manhood.
[00:01:12] You will never do that because of your bloodlines
[00:01:14] on both sides.
[00:01:16] I think I've told you the story of Marshall Torraine
[00:01:20] who fought under Louis XIV.
[00:01:24] On the morning of one of his last battles,
[00:01:27] he had been fighting for 40 years.
[00:01:29] He was mounting his horse when a young aide
[00:01:31] to camp who had just come from the court
[00:01:34] and had never missed a meal or heard a hostile shot.
[00:01:37] Said Mr. Torraine, it amazes me
[00:01:40] that a man of your supposed courage
[00:01:42] should permit his knees to tremble
[00:01:45] as he walks out to Mount.
[00:01:48] Torraine replied,
[00:01:49] my Lord Duke, I admit that my Nate knees do tremble.
[00:01:52] But should they know where I shall this day take them,
[00:01:57] they would shake even more?
[00:02:01] That is it.
[00:02:03] Your knees may shake,
[00:02:04] but they will always take you toward the enemy.
[00:02:08] Well, so much for that.
[00:02:10] There are apparently two types of successful soldiers.
[00:02:13] Those who get on by being unobtrusive
[00:02:17] and those who get on by being obtrusive.
[00:02:19] I am of the latter type and seem to be rare
[00:02:24] and unpopular, but it is my method.
[00:02:26] One has to choose a system and stick to it.
[00:02:30] People who are not themselves are nobody.
[00:02:35] To be a successful soldier, you must know history.
[00:02:40] Read it objectively.
[00:02:43] Dates and even the minute details of tactics are useless.
[00:02:48] What you must know is how man reacts.
[00:02:54] Weapons change, but man who uses them changes not at all.
[00:03:01] To win battles, you do not beat weapons.
[00:03:04] You beat the soul of man of the enemy.
[00:03:10] To do that, you have to destroy his weapons,
[00:03:13] but that is only incidental.
[00:03:15] You must read biography
[00:03:16] and especially autobiography.
[00:03:19] If you do that, it will, you will find that war is simple.
[00:03:25] Decide what will hurt the enemy most
[00:03:27] within the limits of your capabilities to harm him
[00:03:30] and then do it.
[00:03:32] Take calculated risks.
[00:03:34] That is quite different from being rash.
[00:03:37] My personal belief is that if you have a 50% chance,
[00:03:41] take it because of the superior fighting qualities
[00:03:44] of American soldiers lead me, led by me,
[00:03:47] will surely give you the extra 1% necessary.
[00:03:52] Incidentally, I decided as a result of my information
[00:03:54] observations and a sixth sense that I have
[00:03:57] that the enemy did not have another large scale
[00:04:00] attack in his system.
[00:04:02] I bet my shirt on that and I was right.
[00:04:06] You cannot make war safely, but no dead general
[00:04:10] has ever been criticized.
[00:04:12] So you have that way out always.
[00:04:16] I am sure that if every leader who goes into battle
[00:04:19] will promise himself that he will either come out
[00:04:22] a conqueror or a corpse, he is sure to win.
[00:04:28] There is no doubt of that.
[00:04:31] Defeat is not due to losses,
[00:04:33] but to the destruction of the soul of the leaders.
[00:04:37] The most vital quality a soldier can possess
[00:04:47] is self-confidence, utter, complete and bumpuous.
[00:04:52] You can have doubts about your good looks,
[00:04:54] about your intelligence, about your self-control,
[00:04:56] but to win in war, you must have no doubts
[00:04:59] about your ability as a soldier.
[00:05:03] What success I have had results from the fact
[00:05:06] that I have always been certain that my military
[00:05:08] reactions were correct.
[00:05:11] Many people do not agree with me.
[00:05:13] They are wrong.
[00:05:15] The un-airing jury of history written long after both of us
[00:05:20] are dead will prove me correct.
[00:05:23] Note that I speak of military reactions.
[00:05:26] No one is born with them anymore than anyone is born
[00:05:28] with muscles.
[00:05:31] You can be born with the soul capable of correct military
[00:05:34] reactions or the body capable of having big muscles,
[00:05:38] but both qualities must be developed by hard work.
[00:05:44] The intensity of your desire to acquire
[00:05:46] any special ability depends on character, on ambition.
[00:05:51] I think that your decision to study this summer
[00:05:53] instead of enjoying yourself shows
[00:05:55] that you have character and ambition.
[00:05:58] And they are wonderful possessions.
[00:06:01] Soldiers, all men in fact are natural hero worshippers.
[00:06:07] Officers with a flare for command realize this
[00:06:11] and emphasize in their conduct, dress and deportment.
[00:06:15] The qualities they seek to produce in their men.
[00:06:20] When I was a second lieutenant,
[00:06:22] I had a captain who was very sloppy and usually late.
[00:06:25] He got after his men for just those faults.
[00:06:30] He was a failure.
[00:06:32] The troops I have commanded have always been well dressed,
[00:06:37] been smart saluters, been prompt and bold and action
[00:06:40] because I have personally set the example in these qualities.
[00:06:44] The influence one man can have on thousands
[00:06:48] is a never-ending source of wonder to me.
[00:06:50] You are always on parade.
[00:06:53] Officers who through laziness or a foolish desire
[00:06:59] to be popular fail to enforce discipline
[00:07:02] and the proper wearing of uniforms and equipment,
[00:07:05] not in the presence of the enemy,
[00:07:06] will also fail in battle.
[00:07:11] And if they fail in battle, they are potential mergers.
[00:07:17] There is no such thing as a good field soldier.
[00:07:20] You are either a good soldier or a bad soldier.
[00:07:26] Well, this has been quite a sermon,
[00:07:30] but don't get the idea that it is my swan song
[00:07:33] because it is not.
[00:07:36] I have not finished my job yet.
[00:07:42] Signed your affectionate father.
[00:07:47] And that right there, if you haven't guessed
[00:07:49] as a letter from General George S. Patent
[00:07:52] to his son, the George as the day unfolded.
[00:07:57] And as you can see from the letter
[00:08:01] and also if you know anything about Patent,
[00:08:03] at all he was well known, not only for his skill and battle
[00:08:07] and as a tactician and as a leader, but also well known
[00:08:12] for his ego.
[00:08:15] Let me read this part again.
[00:08:17] The most vital quality a soldier can possess
[00:08:19] his self confidence, utter complete and bump to us.
[00:08:24] And what bump truss means is is proud to a degree
[00:08:29] where it's irritating.
[00:08:30] So it means what it sounds like, right?
[00:08:32] And he's saying that's how you need to be.
[00:08:34] He continues on, you can have doubts about your good looks
[00:08:37] about your intelligence, about your self control,
[00:08:39] but to win in war you must have no doubts
[00:08:41] about your ability as a soldier.
[00:08:43] What success I have had results from the fact
[00:08:47] that I have always been certain
[00:08:49] that my military reactions were correct.
[00:08:52] Many people do not agree with me, they are wrong.
[00:08:54] Now, that's obviously very contrary to what I think,
[00:09:02] which is the most important characteristic
[00:09:06] for a leader to have is humility.
[00:09:09] So we're actually saying the exact opposite things here.
[00:09:12] I mean straight up the opposite things.
[00:09:14] He's saying the most important thing is self confidence,
[00:09:16] but he doesn't say self confidence.
[00:09:17] He says utter and complete and bump truss.
[00:09:20] That's what he says.
[00:09:22] That's not, that's not humility.
[00:09:25] So where does this wash out?
[00:09:32] We have to remember that the patent's career was not unblumished.
[00:09:36] And this is the thing that I'm gonna keep kind of tying
[00:09:39] this back to.
[00:09:41] A lot of the things that I think
[00:09:42] you remember when we did
[00:09:46] Chairman Mao and we talked about
[00:09:49] Chairman Mao and his methodology for winning in guerrilla war.
[00:09:53] And everything that he said,
[00:09:57] well, it wasn't like aligned with what I say.
[00:10:00] And what are the key components of that?
[00:10:02] Maybe not everything, but a lot of what he was saying
[00:10:04] and I'd have to review it again,
[00:10:05] but a lot of what he was saying,
[00:10:07] but one thing that he absolutely said,
[00:10:10] Chairman Mao, father of communist China,
[00:10:16] said all throughout that the leaders in the field
[00:10:19] need to make decisions, they need to step up,
[00:10:22] they need to lead at what he's talking about
[00:10:23] his decentralized command.
[00:10:25] And what puzzles me about that is
[00:10:27] because he recognized that you needed to have decentralized
[00:10:30] command for a military victory, right to win.
[00:10:35] But then he never transposed that idea
[00:10:38] of decentralized command into his government.
[00:10:40] And we actually do know that centralized government
[00:10:44] doesn't work any better than centralized military
[00:10:47] command than centralized business leadership.
[00:10:49] It doesn't work.
[00:10:51] So he never made that connection apparently.
[00:10:54] And sometimes when I read about patent,
[00:10:56] if you know about patent,
[00:10:59] and you know about his career
[00:11:00] and you know what happened to him,
[00:11:02] sometimes you, it hurts a little bit to know
[00:11:07] that this guy who was such a great patriot,
[00:11:10] who was such a great tactician,
[00:11:11] that if he could have applied some of his principles
[00:11:14] of leadership on the battlefield,
[00:11:15] if he could have applied those to his interactions
[00:11:20] with other people, he might have ended up
[00:11:23] in a much better position.
[00:11:27] And we'll get into some of that.
[00:11:28] Some of the things that he did,
[00:11:31] one, there was an attack on a place called Fort Giante,
[00:11:37] in the fall of 1944.
[00:11:38] And I got this little, I wanted to kind of summarize it.
[00:11:41] And there's a thing called the warfare history network
[00:11:44] that summarized it very well.
[00:11:46] It said the entire operation gradually settled
[00:11:48] into a stalemate with the Americans
[00:11:50] unable to achieve any further gains
[00:11:52] and the men hanging on desperately
[00:11:54] to what had been won in the hard fighting.
[00:11:57] Food, water, and ammunition were running out
[00:11:59] and the men holding positions underground
[00:12:02] were exposed to the dust and fumes of the tunnels
[00:12:05] by October 9th, Patent's attitude about the attack
[00:12:08] had changed completely.
[00:12:10] He said the show is going sour, we will have to pull out.
[00:12:16] It had quickly become a no win situation for the Americans
[00:12:18] because both daylight and nocturnal salts had failed.
[00:12:22] Daytime attacks were vulnerable to the deadly fire
[00:12:24] that rained down on Fort Giante from the adjacent forts
[00:12:28] at night assaults were quickly broken up
[00:12:30] and driven into confusion when the German squads
[00:12:33] emerged from their underground tunnels.
[00:12:35] The third army suffered 64 men killed 547 wounded,
[00:12:39] 187 missing assumed captured,
[00:12:43] so and not achieving the objective.
[00:12:45] So that's not good, right?
[00:12:48] So the idea to think that everything I think of is correct.
[00:12:54] And there you go, even Patent, guess what he had to do?
[00:12:57] He had to go, okay, this isn't working.
[00:12:59] He might not like to admit that,
[00:13:01] but he had to work and do well.
[00:13:02] And let's just not do this.
[00:13:05] Another thing he did, he orchestrated a raid
[00:13:10] on a POW camp called O'Flog 13B.
[00:13:17] It was impolent.
[00:13:18] And there's, I'm not going to go into the details now,
[00:13:21] but he actually thought that perhaps his son-in-law
[00:13:23] was a prisoner there.
[00:13:24] And so he organized this raid and a guy named Abraham Baum,
[00:13:32] conducted the raid, 300 men went on the mission,
[00:13:36] of which 32 were confirmed killed in action
[00:13:40] and another 200 over 200 were missing or taken prisoner
[00:13:45] and only 35 of the 300 made it back to friendly lines.
[00:13:50] So that is not good.
[00:13:52] And then on top of that, here's where I look at
[00:13:56] and I say if he would have had more humility.
[00:13:59] And once again, I gotta say this, right?
[00:14:02] Cause I talk about humility all the time.
[00:14:03] There's a reason that I talk about humility, it's all time.
[00:14:05] Okay, in the dichotomy of leadership,
[00:14:06] can you be too humble?
[00:14:07] Echo Charles, can you be too humble?
[00:14:08] Yes.
[00:14:09] Yes, you can.
[00:14:10] Can you have too much confidence?
[00:14:12] Yes, that becomes arrogant, it's an ego, that's bad.
[00:14:14] The reason that I talk about humility so much
[00:14:16] is because it is the of the two leanings
[00:14:20] that people can make in the dichotomy most of the time,
[00:14:24] most of the time, it's their two confidence.
[00:14:27] That's most of the time, right?
[00:14:29] Cause if you have someone that's moving into a leadership
[00:14:30] position, they have to have some confidence to get there.
[00:14:33] So therefore, a person in leadership position
[00:14:35] is gonna lean towards having confidence,
[00:14:37] which is gonna lean them towards if they're gonna be
[00:14:40] either not confident enough or too confident,
[00:14:42] they're gonna lean towards too much confidence, right?
[00:14:44] Because the person that lacks confident
[00:14:45] will they're not in the leadership position?
[00:14:47] They didn't work to didn't maneuver
[00:14:48] to get the they didn't believe in themselves.
[00:14:50] So they didn't really get there.
[00:14:51] Are there times where you have to talk to a leader
[00:14:53] about hey, you need more confidence,
[00:14:55] you need to be less humble, absolutely.
[00:14:56] There are times.
[00:14:57] But Pat and clearly,
[00:14:59] was an example of he lean towards too much ego, too much confidence.
[00:15:05] So what I'm saying is, and that was part of his power, too, right?
[00:15:09] You get around someone that's super confident about things
[00:15:12] and they're like, oh no, we're gonna make this happen.
[00:15:14] And you go, yes, we are, I'm following this guy.
[00:15:16] So confidence, an ego is a positive thing.
[00:15:19] It absolutely is.
[00:15:22] Too much of it, and you can get yourself in trouble.
[00:15:24] Let's look at what happened
[00:15:26] at towards the end of the war.
[00:15:28] Pat and got relieved of command.
[00:15:30] They moved him out of commanding combat troops
[00:15:34] and they moved him into a position
[00:15:38] which was a, it was like a,
[00:15:43] what's that word?
[00:15:44] It was like a figurehead position.
[00:15:46] Okay, cool.
[00:15:47] They put him in charge of the 15th army,
[00:15:51] which sounds really cool,
[00:15:52] but they were actually just responsible
[00:15:54] for capturing the history of what was happening.
[00:15:57] So we're talking low impact job.
[00:16:01] No, and by the way, no command in the Pacific,
[00:16:05] because they were still fighting and he wanted
[00:16:06] to go to the Pacific, didn't take over any major troops.
[00:16:11] Didn't even go, didn't even go to Pacific theater.
[00:16:14] Not even in charge of like the occupation army,
[00:16:17] in Germany, not even in charge of that.
[00:16:20] So think about that.
[00:16:21] Here's this guy, and because of his tactical prowess,
[00:16:29] he did great on the battlefield,
[00:16:31] but as soon as they could,
[00:16:33] they shifted him over and put him out the pasture.
[00:16:36] Why is that?
[00:16:37] Because of his ego.
[00:16:38] So that's what bombs me out is because,
[00:16:43] if he would have just had some humility to think,
[00:16:46] how am I going to play this game a little bit better?
[00:16:49] How am I going to interact with my superiors?
[00:16:53] With my superior officers, how am I going to interact with them?
[00:16:55] He probably would have, if he absolutely,
[00:16:57] I should have probably, would he absolutely
[00:16:59] could have ended up being the Supreme Allied commander, for sure?
[00:17:05] But he didn't.
[00:17:06] So that being said, of course,
[00:17:09] there's all kinds of things we can learn from Patton.
[00:17:13] And who knows, maybe he was right.
[00:17:14] This maybe his son wasn't a very confident person.
[00:17:17] Maybe he was trying to balk balk to his son up
[00:17:20] in this particular letter.
[00:17:22] But there's a lot of things that he wrote.
[00:17:26] And I mean, there's a lot, and it's awesome to read.
[00:17:30] But last time we covered Letter of Instruction One and Two
[00:17:33] to his troops, this is again, going back towards prior
[00:17:37] to D.T.
[00:17:37] D.T.
[00:17:38] And we might as well just jump into Letter of Instruction Number Three.
[00:17:42] Now this one was very, very tactical.
[00:17:46] And by that, I mean, I should, shouldn't even say tactical,
[00:17:50] because tactics is good.
[00:17:51] Very specific talking about types of armor
[00:17:55] and what to do in very specific situations.
[00:17:59] So I'm going to take a little bit less from this letter,
[00:18:02] but there is a bunch of things in here that are relevant,
[00:18:06] are powerful, and things that anybody that's
[00:18:09] in a leadership situation can utilize.
[00:18:11] So this one's a little bit, I'm jumping around a bit.
[00:18:15] I should, since I'm jumping around,
[00:18:17] but I'm skipping more stuff in this letter,
[00:18:19] but you can find these online if you want to.
[00:18:20] So one of the things he says to begin with,
[00:18:24] haste and speed are not synonymous.
[00:18:28] By this, I mean that hasty attacks do not produce
[00:18:31] speedy successes or speedy advances,
[00:18:34] because hasty attacks are not coordinated attacks,
[00:18:37] haste makes ways.
[00:18:38] So rushing to get something done, not effective.
[00:18:41] Hey, that's what he means by haste,
[00:18:43] which is weird, because I think when I think of the word haste,
[00:18:46] and I don't want to dive into like the etymology
[00:18:48] of the word haste, but I think it has a little bit of a,
[00:18:52] now it is, I think it has a little bit of a positive
[00:18:55] connotation, right?
[00:18:56] Hey, we need to make haste, we need to move quick,
[00:18:58] like it's a good thing, but I think even just this short time
[00:19:02] ago, it's more aligned with the idea of haste makes
[00:19:07] a waste, right?
[00:19:08] Like if it's more like rushing,
[00:19:10] because rushing doesn't have a positive connotation, right?
[00:19:13] You say, hey, you need to rush, like no one says that.
[00:19:15] No one says, hey, rush with your homework to your kid.
[00:19:19] You don't say rush, no you say hurry.
[00:19:22] You need to say move faster, but you don't say,
[00:19:25] you don't say rush, because that means you're going to miss something.
[00:19:29] Yeah, almost like rush means hurry with the note
[00:19:34] that it's like in a negative way.
[00:19:36] Or in a like, and so I think this at this time here at haste
[00:19:40] had that connotation as well.
[00:19:42] So he's saying haste makes ways to continuing in an armored
[00:19:46] division as an infantry division, attacks must be coordinated
[00:19:50] and the infantry and the tanks and the guns must work as a unit.
[00:19:56] Success depends upon the coordinated use of guns and the tanks.
[00:19:59] So what does that mean?
[00:20:00] Covered move.
[00:20:01] That's what it means, work together as a team.
[00:20:04] All your different elements in your company and your team
[00:20:07] and your business need to work together.
[00:20:10] Wouldn't that seem obvious?
[00:20:13] Wouldn't it seem obvious?
[00:20:14] Yeah.
[00:20:14] It's not obvious.
[00:20:15] Well, it's obvious hard to do.
[00:20:17] People don't do it like they should.
[00:20:19] Yeah, one of the many things that seem obvious
[00:20:21] is they had or when you're not involved in it,
[00:20:23] but then you know in science.
[00:20:25] You know, that's why in leadership strategy and tactics
[00:20:27] when I was talking about what to do is a new leader.
[00:20:31] And I say like read this before you go into a meeting, read this
[00:20:35] when you go to bed at night because you can't just read it.
[00:20:37] Go, cool.
[00:20:38] Okay, I read through now.
[00:20:39] I'm good.
[00:20:40] No, you need to embed it into your brain.
[00:20:42] Read what the laws of combat.
[00:20:43] No, the section on page 158 of leadership strategy,
[00:20:47] the tactics and everything that I know that is because people
[00:20:49] people said, oh, I just answered, I go, I go to page 150
[00:20:52] and leadership strategy and tactics.
[00:20:53] But you can't just read it one time, be like, okay, no,
[00:20:55] you need to embed those things into your brain.
[00:20:58] Yeah.
[00:20:59] It's something kind of like this, right?
[00:21:01] How long does it take to embed in the brain
[00:21:02] that, oh, we need to work together?
[00:21:07] A little bit more cover and move here.
[00:21:08] When tanks are advancing, they must use their guns
[00:21:11] for what is known as recliner.
[00:21:12] Reconnaissance by fire.
[00:21:13] That is they must shoot at any terrestrial object
[00:21:17] behind which an anti tank gun might be concealed
[00:21:19] and take these targets under fire to arrange
[00:21:22] greater than the range at which an anti tank gun is effective.
[00:21:25] In other words, at a range of greater than 2,000 yards.
[00:21:28] Actually, that's not even really covered.
[00:21:30] It's kind of a little bit of cover move,
[00:21:31] but that's being proactive, right?
[00:21:33] Hey, there could be an anti tank gun over there.
[00:21:36] The anti tank gun has a range of whatever,
[00:21:39] a thousand meters at 2,000 meters.
[00:21:42] I'm hitting those targets.
[00:21:44] I'll somebody hit me up on it on Twitter
[00:21:47] and said there was a name for that type of shooting
[00:21:50] and I can't remember what it is.
[00:21:51] But it's shooting where you think the enemy might be.
[00:21:55] In tank versus tank, doles the first round
[00:21:57] should be armor piercing.
[00:22:00] If this fails, the second round must be white phosphorus
[00:22:03] and short, so as to give our tank a chance to maneuver
[00:22:07] because by keeping its gun laid on with smoke,
[00:22:11] it has a better chance of getting in the second telling shot
[00:22:14] than has the enemy who, when he emerges from the smoke,
[00:22:18] does not know the location of our vehicle,
[00:22:20] armored infantry should make a violent attack
[00:22:22] using all its men and weapons.
[00:22:23] So that's a cool one.
[00:22:24] If you fire your first shot, cool the second shot,
[00:22:29] you've got to put some smoke out so they can't see what you're doing.
[00:22:32] You should have hit him on the first shot.
[00:22:34] If you don't, you're good because you put in some smoke
[00:22:36] where you still know where he is,
[00:22:39] but he has to look through this giant smoke.
[00:22:40] And so when he, when the smoke clears,
[00:22:43] he doesn't know where you are and you're getting another round on him.
[00:22:48] We used to set up our magazines
[00:22:52] with something called a party mix.
[00:22:55] So do you have different types of rounds for your weapon?
[00:22:58] And so guys would put like armor piercing rounds,
[00:23:01] like the first couple rounds armor piercing rounds.
[00:23:04] The second couple, I think everyone to do the own thing
[00:23:06] because like the second one would be like a,
[00:23:11] a more of an anti-personel type round.
[00:23:13] That's kind of, and this is against the Geneva convention.
[00:23:16] It's not, it's not called an expanding round
[00:23:18] because it doesn't expand, but there's rounds
[00:23:19] that we have that tumble when they hit.
[00:23:21] So be some of those then, some tracers at the bottom.
[00:23:23] Like all kinds of, they can just,
[00:23:25] they set up a little party mix.
[00:23:27] Yeah, we do that with shotguns.
[00:23:28] Oh, we do, do we?
[00:23:30] We do, yeah.
[00:23:30] Look at his guy.
[00:23:32] Oh, tactical echo.
[00:23:33] Comment in how it's going to be.
[00:23:34] We're not going to be tactical.
[00:23:35] It's just anyway.
[00:23:36] Okay.
[00:23:37] Well, you know what I'm saying, right?
[00:23:39] That makes sense.
[00:23:40] All right.
[00:23:41] You understand that I understand what you're talking about.
[00:23:43] That's what I'm saying.
[00:23:44] Tactical echo coming in hot.
[00:23:46] That's what we do with shotguns.
[00:23:47] What party mix do you use, my friend?
[00:23:51] Educate, buckshot, birdshot, slug.
[00:23:54] You'll have one after the other.
[00:23:56] So they're like different.
[00:23:57] You can see how they feel, whatever.
[00:24:00] Yeah.
[00:24:01] What do you have in your home?
[00:24:03] Double.
[00:24:04] Okay.
[00:24:05] Okay.
[00:24:06] For the shotguns.
[00:24:07] Yes.
[00:24:08] Double up.
[00:24:09] That's where you're going with.
[00:24:10] That's where we're going with.
[00:24:11] Okay.
[00:24:12] Both the end two and three.
[00:24:14] The whole magazine is filled with those.
[00:24:17] Well, they're not.
[00:24:18] That's what I have.
[00:24:19] But yeah, that's what I would.
[00:24:21] Yeah.
[00:24:22] So you know what I feel the mega deep.
[00:24:22] I've got a slug.
[00:24:23] No.
[00:24:24] No.
[00:24:25] Okay.
[00:24:26] I think it's just for fun when you do the party mix.
[00:24:29] Yeah.
[00:24:30] Or it makes me, you know, my ass.
[00:24:33] There we go.
[00:24:34] Yeah.
[00:24:35] No, no, no.
[00:24:36] The party mix is not for friend act for fun echo Charles.
[00:24:37] In my experience.
[00:24:38] In my experience.
[00:24:39] There's a reason for it.
[00:24:40] I got to think through it.
[00:24:41] There's a bunch of different reasons why you could set things up a different way.
[00:24:43] Right?
[00:24:44] Yes.
[00:24:45] I would think so.
[00:24:46] You could.
[00:24:47] I understand.
[00:24:48] Check.
[00:24:49] This is welcome to the podcast.
[00:24:51] I'm so glad.
[00:24:52] This guy got a gun.
[00:24:53] And now it's out.
[00:24:54] I'm going to check.
[00:24:59] Tell, let me know.
[00:25:00] I'm staying in my ear.
[00:25:02] Tell Patten what's up.
[00:25:04] Oh, check.
[00:25:06] I probably just shut down.
[00:25:07] You ever say anything about my job.
[00:25:09] I know.
[00:25:10] I will be your channel bond with you in Patten.
[00:25:12] But we're, we're, we're, we're one.
[00:25:14] Right.
[00:25:15] It is more important to get.
[00:25:17] It is more important to get the information back fast than to get it back secretly.
[00:25:21] Therefore, use clear with a limited code for name only.
[00:25:25] This is interesting.
[00:25:26] So you have encrypted radios.
[00:25:28] You have codes that you can use.
[00:25:31] And what he's saying is like, listen, and sometimes especially now, especially in the past,
[00:25:35] that would make transmitting information a lot harder.
[00:25:39] It takes the power away from the signal.
[00:25:41] Sometimes it just takes time to encrypt the message.
[00:25:43] And what he's saying is like, listen, it's more important that we get the information
[00:25:47] back there than it is that we keep it all secret.
[00:25:50] It's just an interesting point to me because it shows the importance of fast communication
[00:25:56] of letting people know what's happening.
[00:25:58] Yeah, this is obviously something you have to be careful of.
[00:26:01] But it's an interesting point.
[00:26:04] Just the fact that you have to keep information flowing as quickly as possible.
[00:26:08] And at this time, keeping it moving fast would Trump keeping it secure.
[00:26:15] In tactical situations, because obviously there's strategic situations.
[00:26:18] I mean, we broke the German and NIGMA code.
[00:26:21] We broke the Japanese code.
[00:26:23] And that was massively important for us to win the wars.
[00:26:30] So continuing whenever German anti-tank guns have gotten our tanks, it has almost always
[00:26:38] been our own fault.
[00:26:41] Despite of years of instruction, tanks will go up obvious tank lanes, such as cart tracks,
[00:26:48] open river bottoms, small roads or path or along hedges, all of which any intelligent
[00:26:53] anti-tank gunner will have a range to cover.
[00:26:56] Isn't that brilliant?
[00:26:59] Like when you're looking at the terrain, you can go on, oh, look at this path.
[00:27:04] If we go down that path, guess what?
[00:27:05] The German gunners are expecting you to have path, and they're going to be waiting for you.
[00:27:08] It's also an interesting idea of ownership when we lose a tank.
[00:27:13] It's almost always our fault.
[00:27:17] Next, the German anti-tank gunners a good shot.
[00:27:20] We are better shots.
[00:27:21] He is unprotected.
[00:27:22] We are behind inches of steel.
[00:27:24] If we use our heads and our American ingenuity and initiative, we have nothing to fear
[00:27:30] from the German anti-tank guns.
[00:27:32] You know what's crazy?
[00:27:33] I just hit me as I'm reading this.
[00:27:38] That he's saying these things specifically because guys were scared of these German anti-tank
[00:27:44] guns.
[00:27:46] I'm just thinking about it from a tankers perspective.
[00:27:48] When you're at a tank, you're all claustrophobic, you're locked in this thing.
[00:27:52] It's this weird dichotomy.
[00:27:58] In one sense, you feel really protected, and in another sense, you feel completely vulnerable.
[00:28:03] You feel protected because all these little bullets aren't going to hurt you.
[00:28:07] Some mines aren't going to hurt you, but then at the same time, you know, one big hit, and
[00:28:12] there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:28:14] You're going to die.
[00:28:16] So that's an interesting thing.
[00:28:18] He's addressing that fault that can go through someone's head is like, okay, yeah, I feel
[00:28:24] protected, but also one hit, and I'm dead.
[00:28:27] The way that when you're armor gets pierced by an anti-tank gun, like the picture
[00:28:36] being in a tank, and there's just hot metal spraying around and they're going to kill
[00:28:41] you.
[00:28:42] Like it's an awful thing to picture.
[00:28:44] Is it hard, like, okay, when you're in the tank, it's kind of claustrophobic.
[00:28:48] Is it, is it hard to get in and out of this?
[00:28:50] Like it takes a little while, especially if you get hit with a mind, and you know,
[00:28:57] you these big giant steel doors, imagine how hard it is when that thing gets bent a little
[00:29:02] bit.
[00:29:03] You're not getting out.
[00:29:07] Oh man, you're going to panic in there.
[00:29:09] Well, I'm going to panic in there.
[00:29:10] Yeah, or even like if you, and not that this would happen all the time or whatever, I don't
[00:29:12] know, but like if you just tips over or something, and it's like, oh, we got to get out
[00:29:17] of here and you're like, kind of stock.
[00:29:19] Yeah, it's horrible.
[00:29:20] Yeah.
[00:29:21] But at the same time, it's like, it is protected.
[00:29:24] Like, that's what he's dealing with here.
[00:29:26] Yeah.
[00:29:27] That's what he's talking about here.
[00:29:28] And it's the same thing, you know, with these big IEDs that the enemy makes where you
[00:29:33] think, hey, I'm protected.
[00:29:35] I'm going to tank, but one of those big giant IEDs can do some damage.
[00:29:43] Next armored battles against infantry and anti tanks are short and violent.
[00:29:48] They take great strength in mind, and both physical and moral courage, because of this
[00:29:54] violence and the speed with which they are terminated.
[00:29:58] And once launched tanks must closed at their best speed, just the same as infantry, and also
[00:30:05] just the same as infantry, they must fire while closing.
[00:30:14] Next, every effort must be made to attack the flank, or preferably the rear of the enemy.
[00:30:23] In executing such an attack, we must use all means that our command to prevent the enemy
[00:30:27] from stopping these turning movements.
[00:30:29] So this is exactly what I was talking about.
[00:30:35] Think about this, every effort must be made to attack the flank, or preferably the rear
[00:30:39] of the enemy.
[00:30:40] That's brilliant.
[00:30:41] I talked about this all the time.
[00:30:43] You don't want to attack your enemy head on, you want to attack them from the flank, right?
[00:30:49] Clearly he understood that.
[00:30:51] However, you can look at his history, and he would attack his superiors, his people
[00:30:59] are out, you know, the people's peers, he would attack them instead of developing a relationship
[00:31:04] instead of coming from the flank, and it ended up putting him in a position where he
[00:31:08] didn't get the final command that he wanted to get.
[00:31:13] So yes, my goal is to think about patting from a tactical perspective and then take it
[00:31:24] one step further and apply his battlefield tactics to leadership.
[00:31:30] And I wish he would have done that.
[00:31:38] Here he says to summarize, and here's where he kind of r- I skipped a bunch of stuff, but
[00:31:42] to summarize, we must take great and calculated risks in the use of armor, but we must
[00:31:46] not dive off the deep end without first determining whether this running pole is full of water.
[00:31:53] That's the dichotomy of leadership.
[00:31:54] Yes, you have to take risk, but no, you don't just jump in.
[00:31:59] This is a good one.
[00:32:00] You must never halt because some other unit is stuck.
[00:32:04] If you push on, you will release the pressure on the adjacent unit, and it will accompany
[00:32:09] you.
[00:32:10] That is really smart.
[00:32:13] Someone next to you gets bogged down and you stop to help them.
[00:32:18] And now you're going to get bogged down until.
[00:32:20] So don't do that.
[00:32:23] This was Dean Ladd going into Taurua.
[00:32:29] And the order was for all the Marines, if someone gets hit, keep going.
[00:32:34] That's what we need to do.
[00:32:36] And thankfully, for Dean Ladd, his men didn't obey that order, but if everyone didn't obey
[00:32:42] that order on that day, they never would have made it to the beach.
[00:32:47] So that's not just a one-on-one.
[00:32:49] That's the same with units as well.
[00:32:54] Next troops are never defeated by casualties, but by lack of resolution of guts.
[00:33:03] Girls are won by a few brave men who refuse to fear and push on.
[00:33:12] It should be our ambition, our ambition to be members of this heroic group.
[00:33:18] So you're never going to lose a battle because of casualties, you're going to lose because
[00:33:21] of lack of resolution of guts.
[00:33:25] More casualties occur among those who halt or go to the rear than among those who advance
[00:33:31] and advance firing.
[00:33:32] That's default aggressive.
[00:33:34] We're not going to run back.
[00:33:35] We're not going to stop.
[00:33:36] We're going to be default aggressive and keep maneuvering.
[00:33:39] Finally, all of us must have a desperate desire and determination to close with the enemy
[00:33:46] and to destroy them.
[00:33:49] Desperate desire.
[00:33:50] I kind of just breeze through those words, but think about what those words mean.
[00:33:54] A desperate desire and determination to close with the enemy and destroy them.
[00:34:00] Boom.
[00:34:04] He's got a little section here called common tactical faults.
[00:34:10] It is nearly always a mistake to occupy obvious cover.
[00:34:14] This is particularly true in sparsely wooded country because the woods are clearly marked
[00:34:19] on maps and in the enemy possession and they will almost invariably be subject of concentration.
[00:34:27] You each to see this run out of training, we put guys out on reconnaissance and they're
[00:34:31] doing a reconnaissance of some target.
[00:34:35] If there was you look up at like a hillside and there's like one little group of shrubs,
[00:34:43] you can take your opposing force guys and go, hey, go check out those shrubs and there's
[00:34:48] like a 60% chance.
[00:34:51] There's the little seal squad or little seal fire team sitting in there with a camera.
[00:34:56] You just walk up there and see, big surprise.
[00:35:01] There was three outcroppings of brush and you're in one of them, what a surprise.
[00:35:07] So that's what he's saying here.
[00:35:10] Don't take the obvious cover.
[00:35:14] When the fire starts, bayonets should be fixed.
[00:35:17] They encourage our soldiers and discurs the enemy.
[00:35:21] In a platoon or any other commander moves to the front to reconnoiter during a firefight,
[00:35:28] he must not move to the rear to disseminate information he is acquired, but rather the
[00:35:33] unit must come up to him.
[00:35:36] The site of officers moving to the rear has a disturbing effect on the troops and serves
[00:35:39] no useful purpose.
[00:35:40] That's a brilliant little thing to think about.
[00:35:43] Hey, I'm going to go up and find out what's going on in 40 minutes, send someone to
[00:35:48] this location and I'll tell you what's going on.
[00:35:51] Next, and again, skipping a bunch, but these are the key points.
[00:36:00] There is a ridiculous and widespread fear among all our troops that they will run out of
[00:36:05] ammunition, particularly small arms ammunition.
[00:36:08] If my, in my experience, this has never happened.
[00:36:12] Troops should remember that if they save ammunition, which they could have effectively
[00:36:16] suspended against the enemy for some unforeseen contingency, they will also save the lives
[00:36:21] of a number of enemy who will participate in the contingency.
[00:36:27] So he's saying, get some.
[00:36:29] I can tell you that guys in Ramadi ran out of ammunition, even though he may not have experienced
[00:36:36] it happened.
[00:36:37] It happens.
[00:36:40] That little story I've told before about Mikey Montsour making this video.
[00:36:46] Yeah.
[00:36:47] And me showing up and everyone's saying, go watch Mikey's video.
[00:36:49] And I'm like, cool, I go watch Mikey's video and then Tim going in the moon.
[00:36:54] And he shows it to me and of course, on Mr. serious.
[00:37:00] And I say, Mikey, there's a firefake going on.
[00:37:03] What are you doing taking a video?
[00:37:05] And he's like, I was like, just a surfer.
[00:37:08] I was like, cool, you're not at home.
[00:37:11] Guess, guess, makes a video.
[00:37:13] But yes, you can't run out of ammunition.
[00:37:16] So maybe not 100% really with that on that one.
[00:37:21] The necessity for using all weapons to their maximum fire capacity during our attacks cannot
[00:37:27] be too strongly impressed on the soldiers.
[00:37:30] And he gun that is not firing is not doing its job.
[00:37:32] And the assault we're marching fires used by infantry every gun machine gun and mortar must
[00:37:38] fire.
[00:37:39] So yeah, I mean, that's what he's talking about.
[00:37:42] I think even to the previous point, he's talking about these assaults where you have
[00:37:48] a massive logistics train right behind you.
[00:37:50] So you're not, you should really shouldn't run out of ammunition.
[00:37:54] Unlike what we were doing where you might not have logistics train right there behind
[00:37:59] you, you might have to be kind of stuck out the city somewhere for a little while.
[00:38:04] So yeah, get some with the guns.
[00:38:07] At the close of a fight is very desirable that our own dead be removed from view is rapidly
[00:38:12] as possible.
[00:38:13] After this has been accomplished, the enemy dead should be removed with the same reverence
[00:38:17] we accord our own and given a proper burial.
[00:38:22] Next there is a regrettable tendency on the part of company officers and non-commission
[00:38:27] officers to accompany the firing line as if they were members on a well-trained chorus
[00:38:33] simply keeping position.
[00:38:36] This attitude of mind and the actions resulting from it is impossible in battle.
[00:38:41] Officers and non-commission officers are there for the purpose of seeing that all the weapons
[00:38:46] of their respective little commands are functioning.
[00:38:49] They cannot see this by simply accompanying the movement.
[00:38:53] They must direct it.
[00:38:56] This is the thing about this that I think of and I've talked about this before with
[00:39:06] Stoner Seth Stone who was the Delta Patum Commander in Task and Abuser and him want
[00:39:12] to him staying exactly where he was supposed to stay according to the standard operating
[00:39:17] procedures while executing maneuvers on the battlefield.
[00:39:22] There's a pre-determined place where everyone is supposed to be.
[00:39:27] I was watching him, he'd be in the perfect pre-determined place but the pre-determined place
[00:39:31] that you're in doesn't always allow you to see what you need to see as the leader.
[00:39:35] You actually just because that's the standard operating procedure, there are deviations
[00:39:41] that you can make and that you need to make as the leader to make sure that you can see
[00:39:44] what's going on, you can see with the next maneuver's supposed to be.
[00:39:48] That's sort of what he's talking about here.
[00:39:51] What he's saying is you aren't just going along with the movement.
[00:39:53] You gotta make it happen to the same thing I was saying Stoner like, hey, once the call
[00:39:56] gets made, it's not just they're going to execute it, you got to direct it, you got
[00:39:59] to get a control of it and make it go to the right place.
[00:40:05] Then he says this key point in this letter as in those proceeding it, I am not laying
[00:40:14] down inflexible rules, I am simply giving you my ideas.
[00:40:21] Even this guy who thinks that he's so smart and thinks that all of his military intuitions
[00:40:25] are 100% correct and will be proven out in history to be the right call.
[00:40:32] Even this guy is saying, listen, I'm not laying down like things that you can't adapt
[00:40:37] from, I'm just giving you what my ideas are.
[00:40:40] Then he says, I must and do trust your military experience, courage and loyalty to make
[00:40:45] these ideas tangible.
[00:40:48] There are many ways of fighting, all of which are good if they are successful.
[00:40:53] So even the great, what's that word, bump to us?
[00:40:57] Yes.
[00:40:58] General Patton is saying, I know I told you like, I'm right all the time, but do what
[00:41:03] you gotta do.
[00:41:05] These aren't inflexible rules, do what you gotta do.
[00:41:09] He wraps this one up.
[00:41:12] We are now entering the final stage of a great war of a great victory.
[00:41:16] This victory can be obtained by the maximum use of all weapons, both physical and spiritual.
[00:41:25] It is the duty of all commanders to see that they're mannerfully aware of the many
[00:41:29] vile deeds perpetrated upon civilisation by the Germans and that they attack with the utmost
[00:41:36] determined, determination, ferocity and hate.
[00:41:42] I am sure that every man will do his duty and I am there for sure that victory is simply
[00:41:47] a question of when we find the enemy.
[00:41:50] So it's interesting that he's actually telling them, you need to attack with hate.
[00:41:54] It's a different level.
[00:41:56] This is total war.
[00:41:58] This isn't like, oh well, you know, attack with some dislike.
[00:42:03] No.
[00:42:04] We're going to attack with hate.
[00:42:07] And that's how he wraps up.
[00:42:08] That was a letter of instruction number three.
[00:42:10] This is letter of instruction number four.
[00:42:13] Now they're starting to make some adjustments.
[00:42:17] He says the acute supply situation confronting us has caused the Supreme Commander to
[00:42:21] direct that until further orders the third army with its supporting troops and those elements
[00:42:26] of the 9th army placed in the line will assume the defensive.
[00:42:33] Which he knows he doesn't really like very much being on defensive.
[00:42:36] It is evident that the successful accomplishment of this mission will require particular
[00:42:40] concentration upon two points.
[00:42:42] First, this change in attitude on our part must be completely concealed from the enemy who
[00:42:48] should he learn of it would certainly move troops to our front and oppose other allied
[00:42:53] armies.
[00:42:54] So he's saying, look, we can't let them know that we're going on the defensive because
[00:42:57] then they'll just, you know, back off and go attack somewhere else.
[00:43:02] And he says second, we must be in possession of a suitable line of departure so that we
[00:43:06] can move rapidly when the Supreme Commander directs us to resume the offensive.
[00:43:11] And then he says in order to carry out the requirements of paragraph 2A, which is the one
[00:43:16] I just read, we will not dig in.
[00:43:19] Wire or mine, but we will utilize a thin outpost zone back that suitable places by a powerful
[00:43:26] mobile reserves.
[00:43:27] We will further ensure that all possible avenues of tank attack are registered in all of
[00:43:32] our batteries whose guns can bear counterattacks by our mobile reserves should be planned
[00:43:39] and executed to secure a double development of the hostile effort with the purpose of not
[00:43:43] only defeating it, but destroying it.
[00:43:46] So that's pretty what he's saying is it's kind of the same strategy that the Russians
[00:43:53] take when people attack Russia, which is look, we got a little line of defense when we
[00:43:58] get attacked, we're going to back in a little bit, back off a little bit, and then back
[00:44:02] off a little bit more, and then they attack it and back off a little bit more.
[00:44:05] And then when the time is right, we'll surround them and destroy them all.
[00:44:08] That's what he's saying.
[00:44:09] But he's saying look, that's why we don't have to dig in.
[00:44:11] We're putting a thin line of defense out there and then we're going to attack, we'll just
[00:44:15] back up.
[00:44:16] We got strong defense further back, but we're just going to back up, we're going to lower
[00:44:20] the enemy in and then we're going to envelop them.
[00:44:26] Very.
[00:44:27] Simple.
[00:44:28] The other thing that's good about it is when you're not dug in as soon as you get
[00:44:33] the order to attack, boom, we're going on the attack because we're not dug in, which
[00:44:37] is again something I talked about, leaders from strategy and tactics, which I wish, the
[00:44:43] patent would have read my chapter.
[00:44:45] Sorry.
[00:44:47] Speaking of ego, there you go, revealed.
[00:44:52] I wish Paton read my chapter about don't dig in because how often did Paton think, hey,
[00:44:59] this is how we should do something and when he didn't, when he got told another way instead
[00:45:03] of saying, okay, I understand, okay, we'll go for it.
[00:45:07] It was resistance.
[00:45:08] It was okay, we'll do it.
[00:45:09] But he didn't like it.
[00:45:11] I need to let that be known.
[00:45:14] Which again, look, I get it.
[00:45:17] Oh, I'm not going to do it.
[00:45:18] Somebody tells me to do if I don't agree with it.
[00:45:20] No, I'm not saying that.
[00:45:22] And there's time, we've doesn't make any sense whatsoever cool.
[00:45:25] You know, then maybe there is a time we draw a line in the sand.
[00:45:28] But these were big giant operations where it's like, okay, we do it like this.
[00:45:32] We do it like that.
[00:45:33] No, we should do it my way.
[00:45:35] And so much resistance.
[00:45:37] And you're going to end up doing it anyways, by the way, that he just didn't develop
[00:45:41] the kind of relationship that he needed and he didn't gain the kind of trust that he needed
[00:45:45] up the chain of command where they put him in, to see in your positions where he could
[00:45:48] have had even more impact.
[00:45:49] Oh, yeah, don't dig in.
[00:45:53] Don't dig in around your ideas.
[00:45:56] Don't dig in even on the defense sometimes.
[00:46:00] Which I hesitate to say, let me just make this note.
[00:46:06] If you're in a truly defensive position, dig in because the enemy is going to attack you
[00:46:11] and you don't want to be, you want to have a place that you can get good covered from the enemy
[00:46:16] attack.
[00:46:17] I'm not saying never dig in.
[00:46:20] I'm saying most of the time don't dig in.
[00:46:23] All right, now this next section is from something that Pat wrote.
[00:46:30] I want to say you wrote it in 1924, 26, something like that.
[00:46:36] But we've been way before World War II.
[00:46:39] But it was after he got done with World War I.
[00:46:43] And once again, not reading the whole thing.
[00:46:45] But I think the name of this essay, we'll call it by General Patton, was the secret of
[00:46:53] victory.
[00:46:58] And this is where you kind of start to realize that Patton was a really smart and educated
[00:47:04] individual because he's a very eloquent writer, especially for a guy that swore so much.
[00:47:10] But very eloquent writer, and we'll go to this here, despite the years of fought and
[00:47:20] oceans of ink which have been devoted to the elicidation of war, its secrets still remain
[00:47:31] shrouded in mystery.
[00:47:34] Indeed, it is due largely to the very volume of available information that the veil is so
[00:47:41] thick.
[00:47:42] So everyone's been trying to figure out war for a long time.
[00:47:46] And because so many people have written about it, that's what makes it hard, it's one
[00:47:49] of the things that makes it hard to understand is that so much stuff has been written about
[00:47:52] it.
[00:47:54] And by the way, that whole opening letter to George, like we could have just broken that entire
[00:47:59] thing down.
[00:48:00] Maybe we should have.
[00:48:01] He's talking about you need to read history.
[00:48:05] So he goes on here.
[00:48:08] War isn't art and as such is not susceptible of explanation by fixed formulae.
[00:48:16] So wars, this crazy thing, and it's, you can't just say, okay, this is what war is.
[00:48:21] No, it's an art.
[00:48:22] It's like trying to explain art.
[00:48:25] Can you explain art?
[00:48:26] Can you explain why someone likes this painting, but not that painting, but the other person
[00:48:29] likes that painting, but not this painting, you can't explain that.
[00:48:32] You can't explain why you universally, most people like this painting.
[00:48:36] You universally, most people like this song, right?
[00:48:38] You can't explain that.
[00:48:40] Otherwise guess what, people would just go, oh, go, I need to make a hit and song.
[00:48:43] No, I'll just produce one.
[00:48:44] The formulae formulae.
[00:48:47] No one can describe what makes a good video because the echo charts you're here.
[00:48:53] Sure.
[00:48:54] Now, this is something you are cleared hot to talk about, right?
[00:48:56] Okay.
[00:48:57] A little bit more than weapons load out.
[00:48:59] Probably.
[00:49:00] So, if it was, hey, we just need to make a good video and it'll go viral.
[00:49:06] That's the answer.
[00:49:07] Right, cool.
[00:49:08] Hey, echo, go make a viral video.
[00:49:09] Do it with your favorite.
[00:49:10] Just go make a viral video.
[00:49:11] You can't do it.
[00:49:12] You can't do it.
[00:49:13] Yeah, actually, that's a good comparison because there's so, and especially now, and probably
[00:49:17] more in the future, where there's going to be a lot of information, or a lot of people
[00:49:21] start writing about it, or write more about it about what makes a viral video.
[00:49:26] That's like perfect.
[00:49:27] Yeah, it's a more perfect thing because everybody wants to make a viral video.
[00:49:31] Oh, yeah.
[00:49:32] That's the, I mean, everybody wants to make a viral video, but you can't just open up
[00:49:36] the formula and say, okay, cool.
[00:49:38] What we need to do is need to be 38 seconds long and you have this type of soundtrack
[00:49:42] and you have this type of visuals and this type of voice over.
[00:49:45] Good.
[00:49:46] Okay, produce it.
[00:49:47] Boom.
[00:49:48] Do it.
[00:49:49] Gangman style.
[00:49:50] Oh, whatever that one.
[00:49:51] And got your style.
[00:49:53] How did that end up being one of the most, it might be the most.
[00:49:56] It might be the most viewed video of all time, right?
[00:49:59] I don't know.
[00:50:00] But it's up there.
[00:50:01] We know that.
[00:50:02] I know for at least three months of time, my little kids between the ages of whatever they were,
[00:50:07] six and eight were walking around the house, singing Gangnam style.
[00:50:12] Yes, there.
[00:50:13] Yeah.
[00:50:14] And I'm saying, haven't, wait, hold on.
[00:50:16] Let me play Blacks' App is for you, please.
[00:50:18] Yeah.
[00:50:19] Yeah.
[00:50:20] And even when people do do to make the formula, it's like super ambiguous.
[00:50:25] And guess what?
[00:50:26] That same guy?
[00:50:27] There.
[00:50:28] Okay.
[00:50:29] Well, we've made Gangnam style.
[00:50:31] Just making another one.
[00:50:32] Yeah.
[00:50:33] No.
[00:50:34] I don't even think there was another one.
[00:50:35] Yeah.
[00:50:36] Yeah.
[00:50:37] There.
[00:50:37] I mean, that's like a group, right?
[00:50:38] I think that's like a music group.
[00:50:40] See, we don't even know.
[00:50:41] Yeah.
[00:50:42] Yeah.
[00:50:43] That's the kind of point of view.
[00:50:44] No, it's like guy.
[00:50:45] Yeah.
[00:50:46] But he's like, yeah.
[00:50:47] Yeah.
[00:50:48] Artists.
[00:50:49] He's like, you as a legit, like, pop guy.
[00:50:52] Yeah.
[00:50:53] Yeah.
[00:50:54] He made that song.
[00:50:55] But then he tried to make another one.
[00:50:58] And it wasn't, you know, you just can't.
[00:51:00] He didn't.
[00:51:01] There's no form.
[00:51:02] Yeah.
[00:51:03] Same thing with war.
[00:51:04] And here we go back to the book, away from Gangnam style.
[00:51:06] We're going back to the book.
[00:51:08] Yeah.
[00:51:09] From the earliest time, there has been an unending effort to subject its complex and emotional
[00:51:16] structure to dissection, to an unseated rules for its waging, to make tangible its
[00:51:24] indangibility.
[00:51:25] One might as well strive to isolate the soul by the dissection of the cadaver as to seek
[00:51:31] the essence of war by the analysis of its records.
[00:51:36] That's a pretty powerful, right?
[00:51:38] You might as well in order to find out what makes war war, you, it's like looking for
[00:51:43] the soul in a body.
[00:51:46] And then he says, yeah, despite the impossibility of physically detecting the soul, its
[00:51:51] existence is proven by its tangible reflection in acts and thoughts.
[00:51:56] So we know we exist.
[00:51:59] It's there, but you can't open up the body and find it.
[00:52:04] So with war beyond its physical aspect of armed hosts, their hovers and impalpable something
[00:52:13] which on occasion so dominates the material as to induce victory under circumstances quite
[00:52:21] inexplicable.
[00:52:23] So sometimes things happen in war that victory is achieved and no one can really even
[00:52:29] understand how it's inexplicable.
[00:52:36] He goes on the great warriors were too busy and often too inept to write contemporaneously
[00:52:43] of their exploits, saving the form of propagates, propagand reports, while what they later
[00:52:49] put on paper as biographies were retro specs colored by their vein strivings for enhanced
[00:52:57] fame or political conditions then confronting them.
[00:53:00] So when these great warriors wrote, it was afterwards because they have time to do it
[00:53:05] while they're fighting.
[00:53:06] So afterwards and then they kind of got a little ego involved which here's, here's got general
[00:53:11] pat and call them everyone out on their ego.
[00:53:14] Or there's some political situation going on that's why they wrote it a certain way.
[00:53:18] So you don't even get the truth from the warriors themselves because they don't have
[00:53:21] time and or they do it afterwards in which case it's colored or should say miscullored
[00:53:27] by their ego or the political environment that they're at.
[00:53:32] With the efforts of historians, the case is even worse.
[00:53:36] Those who write at the time are guilty of partisanship and the urge of hero worship.
[00:53:41] So even some of that's a historian right now they got those problems.
[00:53:45] In peace the scholar flourishes and war the soldier dies.
[00:53:50] So it comes about that we view our soldiers through the eyes of scholars and attribute
[00:53:56] to them scholarly virtues.
[00:54:01] So since it's the scholarly people telling it, they paint these people to be you know
[00:54:05] scholarly and that's not always the case.
[00:54:10] Seeking obvious reasons for the obscure we analyze their conduct as told by historians
[00:54:15] and assign as reasons for their success.
[00:54:18] A parent trivial things.
[00:54:20] So we say look we we look at someone in the past who is a great warrior or a great leader
[00:54:24] and we say okay they were a great leader because of this or because of that because that's
[00:54:27] what some scholarly person wrote about.
[00:54:29] Some of you'll things music has a myriad music has its myriad of musicians but only
[00:54:40] it's dozen masters.
[00:54:43] So with painting sculpture literature medicine or trade or videos.
[00:54:51] Many are called but few are chosen.
[00:54:54] So that's what he's saying is that these leaders are the same way.
[00:54:57] There's there's there's people that make music but these combat leaders there's not too
[00:55:04] many of them that actually rate you know Beethoven or Tony Ayomi.
[00:55:15] Nor can we concur wholly with the alluring stories in the advertising sections of our
[00:55:19] magazine which ported point to the golden path of success to all and sundry who follow
[00:55:25] that particular phase of home education that they happen to advocate.
[00:55:31] So just like the get rich quicks game is not going to work these little thinking that these
[00:55:36] little leadership things that you learn okay they're not really going to help you as much.
[00:55:43] Knowledge is power but to a degree only.
[00:55:47] Its possession per se will raise a man to mediocrity but not to distinction.
[00:55:53] So you can be smart you can learn a lot but that doesn't mean it.
[00:55:55] Doesn't get you there.
[00:55:57] In art and the funny thing as you read this there's a whole this whole thing is a bug
[00:56:04] and egotistical writing right because he said listen there's normal people and then
[00:56:10] there's there's you can have knowledge that'll get you so far but to truly be the
[00:56:14] master is pretty rare.
[00:56:17] And it's he implying that he is.
[00:56:19] You get that implication a little bit in our opinion indeed the instruction obtained from
[00:56:24] such courses is of less moment to future success than his ambition which prompted the study.
[00:56:31] That's interesting right so if you're a person that says hey I want to be a leader
[00:56:34] I'm going to reach out and start trying to learn how to lead.
[00:56:37] Is that ambition that's going to make you a leader or I want to make a lot of money so
[00:56:40] I'm going to do this thing and that's going to make me a more money it's the ambition
[00:56:44] is more important in making you actually successful than the course that you bought.
[00:56:50] Hmm interesting.
[00:56:54] In considering these matters, sight should not be lost of the fact that while there is
[00:56:58] much similarity there's also a vast difference between the successful soldier and the successful
[00:57:02] man in other professions success due to knowledge and personality is the measure of ability
[00:57:07] in each case.
[00:57:09] But to all accept the soldier it has vital significance only to the individual and to a limited
[00:57:17] number of his family and associates.
[00:57:19] So success is important when you look at any other profession it's important to be successful
[00:57:25] because they person can take care of his associates and his family right.
[00:57:28] So that's very important to be successful for your family and for your associates and
[00:57:32] then he continues on while the soldier while with the soldier success or failure means infinitely
[00:57:39] more as it must of necessity be measured not in terms of personal honor or affluence but
[00:57:46] in the life happiness and honor of his men and his country.
[00:57:56] Way heavier right and then let's face it you know that's kind of we hold military people
[00:58:03] in high regards even though I mean you can find out you can go look you know what the
[00:58:08] Admiral of the Navy makes the chief of naval operation makes you can go look it up he's
[00:58:13] making whatever he's making like 113 thousand dollars a year you know what I mean and he's
[00:58:19] in charge of billions of dollars worth of equipment whereas somebody that's in charge
[00:58:24] of a medium size company is making probably 10 or 15 or 20 or even 100 times that's
[00:58:31] probably 100 times more than what the chief of naval operation makes but we hold him
[00:58:36] in high regard why because this guy isn't just protecting or taking care of you know
[00:58:42] a company he's taken care of his troops and he's taking care of the country so that's
[00:58:48] why being a military leader is held in high esteem right fully so you're not just
[00:58:58] judging someone based on their amount of money that they make continue on hence the
[00:59:04] search for that elusive secret of military success soul genius personality call it what
[00:59:12] you will is a vital interest to all of us beyond question personal knowledge is a fine thing
[00:59:20] but unfortunately it is too intimate when for example we recall a rail roll that railroad
[00:59:27] accident the picture that most vividly presents itself to us is the severed blue gray
[00:59:33] hand of some child victim not the misred signals which precipitated the tragedy so with
[00:59:44] war experiences the choking gas that strangled us sticks in our memory to the more
[00:59:49] less complete exclusion of the important fact that it was the roads and the
[00:59:53] consequent abundant mechanical transportation peculiar to the western Europe
[00:59:58] which permitted the accumulation of enough gas shells to do the strangling so we get
[01:00:04] caught up looking at this one small outcome of the problem but we don't look at it
[01:00:10] from a strategic view we don't see the big picture he says a British writer has
[01:00:19] said the characteristic of war and by the way I'm not reading this whole thing I'm
[01:00:23] jumping through parts of it so there might be might sound a little bit disjoined
[01:00:29] but it's not is disjoined when you're actually reading it he continues in
[01:00:32] another little part here a British writer has said the characteristic of war is
[01:00:38] its constant change of characteristic but as is ever the case with a morphism his
[01:00:47] remark needs explanation and here's his explanation there is an incest and
[01:00:54] constant change of means to attain the inevitable end but we must take care not
[01:01:00] to let these inevitably sundry means past are predicted attain undue
[01:01:04] eminence in the perspective of our minds so what is he saying there he's saying
[01:01:08] you got you got these things that change about how we're gonna achieve some goal
[01:01:14] and those things you can get caught up in those things they can attain undue
[01:01:21] eminence so you can believe that they're more important and then he says
[01:01:25] since the beginning there has been an unending cycle of them and for each it's
[01:01:32] advocates have claimed adoption as the soul means of successful war so all the
[01:01:36] time new war this is the most important thing this is the most important thing
[01:01:39] this is the most important thing and then he says yet the records of all time
[01:01:43] show that the unchanging ends have been or and probably ever shall be the
[01:01:48] securing of predominant force of the right sort at the right place at the
[01:01:54] right time that's the most important thing you get the strongest force at the
[01:01:58] right place at the right time that's how you win all these other things that
[01:02:00] we're talking about they they're they're they're fake and again this is a
[01:02:04] court in the pattern we could argue about those I'm telling you what he's saying
[01:02:07] is that the most important thing is to be that have the strongest force at the
[01:02:12] right place at the right time it's hard argue with that yeah continuing on
[01:02:22] in this scholarly avocation soldiers of all important nations use at the
[01:02:29] present time what purports to be the best mode of instruction the the
[01:02:33] applicatory method the characteristics of some concrete problem are first
[01:02:40] studied in the abstract and then tested by applying them with the assumed
[01:02:45] forces and situations in in solving a nagleous problems either on the terrain
[01:02:53] or a map representation of it so what he's saying there is the normal mode of
[01:03:00] instructions you look at a map you look at where you're gonna maneuver your
[01:03:02] forces and then you figure out how you're going to apply your forces and you play
[01:03:06] a little game of chess on a map or on a terrain model or even walking the
[01:03:12] terrain actually physically doing it and then he says this so that makes sense
[01:03:16] right we understand that you're gonna look at this you know how to see how
[01:03:18] you're gonna maneuver your pieces this method not only familiarizes the
[01:03:23] student with all of the tools and technicalities of his trade but also develops
[01:03:27] the aptitude for reaching decisions and the self assurance derived from
[01:03:31] demonstrated achievement okay cool so by doing that by looking at a map by
[01:03:37] looking at terrain by going out and walking through the terrain by going out
[01:03:40] and simulating combat you're gonna increase your what does he say you're self
[01:03:43] assurance your aptitude for reaching decisions that's gonna happen it's gonna
[01:03:46] make you better but then he says but at always as always there is a fly in the
[01:03:52] ointment high academic performance demands infinite intimate knowledge of details
[01:04:01] and the qualities requisite to such attainments often inhabit bodies lacking
[01:04:07] personality man that's a crazy thing to think about right that you got this
[01:04:15] people that are willing to study and willing to work but what they miss is they
[01:04:20] don't have they they they don't have the personality they don't have the
[01:04:25] charisma so they're smart the book smart right that's the term to get to use
[01:04:28] this person here and that's a thing that comes out as a negative right someone
[01:04:34] says oh you know he's a really book smart they don't say that like oh he's super
[01:04:37] book smart no that's who he's talking about people that are book smart and then
[01:04:44] he says and also the striving for such knowledge often engenders the
[01:04:50] felacious notion that capacity depends on the power to acquire such details
[01:04:55] not the ability to apply them so you got someone over here that can memorize
[01:04:59] what's in the book but that doesn't necessarily mean that they can take
[01:05:02] what's in the book and apply it you notice that you did see right you get
[01:05:08] someone that understands the move yeah but you got to know how to well look
[01:05:14] jjitsu is an interesting example because you can take someone and teach them the
[01:05:18] move and you're gonna get it and they can achieve a good level but the people
[01:05:21] that can go next level are the people that can take those things and apply them
[01:05:24] in different ways different situations different scenarios and then create
[01:05:29] things out of it that's the difference between or not even but up this is I
[01:05:34] think someone can be just a good applyer and be a world champion in jjitsu
[01:05:39] like someone that studies and is great and knows the moves they can be a world
[01:05:43] champion but to be like the elite of the elite you got to have that next
[01:05:50] level you got to be able to take those things and apply create next level yeah
[01:05:54] and not to skew the thing towards making videos or nothing like that that seems
[01:05:59] to be the top and well you know but you see the end with a lot of stuff like
[01:06:03] where do you see this with weapons as well sorry you're out of the
[01:06:10] right when you know like sometimes and then you okay you saw you run to this on
[01:06:16] YouTube where it's like okay you can look you can look up videos on how to make
[01:06:19] videos right so and then so after a while you can kind of discern okay this
[01:06:24] person just read the directions you know you know how you get that impression
[01:06:27] from somebody and it doesn't matter you know necessarily video it can be a
[01:06:31] lot of stuff when it's like you just get the impression that they read the
[01:06:34] directions and they did a good that it clean perfect but you can sort of tell
[01:06:38] versus the guy who's like maybe a little bit more creative with it or yep you
[01:06:42] can you can tell they understand the cool comprehensive thing and then they
[01:06:45] can add their own personal little element well the example that I use which I've
[01:06:49] used before is you can take a flyer and put it up in a good-tarr center and
[01:06:54] say hey I need someone that can play you can pick the most complicated songs
[01:06:59] ever and there's you'll get 20 people that will call you up and they'll
[01:07:02] actually be able to play those songs and yet they're all working regular
[01:07:06] jobs because they didn't have that thing that creative thing they learned the
[01:07:11] mechanics of the job but they couldn't they can't create something new no
[01:07:16] offense I mean I wish I could play guitar like that I can't but that's what
[01:07:22] separates that's why that's why there's people that can are incredible musicians
[01:07:28] guitarist technicians maybe musicians as a sort of just musicians imply that
[01:07:33] they got that creative spark too I don't know that mean to me yeah I don't
[01:07:39] know yeah maybe okay well you can put you out there yes or no I guess you've got
[01:07:43] incredible technical musicians that can play any song on whatever instrument
[01:07:49] but they don't have that little thing and that's what he's talking about their
[01:07:54] book smart yeah what about you know you get these okay you know the old school art
[01:07:59] right that real valuable art like you know Picasso and others then you have these
[01:08:04] master foragers where are they on this whole thing
[01:08:08] maybe like I mean I think they're like the technical guitarist that can
[01:08:16] lay down the riff exactly you can't tell the difference but it doesn't really
[01:08:20] matter because they can't create something new right if you're a master forger
[01:08:23] that's great but you you're not going to be remembered because you didn't
[01:08:27] create anything so creativity is what we're talking about here which again you know when
[01:08:33] we went over the the Marine Corps manual tactics with Dave Burke like think about how
[01:08:37] often they talked about creativity good to take yes good deal day think about how often
[01:08:42] they talked about creativity yeah and I've been talking about since day one I think it was on
[01:08:46] the first time I was on Tim Ferriss I said combat is an exercising creativity and it is and
[01:08:51] that's what he's saying yeah for the master forger essentially will always have that
[01:08:58] limitation no matter how good no matter you unless he can break out right and you know
[01:09:04] what I thought you were going with this was like the modern art you know where it's just
[01:09:09] some random thing and and you can look at it go well my four-year-old could have created that
[01:09:13] right yes and then there's other people going away this second you're messing something here
[01:09:17] that this is why this is creative this is why this is important whatever and what's interesting
[01:09:22] also is when people when you when you when you're that good of an artist at drawing things
[01:09:30] you have to get that good at drawing things realistically before you can break out and see them
[01:09:34] from a different perspective I think I'm not a presenter yeah I don't know but don't I mean
[01:09:39] not to say that that's not true but it's one of the things that Karri you're saying earlier there is no
[01:09:42] formulae there even in evaluation of art really I mean we're all trained to understand
[01:09:49] this is a well-known critic of art but is there even such thing as a critic of art officially
[01:09:55] yeah not really no and it's it's weird too because like with music there's music that is so
[01:10:02] popular that I can't stand and most of the music that I like is not popular you know what does
[01:10:08] that mean it's your special bro obviously I guess that art is in the eye of the holder in many cases
[01:10:17] one might say yeah well yeah because some people they don't and maybe I misunderstood what you
[01:10:23] meant when you said the artist has to be able to draw like yeah like good first right for the
[01:10:29] breakup but a lot of artists I mean from what I understand they don't necessarily know how to
[01:10:33] like draw that good it's more of just they're like the idea behind the result kind of thing
[01:10:40] you know I don't know I'm not sure I think people just go first and they just go deeper in their head
[01:10:45] and they're like hey you know the invoke like everything in them you know that's a good point too
[01:10:50] because like with some of the old like punk rock bands that really like had a big impact
[01:10:58] it wasn't because they were good musicians it's because their emotion emotionally raw right
[01:11:05] yeah they just people heard it went whoa this is this is a different thing and so that's you could
[01:11:12] be you could be totally right and that's the same thing right you don't necessarily have to be a
[01:11:16] fine artist before you start drawing crazy stuff right or drawing abstract stuff let's say
[01:11:22] not necessarily true yeah follow in people even music like you know the guy
[01:11:26] super impressive where these guys like they may or may not even be a homeless guy but
[01:11:33] they're on the street oh yeah I got a bucket yeah and they're like shopping the bucket and
[01:11:37] they're like doing all this stuff and it sounds really like dope but it's like I don't know
[01:11:43] like is it reaching everybody well definitely not reaching anybody everybody I posted
[01:11:47] up there was some got there was like a bunch of bump of bumps I mean bumps in San Diego I was
[01:11:55] out for dinner and they were playing bluegrass you ever seen someone with a it's like a
[01:12:05] like a broom pole or whatever a broom broom stick into like a upside down wash bin
[01:12:13] with a string on it and it's a base okay well it's like what you'd see in the old days and then
[01:12:21] there's someone was plucking a banjo and someone else was playing guitar and these people
[01:12:25] were clearly they were homeless people you know they were probably between the ages of
[01:12:30] I would say maybe 20 to 20 to 26 so they're pretty young and and I was walking and I
[01:12:39] had just heard them and I was thinking man this ban sounds good right and I get up and I see
[01:12:43] they're just completely homeless and they were jamming and I actually posted it on Instagram
[01:12:50] and you know when you got done it my son I was with my son and my son was like tell us guys
[01:12:55] we're good and I said yeah I know that was impressive and what does that mean that means
[01:13:02] well your question was are they reaching everybody no they're not reaching anybody they're
[01:13:07] reaching it literally four people were standing there watching them right so what's better so is
[01:13:12] so okay I was having this debate it was a long time ago Tim Tim Ford so he was like saying
[01:13:20] Tim but he was making music or whatever and he goes deep you know with his
[01:13:28] music like what he's saying Derek's and something like whatever and he and so we're talking
[01:13:34] about it like what's better music right and he's like oh like I think basically his premise was
[01:13:40] underground rap is better than you know popular rap now and I had no dug in the fight but
[01:13:45] we were just kind of more just taunting him a little bit and he was really emotionally dug in
[01:13:51] on this one and and so I was like okay I was like well how do you prove that you know just because
[01:13:56] you like it better doesn't mean overall it's better you got to be able to measure it so I'm like okay
[01:14:00] so a little waned with the it was the song go DJ you heard that song go DJ anyway it's real popular
[01:14:07] song at the time and I happened to like it and I was like no go DJ is better than all your underground
[01:14:13] rap I just said it to trigger him I'm not saying that's a fact or nothing but but I used the
[01:14:18] measurement tools like okay how many albums have you know you guys sold like or how are we going
[01:14:23] to measure you know and we couldn't really hit the net where he couldn't really hit the nail and
[01:14:28] the head as to why it was better why underground rap is better you know but I sort of had
[01:14:32] something like this than I'm because I had the measuring tool you know but at the end of the day
[01:14:37] I think which I didn't say in the argument because you know it would have been kind of a cop out
[01:14:42] given what we're doing there is no really way to tell that's what I'm saying it's like it's all
[01:14:48] are just because it reaches just because a bunch of people I don't love go DJ that's not a
[01:14:52] life changing song but if it's on like we're going to enjoy it then there's so there's that
[01:14:57] side of the spectrum right like I don't know maybe what you're bringing spirit something like this you
[01:15:01] know some of this thing pretty deep but whatever saying it's on this side of the spectrum
[01:15:07] a lot of the time and then on the other side it's like I don't know something like super deep
[01:15:12] that not many people know about but the people who do know about it it's like man that's my life
[01:15:17] song kind of thing you know so it's a spectrum there but who's to say what's better you know well
[01:15:21] yeah well I think I'm to say what's better you know where's you uh yeah so I guess the whole
[01:15:30] point of this entire diverges that we've just taken is that just like in art and music there's a
[01:15:37] spark that you have to have and it's the same thing with leadership and so now he continues on with
[01:15:46] this thing that the people that they that the more that they learn the more that they learn from the
[01:15:51] books the better they're going to do and he says this obsessed with this thought students plunge
[01:15:56] deeper and even deeper their exertions but in and meshing them more until like myered
[01:16:03] mastodons they perish in a morass of knowledge where they first browsed for sustenance
[01:16:12] like I said Paddha good writer so you picture these big giant mastodons that you know
[01:16:16] go fall into this murred this giant pit of knowledge it's just too much for them and they die
[01:16:23] that's what happens this young leader just trying to read everything it's coming from a guy that
[01:16:28] tells you to read everything and I say that I mean Paddha's telling you you need to read but what he
[01:16:34] saying is like you can go so far to that you're you just end up well perish in a morass of knowledge
[01:16:41] and he continues on when the prime spade of the unbiased investigator has removed the
[01:16:46] muck of official reports and the mire of self-laterry biographies from the swamp of the world war
[01:16:53] then the skeletons of many such military mammoths will be discovered
[01:16:59] and what I love about this is as I as anyone knows from the books that we cover on this podcast
[01:17:07] I've said since they've day one oh why don't you cover this book about the great war this book
[01:17:12] about World War II or this this that was written by this great historian I'm like oh no I like first
[01:17:17] person accounts I actually like first person accounts as often as I came from like the front line soldiers
[01:17:22] of course I like the general stew and the card kernels that's great but I like to hear what the
[01:17:26] front line tap to say and that's that's part of what I like about his idea that just reading from this
[01:17:32] from this high altitude doesn't necessarily give you the information you need he continues on
[01:17:38] beyond questions no soldiers ever sought more diligently oh sorry he says amidst their mighty remains
[01:17:46] will lurk the elusive secret of German failure he's talking about World War I beyond question no
[01:17:53] soldiers ever sought more diligently for pre-war perfection they built and tested and adjusted their
[01:18:00] mighty machine and became so engrossed in its visible perfection in the accuracy of its bearings
[01:18:07] and the compression of its cylinders that they neglected the battery when the moment came their
[01:18:15] masterpiece proved inefficient through lack of the divine afflits which is a divine inspiration
[01:18:25] a divine thing and that is the soul of a leader so that the Germans were really rigid in the
[01:18:34] way they prepared things and again this is his viewpoint but it's a pretty good viewpoint that
[01:18:38] the Germans in World War I coming out of that prussian uh uh coming out of that that prussian
[01:18:46] mentality like this is the way we're gonna do things but they forgot that you gotta have a soul
[01:18:53] do you gotta have the soul of a leader and that's what happened to him they didn't that's what
[01:18:57] he means the battery like where's that energy come from yeah guess what those soul of the leader
[01:19:02] and he says this truly in war men are nothing a man is everything in acquiring a
[01:19:12] tradition we must live on not in our studies so in order to require great knowledge you you have to
[01:19:22] you have to live on the studies not in them we must guard against becoming so engrossed in
[01:19:27] a specific nature of the roots on bark of the trees of knowledge as to miss the meaning and
[01:19:33] grandeur of the forest that they compose that's a really complicated way of saying don't miss
[01:19:39] the forest through the trees it fails the simplicity as has been pointed out the secret of victory
[01:19:48] lies not holy in knowledge it lurks invisible in that vitalizing spark intangible yet as
[01:19:56] evident as lightning the warrior soul that's where he's in the victory lies the warrior soul
[01:20:07] we shall now seek to evaluate and place in their just ratio the three essentials to victory
[01:20:14] inspiration knowledge and force which he also calls mass we may therefore postulate that no
[01:20:22] one element be its soul knowledge or mass is dominant that a combination of any two of these factors
[01:20:28] gives a strong presumption of success over an adversary relying on one alone and that the three
[01:20:34] combined are practically invincible against a combination of the other two so here's the important
[01:20:38] things inspiration knowledge and and force or mass and he actually I'm not covered in now but he
[01:20:44] gives some examples of where these things were important through history I'm not going to cover
[01:20:48] them right now but these three things are what you need for victory he says man cannot live
[01:20:58] by bread alone and that as a man thinketh so he is have been for generations drawn from countless
[01:21:07] pulpits as the texts for proliques and unconvincing sermons until cognacy of the phrases has been
[01:21:15] somewhat dulled yet they contain an infinity of truth and I think you say this a lot it means like
[01:21:23] when you something that gets said all the time yeah there's a reason to cliche is a cliche right
[01:21:29] there's a reason people say it yeah because there's some what is he called there's some infinity of
[01:21:35] truth in there right so that's what he's saying so these things man cannot live by bread alone
[01:21:41] and as a man thinketh so he is he those are cliches but there's truth in them war is conflict
[01:21:51] fighting is an elemental exposition of the age old effort to survive it is the gold glitter of the
[01:21:57] attackers eye not the point of the questing bayonet that breaks the line oh that's good
[01:22:04] I'm going to read that one again it is the cold I said gold it is the cold
[01:22:09] glitter of the attackers eye not the point of the questioning bayonet that breaks the line
[01:22:18] it is the fierce determination determination of the driver to close with the enemy not the
[01:22:23] mechanical perfection of the tank that conquers the trench it is the cataclysmic
[01:22:30] ecstasy of conflict in the flyer not the perfection of his machine gun which drops the enemy in
[01:22:37] flaming ruin yet volumes are devoted to armaments and only pages to inspiration
[01:22:49] so these actual man the human element is more important than the bayonet than the tank
[01:22:59] and then the aircraft and then the machine gun and yet we talk about these are you know his books
[01:23:04] written about these different weapons of war but not enough written about the soul of man
[01:23:11] continuing on since by necessity limitations of map problems you go back to this this whole idea of
[01:23:19] figuring out things on a map and we're doing a terrain walk since by necessity limitations of
[01:23:23] map problems inhibit the student from considering the effects of hunger emotion personality fatigue
[01:23:30] leadership and many other imponderable yet vital factors he first neglects and then forgets them
[01:23:42] crazy right you look at this map and you figure we're maneuvering your people and you think what you've
[01:23:48] read about but you forget about the thing that I try to talk about all the time which is human nature
[01:23:53] which is understanding people understanding people understanding hunger emotion personality fatigue
[01:23:58] leadership and always imponderable things those are what you need to be concerned about as a leader
[01:24:07] going on obsessed with admiration for the intelligence which history is ascribed to leaders past
[01:24:14] he forgets the inseparable connection between plans the flower of the intellect and execution
[01:24:22] the fruit of the soul he's getting an A plus an in English class right now isn't it
[01:24:32] the inseparable connection between plans which are the flower of the intellect and execution
[01:24:38] the fruit of the soul you gotta have both you gotta have both yes you gotta have plans but then you
[01:24:46] gotta be able to execute continuing on since the historian through lack of experience and
[01:24:52] consequent appreciation of the inspirational qualities of generals fails to stress them he does
[01:24:58] emphasize their mental gifts which since he shares he values this guy was smart like me
[01:25:07] this guy was educated like me that's what made him so great just like me
[01:25:10] yeah sometimes people say that even if they aren't necessarily that you know what like me and
[01:25:16] you're alike in this way and then they'll say some cool quality that you have you know just sort of
[01:25:21] implying yeah like that yeah I'm like that too and that's what this is right oh the historians
[01:25:26] is oh this guy was very educated like I and like you said it doesn't always necessarily but he was
[01:25:33] well written sure well and that's what they stress doesn't it doesn't stress the inspirational
[01:25:40] qualities of the general doesn't stress that because he focuses on the fact that the guy was
[01:25:45] educated or the guy went to Oxford or the guy went to whatever west point is that because it's
[01:25:53] it's more concrete it's definitely more concrete but it's also it's a shared value it's like
[01:25:58] what you just said you know this guy was smart like when somebody does something when
[01:26:03] when another seal does something cool I'm like yeah we know he was in the day just like me dude
[01:26:10] then it continues on hugging the notion of intelligence he pictures armies of incident ponds
[01:26:17] moving with the precision of machines and the rapidity of light guided in their intricate and
[01:26:23] resistless evolutions over the battlefield by the cold effolgence of his emotionless celebrations
[01:26:31] as transmitted to them by wire and radio through the inspiring medium of coded messages
[01:26:40] oh that's just a get some right that's what they picture though then you know this happens today
[01:26:46] this happens today with um I just was just responding to someone on social media that was implying
[01:26:53] this exact thing that oh well you know jockel you were only been in charge of elite teams of seals
[01:27:02] and so guess what they are though those are incident ponds moving with the precision of
[01:27:07] machines and the rapidity of light like no bro actually but that's what people think they're wrong
[01:27:16] continuing doubtlessly he further assumes the same superhuman intelligence will translate
[01:27:22] those somber sentences into words of fire which shall electrify his chest men into frenzyed heroes
[01:27:30] who heedless of danger shall don'tlessly translate this stillborn infants of his brain into heroic deeds
[01:27:40] so if you think you can just put out the word and now everyone's just gonna go
[01:27:44] execute it with with undeniable tenacity and vigor you're wrong continuing on should critics have
[01:27:55] assigned to all manner of things oh sorry should critics have assigned success to all manner of things
[01:28:04] and hear some of the things that they assigned success to tactics shape of frontiers happily placed
[01:28:11] rivers mountains or woods intellectual ability or to the use of artillery all in a measure true
[01:28:18] but none vital so yeah you can be successful from all these different things and and the
[01:28:24] uh... shrewd critics say oh you were successful because this or you were successful because of that
[01:28:28] you were successful because of your tactics or your frontier or the river or the woods or whatever
[01:28:34] and it continues nor is it even the speed of the operations that the secret lays
[01:28:39] but in the inspiring spirit with which they so inoculated their soldiers as to lift weary
[01:28:46] foot-store men out of themselves and to make them march forgetful of agony that's the difference
[01:28:54] according to pattern
[01:28:58] in considering war we must avoid that adoration of the material as exemplified by scientists who
[01:29:05] deny who deny the existence of ought they cannot cut or weigh so the scientists look at it
[01:29:13] go well if you can't see it doesn't exist you can't weigh it it doesn't exist so therefore we're
[01:29:19] not going to give any credit to these things that we can't exactly wrap our hand around the magic
[01:29:27] spark as a mirror shows us not ourselves but our reflection so it is with the soul and with
[01:29:40] leadership we know them but by acts they inspire or by the results they have achieved so you don't
[01:29:48] see them you only know them by the acts that they make happen or things that are achieved through them
[01:29:53] continue on like but gets like in the armies of the great we seek the reflection of themselves
[01:30:03] and we find self-confidence enthusiasm abnegation of self loyalty and courage so this is
[01:30:11] this is big right and this is this this and we'll get into it but here's what you find self-confidence
[01:30:17] right boom this what you find self-confidence enthusiasm abnegation of self what is that right
[01:30:24] abnegation of self is denial of the self this is like this is I'm not the most important thing
[01:30:32] loyalty and courage resolution no matter how adamant
[01:30:36] made it to knowledge no matter how infinite never be gap such a progeny so being firm in your
[01:30:48] resolution and knowing a lot no matter how much of those two you have you never get as much as you get
[01:30:53] with self confidence enthusiasm abnegation of self loyalty and courage such offspring only
[01:31:00] arises from blood lines as elemental is themselves the leader must be in carnits of them now
[01:31:07] this is what we're like that's a pretty bold statement right hey here I am a leader in the army
[01:31:15] my name is general pat my name is well he's probably like a captain or maybe a major at this point
[01:31:20] when he's writing this and he's saying that in order to be a really good leader he
[01:31:24] have to be bloodline incarnate in Europe but then he says this which is awesome this is where I
[01:31:31] get a little you know he started to move a little bit out of the box here then he comes right
[01:31:36] back in the box and I had a paraphrase this one a little bit but nor is the suggestion
[01:31:41] that birth is the only means of producing such a leader there are certainly born leaders
[01:31:48] but the soldier may still overcome his natal defects by unremitting effort and practice
[01:31:57] imagine that what's that the only traverses that's what it is that's what it is I've got a book
[01:32:04] called Leadership Strategy in Tactics there's this there's a chapter in there called born or mate
[01:32:10] and the answer is both and that's the same thing that general patency in here
[01:32:16] you look you can be born a great leader but you can still overcome your natal defects
[01:32:24] just by unremitting effort and practice that's how you can get good
[01:32:31] self-confidence of the right so I think this is where he's going to start hammering through
[01:32:34] yeah so he starts hammering through this list of things so the first one is self-confidence
[01:32:38] self-confidence of the right sort as differentiated from bump-chewist presumption based in ignorance
[01:32:44] is the result of provenability the sense of conscious achievement it's existence presupposes enthusiasm
[01:32:54] for without this quality no one would endure the trail veil of acquiring self-confidence
[01:33:00] so self-confidence takes time in order to get self-confidence you have to be enthusiastic and you
[01:33:05] have to be because you have to be successful things self-confidence you get just wake up and have it
[01:33:10] you have you have it's it's conscious achievement it's provenability and the more you prove
[01:33:15] able the more confidence you're going to get which is interesting that in my new book I
[01:33:21] talk about how do you get someone to increase their confidence you're given tasks that they can
[01:33:23] achieve that's exactly what he's saying over time that's how you build up self-confidence
[01:33:28] he continues on here the enthusiasm which permits the toil and promises the achievement is simply
[01:33:33] an all absorbing preoccupation in the profession elected so when you're fired up for something
[01:33:40] when you're enthusiastic that's what allows you to overcome the toil and the times that you drop
[01:33:46] the balls that you're learning how to juggle you just keep picking them up and dirtiness
[01:33:51] of the next one endurance to is linked with self-confidence mentally it is the ability to
[01:33:55] subvert the means to an end to hit your wagon to a star and to attain it physically it presupposes
[01:34:03] sufficient enthusiasm to force on nature no matter how reluctant the obligation of constant
[01:34:10] bodily fitness through exercise hmm then he says the expanding waistline means the contracting
[01:34:19] heart line both in length and vigor and then he says witness Napoleon at and after Jenna
[01:34:30] the battle of Jenna which is where the questions figured out that they need to use maneuver
[01:34:34] warfare and decentralized command but because that's because they got crushed by Napoleon
[01:34:40] and I didn't I don't know apparently Napoleon at Jenna wasn't good shape and Napoleon after
[01:34:45] Jenna maybe he let it go so constant bodily fitness through exercise mental ability to hit your wagon
[01:34:58] to a star and attain it right that's endurance next up abnegation of self seems perhaps
[01:35:07] incongruous when applied to such selfish persons as Frederick or Napoleon but this is not the case
[01:35:15] so this is kind of funny too because right there be patting too it's patting too right
[01:35:21] I mean patting has at least a big Evan Ego as Napoleon or Frederick
[01:35:27] but this is not the case he says self can be subordinated to self
[01:35:35] the course of can leading his grenadiers at Lodi subordinated the life of bone apart to the glory
[01:35:41] of Napoleon so once again even patting you know this is a form of humility right that's what it is
[01:35:53] it's like everyone else is more important than me that's what it is
[01:35:59] next one is loyalty loyalty is frequently only considered as faithfulness from the bottom up
[01:36:04] it has another and equally important application that is from the top down one of the most frequently
[01:36:12] noted characteristics of the great who remained great is the unforgittfulness and of loyalty to their
[01:36:20] subordinates it is this characteristic which binds with hoops of iron their juniors to them
[01:36:28] a man who is truly an unselfishly loyal to his superiors is of necessity so to his juniors and
[01:36:38] they to him so this is great right loyalty up and down the chain of command you're just not
[01:36:45] loyal to the people above you you're loyal to the people below you you take care of them
[01:36:51] and if you take care of them they're going to take care of you once again it's in the book
[01:36:54] leadership strategy and tactics next courage moral and physical is almost a synonym of all
[01:37:09] forgoing traits it fosters the resolution to combat and cherishes the ability to assume
[01:37:15] responsibility the ability to assume responsibility be it for successes or failures
[01:37:22] we call that extreme ownership he says but as with biblical candle these traits and now he's
[01:37:33] that was the last trait now he's talking about all these traits these traits are of no military value
[01:37:38] if concealed a man of definite manner will never inspire confidence a cold reserve cannot
[01:37:47] be get enthusiasm and so with the others there must be an outward visible sign of the inward
[01:37:55] and spiritual grace it then appears that the leader must be an actor and such is the fact
[01:38:05] but with him as with his be wigged compare he is unconvincing unless he lives the part
[01:38:14] so yes the leader has to be an actor but guess what if the leader doesn't actually believe what he's
[01:38:19] doing it's bevons going to see through it just like an actor a be wigged actor be wigged that's like
[01:38:26] a person wearing a wig okay so because I thought when you said an actor meaning someone who takes action
[01:38:33] but he's not straight up straight up stage a person on the stage the person on the stage has to act
[01:38:39] and he's unconvincing unless he lives the part and that's why a leader's got to be you got to live it
[01:38:43] you got to think that you got to believe it stay character and if you don't believe it then
[01:38:49] everyone's going to see through it yeah that's kind of truth everybody you know people like
[01:38:57] are you we back in the day when I was a personal trainer and you get a personal trainer who's like
[01:39:02] an out of shape you know okay but they you know according to them they know everything kind of
[01:39:07] thing is like brigh and kind of kind of I mean we can see it on you obviously but yeah if you feel that
[01:39:11] you know so yeah you're not going to follow them clear your way more apt to follow you know some
[01:39:20] if someone's a fitness instructor someone that's a good shape yes but more important for me
[01:39:29] is if you don't really believe in what you're saying as a leader everyone can see it and where
[01:39:35] this really comes into play then this is such a incredible thing and I've talked about it over
[01:39:43] and over again and I put it there's a new addition of dichotomy leadership that I talk about this
[01:39:50] I think it was the Barnes and Noble edition they put like a section in there that I had written this
[01:39:54] article about and I talk about it in leadership strategy and tactics and that's this if
[01:40:00] if your goal is to take care of yourself everyone can see it you're going to fail that's the
[01:40:06] way it is like if your goal if you're if you're willing to step on people and cross them in order
[01:40:10] to move up the chain of command everyone's going to see it and you're going to fail now look you
[01:40:14] might get a couple wins here and there I get it but long term you're going to fail
[01:40:20] if your goal is to take care of your team and accomplish the mission that's what your true goal is
[01:40:25] number one you're going to be successful in taking care of the team and successful in
[01:40:30] accomplish the mission and then guess what a by-product is you will be successful as well
[01:40:36] but the minute you say well wait a second maybe I'll just focus on myself for a second it's the wrong
[01:40:40] move it's the wrong move what you want to do is say how can I best take care of my people that's
[01:40:45] what you want to say that's what you want to believe that's what you want to do and if you do that
[01:40:49] you take care of your people and you take care of your mission and that's where the way you're
[01:40:53] operating everyone can see it up and down the chain of command by the way and eventually that will play
[01:41:01] out correctly if you're looking to take care of you people will see that up and down the chain of
[01:41:09] command and eventually that will play out incorrectly and then he says can a man acquire and demonstrate
[01:41:22] these characteristics that's these characteristics self confidence endurance obligation of self
[01:41:28] loyalty and courage can a man then acquire and demonstrate these characteristics the answer is
[01:41:37] they have they can four as a man thinketh so is he so all these things if you think this way
[01:41:51] you can become that way and he finishes this out by saying this the fixed determination to acquire
[01:42:01] the warrior soul and have acquired it to either conquer or perish with honor
[01:42:09] is the secret to victory George S. Paton Jr. major March 26th 1926 so
[01:42:31] this guy's got a lot of a lot of things to talk about we might be rolling into a third session
[01:42:37] next time delivering knowledge and I think it's just so important to think about these things especially
[01:42:51] a guy that's controversial like paton you know there's there's another quote about paton you know
[01:42:56] because they called paton old blood guts and there's there's a quote about paton that someone
[01:43:03] else said it was our blood his guts you know so there's some like that's a rough statement right
[01:43:10] that's a rough statement so there's controversy you know around paton there's controversy about
[01:43:17] some of the things that he did you know there's the whole episode of him slapping around
[01:43:23] some of the guys that had left the front lines for various reasons that were not ham physically wounded
[01:43:29] so some of the guys had some mental trauma you know whether they were shell shocked and what's
[01:43:35] interesting about this is this is this is one of I'm sure we can get into but I'm reading another book
[01:43:41] written by a by a leader in World War II and he's I was just reading this section where these
[01:43:48] guys are coming to him crying we need you I can't take it anymore and one guy does it and he's like
[01:43:58] you know talk to him and you know says get back on the line the next guy comes and you know he's
[01:44:04] crying he's distraught he's like I need to get off the line I can't take anymore and the guy says
[01:44:09] you know Smith just came to me with these problems he did a much better job acting than you're doing
[01:44:16] so my point and the guy eventually broke down and just said yeah but I mean I just it's really hard
[01:44:20] and he says look I know it's hard everyone's having hard time you can do this my point is
[01:44:25] when you had there was people that were shirking their duty there were people that were
[01:44:30] look everyone was scared patented says it a thousand times everyone was scared
[01:44:35] whether someone actually had you know shell shock who knows
[01:44:41] certainly when you talk about caring about your people and you get somebody in a bad situation
[01:44:46] I mean Dick Winters talked about this when these guys were freaking out on the front lines how
[01:44:49] he would handle it certainly wasn't by slapping around but that all is I'm saying it's that there's
[01:44:54] controversy around pat and yet he's got great you take that controversy as part of what you can
[01:45:03] learn at least I do and definitely a ton of perspective that he has so we'll we'll look at
[01:45:13] people keep looking at patting I believe maybe not next episode but no no you never know what that
[01:45:19] next episode's gonna bring I do know this I did some live gigs around America sure
[01:45:28] they're they're over now when this podcast comes out the last two were Seattle and San Francisco
[01:45:33] which both sold out which was awesome so to everyone that went to the jockel live shows around the
[01:45:38] country thank you and for everyone that's asked for more looks like I'm gonna do some more so
[01:45:46] jockel live we'll put that out soon on when these next ones will happen and the other thing is
[01:45:54] the leadership strategy tactics and feel manual that I talked about today a couple times and just
[01:46:00] just want to say thanks to everybody it's it's been crazy that the sales have been great and I know
[01:46:07] that's all because you all are out there getting after it's spread in the word made it number one
[01:46:11] and a bunch of different a bunch of different outlets that actually measure this stuff so believe
[01:46:19] me that every time I think about that I think about everyone that that listens to this podcast
[01:46:25] and that spread the word and you know bought yourself a first of this and by the way there was
[01:46:33] some controversy someone sent a picture on social media and that cover was different and said you
[01:46:39] know I waited as too long and I got the second edition I said no you're in Europe or you're in England
[01:46:44] I think England New Zealand Europe and and basically outside America there's a different cover
[01:46:49] it's still first edition as of right now cool why is there a different cover you know what
[01:46:57] I guess they have different styles or something that hey this is they they just said hey this is the
[01:47:05] this is not the way books look over here and you know I just said I just said Roger that I'm not from
[01:47:13] New Zealand I'm not from Australia I'm not from England I'm not from Germany I'm from America
[01:47:20] and if you're telling me that this is like in the book it's not that much different but it's different
[01:47:26] but apparently that's normal you know and yeah make sense oh yeah I mean I don't you know I
[01:47:33] try and keep my ego in check right I'm not George S. Pat and saying I'm right and history will prove it
[01:47:42] I'm not thinking that and when somebody tells me something that's a professional and another arena
[01:47:46] I go okay well maybe explain it to me you know and actually I did say that to them and they sent me a bunch
[01:47:51] of other books it said hey here's like this is what books like look like over here your book will not look like a book even
[01:47:57] yeah maybe I'm wrong you know I could have been wrong I could have said you know what let's hold the line and maybe
[01:48:02] people would be looking at it going oh yeah this I'm getting this book I don't know yeah well it kind of
[01:48:08] makes sense if you consider the concept right you know like you know some cars here like if they're
[01:48:13] super exotic they'll have the steering wheel on the other side of the road or the other side of the
[01:48:16] the car it'll be on the right side yeah you know I wouldn't call that super exotic that's just a car
[01:48:21] that was built in the front country right but yeah okay period okay so let's say you're shopping for a car
[01:48:27] and then you see like the steering wheel on the rear wheel it should have really made it would hey I'm not really
[01:48:32] used to that you know and you could say ergonomically or whatever but you know if you
[01:48:37] it's pretty quick to get it or for whatever mental reason doesn't even matter it's like the
[01:48:41] chasm that needs to be crossed yeah we need to tighten that up a little bit yeah but if you go to Australia
[01:48:47] right that's everybody same same so it's like boom we're used to that here where you see this here
[01:48:52] on many different levels you know something's bigger than the other okay the car thing that's
[01:48:56] probably in the side of the spectrum but the last book covers movie posters we used to
[01:49:02] move poster if it doesn't look like a movie poster like how is that even gonna land as a movie
[01:49:07] poster same same yeah so that's what we did so I guess the point is if you got the other cover
[01:49:13] you're still good I'll still be I'll still still get you some knuckles on the first edition
[01:49:18] when I opened up now I might open it up and it might say third a day that's different in which
[01:49:23] case you know let me just look I'm not gonna I'm not gonna I'm not gonna embarrass you in front
[01:49:31] everybody but I'm gonna look at you you're gonna know I'm gonna know that you didn't get the first
[01:49:37] edition there's still first edition available right now but not much more they are running
[01:49:43] around that second but so anyways I want to say thanks to everyone for all that super stoked and I
[01:49:53] appreciate appreciate now speaking of acquiring a warrior soul which I know is a little bit of
[01:50:03] a bold statement it is but we know from patent that we can move in the right direction as far as
[01:50:12] improving our categories that we want improvement it can move us towards being a little bit
[01:50:20] stronger a little bit better a little bit faster a little bit more of a warrior anything you can
[01:50:26] recommend that could help us with that to be able to tactical advice for us maybe either conquer
[01:50:32] or perish with honor yeah we can take jujitsu really that's really what it is what jujitsu is I mean
[01:50:39] I don't want to say really that's what it is but we'll just say that's a part of it to conquer or
[01:50:43] perish with honor sure if mean you're about to roll and I we're gonna shake hands because it's a part
[01:50:51] of the the deal it's not a rule but it's kind of it's not honorable thing respect what if instead of
[01:50:56] shaking my hand I'm surprised you with like a guillotine or something like that I conquered but not
[01:51:01] with honor well when I escape the guillotine sure okay all right then you are gonna pay right
[01:51:07] then I'm the one who's gonna perish and by the way if you're well I know this is happening but
[01:51:12] it happened to me like where somebody's all excited like all amped up and they think they're big
[01:51:16] gate sure and so you go to shake their hand and like they either a don't and by the way we're
[01:51:23] not talking like a formal hand shake as if we just signed a NATO peace treaty we know we're just
[01:51:28] talking a little bump in roll right yeah it's a little little little little slap bump in roll
[01:51:32] that's all we're talking about but occasionally especially especially this happens if you're going
[01:51:37] with someone that like is really trying to kill you and then you submit them and then they're gonna
[01:51:43] go again but they're so engrossed in like okay we're gonna make you get you this time they're like
[01:51:48] forget they're like their minds insane yes yeah yeah that's uh that's good dubs or you can go
[01:51:55] instead further I don't think I've ever done that by the way I don't think I've ever got so
[01:52:00] amped up that I like just lost my mind I think you have I've done it jokingly you know I think you've
[01:52:07] done it where you've gotten to the point where you're you want to go again so bad that you've that
[01:52:14] like I'll put my hand up and you'll like get reminded of me like oh yeah we're actually like friends
[01:52:21] I could be wrong I don't know and overall you're wrong but put it this way over all your
[01:52:26] general way because yeah as frustrated as I've ever gotten with you which is like pretty frustrated
[01:52:33] yeah like deep deep in golfing frustration there was always like a little governor on there where
[01:52:39] it's like even like my expressions of frustration like there's always a hint of like joke in there
[01:52:45] like to genuine I don't think I've ever that's not even how I get for it that's not how I look
[01:52:51] when I get for really like frustrated like I'll get more quiet than anything but with you it's like
[01:52:58] and we said talk about this before where you're so like you can take kind of anything you know like
[01:53:02] if I cheat with you like my straight up like you're rolling with any and I jump on your back and I
[01:53:07] put a real choke in make you tap or whatever I feel like you can like take that you know like you
[01:53:13] won't be all mad at me not externally anyway but you know I feel like you can just take
[01:53:18] externally that would be retro music yes yeah but I'm just a favor but you see what I say won't
[01:53:26] damage the relationship in any way you know like I feel like like you can kind of take these kinds of
[01:53:30] things so it's almost like I'm in like a little free arena I believe me that's it's a good thing
[01:53:42] I feel what I'm saying is I feel comfortable to just be like you know F u or whatever
[01:53:47] I find sneak attacks on the GG2 map somewhat offensive yeah yeah so I'm what I'm telling you
[01:53:53] to tell me that yep I've had a couple people do it over the years like you know like
[01:53:59] tap someone out and like hey we were over by the wall and like kind of just turn my back to start
[01:54:06] going back towards the center and have someone jump on my back and like put a choking yeah
[01:54:10] that's that's cool but I'm first of all like I'm gonna get out and then I'm gonna you're gonna pay
[01:54:15] because that's just you know that's you know what it is yeah and I think what offends me about it is
[01:54:21] the like you can tell that their ego has flared up and they're trying to recover that or whatever
[01:54:29] and so that maybe it is my ego that starts to flare up and I but I feel more like it's uh it's a
[01:54:35] scenario where someone's outwine right underneath the there needs to be a lesson that gets taught
[01:54:42] right at that point yeah I think you're right and I agree where and somebody actually also
[01:54:47] asked me this on social media really recently which was like hey going with the guy he's grinding
[01:54:53] his knuckles into my neck the whole time like into my face and he's like so I got on top and just
[01:54:59] like mounted and like punished him with neon stomach or something like that is that is that bad
[01:55:05] you know and there's a little bit of a question and I was like no it's proved like if someone
[01:55:09] wants to get all freaking hostile and kind of I don't use the word dirty because it's not really dirty
[01:55:15] but it's what would you call that what would you call that what they call it in Portuguese it's like
[01:55:20] grosser right it's means like like kind of brutal yeah like if someone's getting crazy with me like that
[01:55:26] then I'll probably put some kind of uh some kind of uh slightly increased measure back on them right
[01:55:35] just slightly increased yeah not I'm not it's not like I'm gonna all know I'm gonna break
[01:55:39] someone's on the ground not at all but yeah if you want to you know grab hold of my whatever
[01:55:45] and start squeezing it's like okay cool yeah you're gonna it's weird because the that one's
[01:55:50] on emotional by the way so you're like okay cool yeah I see where you're at right
[01:55:55] that's not not cool and here's how you can know yeah it can be tricky though because some
[01:56:00] because there's different levels of that like some people literally don't know what they're doing
[01:56:04] yeah and so much like the man just relax bro you know sometimes like hey I
[01:56:08] probably should have said that to this guy too like just being like hey man if you get crazy with
[01:56:13] people they might get crazy with you what you want to do is try and learn and try to have a good
[01:56:17] time this isn't actual combat we're just having fun we're trying to learn so if you should
[01:56:21] you should really go with that approach you know that's smart that's a smart yes because he
[01:56:25] is a level don't know yeah they don't know and then then there's like this intermediary level where
[01:56:30] they know but it's not aimed at you specifically it's aimed at sort of everyone you know you know
[01:56:35] the kind you know the kind of they come maybe come from an environment where it's like that or
[01:56:39] you know so it's like their whole attitude towards any competition is like crush you kill you
[01:56:45] like you're my enemy kind of thing and they just have this kind of subconscious attitude about
[01:56:49] here so that's how they roll and then then you get on the other side of spectrum which I think
[01:56:54] is the ideal candidate for the repercussions is kind of where he's like mad at you maybe not even
[01:57:02] necessarily because it's you but just he's having a bad day or he's just like frustrated because
[01:57:06] he's not winning or whatever kind of thing and then he's kind of he's turning it up a notch like
[01:57:11] and how you say he's stepping out of line and that's what it is it's like you're you're stepping
[01:57:16] slightly outside of like the mutual like respectful agreement of this friendly like training
[01:57:22] slash competition and the other thing is you gotta remember is like when I roll with Andy
[01:57:29] like man we're smashing each other I mean it's full he's you know we're we'll do whatever like
[01:57:35] it's full we might as well be competing for you know the world championships because if there's
[01:57:41] a chance where he's trying to choke me and I've got my chin down he'll he'll choke my face no
[01:57:47] no doubt about it I'll do the same thing like but if I was wrong with someone I didn't really
[01:57:51] train with all the time and they bury their chin up again okay I'll go for an unlock or whatever you
[01:57:54] know you're not just you're not just putting your forearm across there across there mandible
[01:57:59] and cranking it as hard as you can to open up a neck exposure or just get him to tap from that right
[01:58:04] you know so yeah and that's that's a subtle kind of dance he got as you too with like who you
[01:58:09] roll with or whatever but I think generally speaking there's like an understanding where I think we all
[01:58:14] sort of understand where yeah like that if you're real close with someone and you already know you
[01:58:19] guys are used to that competition you can take it a little bit further yeah yeah for sure
[01:58:23] and then even on top of that we're like and this I guess goes for people who you're at least
[01:58:28] have a good rapport with whether it's with a man not where okay so there's you know Isaiah right
[01:58:33] he's one of the MFA okay so we'll roll or whatever and sometimes it'll go into in this ongoing
[01:58:40] scramble right so like one time he was like it was an ongoing scramble I don't know if he was on
[01:58:45] purpose going outside of the mat like outside of the door he kind of did like to escape but he went
[01:58:51] outside of the mat and I just chased him outside and jumped on his head I wear out in the
[01:58:55] knot on the mat anymore over by the water fountain you know but I chased him not because no
[01:59:00] know this it's still on it was like halfway joking you know get it like who we're still fighting
[01:59:04] but it was like joking you know sometimes people do that like serious you know like you're hitting
[01:59:09] the mop in the corner and there's still a drain of go so so here's here's the important part of
[01:59:15] this whole thing if the the reason that this is important is because if you and I are in a real fight
[01:59:28] and you crank my face that doesn't mean anything I can I'm just gonna I'm like what am I going
[01:59:37] to do I'm gonna try and bite you right there's with if you're cranking my face I'm not going to tap
[01:59:43] to it you know so it is not a legit thing unless it opens up a choke right if you can make the
[01:59:52] pain open up a choke with and that's fine I guess what I'm saying is there's things that you
[01:59:56] could do to somebody like for here's another one breaking someone's finger right like I could grab
[02:00:00] three or fingers if we were in a real fight grab two or fingers grab one of your fingers and just
[02:00:05] break it does that end the fight no it doesn't end the fight and in fact it has a not a huge impact
[02:00:12] on the fight immediately right you know like it's not gonna end the fight immediately so therefore
[02:00:20] for me to grab at your fingers and try and break one of your fingers is not good training partner
[02:00:29] because it doesn't really impact the the the fight look it has a small impact in the fight but
[02:00:37] like I got you right and this is a good one because I've had people trying to
[02:00:41] gouge out my eyes before it's it doesn't change the outcome of the fight at that moment look
[02:00:47] if you get your finger and deep enough because I I have not done this but I've had friends
[02:00:51] that have dug in for eyes and it can it's definitely it makes people react right but
[02:00:58] if someone's a trained fighter it's not this game changer it's not as a game changer as a
[02:01:05] choke is yeah so therefore me going hey you can just attack my eyes and we're good
[02:01:12] no because if you do that guess what I'm gonna have scratches on my eyes and yet it doesn't mean
[02:01:18] that you could ever beat me it just means that I've scratched on my eyes doesn't change the outcome
[02:01:22] so I guess there's the there's the strange part about this we're not the strange part that's
[02:01:26] in some important because we do train hard we train hard for a reason yeah that's one of the
[02:01:31] best things about you did so you can go 99% you can go 100% and hey if I get your normal
[02:01:37] you tap if you give me an arm lock I tap cool then we go again if I gouge out your eye
[02:01:44] it we can't go again and realistically it's hard to gouge out someone and I and it didn't
[02:01:50] really change the outcome of fight because you'll still be fighting with one eye yeah so anyways at least
[02:01:56] okay yeah and even if you're training for actually fighting or whatever like an outside of MMA I
[02:02:03] guess but here's a good one biting off someone's ear right you know Igor yeah that's what made me think of
[02:02:11] it so so Igor you know he got into a street fight and you know you you're all these people say
[02:02:17] you know you rip off someone's ear they're gonna be done you know that's what somebody bit off
[02:02:21] Igor's ear and he could he like I remember I was like bro and I said well what happened he
[02:02:29] goes on like I got I got a side control and then you know mount and finish them you know with his ear
[02:02:38] off big giant chunk of his ear golf yeah I mean visibly gone forever yeah you know Mike Tyson's
[02:02:44] stuff yeah Mike Tiger bigger than Mike Tyson so this idea that all just bite this guy's here it's like
[02:02:49] that's why if you and I were to go to train today and I'm like you know what just to make it
[02:02:54] more realistic I'm gonna bite your ear off and then you're like bro what are you doing in your
[02:02:57] stop does that mean I went no it means we lost in training yeah and I got a false sense of security
[02:03:04] thinking that just biting off your ear would stop you when the reality is when it happened to Igor
[02:03:09] he just was like oh cool now you're really tired so I know there's some guy that was on the
[02:03:16] receiving end of that that's probably listening right now going on which I wouldn't have bitten that
[02:03:19] guys ear because no man heavily paid the price and no one because this is the thing to bring us back
[02:03:27] to jiu-jiu-jiu the the jiu-jiu that you train every single day is effective it's very effective
[02:03:36] you don't need to bite you don't need to pull hair you don't need to galge eyes sure you can add
[02:03:41] that stuff it's fine no real situation it's fine but the fundamentals that you know are infinitely
[02:03:47] more powerful than these little additional things that you might think in your brain or a game
[02:03:52] changer they're not yes thank you so jiu-jitsu so we want to train it let's go with that premise we
[02:03:59] want to train jiu-jitsu do you have any recommendations on what we should utilize to train jiu-jitsu
[02:04:04] yes discipline but a tire wise we're gonna go gui no gui boom so uniform for gui is a gui you
[02:04:13] know from for no gui is not a gui it's a rash guy anyway best guis in the world factually
[02:04:20] are from origin so go to origin main dot com you don't even have to ask anymore what gui I should get
[02:04:26] get an origin gui and take your pick I don't care whatever color you like I'll put that yeah and

[02:06:30] discipline go the pill and the can can is like the energy drink delivery system yeah we don't
[02:06:37] like to say energy drink because energy drinks generally speaking are not healthy got the stigma
[02:06:44] well not it's a it's an earned stigma they got a ton of sugar in them they got a bunch of nasty
[02:06:50] chemicals yes but this one does not this does not but if you take away the nasty chemicals
[02:06:56] of all the sugar and that's hard as if can caffeine excessive caffeine 300 400 milligrams of caffeine
[02:07:04] you do not need that in one can yes so take away all those negative things you we have
[02:07:10] everything else is is essentially energy drink material so it's I think it's just a stigma
[02:07:18] okay it has a lightning bolt from the logo true it's in one of those little things yeah it is
[02:07:24] a can oh yeah that's true that's not because it's an energy drink because it's traffic thunder
[02:07:28] yeah and then it's in one of those little slim cans because lemon lime doesn't have a it has a
[02:07:34] little little lemon lime on it on the citric citric citric citric citric citric
[02:07:40] wedge and then the logo okay okay yeah yeah so yeah exception little twist there if you will
[02:07:46] nonetheless if you like energy drinks but you're like hey I'm not down for all that that
[02:07:51] negative noise boom right here that's a delivery system and also speaking of vitamin

[02:09:39] listen to your podcasts subscribe yep and on also we have the grounded podcast which we
[02:09:44] almost just recorded one when we went on this big tangent just admitted to go put grounded
[02:09:49] podcast we talk about all things life jiu jitsu and you can check that one out also the warrior
[02:09:53] kid podcast for kids and don't forget about the warrior kid soap made by Aiden and the new soap is out
[02:10:02] you see the logo yes so dope it's called killer soap it's got ingredients in it that help
[02:10:13] deter micro microbials micro microbies and funguses got all to get rid of that stuff
[02:10:23] so if your person that does something called jiu jitsu you probably want some of this and you know
[02:10:28] it's really cool about it it's black the soap is black because it's got charcoal here good thing
[02:10:35] yeah so so there you go get yourself some killer soap by a young kid he started a business no big deal
[02:10:43] started it when he was like 11 started his own business got goats and decided what can I make with
[02:10:50] goat milk oh I know what I can make soap killer soap which allows everyone in the world
[02:10:58] just take lead oh my very nice also youtube we have a youtube channel official where echo
[02:11:06] Charles is constantly trying his utmost to make a viral video he's got the ingredients he's got the
[02:11:16] formula can he to can he pull it off I think my hypothesis that'll never be categorized beyond
[02:11:24] hypothesis I think I don't think you can make a viral video like like that like you can't
[02:11:31] know after you like okay I'm gonna formulate there is no formula for the
[02:11:35] I'm interesting to find out if anyone's ever said okay I'm gonna make a viral video and then it
[02:11:39] worked I would think that there's some people like on youtube like youtube stars or whatever
[02:11:47] that they can make consistent viral videos well that depends yeah yeah sir yes sir but yeah I
[02:11:54] think it depends on what you mean my viral video because technically god what I understand my
[02:11:58] video is like it just comes kind of from this real source and then it goes viral so so if the platform
[02:12:05] is already too big yeah I got 10 million subscribers and he gets 11 million views is that a viral video
[02:12:11] okay point taken but the thing so the question is has a viral video ever been manufactured
[02:12:17] proactively with intention yeah I sure somebody's muscle yeah I'm sure someone had a really good
[02:12:23] idea and just came it hit him and they were like you know what and they just scored it was more
[02:12:28] of a whole thing it wasn't a guaranteed thing but it was just like hey man this I don't see how
[02:12:32] this couldn't go viral kind of thing and they just happen to be right you know but I don't know
[02:12:36] that there's a formula that someone can follow the rest in the event of us us making a viral video
[02:12:42] this was gonna be me that would be you making viral videos no but you're the talent though so what
[02:12:48] they call it officially you're the talent person in front of the can have been word rough shape bro
[02:12:53] the lesson yes good editing yeah well I'm gonna do my best and subscribe to that channel
[02:13:03] you can watch echo Charles and I talk about skinny knees or what have you I think that's the most
[02:13:13] I think that's the best the funniest video might not be the best but it's it's it's it's
[02:13:18] pretty funny I watch it once every two months and I still laugh every yeah there's some last to be
[02:13:24] I won't agree with that psychological warfare if you need a little help getting over a moment of
[02:13:29] weakness you're not alone you're not alone I will be there with you press play on your MP3

[02:17:26] And thanks to those of you that are out there in uniform,
[02:17:32] the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, the coast,
[02:17:35] guardmen who protect our way of life every day
[02:17:38] and to our police and law enforcement,
[02:17:41] to the firefighters, to the paramedics and EMTs,

[02:17:56] And to everyone.
[02:18:00] Remember what patent?
[02:18:04] Remember what patent taught us,
[02:18:05] not only about war and leadership,
[02:18:09] but about life.
[02:18:11] And that is the fact that we all have weaknesses.
[02:18:13] We all have shortfalls.
[02:18:15] No one was born perfect,
[02:18:18] but we can still overcome.
[02:18:22] We can overcome our NATO defects
[02:18:25] through unremitting effort and practice.
[02:18:31] And as he told his own son,
[02:18:34] you can be born with a soul capable of correct military
[02:18:39] reactions or the body capable of having big muscles,
[02:18:43] but both qualities must be developed
[02:18:46] by a hard work.
[02:18:51] So don't sit back and accept the hand
[02:18:56] that you've been dealt negative.
[02:19:01] Instead, overcome your weaknesses,
[02:19:05] capitalize on your strikes by getting out there
[02:19:11] and getting after it.
[02:19:14] And until next time,
[02:19:16] this is echo and jockel out.
