and how you say he's stepping out of line and that's what it is it's like you're you're stepping slightly outside of like the mutual like respectful agreement of this friendly like training slash competition and the other thing is you gotta remember is like when I roll with Andy like man we're smashing each other I mean it's full he's you know we're we'll do whatever like it's full we might as well be competing for you know the world championships because if there's a chance where he's trying to choke me and I've got my chin down he'll he'll choke my face but you see what I say won't damage the relationship in any way you know like I feel like like you can kind of take these kinds of things so it's almost like I'm in like a little free arena I believe me that's it's a good thing I feel what I'm saying is I feel comfortable to just be like you know F u or whatever I find sneak attacks on the GG2 map and I think it's just so important to think about these things especially a guy that's controversial like paton you know there's there's another quote about paton you know because they called paton old blood guts and there's there's a quote about paton that someone else said it was our blood his guts you know so there's some like that's a rough statement right that's a rough statement so there's controversy you know around paton there's controversy about some of the things that he did you know there's the whole episode of him slapping around some of the guys that had left the front lines for various reasons that were not ham physically wounded so some of the guys had some mental trauma you know whether they were shell shocked and what's interesting about this is this is this is one of I'm sure we can get into but I'm reading another book written by a by a leader in World War II yeah like deep deep in golfing frustration there was always like a little governor on there where it's like even like my expressions of frustration like there's always a hint of like joke in there like to genuine but whatever saying it's on this side of the spectrum a lot of the time and then on the other side it's like I don't know something like super deep that not many people know about but the people who do know about it it's like man that's my life song kind of thing you know I've had a couple people do it over the years like you know like tap someone out and like hey we were over by the wall and like kind of just turn my back to start going back towards the center and have someone jump on my back and like put a choking yeah like good first right for the breakup but a lot of artists I mean from what I understand they don't necessarily know how to like draw that good it's more of just they're like the idea behind the result kind of thing you know hey you know the invoke like everything in them you know that's a good point too because like with some of the old like punk rock bands that really like had a big impact it wasn't because they were good musicians it's because their emotion emotionally raw right so like one time he was like it was an ongoing scramble I don't know if he was on purpose going outside of the mat like outside of the door he kind of did like to escape you know the old school art right that real valuable art like you know Picasso and others then you have these master foragers where are they on this whole thing maybe like I mean I think they're like the technical guitarist that can lay down the riff exactly you can't tell the difference like hey I probably should have said that to this guy too like just being like hey man if you get crazy with people they might get crazy with you what you want to do is try and learn and try to have a good time this isn't actual combat we're just having fun we're trying to learn so if you should you should really go with that approach you know that's smart that's a smart and we said talk about this before where you're so like you can take kind of anything you know like if I cheat with you like my straight up like you're rolling with any and they can achieve a good level but the people that can go next level are the people that can take those things and apply them in different ways different situations different scenarios and then create things out of it that's the difference between or not even but up this is I think someone can be just a good applyer and be a world champion in jjitsu like someone that studies and is great and knows the moves they can be a world champion but to be like the elite of the elite you got to have that next level you got to be able to take those things and apply create next level and actually I did say that to them and they sent me a bunch of other books it said hey here's like this is what books like look like over here your book will not look like a book I got a bunch of books leaders of strategy and tactics field manual thank you all spread the word writer review on amazon and then get way the warrior kid the whole series one two and three marks mission where there's a will and way the warrior kid Mikey the dragons for the little kid discipline equals freedom field manual for the older kid that needs to be on the path the audio version of that is on MP3 platforms as well and then of course extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership that is the books I wrote with my brother Dave babin laying out the principles of leadership that will help you in business and life and if you need more help than that we have echelon front which are leadership consultancy where we solve problems through leadership you're going to echelon front dot com for that e f on line that's echelon front online leadership training because leadership is not an inoculation we got the muster coming up in 2019 where we're going to be we're going to be in Orlando we're going to be in Dallas and we're going to be in phoenix Arizona go to extremo ownership dot com everyone of these that we have done has sold out these are going to sell out too well and that's what they stress doesn't it doesn't stress the inspirational qualities of the general doesn't stress that because he focuses on the fact that the guy was educated or the guy went to Oxford or the guy went to whatever west point is that because it's it's more concrete it's definitely more concrete but it's also it's a shared value it's like what you just said you know this guy was smart like when somebody does something when when another seal does something cool I'm like but it was like joking you know sometimes people do that like serious you know like you're hitting the mop in the corner and there's still a drain of go Yeah, or even like if you, and not that this would happen all the time or whatever, I don't know, but like if you just tips over or something, and it's like, oh, we got to get out of here I think my hypothesis that'll never be categorized beyond hypothesis I think I don't think you can make a viral video like like that like you can't know after you
