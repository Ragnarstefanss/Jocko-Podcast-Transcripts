you know he was stepping in to help out and the guy came back and killed him and his friend was hit everyone hard Brett was a really popular guy and so coach Sharat he and again this is something that that Brian Stanton talked about you know when they were heading to the funeral and there we go let's do an exercise this is this is coach Sharat talking let's do an exercise I'd like you to both close your eyes and picture that you're leaving a building a friend picks you up and takes you to a place where people are somber crying and there seems to be an audience then you realize you're at your own funeral right down a few words about what you'd want a family member a person of faith to say when reflecting on the lives of Travis Manion or Brian Stanton Stanton nodded and after a few minutes of pondering what to write started drawing down a sentence about one day being remembered as a good husband or loving father and a US Marine Travis went through several pieces of paper before settling on one sentence Travis Manion was a man on a phrase to stand for what was right and as I mentioned earlier Travis started helping out Brian with his wrestling and and eventually as Brian started fighting because Brian's a maniac started doing MMA matches and he needed corner man so he needed to have the wrestling corner man and so again this is something that we covered with Brian's stand but for if you didn't hear it that first time there you got Brian's about to fight he's literally you know whatever 20 minutes half an hour from getting in the cage and fighting somebody and Travis gets a phone call and Brian can tell something's going on and Brian said hey tell me what's going on Travis says I'll tell you later Brian Stanton says you tell me now Travis looks away after the fight no give it to me straight Brian demanded what's going on and then Travis tells him JP Blacksmith was killed in Felusal last night so again your point is that these are people you know real close to home and it was tough for for Brian it's tough for anyone that's sitting on the sidelines which is what you feel like you feel like you can't you you want to help and you can't do anything you're back you're literally thousands miles away and that's what these guys are are feeling you a lot of frustration there Travis said but I'm wondering if you might consider leaving a bit later possibly after sunset my concern is that our presence during daylight could endanger neighbors who live near the house we're gonna strike not to mention little children who could be playing in the street respectfully lieutenant I wouldn't want to be the one to tell their parents that their son or daughter might still be alive if we had waited a couple more hours after a pause in a sip of water the Iraqi officer nodded the raid would not start until 8 PM so again real leadership and I talk about this all the time in here you know the real leaders aren't barking orders the real leaders are the ones that are flanking and using indirect approaches sure with the people that they're trying to influence and there's just a phenomenal example of that got some email here email coming from Travis sent it to you you know sent it to the family and and some of his buddies sent to bring in as well here we go all my job is definitely going well after all the horror stories we hear we heard about the Iraqi armoured army and their unwillingness to work with the myths they have been very open and willing to listen to advice creating an initial relationship with my counterparts was the right move and it has allowed me to help them start shaping operations there are many dedicated men in this army and it's been an eye opening experience so far the best IAs that's Iraqi army soldier the best IAs are definitely dedicated to their cause and have a warrior mentality that rivals some Americans however there are still those enemies out there that wish us to fail there's a lot of work left to do but the city is definitely at a different place that it was last year I really feel that is it is at a critical point where if the present situation continues to progress it could have huge positive impact in other areas also I found a good balance between my logistics job and my company advisor role although going on operations definitely requires a good amount of time I'm able to work with the batalion logistics officer on a fairly regular basis I also appreciate all the good food and gear that has been sent workouts and your support have definitely helped keep me going as I said before we're pretty busy if I wanted to take a minute to thank you guys for everything and keep you updated please continue to write and enjoy your updates as well take care and I'll talk to you soon to simplify Travis yeah I always remember that that discussion we had you know down the hallway and so impacted him to be there with those guys and he actually went up there to thank them for all they had done and he said dad they couldn't thank me enough for for my tour and what I was about to do and he was you know he he got real serious about it you know as remember that was one of the last conversations I had with him interesting side note to that story so my wife and I after we lost Travis went up to rescue one talk to the guys we were up there and they sort of remember maybe you know somebody coming through and but it never really clicked for the guys who were with but great guys and you know we end up leaving and never felt like we had the connection that we expected because Travis had talked about it so much and a couple years later I say about two years ago yeah man start looking what you can do on the outside you know why don't you go get a job there's some good jobs you know they got some good jobs you can get you know you can be an executive there's you know you could there's probably a good cubicle that would have a nice computer at it for you and everything I took but I would be not even be sarcastic about I just try and make them start thinking about what regular I mean you want to see all teams it's a ridiculously good life I mean it's it's a ridiculously good life so the minute you start looking at normal jobs in the world you want to get back in the cage so now he comes back and he ends up with a new roommate new roommate at the Naval Academy named Brendan Looney and I'm going to the book here Brendan and Travis who carried the burden of being division one athletes along with their academic and drilling responsibility rarely if ever complained just after the start of the 2001 fall semester Travis and Brendan met up from early morning run the restaurant football player both had practice later on that afternoon but as two varsity athletes who wanted to be the best they were determined to work harder than everyone else after talking about the start the NFL season their mid-job conversation shifted to their backgrounds they had a lot in common including the love of sports and their love of country both midship men had been raised Catholic the tight-knit families although Brendan's was a little larger with Brent Brendan had four a total of five I think total five siblings so they're continuing they're doing a little bit more Travis has continued to direct his troops in this training operation and finally the voice comes on again lieutenant manion this is coyote six he said his dozens of eyes rolled I have a call I have to ask you a question son do you have any idea what the hell you're doing out there radio is dead silent for almost 30 uncomfortable seconds as everyone waited for the young second lieutenant's response no sir Travis said Travis said but I did stay at a holiday and express last night no for those of you that aren't the military when you key up on the radio it's not like I'm just cracking a joke to my boss did just me and him no there's like dozens and dozens if not you know 40 50 maybe even 100 people that just heard you say that so that was a positive comment funny risky but kind of showed in its classic it's great because that tells the guys hey look we're going to get through this we're going to push on we're going to make this happen so I thought yeah guys from first recon shared that story when they came came to our place and it was typical Travis you know but as the hospital he said you know I just felt this this big hand coming and grabbed me and pulled me in and they were surrounded there and you know with the sniper was there firing away I don't know if you're going to share but Chuck Segal was also wounded as he came in actually got an email from Chuck recently just to you know so many years later just to sort of talk about that day and what it was all about but you can imagine that the the cloud of war chaos confusion nobody really knows what's going on as I talked to the guys that were there that day nobody was really sure where things were coming from they just knew they were in big trouble I need to know them he's gonna risk his life just to go and help them back to the book less than 24 hours later Travis's ears were ringing after an IED blew up underneath his vehicle the blast jarring pounding force loudly and abruptly halted his vehicles patrol through the city's volatile eastern industrial sector Travis had encountered IED's during his first deployment and is recently as nine days earlier after ensuring that fellow Americans and irackies were uningered Travis looked down at the sandy street where the crude explosive device was buried see that wire Travis said to another Iraqi lieutenant that's a command wire and it's stretching towards that building gathered your men and follow me he said to the Iraqi before turning to his Marines you and the other guys cover us just in case there's snipers lieutenant why don't we just leave the Iraqi said to Travis because they'll keep planning bombs around here and kill more of my men more of your men and probably kill some kids Travis said so respectfully lieutenant I'm going over there to find out who's responsible with or without you after a brief pause the Iraqi lieutenant got three of his men and followed Travis as he traced the command wires origin rounding a corner Travis saw man in civilian clothes kneeling over what appeared to be a pile of grenades which along with the attached wires appeared to be some sort of booby trap without hesitation Travis squared up to confront the threat the Marines out on the street heard the pop of Travis's M203 grenade launcher and the subsequent explosion several ran toward the sound while others stayed to keep watch over the exterior the tall sweaty insurgent took off running now being chased by a fearless determined Marine Travis had the bad guy in his sights and he wasn't going to let him get away stop Travis shouted an Arabic while pursuing the suspect by the time the US and Iraqi reinforcements arrived Travis was dragging the frightened suspect down off a wall he had tried to scale and an unsuccessful attempt unsuccessful attempt to escape after body slamming him to the ground Travis put the insurgents hands behind his back then made sure he was taken in for questioning the suspect eventually led the mid team to a room not far from the booby trap which contained grenades and many more bomb making materials without losing any lives or ruffling more feathers in the Sunni onklave Travis had helped remove deadly weapons and another terrorist from Felus' streets yeah we had in 2004 it started to come home to us at Navy you know we had J.P. Blixmith with lost in the battle of Felicia around a windchester was lost over there around the same time both football players you know and now Travis has seen your year football teams coming out with the flag and they got Ronnie and J.P.s jerseys draped over the bench you know when it was it was coming home for all of us and he had guys like Doug Zimbeck coming back from the battle of Felicia and talking about what that was all about being in the wrestling room wrestling with Travis you know was was all over and Navy yeah that's a total game changer it was definitely like that in the sealed teams too you know we went from what was it years and years since Vietnam because we had some little you know there was Panama there was Granada there was some allia there were some things that happened but those were little flashes of combat action and all the sudden we were facing what's now turned out to be you know a decade and a half or more worth a war unbelievable these guys so you know as you said they're they're I mean you know you always knew where Travis was coming from very straightforward and and I mean obviously I agree with him that's that's a lot of people don't understand and still don't a lot of people still don't understand the the positive things that were occurring over in Iraq the positive things the the simple haven't lunch with them the simple trying to prevent collateral damage you know that's been mentioned several times you know the Iraqi soldiers they get content somebody shoots at them they shoot 360 degrees they don't care where it hits and they're doing everything they can to train them and and put some discipline on them so that they don't hurt those civilians so and the willingness you know you guys tell us what to do you guys give us give us the mission and we're standing here and we'll get it in the distance one or two rooms deep you just don't know where the where the rounds are coming from and it's just very very confusing a lot of confusion from from all the guys I spoke with going back to the book here Travis and Kubicki dragged Albino out of the kilzone and closer to the vehicles front side where the sniper couldn't deliver a fatal blow to their bleeding gasping corpsmen as they tended to Albino's wounds Travis saw meringue and Seagull running toward him at full speed another piercing crack of gunfire abruptly echoed through the alley in an instant Seagull was somersaulting in midair feeling like Mike Tyson had just punched him in the stomach and landing in the middle of the bullet riddled street all around Seagull who broke his rifle wall collapsing the ground a hectic battle was unfolding in an eerie slow motion silence Seagull's wrist convulsed with tremendous pain the sniper was firing at the wounded marina's delay in the street and the young lads corporal who had just been shot in the wrist and still unbeknownst to him also in the stomach would soon be dead if he didn't get in front of that home v as Seagull laid powerless unable to do anything but wait for the crushing blow of another sniper bullet Travis pulled him out of the sniper's crosshairs moments later Seagull laid next to Albino who was still being worked on by Kubicki so again you know if you got a sniper scenario and there's a guy down the last thing you want to do is run over to try and help get him out of that situation unless you're Travis and then that's the first thing you're going to do. and I actually knew Brendan slightly because when he was a seal he went through the training that I ran out here on the west coast for the west coast seal teams and just a stud you know that's you just a stud and the one thing I one of the things I remember about him was I was not you know the the most caring and affectionate instructor as a as a when I was running that training and he you know and guys would get little you know kind of freaked out sometimes when I'd be talking to him about the decision that they were making during the training and and he would just be smiling at me like yet but you can see I mean he's a glass half full type of guy you know we're getting it done we're working hard we're going to make a difference you know that's sort of how he approached everything and that was what he was trying to share interesting thing also about the logistics role because when I was over there talking to the logistics guy that he worked with sort of in a kidding way he said you know lieutenant man he was a horrible logistics officer and they started laughing he said he's never he was always on patrol he was never there with us when we had to do logistics stuff and and I'll tell you what if you want to get some here in a mid team you know like you said you know you're going to go out patrols of the Iraqis you know you're going to have to there's no doubt about it's nothing but respect for the guys and we work with a bunch of mid teams in a body just outstanding guys doing a really really hard job Yes so when you think about section 60 and all the loss there and you know symbolically there Brendan and Travis great friends and there side by side and armington if you're ever there you know when I'm out talking to people I say you know if you don't if you haven't taken your family the armington put it on the list you're in DC or make a special trip to DC to go see armington and teach your family about that sacrifice and make sure you go to section 60 where all those heroes of today have I reckon Afghanistan or there's always something that's happening in section 60 and after that September when we moved Travis in that following spring the Navy seals found and killed those some have been ladden and then a couple weeks later the president spoke about Travis and Brendan as an example for the country in Arlington and his memorial deadress we were down there with the loonies to hear that but again their their story is a story that could be anybody story there's so many in uniform that do so much and for me writing this book is is telling their story but making sure it's part of that bigger story and the people appreciate arm men when I mean uniform and all they are and what they stand for.
