and I'm listening You know to see when a chance of me going forward what's what's the need what kind of talent that I have because I think most of us Marine Corps and different facets of society we have a place in society like I'm not a leader at all I'm a follower, but I'm a real good follower the command you know commanders intent I want to hear the commanders intent that I want to explore with the commander what that intent is I want to know what it really means Because sometimes the words don't convey what that person really thinks I want to know how I can support that person any way possible, you know what's his real meaning What's those words coming out of his mouth? They throw you over the over the deck or whatever in the water and to see if you're clustered Oh, yeah, the casual way that he said that was like oh, they just want to see if he's clustered You know what the suit that he's talking about I'm assuming it's the old school with that big ass Man like 20,000 weeks into the sea scenario You don't know say a clustered phobic uh in the bottom of the Bay Yeah, that seems like a way bigger deal than his tone was when he said it seems like not a lot of stuff was a big deal He was just jumping out of helicopters hooking in Apollo 12 going on patrol with with 30 Oh, by the way dropping danger close napa There was no team batch There was nothing I'm gonna tell you a little story you probably heard this many times So we get The pirate I don't know if you remember who Pete the pirate was I don't know his name, but I don't know So he supposedly designed the insignia for seal team right because he was drinking Budweiser one day and He'd submitted like 20 designs because they asked for T-guys and the teams to to do design now. and so they Commander their seal team says okay here's what we're gonna do we're gonna do a raid on this Nunary and we're gonna be very ugly to them when we go in and we go out So that we can protect them, you know, we're gonna act like we're gonna hook them and the kids up Yeah, because people explained it you know we had extensive training at the trade winds of What was happening and how things went down so then you got it you got you understood what's going on You know in that time it was much different than it is now because the or the navy controlled everything You were a navy asset all funding came from the navy as from not from so calm or being a national Asset like in seal team hey hey officer You know what let's hit rewind you can't do that you show up I'm you know you come to the master you come to jokk alive you roll up you got that you got that Copy a final spin and you're like I'd really like to get this sign that opened it up I'm gonna sign it. We pasteurize this when we have to add any of those chemicals look at you know it almost I almost got What's got some some guy commented on some Social maybe a thing use like all this You know just to standard he's trying up there he me trying a pitch you know some so you had no idea not a clue You didn't know it's gonna be physical you know nothing about hell week nothing You just thought you're going to a Navy school where you're gonna learn about whatever right some ran the Emolition and that type of thing diving and it would be nothing where you ran or Swam or whatever so what in your mind as you start getting Physically and mentally abused at a high level on Monday morning What made you say okay? and you know every seal team name that no demand So we start improving that camp because we know we're gonna have a lot of people laid on in that camp You know just not the 18 that we originally started with So we go to this camp and we start improving it So well I can tell you the you know the having the vehicles out there You never know when someone's gonna romp go wrong with a vehicle and to not have a good Mechanic there to ready to get those things up and running and like you said those those Homevies that we had because we got those homevies turned over up us What does it come out kind of remember 16th is when it comes out here's the thing You know the publisher saying The publisher like well, you know you're kind of a guy that might amount we either can't sign we know now Bequest so we could pick up those skills You know, but we were the last class to go into 13 so we didn't have the training that they had before that when they built the team and some of those guys I mean they had been to Vietnam like I don't know you wouldn't know tobacco alloo So he says He says now we got a lot of work for you to do we got to push all these guys out because you know the The reserves at that time weren't really we had kind of a Looser type of reserve unit and they weren't deployed that off it so some of them had ID cards that weren't current I mean there is you know You know plucking the kale from Fucking the kale from you know northern Bulgaria where it's grown without any Interference from man and then I've deemed for like you know like 38 points Probably you know, but what's it gonna be like we're just gonna be sitting you know watching victory at sea movie somewhere And not really going out and doing a lot It's weird though that someone would make that move like like like let's face it What's a good lesson alone when you're a kid that almost everybody learns don't judge a book by its cover Almost everybody Does it learns that lesson and here's a guy that double violated that number one Looking at me and judging the book by its cover and the number two straight up judge the book by its cover Straight up literally doing that and this guy's a professor Who's you know a liberal guy because I was seeing a who is this guy? right when you got done We're schooling did you go through any kind of pre-deployment workup like you know like I did my whole career was like Oh, you're getting ready to deploy you get put into a platoon So they're not gonna print enough and then people are gonna order it when it you know in on I'll know Number 14 through me like cool. And that was Jenny Posey that was Jenny yeah, by the way for those of you that are just listening to Jenny Posey was in the room You know because she did end of graduating from arm your ROTC that she was here Laffins because I could see her she was laughing at stories and and also you're still me after which never heard all these stories You know never heard all these stories about NAMM about getting thrown over the side into the into the dam bay to walk around for half an hour By the way, that's an ignorant test That's like the witch test that's like the witch test before you in the water and if you drown Then that means you're not a witch But you never know because they had the aircraft I mean excuse me the Air Force guys and C130s with the pair of guys Being able to jump out if it wasn't within because they knew once it started decelerating Coming out of the space because it had to go from 24,500 miles down to you know five miles an hour They knew upon a deceleration where it's gonna be so we would steam to that thing and it oh Oh, so if you didn't you know how you don't you know you did you got you get decayed a lot actually people don't know me Well when we were getting You know nobody wanted to come home at least most of the guys didn't want to come home because People didn't like you if you're a New York services if you had a haircut Like the most of us in this room they perceived you to be a soldier or a sailor and they didn't like you They had drop us off in the jungle and we'd put patrol through the jungle because they weren't expecting us you know at that time That was right after Tet so Tet and the United States was very demoralizing because Army always said you know we have this we have this sector we have this country we're doing Better every day and then Tet happens this massive battle and We beat them back of course, but a lot especially the Marines up north really took a beating and And after that as far as the people here in America I think we're that that was the end of Vietnam And so I really I like that because I mean these guys were slow and they had no ability to engage the enemy I mean we had 30 guys and if there were six guys engaging us, you know, they were freaking out You know Hi And with that War and Officer Bill Posey has left the building Some good stuff Man about how to Be a good frog man and how to be a good human A guy that's Been in the game and stayed in the game right stayed in the game 56 years old row and now on ops get It's funny to hear like everyone else or everyone's take on things you know you have various guests Jura Dally here so I always try to defer that or push it back to my boss Because that's what makes you valuable and if you need a favor some time those people will come Forward and I learned that and Vietnam When we would go to these different places They would leave like flags and pictures of Different things and China and pottery Then we were able to take those assets to the guys that were on the navy bases and if we needed You know cases see rats at the time or Would you guys mind you're unloading all this beer out of this ship and Would you guys mind pushing a pallet of this beer off the dock and let it fall into the water We're gonna turn around and we're gonna do a five and five on you I said really I said you got this you know I said okay It's what's gonna do So what do we got and what do we have them for we got them for your joints for your mind for your body and For your muscles directly joint warfare Don't worry work for your oil super krill oil These are for your joints like okay, and this is gonna be a big deal Because if your joints failure you can be strong You can be strong you can be capable you can run everyday you're joined start failing you start bothering you Whatever good is it having a 454 big block a Yes, so you kind of like if he don't know he just decayed You know decayed means no, didn't know We just we would we actually thought that vehicles It was kind of a joke in the seal teams if you got inserted by a vehicle We'd call it a he-lo truck right meaning hey, we're just pretending this is a helicopter We don't really have one we didn't realize like this is gonna be our primary mode of transportation is gonna be the home V not even the D p v's or any of these high speed vehicles for a solid three years there in the middle It was a home v and that was it. and we had we relied on the guys Coming from seal team to UDT because there were so many new people and so many I mean everybody was an E3 right because They expanded the teams and Same with the boat guys and There was no time for training and they just wanted to get you to work because there was 500,000 Americans and Vietnam at the time So you had to go over there and take the next teams, you know a place. so but it was good to get the Reservist back in to that line of fire so that they could you know Because you know you gotta get it on you know we know like this is when you're in Iraq I'm getting ready to deploy Iraq we know that we're going to take those guys place right You know this is this is what's really happening You know think you know my objective read right be able to present your stealth They're gonna put the second edition and there's no this is not a Redemable situation you know you make some decisions in life you can never go back from like you get a tattoo on your forehead seem like a good idea right, but you can't go back from that No, it happened there was for it in the old cement people who don't know about seal team don't know about that old Sement building it was I don't know if they've tore that down or not they tore everything down here He's gonna you know he he doesn't have all this teeth, but you know, but you know it's always in the sea too but anyhow I have my own vehicle because I'm the like the The go to guy to get things done for whatever you know little things you know somebody's got this or they need that or whatever and let's say even you don't exist He has a point That guy saying oh, it's just like everything you know it's like everyone everything else or whatever, you know We did a lot of patrolling and you know Try to do some DA and stuff like that, you know, so what one of these operations like? We got on two DC sixes and we had chopped Hawaii Johnson Island You know going over so three-day airplane ride Mm-hmm and because we just went from island to island and finally made it to PI which was our main Mustering base and then we were dispatched to where we were gonna go and from Vietnam from there But prior to prior to going on that getting on that plane with the rest of the team did you go to Desert warfare training did you go to did you guys train over the beach? Right hey, we're not supposed to your tell us about what was like if you know I'm hold on a second I'm gonna talk about a new whatever right after these messages So he was really good to me for whatever reason so One last question about Buds when when you're showing up you don't know anything that's about to take place Seems like guys now they know kind of the minute by minute schedule. Is there any Part of your brain that thinks maybe you're gonna you know retire and sit on the front porch and Drink coffee in the morning and watch the grass grow you know the problem is I really hate old people I hate old people I don't think you want to Commander I just have this little we do we talk politics every morning from 630 to 7 on 95.9 on no radio Victoria Texas and We talk about things that are going on and especially things that are going on on the Republican party and How we can you know fight back from what we think has Not been well for us in the past here especially the past couple years and how old are you right now? You know You got to do what you got to do so you know that was really a good thing and You know you're not gonna run and gun like These studgy dudes right here, right? and you make a fool of yourself What's worse in there nothing nothing nothing You know it's like you know especially with a billion people watching That's the one thing that's worth is having a billion people watching be In confident when you're supposed to be competent. So the rest of the process and they said whatever you do whatever you do You do not go and strip the foil off the capsule because they want to analyze its Capitals like a fiberglass aircraft aluminum right and All over the if they have this gold foil this plastic gold foil Do not take any of the foil because we have to analyze a situation when it comes out of the spit out of the out of the Air we need to know what's going on No, we were the poor man sealed So no stoners I'm just going to talk about the M16 if you don't mind commander You know that we got to Vietnam we used a variety of different weapons here in training in San Diego And none I don't remember any M16s that we used here so we get there and they give us the M16 See man, this is so much different from those woodstock very very heavy weapons We had you know Because I tell you know the problem at least my perception I'm probably speaking out of turn, but the problem is they treat the kids like kids You know how many in world war two even in Vietnam You had these guys. and We know what was awesome was it didn't take very long Like you said the seal teams not only do we not have vehicles But prior to this we didn't have any vehicle procedures either we didn't know anything and You would take the lead line see how deep it went and write it on your slate You know position number one 50 feet position well you never went over 18 feet You know that was 18 to zero was what you're looking at in hydrographic Consence then you would take all the sleets once you got done with your beach and you'd go back to the ship So you got to do a good job Because it could be devastating them coming right up you know right up on you would most of your patrol How many guys would you take out on those standard patrol usually eight to ten? You know I've got some some Vietnam friends that that weren't in the seal teams sometimes They'd say they barely got in any contact with the enemy other guys different deployments They got in contact even Roger Hayden from one deployment to the next one time He's out there. and he had to screen in front of the door You'd walk in the door see this one guy sitting at the bar you would immediately go down it around the screen go out Because you know there is gonna be a fight in like 15 minutes, right? So they were right there, you know with the 50s and the 60s and stuff and letting them have it Where we would be hiding behind it with our M16 point it out from the side We're okay, we're gonna we're gonna get those Vc today. Oh, I thought you got injured you came home because you heard now, but I was hurt, but it didn't bother me I mean the bottom I don't know for whatever reason the bottoms my feet were killing me, but that you know what can you do? We would do too great with the press I know I made her stay in the house and the kid walked me out God because I we were trying to be very cognizant of that You know, but we didn't want to leave a trail that they would have problems for sure If it looked like they were helping coalition forces that's a deathson.
