[00:00:00] This is Jockel Pondcast number 216 with echo Charles and me, a Jockel Willick. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:09] In attack, most daring, in defense, most cunning, in endurance, most steadfast. They performed
[00:00:19] a few of arms which will be remembered and recounted as long as the virtues of courage and resolution
[00:00:28] have the power to move the hearts of men. And that right there is Winston Churchill speaking
[00:00:40] in honor of the British First Airborne Division at honor and him. He was actually making that
[00:00:49] statement on September 22nd, 1944 in which the battle was not actually even over yet. And we did
[00:00:59] cover that faithful battle on podcast 94 from the book called Medit R. N. by Jeffrey Powell
[00:01:09] and it's just an incredible book and an account of the British Airborne Division in that battle
[00:01:19] where they lost almost 75% of its strength. And from that point on was for all practical purposes
[00:01:31] out of the war. So who were these men that made this stand? We saw one when we covered Jeffrey
[00:01:42] Powell's book, but obviously there were thousands more each one of hero and also each one a
[00:01:54] a human being. And I recently got a book in the mail that someone sent me. The book was written
[00:02:04] by one such man, one such human being. The book is called The Memory In Durs and it was written by
[00:02:12] a man named Reg Curtis. So let's go to this book and meet and learn and honor a hero of a human being.
[00:02:31] Here we go. Chapter one's called Pray Loot to War as a youth I carried out milk. I carried
[00:02:38] out a milk ground in the early morning and a newspaper around in the evening, earning four
[00:02:43] shillings a week, which helped towards the cost of the special clothing I needed as a choir boy
[00:02:49] at St Augustine's Church near Grove Park Railway Station. When I left school in 1934 at the age of
[00:02:57] 14, I got a job at Elliott Brothers and Electrical and Mechanical Engineers firm in Lusham.
[00:03:04] I cycled five miles to and from work Monday to Saturday and learned quickly under the
[00:03:10] washful eye of the charge hand learning how to operate a milling machine, center lathe, hydraulic
[00:03:17] press and finally working as a captain, a center operator. I had to just read that part because
[00:03:25] you know you always hear about the old man who had to go five miles to work in five mile home
[00:03:30] uphill both ways. There you go. There you go. Redg Curtis was doing it. After three years I was
[00:03:39] beginning to set and by the way he's like 14 years old at this time just a kind of FYI. So
[00:03:46] after three years I was beginning to settle in for a long-term job when a series of small
[00:03:51] strikes put the damper on my enthusiasm. The persistent industrial action prompted my decision
[00:04:00] to join the army where such strikes were not tolerated. You kind of get the impression this is
[00:04:06] odd guy, right? He's there having strikes whatever he says where where where can I go where that's
[00:04:12] not going to happen. Oh I know the army. My father had been in the Royal Army Service Corps and my
[00:04:18] grandfather was the chairman of the Royal British Legion so the army seemed natural enough in my
[00:04:23] family. I was encouraged by my uncle Fred himself a regimental sergeant major. I chose the footguards
[00:04:30] because after a short-term of service I would be acceptable to the city of London police. In those
[00:04:35] days you had to be at least five and five feet ten and a half inches tall to be a policeman.
[00:04:41] I was already six one and still growing. I presented myself to the guards recruiting office in London
[00:04:47] and enlisted with the first or grenadier regiment of the footguards. And flowing forward a little bit
[00:04:55] that there was one corporal Tucker. So now he's you know going through the boot camp scenario.
[00:05:02] There was one corporal Tucker. My squad instructor who took great delight in marching us on
[00:05:08] to the frozen parade ground with extra zest. Then put us on a charge if we slipped up.
[00:05:15] So you not only received a sore rump but also got extra parade as punishment. Another approach
[00:05:21] was to march us toward a large puddle and then give the order to mark time. Come on knees higher.
[00:05:26] He would shout from a safe distance, scrutinizing each man and turn and looking for any signs of cracking.
[00:05:34] We were just numbers at Caterham.
[00:05:38] Though this day I say it did me no harm as it instilled a self-discipline that has served me well
[00:05:45] through life. That's what you're going to get. And you know you and I were talking earlier about
[00:05:50] basically normal face. Basically look I'm not going to show that this is not fun. I'm not going
[00:05:57] to show. And you were saying that you learn if you say look no factor right? No factor. I got to do
[00:06:06] this hard thing. No factor. Not hey I got to do this hard thing so I'm going to get mentally
[00:06:10] all fired up. No no just no factor. And you learn over time that saying no factor keeping it in your
[00:06:17] head actually you get better at it. And all of a sudden hard things you just go I'm just going to do it.
[00:06:23] I'm just going to attack it. That's one of the things that this type of military training does.
[00:06:29] And even he's saying look the stuff that this guy's going to go through is a thousand times harder
[00:06:35] than doing mark time march on the parade ground for an hour. Thousands of times harder infinitely
[00:06:40] harder. But there's a little less in that he learned. And plus he's British right? And the Brits
[00:06:48] with the stiff upper lip that's that's like a whole culture at least it used to be because the
[00:06:54] culture's changed a lot and Britain but this warrior culture of hey they're literally England
[00:07:00] if you think about it the stiff upper lip which is hey we're just going to go do that's that's the
[00:07:05] no factor culture of hey we got something to do cool we're going to go do it watch this with this is
[00:07:11] England what do we got we got some hard for us cool no factor step up or let move forward.
[00:07:19] Fast for in a little bit so he gets like one of his first jobs is is sort of
[00:07:25] guarding the the royal family and so he does some of that and then moves on to kind of the regular
[00:07:33] army going back to look soon enough I left the glamour of Windsor and the comfort of
[00:07:39] Victoria Barracks behind it was sent to pair bright in Surrey where every guard's men goes
[00:07:45] for field work craft and firing on the open range it was my duty to be able to handle and fire
[00:07:51] a gun in preparation to protect King and Country in an emergency but trust my luck to a fallen
[00:07:57] fall and fall of bad weather it was not really my cup of tea to prostrate myself on a wet
[00:08:04] and windstrip flying right range with a sergeant breathing down my neck whispering words of encouragement
[00:08:09] and added supply of rainwater running over me in torrents from his ground sheet cape
[00:08:16] this is this is not the way you'd hear a US Marine described.
[00:08:21] Being on the range in a rainy day you know that's such a British way of explaining this and then
[00:08:27] he continues on it must have done some good as I made first class shot though for what purpose I was not yet
[00:08:33] sure so guess what this is supposed to world war one I think I want to say this is 1939 when he
[00:08:38] enlisted so there's maybe 30 maybe 38 actually I think it's 37 yeah 1937 he joined the army
[00:08:44] so there's you know world war one was what 20 years in the past that was the war to end all wars
[00:08:52] sure there's a guy in Germany that might begin a little up at he but he's saying hey look I
[00:08:57] know I gotta learn how to use this gun but not really sure what I need to know how to do this for
[00:09:04] continuing on fast-forward a little bit in early in 1939 I was transferred to the home of the
[00:09:09] British Army at Aldershot in Hampshire I'll never forget the atmosphere of the night of the tattoo
[00:09:15] which tattoo is like a word for a parade basically when our battalion marched on dressed in navy blue
[00:09:22] trousers with red piping down the out seam outside out seam of each trouser leg long-sleeved
[00:09:29] white wader type jackets with brass buttons and the guards peaked cap with red band around the crown
[00:09:34] carried out without a word of command our drilled display lasted for 20 minutes the finale being
[00:09:40] the only time a command was given the battalion will advance in review order by the entire by the
[00:09:46] center quick march 450 men moved his one and the reason I had that once again when you just think
[00:09:54] about human beings right psychologically in that moment look you're a cog in the wheel that's all you
[00:10:03] are you're a pawn on the chessboard that's all you are but and he and he says it
[00:10:11] like that feeling that you get of being a part of something that's literally bigger than you are
[00:10:19] hey I'm just I'm just a guy out here in a uniform but there's 450 of us moving as one
[00:10:25] and there's some part of human instinct that likes to be a part of that tribe
[00:10:31] ummm continue on in August some mysterious goings on began unusual apparatus in the form of
[00:10:41] digging equipment both powered and hand operated appeared along with wheel barrels and mountains of
[00:10:46] little sacks which turned out to be sandbags lorries loaded this lorries loaded with sand
[00:10:52] would dump their contents at various points and instead of the usual drill parades and kit inspections
[00:10:56] we found ourselves filling these bags with sand and building barriers I thought it must be some
[00:11:01] sort of giant exercise and had no idea that it was in preparation for real enemy
[00:11:07] being confined to the barracks with its own shops and theater we didn't mix with the public
[00:11:13] so new very little ball matters of national importance indeed in those days the serviceman was
[00:11:18] not allowed to discuss politics and we would put on charge if caught attending a political meeting
[00:11:23] so these guys are completely isolated and I'm thinking about even when I joined the navy and
[00:11:29] we go on a ship we didn't know idea what's going on there's no internet yet and so we had no
[00:11:34] idea what was going on in the outside world and even even living on base I mean you at least
[00:11:40] when even when I joined you had key cable news right you knew that the CNN was on and you're watching
[00:11:46] CNN and you're knowing what's going on in the world there's no CNN there's no TV there's nothing
[00:11:53] so these guys are completely isolated they're living the all the stores are going to are on base
[00:11:57] the theaters on base so there's living on base paying no mind to what's going on overseas
[00:12:02] what does put on charge means getting trouble just in general yeah just in general like oh he
[00:12:07] got in trouble yeah okay so it's not like a you know because it's varying levels of you
[00:12:12] you're trying to any covers and he I'm glad you brought that up because it's he uses it throughout
[00:12:17] kind of the book because there's you get you can get one on charge for all kinds of stuff yeah
[00:12:21] and so it's just a general term that means being in trouble maybe written up maybe sent to the
[00:12:28] brig for a little time whatever but you know you got put on charge yeah no court martial
[00:12:32] nothing like this but could be you keep it up yeah if you well it could be too you like if you
[00:12:37] did something really bad you just got okay you know he's gonna get put on charge okay yeah I got
[00:12:41] you and yes is any level of trouble is what I perceive to this maybe a brick military
[00:12:46] person will let us know if I'm wrong continue on on the third of September war was declared
[00:12:55] with Germany and I realized what all the sandbagging was for within days my battalion was mobilized
[00:13:03] reservists were called up and along with thousands of other troops two weeks later two weeks
[00:13:09] later we were in France I think I was quite unperturbed at the possibility of getting killed after
[00:13:17] all I was a soldier trained to kill so why should I have any qualms you know what's nuts about this
[00:13:24] and I mean putting into perspective world war one which was now 20 years at hindsight was so
[00:13:30] insanely savage and yet this guy still regges like yeah you know what cool I'm not worried about
[00:13:41] getting killed I'm a soldier and you think about the casualties in World War one had to be
[00:13:49] had you had to beat it shows you it shows you how quickly we can forget right what war is
[00:13:57] because if you witnessed a day on the battlefield and World War one there's no way you'd want to do
[00:14:02] any of that ever again but whatever your 20 years old you're crack shot with that rifle
[00:14:13] time to go get some continue on in the forward positions we oh yeah and by the way now I'm just
[00:14:18] jumping past hey they get there and by the way like I said they get to France two weeks later
[00:14:23] this isn't like okay we're doing a prolonged preparation no we're declaring war on the third
[00:14:29] and in September the third of September we're declaring war and then in September two weeks later
[00:14:36] you're on the ground in France ready to get some in the forward positions so now they they start
[00:14:42] moving forward from France in the forward positions we took over deserted village called
[00:14:47] Tromborn about six miles from the German border as it was snowing our fighting patrol decided
[00:14:51] to make use of sheets to create so they're in these areas that are pretty much abandoned
[00:14:56] and so they're going into houses and finding stuff as it was snowing our fighting patrol decided
[00:15:00] to make use of sheets to create sets of camouflage gear white suits gloves over boots hats and
[00:15:05] coverings for rifles hunting around we've I found a sewing machine thinking that we might as well
[00:15:10] do things the easy way as a fighting patrol we didn't fire a shot there's more matter of
[00:15:16] listening and night reconnaissance in our white outfits carrying only rifles and are
[00:15:20] limited other gear we traveled more comfortably than we had previously which I skipped over the
[00:15:25] part where they're basically doing long long movements to get into positions on one night reconnaissance
[00:15:32] we became over confident don't what that happened and one of our lads knocked up against the enemy
[00:15:38] wire it was a still bright moonlit night we were in no man's land just 75 feet from the forward
[00:15:45] German positions they're talking of stop to abruptly as luck would have it we were crawling so we
[00:15:51] froze hugging the ground for an hour without moving on another occasion we were on our way back
[00:15:57] to base when from and by the way on that one they they make it out on another occasion we were on
[00:16:03] our way back to base when from the direction of a bend in the road 50 yards away we saw a group of
[00:16:07] figures we were about two miles from our lines and knew that no other patrols were out so these
[00:16:12] men must be the enemy our patrol leader gave the signal a lie still we were straddled each side of the
[00:16:17] road in semi-open ground but fortunately the night was not too bright the group passed by
[00:16:23] ten men in all spaced six to eight feet apart they were well-armed but war no white suits
[00:16:29] keeping them in view and moving only our eyes we lay unnoticed if we had been spotted they would have
[00:16:35] had the advantage because of their automatic weapons and also the fact that they as they passed
[00:16:41] down our center we could not have fired on them for fear of hitting our own men never separate your
[00:16:48] forces which is hard when you're walking down a road because when you're walking down a road you're
[00:16:52] going to be in a what's called a staggered file which means you got guys on either side of the road
[00:16:56] right which generally we're trying to stay off the roads anyways but sometimes that road is the
[00:17:01] smartest place to move you're going to make a bunch of noise moving through the brush and you can
[00:17:04] get on that road and move really quietly so it's something that can happen but then when they see
[00:17:08] the enemy they all get off the road what's the quickest way to get off the road it's on the
[00:17:12] room side that you're on and what does that mean you're on both sides of the road now in the
[00:17:16] enemy walks in between you and you start shooting at the enemy you're actually shooting each other
[00:17:22] so you have to be cognizant of that which these guys were continuing on when I came into contact
[00:17:32] with two Germans and this is another thing about this book the first of all this book is not
[00:17:36] very long but the other thing that's that's crazy and British and no factor and stuff up a lip
[00:17:42] is he'll he'll describe the most insane things that were factually crazy as like in three sentences
[00:17:51] of what and just really matter a fact you know so although there are times where he
[00:17:58] definitely adds some color but that's the way he is just just kind of matter fact very British about
[00:18:04] the whole thing when I came into contact with the two Germans for the first time myself I gave them
[00:18:09] five rounds of rapid fire to range of 50 yards as they edge towards me under the cover of garden
[00:18:14] walls and fencing they were my first shots in anger I didn't see the two Germans anymore so maybe
[00:18:19] they were lucky shots guardsman baitman and Elm's doubled past and shattered for me to come
[00:18:26] on and we continued into open country making our way over to a bridge and halting roughly after
[00:18:30] roughly a thousand yards where we took up defensive positions air activity was increasingly
[00:18:37] tremendous measurement one-on-ones were machine gunning at low level and had strafed our troops
[00:18:43] coming over the bridge only a few minutes after I crossed there's these these talking about these
[00:18:51] and I I don't know if I just never really thought about it this much detail but he talks about these
[00:18:58] you know the enemy aircraft coming in at low level and strafing them all the time and if you
[00:19:04] were seeing a measure Schmidt they're just really bad ass looking aircraft and a lot of the
[00:19:10] German aircraft they just were I mean all the aircraft back then right I mean you got spit fires you
[00:19:15] got corsairs you got mustang you got a p-38 line but you got awesome looking aircraft that and if you
[00:19:21] can imagine this too at that time those were the most technologically advanced things right
[00:19:28] so they didn't look they didn't look old right they looked like a x-wing fighter from star wars
[00:19:36] right that's what you were seeing you were seeing this magical machine that was just
[00:19:41] and now this thing is pointing at you at an altitude of like 300 or 400 feet and just dumping
[00:19:49] machine gun rounds at you and can you imagine the noise that they make with those big giant engines I mean
[00:19:55] yeah and so he talks about that a lot in these books and that's kind of the first encounter that
[00:20:03] he brings it up the other thing that scares me about it is it's sort of random you know it's
[00:20:08] almost like mortar fire because the aircraft's gonna come down if it's pointed two degrees in
[00:20:13] that direction you're fine if it points two degrees in your direction your dead and the rounds are
[00:20:18] hitting you know at a spacing of six feet or whatever when they get through ground so if you're
[00:20:24] in between those two six feet you're totally fine or you get hitting the face or in the head
[00:20:29] and you're dead so there's this element of chance going on as well which I never like
[00:20:36] I never liked that element of chance continuing on leaving the area and traveling mainly on foot
[00:20:43] encountering few enemy on the ground but experiencing continuous shelling and bombing from the air
[00:20:48] we came to a stop by the river Asuka near the city of Tornai six miles from the French border
[00:20:56] here we went into a counterattack during which a very well-liked platoon commander Lutenette the Duke
[00:21:03] of Northumberland was killed Lance Corporal Harry Nichols and guardsmen Nash were ordered to
[00:21:09] flush out some bothersome machine gun as 600 yards from our position that's British right you're
[00:21:15] going to describe machine gun as as bothersome the section I was in gave covering fire
[00:21:24] what what what what is that all about yeah that's called cover move fundamental to our left
[00:21:29] they picked their way with caution Nichols and a light machine gun under each arm
[00:21:33] Nichols with a light machine gun under each arm I didn't see them anymore but they must have
[00:21:38] completed the mission because there were because the enemy fire ceased after a while Lance
[00:21:42] Corporal Nichols was posted missing presumed killed but later reported as being alive in enemy hands
[00:21:48] he was awarded the Victoria Cross for this action in the semi-built up area on the river the
[00:21:54] Germans afforded very good target practice for me I found that I just could not miss but we were all
[00:22:01] getting weary through lack of sleep and proper food no one can live off scraps or from scavenging
[00:22:05] for long without feeling the worst for it and enemy numbers were increasing tenfold or so it seemed
[00:22:13] continuing on we came to another stop this was the last time I took part in a coordinated attack
[00:22:18] with the third battalion grendendier guards we went into a bayonet charge
[00:22:26] I say again we went into a bayonet charge at court to cure
[00:22:30] setting off I felt very scared and all sorts of things went through my mind like what the hell
[00:22:38] am I doing here oh yes I joined the army to become a policeman want a laugh the muck was flying fast
[00:22:46] bullets winding and splattering and I crouch lower to dodge them all I went with the rest my 16
[00:22:54] inch and field bayonet blade fixed and protruding at the ready ready ready for what the only thing I
[00:23:00] had ever stuck with a bayonet was a sack dummy then I saw them in the swirling smoke human beings
[00:23:07] not sacks real Germans blimey I trouched on wrenching my ankle in a pot hole on and on until the
[00:23:15] order rang out charge charge I began to double now with my bayonet thrust at full on guard
[00:23:25] those figures growing bigger and bigger until they were just a few yards away among the din
[00:23:31] and yells of pain there were dead bodies from both sides littering my approach I was a foot from
[00:23:37] the two Germans went suddenly they both dropped their rifles and reached very high chattering
[00:23:43] something about comrad I was so bloody amazed and relieved that I said come on then I'll take you
[00:23:50] prisoner which is just that paragraph for me to think through because I'm thinking when I see
[00:23:58] those Germans you know what I'm doing I'm shooting them right I'm not going to continue with the
[00:24:03] bayonet charge right I'm not expecting to take these guys prisoner my battalion was now badly
[00:24:14] cut up and he used the term cut up meaning shot up meaning wounded injured he used that throughout
[00:24:19] the book with numbers well below effective fighting power and we were ordered to attach ourselves to
[00:24:25] any unit and make our way to done Kirk though no reason was given and here I was stuck with two
[00:24:32] German prisoners the journey was nerve-racking with hordes of refugees jamming the roads and making
[00:24:36] military transport movement almost impossible lorries guns in French aged 39 hotchkes tanks were
[00:24:42] off and seen abandoned inditches rendered imoval but clearly not by enemy action what was going on
[00:24:51] were we throwing in the towel so he's seen all these abandoned vehicles and they're being destroyed
[00:24:56] by friendly forces only because we don't want the enemy to get ahold of our tanks and he's
[00:25:02] trying to figure out what's going on and obviously anyone that knows anything about history knows
[00:25:05] that they're heading for done Kirk to leave the route was an absolute shambles with military
[00:25:12] and civilian gear constantly getting estranged rumors were plentiful now such as the story
[00:25:17] that leapled third of geard of Belgium and his army were capitulating towns all over France were falling
[00:25:24] into enemy hands French general jiraud had been taken prisoner to pile on the agony the
[00:25:30] Germans not lit up on their bombing or machine gunning one bit and their slaughter of refugees was
[00:25:34] unnecessary and sickening to see we did what we could in the way of tending to civilian wounded
[00:25:41] using their own clothing or bedding for bandages while their dead were either left covered
[00:25:46] left or covered with something to hide their torn bodies and agonized faces even cattle grazing
[00:25:52] in the fields had not escaped the bullets Craig and lay bloated through lack of milking or blown
[00:25:57] apart by shell fire the carnage spread for a good two miles after seeing those poor
[00:26:03] wretched civilian so caught up my occasional wounded soldier the occasional wounded soldier did
[00:26:09] not seem quite so bad my two German prisoners appeared to be as disgusted by all of this as I was
[00:26:17] and you're gonna see throughout this book the impression that he gets of the German as you
[00:26:21] could see that there's definitely a wide range of Germans that they encounter obviously some
[00:26:30] completely hostile but there's some that clearly are not are not totally engaged in the Nazi
[00:26:39] attitude and there's plenty there's it's very interesting to hear as he interacts with people throughout it
[00:26:46] continue on we reach the outskirts of Dunkirk to find a mass build up a French and British
[00:26:50] soldiers with transport tanks and artillery pieces jamming the roads like a London rush hour
[00:26:56] the next five days were a mixture of hell, hunger and fatigue and I think it was only thanks to
[00:27:02] the fatigue that I overcame the hell and the hunger I know it was five days because I put a
[00:27:08] nick in my rifle butt each morning when roused by this visiting stucco's and mishrschmits so they're
[00:27:14] getting bombed and they're getting machine gunned every morning during daylight the appointed beach
[00:27:19] master a British officer mustard officers and NCOs from all regiments and brief them to organize
[00:27:24] parties of men to tend to wounded bury the dead and scavenge for ammunition and food I found it most
[00:27:31] distasteful removing tins of bully beef and biscuit remains from corpses but at least I still had my life
[00:27:39] the beach was littered with abandoned lorries and trucks as well as army staff cars with wheels
[00:27:44] missing and doors hanging off as I wandered around going about my task among these mutilated
[00:27:49] forms that were once carefree young men I remember thinking that I must be dreaming
[00:27:57] I was brought back to reality sharply by the appearance of two enemy fighter plans which proceeded
[00:28:03] to distribute even more death in panic I dived over a corpse and slithered down a sand dune
[00:28:08] the staring eyes of the corpse saying to me get your head down and rs up after five days on the
[00:28:21] beaches it was a relief to find that it was finally my turn to get into the snake like line
[00:28:25] of troops ready for departure as I drew closer to the vast mass of a ship a mine sweeper
[00:28:33] heaving in the mucky looking swell I could see it's multi-barrel attack gun porting skyward
[00:28:39] in readiness for any stucophyters or attack or fighter attack the operator seeming oblivious to
[00:28:44] our presence one was scanning the sky with his binoculars the water was by now was well and truly
[00:28:49] up to my neck and I still had 50 feet to go I clung the rope with both hands and pushed on
[00:28:54] the man behind gave me a shove the water kept lapping over my nose and into my eyes
[00:28:59] gulping choking and spitting out the endless mouthfuls of oily, foul tasting salt water I was
[00:29:05] now quite submerged with a last mighty effort I lunched in the direction of the boat still
[00:29:11] grasping at that rope I could not have been it could not have been more than a minute that I was
[00:29:16] underwater but it felt like a lifetime clinging on tight to the rope with my left hand with my
[00:29:21] right I grew up through the rope mesh hanging down the side of the ship and with great exaltation
[00:29:26] found and grabbed it I managed to pull myself up up up and up the ship rocking and heaving with
[00:29:33] each vibration of the exploding bombs which were arriving much too close for my liking
[00:29:40] so finally he's on board a ship and they're getting bombed and strafed flopping down
[00:29:44] exhausted I was soon asleep though inevitably we had a visitor visit from a meshishment
[00:29:48] and this woke me violently as its bullets danced along the ship's deck causing large pieces
[00:29:53] of wood splinters to spew over everyone these administrators as much damage as the bullets to some
[00:29:59] unfortunate recipients I dosed off again and slept like a log until we docked in England
[00:30:08] so ended my participation with more than 300,000 others in operation dynamo better known as the
[00:30:14] history better known history as the miracle of Dunkirk so that's the way you kick things off
[00:30:21] with your with your war and I forget the time that passed and I know that the time that
[00:30:27] seemed to pass was very quick the way I just read it skipping a bunch of stuff but it was like
[00:30:32] 200 days that he was on the ground this was no hey I was there for a week no they were there
[00:30:37] moving forward fighting drawing back going on tack back and forth this whole time and you know that
[00:30:44] could be you know just that experience right there could be a whole book and it yeah on into itself
[00:30:50] right that's how that's how low key red skirt is is you know he was literally
[00:30:56] extracted off of Dunkirk after this entire campaign falls apart and he covers it in 20 pages
[00:31:05] not even 20 pages because he's getting warmed up so he gets home and he says they're followed
[00:31:17] two weeks of leave that I enjoyed more than ever before the sheer ecstasy of white sheets and
[00:31:23] pint after pint of beautiful beer and the days of roughing it in France seemed soon
[00:31:31] seemed very long ago yeah can you gotta you gotta think how hard it's like when you're going
[00:31:37] through basic seal training mm-hmm what they do is they I don't know how weak you've been awake
[00:31:42] for like two or three days and then they go hey they come up with this big story and they tell you
[00:31:47] that oh you're gonna we've we've kept you we were too hard on you guys we we have the the
[00:31:52] commanding officer just told us we got to we got to put you guys to sleep for eight hours so go get
[00:31:56] warm dry clothes on and we'll come back to you guys and we'll wake you up in eight hours and you're
[00:32:01] of course you believe it I mean back in the day we believed because we didn't know any better no
[00:32:04] one gave us any heads up there was no in for intel network providing information there wasn't
[00:32:10] there wasn't like the movies about the stuff right so we just thought oh wow that seems
[00:32:15] kind of crazy but okay and then you get all dressed nice warm clothes and you're all dry and you go
[00:32:21] even go literally get in your bed and then as soon as you fall asleep like 20 minutes goes by
[00:32:26] and they're in there with machine guns and bull horns and they're waking you up so when you think
[00:32:31] about that's that's retiny right that's a tiny tiny little thing when you compare to what's going
[00:32:37] on here this guy goes to France starving like wounded and dead everywhere fear gets back to England
[00:32:45] goes on leave for two weeks white sheets you know beer it's all good and then you know what's
[00:32:56] gonna happen you're gonna go back so when you when they did that to you uh in was that hell
[00:33:03] week and they did okay so before there was before there was like a network right I say
[00:33:10] that and you said you believed it like one they say oh we put you right was there a part of
[00:33:14] you mine like or as far as part of the reason why you believed it it's because like they are pushing
[00:33:20] you pretty hard at any point were you like hey they're pushing us too hard yeah actually I
[00:33:25] thought what you're gonna say is was there part of my mom and this would have been I would
[00:33:29] said yes was there part of my mind was like this is too good to be true this is nothing that's
[00:33:33] you know that that I would say the bigger part of my mind was saying that but I kind of was like
[00:33:37] oh I seems like a cool like they're they're telling us this right but no no before that though
[00:33:43] like at any point where they like I know hell or were you or whoever being like I know how
[00:33:48] weeks supposed to be hard but like this is kind of excessive like yeah I had no data on which to
[00:33:54] judge it right you know it's gonna be hard you know soccer no guy that quit buds and I said you know
[00:34:00] like why did you quit and he said because it sucked you know I said well didn't you know that
[00:34:05] it was gonna suck when you went there I mean that's where you're going like we all know it sucks
[00:34:10] go watch it a video you know and it's like it's gonna be it's gonna suck it's gonna be cold
[00:34:15] it's gonna be wet it's gonna be miserable it just feels like that yeah it's gonna suck like that
[00:34:21] part but then you know like it goes sometimes in your brain anyway it'll go beyond sucked into like
[00:34:26] whether be dangerous I never felt like that no I was always like all this is this is just the
[00:34:31] training right okay then yeah then that makes sense that you could go to when they say oh yeah
[00:34:36] here's a eight hour sleeper whatever you could go to well this might be too good to be true yeah like
[00:34:40] oh yeah so I'm saying what you're saying is you're sure that there's guys that were like yeah that's right
[00:34:43] yeah man of course way too hard and then those are the guys that when they get when the trick
[00:34:48] comes they get trapped brother devastated yeah devastated mentally devastated that's why it's one of the
[00:34:53] best things well not a lot you know there's a lot of people that don't get out of that bed
[00:34:57] right they don't get out of that bed because as soon as you get out you're going straight to the
[00:35:02] surf zone and people don't like that man I mean you can hear seals talk about it guys can
[00:35:08] get scarred from liking the ocean for years man for years they they don't want to go in the water
[00:35:15] they don't want to do it because because they just they use it as an implementive torture
[00:35:21] me I didn't care you know like I surfed and it was all good you know let's go get some sort of
[00:35:28] how back to the book so he's home he's taking a little time off he goes back and starts doing
[00:35:39] kind of local let's call it like local guard type activities and then we get this in August I
[00:35:46] received a telegram telling me that my home in south London had been hit by a sea mine and I was
[00:35:51] given compassionate leave to return what the hell was a sea mine doing inland it must be a mistake I
[00:35:58] thought however apparently there was such a thing which came down attached to a parachute so that's what
[00:36:03] the Nazis were doing and so he gets little leave to go and check things out and so he goes and here we
[00:36:12] go this is him finding his home upon reaching Grove Park as I turned into fairfield road I immediately saw
[00:36:17] that our house had received a direct hit there is now just a heap of debris where once it stood
[00:36:22] half a dozen houses and dozens more were badly damaged the local ARP warden told me that not one
[00:36:28] person had been killed because everyone had taken to their Anderson air raid shelters my parents were
[00:36:33] both okay and staying with some friends of mile of the road it was a shock to see our home destroyed
[00:36:38] but after all I had seen in France I think I must have become immune to any real emotions
[00:36:46] and then this happens in October as a result of a directive sent out by our prime minister
[00:36:52] Winston Churchill we received a letter which was read out to us by the regimental sergeant major
[00:36:58] volunteers he shouted for a new type of fighting soldier are required he glanced over the top of the
[00:37:06] paper BDI's registering some amusement soldiers he carried on to be trained as commandos and
[00:37:14] parachutists now I know that you would not wish to desert the regiment but anyone wishing to volunteer
[00:37:22] one-paced forward march glaring as he did so he took three stealthy steps towards us well
[00:37:34] you all chicken then there was not a titer nor even a hesitant shuffle meaning everyone was just standing
[00:37:43] fast I fought back to the days in France I thought of a carnage of the British prisoners of war
[00:37:49] the warric regiment heard it into a field just outside Dunkirk and machine gun to death by the
[00:37:54] waffen SS I thought of my home being blown to smithereens and how the Germans were blocking my
[00:38:01] ambition to become a London policeman I took a pace forward before it was too late
[00:38:11] and some time passes as they try and get everything organized and then it continues on I was to
[00:38:16] join number two commando later renamed the 11th special air service battalion and still later
[00:38:22] the first parachute battalion in Britain at that time there was little no knowledge of the techniques
[00:38:28] of parachuting so everything had to be thought out very carefully there were no special types of
[00:38:32] parachutes for jumping from aircraft and no suitable aircraft the whole lot had to be devised
[00:38:37] developed and tested all too often with fatal casualties or severe injuries just learning how to
[00:38:46] conduct parachute operations from scratch so they start their training and the training is
[00:38:56] is really really hard as you can imagine here we go now we settled down to some real soldiering
[00:39:04] and I actually begin to enjoy the tests thrust upon us I didn't realize it first that we were
[00:39:09] being used as human guinea pigs trying out new methods of roughing it and of delivering a soldier
[00:39:15] to the place of battle for everyone for everyone it was a taste test of strength involving
[00:39:21] guts sheer cunning and a determination to win some conditions were abominable but my conscious told
[00:39:30] me that this was a challenge I must rise to and again this is when you got someone that's learning
[00:39:38] through repetition how to take pain and suffering and do it in a way that is no factor
[00:39:55] jumping forward here through some training that they go through and all the training is just
[00:40:02] it's a it's a guinea pigs right the training is just guinea pigs they're just doing crazy things
[00:40:06] to these guys and then they do their first parachute jump get done with that within the next week
[00:40:11] our seven jumps had been achieved and we could not wait to sew those blue wings on the right arm
[00:40:16] of the battle's battle dressed blouse one laddy even brought his sewing kit along with him and sat
[00:40:22] down to the corner of the hanger to get them on before anyone else it was odd to see a man walking
[00:40:28] around in with and shot and manchester with their wings winged shoulders slightly forward of the
[00:40:35] rest of their bodies civilians and other non parasolgers were asking who are these blocks with the wings
[00:40:42] some sort of secret unit that's not a little bit of unit pride right this is why
[00:40:50] dichotomy of leadership when life and Seth disobeyed big jocco in what started wearing patches
[00:40:59] this is one of those things that you know I was thinking the back of my head like the if you're
[00:41:04] gonna if that makes you hold your chest out a little bit higher and you get that unit pride
[00:41:09] I'm gonna let it slide continuing on we were training both as parachutes and also for the
[00:41:17] specialized work of the commando which meant that a lot of extra work had to be put into achieve the
[00:41:23] very best end result above all above all it was emphasized it was emphatically stressed that we
[00:41:33] should never accept defeat even when up against overwhelming odds and we were taught to persevere
[00:41:39] to the end and to be able to endure great if not impossible fatigue sound familiar that's what we do
[00:41:53] that's what we do in the military taught to persevere to the end and I guess that's so much of that is
[00:42:04] so much of that is what the we know how you're taught to do that because you do it because when you go
[00:42:10] to like sealtraining or whatever there's no class that says okay when you get tired think about this
[00:42:17] no class that says that no class that says when you feel like you want to quit then you should think
[00:42:23] about this or you should say this no if you're if that's where your head is at and you want to
[00:42:28] quit there's no they don't teach you anything to stop it what what you learn the way you're taught
[00:42:34] is by oh I'm gonna get through this that's what's gonna happen I'm gonna get through this
[00:42:43] of course we have to learn a little bit about hand-to-hand combat we practice not only the use of
[00:42:50] the knife but also how to best avoid one when used against us Chinese experts taught us judo
[00:42:58] and unarmed combat with a rifle and fixed bayonet we would be flung at you or sorry a rifle with
[00:43:04] fixed bayonet would be flung at you by the instructor who yell come on lunge it me I
[00:43:10] lunged hesitantly for the first time come on long shanks lunge you won't get anywhere near me
[00:43:17] right made I thought you asked for it and I took a really good lunge but this man was an old hand
[00:43:22] like lightning he paired my blow and before I knew it I was flat on my back minus the rifle
[00:43:28] it was the same with the fighting knife and quite a few of us nursed cuts at the end of a
[00:43:33] day's training those knives were razor sharp just called real world in April of 1941 we were visited
[00:43:42] by Winston Churchill accompanied by Sir Arthur Barrett and Major General Sir Hastings is May and he goes
[00:43:51] he actually go I'm not going to tell the whole story but there's a one point where where reds has a
[00:43:57] little very short conversation with Winston Churchill and basically he's he's redges the receiver
[00:44:05] on a dison like a hand-to-hand combat display and he ends up getting from you know like a hip toss
[00:44:12] I'm imagining and and when he's done and he's gonna get him up off the ground and in Winston Churchill
[00:44:20] looks at him and says uh did you really try lad and and reds looks at him and says what do you
[00:44:28] bloody think sir and then he said Winston Churchill purses lips gave a big grin and waddled off looking
[00:44:36] delighted so that's pretty awesome interaction with Winston Churchill who by the way we haven't even
[00:44:44] we haven't even started to get into the Winston Churchill scene here on the podcast but you know it's
[00:44:51] covered you know it's covered and and that'll be I'm sure many podcasts and this is a little glimpse
[00:45:01] into the future continuing on bypassing usual military procedure various on orthodox methods
[00:45:08] and the use of small arms explosives were adopted and official eyes were shut so long as the end of
[00:45:13] the jaw and result was achieved one such stunt was with draw the safety pin from a hand grenade
[00:45:20] release the arm which we call the spoon release the arm which in turn would fire the four
[00:45:25] second fuse in the prime grenade making it really live hold it for a second and then throw it
[00:45:31] quickly the object being to make sure the enemy would have no time to throw it back and he won't
[00:45:36] refusing this dangerous venture would be subject to a variety of flowery names luckily we had no
[00:45:42] casualties to result and what makes that scariest so grenade as a four second fuse when you pull we
[00:45:48] are holding something that what do they call the arm it actually fits into the web of your hand this
[00:45:54] this this piece of like light aluminum and you when you put it in the web of your hand and then
[00:46:00] you hold the grenade that thing is stuck in place now you then you next thing you do is you pull the pin
[00:46:07] because when the pin's in there that arm doesn't go anywhere because it's spring loaded as soon as
[00:46:11] you pull the pin that there's tension on the spring that's ready to make that spoon or arm fly off and
[00:46:17] that's what arms it to blow up in four seconds the problem is is that the fuse is aren't perfect
[00:46:25] so depending on the fuse that you get could be could be three seconds could be six seconds
[00:46:32] could be four seconds like it's supposed to be is there a possibility it's two seconds yes there is
[00:46:38] so when you cook we call it cooking it off so when you cook off that grenade there's a possibility
[00:46:45] that it goes off but if you don't cook it off at all and you throw it
[00:46:53] and you can throw it back you're especially if it's four seconds and one of their choices
[00:46:56] they can either jump on it they can dive away or they can grab it throw it back if they think you
[00:46:59] haven't cooked it back well best thing do is get it out of there remember T Fred Harvey the
[00:47:05] he's getting grenade tossing fights with the Japanese so as this training is going on also
[00:47:17] we have to remember there's the mental fortitude part there's the tactical training but we can't
[00:47:22] ever forget just physically be in hard to keep on top form we had plenty of physical training cross
[00:47:28] country runs compass marches and night exercises discipline was self-imposed and any need to impose
[00:47:36] it by a superior was found upon yes that's what we want we don't want to we don't want to have to
[00:47:44] impose discipline run about in leadership strategy tactics that's not the if you have to impose
[00:47:49] discipline some strong then you're a strong your leadership is wrong because if you're leading correctly
[00:47:54] the troops will put discipline on themselves they will they will acquire self-discipline because
[00:48:00] they understand why it's important psychological and physical resistance were driven to the
[00:48:08] utmost until men could take their limit and even more but it was never enough we were marched counter
[00:48:15] marched and marched again in fair weather and in foul live ammunition fired at close range actually
[00:48:21] helped I found myself so preoccupied with making sure I did not get hit but I became oblivious
[00:48:25] to fatigue and plotted on at the end of the day's training I would stretch out on the hangar
[00:48:30] for absolutely shagged on passing sergeant Sid Oxley might prod me and say something like
[00:48:37] not bad lad not bad do better tomorrow eh get stuffed was the usual quiet reply as I slipped
[00:48:46] a well earned cigarette between my lips and drew hard so there's a pretty good chunk of this
[00:48:54] training in there and again all this training was they just created this they just created that
[00:49:00] this was new where like we're making up and props one thing when I look at the course of my entire life
[00:49:08] there's like a couple moments in time where things made an impression on me and one of the things
[00:49:14] that made an impression on me as a little kid was I had these toy soldiers I had a lot of toy
[00:49:20] soldiers but the British commandos from World War II they had little ladders they had little
[00:49:30] grappling hooks they had boats and they had beanies right you know what I'm talking about I
[00:49:38] when you're a little you don't know what a beanie is I know a beanie is yeah okay we you know when you see a stereotypical
[00:49:45] like let's say a robber in a movie and they're sneaking around and they're wearing a black beanie
[00:49:52] I think that all stems from the British commandos so for me when I saw like those little
[00:49:57] care it was a little soldiers that I had with black beanies and rubber rafts that look like Zodiacs
[00:50:04] they also had a little kayak for them too and I think all seeing those things I was always drawn
[00:50:11] to the maritime component of special operations interesting hey I want to be the close what's the
[00:50:19] close thing I can be to a British commando I see these guys with boats and and the weird thing is I mean
[00:50:26] that's that's not what these guys were doing and in fact and I didn't say this red red
[00:50:30] Curtis didn't know how to swim that's why he was so scared and he didn't he doesn't say it until
[00:50:35] he later in the book that's why he was so scared at Dunkirk that's why he's talking about how he's
[00:50:39] underwater there's nothing he can do about he's hanging around the rope because he does know how to swim
[00:50:42] and he's weighted down oh yeah but yeah the the British commandos which I'm sure will broke off
[00:50:48] from the parachute guys but that's kind of a major a major influence on a whatever six year old kid
[00:50:57] yeah I don't remember any well then again I guess I wasn't into the toy soldiers element
[00:51:04] yeah you were just getting like the regular big green toy soldiers from like the the grocery store
[00:51:09] right yeah yeah army men for sure I had NGJL I graduated from
[00:51:15] playing green army men two legit little soldiers that came from different units and I had all these
[00:51:24] different units and I knew what kind of gear they had with them I had the Africa core right
[00:51:29] the Nazi Africa core and again the ones that stand out were the ones that had like looked a little bit
[00:51:35] different the Africa core guys were canned instead of green the British commandos were green
[00:51:40] I had I had pair troopers they were these they were little army men just they were smaller than the
[00:51:47] regular army men smaller yeah they were small they were I think I think there are no main
[00:51:52] cladiers of one thirty second I think they were really small they were you know a half an inch tall
[00:51:57] maybe and maybe a three quarters of an inch tall and they still had individual soldier that bottom
[00:52:01] platform that little bottom platform huh and I would set up battle scenes you know out in the yard
[00:52:08] and play by play the way things were unfolding yeah you probably went deep though I'm like you know
[00:52:15] on the regular army men set man set the guy who's crawling in the little crawl guy yeah yeah
[00:52:21] like he would be flying sometimes in my own scenario yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:52:26] he could be in that flying position well I had that I had the model planes who I also had a
[00:52:32] teacher named Mr. McGurk in high school and he had a little army he had little planes all throughout
[00:52:39] his room the classroom hanging you know model little model planes model planes I had model planes too
[00:52:45] because it was all trying to make un-make this battle scenario and the weird thing is
[00:52:52] the weird thing is about this stuff is like okay if my son let's face it if my son has army
[00:52:58] soldiers we kind of expect that just to be normal right like hey of course I mean by the time
[00:53:02] that kid was born he had more soldiers than you know I'd do with yeah but there's some instinctual
[00:53:07] thing even you you are like back in Kauai right there's no I mean your mom wasn't
[00:53:15] saying hey I really want you to be interested in military stuff right and yet you had green
[00:53:19] army soldiers yes and even though some of them could fly which was a little bit unrealistic
[00:53:24] some of them were still low crawling right some of them were engaging in battle against other
[00:53:28] soldiers well yeah so you have an instinct for war yes and I think most just like I talked earlier
[00:53:36] about the instinct for like hey I'm part of something bigger than me which is a beautiful thing
[00:53:42] if you think about it right that's a beautiful thing like I am part of this group that I'm
[00:53:48] I'm subordinate to this group as a powerful thing and it has to be countered correctly because
[00:53:54] you don't want to be someone that gets brainwashed and joins a cult right the the Bhagwan Shri Raj
[00:54:02] Nish cult sir right you don't want to be that person no no yeah that is weird now that you mentioned
[00:54:10] that like yet it would call it an instinct for a instinct for war like I think because it's it's
[00:54:15] so common like consider like G. I just okay I'll say this scenario so we we had a we're my dad
[00:54:22] built their house and he well he was one of the people who built our house so when we're digging the
[00:54:28] cesspool it's like me skeptical septic tank septic tank I guess it's like a huge hole
[00:54:34] okay super deep anyway they put the cap on it okay um this big concrete cap on it okay and then they
[00:54:40] fill it in and then but as it remains is still a big hole like the size of a jacuzzi okay about
[00:54:46] that size but it's just a dirt hole okay it's weird it's like a it literally like a dug in jacuzzi
[00:54:52] in dirt so I'm not sure what this is but going yeah that's just the way it it's sorted itself out okay
[00:54:58] um so it sounds like a foxhole yeah you don't recall it that yeah but um for and then it
[00:55:05] it rained I'm quite rains pretty much every day yeah yeah no no no so it's storming but
[00:55:11] enough to put a cool little shallow puddle in the bottom of that and mud so we're in a muddy terrain
[00:55:19] scenario G. I. Joe yeah why is so we got hills we got the top of the hill we got the valleys
[00:55:25] the you know the water scenario at the bottom and oh yeah it was like battles going on the whole
[00:55:30] time we'd like stuff on fire and your dad was no military experience your mom was no military
[00:55:36] experience your neighbors my grandfather was at a D day but I did know that yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:55:42] that's right salute but I had no idea at this point obviously but but unless we're still doing it
[00:55:51] G. I. Joe's good guys versus bad guys killing like you know you could take up on the part of the
[00:55:55] G. I. Joe's like you could blow them all with fire crackers and then bury them and like do all
[00:55:59] this stuff you should have a very serious stuff oh yeah you were going deep yeah big time
[00:56:04] catching the whole dramatic and it's not like someone like told me to tell that and how much
[00:56:11] how much did you see how many warm movies had you seen on TV even remember I don't remember but
[00:56:17] you know you could I mean this is what like 80s we'll say like 90s maybe there's some 18 going on
[00:56:24] 18 and watch it not like religious anything so it's just we're talking to instinct that's the
[00:56:30] bottom yeah I did I mean mash was on I don't think I'd ever watch mash that's more than comedy though
[00:56:34] that's not like a but yeah it's kind of a comedy if you if you watch that show it's actually
[00:56:41] in many ways there's some pretty heavy episodes of mash for oh actually because I remember watching
[00:56:46] it when I was a kid and there's definitely I remember watching that movie going oh watching that show
[00:56:52] sometimes and you ever in suspecting the laugh but then sometimes it would be super heavy because
[00:56:57] they would occasionally inject war yeah yeah right and yeah so yeah so I think there's just an
[00:57:06] instinct that people can have at some level and I think obviously just like instinct of
[00:57:14] being something bigger than yourself that's an instinct that people can have at different levels right
[00:57:18] not everyone's a 10 in hey I want to be part of a group that's bigger than me not everyone not everyone is
[00:57:24] in fact I I would say maybe you don't even want to be a 10 because then you're just looking for a
[00:57:28] cult of joint right next thing you know you're buying a guy rolls Royces which is what you got to watch
[00:57:35] out for right so we're not looking to do that same thing with the war like instinct right there's
[00:57:38] some people that are pretty high up on that I believe I was pretty pretty high up on that because
[00:57:42] I don't remember wanting to do other things right so like when I thought about my future as a child
[00:57:48] the thought was be a soldier like that's what I remember be a commando that's what I remember
[00:57:56] so it's you know it's something that and I'm sure there's a bunch of other you know like a
[00:58:01] a fatherly instinct right or a motherly instinct or uh here's another interesting one
[00:58:07] some people like to travel right so people want to move around a lot some people want to stay home
[00:58:11] there's like different levels of instincts that people have some people want to settle down and hold
[00:58:16] what you got some people don't want to do that at all so people have various instincts so
[00:58:24] I would say that what they did in this training is hone the instincts that people did have
[00:58:31] and get rid of people that didn't have enough of the instinct for war and you know once again
[00:58:37] talking about seal training they're not really teaching you anything they're just getting rid of
[00:58:41] people that don't have the right instinct yeah that's what they're really doing they're not teaching
[00:58:47] anything you learn only because you learn from your experience but it's not an active teaching
[00:58:56] protocol yeah that's it so do you what do you think do you think that that's like
[00:59:01] good like is that and of course I'm gonna say is it the best way because we know it's the best way
[00:59:05] but is that kind of the best way to do it because it kind of seems like it could be the best way to
[00:59:09] do it like it's definitely it's definitely you're not gonna get neat well not you're gonna minimize
[00:59:14] the amount of stray voltage don't you kind of want to work with someone that has a higher instinct
[00:59:20] for winning yeah then someone that's got to be coaxed and trained yeah exactly what I'm saying
[00:59:26] that's what it seems like that's why it seems like it's a pretty good thing to me yeah it's almost
[00:59:29] like what you rather have on your football team someone that I think about this think about
[00:59:33] you're the who's the person that brings people onto the team it's not the coach but like the
[00:59:37] GM I don't know so let's say you're in control of a football team and you're gonna take this
[00:59:42] thing as far as you can this is your only job do you want the guy that you get that you have to
[00:59:47] train a bunch to get him to be able to run a fast for fast 40 or do you want a guy that comes
[00:59:54] out of the gate and he's kind of already there right this is the no-brainer of course now there are
[01:00:00] outliers that I actually want this guy that was slow but he's such a hard worker and a grinder
[01:00:07] that he's gonna excel anyways like I want that guy and guess what see what training does that you
[01:00:11] know if you're a gazelle and you're really great athlete it doesn't test you as much as the guy
[01:00:15] that's a grinder yeah but the guy that's a really great athlete has a little bit more value
[01:00:20] out of the gate than the guy that's a grinder once you show up at the team though you want the
[01:00:24] guy that's a grinder more than you want the guy that's a good athlete right yeah so almost like
[01:00:29] it's all sort of and that's not a guarantee every time because there's some guys that were
[01:00:33] freaking great athletes and they were just incredible so don't don't take that one wrong but
[01:00:39] necessarily a guy that's a great athlete versus a guy that is just has can gut through it
[01:00:46] probably I would lean towards the guy that can gut through it because he has a level of grit
[01:00:53] you're not you don't face a pull-up bar out in the battlefield right you're not you don't you know
[01:00:57] it's not there yeah and then and that makes sense I mean it's all kind of in the same bucket
[01:01:02] really but where like these are just attributes right so how does life put it he'll say um
[01:01:08] buds is just a screening process to weed out people who we don't think have the characteristics
[01:01:14] to be successful on the battlefield which is a very eloquent way of putting it eloquent so those
[01:01:19] characteristics aren't necessarily who can do the most pull-ups it's not that because look if you're
[01:01:25] doing like there's a minimum though right obviously like you have to do a certain amount of
[01:01:29] minimum is so minimum to like get to buds the minimum is so minimum it should be disqualifying
[01:01:34] if you can actually only do that many right not kidding the minimum pull-ups go to buds is something
[01:01:38] like 10 right tiny it's ridiculous yeah so just like how you said it's like okay we haven't
[01:01:45] we have a minimum and that's sort of it so who cares if you can do 50 who cares really
[01:01:51] we care about other stuff yeah well there's a well-rounded component right and and that's what
[01:01:57] makes that's the thing that makes the seal training hard is you can't just be a fast runner
[01:02:02] you can't just be a fast swimmer you can't just be strong upper body you can't just be comfortable
[01:02:10] in the water you can't just be durable you gotta be all those things and what's hard is they're
[01:02:18] contrary to each other right because being able to run 14 miles is one type of person that's
[01:02:26] going to be really good at that being able to get through the obstacle course is another person
[01:02:32] that has a lot of upper body strength this person has a lot of endurance this person have
[01:02:35] and then you add in hey you need to be able to pick up your body and sprint with them over the
[01:02:40] burn that's explosiveness so we want this really kind of middle of the road on a bunch of different
[01:02:47] things well-rounded as opposed to someone that's just really good at one particular thing and
[01:02:53] there's all kinds of people that show up that are great athletes in one category and it does a
[01:02:58] work for yes so that the attribute of all the attributes that attribute about the guy who can
[01:03:05] gut through stuff sort of lifts up all those attributes if didn't it not that high so let's say
[01:03:10] that's the main one then yes yes you want the guy who that comes naturally to rather than the guy who
[01:03:18] it might they're teaching may falter later I want that to be part of you makes sense part of you
[01:03:26] and man what a good quality to have that's the thing that's that's the thing people look we
[01:03:31] ever want to get to certain amount of talent you can decide to work hard you can decide to work
[01:03:38] hard now now there are people that say that work ethic is a talent right I get that concept
[01:03:45] and I think the reason it appears to be that way is because you get people that work so hard
[01:03:50] that you think oh that must be a talent of theirs right to have this talent that you're going to work
[01:03:56] so hard I don't I well I think that you have well you do you have way more influence over that
[01:04:03] talent than you do over your explosive strengths yeah I mean infinitely more yeah because you can't I don't
[01:04:09] know the of the seminal genetics expert but I don't know that there's a gene or a series of genes
[01:04:16] that gives you work ethic yeah I would say the answers no right I mean not not all right I mean we
[01:04:24] could check with the bro science like schools on that one yeah those but they're I bet you know when
[01:04:31] they start breaking down this genetic stuff they're going to start finding stuff about people that's
[01:04:35] going to be really interesting and some of it will be tight I mean I'm not going to say I'm Harris
[01:04:39] you know you're every decision that you make is kind of pre-plan free will but you know I'm
[01:04:46] sure Sam and I will have a chance to sit down if he has the courage to step up to the plates
[01:04:51] and have a real conversation with me but but I bet as this stuff gets uncovered they will find
[01:05:00] that there's a propensity like a propensity for focus yeah because that's what hard work is kind of
[01:05:08] is just hey look like when I was going to college and I would get to I would do one semester I took
[01:05:15] five English classes the dumbest thing I've ever done I would be so crushed with reading over you
[01:05:23] know during the week but then on the weekend would come and I'd have to read five English
[01:05:27] classes worth of reading and that was when I would be like okay I would have to like turn the
[01:05:33] switch in my head and just go fall on sit there and read for 10 hours and read and remember what I
[01:05:41] was reading so that was a switch it was like oh and I remember thinking myself I'd be talking to
[01:05:48] other people that had one English class and they'd say I'd say they said did you do the reading
[01:05:53] can you tell me what happened and I'd be like yeah of course I did the reading and they'd be like
[01:05:56] I cannot sit down and read for that long and I'd be like no hey you don't care
[01:06:01] be you like discipline see maybe I've got a little propensity to be able to turn it on or
[01:06:07] maybe it just through force of will look I want to get an A in this class why because
[01:06:14] because I don't want these instructors looking at me thinking that they got a little
[01:06:17] sunk mommy no you don't got anything on me I'll read this material and I'll know it
[01:06:23] yeah and all that it all that right there is it's so you do just so everyone realizes I'm not crazy
[01:06:29] that's just gamification that's just gamification in my head to make things fun to make things
[01:06:34] challenging right I'll do that with anything all day long you if I've got something to do I'm
[01:06:38] gonna have a good time with it yeah we're gonna have a good time with it I'm fine so when you hear me
[01:06:45] you know I was watching someone Larry Bird and he was this he's famous for talking trash
[01:06:51] to all the other players and but he works so hard he was also famous for his work ethic
[01:06:59] but I think there's a little bit of gamification right when you go I'm gonna do this to you I'm
[01:07:03] gonna do like he would come down the court be any you he'd say like he'd say uh the here comes
[01:07:08] three who wants it meaning come and try and guard me I'm gonna hit a three pointer and he would do it
[01:07:12] yeah you know there's a little bit of gamification people respond well that so that's me
[01:07:17] when I was going to college as a 28 year old man by the way I'm not talking I was an 18 year old
[01:07:21] kid all worried about how I looked and what the party well I'm worried about any of that yeah
[01:07:27] I was in there to win and in order to win I made it into a game for myself yeah oh you think you're
[01:07:32] gonna ask me you think that you're gonna come up with a question on this reading material that you
[01:07:36] gave me that I'm not gonna go to the answer to watch this so that way I'm actually banded tension
[01:07:41] actually paying attention what's going on as opposed to I don't care doesn't really matter
[01:07:47] I'm in the navy anyways who cares what I get for a grade ball ball ball ball ball I could make
[01:07:50] those excuses all day you can always take the easy path if you want to it's always there
[01:07:55] but you just gotta remember that it leads downhill and if you take the righteous path well
[01:08:00] then you're gonna move in the right direction yeah but it still seems like you got all those
[01:08:08] methods we'll say like from you know like you weren't born with that you know kind of thing
[01:08:14] you know it seems like you know you got yes it does see it seems like it's a choice that I make
[01:08:20] well and it seems also like where you like what you learned along the way what right how that's
[01:08:26] what what lessons got reinforced you know what lessons got reinforced for me if I don't work hard I'll
[01:08:32] lose yeah that lesson got reinforced I'm the over and over and over again if I don't work hard I'll
[01:08:37] lose if I work hard I can do better I might not win but I can do better and I'll tell you something else
[01:08:46] if your attitude is like if your attitude is only I'm gonna win like that's why I'm doing this
[01:08:53] you're not gonna win every time but let me tell you what your attitude can be I might not win
[01:08:58] every time but I'm gonna get your respect yeah you when you get done beating me when you get done
[01:09:06] beating me and you shake my hand you're gonna mean it because you you had you you're gonna mean it
[01:09:12] I'm gonna push you at a minimum that's what's happening so if you beat me and by the way I don't
[01:09:17] hold it against you when you beat me I respect if you beat me I know you worked I know you got I know
[01:09:21] you got after which is cool and I don't I don't held any angst whatsoever it's good actually
[01:09:28] because I know that this guy worked hard with me and I know I got to work even harder so good for you
[01:09:33] so that's that comes that's learned that's me learning as a kid oh I wasn't good at this
[01:09:41] and even I looked back in my life now like I wasn't great at soccer I never played soccer outside
[01:09:46] the soccer season other kids are running around dribble in the soccer ball whatever going to camp
[01:09:52] whatever I didn't didn't care enough didn't we didn't understand the first thing that I got well
[01:09:59] I got very focused in the sealed teams and in the sealed teams because you're going to get
[01:10:04] high caliber people not all of them but you got some people to top of the bell curve that are
[01:10:07] freaking bad asses and if you're if for me so I got these incredible athletes you know when I
[01:10:12] checked in a sealed team one I'm gonna try and think this was probably 10 of us went to
[01:10:17] sealed team one a pretty good chunk of you guys went to sealed team one there was some guys in
[01:10:21] that went to sealed team one that were total athletic studs I mean infinitely better than me
[01:10:30] and every category of athleticism you know and I knew like okay if I'm gonna hang with these guys
[01:10:36] I'm gonna have to work really really hard just to hang with just to hang with not to beat them
[01:10:42] just to hang with them so that idea gets reinforced over time okay if I don't work hard I'll be at the
[01:10:49] bottom of the barrel and and then what it boils down to if I'm at the bottom of the barrel how much
[01:10:54] am I helping with team because if I'm a if I'm a detriment to the team now now what am I
[01:11:02] even doing with my life right I do not want to be a detriment to the team I want to be a
[01:11:06] positive to the team and even though I might not be the best guy in the pollton I might not be the
[01:11:10] strongest the fastest the best shot whatever those things are if I'm third or fourth or fifth in
[01:11:16] some of those categories okay well now I'm a benefit to the team now I can help which is what
[01:11:23] it all boils down to and what it all boils down to is like you know you can make an excuse for yourself
[01:11:29] and live with it a little bit but you can't make an excuse for the team meaning hey look even in
[01:11:38] extreme case well you know if I'm not that great of a shot and the enemy gets a shot off
[01:11:42] quicker than me oh well I'm gonna die that's the that's the job of got that's the choice of you
[01:11:48] know whatever but if you just play that out one step further if I don't get this shot off
[01:11:53] this guy will have the chance to shoot one of my buddies that's you need to put more rounds down
[01:11:57] range you need to shoot more you need to get better and faster fast run your reloads fast run your
[01:12:02] draw faster in your side picture that's what you need to get better because you don't let your
[01:12:05] teammates down yeah so when that's what's really driving you that's powerful that's more powerful
[01:12:10] than I just want to be the best I don't want to just be the best because you can give yourself a little
[01:12:15] slack in there but when you look at it you say oh I don't want to let my teammates down they're
[01:12:21] counting on me that will make you stay up later that will make you wake up earlier that will drive
[01:12:28] you to try and be better and that lesson that lesson on me got reinforced over and over again
[01:12:35] and if I didn't work hard then I wouldn't be I failed something in Buds called pool competency
[01:12:43] and I should I to fail it right and I was gonna say I shouldn't have failed it and the reason
[01:12:50] I was gonna say I shouldn't have failed it was because I was comfortable in the water I
[01:12:52] done all the water stuff kind of first time every time meaning not tying in life saving I was good
[01:12:58] I felt really comfortable and so when I failed it I was sort of I was deeply disappointed
[01:13:05] that I failed it and I was hyper worried that maybe I'm not gonna make it through this training
[01:13:12] and so we mean a couple of the other guys that failed we spent the entire weekend
[01:13:17] in the dip tank which is the little box that you fill with water to clean stuff in
[01:13:24] and I don't even know why the instructor's lettuce he was dive gear I have no idea why this was not safe
[01:13:30] and maybe we just did it I don't really remember but we got in this dip tank and we
[01:13:34] did pool comp to each other for hours and we just ripped the stuff off and ripped you know
[01:13:40] crossed each other until we went through the procedure so many times when I went to retake pool
[01:13:45] comp it was it was easy it was easy when I went to retake it on Monday so what what lesson got reinforced
[01:13:52] I need to prepare more I need to work harder I need to go to the extra distance or else I can fail
[01:13:57] so there's another little reinforcement I told you this one before I failed the run in seal training
[01:14:02] why did I fail run I failed the run in seal training because I paced myself and said well you
[01:14:08] know I'll save a little something and I didn't have anything to save what I needed to do was run as hard as I could
[01:14:14] so I failed the run when I paced myself the next run what did I do when that when they said go
[01:14:20] I ran as fast as I could for the entire thing because you're not allowed to wear a watch so you have no idea
[01:14:24] what the time is you just and so you think about that you think about when you're cruising on a run versus
[01:14:30] when you're running as hard as you can it's hard to tell where that cruise level's at because
[01:14:34] am I running am I running a six minute mile if I'm cruising am I running a six thirdier
[01:14:40] or am I running a seven twenty it can be hard to judge especially when you're sore like your
[01:14:45] your body sore so you know if you did if you did 500 eight count body builders at three o'clock in the
[01:14:52] morning and then you go out and you run your run your pace you might seem like you're running faster
[01:14:57] than you really are so when I learned from that I failed the run and now what I have to do I've
[01:15:03] realized I can never let off again can ever so there's a little lesson getting reinforced
[01:15:09] over and over and over again don't leave it up to chance don't leave it up to chance do let
[01:15:13] do the work and that's the way that's how you develop these things no one told me no one told me
[01:15:20] what I just said I would maybe I wish somebody's would have and the reason I say maybe is because
[01:15:24] maybe you still don't learn it because there's some things that you have to actually go through
[01:15:29] there's some things that the only thing that's going to teach you is experience yeah and
[01:15:33] even like these you went through these things where the environment sort of provided these lessons
[01:15:40] no matter how like over or covert they were like provided to you through the environment like
[01:15:46] you know like a like a farmer or something like this someone who's sort of grew up just working
[01:15:50] hard as a way of life you put them in another environment we're working hard will show itself
[01:15:54] or whatever or they'll work hard yeah because the environment sort of provided that whatever
[01:15:59] so yeah so that makes sense you know and obviously we can't count every second of your life
[01:16:04] and years where this came from and it was it you know obviously but it seems like the work ethic
[01:16:09] and being able to like show fortitude like mentally through things or whatever it seems like
[01:16:14] that's an environmental thing fully it is and that's why redcurrence was biking five miles to work
[01:16:19] in five miles home every day monday through Saturday yeah six days a week get some up in
[01:16:24] will please upill both ways so that is what they learned in this training some of these things
[01:16:32] that we just talked about and and again the book details these things really well but we're going
[01:16:39] to jump ahead right now to a chapter five accrues to North Africa on the ship I bordered
[01:16:45] and after endless trudging along narrow passageways and up and down the steep stairs and
[01:16:50] gangways I was directed to an area below the waterline after the ship soon after casting off
[01:16:55] we learned that we were heading for Algiers from where we would take part in a combined
[01:17:00] operation by Great Britain in the United States codenamed operation torch that's legit you get on
[01:17:05] this ship to leave you don't even know where you're going you're just going to go get some
[01:17:09] you yeah that's what you know you're going to go get some
[01:17:12] moving forward here they're on the ground um and again I hate to skip these parts this is a book
[01:17:21] you got to get and I'll talk about how to get it again because it's not a normal book we were
[01:17:27] informed that our objective was an enemy emergency air strip close to a place called Suk El Arba
[01:17:34] in Tunisia along the way we were attacked by two M.E.109s but these were success we shot down by our
[01:17:42] escorts of Spitfires boom thanks to the Americans easing their rule about smoking on aircraft
[01:17:48] I managed to feel more relaxed by puffing through half a dozen cigarettes so now they're going
[01:17:52] for their jump by the way they're going to jump into this um into this emergency air strip
[01:17:59] it was a three hour journey in very hot and humid heat and we sat in the plane sweating like
[01:18:04] pigs singing songs and cracking jokes to try and hide our feelings chunky said well lofty
[01:18:09] that's his nickname he brings up a couple times well lofty won't be long now
[01:18:13] see you in heaven you must be joking mate I replied turtley he's got to be a damn good
[01:18:20] Jerry to catch up with me then the order was bellowed out action stations it made me shiver
[01:18:26] hook up I was sweating sweating like hell and fell a bit weak at the knees I wondered out loud
[01:18:35] what sort of reception are we going to get what mate crabsriast oh nothing I'm uttered
[01:18:41] I hooked up my line with shaky fingers managing to endure 10 minutes of standing
[01:18:47] while the plane came to in to drop us at the airfield out in the wild 70 miles
[01:18:52] from Tunis so the reason I put that part of there is just letting everybody know especially
[01:18:58] you young troopers out there that are going on hold the line you're going to be scared
[01:19:03] and even this guy that is just a fundamental badass across the board is shaking fingers
[01:19:09] he's sweating profusely he's scared and by the way he's hiding it to the best of his ability
[01:19:17] he's keep he's stifling that emotion continue on the jump master's piercing voice cut through
[01:19:23] the sound of the aircraft stand to the door I swallowed hard and prepared for the exit
[01:19:28] when the order to go rang in my ears I became a changed man it suddenly felt so much cooler
[01:19:33] being whisked about in the air all around me were hundreds of parachutes we were finally dropping
[01:19:38] in action there you go so you're going to be scared once you get in the action you'll settle down
[01:19:49] and okay so now this is the land they move and now they get into a situation
[01:19:58] we were machine gun costly one minute we were in put in buses and the next taking cover
[01:20:03] once with Pat Dolan and chunky I dash for safety across an open ground and slid into a hundred feet
[01:20:10] slid into a hollow 100 feet from a derode as three small specks of mishrishmets
[01:20:15] came diving straight for us from 4,000 feet I lay on my stomach looking at the aircraft through
[01:20:20] my camouflage net scarf as they came in fast much closer now and three of them open fire one
[01:20:25] concentrating on the road transport the other two honor men scrambling for cover on each side of the road
[01:20:30] bullet slash the ground ten feet from us kicking up fountains of dust bloody hell pat that was
[01:20:36] close said chunky they circled and came in for another run this time really low only about
[01:20:42] 50 feet from the ground a couple of our act-act guns let fly jerry let rip and muck seem to be
[01:20:50] flying everywhere mainly rock splinters and dust as one aircraft clattered by I saw quite
[01:20:56] plainly the pilot with a white scarf around his neck you fucking fool you might have killed us
[01:21:02] someone shouted and then let out a bellowing laugh amazingly after all that strafing no one was
[01:21:08] seriously hurt and only two of our vehicles were rendered unserviceable as time went on things
[01:21:13] continued to hot up and the buses were soon abandoned in favor of foot slogging so again this is like
[01:21:23] a horrifying thing to think about these measures met one-on-nines coming down and strafing you
[01:21:28] with machine gun this pushing forward a little bit in the book there another situation
[01:21:38] then they turn towards us three stucodive bombers approaching us at about five thousand feet the
[01:21:43] sky was clear invisibility was good it was most weird not knowing whether they were interested in
[01:21:48] us or just passing but they were interested in us all right the leading pilot made half a roll
[01:21:54] and nose down the preliminary commencing that awe-inspiring stucodive angle of 85 degrees as it
[01:22:02] wind nearer I could see the evil go-win shape so clearly it seemed to be approaching me head on
[01:22:08] and it was and I was at my wits end as to whether I should get out and run for it or stay safely
[01:22:15] put but possibly perish before I could make up my mind us off for black dots moving away from the
[01:22:20] aircraft they were bombs seemingly aimed directly at me they're discent accompanied by a high-pitch
[01:22:28] scream I gripped my smock and braised myself the sides of my slit trench took shook and a shower
[01:22:35] of freshly dug soil cascaded over my face partly filling the trench Christ that's closed I thought
[01:22:40] it allowed the other two stucos came into repeat the treatment and there seemed to be a never-ending
[01:22:45] succession of bombs violently vibrating around then the drone aircraft drifted away and as
[01:22:51] as black smoke below slowly skyward voices began to ring out as men sought to
[01:22:57] sought reassurance that others were okay chunky was there on the edge of my trench asking
[01:23:02] if I was all right putting on a brave front I said I was and I was except for a little excretion
[01:23:12] but then getting away with nothing more than a wet pants after that lot did not hurt my pride
[01:23:19] I didn't tell the others though so that freaking bombs drop right on top of them
[01:23:25] pistons pants no factor happy to be alive continue on we need only been in and this is
[01:23:36] again skipping we had only been in Tunisia for a few days in our bag of enemy killed or captured
[01:23:40] was fast increasing together with quite an assortment of armored cards motorbikes and weapons
[01:23:48] they get into some gun fights I found myself going on a volunteer burial party for men
[01:23:53] known to be lost or killed in action for any dead or wounded paras that's a parachute guys
[01:24:01] the Arabs could be the biggest menace as some of them would think nothing of stripping
[01:24:06] a corpse of its clothing and then just leaving it if a ring would not come off the finger with
[01:24:11] ease the finger might be severed to achieve their greedy end at times it was reported that wounded
[01:24:17] both sides were mutilated by these scum and here he's out on these um basically like on a
[01:24:27] little burial party after some of these battles had taken place we came upon two more paras
[01:24:34] one lying by a large rock a jagged cut with dried blood right across his temple
[01:24:40] the other just a few yards away looking a bloated blue green
[01:24:45] I had seen dead soldiers before usually just after being killed but this retrieving of
[01:24:51] private papers of private papers and dog tags from dead men was not in my book of training
[01:24:57] and I was lost for a moment wondering if I was alone in this nightmare
[01:25:02] and then there's a there's a podray with a minister with him and he says the podray broke
[01:25:08] the silence by inquiring in a most serene voice now who have we here we buried those two side by
[01:25:18] side and then he goes forward here things were beginning to hot up now and we found ourselves
[01:25:27] taking part in some large scale skirmishes with an enemy who is not going to take it all lying down
[01:25:32] now he says hot up he doesn't say heat up and he says that throughout the books that's why
[01:25:38] I prayed for a little extra expression on it so people don't think that I was misreading it
[01:25:44] but he says things were beginning to hot up now maybe we'll bring that back
[01:25:51] and here we go fast forward a little bit I was just taking a position with the mortar
[01:25:55] when the CEO went around firing his pistol on the open side slots of the tanks and calling
[01:26:00] for the crews to come out so here's the CEO and there's some tanks some enemy tanks and this
[01:26:04] guy's approaching him with the pistol on reaching the third tank shots were fired back and he fell
[01:26:10] clutching his chest followed by his agitin captain Miles Whitelock who is hitting the face
[01:26:17] amid the general den of battle I was too busy to get trying to get dug into the rocky soil to
[01:26:23] make out exactly what had happened but soon learned that the CEO had been severely wounded and
[01:26:28] major Pearson was now to take over command it was a great blow to me at this time also to hear
[01:26:35] the death of my old friend Stanley Wandless I was horrified by a different site and a
[01:26:44] enormous brute of a pig munching away at a dead German soldier it seemed the pig had somehow
[01:26:51] come across the wine in this farm got filthy drunk and was eating everything
[01:26:56] such scenes became horribly familiar but my stomach gradually grew accustomed to them
[01:27:05] on Christmas day 1942 I watched the rain fall as I tried to make myself a little more comfortable
[01:27:09] in my slit trench rain trickled down my neck my hands were wet and cold and if I had had a
[01:27:15] cigarette I would have enjoyed it my feet had been constantly wet for god knows how long and I was
[01:27:19] beginning to feel a teeny bit browned off when good news we were being withdrawn for arrest off we went
[01:27:28] to sucel comis where I thoroughly enjoyed the luxury of a mobile bathroom it de-lousing and refitting
[01:27:37] it was heaven but we soon returned to the grind once more so again I picked out some highlights of
[01:27:44] the first kind of action that they had but you have to get the book to kind of follow along exactly
[01:27:50] what they'd been through but they'd been through really tough fighting and then finally they get the
[01:27:56] they get the turn they get the word that they're going to take a little break which they do but
[01:28:01] you know like I said earlier it's it's a little break it's not big and just like I talked about
[01:28:07] the times where you get a little reprieve from the cold wet miserable but then you'd
[01:28:13] it's time to go back in and that's what you have to do and these guys do that.
[01:28:19] going on here between the two they're then up in this spot between the two towns is a hill called
[01:28:25] Jebel Montmansoir the commanding height to the pont du tunis road it's 2000 feet above sea level
[01:28:35] five miles around at the base and has an easiest climbing angle of 45 degrees also known by
[01:28:41] us as hill 648 it was occupied by crack German Africa core and alpine troops and it was our
[01:28:48] job to take it at all costs. I thought this word would be a tough nut to crack but the
[01:28:57] men were determined to win through this through but the men were determined to win through
[01:29:04] and shift the enemy once and for all we checked our arms and ammunition and collected 48 hours
[01:29:11] of rations. So there's this dominant high ground that they need to take and it's got their
[01:29:17] Africa core who I talked about earlier it's got the alpine troops these are these are really good
[01:29:23] German troops and this point early in the war you know this is when this is when the German
[01:29:27] military was really really good I mean later in the war they were still good but they you know
[01:29:36] they suffered massive casualties and they started having like little you know younger troops
[01:29:41] inexperienced troop Hitler youth you know kids that were 14 years old out on the front lines
[01:29:44] getting after it this is early in the war these are experienced troops you know these are the troops
[01:29:50] that were this is where you know the the Prussian roots of military genius are showing through
[01:29:58] and these troops and this is it this is these are tough tough this is a tough enemy so going on here
[01:30:08] we started off and it was quite a long way over rough and uneven ground before we halted at
[01:30:13] the base of an ugly massive looking hill the usual advanced bombardment that preceded most
[01:30:18] attacks was not forthcoming on this occasion as we wanted to maintain the element of surprise
[01:30:22] this time Jerry would be first to rock the boat as we waited at the base of the hill the sky now
[01:30:29] and again became bright with German nightlights which when fired heavenward made the whole area
[01:30:35] quite luminous everyone froze until they fell to earth and safety returned once more in the form of
[01:30:41] semi-darkness in this waiting game I found my thoughts strange back to England what I could do for a
[01:30:49] couple of finds pints of English beer there's not until four o'clock in the next morning we ventured
[01:30:55] carefully toward forward through the undergrowth up went to more German nightlights then two more
[01:31:02] then still more the places illuminated like daylight they must have got wind of us or smelt us
[01:31:07] we could determine the nationality of a soldier from at fifty feet if the wind was favorable
[01:31:12] so probably they could do the same from the top of the hill two machine guns began firing
[01:31:17] then more joined in as the place were alive with them and they slashed and ripped mercilessly
[01:31:22] at the brack and slicing the branches of trees as if an invisible sharp knife had done the job
[01:31:27] I'll pull it went through my trouser leg gazing my thigh but I didn't think too much of it as I was
[01:31:32] still mobile German mortar started hitting the approach slope and yells a pain here and there told
[01:31:38] me to take more care the wine overhead was also warning that the enemy artillery was joining in
[01:31:45] as things hot it up with the occasional tracer bullet mixed in with the machine gun fire I could
[01:31:50] almost feel the hot led piercing my limbs it was certain I would not get away with this time
[01:31:55] farther back things had gone wrong with our usual stalwart mules the amazing animals that
[01:31:59] carried our heavy gear where men could not set foot they didn't appreciate the sudden shelling
[01:32:04] and bolted out of control major clums be Thompson managed around some of them up with the
[01:32:11] help of a French officer major pre-alue and then all housing to be let loose our man our men yelling
[01:32:20] woo hoo Muhammad as the R&T companies went in with their bayonets unfortunately asked company
[01:32:27] miss their correct route the tapes laid to assist their assent had been damaged or cut by the enemy
[01:32:33] activity and at the count we were to find that they had suffered extremely heavy casualties and
[01:32:40] this can't of woo hoo Muhammad this is throughout the time that they're fighting in Africa and they do it
[01:32:46] when they get to Europe as well it's just the we something that the locals did and they started doing it
[01:32:50] too it's kind of like the term gung ho which gung ho the the Chinese turn which means work it's
[01:32:59] actually a Chinese communist term which means work together and you know we use it and they started
[01:33:06] using it I believe isn't a Korean war they started using that term but I had been in World War
[01:33:12] II working with the Chinese anyway I the I must have been when it was must have been
[01:33:16] we're doing World War II when they were working with the Chinese and the Chinese would say gung ho
[01:33:21] work together kind of means get fired up down well now yeah that's how we use it Americans
[01:33:28] we can take work together and turn it into get after it the barrage we were set up against was intense
[01:33:37] and a ricocheting bullet or shell splinter often did as much damage or more that is straightforward
[01:33:41] burst of fire we could occasionally be lucky at one time an artillery shell failed to explode on
[01:33:47] impact with the ground and went on mercilessly ricocheting three times before coming to a rest with a doll
[01:33:53] plop but the bombardment was unrelenting and we had to work and we had our work cut out here
[01:34:01] there was agonizing shrieks of pain right and left to me as I passed unrecognizable
[01:34:06] as I passed men unrecognizable soaked in blood being tended to a barrage splendid medics
[01:34:12] those unsung unarmed heroes Sam cost her and Frankie Thompson reached the summit and searched
[01:34:17] out and dealt with the enemy with no ceremony whatsoever as Sam told me afterward Frankie was
[01:34:25] lunging and tossing men with his bayonet as though he as though they were sacks of straw
[01:34:30] Frankie was a big chap usually very friendly and quietly spoken but an action
[01:34:35] a different man picture that bayonet on your rifle and your throwing men off of it lunging
[01:34:46] and throwing men with the bayonet as if they were sacks of straw Frankie Thompson done play
[01:34:54] amid the turn all the turmoil and dead and wounded of both sides the curtain of fire had lifted
[01:34:59] and it was not a sound this is once they get up to the hilltop looking around the hilltop
[01:35:08] only a few of our men could be seen moving among the twisted forms our R T and S companies
[01:35:15] had suffered very heavy casualties more than half of the battalion officers had been killed or wounded
[01:35:22] he as they kind of get settled on the top of the hill he as they're preparing for a counter
[01:35:32] attack which they know the Germans are going to do he gets sort of tasked with going around and helping
[01:35:38] and gather up the sick dead or the wounded in the dead he goes on here setting about the job of
[01:35:43] collecting the wounded was something sickening as I gazed upon the scene of our once able and
[01:35:50] live comrades now quite still or with torn limbs I wondered whether there was any such thing as civilization
[01:35:59] I bet hard on my lip and went about my task with grim determination
[01:36:05] looking around for someone to help I noticed a lad who is in the same troop as me early in
[01:36:11] 1941 hello taffy and one of you been up to like a lift that's how he greets this guy cheers lofty
[01:36:20] and like I said lofty is the nickname of red cheers lofty is nice to see someone alive he said
[01:36:26] weirdly he was in a sitting position and apparently been hit by no fewer than five bullets
[01:36:32] they were all clean flesh wounds in the calf five four arm and one through the apex of his
[01:36:38] penis and all rather uncomfortable but no broken bones he was pretty well saturated with blood
[01:36:47] but cheerful let's try a fireman's carry I suggested he'd had a shot of morphine so I didn't think
[01:36:55] he'd feel he would feel too much anything to get away from here he said at that point Jerry started
[01:37:01] up again with artillery and mortars then a few snipers and to make it really interesting
[01:37:06] some sookah dive bombers stuccus dive bombers to join in the chorus let's get going before it gets
[01:37:14] too hot I've got to get you on my back I said so once again this is you know he's saying this
[01:37:22] so kind of matter of faculty he's up there trying to rescue this wounded guy who's obviously
[01:37:27] badly wounded he's been shot five times and then they start with artillery and mortars
[01:37:34] and then snipers and then stuccadive bombers that's what's going on and then he says he says
[01:37:40] let's get going before it gets too hot it's like it doesn't get any hotter
[01:37:46] I've got to get you on my back I said I managed to get him over my shoulder without causing too much pain
[01:37:51] and we started along the long trek through wounded country ravines and open waste it was a
[01:37:56] ticklish and tender drop job but for two hours we struggled on I was sweating like two pigs and he
[01:38:02] goes through a description of how hard it was to get this guy to an area where he could get some
[01:38:08] of the help that he needed once he gets that guy dropped off continuing on I joined a section
[01:38:14] comprising men from T and S companies they were mostly newcomers I wondered what to become of all
[01:38:21] the friends I had not seen since the attack started one of the lads told me that major canron
[01:38:26] had been killed and captain meller too I felt so alone no disrespect to the reinforcements
[01:38:33] but the cream of our men were fast disappearing in the foothills of Tunisia
[01:38:38] Jerry was counter attacking in earnest now and slinging everything at us in the way of explosives
[01:38:45] with batches of stuccadive bombers joining in at two hour intervals and making things even more
[01:38:51] deafening the muck was falling heavily and a splinter from a nearby bursting bomb
[01:38:58] slashed of vain in my right hand while another praying to my helmet
[01:39:05] nipping over rocks and creeping through bracken and bush under a hail of bullets and screaming
[01:39:11] shells I had become I became cut off from the party of men I'd been attached to I was making
[01:39:16] good progress and stopping for a breather dropped into a small depression in the ground.
[01:39:22] Suddenly alone German pounced on me from the rear I realized what was happening instantly
[01:39:27] when I saw the field gray cut of his uniform my schmizer which was out of ammunition was
[01:39:34] slung band-lear fashion over my shoulder but I had an american 45 automatic cult ready in my right hand
[01:39:40] I went down on one knee summoned up the unarmed combat I had been taught
[01:39:45] grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and heaved him with all my force over my head it was my turn now
[01:39:50] and I was not so gentle as he rolled onto his back I sprang and landed my 14 stone weight
[01:39:56] feet first on his chest grabbing the cult which I had released to dangle on its landyard I
[01:40:01] started to squeeze the trigger shouting you butcher bastard to his no no comrade no no no
[01:40:08] I pulled the trigger but it was empty I grabbed his rifle check that it was loaded and ordered him
[01:40:17] to his feet donka donka he kept saying hugging his chest as we moved off and with that he
[01:40:24] starts moving to get this prisoner back under control arriving back at Borada after the
[01:40:31] formality of delivering my prisoner to custody I rejoin the rest of the battalion we were in
[01:40:36] great need of rest and a refit and we were and we're all sent by truck to a place called
[01:40:43] tabursuk some 60 miles away wall Borada was handed over with thanks to the Americans
[01:40:54] we were very soon back with the great so they get a little breather we were very soon back with a
[01:40:59] brigade this time in the Jebel aboid area the brigade's manpower was well down with the enemy
[01:41:06] and the enemy usually outnumbered us three to one death ridge as my pet one parah
[01:41:13] as my first parah position in happy valley was known also developed the name shell shock ridge
[01:41:19] I tried closing my eyes at any given explosion it was a terrible feeling like waiting to be
[01:41:26] massacred the German started to mount an attack it was daylight and I could see motorized
[01:41:33] enemy units being dropped off at points as near as they dared to our positions three or four
[01:41:39] miles off in the direction of sedegene they spread out and extended order and started tortoise
[01:41:47] we were told to hold our fire until the last minute so the whole first battalion lay very quiet
[01:41:52] and still and we mortars saturated the area I felt the draft of an exploding shell which
[01:41:57] defamed my left ear and left it ringing and at the same time propelled me to the bottom of my trench
[01:42:03] making me even wetter than I already was now the mortar braided lift and I'm skipping ahead a
[01:42:10] little bit now the mortar brazed lifted and I could hear the silence of the solider machine gun fire
[01:42:16] as it severed the undergrowth the enemy getting near all the time 60 yards 50 yards 40 yards
[01:42:24] I peaked gingerly over the edge of my hole in the ground 30 yards 20 yards then above the din
[01:42:30] the order was bellowed fire fire fire advance advance as we went out to meet them the
[01:42:38] battalion flung everything the enemy that it flung everything at the enemy that it could
[01:42:43] Tommy guns brand guns stand guns capped captured solathorns and smithers grenades English
[01:42:50] German Natayan coupled with the cry of woo hoo Muhammad gripping my rifle I advanced through
[01:42:56] the murderous fire the haze of smoke and the accurate smell of explosives every available man was
[01:43:02] on this one even the cooks before long the tables had turned in our favor with two dead
[01:43:07] paras lying to my left I hopped over a dead German and came upon a wounded one a little to my
[01:43:12] right he was contemplating using a luger pistol but I booted it from his hand and clomped him
[01:43:17] in the face with the butt of my rifle the whole episode was soon over with the enemy beating a
[01:43:23] hasty retreat and leaving a bag of captured clean shaven German parasheus flown in direct from
[01:43:29] Germany to deal with us one a shock for them so that's like just again whatever a couple
[01:43:38] paragraphs maybe two paragraphs and I mean it's total insanity right the guys are 20 yards away
[01:43:46] before they get the the order not only to fire but to advance continuing on this is now they're
[01:43:59] doing a coordinated attack while we pushed on with two paras and three paras brought up the rear
[01:44:06] the British 139th brigade attacked on our right in time the pimple on this name of like a little
[01:44:12] null was retaken and our brigade proceeded to press home the final assault amidst devastating artillery
[01:44:19] and mortar fire from both sides tragically we found that we had gone a little too fast for our
[01:44:28] 25 pounders to increase their range quickly enough and we suffered heavy casualties from our own fire
[01:44:36] at daylight I passed a jock Pearson crouched by a rock bellowing into a field radio and none
[01:44:44] too pleased with the person on the other end what do you think you're doing he wrote you're killing
[01:44:50] all my bloody men so little horrible blue on blue scenario happening man everything but everything
[01:45:06] seemed to be in our favor now even the weather was kinder and we must have advanced about eight
[01:45:11] miles under a curtain of continuous fire both until both Italians and Germany were ready to
[01:45:17] give in and we're running to be captured so think about this scene with just massive fire and you're
[01:45:27] advancing under that fire for eight miles they get um they're they're doing this they're continuing
[01:45:42] to advance in this part and here measure schmets buzz the area spraying the ground spasmotically
[01:45:46] and causing those nearest to drop quickly into convenient holes we pushed on at a steady pace
[01:45:51] passed demolition guns past demolished guns and supplied dumps the air stinking with a pollen butchery
[01:45:59] I glanced and stinctively towards a shell burst fifty yards away as I watched its jet black smoke
[01:46:06] belt skyward my gaze was transfixed by something odd on the ground I wanted if it could be a human
[01:46:12] drawing nearer I saw that it was the roasted body of a man in the sitting position he must have
[01:46:19] been driving a scout car or light vehicle as there were small pieces of charred twisted metal
[01:46:24] spread fifty feet around with dismembered arms and legs torn and blood soaked uniforms
[01:46:32] littering the black scorched soil the aroma was diabolical someone accidentally brushed the
[01:46:40] sitting form on passing and the body simply disintegrated with a sickly sound fast forwarding a bit
[01:46:52] the smell of burnt flesh coated in my direction and I quickly and I quick into my pace to get
[01:46:59] clear of it plotting on in these awful humid and dusty conditions I think I felt almost immune
[01:47:05] to wearing this and the shocking sights of war nothing seemed to be able to stop us now
[01:47:17] and this is again you got to read this book but this site sort of concludes this section the first
[01:47:22] parachute brigade group was not destined to take part in the final push to tuna's our role
[01:47:29] in the campaign had come to an end and we were withdrawn from the line so ending five months hard
[01:47:37] slog and again that we were just burning through this book and I'm skipping so many sections
[01:47:43] this stuff is this is five months this is half a year just about of this type of fighting
[01:47:51] originally trained as shock troops in Tunisia after the initial parachute assaults
[01:47:58] we had served as plain infantry but that's just the way the wind blew for us
[01:48:04] metals were plentiful and all ranks had earned them eight distinguished service orders
[01:48:10] 15 military crosses nine distinguished conduct metals 22 military metals
[01:48:17] three raw digger and one legion to honor in their own way even our German adversaries had
[01:48:29] recognized the brigades fighting ability by naming us the red devils for those who are there
[01:48:37] though the price of success was unspeakably high we had lost more than 1700 men killed wounded
[01:48:49] or missing so again I hate to burn through five months of insane fighting
[01:48:59] and I'll take a dig at red right now like he's so matter of fact about stuff and he only
[01:49:10] hits on the high points I'm hitting on the high points of the high points right just insane
[01:49:16] insane to think about that for five months so from there they're transported from Tunisia
[01:49:24] back to Algeria and they spend time training for a drop into Sicily a parachute drop
[01:49:32] in Sicily which once again you're fighting in Africa look it's really tough conditions in
[01:49:37] Africa now you're getting closer to Germany like you're going into going into Sicily you know
[01:49:42] what's waiting for you it was hoped that if Sicily could be taken it might prompt an Italian
[01:49:50] surrender a large proportion of my battalion including myself now went down with this entry
[01:49:57] goes in and talking about a lot of that this is no this is just it's like no nothing's easy
[01:50:04] between exercises we acclimat acclimatized our reinforcements to use every
[01:50:10] they're used every type of enemy weapons including Schmeizer automatic which we found superior to our own
[01:50:15] standgun so now they start preparing for this mission in Sicily there were three bridges to take
[01:50:25] in Sicily and the password for them was to be desert rats with the reply kill Italians
[01:50:37] as the plane took off chunky said well this is it our second operation
[01:50:41] I tried to act normally but could feel the sweat running down my cheek so once again he's
[01:50:48] stifling some emotions in here they go getting on this getting ready to do this drop
[01:50:58] and this is just it's just crazy as we drew nearer to our objective and at a thousand feet
[01:51:05] I could see the flack and tracer zipping past the wing of the aircraft for 30 minutes we
[01:51:12] dodged everything they threw at us but it was a tens half hour as we were helpless to do anything
[01:51:18] so you're in an airplane you're getting ready to parachute and there's flack bombs exploding around
[01:51:24] you trying to take down your aircraft and tracer fires zipping but you know how much protection
[01:51:29] an aircraft gives you from tracer fire from machine gunfire zero what's flack so it's anti-aircraft
[01:51:39] they set it for a certain altitude it goes up in the air and then just blows up in hopes that
[01:51:43] some of that shrapnel will hit the aircraft and damage the aircraft and take them down
[01:51:47] so flack jacket is to roll it so flack actually flack is just little chunks of its fragmentation
[01:51:57] right all chunks of metal that that come off of explosive device that could grenade or a artillery
[01:52:05] round that's going to blow up like on purpose yes that's what it for and then a flack jacket
[01:52:10] is to protect you from flack good yeah and in the old days like the flack the term
[01:52:16] flack jacket the flack jacket would protect you from flack it wouldn't protect you from a bullet
[01:52:20] because flack isn't going as fast as a bullet is so like an old school Vietnam flack jacket
[01:52:27] wouldn't stop bullets but it would protect you from flack yeah like motorcycle jacket kind of thing
[01:52:32] like it's like it'll it'll protect you but not from the real deal yeah yeah yeah so even
[01:52:38] so even nowadays right the expression like don't give me any flack it's like kind of that yeah yeah
[01:52:43] exactly yeah exactly what it is so these guys are up there and like he says helpless
[01:52:50] and by the way this is a half an hour of this
[01:52:55] suddenly we were given continuing suddenly we were given the order to hook up I did so
[01:53:00] and waited the engines cut back on the approach to our drops on we descended to around 600 feet
[01:53:05] with all sorts of rubbish whizzing by and the plane pitching and tossing like a toy in a vast
[01:53:09] vacuum then there came a terrific explosion as our tail was hit the order jump man jumped
[01:53:18] screamed in my ears and I tumble through the doorway into the void below so they are craft finally
[01:53:25] takes a devastating hit he doesn't he doesn't mention whether the aircraft made it or not he just
[01:53:30] says that it you know the tail was hit hard I can't imagine that's super easy to fly a plane
[01:53:35] what's the tail's been blown off now he gets on the ground again fast forward a little bit
[01:53:42] on the ground about 300 yards in my left was the main coastal road to the town of
[01:53:49] Katania and enemy traffic wasn't tremendous confusion to my rear I could hear Italian voices
[01:53:57] and about a hundred yards to my right Germans wrapping out orders then now the road came a 15
[01:54:03] strong German patrol they could have been parachutists judging by their dress and head gear
[01:54:09] fortunately I was not alone when they were just a few yards off and we opened up on them
[01:54:15] there were some grunts, groans and sickly yelps then silence we slipped on in the direction of the
[01:54:21] bridge around which our men were by now silently killing harassing and panicking the German
[01:54:27] Italian defenders at night small battles raged unceasingly and we were pinned down for a long
[01:54:35] time by mortar fire when daylight broke though I saw the for the first time the vast mountain scenery
[01:54:40] at the base of which we had been fighting again I'm just jumping through stuff then the sun starts
[01:54:46] to come up it became warm and then the heat became intense a typical you're never you can never just
[01:54:54] be comfortable it's always like freezing cold or too hot you would you he had 15 minutes where
[01:54:59] it was warm and then they were too hot there had been no firing for some time and I realized that
[01:55:04] the enemy was no longer with us scanning the countryside I could see burnt out cars Italian tanks
[01:55:09] and ammunition dumps the smell of burnt bodies and oil filled the air I was glad to move on
[01:55:15] such a confusion of our brigade such was the confusion of our brigade drop that come daylight
[01:55:22] three men from the men from three parah discovered they spent all night fighting alongside the
[01:55:27] men of first pair without realizing it at the bridge it was clear that there had been a fierce battle
[01:55:34] the pill boxes had been rushed and dealt with ruthlessly here the brigade mustard approximately
[01:55:41] 180 men but the three inch mortars in ammunition had not arrived and there was a lack of communication
[01:55:46] without side units wireless sets those are radios had been either incorrectly netted back in
[01:55:52] Africa were damaged on the landing or just did not arrive we learned that German parachutists
[01:55:58] from the third regiment of the first fallshemierger division had dropped simultaneously on our
[01:56:05] drops on the previous night so we must have indeed have brushed shoulders with them when we
[01:56:12] came upon that 50 man patrol how crazy is that you're jumping into a drop zone and the
[01:56:18] Germans are jumping in there too and then he grows as things start to escalate he's talking
[01:56:28] around how hot it was like hot as in not heat temperature but hot as in enemy action little
[01:56:36] wonder things were so warm the area within an approximately two mile radius of the bridge was
[01:56:41] festoon with 88 millimeter and 20 millimeter guns pill boxes machine gun pits and also a few
[01:56:47] coastal guns and we were engaging with crack German troop including pair troops they presented a good
[01:56:53] target whenever they got too near the bridge you could not miss but word run around that our supply
[01:56:58] of ammunition was now drastically low conserve ammunition in fire only when you are absolutely certain
[01:57:05] of a kill was the order but do in due course members of the first and third pair of battalions
[01:57:12] at the northern end of the bridge with Drew to join us at the southern end the enemy was getting
[01:57:18] harder to ward off as tanks and tanks began to appear now we got tanks enemy tanks on the scene
[01:57:28] we were using captured Italian 40 millimeter anti tank gun along with our own anti tank gun
[01:57:34] the battle worked up to a terrific climax the Germans were sending their best troops in an effort to
[01:57:38] shift us their pair of troopers probing for weak spots and allowing no respite food was in our
[01:57:44] haversax but there was no time to get it it was fire fire and keep on firing finally there was a
[01:57:50] wall at about 1830 or soon after giving us a chance to take stock maybe the Germans wanted to
[01:57:56] regroup I checked my ammunition and found only four rounds left plus one in the chamber
[01:58:01] at 1930 we were ordered to withdraw in order to avoid capture and go in small groups we made it off
[01:58:09] in a westernly direction toward the gona loung the gona lunga river if we could use the river
[01:58:18] and the road running parallel to it as a guide for a couple miles perhaps then we could be
[01:58:22] clear of any enemy concentrated attack so these guys are basically bagging out of the area
[01:58:28] and as they're doing their doing in small groups at one point as darkness fell we came upon a
[01:58:36] deserted farmhouse but decided not to enter as it was quite near an abandoned flat gun pit
[01:58:40] we thought both sides would be we thought both could be booby trapped it was approximately
[01:58:45] zero 200 by now we were very tired in hungry we dosed off in an orchard 20 feet from the edge
[01:58:51] each man at the base of a different tree so as to be less conspicuous so they spend the night in this
[01:58:57] orchard and then they set off once again we saw no more of the enemy via lentini
[01:59:08] we reached Augusta some 50 miles from Primisol Bridge finding the town in our hands it was a great
[01:59:15] site to see so many of our own troops and tanks and so they continue on reaching Syracuse without
[01:59:23] miss hop on this on the 17th of July just four days after dropping in Sicily we soon set sail
[01:59:30] arriving back at Sous in Tunisia on the 20th our first parachute brigade group had not only suffered
[01:59:38] heavily in the North African campaign but in Sicily too where we had lost a further 300 men killed
[01:59:45] wounded or missing it was time to rest refit regroup and reorganized and we also
[01:59:53] got to relax so I mean this this is a group of men that are now just hardened combat
[02:00:04] that's and yet there's no war there's no end to this in sight right I mean there's no end
[02:00:16] hey I guess if you looked at it from a strategic perspective knowing what we know today maybe you
[02:00:20] could say there's an end in sight but if you know you're barely surviving this you're barely
[02:00:26] surviving it you know what the end is I mean you have to accept what the end is probably in a
[02:00:31] big the end is probably gonna be you're not gonna live in early November we were told that the whole
[02:00:40] first airborne division was returning to England and the first parachute brigade would leave
[02:00:43] from Algiers at the end of the month on the 29th of September we shipped out of Algiers
[02:00:50] on the SS Samaria happily heading for Liverpool now one particular chap made a popular appearance
[02:01:00] Peter the battalions unofficial lovable dog Peter liked water and jumping from planes and was the
[02:01:10] only parachute dog on record at first he was owned by a lad named topor brown and rumor had it
[02:01:18] they had both escaped from Dunkirk in 1940 Peter was a marvel and could do almost anything
[02:01:24] asked of him never forgetting a trick put a stone on his nose and back away and he'd remain motionless
[02:01:31] but at a given command he would toss and catch that stone water was his god there had been static
[02:01:39] tanks eight feet deep at bullford into which a stone could be thrown Peter would retrieve it no time
[02:01:45] and then sit patiently waiting for another run when we had set off from North Africa in October
[02:01:52] the previous year he had been smuggled aboard the a run the castle everyone helping in the
[02:01:58] scheming to get him aboard and keep him fed exercised and comfortable he had been left behind in Algieria
[02:02:06] in the good care of the cooks and the rear echelon party when we went on to meet the enemy in
[02:02:10] Tunisia where topor brown was taken prisoner and sadly never heard of again
[02:02:18] corporal Jim Nash the battalion hairdresser of our company then took care of Peter
[02:02:25] and is it was at mate more in Algieria during training for the Sicily operation that Jim took him
[02:02:31] up for his first jump from an aircraft a special bag had been made who was fixed to Jim's front
[02:02:36] with a hole at the top for Peter's head to protrude they made a perfect landing Peter running off as
[02:02:44] happy as Larry wagging his tail after various other escapades Peter returned to Algieria's and was
[02:02:51] smuggled aboard the Samaria where he was having a great time until the locker door of his hiding
[02:02:58] place was accidentally left unsecured during one of our boat drill procedures and he ventured out on
[02:03:04] his own he was found wandering below by the ship's officer who ordered him to be put over the side
[02:03:13] we were just two days out from Liverpool the men were furious and it was just as well that the
[02:03:20] officer responsible could not be found as a roving band of justice seeking Paris could not have been
[02:03:25] expected to be lenient as far as Peter was concerned he had such enthusiasm for water that maybe
[02:03:34] he was fitting to end up in a sea grave but we felt as loss I don't mind admitting that we fighting
[02:03:41] men had a soft side even after all we'd seen and done perhaps especially after all we'd seen
[02:03:50] and done I wrote Peter a poem entitled Epitaph to a friend it's last verse as follows Peter made us
[02:04:03] happy and carefree he had no military apparel he made just two jumps his grave is the sea
[02:04:12] his wings truly earned and the name red devil kind of a theme that we see come up from time to time
[02:04:28] the attachment that soldiers can get to these to these dogs that they they come across at some point
[02:04:35] and unfortunately recurring theme is some rear echelon person doesn't understand killing those animals
[02:04:51] and I also thought it was you know it's interesting that line I don't mind admitting that
[02:04:55] we fighting men had a soft side even after all we'd seen and done and they says perhaps especially
[02:05:01] after all we'd seen and done that's something that is I mean I think that's absolutely true you know you
[02:05:10] there's no better there's the sunset looks a million times that infinitely better when you know
[02:05:16] the sacrifices that have been made to see the sunset the white bedsheets that you get to sleep on
[02:05:22] you appreciate infinitely more when you've been sleeping in the dirt for six months and it goes on and on and on
[02:05:29] then so when you see when you see the depravity that that human beings are capable of
[02:05:38] well that can actually expose the fact that you really can cherish all innocent
[02:05:46] let us in a little dog
[02:05:47] and these guys arrived back home get stationed the first battalion get stationed at
[02:06:06] Grim's Thorpe Castle and at this point they know something really big is in the air
[02:06:12] and he says here in August men coming from our old training area of Tatten Park
[02:06:20] reported seeing thousands of tanks there like a giant tank park sure enough in mid-September
[02:06:25] we were finally setting off somewhere I checked over my gear one gammon bomb two dot three six
[02:06:33] hand grenades combined pick and shovel webbing equipment with small pack two ammunition pouches
[02:06:39] and bandlear with three oh three ammunition water bottle mess tin iron ration field dressing
[02:06:45] camouflage net scarf triangle shape air recognition bright yellow silk scarf tied around the neck
[02:06:51] for ready for instant use rifle and an escape kit comprising of a silk map of Europe a small
[02:06:58] button compass and a strong file the size of a nail file that was about it except for a
[02:07:04] kit bag strap to the leg and parachute plus may-west life jacket in case we finished up in the
[02:07:09] drink I felt like an overdue pregnant hippo and didn't know where to put anything else
[02:07:15] though still I added 200 cigarettes two bars of chocolate and some boiled sweets
[02:07:22] it's interesting the yellow scarf for recognition and he specifically says tied around the neck for
[02:07:33] instant use and it's interesting we we kind of I always carried one the basic reason why I
[02:07:38] was carried one because I was a radio man when I was a young and listed guy and I used it at times
[02:07:45] I had learned the value of it signaling helicopters and signaling boats in the jungle like if you
[02:07:54] and the weird thing is you when you're in a boat let's say you're in a river along the jungle
[02:08:00] there's so much jungle to look at that it's really hard to see someone waving their hand like
[02:08:05] it seems so obvious when you're waving at some waving at a boat hey hey I'm over here the
[02:08:10] first of all they can't hear you because they're running engines shoot machine guns they can't hear you
[02:08:14] and second because they're looking at whatever quarter mile or half a mile of green
[02:08:21] bush they got this whole thing to try and find you and you're in a green camouflage uniform
[02:08:26] and you're waving your they can't see you so you need I would always have a aircraft panels what we
[02:08:32] call them aircraft sing with panel which is just bright fluorescent orange and I could whip that
[02:08:36] thing out really quickly and then it then you become a lot more visible same thing with the aircraft
[02:08:41] overhead well in a body it didn't take long before everyone was carrying that because and they were
[02:08:47] carrying big ones too like a platoon or like an element that was going in a building would have a
[02:08:51] big giant one that you could hang out a window everyone we are here hey friendly forces we are here
[02:08:58] so even this guy World War II that bright yellow silk scarf in important signaling device at the hand
[02:09:10] he says I I wondered how the rest of the men were going to fare on this hop
[02:09:13] I was just getting used to the new faces like Frankie Panzer Manzer Bill Silberry Terry Brace Dick
[02:09:23] Bingley Dolly Gray major parent brown Sid Oxley Guv Beach with his top hat the Germans
[02:09:35] will surrender in surprise if he takes him with that I thought Joe McReedy patty McCormick
[02:09:42] and Captain Joe Gardner that mean just I just had to read those names for two reasons number one
[02:09:51] because they sound like the best bunch of characters you could ever hang around and also so everyone
[02:09:56] remembers that all these people that we're talking about they're all people
[02:10:01] unfortunately sergeant Busty Everett had fallen ill and died at Born
[02:10:13] we were from all over the country and beyond and on the whole one big happy family
[02:10:19] it was daylight when we clambered into trucks and headed toward the arrow drone at Barxton Hall
[02:10:24] everyone was tense but ready to go come what may he goes on here our objective was to capture
[02:10:37] and hold the bridge straddling the rine at our nm my first parachute patty and was to seize the
[02:10:45] high ground to the north our escorting typhoon spit fire and Mustang fighters were weaving
[02:10:50] between the decodes and gliders as we cross the English channel tension began to mount in my
[02:10:55] plane we approach land on the other side and could see the area that had been flooded to try and
[02:11:00] stop her and peed the advance of our land forces i was admiring the landscape when the order
[02:11:05] rang out action stations hook up green light on go being number 13 night a few long seconds to
[02:11:13] wait as I shuffled forward then i felt a slight pat on my parachute back and again found myself
[02:11:18] tumbling out of the doorway into that familiar open void my parachute opened once more obediently
[02:11:24] and i drifted down to earth without difficulty after a good three point landing i was now an
[02:11:28] enemy occupied territory except for the occasional machine gun fire and some blasting from enemy
[02:11:34] machine gun placements the landing had been unopposed and the whole dropping north zone north of
[02:11:39] he'slam was packed with gliders and discarded parachutes everyone soon collected themselves
[02:11:45] and rendezvous to their perspective points the time was just after 1500 on Sunday the 17th of
[02:11:53] September 1944 the time was just after 1500 on Sunday the 17th of September 1944
[02:12:04] leaving the drops on we made a way quickly along the track running alongside the wood
[02:12:09] west of wolfhees and south of the railway the end of the track lined up with a road running parallel
[02:12:16] to the railway turning right here and then over the road onto the railway sidewalk we noticed our
[02:12:21] way toward wolfhees station suddenly there was a loud explosion up ahead and some machine gun fire
[02:12:31] and now this is when things start to get hot our company still upfront became engaged in a fierce
[02:12:41] battle facing armored cars, mortars and machine guns it was getting dark now the whole
[02:12:46] battalion laid doggo for a while to try to avoid further detection we lay up in the woods for
[02:12:53] some hours pushing on occasionally buck cautiously at one point in time unbeknown to the enemy they
[02:13:00] completely surrounded us in the semi dirt so here they are they're kind of like laid up they're not
[02:13:07] trying to move too much in the semi dark we passed down winding lanes this is when they start
[02:13:12] pushing forward through the woods and along the south side of the road we were now about five miles
[02:13:19] from the arndam bridge and so far luck had been with us at about two o'clock in the morning there
[02:13:26] were sounds a battle ahead apparently coming from an area north east north northeast of Lichtenbeek
[02:13:34] on arriving there at about 0-500 we found that the leading companies had met fierce opposition
[02:13:39] and it suffered heavily then with no reason given at the time the original plan to go for the
[02:13:46] high ground north of arndam was changed and we instead turned south towards marion doll
[02:13:54] an asterbeek some two miles from the bridge at 0-600 we entered asterbeek
[02:14:02] where we met members of the Dutch underground movement who showed us the easiest route to the bridge
[02:14:09] we were moving cautiously in a file ready for action and everything seemed a little bit too quiet
[02:14:14] at 0-630 as dawn was breaking we moved up into a built up area and then it started
[02:14:21] the enemy had been busy overnight preparing gun emplacements taking up positions at vantage
[02:14:25] points posting snipers and concealing tanks and SP guns German gunfire shattered the piece and I
[02:14:34] darted for cover and took up position in the neatly laid out garden of a nearby house
[02:14:38] more firing came from the house direction with two other men I ran around the back of the house
[02:14:43] and fired as two Germans in the shrubbery they must have had their chips with two other men
[02:14:50] I round around the back of the house and fired at two Germans in the shrubbery they must have
[02:14:55] had their chips amid the smoke and fire of machine guns SP guns and six barrel mortars the
[02:15:01] battle ranged the battle raged and built to such a pitch that I became quite accustomed to it
[02:15:08] and went about the task as if on street fighting training back in home we hadn't eaten since
[02:15:15] leaving England but I was too busy to be hungry casualties were mounting mounting incredibly fast
[02:15:21] and in every direction I could see motionless forms of our men cut down in their tracks
[02:15:26] progress was slow and the battle became more intense as the bridge loomed gradually nearer
[02:15:33] with two other chaps I did not know I chased after some Germans in a house
[02:15:37] we threw a grenade in and dashed to the door to finish them off with stand and rifle
[02:15:41] looking around for any more of the enemy we were built we built it to the rear of the house
[02:15:46] I tripped over a broken fence and went sprawling as I scrambled up I heard a close wine and
[02:15:51] recognized which I recognized was a mortar I die for cover by a low wall and the bomb landed very near
[02:15:58] near enough to feel the draft snipers were taking pot shots at us dodging and weaving through
[02:16:03] gardens and backyards I came to stop at an opposite of factory held up by held up by a heavy
[02:16:09] mortar machine gun fire yet again I threw myself into the ground it was absolute bedlam
[02:16:17] with the slicing sound of German southern solar their guns their bullets cutting their
[02:16:23] in every direction and the repeated spark of mortars followed by the wine and sound of hot
[02:16:30] shrapnel hitting the rooftops a small lump lump of shrapnel hit my helmet sounding like a pee on a drum
[02:16:38] in a heat of battle men were shouting curses lobbying grenades through open doors and windows
[02:16:43] and following up with shrieks of contempt for the enemy and a cry of woo hoo Muhammad
[02:16:49] casualties really began mounting there were groans from men who had been hit motionless perilous
[02:16:55] motionless perilous lay in the road and slumped over walls I saw a pair of feet protruding from a
[02:17:01] garden gateway one boat one boot blown off but leaving the foot complete such as the magical
[02:17:08] phenomenon of war the German fire power was murderous and all I could do was keep alert for the sound
[02:17:17] of English I had a horrible feeling that my battalion was being cut to ribbons going forward a
[02:17:28] little bit there was a heck of a battle going on inside the factory and men were scrapping
[02:17:32] furiously with grenade stins called handguns and fighting knives the wall of the house opposite
[02:17:38] received a blast of machine gun fire coming from behind me I was about to move off and pursuit of a
[02:17:43] German in the garden of a terrorist house on the on my right when I felt an explosion just beneath me
[02:17:51] and a sharp pain. Reeling over and looking down I saw that the lower part of my right leg was in a
[02:17:58] most unusual position and blood was oozing out steady and fast I shouted for help and two
[02:18:04] paras dashed up quickly and rendered first aid one of them sergeant knobby hall called for medical
[02:18:11] orderly I was worried but felt like a nuisance as everyone was busy enough already without being
[02:18:19] lumbered with me I was placed on a way I was placed on a stretcher and carried into a wooden
[02:18:25] shed a few yards away where medics cut the boot off of the foot of my shattered leg smashed by an
[02:18:30] explosive bullet it looked awful but strangely I didn't feel much pain they tore open the field dressing
[02:18:38] I had carried for so long in different parts the world but never previously needed and carried out a
[02:18:44] quick but thorough job pandemonium was raining outside as machine so at this point obviously he's been
[02:18:50] wounded he's been wounded really bad his leg is in very rough shape he can't walk pandemonium was
[02:18:59] raining outside as machine gun fire echoed around the built up area a mortar bomb landed quite near
[02:19:04] but the medic administrating a more-feet injection kept a steady hand as if he were in the safety
[02:19:11] of a hospital back in England so the talk about detaching the medic is just cool and calm
[02:19:20] while the other medic hunted around for suitable makeshift splint a young Dutch girl appeared
[02:19:24] from nowhere and offered me a welcome cup of water I was feeling cold and clammy and her help
[02:19:29] was a great comfort as was the morphine which soon began to take effect there was another series of
[02:19:35] explosions just ahead a clear signal to get moving and I was carried cautiously to the corner of
[02:19:41] a house next to the road I'd come down only a short while ago everyone was scattered
[02:19:48] everyone was scattered and there were dead paras in the road on the sidewalk and in the gardens
[02:19:54] snipers were busy and our men were bent on winkling them out there was a thud a whiz and a bark
[02:19:59] of an exploding shell followed by another and another all bursting on the rooftops of houses
[02:20:04] thirty yards back then something flash from an upper window only twenty yards ahead and bullets
[02:20:08] splattered on the wall above us the medic set me down to wait for an opportune met moment to get
[02:20:13] across the road and I saw four paras press themselves into the wall of the building opposite
[02:20:18] as they worked their way toward that flash went under the window the leading parac kick the
[02:20:23] door out and out of the window came a potato masher which he immediately picked up and threw back
[02:20:30] in the potato masher is the classic German grenade with a long handle on it which they did so
[02:20:37] that they could throw grenades as far as as the Americans could because we play baseball and they
[02:20:42] play soccer and you don't kick you don't kick grenades you have to throw them the leading parac
[02:20:50] kick the door and out of the window came a potato masher which he immediately picked up and
[02:20:55] threw back in a company by a mills bomb which is their grenade thrown by another man there was
[02:20:59] quite some explosion following which four paras entered the building spring stand gun fire in the
[02:21:04] room and threw up through the floorboards a trick we had learned in training I was more than
[02:21:12] relieved to get out of the line of fire was carried into the relative safety of a garden wall
[02:21:16] as I laid helpless behind the wall I had a clear view of the clatter and confusion in the battle
[02:21:21] and the through the demolished gateway so he goes on here obviously I'm not covering the whole
[02:21:29] book but covering some sections of things that are unfolding I was moved with a number of
[02:21:35] other wounded men to a nearby barn where I spent a fairly easy night thanks to the powerful effects
[02:21:41] of the morphine injection I'd been given early the following morning all was reasonably quiet
[02:21:46] in the immediate vicinity although I could hear the sound of battle not far off looking around the
[02:21:51] barn I didn't recognize anyone from my first paty and and those men I spoke to did not want to
[02:21:57] know they were either too preoccupied with their wounds or unable to talk at all some of them
[02:22:03] looked as though they had just lived through a nightmare which I would say is an accurate statement
[02:22:08] and again it's like everything that he's talking about is just you know complete mayhem combat
[02:22:21] that's what he's talking about it's just totally out of control and finally it settles down a
[02:22:25] little bit for that night and it sounds like maybe the probably the brits at that point
[02:22:30] it done a good counter attack maybe established a perimeter unfortunately doesn't last at about 0700
[02:22:40] two medics came up to me and said that my turn was next this is as they're trying to extract them
[02:22:47] lifting the stretcher they carried me to a waiting Jeep it's engine running there were
[02:22:51] four walking wounded in the back seat and I was strapped to the front of the bonnet alongside
[02:22:55] another chap who was already strapped in on the on beside the what windscreen he forced to grin
[02:23:02] what's yours I asked they got me in the guts he said bluntly that's a nasty place to cop it I
[02:23:09] thought feeling sorry for him a short stocky medic jumped in the driver seat saying hold tight
[02:23:15] in the back and don't worry you two in front on the bonnet we might have a rough ride and it will be a bit
[02:23:20] fast what do you even do I mean they take you they put you on a stretcher on the hood of a
[02:23:33] freaking Jeep and they're like and the medic says hold on to the guys in the back and says hey
[02:23:38] up front don't they've got them strapped down there's nothing they can do they can't move I wouldn't
[02:23:42] want to do that on a Tuesday afternoon you know going to like to the market I mean imagine
[02:23:49] I'm like hey I'm taking the market I put you on the hood of my car strap you down and say hey it's
[02:23:53] going to be a little rough. After a fast fast forward after a fast bumpy journey the Jeep
[02:24:02] tore through Usterbeek passed the net the original headquarters at the heart and steam hotel
[02:24:08] and pulled up sharply in the drive of the taffled berigo tell a few hundred yards farther on
[02:24:14] airborne medics quickly unstrap me and took me inside setting me down on the floor opposite a window
[02:24:19] in the entrance hall the hotel taffled berigo had been German field marshal walther model
[02:24:26] modells headquarters prior to our arrival the previous Sunday and we were now using it as an improvised
[02:24:32] military hospital it must have taken a few knocks as it was now in absolute shambles as usual
[02:24:39] the British Tommy had managed to brew up even in such hazardous conditions and I was given a mug of
[02:24:44] tea and a bar of chocolate my first foods in sleeping in England two days earlier I had not touched
[02:24:49] my ghastly iron ration I tried to sleep but with the interruption of shelling and mortar fire
[02:24:54] prevented that when night fell I just long for daylight to come again I hated the nights it was bad
[02:25:00] enough to be meeting angry Germans in battle but it was worse to do so while I slept the next day
[02:25:08] Wednesday I was grateful to be taken into the operating room ingeniously rigged up in the kitchen
[02:25:14] of the hotel so he gets some he gets some preliminary worked on on his wounds and of course the
[02:25:22] brits I know I've talked about this they like to brew up their tea and they will do it that's how they
[02:25:29] roll I was returned to the entrance hall where the den of battle embolitating the wall outside
[02:25:35] maybe look out I was surprised to be is to see a German wandering about so pictures is you're in a
[02:25:40] hospital you just got like the shrapnel cut out your leg they sit taken set you down and now you're
[02:25:45] watching the battle out of window and you see a German wandering around he took up a stand position
[02:25:52] by the door and then began pacing up and down just then there was a loud crump outside and debris
[02:25:58] plaster and glass fell all around I looked to see where that one landed and the German I had seen
[02:26:04] outside only a few moments ago was now sprawled out killed I presumed by one of his own mortar bombs
[02:26:10] but that should tell you with a situation there there's Germans outside the window walking around
[02:26:17] I was set down at the head of the stairs to my right leg glider pilot who had a face and arm injury
[02:26:24] amid all the wounded who covered most of the landing area came a wounded man walking our eyes met
[02:26:29] did I know him I hardly knew anyone they were unrecognizable clotted up with blood and dirt
[02:26:35] then up the stairs belted some combat paras and we asked them how it was going I had to
[02:26:45] had to capture this because this is just as british as it gets so these there's like we just said
[02:26:50] there's Germans walking around outside this places total shambles and they see a couple paras and he
[02:26:55] says hey how's it going and one of the paras answers not too bad not too bad could be a bit better
[02:27:02] before disappearing back down again that's like that's a no factor response yeah oh by the way
[02:27:10] we're about to get overrun but not too bad not too good be better but you know we got this
[02:27:18] fast forward a little bit a wounded man with his arm and a sling approached me with an inquiring look
[02:27:22] what unit chum he asked almost in a whisper first pair I replied I'm in a shower of dust and smoke
[02:27:29] as yet another shell exploded very near he went and withdrew from the direction of the shell blast
[02:27:36] just as we felt the ominous vacuum of warm air he was almost incoherent as he glanced around the
[02:27:42] terrible scene of man-made destruction I just left the bridge he said there was quite a pause what's
[02:27:49] it like there I asked he swung around glaring at me as if the whole war was my fault his eyes
[02:27:54] hard staring and red with fatigue the poor fellow had been hit through with something bad
[02:28:01] I offered him a cigarette and with a trembling hand he took one it hung limping his grasp
[02:28:07] thanks I don't really smoke but I'll have when he said then he answered it was bloody hell there
[02:28:12] tanks belching fire blocks getting killed left and right the carnage was terrible
[02:28:18] he paused as a medic passed by with a man clutching his side and hoveling on one leg a bloody
[02:28:23] congealed bandage wrapped around the stump where once had been a foot my lad drew hard on the
[02:28:29] cigarette and coughing continued there were hordes of them they went on for hours attacking
[02:28:36] shelling then the bastard started burning us out my two mates got killed the twisted and broken
[02:28:44] bodies of our men were strewn everywhere he leaned back against the wall looking a little
[02:28:49] mortise I don't know but I think it may have been the first I may have been the first person he had
[02:28:55] spelt out his experiences too they're he told me that it was his first time in action
[02:29:02] I thought he had ridden it bloody well the next few days seemed to drag on forever with my leg
[02:29:09] giving me much more pain now than it had during the first 24 hours after I was hit
[02:29:14] and so obviously these guys are rallied up and they're suffering but it doesn't mean that
[02:29:22] they're safe continuing on there are so many shells landing in on and around the building
[02:29:27] plus the occasional burst of machine gun fire spattering the inner walls that I imagine we
[02:29:31] must be slapped bang in in the front line or somewhere in no man's land by the way that's the
[02:29:37] field hospital there were hundreds of wounded in enemy included as well as Dutch people caught up in the
[02:29:44] fight so many that some got moved to the hotels and acts across the driveway and any man with
[02:29:49] flesh wounds or injuries that did not hinder the use of a firearm was ordered outside to fight
[02:29:56] so if you could fight now it's time it was now the 23rd of September and I was lying still
[02:30:03] at the head of the broad stairway and there was commotion down below those ruddy hunds again
[02:30:08] said the glider pilot there was a shuffling in German orders were being wrapped the out
[02:30:14] then some SS troops dashed up the stairs a sinister looking type about 20 years old led the way
[02:30:21] and was coming right out of it coming right at me I found myself looking straight down the barrel of his
[02:30:25] schmizer his trigger finger shaking I didn't bat an eyelid I just did not want to have set
[02:30:30] him and give him a cause to let rip he was glaring at me with red BDI's Christ this is it I thought
[02:30:37] I had heard of other wounded being shot up but my luck was in any past me by he and two other
[02:30:43] SS men had a good look around and took a and then took up firing positions at windows in rooms leading
[02:30:49] off the landing as they started to fire out Colonel Warwick dast up the stairs swearing and
[02:30:55] rebuking them for firing from a clearly marked red cross building discipline took over they look
[02:31:01] to find and so on but with fingers handling their automatic's hesitantly they reluctantly obey
[02:31:06] the officers command and stop firing so as I talked about early with the
[02:31:13] and clearly these are some Germans that have respect for the law of armed conflict
[02:31:19] and they there which let's just start with this we're in the hospital building and now we got
[02:31:24] the the Germans in the building using it as a firing position I don't even know what to say about this
[02:31:32] like what what is that even how do you even translate that into into reality your wounded your
[02:31:38] your hospital is getting mortar to machine gun and then there's German enemy soldiers in your
[02:31:44] building firing from inside your building walking around looking at you oh and he comments about this
[02:31:56] it was most strange to have enemy in the building one minute only be replaced by your own combat
[02:32:00] men the next so that's his statement about it is that yeah strange I wondered how the rest of
[02:32:08] my first parabatian were doing right from the Sunday night our our company had a tough time
[02:32:13] losing half of its men in the D lyridudal area then 40 men of six platoon as company were killed
[02:32:23] in two minutes on the approach to Archnem Arnhem and in the denbrink St. Elizabeth's hospital
[02:32:32] and factory area the rest of the battalion was badly mauled in the midst of it all father
[02:32:41] Benson a Roman Catholic priest was busy making his rounds and answering urgent calls
[02:32:48] one man so constantly needed things began to get on my nerves that morning
[02:32:57] which is kind of interesting because he's been through all this stuff he's wounded
[02:33:03] he's surrounded by the enemy he's on his whatever however many hundreds of days in close combat
[02:33:09] that he's been in over the past few years and now that he's wounded and surrounded and there's
[02:33:15] men screaming and dying all around them things are getting on his nerves a little bit this morning
[02:33:20] makes sense that's that's what that's what rages up to so things began to get on my nerves that
[02:33:27] morning what with the continuous den of battle outside in my leg getting more painful through lack of
[02:33:33] proper medical attention I called for father Benson to offer a few words of comfort so he came and put
[02:33:39] me at my ease later he was too as wounded by tank fire into the building I'm sorry to say that he
[02:33:45] died from those wounds and was buried in the grounds of St. Elizabeth's hospital on the following day
[02:33:54] the disposition was frightening once again under statement the British under statement because
[02:34:03] as far as I'm concerned everything up to this point is completely horrifying on the following day
[02:34:09] the disposition was frightening our men were still doing their damnness but the Germans were slowly
[02:34:15] closing in very slowly mark you for they lost heavily and had to fight for every inch of the
[02:34:20] bloody ground they got there with things getting hotter still I was moved again to what was thought to be
[02:34:28] a safer spot just to the other side and along the landing area suddenly there was an all mighty
[02:34:35] explosion in the room on my right men were already wounded once twice were hit again in somewhere killed
[02:34:42] there were pittiest cries coming from that room it was at this time that major John Wadi
[02:34:48] of the 156 parachute battalion who had started his parachute days in India when the battalion was
[02:34:54] first formed was wounded again and two English medics and a Dutch nurse were killed a medic now
[02:35:00] came out cradling a form in his arms the chapy carried could have been dead or unconscious
[02:35:06] he was covered in blood and his arm was shattered and hung prophetically by his side his left leg
[02:35:11] bandaged from his first wounding Christ I wish I were outside there was another resounding crash
[02:35:24] of bombs followed by curses perhaps I was better off in here it was bloody awful for everyone
[02:35:30] everywhere outside the situation was getting completely out of hand further enemy reinforcements
[02:35:37] were mustering around the perimeter in the form of powerfully armed tanks from the SS Panzer
[02:35:43] divisions with long barreled high explosives and armor piercing shells
[02:35:48] the passage where I lay ran from front to rear the hotel and I was facing the rear with a
[02:35:53] grandstand view of the battle through a gaping hole in the wall where once there had been a window
[02:35:58] now and again one of our men would break cover to stock the enemy and the enemy would repeat
[02:36:03] the process with the multiple accompaniment of shell burst tank fire machine gun fire curses and
[02:36:10] yelps of pain I heard the ominous sound of an approaching tank I couldn't see it but the
[02:36:18] squeaking of its caterpillar wheels grew even louder then it came into view it's great gun
[02:36:24] traversing from right to left picking its way through the trees it stopped for a few minutes to
[02:36:31] feel its way and then the gun barked out sending a shell across my front to an unseen target
[02:36:39] the other wounded were lying huddled together trying to afford each other protection
[02:36:44] the floor was littered with debris blood and glass and there was an incest and wind and explosion
[02:36:49] of mortar bombs together with the shrieking crash of artillery vibrating the very foundations of the
[02:36:54] building which I thought when it's some point tumbled down I don't know what time it was when the
[02:37:00] shelling and gun fire stopped but after a den of the last six days it felt very strange to suddenly
[02:37:07] be so much quieter there were still spasmotic firing in the distance and a little shelling
[02:37:14] but nothing to worry about we began to converse more freely gone on strike Jerry one man almost
[02:37:21] shouted except that his head half his mouth bandaged from a shell splinter wound nah he's packed
[02:37:28] up as Jerry and buggered off a cockney put in the glider pilot was more cautious crafty saw
[02:37:34] is the hunt he's got something up his sleeve then I saw men being carried downstairs with great
[02:37:41] activity going on outside but not of battle two medics picked me up both of them silent and not
[02:37:49] looking to please where to now I asked the Elizabeth hospital one told me the enemy had overrun us
[02:37:56] and was calling the shots so the Germans were now in control he gets taken out south outside
[02:38:12] was a ghastly site with the fallen dead of both our sides lying where they had gone down
[02:38:19] British and German medical orderlies were putting the wounded into jeeps and various other vehicles
[02:38:24] including two small vans improvised as makeshift ambulances three of us stretcher cases were
[02:38:30] loaded into a small open German lorry with shallow sides which would prevent us from bouncing off
[02:38:35] and transit there was just enough room for five walking wounded now they're on this drive we all
[02:38:45] had shattered bones of some sort which made us cry out and pain during the rough ride in this
[02:38:50] antico anticoated lorry and I was still more than pleased when it finally came to a stand still
[02:38:56] at journeys end at the hospital there had clearly been heavy fighting and as spent cartridges could
[02:39:01] see be seen littering the floor and entranceway I heard that familiar voice of a friend what the
[02:39:08] hell are you doing on that stretcher scrounging for a lift I went to answer but nothing came out
[02:39:14] can you imagine you go to the hospital and the floor has got bullets chasing all over it
[02:39:25] word got around that the whole show was over and I began to wonder what really went wrong
[02:39:30] the battle had been lost but it had been some fight as mortar sergeant Dick winning him later
[02:39:36] Riley remarked we may have lost the battle at our nm but we did come in second it should be noted
[02:39:44] that there had not only been a great loss of life in this battle but also massive local
[02:39:49] destruction with one or one in four houses totally destroyed in most of the remainder badly damaged
[02:40:02] and so again you know I talked about the scene the different sides of the Germans and you know
[02:40:08] we already saw some of the Germans the prisoners being second by what the kind of civilian
[02:40:14] casualties were taking places they evacuated done Kirk the the Germans that were firing inside
[02:40:19] the hospital and then when they get told by an unarmed you know leader hey get out of here there's
[02:40:24] okay fine they're grumpy but they leave just the fact that these the patients are the wounded are
[02:40:32] getting treated actually pretty well so they end up in this sort of makeshift hospital
[02:40:41] South African orthopedic surgeon captain Alexander Lippman castle was going to see me
[02:40:47] he commanded one of the surgical teams of the 16 pair of field ambulance I was thankful that I was
[02:40:51] not going to have a German butcher I had seen the end result of a German doctor's amputation of a
[02:40:57] man's foot crudely almost guillotine and without anesthetic I was carried into a large room with
[02:41:02] medical apparatus everywhere trowlies and tables laden with all sorts of instruments bandages field
[02:41:07] dressing in splints I was placed on a hard narrow table about four feet from the ground in the distance
[02:41:12] I could hear the sound of gunfire and German flock which meant that our aircraft were in the vicinity
[02:41:19] the anesthesiists put up had his needle at the ready and medics were preparing for the operation
[02:41:24] when there was a noise rather like a giant balloon having air released and then a terrific explosion
[02:41:31] with a very quick presence of mind one medic threw a blanket over me and shielded me from the
[02:41:35] blast with his own body as shattered glass fell in small pieces and slivers all over the operating theater
[02:41:43] then all went quiet again and the blanket was pulled carefully to reveal yours truly with popping
[02:41:49] eyes my treatment had to wait another day while the place was cleaned up
[02:41:52] fortunately for me the next visit was uninterrupted the wound was cleaned and redressed
[02:41:58] and I had my first plaster cast put on and so like I said it seems like at this point it's
[02:42:05] it's relatively civilized I mean if you can forgive a bomb exploding while you're about to get surgery
[02:42:12] but relatively civilized compared to what they'd been through at one point there's an SS officer
[02:42:18] comes in and they kind of go through the different individuals there and they finally get to him
[02:42:24] and when he tells him he's an airborne guy they say you're going to prison a work app
[02:42:31] and he says here was September 28th there was a 28th of September when German orderly
[02:42:36] he's carried me out of the hospital not so carefully as our own medics and I had to hang on
[02:42:40] to the sides of the stretchers we descended the stone steps at the entrance to avoid sliding off
[02:42:44] and now he gets transported again this time he ends up at the Villem 3 concern barracks
[02:42:58] we were given iron beds with straw filled pillows and the floors were dirty there was no
[02:43:05] heating and only a meager supply of medical necessities and then at one point a doctor or or
[02:43:12] I presume he was entered the room accompanied by a rotten fear of the SS medical corps the stench
[02:43:21] from my wound caused disapproval on the face of the doctor and grabbing my big toe with his finger
[02:43:27] he slowly raised the leg which began to bend at the wound beneath the knee were both the
[02:43:32] Tibia and Fibia were broken stopping he peered at the wound inquisitively
[02:43:37] D-Mind that hurts I told him where upon he simply released the hold of my leg and let it fall in the
[02:43:42] hard table instantly turning to go looking at me in the eyes with his statistic expression as he did so
[02:43:51] you bastard square headed shite hawk I said I couldn't care less if he didn't understand the phrase
[02:43:58] he just raised an eyebrow with an inquiring looking departed while I returned to my private world of pain
[02:44:03] then the medics came back with that infernal SS guard and redress and repostured my leg
[02:44:14] so like I said there's I mean it's not great treatment but I mean let's face it he's alive
[02:44:20] and he goes on here I was at the barracks for a little more than a week
[02:44:24] when one morning I was prepared for yet another move this time a short journey to the juliana hospital in
[02:44:31] apple doom apple dorn my stay at juliana hospital is going to be the longest and best as far as
[02:44:39] medical care goes go the hospital staff with Dutch doctors and nurses helped by our own doctors
[02:44:44] and orderlies and the Germans left us well alone to fend for our own medical requirements
[02:44:50] like I said that seems fairly civilized to me and they're trying to help him out and here we go
[02:44:58] it was decided to apply a gadget called a Kirchner wire extension to my leg as both bones were broken
[02:45:03] below the knee the theory was to stretch the leg and try to marry the bones in the correct position
[02:45:08] under an injection of evapand a steel bar was shot through my ankle bone to act as an anchor
[02:45:15] a steel cable was then attached to the anchor and to a pulley apparatus below the foot of the bed
[02:45:20] weights were added each day to steadily stretch the leg otherwise I was told I would be left with a
[02:45:26] two inch shortening necessitating the use of a club boot at a later date which I didn't much
[02:45:32] care for but my general condition my general and local condition had regressed considerably
[02:45:38] and I was at my lowest ab I was now wishing that I could see the end of this confounded uses
[02:45:47] lump of decaying flesh and bone on the 19th of November I got my reluctant wish and my leg was
[02:45:55] amputated by major Peter Smith of the 133rd parachute field ambulance as I later learned it was
[02:46:03] not a moment too soon prior to the operation I had been regarded as a hopeless case one of those
[02:46:09] certain of not lasting after surgery however I made such an amazingly quick recovery that I was
[02:46:17] back to life and sitting out of bed only a week later the medical orderlies could not do enough for us
[02:46:23] from baste of fetching bed pants carrying patients from the bed to the loo and back again soothing
[02:46:29] and dying soothing the dying or reading a book for those two weeks are exhausted to do so for
[02:46:34] themselves they were always on call all hours of the day and night I wondered when they managed
[02:46:40] to eat or sleep I asked one who was passing with a bottle in his hand he answered quite cheerfully
[02:46:46] oh we get forty winks now and then with snack in between so there you go I mean almost one sentence
[02:46:56] no two sentences he was wishing that he could get this decaying hunk of flesh off of his body
[02:47:05] and the next time the next sentence is got reacted that's that's that's how much
[02:47:10] that's that's that's that's that's been as matter of fact as you can get I guess is what I'm going with this
[02:47:27] this is a one last little section of this a Polish parah who had dropped at Arknem
[02:47:33] was opposite me in the corner of the world he'd been caught up badly and was having a rough time
[02:47:38] a German military clergyman kept calling to say prayers and finally came to administer the last
[02:47:43] rights as he stood there in his dark olive green uniform black jack boots and belt
[02:47:50] peaked cap under his arm I scrutinized his close cropped bull neck and square jaw I could not
[02:47:56] help a notice and thought how strange that he wore a gunholster a man of the cloth with a pistol
[02:48:03] in a hospital what next so he talks about you know the care that he gets he starts getting moved
[02:48:16] around a lot the Germans kept shipping us out as soon as they thought we were fit enough to travel
[02:48:19] and once again I found myself in a truck this time heading to the rail station at Apple Dorn
[02:48:25] where we pulled up alongside of and boarded red cross train and of course this stuff just never
[02:48:32] gets easy daylight came with a German doing is nut and shouting spit fire actone spit fire actone
[02:48:39] I watched a lone spit fire turn and fly parallel to the train at about a hundred feet with the same
[02:48:43] distance from the train it was quite cheeky I thought the pilot was having a real close look to
[02:48:49] make sure it was a hospital train I could see clearly as goggles were off in white scarf
[02:48:53] and felt like giving him a wave as he disappeared behind some pine trees we were now in Germany with
[02:48:59] snow-covered mountains and forests of fur log cabins dotted here and there making it also pitch
[02:49:04] a risk as nightfall came we halted at a dismal looking place a small town I think unfortunately
[02:49:11] the luxury was now over and we were ushered off the train in a collection on a collection of
[02:49:18] crutches of varying lengths that were produced and given to the leg amputees so they get end up in this
[02:49:26] like just junk place we were all a bit under the weather with the added unpleasantness of an
[02:49:33] amputation one lathe and arm and a hand missing another two arms off and most like myself had lost
[02:49:41] the leg one poor fellow was the worst for blisters on his one and only foot we had a wounded medic
[02:49:47] who was with us and did all he could to help with medical minimal medical supplies we had only paper
[02:49:53] bandages it was not the best of nights on the cold stone floor but I somehow slept others were
[02:49:58] not so first fortunate and one chap did not even live to see the rest of the journey remaining
[02:50:03] motionless the next morning as we were roused by the guards so this transport continues gets on a
[02:50:11] train finally ends up at another place the snow is quite thick we pulled in what looked like a
[02:50:19] school in a small town near Munster three of the yanks of myself were told to get out and then
[02:50:24] a lorry carried on its way leaving a standing in the crisp snow a voice called welcome buddy come in
[02:50:31] he's a big American from Indiana called Marvin Adams inside he showed us to a room on the left
[02:50:38] grab yourself a pillow and bed down here I'll do yours bud he said looking me up and down
[02:50:46] how'd your manage that fella put the best foot forward at the wrong time I answered
[02:50:52] oh well the St. the Ritz but will have fun he said I wonder what he meant by that
[02:50:58] always good to be that person with a good attitude we even when you're an adam prisoner of war camp
[02:51:07] going on here the Germans guards were not existing except at night
[02:51:12] as we were all severely wounded there was thick snow outside they were obviously not worried about
[02:51:16] a massive scape food was sparse but regular and then again more moving I was just getting used to this
[02:51:27] place when word went round that Jerry was moving us some of us maybe for repatriation
[02:51:33] having only one pin meaning leg I thought I stood a good chance to be in on this then early one
[02:51:38] morning three yanks two Russians in myself were ushered to a truck and taken on a passenger train
[02:51:44] in which we travel the few miles only to detrain again perhaps to get another connection
[02:51:48] for as our yet for our as yet to be undisclosed location destination
[02:51:56] and then they get off that train they get on another train they get on this other train
[02:52:02] after shunting around a bit and hitching up to another train we rolled off again it was dusk
[02:52:08] cold and pretty dimo all told then someone struck up our version of the song bless him all
[02:52:18] and their version of the song was salt them all salt them all belong in the short and the tall
[02:52:24] salt all the sergeants and the W.O. ones salt all the corpus and their bastard sons
[02:52:31] for we're saying goodbye to them all as back to their billets they crawl you'll get no promotion
[02:52:37] aside of the ocean so cheer up me lads saw them all and he says it seemed we had joined a group of
[02:52:46] British soldiers by this was by way of an introduction they finally make it to bremen
[02:52:58] we pulled in slowly and as the train came to a stop there were sounds of doors opening in the
[02:53:02] hustle and bustle of people getting off and making their way along the platform and then it happened
[02:53:06] an air raid warning wind out civilian military personnel immediately began scurrying about in the
[02:53:11] military I noticed did not hesitate to shove anyone else out of their way a little shot at the
[02:53:17] German military the civilians are getting pushed out of the way so they can get to cover
[02:53:23] the air was humming with aircraft american Boeing b-17 flying fortresses and our guards
[02:53:28] quick in their step way ahead of us periodically turning to beckon us to hurry it up
[02:53:32] we entered the shelter being enough for about a hundred people and after a lot of pushing and
[02:53:37] shoving settled among amid the gliers and remarks thrown our way I was happy to let it happen
[02:53:42] but somehow I'd been pushed and guided into a corner of the shelter away from the door if a bomb
[02:53:47] lands two near the the Germans take it blast take the blast and cushion any effect on us I thought
[02:53:54] there was a wooden batch fixed to the wall I dropped to it exhausted three guards it spread out between us
[02:53:59] and other occupants and when the bombing started in earnest the shelter shook I was sure
[02:54:05] wanted landed close outside because I felt it's draft reminding me of being blown off my feet
[02:54:10] in North Africa only that time it was just 50 feet away everyone fell silent as the drone of
[02:54:15] aircraft and wind and crash a bombs went on with ever increasing ferocity for a good hour before
[02:54:22] dying down to a steady drumming and an occasional distant explosion I must admit I always think of
[02:54:28] these bombing runs as taking like maybe 10 minutes but we're talking about a good hour
[02:54:40] people began to chatter this is once everything's kind of faded people began to chatter
[02:54:45] as interfered dispersed and external barvato took over I could hear the gnashing of teeth
[02:54:51] glances accompanying finger pointing in our direction the crowd is getting rest if in a big
[02:54:56] man started pouring forth with words of abuse a big frow about 40 years old worked her way near
[02:55:03] to us until she was only a couple feet away I felt the murt moisture of her spiddlesty argued with
[02:55:08] the guards about the privilege we had being allowed to be in the same shelter as the German people
[02:55:13] I gathered that was a crux of the matter that was the crux of the matter at this point a heavy
[02:55:18] booted foot came out and started propelling my way I parried firmly with my right hand and the boot
[02:55:24] just brushed my balls coming to a harmless glancing blow on my left thigh the guards stood firm
[02:55:30] restraining the woman and trying to calm everyone down it was only then that I noticed
[02:55:36] a familiar sound in French our guards were Frenchmen constricted in the German army
[02:55:44] anyway they saved my nuts from being cracked there must have been another hours wait at the
[02:55:51] station another back going to transfer again there must have been another hours waited the station until
[02:55:56] I an old army type lorry with solid tires turned up or sorry they were waiting for truck
[02:56:03] I couldn't care less at this stage provided I didn't have to hobble on crutches before long
[02:56:07] I saw the large POW camp ahead with its eight foot high wire fences and guards platform
[02:56:12] sticking up like store thumbs all around there was a collection of dingy looking huts dotting the interior
[02:56:18] the lorry slowed at the gate and the senior guard jumped down through the hand to go through the
[02:56:25] handing over ceremony then the big wood and wire gates creed open and the lorry jerked into the
[02:56:31] compound where out we tumbled I was exhausted and sweating as if I just come out of a Turkish bath
[02:56:39] my stump was throbbing I stayed lying on the ground where I landed managing to support myself on
[02:56:44] one elbow while the rest of the party sat knelt or remained standing with the aid of their crutches
[02:56:51] I didn't want a welcoming committee but wished that someone would show us where to go
[02:56:55] one of the guards was busy having a chat and laughed with his mate eventually he gave us the go ahead
[02:57:00] and the party moved off slowly and weirdly I found myself left behind I tried to get up but I could
[02:57:04] not muster enough strength to make it so I started crawling dragging the crutches
[02:57:08] I'd only manage five or six yards when I heard voices and saw two pairs of gated boots come
[02:57:14] come on me old mate a voice said we'll give you a lift on which they lifted me with ease and
[02:57:21] carried me I don't know how far I didn't even get a glimpse of their faces to say thanks
[02:57:28] sinking down onto a straw mattress I just slept and slept for the next two days when I woke
[02:57:34] I found that I was in Stolog X1B in Saxony along with a large number of other airborne men
[02:57:42] it was not long before I contracted more complaints to add to my already sorry condition
[02:57:48] Lysen bugs were in abundance in my hut the nights were the worst the iron stove was stoked right
[02:57:54] up at night and the heat was awful with all the doors and windows shut tight urine buckets
[02:57:59] would fill to the brim and no time making the stench nauseous I went down with dysentery
[02:58:04] plurzy and scarlet fever which together with my amputation meant that I did not feel all that good
[02:58:13] red is hard as nails if I had wanted to die I would have but fortunately that didn't enter my head
[02:58:24] little key note as I read that I thought hmm let's think about that
[02:58:31] if you want to die if you want to give up you there's the time but luckily fortunately for him
[02:58:38] that thought did not enter his head after a short time promising news
[02:58:43] again I'm jumping ahead like this is what we're talking every little thing that he just talked
[02:58:48] about is a nightmare and he's got him all at the same time it's been a while since we talked about
[02:58:55] lice on the podcast yeah we've been missing out on that one we think lice is no big deal
[02:59:03] because your kid gets it and then you get some special little medicine from the store and then you put
[02:59:07] it in their hair or you shave their head and and either way prom solved these guys are got it
[02:59:15] and there's no way to get rid of it this is by the way wall that got dysentery and plurzy
[02:59:23] and scarlet fever and an amputation however fast forward a little bit after a short time promising
[02:59:33] news I was told that I was going to be repatriated I boarded yet another train no sooner than we
[02:59:37] set off that there was a terrific woosh in the train stopped in the middle nowhere I could hear the
[02:59:41] gutteral tang twang of German civilians as they ran hell for leather on each side of the train
[02:59:46] to take cover from what must have been our own aircraft overhead one of the guards just
[02:59:50] the moose and left it to us looking down to the track I saw that it was much too high for me to jump
[02:59:54] with only one leg the some of our party of eight jumped and took cover I found my pants and don't
[03:00:02] know whether it was fright or the dysentery that was still with me the planes returned they were
[03:00:08] to rocket firing RAF typhoons which specialized in ground attack I recognized the sound as they
[03:00:14] got nearer there was another woosh and then another followed by an ear splitting explosion
[03:00:19] the carriage shook so violently that I thought we were going to topple over as always in such a
[03:00:24] task it was over in no time with such a tax it was over in no time and all of a suddenly peaceful again
[03:00:33] so they have to go and repair this train and then finally we had reached a snug little village
[03:00:37] called Myzberg on the German side of the border with Belgium and once again we see some nicer
[03:00:46] treatment our first job was to be cleaned up and we were taken in pairs into the shower I was
[03:00:50] asked to remove all personal items from my pockets and all clothing was to be cleaned and few
[03:00:54] amigated don't worry you'll get everything back and English medic told me here put this on it was
[03:00:59] a sort of cotton smock which tied in the back was just long enough to cover to the knee first in
[03:01:03] came a great big American with the same garb with forms like tree branches he lifted me bodily with
[03:01:10] the ease of samps and himself mind you I was down from 14 stone to just over eight since last
[03:01:18] September and to translate that into American English he weighed 196 pounds in September and now
[03:01:26] he weighs 112 on reaching the shower is made ask can you stand on one leg bud sure I said
[03:01:36] samps and it taken his smock off and proceeded to bathe me while herkilly steadyed me I was carried
[03:01:42] back to a most luxurious bed with white sheets God knows where the when they scrounge the sheets
[03:01:48] but trust the yanks there were approximately 40 wounded there a mixture of English French and
[03:01:53] American with four American and two English orderlies one of the walking wounded act that is a
[03:01:59] cook all the others doing menial tasks they did not mind though so he's in this pretty
[03:02:07] car can I even say let's say let's just say and improved situation and improved situation is what is
[03:02:14] he and that goes on a little bit or even he calls it the luxury things began to live in
[03:02:24] up outside the rumbling in the distance grunier and groups of bejragled weary looking Germans
[03:02:31] plotted through the village the wounded born by horse and cart field guns were manhandled
[03:02:37] the luxury of any motorized transport being afforded to senior officers only who clearly
[03:02:42] wished to withdraw in his dignified manner as possible leaving hunter officers to do all the
[03:02:50] donkey work along with the shoots and and suffer all the humiliation of being seen by their own
[03:02:56] countrymen it was a pathetic sight like a cutting from the first world war film archives as the
[03:03:03] dawn approached the throb of motorized transport and tanks was very near so he's seeing the Germans
[03:03:11] kind of walking back he's seeing the officers in the vehicles the German officers in the vehicles
[03:03:16] and the German troops walking or being carried if they were wounded and years tank activity right
[03:03:26] which is kind of an indication where you have tank activity but you see people withdrawing with horses
[03:03:30] and garages that's an indication that perhaps the tanks that we're hearing are good friendly
[03:03:37] as dawn approached the throb of motorized transport and the tanks was very near
[03:03:41] you could hear the squeak of the tanks wheels rubbing against the caterpillar track
[03:03:45] thirsty for lubrication edging and shunting into position for the impending advance in the village
[03:03:53] that noise that a tank makes in the city is just wind well who is the awesome
[03:04:01] and and it's also horrifying like these guys when they're hearing the German tanks outside when they're
[03:04:06] in that that battle whether about to be overrun the horror can't even imagine of tanks coming
[03:04:13] and now the joy which I got to experience some of the joy in the body of hey the tanks are coming
[03:04:18] it's glorious and god bless the tankers and here these guys feel in the same way the American
[03:04:25] orderlies were jubilant they're here lie me the yanks are here exploded Hank anyone who get up walk hop
[03:04:32] or propel themselves in some way momentarily forgot their wounds in discomfort they peered
[03:04:37] through the cracks and the doors through the windows I could not see anything from my window
[03:04:41] only the Nazi flag of the local garrison hanging listless like the enemy itself
[03:04:46] bill one of the english medics came gashing and not knowing which way to turn in his excitement
[03:04:51] there's hundreds of them there's hundreds of tanks out there bloody well hundreds of them
[03:04:55] Sherman tanks of general patterns armored division had encircled the village in the early hours
[03:05:03] of that morning and were in a very advantageous position as we were in the valley and they were on the
[03:05:08] high ground every gun would have its own selected target with orders to open fire if fired upon
[03:05:17] thankfully the tanks played a waiting game with the non-existent enemy because the because unknown
[03:05:23] to the Americans the birds had flown an American scout car ventured cautiously toward
[03:05:30] the village on molested it reached the outskirts scanning the bridge buildings where white flags were
[03:05:36] protruding no sign of the enemy still in view of the tanks on the hill it became bolder and
[03:05:43] crews gently into the village our makeshift hospital with a painted red cross on the roof
[03:05:49] must have been in view of the scout car now all these goings on were being shouted by one of the
[03:05:56] medics in the passageway for the benefit of all those like me who could not see for themselves so he's
[03:06:00] getting a play by play the scout car came to a stop it's occupants clutching their automatic
[03:06:08] at the ready they must have spotted someone step carefully into view that person was a medic
[03:06:15] with a red cross arm band Hank the orderly from Ohio he was about a hundred yards from the
[03:06:21] scout car and they stealthily approached each other Hank not wishing to be mistaken for a German
[03:06:26] ruse though in the scout car not wishing to fall for any trick as they drew closer the realization
[03:06:36] dawned that they were brothers a wireless call was immediately sent to the tanks on the skyline
[03:06:43] and in minutes the village was alive to their rumble as they thundered on through leaving an
[03:06:50] accurate smell of oil and exhaust fumes I was almost home
[03:07:04] and you know I got to that point in the book and I was like well that's that's where you stop
[03:07:08] and it's definitely a good place to stop but let's take that as a stop
[03:07:20] that incredible glory of seeing the Americans seeing patents armored division rolling
[03:07:31] and knowing that he was almost home
[03:07:33] but there are some things to think about and he covers them in the epilogue here he says the
[03:07:42] casualties in the arnum area alone were eight thousand airborne killed the wounded captured
[03:07:49] or missing including poles plus more than four hundred RAF pilots in crew
[03:07:57] there were 750 Dutch civilians and underground fighters killed at least two thousand five hundred
[03:08:06] Germans and in the following winter of 1944 to 1945 some 200 thousand Dutch died of starvation
[03:08:16] so it's so it's important to understand that these you see you see this through one man's eyes
[03:08:24] but that thousands in fact hundreds of thousands were affected by this particular battle
[03:08:36] and again that might be a good place to stop but there's another note here he talks about
[03:08:40] several years later I visited the place of thinking if you will of that great man and founder of
[03:08:47] the parachute regimen Winston Churchill the war rooms situated far below ground at the
[03:08:56] treasury chambers in Westminster the existence of these a war in room war in of rooms was a well kept
[03:09:04] secret during the warriors the tour was fascinating everything remained exactly as it had been back
[03:09:09] then I sat in Churchill's chair in front of me on the desk printed on a black card
[03:09:15] printed in black on a card the words of Queen Victoria in this house we never speak of defeat
[03:09:31] in this house we never speak of defeat and he goes on in the toilet there was a red telephone
[03:09:37] a direct line to President Roosevelt in Washington in the visiting ministers room I opened a
[03:09:44] book entitled World War II on the Sicily landings and saw a training shot of members of my 11th
[03:09:52] S.A.S. Battalion to the four in the lineup were Harry Bance Corporal Hudson Jimmy Metcalf
[03:10:03] and myself
[03:10:04] down here beneath Westminster I surrounded I am sure by a dedicated team Churchill did his job
[03:10:18] extremely well I would like to think that I did my best alongside other leopards,
[03:10:26] lions and tigers of the first parachute brigade and again I really didn't get into the fact that
[03:10:44] at some at one point there there are call signs their code names had been the leopards lines and
[03:10:49] tigers that's what their the different battalions were called could be a good place to stop on
[03:10:57] a goal a little bit further this is actually in the preface of this book and he says when the war ended because
[03:11:02] this is he survived he was home when the war ended I found it a little difficult initially
[03:11:12] knuckling down to civilian life the letter from the government saying you are now a civilian
[03:11:18] seemed so sudden I couldn't face the prospect of an office job so I tried manufacturing making
[03:11:29] handbags before joining my brother-in-law John in his landscape gardening business and then
[03:11:34] branch branching out on my own in the same line of work having an artificial leg didn't help
[03:11:41] but I didn't let it hinder me then the limb fitting center at gilling him kindly reinforced
[03:11:48] my artificial knee for kneeling several times I got a BSA motorbike and side car and had the gear
[03:11:59] is modified to operate by hand instead of foot I built my own house you do the best you can
[03:12:11] again again I mean hey found a little rough to guess what I'm gonna go I'm gonna go to work
[03:12:25] I'm gonna start a business I'm gonna build a house I'm gonna drive a motorbike around the
[03:12:29] country with a side car you do the best you can and I also wanted to say that he wasn't alone
[03:12:46] he obviously need that side car for someone and I'm quite sure that that was one of the
[03:12:52] dedications of the book is for Betty Francis Regis wife who who as he puts it helped me so much
[03:13:07] and the last thing I'll say the last thing I'll read from this book I should say is the
[03:13:16] dedication and he says I dedicate this book to all my airborne friends who never came back
[03:13:38] whose actions made it possible for me and other airborne friends to enjoy over
[03:13:45] 70 years of living and that is well that's the parts I'm gonna read from this book but
[03:14:02] um red shirt is died on January 29th 2016 94 years old
[03:14:20] he was the last surviving member of the original first parachute battalion the last of
[03:14:27] those initial 500 men that took that step forward and volunteered for parachute and command
[03:14:35] no training in 1940 in the book the book which is called the memory indoors the book it's actually
[03:14:46] not available on Amazon it's not available in book stores I actually got it I got it from somebody that
[03:14:52] sent it to me and with no inscription in it it says he sent me a note it says dear jacco
[03:15:01] keep up the great work best wishes I believe it says Rick or Rich so that's where I got the book
[03:15:10] from luckily it was sent to me I wouldn't have known about it otherwise if you want to get this book
[03:15:16] which you should it's available from pilots publishing dot co dot uk and there's also a Facebook page
[03:15:25] the memory facebook dot com slash the memory indoors and as it says in the book
[03:15:33] the authors royalties in respect of this book will be donated to the parachute regiment charity
[03:15:48] and there you go another hero teaching us the sacred lesson that we must never forget that
[03:16:01] life is a gift and as rich Curtis tells us what you do with that is you do the best you care
[03:16:19] you do the best to that you care and with that echo echo Charles as I decompressed over here
[03:16:28] a little bit maybe got some ideas of how how we can be the best we can use what do you got for us
[03:16:37] I one of the many things that I took was I don't know if it was his attitude or if that's the
[03:16:47] culture or both you know could be a bit better and then that was the other guy right who was like
[03:16:53] could be a bit better do we do better yeah so on these terrible conditions right could be a bit
[03:17:01] oh oh you talk about the guy that says not too bad not too bad could be better could be better
[03:17:09] so you know like I said probably probably both right attitude plus culture so the attitude right
[03:17:16] one things when you go through adversity you can have that attitude not too bad not too bad could
[03:17:23] be better hey we're about to get overrun and there's a strong possibility we're going to get
[03:17:28] killed right not too bad not too bad could be better yeah could be better positive thought pattern
[03:17:34] there yeah it's kind of like well it's really a good news bad news yeah it's also a realistic view
[03:17:39] right yeah hey I'm still walking hey I still got ammunition yeah and by the way it's not not too bad
[03:17:45] means we don't have to do anything could be better though maybe there's some things we can work on
[03:17:50] yes yeah well I forget what movie it was when he's like I got good news and bad I think
[03:17:55] I'd been tango and cash I don't know maybe maybe not but anyway he said how are good news and bad news
[03:18:01] it was what's the bad news we're almost almost out of gas and he's like well what's the good
[03:18:06] news we're almost dead again so sad it's too good man so just you know speaking of attitudes good
[03:18:13] and bad what we're doing one of the many things is jujitsu okay so that's a really good news bad
[03:18:19] news scenario as well really what's the bad news bad news is you're gonna get choked
[03:18:26] from time to time I know this firsthand that's that's the bad news but the good news is you are
[03:18:34] exposed to an environment that will teach you how to choke others if the need may arise
[03:18:42] good yes so good news is you're getting choked are sorry bad news is you're getting choked
[03:18:49] yes good news is you're getting choked which means you're learning how to defend also choke
[03:18:54] of the people yes so if we're competitively well that could be good or bad news whatever
[03:19:00] so it's a matter of your attitude really how is your attitude like the on getting
[03:19:05] choked you know a lot of learning you know not a little learning what do you call it when you
[03:19:10] relearn something you know lessons lesson repetitive repetitive learning sessions hey it's not any
[03:19:17] not a new population you know it's repetitive well it is it's both I imagine that you get choked one
[03:19:21] time you'll never get choked again no no that's not the one that happens with the jujitsu so we are it
[03:19:27] sounds like jujitsu even though there's a negative possible thing right but it's not too bad not too bad
[03:19:34] it could be better if you try it yes start training the more you train the better you get so there you go
[03:19:41] anyway well we're training we're going to need a geek cause you're going to do geek what do you
[03:19:44] do not do geek well I guess that's possible but okay I'm not recommended no no I recommend
[03:19:49] are you going to fight people all the time that are just wearing shorts no no what if you get
[03:19:54] in a street fight okay if you get a street fight at the beach maybe what if you get a street fight
[03:19:59] at the supermarket yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you were taking the last you
[03:20:06] know and really that's like that's the last one you were broccoli yeah you don't like that you
[03:20:13] gotta fight them for something like this but that's even just one of the actually teeny tiny way
[03:20:18] of looking at it where it's like okay oh I see you're saying because the chance of you getting
[03:20:23] in actual fight are pretty low.
[03:20:26] If you're still trying to get a point,
[03:20:28] not to say that you should, not, you know,
[03:20:30] I'm not saying that, but they're pretty low.
[03:20:32] This is what I'm saying.
[03:20:33] And especially if you're gonna avoid
[03:20:35] getting a new fight, if you're smart,
[03:20:38] you're smart, yes.
[03:20:38] The problem is you can't always avoid it.
[03:20:40] You can maybe a situation and here's the deal.
[03:20:43] If you are forced into a situation
[03:20:46] that where you have to defend yourself
[03:20:48] and you don't know how the result is catastrophic.
[03:20:51] You have to be catastrophic.
[03:20:52] Why have that catastrophic possibility?
[03:20:55] Here's the deal.
[03:20:57] If that's the only reason you were training GJ2,
[03:20:59] if that was the only reason, it would be worth it.
[03:21:02] If that was the only reason, here's the deal.
[03:21:05] That's not the only reason.
[03:21:06] There's a thousand other reasons.
[03:21:08] There's an infinite more reasons, right?
[03:21:11] You're gonna get better conditioning.
[03:21:13] You're gonna get mental stimulus.
[03:21:15] You're gonna meet other human beings.
[03:21:17] You're gonna develop relationships and have friends.
[03:21:20] You're going to think you're gonna develop discipline
[03:21:24] in your life, right?
[03:21:26] This is a long list.
[03:21:27] I mean, this goes on.
[03:21:28] So even if the only thing you were gonna get
[03:21:31] was just you learn how to defend yourself.
[03:21:34] Totally worth it.
[03:21:35] Now not only are you gonna get it to defend yourself,
[03:21:37] you can be able to get these other collateral bonus things.
[03:21:41] Which by the way, some people in order to work
[03:21:44] their cardiovascular system,
[03:21:45] their ride in a spin bike somewhere.
[03:21:48] Someone else in order to work their flexibility
[03:21:50] is doing a yoga class.
[03:21:52] Someone else in order to work their strength
[03:21:54] is lifting some weights.
[03:21:56] I'm not saying, I'm not saying to go do all those things.
[03:21:59] But I'm saying you can get all three of them
[03:22:01] like a little hitter of all three of them.
[03:22:04] No problem.
[03:22:05] Get on the GJ2 bats.
[03:22:07] Yeah.
[03:22:07] Guy, nogie.
[03:22:09] Both of them.
[03:22:10] Yes.
[03:22:11] Well, yes.
[03:22:13] But if you're doing Guy only because someone
[03:22:16] on the street might be wearing certain types of clothes.
[03:22:19] Same exact point I just made.
[03:22:23] Yeah.
[03:22:24] If you're only going to do Guy because of that,
[03:22:27] it's worth it.
[03:22:28] But there's all these other beneficial things.
[03:22:30] Yes.
[03:22:31] And I'll tell you this right now.
[03:22:32] Really the number one thing that'll keep you in GJ2
[03:22:35] doing it, the number one thing.
[03:22:36] And it's maybe even by far for most people
[03:22:40] is that it's fun.
[03:22:41] I was gonna say fun.
[03:22:42] It's great.
[03:22:42] I hope we're aligned with this.
[03:22:44] To you.
[03:22:45] It's true because look, think about it.
[03:22:47] Oh yeah.
[03:22:48] I'm gonna do GJ2 for self defense.
[03:22:50] Oh yeah.
[03:22:51] That's the answer.
[03:22:52] When I started GJ2, me, when I started I was like,
[03:22:56] I'm just gonna do good enough.
[03:22:57] You know, so I can handle myself.
[03:23:00] Which is like I said about six months period.
[03:23:02] About six months, if you're an aggressive guy
[03:23:04] and you're a good athlete or strong or whatever,
[03:23:07] six months you're pretty good to go.
[03:23:09] Right?
[03:23:10] Six months of GJ2, you know what's up.
[03:23:11] It's been 20, whatever years.
[03:23:13] You know?
[03:23:14] Yeah, exactly.
[03:23:15] Right.
[03:23:16] So, oh yeah, don't, I mean, and if you tap someone out,
[03:23:20] try the first time, the first time you tap someone out.
[03:23:22] Then say like, oh yeah, that's the first time.
[03:23:24] Yeah, that's, I made that up, by the way.
[03:23:26] You're trying to impinge on my statement.
[03:23:29] Well, you might have made up saying that maybe bringing it
[03:23:32] to light, but the fact is true.
[03:23:35] So you're saying that I only quoted like a universal truth.
[03:23:39] Yeah, you know self-evident.
[03:23:41] I don't know man, because people used to ask how long
[03:23:45] should I train for?
[03:23:46] Or I had no.
[03:23:47] I mean, we got the question on the podcast.
[03:23:49] How long should I really don't like it?
[03:23:50] And the answer was, at first, like, well,
[03:23:52] you should try it for six months, oh, three months.
[03:23:53] Whatever, no, no, no.
[03:23:54] They train until you tap someone out.
[03:23:57] I don't want to use the term in anger,
[03:23:58] but you tap someone out for real,
[03:24:00] it is just you training environment.
[03:24:02] Yeah.
[03:24:03] And then you're good.
[03:24:03] Yeah, you're right.
[03:24:04] That was the specific answer.
[03:24:06] So yeah, that is yours.
[03:24:07] Okay.
[03:24:08] I'm just making sure, because I'm over here wanting full credit.
[03:24:10] That's not the last.
[03:24:12] If you're training, it just for us.
[03:24:13] If you were to set it in not such a way,
[03:24:17] like the way you set it, man, you thought you set it
[03:24:20] as if you just created like E equals NC squared over there.
[03:24:24] You like you should train until you,
[03:24:25] you were looking down your nose as you said it as if.
[03:24:29] So I had to call you out on that one.
[03:24:31] There my little bro's you go.
[03:24:32] Oh, good.
[03:24:33] I was just remembering the other day.
[03:24:35] Well, the Austrian guy that came came Kurt.
[03:24:37] Is his name?
[03:24:38] Kurt, yeah.
[03:24:39] Young Kurt.
[03:24:40] Yeah, so I asked him.
[03:24:41] I was like, Carl Longing been training.
[03:24:42] He said like a month or something.
[03:24:43] Like some kind of kind of new, really new.
[03:24:45] And so I said, have you tapped anyone out yet?
[03:24:47] And he said, yes.
[03:24:48] So like, all this guy's in the game, I knew her, Eddie.
[03:24:52] So maybe I kind of drew from that recent experience
[03:24:55] to, you know, to kind of say it.
[03:24:56] But in the last, like I was saying, if you train,
[03:24:59] only for self defense, only for self defense.
[03:25:01] Not because it's fun, not because it's a good workout,
[03:25:03] not because you got into a bunch of new friends,
[03:25:06] not because all this stuff.
[03:25:08] Only for self defense after a while, not even a long while
[03:25:11] after a short while, you can be like, I don't even know
[03:25:14] I'm doing it like, I'm not even, I'm not using it
[03:25:16] to defend myself really.
[03:25:18] Yeah, you know, because those are kind of rare, you know.
[03:25:20] And then you might not do it, you know, especially in the
[03:25:22] not fun.
[03:25:22] So there you go.
[03:25:23] And fun people, like there are people who
[03:25:26] train you just to for decades, literally decades that
[03:25:29] have never got in a fight before.
[03:25:31] Never got in a street fight, never got in it like a physical
[03:25:33] fight.
[03:25:34] So it's like, yeah, are they trained for self defense?
[03:25:36] Yeah, sure.
[03:25:37] Of course.
[03:25:37] But that's not why.
[03:25:38] Why?
[03:25:39] That's not why they're in the game.
[03:25:40] Yeah, exactly.
[03:25:41] So nonetheless, when we do it like I said, do the
[03:25:44] ghee, this can be one of it.
[03:25:45] The other part, it's no game.
[03:25:46] When you do get a ghee, you get an origin key.
[03:25:49] Yeah, 100% 100% best geese by far.
[03:25:53] So, factually.
[03:25:54] Now, same type of thing.
[03:25:56] If you're going to get an origin key, just because you
[03:26:00] want the best ghee, that's good.
[03:26:01] That's a good.
[03:26:02] That's our good reason.
[03:26:03] Like that's solid.
[03:26:04] Right?
[03:26:05] That's my reason.
[03:26:06] If you peel back the layer a little bit and you want to
[03:26:08] find out what else you're going to get, well, what
[03:26:10] else you're going to get, you're going to get the fact that
[03:26:12] you are literally rebuilding an industry and a
[03:26:17] community and an economy inside of America.
[03:26:23] You know, that's a little, that's not even a little bonus.
[03:26:26] Like there's some people that would look at that and say,
[03:26:28] I'm going to buy an origin key just because of that.
[03:26:30] Yeah.
[03:26:31] And then if I even do, you get to that sort of second
[03:26:34] thing.
[03:26:35] Yeah, I can do it.
[03:26:36] Now, if you're feeling it, let's say you're feeling it.
[03:26:39] You're feeling that part.
[03:26:41] You're feeling like America, you're feeling the economy,
[03:26:44] you're feeling the community, you're feeling the industry,
[03:26:46] you're going to bring it back, you're going to help.
[03:26:48] But you still haven't gotten over the hump of showing
[03:26:53] average of your kids to school.
[03:26:55] But you still want to support it.
[03:26:57] It's OK.
[03:26:59] It's, we'll say, I step in the right direction.
[03:27:01] We have genes that you can get.
[03:27:04] You can get genes.
[03:27:06] You're still going to help those other three.
[03:27:07] I would prefer the first thing that you get.
[03:27:10] In all seriousness, the first thing I would prefer you get
[03:27:14] is a geek because that tells me you're going to get on the map.
[03:27:16] If you, if you, because so many people,
[03:27:19] and you know what, every, well, you know what, 99% of people
[03:27:21] say when they finally start due to it,
[03:27:23] I wish I would have started, well, when I first
[03:27:26] this, blah, that's what people say.
[03:27:29] Tell you this.
[03:27:30] I'm meeting people now that are purple belts that started
[03:27:33] due to when they started listening to this podcast.
[03:27:35] So where about probably three to four years away
[03:27:39] from having somebody that started you
[03:27:40] to listen to this podcast will be a black belt in GJ2,
[03:27:45] which is an awesome achievement.
[03:27:46] Here's the thing.
[03:27:48] There's also people that will say I started listening
[03:27:51] to podcast in three years when I'm by before I started.
[03:27:54] You could have been a purple belt.
[03:27:56] Don't wait.
[03:27:56] I'm telling you right now.
[03:27:58] Like, I'm telling you right now, start your GJ2.
[03:28:02] In fact, I'm telling you that.
[03:28:04] And by the way, we touched on a little kind of combatives,
[03:28:09] hand-to-hand combat in this book.
[03:28:10] All right.
[03:28:11] And there's a whole line of a whole thread we can pull on that
[03:28:16] and we will at some point the British combatives program
[03:28:20] World War II, very cool.
[03:28:23] I've done a read a bunch about it and we'll dig into it here
[03:28:27] because it's pretty awesome.
[03:28:28] The way they were doing things, their concepts, et cetera.
[03:28:33] But if they were alive today, they'd be loaned
[03:28:37] the GJ2 all day.
[03:28:40] Yeah.
[03:28:41] And they'd be getting American geese even from England.
[03:28:45] They'd be like, you know what?
[03:28:46] Those GJs get to yank.
[03:28:48] Get yourself a yanky geese.
[03:28:49] Right?
[03:28:50] Because again, really the primary reason is because it's
[03:28:53] factually the best one.
[03:28:54] Yeah.
[03:28:55] Same thing for jeans where I would say,
[03:28:58] since I got my pair of origin jeans, which is like,
[03:29:03] oh, I'll go when you think about it when they came out.
[03:29:05] So while I go, I have not worn any other jeans ever.
[03:29:08] No.
[03:29:09] Yeah.
[03:29:10] Why would you, why would you do that?
[03:29:11] No, there's not even a reason to do that.
[03:29:13] There's not even a reason.
[03:29:13] I only have one pair too.
[03:29:14] Or I don't have three but, unless that's the only ones I wear.
[03:29:19] Also, they, we have other stuff here at origin.
[03:29:22] We do.
[03:29:23] So yeah, joggers, you know, more athletic wear,
[03:29:26] all kinds of good stuff.
[03:29:27] You go to originmain.com main like the state.
[03:29:31] Also supplements, keep yourself in the game.
[03:29:34] Yep.
[03:29:35] Propel yourself further down the path.
[03:29:38] Yep.
[03:29:39] As it were.
[03:29:39] Yep.
[03:29:40] Get yourself.
[03:29:41] Joint warfare and Krooile.
[03:29:43] Out of the gate.
[03:29:45] Once again, and I feel bad because I did this on social media.
[03:29:49] Where the guy was like, hey, what can I do to help?
[03:29:51] And I was like, I, I didn't want to be that guy.
[03:29:54] That was like, well, you know, here,
[03:29:56] try my supplement line.
[03:29:57] You know, I just don't, I just don't want to be that guy.
[03:30:00] And then later I felt bad.
[03:30:01] I was like, I should have just been straight up and said, hey, listen, man,
[03:30:04] do whatever you want to do.
[03:30:05] Get yourself some Krooile and join warfare immediately.
[03:30:08] Order that.
[03:30:09] Oh, what?
[03:30:10] You're 36 years old and you fail in sore and you're doing it.
[03:30:13] And you're at, I think I was literally asking me how my joints are.
[03:30:15] I didn't say it.
[03:30:17] Because I don't want to be that guy.
[03:30:19] Yeah.
[03:30:20] Right now I'm being that guy.
[03:30:21] You know what guy I'm being?
[03:30:22] The guy that's actually trying to help people.
[03:30:24] Because I didn't help that guy as much as I could have.
[03:30:26] I should have said, listen, do what I, you know, be consistent.
[03:30:28] Don't take big chunks of time off.
[03:30:30] Order a Krooile and oil.
[03:30:33] Join warfare right now.
[03:30:34] That's what you have to do.
[03:30:36] That's my recommendation.
[03:30:37] I feel bad for not doing that.
[03:30:38] I will try not to make that mistake again.
[03:30:41] No, I had the same experience.
[03:30:43] I went on with Pete and Brian hands in daylight.
[03:30:46] Okay.
[03:30:47] I did an episode with him recently.
[03:30:49] And he was, and Pete was saying, oh, yeah, you're like durable.
[03:30:52] Because I don't have like ailments.
[03:30:54] You know, Pete's jammed up his back.
[03:30:55] Yeah.
[03:30:56] This is like, you know, we're, I'm older than him actually.
[03:30:59] And he's like, oh, yeah, you're durable.
[03:31:01] You know, and I was like, yeah, I mean, because I never thought I was durable at all.
[03:31:06] Like, that's actually being hanged out with me.
[03:31:09] Yeah, exactly.
[03:31:11] But I was pretty fragile to be honest with you.
[03:31:13] It's fine.
[03:31:14] You guys might, because you know what Pete said to me?
[03:31:15] Like, when he was just out here, he was like, you're, he told me I was durable.
[03:31:19] Well, you're, you're.
[03:31:20] So I figured that you guys had that conversation.
[03:31:22] Because I said, that's what I call told me one time.
[03:31:24] Anyway, you told me, when you told me that,
[03:31:25] they've been like, it, when you told it to me, it had been like you had been contemplating
[03:31:29] it for quite some time.
[03:31:31] You were like, you know what I figured out about you?
[03:31:32] And I was like, what?
[03:31:33] And you said, you're durable.
[03:31:34] Yeah, like a tank.
[03:31:35] I was like, that's interesting.
[03:31:36] And I had to kind of agree with it.
[03:31:38] Yes.
[03:31:39] And so he said that I was durable.
[03:31:41] And I was like, well, and we even said, no, jocals durable.
[03:31:44] I don't, and then, but then, I guess on in a way, yeah, because you're, you're, you
[03:31:48] bounce back from some pretty solid.
[03:31:50] Pretty solid.
[03:31:51] You know, how many new surgeries you had?
[03:31:53] One knee surgery, but if you need injuries, plus my loose knees, I know.
[03:31:57] I know.
[03:31:58] I know.
[03:31:59] They're loose for real.
[03:32:01] Anyway, so they pop out all the time.
[03:32:03] That means what I'm saying, you know, and they'll get more and more squats.
[03:32:06] I'd decide to do the process.
[03:32:08] And how's this?
[03:32:09] I do do squats.
[03:32:10] And actually now, I go deep like all the way down like you.
[03:32:14] Yeah.
[03:32:15] Oh, yeah, that's the reason.
[03:32:16] And how's they feeling tighter?
[03:32:17] No, no.
[03:32:18] Great.
[03:32:19] I mean, same.
[03:32:20] No, they still pop out in jiu-jitsu.
[03:32:21] Like when I do better, like, anyways, it doesn't matter.
[03:32:22] The loose, clinically, the doctor, orthopedic surgeon told me that.
[03:32:27] Anyway, so anyway, I don't feel like that.
[03:32:30] I don't feel like that.
[03:32:32] Anyway, given the circumstances, yeah, I guess I am pretty durable.
[03:32:37] But anyway, the point is we're talking about this stuff.
[03:32:39] And then, like, I'm like saying, like, oh, yeah, plus, I don't take time out of it.
[03:32:43] And then I'm naturally going into plus to take during more fair, or everyday, like, religiously,
[03:32:48] you know, so it's basically the point was to say you got to actively be durable, you know,
[03:32:54] kind of thing.
[03:32:55] Oh, yeah.
[03:32:56] But they're not like purely genetic apparently, right?
[03:32:58] Increase your durability.
[03:33:00] Also, we got other stuff.
[03:33:02] We got discipline go in a can, which is just awesome.
[03:33:07] It's awesome.
[03:33:08] No sugar.
[03:33:10] It tastes delicious.
[03:33:12] It has some caffeine in it.
[03:33:15] It has some, it's got some other things in it.
[03:33:17] But it's got a little kick that goes with it.
[03:33:20] Same with the discipline powder, which is what I drink pretty much all the time.
[03:33:23] It's almost, it doesn't have too much caffeine in the discipline powder.
[03:33:27] It's got like 15 milligrams, a scoop, which is not crazy at all.
[03:33:31] It's a micro dose, even if you have two scoops.
[03:33:35] What's that?
[03:33:36] 30 million, you know, 45 million grams for three scoops.
[03:33:37] It's not that big of a deal.
[03:33:39] But taste delicious has some other ingredients that give you a little.
[03:33:44] Do you?
[03:33:48] Protein, the form of the dessert.
[03:33:51] For adults and kids, even though it's like sure the kids are going to drink the regular
[03:33:57] milk and let's face it.
[03:33:59] The adults are going to drink the word.
[03:34:01] Kid mobs.
[03:34:02] So much where your kid mock, I'm surprised I haven't turned gone down in age.
[03:34:09] The less those are there too.
[03:34:12] And they taste insane.
[03:34:14] That's the thing.
[03:34:15] So that's that.
[03:34:17] Also, Jocquay T. And by the way, right now, this all these supplements that you might
[03:34:24] want to try are available at the vitamin shop nationwide.
[03:34:31] Everyone that's been going out and buying stuff there, it's pretty cool.
[03:34:33] Appreciate it.

[03:35:14] pair.

[03:36:00] And by good reviews, I don't mean, hey, it's a great podcast.
[03:36:03] I probably like the insight that, no, I mean,
[03:36:07] reviews that are, let's just say there's, they've got layers.
[03:36:10] layers.
[03:36:11] Fun, colorful.
[03:36:12] Color, they make me laugh, they make me chuckle.
[03:36:14] I'm sure.
[03:36:15] Don't forget about the ground in vodka.
[03:36:17] So shines a good deed, you know, weary world.
[03:36:24] Yeah.
[03:36:25] Sorry, I don't know.
[03:36:27] I don't know what you have in scene, Willy Wonk and the chocolate factory lately.
[03:36:32] No, to be, I don't think of seeing no one in any of them.
[03:36:35] I saw part of the Johnny Depp one.
[03:36:37] No, I part of it.
[03:36:39] Fowl.
[03:36:40] Well, thank you.
[03:36:41] You got to watch the original one.
[03:36:42] It's awesome.
[03:36:43] It's a great movie.
[03:36:44] All right.
[03:36:45] Well, interesting.
[03:36:47] That's interesting.
[03:36:48] Jock, you heard it.
[03:36:49] Jocko.
[03:36:50] Watch that.
[03:36:51] We, Lee Wonkka and the chocolate factory isn't awesome.
[03:36:53] Yes, it is an awesome movie.
[03:36:55] Okay.
[03:36:56] Oh, go watch it.
[03:36:58] Amen.
[03:36:59] Maybe I'll look into it.
[03:37:00] Maybe he'll watch a report back.
[03:37:02] Less grounded podcast.
[03:37:04] I mean, I'm over here throwing out quotes from the movie, right?
[03:37:07] We're doing Shakespeare.
[03:37:08] We're doing, we're doing the memory endurance, but we're also throwing out some Willy
[03:37:12] Wonkka.
[03:37:13] Charlie and the chocolate factory.
[03:37:15] Sure.
[03:37:16] All right.
[03:37:17] Well, there you go.
[03:37:18] It will make sense.
[03:37:19] Anyway, like I'll say, I'm grounded podcast as a podcast about life.
[03:37:23] Jiu-Jitsu.
[03:37:24] Life.
[03:37:25] Life.
[03:37:26] Jiu-Jitsu is infused into life.
[03:37:29] Or is life infused into Jiu-Jitsu?
[03:37:31] Both.
[03:37:32] More important, I think life is reflective of Jiu-Jitsu and Jiu-Jitsu is reflective of life.
[03:37:37] So if you can learn from one, you will learn about both, which is important.
[03:37:42] It's true.
[03:37:43] Not quite as often as chocolate podcasts, but it's out there.
[03:37:46] So, which is weird, because it's like really hard to make this podcast.
[03:37:49] It's really easy to make a grounded one.
[03:37:51] But you know what we do?
[03:37:52] We do the hard things.
[03:37:53] Yes.
[03:37:54] That's what we focus on.
[03:37:55] Prioritize.
[03:37:56] Prioritize.
[03:37:57] And what is the second part?
[03:37:59] In the way.
[03:38:00] In the way.
[03:38:01] You know what's just got a knife in the drum, bro?
[03:38:02] Oh, so warrior kid podcast, which is a good one for the young trooper, warrior
[03:38:09] kids.
[03:38:10] And don't be shy if you're a parent to listen, because you're in a learn.
[03:38:14] I wish I would have that podcast as a parent when my kids were young.
[03:38:17] Actually, in a way, it's a parent podcast.
[03:38:19] It is.
[03:38:20] It is.
[03:38:21] It is.
[03:38:22] Yeah, because you know, like, when you hear of certain people's childhoods, for whatever.
[03:38:28] Like, certain like people who are like successful in XYZ, whether it be athletes, whatever,
[03:38:32] right?
[03:38:33] And you learn about their childhood.
[03:38:34] You could probably learn some solid stuff like, oh, I just just had one model.
[03:38:38] Yeah.
[03:38:39] Let me try to, you know, start incorporating it.
[03:38:40] Yeah.
[03:38:41] Yeah.
[03:38:42] So let's do the work.
[03:38:43] If I can say it's all in there.
[03:38:44] Yep.
[03:38:45] Speaking of warrior kids, don't forget about the warrior kid soap at IrishOxoranch.com.
[03:38:51] And actually right now live.
[03:38:53] Live is a new.
[03:38:57] Is it model?
[03:38:58] What's it called?
[03:38:59] A new model.
[03:39:00] It's not flavor because you don't eat it.
[03:39:02] It's a new.
[03:39:03] It's a new.
[03:39:04] I didn't even know.
[03:39:07] No, it's a new.
[03:39:08] Come on.
[03:39:09] I'm thinking of regular soap.
[03:39:10] So, you know, like, I don't know what do they say.
[03:39:12] It's a new version.
[03:39:13] Right.
[03:39:14] We have a new model, a new version of soap.
[03:39:18] You have actually have to check it out because it's so legit.
[03:39:22] It's called, well, what it does.
[03:39:24] Let me tell you how much it does is it's got some.
[03:39:27] Anti-microbial.
[03:39:28] Anti-microbial.
[03:39:29] I think it does.
[03:39:31] It's got some anti-fungal natural elements to it.
[03:39:38] One of those elements is like it's got like tea tree oil.
[03:39:41] It's got activated charcoal.
[03:39:44] And what's cool.
[03:39:45] So, this is what's cool.
[03:39:46] So, first of all, the soap is called killer soap.
[03:39:50] That's the name of the soap.
[03:39:51] But what, it couldn't be any more perfect because it is because of the charcoal.
[03:39:57] It's black.
[03:39:58] So, it's black.
[03:40:00] And it's awesome.
[03:40:02] So, get yourself some killer soap from IrishRokes Ranch.com.
[03:40:05] And by the way, this is a kid that's making it.
[03:40:08] A kid that started a company and pitched me.
[03:40:11] You know what stuff I get pitched?
[03:40:13] I get pitched up five times a day.
[03:40:15] I get pitched something, this, that, and the other.
[03:40:17] This kid pitched me.
[03:40:18] But, you know, he pitched me.
[03:40:19] He's like, hey, I'm already rolling.
[03:40:21] Yeah.
[03:40:22] You know, I'm already rolling.
[03:40:23] I'm already making soap.
[03:40:25] By the way, I'm 10.
[03:40:26] I've got a soap production line.
[03:40:29] And I've got vertical integration.
[03:40:31] I mean, he was getting after it.
[03:40:33] Yeah.
[03:40:34] So, he hasn't even pitched me.
[03:40:36] Pitched me.
[03:40:38] And of course, he didn't even pitch me by, could you, I know, he was like, I want you to know
[03:40:42] what I'm doing.
[03:40:43] There are openings if you would like to get a piece.
[03:40:46] Yeah.
[03:40:47] I'm like, you know, and you invest in the people, right?
[03:40:50] I'm looking at a kid that's 10 years old that's sending a business plan, that's sending
[03:40:54] samples.
[03:40:55] What do you like?
[03:40:56] So, anyways, we went deep to cover the grappling and just the luck.
[03:41:01] Look, there's nasty things in the world.
[03:41:04] And if you want to, you can get some killer soap, and that will help you as a person

[03:42:02] It is.
[03:42:03] Maybe.
[03:42:04] How many times was that funny?
[03:42:05] I don't know, but it wasn't more than 29.
[03:42:07] It's only funny.
[03:42:10] It's only funny.
[03:42:11] You say it because it's so hard.
[03:42:12] I don't know.
[03:42:13] I can't even say it anymore.
[03:42:14] Yeah.
[03:42:15] Because it's worn out, bro.
[03:42:17] So just note, no more.
[03:42:18] No stop.
[03:42:19] No, it is.
[03:42:22] Also, don't forget about psychological warfare.
[03:42:25] Little psychological hitter.
[03:42:29] And I actually had the person point out to me.
[03:42:32] Hey, that was me.
[03:42:34] Now, so that's one.
[03:42:35] I also had the person point out to me that there was a name for the type of shooting that
[03:42:39] we talked about, which is where you're shooting at where things are.
[03:42:41] You think things might be.
[03:42:42] It's called Drake shooting.
[03:42:44] And the dude is like a he's a guy that's on Twitter who always brings up good
[03:42:49] points.
[03:42:50] He does his own personal research on stuff.
[03:42:52] But he's got a weird handle that I can't remember what it is ever.
[03:42:57] I recognize it in the heartbeat.
[03:42:59] I know I can tell you all the kind of things.
[03:43:02] So anyways, I apologize for not telling you that Drake shooting appreciate the info.
[03:43:05] He's always got a good info.
[03:43:07] But the psychological hitter with someone that's realized that that's what psychological
[03:43:10] warfare is.
[03:43:11] It's not some broad course on how to have more discipline in your life.
[03:43:17] It's just a little bit of a hitter in case you need it.

[03:44:14] I appreciate it.
[03:44:15] Or your kid one, two and three, probably the best kids books that you can get right
[03:44:23] now in my opinion.
[03:44:24] I'm biased.
[03:44:26] But I'm only biased because I read them.
[03:44:29] And I think, man, the lessons in these books.
[03:44:33] I wish I knew them.
[03:44:35] I wish I knew them.
[03:44:36] So warrior kid books one, two and three, way the warrior kid marks mission.
[03:44:39] And where there's a will, Mikey in the dragons, if you got a little or kid.
[03:44:44] Want to learn one of the most important things that you can learn as a kid is how to overcome
[03:44:47] fear that book shows you how to overcome fear.
[03:44:50] Discounted groups freedom, field manual, get it so that you can read two pages.
[03:44:57] Read two pages.
[03:44:58] Okay, you know, let's say we made up a pill that you could take this pill and you would
[03:45:03] get a mind shift.
[03:45:05] Like a positive way.
[03:45:07] Like you would.
[03:45:08] If you took this pill, you would increase your discipline.
[03:45:11] And factually, okay, would that pill pill sell well?
[03:45:15] Would people want it?
[03:45:16] Yes.
[03:45:17] Okay.
[03:45:18] Read two pages of this book.
[03:45:19] You're discipline will increase.

[03:45:24] Yeah.
[03:45:25] Increase in discipline.
[03:45:26] Well, read two pages.
[03:45:29] Well, in the defense of the pill people, pill advocates, the whole purpose of a pill is
[03:45:36] so you don't have to do any kind of work or read or do all this stuff.
[03:45:39] Okay, so okay.
[03:45:43] Two pages of this book is not an extended period of time.
[03:45:46] You're finishing this in less than four minutes.
[03:45:49] Oh, so right.
[03:45:50] So this book essentially is the pill of books.
[03:45:53] So you know, instead of like the encyclopedia set of books.
[03:45:58] Okay.
[03:45:59] We'll take it.
[03:46:00] It's a rough lose analogy.
[03:46:02] Not sure.
[03:46:03] Not 100% I'll think of something.
[03:46:05] Thank you through that one.
[03:46:06] And then of course, we got extreme ownership of the Nicodemy leadership.
[03:46:08] These are the foundational books about leadership that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.
[03:46:13] We got echelon front, which is a leadership consultancy.
[03:46:16] Look, if you have a business, if you have a team, if you have a company and you have
[03:46:20] problems, every single problem that you have is a leadership problem.
[03:46:24] I guarantee that every single problem that you have is a leadership problem.
[03:46:29] And what we do at echelon front is we solve problems through leadership.
[03:46:34] So go to echelonfront.com for details.
[03:46:37] We got EF online, which is leadership, interactive leadership training online, it's EF online.com.
[03:46:44] You can get the information.
[03:46:46] You can get the repetitions.
[03:46:48] You can get put in scenarios that will help you think through problems at EF online.
[03:46:54] We also do little live webinars where we answer questions.
[03:47:00] EF online.com.
[03:47:01] We got the mustard coming up in Dallas, Texas, Orlando, Florida and Phoenix, Arizona.
[03:47:12] Every event that we've done has sold out.
[03:47:15] If you want to come, go to extremownership.com right now and register leadership 7R.
[03:47:21] That's what we do there.
[03:47:22] And of course, we've got EF Overwatch and EF Legion placement for military people that
[03:47:29] understand extremownership.
[03:47:32] Then understand the dichotomy of leadership.
[03:47:34] EF Overwatch is for executive leadership inside companies.
[03:47:36] EF Legion front line troops and front line leaders.
[03:47:40] Go to EF Overwatch.com or EF Legion to get involved in that from either side, whether
[03:47:46] you're a vet.
[03:47:47] That wants to get into a civilian job or either civilian company that needs veterans to help
[03:47:52] you lead and win.
[03:47:53] Go to those websites and get that figured out.
[03:47:56] EF, if you have not heard enough of my overly dramatic speech patterns and excessively long
[03:48:03] pauses.
[03:48:06] And you haven't heard enough of ECHOS ridiculous commentary about the heroic life of being
[03:48:13] a balancer.
[03:48:15] Then we are available on the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram, and on the old Fission
[03:48:22] Blah, echo is that.
[03:48:29] ECHOS and I am at Jock on the link in.
[03:48:31] Thank you all for listening to the podcast and for giving this podcast to your support.
[03:48:36] Thanks for spreading the word.
[03:48:38] Thanks for telling your friends.
[03:48:39] Thanks for getting some deaf core gear or some origin gear, all of which allows us to
[03:48:44] do this podcast.
[03:48:46] And of course, thanks to Reg Curtis for your service and sacrifice to keep us free.
[03:48:58] And all the military members out there in uniform right now doing the same thing, keeping
[03:49:02] the enemy at bay, and also to our police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics
[03:49:07] and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers in Board of Patrol and Secret Service.
[03:49:11] And all first responders.
[03:49:15] Thank you for keeping us safe.
[03:49:17] Every single day here at home and everyone else out there, remember what Reg Curtis taught
[03:49:27] us to never give up even against overwhelming odds to never accept the feet to persevere
[03:49:37] and endure until the end.
[03:49:42] And then when you get tripped up or you get knocked down even then what you do is you do
[03:49:49] the best you can.
[03:49:55] Lesson learned.
[03:49:58] Thank you.
[03:49:59] Reg Curtis and we will be out there in your honor, getting after it.
[03:50:08] And until next time, the ZECO.
[03:50:12] And Jocco.
[03:50:14] Ouch.
