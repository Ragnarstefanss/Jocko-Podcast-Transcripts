yes like you don't really have that like you don't have the you don't have the opposite you like you don't have that thing that tells you hey like don't do it like if you don't feel like doing it don't do it if you think it needs to be done so having that quality helps that kind of situation Like you're behavior changing because you don't feel like doing something got it like so be like I don't feel like it you're just going to the sucking part is just going to be part of the workout kind of thing and it's going to sort of get done so if you start thinking like that in the beginning like start asking yourself well. The only way they're ever going to know that is if their leadership makes that a priority, though, or else they're going to get stuck down there and their perspective of the world's going to get smaller and smaller, they're going to feel more and more disconnected and they're not going to understand it. Okay, so like consider like this is a close to like, and get it get to it is like a cinnamon added to the pumpkin pie kind of flavor. I'm going to start chipping and I can I can be persistent and I'm going to make progress you know what I don't know if this is like to the same thing And you put some task on me that it's like, well, that's just your idea like let's think so instead instead of like okay let's think through the whole thing really to understand what it takes to do it. but at the end of the day it's kind of like that's how we all are naturally right where if you see a big task or let's say you see like a goal right or something like this You know, that's what, and even if we're not going drinking, you know what, we're not going to we're not going to we're not going to war. At the time, I wasn't like, do you know I'm going to add this to like your bio when I talk about you? If I don't have if I only got one hour sleep like that's just not doable for me you know the fact that the fact is it is doable it's going to suck but if that's not a factering you're thinking then you're just going to do it And they like anchored the ship and they dove down and like cut the thing off and they kind of like helped. I'll do stuff all like organize little thing like oh man that's kind of messy right there. You still think I still kind of do you think that man, whatever I talked to till those guys, I remember asking till like, was it hard to, no, maybe it was it was Dick Thompson, I was like, was it hard because he volunteered for this volunteer for that The only thing I wrote down I wrote down before he said this is the good news and all this when he's talking about the challenge of making real difficult and realistic training people like hard training. If you want to see what echo Charles looks like, if you want to see what I look like, or you want to see some enhanced videos that echo puts his effort into allegedly. It's the similar thing of people that think, well, you know if I get into a fight, well, you know if I, well, you know if I, bro, I'll go full rage. They like hard training, they respond hard training and for whatever pushes you away from not wanting to make things difficult, that's actually what your people want. You know how I'm always like, you know, I mean, I literally have written books about putting your people out of you and take care of the people and all that. There's nothing that I'm going to find on earth to to attack that's infinite right there's no infinite thing that I can think of that I would look at is with a view of like okay here's something I want to do And so we got to brief, you know, that we did this thing, which was kind of, you know, at the time was pretty cool. So if we don't have even a goal of what good looks like, if we haven't written down what good looks like, how are we possibly going to get there. Like, and I've certain altitude or you got come on, did you kind of like, hey bro, I would love to tell you the coolest story in the world. Yeah, that that is really what it is it's like it's it's too big of a problem then I'm in the mood for it's like that kind of situation because you do this all the time even on a small level. Oh yeah big time even that an out of your right there the iceberg like I see it you're like So you've got to just train individuals basic unit training to improve the proficiency of crews teams and squads advanced unit training to integrate teams cruise and squads into small units combined arms training to integrate infantry armor artillery engineer and other supporting units into company and battalion. so like if you're about to work out and you're like man I got this hard workout There was also guys that were, you know, we ain't going or we ain't going or you were going drinking. You know, like the last seal puttune in early 70s, one of the 72 73 something like the last seal puttune, there's a couple more stragglers over there.
