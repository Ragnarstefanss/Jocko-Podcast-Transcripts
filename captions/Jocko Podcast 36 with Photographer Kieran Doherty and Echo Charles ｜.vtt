00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is Jocco podcast number 36 with echoed Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Behold.

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The world is a sight to behold.

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm just back from a trip to the wilderness. In the Sierra Mountains of California, and every time you open your eyes, there's a sight to behold.

5
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
An image of beauty.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000
From a distance, a mountain of solid granite almost 100 million years old, Juts up from the valley floor.

7
00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Up close the roots of a newborn tree trying to find purchase, maneuvering around and over and through rock until it finds soil.

8
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And in doing so, draws an infinitely complex picture of life.

9
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Yes, the world is a beautiful place.

10
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But we also know that the world can be a horrible place, a wretched place.

11
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And in the military, I was usually sent to the bad places.

12
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And in a way, I was sent to those bad places to deal with them, to keep them away from us.

13
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Those of us lucky enough to be born in the right country with the right form of government and the right supply of water and food and energy.

14
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And it was our job as the lucky ones to keep the horror away, to shield the eyes of the blessed.

15
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But there are other people whose job it is to open eyes, to show the world not just the light, but also the darkness.

16
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And that's the life of a photographer. And like the soldier, he must travel.

17
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And like the soldier, he must take risk.

18
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And like the soldier, he must face the darkness and live with it.

19
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And like the soldier, to an even greater degree, he must detach from what is happening.

20
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000
He must observe from the outside, be a part of what is happening in front of him without being a part of what is happening in front of him.

21
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And we have a guest on the podcast tonight.

22
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And a friend of mine who spent his life with a camera in his hand capturing light and capturing darkness.

23
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So the podcast, Mr. Kieran, Doctor D, who in addition to being a friend, an outstanding drummer, a husband, a dad and last but not least, an award winning photographer.

24
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Welcome to the podcast, Karen.

25
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Thank you for having me. Good to have you on detected a little accent there, you're from a sending the shine sent you to take. Just a little in that.

26
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So you're from England. And how did this whole business start, how did you end up start taking pictures?

27
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
How did I start taking pictures?

28
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:30.000
My dad was a good photographer, always at a camera. And I think I got to my 17th birthday and he gave his cameras to my sister.

29
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Now I had no interest in the cameras at the time, but I suddenly had an interest when I found he gave him to my sister.

30
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So I demanded that I have them, I had to do some sort of swap, but I got the cameras.

31
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But I didn't really use them. I really wanted to be an artist, I wanted to paint, but I wasn't good enough in my own eyes. I was okay, but not good enough.

32
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So the camera became a tool for me to create and express myself. And I ended up, I did a degree course after school in sports science. And then I went on to do oops, yeah.

33
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I was like, hey, listen, it was a great course. I had three years playing tennis and football. I mean, come on, it was a great course.

34
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So I wasn't really good enough to get onto an outfound. They should course, I did the sports course and then I wanted to concentrate on doing course in photography.

35
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So my mum found a course for me and there's only one course in the country and they only took 12 people. And normally had to apply five or six times to get on.

36
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And so I applied for the course I went for an interview and I showed a portfolio of appalling black and white pictures that I had shot.

37
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I mean, really appalling I'd gone to a couple of music festivals and I had pictures of dribbling babies and primes. I mean, this is what I took to my interview. But they put me on the reserve list. So I was number 13.

38
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And it meant that I wasn't going to get on the course because they weren't only taking to our own. So my mum, every day, for about six months rang the head tutor and said, come on, put him on the course.

39
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And come on, put him on the course and I'll have to six months. He just stopped this woman calling me every day. Okay, okay. And he put me on his number 13.

40
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And I did the course and I ended up spending most of my weekends traveling at home down to an agency at home where I, you were really working. So the course was teaching you how to do stuff.

41
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And the job that I wanted to do, you can't learn it in a classroom really. It's a bit of common sense and just reacting to the environment around you. So I used to spend my weekends traveling home and working for a real agency and they would just send me out on stuff and I would be shooting pictures, developing transparencies black and white printing, putting it on wire drums sending it into the papers. You know, in the real one, that's what do my weekends and then I go back to the course.

42
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I just felt the course was really dragging for me. But I finished it and the route is you join a regional newspaper and then you sort of cut your teeth in the industry then you go to maybe a big provincial paper and then you head down to maybe London for a work on a national.

43
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And then maybe after the national you might consider working on an agency. Well, I didn't have time for any of that. So I just went straight to London at a college.

44
00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And try to try to get a job. But I ended up what you end up doing is you go around and you just spec pictures into newspapers. So you find a job you shoot it.

45
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:13.000
You ring them up and you say I have this great picture and you need to you really should have it and they would say okay, bring it in and you would take it in and they go thanks.

46
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000
But we had our own photographer there and blah blah blah. So I did this for two or three years not really getting anywhere and I ended up.

47
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I learned a few tricks to the trade, which is you turn up to a news event that's happening and you shoot the pictures and then you ring the desk, the wire desk wherever it is you want to sell the picture to and you say listen.

48
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Very few people were here and this is a big story and really you can't afford not to take this from me because your opposition was here.

49
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And I think you really should see this picture. So they'd say come in and I went in one so I'd shot this picture of this tank that appeared outside the high court in London.

50
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And coming out of this tank was a 20 foot Marlin.

51
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
It was just the most ridiculous thing. And it was some guy protesting about a divorce he was going through.

52
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Sorry just loaded up the tank. I just headed out the court. And I drove I was driving past with a friend and I thought I better shoot that picture and I shot that picture and I rang up and I said listen associated press were here.

53
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Reuters you really should take this picture of me and I went in and it was such a ridiculous looking image that they said great we'll take it. And so they just snip the negatives because it was filming those days they take three negatives the one in the middle they want to piss the one they scan.

54
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And I just thought right I need to keep doing this. So if I come in here with a picture, do you give me 75 pounds every time I come in they said well every picture we take will pay you 75 pounds.

55
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:14.000
So of course I just kept ringing them and kept ringing them and eventually they caught them on to the amount of 75 pounds they were giving me in a day and they said okay listen we'll put you on shift. So we will pay you 100 pounds and you will work five shifts we will stop paying you five times 75 every time you get in.

56
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And that's how it started and so it's a bit of luck and a bit of determination and yeah that's how that's how I got into it and if I'm totally honest I really didn't know that that sort of job existed.

57
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I'd seen magazines by photographers like Don McCullen who used to shoot the troubles in Northern Ireland in the early days and I used to see his spread on the Sunday times but it never dawned on I used to look at the images was mesmerized by these black and white images.

58
00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:02.000
But never put them together and work so this is obviously a job and somebody does this and he's paid to do this. And so yeah it sort of don't do me this this this is an existence that I really quite like because I don't have to wear a suit.

59
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I can wear jeans in a t-shirt and I can just shoot and create and I can un-erliving and that's really how it started. And then you ended up staying at Reuters for what 10 years.

60
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:34.000
No from 1993 to 2008. So I was freelance until 2000 and then in 2000 when which was really for tutors because my first doors was born they made me staff so there was this security of the job there.

61
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And then I resigned in 2008 so I sort of done my stintestuff and I decided that I wanted to move on to other things. But yeah it was a bumpy road but it was and I couldn't have asked for a better grounding into further journalism than working for a while.

62
00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:08.000
But I was just going to cover everything from spot news from something that was happening in Downing Street to covering Wimbledon to covering World Cups Olympic Games, all zones.

63
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:21.000
You name it there was nothing a wire in Cifatore ever didn't cover and so you know literally you could you could come off from shooting a Champions League football match and the next day you could be in Afghanistan.

64
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Shooting a shooting a new story that's how it worked and that's incredibly intoxicating especially when you're a young guy you know I mean I didn't get to travel immediately obviously I had to cut my teeth and they had to trust that they could send me away and I must admit it took a couple of years.

65
00:12:40.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And in fact my first assignment by my line manager he just said to me one Friday night I need to go to Belfast there for July the 12th for the troubles and I said I can't and he said what do you mean I said well I've got a gig tonight I'm playing in London and there are 13 other people in the band and if I get on a plane they're not going to have a drama.

66
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So you went to Belfast? No you didn't be held the gig.

67
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Bro, I didn't realize I was too naive to realize the implications of why why you know I sorry this guy wants to work for artists and I'm going to send them to Belfast to cover the troubles and he wants to play drums in a club.

68
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Yeah, so I learnt that lesson pretty quick. How long did it take to get another offer to travel like that? I think the Belfast offer was 95 and then I ended up traveling literally 98.

69
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:54.000
So to put you on the bench for three years. I mean yeah totally but when I did get to go he waited to lie bit married a month and then said to me I need you to go away for four months.

70
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And I just married you know I've been married for a month and you want me to go any and it was the Caribbean believe it or not to photograph cricket England against the West Indies. So it wasn't that tough.

71
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Yeah and I ended up being able to take my life with me as well. So yeah you can't complain about that at all not at all at all. We had a great time. So tell me about like a little bit about the times where you went to Belfast and what that was like for the first time where you're going okay.

72
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Do you feel that tension for the first time you feel kind of the presence of violence around you? I was in over-surek and bearing in mind that I had lived in Belfast. So I lived in there during the sort of the troubles and for me five or six years in my life I was there.

73
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Although I never experienced any of the troubles it was very protected from it but yeah I mean you know I went back and I was petrified I thought where do I go where can I not go and I was very conscious of my name.

74
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Very Catholic name and there are certain there's a bit of privacy don't know Karen's name is is the same name as one of the the heroes of the IRA.

75
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And who actually died in prison from a from a hunger strike so then that's your name. So there's no that's my name.

76
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Absolutely and you know of course just a clarifier was not named after him but just coincident but the remurals all over Belfast with Karen Doctor.

77
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So there are certain areas of Belfast I could walk into very easily and there are certain areas of Belfast that I didn't really want to be caught with my press card in my pocket.

78
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So yeah it was yeah I was I was petrified you know there's no it's no author of a scribe it.

79
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And did you start thanking yourself well maybe this isn't a job for me or did you or you thinking yourself I'm scared but this is awesome.

80
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Yeah absolutely yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's sort of the typical you know when I talk to obviously all on my friend the military that's everyone's feeling you know hey I was scared but that was awesome yeah that's when everybody wants to do it I mean as a photographer when you're in there and there's.

81
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:26.000
The potential to have those shots those moments of of human existence that only happened at that place at that time and you've got that opportunity that yeah I mean you're waiting.

82
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
The worst thing is you get over there and there's nothing happening because that's what happens that you know.

83
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Leading up to July the 12th and there may be the pockets of violence and that happened usually in the evenings after the pubs closed.

84
00:16:43.000 --> 00:17:04.000
It and the one thing it did it made the flames really stand out when they did throw those petro bombs you know but what you were doing was.

85
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:15.000
It's just to sort of justify the air flight out here and whatnot so and it would be really tough and so those were the toughest moments because you were having to find images that sort of.

86
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:38.000
It's a total of story but they weren't really the reason why you were there you were sent there because they were expecting trouble and then.

87
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I mean physical happening in front of you it's almost as if you needed to get one under your belt to calm down because then you're able to set a care produced something from here that's not worthy and newsworthy.

88
00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And sometimes you go on this trip and there'd be nothing for a week and you'd be sitting in your own and you're out there and there'd be nothing for a week and that that was the worst but as soon as something did happen it was then a catalyst.

89
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Something happening that night there was always the clear up the next morning so that was then the catalyst for actually what would maybe happen during the week and one thing would lead to another.

90
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:33.000
And you'd end up beginning to feel a little bit more confident and you know I was just watching the guys that were a lot older than me and far more experienced and I just sort of hung around with those guys sort of you just trying to work out what do you do.

91
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And that's how you learn you just watch how these other photographers are doing it and you just think okay long remember that next time and because these guys came in and they just looked immensely cool and.

92
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:58.000
You know they sort of knew what they were doing and also just did you ever have a time period where you thought you were more badass than you were or you always pretty humble about hey you know what these guys they they know more than me I'm just going to watch them and learn.

93
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:10.000
I mean you obviously thought you're pretty badass when you're like you know what I'm not going for the regional paper I'm going straight to London yeah yeah you're right but I don't know where that came from I just thought I'd lost enough time.

94
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:21.000
I think I can't hang around doing you know I mean no discussion and there were no jobs going anyway the end of the course so I just thought well you know so yeah badass me probably not.

95
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:37.000
I mean I'm still if I'm I'm not really want to work with other photographers now but when you're working in Fleet Street and you're working for a news agency you can't help but be in the pack and you're always working with other photographers and there are.

96
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:49.000
It's time goes by the there are sort of few of photographers that you begin to sort of look to you can sort of work out which are the ones that are doing something similar to the way you want to be doing it.

97
00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And there are others that do their own thing because it all photographers are completely different you can have ten photographers standing next to each other and they can all shoot the same picture but every single image will be completely different because each photographer has decided.

98
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:15.000
There's a different part of what's happening in front of him that he wants to concentrate on. So and that's what I found you know was happening a lot which especially with you sent down to down extreme to do the prime minister the prime minister just walked the door open the prime minister walk out of the door and get into the car and drive off.

99
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:32.000
And that was seven pictures yeah and the guy next to you could be a could be a a trainee and he will stand in he'll shoot the same. imagery with the same cameras and same lens and that you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a guy who's been doing it 20 years and a trainee because.

100
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And that's a very sort of orchestrated theatrical moment you know and that's I didn't I wasn't really interested in that sort of stuff. I was interested in stuff that was really spontaneous sporadic and.

101
00:20:44.000 --> 00:21:03.000
And you had to be ready for it and you had to react to it and that's what I like to do react to what was happening did did you feel like going to Ireland. In the in the late 90s and in early 2000 did you feel that that prepared you at all for for going to Iraq for going to the other places that you went to.

102
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Good. Prepared preparatory step yeah absolutely and you know what to be totally honest. I've never even thought about that that thought has never crossed my mind until you just said it.

103
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Did you think that prepared me and I thought actually you're not you have courses did but.

104
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:32.000
It's funny when you're working you don't you don't think about things like that you don't I mean if I'd kept a diary which I've never done. In fact I did when I was in Sri Lanka but if I was if I'd kept a diary.

105
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I maybe would have had a little bit more self awareness of my progression through my career. But when you're you know your priorities are on earning money. You know and and being able to pay the rent and am I going to get work next week or is that other guy who's coming.

106
00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:13.000
You know you look quite good is he going to start getting my shifts you know and so you're constantly on your toes and you're not thinking and you think if I get the art the normal island gig. I got that and he didn't that's enough you know and that's how you were thinking you weren't really that I had no structure to my career whatsoever.

107
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I think maybe because the whole thing was so new to me and I just couldn't get my head around the fact that I was actually making a living as a photographer.

108
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And that's really actually pretty similar to what I experienced on my first appointment to Iraq where never mind.

109
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Never mind anything. We were happy to be out doing operations. Like we were going to go do real operations man we were what the strategy the the danger the whatever it was like.

110
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Hey we are here we are doing operations to catch bad guys awesome.

111
00:22:47.000 --> 00:23:08.000
That was our focus. So it sounds like you in the mindset that similar mindset and it took me a couple months of being in Iraq and getting that out of my system before I was like okay so let's take a look at what we're actually doing here and how we're trying to affect the battle space because I was just too young and and

112
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:21.000
I didn't experience and I just need to get some experience under my belt. So sounds like it and really sounds like Ireland kind of prepares you for that but I also look at.

113
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Okay so let's just go straight then to you get the call how did you know you got we're going to get the call to go to Iraq was that.

114
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Was it a lottery how do they do they just say hey we want to get you down there how did that work the way it works it was they.

115
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:46.000
No photographer was ever forced to go to a hostile environment so it wasn't part of your remit that if you work for a lawyer you must go to a hostile environment they would never like that.

116
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
They you know and you can see why what they.

117
00:23:49.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Is it wrong for me to picture every for because I have I put my I put my personality over a guy with a camera and so I think like every guy with a camera is going I want to go to the war zone tomorrow is that not true.

118
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Yeah, that's not true. There are a lot of guys that don't want to go anywhere near a hostile environment. Okay. Yeah, see that's that's important for me to know these things because I would.

119
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:21.000
In my mind everyone's just thinking I'm going to go get after them. Oh, I got a camera there's a war going on. Let's go make it happen. Yeah, I mean that was then that was yeah, 2003.

120
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:35.000
I would say maybe it's slightly changed now there are a lot more photographers young photographers going to war zones, but then no it was I think if I remember rightly they.

121
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:45.000
They because the build up to the war was so you know prolonged yeah I mean we knew it was going to happen and a read and immediately though those guys that wanted to.

122
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I was one that embedded with the artillery in QA so we had a month waiting QA and then just went with the artillery there were the.

123
00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Reuters had very seasoned photographers very experienced in those sort of environments that would then embed with Americans or Brits and those were the guys that were being shot at on a daily basis.

124
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
But extremely hard to produce imagery from those situations.

125
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
And I remember I had a very good friend of mine said to me who did a lot of that stuff he said,

126
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Kieran thing about going and embedding with the soldier is that.

127
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:40.000
You can get in the way and the last thing you want is to compromise a unit but they set these units up and they said yep the media has to come in and you know show us what's happening but most of the time he said you have your head down and your hand in the air and you're just blindly shooting and hoping.

128
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:49.000
And he said in very early you get nothing you know I mean that's not always the case but he said majority of the time and you have to do it a lot before you're sort of hit rate.

129
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
You know gets some.

130
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Get some moved up and and.

131
00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
If you're embedded I think you struggle if you go unilaterally which is the really unsafe way to do it so you're on your own.

132
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
You're on your own.

133
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
You're on your own.

134
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Yeah, they're there you've got the chance of getting something and again it's being in the right place at the right time.

135
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:15.000
So they'd said they had certain guys in place that stuck their hands up straight away yep I'm doing that that's me I'll be embedded there.

136
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:28.000
And I'll do this and I'll do that and we spent a month looking at the stuff that was coming out and it was invariably pictures of soldiers within sandstorms and stuff like that you know there was no action you know it was.

137
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
I wouldn't say that was true from all of them but the majority of the case was very difficult to produce imagery when you're embedded.

138
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:43.000
I certainly wasn't interested in being a unilateral that time at all but I was really interested in.

139
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Going and doing what happens after the war so what interests me is the people afterwards I was 10 to think that people going and shoot what's happening and that moves on and then the photographer was moving on with them and I wanted to just.

140
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Going in that backdrop and photograph what was happening. Life wise after you know soldiers have been in there and and that's exactly what I said I said I'd be happy.

141
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
To go to bad dad you know pretty much almost once it's secure.

142
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
It didn't quite work out that way I think we went a little bit earlier.

143
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Yeah and it never is a security think and I remember I think I got the the day after the the statue of Saddam was pulled down and it was.

144
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.000
It was a moment if you for a bagad and I just thought hey you know what this isn't.

145
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.000
I mean my first trip to Belfast was worse than this this is okay but we'd had but we turned up and had the.

146
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Face with the problem of one of our camera men had just been killed it under friendly fire.

147
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:06.000
And that had taken a huge hit on the roators and that really hit home that actually this is really not safe place.

148
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And it's a really good place because it's still an awful lot going on and there's still an awful lot of misunderstanding and.

149
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
And so that was a real level or me go out there and.

150
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:30.000
And staying in the Palestine hotel was incredibly exciting because it was just there were just photographers and journalists and just buzzing around everywhere and.

151
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:44.000
There are care I'm here now so what am I going to do and it's almost as if I had to get out there and start shooting and I didn't care what it was that I started shooting I just I'm here now I need to start shooting something as well as the feeling that I had.

152
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
I'm going to let's go.

153
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Yeah yeah so and and I said to them I said to my the chief photographer there said Jack what what do you want me to do he said I don't know what kind of the square and see what's happening.

154
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:12.000
And I walked out into the square and there were kids playing around in the in the main square in the fountain because and you kind of go out we were talking about this earlier today but you and you just said the work you for it right and a lot of people because the the the war and Iraq actually still going on right now.

155
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
But it's really easy to forget the initial.

156
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:25.000
I don't know four or five weeks after it started when we had crushed. You know, Saddam's regime and now the people were.

157
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Wave in American flags they're acupy were wave in American flags they were hugging they were happy and it's really easy to forget that because things turned.

158
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.000
So bad really you know with them within a couple months they turned bad and then they went down from there.

159
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Yeah, but you were just like, oh, you know what I'm going to go out in the outside the palace on hotel which is which is by the way across the river from the green zone but still was a very well protected.

160
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Yeah, fairly well protected hotel that a lot of Westerners stayed in and.

161
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:14.000
You just said, oh, I'm going to walk outside and check it out no security no security. Just get nothing. Yeah, just what can I shoot and yeah and I and I found this picture of this kid and I I still have that picture on my website.

162
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:27.000
But it's a little kid and he just pulls his head out of the water and he's swimming in this fountain that and you wouldn't believe what was in the fountain. I couldn't believe these kids are swimming in it, but he just sort of popped his head out and stood there and flexed his muscles.

163
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:48.000
And it was just a young nine ten year old guy just flexing his muscles and the light was fantastic and it just made such a beautiful image. I mean, it really did and I thought, okay. I just got here and I've shot a really nice picture. I felt really proud of myself and I thought, okay, and I just walked that back in and of course it was mayhem happening.

164
00:30:48.000 --> 00:31:02.000
And all the more people were actually doing was in there and the press is moving out of the Palestine hotel to a house that they'd rented because we were then becoming quite a big outfit and the Palestine hotel was never going to house it.

165
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:17.000
But staff that we had so we were moving out to a big house just a couple of blocks away but again it was like bell fast. I had got something under my belt and I felt pretty good about it and I thought, okay, right, let's bring it on.

166
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Let's see how many places I can get to, how many stories I can shoot every day and I didn't want to stop shooting. I just, I wanted to get up at seven in the morning and go and work with the light and then.

167
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:51.000
So the day was never really a good time to shoot because the light was dreadful and then I'd wait for the sort of late afternoon and the gold now, which became tricky because we were never really allowed to be out at dark. So I just wanted to shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot and of course it doesn't.

168
00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Quite a workout that way because there are certain responsibilities on a photographer whose first language is English when you go into a place like Baghdad where the captioning on images is extremely important and it's extremely important that the captioning is correct.

169
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:21.000
It's valid verified and it has no spelling mistakes and of course being the only photographer in there that first language is English I ended up.

170
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Where are most of the photographers from? Well we had, I mean all over Europe, we had different you know and there was maybe only four, four was in there at a time three or four was in there at a time.

171
00:32:32.000 --> 00:33:01.000
And I've got a friend, your guy, German, Croatian, yeah absolutely and we were all looking for you know we're all we're all looking for those great pictures so you know you began to wonder okay how's this going to be divided up every day who's going to get what you know I'm like are you looking for pictures at this point that are good pictures that you want to see or you looking for pictures that are going to be news are going to be front page newspaper which one of those two or is it both.

172
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Primarily if I'm completely honest because because a picture of like when you describe that picture of a kid.

173
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Poena's had out of this dirty water he's ten years old and he's flexing that's just an awesome image right and I'm sure that's a great picture.

174
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:27.000
That picture is not going on the front page of newspapers though is it absolutely no but you don't but that's your focus is I want to get good pictures that are capturing the images of what you're seeing around you as opposed to.

175
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Hey I just want this front page picture yeah I mean I was never really one for looking for publications I was always shooting for me.

176
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:43.000
I mean somebody wants to ask me to interview who's your biggest audience I'm not looking to please.

177
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Editors or whatever obviously it helps if they're with what you have done yeah but I was primarily looking to satisfy myself and I've never.

178
00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:08.000
I never that's never changed with me and so yeah I totally understand that you know when you're in a situation I say that but obviously we'll get on to something later that showed I completely didn't understand but.

179
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I understand when there's the front page I understand the impacts and I understand what they mean to the company totally and don't get me wrong when I was getting front pages it was a great feeling you know it's sort of verified you're.

180
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
I just defined the fact that you were out there and you were doing it.

181
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:36.000
But you know there are so many other agencies out there and so many other photographers out there you have to get really lucky you just have to get that one image that separates it from everyone else and I knew how you know how difficult that is.

182
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
So I never concerned myself with looking for that image.

183
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:55.000
So to begin to think listen if I think the image is strong. You have a bit of confidence in your own ability to judge whether or not an image is strong or not and whether or not it has a good chance of making.

184
00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:04.000
So if you're not if you know if if it's a listen it's features today just go out and find something that you know every picture you choose not going to tell the story.

185
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Of what's happening in Iraq but for me that picture of that boy that day three days after whatever bagad had been liberated.

186
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:22.000
I should have kept playing in the water and looking feeling happy and I thought yeah do you know what that's what's happening that whatever's happening in bagad now is being.

187
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
That child is a conduit for a capsule.

188
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Yeah captures the emotion and the spirit of what's going on around you. Yeah and that's it's a good overall I think.

189
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Add it to have with everyone any of you hear this all the time right. You say you know do what you're going with your heart is basically what you're saying absolutely and I'm going to agree with you.

190
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
I mean and again we've talked about this before even just with what we're doing here.

191
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:57.000
This is based on what we want to do in our toughest audience or our most important on interest like us you know what do we want to do what can we.

192
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000
How do we feel about making this and how does it feel to record it and how does it feel when I put the headphones on and listen to it is it what I want to hear.

193
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Because that's you know that's so I'm doing it and we're doing it more for the value of itself rather than I mean there's no doubt that we're not saying hey.

194
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Everybody listen to this you know because we know that this isn't everybody and we're okay with that and I think that's a good attitude to have.

195
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Yeah that's usually how it turns out the best anyway because you know what you like and you know what's going to make what you like good or look good in case.

196
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
If you try to estimate what everyone else likes all you have is this like.

197
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.000
You know, you know, you're not talking about just one other individual that you know really good you talk about a bunch of people so.

198
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:57.000
A lot of times people and it turns out real obvious when they're trying to please other people with what they're doing and she goes for so many things just like how you're saying.

199
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
So you know they're trying to basically play for the cheap seats they're trying you know they're trying to.

200
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:12.000
This where the goal should be doing a good job doing the best that you can do and we talk about it with jitter with everything that the belt isn't the goal the front page.

201
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
That's not the goal the goal is to do the best that you can do for your work you know.

202
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Yeah and like I said if you if you if you don't do it that way man it just you can smell it from one from my little way man.

203
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:33.000
I don't know that there are any apart from even even the image that did make all the front swars in Iraq.

204
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:40.000
I don't think in my career there's one image that's made a front page that I would keep and put in a portfolio of images.

205
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:49.000
So that just shows you that the stuff that I really like is really the stuff that most people don't see and it's you know people will say.

206
00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:01.000
You shot that picture yeah and I really like that picture and I have really weird reasons for really liking that picture but and that's the stuff that I really enjoy doing is most people never see that stuff.

207
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
You know and they're surprised when they do see it.

208
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:12.000
But I this I don't think there is a picture that I would take from front page that I've had that I would want to keep and show.

209
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And and that's one thing I know from knowing you and things you told me there's times where you're looking at a picture and you're saying.

210
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
There's a tragedy here.

211
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
This is a person's life being destroyed.

212
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
I'm not going to sell this picture I'm not going to publish this picture I'm going to delete this picture.

213
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:39.000
You know you you have your own personal standard to which I have the utmost respect for that you're not going to I mean there's so many people in me especially now with.

214
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Social media and everyone's everyone's photographer now because that has an iPhone and people just shoot I mean there's whole websites that are dedicated to.

215
00:38:48.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Debasing people right you know and and the fact that you're a professional you you draw you do that line a long time ago is very respectable.

216
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:11.000
So you got some kids and you got some nice things about the euphoria of Iraq as it kicks off and they're liberated in.

217
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
There's also some some horror mixed in there as well.

218
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Yeah absolutely just and it always comes when you least expect it.

219
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:44.000
And we we just moved into this new house in Baghdad and everything was set up on all the comms are set up and I know it's about five o'clock in the afternoon and a call came in and the call just said a photographer and a.

220
00:39:44.000 --> 00:40:02.000
TV guy need to get to this address in Baghdad and I was sitting there in jacks head here and you know off you go and take take it obviously take a vest and a hat we always have to travel those and we travel the down with vehicles everywhere.

221
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:16.000
So we we went to the address and I sort of I got out onto the pavement and I was looking around and I we had no idea we'd know I do why we've been called.

222
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:29.000
And somebody came running up to me since this is all the cameras and they said a euphoria from noises and I said yeah and they said okay.

223
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I a gentleman he came out and he was. I could not stand where he was saying and there was somebody there sort of translating and it soon came to pass that his son had just been killed from.

224
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:59.000
I was blown up while he was in his friends were playing with it and it was the young it was a kid that was killed his son and the father just.

225
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:15.000
I was in the same bag with a plastic bag and I wasn't even up until that moment I just wasn't aware of what was what was going on.

226
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I was a little bit more surprised that he was a little bit more surprised that he was a little bit quicker than me and he started to produce body parts from the bag that was you know.

227
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:45.000
I was a little bit more surprised that he was a little bit more comfortable as body parts but they were coming out of this bag and and interpret as saying he needs you to photograph this because he wants you to show.

228
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:57.000
He doesn't want his son's death to be in vain and he can't start grieving until you take these pictures.

229
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:17.000
I think I took six or seven pictures and he ended up putting the plastic bag back down on the floor and he just said thank you and it was just Chokran and he just then he walked in and interpreted now he can start to grieve.

230
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:29.000
I noticed that the TV journalist Cameron was he was Iraqi and he just completely collapsed.

231
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:46.000
I remember having to get in back into the car because what had the he just witnessed was just so shocking and I was just numb going all the way back to the the office because you know I.

232
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:59.000
I just hadn't anticipated anything like that happening and it just came out of the blue and I understood why I could understand the father's sentiments.

233
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:15.000
I totally got what he was trying to do but at the same time I totally understood that this you know those images weren't couldn't go on the wire they were just so utterly horrific and graphic and I remember.

234
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:34.000
I was shooting it I just I wasn't even looking so I had my I remember my I was the camera but I wasn't even looking at what was you know so if you were to apart from the first moment if you were to say to me you know what I couldn't tell you I just knew that it was just coming out and being held up and being put back.

235
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:46.000
I couldn't bring myself to look and then I sort of got back and I the first thing I did was just delete.

236
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:56.000
And I never actually said to my bosses there that I deleted those images I just thought I am not putting those images on the wire I sort of took an executive decision.

237
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:09.000
I know that time I didn't mention anything to anyone else there and the only thing I had was that I kept was just a portrait of the father so we could move the portrait of the father and talk about the story.

238
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:29.000
And I think I then spoke to my dad that night and I sort of you know took the vegan saffron and just rang him and I just told him what had just happened and we were sitting in the garden and then that night.

239
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:41.000
And I wanted to give the staff a break and so they'd organised the barbecue and there was you know there was going to be some there was a belly down certain up.

240
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:55.000
And it was an amazing night because all the Iraqis that had not been able to party in 40 years were all sitting on the roofs of their houses surrounding the house that we were on and they were just listening to the music and it was an incredible thing to see.

241
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:03.000
And from something that happened like that at five o'clock to something barbecue that was happening at seven p.m.

242
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:20.000
And those moments were incredibly difficult to sort of disseminate and work out what was going on because and of course it was something I kept myself apart from that I think maybe they found out maybe the TV journalists had said something but I just didn't want to speak to anyone.

243
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000
And I think that the actors to the office about what had just happened you know.

244
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And I don't and I think to be honest they would have completely agreed that this is not imagery that we can put out you know so there's no purpose and it's just you know just not injured that they would move.

245
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:49.000
So yeah there was there was plenty of that in Iraq and you sort of had to just take it in your stride because the next day.

246
00:45:49.000 --> 00:46:05.000
You'd be up and there'd be the next story and you'd sort of move on to that but that would still be in the back of your mind you know and then you know quite honestly soon enough you know if you're busy and you're doing a lot of stuff when you're sitting around not doing anything that's when you really begin to think about stuff.

247
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:18.000
But if you're busy and you're out and you're traveling so a week after that I was taking anything and he even if I was being you know sent out and stuff that I thought why am I being sent to do this you know.

248
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:27.000
I didn't mind I just I'll take it better than sitting around and yeah just with your own totally totally yeah absolutely.

249
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:47.000
And and it's also weird and it's hard for people that haven't been in a war zone before to understand how things like what you're talking about this obviously everyone anticipates or expects that there's the horror of war but then understand the barbecue part like that that's a hard thing for people understand that you can be what just three months.

250
00:46:47.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Just three months into this war and we've got the Reuters staff having a staff party I mean okay and people in America know what a little staff office party is hey guys we're gonna go and order some pizzas.

251
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:10.000
They do that they do that in these war zones and and the military does it the the I mean I've talked about it about it about you mean these big bases that we had eventually built had.

252
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Subway sandwiches the company subway and the company Burger King and the company Starbucks were on these bases so if you want to have a little subway party for your boys you could do that fire up the grill have you know.

253
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
So it's really a hard dichotomy for people to understand that inside the.

254
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Protected areas we carve out little chunks of America little chunks of freedom did you take any pictures of the Iraqis looking at the party.

255
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Yeah I did that was pretty almost but you know what they weren't great pictures because.

256
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
It was so dark.

257
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:53.000
And it was I took a few and I saw and of course the other photographer was there that was taking stuff as well you know.

258
00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:09.000
So yeah I did and I I've always thought about that I remember those pictures but they didn't we didn't they weren't good enough I just I just didn't shoot it well enough you know I just didn't have the right lens and I just yeah and and I think that was sort of a you know.

259
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
That might have been as a result of what had happened earlier but.

260
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Yeah I now have thought about that I have thought about those and and.

261
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:28.000
And that that remains with me as a memory that I saw because I think it's like any of you concentrate so hard on taking pictures of stuff you never actually take anything in.

262
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
But that was a moment that I really wanted to take in because it was just incredible to see.

263
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:45.000
These people out on their rules just enjoying the music and not being afraid and you know somebody said to me this is not happened in 40 years and I just thought that was just.

264
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Incredible and those are the people that I talk about you know I was I always end up trying to explain to people that there's that the normal citizen I rack is a normal person.

265
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:11.000
That wants to have a job raise their kids have a house and that's what they want to do and it's really hard I mean America does a terrible job of showing that I mean America media does a terrible job of showing what that is.

266
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
You know all you see is the crazy all you see is the extremists.

267
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:23.000
But that's a great example of people going hey know what we've been impressed for 40 years they're listening to music this is awesome let's let's watch them and.

268
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:30.000
And yeah and those are the people that wanted to take Iraq and the right direction.

269
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Yeah you did end up getting some pretty important I mean important well maybe important but you ended up with some some pictures that did end up on the on the front pages of.

270
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Yeah that's right it was some.

271
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Coming off the back of another amazing story where I'd been to Najaf to follow a cleric who was coming back who'd been exiled 40 years before.

272
00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:15.000
By Saddam and he was coming back to Najaf and I'd spent two or three days down there waiting for him and that whole scenario of him turning up with thousands of followers and being pushed into the mosque as I'm trying to photograph him and.

273
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:30.000
You know finding myself in the middle of a mosque as a Westerner just thinking you know how did I get in here it was just you know and and that's what happens when you stand in front of the door and wait for the guy to turn up you're just going to get taken in with him.

274
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:45.000
And I done that and I'd really enjoyed that job and that and the sort of anticipation of waiting for this guy to turn up and it wasn't incredible moment.

275
00:50:45.000 --> 00:51:01.000
And I was just in the Jaff back to the hotel which was probably a mile you know and I know you didn't think twice had all my camera gear around you just didn't think twice about walking down that street.

276
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:28.000
About three quarters away there we got a call and it said you need to turn off to there's a a mask grave has been found at hill and you're on route while you're going to pass it on the way back into Baghdad so can you stop off and have a look and my first reaction was I was so shattered from the four days in the Jaff that I was sort of slightly resigned about having to you know.

277
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Really because we have to be back in Baghdad before it's dark and you know.

278
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:49.000
I just I had a really sort of ambivalent attitude to it so we we found this place and we pulled up and everyone said right hey guys you've got literally 40 minutes because but we got to be out of here before the sun's down.

279
00:51:49.000 --> 00:52:03.000
So we got out and I just sort of walked over this mound and as I walked over the mound that was here there was just hundreds of bodies just laid out in front of me and they'd been there.

280
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:17.000
I think it was probably about four or five days I think it was obvious how long they've been there because you can see how many bodies that they pulled out of the pit that they dug there and it was obviously an execution spot where sedams had taken them.

281
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:33.000
I've been in a how many years before and they'd all been executed just a bullet to the back of the head all men and they were they dug them up and pulled the bodies out and I imagine the relatives had obviously had an idea of where they were but they were never able to do anything until.

282
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:40.000
You know they were in a position Baghdad had been liberated and they felt it was safe enough now to go and try and I think they knew sedams on the run.

283
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:53.000
So they were excavating this area and they'd found all these bodies and they put these bodies into plastic bags and they had a name tag on each body and.

284
00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:05.000
That's when I realized okay that this is this is probably quite well this is bigger than any other mass grave that I'd shot during my time there.

285
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:23.000
So I started shooting and I knew the light was going down and the light was incredible it was just incredible the lights on the sand and everything and I just started shooting and I started shooting the women that were sitting around the edge behind the barbed wire so it obviously made the women sit round and then when they'd finished digging the women were able to walk through the bodies and try and identify.

286
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:36.000
And they were just picking up ID cards and you know trying to sort of figure out who was who and I remember there was one really.

287
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:50.000
The bizarre moment where somebody had taken a body all sorts of means of the skeleton and the corpse and they laid it out in the shape of somebody just lying on the ground it wasn't a case of.

288
00:53:50.000 --> 00:54:04.000
The remains were put into a plastic bag they had actually almost constructed this person as they were and so they were laid out and it looked like a person lying on the ground with their arms out and their legs and the correct position and they head to one side.

289
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:15.000
And I just remember a young kid just walking past holding his dad's hand just staring at this and I thought that must be unbelievable thing for a kid that aged to be staring at.

290
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:32.000
And I remember taking that picture and it's I remember thinking that I've never seen anything like that and I thought somebody has actually gone to the trouble of trying to do this and I couldn't work out why and I thought why have they done this.

291
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:42.000
You know I was pretty sure that it didn't help with the identification of that person but somebody had gone to the trouble of laying this this corpse out so I shot that picture and.

292
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:50.000
And I started moving around and shooting the women and the women were crying and I found I subsequently found out they were only.

293
00:54:50.000 --> 00:55:00.000
And I was crying because I had turned up with a camera so I had altered that situation and when they realized that I was no longer interested in shooting them because they were.

294
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000
They were crying because they thought this is what this photographer needs to see.

295
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:14.000
Yeah, I just I they went back to playing with their dice and so I sort of moved away I thought why won't we be taking any more pictures of that.

296
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:29.000
And so and they had and I know this isn't the right word but remind me, Jocca what's the American version of a JCB or backo a backo so they had a backo in this pit pulling out the bodies and they had a couple of kids underneath collecting.

297
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:44.000
And so the remains and just put into one side and these kids were doing it as if it was just another day you know it was no it was impossible to see.

298
00:55:44.000 --> 00:56:01.000
And I remember seeing a skull roll off the claw of this backo and this kid caught it.

299
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Just called it like a goalkeeper would catch your football and then just put it into a bag.

300
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.52
Yeah, I watched that one, I didn't actually shoot that one.

301
00:56:08.52 --> 00:56:15.000
And so it was a case of getting the job done as quickly as possible,

302
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.12
getting back in the van, and getting back to back there.

303
00:56:18.12 --> 00:56:20.24
And I got back to back there.

304
00:56:20.24 --> 00:56:23.44
And I moved, I think, four or five images,

305
00:56:23.44 --> 00:56:27.12
because I was never really a person to move a lot of imagery.

306
00:56:27.12 --> 00:56:29.52
I thought, if I had some really good stuff,

307
00:56:29.52 --> 00:56:31.80
I didn't want to dilute it with stuff that I thought was inferior.

308
00:56:31.80 --> 00:56:35.60
So I just put the four or five best images out.

309
00:56:35.60 --> 00:56:39.20
And was just hanging around when the chief came in and he said,

310
00:56:39.20 --> 00:56:43.52
listen, how many pictures did you move of that story?

311
00:56:43.52 --> 00:56:44.96
And I said, maybe four or five.

312
00:56:44.96 --> 00:56:47.92
And he said, right, can you better move some more?

313
00:56:47.92 --> 00:56:50.36
Because it's become the number one story in the world.

314
00:56:50.36 --> 00:56:56.36
And I think there was over 2,000 bodies they discovered at this place.

315
00:56:56.36 --> 00:57:00.52
And of course, I then thought, cheese, OK, right.

316
00:57:00.52 --> 00:57:02.52
And then I just sort of slightly panicked,

317
00:57:02.52 --> 00:57:04.40
because I thought, well, I've just edited my stuff.

318
00:57:04.40 --> 00:57:08.84
I've moved five pictures of what am I now going to find in there

319
00:57:08.84 --> 00:57:12.12
that's going to improve the file.

320
00:57:12.12 --> 00:57:16.44
So I went through my computer screen just going through the pictures

321
00:57:16.44 --> 00:57:20.12
and thinking, oh, do you know what?

322
00:57:20.12 --> 00:57:25.12
I really wish that I'd spend it in a more time shooting that moment

323
00:57:25.12 --> 00:57:27.16
because I'd shot it until, actually, you know what?

324
00:57:27.16 --> 00:57:30.52
I'm going to get something a bit stronger than that in a minute.

325
00:57:30.52 --> 00:57:33.92
So I just, and I saw, and then I'd see another image.

326
00:57:33.92 --> 00:57:36.64
And I'd work it through and I think, OK, I think the fourth image

327
00:57:36.64 --> 00:57:38.20
in this sequence is going to be the one.

328
00:57:38.20 --> 00:57:40.64
And then I realized there wasn't the fourth image.

329
00:57:40.64 --> 00:57:45.20
And I just kept saying, oh, so what were you doing?

330
00:57:45.20 --> 00:57:48.92
And of course, at the time, I had no idea that this was going to be

331
00:57:48.92 --> 00:57:51.44
the number one story in the world.

332
00:57:51.44 --> 00:57:53.000
And so I ended up moving.

333
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.28
I think I ended up moving maybe 15 pictures, maybe more from this.

334
00:57:57.28 --> 00:58:00.24
And every time I put a picture, I thought, you know,

335
00:58:00.24 --> 00:58:00.68
what?

336
00:58:00.68 --> 00:58:03.88
And it just so annoyed me that I hadn't.

337
00:58:03.88 --> 00:58:08.76
Maybe approach the job as in the right manner.

338
00:58:08.76 --> 00:58:11.04
I just had seen the light.

339
00:58:11.04 --> 00:58:13.88
And I'd shot what I thought would be really strong.

340
00:58:13.88 --> 00:58:16.40
And like I say, you know, in my career,

341
00:58:16.40 --> 00:58:18.72
I miss as many pictures as I get.

342
00:58:18.72 --> 00:58:20.52
In fact, I miss more than I get.

343
00:58:20.52 --> 00:58:24.28
And I can tell you about all the great pictures I didn't take.

344
00:58:24.28 --> 00:58:26.68
And that would make a great book.

345
00:58:26.68 --> 00:58:32.16
But so I was just really angry with myself and angry that I'd

346
00:58:32.16 --> 00:58:35.04
had this opportunity and I'd maybe blown it.

347
00:58:35.04 --> 00:58:36.92
And I thought, well, this is why I'm here.

348
00:58:36.92 --> 00:58:38.28
I'm here to shoot this.

349
00:58:38.28 --> 00:58:40.92
I'm here to show the world that this is why this is what's

350
00:58:40.92 --> 00:58:41.40
happening.

351
00:58:41.40 --> 00:58:47.16
And how could I have been so stupid as to not have concentrated

352
00:58:47.16 --> 00:58:48.48
a little bit harder while I was there?

353
00:58:48.48 --> 00:58:51.08
And I know we only had half an hour to 40 minutes.

354
00:58:51.08 --> 00:58:54.04
But still, I could have shot five times as much in that time.

355
00:58:54.04 --> 00:58:54.64
But I didn't.

356
00:58:54.64 --> 00:58:58.32
I just chose to meticulously walk through pick my moments

357
00:58:58.32 --> 00:58:59.52
and shoot them.

358
00:58:59.52 --> 00:59:02.36
So we moved these pictures and fortunately the next day,

359
00:59:02.36 --> 00:59:07.56
I think one of the, it was an image of a woman

360
00:59:07.56 --> 00:59:11.88
in a walking past a skull that was just,

361
00:59:11.88 --> 00:59:13.96
and I shot it from really low down on the ground.

362
00:59:13.96 --> 00:59:15.36
And it was really up and upright.

363
00:59:15.36 --> 00:59:16.96
And that's what suited most of the papers

364
00:59:16.96 --> 00:59:19.20
as an upright image of vertical.

365
00:59:19.20 --> 00:59:23.60
And that was what got used on all the New York Times,

366
00:59:23.60 --> 00:59:26.04
everywhere, the just the Washington Post,

367
00:59:26.04 --> 00:59:28.64
all the British newspapers, everywhere around the world,

368
00:59:28.64 --> 00:59:30.72
had run with this story.

369
00:59:30.72 --> 00:59:32.92
And although we were the first guy there,

370
00:59:32.92 --> 00:59:34.44
there were a couple of other photographers

371
00:59:34.44 --> 00:59:36.40
that were there at the time with me,

372
00:59:36.40 --> 00:59:41.48
but they didn't work for an international wire agency.

373
00:59:41.48 --> 00:59:42.60
And that's the beauty about working

374
00:59:42.60 --> 00:59:45.28
for an international wire agency is that they're rich

375
00:59:45.28 --> 00:59:46.08
and they're clout.

376
00:59:46.08 --> 00:59:47.80
It's just phenomenal.

377
00:59:47.80 --> 00:59:49.76
It doesn't matter whether you're working for a newspaper,

378
00:59:49.76 --> 00:59:52.000
but as soon as you work for an international wire agency,

379
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.08
particularly one as good as Royce's,

380
00:59:54.08 --> 00:59:57.68
you then realize actually,

381
00:59:57.68 --> 00:59:58.84
when I've got this picture,

382
00:59:58.84 --> 01:00:01.04
it's really gonna get out there.

383
01:00:01.04 --> 01:00:03.52
Everybody is gonna see it, you know?

384
01:00:03.52 --> 01:00:05.44
And that's a huge buzz.

385
01:00:06.88 --> 01:00:09.44
And it did, and it made,

386
01:00:09.44 --> 01:00:11.28
the play was incredible.

387
01:00:11.28 --> 01:00:14.56
And then my chief said to me,

388
01:00:14.56 --> 01:00:16.40
okay, Kirin, well, you know where you're going back

389
01:00:16.40 --> 01:00:17.80
to tomorrow.

390
01:00:17.80 --> 01:00:20.12
And again, I thought, yeah, but you know what,

391
01:00:20.12 --> 01:00:22.48
I've just been there.

392
01:00:22.48 --> 01:00:25.48
And I had pretty much the place to myself.

393
01:00:25.48 --> 01:00:27.36
And I knew going down the next day

394
01:00:27.36 --> 01:00:30.08
when I drove there, it was a zoo.

395
01:00:30.08 --> 01:00:31.64
There was just every photographer

396
01:00:31.64 --> 01:00:36.08
and every cameraman in Iraq was at Hilla.

397
01:00:36.08 --> 01:00:39.84
And you couldn't shoot anything

398
01:00:39.84 --> 01:00:41.44
without getting another photographer

399
01:00:41.44 --> 01:00:43.72
or a cameraman or a sound boom

400
01:00:43.72 --> 01:00:44.92
because of the,

401
01:00:44.92 --> 01:00:47.76
and I think I did take a couple of pictures that day,

402
01:00:47.76 --> 01:00:50.04
some very strong, a couple of strong pictures

403
01:00:50.04 --> 01:00:52.08
of a woman that I just discovered a husband

404
01:00:52.08 --> 01:00:53.68
and she was surrounded by a family.

405
01:00:53.68 --> 01:00:58.68
And the pain of every photographer's life

406
01:00:59.08 --> 01:01:01.20
is the sound man's boom.

407
01:01:02.76 --> 01:01:05.52
And this woman was making this,

408
01:01:07.20 --> 01:01:08.96
she was, it was a stressful way.

409
01:01:08.96 --> 01:01:10.04
I mean, I still remember it now.

410
01:01:10.04 --> 01:01:10.88
It was awful.

411
01:01:10.88 --> 01:01:12.60
The noise she was making,

412
01:01:12.60 --> 01:01:15.08
it was really guttural.

413
01:01:15.08 --> 01:01:18.12
And it really went right through

414
01:01:18.12 --> 01:01:22.28
and I remember being really down low and in close

415
01:01:22.28 --> 01:01:23.64
and trying to photograph this

416
01:01:23.64 --> 01:01:27.84
and the next thing, this furry boom just comes over, microphone.

417
01:01:27.84 --> 01:01:30.32
And he's trying to record the sound.

418
01:01:31.80 --> 01:01:33.000
And that's what it was like.

419
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.80
And you're getting annoyed at a sound man

420
01:01:34.80 --> 01:01:37.20
who's just stepped in and trying to do something

421
01:01:37.20 --> 01:01:38.36
when you were trying it and you think,

422
01:01:38.36 --> 01:01:40.000
and I'm getting annoyed with a guy

423
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.04
who's trying to record a woman who's

424
01:01:42.04 --> 01:01:45.48
and plumbing the depth of grief.

425
01:01:45.48 --> 01:01:48.08
And I'm annoyed at him and I'm not thinking, well listen,

426
01:01:48.08 --> 01:01:49.04
what about her?

427
01:01:49.04 --> 01:01:50.68
You know, and in those situations

428
01:01:50.68 --> 01:01:51.84
you're not thinking about that,

429
01:01:51.84 --> 01:01:55.20
you'll just, I need to shoot this picture.

430
01:01:55.20 --> 01:01:58.36
So yep, the next day it was a zoo.

431
01:01:58.36 --> 01:02:01.48
And but I was able to stand back and think,

432
01:02:01.48 --> 01:02:05.36
you know, I got lucky yesterday.

433
01:02:06.64 --> 01:02:08.80
And I learned a really valuable lesson,

434
01:02:08.80 --> 01:02:12.84
which is going to every situation like that

435
01:02:12.84 --> 01:02:15.96
as if you're never gonna see a situation like that again.

436
01:02:15.96 --> 01:02:17.84
I mean, actually even further back,

437
01:02:17.84 --> 01:02:19.16
there was a chance that you could have said,

438
01:02:19.16 --> 01:02:20.84
I know we can't make it, we won't be home

439
01:02:20.84 --> 01:02:23.04
before dark so we're just gonna head back back there.

440
01:02:23.04 --> 01:02:25.08
And of course, but that's right.

441
01:02:25.08 --> 01:02:27.08
And but ultimately in that car,

442
01:02:27.08 --> 01:02:30.92
that wasn't, that probably wasn't gonna be my call.

443
01:02:30.92 --> 01:02:33.88
So the somebody in the car,

444
01:02:33.88 --> 01:02:35.40
and I think I was with three or four others,

445
01:02:35.40 --> 01:02:36.72
somebody at the maybe the journalist

446
01:02:36.72 --> 01:02:38.68
might have been the most senior in the,

447
01:02:38.68 --> 01:02:39.56
in the, in the, in the,

448
01:02:39.56 --> 01:02:41.44
I'm to vehicle at the time and she would have made that call.

449
01:02:41.44 --> 01:02:43.04
And she would have just said, listen,

450
01:02:43.04 --> 01:02:46.84
if this is what they want, we need to go under, you know.

451
01:02:46.84 --> 01:02:50.64
So yep, it came out, okay, at the end,

452
01:02:50.64 --> 01:02:53.48
but it was, that was close.

453
01:02:53.48 --> 01:02:56.52
And I had a, whatever, when I was in my first seal

454
01:02:56.52 --> 01:03:01.52
up until my leading petty officer who is the senior,

455
01:03:02.60 --> 01:03:03.60
well, not even the senior,

456
01:03:03.60 --> 01:03:04.88
but the second senior of the,

457
01:03:04.88 --> 01:03:07.92
listed guys anyways, he had this,

458
01:03:07.92 --> 01:03:12.92
this mantra and the mantra was always go out.

459
01:03:12.92 --> 01:03:15.12
Now when he said always go out,

460
01:03:15.12 --> 01:03:18.52
what he meant was always go out to the barn.

461
01:03:18.52 --> 01:03:20.44
Always go out, you know,

462
01:03:20.44 --> 01:03:22.44
you can, you pull in somewhere for a night, go out,

463
01:03:22.44 --> 01:03:23.72
you know, that's always go out.

464
01:03:23.72 --> 01:03:25.40
There's always some fun to be had.

465
01:03:25.40 --> 01:03:29.20
And I actually, my mind, I always twisted that mantra

466
01:03:29.20 --> 01:03:32.28
from his always go out to go to the bar

467
01:03:32.28 --> 01:03:34.40
or go to the club.

468
01:03:34.40 --> 01:03:37.56
I changed it to just always go out period.

469
01:03:37.56 --> 01:03:39.08
So if there's an opportunity,

470
01:03:39.08 --> 01:03:40.64
there's an operation coming, go out.

471
01:03:40.64 --> 01:03:42.68
If there's a, if you, if there's a bar to go to,

472
01:03:42.68 --> 01:03:43.52
go out.

473
01:03:43.52 --> 01:03:45.72
If there's something to do, go and do it.

474
01:03:45.72 --> 01:03:47.44
It's just a little, you know,

475
01:03:47.44 --> 01:03:48.76
a little something to think about.

476
01:03:48.76 --> 01:03:50.24
And remind when you're sitting there saying,

477
01:03:50.24 --> 01:03:52.68
and you know, maybe, maybe wouldn't have been your call,

478
01:03:52.68 --> 01:03:55.48
but if it was your call, maybe would have sluffed it off.

479
01:03:55.48 --> 01:03:56.96
And if you had the attitude, if you know what,

480
01:03:56.96 --> 01:03:58.08
always go out.

481
01:03:58.08 --> 01:03:58.92
Okay.

482
01:03:58.92 --> 01:04:01.08
Then you would have been there 100%.

483
01:04:01.08 --> 01:04:01.92
Yeah.

484
01:04:01.92 --> 01:04:02.76
Yeah.

485
01:04:02.76 --> 01:04:03.60
Absolutely.

486
01:04:04.72 --> 01:04:05.72
And, and,

487
01:04:07.96 --> 01:04:11.60
you get, I don't want to cut, I rack short,

488
01:04:11.60 --> 01:04:13.56
but at the same time, there's so much stuff

489
01:04:13.56 --> 01:04:16.12
I want to talk to you about and hear other people

490
01:04:16.12 --> 01:04:21.12
talk about, but you get home from Iraq.

491
01:04:21.12 --> 01:04:26.12
And, you go back to your kind of normal day to day.

492
01:04:28.44 --> 01:04:30.12
You said you were, you saw some stuff,

493
01:04:30.12 --> 01:04:33.40
but it wasn't like a major psychological effect

494
01:04:33.40 --> 01:04:34.92
that you noticed out of the gate.

495
01:04:34.92 --> 01:04:37.52
You came home, hey, that was my job, I did my job.

496
01:04:40.04 --> 01:04:45.04
Next call you get, big call, is to go to Sri Lanka,

497
01:04:45.04 --> 01:04:47.44
which you mentioned briefly there.

498
01:04:47.44 --> 01:04:52.04
And in Sri Lanka, you were going because of the horrible tsunami

499
01:04:52.04 --> 01:04:55.04
that hit on boxing day in Americans,

500
01:04:55.04 --> 01:04:56.04
don't know what boxing day is.

501
01:04:56.04 --> 01:04:58.04
That's a day after Christmas in England.

502
01:04:58.04 --> 01:05:02.04
You know, boxing day, and you get the call

503
01:05:02.04 --> 01:05:06.04
to go out to Sri Lanka and shoot.

504
01:05:08.04 --> 01:05:14.04
Yeah, that was some, I remember the, the, the,

505
01:05:14.04 --> 01:05:19.04
the, the desk working on boxing day called me.

506
01:05:19.04 --> 01:05:21.04
And I was around at my parents with my kids.

507
01:05:21.04 --> 01:05:25.04
And we were all just about to start opening Christmas presents.

508
01:05:25.04 --> 01:05:29.04
And, um, she said,

509
01:05:29.04 --> 01:05:32.04
here, you need to get on a plane and you need to go to Columbus,

510
01:05:32.04 --> 01:05:35.04
literally, um, straight away.

511
01:05:35.04 --> 01:05:38.04
And I said, uh, why?

512
01:05:38.04 --> 01:05:40.04
And she said, well, I've been not heard.

513
01:05:40.04 --> 01:05:42.04
And I said, I heard what?

514
01:05:42.04 --> 01:05:43.04
And she said turn on the TV.

515
01:05:43.04 --> 01:05:45.04
So I turned on the TV.

516
01:05:45.04 --> 01:05:49.04
And, uh, yeah, it was like a 9-11 moment,

517
01:05:49.04 --> 01:05:52.04
you know, when you're sitting and you're looking, you just think,

518
01:05:52.04 --> 01:05:54.04
I had no idea.

519
01:05:54.04 --> 01:05:59.04
And, uh, and by the way, just to just to kind of give some basic facts on this,

520
01:05:59.04 --> 01:06:07.04
the tsunami that hit the Indian Ocean had the approximate energy of 23,000

521
01:06:07.04 --> 01:06:14.04
hero shima atomic bombs.

522
01:06:14.04 --> 01:06:14.04
It was a magnitude 9.0.

523
01:06:14.04 --> 01:06:17.04
The rupture was 600 miles long.

524
01:06:17.04 --> 01:06:22.04
It displaced the sea floor by 10 yards.

525
01:06:22.04 --> 01:06:24.04
600 miles 10 yards.

526
01:06:24.04 --> 01:06:31.04
So, uh, trillions of trillions of tons of rocks moved.

527
01:06:31.04 --> 01:06:34.04
It's the largest earthquake in 40 years.

528
01:06:34.04 --> 01:06:38.04
And within hours, the killer waves started arriving.

529
01:06:38.04 --> 01:06:43.04
And unfortunately, because of lack of communication and no warning systems in place,

530
01:06:43.04 --> 01:06:47.04
people were just not, they weren't prepared for it throughout Asia.

531
01:06:47.04 --> 01:06:50.04
And they just got crushed.

532
01:06:50.04 --> 01:06:52.04
Absolutely crushed.

533
01:06:52.04 --> 01:06:56.04
And, uh, you know, you said a 9-11 moment, which I understand where you're coming from,

534
01:06:56.04 --> 01:07:03.04
from a psychological standpoint of, hey, I know what I was doing at this point on September 11,

535
01:07:03.04 --> 01:07:10.04
well, September 11th was 4,000, maybe 5,000 Americans killed.

536
01:07:10.04 --> 01:07:14.04
The tsunami resulted in almost a quarter million dead.

537
01:07:14.04 --> 01:07:18.04
I mean, just a massive destruction.

538
01:07:18.04 --> 01:07:21.04
And you got the call.

539
01:07:21.04 --> 01:07:23.04
So you got the call.

540
01:07:23.04 --> 01:07:27.04
And it just happened to be because I was the guy on call.

541
01:07:27.04 --> 01:07:28.04
Oh, okay.

542
01:07:28.04 --> 01:07:32.04
So it could have gone to any photographer in London.

543
01:07:32.04 --> 01:07:36.04
So, and they, they roaches head sort of,

544
01:07:36.04 --> 01:07:39.04
there were photographers that had gone to Bandar at Cheyenne,

545
01:07:39.04 --> 01:07:45.04
and other places, and they needed somebody to go to Sri Lanka because they had an idea that Sri Lanka had been pretty badly hit.

546
01:07:45.04 --> 01:07:49.04
And because it was my name on the scared for boxing day, that's why I got the call.

547
01:07:49.04 --> 01:07:53.04
And I ended up going out the following, I think it was the 27th.

548
01:07:53.04 --> 01:07:54.04
I flew out.

549
01:07:54.04 --> 01:08:00.04
And, uh, yeah, just one of those stories where you have to hit the ground running.

550
01:08:00.04 --> 01:08:04.04
So you're off the plane, you get three customs, and you're straight into a car,

551
01:08:04.04 --> 01:08:08.04
and you're into the office, and you're speaking to the bureau chief there.

552
01:08:08.04 --> 01:08:10.04
And you say, right, I'm here.

553
01:08:10.04 --> 01:08:12.04
So where am I going?

554
01:08:12.04 --> 01:08:16.04
And they are still trying to figure out what's happened,

555
01:08:16.04 --> 01:08:20.04
and where the, you know, the most severe damages,

556
01:08:20.04 --> 01:08:24.04
and pretty much, you know, most of the coastline of Sri Lanka had been hit.

557
01:08:24.04 --> 01:08:28.04
So it didn't really matter where you went.

558
01:08:28.04 --> 01:08:30.04
You were always going to find something.

559
01:08:30.04 --> 01:08:34.04
So they were trying to, I said, I really want to get over to the other coast.

560
01:08:34.04 --> 01:08:37.04
I don't want to get over to this stay here where all the tourists come.

561
01:08:37.04 --> 01:08:39.04
I want to get over to the other side.

562
01:08:39.04 --> 01:08:43.04
So we were literally trying to find a helicopter that would get me straight over there.

563
01:08:43.04 --> 01:08:45.04
But in the meantime, while they were trying to work that out,

564
01:08:45.04 --> 01:08:49.04
I just got in the car and I just drove down from kind of just straight down through gold

565
01:08:49.04 --> 01:08:51.04
to just see what was going on.

566
01:08:51.04 --> 01:08:55.04
And again, to get something under my belt, and I just started shooting.

567
01:08:55.04 --> 01:08:58.04
And then came back to the office.

568
01:08:58.04 --> 01:09:00.04
How did you have your business really awkward before?

569
01:09:00.04 --> 01:09:01.04
I'd never been trying to.

570
01:09:01.04 --> 01:09:02.04
No.

571
01:09:02.04 --> 01:09:10.04
So, got back to the office, and I said, listen, what's happening with the chopper?

572
01:09:10.04 --> 01:09:12.04
They said, well, you know, it's not really happening,

573
01:09:12.04 --> 01:09:15.04
but there might be a government minister that's going to go across.

574
01:09:15.04 --> 01:09:17.04
So myself and a journalist go in the car,

575
01:09:17.04 --> 01:09:19.04
we went to the government minister's office.

576
01:09:19.04 --> 01:09:24.04
And he was going to get in the chopper and get over.

577
01:09:24.04 --> 01:09:27.04
To the other side, the other coastline.

578
01:09:27.04 --> 01:09:31.04
But before he did that, we were going to sit down and have lunch.

579
01:09:31.04 --> 01:09:34.04
And I was just thinking, okay, listen, do you know what?

580
01:09:34.04 --> 01:09:37.04
I really don't want to sit here and have lunch.

581
01:09:37.04 --> 01:09:41.04
Why don't we just get in that chopper and get going?

582
01:09:41.04 --> 01:09:44.04
But we had to go through this whole ring roll.

583
01:09:44.04 --> 01:09:49.04
And then eventually we got to the chopper and we got up for about three minutes.

584
01:09:49.04 --> 01:09:51.04
And a storm from came in.

585
01:09:51.04 --> 01:09:53.04
Chopper came back down.

586
01:09:53.04 --> 01:09:55.04
So that was that avenue of getting across.

587
01:09:55.04 --> 01:09:57.04
And we would have been there in an hour.

588
01:09:57.04 --> 01:09:59.04
So we had to work out another way.

589
01:09:59.04 --> 01:10:04.04
So we drove to Candy in one of those.

590
01:10:04.04 --> 01:10:08.04
We found a car, a guy who drove us from Columbia.

591
01:10:08.04 --> 01:10:12.04
Drivers all the way through the centre of Shalanko to Candy.

592
01:10:12.04 --> 01:10:13.04
And we got to Candy.

593
01:10:13.04 --> 01:10:15.04
And I remember that was New Year's Eve.

594
01:10:15.04 --> 01:10:18.04
When we got there, myself and the journalist.

595
01:10:18.04 --> 01:10:20.04
And the coincident with the journalist that was with me,

596
01:10:20.04 --> 01:10:23.04
she was flying back from a holiday.

597
01:10:23.04 --> 01:10:25.04
And she'd heard about the tsunami and she stopped off.

598
01:10:25.04 --> 01:10:29.04
And she was a lobby journalist that worked for Reuters.

599
01:10:29.04 --> 01:10:33.04
But so she was used to dealing with the politicians.

600
01:10:33.04 --> 01:10:37.04
And she just said, listen, I'm a journalist and I need to,

601
01:10:37.04 --> 01:10:39.04
This is a story that I need to cover.

602
01:10:39.04 --> 01:10:42.04
So she came in and she said, listen.

603
01:10:42.04 --> 01:10:45.04
And I knew her and I said, wow, what are you doing here?

604
01:10:45.04 --> 01:10:48.04
And she said, wow, can I be of help?

605
01:10:48.04 --> 01:10:50.04
So I said, let's go.

606
01:10:50.04 --> 01:10:53.04
You know, we got in this car and we went.

607
01:10:53.04 --> 01:11:00.04
And she had such an amazingly fresh take on a story like that.

608
01:11:00.04 --> 01:11:07.04
Purely because she was used to covering lobby and back in the UK.

609
01:11:07.04 --> 01:11:10.04
And because she wasn't a seasoned sort of,

610
01:11:10.04 --> 01:11:14.04
I don't know, hostile environment journalist.

611
01:11:14.04 --> 01:11:17.04
The way she would write stories and find stories was just like,

612
01:11:17.04 --> 01:11:19.04
you just wouldn't have got it from a, you know,

613
01:11:19.04 --> 01:11:22.04
she just had a completely different angle on it.

614
01:11:22.04 --> 01:11:28.04
So it was so refreshing to work with someone who just saw everything from a completely different viewpoint.

615
01:11:28.04 --> 01:11:33.04
Everything was new to her, but that meant that her writing and everything was really fresh and vibrant.

616
01:11:33.04 --> 01:11:35.04
So she was an absolute pleasure to work with.

617
01:11:35.04 --> 01:11:38.04
And we sort of just teamed up and we got to the other side.

618
01:11:38.04 --> 01:11:40.04
And as soon as we got to the other coast,

619
01:11:40.04 --> 01:11:45.04
it flooded the whole area flooded,

620
01:11:45.04 --> 01:11:49.04
which meant no one could get in to that side of Sri Lanka.

621
01:11:49.04 --> 01:11:53.04
And we had that place to ourselves for over a week.

622
01:11:53.04 --> 01:11:57.04
And we were staying in a hotel where the floors were just to feed high and water.

623
01:11:57.04 --> 01:12:01.04
I mean, but they still managed to get us rice every night.

624
01:12:01.04 --> 01:12:04.04
I mean, it was just incredible how these people just managed.

625
01:12:04.04 --> 01:12:06.04
And of course you get out there in your,

626
01:12:06.04 --> 01:12:10.04
you're, you're okay, right, where do we go?

627
01:12:10.04 --> 01:12:14.04
So let's just walk down to the coastline and let's just see what the situation is.

628
01:12:14.04 --> 01:12:17.04
And of course, you go down as a,

629
01:12:17.04 --> 01:12:21.04
as a Westerner and these people just think that you're,

630
01:12:21.04 --> 01:12:22.04
you can help them.

631
01:12:22.04 --> 01:12:25.04
So they're coming up when they're showing you documentation in their passports.

632
01:12:25.04 --> 01:12:27.04
And can you take this to the American embassy?

633
01:12:27.04 --> 01:12:28.04
And can we get off the country?

634
01:12:28.04 --> 01:12:32.04
And I have, I have relatives that live in the UK and relatives that live in America.

635
01:12:32.04 --> 01:12:33.04
And I can leave.

636
01:12:33.04 --> 01:12:37.04
And you, I've never felt so helpless in my life.

637
01:12:37.04 --> 01:12:39.04
Never felt so helpless.

638
01:12:39.04 --> 01:12:44.04
And I've spent a fair amount of time in Sri Lanka back in the day.

639
01:12:44.04 --> 01:12:48.04
And the Sri Lankan people are just the nicest,

640
01:12:48.04 --> 01:12:49.04
yeah, absolutely.

641
01:12:49.04 --> 01:12:52.04
Kindest, but hard working, I mean,

642
01:12:52.04 --> 01:12:58.04
just it's just a beautiful, and a country side itself is absolutely stunning, beautiful.

643
01:12:58.04 --> 01:13:01.04
And so I can imagine them doing going,

644
01:13:01.04 --> 01:13:05.04
jumping through hoops and doing what I had to do to get you a bowl of rice when you came home.

645
01:13:05.04 --> 01:13:07.04
Yeah, it is a shame to get her to go.

646
01:13:07.04 --> 01:13:11.04
And then you would meet the people that were living on the beach,

647
01:13:11.04 --> 01:13:16.04
their homes are on the beach, and they've been hit by the wave.

648
01:13:16.04 --> 01:13:20.04
And they were just immediately rebuilding.

649
01:13:20.04 --> 01:13:23.04
It was just, okay, listen, this is what we've got to do.

650
01:13:23.04 --> 01:13:25.04
And they start rebuilding.

651
01:13:25.04 --> 01:13:31.04
And I'll never forget wandering around at that point on the tip,

652
01:13:31.04 --> 01:13:33.04
on the east and tip.

653
01:13:33.04 --> 01:13:39.04
And I found just it was a wall, just a wall left of a house.

654
01:13:39.04 --> 01:13:41.04
So I imagine it was the wall where there was the door,

655
01:13:41.04 --> 01:13:45.04
and everything else had gone, it was one brick wall just standing up his own.

656
01:13:45.04 --> 01:13:48.04
And if you sort of walked through this door,

657
01:13:48.04 --> 01:13:52.04
you just saw Golden Sand and Pantry,

658
01:13:52.04 --> 01:13:54.04
and there was a dresser.

659
01:13:54.04 --> 01:13:57.04
Just a one wooden dresser against this back wall.

660
01:13:57.04 --> 01:14:00.04
And the young guy came up to me and he'd said,

661
01:14:00.04 --> 01:14:06.04
you're photography and where are you from and the usual.

662
01:14:06.04 --> 01:14:09.04
And I sort of got chatting to him and he said,

663
01:14:09.04 --> 01:14:11.04
can I get you a drink?

664
01:14:11.04 --> 01:14:13.04
And I said, and then listen, I'm fine.

665
01:14:13.04 --> 01:14:15.04
Seriously, don't worry about it.

666
01:14:15.04 --> 01:14:17.04
I'm absolutely fine, but thank you.

667
01:14:17.04 --> 01:14:19.04
He said, no, no, no, listen, I can run to the store,

668
01:14:19.04 --> 01:14:21.04
which was about a mile in land.

669
01:14:21.04 --> 01:14:24.04
Yeah, and I can get you a diet, coke, or a coke, whatever it is.

670
01:14:24.04 --> 01:14:28.04
I said, please listen, I'm, I'm, seriously, I'm absolutely fine.

671
01:14:28.04 --> 01:14:31.04
He said, okay, well, please sit and he pulled up a crate,

672
01:14:31.04 --> 01:14:37.04
and we just sat it down and I'm sitting in what used to be his main room of his house.

673
01:14:37.04 --> 01:14:42.04
And he puts, let's get to the crate and let's me sit on it.

674
01:14:42.04 --> 01:14:45.04
And then he just shimmies up the coke and up tree,

675
01:14:45.04 --> 01:14:48.04
and he just pulls a coke and up off the top of the tree,

676
01:14:48.04 --> 01:14:49.04
shimmies back down.

677
01:14:49.04 --> 01:14:53.04
And I'm thinking, and I really don't like coke and up there.

678
01:14:53.04 --> 01:14:56.04
I mean, I, but because it really doesn't agree with me,

679
01:14:56.04 --> 01:15:00.04
so I just thought, okay, but you know, he's gone to this effort.

680
01:15:00.04 --> 01:15:02.04
So he cut down this and he took the top off,

681
01:15:02.04 --> 01:15:04.04
and then he went to the dresser,

682
01:15:04.04 --> 01:15:10.04
and he opened the drawer and he pulled out a tiny silver platter.

683
01:15:10.04 --> 01:15:12.04
And he put the coke in it on the platter,

684
01:15:12.04 --> 01:15:14.04
and then he handed it to me.

685
01:15:14.04 --> 01:15:18.04
And he'd even got a straw, and he put a straw in it.

686
01:15:18.04 --> 01:15:21.04
And he said, please, you know, you're in my home.

687
01:15:21.04 --> 01:15:26.04
And I'm looking at the one wall that's left of his home with his dresser.

688
01:15:26.04 --> 01:15:29.04
And so I take a sip of this drink and I said,

689
01:15:29.04 --> 01:15:34.04
so tell me, what, I mean, this is your home.

690
01:15:34.04 --> 01:15:38.04
I mean, you know, the water was 25 feet away.

691
01:15:38.04 --> 01:15:40.04
There's the golden sand I said, what happened.

692
01:15:40.04 --> 01:15:44.04
And he said, the wave came in and destroyed my house.

693
01:15:44.04 --> 01:15:48.04
And it took away my parents, my wife,

694
01:15:48.04 --> 01:15:53.04
my brothers and sisters and my six kids, they're gone.

695
01:15:53.04 --> 01:16:01.04
And all I can think of is that he has tried to find some way for me to sit.

696
01:16:01.04 --> 01:16:05.04
It's gone up a tree to get me a coconut and put it on the silver platter.

697
01:16:05.04 --> 01:16:10.04
The only thing that's left in his house is this chest of drawers,

698
01:16:10.04 --> 01:16:12.04
or the dresser with a silver platter in it.

699
01:16:12.04 --> 01:16:16.04
And he's more concerned about my welfare at that moment.

700
01:16:16.04 --> 01:16:20.04
And this is what had happened to him about five days earlier.

701
01:16:20.04 --> 01:16:26.04
And I remember thinking, when I got back from Shalainka,

702
01:16:26.04 --> 01:16:30.04
I couldn't stop thinking about that conversation.

703
01:16:30.04 --> 01:16:34.04
And I think that was the time when it really hit me.

704
01:16:34.04 --> 01:16:37.04
It really hit me about what had happened.

705
01:16:37.04 --> 01:16:42.04
And I can't even begin to describe.

706
01:16:42.04 --> 01:16:46.04
I think I had a numbness, similar to the sort of numbness that I had in Iraq.

707
01:16:46.04 --> 01:16:54.04
But this was a different kind of numbness because the thing about the tsunami was you were dealing with the living.

708
01:16:54.04 --> 01:16:57.04
And it was the living that affected you.

709
01:16:57.04 --> 01:17:03.04
It wasn't the death and it wasn't the bodies that had been swept.

710
01:17:03.04 --> 01:17:07.04
A mile in land and ended up in people's houses and stuff like that.

711
01:17:07.04 --> 01:17:13.04
It wasn't the way you would cover the funnels of all the different religious types there.

712
01:17:13.04 --> 01:17:19.04
You just, it's when you're speaking to the people that survived that you,

713
01:17:19.04 --> 01:17:22.04
it was a real, a real living.

714
01:17:22.04 --> 01:17:29.04
And well, that just about sums up my, you know, that story about that guy.

715
01:17:29.04 --> 01:17:35.04
I mean, first of all, anybody that hears that story has to think to themselves,

716
01:17:35.04 --> 01:17:41.04
you know, am I really doing the best I can to number one, have a positive attitude.

717
01:17:41.04 --> 01:17:43.04
Number two, put other people before me.

718
01:17:43.04 --> 01:17:45.04
I mean, what a, what a, what a saint.

719
01:17:45.04 --> 01:17:47.04
I mean, that's just unbelievable.

720
01:17:47.04 --> 01:17:49.04
And I remember actually as you were telling that story.

721
01:17:49.04 --> 01:17:53.04
I remember that when I was in Sri Lanka, there was guys that, you know,

722
01:17:53.04 --> 01:17:55.04
they've been fighting in war against the Tamile Tigers for many years.

723
01:17:55.04 --> 01:17:58.04
And so we, that's who we were working with these guys.

724
01:17:58.04 --> 01:18:03.04
And they would, they would be telling these war stories with,

725
01:18:03.04 --> 01:18:06.04
and they'd be showing you, you know, there's a guy that couldn't move his arm.

726
01:18:06.04 --> 01:18:08.04
He got shot in the arm with an AK-47.

727
01:18:08.04 --> 01:18:12.04
So now he was working as, like, a secretary in the, in the army.

728
01:18:12.04 --> 01:18:14.04
And he's just got this big smile on his face.

729
01:18:14.04 --> 01:18:18.04
And he's telling me, yeah, you know, and, and I, I got shot.

730
01:18:18.04 --> 01:18:22.04
And, and now my arm doesn't work, but, you know, being a secretary is a pretty,

731
01:18:22.04 --> 01:18:23.04
a pretty good job too.

732
01:18:23.04 --> 01:18:25.04
And, and it's just good to still be in the army.

733
01:18:25.04 --> 01:18:29.04
And you just have this, this, this, this feeling,

734
01:18:29.04 --> 01:18:31.04
it probably the similar feeling that you have.

735
01:18:31.04 --> 01:18:35.04
Just looking at these people and you're saying, how can you be so happy?

736
01:18:35.04 --> 01:18:37.04
Yeah, and why can't I be that?

737
01:18:37.04 --> 01:18:39.04
I want to be that happy.

738
01:18:39.04 --> 01:18:44.04
But this is, it's just so impressive and it puts everything in so much perspective.

739
01:18:44.04 --> 01:18:48.04
We're talking here about somebody that's lost that much.

740
01:18:48.04 --> 01:18:50.04
That's going to climb that tree.

741
01:18:50.04 --> 01:18:54.04
That's going to climb that tree for somebody else,

742
01:18:54.04 --> 01:18:56.04
even though they've lost everything themselves.

743
01:18:56.04 --> 01:18:57.04
It's humbling.

744
01:18:57.04 --> 01:19:00.04
So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, that, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so...

745
01:19:00.04 --> 01:19:09.54
So, when you came home and you know you tell me about this earlier and you were just kind of getting into it.

746
01:19:09.54 --> 01:19:20.04
I mean you felt like after Sri Lung you know you go to Iraq and you see the war and that's one thing and like you said you're dealing with the dead and you're seeing people that were killed.

747
01:19:20.04 --> 01:19:23.04
But now you're dealing with the what's left behind.

748
01:19:23.04 --> 01:19:32.04
And you said that that really had more of an impact on you than that I racked it or the Northern Island did.

749
01:19:32.04 --> 01:19:33.04
Yeah.

750
01:19:33.04 --> 01:19:36.04
Did you?

751
01:19:36.04 --> 01:19:39.04
How did you deal with that?

752
01:19:39.04 --> 01:19:50.04
Well, the Roitz's policy is that when you arrive back from a situation like that you'll line manager hands you at a number.

753
01:19:50.04 --> 01:19:55.04
You know quite discreetly and says there's a number there if you need to call it.

754
01:19:55.04 --> 01:20:03.04
And it says sort of a help line you know it's sort of you have talked to a professional about what you've been through and it's sort of way of as imagine in the outweigh be the debrief.

755
01:20:03.04 --> 01:20:09.04
It's sort of a thing you just sort of you get that you start to talk about what it is you and I don't know I've never been in a situation like that.

756
01:20:09.04 --> 01:20:13.04
So I don't know what happens but I remember thinking I'm fine.

757
01:20:13.04 --> 01:20:16.04
I don't need that at all.

758
01:20:16.04 --> 01:20:21.04
So again I couldn't have been more wrong.

759
01:20:21.04 --> 01:20:34.04
And I ended up I had nightmares for maybe a couple of years after it's really really bizarre nightmares that involved cameras and involved tidal waves.

760
01:20:34.04 --> 01:20:45.04
I mean that the sort of the mix that was going on I mean if I suppose if I sit down and talk to professional about it they might find it really interesting what was going on on my head.

761
01:20:45.04 --> 01:20:48.04
But I came back really angry.

762
01:20:48.04 --> 01:21:10.04
I remember coming back really angry for the main reason being that I was coming back to my comfortable home and I thought about those millionaires living on the river bank in London and I thought whatever happened if the terms suddenly went.

763
01:21:10.04 --> 01:21:22.04
It just completely flooded the barriers broke and just water just how would they the effort you wouldn't know what where to start you just wouldn't know what to do and you sit and these people.

764
01:21:22.04 --> 01:21:37.04
You know we have lots of floods in England now and what people go through I can understand is completely an utterly miserable but they're the carpets are being ruined and all this sort of stuff and yeah I wouldn't want to go through that but.

765
01:21:37.04 --> 01:21:50.04
You know when you when you compare that to what happens during a tsunami it's just you know night and day it really is and so I got angry about coming back to live in a comfortable house and.

766
01:21:50.04 --> 01:22:01.04
I used to get angry that my cellar flooded in strutum where I lived I had a big cellar where I had my drum kit and it flooded once and.

767
01:22:01.04 --> 01:22:08.04
My wife tear she was down there with my daughter and she was ended up pulling my drum kit out of.

768
01:22:08.04 --> 01:22:18.04
Three four inches of sewage water that come into and and I'm responsible for her hurting her back because she should never have done it but she was trying to get my.

769
01:22:18.04 --> 01:22:31.04
All my equipment off the floor and I remember being so angry that my cellar had flooded and then you go to something like Sri Lanka anything actually come on let's put this in perspective.

770
01:22:31.04 --> 01:22:40.04
So yeah the anger and I think it took a while to maybe if I take a nine manages advice and run out phone number.

771
01:22:40.04 --> 01:22:49.04
I might have been in a different place and it might have had you know I might have got to a different place a lot quicker but I didn't and I thought I can handle this and.

772
01:22:49.04 --> 01:22:59.04
And even while I wasn't handling it I didn't know I wasn't handling it you know I just thought this is normal that you come back from these events and just.

773
01:22:59.04 --> 01:23:13.04
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you're wife who is dealing with three really small kids and there's you in one year as you know given all this about your dreams and.

774
01:23:13.04 --> 01:23:23.04
You know flooding in this and there and I'm really annoyed and I should have stayed out there longer and why did they bring me back so early I had so many other stories lined up.

775
01:23:23.04 --> 01:23:29.04
And I course you know it then dawned on to me you know actually.

776
01:23:29.04 --> 01:23:30.04
My wife was my.

777
01:23:30.04 --> 01:23:38.04
Psychiatrist and to be fair she wasn't actually having to say anything she was just listening.

778
01:23:38.04 --> 01:23:47.04
And it was a case of me needing to just get all this stuff off my chest and I would just pick the bizarre as moments to do.

779
01:23:47.04 --> 01:23:58.04
And I had friends around and something would set me off and I don't know another thing you know and it was a bit like that.

780
01:23:58.04 --> 01:24:09.04
So yes I would say if maybe I'd been sort of clinically diagnosed they would have said you're suffering from some post traumatic stress.

781
01:24:09.04 --> 01:24:25.04
And I didn't experience that after a rock and I don't know why. I think maybe it was because I sort of wore as completely different to what you would maybe categorizes an active god so.

782
01:24:25.04 --> 01:24:45.04
That in a way I found quite interesting or was what happened when I got back from the tsunami a culmination of what happened in Iraq but I'd been to Iraq and at the end in between Iraq and the tsunami I had spent nine weeks in Australia for the graphing the rugby World Cup.

783
01:24:45.04 --> 01:24:59.04
And that was a pretty good gig and I'd had a great time. So there was that sort of huge job in between these other two huge jobs and I'm wondering maybe the distraction.

784
01:24:59.04 --> 01:25:12.04
Yeah had had helped you know maybe I was too busy thinking about something else I was nine weeks on a tour in Australia an amazing country having a great time shooting the rugby World Cup which England then went on to win.

785
01:25:12.04 --> 01:25:39.04
So yeah it was I don't know I really and to this day I'll never know but yeah dealing with that and it was interesting because I was working for the BBC in Dubai in 2010 and I was working with a producer and there was a series called Human Planet and I was out there shooting stills for the book that was going to come out with a series and we were out with this

786
01:25:39.04 --> 01:25:51.04
a volcano in Dubai a South African guy who trained for the end of the shoot and we were out and we were having a meal and the producer asked me he said oh

787
01:25:51.04 --> 01:26:07.04
I'm hearing you've got some incredible stories why don't you tell him the story about the tsunami. I thought well that's a really bizarre thing to start talking about at the end of a meal where we're celebrating finishing a shoot.

788
01:26:07.04 --> 01:26:17.04
But I obliged and I can't even remember I started talking and that they're just a whole table just went utter silence.

789
01:26:17.04 --> 01:26:35.04
I mean they were enthralled but in the end the producer came up to me after he said I'm really sorry that I asked you to talk about that because he said I can see that every time that you must talk about it you lose a piece of yourself.

790
01:26:35.04 --> 01:26:52.04
You know it's so entrenched in you that when you talk about it you're giving part of yourself away and he said I really apologize for that position and that had never occurred to me that was happening but he could tell that by watching how I was talking about it.

791
01:26:52.04 --> 01:27:11.04
I don't know if that's the case now but I don't tend to talk about it purely because it was 2004 and you know a lot has happened between then and now and so it's not something that I sit down with on a regular basis and talk to people about so.

792
01:27:11.04 --> 01:27:31.04
But I can imagine that even now probably at some point it's probably just a tiny bit maybe similar but not like it was closer but that was 2010 that was six years afterwards and he still spotted it was you know still very high in my sort of psyche.

793
01:27:31.04 --> 01:27:46.04
I think it's I think it's somewhat therapeutic to talk about the end and I think the more you talk if that guy asked you the same question once a week and you told that story once a week and you got more in depth with it and got your hands wrapped around it.

794
01:27:46.04 --> 01:28:00.04
I think that's good for you and you know they talk about that to the veterans in World War II when you when you came home from World War II first of all you've been at war for three or four years and when you came home you got on to a ship.

795
01:28:00.04 --> 01:28:27.04
I was just a little bit more in the middle of the war and then one day your doors up of 365 days you get on a plane and 24 hours later you're sitting in Main Street USA.

796
01:28:27.04 --> 01:28:51.04
I think that's what you said too when you told Tia you're lovely wife what was going on that's how you can talk about the things that you're talking about.

797
01:28:51.04 --> 01:29:09.04
I said too when you told Tia you're lovely wife what was going on that's how you know she did was listen she didn't have to she knows she had to do was listen and let you explain those thoughts.

798
01:29:09.04 --> 01:29:23.04
And then the next biggest I mean we've talked about a bunch of different things that you've done but one of the things and I always get drawn to things that I know a little bit about or something that I've seen.

799
01:29:23.04 --> 01:29:52.04
I was actually off the coast of Liberia in the late 90s when things were just going completely sideways and I pulled up a little article that captures some of the madness that was going on in Liberia doesn't article from the Guardian by Chris McGreal.

800
01:29:52.04 --> 01:29:56.04
What's the Guardians of UK site.

801
01:29:56.04 --> 01:30:07.04
A commander in Charles Taylor's Charles Taylor's malicious of Charles Taylor was this psychotic dictator of Liberia.

802
01:30:07.04 --> 01:30:21.04
Malicia has told a war crimes trial that the former Liberian president ordered his fighters to eat their enemies including UN peacekeepers as a means of terrorizing the population.

803
01:30:21.04 --> 01:30:36.04
Joseph zigzag marza chief of operations for Taylor who is on trial at the Hague also testified that he oversaw horrific crimes such as cutting the babies out of pregnant women.

804
01:30:36.04 --> 01:30:52.04
The former president told his men that their enemies are no longer human beings. Taylor 59 is pled not guilty to 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

805
01:30:52.04 --> 01:31:04.04
The government rebels in Sierra Leone which borders Liberia. Marza, this is his chief of operations who led the death squad of group of killers.

806
01:31:04.04 --> 01:31:28.04
Many of the victims of cannibalism were members of the crown people of the then Liberian president Samuel Doe who Taylor was attempting to overthrow.

807
01:31:28.04 --> 01:31:40.04
He said we could use them as pork to eat. Marza told the court, we ate a few echomog soldiers but not many, but many were executed about 68.

808
01:31:40.04 --> 01:31:47.04
He said Taylor said eating people set an example for the people to be afraid.

809
01:31:47.04 --> 01:32:02.04
There's defense lawyer asked Marza how the fighters would prepare a human being for the pot. The former commander described decapitating carving up cleaning and cooking corpses seasoned with salt and pepper.

810
01:32:02.04 --> 01:32:18.04
We slit your throat but your you throw away the head take the flesh and put it in a pot. Charles Taylor knows that said Marza. He told the court how rebel leaders who fell out with Taylor mediterrible end.

811
01:32:18.04 --> 01:32:32.04
The former commander described dismembering the body of another rebel leader known as Superman and then taking his hand to Taylor who gave him cigarette money and return.

812
01:32:32.04 --> 01:32:56.04
Marza said that he'd killed so many men women and children he had lost count. He described drowning and bloodshedding babies to death and murdering women with pen knives. He said when he was serving Taylor's rebel national patriotic front of Liberia he established checkpoints on roads using human intestines and severed heads mounted on sticks.

813
01:32:56.04 --> 01:33:06.04
As to whether Taylor knew about this Marza replied he was aware he made us understand that you have to play with human blood so that enemies would be afraid.

814
01:33:06.04 --> 01:33:14.04
As to how he felt about these actions now Marza said I regret nothing.

815
01:33:14.04 --> 01:33:41.04
Sorry I apologize that is our lifetime that is me this me sitting off the coast of Liberia while this was happening.

816
01:33:41.04 --> 01:34:02.04
It's just sick and I think Taylor was overthrown in 2003 obviously the country still bears the scars of that kind of darkness and evil.

817
01:34:02.04 --> 01:34:20.04
And that's something you talked about earlier was the fact that you're perspective and this is what I think I find very interesting about your perspective is that I'm always talking and exploring and studying the point of war where it's happening.

818
01:34:20.04 --> 01:34:35.04
And you end up in these places maybe you're a day behind maybe you're a week behind maybe you're a foot behind maybe you're a mile behind but you're seeing what the after effects of war is.

819
01:34:35.04 --> 01:34:51.04
And I think that that perspective for all of us to know is very important. So and I know you were there while you were there again I thought you were there in what year 2012.

820
01:34:51.04 --> 01:35:05.04
Yeah so this is I mean it was never it's never exactly going to be the most peaceful place in the world but it was relatively stable compared to when it was under Taylor.

821
01:35:05.04 --> 01:35:34.04
And I tell you this is one thing that when I when we're off the coast of Liberia and you're looking at the coast and you can see the coast we were literally maybe a couple miles offshore looking at the coast and I can see that there's waves breaking some kind of thinking you know I'm a surfer I'm thinking you know those look like good waves and then you can see there's build nice big kind of hotel you can see this beautiful white beach you can see it looks like a just beautiful place I'm thinking of myself.

822
01:35:34.04 --> 01:35:42.04
I need to go here on a on a surfer trip and then eventually you know I'm looking at this for a few hours we get a little bit closer starting to make out a little bit more.

823
01:35:42.04 --> 01:35:52.04
What I'm looking at and eventually I get out the big giant optics to to study where we might be landing and what's going on there.

824
01:35:52.04 --> 01:36:04.04
And when I look through these optics the whole picture changed because now you see all these buildings that look like they literally look like big beautiful you know beach.

825
01:36:04.04 --> 01:36:07.04
What's what's a big beach hotel called.

826
01:36:07.04 --> 01:36:26.04
Mwana surfer. Yeah something like the Mwana surfer. These big jet resorts. They look like these big giant resorts and as I put the big optics on them and sort of looking all the they're just completely gutted their destroyed it's just a nightmare and.

827
01:36:26.04 --> 01:36:41.04
It's so horrible to see such a beautiful place just completely destroyed by us by humans by fellow human beings have just completely destroyed it.

828
01:36:41.04 --> 01:36:50.04
What did you notice or what did you what was it like when you were there give us a debrief on 2012.

829
01:36:50.04 --> 01:37:01.04
I mean I just when you're mentioning those hotels I remember taking a trip out to the beaches and just walking along the beaches for a couple of hours and just looking at these places thinking.

830
01:37:01.04 --> 01:37:03.04
What's going on here.

831
01:37:03.04 --> 01:37:07.04
I mean my overriding.

832
01:37:07.04 --> 01:37:12.04
It's just that the country was just a viscerated. I mean that and it's still.

833
01:37:12.04 --> 01:37:29.04
I mean I was there working for an NGO and there were certain areas and certain things that they wanted covered and I had the opportunity on a couple of days to basically just go unilateral and just take a fixer and just go and do my own stuff and.

834
01:37:29.04 --> 01:37:40.04
On that particular trip that's when I actually shot the pictures that I thought were really quite interesting from that but that was that was looking at.

835
01:37:40.04 --> 01:37:52.04
Sort of Liberia as a whole but I was only in Montrovia but I had this picture of I mean we travel down to the River G County and I ran together.

836
01:37:52.04 --> 01:38:02.04
I mean just stunningly stunningly beautiful parts of the country. I mean just ridiculously beautiful.

837
01:38:02.04 --> 01:38:19.04
And the sort of the difference between living in the country and maybe living in Montrovia was was was so tangible. I mean Montrovia was it's the infrastructure has just completely disappeared and.

838
01:38:19.04 --> 01:38:32.04
I don't remember the figures but I just remember being blown away by the fact that the town was built for say hypothetically a million.

839
01:38:32.04 --> 01:38:40.04
And there's something like five million living in it. I mean those figures aren't correct but it's that sort of scale that was just mind blowing.

840
01:38:40.04 --> 01:38:58.04
It was such a shame because it's such a it's such a beautiful country the Liberians are such beautiful people and yet you you had this overriding sense that are they ever going to escape this is this legacy.

841
01:38:58.04 --> 01:39:05.04
Is it going to stay with Liberia are they are they ever going to be able to pull themselves out there are such a poor country.

842
01:39:05.04 --> 01:39:18.04
And I remember looking at areas where money was being spent and I was asking myself why you spending money here why you making the roads outside the mayors office look.

843
01:39:18.04 --> 01:39:36.04
And I remember walking through that and I never once felt intimidated.

844
01:39:36.04 --> 01:39:50.04
I was just incredibly vibrant places but the conditions that the people were living in there version of normality was.

845
01:39:50.04 --> 01:39:57.04
I can really can tell that picture you just couldn't just shoot those images to tell that story properly.

846
01:39:57.04 --> 01:40:07.04
I think you know it's one of those rare times when I've had a camera in my hand I think I can't tell this story with with a camera. I don't know what I can tell it with but I can't tell it with a camera.

847
01:40:07.04 --> 01:40:11.04
It's because the conditions were so.

848
01:40:11.04 --> 01:40:16.04
Yeah so so dreadful and I mean the way Monroe here is.

849
01:40:16.04 --> 01:40:26.04
There's built it sort of slightly on a hill and and it rains a lot in Liberia and what happens is the rain falls off the concrete and when it rains.

850
01:40:26.04 --> 01:40:40.04
Excuse me it really rains and it creates just torrents and these torrents just drop off the roads of Monroe and they go down into the slums and they hit the slums before they hit the sea.

851
01:40:40.04 --> 01:40:54.04
And the slums are I mean the floods at certain times of the year and yet the people are at the expected they know it's going to happen.

852
01:40:54.04 --> 01:41:09.04
So I'm spending some time in West Point, slum with a young man and his family and he is a health advisor and he has two daughters and they both want to be doctors and he is

853
01:41:09.04 --> 01:41:20.04
describing the conditions that they're living in and what they have to go through every day and I mean you can especially be walking through.

854
01:41:20.04 --> 01:41:38.04
Monroe you can see the sanitary conditions and the laboratories it's just it's it's beyond belief it really is and you know there are there are the trains that go straight into the river and they're just corrugated latrines with a door and you just go in and.

855
01:41:38.04 --> 01:41:47.04
The sewage goes straight into the river and three feet away the kids are just playing around in that river the way our kids would play around in a swimming pool.

856
01:41:47.04 --> 01:42:00.04
No idea of what is going through their systems and and of course when you catch something like dysentery or typhoid or they're one of the biggest killers of kids in Africa.

857
01:42:00.04 --> 01:42:12.04
And and and you look at it and you think how this is such a vicious circle how they're ever going to come out of this how are they ever going to find a way to lift themselves up because it's such a poor country.

858
01:42:12.04 --> 01:42:27.04
But they sort of make do with the situation that they're in and then the slum floods and they say oh yeah it's going to flood and although we're with four feet off the ground and we've got steps coming up to our.

859
01:42:27.04 --> 01:42:31.04
You know it's going to flood and it's going to come in so we have to just put.

860
01:42:31.04 --> 01:42:39.04
We sleep on on little stilts you know but they're getting up in the morning and stepping into it and coming out and then you know they don't have one in the ages.

861
01:42:39.04 --> 01:42:59.04
They're way through it and this goes on for and he said that I was there in August and he said who you should be here in September.

862
01:42:59.04 --> 01:43:11.04
I was just going to explain what it was I was looking at and I wasn't shooting it for anyone.

863
01:43:11.04 --> 01:43:17.04
In mind I mean the NGO take all my images they have they have access to all my images that I shoot whether I'm shooting it for them or whether I've just gone off piece so to speak to shoot so they get absolutely everything.

864
01:43:17.04 --> 01:43:37.04
So I was going to go to the way to document what it was that you could see and I was really struggling until there was one moment when I was wandering through the slum the flooded slum and I was up to my knees and sewage as we were walking through.

865
01:43:37.04 --> 01:43:55.04
I was a little flash of pink in front of me and I saw this young girl sort of just go between two buildings and she was carrying a pink umbrella and I remember thinking there's another picture of this.

866
01:43:55.04 --> 01:44:11.04
I asked the young doctor who was accompanying me through the slum I said you know what's the deal and he said oh she's probably after church or something you know she's in her sandy best effectively with her perfect little shoes and her skirt and her pink umbrella.

867
01:44:11.04 --> 01:44:29.04
So I thought nothing of it carried on shots and more pictures and I thought actually I've got I've got quite a lot of stuff here none of it I was really thinking this is really strong you know and then on the way back to the car I saw the little flash of pink.

868
01:44:29.04 --> 01:44:43.04
Again in front of me and it disappeared and I thought wow well this time I'm not giving up so I just started to run through this you know and you can imagine if you're running through two foot of sewage well.

869
01:44:43.04 --> 01:45:01.04
It's not the greatest sight in the world and you're trying to stop your cameras from going in and you're trying to and there's a couple of times that I nearly went ahead first in but I was so desperate to try and take a picture of this and my image ahead was when when she comes back through that corridor and comes back into this main corridor that I'm in of water.

870
01:45:01.04 --> 01:45:21.04
I just shoot her from behind like a Mary Poppins type of picture and the contrast for me was this beautiful little girl in this situation in this with her pink umbrella in this horrendous slum situation and there she was and by the time she disappeared again.

871
01:45:21.04 --> 01:45:38.04
I just thought this is just really not my day and then she'd obviously heard me running and she sort of popped out again and just turned around and it was almost like a little bank of sand that she was standing on between two huts and.

872
01:45:38.04 --> 01:45:52.04
There was about a foot and half a water in front of her and she just turned around and looked at me as if yes what do you want and I just took one picture and click.

873
01:45:52.04 --> 01:46:00.04
And that was it and and the second I took the picture she just turned on a heels and just walked off and tip to her away there was me in the middle of this.

874
01:46:00.04 --> 01:46:15.04
You know so which but she was finding these delicate way around just like Mary Poppins with you know and I didn't read and so I thought okay I hope that sharp because I'm shooting on manual focus lenses and.

875
01:46:15.04 --> 01:46:18.04
You know when you got one shot at it.

876
01:46:18.04 --> 01:46:30.04
You just really hope that you got it sharp you know because I happen in that situation when I've had one shot before I'm not got it sharp and those images want me so.

877
01:46:30.04 --> 01:46:33.04
I got back to the hotel.

878
01:46:33.04 --> 01:46:43.04
The NGO was still working on their TV film that they were doing and I put in the laptops scanned up and I looked at it and I just thought well yeah that.

879
01:46:43.04 --> 01:46:50.04
I don't want to remember I don't want to remember as this place that has been.

880
01:46:50.04 --> 01:46:52.04
If it's a rated.

881
01:46:52.04 --> 01:46:59.04
I want to remember it for the beauty that it has within it's you know.

882
01:46:59.04 --> 01:47:08.04
The human the beauty of the humanity there that's what I wanted to show because I don't want to come away from places and shoot images of people at their expense.

883
01:47:08.04 --> 01:47:21.04
I'm not just not me I'm I think the human race is a majestic species and if I'm out there and I want to shoot this I want to show it because it's there it's everywhere and you just have to see it you just see it and you go.

884
01:47:21.04 --> 01:47:29.04
That's what a human should look like and and even in the worst the worst conditions imaginable.

885
01:47:29.04 --> 01:47:37.04
It's there and that picture was it for me from Liberia and that's you know I have pictures from Liberia that I keep but that's the one.

886
01:47:37.04 --> 01:47:58.04
But I'm really proud of because it was sharp thank god but it just her beauty in that mess was what I wanted to remember and it just shows you if it there you look for it it's everywhere you just have to you have to want to find it it's easy to just go in there and shoot.

887
01:47:58.04 --> 01:48:06.04
What's obvious you know it's like sometimes you're going to sit for sure it's like shooting fish in a barrel it's there pointy camera shoot but you just got a.

888
01:48:06.04 --> 01:48:12.04
You just got up you know if you're looking for it you'll find it you know.

889
01:48:12.04 --> 01:48:19.04
Keep your eyes peeled yeah and you from there.

890
01:48:19.04 --> 01:48:32.04
You ended up also going to South Sudan and again just just a place of complete evil and darkness.

891
01:48:32.04 --> 01:48:38.04
For those either don't know anything about Sudan pulled a little clip.

892
01:48:38.04 --> 01:48:45.04
From the independent a guy named this is 2014 seal bond fenton wrote this.

893
01:48:45.04 --> 01:48:50.04
More than a hundred children have been killed in South Sudan.

894
01:48:50.04 --> 01:48:54.04
Whilst many others have been raped and castrated.

895
01:48:54.04 --> 01:49:01.04
According to UNICEF UNICEF says that a hundred and twenty nine children have been murdered in the last three weeks alone while surviving boys were castrated and girls were.

896
01:49:01.04 --> 01:49:11.04
They say that some children were even thrown into burning buildings.

897
01:49:11.04 --> 01:49:21.04
The executive director of UNICEF Anthony Lake said the violence against children in South Sudan has reached a new level of brutality.

898
01:49:21.04 --> 01:49:30.04
The details of the worsening violence against children are unspeakable but we must speak of them.

899
01:49:30.04 --> 01:49:39.04
Survivors report that boys have been castrated and left to bleed the death girls as young as eight have been gang raped and murdered.

900
01:49:39.04 --> 01:49:44.04
Children have been tied together before their attackers slit their throats.

901
01:49:44.04 --> 01:49:56.04
Others have been thrown into burning buildings.

902
01:49:56.04 --> 01:50:01.04
Just a nightmare scenario.

903
01:50:01.04 --> 01:50:05.04
And you and you're going to clarify one thing you're working for an NGO.

904
01:50:05.04 --> 01:50:07.04
Those of you don't know what that is.

905
01:50:07.04 --> 01:50:10.04
It's a non government organization.

906
01:50:10.04 --> 01:50:17.04
Generally you're talking about some kind of a benevolent organization that is trying to do good in the world such as the red cross is a.

907
01:50:17.04 --> 01:50:19.04
This is probably the premier example.

908
01:50:19.04 --> 01:50:25.04
I know you weren't specifically working for the red cross but you were working for another benevolent organization.

909
01:50:25.04 --> 01:50:30.04
When they called you up and brought you down to.

910
01:50:30.04 --> 01:50:34.04
South Sudan and again you're not.

911
01:50:34.04 --> 01:50:36.04
For the most part.

912
01:50:36.04 --> 01:50:40.04
Going to the front lines and capturing the action of the war.

913
01:50:40.04 --> 01:50:44.04
What you're capturing is the results of the war.

914
01:50:44.04 --> 01:50:45.04
Sure.

915
01:50:45.04 --> 01:50:48.04
And what did you see when you got to.

916
01:50:48.04 --> 01:50:51.04
When you got to sit down.

917
01:50:51.04 --> 01:50:56.04
Well we flew into Juba.

918
01:50:56.04 --> 01:51:00.04
And what we were looking at were UN camps.

919
01:51:00.04 --> 01:51:09.04
So the situation in South Sudan was that the two tribes, the Dinka tribe and the Nure tribe were at war with each other.

920
01:51:09.04 --> 01:51:13.04
And there was a lot of fighting and killing going on.

921
01:51:13.04 --> 01:51:18.04
And what the UN was trying to do.

922
01:51:18.04 --> 01:51:25.04
Was segregate the tribes from each other in certain areas so that they just stopped killing each other.

923
01:51:25.04 --> 01:51:30.04
Because until the killing stopped then really they politically they were never going to come to.

924
01:51:30.04 --> 01:51:33.04
And you had the president and the vice president.

925
01:51:33.04 --> 01:51:38.04
One was a Dinka and one was a Nure and whatever was happening between them was being mirrored.

926
01:51:38.04 --> 01:51:40.04
You know on the street so to speak.

927
01:51:40.04 --> 01:51:43.04
So and there was never any trust between those two men.

928
01:51:43.04 --> 01:51:46.04
They have a lot of history and there was never too much trust.

929
01:51:46.04 --> 01:51:49.04
It was when they got their independence.

930
01:51:49.04 --> 01:51:52.04
I think Sudan was only three years.

931
01:51:52.04 --> 01:51:54.04
It had been independent for three years.

932
01:51:54.04 --> 01:52:03.04
So we were visiting camps that were you know had segregated the tribes.

933
01:52:03.04 --> 01:52:11.04
And Juba was probably the most aggressive camp in that.

934
01:52:11.04 --> 01:52:18.04
The only time we ever had any trouble was maybe if some couple of guys had got to hold us a mile.

935
01:52:18.04 --> 01:52:22.04
Got hold and they wanted to know who are you doing here.

936
01:52:22.04 --> 01:52:26.04
You know in this place why you here.

937
01:52:26.04 --> 01:52:28.04
Why are you taking that.

938
01:52:28.04 --> 01:52:32.04
And what you have to remember is these people don't want to be photographed in this situation.

939
01:52:32.04 --> 01:52:35.04
This is not a good situation for them.

940
01:52:35.04 --> 01:52:40.04
And it's very easy as a journalist to go into a situation.

941
01:52:40.04 --> 01:52:43.04
So I have to document this and I have to show what's going on.

942
01:52:43.04 --> 01:52:48.04
But you have to understand that the dignity of these people needs to be taken into consideration.

943
01:52:48.04 --> 01:52:50.04
And you know some people are fine.

944
01:52:50.04 --> 01:52:56.04
They're fine to let you photograph and they go yep well this is where I am at the moment.

945
01:52:56.04 --> 01:53:02.04
And so yeah I'm quite happy for you to photograph me and others quite plain the aren't.

946
01:53:02.04 --> 01:53:09.04
So apart from the sort of criteria that the the NGO was looking for.

947
01:53:09.04 --> 01:53:23.04
And the NGO was effectively providing water for these camps because and they worked out some sort of desalination process and they were able to produce water on a regular basis for the camps.

948
01:53:23.04 --> 01:53:37.04
But the situation in the camps was incredible they were just so overcrowded and again you know back to that sort of scenario of people being cramped on top of each other and then you know that's how disease is spread and you know so on.

949
01:53:37.04 --> 01:53:55.04
So we then I there were obviously certain parts of south Sudan that I wanted to travel to because I knew that the situation in it up in those parts of the country was it was even worse than you know.

950
01:53:55.04 --> 01:54:07.04
And the jubber was relatively stable compared to other parts of Sudan. There was a there was a place called Benty that I wanted to get to and there's a lot of oil up there and both trying to try to control the oil.

951
01:54:07.04 --> 01:54:19.04
That's what they need to get hold of and and as we were sort of I'd see listen let's go there and the NGO security would say you can't because there's fighting and we don't we're not allowing staff.

952
01:54:19.04 --> 01:54:28.04
And the only the only time aid is getting to these places is there is helicopter drops but no one's touching the ground and you know and and.

953
01:54:28.04 --> 01:54:35.04
The NGO are very hot on security.

954
01:54:35.04 --> 01:54:44.04
I mean it's ox fan the NGO is ox fan and they're incredibly professional organization and they're very hot on security.

955
01:54:44.04 --> 01:54:52.04
Anywhere you go if you go to any country working for ox fan the first thing you get is a security briefing and they tell you what the situation is.

956
01:54:52.04 --> 01:55:00.04
What you can't do where they advise that we don't go and these are the regulations and the stipulations that they make and you have to adhere to them because you're there.

957
01:55:00.04 --> 01:55:13.04
As a member of staff with even I'm a freelancer I can technically do what I like you have to really sort of bear in mind that you are out there working with ox fan staff and ox fan staff have traveled out from the UK with you.

958
01:55:13.04 --> 01:55:23.04
So you really can't just go off-piece and start doing what you like because you could put other people's lives in jeopardy.

959
01:55:23.04 --> 01:55:34.04
So everywhere we wanted to go I particularly wanted to go we couldn't and it was just always the case I wanted to go here no you can't go there but you can go here.

960
01:55:34.04 --> 01:55:54.04
So we ended up traveling to areas that weren't where the the security risk was pretty low and these were camps you in camps you in mission camps that were created to where the fighting was at its worst and they were trying to stop the tribes from killing each other.

961
01:55:54.04 --> 01:56:12.04
And one of the places we went to which I will never forget is a place called ball and we sort of flew in in a small plane and we got I think it was a helicopter and a small plane and fortunately we didn't have to drive.

962
01:56:12.04 --> 01:56:31.04
Because I've been on a few journeys through Africa you know maybe ten forty now as in a car where there's no road. So we were grateful to be able to fly in and you could always fly and we'd always get in that maybe a you and helicopter that was dropping something and we just get in there and fly up with them and we got to this place and.

963
01:56:31.04 --> 01:56:54.04
Oxfam were working there and they were providing water and they had this situation where where the camp was being run by the current the South Koreans and they were sort of the they were physically building the camp and they were in charge of at the time and they had created this space maybe the size of two British football pictures or maybe a couple of American football pictures similar sort of thing.

964
01:56:54.04 --> 01:57:03.04
And so for people to live on and in this you had South Sudanese they were the new a tribe living in here and.

965
01:57:03.04 --> 01:57:07.04
You had you had wealthy.

966
01:57:07.04 --> 01:57:17.04
You had middle class and you had very poor living alongside each other in the camp so there was a real mix of people in the camp and.

967
01:57:17.04 --> 01:57:27.04
Oxfam were providing water and there was a huge reservoir but it wasn't a reservoir it was just a huge pit of water that had gone stagnant.

968
01:57:27.04 --> 01:57:35.04
And every time it rained it was flood and flood into the camp so they were having to control that and keep making sure that never got flooded.

969
01:57:35.04 --> 01:57:45.04
And at the same time they were producing water with this filtration system and providing pumps that people could you know and then basically centre listen if you want to come to the pump and take water you got to learn how to clean your bucket.

970
01:57:45.04 --> 01:57:49.04
And so they would in installing discipline into them.

971
01:57:49.04 --> 01:57:53.04
So you know and support that absolutely.

972
01:57:53.04 --> 01:57:55.04
And so.

973
01:57:55.04 --> 01:57:59.04
But it wasn't as simple as us turning up with.

974
01:57:59.04 --> 01:58:06.04
I was able to film maker a journalist and myself that with three of us and it wasn't as simple as just marching into the camp and saying hey.

975
01:58:06.04 --> 01:58:11.04
We're oxfam and we're here to take some pictures and shoot some film.

976
01:58:11.04 --> 01:58:21.04
So oxfam were working there in a capacity so we had to go through the route of talking to the elder and the elder was a doctor who worked in Canada who'd come all the way back from Canada and he described his journey to me.

977
01:58:21.04 --> 01:58:29.04
Of how he got to ball in south Sudan from Canada and I thought it was bad enough me coming from London.

978
01:58:29.04 --> 01:58:36.04
He threw to get to south to see that it was just I think it took him 11 days of pure travel to get from.

979
01:58:36.04 --> 01:58:38.04
Yeah it was it was unbelievable.

980
01:58:38.04 --> 01:58:41.04
And he was complaining about that traffic on the floor.

981
01:58:41.04 --> 01:58:47.04
Yeah totally it was it was just it was humbling and he was there to rescue his mother and and get her safe.

982
01:58:47.04 --> 01:58:53.04
And this was a camp so we had to talk to him and he wanted to know a little bit about us and he said you're fine.

983
01:58:53.04 --> 01:58:55.04
You can come in when we don't let any journalists in here.

984
01:58:55.04 --> 01:59:02.04
The journalists just come here and they do their story and they leave at our expense and we don't have that but you.

985
01:59:02.04 --> 01:59:09.04
You guys can come in and so we had.

986
01:59:09.04 --> 01:59:12.04
The elder has granted these guys a cool.

987
01:59:12.04 --> 01:59:24.04
They're fine do you like so this was a camp that had been attacked by the dynkah tribe a month earlier and.

988
01:59:24.04 --> 01:59:34.04
You know to try and build your picture if you can imagine the two football pictures.

989
01:59:34.04 --> 01:59:43.04
You had the you and camp and then within the you and camp there was this other camp that they were living in and it had a perimeter around it was just barbed wire and a perimeter and it was about the size of two football.

990
01:59:43.04 --> 01:59:55.04
And they were wanting the Koreans were meant to be building another space because the latrine said collapse because of the rain and they you know it was just it was it was the conditions were were abomnable.

991
01:59:55.04 --> 02:00:05.04
But this perimeter was on the outside of this perimeter was dynkah land and the dynkah said come in and they had attacked one night they had just still on the.

992
02:00:05.04 --> 02:00:13.04
On the outside over the fence and with machine guns just shot away and they killed a hundred of the tribe.

993
02:00:13.04 --> 02:00:26.04
Women children kids I mean we were talking to kids were bullets were coming through I mean they just live in it's a it's literally a couple of bamboo poles and some just white material that's what these people were living in but if you went into these.

994
02:00:26.04 --> 02:00:44.04
And then you realize again the dignity that you know you have to be you just have to be so careful as you just don't wander around gunhoo just you know that these they're a very they these are very proud people and they're in this situation and what's more.

995
02:00:44.04 --> 02:00:56.04
They can't get out because if they try and leave this camp they'll just they'll just be shot dead.

996
02:00:56.04 --> 02:01:06.04
You know by the opposing tribe and it was like that throughout Sudan so it didn't it wasn't necessarily just one tribe being protected it was the dynkah in one camp it was neural and the other and they've been protecting us and they were.

997
02:01:06.04 --> 02:01:14.04
I remember you say no they're joking did you ever notice the.

998
02:01:14.04 --> 02:01:16.04
The state of their lives or their fear ever being etched on their faces.

999
02:01:16.04 --> 02:01:20.04
Wherever you've traveled and if this was one place that I saw it.

1000
02:01:20.04 --> 02:01:25.04
It was in this camp and they were petrified that this was going to happen again.

1001
02:01:25.04 --> 02:01:35.04
Because the the UN hadn't reacted in time when the first attack happened and so they just thought this is just going to happen again and who's going to protect us.

1002
02:01:35.04 --> 02:01:50.04
So that is a again a situation where you're thinking when I leave this place I'm getting on my plane and I'm going to fly home and yet they are still going to be in that camp and they're still not going to be able to leave.

1003
02:01:50.04 --> 02:02:00.04
And in this camp you're talking to young guys that were professionals working in jubber and you know you're it's.

1004
02:02:00.04 --> 02:02:13.04
Yeah that was the closest I had as an experience to Sri Lanka was sounds it done and you brought that attitude.

1005
02:02:13.04 --> 02:02:27.04
And you're next as you. Yeah your next assignment that you shot oddly enough for something that you had scheduled. Six months prior you said you know what. I'm going to go and just take a breather.

1006
02:02:27.04 --> 02:02:32.04
I'm going to go and shoot Wimbleton the tennis tournament in England on grass courts.

1007
02:02:32.04 --> 02:02:40.04
You'd scheduled that and the meantime you you go to Sudan you experience this when you get home and this was just on your own you just schedule it for yourself to show you.

1008
02:02:40.04 --> 02:02:49.04
Yeah, non-commission and you brought this back with you and what what did that do to your your Wimbleton shoot.

1009
02:02:49.04 --> 02:03:08.04
Well originally I I think it was a couple of weeks before Wimbleton started and I was not in the slightest bit interested in going to shoot the story and I'd go on to all this trouble to get this accreditation and the.

1010
02:03:08.04 --> 02:03:12.04
The the photographer that runs.

1011
02:03:12.04 --> 02:03:22.04
The Wimbleton is also very very highly respected sports photographer who also runs the photographer with the Olympics and he'd said, Karen listen.

1012
02:03:22.04 --> 02:03:27.04
I'd be happy for you to come in and shoot whatever it is you want to shoot.

1013
02:03:27.04 --> 02:03:37.04
And I'd gone to all that trouble to get that and he'd given it his blessing and I thought, you know what I'm just going to turn and I said, Bob, I don't really don't fancy this because I've just been in South Sudan living with with with these people in these camps.

1014
02:03:37.04 --> 02:03:43.04
And the idea of going to Wimbleton shooting people eating drinking champagne and eating strawberries and cream.

1015
02:03:43.04 --> 02:03:47.04
It really that's I'm just that's what echo and I like the call of love.

1016
02:03:47.04 --> 02:04:00.04
Yeah, yeah and on top of that it was a self commission so you know it's a freelancer self commissioning and not only any money it's not really the greatest idea in the world, but.

1017
02:04:00.04 --> 02:04:13.04
But but over time as we got closer, I just thought, I, you know, what, hey, why yeah, okay, maybe I'll go and do this. So I went for the first couple of days and.

1018
02:04:13.04 --> 02:04:15.04
I just.

1019
02:04:15.04 --> 02:04:16.04
I had an idea.

1020
02:04:16.04 --> 02:04:26.04
I wanted to see if Wimbleton still had any charm because I went with my dad when I was 10 years old and I never forgot it. I got to see John McEnroe and Peter Peter Fleming.

1021
02:04:26.04 --> 02:04:30.04
Yeah, Peter Fleming not even Fleming play doubles.

1022
02:04:30.04 --> 02:04:34.04
I bumped into John Lloyd a British tennis player at the time.

1023
02:04:34.04 --> 02:04:42.04
Just and I just remember thinking that was a magical afternoon. I had with my dad for my birthday when I was 10 years old.

1024
02:04:42.04 --> 02:04:46.04
Let's see if Wimbleton still has that magic.

1025
02:04:46.04 --> 02:04:56.04
I had bearing in mind that I had shot 15 Wimbleton's previously in my career as a professional sitting on court shooting the tennis.

1026
02:04:56.04 --> 02:04:58.04
You know, I was there when Venus when I first.

1027
02:04:58.04 --> 02:05:04.04
I was there when Roger Federer beat Sampress, you know, the seminal moments and sport.

1028
02:05:04.04 --> 02:05:11.04
So I just wanted to see if I had any charm. Now that was my original intention when I got the press graduation six months only.

1029
02:05:11.04 --> 02:05:17.04
That completely went out the window. I wasn't interested in one of them. I don't need charm or not.

1030
02:05:17.04 --> 02:05:24.04
I just thought I'm going to go up and I'm going to photograph those people that can't just get.

1031
02:05:24.04 --> 02:05:28.04
You can get the cheapest ticket and get in and just wander around the outside courts.

1032
02:05:28.04 --> 02:05:30.04
I don't want to see a tennis player.

1033
02:05:30.04 --> 02:05:32.04
I don't want to go anywhere near the show courts.

1034
02:05:32.04 --> 02:05:38.04
I just want to see what it's like to be a punter because when I came up when I was 10 years old, that's what I was with my dad.

1035
02:05:38.04 --> 02:05:46.04
We were just two punters that managed to sneak two tickets to get into show court to see McEnroe and Fleming play doubles.

1036
02:05:46.04 --> 02:05:51.04
So in a way, I was, well, I maybe trying to see if I did have a bit of charm.

1037
02:05:51.04 --> 02:05:56.04
I think so, but I had really gone out of my head. So I turned up and I just started walking around.

1038
02:05:56.04 --> 02:06:01.04
And the my attitude was, what you know what?

1039
02:06:01.04 --> 02:06:05.04
It doesn't matter if I don't get a picture because who's going to shout at me?

1040
02:06:05.04 --> 02:06:10.04
Who's going to say, Cure, what have you got today? No one, only me.

1041
02:06:10.04 --> 02:06:15.04
So I just, my mind's changed dramatically and I just started wanting around.

1042
02:06:15.04 --> 02:06:18.04
I remember I used to hang around in the, I had a press conference.

1043
02:06:18.04 --> 02:06:24.04
I just went to the media hall with where my, all my mates were working.

1044
02:06:24.04 --> 02:06:29.04
You know, slogging they got out covering the tennis because it sounds really glamorous.

1045
02:06:29.04 --> 02:06:35.04
But it's, it's full on shooting tennis at one point. It really is full on.

1046
02:06:35.04 --> 02:06:40.04
And they just, you say, hang around in the calf a lot.

1047
02:06:40.04 --> 02:06:45.04
I said, yeah, I know because I'm just waiting for the light and I just can't see what the rear is.

1048
02:06:45.04 --> 02:06:49.04
You know, and then I got out of, I've got to go and sit on center court for another four hours.

1049
02:06:49.04 --> 02:06:52.04
And then Andy Murray's going to come on a plane. The roof's going to come over.

1050
02:06:52.04 --> 02:06:54.04
And I'm not going to go out of here till 10 o'clock.

1051
02:06:54.04 --> 02:06:59.04
And I really, yeah, I'll be gone by six, you know, because the light will have gone then.

1052
02:06:59.04 --> 02:07:03.04
And there'll be no need for me to be here. And I'd have another cup of coffee and wander out and just wander around.

1053
02:07:03.04 --> 02:07:09.04
And I just had one camera and one lens, just a small like a 35 mil.

1054
02:07:09.04 --> 02:07:13.04
And I'd wander and wander and wander and first couple of days.

1055
02:07:13.04 --> 02:07:15.04
Didn't get anything.

1056
02:07:15.04 --> 02:07:16.04
Okay.

1057
02:07:16.04 --> 02:07:19.04
So I decided, okay, let's go on day three and I went on day three.

1058
02:07:19.04 --> 02:07:22.04
And I remember walking around and what had happened at this window is that,

1059
02:07:22.04 --> 02:07:24.04
the window is the occasion they build a new court.

1060
02:07:24.04 --> 02:07:30.04
And when they build a new court, it means the dynamics of that area since last year have changed.

1061
02:07:30.04 --> 02:07:35.04
So walls have gone up and in the wind, they're not walls.

1062
02:07:35.04 --> 02:07:41.04
They put sort of green sheeting, very thick heavy sheeting across to sort of delineate.

1063
02:07:41.04 --> 02:07:42.04
This is a new court.

1064
02:07:42.04 --> 02:07:49.04
Well, what that means is that the security guards who are employed, who are just young guys looking for a summer job,

1065
02:07:49.04 --> 02:07:53.04
you know, they're employed. They haven't got a clue what the dynamics are of this court,

1066
02:07:53.04 --> 02:07:57.04
because this is the court only existed this year and all these new things have been put in place.

1067
02:07:57.04 --> 02:08:09.04
And so I remember just coming around the corner and I saw this guy standing with his face right up to the green base like this.

1068
02:08:09.04 --> 02:08:13.04
And I thought, it's as if he'd been sent to the naughty step.

1069
02:08:13.04 --> 02:08:16.04
Oh, what is it? You know, face the walls on.

1070
02:08:16.04 --> 02:08:18.04
I thought what is going on here.

1071
02:08:18.04 --> 02:08:22.04
So I've sort of watching and I took a few pictures and I thought, okay, I need to get another bit closer here.

1072
02:08:22.04 --> 02:08:29.04
And as I did that, somebody else walked past me and just went straight up to the wall and put there like this.

1073
02:08:29.04 --> 02:08:40.04
And I thought, God, there must be a pinpricks in the material that allows them to put their eye right up to it and they can see the whole court.

1074
02:08:40.04 --> 02:08:44.04
And, you know, I thought that's what they're doing.

1075
02:08:44.04 --> 02:08:50.04
Okay, right, I get it now. So I thought, well, I need this for 10 people to just do this and I've got a picture.

1076
02:08:50.04 --> 02:08:58.04
So as I'm doing this, as I'm waiting for this moment to evolve thinking, I haven't got a picture yet,

1077
02:08:58.04 --> 02:09:06.04
I've been able to, and this could be my first. So I'm going to, I'm going to let this one mature and see what happens.

1078
02:09:06.04 --> 02:09:18.04
And as I did that, this guy turns up, young guy turns up with a prime and he takes his kid out of the prime and his kid has this shock of red hair and he's maybe eight months old.

1079
02:09:18.04 --> 02:09:24.04
No, maybe a year old, a bit older than that, yeah, but a year old, still a really tiny baby.

1080
02:09:24.04 --> 02:09:30.04
And his wife walks past and his wife goes to join the three other people appearing through like this.

1081
02:09:30.04 --> 02:09:36.04
And I thought, okay, right, God, listen, there's four people there and this and then I don't know what this guy's doing with this baby.

1082
02:09:36.04 --> 02:09:42.04
I mean, you know, but this baby's got such an amazing shock of red hair. It looked fantastic against the green.

1083
02:09:42.04 --> 02:09:51.04
So I've got it, this, what's going to happen and this guy just picked the baby up and shoved the baby's head over the top of the base.

1084
02:09:51.04 --> 02:09:56.04
And before I took a picture, I thought, why are you doing that?

1085
02:09:56.04 --> 02:10:08.04
Because the baby can't see anything. And you certainly, and I think in his mind, he thought, if I shove the baby's head over the top, I'll be able to see something as if it was like a periscope.

1086
02:10:08.04 --> 02:10:13.04
And it was so bizarre and he kept it there and I thought, right, it's time to take a picture.

1087
02:10:13.04 --> 02:10:19.04
So I took this picture and as I took the picture, there was an old boy standing behind me, selling programs and he went,

1088
02:10:19.04 --> 02:10:27.04
hmm, that's a hell of a picture you've got there and I thought, yeah, it is, and let's, I'm just going to see if something else happens with the baby.

1089
02:10:27.04 --> 02:10:37.04
You know, I don't know what's going on, but it didn't. And I had my picture, but what I really wanted was to have been on the other side of that court and just seen that baby's head.

1090
02:10:37.04 --> 02:10:40.04
I'm pretty at over the top. So that was my first picture.

1091
02:10:40.04 --> 02:10:50.04
And I thought, okay, this has, and that's how I normally work, get one on the belt and build on it and I thought, that's a very funny picture.

1092
02:10:50.04 --> 02:11:03.04
That is how I am going to look at this story. I'm going to find the humorous elements of being a punter in Wimbledon and I want to shoot it as if you,

1093
02:11:03.04 --> 02:11:12.04
you, so when you look at the pictures, you think, why has he shot that picture with those two heads in the way?

1094
02:11:12.04 --> 02:11:19.04
And I can only just see that tennis player. And my point is, well, if you're a punter at Wimbledon, that's exactly how you see it.

1095
02:11:19.04 --> 02:11:22.04
You don't cheat seats, you don't have a punter at all.

1096
02:11:22.04 --> 02:11:30.04
Yeah, absolutely. So, and most of these seats, so you just walk around and stand. So you're always crouching and trying to see.

1097
02:11:30.04 --> 02:11:36.04
And I just thought, and of course, I, I have very rarely looked through the camera. I'd see a situation and just go, there you go.

1098
02:11:36.04 --> 02:11:41.04
Because I didn't care. I actually didn't care whether I got anything that was any good.

1099
02:11:41.04 --> 02:11:48.04
I just thought, you know, this is a nice feeling to just wander around and just click away.

1100
02:11:48.04 --> 02:11:54.04
And I wasn't framing anything. I was framing, but framing in a way for a purpose, but I didn't care.

1101
02:11:54.04 --> 02:12:00.04
And if somebody said to me, is that the result of two weeks at Wimbledon, I would have said, yeah, you know, I don't care.

1102
02:12:00.04 --> 02:12:08.04
And I, I really, really don't care. So that was, that was the attitude with which I shot it.

1103
02:12:08.04 --> 02:12:21.04
And yeah, so to finish the story, so come, that was June 2014.

1104
02:12:21.04 --> 02:12:25.04
And come January 2015, are the big.

1105
02:12:25.04 --> 02:12:32.04
In the world of photojournalists and the world press photo awards. And I, the world, those are like the, the Oscars.

1106
02:12:32.04 --> 02:12:43.04
Yeah, for photojournalists and yeah, they're the big ones. And I remember when I was a young kid, I always used to print my stuff up, you know, when I was starting and send it in and then look at the stuff and go, why didn't I win anything?

1107
02:12:43.04 --> 02:12:48.04
Well, that's because, you know, my stuff was just crap. And that's why I didn't win anything.

1108
02:12:48.04 --> 02:12:55.04
So I sort of stopped entering competitions when I resigned from Reuters in 2008. It just didn't really interest me anymore.

1109
02:12:55.04 --> 02:13:03.04
But I found a mind-wring me up and he said, you have entered those London pictures into WordPress for it. I said, no.

1110
02:13:03.04 --> 02:13:12.04
And he said, I'll kill you and you've got to do their amazing pictures. You and I thought, were you the only one that thinks that they're amazing pictures? I was happy with them.

1111
02:13:12.04 --> 02:13:23.04
But, you know, and he said, no, no, no, do it. So I did, and I had to submit 10 pictures. And I found 14 images that were potential and I got down to seven.

1112
02:13:23.04 --> 02:13:34.04
And then I called Teary and I said, to Teary, listen, you got to find another three pictures out of this, these five or six, which three do you think should go into the set and and Teary said that one, that one and that one.

1113
02:13:34.04 --> 02:13:40.04
Is it great? Was it an in it went? And the long behold, it won.

1114
02:13:40.04 --> 02:13:54.04
So yeah. And the irony of the story was self-commission yourself and I know money and you went a big award.

1115
02:13:54.04 --> 02:14:03.04
I want to cover one more thing before you wrap this up and one more series of images that you took and I'm going to start this off with a poem.

1116
02:14:03.04 --> 02:14:09.04
The poem is called Repatriation. Then I'm just going to do an excerpt from it.

1117
02:14:09.04 --> 02:14:22.04
The coffin draped in Union Jack is slowly carried out the back out of the dark and into the light, slowly down the ramp and to the right.

1118
02:14:22.04 --> 02:14:28.04
The six approached the hers all black and placed the hero gently in the back.

1119
02:14:28.04 --> 02:14:32.04
The six then turned and march away.

1120
02:14:32.04 --> 02:14:36.04
Their duty has been done this day.

1121
02:14:36.04 --> 02:14:44.04
Politicians usually have much to say, no sign of them near here this day.

1122
02:14:44.04 --> 02:14:47.04
They hide away and out of danger.

1123
02:14:47.04 --> 02:14:52.04
Much easier if the hero is a stranger.

1124
02:14:52.04 --> 02:14:58.04
The hers with its precious load move slowly out onto the road.

1125
02:14:58.04 --> 02:15:07.04
The floral tributes line the route while comrades snap a smart salute.

1126
02:15:07.04 --> 02:15:13.04
At the edge of a wheelchair town, the courted slows its pace right down.

1127
02:15:13.04 --> 02:15:21.04
The streets are packed many deep, some throw flowers, most just weep.

1128
02:15:21.04 --> 02:15:29.04
The crowd have come to say farewell. The church bell rings a low death now.

1129
02:15:29.04 --> 02:15:36.04
Regimental standards are lower down as the hero passed through the town.

1130
02:15:36.04 --> 02:15:41.04
The courted stops and silence rains.

1131
02:15:41.04 --> 02:15:45.04
The towns folk feel the families pain.

1132
02:15:45.04 --> 02:15:57.04
The nation's flag lowered to half-master. Our brave hero is home at last.

1133
02:15:57.04 --> 02:16:10.04
That was written by Sergeant Andrew McFarlane in 2009 about a place in England called Wudenbassett,

1134
02:16:10.04 --> 02:16:22.04
which is where all British soldiers and service members that were killed in action were brought back home to England.

1135
02:16:22.04 --> 02:16:28.04
And you shot some amazing photographs of that.

1136
02:16:28.04 --> 02:16:39.04
And this was actually when I first got to know you, this was the first thing I found out was that you shot these photos.

1137
02:16:39.04 --> 02:17:04.04
And they're just incredible and they represent really to me just an incredible view of England and what England is in the world.

1138
02:17:04.04 --> 02:17:14.04
And how did you end up there once again with your camera in your hand?

1139
02:17:14.04 --> 02:17:21.04
I was assigned the first time I ever went to Wudenbassett, it was an assignment.

1140
02:17:21.04 --> 02:17:31.04
And I turned up and I was told the only information I was given was bring a really tall ladder because you'll need it.

1141
02:17:31.04 --> 02:17:37.04
And I didn't understand the dynamics of what was happening on the street.

1142
02:17:37.04 --> 02:17:47.04
So it was my first time and I got there and the traffic was awful and I literally arrived maybe 20 minutes before the the Quotege came through.

1143
02:17:47.04 --> 02:17:51.04
So I was running down the street with my ladder trying to, and I thought, okay, here were the other photographers.

1144
02:17:51.04 --> 02:17:57.04
So we would do a ladder up here and the ladder became clear because you need to go to the top of the ladder.

1145
02:17:57.04 --> 02:18:12.04
So when the herses come down the street and stop and the family members put their roses on the hers, you need to be able to see over the top of the hers to be able to see the grieving widow's and relatives.

1146
02:18:12.04 --> 02:18:22.04
And you know you're standing on top of a six step ladder, you know, you're probably about 15 or 16 feet in the air and you're really quite conspicuous with the long lens.

1147
02:18:22.04 --> 02:18:33.04
And it wasn't something that I was really comfortable doing because the click of a camera in that silence was deafening.

1148
02:18:33.04 --> 02:18:44.04
And it was one of those things that wouldn't, the repatriations had been happening before for a while I think before I got there.

1149
02:18:44.04 --> 02:18:52.04
And I mean years maybe 2008, 2007, but before I, you know, had actually turned up to shoot my first one.

1150
02:18:52.04 --> 02:18:55.04
So there had been a pattern that had developed over time.

1151
02:18:55.04 --> 02:19:02.04
And the pattern was, I was done up, they stand up a ladder, they shoot the pictures, the event finishes, and everybody goes home and the pictures are wired.

1152
02:19:02.04 --> 02:19:09.04
And my first time I was there, I ended up the best image I shot was from the floor of a young girl holding red roses,

1153
02:19:09.04 --> 02:19:22.04
looking down the street waiting for the, the court aged to pass. And I was really aware of the ladders and the noise of the cameras and I thought I can't, I stopped myself from shooting because it was so loud.

1154
02:19:22.04 --> 02:19:25.04
And I thought I can't be the one and you would see something happening.

1155
02:19:25.04 --> 02:19:38.04
And you would see a moment when maybe a wife came out and she touched the back of the hers with her hand, you know, and put her head against the glass and you, you're instinct, instinct is to shoot that and shoot as many friends.

1156
02:19:38.04 --> 02:19:39.04
That is possible.

1157
02:19:39.04 --> 02:19:44.04
But I had my camera on single shot, so I was click, click, click, click, click, or you could hear it.

1158
02:19:44.04 --> 02:19:49.04
It was like machine guns of cameras and it was, and it was so invasive.

1159
02:19:49.04 --> 02:19:52.04
And I thought, but this is, this is how the photographer has got their pictures.

1160
02:19:52.04 --> 02:19:55.04
This is what they had to do. There was no way round it.

1161
02:19:55.04 --> 02:20:01.04
And I decided, that's fine. I understand that, that's what, that's what we have to do to get the pictures.

1162
02:20:01.04 --> 02:20:06.04
But I'm not going to do that anymore. I don't, I don't really want to get involved in this anymore.

1163
02:20:06.04 --> 02:20:11.04
I found it too stressful. And what I ended up doing was not shooting when I should have shot,

1164
02:20:11.04 --> 02:20:17.04
stopping myself because I didn't want my click to be the click that everybody heard.

1165
02:20:17.04 --> 02:20:21.04
And even though everybody had accepted that this is what happens.

1166
02:20:21.04 --> 02:20:23.04
I thought, well, I'm just not comfortable with this.

1167
02:20:23.04 --> 02:20:26.04
So I decided then that this was an amazing event.

1168
02:20:26.04 --> 02:20:33.04
And that I needed to look at this properly and bearing in mind that I had been late for relatively.

1169
02:20:33.04 --> 02:20:38.04
I hadn't seen what had happened before the process came.

1170
02:20:38.04 --> 02:20:44.04
I had no idea what happened. So the next time I went down, I got down there really early.

1171
02:20:44.04 --> 02:20:47.04
And I, there was no one on the street and I watched the build up.

1172
02:20:47.04 --> 02:20:53.04
And for those of that don't know that what the whole story about Wooden Bass, it was,

1173
02:20:53.04 --> 02:21:02.04
the bodies of service personnel killed in action in Afghanistan were being repatriated to

1174
02:21:02.04 --> 02:21:08.04
an air base and the only route out of the air base was through this tiny village market town.

1175
02:21:08.04 --> 02:21:10.04
Called Wooden Bass.

1176
02:21:10.04 --> 02:21:11.04
Called Wooden Bass.

1177
02:21:11.04 --> 02:21:15.04
As the bodies were taken to the coroner's office in Oxford.

1178
02:21:15.04 --> 02:21:17.04
And it was the first time this happened.

1179
02:21:17.04 --> 02:21:22.04
The the herses came through and then I think the town may have spotted it.

1180
02:21:22.04 --> 02:21:26.04
And he just stopped and doffed his cap as they went past.

1181
02:21:26.04 --> 02:21:34.04
And then that just exponentially grew into you'd have thousands on the street over the years.

1182
02:21:34.04 --> 02:21:37.04
It just grew into thousands and then the families changed their routine.

1183
02:21:37.04 --> 02:21:43.04
The families would just go to the the basin, line them and pay their final respects.

1184
02:21:43.04 --> 02:21:44.04
And then they would leave.

1185
02:21:44.04 --> 02:21:47.04
But what happened was that the families would then pay their final respects.

1186
02:21:47.04 --> 02:21:52.04
And then everybody would wait for the families to come to the street and stand on the street.

1187
02:21:52.04 --> 02:21:59.04
And so that you could see how the whole thing was evolving into this sort of incredible ten minutes.

1188
02:21:59.04 --> 02:22:05.04
And it started with people were turned up on the street and you'd find people that hadn't seen each other for years.

1189
02:22:05.04 --> 02:22:07.04
And they were just,

1190
02:22:07.04 --> 02:22:09.04
Hey, how's it going?

1191
02:22:09.04 --> 02:22:13.04
You fancy going to the pub for a pint and they'd go and they'd have a drink and there would be this.

1192
02:22:13.04 --> 02:22:15.04
It was almost like a party atmosphere.

1193
02:22:15.04 --> 02:22:17.04
People were really pleased to see each other.

1194
02:22:17.04 --> 02:22:23.04
And there was this lively, bubbly noise going on and people were laughing and joking.

1195
02:22:23.04 --> 02:22:30.04
Then the families would turn up and everything would sort of calm down.

1196
02:22:30.04 --> 02:22:34.04
Just a little bit and then the bells would toll on the church.

1197
02:22:34.04 --> 02:22:37.04
And there was complete silence.

1198
02:22:37.04 --> 02:22:44.04
And then the courtesial would come through and it would stop and it would be led by a lead sort of poor bear and it would stop.

1199
02:22:44.04 --> 02:22:49.04
And it would give five minutes with the families and then sometimes it was just one house.

1200
02:22:49.04 --> 02:22:55.04
Sometimes it was, I did one occasion there was six, six houses that came in.

1201
02:22:55.04 --> 02:23:01.04
And then it would leave and then everybody would disperse and then it would happen again.

1202
02:23:01.04 --> 02:23:03.04
And then again and it would be, it could be twice a week.

1203
02:23:03.04 --> 02:23:05.04
It might be once a month.

1204
02:23:05.04 --> 02:23:11.04
But I'd said every time it happens, I'm going to go down and shoot the story in a linear fashion.

1205
02:23:11.04 --> 02:23:14.04
Because I just wanted to show everything from start to finish.

1206
02:23:14.04 --> 02:23:19.04
So when you look at the essay of 50 pictures, it starts at the beginning with the street empty.

1207
02:23:19.04 --> 02:23:24.04
And then it works up to the last thing you see on the street of the roses.

1208
02:23:24.04 --> 02:23:29.04
As the horses have driven off and the roses have fallen off the horses.

1209
02:23:29.04 --> 02:23:33.04
But I couldn't do it as a press photographer would do it.

1210
02:23:33.04 --> 02:23:35.04
I had to find a way of doing it.

1211
02:23:35.04 --> 02:23:38.04
And because I just wanted to get those moments.

1212
02:23:38.04 --> 02:23:43.04
I was looking for something completely different to what maybe the newspapers and the wire agencies were looking for.

1213
02:23:43.04 --> 02:23:45.04
So I decided to shoot on film.

1214
02:23:45.04 --> 02:23:50.04
And I have two like at M6s and I had a 28 mil and a 50 mil and I put film in.

1215
02:23:50.04 --> 02:23:53.04
Because I could operate and you just can't hear those cameras.

1216
02:23:53.04 --> 02:23:56.04
It's just a.

1217
02:23:56.04 --> 02:24:00.04
As opposed to the digital which was really loud.

1218
02:24:00.04 --> 02:24:02.04
And I started shooting it on film.

1219
02:24:02.04 --> 02:24:04.04
And it was really hit and miss.

1220
02:24:04.04 --> 02:24:05.04
I'd get stuff.

1221
02:24:05.04 --> 02:24:08.04
And I go down there on some occasions.

1222
02:24:08.04 --> 02:24:10.04
And I'd get nothing.

1223
02:24:10.04 --> 02:24:14.04
But every time I went down as I was building the story,

1224
02:24:14.04 --> 02:24:19.04
I knew, okay, I'll look at the situation and work out what I'm going to get from this today and concentrate.

1225
02:24:19.04 --> 02:24:22.04
On one thing and invariably you would concentrate on one thing.

1226
02:24:22.04 --> 02:24:26.04
But what you would get was something that would happen somewhere else.

1227
02:24:26.04 --> 02:24:33.04
And so it meant getting into positions that the press were not supposed to be getting into.

1228
02:24:33.04 --> 02:24:37.04
So I would want to go on to the other side of the street which was reserved for family.

1229
02:24:37.04 --> 02:24:38.04
I mean anyone could stand there.

1230
02:24:38.04 --> 02:24:41.04
But the under it and all was this is for family.

1231
02:24:41.04 --> 02:24:44.04
And I didn't want to intrude on the family.

1232
02:24:44.04 --> 02:24:49.04
And they're grief and I wasn't there to photograph their grief from my position.

1233
02:24:49.04 --> 02:24:50.04
Up close.

1234
02:24:50.04 --> 02:24:57.04
I just wanted to see the reaction of people around there that I couldn't see from the other side of the road.

1235
02:24:57.04 --> 02:24:59.04
So I was taking pictures.

1236
02:24:59.04 --> 02:25:00.04
And I felt so conspicuous.

1237
02:25:00.04 --> 02:25:04.04
And I was there with these two tiny cameras, but I felt so conspicuous.

1238
02:25:04.04 --> 02:25:05.04
But no one was looking at me.

1239
02:25:05.04 --> 02:25:09.04
And I was able to just turn the camera around and just pre-focus and shoot.

1240
02:25:09.04 --> 02:25:12.04
I don't put it to my eye, just turn around, click, shoot.

1241
02:25:12.04 --> 02:25:15.04
So everything was sort of one frame.

1242
02:25:15.04 --> 02:25:21.04
And yeah, I sort of gradually sort of built the story up.

1243
02:25:21.04 --> 02:25:25.04
And I knew that I had an ending because it.

1244
02:25:25.04 --> 02:25:32.04
The air base that they were coming into originally before it came to Wooden Basset had been rebuilt.

1245
02:25:32.04 --> 02:25:36.04
And all the bodies were going to be repatriated back to other air base.

1246
02:25:36.04 --> 02:25:43.04
So I knew at some point in August 2011 there would be the last repatriation.

1247
02:25:43.04 --> 02:25:52.04
So the fight you have with yourself when you're looking at the story and you're sitting there thinking,

1248
02:25:52.04 --> 02:25:56.04
I think I need an image here to fill this gap.

1249
02:25:56.04 --> 02:26:05.04
Is that you're waiting for a soldier to die in order for you to finish your story.

1250
02:26:05.04 --> 02:26:10.04
And it's not that you're waiting for a soldier to die, but a soldier dies.

1251
02:26:10.04 --> 02:26:14.04
And you, or in order for you to finish it yet, that there's not.

1252
02:26:14.04 --> 02:26:19.04
I'm not even articulate enough to explain what I mean by that.

1253
02:26:19.04 --> 02:26:24.04
But the idea that you're here on the news, two soldiers have been killed.

1254
02:26:24.04 --> 02:26:29.04
And you think, okay, that's me going back down to Wooden Basset to finish this story.

1255
02:26:29.04 --> 02:26:39.04
So the idea that I had a purpose of going down to a place like that was really hard to deal with because people,

1256
02:26:39.04 --> 02:26:46.04
everyone else down there was there because they were involved in, or directly involved with the soldier,

1257
02:26:46.04 --> 02:26:50.04
or they were people that just went to pay their respects.

1258
02:26:50.04 --> 02:26:56.04
And so you could say in a way, if you wanted to justify to myself, you are paying your respects in a way,

1259
02:26:56.04 --> 02:27:02.04
because I wanted to, I wanted this story to be shot from start to finish because I think it deserved that.

1260
02:27:02.04 --> 02:27:10.04
It wasn't just about grieving family members on the other side of a hers, you know, weeping.

1261
02:27:10.04 --> 02:27:12.04
It was so much more to that story than that.

1262
02:27:12.04 --> 02:27:16.04
And so gradually the story began to sort of fill itself out.

1263
02:27:16.04 --> 02:27:22.04
And then in the end, I was there for the final repatriation.

1264
02:27:22.04 --> 02:27:30.04
And the town was then awarded Royal status, which is the first time that happened.

1265
02:27:30.04 --> 02:27:32.04
I don't think I've ever heard of it 100 years.

1266
02:27:32.04 --> 02:27:39.04
Because it was the way I think that they were the town, the way that it conducted itself,

1267
02:27:39.04 --> 02:27:43.04
was recognized.

1268
02:27:43.04 --> 02:27:48.04
You know, by the Royal Family and they just sort of said, listen, what you've done,

1269
02:27:48.04 --> 02:27:55.04
you've not just put wooden basso on the map, but you've shown how much dignity the British show

1270
02:27:55.04 --> 02:28:00.04
when, you know, those that are fighting for their country are coming back and the way the whole thing.

1271
02:28:00.04 --> 02:28:06.04
And wooden basso, they didn't want the adulation, they didn't want to be known as this place.

1272
02:28:06.04 --> 02:28:10.04
They just thought that we need to do this.

1273
02:28:10.04 --> 02:28:17.04
And yep, it's from the heart, like we were saying earlier, there's no, there was no artillery motive from that town to do what they did.

1274
02:28:17.04 --> 02:28:19.04
It just happened. It was organic.

1275
02:28:19.04 --> 02:28:22.04
And I wanted to show that story.

1276
02:28:22.04 --> 02:28:28.04
And so yeah, that was it. It took, I think it was 19 months of going down.

1277
02:28:28.04 --> 02:28:35.04
And photographing it in every, you know, from every conceivable angle.

1278
02:28:35.04 --> 02:28:38.04
And I was really proud of the finished set of pictures.

1279
02:28:38.04 --> 02:28:46.04
I thought that tells the story from how I saw it, from start to finish.

1280
02:28:46.04 --> 02:28:56.04
And yeah, it was, and when it, when it finished, I didn't know how I felt because I thought, you know,

1281
02:28:56.04 --> 02:29:04.04
when you get so used to doing something and you know, I don't want soldiers to die so that I can go down and finish a story.

1282
02:29:04.04 --> 02:29:13.04
But you try and work out, how do I, how do I mentally get my head around what's happening here, you know?

1283
02:29:13.04 --> 02:29:21.04
But the thing that's come out of it is that on the final

1284
02:29:21.04 --> 02:29:27.04
Repatriation, I wanted the pictures to be exhibited.

1285
02:29:27.04 --> 02:29:32.04
Down there, I wanted to show wooden basket what I spent 18 months doing.

1286
02:29:32.04 --> 02:29:35.04
But I didn't want to stick print in a room.

1287
02:29:35.04 --> 02:29:41.04
And I didn't want, you know, I just thought these pictures, I, this is, I shot this on the street.

1288
02:29:41.04 --> 02:29:44.04
These pictures need to be on the street.

1289
02:29:44.04 --> 02:29:57.04
So I went down and I found a bank that said to me, you can have both double, front and windows of our bank.

1290
02:29:57.04 --> 02:30:07.04
And you can put your images up during the final Repatriation because they thought we would love people to see this imagery.

1291
02:30:07.04 --> 02:30:23.04
And the reaction that got, I was really quite nervous because there were 50 images going up printed on a one size in a bank shot went, you know, in the glass in the window.

1292
02:30:23.04 --> 02:30:33.04
And I was really quite nervous as to how people would look at it. I thought would, you know, would people appreciate this and they loved it. They loved the fact that this had been done.

1293
02:30:33.04 --> 02:30:46.04
And when I went back down to collect the images, I would say half of them, I just gave away to the pub where you have the pictures of the soldiers saluting outside the pub that everybody went to.

1294
02:30:46.04 --> 02:30:50.04
There was the old lady standing in the glass window. There was the kid wearing the Chelsea shirt.

1295
02:30:50.04 --> 02:31:03.04
All these pictures just went and I just said, listen, just put some money in the charity box and just take the prints because if all of them had gone, I would have thought that's fantastic because I didn't want to keep them.

1296
02:31:03.04 --> 02:31:09.04
I just wanted to, if somebody wants that and they want it, that's amazing and a lot of them went.

1297
02:31:09.04 --> 02:31:16.04
And that to me was vindication of having spent that time and done it, you know.

1298
02:31:16.04 --> 02:31:27.04
And during that time as a photographer, I grew because I sort of come out of that way of shooting for the wire, which is all about a single image.

1299
02:31:27.04 --> 02:31:37.04
Tell a story in the single image, you know, and I suppose ever from ever since the beginning I've always been a photographer who wanted to tell a story, but with a series of images not just.

1300
02:31:37.04 --> 02:31:56.04
And there's a skill to doing what the wire guys do and I had that skill and I did it, but I wanted to just expand my palette as a photographer and that meant spending time on stories and trying to tell it as, you know, as a complete.

1301
02:31:56.04 --> 02:32:01.04
So you could take one picture out of there and go, well, what does that mean that picture?

1302
02:32:01.04 --> 02:32:14.04
But if you put it into the set, you go, oh, okay, now I know what it means. So you're not shooting standalone images, you're shooting images that means something when they're put together as a package.

1303
02:32:14.04 --> 02:32:19.04
Yeah, and that was, yeah, it was very proud of those pictures.

1304
02:32:19.04 --> 02:32:30.04
Well, like I said, those pictures are amazing and I think they did exactly what why would pass it was what was it named a royal town?

1305
02:32:30.04 --> 02:32:40.04
Royal, Royal, wouldn't pass it. I think it reflected exactly what that, what that put forth and that is the, the pride of England, the honor of England.

1306
02:32:40.04 --> 02:32:48.04
The respect of England and I think that was all captured not only in the town, but in the images that you took.

1307
02:32:48.04 --> 02:32:57.04
And I think we've been going for a long time right now. And I think that's about all we've got for tonight.

1308
02:32:57.04 --> 02:33:02.04
I do want to say obviously.

1309
02:33:02.04 --> 02:33:06.04
Thanks for coming on. I know I worked with some photographers overseas.

1310
02:33:06.04 --> 02:33:15.04
Some of them just took incredible risks to get the capture, to capture the moments that they captured, you know, the book, the life and I wrote.

1311
02:33:15.04 --> 02:33:26.04
And the name Todd Pittman, who is there combat use, use a photographer and just took some incredible images and we were honored to be able to take those images and put them in the book.

1312
02:33:26.04 --> 02:33:37.04
But I know there's many, many obviously, many photographers, journalists around the world that take great risks to report and capture the stories and get them spread around.

1313
02:33:37.04 --> 02:33:55.04
And a lot of them are killed and you mentioned one in the beginning, but a lot there's a lot of reporters and photographers journalists that are out there in the world that they take you to risks and sometimes they pay the ultimate price for their job.

1314
02:33:55.04 --> 02:34:00.04
And I know this was, I know I said a couple of things on the podcast that were pretty rough.

1315
02:34:00.04 --> 02:34:09.04
I appreciate everyone for sticking through those tough moments. Appreciate you traveling to those places and sticking through those tough moments yourself.

1316
02:34:09.04 --> 02:34:14.04
Kieran and thanks for everybody for listening to the podcast.

1317
02:34:14.04 --> 02:34:18.04
If you do want to support the podcast.

1318
02:34:18.04 --> 02:34:23.04
Echo. Tell them how to support it, my brother.

1319
02:34:23.04 --> 02:34:33.04
Well, we didn't really talk much about working out or anything that would constitute much supplementation, but what about alpha brain?

1320
02:34:33.04 --> 02:34:36.04
Alpha brain. Yeah, that's true.

1321
02:34:36.04 --> 02:34:42.04
Yeah, because you got to be quick with your finger on the trigger of your camera.

1322
02:34:42.04 --> 02:34:44.04
In some cases, you might want to get something out of a brain.

1323
02:34:44.04 --> 02:34:49.04
Yeah, I was talking to, I was talking to somebody.

1324
02:34:49.04 --> 02:34:54.04
This is like yesterday the day before about photography.

1325
02:34:54.04 --> 02:34:59.04
And you know, people that'll see like a real good picture and they'll be like, hey, that's a good, that's a cool picture.

1326
02:34:59.04 --> 02:35:05.04
What camera did you use? Do you ever find that insulting?

1327
02:35:05.04 --> 02:35:14.04
I've heard it compared to like this girl in O'Holly. She's actor and a photographer.

1328
02:35:14.04 --> 02:35:21.04
And she said it like this. When someone asked her what kind of camera she used, like, that's a great picture.

1329
02:35:21.04 --> 02:35:23.04
What kind of camera did you use?

1330
02:35:23.04 --> 02:35:27.04
It's like saying, hey, that's a great meal. What kind of stove did you use?

1331
02:35:27.04 --> 02:35:29.04
Something like that.

1332
02:35:29.04 --> 02:35:30.04
Yeah, I know I get that.

1333
02:35:30.04 --> 02:35:34.04
Maybe it wasn't the archer. It was the bow and the area that made it a good shot.

1334
02:35:34.04 --> 02:35:35.04
Right, exactly.

1335
02:35:35.04 --> 02:35:38.04
I think I've had it the other way around. I've had people say that, wow, that's lovely.

1336
02:35:38.04 --> 02:35:41.04
Looking camera. You must have shot some great pictures with that.

1337
02:35:41.04 --> 02:35:45.04
So yeah, that's probably in like, but in reverse.

1338
02:35:45.04 --> 02:35:47.04
Yeah, you know.

1339
02:35:47.04 --> 02:35:51.04
But you keep it traditional too.

1340
02:35:51.04 --> 02:35:55.04
I mean, obviously you're doing manual focus.

1341
02:35:55.04 --> 02:35:57.04
Yeah, I'm filming a lot of times.

1342
02:35:57.04 --> 02:35:58.04
Yeah.

1343
02:35:58.04 --> 02:36:02.04
And on digital, this is the manual, manual focus on digital as well.

1344
02:36:02.04 --> 02:36:05.04
Yeah, but I've been using them for 20 or 20 years.

1345
02:36:05.04 --> 02:36:09.04
So not the like is they're not everybody's cup of tea.

1346
02:36:09.04 --> 02:36:14.04
I know a lot of professional photographers. They're not, you know, it's not their cup of tea.

1347
02:36:14.04 --> 02:36:21.04
And also, you know, it's a particular type of for the journalist, I think, that uses a camera like this.

1348
02:36:21.04 --> 02:36:26.04
And when I say particular, I mean, they shoot particular stories in a particular way.

1349
02:36:26.04 --> 02:36:29.04
It's not that, you know, they're any better than anybody else.

1350
02:36:29.04 --> 02:36:33.04
They certainly aren't. They just choose to use a camera that doesn't have long lenses.

1351
02:36:33.04 --> 02:36:35.04
And I like to use a camera that doesn't.

1352
02:36:35.04 --> 02:36:37.04
My longest lens is a 50 mil.

1353
02:36:37.04 --> 02:36:39.04
You got to spark your target.

1354
02:36:39.04 --> 02:36:41.04
Yeah, like I'm both.

1355
02:36:41.04 --> 02:36:43.04
I like to use these at quiet and you get in close.

1356
02:36:43.04 --> 02:36:46.04
Yeah, see, see, like even that, that's a graphic.

1357
02:36:46.04 --> 02:36:47.04
For like a graphic.

1358
02:36:47.04 --> 02:36:52.04
There's so much detail to the art, you know, where, of course, equipment is something.

1359
02:36:52.04 --> 02:36:53.04
Sure.

1360
02:36:53.04 --> 02:36:54.04
But like artistic part of it.

1361
02:36:54.04 --> 02:36:58.04
I think it's, I think photography gets it the most, I think.

1362
02:36:58.04 --> 02:36:58.04
Yeah.

1363
02:36:58.04 --> 02:37:01.04
Because it's like, like I said, I want to talk for now.

1364
02:37:01.04 --> 02:37:03.04
Yeah, I can take a picture.

1365
02:37:03.04 --> 02:37:04.04
Give me a good camera.

1366
02:37:04.04 --> 02:37:07.04
Like that. Everybody can, everybody has it in them to shoot a beautiful picture.

1367
02:37:07.04 --> 02:37:10.04
I'd firmly believe everybody can shoot a great picture.

1368
02:37:10.04 --> 02:37:11.04
Yeah.

1369
02:37:11.04 --> 02:37:12.04
Yeah, that's crazy.

1370
02:37:12.04 --> 02:37:14.04
But yeah, so I'll for brain boom.

1371
02:37:14.04 --> 02:37:15.04
Take some off of brain.

1372
02:37:15.04 --> 02:37:16.04
Take better pictures.

1373
02:37:16.04 --> 02:37:17.04
Yeah, there you go.

1374
02:37:17.04 --> 02:37:18.04
Right.

1375
02:37:18.04 --> 02:37:19.04
Yeah, the day.

1376
02:37:19.04 --> 02:37:20.04
There you go.

1377
02:37:20.04 --> 02:37:22.04
But you got a lug heavy camera equipment around.

1378
02:37:22.04 --> 02:37:22.04
Yeah.

1379
02:37:22.04 --> 02:37:23.04
And I want it.

1380
02:37:23.04 --> 02:37:24.04
You know, there's some shrimp tack.

1381
02:37:24.04 --> 02:37:25.04
Yeah.

1382
02:37:25.04 --> 02:37:26.04
I'm getting some shrimp tack for that one.

1383
02:37:26.04 --> 02:37:28.04
Yeah, running TV.

1384
02:37:28.04 --> 02:37:31.04
The sewage that could have helped you in the later.

1385
02:37:31.04 --> 02:37:32.04
Yeah.

1386
02:37:32.04 --> 02:37:33.04
That's right.

1387
02:37:33.04 --> 02:37:36.04
I'm just discovered these tonight as well.

1388
02:37:36.04 --> 02:37:37.04
Warrior bars boom.

1389
02:37:37.04 --> 02:37:38.04
Solid, right?

1390
02:37:38.04 --> 02:37:39.04
Yeah.

1391
02:37:39.04 --> 02:37:40.04
I'm not a good host.

1392
02:37:40.04 --> 02:37:41.04
Didn't feed him.

1393
02:37:41.04 --> 02:37:42.04
My wife.

1394
02:37:42.04 --> 02:37:43.04
What do you do?

1395
02:37:43.04 --> 02:37:44.04
I did.

1396
02:37:44.04 --> 02:37:45.04
I did.

1397
02:37:45.04 --> 02:37:47.04
What's my wife said, what is wrong with you?

1398
02:37:47.04 --> 02:37:49.04
Why don't you feed, give him some food?

1399
02:37:49.04 --> 02:37:50.04
And I said, okay, he needs food.

1400
02:37:50.04 --> 02:37:51.04
Warrior bar.

1401
02:37:51.04 --> 02:37:52.04
And she was like, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1402
02:37:52.04 --> 02:37:53.04
No, no, no, no, no.

1403
02:37:53.04 --> 02:37:54.04
Yeah.

1404
02:37:54.04 --> 02:37:55.04
Dems, man.

1405
02:37:55.04 --> 02:37:56.04
Boom.

1406

02:38:21.04 --> 02:38:22.04
Passively.

1420
02:38:22.04 --> 02:38:23.04
No.

1421
02:38:23.04 --> 02:38:24.04
Efficiently.

1422
02:38:24.04 --> 02:38:25.04
Yes.

1423
02:38:25.04 --> 02:38:25.04
Passively.

1424
02:38:25.04 --> 02:38:26.04
No.

1425
02:38:26.04 --> 02:38:28.04
We don't write things passive here at the jocoboccast.

1426
02:38:28.04 --> 02:38:31.04
We aggressively make things efficient.

1427
02:38:31.04 --> 02:38:32.04
Yes.

1428
02:38:32.04 --> 02:38:33.04
Amazon.

1429
02:38:33.04 --> 02:38:34.04
All right.

1430
02:38:34.04 --> 02:38:35.04
Well, you want to get more efficient.

1431
02:38:35.04 --> 02:38:37.04
And also UK is working.

1432
02:38:37.04 --> 02:38:38.04
Yeah.

1433
02:38:38.04 --> 02:38:39.04
UK is up solid.

1434
02:38:39.04 --> 02:38:40.04
German.

1435
02:38:40.04 --> 02:38:41.04
Working.

1436
02:38:41.04 --> 02:38:43.04
Germany is.

1437
02:38:43.04 --> 02:38:44.04
We'll be working.

1438
02:38:44.04 --> 02:38:45.04
Yeah.

1439
02:38:45.04 --> 02:38:46.04
Can it up?

1440
02:38:46.04 --> 02:38:47.04
We know.

1441
02:38:47.04 --> 02:38:48.04
We know.

1442
02:38:48.04 --> 02:38:49.04
We know.

1443
02:38:49.04 --> 02:38:50.04
We know.

1444
02:38:50.04 --> 02:38:51.04
We're working.

1445
02:38:51.04 --> 02:38:52.04
So if you're in those countries,

1446
02:38:52.04 --> 02:38:53.04
appreciate the support.

1447
02:38:53.04 --> 02:38:54.04
Yeah.

Click through.

1449
02:38:55.04 --> 02:38:56.04
You know.

1450
02:38:56.04 --> 02:38:57.04
True.

1451
02:38:57.04 --> 02:38:58.04
Oh, I like it.

1452
02:38:58.04 --> 02:38:59.04
Mm-hmm.

1453
02:38:59.04 --> 02:39:00.04
We're supporting through.

1454
02:39:00.04 --> 02:39:01.04
Amazon.

1455
02:39:01.04 --> 02:39:02.04
Just go.

1456
02:39:02.04 --> 02:39:03.04
Go to the website instead of the Amazon link.

1457
02:39:03.04 --> 02:39:04.04
Click on the trooper tool.

1458
02:39:04.04 --> 02:39:05.04
Jocobodcast.

1459
02:39:05.04 --> 02:39:06.04
Trooper tool.

1460
02:39:06.04 --> 02:39:07.04
Chrome extension.

1461
02:39:07.04 --> 02:39:08.04
Boom.

1462
02:39:08.04 --> 02:39:09.04
Add the little thing on your browser.

1463
02:39:09.04 --> 02:39:10.04

1464
02:39:10.04 --> 02:39:11.04
Support every time you.

1465
02:39:11.04 --> 02:39:12.04
Every time you.

1466
02:39:12.04 --> 02:39:13.04
You shop.

1467
02:39:13.04 --> 02:39:14.04
Amazon.

1468
02:39:14.04 --> 02:39:15.04
That's legit.

1469
02:39:15.04 --> 02:39:16.04
Very legit.

1470
02:39:16.04 --> 02:39:17.04
My opinion.

1471
02:39:17.04 --> 02:39:18.04
Thanks again.

1472
02:39:18.04 --> 02:39:19.04
Brady for that one.

1473
02:39:19.04 --> 02:39:20.04
Tech genius.

1474
02:39:20.04 --> 02:39:22.04
Jiu Jitsu student.

1475
02:39:22.04 --> 02:39:23.04
And.

1476
02:39:23.04 --> 02:39:25.04
If you were T shirts.

1477
02:39:25.04 --> 02:39:26.04
Go to jocobstore.com.

1478
02:39:26.04 --> 02:39:28.04
You might like some of those.

1479
02:39:28.04 --> 02:39:30.04
You know, discipline equals freedom.

1480
02:39:30.04 --> 02:39:33.04
Jocob's head says good backwards.

1481
02:39:33.04 --> 02:39:34.04
The good is backwards.

1482
02:39:34.04 --> 02:39:35.04
So when you look in the mirror,

1483
02:39:35.04 --> 02:39:37.04
it's a message to you.

1484
02:39:37.04 --> 02:39:38.04
That's not for other people.

1485
02:39:38.04 --> 02:39:39.04
It's not for other people.

1486
02:39:39.04 --> 02:39:40.04
Just like this podcast.

1487
02:39:40.04 --> 02:39:41.04
It's for you.

1488
02:39:41.04 --> 02:39:42.04
Everybody.

1489
02:39:42.04 --> 02:39:43.04
This podcast is for you.

1490
02:39:43.04 --> 02:39:44.04
That's right.

1491
02:39:44.04 --> 02:39:45.04
Stickers.

1492
02:39:45.04 --> 02:39:48.04
But yeah, stickers on there and travel mugs.

1493
02:39:48.04 --> 02:39:50.04
People are posting cool.

1494
02:39:50.04 --> 02:39:52.04
Bumper stickers.

1495
02:39:52.04 --> 02:39:53.04
But then I'm putting them on their bumpers.

1496
02:39:53.04 --> 02:39:54.04
No, no.

1497
02:39:54.04 --> 02:39:55.04
They're putting them on their spot rack.

1498
02:39:55.04 --> 02:39:56.04
Yep.

1499
02:39:56.04 --> 02:39:57.04
Like that.

1500
02:39:57.04 --> 02:39:59.04
You know, I go in my desk and my whiteboard.

1501
02:39:59.04 --> 02:40:00.04
Yep.

1502
02:40:00.04 --> 02:40:01.04
You know.

1503
02:40:01.04 --> 02:40:03.04
Also, yeah, the stickers are bumper stickers.

1504
02:40:03.04 --> 02:40:04.04
But they're for everything for sure.

1505
02:40:04.04 --> 02:40:05.04
Yeah.

1506
02:40:05.04 --> 02:40:06.04
So if you like that stuff.

1507
02:40:06.04 --> 02:40:08.04
Um, yeah, man, you can support that way.

1508
02:40:08.04 --> 02:40:09.04
That's a cool way.

1509
02:40:09.04 --> 02:40:10.04
Get one of those.

1510
02:40:10.04 --> 02:40:11.04
We'll send it to you.

1511
02:40:11.04 --> 02:40:13.04
Another thing we got common.

1512
02:40:13.04 --> 02:40:15.04
Little bit of jocco white tea.

1513
02:40:15.04 --> 02:40:17.04
Pama granite style.

1514
02:40:17.04 --> 02:40:18.04
You know,

1515
02:40:18.04 --> 02:40:21.04
Should be coming out in the next few weeks.

1516
02:40:21.04 --> 02:40:23.04
Just to keep checking back to the website.

1517
02:40:23.04 --> 02:40:26.04
It comes in a cool tin.

1518
02:40:26.04 --> 02:40:29.04
And it says jocco white tea on it.

1519
02:40:29.04 --> 02:40:31.04
Pama granite.

1520
02:40:31.04 --> 02:40:33.04
Because that's how I do things.

1521
02:40:33.04 --> 02:40:37.04
People like what we need to do is come up with a really cool name for the podcast.

1522
02:40:37.04 --> 02:40:39.04
And I go, okay, jocco podcast.

1523
02:40:39.04 --> 02:40:42.04
But we need to come up with a cool name for the jocco white tea.

1524
02:40:42.04 --> 02:40:43.04
Okay.

1525
02:40:43.04 --> 02:40:44.04
Jocco white tea.

1526
02:40:44.04 --> 02:40:45.04
Boom.

1527
02:40:45.04 --> 02:40:47.04
Because we're not, you know,

1528
02:40:47.04 --> 02:40:49.04
We're just doing, we're just trying to keep things simple.

1529
02:40:49.04 --> 02:40:50.04
Yeah.

1530
02:40:50.04 --> 02:40:51.04
You're the one of the laws of combat.

1531
02:40:51.04 --> 02:40:53.04
How you doing now? So, so check that out.

1532
02:40:53.04 --> 02:40:54.04
It is Pama granite.

1533
02:40:54.04 --> 02:40:58.04
It's, well, obviously, I talked about that on the first.

1534
02:40:58.04 --> 02:41:02.04
My introduction to the world was when Tim Ferris said,

1535
02:41:02.04 --> 02:41:05.04
I mixed up some Pama granite and you know,

1536
02:41:05.04 --> 02:41:08.04
Tim, he's a, he's an affectionate of tea.

1537
02:41:08.04 --> 02:41:09.04
Did that catch that?

1538
02:41:09.04 --> 02:41:10.04
Yeah.

1539
02:41:10.04 --> 02:41:11.04
That too.

1540
02:41:11.04 --> 02:41:12.04
Yeah.

1541
02:41:12.04 --> 02:41:19.04
He has a special kettle where you press what kind of tea you're drinking.

1542
02:41:19.04 --> 02:41:23.04
And it's going to bring it to the appropriate temperature for that type of tea.

1543
02:41:23.04 --> 02:41:24.04
Granted tea, white tea, black tea.

1544
02:41:24.04 --> 02:41:27.04
It's, it's going to do it right. He's got that thing.

1545
02:41:27.04 --> 02:41:28.04
He's got like a little shelf.

1546
02:41:28.04 --> 02:41:29.04
He's into his tea.

1547
02:41:29.04 --> 02:41:33.04
But he, I've had the white Pama granite tea before.

1548
02:41:33.04 --> 02:41:34.04
So when I showed up and I said,

1549
02:41:34.04 --> 02:41:35.04
Hey, you want some of this?

1550
02:41:35.04 --> 02:41:37.04
And so I mixed it up for him and he's drinking it.

1551
02:41:37.04 --> 02:41:40.04
And we were starting the podcast in, you know, like,

1552
02:41:40.04 --> 02:41:43.04
20 minutes and 12 minutes later.

1553
02:41:43.04 --> 02:41:44.04
He starts going, yeah.

1554
02:41:44.04 --> 02:41:46.04
But that, what kind of tea was that?

1555
02:41:46.04 --> 02:41:47.04
He was all kinds of fire.

1556
02:41:47.04 --> 02:41:52.04
So then the next thing that happened was on Amazon,

1557
02:41:52.04 --> 02:41:56.04
I would see people with order extreme ownership.

1558
02:41:56.04 --> 02:41:59.04
And then it would be like, oh, people that brought extreme ownership.

1559
02:41:59.04 --> 02:42:01.04
Also bought Parma granite, white tea.

1560
02:42:01.04 --> 02:42:04.04
And then finding one of the tea people said, hey,

1561
02:42:04.04 --> 02:42:06.04
you need to have your own tea.

1562
02:42:06.04 --> 02:42:09.04
And I said, okay, start, I'll make my own tea.

1563
02:42:09.04 --> 02:42:11.04
But it's going to be good.

1564
02:42:11.04 --> 02:42:12.04
Real good.

1565
02:42:12.04 --> 02:42:13.04
So I went through a book.

1566
02:42:13.04 --> 02:42:16.04
It took a while because I kept saying, no, no, no, do this.

1567
02:42:16.04 --> 02:42:17.04
No, a little bit more of that.

1568
02:42:17.04 --> 02:42:20.04
And finally, we got to the tea that not only tastes good,

1569
02:42:20.04 --> 02:42:23.04
but it gives you the white bomb, and we're going to deep power.

1570
02:42:23.04 --> 02:42:25.04
So, be looking for that.

1571
02:42:25.04 --> 02:42:29.04
Speaking of extreme ownership, you can buy that book written by myself.

1572
02:42:29.04 --> 02:42:32.04
And my brother, Dave Babin, you can get unharred cover.

1573
02:42:32.04 --> 02:42:35.04
Where you can make lots of notes and put little tabs in there

1574
02:42:35.04 --> 02:42:36.04
and highlight stuff.

1575
02:42:36.04 --> 02:42:38.04
You can buy it on digital.

1576
02:42:38.04 --> 02:42:40.04
I think you can make notes on digital too.

1577
02:42:40.04 --> 02:42:42.04
But it doesn't look as cool.

1578
02:42:42.04 --> 02:42:43.04
Kindle.

1579
02:42:43.04 --> 02:42:44.04
Yeah, you can put notes and kiddo.

1580
02:42:44.04 --> 02:42:47.04
Like, why use the Kindle app and,

1581
02:42:47.04 --> 02:42:50.04
I don't know what I did without.

1582
02:42:50.04 --> 02:42:52.04
Well, I didn't really read it before that.

1583
02:42:52.04 --> 02:42:54.04
But I'm just saying that you can do notes,

1584
02:42:54.04 --> 02:42:57.04
color code, every all I am and all of your finger

1585
02:42:57.04 --> 02:42:58.04
is really good.

1586
02:42:58.04 --> 02:42:59.04
That's good.

1587
02:42:59.04 --> 02:43:00.04
And I'm glad you did that.

1588
02:43:00.04 --> 02:43:02.04
Me personally, I need to have physical,

1589
02:43:02.04 --> 02:43:04.04
you know, no, I got my pens lined up,

1590
02:43:04.04 --> 02:43:06.04
highlighters lined up, you know,

1591
02:43:06.04 --> 02:43:07.04
I think it's worth the physical.

1592
02:43:07.04 --> 02:43:10.04
I mean, can I really do the podcast from a Kindle?

1593
02:43:10.04 --> 02:43:11.04
Is that going to work?

1594
02:43:11.04 --> 02:43:12.04
No.

1595
02:43:12.04 --> 02:43:13.04
We would have to shut down the podcast.

1596
02:43:13.04 --> 02:43:16.04
Well, you'd have to learn how to use the Kindle first.

1597
02:43:16.04 --> 02:43:19.04
You would, oh, I'd have to free my mind a little bit.

1598
02:43:19.04 --> 02:43:23.04
Then also the extreme ownership,

1599
02:43:23.04 --> 02:43:26.04
muster, which is a little conference.

1600
02:43:26.04 --> 02:43:29.04
We're having out here in San Diego, California.

1601
02:43:29.04 --> 02:43:32.04
If you want to talk about all this stuff in depth

1602
02:43:32.04 --> 02:43:35.04
with some real focus,

1603
02:43:35.04 --> 02:43:38.04
myself, lathe, running this thing out here in San Diego,

1604
02:43:38.04 --> 02:43:41.04
California, leadership conference.

1605
02:43:41.04 --> 02:43:44.04
But that's the one way of looking at it.

1606
02:43:44.04 --> 02:43:50.04
Another way of looking at is frontal assault on your brain.

1607
02:43:50.04 --> 02:43:51.04
So come and get some of that.

1608
02:43:51.04 --> 02:43:54.04
October 20th and 21st.

1609
02:43:54.04 --> 02:43:58.04
Check out echelonfront.com for some details on that.

1610
02:43:58.04 --> 02:44:01.04
And also, if you want to continue this conversation,

1611
02:44:01.04 --> 02:44:05.04
you know that we're all up upon the interwebs.

1612
02:44:05.04 --> 02:44:09.04
Echo is at Echo Charles.

1613
02:44:09.04 --> 02:44:15.04
And I am at Jockel Willink, Twitter, Facebook,

1614
02:44:15.04 --> 02:44:23.04
Instagram, Karen is also on those various mediums.

1615
02:44:23.04 --> 02:44:25.04
And he's...

1616
02:44:25.04 --> 02:44:27.04
Suspela, spell it.

1617
02:44:27.04 --> 02:44:28.04
Okay.

1618
02:44:28.04 --> 02:44:30.04
It's at, I.M.

1619
02:44:30.04 --> 02:44:32.04
K.I.E.R.A.N.

1620
02:44:32.04 --> 02:44:36.04
D.O.H.E.R.T.Y.

1621
02:44:36.04 --> 02:44:40.04
And it's the same on Instagram.

1622
02:44:40.04 --> 02:44:42.04
I'm hearing D.O.H.E.R.T.R.D.

1623
02:44:42.04 --> 02:44:44.04
I am Karen Dorses.

1624
02:44:44.04 --> 02:44:45.04
But it's not, I am.

1625
02:44:45.04 --> 02:44:45.04
Write it.

1626
02:44:45.04 --> 02:44:48.04
That's a common one though, like, people,

1627
02:44:48.04 --> 02:44:49.04
okay, because it's not like it's like,

1628
02:44:49.04 --> 02:44:51.04
oh, shoot, you know, like, what repeat that,

1629
02:44:51.04 --> 02:44:54.04
because that's a common one, like they'll put duh or I'm...

1630
02:44:54.04 --> 02:44:56.04
or, like, I don't know,

1631
02:44:56.04 --> 02:44:57.04
M.M.A.T.R.E.R.T.

1632
02:44:57.04 --> 02:44:58.04
So that's a common one.

1633
02:44:58.04 --> 02:45:00.04
That's not that hard to remember, is what I'm saying.

1634
02:45:00.04 --> 02:45:05.04
India, Mike Kilo, India, Echo, on down the line.

1635
02:45:06.20 --> 02:45:07.52
I'll put in the link.

1636
02:45:07.52 --> 02:45:09.08
Romeo, off of November.

1637
02:45:09.08 --> 02:45:11.92
And I'm used to Twitter, so I really need some friends.

1638
02:45:11.92 --> 02:45:14.24
Just followers.

1639
02:45:14.24 --> 02:45:15.72
Oh, sorry, follows.

1640
02:45:15.72 --> 02:45:19.04
But actually, you have, you do Instagram.

1641
02:45:19.04 --> 02:45:19.88
I do Instagram.

1642
02:45:19.88 --> 02:45:21.16
I guess that one's a little more obvious for you

1643
02:45:21.16 --> 02:45:23.000
since you take pictures with that.

1644
02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:23.84
Yeah.

1645
02:45:23.84 --> 02:45:24.72
And it's a camera thing.

1646
02:45:24.72 --> 02:45:25.24
Yeah.

1647
02:45:25.24 --> 02:45:26.08
Yeah.

1648
02:45:26.08 --> 02:45:26.92
Which is all I see out.

1649
02:45:26.92 --> 02:45:27.44
Yeah.

1650
02:45:27.44 --> 02:45:28.68
Since you're a photographer.

1651
02:45:28.68 --> 02:45:30.36
We want to know.

1652
02:45:30.36 --> 02:45:33.60
And so, Karen, once again, thanks for coming on.

1653
02:45:33.60 --> 02:45:34.60
My pleasure.

1654
02:45:34.60 --> 02:45:35.24
Thanks for sharing these stories.

1655
02:45:35.24 --> 02:45:38.12
There was also to talk to you and good to see you again.

1656
02:45:38.12 --> 02:45:44.28
And of course, to the troopers out there.

1657
02:45:44.28 --> 02:45:45.60
That'll listen to this podcast.

1658
02:45:45.60 --> 02:45:48.40
Thanks for joining us here.

1659
02:45:48.40 --> 02:45:53.000
Thanks for looking at the world.

1660
02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:57.000
And even if you're not taking pictures of the world

1661
02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:03.28
at least take the time to appreciate it, all of it.

1662
02:46:03.28 --> 02:46:07.72
The good and the bad, the light and the dark.

1663
02:46:07.72 --> 02:46:14.28
And while you're out there in the world, go ahead and make sure

1664
02:46:14.28 --> 02:46:19.60
you get after it, too.

1665
02:46:19.60 --> 02:46:26.96
So until next time, this is Karen and Echo and Jockel.

1666
02:46:26.96 --> 02:46:27.96
Out.
