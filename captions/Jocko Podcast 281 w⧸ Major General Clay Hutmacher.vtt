00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.10
This is Jockel Podcast number 281 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing, good evening,

2
00:00:06.10 --> 00:00:07.10
echo.

3
00:00:07.10 --> 00:00:08.10
Good evening.

4
00:00:08.10 --> 00:00:10.10
Alarm goes off.

5
00:00:10.10 --> 00:00:12.10
I wake up.

6
00:00:12.10 --> 00:00:14.10
It's 0-600.

7
00:00:14.10 --> 00:00:17.50
Same time I woke up yesterday.

8
00:00:17.50 --> 00:00:18.80
And the day before.

9
00:00:18.80 --> 00:00:24.50
Actually since June 28th, almost 120 days ago.

10
00:00:24.50 --> 00:00:27.40
Four months.

11
00:00:27.40 --> 00:00:32.72
It's okay though because if anyone in the Persian Gulf tries to interfere with the policies

12
00:00:32.72 --> 00:00:39.70
of my sacred country, the United States of America, I'll be there to stop them.

13
00:00:39.70 --> 00:00:44.64
Two months ago, it was anyone in the Mediterranean.

14
00:00:44.64 --> 00:00:49.34
Actually we could stop anyone in the world.

15
00:00:49.34 --> 00:00:51.58
Breakfast time.

16
00:00:51.58 --> 00:00:53.80
45 minute weight in line.

17
00:00:53.80 --> 00:00:55.38
Every meal is the same.

18
00:00:55.38 --> 00:00:58.62
In line sweating.

19
00:00:58.62 --> 00:00:59.70
That's okay though.

20
00:00:59.70 --> 00:01:04.86
There are people in my country who neither know nor care that their freedom is being protected

21
00:01:04.86 --> 00:01:08.86
at this very moment.

22
00:01:08.86 --> 00:01:14.34
That too is okay because I do know.

23
00:01:14.34 --> 00:01:17.26
I'm doing it.

24
00:01:17.26 --> 00:01:19.38
Go to work.

25
00:01:19.38 --> 00:01:22.98
The same routine day in and day out.

26
00:01:22.98 --> 00:01:28.78
It could be compared to being in jail except that the work we do is too hard and too dangerous

27
00:01:28.78 --> 00:01:33.66
to impose upon a common criminal.

28
00:01:33.66 --> 00:01:37.86
It would be considered inhumane.

29
00:01:37.86 --> 00:01:40.22
That's okay though.

30
00:01:40.22 --> 00:01:49.50
I understand freedom and the sacrifices that have to be made for freedom to be achieved.

31
00:01:49.50 --> 00:01:57.66
The life we live at the cost of our military members cannot have a price put on it.

32
00:01:57.66 --> 00:02:02.74
If you saw our paychecks, you would understand.

33
00:02:02.74 --> 00:02:04.78
Dinner time.

34
00:02:04.78 --> 00:02:07.74
Chicken and rice again.

35
00:02:07.74 --> 00:02:10.34
That's okay.

36
00:02:10.34 --> 00:02:16.26
The opportunities we have in the States are limitless.

37
00:02:16.26 --> 00:02:26.58
There's nothing that any person cannot achieve if he or she has the heart.

38
00:02:26.58 --> 00:02:31.78
They don't have those opportunities in the parts I've visited.

39
00:02:31.78 --> 00:02:39.14
They don't even have Taco Bell.

40
00:02:39.14 --> 00:02:52.82
That right there is a letter written by Steve Voight, written on October 23rd, 1996.

41
00:02:52.82 --> 00:02:58.62
He was killed in a helicopter crash on October 25th, 1996, two days after he wrote that

42
00:02:58.62 --> 00:03:01.94
letter.

43
00:03:01.94 --> 00:03:05.26
Steve was at Cilteam 8.

44
00:03:05.26 --> 00:03:10.50
And that helicopter crash happened while they were training.

45
00:03:10.50 --> 00:03:15.22
And I went through Cilteam with Steve in 1991.

46
00:03:15.22 --> 00:03:17.42
Buds Class 177.

47
00:03:17.42 --> 00:03:21.14
He was an old man at the time.

48
00:03:21.14 --> 00:03:24.78
He was like 28 or 29 years old.

49
00:03:24.78 --> 00:03:32.90
He was our class leading petty officer.

50
00:03:32.90 --> 00:03:35.22
It was just an awesome guy.

51
00:03:35.22 --> 00:03:36.70
I know he was from the South.

52
00:03:36.70 --> 00:03:38.42
I think he was born in Georgia.

53
00:03:38.42 --> 00:03:44.18
But he didn't have a typical Southern accent.

54
00:03:44.18 --> 00:03:52.86
He had this other voice that probably one of the most distinctive voices I've ever known.

55
00:03:52.86 --> 00:03:55.78
He was really loud.

56
00:03:55.78 --> 00:04:00.54
We had this distinctive loud, funny voice.

57
00:04:00.54 --> 00:04:03.74
It was called to like this.

58
00:04:03.74 --> 00:04:06.14
It's a guy's get over here.

59
00:04:06.14 --> 00:04:09.58
He had this just totally distinctive voice.

60
00:04:09.58 --> 00:04:13.58
You couldn't miss it.

61
00:04:13.58 --> 00:04:14.98
He was tough as hell.

62
00:04:14.98 --> 00:04:18.50
And the instructors tried to crush him all the time.

63
00:04:18.50 --> 00:04:20.78
He was an older guy and a senior guy.

64
00:04:20.78 --> 00:04:23.10
He was a first class petty officer.

65
00:04:23.10 --> 00:04:27.58
Being that senior going through basic seal training, the instructors are going to get at

66
00:04:27.58 --> 00:04:28.58
you.

67
00:04:28.58 --> 00:04:31.90
And they hammered him.

68
00:04:31.90 --> 00:04:34.26
But they couldn't break him at all.

69
00:04:34.26 --> 00:04:37.54
They actually couldn't even get him to crack a little bit.

70
00:04:37.54 --> 00:04:42.66
Because they'd be punishing him and he'd be hitting the surf and he'd be doing pushups

71
00:04:42.66 --> 00:04:44.70
and he'd be doing sprints.

72
00:04:44.70 --> 00:04:49.54
And they'd ask him about something and he'd still come off the same with that loud.

73
00:04:49.54 --> 00:04:55.70
Just crazy, funny voice and weed rally right around him.

74
00:04:55.70 --> 00:05:02.14
Just a freaking awesome guy.

75
00:05:02.14 --> 00:05:09.30
And when he died, you know, it was 1996.

76
00:05:09.30 --> 00:05:11.02
There's no war going on, right?

77
00:05:11.02 --> 00:05:22.90
So it was definitely a shock to the system to have someone killed like that.

78
00:05:22.90 --> 00:05:25.38
And I'm just tragic and horrible.

79
00:05:25.38 --> 00:05:29.58
And I knew that he had a son and he had had a son.

80
00:05:29.58 --> 00:05:31.90
Because like I said, he was older.

81
00:05:31.90 --> 00:05:33.58
He had a son that was named after him.

82
00:05:33.58 --> 00:05:38.58
Another, another Stephen Void.

83
00:05:38.58 --> 00:05:39.58
And I knew that.

84
00:05:39.58 --> 00:05:41.62
But I'd kind of lost track with him.

85
00:05:41.62 --> 00:05:42.62
I was on the West Coast.

86
00:05:42.62 --> 00:05:43.62
He was on the East Coast.

87
00:05:43.62 --> 00:05:47.42
I didn't go to the funeral for whatever reason.

88
00:05:47.42 --> 00:05:55.38
I just carried on with my career and continue to try and serve to the best of my ability.

89
00:05:55.38 --> 00:06:03.94
Always remembering, always remembering Steve Void and his sacrifice.

90
00:06:03.94 --> 00:06:06.06
What about a son?

91
00:06:06.06 --> 00:06:08.34
They're what happened to him.

92
00:06:08.34 --> 00:06:17.10
Well, fortunately, fortunately, there was support for him.

93
00:06:17.10 --> 00:06:21.10
And he was able to grow up and he was able to go to college.

94
00:06:21.10 --> 00:06:28.42
And all that was taken care of by a group called the Special Operations or your foundation.

95
00:06:28.42 --> 00:06:32.10
And what that group is is one of the things that they do.

96
00:06:32.10 --> 00:06:37.66
One of the main things that they do is they take care of the children of fallen members

97
00:06:37.66 --> 00:06:41.90
of the Special Operations community.

98
00:06:41.90 --> 00:06:46.38
And Steve's son got taken care of in that respect.

99
00:06:46.38 --> 00:06:54.22
And the Special Operations Warrior Foundation stepped up and paid for his education and gave

100
00:06:54.22 --> 00:07:02.86
young Stephen the opportunities that his father was not there to give to him.

101
00:07:02.86 --> 00:07:08.06
But that his dad had sacrificed for.

102
00:07:08.06 --> 00:07:14.02
And this story is one of thousands of stories of thousands of families that have been

103
00:07:14.02 --> 00:07:17.18
helped by this foundation.

104
00:07:17.18 --> 00:07:22.58
And we are lucky enough today to have the president and the CEO of this incredible charity

105
00:07:22.58 --> 00:07:25.46
here.

106
00:07:25.46 --> 00:07:36.52
A man who has quite a story of his own from an enlisted Marine at age 17 to 41 years of service

107
00:07:36.52 --> 00:07:45.28
resulting in the rank of major general two star with service in Panama, Iraq, Afghanistan and

108
00:07:45.28 --> 00:07:49.08
a bunch of other places around the world.

109
00:07:49.08 --> 00:07:51.68
General Clay Hotmacher.

110
00:07:51.68 --> 00:07:54.08
Clay.

111
00:07:54.08 --> 00:07:55.08
Thanks for joining us.

112
00:07:55.08 --> 00:07:56.60
Hey, thanks for having me, Jacob.

113
00:07:56.60 --> 00:07:57.60
I appreciate it.

114
00:07:57.60 --> 00:07:58.60
That's a great story.

115
00:07:58.60 --> 00:08:00.24
I had never heard of that letter.

116
00:08:00.24 --> 00:08:01.48
I appreciate your sharing.

117
00:08:01.48 --> 00:08:07.68
I was looking at some videos that y'all have produced and Steve Voitt's picture.

118
00:08:07.68 --> 00:08:12.52
I mean, just a picture of him and his son when his son's young and man, I couldn't

119
00:08:12.52 --> 00:08:14.36
believe when I saw that.

120
00:08:14.36 --> 00:08:19.48
And it struck me that, you know, I was in the military.

121
00:08:19.48 --> 00:08:20.48
What can you do?

122
00:08:20.48 --> 00:08:23.88
This is something that we always feel when you're in the military.

123
00:08:23.88 --> 00:08:26.48
You lose somebody.

124
00:08:26.48 --> 00:08:31.04
You want to help, but you also have a job and you're going to continue to do that job.

125
00:08:31.04 --> 00:08:36.20
And so organizations like yours that can pick up the slack for the guys that are still

126
00:08:36.20 --> 00:08:41.64
serving and have a long term strategic plan to take care of these families and just seeing

127
00:08:41.64 --> 00:08:43.92
his son who definitely looks like him.

128
00:08:43.92 --> 00:08:50.08
You guys have a video of him on there as well and just seeing his son who looks like him,

129
00:08:50.08 --> 00:08:51.92
doesn't quite sound like him.

130
00:08:51.92 --> 00:08:53.32
Doesn't quite sound like him.

131
00:08:53.32 --> 00:08:54.76
Man, his voice was distinctive.

132
00:08:54.76 --> 00:08:59.84
Hey, who are you guys doing over there?

133
00:08:59.84 --> 00:09:06.80
Just awesome to that you have that organization that helps in that respect.

134
00:09:06.80 --> 00:09:09.48
So we'll get to that.

135
00:09:09.48 --> 00:09:13.48
But before we get to that, let's start at, well, let's start at the beginning.

136
00:09:13.48 --> 00:09:14.96
I was like, start at the beginning.

137
00:09:14.96 --> 00:09:17.48
So where did you grow up?

138
00:09:17.48 --> 00:09:19.12
I grew up in Washington State.

139
00:09:19.12 --> 00:09:25.68
I was born and went out to Washington, bounced around a bit and ended up before I joined

140
00:09:25.68 --> 00:09:32.20
military in a little town outside of Everett Washington called Lake Stevens.

141
00:09:32.20 --> 00:09:37.04
I was living in a foster home, dropped out of high school and all I knew is I needed

142
00:09:37.04 --> 00:09:41.72
to kick in the ass and I figured, well, the Marines, they'll definitely do that and they

143
00:09:41.72 --> 00:09:44.32
did not disappoint.

144
00:09:44.32 --> 00:09:47.88
So you were in foster homes from what age?

145
00:09:47.88 --> 00:09:51.32
That was maybe I joined when I was 17.

146
00:09:51.32 --> 00:09:53.04
I guess, 15.

147
00:09:53.04 --> 00:09:58.16
My parents divorced when I was young and I bounced around and then a lot of this was

148
00:09:58.16 --> 00:09:59.16
my own doing.

149
00:09:59.16 --> 00:10:03.76
It would be perfectly honest where the eye was, you know, done with my parents and wanted

150
00:10:03.76 --> 00:10:08.48
to, you know, they had moved from Lake Stevens and I was like, hey, I'm not doing that

151
00:10:08.48 --> 00:10:11.88
with all the wisdom that I've 15 year old.

152
00:10:11.88 --> 00:10:14.000
And so this is what?

153
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
1975.

154
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.92
Yeah, if you want to round up a couple of years, I'll be fine too.

155
00:10:18.92 --> 00:10:22.24
But I'm saying, in 1975, you're 15 years old.

156
00:10:22.24 --> 00:10:23.24
You're living in foster homes.

157
00:10:23.24 --> 00:10:24.80
You're like to hell with the parents.

158
00:10:24.80 --> 00:10:26.92
I'm doing my own thing.

159
00:10:26.92 --> 00:10:31.60
What did you have any, did you think?

160
00:10:31.60 --> 00:10:34.56
We just just short-sighted, not.

161
00:10:34.56 --> 00:10:38.32
Well, it was, you know, actually it was a little later than that.

162
00:10:38.32 --> 00:10:39.64
My mother was a writer.

163
00:10:39.64 --> 00:10:44.000
She passed away last year or December, a year ago last December.

164
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.96
And she was in South Africa.

165
00:10:45.96 --> 00:10:49.72
If you ever saw that movie, cry for you to them with Denzel Washington, it was about

166
00:10:49.72 --> 00:10:54.28
this guy Donald Woods who was the editor of a newspaper over there, which was on the coast

167
00:10:54.28 --> 00:10:55.28
of South Africa.

168
00:10:55.28 --> 00:10:56.80
She worked for him.

169
00:10:56.80 --> 00:11:00.24
So I lost that whole year over there with her in the early 76.

170
00:11:00.24 --> 00:11:02.48
I came back because it's a cool didn't count.

171
00:11:02.48 --> 00:11:03.80
Oh, so you went there.

172
00:11:03.80 --> 00:11:08.68
You went to South Africa, I lived in East London, South Africa between Durban and Cape Town.

173
00:11:08.68 --> 00:11:10.76
And that was a little slice of the Marine Corps right there.

174
00:11:10.76 --> 00:11:15.04
I mean, uniforms, haircuts, and school, and the whole deal, which, you know, I did not

175
00:11:15.04 --> 00:11:16.04
adjust well with that.

176
00:11:16.04 --> 00:11:20.36
By the way, and received the canning numerous canings for that.

177
00:11:20.36 --> 00:11:21.84
Oh, they got their corporal punishment.

178
00:11:21.84 --> 00:11:23.24
Oh, yeah, bamboo canes.

179
00:11:23.24 --> 00:11:29.48
I mean, once in a wet speedo for not counting off properly and mandatory PT and, you know,

180
00:11:29.48 --> 00:11:30.92
I got religion pretty quick.

181
00:11:30.92 --> 00:11:32.84
Learned how to count for sure.

182
00:11:32.84 --> 00:11:37.48
But yeah, it's a prime apartheid time night to what.

183
00:11:37.48 --> 00:11:41.52
Yeah, and this was this newspaper was obviously against apartheid.

184
00:11:41.52 --> 00:11:44.96
So, you know, we're writing a middle of all that.

185
00:11:44.96 --> 00:11:49.72
I mean, it was really stark seeing the way that the way life was over there.

186
00:11:49.72 --> 00:11:51.04
So anyway, I came back from that.

187
00:11:51.04 --> 00:11:55.32
I'd lost here in high school and I'm like, well, you know, look, I wasn't, you know,

188
00:11:55.32 --> 00:11:57.20
an academic champion anyway.

189
00:11:57.20 --> 00:12:00.40
So I was like, I'm just going to join the Marines.

190
00:12:00.40 --> 00:12:04.72
And I got back from there, didn't want to move back where my dad was.

191
00:12:04.72 --> 00:12:07.28
I was living with a guy and then a foster home took me in.

192
00:12:07.28 --> 00:12:08.76
It was a pretty cool story.

193
00:12:08.76 --> 00:12:14.48
He, this family, the Williams family, I'm still in very close touch with him.

194
00:12:14.48 --> 00:12:19.44
There son had died and he was a modal cross racing is big up there for teenagers.

195
00:12:19.44 --> 00:12:20.44
And he had died.

196
00:12:20.44 --> 00:12:24.88
He was my classmate, Jeff Williams, and he had died in a motorcycle crash.

197
00:12:24.88 --> 00:12:27.68
And so I knew the family from afar, not close.

198
00:12:27.68 --> 00:12:30.72
I wasn't close friends with Jeff, but we knew each other.

199
00:12:30.72 --> 00:12:35.72
And so that it was sort of fortuitous, you know, that I providence that I came in his

200
00:12:35.72 --> 00:12:37.92
same age and ended up with his family.

201
00:12:37.92 --> 00:12:44.24
And her father, Charlie Williams, was a former Marine from Korea.

202
00:12:44.24 --> 00:12:46.08
So he was telling me about the Marine Corps.

203
00:12:46.08 --> 00:12:53.96
And I see also I need to sign up and shipped out to the warm and brace of the Marine Corps.

204
00:12:53.96 --> 00:12:56.56
So what did you do in Korea?

205
00:12:56.56 --> 00:12:59.52
Did you capture some of those stories?

206
00:12:59.52 --> 00:13:00.52
He was in Korea.

207
00:13:00.52 --> 00:13:01.52
No.

208
00:13:01.52 --> 00:13:04.68
Yeah, he was, I think he was a combat engineer.

209
00:13:04.68 --> 00:13:10.28
And so he was, I mean, I don't remember a lot of them, but he talked a lot about combat

210
00:13:10.28 --> 00:13:14.20
and how bad it's like, but really the best stories for him were boot camp.

211
00:13:14.20 --> 00:13:16.68
You know, they pulled all of it.

212
00:13:16.68 --> 00:13:17.68
I never forget one.

213
00:13:17.68 --> 00:13:20.68
He said they pulled all of his teeth out and were given them dentures.

214
00:13:20.68 --> 00:13:22.36
You know, when he's in boot camp, right?

215
00:13:22.36 --> 00:13:26.76
So obviously dental care was not high on his priority list.

216
00:13:26.76 --> 00:13:30.76
And right after he had that he had stitches in his mouth and the drill instructor pulled

217
00:13:30.76 --> 00:13:34.80
his dog tags, pulled him towards Murlfast and then extended his fist and punched him

218
00:13:34.80 --> 00:13:39.04
in the mouth and his whole mouth exploded with blood and everything else.

219
00:13:39.04 --> 00:13:40.44
We supposed to be laughing at this.

220
00:13:40.44 --> 00:13:41.44
Yeah.

221
00:13:41.44 --> 00:13:42.96
I was like, I was like, I think I'll join.

222
00:13:42.96 --> 00:13:47.20
And also, I mean, those were most of his stories for the trauma.

223
00:13:47.20 --> 00:13:53.32
You know, when I look at full metal jacket and those boot camp scenes, I mean, my DI set

224
00:13:53.32 --> 00:13:57.44
a lot of those same phrases that they were, I mean, I thought that was authentic.

225
00:13:57.44 --> 00:13:59.36
What was that guy who ended up being an actor?

226
00:13:59.36 --> 00:14:00.36
Oh, the Army.

227
00:14:00.36 --> 00:14:01.36
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

228
00:14:01.36 --> 00:14:05.44
He was, you know, the, I guess the first he was a technical guy, but then he ended up

229
00:14:05.44 --> 00:14:09.28
playing a part and I was like, that dude could have been staff sergeant, Amarine, who

230
00:14:09.28 --> 00:14:12.80
was my senior DI when I went through his mouth.

231
00:14:12.80 --> 00:14:14.64
You showed up there in 1978.

232
00:14:14.64 --> 00:14:18.52
So these guys are, you're still getting Vietnam guys.

233
00:14:18.52 --> 00:14:20.20
Oh, you're, you're drone structures.

234
00:14:20.20 --> 00:14:24.08
Yeah, my company, you know, in the Marine Corps and a company you have a first sergeant,

235
00:14:24.08 --> 00:14:27.64
you know, in the NNCL ranks, you can sort of split at E8.

236
00:14:27.64 --> 00:14:30.72
You can either be a master sergeant or a first sergeant.

237
00:14:30.72 --> 00:14:34.20
And in a company traditionally, I have a first sergeant who sort of runs all the admin

238
00:14:34.20 --> 00:14:37.28
and all that then you have a master sergeant who's does ops, right?

239
00:14:37.28 --> 00:14:39.20
He's like the ops sergeant.

240
00:14:39.20 --> 00:14:43.84
And I remember my first ops sergeant, I mean, he had one eye from Vietnam and he was a literate.

241
00:14:43.84 --> 00:14:48.44
I mean, he would sign like a X on the duty roster and stuff like that.

242
00:14:48.44 --> 00:14:53.28
I was, you know, I mean, yeah, there was some, there was definitely a lot of Vietnam

243
00:14:53.28 --> 00:14:54.28
America is there.

244
00:14:54.28 --> 00:14:57.84
And how do you adapt?

245
00:14:57.84 --> 00:15:01.84
Candlely poorly at first, you know, I mean, when I got there, you know, I mean,

246
00:15:01.84 --> 00:15:05.44
it was shock and awe.

247
00:15:05.44 --> 00:15:09.24
And I, you know, I certainly didn't want to be there and for probably the first few weeks

248
00:15:09.24 --> 00:15:12.72
thought I had made a monumental error and judgment.

249
00:15:12.72 --> 00:15:18.44
But there was just enough in me that I felt like, hey, I'm, you know, I'm not going to

250
00:15:18.44 --> 00:15:21.68
go back to my family, hat and hand with my tail between my legs.

251
00:15:21.68 --> 00:15:24.72
So I just, you know, tried to do it day at a time.

252
00:15:24.72 --> 00:15:29.16
But I do remember, you know, the first morning they wake up, it's brutal, right, trash

253
00:15:29.16 --> 00:15:31.48
cans thrown over a poem, people out of bunks.

254
00:15:31.48 --> 00:15:34.32
And, you know, there was a lot of physical abuse back then.

255
00:15:34.32 --> 00:15:41.000
I mean, it was, you know, measured but seemed pretty violent to me.

256
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.48
But, you know, I remember laying in my rack every morning before, you know, because I could

257
00:15:45.48 --> 00:15:49.44
hear him moving around, like little mice, positioning themselves before they launch.

258
00:15:49.44 --> 00:15:51.48
They all out of salt.

259
00:15:51.48 --> 00:15:54.80
And, you know, I'd be laying there and I'd be like, well, what do I have to look for

260
00:15:54.80 --> 00:15:55.80
it today?

261
00:15:55.80 --> 00:15:58.20
Well, that would be nothing.

262
00:15:58.20 --> 00:16:02.48
So, once I got out of the rack and I started going, you're like, I'm muscle memory,

263
00:16:02.48 --> 00:16:04.64
I was fine, but those were the worst parts.

264
00:16:04.64 --> 00:16:08.76
Was that morning laying there, no one this onslaught that was going to, you know, start

265
00:16:08.76 --> 00:16:10.48
there in a couple minutes.

266
00:16:10.48 --> 00:16:14.20
But all that being said, you know, I mean, and I, and I think I was sort of a jackwagon

267
00:16:14.20 --> 00:16:18.68
for my first come as typical, you know, I did well in boot camp.

268
00:16:18.68 --> 00:16:22.12
I got whatever Maritoria's PFC, you know, all that.

269
00:16:22.12 --> 00:16:26.96
I think primarily because my drone was starting to was hot for my sister.

270
00:16:26.96 --> 00:16:30.92
But, you know, I could take any leg up, I could get.

271
00:16:30.92 --> 00:16:34.72
But, you know, the first couple years I did all this, I went to Luzune to Second

272
00:16:34.72 --> 00:16:38.84
Maridiv out there and I did all the stupid stuff that young troops did, you know,

273
00:16:38.84 --> 00:16:41.84
blow all my money for the first three days after payday.

274
00:16:41.84 --> 00:16:46.16
You know, thank God I had a meal card or I would have started to death.

275
00:16:46.16 --> 00:16:49.84
But then, you know, I went to Okinawa to Third Maridiv and that's when the sort of

276
00:16:49.84 --> 00:16:50.84
the light came on.

277
00:16:50.84 --> 00:16:51.84
I started going to school.

278
00:16:51.84 --> 00:16:54.92
I got my diploma and started going to college.

279
00:16:54.92 --> 00:16:57.92
And I mean, you know, and then once you get a little success, you know, you sort of

280
00:16:57.92 --> 00:17:02.96
build on that. I mean, they're setbacks along the way, but then I was like, OK, I can do this,

281
00:17:02.96 --> 00:17:04.68
you know, what was your MOS?

282
00:17:04.68 --> 00:17:07.60
I was an 1833 Amtraker.

283
00:17:07.60 --> 00:17:08.60
Get some.

284
00:17:08.60 --> 00:17:09.60
Yeah.

285
00:17:09.60 --> 00:17:16.40
When you, when you say, was there anything that made you realize, hey, I need to kind

286
00:17:16.40 --> 00:17:20.20
of step up my game, maybe I should start, you know, going to college, maybe I should

287
00:17:20.20 --> 00:17:23.16
start my continued education, maybe I should start trying to get events?

288
00:17:23.16 --> 00:17:26.88
Was there anything that, in particular, do you have a leader that mentored you?

289
00:17:26.88 --> 00:17:30.68
Did you just look around and say, man, why don't I do a little bit better?

290
00:17:30.68 --> 00:17:32.20
Well, do you remember what that was?

291
00:17:32.20 --> 00:17:33.20
Was it think one thing in particular?

292
00:17:33.20 --> 00:17:35.92
Yeah, it wasn't, you know, there wasn't a specific leader.

293
00:17:35.92 --> 00:17:41.76
There were later in my life certainly those that, you know, that really inspired me to go

294
00:17:41.76 --> 00:17:44.44
above and beyond.

295
00:17:44.44 --> 00:17:48.76
But at that stage, I think it was more seeing people crash and burn around me.

296
00:17:48.76 --> 00:17:53.08
You know, I mean, getting guys getting kicked out for drugs was ramping back down.

297
00:17:53.08 --> 00:17:54.52
I mean, it was really ramping.

298
00:17:54.52 --> 00:17:57.80
And, and guys were getting caught.

299
00:17:57.80 --> 00:18:00.08
We didn't do urine analysis or anything like that.

300
00:18:00.08 --> 00:18:03.68
I mean, it was physically caught with, you know, drugs and the barracks.

301
00:18:03.68 --> 00:18:07.12
And it was open bay, back then we were open bay barracks.

302
00:18:07.12 --> 00:18:11.08
It courthouse bay, which is where our, our batyne was.

303
00:18:11.08 --> 00:18:14.32
And I just saw these guys and I mean, I, I just saw them failing.

304
00:18:14.32 --> 00:18:16.68
And I mean, I knew they were on a downward spiral.

305
00:18:16.68 --> 00:18:20.56
And I think over time I saw enough of that, or I was like, okay, I don't want that to be

306
00:18:20.56 --> 00:18:21.56
me.

307
00:18:21.56 --> 00:18:28.12
And I went to a canal was sort of in, you know, my own personal mandate to, to turn my

308
00:18:28.12 --> 00:18:30.56
life around and, you know, make something of myself.

309
00:18:30.56 --> 00:18:34.40
Hey, you know, listen, it was never part of the training, on the training calendar for me

310
00:18:34.40 --> 00:18:35.72
to be a general officer.

311
00:18:35.72 --> 00:18:40.48
I remain amazed of the flaws and the promotion system of this day.

312
00:18:40.48 --> 00:18:45.68
But, you know, I just, I just, my goal was to be a sergeant frankly.

313
00:18:45.68 --> 00:18:47.04
That was my goal.

314
00:18:47.04 --> 00:18:52.000
And, you know, but, you know, you get a little victory and you sort of build on that.

315
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.96
And, you know, and then low and behold, here I am, you know, a flag flying and everything.

316
00:18:57.96 --> 00:19:02.04
So, you know, as you know, as a former aide, you know, yeah.

317
00:19:02.04 --> 00:19:03.04
Yeah.

318
00:19:03.04 --> 00:19:07.88
So, when you, when you, how do you originally hear, because you ended up going to the

319
00:19:07.88 --> 00:19:09.60
war in officer flight program right, right?

320
00:19:09.60 --> 00:19:10.60
Right.

321
00:19:10.60 --> 00:19:11.60
How did you originally hear about that?

322
00:19:11.60 --> 00:19:16.16
Well, I read when I was at the rock, Ocanawa, I re-enlisted.

323
00:19:16.16 --> 00:19:20.84
And I went, I got my duty station at choice or whatever and it was Marine barracks,

324
00:19:20.84 --> 00:19:25.20
woodbeal and Washington, which is now long since close.

325
00:19:25.20 --> 00:19:27.88
And I was working as a bouncer in the Globe and Anchor Club.

326
00:19:27.88 --> 00:19:31.80
You know, we had our own enlisted club at the corner of our barracks.

327
00:19:31.80 --> 00:19:37.60
And there was a reserve, a Marine reserve, hellow unit that was Huey unit that was on the

328
00:19:37.60 --> 00:19:39.08
base there.

329
00:19:39.08 --> 00:19:46.84
And some guy, Pixley Euricks was his name, was walking by with this brochure and had

330
00:19:46.84 --> 00:19:51.76
a cobra hover and over the trees and the morning this coming up and I'm like, hey, what's

331
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:52.76
that?

332
00:19:52.76 --> 00:19:55.28
And he said, hey, it's this army worn officer flight training.

333
00:19:55.28 --> 00:19:57.28
I mean, I barely knew what a worn officer was.

334
00:19:57.28 --> 00:20:00.72
I was like, you know, the Marine took memorizing the ranks and all that stuff.

335
00:20:00.72 --> 00:20:01.72
Very nice.

336
00:20:01.72 --> 00:20:03.60
I just recited him before he went to bed and boot camp.

337
00:20:03.60 --> 00:20:07.88
But, you know, and I said, don't you have to have a degree and I probably had, you

338
00:20:07.88 --> 00:20:10.72
know, I don't know, less than a year of college at that time.

339
00:20:10.72 --> 00:20:11.96
And he said, no.

340
00:20:11.96 --> 00:20:16.76
So I started, you know, I was like, hmm, so I took the brochure, he gave it to me.

341
00:20:16.76 --> 00:20:20.88
And we both ended up, you know, he ended up ultimately joining the code.

342
00:20:20.88 --> 00:20:26.84
He got into the Army worn officer program and then flew 58, you know, little scout helicopter.

343
00:20:26.84 --> 00:20:28.88
They ended up transferring into the Coast Guard.

344
00:20:28.88 --> 00:20:30.88
But I went through the process.

345
00:20:30.88 --> 00:20:34.56
I drove down to Fort Lewis and did my physical down there.

346
00:20:34.56 --> 00:20:36.76
It took all my flight out to Tudetus.

347
00:20:36.76 --> 00:20:40.08
And of course, right before I was getting ready to ship out for this, you know, the Marine

348
00:20:40.08 --> 00:20:41.08
Corps being the Marine Corps.

349
00:20:41.08 --> 00:20:45.76
They're like, hey, you've been back, you know, for 18 months from the rocks, we're going

350
00:20:45.76 --> 00:20:46.76
to send you back to the rocks.

351
00:20:46.76 --> 00:20:47.76
I was like perfect.

352
00:20:47.76 --> 00:20:52.96
You know, so the Army graciously delayed my entry into flight school for the 18 months.

353
00:20:52.96 --> 00:20:55.40
I went over there, did my time.

354
00:20:55.40 --> 00:20:59.40
You know, it came back from Okinawa to the Separation Center at Camp Pendleton.

355
00:20:59.40 --> 00:21:02.52
And then three days later, I was at Fort Rucker, Alabama.

356
00:21:02.52 --> 00:21:04.72
I didn't know anything about the Army.

357
00:21:04.72 --> 00:21:06.72
I mean, I had nothing.

358
00:21:06.72 --> 00:21:10.96
You know, and it showed, you know, I mean, like drill and ceremony and all that.

359
00:21:10.96 --> 00:21:15.08
So they do it, you know, not completely different, but definitely enough that I was dropped

360
00:21:15.08 --> 00:21:18.08
for pushups frequently and worn off Sir Canada School.

361
00:21:18.08 --> 00:21:21.84
But went through that opted for blackhawks.

362
00:21:21.84 --> 00:21:24.24
That was like sort of a new airplane back then.

363
00:21:24.24 --> 00:21:27.56
It wasn't brand new, but it was, you know, pretty hot rock to get on.

364
00:21:27.56 --> 00:21:30.16
And I went to the 101st.

365
00:21:30.16 --> 00:21:33.68
How many, when you were going through the flight training, how many pilots were getting

366
00:21:33.68 --> 00:21:35.36
trained at a time?

367
00:21:35.36 --> 00:21:37.56
We just had a Vietnam pilot on.

368
00:21:37.56 --> 00:21:41.80
And he said, you go out to take off in the morning to be like hundreds and hundreds of

369
00:21:41.80 --> 00:21:43.36
helicopters taken off in the morning.

370
00:21:43.36 --> 00:21:44.36
Oh, yeah.

371
00:21:44.36 --> 00:21:45.48
It wasn't as bad as Vietnam.

372
00:21:45.48 --> 00:21:47.44
I know the intensity wasn't there.

373
00:21:47.44 --> 00:21:52.92
But I think they graduated about 50 worn off Sir Palson.

374
00:21:52.92 --> 00:21:57.36
And there was a commission class that was, you know, sort of our, you know, they went along

375
00:21:57.36 --> 00:21:59.92
through with us.

376
00:21:59.92 --> 00:22:02.28
And we brought every two weeks.

377
00:22:02.28 --> 00:22:06.20
So they were pumping out helicopter policy crazy.

378
00:22:06.20 --> 00:22:08.20
And what did you fly as a training bird?

379
00:22:08.20 --> 00:22:14.60
Well, I started out in this airplane, the TH55 helicopter, which was the civilian designation.

380
00:22:14.60 --> 00:22:16.84
It was a Schweitzer 300.

381
00:22:16.84 --> 00:22:19.000
It was a resip, reciprocal engine.

382
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.64
I mean, it sounded like a freaking lawnmower.

383
00:22:20.64 --> 00:22:24.64
And I was like, you know, you said about hundreds of us, you know, we take off and we're

384
00:22:24.64 --> 00:22:25.64
all in a line.

385
00:22:25.64 --> 00:22:30.16
These orange helicopters and flying out to our stage fields and do our stuff.

386
00:22:30.16 --> 00:22:34.08
And then after we checked out on that, anime was a piece of crap.

387
00:22:34.08 --> 00:22:36.08
I mean, this thing was, I mean, it's max speed.

388
00:22:36.08 --> 00:22:39.20
It was like 50 miles an hour or something.

389
00:22:39.20 --> 00:22:44.12
I switched over to Huey's, went through the, you know, transition into that and they

390
00:22:44.12 --> 00:22:49.44
do all my instruments and combat training and, you know, tactical training and that.

391
00:22:49.44 --> 00:22:54.16
And then post flights go on, went into the Black Hawk aircraft call course.

392
00:22:54.16 --> 00:22:55.32
How much different is it flying there?

393
00:22:55.32 --> 00:22:58.40
Huey from flying a Black Hawk?

394
00:22:58.40 --> 00:22:59.40
Much different.

395
00:22:59.40 --> 00:23:03.04
The motor systems, you know, this is, you know, getting into tech, no key helicopter

396
00:23:03.04 --> 00:23:04.04
speak here.

397
00:23:04.04 --> 00:23:05.92
But, you know, the rotor systems different.

398
00:23:05.92 --> 00:23:09.04
It's a semi-rigin in the Huey and an articulated system in the black.

399
00:23:09.04 --> 00:23:13.44
So I mean, you can do a lot more in a Black Hawk, you know, maneuvering wise and you

400
00:23:13.44 --> 00:23:15.32
can do in a Huey.

401
00:23:15.32 --> 00:23:16.92
The Huey, I think I would put it.

402
00:23:16.92 --> 00:23:23.52
The Black Hawk is like a G5 in the civilian world jet, right?

403
00:23:23.52 --> 00:23:25.76
And the Huey's like a DC3.

404
00:23:25.76 --> 00:23:28.92
You know, so they're, you know, it's just their Vietnam or all these birds.

405
00:23:28.92 --> 00:23:30.56
You can see on the tail numbers.

406
00:23:30.56 --> 00:23:35.000
There were 68, 69, vintage.

407
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
But I still like it.

408
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
I got about 350 hours and those things.

409
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.84
I got about 160 in flight school and then a Black Hawk's are grounded for a mechanical

410
00:23:42.84 --> 00:23:43.84
issue.

411
00:23:43.84 --> 00:23:47.44
So I flew, met a VAC around, called in a, you know, call flat iron aircraft.

412
00:23:47.44 --> 00:23:49.000
So I got a lot of time in Huey.

413
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
So I'm not a lot.

414
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
That, you know, pretty good time.

415
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
We had a top, we had a top, got it found.

416
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.64
The guy had started top gun was on here.

417
00:23:54.64 --> 00:23:55.64
Oh, no.

418
00:23:55.64 --> 00:24:02.40
Those guys were, would just get into random aircraft and just take off in jets by themselves

419
00:24:02.40 --> 00:24:04.40
that they'd never flown before.

420
00:24:04.40 --> 00:24:10.48
You know, like, including they had captured a Soviet make and they'd go out in, it was

421
00:24:10.48 --> 00:24:15.20
in like out in Arizona somewhere and they'd fly out there and they'd get in that thing

422
00:24:15.20 --> 00:24:17.16
and fly that thing.

423
00:24:17.16 --> 00:24:19.96
Is it, is it that transferable with helicopters?

424
00:24:19.96 --> 00:24:25.32
Yeah, I would say, I mean, each airplane's got its own unique handling characteristics,

425
00:24:25.32 --> 00:24:31.64
helicopter, but, you know, the hard part is starting it for me, like, okay, because you

426
00:24:31.64 --> 00:24:36.48
don't sum, you got to modulate the throttle and give gas into the turbine to get it going

427
00:24:36.48 --> 00:24:37.48
and summing up.

428
00:24:37.48 --> 00:24:41.84
I mean, so if somebody else starts it or walks me throughout a start it, I mean,

429
00:24:41.84 --> 00:24:44.20
I can, you know, you just sort of react to the plane.

430
00:24:44.20 --> 00:24:49.36
You know, I mean, you see what it's doing and you do the counter action or, you know, what

431
00:24:49.36 --> 00:24:50.52
you got to do in the control.

432
00:24:50.52 --> 00:24:53.96
So the stick and rudder stuff, I think, is pretty transferable.

433
00:24:53.96 --> 00:24:58.52
I mean, I hopped in a jet-long range or, I don't know, about a year ago and I had flown

434
00:24:58.52 --> 00:25:03.90
in, you know, I don't know, five, six, seven, eight years and it was no problem because he

435
00:25:03.90 --> 00:25:05.14
had to start it for me.

436
00:25:05.14 --> 00:25:10.04
You know, but, and I wouldn't get into a, like, flying instruments in it or anything

437
00:25:10.04 --> 00:25:15.44
like that, you lose more of the procedural stuff, like, you know, all instruments is, you

438
00:25:15.44 --> 00:25:16.68
know, flying into clouds.

439
00:25:16.68 --> 00:25:19.72
There's a lot of procedure and things and you got to stay up on that.

440
00:25:19.72 --> 00:25:23.64
There's a lot of book works, so you understand what's happening and what your, what your

441
00:25:23.64 --> 00:25:27.16
responsibilities are like that and those atrophied for me.

442
00:25:27.16 --> 00:25:31.44
But as far as wiggle in the sticks, yeah, I could hop in a helicopter.

443
00:25:31.44 --> 00:25:32.44
Oh, frankly.

444
00:25:32.44 --> 00:25:35.28
Was it hard, was there, did you have any trouble going through, was there a big attrition

445
00:25:35.28 --> 00:25:36.28
rate?

446
00:25:36.28 --> 00:25:37.60
Did you have any trouble with anything?

447
00:25:37.60 --> 00:25:39.80
Uh, not really.

448
00:25:39.80 --> 00:25:43.000
I, um, instruments was pretty challenging.

449
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.68
You know, you start in a Huey simulator, which is, you know, um, which was, you know,

450
00:25:48.68 --> 00:25:52.12
doing climbing descending turns with not, not no outside reference.

451
00:25:52.12 --> 00:25:55.000
You know, you rely on your visual sense, right?

452
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.04
So seeing and the horizon and all that way, of course, you don't have any of that in

453
00:25:59.04 --> 00:26:00.04
the clouds.

454
00:26:00.04 --> 00:26:02.76
So they train you on how to, you know, get into instruments.

455
00:26:02.76 --> 00:26:06.04
So that was, that was challenging.

456
00:26:06.04 --> 00:26:07.04
A quick story.

457
00:26:07.04 --> 00:26:11.48
I was flying in the Huey simulator and it's just giant, like, warehouse, full of simulators,

458
00:26:11.48 --> 00:26:14.80
like this, they don't, you know, they're really basic.

459
00:26:14.80 --> 00:26:19.24
And I'm late at night getting some extra flight time in there and the simulator operator

460
00:26:19.24 --> 00:26:22.36
comes over to rate because he's your air traffic control or guy too, right?

461
00:26:22.36 --> 00:26:27.24
He's sort of your, you know, and I, you know, made some radio call and you said, uh, Roger,

462
00:26:27.24 --> 00:26:29.36
Huey 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

463
00:26:29.36 --> 00:26:33.56
You got a flight of geese, uh, your altitude going opposite direction.

464
00:26:33.56 --> 00:26:36.92
And I'm like, you know, looking at this dude, I'll fly with him like with the hills,

465
00:26:36.92 --> 00:26:38.56
this dude talking about.

466
00:26:38.56 --> 00:26:43.20
Next thing I know, this guy's got a mop and he's slapping it on a windscreen, like,

467
00:26:43.20 --> 00:26:44.88
geese, you know, there's green.

468
00:26:44.88 --> 00:26:47.64
I was like, little slow out there tonight, bro.

469
00:26:47.64 --> 00:26:51.84
You know, but yeah, I mean, that was a little challenging.

470
00:26:51.84 --> 00:26:54.88
It like me, I think with me, when everybody else would say the same thing.

471
00:26:55.88 --> 00:27:01.48
But no, I mean, now going into special ops and meet no standards in the one 60th

472
00:27:01.48 --> 00:27:06.72
for, you know, plus or minus 30 seconds and all that, there was some, there was definitely

473
00:27:06.72 --> 00:27:08.96
some stress there, you know.

474
00:27:08.96 --> 00:27:13.60
So you get done with flight school and then that's when you went to the hundred first.

475
00:27:13.60 --> 00:27:21.28
Yep, I was flying Medevac for Delta 326 Med, uh, three 26 Medvetainin and I was flying

476
00:27:21.28 --> 00:27:23.12
her ambulance stuff there.

477
00:27:23.12 --> 00:27:28.06
When I actually, when I got out of flight squad orders to Germany to a place called Schwabish

478
00:27:28.06 --> 00:27:31.44
Hall, because one third of the army back then was in Germany.

479
00:27:31.44 --> 00:27:32.44
I never realized that.

480
00:27:32.44 --> 00:27:33.44
I mean, that's pretty significant.

481
00:27:33.44 --> 00:27:37.60
That was the investment we had in the Cold War.

482
00:27:37.60 --> 00:27:41.92
But I heard about this secret unit, you know, uh, in Fort Campbell.

483
00:27:41.92 --> 00:27:44.12
And I was like, hey, that's what I want to do.

484
00:27:44.12 --> 00:27:45.12
I went out on what they do.

485
00:27:45.12 --> 00:27:48.32
I probably ain't good enough, but that's what I want to shoot for.

486
00:27:48.32 --> 00:27:54.16
So I swapped with a guy who wanted to go to Germany and I went to Fort Campbell and with

487
00:27:54.16 --> 00:27:58.12
that a month, you know, when I was in the hundred first, I walked over the recruiter.

488
00:27:58.12 --> 00:28:01.92
The back then, the one 60 didn't have any, they didn't wear patches, anything.

489
00:28:01.92 --> 00:28:06.84
There was just, you know, all there's, there was no signs in front of their buildings.

490
00:28:06.84 --> 00:28:08.16
And I said, hey, I want to join the unit.

491
00:28:08.16 --> 00:28:13.16
And I was like, what we call a wobbly one, you know, a war and officer one junior grade.

492
00:28:13.16 --> 00:28:14.16
And they laughed at me.

493
00:28:14.16 --> 00:28:18.12
And I went back every month and said, hey, I'm, you know, they told me what I had to

494
00:28:18.12 --> 00:28:22.24
do and, you know, make pilot and command and get a lot of night vision goggle time.

495
00:28:22.24 --> 00:28:24.52
So I was doing my best to do all those things.

496
00:28:24.52 --> 00:28:31.28
And, you know, I kept, you know, telling them I'm interested, you know, persistence.

497
00:28:31.28 --> 00:28:36.04
And then I made it, you know, I didn't realize the difference in you, you, you know, in

498
00:28:36.04 --> 00:28:37.96
your job in the seals, it was a little different.

499
00:28:37.96 --> 00:28:40.44
But a warrant is a technician, as you know, right?

500
00:28:40.44 --> 00:28:45.16
So our warrants in the 160th will stay in the cockpit and flying the same missions, what

501
00:28:45.16 --> 00:28:49.88
that's a little birds or 60s or 47s for 20 years.

502
00:28:49.88 --> 00:28:50.88
And I loved flying.

503
00:28:50.88 --> 00:28:51.88
I still loved flying.

504
00:28:51.88 --> 00:28:57.08
But I also missed the leadership side of that, you know, being an NCO and from your

505
00:28:57.08 --> 00:28:58.08
Marine Corps days.

506
00:28:58.08 --> 00:28:59.08
Right.

507
00:28:59.08 --> 00:29:00.08
Yeah.

508
00:29:00.08 --> 00:29:02.72
And, you know, there's none of, I mean, there is some of that in war and officer ranks.

509
00:29:02.72 --> 00:29:06.88
But it's not their main focus right by design.

510
00:29:06.88 --> 00:29:10.16
So I decided to go to officer candidate school.

511
00:29:10.16 --> 00:29:14.28
And, and so, you know, I went to officer candidate school.

512
00:29:14.28 --> 00:29:15.60
So you had to apply for that?

513
00:29:15.60 --> 00:29:16.60
Yeah, I applied.

514
00:29:16.60 --> 00:29:18.28
I had been going to college still.

515
00:29:18.28 --> 00:29:22.20
So I had to have, you know, two years of college to apply for OCS.

516
00:29:22.20 --> 00:29:26.48
And then you had to have your four year degree by the time you made O3.

517
00:29:26.48 --> 00:29:28.96
So I applied and got picked up.

518
00:29:28.96 --> 00:29:29.96
But it was funny.

519
00:29:29.96 --> 00:29:33.80
I mean, I mean, you have to be had to be commissioned, you probably remember this, by the

520
00:29:33.80 --> 00:29:37.92
beginning of your 10th year or so, because you had to be able to do 10 years of commission

521
00:29:37.92 --> 00:29:41.56
time was what you needed to do to retire by 20.

522
00:29:41.56 --> 00:29:45.80
I graduated OCS with nine years, 10 months and two weeks.

523
00:29:45.80 --> 00:29:49.28
Like if I went, I got a hang mail or something, I got set back.

524
00:29:49.28 --> 00:29:51.20
I went to film out, you know.

525
00:29:51.20 --> 00:29:52.96
And I was a W2 when I was a W2.

526
00:29:52.96 --> 00:29:54.96
Did you go to full normal OCS?

527
00:29:54.96 --> 00:29:59.04
Oh, yeah, listen, I got the distinction to have on my head shaved more than anybody else.

528
00:29:59.04 --> 00:30:00.04
I know.

529
00:30:00.04 --> 00:30:03.08
No, you're getting a doctorate on a regular basis.

530
00:30:03.08 --> 00:30:07.04
I'm like the high water bar for you guys on hair over here, which is not say it much

531
00:30:07.04 --> 00:30:08.04
by the way.

532
00:30:08.04 --> 00:30:13.60
But yeah, you, so you've been through multitude of fresh and doctrinations.

533
00:30:13.60 --> 00:30:15.40
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

534
00:30:15.40 --> 00:30:16.40
So how was that?

535
00:30:16.40 --> 00:30:17.40
How did they treat you at OCS?

536
00:30:17.40 --> 00:30:18.64
Oh, like, where is this now?

537
00:30:18.64 --> 00:30:24.16
So I started in July of 87, graduated October 16th.

538
00:30:24.16 --> 00:30:27.36
I think of 87 commissioned on that day.

539
00:30:27.36 --> 00:30:33.88
So I was technically your group 88 because I was after the first of the fiscal year.

540
00:30:33.88 --> 00:30:36.04
I thought the curriculum at the course was pretty good.

541
00:30:36.04 --> 00:30:40.32
We spent about between a third and a half of our time in the field.

542
00:30:40.32 --> 00:30:44.96
So we're doing, you know, it's really infantry oriented, anti-armory, ambitious, and rough

543
00:30:44.96 --> 00:30:49.52
marches and things like that, which I thought was really good.

544
00:30:49.52 --> 00:30:54.12
I would say, you know, the cadre at the time and it could be different.

545
00:30:54.12 --> 00:30:59.92
And I'm in the OCS Hall of Fame, so they made, you know, disown me over this.

546
00:30:59.92 --> 00:31:02.44
But the cadre were not great.

547
00:31:02.44 --> 00:31:06.50
I mean, they were guy, you know, we had a couple guys, I think, that it got DUIs and

548
00:31:06.50 --> 00:31:08.28
got sort of stuck over there, you know.

549
00:31:08.28 --> 00:31:13.24
So it wasn't, they weren't like a great examples of stellar leadership in my mind.

550
00:31:13.24 --> 00:31:14.88
I thought the curriculum was really good.

551
00:31:14.88 --> 00:31:20.08
I thought the quality of the officers that were mentoring us were not.

552
00:31:20.08 --> 00:31:24.84
And, you know, a lot of the most of the OCS people who go through any army are those

553
00:31:24.84 --> 00:31:30.76
that have gotten a degree and decide after their outside the window for ROTC to go into

554
00:31:30.76 --> 00:31:31.76
military.

555
00:31:31.76 --> 00:31:35.44
So they got to go to basic and then they go to OCS.

556
00:31:35.44 --> 00:31:39.56
So we had a bunch of, we had masters, we had a couple of PhDs, I think, in there.

557
00:31:39.56 --> 00:31:42.12
But I mean, they didn't, you know, they didn't know shit from China.

558
00:31:42.12 --> 00:31:44.24
I mean, they didn't know, you know.

559
00:31:44.24 --> 00:31:45.24
How's that?

560
00:31:45.24 --> 00:31:46.24
P-H-D-T-T.

561
00:31:46.24 --> 00:31:47.24
Yeah, exactly.

562
00:31:47.24 --> 00:31:52.20
The moral percentage of us that were former, you know, prior service, you know, and they

563
00:31:52.20 --> 00:31:54.72
sort of carry the class and do a lot of mentoring.

564
00:31:54.72 --> 00:31:56.20
There was three warrants in our class.

565
00:31:56.20 --> 00:31:59.88
We had about 240, 250 people in our class.

566
00:31:59.88 --> 00:32:04.52
So again, good experience.

567
00:32:04.52 --> 00:32:07.84
You know, I learned a lot.

568
00:32:07.84 --> 00:32:11.96
I think, for instance, some Marine Corps does a much better job in investing in their training

569
00:32:11.96 --> 00:32:13.24
base than the army does.

570
00:32:13.24 --> 00:32:17.16
I mean, I think that's changing now.

571
00:32:17.16 --> 00:32:22.16
But historically, you know, the Marine Corps puts their best and brightest to develop those

572
00:32:22.16 --> 00:32:26.76
young troops and officers.

573
00:32:26.76 --> 00:32:30.80
The army really, they're more focused on their tactical units, which I think is at the

574
00:32:30.80 --> 00:32:32.80
expense of their future.

575
00:32:32.80 --> 00:32:35.44
Being my personal opinion.

576
00:32:35.44 --> 00:32:39.36
Well, when I went to OCS, you're candidate school, it's run by Marine Corps, Jones

577
00:32:39.36 --> 00:32:40.36
Schrofters.

578
00:32:40.36 --> 00:32:41.36
Did you go to Rhode Island?

579
00:32:41.36 --> 00:32:42.72
No, I went down to Pensacola.

580
00:32:42.72 --> 00:32:43.72
Okay.

581
00:32:43.72 --> 00:32:44.72
And they're just freaking outstanding.

582
00:32:44.72 --> 00:32:48.000
I mean, they're just like exactly what you'd expect.

583
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.32
They're just outstanding professionals across the board.

584
00:32:50.32 --> 00:32:51.32
Yeah.

585
00:32:51.32 --> 00:32:52.32
That was my experience.

586
00:32:52.32 --> 00:32:54.80
I mean, my DIs were really, really sharp.

587
00:32:54.80 --> 00:32:59.36
I mean, a little twisted, but, you know, little sadism thrown in there.

588
00:32:59.36 --> 00:33:01.96
But, you know, they were very square away.

589
00:33:01.96 --> 00:33:04.44
Setic, great example for us.

590
00:33:04.44 --> 00:33:09.64
So did you, so had you already gone to the one 60th at this point?

591
00:33:09.64 --> 00:33:10.64
So I was funny.

592
00:33:10.64 --> 00:33:11.64
I had graduate.

593
00:33:11.64 --> 00:33:12.64
I was getting ready to graduate.

594
00:33:12.64 --> 00:33:13.64
OCS.

595
00:33:13.64 --> 00:33:14.64
I have my packet in, right?

596
00:33:14.64 --> 00:33:18.16
I've been over there all those times as a warrant.

597
00:33:18.16 --> 00:33:21.96
And I called the recruiter a right before I was getting ready to graduate.

598
00:33:21.96 --> 00:33:27.56
And I was ordered to go to the 80 second and fly for the 80 second.

599
00:33:27.56 --> 00:33:28.88
And I graduated pretty high.

600
00:33:28.88 --> 00:33:33.24
I wasn't the number one, but I was like to know what's the Hall of Fame all about?

601
00:33:33.24 --> 00:33:39.16
Well, if you, you know, listen, if you make it past Colonel in OCS, they like, they'll

602
00:33:39.16 --> 00:33:42.28
the foot of the guy say, hey, do you want to be in OCS Hall of Fame?

603
00:33:42.28 --> 00:33:45.04
I was like, sure, I never went to the little ceremony, right?

604
00:33:45.04 --> 00:33:51.32
But they said, okay, send us 250 bucks so we can do your Piggas and that's a great deal.

605
00:33:51.32 --> 00:33:55.76
And so, somewhere in some hall over there for betting my pictures up on a wall a little

606
00:33:55.76 --> 00:33:57.000
bio, but I've never seen it.

607
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.40
Well, at 250 bucks a pop, you might be, yeah, I was like, a lot of company.

608
00:34:01.40 --> 00:34:02.40
Yeah.

609
00:34:02.40 --> 00:34:05.40
I was like, seriously, you guys are going to charge me to put me in the hall?

610
00:34:05.40 --> 00:34:06.80
I was like, typical, right?

611
00:34:06.80 --> 00:34:10.92
I'm sure, if you wait for the day, be all of OCS, all of a, it's probably very similar.

612
00:34:10.92 --> 00:34:16.40
Anyway, I was getting ready to graduate and, and I thought, you know what, I'm just going

613
00:34:16.40 --> 00:34:18.52
to call this the recruiter.

614
00:34:18.52 --> 00:34:23.64
Because you have to go through a week long assessment process just to get accepted, conditionally

615
00:34:23.64 --> 00:34:28.48
into the, you know, check rides, some physical standard stuff.

616
00:34:28.48 --> 00:34:32.52
And I talked to this guy and he said, and I was, you know, going to be a second lieutenant.

617
00:34:32.52 --> 00:34:37.04
They only took guys that were had previous flight experience, you know, so you had to

618
00:34:37.04 --> 00:34:38.20
get one or two tours.

619
00:34:38.20 --> 00:34:44.96
But because I had flown as a warrant, I had about, you know, 750 hours and I had approaching

620
00:34:44.96 --> 00:34:50.88
100 NVG hours at the time, which was pretty good for back then, right?

621
00:34:50.88 --> 00:34:54.60
NVGs, you know, now, you know, that wouldn't even, you know, raise an eyebrow.

622
00:34:54.60 --> 00:34:56.88
The back then it was okay.

623
00:34:56.88 --> 00:35:02.12
So they agreed to put me through the assessment, which pissed my assignment off, so

624
00:35:02.12 --> 00:35:04.20
off, because that was how my way to the 80s second.

625
00:35:04.20 --> 00:35:08.96
And they told me going, hey, look, we don't take the tenants, but, you know, you do really

626
00:35:08.96 --> 00:35:11.44
well, and maybe we'll bring you back.

627
00:35:11.44 --> 00:35:15.84
So I went, I sort of approached it with, well, I'm going to give it my all and, you know,

628
00:35:15.84 --> 00:35:17.32
they took me.

629
00:35:17.32 --> 00:35:18.96
So I went there as a second lieutenant.

630
00:35:18.96 --> 00:35:23.12
They made me go into headquarters for a while to learn out of, you know, collect for, you

631
00:35:23.12 --> 00:35:27.36
know, Army emergency relief and do all that kind of crap that you have to do as a young

632
00:35:27.36 --> 00:35:33.64
fellow, and then I went to a platoon, and I ended up being the first adaption leader, the

633
00:35:33.64 --> 00:35:37.36
attacks, 60s, and he probably saw those, and I rack several times.

634
00:35:37.36 --> 00:35:42.28
You know, I had a great platoon, Mike Durant, Cliff Walkot, it was killed in Somalia,

635
00:35:42.28 --> 00:35:43.28
October.

636
00:35:43.28 --> 00:35:46.60
In fact, my middle son had just graduated college a couple of weeks ago as Mitchell

637
00:35:46.60 --> 00:35:51.44
Walkot, Hupmacher, and Donovan Brieley's copa, they were killed in super-61.

638
00:35:51.44 --> 00:35:56.60
So I had a great platoon, went to Panama together, I went to the golf line off the

639
00:35:56.60 --> 00:35:58.52
Kirk, Bart Herk, and Lee's.

640
00:35:58.52 --> 00:36:01.60
So what was going on, and that's what happened first, that was your first.

641
00:36:01.60 --> 00:36:06.16
Right, yeah, I was like big time, you know, I mean we flew into Bob Rayne.

642
00:36:06.16 --> 00:36:08.04
So this is what, like 87.

643
00:36:08.04 --> 00:36:13.84
80, I got there, I did my, yeah, I got there, actually I got to the unit, because I

644
00:36:13.84 --> 00:36:16.84
went through airborne school and did all that stuff at Benning.

645
00:36:16.84 --> 00:36:22.36
I got there around February of 88, and I did my first tour over there is like, there

646
00:36:22.36 --> 00:36:28.08
was a logistics cell at the ASU Bahrain, and so I did that, and then when I went through

647
00:36:28.08 --> 00:36:33.76
my training and got checked out as an MH60 pilot, I went back over into two more tours.

648
00:36:33.76 --> 00:36:41.88
We fly into Bahrain, and the outgoing crew would fly off the barge, park it on the ramp,

649
00:36:41.88 --> 00:36:44.32
and we basically swapped that with him.

650
00:36:44.32 --> 00:36:47.80
Like we get there combat vs, they gave us their knee board packets, you know, we've been

651
00:36:47.80 --> 00:36:52.56
on this freaking rotator from hell for like two days, you know, stopping everywhere,

652
00:36:52.56 --> 00:36:55.24
a second hour, all those places.

653
00:36:55.24 --> 00:36:59.24
And we'd hop into airplane, and they'd get on the commercial flight going out, we'd

654
00:36:59.24 --> 00:37:04.000
hop on those helicopters and fly back out to the barge, and start missions the next

655
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
night.

656
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.04
When you talked about the training, like, so once you got to the 160, how many hours

657
00:37:10.04 --> 00:37:13.12
are you putting in, what kind of stress are they put, what are they doing to you to get

658
00:37:13.12 --> 00:37:14.12
you up to speed?

659
00:37:14.12 --> 00:37:15.32
How long does it take?

660
00:37:15.32 --> 00:37:22.56
Well, it's different now than it was then, but we had a, I think it's a three week,

661
00:37:22.56 --> 00:37:27.36
three week for the O's, the officers and warnafzers, ground phase training.

662
00:37:27.36 --> 00:37:34.16
So it's rock marches, you know, grappling, you know, all those kind of things shooting,

663
00:37:34.16 --> 00:37:39.52
we were carrying MP5s, which we ditched after Somalia.

664
00:37:39.52 --> 00:37:44.40
And so we do a lot of that shooting, and then we go into our, you know, we sort of split

665
00:37:44.40 --> 00:37:45.80
apart the officers do.

666
00:37:45.80 --> 00:37:50.72
And so you're either a little bird driver, you're a 60 driver, you're a 47, and then

667
00:37:50.72 --> 00:37:56.36
you go through that, you know, and you go through what we call a basic nav phase.

668
00:37:56.36 --> 00:38:01.80
And it's basically every night you go out, you got to compass and a clock and a map.

669
00:38:01.80 --> 00:38:07.52
You have no, you know, there's no GPS, no INS, no nothing.

670
00:38:07.52 --> 00:38:11.40
And they still do it to this way, this way, to this day.

671
00:38:11.40 --> 00:38:14.28
And you're expected to hit targets plus or minus 30 seconds.

672
00:38:14.28 --> 00:38:18.60
And then you take a check right and then you get all the bells and whistles and learn

673
00:38:18.60 --> 00:38:25.40
all the systems and how to air refuel and gunnery and all those kind of things.

674
00:38:25.40 --> 00:38:27.48
And they, you know, they're still very true to that.

675
00:38:27.48 --> 00:38:31.72
If we tell you we're going to be there, plus or minus 30 seconds, we're going to be there.

676
00:38:31.72 --> 00:38:34.52
And, you know, once we put you in, we're always going to come get you out.

677
00:38:34.52 --> 00:38:35.84
That I used to tell guys that all the time.

678
00:38:35.84 --> 00:38:39.000
Hey, we put you in, we're coming for you, man, doesn't matter.

679
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.20
You know, whatever it takes, we're going to come get you.

680
00:38:41.20 --> 00:38:45.80
Which I think is unique, I'm not saying that other folks aren't dedicated, but that's

681
00:38:45.80 --> 00:38:46.80
all we do, right?

682
00:38:46.80 --> 00:38:48.000
It's completely dedicated.

683
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
We don't care if it's a seal, a ranger, green beret, marsawk, radar, a f-sawks,

684
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.92
special tactics guy, we don't care.

685
00:38:55.92 --> 00:38:59.68
If you're on the ground, you know, you're our customer and we're going to do whatever

686
00:38:59.68 --> 00:39:00.68
it takes.

687
00:39:00.68 --> 00:39:02.68
So, the training really infuses that.

688
00:39:02.68 --> 00:39:04.28
And I mean, I was taught a young age.

689
00:39:04.28 --> 00:39:06.000
Hey, they're the customer.

690
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.20
We do whatever it takes to support them.

691
00:39:08.20 --> 00:39:11.40
And that really is their ethos in the whole unit.

692
00:39:11.40 --> 00:39:18.36
How much is your level of flying improve in that first, like six months that you're there?

693
00:39:18.36 --> 00:39:20.92
Well, you know, it's sort of an eat probably found out.

694
00:39:20.92 --> 00:39:25.72
I think like when you go into that unit, the unit's operating up here, right, and you're

695
00:39:25.72 --> 00:39:27.36
down here.

696
00:39:27.36 --> 00:39:28.72
And it really is, sink or swim.

697
00:39:28.72 --> 00:39:33.000
You either come up here or your history, you know?

698
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.72
And that's true across the soft community, the special ops community.

699
00:39:36.72 --> 00:39:41.12
So I mean, I improved, you know, significantly.

700
00:39:41.12 --> 00:39:42.84
I didn't really realize it, right?

701
00:39:42.84 --> 00:39:46.08
Because it's like when you're in a midst of it, I mean, you know, it's like leaving the

702
00:39:46.08 --> 00:39:50.52
seal team and getting in charge of a recruiting battalion or recruiting squadron or whatever

703
00:39:50.52 --> 00:39:51.52
they have in the Navy.

704
00:39:51.52 --> 00:39:55.64
You're like, okay, I can't just send him a ton of things, you know?

705
00:39:55.64 --> 00:39:56.64
Is the same thing.

706
00:39:56.64 --> 00:40:00.12
When you're in it, and remember, I came there as a second lieutenant.

707
00:40:00.12 --> 00:40:03.76
My first two were outside of soft.

708
00:40:03.76 --> 00:40:05.76
Was as an O5.

709
00:40:05.76 --> 00:40:08.60
So I did, so much of time in the one point years or something.

710
00:40:08.60 --> 00:40:09.80
Yeah, close to it.

711
00:40:09.80 --> 00:40:16.000
I mean, I went to Air Force Special Ops Command as an exchange pilot.

712
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.76
So after Desert Storm, Downing, wanted to sort of bring us together.

713
00:40:19.76 --> 00:40:25.24
You remember, remember, the MH53 Pavelos and the Air Force in the 160th, I mean, that was

714
00:40:25.24 --> 00:40:27.76
not a harmonious relationship back then.

715
00:40:27.76 --> 00:40:33.32
So, you know, into his credit general Downing in General Holland said, hey, we need to

716
00:40:33.32 --> 00:40:38.16
amend defense. So I went to Hurlberg and flew and then they sent a guy up.

717
00:40:38.16 --> 00:40:41.16
And I flew there from 92 to 96.

718
00:40:41.16 --> 00:40:42.96
It was an instructor pilot.

719
00:40:42.96 --> 00:40:43.96
I met my wife there.

720
00:40:43.96 --> 00:40:47.32
She was a squadron until dude.

721
00:40:47.32 --> 00:40:50.72
So my version is, you know, she latched onto the first Army guy.

722
00:40:50.72 --> 00:40:53.52
She has a slightly different version of that.

723
00:40:53.52 --> 00:40:57.40
But basically the Army remains a subordinate service to the Air Force and my own house

724
00:40:57.40 --> 00:40:58.40
to this day.

725
00:40:58.40 --> 00:40:59.40
Yeah.

726
00:40:59.40 --> 00:41:02.80
So you, so let's go back a little bit.

727
00:41:02.80 --> 00:41:05.56
Um, let's go back to Panama.

728
00:41:05.56 --> 00:41:07.96
So you're, so you're a platoon commander.

729
00:41:07.96 --> 00:41:08.96
So what does that mean?

730
00:41:08.96 --> 00:41:10.96
How many birds do you have when you're a platoon commander?

731
00:41:10.96 --> 00:41:15.36
Uh, eight, six, eight, something like that.

732
00:41:15.36 --> 00:41:19.80
I had less because the DAP, the Direct Action penetrator, the Defense of Arm penetrator

733
00:41:19.80 --> 00:41:24.20
depend on when you, what you call it.

734
00:41:24.20 --> 00:41:27.20
We were brand new.

735
00:41:27.20 --> 00:41:28.56
But you know, that was big time.

736
00:41:28.56 --> 00:41:30.12
And I mean, we went down there.

737
00:41:30.12 --> 00:41:37.28
I had, uh, I had, we had two armed birds, Cliff wall cotton, I were flying together.

738
00:41:37.28 --> 00:41:38.28
And, uh, was funny.

739
00:41:38.28 --> 00:41:43.08
We got down there and they had a patchy from the 80s second down there, not with us, but,

740
00:41:43.08 --> 00:41:44.80
you know, doing their stuff.

741
00:41:44.80 --> 00:41:47.24
And they wouldn't, uh, our commander at the time.

742
00:41:47.24 --> 00:41:51.04
For probably good reasons, and what good reasons to me is an old one or two.

743
00:41:51.04 --> 00:41:53.56
But he said, hey, you're not going to do a tack.

744
00:41:53.56 --> 00:41:55.32
I need you to do a saw.

745
00:41:55.32 --> 00:42:01.16
So the age six guys who, you know, out of general principle despise the DAP guys said,

746
00:42:01.16 --> 00:42:03.72
hey, DAP, what does that stand for?

747
00:42:03.72 --> 00:42:06.80
Didn't actually participate or didn't attack Panama.

748
00:42:06.80 --> 00:42:07.80
You picked.

749
00:42:07.80 --> 00:42:08.80
I don't like you.

750
00:42:08.80 --> 00:42:09.80
Pastor, you know.

751
00:42:09.80 --> 00:42:10.80
So I mean, I laughed about it.

752
00:42:10.80 --> 00:42:11.80
I was very funny.

753
00:42:11.80 --> 00:42:13.32
But yeah, when down there, it was awesome.

754
00:42:13.32 --> 00:42:19.08
We rolled off a C5, you know, I got in there about two and a half, or noon, and we started

755
00:42:19.08 --> 00:42:20.56
banging targets that night.

756
00:42:20.56 --> 00:42:21.56
Zero one was HR.

757
00:42:21.56 --> 00:42:26.12
They moved it up on the rescue of Curt Meus, and it was cool.

758
00:42:26.12 --> 00:42:28.64
I was assigned to a seal element.

759
00:42:28.64 --> 00:42:32.12
We were going to put seals around the Cuban and Nicaragua and embassies.

760
00:42:32.12 --> 00:42:36.44
They thought that, uh, Norway, I get my sport in there, you know, who ever thought it

761
00:42:36.44 --> 00:42:41.20
went into the Catholic, you know, the papalan, and then see if we got sick, you know.

762
00:42:41.20 --> 00:42:46.88
But, uh, yeah, we were, uh, we were sitting in hangar three at Howard Air Force Base.

763
00:42:46.88 --> 00:42:51.28
And, uh, it was pretty exciting here at AC 130 Thumpen targets and law common down.

764
00:42:51.28 --> 00:42:57.20
I see what they're 105 and it one point, somebody ran into the hangar and there was like,

765
00:42:57.20 --> 00:43:00.04
you know, I don't know, I want to say a thousand.

766
00:43:00.04 --> 00:43:02.56
I was like, caught sitting in there.

767
00:43:02.56 --> 00:43:06.44
Somebody said, hey, they're breaching the front gate of Howard and they shut all the lights

768
00:43:06.44 --> 00:43:07.44
off.

769
00:43:07.44 --> 00:43:11.76
And, you should, uh, charge an ounce going over where and I was sitting next to Walcott and

770
00:43:11.76 --> 00:43:14.000
I'm like, no balls to stay.

771
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.76
Die Gringo, jump up in the L.A.

772
00:43:15.76 --> 00:43:22.76
You're dark.

773
00:43:22.76 --> 00:43:27.24
I mean, how long were you flying ops for then in Panama?

774
00:43:27.24 --> 00:43:28.24
It was pretty quick.

775
00:43:28.24 --> 00:43:32.48
Yeah, I mean, you know, the real, I mean, I, we flew several night assaults of course

776
00:43:32.48 --> 00:43:37.88
that was a hunt for Elvis looking for Norway, I get for those first, uh, few weeks, or

777
00:43:37.88 --> 00:43:39.52
first week, I guess.

778
00:43:39.52 --> 00:43:45.08
Um, you know, but really major combat ops were, uh, were over pretty quick.

779
00:43:45.08 --> 00:43:51.20
And then they had, you know, then we started doing some, you know, sort of policing stuff.

780
00:43:51.20 --> 00:43:55.32
Um, remember the dignity of Italians, they called it, we called them the ding bats.

781
00:43:55.32 --> 00:43:59.28
That was Norway, I guess, sort of thugs that would, you know, we're trying to rig the

782
00:43:59.28 --> 00:44:01.48
elections and intimidate people.

783
00:44:01.48 --> 00:44:02.48
I'll take quick stories.

784
00:44:02.48 --> 00:44:05.68
So the range, I can't remember the name of the town.

785
00:44:05.68 --> 00:44:09.52
But north of Panama City, that we called them the ding bats.

786
00:44:09.52 --> 00:44:11.76
A ding bats removed in there.

787
00:44:11.76 --> 00:44:17.48
And they were, um, they were harassing the local populists, rape and women, doing stuff

788
00:44:17.48 --> 00:44:18.48
like that.

789
00:44:18.48 --> 00:44:23.48
So they sent a range or company up there, you know, to sort of settle things down.

790
00:44:23.48 --> 00:44:26.68
And they sent a set of this roadblock.

791
00:44:26.68 --> 00:44:29.16
And, uh, they had, you know, like any kind of blocking position.

792
00:44:29.16 --> 00:44:33.84
You have an outer cordon and then you have the main, you know, position here.

793
00:44:33.84 --> 00:44:38.80
And so they're all set up and they're checking cars and this, this car comes, green and

794
00:44:38.80 --> 00:44:39.80
up to the outer.

795
00:44:39.80 --> 00:44:45.44
They're like full of four maims, you know, military age males, bus right through the outer

796
00:44:45.44 --> 00:44:46.44
perimeter.

797
00:44:46.44 --> 00:44:48.60
So they, you know, they shoot a law at it and this is it.

798
00:44:48.60 --> 00:44:51.28
It goes over the back of the carpet, then they get to the main position.

799
00:44:51.28 --> 00:44:55.28
And I mean, they just open up with them, six days, you know, clearly within the ROI and

800
00:44:55.28 --> 00:44:57.20
just shred these guys.

801
00:44:57.20 --> 00:45:02.76
Well, it turns out they were four PDF dudes that were completely drunk as hell and, you

802
00:45:02.76 --> 00:45:06.12
know, and they had just, they just, you know, they were drunk.

803
00:45:06.12 --> 00:45:13.12
So of course, Ranger humor in the hanger, uh, there was a poster put up, rad, Rangers

804
00:45:13.12 --> 00:45:14.68
against drunk drivers.

805
00:45:14.68 --> 00:45:16.68
What's classy?

806
00:45:16.68 --> 00:45:21.12
Oh, that's freaking.

807
00:45:21.12 --> 00:45:23.56
Yeah, I don't know who did I just ever see it at.

808
00:45:23.56 --> 00:45:27.12
I was like a little humor there and, uh, yeah, Howard.

809
00:45:27.12 --> 00:45:31.000
That blue on blue thing is a, well, these guy PDF guys, these were bad guys.

810
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.88
I mean, they were, noriegas.

811
00:45:32.88 --> 00:45:34.76
Oh, they were, they were, they were in the house.

812
00:45:34.76 --> 00:45:35.76
Oh, yeah.

813
00:45:35.76 --> 00:45:36.76
Yeah, they were drunk, you know, they were drunk.

814
00:45:36.76 --> 00:45:40.76
Yeah, they were just, they weren't a threat, but we didn't know, hey, you breathe the,

815
00:45:40.76 --> 00:45:42.76
you know, the deal, you don't let them out as well.

816
00:45:42.76 --> 00:45:43.76
Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure.

817
00:45:43.76 --> 00:45:44.76
Yeah, for sure.

818
00:45:44.76 --> 00:45:46.76
No, I thought you were saying they were friendly for us.

819
00:45:46.76 --> 00:45:48.08
No, no, no, these guys were bad dudes.

820
00:45:48.08 --> 00:45:49.76
We didn't have any Panama.

821
00:45:49.76 --> 00:45:52.76
Then it gets really, then that, then rad is definitely funny.

822
00:45:52.76 --> 00:45:53.76
Oh, definitely.

823
00:45:53.76 --> 00:45:55.76
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

824
00:45:55.76 --> 00:45:58.76
Rangers against truck drivers, I love that.

825
00:45:58.76 --> 00:46:05.72
How was the, you know, from your looking back now, the mindset down there, you know,

826
00:46:05.72 --> 00:46:07.72
we just didn't have combat experience.

827
00:46:07.72 --> 00:46:14.16
Yeah, as a country at that time, I'm sure there was a few Vietnam guys here and there,

828
00:46:14.16 --> 00:46:19.72
but the bulk of the force or a bunch of bunch of guys that really didn't have combat experience.

829
00:46:19.72 --> 00:46:23.32
Yeah, no, I mean, I don't think there were, and they're might have been a couple of like

830
00:46:23.32 --> 00:46:28.32
the senior senior warrants that had some Vietnam, but most of those guys have sort of been

831
00:46:28.32 --> 00:46:29.32
out before this.

832
00:46:29.32 --> 00:46:30.72
I mean, you're talking 89.

833
00:46:30.72 --> 00:46:35.68
So, and we had practice, you know, the original codename for that was blue.

834
00:46:35.68 --> 00:46:40.68
You know, in the late chains of something, you know, patriotic, you know, just cause or whatever.

835
00:46:40.68 --> 00:46:41.68
That sounds cooler.

836
00:46:41.68 --> 00:46:46.68
Yeah, but if you go back to the planning of this blue spoon was the codename for it.

837
00:46:46.68 --> 00:46:51.68
Yeah, I was, I mean, personally, I was like, hey, this was like, don't get any better

838
00:46:51.68 --> 00:46:52.68
than that.

839
00:46:52.68 --> 00:46:55.68
I mean, this is, you know, this is cool.

840
00:46:55.68 --> 00:46:57.68
So yeah, I think we're over eager.

841
00:46:57.68 --> 00:47:01.68
You know, I'm sure we made a lot of mistakes, but, you know, we're pretty disciplined

842
00:47:01.68 --> 00:47:05.68
and our planning, and you know, I think we're much better now than we were then.

843
00:47:05.68 --> 00:47:08.68
Obviously, we got a lot of combat time.

844
00:47:08.68 --> 00:47:12.68
So I just remember being, I remember we, I loaded the airplane.

845
00:47:12.68 --> 00:47:15.68
It was snowing at minus eight at four camel or eight degrees.

846
00:47:15.68 --> 00:47:16.68
Maybe it was eight degrees.

847
00:47:16.68 --> 00:47:21.68
I just remember I stripped off all my cold weather gear, gave it to some maintenance warrant

848
00:47:21.68 --> 00:47:22.68
that wasn't going with us.

849
00:47:22.68 --> 00:47:25.68
And I said, you know, if I get clipped, you can keep this stuff.

850
00:47:25.68 --> 00:47:28.68
You know, like you don't got to turn it into the issue facility or whatever.

851
00:47:28.68 --> 00:47:30.68
You know, very profato stuff.

852
00:47:30.68 --> 00:47:31.68
Stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff on the ramp.

853
00:47:31.68 --> 00:47:32.68
You can jog wings, go around.

854
00:47:32.68 --> 00:47:33.68
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

855
00:47:33.68 --> 00:47:34.68
Yeah, yeah.

856
00:47:34.68 --> 00:47:37.68
So I could lieutenant up, my command, run the wascism, you know.

857
00:47:37.68 --> 00:47:42.68
And, but yeah, I was really excited about it.

858
00:47:42.68 --> 00:47:48.68
And, you know, another funny story we take off on, like, this is my first combat

859
00:47:48.68 --> 00:47:51.68
mission, a log in combat time, you know.

860
00:47:51.68 --> 00:47:58.68
And we are flying from Howard Air Force base out the Cologne to Fort Sherman out there.

861
00:47:58.68 --> 00:48:00.68
And it was a daylight flight.

862
00:48:00.68 --> 00:48:04.68
We were just, and we had our, you know, our minigun, you know, a standard procedure.

863
00:48:04.68 --> 00:48:10.68
I put masterpower on a front and then each of the, each of the doorgunners flips up on the minigun.

864
00:48:10.68 --> 00:48:13.68
He's got a toggle switch and you put the, all he was looking for is power.

865
00:48:13.68 --> 00:48:17.68
Because then you got two triggers, a high rate and a low rate trigger.

866
00:48:17.68 --> 00:48:20.68
But we just checked, makes you got power to the guns.

867
00:48:20.68 --> 00:48:25.68
And it was funny, Mike Durat, we were just telling, I was with him in Dallas last week.

868
00:48:25.68 --> 00:48:29.68
He's sitting there in the cargo door with his legs hanging out, they got a cargo strap up

869
00:48:29.68 --> 00:48:34.68
and the gun is slewed back, you know, to sort of face an aft.

870
00:48:34.68 --> 00:48:38.68
And the guy on the left says, yep, got power and then they shut it down.

871
00:48:38.68 --> 00:48:43.68
The guy in the right as soon as he hits the toggle switch, it just starts shooting.

872
00:48:43.68 --> 00:48:48.68
Dang. Well, when it feels, those triggers were pushed buttons and they had a rubber, like,

873
00:48:48.68 --> 00:48:49.68
boot over the top of it.

874
00:48:49.68 --> 00:48:53.68
And when they had somehow something got pushed up against it, jam the trigger in,

875
00:48:53.68 --> 00:48:55.68
and the trigger in and the bitch couldn't see it.

876
00:48:55.68 --> 00:49:01.68
So Durat, you know, he's like, you know, like a right, like you may be a foot in front of his legs.

877
00:49:01.68 --> 00:49:03.68
He got this stream of tracer going out.

878
00:49:03.68 --> 00:49:09.68
So it wasn't. And actually, you're just cleared the housing area right by the end of the runway.

879
00:49:09.68 --> 00:49:16.68
You know, and I'm like, so 0.01 a combat time and I attack military housing.

880
00:49:16.68 --> 00:49:18.68
Perfect.

881
00:49:18.68 --> 00:49:20.68
So, you know.

882
00:49:20.68 --> 00:49:27.68
You get done with that. Yeah. And that had to feel like you, you know, you got, you got some at least.

883
00:49:27.68 --> 00:49:28.68
Yeah.

884
00:49:28.68 --> 00:49:31.68
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, in rearview there.

885
00:49:31.68 --> 00:49:32.68
Yeah.

886
00:49:32.68 --> 00:49:35.68
That's the thing. I mean, we look at all the stuff we did before September 11.

887
00:49:35.68 --> 00:49:38.68
It's like, it seemed cool at the time.

888
00:49:38.68 --> 00:49:40.68
Yeah.

889
00:49:40.68 --> 00:49:42.68
You get back from that.

890
00:49:42.68 --> 00:49:44.68
And then how much longer? Wasn't that much longer?

891
00:49:44.68 --> 00:49:46.68
We're, we're jocgin up for, for Desert Storm.

892
00:49:46.68 --> 00:49:51.68
Yeah. I think it was like August when a Saddam Hussein, you know, rolled in there.

893
00:49:51.68 --> 00:49:59.68
And we deployed, we deployed out to a place called RAR, AR, AR, way out west.

894
00:49:59.68 --> 00:50:02.68
We were completely separate from the ground war.

895
00:50:02.68 --> 00:50:08.68
But we went out there actually to go after those scuds being shot into Israel to keep Israel out of the war.

896
00:50:08.68 --> 00:50:11.68
If you remember back then, they were threatening to put their own soft elements in.

897
00:50:11.68 --> 00:50:14.68
And of course, the coalition, the messarians,

898
00:50:14.68 --> 00:50:17.68
were part of that. So the Arabs, you know, didn't want anything.

899
00:50:17.68 --> 00:50:19.68
Didn't want the Israelis involved.

900
00:50:19.68 --> 00:50:26.68
So that was our mission. Again, it was Durant, Walcott, me, and, you know, several others.

901
00:50:26.68 --> 00:50:28.68
Breyley, you know, probably wasn't there.

902
00:50:28.68 --> 00:50:38.68
And we were flying. We had four birds, two would go up and do a little hot and the other two were QRF for the ground elements doing ground wrecky up there.

903
00:50:38.68 --> 00:50:41.68
And, and tackin. And then it was awesome.

904
00:50:41.68 --> 00:50:44.68
Really, really tough flying.

905
00:50:44.68 --> 00:50:48.68
I'm crashed. I'm on one of my first flights bounced off the desert floor.

906
00:50:48.68 --> 00:50:49.68
What was that happen?

907
00:50:49.68 --> 00:50:54.68
Well, we were doing a little rehearsal and sawty before we went up there.

908
00:50:54.68 --> 00:50:57.68
And I mean, you get out of town there. It's black.

909
00:50:57.68 --> 00:51:02.68
I mean, there's no ambient light, your nods, or just, you know, that sparkle you get when you can.

910
00:51:02.68 --> 00:51:05.68
I mean, you're just like, oh, these things work.

911
00:51:05.68 --> 00:51:12.68
You know, so we had infilled the daps. We were our original mission is we were going to put in a OP.

912
00:51:12.68 --> 00:51:19.68
So we had two guys in the back. And once they, the heavy birds landed with their mobility vehicle, their vehicles,

913
00:51:19.68 --> 00:51:28.68
we were going to, you know, cover them but then land, you know, out off their flanks and drop off these two dudes that we're going to just sort of be in OP form.

914
00:51:28.68 --> 00:51:31.68
They were getting their vehicles ready for movement.

915
00:51:31.68 --> 00:51:38.68
And so we had dropped these dudes off and I mean, browned out like I've never browned out before, you know, it was just, it was horrible.

916
00:51:38.68 --> 00:51:48.68
We were climbing out and the other guy was on the controls and I'm ahead over in the cockpit trying to punch up something on this navigation system because GPS was brand new.

917
00:51:48.68 --> 00:51:54.68
And the crew chief, who I'm still very close with a promoter a couple times and said, yells out, check altitude.

918
00:51:54.68 --> 00:52:02.68
And we got a clear screen, you know, in front of me with a, what we call rat out a radar, all timeter, which is absolute altitude over the ground.

919
00:52:02.68 --> 00:52:07.68
It's not a mean sea level. It is how far you are until you get it to ground. And it said zero.

920
00:52:07.68 --> 00:52:12.68
And I just reached over with one hand and pulled up on the collective.

921
00:52:12.68 --> 00:52:20.68
And as we smack the ground and came up in this cloud at dust and bent the antennas on the bottom of the airplanes, split the tail wheel room and half.

922
00:52:20.68 --> 00:52:27.68
I mean, it was, I mean, I couldn't even talk for like 30 seconds and I look already at a guy I'm like, dude, what the hell?

923
00:52:27.68 --> 00:52:30.68
It was what I couldn't see. I was like, where are you going to tell me that? We're underground.

924
00:52:30.68 --> 00:52:34.68
I mean, what was the plan here? Because we just cheated death, you know?

925
00:52:34.68 --> 00:52:43.68
And we had several close calls over there. Probably any time more than I've had not directly enemy related was, you know, those dust storms.

926
00:52:43.68 --> 00:52:48.68
You'd hit those things up in western Iraq, which were just fierce.

927
00:52:48.68 --> 00:52:56.68
There was typical those things. Oh, I know these biblical storms where I was looking going, this is right out of the Bible.

928
00:52:56.68 --> 00:53:00.68
There's a freaking lot of sand is coming and it's crazy.

929
00:53:00.68 --> 00:53:02.68
I mean, I mean, it's violent.

930
00:53:02.68 --> 00:53:09.68
I mean, when it hits you, it's just like, I mean, it's like a tsunami coming at you. I mean, no, you know, I mean, I know you're, yeah, yeah.

931
00:53:09.68 --> 00:53:11.68
I can exactly picture which you're looking at that.

932
00:53:11.68 --> 00:53:18.68
Sure. And the bottom of it. There's coming at you. And you're like, oh, yeah, yeah. We're going to redo the windows after this.

933
00:53:18.68 --> 00:53:23.68
You know, that was bad. Yeah. So what were the profiles like so what were the profiles like for those

934
00:53:23.68 --> 00:53:28.68
Ops that you were doing out looking for scud missiles in the Iraqi desert.

935
00:53:28.68 --> 00:53:36.68
So we'd go up there. You know, we had ground elements up there and we'd fly up there and we'd get sometimes we'd get some intel.

936
00:53:36.68 --> 00:53:41.68
Because there was, you know, before they launched a scud, there were certain things that would happen in advance of that.

937
00:53:41.68 --> 00:53:47.68
And I think I got the moment, Claytcher, right? But they had an N-tray radar, which was a meteorological radar.

938
00:53:47.68 --> 00:53:54.68
And that thing would come up a few hours before it'd massed and do a 360-sweet, get a bunch of atmospheric data to plug in.

939
00:53:54.68 --> 00:54:01.68
Because I mean, the scuds weren't really guided. I mean, they weren't, you know, there wasn't like, hey, we're going to hit this building.

940
00:54:01.68 --> 00:54:06.68
It wasn't like that. They had a target in mind, but it was a ballistic solution.

941
00:54:06.68 --> 00:54:12.68
So we'd see that thing come up. And in fact, one night we were up there and they'd rivet join or whatever.

942
00:54:12.68 --> 00:54:18.68
Call us and said, hey, we got a hit on this entry radar.

943
00:54:18.68 --> 00:54:22.68
And I was chalked to flying off of Walcott.

944
00:54:22.68 --> 00:54:30.68
And sure enough, in this little water, this truck was sitting down there like it looks like a common truck with a big box van on it and a mast.

945
00:54:30.68 --> 00:54:35.68
And I'm like, we smoke that dude. I mean, we came in. And in fact, we got so close.

946
00:54:35.68 --> 00:54:40.68
The lead bird got so close and they were shooting. They got a secondary off the truck.

947
00:54:40.68 --> 00:54:46.68
And it shattered to windshield. And copiled, they said every time they got over 100 knots of windshields, started cave and in.

948
00:54:46.68 --> 00:54:50.68
So we flew with one foot up there, holding the windshield out. We're going back in there.

949
00:54:50.68 --> 00:54:55.68
I mean, it was cool. So we, you know, shot that. We have some scuds.

950
00:54:55.68 --> 00:54:59.68
And there's a lot of debate to this day. If you Google it, you'll see pictures of them.

951
00:54:59.68 --> 00:55:09.68
That they were probably decoys. But they stopped shooting after that. I mean, we basically they quit shooting within a week of us going up there.

952
00:55:09.68 --> 00:55:13.68
And so we were all over them. You know, our missions were five, six hours long.

953
00:55:13.68 --> 00:55:19.68
We had to get Ox fuel tank, scrap cargo strap to the floor, just to just to make it up that far.

954
00:55:19.68 --> 00:55:22.68
Thank.

955
00:55:22.68 --> 00:55:25.68
That one didn't last very long either.

956
00:55:25.68 --> 00:55:34.68
No, I mean, for us, it started pretty like I didn't even know the war started except that we had a 10k loop around the airfield that we go run.

957
00:55:34.68 --> 00:55:44.68
And I remember I went out there was a little sign on an easel out there. Something that said, got to run with your gas mask on your hip, which of course, you know, again, I'm a first Lieutenant. I'm like, yeah, really?

958
00:55:44.68 --> 00:55:50.68
I mean, come on. Yeah, it's a pain and yes. And that was, and I learned later. I said the war started.

959
00:55:50.68 --> 00:55:59.68
Well, a funny story. I was out on my first mission flying. And you can thank your brethren in the Navy on this one.

960
00:55:59.68 --> 00:56:06.68
The other crews were sitting in the air terminal at this RR airfield.

961
00:56:06.68 --> 00:56:12.68
And in the middle of night, boom, you know, a missile comes in.

962
00:56:12.68 --> 00:56:25.68
And everybody, it wasn't enough like a bomb, but it was a missile. And everybody's looking and they thought it was a chemical attack. So you know, everybody's, you know, assholes and elbows and trapeen, you know, everybody's putting their mass on and all that.

963
00:56:25.68 --> 00:56:31.68
What it happened is, is all navigation, all agents supposed to be shut off.

964
00:56:31.68 --> 00:56:37.68
And they had forgot and left a tack on on, you know, a digital thing at distance.

965
00:56:37.68 --> 00:56:47.68
And EA six was coming back, going back to the red sea. Now, keep on mind, we're 35 miles inside of Saudi. I mean, it's not like, you know, we're right on the border.

966
00:56:47.68 --> 00:56:54.68
And this dude lets one of those harm missiles go and it comes in and, you know, those things are like a giant shotgun shell.

967
00:56:54.68 --> 00:57:01.68
They get to a certain point and then it just opens up and it's like a bunch of buckshot goes in and it takes out the radar and that's what it was.

968
00:57:01.68 --> 00:57:12.68
In fact, I don't think I still have him, but I had a piece of, you know, US Navy on the radar, you know, it's only a tack was from an EA six off of a carrier in the red sea.

969
00:57:12.68 --> 00:57:13.68
Ouch.

970
00:57:13.68 --> 00:57:14.68
Yeah.

971
00:57:14.68 --> 00:57:29.68
And did you notice, I mean, the mindset, how many how many pilots are how much experience did you bring from Panama now you're doing kind of more operations or was it like, hey, we're still still feeling pretty green at this.

972
00:57:29.68 --> 00:57:36.68
You know, we certainly, I think the tension and the anticipation we were getting used to that, you know, from Panama.

973
00:57:36.68 --> 00:57:47.68
Of course, the environment was completely different. This, you know, Panama was basically urban, really, I mean, for the most part.

974
00:57:47.68 --> 00:57:52.68
The child in the flying was much more difficult on desert storm for sure.

975
00:57:52.68 --> 00:58:05.68
But remember we'd had prime chance, right, operate enough the barges we'd had just cause now myself and that was pretty much the norm. We'd all sort of been involved in that and now this is our sort of our third gig for that current generation.

976
00:58:05.68 --> 00:58:12.68
So I think there was a sense of confidence there may be a little overconfidence.

977
00:58:12.68 --> 00:58:21.68
You know, I don't, I wish I would have got more time flying in the desert and those kind of conditions. I mean, that was like, that was definitely a different level than I'd ever been.

978
00:58:21.68 --> 00:58:29.68
I'd ever experienced before in humbling. So yeah, you know, planning wise, we were good. We know what we needed to do.

979
00:58:29.68 --> 00:58:38.68
Got to revise, we were good. Probably environmentalists were our biggest challenge just like you said, those sams are you see one of those things coming on me and you're like,

980
00:58:38.68 --> 00:58:44.68
Mommy, you know, I mean it's like, you know, this is not going to end well, you know.

981
00:58:44.68 --> 00:58:52.68
You get done with that. Where's your next, where'd you go after that? So we got out of, we got back from Desert Storm.

982
00:58:52.68 --> 00:59:00.68
And this is when I went to this, you know, then downings that, hey, I want you, would you, can I was supposed to go fly with the Marines fly cobras at you,

983
00:59:00.68 --> 00:59:16.68
and then the human is an instructor pilot down there. That's where I was going to go. And then downings that I want you to go to Hurlbert to fly with Air Force Special Ops Command as Exchange Pilot. Let's start, you know, let's start combining you guys. You're, I can't feel them a coi's on there.

984
00:59:16.68 --> 00:59:27.68
So, I, that's where I went. I went through Kurtland Air Force Base out in New Mexico, you know, to go through the Air Force version of the 60 qualification course.

985
00:59:27.68 --> 00:59:42.68
And I went to a 50 fifth Special Ops Quadrant, and I mean loved it. Man, it was, you know, I was, I'd never air refuel before I'd never done, you know, and it's just a completely different approach to aviation than the army has.

986
00:59:42.68 --> 00:59:52.68
I mean, and I love to flew there for four years and you know, flew my butt off ended up being an instructor pilot there and just really,

987
00:59:52.68 --> 00:59:59.68
and you were still flying 60s though? Yeah, because they, they wanted me to, they were ideally, I would have transitioned over to 53.

988
00:59:59.68 --> 01:00:05.68
Yeah. The problem was it was just one of those military things. It was a year-long course.

989
01:00:05.68 --> 01:00:12.68
So they had to do a permanent change of station to give me and, uh, Kurtland, and then another permanent change of station to get back to Hurlbert,

990
01:00:12.68 --> 01:00:21.68
and nobody wanted to pay for that. So I went there on temporary duty for four months, and I mean, I, I'd already had 2,000 hours in the black cock.

991
01:00:21.68 --> 01:00:28.68
I mean, I, you know, what, this wasn't, you know, like rocket science to me, you know, so I sort of went through the course pretty quick.

992
01:00:28.68 --> 01:00:35.68
I just had to learn Air Force Rags on. You, you couldn't convince him, hey, if somebody can just show me how to turn on this 50s, I got actually there.

993
01:00:35.68 --> 01:00:43.68
I actually got to start it, but the, you know, the Air Force has like these, you know, they're, they have a lot more rags, regulations and stuff that you got to learn,

994
01:00:43.68 --> 01:00:47.68
and the army, it's like, much less.

995
01:00:47.68 --> 01:00:51.68
So you said the view on aviation was different. What else was different?

996
01:00:51.68 --> 01:00:56.68
Um, the culture is a little different. I mean, they're great guys, you know, I mean, the current J.S.

997
01:00:56.68 --> 01:01:03.68
Commander Scott Howell was in my sister squadron, the current Air Force Special Ops, Command Jim's Slyf, and now they're both 3 stars.

998
01:01:03.68 --> 01:01:08.68
They were, we were like, run and mate, so with air, you know.

999
01:01:08.68 --> 01:01:14.68
You know, the Air Force and the Navy with the exception of the SEAL community are really platforms, central, right?

1000
01:01:14.68 --> 01:01:19.68
They've man a platform, the Navy man's a ship, the Air Force man's an aircraft.

1001
01:01:19.68 --> 01:01:29.68
The army and the Marines, and, you know, in the SEALs, we equip the soldier or the sailor or the Marine.

1002
01:01:29.68 --> 01:01:38.68
So it's a different, it's a different mindset there. And I don't mean I would, I'm not implying for a second that they're not good at their job,

1003
01:01:38.68 --> 01:01:48.68
but, you know, they value that platform. I mean, when I was a 160th Commander, I lost three aircraft in a week.

1004
01:01:48.68 --> 01:01:54.68
I had Tusha Knux, Land Hard, and Rift the Gear off one had to be blown in place. It was way up in the Hindu Kush.

1005
01:01:54.68 --> 01:02:01.68
The other we stripped it down in a 53, the Marines slung it out force, and the third was on a day mission in the Helman.

1006
01:02:01.68 --> 01:02:12.68
And got hit with an RPG and crashed. I mean, you know, I think in the Air Force you to get relief for that, you know, in the army I never even got a call.

1007
01:02:12.68 --> 01:02:28.68
I mean, I had to report it on the standard operap kind of stuff, but I think, you know, the army just hated Jaffitalities, and we didn't, you know, they we lost, you know, probably a hundred million dollars worth of aircraft, but we didn't have a fatality.

1008
01:02:28.68 --> 01:02:36.68
And again, it's just a different, you know, and the other thing about us is we only exist to support the guy on the ground.

1009
01:02:36.68 --> 01:02:47.68
I mean, the 160th Army Aviation isn't a, you know, isn't strategic air power, right? It's tactical, you know, we only exist to support it. So that's our mindset.

1010
01:02:47.68 --> 01:03:00.68
You know, the pilots, a lot of the warrants, I mean, a good percentage of our former Green Berets, I had some former seals Bobby Moore was in the 16th of May of former seal, a lot of Rangers in there.

1011
01:03:00.68 --> 01:03:06.68
So there's a great empathy for the guy on the ground, right? And I think that's just our culture.

1012
01:03:06.68 --> 01:03:21.68
Yeah, when I had this guy, Colonel Matt Jackson, who was a Huey pilot in Vietnam, they sent 5,000 Huey's to Vietnam, 3,200 of them were lost in combat. Oh, yeah.

1013
01:03:21.68 --> 01:03:30.68
Oh, yeah, I know lots of guys who were shocked down. We were talking, and I, you know, he said, well, he was a Huey cost, I don't know, a couple hundred thousand dollars back then.

1014
01:03:30.68 --> 01:03:39.68
I said, well, how much is a black hawk? And he goes, I don't know, maybe 500,000, and I was like, I don't know if that's right, sir. But it's like 20 million.

1015
01:03:39.68 --> 01:03:49.68
Right. Yeah, well, one of ours is about 23. I think you could probably in the UH 60 Mike is somewhere between 15 and 20 million somewhere around there.

1016
01:03:49.68 --> 01:03:58.68
I was suspect. They're not throwing those things away. No, but they, you know, but again, I mean, I, when I was the 160th commander at the time, I was told this,

1017
01:03:58.68 --> 01:04:06.68
and I can't prove it, but I'm pretty sure it's true. We had more casualties from any O6 level command in soft.

1018
01:04:06.68 --> 01:04:12.68
We had had more than anyone. And you think about, we had red wing, we had a bunch of those.

1019
01:04:12.68 --> 01:04:21.68
And, you know, but we didn't stop us. I mean, we never changed. I mean, we just kept, we got better, right?

1020
01:04:21.68 --> 01:04:34.68
But we, yeah, we lost a lot of aircraft and a lot of people, should our red wings, we lost, you know, we had the QRF was H sales and we had 816th guys on there.

1021
01:04:34.68 --> 01:04:43.68
Yeah. So you come home. You're now, so now it's like 1991. We're about to enter the kind of the dry years.

1022
01:04:43.68 --> 01:04:51.68
Yep. Go to, you know, AFSOC Air Force Special Ops command from there until 96. This is where you meet your wife.

1023
01:04:51.68 --> 01:04:56.68
Yep. You said she was a, the squadron in Tel-Opser. And, you know, of course, like I said.

1024
01:04:56.68 --> 01:05:03.68
I didn't figure you out. What happened? Oh, she's like, you know, who is the, you know, best looking dude, most manly dude here.

1025
01:05:03.68 --> 01:05:08.68
Clearly, you know, he's made, you know, I mean, I'm a total chick magnet.

1026
01:05:08.68 --> 01:05:15.68
And, you know, but we end up, yeah, we end up getting married and then I went to a classified assignment from there.

1027
01:05:15.68 --> 01:05:23.68
And, and she, we'd already had one kid and then she went, you know, so it was one of those dual military which is tough.

1028
01:05:23.68 --> 01:05:27.68
And then when she got pregnant with our second, she, she elected to get out.

1029
01:05:27.68 --> 01:05:37.68
And, you know, and I'm grateful because we have it about, you know, three boys total. And I mean, she gets all the credit in the world for raising him because I mean her, her deal was,

1030
01:05:37.68 --> 01:05:41.68
you know, that you go out and play Captain America. Oh, you know, take care of the family here.

1031
01:05:41.68 --> 01:05:48.68
So I remain indebted to her and very respectful of her because she would have been at least a colonel in my opinion.

1032
01:05:48.68 --> 01:05:53.68
You know, you know, you see a young officer, you know, who's got it, who's not going to go far.

1033
01:05:53.68 --> 01:05:58.68
And who is, and she was clearly one of those that was going to go far.

1034
01:05:58.68 --> 01:06:02.68
So you get, how long were you at this classified assignment for?

1035
01:06:02.68 --> 01:06:09.68
Let's see, six years. I did a year at Navy, Newport. Okay.

1036
01:06:09.68 --> 01:06:12.68
That's why I met Colin Green, we were next to our neighbors.

1037
01:06:12.68 --> 01:06:24.68
And so I did that in from 96 to 02. Then I went back to the 160th and was exo, first time, and then ended up commanding a couple years later.

1038
01:06:24.68 --> 01:06:28.68
So when September 11th goes down, you're in Newport going to War College or something?

1039
01:06:28.68 --> 01:06:38.68
No, I was in Budapest on an exercise. When it happened, we were over there doing a, you know, was one of those.

1040
01:06:38.68 --> 01:06:44.68
I think it was like a loose, new kind of thing, you know, exercise.

1041
01:06:44.68 --> 01:06:56.68
And that's where I was. And then, you know, a few weeks later I was deployed, you know, I won't go to the deal, but I was deployed in the Pakistan and basically, you know, the world changed for all of us after that.

1042
01:06:56.68 --> 01:07:01.68
So when you started doing missions, when do, when did you get back to the 160th?

1043
01:07:01.68 --> 01:07:12.68
I got back to the 160th in June of, was right around Father's Day of 02.

1044
01:07:12.68 --> 01:07:21.68
And then, you know, I took over as the executive officer of first the 160th, which is, you know, the, the biggest batai in there.

1045
01:07:21.68 --> 01:07:29.68
And that's where I grew up. And then we ended up, you know, a few months later, two months later, I was in Afghanistan, did back to back to back to ours.

1046
01:07:29.68 --> 01:07:33.68
And then we invaded Iraq. How long were your tours over there?

1047
01:07:33.68 --> 01:07:40.68
Back then, we were doing, I was doing about, I did 60 days, so it was back for 30 days, I went back for another 60 days.

1048
01:07:40.68 --> 01:07:46.68
And then I came back, because we had an alert package. So you had to, you know, you had to have that ready to go.

1049
01:07:46.68 --> 01:07:53.68
So when I wasn't forward, I was back sitting on alert. And then I ended up in Iraq and May.

1050
01:07:53.68 --> 01:07:57.68
So what kind of officer you run in Afghanistan? Were you flying as the exo?

1051
01:07:57.68 --> 01:07:58.68
Yeah. Oh yeah.

1052
01:07:58.68 --> 01:07:59.68
Get it.

1053
01:07:59.68 --> 01:08:01.68
Yeah, I was, it was fun.

1054
01:08:01.68 --> 01:08:05.68
I'm gonna have Afghanistan. I mean, that's some challenge in flying right over there.

1055
01:08:05.68 --> 01:08:09.68
I mean, you know, that, you know, that place is like, no, call the rooftop of the world for nothing.

1056
01:08:09.68 --> 01:08:17.68
I mean, I was very, you know, my fondest saying, and I still say it, you know, if you compare Iraq to Afghanistan,

1057
01:08:17.68 --> 01:08:25.68
the enemy in Iraq is the enemy. It's the insurgents, right? I mean, the terrain is, except for those, you know, biblical dust storms over there.

1058
01:08:25.68 --> 01:08:27.68
I mean, it's not very challenging terrain.

1059
01:08:27.68 --> 01:08:30.68
You know, it's usually not very, it's usually predictable, too.

1060
01:08:30.68 --> 01:08:32.68
Yeah, it's got to be hot hot.

1061
01:08:32.68 --> 01:08:36.68
Or in the winter time, it's going to be cold, but it's pretty, it's pretty predictable, yeah.

1062
01:08:36.68 --> 01:08:41.68
Afghanistan, I mean, you know, you're up at the highest altitudes. I mean, everybody's running on that.

1063
01:08:41.68 --> 01:08:49.68
You little birds are essentially worthless over there. You know, if they were carrying anything and the shenooks ended up being the heavy lift or forest in sort,

1064
01:08:49.68 --> 01:08:54.68
ops up in, you know, way up in the Hindu coast, you mean, blackhawks couldn't even do it.

1065
01:08:54.68 --> 01:08:56.68
So very, very challenging flying there.

1066
01:08:56.68 --> 01:09:03.68
And the early days, you know, they were launching on a K2 out of Karachi, Kana-Bad and his biggest and going north and do,

1067
01:09:03.68 --> 01:09:09.68
so is it like when you're flying at that altitude and the helicopter? Is it like you're driving on, on like wet pavement,

1068
01:09:09.68 --> 01:09:13.68
where you just don't get the reactions that you would normally get?

1069
01:09:13.68 --> 01:09:17.68
Yeah, I mean, it depends on the altitude, the aircraft is not as responsive,

1070
01:09:17.68 --> 01:09:22.68
but where you really pay the price is if you get when you're doing an approach in there,

1071
01:09:22.68 --> 01:09:27.68
I mean, you got a closely managed or power, or you're going to get in trouble.

1072
01:09:27.68 --> 01:09:30.68
If you let momentum develop on that descent into the approach,

1073
01:09:30.68 --> 01:09:36.68
I mean, you don't have the power to go around, you know, you're committed regardless of the enemy situation.

1074
01:09:36.68 --> 01:09:43.68
So it's just really, you're just very, very limited on power and options up at altitude.

1075
01:09:43.68 --> 01:09:52.68
So, you know, I remember flying missions up 14,000 feet, so you got to be on O2 with 47's in there.

1076
01:09:52.68 --> 01:09:57.68
You know, they're allowable load was like eight guys and a shenook.

1077
01:09:57.68 --> 01:10:01.68
I mean, usually it's plus or minus a ton of those things, right?

1078
01:10:01.68 --> 01:10:05.68
I mean, you know, just keep back in a man. I've seen a hundred Rangers in a shenook before.

1079
01:10:05.68 --> 01:10:07.68
And you're down to eight eight.

1080
01:10:07.68 --> 01:10:13.68
When you guys knew, did you have any time to say, hey, we better go start flying, you know, around the Rocky Mountains?

1081
01:10:13.68 --> 01:10:15.68
Nope, just figure later we did.

1082
01:10:15.68 --> 01:10:21.68
Later we'd start prepping, we'd go out, fact we lost an airplane, a Mount Masso Colorado guys training up to go in there.

1083
01:10:21.68 --> 01:10:26.68
A lost four guys. I was a commander at the time, but in the initial days, no.

1084
01:10:26.68 --> 01:10:29.68
Nothing, I'm because you know it was a come as you are, deal.

1085
01:10:29.68 --> 01:10:34.68
So do you know, I just knowledge that you know, like, okay, well, we're at altitude.

1086
01:10:34.68 --> 01:10:38.68
This is going to suck. Yeah. Well, I mean, you do the performance planning, right?

1087
01:10:38.68 --> 01:10:43.68
So you get, you understand what the aircraft can, and most importantly, can't do it those altitude.

1088
01:10:43.68 --> 01:10:48.68
So, but you're, you know, you're sort of at denial at those numbers, you know?

1089
01:10:48.68 --> 01:10:52.68
I mean, I never thought I'd say eight guys and a shenook.

1090
01:10:52.68 --> 01:10:57.68
Plus you had to deal with the brownout. That dust was just really, really bad.

1091
01:10:57.68 --> 01:11:05.68
Worst in the southern part, down in Helman and down in those areas around Cantehar, less so up in, you know, up in, you know,

1092
01:11:05.68 --> 01:11:12.68
Hindu Kush Mountains up in the north, but, you know, I mean, it was brutal fly and brutal.

1093
01:11:12.68 --> 01:11:17.68
So you, you first got over there, your first to point, what's your up tempo like?

1094
01:11:17.68 --> 01:11:29.68
So I got over there the first time I was there. I think, September of O2 or August of O2 through maybe October, or maybe in November.

1095
01:11:29.68 --> 01:11:34.68
I can't remember. But we did do fair amount of missions.

1096
01:11:34.68 --> 01:11:40.68
And, and then, you know, I, the last, next time I went over there, I think I was there in January.

1097
01:11:40.68 --> 01:11:51.68
Now, I left December, I'm at right left December, right before Christmas, 30 days to the day. I was right back in the same crappy little tent that there at Boggrum, you know, with rain water.

1098
01:11:51.68 --> 01:11:55.68
I mean, I was just water running through it and everything.

1099
01:11:55.68 --> 01:12:02.68
And then from January through March, because, you know, they were spinning up at the latter part of that to go into Iraq, right?

1100
01:12:02.68 --> 01:12:05.68
We were, they got the word, we're going in.

1101
01:12:05.68 --> 01:12:10.68
And we didn't do much. I mean, because weather was really crappy.

1102
01:12:10.68 --> 01:12:20.68
I did a couple of missions, some pretty challenging ones, way, way up in, in some areas that were very tricky for aviation.

1103
01:12:20.68 --> 01:12:27.68
In fact, I, one, I was so high in a place called Cantigua that we couldn't have any fire support.

1104
01:12:27.68 --> 01:12:29.68
I mean, the airplanes wouldn't perform.

1105
01:12:29.68 --> 01:12:37.68
So I just selected to stay on the axe, right? We infilled and I got the ground force commander, so give me a couple of guys cover our blind spots.

1106
01:12:37.68 --> 01:12:44.68
We're just going to go to ground, I'd a way you guys clear and get whatever you're getting and then hop back in and we'll, normally, you know, the deal.

1107
01:12:44.68 --> 01:12:56.68
We come in, we land, drop off and then split, we did, we just stayed and, you know, pull the engines back, because I didn't, I didn't want to, it took us two hour turn to go get gas down the hill and come back.

1108
01:12:56.68 --> 01:12:59.68
And I didn't want to leave them up there for that long, so we said, he will just hang out.

1109
01:12:59.68 --> 01:13:03.68
How long are you on the ground for? About 45 minutes to an hour.

1110
01:13:03.68 --> 01:13:08.68
It wasn't that bad. It was cold though. I mean, it was freezing snow and everything else.

1111
01:13:08.68 --> 01:13:12.68
It was like I said, February or something.

1112
01:13:12.68 --> 01:13:19.68
How, how, at what point did you notice that people were just like, this is what we're, this is what we're doing.

1113
01:13:19.68 --> 01:13:23.68
This is the new reality. You know, when I talked, you know, you were talking about, I was talking about the mindset,

1114
01:13:23.68 --> 01:13:31.68
you know, when you did Panama and then you did desert storm and you, you're not quite there yet. You know, you're, you're not quite there yet.

1115
01:13:31.68 --> 01:13:38.68
And then, you know, we were talking earlier, my first deployment to Iraq, it's like, oh, we're doing it, you know, it's like, oh, yeah, we're doing another off.

1116
01:13:38.68 --> 01:13:41.68
This is just what we're doing. It's just, think, becomes normal.

1117
01:13:41.68 --> 01:13:44.68
Yeah.

1118
01:13:44.68 --> 01:13:52.68
I think that really, you know, there was the optempo, the operational tempo in Afghanistan, wasn't that bad.

1119
01:13:52.68 --> 01:14:05.68
Just because of the terrain and the planning and we didn't have all the ISR back then, you know, we didn't have all that, all the, you know, the tools to give us good situational awareness on targets like we ended up having an Iraq.

1120
01:14:05.68 --> 01:14:10.68
Where I saw that it was, we really became just sort of another day at the office was an Iraq.

1121
01:14:10.68 --> 01:14:17.68
So I went over in May and I will never forget my boss, the same name, may of both three got it.

1122
01:14:17.68 --> 01:14:27.68
So my boss, you know, they had punched up there around March or so, I think, you know, they did that big, went into Baghdad International Airport.

1123
01:14:27.68 --> 01:14:36.68
I came in and I, you know, the exo is sort of the, you know, he's the guy in charge of all the staff and, you know, logistics and all that kind of stuff.

1124
01:14:36.68 --> 01:14:44.68
And my boss and hey, come over here, we're, we're going to be out of here in 30 days. I just want you to make sure we got property accountability and you get all your stuff and get out.

1125
01:14:44.68 --> 01:14:50.68
And I was like, you know, I mean, I had been to Iraq so I'm like, sign me up chief on my head, you know.

1126
01:14:50.68 --> 01:14:59.68
Yeah, so I showed up there, you know, of course, you know, 30 days never happened, but, man, well, I mean, the best time.

1127
01:14:59.68 --> 01:15:05.68
I mean, we did, we did some ops that were just incredible.

1128
01:15:05.68 --> 01:15:09.68
I mean, the optempo was really, really high. I mean, we were bang and targets.

1129
01:15:09.68 --> 01:15:18.68
We did an op, it's been in several magazines, operandere. It was a bunch of, a bunch of foreign fighters had gathered.

1130
01:15:18.68 --> 01:15:23.68
They were getting ready to split up and attack coalition bases with teams of three.

1131
01:15:23.68 --> 01:15:32.68
And we got the intel on him, a win-in with a half-gaff kind of thing, you know, helicopter, self-force for the audience and ground the soft force on each side of this body.

1132
01:15:32.68 --> 01:15:39.68
And I mean, it was, it was game on. I mean, when we fought for about two hours, killed about a hundred of them,

1133
01:15:39.68 --> 01:15:45.68
a young Ranger took an RPG below the knee. You know, we cast a vacuum.

1134
01:15:45.68 --> 01:15:49.68
I'm still in touch with him, Matt Waters. He's up in Tacoma's a cop right now.

1135
01:15:49.68 --> 01:15:55.68
Yeah, he is. He's done, I mean, the second Ranger with time, B.C.O. 275 was the unit.

1136
01:15:55.68 --> 01:16:02.68
I mean, I was a mission of a lifetime. You know, I was, I was, I was, air-missured commander right in the jump seat of a 47.

1137
01:16:02.68 --> 01:16:05.68
Tracer, coming in underneath the tracer fireman. It was awesome.

1138
01:16:05.68 --> 01:16:11.68
In fact, that was, the tracer fire was coming out my left side. You know, in the course of your chest plates meant to protect your chest.

1139
01:16:11.68 --> 01:16:16.68
I was loose it up my side, stradden, slid it around, just like, I'm going to get clipped.

1140
01:16:16.68 --> 01:16:18.68
It's going to be over here, you know.

1141
01:16:18.68 --> 01:16:24.68
But just a great mission. A.H.6 is just crushing them and it was a fight went on for a couple hours.

1142
01:16:24.68 --> 01:16:30.68
Did a lot of engagements shooting them for us out of the side of the, because the Rangers were so close to the enemy

1143
01:16:30.68 --> 01:16:32.68
that we didn't want to use many guns because they were ricochets.

1144
01:16:32.68 --> 01:16:38.68
So we just hover in there and the A.H.6 guys had taken them out with M4s and pectus and all that.

1145
01:16:38.68 --> 01:16:43.68
So it was a good, now it remains the best mission I ever did. It was awesome.

1146
01:16:43.68 --> 01:16:48.68
And so this is, this is in like, that was June, a little bit of a thousand three.

1147
01:16:48.68 --> 01:16:54.68
And this is now where we're getting into legit optempo. This is what we're doing reload.

1148
01:16:54.68 --> 01:16:58.68
Get jokged up again. We're going out tomorrow. Here's the next target.

1149
01:16:58.68 --> 01:17:04.68
It went from that till, you know, you flash forward now a couple years later, right prior to the surge.

1150
01:17:04.68 --> 01:17:08.68
And we were running, we'd be running seven eight ops and night.

1151
01:17:08.68 --> 01:17:15.68
I mean, I'd have those big screen TVs and I saw our track in multiple ops out of, out of, uh, blood.

1152
01:17:15.68 --> 01:17:21.68
And I mean, it was just nonstop. So you went for 30 days. How long did you end up staying for?

1153
01:17:21.68 --> 01:17:24.68
Well, he said it was going to be 30 days. So I left and August.

1154
01:17:24.68 --> 01:17:29.68
So I was there about 90 or so. And then I came back, was back for two months.

1155
01:17:29.68 --> 01:17:33.68
And then I went over there for Christmas and spent, you know, another 60.

1156
01:17:33.68 --> 01:17:36.68
And then I, you know, a lot of guys can tell you how many times are over there.

1157
01:17:36.68 --> 01:17:41.68
I don't have no idea. I just lost track. I mean, I was just, you know, it was back and forth, back and forth.

1158
01:17:41.68 --> 01:17:45.68
And what point did you go? Were you exiled the whole time or did you eventually freed up?

1159
01:17:45.68 --> 01:17:55.68
No, so that Army does a little different. And so I was exiled from 2002 to 2004.

1160
01:17:55.68 --> 01:18:02.68
And then to command first to the one 60th, it's a special board called the special mission, you know, board that meets.

1161
01:18:02.68 --> 01:18:06.68
And you have to have commanded another O5 level command before that.

1162
01:18:06.68 --> 01:18:13.68
So I got selected, went over to Germany and commanded for two years over at Germany, which was, you know, a great.

1163
01:18:13.68 --> 01:18:18.68
I wouldn't call it a breather, you know, commands command, but I didn't deploy.

1164
01:18:18.68 --> 01:18:23.68
And so I, you know, the family and I, you know, drank a bunch of half-ease and paid a bunch of chocolate.

1165
01:18:23.68 --> 01:18:25.68
You know, it looked like a cross-sauce.

1166
01:18:25.68 --> 01:18:30.68
My wife's like, man, this camera makes us look fat. Oh, yeah, that's definitely.

1167
01:18:30.68 --> 01:18:38.68
And so you did that toward it. And then I got picked up to go back to one one 60.

1168
01:18:38.68 --> 01:18:44.68
And which was O, O, six to O, eight.

1169
01:18:44.68 --> 01:18:50.68
And then the guy that was supposed to take the regiment opted to retire instead, you know, for personal reasons.

1170
01:18:50.68 --> 01:18:54.68
And they, they did a special, they,

1171
01:18:54.68 --> 01:19:01.68
I, my name went into command, you know, to be considered for command and the regiment at the O, six level.

1172
01:19:01.68 --> 01:19:05.68
So I did, I came right out of first in the one 60, moved my box.

1173
01:19:05.68 --> 01:19:08.68
I loved me stuff and walked down the hallway and took over the regiment.

1174
01:19:08.68 --> 01:19:11.68
So I was in command six straight years.

1175
01:19:11.68 --> 01:19:12.68
Day. Yeah.

1176
01:19:12.68 --> 01:19:14.68
But, you know, you don't realize how tired you are.

1177
01:19:14.68 --> 01:19:17.68
My wife's like, yeah, you're smoked. I'm like, nine smoked.

1178
01:19:17.68 --> 01:19:20.68
I'm like, little energized or bunny here. I'm ready to keep going.

1179
01:19:20.68 --> 01:19:22.68
When you, when you went back as battalion commander.

1180
01:19:22.68 --> 01:19:26.68
So what was that? So now now it's 2006. What was your most your focus?

1181
01:19:26.68 --> 01:19:33.68
Iraq. So we were totally engaged in Iraq. So myself, my exo and my opso, we were on a three.

1182
01:19:33.68 --> 01:19:37.68
You know, so it was one of the three of us was downrange as a task force commander forward.

1183
01:19:37.68 --> 01:19:40.68
So I was totally committed.

1184
01:19:40.68 --> 01:19:43.68
We were totally committed to Iraq. We did some other stuff.

1185
01:19:43.68 --> 01:19:47.68
We had some stuff in South America pop up where we deployed operationally.

1186
01:19:47.68 --> 01:19:50.68
There was, you know, some hostage stuff going on down there.

1187
01:19:50.68 --> 01:19:53.68
But we were completely, mainly we were focused.

1188
01:19:53.68 --> 01:19:55.68
And I was really worried about keeping the team together.

1189
01:19:55.68 --> 01:19:59.68
We've never, we've been in a fight now. This is for several years.

1190
01:19:59.68 --> 01:20:02.68
So chronic fatigue was an issue for me.

1191
01:20:02.68 --> 01:20:04.68
I was really worried that wheels were going to come off.

1192
01:20:04.68 --> 01:20:10.68
So a lot of my focus was keeping, you know, making trauma monitoring the players

1193
01:20:10.68 --> 01:20:13.68
and making sure that we're, you know, doing the best.

1194
01:20:13.68 --> 01:20:18.68
And I got my crystal there who is, you know, aviation is the pacing item over there.

1195
01:20:18.68 --> 01:20:21.68
So they want more and more and more.

1196
01:20:21.68 --> 01:20:24.68
So, you know, and I always, I told him a crystal this several years later.

1197
01:20:24.68 --> 01:20:29.68
My job was to try to meet your requirements, but, you know, make sure the units survived.

1198
01:20:29.68 --> 01:20:33.68
And we didn't, you know, we didn't start losing people, the accidents and things like that.

1199
01:20:33.68 --> 01:20:36.68
And we lost a lot of folks, but all, you know, combat related.

1200
01:20:36.68 --> 01:20:40.68
I did have, you know, I lost one bird on Mount Mass of Colorado.

1201
01:20:40.68 --> 01:20:45.68
We lost four, doing high altitude training for preparing to go into Afghanistan

1202
01:20:45.68 --> 01:20:46.68
when I was a regimental commander.

1203
01:20:46.68 --> 01:20:51.68
So we certainly had our share of accidents, but overall I thought it was, you know,

1204
01:20:51.68 --> 01:20:54.68
there was less than what I was expecting.

1205
01:20:54.68 --> 01:21:02.68
Yeah, you wouldn't think that when, when, you know, after, after desert one, right?

1206
01:21:02.68 --> 01:21:04.68
And they formed J sock.

1207
01:21:04.68 --> 01:21:10.68
They weren't trying to put together a bunch of units that would be on sustained combat operations

1208
01:21:10.68 --> 01:21:11.68
around the world, right?

1209
01:21:11.68 --> 01:21:13.68
This was not the plan.

1210
01:21:13.68 --> 01:21:17.68
No, it was hostage ret, it was short intense ops, and then, you know,

1211
01:21:17.68 --> 01:21:22.68
and then, you know, back home to refit and retraining reset, right?

1212
01:21:22.68 --> 01:21:23.68
It wasn't this.

1213
01:21:23.68 --> 01:21:29.68
So, so taking this group of people and just going, oh, yeah, you're going to go to war.

1214
01:21:29.68 --> 01:21:32.68
Oh, yeah, it's going to last about 20 years, which is what happened.

1215
01:21:32.68 --> 01:21:36.68
It's still, you know, I mean, you know, it's wrapping up there in Afghanistan now,

1216
01:21:36.68 --> 01:21:41.68
but, you know, the ones, you know, I always joked when I'd talked to my counterparts.

1217
01:21:41.68 --> 01:21:46.68
I'd say, you know, we've deployed, we're just still waiting for that redeployment order.

1218
01:21:46.68 --> 01:21:49.68
You know, because of the state we're staying over there.

1219
01:21:49.68 --> 01:21:51.68
So aviation is always there.

1220
01:21:51.68 --> 01:21:58.68
Even the ground units are coming in and out, you know, the, they had more of a predictable cycle, right?

1221
01:21:58.68 --> 01:22:04.68
You got your two-year cycle at NSW and there's George and other cycles that the other units use,

1222
01:22:04.68 --> 01:22:10.68
but because aviation is high demand and low density, I mean, you've got to spread the peanut butter a lot thinner.

1223
01:22:10.68 --> 01:22:13.68
And we were rotating all the time.

1224
01:22:13.68 --> 01:22:17.68
You know, we had two CFI, it's C-17s a month coming out of a camel,

1225
01:22:17.68 --> 01:22:28.68
tree place, you know, combat damage, darecraft and bring aircraft back for maintenance and then rotate people in on them.

1226
01:22:28.68 --> 01:22:32.68
Is that they're going to try and make special operations bigger?

1227
01:22:32.68 --> 01:22:34.68
It certainly doesn't seem that way.

1228
01:22:34.68 --> 01:22:39.68
No, you know, I mean, I had the Rand guys come in and see me when I was the regimental commander.

1229
01:22:39.68 --> 01:22:43.68
It said, hey, there's enough demand for a second regiment.

1230
01:22:43.68 --> 01:22:46.68
And I said, I'm sure there is, but there's no way the army could sustain that.

1231
01:22:46.68 --> 01:22:49.68
I mean, we're a talent thief from Army aviation already.

1232
01:22:49.68 --> 01:22:52.68
You know, you don't get assigned to the 160th, right?

1233
01:22:52.68 --> 01:22:58.68
As a pilot, you have to be, you have to apply and go through an assessment process and get selected.

1234
01:22:58.68 --> 01:23:02.68
And you know, and there's the brigades pay a price for that.

1235
01:23:02.68 --> 01:23:05.68
You know, the aviation brigades in the army, they're losing solid folks.

1236
01:23:05.68 --> 01:23:11.68
Now, the nation gains from that, but, you know, if we double the size of that, there's no way.

1237
01:23:11.68 --> 01:23:13.68
No way they could sustain that.

1238
01:23:13.68 --> 01:23:15.68
It's just the nature of the beast.

1239
01:23:15.68 --> 01:23:23.68
You know, I mean, we're going to be, you know, we're going to be forward and we're going to have to operate at a different off tempo than our,

1240
01:23:23.68 --> 01:23:26.68
than the ground forces we support and it's just a fact of life.

1241
01:23:26.68 --> 01:23:32.68
I accepted a long time ago, understood the realities behind it and never pushed back.

1242
01:23:32.68 --> 01:23:42.68
But because at the end of the day, you know, I'm not going to leave you in an HLZ and that, you know, and I'm not, you know, if you need combat power, we can provide it if it's physically possible.

1243
01:23:42.68 --> 01:23:44.68
We're going to do it.

1244
01:23:44.68 --> 01:23:49.68
So from a leadership perspective, that's like full commanders intent right there.

1245
01:23:49.68 --> 01:23:54.68
Like, hey, we are going to support these guys on the ground, no matter what it takes exactly.

1246
01:23:54.68 --> 01:23:58.68
And, you know, you're great as strength carries over to be your greatest weakness.

1247
01:23:58.68 --> 01:24:04.68
I'm sure that some of my senior officers would say that I was pretty aggressive in that.

1248
01:24:04.68 --> 01:24:06.68
And they would be accurate.

1249
01:24:06.68 --> 01:24:15.68
You know, I, but it was, it was, you know, burned into my psyche early on that, hey, that's why we exist.

1250
01:24:15.68 --> 01:24:19.68
So, and I don't care if the ground force commander is in E6 or no6.

1251
01:24:19.68 --> 01:24:20.68
I don't care.

1252
01:24:20.68 --> 01:24:21.68
Doesn't matter.

1253
01:24:21.68 --> 01:24:23.68
I don't care what uniform he's wearing.

1254
01:24:23.68 --> 01:24:27.68
You know, what services in, I mean, if there are responsibility to support them,

1255
01:24:27.68 --> 01:24:30.68
then we're going to meet that responsibility no matter what.

1256
01:24:30.68 --> 01:24:36.68
And I, you know, I take a lot of pride in that, but we also, you know, we can accept more risk into 160

1257
01:24:36.68 --> 01:24:40.68
because we have a special assessment selection process to get our pilots.

1258
01:24:40.68 --> 01:24:47.68
And our pilots stay with us for, I'm not saying forever, but I'll give you an example.

1259
01:24:47.68 --> 01:24:51.68
When you saw the movie Blackcock Down, and you see that little bird landed in the intersection,

1260
01:24:51.68 --> 01:24:56.68
and they pull out the two wounded operators that get shot on, they were on Super 61.

1261
01:24:56.68 --> 01:25:04.68
So, one of the pilots in there was a guy Carl Meyer, who I went through Green Patoon with an 88 early 88 February.

1262
01:25:04.68 --> 01:25:06.68
That happened in 93, right?

1263
01:25:06.68 --> 01:25:08.68
So, he'd already been in the unit five years.

1264
01:25:08.68 --> 01:25:13.68
He retired like two and a half years ago, or not even two years ago.

1265
01:25:13.68 --> 01:25:14.68
It's from the unit.

1266
01:25:14.68 --> 01:25:18.68
Yeah, and he was still flying MH6 assault birds that whole time.

1267
01:25:18.68 --> 01:25:19.68
So, that's kind of...

1268
01:25:19.68 --> 01:25:20.68
That's pretty awesome.

1269
01:25:20.68 --> 01:25:21.68
That's be like you'd be an on a team.

1270
01:25:21.68 --> 01:25:25.68
I mean, you're going back into a building up, Ben Erdundet, got 100 of these t-shirts.

1271
01:25:25.68 --> 01:25:30.68
You know, that knowledge and that competency and proficiency that you get

1272
01:25:30.68 --> 01:25:34.68
out of being able to retain those pilots, what that really translates to is,

1273
01:25:34.68 --> 01:25:40.68
you know, I'm willing, we're willing to push the envelope on ops.

1274
01:25:40.68 --> 01:25:46.68
Because we know we have that talent, and we rely on those warrants, you know, primarily,

1275
01:25:46.68 --> 01:25:52.68
to, you know, make good decisions, and to push the envelope.

1276
01:25:52.68 --> 01:25:57.68
We had an op up in Mosul area, and they went long, right?

1277
01:25:57.68 --> 01:25:59.68
This is, you know, grand guys doing SSC.

1278
01:25:59.68 --> 01:26:03.68
It went long, and I had to extend them beyond, like, 18 hours,

1279
01:26:03.68 --> 01:26:06.68
flight time, which is a long time.

1280
01:26:06.68 --> 01:26:10.68
And they were taxing back into one of the airfields up there to get gas,

1281
01:26:10.68 --> 01:26:15.68
and one of the MH6Ds clipped the side of a hanger with this rotor blade.

1282
01:26:15.68 --> 01:26:17.68
And it was clearly from fatigue.

1283
01:26:17.68 --> 01:26:21.68
And you know, when we did the accident investigation, I told my boss,

1284
01:26:21.68 --> 01:26:24.68
a three star, I said, I own that.

1285
01:26:24.68 --> 01:26:25.68
And they said, what do you mean?

1286
01:26:25.68 --> 01:26:29.68
I said, look, I know we got to learn lessons from this, but the fact is, I extended them

1287
01:26:29.68 --> 01:26:33.68
well beyond their day, and this was, you know, they weren't flying, you know,

1288
01:26:33.68 --> 01:26:36.68
supplies back and forth, they're doing combat.

1289
01:26:36.68 --> 01:26:37.68
The guys were tired.

1290
01:26:37.68 --> 01:26:40.68
I took the risk, so I own that.

1291
01:26:40.68 --> 01:26:43.68
You know, I mean, we pushed them, and we paid them price.

1292
01:26:43.68 --> 01:26:46.68
I mean, it's a small price, frankly, and I would have done it all over again.

1293
01:26:46.68 --> 01:26:50.68
But so cost a couple hundred grand for a rotor blade.

1294
01:26:50.68 --> 01:26:56.68
But you know, what leadership lessons do you have when you look at yourself as a

1295
01:26:56.68 --> 01:27:01.68
platoon commander in charge of eight birds to batallion commander?

1296
01:27:01.68 --> 01:27:09.68
So first of all, you know, I believe that leadership has learned skill, not a natural skill.

1297
01:27:09.68 --> 01:27:13.68
And that those, the skill sets required at different levels change, right?

1298
01:27:13.68 --> 01:27:15.68
So as a PL, a platoon leader, right?

1299
01:27:15.68 --> 01:27:16.68
It's direct leadership.

1300
01:27:16.68 --> 01:27:21.68
Jocco, follow me, you know, we're going here, we're doing that, right?

1301
01:27:21.68 --> 01:27:30.68
And you and your, uh, troop, um, but as you get more senior, now you got these layers of bureaucracy in between you, right?

1302
01:27:30.68 --> 01:27:39.68
And you know, think back to when you're a young, O1, O2, down on the teams, and you got, you know, that ancient dude who is an O5 up there, right?

1303
01:27:39.68 --> 01:27:43.68
And it was clearly clueless because anybody who's above you is clueless, right?

1304
01:27:43.68 --> 01:27:46.68
That's a, you know, common health belief by all.

1305
01:27:46.68 --> 01:27:51.68
And, and, you know, I just kept learning, you know, so when I was,

1306
01:27:51.68 --> 01:27:56.68
remember I told you I was really worried about chronic fatigue and morale and, you know, families or

1307
01:27:56.68 --> 01:28:00.68
Fran because of what's, of this optempo.

1308
01:28:00.68 --> 01:28:09.68
So that, uh, warrant I was telling you about Carl Meyer who was a little bird driver and his wife, Cindy, who I'm still friends with to this day.

1309
01:28:09.68 --> 01:28:19.68
One day I was walking around the hangar and she said, you know, yada, go spend some time with these young troops, you know, because they want to hear from the batanguander, what's happening, you know?

1310
01:28:19.68 --> 01:28:21.68
And it really resonated with me.

1311
01:28:21.68 --> 01:28:27.68
So I blocked out, and this is a small leadership technique, but it was very effective for me.

1312
01:28:27.68 --> 01:28:32.68
I blocked out two hours a week and I went and I never told anybody where I was going.

1313
01:28:32.68 --> 01:28:33.68
And it wasn't an inspection, right?

1314
01:28:33.68 --> 01:28:38.68
I wasn't coming over there and saying, well, like, why do you got a croaky on your freaking sunglasses?

1315
01:28:38.68 --> 01:28:46.68
It was more, you know, just to sort of get a bird's, you know, a ground view of how things are going.

1316
01:28:46.68 --> 01:28:55.68
And, you know, at first it was quite a, you know, quite a dust up, you know, I'd walk into, you know, a little bird company and, you know, the guys are like, what the hell are you doing down here?

1317
01:28:55.68 --> 01:28:57.68
Well, I said I'm the commander of this outfit.

1318
01:28:57.68 --> 01:28:59.68
I'd like to think I could come down here if I wanted.

1319
01:28:59.68 --> 01:29:02.68
But over time they realized it was no threat.

1320
01:29:02.68 --> 01:29:04.68
I nature, I never chewed anybody's ass and I was down there.

1321
01:29:04.68 --> 01:29:15.68
It wasn't, you know, wasn't about that. If I saw something particularly egregious, I'd go back to the exo and say, hey, go down to, you know, Owen's hanger and police those dudes up on the good cop, you're the bad cop kind of thing.

1322
01:29:15.68 --> 01:29:19.68
But what I would do is spend time with troops and it was very low threat.

1323
01:29:19.68 --> 01:29:25.68
So I get them around, sit around and talk with them, hey, you know, what can I do to make the unit better?

1324
01:29:25.68 --> 01:29:27.68
You know, what do you think about it?

1325
01:29:27.68 --> 01:29:33.68
Are you going, I was a big pusher of off duty education because of my personal background, I knew how powerful it was.

1326
01:29:33.68 --> 01:29:36.68
And so I'd always encourage them about that.

1327
01:29:36.68 --> 01:29:48.68
And I'd look for easy wins, low hanging fruit, you know, like if there was something going on that needed to be fixed, but they were just struggling through, you know, multiple forms and triple good to get some crap done or something.

1328
01:29:48.68 --> 01:29:50.68
Then I was short circuit that.

1329
01:29:50.68 --> 01:29:55.68
You know, I've shared this before with other folks, but one day I was in the engine shop.

1330
01:29:55.68 --> 01:30:00.68
And we were turned an aircraft from combat, the damage and, you know, maintenance.

1331
01:30:00.68 --> 01:30:05.68
I mean, it was really we could barely keep up with what we needed to have down range.

1332
01:30:05.68 --> 01:30:20.68
And I relied on these, you know, young, 18, 19 year old kids that were bore scoping engines and, you know, doing stuff that they had no idea of probably their criticality to us maintaining the right number of aircraft to deploy, but I clearly know.

1333
01:30:20.68 --> 01:30:26.68
So I, you know, I come into their little engine shop this particular time and I call them all in, you know, it's round, you know.

1334
01:30:26.68 --> 01:30:42.68
In fact, Cindy Meyer used to call it Uncle Clay's story, you know, if I'd sit in there and, you know, chat with them, but I'd always ask them, hey, you know, what, what could I do, you know, what can I do to make the unit better, what can I do to make your job easier.

1335
01:30:42.68 --> 01:30:51.68
And this one young E4 said to me, you know, so I'm maxed my Army physical fitness test, the APFT, you know, an Army lingo.

1336
01:30:51.68 --> 01:31:06.68
And he said, but I got to go out and run with like the slowest people out there and formation run, you know, it's a bunch of garbage, you know, why don't we have an incentive P.T. program, which is pretty common, you know, you score above a certain score and you, you know, you can sort of do your own thing.

1337
01:31:06.68 --> 01:31:18.68
And I said, that's a good question. Let me get back at that was about one in the afternoon. So I walked back up to the headquarters, got on an email, sent me a lot to the first sergeants and said, hey, do you have an incentive P.T. program?

1338
01:31:18.68 --> 01:31:33.68
If, you know, if not, why not and should we have one? And they basically all wrote back and said, yeah, look, we've been in combat, we just, that kind of stuff is sort of falling off our radar, we should have one.

1339
01:31:33.68 --> 01:31:40.68
So, you know, I got with the serge major, typed up a policy, you know, the agent more accurately typed it up, I signed it.

1340
01:31:40.68 --> 01:31:54.68
And said, if you get above whatever a 290, it's a possible score 300, you can P.T. on your own. I walked right back down about two hours later to that same dude, you know, specialist, you know, I don't remember his name.

1341
01:31:54.68 --> 01:32:07.68
Hand it on the policy letter and said, hey, thanks, you were right. We should have done this, just fell off our radar, you know, you have changed the Italian policy. Here is our incentive P.T. program.

1342
01:32:07.68 --> 01:32:28.68
You know, of course, that kid, crowed about that, you know, and I mean six months later, I'm hopping on a C-17 pulling a pump over to Iraq and this sergeant, you know, is crawling into my fart sack, you know, getting ready to take my ambient, go to La La land and he, he said, hey, sir, I just want to tell you, you know, that kid still just brags about change in policy.

1343
01:32:28.68 --> 01:32:48.68
But, you know, little things like that, the force responds to that, right? They know you give it down and which I do. And, you know, they know they got a voice. And, of course, I didn't, you know, why can't we have, you know, women in the barracks, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, why can't we run a prostitution ring out here?

1344
01:32:48.68 --> 01:33:02.68
You know, they're not going to get everything, you know, but, you know, I tried to, you know, make sure they understood, they were appreciated. And, you know, that doesn't mean I don't hold the standard, right? I mean, you know, you got to earn the right to be in these units every day.

1345
01:33:02.68 --> 01:33:15.68
And, an an a job for life. But, also, you know, they, they should have faith and confidence in a chain of command that we're going to do the best we can and be transparent as we can. And, you know, I think it worked pretty well.

1346
01:33:15.68 --> 01:33:25.68
How about when you elevated up to then regimental commander? A little harder, right? And it got exponentially harder as a general officer.

1347
01:33:25.68 --> 01:33:35.68
But again, now the bureaucracy increases more and now, you know, as a battalion commander, I'm down and in, right? I mean, I'm dealing with my boss, a regimental commander,

1348
01:33:35.68 --> 01:33:47.68
but really, my focus is combat, right, in my unit. As the regimental commander at the time, I also had a humongous budget. You know, I was the most expensive,

1349
01:33:47.68 --> 01:33:58.68
O6 level command in the army by orders of magnitude, by orders of magnitude. We were also geographically dispersed. I have a battalion up at Fort Lewis, Washington, 416.

1350
01:33:58.68 --> 01:34:09.68
I got a battalion in Savannah, Georgia, 316. You got two battions, operational battions at Fort Campbell, plus a training battalion, plus an R&D outfit.

1351
01:34:09.68 --> 01:34:19.68
I've got guys all over the world. And I'm an O6. So, most of my time, that was the big change. It's now up and out. Now I'm protecting my budget, right?

1352
01:34:19.68 --> 01:34:25.68
Like, I'm the best looking woman at the frapp party. I mean, everybody wants to go out with me. They're trying to steal my cat.

1353
01:34:25.68 --> 01:34:40.68
So, I'm an O6, and I'm dealing with Geos. So, it was much more resource stuff. I'm looking two or three ridge lines down. What do I need to do to make sure that we're adequately resource?

1354
01:34:40.68 --> 01:34:49.68
And that we remain, you know, quoting general or Admiral McCraven. We may not compare it, it may contain that comparative advantage over our adversary. So, that was my focus.

1355
01:34:49.68 --> 01:35:00.68
That was the biggest difference. It wasn't down and it wasn't combat anymore. It was taking care of the regiment down the road and making sure that they had what they needed.

1356
01:35:00.68 --> 01:35:08.68
And that was really this. I mean, that was a great training ground for being a flag officer, because that's exactly what, you know, when you were aiding from a choir,

1357
01:35:08.68 --> 01:35:16.68
I bet most of his stuff was resource stuff, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. That's what you do.

1358
01:35:16.68 --> 01:35:26.68
You do? Man, I'm training money. Yeah, money. Title 10. And, well, I'm sure you know the Navy. The Seal team's doing always do well in that category. So, it's rough sometimes.

1359
01:35:26.68 --> 01:35:34.68
And, like you said, especially when you're going up against the Air Force and just the amount of platforms that they have is freaking rough.

1360
01:35:34.68 --> 01:35:42.68
Yeah. Because they need so much money for each one of those platforms. It's like way more expensive than a boat.

1361
01:35:42.68 --> 01:35:53.68
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Much more. And I think now, though, we're now where we got our, we sort of got our swim lanes, right? So we, you know, we do, we're rotary wing. That's what we do. We do have unmanned. We got, uh,

1362
01:35:53.68 --> 01:35:58.68
Pregraegles, which are basically a predator, you know, improved predator.

1363
01:35:58.68 --> 01:36:04.68
But, you know, we're very focused on what we do, Afsock, very focused on what we do.

1364
01:36:04.68 --> 01:36:12.68
And, you know, going back to my tenure at Afsock as a young captain, those relationships that I built with those Air Force guys,

1365
01:36:12.68 --> 01:36:19.68
really paid huge dividends later, right? Like I, I'm a personal friends with the Air Force Special Ops Commander Jim Slyf, you know,

1366
01:36:19.68 --> 01:36:23.68
I mean, he was a chief of staff. It's so common. I was a three.

1367
01:36:23.68 --> 01:36:29.68
You know, we had, if we have a personal friendship, Scott Howell out of Fort Bragg, we're personal friends. I mean, when I call him and say something,

1368
01:36:29.68 --> 01:36:40.68
there's a trust factor that goes both ways, and it's with numerous other. So I mean, that made my life a lot easier and really broadened my sort of herisances and officer,

1369
01:36:40.68 --> 01:36:47.68
realize it, you know, hey, it really does take a joint force to get this done. And understand the different perspectives, you know.

1370
01:36:47.68 --> 01:36:58.68
Yeah, I was really, my last deployment was in, was in Ramadi and just, I mean, we were, we wouldn't have been able to do anything without the Army and the Marine Corps to have our back.

1371
01:36:58.68 --> 01:37:10.68
Yeah, Q RF, you know, you got stuff, Q RF, Cazovack, just everything that we needed. We needed from those guys. They needed to support us and we needed to support them. It was just an awesome relationship.

1372
01:37:10.68 --> 01:37:15.68
So you get done with that tour, yeah, and then what's next?

1373
01:37:15.68 --> 01:37:25.68
So I had been deferred from the war college like three times. You know, I was supposed to go, you're supposed to go before 06 command as you know, you know, but I never went. I was deferred.

1374
01:37:25.68 --> 01:37:35.68
And so I ended up going after and I made flag office, or while I was in the war college. I mean, I didn't get a nouse because I had to go through all the joint credit stuff, you know.

1375
01:37:35.68 --> 01:37:45.68
And, but I ended up deploying to Afghanistan, is part of, in TMA, National Training Mission Afghanistan.

1376
01:37:45.68 --> 01:37:52.68
And I stood up the Afghan Special Mission Wing to support their Afghan Commandos and the Katehazs.

1377
01:37:52.68 --> 01:37:58.68
Wow, those dudes. And that was another education. So I'm in Kabul.

1378
01:37:58.68 --> 01:38:10.68
And, you know, we stood up this fleet of this unit of MI-17s and ISR birds, you 28 sort of, you know, not with all the high-speed kit that you got on an American bird.

1379
01:38:10.68 --> 01:38:17.68
But fixed wing ISR platforms stood up all the units. Got the funding through DOD.

1380
01:38:17.68 --> 01:38:26.68
And it's still, I mean, it's still banging targets this day. I ran into the unit commander a couple years ago. He was at a conference here or something we got caught up.

1381
01:38:26.68 --> 01:38:40.68
But, I mean, that was another real growing experience, right? Cause it's all about money and I'd have to brief the Pentagon, the Afghan Resource oversight council, you know, why do we buy MI-17s and not American?

1382
01:38:40.68 --> 01:38:53.68
I'm like, well, you said we had to be out here December 14. There's no way I could train them on a new airplane between now and net. So, you know, I'm all about buying American, but, you know, the Russian, the MI's.

1383
01:38:53.68 --> 01:38:55.68
How many birds did they get for there?

1384
01:38:55.68 --> 01:39:10.68
We had a 28, 30 helicopter, 28 were operational, the ministers and everything I always wanted to fly on. So, I bought two extra just to take care of the VIP stuff, which was, you know, we would, you know, as a wicked pain in my ass.

1385
01:39:10.68 --> 01:39:24.68
But, and then we about, I think it was 15, 15 fixed wing birds and we were split across. We had a squadron in conduce. We had a squadron in Helman, and then we had two in Kabul.

1386
01:39:24.68 --> 01:39:41.68
And we did both CT, counterterrorism, and counter narcotics. So, DEA was a player in there and that was actually part of the negotiation, the DEA wanted to make sure that we were still going to hit the DEA target. So, and which we, you know, I gave him my personal guarantee, you know, we're not going to blow that mission off.

1387
01:39:41.68 --> 01:39:47.68
It's really not something military wants to get into, but, you know, we kept that as a primary mission set for them.

1388
01:39:47.68 --> 01:39:58.68
Who's running training for the Afghan pilots? Well, I was interesting, right? I mean, trying to find an Afghan that can read first of all back then, because the schools have been shut down for, you know, what 20 years or so.

1389
01:39:58.68 --> 01:40:05.68
So, we had a core of pilots that have been flying, that have been trained by the Russians that were there a few but not enough.

1390
01:40:05.68 --> 01:40:18.68
So, we ran some of our pilots through UAE. They had some training there that they go over to UAE, or by Abu Dhabi, and they go through, I think it was a rise in flight academy. It's probably still there.

1391
01:40:18.68 --> 01:40:28.68
And then we'd pick them, you know, and it was funny, because the DEA, you know, they're like, you know, they're very worried, understandably so about insider attacks, right?

1392
01:40:28.68 --> 01:40:46.68
So, they came to me one day and said, hey, we got to give these guys a polygraph, and I'm like, okay, well, what are we going to ask them? Because I mean, everybody steals there, right? You know, patronage is part of the deal, right? You know, hey, we'd take my sister to, you know, conduze or whatever, here's 20 bucks.

1393
01:40:46.68 --> 01:40:52.68
I mean, in a US military, that'd be like, you'd be prosecuted for that. Over there, that's just normal.

1394
01:40:52.68 --> 01:41:02.68
So, I'm talking to the DEA guy and I said, so, you know, here's the way I think it needs to go. Okay, Jaco, you want to come to the special mission wing here, put on this little light detector thing,

1395
01:41:02.68 --> 01:41:10.68
they actually had a finger thing, which I think was, I mean, skeptical about that, but it's okay, Jaco, did you steal anything today?

1396
01:41:10.68 --> 01:41:20.68
The answer is yes, did you feel bad about it? And you promise not to steal tomorrow. Okay, you're a go. I mean, it's just a different, I mean, you know, different cultures.

1397
01:41:20.68 --> 01:41:27.68
You know, so we had to, you know, so vetting was a big thing. And then, you know, the insider tax really got worse, you know, later.

1398
01:41:27.68 --> 01:41:36.68
In fact, one of our families was a national guard guy in the S.W.F. that was training with the Rangers. He was a guard guy out of Utah, Brent Taylor,

1399
01:41:36.68 --> 01:41:42.68
Shot and killed, I mean, by an Afghan doing a rock march, pulled out his pistol and shot the dude.

1400
01:41:42.68 --> 01:41:49.68
But, you know, that was a challenge, a human, it's always human talent, right? Humans are more important in hardware. I mean, and it's true.

1401
01:41:49.68 --> 01:42:01.68
You know, getting the right guys, but hey, listen, right after I left, they hit their, did their first NVG, you know, I think it was to the wire or something mission down near J bad.

1402
01:42:01.68 --> 01:42:12.68
I mean, I couldn't have been a pro at those dudes. And they, you know, I get feedback, you know, periodically from folks that they're still, I mean, they're by far the most successful aviation unit over there.

1403
01:42:12.68 --> 01:42:22.68
Yeah, that's outstanding. We had a guy on this podcast, Captain On, who was a, who was a South Vietnamese pilot and flu song missions in awesome.

1404
01:42:22.68 --> 01:42:25.68
I mean, just freaking epic, but he got, he got trained over here.

1405
01:42:25.68 --> 01:42:33.68
Yeah, you know, you got a record probably, right? He got trained over here and then went back over and, um, man, if you get a chance, listen to that one, he's,

1406
01:42:33.68 --> 01:42:47.68
he's, he's a captain and then he eventually made major. He's one of his, as well, his last mission. He was got shot, um, birds going down.

1407
01:42:47.68 --> 01:42:53.68
He's trying to save the bird as he's going down. Everything's on fire.

1408
01:42:53.68 --> 01:43:03.68
The, uh, I guess the yolk, what, what, what is he holding? He's holding the cyclic. Yeah, so he's holding the cyclic. Everything's too hot for him to hold onto.

1409
01:43:03.68 --> 01:43:08.68
You can't hold onto it. So he's got his hands up by his chest.

1410
01:43:08.68 --> 01:43:20.68
And he sees the birds going to crash if he doesn't just grab hold these controls. So he just freaking reaches down, grabs hold the controls, gets the, gets the pilot, gets the aircraft to the ground.

1411
01:43:20.68 --> 01:43:29.68
His hands are just burned beyond anything. And he goes to undo his seat belt and his fingers fall off.

1412
01:43:29.68 --> 01:43:41.68
He goes to undo, but he manages to get it off, you know, hooked on something and get his seat belt off goes to open the door, his, the rest of his other hand, fingers fall off.

1413
01:43:41.68 --> 01:43:55.68
Eventually, gets out of the aircraft, gets away, gets back to friendlies and it up going to hospital, loses both of his hands.

1414
01:43:55.68 --> 01:44:02.68
You know, carries on for a little while, the war ends up in a, in a communist prison camp.

1415
01:44:02.68 --> 01:44:15.68
He gets, you know, can't do, can't do anything. Really, he's got, he doesn't have hands. So they eventually just kind of let him out of the prison camp. And he, he goes on multiple escape attempts trying to get out of there.

1416
01:44:15.68 --> 01:44:19.68
And eventually he does make it out, makes it to America.

1417
01:44:19.68 --> 01:44:23.68
But, um, I'll write the after we're done on right that number down.

1418
01:44:23.68 --> 01:44:27.68
Yeah, definitely. I just subscribe. I'm going to, yeah, I'll definitely look. I'd love to hear.

1419
01:44:27.68 --> 01:44:35.68
Those Kingby pilots over there. Um, this is also guy who was going into a hot LZ where they'd already lost one or two birds.

1420
01:44:35.68 --> 01:44:43.68
And he says, you know, he just takes his leaves his crew chief there, leaves his co pilot. He just takes his gunner.

1421
01:44:43.68 --> 01:44:50.68
Because he's like, hey, we're going in. There's chances aren't looking good. I'm not risking anybody else. We're going.

1422
01:44:50.68 --> 01:44:54.68
Nice. Yeah. Yeah, that's, you don't see that very often.

1423
01:44:54.68 --> 01:44:59.68
Freaking awesome. Spire. Yeah. So you get that stood up. What's next on?

1424
01:44:59.68 --> 01:45:05.68
So then I get, I take command of the Army Special Observation Command of Fort Bragg. I was the second commander.

1425
01:45:05.68 --> 01:45:12.68
Followed the very capable, uh, the, loud, Lieutenant General retired Kevin Mangham. Who was my boss at the regimen. I took over for him there.

1426
01:45:12.68 --> 01:45:15.68
And really, that's a title 10 command. Right.

1427
01:45:15.68 --> 01:45:18.68
Remember I told you I was focused up and out as a regimental commander.

1428
01:45:18.68 --> 01:45:28.68
So the Army leadership recognized that they needed a general officer, the sort of took care of the trained man and a quick stuff and let the regimen really focus on war fighting.

1429
01:45:28.68 --> 01:45:31.68
So I did two years there.

1430
01:45:31.68 --> 01:45:36.68
You know, and really it's like a lot of budget stuff and personnel stuff.

1431
01:45:36.68 --> 01:45:42.68
Then I went to Korea as the DCG of the second infantry division from 14 to 15.

1432
01:45:42.68 --> 01:45:45.68
And that was a blast. How awesome was that? That was.

1433
01:45:45.68 --> 01:45:50.68
I mean, I, I, I family, my wife had just finished her masters and was teaching. My kids.

1434
01:45:50.68 --> 01:45:56.68
One kid was in college. The other ones were in high school. So I said, you know, hey, I'm, you guys, I'll do this year.

1435
01:45:56.68 --> 01:46:02.68
And, you know, I mean, other than not having my family with me, I mean, I was a PT machine.

1436
01:46:02.68 --> 01:46:08.68
And I, you know, you know, Captain Crunchberry and Frick and protein bars and worked out the gym every day.

1437
01:46:08.68 --> 01:46:15.68
And I mean, you know, and dealt with the Koreans learned a lot about, you know, the village ID at up north there, KJU.

1438
01:46:15.68 --> 01:46:20.68
And I mean, it was an awesome awesome tour. I loved it. I loved Korea.

1439
01:46:20.68 --> 01:46:22.68
Love the people there.

1440
01:46:22.68 --> 01:46:30.68
You know, and how awesome is it that you get to go from your entire your career of aviation and then boom, your deputy commander of the second infantry division?

1441
01:46:30.68 --> 01:46:35.68
Yeah, I mean, it was cool. I had a great boss. I mean, you know, and I, I mean, I learned again.

1442
01:46:35.68 --> 01:46:41.68
You know, it's all about the journey, right? There is no destination and leadership. You just continue to learn and get better.

1443
01:46:41.68 --> 01:46:46.68
And you get a lot of failure around that, you know, along the way, which makes you better, ultimately.

1444
01:46:46.68 --> 01:46:54.68
But Korea was broadened my stuff. First of all, I had really spent much time in the conventional military, except for that one battalion, rest time in Sao.

1445
01:46:54.68 --> 01:47:02.68
You know, Saoam like, you know, they're giving me some army report about, you know, readiness and like, so certainly you know about this.

1446
01:47:02.68 --> 01:47:07.68
So I was like, nope. I don't even know what that acronym, you know?

1447
01:47:07.68 --> 01:47:11.68
Yeah, I'm working with out to us here, voice, so the Georgia to step up.

1448
01:47:11.68 --> 01:47:27.68
You know, but you come with that sort of, hey, we can do this and you know, I took more of a focus on the human side, you know, and, you know, build in the unit, doing a lot of leader development stuff and PT and the crap out of them every chance I got, you know.

1449
01:47:27.68 --> 01:47:37.68
So, you know, I mean, it was, it was a blast. And that was a one year tour. One year, yeah, and then I came back. I was the deputy CG, probably, you know, my boss was Tovo.

1450
01:47:37.68 --> 01:47:42.68
Okay. Yes, yeah, he was just breaking all the boss's best boss ever. Yeah.

1451
01:47:42.68 --> 01:47:54.68
So he was the Siege of Sode of Commander when I was in Ramadi. And see, I was in Belad when you were there because I saw Tovo. Mark Irwin was the TF 16 commander then, who's now the CEO of Bardtown, Berben Company by the way.

1452
01:47:54.68 --> 01:47:59.68
I'm not sure how that skill said translated. He makes him kill the Red Bird. I think I do know how that.

1453
01:47:59.68 --> 01:48:08.68
Translate for that. Okay. But anyway, yeah, worked for Tovo for two years and just under two years loved it. Great dude.

1454
01:48:08.68 --> 01:48:15.68
Yeah, he, he, he gave us such incredible support, you know, to my task unit down there in Ramadi.

1455
01:48:15.68 --> 01:48:21.68
You know, it was a, it was a slug fest down there and he knew it. And he just was awesome.

1456
01:48:21.68 --> 01:48:27.68
Was just outstanding. Yeah, Colin said the same thing. You know, funny story about Tovo. Yeah, great sense of humor.

1457
01:48:27.68 --> 01:48:34.68
You know, he sort of a quiet dry sense of humor. And so his aide was this guy, a Carter.

1458
01:48:34.68 --> 01:48:45.68
He will use his last name, but Carter just in case he listens to this podcast. So his, the way our office was laid out is he had an exo was an o5 and then he had an a to was an o4.

1459
01:48:45.68 --> 01:48:57.68
But he worked right outside my desk. And so, you know, great guy Mustang like me was Ranger Regime guy went to West Point and then went SF and, you know, just a stud.

1460
01:48:57.68 --> 01:49:05.68
He's wise a doctor in the Air Force actually. Anyway, so we got a mutually antagonistic relationship, you know, one liners.

1461
01:49:05.68 --> 01:49:16.68
So I started this war between us. So my, my artio, my communicator was a SF guy and his wife was the manager of Victoria secrets in Fayetteville.

1462
01:49:16.68 --> 01:49:25.68
And so he was going on an overseas trip with Tovo. And Tovo had two knee replacements. Every time he went through TSH, I pointed out wanted.

1463
01:49:25.68 --> 01:49:40.68
So we put a, we put a pair of like, I don't know, size 50 thong women's skivies inside of a Carter's coin bag, right? Then we put a throw away on top. So like you're on his day and a half.

1464
01:49:40.68 --> 01:49:45.68
So he opens it up. He's like, oh, you think you're going to get me with these underwear. He doesn't check his coin bag.

1465
01:49:45.68 --> 01:49:57.68
He goes through the Fayetteville international airport there and Tovo's getting wandered the bag goes through the, you know, the X-ray machine. Of course, you know, the TSM was like, hey, we got a check. Yep, just man.

1466
01:49:57.68 --> 01:50:06.68
I'm no, it's my coin bag right in front of Tovo. She pulls out those skivies. And of course he did it was made by the master criminal there.

1467
01:50:06.68 --> 01:50:16.68
So then he starts having Tovo signed these like his command photos and putting him in a frame like with messages, you know, clear, I know him. You're meant to or you know me.

1468
01:50:16.68 --> 01:50:23.68
And he put him in my bookcase, but I didn't have the key to get my shit out of there, right? So I'm like, all right.

1469
01:50:23.68 --> 01:50:31.68
So I have my XO blow up command photo of me like, you know, the drop down ceiling. Oh, you know, they're whatever they're 16 by 16 or something.

1470
01:50:31.68 --> 01:50:42.68
And I put my picture over and put it above the ceiling. I'll love his desk with like a little note, you know, for like three days, I'm sitting in my office and you know, wait for him and I'll be signing a.

1471
01:50:42.68 --> 01:50:53.68
What the, you know, so anyway, you know, we should have been more responsible is you know, senior go foes, but we weren't at least I was just never going to have a good time.

1472
01:50:53.68 --> 01:50:58.68
Yeah, oh yeah, Tovo was definitely the adult leadership. I was the comic relief throughout.

1473
01:50:58.68 --> 01:51:12.68
And then what was after that? So I went to the J3 at Socom. Okay. Yeah, that was March of 17. My wife joined me and the kids. We had to, you know, with finished school year and then they came down and June.

1474
01:51:12.68 --> 01:51:22.68
And you know, there I, again, I didn't know what was next. I was 39 years at that point or, you know, closing in on 40 trying to figure out if you should make a career.

1475
01:51:22.68 --> 01:51:29.68
Well, yeah, you know, I mean, I was still waiting for something to open up and you know, like McDonald's, you're very clean or something.

1476
01:51:29.68 --> 01:51:40.68
And, you know, and you know, General Thomas was a Socom commander at the time and he's now the chairman of the board of the Special Officer Warrior Foundation and my neighbor.

1477
01:51:40.68 --> 01:51:51.68
And he said, hey, I want you to, you know, I'm thinking about moving you to be the chief of staff, you know, and then let's see what happens with a potential thirds are certainly not a lock.

1478
01:51:51.68 --> 01:51:58.68
But, you know, I, I started thinking about that and, you know, I said, hey, look all stay if you need me to stay if you're asking me.

1479
01:51:58.68 --> 01:52:07.68
I think I'm ready to, you're ready to get out. I mean, it'll be close to 41 by the time I, you know, punch out and sort of done, you know.

1480
01:52:07.68 --> 01:52:16.68
And so he, you know, was very gracious and said, yeah, hey, good. You listen, you know, you got your time on the rock and I was like, yeah, like twice over, you know.

1481
01:52:16.68 --> 01:52:32.68
And when I retired there on McDill, my youngest, who's now just finished up a sophomore year at Clemson, was like three months younger than I was when I joined, you know, so, you know, I go in at 17 and I'm out at 58.

1482
01:52:32.68 --> 01:52:42.68
So, how'd you end up at, you know, how'd you end up at the special operations warrior?

1483
01:52:42.68 --> 01:52:52.68
I wasn't on my radar, right? I really didn't know what I was going to do. My figured I'd, you know, be one of those, you know, dudes, you know, trying to sell helicopters to somebody or something.

1484
01:52:52.68 --> 01:53:09.68
But, general brown, who, you know, we discussed before we went live was the chairman of the board of the Special Officer warrior foundation and I didn't know exactly what was going on, but I knew that Joe McGuire had been sort of nmed for that to go to National Counterterrorism Center.

1485
01:53:09.68 --> 01:53:14.68
So that was the last gig when he had, we've, as a deputy, I think, up there before he retired.

1486
01:53:14.68 --> 01:53:23.68
And that was sort of in the works and they asked me, would you be interested, you know, would you be interested, do you have any interest in running a nonprofit?

1487
01:53:23.68 --> 01:53:27.68
And to be honest with you, I hadn't really thought about it, you know.

1488
01:53:27.68 --> 01:53:37.68
And so I, I almost said, no, I think, you know, I'm going to go, I'll do that later, I'll make some money and, you know, then I'll do that.

1489
01:53:37.68 --> 01:53:44.68
But I thought, you know what, you know, just take a look, I said, hey sir, you know, this was not the only thing he talked to about the conversation.

1490
01:53:44.68 --> 01:53:49.68
It was almost like a little sidebar at the end. I said, yeah, I'd like to learn more.

1491
01:53:49.68 --> 01:53:53.68
And I didn't even know it was the S of WF. I just knew it was a nonprofit.

1492
01:53:53.68 --> 01:54:04.68
Because I was in the running, I was a finalist to be the president of the Citadel at the time, which would have been a cool, you know, leader development job, right, which I got ex-doubt by a forced or a graduate, I can't believe it.

1493
01:54:04.68 --> 01:54:13.68
You know, general Walters is doing great there. But then that thing came through with a, for Joe McGuire to go up there.

1494
01:54:13.68 --> 01:54:20.68
And I didn't realize it at the time, but he was a big advocate for me. And I remained grateful to him.

1495
01:54:20.68 --> 01:54:29.68
And I ended up taking over for him. I graduated. I mean, I did my retirement ceremony August 24th of 18 and September 1st.

1496
01:54:29.68 --> 01:54:37.68
And I was wearing my little special S of WF shirt and figure, you know, and figure not out of Panhandle for money, you know.

1497
01:54:37.68 --> 01:54:42.68
So tell us about the mission of the special operations of where you're found to be.

1498
01:54:42.68 --> 01:54:57.68
So, you know, the fourth foundation is just had our 41st anniversary. It was started in Desert 1 when we lost those eight Americans, three Marines, five airmen, left behind 17 kids and there was a commitment by the members of that task force to take care of those kids.

1499
01:54:57.68 --> 01:55:03.68
So that's how we started. And we've evolved over time. Today we have two primary missions.

1500
01:55:03.68 --> 01:55:11.68
We provide immediate financial assistance to severely wounded ill or injured special ops personnel.

1501
01:55:11.68 --> 01:55:20.68
And that comes into form of an overnight check for up to 5K. If another organization like Navy Seal Foundation takes care of their folks.

1502
01:55:20.68 --> 01:55:28.68
And, you know, we work together with them. In fact, I had dinner with the director, Navy Seal Foundation last night, and her husband, who.

1503
01:55:28.68 --> 01:55:35.68
And so we do that. We overnight, a check to them. And that's really put the dog into the county money flying.

1504
01:55:35.68 --> 01:55:44.68
Your mother to watch the kids so you can buy with your loved one. And we also send them a device called the Echo Show, which is sort of like an Alexa with a video capability.

1505
01:55:44.68 --> 01:55:52.68
So they can communicate with their family from the hospital room, they can stream videos, and they're in COVID. That's been a really big hit.

1506
01:55:52.68 --> 01:56:06.68
That's one mission. But our primary mission is a very unique approach to educating the children of fallen special ops personnel and the children of all Medal of Honor recipients, all living and deceased and non-suff.

1507
01:56:06.68 --> 01:56:17.68
Right. So we cover all of that. And our program is we call it cradle to career. It starts in preschool. We fund preschool for up to 8K per year per child.

1508
01:56:17.68 --> 01:56:23.68
We fund unlimited tutoring from that time all the way through college graduation.

1509
01:56:23.68 --> 01:56:35.68
We pay for their college visits. We bring our high school kids about 30 a year or so plus or minus to Tampa for college prep course called epic education preparation information conference.

1510
01:56:35.68 --> 01:56:51.68
We talked about picking a major, picking a school, writing your essay for your common app, financial management, study skills, time management, a lot of leader development stuff, very, very effective.

1511
01:56:51.68 --> 01:57:02.68
We pay for all their college and we don't care if they go to a trade school. You want to be a plumber. You want to be a hairstylist. That's good. We'll fund that.

1512
01:57:02.68 --> 01:57:13.68
If you go to an Ivy, we'll fund that. There is no limitation. It's your passion and potential that will drive where you go and we're going to support you all the way through.

1513
01:57:13.68 --> 01:57:18.68
We have a mentoring program. Keep in mind these are kids in a single parent home.

1514
01:57:18.68 --> 01:57:31.68
You've been through the trauma that goes behind that casualty. That's the real tragedy. It's just unfolding there. We have a mentoring program that starts in eighth grade with these kids.

1515
01:57:31.68 --> 01:57:38.68
Hey, what do you want to be when you grow up, Jocco? If I'm your dad and I'm telling you, you're like, yeah, I'm not listening to you.

1516
01:57:38.68 --> 01:57:51.68
We do that and that continues all the way through helping them secure internships. We pay for study abroad. We pay for internships. We pay a five k-stip and for them to relocate to do an internship.

1517
01:57:51.68 --> 01:57:58.68
We have a special needs program that we got about 25 to 30 kids with varying degrees of special needs.

1518
01:57:58.68 --> 01:58:10.68
I consider special needs kids that have emotional issues associated with the loss of their parent. Not what you would traditionally call special needs, right?

1519
01:58:10.68 --> 01:58:16.68
Because you listen there. There are challenges even in the discipline are as a result of their parent service.

1520
01:58:16.68 --> 01:58:22.68
At least in part, I would say. Not that there's not accountability there because there is. That's part of it, right?

1521
01:58:22.68 --> 01:58:31.68
But we fund that. And you take these kids from preschool. We invest in preschool. Why? Because we've seen that that pays dividends down the road.

1522
01:58:31.68 --> 01:58:42.68
Last year we had 41 kids graduate high school. 38 went right to college to join the military and one took a year off. Well above the national average.

1523
01:58:42.68 --> 01:58:56.68
We had 93% of our kids last year graduate college on time with a degree. And that's consistent and the numbers just get better and better and better. And these are kids that are again single parent home.

1524
01:58:56.68 --> 01:59:05.68
And it's a great mission today. We have 996 kids in the program. The youngest is a just last January was a year old Dustin Art.

1525
01:59:05.68 --> 01:59:12.68
His father Dustin Gabriel Art was a certain first class in third group. He was shot and killed in Afghanistan.

1526
01:59:12.68 --> 01:59:20.68
And I mean our education counselor who are really the tip of the spear for us or six of them said he's class of 242.

1527
01:59:20.68 --> 01:59:29.68
And we make a promise and we say, okay, hey, Dustin, we got you all the way through. You know, you can count on it. We're going to fund that.

1528
01:59:29.68 --> 01:59:41.68
And that's how we do that in accounting and everything that we're going to fund that through. And you know to see these kids reach their full potential after sacrifice and for their country, which they didn't necessarily sign up for.

1529
01:59:41.68 --> 01:59:54.68
I mean to me, it's a great calling and you know, am I, you know, making as much money as I could sell and helicopters and so many probably not, but I look forward to coming to work every day.

1530
01:59:54.68 --> 02:00:05.68
I mean, as I started the whole thing talking about Steve Void and just learning that impact that that the organization has had on him obviously.

1531
02:00:05.68 --> 02:00:12.68
And that, you know, like I was saying earlier, I didn't do anything for Steve Void. You know, I was just framed.

1532
02:00:12.68 --> 02:00:26.68
But the fact, I didn't do anything. I tried to serve the best I could keep him in my mind, but for having an organization that actually steps in and take care of these kids, it's just, it's just outstanding.

1533
02:00:26.68 --> 02:00:39.68
And it's an outstanding organization. And I mean, you know, look at the impact, the mentorship with an eighth grader, like everybody could use that, but especially someone that doesn't have their parent.

1534
02:00:39.68 --> 02:00:52.68
So just an awesome program. I appreciate what you're doing and what your whole team is doing. I know that the, I know people are going to be interested in, you know, in trying to find it. So they can help out.

1535
02:00:52.68 --> 02:00:56.68
I know it's a special ops dot org. That's correct. Is the website.

1536
02:00:56.68 --> 02:01:10.68
Instagram is soft warrior fund FND. Twitter is soft warrior fund FND. So it's S.O.F. warrior FND. Facebook is at warrior foundation.

1537
02:01:10.68 --> 02:01:16.68
And you also actually have a YouTube channel, which is special operations warrior foundation.

1538
02:01:16.68 --> 02:01:21.68
I mean, I think this is a good place to wrap it up. You got anything? No, sir. My pleasure.

1539
02:01:21.68 --> 02:01:29.68
You know, same here guys. I really appreciate the time. And I just got to tell you, you know, I didn't know ahead of time. You were going to tell that story and read that letter.

1540
02:01:29.68 --> 02:01:39.68
But that was really awesome. I mean, you know, and to me, you, you get it. You know what we're doing and why we're doing it. And I really appreciate you sharing that.

1541
02:01:39.68 --> 02:01:45.68
Yeah, I was tempted to do it in Steve's voice, which would have been like this, man.

1542
02:01:45.68 --> 02:01:55.68
I had the most epic voice. I wish you could hear it one more time, man. Clay, thanks for coming on. Thanks for sharing your story with us.

1543
02:01:55.68 --> 02:02:00.68
More important. Thanks for your service. Thanks for your service in the Marine Corps.

1544
02:02:00.68 --> 02:02:12.68
We're all in the Army and special operations. And most important. Thanks for the service that you continue to provide for the entire special operations community.

1545
02:02:12.68 --> 02:02:34.68
Thank you for taking care of our brothers and sisters and arms. I'm always a smile on our pleasure and, you know, again, I'm a small part of the team, but there's a whole group of committed folks at the SOWF are very small, but 100% committed to the success of these families and being there for them. You know, so it's an honor.

1546
02:02:34.68 --> 02:02:38.68
Thanks for the support.

1547
02:02:38.68 --> 02:02:45.68
And with that general clay hot marker has left the building in once again.

1548
02:02:45.68 --> 02:02:52.68
Echo Charles seems like we can do more. And at a minimum, it seems like we can do better.

1549
02:02:52.68 --> 02:02:57.68
Better. Yeah. What can we do to do better? Well, we can do a lot for sure.

1550
02:02:57.68 --> 02:03:05.68
You know, not all of us are going to be flying through biblical dust storms. Just save people, support people. Not all of us.

1551
02:03:05.68 --> 02:03:11.68
Those those dust storms are crazy. Yes, sir. You don't want to be in one. Yeah.

1552
02:03:11.68 --> 02:03:16.68
Find a helicopter. I'm not sure. I imagine that that is true.

1553
02:03:16.68 --> 02:03:24.68
But in the event of us trying to support others, we need to be as capable as possible. We'll just say that.

1554
02:03:24.68 --> 02:03:31.68
Let's say you do for whatever reason have to go through a dust storm in any situation in scenario. How can we be more ready for that?

1555
02:03:31.68 --> 02:03:36.68
Well, let's start with physical physical capability as much as you can.

1556
02:03:36.68 --> 02:03:40.68
Can't just start neglecting your physical capability. So we're working out.

1557
02:03:40.68 --> 02:03:44.68
We're doing you did too, hopefully. So big deal.

1558
02:03:44.68 --> 02:03:49.68
I feel like we've slacked on making it a big deal as it needs to be made.

1559
02:03:49.68 --> 02:03:57.68
It should be, it is a big deal. I think so too. So through our workouts exercising, we're reading hopefully.

1560
02:03:57.68 --> 02:04:02.68
Some people slack on that. You gotta be honest. Not this guy. Not really.

1561
02:04:02.68 --> 02:04:06.68
I'm pretty ridiculous. Yeah. But you know what? Right now, I seem to be.

1562
02:04:06.68 --> 02:04:12.68
I've you ever heard that thing when you're mining your mining and you had a vein of like gold.

1563
02:04:12.68 --> 02:04:13.68
There you go.

1564
02:04:13.68 --> 02:04:14.68
There you go.

1565
02:04:14.68 --> 02:04:21.68
I'm like, I like hate a vein with reading. I'm just starting to get these books that are just stacking up and each one.

1566
02:04:21.68 --> 02:04:24.68
I'm reading. I'll like open one with this one's about.

1567
02:04:24.68 --> 02:04:29.68
I'm going to start going as a vein. I just find a vein. So that fear that I want.

1568
02:04:29.68 --> 02:04:34.68
I don't know if that fear when we started this podcast. I was like, yeah, I probably got ten fifteen books to cover.

1569
02:04:34.68 --> 02:04:38.68
We'll be good. Boy was I wrong.

1570
02:04:38.68 --> 02:04:40.68
Boy was I wrong.

1571
02:04:40.68 --> 02:04:42.68
Yep. So yes.

1572
02:04:42.68 --> 02:04:45.68
So we're reading. So we're reading, working out physical mental, all that stuff.

1573
02:04:45.68 --> 02:04:48.68
Moral too, by the way. But that's one other story.

1574
02:04:48.68 --> 02:04:50.68
Just start with physical mental defense.

1575
02:04:50.68 --> 02:04:55.68
We're going to help us out with our moral and spiritual.

1576
02:04:55.68 --> 02:04:58.68
Maybe health at this time? Maybe not at this time.

1577
02:04:58.68 --> 02:04:59.68
Okay.

1578
02:04:59.68 --> 02:05:03.68
We're sticking with physical. So through physical development, we might need some supplementation.

1579
02:05:03.68 --> 02:05:04.68
It helps.

1580
02:05:04.68 --> 02:05:05.68
Don't worry.

1581
02:05:05.68 --> 02:05:07.68
Jocco has supplementation for us.

1582
02:05:07.68 --> 02:05:08.68
Jocco fuel.

1583
02:05:08.68 --> 02:05:11.68
You know, I was about to commit a sin the other day.

1584
02:05:11.68 --> 02:05:12.68
What?

1585
02:05:12.68 --> 02:05:13.68
Cracked open a discipline. Go.

1586
02:05:13.68 --> 02:05:15.68
I know. I stayed on the straight narrow path.

1587
02:05:15.68 --> 02:05:18.68
My spiritual health was strength.

1588
02:05:18.68 --> 02:05:19.68
But that's not a sin.

1589
02:05:19.68 --> 02:05:21.68
It's a word good. I don't get it. That's not a sin.

1590
02:05:21.68 --> 02:05:22.68
Is it?

1591
02:05:22.68 --> 02:05:24.68
I said I was about to commit a sin.

1592
02:05:24.68 --> 02:05:26.68
Oh, and instead of committing the sin.

1593
02:05:26.68 --> 02:05:31.68
And then I cracked open a discipline go and I was able to get back on.

1594
02:05:31.68 --> 02:05:33.68
Yeah, you're set free.

1595
02:05:33.68 --> 02:05:34.68
On the righteous path.

1596
02:05:34.68 --> 02:05:34.68
Right.

1597
02:05:34.68 --> 02:05:35.68
Just that.

1598
02:05:35.68 --> 02:05:36.68
Boom.

1599
02:05:36.68 --> 02:05:37.68
Spiritual health.

1600
02:05:37.68 --> 02:05:38.68
Yeah.

1601
02:05:38.68 --> 02:05:39.68
I think we could, you know, it's important.

1602
02:05:39.68 --> 02:05:40.68
There you go.

1603
02:05:40.68 --> 02:05:41.68
It's important.

1604
02:05:41.68 --> 02:05:42.68
Guaranteed.

1605
02:05:42.68 --> 02:05:42.68
Yes.

1606
02:05:42.68 --> 02:05:44.68
So discipline go.

1607
02:05:44.68 --> 02:05:45.68
You mentioned.

1608
02:05:45.68 --> 02:05:48.68
Can you can discipline be in a can?

1609
02:05:48.68 --> 02:05:50.68
Can you just have a can of discipline?

1610
02:05:50.68 --> 02:05:52.68
Well, actually, factually, there you go.

1611
02:05:52.68 --> 02:05:53.68
I'm drinking it right now.

1612
02:05:53.68 --> 02:05:55.68
Okay. So instead of this, okay.

1613
02:05:55.68 --> 02:06:01.68
Disciplingo in a can is for us, those of us who are kind of down for the energy drink situation,

1614
02:06:01.68 --> 02:06:06.68
but we're not down with a stigma or what that energy drink situation might entail.

1615
02:06:06.68 --> 02:06:10.68
Doesn't deal from time from for the most part.

1616
02:06:10.68 --> 02:06:11.68
Not anymore, though.

1617
02:06:11.68 --> 02:06:12.68
No. We're good.

1618
02:06:12.68 --> 02:06:13.68
Yes.

1619
02:06:13.68 --> 02:06:16.68
So the energy healthy after you drink it, you're actually better off.

1620
02:06:16.68 --> 02:06:19.68
You're messing trying to pull you off topic and you just bring it right back.

1621
02:06:19.68 --> 02:06:21.68
Well, for you, I need look, these topics.

1622
02:06:21.68 --> 02:06:22.68
I'm not saying are unimportant.

1623
02:06:22.68 --> 02:06:24.68
The ones that you're bringing up or whatever.

1624
02:06:24.68 --> 02:06:26.68
And that they're just for another time.

1625
02:06:26.68 --> 02:06:27.68
Yeah.

1626
02:06:27.68 --> 02:06:29.68
So we're talking about discipline going, you know.

1627
02:06:29.68 --> 02:06:32.68
Also, discipline go is also in other formats.

1628
02:06:32.68 --> 02:06:34.68
Powder.

1629
02:06:34.68 --> 02:06:36.68
Capsules.

1630
02:06:36.68 --> 02:06:37.68
Capsules.

1631
02:06:37.68 --> 02:06:37.68
Yeah.

1632
02:06:37.68 --> 02:06:38.68
So those are good.

1633
02:06:38.68 --> 02:06:42.68
When you're rolling into something, you got to speak.

1634
02:06:42.68 --> 02:06:45.68
You got to make something happen. You're going to be.

1635
02:06:45.68 --> 02:06:48.68
You're going to be having to think on your feet, boom.

1636
02:06:48.68 --> 02:06:49.68
Yeah.

1637
02:06:49.68 --> 02:06:53.68
So it's a, it's a, all formats. It's mental. It's a mind boost.

1638
02:06:53.68 --> 02:06:54.68
Hmm.

1639
02:06:54.68 --> 02:06:55.68
Same saying. So yeah, boom.

1640
02:06:55.68 --> 02:06:57.68
Some people drink energy drinks out of habit.

1641
02:06:57.68 --> 02:07:00.68
Some people drink energy drinks out of, oh, I just need the little bit of caffeine or whatever.

1642
02:07:00.68 --> 02:07:02.68
All that's part of the game, too.

1643
02:07:02.68 --> 02:07:07.68
But this one gives you an actual mental cognitive boost and physical

1644
02:07:07.68 --> 02:07:12.68
boom. So yeah, get down instead of your whack poison is a spiritual boost.

1645
02:07:12.68 --> 02:07:15.68
Well, you know, you know, that's again. That's a whole dog.

1646
02:07:15.68 --> 02:07:21.68
And about also we got health supplementations or supplementation for physical.

1647
02:07:21.68 --> 02:07:24.68
So we got joint warfare for your joints. Keep them in the game.

1648
02:07:24.68 --> 02:07:27.68
Don't even have to worry about them anymore. Also super krill oil.

1649
02:07:27.68 --> 02:07:30.68
There's a lot of studies. I'm not going to say the studies.

1650
02:07:30.68 --> 02:07:34.68
A lot of studies that prove the benefits of krill oil.

1651
02:07:34.68 --> 02:07:41.68
Yeah, you know what's crazy is the subscription rates on krill oil and joint warfare at

1652
02:07:41.68 --> 02:07:43.68
Jocquafuel.

1653
02:07:43.68 --> 02:07:44.68
They're awesome.

1654
02:07:44.68 --> 02:07:44.68
Yeah.

1655
02:07:44.68 --> 02:07:47.68
Because people get them and they're like, oh, yeah, subscribe.

1656
02:07:47.68 --> 02:07:49.68
Yeah, you will feel it. Yeah.

1657
02:07:49.68 --> 02:07:50.68
It's just part of the routine now.

1658
02:07:50.68 --> 02:07:52.68
Because yeah, we don't like worrying about our joints.

1659
02:07:52.68 --> 02:07:56.68
And here's the thing. If you have stay. If you're, if your bedroom is upstairs,

1660
02:07:56.68 --> 02:07:59.68
and you wake up in the morning and you got to walk down stairs,

1661
02:07:59.68 --> 02:08:02.68
and when you wake up, that's when you're the most stiff arguably.

1662
02:08:02.68 --> 02:08:06.68
You're going to feel the difference from day to day. If you're on the super krill oil

1663
02:08:06.68 --> 02:08:09.68
and joint warfare, that's the best combo. My opinion.

1664
02:08:09.68 --> 02:08:13.68
Our opinion will just say general consensus, best combination.

1665
02:08:13.68 --> 02:08:16.68
You're going to feel the difference if your on it versus not on it.

1666
02:08:16.68 --> 02:08:19.68
When you're walking down the stairs in the morning, that's the time you're going to

1667
02:08:19.68 --> 02:08:21.68
really feel it. Not to mention when you're lifting, but, you know,

1668
02:08:21.68 --> 02:08:23.68
of course, a whole lot of other things.

1669
02:08:23.68 --> 02:08:29.68
Also, for your immunity, vitamin D3 and cold war, two options for immunity.

1670
02:08:29.68 --> 02:08:35.68
Boom. Also, supplemental protein. In the form of a dessert, best tasting protein.

1671
02:08:35.68 --> 02:08:42.68
Mix on the market. I kind of went. I hadn't had any mint chocolate for a while.

1672
02:08:42.68 --> 02:08:48.68
Probably like two weeks. Because I just been just been dialing in the peanut butter.

1673
02:08:48.68 --> 02:08:52.68
Yeah. Which is, let's face it. The peanut butter is just freaking delicious.

1674
02:08:52.68 --> 02:08:55.68
I'm facing that fully. Yeah. But then last night,

1675
02:08:55.68 --> 02:09:02.68
for my dessert after I had chicken thighs. That my son cooked on the trigger.

1676
02:09:02.68 --> 02:09:06.68
They might have been the best chicken I've ever had. Think about that.

1677
02:09:06.68 --> 02:09:09.68
I believe in a lot of chicken. That might have been the best chicken.

1678
02:09:09.68 --> 02:09:14.68
And it was just him and me. And so we just were standing there eating.

1679
02:09:14.68 --> 02:09:19.68
Like, put it's whatever. We're just standing there. He's got a big, big,

1680
02:09:19.68 --> 02:09:26.68
big, big, tray full of chicken thighs. And which is what it's eating it. And I eat it.

1681
02:09:26.68 --> 02:09:30.68
And I ate. And it was delicious. I ate a bunch. But guess what I wanted when I was done.

1682
02:09:30.68 --> 02:09:34.68
dessert. I wanted dessert. I wanted dessert.

1683
02:09:34.68 --> 02:09:39.68
And I said, well, no butter. Wait. I could be wrong. Peanut butter and chicken.

1684
02:09:39.68 --> 02:09:44.68
This seems weird, right? It's kind of weird. Anyways, this, the way this chicken was cooked,

1685
02:09:44.68 --> 02:09:49.68
peanut butter wasn't going to be the thing. I went back old school back to my roots.

1686
02:09:49.68 --> 02:09:54.68
And chocolate chip that was good to go. Perfect. Right on the side.

1687
02:09:54.68 --> 02:09:59.68
So good. So freaking good. So this is Nobel Prize. Be little.

1688
02:09:59.68 --> 02:10:03.68
We be little who formulated these things. No, put it together.

1689
02:10:03.68 --> 02:10:08.68
I think I'm thinking Nobel Prize Nobel. What, what, no, well, Nobel, eat Nobel, eat prize.

1690
02:10:08.68 --> 02:10:10.68
I don't know. He's president. Not peace.

1691
02:10:10.68 --> 02:10:14.68
It brings peace. Let's face it. I brought peace to me last night.

1692
02:10:14.68 --> 02:10:18.68
Well, boy, does your boy have a recipe for your, uh, I will find out.

1693
02:10:18.68 --> 02:10:22.68
I will find out. And there could be luck involved because it's face it. You know, it was that good.

1694
02:10:22.68 --> 02:10:25.68
Where you say, man, if you could duplicate this tomorrow, I'd be impressed.

1695
02:10:25.68 --> 02:10:27.68
One night, I'm really impressed. Two nights now.

1696
02:10:27.68 --> 02:10:28.68
Yeah.

1697
02:10:28.68 --> 02:10:30.68
You have a situation you open a restaurant.

1698
02:10:30.68 --> 02:10:31.68
It's interesting.

1699
02:10:31.68 --> 02:10:33.68
I have a chicken thigh recipe too.

1700
02:10:33.68 --> 02:10:35.68
Chicken thighs are just good to go.

1701
02:10:35.68 --> 02:10:40.68
Yes. Yeah. You, you, you do start ahead of the game with the thighs in my opinion too.

1702
02:10:40.68 --> 02:10:43.68
Some people don't prefer that. I do. Obviously, you do too, but I got a recipe too.

1703
02:10:43.68 --> 02:10:45.68
That's why it interests me. Okay.

1704
02:10:45.68 --> 02:10:46.68
Very interested to see this.

1705
02:10:46.68 --> 02:10:47.68
Go ahead ahead.

1706
02:10:47.68 --> 02:10:48.68
Let's have a little cook off.

1707
02:10:48.68 --> 02:10:51.68
And then you have the milk for the, you know, you want any dessert with that?

1708
02:10:51.68 --> 02:10:52.68
Yeah, I do.

1709
02:10:52.68 --> 02:10:53.68
I want the milk right now.

1710
02:10:53.68 --> 02:10:54.68
Yes.

1711
02:10:54.68 --> 02:10:57.68
So yes, these, uh, items.

1712
02:10:57.68 --> 02:11:00.68
This supplementation is available at jockelfuel.com.

1713
02:11:00.68 --> 02:11:02.68
But if you want to go online, you don't have to shop online.

1714
02:11:02.68 --> 02:11:06.68
Go to wall, wall, boom. Actually, wall is just for the energy.

1715
02:11:06.68 --> 02:11:07.68
Just for that.

1716
02:11:07.68 --> 02:11:10.68
If you want the rest of the stuff, you can get a vitamin shop.

1717
02:11:10.68 --> 02:11:14.68
And if you want to get this stuff delivered to your house for free.

1718
02:11:14.68 --> 02:11:16.68
Well, how is it going to get there for free?

1719
02:11:16.68 --> 02:11:18.68
We're going to have to pay some, no.

It'll come there for free.

1725
02:11:29.68 --> 02:11:31.68
How freaking legit is that.

1726
02:11:31.68 --> 02:11:36.68
That's that's the we can do competition with the elephant in the room.

1727
02:11:36.68 --> 02:11:37.68
Right.

1728
02:11:37.68 --> 02:11:40.68
The elephant in the room got some weight behind it.

1729
02:11:40.68 --> 02:11:40.68
Yeah.

1730
02:11:40.68 --> 02:11:42.68
But we're over here, scrapping.

1731
02:11:42.68 --> 02:11:43.68
We're over here, scrapping.

1732
02:11:43.68 --> 02:11:45.68
Oh, you want to throw down some free shipping?

1733
02:11:45.68 --> 02:11:47.68
Watch this.

1734
02:11:47.68 --> 02:11:49.68
Yeah, there is a support.

1735
02:11:49.68 --> 02:11:52.68
Something very secure about a free shipping scenario.

1736
02:11:52.68 --> 02:11:55.68
It's like one of those things you just don't have to worry about.

1737
02:11:55.68 --> 02:11:56.68
I don't know.

1738
02:11:56.68 --> 02:11:57.68
Goes deep.

1739
02:11:57.68 --> 02:11:59.68
Also, origin main.com.

1740
02:11:59.68 --> 02:12:01.68
There's American made stuff.

1741
02:12:01.68 --> 02:12:03.68
Good durable goods as it's called.

1742
02:12:03.68 --> 02:12:05.68
I didn't quite know what that meant.

1743
02:12:05.68 --> 02:12:07.68
Just sounded durable, which I like of course.

1744
02:12:07.68 --> 02:12:08.68
But it's like jeans.

1745
02:12:08.68 --> 02:12:09.68
American made denim.

1746
02:12:09.68 --> 02:12:11.68
We got some hoodie's on there.

1747
02:12:11.68 --> 02:12:12.68
We got some shirts on there.

1748
02:12:12.68 --> 02:12:14.68
We got some jiu-jitsu stuff on there.

1749
02:12:14.68 --> 02:12:16.68
No, when they say American made,

1750
02:12:16.68 --> 02:12:17.68
this is from the cotton.

1751
02:12:17.68 --> 02:12:20.68
That's a grown in South Carolina.

1752
02:12:20.68 --> 02:12:21.68
Where's it North Carolina?

1753
02:12:21.68 --> 02:12:22.68
The Carolina.

1754
02:12:22.68 --> 02:12:23.68
It's in America.

1755
02:12:23.68 --> 02:12:25.68
Tell you that actual hot deceit.

1756
02:12:25.68 --> 02:12:26.68
It's actually different.

1757
02:12:26.68 --> 02:12:28.68
It's actually multiple locations where the cotton is grown.

1758
02:12:28.68 --> 02:12:29.68
Both locations.

1759
02:12:29.68 --> 02:12:30.68
In America.

1760
02:12:30.68 --> 02:12:31.68
Yes.

1761
02:12:31.68 --> 02:12:32.68
Boom.

1762
02:12:32.68 --> 02:12:33.68
All the way up and at the end of the chain,

1763
02:12:33.68 --> 02:12:34.68
you got a jiu-jitsu geek.

1764
02:12:34.68 --> 02:12:36.68
You got some denim jeans.

1765
02:12:36.68 --> 02:12:38.68
Made 100% grown in zone.

1766
02:12:38.68 --> 02:12:40.68
In America.

1767
02:12:40.68 --> 02:12:42.68
Same thing with the boots.

1768
02:12:42.68 --> 02:12:44.68
By the way, rift ghee.

1769
02:12:44.68 --> 02:12:45.68
The rift ghee.

1770
02:12:45.68 --> 02:12:49.68
It is another format of clothing.

1771
02:12:49.68 --> 02:12:53.68
I don't know what else to make with that thing.

1772
02:12:53.68 --> 02:12:56.68
But that material that the rift ghee is.

1773
02:12:56.68 --> 02:13:00.68
If you wear a rift ghee, you will not.

1774
02:13:00.68 --> 02:13:03.68
You look you may wear another ghee at some point because you have to.

1775
02:13:03.68 --> 02:13:05.68
But you won't be happy about it.

1776
02:13:05.68 --> 02:13:07.68
That rift ghee is a freaking legit.

1777
02:13:07.68 --> 02:13:08.68
I don't know what else to make.

1778
02:13:08.68 --> 02:13:10.68
What else can we make with that?

1779
02:13:10.68 --> 02:13:13.68
Well, we could go deep into makes and shorts with that.

1780
02:13:13.68 --> 02:13:16.68
Make a casual jacket or some sort.

1781
02:13:16.68 --> 02:13:19.68
I was thinking like, you know, when you go to, you go to Mexico.

1782
02:13:19.68 --> 02:13:23.68
And you get one of the, you know, like that little barh-h jacket thing.

1783
02:13:23.68 --> 02:13:24.68
You know what I'm talking about?

1784
02:13:24.68 --> 02:13:25.68
Oh, yes.

1785
02:13:25.68 --> 02:13:26.68
It's like a pillow.

1786
02:13:26.68 --> 02:13:27.68
It's like a, yeah.

1787
02:13:27.68 --> 02:13:28.68
Maybe one of those.

1788
02:13:28.68 --> 02:13:29.68
Maybe.

1789
02:13:29.68 --> 02:13:30.68
Yeah, it's possible.

1790
02:13:30.68 --> 02:13:31.68
Yeah.

1791
02:13:31.68 --> 02:13:32.68
That'd be dope.

1792
02:13:32.68 --> 02:13:33.68
I think there's a lot of options.

1793
02:13:33.68 --> 02:13:36.68
Just given the, yeah, the fabric, the whole thing.

1794
02:13:36.68 --> 02:13:38.68
Because the thing is that it catch 22.

1795
02:13:38.68 --> 02:13:41.68
And I often don't think about this.

1796
02:13:41.68 --> 02:13:43.68
Not under important circumstances.

1797
02:13:43.68 --> 02:13:48.68
Just wondering, is it a catch 22 to have a comfort like that for you?

1798
02:13:48.68 --> 02:13:50.68
It's not quite austere, is it?

1799
02:13:50.68 --> 02:13:53.68
Hmm, it's a good point.

1800
02:13:53.68 --> 02:13:56.68
But we are highly focused on capability, right?

1801
02:13:56.68 --> 02:13:57.68
Oh, that's true.

1802
02:13:57.68 --> 02:13:58.68
Yeah.

1803
02:13:58.68 --> 02:14:00.68
So not only does it comfortable.

1804
02:14:00.68 --> 02:14:03.68
It's also highly capable.

1805
02:14:03.68 --> 02:14:06.68
Because you go to wash a regular ghee.

1806
02:14:06.68 --> 02:14:09.68
And then you dry it out takes nine days in the dryer to dry it out.

1807
02:14:09.68 --> 02:14:10.68
A regular ghee.

1808
02:14:10.68 --> 02:14:12.68
This thing's this is dry in 14 minutes.

1809
02:14:12.68 --> 02:14:13.68
No.

1810
02:14:13.68 --> 02:14:14.68
It's functionality, bro.

1811
02:14:14.68 --> 02:14:20.68
It's not about comfort back off functionality and sustainability in the field.

1812
02:14:20.68 --> 02:14:24.68
Yeah.

1813
02:14:24.68 --> 02:14:26.68
But what if the, what if you got a regular ghee on and then you're rolling, it's hard.

1814
02:14:26.68 --> 02:14:28.68
You're rolling with somebody, but I don't know, harder than you.

1815
02:14:28.68 --> 02:14:29.68
They go harder than you.

1816
02:14:29.68 --> 02:14:30.68
They're better than you.

1817
02:14:30.68 --> 02:14:30.68
Whatever.

1818
02:14:30.68 --> 02:14:31.68
They have more skills.

1819
02:14:31.68 --> 02:14:33.68
And that ghee is rubbing against your neck.

1820
02:14:33.68 --> 02:14:34.68
Not even in the submission.

1821
02:14:34.68 --> 02:14:36.68
Just rubbing against your neck.

1822
02:14:36.68 --> 02:14:38.68
Versus the riff ghee.

1823
02:14:38.68 --> 02:14:39.68
Not rubbing against your neck.

1824
02:14:39.68 --> 02:14:40.68
Or it could be rubbing against your neck.

1825
02:14:40.68 --> 02:14:41.68
You don't feel that kind of stuff.

1826
02:14:41.68 --> 02:14:42.68
But as a field bad.

1827
02:14:42.68 --> 02:14:44.68
You two focus on your defense, right?

1828
02:14:44.68 --> 02:14:45.68
It's the same.

1829
02:14:45.68 --> 02:14:46.68
So I get it.

1830
02:14:46.68 --> 02:14:47.68
You're right.

1831
02:14:47.68 --> 02:14:48.68
Okay.

1832
02:14:48.68 --> 02:14:49.68
So your weapons are, yes.

1833
02:14:49.68 --> 02:14:51.68
So you have boots, t-shirts.

1834
02:14:51.68 --> 02:14:53.68
Got an origin USA.com as what we're saying.

1835
02:14:53.68 --> 02:14:54.68
Yes, sure.

1836
02:14:54.68 --> 02:14:55.68
Get cool stuff.

1837
02:14:55.68 --> 02:14:56.68
Some things.

1838
02:14:56.68 --> 02:14:57.68
Speaking of cool stuff.

1839
02:14:57.68 --> 02:14:59.68
Jocco has a store called Jocco's store.

1840
02:14:59.68 --> 02:15:01.68
Cool name, cool stuff.

1841
02:15:01.68 --> 02:15:03.68
This one equals freedom shirts.

1842
02:15:03.68 --> 02:15:04.68
Hats.

1843
02:15:04.68 --> 02:15:06.68
Who it is?

1844
02:15:06.68 --> 02:15:07.68
Some soap on there.

1845
02:15:07.68 --> 02:15:08.68
Where your kid soap?

1846
02:15:08.68 --> 02:15:09.68
Jocco soap?

1847
02:15:09.68 --> 02:15:10.68
Trooper soap?

1848
02:15:10.68 --> 02:15:11.68
Killer soap?

1849
02:15:11.68 --> 02:15:11.68
Mm.

1850
02:15:11.68 --> 02:15:16.68
The black charcoal activated anti bacterial soap.

1851
02:15:16.68 --> 02:15:18.68
Have you ever seen those videos?

1852
02:15:18.68 --> 02:15:21.68
Like on social media or whatever?

1853
02:15:21.68 --> 02:15:25.68
And they're just under the broad topic of satisfying.

1854
02:15:25.68 --> 02:15:26.68
Yeah.

1855
02:15:26.68 --> 02:15:27.68
We're seeing these things.

1856
02:15:27.68 --> 02:15:31.68
I don't watch those videos, but I, my daughters will watch, quote,

1857
02:15:31.68 --> 02:15:33.68
Satisfying videos.

1858
02:15:33.68 --> 02:15:34.68
Right.

1859
02:15:34.68 --> 02:15:38.68
It's like a piece of gelo getting sliced.

1860
02:15:38.68 --> 02:15:39.68
It's real weird stuff, right?

1861
02:15:39.68 --> 02:15:40.68
Yeah.

1862
02:15:40.68 --> 02:15:41.68
I don't get it.

1863
02:15:41.68 --> 02:15:46.68
But the closest thing I have is when you take a black soap,

1864
02:15:46.68 --> 02:15:52.68
which is killer soap, you wouldn't think that you could clean yourself with black soap.

1865
02:15:52.68 --> 02:15:53.68
Yeah.

1866
02:15:53.68 --> 02:15:54.68
But it works.

1867
02:15:54.68 --> 02:15:54.68
Yeah.

1868
02:15:54.68 --> 02:15:56.68
It's so satisfying.

1869
02:15:56.68 --> 02:15:57.68
Good.

1870
02:15:57.68 --> 02:15:59.68
I do understand.

1871
02:15:59.68 --> 02:16:02.68
And yeah, everyone's at all, you come across something.

1872
02:16:02.68 --> 02:16:03.68
Like, yeah, that is.

1873
02:16:03.68 --> 02:16:05.68
I guess, given what you're saying is for satisfying those.

1874
02:16:05.68 --> 02:16:06.68
Yeah.

1875
02:16:06.68 --> 02:16:07.68
It's true.

1876
02:16:07.68 --> 02:16:12.68
And yes, the killer soap experience, we'll say, does fall under that category.

1877
02:16:12.68 --> 02:16:14.68
It kind of has a, what do you call it?

1878
02:16:14.68 --> 02:16:16.68
It's not abrasive.

1879
02:16:16.68 --> 02:16:18.68
What's the less of, or what do you call it?

1880
02:16:18.68 --> 02:16:23.68
It's exfoliation or, I don't know, it's something in there that provides a little scrub.

1881
02:16:23.68 --> 02:16:24.68
There you go.

1882
02:16:24.68 --> 02:16:27.68
So this guy would be exfoliation on the last.

1883
02:16:27.68 --> 02:16:30.68
That's on Jockel's story as well.

1884
02:16:30.68 --> 02:16:33.68
These are, these are American made soaps too straight up.

1885
02:16:33.68 --> 02:16:34.68
Yeah.

1886
02:16:34.68 --> 02:16:36.68
No chemicals in this kind stuff by a kid, by the way.

1887
02:16:36.68 --> 02:16:38.68
That building of business.

1888
02:16:38.68 --> 02:16:39.68
A warrior kid.

1889
02:16:39.68 --> 02:16:41.68
Eight in the man providing.

1890
02:16:41.68 --> 02:16:45.68
So we have a subscription situation as well on Jockel's story.

1891
02:16:45.68 --> 02:16:47.68
It's called the shirt locker.

1892
02:16:47.68 --> 02:16:51.68
So these designs are a little bit more, I don't know how to explain them.

1893
02:16:51.68 --> 02:16:52.68
I'm going to try it.

1894
02:16:52.68 --> 02:16:53.68
They're a little bit more.

1895
02:16:53.68 --> 02:16:54.68
Maybe creative.

1896
02:16:54.68 --> 02:16:55.68
Maybe fun.

1897
02:16:55.68 --> 02:16:58.68
Maybe they might jump out at you a little bit more.

1898
02:16:58.68 --> 02:17:03.68
A lot of people have been contacting me saying that they want the shirt from like two months ago.

1899
02:17:03.68 --> 02:17:06.68
I have bad news and I have potential good news.

1900
02:17:06.68 --> 02:17:08.68
Bad news is you can't get it.

1901
02:17:08.68 --> 02:17:11.68
It's because it's a deal for that month.

1902
02:17:11.68 --> 02:17:12.68
You're a subscriber.

1903
02:17:12.68 --> 02:17:13.68
You'll get it.

1904
02:17:13.68 --> 02:17:18.68
It's hard to communicate like all these are going to be cool designs because what does that even mean?

1905
02:17:18.68 --> 02:17:19.68
No one trusts you.

1906
02:17:19.68 --> 02:17:20.68
It's hard.

1907
02:17:20.68 --> 02:17:22.68
It's hard to trust me.

1908
02:17:22.68 --> 02:17:25.68
I'm not saying you but the proverbial you.

1909
02:17:25.68 --> 02:17:26.68
The proverbial you.

1910
02:17:26.68 --> 02:17:27.68
You say something's going to be cool.

1911
02:17:27.68 --> 02:17:29.68
That's such a big opinion thing.

1912
02:17:29.68 --> 02:17:29.68
Yeah.

1913
02:17:29.68 --> 02:17:32.68
It's like you know how to kind of uncounifiable.

1914
02:17:32.68 --> 02:17:34.68
So Dean Lister, our friend.

1915
02:17:34.68 --> 02:17:35.68
Oh, Dean Lister.

1916
02:17:35.68 --> 02:17:36.68
Dean Lister.

1917
02:17:36.68 --> 02:17:39.68
He's like, hey, I have this funny video I'm going to show you.

1918
02:17:39.68 --> 02:17:41.68
And he's like, it's real funny trust me.

1919
02:17:41.68 --> 02:17:42.68
But I'm looking at him, Brad.

1920
02:17:42.68 --> 02:17:43.68
I don't trust you.

1921
02:17:43.68 --> 02:17:44.68
I trust you on a lot of stuff.

1922
02:17:44.68 --> 02:17:52.68
You know you're about to waste one minute and 38 seconds of your life watching the Dean List video of whatever.

1923
02:17:52.68 --> 02:17:55.68
Yeah, whatever some abstract thing in Russia or whatever.

1924
02:17:55.68 --> 02:17:57.68
And the video was like four and a half minutes long.

1925
02:17:57.68 --> 02:18:05.68
I'm like, so right now I either suck it up and in waste four and a half minutes or kind of a fan Dean Lister, which, you know,

1926
02:18:05.68 --> 02:18:08.68
depending on his mood, that might be a mistake in it of itself.

1927
02:18:08.68 --> 02:18:10.68
And the last you see what I'm saying.

1928
02:18:10.68 --> 02:18:10.68
Yeah.

1929
02:18:10.68 --> 02:18:13.68
Like just because Dean says this video is going to be fun doesn't mean it's going to be funny.

1930
02:18:13.68 --> 02:18:14.68
So it's hard.

1931
02:18:14.68 --> 02:18:15.68
So it's hard to trust opinions.

1932
02:18:15.68 --> 02:18:21.68
Yes, but when it goes down and you already missed it, it's like, man, you kind of should have trusted me a little bit.

1933
02:18:21.68 --> 02:18:23.68
And it seems like that's like kind of how it's working.

1934
02:18:23.68 --> 02:18:24.68
Sounds okay.

1935
02:18:24.68 --> 02:18:26.68
Use car salesmen trust me.

1936
02:18:26.68 --> 02:18:28.68
You know, how about this?

1937
02:18:28.68 --> 02:18:29.68
Do your best to trust me.

1938
02:18:29.68 --> 02:18:30.68
Okay.

1939
02:18:30.68 --> 02:18:33.68
That they're good and there is going to be glad you subscribe for this thing.

1940
02:18:33.68 --> 02:18:40.68
You could say that the evidence of past performance of what you say cool, t-shirts cool, fun,

1941
02:18:40.68 --> 02:18:48.68
desirable evidence of that is strong and predicts possibly high levels of coolness in the future.

1942
02:18:48.68 --> 02:18:54.68
There is significant amount of regularity in the satisfaction of the current and past designs. Yes.

1943
02:18:54.68 --> 02:18:55.68
Yeah.

1944
02:18:55.68 --> 02:18:56.68
Here's the good news.

1945
02:18:56.68 --> 02:19:01.68
Maybe I might bring one or two back later on an awareness on an old witch ones.

1946
02:19:01.68 --> 02:19:04.68
I don't know if it's even going to happen, but I might.

1947
02:19:04.68 --> 02:19:05.68
I don't know.

1948
02:19:05.68 --> 02:19:06.68
So anyway.

1949
02:19:06.68 --> 02:19:07.68
That's illegal.

1950
02:19:07.68 --> 02:19:13.68
It is possible, but I'm a side step, some of the red tape that I made by the way, but I'm a side step from it.

1951
02:19:13.68 --> 02:19:14.68
And all so this is what I'll do.

1952
02:19:14.68 --> 02:19:17.68
So we have an email list on the store.

1953
02:19:17.68 --> 02:19:19.68
Jocester on the bottom.

1954
02:19:19.68 --> 02:19:25.68
If you sign up for that email list, if we do bring that back past designs, all emaily.

1955
02:19:25.68 --> 02:19:27.68
Boom. Sign up for that.

1956
02:19:27.68 --> 02:19:28.68
Check.

1957
02:19:28.68 --> 02:19:31.68
Subscribe to this podcast.

1958
02:19:31.68 --> 02:19:33.68
Wherever you subscribe to podcast, we got some other podcast.

1959
02:19:33.68 --> 02:19:35.68
We got Jockel unraveling with Darryl Cooper.

1960
02:19:35.68 --> 02:19:36.68
We're going deep.

1961
02:19:36.68 --> 02:19:38.68
We're going dark too.

1962
02:19:38.68 --> 02:19:40.68
It's been getting real ugly.

1963
02:19:40.68 --> 02:19:41.68
Sorry.

1964
02:19:41.68 --> 02:19:42.68
That's the way the world is.

1965
02:19:42.68 --> 02:19:45.68
You have to learn about history so that you don't repeat it.

1966
02:19:45.68 --> 02:19:47.68
We have the grounded podcast.

1967
02:19:47.68 --> 02:19:49.68
Dean List has been around.

1968
02:19:49.68 --> 02:19:50.68
We need to get that one rolling.

1969
02:19:50.68 --> 02:19:52.68
Warrior Kid podcast as well.

1970
02:19:52.68 --> 02:19:55.68
You can also join us in the underground.

1971
02:19:55.68 --> 02:19:59.68
We have Jockel underground.com where.

1972
02:19:59.68 --> 02:20:03.68
Look, we we're doing a podcast once a week.

1973
02:20:03.68 --> 02:20:06.68
We're doing this so that we have a contingency plan.

1974
02:20:06.68 --> 02:20:10.68
We just did a podcast that when we posted on YouTube,

1975
02:20:10.68 --> 02:20:12.68
we got.

1976
02:20:12.68 --> 02:20:13.68
I won't say we won't.

1977
02:20:13.68 --> 02:20:15.68
We got the warning, right?

1978
02:20:15.68 --> 02:20:18.68
Controversial, whatever fact checking.

1979
02:20:18.68 --> 02:20:21.68
It was about the Armenian genocide and.

1980
02:20:21.68 --> 02:20:23.68
And look, it's just an indication.

1981
02:20:23.68 --> 02:20:26.68
It's an indication that we're not in control.

1982
02:20:26.68 --> 02:20:30.68
So if that was to get really bad,

1983
02:20:30.68 --> 02:20:34.68
we want to have a contingency plan ready to execute.

1984
02:20:34.68 --> 02:20:36.68
So Jockel underground.com.

1985
02:20:36.68 --> 02:20:39.68
If you want to help us be ready for that.

1986
02:20:39.68 --> 02:20:40.68
Happening.

1987
02:20:40.68 --> 02:20:41.68
We hope it doesn't happen.

1988
02:20:41.68 --> 02:20:44.68
But if we have to, you can help us out.

1989
02:20:44.68 --> 02:20:46.68
That way we don't have to have sponsors.

1990
02:20:46.68 --> 02:20:50.68
You only have to listen to Echo Talk for 98 minutes at the end of a podcast.

1991
02:20:50.68 --> 02:20:51.68
But you know you.

1992
02:20:51.68 --> 02:20:53.68
First of all, you're probably not even listening right now.

1993
02:20:53.68 --> 02:20:56.68

We just want to have a place to go.

2000
02:21:13.68 --> 02:21:16.68
Should things get crazy.

2001
02:21:16.68 --> 02:21:21.68
It's true.

2002
02:21:21.68 --> 02:21:24.68
Also YouTube channel.

2003
02:21:24.68 --> 02:21:26.68
You want to see what our guests look like.

2004
02:21:26.68 --> 02:21:29.68
Or you just prefer the video version, which is a thing.

2005
02:21:29.68 --> 02:21:30.68
Said this for a while.

2006
02:21:30.68 --> 02:21:33.68
You played on the TV in the gym, in the house.

2007
02:21:33.68 --> 02:21:35.68
Wherever you play it on a screen.

2008
02:21:35.68 --> 02:21:36.68
Boom.

2009
02:21:36.68 --> 02:21:38.68
We do have an official YouTube channel.

2010
02:21:38.68 --> 02:21:39.68
Also this excerpts on there.

2011
02:21:39.68 --> 02:21:44.68
So you don't want to listen to the whole podcast necessarily like 20 minutes before work.

2012
02:21:44.68 --> 02:21:45.68
Or whatever or meeting.

2013
02:21:45.68 --> 02:21:49.68
Or sometimes constrained event you have.

2014
02:21:49.68 --> 02:21:50.68
Just listen to some of that.

2015
02:21:50.68 --> 02:21:52.68
Or excerpts get the value.

2016
02:21:52.68 --> 02:21:54.68
What do you know about work and meetings?

2017
02:21:54.68 --> 02:21:55.68
And time constraints.

2018
02:21:55.68 --> 02:21:57.68
This is like I'm learning.

2019
02:21:57.68 --> 02:21:58.68
I've learned it fast.

2020
02:21:58.68 --> 02:21:59.68
We're good.

2021
02:21:59.68 --> 02:22:01.68

We got flip side canvas, which is Dakota Myers company where he's putting stuff for you to

2027
02:22:13.68 --> 02:22:16.68
hang on your wall.

2028
02:22:16.68 --> 02:22:18.68
Things that say discipline equals freedom.

2029
02:22:18.68 --> 02:22:20.68
Go to flip side canvas dot com if you want to get some of that.

2030
02:22:20.68 --> 02:22:21.68
Got a bunch of books.

2031
02:22:21.68 --> 02:22:23.68
I just posted a little post from final spin.

2032
02:22:23.68 --> 02:22:24.68
Which I think.

2033
02:22:24.68 --> 02:22:25.68
I like it.

2034
02:22:25.68 --> 02:22:32.68
Which I think it's funny because I've kind of I've grown to know your kind of I don't want to say signature but some things that are pretty unique to you.

2035
02:22:32.68 --> 02:22:40.68
When going to comes to writing like the how you'll start the margins like later and later for a certain like psychological psychological effect.

2036
02:22:40.68 --> 02:22:43.68
I noticed some of that.

2037
02:22:43.68 --> 02:22:50.68
But what was it wasn't necessarily surprising as it was like oh I see what you're doing there is that you'll talk and I'll talk like that and then I'll start to kind of rhyme in a way.

2038
02:22:50.68 --> 02:22:51.68
You know what I'm like.

2039
02:22:51.68 --> 02:22:52.68
Oh okay.

2040
02:22:52.68 --> 02:22:53.68
All right.

2041
02:22:53.68 --> 02:22:55.68
It's going to be very interesting.

2042
02:22:55.68 --> 02:22:56.68
Yeah.

2043
02:22:56.68 --> 02:23:00.68
The reactions to that look I posted one bit 200 pages.

2044
02:23:00.68 --> 02:23:07.68
I posted in one page and people were like what I was going to just my my original caption was meat Jessica right.

2045
02:23:07.68 --> 02:23:25.68
That was I was going to leave it that I really wanted to but but then I was like okay that's let's face it we can be too vague in life right that was a little that was a little too vague but yeah got a story novel poem.

2046
02:23:25.68 --> 02:23:34.68
Transcript that's the new thing I added to it transcript because the dialogue in it is just like a transcript this is what someone said.

2047
02:23:34.68 --> 02:23:39.68
And there's no fraykin you know playing around with it.

2048
02:23:39.68 --> 02:23:46.68

02:23:49.68 --> 02:23:50.68
Yeah.

2052
02:23:50.68 --> 02:24:00.68
It's interesting how you physically write it adds to like what he call like the experience you know where you know a normal book cool love it of course you know boom but it's pretty.

2053
02:24:00.68 --> 02:24:15.68
It's very, very very very incredibly basic it's strange because everybody that reads it gets that it's like oh I know exactly what this does yeah it reads the same in your head you like the boom boom it's.

2054
02:24:15.68 --> 02:24:16.68

is field manual.

2063
02:24:30.30 --> 02:24:31.20

Remember what my friend and my brother Steve Voitt

2145
02:28:22.20 --> 02:28:25.72
said before his last training mission.

2146
02:28:26.92 --> 02:28:31.56
Quote, there is nothing that any person cannot achieve

2147
02:28:31.56 --> 02:28:35.36
if he or she has the heart and quote.

2148
02:28:35.36 --> 02:28:38.36
So you can do it.

2149
02:28:41.36 --> 02:28:44.36
But do you have the heart and if you do well,

2150
02:28:44.36 --> 02:28:48.36
then don't let the opportunities of this life go to waste

2151
02:28:48.36 --> 02:28:53.36
instead go out there and get after it.

2152
02:28:53.36 --> 02:29:04.36
And until next time, this is echo and jacco out.
