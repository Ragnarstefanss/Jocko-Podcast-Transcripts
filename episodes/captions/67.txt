00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.56 This is Jocco podcast number 67 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.84 We are soldiers, marines, grunts, ground pounders, infantry men
00:00:20.24 --> 00:00:24.32 J'rheads, Tommy's, dough boys, GIs
00:00:24.32 --> 00:00:40.56 We march, we walk for miles, miles that don't stop, miles that don't end, miles that are filled with fear
00:00:43.68 --> 00:00:48.88 Fear of the unknown, fear of the enemy, fear of wounds, fear of death
00:00:48.88 --> 00:00:59.44 But we march on, our boots try to stop that fear into the ground
00:01:02.80 --> 00:01:09.36 People talk of glory on the battlefield, but it is only talk
00:01:11.68 --> 00:01:15.68 On the battlefield, there is only gutteral instinct
00:01:15.68 --> 00:01:18.96 To survive and protect your brother
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:27.44 Things are done not for glory, but for love
00:01:31.36 --> 00:01:39.12 We march on, we march in the heat, in the cold, and the rain, and the snow
00:01:39.12 --> 00:01:46.56 We march through deserts and streets, and in the valleys and up the hills
00:01:49.84 --> 00:01:54.08 Every step we take is a new step into the unknown
00:01:57.04 --> 00:02:03.52 But at the same time, it is a step that has been taken thousands of times before
00:02:03.52 --> 00:02:10.40 By other soldiers in other times
00:02:09.84 --> 00:02:15.36 The names change, the weapons change, the cause is different, but the faces
00:02:17.84 --> 00:02:19.28 The faces are the same
00:02:22.48 --> 00:02:29.12 The man does not change, the fear is the same as is the will
00:02:29.12 --> 00:02:36.56 The hardened will, to drive on, to move forward
00:02:39.28 --> 00:02:41.28 To march
00:02:44.16 --> 00:02:45.84 We close with the enemy
00:02:48.32 --> 00:02:56.64 Be it swords or bayonets, rifles or machine guns, spears or grenades, daggers or our bare hands
00:02:56.64 --> 00:03:02.08 We bring our weapons to bear and unleash them with fury
00:03:06.08 --> 00:03:08.08 There is no crowd watching
00:03:10.16 --> 00:03:12.16 There are no admirers
00:03:14.32 --> 00:03:15.36 It is only us
00:03:15.36 --> 00:03:24.24 And when one of our brothers is killed at Ripsa's apartment
00:03:27.68 --> 00:03:29.28 Magnificent men
00:03:29.28 --> 00:03:40.56 The best of us, beautiful human beings filled with hopes and dreams and filled with life
00:03:46.56 --> 00:03:52.64 And in death all those hopes and all those dreams and all that life
00:03:52.64 --> 00:04:01.28 is drained away, taken away, thrown away
00:04:07.84 --> 00:04:18.08 And in that moment, when a warrior falls, the whole world should come to a standstill,
00:04:18.08 --> 00:04:24.96 The whole world should stand and bow their heads and grieve the loss of that hero
00:04:28.16 --> 00:04:35.92 The whole world should stop and get on their knees and praise what that man has sacrificed
00:04:35.92 --> 00:04:42.96 And acknowledge this supreme and uncorrupted eminence of that soldier
00:04:42.96 --> 00:04:47.84 Of that warrior
00:04:55.12 --> 00:04:56.80 But the world does not stop
00:05:00.40 --> 00:05:01.76 The world carries on
00:05:05.36 --> 00:05:06.08 It is only
00:05:06.88 --> 00:05:09.04 We warriors that truly mourn
00:05:09.04 --> 00:05:15.36 It is also known that bow our heads
00:05:19.36 --> 00:05:26.32 It is also known that bow our heads and mourn the loss of that fallen saint
00:05:31.68 --> 00:05:34.40 The saint who has given everything
00:05:34.40 --> 00:05:38.08 For us
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.32 Then
00:05:47.44 --> 00:05:48.80 We warriors
00:05:50.56 --> 00:05:51.68 We raise our heads
00:05:54.80 --> 00:05:56.48 We raise our heads again
00:05:56.48 --> 00:06:06.000 And with fire in our hearts we lock and load our weapons and we march
00:06:06.24 --> 00:06:08.000 We march forward
00:06:09.52 --> 00:06:10.16 Tord fear
00:06:11.04 --> 00:06:13.68 And toward evil and toward our fate
00:06:16.48 --> 00:06:20.72 We march forward without any question of what is at stake
00:06:20.72 --> 00:06:23.36 We march forward not for reward
00:06:23.36 --> 00:06:26.72 But for duty
00:06:29.36 --> 00:06:30.40 Not for ourselves
00:06:33.12 --> 00:06:34.08 But for each other
00:06:37.28 --> 00:06:39.84 We march forward not for glory
00:06:41.04 --> 00:06:41.84 But for love
00:06:44.56 --> 00:06:47.44 Forward forever
00:06:47.44 --> 00:06:51.20 We march on
00:07:00.48 --> 00:07:01.76 Good evening echo
00:07:01.76 --> 00:07:03.76 Good evening
00:07:05.20 --> 00:07:05.84 I was
00:07:07.04 --> 00:07:10.08 Asked the other day by another veteran
00:07:10.08 --> 00:07:17.84 How to cope with losing friends and
00:07:17.84 --> 00:07:21.92 I answered that question and in that answer
00:07:24.80 --> 00:07:26.64 As I thought about it afterwards you know I
00:07:28.08 --> 00:07:31.44 I thought of this eternal warrior
00:07:33.52 --> 00:07:35.52 This warrior that's been around
00:07:36.80 --> 00:07:39.28 Since man has existed hungry
00:07:39.28 --> 00:07:41.28 tired
00:07:41.28 --> 00:07:43.28 scared
00:07:44.88 --> 00:07:46.88 But heroic
00:07:48.72 --> 00:07:53.68 heroic in his ability to put those discomforts aside and do
00:07:56.08 --> 00:07:58.08 What he must do
00:08:01.84 --> 00:08:06.08 And tonight we're gonna look at another book
00:08:06.08 --> 00:08:10.08 About another band of brothers
00:08:12.48 --> 00:08:17.28 Going back once again to World War II back on the European continent
00:08:18.64 --> 00:08:23.04 A book by a guy by the name of Charles McDonald
00:08:24.64 --> 00:08:27.60 Who served as a company commander during the war
00:08:29.04 --> 00:08:34.80 And he actually went on to become the deputy chief historian for the US Army and author
00:08:34.80 --> 00:08:40.88 A bunch of books about the war but we're gonna look at his first book today
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:44.64 Which is simply called
00:08:45.12 --> 00:08:47.12 Company commander
00:08:48.96 --> 00:08:51.92 And he wrote this book just after the war in 1947
00:08:53.28 --> 00:08:56.000 And you know I I get a bunch of books
00:08:56.96 --> 00:09:00.72 Do you and I've talked about this like somebody tells me there's a good book out there
00:09:00.72 --> 00:09:08.24 And I don't even try and read the reviews anymore. I just order it because I figure there's a chance it's good
00:09:09.52 --> 00:09:17.52 And then when I get it I kind of you know I have to crack it open and see if it's the kind of thing that I'm gonna cover or that will really suit the podcast
00:09:19.20 --> 00:09:24.000 And this book I just cracked it open right to the preface which normally I go in the middle somewhere
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000 I might take a quick look at the preface but then
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000 I you know will look it throughout the book and
00:09:30.88 --> 00:09:39.44 This preface as soon as I got I got one sentence into this this preface or I said the first paragraph from this into this preface and I was like, oh, okay
00:09:39.44 --> 00:09:41.44 We're doing this book
00:09:42.40 --> 00:09:43.92 So
00:09:43.92 --> 00:09:45.92 With that
00:09:45.92 --> 00:09:47.92 Let's go to the book and
00:09:48.48 --> 00:09:50.48 Start with the preface
00:09:50.48 --> 00:09:57.68 Once again this book is called company commander by Charles B. McDonald
00:09:59.12 --> 00:10:01.12 Written in 1947
00:10:02.24 --> 00:10:07.28 Here we go the characters in this story are not pretty characters
00:10:08.80 --> 00:10:14.24 They are not even heroic if lack of fear is a requisite for heroism
00:10:14.24 --> 00:10:20.72 They are cold dirty rough frightened miserable characters
00:10:21.60 --> 00:10:29.68 GIs Johnny do boys dog faces foot sluggers poor bloody infantry or as they like to call themselves
00:10:30.64 --> 00:10:32.64 Combat infantry men
00:10:34.08 --> 00:10:36.08 But they win wars
00:10:36.08 --> 00:10:41.52 They are men from companies i and g
00:10:42.24 --> 00:10:52.96 23rd infantry but they might as well be men from companies a and k 16th infantry or they might be men from companies c and e 2054th infantry
00:10:54.32 --> 00:10:56.80 For their stories are relatively the same
00:10:57.60 --> 00:11:01.76 Some may have fought the Germans longer than others or some may have fought the Germans less
00:11:01.76 --> 00:11:05.92 For all it was an eternity
00:11:07.84 --> 00:11:14.24 The characters in my story are not fictional and any similarity between them and persons living or dead is intentional
00:11:15.68 --> 00:11:17.68 And some of them are dead
00:11:18.88 --> 00:11:26.56 This is a personal story and authentic story and to make a story of war authentic you must see a war
00:11:26.56 --> 00:11:30.96 Not a hasty taste of war but the dread
00:11:31.44 --> 00:11:38.72 Noughtingly died of war the horrors and fears that are at first blunt testimony that you are a novice
00:11:39.92 --> 00:11:51.28 And then later becomes so much a part of you that only another veteran through some six cents may know that those same horrors and fears are yet there
00:11:51.28 --> 00:11:58.56 I was an officer in the war a captain and company commander of companies i and g
00:11:59.44 --> 00:12:05.68 And because I was a captain my lot was easier sometimes than that of joe private and joe first class and
00:12:06.40 --> 00:12:09.76 Joe sergeant and even Joe lieutenant
00:12:11.20 --> 00:12:20.64 But when my lot was easier physically it might be harder mentally because I knew joe private and joe private first class and joe sergeant and joe
00:12:20.64 --> 00:12:24.32 Lieutenant and I could not suppress my love and admiration for them
00:12:27.20 --> 00:12:32.80 But physical suffering can be worse sometimes and when the g i's a lot was harder than mine
00:12:32.80 --> 00:12:37.12 I shall try and tell you that because I am not the hero of my story
00:12:39.12 --> 00:12:48.000 The heroes are the men from companies i and g the lead scouts the riflemen the machine gunners the messengers and the morgerman
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.44 Companies i and g are called rifle companies in the army and when you call a company a rifle company
00:12:55.44 --> 00:12:58.64 You are speaking of the men who actually fight wars
00:13:01.60 --> 00:13:05.36 I did not fight the Germans as long as some of the characters in my story
00:13:06.80 --> 00:13:11.06 Some of them had been meeting the enemy since d plus one june 7th
00:13:11.06 --> 00:13:15.60 1944 when I joined them in September as a replacement company commander
00:13:15.60 --> 00:13:21.36 They had completed the capture of a stubborn enemy garrison at
00:13:22.16 --> 00:13:24.96 Breast France the day before I joined them
00:13:25.52 --> 00:13:33.40 They rested in an open field on the Brittany peninsula for five days and then they took a train ride on a French freight cars across
00:13:33.40 --> 00:13:36.40 France to meet the Germans again
00:13:40.40 --> 00:13:42.40 So there's the preface and
00:13:42.40 --> 00:13:50.40 You can see when he joins this company these guys have already been fighting for over three months close to four months when he shows up new guy
00:13:50.40 --> 00:13:57.36 No combat experience he shows up and has to jump right into the game and here's some thoughts that he has
00:13:57.76 --> 00:14:03.20 Come and fresh from the states company i 23rd infantry. I thought you fought your way ashore
00:14:03.76 --> 00:14:10.32 Normandy on d plus one you battled to the hot top of hill 192 to pave the way for the St. low breakout
00:14:10.32 --> 00:14:19.76 You storm the ring of pill boxes at Breast and had your number reduced to 50 in the explosion as the Germans blew them up in your faces
00:14:20.80 --> 00:14:24.08 And now they give you a company commander fresh from the states
00:14:25.12 --> 00:14:27.76 They ask you to put your faith in me I
00:14:29.44 --> 00:14:32.08 Felt weak and in effect sure
00:14:32.08 --> 00:14:43.12 My mind began to peruse the duties that were before me and this is when he's out on patrol is kind of honest first patrol now
00:14:44.16 --> 00:14:51.04 In one day and at the most three I would be leading these men against a team of trained killers
00:14:51.92 --> 00:14:57.60 I wondered how I would react these men deserve the best leadership could I give it to them?
00:14:57.60 --> 00:15:02.96 They could boast a glorious combat record already and I knew nothing
00:15:04.24 --> 00:15:11.04 Suddenly all my long hours of training for just such a role as this seemed pitifully inadequate
00:15:12.72 --> 00:15:16.56 If only there were some way I could know just what it was like
00:15:17.76 --> 00:15:21.52 It seemed incredible at this group of hardened combat veterans could accept me is it an
00:15:21.52 --> 00:15:29.20 In inexperienced youth of 21 to lead them into battle simply because he happened to come to them wearing a set of flashy bars on his shoulders
00:15:30.32 --> 00:15:33.20 For me I could look into their minds and see what they were thinking
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.76 So you can see this guy is definitely
00:15:38.56 --> 00:15:46.72 Feeling what just about everyone moving into a leadership position feels which is I'm not ready for this and I don't know everything and as I've said a bunch of times
00:15:46.72 --> 00:15:51.28 That's okay. Everybody knows that you don't know everything everything
00:15:51.28 --> 00:15:58.24 Everybody expects that you don't know everything what you don't want to do is go act like you know everything because they're gonna see right through it
00:16:01.28 --> 00:16:03.28 Now they're they're moving a little bit more and
00:16:06.72 --> 00:16:10.24 We're starting to get closer to combat my pulse quickened
00:16:10.24 --> 00:16:17.44 So this is it I said to myself using a phrase that every replacement uses a thousand times before he ever actually reaches combat
00:16:18.72 --> 00:16:26.000 I would soon know if I could take it I would soon know if I could justify the faith of the men of company I
00:16:27.52 --> 00:16:30.80 We dispersed to our company areas in the darkness outside the tent
00:16:30.80 --> 00:16:37.04 I noticed flashes of artillery to the east and the deep rumbling of the big guns came from the distance
00:16:37.04 --> 00:16:42.88 A voice in my brain kept repeating this is it this is it a stumble blindly
00:16:43.76 --> 00:16:46.48 Through the dark forest in the direction of the company
00:16:47.76 --> 00:16:52.32 So obviously I'm fast forwarding some stuff here and
00:16:53.68 --> 00:16:57.76 This is just him getting closer and closer to going into combat and you know
00:16:57.76 --> 00:17:06.40 Every veteran now has that feeling you know since the wars for us started for this generation start of
00:17:06.80 --> 00:17:08.08 This is it
00:17:08.08 --> 00:17:13.28 It's so true everyone's thinking that this is it this is the big one this is can I take it and
00:17:13.44 --> 00:17:17.44 So many guys will say that that's what drives them into the military for me for sure
00:17:18.16 --> 00:17:25.68 You want that test and there's no there's no bigger test than hey there's other human beings that are trying to kill me and I have to go kill them
00:17:25.68 --> 00:17:29.36 That's that's the biggest test there is and
00:17:30.72 --> 00:17:32.72 Guys want to know if they can take it
00:17:34.48 --> 00:17:36.48 Here's some of his thoughts
00:17:37.28 --> 00:17:45.20 Be calm be business like this is the same as maneuvers maneuvers just meeting training maneuvers give some orders start things moving
00:17:45.20 --> 00:17:58.16 You're going to have a look at the German army since he's going out on a little reconnaissance and
00:17:57.52 --> 00:18:00.56 Now they're they're getting in sort of a defensive position here
00:18:01.36 --> 00:18:03.92 And he says this back to the book I decided to
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.44 Dispo depot dispose my company initially as lieutenant had done we could make changes later
00:18:09.84 --> 00:18:13.04 I would have preferred holding one of my rifle platoons in support position
00:18:13.04 --> 00:18:17.20 But it seemed unwise for our company frontage was great
00:18:17.44 --> 00:18:21.76 So you can see he's already listening to like his lieutenant has his guys set up a certain way he's going with it
00:18:21.84 --> 00:18:28.32 He's not going up there and changing everything right away because he's just gonna kind of set back and see how things go
00:18:28.88 --> 00:18:33.36 Now they're expecting to get attacked and expecting to get attacked with with small arms fire
00:18:34.56 --> 00:18:39.20 But instead then's up being some order fired here. We go back to the book, but the sound of bullets did not come
00:18:39.20 --> 00:18:46.16 In it's dead came the sharp crack and heavy explosion that I knew must be mortar fire falling behind me
00:18:46.48 --> 00:18:50.40 It sounded as if the shells were falling on the crust of the ridge that we had so recently left
00:18:50.56 --> 00:18:56.000 But I took no time to look back and I increased my speed and dives behind a clump of bushes
00:18:56.72 --> 00:18:59.84 There would be no protection protection from those bushes
00:19:00.56 --> 00:19:05.92 Against the mortar shells, but I was comforted by their concealment. I lay there panting
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000 So here's these in the first contact
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.36 This is it. This is it my brain kept repeatedly kept repeating madly over and over
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.24 I must not appear afraid. I must give these men confidence in me despite the fact that I they know I'm an
00:19:20.24 --> 00:19:26.96 Experience they were playing their parts well. I've been unable to detect any attitude of distrust in their actions
00:19:27.20 --> 00:19:29.84 And I had searched their faces for long periods of time
00:19:30.48 --> 00:19:33.36 I must keep that confidence. I must I must
00:19:33.36 --> 00:19:40.96 Scared captain sergeant savaged asked sergeant savages like his senior enlisted guy and he's looking at me
00:19:40.96 --> 00:19:48.000 Go a scared captain and he says a little I admitted I took a long slow drag on my cigarette
00:19:49.20 --> 00:19:53.52 We all we all are savage said we always are
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000 Pretty good vote of confidence
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.48 And I can see the senior enlisted guy trying to make him feel comfortable with it, right?
00:20:04.48 --> 00:20:08.40 That's a good senior enlisted guy. That's not trying to make him not trying to go ego. Hey, what are you?
00:20:08.40 --> 00:20:14.24 You're problem. You look scared. You know captain. No, he said hey don't worry boss. We're all scared no big deal
00:20:14.80 --> 00:20:16.80 We just got to stay professional
00:20:16.80 --> 00:20:19.04 So these guys end up in a
00:20:20.24 --> 00:20:21.28 In a you know
00:20:21.28 --> 00:20:25.52 Hunker down defensive position that he's got a man he ends up being there for quite a few days
00:20:25.52 --> 00:20:33.04 Where it's it's a pill box you know a bunker and his main control point our command point is
00:20:33.28 --> 00:20:39.44 Inside one of these pill boxes and they end up with a bunch of guys in this pill box and then he's got little fox holes dug out
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.64 Away from the pill box where there's a little platoon guys and squads that are set up in these positions and
00:20:46.64 --> 00:20:50.40 So his his task is to maintain this security positions and that's what he does
00:20:50.72 --> 00:20:53.52 Going back to the book. I didn't plan to sleep at all the first night
00:20:53.52 --> 00:20:56.32 Now that we're in position in the difficulties of moving or
00:20:56.88 --> 00:21:02.32 Moving in no longer word me. I was filled with a growing fear that the Germans might hit us with a counter attack
00:21:02.96 --> 00:21:11.04 I decided that the enemy must surely know that the troops were moving in and would attempt to dislodge us while while we might still be disorganized
00:21:12.72 --> 00:21:14.72 11 men in a pill box
00:21:14.72 --> 00:21:22.64 11 men who must live from day to day never thinking of the immediate future but only of the in infinity
00:21:23.92 --> 00:21:26.24 When the war would someday be over
00:21:28.32 --> 00:21:33.32 There was Sparky and first Sergeant Albin Savage blackburned
00:21:33.68 --> 00:21:43.84 Crot 2 and me there was private first class Willie Haggin the tobacco chewing 39-year-old Army regular who kept us laughing with sage tactical wisdom and
00:21:43.84 --> 00:21:45.84 Served as first-platoon runner
00:21:46.40 --> 00:21:50.64 Then there was private first class Angelo Boutare of Boston
00:21:51.28 --> 00:21:55.04 Second-platoon runner who had lost two brothers in the war already
00:21:55.84 --> 00:21:57.20 Private first class
00:21:57.20 --> 00:21:58.40 Hubert
00:21:58.40 --> 00:22:04.48 Burger of Memphis Tennessee third-platoon runner who's 18 years old and red is Bible every night
00:22:04.48 --> 00:22:13.36 Private first class Kenneth Lampton of Detroit Michigan weapons platoon runner who is also 18 and corresponded with college girls from Michigan
00:22:14.24 --> 00:22:21.68 And private first class Erling G. Sauberg of Fargo North Dakota who is 19 and cleanly good looking
00:22:22.48 --> 00:22:24.48 And the headquarters bazooka man
00:22:25.28 --> 00:22:31.20 The cooks and Jeep drivers the supply sergeant in the mail orderly had been left behind with the service company to keep us supplied
00:22:31.20 --> 00:22:38.24 The changing of the guard at four o'clock revealed that it was raining outside a slow cold miserable drizzle
00:22:40.24 --> 00:22:47.52 I thought of the men in the Ford platoons in their exposed fox holes with no protection from the elements except shelter
00:22:47.52 --> 00:22:54.48 Half stretched across their holes and nothing between them and the hostile killers in front of us but the muzzles of their own rifles
00:22:54.48 --> 00:23:02.72 I had admired the unglamorous infantry soldier before but as the rain continued to fall and the night grew colder
00:23:03.04 --> 00:23:07.76 My pride at being a part of this dirty miserable infantry new no bounds
00:23:13.36 --> 00:23:14.32 Now
00:23:14.32 --> 00:23:20.24 Like I said there was he was in this main toolbox which it has protection right it's got a roof and they're a little bit relaxed in there a little bit
00:23:20.24 --> 00:23:26.96 You know, they're protected not just from the enemy, but they're protected from the elements as well somewhat so he goes out
00:23:27.28 --> 00:23:32.56 And he's going out to visit the guys that are in fox holes that are just basically sitting out there bearing the elements
00:23:32.56 --> 00:23:39.20 You know like you said nothing between them and the enemy but the the muzzles of the rifle back to the book any idea that I might have
00:23:39.44 --> 00:23:46.08 Intertain that my visit would bolster the morale of these men's was overshadowed by the effect of visit had on my own morale
00:23:46.08 --> 00:23:52.08 How could how they could smile and laugh and joke in their present condition?
00:23:52.08 --> 00:23:53.28 I could not see
00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:02.40 But each man had a cheery word for me as I approached if I had possessed any misgivings that these men would weaken under the hardships of their cramped position
00:24:02.40 --> 00:24:05.60 And the adverse weather they faded away into nothing
00:24:06.72 --> 00:24:09.84 Their courage and fortitude made me admiringly
00:24:10.32 --> 00:24:13.12 Envious and brought a lump to my throat
00:24:13.12 --> 00:24:15.12 So
00:24:14.96 --> 00:24:18.64 So he's thinking I'm gonna go out there and boost their morale the opposite happens
00:24:19.12 --> 00:24:25.84 The opposite happens he's boosted by seeing them and seeing how how intact and motivated they were out there
00:24:28.56 --> 00:24:30.88 Back to the book as we reach the right flank of the platoon
00:24:30.88 --> 00:24:35.44 I noticed a man huddled in his fox hole trembling violently beneath a blanket which covered his head
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.36 Lieutenant anti-grast him by the shoulder. I thought I told you to get digging this hole out deeper
00:24:41.36 --> 00:24:44.48 He said sternly the blanket came off the soldier's head
00:24:44.96 --> 00:24:51.44 You're putting me way off here by myself so I can be killed. He shouted half-sobbing you want me to be killed
00:24:51.44 --> 00:24:54.72 There's nobody over here, but shut up say anti-sad
00:24:55.60 --> 00:25:03.36 You want the whole goddamn German army to hear you get to digging that hole. There's two men right here with you and the next hole's 10 feet away
00:25:03.36 --> 00:25:05.36 Nobody wants to see you killed
00:25:06.16 --> 00:25:09.60 We turned away. I looked back over my shoulder at the soldier
00:25:09.60 --> 00:25:12.88 He's been like that ever since
00:25:13.84 --> 00:25:15.84 He's been with the platoon anti-sad
00:25:16.40 --> 00:25:19.20 He uses every excuse he can get to go to the rear
00:25:20.08 --> 00:25:23.20 He won't work to get himself warm like I try and get him to
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.84 If he doesn't come around tonight sending back to the CP I said we can keep him there for a night and see how he turns out
00:25:30.64 --> 00:25:33.28 So although some guys are clearly
00:25:34.96 --> 00:25:38.32 In good spirits out there you still got guys that are breaking down and
00:25:38.32 --> 00:25:40.32 And
00:25:40.72 --> 00:25:45.04 You've got to deal with them and you can see he's gonna pull him off the line get him back to CP and actually
00:25:45.04 --> 00:25:49.60 I don't go into this but he ends up getting evacuated and when they get him back
00:25:49.60 --> 00:25:52.80 They figured out that he's got a appendicitis so he's an easy rough shape
00:25:53.76 --> 00:25:55.28 But
00:25:55.28 --> 00:25:59.12 So some time passes and you know they're dealing with
00:26:00.08 --> 00:26:01.12 Sort of
00:26:01.12 --> 00:26:05.60 Clandestine attacks are coming the Germans will kind of probe them or sometimes they're well
00:26:05.60 --> 00:26:09.76 They're receiving indirect fires some orders not to alert in a fairly regular basis
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.68 Back to the book I woke at 10 for the start of the fourth day in the pill box
00:26:16.24 --> 00:26:21.76 It was a day of K-Rashins of glorious sunshine of adjusting artillery fire of testing telephone mines after enemy
00:26:21.76 --> 00:26:28.24 Shelling of signing one's names to envelopes of countless letters of requesting supplies from battalions of one and
00:26:28.72 --> 00:26:31.60 100 things that were becoming more and more routine
00:26:31.60 --> 00:26:40.48 But always there was the deep fearful dread of the enemy mortar shell that dropped unheralded from the sky
00:26:40.96 --> 00:26:47.44 Of the artillery round that screeched a fiendish warning as it approached and the deep dread to of the darkness
00:26:47.44 --> 00:26:52.80 That would come tonight just as it had come last night and just as it would come the next night and the next
00:26:54.08 --> 00:26:59.04 And any night the darkness might release a hoard of fanatical German soldiers
00:26:59.04 --> 00:27:05.04 Ego to kill and drive us from our holes in pill boxes or perhaps a flame throwing half tracks
00:27:05.20 --> 00:27:10.64 Spouting its flaming oily death into the deepest recesses of the pill boxes
00:27:12.16 --> 00:27:19.92 The nervousness was like a malignant disease that ate itself up and down the line and back again
00:27:23.60 --> 00:27:26.24 Hear about that stress you're about that constant
00:27:26.24 --> 00:27:30.32 Constant stress and you notice it's the things that you can't control
00:27:31.28 --> 00:27:36.08 It's the things that you can't control that's the horrible things about the the mortar and the artillery fire
00:27:36.08 --> 00:27:43.28 You can't control it's random and you can't control where that round hits if it hits in your foxhole your dead if it hits three feet away from your foxhole you live
00:27:45.68 --> 00:27:51.76 And I think the they had these flame throwing half tracks and I think just the
00:27:51.76 --> 00:27:59.36 The the the die by burning to death everybody knows that's a nightmare and so that's creeping in their minds as well
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:10.48 Back to book it seemed that I'd only been asleep a few minutes when I awoke the pill box was a massive moving men with apparently no pattern
00:28:10.88 --> 00:28:17.28 A deep dull throbbing filled my head accentuated by a fierce pounding that pushed relentlessly against my temples
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000 I jumped from the bunk with a start
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.76 The throbbing in my head was a big gun firing the man seated there by the table is covered with a dull brown dust
00:28:27.84 --> 00:28:33.28 Blood was streaming from a gashiness forehead a tank's firing right out of this cap and sparky set excitedly
00:28:33.28 --> 00:28:38.08 They hit the head they hit the shed with the mortar men in it sergeant Patterson got a cut in the head
00:28:38.72 --> 00:28:41.52 I tried to shake the cobwebs of sleep from my brain
00:28:42.08 --> 00:28:45.68 I had been asleep for hours. It was daylight. It was eight o'clock in the morning
00:28:45.68 --> 00:28:52.48 I moved over to the wounded man. He was sergeant Lee Patterson a North Carolina and one of the squad leaders from the mortar section
00:28:52.64 --> 00:28:59.44 The wound is bleeding profusely another man held a handkerchief immediately below it to prevent blood from running into the sergeant's eyes
00:28:59.84 --> 00:29:02.000 It's not bad the sergeant said the
00:29:02.24 --> 00:29:05.52 Disargent said just a cut from some loose brick
00:29:05.68 --> 00:29:10.56 It was flying all around the seller when the shells hit looks worse than it is I guess
00:29:10.56 --> 00:29:16.88 Some now they're under attack and I'm you're gonna notice a pattern. I don't fall covered him enough, but
00:29:17.84 --> 00:29:19.84 This poor guy this poor guy
00:29:20.56 --> 00:29:22.56 McDonald Captain McDonald
00:29:22.80 --> 00:29:25.04 It seems like every time they get a major attack
00:29:25.28 --> 00:29:30.16 He's getting a woken from being asleep because he's not sleeping very often, but every time he puts his head down
00:29:30.16 --> 00:29:33.92 You see almost every time he gets a woken or every time they receive a major attack
00:29:33.92 --> 00:29:36.56 It's because he's asleep and boom all of a sudden things start happening
00:29:36.56 --> 00:29:40.96 He must have been so paranoid to go to sleep knowing that this stuff was was hanging over his head
00:29:41.28 --> 00:29:46.88 So they're getting this pretty pretty big coordinated attack and then some aircraft show up some
00:29:47.76 --> 00:29:49.76 Some p47 shows up
00:29:49.76 --> 00:29:57.20 Like five p47 shows up and here's the description of that each plane circled high into the air and came down with a skill and grace of a
00:29:57.20 --> 00:30:04.64 Paraguading dancer upon its target the bullets from its cannon beating a staccato chant of death as it dived on the Germans below
00:30:04.64 --> 00:30:09.36 Someone behind me said oh, them goddamn beautiful birds
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.16 We watched in silent admiration as the planes climbed once again
00:30:15.28 --> 00:30:20.48 Well, their work's done for the day someone said yeah a mortar man answered reaching for a shovel
00:30:20.72 --> 00:30:26.96 They'll go home now and have a short scotch and a hot bath and shack up with some mad mousel or some limey wench
00:30:27.28 --> 00:30:29.28 What a life?
00:30:29.28 --> 00:30:32.96 Yeah and draw double salary for it a headquarters man put in
00:30:32.96 --> 00:30:34.96 That's the life for me
00:30:35.36 --> 00:30:37.76 Willy Hagen said oh dry up
00:30:38.08 --> 00:30:40.08 You never had it so good
00:30:40.24 --> 00:30:46.56 So that's a common thing you know and we're gonna get Dave Burke on here and I'm sure we'll ask them about being a pilot
00:30:46.56 --> 00:30:47.52 I mean
00:30:47.52 --> 00:30:53.36 That is you go you do your mission. I think you're flying back to base the bases are in friendly areas and they're protected
00:30:53.36 --> 00:30:56.80 So you're gonna get a short scotch and a lawn on a hot bath
00:30:56.80 --> 00:30:58.80 F
00:31:02.56 --> 00:31:04.56 And
00:31:04.56 --> 00:31:11.84 Fast forward in a little bit and also going back to him being asleep and being rudely a awake and here we go back to the book
00:31:11.84 --> 00:31:13.84 I was nodding off
00:31:13.84 --> 00:31:18.32 I was nodding off and as the hands of my watch neared three o'clock awakeening each time with a start and
00:31:18.72 --> 00:31:23.92 Shaking my head and effort to clear it clear the sleep from my brain a shot rang out
00:31:23.92 --> 00:31:29.76 It seemed to come from the very ancient to the pill box and was the cue that set off a few
00:31:29.76 --> 00:31:33.92 A lot of small arms that reverberated back and forth among the hills
00:31:34.80 --> 00:31:40.48 I could discern the slow chatter of one of our heavy machine guns then the intimidated guttural tone of a burp gun
00:31:41.28 --> 00:31:43.28 All the sounds seem to emanate
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.72 From the area around the farmhouse as if every conceivable type of small arms
00:31:48.72 --> 00:31:54.48 Vied to be heard above the company noises the explosion of a German type percussion grenade
00:31:55.04 --> 00:32:01.04 Join the uproar and American grenade exploded in its fragments wind through the air a few
00:32:01.68 --> 00:32:04.16 rounds of mortar fire exploded above the din
00:32:05.04 --> 00:32:09.12 I heard the guards scuffle and curses they tripped on the entrance to the pill box
00:32:09.76 --> 00:32:14.56 I was suddenly afraid I was suddenly more afraid than I had ever been before
00:32:14.56 --> 00:32:19.20 My body seemed weak all over and I wondered if I had the strength to stand up
00:32:19.20 --> 00:32:23.20 I opened my mouth to sound the alarm and I wondered if anything would come out
00:32:24.40 --> 00:32:26.40 Wake up everybody
00:32:26.40 --> 00:32:31.76 I shouted surprised that the words actually came forth. I don't want anybody caught sleeping in this damn pill box
00:32:32.80 --> 00:32:34.80 We had waited long enough
00:32:35.20 --> 00:32:37.20 The Germans had come
00:32:37.84 --> 00:32:42.48 The sound of small arms continued heightened by the explosions of dozens of light mortar shells
00:32:42.48 --> 00:32:49.20 Fear gripped my body and left me trembling. I was not so much afraid of what was happening as I was
00:32:49.60 --> 00:32:55.12 Of the horrible visions my mind had dreamed up of what would happen should we fail to repulse the attack
00:32:56.24 --> 00:33:00.000 I visualized the mad dach dash to reach the entrance to the pill box
00:33:00.88 --> 00:33:06.96 To escape and trap me within only to be met by a hail of enemy fire or a hellish blast of a flame floor
00:33:07.76 --> 00:33:10.40 My imagination ran a gauntlet of evil
00:33:10.40 --> 00:33:13.12 So this is a counter attack
00:33:14.08 --> 00:33:17.68 Well, this is what you've been waiting for now the company veterans will find out
00:33:18.40 --> 00:33:21.36 What it has in this youthful inexperienced CO
00:33:22.24 --> 00:33:30.72 Quick shaking god dammit stop trembling all over get control of yourself act like a soldier god dammit at least you can impersonate an officer
00:33:32.16 --> 00:33:36.24 Savaged tried the battalion phone the handle which should have produced a ring made an
00:33:36.24 --> 00:33:41.04 Unnatural grading sound the lines out he cried. I'll try the other line black burn
00:33:41.12 --> 00:33:44.40 I'll try the other line black burn get your radio set up outside
00:33:44.64 --> 00:33:49.20 So this is despite the fact that they've been mortar and they've taken some fire and they've had some little probing attack
00:33:49.20 --> 00:33:52.48 This is the big one. This is this is it the Germans had come and
00:33:53.92 --> 00:33:59.84 It's interesting to hear his thoughts as this is going on. He's turning to tell himself stop shaking calm down
00:33:59.84 --> 00:34:07.68 Act like a soldier hey if nothing else just pretend that you're a soldier right now just act like an officer should act right now
00:34:09.68 --> 00:34:11.68 Classic so
00:34:11.68 --> 00:34:16.16 They start receiving this pretty intense attack and
00:34:17.28 --> 00:34:20.16 He gets on the radio eventually get the radio set up and
00:34:20.88 --> 00:34:27.68 He says attack is hitting my left flank and right flank of love company their lines must be out to fire us concentration two to one over
00:34:27.68 --> 00:34:29.68 So
00:34:29.60 --> 00:34:36.80 What they do is and they get these these defensive positions they set up and they have pre-designated firing areas where they can have
00:34:37.12 --> 00:34:40.80 Our friendly artillery or mortgars bomb areas
00:34:40.88 --> 00:34:45.04 There he know where they are so they this one was called a concentration two to one that's whatever
00:34:45.12 --> 00:34:49.52 Wherever the enemy was attacking from they have a name for it. They say put bombs on two to one boom
00:34:49.52 --> 00:34:51.84 You can get it done really quick and this it's
00:34:51.84 --> 00:34:56.56 It pretty much almost immediately holds this attack and
00:34:58.72 --> 00:35:00.72 And
00:35:01.20 --> 00:35:03.44 Of course that attack goes away
00:35:04.32 --> 00:35:06.56 They they kind of get that one on a control and
00:35:07.36 --> 00:35:10.64 Now he's tired because he didn't get much sleep so he goes back to sleep
00:35:12.08 --> 00:35:15.20 And here we go back to the book it seemed that I had been asleep for hours when I
00:35:15.76 --> 00:35:17.76 A woke suddenly with a start
00:35:17.76 --> 00:35:20.24 Sparky's voice came to me some work from somewhere in the distance
00:35:20.24 --> 00:35:24.16 I'm trying to get the artillery. I'm trying to get the artillery blackburned voice with somewhere else
00:35:24.16 --> 00:35:27.04 Beside it get me Captain Anderson get me Captain Anderson
00:35:27.44 --> 00:35:32.72 But what was the noise in the background what was that pounding someone must be beating on the pill box with a sledge hammer
00:35:32.72 --> 00:35:37.84 What was that deafening noise? I jumped from my bunk my feet stung from the rough contact
00:35:38.56 --> 00:35:40.24 With the concrete floor
00:35:40.24 --> 00:35:44.56 That was artillery and mortars explosive exploding my head. I couldn't think I
00:35:44.56 --> 00:35:50.64 Shook my head sharply to clear the sleep from my brain the Germans had come again and what mortars and
00:35:51.28 --> 00:35:54.96 Artilities good God they must be firing every weapon around from miles
00:35:55.92 --> 00:35:57.92 There was a wild look in Sparky's eyes
00:35:58.56 --> 00:36:03.36 They've hit all three Patoons captain he cried head on they're pounding the hell out of them worse
00:36:03.36 --> 00:36:06.24 Parage I ever heard worse Parage I ever heard captain
00:36:06.24 --> 00:36:13.92 So like I said whenever whenever Captain McDonald falls asleep
00:36:15.12 --> 00:36:20.48 They're getting attacked and that's what they're receiving really heavy attack against
00:36:20.48 --> 00:36:25.28 They repulse that first attack and now they're coming back at him again in this time. It's with some serious artillery
00:36:26.24 --> 00:36:28.40 For God sake get us some artillery cap necride
00:36:29.04 --> 00:36:33.28 They're knocking the hell out of us small arms and burp guns and this goddamn mortar and artillery fire
00:36:33.28 --> 00:36:37.52 I never saw such a barrage. We got to get some help or we'll never stop them
00:36:41.44 --> 00:36:44.80 For God sake Captain hurry mill Brooks said his voice was half-franic
00:36:44.80 --> 00:36:48.40 I got two wounded men here my pillbox now god knows how many more out there
00:36:49.20 --> 00:36:52.16 I suddenly remembered the one fifty-fives
00:36:53.36 --> 00:36:58.56 That close-in concentration we had zeroed on our front so one fifty-fives are bigger artillery
00:36:59.36 --> 00:37:01.36 Shell it's a big big daddy
00:37:01.36 --> 00:37:09.12 And they had they had got a concentration of fire that's really close to them. So hey if we're getting like just about to get overrun
00:37:09.12 --> 00:37:12.40 We can call this this particular concentration of fire
00:37:13.04 --> 00:37:20.08 That close-in concentration we had zeroed on our front. What was it called? Queen 163 Queen 163. Oh god
00:37:20.32 --> 00:37:22.32 Let us get the one fifty-fives
00:37:22.32 --> 00:37:32.48 Hello, Terone to Ter three Roger tell Ter to give us the one five-fives concentration queen 163 and fast over
00:37:33.28 --> 00:37:35.28 So he calls in that concentration which is
00:37:36.88 --> 00:37:44.72 Which is really close to them. You're calling in 150 I think 155 millimeter more Shell. I want to say it has like 25 or 30 pounds of
00:37:44.72 --> 00:37:47.68 Explosive in it and they're calling it a bunch of it and
00:37:47.68 --> 00:37:49.68 And
00:37:51.04 --> 00:37:52.40 And
00:37:52.40 --> 00:38:00.72 Here we go my heart skip the beat savagery and back inside to release relay the news to platoons and the big artillery shells whispered their messages of out going death
00:38:02.48 --> 00:38:08.08 The deafening explosions to our front were followed by the noise of shrapnel spraying the trees around the farmhouse
00:38:08.40 --> 00:38:09.92 And small pieces of
00:38:09.92 --> 00:38:15.36 Spent shrapnel fell around us so they're called those bombs so close that they're getting hit with the shrapnel from the bombs
00:38:15.36 --> 00:38:20.48 That's how close the enemy was and that's how close they're calling these bombs in I called for repeat on the barrage
00:38:21.60 --> 00:38:28.16 And when the battalion said Roger we knew we had one no attacking force could withstand a barrage like that
00:38:28.16 --> 00:38:31.12 So that's a command that you use when you're calling in artillery. It's called repeat
00:38:31.52 --> 00:38:35.52 Which is actually why you never say repeat on the radio when you're seeing a movie someone says oh can you repeat that?
00:38:35.52 --> 00:38:40.40 You don't actually say that you don't say repeat unless you're specifically doing this getting them to call more bombs in
00:38:40.40 --> 00:38:47.28 What do you say then on the right say again. Oh, yeah, you say again and so they call these
00:38:48.56 --> 00:38:50.56 Big bombs come in and
00:38:51.36 --> 00:38:58.32 Another couple days go by the end up spending a total of nine days in the in the pill box and in that position and finally they get
00:38:59.20 --> 00:39:02.96 Told okay, we're gonna pull you out of the pill boxes and we're going back to the book
00:39:02.96 --> 00:39:05.44 I tried to keep my voice in a normal pitch through the conversation
00:39:05.44 --> 00:39:11.84 But I wanted to jump and kick and scream with joy tears came to my eyes and I thought I would choke with happiness
00:39:11.92 --> 00:39:16.48 It was almost too wonderful to be true my battalion runners would arrive around midnight
00:39:16.72 --> 00:39:21.40 Leading the men of company B we were getting out of the pill boxes and tonight
00:39:21.76 --> 00:39:24.000 Company I was to be relieved
00:39:25.36 --> 00:39:31.60 So there you go nine days in the pill boxes the other company company B
00:39:31.60 --> 00:39:36.88 Comes out to relieve them and they're doing a turnover with company B
00:39:36.88 --> 00:39:41.44 So he sent in like one platoon back at a time and he stayed in there with the new company commander
00:39:41.44 --> 00:39:47.24 Who's name is Captain Cowan and we're going back to the book a few minutes later call came for Captain Cowar over the platoon phone
00:39:47.80 --> 00:39:52.80 A tenseness came over his face as he answered he handed the phone back to the soldier sitting at the table
00:39:53.84 --> 00:39:59.16 They just killed one of our own men. He said to me one of my squad leaders was moving around to the front
00:39:59.16 --> 00:40:03.64 It was going back to his hole one of the bar men let him have it thought he was a German
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.76 I wondered how it would feel to have one of your own men killed by an accident
00:40:09.40 --> 00:40:15.68 Having a man killed by the enemy would be bad enough although I've been mercifully spared that thus far
00:40:15.68 --> 00:40:20.24 I shuttered my men or nerves as hell Captain Cowan said
00:40:20.48 --> 00:40:25.60 They've heard all sorts of rumors and stories about these positions makes them trigger happy
00:40:25.60 --> 00:40:33.000 So we got a blue on blue guys first night in position and they're freaked out
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.80 They've heard all these rumors. They know that these guys are getting pounded by the enemy and the Germans keep attacking and they get so paranoid that they
00:40:41.08 --> 00:40:43.08 Actually shoot one of their own guys
00:40:44.88 --> 00:40:48.72 Now these guys get moved to the rear company. I kind of get some
00:40:49.96 --> 00:40:53.24 Some they get moved back a little so not in the front line anymore
00:40:53.24 --> 00:40:59.04 And this was kind of an interesting look on that it seemed back to the book it seemed now we were in a quiet position
00:41:00.12 --> 00:41:04.84 Every officer in the division with rank of major above wanted to inspect the company area
00:41:05.64 --> 00:41:11.76 They condemn the men for not having shaved or for wearing knit wool caps without their helmets evidently
00:41:12.04 --> 00:41:13.76 An unportable
00:41:13.76 --> 00:41:17.28 Misdemeanor or for untidy areas around the dugouts
00:41:17.28 --> 00:41:24.04 These officers did not inspect my first platoon area however usually passing it over with the excuse
00:41:24.04 --> 00:41:31.60 It was a bit far to walk, but we laughed inwardly knowing that it was the threat of enemy shilling that kept most of them away
00:41:32.16 --> 00:41:34.16 So
00:41:34.16 --> 00:41:39.56 Oh, you're back in the rear now if you want to come meet you meet the boys because there's no danger there
00:41:39.56 --> 00:41:48.52 Well guess what the boys know the boys know what's up now
00:41:49.44 --> 00:41:54.36 He's about to get an order to go out on the attack so he's been in an event's position now
00:41:54.36 --> 00:41:59.24 He's moving to that get said it's coming now at the attack order at last you're going to attack
00:41:59.24 --> 00:42:03.48 There's no chance now for a reprieve the CO of of the
00:42:03.48 --> 00:42:10.20 393rd had insisted that we attack immediately to relieve the besieged unit the Colonel continued
00:42:10.20 --> 00:42:13.64 But he had succeeded in putting off the attack until morning
00:42:14.60 --> 00:42:20.20 We would jump off slightly before dawn at seven o'clock attacking a stride the east west highway
00:42:20.20 --> 00:42:25.44 Company I would attack on the left additional ammunition would be available later at battalion
00:42:26.04 --> 00:42:29.48 The platoon ladders were assembled when I returned to the company
00:42:30.60 --> 00:42:32.60 I only had one map of the area
00:42:32.60 --> 00:42:37.76 And there was no place where we could have a light to examine the map with the loutenates
00:42:38.08 --> 00:42:44.20 Sergeant Albin slit trench was deeper than the others, but that's but but at that it amounted to a little more of an
00:42:44.36 --> 00:42:50.92 Then the snow scraped from the earth and a few inches of frozen earth removed the men hastily through dead branches across
00:42:50.92 --> 00:42:55.24 But make shift hole and I wriggled underneath with my map and a book of matches
00:42:56.44 --> 00:43:01.24 One puts one of the platoon leaders one by one the platoon leaders crawled in to receive the order
00:43:01.24 --> 00:43:08.04 I would strike a match and give them a brief glance at the map now wet and sawden from the melting snow
00:43:08.76 --> 00:43:13.88 I wonder if I could have drawn any worse conditions under which to issue my first attack order
00:43:13.88 --> 00:43:20.04 So here they they moved forward, but now they're getting ready to attack and he's given his first briefing to his platoon leaders
00:43:20.04 --> 00:43:27.04 He only has one map which is completely ridiculous and I think about you like every single guy when we would go out on the battlefield
00:43:27.04 --> 00:43:30.04 Every single guy would have a battle map every single guy
00:43:30.04 --> 00:43:33.72 Yeah, if we take 30 guys they all are gonna have a battle map with him
00:43:33.72 --> 00:43:36.52 So here we are the old company of 150 guys
00:43:36.52 --> 00:43:41.64 We've only got one map and he's got it and by the way it's soaking wet and by the way for your briefing
00:43:41.64 --> 00:43:48.24 Nowadays we go into a big secure area with a power point and big projector up and we go through all these slides at a well prepared
00:43:48.24 --> 00:43:52.28 He's got a match in a hole and he's given this brief
00:43:53.56 --> 00:43:55.56 So what I'm talking about
00:43:58.28 --> 00:43:59.88 So
00:43:59.88 --> 00:44:04.60 They end up in a forward position and as this attack goes
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.84 They end up now having to switch from attacking to a defensive position and things start to get
00:44:11.24 --> 00:44:14.20 Go sideways really really quick in this ends up
00:44:15.08 --> 00:44:20.72 It is actually the beginning of the battle approach to famous obviously a famous battle and this is sort of the beginning of it
00:44:20.72 --> 00:44:22.72 Although they did not know that at this time
00:44:22.72 --> 00:44:25.80 So here we go back to the book. I took stock of our defensive situation
00:44:25.80 --> 00:44:34.80 We were one rifle battalion thrust into a densely wooded area with no terrain features that favor the defender with orders to hold at all costs
00:44:35.88 --> 00:44:37.88 We were hastily dug in along a highway
00:44:38.52 --> 00:44:42.36 Facing the direction from which we hoped the enemy would come if you had to come
00:44:43.32 --> 00:44:46.76 No company had been able to withhold a support platoon
00:44:46.76 --> 00:44:52.16 There was no support company thus the defense was a thin single line of riflemen
00:44:52.16 --> 00:44:54.16 So there's no backup. That's the situation therein
00:44:54.16 --> 00:44:56.16 a shallow draw
00:44:56.16 --> 00:45:02.32 Later the front of my rifle platoons with a higher ridge rising beyond it over which the enemy would soon be coming
00:45:02.32 --> 00:45:07.36 Another draw led up to my left flank protected by two light machine guns in a few riflemen in position
00:45:07.36 --> 00:45:14.08 Which no man in his right mind would place machine guns unless he had no other method of defending the probable enemy approach
00:45:14.08 --> 00:45:16.08 These guys are in a horrible situation
00:45:16.08 --> 00:45:18.08 our right flank lacks
00:45:18.08 --> 00:45:25.12 a right flank lack 50 yards of tying in with K company along a fire break which by sector the highway
00:45:25.52 --> 00:45:27.52 We had no anti tank defense
00:45:27.52 --> 00:45:31.04 Except two Sherman tanks and a bazooka with three rounds of ammunition
00:45:31.60 --> 00:45:38.32 We were being supported by a 99th Division artillery and outfit about which we knew nothing except this was their first action
00:45:38.32 --> 00:45:41.04 Except for holding a quiet defensive sector for a month
00:45:41.76 --> 00:45:44.24 But there was nothing that could be done now, but wait
00:45:44.24 --> 00:45:51.44 At 1030 a Jeep loaded with men clipped down the highway toward the rear at breakneck speed
00:45:52.24 --> 00:45:55.76 That would be the van guard of the retreating battalion from the 99th
00:45:56.80 --> 00:45:58.80 The Germans would be here soon
00:46:00.40 --> 00:46:02.40 Just imagine that
00:46:02.64 --> 00:46:09.28 You're there to help out and defend this position and support this battalion and the first thing you see
00:46:09.28 --> 00:46:16.88 Coming from ahead of you is a Jeep filled with rag tag soldiers going as fast as they can away from the enemy
00:46:20.16 --> 00:46:21.84 Craziness
00:46:21.84 --> 00:46:23.84 Craziness
00:46:23.84 --> 00:46:30.08 And here it continues a rag and call of troops appeared over the wooded ridge to the front of the second and third Patoons
00:46:30.40 --> 00:46:32.40 They're on out over 200 men
00:46:32.40 --> 00:46:39.12 The remnants of 900 who had fought gallantly to our front since they were hit by the German attack the preceding day
00:46:39.84 --> 00:46:46.000 Another group the size of a platoon with Drew along the highway donating a few hand grenades and clips of ammunition
00:46:46.16 --> 00:46:48.16 Which they passed to my first platoon
00:46:48.72 --> 00:46:51.84 Two men stayed to fight with my company. It's legit
00:46:52.24 --> 00:46:57.28 You just got overrun some guys are given away ammunition given grenade to away and these guys are hey
00:46:58.16 --> 00:47:00.16 Where can I help out?
00:47:00.16 --> 00:47:05.04 To enlisted men carrying a badly wounded lieutenant stopped exhausted with my third Patoon
00:47:05.20 --> 00:47:08.08 They could carry him no further. I called for a litter squad
00:47:08.48 --> 00:47:13.28 The riflemen could not be sure if the next troops that appeared over the ridge were friendly or enemy
00:47:13.60 --> 00:47:18.32 I alerted the artillerymen to call for fire in the event the approaching troops were German
00:47:18.48 --> 00:47:23.52 Lieutenant Brock's call came a few minutes later scarcely preceding a hail of small arms fire
00:47:23.60 --> 00:47:27.44 Which sounded like the crack of thousands of riot force echoing through the forest
00:47:27.44 --> 00:47:32.24 There was no doubt now my men could see the build caps of the approaching troops
00:47:32.80 --> 00:47:34.80 They were Germans
00:47:36.24 --> 00:47:38.48 And you know we're gonna get to a point
00:47:39.76 --> 00:47:44.56 As I go through these books and I highlight little sections and I read that little section
00:47:44.88 --> 00:47:46.72 I'm about to get to a point here shortly
00:47:46.96 --> 00:47:50.24 Where I'm just gonna read the whole damn section because it's it's so much
00:47:51.44 --> 00:47:54.48 It's a company that's about to get overrun right?
00:47:54.48 --> 00:48:00.88 It's a company that's about to get overrun by Germans and it's it's really interesting to hear what this looks like from the company commander
00:48:01.68 --> 00:48:03.68 Company commander's perspective
00:48:04.48 --> 00:48:09.84 But this is I mean this is it this is your losing the battle. I mean he survives but it's
00:48:10.96 --> 00:48:12.56 It's as bad as it gets
00:48:12.56 --> 00:48:14.56 This is bad as it gets
00:48:14.56 --> 00:48:20.16 Back to the book any me bullets whistle through the trees around us. I jumped into the slit trench with savage and black burn
00:48:20.16 --> 00:48:24.72 Request after request for artillery and mortar support came from the platoon leaders
00:48:24.72 --> 00:48:30.24 I called for every concentration listed on my overlay and for variations of each so that little thing
00:48:30.24 --> 00:48:34.24 I was talking about when you call in for these concentrations you got two two three and this one and that one
00:48:34.32 --> 00:48:37.92 He's just calling for all of them calling for all of them because bomb everything
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.84 The inevitable maddening three rounds belly time so they're trying to concern in the rear
00:48:43.84 --> 00:48:48.08 They're trying to conserve up conserve ammunition so they're firing three rounds at a time
00:48:48.08 --> 00:48:52.000 And he's due to get due to get due to get but the two leaders begged for an Italy for more
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000 I began on one side of the company
00:48:54.32 --> 00:48:57.68 Area and called for concentrations all across our front and back again
00:48:57.84 --> 00:49:05.68 Lieutenant Sawyer called for a barrage after barrage of 81 millimeter mortar fire the crack of small arms reached an ear splitting crescendo
00:49:06.16 --> 00:49:10.000 crescendo like static on a forgotten radio during an electric storm
00:49:10.96 --> 00:49:17.20 I lay flat on my back in the slit trench that will tune phone to one year the receiver of the battalion radio on the other
00:49:17.20 --> 00:49:20.72 The chill from the frozen earth seep through my clothes and I shivered
00:49:20.72 --> 00:49:28.24 But I was surprised at my own calmness the long nights of shaking terror and the pill boxes convinced me that I would never be calm and combat
00:49:28.24 --> 00:49:31.92 I did not know what it possessed me to keep calm
00:49:32.32 --> 00:49:35.92 Surely this is the most serious situation which I had ever found myself
00:49:36.48 --> 00:49:40.40 The smaller arms fire reached another crackling crescendo crescendo
00:49:41.60 --> 00:49:44.48 The smaller arms fire reached another crackling crescendo
00:49:45.04 --> 00:49:46.24 long
00:49:46.24 --> 00:49:50.000 Head several men wounded long as one of the other commanders
00:49:50.72 --> 00:49:55.28 He didn't know how many or how badly the enemy bullets were too thick to move around
00:49:55.76 --> 00:50:00.64 We're too thick to move around. I called again for litter squads wave after wave of
00:50:00.64 --> 00:50:06.88 Frantically screaming German infantry storm the slight tree covered rise held by three platoons a
00:50:07.20 --> 00:50:12.80 Continuous hail of fire exuded from their weapons answered by volley after volley from the defenders
00:50:13.44 --> 00:50:15.44 Germans fell left and right
00:50:15.44 --> 00:50:20.08 A few rounds of artillery the few rounds of artillery we did succeed in bringing down
00:50:20.32 --> 00:50:26.16 Caught the attackers and a draw to our front and we could hear their screams of pain when the small arms fire would slacken
00:50:26.72 --> 00:50:28.72 But still they came
00:50:29.44 --> 00:50:30.72 artillery and
00:50:31.12 --> 00:50:37.20 Nebel were first which is like another kind of cannon a German cannon with their accompanying terrifying screams played a deep a
00:50:37.36 --> 00:50:39.12 Component in the background
00:50:39.36 --> 00:50:43.52 The shells exploded to our rear and around the road junction to our right
00:50:43.52 --> 00:50:49.68 We ignored their crushing explosions thinking how thankful we were that their effects were reserved for others than ourselves
00:50:50.80 --> 00:50:58.16 The small arms fire rose and fell again and then again indicating that the attacking troops with drawn momentarily to the bottom of the draw
00:50:58.24 --> 00:51:01.28 To regroup before launching another suicide a little salt
00:51:02.48 --> 00:51:07.12 Reinforcement streamed over the ridge behind them to join the assaults the draw on the highway
00:51:07.12 --> 00:51:15.84 We're littered with their dead and wounded, but they're seem to be no end of their fanatical attacks
00:51:16.08 --> 00:51:21.28 It was the first first death in company eyes since I had taken command three months before
00:51:21.44 --> 00:51:26.96 But the news was not so staggering as I had expected it would be there was too much other excitement
00:51:27.44 --> 00:51:29.44 The dead soldier was
00:51:29.44 --> 00:51:33.28 Technician fifth grade Martin W. Carlson from Pennsylvania
00:51:33.28 --> 00:51:40.88 He was an aid man whom the rifleman idolized who had jumped from his fox hole to aid a wounded soldier nearby
00:51:41.44 --> 00:51:48.000 A bullet pierced his helmet and he fell face forward into a hole of the wounded rifleman. He had sought to aid
00:51:49.20 --> 00:51:55.60 He was a non-combatten according to the rules of warfare and was denied the privilege of wearing the combat infantryman badge
00:51:56.56 --> 00:51:58.48 And the $10 per month
00:51:58.48 --> 00:52:03.52 Pittance for dangers and hardship endured but death made no distinction
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.64 Message after message came over the platoon foam
00:52:09.20 --> 00:52:14.80 Lieutenant Wilson was badly wounded he could not walk and must have a litter ammunition was running lower and lower
00:52:14.80 --> 00:52:21.44 The M company machine gunners with the first platoon were out of ammunition except enough to keep one gun firing a few minutes longer
00:52:21.44 --> 00:52:28.40 The 60mm mortars found their ammunition supplies so low that they fired only when the enemy was actually assaulting
00:52:29.84 --> 00:52:36.16 Germans were being killed as close as 10 yards forward of the foxholes hand grenades were practically all gone
00:52:39.60 --> 00:52:42.56 Yeah, this is this is it
00:52:44.56 --> 00:52:49.12 There was no solace from the battalion each call for litter bearers or additional ammunition
00:52:49.12 --> 00:52:52.32 It was met with the maddening words we're doing all we can
00:52:53.36 --> 00:53:00.48 I told them we could not hold out much longer unless we got additional ammunition Captain Montgomery said we must hold
00:53:01.28 --> 00:53:03.84 Our orders are to hold that all costs he said
00:53:04.64 --> 00:53:08.32 I wondered if he could possibly realize the meaning of those words
00:53:09.28 --> 00:53:14.64 We must hold until every last man was killed or captured company eyes last stand
00:53:14.64 --> 00:53:17.84 And what is to be gained?
00:53:19.28 --> 00:53:22.80 Nothing but time time born of the bodies of dead men
00:53:24.24 --> 00:53:25.84 Time
00:53:26.96 --> 00:53:32.24 Seven times the enemy infantry assaulted and seven times they were greeted by a hail of small arms fired
00:53:32.24 --> 00:53:37.60 Hand grenades that sent them reeling down the hill leaving behind a glowing pile of dead and wounded
00:53:38.64 --> 00:53:42.16 But with all that's at the attacks seemed poorly organized
00:53:42.16 --> 00:53:49.04 There was no supporting artillery or mortar fire on our positions and I wondered why they had not yet found the open flank on our left
00:53:49.76 --> 00:53:56.24 There was only the suicidal wave of fanatical infantry men who being and yelling and brandishing their rifles like men possessed
00:53:57.20 --> 00:54:02.000 I looked at my watch. It was 330 in the afternoon time was passing amazingly fast
00:54:03.84 --> 00:54:08.48 Long again long was the was one of the other pertune commanders long said he saw enemy tanks
00:54:08.48 --> 00:54:16.64 There were five of them giant tigers lung-luring down the road 300 yards away surrounded by over a hundred enemy infantry men
00:54:17.44 --> 00:54:19.44 Get those Sherman into action
00:54:19.44 --> 00:54:24.56 Sherman was our US tank get those Germans into action. It's your only hope you might he's talking to himself
00:54:24.56 --> 00:54:28.08 You might hold off the infantry even with your ammunition practically exhausted
00:54:28.08 --> 00:54:30.64 But riflemen can't fight tiger tanks
00:54:30.88 --> 00:54:33.92 The first platoon has your only three rounds of bazooka ammo
00:54:33.92 --> 00:54:41.52 Unless the Sherman's can stop them three rockets are all there is between you and company I and kingdom come
00:54:43.92 --> 00:54:45.36 So
00:54:45.36 --> 00:54:51.44 Small arms obviously machine goes they don't do anything to attack and they only had and there's five enemy tanks coming and they only have three
00:54:51.84 --> 00:54:54.80 Bazooka rounds which are bazooka round can stop a tank
00:54:55.76 --> 00:55:01.20 But you know you got to hit you got to be a good hit mall that so he knows he's in big big trouble
00:55:01.20 --> 00:55:03.20 I
00:55:03.20 --> 00:55:08.56 Called Sergeant Garcia to send a man to contact the tankers and tell them to move immediately to their foreign positions on the left flank
00:55:09.76 --> 00:55:14.72 This business of improved positions was so much Bosch Garcia's answer was stunning
00:55:15.76 --> 00:55:20.24 their gone captain they pulled back to K company 15 minutes ago
00:55:23.04 --> 00:55:25.28 So he's expecting the Sherman tanks there to be help out
00:55:25.28 --> 00:55:30.96 They're gone. I did not take time for the full meaning of his words to sink in giving our
00:55:31.68 --> 00:55:35.68 Giving our call sign over the radio I asked Colonel total and told him my plate
00:55:36.08 --> 00:55:41.28 Either I get those tanks back to my left flank or I could not possibly hold the position
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.92 While waiting for the Colonel's answer I tried
00:55:44.32 --> 00:55:51.92 Brage after barrage to destroy the tigers with artillery and mortars, but we made not a single hit and the near misses only stop the infantry
00:55:51.92 --> 00:55:58.96 Temporarily not phasing the great steel monsters in the least they waddled effortlessly on toward the hapless rifleman
00:55:59.76 --> 00:56:06.88 Around of 88 millimeters snap from the top snap the top from a firtry above our heads and fragment sprayed down
00:56:06.88 --> 00:56:11.04 Naldirections there could be no doubt now the tigers had arrived
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.48 Round after round crashed into the area a momentary shrill whistle followed by a
00:56:16.48 --> 00:56:22.32 Definity explosion in a sharp thud of the round being fired the latter reaching us after we heard the shell explode
00:56:23.28 --> 00:56:28.16 For God's sake captain long screamed over the phone his half voice sobbing get those tanks down here
00:56:28.32 --> 00:56:35.76 Do something for God's sake these bastards are sitting 75 yards away and pumping 88 into our foxholes like we're sitting ducks for God's sake
00:56:35.84 --> 00:56:44.000 Captain what about your bazooka he said a bullet had gone in one and and bent the tubes so the rocket would not pass through
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.96 Colonel Tullol's on the battalion radio the tankers said it would be suicide for them to face the tiger tanks
00:56:51.84 --> 00:56:57.44 They would not move unless he gave them a direct order and then he was afraid they would disobey it
00:56:58.32 --> 00:57:04.32 And he was inclined to agree that they stood no chance against the more heavily armored tigers and the 88 so these
00:57:04.96 --> 00:57:09.84 American tanks are they can't fight against the tigers and so they're backing up so that they can survive
00:57:09.84 --> 00:57:11.84 I
00:57:11.84 --> 00:57:18.96 Burned with anger and I must have been in subordinate if my man could fight the armor-plated monsters with nothing but rifles and
00:57:19.20 --> 00:57:21.44 Die in the attempt the tankers could afford to a try
00:57:21.92 --> 00:57:27.52 It with medium tanks if we don't get the tanks we can't hold another five minutes. I said slowly and finally
00:57:28.08 --> 00:57:30.08 Thank you sir Roger out
00:57:31.20 --> 00:57:35.84 And for those of you that don't know I've explained this before out means you don't need to talk back to me
00:57:35.84 --> 00:57:41.52 You don't need to I'm not requesting a response out means I'm done. I'm hanging up the radio which is
00:57:42.32 --> 00:57:44.32 Interesting that
00:57:44.64 --> 00:57:48.000 Normally the the junior person the the
00:57:48.88 --> 00:57:53.44 Says you know over and it's the senior person that says they don't talk to me anymore, right? I'm done with you
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.56 So he's saying to the to his leader he's saying
00:57:56.56 --> 00:58:06.72 If we don't get the tanks we can't hold another five minutes. Thank you sir Roger out
00:58:05.76 --> 00:58:07.76 Shades of general custer
00:58:08.16 --> 00:58:11.84 Company eyes last stand hell what does it matter?
00:58:12.72 --> 00:58:16.40 You never expected to get out of this war alive anyway not really
00:58:17.44 --> 00:58:22.24 I gave long the news he was frantic. There was absolutely nothing he and his men could do a
00:58:22.40 --> 00:58:26.48 Directed landed on one of the heavy machine guns another had hit the technical
00:58:26.48 --> 00:58:34.88 Hit technical sergeants Smith's foxhole Smith was the platoon sergeant long didn't know if he was dead or not the other machine gun crew is out of ammunition
00:58:34.88 --> 00:58:36.16 And it was withdrawing
00:58:36.16 --> 00:58:42.000 He was powerless to stop them. He was afraid his left flank and the draw was falling back, but he couldn't see to make sure
00:58:42.80 --> 00:58:47.20 Hold long I cried for God's sake's hold. We've got to hold
00:58:48.16 --> 00:58:56.32 I wondered how I made my voice so convincing I wanted a throw away the platoon phone and the batalion radio and everything connected with the
00:58:56.32 --> 00:58:59.84 War and bury my head in my hands and cry cry cry
00:59:02.40 --> 00:59:08.72 The infantry assault upon the other platoons continued the sound of the battle reached a height which I had never thought
00:59:08.72 --> 00:59:12.40 possible before but burst of the 88 millimeter shells in the woods
00:59:12.40 --> 00:59:17.28 Vide with the sound of hundreds of lesser weapons it couldn't last forever I thought it must stop
00:59:17.28 --> 00:59:20.000 Sometimes it must stop but when and how
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:26.72 I Look toward the draw between me and the highway about 20 men were walking down the draw toward the rear
00:59:26.72 --> 00:59:33.28 I recognize several men from the light machine gun section in a machine gun crew from M company the other which were riflemen from first platoon
00:59:33.92 --> 00:59:37.84 I did not know where they were going all I knew is at somehow I must stop them
00:59:37.84 --> 00:59:44.16 I jumped from the slit trench and ran toward them ignoring the crack of bullets through the trees waving my arms and shouting for a them to stop
00:59:44.80 --> 00:59:48.000 They turned to look at me with vague blank expressions
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.24 They seemed to wonder who was this crazy man who wanted them to do this foolish thing
00:59:53.28 --> 01:00:00.72 I saw that it was the entire left flank of first platoon the thin lines of the remainder of the platoons would soon be cut off from the rear
01:00:01.44 --> 01:00:06.64 The 60 millimeter mortar men a few yards away a few yards away were dismantling their weapons
01:00:07.52 --> 01:00:11.20 I managed to get my moot to get them in to move to my CP
01:00:11.20 --> 01:00:16.88 But I could not step them that stop them there they walk slowly on towards the rear half-days
01:00:16.88 --> 01:00:19.76 Expressions on their faces so his guys are leaving
01:00:20.40 --> 01:00:24.16 Then he's doing what he can to get them to stop and fight but they're they're leaving
01:00:24.56 --> 01:00:30.32 This is it's not happening the guys know and and they're out I mean they're out of bullets right
01:00:30.32 --> 01:00:33.76 They're out of bullets. They don't have any ammunition left. There's nothing to do
01:00:34.40 --> 01:00:36.40 So they're leaving
01:00:36.40 --> 01:00:40.24 I jumped into the slit trench and grasp the radio handpiece
01:00:40.24 --> 01:00:49.28 I sat on the edge of the trench ignoring the whistle of bullets and the crash of 88 millimeter shells around us as everyone seemed to be now doing
01:00:49.76 --> 01:00:52.000 Get the platoon leaders on the phone. I call the savage
01:00:53.52 --> 01:00:58.16 Hello Roger one. I said it in the radio not waiting for my acknowledgement that they were receiving my message
01:00:58.32 --> 01:01:03.92 This is Mac my left flank has fallen back. I can't stop them the Germans are over running my left platoon
01:01:03.92 --> 01:01:09.60 I'll try to build up another line along the firebrank. We can't hold here
01:01:10.48 --> 01:01:16.72 There I had said it this was eye company turning tail and running this was eye company retreating
01:01:16.96 --> 01:01:18.96 This was eye company hauling ass
01:01:19.76 --> 01:01:22.48 This was eye company running like a son of a bitch
01:01:23.76 --> 01:01:28.32 Strangely I didn't give a damn I was utterly void of feeling
01:01:28.32 --> 01:01:33.68 Savage held a platoon thrown toward me. I can't get long he said and Scottie's here with us now
01:01:35.36 --> 01:01:38.40 Don't sound afraid you got to sound like you mean business
01:01:39.20 --> 01:01:48.000 Hello Brock I said it calmly they've over wrong long-sposition swing your platoon back to the left rear and we'll build up another long along the firebrik
01:01:48.24 --> 01:01:49.84 Did you get that Garcia?
01:01:49.84 --> 01:01:55.04 Pull back and we'll tie with K company my CP's pulling out now. We've got to hold it the firebark
01:01:55.04 --> 01:01:58.000 Do you understand that we've got to hold the firebrik?
01:01:58.64 --> 01:02:05.20 The men in my CP group were already moving towards the rear. I grabbed my must my mu set bag and my car bean
01:02:05.60 --> 01:02:11.20 Savage took the phone black burn grab the radio we ran toward the rear we reached the north-south firebrik and
01:02:11.28 --> 01:02:16.96 Crossed the fox holes which patigned an aquacopied were fought along the far-edge the clearing in a patch of
01:02:17.28 --> 01:02:22.16 Small furs whose interwoven branches formed a small dense green barrier
01:02:22.16 --> 01:02:27.44 I knew that any fight here would be at close quarters because the Germans would be able to advance to
01:02:27.60 --> 01:02:31.68 Unseen to the edge of the firebrik 15 yards from the fox holes we would occupy
01:02:32.24 --> 01:02:37.84 But it was the only spot where we had any possibility of holding I ran up and down the line shouting
01:02:37.84 --> 01:02:40.24 We've got to hold them here. We've got to hold them here
01:02:41.44 --> 01:02:47.04 The men stared back at me unbelievably I was asking headquarters men armed with
01:02:47.04 --> 01:02:53.04 Car beans and pistols to hold off hordes of attacking Germans that had already broken through all our rifle
01:02:53.04 --> 01:02:55.04 Patoons could offer
01:02:55.44 --> 01:03:03.84 There was only one machine gun a light gun manned by private first class Richard Cowan of which it took Kansas set up five feet from the fox hole
01:03:03.84 --> 01:03:09.92 Which I occupied the Germans were almost upon us before we knew what was happening
01:03:11.36 --> 01:03:15.92 We could not see them for the low hanging branches of the fur trees across the firebrik
01:03:15.92 --> 01:03:20.72 But we could hear their shouts and shrill whistle signals which evidently came from their leaders
01:03:21.44 --> 01:03:28.40 I decided they were flanking group that was on its way unseen around our left flank even as we left our former CP
01:03:29.36 --> 01:03:33.76 The attackers who had dislodged first platoon could not have reached us so quickly
01:03:35.44 --> 01:03:40.64 Cowan began to spit machine gun fire across the north narrow firebrik and I heard German
01:03:40.64 --> 01:03:46.40 heard a German scream with pain the headquarters men fired their carbines and pistols into the low hanging branches
01:03:46.40 --> 01:03:51.60 The fur trees to the right were too thick to see the area where the rifle platoons were supposed to be going into
01:03:51.84 --> 01:03:55.60 Position I wonder if they had been able to build up any semblance of a line
01:03:56.80 --> 01:03:58.80 Around came from an enemy tank
01:03:59.68 --> 01:04:01.68 broke
01:04:01.68 --> 01:04:05.68 The top of the small fur tree above Cowan's head sending him reeling from the gun
01:04:05.68 --> 01:04:07.68 But he jumped back and continued to fire
01:04:07.68 --> 01:04:12.000 I knew that the big tigers had reached the junks in the fire break in the highway
01:04:12.56 --> 01:04:18.96 Hales of enemy bullets thrashed the snow and the fur and the trees around us the fur trees around us
01:04:20.48 --> 01:04:24.88 I duck beneath the cover of my foxhole trying to get battalion on the radio but without success
01:04:24.88 --> 01:04:29.28 I stood up and looked out of the hole great god. There was no one left but Cowan
01:04:29.84 --> 01:04:31.20 The others had fallen back
01:04:32.40 --> 01:04:35.28 I jumped from the foxhole and yelled the Cowan to withdraw
01:04:35.28 --> 01:04:41.12 Savage and black burn followed me. I left my must set bag lying on the ground but my carbine was over my shoulder
01:04:41.52 --> 01:04:44.08 Absidminingly I screamed to get the radios
01:04:44.56 --> 01:04:48.80 Savage jumped back into the foxhole and black burn and I turned and plunged through
01:04:49.44 --> 01:04:52.16 The thickly interlaced branches of the little furs
01:04:52.80 --> 01:04:56.96 Bullets followed us lashing the furs on all sides and I wondered if maybe I'd been hit
01:04:57.60 --> 01:05:03.12 I felt no pain but I could not see how any human being could endure those hales of bullets and not be wounded
01:05:03.12 --> 01:05:06.08 I stumbled blindly through the brush
01:05:06.96 --> 01:05:13.52 Unheedful of the branches scratching at my face and hands my overshoes were slick and I tripped and fell
01:05:13.52 --> 01:05:17.12 Face downward in the snow. I rose again and stumbled on blindly
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.84 As we plunged through the furs I was separated from black burn in the group that had helped
01:05:22.48 --> 01:05:25.68 Broadfully at the fire break. I did not worry that savage
01:05:26.48 --> 01:05:30.56 Or the others were not with me. They were in some place else in the fur thicket
01:05:30.56 --> 01:05:36.72 I came across sergeant Albeen and sergeant Walter L. Dietrich of Cincinnati, Ohio,
01:05:36.72 --> 01:05:42.08 Machine Gun Squad Leader. We plowed through the furs together until we came unexpectedly upon
01:05:43.12 --> 01:05:45.12 K's K company CP
01:05:45.84 --> 01:05:49.44 A series of half completed foxholes dug in the frozen red earth
01:05:51.04 --> 01:05:57.36 Captain Howard C. Wilson of Houston, Texas the K company commander was talking frantically over his 300 radio
01:05:57.36 --> 01:06:03.92 He turned as I approached damn, but I'm glad to see you. He said Battalion lost contact with you
01:06:03.92 --> 01:06:06.40 And I haven't heard anything about how your company's coming
01:06:07.76 --> 01:06:11.60 He seemed more relieved than perturbed at seeing me and I wondered what he thought
01:06:12.32 --> 01:06:13.92 brought me to his CP
01:06:14.32 --> 01:06:16.72 Perhaps it was the way I stood looking at him blankly
01:06:17.20 --> 01:06:21.28 There must have been nothing in my face to tell him that my company was no more
01:06:21.28 --> 01:06:26.80 And that even now, orads of Germans were rushing toward us unchecked
01:06:28.88 --> 01:06:33.36 Through my mind raised only one thought I had failed and failed miserably
01:06:34.24 --> 01:06:39.84 My orders had been to hold that all costs and I personally had failed and because of my failure the
01:06:39.84 --> 01:06:43.36 entire the entire Battalion would be routed or annihilated
01:06:43.36 --> 01:06:50.80 And all from a local German counterattack I accompanied fallen back, but I could not blame the men
01:06:51.60 --> 01:06:55.36 They had given in because I had some way not led them correctly
01:06:56.40 --> 01:07:03.28 It was I who was responsible I would turn in my captain's bars if I ever reached the rear or perhaps they would court Marshal me
01:07:03.52 --> 01:07:05.52 I did not care
01:07:06.64 --> 01:07:12.56 There's nobody on your left flank. I told Captain Wilson in a matter of fact voice that I hardly recognized as my own
01:07:12.56 --> 01:07:18.72 They just knocked the hell out of us and the whole company's fallen back. I couldn't tell you where any of I companies right now
01:07:19.04 --> 01:07:21.04 Except these two sergeants and myself
01:07:23.04 --> 01:07:29.76 Good God. What can I do, Mac? I don't know I said you can't hold here. There's nothing on your left
01:07:34.48 --> 01:07:41.68 And then it continues my platoon has fallen back he cried. It's those goddamn tanks. Yeah, I said
01:07:41.68 --> 01:07:47.44 I had three rounds bazooka ammo and they knocked the bazooka out. I've got six rounds six rounds Captain Wilson said
01:07:47.60 --> 01:07:51.28 Two men grabbed a bazooka and disappeared into the underbrush in the direction the enemy
01:07:51.28 --> 01:07:55.68 I thought how foolish it was to think of stopping ten tiger tanks with one bazooka
01:07:56.08 --> 01:07:58.56 The two soldiers returned a moment later
01:07:58.72 --> 01:08:04.16 Panting for breath good god captain one of them said the woods just a few yards away from here
01:08:04.16 --> 01:08:10.88 A full of the bastards we better get the hell out that settles it tell your other plumes to withdraw into creek out and rock a shell
01:08:11.60 --> 01:08:14.16 Notify battalion tell them we're getting the hell out
01:08:15.68 --> 01:08:19.76 We plunged again through the thick fur trees towards the rear. I heard cap
01:08:19.76 --> 01:08:23.76 I heard battalion on Captain Wilson's radio telling L company to withdraw into
01:08:24.16 --> 01:08:28.24 Roshrath before the full force of the enemies flanking drive could hit them
01:08:28.24 --> 01:08:33.84 We reach the edge of the patch of small furs to our left
01:08:34.16 --> 01:08:39.36 May the exposed our highway leading up the hill into Roshrath to our right
01:08:40.24 --> 01:08:46.24 The corner of the fur thicket joined the corner of a patch of larger trees which extended out 200 yards up the hill
01:08:46.88 --> 01:08:52.40 We chose the louder route without hesitation we ran halfway through the patch of woods before we came
01:08:53.12 --> 01:08:57.44 Upon a group of abandoned foxholes captain Wilson yelled the group to the halt
01:08:57.44 --> 01:09:00.88 Will hold up here. He shouted we may be able to hold them up for a while
01:09:01.68 --> 01:09:03.68 While some of the others get out
01:09:04.56 --> 01:09:13.36 I could not see what good we could do from this position, but I was taking commands now and I took cover alone in a fox hole in the edge of the woods facing the highway
01:09:14.16 --> 01:09:18.72 It was good to let someone else do the thinking for a while even if I disagreed with the decision
01:09:19.28 --> 01:09:23.76 I was not afraid instead I was strangely apathetic to the whole of fair
01:09:23.76 --> 01:09:32.56 The Germans were hot on our tails so what they'd been a hot on my tail for almost as long as I could remember now and they had cut my company to ribbons
01:09:33.52 --> 01:09:35.52 They might as well get me to
01:09:37.52 --> 01:09:39.92 German infantry men emerge from the thicket
01:09:40.08 --> 01:09:47.28 We had left such a short time before and milled around to US abandoned US tanks parked in the open beside the forest
01:09:47.28 --> 01:09:54.72 A company and machine gunner private first class Jose and Lopez of Brownsville, Texas set up his gun
01:09:55.12 --> 01:09:57.52 beside a hole five feet to my rear
01:09:58.08 --> 01:10:04.56 He opened up on the German infantry with the blast of muzzle the blast of muzzle force me to sink to the bottom my hole for cover
01:10:05.28 --> 01:10:12.48 The Germans wasted no time in returning fire riddling the area around the machine gun in my fox hole with a bird gun and rifle fire
01:10:12.48 --> 01:10:22.08 A tiger tank appeared at the road junction where the where the battalion had been shelled the night before and fired point blanket Lopez's exposed position
01:10:22.56 --> 01:10:28.48 The long barrel of the 88 on the tank seemed to reach half the distance from the hole to my fox hole
01:10:29.20 --> 01:10:31.20 Lopez continued to fire
01:10:32.32 --> 01:10:40.32 An American Jeep with two eight men their red Geneva crosses painted on their helmets tore down the highway from the direction of russia
01:10:40.32 --> 01:10:46.32 Wrath toward the road junction. I held my breath the tiger tank would surely blast them from the road
01:10:46.96 --> 01:10:48.80 Couldn't they see the Germans were here now?
01:10:48.80 --> 01:10:55.20 They did with the Jeep spinning on two wheels. They turned around and tore back up the road the tank did not fire
01:10:56.72 --> 01:11:02.24 Over the noise of Lopez's machine gun. I could hear the captain Wilson shouting to withdraw into rots your
01:11:02.24 --> 01:11:11.04 path. I wanted to obey, but I was caught in the crossfire of the heavy machine gun and the attackers. I grinned my teeth and waited for a low in the firing
01:11:11.44 --> 01:11:18.08 None came. I jumped from the hole and ran blindly towards the rear bullets sniped at my heels
01:11:18.32 --> 01:11:21.28 The tanks saw that we were running again and opened with renewed vigor
01:11:21.84 --> 01:11:27.92 The big shells snapping the tops from the trees around us as if they were matchsticks, but I saw no one fall
01:11:27.92 --> 01:11:35.28 Dusque was approaching and it was difficult to see for any great distance. I could not make out the town of rots your
01:11:35.28 --> 01:11:36.48 earth
01:11:36.48 --> 01:11:42.32 That I knew was high on the hill to our left front, but we plunged blindly up the hill following a thin hedgero
01:11:42.40 --> 01:11:47.60 That would be scam protection against the Germans should the Germans elect to follow us with fire
01:11:48.32 --> 01:11:50.32 I slipped and fell down the
01:11:50.72 --> 01:11:57.04 Felt face down in the snow. I cursed my slick overshoes. I rose and fell again. I found myself not caring if the
01:11:57.04 --> 01:12:02.56 Germans did fire snow would gotten inside my shoes and my feet were soaked. My clothes were drenched.
01:12:02.56 --> 01:12:06.80 Per perspiration covered my body and my mouth was dry. I wanted a cigarette
01:12:08.56 --> 01:12:14.24 I felt like we were helpless little bugs scurrying blindly about now that some man monster
01:12:14.24 --> 01:12:16.56 had lifted the log under which we had been hiding
01:12:16.56 --> 01:12:28.08 I wondered if it would not be better to be killed and perhaps that would be an end to everything
01:12:28.64 --> 01:12:34.88 That's the section right there that like I said I mean you just can't I couldn't skip anything in there
01:12:34.88 --> 01:12:40.40 It's too much stuff going on and to hear what it's like from his perspective of being overrun
01:12:41.36 --> 01:12:43.60 and they continue to
01:12:43.60 --> 01:12:48.88 Fall back as fast as they can and then they're basically at an every man firm for yourself situation at this point
01:12:49.20 --> 01:12:55.20 They finally do get back and he ends up in sort of a compound
01:12:56.80 --> 01:13:02.64 And he tries to find his battalion commander and so he does go back the book
01:13:02.64 --> 01:13:06.48 We walked across the court yard and down the dark steps of the house into the basement
01:13:06.48 --> 01:13:13.12 A group of enlisted men were eating k-rashions Colonel total was quietly talking to a group of officers
01:13:13.84 --> 01:13:15.84 a dim candle lift the room
01:13:16.48 --> 01:13:23.52 Nice work Mac Colonel to total said I couldn't control myself. I could control myself no longer
01:13:24.32 --> 01:13:28.72 The choking sensation in my throat became racking sobs that I could not hold back
01:13:28.72 --> 01:13:34.64 The Colonel tried to comfort me and I felt foolish and childish but I could not stop someone gave me a cigarette
01:13:34.64 --> 01:13:36.64 I held it with trembling fingers
01:13:37.76 --> 01:13:43.84 I was suddenly conscious that Colonel total was saying something to me, but at first I could not make any sense of what he was saying
01:13:45.20 --> 01:13:47.20 This had been no local German attack
01:13:47.92 --> 01:13:51.36 The enemy had already broken through and taken bulletin
01:13:51.92 --> 01:13:56.96 Catching the division quartermaster and the engineering troops unaware in the undefended town
01:13:56.96 --> 01:14:03.84 The main supply route from Khrinkelt to the rear through Berligin had thus been severed
01:14:05.12 --> 01:14:10.88 The two other battalions of our regiment had been thrown into the battle and the division was abandoning all its gains
01:14:11.92 --> 01:14:18.80 In the offensive to hold this critical area our battalion had held long enough for the ninth and 38th
01:14:18.80 --> 01:14:25.60 Regiments to withdraw past the vital crossroads guarded by two stone farmhouses that I remembered from the trip forward
01:14:25.60 --> 01:14:32.40 The ninth was setting up a line along our present location and the 38th had taken over the defensive Khrinkelt
01:14:33.44 --> 01:14:38.48 There were unconfirmed rumors that this was a big German push all along the first army front
01:14:39.68 --> 01:14:49.52 The news stunned me I stammered you mean you mean I mean you did a good job Mac the Colonel said the Germans are throwing everything they've got
01:14:49.52 --> 01:14:54.48 You held out much longer than I expected after I learned the true situation
01:14:55.84 --> 01:14:59.44 So I had not failed and I company had not failed
01:14:59.52 --> 01:15:03.52 I was almost happy that the German offensive was a large scale one
01:15:04.16 --> 01:15:11.04 My men had done an excellent job against heavy odds and those who had died were not dead because of some personal failing of mine
01:15:11.84 --> 01:15:14.72 The realization made me want to cry again
01:15:14.72 --> 01:15:19.68 I still did not know what had happened to my company
01:15:21.20 --> 01:15:27.44 So like I said this was the this was the massive massive German counterattack that he happened to bear the
01:15:27.44 --> 01:15:31.44 Brunt of the beginning of the battle of bulge and
01:15:33.60 --> 01:15:36.64 You know you can hear clearly he just thought I just
01:15:36.64 --> 01:15:45.20 We just it was a local little German attack and we folded but it was a massive German attack and they put up an incredible resistance
01:15:45.28 --> 01:15:50.24 So now he starts he links up with savage sergeant savages his senior enlisted guy
01:15:50.56 --> 01:15:55.60 He sees him back to the book savage and I ran for each other like two college girls suddenly reunited
01:15:55.92 --> 01:15:57.28 smiles read their faces
01:15:57.36 --> 01:16:02.16 We both tried to talk at once he had heard that I've been killed I had not known what to become of him
01:16:02.16 --> 01:16:07.20 I jumped back to the fox hole after you said get the radio as he explained to length first thing
01:16:07.20 --> 01:16:12.96 I knew there were Germans all over the place they made me come out and took my watch and and moved me over to the highway
01:16:13.20 --> 01:16:19.04 Where they had two other GIs then one of our artillery barages started falling the crowds hit the dirt
01:16:19.04 --> 01:16:24.16 I grabbed one of their burp guns and started spraying and we ran like hell all three of us got away
01:16:25.92 --> 01:16:27.92 So that's that's how savage got out of there
01:16:27.92 --> 01:16:35.60 And a little more time passes I began to evaluate our losses in the fierce opening day fight in the
01:16:36.32 --> 01:16:38.32 Crink health revolved
01:16:38.64 --> 01:16:44.56 Initially approximately 80 men were listed as missing but each day brought a new list of names from the rear
01:16:44.56 --> 01:16:48.88 Hospitals of men who had been wounded and evacuated or were victims of trench foot
01:16:49.68 --> 01:16:54.08 The list of missing an action finally narrowed down to 24 men
01:16:54.08 --> 01:17:01.84 So even though you know they lost control and he didn't know who he knew where where from the walls
01:17:01.84 --> 01:17:05.12 I mean they were just gone he was the only guy that he was alone he came back
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.84 Or he was with one or two other guys so that's out of 150 guys so eventually they realized or he comes to
01:17:11.84 --> 01:17:16.16 There's only 24 guys that they don't know what happened to the rest of them rest of them got out of there
01:17:17.36 --> 01:17:21.92 And this is what it looked like overall back to the book our batangons awarded the distinguished unit
01:17:21.92 --> 01:17:25.36 Citation for its defense in the crink world crink health eric walled
01:17:26.64 --> 01:17:31.92 And a number of men in the company were awarded bronze and silver stars for gallantry including silver stars for
01:17:32.08 --> 01:17:34.08 Lieutenant Gophingun and me
01:17:34.64 --> 01:17:36.64 While there's were posthumous awards
01:17:36.64 --> 01:17:44.08 Private first class cow and the light machine gunner who had performed his duty so faithfully and fearlessly at the firebreak was killed in action the next day
01:17:44.40 --> 01:17:48.24 But he received the distinguished service cross that was later changed to the metal of honor
01:17:48.24 --> 01:17:54.32 And private first class Lopez the M company machine gunner attached to K company
01:17:54.88 --> 01:18:00.48 Also received the nation's highest soldier honor the metal of honor
01:18:02.56 --> 01:18:04.56 So in that one defense these guys
01:18:06.08 --> 01:18:10.08 You know two metal of honors given out unbelievably now
01:18:11.52 --> 01:18:15.20 This is also kind of crazy so you go through that right
01:18:15.20 --> 01:18:23.28 Go through that you lose a bunch of guys you barely make it out your company is overrun. Well guess what it's not over
01:18:24.08 --> 01:18:31.44 It's not over these guys are right back added again and the next thing they're at is they are they get tasked with doing another attack
01:18:31.44 --> 01:18:33.44 So they do recover a little bit
01:18:33.92 --> 01:18:39.20 But they're getting told okay you good got your got to assemble again. Okay. We got more work for you
01:18:39.20 --> 01:18:48.96 One of the men who woke me at six o'clock. I blinked my eyes several times and tried to realize where I was the realization came
01:18:49.92 --> 01:18:54.32 And with it a feeling a revoltsin that the war still went on and today we would attack
01:18:54.88 --> 01:18:58.48 I wanted to turn my face back toward the wall and sleep on
01:19:02.08 --> 01:19:07.44 And they're planning this attack. I was too busy with the various details of the movement to think much about fear
01:19:07.44 --> 01:19:11.12 I tried to recall the various phases of an attack that I had learned in training
01:19:11.12 --> 01:19:16.24 But I was fully conscious of my lack of experience so even after all this he still doesn't feel like she experienced enough
01:19:16.24 --> 01:19:21.52 I looked at my watch it was 15 minutes until four o'clock the artillery barrage would begin in five minutes
01:19:21.52 --> 01:19:26.000 L company was moving into position now the time was drawing near oh god
01:19:26.80 --> 01:19:28.80 Be with us on this attack
01:19:29.20 --> 01:19:31.20 So the nerves don't go away
01:19:31.20 --> 01:19:39.44 When we reach the railroad track the first and second platoon's jockeed into position in the open field
01:19:39.84 --> 01:19:42.48 They moved quickly into an approach march formation
01:19:42.88 --> 01:19:49.12 Small explosions that sent the snow cascading in all directions and little black puffs of powder and noise appeared
01:19:49.44 --> 01:19:51.12 Unpowdered over the field
01:19:51.52 --> 01:19:57.60 The men fell face downward into snow and rose again when the bras lifted the Germans were firing light mortars
01:19:57.60 --> 01:20:02.48 One man from the second platoon lay in a crumpled heap and did not rise
01:20:03.36 --> 01:20:07.68 His face was buried impassively in the snow. I looked at him as I passed
01:20:08.32 --> 01:20:11.36 He was a new man a replacement received the week before
01:20:12.24 --> 01:20:16.08 He was the first man from the company who might seen killed
01:20:17.52 --> 01:20:23.12 And a mixed feeling of honor and pity swept over me and a mixed feeling of horror
01:20:23.12 --> 01:20:30.48 And pity swept over me, but there was no time to stop and think I didn't even know the man's name
01:20:31.52 --> 01:20:33.20 How strange is war?
01:20:33.20 --> 01:20:38.80 Some of us can go for days and weeks and months in war and never be killed or wounded
01:20:39.04 --> 01:20:42.08 But another man has killed in his first taste of war
01:20:42.08 --> 01:20:50.08 So as they are doing this attack is a little tactical
01:20:50.72 --> 01:20:58.32 Advice here from from Sergeant Savage God damn it captain savage said you got to stay further back at least get some scouts out in front
01:20:59.36 --> 01:21:02.72 His admonition reminded me that it was foolish for me to lead the column
01:21:03.28 --> 01:21:08.24 The foolish days of leading one troops into battle were passed even though correspondence
01:21:08.24 --> 01:21:14.16 Persisted and telling of daring generals who preceded their troops firing from the hip or brandishing a bayonet
01:21:15.28 --> 01:21:19.44 I had no feeling of bervado, but it seemed obvious that the woods were undefeated
01:21:19.52 --> 01:21:22.000 I dropped back to the rear of first-potune so
01:21:22.56 --> 01:21:26.72 Leaders to position tactically if you're too far forward number one you might get killed number two
01:21:26.72 --> 01:21:30.000 You might just end up in a firefight where now you can't move and you can't make direction
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.12 You can't even talk on the radio because you're you're in the firefight
01:21:35.52 --> 01:21:37.52 Fast forward in a little bit
01:21:37.52 --> 01:21:39.52 And they're you know
01:21:40.16 --> 01:21:42.16 In a big firefight
01:21:42.16 --> 01:21:46.24 A burp gun stuttered a flood of fiery tracer bullets blazed along the trees
01:21:46.24 --> 01:21:52.24 We failed fell face-found downward into the snow the bullets traced a fiery path to feet above the ground
01:21:52.40 --> 01:21:57.36 My men did not return fire and I was glad the confusion would be terrific if they opened up
01:21:58.48 --> 01:22:03.52 The night was quiet again. I rose in motion for savage solberg and Charles to follow
01:22:03.52 --> 01:22:08.72 We had taken only a few steps when the burp gun opened up again. I'm hit captain
01:22:08.72 --> 01:22:11.92 I heard Charles scream and he dropped into the snow. I'm hit
01:22:12.80 --> 01:22:19.76 I was conscious of a sudden pain in the calf of my right leg as if someone had hit me with a giant club swung by powerful arms
01:22:20.32 --> 01:22:25.04 I realized that I too was hit and a sudden flood of fear engulfed me
01:22:25.60 --> 01:22:30.16 We were 200 yards forward of any friendly troops and 800 yards inside the woods
01:22:30.16 --> 01:22:38.32 A momentary vision of a night spent bleeding in the frozen forest swept through my mind a warm liquid flowed over my leg and into my boat
01:22:39.60 --> 01:22:43.68 That would be blood. I thought I'm hit two Charles. I said
01:22:44.80 --> 01:22:48.56 My leg felt numb and I dropped the ground the firing ceased
01:22:48.88 --> 01:22:51.44 Charles said he was hit through the right hip and could not walk
01:22:51.60 --> 01:22:55.20 Savage took the battalion radio and I designated two men to carry Charles
01:22:55.36 --> 01:22:57.36 We would have to get back to third of the two now
01:22:57.36 --> 01:23:03.84 I believe that could walk. I stood and put weight on my wounded leg a nauseating pain swept over me
01:23:03.84 --> 01:23:05.52 And I thought I was going to faint
01:23:05.92 --> 01:23:09.52 But I tried keeping the legs stiff and found that I could walk
01:23:10.88 --> 01:23:16.40 The men around us lay flat on the snow and little bunches as if gained some solace
01:23:16.96 --> 01:23:19.20 Through sharing their fears with each other
01:23:19.84 --> 01:23:24.08 My brain was whirling should we continue the attack how badly was I hurt?
01:23:24.08 --> 01:23:29.04 Had we hit a German patrol or now pushed outpost or stumbled upon a mainline defense?
01:23:29.84 --> 01:23:34.96 I hastily decided to continue the rear out of the line of fire of the wrecked attack upon the German
01:23:34.96 --> 01:23:38.08 Position from a less respected restricted spot
01:23:38.80 --> 01:23:45.28 We moved toward the rear two men supporting Charles with his arms about his with his arms about their shoulders
01:23:46.48 --> 01:23:49.28 A sudden burst of small arms fire came from our right rear
01:23:49.28 --> 01:23:56.16 And the woods echoed to the crack of machine gun rifles the fire was coming from the direction of the defensive
01:23:56.16 --> 01:24:01.52 Position at the junction of the fire breaks which we had left bullet wind low over our heads
01:24:01.52 --> 01:24:04.24 And buried themselves into the trees and snow around us
01:24:05.20 --> 01:24:11.52 My first thought that was was that K company contacted our rear elements and thinking they were Germans had open fire
01:24:12.24 --> 01:24:18.24 We heard battalion talking on the radio asking K company what they what time they wanted to pick up their bed rules for the night
01:24:18.24 --> 01:24:23.76 We've got no use for bedding rolls K company answered it was lieutenant flame. We're in a fire fight
01:24:24.96 --> 01:24:30.08 Savage turned the butterfly switch on the radio and broke the conversation with the distressed voice
01:24:30.40 --> 01:24:37.28 Lieutenant flame he cried lieutenant flame. This is eye company. You're firing at us. This is item company. This is item company
01:24:38.16 --> 01:24:41.84 God dammit. I said we're in a fire fight. We can't use any bedding rolls now
01:24:42.40 --> 01:24:46.88 Lieutenant flame savage continue. This is savage. You're firing at eye company
01:24:46.88 --> 01:24:51.52 Make your men quit firing your firing at eye company. You're shooting the hell out of item company
01:24:52.24 --> 01:24:59.52 The radio is silent for a moment the hell we are if we're firing an eye company then why in the hell don't you quit firing back?
01:25:00.64 --> 01:25:03.28 I was frightened with the realization of what he had said
01:25:03.92 --> 01:25:07.68 We were receiving fire from K company, but they were not firing at us
01:25:08.32 --> 01:25:10.32 The enemy had slipped behind us
01:25:10.32 --> 01:25:17.68 For some unexplainable reason my men had not opened fire in either directions from which the bullets came
01:25:18.24 --> 01:25:21.76 I think God that they had not started shooting the confusion would have
01:25:22.40 --> 01:25:27.44 Been tripled and I could visualize GIs firing at one another in the darkness
01:25:29.52 --> 01:25:34.64 So worst case scenario you got bad guys in between you and other good guys
01:25:34.64 --> 01:25:41.76 It's just a horrible situation and I maybe it's hard for civilians to understand this when you're a firefight
01:25:41.76 --> 01:25:44.56 You're not hitting all your targets. You're shooting
01:25:44.96 --> 01:25:49.84 Suppressive fire and so if I'm shooting in one direction the bullets are not stopping
01:25:50.16 --> 01:25:52.72 Where the enemy is they're gonna keep going indefinitely, you know
01:25:53.36 --> 01:25:59.36 So if there's a friend these behind the enemy you can't you basically can't shoot you basically can't shoot
01:25:59.36 --> 01:26:01.36 So
01:26:03.20 --> 01:26:10.40 He McDonald gets they continue on he he continues on for a while trying to get them in a secure situation
01:26:10.40 --> 01:26:16.08 But eventually he has to get extracted because of because of his wound and he gets back
01:26:17.76 --> 01:26:22.88 When he gets he's now like under warm blankets and stuff and they're these in the the aid station
01:26:22.88 --> 01:26:24.88 I shuttered at the fall of the company
01:26:24.88 --> 01:26:31.84 Where were they now did Brock's platoon get out had I done the right thing and withdrawing or should I have stayed and fought it out
01:26:33.04 --> 01:26:36.88 It seemed that I was always running perhaps it was all my fault
01:26:37.92 --> 01:26:43.84 There'd been a brief moment of exaltation in the aid station when someone had reminded me that now I could nice rest
01:26:43.92 --> 01:26:45.92 Then the hospital
01:26:45.92 --> 01:26:50.56 But now a nausea fear for the welfare of the company enveloped me
01:26:50.56 --> 01:26:55.12 I felt somehow like a nizzerger
01:26:59.28 --> 01:27:01.28 Yeah
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:12.56 Here we've heard plenty of stories about guys looking for the million dollar wound that's gonna get him back to the states and the million dollar wound's good for about three minutes and then then then McDonald says hey
01:27:14.24 --> 01:27:16.24 I feel horrible
01:27:16.24 --> 01:27:22.88 He eventually recovers from the wound. Now you think hey, you know the guys but on a bunch of fighting
01:27:22.88 --> 01:27:24.24 He recovered from his wound
01:27:24.24 --> 01:27:27.84 He got wounded but now he's in the rear and so you know he's probably gonna get
01:27:28.72 --> 01:27:31.60 Whatever extracted maybe moved the states maybe you know
01:27:32.16 --> 01:27:34.64 Give him a nice cushy job. No, not happening
01:27:35.36 --> 01:27:39.60 They don't give him eye company back because eye company now has a new company commander. They give him a company
01:27:40.40 --> 01:27:42.40 G
01:27:42.40 --> 01:27:43.76 So
01:27:43.76 --> 01:27:47.20 Now he's in company G and what are they doing? Are they in the rear somewhere?
01:27:47.36 --> 01:27:50.32 Relaxing? No, it's a tack time. They're going forward
01:27:52.88 --> 01:27:56.88 So here we go. We would back to the book. We would attack the next morning at 445
01:27:57.20 --> 01:28:03.52 Someone awakened me at 330 the next morning. It was cold in the room and I shivered as I climbed from my sleeping bag my mind was
01:28:03.52 --> 01:28:07.52 Dulled with sleep and I wanted to climb back into the warm sleeping bag and sleep on and on
01:28:08.08 --> 01:28:11.36 I wanted to scream to hell with the war and go back to sleep
01:28:11.36 --> 01:28:18.40 The sun jolt of awakening was like a emerging emerging from a wonderful peaceful world
01:28:18.80 --> 01:28:20.80 Into a world of forbidding reality
01:28:22.24 --> 01:28:26.80 There would be men hurt today, perhaps killed men from my own company
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000 It could be me
01:28:30.40 --> 01:28:35.44 That seemed remote and impossible but it did not remove by fear for the others
01:28:35.92 --> 01:28:40.88 There were many responsibilities had I given the platoon leaders all the information they would need
01:28:40.88 --> 01:28:46.72 How was my attack plan was there some important detail I had forgotten would I back be defended?
01:28:46.88 --> 01:28:56.48 Would our attack be discovered as we cross the flat open field towards the town? Oh God if we could but rush from the house into the attack without thinking again
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.04 It was the waiting and the thinking and the wondering that got you
01:29:04.64 --> 01:29:06.64 Talked about that before
01:29:06.96 --> 01:29:08.96 That fear that you're feeling
01:29:08.96 --> 01:29:15.68 It's the waiting it's the hesitation and he's saying hey if we could just go from this house that I'm sitting right now right into the attack
01:29:16.32 --> 01:29:18.32 That's what he'd prefer to do
01:29:20.64 --> 01:29:22.64 But he can
01:29:24.56 --> 01:29:26.56 And now they're moving to the attack is
01:29:28.16 --> 01:29:32.80 Is full on now the last man in the forward positions crossed the crest of the small hill
01:29:33.04 --> 01:29:36.88 They should be almost inside the first house is a bend or from now I thought I
01:29:36.88 --> 01:29:43.60 Holded the CP grouping the sun can trail running across the crest of the hill until junior to ask a report from the assault platoon
01:29:44.32 --> 01:29:51.68 Suddenly a tank fired from somewhere to a front a big show a show word over or low over our heads a machine gun chattered
01:29:52.40 --> 01:29:57.28 Around of tank fire rip from the limb from the tree above our head a burp gun
01:29:58.08 --> 01:30:04.24 Said burp burp there was no question now we had hit their defenses the Germans to head tanks
01:30:04.24 --> 01:30:06.24 I
01:30:06.48 --> 01:30:12.80 Was trembling slightly from the excitement, but I was not as definitely afraid as I had once been in the pillbox positions
01:30:13.20 --> 01:30:19.36 The opinion often expressed amongst some GIs that ever after any man was wounded once
01:30:19.52 --> 01:30:24.40 He was never any good in combat again did not hold true in my case
01:30:24.40 --> 01:30:34.40 I was more calm than ever before but I was also more cautious now
01:30:35.60 --> 01:30:38.80 They proceed with that attack and again, obviously
01:30:40.80 --> 01:30:51.12 There's this book is just filled with tactical situation after tactical situation after lesson learn after lesson learn after tactical situation and and I'm not reading the entire book right now
01:30:51.12 --> 01:30:57.44 But that is why you get the book so that you can get all this information from it
01:30:57.44 --> 01:31:00.88 I can't give it all to you on a podcast. You have to read it
01:31:01.92 --> 01:31:04.96 But fast forwarding through that assault
01:31:06.64 --> 01:31:13.68 Back to the book I stopped longer at the house where the men from the squad of the sergeant who had been killed were preparing for the night
01:31:14.32 --> 01:31:19.68 I not known the sergeant personally, but to these men he was an important character in the little war that
01:31:19.68 --> 01:31:21.68 Revolved around themselves
01:31:22.72 --> 01:31:26.48 There was an undertone of sadness as they talked, but there was no bitterness
01:31:27.44 --> 01:31:30.96 The sergeant had died like any one of them might die at any time
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000 There was a war on you know
01:31:34.40 --> 01:31:36.72 And what I like about that is he points out that
01:31:38.48 --> 01:31:43.76 You know from his perspective all this stuff is going on he realizes that these guys
01:31:43.76 --> 01:31:51.04 That's the whole world to them right that sergeant that was killed that's their guy and their war is
01:31:52.08 --> 01:31:57.92 Everything to them and it's just like when you meet people you know if you're to business and you go and meet someone on the front lines like they don't care
01:31:58.16 --> 01:32:01.36 I'm not saying they don't care, but they've got their whole world in
01:32:02.64 --> 01:32:04.64 What they're doing
01:32:04.64 --> 01:32:08.32 So you got to be cognizant of that you got to understand that and
01:32:08.32 --> 01:32:15.04 And you got to keep that perspective when you go out and talk to people can't be like, oh, you know
01:32:15.04 --> 01:32:20.08 Hey, there's a lot of people that I killed today. No, it doesn't matter to these guys. Not only one guy that matters to these guys
01:32:23.20 --> 01:32:24.56 Now
01:32:24.56 --> 01:32:26.56 Like I said this book is
01:32:26.56 --> 01:32:30.32 covers a ton of different combat and they go
01:32:31.20 --> 01:32:36.64 While he's in charge of G company they go through all these different towns and they go through the town of
01:32:36.64 --> 01:32:41.92 Humbresson across the Vester River and they go through elder house and they go through varloss
01:32:41.92 --> 01:32:46.80 And they go through varminson and they go through menger housing and G's Mar
01:32:47.44 --> 01:32:52.24 And they're going just from from city to city they're going very quickly and the fighting
01:32:53.92 --> 01:33:01.44 It's becoming a little easier as they're going the defenses, you know the Germans are running out of out of people they're running out of
01:33:01.44 --> 01:33:08.000 You know supplies as well so the fighting's getting easier but they're still meeting some hardcore
01:33:09.12 --> 01:33:13.60 Some hardcore defenders and one of the things that's happened that's really horrible is
01:33:15.04 --> 01:33:20.32 They the the Germans now are using anti aircraft weapons against the ground troops
01:33:20.48 --> 01:33:27.76 So anti aircraft weapons make flock they go up in the air and they explode and they're now using those against the ground troops and
01:33:27.76 --> 01:33:34.24 There's a it just the way that these browns are coming in exploding above them
01:33:34.56 --> 01:33:40.32 It's it's a nightmare and it's really hard for them to fight so they've got some good efforts going on to go and take out these
01:33:41.36 --> 01:33:42.56 These
01:33:42.56 --> 01:33:48.40 Anti aircraft weapons and one of the one of the anti or one of the groups of anti aircraft weapons that they take out
01:33:49.44 --> 01:33:54.56 They finally get they finally take out these anti aircraft weapons through an assault and when they get down with the assault
01:33:54.56 --> 01:33:59.76 McDonald comes up on the position and here we go back to the book sergeant Paton said the Germans
01:33:59.76 --> 01:34:03.28 Manning the position in the field which held them up were bastards
01:34:04.56 --> 01:34:11.04 They had two AA guns he said some of them wanted a surrender, but every time a crowd would jump out of his hole to surrender
01:34:11.36 --> 01:34:14.16 Some other crowd SOB would shoot him right in the back
01:34:15.20 --> 01:34:19.28 Counting a ones they killed and the ones we got to there's 19 dead
01:34:19.28 --> 01:34:25.12 Paton had one man slightly wounded in the arm, but he'd already walked back to guys more
01:34:26.24 --> 01:34:28.24 to the aid station
01:34:28.88 --> 01:34:35.84 My weapons platoon and platoon of heavy machine guns from each company arrived from their supporting position outside guys
01:34:35.84 --> 01:34:41.36 Mark sergeant Mark Mitchell was killed one of the sergeant from the heavy machine gun told me
01:34:43.12 --> 01:34:46.08 I could not think of for a moment who sergeant Mitchell was
01:34:46.08 --> 01:34:51.76 Then I remembered he was the pleasant perennial cheerful tech sergeant command of the platoon
01:34:51.76 --> 01:34:55.44 Who was received his commission as a second lieutenant in a few days
01:34:57.36 --> 01:35:00.56 An anti aircraft gun fired from the woods to the south
01:35:01.12 --> 01:35:03.76 The sergeant continued and sergeant Mitchell got hit
01:35:04.56 --> 01:35:09.12 He was unconscious and the aid man took him back to one of the T.Ds to give him first aid
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.24 T.D is a tank destroyer. It's like another tank
01:35:12.24 --> 01:35:15.76 But they're specifically meant to fight other tanks
01:35:16.64 --> 01:35:22.40 The aircraft gun fired again in the goddamn T.D backed up ran right over sergeant Mitchell
01:35:25.36 --> 01:35:28.96 So that's another thing that
01:35:30.56 --> 01:35:33.04 You have to train for is when you're working with armor
01:35:33.04 --> 01:35:35.68 When you're working the tanks they don't know what's going on around them
01:35:35.68 --> 01:35:39.44 They don't have like rear view backup cameras and so if you get in a way of a tank
01:35:39.44 --> 01:35:45.52 It's gonna run you over and so that's something that we we we were lucky when we before we went on the planet
01:35:45.52 --> 01:35:51.44 We'd go work with tanks a little bit and that's where we'd learn that lesson because you might think all take cover behind this tank that tank could move at any moment
01:35:52.40 --> 01:35:58.32 So you got to be very careful that young troopers out there if you don't work with tanks often stay out of their way
01:36:02.24 --> 01:36:08.96 Here's as they're continuing to press through and press through and press through from village to village from town to town
01:36:08.96 --> 01:36:10.64 Again, they're moving pretty rapidly now
01:36:12.48 --> 01:36:14.96 Back to the book Colonel Smith rolled up beside me
01:36:15.92 --> 01:36:17.92 beside my tank and his Jeep
01:36:18.24 --> 01:36:23.04 Nice going Macky said you're doing a really swell job just keep the moving the faster the better
01:36:23.92 --> 01:36:27.04 Don't thank me Colonel. I said meaning it and
01:36:27.68 --> 01:36:29.92 Disgusted that it sounded melodramatic
01:36:31.28 --> 01:36:35.68 Think boutinne bagbie and the first platoon. I'm just tagging along
01:36:35.68 --> 01:36:41.36 So you got a leader there that's not looking to grab all the credit himself
01:36:42.40 --> 01:36:44.40 But give it to his troops
01:36:44.96 --> 01:36:46.96 Now like I said the fighting
01:36:48.80 --> 01:36:50.80 Continues to get
01:36:50.80 --> 01:36:52.80 Easier and easier and they're starting to see
01:36:53.36 --> 01:36:55.20 You know people
01:36:55.20 --> 01:37:03.36 Surrender they're also starting to see like young kids because you start to see the hate their youth that are being recruited there 13 years old 14 years old kids that are surrendering
01:37:03.36 --> 01:37:05.36 They fight through
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.92 Corbetha and low pits and strikes dwarf and I apologize for my lack of German
01:37:13.60 --> 01:37:15.60 Speaking capability
01:37:16.80 --> 01:37:18.80 But they get
01:37:20.56 --> 01:37:22.56 They get into one town and
01:37:23.68 --> 01:37:28.000 One of the latinets lieutenant Whitman kind of pushes into the town with a small team and
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000 And
01:37:30.40 --> 01:37:37.68 He's in there he's in one of the buildings and all of a sudden like a massive group of of German soldiers comes in and they're kind of stuck there
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:44.32 So here we go back to the book the Lieutenant Whitman called suddenly over the radio and I knew by the excitement and his voice
01:37:44.32 --> 01:37:46.56 That something had either happened or was about to happen
01:37:46.56 --> 01:37:52.32 You better get somebody else up here to help us out sounds like a whole regiment of crowds coming on coming this way up the highway
01:37:53.68 --> 01:37:57.20 So this he's trying to figure out what's happening
01:37:57.20 --> 01:38:00.000 And then the radio is buttered hello G
01:38:00.56 --> 01:38:01.60 G6
01:38:01.60 --> 01:38:08.88 This is Whit so G6 is the call sign for for McDonald's hello G6. This is Whit for God sake get someone up here to help
01:38:08.88 --> 01:38:10.88 There's Germans all over the goddamn place
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.24 I grass the speaker from West Miller's outstretched hand. Whit. This is Mack I said they call us halfway across them open field
01:38:18.24 --> 01:38:19.76 The men have taken off
01:38:19.76 --> 01:38:24.72 I'll have to go back and get them to come up over for God sake get us up some help quick
01:38:24.72 --> 01:38:27.76 We're completely surrounded Roger out
01:38:28.96 --> 01:38:31.92 So now Whitman's in one of these buildings completely surrounded
01:38:34.16 --> 01:38:41.28 This continues on the the battalion radio a silent I called for Lieutenant Whitman and his voice came through weekly as though he were speaking
01:38:41.84 --> 01:38:43.84 In a stage whisper
01:38:43.84 --> 01:38:47.92 I'm back on the left side of the highway. He said in a house. I've got nine men with me
01:38:47.92 --> 01:38:54.56 Germans are running all around all over the place. I lost track of all the other men heard some of them surrendering
01:38:54.96 --> 01:38:59.52 Get us some help quick or they'll find out where we are when they start searching the houses
01:39:00.72 --> 01:39:02.32 So
01:39:02.32 --> 01:39:05.68 McDonald tries to okay calls battalion hey we need some help when he's in help here
01:39:06.08 --> 01:39:06.88 No
01:39:06.88 --> 01:39:12.08 You don't get any help and so he tells Whitman or Whitman here's in on the radio that he's not gonna get any help
01:39:12.08 --> 01:39:14.96 He's not gonna get any support and this is what Whitman says
01:39:14.96 --> 01:39:19.20 There's only one thing to do then he continued if we have to wait that long
01:39:19.20 --> 01:39:24.48 They're sure to find us will go down to the seller and you start plastering us with artillery fire
01:39:24.72 --> 01:39:27.20 We're inside and the crowds are out in the open
01:39:27.68 --> 01:39:29.68 We'll help you direct fire from here
01:39:30.32 --> 01:39:35.68 I knew his decision called for a generous amount of fortitude even though he would be partially protected in the seller
01:39:35.84 --> 01:39:40.08 Lieutenant Reed set up his artillery radio and artillery gave us a priority mission
01:39:40.08 --> 01:39:46.40 Sergeant Barnes arrived with his platoon and the machine gun section. I sent them into position along with the heavy
01:39:46.64 --> 01:39:48.64 Uplatoon of heavy machine guns from age company
01:39:49.28 --> 01:39:54.48 To hell with the ammunition I said we'll get more from somewhere spray the hell out of the whole area
01:39:55.28 --> 01:40:00.96 The machine guns opened up and artillery whistleed overhead thundering into the open field dangerously close to the pailing fence
01:40:01.36 --> 01:40:06.000 At the end of the garden 300 short lieutenant Reed yelled into his radio 300 short
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:12.48 The artillery whistleed overhead to get implemented into the houses beyond us with a terrific roar orange flames
01:40:12.48 --> 01:40:17.44 Let the darkness like flashes of lightning that's right on top of us call Whitman cried delighted
01:40:17.76 --> 01:40:21.44 Let her go again. We can hear Germans running all over the place outside
01:40:22.08 --> 01:40:26.56 Lieutenant Reed called for barrage after barrage and the big shells roared into the objective
01:40:27.04 --> 01:40:30.64 The Germans made feeble efforts at retaliation with their machine guns
01:40:30.72 --> 01:40:34.16 But the shots died away in the explosion of the big artillery shells
01:40:34.16 --> 01:40:39.68 A direct hit transformed a house into a massive roaring flames is that your house I asked Whitman
01:40:40.16 --> 01:40:45.20 Half-fierfully no seems to be on our left answered give us another volley in the same place
01:40:45.60 --> 01:40:48.08 Sounds like a tank or some kind of armored car pulled up
01:40:48.48 --> 01:40:50.80 Lieutenant Reed called for a repeat volley
01:40:51.36 --> 01:40:55.44 That hit just right Whitman said his voice scarcely audible over the radio
01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.32 I wondered what had happened to his radio and was afraid that perhaps the batteries were going dead
01:41:00.32 --> 01:41:06.40 And we would lose our only means of communication. I can't talk loud. He said I've got 15 crowd prisoners down here in the
01:41:06.40 --> 01:41:09.20 Seller with me and some Germans have come in upstairs
01:41:09.36 --> 01:41:14.48 We can hear them walking around if one of these prisoners so much as opens his mouth. I'll plug him
01:41:17.60 --> 01:41:22.40 So there's another situation where you're calling in artillery to your position
01:41:22.72 --> 01:41:24.72 Use happen to be in the seller of a house
01:41:24.72 --> 01:41:26.72 Hmm
01:41:28.40 --> 01:41:30.40 Crazy
01:41:31.92 --> 01:41:35.28 Here they're they're doing a little salt and
01:41:37.92 --> 01:41:43.28 It's set up like a frontal assault, but he wants to make a little adjustment here the obvious solution
01:41:44.08 --> 01:41:48.72 To being unable to advance frontally against the unseen enemy was to send a flanking
01:41:48.72 --> 01:41:54.48 Platoon around to the right having them enter the woods and come out on coming in on the defenders from the flank and
01:41:54.88 --> 01:42:02.64 Rear but I balked at the thought of sending one platoon such a great distance when for all I knew the woods beyond the canals might be thick with enemy
01:42:03.44 --> 01:42:08.88 I decided to cover our front with artillery and after two platoons try to advance frontally and
01:42:09.12 --> 01:42:13.44 Notified second and third platoon to be ready to move forward under cover of artillery barrage
01:42:13.44 --> 01:42:21.60 But the enemy came suddenly to life when the rifleman rose to go forward and repulsed three efforts to advance so he wants to flank
01:42:22.40 --> 01:42:24.40 But he's weighing it in his head
01:42:24.64 --> 01:42:30.24 The the flanking position through the woods in order to flank he needs to put his guys through the woods through an area
01:42:30.24 --> 01:42:34.88 He doesn't know doesn't know how well it's defended so he says you know what instead of doing a flank which is what I want to do
01:42:35.84 --> 01:42:37.52 I'm just gonna put down some artillery fire
01:42:37.52 --> 01:42:42.32 We're gonna do a frontal assault they get shut down and eventually he does make the decision
01:42:42.32 --> 01:42:47.84 You know what the bet the decision now becomes okay front all salt is not gonna work now. I'm gonna have to flank
01:42:47.84 --> 01:42:50.88 He goes back to that flank. I sent Whitman with a spare
01:42:51.44 --> 01:42:55.20 300 radio in order to McCross the canal he moved out quickly and far to the right
01:42:55.36 --> 01:43:00.72 I could see his men emerge from the woods and way to cross the first canal the water coming to the necks of this shorter men
01:43:01.36 --> 01:43:06.72 My fear of a larger enemy force in the woods overcame my fear for safety of our left flank
01:43:06.72 --> 01:43:10.24 And I ordered Lieutenant Bagbees platoon to follow the flanking force
01:43:10.24 --> 01:43:16.40 We could see the little dots that were Whitman's men emerge from the woodline and double time towards the garden
01:43:16.40 --> 01:43:19.68 Lieutenant Reed stopped the artillery fire the third platoon
01:43:20.48 --> 01:43:25.20 To my front began to advance and a new is only a matter of minutes until the objective would be ours
01:43:26.08 --> 01:43:30.08 I singled the CP group and we moved to the railroad tracks on the
01:43:31.28 --> 01:43:37.04 And on toward the bridge past three wounded Germans lined helplessly in the gully beside the tracks were bonds men
01:43:37.04 --> 01:43:44.000 And it evidently shot them earlier in the day the automatic the enemy automatic weapon suddenly opened up again at the third platoon
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.16 But the men were close enough now to pick up
01:43:46.80 --> 01:43:52.96 the bush from which it was firing they fired round after routing the clump of bushes and the weapon was silent
01:43:52.96 --> 01:43:58.24 So eventually he gets his flank on and that's what that's what wins the day
01:43:59.44 --> 01:44:00.80 now
01:44:00.80 --> 01:44:02.000 again
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.40 a lot is covered as they do this
01:44:04.40 --> 01:44:09.44 City by city some of the villages some of the towns that they enter there's no resistance
01:44:10.16 --> 01:44:17.28 Some of them there is massive resistance they push through it. They fight through it lots of lessons learned lots of incredible
01:44:17.28 --> 01:44:19.28 Heroics and
01:44:19.28 --> 01:44:23.60 Eventually they push through and they make it all the way into
01:44:24.24 --> 01:44:26.24 Czechoslovakia
01:44:26.24 --> 01:44:28.24 and we're now
01:44:28.72 --> 01:44:30.72 approaching the end
01:44:30.72 --> 01:44:34.40 Not only for McDonald but the end for the war
01:44:35.84 --> 01:44:37.60 As they go into liberate
01:44:37.60 --> 01:44:41.84 Czechoslovakia going back to the book are column continued forward
01:44:43.04 --> 01:44:46.48 and my company shifted to the lead position on the tanks
01:44:47.20 --> 01:44:49.76 I wrote behind the lead tank in the artillery Jeep
01:44:50.64 --> 01:44:52.64 the little country towns changed into
01:44:53.44 --> 01:44:59.60 Industrial small industrial towns and we began to notice a scattering of red white and blue
01:44:59.60 --> 01:45:04.96 Czechoslovakian flags in towns in place of the usual white flags of surrender
01:45:06.08 --> 01:45:10.16 civilians waved at us guarded the from behind closed windows
01:45:11.60 --> 01:45:14.80 The scattering of Czech flags should have warned us
01:45:15.76 --> 01:45:20.88 but we were totally unprepared for the mad celebration which greeted us in the next town
01:45:21.84 --> 01:45:26.72 We had suddenly crossed from the Sudatinland into Czechoslovakia proper
01:45:26.72 --> 01:45:32.64 The houses were a riot of color with red white and blue Czechoslovakian flags
01:45:33.04 --> 01:45:37.84 civilians lying the streets ten deep cheering and waving their flags as if their lives
01:45:37.84 --> 01:45:38.64 depended on it
01:45:39.60 --> 01:45:43.92 Our column was forced to slow down and the happy civilians pushed into the street and
01:45:43.92 --> 01:45:46.08 showered us with flowers and cakes and cookies
01:45:47.20 --> 01:45:51.92 One old woman thrust a baked chicken to our Jeep another old woman stood behind the road
01:45:51.92 --> 01:45:56.40 beside the road waving both hands in the air tears streaming down her wrinkled cheeks
01:45:57.52 --> 01:46:03.04 Little children were wild with joy some of them had never known anything but six years of Nazi
01:46:03.04 --> 01:46:03.84 occupation
01:46:05.28 --> 01:46:12.16 The young men were red white and blue arm bands and carried German weapons apart of the underground movement that was now
01:46:12.88 --> 01:46:17.04 That was even now struggling against superior German forces in the capital city of Prague
01:46:17.04 --> 01:46:24.16 Everyone was screaming to the Czech words, Nazdar, Nazdar and we wondered what they meant
01:46:26.16 --> 01:46:31.28 I looked up and down the column at the soldiers in the company brilliant smiles to read their faces
01:46:32.16 --> 01:46:37.92 And they wave cheerfully at the shouting crowds as if they had just one election campaign and this was a personal triumph
01:46:39.20 --> 01:46:43.92 Hardened stubble faced veterans had unshamed tears in their eyes
01:46:43.92 --> 01:46:50.80 The unleash joy of these oppressed people knew no bounds and it was too much for us
01:46:52.96 --> 01:47:00.32 Suddenly I began to realize what no one thus far had been able in the war to put into words
01:47:01.68 --> 01:47:03.68 What we were fighting for
01:47:04.96 --> 01:47:06.96 And I found a lump in my throat
01:47:06.96 --> 01:47:13.68 Which I could not swallow
01:47:16.88 --> 01:47:18.88 Freedom
01:47:20.08 --> 01:47:22.08 Freedom
01:47:23.52 --> 01:47:25.52 Something we take for granted
01:47:27.68 --> 01:47:30.32 Back to the book the news came by radio
01:47:31.44 --> 01:47:33.44 That the war was over
01:47:33.44 --> 01:47:36.48 There was no defining our joy
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.48 Sergeant Quinn brought out a treasured
01:47:40.88 --> 01:47:42.88 Keg of Kognac
01:47:43.60 --> 01:47:46.96 The next day may eighth would be VE Day
01:47:48.80 --> 01:47:50.80 The towns people held a dance for us
01:47:51.76 --> 01:47:55.84 The next night in the town guest house one of the artillery men
01:47:56.80 --> 01:48:01.44 Was escorting a young girl whom he had met the night before and she told him
01:48:01.44 --> 01:48:03.44 That her friend leave
01:48:05.36 --> 01:48:07.76 Would like very much to attend with the captain
01:48:09.44 --> 01:48:17.68 The small guest house was crowded with dancers and the older men and women sat with the young children at tables around the sides of the room
01:48:19.60 --> 01:48:25.60 Mail dancers the male dancers were predominantly GIs but if you chucked check young men
01:48:25.60 --> 01:48:34.16 Were present the orchestra reminded me of the circus bands in the US as they played the waltses the polkas
01:48:35.52 --> 01:48:36.88 The checks would
01:48:37.12 --> 01:48:41.12 Join in often to sing the songs and enthusiastically even as they danced
01:48:43.20 --> 01:48:45.04 At the insistence of the band leader
01:48:45.04 --> 01:48:52.40 Leave a grand to agreed to sing and the note notes came forth in a clear sparkling soprano
01:48:52.40 --> 01:48:56.40 When she had finished she made a brief speech
01:48:57.60 --> 01:49:04.08 Which the Slavic speaking soldier told me said that the people would now sing their national anthem
01:49:05.68 --> 01:49:10.08 It would be the first time they had sung it in public in six years
01:49:10.08 --> 01:49:25.36 The people rose as one and every boy girl man and woman joined in the singing with clear lusty voices that made goose pimples rise on my arms
01:49:27.20 --> 01:49:32.08 Some of the older people cried and it was all I could do to keep the tears from my eyes
01:49:34.40 --> 01:49:37.76 When it was over the soldiers began to cry speech
01:49:37.76 --> 01:49:44.88 speech and the civilians called on and applauded. I stood up on a chair in the center of the room trying to think of something to say
01:49:45.92 --> 01:49:51.04 I'm on with a few words of sincere gratitude for the wonderful reception these wonderful people had given us
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.92 And the soldier translated for leave and she told the people what I had said
01:49:59.44 --> 01:50:01.44 They applauded warmly
01:50:01.44 --> 01:50:08.80 Leave and I walked outside into the cool night air in the distance we could see fireworks exploding in the air above Pilsson
01:50:08.80 --> 01:50:12.08 And we knew that they too were celebrating VE Day
01:50:14.40 --> 01:50:21.12 I looked around me and saw light streaming from the windows and army vehicles driving on the highway with their headlights on
01:50:21.12 --> 01:50:24.64 And I heard the game music and laughter from the dance in the background
01:50:24.64 --> 01:50:31.36 I suddenly realized that I could light a cigarette once again in the open and not be afraid of drawing enemy fire
01:50:32.48 --> 01:50:34.48 Then I did
01:50:35.12 --> 01:50:38.16 He was a simple thing, but it gave me a
01:50:38.80 --> 01:50:41.76 Wonderful feeling that life was worth living again
01:50:41.76 --> 01:50:51.92 I put my arm about leaves waste and she pointed to the multicolored fireworks display and laughed
01:50:52.24 --> 01:50:53.84 Dobry Dobry I
01:50:54.96 --> 01:51:01.92 Learned that Dobry was good and I said Dobry Dobry
01:51:01.92 --> 01:51:12.72 I looked away in the distance and I seemed to see the faces of the men from companies I and G
01:51:12.96 --> 01:51:17.60 Who could not see this great day because they had died to obtain it
01:51:19.84 --> 01:51:21.20 And then their faces were gone
01:51:22.32 --> 01:51:26.96 And I saw the mud and ice and snow of the secret secret line
01:51:26.96 --> 01:51:33.12 Then the exploding fireworks became bursting artillery shells in the art dents and bursting flack at leepeds
01:51:35.36 --> 01:51:37.36 But then
01:51:37.36 --> 01:51:39.36 The terror was gone
01:51:39.36 --> 01:51:47.12 And I saw two companies of men marching by and there was eye company and G company tired dirty
01:51:47.60 --> 01:51:48.80 Weary
01:51:48.80 --> 01:51:50.80 But with smiling faces
01:51:50.80 --> 01:51:58.24 And somehow the faces of the men who had been killed were in the background smiling and waving
01:51:58.24 --> 01:52:00.24 Bravely to those who marched on
01:52:03.20 --> 01:52:08.80 And leep looked up at me as if to ask what I was thinking and I said Dobry
01:52:09.60 --> 01:52:10.64 Dobry
01:52:12.24 --> 01:52:14.24 Then leep squeezed my hand and laughed
01:52:16.24 --> 01:52:17.76 Yes
01:52:17.76 --> 01:52:19.76 Dobry
01:52:21.84 --> 01:52:24.48 And that is the end of my story
01:52:25.76 --> 01:52:27.76 But perhaps
01:52:28.16 --> 01:52:34.48 You would like to know that my company moved on five miles north of Pilson to tremoltsa
01:52:35.84 --> 01:52:41.52 And there we met another group of dirty tired infantry men who called themselves Russians
01:52:41.52 --> 01:52:47.12 Among the later we were loaded on a big boat at Laharv
01:52:48.16 --> 01:52:52.80 And on July 20th, 1945 we sailed into New York Harbor
01:52:53.68 --> 01:52:56.80 And received the cheers of a grateful America
01:52:57.60 --> 01:53:02.32 And saw tall lady with a torch that brought tears to our eyes
01:53:02.32 --> 01:53:12.08 The characters in my story were destined to be sent to help to finish another war
01:53:12.08 --> 01:53:17.44 And another part of the world where another group of American infantry men were fighting a dirty
01:53:17.44 --> 01:53:18.72 Miserable war
01:53:21.12 --> 01:53:24.96 But a miracle happened and the other war came to an end
01:53:24.96 --> 01:53:33.76 Most of my characters are wearing civilian clothes again now
01:53:35.36 --> 01:53:37.68 But I know that wherever they are
01:53:39.28 --> 01:53:46.000 They will have a hollow place in their hearts for those who will not be changing into civilian clothes again
01:53:47.04 --> 01:53:48.56 Ever
01:53:50.48 --> 01:53:52.48 Those gays who
01:53:52.48 --> 01:53:54.88 That others may live
01:53:56.88 --> 01:54:02.96 Work cut down in a harvest for the devil
01:54:14.72 --> 01:54:15.28 And that
01:54:18.08 --> 01:54:18.48 Is
01:54:18.48 --> 01:54:21.28 How this book
01:54:22.16 --> 01:54:25.52 Raps up an incredible book again. It's called company commander
01:54:27.36 --> 01:54:28.88 by
01:54:29.68 --> 01:54:32.48 Charles B. McDonald and
01:54:37.12 --> 01:54:41.12 Although that is the end of this book
01:54:44.16 --> 01:54:46.48 Let it not be the end of our
01:54:46.48 --> 01:54:48.48 Memory
01:54:51.04 --> 01:54:52.72 Let us not forget these
01:54:53.92 --> 01:54:57.04 Lessons and let us not forget the tyranny
01:54:59.20 --> 01:55:04.16 And the oppression that was forced onto millions and millions of people
01:55:04.16 --> 01:55:15.60 And let us not forget the millions and millions and millions of innocent people
01:55:16.64 --> 01:55:18.40 Burger
01:55:18.40 --> 01:55:21.68 Butchered frozen star
01:55:24.24 --> 01:55:26.24 Weasted
01:55:28.16 --> 01:55:30.64 Weasted human lives
01:55:30.64 --> 01:55:36.56 To satisfy the twisted ego of a few
01:55:42.24 --> 01:55:46.40 And let us never forget these men
01:55:50.96 --> 01:55:55.44 That fought hunger and fatigue and fear
01:55:55.44 --> 01:56:03.04 To face and to fight evil
01:56:07.04 --> 01:56:09.04 And let us not
01:56:10.96 --> 01:56:14.80 Forget those that sacrificed their youth and their health
01:56:14.80 --> 01:56:24.64 For the youth and the health of others
01:56:27.28 --> 01:56:32.88 And finally let us never ever forget those men and women
01:56:34.88 --> 01:56:42.24 Who were cut down in this harvest for the devil to give other human beings
01:56:42.24 --> 01:56:46.40 The most precious gift in the world
01:56:51.20 --> 01:56:53.20 Freedom
01:56:57.12 --> 01:56:59.12 Let us never forget them
01:57:01.76 --> 01:57:04.08 Or this gift
01:57:04.08 --> 01:57:10.08 Freedom
01:57:16.48 --> 01:57:17.44 And I think that's
01:57:21.36 --> 01:57:23.20 All I've got for tonight
01:57:24.40 --> 01:57:25.36 Echo Charles
01:57:26.48 --> 01:57:29.60 If you want to maybe take a minute here and explain
01:57:29.60 --> 01:57:35.76 Give me a chance to dig and press over here and maybe you can explain in the meantime
01:57:36.88 --> 01:57:40.24 Somebody wants to support this particular podcast
01:57:41.44 --> 01:57:44.16 How they could do that it's crazy these books don't
01:57:45.12 --> 01:57:48.48 Like the effect of and obviously you never read the whole book
01:57:49.36 --> 01:57:58.16 But just what you read like the way it affects you, you know it takes you there and just even like at the end when it's like the world was over
01:57:58.16 --> 01:58:04.56 You feel like oh my gosh, thank god that's over kind of thing you have that feeling and it just never wears off it's crazy
01:58:05.60 --> 01:58:10.16 Yeah, oh I've said before you know when we when we started and I wasn't sure
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000 If I would have enough books
01:58:14.64 --> 01:58:19.68 Right yeah, but we're gonna have enough books and every single one of these
01:58:19.68 --> 01:58:27.60 Stories is it's own incredible story and and and because what I what we just talked about how you get this
01:58:28.88 --> 01:58:30.88 This war world war
01:58:30.88 --> 01:58:36.96 Two for this guy was this here, but you know you get someone that's in the Pacific and you take one if you
01:58:37.20 --> 01:58:43.04 Want to take one of his cartoon commanders it would be that war. It's these little tiny human experiences
01:58:43.60 --> 01:58:44.96 That are so
01:58:44.96 --> 01:58:51.28 Incredible and each one of them is as just as incredible as the next one as just as incredible as the previous one and
01:58:51.84 --> 01:58:57.76 That's why you just I just don't know if we'll ever get to them all and the other thing is that we have to remember is
01:58:58.96 --> 01:59:04.40 a tiny tiny tiny minuscule percentage of these people actually wrote a book yeah most of these stories
01:59:04.80 --> 01:59:06.80 They just
01:59:06.80 --> 01:59:09.52 They just happened and we don't know about it
01:59:09.52 --> 01:59:10.56 Yeah
01:59:10.56 --> 01:59:12.56 so crazy and
01:59:12.56 --> 01:59:20.16 Each one is like is so unique in their little perspective, but at the same time it has so many similarities, you know
01:59:20.16 --> 01:59:24.000 And it all sort of like as you gather, you know one story two stories all these things
01:59:24.16 --> 01:59:29.28 It starts to tell this overall tale, you know, yeah, and it's the tale of humans
01:59:29.28 --> 01:59:33.92 It's the tale of human nature it's the tale of and it's the tale of overcoming right?
01:59:33.92 --> 01:59:35.92 Yeah
01:59:35.92 --> 01:59:40.08 I mean just the things that these guys are coming you take all these things
01:59:40.08 --> 01:59:43.28 You know I've been I've been in some miserable places right in my time right?
01:59:43.84 --> 01:59:47.68 I mean everybody has you've been in some hard places in your life and
01:59:48.72 --> 01:59:50.72 Then these guys they do that and
01:59:51.20 --> 01:59:58.24 They live that way and then they get attacked and then they lose guys and they get wounded and then they just go right back out right back on to the front
01:59:59.04 --> 02:00:04.88 The limits of human nature are the limits of human the capacity of human beings to overcome
02:00:06.88 --> 02:00:08.08 obstacles
02:00:08.08 --> 02:00:10.08 is is is unbelievable and
02:00:10.88 --> 02:00:15.52 If there's nothing else like I know not everyone goes to war and not everyone should go to war
02:00:15.52 --> 02:00:17.52 And I don't want anyone to go to war if you can help it
02:00:18.48 --> 02:00:23.68 But if at least we learn that whatever we're coming up against man we can deal with it
02:00:23.92 --> 02:00:28.72 We can do so much more and be so much more comfortable and push yourself so much harder
02:00:28.80 --> 02:00:33.92 You know that was one thing and I didn't I didn't to a good job today of portraying it but
02:00:33.92 --> 02:00:38.96 He's getting pushed in a lot of these situations. I mean you can kind of hear when he's getting woken up
02:00:38.96 --> 02:00:42.96 Every time he wakes up his and is initial reaction isn't isn't cool
02:00:42.96 --> 02:00:47.52 I get to go fight now. No his initial reaction every single time is like I want to go back to bed
02:00:47.52 --> 02:00:53.52 I want the word to be over. I want to hide. I want to that's his reaction every single time and yet every single time
02:00:53.92 --> 02:00:59.12 He gets up and he does his job. He does his duty. He does what he has to do that's that's the human spirit
02:00:59.12 --> 02:01:01.60 Right that's the thing that we should all capture
02:01:01.60 --> 02:01:07.84 I mean we have a hard time getting out of bed because it's gonna be a tough workout or because we're gonna have a hard day at the
02:01:07.84 --> 02:01:10.80 Aw, you know it's like week we're we're we're pathetic
02:01:11.12 --> 02:01:16.000 We're pathetic compared to these guys that are oh it's you know it's waking you up a mortar fire
02:01:16.48 --> 02:01:21.52 Machine gun fire people screaming that they're being overrun. That's your wake-up call
02:01:22.08 --> 02:01:25.60 I think we can get out of bed in the morning because we you know because we got it
02:01:25.60 --> 02:01:29.36 We're facing a tough workout or a hard day. We got to get up early for travel or whatever
02:01:29.36 --> 02:01:36.64 Situation you're in you can do it. I can do it. We can do it look at what these guys went up against
02:01:36.64 --> 02:01:42.48 Day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day just doesn't stop
02:01:42.88 --> 02:01:46.96 It just doesn't stop and the whole time by the way there's the threat of death
02:01:47.68 --> 02:01:49.28 By the way the whole time
02:01:49.28 --> 02:01:53.44 Freezy you know I just thought about this like this is a book where he doesn't even talk about like his family
02:01:54.40 --> 02:01:56.96 He doesn't talk about his love. He's not no. He's there
02:01:56.96 --> 02:02:00.80 He's just like detached from everything else. He's got a water he's got a water fight
02:02:03.12 --> 02:02:08.40 So thankfully we get these incredible memoirs this one here if you're looking at on YouTube
02:02:09.04 --> 02:02:14.96 Holden up the cover. I got the old school version. It has illustrations and it got some cool ink drawings
02:02:16.08 --> 02:02:19.84 It's all of weapons just to kind of let you know what these things look like but
02:02:21.12 --> 02:02:23.12 Incredible stuff
02:02:23.12 --> 02:02:28.56 So yeah support right if you're in the mood. Yeah
02:02:30.40 --> 02:02:38.08 Like for instance how much effort does it take to click through Amazon it does take a lot of you could do it if you want to support
02:02:38.64 --> 02:02:43.36 Yeah, if you're in support in that way actually did I'm going to explain that Amazon things cool
02:02:45.76 --> 02:02:47.76 So
02:02:47.76 --> 02:02:50.000 You do your Amazon shopping like we always do
02:02:50.72 --> 02:02:51.76 daily
02:02:51.76 --> 02:02:53.76 For some of those
02:02:54.16 --> 02:03:01.04 Instead of going straight to Amazon just go to jocobotcast.com little Amazon banner on the side you kind of got to scroll down
02:03:01.92 --> 02:03:05.76 If you want to hit the banner sometimes, but I put it up in the top menu as well
02:03:06.32 --> 02:03:08.32 Boom click on the Amazon banner
02:03:08.96 --> 02:03:11.36 Then do your shopping good way to support
02:03:12.64 --> 02:03:17.60 Like jocos said just you know little actually do that if you want if if that's what you're doing if you're supporting the
02:03:17.60 --> 02:03:25.20 I'm gonna ask them. Are we asking them to assault a target are we asking them to flank an enemy or are we asking them to come up against
02:03:25.28 --> 02:03:30.32 Panzer tanks or tiger tanks with one bazooka and 10 tanks? No, no, no
02:03:30.32 --> 02:03:32.32 Asked for a little support
02:03:34.64 --> 02:03:37.12 Yeah, it's a good way to really good way
02:03:37.76 --> 02:03:39.04 It's
02:03:39.04 --> 02:03:45.12 Well, I was gonna make the comparison to the plane that comes in and then least you know, but meanwhile it's huge support
02:03:45.12 --> 02:03:50.96 But that's true let's face it though those pilots that's that's that's a lot of work. Oh, yeah, you know for sure
02:03:50.96 --> 02:03:53.52 So let's I mean, I don't know if that's a fair comparison
02:03:53.52 --> 02:03:55.52 But nonetheless
02:03:55.52 --> 02:04:00.76 Sticks with sodium all about what yeah, yeah, it's like sodium you know little peace sodium
02:04:00.80 --> 02:04:03.76 Throw it in the fish. You know what we should actually do that
02:04:04.88 --> 02:04:10.000 Yeah, we need to do it actually we need to do Facebook live we need to get some sodium and put it in
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:16.72 And walk bucket of water so we can give visuals behind the situation that you're talking about. Yeah, we'll do it at your house
02:04:16.72 --> 02:04:18.72 Okay bring it
02:04:19.60 --> 02:04:24.24 Where did you get sodium? I don't know like CBS you're the logistics guy
02:04:24.64 --> 02:04:31.04 Go get some sodium look into that one anyway that is a fair more fair analogy
02:04:31.12 --> 02:04:34.56 You're the sodium big reinforcement effects
02:04:34.56 --> 02:04:42.16 With the Amazon click through situation also if you're into supplementation which I'm gonna go ahead and recommend it now
02:04:43.28 --> 02:04:48.72 Catch me three years ago. You're not gonna hear me recommending any supplements. Maybe it pre-work out maybe
02:04:49.44 --> 02:04:52.40 And even then it's like caffeinated. I'll thinking you don't case. Oh
02:04:53.68 --> 02:04:56.48 On it right that's the supplements we're talking about if you didn't know
02:04:56.48 --> 02:05:05.04 If you did know this is often related to you, but the pre-workout that we talk about it's called total strength and performance
02:05:06.32 --> 02:05:12.16 You don't wait lifting what not it's pre-workout. It's not it's stimulant free, right? So you know what I was thinking
02:05:12.16 --> 02:05:17.36 I was like hey stimulant free pre-workout is kind of different than what I'm used to but you know what it's like
02:05:18.48 --> 02:05:23.52 I don't but I forgot a few of them in a London right it's like it's like you ever watch movies and
02:05:23.52 --> 02:05:29.84 The good guy like I don't know clean Eastwood yeah broke swillist like he's all calm
02:05:30.08 --> 02:05:32.56 He's like he's not wired and he's all calm
02:05:33.04 --> 02:05:35.04 But when it goes down
02:05:35.04 --> 02:05:40.24 Bro he kills you know kick sass that's what this pre-workout is kind of like when you take it you're like
02:05:40.24 --> 02:05:45.84 Oh, I'm calm but on the inside so much protect and then when you get the work going it's like boom
02:05:46.24 --> 02:05:51.44 So that they do studies on it that's actually the good one of the good parts about it
02:05:51.44 --> 02:05:59.76 It's like they do real like placebo tested like that studies double blind placebo tested. Yeah stuff like that yeah sounds cool, but it is cool
02:06:01.44 --> 02:06:07.12 So with this pre-workout on it's like over I think it was like a four week period it's like
02:06:08.08 --> 02:06:13.92 I want to say 6% improvement on like on that about there. You know and I'm thinking oh yeah 6% okay
02:06:14.72 --> 02:06:16.72 Cool single digit percent
02:06:16.72 --> 02:06:21.68 Sometimes that can mean a lot some like thinking okay, what's 6% what does that look like you know
02:06:22.32 --> 02:06:24.48 Something add that to your bench press number or whatever
02:06:24.48 --> 02:06:29.94 But that's your deadlift number how but this subtract it so this is this is how it really
02:06:29.94 --> 02:06:34.48 He's got to be negative. I know it because I'm trying to prove it but I would really dream it point
02:06:35.20 --> 02:06:37.20 Okay, so let's say I'm
02:06:38.80 --> 02:06:40.80 Doing some dumbbells right?
02:06:41.36 --> 02:06:45.20 I'm like okay. I'm gonna do a set of 10. I don't know. I'm not saying me. I'm just saying anyone and
02:06:45.20 --> 02:06:48.64 I'm gonna use the hundred pound dumbbells. I'm gonna do 10 up on crows
02:06:49.84 --> 02:06:51.84 We'll do how about this we'll do a
02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.72 Bit of bench press dumbbells. Yeah, I'm doing hundreds and
02:06:55.92 --> 02:07:01.92 One week I do you know set a 10 boom solid right and then whatever I finish my workout the next week
02:07:02.48 --> 02:07:04.80 If I can do 6% less
02:07:06.16 --> 02:07:12.44 Like that's my limit, you know, I'm I'm feeling 6% weaker. Yeah, I can't do those hundreds 10 times
02:07:12.44 --> 02:07:17.16 No, I got to go to the 95. You probably you know what whack that is. It's real wet
02:07:18.92 --> 02:07:23.16 So I'm saying if you don't take this pre workout over a month period of time
02:07:23.40 --> 02:07:26.28 This is just on average if you don't take this pre workout
02:07:26.28 --> 02:07:30.36 You're the guy who did the 95s if you do you're the guy who did the hundreds
02:07:30.68 --> 02:07:34.20 Actually it's less than 95s really it's like 94s really
02:07:35.40 --> 02:07:38.60 On average dang see so that's what if you're not taking the pre workout
02:07:38.60 --> 02:07:42.60 Which I do now by the way if you're not taking it you're that guy
02:07:43.40 --> 02:07:47.80 No, I mean that's cool, but I'm just saying you're missing out on gains galore, you know
02:07:48.36 --> 02:07:50.36 I didn't see them say
02:07:50.36 --> 02:07:55.64 You know, and this is all proven stuff. This is just me making it up. It's like proof they do they did it floor state university
02:07:56.52 --> 02:07:58.52 Against you prove it yourself
02:07:58.52 --> 02:08:03.96 Yeah, that part is up to you. I mean it's it's up to you to go get after it. No, what about you personally?
02:08:03.96 --> 02:08:08.84 Yeah, I'm I'm all up at all upon it. I didn't measure it might result or nothing like that
02:08:09.40 --> 02:08:14.44 I just do a bloodline yeah, yeah the pot remember. Oh, that's right pop this real
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:20.68 How they did it is you know, you know even the the word double blind plus seat or placebo
02:08:21.48 --> 02:08:29.80 Situation whatever like a lot of people they know what that is what it is is they get a bunch of group of people who are gonna work out hard going for games straight up
02:08:29.80 --> 02:08:35.32 They're gonna give them all the supplements all of them all the people they're gonna give this supplement
02:08:35.32 --> 02:08:39.32 But half of those people it's actually not the supplement. It's like nothing
02:08:40.28 --> 02:08:44.60 But they don't know that everyone thinks they're taking the supplements so they're all getting after it
02:08:44.60 --> 02:08:46.92 They're all you know, I mean yeah, and then they say okay
02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:54.12 Who's gonna who's gains are better and they monitor and all the people with the supplements their gains were you know on average and it's all these different
02:08:54.12 --> 02:08:56.44 Let's be a squad all this stuff. So won't prove it
02:08:56.44 --> 02:09:02.52 You know it tastes good that much I can actually attest to I can attest that it makes
02:09:03.64 --> 02:09:07.24 Now I can't I haven't done a double blind placebo on myself
02:09:07.80 --> 02:09:12.84 Because I would have to like mix it up and fake myself out and I'm pretty hard to trick
02:09:12.84 --> 02:09:16.60 Yeah, so but like I said I
02:09:17.08 --> 02:09:19.08 When I feel the need
02:09:19.08 --> 02:09:28.28 I take not only shrimp tech sport, but also the pre yeah and get after it. Yeah, if I know that the boys are waiting for me
02:09:28.28 --> 02:09:31.32 For those you get to training. Yeah, and I know it's going down
02:09:32.52 --> 02:09:36.68 I will if I'm not if I'm feeling any sort of hesitation
02:09:37.24 --> 02:09:43.24 I'll get after that you fault the aggressive went and doubt yeah, and it makes sense too because obviously
02:09:43.24 --> 02:09:48.84 You just too special when you're going hard. That's a workout of that you need to recover from and you'll be you know
02:09:49.56 --> 02:09:51.56 So you'll get better
02:09:51.96 --> 02:09:56.60 Results from recovering from even at you just to workout. Yeah, you know, I just worry about
02:09:56.92 --> 02:10:00.20 Performance yeah, yeah, performing I'm not doing it for recovery to be honest with you
02:10:00.76 --> 02:10:03.40 With the jitz who work out, but like it or not that's what you're getting
02:10:04.60 --> 02:10:06.60 Yeah, fully please
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.52 But yeah, so good yeah, you say taste good does taste good
02:10:10.52 --> 02:10:15.88 It was weird because um it's for his pre workout. Let's go like if you get a regular quote. I'm quote regular pre workout
02:10:15.88 --> 02:10:22.28 They try to make it taste like candy and cool-aid and yeah, I'm in aid and all this stuff and I'm not mad at it. It tastes good or whatever
02:10:22.28 --> 02:10:25.96 I'm out but yeah, man. Let's face it. I ain't this style. Oh, good
02:10:26.20 --> 02:10:31.32 So when I took this one it was kind of it had more of like a um you know like if you take like natural greens
02:10:31.32 --> 02:10:35.80 Or yeah, it kind of has a earthy it's earthy earthy
02:10:35.80 --> 02:10:41.56 There's a earthy flavor to it which I was like oh, this is different. It's not like candy and I was like okay
02:10:41.56 --> 02:10:45.80 And then after a while you kind of get used to it and then you have that a see you know you have that association
02:10:45.80 --> 02:10:47.40 It's certain tastes from like
02:10:47.56 --> 02:10:50.76 Then you go workout you get the pop and it's like kind of part of the routine
02:10:51.16 --> 02:10:52.84 So it's like tastes all good now
02:10:52.84 --> 02:10:55.32 You know I mean it's like your association. Yeah, yeah
02:10:55.32 --> 02:10:56.44 Good
02:10:56.44 --> 02:10:59.16 Anyway, it doesn't taste like krill oil like if you're chopping
02:10:59.24 --> 02:11:02.92 Chomping krill oil tablet. Yeah, you got to just swallow those don't chunk those
02:11:02.92 --> 02:11:07.72 That's do not taste good. Yeah, so then cool. So krill oil speaking of which is
02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.40 The go to in my opinion. It's the go to I was talking to Greg train about this
02:11:14.04 --> 02:11:16.84 It's today. It was the yesterday. I was talking to him
02:11:18.52 --> 02:11:23.56 And of course like okay if you're working out and you're like hey my joints are less sore
02:11:23.64 --> 02:11:25.64 That's good of course
02:11:26.20 --> 02:11:29.80 But you know when you do notice it and in my experience even more
02:11:29.80 --> 02:11:36.76 If you pay attention is like for like like two few days ago I'm sitting down on the living room with like the kids
02:11:36.84 --> 02:11:40.76 You know we're seeing we're sitting there for a long time same positions like for 45 minutes
02:11:41.80 --> 02:11:44.92 Usually after 45 minutes and so okay it's time to get up whatever
02:11:45.48 --> 02:11:50.36 Do something you get up and you're like ah, you know you get up, you know you make that nice
02:11:51.88 --> 02:11:54.52 Me no, but if I didn't take krill oil
02:11:54.52 --> 02:11:59.96 I probably would have that and I have had that especially if you've worked out that day or something like that, you know
02:11:59.96 --> 02:12:05.32 You just stiffen up. I'm just saying and you feel it with the krill oil. It's almost like you're always warm, you know
02:12:05.80 --> 02:12:09.48 Not warm physically, but you know like you already warmed up. That's kind of what you feel like
02:12:10.28 --> 02:12:12.68 It's good. I'm a supporter. Yeah
02:12:13.32 --> 02:12:17.64 So I'm saying get in the krill oil. Yeah, like I said I had injuries and
02:12:17.64 --> 02:12:23.96 And krill oil that was a long time ago that I started taking krill oil and I haven't stopped and I'm not going to yeah
02:12:24.36 --> 02:12:26.36 Yeah, because even like
02:12:26.36 --> 02:12:31.32 Like you say injuries which yeah, of course legitimate, but I never I mean I've had injuries but
02:12:33.24 --> 02:12:37.20 It more helps like the pre-injury, you know like something that's
02:12:37.20 --> 02:12:43.72 Not an injury. Yeah, something that's just kind of just nagging you you know stuff you got to like battle through or something like that
02:12:43.72 --> 02:12:45.24 You know how to battle through that anymore
02:12:45.24 --> 02:12:47.24 You got you got old made a threes
02:12:49.32 --> 02:12:51.32 Next time I'll go into the whole why
02:12:51.88 --> 02:12:56.76 Fish oil or krill oil is better than fish oil because we talked about it. I've had it take too long. It's kind of technical
02:12:56.76 --> 02:12:59.32 I'll put it into like some other time anyway
02:13:00.28 --> 02:13:02.28 Krill oil is dope
02:13:02.04 --> 02:13:04.04 pre-workouts dope
02:13:04.04 --> 02:13:06.76 Everything on it is good actually
02:13:06.76 --> 02:13:11.72 Just depends on what kind of workout program or kind of lifestyle, you know, but they have something for everybody
02:13:11.72 --> 02:13:15.40 Like we're gonna do even the krill oil even if you're not that active
02:13:15.40 --> 02:13:20.28 It's just good for your joints, you know as like because over time you teach generate, you know whatever
02:13:20.68 --> 02:13:22.68 krill oil regenerate
02:13:23.80 --> 02:13:29.08 Also, another way to support is subscribe on iTunes or the various
02:13:29.72 --> 02:13:35.88 Podcast platforms stitcher Google play all these things if you subscribe you haven't already, you know that's a good support, you know
02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.64 Get updates when new episodes come up
02:13:40.36 --> 02:13:41.64 Also on YouTube
02:13:41.64 --> 02:13:47.80 Whether YouTube channel excerpts on there along with the video version of this podcast which helps
02:13:49.24 --> 02:13:55.96 If you need to know what echo looks like because apparently echo does not look like what he sounds like yeah, I've been told
02:13:56.68 --> 02:13:58.68 Actually how this is it so
02:13:59.96 --> 02:14:01.96 Paul
02:14:02.52 --> 02:14:06.84 New friend Paul came in from Arizona visit it came to the V victory
02:14:06.84 --> 02:14:13.16 Looked into some jujuts on that I was not tell you're out of town. Yeah, too bad. So he goes he says
02:14:13.56 --> 02:14:17.000 When I walked in he's like, hey echo that's like, I was like hey, you know what's up?
02:14:18.20 --> 02:14:23.88 And he goes oh you're I for some reason I thought you'd be bigger. He said
02:14:24.68 --> 02:14:27.40 I was like all interesting. I was like because typically
02:14:28.04 --> 02:14:33.88 People will if they haven't seen me or whatever. They think I'm smaller and you think I'm bigger so it's kind of
02:14:33.88 --> 02:14:39.88 I'm just different even I got that impression from reading on social media that echo's jacked
02:14:43.08 --> 02:14:48.12 Maybe people go echo's jacked or yeah or maybe you know
02:14:48.52 --> 02:14:52.36 Maybe thought I was just taught like super taller something oh yeah
02:14:52.92 --> 02:14:56.20 Well, maybe but you what do you five eleven six eleven
02:14:58.20 --> 02:15:00.20 Super tall
02:15:00.20 --> 02:15:08.12 Normal I don't know either way um what was the point there? Oh yeah if you want to watch YouTube videos of of
02:15:08.76 --> 02:15:15.48 Jockel yeah, it's less about me. I think that's about me. Yeah a little bit. Yeah, so either of us
02:15:16.52 --> 02:15:20.52 And you want to watch a video version go ahead watch that man. It's good. It's on YouTube and also
02:15:20.92 --> 02:15:24.04 I'll put some excerpts on there. It doesn't get you to watch the whole
02:15:24.04 --> 02:15:29.56 To sit in front of the computer and watch like for two hours three hours sometimes. I mean that's kind of unrealistic
02:15:30.52 --> 02:15:33.96 Unless you're not doing it. Yeah, well, no, what what
02:15:34.92 --> 02:15:40.04 And I've done this before too. You just put it on like your TV. Yeah, but sometimes I want to see
02:15:40.60 --> 02:15:46.84 What is going on in the podcast? I want to see the look on my own face or on your face when I say something
02:15:46.84 --> 02:15:51.40 I'm kind of gonna see what that looks like yeah, yeah, and that makes sense because when you figure I mean
02:15:51.40 --> 02:15:57.88 I feel like a lot of people watch a less TV, but that could be just my little bubble, but no one watches TV
02:15:57.88 --> 02:16:02.44 We all are yeah, no one has to walk. No, but I think about the Hawaii five oh
02:16:04.76 --> 02:16:09.08 Yeah, that's a good for sure, but let's say you watch I don't know doctor fill
02:16:10.68 --> 02:16:17.16 Not that I watch doctor fill, but if you watch that's all they're doing they're sitting this guy's talking to this person and you're just watching
02:16:17.16 --> 02:16:23.64 You could listen to that you're saying I'm just saying if you're into doctor fill that the difference between looking and
02:16:23.96 --> 02:16:25.96 And watching it and just listening to it like
02:16:26.76 --> 02:16:31.000 You understand that people actually do watch two people talk about stuff makes sense
02:16:32.28 --> 02:16:36.36 You kind of feel like you'd be more in the conversation in a way. I don't know either way
02:16:37.64 --> 02:16:42.52 YouTube that's the that's the point there if you if you want to watch this podcast or just the excerpts
02:16:42.52 --> 02:16:49.08 And you don't want to watch the whole podcast there's little excerpts a little lessons that I kind of separate from the podcast
02:16:49.08 --> 02:16:51.08 Put them on there shareable
02:16:51.08 --> 02:16:53.56 Little nuggets also
02:16:53.80 --> 02:16:55.80 We have a store jocosdoor.com
02:16:56.44 --> 02:16:59.08 If you like shirts and whatnot new designs
02:16:59.96 --> 02:17:05.56 I don't know a week next week. We'll have them. I think new designs. Yeah, that's cool
02:17:05.56 --> 02:17:12.12 Yeah, kind of listen to the crowd a little bit you know people throw out suggestions all the time which you know
02:17:12.52 --> 02:17:14.52 Listen to for sure and
02:17:15.16 --> 02:17:22.12 Kind of the ones that what he could hate you when we're that percolate first. I like the word percolate better than resonate
02:17:23.16 --> 02:17:28.04 The one that resonate with my soul, you know that feeling that's what the feeling I get one
02:17:28.04 --> 02:17:33.48 Okay, one I say it one other people say it sounds cool. I just say the ones that are good
02:17:33.48 --> 02:17:36.36 Yeah, that makes my sense for sure
02:17:37.24 --> 02:17:38.84 All right, yeah, the ones that we thought are good
02:17:39.72 --> 02:17:43.32 We're starting to develop more and more designs and have a
02:17:44.20 --> 02:17:49.48 So yeah, jocosdoor.com and and you know women stuff is on there some patches some shirts of course
02:17:49.96 --> 02:17:53.32 Brashguard see this is what this is the thing see I'm not good
02:17:54.44 --> 02:17:55.24 At
02:17:55.24 --> 02:17:59.72 Recognizing like hey we should make more stuff because I
02:17:59.72 --> 02:18:05.96 It's hard for me to recognize what's good and what's bad because my mind is different than some people's yeah
02:18:06.28 --> 02:18:12.36 So but what's cool is when I do see something and I do think it's good. It's pretty good
02:18:14.04 --> 02:18:16.04 Yeah, I
02:18:16.04 --> 02:18:22.92 Almost done with the echo Charles t-shirt design by the way. Yeah, which I think people are gonna like
02:18:23.96 --> 02:18:27.48 And you know why they're gonna like it because you designed it well
02:18:27.48 --> 02:18:31.16 Yeah, but but that's not why they're gonna like it because it's not just straightforward
02:18:33.16 --> 02:18:35.64 Yes, you could that's it some layers
02:18:37.64 --> 02:18:40.36 I believe right you're the you're the original layer
02:18:41.08 --> 02:18:43.48 Creator really when it comes down to it
02:18:44.36 --> 02:18:49.16 And no, I think that is good. I'm funny so speaking of layers the day that echo asked me
02:18:50.52 --> 02:18:56.28 What font it was that I used to write jocopodcast and I was like yeah, it's OCR standard
02:18:56.28 --> 02:19:01.56 And then he kind of looked at me and I said it's because it's a machine can read it and you know
02:19:01.56 --> 02:19:03.56 This is like part machine here
02:19:03.80 --> 02:19:05.80 And he was all excited but they are right there
02:19:07.32 --> 02:19:10.84 Telling you the layers are real and I respect them
02:19:11.40 --> 02:19:14.68 Good so yeah, there it is jocostor also
02:19:16.12 --> 02:19:20.44 Oh, yeah, sorry, right this rash cards on there alleged 19%
02:19:21.72 --> 02:19:24.76 Straight up 19% increase improvement performance
02:19:24.76 --> 02:19:25.80 Results
02:19:25.80 --> 02:19:33.000 Results all that stuff who he's on there to and you know like I said more stuff that we have a travel mug coming out now. It's gonna be good
02:19:34.20 --> 02:19:36.20 Well, let you know when that's uh
02:19:36.20 --> 02:19:38.52 a little bit of a cycle psychological warfare
02:19:39.88 --> 02:19:42.76 I feel like I should talk about that right now. I feel like we can't stop you
02:19:42.76 --> 02:19:45.32 So yeah, I guess you won't go for it. Can't stop me
02:19:46.36 --> 02:19:51.72 So psychological warfare on iTunes is in album with tracks
02:19:51.72 --> 02:19:56.60 And this is what it's for it's not music
02:19:57.16 --> 02:19:59.48 No, this is what it's for it
02:19:59.48 --> 02:20:02.92 It's technically it's considered spoken word
02:20:03.72 --> 02:20:13.80 This is what it is if you're feeling a moment of weakness in your discorse that I use that word right your discorse is not really yeah, so in your course
02:20:15.80 --> 02:20:18.68 Better closer in your journey in your
02:20:18.68 --> 02:20:27.88 ambitious goals to stay on the program in whatever capacity right wake up early get the workout in hard workout in
02:20:29.56 --> 02:20:36.28 You know create you know right your book your blog your yeah anything you're doing right more or less
02:20:36.84 --> 02:20:39.64 And you're feeling moments of weakness you're slipping from the path
02:20:40.20 --> 02:20:45.32 Taking a break when you shouldn't be taking a break scheduling unscheduled rest days
02:20:45.32 --> 02:20:49.72 Yeah, when you're feeling like like that string from the war path. Yeah
02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:57.24 You listen to one of these designated tracks and it'll help you get past that weakness in that moment
02:21:00.28 --> 02:21:03.96 I would say and I've said this before it is
02:21:05.32 --> 02:21:11.40 This my guess 100% chance that it'll get you through your weakness 100% chance
02:21:11.40 --> 02:21:15.000 And this is why I say that and I'm said this before but I think it's worth saying again
02:21:15.96 --> 02:21:21.64 Because if you let's say you know, let's do the the wake though the workout one that's the most common one to me and
02:21:22.12 --> 02:21:25.56 I'm like okay, I'm gonna work out. I don't feel like working out and I'm saying okay
02:21:25.56 --> 02:21:32.36 Well, I'm gonna put it in workout track whatever with the one I listen to it and after I'm done listening to it's like two minutes
02:21:32.36 --> 02:21:39.72 So and I still skip the workout that's like a shame that's an unbearable shame and it's all personal
02:21:39.72 --> 02:21:43.08 So that means it's not 100% if you still skip the workout
02:21:43.08 --> 02:21:51.32 I'm just trying to imagine it. That were to have it. I've never done it and the shame the unbearable shame is so unbearable that it just simply wouldn't happen
02:21:51.32 --> 02:21:54.52 You know, so that's why I say 100% chance
02:21:54.52 --> 02:21:56.52 I don't think I can't imagine a person
02:21:56.76 --> 02:21:59.24 That would actually let that happen nonetheless
02:21:59.40 --> 02:22:05.72 So whatever you think your weakness is waking up early all this stuff if you do the wake up early one and you set it as your alarm
02:22:05.72 --> 02:22:09.72 Which is a good idea by the way. Yeah, it's actually that's the perfect idea
02:22:10.44 --> 02:22:12.44 Just clear it with your your
02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:18.44 Spouse significant other significant other. Yeah, if they're sleeping in the same bed or whatever and they have the potential to hear it
02:22:18.44 --> 02:22:24.76 There's some dude in the bedroom. Yeah, yeah, just like all of a sudden starts talking and it's chocolate. It's like a spot
02:22:24.76 --> 02:22:26.84 You know, it's good psychological warfare
02:22:26.84 --> 02:22:27.88 I think
02:22:27.88 --> 02:22:31.64 Chocolate will get so I also on Amazon using it on these other things. So yeah, it's there
02:22:31.64 --> 02:22:36.92 It's a good way to support and support yourself that that'll support yourself situation for sure
02:22:38.68 --> 02:22:41.32 And actually what's cool now right now we're getting requests
02:22:42.44 --> 02:22:44.92 For psychological warfare two
02:22:45.80 --> 02:22:51.80 What topics need to be covered? Yeah, that I didn't cover on the first one. Yeah, there's more weaknesses out there in the world
02:22:52.12 --> 02:22:56.36 weaknesses that are creeping around and they're trying to get people but
02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:00.44 Yeah, we're gonna drink in and find some of them weaknesses and we're gonna smash them
02:23:00.44 --> 02:23:03.56 So yeah, if you got any more suggestions just hit it up, you know
02:23:04.28 --> 02:23:08.92 We didn't smoke in how about that one right? It's a good one. Do people still smoke?
02:23:09.32 --> 02:23:13.24 Bro, I you know what's what I brought thinking about we live in California. That's one of the things
02:23:13.24 --> 02:23:16.60 Yeah, we live in California California California a lot of people don't smoke anymore
02:23:16.60 --> 02:23:20.12 Yeah, it's not real popular out here anymore. Yeah, so just like um, bro
02:23:20.12 --> 02:23:25.08 I'm telling we live in a bubble not only being in California, but just think about the people you hang around with you know
02:23:25.08 --> 02:23:30.28 It's like all the sheels. Yeah, 90 seals. Do you get guys who at the very least have like
02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:37.16 Some level of health and it's exactly so yeah, it's weird. I saw a guy smoking in his car and I was like
02:23:37.72 --> 02:23:40.76 The same thing. I was like dang. I didn't know really people smoke anymore
02:23:40.76 --> 02:23:43.72 Well, I realized that when I go to another state. Yes, and
02:23:44.36 --> 02:23:47.72 You go into a restaurant or something because it's illegal here. You can't smoke in a restaurant
02:23:47.72 --> 02:23:50.92 You can't smoke in a bar here. You can't do it. Do you legal. It's literally illegal. Yeah, so
02:23:50.92 --> 02:23:56.28 Yeah, so yeah, you go to another state and you smell cigarette. Oh, yeah, I remember that back
02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.76 Yeah, that'd be good. I think yeah, okay. Well, we'll think about that one
02:24:04.12 --> 02:24:09.48 Yeah, I don't know if I could legally do it though because I didn't smoke and I don't know what it takes
02:24:09.72 --> 02:24:12.04 I don't know if it's proper for me to do that
02:24:12.04 --> 02:24:18.52 I mean, I guess I could just get nuts of smoke. Yeah, because I mean, it's a horrible thing that kills you it shouldn't be doing it
02:24:18.52 --> 02:24:24.84 Man, I use it. There's actually no benefit from it, right? There's no I mean if you're doing steroids
02:24:25.40 --> 02:24:29.08 There's some benefit to it. Right. You're gonna get stronger if you're doing
02:24:29.72 --> 02:24:35.64 caffeine you're gonna be more awake, so there's some benefits. Is there any benefits? Well, it depends on what you mean by gender
02:24:35.64 --> 02:24:37.80 Spits before I've never even tried
02:24:38.12 --> 02:24:42.52 A puff of the cigarette before because you're from Hawaii. Well, that's not the reason
02:24:42.52 --> 02:24:50.28 People smoke no, it was the thing is thing with my dad. He he literally refer to it as the devil like he'd be like smoke
02:24:50.28 --> 02:24:57.48 It's that devil and it was it was a shame thing to so the way he would talk about smoking not necessarily the people that smoke
02:24:57.64 --> 02:25:04.04 But that smoking is yeah, it's just so it just to me in my mind according to his little
02:25:04.04 --> 02:25:07.88 That's cool. That's so you're dead. It's a good job there. Yeah, yeah, I never tried
02:25:07.88 --> 02:25:12.52 Yeah, anyway, he should have told you sleep was the devil to did you out of the bed
02:25:12.52 --> 02:25:15.80 Well, that's a thing. I know
02:25:16.04 --> 02:25:19.64 Yeah, that's my it's I think it's there is benefits though
02:25:19.88 --> 02:25:24.20 Depends on what you mean by benefits though health benefits of any kind
02:25:24.76 --> 02:25:27.88 It gives you like this this like buzz and alerting
02:25:27.88 --> 02:25:31.96 But here's the thing about so it's weird because if you say smoking smoking
02:25:31.96 --> 02:25:41.56 Cigarettes there's nicotine in it and there's benefits in nicotine but smoking also has all the carbon dioxide like tar all these like
02:25:41.56 --> 02:25:44.60 Yeah, carcinogens and stuff like that. Yeah, so smoking
02:25:47.24 --> 02:25:53.64 Maybe not so much benefits nicotine. There are benefits. Okay. Well, let's just say no I say no
02:25:53.64 --> 02:26:00.12 There are no benefits. So that's a net benefit no negative all right and
02:26:00.36 --> 02:26:08.28 Let's see also speaking of net benefit you can get some net benefit if you want to try something called jocquite
02:26:08.84 --> 02:26:12.92 If you're not a T drink or don't worry because it doesn't taste like T tastes like victory here
02:26:13.88 --> 02:26:19.24 And you know don't take my word for it. I got some reviews. We got some we got a bunch of reviews on Amazon
02:26:19.24 --> 02:26:22.44 And you know what they're all awesome. They're all 12 star right?
02:26:24.12 --> 02:26:31.08 So here's one after drinking one comp of this balanced and delicious T. I was able to execute a flying triangle on my black belt
02:26:31.08 --> 02:26:34.52 Jiu-Jitsu instructor while discovering the mystery behind dark matter in the universe
02:26:34.84 --> 02:26:40.68 It actually isn't dark matter. It's a combination of jocquite's chin and echo Charles's biceps
02:26:41.40 --> 02:26:45.48 altering the gravitational field from random celestial bodies
02:26:45.48 --> 02:26:51.96 So you know there's some good stuff here. I can't speak to deadlift performance
02:26:51.96 --> 02:26:56.60 But when I can't comment as the significant increase in production while performing farm work
02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:03.64 Most noticeably I can dig post holes in hard southern clay and half the normal time while under the influence of jocquite
02:27:03.64 --> 02:27:11.000 T tastes great now highly recommend it for farmers land scalpers construction workers workers or anyone who wants to get after it
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:17.40 So I didn't you know I wasn't familiar with that. Well you do notice right now like the economies improving a lot
02:27:17.40 --> 02:27:22.36 We're like you know everything is getting better. I think it's a lot of people are drinking jocquite. They're working harder
02:27:22.36 --> 02:27:27.56 Yeah, yeah, so that you're saying quarterly you're not necessarily saying I'm not saying it's a fact. I'm just saying it's factual
02:27:29.88 --> 02:27:31.88 And you know this guy here
02:27:32.52 --> 02:27:35.64 bought this from my wife. She's five to 120 pounds
02:27:35.64 --> 02:27:42.44 She was deadlifting 250 pounds by the way. That's double body weight already impressive after a week of
02:27:42.44 --> 02:27:46.68 Inbibing this fine product her deadlift suddenly increased to
02:27:47.16 --> 02:27:49.80 1,250 pounds now
02:27:50.68 --> 02:27:52.68 That might seem like a lot
02:27:54.12 --> 02:27:59.72 But it's it happened right it's right there. I mean this has been documented on Amazon reviews
02:27:59.72 --> 02:28:05.72 Yeah, I'm gonna be too we started throwing jocquite tags in
02:28:06.44 --> 02:28:08.60 500 gallon water tank on the fire truck
02:28:09.56 --> 02:28:12.28 Little known fact jocquite tears three times a weather
02:28:14.68 --> 02:28:20.76 You're now extinguishing fires three times faster and in the process anyone on scene who gets sprayed immediately
02:28:20.76 --> 02:28:25.000 Starts getting after it so there's a little side effect, but it's a positive side effects. Yeah, negative
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:30.60 That you're putting out the fire someone say it's hit with some water by accident. They're not gonna complain
02:28:30.60 --> 02:28:32.60 They're starting to improve
02:28:33.48 --> 02:28:39.72 We got a warning here to aggressive do not drink at work literally lip the ripped the door trim off the wall after
02:28:39.72 --> 02:28:42.44 Consuming this victory in a glass luckily
02:28:42.92 --> 02:28:47.56 Since getting after it is my new default mode I was able to repair the damage before the boss noticed
02:28:48.76 --> 02:28:52.68 Replace pathetic this is my best part out of the best part of this one replaced
02:28:52.68 --> 02:28:58.28 Pathetic screws with lag bolts, you know lag bolts are they're like instead of a screw
02:28:58.28 --> 02:29:03.16 Which is like a little tiny pencil thing a lag bolt is a big bolt that you like surreal. Yeah
02:29:04.20 --> 02:29:07.000 That's what you that's your mind. Yeah, it's now I
02:29:08.28 --> 02:29:14.04 Mention this before and I don't know if I should necessarily do this but I kind of think I should
02:29:14.04 --> 02:29:20.36 God there's a poem that someone wrote about jocquite tea and it's based on the
02:29:20.36 --> 02:29:23.08 Poem infantry columns by kippling
02:29:23.96 --> 02:29:29.88 This one is talking about jocquite tea probably worth talking about here. Yes, so we'll go
02:29:31.16 --> 02:29:32.52 Here we go

02:30:41.56 --> 02:30:48.76 So just when someone writes a review like that
02:30:49.56 --> 02:30:53.96 I think that might be the best in that fact. Let's just face it. That's the best review that's ever
02:30:53.96 --> 02:31:00.28 But I don't understand was so good on you. That's the best review. That was very impressive. Yeah, it was very impressive
02:31:00.92 --> 02:31:04.60 And so that's that also if you want to pre order a
02:31:05.96 --> 02:31:07.96 Little book coming out called way of the war your kid
02:31:07.96 --> 02:31:09.96 And
02:31:09.96 --> 02:31:15.56 You can order it and I'll tell you why this book you might be wondering what this book is about
02:31:17.56 --> 02:31:19.56 This book is about everything
02:31:20.44 --> 02:31:23.08 So I want to read a little excerpt to you
02:31:24.68 --> 02:31:30.28 Young Mark remember the beginning of the book you could do zero pull-ups. Do not do any pull-ups. What's this strong enough?
02:31:30.28 --> 02:31:34.52 Now he works through the summer his uncle Jake is showing him looks and good workout programs
02:31:34.52 --> 02:31:40.44 And finally he's built up over the summer goes through some platoes gets through them
02:31:40.84 --> 02:31:45.56 Getting after it training hard finally towards the end of summer he gets his first day of doing 10 pull-ups
02:31:46.20 --> 02:31:49.40 Right and so here's what happens we're going back to the book
02:31:50.76 --> 02:31:52.04 And that was it
02:31:52.04 --> 02:31:56.68 I was now officially a kid who can do 10 pull-ups no more hiding from the pull-up bar in school
02:31:56.84 --> 02:31:59.88 No more being embarrassed about being weak. This was real
02:31:59.88 --> 02:32:03.48 As I thought about this I looked at uncle Jake and said thanks
02:32:04.92 --> 02:32:11.56 No problem Mark and I want you to remember something this isn't just about pull-ups you know what else this is about
02:32:12.28 --> 02:32:13.88 right
02:32:13.88 --> 02:32:15.88 I wasn't quite sure I don't know
02:32:16.60 --> 02:32:23.40 Uncle Jake grabbed me by both shoulders and looked me straight in the eyes and said gravely this is about everything
02:32:23.40 --> 02:32:30.20 Everything just think two months ago you couldn't do any pull-ups at all zero
02:32:31.08 --> 02:32:37.64 Now you can do 10 all it took was a good plan and the discipline to execute that plan to do it
02:32:38.84 --> 02:32:44.52 That's what it takes and you can apply that to just about anything if you are willing to do the work
02:32:44.76 --> 02:32:46.76 You can make things happen
02:32:47.40 --> 02:32:50.76 And like I told you no one else is going to do the work for you
02:32:50.76 --> 02:32:56.20 Sure you might get some help along the way but you might not who knows what we do know is this
02:32:56.76 --> 02:33:03.64 Hard work and discipline are how you achieve things you have to make things happen and that is exactly what you did here
02:33:04.12 --> 02:33:06.92 And you can do that with almost anything in life
02:33:08.28 --> 02:33:10.28 Remember that
02:33:12.12 --> 02:33:18.68 Uncle Jake's put now some word to young Mark so there's all kinds of good lessons for you know
02:33:18.68 --> 02:33:21.88 I'd love to say to kids book it's a kids book basically. I'm gonna tell you what

02:38:33.24 --> 02:38:38.68 Straight up golden because everyone comes like hey, I had this scenario that's been basically plaguing me
02:38:38.68 --> 02:38:44.36 For a year and it's just causing problems here and you know and everyone has their own one and while they're all unique
02:38:44.36 --> 02:38:48.60 They all kind of overlap with each other and and you guys are like okay, this way you do this way
02:38:48.60 --> 02:38:50.36 You do this is the answer and it's like dang
02:38:50.52 --> 02:38:56.92 We now we have an answer we go back to the work in it like a lot of times it'll just solve like this one problem that affects all this other stuff
02:38:57.32 --> 02:39:01.32 Man, it's so effective it is and when people
02:39:02.04 --> 02:39:05.08 Come and they hear those questions get asked and and again
02:39:05.08 --> 02:39:10.12 There's always an overlap on the questions right and and there's overlap on the principles as well
02:39:10.44 --> 02:39:11.48 You know
02:39:11.48 --> 02:39:15.80 Cover and move simple prioritize next girl execute decentralized command those
02:39:16.76 --> 02:39:19.000 The explanations can stand alone on themselves
02:39:19.16 --> 02:39:24.60 But you start getting into real-world application there's gonna be other there they're gonna overlap
02:39:24.60 --> 02:39:28.68 You can you need all four of them right you need all four of them to solve your problem
02:39:28.68 --> 02:39:32.68 You can't just solve a problem with decentralized command because if you try and do that
02:39:32.68 --> 02:39:35.64 You'll make something too complex you gotta keep it simple and by the way
02:39:35.64 --> 02:39:39.08 There's gonna be multiple problems that you're gonna be trying to solve with your decentralized command
02:39:39.08 --> 02:39:41.64 So you gotta prioritize next week. So that's the way it is for every
02:39:42.20 --> 02:39:45.08 Every problem that you're you're suffering and then there's you know
02:39:45.08 --> 02:39:46.44 There's obviously other
02:39:46.44 --> 02:39:50.84 Other principles that we build upon that aren't just the four laws of combat
02:39:51.40 --> 02:39:58.20 So you gotta get you gotta that's what's good is when people hear the way that you utilize these tools
02:39:58.20 --> 02:40:03.16 They learn to utilize them themselves right that's that's what you're trying to do
02:40:03.16 --> 02:40:08.28 It's like trying to teach someone to take pictures right you don't just you and I'm saying this because you know
02:40:08.28 --> 02:40:09.64 I've been talking about cameras
02:40:09.88 --> 02:40:15.16 You don't just say okay here point this and point this set the setting to this set the light over here
02:40:15.24 --> 02:40:19.000 Set this up presses button and there's your picture that's cool. It works that one time
02:40:19.80 --> 02:40:23.24 What what happens when I step outside? Yeah, there's different lighting what happens when the subject is moving
02:40:23.24 --> 02:40:29.24 You gotta teach me how to do the job you gotta teach me the intricacies intricacies of it
02:40:29.40 --> 02:40:34.28 You gotta show me all those things. I gotta learn how to use that tool and that's what we do at the
02:40:34.28 --> 02:40:39.24 Master you get these various tools you don't just read about them and see what they are and say
02:40:39.24 --> 02:40:43.72 Okay, I understand what this tool is here. I'm holding this tool in my hand. It's sharp. I can cut with it
02:40:43.72 --> 02:40:48.12 Well, guess what else you can do with this? There's a lot of things you can do with these tools that we put out at the
02:40:48.12 --> 02:40:53.64 Master we take it to the next level. So if that's what you're looking for come to the master come to the master
02:40:53.64 --> 02:40:55.64 We got great feedback across the board
02:40:55.80 --> 02:41:06.20 So yeah, come and get that in the meantime also if there's something that you want to ask or you have a question or you want to give some feedback or comment about what we're doing here

02:41:42.36 --> 02:41:53.32 First of all to all the people in uniform that are out there holding the line against terror against extremism against criminals against fire and disaster against
02:41:53.32 --> 02:41:56.04 accidents and against the unexpected

02:42:00.04 --> 02:42:05.000 Thank you for keeping us safe and everyone else out there. Thank you for listening

02:42:13.96 --> 02:42:17.80 You be thankful for your freedom
02:42:20.52 --> 02:42:23.32 Your precious and
02:42:23.80 --> 02:42:25.80 costly freedom
02:42:25.80 --> 02:42:32.60 Because sometimes when something is given to us just given to us
02:42:35.40 --> 02:42:39.96 We forget what the cost was we forget the price that was paid
02:42:41.72 --> 02:42:43.72 And there was a
02:42:44.12 --> 02:42:47.96 price paid for our freedom a massive price
02:42:47.96 --> 02:42:57.64 There are those that paid everything they had for our freedom
02:43:00.60 --> 02:43:06.04 So don't waste it don't abuse it don't scondrate
02:43:10.36 --> 02:43:15.96 Our time here is limited your time here is limited
02:43:15.96 --> 02:43:17.96 And
02:43:17.96 --> 02:43:25.40 You have this freedom you have this gift so what are you going to do with it?
02:43:28.68 --> 02:43:31.72 What are you going to do with it today right now?
02:43:36.36 --> 02:43:39.72 Ask yourself that question ask
02:43:39.72 --> 02:43:43.72 And then go out
02:43:46.68 --> 02:43:48.68 And get after it
02:43:48.68 --> 02:44:10.68 So until next time this is echo and juggle out
