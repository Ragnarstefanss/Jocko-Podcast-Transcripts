And you know, whatever those things are, I know they're going to have something to do with how to think, how to manage emotions, how to adapt like a lot of the real basic things that are going to in one way or another, apply to everything. So if someone, you know, if it's like you said if it's a minor thing, don't go jumped on his throat or just jumped to this thing, really just be like, okay, you know, deal with it in your way, but like I said, log in in your brain and move forward. You know, so like, you know, it's certain things people, let's say, quote, I'm quote, normal people might find like exercise, for example. So I don't, you know, I, you know what I regret now is like, I want to still be in, you know? You know, when someone's like all standing up and all upright and reaching for your collar while you're standing, you know, they got some judo going on. They'll ask you a question that if you say no to you look dumb or something like that, you know, so it's, I don't know if they're going to say yes 15 times a row. And then, you know, like anything, all these offsuits that grow, you know, they, you know, there's some overlap for sure. I mean, I said it when I was talking, you know, people say, oh, of course honesty is, you know, the best thing you got to be honest. so, I was like, this guy, it's like so disingenuous, you know, like he wanted the credit. yeah, I think, like, you know, a lot of companies they discourage, fraturizing with, you know, your co-workers. Like a mix of, like he doesn't, I don't want to look up to him, but there's a sense of that right where if your leader is just going to spend, you have that kind of ingrained respect, and then not to mention on top of that, you don't fear any real consequences from him. You know, I think it was you know like 1996 we started seeing the Uma plot and we were oh man. I just thought of this like, if a guy got in trouble for whatever reason when we were over on deployment, whenever I was on deployment and combat, if a guy got in trouble, you know what their punishment would be? And then they they'll kind of double down on it and say, hey, you know, I speak the truth, you know, and like me for who I am or whatever. And you realize like, oh, when I'm on the bottom in the half guard, where I feel super comfortable when I'm doing Jiu Jitsu, if I'm in a real fight, I'm going to be getting headbutted or I'm going to be getting punched in the face. Like if so, if let's say you're just an average person who's like, man, I got to, I'm going to make a new just resolution. And he kind of had this look on his face looking at us as if he needed us to be like, wow, that was so great, but you know, when the look is so transparent, he's like, Like, super happy about knowing that you could choke people, and he would get into fights in the civilian world, and come and give me these full de-briefs and ask me for pointers and judgment, and that was, you know, a warrior that liked to fight, and he found out that you could grab people and submit them. You know, the guy was like, hey, I'm just going to stand till it till. You know, the Germans did not know they were suspect where we were going to attack They be like, you know what, hey, hey, whatever their message is, and they'd be like, hey, take this free gift. You would have been better off slowly trying to take the plan that he came up with and maybe maneuver on it or maybe say, hey, boss, I don't know if that's going to work because of this thing over here, but you'd be tactful. Oh, you're going against, you're going full speed, you know, toe to toe. Of course I'm not going to, you know, hate on the question or nothing like that. And so here is like a cage to animal, that if you don't, if you just know who the boss is, and he doesn't respect the boss, he's not going to listen to you. If you multiply whatever ten players per side that are actually banging heads, times however many plays, you know, you're talking about thousand, you know, probably more than a thousand head on head contacts in a football game. So you don't want to let the enemy know where you're going to attack him because then he can defend that specific area. So, you know, like, kind of like, what is it? You know, even if you're 20% addicted, you're like, okay, I like on buddy still addicted. And I always say that that's kind of the risk you run with teaching people Gjitsu, because it is like, I'm going to, it's a superpower, essentially, because you don't have to learn that much for it to be effective in this huge way. Hence the saying, if you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. You know, I think a lot of people are like that. That is not a good plan to say, hey, I'm going to get so good at striking that I'm going to stop a grappler.
