And it's awesome and the cool thing is like these the first ones use the pilot program that people are gonna be able to you know Be a part of it's like being a part of like muster zero zero one like those are plank owners and people are gonna be Plank owners of the individual FTX's You know we were talking last night, you know You're dinner table about the two different tiers that we know that we're gonna definitely do one like I said It's just the the two full days of training and it's just gonna be Run after run after run after run after run I mean you can be you're gonna have so many runs like somebody's gonna say Hey, I'm gonna have to sit this one out and somebody's listening. I can like jump and like slide out like I need to be able to get out like Whoever like they've got they've got me pinned down like they've got their bead well done Take mark on your side for now like like I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna get out of this situation and then I hear A very familiar sound that usually brings a lot of comfort To me and it was Mikey and one of the other machine gunners just Bupupupupupupupupupupupup like they're seeing it off each other and then you hear all the other guy shooting So there's a gunfight going on however that gunfight's not in front of the courtyard they were Down the alleyway they had left me like I Insultly realized that I'd been left behind on that target and I knew that I had to get out of the room But and it was clear But what was not clear to me was when you're actually in that situation because there is some gray zones there There is some like you know like once you're in a situation it kind of changes like How you can interpret something and I know and our leadership had always made it very clear and I knew just knew that if If you shoot somebody That was not in any combat and fighter that was not within the rules of engagement You're gonna be going to jail All right like I'm gonna be going to Levinworth to make big rocks to medium rocks to make medium rocks to small rocks Like that's not gonna be good like you can't just shoot people without them having a weapon or doing a hostile act or something That's within your rules of engagement and so we were setting up an Overwatch and I was lead sniper and I'm scanning my area It's like it's the worst because like what if what if like they didn't say anything They just like okay jpe's back, but then you kind of sense just a little bit of you know Like they're a little bit short with you or something like that it's like that's like an added double triple torture right there and then you told me like and then life comes up and he has his big smile He's like you good to go like yes, sir Then you guys are laughing you're like we were Jocco was joking about how we should just let you sleep until you woke up and just to see like what you would do Remember just the thought of that was like I don't know what I if I would have just kept sleeping and then woken up at like Whenever I don't know three o'clock in the afternoon for the closing of the buster I probably would have just gone straight to the airport right here's my two week notice It's been real thanks guys. and I just remember it's like thinking like man I really need to make this work with echelon front like I really need to make sure I'm doing what I need to do and not just like Make it work like hey, I'm available for work like do you have opportunity like let me know what I need A lot of my marriage to fall apart, but It's still always been there that's kept you know, just me reminded like hey Your your individual actions matter and that's one of the things I've always tried to Remind myself of the opportunity that I've had with with you and life here at echelon front is I need Every one of my Actions needs to impact the team for the greater good and you know, I'm and I would always have this little joke like hey everything's a test Like everything is a test with joccal life like hey, you don't know like I choose to remember that smile How he would come up and he would just like he would always like and it's like slap me on the back and kind of grab my trap and just like Just a little shake and you're just like you such a strong powerful guy when you do that you're like Okay, you know, but You know I mean people are solving problems for each other people ask a question and there's 20 responses and so that's what that next tier is gonna be like is where they're gonna come in We're gonna have that you know how the group dinner morning PT's day of runs dinner morning PT Day of runs and then like a kind of like a final like recapping everything of Of of of round table and that might be that might be a three three and a half day type of Situation but for the individual program, you know people go to echelon front.com And I am so mad at myself Like I am so upset with myself and disappointed and I said well you just screwed up the best thing you ever had Because I'm like this joc was gonna fire me I didn't know like you know like because I also understand there is no Slack with what we do it's been made very clear like hey, we don't miss events We don't drink on the road with clients. and I know you you said it was like is there anything like The VA like you were like concerned because you knew like I was having some issues with with my brain and Just my ability to focus and headaches and and sleeping and and stuff like that He's just more reserved on it and I I had kind of talked about like what about like You know different like signature flavor like you know kind of like one for me or other people would you guys be open to it? and I think he could have come in and be like Hey, this is what we're gonna be doing like hey, I had a talk with Dr. alcohol life and I would have been like Roger that sir Like the check like I know my place. and I would I would make it to where like Even like if I didn't I I wanted to be able to do it to where I if I couldn't see the advanced slide like I would practice different ways Where the computer was behind me like representing the screen and I would I would I would do that and I would get into my little rhythm of like Hey, as you can see to make sure I was still on the right slide Practice using reflections off of like pictures or mirrors and stuff to see where I was at on stuff behind me Just try to put myself in bad situations so that I could go through it We're in no choice but there's that little gray area where it's like man to optimize like Just ask for a little bit of help and you might be able to optimize not to say that's always gonna be a situation But then exactly what you said you kind of got to wrestle with Someone like you would you wouldn't be like you would take it as a personal failure like I shouldn't I shouldn't and this is a good thing by the way I shouldn't have to ask for any help ever unless I'm about to drown otherwise it's not their problem. So I was kind of like talking through and I was like hey, I'm a small business Like this is like part of my business and like it's like oh wave at this time. Yeah That makes sense to me like how you especially with your personality But even like without necessarily your specific personality like you don't want to like as a team member enthusiastic new team member and you have that like kind of attitude or whatever like non That's how I'd fit in on the team and set of focusing on being The best version of who I am being who God created like God created me a certain way I have a certain personality You know, I am I am made the way I am made for a reason Just like you're made the way you are for a reason you've been made able to Figure out exactly what makes you the most effective and you capitalize on that just like life has just like Dave has just like all the other members of the Eshelon front team are have or they're learning to do right and so at that point I had there's there's plenty of options for me to go out I'm saying you didn't act you weren't actually drowning no, you know, but what I'm saying is if if there's someone listening right now That's like drowning then you ask then you have to ask for help and you know what man I have had friends mutual friends of ours people that we know People that you don't know that I mean, you know whatever I've had plenty of friends that have come to me and been like hey man This is what's going on hey maybe you know Just the event something happened with the event like hey, maybe they had a part of that just to see how you would do Obviously we know that's not the fact, but it was just just to allow us and allow myself to not You know fall to complacency You know, I've talked about this in the mustard and we've all taught you know complacency gets people killed And complacency is something that we have to actually go to war with every single day because it creeps in you that Alarm clock goes off the complacency is gonna creep in it is gonna creep in in your professional life Your personal life your relationship with your wife or your husband your significant other You know we had no kitchen because that I mean we had a kitchen we had no dining room area because that's where the office was We would eat in the living room on TV trays like you know that was where we'd have our family dinner Like we didn't actually sit at a table and less we went over to our in-laws and so I would be practicing my keynote 46 hours a day Legitimately like going through it listening to lace Keynote clicking along like making it my own kind of doing some tweaks talking with you in life here and and So I was you know doing what I could and I met this I met these brothers at a shooting course that I did and they're like hey if you ever do like your own like we love to do is like in it like Just some Specific specialized training with you Okay, you know, I thought I was pretty aggressive, but hey all right, but you explain like I need you Like it's just getting stuff done like I need you to you know help set that I need you to help you know just this task unit And so we kind of told him like hey, this is what we need and they're like what we can't do anything like we start at seven And the guy in the guy said okay, we we've Rented out this many rooms for this many days like this needs to happen and the front desk lady was like and And I'm like trying to figure out like I need to get out of the room like I'm trying to time it I'm like well if I maybe if I get on my stomach I can get it like a sprinter's position. It'll be three days You know it'll be With with that group of 30 30 or less and you know, it'll be one day of You know there'll be like round table discussions getting to know the unique differences of the different businesses that Talking through the different problems that people are going through and actually diving deep into their principles and and addressing it with a group and having All the different individuals that are there actually contributing to Like the leadership principles that we talk about and solve because as you see from EF online I mean you look at the chat. You're like you good like yes, they're I was like I'm I don't what happened I was like I'm he's like a good just make sure good. No, it wasn't because there there's gray areas And even the idea of like hey if you shoot the wrong person you're going to prison like that's actually not true and You know civilians We'll get killed in combat unintentionally and if you if mistakes like that are gonna happen and that doesn't mean your chain of command is gonna hang you out to dry You're gonna get sent to prison. He would let me set up shooting courses and hunting hunting rifles down at his family's farm for nothing Because I was like hey man, I was like we could split the cost I can pay you guys it's like man my dad just likes having you around down here I'm like okay, you know, he's that So I'm like man, this is amazing so we shoot a little bit more well he doesn't tell the guy Like my background like in the guy was like the suit first time shooting this guy on my guy You just you know It's an awesome facility that they have done there things didn't work out between us because of my lack of Proper communication with him You know, I I dropped the ball on that and so then I was solely doing my own thing I was teaching shooting I was citing in people's hunting rifles for I was just doing anything I could for extra money like doing construction Repairing fences in the neighborhood for the landlord to help like go towards my rent and you know, and then I got the call to From a team guy buddy of ours Kevin Cap and he was like hey, what are you doing the summer? yes and I told him like hey anything that I can join Jock on life like I'm available just if you can just give me more than like a next day travel heads up like we're good to go You know, she was she's been so amazing from the get go and so helpful We can't just take kids back to the United States with us to provide safety and security But you know, it's just something that's all I've always kind of thought about is my worst day is somebody's dream Like the things that we can complain about People would love to have those Those problems and so that was just another reminder that I have to myself and like hey like your life's not bad Man you live in America You know, you have a house. but and you know how like Especially if Like the ideally you want to be the team player that's like the easiest to work with and then of course The one that executes and does a good job for sure, but what if like what if your team member that you executed well? and I remember I felt really comfortable up there Like I wasn't nervous like when I was sitting in the hotel room with you like just trying to go through the slides I was you know, it was horrible I wish we would have like video footage of some of that because that would be a awesome You know not like Mike's really where I like like Actual GIG rambo hero right the 11 combat deployments Is where you would have a family Try to give their kids to you like they're asking you to take that did that never happened to me. What about this in this and if I can tie this answer into it I think it's important for people to hear and understand it's like you want to be that person on the team toward if your company has to start cutting back Every time they see your name on the list they're like nope and needs to be bumped up a little bit nope and needs to be bumped up a little bit And that's just kind of like the mindset I've always tried to have of just being that Contributing member of a team and and not him not me At the end of the day also this is nothing for me to complain about because I also know That my worst day is somebody's dream and I was like I just want you to know like I'm all in like anything I can do Like I can't keep doing what I'm doing right now. Even that seeing all the guys and You know I I was standing watch over Seth at the funeral home and Guys had different you know different watchers stand over and the command was That all these guys that were from Seal team through that were Rogered up to to stand watch over him and myself and a bunch of the other guys We're like no we're gonna stand watch over Seth that's like that's is what we need to be doing And the command was awesome these new guys are super fired up and square it away And very professional and they understand who Seth was and the impact that he had and and we're watching over the guys and I'm Where I was at the funeral home and Standing there and my uniform and the family members are coming in I'm wearing a suit and It just it was just I felt like I was making some progress from my situation Even though like financially there had been no difference like I was starting to see the change in my mind in my mindset like my attitude The way I was thinking of things and I remember this guy asked her question you said hey, what's the best? I was like lacking and you know That's what I was missing out on again and just to have that, but it's all driven from Amanda and my family and You know when the drink came out You know Amanda you know we got it and choose like I was this awesome I said hey Let your wife know The flavor isn't gonna make sense throughout the beginning because she's so used to like all this other sugar and junk and everything I was like that because that's a lot of people say like well the flavor is a little different I'm like okay not not a threat And the other thing like man, I don't want to do this at the airport because then I'm never gonna be able to fly I can't if I have to defend myself in the airport It's probably gonna be bad the guy has big old smile and he's like hey, are you? I truly believe that Because it takes away from that sense of entitlement and people think that because they're all a part of a team That they get to reap the rewards and it's like no like if you are putting out if you are working If you're hunting then you're going to eat and I knew that and you told me you and life both told me hey We are going to give you as much work as you want if it's there You are the one that needs to tell us like hey, I need a need a break And so we start that and tour and this is I'm still like I'm doing my brief like every day I am rehearsing my echelon front keynote Legitimately at this time 46 hours a day like Amanda like I'd be in my office I'd be in I would pick different locations in our house in a Mississippi when we got back together and I remember that was like kind of the first time I had kind of it was was vulnerable with you and shared with you like I can't keep doing what I'm doing like if I could do something with you like this is what I want to do He's a cam not gonna be able to pay you your travel day You know because I don't have to pay for another instructor like I don't care man like the fact that you're cool with me leaving halfway through this course Do thank you so much like this this means a lot to me I'm a guest book it right like it was just It was unique as unique situation that we're in You know we had the we had mustard zero zero three down an awesome Texas and that was It was awesome like that was a great mustard learned a lot and you know I Learned about my limitations and I remember I was just going going going going going going going because I had all the other stuff I was still doing and then and it wasn't until June that I would stop doing all the other things I go up there and It was just this wreck like I recognized Like where I was still a lot because I was still on this like I'm JP to know with echelon front I was just in a nice suit and Kiwis Florida giving a leadership speech, you know I gave this workshop And then it like I was able to put it together God done Give the keynote Went and had lunch with the buddy The company requested like hey if you can hang out we'd like to have like cab dinner I You know I remember life like making sure I understood that he's like you can be out of my camera Go with that like I came from sales in a financial industry where that's what we did we actually helped People get paid before they got paid He sent me a text that was like JPE needs help Can you take care of him and I just wrote back Roger Awesome and you know you and I like I said and as I went through our text and You know, I don't know oh Check okay, like I'll make sure that I don't say that There's all the things that you know he's been great on coaching me on like hey like try to make sure you're not saying this and doing this this way And she said y'all how my parents come over and her parents come over and I just remember I was like Like I got the kids ready I Was like I was a coward I sat in the kitchen as a graphic kids I didn't even meet them at the door Because I didn't know what to do And I always be like over there over there over there like kind of like just kind of like And I use my credit card to Jimmy open the door because there was like You know order like hotel and QS Florida like easy to break into everything there so use my credit card get in I'd go into the check out the room that I'm gonna be speaking in there's nothing set up at all like oh Black Friday specials like the camp overnight to like get the TV that they're saving 50 dollars on like people I felt like I was planning operations like we did in a Remoddy I felt like it was just I was having that sense of fulfillment again And that's what a lot of people struggle with and you and I have talked about this a lot and I know life and I have talked about this a lot Veterans and first responders and law enforcement officers and firefighters and EMS I've never been like that I don't like the people on social media that are like bragging about like I made this much money This is a percentage of it and you know like that's that's how it works like you do events like you get a percentage He goes obviously jocquanir gonna get paid much more than you are I laugh He's gonna crush this thing I go he just freaks out in front of me and he's like Roger that You see I said you know we'll do it the other thing that sucks about this whole thing is You know you were going through like again. and you're like hey, I want to talk to you about the way that we get paid It seems like we should maybe do and you had this whole like pitch to me about You know you could get advanced from the client Okay, like these are opportunities that were actually helping and then fulfilling Online t-shirt orders these were all things that were making ends meet that I'm Like I don't think If I would have come to you and said hey, I'm how and you're like hey don't worry about this I don't think that would have made the situation better I would eat as a kid the jolly ranchers Those those They're like karma like there's like sour green apple with a caramel like I'm like Damn it like this is awkward like I just didn't feel like I deserved that the We'll just do some mock Q&A and Like that was the feedback that I got for me guys Because I had I don't even know how many hours of this presentation I had worked through I mean There's a lay-flist thinking you did like three hours of practice, but you did three thousand Close to it, you know, I mean I mean hundreds of hours Legitimately of just planning and and just going through it and just making sure that I knew It's just crazy just to see it, you know, and I Know we're gonna close it out like he has no one would do, but you know I have to take a moment to thank Amanda and and Aiden and Korra and Nola Just for their dedication to me to just always have my back, you know Amanda's through thick it was like the you know the field training exercises when you and life came out and saw What what and progressed into and what we're doing out up and Michigan with our large client up there like for you and life Both to
