and that's really what it is It's more like a direct line like people who like like I care like if a new item comes out item Something new on the store comes out or something something super relevant like I'm not gonna be like Hey, by the way, let me just send you this that you won't read or I don't know like I won't just I don't use it to I don't think it should be used ever, but so I don't use it to try to like keep your attention on my website You know, it's not that I figure I looked at it kind of like I forget if I heard someone say this or not, but it was really made sense where you know when you sign up for an email list What did you mean by that you're kind of offended like are you like are you kind of digging at me or something like that you know like that kind of even though you know kind of they were right like that was a little passive aggressive little comment Kind of thing so everyone's on a while when I'd experience that not just say it happens all the time, but if it ever happened What I do to kind of combat the anger because bro I'm like I'm the kind of where like if there's like a so Every time I enter in my email for like do you want updates, you know, I like you've never in my email for those things Which is kind of part of the point because you know I'm sign signing up right now to mark getting marketed to so People in a sign up they say okay, I want to be marketed to I'm not gonna like abuse like I'm not gonna Instantly violate your choice now. Like you that's what you have to in my opinion you have to address it like and the other thing the other thing about this not because I may have the that being said like if someone wants roll with you If you're healthy human being man getting all that's what I was saying That's what I was saying and what when that I get it if you have a situation and this is one that I need to I always have to watch out for like if I haven't let's say I'm injured and Let's say I normally do 10 rounds nine rounds eight rounds like that's my normal training And when I'm injured I'll be like We're just cruising and then the next round will go And when we go I mean we go I guess maybe there's some great Asian at the high end of the spectrum and I will Recognize a difference between that like let's say for instance You say like I'll know I don't want to let Andy pass my guard today right like for referred like a legit reason like I think He's got some new offensive move that I see him been pulling off That's not only a lot of me I want to go on every mission so I'll take I'll carry that radio But that and everything you know you just volunteer for everything so that's That's one of the best ways that you can make a good impression is by volunteering for stuff and then Crushing it and eventually people look at you and they say how this guy doesn't care what we give him He's gonna crush this task and you know what people like work with him because he's worried about the team and this person seems like a Bloods get let's give him a little task. If there is no if there is an ideal hiding place hide if not Prepare to attack them as soon as they enter the room get anyone in the room with you on board and ready to swarm the attacker So those are some notes from where to start and again you can take training for those type of situations To a very high degree, but if you have no training you need to know what to do in those situations That's that's why I put that in there you know I'll read this one more little section because I get asked this all the time of this to be getting the section dealing with injuries and illness What are you You are going to get injured You are going to get sick regardless of how careful you are in your training how clean you eat and how healthy you live You are still human Injuries and illness will occur My theory for overcoming injuries and illness is simple Do what you can If you are sick or injured don't use that as an excuse to skip workouts or stay in bed all day do what you can hurt your knee Work your upper body Work the good leg hurt your shoulder time to work on one arm to pull ups and pushups Focus on your core and legs until your shoulder heals up Ten to night is from using the grip too much sound like it's time to focus on sprinting and jumping plyometrics Got a little cold flu Same thing Yeah, it seems like a good thing Pride in it that's what I was gonna exactly what I was saying it's like take pride in it's like embracing the role as like the captain kind of right it's it's so clear how you want to handle that number one you just want to take some ownership of what's going on Now there is also the chance that once they've come back or it or that you you help them out and they like Start looking at you and saying oh, you know Jocco's just gonna do all my work for me Jocco's just gonna you know I can just lean on him. and Now you're in a shootout with them People are getting you know, I mean you're probably gonna win if you train hard, but still in a sense might be you know bystanders You don't just don't know here you just know who people are yeah, that's a good lesson to learn from your juts human the intimidate No, but here's the thing here's the thing of course at the time it's a little bit frustrating and this is kind of part of the point where If they didn't want to roll because maybe whatever It was too big and they were like small or something like that then you can tell the guy hey Look respectfully like I don't want to roll with you I fear injury I fear whatever if you're marks on my face or whatever Yeah Good jockels start.com if you look a check-out check those things out If you like something Get something good way to support also psychological warfare if you don't know what that is we all know what that is should I even Manchin what it is real you should my is okay people don't know all right. I'm gonna I'm gonna actually step in and say oh Hey echo you know you got that that project working on and you know with that little time and you got Hey, I got to how I'm gonna stay at the office a little bit late tonight anyways And that's exactly why I made a packed with my own always roll with that You want to be yeah, because it is a it's a siege to roll with it and there's guys like that and you know Like you know, it's funny you know Yeah It feels like you're supposed to influence like living on or something like that No, but man so it's like It's like like hey guys Nothing like you could you knew what to expect this guy was so consistent with every every little thing All the way down to the point that like if you call him Tokita because sometimes that's how you know when you get real Chummy with it with the teachers just in general if you're that kind of person You won't say mr. or Mrs. You know you know gonna say go clean the sewer out They don't care they don't care They're volunteering for everything and you know what I got this when I got to the team That's what I did volunteered for every as a matter of fact I volunteered to be a radio man because I had heard that it was a really hard job that no one wanted It was like And he didn't get mad not like that he just answers a corral stoic this answers the question and as he's Shuffling his papers like this just real like this guy was so cold cold his ice guy Because like if pull me answers a question and it goes and that's mr. Tokita and they need just continues on right? but if you're like, you know If this is the fight and you know if you like all elements and let's say you're focusing on like a self-defense Situation and the guy's not engaging then
