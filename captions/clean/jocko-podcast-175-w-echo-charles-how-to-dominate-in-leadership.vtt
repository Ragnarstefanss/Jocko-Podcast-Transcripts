00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.34
This is Jockel Podcast number 175.

2
00:00:03.34 --> 00:00:06.24
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:06.24 --> 00:00:07.04
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:07.88
Good evening.

5
00:00:07.88 --> 00:00:14.12
23 October 1942, 8th Army.

6
00:00:14.12 --> 00:00:18.12
Personal message from the Army commander.

7
00:00:18.12 --> 00:00:23.98
When I assumed command of the 8th Army, I said that the mandate was to destroy

8
00:00:23.98 --> 00:00:30.86
the Army and his army and that it would be done as soon as we are ready.

9
00:00:30.86 --> 00:00:33.42
We are ready now.

10
00:00:33.42 --> 00:00:38.98
The battle which is about to begin will be one of the decisive battles of history.

11
00:00:38.98 --> 00:00:42.10
It will be the turning point of the war.

12
00:00:42.10 --> 00:00:48.22
The eyes of the whole world will be on us watching anxiously which way the battle will

13
00:00:48.22 --> 00:00:50.78
swing.

14
00:00:50.78 --> 00:00:54.42
We can give them their answer at once.

15
00:00:54.42 --> 00:00:58.10
It will swing our way.

16
00:00:58.10 --> 00:01:04.78
We have first class equipment, good tanks, good anti-tank guns, plenty of artillery and plenty

17
00:01:04.78 --> 00:01:06.38
of ammunition.

18
00:01:06.38 --> 00:01:12.66
We are backed up by the finest air striking force in the world.

19
00:01:12.66 --> 00:01:18.22
All that is necessary is that each one of us, every officer in man should enter this

20
00:01:18.22 --> 00:01:29.10
battle with the determination to see it through, to fight and to kill and finally to win.

21
00:01:29.10 --> 00:01:33.90
If we all do this, there can be only one result.

22
00:01:33.90 --> 00:01:40.22
Together we will hit the enemy for six right out of North Africa.

23
00:01:40.22 --> 00:01:44.46
The sooner we win this battle, which will be the turning point of the war, the sooner

24
00:01:44.46 --> 00:01:49.26
we shall all get back home to our families.

25
00:01:49.26 --> 00:01:56.22
Therefore let every officer and man enter the battle with a stout heart and the determination

26
00:01:56.22 --> 00:02:04.22
to do his duty as long as he has breath in his body and let no man surrender so long

27
00:02:04.22 --> 00:02:09.38
as he is unwounded and can fight.

28
00:02:09.38 --> 00:02:13.58
Let us all pray that the Lord might be in battle.

29
00:02:13.58 --> 00:02:17.22
We will give us victory.

30
00:02:17.22 --> 00:02:25.34
BL Montgomery, Lieutenant General, 8th Army.

31
00:02:25.34 --> 00:02:34.82
And that is a note written on the eve of the battle of Alameen, which ended up being the

32
00:02:34.82 --> 00:02:43.70
turning point of the war in North Africa and General Bernard Montgomery, commonly referred

33
00:02:43.70 --> 00:02:54.50
to as Monti, defeated the desert fox, Rama, one of the most respected generals in all

34
00:02:54.50 --> 00:02:56.34
of history really.

35
00:02:56.34 --> 00:02:59.34
And Monti was actually a controversial figure.

36
00:02:59.34 --> 00:03:07.30
And I think he got more controversial, the more famous he got.

37
00:03:07.30 --> 00:03:11.58
He was a soldier, he was gravely wounded by a sniper in the battle of the praises.

38
00:03:11.58 --> 00:03:18.46
He was shot in the lung, he was in such bad shape that they actually dug a grave for him.

39
00:03:18.46 --> 00:03:26.02
But somehow he pulled through, he recovered, he served the rest of the war as a staff officer.

40
00:03:26.02 --> 00:03:32.66
And he was actually very critical of the tactics and of the strategy and of the willingness

41
00:03:32.66 --> 00:03:40.82
of the leadership to accept such horrific and heinous levels of casualties.

42
00:03:40.82 --> 00:03:42.58
So he was critical of that.

43
00:03:42.58 --> 00:03:47.22
And after the war was over, he served, he stayed in the army, he served in Palestine,

44
00:03:47.22 --> 00:03:50.54
he served in India.

45
00:03:50.54 --> 00:03:57.30
And then in 1939, of course there was more war.

46
00:03:57.30 --> 00:03:58.86
And he was in command of the third division.

47
00:03:58.86 --> 00:04:01.10
He went to France.

48
00:04:01.10 --> 00:04:03.58
And he was actually pretty worried about going to France.

49
00:04:03.58 --> 00:04:05.42
He didn't feel super confident about it.

50
00:04:05.42 --> 00:04:11.94
And he returned home with the rest of the British forces that were driven off the continent

51
00:04:11.94 --> 00:04:14.54
from Dunkirk.

52
00:04:14.54 --> 00:04:19.42
And you know there, they were able to refit to be able to go out and re-engage.

53
00:04:19.42 --> 00:04:22.26
And he headed to Africa next.

54
00:04:22.26 --> 00:04:27.30
And the eight army was pretty beat down at that point when he showed up, though he turned

55
00:04:27.30 --> 00:04:31.14
around their morale and made them believe that they could win.

56
00:04:31.14 --> 00:04:41.62
And the first major land victory of the war in the second battle of L. Alameen.

57
00:04:41.62 --> 00:04:46.38
From there, he helped the invasion of Sicily.

58
00:04:46.38 --> 00:04:52.06
And then he commanded all forces, all ground forces.

59
00:04:52.06 --> 00:04:55.02
On D.D.A. he commanded all the ground forces.

60
00:04:55.02 --> 00:04:57.66
So that was obviously a massive operation.

61
00:04:57.66 --> 00:05:03.14
He planned and led operation, market garden, which was the invasion of the low countries.

62
00:05:03.14 --> 00:05:07.54
We've covered some of those battles on this podcast because it was not good.

63
00:05:07.54 --> 00:05:09.58
It didn't go well.

64
00:05:09.58 --> 00:05:11.26
And he was kind of the guy pushing that.

65
00:05:11.26 --> 00:05:15.86
But he was able to redeem himself from that during the battle of the bulge, which we've

66
00:05:15.86 --> 00:05:19.10
also covered on this podcast.

67
00:05:19.10 --> 00:05:23.38
So you know he had some ups and downs, but mostly ups.

68
00:05:23.38 --> 00:05:25.66
So what was the controversial year?

69
00:05:25.66 --> 00:05:28.66
What's this kind of tainted image of him?

70
00:05:28.66 --> 00:05:32.66
First of all, some people saw him as being arrogant.

71
00:05:32.66 --> 00:05:36.30
And some of the people that saw him as being arrogant were Americans.

72
00:05:36.30 --> 00:05:39.14
Americans like Patton and Bradley.

73
00:05:39.14 --> 00:05:42.14
And I mean, let's face it if you're talking about for sure Patton.

74
00:05:42.14 --> 00:05:44.66
We're not talking about a guy with a small ego.

75
00:05:44.66 --> 00:05:49.34
So you can imagine that when you have a clash of egos, that can be, you know, you can

76
00:05:49.34 --> 00:05:52.82
get some professional jealousy and whatnot.

77
00:05:52.82 --> 00:05:59.30
Even Sir Winston Churchill said that Monti was, and this is a good quote, indifit unbeatable

78
00:05:59.30 --> 00:06:03.38
in victory unbearable.

79
00:06:03.38 --> 00:06:11.18
So there's another an anecdote about him where he was asked to name three great generals.

80
00:06:11.18 --> 00:06:15.94
He said the other two would be Alexander the Great and Napoleon meaning he's just a

81
00:06:15.94 --> 00:06:18.66
all top of the list.

82
00:06:18.66 --> 00:06:22.30
So he may have had, it may have been a little bit egotistical.

83
00:06:22.30 --> 00:06:29.78
And I think from what I've read about him, he lacked tact.

84
00:06:29.78 --> 00:06:34.46
And later on in life he was kind of controversial as well.

85
00:06:34.46 --> 00:06:40.70
He was very critical of American tactics in Vietnam.

86
00:06:40.70 --> 00:06:45.26
He said that America had no clear cut objective in Vietnam, which, you know, I'm critical

87
00:06:45.26 --> 00:06:46.26
of the tactics in Vietnam.

88
00:06:46.26 --> 00:06:50.74
I think it's pretty safe to say that there should have been a more clear cut objective.

89
00:06:50.74 --> 00:06:54.54
That but that obviously made some of our military leadership in America angry.

90
00:06:54.54 --> 00:06:58.82
I don't know if I would argue against those statements.

91
00:06:58.82 --> 00:07:05.82
He oddly enough spoke positively about the Chinese Communist government when he was older.

92
00:07:05.82 --> 00:07:09.66
He publicly supported apartheid in South Africa.

93
00:07:09.66 --> 00:07:16.22
So these are more things that people sort of sort of tainted his image.

94
00:07:16.22 --> 00:07:25.34
But besides all that he is still known as a as a as a tactician.

95
00:07:25.34 --> 00:07:30.78
And there's plenty of support from his troops and his men that that loved him and were

96
00:07:30.78 --> 00:07:31.78
ready to follow him anywhere.

97
00:07:31.78 --> 00:07:35.46
And there are some people that say even that he acted arrogant.

98
00:07:35.46 --> 00:07:40.42
It was almost like a show that he put on to kind of unify his troops that this was

99
00:07:40.42 --> 00:07:41.42
Montenegro.

100
00:07:41.42 --> 00:07:45.26
This was the great guy and we're just we got to look what Montenegro did.

101
00:07:45.26 --> 00:07:48.18
So there's that he wrote a lot.

102
00:07:48.18 --> 00:07:49.58
He spoke he wrote well.

103
00:07:49.58 --> 00:07:54.70
He's got some great some documents that he put out.

104
00:07:54.70 --> 00:07:57.10
And I won it one, he's got a ton of the people out.

105
00:07:57.10 --> 00:07:59.30
One of them, I'm going to read.

106
00:07:59.30 --> 00:08:03.22
It's a very interesting piece.

107
00:08:03.22 --> 00:08:11.18
He wrote this after Germany had surrendered and the British occupation forces were in place

108
00:08:11.18 --> 00:08:12.46
in Germany.

109
00:08:12.46 --> 00:08:15.98
So you've got the Brits there in Germany occupying the country.

110
00:08:15.98 --> 00:08:20.90
You've got the German civilians who have been defeated in war.

111
00:08:20.90 --> 00:08:28.78
And here we go to this message, the U.S. 10 June 1945, Germany, personal message from the commander

112
00:08:28.78 --> 00:08:34.58
and chief to the population of the British area in Germany.

113
00:08:34.58 --> 00:08:39.82
You have wondered no doubt why our soldiers do not smile when you wave your hands or say

114
00:08:39.82 --> 00:08:43.90
good morning in the streets or play with the children.

115
00:08:43.90 --> 00:08:48.38
It is because our soldiers are obeying orders.

116
00:08:48.38 --> 00:08:52.78
You do not like it nor do our soldiers.

117
00:08:52.78 --> 00:08:57.14
We are naturally friendly and forgiving people.

118
00:08:57.14 --> 00:09:02.38
But the orders were necessary and I will tell you why.

119
00:09:02.38 --> 00:09:08.58
In the last war of 1914, which your rulers began, your army was defeated.

120
00:09:08.58 --> 00:09:14.82
Your generals surrendered and the peace treaty of Versailles, your rulers admitted that the

121
00:09:14.82 --> 00:09:20.02
guilt of beginning the war was Germany's.

122
00:09:20.02 --> 00:09:23.18
But the surrender was made in France.

123
00:09:23.18 --> 00:09:25.58
The war never came to your country.

124
00:09:25.58 --> 00:09:31.54
Your cities were not damaged like the cities of France and Belgium and your armies

125
00:09:31.54 --> 00:09:35.58
marched home in good order.

126
00:09:35.58 --> 00:09:41.34
Then your rulers began to spread the story that your armies were never really defeated.

127
00:09:41.34 --> 00:09:47.06
And later they denied the war guilt clauses of the peace treaty.

128
00:09:47.06 --> 00:09:51.66
They told you that Germany was neither guilty nor defeated.

129
00:09:51.66 --> 00:09:57.26
Because the war had not come to your country, many of you believed it.

130
00:09:57.26 --> 00:10:02.02
And you cheered when your rulers began another war.

131
00:10:02.02 --> 00:10:09.98
Again after years of waste and slaughter and misery, your armies have been defeated.

132
00:10:09.98 --> 00:10:15.18
This time the allies were determined that you should learn your lesson not only that you

133
00:10:15.18 --> 00:10:21.54
have been defeated, which you must know by now, but that you, your nation, were again

134
00:10:21.54 --> 00:10:26.10
guilty of beginning the war.

135
00:10:26.10 --> 00:10:30.70
For if that is not made clear to you and your children, you may again allow yourselves

136
00:10:30.70 --> 00:10:37.34
to be deceived by your rulers and led into another war.

137
00:10:37.34 --> 00:10:43.70
During the war, your rulers would not let you know what the world was thinking of you.

138
00:10:43.70 --> 00:10:46.86
Many of you seem to think that when our soldiers arrived, you could be friends with them

139
00:10:46.86 --> 00:10:51.14
at once as if nothing much had happened.

140
00:10:51.14 --> 00:10:53.98
But too much has happened for that.

141
00:10:53.98 --> 00:10:59.50
Our soldiers have seen their comrades shot down, their homes and ruins, their wives and children

142
00:10:59.50 --> 00:11:01.78
hungry.

143
00:11:01.78 --> 00:11:07.86
They have seen terrible things in many countries where your rulers took the war.

144
00:11:07.86 --> 00:11:11.06
For those things, you will say you are not responsible.

145
00:11:11.06 --> 00:11:13.94
It was your rulers.

146
00:11:13.94 --> 00:11:17.34
But they were done by the German nation.

147
00:11:17.34 --> 00:11:22.30
The nation is responsible for its rulers and while they were successful, you cheered

148
00:11:22.30 --> 00:11:25.70
and laughed.

149
00:11:25.70 --> 00:11:29.58
That is why our soldiers do not smile at you.

150
00:11:29.58 --> 00:11:31.98
This we have ordered.

151
00:11:31.98 --> 00:11:37.70
This we have done to save yourselves, to save your children, to save the world from another

152
00:11:37.70 --> 00:11:39.70
war.

153
00:11:39.70 --> 00:11:42.86
It will not always be so.

154
00:11:42.86 --> 00:11:48.38
We are Christian for giving people and we like to smile and be friendly.

155
00:11:48.38 --> 00:11:53.46
Our object is to destroy the evil of the Nazi system.

156
00:11:53.46 --> 00:11:59.06
It is too soon to be sure that this has been done.

157
00:11:59.06 --> 00:12:04.26
You are to read this to your children if they are old enough and see that they understand.

158
00:12:04.26 --> 00:12:10.38
Tell them why it is that the British soldier does not smile.

159
00:12:10.38 --> 00:12:17.38
BL Montgomery Field Marshal Commander in Chief British Area.

160
00:12:17.38 --> 00:12:27.26
So, obviously that message was produced in German and in English and spread out amongst

161
00:12:27.26 --> 00:12:28.26
the population.

162
00:12:28.26 --> 00:12:32.70
I thought that was a pretty awesome outlook.

163
00:12:32.70 --> 00:12:40.54
He also spoke and wrote a fair amount about leadership.

164
00:12:40.54 --> 00:12:50.10
When you look at his writing and his speeches, you can see some of his peculiarities,

165
00:12:50.10 --> 00:12:55.30
some of his personality shines through sometimes.

166
00:12:55.30 --> 00:12:56.70
I want to take a look at some of that.

167
00:12:56.70 --> 00:13:05.26
Some of the things that he wrote and the first piece is called Military Leadership.

168
00:13:05.26 --> 00:13:12.50
It is actually from a speech that he gave at the University of St. Andrews in 15 November

169
00:13:12.50 --> 00:13:13.50
1945.

170
00:13:13.50 --> 00:13:15.90
It is like a transcript or maybe it is notes.

171
00:13:15.90 --> 00:13:17.98
I am not sure which.

172
00:13:17.98 --> 00:13:23.70
But it is written as if he was reading it.

173
00:13:23.70 --> 00:13:26.46
So here we go.

174
00:13:26.46 --> 00:13:29.22
Let's go to this book, Military Leadership.

175
00:13:29.22 --> 00:13:32.06
I have come here to talk to you about Military Leadership.

176
00:13:32.06 --> 00:13:38.38
A subject such as this must in normal times seem somewhat remote from this quiet gray

177
00:13:38.38 --> 00:13:42.50
walled city by the sea.

178
00:13:42.50 --> 00:13:46.70
Today I have to try and equate the definition of military leadership as I see it to the

179
00:13:46.70 --> 00:13:51.14
lessons of the past and to the experience of the present.

180
00:13:51.14 --> 00:13:56.38
I propose to limit myself in this talk to higher leadership, the command of armies or

181
00:13:56.38 --> 00:14:02.74
a group of armies and not to consider the quality of leadership at lower levels.

182
00:14:02.74 --> 00:14:07.86
What I say about higher leadership may well have certain application to leadership of a brigade

183
00:14:07.86 --> 00:14:10.98
or a company or a section of men.

184
00:14:10.98 --> 00:14:15.34
There are however certain differences in leadership at lower levels and I do not propose

185
00:14:15.34 --> 00:14:18.14
to take up your time by discussing these today.

186
00:14:18.14 --> 00:14:21.98
Now you will see as he goes into this he covers up he is talking about that all the time.

187
00:14:21.98 --> 00:14:24.86
I am not sure even why he did that.

188
00:14:24.86 --> 00:14:30.38
But he talks about the entire chain of command throughout this speech.

189
00:14:30.38 --> 00:14:33.78
Military Leadership is a subject which is always interested in me.

190
00:14:33.78 --> 00:14:37.94
During this war I have had some opportunity to put my ideas to the test.

191
00:14:37.94 --> 00:14:43.94
I have found that if you aspire to lead soldiers you must take a close study of human

192
00:14:43.94 --> 00:14:44.94
nature.

193
00:14:44.94 --> 00:14:50.38
For that is the raw material with which a commander has to achieve his end.

194
00:14:50.38 --> 00:14:55.50
If you neglect the human factor as a leader you will fail.

195
00:14:55.50 --> 00:15:00.86
The personal relationship between a commander and his soldiers is and always has been one

196
00:15:00.86 --> 00:15:06.06
of the most potent single factors in making for success and war.

197
00:15:06.06 --> 00:15:11.42
If a commander has the complete confidence and trust of his men there is nothing he cannot

198
00:15:11.42 --> 00:15:12.94
do.

199
00:15:12.94 --> 00:15:13.94
Nothing.

200
00:15:13.94 --> 00:15:21.58
If a commander loses the confidence of his men he cannot succeed.

201
00:15:21.58 --> 00:15:22.58
That is a bold statement.

202
00:15:22.58 --> 00:15:25.34
That is a bold statement.

203
00:15:25.34 --> 00:15:29.70
And something that I talk about all the time.

204
00:15:29.70 --> 00:15:33.54
And there are two words that I use interchangeably.

205
00:15:33.54 --> 00:15:37.18
I should use them more interchangeably more often.

206
00:15:37.18 --> 00:15:41.46
I talk about relationships a lot and the word that I should use in or mix with that 50%

207
00:15:41.46 --> 00:15:43.10
of time is trust.

208
00:15:43.10 --> 00:15:44.10
It is a true relationship.

209
00:15:44.10 --> 00:15:50.58
If you don't have trust you don't have a relationship then you don't have trust.

210
00:15:50.58 --> 00:15:53.58
But they do have different meanings.

211
00:15:53.58 --> 00:15:59.50
So it is important to me to establish that and the reason that I bring that up is because

212
00:15:59.50 --> 00:16:03.70
if you are in a leadership position and you are breaking the trust that you have with your

213
00:16:03.70 --> 00:16:07.10
men that is going to be a real problem.

214
00:16:07.10 --> 00:16:10.02
You can say you don't have a good relationship with them but you could not have a good

215
00:16:10.02 --> 00:16:12.78
relationship with someone and they could still trust you.

216
00:16:12.78 --> 00:16:17.74
You could not have a good relationship with someone and you hadn't broken their trust.

217
00:16:17.74 --> 00:16:23.02
It is going to be hard if you break their trust to have a good relationship with them.

218
00:16:23.02 --> 00:16:31.22
But the key factor here is trust and confidence of the men.

219
00:16:31.22 --> 00:16:32.22
Back to the book.

220
00:16:32.22 --> 00:16:36.66
Now let us consider on what a man's power to lead others is based.

221
00:16:36.66 --> 00:16:40.10
It is necessary first to define what is meant by leadership.

222
00:16:40.10 --> 00:16:42.62
And this is where this gets a little interesting.

223
00:16:42.62 --> 00:16:46.26
I suggest to you as the definition of the word leadership.

224
00:16:46.26 --> 00:16:52.46
The will to dominate together with the character which inspires confidence.

225
00:16:52.46 --> 00:16:56.54
The measure of a man's ability to lead, I think, is too fold.

226
00:16:56.54 --> 00:17:01.26
So the first part of the definition of leadership in his mind is the will to dominate.

227
00:17:01.26 --> 00:17:03.58
Which is, which is strong.

228
00:17:03.58 --> 00:17:09.38
And you are going to see where he kind of counters that and he talks about decentralized

229
00:17:09.38 --> 00:17:12.14
community talks about everything that I believe in.

230
00:17:12.14 --> 00:17:16.42
I don't talk about, hey, as a leader, it is first and foremost that you have the will to dominate

231
00:17:16.42 --> 00:17:17.42
other humans.

232
00:17:17.42 --> 00:17:21.18
That is not, in fact, I think that is a negative quality.

233
00:17:21.18 --> 00:17:31.90
But that being said, if you have someone that doesn't mind not winning, not dominating,

234
00:17:31.90 --> 00:17:34.62
well, they are not going to put forth any effort.

235
00:17:34.62 --> 00:17:38.34
They are not going to make things happen.

236
00:17:38.34 --> 00:17:42.38
Like, force of will, I talk about that all the time.

237
00:17:42.38 --> 00:17:44.78
You have to, you have to have the force of will to make things happen.

238
00:17:44.78 --> 00:17:46.98
Sometimes you just have to make things happen.

239
00:17:46.98 --> 00:17:49.58
They're not going to happen by themselves.

240
00:17:49.58 --> 00:17:52.02
Anything that's going to come, that's good in life.

241
00:17:52.02 --> 00:17:53.02
It's not going to happen by itself.

242
00:17:53.02 --> 00:17:55.58
It's not going to wake up and it's there.

243
00:17:55.58 --> 00:17:57.06
Like, like, an Easter egg.

244
00:17:57.06 --> 00:17:58.06
That's not happening.

245
00:17:58.06 --> 00:18:00.66
No, you got to go out and you got to make it happen.

246
00:18:00.66 --> 00:18:05.10
Okay, maybe you get an Easter egg when you're six years old.

247
00:18:05.10 --> 00:18:08.30
But once you're 26 years old, there's no Easter eggs coming to you.

248
00:18:08.30 --> 00:18:09.30
You got to make them.

249
00:18:09.30 --> 00:18:10.30
Okay.

250
00:18:10.30 --> 00:18:13.30
Back to the book.

251
00:18:13.30 --> 00:18:17.90
First it lies in his will to dominate the men and events which surround him.

252
00:18:17.90 --> 00:18:22.34
The will to drive himself and his men to the limit of their powers for a specific purpose

253
00:18:22.34 --> 00:18:26.74
and the refusal to allow anything to divert him from his aim.

254
00:18:26.74 --> 00:18:29.30
Again, you're going to see where that sounds so strong.

255
00:18:29.30 --> 00:18:30.78
It sounds unbalanced, right?

256
00:18:30.78 --> 00:18:33.14
It sounds like he's outside the dichotomy of leadership.

257
00:18:33.14 --> 00:18:34.14
He's going to follow one direction.

258
00:18:34.14 --> 00:18:35.14
He's being extreme.

259
00:18:35.14 --> 00:18:38.58
Like, nothing, you're going to refuse to allow anything to divert you.

260
00:18:38.58 --> 00:18:39.82
Okay, so that was that mean.

261
00:18:39.82 --> 00:18:41.62
Then you get everyone killed.

262
00:18:41.62 --> 00:18:42.82
That's what they did in World War I.

263
00:18:42.82 --> 00:18:44.46
He didn't like that.

264
00:18:44.46 --> 00:18:48.38
But you're going to see where he balances out these statements later.

265
00:18:48.38 --> 00:18:52.66
Second, it lies in the strength of his character, whether good or evil to inspire others

266
00:18:52.66 --> 00:18:58.34
to place their complete trust and confidence in him and his ability to lead them with success

267
00:18:58.34 --> 00:19:02.66
and to infuse his men for the task in hand.

268
00:19:02.66 --> 00:19:08.66
His ability of a man to inspire confidence in others and to create enthusiasm is a spiritual

269
00:19:08.66 --> 00:19:10.86
quality.

270
00:19:10.86 --> 00:19:16.02
But it is not, but it is well to remember that this quality need not necessarily be for

271
00:19:16.02 --> 00:19:17.02
good.

272
00:19:17.02 --> 00:19:23.04
The evil leader has equally the ability to inspire confidence in others and in history, the

273
00:19:23.04 --> 00:19:30.78
evil leader has often had any rate temporarily prevailed.

274
00:19:30.78 --> 00:19:33.06
And he counters that at the end too.

275
00:19:33.06 --> 00:19:39.06
There have been many with different types of characters, character who have inspired

276
00:19:39.06 --> 00:19:40.06
men to follow them.

277
00:19:40.06 --> 00:19:44.50
I propose to choose three great captains of the past and examine briefly why these

278
00:19:44.50 --> 00:19:49.02
men were leaders and how they led their men and how as leaders they succeeded or fails.

279
00:19:49.02 --> 00:19:54.38
So he's going to go into a little case study a couple pages here.

280
00:19:54.38 --> 00:19:57.50
I will first consider Moses.

281
00:19:57.50 --> 00:20:01.62
He was already old when he was called to lead the children of Israel out of the land of

282
00:20:01.62 --> 00:20:02.94
Egypt.

283
00:20:02.94 --> 00:20:04.46
His task was an immense one.

284
00:20:04.46 --> 00:20:09.34
He had first to inspire his people to cast off the yoke of the Egyptians.

285
00:20:09.34 --> 00:20:11.10
This was no easy matter.

286
00:20:11.10 --> 00:20:15.82
Israel had been living for about 400 years as slaves of the Egyptians.

287
00:20:15.82 --> 00:20:22.74
They had lived in the Nile Delta abad, climate and one which tends to sap up energy and

288
00:20:22.74 --> 00:20:29.42
initiative, but they lived where food was plentiest while all around were deserts which

289
00:20:29.42 --> 00:20:31.02
could barely support life.

290
00:20:31.02 --> 00:20:35.22
Moses must have had to overcome the most tremendous initial inertia to persuade Israel

291
00:20:35.22 --> 00:20:40.34
to launch out into those deserts with all the risks of famine, disease and the necessity

292
00:20:40.34 --> 00:20:41.34
to fight.

293
00:20:41.34 --> 00:20:47.46
His power to inspire and dominate his fellow men must have been of a very high order.

294
00:20:47.46 --> 00:20:52.06
Now see that's what I just, I don't look at that as domination of your fellow man.

295
00:20:52.06 --> 00:20:58.18
I look, I see the inspiring part, but I'm not looking at it, hey, we're looking to dominate.

296
00:20:58.18 --> 00:21:00.42
I see his angle, right?

297
00:21:00.42 --> 00:21:05.10
I see where he's coming from.

298
00:21:05.10 --> 00:21:09.58
And maybe that word, words change, words, morph over time.

299
00:21:09.58 --> 00:21:11.18
Maybe that word dominate that he's using.

300
00:21:11.18 --> 00:21:15.18
Maybe it had less of a sting to it.

301
00:21:15.18 --> 00:21:19.82
Then 50 years ago, possibly have less sting.

302
00:21:19.82 --> 00:21:22.02
70 years of words change.

303
00:21:22.02 --> 00:21:25.94
Yeah, words change over time.

304
00:21:25.94 --> 00:21:29.26
But that's what he's saying.

305
00:21:29.26 --> 00:21:31.22
But things were kind of hardcore too, right?

306
00:21:31.22 --> 00:21:34.90
Back then, you know, like long time ago, there are just things in general, we're a little

307
00:21:34.90 --> 00:21:35.90
bit more blunt.

308
00:21:35.90 --> 00:21:39.26
Yeah, so maybe the times that I'm not sure they were pretty good.

309
00:21:39.26 --> 00:21:40.86
And even this time, yeah, yeah.

310
00:21:40.86 --> 00:21:41.86
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:21:41.86 --> 00:21:42.86
I don't know, though.

312
00:21:42.86 --> 00:21:45.22
I'm not 100% sure.

313
00:21:45.22 --> 00:21:51.98
I'm not 100% sure if he means the word dominate the way we think of it.

314
00:21:51.98 --> 00:21:52.98
Apparently not.

315
00:21:52.98 --> 00:21:57.86
I mean, it seems like there's a little bit more to it.

316
00:21:57.86 --> 00:22:01.70
I guess when he count and you'll hear him count, I guess that's what maybe makes me think

317
00:22:01.70 --> 00:22:04.86
maybe he means it a little bit less severe.

318
00:22:04.86 --> 00:22:10.46
Maybe because he starts to talk about the balance of this dichotomy.

319
00:22:10.46 --> 00:22:11.46
Because let's face it.

320
00:22:11.46 --> 00:22:12.70
Hey, okay, let me ask you this question.

321
00:22:12.70 --> 00:22:14.94
Here out, this is Ms. gonna make it really easy.

322
00:22:14.94 --> 00:22:19.70
If I was a type of person that was like, hey, I'm looking to dominate you, come with me

323
00:22:19.70 --> 00:22:21.58
into the desert.

324
00:22:21.58 --> 00:22:23.46
And we're gonna have to live with us.

325
00:22:23.46 --> 00:22:24.78
We're going away from the Nile River.

326
00:22:24.78 --> 00:22:26.54
And we're going out to this barren area.

327
00:22:26.54 --> 00:22:27.66
We're just not a lot of food.

328
00:22:27.66 --> 00:22:29.34
And I'm gonna have a domineering personality.

329
00:22:29.34 --> 00:22:31.18
And I'm gonna be all over you every day.

330
00:22:31.18 --> 00:22:32.18
How enticing is that?

331
00:22:32.18 --> 00:22:33.18
Not very.

332
00:22:33.18 --> 00:22:34.18
Not very.

333
00:22:34.18 --> 00:22:36.78
Now, if I was inspiring, and I said, listen, echo, we're gonna get out there.

334
00:22:36.78 --> 00:22:37.78
We're gonna train.

335
00:22:37.78 --> 00:22:38.78
We're gonna come back.

336
00:22:38.78 --> 00:22:39.78
We're gonna get in our revenge.

337
00:22:39.78 --> 00:22:40.78
It's gonna take some time.

338
00:22:40.78 --> 00:22:41.78
But we're gonna make it.

339
00:22:41.78 --> 00:22:42.78
You're like that.

340
00:22:42.78 --> 00:22:43.78
That's different, right?

341
00:22:43.78 --> 00:22:44.78
Yeah.

342
00:22:44.78 --> 00:22:45.78
Yeah.

343
00:22:45.78 --> 00:22:46.78
Yeah.

344
00:22:46.78 --> 00:22:47.78
You know what?

345
00:22:47.78 --> 00:22:49.78
Now that I'm thinking of it, we're dominating.

346
00:22:49.78 --> 00:22:50.78
What's the root of the dominant?

347
00:22:50.78 --> 00:22:52.38
You know what it could be.

348
00:22:52.38 --> 00:22:54.98
Yeah, I should have studied the etymology before we got on this podcast.

349
00:22:54.98 --> 00:22:55.98
I apologize.

350
00:22:55.98 --> 00:22:57.98
You know what it could be though.

351
00:22:57.98 --> 00:23:00.82
Picture when you have a good leader that dominates the room.

352
00:23:00.82 --> 00:23:01.82
Right?

353
00:23:01.82 --> 00:23:02.82
Yeah.

354
00:23:02.82 --> 00:23:03.82
That's a positive thing.

355
00:23:03.82 --> 00:23:04.82
Right?

356
00:23:04.82 --> 00:23:05.98
Yeah, you know, echo came in for the meeting.

357
00:23:05.98 --> 00:23:07.14
He just dominated the room.

358
00:23:07.14 --> 00:23:08.14
He did great.

359
00:23:08.14 --> 00:23:09.14
That's a positive thing.

360
00:23:09.14 --> 00:23:10.14
Yeah.

361
00:23:10.14 --> 00:23:11.58
So maybe he means it that way.

362
00:23:11.58 --> 00:23:15.14
Unfortunately, he talks about dominating the will of.

363
00:23:15.14 --> 00:23:16.14
Right?

364
00:23:16.14 --> 00:23:20.74
He talks about dominating the men and events.

365
00:23:20.74 --> 00:23:21.74
That's around him.

366
00:23:21.74 --> 00:23:22.74
I don't know.

367
00:23:22.74 --> 00:23:24.26
Actually, he doesn't talk about dominating the will.

368
00:23:24.26 --> 00:23:25.26
So maybe that's what they mean.

369
00:23:25.26 --> 00:23:27.66
Maybe he means just like this dominating presence.

370
00:23:27.66 --> 00:23:28.66
Yeah.

371
00:23:28.66 --> 00:23:29.66
All right.

372
00:23:29.66 --> 00:23:35.54
Going back to the book without a doubt, Moses realized that when he led Israel out of Egypt,

373
00:23:35.54 --> 00:23:37.70
they were useless as a fighting people.

374
00:23:37.70 --> 00:23:39.90
They'd been slaves for some 400 years.

375
00:23:39.90 --> 00:23:46.14
He therefore set to work to train them for the task and to forge the weapon which

376
00:23:46.14 --> 00:23:48.70
would conquer, gain it.

377
00:23:48.70 --> 00:23:49.70
It's interesting.

378
00:23:49.70 --> 00:23:53.06
He talks about the training of armies as forging weapons.

379
00:23:53.06 --> 00:23:54.22
Like you're forging this weapon.

380
00:23:54.22 --> 00:23:56.06
I think that's a pretty cool analogy.

381
00:23:56.06 --> 00:24:01.22
I believe that Moses intentionally kept Israel for 40 years in the desert for two generations

382
00:24:01.22 --> 00:24:06.74
in order to breed and train a fighting race capable of undertaking the task of conquest

383
00:24:06.74 --> 00:24:10.18
which lay at hand.

384
00:24:10.18 --> 00:24:14.82
And in that 40 years, he taught them gradually how to fight and conquer.

385
00:24:14.82 --> 00:24:17.62
He took meticulous care over their training.

386
00:24:17.62 --> 00:24:22.98
And it is most interesting to note his refusal ever to risk any failures into action.

387
00:24:22.98 --> 00:24:23.98
This is interesting.

388
00:24:23.98 --> 00:24:25.10
He brings this up quite a bit.

389
00:24:25.10 --> 00:24:29.50
So Moses didn't take any risk where he thought he might fail.

390
00:24:29.50 --> 00:24:36.10
We read of him soon after leaving Egypt asking if he might lead Israel through the country

391
00:24:36.10 --> 00:24:37.42
of another people.

392
00:24:37.42 --> 00:24:41.54
On being refused permission, he marches round by another way.

393
00:24:41.54 --> 00:24:46.42
But later when the same situation arises when Israel is better trained to fight, he leads

394
00:24:46.42 --> 00:24:52.34
his people straight through the middle of that country and destroys his enemy utterly.

395
00:24:52.34 --> 00:24:58.10
He was a good judge of what Israel was capable of doing and what Israel was not capable

396
00:24:58.10 --> 00:25:03.54
of doing and as a result, he had an unbroken record of military successes.

397
00:25:03.54 --> 00:25:07.94
He had the wisdom and the insight into human nature to realize that the best way for a

398
00:25:07.94 --> 00:25:12.74
leader to gain confidence of his soldiers is to give them victories.

399
00:25:12.74 --> 00:25:18.94
If a commander gives his soldiers victories, they will follow him anywhere.

400
00:25:18.94 --> 00:25:23.14
But Moses was not permitted to see the fruits of his own work.

401
00:25:23.14 --> 00:25:28.82
He sinned by claiming as his own powers which did not belong to him and for this sin of

402
00:25:28.82 --> 00:25:34.30
presumption he was forced to hand over to Joshua the final conquest of Canaan for which

403
00:25:34.30 --> 00:25:36.66
he had so well trained to the children of Israel.

404
00:25:36.66 --> 00:25:42.18
So there he wraps up on Moses.

405
00:25:42.18 --> 00:25:47.74
I think and he kind of refers back to this point later in this book is the fact that you

406
00:25:47.74 --> 00:25:51.78
got to be, you got to push for victory, right?

407
00:25:51.78 --> 00:25:56.94
You got to push for victory and this is, it's almost like risk of version, right?

408
00:25:56.94 --> 00:26:04.86
Which I'm not a fan of and you can't be risk of averse but you got to be calculated.

409
00:26:04.86 --> 00:26:10.50
To the book and the next section he is going to talk about Kramwell.

410
00:26:10.50 --> 00:26:13.14
He just refers to him as Kramwell, all of a Kramwell.

411
00:26:13.14 --> 00:26:20.54
Kramwell, who was an English statement but he was a soldier.

412
00:26:20.54 --> 00:26:32.58
This is like in the 1600s, 1620s he was a hardcore Puritan and he organized military forces

413
00:26:32.58 --> 00:26:37.86
in the civil war broke out 1642.

414
00:26:37.86 --> 00:26:41.06
He was the deputy commander of the new model army.

415
00:26:41.06 --> 00:26:48.10
He defeated the main royalist force in 1645 and then he commanded campaigns in Ireland

416
00:26:48.10 --> 00:26:52.86
in Scotland in the 1650s.

417
00:26:52.86 --> 00:26:59.50
He was kind of over the top, I guess you might say.

418
00:26:59.50 --> 00:27:06.70
I mean beyond that he had there was an Irish massacre, you know, and that spiraled into

419
00:27:06.70 --> 00:27:14.82
a war for hundreds of years and ultimately as a politician once he kind of got done with

420
00:27:14.82 --> 00:27:19.34
a war part he became a politician and he really didn't do a great job.

421
00:27:19.34 --> 00:27:24.66
That's just some kind of highlights of Oliver Kramwell.

422
00:27:24.66 --> 00:27:29.42
Thank you, we go back to the book, I next proposed to consider Kramwell another leader who

423
00:27:29.42 --> 00:27:34.78
went to wage war only when he was over middle age.

424
00:27:34.78 --> 00:27:37.14
He was over 40 when the civil war broke out.

425
00:27:37.14 --> 00:27:41.34
He started the civil war in command of a troop of 60 men and then commanded of that troop

426
00:27:41.34 --> 00:27:43.54
he fought at edge hill.

427
00:27:43.54 --> 00:27:48.18
There in spite of the parliamentary superiority and men and guns and the feet perfectly

428
00:27:48.18 --> 00:27:53.54
held cause he saw the failure of his own side to seize the victory and he saw them

429
00:27:53.54 --> 00:27:57.86
escape defeat only because of the folly of their opponents.

430
00:27:57.86 --> 00:28:01.94
This gave him much cause for thought.

431
00:28:01.94 --> 00:28:08.10
Superiority in men and equipment was clearly valueless unless something further was added.

432
00:28:08.10 --> 00:28:10.82
This is part that I kind of got fired up for.

433
00:28:10.82 --> 00:28:19.22
What was needed also, so besides guns, good superiority and man superiority equipment, what

434
00:28:19.22 --> 00:28:26.18
was needed also was the leader who would forge the weapon out of the enthusiastic material

435
00:28:26.18 --> 00:28:32.74
available and would then lead it with bigger and determination to achieve his military

436
00:28:32.74 --> 00:28:38.10
and so once again we're talking about what leader can take this leader can forge a weapon

437
00:28:38.10 --> 00:28:40.82
from men.

438
00:28:40.82 --> 00:28:46.26
He saw to the nature of the weapon required and how it could be forged.

439
00:28:46.26 --> 00:28:51.78
So he started to understand the men as a weapon and how you could forge this weapon properly

440
00:28:51.78 --> 00:28:59.14
and he set himself to task to the task of building a force after his own principles based

441
00:28:59.14 --> 00:29:07.22
on a high fighting spirit, spirit, good discipline and a sound knowledge of tactics.

442
00:29:07.22 --> 00:29:13.30
It was to be a force which would have complete confidence in him as their commander.

443
00:29:13.30 --> 00:29:19.94
So this guy saw this situation where they almost got crushed the parliamentary forces were so

444
00:29:19.94 --> 00:29:23.78
disorganized that they couldn't even take advantage of it and he saw this my opportunity.

445
00:29:23.78 --> 00:29:25.78
And those are great lessons.

446
00:29:25.78 --> 00:29:29.70
Love it when you learn the lesson that you didn't really have to pay for.

447
00:29:29.70 --> 00:29:30.70
It happened sometimes.

448
00:29:30.70 --> 00:29:32.26
It happens in MMA sometimes.

449
00:29:32.26 --> 00:29:36.34
When you guy wins a fight because something you get lucky in the end and you get to go

450
00:29:36.34 --> 00:29:40.58
and we've got the W but we also got to learn a great lesson to happen and combat all the

451
00:29:40.58 --> 00:29:41.58
time.

452
00:29:41.58 --> 00:29:45.26
Back off in operation you were like man if we would have gotten hit at this particular

453
00:29:45.26 --> 00:29:49.50
moment we had security was down we were not paying attention we didn't have this flank

454
00:29:49.50 --> 00:29:54.86
covered and by the grace of God we didn't get contacted from that area but we can't let

455
00:29:54.86 --> 00:29:55.86
that happen again.

456
00:29:55.86 --> 00:29:58.78
So sometimes you learn the lesson even though you didn't have to pay for it and that's what

457
00:29:58.78 --> 00:30:00.70
it sounds like happened here.

458
00:30:00.70 --> 00:30:01.70
Back to the book.

459
00:30:01.70 --> 00:30:07.50
He said about his task full we are told of a furious zeal, a fire in his belly which

460
00:30:07.50 --> 00:30:10.10
compelled him which compelled others to follow him.

461
00:30:10.10 --> 00:30:14.34
He had complete confidence in his ability to gain success in war.

462
00:30:14.34 --> 00:30:19.14
He saw the way in which he had to train his men to fight and the few essentials which

463
00:30:19.14 --> 00:30:24.38
would ensure success provided his men had the right fighting spirit.

464
00:30:24.38 --> 00:30:32.38
Ed Jail was fought in October 1642 with Cromwell as a captain of a troop of horse 60 strong

465
00:30:32.38 --> 00:30:35.66
by January 1644.

466
00:30:35.66 --> 00:30:41.02
He was a lieutenant general second in command of Manchester's army of the eastern counties

467
00:30:41.02 --> 00:30:46.78
but leading cavalry commander on the parlor of entry side and the one outstanding commander

468
00:30:46.78 --> 00:30:50.38
in the parlor of entry army.

469
00:30:50.38 --> 00:30:52.42
So he made a rapid transition.

470
00:30:52.42 --> 00:30:57.10
Now he gets into this Cromwell was not a likable man.

471
00:30:57.10 --> 00:31:03.10
He was quick tempered believed in rigid discipline and constant training and he drove his

472
00:31:03.10 --> 00:31:09.86
men hard but he believed with a blinding certainty in the righteousness of his cause.

473
00:31:09.86 --> 00:31:15.26
He infused his soldiers with its righteousness and he was convinced of his own ability to

474
00:31:15.26 --> 00:31:17.54
succeed to achieve success in battle.

475
00:31:17.54 --> 00:31:22.58
This is one of those things where you know when you hear that people that monti was a

476
00:31:22.58 --> 00:31:27.94
little bit like lact tact, this is one of those things where I think well did he read

477
00:31:27.94 --> 00:31:28.94
this.

478
00:31:28.94 --> 00:31:32.34
He read about Cromwell and study Cromwell and say well look no one like Cromwell.

479
00:31:32.34 --> 00:31:35.62
You can tell me a good thing you don't have to be liked.

480
00:31:35.62 --> 00:31:42.58
In fact, lafel tell the story there was a guy that was late for teaching a class to young

481
00:31:42.58 --> 00:31:49.38
seals and there was a seal officer that would come in and say you shouldn't be liked

482
00:31:49.38 --> 00:31:52.10
if you're in charge.

483
00:31:52.10 --> 00:31:55.66
And lafes you know it's sitting the back of the room and think to himself this is not

484
00:31:55.66 --> 00:31:58.10
good because that's not true.

485
00:31:58.10 --> 00:32:05.26
Now it's probably true that what the guy was trying to say is listen you're not always

486
00:32:05.26 --> 00:32:06.78
going to be popular for you.

487
00:32:06.78 --> 00:32:11.34
Your goal should not be to be liked which I agree with.

488
00:32:11.34 --> 00:32:14.34
But to say look you're going to be hated by your troops that's just the way it is

489
00:32:14.34 --> 00:32:15.34
and that's wrong.

490
00:32:15.34 --> 00:32:17.34
If you're hated by your troops you're probably doing something wrong.

491
00:32:17.34 --> 00:32:18.34
Yeah.

492
00:32:18.34 --> 00:32:19.34
Yeah.

493
00:32:19.34 --> 00:32:25.46
And to say that if you're essentially the what the guy that lafes talking about, if you say

494
00:32:25.46 --> 00:32:28.50
and if you're liked by your troops you're doing something wrong.

495
00:32:28.50 --> 00:32:29.50
Yeah, that's true too.

496
00:32:29.50 --> 00:32:30.50
What it feels like.

497
00:32:30.50 --> 00:32:37.78
So I understand that thought as well like hey everyone loves me I must be doing a good

498
00:32:37.78 --> 00:32:38.78
job.

499
00:32:38.78 --> 00:32:41.38
Actually if everyone just thinks you're their buddy that's a problem.

500
00:32:41.38 --> 00:32:47.74
So this may have been what this officer was trying to teach to the young officers

501
00:32:47.74 --> 00:32:50.70
that that life was in charge of instructing.

502
00:32:50.70 --> 00:32:54.46
I'm sure he tried to was trying to say the right thing.

503
00:32:54.46 --> 00:33:00.22
But perhaps he wasn't articulating it 100% in the most clear way with a guy because

504
00:33:00.22 --> 00:33:04.18
just to tell you hey you're not going to be liked where your officer.

505
00:33:04.18 --> 00:33:05.18
Not true.

506
00:33:05.18 --> 00:33:06.18
Not true.

507
00:33:06.18 --> 00:33:07.18
And not good.

508
00:33:07.18 --> 00:33:11.18
If I have if I look at a seal between and the seal between doesn't like their officer

509
00:33:11.18 --> 00:33:12.18
that's not a positive sign.

510
00:33:12.18 --> 00:33:13.18
Yeah.

511
00:33:13.18 --> 00:33:14.62
That does not mean that guy is a good leader.

512
00:33:14.62 --> 00:33:19.02
Now it's also not a good sign if all the seal between everyone loves him that doesn't

513
00:33:19.02 --> 00:33:21.02
mean it's good good between either.

514
00:33:21.02 --> 00:33:26.34
So you can be loved but you're not doing a good job and you can be hated and you can be

515
00:33:26.34 --> 00:33:28.94
no good job but you're probably not going to be able to pull off to a good job.

516
00:33:28.94 --> 00:33:33.22
When guys don't like you they're not going to put forth any real effort to make you look

517
00:33:33.22 --> 00:33:34.94
good is basically what they're doing.

518
00:33:34.94 --> 00:33:35.94
Yeah.

519
00:33:35.94 --> 00:33:40.34
And at the end of the day it obviously seems like it's just not that cut in dry.

520
00:33:40.34 --> 00:33:41.34
No, no.

521
00:33:41.34 --> 00:33:42.34
No.

522
00:33:42.34 --> 00:33:46.98
Back to the book and he did achieve success.

523
00:33:46.98 --> 00:33:53.10
He had no failures and if a commander has a righteous cause and gives his soldier success

524
00:33:53.10 --> 00:33:58.98
he will gain the complete confidence of his men and then there is nothing he cannot do.

525
00:33:58.98 --> 00:34:05.74
But the power which his prowess in the field at one for him led Cromwell to seize the

526
00:34:05.74 --> 00:34:08.54
reins of government for himself.

527
00:34:08.54 --> 00:34:14.42
He became impatient with the inefficiency methods, inefficiency of the parliamentary

528
00:34:14.42 --> 00:34:20.14
government of those days and he compared it unfavorably with his own ability as a soldier

529
00:34:20.14 --> 00:34:25.54
to give immediate decision and to see it take shape at once in action.

530
00:34:25.54 --> 00:34:30.58
So he took over the government and he wanted things to move real quick.

531
00:34:30.58 --> 00:34:34.42
But unfortunately.

532
00:34:34.42 --> 00:34:39.14
But as in battle he had been sure of the correct course of action.

533
00:34:39.14 --> 00:34:43.66
So in the political field he was on many occasions uncertain and perplexed during the

534
00:34:43.66 --> 00:34:45.90
period in which he ruled England.

535
00:34:45.90 --> 00:34:51.38
He tried out five different systems of government and all failed.

536
00:34:51.38 --> 00:34:57.30
And at the end he was governing alone and much more absolutely than ever Charles had attempted

537
00:34:57.30 --> 00:34:58.30
to rule.

538
00:34:58.30 --> 00:35:02.02
Internally he taxed the people more highly and he disregarded parliament more

539
00:35:02.02 --> 00:35:07.42
brazenly than Charles had never done and he interfered with the personal liberty more

540
00:35:07.42 --> 00:35:09.90
tyrannously.

541
00:35:09.90 --> 00:35:14.14
In Ireland also his harsh and cruel policy left the lasting hatred which the centuries

542
00:35:14.14 --> 00:35:16.42
have not quenched.

543
00:35:16.42 --> 00:35:18.90
But his rule was not wholly unproductive.

544
00:35:18.90 --> 00:35:20.54
He made the fighting sir.

545
00:35:20.54 --> 00:35:22.06
So he did accomplish one thing.

546
00:35:22.06 --> 00:35:26.42
He made the fighting services the finest in the world and he gained for England a voice

547
00:35:26.42 --> 00:35:29.74
and the affairs of Europe such as England had never had before.

548
00:35:29.74 --> 00:35:34.54
So he was not a good governmental leader.

549
00:35:34.54 --> 00:35:41.42
Many of his triumphs abroad were transient and unsubstantial and much that he attempted

550
00:35:41.42 --> 00:35:44.18
at home disappeared when he died.

551
00:35:44.18 --> 00:35:49.06
But his work for the Navy and its initial steps toward the creation of an empire planted

552
00:35:49.06 --> 00:35:51.82
a foundation from which much has grown.

553
00:35:51.82 --> 00:35:59.62
So he did had a good impact on the military but his governmental leading abilities or

554
00:35:59.62 --> 00:36:03.18
all that straddle.

555
00:36:03.18 --> 00:36:08.46
The third great captain I suppose to I propose to consider is Napoleon.

556
00:36:08.46 --> 00:36:11.74
A leader driven by selfish and evil ambition.

557
00:36:11.74 --> 00:36:14.22
That's interesting.

558
00:36:14.22 --> 00:36:17.26
And not like the other two in pursuit of a great ideal.

559
00:36:17.26 --> 00:36:20.58
Unlike the other two he was a soldier by profession.

560
00:36:20.58 --> 00:36:24.38
Train from his youth in the profession of arms even as a very young boy in a military

561
00:36:24.38 --> 00:36:27.34
academy he was clearly a leader.

562
00:36:27.34 --> 00:36:31.50
He wished to dominate and he did dominate his fellow men.

563
00:36:31.50 --> 00:36:32.50
There it is.

564
00:36:32.50 --> 00:36:34.06
Now one sounds a little stronger.

565
00:36:34.06 --> 00:36:37.78
That sounds a little bit more like what I think a dominate.

566
00:36:37.78 --> 00:36:43.74
Again, unlike the other two he rose at a very early age to a high and independent command

567
00:36:43.74 --> 00:36:50.02
at the age of 26 he took command of the army of Italy and army inferior numbers and equipment

568
00:36:50.02 --> 00:36:55.78
to its opponents and semi-muteness from lack of pay.

569
00:36:55.78 --> 00:37:01.90
Yet within a year with this inferior weapon which he re-forged to his liking he fought brilliantly

570
00:37:01.90 --> 00:37:05.54
successful campaign in northern Italy and imposed peace on his enemy.

571
00:37:05.54 --> 00:37:06.70
I like that.

572
00:37:06.70 --> 00:37:10.26
Imposed peace on his enemies.

573
00:37:10.26 --> 00:37:15.10
From the moment of his arrival with his army he dominated his troops both generals and soldiers

574
00:37:15.10 --> 00:37:19.34
and inspired them with confidence in his ability to give them success.

575
00:37:19.34 --> 00:37:24.22
Of that ability he himself had never any doubt.

576
00:37:24.22 --> 00:37:30.42
And in his own self confidence lay much of his power to inspire confidence in others.

577
00:37:30.42 --> 00:37:38.38
Behind this dominating self confidence however, lay Napoleon's ability to see in any military

578
00:37:38.38 --> 00:37:45.54
problem the few essentials on which success would depend.

579
00:37:45.54 --> 00:37:52.18
He had the great power to simplify any problem and to see what details were important

580
00:37:52.18 --> 00:37:54.30
and which were unimportant.

581
00:37:54.30 --> 00:37:55.46
There you go.

582
00:37:55.46 --> 00:37:58.94
That's prioritizing execute and it's simple both in one big rule.

583
00:37:58.94 --> 00:37:59.94
Right?

584
00:37:59.94 --> 00:38:01.74
You've got to know what's important.

585
00:38:01.74 --> 00:38:06.14
You've got to prioritize the importance things and you've got to keep everything simple.

586
00:38:06.14 --> 00:38:12.42
I've got to email from Sarah Armstrong.

587
00:38:12.42 --> 00:38:18.58
Talking about podcast 174 trying to be a 50.

588
00:38:18.58 --> 00:38:26.30
Trying to be a 50 in all categories and she basically emailed me and said, hey heads up.

589
00:38:26.30 --> 00:38:33.06
I used to try and be a 50 in every category even in categories that didn't matter.

590
00:38:33.06 --> 00:38:37.90
So that's, you know, give people heads up and I was like, well yeah I mean I've talked about

591
00:38:37.90 --> 00:38:38.90
that.

592
00:38:38.90 --> 00:38:42.46
I talked about it with clients all the time but I talked about it on the podcast as well.

593
00:38:42.46 --> 00:38:47.14
When specifically I talked about it saying, I don't know if you remember this example,

594
00:38:47.14 --> 00:38:51.42
I said a black belt in due to like they don't care.

595
00:38:51.42 --> 00:38:53.46
We are grabbing their sleeve and you're getting all crazy.

596
00:38:53.46 --> 00:38:54.46
They don't care.

597
00:38:54.46 --> 00:38:56.26
That doesn't matter.

598
00:38:56.26 --> 00:38:59.02
If you're a white belt, someone grabs your sleeve, you're freaking out.

599
00:38:59.02 --> 00:39:01.02
But if you're, if you're a black belt, take okay.

600
00:39:01.02 --> 00:39:05.94
If you're a good leader and there's some, some, some issue that guys are complaining about.

601
00:39:05.94 --> 00:39:06.94
It's no factor.

602
00:39:06.94 --> 00:39:07.94
Don't care.

603
00:39:07.94 --> 00:39:10.14
And then there's some issues that come up to you.

604
00:39:10.14 --> 00:39:11.14
Okay, that's important.

605
00:39:11.14 --> 00:39:11.98
I need to address that.

606
00:39:11.98 --> 00:39:15.02
So this is what he had the ability to do.

607
00:39:15.02 --> 00:39:17.02
What is essential and what is not.

608
00:39:17.02 --> 00:39:18.02
Yeah.

609
00:39:18.02 --> 00:39:22.10
Yeah, and that's that can be kind of a tricky one because you know, some, some things are super

610
00:39:22.10 --> 00:39:23.10
small, super small.

611
00:39:23.10 --> 00:39:26.18
But at the end of the day, they might be kind of important.

612
00:39:26.18 --> 00:39:28.78
Yes, you know, like you can sort of predict you like, hey, that's small.

613
00:39:28.78 --> 00:39:29.78
Sure.

614
00:39:29.78 --> 00:39:33.18
But hey, I could see that like continuing and growing, you know.

615
00:39:33.18 --> 00:39:34.18
For sure.

616
00:39:34.18 --> 00:39:36.30
And sometimes all you have to do is monitor it.

617
00:39:36.30 --> 00:39:37.54
Did make sure it doesn't grow.

618
00:39:37.54 --> 00:39:38.54
Yeah.

619
00:39:38.54 --> 00:39:41.02
Sometimes you have to put in check for sure, sometimes you have to.

620
00:39:41.02 --> 00:39:42.02
Destroy something.

621
00:39:42.02 --> 00:39:43.02
Remove it.

622
00:39:43.02 --> 00:39:44.02
Kill it.

623
00:39:44.02 --> 00:39:45.02
Yeah.

624
00:39:45.02 --> 00:39:48.46
Sometimes you can't worry about it because it's not important.

625
00:39:48.46 --> 00:39:50.34
So you got to figure which one of those out.

626
00:39:50.34 --> 00:39:53.06
Like if you're employee.

627
00:39:53.06 --> 00:39:57.90
Say your boss, your employee comes in one minute late.

628
00:39:57.90 --> 00:40:02.74
Let's say comes in on time every single time like, but right now he has to get there at six.

629
00:40:02.74 --> 00:40:04.58
Get there at six on the dot every single day.

630
00:40:04.58 --> 00:40:05.58
Yeah.

631
00:40:05.58 --> 00:40:09.46
And then like one week on Monday comes in at six.

632
00:40:09.46 --> 00:40:12.78
It's not a big problem.

633
00:40:12.78 --> 00:40:15.54
One day, no, it's not a problem.

634
00:40:15.54 --> 00:40:17.38
You might want to throw a little something.

635
00:40:17.38 --> 00:40:18.38
Right.

636
00:40:18.38 --> 00:40:19.38
It's not something little something.

637
00:40:19.38 --> 00:40:20.38
It's not nothing.

638
00:40:20.38 --> 00:40:21.38
Yeah.

639
00:40:21.38 --> 00:40:22.38
So it's not something.

640
00:40:22.38 --> 00:40:24.86
It's like a long, this is probably what I'd say.

641
00:40:24.86 --> 00:40:25.86
Huh?

642
00:40:25.86 --> 00:40:28.02
See what happens when you cut it so close every day.

643
00:40:28.02 --> 00:40:30.30
You're already a little, you're missed it by a minute, bro.

644
00:40:30.30 --> 00:40:31.30
Exactly.

645
00:40:31.30 --> 00:40:32.30
Right.

646
00:40:32.30 --> 00:40:33.30
That's just throw a little, little.

647
00:40:33.30 --> 00:40:34.30
Yeah.

648
00:40:34.30 --> 00:40:35.30
Just let him know you're watching.

649
00:40:35.30 --> 00:40:36.30
Yeah.

650
00:40:36.30 --> 00:40:38.86
Just like I said, like, some things they're teeny, but they're not going to give it to you.

651
00:40:38.86 --> 00:40:40.82
Am I going to give a dude a written counseling?

652
00:40:40.82 --> 00:40:41.82
Because they were one minute late.

653
00:40:41.82 --> 00:40:42.82
No.

654
00:40:42.82 --> 00:40:43.82
Right.

655
00:40:43.82 --> 00:40:44.82
Because now the guys are looking for different jobs and works.

656
00:40:44.82 --> 00:40:45.82
He doesn't want to work from you.

657
00:40:45.82 --> 00:40:46.82
Yeah.

658
00:40:46.82 --> 00:40:47.82
He spas out on him.

659
00:40:47.82 --> 00:40:49.30
But at the same time.

660
00:40:49.30 --> 00:40:50.30
He's at six.

661
00:40:50.30 --> 00:40:51.30
So one is like cool.

662
00:40:51.30 --> 00:40:53.38
So next day comes in at six o'clock.

663
00:40:53.38 --> 00:40:54.38
We'll say next day.

664
00:40:54.38 --> 00:40:57.02
Then the next Monday comes in at six o'clock.

665
00:40:57.02 --> 00:40:58.02
Oh, two knots.

666
00:40:58.02 --> 00:40:59.02
Just one more minute.

667
00:40:59.02 --> 00:41:00.02
Right.

668
00:41:00.02 --> 00:41:02.02
Got to put it in check.

669
00:41:02.02 --> 00:41:03.02
Yeah.

670
00:41:03.02 --> 00:41:04.70
So you just a little something.

671
00:41:04.70 --> 00:41:05.70
Same like something.

672
00:41:05.70 --> 00:41:07.86
They seem small, but you take a broader view.

673
00:41:07.86 --> 00:41:09.82
Well, like, hey, it's kind of important.

674
00:41:09.82 --> 00:41:10.82
Yeah.

675
00:41:10.82 --> 00:41:15.94
This goes back to the troop shaving and the Soviet troops stopping shaving.

676
00:41:15.94 --> 00:41:16.94
This is it.

677
00:41:16.94 --> 00:41:18.66
This is the slippery slope of a lack of discipline.

678
00:41:18.66 --> 00:41:19.66
This is slippery.

679
00:41:19.66 --> 00:41:20.66
Yeah.

680
00:41:20.66 --> 00:41:22.82
I can tell you this.

681
00:41:22.82 --> 00:41:28.62
If you're focused only on these little things, you might miss the big picture, which

682
00:41:28.62 --> 00:41:30.34
was Sarah's point.

683
00:41:30.34 --> 00:41:34.62
And I responded and I said, hey, I totally agreed with her.

684
00:41:34.62 --> 00:41:37.34
Talked about some of the black belt thing and then the boss thing.

685
00:41:37.34 --> 00:41:41.34
And then I was like, and by the way, because this is something I've talked about.

686
00:41:41.34 --> 00:41:47.78
The floor in my garage gym is not to clean.

687
00:41:47.78 --> 00:41:51.70
It gets a 2.0 on cleanliness.

688
00:41:51.70 --> 00:41:52.70
How to what?

689
00:41:52.70 --> 00:41:53.70
Out of five.

690
00:41:53.70 --> 00:41:54.70
Maybe even gets a one.

691
00:41:54.70 --> 00:41:55.70
I think one man.

692
00:41:55.70 --> 00:41:56.70
Yeah, maybe gets a two.

693
00:41:56.70 --> 00:41:57.70
No, no, no.

694
00:41:57.70 --> 00:42:00.94
However, it gets like a 1.5.

695
00:42:00.94 --> 00:42:04.58
Because it's not, it's not, it doesn't have actual dirt on it.

696
00:42:04.58 --> 00:42:09.86
It's just got, it's just got a chalk and sweat stains.

697
00:42:09.86 --> 00:42:10.86
Yeah.

698
00:42:10.86 --> 00:42:11.86
Dryed up utility.

699
00:42:11.86 --> 00:42:12.86
Yeah.

700
00:42:12.86 --> 00:42:13.86
Not the glass to get.

701
00:42:13.86 --> 00:42:14.86
Yeah.

702
00:42:14.86 --> 00:42:22.02
It would take 20 minutes to half an hour each day to keep that thing at a 5.0 inspection

703
00:42:22.02 --> 00:42:23.02
ready level.

704
00:42:23.02 --> 00:42:25.22
Because once you've got to get in there and space, basically you got a power wash that

705
00:42:25.22 --> 00:42:26.22
thing daily.

706
00:42:26.22 --> 00:42:27.22
That's where you're at.

707
00:42:27.22 --> 00:42:29.62
So I'm not power washing that thing daily.

708
00:42:29.62 --> 00:42:30.62
Why is it?

709
00:42:30.62 --> 00:42:31.90
Why is it not clean?

710
00:42:31.90 --> 00:42:33.22
Not important.

711
00:42:33.22 --> 00:42:40.62
Do I have, I actually have a vacuum in my garage that I hit it with.

712
00:42:40.62 --> 00:42:42.50
Sometimes I hit it every two, three days.

713
00:42:42.50 --> 00:42:47.26
That's a lot different than breaking out of, then pulling the mats out, power washing them

714
00:42:47.26 --> 00:42:51.42
in the alley and then bringing them back in.

715
00:42:51.42 --> 00:42:52.90
That's not even half an hour.

716
00:42:52.90 --> 00:42:56.90
That's like a, that's a serious evolution.

717
00:42:56.90 --> 00:42:58.58
That's a serious evolution.

718
00:42:58.58 --> 00:43:04.14
So is it worth being a 5.0 in Matt, cleanliness garage gym?

719
00:43:04.14 --> 00:43:05.46
The answer is no.

720
00:43:05.46 --> 00:43:06.46
The answer is no.

721
00:43:06.46 --> 00:43:07.46
It's not worth it.

722
00:43:07.46 --> 00:43:09.62
You need to lower that on the priorities scale.

723
00:43:09.62 --> 00:43:16.94
Now, do I have big chunks of dirt and dog hair piled up and debris?

724
00:43:16.94 --> 00:43:17.94
No.

725
00:43:17.94 --> 00:43:22.82
It's completely debris free.

726
00:43:22.82 --> 00:43:24.74
But there are some sweat stains on it.

727
00:43:24.74 --> 00:43:28.26
There has been some, there are the remnants of getting after it.

728
00:43:28.26 --> 00:43:29.26
Sure.

729
00:43:29.26 --> 00:43:30.26
Right, which is kind of conducive.

730
00:43:30.26 --> 00:43:31.26
Can be the way it is.

731
00:43:31.26 --> 00:43:32.26
Yeah.

732
00:43:32.26 --> 00:43:34.10
So what's the standard then generally speaking?

733
00:43:34.10 --> 00:43:37.66
Not just an application to your garage gym floor.

734
00:43:37.66 --> 00:43:39.58
You feel like everything, it's like little things.

735
00:43:39.58 --> 00:43:43.18
I mean, just a basic little framework to establish.

736
00:43:43.18 --> 00:43:44.18
It depends on the thing.

737
00:43:44.18 --> 00:43:45.18
Yeah.

738
00:43:45.18 --> 00:43:46.18
So, but what is it?

739
00:43:46.18 --> 00:43:47.62
So you can go, it's like you go fundamentally then.

740
00:43:47.62 --> 00:43:54.06
So what is it like, if it gets in the way, even if this much, even if it's little millimeter,

741
00:43:54.06 --> 00:43:57.58
gets in the way of the overall objective then, it's relevant?

742
00:43:57.58 --> 00:43:58.58
Important.

743
00:43:58.58 --> 00:43:59.58
Well, no.

744
00:43:59.58 --> 00:44:03.78
Then we just have to frame it so that we're not, whether we frame it as a waste of time.

745
00:44:03.78 --> 00:44:05.70
How much effort are you going to put into that?

746
00:44:05.70 --> 00:44:06.70
Right.

747
00:44:06.70 --> 00:44:12.78
If it's not, if it doesn't get in the way, if it, no, no, if it gets in the way,

748
00:44:12.78 --> 00:44:14.42
then I'm putting too much time.

749
00:44:14.42 --> 00:44:18.42
If it gets in the way of my strategic goal, it's to bump putting too much time into it.

750
00:44:18.42 --> 00:44:21.02
Okay, if solving this, it's the particular problem.

751
00:44:21.02 --> 00:44:22.94
Yeah, yes, yes, okay.

752
00:44:22.94 --> 00:44:27.10
But I meant the existing of a small little problem, if it gets in the way.

753
00:44:27.10 --> 00:44:28.74
So like the way it's like, it's like, it's a problem.

754
00:44:28.74 --> 00:44:29.74
Right.

755
00:44:29.74 --> 00:44:30.74
I gotta fix it.

756
00:44:30.74 --> 00:44:31.74
Yeah.

757
00:44:31.74 --> 00:44:33.86
So if it does like the guy coming in late.

758
00:44:33.86 --> 00:44:41.70
Let's say on my garage floor, there was chunks of rocks underneath the mats.

759
00:44:41.70 --> 00:44:43.70
And they made it uneven.

760
00:44:43.70 --> 00:44:49.74
And it was like slightly hazardous for me to be moving around on it.

761
00:44:49.74 --> 00:44:52.10
And it interrupted and my weights rolled around.

762
00:44:52.10 --> 00:44:53.10
That'd be a problem.

763
00:44:53.10 --> 00:44:54.10
Yes.

764
00:44:54.10 --> 00:44:56.10
It's affecting my strategic goal.

765
00:44:56.10 --> 00:44:57.50
Those mats are getting picked up.

766
00:44:57.50 --> 00:44:58.50
The rocks are getting moved.

767
00:44:58.50 --> 00:45:01.38
The floor is getting leveled and we're going to go.

768
00:45:01.38 --> 00:45:05.62
On the on this level, my mats get a five-o.

769
00:45:05.62 --> 00:45:07.18
They're perfectly flat.

770
00:45:07.18 --> 00:45:08.18
Yeah.

771
00:45:08.18 --> 00:45:09.18
They're good to go.

772
00:45:09.18 --> 00:45:11.98
They're do not interfere at all.

773
00:45:11.98 --> 00:45:14.98
But they got some getting after it stains on them.

774
00:45:14.98 --> 00:45:15.98
Yep, there it is.

775
00:45:15.98 --> 00:45:23.50
Okay, going back to the book, having grasped the essentials of the problem and having

776
00:45:23.50 --> 00:45:29.06
inspired his soldiers with confidence in himself and with high morale, he knew he could

777
00:45:29.06 --> 00:45:31.06
not fail.

778
00:45:31.06 --> 00:45:35.06
Napoleon, however, was always as much a politician as a soldier.

779
00:45:35.06 --> 00:45:42.22
He had a great love of intrigue and of diplomatic bargaining and his contempt for his fellow men

780
00:45:42.22 --> 00:45:48.78
and his passion to dominate them and events led him to aspire to greater things.

781
00:45:48.78 --> 00:45:55.56
From the time he became first console, political rather than military factors influenced

782
00:45:55.56 --> 00:46:01.04
his decisions and his failure to reconcile his political aspirations with what was

783
00:46:01.04 --> 00:46:08.96
militarily possible, finally led him to the disasters of Moscow and the peninsula from which

784
00:46:08.96 --> 00:46:11.96
no recovery was possible.

785
00:46:11.96 --> 00:46:16.000
He started playing that political game.

786
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.28
Started making his military decisions based on what he wanted to happen politically.

787
00:46:21.28 --> 00:46:26.44
Now what did these three men Moses, Kromwell and Napoleon, have in common without which they

788
00:46:26.44 --> 00:46:29.08
would have not achieved success?

789
00:46:29.08 --> 00:46:34.96
The most outstanding similarity was that they dominated their fellow men.

790
00:46:34.96 --> 00:46:43.08
They were all supremely confident that they could and would do what they set out to do.

791
00:46:43.08 --> 00:46:47.96
It was quite simple to them, quite easy and success was absolutely certain.

792
00:46:47.96 --> 00:46:52.76
This certainty gave them each the power to inspire others to follow blindly and to the

793
00:46:52.76 --> 00:46:58.08
limit of their strength and this inspiration and power to infuse others, immeasurably

794
00:46:58.08 --> 00:47:03.80
increased the power of their forces to achieve whatever was asked to them.

795
00:47:03.80 --> 00:47:07.92
That's called confidence, that's what that is, pure confidence.

796
00:47:07.92 --> 00:47:11.36
Isn't it interesting when you see someone that's ultra confident?

797
00:47:11.36 --> 00:47:19.28
No, they're not even overflowing into ego but they're just really, really confident and

798
00:47:19.28 --> 00:47:20.84
people follow.

799
00:47:20.84 --> 00:47:23.56
People will be like, okay, I'm on board.

800
00:47:23.56 --> 00:47:29.64
This person's in the game, may believe it, imble, imble, I believe it too.

801
00:47:29.64 --> 00:47:34.48
I've seen situations where people are so confident that people are falling and they're

802
00:47:34.48 --> 00:47:35.48
wrong.

803
00:47:35.48 --> 00:47:39.68
You know, you get that occasionally with the seal puttune, you get some experience guy that

804
00:47:39.68 --> 00:47:44.60
was super confident and he actually wasn't that good or didn't really understand tactics

805
00:47:44.60 --> 00:47:45.60
too well.

806
00:47:45.60 --> 00:47:47.60
And he's known as what we're doing.

807
00:47:47.60 --> 00:47:48.60
Yeah, he knows.

808
00:47:48.60 --> 00:47:49.60
So I've done this a million times.

809
00:47:49.60 --> 00:47:50.60
That's all.

810
00:47:50.60 --> 00:47:52.60
By the way, that's a red flag.

811
00:47:52.60 --> 00:47:57.16
Like somebody, when somebody counts on their number of times or their experience, that's

812
00:47:57.16 --> 00:47:58.16
the way we've always done it.

813
00:47:58.16 --> 00:47:59.16
I've done this a million times.

814
00:47:59.16 --> 00:48:00.16
That's a red flag.

815
00:48:00.16 --> 00:48:04.28
The reason that they're using those statements is because they don't have an actual answer.

816
00:48:04.28 --> 00:48:06.68
So one of the new guys says, hey, awesome.

817
00:48:06.68 --> 00:48:11.24
I'm not really sure why we, why are we assaulting through the target from this area over

818
00:48:11.24 --> 00:48:12.84
here, wouldn't it make more sense to do?

819
00:48:12.84 --> 00:48:15.04
And it goes, oh look, I've done this a million times.

820
00:48:15.04 --> 00:48:16.04
This is how we're doing it.

821
00:48:16.04 --> 00:48:17.04
You just think yourself.

822
00:48:17.04 --> 00:48:18.04
So you don't have an actual answer.

823
00:48:18.04 --> 00:48:21.76
You don't have an answer as to why you're just throwing that out there.

824
00:48:21.76 --> 00:48:24.36
That's the easiest thing for you to do.

825
00:48:24.36 --> 00:48:28.52
So if you ever find yourself saying, because this is how we've always done it, or look,

826
00:48:28.52 --> 00:48:30.32
I've been doing this for 28 years.

827
00:48:30.32 --> 00:48:31.32
Yeah, yeah.

828
00:48:31.32 --> 00:48:32.32
I know.

829
00:48:32.32 --> 00:48:35.12
No, you know, you're not a good answer.

830
00:48:35.12 --> 00:48:36.12
You're wrong.

831
00:48:36.12 --> 00:48:37.72
That could work against you to be honest.

832
00:48:37.72 --> 00:48:41.80
Yeah, I've been doing this for 28 years and then like that day and the person figures out

833
00:48:41.80 --> 00:48:45.40
like a way better way to do it and you're like, dang, bro, you've been wasting your time

834
00:48:45.40 --> 00:48:46.40
for 28 years.

835
00:48:46.40 --> 00:48:47.40
Yeah.

836
00:48:47.40 --> 00:48:48.40
Yeah.

837
00:48:48.40 --> 00:48:49.40
It could definitely work out bad.

838
00:48:49.40 --> 00:48:51.000
It could work out bad because you're not listening to anyone else.

839
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.72
You're not taking input and then you end up making a bad decision.

840
00:48:56.72 --> 00:49:01.92
From what did these men get their supreme confidence in their ability to achieve their

841
00:49:01.92 --> 00:49:06.24
purpose and battle, I think they got it from their ability to see their problem in its

842
00:49:06.24 --> 00:49:07.24
simplest form.

843
00:49:07.24 --> 00:49:08.24
Oh, man.

844
00:49:08.24 --> 00:49:09.96
I totally agree with that.

845
00:49:09.96 --> 00:49:13.92
To see the few essentials necessary to the successful solution of the problem and to

846
00:49:13.92 --> 00:49:17.92
see how those few essentials could be achieved.

847
00:49:17.92 --> 00:49:18.92
This is why.

848
00:49:18.92 --> 00:49:23.84
I, I'm always talking about qualities of leadership, the ability to simplify.

849
00:49:23.84 --> 00:49:27.000
I'm sure you've heard me say this a thousand times.

850
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.16
If you have the ability to simplify things, that's a great asset to have and not everyone

851
00:49:31.16 --> 00:49:32.16
has it or not.

852
00:49:32.16 --> 00:49:33.32
Everyone has the same level of it.

853
00:49:33.32 --> 00:49:34.32
Some people are good at it.

854
00:49:34.32 --> 00:49:35.52
Some people not so much.

855
00:49:35.52 --> 00:49:37.24
Some people just straight up complicate things.

856
00:49:37.24 --> 00:49:41.24
Oh, yeah.

857
00:49:41.24 --> 00:49:46.64
Once they grasp the essentials of the problem, they never lost sight of them and never allowed

858
00:49:46.64 --> 00:49:52.52
a massive detail to submerge what was essential to success.

859
00:49:52.52 --> 00:49:55.40
Oh, don't get caught up in the little details of things.

860
00:49:55.40 --> 00:50:00.20
Don't let those things drown out what the real situation is.

861
00:50:00.20 --> 00:50:07.28
For all military problems are in essence simple, but the ability to simplify and to select

862
00:50:07.28 --> 00:50:12.84
out of the massive detail, those things and only those things that are important is not

863
00:50:12.84 --> 00:50:15.60
always so easy.

864
00:50:15.60 --> 00:50:19.12
So, gotta keep things simple.

865
00:50:19.12 --> 00:50:24.52
Each of these men had the power to dominate other men's spirits to inspire their enthusiasm

866
00:50:24.52 --> 00:50:30.48
and to convince them of their own ability to achieve what was asked of them.

867
00:50:30.48 --> 00:50:34.88
This moving of men's spirits, this power to enthuse could only be done and was only

868
00:50:34.88 --> 00:50:39.68
done by their personal contact with their men.

869
00:50:39.68 --> 00:50:43.88
All my three examples were in close and frequent contact with their troops.

870
00:50:43.88 --> 00:50:50.60
They were well-known, familiarly known to them and took frequent opportunities of talking

871
00:50:50.60 --> 00:50:51.60
to their men.

872
00:50:51.60 --> 00:50:56.20
So again, this is where that thing I spoke earlier where it's like he kind of comes

873
00:50:56.20 --> 00:50:59.84
back on A, you gotta be this dominating person.

874
00:50:59.84 --> 00:51:01.76
But he's talking about you gotta get out there and talk to your troops.

875
00:51:01.76 --> 00:51:05.28
You gotta be really truly personally known to them.

876
00:51:05.28 --> 00:51:09.12
Napoleon and Cromwell certainly in very possibly Moses too were known to their men by

877
00:51:09.12 --> 00:51:15.36
nicknames and used this familiarity to help their purpose at the same time each of these

878
00:51:15.36 --> 00:51:20.84
leaders knew well what the soldier was thinking and what he wanted most and they made

879
00:51:20.84 --> 00:51:24.24
always careful study of the human factor.

880
00:51:24.24 --> 00:51:30.24
Now it's interesting because, you know, Monti, he's known as Monti.

881
00:51:30.24 --> 00:51:36.52
Everybody called in Monti and that's his nickname and that little breezy little familiarity.

882
00:51:36.52 --> 00:51:42.12
And like I stole naming a unit renaming a unit when you took it over.

883
00:51:42.12 --> 00:51:43.64
I stole that from David Hacworth.

884
00:51:43.64 --> 00:51:50.24
I wonder if Crom, I wonder if Monti stole this nickname idea and gave himself that nickname.

885
00:51:50.24 --> 00:51:53.80
What does Hacworth took you from Monti?

886
00:51:53.80 --> 00:51:56.76
Well no Hacworth, well actually, is Hacworth, everyone just called Hac Hack.

887
00:51:56.76 --> 00:51:58.60
Hey, everyone called me Jocco.

888
00:51:58.60 --> 00:51:59.60
Like everyone.

889
00:51:59.60 --> 00:52:03.52
It's funny someone said, everyone in the chain of command, the people below me in the

890
00:52:03.52 --> 00:52:06.64
chain of command called me Jocco and the people above me in the chain of command called me

891
00:52:06.64 --> 00:52:07.64
Jocco.

892
00:52:07.64 --> 00:52:08.64
I don't call me Jocco.

893
00:52:08.64 --> 00:52:13.16
So that was kind of cool, but I was just like coincidence, I don't even know why.

894
00:52:13.16 --> 00:52:20.80
But Hacworth, he didn't really, I don't think Hacworth gave himself a nickname.

895
00:52:20.80 --> 00:52:21.80
Yeah.

896
00:52:21.80 --> 00:52:24.68
And let's face it, Hacworth other than Hacworth.

897
00:52:24.68 --> 00:52:32.24
And as General Mucke Yamatollus, he had the best nickname of all time, Mr. infantry.

898
00:52:32.24 --> 00:52:33.56
Is the coolest nickname ever?

899
00:52:33.56 --> 00:52:36.000
Is Hac considered a nickname?

900
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
I think so.

901
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.20
If it's short for your job.

902
00:52:38.20 --> 00:52:39.20
I think it is, yeah.

903
00:52:39.20 --> 00:52:40.20
Yeah.

904
00:52:40.20 --> 00:52:46.04
There are certain names that have an official shortening of it, like Richard and Rick or

905
00:52:46.04 --> 00:52:48.68
you know, Jonathan and John Robert and Bob.

906
00:52:48.68 --> 00:52:49.68
But yes, exactly.

907
00:52:49.68 --> 00:52:51.84
Bill and William and Bill on that.

908
00:52:51.84 --> 00:52:53.72
So Hac is not an official.

909
00:52:53.72 --> 00:52:54.72
Right, it's unofficial.

910
00:52:54.72 --> 00:53:00.000
So it sort of goes into the realm of actual nickname, not just shortening of the name.

911
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Yeah.

912
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Yeah.

913
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.76
I think I don't, we can research this off.

914
00:53:04.76 --> 00:53:08.52
It's not coming to me off the top of my head, but pretty sure everyone called Hacac.

915
00:53:08.52 --> 00:53:09.52
Yeah.

916
00:53:09.52 --> 00:53:11.24
Like up and down the chain of command.

917
00:53:11.24 --> 00:53:14.24
Although his soldiers back in the day probably called him sir.

918
00:53:14.24 --> 00:53:16.04
That's more normal for Vietnam.

919
00:53:16.04 --> 00:53:17.04
Dang.

920
00:53:17.04 --> 00:53:18.52
How do you engineer a nickname, no freeze?

921
00:53:18.52 --> 00:53:19.52
No, you can't do that.

922
00:53:19.52 --> 00:53:22.08
Well, you can't give your nickname to yourself.

923
00:53:22.08 --> 00:53:25.88
No, but you can actually, there has to be a way to sort of engineer the environment.

924
00:53:25.88 --> 00:53:28.12
Oh, you can say, hey, I'm Hac, how's it going?

925
00:53:28.12 --> 00:53:29.12
Yeah.

926
00:53:29.12 --> 00:53:33.32
But the, I mean, if, the, you would have to be established before that, if you just

927
00:53:33.32 --> 00:53:35.72
start like if I just start saying, hey, I'm dragon.

928
00:53:35.72 --> 00:53:39.80
No, if you, if you checked into a military unit or you, you, you know, a new you and

929
00:53:39.80 --> 00:53:40.76
you're like, hey, what's up?

930
00:53:40.76 --> 00:53:42.64
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm dragon boy.

931
00:53:42.64 --> 00:53:44.84
Yeah, but that would be, no, that wouldn't work.

932
00:53:44.84 --> 00:53:49.36
No, but if you said, hey, my, my name is, you know, frag mob or whatever.

933
00:53:49.36 --> 00:53:53.40
He's made up, you know, your nickname all guys call me that, yeah, I went once

934
00:53:53.40 --> 00:53:57.64
on my hook to grenade and, and it rolled back and, you know, yeah, bus placed.

935
00:53:57.64 --> 00:54:00.76
What if he's not true though, you know, like that would mean problem.

936
00:54:00.76 --> 00:54:05.60
If look, if you hook to grenade in a thing and someone called you frag mob from then on,

937
00:54:05.60 --> 00:54:07.16
then boom, someone gave you that nickname.

938
00:54:07.16 --> 00:54:08.72
But you can't hook a grenade.

939
00:54:08.72 --> 00:54:11.36
It does whatever it is that doesn't be like, what?

940
00:54:11.36 --> 00:54:14.20
I should be called, you know, you can't really do that.

941
00:54:14.20 --> 00:54:15.84
No, you get a lot of nickname yourself.

942
00:54:15.84 --> 00:54:19.28
No, so even if you introduce yourself, if no, no, you introduce yourself, okay, I'm

943
00:54:19.28 --> 00:54:22.64
dragon boy, but I just gave that to name to myself today.

944
00:54:22.64 --> 00:54:26.44
And, but, and they, for sure, they'll call you dragon boy.

945
00:54:26.44 --> 00:54:29.88
But if one person finds out, oh, you just gave yourself that nickname.

946
00:54:29.88 --> 00:54:33.52
Oh, yeah, they're going to be like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, you're somebody else.

947
00:54:33.52 --> 00:54:34.52
Yes, sir.

948
00:54:34.52 --> 00:54:35.52
So how do you do it though?

949
00:54:35.52 --> 00:54:36.52
How do you know?

950
00:54:36.52 --> 00:54:37.76
You know, you just got to let it.

951
00:54:37.76 --> 00:54:38.76
That's what I think is important.

952
00:54:38.76 --> 00:54:41.80
What's important here is that the familiarity isn't a lie.

953
00:54:41.80 --> 00:54:43.24
The familiarity is real.

954
00:54:43.24 --> 00:54:44.08
Yes.

955
00:54:44.08 --> 00:54:45.08
That's the difference.

956
00:54:45.08 --> 00:54:46.08
I know how you do it.

957
00:54:46.08 --> 00:54:48.24
It's not, it's not 100% you.

958
00:54:48.24 --> 00:54:50.84
It's more allowing nicknames to be seen.

959
00:54:50.84 --> 00:54:55.24
You know, like, you know, some people their name, I don't know, for example, hypothetical

960
00:54:55.24 --> 00:54:59.16
example, like, let's say he's like, hey, my name's Jonathan.

961
00:54:59.16 --> 00:55:03.40
And then, you know, in a casual conversation, hey, John, what's up, John?

962
00:55:03.40 --> 00:55:07.20
And then they'll be like, hey, it's like, no disrespect or nothing, but it's Jonathan.

963
00:55:07.20 --> 00:55:09.20
They prefer the whole thing.

964
00:55:09.20 --> 00:55:11.64
Maybe the whole Jonathan more beneficial one.

965
00:55:11.64 --> 00:55:14.08
But like if Hackworth would have said, hey, it's Hackworth.

966
00:55:14.08 --> 00:55:15.08
It's not Hack.

967
00:55:15.08 --> 00:55:17.56
Then he probably wouldn't have had the name Hack.

968
00:55:17.56 --> 00:55:18.56
That's true.

969
00:55:18.56 --> 00:55:22.16
So when someone buss out a nickname for you, you just got to let it fly.

970
00:55:22.16 --> 00:55:24.76
Yeah, well, I'll tell you in the teams when they buss out a nickname for you.

971
00:55:24.76 --> 00:55:26.60
If you protest it, it's going to stick even to the door.

972
00:55:26.60 --> 00:55:27.60
There you go.

973
00:55:27.60 --> 00:55:32.80
So you could essentially in theory fake, actively protest exactly.

974
00:55:32.80 --> 00:55:34.60
But they'd see right through that.

975
00:55:34.60 --> 00:55:35.60
No, right.

976
00:55:35.60 --> 00:55:37.24
You could call that fine.

977
00:55:37.24 --> 00:55:39.24
Yeah, we're different again now.

978
00:55:39.24 --> 00:55:40.24
Check out.

979
00:55:40.24 --> 00:55:41.24
Yeah, guys.

980
00:55:41.24 --> 00:55:42.24
You gotta be quick.

981
00:55:42.24 --> 00:55:44.08
You gotta be sneaky with it, I guess.

982
00:55:44.08 --> 00:55:45.08
All right.

983
00:55:45.08 --> 00:55:46.08
Okay, back to the book.

984
00:55:46.08 --> 00:55:51.60
If a leader neglects the human factor, he will fail.

985
00:55:51.60 --> 00:55:57.44
No man can lead others if he does not know what they are thinking and feeling.

986
00:55:57.44 --> 00:56:05.52
So again, we got Monti here who kind of talks like he's all loofing everything.

987
00:56:05.52 --> 00:56:07.68
But he knows you gotta know your people.

988
00:56:07.68 --> 00:56:09.36
And you gotta understand people.

989
00:56:09.36 --> 00:56:11.48
And then he goes on a little shift here.

990
00:56:11.48 --> 00:56:17.28
No leader, however great can long continue unless he wins victories.

991
00:56:17.28 --> 00:56:21.08
Without victories in battle, all else is useless.

992
00:56:21.08 --> 00:56:24.28
So what then is success in battle?

993
00:56:24.28 --> 00:56:25.44
Do.

994
00:56:25.44 --> 00:56:31.40
In his great study of Marboro, Mr. Winston Churchill says very truly.

995
00:56:31.40 --> 00:56:33.04
And so here's a little quote from Winston Churchill.

996
00:56:33.04 --> 00:56:34.36
And this is interesting.

997
00:56:34.36 --> 00:56:40.84
He's talking about the Duke of Marboro who was another guy in the 1600s that fought

998
00:56:40.84 --> 00:56:44.60
in the war of Spanish succession.

999
00:56:44.60 --> 00:56:48.28
This guy never lost a battle, apparently.

1000
00:56:48.28 --> 00:56:53.96
And interesting, he was the Duke of Marboro, but his actual name was John Churchill.

1001
00:56:53.96 --> 00:56:59.76
And he is actually, I want to say, the great great, maybe great grandfather of Winston Churchill.

1002
00:56:59.76 --> 00:57:03.40
So this is Winston Churchill's bloodline.

1003
00:57:03.40 --> 00:57:07.60
And this is what Winston Churchill says about his great great, however many great grandfathers.

1004
00:57:07.60 --> 00:57:10.52
And I think that's right.

1005
00:57:10.52 --> 00:57:15.92
The successful commander does not arise from following rules or models.

1006
00:57:15.92 --> 00:57:24.92
It consists in an absolutely new comprehension of the dominant facts of the situation at

1007
00:57:24.92 --> 00:57:28.96
a time and all the forces at work.

1008
00:57:28.96 --> 00:57:32.28
Every great operation of war is unique.

1009
00:57:32.28 --> 00:57:37.24
What is wanted is a profound appreciation of the actual event.

1010
00:57:37.24 --> 00:57:43.32
There is no sure road to disaster, then to imitate, imitate the plans of bygone heroes

1011
00:57:43.32 --> 00:57:45.88
and to fit them to novel situations.

1012
00:57:45.88 --> 00:57:48.40
So there you go.

1013
00:57:48.40 --> 00:57:56.44
This ability to absolutely comprehend this new situation and to not try and force, not

1014
00:57:56.44 --> 00:58:04.76
try and force a rule or a model to work for you in a certain situation.

1015
00:58:04.76 --> 00:58:08.28
Back to the book, this indeed is true.

1016
00:58:08.28 --> 00:58:13.08
For in no war, for in war, no two situations are ever the same.

1017
00:58:13.08 --> 00:58:17.12
And each situation must be tackled as a wholly new problem to which there will likely

1018
00:58:17.12 --> 00:58:20.44
be a wholly new answer.

1019
00:58:20.44 --> 00:58:23.68
You need only to look at the beginning of this war.

1020
00:58:23.68 --> 00:58:30.36
And to and to the trust put in the magna line, here indeed was there a failure to appreciate

1021
00:58:30.36 --> 00:58:36.60
the new and change technique which had risen and one which rendered such fortifications

1022
00:58:36.60 --> 00:58:40.08
in themselves wholly useless.

1023
00:58:40.08 --> 00:58:46.24
The wind victories certain qualities are necessary and I will mention four which were possessed

1024
00:58:46.24 --> 00:58:50.64
in greater or less by all the great captains of history.

1025
00:58:50.64 --> 00:58:54.76
These are the knowledge of the technique of making war.

1026
00:58:54.76 --> 00:58:59.40
So that's interesting because Churchill just said, look, it's not using this previous knowledge.

1027
00:58:59.40 --> 00:59:00.68
You got to be able to apply it.

1028
00:59:00.68 --> 00:59:02.24
But at the same time, guess what?

1029
00:59:02.24 --> 00:59:06.28
You've got to have the knowledge of the technique of making war.

1030
00:59:06.28 --> 00:59:10.52
Next, the ability to see clearly the few essentials that are important to success.

1031
00:59:10.52 --> 00:59:19.96
Next, courage and mental robustness in lastly a well-balanced judgment.

1032
00:59:19.96 --> 00:59:22.44
He kind of goes through these in a little bit more detail.

1033
00:59:22.44 --> 00:59:28.80
Now, the manner in which war is waged varies from age to age and with the advent of each

1034
00:59:28.80 --> 00:59:30.12
new weapon.

1035
00:59:30.12 --> 00:59:33.64
It is a constantly changing, constantly evolving thing.

1036
00:59:33.64 --> 00:59:37.68
See who aspires to high command and war must thoroughly understand the main principles

1037
00:59:37.68 --> 00:59:42.28
which will dictate the manner in which the battle of his age will be fought.

1038
00:59:42.28 --> 00:59:47.16
He also must be constantly on the watch for new ideas or weapons which will affect those

1039
00:59:47.16 --> 00:59:48.80
principles.

1040
00:59:48.80 --> 00:59:53.44
The speed of change in military science during time of peace is often slow and many have

1041
00:59:53.44 --> 00:59:58.44
consequently allowed themselves to be lulled into false sense of security which has been

1042
00:59:58.44 --> 01:00:02.000
rudely shattered on the outbreak of war.

1043
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.76
So guess what, you've got to have a open mind and you've got to pay attention.

1044
01:00:08.76 --> 01:00:13.16
The knowledge of how to make war also implies the ability to train troops.

1045
01:00:13.16 --> 01:00:19.04
Every great commander has himself had to forge his weapon for the task in front of him.

1046
01:00:19.04 --> 01:00:23.52
Moses led the people of Israel for 40 years in the desert teaching them how to fight and

1047
01:00:23.52 --> 01:00:26.48
he forged the weapon to conquer Cainan.

1048
01:00:26.48 --> 01:00:31.52
So also Cromwell and Napoleon, they forged their own weapon for the specific task in

1049
01:00:31.52 --> 01:00:38.24
hand, improvising and inventing as they went along so as to develop new tactics to deal

1050
01:00:38.24 --> 01:00:45.76
with the new problems with which in their day they were faced.

1051
01:00:45.76 --> 01:00:52.48
So you've got to study war, you've got to understand how to train your troops, continuing

1052
01:00:52.48 --> 01:00:57.84
on, no man can be a great military leader unless he has the ability to cut through

1053
01:00:57.84 --> 01:01:05.28
overlying difficulties and to see clearly the few essentials in any problem which is faced.

1054
01:01:05.28 --> 01:01:12.56
In any problem there are never more than a few essentials which are vital to that problem.

1055
01:01:12.56 --> 01:01:15.60
That's a pretty bold statement and it's also pretty true.

1056
01:01:15.60 --> 01:01:19.72
You get these big problems, guess what, there's only a few things that are truly essential.

1057
01:01:19.72 --> 01:01:24.88
Now, as you solve the first couple of essential ones there's going to be the next essential

1058
01:01:24.88 --> 01:01:25.88
problem.

1059
01:01:25.88 --> 01:01:26.88
This is prioritized next.

1060
01:01:26.88 --> 01:01:28.40
And simple to write.

1061
01:01:28.40 --> 01:01:29.40
And simple to write.

1062
01:01:29.40 --> 01:01:32.72
They're both wrapped together in this thought.

1063
01:01:32.72 --> 01:01:38.80
These must be grasped out of the massive details and must never be lost sight of.

1064
01:01:38.80 --> 01:01:43.44
If in battle a commander loses sight of the few essentials that matter he will suffer

1065
01:01:43.44 --> 01:01:44.44
defeat.

1066
01:01:44.44 --> 01:01:50.56
So when you're getting distracted by these other things you're going to end up losing.

1067
01:01:50.56 --> 01:01:56.64
But to see the essentials clearly he must not himself get too immersed in detail.

1068
01:01:56.64 --> 01:02:01.12
Every great commander has had a chief of staff whose main task was the mastery of detail.

1069
01:02:01.12 --> 01:02:05.72
Thus leaving his master free to tackle essentials of the problem together with those details.

1070
01:02:05.72 --> 01:02:08.56
And only those details which were vital that problem.

1071
01:02:08.56 --> 01:02:09.56
Boom.

1072
01:02:09.56 --> 01:02:11.24
That's it.

1073
01:02:11.24 --> 01:02:13.04
You cannot get in the weeds.

1074
01:02:13.04 --> 01:02:14.44
You cannot micromanage.

1075
01:02:14.44 --> 01:02:18.04
You cannot look at a plan all day and expect that you're going to see something that your

1076
01:02:18.04 --> 01:02:19.48
troops didn't see who are doing the planning.

1077
01:02:19.48 --> 01:02:20.48
You need to step back.

1078
01:02:20.48 --> 01:02:24.24
You need to elevate yourself.

1079
01:02:24.24 --> 01:02:29.000
For though there is much detail in which the for though there is much detail with which a

1080
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.44
commander cannot and must not bother himself is interesting to note that every great commander

1081
01:02:34.44 --> 01:02:40.56
has always concerned himself with certain of the details of his problems.

1082
01:02:40.56 --> 01:02:44.40
Napoleon and Wellington are two good cases in point.

1083
01:02:44.40 --> 01:02:50.44
No man can rise to a high command who is not the quality of courage.

1084
01:02:50.44 --> 01:02:57.48
The highest form of personal courage is required rather in the leader at the lower level.

1085
01:02:57.48 --> 01:03:01.20
Who has to plunge into the turmoil of the battlefield.

1086
01:03:01.20 --> 01:03:04.52
So yeah, if you're in the front line troops, you need even more courage.

1087
01:03:04.52 --> 01:03:09.12
The leader at the higher levels has to develop his quality of courage into a mental robustness

1088
01:03:09.12 --> 01:03:16.80
which can withstand the mental stress and strain with which he will be assailed.

1089
01:03:16.80 --> 01:03:23.48
He must at all times he must be able at all times to take a dispassionate view of the

1090
01:03:23.48 --> 01:03:28.08
good and bad fortune which will assail him.

1091
01:03:28.08 --> 01:03:31.20
Read that one again.

1092
01:03:31.20 --> 01:03:38.04
He must be able at all times to take a dispassionate view of the good and bad fortune which

1093
01:03:38.04 --> 01:03:39.36
will assail him.

1094
01:03:39.36 --> 01:03:41.24
So okay, bad things are going to happen.

1095
01:03:41.24 --> 01:03:42.64
Good things are going to happen.

1096
01:03:42.64 --> 01:03:45.68
Don't get all excited when some you can get all excited.

1097
01:03:45.68 --> 01:03:46.68
You got to be dispassionate.

1098
01:03:46.68 --> 01:03:50.68
You can't let your emotions start getting crazy.

1099
01:03:50.68 --> 01:03:52.68
You have to detach.

1100
01:03:52.68 --> 01:03:57.76
He must not allow himself to be distracted by events or to be led astray from his main

1101
01:03:57.76 --> 01:04:02.28
purpose by some glittering prize.

1102
01:04:02.28 --> 01:04:07.12
He must at all times maintain an unbiased view of the situation and in battle he must

1103
01:04:07.12 --> 01:04:12.68
be able to judge the true value of the mass of good and bad tidings which will flow upon

1104
01:04:12.68 --> 01:04:14.68
him.

1105
01:04:14.68 --> 01:04:18.68
Stay detached, stay level headed.

1106
01:04:18.68 --> 01:04:19.68
Go to the bad.

1107
01:04:19.68 --> 01:04:23.32
Is that kind of like one like, you know how you get the husband or the boyfriend or

1108
01:04:23.32 --> 01:04:25.72
whatever that like, you know, does something bad?

1109
01:04:25.72 --> 01:04:27.72
I don't know.

1110
01:04:27.72 --> 01:04:28.72
Flair's with a girl.

1111
01:04:28.72 --> 01:04:29.72
There's something like that.

1112
01:04:29.72 --> 01:04:31.72
Girl, girlfriends all mad.

1113
01:04:31.72 --> 01:04:36.72
And then so the guy goes and buys or like a necklace to say sorry.

1114
01:04:36.72 --> 01:04:38.000
It's like that, right?

1115
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.40
Where don't get all caught up in the glittery stuff because, you know, no, that's not

1116
01:04:44.40 --> 01:04:45.40
a thing.

1117
01:04:45.40 --> 01:04:47.40
This is like this.

1118
01:04:47.40 --> 01:04:50.40
Echoes saving up to buy a house.

1119
01:04:50.40 --> 01:04:51.40
Yeah.

1120
01:04:51.40 --> 01:04:55.16
And he's saving up and he's like, okay, I saved, you know, 800 bucks last month.

1121
01:04:55.16 --> 01:04:56.44
I'm going to save 1200 bucks this month.

1122
01:04:56.44 --> 01:04:58.40
I'm going to save 900 bucks this month.

1123
01:04:58.40 --> 01:05:02.40
And all of a sudden you see a new car with rims.

1124
01:05:02.40 --> 01:05:05.40
And with has rims.

1125
01:05:05.40 --> 01:05:06.40
And you can get it.

1126
01:05:06.40 --> 01:05:08.40
You can lease it.

1127
01:05:08.40 --> 01:05:14.24
And all you need to lease it is, you know, $4,000.

1128
01:05:14.24 --> 01:05:15.24
And you're like, no, what?

1129
01:05:15.24 --> 01:05:17.56
How many go get that?

1130
01:05:17.56 --> 01:05:18.56
That's the shiny new thing.

1131
01:05:18.56 --> 01:05:20.56
They just took you off your main goal.

1132
01:05:20.56 --> 01:05:21.56
Yes.

1133
01:05:21.56 --> 01:05:23.000
That's nothing to do with flirting girl friends.

1134
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.76
Well, buy a necklace this is a problem.

1135
01:05:25.76 --> 01:05:28.24
Well, I think yours is a better example for her.

1136
01:05:28.24 --> 01:05:29.24
I think so.

1137
01:05:29.24 --> 01:05:30.64
Yours wasn't even an example.

1138
01:05:30.64 --> 01:05:31.64
You missed the point.

1139
01:05:31.64 --> 01:05:32.64
Okay.

1140
01:05:32.64 --> 01:05:33.64
Yeah.

1141
01:05:33.64 --> 01:05:35.64
I'm trying to think of where it would be.

1142
01:05:35.64 --> 01:05:36.64
Oh, yeah.

1143
01:05:36.64 --> 01:05:40.64
I mean, so if we're going to talk like a girl that was saving for a house.

1144
01:05:40.64 --> 01:05:41.88
And then she's all cool necklace.

1145
01:05:41.88 --> 01:05:43.36
That would have been a good example.

1146
01:05:43.36 --> 01:05:45.84
But the flirting girl with the distraction from the boyfriend.

1147
01:05:45.84 --> 01:05:46.84
No, that's all.

1148
01:05:46.84 --> 01:05:49.96
Well, I mean, here's how I would try to connect the dots on that one.

1149
01:05:49.96 --> 01:05:50.96
Right.

1150
01:05:50.96 --> 01:05:54.12
You know, the girl's like, hey, her mission is to evaluate whether or not this is a good

1151
01:05:54.12 --> 01:05:55.80
boyfriend straight up.

1152
01:05:55.80 --> 01:05:59.32
And then so the boyfriend, he does some stuff that's fundamentally bad.

1153
01:05:59.32 --> 01:06:00.32
Cheats on her.

1154
01:06:00.32 --> 01:06:01.56
I don't know, whatever.

1155
01:06:01.56 --> 01:06:03.92
And then, you know, so she's sort of on that mission.

1156
01:06:03.92 --> 01:06:05.32
She's sort of making the evaluation.

1157
01:06:05.32 --> 01:06:08.08
Then boom, she gets distracted by the sparkly necklace.

1158
01:06:08.08 --> 01:06:09.72
Boom, she goes back to him, blah, blah, blah.

1159
01:06:09.72 --> 01:06:11.68
So I'm saying, no, still bad.

1160
01:06:11.68 --> 01:06:13.72
Not quite, not quite.

1161
01:06:13.72 --> 01:06:20.64
I mean, I get, get after moving on.

1162
01:06:20.64 --> 01:06:26.08
Every battle resolves itself into a toss-al-between the wheels of the two opposing commanders.

1163
01:06:26.08 --> 01:06:32.36
Unless he is mentally robust, a commander will not be able to force his will on his opponent.

1164
01:06:32.36 --> 01:06:37.56
It is well for a commander to remember that no battle was ever lost until the commander thought

1165
01:06:37.56 --> 01:06:38.56
it.

1166
01:06:38.56 --> 01:06:39.56
So.

1167
01:06:39.56 --> 01:06:53.000
A commander must have a well-balanced judgment against two balance of the economies here.

1168
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.16
Both from the battle situation and in his dealings with his subordinates, this is straight

1169
01:06:58.16 --> 01:07:00.08
up, the economy of leadership.

1170
01:07:00.08 --> 01:07:05.36
He must, okay, now he must see the battle situation as constantly shifting interplay

1171
01:07:05.36 --> 01:07:11.16
of forces and he must instinctively know when to be rash and when to be cautious.

1172
01:07:11.16 --> 01:07:13.60
Boom, gotta be balanced.

1173
01:07:13.60 --> 01:07:19.96
He must weigh up the situation both at the moment and as it may develop in the future

1174
01:07:19.96 --> 01:07:26.72
and he must so fight his battle that the enemies reactions cannot upset his plan.

1175
01:07:26.72 --> 01:07:31.36
And although he is trying to force his will on his opponent, a commander must know when

1176
01:07:31.36 --> 01:07:37.60
discretion is the better part of Valor, his desire to dominate his opponent must not

1177
01:07:37.60 --> 01:07:42.68
outweigh his judgment of the actual possibilities of the situation.

1178
01:07:42.68 --> 01:07:43.68
Yes.

1179
01:07:43.68 --> 01:07:46.84
You gotta be aggressive, but you can't be foolhardy.

1180
01:07:46.84 --> 01:07:47.84
That's what we're saying here.

1181
01:07:47.84 --> 01:07:49.80
This is the dichotomy of leadership.

1182
01:07:49.80 --> 01:07:54.88
His judgment must always be well balanced and if it is so and if he has good information

1183
01:07:54.88 --> 01:08:00.16
on which to base it, he can so force the battle his way that the enemy will be forced

1184
01:08:00.16 --> 01:08:02.24
to conform.

1185
01:08:02.24 --> 01:08:08.24
He will, in fact, have rested the initiative from the enemy.

1186
01:08:08.24 --> 01:08:13.40
In his dealings with his subordinates, he will also require good judgment and sound knowledge

1187
01:08:13.40 --> 01:08:14.40
of human nature.

1188
01:08:14.40 --> 01:08:16.76
He must choose his subordinates well.

1189
01:08:16.76 --> 01:08:22.88
Those with whom he is in frequent contact, his senior generals must know personally.

1190
01:08:22.88 --> 01:08:24.44
He must know personally and well.

1191
01:08:24.44 --> 01:08:29.88
He must be able to judge when to drive and when to persuade, when to be stern, when to

1192
01:08:29.88 --> 01:08:36.76
give praise for all men are different and each requires handling in a different way.

1193
01:08:36.76 --> 01:08:38.92
So right there, he just talked about the dichotomy leadership.

1194
01:08:38.92 --> 01:08:43.92
When to drive and when to persuade, when to be stern, when to be give praise, got a balance

1195
01:08:43.92 --> 01:08:45.40
of those dichotomies.

1196
01:08:45.40 --> 01:08:50.48
The three leaders whom I have considered, considered, succeeded so long as they kept

1197
01:08:50.48 --> 01:08:54.44
in their mind their clear military purpose and were not deflected from it by any other

1198
01:08:54.44 --> 01:08:55.44
considerations.

1199
01:08:55.44 --> 01:09:00.04
But there is always the danger that other and especially political considerations will

1200
01:09:00.04 --> 01:09:05.28
be forced, will force the hand of the soldier and lead into some action which is militarily

1201
01:09:05.28 --> 01:09:07.56
unwise.

1202
01:09:07.56 --> 01:09:12.48
Many battles have been fought for political and not for military reasons and these have

1203
01:09:12.48 --> 01:09:17.44
been the graveyard of many soldiers reputation.

1204
01:09:17.44 --> 01:09:23.36
The soldier is the servant of the statesman and is therefore bound to be subject to political

1205
01:09:23.36 --> 01:09:27.80
pressure.

1206
01:09:27.80 --> 01:09:36.32
When every conflict with his clear military purpose, a few statesman will force the hand of

1207
01:09:36.32 --> 01:09:37.32
the soldier.

1208
01:09:37.32 --> 01:09:42.32
If the soldier very bluntly says, if I fight as you wish me to fight, I shall lose the

1209
01:09:42.32 --> 01:09:43.52
battle.

1210
01:09:43.52 --> 01:09:48.84
If I fight in my own way and in my own time, I shall win the battle.

1211
01:09:48.84 --> 01:09:49.84
So there you go.

1212
01:09:49.84 --> 01:09:50.84
That's what you got to do.

1213
01:09:50.84 --> 01:09:54.64
You got to call it like you see it.

1214
01:09:54.64 --> 01:09:59.08
But the soldier must be prepared to be very blunt and he must be prepared to stake its whole

1215
01:09:59.08 --> 01:10:04.12
reputation on successive given adequate resources and a free hand.

1216
01:10:04.12 --> 01:10:08.76
And he also must be prepared to be very firm and to refuse to be forced to do something

1217
01:10:08.76 --> 01:10:13.36
which he considers is not capable of being done.

1218
01:10:13.36 --> 01:10:14.36
So there you have it.

1219
01:10:14.36 --> 01:10:19.04
If you don't think something can be done, it's your moral obligation to say no.

1220
01:10:19.04 --> 01:10:23.12
And of course you have to weigh that with the fact that if you don't do it, someone

1221
01:10:23.12 --> 01:10:26.40
melts might and they might cause even more damage.

1222
01:10:26.40 --> 01:10:28.72
So you have to weigh that.

1223
01:10:28.72 --> 01:10:34.000
That conundrum.

1224
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.24
Back to the book, in history, the military leaders frequently been tempted and has frequently

1225
01:10:38.24 --> 01:10:43.36
succumbed to the temptation to aspire to political leadership.

1226
01:10:43.36 --> 01:10:49.20
The whole training and experience of the soldier makes him less rather than more fitted to be

1227
01:10:49.20 --> 01:10:50.20
a politician.

1228
01:10:50.20 --> 01:10:53.08
So this is an interesting contrast.

1229
01:10:53.08 --> 01:10:58.72
The soldier is trained to stake direct action down certain well-defined lines and has

1230
01:10:58.72 --> 01:11:04.36
in his hand a military machine which responds immediately and with precision to his touch.

1231
01:11:04.36 --> 01:11:09.48
The politician is trained in subtlety and debate, in weighing up the conflicting interests

1232
01:11:09.48 --> 01:11:12.16
of his supporters and usually has to compromise.

1233
01:11:12.16 --> 01:11:17.60
The governmental machine is much less precise and exact than the military and is not as rapid

1234
01:11:17.60 --> 01:11:23.12
in action even in highly skilled political hands.

1235
01:11:23.12 --> 01:11:28.96
Now in war if Commander compromises on essentials, he fails.

1236
01:11:28.96 --> 01:11:33.76
Furthermore, the time factor forces the commander in the field to adopt the best expedient

1237
01:11:33.76 --> 01:11:37.28
in the time available, which is usually short.

1238
01:11:37.28 --> 01:11:41.36
The politician on the other hand is seldom forced to give an immediate decision rather he

1239
01:11:41.36 --> 01:11:47.20
delays in order to find out the right to an accurate answer and he avoids an temporary

1240
01:11:47.20 --> 01:11:49.64
expedient.

1241
01:11:49.64 --> 01:11:54.84
One sees his time by the forelock and adopts the best expedient.

1242
01:11:54.84 --> 01:12:00.48
The other procrastinates in order to ensure that what he does is exactly right.

1243
01:12:00.48 --> 01:12:06.92
Now I think the skits take into the extreme in both cases because you actually even as a military

1244
01:12:06.92 --> 01:12:11.16
leader you want to weigh and make sure you want to wait long enough to make sure you

1245
01:12:11.16 --> 01:12:13.48
are making a good decision.

1246
01:12:13.48 --> 01:12:17.04
And I think in the political world they go to the extreme of they're just going to never

1247
01:12:17.04 --> 01:12:18.04
make a decision.

1248
01:12:18.04 --> 01:12:21.40
Never going to make a change.

1249
01:12:21.40 --> 01:12:25.32
Therefore leader who is primarily a soldier when he metals with politics loses his

1250
01:12:25.32 --> 01:12:27.84
clear and simple military purpose.

1251
01:12:27.84 --> 01:12:29.64
He no longer sees the essentials.

1252
01:12:29.64 --> 01:12:32.24
He is at sea in a political world.

1253
01:12:32.24 --> 01:12:37.16
We read that Kromwell in politics was muddled and perplexed, working slowly and

1254
01:12:37.16 --> 01:12:42.60
deviously to a policy which he did not clearly see.

1255
01:12:42.60 --> 01:12:45.76
And again that he was confused and distracted.

1256
01:12:45.76 --> 01:12:49.76
So though he kept the political power in his own hands during his lifetime much of what

1257
01:12:49.76 --> 01:12:52.52
he built fell to pieces the moment he died.

1258
01:12:52.52 --> 01:12:54.16
So also Napoleon.

1259
01:12:54.16 --> 01:12:59.04
As long as his military purpose was up or most in his mind he succeeded but when political

1260
01:12:59.04 --> 01:13:03.84
considerations dominated his policy the desire to impose his will on Europe led him

1261
01:13:03.84 --> 01:13:10.72
to undertake military operations which it was beyond his power to achieve.

1262
01:13:10.72 --> 01:13:16.76
The qualities required by a soldier and by a politician are in fact almost at opposite

1263
01:13:16.76 --> 01:13:22.16
polls and only a few men in history have possessed both kinds of qualities.

1264
01:13:22.16 --> 01:13:25.44
There have not been many soldiers who have made good political politicians.

1265
01:13:25.44 --> 01:13:28.68
Normandy politicians who have made great soldiers.

1266
01:13:28.68 --> 01:13:35.04
Now the only thing I'll say is that being in the military is very political and you

1267
01:13:35.04 --> 01:13:39.48
even in this time I'm not going to make any distinction that oh it's more political now.

1268
01:13:39.48 --> 01:13:43.000
It's not the old books about World War II.

1269
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.92
It's all kinds of politics going on inside the chain of command.

1270
01:13:46.92 --> 01:13:55.12
So I'm not sure why he, I'm not sure why he sees that great distinction between you

1271
01:13:55.12 --> 01:13:58.44
know they're being no like there's no political things.

1272
01:13:58.44 --> 01:14:01.68
No political games being played in the military.

1273
01:14:01.68 --> 01:14:07.28
There certainly is certainly is and there always has been and there always will be it's

1274
01:14:07.28 --> 01:14:10.48
a group of people and people are going to do the political maneuvers.

1275
01:14:10.48 --> 01:14:12.20
They're going to look out for themselves.

1276
01:14:12.20 --> 01:14:13.76
They're going to try and make this happen.

1277
01:14:13.76 --> 01:14:16.76
That's they're going to have an agenda.

1278
01:14:16.76 --> 01:14:22.12
You got to learn how to negotiate those politics whether you're in the military or whether

1279
01:14:22.12 --> 01:14:26.08
you're in the civilian sector doesn't matter.

1280
01:14:26.08 --> 01:14:30.52
Before we leave the past it is I think interesting to note that great military leaders

1281
01:14:30.52 --> 01:14:32.72
have on the whole been few.

1282
01:14:32.72 --> 01:14:39.76
There have been many generals of good average ability but few who were really great.

1283
01:14:39.76 --> 01:14:44.04
In the study of those who are great it is interesting to note two things first it required

1284
01:14:44.04 --> 01:14:46.16
a war to produce them.

1285
01:14:46.16 --> 01:14:52.08
Second that a number of them prove their greatness after a very short apprenticeship.

1286
01:14:52.08 --> 01:14:59.48
The suggests that the art of war at any rate in the past though less so now is a relatively

1287
01:14:59.48 --> 01:15:06.28
simple art and that the qualities which make a great commander are inherent rather than

1288
01:15:06.28 --> 01:15:07.28
acquired.

1289
01:15:07.28 --> 01:15:08.28
Interesting.

1290
01:15:08.28 --> 01:15:11.68
He's a little bit more saying hey you've kind of born with it.

1291
01:15:11.68 --> 01:15:16.72
The character and more especially the will to dominate and lead his fellow men is given

1292
01:15:16.72 --> 01:15:18.12
to few.

1293
01:15:18.12 --> 01:15:23.88
Given that power to lead the ability to gain success in war can be acquired so you can

1294
01:15:23.88 --> 01:15:27.32
get better at it.

1295
01:15:27.32 --> 01:15:32.20
A man may cultivate the qualities of a great leader provided that he hasn't inherited him

1296
01:15:32.20 --> 01:15:37.40
insufficient degree the character and the will to dominate.

1297
01:15:37.40 --> 01:15:41.96
But unless he has those inherent characteristics he will never become a great leader however

1298
01:15:41.96 --> 01:15:46.44
long he studies the art or the craft of war.

1299
01:15:46.44 --> 01:15:52.56
He is one of the phenomena of military history that events invariably produce the man.

1300
01:15:52.56 --> 01:15:54.80
Age has little or nothing to do with it.

1301
01:15:54.80 --> 01:15:59.36
The opportunity may come sooner to some later to others Napoleon was twenty-sevenly conquered

1302
01:15:59.36 --> 01:16:00.36
Northern Italy.

1303
01:16:00.36 --> 01:16:04.76
Wolf was thirty-four when he captured a Quebec at the end of the other end of the scale

1304
01:16:04.76 --> 01:16:09.44
marble was fifty-two when he first rose to a high and independent command.

1305
01:16:09.44 --> 01:16:15.72
An abracrompy conducted a short but brilliant campaign in Egypt at the age of sixty-eight.

1306
01:16:15.72 --> 01:16:17.88
At the end of a long lifetime.

1307
01:16:17.88 --> 01:16:22.72
In the careers of great generals there has always been this aspect of chance.

1308
01:16:22.72 --> 01:16:26.60
Opportunity comes at different ages and in different circumstances some have been lucky

1309
01:16:26.60 --> 01:16:27.76
or than others.

1310
01:16:27.76 --> 01:16:33.84
Some perhaps never had the opportunity to prove their ability.

1311
01:16:33.84 --> 01:16:36.84
So that's where he wraps up so much for the lessons of history.

1312
01:16:36.84 --> 01:16:41.84
Today the problems of military leadership are much the same as they always have been.

1313
01:16:41.84 --> 01:16:47.12
I propose to tell you now some of the things that have guided me in leading armies which

1314
01:16:47.12 --> 01:16:49.20
have been entrusted to my command.

1315
01:16:49.20 --> 01:16:55.92
I would say first that a leader must very clearly know what he wants himself.

1316
01:16:55.92 --> 01:17:01.68
He must see his objective clearly and must go all out for it.

1317
01:17:01.68 --> 01:17:08.52
He must let everyone else know what he wants and what are the basic fundamentals of his

1318
01:17:08.52 --> 01:17:13.88
policy. He must in fact give firm guidance and a clear lead.

1319
01:17:13.88 --> 01:17:17.56
It will be necessary for him to create what I call atmosphere.

1320
01:17:17.56 --> 01:17:21.16
And in that atmosphere his subordinate commanders and troops will live and work.

1321
01:17:21.16 --> 01:17:26.08
To do this he will have to take a very firm grip on his military machine from the top.

1322
01:17:26.08 --> 01:17:29.84
Only in this way will his force acquire balance and cohesion.

1323
01:17:29.84 --> 01:17:33.08
And so develop its full fighting potential.

1324
01:17:33.08 --> 01:17:38.60
History has many examples of a lack of grip being taken by a commander with the result

1325
01:17:38.60 --> 01:17:44.88
that he failed to develop the power of which his force was capable and so met disaster.

1326
01:17:44.88 --> 01:17:46.88
So this is Monti.

1327
01:17:46.88 --> 01:17:50.56
You got to take that firm grip.

1328
01:17:50.56 --> 01:17:54.20
And again it's very strange because he comes off so strong like that.

1329
01:17:54.20 --> 01:17:55.88
But here we go.

1330
01:17:55.88 --> 01:17:57.32
He's going to counter it right here.

1331
01:17:57.32 --> 01:18:02.12
Having laid down the basic fundamentals of his policy, a commander must complete

1332
01:18:02.12 --> 01:18:08.44
trust in his subordinates and must give them freedom to carry out that policy within the

1333
01:18:08.44 --> 01:18:11.56
framework which he has laid down.

1334
01:18:11.56 --> 01:18:15.08
So this is decentralized command.

1335
01:18:15.08 --> 01:18:20.08
He must be prepared to decentralize and to trust his subordinates to use their own initiative

1336
01:18:20.08 --> 01:18:22.08
on all matters of detail.

1337
01:18:22.08 --> 01:18:25.72
Everyone listen to that.

1338
01:18:25.72 --> 01:18:26.88
Don't worry about the details.

1339
01:18:26.88 --> 01:18:30.96
The commander himself must stand back from the detail so we can see clearly the essentials

1340
01:18:30.96 --> 01:18:36.56
of his problem and make sure that the correct action is being taken on those essentials.

1341
01:18:36.56 --> 01:18:40.48
If ever a commander allows himself to become too greatly immersed in the unimportant details

1342
01:18:40.48 --> 01:18:44.96
of any problem, he will fail to see the essentials clearly.

1343
01:18:44.96 --> 01:18:47.52
Detach, take a step back.

1344
01:18:47.52 --> 01:18:49.20
Elevate yourself.

1345
01:18:49.20 --> 01:18:54.24
It is obvious that he must be a good judge of men and a good chooser of subordinates.

1346
01:18:54.24 --> 01:19:00.000
He must also have the drive to get things done.

1347
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.52
No commander will long remain in the first rank unless he achieves success.

1348
01:19:04.52 --> 01:19:09.88
The biggest single factor for making success in war is morale.

1349
01:19:09.88 --> 01:19:15.56
A high morale is based on discipline, self respect and the confidence of the soldier in his

1350
01:19:15.56 --> 01:19:17.60
commanders and his weapons.

1351
01:19:17.60 --> 01:19:25.40
It is a pearl of very great price and without it no success in battle will be achieved.

1352
01:19:25.40 --> 01:19:31.52
A high morale is in fact a measure of the confidence of troops of their commander.

1353
01:19:31.52 --> 01:19:34.48
That is an interesting point.

1354
01:19:34.48 --> 01:19:35.96
How do you have high morale?

1355
01:19:35.96 --> 01:19:39.20
It is a measurement of how confident the troops are.

1356
01:19:39.20 --> 01:19:46.64
When the troops are confident or the employees are confident in the boss morale is high.

1357
01:19:46.64 --> 01:19:50.04
When they are not confident morale is low.

1358
01:19:50.04 --> 01:19:56.84
By the way, with low morale, you are not winning.

1359
01:19:56.84 --> 01:20:01.72
Continuing on, there is no book of rules which will help a commander to gain the complete

1360
01:20:01.72 --> 01:20:04.36
trust and confidence of his men.

1361
01:20:04.36 --> 01:20:10.48
Each commander will adopt his own methods and say the ones best suited to his own personality.

1362
01:20:10.48 --> 01:20:15.28
Suffice it to say that he must be known, must be known personally to them.

1363
01:20:15.28 --> 01:20:20.04
And that success in battle will produce quick results, all soldiers will follow a successful

1364
01:20:20.04 --> 01:20:21.80
general.

1365
01:20:21.80 --> 01:20:26.80
No commander, however, will gain the confidence of his troops unless he is known and well-known

1366
01:20:26.80 --> 01:20:28.52
to them.

1367
01:20:28.52 --> 01:20:33.16
They must often see him and if possible, hear him speak.

1368
01:20:33.16 --> 01:20:37.20
A commander should take every opportunity of talking to his officers and men, it will

1369
01:20:37.20 --> 01:20:39.44
repay him according to his worth.

1370
01:20:39.44 --> 01:20:44.52
Got to get out there and talk to the troops.

1371
01:20:44.52 --> 01:20:48.40
There are other fractures, also which have a big effect on morale.

1372
01:20:48.40 --> 01:20:57.80
The home front and the battle on the front nowadays has never before very closely linked.

1373
01:20:57.80 --> 01:21:01.84
So you got to keep that morale up and get to make sure everything is going to go to the

1374
01:21:01.84 --> 01:21:04.48
home front and see imagine what it is linked like now.

1375
01:21:04.48 --> 01:21:07.68
I mean, he is talking about World War II.

1376
01:21:07.68 --> 01:21:08.68
World War II.

1377
01:21:08.68 --> 01:21:11.48
Hey, we are very closely linked because I can write a letter that is going to get to my

1378
01:21:11.48 --> 01:21:14.20
wife nine weeks from now.

1379
01:21:14.20 --> 01:21:17.84
And now we got brothers on Facebook Live.

1380
01:21:17.84 --> 01:21:21.44
Nightly.

1381
01:21:21.44 --> 01:21:25.88
Continuing on, just as success is a great stimulus to morale, so nothing lowers morale

1382
01:21:25.88 --> 01:21:28.12
so quickly as failure.

1383
01:21:28.12 --> 01:21:31.20
Therefore there must be no failures.

1384
01:21:31.20 --> 01:21:35.32
Great and lasting harm can be done to morale by undertaking operations for which the

1385
01:21:35.32 --> 01:21:43.72
troops concerned are not ready or trained and which they are likely to end in failure.

1386
01:21:43.72 --> 01:21:48.96
I have therefore made it a rule to limit the scope of any operation to what can be achieved

1387
01:21:48.96 --> 01:21:50.96
successfully.

1388
01:21:50.96 --> 01:21:58.04
So again, this sounds super risk-averse and that's that is.

1389
01:21:58.04 --> 01:22:01.000
Hey, I'm not going to do anything that I don't know we can achieve it.

1390
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.08
Then again, how often do you want to be rolling the dice?

1391
01:22:05.08 --> 01:22:06.08
Why not say you know what?

1392
01:22:06.08 --> 01:22:07.52
Well, let's give it another month.

1393
01:22:07.52 --> 01:22:08.52
Let's train a little bit more.

1394
01:22:08.52 --> 01:22:11.36
What do we have to do this right now?

1395
01:22:11.36 --> 01:22:16.12
And I certainly think that there's times when you have to take risk and you're going

1396
01:22:16.12 --> 01:22:18.88
to do some things that maybe you don't know if you can get away with.

1397
01:22:18.88 --> 01:22:21.08
And there can be times where you're forced in that position as well.

1398
01:22:21.08 --> 01:22:26.12
Like you're being attacked and hey, I'm not sure if a flank is going to work but we can

1399
01:22:26.12 --> 01:22:30.56
either sit here and get attacked and get flanked by them or we can go and flank ourselves.

1400
01:22:30.56 --> 01:22:32.72
Let's let's go make this happen.

1401
01:22:32.72 --> 01:22:38.28
So I think we need to make sure we don't take that rule that comment to the extreme because

1402
01:22:38.28 --> 01:22:46.20
that can be a bit much but consider it, consider it deeply.

1403
01:22:46.20 --> 01:22:51.40
And I think probably the reason why this is probably one of those points where he said

1404
01:22:51.40 --> 01:22:59.76
in the beginning of this, he made the premise that hey, this is for Army command, right?

1405
01:22:59.76 --> 01:23:01.64
Or at least divisional command.

1406
01:23:01.64 --> 01:23:06.16
We're talking to your in charge of 10,000 people or more.

1407
01:23:06.16 --> 01:23:11.40
You know what he's saying, maybe when I guess it becomes more acceptable of a rule, you

1408
01:23:11.40 --> 01:23:13.52
don't want to risk 10 out.

1409
01:23:13.52 --> 01:23:17.24
You don't want to risk an entire army or an entire division on something that you may

1410
01:23:17.24 --> 01:23:20.000
or may not be successful at, right?

1411
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.88
Maybe we need to reassess if we're not sure we can make this happen, maybe we need to reassess

1412
01:23:23.88 --> 01:23:29.48
if we're going to go forward or not.

1413
01:23:29.48 --> 01:23:36.44
Another thing that today has a big effect on morale is the standard of medical care, which

1414
01:23:36.44 --> 01:23:38.000
soldiers can expect.

1415
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.44
So you got that.

1416
01:23:42.44 --> 01:23:48.48
And then we get to a commander must make a very close study of human nature.

1417
01:23:48.48 --> 01:23:53.48
The raw material with which he has to deal are men.

1418
01:23:53.48 --> 01:23:56.88
And it is important to remember that all men are different.

1419
01:23:56.88 --> 01:24:03.84
What a commander makes of the human material at his disposal will depend entirely on himself.

1420
01:24:03.84 --> 01:24:08.28
I have found that every division, which has fought under my command, has had a different

1421
01:24:08.28 --> 01:24:09.76
characteristics.

1422
01:24:09.76 --> 01:24:12.52
Each division was good at a different type of battle.

1423
01:24:12.52 --> 01:24:17.52
And it is vital that the commander should gauge what type of battle is best at and make

1424
01:24:17.52 --> 01:24:25.92
sure that each division is at the right point when required.

1425
01:24:25.92 --> 01:24:31.16
So even in the quote, uniformity of the military, they have differences.

1426
01:24:31.16 --> 01:24:32.44
They're human beings.

1427
01:24:32.44 --> 01:24:37.20
And those differences are reflected through whole units.

1428
01:24:37.20 --> 01:24:41.08
The difference between divisions is based partly on the individual individuality of the

1429
01:24:41.08 --> 01:24:42.76
commander of the division.

1430
01:24:42.76 --> 01:24:46.12
And partly on the type of men of whom the division is composed.

1431
01:24:46.12 --> 01:24:50.36
I found for instance that some divisions were outstandingly good at the breakthrough attack,

1432
01:24:50.36 --> 01:24:54.52
but were not so good at the deliberate set piece of error.

1433
01:24:54.52 --> 01:24:59.24
Some divisions were best at night, some by day, for a solid killing match, certain types

1434
01:24:59.24 --> 01:25:01.48
of men were better than others.

1435
01:25:01.48 --> 01:25:03.04
And so on.

1436
01:25:03.04 --> 01:25:09.88
Each division develops an individuality of its own, which I consider a high commander, must

1437
01:25:09.88 --> 01:25:12.52
study.

1438
01:25:12.52 --> 01:25:21.48
I was in the airport and I ran into a dude from South Africa who was in the game kind of

1439
01:25:21.48 --> 01:25:24.80
big done.

1440
01:25:24.80 --> 01:25:28.40
He was talking about, he said to Gias, I can't do it.

1441
01:25:28.40 --> 01:25:29.40
They're accent.

1442
01:25:29.40 --> 01:25:36.20
But he was saying that he worked construction, he was a construction guy, and he had

1443
01:25:36.20 --> 01:25:37.20
a crew.

1444
01:25:37.20 --> 01:25:38.84
And he gave his crew a name.

1445
01:25:38.84 --> 01:25:42.12
And I should have asked him what the name of the crew was, but I didn't.

1446
01:25:42.12 --> 01:25:45.08
But I'm sure they gave him some kind of name.

1447
01:25:45.08 --> 01:25:48.48
And he was like, he was just so pumped.

1448
01:25:48.48 --> 01:25:52.20
And he goes, yeah, I read it in Hackworth II, and then I did it.

1449
01:25:52.20 --> 01:25:53.20
Could you did it?

1450
01:25:53.20 --> 01:25:55.96
And he goes, it really worked.

1451
01:25:55.96 --> 01:25:58.40
It was all fired up.

1452
01:25:58.40 --> 01:26:00.84
Because you can change the personality of something.

1453
01:26:00.84 --> 01:26:04.64
You can change the personality of a unit like that.

1454
01:26:04.64 --> 01:26:05.64
You can do it.

1455
01:26:05.64 --> 01:26:10.12
It works.

1456
01:26:10.12 --> 01:26:13.56
In the same way, all generals differ.

1457
01:26:13.56 --> 01:26:15.24
And must be selected for the job.

1458
01:26:15.24 --> 01:26:19.20
And no two jobs, no two problems are ever the same in the character of the job must be

1459
01:26:19.20 --> 01:26:22.96
matched to that of the commander selected to undertake it.

1460
01:26:22.96 --> 01:26:26.24
One of the most important functions of a commander in the war to make sure that he has

1461
01:26:26.24 --> 01:26:30.92
the right man in the right place to tackle the job in hand.

1462
01:26:30.92 --> 01:26:31.92
So think about that.

1463
01:26:31.92 --> 01:26:35.92
When you're in charge of a team, when you're in charge of a business, one of the most

1464
01:26:35.92 --> 01:26:43.80
important things that you do is put the right people in the right job.

1465
01:26:43.80 --> 01:26:47.08
When people are sensitive to that.

1466
01:26:47.08 --> 01:26:50.36
So when I'm like, hey, hey, Bill, I'm not giving you this off.

1467
01:26:50.36 --> 01:26:51.36
I'm giving it to Echo.

1468
01:26:51.36 --> 01:26:55.52
And Bill gets mad and frustrated and he's things to echo doesn't deserve it.

1469
01:26:55.52 --> 01:27:00.12
Man, we got to have a good enough relationship and trust that when I say, hey, Bill, this

1470
01:27:00.12 --> 01:27:01.12
is not for you.

1471
01:27:01.12 --> 01:27:02.12
I'm giving it to Echo.

1472
01:27:02.12 --> 01:27:03.12
And he goes, okay, cool.

1473
01:27:03.12 --> 01:27:04.12
Let me know what's coming down the pile.

1474
01:27:04.12 --> 01:27:05.12
No, I can get ready for it.

1475
01:27:05.12 --> 01:27:06.36
Let me know how I can support.

1476
01:27:06.36 --> 01:27:07.36
Yeah.

1477
01:27:07.36 --> 01:27:08.36
Yeah, that.

1478
01:27:08.36 --> 01:27:10.76
Remember, remember the movie Major League.

1479
01:27:10.76 --> 01:27:11.76
Charlie Sheen, come on.

1480
01:27:11.76 --> 01:27:12.76
Yeah.

1481
01:27:12.76 --> 01:27:16.000
I don't think I ever sat through that whole movie.

1482
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.80
Oh, actually, you know what I think I asked you that before.

1483
01:27:17.80 --> 01:27:18.80
Yeah.

1484
01:27:18.80 --> 01:27:19.80
I think you said the same thing.

1485
01:27:19.80 --> 01:27:20.80
So there's a spark where it's okay.

1486
01:27:20.80 --> 01:27:24.40
So Charlie Sheen, he got his glasses.

1487
01:27:24.40 --> 01:27:25.40
Oh, yeah.

1488
01:27:25.40 --> 01:27:27.08
That's what we were talking about last time.

1489
01:27:27.08 --> 01:27:29.80
So last time, as far as Major League goes, the movie Major League.

1490
01:27:29.80 --> 01:27:34.40
So Charlie Sheen, he had all this crazy power and speed in his fastball.

1491
01:27:34.40 --> 01:27:35.80
But no, no control.

1492
01:27:35.80 --> 01:27:38.000
Then they find out whatever he can't see that good.

1493
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
They give him some glasses.

1494
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.48
Boom, he brings it all together.

1495
01:27:40.48 --> 01:27:41.48
They start winning on this stuff.

1496
01:27:41.48 --> 01:27:43.12
So he's starting.

1497
01:27:43.12 --> 01:27:47.28
The other guy who was starting before him is named Harris, older guy.

1498
01:27:47.28 --> 01:27:49.68
But you know, the basically the more consistent.

1499
01:27:49.68 --> 01:27:53.48
He's not like legit, like Charlie Sheen, but he's consistent.

1500
01:27:53.48 --> 01:27:55.72
So they're about to play the fast-forward.

1501
01:27:55.72 --> 01:27:57.24
They're about to play the gate keys.

1502
01:27:57.24 --> 01:27:59.32
Right, and the big game.

1503
01:27:59.32 --> 01:28:02.32
Or there's that called the word series.

1504
01:28:02.32 --> 01:28:04.84
It's like this big deal.

1505
01:28:04.84 --> 01:28:09.24
And so the general manager, Lill, calls Charlie Sheen.

1506
01:28:09.24 --> 01:28:11.84
Oh, this is name and we'll be Charlie Sheen.

1507
01:28:11.84 --> 01:28:12.84
Doesn't matter.

1508
01:28:12.84 --> 01:28:13.84
Doesn't matter anyway.

1509
01:28:13.84 --> 01:28:17.64
Because it calls Charlie Sheen to the back of the bus and he's like, hey, I'm going to

1510
01:28:17.64 --> 01:28:19.72
start Harris against the Yankees.

1511
01:28:19.72 --> 01:28:24.60
He just has a better reputation against them and more experience, whatever.

1512
01:28:24.60 --> 01:28:28.88
And then Charlie Sheen was like, oh, yeah, whatever is best for the team.

1513
01:28:28.88 --> 01:28:29.88
Any laugh.

1514
01:28:29.88 --> 01:28:31.60
And that's sort of it.

1515
01:28:31.60 --> 01:28:32.60
So he was good with it.

1516
01:28:32.60 --> 01:28:34.24
No, I don't know how the movie goes on.

1517
01:28:34.24 --> 01:28:35.08
And he's not good with it.

1518
01:28:35.08 --> 01:28:37.56
He expressed himself like he was good with it.

1519
01:28:37.56 --> 01:28:42.08
And he said the right things, but later on, he goes on like goes drinking by himself or

1520
01:28:42.08 --> 01:28:43.08
something.

1521
01:28:43.08 --> 01:28:46.12
Then he winds up hooking up with like one of his teammates life.

1522
01:28:46.12 --> 01:28:48.28
And that was all, but that's a whole other story though.

1523
01:28:48.28 --> 01:28:52.64
We don't actually care about any of this, but we definitely care about that.

1524
01:28:52.64 --> 01:28:53.96
Rick, Ron, that's his name.

1525
01:28:53.96 --> 01:28:54.96
Wild thing, Rick, Ron.

1526
01:28:54.96 --> 01:28:55.96
There you go.

1527
01:28:55.96 --> 01:28:57.80
But same deal though, right?

1528
01:28:57.80 --> 01:28:59.80
You got to get the right guy.

1529
01:28:59.80 --> 01:29:00.80
Yeah.

1530
01:29:00.80 --> 01:29:02.08
And of course, you nailed it.

1531
01:29:02.08 --> 01:29:03.08
Yeah, nailed it.

1532
01:29:03.08 --> 01:29:07.48
You eventually, Harris, you know, he does okay.

1533
01:29:07.48 --> 01:29:11.24
And then they bring our Rick fun to fit the clothes out of the game, whatever the win.

1534
01:29:11.24 --> 01:29:12.24
So there you go.

1535
01:29:12.24 --> 01:29:13.24
Boom.

1536
01:29:13.24 --> 01:29:14.24
Win, win.

1537
01:29:14.24 --> 01:29:15.92
Back to the book.

1538
01:29:15.92 --> 01:29:18.04
Back through the book.

1539
01:29:18.04 --> 01:29:24.88
If a commander thinks at all men are the same, and he treats the mass of human material

1540
01:29:24.88 --> 01:29:27.80
accordingly, he will fail.

1541
01:29:27.80 --> 01:29:32.92
The soldiers of today have different standards and require more enlightened handling.

1542
01:29:32.92 --> 01:29:34.92
Then the soldiers of bygone days.

1543
01:29:34.92 --> 01:29:39.32
This is again where he starts to, you realize that this guy, even though he tries to come

1544
01:29:39.32 --> 01:29:46.32
across all hard, he's actually very thoughtful about understanding humans back to the book.

1545
01:29:46.32 --> 01:29:53.24
They will no longer follow blindly and unquestionably to an unknown end.

1546
01:29:53.24 --> 01:29:59.24
Today, therefore, a commander must ensure that his troops always know what they are being

1547
01:29:59.24 --> 01:30:03.56
asked to do and how that fits in with the larger plan.

1548
01:30:03.56 --> 01:30:07.88
I have always, in other words, they got no why they're doing what they're doing.

1549
01:30:07.88 --> 01:30:12.000
I've always insisted that before a battle be essentials of the plan are known right through

1550
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.28
the chain of command and finally down to the rank and file.

1551
01:30:15.28 --> 01:30:18.80
The troops must know how a commander is going to fight the battle and what part they are

1552
01:30:18.80 --> 01:30:19.96
going to plan it.

1553
01:30:19.96 --> 01:30:27.80
This must be explained to them by word of mouth for that counts far more than the written word.

1554
01:30:27.80 --> 01:30:32.84
And then when the battle has been won and the troops see that the battle has gone as the commander

1555
01:30:32.84 --> 01:30:36.80
said it would, their confidence in the high command will be very great.

1556
01:30:36.80 --> 01:30:40.56
This confidence is beyond price.

1557
01:30:40.56 --> 01:30:44.08
The problem with that statement is it puts pressure on you to stick to a plan.

1558
01:30:44.08 --> 01:30:46.24
Just get it flat.

1559
01:30:46.24 --> 01:30:49.68
That makes you go, I'm just going to stick with it because I want everyone to think

1560
01:30:49.68 --> 01:30:51.48
that it went the way I wanted it to go.

1561
01:30:51.48 --> 01:30:53.68
No, don't just stick with a plan.

1562
01:30:53.68 --> 01:30:56.36
If it's not working, it's not working.

1563
01:30:56.36 --> 01:30:57.36
Shift.

1564
01:30:57.36 --> 01:31:02.36
A commander must watch carefully his own morale.

1565
01:31:02.36 --> 01:31:07.12
A battle is a contest between the will of two opposing commanders.

1566
01:31:07.12 --> 01:31:13.36
The one whose heart fails when the issue hangs and the balance will lose the battle.

1567
01:31:13.36 --> 01:31:21.000
A commander in fact must throughout radiating confidence in his plan and operations.

1568
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.80
Even though inwardly he may not be too sure of the outcome.

1569
01:31:25.80 --> 01:31:28.24
That's the one of those other things.

1570
01:31:28.24 --> 01:31:30.68
You know, people talk about transparency.

1571
01:31:30.68 --> 01:31:31.68
Sure.

1572
01:31:31.68 --> 01:31:32.68
Right?

1573
01:31:32.68 --> 01:31:33.68
Transparency.

1574
01:31:33.68 --> 01:31:34.68
Oh, guess what?

1575
01:31:34.68 --> 01:31:37.32
And it's like, oh, yeah, there's a book.

1576
01:31:37.32 --> 01:31:39.68
There's all kinds of book about transparency.

1577
01:31:39.68 --> 01:31:40.68
Yeah.

1578
01:31:40.68 --> 01:31:43.28
Like, oh, you got to be fully transparent with everyone.

1579
01:31:43.28 --> 01:31:47.72
No, actually sometimes if I'm a little more nervous about what we're doing and I start

1580
01:31:47.72 --> 01:31:51.12
to show that everyone's going to be nervous about what we're doing.

1581
01:31:51.12 --> 01:31:52.12
Yeah, man.

1582
01:31:52.12 --> 01:31:53.12
And add scene.

1583
01:31:53.12 --> 01:31:57.80
Yeah, they can, and sometimes too, where like, like how you mentioned before,

1584
01:31:57.80 --> 01:31:59.72
like some people can't take the truth, you know?

1585
01:31:59.72 --> 01:32:04.08
So like if there's certain shifts going to be made or certain like rules going to be implemented

1586
01:32:04.08 --> 01:32:10.64
or whatever, you know, like, hey, we're going to move, we're going to demote this or

1587
01:32:10.64 --> 01:32:15.04
we're going to move this person out of this department because he's just he's he's he's

1588
01:32:15.04 --> 01:32:19.56
he stinks or something like he has B.O. and he's irritating everybody, you know, kind

1589
01:32:19.56 --> 01:32:20.56
of thing.

1590
01:32:20.56 --> 01:32:21.56
Okay.

1591
01:32:21.56 --> 01:32:24.16
And he'll be just do just as good a work down here.

1592
01:32:24.16 --> 01:32:25.16
Yeah.

1593
01:32:25.16 --> 01:32:27.84
And where he's by himself exactly right, you know?

1594
01:32:27.84 --> 01:32:31.92
And it's like, hey, and then we're going to shift you over here and he's going to be like,

1595
01:32:31.92 --> 01:32:37.44
cool, like, why, though, like I'm done to do it, but why do you be transparent?

1596
01:32:37.44 --> 01:32:39.24
Maybe maybe not, but you run the room.

1597
01:32:39.24 --> 01:32:40.24
No, you run the room.

1598
01:32:40.24 --> 01:32:41.72
I mean, what we're saying.

1599
01:32:41.72 --> 01:32:43.92
The good thing to do would be like, hey, man.

1600
01:32:43.92 --> 01:32:44.92
Hey, bro.

1601
01:32:44.92 --> 01:32:47.92
Let me ask you something.

1602
01:32:47.92 --> 01:32:52.44
If I had a bugger hanging out on my nose, would you want, would you, would, if you had

1603
01:32:52.44 --> 01:32:55.08
a bugger hanging out on your nose, would you want me to tell you?

1604
01:32:55.08 --> 01:32:57.32
Everyone says, yeah, of course, cool, you stink.

1605
01:32:57.32 --> 01:33:00.52
I actually, you smell that.

1606
01:33:00.52 --> 01:33:01.52
That's good.

1607
01:33:01.52 --> 01:33:03.24
What about stinky geese on the mat?

1608
01:33:03.24 --> 01:33:04.24
Yeah.

1609
01:33:04.24 --> 01:33:05.24
Right?

1610
01:33:05.24 --> 01:33:06.24
Somebody's got to let him know.

1611
01:33:06.24 --> 01:33:07.68
Bro, you got to watch that thing.

1612
01:33:07.68 --> 01:33:09.68
You might need a new geek.

1613
01:33:09.68 --> 01:33:14.12
You know, some people they have this old rady geek, the smell is embedded in those things.

1614
01:33:14.12 --> 01:33:15.68
I had geese like that.

1615
01:33:15.68 --> 01:33:16.68
Yeah.

1616
01:33:16.68 --> 01:33:20.36
Where's like you wash it and then you wash it and you take it out, you put it on for four

1617
01:33:20.36 --> 01:33:21.36
minutes.

1618
01:33:21.36 --> 01:33:22.76
And you go, yeah, I got to throw this thing away.

1619
01:33:22.76 --> 01:33:24.08
This thing stinks.

1620
01:33:24.08 --> 01:33:25.08
Yeah.

1621
01:33:25.08 --> 01:33:27.44
That's true.

1622
01:33:27.44 --> 01:33:28.72
That would be a better way to do it.

1623
01:33:28.72 --> 01:33:32.08
That way, I say, hey, why don't you move to the beginner class?

1624
01:33:32.08 --> 01:33:33.08
Go drill.

1625
01:33:33.08 --> 01:33:34.08
Go drill.

1626
01:33:34.08 --> 01:33:35.08
Go drill.

1627
01:33:35.08 --> 01:33:38.08
Go work with the grappling dummy over there.

1628
01:33:38.08 --> 01:33:39.76
It's like, no, that's not cool.

1629
01:33:39.76 --> 01:33:40.76
You need to tell a brother.

1630
01:33:40.76 --> 01:33:42.76
Hey, man, you stink at it.

1631
01:33:42.76 --> 01:33:44.16
You need to wash your geek.

1632
01:33:44.16 --> 01:33:46.72
Wash your geek immediately.

1633
01:33:46.72 --> 01:33:47.72
Yeah.

1634
01:33:47.72 --> 01:33:53.28
So this is one of those things where if you need to talk to him, right?

1635
01:33:53.28 --> 01:33:56.04
In that situation, you do need to tell the truth.

1636
01:33:56.04 --> 01:34:00.28
You know, you do need to say, listen, man, I don't know what's up with your hygiene.

1637
01:34:00.28 --> 01:34:01.28
Okay.

1638
01:34:01.28 --> 01:34:03.28
But you some work.

1639
01:34:03.28 --> 01:34:08.28
So what if the company is taking this massive financial hit and laughs are coming?

1640
01:34:08.28 --> 01:34:09.84
She's great up.

1641
01:34:09.84 --> 01:34:11.84
You lay off one guy.

1642
01:34:11.84 --> 01:34:13.48
You lay off two guys.

1643
01:34:13.48 --> 01:34:14.48
Do you be transparent?

1644
01:34:14.48 --> 01:34:16.40
Like, hey, guys, we're taking a massive hit.

1645
01:34:16.40 --> 01:34:18.52
We're laid off a bunch of people.

1646
01:34:18.52 --> 01:34:22.88
Well, yeah, in that case, you have to say, listen, this is what's going on.

1647
01:34:22.88 --> 01:34:24.80
This is where we're at.

1648
01:34:24.80 --> 01:34:27.80
And we're going to do our best.

1649
01:34:27.80 --> 01:34:30.88
And the best way we can do this is by buckling down hard and working hard.

1650
01:34:30.88 --> 01:34:32.92
But right now, it's going to be tight.

1651
01:34:32.92 --> 01:34:35.92
Going to go through a tight quarter right now.

1652
01:34:35.92 --> 01:34:37.56
We had to let go of two guys.

1653
01:34:37.56 --> 01:34:39.32
We're going to try and maintain what we got.

1654
01:34:39.32 --> 01:34:41.32
But I can't promise you anything.

1655
01:34:41.32 --> 01:34:42.32
Right?

1656
01:34:42.32 --> 01:34:43.32
Yes.

1657
01:34:43.32 --> 01:34:44.72
Yes, I'm going to be truthful.

1658
01:34:44.72 --> 01:34:46.32
Maybe it is better to be transparent.

1659
01:34:46.32 --> 01:34:48.04
Most of the time it is.

1660
01:34:48.04 --> 01:34:49.04
Most of the time it is.

1661
01:34:49.04 --> 01:34:50.04
What we do?

1662
01:34:50.04 --> 01:34:53.76
It's in this situation.

1663
01:34:53.76 --> 01:35:00.96
What we're talking about is if you lack confidence in what you're doing, or you start

1664
01:35:00.96 --> 01:35:05.04
to reveal that to the internet, it's not good.

1665
01:35:05.04 --> 01:35:11.80
And you know, there's now, let's say, let's say echo, let's say I didn't think you were

1666
01:35:11.80 --> 01:35:16.92
cognitively capable of doing a job at the next level.

1667
01:35:16.92 --> 01:35:21.44
I might not necessarily tell you that because that's something that you can't necessarily

1668
01:35:21.44 --> 01:35:22.44
change.

1669
01:35:22.44 --> 01:35:23.84
You can't go home, take a shower and get smarter.

1670
01:35:23.84 --> 01:35:24.84
Right?

1671
01:35:24.84 --> 01:35:25.84
Does it work that way?

1672
01:35:25.84 --> 01:35:26.84
No, sir.

1673
01:35:26.84 --> 01:35:30.16
You can't put on the odorant and now you're smarter.

1674
01:35:30.16 --> 01:35:31.16
That doesn't work.

1675
01:35:31.16 --> 01:35:37.28
It's smelling bad is not necessarily a bad problem because it's something that can be fixed.

1676
01:35:37.28 --> 01:35:41.76
But if you aren't smarter enough, well, then we have a situation.

1677
01:35:41.76 --> 01:35:46.88
You can't really, I mean, you can study, you can work, but you're not going to get smarter.

1678
01:35:46.88 --> 01:35:51.20
So it might not be a great idea for me to say, well, you know, I decided not to, you're

1679
01:35:51.20 --> 01:35:53.36
not getting promoted, because you're dumb.

1680
01:35:53.36 --> 01:35:54.80
Yeah, he's just a lot smarter.

1681
01:35:54.80 --> 01:35:56.44
Yeah, you know, here's the deal, man.

1682
01:35:56.44 --> 01:35:59.20
Just straight up, you're not that smart, right?

1683
01:35:59.20 --> 01:36:03.44
So I couldn't put you into our Japan, because you're not smart.

1684
01:36:03.44 --> 01:36:08.28
Now that's different than me saying, hey, listen, man, six months ago, if I was like,

1685
01:36:08.28 --> 01:36:11.72
hey, listen, man, you need to start paying attention.

1686
01:36:11.72 --> 01:36:14.52
Because what you're doing right now, if you're going to move up, you've got to really

1687
01:36:14.52 --> 01:36:16.84
know, it's going to take you some extra study.

1688
01:36:16.84 --> 01:36:19.04
And look, I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed.

1689
01:36:19.04 --> 01:36:22.000
And I know I have to work hard at making this stuff happen.

1690
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.36
Do you look at your, do you look at your manuals at all?

1691
01:36:24.36 --> 01:36:25.60
Have you been studying your manuals?

1692
01:36:25.60 --> 01:36:30.04
You need to like dig into your manuals and really know this stuff.

1693
01:36:30.04 --> 01:36:33.48
If you think you're going to get promoted, you're not going to get promoted unless you know

1694
01:36:33.48 --> 01:36:35.32
this stuff like the back of your hand.

1695
01:36:35.32 --> 01:36:36.96
You need to get in the game.

1696
01:36:36.96 --> 01:36:40.52
So if we've already been through that whole thing and you actually got out the manuals

1697
01:36:40.52 --> 01:36:43.48
and you tried and you didn't make anything happen, well, guys, what?

1698
01:36:43.48 --> 01:36:46.04
Hey, man, it's just not that many opportunities at this next up.

1699
01:36:46.04 --> 01:36:51.12
And by the way, I think there's another kind of course of career course that I have thinking

1700
01:36:51.12 --> 01:36:53.24
for you, you know?

1701
01:36:53.24 --> 01:36:55.000
So let's talk about that.

1702
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
You know what I'm saying?

1703
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Yeah, definitely.

1704
01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.84
Something that requires large biceps.

1705
01:36:59.84 --> 01:37:04.04
I think it's going to be your area of expertise.

1706
01:37:04.04 --> 01:37:05.36
Thanks.

1707
01:37:05.36 --> 01:37:06.36
Check.

1708
01:37:06.36 --> 01:37:10.92
Go back to the book.

1709
01:37:10.92 --> 01:37:16.80
In order that he may keep clear of unimportant details and thus have time for the quiet

1710
01:37:16.80 --> 01:37:22.52
thought and reflection, higher commander must work through a chief of staff and thus avoid

1711
01:37:22.52 --> 01:37:26.68
having to deal separately with the heads of all branches.

1712
01:37:26.68 --> 01:37:32.28
So far as I'm aware, the British Army is the only army which is not adopt the chief

1713
01:37:32.28 --> 01:37:33.28
of staff system.

1714
01:37:33.28 --> 01:37:37.68
In my own experience, it is quite possible to it is quite impossible to exercise high

1715
01:37:37.68 --> 01:37:43.16
command successfully in war without it. I have adopted the chief of staff system myself throughout

1716
01:37:43.16 --> 01:37:45.16
this war and could not have succeeded out of us.

1717
01:37:45.16 --> 01:37:48.96
So you're going to have someone that's going to handle things for you.

1718
01:37:48.96 --> 01:37:49.96
Little things.

1719
01:37:49.96 --> 01:37:56.04
You know, I was talked about the senior enlisted guy, you know, a platoon chief or an

1720
01:37:56.04 --> 01:38:00.48
task unit or, you know, a platoon or a company, an army company.

1721
01:38:00.48 --> 01:38:05.08
The senior enlisted guy, I always said was the action arm of the commander.

1722
01:38:05.08 --> 01:38:07.64
So when you need something done, I don't know.

1723
01:38:07.64 --> 01:38:09.24
I don't have time to go do it myself.

1724
01:38:09.24 --> 01:38:12.04
And if I go do do myself, I'll have lost the bigger picture.

1725
01:38:12.04 --> 01:38:16.48
But if I have something critical, you've got the senior enlisted individual that has the

1726
01:38:16.48 --> 01:38:20.32
most tactical experience, has the most authority, the most respect.

1727
01:38:20.32 --> 01:38:24.68
So when you say, hey, chief, that building over there hasn't been cleared yet.

1728
01:38:24.68 --> 01:38:26.36
I don't know what's going on.

1729
01:38:26.36 --> 01:38:31.04
Go clear that thing and you'll say, Roger that or the platoon sergeant or the company

1730
01:38:31.04 --> 01:38:32.04
first sergeant.

1731
01:38:32.04 --> 01:38:36.56
Those guys should have the experience and attack the expertise and then be utilized as the

1732
01:38:36.56 --> 01:38:38.96
action arm that can make things happen.

1733
01:38:38.96 --> 01:38:41.20
Now that's not exactly what a chief for staff of is.

1734
01:38:41.20 --> 01:38:42.64
It's actually quite different.

1735
01:38:42.64 --> 01:38:46.80
But it's similar in the fact that you can't get sucked into the weeds.

1736
01:38:46.80 --> 01:38:52.44
And if you're the commander of a division and you're in the weeds all the time, you don't

1737
01:38:52.44 --> 01:38:54.32
have, you can't see what's happening.

1738
01:38:54.32 --> 01:38:56.000
And it's the same thing in a business.

1739
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.96
If the CEO of the business is running the business daily, he's not looking up and out.

1740
01:39:01.96 --> 01:39:05.72
He's looking down in and that's not going to allow him to make foresee what's coming

1741
01:39:05.72 --> 01:39:07.80
down the pipe in the future.

1742
01:39:07.80 --> 01:39:09.16
And that's pretty much what it says here.

1743
01:39:09.16 --> 01:39:13.28
No officer whose daily life is spent at the consideration of details, who is not time for

1744
01:39:13.28 --> 01:39:18.36
quiet fought and reflection can make a sound plan of battle or conduct large-scale operations.

1745
01:39:18.36 --> 01:39:23.48
The wise commander is the one who uses a chief of staff who sees very few papers or letters

1746
01:39:23.48 --> 01:39:31.68
himself and who sees that the majority of reports that are made to him are verbal and short.

1747
01:39:31.68 --> 01:39:36.40
Only in this way giving himself plenty of time for quiet fought and reflection will he be, will he keep himself

1748
01:39:36.40 --> 01:39:40.92
mentally fresh and capable of producing the sound plan of operations which will defeat his

1749
01:39:40.92 --> 01:39:42.24
enemy.

1750
01:39:42.24 --> 01:39:46.84
For the plan of operations must always be made by the commander and he must not be forced

1751
01:39:46.84 --> 01:39:52.44
upon him, by his staff, by his circumstances or by the enemy.

1752
01:39:52.44 --> 01:39:54.000
That's pretty important.

1753
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.92
Why are you allowing the circumstances or the enemy to dictate how you're going to do

1754
01:39:58.92 --> 01:39:59.92
things?

1755
01:39:59.92 --> 01:40:04.24
You're going to be a good call.

1756
01:40:04.24 --> 01:40:10.16
A commander must decide how he will fight the battle before it begins.

1757
01:40:10.16 --> 01:40:14.40
He must decide how he will use the military effort at his disposal to force the battle

1758
01:40:14.40 --> 01:40:17.32
to swing the way he wishes it to go.

1759
01:40:17.32 --> 01:40:23.04
To be able to do this, his dispositions must be so balanced that he can ignore enemy reactions

1760
01:40:23.04 --> 01:40:27.88
and continue with his own plan until he is certain of success.

1761
01:40:27.88 --> 01:40:32.16
He has got to strive to read the mind of his opponent to anticipate heavy enemy reactions

1762
01:40:32.16 --> 01:40:36.52
to his own moves and to take quick steps to prevent enemy interference with his own

1763
01:40:36.52 --> 01:40:37.52
plan.

1764
01:40:37.52 --> 01:40:40.80
This is a little bit sketchy to me because now we're talking about hey I'm just driving

1765
01:40:40.80 --> 01:40:42.44
forward with my plan no matter what.

1766
01:40:42.44 --> 01:40:44.88
I don't like that attitude.

1767
01:40:44.88 --> 01:40:45.88
I want to be flexible.

1768
01:40:45.88 --> 01:40:50.32
I'm going to try and stick to my plan, but I'm going to be flexible.

1769
01:40:50.32 --> 01:40:55.20
This is one where, you know, man, I don't even know.

1770
01:40:55.20 --> 01:41:00.60
This is one of those things where sometimes I would get guys that would there be a little

1771
01:41:00.60 --> 01:41:01.60
change.

1772
01:41:01.60 --> 01:41:02.60
They come up with a plan.

1773
01:41:02.60 --> 01:41:06.44
They spend all this time planning for a mission and there'd be a little change.

1774
01:41:06.44 --> 01:41:10.48
Maybe they get ready to go out and some imagery comes in and it shows something little

1775
01:41:10.48 --> 01:41:12.20
but different or maybe they get some intel.

1776
01:41:12.20 --> 01:41:15.36
It's a little bit different and they decide they're going to they've already planned.

1777
01:41:15.36 --> 01:41:16.36
They've already rehearsed.

1778
01:41:16.36 --> 01:41:17.36
They already know what they're doing.

1779
01:41:17.36 --> 01:41:20.000
Everyone's kind of walk through and they decide they're going to change their whole

1780
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.04
plan because of some little thing.

1781
01:41:23.04 --> 01:41:25.80
Now it's a man don't change your whole plan.

1782
01:41:25.80 --> 01:41:27.28
I get you want to make a little adjustment.

1783
01:41:27.28 --> 01:41:29.52
You want to take a little fire team and have them make an adjustment.

1784
01:41:29.52 --> 01:41:31.04
Take a squad, make him do something.

1785
01:41:31.04 --> 01:41:32.04
That's okay.

1786
01:41:32.04 --> 01:41:34.32
Don't try and rearrange your whole plan.

1787
01:41:34.32 --> 01:41:35.52
You've already rehearsed.

1788
01:41:35.52 --> 01:41:36.52
You have to un-rehears.

1789
01:41:36.52 --> 01:41:37.52
You know, hard that is.

1790
01:41:37.52 --> 01:41:42.64
If the un-programmed your team, that is really hard to do.

1791
01:41:42.64 --> 01:41:49.92
So sometimes, and I use this is actually one of those things that slowly I don't really talk

1792
01:41:49.92 --> 01:41:57.24
about very often because but I used to use to be in the combat leadership brief I used

1793
01:41:57.24 --> 01:41:58.24
to give.

1794
01:41:58.24 --> 01:42:01.52
You used to say don't fall for 6% advantage over the enemy.

1795
01:42:01.52 --> 01:42:07.12
What I meant by that was, and I used to draw a target up on the dry erase board.

1796
01:42:07.12 --> 01:42:08.12
It's okay.

1797
01:42:08.12 --> 01:42:11.24
You're going to take down this target so you come up with a plan.

1798
01:42:11.24 --> 01:42:12.24
How do you want to do it?

1799
01:42:12.24 --> 01:42:15.24
I was just set up an L and base maneuver.

1800
01:42:15.24 --> 01:42:16.56
Okay, cool.

1801
01:42:16.56 --> 01:42:19.000
You're getting ready to go out and do this.

1802
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:25.52
You find out that there's an outhouse over the berm over here and there's a chance to

1803
01:42:25.52 --> 01:42:27.52
go out in the morning that the guy could be in that outhouse.

1804
01:42:27.52 --> 01:42:29.000
What do you want to do?

1805
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.28
Some guys would completely change their whole plan.

1806
01:42:33.28 --> 01:42:34.52
Completely change their whole plan.

1807
01:42:34.52 --> 01:42:37.68
Meanwhile, we're launching in two minutes or eight minutes or 20 minutes.

1808
01:42:37.68 --> 01:42:38.68
They've planned this.

1809
01:42:38.68 --> 01:42:39.68
They've rehearsed it.

1810
01:42:39.68 --> 01:42:40.48
Everyone knows what their job was.

1811
01:42:40.48 --> 01:42:42.12
The whole team came up with a plan together.

1812
01:42:42.12 --> 01:42:45.84
I mean, it's like a, it's really in their brains.

1813
01:42:45.84 --> 01:42:49.80
Now they see this little detail because there's a chance that at three o'clock in

1814
01:42:49.80 --> 01:42:53.28
the morning when you hit this target, that the guy that you're looking for is in the

1815
01:42:53.28 --> 01:42:54.28
outhouse.

1816
01:42:54.28 --> 01:42:58.32
So we're going to change our whole plan to make up for this tiny percentage chance that

1817
01:42:58.32 --> 01:43:00.84
this guy is even in the outhouse.

1818
01:43:00.84 --> 01:43:02.24
Not a good call.

1819
01:43:02.24 --> 01:43:04.20
Can you break off a fire team?

1820
01:43:04.20 --> 01:43:06.68
That's going to move over to a position where they can at least keep an eye on the

1821
01:43:06.68 --> 01:43:07.68
outhouse.

1822
01:43:07.68 --> 01:43:08.68
That's fine.

1823
01:43:08.68 --> 01:43:12.08
But don't change your whole damn plan based on this little 6% chance that the enemy

1824
01:43:12.08 --> 01:43:14.16
might do something you didn't expect.

1825
01:43:14.16 --> 01:43:18.08
Or no, the enemy that's something is very unlikely of happening.

1826
01:43:18.08 --> 01:43:19.60
It's not that you didn't expect it.

1827
01:43:19.60 --> 01:43:22.80
Things that you don't expect, that's why you have contingency plans, which is like

1828
01:43:22.80 --> 01:43:26.08
hey, when we find in, if we see any other out buildings that we missed on the

1829
01:43:26.08 --> 01:43:31.28
imagery, we have a fire team designated to go and get eyes on those things from the

1830
01:43:31.28 --> 01:43:32.28
high ground.

1831
01:43:32.28 --> 01:43:33.48
That's contingency plan.

1832
01:43:33.48 --> 01:43:35.48
That works.

1833
01:43:35.48 --> 01:43:40.84
Going back to the commander here, he has got always to be a very clear

1834
01:43:40.84 --> 01:43:45.32
thinker and must aim to be always one move ahead of his opponent.

1835
01:43:45.32 --> 01:43:49.000
I actually prefer to be a 5-boos at my opponent.

1836
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.80
To do this, he must simplify the problem.

1837
01:43:52.80 --> 01:43:58.28
Whenever a problem arises, he must think out the few points, which will form the

1838
01:43:58.28 --> 01:44:01.60
framework of the solution.

1839
01:44:01.60 --> 01:44:04.04
The few things that will really matter.

1840
01:44:04.04 --> 01:44:07.96
So long as the solution to the problem is based on those few things that really matter,

1841
01:44:07.96 --> 01:44:11.72
the solution will be on the right lines.

1842
01:44:11.72 --> 01:44:13.60
Solid.

1843
01:44:13.60 --> 01:44:14.76
Solid.

1844
01:44:14.76 --> 01:44:18.12
You have like this pathway.

1845
01:44:18.12 --> 01:44:22.68
And as long as the pathway is what you want to achieve, as long as you're doing things

1846
01:44:22.68 --> 01:44:25.20
that are on the pathway, you're getting there.

1847
01:44:25.20 --> 01:44:27.60
When you start doing things that are off the pathway, we get a problem.

1848
01:44:27.60 --> 01:44:31.24
Sometimes you've got to look at your subordinates and say, hey, it's not even on the path,

1849
01:44:31.24 --> 01:44:34.64
in the direction that we're heading, because it doesn't seem like a domain.

1850
01:44:34.64 --> 01:44:38.56
A commander must at all times exercise personal command.

1851
01:44:38.56 --> 01:44:45.000
That is to say he must give, must see and give full verbal orders or instructions to

1852
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.20
his subordinate generals on how the battle is to be fought.

1853
01:44:49.20 --> 01:44:52.76
Operational command in the field must be direct and personal.

1854
01:44:52.76 --> 01:44:57.36
No written order can ever be the equivalent of a direct verbal command.

1855
01:44:57.36 --> 01:44:58.76
Interesting.

1856
01:44:58.76 --> 01:45:04.32
And I, my standard is, I do both.

1857
01:45:04.32 --> 01:45:06.32
I say, hey, I go, here's what we're doing.

1858
01:45:06.32 --> 01:45:07.72
Hey, do you understand this?

1859
01:45:07.72 --> 01:45:08.72
Do you have any questions?

1860
01:45:08.72 --> 01:45:09.72
Cool.

1861
01:45:09.72 --> 01:45:12.60
And I send you a message that says, hey, I go this is what we talked about.

1862
01:45:12.60 --> 01:45:13.60
This is what you're doing.

1863
01:45:13.60 --> 01:45:15.60
Making sure you understand.

1864
01:45:15.60 --> 01:45:17.88
If I can, I'm going to do both.

1865
01:45:17.88 --> 01:45:22.88
If you're going to do one, yes, verbal is better.

1866
01:45:22.88 --> 01:45:25.32
Most of the time.

1867
01:45:25.32 --> 01:45:30.12
A commander must therefore understand how to give verbal orders to his subordinates.

1868
01:45:30.12 --> 01:45:35.16
No two generals are the same, each will require different treatment, each will react differently

1869
01:45:35.16 --> 01:45:37.04
by exercising personal command.

1870
01:45:37.04 --> 01:45:41.88
A commander can exert a far greater and more exact influence on the battle and the confidence

1871
01:45:41.88 --> 01:45:47.04
which will grow up between the commander and his generals will be of great value.

1872
01:45:47.04 --> 01:45:53.12
The whole chain of command can thus and only thus be built into a united team who strength

1873
01:45:53.12 --> 01:45:57.84
this based on mutual confidence and understanding.

1874
01:45:57.84 --> 01:45:59.52
Relationships.

1875
01:45:59.52 --> 01:46:00.52
It's all relationships.

1876
01:46:00.52 --> 01:46:03.52
What is talking about right there?

1877
01:46:03.52 --> 01:46:08.72
When the whole army is built into one great team, united in working all out for a common

1878
01:46:08.72 --> 01:46:13.60
purpose, the result is terrific.

1879
01:46:13.60 --> 01:46:18.16
Success in war is due to good teamwork by all members of the fighting forces and to the

1880
01:46:18.16 --> 01:46:23.08
correct use which is made of all members by the team of the team by the commander and

1881
01:46:23.08 --> 01:46:25.08
his staff.

1882
01:46:25.08 --> 01:46:32.92
The failure in war is always due to one of two causes to faulty command or to bad staff

1883
01:46:32.92 --> 01:46:37.32
work and sometimes to both.

1884
01:46:37.32 --> 01:46:42.52
I can think of no instance where the failure has been due to a failure of the fighting

1885
01:46:42.52 --> 01:46:43.52
man.

1886
01:46:43.52 --> 01:46:50.52
The British fighting man will always do what is asked of him, but you must make sure that

1887
01:46:50.52 --> 01:47:01.24
he understands what he is asked to do and also that it is within his capacity to do it.

1888
01:47:01.24 --> 01:47:04.68
If your team is not doing what it is, you want them to do the first person you should

1889
01:47:04.68 --> 01:47:06.52
check is yourself.

1890
01:47:06.52 --> 01:47:09.92
If you're giving people complex orders that they don't understand, there's no possible

1891
01:47:09.92 --> 01:47:10.92
with it.

1892
01:47:10.92 --> 01:47:14.68
They can execute those plans.

1893
01:47:14.68 --> 01:47:16.08
Here's how he closes this out.

1894
01:47:16.08 --> 01:47:22.04
Finally, I do not believe that today a commander can inspire great armies or single units

1895
01:47:22.04 --> 01:47:26.76
or even individual men and lead them to achieve great victories unless he has a proper

1896
01:47:26.76 --> 01:47:30.40
sense of religious truth.

1897
01:47:30.40 --> 01:47:38.40
He must be prepared to acknowledge it and to lead his troops in the light of that truth.

1898
01:47:38.40 --> 01:47:44.76
He must always keep his finger on the spiritual pulse of his army.

1899
01:47:44.76 --> 01:47:51.76
He must be very sure that the spiritual purpose which inspires them is right and true and

1900
01:47:51.76 --> 01:47:56.84
it's clearly expanded to one and all.

1901
01:47:56.84 --> 01:48:00.84
Unless he does this, he can expect no lasting success.

1902
01:48:00.84 --> 01:48:07.48
So, you've got to believe in what you're doing.

1903
01:48:07.48 --> 01:48:12.92
For all leadership, I believe is based on the spiritual quality, the power to inspire others

1904
01:48:12.92 --> 01:48:14.56
to follow.

1905
01:48:14.56 --> 01:48:23.12
This spiritual quality may be for good or may be for evil.

1906
01:48:23.12 --> 01:48:30.48
In many cases, this quality has been devoted toward personal ends and was partly or wholly

1907
01:48:30.48 --> 01:48:31.48
evil.

1908
01:48:31.48 --> 01:48:38.40
And whenever this was so in the end, it failed.

1909
01:48:38.40 --> 01:48:45.56
For leadership which is evil, while it may temporarily succeed, always carries within

1910
01:48:45.56 --> 01:48:55.76
it the seeds of its own destruction.

1911
01:48:55.76 --> 01:48:58.16
That's a solid one.

1912
01:48:58.16 --> 01:49:03.92
Beater ship which is evil, while it may temporarily succeed, always carries within it the

1913
01:49:03.92 --> 01:49:11.52
seeds of its own destruction and that is a theory that I fully believe.

1914
01:49:11.52 --> 01:49:23.28
And I believe in it on that level, on that high consequence level.

1915
01:49:23.28 --> 01:49:26.68
But I also believe in on a much less dramatic level.

1916
01:49:26.68 --> 01:49:31.36
And this is something that you deal with every day.

1917
01:49:31.36 --> 01:49:35.16
And that's the leader that is looking out for himself.

1918
01:49:35.16 --> 01:49:38.04
The leader that puts himself above his team.

1919
01:49:38.04 --> 01:49:41.92
That leader is eventually going to fail.

1920
01:49:41.92 --> 01:49:44.08
Even though they may temporarily succeed, same thing.

1921
01:49:44.08 --> 01:49:46.92
They may temporarily succeed.

1922
01:49:46.92 --> 01:49:49.60
But eventually they are going to fail.

1923
01:49:49.60 --> 01:49:51.96
That's what's going to happen.

1924
01:49:51.96 --> 01:49:55.76
And I will tell you something else that is true in that is the opposite is that of that.

1925
01:49:55.76 --> 01:50:06.24
And that is if you are doing the right things for the right reasons, then you may temporarily

1926
01:50:06.24 --> 01:50:07.40
fail.

1927
01:50:07.40 --> 01:50:13.96
But you will have the seeds for victory.

1928
01:50:13.96 --> 01:50:15.08
The seeds for victory.

1929
01:50:15.08 --> 01:50:18.88
And the reason that I say seeds is very specific.

1930
01:50:18.88 --> 01:50:23.64
There's a reason why I'm saying that is because seeds are not guaranteed to grow.

1931
01:50:23.64 --> 01:50:26.24
Because you have good intention doesn't mean that you're going to win.

1932
01:50:26.24 --> 01:50:27.96
Doesn't mean that you're going to achieve victory.

1933
01:50:27.96 --> 01:50:30.32
It means you have the seeds for victory.

1934
01:50:30.32 --> 01:50:34.12
Because once you plant those seeds, you have to water them.

1935
01:50:34.12 --> 01:50:35.48
And you have to nourish them.

1936
01:50:35.48 --> 01:50:41.96
And you have to protect them from birds and from squirrels and from vermin.

1937
01:50:41.96 --> 01:50:44.84
And you have to work.

1938
01:50:44.84 --> 01:50:46.08
You have to plant those seeds.

1939
01:50:46.08 --> 01:50:48.72
And then you have to make those seeds grow.

1940
01:50:48.72 --> 01:51:00.36
And if you do that and you continue to do that, then you move forward and you're doing

1941
01:51:00.36 --> 01:51:02.44
it for the right reasons.

1942
01:51:02.44 --> 01:51:09.64
In the end you are going to win.

1943
01:51:09.64 --> 01:51:17.60
And you know that middle section of this, Monti went pretty deep, talking about morale

1944
01:51:17.60 --> 01:51:22.60
and he has a whole other section here that I've got on morale.

1945
01:51:22.60 --> 01:51:26.08
But I think we're going to save that for another podcast.

1946
01:51:26.08 --> 01:51:30.92
That's where all ready to hours do.

1947
01:51:30.92 --> 01:51:39.56
Until then, echo Charles, if we want to keep our morale high, if we want to nourish the seeds,

1948
01:51:39.56 --> 01:51:41.68
we want to protect them.

1949
01:51:41.68 --> 01:51:42.68
Sure.

1950
01:51:42.68 --> 01:51:45.68
And we want to do the right things for the right reason.

1951
01:51:45.68 --> 01:51:46.68
Always.

1952
01:51:46.68 --> 01:51:48.68
We're doing, just dominate.

1953
01:51:48.68 --> 01:51:49.68
Or we're doing dominate.

1954
01:51:49.68 --> 01:51:52.68
We're kind of looking at something or looking at dominate.

1955
01:51:52.68 --> 01:51:53.68
We're possibly looking at a dominate.

1956
01:51:53.68 --> 01:51:55.68
We're not looking at a dominate.

1957
01:51:55.68 --> 01:51:56.68
Man.

1958
01:51:56.68 --> 01:51:57.68
No.

1959
01:51:57.68 --> 01:52:00.68
But you've got to be able to.

1960
01:52:00.68 --> 01:52:01.68
We'll probably come.

1961
01:52:01.68 --> 01:52:02.68
We'll revisit that word.

1962
01:52:02.68 --> 01:52:03.68
But you have to.

1963
01:52:03.68 --> 01:52:07.68
We'll do the full study of that word and dig deep.

1964
01:52:07.68 --> 01:52:10.68
At a minimum, it means hey, we're going to dominate.

1965
01:52:10.68 --> 01:52:13.68
I'm going to, if it's got dominates the room and a positive way.

1966
01:52:13.68 --> 01:52:14.68
Yeah.

1967
01:52:14.68 --> 01:52:17.68
At the extreme, it's like this guy just has a dominant personality.

1968
01:52:17.68 --> 01:52:18.68
Yeah.

1969
01:52:18.68 --> 01:52:20.68
The problem is how often do you see the person with a dominant personality that runs

1970
01:52:20.68 --> 01:52:21.68
everyone the wrong way?

1971
01:52:21.68 --> 01:52:22.68
Happens all the time.

1972
01:52:22.68 --> 01:52:23.68
Dominant.

1973
01:52:23.68 --> 01:52:24.68
Like, Dominary.

1974
01:52:24.68 --> 01:52:25.68
Yeah.

1975
01:52:25.68 --> 01:52:26.68
This guy's got a dominant.

1976
01:52:26.68 --> 01:52:27.68
You know, we don't want to want some on the team.

1977
01:52:27.68 --> 01:52:28.68
Yeah.

1978
01:52:28.68 --> 01:52:29.68
Because you can't get a word in that twice.

1979
01:52:29.68 --> 01:52:32.68
That's why I question the use of this word.

1980
01:52:32.68 --> 01:52:33.68
Yeah.

1981
01:52:33.68 --> 01:52:37.68
Now, that being said, and I can see this.

1982
01:52:37.68 --> 01:52:39.68
Oh, I can see this.

1983
01:52:39.68 --> 01:52:42.68
Just because someone has the will to dominate.

1984
01:52:42.68 --> 01:52:44.68
And it's strong.

1985
01:52:44.68 --> 01:52:47.68
Doesn't mean that they sit there and rub everyone the wrong way.

1986
01:52:47.68 --> 01:52:52.68
Because if they really had the will to dominate, what they would do is back off.

1987
01:52:52.68 --> 01:52:58.68
And allow others to step up and allow others to have their say and allow others to try and lead.

1988
01:52:58.68 --> 01:53:00.68
And to actually lead.

1989
01:53:00.68 --> 01:53:01.68
Yeah.

1990
01:53:01.68 --> 01:53:08.68
If they were really going to play the game, they might have the strongest will to dominate.

1991
01:53:08.68 --> 01:53:15.68
But they don't act that way because they realize that that's counterproductive to actually dominating.

1992
01:53:15.68 --> 01:53:16.68
Yeah.

1993
01:53:16.68 --> 01:53:18.68
You look like you're confused.

1994
01:53:18.68 --> 01:53:19.68
I mean, not, yeah.

1995
01:53:19.68 --> 01:53:21.68
I mean, I don't know what to check it out.

1996
01:53:21.68 --> 01:53:22.68
So check it out.

1997
01:53:22.68 --> 01:53:22.68
Confused.

1998
01:53:22.68 --> 01:53:25.68
But I think that if.

1999
01:53:25.68 --> 01:53:31.68
I feel like there's just a there's a more general broad use or meaning for that word.

2000
01:53:31.68 --> 01:53:32.68
That's what I think.

2001
01:53:32.68 --> 01:53:34.68
So I think you're right.

2002
01:53:34.68 --> 01:53:37.68
That being said, it could also be.

2003
01:53:37.68 --> 01:53:46.68
If you have somebody that has a strong incredibly powerful will to dominate, but they realize that that is abrasive.

2004
01:53:46.68 --> 01:53:50.68
And it is not the best way to actually win in a situation.

2005
01:53:50.68 --> 01:53:55.68
They will modulate and they will tamper that will to dominate.

2006
01:53:55.68 --> 01:54:00.68
So that it best serves the accomplishment of the mission.

2007
01:54:00.68 --> 01:54:04.68
And therefore best serves their domination.

2008
01:54:04.68 --> 01:54:05.68
Yeah.

2009
01:54:05.68 --> 01:54:09.68
And I think they, you know, it just does feel at this point right now.

2010
01:54:09.68 --> 01:54:11.68
It feels like that might be kind of a reach.

2011
01:54:11.68 --> 01:54:17.68
It's like that thing that I talked about at the master of.

2012
01:54:17.68 --> 01:54:21.68
Of what is what is leadership.

2013
01:54:21.68 --> 01:54:25.68
And and I talk about how like leadership is winning in all costs.

2014
01:54:25.68 --> 01:54:28.68
And there's been some people that say, well, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2015
01:54:28.68 --> 01:54:30.68
Winning at all costs seems like a bad attitude.

2016
01:54:30.68 --> 01:54:32.68
But the whole.

2017
01:54:32.68 --> 01:54:37.68
Because you put a clip like that for an advertisement for the master in a little master clip.

2018
01:54:37.68 --> 01:54:38.68
Sure.

2019
01:54:38.68 --> 01:54:41.68
You put me going leadership is winning at all costs, right?

2020
01:54:41.68 --> 01:54:46.68
And there was something that culminated commented on our on the echelon front extreme ownership.

2021
01:54:46.68 --> 01:54:49.68
Facebook, private group.

2022
01:54:49.68 --> 01:54:52.68
That, you know, I don't know if I like this.

2023
01:54:52.68 --> 01:54:55.68
This seems a little bit that doesn't seem like a good attitude.

2024
01:54:55.68 --> 01:55:00.68
And you know, I replied that, hey, you have to hear the whole thing.

2025
01:55:00.68 --> 01:55:03.68
That's only a few seconds.

2026
01:55:03.68 --> 01:55:18.68
Because what it goes on to say is if you really want to win, then you'll compromise, then you'll make exceptions, then you build relationships and you'll take a back step and you'll put your you will subordinate your ego.

2027
01:55:18.68 --> 01:55:20.68
Yeah, that's the biggest thing that I got.

2028
01:55:20.68 --> 01:55:21.68
Biggest thing.

2029
01:55:21.68 --> 01:55:27.68
We will subordinate your ego because you'll put the mission above your own personal will to dominate.

2030
01:55:27.68 --> 01:55:35.68
You'll subordinate your will to dominate so that you can actually win in the long term in the long game.

2031
01:55:35.68 --> 01:55:42.68
Yeah, it's important to remember if you heard you hear the whole speech of it or the whole segment we'll say.

2032
01:55:42.68 --> 01:55:52.68
Yeah, is that yeah, you talk like a lot about where like there's like battles and then there's the overall victory and like there's all this stuff.

2033
01:55:52.68 --> 01:55:53.68
Yeah, sure.

2034
01:55:53.68 --> 01:56:02.68
There's the dramatic parts when you're like nothing's going to get in my way, but yeah, like you sacrifice so much where.

2035
01:56:02.68 --> 01:56:06.68
Okay, so when you say we know all costs it kind of this is what it sounds like if you just hear that line.

2036
01:56:06.68 --> 01:56:11.68
Yeah, nothing's going to get in my it sounds like even at the cost of like half of my men or something.

2037
01:56:11.68 --> 01:56:14.68
Not only that, but in the corporate world, I'll just step on anyone I need to do right.

2038
01:56:14.68 --> 01:56:22.68
I'll all send bad product out to the consumers and I don't care if they get hurt or I don't care if it's I don't care whatever I'm just going to win.

2039
01:56:22.68 --> 01:56:23.68
Yeah, like that.

2040
01:56:23.68 --> 01:56:24.68
Yeah, that's what that's what people think.

2041
01:56:24.68 --> 01:56:35.68
So yeah, so in that guy's defense, it sounds like that, but again, the whole speech really, I mean really the one of the main actually the takeaway if not anything is like winning what is winning.

2042
01:56:35.68 --> 01:56:39.68
Like, you know, if I lose half of my men, did you really win?

2043
01:56:39.68 --> 01:56:46.68
I think you actually say that's not a victory, but also how can you carry on with your mission?

2044
01:56:46.68 --> 01:56:48.68
You can't you get your mission in cable one now.

2045
01:56:48.68 --> 01:56:57.68
Yeah, I'm actually putting I'm actually putting that I'm going to I'm going to write that down capture that and I'm going to redo it for EF online.

2046
01:56:57.68 --> 01:57:00.68
What that that that part that part.

2047
01:57:00.68 --> 01:57:05.68
Yeah, you know, so that way people can understand what winning at all costs what what that means what I'm talking about.

2048
01:57:05.68 --> 01:57:07.68
Yeah, so we'll put that on EF online.

2049
01:57:07.68 --> 01:57:10.68
If anybody wants to check that out.

2050
01:57:10.68 --> 01:57:13.68
Yeah, if you don't know what that is.

2051
01:57:13.68 --> 01:57:29.68
EF online is interactive leadership training from my company, Eshelon Front where we travel the world teaching companies, businesses, organizations about leadership.

2052
01:57:29.68 --> 01:57:37.68
In the course of doing that, we eventually got to a point where we couldn't service all the people that wanted our service.

2053
01:57:37.68 --> 01:57:46.68
And be some of the companies that we could service, we couldn't service all their employees because they have 50,000 employees and they want to have everyone get trained by Eshelon Front.

2054
01:57:46.68 --> 01:57:50.68
So talking to Lave during a board meeting.

2055
01:57:50.68 --> 01:57:52.68
Are you sure?

2056
01:57:52.68 --> 01:57:59.68
Yes, so Lave and I were surfing that said brother, we need to figure out a way to scale this stuff.

2057
01:57:59.68 --> 01:58:05.68
And we, you know, I asked it, let's let's look at doing something online and Lave was initially like,

2058
01:58:05.68 --> 01:58:07.68
what makes sense by the way?

2059
01:58:07.68 --> 01:58:08.68
Yeah, for sure.

2060
01:58:08.68 --> 01:58:15.68
No, and I, I wanted to explore and I wasn't like all and out of the gate, but I was feeling pretty good about it because I'd seen some stuff.

2061
01:58:15.68 --> 01:58:17.68
Lave really hadn't seen anything.

2062
01:58:17.68 --> 01:58:21.68
You know, he'd basically seen, well, used to get trained online in the Navy.

2063
01:58:21.68 --> 01:58:28.68
Yeah, like for some just, the most ridiculous sort of things that send you some online training.

2064
01:58:28.68 --> 01:58:38.68
Yeah, if you get a DUI, this is you know, check this box if you think you're going to be in trouble. You know, you know, you're just really not the best training and that's kind of what Lave had in mind.

2065
01:58:38.68 --> 01:58:39.68
Yeah.

2066
01:58:39.68 --> 01:58:47.68
But eventually we decided to take a look at it and once we looked at it, it's like, oh man, there's the capabilities unbelievable to do interactive training and all that stuff.

2067
01:58:47.68 --> 01:58:52.68
So we invested in it, we did it and now we've got this thing.

2068
01:58:52.68 --> 01:59:02.68
We used it primarily, we used it primarily for our enterprise clients. So when our clients work in the company and they go, well, what are we going to do with our other 14,000 employees?

2069
01:59:02.68 --> 01:59:04.68
How are we going to train them? Well, here you go.

2070
01:59:04.68 --> 01:59:07.68
Now, now that's what they're doing. They're training through that.

2071
01:59:07.68 --> 01:59:19.68
Great feedback and, you know, the decision was, well, you know, there's not everyone is in a big company and so maybe some of the smaller companies or just individuals.

2072
01:59:19.68 --> 01:59:28.68
Because sometimes, you know, look at some of those people come to the master and they're paying their own way to come to the master obviously and their their companies not supporting it.

2073
01:59:28.68 --> 01:59:33.68
But they want to improve. So that's why they're there at the master.

2074
01:59:33.68 --> 01:59:35.68
Well, it's the same thing with the EF online.

2075
01:59:35.68 --> 01:59:43.68
Sometimes you might just do it on your own because you want to become a better leader. Why not get the experience of the echelon front team?

2076
01:59:43.68 --> 01:59:52.68
The principals in practice, you get to try and so that's what it is. So anyways, we add modules every month like new training.

2077
01:59:52.68 --> 02:00:02.68
And so I'm going to put the what is leadership and the winning at all costs thing on there. So people can listen to what that's really about and what it really means.

2078
02:00:02.68 --> 02:00:07.68
Yeah, yeah, that broader views important in my opinion.

2079
02:00:07.68 --> 02:00:21.68
Also, what's important in my opinion is the key you get for jiu-jitsu when you're doing jiu-jitsu. Yes, it's thing when you start jiu-jitsu and you put on a key. You don't have any basis for comparison. You know, I'm just staying home important that is.

2080
02:00:21.68 --> 02:00:29.68
If you want to put on a straight jacket when you take a drive around the block.

2081
02:00:29.68 --> 02:00:33.68
No, correct. Sometimes you have to run.

2082
02:00:33.68 --> 02:00:40.68
You do it. And that's what it'll feel like if you buy one of these other geese.

2083
02:00:40.68 --> 02:00:47.68
Yeah, sometimes anyway. So the key you get is origin. You get an origin, ghee. Many selections on there.

2084
02:00:47.68 --> 02:00:50.68
Yeah, to fit who you are.

2085
02:00:50.68 --> 02:00:54.68
And also there's jeans on there. Yes, there is.

2086
02:00:54.68 --> 02:00:59.68
Yeah, I say origin jeans. Major America American denim American denim.

2087
02:00:59.68 --> 02:01:06.68
And they don't have their live well. You need to order a pair then. All right. Maybe it will get some. Okay.

2088
02:01:06.68 --> 02:01:12.68
Yeah, their live. They are awesome. Highest quality possible. Every detail.

2089
02:01:12.68 --> 02:01:16.68
Go if you want to find out what because the jeans.

2090
02:01:16.68 --> 02:01:27.68
They're right now. The price point is 124 bucks. That's a lot of money for a pair of jeans. I understand that. If you buy two pairs is 99 bucks each. Here's the deal.

2091
02:01:27.68 --> 02:01:34.68
If you want to know why they cost that much, go on to origin, BJJ.

2092
02:01:34.68 --> 02:01:41.68
Facebook and watch Pete's video where he breaks down the details in the jeans.

2093
02:01:41.68 --> 02:01:47.68
You can see the whole thing. Why every little detail is covered denim pockets.

2094
02:01:47.68 --> 02:01:52.68
Belt, every little thing is done perfectly to the next level. And so they're more expensive.

2095
02:01:52.68 --> 02:01:58.68
Because we're just kicking it off. Once we get, once we keep building them, we'll get more efficient.

2096
02:01:58.68 --> 02:02:02.68
So yeah, eventually the price is going to come down. If you can't afford them right now, I meant it's cool. Let's go. I get it.

2097
02:02:02.68 --> 02:02:09.68
Do jeans have the whole situation of the first edition? Well, they are technically right now. You can get first edition.

2098
02:02:09.68 --> 02:02:16.68
Yeah, but that would be like a first batch of them. First run. What he's first in his life right now.

2099
02:02:16.68 --> 02:02:18.68
Yeah, first edition.

2100
02:02:18.68 --> 02:02:23.68
But you ever seen those like designer jeans that cost like $300, how they're made?

2101
02:02:23.68 --> 02:02:29.68
This is where you see people that are scraping them with rocks. Yeah, no, well, no, no, it's worse.

2102
02:02:29.68 --> 02:02:33.68
Because I've seen worse. It's worse than that. So they get regular jeans, whatever, and it's a certain color.

2103
02:02:33.68 --> 02:02:38.68
And it's just denim from wherever. And this factory in, I forget where.

2104
02:02:38.68 --> 02:02:41.68
But you know, a factory in a factory in some China.

2105
02:02:41.68 --> 02:02:50.68
Yeah, I think it's China in Pakistan or in India. And there's, you know, these little kids that are nine years old exposed to chemicals.

2106
02:02:50.68 --> 02:02:52.68
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2107
02:02:52.68 --> 02:03:01.68
The one I saw on a little bit was more tame than that. But nonetheless, they're like super like 300 L jeans or two figures or something like this.

2108
02:03:01.68 --> 02:03:07.68
And they go and the way they're made, I'm like, how is that even worth 300? Like they cut the jeans like normal.

2109
02:03:07.68 --> 02:03:14.68
And it's like denim, you know, whatever. And then they do them like, and they put like this steam on them and then they send it to the next person.

2110
02:03:14.68 --> 02:03:22.68
The next station in the factory. And the next station has this like, it's almost like a like a fishing line on a, what do you call like a wheel.

2111
02:03:22.68 --> 02:03:24.68
Like to make it look abused or whatever.

2112
02:03:24.68 --> 02:03:32.68
Exactly. So it was, and it spins on the jeans and it makes it look a certain level of abuse to the, or whether it or what he called this distress.

2113
02:03:32.68 --> 02:03:37.68
And then it goes to the next little station and this person at the station is just doing everything or one same thing.

2114
02:03:37.68 --> 02:03:44.68
Put it, put it, put it, you know, next station. The next station has like a little, another thing to help it kind of do it. The next station folded it.

2115
02:03:44.68 --> 02:03:53.68
And so I watch that thing with Pete on my point. And I'm like, oh man, I make sense. This all makes sense. Like this is deep, you know, this is good.

2116
02:03:53.68 --> 02:03:56.68
Maybe when I get one. Obviously.

2117
02:03:56.68 --> 02:04:03.68
But I thought back to that factory and I'm thinking, man, how is that worth like $300 or whatever for that thing?

2118
02:04:03.68 --> 02:04:08.68
It was such a throwaway process like when you, you know, when you see it and feel it. So I dig it man.

2119
02:04:08.68 --> 02:04:11.68
They dig it and they are made in America by the way.

2120
02:04:11.68 --> 02:04:17.68
Yeah, for sure. They're made in America. They're made in Maine. They're the cotton from America is died in America.

2121
02:04:17.68 --> 02:04:24.68
It's woven in America. And yeah, the price point is more expensive than what you're going to pay.

2122
02:04:24.68 --> 02:04:30.68
Hey, you know, I don't want you to go out and spend your last dollar on this pair of orange and jeans. No, man.

2123
02:04:30.68 --> 02:04:37.68
But if you want to help out and you want the bet they are the best possible jeans you get. If you want them, then cool.

2124
02:04:37.68 --> 02:04:38.68
That'd be cool.

2125
02:04:38.68 --> 02:04:39.68
Yep.

2126
02:04:39.68 --> 02:04:42.68
But don't need to freak out.

2127
02:04:42.68 --> 02:04:45.68
I'm not freaking out on my end.

2128
02:04:45.68 --> 02:04:51.68
We're trying to make good, we're trying to make good quality products and our real mission is long term mission.

2129
02:04:51.68 --> 02:04:57.68
We're trying to bring manufacturing back to America. We want these, we want to get these jeans down to a price point. How do we do that?

2130
02:04:57.68 --> 02:05:03.68
Increase the volume. Make more of them. There'll be economies of scale. We'll be able to lower the prices for sure.

2131
02:05:03.68 --> 02:05:07.68
Absolutely. You know what? We talked to some.

2132
02:05:07.68 --> 02:05:12.68
Gene people, denim people. They, they wanted us to charge $300 for these jeans.

2133
02:05:12.68 --> 02:05:12.68
Yeah.

2134
02:05:12.68 --> 02:05:15.68
Because they're like, well, you know, these are.

2135
02:05:15.68 --> 02:05:17.68
Wait, what do they say? They were premium?

2136
02:05:17.68 --> 02:05:23.68
Premium jeans, but there was another word too. Anyways, you know, there's, there's people that pay that kind of money for jeans.

2137
02:05:23.68 --> 02:05:24.68
Are they?

2138
02:05:24.68 --> 02:05:24.68
Are they?

2139
02:05:24.68 --> 02:05:25.68
One of them.

2140
02:05:25.68 --> 02:05:25.68
Yeah.

2141
02:05:25.68 --> 02:05:26.68
You know?

2142
02:05:26.68 --> 02:05:27.68
I don't know.

2143
02:05:27.68 --> 02:05:28.68
But anyways.

2144
02:05:28.68 --> 02:05:34.68
Yeah. Either way, well, the good news about the whole situation, including made in America, they do have other stuff.

2145
02:05:34.68 --> 02:05:36.68
So, and at the moment, I haven't talked about these shorts.

2146
02:05:36.68 --> 02:05:39.68
So, and I don't know if you notice what I wear all the time.

2147
02:05:39.68 --> 02:05:39.68
Yes.

2148
02:05:39.68 --> 02:05:42.68
But the only thing I wear is these shorts.

2149
02:05:42.68 --> 02:05:50.68
Only one straight up. I mean, unless it's like, you know, to train or something like this, but like just around is only the origin shorts of the shark.

2150
02:05:50.68 --> 02:05:50.68
Shark.

2151
02:05:50.68 --> 02:05:50.68
Shark.

2152
02:05:50.68 --> 02:05:52.68
Or whatever. Yeah.

2153
02:05:52.68 --> 02:05:53.68
I have like six pairs of them.

2154
02:05:53.68 --> 02:05:58.68
It's like the same thing. So, I'm sure it's like, you know, if you go through your routine, like, you know, with the store.

2155
02:05:58.68 --> 02:06:02.68
They're like, probably the sky wears the same shorts every day, but, well, one of them has a green logo.

2156
02:06:02.68 --> 02:06:03.68
They have another black logo.

2157
02:06:03.68 --> 02:06:10.68
Either way, these are literally the best shorts in the, like, ever made that I've put on straight up.

2158
02:06:10.68 --> 02:06:10.68
Yes.

2159
02:06:10.68 --> 02:06:11.68
So, you can get those.

2160
02:06:11.68 --> 02:06:12.68
Yeah, go Charlie.

2161
02:06:12.68 --> 02:06:13.68
There you go.

2162
02:06:13.68 --> 02:06:16.68
That's me in the mirror. He all a big time. And I'm, that's for real though.

2163
02:06:16.68 --> 02:06:17.68
Yeah.

2164
02:06:17.68 --> 02:06:20.68
Well, you also said that about their, their joggers.

2165
02:06:20.68 --> 02:06:24.68
Well, you know, those are the most comfortable for sure.

2166
02:06:24.68 --> 02:06:25.68
Yeah.

2167
02:06:25.68 --> 02:06:29.68
And, and, well, and, you know what, let's show you what I'm trying on joggers.

2168
02:06:29.68 --> 02:06:30.68
You told me about it.

2169
02:06:30.68 --> 02:06:31.68
You told me about it.

2170
02:06:31.68 --> 02:06:32.68
It was, yeah.

2171
02:06:32.68 --> 02:06:34.68
The whole idea is that sounds ridiculous.

2172
02:06:34.68 --> 02:06:35.68
Yeah.

2173
02:06:35.68 --> 02:06:37.68
You don't have a jogger, uh, what do you call, physique?

2174
02:06:37.68 --> 02:06:38.68
Yeah.

2175
02:06:38.68 --> 02:06:40.68
What do you need to, what's the jogger physique?

2176
02:06:40.68 --> 02:06:42.68
I'm like skinny knees or what.

2177
02:06:42.68 --> 02:06:53.68
I don't know that I can put my finger on what exactly a jogger physique is, but I can tell you that I don't have it.

2178
02:06:53.68 --> 02:06:54.68
I can firm that.

2179
02:06:54.68 --> 02:06:55.68
Yeah.

2180
02:06:55.68 --> 02:06:59.68
So, don't worry about the joggers if you're jockel, but if anyone else, those joggers are,

2181
02:06:59.68 --> 02:07:07.68
factually, the most comfortable, uh, jogger, sweat situation, close, in existence.

2182
02:07:07.68 --> 02:07:08.68
Currently, currently.

2183
02:07:08.68 --> 02:07:10.68
You got some supplements, too.

2184
02:07:10.68 --> 02:07:15.68
Uh, joint warfare, criminal, discipline, discipline, go.

2185
02:07:15.68 --> 02:07:19.68

You know, when he gets this big wire smile on his face, because he took a cup of hits of the discipline.

And I just was telling Brian, no, hey man, I don't care.

2223
02:08:34.68 --> 02:08:36.68
I'm going to make it a bigger scoop in or whatever.

2224
02:08:36.68 --> 02:08:37.68
Just re-duplicate it.

2225
02:08:37.68 --> 02:08:39.68
But you know, he's like, no, it's got a more protein.

2226
02:08:39.68 --> 02:08:41.68
It's a don'ts blah blah blah.

2227
02:08:41.68 --> 02:08:42.68
And somehow he made it.

2228
02:08:42.68 --> 02:08:46.68
It's actually, it's actually better or at least as good.

2229
02:08:46.68 --> 02:08:47.68
Might be better.

2230
02:08:47.68 --> 02:08:49.68
It's so good.

2231
02:08:49.68 --> 02:08:50.68
Dude, it's so good.

2232
02:08:50.68 --> 02:08:51.68
It's ridiculous.

2233
02:08:51.68 --> 02:08:53.68
It's a straight up dessert.

2234
02:08:53.68 --> 02:08:55.68
It tastes like a milkshake straight up.

2235
02:08:55.68 --> 02:08:57.68
If you mix it with milk, which is what I mix it with.

2236
02:08:57.68 --> 02:09:00.68
It tastes like a strawberry milkshake.

2237
02:09:00.68 --> 02:09:02.68
It tastes better than a strawberry milkshake.

2238
02:09:02.68 --> 02:09:05.68
So if it's so good, it's ridiculous.

2239
02:09:05.68 --> 02:09:06.68
Okay, you got a blind taste test.

2240
02:09:06.68 --> 02:09:08.68
You got all the protein that you need.

2241
02:09:08.68 --> 02:09:09.68
Here you go.

2242
02:09:09.68 --> 02:09:11.68
And then you have blind taste test.

2243
02:09:11.68 --> 02:09:14.68
You got to imagine because you know the difference I get it.

2244
02:09:14.68 --> 02:09:19.68
So you have a cup of warrior could milk, strawberry, adult mold.

2245
02:09:19.68 --> 02:09:20.68
We'll just say, milk.

2246
02:09:20.68 --> 02:09:21.68
Yeah.

2247
02:09:21.68 --> 02:09:22.68
Strawberry.

2248
02:09:22.68 --> 02:09:23.68
Right.

2249
02:09:23.68 --> 02:09:26.68
Which one are you going to choose?

2250
02:09:26.68 --> 02:09:28.68
Which one are you, you, you, you.

2251
02:09:28.68 --> 02:09:29.68
I think I'm going to go for the adult.

2252
02:09:29.68 --> 02:09:33.68
I thought you were going to throw a hog and a strawberry shake in there.

2253
02:09:33.68 --> 02:09:34.68
Oh yeah.

2254
02:09:34.68 --> 02:09:35.68
Here's the deal.

2255
02:09:35.68 --> 02:09:37.68
I'm not picking the hog and a toss.

2256
02:09:37.68 --> 02:09:38.68
It's too much.

2257
02:09:38.68 --> 02:09:39.68
It's too much.

2258
02:09:39.68 --> 02:09:41.68
Yeah, that's kind of why I didn't say it.

2259
02:09:41.68 --> 02:09:43.68
And it's not even too much in a good way.

2260
02:09:43.68 --> 02:09:45.68
It's too much in a bad way.

2261
02:09:45.68 --> 02:09:46.68
Right.

2262
02:09:46.68 --> 02:09:47.68
It's like you don't want to drink it.

2263
02:09:47.68 --> 02:09:49.68
The strawberry milk you're like,

2264
02:09:49.68 --> 02:09:50.68
Just pounding it.

2265
02:09:50.68 --> 02:09:51.68
Yeah.

2266
02:09:51.68 --> 02:09:52.68
It's true.

2267
02:09:52.68 --> 02:09:53.68
Actually feeling good about things.

2268
02:09:53.68 --> 02:09:54.68
Yeah.

2269
02:09:54.68 --> 02:09:55.68
Interesting.

2270
02:09:55.68 --> 02:09:56.68
All right.

2271
02:09:56.68 --> 02:09:56.68
Well, I'm going to try that one.

2272
02:09:56.68 --> 02:09:57.68
Because I have no actually weight.

2273
02:09:57.68 --> 02:09:58.68
I think he might as well.

2274
02:09:58.68 --> 02:10:00.68
He should have put some in the mail.

2275
02:10:00.68 --> 02:10:00.68
Yeah.

2276
02:10:00.68 --> 02:10:01.68
It just came out.

2277
02:10:01.68 --> 02:10:04.68
I have not tried it yet, but we'll report back to 100%.

2278
02:10:04.68 --> 02:10:04.68
Yeah.

2279
02:10:04.68 --> 02:10:05.68
100%.

2280
02:10:05.68 --> 02:10:06.68
Jocca weight, too, as well.

2281
02:10:06.68 --> 02:10:07.68
Yes.

2282
02:10:07.68 --> 02:10:08.68
Don't forget about that.

2283
02:10:08.68 --> 02:10:11.68
It'll get you to eat 1,000 pound deadlift, which is no big deal to some people to me.

2284
02:10:11.68 --> 02:10:12.68
It's kind of a big deal.

2285
02:10:12.68 --> 02:10:14.68
And this organic, by the way.

2286
02:10:14.68 --> 02:10:17.68
So, you know, I'm not a person or a organic certified.

2287
02:10:17.68 --> 02:10:19.68
Check.

2288
02:10:19.68 --> 02:10:22.68
Also, yes, we have a store.

2289
02:10:22.68 --> 02:10:24.68
Jocco has a store.

2290
02:10:24.68 --> 02:10:25.68
So I made a video.

2291
02:10:25.68 --> 02:10:28.68
It was fun about it with nothing like super in depth.

2292
02:10:28.68 --> 02:10:31.68
But, you know, I got all our friends training partners.

2293
02:10:31.68 --> 02:10:32.68
Yeah.

2294
02:10:32.68 --> 02:10:33.68
Are people?

2295
02:10:33.68 --> 02:10:34.68
Where you got?

2296
02:10:34.68 --> 02:10:35.68
Noah.

2297
02:10:35.68 --> 02:10:36.68
Noah.

2298
02:10:36.68 --> 02:10:37.68
Oliver.

2299
02:10:37.68 --> 02:10:38.68
Noah's got good on locks.

2300
02:10:38.68 --> 02:10:39.68
Yeah.

2301
02:10:39.68 --> 02:10:42.68
He's actually been like, I mean, on top of a great McIntyre.

2302
02:10:42.68 --> 02:10:44.68
He's been kind of my main training partner recently.

2303
02:10:44.68 --> 02:10:45.68
The past few months.

2304
02:10:45.68 --> 02:10:46.68
Yeah.

2305
02:10:46.68 --> 02:10:47.68
The main.

2306
02:10:47.68 --> 02:10:48.68
Yeah.

2307
02:10:48.68 --> 02:10:49.68
So him, yes.

2308
02:10:49.68 --> 02:10:50.68
No Oliver.

2309
02:10:50.68 --> 02:10:51.68
Greg McIntyre.

2310
02:10:51.68 --> 02:10:52.68
Greg Tray.

2311
02:10:52.68 --> 02:10:53.68
Isn't there?

2312
02:10:53.68 --> 02:10:54.68
We got Nadine.

2313
02:10:54.68 --> 02:10:55.68
Nadine.

2314
02:10:55.68 --> 02:10:56.68
Nadine.

2315
02:10:56.68 --> 02:10:57.68
Nadine.

2316
02:10:57.68 --> 02:10:58.68
Nadine.

2317
02:10:58.68 --> 02:11:00.68
Tim Ford.

2318
02:11:00.68 --> 02:11:03.68
Did I say Greg McIntyre?

2319
02:11:03.68 --> 02:11:04.68
Greg?

2320
02:11:04.68 --> 02:11:05.68
He's all up in there.

2321
02:11:05.68 --> 02:11:06.68
Oh, you got Dave Burke.

2322
02:11:06.68 --> 02:11:07.68
Good to hear.

2323
02:11:07.68 --> 02:11:08.68
Yeah.

2324
02:11:08.68 --> 02:11:09.68
Good to hear.

2325
02:11:09.68 --> 02:11:10.68
Good to hear.

2326
02:11:10.68 --> 02:11:11.68
Good to hear.

2327
02:11:11.68 --> 02:11:12.68
Good to hear.

2328
02:11:12.68 --> 02:11:13.68
Good to hear.

2329
02:11:13.68 --> 02:11:14.68
Good to hear.

2330
02:11:14.68 --> 02:11:15.68
Jamie.

2331
02:11:15.68 --> 02:11:16.68
Yeah.

2332
02:11:16.68 --> 02:11:17.68
And then the kids.

2333
02:11:17.68 --> 02:11:19.68
Can we say who's kids there?

2334
02:11:19.68 --> 02:11:20.68
There's some kids in there.

2335
02:11:20.68 --> 02:11:22.68
We'll just say there's some kids in there.

2336
02:11:22.68 --> 02:11:23.68
Yes.

2337
02:11:23.68 --> 02:11:24.68
Yeah.

2338
02:11:24.68 --> 02:11:25.68
So yeah.

2339
02:11:25.68 --> 02:11:26.68
Nadine's in there.

2340
02:11:26.68 --> 02:11:27.68
Tim's there.

2341
02:11:27.68 --> 02:11:28.68
Anyway.

2342
02:11:28.68 --> 02:11:30.68
The point is they're just our friends.

2343
02:11:30.68 --> 02:11:32.68
It was just cool fun video.

2344
02:11:32.68 --> 02:11:33.68
Jockel story.

2345
02:11:33.68 --> 02:11:35.68
You want to do you want something to get or if you like something get something.

2346
02:11:35.68 --> 02:11:36.68
Nonetheless.

2347
02:11:36.68 --> 02:11:40.68
Jockelstore.com is where you can get the shirts that say this political freedom if you want

2348
02:11:40.68 --> 02:11:44.68
to represent in the wild on the path.

2349
02:11:44.68 --> 02:11:47.68
How's this when I was, this was a while ago.

2350
02:11:47.68 --> 02:11:50.68
So my, I had an extra shirt later on.

2351
02:11:50.68 --> 02:11:52.68
It was a size medium.

2352
02:11:52.68 --> 02:11:54.68
That's what you were.

2353
02:11:54.68 --> 02:11:55.68
See, it's funny.

2354
02:11:55.68 --> 02:11:56.68
It's I knew you can say that.

2355
02:11:56.68 --> 02:11:58.68
I knew you're going to say something like that.

2356
02:11:58.68 --> 02:12:02.68
Anyway, I'm taking pictures for this, you know, you got to take pictures for the products.

2357
02:12:02.68 --> 02:12:03.68
Right.

2358
02:12:03.68 --> 02:12:04.68
For the store.

2359
02:12:04.68 --> 02:12:06.68
And for whatever reason the size medium.

2360
02:12:06.68 --> 02:12:09.68
That's the best looking size, I guess, for pictures.

2361
02:12:09.68 --> 02:12:10.68
I don't know.

2362
02:12:10.68 --> 02:12:11.68
Nonetheless, take the picture of it.

2363
02:12:11.68 --> 02:12:12.68
But I have it laying around.

2364
02:12:12.68 --> 02:12:13.68
Right.

2365
02:12:13.68 --> 02:12:15.68
So my wife is like, oh, this is extra shirt.

2366
02:12:15.68 --> 02:12:17.68
And you know, can I give it to like one of my friends or whatever.

2367
02:12:17.68 --> 02:12:21.68
And I wasn't, I had no use for the shirt at this point.

2368
02:12:21.68 --> 02:12:22.68
And I said no.

2369
02:12:22.68 --> 02:12:27.68
Because I don't know if their friend is like going to represent, you know, I don't know if the friend is on the path.

2370
02:12:27.68 --> 02:12:28.68
Yeah.

2371
02:12:28.68 --> 02:12:30.68
What if the friend's not on the path and they're wearing that shirt.

2372
02:12:30.68 --> 02:12:31.68
That's, you know, it's different.

2373
02:12:31.68 --> 02:12:32.68
There's more to it.

2374
02:12:32.68 --> 02:12:33.68
That's what it feels like.

2375
02:12:33.68 --> 02:12:34.68
It's the same thing.

2376
02:12:34.68 --> 02:12:35.68
It's your story.

2377
02:12:35.68 --> 02:12:36.68
On the less.

2378
02:12:36.68 --> 02:12:38.68
When you are on the path.

2379
02:12:38.68 --> 02:12:40.68
And you want to represent in the wild.

2380
02:12:40.68 --> 02:12:42.68
You just go to joclist.com.

2381
02:12:42.68 --> 02:12:45.68
I was at the Joe Rogan show.

2382
02:12:45.68 --> 02:12:46.68
Sure.

2383
02:12:46.68 --> 02:12:47.68
Before 20.

2384
02:12:47.68 --> 02:12:47.68
Yeah.

2385
02:12:47.68 --> 02:12:48.68
The 420 and San Diego.

2386
02:12:48.68 --> 02:12:49.68
With Peter Tia.

2387
02:12:49.68 --> 02:12:50.68
Yeah.

2388
02:12:50.68 --> 02:12:53.68
And we were with a bunch of other dudes.

2389
02:12:53.68 --> 02:13:04.68
And Peter Tia was reminding me that on Twitter, somebody had said, hey, jocco, I wasn't in the

2390
02:13:04.68 --> 02:13:08.68
Seal teams, but I want to show support to the seals.

2391
02:13:08.68 --> 02:13:17.68
Is it cool if I wear like a Navy seal, tried in on my hat or t-shirt?

2392
02:13:17.68 --> 02:13:22.68
And my response was I was in the seal teams for 20 years.

2393
02:13:22.68 --> 02:13:26.68
And I don't wear a seal team hat or t-shirt.

2394
02:13:26.68 --> 02:13:27.68
Yeah.

2395
02:13:27.68 --> 02:13:28.68
So, wait.

2396
02:13:28.68 --> 02:13:29.68
So does that mean yes or no?

2397
02:13:29.68 --> 02:13:30.68
That means no.

2398
02:13:30.68 --> 02:13:31.68
Yeah.

2399
02:13:31.68 --> 02:13:32.68
Hell no, right?

2400
02:13:32.68 --> 02:13:33.68
Because okay.

2401
02:13:33.68 --> 02:13:38.68
So it coincidentally me and good deal Dave Burke were talking about the exact same thing.

2402
02:13:38.68 --> 02:13:40.68
So I forget how we end up talking about it.

2403
02:13:40.68 --> 02:13:44.68
But I was like, hey, what's the, what's the, because he gave me his uniform.

2404
02:13:44.68 --> 02:13:47.68
I was doing something with it for videoizing.

2405
02:13:47.68 --> 02:13:51.68
So I don't know for whatever reason I ended up talking about, but like, what can you wear?

2406
02:13:51.68 --> 02:13:52.68
Like, what can not wear?

2407
02:13:52.68 --> 02:13:53.68
What's off limits?

2408
02:13:53.68 --> 02:13:54.68
Yeah.

2409
02:13:54.68 --> 02:13:57.68
You know, on this thing and he told me is like, you know, some stuff in me.

2410
02:13:57.68 --> 02:13:58.68
But I don't know.

2411
02:13:58.68 --> 02:14:00.68
So he had to sort of explain it to me.

2412
02:14:00.68 --> 02:14:02.68
And that's essentially the scenario he painted.

2413
02:14:02.68 --> 02:14:05.68
He was like, you know how like the Navy seals like they have the tried in.

2414
02:14:05.68 --> 02:14:06.68
Yeah.

2415
02:14:06.68 --> 02:14:07.68
Like you can't just put on a try in.

2416
02:14:07.68 --> 02:14:10.68
You know, like, like if you're not that you bring the tried in here,

2417
02:14:10.68 --> 02:14:13.68
but let's say for whatever reason you're right, I can't just grab it and then like, kind of put it on.

2418
02:14:13.68 --> 02:14:16.68
Even as like for fun, though, it's like,

2419
02:14:16.68 --> 02:14:17.68
That's kind of off limits.

2420
02:14:17.68 --> 02:14:18.68
You know, you can't say.

2421
02:14:18.68 --> 02:14:21.68
And then so you made the comparison to Jitu belts too.

2422
02:14:21.68 --> 02:14:24.68
Like if I grabbed your black belt and put it on,

2423
02:14:24.68 --> 02:14:27.68
granted, you're kind of my friend.

2424
02:14:27.68 --> 02:14:32.68
I could never, you wouldn't even let's say, let's say I wasn't, let's say I wasn't even a white belt.

2425
02:14:32.68 --> 02:14:34.68
Let's say I was like, even like a purple belt.

2426
02:14:34.68 --> 02:14:39.68
And my instructor, who I wasn't necessarily personal friends with, but that was having to be my instructor.

2427
02:14:39.68 --> 02:14:40.68
I can't put that belt on.

2428
02:14:40.68 --> 02:14:45.68
What if he was like, what if you forgot your belt, he was injured and he was on the sidelines and he was like, oh, just wear mine.

2429
02:14:45.68 --> 02:14:46.68
Would you wear it?

2430
02:14:46.68 --> 02:14:47.68
He would never do that.

2431
02:14:47.68 --> 02:14:51.68
But and what's funny is Dave Burke brought that exact scenario up.

2432
02:14:51.68 --> 02:14:52.68
Different colors, though.

2433
02:14:52.68 --> 02:14:53.68
So he had good question.

2434
02:14:53.68 --> 02:14:54.68
What's he like?

2435
02:14:54.68 --> 02:14:55.68
Okay, just wear mine.

2436
02:14:55.68 --> 02:14:56.68
It's a blue belt.

2437
02:14:56.68 --> 02:15:01.68
He said he's in the guy he was training with, I think it was a blue belt that he was training with.

2438
02:15:01.68 --> 02:15:02.68
He was like, hey, I've been extra one.

2439
02:15:02.68 --> 02:15:03.68
You don't have a belt.

2440
02:15:03.68 --> 02:15:06.68
You need a belt to, you know, to train yourself like that.

2441
02:15:06.68 --> 02:15:13.68
You know, this is a blue belt. Dave Burke said out of respect for the guy is like, you know, suggestion. He wore it, but he did not feel good about it.

2442
02:15:13.68 --> 02:15:16.68
Oh, I think that's kind of the deal.

2443
02:15:16.68 --> 02:15:18.68
Where if you somehow get a belt gives you a belt.

2444
02:15:18.68 --> 02:15:26.68
You know what I used to give guys it, like in the, if they started training, I'd give a piece of one inch tube to be the nylon green.

2445
02:15:26.68 --> 02:15:28.68
Yeah, which is just like to tie their belt.

2446
02:15:28.68 --> 02:15:30.68
Do you remember the camera?

2447
02:15:30.68 --> 02:15:31.68
Yeah, ABC.

2448
02:15:31.68 --> 02:15:32.68
Right.

2449
02:15:32.68 --> 02:15:33.68
Yeah, camp.

2450
02:15:33.68 --> 02:15:34.68
Good.

2451
02:15:34.68 --> 02:15:36.68
So, the wrestler and strong.

2452
02:15:36.68 --> 02:15:37.68
Wrong.

2453
02:15:37.68 --> 02:15:38.68
Yes.

2454
02:15:38.68 --> 02:15:40.68
You know, he came to my, is the guy, do you know the camera came to my house and tame the beast?

2455
02:15:40.68 --> 02:15:42.68
Do you know what that is with kettlebell?

2456
02:15:42.68 --> 02:15:43.68
Tame the beast.

2457
02:15:43.68 --> 02:15:47.68
You get the 48 kilogram kettlebell, which you don't have on that big.

2458
02:15:47.68 --> 02:15:48.68
I do.

2459
02:15:48.68 --> 02:15:49.68
No, you don't.

2460
02:15:49.68 --> 02:15:50.68
I have a nice.

2461
02:15:50.68 --> 02:15:54.68
So, I have one, but before I had those, he ordered one.

2462
02:15:54.68 --> 02:15:57.68
And he was like in between houses at the time.

2463
02:15:57.68 --> 02:16:00.68
So he, so he ordered a hat at scent to my house.

2464
02:16:00.68 --> 02:16:01.68
He gets it.

2465
02:16:01.68 --> 02:16:02.68
He comes to my house.

2466
02:16:02.68 --> 02:16:05.68
First time he's ever picked up a 48 kilogram,

2467
02:16:05.68 --> 02:16:07.68
166 pound kettlebell.

2468
02:16:07.68 --> 02:16:10.68
And there's a thing called taming the beast, which is,

2469
02:16:10.68 --> 02:16:15.68
you do a press with that kettlebell.

2470
02:16:15.68 --> 02:16:18.68
You do a pistol with that kettlebell.

2471
02:16:18.68 --> 02:16:22.68
And then you do a pull up with that kettlebell.

2472
02:16:22.68 --> 02:16:24.68
The first time he ever did it, he did it.

2473
02:16:24.68 --> 02:16:25.68
He did it.

2474
02:16:25.68 --> 02:16:26.68
He did it right.

2475
02:16:26.68 --> 02:16:27.68
Did it right?

2476
02:16:27.68 --> 02:16:28.68
All right.

2477
02:16:28.68 --> 02:16:29.68
Like no warm up.

2478
02:16:29.68 --> 02:16:30.68
Just boom.

2479
02:16:30.68 --> 02:16:34.68
Same a lot because he's not a large, like I'm bigger than he's like a what?

2480
02:16:34.68 --> 02:16:35.68
What?

2481
02:16:35.68 --> 02:16:36.68
$195.

2482
02:16:36.68 --> 02:16:37.68
Yeah.

2483
02:16:37.68 --> 02:16:38.68
Maybe $195.

2484
02:16:38.68 --> 02:16:39.68
Yeah.

2485
02:16:39.68 --> 02:16:41.68
Yeah, I might give him like one nonetheless.

2486
02:16:41.68 --> 02:16:42.68
Yeah, that's super good.

2487
02:16:42.68 --> 02:16:43.68
Same a lot.

2488
02:16:43.68 --> 02:16:44.68
No less the point.

2489
02:16:44.68 --> 02:16:47.68
I bring him up is because the first time he ever trained geek.

2490
02:16:47.68 --> 02:16:48.68
Because I trained with him before.

2491
02:16:48.68 --> 02:16:48.68
Yeah.

2492
02:16:48.68 --> 02:16:51.68
And I was like, all this guy's probably at the time.

2493
02:16:51.68 --> 02:16:52.68
Years ago.

2494
02:16:52.68 --> 02:16:53.68
He's probably about.

2495
02:16:53.68 --> 02:16:54.68
I was a pro belt.

2496
02:16:54.68 --> 02:16:54.68
Yeah.

2497
02:16:54.68 --> 02:16:57.68
So I was like, this guy's probably a like a pro belt too.

2498
02:16:57.68 --> 02:16:58.68
So, you know, whatever,

2499
02:16:58.68 --> 02:17:00.68
I mean, with him one day comes in in the geek.

2500
02:17:00.68 --> 02:17:05.68
So I'm like, oh, you know, yeah, that little party is like kind of like, oh yeah, you know, let me confirm.

2501
02:17:05.68 --> 02:17:06.68
We don't want to.

2502
02:17:06.68 --> 02:17:09.68
But he has a piece of that green.

2503
02:17:09.68 --> 02:17:10.68
That dark green.

2504
02:17:10.68 --> 02:17:11.68
That dark green.

2505
02:17:11.68 --> 02:17:12.68
That dark green.

2506
02:17:12.68 --> 02:17:13.68
All right.

2507
02:17:13.68 --> 02:17:14.68
And here's the thing.

2508
02:17:14.68 --> 02:17:17.68
It doesn't just stand out because it's like it's kind of darker whatever.

2509
02:17:17.68 --> 02:17:19.68
But you see new guy come, you know, because he's sort of, you know,

2510
02:17:19.68 --> 02:17:23.68
when you come and train for the first time in gear in some class is kind of like most of those people.

2511
02:17:23.68 --> 02:17:24.68
They kind of go down from the top.

2512
02:17:24.68 --> 02:17:25.68
Yeah, exactly right.

2513
02:17:25.68 --> 02:17:26.68
But this guy's a new guy.

2514
02:17:26.68 --> 02:17:27.68
I knew who he was.

2515
02:17:27.68 --> 02:17:30.68
Like, looking at him like, okay, that's obviously a military piece of equipment.

2516
02:17:30.68 --> 02:17:31.68
It's not a belt.

2517
02:17:31.68 --> 02:17:32.68
It was funny.

2518
02:17:32.68 --> 02:17:33.68
The looks on everyone's face.

2519
02:17:33.68 --> 02:17:35.68
They're like, they're kind of looking at each other.

2520
02:17:35.68 --> 02:17:36.68
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2521
02:17:36.68 --> 02:17:37.68
It was crazy.

2522
02:17:37.68 --> 02:17:39.68
That's the whole world gone crazy.

2523
02:17:39.68 --> 02:17:40.68
Yeah.

2524
02:17:40.68 --> 02:17:41.68
It's really funny.

2525
02:17:41.68 --> 02:17:44.68
But that's how rigid the belt situation is though.

2526
02:17:44.68 --> 02:17:44.68
Yeah.

2527
02:17:44.68 --> 02:17:46.68
That's why you can't just grab a guy's belt.

2528
02:17:46.68 --> 02:17:48.68
And as I know people,

2529
02:17:48.68 --> 02:17:50.68
not specific people,

2530
02:17:50.68 --> 02:17:51.68
but it would stand to reason.

2531
02:17:51.68 --> 02:17:52.68
Put it that way.

2532
02:17:52.68 --> 02:17:54.68
It would stand to reason that even as a joke,

2533
02:17:54.68 --> 02:17:56.68
if I grabbed like,

2534
02:17:56.68 --> 02:17:57.68
you know what's funny?

2535
02:17:57.68 --> 02:17:58.68
As a joke,

2536
02:17:58.68 --> 02:17:59.68
I've been like here just where mine.

2537
02:17:59.68 --> 02:18:00.68
Like some people, you know,

2538
02:18:00.68 --> 02:18:02.68
I've just been like giving people my black belt.

2539
02:18:02.68 --> 02:18:05.68
Like, oh, you know, like a blue belt or a purple belt.

2540
02:18:05.68 --> 02:18:06.68
Like here, you just wear mine and I gave it to me.

2541
02:18:06.68 --> 02:18:10.68
Like, like awkwardly, awkwardly make them do it.

2542
02:18:10.68 --> 02:18:14.68
But that's how that's the dynamics of that.

2543
02:18:14.68 --> 02:18:16.68
Before I really knew Jeff Glover,

2544
02:18:16.68 --> 02:18:18.68
he came down here and did a seminar.

2545
02:18:18.68 --> 02:18:20.68
He's like, hey, I don't know about.

2546
02:18:20.68 --> 02:18:21.68
And I was like, yeah, he can use mine.

2547
02:18:21.68 --> 02:18:23.68
And I was really, I was actually worried.

2548
02:18:23.68 --> 02:18:24.68
Yeah, I was actually worried.

2549
02:18:24.68 --> 02:18:26.68
I was really at one belt.

2550
02:18:26.68 --> 02:18:27.68
I've only had one belt.

2551
02:18:27.68 --> 02:18:29.68
My whole time, like one black belt.

2552
02:18:29.68 --> 02:18:30.68
And I was worried.

2553
02:18:30.68 --> 02:18:31.68
I was like, dang.

2554
02:18:31.68 --> 02:18:33.68
I mean, not that I thought he was going to like steal it.

2555
02:18:33.68 --> 02:18:34.68
But I just was afraid.

2556
02:18:34.68 --> 02:18:37.68
Oh, you know, he'll put in his bag and next thing,

2557
02:18:37.68 --> 02:18:38.68
you know, it's in Santa Barbara.

2558
02:18:38.68 --> 02:18:40.68
And the next thing, you know, I'll never see my belt again.

2559
02:18:40.68 --> 02:18:41.68
My special belt.

2560
02:18:41.68 --> 02:18:42.68
Yeah.

2561
02:18:42.68 --> 02:18:44.68
Oh, there for that day when he did it.

2562
02:18:44.68 --> 02:18:45.68
Because I wasn't here though.

2563
02:18:45.68 --> 02:18:46.68
I wasn't here.

2564
02:18:46.68 --> 02:18:47.68
That was the part I was here.

2565
02:18:47.68 --> 02:18:48.68
And I had to go.

2566
02:18:48.68 --> 02:18:49.68
Yeah.

2567
02:18:49.68 --> 02:18:50.68
And so I didn't get to,

2568
02:18:50.68 --> 02:18:53.68
but he hung it back up Jeffy Glover to care about it.

2569
02:18:53.68 --> 02:18:55.68
I took a picture of him that day.

2570
02:18:55.68 --> 02:18:56.68
Oh, really well.

2571
02:18:56.68 --> 02:18:57.68
But if he was one of my belt.

2572
02:18:57.68 --> 02:18:59.68
He is wearing your belt on the picture.

2573
02:18:59.68 --> 02:19:00.68
And he's doing this.

2574
02:19:00.68 --> 02:19:03.68
And that picture ended up being used for a bunch of different stuff.

2575
02:19:03.68 --> 02:19:03.68
Yeah.

2576
02:19:03.68 --> 02:19:04.68
That's kind of cool.

2577
02:19:04.68 --> 02:19:06.68
And my belt made it kind of famous with Jeffy Glover.

2578
02:19:06.68 --> 02:19:09.68
If you notice, like, the belt is a little bit long.

2579
02:19:09.68 --> 02:19:10.68
It's fun.

2580
02:19:10.68 --> 02:19:11.68
Oh, yeah, because I'm thicker than he is.

2581
02:19:11.68 --> 02:19:14.68
Yeah, well, you have like a, you know, the belt comes in three.

2582
02:19:14.68 --> 02:19:14.68
Yeah.

2583
02:19:14.68 --> 02:19:16.68
And he's probably he's an A1 for sure.

2584
02:19:16.68 --> 02:19:17.68
Because of 55.

2585
02:19:17.68 --> 02:19:18.68
Yeah.

2586
02:19:18.68 --> 02:19:19.68
There it is.

2587
02:19:19.68 --> 02:19:20.68
So don't do that.

2588
02:19:20.68 --> 02:19:21.68
Don't worry guys.

2589
02:19:21.68 --> 02:19:22.68
There's a guy at Seal team.

2590
02:19:22.68 --> 02:19:27.68
And two who's a just incredibly well-respected guy in the day.

2591
02:19:27.68 --> 02:19:31.68
And he had, I think he had two sons.

2592
02:19:31.68 --> 02:19:36.68
And he was giving him like a hat, like a seal team, two hat or something that had

2593
02:19:36.68 --> 02:19:37.68
a tried on it.

2594
02:19:37.68 --> 02:19:38.68
Mm-hmm.

2595
02:19:38.68 --> 02:19:40.68
Well, he had an old one that he was going to give him two sons.

2596
02:19:40.68 --> 02:19:41.68
Okay, I'm not going to wear this in his two old.

2597
02:19:41.68 --> 02:19:44.68
And he made them cut the tried-in off of it.

2598
02:19:44.68 --> 02:19:45.68
If they wanted to wear it.

2599
02:19:45.68 --> 02:19:46.68
Ha ha.

2600
02:19:46.68 --> 02:19:47.68
I was like, yes.

2601
02:19:47.68 --> 02:19:48.68
Yeah, that's true.

2602
02:19:48.68 --> 02:19:49.68
I dig it.

2603
02:19:49.68 --> 02:19:50.68
And there's all those kinds of things.

2604
02:19:50.68 --> 02:19:55.68
You know, like if even on a super low or level, like, you know, if you made it through some

2605
02:19:55.68 --> 02:19:59.68
little thing, like, I don't know, like one of these Spartan races or something.

2606
02:19:59.68 --> 02:20:00.68
Yeah.

2607
02:20:00.68 --> 02:20:02.68
You only get this shirt or hat if you did it.

2608
02:20:02.68 --> 02:20:03.68
Yeah.

2609
02:20:03.68 --> 02:20:04.68
You know.

2610
02:20:04.68 --> 02:20:07.68
And even then there's a little, I mean, it's way more loose for sure.

2611
02:20:07.68 --> 02:20:10.68
But, you know, like your wife puts it on or something.

2612
02:20:10.68 --> 02:20:12.68
People like that do that.

2613
02:20:12.68 --> 02:20:13.68
Yeah, man.

2614
02:20:13.68 --> 02:20:14.68
I know my daughter, I know my daughter,

2615
02:20:14.68 --> 02:20:16.68
I represent that state.

2616
02:20:16.68 --> 02:20:17.68
It's the day wrestling champion.

2617
02:20:17.68 --> 02:20:18.68
Oh, yes.

2618
02:20:18.68 --> 02:20:21.68
Let's get up there. They're buying those shirts and sweatshirts.

2619
02:20:21.68 --> 02:20:25.68
It's like, you got read about what if you came home in your wife had your try it on?

2620
02:20:25.68 --> 02:20:26.68
Why would my wife have such a...

2621
02:20:26.68 --> 02:20:28.68
Just because she's trying to represent.

2622
02:20:28.68 --> 02:20:30.68
Oh, just taking from her.

2623
02:20:30.68 --> 02:20:35.68
No, actually, there's a thing where there's a thing where, like, I seal,

2624
02:20:35.68 --> 02:20:38.68
will give his wife like a little necklace with a try it on it.

2625
02:20:38.68 --> 02:20:39.68
Yeah.

2626
02:20:39.68 --> 02:20:40.68
Okay. You know, that's sort of there.

2627
02:20:40.68 --> 02:20:42.68
Why, so she doesn't take his.

2628
02:20:42.68 --> 02:20:44.68
No, I don't think she'd be trying to take his,

2629
02:20:44.68 --> 02:20:47.68
but I think it's just, you know, little appreciation.

2630
02:20:47.68 --> 02:20:48.68
Yeah, fully.

2631
02:20:48.68 --> 02:20:50.68
But no, but no, my, uh,

2632
02:20:50.68 --> 02:20:51.68
her wife knows what's up.

2633
02:20:51.68 --> 02:20:53.68
Yeah, no, my wife does not want to those.

2634
02:20:53.68 --> 02:20:54.68
Yeah.

2635
02:20:54.68 --> 02:20:55.68
I know she doesn't.

2636
02:20:55.68 --> 02:20:56.68
Makes sense.

2637
02:20:56.68 --> 02:20:57.68
So that's kind of how it is, right?

2638
02:20:57.68 --> 02:21:00.68
With the shirts from Jocco store kind of,

2639
02:21:00.68 --> 02:21:03.68
I mean, not to that level, but I put it this way.

2640
02:21:03.68 --> 02:21:06.68
If I see someone wearing representing,

2641
02:21:06.68 --> 02:21:08.68
I know that they're representing.

2642
02:21:08.68 --> 02:21:09.68
I know they're on the path for you there.

2643
02:21:09.68 --> 02:21:11.68
They're not just some guy who,

2644
02:21:11.68 --> 02:21:14.68
person or whatever, that's not on the path.

2645
02:21:14.68 --> 02:21:15.68
It doesn't seem like that.

2646
02:21:15.68 --> 02:21:17.68
They're definitely in the game. Yeah.

2647
02:21:17.68 --> 02:21:18.68
Yeah.

2648
02:21:18.68 --> 02:21:19.68
They're definitely in the game.

2649
02:21:19.68 --> 02:21:20.68
That's what a beautiful.

2650
02:21:20.68 --> 02:21:21.68
Sure.

2651
02:21:21.68 --> 02:21:22.68
Boom.

2652
02:21:22.68 --> 02:21:23.68
There you go.

2653
02:21:23.68 --> 02:21:24.68
Also, subscribe to the podcast.

2654
02:21:24.68 --> 02:21:25.68
If you haven't already.

2655
02:21:25.68 --> 02:21:30.68
I know seems obvious, but apparently it's not as obvious from what I gather.

2656
02:21:30.68 --> 02:21:32.68
Unless subscribe if you haven't already.

2657
02:21:32.68 --> 02:21:33.68
Yeah.

2658
02:21:33.68 --> 02:21:35.68
And by the way, that's if you get a piece of gear,

2659
02:21:35.68 --> 02:21:37.68
it supports the podcast.

2660
02:21:37.68 --> 02:21:38.68
Is that important?

2661
02:21:38.68 --> 02:21:40.68
Well, is it important?

2662
02:21:40.68 --> 02:21:42.68
It depends on what you mean by important.

2663
02:21:42.68 --> 02:21:43.68
So yes.

2664
02:21:43.68 --> 02:21:44.68
Yeah.

2665
02:21:44.68 --> 02:21:54.68
To let people know that the one additional bonus of representing is you're actually helping out the podcast support.

2666
02:21:54.68 --> 02:21:56.68
We're going to get a new table, by the way.

2667
02:21:56.68 --> 02:21:57.68
No, yeah.

2668
02:21:57.68 --> 02:21:58.68
Which has been a wonder.

2669
02:21:58.68 --> 02:22:00.68
Yeah, this one is ridiculous.

2670
02:22:00.68 --> 02:22:01.68
Yeah.

2671
02:22:01.68 --> 02:22:02.68
Echo Charles is table.

2672
02:22:02.68 --> 02:22:10.68
Well, this is one of those things where like an apt punishment would be you had to bring this to your house and use it as your dining room table for a year.

2673
02:22:10.68 --> 02:22:11.68
Oh my gosh.

2674
02:22:11.68 --> 02:22:15.68
Yeah.

2675
02:22:15.68 --> 02:22:16.68
Yeah.

2676
02:22:16.68 --> 02:22:18.68
I think this is a good day.

2677
02:22:18.68 --> 02:22:21.68
You know, the picture looked nice.

2678
02:22:21.68 --> 02:22:22.68
Sure.

2679
02:22:22.68 --> 02:22:23.68
All right.

2680
02:22:23.68 --> 02:22:24.68
So we're going to get a new table.

2681
02:22:24.68 --> 02:22:27.68
If you buy a t-shirt, we can get a new table that's not going to fall down.

2682
02:22:27.68 --> 02:22:29.68
You know, that, but we appreciate that support too.

2683

It looks okay.

2704
02:23:09.68 --> 02:23:10.68
I can't see it in that.

2705
02:23:10.68 --> 02:23:11.68
You can't really see it.

02:23:11.68 --> 02:23:12.68
Yeah.

02:23:13.68 --> 02:23:14.68
Yeah.

Canvases and vinyl posters that you can hang up.

2731
02:24:08.68 --> 02:24:10.68
And you can remind yourself the discipline equals freedom.

2732
02:24:10.68 --> 02:24:14.68
You can remind yourself that all your excuses are lies.

2733
02:24:14.68 --> 02:24:15.68
Yeah.

2734
02:24:15.68 --> 02:24:20.68
Well, that's really good because a lot of people were and we have posters for sure on, you know, the store.

2735
02:24:20.68 --> 02:24:26.68
But this is a little bit, it's like one, maybe like three or four levels better than, you know, a poster.

2736
02:24:26.68 --> 02:24:26.68
Yeah.

02:25:35.68 --> 02:25:40.68
If you want to help me and you want the book, please pre-order it so that I know how many

2769
02:25:40.68 --> 02:25:41.68
Deprint.

2770
02:25:41.68 --> 02:25:44.68
I failed miserably when it came to Mikey in the dragons.

2771
02:25:44.68 --> 02:25:45.68
Mikey in the dragons.

2772
02:25:45.68 --> 02:25:46.68
I didn't make enough.

2773
02:25:46.68 --> 02:25:49.68
I ended up having a scramble to make more.

2774
02:25:49.68 --> 02:25:50.68
I apologize.

2775
02:25:50.68 --> 02:25:55.68
We got him to everyone by Christmas, but it was, uh, it was not smooth.

2776
02:25:55.68 --> 02:25:59.68
It was a little bit of a nightbar, total failure on my part this time.

2777
02:25:59.68 --> 02:26:02.68
Way the warrior kid three where there's a will.

2778
02:26:02.68 --> 02:26:05.68
Check out that book pre-order it.

2779
02:26:05.68 --> 02:26:08.68
Now it's coming out May 28th by the way.

2780
02:26:08.68 --> 02:26:10.68
So we're almost there.

2781
02:26:10.68 --> 02:26:13.68
But I can make more quickly.

2782
02:26:13.68 --> 02:26:17.68
Quickly enough to have him ready for you if you pre-order it.

2783
02:26:17.68 --> 02:26:19.68
Anyways, also the way the warrior kid and marks mission.

2784
02:26:19.68 --> 02:26:21.68
Those are the first two books in that series.

2785
02:26:21.68 --> 02:26:26.68
Mikey in the dragons best book ever for little kids in the history of ever.

2786
02:26:26.68 --> 02:26:28.68
That's confirmed by the way.

2787
02:26:28.68 --> 02:26:33.68
And the field manual, the discipline equals pre-imfield manual.

2788
02:26:33.68 --> 02:26:38.68
That's a book about how to get after it no matter where you are in your life.

2789
02:26:38.68 --> 02:26:40.68
It's a great place to start.

2790
02:26:40.68 --> 02:26:41.68
Or to keep you.

2791
02:26:41.68 --> 02:26:43.68
To start on the path or to keep you on the path.

2792
02:26:43.68 --> 02:26:46.68
The audio version of that is on iTunes.

2793
02:26:46.68 --> 02:26:48.68
Amazon, music, Google Play.

2794
02:26:48.68 --> 02:26:49.68
Extreme ownership.

2795
02:26:49.68 --> 02:26:51.68
First book I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.

2796
02:26:51.68 --> 02:26:53.68
The dichotomy of leadership.

2797
02:26:53.68 --> 02:26:55.68
Second book I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.

2798
02:26:55.68 --> 02:26:56.68
Ashillan front.

2799
02:26:56.68 --> 02:26:58.68
That's our leadership consultancy.

2800
02:26:58.68 --> 02:27:00.68
We solve problems through leadership.

2801
02:27:00.68 --> 02:27:01.68
That's what we do.

2802
02:27:01.68 --> 02:27:03.68
Go to echelonfront.com.

2803
02:27:03.68 --> 02:27:04.68

02:27:04.68 --> 02:27:06.68
May 23rd and 24th.

2805
02:27:06.68 --> 02:27:07.68
Sold out.

2806
02:27:07.68 --> 02:27:08.68
Done.

2807
02:27:08.68 --> 02:27:10.68
That's in Chicago.

2808
02:27:10.68 --> 02:27:12.68
September 19th and 20th.

2809
02:27:12.68 --> 02:27:14.68
In Denver, that one is going to set out.

2810
02:27:14.68 --> 02:27:16.68
So is Sydney, December 4th and 5th.

2811
02:27:16.68 --> 02:27:17.68
If you want to come to the monster.

2812
02:27:17.68 --> 02:27:19.68
Extreme ownership.com.

2813
02:27:19.68 --> 02:27:21.68
That's where the details are.

2814
02:27:21.68 --> 02:27:22.68
They're all going to sell out.

2815
02:27:22.68 --> 02:27:25.68
All them have sold out and all them will sell out.

2816
02:27:25.68 --> 02:27:27.68
So if you want to come.

2817
02:27:27.68 --> 02:27:29.68
Get on there and get registered.

2818
02:27:29.68 --> 02:27:30.68
EF online.

2819
02:27:30.68 --> 02:27:31.68
I already talked about that.

2820
02:27:31.68 --> 02:27:37.68
The EF Overwatch is where we take leaders from special operations from combat aviation.

2821
02:27:37.68 --> 02:27:41.68
And we place them into companies that need leadership inside their organization.

2822
02:27:41.68 --> 02:27:46.68
So you know, it's going to hire someone just because they've been working in some industry for a long time.

2823
02:27:46.68 --> 02:27:47.68
And some industry for a long time.

2824
02:27:47.68 --> 02:27:52.68
Higher someone that has leadership capability and then get them up to speed on the industry.

2825
02:27:52.68 --> 02:27:54.68
These guys are proven combat leaders.

2826
02:27:54.68 --> 02:27:57.68
They can step up and take you to the place you need.

2827
02:27:57.68 --> 02:27:59.68
EF Overwatch.com.

2828
02:27:59.68 --> 02:28:03.68
And if you want to cruise with us.

2829
02:28:03.68 --> 02:28:04.68
Hardcore.

2830
02:28:04.68 --> 02:28:05.68
By the way, hardcore cruising.

2831
02:28:05.68 --> 02:28:08.68
Which is my recommended level of cruising.

2832
02:28:08.68 --> 02:28:10.68
From time to time, rest between sets.

2833
02:28:10.68 --> 02:28:12.68
We're on the inner webs.

2834
02:28:12.68 --> 02:28:13.68
Twitter, Instagram.

2835
02:28:13.68 --> 02:28:15.68
And on Facebook.

2836
02:28:15.68 --> 02:28:17.68
That was going to do like you did.

2837
02:28:17.68 --> 02:28:20.68
Anyway, I'm at Echo Charles.

2838
02:28:20.68 --> 02:28:24.68
And Jockel's at Jockel Willink on all of them.

2839
02:28:24.68 --> 02:28:30.68
And thanks to all our military folks out there that are on the front lines of freedom,

2840
02:28:30.68 --> 02:28:35.68
standing watch and thanks to police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,

2841
02:28:35.68 --> 02:28:42.68
EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service.

2842
02:28:42.68 --> 02:28:49.68
And all first responders who maintain vigilance 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to keep us safe.

2843
02:28:49.68 --> 02:28:54.68
Here at home into everyone else out there.

2844
02:28:54.68 --> 02:29:00.68
Remember some of those lessons from Field Marshall Montgomery.

2845
02:29:00.68 --> 02:29:11.68
Remember to cut through the overlying difficulties and see the essentials of what you need to do.

2846
02:29:11.68 --> 02:29:21.68
And then take a dispatch and a dispatch and a view of good things and bad things that are going to assail you.

2847
02:29:21.68 --> 02:29:29.68
And use your force of will to keep getting after it.

2848
02:29:29.68 --> 02:29:42.68
And until next time, this is Echo and Jockel. Out.
