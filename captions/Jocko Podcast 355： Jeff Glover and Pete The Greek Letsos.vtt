00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16
This is Jocko podcast number 355 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:05.60
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:05.60 --> 00:00:06.44
Good evening Echo.

4
00:00:06.44 --> 00:00:07.28
Good evening.

5
00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:12.28
So it was about 2009 or 2010, I think.

6
00:00:14.20 --> 00:00:18.28
And I'm in San Diego and that year in San Diego,

7
00:00:18.28 --> 00:00:23.28
whatever year this was, the ADCC trials were in San Diego.

8
00:00:23.80 --> 00:00:27.76
So this is the championship of Jiu Jitsu,

9
00:00:27.76 --> 00:00:31.40
of submission grappling and you have to do,

10
00:00:31.40 --> 00:00:33.88
you have to get qualified to go there

11
00:00:33.88 --> 00:00:36.24
and they have a bunch of competitions all over the world

12
00:00:36.24 --> 00:00:40.24
and the North American qualifier happened to be in San Diego.

13
00:00:40.24 --> 00:00:43.64
So I went of course and I brought my son with me.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So I got my son with me and he's like seven or eight years

15
00:00:50.16 --> 00:00:53.60
old but he trains all the time so he knows what's up.

16
00:00:53.60 --> 00:00:57.20
And they announce who's next up in this one mat

17
00:00:57.20 --> 00:00:59.92
and they go, oh, next up is gonna be some,

18
00:00:59.92 --> 00:01:04.64
blah, blah, blah, some guy versus Jeff Glover.

19
00:01:04.64 --> 00:01:07.000
And I was like, I told my son, I looked at him, I go,

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.32
hey, I go, this guy, we're going to that mat

21
00:01:11.32 --> 00:01:12.64
to watch this guy, Jeff Glover.

22
00:01:12.64 --> 00:01:14.32
I said, he's crazy.

23
00:01:15.44 --> 00:01:19.000
And so we run over to that mat, we start watching

24
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.60
and sure enough, this guy, Jeff Glover.

25
00:01:21.60 --> 00:01:24.56
And I knew Jeff Glover because we started competing

26
00:01:24.56 --> 00:01:25.64
in Jiu Jitsu around the same time.

27
00:01:25.64 --> 00:01:30.36
As a matter of fact, I have a sheet of paper

28
00:01:30.36 --> 00:01:35.36
that has the champions of like grappling games

29
00:01:36.16 --> 00:01:37.88
or one of these old school, Joe Morier,

30
00:01:37.88 --> 00:01:40.24
one of these old school Jiu Jitsu tournaments

31
00:01:40.24 --> 00:01:43.88
and the first place winner of the white belts is Jeff Glover.

32
00:01:43.88 --> 00:01:47.48
The first place winner of the blue belts is me

33
00:01:47.48 --> 00:01:49.12
and then Dean Lister's like the purple belt

34
00:01:49.12 --> 00:01:52.56
or something along those lines, but it's pretty cool, right?

35
00:01:52.56 --> 00:01:54.88
So anyways, Jeff Glover comes out and what does he do?

36
00:01:54.88 --> 00:01:59.20
He like, does donkey guard, which means he basically

37
00:01:59.20 --> 00:02:02.12
turns his back on his opponent, goes on all fours,

38
00:02:02.12 --> 00:02:06.68
runs at the dude backwards and engages him

39
00:02:06.68 --> 00:02:08.48
and then 14 seconds later, he's got the guy

40
00:02:08.48 --> 00:02:10.08
and he'll hook in the guy taps.

41
00:02:11.04 --> 00:02:14.12
And my son, who again, he's like seven or eight years old,

42
00:02:14.12 --> 00:02:15.72
he looks at me and he goes,

43
00:02:17.20 --> 00:02:20.56
when you said he was crazy, I thought you meant crazy.

44
00:02:20.56 --> 00:02:25.12
Ah, I didn't know you meant crazy.

45
00:02:26.56 --> 00:02:27.40
So that was it.

46
00:02:27.40 --> 00:02:32.40
That was kind of a moment in that I really remember

47
00:02:32.48 --> 00:02:35.60
about Jeff Glover and then luckily for me

48
00:02:35.60 --> 00:02:37.88
and luckily for everyone in San Diego,

49
00:02:37.88 --> 00:02:41.20
Jeff Glover came down and actually taught Jiu Jitsu

50
00:02:41.20 --> 00:02:45.24
at Victory MMA for five years.

51
00:02:45.24 --> 00:02:49.08
For five years we had Jeff Glover here teaching.

52
00:02:49.08 --> 00:02:53.44
Jeff Glover, he ended up, he's done all kinds of stuff.

53
00:02:53.44 --> 00:02:57.28

27 time champion of grapplers' quests.

56
00:03:06.56 --> 00:03:09.08
Maybe it's more, but a lot.

00:03:09.08 --> 00:03:13.68
27 times champion of grapplers' quest

58
00:03:13.68 --> 00:03:18.20

60
00:03:20.40 --> 00:03:21.60

which who you probably don't know.

65
00:03:29.52 --> 00:03:31.52
You probably don't know who Pete Lettsoce is,

66
00:03:31.52 --> 00:03:34.12
but that's okay, you might know who Pete the Greek is.

Thanks, I call.

84
00:04:27.96 --> 00:04:29.08
Thanks, Jeff.

85
00:04:29.08 --> 00:04:32.52
So here we are, two Jiu Jitsu legends in the house.

86
00:04:32.52 --> 00:04:35.96
Nice for me, you know, I love Jiu Jitsu.

87
00:04:35.96 --> 00:04:37.08
I love Jiu Jitsu.

88
00:04:37.08 --> 00:04:38.76
And so it's nice for me to come in here

89
00:04:38.76 --> 00:04:40.80
and just be able to talk about Jiu Jitsu.

90
00:04:40.80 --> 00:04:41.68
But let's talk about you guys

91
00:04:41.68 --> 00:04:44.88
and how you guys got started in the game.

92
00:04:44.88 --> 00:04:48.16
Jeff, so tell us a little bit like where'd you grow up?

93
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.76
What'd your parents, what'd your parents do?

94
00:04:51.76 --> 00:04:55.56
My mom was a nurse and my dad had all kinds of different jobs

95
00:04:55.56 --> 00:04:59.04
and they ended up in Santa Barbara,

96
00:04:59.04 --> 00:05:00.96
which is where I found Jiu Jitsu.

97
00:05:00.96 --> 00:05:03.000
Like 16 I started.

98
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.52
You were 16 when you started.

99
00:05:04.52 --> 00:05:05.88
And everyone thought I was like 12.

100
00:05:05.88 --> 00:05:07.88
Yeah, cause you still look like you're 16 now.

101
00:05:07.88 --> 00:05:12.04
I'm wearing a beautiful face, thank you.

102
00:05:12.04 --> 00:05:13.84
What, how'd you get to the gym?

103
00:05:13.84 --> 00:05:15.08
What happened?

104
00:05:15.08 --> 00:05:20.08
Well, Francia actually moved next door to my mom's house.

105
00:05:20.80 --> 00:05:23.000
Him and his whole Brazilian family.

106
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.72
There was like 12 of them.

107
00:05:24.72 --> 00:05:26.48
They all moved into a house together.

108
00:05:26.48 --> 00:05:28.32
And like next door neighbors?

109
00:05:28.32 --> 00:05:30.16
Yeah, like right there.

110
00:05:30.16 --> 00:05:32.24
The same block that Bill Cooper lived on.

111
00:05:33.56 --> 00:05:36.96
And Bill wasn't even in the scene yet,

112
00:05:36.96 --> 00:05:39.40
but he lived in that neighborhood and was one of the kids.

113
00:05:39.40 --> 00:05:41.60
But yeah, Francia.

114
00:05:41.60 --> 00:05:42.84
So then when he came over and was like,

115
00:05:42.84 --> 00:05:44.12
you needed to learn how to fight, boy?

116
00:05:44.12 --> 00:05:46.80
I went over there to make friends, you know,

117
00:05:46.80 --> 00:05:48.12
and knocked on their door.

118
00:05:48.12 --> 00:05:49.76
That's kind of how it was in that neighborhood.

119
00:05:49.76 --> 00:05:51.68
You know, like it was a nice spot.

120
00:05:51.68 --> 00:05:53.04
It was a nice place to live.

121
00:05:53.04 --> 00:05:57.12
And yeah, I knocked on the door, he opened the door

122
00:05:57.12 --> 00:06:01.28
and like he had a TV playing UFC in the background.

123
00:06:01.28 --> 00:06:02.24
What year is this?

124
00:06:02.24 --> 00:06:04.12
I mean, this was like 1998.

125
00:06:04.12 --> 00:06:04.96
Okay.

126
00:06:04.96 --> 00:06:07.000
1998 or nine.

127
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.32
And yeah, it was just super crazy.

128
00:06:09.32 --> 00:06:11.52
Like he had, you know, the cauliflower,

129
00:06:11.52 --> 00:06:13.16
the shaved head, it's intimidating.

130
00:06:13.16 --> 00:06:14.88
You know, you remember the first time you saw

131
00:06:14.88 --> 00:06:18.24
a really good grappler and the way their head

132
00:06:18.24 --> 00:06:21.24
just kind of looks different, you know, in the ears.

133
00:06:21.24 --> 00:06:22.24
How did that happen?

134
00:06:24.08 --> 00:06:26.40
So did he say like, I teach Jiu-Jitsu,

135
00:06:26.40 --> 00:06:27.84
you're like, what is that karate?

136
00:06:27.84 --> 00:06:29.08
Like I don't want to do karate.

137
00:06:29.08 --> 00:06:30.40
That looks, you know, kind of way.

138
00:06:30.40 --> 00:06:32.16
I mean, I didn't understand a word he said

139
00:06:32.16 --> 00:06:33.80
for the first six months.

140
00:06:33.80 --> 00:06:36.72
All I know is he was just very persuasive

141
00:06:36.72 --> 00:06:38.68
and was pulling and pushing me places.

142
00:06:38.68 --> 00:06:41.72
And I found myself on a mat with people trying to choke me.

143
00:06:41.72 --> 00:06:43.32
And it was awesome.

144
00:06:43.32 --> 00:06:45.32
And then how long was it before you were like

145
00:06:45.32 --> 00:06:46.96
in the Academy taking classes?

146
00:06:47.88 --> 00:06:50.12
Like the first week, that first week.

147
00:06:50.12 --> 00:06:52.32
After that first week, I like told him, I was like,

148
00:06:52.32 --> 00:06:54.32
dude, I want to do what you do.

149
00:06:54.32 --> 00:06:57.20
How long did it, did you realize the power of Jiu-Jitsu

150
00:06:57.20 --> 00:06:58.04
immediately?

151
00:06:58.04 --> 00:07:00.32
Were you just like, why is this happening?

152
00:07:00.32 --> 00:07:02.56
It didn't really, it didn't like dawn on me.

153
00:07:02.56 --> 00:07:05.92
None of that profound stuff was dawning on me.

154
00:07:05.92 --> 00:07:10.28
It was just so cool to have this like mentor guy

155
00:07:10.28 --> 00:07:12.80
telling me what to do that was like telling me

156
00:07:12.80 --> 00:07:14.40
to do pushups and yelling.

157
00:07:14.40 --> 00:07:16.20
Like, you know, he would kick me if I didn't do

158
00:07:16.20 --> 00:07:18.52
the calisthenics work he wanted me to do.

159
00:07:18.52 --> 00:07:20.60
You know, like I'd never had that in my life.

160
00:07:20.60 --> 00:07:22.16
And I was like, I didn't care what it was.

161
00:07:22.16 --> 00:07:24.16
If that dude was jumping off bridges,

162
00:07:24.16 --> 00:07:25.76
I would have jumped off bridges.

163
00:07:25.76 --> 00:07:28.32
But that dude did Jiu-Jitsu tournaments on the weekend

164
00:07:28.32 --> 00:07:30.32
and pushups during the week.

165
00:07:30.32 --> 00:07:33.20
So that's, you know, it was just really nice.

166
00:07:33.20 --> 00:07:33.72
Yeah.

167
00:07:33.72 --> 00:07:36.04
Did he open that Academy immediately?

168
00:07:36.04 --> 00:07:37.52
This is by the way, if anybody wants to know,

169
00:07:37.52 --> 00:07:39.36
this is Paragon Jiu-Jitsu.

170
00:07:39.36 --> 00:07:43.20
This is, this is Ricardo Franjia Miller,

171
00:07:43.20 --> 00:07:45.80
like epic instructor.

172
00:07:45.80 --> 00:07:48.88
And you know, obviously he has Jeff Glover under him,

173
00:07:48.88 --> 00:07:52.44
has Bill Cooper under him, has the other Glover

174
00:07:52.44 --> 00:07:54.60
under him, Tyrone Glover.

175
00:07:54.60 --> 00:07:58.60
So he's made a bunch of just incredible Jiu-Jitsu people.

176
00:07:58.60 --> 00:07:59.92
He's still up there at Paragon.

177
00:07:59.92 --> 00:08:00.40
Yeah.

178
00:08:00.40 --> 00:08:05.44
He has a big empire that he runs and operates out of Ventura

179
00:08:05.44 --> 00:08:06.64
and all over.

180
00:08:06.64 --> 00:08:07.92
My middle ghost.

181
00:08:07.92 --> 00:08:10.40
My middle daughter is now part of the Paragon empire

182
00:08:10.40 --> 00:08:12.36
because she goes to Slo.

183
00:08:12.36 --> 00:08:13.44
Yeah, Chris Lovato.

184
00:08:13.44 --> 00:08:17.40
He was one of the first guys that came into Franjia's

185
00:08:17.40 --> 00:08:21.08
Jiu-Jitsu world with like really good wrestling.

186
00:08:21.08 --> 00:08:26.24
And I used to fight Chris Lovato when I was like 17, 16, 17, 18.

187
00:08:26.24 --> 00:08:28.96
I was like one of the first like men Franjia would let me like

188
00:08:28.96 --> 00:08:29.96
fight.

189
00:08:29.96 --> 00:08:30.96
You know what I'm saying?

190
00:08:30.96 --> 00:08:33.64
And I got some good work out of that dude.

191
00:08:33.64 --> 00:08:36.72
Is that where you started developing good wrestling?

192
00:08:36.72 --> 00:08:40.20
Yeah, him and Tyrone, Tyrone came in, was like, all right,

193
00:08:40.20 --> 00:08:42.28
all these Brazilian names, all these judo names

194
00:08:42.28 --> 00:08:43.48
that you have for these takedowns,

195
00:08:43.48 --> 00:08:45.24
there's wrestling names for those too.

196
00:08:45.24 --> 00:08:46.68
You know, like double legs.

197
00:08:46.68 --> 00:08:48.72
That's not called Bayana, right?

198
00:08:48.72 --> 00:08:49.88
Is that what they called it?

199
00:08:49.88 --> 00:08:50.68
That's not called Bayana.

200
00:08:50.68 --> 00:08:52.44
That's called double leg.

201
00:08:52.44 --> 00:08:55.16
And he's like, and you change levels when you do it too.

202
00:08:55.16 --> 00:08:58.56
You don't just like, band over and grab it.

203
00:08:58.56 --> 00:08:59.80
And yeah, that was it.

204
00:08:59.80 --> 00:09:01.92
I started wrestling early, early, early.

205
00:09:01.92 --> 00:09:02.76
Yeah.

206
00:09:02.76 --> 00:09:06.08
Yeah, your wrestling is like underrated, right?

207
00:09:06.08 --> 00:09:08.44
Because people, you're so fluid on the mat

208
00:09:08.44 --> 00:09:10.60
that people might not recognize that.

209
00:09:10.60 --> 00:09:14.64
And your freaking creativity on the mat is ridiculous.

210
00:09:14.64 --> 00:09:15.48
It's ridiculous.

211
00:09:15.48 --> 00:09:17.48
And we'll get into like where that came from.

212
00:09:17.48 --> 00:09:19.08
But before, Pete.

213
00:09:19.08 --> 00:09:19.56
Yes, sir.

214
00:09:19.56 --> 00:09:20.72
How'd it go down?

215
00:09:20.72 --> 00:09:22.92
Well, first of all, you're from Chi-Town, right?

216
00:09:22.92 --> 00:09:23.44
Yes.

217
00:09:23.44 --> 00:09:24.60
So tell us a little bit about that.

218
00:09:24.60 --> 00:09:25.16
What's going on?

219
00:09:25.16 --> 00:09:26.04
Where are you from?

220
00:09:26.04 --> 00:09:28.48
My dad owned hot dog places.

221
00:09:28.48 --> 00:09:31.08
My dad was the first one to have a Euro since Chicago.

222
00:09:31.08 --> 00:09:32.36
So he'd put it on the spit.

223
00:09:32.36 --> 00:09:35.000
And we basically would flip restaurants.

224
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.40
We'd flip hot dog places.

225
00:09:36.40 --> 00:09:38.28
Well, they're not a little standard.

226
00:09:38.28 --> 00:09:40.40
Like across the street at the malt shop.

227
00:09:40.40 --> 00:09:43.36
So it's basically those type of places, a little bit smaller.

228
00:09:43.36 --> 00:09:48.16
And so my dad would, we'd go and find a place.

229
00:09:48.16 --> 00:09:49.12
You know, we're Greek.

230
00:09:49.12 --> 00:09:52.08
We'd find someone struggling that they'd open them,

231
00:09:52.08 --> 00:09:53.000
not know how to do it.

232
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.84
And we'd just take it over and flip it.

233
00:09:54.84 --> 00:09:57.56
You could either flip it in a few months, maybe a few years.

234
00:09:57.56 --> 00:10:00.36
But one that we kept was called Kings and Queens.

235
00:10:00.36 --> 00:10:04.44
And that was in Burwin, which is right next to Chicago.

236
00:10:04.44 --> 00:10:05.76
It's right on the border.

237
00:10:05.76 --> 00:10:08.52
And there was a karate place next to it.

238
00:10:08.52 --> 00:10:10.08
So my dad, my dad's tough.

239
00:10:10.08 --> 00:10:12.40
He's from Greece.

240
00:10:12.40 --> 00:10:14.52
His parents left him at 13 years old.

241
00:10:14.52 --> 00:10:16.44
He took care of himself since 13.

242
00:10:16.44 --> 00:10:19.40
They brought him to the United States at World War II.

243
00:10:19.40 --> 00:10:22.72
As soon as that was over, he was born in that time.

244
00:10:22.72 --> 00:10:25.96
So he's born in 1942.

245
00:10:25.96 --> 00:10:27.40
They brought him over.

246
00:10:27.40 --> 00:10:28.76
And his dad's like, you know what?

247
00:10:28.76 --> 00:10:29.80
I'm out.

248
00:10:29.80 --> 00:10:31.80
And he left and has left them.

249
00:10:31.80 --> 00:10:33.32
And so then he made it to Chicago.

250
00:10:33.32 --> 00:10:34.20
And he's a tough guy.

251
00:10:34.20 --> 00:10:36.56
So he always wanted to like, but he worked hard.

252
00:10:36.56 --> 00:10:37.64
So he never really worked out.

253
00:10:37.64 --> 00:10:38.64
He's like, I never worked out.

254
00:10:38.64 --> 00:10:39.84
I just worked.

255
00:10:39.84 --> 00:10:42.56
And the karate place next to the place,

256
00:10:42.56 --> 00:10:44.56
and my dad got his black belt.

257
00:10:44.56 --> 00:10:47.04
And he would just do private lessons with the master

258
00:10:47.04 --> 00:10:47.68
and all that.

259
00:10:47.68 --> 00:10:49.44
And so my dad would train me when I was born.

260
00:10:49.44 --> 00:10:50.92
He had me at like at 40 years old.

261
00:10:50.92 --> 00:10:54.76
So he'd be on his knees and fight me all the time

262
00:10:54.76 --> 00:10:55.92
and make me tough.

263
00:10:55.92 --> 00:10:57.96
And I don't know where he learned that,

264
00:10:57.96 --> 00:10:59.28
but it was like war training.

265
00:10:59.28 --> 00:11:03.08
So I started doing that.

266
00:11:03.08 --> 00:11:06.52
And then I went to the karate place, but I didn't like it.

267
00:11:06.52 --> 00:11:08.40
I would just show up for the belt promotion.

268
00:11:08.40 --> 00:11:10.000
I'm like, oh, these kids are getting promoted.

269
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.12
I'll fight them.

270
00:11:11.12 --> 00:11:13.40
And then they'd get promoted, but they have to fight me.

271
00:11:13.40 --> 00:11:17.60
And the guy's like, look, man, you can't come back.

272
00:11:17.60 --> 00:11:18.84
You have to come to class.

273
00:11:18.84 --> 00:11:23.16
And I was good at floor hockey and baseball and stuff.

274
00:11:23.16 --> 00:11:26.64
And I found out that my cousin was like the best ice hockey

275
00:11:26.64 --> 00:11:26.88
player.

276
00:11:26.88 --> 00:11:27.80
His name's Chris Chagallos.

277
00:11:27.80 --> 00:11:29.60
He's one of the best ones.

278
00:11:29.60 --> 00:11:30.40
He's in the NHL.

279
00:11:30.40 --> 00:11:32.56
He lived in San Diego.

280
00:11:32.56 --> 00:11:36.36
And one of the kids was getting bullied.

281
00:11:36.36 --> 00:11:38.72
So the dad's like, no, no, we're going to teach you.

282
00:11:38.72 --> 00:11:40.52
And so they brought me on to ice hockey team.

283
00:11:40.52 --> 00:11:42.40
And I beat up the bully day one.

284
00:11:42.40 --> 00:11:45.36
I was never that big, but I was ready to fight people

285
00:11:45.36 --> 00:11:46.60
for my friends.

286
00:11:46.60 --> 00:11:48.88
And so bam.

287
00:11:48.88 --> 00:11:50.76
You still rated it for people for your sons.

288
00:11:50.76 --> 00:11:54.76
No, but Glover likes me.

289
00:11:54.76 --> 00:11:57.24
I really don't have to fight anyone, but it's just fun.

290
00:11:57.24 --> 00:11:58.48
It keeps you strong.

291
00:11:58.48 --> 00:12:02.60
And so next thing, what happened next?

292
00:12:02.60 --> 00:12:03.68
So what did you do to Glover?

293
00:12:03.68 --> 00:12:04.96
They brought me to ice hockey.

294
00:12:04.96 --> 00:12:07.12
So then ice hockey was cool, but I never really

295
00:12:07.12 --> 00:12:08.08
wanted to play ice hockey.

296
00:12:08.08 --> 00:12:10.76
They just want me there to beat up the bullies.

297
00:12:10.76 --> 00:12:12.32
So then bam, I saw UFC.

298
00:12:12.32 --> 00:12:13.80
It was like 1993 at my mom.

299
00:12:13.80 --> 00:12:16.88
I live at my mom growing up, my dad went back to Greece.

300
00:12:16.88 --> 00:12:21.48
And I looked at my mom and said, that's what I want to do.

301
00:12:21.48 --> 00:12:24.76
And she looked at me and was like, that's what you should do.

302
00:12:24.76 --> 00:12:26.80
That's the only mom in history.

303
00:12:26.80 --> 00:12:27.88
I was like, that looks good.

304
00:12:27.88 --> 00:12:28.72
I was like, this is perfect.

305
00:12:28.72 --> 00:12:29.96
So we just watch it.

306
00:12:29.96 --> 00:12:31.36
And we moved around.

307
00:12:31.36 --> 00:12:32.56
So I went to a few high schools.

308
00:12:32.56 --> 00:12:37.12
The last high school I went to, because we was called Montini.

309
00:12:37.12 --> 00:12:40.28
And they were really strong wrestling programs.

310
00:12:40.28 --> 00:12:43.52
So you see John Jones' wrestling coaches from there.

311
00:12:43.52 --> 00:12:45.04
They have like Izzy, Rusty, all these kids

312
00:12:45.04 --> 00:12:46.68
are top-notch wrestlers.

313
00:12:46.68 --> 00:12:49.76
And so I would go to wrestling rooms and fight them pretty much.

314
00:12:49.76 --> 00:12:52.60
I was like 14, 15.

315
00:12:52.60 --> 00:12:54.76
And I was able to do well against all of them.

316
00:12:54.76 --> 00:12:57.72
But I would never wrestle because it was ice hockey season.

317
00:12:57.72 --> 00:13:00.44
So then finally one of the Gracie's moved in town.

318
00:13:00.44 --> 00:13:03.04
And I couldn't drive yet.

319
00:13:03.04 --> 00:13:05.24
So then my mom's like, yeah.

320
00:13:05.24 --> 00:13:06.48
My mom had a heart attack.

321
00:13:06.48 --> 00:13:07.76
She still can't drive.

322
00:13:07.76 --> 00:13:09.08
My mom had a heart attack at 14.

323
00:13:09.08 --> 00:13:11.80
So I took the car, went to the Gracie's.

324
00:13:11.80 --> 00:13:14.28
And I met Carlson Gracie Jr. I'm like, whoa.

325
00:13:14.28 --> 00:13:17.92
I'm like, this guy's like, he's one of them.

326
00:13:17.92 --> 00:13:19.32
And then he didn't like to drive.

327
00:13:19.32 --> 00:13:21.60
So I became his personal driver.

328
00:13:21.60 --> 00:13:24.000
And then when I would drive him, people

329
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.36
want to kick my butt because I show up with the coach.

330
00:13:26.36 --> 00:13:28.04
I'm always with him.

331
00:13:28.04 --> 00:13:29.32
And then that's when I met Carlson.

332
00:13:29.32 --> 00:13:31.16
Carlson would bring VTOR and everyone.

333
00:13:31.16 --> 00:13:32.000
I was so happy.

334
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.12
I didn't even know there were Jiu-Jitsu tournaments.

335
00:13:34.12 --> 00:13:37.60
I just thought there was pride fighting and UFC.

336
00:13:37.60 --> 00:13:40.24
And then should I join?

337
00:13:40.24 --> 00:13:41.28
I became one of them.

338
00:13:41.28 --> 00:13:44.96
I came to the driver, just drove him everywhere.

339
00:13:44.96 --> 00:13:46.68
And then eventually.

340
00:13:46.68 --> 00:13:49.04
Eventually you went to Brazil, right?

341
00:13:49.04 --> 00:13:49.88
Yeah, eventually.

342
00:13:49.88 --> 00:13:51.04
How far along was that?

343
00:13:51.04 --> 00:13:53.60
So then there's a tournament going on.

344
00:13:53.60 --> 00:13:54.64
I lived in Ohio.

345
00:13:54.64 --> 00:13:57.48
So Carlson Gracie Jr. He was my best friend.

346
00:13:57.48 --> 00:14:00.08
He lived with me and he lived with me and my mom in Chicago.

347
00:14:00.08 --> 00:14:01.52
He lived alone.

348
00:14:01.52 --> 00:14:03.72
But you can't move from Rio de Janeiro to Chicago.

349
00:14:03.72 --> 00:14:05.28
It gets depressing.

350
00:14:05.28 --> 00:14:08.24
It's like I'm knocking on his door because my job

351
00:14:08.24 --> 00:14:11.20
was to pick him up and take him to class.

352
00:14:11.20 --> 00:14:12.40
Like people still have that.

353
00:14:12.40 --> 00:14:13.84
Like a lot of Jiu-Jitsu coaches, they

354
00:14:13.84 --> 00:14:16.12
love to have their students come, pick them up, hang out,

355
00:14:16.12 --> 00:14:17.56
and take them to class.

356
00:14:17.56 --> 00:14:20.64
So I'm knocking on the door and he's not answering.

357
00:14:20.64 --> 00:14:21.68
I kicked the door down.

358
00:14:21.68 --> 00:14:23.92
I'm like, look, come live with me and my mom.

359
00:14:23.92 --> 00:14:26.40
And then he lived with me and I started getting really serious

360
00:14:26.40 --> 00:14:27.04
about Jiu-Jitsu.

361
00:14:27.04 --> 00:14:29.12
I was about 16 at that point.

362
00:14:29.12 --> 00:14:30.16
What year was that?

363
00:14:30.16 --> 00:14:32.000
Around 96.

364
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.16
Somewhere around there, 96, 97.

365
00:14:34.16 --> 00:14:36.64
So now you're training freaking hard.

366
00:14:36.64 --> 00:14:37.28
Hard.

367
00:14:37.28 --> 00:14:38.24
So I'm his driver.

368
00:14:38.24 --> 00:14:39.92
I show up to every single class.

369
00:14:39.92 --> 00:14:41.96
It's Carlson Gracie team.

370
00:14:41.96 --> 00:14:44.84
So we always have people from Brazil.

371
00:14:44.84 --> 00:14:46.88
Carlson Gracie always come visit us

372
00:14:46.88 --> 00:14:49.52
because O'Hara Airport is international.

373
00:14:49.52 --> 00:14:52.12
So before things were different, they could stop.

374
00:14:52.12 --> 00:14:53.52
Well, I think they can still do that.

375
00:14:53.52 --> 00:14:54.92
But were anybody to go to Brazil,

376
00:14:54.92 --> 00:14:57.48
wherever they'd always bring their team and stop in Chicago

377
00:14:57.48 --> 00:14:59.96
and visit a son and have to fight them?

378
00:14:59.96 --> 00:15:03.12
And I didn't even know the returnments existed.

379
00:15:03.12 --> 00:15:05.32
I'm like, whoa, these guys make a lot of money.

380
00:15:05.32 --> 00:15:06.72
No one on my team was broke.

381
00:15:06.72 --> 00:15:09.32
You just seen Vitor come and eating metrics.

382
00:15:09.32 --> 00:15:11.04
Packages.

383
00:15:11.04 --> 00:15:12.56
You didn't even eat food.

384
00:15:12.56 --> 00:15:14.32
I was like, mom, I want to be like this guy.

385
00:15:14.32 --> 00:15:15.24
My dad looked at him.

386
00:15:15.24 --> 00:15:17.84
He's like, oh, my dad didn't understand so much

387
00:15:17.84 --> 00:15:18.92
because I didn't live with him.

388
00:15:18.92 --> 00:15:21.000
But my mom understood.

389
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.08
That's what I wanted to do.

390
00:15:22.08 --> 00:15:25.68
And so 110% behind me.

391
00:15:25.68 --> 00:15:27.92
And I never really had to pay for training.

392
00:15:27.92 --> 00:15:31.000
Because when you train like the way Jeff and I do,

393
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.48
first we start off cleaning them.

394
00:15:32.48 --> 00:15:34.84
First we start off usually is training dummies.

395
00:15:34.84 --> 00:15:36.36
We help with privates.

396
00:15:36.36 --> 00:15:38.16
We help with everything.

397
00:15:38.16 --> 00:15:39.72
So God bless all that.

398
00:15:39.72 --> 00:15:43.36
And I start training.

399
00:15:43.36 --> 00:15:45.12
Shoot, I end up in Brazil.

400
00:15:45.12 --> 00:15:48.60
Next thing you know, I'm at the tournament in Ohio.

401
00:15:48.60 --> 00:15:50.16
So it's my first day of the Purple Belt.

402
00:15:50.16 --> 00:15:51.32
I should go as a blue belt.

403
00:15:51.32 --> 00:15:52.80
And Carl Sreed Jr. says, look, you're

404
00:15:52.80 --> 00:15:53.96
going as a Purple Belt throughout.

405
00:15:53.96 --> 00:15:55.44
I'm like, oh, yeah.

406
00:15:55.44 --> 00:15:56.40
I show up there.

407
00:15:56.40 --> 00:15:57.88
And I smash everyone.

408
00:15:57.88 --> 00:15:59.76
I do a couple of over-under moves.

409
00:15:59.76 --> 00:16:02.48
And I smash a lot of pressure.

410
00:16:02.48 --> 00:16:04.16
I beat everyone.

411
00:16:04.16 --> 00:16:06.40
And then a guy comes out of the crowd.

412
00:16:06.40 --> 00:16:07.88
His name's Henry Metta Morales.

413
00:16:07.88 --> 00:16:08.80
He's back in the day.

414
00:16:08.80 --> 00:16:14.56
He fought Rafael Cadero in the old Valle Tudo things.

415
00:16:14.56 --> 00:16:16.36
He comes out.

416
00:16:16.36 --> 00:16:18.56
And he's like, I want to go against you.

417
00:16:18.56 --> 00:16:19.96
Because I beat a Pedro Sauer guy.

418
00:16:19.96 --> 00:16:21.96
He's from Pedro Sauer.

419
00:16:21.96 --> 00:16:25.64
And then, bam, I'm like, come on, let's do it.

420
00:16:25.64 --> 00:16:26.72
And then I beat him.

421
00:16:26.72 --> 00:16:28.08
Boom.

422
00:16:28.08 --> 00:16:28.92
And then on the whole crowd.

423
00:16:28.92 --> 00:16:30.20
How many hours a day were you training?

424
00:16:30.20 --> 00:16:31.32
No, all day.

425
00:16:31.32 --> 00:16:33.04
I would just pick them up.

426
00:16:33.04 --> 00:16:35.000
I was just there.

427
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.48
Jeff.

428
00:16:35.48 --> 00:16:36.28
He's a lifer.

429
00:16:36.28 --> 00:16:37.80
Jeff, how many hours a day?

430
00:16:37.80 --> 00:16:38.30
All day.

431
00:16:38.30 --> 00:16:40.20
Were you training once you started training?

432
00:16:40.20 --> 00:16:40.72
There's no hours.

433
00:16:40.72 --> 00:16:41.80
Not as much as Pete.

434
00:16:41.80 --> 00:16:42.60
Yeah, right.

435
00:16:42.60 --> 00:16:43.28
No way.

436
00:16:43.28 --> 00:16:44.08
He came after.

437
00:16:44.08 --> 00:16:44.92
Jeff came after.

438
00:16:44.92 --> 00:16:47.92
Because I met on the Met people in Brazil.

439
00:16:47.92 --> 00:16:50.76
And they had Scotty in them.

440
00:16:50.76 --> 00:16:54.84
And then so I had to train that hard because I wasn't accepted.

441
00:16:54.84 --> 00:16:55.92
My team destroyed.

442
00:16:55.92 --> 00:16:56.64
It fell apart.

443
00:16:56.64 --> 00:16:58.12
And so then I met Scotty.

444
00:16:58.12 --> 00:16:59.84
And Scotty had all the information.

445
00:16:59.84 --> 00:17:00.48
He had the digital cameras.

446
00:17:00.48 --> 00:17:01.16
OK, so hold on.

447
00:17:01.16 --> 00:17:04.80
You got Carlson Gracie team.

448
00:17:04.80 --> 00:17:07.96
Because a bunch of people left to make Brazilian top team, right?

449
00:17:07.96 --> 00:17:09.52
So I'm in this tournament in Ohio.

450
00:17:09.52 --> 00:17:15.20
And the coach is the referee is Cristiano Marcello.

451
00:17:15.20 --> 00:17:17.44
He's like the guy from Gracie Mitá.

452
00:17:17.44 --> 00:17:19.84
And he's coaching shoebox.

453
00:17:19.84 --> 00:17:21.44
He goes, tells Carlson to junior.

454
00:17:21.44 --> 00:17:24.80
This guy, if he moves to Brazil, no one will be able to beat him.

455
00:17:24.80 --> 00:17:26.04
They said that about you?

456
00:17:26.04 --> 00:17:28.80
Yeah, he was the ref when I won that.

457
00:17:28.80 --> 00:17:33.44
And so then, bam, I say to Juno, I said, I need to go to Brazil,

458
00:17:33.44 --> 00:17:33.92
dude.

459
00:17:33.92 --> 00:17:35.76
And he's like, sure, he's like, perfect.

460
00:17:35.76 --> 00:17:39.60
He calls his mom and I show up there on my backpack.

461
00:17:39.60 --> 00:17:40.16
And I'm like, what?

462
00:17:40.16 --> 00:17:41.52
What'd you tell your mom?

463
00:17:41.52 --> 00:17:43.12
I said, I'm going to my mom was happy.

464
00:17:43.12 --> 00:17:44.32
How old are you?

465
00:17:44.32 --> 00:17:45.76
I'm about 20.

466
00:17:45.76 --> 00:17:46.68
OK.

467
00:17:46.68 --> 00:17:47.76
My mom was happy.

468
00:17:47.76 --> 00:17:49.72
And what year is this?

469
00:17:49.72 --> 00:17:51.76
It's around 2000.

470
00:17:51.76 --> 00:17:52.56
Jack.

471
00:17:52.56 --> 00:17:52.96
OK.

472
00:17:52.96 --> 00:17:54.000
I go up and show up there.

473
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.72
And I'm in junior.

474
00:17:55.72 --> 00:17:58.16
It's like my brother Carlson Gracie junior.

475
00:17:58.16 --> 00:17:59.32
He lived with me and stuff.

476
00:17:59.32 --> 00:18:02.08
We're like close, like real close, like me and Jeff.

477
00:18:02.08 --> 00:18:03.08
The mom never met me.

478
00:18:03.08 --> 00:18:04.72
And she just gave me, I said, Peach.

479
00:18:04.72 --> 00:18:06.80
Because my name in Portuguese is like a dog.

480
00:18:06.80 --> 00:18:09.88
Like pit bull, pi, pi, she gives me a hug.

481
00:18:09.88 --> 00:18:11.04
I give her a hug.

482
00:18:11.04 --> 00:18:12.000
We didn't know any.

483
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.12
I couldn't understand anything.

484
00:18:13.12 --> 00:18:14.12
I knew some swear words.

485
00:18:14.12 --> 00:18:17.08
But so I show up.

486
00:18:17.08 --> 00:18:18.16
She works at the gym.

487
00:18:18.16 --> 00:18:19.84
Carlson's wife work at the gym 45.

488
00:18:19.84 --> 00:18:21.68
This is Jiu Jitsu crazy.

489
00:18:21.68 --> 00:18:22.64
So I walk over.

490
00:18:22.64 --> 00:18:23.72
They take me everywhere.

491
00:18:23.72 --> 00:18:24.80
This is Peach.

492
00:18:24.80 --> 00:18:25.56
Don't mess with them.

493
00:18:25.56 --> 00:18:27.76
And we meet all the bikers.

494
00:18:27.76 --> 00:18:31.04
They have all types of mutual friends that they know.

495
00:18:31.04 --> 00:18:33.68
They want to say, you know, this is Peach.

496
00:18:33.68 --> 00:18:35.12
Shoot.

497
00:18:35.12 --> 00:18:37.68
I was like, it was great.

498
00:18:37.68 --> 00:18:40.04
And then, yeah, but I showed up to the gym.

499
00:18:40.04 --> 00:18:42.64
And the third day they asked me to teach class.

500
00:18:42.64 --> 00:18:44.36
Because the team fell apart.

501
00:18:44.36 --> 00:18:46.000
And I was like, whoa.

502
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.16
Like I didn't come here for this.

503
00:18:48.16 --> 00:18:54.08
So then I tell Carlson, I'm like, look, I want to train hard.

504
00:18:54.08 --> 00:18:55.72
Because they only had a few guys left.

505
00:18:55.72 --> 00:18:57.08
Most of the guys had stayed left.

506
00:18:57.08 --> 00:18:58.32
Some were like the loyal guys.

507
00:18:58.32 --> 00:19:00.72
But some of the guys had no one wanted.

508
00:19:00.72 --> 00:19:04.04
It's like they didn't go with them because no one wanted them.

509
00:19:04.04 --> 00:19:06.40
So I was like, whoa.

510
00:19:06.40 --> 00:19:07.56
I'm like, I can't stay here.

511
00:19:07.56 --> 00:19:10.36
So did you feel like it was like a political scenario?

512
00:19:10.36 --> 00:19:11.20
It was like a war.

513
00:19:11.20 --> 00:19:13.48
It was like show up to a war after your team just got

514
00:19:13.48 --> 00:19:14.52
massacred.

515
00:19:14.52 --> 00:19:17.72
And they're just like, they're like, whoa.

516
00:19:17.72 --> 00:19:21.08
So what was it that made you not want?

517
00:19:21.08 --> 00:19:22.16
There was one guy there.

518
00:19:22.16 --> 00:19:23.48
There was a few left.

519
00:19:23.48 --> 00:19:25.24
So was it that all the good guys left?

520
00:19:25.24 --> 00:19:25.72
They all left.

521
00:19:25.72 --> 00:19:27.84
There was like two or three of us left.

522
00:19:27.84 --> 00:19:30.28
One of them was so tough.

523
00:19:30.28 --> 00:19:32.000
He was a biker guy.

524
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.68
I think he was like in the Hell's Angel or something.

525
00:19:34.68 --> 00:19:35.56
For sure he was.

526
00:19:35.56 --> 00:19:38.80
He went back to Brazilian top team to beat all them up

527
00:19:38.80 --> 00:19:40.72
and take them back.

528
00:19:40.72 --> 00:19:41.52
He was hectic.

529
00:19:41.52 --> 00:19:43.28
And he was doing a great job of doing that.

530
00:19:43.28 --> 00:19:44.40
But he got in trouble.

531
00:19:44.40 --> 00:19:46.88
And I don't know what happened to him.

532
00:19:46.88 --> 00:19:48.36
But he was actually doing it.

533
00:19:48.36 --> 00:19:51.96
He had one guy at the end willing to go there and beat them all

534
00:19:51.96 --> 00:19:53.08
up and take them back.

535
00:19:53.08 --> 00:19:54.60
And he was doing a good job of that.

536
00:19:54.60 --> 00:19:57.56
But it didn't work out.

537
00:19:57.56 --> 00:19:58.36
Things like that.

538
00:19:58.36 --> 00:20:04.24
Out of context, that whole idea of one guy going

539
00:20:04.24 --> 00:20:07.04
to another place beating people up and taking them back.

540
00:20:07.04 --> 00:20:07.96
I didn't know that.

541
00:20:07.96 --> 00:20:08.46
Yeah.

542
00:20:08.46 --> 00:20:09.96
It's Carlson Best from the name of Pocket.

543
00:20:09.96 --> 00:20:10.64
Street rules, son.

544
00:20:10.64 --> 00:20:11.80
The name is Pocket Tye.

545
00:20:11.80 --> 00:20:13.24
Well, actually I went through with Scotty.

546
00:20:13.24 --> 00:20:16.28
Scotty's like the American guy over there that films everything.

547
00:20:16.28 --> 00:20:17.52
Everyone loves him.

548
00:20:17.52 --> 00:20:19.32
But Scotty always has money around.

549
00:20:19.32 --> 00:20:22.68
So I show up to the Brazilian top team with Scotty one day.

550
00:20:22.68 --> 00:20:24.32
And he was like in enemy territory.

551
00:20:24.32 --> 00:20:24.96
I was like, whoa.

552
00:20:24.96 --> 00:20:26.56
I'm like, I saw all these guys.

553
00:20:26.56 --> 00:20:29.76
It was in the Bank of Brazil.

554
00:20:29.76 --> 00:20:32.24
Laborio's also worked for Bank of Brazil.

555
00:20:32.24 --> 00:20:36.44
So he hooked them up with, they had a country club where they trained.

556
00:20:36.44 --> 00:20:37.28
It was badass.

557
00:20:37.28 --> 00:20:38.04
I walked in there.

558
00:20:38.04 --> 00:20:38.72
I was like, whoa.

559
00:20:38.72 --> 00:20:40.84
There was like 80, 100 people.

560
00:20:40.84 --> 00:20:42.72
You seen like, I was like, whoa.

561
00:20:42.72 --> 00:20:45.36
And then the guy Navaliada, he was the guy with the tattoos.

562
00:20:45.36 --> 00:20:47.56
My best friend there.

563
00:20:47.56 --> 00:20:50.12
Well, because he was the last one left.

564
00:20:50.12 --> 00:20:53.40
He comes up and right away I'm in there.

565
00:20:53.40 --> 00:20:54.48
He stops the whole train.

566
00:20:54.48 --> 00:20:56.000
Because these guys are trying to sell his stuff.

567
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.20
I'm with a bunch of American dudes and the little guys from top teams.

568
00:21:00.20 --> 00:21:02.20
Like, oh, buy this, buy that.

569
00:21:02.20 --> 00:21:03.84
I'm like, what?

570
00:21:03.84 --> 00:21:07.12
I'm not buying no top team, nothing.

571
00:21:07.12 --> 00:21:08.28
And then Navaliada sees me.

572
00:21:08.28 --> 00:21:09.60
Pete's here.

573
00:21:09.60 --> 00:21:14.68
He's the only brother in the room that'll fight with me against all you guys.

574
00:21:14.68 --> 00:21:18.96
You assume everyone will come back to the Carlson Racing team.

575
00:21:18.96 --> 00:21:19.92
He got hectic in there.

576
00:21:19.92 --> 00:21:21.44
I was like, yeah.

577
00:21:21.44 --> 00:21:22.92
And then he's like, don't worry, Pete.

578
00:21:22.92 --> 00:21:24.12
I'm like, all right.

579
00:21:24.12 --> 00:21:25.92
And we just stood there.

580
00:21:25.92 --> 00:21:27.60
And that was when I went to the top team.

581
00:21:27.60 --> 00:21:31.48
And then it was never the same after that.

582
00:21:31.48 --> 00:21:33.08
I could never join them.

583
00:21:33.08 --> 00:21:35.44
So I went to all the other schools.

584
00:21:35.44 --> 00:21:40.16
Carlson said, look, I know you went there.

585
00:21:40.16 --> 00:21:41.64
He's like, you can't go there again.

586
00:21:41.64 --> 00:21:42.76
You can go anywhere else.

587
00:21:42.76 --> 00:21:44.40
So then I went to every other team.

588
00:21:44.40 --> 00:21:46.08
I showed up Gracie Baez, train.

589
00:21:46.08 --> 00:21:49.44
I lived in Oswaldo, I was I trained at Ted today.

590
00:21:49.44 --> 00:21:50.56
I went to every other gym.

591
00:21:50.56 --> 00:21:54.76
No one really liked me, but they respected Carlson, like you here like Gringo.

592
00:21:54.76 --> 00:21:55.80
I was like, you're great.

593
00:21:55.80 --> 00:21:56.72
I'm trying to hear Gringo.

594
00:21:56.72 --> 00:21:58.32
I'm like, all right.

595
00:21:58.32 --> 00:21:59.60
The Carlson Gracie.

596
00:21:59.60 --> 00:22:00.40
I'm like, oh, OK.

597
00:22:00.40 --> 00:22:02.20
I know any Portuguese, but I knew that.

598
00:22:02.20 --> 00:22:02.96
That's how I mean it.

599
00:22:02.96 --> 00:22:04.72
It's about to get heated.

600
00:22:04.72 --> 00:22:06.04
And so Scotty, like.

601
00:22:06.04 --> 00:22:08.68
Was people at every school you went to, everyone tried to murder you?

602
00:22:08.68 --> 00:22:09.48
Yeah.

603
00:22:09.48 --> 00:22:13.28
And so Scotty, Scotty took all the videos of everything.

604
00:22:13.28 --> 00:22:16.44
And then like that's when Glover was being built at that point.

605
00:22:16.44 --> 00:22:20.20
This is when Scotty's making videos like Ringworm and all their videos.

606
00:22:20.20 --> 00:22:20.92
All the stuff.

607
00:22:20.92 --> 00:22:22.12
He had dang fever.

608
00:22:22.12 --> 00:22:23.08
Oh, that's right.

609
00:22:23.08 --> 00:22:23.32
That's right.

610
00:22:23.32 --> 00:22:27.72
Scotty got to make the videos because of me, because Carlson's best friend was Pocketa.

611
00:22:27.72 --> 00:22:30.72
He was the guy that filmed like Carlson's best friend.

612
00:22:30.72 --> 00:22:31.80
He's like, hey, what should you do?

613
00:22:31.80 --> 00:22:32.56
You should film.

614
00:22:32.56 --> 00:22:34.80
So Pocketa filmed everything.

615
00:22:34.80 --> 00:22:36.68
So then they showed up to the house.

616
00:22:36.68 --> 00:22:39.12
They're like, we don't like your friend Scotty.

617
00:22:39.12 --> 00:22:40.56
He films everything he's making.

618
00:22:40.56 --> 00:22:43.000
I was you can't just show up to Brazil and film everyone.

619
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.20
And like we don't like him.

620
00:22:46.20 --> 00:22:47.48
They don't like when you do that here.

621
00:22:47.48 --> 00:22:47.72
Let alone.

622
00:22:47.72 --> 00:22:48.04
Yeah.

623
00:22:48.04 --> 00:22:50.36
So Scotty's blood hair blue.

624
00:22:50.36 --> 00:22:50.92
Especially back in the day, dude.

625
00:22:50.92 --> 00:22:54.72
Because back in the day, it wasn't like now, you know, you can go on BJJ Fanatics and just

626
00:22:54.72 --> 00:22:58.56
get like the best moves of anyone because they're, you know, you can go buy them.

627
00:22:58.56 --> 00:23:03.20
But back in the day, you couldn't buy the best moves from anyone because it was a secret

628
00:23:03.20 --> 00:23:04.48
inside that academy.

629
00:23:04.48 --> 00:23:06.64
No, because hectic because Scotty was from Health Gracie.

630
00:23:06.64 --> 00:23:08.48
Health made them nervous.

631
00:23:08.48 --> 00:23:11.60
Health still makes people a little nervous.

632
00:23:11.60 --> 00:23:12.72
But they didn't really care.

633
00:23:12.72 --> 00:23:15.04
They're like, you know, Scotty is Scotty.

634
00:23:15.04 --> 00:23:19.08
I got to go and I'm like, they're like, what do you think of him?

635
00:23:19.08 --> 00:23:20.36
In Brazil, they talk like that.

636
00:23:20.36 --> 00:23:21.24
They talk like family.

637
00:23:21.24 --> 00:23:22.88
What do you think of Scotty?

638
00:23:22.88 --> 00:23:24.72
I mean, Scotty's like my brother.

639
00:23:24.72 --> 00:23:26.000
And then look at Pocket towel.

640
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.08
What do you think of Scotty?

641
00:23:27.08 --> 00:23:28.76
He's like Scotty's like my son.

642
00:23:28.76 --> 00:23:34.28
Oh, so bam, Scotty got to film everything at that point in time.

643
00:23:34.28 --> 00:23:37.12
Dude, I remember those movies back in the day.

644
00:23:37.12 --> 00:23:38.12
So Scotty and everything.

645
00:23:38.12 --> 00:23:39.16
They were like gold.

646
00:23:39.16 --> 00:23:41.88
At that point in time, they're like, they're telling about this Glover guy.

647
00:23:41.88 --> 00:23:44.76
I'm hearing about these guys back in the United States.

648
00:23:44.76 --> 00:23:45.60
I didn't give a shit.

649
00:23:45.60 --> 00:23:47.08
I was like, no, I'm in Brazil.

650
00:23:47.08 --> 00:23:48.08
I'm here.

651
00:23:48.08 --> 00:23:49.80
I don't care about anyone over there.

652
00:23:49.80 --> 00:23:52.32
I'm like, I was there on one thing.

653
00:23:52.32 --> 00:23:57.20
It was just a smash and like and do whatever I needed to do.

654
00:23:57.20 --> 00:24:01.80
Just as the only one left on my team.

655
00:24:01.80 --> 00:24:08.36
And so Glover was able to like, Scotty had a big part in Glover.

656
00:24:08.36 --> 00:24:10.56
I'll guarantee you, like he not going to tell you that.

657
00:24:10.56 --> 00:24:13.28
Well, he will tell you that like Fran Junior for sure.

658
00:24:13.28 --> 00:24:17.64
But Scotty gave you access to things that like not just me, though, like that's his

659
00:24:17.64 --> 00:24:18.64
hand.

660
00:24:18.64 --> 00:24:21.04
So the Scotty that worked out for people that have no idea that we're talking about.

661
00:24:21.04 --> 00:24:22.04
He's a hospital.

662
00:24:22.04 --> 00:24:23.04
Yeah, Scotty.

663
00:24:23.04 --> 00:24:25.68
But back in the yeah, now he has a hospital.

664
00:24:25.68 --> 00:24:27.000
What's the name of the hospital in Mexico?

665
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.88
Chipsa Chipsa Chipsa.

666
00:24:28.88 --> 00:24:33.36
So he's doing a bunch of great work helping people with stem cells.

667
00:24:33.36 --> 00:24:37.08
If you're interested in that, you can fly into San Diego and go down across the border.

668
00:24:37.08 --> 00:24:39.08
This is way before this is dude.

669
00:24:39.08 --> 00:24:42.28
This is I mean, when I met those guys, yeah, when I met those guys, they were living in

670
00:24:42.28 --> 00:24:46.68
like a like a broken down loft up in San Francisco.

671
00:24:46.68 --> 00:24:50.48
Me and Dean List go up there for, you know, to go out, hang out, train and what not.

672
00:24:50.48 --> 00:24:52.48
Scotty was the coolest person at that point.

673
00:24:52.48 --> 00:24:58.92
And when you want to close people in America, as far as bringing people together and showing

674
00:24:58.92 --> 00:25:01.84
them a good time, like because not too many people were able to do that.

675
00:25:01.84 --> 00:25:03.88
How is he going to bring all these people right?

676
00:25:03.88 --> 00:25:06.92
Whatever we think from all shapes of life.

677
00:25:06.92 --> 00:25:07.92
You're crushing it Pete.

678
00:25:07.92 --> 00:25:08.92
Keep going.

679
00:25:08.92 --> 00:25:11.88
So what's the when did you meet Scotty then, Jeff?

680
00:25:11.88 --> 00:25:17.68
I mean, early he was already sponsoring Tyrone and Tyrone was like, you should look at my

681
00:25:17.68 --> 00:25:22.52
little white brother and Scotty was like, yeah, he's awesome.

682
00:25:22.52 --> 00:25:27.28
And then as a blue belt, I had an OTM patch on my G and you know, you.

683
00:25:27.28 --> 00:25:30.76
So you started competing as a white belt.

684
00:25:30.76 --> 00:25:34.76
You just started getting in there and you were you were so you must have been like 16,

685
00:25:34.76 --> 00:25:36.52
17 years old when you started competing.

686
00:25:36.52 --> 00:25:37.52
Yeah.

687
00:25:37.52 --> 00:25:40.44
I think the first one I did was 17.

688
00:25:40.44 --> 00:25:47.88
There's something about you though, like the whole time that you've been doing Jiu Jitsu,

689
00:25:47.88 --> 00:25:52.24
you've been doing things that other people weren't doing.

690
00:25:52.24 --> 00:25:55.88
You've been doing things that at least as far as I know, it's kind of it's similar to

691
00:25:55.88 --> 00:25:56.88
Dean Lister.

692
00:25:56.88 --> 00:26:02.84
Like my brother Dean, you know, he was doing things that literally people were not doing

693
00:26:02.84 --> 00:26:06.16
and you're the same way as a white belt.

694
00:26:06.16 --> 00:26:08.44
I don't I don't know that early on I was like that.

695
00:26:08.44 --> 00:26:12.40
I think I was doing good job.

696
00:26:12.40 --> 00:26:18.84
I think I was doing Jiu Jitsu right and just with really good motor skills and amazing

697
00:26:18.84 --> 00:26:25.24
balance and it was just normal Jiu Jitsu done in a way that looks different.

698
00:26:25.24 --> 00:26:27.36
You know, Dean was actually doing different things.

699
00:26:27.36 --> 00:26:29.36
Dean was doing things that were like illegal.

700
00:26:29.36 --> 00:26:31.56
You know what I'm saying?

701
00:26:31.56 --> 00:26:37.16
I was taking the back triangles doing bow and arrow jokes, you know, I was doing attacks

702
00:26:37.16 --> 00:26:38.16
on the guard.

703
00:26:38.16 --> 00:26:41.60
I guess I guess you're right because now that I think about a little bit more, you were

704
00:26:41.60 --> 00:26:46.40
doing normal stuff, but damn, you're doing it in an abnormal way because even today you

705
00:26:46.40 --> 00:26:49.000
can go watch your videos from when you were a white belt or a blue belt and you're like

706
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.60
that does not look like normal Jiu Jitsu, the fluidity of your movement.

707
00:26:53.60 --> 00:26:57.04
And you know, you were teaching class yesterday and you were going through this thing where

708
00:26:57.04 --> 00:27:00.40
you're like, Hey, just sit here and bounce back and forth and now and you're just talking

709
00:27:00.40 --> 00:27:01.88
about shadow wrestling.

710
00:27:01.88 --> 00:27:04.20
And so I'm sitting there like just doing what I'm told like, okay, we're bouncing back

711
00:27:04.20 --> 00:27:08.40
and forth and then you're saying like hit a single hit a double and then you're like,

712
00:27:08.40 --> 00:27:09.40
All right, stay in your square.

713
00:27:09.40 --> 00:27:10.40
But stay in your square.

714
00:27:10.40 --> 00:27:13.60
But now get get it down and half guard, get that deep heart.

715
00:27:13.60 --> 00:27:17.000
And you're doing this shadow like there's no other people and I'm watching you do it.

716
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.60
And I was like, Damn, I'm a loser.

717
00:27:19.60 --> 00:27:28.000
I am such a loser because I can see that you're getting better with no partner.

718
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.12
Just doing the moves, doing the movements.

719
00:27:30.12 --> 00:27:34.56
Your brain is just tapped into going through and making it happen.

720
00:27:34.56 --> 00:27:38.36
And I was like, God, I'm such a loser.

721
00:27:38.36 --> 00:27:40.68
And you're literally saying like, this is how you can get better.

722
00:27:40.68 --> 00:27:42.88
This is how you get, I'm thinking, God, I'm an idiot.

723
00:27:42.88 --> 00:27:46.64
How did I not be doing this for all these years?

724
00:27:46.64 --> 00:27:49.68
Going back to the story though, you started competing.

725
00:27:49.68 --> 00:27:51.60
You started kicking ass really early.

726
00:27:51.60 --> 00:27:55.000
I mean, you were freaking, you came onto the scene in a fury.

727
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Yeah.

728
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Yeah.

729
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.68
I mean, for my against my peers, I always did really well.

730
00:27:58.68 --> 00:27:59.96
Hey, how many hours a day?

731
00:27:59.96 --> 00:28:01.24
Which you're like, Oh, P train more.

732
00:28:01.24 --> 00:28:02.76
You must have been training.

733
00:28:02.76 --> 00:28:03.76
Freakin.

734
00:28:03.76 --> 00:28:07.92
I mean, training, like, I think when people say training, they mean like rolling.

735
00:28:07.92 --> 00:28:09.08
Oh, I mean, on the mats.

736
00:28:09.08 --> 00:28:12.08
I mean, I was assisting in every class.

737
00:28:12.08 --> 00:28:17.68
All of Frenzy is private classes, has women's self-defense classes, his little kids classes.

738
00:28:17.68 --> 00:28:20.000
How long a day, how many hours a day were you at the academy?

739
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.52
I mean, it was like, if I missed more than two classes, the whole like free Jiu-Jitsu

740
00:28:24.52 --> 00:28:25.76
thing was over.

741
00:28:25.76 --> 00:28:31.12
So you're, you're, you're doing five classes a day, four classes a day.

742
00:28:31.12 --> 00:28:32.12
Yeah.

743
00:28:32.12 --> 00:28:33.12
Every day.

744
00:28:33.12 --> 00:28:34.12
Yeah.

745
00:28:34.12 --> 00:28:35.12
But I didn't roll.

746
00:28:35.12 --> 00:28:36.88
No, you're not going to roll every single class, but that's the thing.

747
00:28:36.88 --> 00:28:39.80
And I noticed there's another thing about you.

748
00:28:39.80 --> 00:28:47.88
You have a way of rolling that is it's not rolling fully, but it's rolling.

749
00:28:47.88 --> 00:28:51.28
It's like a playful role where you're going through wild positions and crazy things are

750
00:28:51.28 --> 00:28:53.000
happening and that's another thing.

751
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.60
And you know, it's, I used to watch you do this when you taught here and I'd be like,

752
00:28:56.60 --> 00:28:57.60
oh yeah, that's awesome.

753
00:28:57.60 --> 00:28:58.60
Yeah.

754
00:28:58.60 --> 00:29:00.12
And I kind of thought of it as like a cool thing.

755
00:29:00.12 --> 00:29:02.72
And then I just realized when you were here and I was watching, actually I was watching

756
00:29:02.72 --> 00:29:07.08
you and Pete roll and I was like, oh, this is how this bastard's getting so good because

757
00:29:07.08 --> 00:29:11.40
he's trying all this wild stuff against a partner that he's kind of playing with that

758
00:29:11.40 --> 00:29:12.84
playing together.

759
00:29:12.84 --> 00:29:13.84
Yeah.

760
00:29:13.84 --> 00:29:14.84
And that's a different thing.

761
00:29:14.84 --> 00:29:16.88
And I remember that actually Dean and I used to do that.

762
00:29:16.88 --> 00:29:21.000
Dean and I would do that where we're sort of going.

763
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.32
But we're also kind of just playing, but if it's going to work, you can kind of tell

764
00:29:26.32 --> 00:29:27.32
it's going to work.

765
00:29:27.32 --> 00:29:28.64
And if it's not going to work, you can tell it's not going to work, but you don't get

766
00:29:28.64 --> 00:29:33.40
all locked up in one position and sit there across the side for 48 minutes, which there's

767
00:29:33.40 --> 00:29:34.40
not much progress.

768
00:29:34.40 --> 00:29:35.76
You have to play before you can fight.

769
00:29:35.76 --> 00:29:37.08
It's like in boxing.

770
00:29:37.08 --> 00:29:41.92
A boxing coach won't hold paths for you unless you're good at shadow boxing and bag work

771
00:29:41.92 --> 00:29:44.32
first because you're going to fucking hit them.

772
00:29:44.32 --> 00:29:45.76
You know, you're going to hurt them.

773
00:29:45.76 --> 00:29:49.80
As a Jiu-Jitsu coach, I don't want to work with a Jiu-Jitsu student that doesn't have

774
00:29:49.80 --> 00:29:51.40
a good stance.

775
00:29:51.40 --> 00:29:52.40
I'm like, let me see your stance.

776
00:29:52.40 --> 00:29:54.60
And they're like, I don't know what to do with my hands.

777
00:29:54.60 --> 00:29:57.88
I'm like, whoa, you're not, I'm not rolling with that dude.

778
00:29:57.88 --> 00:29:58.88
He's going to hurt me.

779
00:29:58.88 --> 00:30:02.68
And if I roll with him, I'm going to only, only win.

780
00:30:02.68 --> 00:30:05.48
There's no like letting this dude get anything because he's going to do it wrong and hurt

781
00:30:05.48 --> 00:30:06.48
me.

782
00:30:06.48 --> 00:30:07.48
You know what I'm saying?

783
00:30:07.48 --> 00:30:10.20
And then I start feeling bad because I'm just breaking some dude off like as hard as

784
00:30:10.20 --> 00:30:11.20
I can.

785
00:30:11.20 --> 00:30:13.40
And he's all brand new and he doesn't understand.

786
00:30:13.40 --> 00:30:14.80
I'm just trying not to get hurt.

787
00:30:14.80 --> 00:30:15.80
Yeah.

788
00:30:15.80 --> 00:30:18.08
Well, that was another interesting thing you told me one time.

789
00:30:18.08 --> 00:30:23.60
You said, Hey, for me, the easiest people for me, Jeff Glover to go against is like

790
00:30:23.60 --> 00:30:25.80
big muscle guys.

791
00:30:25.80 --> 00:30:30.56
And I witnessed that countless times where like some big jack guy would come in here

792
00:30:30.56 --> 00:30:35.12
and you could see, you know, whatever he's thinking he's hanging onto is not there anymore

793
00:30:35.12 --> 00:30:37.80
like a half a second later, it's gone.

794
00:30:37.80 --> 00:30:41.72
You're all of a sudden slipping over there, slipping over there.

795
00:30:41.72 --> 00:30:43.60
How about your flexibility, bro?

796
00:30:43.60 --> 00:30:45.12
You got some wild flexibility.

797
00:30:45.12 --> 00:30:47.60
How much of that is natural and how much of it is work?

798
00:30:47.60 --> 00:30:50.16
I mean, it's all natural.

799
00:30:50.16 --> 00:30:52.32
I don't stretch.

800
00:30:52.32 --> 00:30:53.32
Never stretched.

801
00:30:53.32 --> 00:30:54.32
No.

802
00:30:54.32 --> 00:30:55.32
God.

803
00:30:55.32 --> 00:30:56.32
That's crazy.

804
00:30:56.32 --> 00:30:58.68
You ever see me stretch Pete?

805
00:30:58.68 --> 00:31:03.64
He just like does like freak show stretches just to show people like how twists his ankles

806
00:31:03.64 --> 00:31:04.64
around.

807
00:31:04.64 --> 00:31:09.32
But as far as like going out there and doing a yoga, we went to like meet some chicks one

808
00:31:09.32 --> 00:31:10.32
time.

809
00:31:10.32 --> 00:31:13.64
How do I was it?

810
00:31:13.64 --> 00:31:15.88
No, I mean, he was more flexible than everyone.

811
00:31:15.88 --> 00:31:18.24
Like we're not falling for that again.

812
00:31:18.24 --> 00:31:19.24
No.

813
00:31:19.24 --> 00:31:23.56
So, you know, Glover is one of those people, you know, if you tell someone, you know, not

814
00:31:23.56 --> 00:31:28.20
to use your strength, but then I tell them not to use your flexibility.

815
00:31:28.20 --> 00:31:31.96
So then, you know, we all have talents that we should.

816
00:31:31.96 --> 00:31:39.72
But yeah, the way Glover and I play is, we warm each other up in case we really have to

817
00:31:39.72 --> 00:31:42.96
do something is for most people.

818
00:31:42.96 --> 00:31:47.32
See, we're expecting to be rolling and then some dude wants to challenge us.

819
00:31:47.32 --> 00:31:52.12
So we're warming ourselves up at all times as opposed to hurting each other.

820
00:31:52.12 --> 00:31:54.44
And then someone walks in the room and then what?

821
00:31:54.44 --> 00:31:55.44
Yeah.

822
00:31:55.44 --> 00:31:56.44
Then we're already hurt.

823
00:31:56.44 --> 00:31:59.72
Like the way we play, he's getting sharper.

824
00:31:59.72 --> 00:32:01.36
I'm getting sharper.

825
00:32:01.36 --> 00:32:05.24
And then if we really got to do it, then we do it.

826
00:32:05.24 --> 00:32:07.72
We're sharpening these things pretty much.

827
00:32:07.72 --> 00:32:11.52
We're not, we're not putting in battle because we already know what it could do.

828
00:32:11.52 --> 00:32:14.40
But we'll keep it sharp.

829
00:32:14.40 --> 00:32:15.40
This thing is pretty sharp.

830
00:32:15.40 --> 00:32:17.76
No, that one's not sharp at all.

831
00:32:17.76 --> 00:32:18.76
Yeah.

832
00:32:18.76 --> 00:32:25.40
So, so Jeff, you're saying, you know, white belt, blue belt, you're kind of doing normal

833
00:32:25.40 --> 00:32:26.40
jiu-jitsu moves.

834
00:32:26.40 --> 00:32:27.68
You're just doing them super fluid.

835
00:32:27.68 --> 00:32:30.96
And again, anybody go watch YouTube or whatever and check out some of this stuff.

836
00:32:30.96 --> 00:32:36.64
Well, what's the first thing you remember kind of, kind of thinking, Hey, I'm making

837
00:32:36.64 --> 00:32:37.64
this up.

838
00:32:37.64 --> 00:32:38.64
This is new.

839
00:32:38.64 --> 00:32:42.32
I'm creating this thing right now.

840
00:32:42.32 --> 00:32:44.44
I don't know that I did it intentionally.

841
00:32:44.44 --> 00:32:48.76
It would be somebody else pointing it out to me and be like, Hey, did you notice you

842
00:32:48.76 --> 00:32:49.76
did this when you rolled?

843
00:32:49.76 --> 00:32:52.56
And I'd be like, No, I have no idea what just happened.

844
00:32:52.56 --> 00:32:56.36
I was just, you know, responding to all the training that Fringio put me through.

845
00:32:56.36 --> 00:32:59.36
And it would just work, you know,

846
00:32:59.36 --> 00:33:01.84
You're a deep half guard.

847
00:33:01.84 --> 00:33:06.04
Is that, I mean, you're definitely known for the deep half guard, especially back in

848
00:33:06.04 --> 00:33:08.48
the day.

849
00:33:08.48 --> 00:33:11.68
Was that something that you were like, all of a sudden you realized you had this position?

850
00:33:11.68 --> 00:33:16.32
I remember you teaching me deep half guard.

851
00:33:16.32 --> 00:33:20.16
And the coolest thing was that you do deep half guard to me and you just like sort of

852
00:33:20.16 --> 00:33:23.000
pose the question like, What, what are you going to do?

853
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.96
Jocko, because you're 225 pounds and where are you going to go?

854
00:33:27.96 --> 00:33:31.16
And you have, you have control of my leg.

855
00:33:31.16 --> 00:33:36.24
It's like your whole body is on my leg, but then I can't do anything.

856
00:33:36.24 --> 00:33:37.48
Was the deep half guard.

857
00:33:37.48 --> 00:33:42.08
Is that, was that the first thing that you started getting recognized for?

858
00:33:42.08 --> 00:33:43.60
As like your own thing?

859
00:33:43.60 --> 00:33:45.76
It was our team's thing.

860
00:33:45.76 --> 00:33:48.16
Frangio used it just as much as I did.

861
00:33:48.16 --> 00:33:49.16
So did Bill.

862
00:33:49.16 --> 00:33:50.84
So did Tyrone.

863
00:33:50.84 --> 00:33:56.12
Anybody who was winning tournaments from Paragon team was using that fucking suite.

864
00:33:56.12 --> 00:34:06.000
But I think, I think what I did was I recognized that all the sweeps are not just randomly used.

865
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.92
It works best when you have an initial off balancing movement.

866
00:34:10.92 --> 00:34:14.64
And I realized at that point that I was doing that I was going into deep half guard and

867
00:34:14.64 --> 00:34:17.08
just trying random moves and hoping they would work.

868
00:34:17.08 --> 00:34:18.08
And often they would.

869
00:34:18.08 --> 00:34:19.28
They would oftentimes work.

870
00:34:19.28 --> 00:34:22.48
I would be like, let me try this random move and boom, the guy would get swept.

871
00:34:22.48 --> 00:34:23.48
Like, Oh, cool.

872
00:34:23.48 --> 00:34:25.80
And then would you load that into your repertoire?

873
00:34:25.80 --> 00:34:26.80
Yeah.

874
00:34:26.80 --> 00:34:28.28
I was like, Okay, now I got another suite.

875
00:34:28.28 --> 00:34:32.84
Well, I, I do it's, I had the light bulb when I realized it was only three sweeps.

876
00:34:32.84 --> 00:34:37.20
I thought that it was like 15, 20 different things I had to learn when I found out that,

877
00:34:37.20 --> 00:34:40.04
Oh my God, I keep repeating these three things over and over again.

878
00:34:40.04 --> 00:34:42.20
And it took me so long.

879
00:34:42.20 --> 00:34:43.60
I used to do like three months.

880
00:34:43.60 --> 00:34:46.12
So it would focus on three months on one move.

881
00:34:46.12 --> 00:34:49.64
Every time I rolled with somebody, I was only doing on a plot for three months.

882
00:34:49.64 --> 00:34:54.000
And at the end of three months, I was, I was fricking, I hated that move.

883
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
I felt like a cheater.

884
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.56
If I was, I was so good at it that it's, it wasn't fun anymore.

885
00:34:58.56 --> 00:34:59.56
You know what I'm saying?

886
00:34:59.56 --> 00:35:02.36
When you got a move that just works for you so well, you feel like you're cheating, you

887
00:35:02.36 --> 00:35:03.36
know, doing it to wipe out.

888
00:35:03.36 --> 00:35:06.32
So you're like, how good do I really feel about that?

889
00:35:06.32 --> 00:35:07.32
You know what I'm saying?

890
00:35:07.32 --> 00:35:08.32
I'm sitting the bar higher for myself.

891
00:35:08.32 --> 00:35:10.36
So it didn't get like that with deep half guard.

892
00:35:10.36 --> 00:35:11.96
It got to like year three and four.

893
00:35:11.96 --> 00:35:15.92
And I was still like excited to use it every time I rolled.

894
00:35:15.92 --> 00:35:17.52
And it was making life so easy.

895
00:35:17.52 --> 00:35:22.36
And you started seeing the clarity and the simplicity actually get narrowed down over

896
00:35:22.36 --> 00:35:26.92
time because you thought the half guard was so many different moves, but really you can

897
00:35:26.92 --> 00:35:28.40
sweep them to the left.

898
00:35:28.40 --> 00:35:30.64
You can sweep them to the right or you can come out the back.

899
00:35:30.64 --> 00:35:31.64
That's kind of what it is.

900
00:35:31.64 --> 00:35:35.36
Basically, yeah, it's always going to be a variation of one of three moves.

901
00:35:35.36 --> 00:35:37.72
And they all set each other up.

902
00:35:37.72 --> 00:35:38.72
They're all, yeah.

903
00:35:38.72 --> 00:35:41.60
There's a whole, there's a whole thing that's really easy to learn.

904
00:35:41.60 --> 00:35:45.64
You know, if I can grab your leg, I can show it to you and explain it to you in like five

905
00:35:45.64 --> 00:35:46.64
minutes.

906
00:35:46.64 --> 00:35:50.000
And most guard systems do not take five minutes to explain.

907
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.48
Most guard systems, you need like two hours.

908
00:35:52.48 --> 00:35:56.12
And I can honestly give you the gist of this system in like under 10.

909
00:35:56.12 --> 00:35:57.12
No, it's.

910
00:35:57.12 --> 00:35:59.52
Pete explains it better than I do, to be honest with you.

911
00:35:59.52 --> 00:36:02.72
And it's one of those things that when I, when you, when you were teaching here and

912
00:36:02.72 --> 00:36:07.44
I was like, this stuff is, it's crazy how it is pretty simple.

913
00:36:07.44 --> 00:36:10.32
I mean, when you, you were already to the point when you came here, I mean, you were

914
00:36:10.32 --> 00:36:11.72
a freaking champion and everything else.

915
00:36:11.72 --> 00:36:17.08
So you were not only highly proficient at the move, you're also highly proficient at teaching

916
00:36:17.08 --> 00:36:19.72
it and all the little drills.

917
00:36:19.72 --> 00:36:26.48
Another thing that Jeff Glover has drills, little physical drills that make you better

918
00:36:26.48 --> 00:36:31.04
at the movement that make you better at jujitsu.

919
00:36:31.04 --> 00:36:32.04
Motor skills.

920
00:36:32.04 --> 00:36:33.04
Somebody said that to me the other day.

921
00:36:33.04 --> 00:36:35.04
They're like, Glover, you got motor skills.

922
00:36:35.04 --> 00:36:41.88
And I was like, yeah, I said that to you the other day when you were teaching.

923
00:36:41.88 --> 00:36:47.32
No, what I said was, I feel like if Jeff Glover's watching me try to do one of his moves, he

924
00:36:47.32 --> 00:36:49.12
just thinks this guy's an idiot.

925
00:36:49.12 --> 00:36:54.32
Like this guy doesn't, doesn't have any motor skills.

926
00:36:54.32 --> 00:36:56.76
So you're in this competition mode.

927
00:36:56.76 --> 00:37:00.08
So now we're talking like, what is it now?

928
00:37:00.08 --> 00:37:07.28
The year 2000, 2001, now you're competing all the time, 2002, 2003, you're mopping up competitions.

929
00:37:07.28 --> 00:37:14.64
The other thing that's rad about Jeff Glover is what's Jeff Glover's weight class?

930
00:37:14.64 --> 00:37:15.64
Whatever.

931
00:37:15.64 --> 00:37:19.44
Dude, all those old like grappling quest videos where you're going in against guys that are

932
00:37:19.44 --> 00:37:23.40
300 pounds, literally 300 pounds, 240 pounds.

933
00:37:23.40 --> 00:37:25.32
Back to big giant dudes.

934
00:37:25.32 --> 00:37:26.32
What was the story behind that?

935
00:37:26.32 --> 00:37:28.60
You just didn't give a shit.

936
00:37:28.60 --> 00:37:29.60
Deep half garden.

937
00:37:29.60 --> 00:37:30.60
Deep half garden.

938
00:37:30.60 --> 00:37:32.20
The bigger they get, the more I use the deep half garden.

939
00:37:32.20 --> 00:37:33.20
Yeah.

940
00:37:33.20 --> 00:37:34.20
Come out the back door.

941
00:37:34.20 --> 00:37:35.20
Yeah.

942
00:37:35.20 --> 00:37:36.20
No problem.

943
00:37:36.20 --> 00:37:37.20
Up on a single.

944
00:37:37.20 --> 00:37:38.20
Or up on any of them.

945
00:37:38.20 --> 00:37:39.20
They all work really well.

946
00:37:39.20 --> 00:37:42.60
See, if not, when you're caught in that quarter guard position, when someone's trying to mount

947
00:37:42.60 --> 00:37:50.80
you, you, if you look at the last ADCC with the super fight of Gordon versus Galvan, Gordon

948
00:37:50.80 --> 00:37:53.80
had him trapped in the quarter guard.

949
00:37:53.80 --> 00:37:56.24
So, Galvan had two options or three.

950
00:37:56.24 --> 00:38:03.000
He could either accept the mount, turn stomach down, give the choke, or he could have went

951
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.28
and did Jeff Glover right there and dive under the leg and went deep half garden.

952
00:38:07.28 --> 00:38:10.12
That's something you got to be kind of crazy to do.

953
00:38:10.12 --> 00:38:11.12
It's the deep half.

954
00:38:11.12 --> 00:38:14.20
The way I teach the deep half garden, you'll never get mounted again.

955
00:38:14.20 --> 00:38:16.08
You don't get mounted and you don't get your back taken.

956
00:38:16.08 --> 00:38:17.92
It's the anti-mount pretty much.

957
00:38:17.92 --> 00:38:18.92
It's anti this.

958
00:38:18.92 --> 00:38:21.60
It's how Jiu-Jitsu used to be when we all first started.

959
00:38:21.60 --> 00:38:24.52
It used to be you go from close guard to mount.

960
00:38:24.52 --> 00:38:27.84
There's none of this knee slide to side control shit first.

961
00:38:27.84 --> 00:38:29.96
It was go from close guard to mount.

962
00:38:29.96 --> 00:38:31.88
When dudes are good at that, it fucking sucks.

963
00:38:31.88 --> 00:38:33.48
That's what Roger Gracie does.

964
00:38:33.48 --> 00:38:35.56
And that's what Gordon's so good at that now.

965
00:38:35.56 --> 00:38:37.88
He's so good at just going straight to mount, dude.

966
00:38:37.88 --> 00:38:38.88
You know what I'm saying?

967
00:38:38.88 --> 00:38:41.16
And that's what I used to have to defend with Franjia all the time.

968
00:38:41.16 --> 00:38:44.96
And Franjia gave up on trying to tell students to do that shit.

969
00:38:44.96 --> 00:38:48.16
Because everybody on the grappling scene, they were all like, oh, knee slide to side mount.

970
00:38:48.16 --> 00:38:49.16
And he was like, that's whack.

971
00:38:49.16 --> 00:38:50.16
Go to mount.

972
00:38:50.16 --> 00:38:51.16
And people were like, that's harder.

973
00:38:51.16 --> 00:38:53.56
And he's like, at first it's harder.

974
00:38:53.56 --> 00:38:57.60
But the end results dog, you get a mount where the submission is just right there now.

975
00:38:57.60 --> 00:38:59.40
It's like a checkmate type mount.

976
00:38:59.40 --> 00:39:00.40
And he was like, whatever.

977
00:39:00.40 --> 00:39:01.40
Nobody wants to listen to me.

978
00:39:01.40 --> 00:39:02.40
And we were at the whole community.

979
00:39:02.40 --> 00:39:03.88
We were all like knee slides, knee slides.

980
00:39:03.88 --> 00:39:05.88
And now Gordon's showing you guys knee slides.

981
00:39:05.88 --> 00:39:06.88
Mount.

982
00:39:06.88 --> 00:39:07.88
Right?

983
00:39:07.88 --> 00:39:11.40
So this deep half guard is designed to deal with that shit.

984
00:39:11.40 --> 00:39:12.76
To get under that mount.

985
00:39:12.76 --> 00:39:15.08
To deal with that shit right there.

986
00:39:15.08 --> 00:39:19.60
That's how Glover's able to beat these big guys because he can either stay there and

987
00:39:19.60 --> 00:39:25.72
get trapped and mounted or he can dive under and diving under scary because they're right

988
00:39:25.72 --> 00:39:27.12
above you.

989
00:39:27.12 --> 00:39:31.56
And if you don't know what you're doing right there, most people try it and then they kind

990
00:39:31.56 --> 00:39:33.72
of get a, was it claustrophobic, right?

991
00:39:33.72 --> 00:39:34.72
Yeah.

992
00:39:34.72 --> 00:39:35.96
They get claustrophobic and bail on it.

993
00:39:35.96 --> 00:39:36.96
They panic and they bail on it.

994
00:39:36.96 --> 00:39:38.60
They panic and they're like, it doesn't work.

995
00:39:38.60 --> 00:39:39.60
It doesn't work.

996
00:39:39.60 --> 00:39:40.60
Yeah.

997
00:39:40.60 --> 00:39:42.96
Well, that's another thing you and I were talking about the other day, Jeff, is when you first

998
00:39:42.96 --> 00:39:46.44
try a move in Jiu Jitsu, it's not going to work.

999
00:39:46.44 --> 00:39:51.40
I mean, it may work like 10% of the time, but it's the same thing with anything in life.

1000
00:39:51.40 --> 00:39:56.68
When you incorporate something new into your life, if you're working at a, at a business

1001
00:39:56.68 --> 00:40:01.24
and you incorporate some new process at first, it's going to be less efficient.

1002
00:40:01.24 --> 00:40:02.24
That's the way it works.

1003
00:40:02.24 --> 00:40:05.96
So you're going to, no one knows exactly how to do the process or everyone's kind of messing

1004
00:40:05.96 --> 00:40:08.20
it up and they're taking a little longer.

1005
00:40:08.20 --> 00:40:10.64
And so you're going to get less efficient when you first start trying a new process

1006
00:40:10.64 --> 00:40:11.64
in a business.

1007
00:40:11.64 --> 00:40:12.84
Same thing in Jiu Jitsu.

1008
00:40:12.84 --> 00:40:16.28
You bring some new moving to Jiu Jitsu.

1009
00:40:16.28 --> 00:40:19.48
It's going to make you worse for a while.

1010
00:40:19.48 --> 00:40:24.44
And I said for a while, you were like three months because you were teaching a whole

1011
00:40:24.44 --> 00:40:27.28
another series the other day.

1012
00:40:27.28 --> 00:40:31.80
And I said to you, I'm like, bro, I'm going to get my back taken a lot when I start doing

1013
00:40:31.80 --> 00:40:32.80
this.

1014
00:40:32.80 --> 00:40:33.80
And you go, yeah, you are.

1015
00:40:33.80 --> 00:40:34.80
And I was like, yeah, cool.

1016
00:40:34.80 --> 00:40:35.80
That's the way it is.

1017
00:40:35.80 --> 00:40:36.80
And I got done.

1018
00:40:36.80 --> 00:40:38.40
I was rolling and I was like, I got my back to back taken.

1019
00:40:38.40 --> 00:40:42.32
And you were like, yeah, you're going to keep getting your back taken for a while.

1020
00:40:42.32 --> 00:40:46.92
And I remember there was a position I used to teach and and I would teach it to people.

1021
00:40:46.92 --> 00:40:50.40
For me, it was like my main go to position of how to pass guard.

1022
00:40:50.40 --> 00:40:52.76
And it was like kind of unstoppable.

1023
00:40:52.76 --> 00:40:55.72
And I would teach it to people and then I'd see them try and do it.

1024
00:40:55.72 --> 00:41:00.16
They'd be all awkward and all off balance and stuff.

1025
00:41:00.16 --> 00:41:03.64
And I would say to them, they'd be like, I feel like I'm going to get swept and they

1026
00:41:03.64 --> 00:41:04.92
would get swept.

1027
00:41:04.92 --> 00:41:07.96
And I'd say, hey, man, you got to get comfortable in this position first.

1028
00:41:07.96 --> 00:41:11.56
Like it's going to take you a while to get to where you can just be here and just be like,

1029
00:41:11.56 --> 00:41:12.56
you know, nothing's going to happen.

1030
00:41:12.56 --> 00:41:13.56
You can't try and go me.

1031
00:41:13.56 --> 00:41:14.56
You can't arm lock me.

1032
00:41:14.56 --> 00:41:15.56
You can't sweep me.

1033
00:41:15.56 --> 00:41:16.88
I'm totally comfortable here and I'm going to pass your guard.

1034
00:41:16.88 --> 00:41:20.24
But it but it takes a while to get used to that stuff.

1035
00:41:20.24 --> 00:41:22.92
In order to do that, you got to put your ego in check.

1036
00:41:22.92 --> 00:41:27.60
I remember watching you, Jeff, for all you like, people are just getting, you're just

1037
00:41:27.60 --> 00:41:30.24
giving up a rear naked choke.

1038
00:41:30.24 --> 00:41:35.12
80% of the time you get out 20% of the time you tap and you're like, cool, let's roll

1039
00:41:35.12 --> 00:41:36.12
again.

1040
00:41:36.12 --> 00:41:37.12
Yeah.

1041
00:41:37.12 --> 00:41:46.24
Yeah, well, I was getting paid in those classes, you know, but that if you're not doing that,

1042
00:41:46.24 --> 00:41:47.96
you're not going to improve.

1043
00:41:47.96 --> 00:41:48.96
Yeah.

1044
00:41:48.96 --> 00:41:56.40
I don't, you know, I like, I like making the students truly believe they got coach.

1045
00:41:56.40 --> 00:41:58.84
You know, like, like, like they go home.

1046
00:41:58.84 --> 00:42:04.12
They're like, did I tap coach today?

1047
00:42:04.12 --> 00:42:09.92
You know, he legit like tapped hard and everything and he was struggling, grunting.

1048
00:42:09.92 --> 00:42:12.36
And I don't take time to explain to them whatever they want to ask.

1049
00:42:12.36 --> 00:42:13.36
Did I really get you?

1050
00:42:13.36 --> 00:42:14.92
I'll be like, you know, explain it to them.

1051
00:42:14.92 --> 00:42:16.48
But if they don't ask, I let them go home.

1052
00:42:16.48 --> 00:42:20.40
I'm not going to be like, I let you by the way, I let you get that by the way, just so

1053
00:42:20.40 --> 00:42:21.40
you know.

1054
00:42:21.40 --> 00:42:23.12
Like, I'm like, done.

1055
00:42:23.12 --> 00:42:24.12
Good job today, dude.

1056
00:42:24.12 --> 00:42:28.80
You got to match their energy almost match their heartbeat.

1057
00:42:28.80 --> 00:42:32.76
If they start going harder, we start going harder.

1058
00:42:32.76 --> 00:42:34.20
All right.

1059
00:42:34.20 --> 00:42:40.28
So when did you, what was like the highlight of your competition career, Pete?

1060
00:42:40.28 --> 00:42:42.80
Well, then, well, okay.

1061
00:42:42.80 --> 00:42:49.16
So let's see, besides Rafael Lovato and myself, there wasn't too many Americans pretty much

1062
00:42:49.16 --> 00:42:50.68
going to Brazil.

1063
00:42:50.68 --> 00:42:52.64
Rafael would come out and visit all the time.

1064
00:42:52.64 --> 00:42:54.12
His dad was cool.

1065
00:42:54.12 --> 00:43:00.20
He wouldn't live in Brazil, but he'd come out and so he, him and I were able to do well

1066
00:43:00.20 --> 00:43:02.000
out there.

1067
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.96
And so they put us in the great kid, we would usually get ripped off in tournaments.

1068
00:43:06.96 --> 00:43:12.12
Like we would, I would compete more than him, but the Brazilians liked us because we would

1069
00:43:12.12 --> 00:43:13.12
get ripped off.

1070
00:43:13.12 --> 00:43:14.72
There was no internet so much.

1071
00:43:14.72 --> 00:43:20.84
And, you know, like the last time I competed in Brazil's against Brawlio Stima and it was

1072
00:43:20.84 --> 00:43:22.36
like my fifth match of the world.

1073
00:43:22.36 --> 00:43:25.48
And I should have won, but then they gave him a time out.

1074
00:43:25.48 --> 00:43:26.84
They called the referee.

1075
00:43:26.84 --> 00:43:30.64
He brought over an oxygen tank right after I deep half guard swept them.

1076
00:43:30.64 --> 00:43:33.20
I dumped them, then they called a time out.

1077
00:43:33.20 --> 00:43:34.52
They brought him all the action.

1078
00:43:34.52 --> 00:43:35.80
They put him in his best move.

1079
00:43:35.80 --> 00:43:38.000
I didn't even know what was going on.

1080
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.88
I was like, Carlson came out.

1081
00:43:41.88 --> 00:43:43.000
He made it switch to ref.

1082
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
He threw out one of his cousins, the referee.

1083
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.32
And then it was, it was, you just realized like in these type of games, you could get

1084
00:43:53.32 --> 00:43:54.32
cheated.

1085
00:43:54.32 --> 00:43:57.40
They fed him some assaí.

1086
00:43:57.40 --> 00:44:02.96
In the tournament, basically we didn't, in those tournaments back in the day, you just

1087
00:44:02.96 --> 00:44:08.000
stuffed someone in a position you were good at and the time would run out and you'd win.

1088
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.84
That's how I wouldn't have the flash.

1089
00:44:09.84 --> 00:44:13.44
He wins because I would beat people that I wasn't supposed to beat.

1090
00:44:13.44 --> 00:44:18.000
I would go to Brazil and beat all those guys and they would never expect that.

1091
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.48
And I don't even remember most of their names, but there was a lot of good ones and all the

1092
00:44:21.48 --> 00:44:23.60
Brazilians knew me.

1093
00:44:23.60 --> 00:44:29.12
And then when I came back to Chicago, Carlson had moved to Chicago, but the level was low

1094
00:44:29.12 --> 00:44:30.88
because in Chicago.

1095
00:44:30.88 --> 00:44:31.88
Yeah.

1096
00:44:31.88 --> 00:44:34.20
It was just like regular people training.

1097
00:44:34.20 --> 00:44:36.24
And so I, BJ Penn had called me.

1098
00:44:36.24 --> 00:44:39.48
He's one of the friends at Scotty and I went over there and I was, I was living with BJ

1099
00:44:39.48 --> 00:44:42.28
Penn and that, that was a good highlight in Hawaii.

1100
00:44:42.28 --> 00:44:43.28
In Hawaii.

1101
00:44:43.28 --> 00:44:44.28
In Hawaii.

1102
00:44:44.28 --> 00:44:45.28
And he looked, oh, okay.

1103
00:44:45.28 --> 00:44:46.28
So I lived over there for a while.

1104
00:44:46.28 --> 00:44:50.56
So I'm actually Pete, the Greek, Brazilian, Sicilian, Peruvian, Hawaiian.

1105
00:44:50.56 --> 00:44:52.32
There's a whole bunch of them.

1106
00:44:52.32 --> 00:44:54.36
So I lived over there in Hawaii in Hilo.

1107
00:44:54.36 --> 00:44:58.96
And Jack Daniel, Jack Daniel Hill.

1108
00:44:58.96 --> 00:45:04.48
He was another guy that lived over there and trained like six hours a day.

1109
00:45:04.48 --> 00:45:05.48
Yeah.

1110
00:45:05.48 --> 00:45:07.84
It was just me and BJ Penn all day, all day.

1111
00:45:07.84 --> 00:45:13.44
So he'd pick me up and, you know, Hilo is one of those towns where it's adrenaline rush

1112
00:45:13.44 --> 00:45:14.44
all the time.

1113
00:45:14.44 --> 00:45:15.44
It's raining and stuff.

1114
00:45:15.44 --> 00:45:20.000
And we're just having fun cruising and have like Randy Couture come in and teach us how

1115
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
to wrestle.

1116
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.88
And he fought Leota Machida at that time.

1117
00:45:23.88 --> 00:45:26.12
So how long are you, how long are you living in Hawaii for?

1118
00:45:26.12 --> 00:45:27.96
For a while.

1119
00:45:27.96 --> 00:45:31.40
Can you put that in some kind of a time perspective?

1120
00:45:31.40 --> 00:45:32.40
I'm still there.

1121
00:45:32.40 --> 00:45:37.52
Like if you go there, they remember me like, look, I'll just be honest with you.

1122
00:45:37.52 --> 00:45:39.92
I went back to Brazil first time in 16 years.

1123
00:45:39.92 --> 00:45:42.36
It was in the middle of COVID.

1124
00:45:42.36 --> 00:45:43.36
Everything was shut down.

1125
00:45:43.36 --> 00:45:45.000
I'm talking about everything.

1126
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000
No one on the street.

1127
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.04
I brought gorilla hands out there.

1128
00:45:48.04 --> 00:45:49.72
He's from Brazil, but he never been to Rio.

1129
00:45:49.72 --> 00:45:53.96
And he went with me and they just let me and Hanzo out on the street and we actually bumped

1130
00:45:53.96 --> 00:45:54.96
into each other.

1131
00:45:54.96 --> 00:45:56.60
Just me, Hanzo and gorilla hands.

1132
00:45:56.60 --> 00:46:00.64
I have pictures and all of Rio, only people out in the street.

1133
00:46:00.64 --> 00:46:02.24
And they thought I still lived there.

1134
00:46:02.24 --> 00:46:03.84
They think I'm related to Hanzo.

1135
00:46:03.84 --> 00:46:05.72
Like they think I'm one of them.

1136
00:46:05.72 --> 00:46:06.96
That's how it is when I visit here.

1137
00:46:06.96 --> 00:46:07.96
But you look like Hanzo.

1138
00:46:07.96 --> 00:46:08.96
Yeah, or they look like me.

1139
00:46:08.96 --> 00:46:09.96
I don't know.

1140
00:46:09.96 --> 00:46:10.96
We all look like each other.

1141
00:46:10.96 --> 00:46:11.96
Do you still live here?

1142
00:46:11.96 --> 00:46:12.96
You move back.

1143
00:46:12.96 --> 00:46:14.60
So they have no idea I ever left.

1144
00:46:14.60 --> 00:46:16.60
You know, wherever I go, they still think I live there.

1145
00:46:16.60 --> 00:46:19.04
If you go to Hilo, you know, Pete.

1146
00:46:19.04 --> 00:46:23.92
Even here, I'm kind of still, Jeff and I are still here, even though we're not here.

1147
00:46:23.92 --> 00:46:26.72
And so we leave that type of presence because we loved jujitsu.

1148
00:46:26.72 --> 00:46:27.72
Okay.

1149
00:46:27.72 --> 00:46:33.60
So for some unquantifiable amount of time, you're living in Hawaii, you're training

1150
00:46:33.60 --> 00:46:35.52
with, with BJ Penn.

1151
00:46:35.52 --> 00:46:37.56
And this is when BJ Penn is like fighting.

1152
00:46:37.56 --> 00:46:38.56
Yeah.

1153
00:46:38.56 --> 00:46:42.12
Just one, he just beaten Matt Hughes, licked the blood off his face.

1154
00:46:42.12 --> 00:46:44.04
Which also, let me just throw this out there too.

1155
00:46:44.04 --> 00:46:48.72
You were talking about how sometimes the tournaments in Brazil could be very tough for an American

1156
00:46:48.72 --> 00:46:49.72
to win.

1157
00:46:49.72 --> 00:46:50.72
BJ Penn went down there and won.

1158
00:46:50.72 --> 00:46:51.92
But he's not even on the video.

1159
00:46:51.92 --> 00:46:55.44
So if you get the video from that year, that match isn't even on the video.

1160
00:46:55.44 --> 00:46:56.44
You know what I mean?

1161
00:46:56.44 --> 00:47:01.52
So it's like, they kind of like put that, and Hughes to train at Gracie Baja.

1162
00:47:01.52 --> 00:47:04.16
He's from health Gracie, but the same thing happened.

1163
00:47:04.16 --> 00:47:06.60
He got there as a hundred black belts on the mat.

1164
00:47:06.60 --> 00:47:08.08
The first day everyone trained with him.

1165
00:47:08.08 --> 00:47:10.68
The second day no one wanted to even touch him.

1166
00:47:10.68 --> 00:47:16.16
And so then he went over to another team, Carlson Gracie Blackwell, Novo Nyal.

1167
00:47:16.16 --> 00:47:17.16
Pedoneras.

1168
00:47:17.16 --> 00:47:18.16
He goes over there as a purple belt.

1169
00:47:18.16 --> 00:47:21.84
And then he tells me, Pete, I walked up in there, I was nervous.

1170
00:47:21.84 --> 00:47:25.72
He walks up the stairs and Hobbs and Moore was one of their best black belts.

1171
00:47:25.72 --> 00:47:27.56
He's like, I trialed him day one.

1172
00:47:27.56 --> 00:47:28.72
And they were all like, they were surprised.

1173
00:47:28.72 --> 00:47:30.76
He was a purple belt.

1174
00:47:30.76 --> 00:47:32.64
And then they were like talking shit.

1175
00:47:32.64 --> 00:47:34.56
They're like, oh, it was lucky.

1176
00:47:34.56 --> 00:47:35.56
He goes back the next day.

1177
00:47:35.56 --> 00:47:37.48
He's like, I trialed him again.

1178
00:47:37.48 --> 00:47:40.36
And then they gave him a brown belt and they're a competition heavy team.

1179
00:47:40.36 --> 00:47:42.68
And so they needed someone at black belt in the weight class.

1180
00:47:42.68 --> 00:47:44.56
They put him and he won.

1181
00:47:44.56 --> 00:47:48.64
And then I was there at purple belt the next year.

1182
00:47:48.64 --> 00:47:50.36
I think he won 2000.

1183
00:47:50.36 --> 00:47:52.24
So 2001 I was at purple belt.

1184
00:47:52.24 --> 00:47:53.72
They weren't going to let that happen again.

1185
00:47:53.72 --> 00:47:56.16
They're like, no way, dude.

1186
00:47:56.16 --> 00:48:00.48
They're like, you're not coming here and doing that again.

1187
00:48:00.48 --> 00:48:04.96
But people like you, if you're supposed to lose and you win, it's just like, if you're

1188
00:48:04.96 --> 00:48:06.36
a crowd favorite, people like you.

1189
00:48:06.36 --> 00:48:08.88
It doesn't matter what the medal says.

1190
00:48:08.88 --> 00:48:10.80
And I won a lot.

1191
00:48:10.80 --> 00:48:13.04
But then in Hawaii, it hurt my neck.

1192
00:48:13.04 --> 00:48:14.12
How'd you hurt your neck?

1193
00:48:14.12 --> 00:48:18.24
So we went to Sandy's beach, which is like a notorious beach for hurting people.

1194
00:48:18.24 --> 00:48:19.76
And BJ panning them.

1195
00:48:19.76 --> 00:48:22.12
You see, he'd leave me in control a lot.

1196
00:48:22.12 --> 00:48:26.40
When he'd go to Japan and stuff, like he would tell his brothers, Pete's in charge.

1197
00:48:26.40 --> 00:48:29.36
So it left me like, it's hilarious.

1198
00:48:29.36 --> 00:48:36.04
So you know, after some time, I ended up at this beach and I hurt my neck.

1199
00:48:36.04 --> 00:48:37.80
So that took me out of the competition scene.

1200
00:48:37.80 --> 00:48:38.80
There was one.

1201
00:48:38.80 --> 00:48:39.80
What happened to your neck?

1202
00:48:39.80 --> 00:48:42.92
I got slammed on my, I got body surfing.

1203
00:48:42.92 --> 00:48:45.12
I had no idea breakneck beach.

1204
00:48:45.12 --> 00:48:47.44
I had no idea that the most dangerous beach in the world.

1205
00:48:47.44 --> 00:48:49.20
They didn't tell me they're not going to tell you.

1206
00:48:49.20 --> 00:48:50.20
You know what I mean?

1207
00:48:50.20 --> 00:48:52.52
It's like, you're in a, you're in a room full of staff.

1208
00:48:52.52 --> 00:48:53.52
No one tells you.

1209
00:48:53.52 --> 00:48:57.000
So I was like, yeah, you know, just lay on that couch.

1210
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
So it's the same.

1211
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000
That was a jab at me.

1212
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.04
I don't know if you guys knew that was a no side jab at me.

1213
00:49:01.04 --> 00:49:03.76
He thinks all my couches have ringworm and staff on it.

1214
00:49:03.76 --> 00:49:04.76
Fuck you, man.

1215
00:49:04.76 --> 00:49:09.80
He didn't train on me, but MMA people, when you go to their house and you sleep on one

1216
00:49:09.80 --> 00:49:11.64
of their couches, like it's like a joke.

1217
00:49:11.64 --> 00:49:14.72
They're like, yeah, you can stay here as long as you want to stay on that couch.

1218
00:49:14.72 --> 00:49:15.72
It's like a joke.

1219
00:49:15.72 --> 00:49:19.76
Cause you know, like day four, dude's just going to be itching everyone.

1220
00:49:19.76 --> 00:49:20.76
Wow.

1221
00:49:20.76 --> 00:49:23.12
I haven't had ringworm or staff in years.

1222
00:49:23.12 --> 00:49:24.88
No, man, saying it, Jeff doesn't do MMA.

1223
00:49:24.88 --> 00:49:25.88
It's crazy.

1224
00:49:25.88 --> 00:49:27.16
MMA fighters from back in the day.

1225
00:49:27.16 --> 00:49:30.56
I'm not telling, Jeff is clean and he's a, he's a great friend.

1226
00:49:30.56 --> 00:49:32.56
He's a conservative American.

1227
00:49:32.56 --> 00:49:36.36
Well, I've personally witnessed Jeff kick people off the mat for doing whatever kind

1228
00:49:36.36 --> 00:49:39.08
of stuff that, that was a non hygienic.

1229
00:49:39.08 --> 00:49:40.72
Jeff's great.

1230
00:49:40.72 --> 00:49:43.84
So what was the injury to your neck?

1231
00:49:43.84 --> 00:49:50.96
So I get slammed on my neck and I was like, fuck dude, I thought I was paralyzed.

1232
00:49:50.96 --> 00:49:55.000
And I, man, those little guys, I heard some people laugh and I started getting pissed.

1233
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.56
BJ Penn grabbed me out of the ocean cause they think it's funny.

1234
00:49:57.56 --> 00:50:05.000
Like if you, if you get hurt at first kind of, and not being hurt, you know, end up being

1235
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
like injury.

1236
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.12
There's an entire series of movies called jackass, which is literally about that right

1237
00:50:09.12 --> 00:50:10.12
there.

1238
00:50:10.12 --> 00:50:12.96
And my friend came up to me and he's like, you know, anytime you want to come back here,

1239
00:50:12.96 --> 00:50:14.36
we'll build a house for you.

1240
00:50:14.36 --> 00:50:17.96
They're just like, they're happy that took it like a man because most people are going

1241
00:50:17.96 --> 00:50:20.84
to be, and I still stayed there for months, like four or five months.

1242
00:50:20.84 --> 00:50:21.84
Did you get surgery?

1243
00:50:21.84 --> 00:50:22.84
Did you get a neck brace?

1244
00:50:22.84 --> 00:50:23.84
What was that?

1245
00:50:23.84 --> 00:50:25.08
Yeah, it was just, it sucks so bad.

1246
00:50:25.08 --> 00:50:26.08
I ended up taking my fight against.

1247
00:50:26.08 --> 00:50:27.08
Did you get numbness in your arms?

1248
00:50:27.08 --> 00:50:28.68
Oh, it was, it was fucked up.

1249
00:50:28.68 --> 00:50:31.28
At first when I got hit, I was completely numb.

1250
00:50:31.28 --> 00:50:32.44
I thought I was paralyzed.

1251
00:50:32.44 --> 00:50:35.04
I was like, I hit it and I was like, whoa.

1252
00:50:35.04 --> 00:50:36.68
And then I usually shake something off.

1253
00:50:36.68 --> 00:50:37.68
I was like, whoa.

1254
00:50:37.68 --> 00:50:39.84
Like, whoa, I'm paralyzed.

1255
00:50:39.84 --> 00:50:41.64
This sucks.

1256
00:50:41.64 --> 00:50:43.36
I'm like, this sucks.

1257
00:50:43.36 --> 00:50:46.12
And I kind of like started accepting it.

1258
00:50:46.12 --> 00:50:51.80
And then I thought about, well, one girl when I was 18 years old, I traveled to Cancun,

1259
00:50:51.80 --> 00:50:55.20
one of my best friends, she died in an ocean undertow and they call me crying.

1260
00:50:55.20 --> 00:50:56.20
Like we lost an ocean.

1261
00:50:56.20 --> 00:50:57.20
I go out there, I find her.

1262
00:50:57.20 --> 00:51:02.16
Just when I was 18, we were on the news and everything in Chicago came back.

1263
00:51:02.16 --> 00:51:06.64
Anyways, first thing I thought of when I thought of her when I got paralyzed, I thought

1264
00:51:06.64 --> 00:51:11.40
of her, I was like, whoa, I was like back in the ocean again, like fuck, I'm paralyzed.

1265
00:51:11.40 --> 00:51:12.40
This sucks.

1266
00:51:12.40 --> 00:51:14.56
And I heard these fuckers laughing.

1267
00:51:14.56 --> 00:51:15.80
And then I felt the pain in calm.

1268
00:51:15.80 --> 00:51:17.40
It was the best pain in my life.

1269
00:51:17.40 --> 00:51:19.04
It was like real pain.

1270
00:51:19.04 --> 00:51:22.04
I was like, and I look at BJ Penn.

1271
00:51:22.04 --> 00:51:24.64
I'm like, I'm hurt, my friend.

1272
00:51:24.64 --> 00:51:26.72
He's like, he looks at me, grabs me up.

1273
00:51:26.72 --> 00:51:27.72
He felt like bad.

1274
00:51:27.72 --> 00:51:29.72
He felt so fucking bad.

1275
00:51:29.72 --> 00:51:31.56
And he grabs me out and his friends didn't know any about it.

1276
00:51:31.56 --> 00:51:33.12
I used to smash them all day.

1277
00:51:33.12 --> 00:51:35.80
It was like purple belts, just random Hawaiians.

1278
00:51:35.80 --> 00:51:37.84
I'd smash the shit out of them.

1279
00:51:37.84 --> 00:51:39.84
They were so happy.

1280
00:51:39.84 --> 00:51:41.84
Random Hawaiians is great.

1281
00:51:41.84 --> 00:51:46.28
I'm just saying, I was there for BJ Penn.

1282
00:51:46.28 --> 00:51:47.28
I wasn't there.

1283
00:51:47.28 --> 00:51:49.44
Like these guys are just like adrenaline dudes.

1284
00:51:49.44 --> 00:51:54.80
Like they're the type of guys that show up when you win and they run when you lose.

1285
00:51:54.80 --> 00:51:55.80
You know what I mean?

1286
00:51:55.80 --> 00:51:57.64
And he knows that I'm talking about BJ Penn, my good friends.

1287
00:51:57.64 --> 00:51:59.000
So it was like those type of friends.

1288
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.80
They weren't like top-notch friends.

1289
00:52:01.80 --> 00:52:04.20
So now you can't, how long before you train?

1290
00:52:04.20 --> 00:52:07.000
I go back to Chicago.

1291
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.12
I'm pissed.

1292
00:52:09.12 --> 00:52:12.56
I was Pete the Greek, Brazilian Hawaiian back in Chicago.

1293
00:52:12.56 --> 00:52:13.56
I was like, fuck.

1294
00:52:13.56 --> 00:52:15.44
Carlson has lost his team.

1295
00:52:15.44 --> 00:52:16.44
He was like, fuck.

1296
00:52:16.44 --> 00:52:17.44
We became best friends.

1297
00:52:17.44 --> 00:52:20.04
We were just like, whoa.

1298
00:52:20.04 --> 00:52:22.08
We're like, we need to gather ourselves.

1299
00:52:22.08 --> 00:52:26.48
Like he's on the phone calling like the shoot box coach, which was the other best team that

1300
00:52:26.48 --> 00:52:27.68
hated top teams.

1301
00:52:27.68 --> 00:52:29.80
Like telling him how to dismantle everyone.

1302
00:52:29.80 --> 00:52:33.80
He's like, yeah, if you're fighting like this guy, be nice to Minotaro.

1303
00:52:33.80 --> 00:52:35.20
Because he wasn't a bad guy.

1304
00:52:35.20 --> 00:52:39.52
But he just telling him how to dismantle these people and call him up.

1305
00:52:39.52 --> 00:52:40.52
And it was just funny.

1306
00:52:40.52 --> 00:52:41.52
Carlson was great.

1307
00:52:41.52 --> 00:52:45.08
And we would study MMA videos every night.

1308
00:52:45.08 --> 00:52:49.56
And not like, like, however, how Jeff and I studied Jitsu, we study MMA and we watched

1309
00:52:49.56 --> 00:52:50.56
Fedor and everything.

1310
00:52:50.56 --> 00:52:52.08
I had Carlson, what do you do here?

1311
00:52:52.08 --> 00:52:54.20
And you stop it and explain it.

1312
00:52:54.20 --> 00:52:56.32
And then I start learning.

1313
00:52:56.32 --> 00:52:58.32
And then we met Stefan Bonner.

1314
00:52:58.32 --> 00:53:01.24
Stefan Bonner walks in as a blue belt.

1315
00:53:01.24 --> 00:53:04.52
And like Carlson, like fuck it.

1316
00:53:04.52 --> 00:53:07.68
Just put this guy to fight, you know?

1317
00:53:07.68 --> 00:53:10.64
Big guy, strong guy, tough guy.

1318
00:53:10.64 --> 00:53:12.60
We taught him to Kimura.

1319
00:53:12.60 --> 00:53:13.80
And UFC calls up.

1320
00:53:13.80 --> 00:53:15.88
We're like, hey, put him in.

1321
00:53:15.88 --> 00:53:19.60
Because Carlson, like that type of person, like people that think are really big, Carlson

1322
00:53:19.60 --> 00:53:24.12
was talking to him like a kid, like Dana Weich, you know?

1323
00:53:24.12 --> 00:53:25.92
Put him in.

1324
00:53:25.92 --> 00:53:28.12
And Stefan changed the whole damn game.

1325
00:53:28.12 --> 00:53:34.28
Well, of course, VTOR did before, but UFC got boring until Ultimate Fighter came out.

1326
00:53:34.28 --> 00:53:37.96
And then that's why Dana Weich and all of them, they love me.

1327
00:53:37.96 --> 00:53:41.60
And when Dana Weich comes to Chicago, he takes Gibson's.

1328
00:53:41.60 --> 00:53:45.84
Every time he shows up, he gets a wine from my friend from Pete to Greek, like automatic.

1329
00:53:45.84 --> 00:53:48.52
Like he's had him like 50 times.

1330
00:53:48.52 --> 00:53:52.76
So we go in there, Stefan, like blue belt, knows one move.

1331
00:53:52.76 --> 00:53:58.32
It feels like the fight of whatever, the sentry against Forrest Griffin, because when you

1332
00:53:58.32 --> 00:54:01.44
fight against Carlson guys, you have Carlson staring at you.

1333
00:54:01.44 --> 00:54:05.60
So he's like, he's not a mean guy, but he's a spiritual guy.

1334
00:54:05.60 --> 00:54:09.04
So it's like, you're just like, fuck, I'm fucked.

1335
00:54:09.04 --> 00:54:10.68
You're fighting that guy.

1336
00:54:10.68 --> 00:54:12.20
You'll find the whole history.

1337
00:54:12.20 --> 00:54:13.20
It's everything.

1338
00:54:13.20 --> 00:54:14.64
And Stefan, he knew enough.

1339
00:54:14.64 --> 00:54:19.64
He did the Golden Globes boxing, knew the Kimura, and he was strong.

1340
00:54:19.64 --> 00:54:24.36
If you grab that damn Kimura, your arms getting ripped off.

1341
00:54:24.36 --> 00:54:25.92
And he did that.

1342
00:54:25.92 --> 00:54:27.24
He changed the whole game.

1343
00:54:27.24 --> 00:54:28.92
The UFC went from rags of riches.

1344
00:54:28.92 --> 00:54:30.36
They were dying.

1345
00:54:30.36 --> 00:54:32.20
Now everyone watching it again.

1346
00:54:32.20 --> 00:54:34.12
UFC's huge.

1347
00:54:34.12 --> 00:54:37.12
People are buying paper views.

1348
00:54:37.12 --> 00:54:38.64
And that's what I did when I was in Chicago.

1349
00:54:38.64 --> 00:54:41.08
And Miguel Torres came too.

1350
00:54:41.08 --> 00:54:43.24
We helped him out.

1351
00:54:43.24 --> 00:54:47.40
And then he won the WEC.

1352
00:54:47.40 --> 00:54:50.000
And that's when Dominic Cruz took over his weight class.

1353
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.44
So it's all related.

1354
00:54:51.44 --> 00:54:53.40
And then I became from the Dominic Cruz's.

1355
00:54:53.40 --> 00:54:56.12
It's all like, those are the smaller guys.

1356
00:54:56.12 --> 00:54:57.72
Those are the smart guys.

1357
00:54:57.72 --> 00:55:00.16
When did you open your academy?

1358
00:55:00.16 --> 00:55:01.32
So I had surgery.

1359
00:55:01.32 --> 00:55:04.24
Mark Coleman, I'm over there at Cobra Kai.

1360
00:55:04.24 --> 00:55:06.72
Because for the Ultimate Fighter, I was like their bodyguard.

1361
00:55:06.72 --> 00:55:07.16
It was funny.

1362
00:55:07.16 --> 00:55:08.64
I'm not a big guy, but they like me.

1363
00:55:08.64 --> 00:55:10.48
So Stefan invites me.

1364
00:55:10.48 --> 00:55:13.92
And so all the guys, Chris Lieben, they're all there.

1365
00:55:13.92 --> 00:55:15.48
And I'm in the limo with them.

1366
00:55:15.48 --> 00:55:18.04
And it was for the Ultimate Fighter Caesar 1.

1367
00:55:18.04 --> 00:55:21.44
And it was like for the grand finale.

1368
00:55:21.44 --> 00:55:23.52
So we're all at layman's Cobra Kai.

1369
00:55:23.52 --> 00:55:25.64
And what's his name tells me?

1370
00:55:25.64 --> 00:55:26.48
What's that big wrestler?

1371
00:55:26.48 --> 00:55:26.92
Mark Coleman.

1372
00:55:26.92 --> 00:55:28.56
He's like, hey, Pete DeGreer.

1373
00:55:28.56 --> 00:55:30.56
I just had back surgery at Dr. Joe.

1374
00:55:30.56 --> 00:55:31.68
It's a guy in Pittsburgh.

1375
00:55:31.68 --> 00:55:34.72
And I show up there and the guy fixes my neck.

1376
00:55:34.72 --> 00:55:36.28
He does like to dissect me.

1377
00:55:36.28 --> 00:55:37.80
He's like a sniper.

1378
00:55:37.80 --> 00:55:38.40
He'll fix you.

1379
00:55:38.40 --> 00:55:40.08
So I go there.

1380
00:55:40.08 --> 00:55:41.80
And I'm like, yeah, I'm here for Mark Coleman.

1381
00:55:41.80 --> 00:55:43.72
He fixed my neck.

1382
00:55:43.72 --> 00:55:48.48
But I didn't want to compete again.

1383
00:55:48.48 --> 00:55:49.84
I said, shoot.

1384
00:55:49.84 --> 00:55:52.60
I'm like one injury from being away from homeless.

1385
00:55:52.60 --> 00:55:54.48
I better open a gym.

1386
00:55:54.48 --> 00:55:56.12
It was like I'm looking for shelter.

1387
00:55:56.12 --> 00:55:57.56
Like, where do I go?

1388
00:55:57.56 --> 00:55:58.56
Who can I trust?

1389
00:55:58.56 --> 00:56:00.16
I'm back in Chicago.

1390
00:56:00.16 --> 00:56:02.40
Like I was even in Brazil.

1391
00:56:02.40 --> 00:56:04.56
Shoot, Rio de Janeiro, Hawaii.

1392
00:56:04.56 --> 00:56:07.32
Now I'm back in Chicago with a broken neck.

1393
00:56:07.32 --> 00:56:09.32
People are laughing at me.

1394
00:56:09.32 --> 00:56:12.32
Like I went and worked in the ghetto in Chicago.

1395
00:56:12.32 --> 00:56:13.68
Doing what?

1396
00:56:13.68 --> 00:56:15.80
So my friends, they're getting all happy.

1397
00:56:15.80 --> 00:56:18.12
Like, we knew you'd end up getting hurt.

1398
00:56:18.12 --> 00:56:21.000
I'm like, you fucking assholes.

1399
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.84
And you got hurt from the body surface.

1400
00:56:22.84 --> 00:56:23.56
You know what I mean?

1401
00:56:23.56 --> 00:56:25.24
But it doesn't matter that people see you.

1402
00:56:25.24 --> 00:56:27.60
Like you got hurt from that jujitsu.

1403
00:56:27.60 --> 00:56:29.24
I'm like, oh, OK.

1404
00:56:29.24 --> 00:56:31.80
I'm like, yeah, I'm here to work a job.

1405
00:56:31.80 --> 00:56:33.28
And so I got my real estate license.

1406
00:56:33.28 --> 00:56:36.36
And I was working for my friends doing section eight housing.

1407
00:56:36.36 --> 00:56:38.12
So I'd pick up people from the projects.

1408
00:56:38.12 --> 00:56:41.68
They would turn on the products and bring them to apartments.

1409
00:56:41.68 --> 00:56:43.80
And I was like, fuck, dude.

1410
00:56:43.80 --> 00:56:46.40
I don't want to do this.

1411
00:56:46.40 --> 00:56:49.88
And then it was in bed.

1412
00:56:49.88 --> 00:56:51.28
But I'm a jujitsu guy.

1413
00:56:51.28 --> 00:56:53.36
Like I'm having to like really, like I'm like,

1414
00:56:53.36 --> 00:56:55.000
I don't want to really have to use jujitsu.

1415
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.36
I want to like, I don't know what I'm going to do.

1416
00:56:57.36 --> 00:56:59.96
So I opened up this little gym.

1417
00:56:59.96 --> 00:57:00.88
Like a real little one.

1418
00:57:00.88 --> 00:57:01.64
Glover came.

1419
00:57:01.64 --> 00:57:03.28
He was in a sketchy neighborhood.

1420
00:57:03.28 --> 00:57:04.52
I remember Glover's first day.

1421
00:57:04.52 --> 00:57:06.36
Like the guy comes in.

1422
00:57:06.36 --> 00:57:07.64
Glover's on the door waiting for him.

1423
00:57:07.64 --> 00:57:08.92
He's like, y'all do tap out?

1424
00:57:08.92 --> 00:57:10.44
Because I had a tap outside.

1425
00:57:10.44 --> 00:57:11.64
Y'all do tap out?

1426
00:57:11.64 --> 00:57:12.20
Remember that Glover?

1427
00:57:12.20 --> 00:57:13.72
Wait, that's what Glover said when he walked in?

1428
00:57:13.72 --> 00:57:15.36
The guy that seemed Glover outside the thing.

1429
00:57:15.36 --> 00:57:16.84
Remember the first day outside my gym?

1430
00:57:16.84 --> 00:57:17.68
He remember that.

1431
00:57:17.68 --> 00:57:18.84
Because I had a big tap out sign.

1432
00:57:18.84 --> 00:57:21.20
So people in Chicago thought that I did.

1433
00:57:21.20 --> 00:57:23.24
They thought jujitsu is called tap out.

1434
00:57:23.24 --> 00:57:24.48
It's crazy.

1435
00:57:24.48 --> 00:57:27.64
So then I opened up this little gym.

1436
00:57:27.64 --> 00:57:31.24
Everyone's telling me, you know, you're going to get shot.

1437
00:57:31.24 --> 00:57:33.72
I'm like, yeah, right, dude.

1438
00:57:33.72 --> 00:57:37.60
I open up the gym and bam, I get my best friends, best

1439
00:57:37.60 --> 00:57:38.60
students right from there.

1440
00:57:38.60 --> 00:57:39.28
They're so cool.

1441
00:57:39.28 --> 00:57:40.96
Because right on North Avenue and Western,

1442
00:57:40.96 --> 00:57:42.88
the two biggest streets in Chicago.

1443
00:57:42.88 --> 00:57:46.08
So pretty much everyone can get there from the South side

1444
00:57:46.08 --> 00:57:49.56
and North side, from downtown, from everywhere.

1445
00:57:49.56 --> 00:57:51.92
There's a little gym like 600 square feet.

1446
00:57:51.92 --> 00:57:54.96
And man, I mean, my best friends from there,

1447
00:57:54.96 --> 00:57:55.76
they knew I was hurt.

1448
00:57:55.76 --> 00:57:59.64
I told them straight up, I'm like, look, my neck is hurt.

1449
00:57:59.64 --> 00:58:01.28
I'm like, you guys just got to get good.

1450
00:58:01.28 --> 00:58:02.24
I'm going to tell you what to do.

1451
00:58:02.24 --> 00:58:03.20
I'm not going to fight you.

1452
00:58:03.20 --> 00:58:05.16
Just learn how to listen.

1453
00:58:05.16 --> 00:58:07.48
And man, we got a lot of students in there.

1454
00:58:07.48 --> 00:58:08.76
It was crazy.

1455
00:58:08.76 --> 00:58:10.28
Like cars parked outside.

1456
00:58:10.28 --> 00:58:11.80
And next thing you know, all my friends

1457
00:58:11.80 --> 00:58:13.12
are open up gyms next to me.

1458
00:58:13.12 --> 00:58:14.80
I'm like, oh, thanks.

1459
00:58:14.80 --> 00:58:16.12
You guys are great friends.

1460
00:58:16.12 --> 00:58:18.96
Like you see businesses going great.

1461
00:58:18.96 --> 00:58:24.36
And shoot, gym got big.

1462
00:58:24.36 --> 00:58:27.44
Kid students, I open up a giant gym.

1463
00:58:27.44 --> 00:58:31.28
And things are going great.

1464
00:58:31.28 --> 00:58:32.92
Glover then came to my giant gym.

1465
00:58:32.92 --> 00:58:35.32
I always have Glover out for, he's always about, I'm like,

1466
00:58:35.32 --> 00:58:36.44
guys, we're having a seminar.

1467
00:58:36.44 --> 00:58:38.96
Like what did you guys meet for the first time?

1468
00:58:38.96 --> 00:58:39.72
Like with Scotty.

1469
00:58:39.72 --> 00:58:40.84
That was through Scotty.

1470
00:58:40.84 --> 00:58:41.76
Everything Scotty.

1471
00:58:41.76 --> 00:58:42.72
Everything Scotty.

1472
00:58:42.72 --> 00:58:45.24
I would have never been.

1473
00:58:45.24 --> 00:58:47.32
Scotty taught me how to be a California boy.

1474
00:58:47.32 --> 00:58:49.28
I was just like Chicago, like cold winter,

1475
00:58:49.28 --> 00:58:50.04
that and anything.

1476
00:58:50.04 --> 00:58:53.68
I'm like, yeah, I just need to smash and win and fight.

1477
00:58:53.68 --> 00:58:56.44
And then Scotty shows you like surfing.

1478
00:58:56.44 --> 00:58:58.20
He shows you everything.

1479
00:58:58.20 --> 00:59:00.08
How to roll a joint, stuff like that.

1480
00:59:00.08 --> 00:59:04.80
Scotty had one of those scooters, like a quick scooter

1481
00:59:04.80 --> 00:59:05.40
in Brazil.

1482
00:59:05.40 --> 00:59:07.52
And we would just go like, you're going like 40 miles now

1483
00:59:07.52 --> 00:59:10.24
on a scooter, he had the first digital camera.

1484
00:59:10.24 --> 00:59:12.52
Scotty's like from the future.

1485
00:59:12.52 --> 00:59:13.44
Back then.

1486
00:59:13.44 --> 00:59:15.68
Now I don't know, because now he's with the hospital stuff.

1487
00:59:15.68 --> 00:59:16.96
I haven't spent too much time with him.

1488
00:59:16.96 --> 00:59:18.52
But back then he was from the future.

1489
00:59:18.52 --> 00:59:20.92
He'd teach us all this stuff.

1490
00:59:20.92 --> 00:59:23.96
And man, Hawaii, Brazil, everywhere.

1491
00:59:23.96 --> 00:59:25.16
I go back to Chicago.

1492
00:59:25.16 --> 00:59:28.000
It's kind of like, it's like a community service.

1493
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.56
Like I'm really helping out people.

1494
00:59:31.56 --> 00:59:33.000
Chicago is like a barter system.

1495
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.20
It's like a third world country.

1496
00:59:34.20 --> 00:59:36.12
People don't want to pay you that much.

1497
00:59:36.12 --> 00:59:37.88
They'd rather just barter you.

1498
00:59:37.88 --> 00:59:40.12
And it works out good because everyone there has

1499
00:59:40.12 --> 00:59:42.04
like connections to this and that.

1500
00:59:42.04 --> 00:59:44.12
And this guy owns that place.

1501
00:59:44.12 --> 00:59:45.84
He owns a restaurant.

1502
00:59:45.84 --> 00:59:47.04
You know, if you try and charge him,

1503
00:59:47.04 --> 00:59:48.28
you end up getting less.

1504
00:59:48.28 --> 00:59:50.92
So you're like, hey, everyone trains for free.

1505
00:59:50.92 --> 00:59:53.48
So my gym people pretty much pay.

1506
00:59:53.48 --> 00:59:56.32
It's like, here, you don't charge people that much, Jaco.

1507
00:59:56.32 --> 00:59:57.92
No, we try and keep it.

1508
00:59:57.92 --> 00:59:59.56
We try and keep it so people can come in.

1509
00:59:59.56 --> 01:00:01.52
And I don't have overhead like you.

1510
01:00:01.52 --> 01:00:03.44
Yeah, I've overhead much lower.

1511
01:00:03.44 --> 01:00:06.24
And so it's like, dude, I know if you have money,

1512
01:00:06.24 --> 01:00:08.68
I know if, you know, like pay what you think you should.

1513
01:00:08.68 --> 01:00:10.48
Like, you know, if there's food in the kitchen,

1514
01:00:10.48 --> 01:00:12.28
eat what you deserve.

1515
01:00:12.28 --> 01:00:14.64
And my guys understand that.

1516
01:00:14.64 --> 01:00:16.48
And I could make a lot more money being there,

1517
01:00:16.48 --> 01:00:18.60
but I wouldn't be in Jiu-Jitsu.

1518
01:00:18.60 --> 01:00:21.52
Like I'm doing Jiu-Jitsu as service with the Glover,

1519
01:00:21.52 --> 01:00:25.12
with the Ritolos, with BJ Penn, all these people.

1520
01:00:25.12 --> 01:00:27.36
I'm doing a higher service.

1521
01:00:27.36 --> 01:00:30.000
I could be at home teaching white belts.

1522
01:00:30.92 --> 01:00:32.52
And they might quit in a few months.

1523
01:00:32.52 --> 01:00:33.68
They might win a tournament.

1524
01:00:33.68 --> 01:00:37.72
And I can make a lot more money for sure, 100%.

1525
01:00:37.72 --> 01:00:40.48
But if I'm looking at it from service,

1526
01:00:40.48 --> 01:00:43.40
like we help the whole world.

1527
01:00:43.40 --> 01:00:44.88
We're all over the place.

1528
01:00:44.88 --> 01:00:46.60
The weed is better in California.

1529
01:00:47.56 --> 01:00:48.48
And cheaper.

1530
01:00:50.04 --> 01:00:50.88
And legal, right?

1531
01:00:50.88 --> 01:00:51.72
Is it legal in Chicago?

1532
01:00:51.72 --> 01:00:53.24
That's a big part of it, yeah.

1533
01:00:53.24 --> 01:00:57.48
Chicago, you go to the store, it's like 40% Texas, you know?

1534
01:00:57.48 --> 01:01:00.16
And yeah, I love Chicago.

1535
01:01:00.16 --> 01:01:03.36
I love that place, but with my broken neck,

1536
01:01:03.36 --> 01:01:06.56
see I got hit by, okay, so I opened up the giant gym.

1537
01:01:06.56 --> 01:01:09.80
Bam, Glover comes over, like who are we doing a seminar with?

1538
01:01:09.80 --> 01:01:11.36
Jeff Glover, I'm like, yeah, again,

1539
01:01:11.36 --> 01:01:14.16
every seminar is with Glover at my school.

1540
01:01:14.16 --> 01:01:17.48
Like, it's just the way it is.

1541
01:01:17.48 --> 01:01:19.76
And so we had a couple other ones,

1542
01:01:19.76 --> 01:01:22.88
but most of them like eight out of 10 seminars are with Jeff.

1543
01:01:22.88 --> 01:01:23.72
And-

1544
01:01:23.72 --> 01:01:27.44
The sickest I ever got was one of the seminars

1545
01:01:27.44 --> 01:01:28.76
I did at your school.

1546
01:01:28.76 --> 01:01:30.04
You took me to-

1547
01:01:30.04 --> 01:01:30.88
The Burger King.

1548
01:01:30.88 --> 01:01:33.88
You took me to Burger King twice on the same day.

1549
01:01:33.88 --> 01:01:34.72
That's not how it was.

1550
01:01:34.72 --> 01:01:36.84
Yeah, it was coming out of both ends.

1551
01:01:36.84 --> 01:01:39.08
And I was, you know, Pete's like,

1552
01:01:39.08 --> 01:01:40.16
you all right in there Glover?

1553
01:01:40.16 --> 01:01:42.08
I was like, I hate you, man.

1554
01:01:42.08 --> 01:01:44.20
I'm down in this basement, you know?

1555
01:01:44.20 --> 01:01:47.16
Like I got a great home back in San Diego waiting for me.

1556
01:01:47.16 --> 01:01:48.72
And like this place was here.

1557
01:01:48.72 --> 01:01:50.80
And I'm like in Pete's basement,

1558
01:01:50.80 --> 01:01:52.96
vomiting, I can just taste the like chicken.

1559
01:01:52.96 --> 01:01:53.80
Remember chicken fries?

1560
01:01:53.80 --> 01:01:54.64
It's chicken fries.

1561
01:01:54.64 --> 01:01:56.28
Oh, damn, I ate that shit.

1562
01:01:56.28 --> 01:01:57.12
This is gross.

1563
01:01:57.12 --> 01:01:57.96
Oh, it was bad, yeah.

1564
01:01:57.96 --> 01:01:59.80
That's when, whenever Pete talks about the shit,

1565
01:01:59.80 --> 01:02:01.04
that's all I ever think about.

1566
01:02:01.04 --> 01:02:04.64
So, Jeff, that was the closest I ever felt to death, dude.

1567
01:02:04.64 --> 01:02:05.48
Let me tell you what happened.

1568
01:02:05.48 --> 01:02:08.000
I said, Jeff comes over, I'm feeling great.

1569
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And drunk drivers hit me and break my neck again and my back.

1570
01:02:13.40 --> 01:02:15.68
And then I was just like,

1571
01:02:15.68 --> 01:02:16.84
I can't live here anymore.

1572
01:02:16.84 --> 01:02:17.88
It's too cold.

1573
01:02:17.88 --> 01:02:19.28
And then I went and lived with Glover.

1574
01:02:19.28 --> 01:02:20.56
Glover, would you used to call him?

1575
01:02:20.56 --> 01:02:22.76
You were my therapist.

1576
01:02:22.76 --> 01:02:24.04
Did I? I don't remember that.

1577
01:02:24.04 --> 01:02:26.000
Yeah, you're my physical therapist.

1578
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.24
So then I met you guys.

1579
01:02:27.24 --> 01:02:30.52
So, Jeff, when you started,

1580
01:02:32.20 --> 01:02:34.32
when you started like competing for real,

1581
01:02:34.32 --> 01:02:37.08
like now you're like, no,

1582
01:02:37.08 --> 01:02:39.96
when you started doing the worlds

1583
01:02:39.96 --> 01:02:42.56
and it's like 2007, 2008,

1584
01:02:42.56 --> 01:02:44.36
what's your life like at this point?

1585
01:02:44.36 --> 01:02:46.76
What's your training schedule looking like?

1586
01:02:46.76 --> 01:02:49.04
It's just Jiu Jitsu, Jiu Jitsu, Jiu Jitsu, right?

1587
01:02:49.04 --> 01:02:51.52
I mean, the Jiu Jitsu was the only thing

1588
01:02:51.52 --> 01:02:53.36
that was not chaotic.

1589
01:02:54.96 --> 01:02:56.60
Well, what's chaotic?

1590
01:02:56.60 --> 01:03:01.32
I mean, just life, social life, family life, finances.

1591
01:03:01.32 --> 01:03:02.16
Where do you live?

1592
01:03:02.16 --> 01:03:03.000
Where are you living during this time?

1593
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.24
I mean, like, I live,

1594
01:03:05.24 --> 01:03:08.36
Joe Stevenson let me live in his place for like two months.

1595
01:03:08.36 --> 01:03:09.20
Big daddy.

1596
01:03:09.20 --> 01:03:10.20
I mean, I was living all over.

1597
01:03:10.20 --> 01:03:12.08
I was living in all these places.

1598
01:03:12.08 --> 01:03:15.12
And your whole existence is just a trained Jiu Jitsu.

1599
01:03:17.04 --> 01:03:18.32
Yeah, pretty much.

1600
01:03:18.32 --> 01:03:22.44
Are you still with Franjia this whole time?

1601
01:03:22.44 --> 01:03:24.000
I went between, I started,

1602
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.52
this is where I started realizing

1603
01:03:25.52 --> 01:03:28.24
that like this one place thing wasn't for me.

1604
01:03:28.24 --> 01:03:30.40
That just being with Franjia wasn't gonna cut it.

1605
01:03:30.40 --> 01:03:35.40
And Mark Lehman was already a big influence to me,

1606
01:03:35.56 --> 01:03:36.72
making those videos.

1607
01:03:36.72 --> 01:03:39.36
Mark Lehman was the first YouTube, you know?

1608
01:03:39.36 --> 01:03:40.20
And,

1609
01:03:40.20 --> 01:03:42.28
Where's Mark Lehman from right now?

1610
01:03:42.28 --> 01:03:44.72
He went back home to Michigan.

1611
01:03:44.72 --> 01:03:45.76
Does he have a school out there?

1612
01:03:45.76 --> 01:03:47.88
Yeah, yeah, he's all low-key though.

1613
01:03:47.88 --> 01:03:49.52
And no Instagram, nothing.

1614
01:03:49.52 --> 01:03:50.44
He was a beast.

1615
01:03:50.44 --> 01:03:52.000
But he was very influential.

1616
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.84
And it's cool because I get to say

1617
01:03:53.84 --> 01:03:55.76
I trained with Mark and Dean.

1618
01:03:55.76 --> 01:03:57.16
Because Mark and Dean were the two big.

1619
01:03:57.16 --> 01:03:59.20
It was like who were the best Americans at the time?

1620
01:03:59.20 --> 01:04:01.44
It was always Mark Lehman and Dean Lister.

1621
01:04:01.44 --> 01:04:02.28
And they fought.

1622
01:04:02.28 --> 01:04:03.28
And I got to be,

1623
01:04:03.28 --> 01:04:05.64
I've spent so much time with both those guys.

1624
01:04:05.64 --> 01:04:08.04
And yeah, I started doing the Mark thing.

1625
01:04:08.04 --> 01:04:10.72
And I told Franjia, Mark offered me a job in Las Vegas,

1626
01:04:10.72 --> 01:04:12.000
a full-time teaching job.

1627
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.80
It was my first full-time teaching job.

1628
01:04:13.80 --> 01:04:16.52
And Franjia's school, it was like,

1629
01:04:16.52 --> 01:04:18.72
Franjia, can you match what Mark's offering me?

1630
01:04:18.72 --> 01:04:20.76
And he was like, sorry, boy, I can't.

1631
01:04:20.76 --> 01:04:22.56
If you wanna keep assisting me for free,

1632
01:04:22.56 --> 01:04:24.80
that's cool, and I was like, well, I think I'm a man.

1633
01:04:24.80 --> 01:04:27.64
So I went to Mark Lehman and when Franjia gave him

1634
01:04:27.64 --> 01:04:30.68
my black belt, he tied it around my waist.

1635
01:04:30.68 --> 01:04:33.32
And I had already told him, I was making the move.

1636
01:04:33.32 --> 01:04:35.36
And in my ear, he was like,

1637
01:04:35.36 --> 01:04:38.20
boy, go show those guys how we do the Paragon Jiu-Jitsu

1638
01:04:38.20 --> 01:04:39.04
in the Las Vegas.

1639
01:04:39.04 --> 01:04:40.36
I'm proud of you.

1640
01:04:40.36 --> 01:04:41.20
You know what I'm saying?

1641
01:04:41.20 --> 01:04:43.88
He was like, you welcome back any time, boy.

1642
01:04:43.88 --> 01:04:44.72
You know what I'm saying?

1643
01:04:44.72 --> 01:04:48.000
So I started going between those two places.

1644
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.04
And actually, that's when I started hanging out

1645
01:04:50.04 --> 01:04:51.44
with Rudy.

1646
01:04:51.44 --> 01:04:52.80
That's when I met Rudy at tournaments.

1647
01:04:52.80 --> 01:04:55.16
And Rudy would, I would come visit Rudy.

1648
01:04:55.16 --> 01:04:57.40
And that's how I started making friends with all you guys.

1649
01:04:57.40 --> 01:04:58.24
Right on.

1650
01:04:58.24 --> 01:04:59.08
You know?

1651
01:04:59.08 --> 01:05:02.28
And it was like, yeah.

1652
01:05:02.28 --> 01:05:05.24
How many hours a day are you training at this time period?

1653
01:05:06.40 --> 01:05:11.40
I mean, I would train in every class I would teach

1654
01:05:11.40 --> 01:05:13.32
and I would take Mark's classes, yeah.

1655
01:05:13.32 --> 01:05:16.24
So it was still, it was still, until recently,

1656
01:05:16.24 --> 01:05:18.52
it was like, you know, four times a day every day.

1657
01:05:18.52 --> 01:05:21.40
And eight to 10 hours on the mat.

1658
01:05:22.72 --> 01:05:24.32
We take naps though.

1659
01:05:24.32 --> 01:05:27.12
How many hours a day are the rotolos on the mat right now?

1660
01:05:27.12 --> 01:05:28.88
Like we gotta take naps once in a while.

1661
01:05:28.88 --> 01:05:30.28
Frequent cat naps, yeah.

1662
01:05:30.28 --> 01:05:31.80
And then they gotta be in nature.

1663
01:05:31.80 --> 01:05:33.76
I think nowadays is different training.

1664
01:05:33.76 --> 01:05:35.60
Now we do more nature training.

1665
01:05:35.60 --> 01:05:36.44
Cause just being with-

1666
01:05:36.44 --> 01:05:37.28
I'm doing recovery.

1667
01:05:37.28 --> 01:05:38.20
I'm all about recovery now.

1668
01:05:38.20 --> 01:05:40.80
Yeah. It's good to be outside a lot.

1669
01:05:40.80 --> 01:05:41.64
When you were-

1670
01:05:41.64 --> 01:05:42.96
With surfing, like, you know what I mean?

1671
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:43.80
They taught me how to surf.

1672
01:05:43.80 --> 01:05:44.64
They taught me how to surf.

1673
01:05:44.64 --> 01:05:45.48
They got into surfing.

1674
01:05:45.48 --> 01:05:47.28
The total was taught me how to surf the other day.

1675
01:05:47.28 --> 01:05:48.12
Nice.

1676
01:05:48.12 --> 01:05:48.96
I surf with them.

1677
01:05:48.96 --> 01:05:50.36
They like, they surf a lot.

1678
01:05:52.40 --> 01:05:54.68
When you were training, and like, let's say you were

1679
01:05:54.68 --> 01:05:58.40
getting ready for ADCC or you're getting ready for,

1680
01:05:58.40 --> 01:05:59.52
you know, the worlds.

1681
01:06:01.28 --> 01:06:03.56
How much drilling you doing?

1682
01:06:03.56 --> 01:06:04.48
Nothing changed.

1683
01:06:04.48 --> 01:06:06.56
All's I, I did everything the same.

1684
01:06:06.56 --> 01:06:09.16
I think there was one tournament that I actually had

1685
01:06:09.16 --> 01:06:11.60
like a professional coach.

1686
01:06:11.60 --> 01:06:13.16
But it was just-

1687
01:06:13.16 --> 01:06:14.36
What, like a Jiu-Jitsu coach?

1688
01:06:14.36 --> 01:06:16.48
No, like a fitness nutrition.

1689
01:06:16.48 --> 01:06:19.32
A guy named Chris Eklund in 2011.

1690
01:06:20.40 --> 01:06:22.84
And he had me doing all kinds of shit.

1691
01:06:22.84 --> 01:06:23.84
And how'd you feel?

1692
01:06:23.84 --> 01:06:26.60
I mean, I, that was the best year in my competitive life.

1693
01:06:26.60 --> 01:06:27.64
Yeah.

1694
01:06:27.64 --> 01:06:32.64
So he, you stepped it up and then that made you better.

1695
01:06:32.88 --> 01:06:36.76
He would, he would like frown at me if I was baked.

1696
01:06:38.60 --> 01:06:40.28
You know, he'd be like, yeah.

1697
01:06:40.28 --> 01:06:41.12
I'd be like, for bread.

1698
01:06:41.12 --> 01:06:42.60
You're making me feel bad for all the times

1699
01:06:42.60 --> 01:06:44.20
that I've smiled at you and you were baked.

1700
01:06:44.20 --> 01:06:45.04
Yeah.

1701
01:06:45.04 --> 01:06:47.32
Like, you know, he would be like, what did you eat today?

1702
01:06:47.32 --> 01:06:49.000
And like stuff like that.

1703
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And make sure I did like real like weightlifting stuff.

1704
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
And that year, that was 2011.

1705
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.84
And I had the best results that year.

1706
01:06:55.84 --> 01:06:58.32
Like hands down.

1707
01:06:58.32 --> 01:06:59.16
Did-

1708
01:06:59.16 --> 01:07:00.92
But other than that, I never trained hard.

1709
01:07:00.92 --> 01:07:03.56
I know, I mean, I trained hard, but I didn't work out.

1710
01:07:03.56 --> 01:07:04.60
There was no weights.

1711
01:07:04.60 --> 01:07:06.48
There was no, what do you call it?

1712
01:07:06.48 --> 01:07:07.32
Stadiums.

1713
01:07:07.32 --> 01:07:09.04
There was no stairs.

1714
01:07:09.04 --> 01:07:11.000
There's no elastic bands.

1715
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.48
There was no box jumps.

1716
01:07:12.48 --> 01:07:13.32
Yeah.

1717
01:07:13.32 --> 01:07:14.16
But-

1718
01:07:14.16 --> 01:07:15.000
And there was no bell.

1719
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.64
Those Taco Bell video games.

1720
01:07:16.64 --> 01:07:18.72
And just dope ass jujitsu.

1721
01:07:18.72 --> 01:07:19.56
Yeah, that's the thing.

1722
01:07:19.56 --> 01:07:23.96
And just the best technique, the most like dork about it.

1723
01:07:23.96 --> 01:07:27.56
I would go down the rabbit hole of what's next, what's next.

1724
01:07:27.56 --> 01:07:28.60
Move after that.

1725
01:07:28.60 --> 01:07:30.88
20, 30 move combinations before the dude

1726
01:07:30.88 --> 01:07:32.08
will just give up and I would tap him.

1727
01:07:32.08 --> 01:07:33.68
Glover trains in his sleep.

1728
01:07:33.68 --> 01:07:36.24
I think that's where the magic happens.

1729
01:07:36.24 --> 01:07:37.20
Dean does that too.

1730
01:07:37.20 --> 01:07:38.56
Like, you know, when he would fight

1731
01:07:38.56 --> 01:07:40.64
and we'd all be like, we were all broken everything.

1732
01:07:40.64 --> 01:07:42.56
And so we'd all stay in like one hotel room.

1733
01:07:42.56 --> 01:07:46.16
And like I'd sleep on the floor, but you'd like wake up

1734
01:07:46.16 --> 01:07:48.72
and Dean would be there like asleep,

1735
01:07:48.72 --> 01:07:49.88
but he would be trying.

1736
01:07:49.88 --> 01:07:53.56
He'd be like, not just his legs would be in a triangle

1737
01:07:53.56 --> 01:07:56.12
and like triangle air.

1738
01:07:56.12 --> 01:07:57.96
And then you'd see him like roll over.

1739
01:07:57.96 --> 01:08:01.44
But when he'd roll over, he would like adjust his feet

1740
01:08:01.44 --> 01:08:02.76
and get like a body lock.

1741
01:08:02.76 --> 01:08:04.60
Like shadow wrestling.

1742
01:08:04.60 --> 01:08:05.44
I'm not kidding.

1743
01:08:05.44 --> 01:08:06.36
Like that's where he would sleep.

1744
01:08:06.36 --> 01:08:07.20
Like he would sleep.

1745
01:08:07.20 --> 01:08:08.52
He'd be doing jujitsu when he was sleeping.

1746
01:08:08.52 --> 01:08:10.40
Or like he'd be asleep and his hands

1747
01:08:10.40 --> 01:08:11.84
would be like on a rear naked.

1748
01:08:11.84 --> 01:08:14.04
Like he'd be asleep like one hand under his head,

1749
01:08:14.04 --> 01:08:16.20
but his hands are in a rear naked choke.

1750
01:08:16.20 --> 01:08:20.92
So he's just like dreaming of jujitsu and sleeping that way.

1751
01:08:20.92 --> 01:08:24.32
I met Dean in Brazil when I was out there.

1752
01:08:24.32 --> 01:08:25.64
He'd hang out with my dad and I.

1753
01:08:25.64 --> 01:08:28.76
My dad came and my dad's a big strong guy too.

1754
01:08:28.76 --> 01:08:31.56
Like Dean, like I'm a runt compared to my dad.

1755
01:08:31.56 --> 01:08:33.52
And he just loved me hanging out with Dean.

1756
01:08:33.52 --> 01:08:34.52
He's like, ha ha ha.

1757
01:08:34.52 --> 01:08:36.36
Ha ha ha.

1758
01:08:36.36 --> 01:08:38.52
Your friend is a cool guy.

1759
01:08:38.52 --> 01:08:39.80
Strong guy, Pete.

1760
01:08:39.80 --> 01:08:40.96
You know, he's like looking at me like,

1761
01:08:40.96 --> 01:08:42.24
why can't I be like Dean?

1762
01:08:42.24 --> 01:08:43.88
You know, I'm just like, whoa.

1763
01:08:43.88 --> 01:08:45.48
So like they'd always hang out.

1764
01:08:45.48 --> 01:08:47.32
It was like for like three weeks.

1765
01:08:47.32 --> 01:08:50.52
And Dean showed up to Scotty's house.

1766
01:08:50.52 --> 01:08:51.68
And that's where I met him.

1767
01:08:51.68 --> 01:08:52.80
Because Scotty a little man.

1768
01:08:52.80 --> 01:08:54.68
I lived at Scotty's house on the weekend.

1769
01:08:54.68 --> 01:08:57.68
During the week I lived mostly at Oswaldo Alves,

1770
01:08:57.68 --> 01:09:00.84
which is a little gym where Andre Galvão lived in

1771
01:09:00.84 --> 01:09:02.32
and Jacaré.

1772
01:09:02.32 --> 01:09:03.80
We all lived in there together.

1773
01:09:03.80 --> 01:09:04.96
Andre was a blue belt.

1774
01:09:07.08 --> 01:09:09.56
And at that time, that place,

1775
01:09:09.56 --> 01:09:11.56
they would lock the door on Fridays.

1776
01:09:11.56 --> 01:09:14.72
So if they locked us in, we'd have to stay inside.

1777
01:09:14.72 --> 01:09:16.48
There was no way out.

1778
01:09:16.48 --> 01:09:18.72
It would be like the door to victory locks

1779
01:09:18.72 --> 01:09:21.08
on Friday until Monday.

1780
01:09:21.08 --> 01:09:23.28
So me and Glory, I figure shit out on the weekend

1781
01:09:23.28 --> 01:09:24.40
if we're living in the little,

1782
01:09:24.40 --> 01:09:26.04
it was a little gym, a little bit bigger in here.

1783
01:09:26.04 --> 01:09:29.60
So I would leave and go to Scotty's house in Baja.

1784
01:09:29.60 --> 01:09:30.44
It's like 40 minutes away.

1785
01:09:30.44 --> 01:09:31.32
It was like vacation.

1786
01:09:31.32 --> 01:09:33.24
Scotty had his house set up like a hostel.

1787
01:09:33.24 --> 01:09:34.56
So all these people would come stay.

1788
01:09:34.56 --> 01:09:35.48
They have the mats.

1789
01:09:35.48 --> 01:09:36.76
I think we had the original.

1790
01:09:36.76 --> 01:09:39.68
He had Dean brought the guys from, I think,

1791
01:09:39.68 --> 01:09:42.32
their original friends' years.

1792
01:09:42.32 --> 01:09:45.20
And he brought them and Dean wasn't allowed to train.

1793
01:09:45.20 --> 01:09:46.44
They wouldn't let him train anywhere

1794
01:09:46.44 --> 01:09:48.000
because he went like the year before

1795
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.84
and leg locked everyone.

1796
01:09:49.84 --> 01:09:51.48
So he was banned from every gym

1797
01:09:51.48 --> 01:09:53.76
and he had ADCC coming up.

1798
01:09:53.76 --> 01:09:56.60
And I was kind of in a similar situation.

1799
01:09:56.60 --> 01:09:59.60
So we just, Scotty had a little thing

1800
01:09:59.60 --> 01:10:01.88
right in the living room

1801
01:10:01.88 --> 01:10:04.96
and Dean just trained with me.

1802
01:10:04.96 --> 01:10:07.56
And he went the first day and lost.

1803
01:10:07.56 --> 01:10:09.60
It was Tony D'Souza was also staying over there.

1804
01:10:09.60 --> 01:10:12.44
Tony got disqualified for making the guy too bloody.

1805
01:10:12.44 --> 01:10:15.52
They disqualified him for being too mean to the opponent.

1806
01:10:15.52 --> 01:10:17.28
No one even seen that match.

1807
01:10:17.28 --> 01:10:19.44
But Dean, Dean was kind of bummed out.

1808
01:10:19.44 --> 01:10:22.32
We went and hung out and we hung out with some chicks

1809
01:10:22.32 --> 01:10:23.76
and had fun that night.

1810
01:10:23.76 --> 01:10:26.32
And he's like, I'm gonna do the absolutes.

1811
01:10:26.32 --> 01:10:27.72
And no expectation.

1812
01:10:27.72 --> 01:10:30.72
The winning goes there and just crushes it.

1813
01:10:30.72 --> 01:10:33.60
And then I was like, whoa dude, like this is so cool.

1814
01:10:33.60 --> 01:10:37.44
Like, that's when, yeah, that's when I met Dean.

1815
01:10:37.44 --> 01:10:39.28
He just became ADCC champ.

1816
01:10:39.28 --> 01:10:41.76
He was like, he just turned in like national superstar,

1817
01:10:41.76 --> 01:10:43.68
Brazil, like after that fight.

1818
01:10:43.68 --> 01:10:45.08
And he leg locked everyone.

1819
01:10:45.08 --> 01:10:47.96
And then I kind of felt happy about that.

1820
01:10:47.96 --> 01:10:49.96
I was reading, I couldn't go down.

1821
01:10:49.96 --> 01:10:53.000
I was, I couldn't go down for whatever reason to,

1822
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.92
cause normally I would corner him, right?

1823
01:10:54.92 --> 01:10:56.24
And I couldn't go down.

1824
01:10:56.24 --> 01:11:01.24
And so I'm reading the updates on the interwebs.

1825
01:11:01.24 --> 01:11:02.56
In the guard forums?

1826
01:11:02.56 --> 01:11:03.68
No, it wasn't on in the guard.

1827
01:11:03.68 --> 01:11:05.84
It was on submission grappling.

1828
01:11:05.84 --> 01:11:07.84
I think submission grappling.com.

1829
01:11:07.84 --> 01:11:09.68
And they're putting, but they're,

1830
01:11:09.68 --> 01:11:13.68
it's a translation from Portuguese.

1831
01:11:13.68 --> 01:11:16.12
But it's like some kind of a computer translation

1832
01:11:16.12 --> 01:11:18.32
that someone's translating it and posting it.

1833
01:11:18.32 --> 01:11:20.96
And I remember paid a Pono that in,

1834
01:11:20.96 --> 01:11:23.96
in Portuguese that translates to cloth foot.

1835
01:11:23.96 --> 01:11:27.28
And so it's saying like the American,

1836
01:11:27.28 --> 01:11:30.44
no, cloth foot has the American.

1837
01:11:30.44 --> 01:11:34.000
The American in an arm strangle.

1838
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Then it says, this American has tubes to his lung.

1839
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.24
The cloth foot cannot make him tap.

1840
01:11:40.24 --> 01:11:42.16
It was, and I'm like, oh dude, he's waiting.

1841
01:11:42.16 --> 01:11:44.96
And then it's like, the American got his back.

1842
01:11:44.96 --> 01:11:46.88
I was like, ah, you know, I'm like reading this.

1843
01:11:46.88 --> 01:11:49.20
I was in my car, I was in my freaking minivan.

1844
01:11:49.20 --> 01:11:50.44
Yeah, I was like in my minivan.

1845
01:11:50.44 --> 01:11:53.36
Like, ah, yeah, you know, totally fired up

1846
01:11:53.36 --> 01:11:56.52
that he's doing this and ends up with the.

1847
01:11:56.52 --> 01:11:58.72
Dean's like a national hero anywhere I go.

1848
01:11:58.72 --> 01:12:00.92
Like if we go to Brazil, he's like,

1849
01:12:00.92 --> 01:12:02.04
we hung out in Chicago.

1850
01:12:02.04 --> 01:12:03.28
He was great.

1851
01:12:03.28 --> 01:12:05.40
I just feel like Dean's in there in the bar.

1852
01:12:05.40 --> 01:12:09.28
He's like, how does he arm his friend?

1853
01:12:09.28 --> 01:12:10.72
He's a great person.

1854
01:12:10.72 --> 01:12:13.88
Shoot, he, you guys really helped out Glover and I,

1855
01:12:13.88 --> 01:12:16.48
cause my dad, like I said, he's like a strong alpha dude,

1856
01:12:16.48 --> 01:12:18.92
but I didn't really grow up with him that much.

1857
01:12:18.92 --> 01:12:20.52
I worked with him.

1858
01:12:20.52 --> 01:12:21.80
And I think Glover and the Saint,

1859
01:12:21.80 --> 01:12:23.24
we have strong moms and stuff,

1860
01:12:23.24 --> 01:12:25.68
but like meeting you and seeing how he was doing

1861
01:12:25.68 --> 01:12:28.40
really helps us like, right Glover,

1862
01:12:28.40 --> 01:12:29.60
we got pretty serious.

1863
01:12:29.60 --> 01:12:31.84
Mostly Echo's arms kind of.

1864
01:12:31.84 --> 01:12:32.68
We got serious like,

1865
01:12:32.68 --> 01:12:33.52
It changed my life.

1866
01:12:33.52 --> 01:12:35.88
And we definitely tried to better our lives

1867
01:12:35.88 --> 01:12:36.80
from meeting you.

1868
01:12:36.80 --> 01:12:38.04
Like that's the truth.

1869
01:12:38.04 --> 01:12:39.24
Glover, right?

1870
01:12:39.24 --> 01:12:40.48
I'm joking, of course, you know that.

1871
01:12:40.48 --> 01:12:41.52
You guys know that.

1872
01:12:41.52 --> 01:12:42.36
Yeah.

1873
01:12:42.36 --> 01:12:44.92
Jeff, when you, when you,

1874
01:12:44.92 --> 01:12:47.000
you always give Dean some, some credit

1875
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.36
or a lot of credit actually, when I watched like interviews,

1876
01:12:49.36 --> 01:12:50.88
you'd be talking about Dean and you'll be talking about

1877
01:12:50.88 --> 01:12:53.64
like how he helped out your leg lock game.

1878
01:12:54.64 --> 01:12:56.28
What did that happen when you were teaching here?

1879
01:12:56.28 --> 01:12:58.76
You were already leg locking and heel hooking people, right?

1880
01:12:58.76 --> 01:13:02.12
Yeah, but I mean, Dean motivated all of us.

1881
01:13:02.12 --> 01:13:03.88
And even those who didn't train with him,

1882
01:13:03.88 --> 01:13:05.12
we were all like,

1883
01:13:05.12 --> 01:13:06.20
What is this guy doing?

1884
01:13:06.20 --> 01:13:07.32
Dean, leg locks are bullshit.

1885
01:13:07.32 --> 01:13:11.04
Yeah, but Dean, you know.

1886
01:13:11.04 --> 01:13:12.16
Best comeback ever.

1887
01:13:12.16 --> 01:13:13.000
Yeah, but Dean.

1888
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:13.84
You know what I'm saying?

1889
01:13:13.84 --> 01:13:15.52
And Franjia, that was the one,

1890
01:13:15.52 --> 01:13:17.52
that was when Franjia was like,

1891
01:13:17.52 --> 01:13:20.28
I heard him admit like leg locks worked.

1892
01:13:20.28 --> 01:13:22.60
He was like, look, there's this guy, Jeffy.

1893
01:13:22.60 --> 01:13:25.08
I was like, why is this American guy?

1894
01:13:25.08 --> 01:13:26.36
He's Tapsolo.

1895
01:13:26.36 --> 01:13:27.20
I was like, what?

1896
01:13:27.20 --> 01:13:28.96
He taps all his leg lock, Jeffy.

1897
01:13:28.96 --> 01:13:31.48
You know, he was like,

1898
01:13:31.48 --> 01:13:35.52
I'm sorry, I was like, sad day dog.

1899
01:13:35.52 --> 01:13:36.84
Fuck.

1900
01:13:36.84 --> 01:13:38.56
But you know, it's like,

1901
01:13:38.56 --> 01:13:41.12
that Dean made it okay for us.

1902
01:13:41.12 --> 01:13:42.60
You know, that when an OG would be like,

1903
01:13:42.60 --> 01:13:45.92
no, no, no, no, no, be like, shut up, you grumpy old OG.

1904
01:13:45.92 --> 01:13:47.32
This guy's making them, they're legit.

1905
01:13:47.32 --> 01:13:48.16
So.

1906
01:13:48.16 --> 01:13:49.000
It is true.

1907
01:13:50.20 --> 01:13:53.000
Yeah, that's a, what about the game?

1908
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.44
Like I'll read about your game.

1909
01:13:54.44 --> 01:13:56.08
Like you'll do donkey guard,

1910
01:13:56.08 --> 01:13:58.52
which is for anyone that doesn't do jiu-jitsu,

1911
01:13:58.52 --> 01:13:59.92
it's gonna be kind of hard to explain,

1912
01:13:59.92 --> 01:14:03.000
but just imagine someone that you're gonna fight.

1913
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.68
And what they do is they turn around,

1914
01:14:05.68 --> 01:14:09.12
get on their hands and knees and like jump,

1915
01:14:09.12 --> 01:14:11.72
go attack you with their ass, basically,

1916
01:14:11.72 --> 01:14:14.48
is what it looks like if someone doesn't know.

1917
01:14:14.48 --> 01:14:15.96
That's freaking mayhem, dude.

1918
01:14:15.96 --> 01:14:16.80
Yeah.

1919
01:14:16.80 --> 01:14:19.64
Well, it's based off defense.

1920
01:14:19.64 --> 01:14:21.16
It's based off self-defense.

1921
01:14:21.16 --> 01:14:23.56
I'm a master of people grabbing me.

1922
01:14:23.56 --> 01:14:24.56
So you wrap them to grab me.

1923
01:14:24.56 --> 01:14:25.40
You know what I'm saying?

1924
01:14:25.40 --> 01:14:27.44
I encourage you to grab me in positions

1925
01:14:27.44 --> 01:14:30.12
that they think is good.

1926
01:14:30.12 --> 01:14:32.76
And my self-defense kicks in,

1927
01:14:32.76 --> 01:14:34.08
and it just does what it does.

1928
01:14:34.08 --> 01:14:36.24
And I have a heel hook, you know?

1929
01:14:36.24 --> 01:14:39.80
It's a combination of like the flying leg scissors technique,

1930
01:14:39.80 --> 01:14:44.80
you know, that, and just kind of doing things backwards.

1931
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.96
The level of confidence that you have,

1932
01:14:48.96 --> 01:14:50.64
I might be unmatched.

1933
01:14:50.64 --> 01:14:52.52
I don't know if anyone wants to echo.

1934
01:14:52.52 --> 01:14:53.36
I would agree.

1935
01:14:53.36 --> 01:14:54.20
Unmatched level of confidence?

1936
01:14:54.20 --> 01:14:55.04
Unmatched.

1937
01:14:55.04 --> 01:14:55.88
Unmatched level of confidence.

1938
01:14:55.88 --> 01:14:56.72
Unmatched.

1939
01:14:56.72 --> 01:14:57.56
Like no one's even close.

1940
01:14:57.56 --> 01:14:59.52
I think it's an unmatched level of confidence

1941
01:14:59.52 --> 01:15:04.52
to see you compete and see you just offer positions

1942
01:15:04.84 --> 01:15:08.32
to your opponent that seem insane.

1943
01:15:08.32 --> 01:15:12.52
I would rather look stupid than look scared.

1944
01:15:14.96 --> 01:15:19.40
I don't, I also don't think that there's been a grappler

1945
01:15:19.40 --> 01:15:23.56
that is more, I hate to say this word,

1946
01:15:23.56 --> 01:15:25.84
but like more entertaining to watch.

1947
01:15:25.84 --> 01:15:28.64
Like watch it, like I go watch you,

1948
01:15:28.64 --> 01:15:30.96
I go watch you all day, roll Jiu-Jitsu.

1949
01:15:30.96 --> 01:15:32.08
I go watch you all day.

1950
01:15:32.08 --> 01:15:34.88
Like I told you, I have like videos of you and my son,

1951
01:15:34.88 --> 01:15:37.000
like, like, you know, one, one year,

1952
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.88
one like the next year, like eight minute videos.

1953
01:15:39.88 --> 01:15:41.56
You guys are just rolling.

1954
01:15:41.56 --> 01:15:44.000
And I just, I'll just watch them.

1955
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.20
Cause it's just, even though you're going against a kid,

1956
01:15:47.20 --> 01:15:48.68
I'm like, God, what is he doing?

1957
01:15:48.68 --> 01:15:50.80
I'm like, look at what he's doing right there.

1958
01:15:50.80 --> 01:15:52.92
But then when you watch you compete the same thing,

1959
01:15:52.92 --> 01:15:55.28
it's freaking amazing to watch.

1960
01:15:55.28 --> 01:15:56.12
Yeah, thank you.

1961
01:15:56.12 --> 01:15:57.08
Yeah.

1962
01:15:57.08 --> 01:16:00.32
I've worked very hard to be as good at Jiu-Jitsu as I am.

1963
01:16:00.32 --> 01:16:03.28
That level of confidence though, I'm kind of unmatched.

1964
01:16:04.16 --> 01:16:06.28
I mean, even like you've been teaching a series this week,

1965
01:16:06.28 --> 01:16:09.08
it's like stuff I've never even, well, it's weird

1966
01:16:09.08 --> 01:16:12.32
cause you started teaching this series

1967
01:16:13.20 --> 01:16:16.52
and you know, I watched you here for five years.

1968
01:16:16.52 --> 01:16:18.08
I watched you give your back to people.

1969
01:16:18.08 --> 01:16:19.52
I watched you like do these weird positions.

1970
01:16:19.52 --> 01:16:22.000
I'm like, wow, man, that's just like a Jeff Glover thing.

1971
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.28
And then you were explaining it the other day.

1972
01:16:24.28 --> 01:16:27.28
I was like, oh, this is not just a Jeff Glover thing.

1973
01:16:27.28 --> 01:16:29.000
It's just that Jeff Glover is doing something

1974
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.32
that I didn't understand.

1975
01:16:31.32 --> 01:16:32.16
Yeah.

1976
01:16:32.16 --> 01:16:33.000
Which is-

1977
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.12
I trust my Jiu-Jitsu.

1978
01:16:35.12 --> 01:16:36.48
Don't you trust your Jiu-Jitsu?

1979
01:16:36.48 --> 01:16:38.92
Sometimes not as much as you do bro, at all.

1980
01:16:38.92 --> 01:16:39.96
I trust in it dude.

1981
01:16:39.96 --> 01:16:42.80
My coach used to tell me believe and I believe dude.

1982
01:16:42.80 --> 01:16:43.64
Yeah.

1983
01:16:43.64 --> 01:16:44.48
I believe.

1984
01:16:44.48 --> 01:16:46.56
Jeff doesn't reference other people when he does things.

1985
01:16:46.56 --> 01:16:48.64
He'll just think of it and do it way cooler.

1986
01:16:48.64 --> 01:16:50.52
No, that's like, that's why I say dude,

1987
01:16:50.52 --> 01:16:51.44
I feel like an idiot.

1988
01:16:51.44 --> 01:16:53.20
Like you're like, oh, don't you trust your Jiu-Jitsu?

1989
01:16:53.20 --> 01:16:56.04
I'm like, well not as much as you do bro, apparently.

1990
01:16:56.04 --> 01:16:58.64
Cause you're just in there just not caring what happens

1991
01:16:58.64 --> 01:17:00.12
and still, you know.

1992
01:17:00.12 --> 01:17:01.32
Jeff moves well.

1993
01:17:01.32 --> 01:17:02.64
I'm the worst actually.

1994
01:17:02.64 --> 01:17:04.48
I think I'm the worst.

1995
01:17:04.48 --> 01:17:05.48
People ask me about you.

1996
01:17:05.48 --> 01:17:07.16
Every, everywhere I go do my seminars.

1997
01:17:07.16 --> 01:17:09.68
They're like, what's it like to roll with Jocco?

1998
01:17:09.68 --> 01:17:11.28
And I was telling them like you were always so nice to me.

1999
01:17:11.28 --> 01:17:13.72
You and Dean and Echo, you guys are always, you know,

2000
01:17:13.72 --> 01:17:15.24
so gentle with me.

2001
01:17:15.24 --> 01:17:16.92
I'm so little and like all hard.

2002
01:17:16.92 --> 01:17:18.48
And you guys are like, hi little Jeff.

2003
01:17:18.48 --> 01:17:21.80
And one time you actually like turned it on

2004
01:17:21.80 --> 01:17:23.96
and put me in a Kimura, you know.

2005
01:17:23.96 --> 01:17:25.32
And people love when I tell them that.

2006
01:17:25.32 --> 01:17:26.24
Like there's no point to that

2007
01:17:26.24 --> 01:17:29.64
besides people being like, whoa, you know Jocco?

2008
01:17:29.64 --> 01:17:31.36
Like, yeah, he's really good.

2009
01:17:31.36 --> 01:17:35.92
No, that's, well I was, you know, would feel like

2010
01:17:35.92 --> 01:17:39.16
I wanted to learn how to kind of roll that way

2011
01:17:39.16 --> 01:17:41.52
where you learn more, you know.

2012
01:17:41.52 --> 01:17:42.84
You guys are all nice to me.

2013
01:17:42.84 --> 01:17:45.28
I'm not a good roller and learner.

2014
01:17:45.28 --> 01:17:46.88
You're, that's what you do.

2015
01:17:46.88 --> 01:17:48.96
And I tried to like get that from you

2016
01:17:48.96 --> 01:17:51.000
to be a good roller and learner.

2017
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.56
Which is, it's ridiculous.

2018
01:17:52.56 --> 01:17:53.64
Yeah, yeah.

2019
01:17:53.64 --> 01:17:55.40
It's more fun that way.

2020
01:17:55.40 --> 01:17:57.36
No, I can see that's something that

2021
01:17:57.36 --> 01:17:58.20
lasts longer.

2022
01:17:58.20 --> 01:17:59.44
To this day for sure.

2023
01:17:59.44 --> 01:18:01.12
Yeah, I mean, I got like neck surgery.

2024
01:18:01.12 --> 01:18:01.96
Why'd I get neck surgery?

2025
01:18:01.96 --> 01:18:03.32
If we can Dean Lister trying to choke me

2026
01:18:03.32 --> 01:18:04.24
and I'm not tapping.

2027
01:18:04.24 --> 01:18:06.40
Yeah, I was gonna say Dean wasn't as nice to me

2028
01:18:06.40 --> 01:18:07.24
as you guys were.

2029
01:18:08.48 --> 01:18:12.56
Dean would hold me in like growl in my ear and shit.

2030
01:18:12.56 --> 01:18:13.72
Look at Glover, he can't get up.

2031
01:18:13.72 --> 01:18:15.12
Look at, by the way, everybody.

2032
01:18:15.12 --> 01:18:16.44
Everybody, come here, look at.

2033
01:18:17.76 --> 01:18:19.92
By the way, you ever seen a man get out of this?

2034
01:18:19.92 --> 01:18:21.24
Watch, Glover, try to get out.

2035
01:18:21.24 --> 01:18:23.04
Watch, look, he can't.

2036
01:18:23.04 --> 01:18:24.04
Look how weak he is.

2037
01:18:24.04 --> 01:18:24.88
He can't get out.

2038
01:18:24.88 --> 01:18:28.04
That's like being nice compared to what Dean has done.

2039
01:18:28.04 --> 01:18:30.28
I've seen you, I know.

2040
01:18:30.28 --> 01:18:31.12
I saw that shit.

2041
01:18:31.12 --> 01:18:34.60
It's like a test in humiliation, right?

2042
01:18:34.60 --> 01:18:36.72
Yeah, I gained a lot of respect for you.

2043
01:18:36.72 --> 01:18:38.72
How can I do Jiu-Jitsu?

2044
01:18:38.72 --> 01:18:42.60
I have 225 pounds, I lift weights every day.

2045
01:18:42.60 --> 01:18:44.48
Freaking training Jiu-Jitsu every day.

2046
01:18:44.48 --> 01:18:48.36
And I'm a grown man.

2047
01:18:48.36 --> 01:18:50.88
And Dean would put me in positions

2048
01:18:50.88 --> 01:18:54.32
where I could not move or he could not look,

2049
01:18:54.32 --> 01:18:56.68
could not move my body in any way.

2050
01:18:56.68 --> 01:18:57.52
How's that happening?

2051
01:18:57.52 --> 01:18:58.60
No, I remember you'd say that.

2052
01:18:58.60 --> 01:19:00.44
And he's like holding me with one.

2053
01:19:00.44 --> 01:19:01.36
And he doesn't lift weights.

2054
01:19:01.36 --> 01:19:02.28
No.

2055
01:19:02.28 --> 01:19:03.32
You're like, Dean never lifts weights.

2056
01:19:03.32 --> 01:19:04.60
And he would say stuff like that.

2057
01:19:04.60 --> 01:19:07.80
He'd be like, you need more CrossFit, John Coran.

2058
01:19:07.80 --> 01:19:08.64
Where's your CrossFit?

2059
01:19:08.64 --> 01:19:10.000
I thought you could squat a lot.

2060
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.44
What are you doing?

2061
01:19:11.44 --> 01:19:13.000
How's that squat working out right now?

2062
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.20
That's perfect.

2063
01:19:14.20 --> 01:19:15.44
That's so good.

2064
01:19:15.44 --> 01:19:16.28
We all say that.

2065
01:19:16.28 --> 01:19:17.60
Yeah, he did that shit to me too.

2066
01:19:17.60 --> 01:19:18.92
It's good, but it's not good.

2067
01:19:18.92 --> 01:19:23.000
But so speaking of like the Dean Lister Jocko thing,

2068
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.40
because I will say thankfully,

2069
01:19:25.40 --> 01:19:28.44
I got to be Dean Lister's guy.

2070
01:19:28.44 --> 01:19:31.04
In those years when he was becoming a champion,

2071
01:19:31.04 --> 01:19:34.28
I was the guy, I would train with him every day.

2072
01:19:34.28 --> 01:19:36.80
We train two hours, three hours, four hours a day.

2073
01:19:36.80 --> 01:19:39.48
You need to have someone like that in your life.

2074
01:19:39.48 --> 01:19:41.56
You had Bill the grill.

2075
01:19:41.56 --> 01:19:42.40
Yeah, that's right.

2076
01:19:42.40 --> 01:19:43.64
That's your guy.

2077
01:19:43.64 --> 01:19:45.000
So anybody that's doing Jiu-Jitsu,

2078
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.28
you need to find that guy.

2079
01:19:47.28 --> 01:19:49.84
And the only, we talk about the play for rolling,

2080
01:19:49.84 --> 01:19:52.04
and look, I just talked about Dean.

2081
01:19:52.04 --> 01:19:54.88
Like humiliate, and believe me, he'd humiliate me.

2082
01:19:54.88 --> 01:19:57.48
Any day I'd get a position on him,

2083
01:19:57.48 --> 01:20:01.28
bro, I would go twice as hard humiliating him

2084
01:20:01.28 --> 01:20:02.68
and having fun with it.

2085
01:20:02.68 --> 01:20:04.16
Payback's a bitch though.

2086
01:20:04.16 --> 01:20:07.76
But for Jiu-Jitsu, you got to find somebody,

2087
01:20:07.76 --> 01:20:09.92
or like, it's probably going to be one person.

2088
01:20:09.92 --> 01:20:12.80
It's hard to even find more than one person like this.

2089
01:20:12.80 --> 01:20:17.80
But someone that's going to be your like true brother,

2090
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.76
teammate that you're going to roll with,

2091
01:20:19.76 --> 01:20:21.12
you're going to learn with, you're going to work on stuff,

2092
01:20:21.12 --> 01:20:22.88
you're going to stay after, you're going to drill stuff,

2093
01:20:22.88 --> 01:20:24.08
you're going to get tapped out by each other,

2094
01:20:24.08 --> 01:20:25.16
you don't care.

2095
01:20:25.16 --> 01:20:26.28
It's just like that.

2096
01:20:26.28 --> 01:20:27.60
You had Bill the grill.

2097
01:20:27.60 --> 01:20:29.40
How'd he come into the scene?

2098
01:20:29.40 --> 01:20:31.20
Well, he just, he did, you know?

2099
01:20:31.20 --> 01:20:32.80
He just started showing up.

2100
01:20:32.80 --> 01:20:34.16
How far behind he?

2101
01:20:34.16 --> 01:20:35.32
He's five years younger.

2102
01:20:35.32 --> 01:20:36.76
He was 13.

2103
01:20:36.76 --> 01:20:37.96
He was 13 when he started,

2104
01:20:37.96 --> 01:20:39.44
but we had him in the adult class.

2105
01:20:39.44 --> 01:20:40.56
By the time he was 15,

2106
01:20:40.56 --> 01:20:43.04
he was the Purple Belt National Champion,

2107
01:20:43.04 --> 01:20:44.12
breaking off adults.

2108
01:20:44.12 --> 01:20:44.96
Him and Chrome Grace,

2109
01:20:44.96 --> 01:20:47.04
he made it to the finals of a tournament.

2110
01:20:47.04 --> 01:20:49.000
They were both 15 years old.

2111
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.32
Tapped eight dudes in the way to meet each other

2112
01:20:51.32 --> 01:20:52.92
in the finals.

2113
01:20:52.92 --> 01:20:54.48
And it was like, you know,

2114
01:20:54.48 --> 01:20:56.40
like dude, kids can be really tough.

2115
01:20:56.40 --> 01:20:59.24
Oh dude, I had that conversation with Lovato,

2116
01:20:59.24 --> 01:21:02.04
Junior, we were at ADCC.

2117
01:21:02.04 --> 01:21:04.28
Cause he was like 17.

2118
01:21:04.28 --> 01:21:06.16
He was actually, I know he was 17.

2119
01:21:06.16 --> 01:21:07.08
I don't know how old I was,

2120
01:21:07.08 --> 01:21:08.48
but I was like 20.

2121
01:21:08.48 --> 01:21:10.20
I was maybe even, I was a grown,

2122
01:21:10.20 --> 01:21:11.92
definitely a grown man.

2123
01:21:11.92 --> 01:21:13.64
And I was like, dude, you beat me.

2124
01:21:13.64 --> 01:21:15.96
He goes, I said, dude, you beat me.

2125
01:21:15.96 --> 01:21:17.88
I said, we were Purple Bucks, you beat me.

2126
01:21:17.88 --> 01:21:19.68
And he goes, I beat you twice.

2127
01:21:19.68 --> 01:21:22.08
Oh, he beat me in the weight class

2128
01:21:22.08 --> 01:21:24.16
and he beat me in the absolute, bro.

2129
01:21:24.16 --> 01:21:26.92
And I was like, hell yeah, that's a 17 year old.

2130
01:21:26.92 --> 01:21:28.68
I don't remember how he beat me in open,

2131
01:21:28.68 --> 01:21:29.60
but he swept me.

2132
01:21:29.60 --> 01:21:31.56
Like, you know, sometimes you get swept

2133
01:21:31.56 --> 01:21:32.40
and you're just like, man,

2134
01:21:32.40 --> 01:21:34.24
I hope no one got that on video

2135
01:21:34.24 --> 01:21:35.28
cause you feel real ignorant.

2136
01:21:35.28 --> 01:21:36.60
You like landed on it.

2137
01:21:36.60 --> 01:21:38.20
Yeah, he just did like one of those sweeps to me

2138
01:21:38.20 --> 01:21:39.96
that I was all just dumb.

2139
01:21:39.96 --> 01:21:42.20
And, you know, it was just awesome.

2140
01:21:42.20 --> 01:21:45.28
But yeah, a guy that's young, you know,

2141
01:21:45.28 --> 01:21:47.56
I don't care, like a 17 year old can work out a lot,

2142
01:21:47.56 --> 01:21:48.60
but he's not gonna be,

2143
01:21:48.60 --> 01:21:50.88
he's not gonna have man strength yet, you know?

2144
01:21:50.88 --> 01:21:54.60
And that was bad ass Lovato just retired.

2145
01:21:54.60 --> 01:21:59.000
But man, we made it two rounds at ADCC

2146
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.44
against the best in the world.

2147
01:22:00.44 --> 01:22:02.40
It's hard for me to talk about Lovato.

2148
01:22:02.40 --> 01:22:03.24
He's a good dude.

2149
01:22:03.24 --> 01:22:04.08
He's just.

2150
01:22:04.08 --> 01:22:05.56
He just came to my gym.

2151
01:22:05.56 --> 01:22:06.68
It's just so much to say.

2152
01:22:06.68 --> 01:22:08.16
We met him from Scotty too.

2153
01:22:08.16 --> 01:22:09.000
Yeah, yeah.

2154
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:09.84
Good friend of mine.

2155
01:22:09.84 --> 01:22:10.68
There's another one, OTM.

2156
01:22:10.68 --> 01:22:12.04
I would see him at every tournament.

2157
01:22:12.04 --> 01:22:13.04
Yeah, we were bros.

2158
01:22:15.16 --> 01:22:16.96
Those got, well him, you,

2159
01:22:16.96 --> 01:22:18.20
you guys were just competitors.

2160
01:22:18.20 --> 01:22:20.88
He would go train with Lehman a lot.

2161
01:22:20.88 --> 01:22:22.72
A lot of people would make their way to Vegas

2162
01:22:22.72 --> 01:22:23.68
to spend time with Lehman.

2163
01:22:23.68 --> 01:22:24.84
And I would run into them there

2164
01:22:24.84 --> 01:22:27.28
cause Lehman hired me as his Jiu-Jitsu teacher

2165
01:22:27.28 --> 01:22:29.24
for two and a half years.

2166
01:22:29.24 --> 01:22:30.80
How many classes a day were you teaching there?

2167
01:22:30.80 --> 01:22:32.80
Like, you know, a full ton thing.

2168
01:22:32.80 --> 01:22:34.72
Like I was doing here like four a day.

2169
01:22:35.88 --> 01:22:37.80
I almost had that job too.

2170
01:22:37.80 --> 01:22:38.64
It was a good job.

2171
01:22:38.64 --> 01:22:39.48
Which one, Lehman job?

2172
01:22:39.48 --> 01:22:42.40
Lehman job, but I went to Hilo instead.

2173
01:22:42.40 --> 01:22:43.88
Cause what I used to do is this.

2174
01:22:43.88 --> 01:22:47.80
I used to stay in Vegas Monday through Thursday

2175
01:22:47.80 --> 01:22:51.20
and then drive over to Los Angeles

2176
01:22:51.20 --> 01:22:53.32
just after I got back from Brazil.

2177
01:22:53.32 --> 01:22:54.44
I would drive over to Los Angeles

2178
01:22:54.44 --> 01:22:55.76
and train at Eddie Bravo's school.

2179
01:22:55.76 --> 01:22:57.08
And that's how I met them.

2180
01:22:57.08 --> 01:23:01.12
Joe Rogan, Eddie Bravo, Tate Fletcher.

2181
01:23:01.12 --> 01:23:02.32
It was in the bomb squad.

2182
01:23:02.32 --> 01:23:05.48
I had my friend Rob Kamen.

2183
01:23:05.48 --> 01:23:07.68
He's the Dutch kickboxer and they're over there.

2184
01:23:07.68 --> 01:23:10.92
And so, cause in Vegas, the hotel's like 40 bucks a night.

2185
01:23:10.92 --> 01:23:13.72
I'd stay in Harrah's and the weekend like 300.

2186
01:23:13.72 --> 01:23:16.04
I'm like, oh, I'm going to LA.

2187
01:23:16.04 --> 01:23:19.28
I would say it's Scotty's brother's house, sometimes Cade,

2188
01:23:19.28 --> 01:23:20.92
which was.

2189
01:23:20.92 --> 01:23:22.36
I also used to live there.

2190
01:23:22.36 --> 01:23:24.16
So when Scotty left Brazil,

2191
01:23:24.16 --> 01:23:26.12
he became like the Los Angeles guy.

2192
01:23:26.12 --> 01:23:29.16
So anytime we go to LA, we hit up Scotty.

2193
01:23:29.16 --> 01:23:33.60
And Scotty knew everyone and everything and shoot

2194
01:23:33.60 --> 01:23:35.96
and Glover, that's when I got hurt.

2195
01:23:35.96 --> 01:23:38.20
You know, I was, I wanted to be an MMA fighter.

2196
01:23:38.20 --> 01:23:40.16
So I was more interested in like, I'm like, you know,

2197
01:23:40.16 --> 01:23:41.24
I'll put the metal aside.

2198
01:23:41.24 --> 01:23:42.08
What was your weight?

2199
01:23:42.08 --> 01:23:44.92
BJ Penn, I was a lightweight, light and middle.

2200
01:23:44.92 --> 01:23:49.92
When did you guys see the no G versus the G?

2201
01:23:50.08 --> 01:23:52.76
Like at what point did you see that as sort of

2202
01:23:52.76 --> 01:23:54.44
what you were going to do?

2203
01:23:54.44 --> 01:23:57.64
80 CC, that would be like when,

2204
01:23:57.64 --> 01:24:00.76
well, if my coach Carlson, he didn't like the G.

2205
01:24:00.76 --> 01:24:03.76
Like, Elio Gracie put him to fight his first MMA fight

2206
01:24:03.76 --> 01:24:05.52
with the G and he told, I'll never do that again.

2207
01:24:05.52 --> 01:24:07.08
You're crazy.

2208
01:24:07.08 --> 01:24:07.92
You know what I mean?

2209
01:24:07.92 --> 01:24:11.12
He took that down and that was that.

2210
01:24:11.12 --> 01:24:12.08
And then that Carlson,

2211
01:24:12.08 --> 01:24:15.52
he never really used the G to use it for the kids.

2212
01:24:15.52 --> 01:24:17.28
They use it to warm up.

2213
01:24:17.28 --> 01:24:19.56
But the best guy is like Carlson would just grab something

2214
01:24:19.56 --> 01:24:21.60
by the neck like this.

2215
01:24:21.60 --> 01:24:22.80
It doesn't mean if they were a kid or not.

2216
01:24:22.80 --> 01:24:24.12
And if they'd flinch like these,

2217
01:24:24.12 --> 01:24:25.88
they'd be like, no, no, you're just jujitsu.

2218
01:24:25.88 --> 01:24:27.60
And if you go like this and the kid,

2219
01:24:27.60 --> 01:24:29.12
he's like, okay, you're fighting.

2220
01:24:29.12 --> 01:24:29.96
He's a man.

2221
01:24:29.96 --> 01:24:32.48
Even if they're adults, he's already old,

2222
01:24:32.48 --> 01:24:33.76
but he's like this.

2223
01:24:33.76 --> 01:24:35.48
And the kid's like,

2224
01:24:35.48 --> 01:24:36.92
like a man who grabbed Nick Diaz like that,

2225
01:24:36.92 --> 01:24:38.24
he's going to be happy.

2226
01:24:38.24 --> 01:24:39.08
Yeah.

2227
01:24:39.08 --> 01:24:40.20
Oh, you're about to fight.

2228
01:24:40.20 --> 01:24:41.32
You go here.

2229
01:24:41.32 --> 01:24:44.08
And so that's how our team was.

2230
01:24:44.08 --> 01:24:46.56
And Carlson, he was nicer to the bigger guys.

2231
01:24:46.56 --> 01:24:48.76
So I feel like a Rona size can be real nice to you.

2232
01:24:48.76 --> 01:24:51.08
If you're like my size, it's kind of like,

2233
01:24:51.08 --> 01:24:52.84
you know what, Pete?

2234
01:24:52.84 --> 01:24:54.20
Jeff gets the same way you do.

2235
01:24:54.20 --> 01:24:55.88
And Jeff gets around to big, big guys.

2236
01:24:55.88 --> 01:24:57.92
He gets mean to me a little bit.

2237
01:24:57.92 --> 01:24:59.36
Carlson the same way.

2238
01:25:00.88 --> 01:25:03.36
No, but I'm just saying like big people,

2239
01:25:03.36 --> 01:25:05.24
they give a good presentation as far.

2240
01:25:05.24 --> 01:25:06.84
Like Dean, he's an example.

2241
01:25:06.84 --> 01:25:07.68
You-

2242
01:25:07.68 --> 01:25:10.24
I respect bigger, I respect size.

2243
01:25:10.24 --> 01:25:11.16
I'm a little dude.

2244
01:25:11.16 --> 01:25:12.96
Big dude scare me.

2245
01:25:12.96 --> 01:25:13.80
He likes it.

2246
01:25:13.80 --> 01:25:14.84
Whether they know jujitsu or not.

2247
01:25:14.84 --> 01:25:16.40
Glover always has big friends, dude.

2248
01:25:16.40 --> 01:25:18.000
Some strong, tough guys, dude.

2249
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.48
I come around like fuck.

2250
01:25:19.48 --> 01:25:21.20
The weird thing about Dean is he's a mutant

2251
01:25:21.20 --> 01:25:23.32
because he's still so flexible.

2252
01:25:23.32 --> 01:25:24.16
He is.

2253
01:25:24.16 --> 01:25:25.000
It's crazy.

2254
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:25.84
It's a weird flexibility.

2255
01:25:25.84 --> 01:25:26.68
Dean's special.

2256
01:25:26.68 --> 01:25:28.80
He's like the Ritolo brothers, like Glover, like BJ Penn.

2257
01:25:28.80 --> 01:25:31.08
He's all special, like, what do you think?

2258
01:25:31.08 --> 01:25:32.20
Glover, special people, right?

2259
01:25:32.20 --> 01:25:33.20
We're all pretty special.

2260
01:25:33.20 --> 01:25:34.72
Jocko, like dude.

2261
01:25:34.72 --> 01:25:37.16
Jujitsu people are some of the coolest people

2262
01:25:37.16 --> 01:25:38.76
in the world today.

2263
01:25:38.76 --> 01:25:41.28
We have the DNA, like it has to be in our DNA

2264
01:25:41.28 --> 01:25:45.000
to be a superhero, at least know something of jujitsu.

2265
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.32
Yeah, well, there's definitely a threat of like,

2266
01:25:48.32 --> 01:25:52.08
it's, you know, they say martial arts, right?

2267
01:25:52.08 --> 01:25:54.52
Like it's an art form.

2268
01:25:54.52 --> 01:25:56.56
And then you think it's stereotypical artist.

2269
01:25:56.56 --> 01:25:59.16
You think like somebody, a rock and roll artist,

2270
01:25:59.16 --> 01:26:00.96
like he's a little bit crazy.

2271
01:26:00.96 --> 01:26:02.92
Like a painter is a little bit crazy.

2272
01:26:02.92 --> 01:26:05.000
A poet's a little bit crazy.

2273
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.12
Let's face it, the jujitsu player, if he's gonna be good,

2274
01:26:08.12 --> 01:26:09.88
he's gonna be a little bit,

2275
01:26:09.88 --> 01:26:11.28
he's gonna have a little bit,

2276
01:26:11.28 --> 01:26:13.16
there's a decent chance I should say,

2277
01:26:13.16 --> 01:26:14.84
he's a little bit crazy.

2278
01:26:14.84 --> 01:26:16.40
Especially like a deep half garter

2279
01:26:16.40 --> 01:26:18.12
to go under someone like that.

2280
01:26:18.12 --> 01:26:18.96
Yeah.

2281
01:26:18.96 --> 01:26:19.78
We have to be.

2282
01:26:19.78 --> 01:26:22.76
But you gotta be, you know, when you talk to Dean,

2283
01:26:22.76 --> 01:26:24.56
you start talking to him about jujitsu,

2284
01:26:24.56 --> 01:26:26.20
he knows weird things about jujitsu.

2285
01:26:26.20 --> 01:26:28.12
It's like you were saying about Glover the other day.

2286
01:26:28.12 --> 01:26:29.60
Like you asked Glover some questions,

2287
01:26:29.60 --> 01:26:32.000
some detailed question about some weird section of jujitsu

2288
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.40
and all of a sudden he's talking about something

2289
01:26:33.40 --> 01:26:34.84
and you're like, how do you know that?

2290
01:26:34.84 --> 01:26:36.60
How's it possible that you know that?

2291
01:26:36.60 --> 01:26:38.40
That's the way Dean is.

2292
01:26:38.40 --> 01:26:40.40
Have you ever asked Dean like,

2293
01:26:40.40 --> 01:26:41.44
if you say Dean like,

2294
01:26:41.44 --> 01:26:44.84
hey Dean, I'm having trouble with this triangle.

2295
01:26:44.84 --> 01:26:46.28
And he'll say what kind of triangle?

2296
01:26:46.28 --> 01:26:47.32
And you say, what do you mean?

2297
01:26:47.32 --> 01:26:50.40
And he'll say, well, there's nine types of triangles.

2298
01:26:50.40 --> 01:26:52.48
And then he'll tell you what they all are

2299
01:26:52.48 --> 01:26:54.40
and tell you all the specifics about it.

2300
01:26:54.40 --> 01:26:55.24
And the history.

2301
01:26:55.24 --> 01:26:56.08
Dean needs a book like that.

2302
01:26:56.08 --> 01:26:58.36
I think like he has some pretty cool stories.

2303
01:26:58.36 --> 01:27:00.04
Bro, let me tell you a story about Dean.

2304
01:27:00.04 --> 01:27:04.64
We were at an event and we were doing some jujitsu,

2305
01:27:04.64 --> 01:27:07.36
like presenting basic jujitsu kind of self defense

2306
01:27:07.36 --> 01:27:09.44
to a few hundred people.

2307
01:27:09.44 --> 01:27:10.32
Yeah.

2308
01:27:10.32 --> 01:27:15.32
And he's showing a way to escape someone's like bear hug,

2309
01:27:16.28 --> 01:27:17.12
right?

2310
01:27:17.12 --> 01:27:19.04
Basic jujitsu or basic self defense.

2311
01:27:19.04 --> 01:27:20.56
So you grab a bear hug and he's showing,

2312
01:27:20.56 --> 01:27:22.40
oh, you put the one hand in front of the face

2313
01:27:22.40 --> 01:27:24.32
and you put the other hand underneath that one

2314
01:27:24.32 --> 01:27:26.56
and you can make space and you push the person away.

2315
01:27:26.56 --> 01:27:28.84
And so he shows it a couple of times,

2316
01:27:28.84 --> 01:27:30.40
this hand goes here, this hand goes here,

2317
01:27:30.40 --> 01:27:32.64
you push him away, make space, boom.

2318
01:27:32.64 --> 01:27:34.84
And he goes, any questions?

2319
01:27:34.84 --> 01:27:36.96
And a guy in the audience says,

2320
01:27:36.96 --> 01:27:38.64
hey, I have a question.

2321
01:27:38.64 --> 01:27:40.04
Dean says, yeah, what's the question?

2322
01:27:40.04 --> 01:27:41.96
The guy says, I only have one hand.

2323
01:27:41.96 --> 01:27:44.92
And he holds up like he's only got one hand.

2324
01:27:44.92 --> 01:27:46.12
What should I do?

2325
01:27:46.12 --> 01:27:47.64
And Dean without missing a beat,

2326
01:27:47.64 --> 01:27:49.12
like just instantaneously goes,

2327
01:27:49.12 --> 01:27:50.76
oh, if you only have one hand,

2328
01:27:50.76 --> 01:27:52.52
you put this hand here, you use your shoulder.

2329
01:27:52.52 --> 01:27:56.60
He's like had the ultimate solution for a person

2330
01:27:56.60 --> 01:28:00.96
that only has one hand that's doing jujitsu self defense.

2331
01:28:00.96 --> 01:28:05.24
Like that's some next level knowledge.

2332
01:28:05.24 --> 01:28:06.08
You know what I'm saying?

2333
01:28:06.08 --> 01:28:08.68
He can improvise because of the amount of knowledge

2334
01:28:08.68 --> 01:28:11.000
he has when he improvises, it's not bullshit.

2335
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.04
Yeah, that's the weird thing.

2336
01:28:12.04 --> 01:28:14.12
It didn't even, he answered it so quickly.

2337
01:28:14.12 --> 01:28:16.04
He didn't even need to, you know,

2338
01:28:16.04 --> 01:28:17.60
I would need to be like, well, come on out here.

2339
01:28:17.60 --> 01:28:18.44
Let's look at it.

2340
01:28:18.44 --> 01:28:20.08
Let me look, let's go through it.

2341
01:28:20.08 --> 01:28:21.88
Dean like knew what to say.

2342
01:28:21.88 --> 01:28:22.84
No, he's good.

2343
01:28:22.84 --> 01:28:25.28
He doesn't know how to not say anything else.

2344
01:28:26.48 --> 01:28:27.68
It was freaking crazy.

2345
01:28:28.72 --> 01:28:31.64
Jeff, what injuries have you gotten from jujitsu?

2346
01:28:33.36 --> 01:28:34.92
All of them, you know.

2347
01:28:34.92 --> 01:28:36.000
What's the worst ones?

2348
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.48
I mean, I had a back surgery,

2349
01:28:38.48 --> 01:28:40.92
but I can't even say that that happened from jujitsu.

2350
01:28:40.92 --> 01:28:43.40
The injury itself, I don't know where that happened.

2351
01:28:43.40 --> 01:28:45.16
I don't know how that happened,

2352
01:28:45.16 --> 01:28:46.68
but I had like, what'd you have,

2353
01:28:46.68 --> 01:28:49.16
my good discrepancies, what I had, you know.

2354
01:28:49.16 --> 01:28:50.32
So they pulled some discs out,

2355
01:28:50.32 --> 01:28:51.64
wearing your back, lower back.

2356
01:28:51.64 --> 01:28:52.84
Yeah, my lower back.

2357
01:28:52.84 --> 01:28:55.84
And that was the most miserable,

2358
01:28:55.84 --> 01:28:58.36
long chronic pain I've ever had.

2359
01:28:58.36 --> 01:29:01.24
And was it like the pain that people get down their legs?

2360
01:29:01.24 --> 01:29:02.08
Yeah, pretty typical.

2361
01:29:02.08 --> 01:29:03.56
Jeff was crawling around his house.

2362
01:29:03.56 --> 01:29:04.40
No, I was crawling.

2363
01:29:04.40 --> 01:29:07.56
It was to the point where I was, I would wake up,

2364
01:29:07.56 --> 01:29:12.20
cry for like an hour, you know, crawl into the shower,

2365
01:29:12.20 --> 01:29:13.56
and then crawl back to bed,

2366
01:29:13.56 --> 01:29:15.08
call one of my friends to come feed me.

2367
01:29:15.08 --> 01:29:16.80
I mean, it was just horrible, you know.

2368
01:29:16.80 --> 01:29:19.32
That must be you texted me one time.

2369
01:29:19.32 --> 01:29:20.36
Remember dude, I was like,

2370
01:29:20.36 --> 01:29:21.64
Choco, help me.

2371
01:29:21.64 --> 01:29:23.96
Somebody help me do my back hurts, I don't know how to.

2372
01:29:23.96 --> 01:29:26.68
I know when Jeff Glover texted me.

2373
01:29:26.68 --> 01:29:28.32
I know shit's getting serious.

2374
01:29:28.32 --> 01:29:30.16
It's probably like somebody help me.

2375
01:29:31.36 --> 01:29:32.20
It was bad, dude.

2376
01:29:32.20 --> 01:29:33.80
I was eating advils and shit,

2377
01:29:33.80 --> 01:29:35.96
cause I don't want to take like, I don't know.

2378
01:29:35.96 --> 01:29:37.24
I don't want to take like pills.

2379
01:29:37.24 --> 01:29:38.08
Yeah.

2380
01:29:38.08 --> 01:29:39.44
I was like, I'll take the Tylenols or whatever.

2381
01:29:39.44 --> 01:29:41.16
How long ago did you get that back surgery?

2382
01:29:41.16 --> 01:29:42.40
That was in April.

2383
01:29:42.40 --> 01:29:43.96
And how's the recovery?

2384
01:29:43.96 --> 01:29:44.80
It's good.

2385
01:29:44.80 --> 01:29:45.32
I'm back to, I mean, I mean,

2386
01:29:45.32 --> 01:29:47.36
Choco, I wasn't even teaching classes.

2387
01:29:47.36 --> 01:29:48.64
I couldn't, you know, I couldn't do anything.

2388
01:29:48.64 --> 01:29:53.64
Like I'm back to, like I didn't want to be able to roll again

2389
01:29:54.20 --> 01:29:55.72
and I'm rolling again.

2390
01:29:55.72 --> 01:29:57.64
I was like, I was like, listen doc,

2391
01:29:57.64 --> 01:29:59.48
I'm not trying to get you to fix me to the point

2392
01:29:59.48 --> 01:30:00.72
where I win world titles, doc.

2393
01:30:00.72 --> 01:30:03.04
I just want to be able to like be on the mat

2394
01:30:03.04 --> 01:30:06.36
and show a move to somebody without crying, you know.

2395
01:30:06.36 --> 01:30:07.92
And now I'm at the point where I'm like,

2396
01:30:07.92 --> 01:30:09.56
shit dude, should I take matches?

2397
01:30:09.56 --> 01:30:12.80
Like nothing hurts anymore, man.

2398
01:30:12.80 --> 01:30:14.60
My surgeon is a jujitsu guy.

2399
01:30:14.60 --> 01:30:17.36
He's one of Frenzy's students.

2400
01:30:17.36 --> 01:30:18.20
And you know.

2401
01:30:18.20 --> 01:30:19.64
And would he do a discotomy?

2402
01:30:19.64 --> 01:30:20.76
Micro discotomy.

2403
01:30:20.76 --> 01:30:22.32
So he pulls some little disc out,

2404
01:30:22.32 --> 01:30:23.16
get it away from your nerves.

2405
01:30:23.16 --> 01:30:25.16
Yeah, rupture disc, yeah, something like that.

2406
01:30:25.16 --> 01:30:26.40
Jeff took pictures of it.

2407
01:30:26.40 --> 01:30:27.40
Yeah, no, they recorded it.

2408
01:30:27.40 --> 01:30:28.72
They took a whole, they recorded it.

2409
01:30:28.72 --> 01:30:31.64
He showed like a little, looks like a little teeth.

2410
01:30:31.64 --> 01:30:34.12
The doctor was just so kind to me, man.

2411
01:30:34.12 --> 01:30:36.44
He, you know, he was like, you know,

2412
01:30:36.44 --> 01:30:38.40
see you tomorrow at six a.m. for surgery.

2413
01:30:38.40 --> 01:30:39.56
He's like, what?

2414
01:30:39.56 --> 01:30:40.76
Doesn't take a week or nothing?

2415
01:30:40.76 --> 01:30:41.92
He's like, no, tomorrow.

2416
01:30:41.92 --> 01:30:43.12
See you there, got it.

2417
01:30:43.12 --> 01:30:44.52
And just got it done.

2418
01:30:44.52 --> 01:30:47.12
And how long did it, did the relief was like instant?

2419
01:30:47.12 --> 01:30:49.52
As soon as I woke up from anesthesia,

2420
01:30:49.52 --> 01:30:51.36
I was like so happy.

2421
01:30:51.36 --> 01:30:54.32
Were you scared about getting back surgery?

2422
01:30:54.32 --> 01:30:55.16
Not at all.

2423
01:30:55.16 --> 01:30:56.68
You were just like, hey, I've had enough?

2424
01:30:56.68 --> 01:30:57.56
That was done.

2425
01:30:57.56 --> 01:31:00.28
Cause I know a lot of people, you know,

2426
01:31:00.28 --> 01:31:01.80
they go through that time period with like,

2427
01:31:01.80 --> 01:31:04.56
I don't want to get surgery, which I get.

2428
01:31:04.56 --> 01:31:06.000
Because, oh yeah, well I did that.

2429
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.08
I went through that like,

2430
01:31:07.08 --> 01:31:10.12
oh, I'm going to foundational training it away.

2431
01:31:10.12 --> 01:31:12.24
There's like a stance that I'm going to hold for three minutes.

2432
01:31:12.24 --> 01:31:13.76
And it's like, no, no, that shit was working.

2433
01:31:13.76 --> 01:31:14.60
Yeah.

2434
01:31:14.60 --> 01:31:16.28
So you tried all that stuff and it's not working.

2435
01:31:16.28 --> 01:31:17.84
And eventually the pain gets to a point.

2436
01:31:17.84 --> 01:31:19.88
I know people that have had surgeries

2437
01:31:19.88 --> 01:31:22.56
and they haven't gone great and it sucks.

2438
01:31:22.56 --> 01:31:24.08
So I generally tell people like,

2439
01:31:24.08 --> 01:31:26.32
hey, if you can put it off, put it off.

2440
01:31:26.32 --> 01:31:27.80
And then at a certain point you got to go,

2441
01:31:27.80 --> 01:31:30.04
okay, look, I tried and this isn't working.

2442
01:31:30.04 --> 01:31:32.32
And I know a lot of people that have gone just like you.

2443
01:31:32.32 --> 01:31:35.68
They went and got surgery and they wake up and they're like,

2444
01:31:35.68 --> 01:31:37.36
oh, I'm healed.

2445
01:31:37.36 --> 01:31:40.000
I mean, imagine that go from debilitating pain,

2446
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.48
which is what you had, you wake up and you're healed.

2447
01:31:42.48 --> 01:31:43.68
I did that.

2448
01:31:43.68 --> 01:31:44.88
What surgery was that?

2449
01:31:44.88 --> 01:31:46.40
Well, I had five.

2450
01:31:46.40 --> 01:31:47.24
Yes.

2451
01:31:47.24 --> 01:31:50.92
So the first one, the first one was in Hawaii,

2452
01:31:50.92 --> 01:31:52.28
they cleaned it out, that was fixed.

2453
01:31:52.28 --> 01:31:57.28
And then later on, like I had the Glover one in my lower back

2454
01:31:57.28 --> 01:31:58.20
but it went bad.

2455
01:31:58.20 --> 01:32:01.20
Sometimes with those things, like when you get it cut,

2456
01:32:01.20 --> 01:32:03.04
the disc, the disc comes back.

2457
01:32:03.04 --> 01:32:05.84
Your Pete's scar, your scar is so big.

2458
01:32:05.84 --> 01:32:07.56
Like my scar that I have from the thing,

2459
01:32:07.56 --> 01:32:08.40
you can't even see it.

2460
01:32:08.40 --> 01:32:12.24
But when I had my car accident with the drunk drivers,

2461
01:32:12.24 --> 01:32:15.84
I also, it made my neck numb again, my arm and my leg.

2462
01:32:15.84 --> 01:32:16.68
So I had both.

2463
01:32:16.68 --> 01:32:17.72
I was like, whoa.

2464
01:32:17.72 --> 01:32:18.56
There's a good thing, right?

2465
01:32:18.56 --> 01:32:19.40
There is.

2466
01:32:19.40 --> 01:32:20.84
No, there's these ones.

2467
01:32:20.84 --> 01:32:21.68
There's a little here too.

2468
01:32:21.68 --> 01:32:22.92
I don't know, there's some.

2469
01:32:22.92 --> 01:32:24.32
I don't know.

2470
01:32:24.32 --> 01:32:26.76
But I have artificial discs in there.

2471
01:32:26.76 --> 01:32:27.60
And how those work?

2472
01:32:27.60 --> 01:32:29.000
So when they put that in there,

2473
01:32:29.96 --> 01:32:31.48
it took away that numbness.

2474
01:32:31.48 --> 01:32:33.72
I was just like, oh.

2475
01:32:33.72 --> 01:32:35.24
But it still gets sore.

2476
01:32:35.24 --> 01:32:37.000
Of course, it's not perfect.

2477
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.76
But it took away that.

2478
01:32:38.76 --> 01:32:40.24
You're just like, oh.

2479
01:32:40.24 --> 01:32:42.08
And I thought I was getting a dyssectomy in there,

2480
01:32:42.08 --> 01:32:43.44
whatever they call it.

2481
01:32:43.44 --> 01:32:46.36
I went into surgery thinking they were gonna clean it out.

2482
01:32:46.36 --> 01:32:48.04
And I'm reading on a thing that says,

2483
01:32:48.04 --> 01:32:49.40
disc replacements too.

2484
01:32:49.40 --> 01:32:50.52
I'm like, oh, shit.

2485
01:32:50.52 --> 01:32:51.36
I'm like.

2486
01:32:51.36 --> 01:32:53.68
Disreplacements are only like 10 years old,

2487
01:32:53.68 --> 01:32:55.04
12 years old in the neck.

2488
01:32:55.04 --> 01:32:55.88
Yeah.

2489
01:32:55.88 --> 01:32:57.12
And so it's awesome, right?

2490
01:32:57.12 --> 01:32:57.96
So he, yeah.

2491
01:32:57.96 --> 01:33:00.68
So he says, well, I did it in,

2492
01:33:00.68 --> 01:33:01.64
I met these people.

2493
01:33:01.64 --> 01:33:03.88
I was, I can't tell you where I've been.

2494
01:33:03.88 --> 01:33:05.60
I've been everywhere.

2495
01:33:05.60 --> 01:33:07.40
But I'm also friends with Higgin Machado.

2496
01:33:07.40 --> 01:33:08.72
And I was helping him.

2497
01:33:08.72 --> 01:33:09.56
He was helping me.

2498
01:33:09.56 --> 01:33:10.40
I guess we help each other.

2499
01:33:10.40 --> 01:33:13.16
We're friends in Beverly Hills at his school.

2500
01:33:13.16 --> 01:33:16.40
I was teaching Ashton Kutcher and all the John Wick guys.

2501
01:33:16.40 --> 01:33:19.12
And they had recommended Daniel Bernhardt.

2502
01:33:19.12 --> 01:33:20.20
So he's the director.

2503
01:33:20.20 --> 01:33:22.20
He's the guy that took over.

2504
01:33:22.20 --> 01:33:23.28
See, Michael or Daniel.

2505
01:33:23.28 --> 01:33:24.76
He took over after Van Dam.

2506
01:33:24.76 --> 01:33:26.000
Remember when I was like in kickboxers?

2507
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.48
Like Van Dam, then it became like some other guy.

2508
01:33:28.48 --> 01:33:29.88
That became him.

2509
01:33:29.88 --> 01:33:33.24
And then he is the director of all the Matrix stuff.

2510
01:33:33.24 --> 01:33:34.08
Oh, okay.

2511
01:33:34.08 --> 01:33:36.20
And so his kids liked me a lot.

2512
01:33:36.20 --> 01:33:38.48
I was teaching them private lessons.

2513
01:33:39.92 --> 01:33:40.76
Who else is it?

2514
01:33:40.76 --> 01:33:41.92
All the, Joey Diaz.

2515
01:33:41.92 --> 01:33:45.76
I gave, I got Joey Diaz in the jujitsu actually.

2516
01:33:45.76 --> 01:33:49.92
He, he did a comedy show in Chicago.

2517
01:33:49.92 --> 01:33:51.36
And he calls me, it was in Indiana.

2518
01:33:51.36 --> 01:33:52.20
He calls me up.

2519
01:33:52.20 --> 01:33:53.48
He's like, Peter Greek.

2520
01:33:53.48 --> 01:33:55.96
I haven't met you, but they tell me you're the guy.

2521
01:33:55.96 --> 01:33:56.88
If I'm in Chicago.

2522
01:33:56.88 --> 01:33:58.64
So I went out there to his comedy show.

2523
01:33:58.64 --> 01:34:00.96
And after his show, I'm like,

2524
01:34:00.96 --> 01:34:03.24
he was talking about martial arts with passion.

2525
01:34:03.24 --> 01:34:06.36
I'm like, dude, you need to join jujitsu.

2526
01:34:06.36 --> 01:34:07.64
And he's like, serious?

2527
01:34:07.64 --> 01:34:09.64
I'm like, and he got like a tear in his eyes.

2528
01:34:09.64 --> 01:34:11.28
And he went back when he went back home,

2529
01:34:11.28 --> 01:34:12.80
he actually joined.

2530
01:34:12.80 --> 01:34:15.16
And when I show up to Higgins,

2531
01:34:15.16 --> 01:34:17.60
I saw him there and I did a video and everything.

2532
01:34:17.60 --> 01:34:20.60
And Higgins is a cool dude.

2533
01:34:20.60 --> 01:34:21.68
I don't know why I even brought him up,

2534
01:34:21.68 --> 01:34:23.92
but I just think of him, he's like a Dean.

2535
01:34:23.92 --> 01:34:26.40
He's one of those big dudes that like,

2536
01:34:26.40 --> 01:34:28.84
that people just feel inspired around.

2537
01:34:28.84 --> 01:34:32.16
And she got to shoot.

2538
01:34:32.16 --> 01:34:34.12
If those guys met Glover, they would have went nuts.

2539
01:34:34.12 --> 01:34:35.80
Imagine they liked me, they're freaking.

2540
01:34:35.80 --> 01:34:38.64
No, Higgins used to make a point to come to me

2541
01:34:38.64 --> 01:34:41.16
at every tournament and say the nicest stuff to me, dog.

2542
01:34:41.16 --> 01:34:42.000
No kidding.

2543
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.96
Like this boy is genius, is genius.

2544
01:34:43.96 --> 01:34:45.36
You said like stuff like that back, dog.

2545
01:34:45.36 --> 01:34:46.60
You were so cool and nice to me.

2546
01:34:46.60 --> 01:34:47.44
Thank you.

2547
01:34:47.44 --> 01:34:49.56
We used to hang out Dean and Higgins and I in Brazil.

2548
01:34:49.56 --> 01:34:51.96
My dad and stuff, they was like our little crew.

2549
01:34:51.96 --> 01:34:53.32
And that's what Higgins did.

2550
01:34:53.32 --> 01:34:54.16
He went to everybody.

2551
01:34:54.16 --> 01:34:56.36
Like everybody that was coming up and was cool.

2552
01:34:56.36 --> 01:34:59.08
He would go up to them and just encourage the shit out of them.

2553
01:34:59.08 --> 01:34:59.92
That's pretty cool.

2554
01:34:59.92 --> 01:35:02.96
You know, there was like a zero player hater

2555
01:35:02.96 --> 01:35:04.68
in that dude's body.

2556
01:35:04.68 --> 01:35:05.96
And I have a rule with him.

2557
01:35:05.96 --> 01:35:08.64
Like we're not allowed to talk about jujitsu.

2558
01:35:08.64 --> 01:35:10.96
He likes me because I remember him of Carlson Gracie.

2559
01:35:10.96 --> 01:35:12.20
Carlson was his favorite uncle.

2560
01:35:12.20 --> 01:35:14.40
He's like, if the Machado brothers could have trained

2561
01:35:14.40 --> 01:35:16.68
with anyone, they wished they would have trained with Carlson

2562
01:35:16.68 --> 01:35:18.44
because that was this part that they didn't get into

2563
01:35:18.44 --> 01:35:19.96
as a mixed martial arts part

2564
01:35:19.96 --> 01:35:21.84
because they didn't have him as the coach.

2565
01:35:21.84 --> 01:35:24.24
Like if Carlson was our coach, we would have fought.

2566
01:35:24.24 --> 01:35:26.48
And so I remind Higgins of Carlson a lot.

2567
01:35:26.48 --> 01:35:27.64
He loves to have me around.

2568
01:35:27.64 --> 01:35:32.40
And I met all those high level people and Joey Diaz.

2569
01:35:32.40 --> 01:35:33.84
And I just want to say, man, thanks

2570
01:35:33.84 --> 01:35:35.88
because that was part of my rehab too.

2571
01:35:35.88 --> 01:35:39.16
Was I lived at Higgins house for a while.

2572
01:35:39.16 --> 01:35:41.40
You had rehab for your neck?

2573
01:35:41.40 --> 01:35:42.80
Yeah, just like,

2574
01:35:42.80 --> 01:35:43.80
or for your back.

2575
01:35:43.80 --> 01:35:44.64
Let me think which one it was.

2576
01:35:44.64 --> 01:35:45.60
Car accident.

2577
01:35:45.60 --> 01:35:47.44
The car accident got both of them.

2578
01:35:47.44 --> 01:35:49.88
Cause you got, I was on the news in Chicago.

2579
01:35:49.88 --> 01:35:50.72
It was a big thing.

2580
01:35:50.72 --> 01:35:53.36
Like it took me in all that stuff.

2581
01:35:53.36 --> 01:35:56.84
And that's the gang bangers tried to run off.

2582
01:35:56.84 --> 01:35:58.32
So they hit me and they ran off.

2583
01:35:58.32 --> 01:35:59.16
And it was funny.

2584
01:35:59.16 --> 01:36:00.60
I'm like, these fuckers are running

2585
01:36:00.60 --> 01:36:01.76
and they're running away.

2586
01:36:01.76 --> 01:36:02.96
They're running out of the minivan.

2587
01:36:02.96 --> 01:36:05.40
They hit me and then they just start dropping

2588
01:36:05.40 --> 01:36:06.60
cause they were injured too.

2589
01:36:06.60 --> 01:36:09.64
And then like they take me to the hospital

2590
01:36:09.64 --> 01:36:10.96
and they thought I was part of them.

2591
01:36:10.96 --> 01:36:12.56
They're like, no, just listen here, buddy.

2592
01:36:12.56 --> 01:36:14.24
I'm like, look, I'm the guy they got hit.

2593
01:36:14.24 --> 01:36:16.28
Like we don't want to hear that.

2594
01:36:16.28 --> 01:36:17.88
I'm like, get me out of here.

2595
01:36:17.88 --> 01:36:19.20
And I just left.

2596
01:36:19.20 --> 01:36:21.08
And that was like the same hospital.

2597
01:36:21.08 --> 01:36:22.64
And you see the Joker and Batman.

2598
01:36:22.64 --> 01:36:24.08
Like he's blowing it up.

2599
01:36:24.08 --> 01:36:25.16
It's called St. Elizabeth.

2600
01:36:25.16 --> 01:36:26.60
It's right over there in Chicago.

2601
01:36:26.60 --> 01:36:29.76
I live right in Chicago.

2602
01:36:29.76 --> 01:36:30.60
It was cool.

2603
01:36:30.60 --> 01:36:33.48
I mean, I come from a pizza family, a hot dog family.

2604
01:36:33.48 --> 01:36:34.60
I'm Sicilian and Greek.

2605
01:36:34.60 --> 01:36:38.12
So my grandma's side is the Rottolos.

2606
01:36:38.12 --> 01:36:38.96
It's funny.

2607
01:36:38.96 --> 01:36:39.80
They're Italian.

2608
01:36:39.80 --> 01:36:40.64
They're dad.

2609
01:36:40.64 --> 01:36:43.000
He's actually like, I think we're cousins.

2610
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.44
We feared it out last time.

2611
01:36:44.44 --> 01:36:47.52
Cause their, their restaurant they're related to

2612
01:36:47.52 --> 01:36:48.68
is called La Villa.

2613
01:36:48.68 --> 01:36:50.72
That's the last restaurant I ate at with my mom

2614
01:36:50.72 --> 01:36:52.24
before she passed away.

2615
01:36:52.24 --> 01:36:53.28
It's right by our house.

2616
01:36:53.28 --> 01:36:55.40
It's one of the old, old school restaurants.

2617
01:36:55.40 --> 01:36:57.28
Shoot.

2618
01:36:57.28 --> 01:36:58.72
Let's like this guy was from Chicago.

2619
01:36:58.72 --> 01:37:00.12
Chicago's, it's shy town.

2620
01:37:00.12 --> 01:37:00.96
It's a little town.

2621
01:37:00.96 --> 01:37:04.84
We all know each other and shoot Glover over here.

2622
01:37:04.84 --> 01:37:05.84
I'll tell you one thing.

2623
01:37:05.84 --> 01:37:07.68
I've met a lot of creative people.

2624
01:37:08.80 --> 01:37:11.44
Scotty was creative like Glover in his own way

2625
01:37:11.44 --> 01:37:13.64
as far as putting everyone together.

2626
01:37:13.64 --> 01:37:15.76
So Scott, I know I keep bringing up Scotty,

2627
01:37:15.76 --> 01:37:17.96
but man, I wouldn't have met any of these people

2628
01:37:17.96 --> 01:37:18.80
without him.

2629
01:37:18.80 --> 01:37:23.000
He like propelled Jiu-Jitsu through,

2630
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.12
provided a lot of fuel for Jiu-Jitsu

2631
01:37:25.12 --> 01:37:27.12
when there wasn't much fuel for Jiu-Jitsu.

2632
01:37:27.12 --> 01:37:29.56
In Brazil, he thought he was pocketed on.

2633
01:37:29.56 --> 01:37:31.08
He thought I was Carlson.

2634
01:37:31.08 --> 01:37:33.20
Glover's like Holes Gracie.

2635
01:37:33.20 --> 01:37:35.32
Like maybe like different spirits find,

2636
01:37:35.32 --> 01:37:36.72
I don't know, thinking like that.

2637
01:37:36.72 --> 01:37:39.92
Maybe we find them, but Holes and Carlson

2638
01:37:39.92 --> 01:37:41.76
were business partners.

2639
01:37:41.76 --> 01:37:44.56
Holes was the best black belt from the other side

2640
01:37:44.56 --> 01:37:45.60
of the family.

2641
01:37:45.60 --> 01:37:48.32
And when he became black belt,

2642
01:37:48.32 --> 01:37:49.96
he would come to Carlson's and train.

2643
01:37:49.96 --> 01:37:52.20
And sometimes these guys would beat him.

2644
01:37:52.20 --> 01:37:55.16
There was like two guys that could beat Holes at Carlson's

2645
01:37:55.16 --> 01:37:58.88
and Holes says, you know, I wanna train with you guys.

2646
01:37:58.88 --> 01:38:00.68
And so Holes came over and Carlson said,

2647
01:38:00.68 --> 01:38:03.68
wait a minute, you're not gonna teach at my class.

2648
01:38:03.68 --> 01:38:05.16
You can have your own class.

2649
01:38:06.08 --> 01:38:09.84
So at Carlson's school, they had two rooms.

2650
01:38:09.84 --> 01:38:12.80
So Carlson would teach in like room A Monday, Wednesday,

2651
01:38:12.80 --> 01:38:15.000
Friday, and then Holes would take that room Tuesday,

2652
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.28
Thursday, Saturday, switch and go to the other room

2653
01:38:17.28 --> 01:38:18.20
the other days.

2654
01:38:19.36 --> 01:38:21.20
And then they would have a friendly competition

2655
01:38:21.20 --> 01:38:23.000
between their students.

2656
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.44
And that's how they kept the level so high.

2657
01:38:25.44 --> 01:38:28.40
So when Holes got, Holes was black belt,

2658
01:38:28.40 --> 01:38:32.24
his best black belts were Carl, Carlinos Gracie.

2659
01:38:32.24 --> 01:38:35.68
You know, he had Fabio Santos, he had

2660
01:38:35.68 --> 01:38:37.88
and Carlos Gracie Jr.

2661
01:38:37.88 --> 01:38:40.36
But most of the guys went to Carlinos when Holes died

2662
01:38:40.36 --> 01:38:42.72
because they wanna stick with the Gracie family.

2663
01:38:42.72 --> 01:38:45.04
But the best one of those guys, not the competitor,

2664
01:38:45.04 --> 01:38:47.64
the most technical was Jacare Calvacante.

2665
01:38:47.64 --> 01:38:49.64
It would be like we're Franjina comes from there.

2666
01:38:49.64 --> 01:38:51.68
So that was the most technical of Holes.

2667
01:38:51.68 --> 01:38:53.36
The old, the white one.

2668
01:38:53.36 --> 01:38:54.20
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2669
01:38:54.20 --> 01:38:55.04
So he,

2670
01:38:56.16 --> 01:38:57.000
I went to his school.

2671
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:57.84
So that's how we're kinda like,

2672
01:38:57.84 --> 01:39:00.32
I'm more like Carlson side, like, you know,

2673
01:39:00.32 --> 01:39:02.12
no, it's not gonna work.

2674
01:39:02.12 --> 01:39:04.88
And Glover's like, no, no, no, just grab me here,

2675
01:39:04.88 --> 01:39:05.72
grab me there.

2676
01:39:05.72 --> 01:39:07.16
So that's why we're probably friends

2677
01:39:07.16 --> 01:39:11.20
because we kinda, we're kinda like opposites.

2678
01:39:11.20 --> 01:39:12.72
Jeff, what was the discussion you had

2679
01:39:12.72 --> 01:39:15.56
with Hannah Gracie the other day,

2680
01:39:15.56 --> 01:39:17.44
sport jiu-jitsu, self-defense?

2681
01:39:17.44 --> 01:39:19.36
What was that discussion about?

2682
01:39:21.92 --> 01:39:25.44
Yeah, it was like a meme that I saw and it was like self,

2683
01:39:25.44 --> 01:39:28.84
it was talking about how people in like self-defense

2684
01:39:28.84 --> 01:39:30.28
jiu-jitsu will say something like,

2685
01:39:30.28 --> 01:39:34.60
oh, they have problems with tournaments, sport jiu-jitsu.

2686
01:39:34.60 --> 01:39:37.16
I don't do that sport jiu-jitsu shit.

2687
01:39:37.16 --> 01:39:38.64
I do that self-defense style.

2688
01:39:38.64 --> 01:39:40.92
And it was like, imagine a boxer telling you that.

2689
01:39:40.92 --> 01:39:43.52
I've been like, I don't do that sport boxing shit.

2690
01:39:43.52 --> 01:39:45.56
I just do that self-defense boxing.

2691
01:39:45.56 --> 01:39:47.36
It's like, how crazy would they sound saying that?

2692
01:39:47.36 --> 01:39:49.32
So this is someone that might think,

2693
01:39:49.32 --> 01:39:51.60
well, you know, oh, you do that, you know,

2694
01:39:51.60 --> 01:39:54.48
you train on a mat with a guillon, that's not realistic.

2695
01:39:54.48 --> 01:39:56.32
So you'd get your ass kicked in a real fight.

2696
01:39:56.32 --> 01:39:59.04
I mean, listen, whatever it was, it was a funny ass meme.

2697
01:39:59.04 --> 01:40:00.64
And I posted it.

2698
01:40:00.64 --> 01:40:03.88
And then one of his students, some dude,

2699
01:40:03.88 --> 01:40:06.64
wrote just some pretty hostile like,

2700
01:40:06.64 --> 01:40:08.20
you don't know what you're talking about, shit Glover.

2701
01:40:08.20 --> 01:40:10.76
So I went to his page and I saw that he was like,

2702
01:40:10.76 --> 01:40:15.76
this scrawny 35 year old dude, like my size, you know?

2703
01:40:16.60 --> 01:40:19.08
And I'm like, I'm fucked this dude, you know?

2704
01:40:19.08 --> 01:40:21.16
So I like, I like to go,

2705
01:40:21.16 --> 01:40:23.60
I took a screenshot of his belt that he had

2706
01:40:23.60 --> 01:40:25.12
because he had a belt that I had never seen.

2707
01:40:25.12 --> 01:40:25.96
And I'm like, what is this?

2708
01:40:25.96 --> 01:40:27.92
Some karate belt, you know?

2709
01:40:27.92 --> 01:40:29.48
And I was like, look at this is the kind of guy

2710
01:40:29.48 --> 01:40:31.88
who like argues with me about anything in jiu-jitsu

2711
01:40:31.88 --> 01:40:33.84
is some dude who doesn't even do jiu-jitsu.

2712
01:40:33.84 --> 01:40:35.44
And Hannah was like, hey, what up, Jeff?

2713
01:40:35.44 --> 01:40:37.000
Send me a message.

2714
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:37.84
Da-da-da.

2715
01:40:37.84 --> 01:40:40.000
And I found out that Hannah has his own belting system.

2716
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.08
I didn't know that dog.

2717
01:40:41.08 --> 01:40:41.92
I didn't know that.

2718
01:40:41.92 --> 01:40:43.04
I didn't know I was personally, he was like,

2719
01:40:43.04 --> 01:40:45.24
oh, that was a personal attack, bro.

2720
01:40:45.24 --> 01:40:47.12
And I was like, hey, first of all, as your friend,

2721
01:40:47.12 --> 01:40:48.40
because I've known him for a long time

2722
01:40:48.40 --> 01:40:50.44
since we were both like, you know, 17.

2723
01:40:50.44 --> 01:40:51.28
I was like, as your friend,

2724
01:40:51.28 --> 01:40:52.76
if you feel like I personally attacked you,

2725
01:40:52.76 --> 01:40:55.000
honestly, whatever it was, I apologize.

2726
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.32
I was like, I don't wanna personally attack you.

2727
01:40:56.32 --> 01:40:57.16
You're the man, dude.

2728
01:40:57.16 --> 01:40:58.28
But like on a professional level,

2729
01:40:58.28 --> 01:41:01.32
I didn't know you had your own belting system.

2730
01:41:01.32 --> 01:41:04.28
And that I was like making fun of one of your dudes.

2731
01:41:04.28 --> 01:41:05.60
You know what I'm saying?

2732
01:41:05.60 --> 01:41:06.44
And he's like, yeah, dog,

2733
01:41:06.44 --> 01:41:07.84
we have this whole system, da-da-da.

2734
01:41:07.84 --> 01:41:10.44
He explained it to me for like an hour.

2735
01:41:10.44 --> 01:41:11.92
And you know, I have ADD, dude.

2736
01:41:11.92 --> 01:41:12.76
I can't be listening to you.

2737
01:41:12.76 --> 01:41:14.16
I can't imagine you having it in one hour.

2738
01:41:14.16 --> 01:41:15.000
Dude, I was like-

2739
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.32
I'm pretty surprised we're holding an hour right now.

2740
01:41:16.32 --> 01:41:18.04
Well, that's how I ended the conversation.

2741
01:41:18.04 --> 01:41:20.40
I was like, the weed is wearing off.

2742
01:41:20.40 --> 01:41:21.44
You made your point.

2743
01:41:21.44 --> 01:41:22.28
You know what I'm saying?

2744
01:41:22.28 --> 01:41:23.84
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

2745
01:41:24.76 --> 01:41:26.84
Yeah, we all do basic jujitsu,

2746
01:41:26.84 --> 01:41:28.72
but I don't think like,

2747
01:41:28.72 --> 01:41:30.80
I don't think like people who only do self-defense

2748
01:41:30.80 --> 01:41:34.44
will ever be able to beat somebody who does sport jujitsu.

2749
01:41:34.44 --> 01:41:36.12
And that's the end of my point.

2750
01:41:36.12 --> 01:41:39.48
I had a guy on social media over the last couple of days.

2751
01:41:40.44 --> 01:41:41.84
He posted something.

2752
01:41:41.84 --> 01:41:44.48
I wish I could get the exact quote for you.

2753
01:41:44.48 --> 01:41:45.60
But it was something like this.

2754
01:41:45.60 --> 01:41:48.28
And I get the spirit of what he was saying.

2755
01:41:48.28 --> 01:41:51.36
He said, you know, I know this guy,

2756
01:41:51.36 --> 01:41:52.60
it was something along the lines like,

2757
01:41:52.60 --> 01:41:55.28
this guy wants me to train jujitsu,

2758
01:41:55.28 --> 01:41:57.52
but I told him, listen,

2759
01:41:57.52 --> 01:42:02.52
there's a difference between jujitsu and crazy old Marine.

2760
01:42:02.52 --> 01:42:06.04
And you're not going to be armbar in me

2761
01:42:06.04 --> 01:42:08.52
when I'm gouging eyes, right?

2762
01:42:08.52 --> 01:42:09.36
And so that was the comment.

2763
01:42:09.36 --> 01:42:10.52
And he kind of like thought,

2764
01:42:10.52 --> 01:42:12.84
he probably thought like I'd be like, hell yeah,

2765
01:42:12.84 --> 01:42:15.12
because I love the Marines and I love the military.

2766
01:42:15.12 --> 01:42:17.16
But I haven't responded to him yet,

2767
01:42:17.16 --> 01:42:18.000
but I'm going to respond to him.

2768
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.32
And I'm going to say, hey, bro, like,

2769
01:42:20.32 --> 01:42:22.96
actually you're not going to be gouging anybody's eyes

2770
01:42:22.96 --> 01:42:24.52
when you're getting choked and arm locked

2771
01:42:24.52 --> 01:42:26.16
because that's what's really going to happen.

2772
01:42:26.16 --> 01:42:29.72
And, you know, Dean always has a good explanation of like,

2773
01:42:29.72 --> 01:42:34.000
oh, you know, some of the guy will say to Dean,

2774
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.92
like, well, yeah, I would just like bite your face.

2775
01:42:36.92 --> 01:42:40.08
And Dean, Dean's like, yeah, cool, then I'll be mad.

2776
01:42:40.08 --> 01:42:40.92
Yeah. Nice.

2777
01:42:40.92 --> 01:42:43.56
You know, cause then you make Dean mad.

2778
01:42:43.56 --> 01:42:44.84
Well, you make a jujitsu guy mad.

2779
01:42:44.84 --> 01:42:47.12
So now when they're mounted on you,

2780
01:42:47.12 --> 01:42:48.56
like they're gonna bite your face.

2781
01:42:48.56 --> 01:42:52.28
Yeah, we had a friend here that was a seal,

2782
01:42:52.28 --> 01:42:55.64
a jujitsu guy and he got into a street fight.

2783
01:42:55.64 --> 01:42:59.20
And he like was a cross side on the dude.

2784
01:42:59.20 --> 01:43:00.96
You might remember, he got his ear bitten off,

2785
01:43:00.96 --> 01:43:02.88
like kind of not bitten off, but like,

2786
01:43:02.88 --> 01:43:06.80
if you took a piece of pizza and like turned it to the side

2787
01:43:06.80 --> 01:43:08.68
and took a bite, not out of like this,

2788
01:43:08.68 --> 01:43:11.000
the tip of the triangle, but like out of the side,

2789
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.32
it looked like that, like just a bite was gone.

2790
01:43:13.32 --> 01:43:14.60
You know what I'm saying?

2791
01:43:14.60 --> 01:43:18.80
Like a bite was gone of this dude, of this seal's ear.

2792
01:43:19.88 --> 01:43:21.92
But now what happened in the fight?

2793
01:43:21.92 --> 01:43:23.44
Now he was pissed.

2794
01:43:23.44 --> 01:43:24.28
Oh, man.

2795
01:43:24.28 --> 01:43:26.56
Oh yeah, I mean, he just like annihilated this guy,

2796
01:43:26.56 --> 01:43:28.36
could have killed him or whatever.

2797
01:43:28.36 --> 01:43:31.36
But yeah, so that self-defense stuff of like,

2798
01:43:31.36 --> 01:43:36.04
well, I'll kick you in the nuts or I'll gouge you

2799
01:43:36.04 --> 01:43:37.28
or I'll fish hook you.

2800
01:43:37.28 --> 01:43:40.08
No, you actually, or you may, maybe you will,

2801
01:43:40.08 --> 01:43:41.60
but it's not gonna help.

2802
01:43:41.60 --> 01:43:42.44
It's not gonna help.

2803
01:43:42.44 --> 01:43:45.000
And the other thing is like, oh, well, oh, jujitsu,

2804
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.44
why would you wanna go to the ground in self-defense?

2805
01:43:48.44 --> 01:43:49.64
Don't wanna go to the ground in self-defense.

2806
01:43:49.64 --> 01:43:50.64
Hopefully you don't have to.

2807
01:43:50.64 --> 01:43:52.28
Hopefully you just knock a dude out, you know?

2808
01:43:52.28 --> 01:43:55.24
Hopefully you just, you know, give him a nice one, two, three

2809
01:43:55.24 --> 01:43:56.68
and the dude's knocked out and you move on,

2810
01:43:56.68 --> 01:43:57.64
carry on with your day.

2811
01:43:57.64 --> 01:43:59.80
Yeah, but we landed there and now we're here.

2812
01:43:59.80 --> 01:44:03.20
Yeah, but all of a sudden I got, you know, gang tackled

2813
01:44:03.20 --> 01:44:05.12
or tackled by somebody or a trip to fell.

2814
01:44:05.12 --> 01:44:07.52
And now the only way I can handle this situation

2815
01:44:07.52 --> 01:44:08.96
is if I know how to get back all my feet

2816
01:44:08.96 --> 01:44:11.20
and do jujitsu or unbox somebody or whatever.

2817
01:44:11.20 --> 01:44:12.76
And I'm a purple belt pan am champ,

2818
01:44:12.76 --> 01:44:13.92
so guess what's gonna happen?

2819
01:44:13.92 --> 01:44:16.24
Yeah, we do all that shit you just said.

2820
01:44:16.24 --> 01:44:20.24
Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be not good.

2821
01:44:20.24 --> 01:44:23.04
So yeah, that's definitely something to think about.

2822
01:44:23.04 --> 01:44:27.48
Have you ever had, how has jujitsu performed for you

2823
01:44:27.48 --> 01:44:28.44
in the streets?

2824
01:44:28.44 --> 01:44:30.32
I mean, I've never lost a street fight.

2825
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.04
I'm a witness.

2826
01:44:34.92 --> 01:44:38.000
What is your go-to move in a street fight?

2827
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.20
No, you're not.

2828
01:44:39.20 --> 01:44:40.80
You've never seen me fight anybody.

2829
01:44:43.08 --> 01:44:44.40
I'm a witness.

2830
01:44:44.40 --> 01:44:45.68
Oh no, I'm not a witness.

2831
01:44:45.68 --> 01:44:46.68
That's right.

2832
01:44:46.68 --> 01:44:47.68
Ripping statement.

2833
01:44:50.16 --> 01:44:51.000
Dude, you know what?

2834
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.28
You're just imagining how kick ass it would be.

2835
01:44:53.28 --> 01:44:55.04
But that's what happens when Glover tells you

2836
01:44:55.04 --> 01:44:57.000
about a fight that he had, it's like, I'm there.

2837
01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:57.84
Like I already imagined it,

2838
01:44:57.84 --> 01:44:59.44
cause I know his moves, he's like, yeah,

2839
01:44:59.44 --> 01:45:02.64
I double-legged the guy, ran around him, I left at him.

2840
01:45:02.64 --> 01:45:03.72
He tried to chase me.

2841
01:45:03.72 --> 01:45:04.56
That must be so crazy.

2842
01:45:04.56 --> 01:45:05.88
That's what I was trying to say with Hinner,

2843
01:45:05.88 --> 01:45:08.36
is that Hinner is like, he fails to mention

2844
01:45:08.36 --> 01:45:10.80
that he's a bad ass wrestler dog.

2845
01:45:10.80 --> 01:45:12.52
He's a dope ass boxer.

2846
01:45:12.52 --> 01:45:13.36
You know what I'm saying?

2847
01:45:13.36 --> 01:45:14.92
It's like, how did you win streets fights?

2848
01:45:14.92 --> 01:45:16.92
I'm like, I never really used jujitsu.

2849
01:45:16.92 --> 01:45:18.40
I always like faked double legs

2850
01:45:18.40 --> 01:45:20.20
and then punched the shit out of you

2851
01:45:20.20 --> 01:45:22.32
when they fell to the, oh, I'm gonna get double-legged

2852
01:45:22.32 --> 01:45:23.32
and I punched them and I was like,

2853
01:45:23.32 --> 01:45:26.32
well, didn't even use any jujitsu there.

2854
01:45:26.32 --> 01:45:27.32
But, but, no.

2855
01:45:27.32 --> 01:45:29.32
Well, my coach was with, with Ilyo.

2856
01:45:29.32 --> 01:45:32.08
He was, he was his best student.

2857
01:45:32.08 --> 01:45:34.80
Look, on this subject, it's like I started off with,

2858
01:45:34.80 --> 01:45:37.56
many truths exist at the same time with this subject.

2859
01:45:37.56 --> 01:45:38.88
Oh.

2860
01:45:38.88 --> 01:45:42.12
They're both true and they're both exist at the same time.

2861
01:45:42.12 --> 01:45:43.60
And it's almost pointless to talk about this.

2862
01:45:43.60 --> 01:45:45.28
What do you call it, a paradox?

2863
01:45:45.28 --> 01:45:46.28
What do you call that?

2864
01:45:46.28 --> 01:45:47.12
I don't know, what do you guys call that?

2865
01:45:47.12 --> 01:45:47.96
They're like loaded in questions.

2866
01:45:47.96 --> 01:45:48.80
They sound like something echoing.

2867
01:45:48.80 --> 01:45:49.64
As far as like jujitsu.

2868
01:45:49.64 --> 01:45:53.04
Yeah, I do a lot of times when people have a strong argument

2869
01:45:53.04 --> 01:45:56.80
for against their, they look at it, what my brother would

2870
01:45:56.80 --> 01:45:58.000
call it in a vacuum.

2871
01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.56
So they'll take a very individual thing unchallenged

2872
01:46:00.56 --> 01:46:02.68
in the real world kind of a thing.

2873
01:46:02.68 --> 01:46:04.68
And then a concept.

2874
01:46:04.68 --> 01:46:06.36
No, I'm not saying jujitsu as a whole.

2875
01:46:06.36 --> 01:46:07.20
Just like how you said,

2876
01:46:07.20 --> 01:46:09.000
bro, there's so many truths going on in there.

2877
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.32
But I'm saying a concept and then they'll challenge it

2878
01:46:11.32 --> 01:46:15.28
against sometimes a straw man, but sometimes not another

2879
01:46:15.28 --> 01:46:18.48
in the vacuum concept and then they'll go to battle.

2880
01:46:18.48 --> 01:46:22.16
But a lot of times, especially kind of what you were saying

2881
01:46:22.16 --> 01:46:23.28
in that debate.

2882
01:46:23.28 --> 01:46:24.68
Do you know what straw man is Pete?

2883
01:46:24.68 --> 01:46:25.88
No.

2884
01:46:25.88 --> 01:46:26.72
Like the worst example.

2885
01:46:26.72 --> 01:46:27.92
I'll let Echo explain it.

2886
01:46:27.92 --> 01:46:30.000
In a nutshell, it's like the worst example of someone's

2887
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.16
side, it's usually like inaccurate.

2888
01:46:32.16 --> 01:46:35.28
Oh, I got it, now I understand.

2889
01:46:35.28 --> 01:46:38.12
But either way, like when you talk about a competitor

2890
01:46:38.12 --> 01:46:41.12
in jujitsu and then the other side would be like,

2891
01:46:41.12 --> 01:46:44.12
oh, you would never pull guard on the street,

2892
01:46:44.12 --> 01:46:47.12
which is true, but then they're representing that

2893
01:46:47.12 --> 01:46:48.80
as like their position.

2894
01:46:48.80 --> 01:46:50.12
I wouldn't say never.

2895
01:46:50.12 --> 01:46:50.96
I wouldn't never say never.

2896
01:46:50.96 --> 01:46:52.28
They'd say they'd say never.

2897
01:46:52.28 --> 01:46:53.12
They'd say they'd say never.

2898
01:46:53.12 --> 01:46:53.96
They'd say they'd say never.

2899
01:46:53.96 --> 01:46:54.80
They'd say they'd say never.

2900
01:46:54.80 --> 01:46:57.20
And then even that, that's not necessarily true.

2901
01:46:57.20 --> 01:46:59.12
Maybe for Jeff and that's all.

2902
01:46:59.12 --> 01:47:00.44
No, because if you jump full guard,

2903
01:47:00.44 --> 01:47:02.000
you're gonna land straight on the pavement.

2904
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.36
And to Henners credit, he did say some things that,

2905
01:47:06.36 --> 01:47:08.80
I think the jujitsu community wanted to hear him say.

2906
01:47:08.80 --> 01:47:11.28
I asked him if he thought John Danerher was the number one

2907
01:47:11.28 --> 01:47:12.12
dude in the world right now.

2908
01:47:12.12 --> 01:47:12.96
What did he say?

2909
01:47:12.96 --> 01:47:13.80
I'm like, is we all agree on that?

2910
01:47:13.80 --> 01:47:14.84
Do you agree with that?

2911
01:47:14.84 --> 01:47:16.64
Or are you gonna say your grandpa?

2912
01:47:16.64 --> 01:47:17.48
You don't say anything?

2913
01:47:17.48 --> 01:47:18.72
He said, yeah, John Daner is number one.

2914
01:47:18.72 --> 01:47:19.56
I can't deny that.

2915
01:47:19.56 --> 01:47:20.40
Cool.

2916
01:47:20.40 --> 01:47:22.72
And I was like, okay, do you think jujitsu guys

2917
01:47:22.72 --> 01:47:25.24
who do tournaments can win street fights?

2918
01:47:25.24 --> 01:47:26.72
And he was like, yes, I agree with that.

2919
01:47:26.72 --> 01:47:29.36
Well, you know, I was like, cool, that's all I was saying.

2920
01:47:29.36 --> 01:47:31.12
I was like, I don't disagree with anything he says.

2921
01:47:31.12 --> 01:47:32.36
Yeah, and see, and then that's,

2922
01:47:32.36 --> 01:47:36.000
so the conflict really comes when the interchangeability

2923
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.92
of generalities versus specifics kind of goes on.

2924
01:47:38.92 --> 01:47:39.76
And that's how it goes.

2925
01:47:39.76 --> 01:47:40.60
It's not going deep right now.

2926
01:47:40.60 --> 01:47:41.44
No, I meant, yeah.

2927
01:47:41.44 --> 01:47:42.28
I'm just gonna say that.

2928
01:47:42.28 --> 01:47:44.12
And look, if someone could always say,

2929
01:47:44.12 --> 01:47:46.60
generally speaking, if someone always could say that,

2930
01:47:46.60 --> 01:47:49.88
and then when they go specific, they say, well, specific.

2931
01:47:49.88 --> 01:47:50.72
That's great.

2932
01:47:50.72 --> 01:47:53.28
A lot of specifics have no place in a general argument.

2933
01:47:53.28 --> 01:47:54.12
That's great.

2934
01:47:54.12 --> 01:47:55.08
So people don't understand that.

2935
01:47:55.08 --> 01:47:56.68
So they get this, this week's console.

2936
01:47:56.68 --> 01:47:59.32
Line jujitsu coming out of a freaking apple top.

2937
01:47:59.32 --> 01:48:00.64
It's the way it works.

2938
01:48:00.64 --> 01:48:01.96
See it happening all the time.

2939
01:48:01.96 --> 01:48:03.68
Write that down, Pete.

2940
01:48:03.68 --> 01:48:06.60
Jeff, generalities are different in specifics.

2941
01:48:06.60 --> 01:48:08.32
Yeah.

2942
01:48:08.32 --> 01:48:10.48
I always say I'm one of the worst people

2943
01:48:10.48 --> 01:48:15.000
to introduce people to jujitsu because I'm like big and strong.

2944
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.84
And so if I, when I would like introduce someone to jujitsu,

2945
01:48:18.84 --> 01:48:21.000
they'd be like, well, that's just because you're big and strong.

2946
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.96
Matter of fact, to this day, someone will be like, well,

2947
01:48:22.96 --> 01:48:23.92
yeah, good role.

2948
01:48:23.92 --> 01:48:25.000
You're really strong.

2949
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.48
You're big and strong or whatever.

2950
01:48:26.48 --> 01:48:27.56
And I'm always like, yeah, thanks, man.

2951
01:48:27.56 --> 01:48:28.72
That's why I lift.

2952
01:48:28.72 --> 01:48:29.56
Hell yeah.

2953
01:48:29.56 --> 01:48:34.48
But Jeff, I think you're like, I think you're the ultimate.

2954
01:48:34.48 --> 01:48:35.56
I lift too, but yeah.

2955
01:48:35.56 --> 01:48:36.72
I think you're the ultimate person

2956
01:48:36.72 --> 01:48:39.44
to introduce jujitsu to other people

2957
01:48:39.44 --> 01:48:41.56
because you are unassuming.

2958
01:48:41.56 --> 01:48:43.68
And what made me think of that is, dude,

2959
01:48:43.68 --> 01:48:50.08
I can't imagine the fool and how crappy it is when someone sees

2960
01:48:50.08 --> 01:48:53.48
you and they're like, I'm going to talk some shit to this little

2961
01:48:53.48 --> 01:48:54.76
skinny white kid right now.

2962
01:48:54.76 --> 01:48:57.04
Oh, it happens.

2963
01:48:57.04 --> 01:48:58.48
I've been a witness.

2964
01:48:58.48 --> 01:48:59.48
Wait.

2965
01:48:59.48 --> 01:49:03.92
I know nothing.

2966
01:49:03.92 --> 01:49:05.64
Aren't you Mexican though?

2967
01:49:05.64 --> 01:49:08.68
My dad is half Mexican now, pretty much.

2968
01:49:08.68 --> 01:49:10.000
So you are Mexican, is that it?

2969
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:10.50
Yeah.

2970
01:49:10.50 --> 01:49:11.24
Well, my dad.

2971
01:49:11.24 --> 01:49:12.60
Boy, you look like a white boy, man.

2972
01:49:12.60 --> 01:49:13.68
He speaks Spanish.

2973
01:49:13.68 --> 01:49:17.20
He's like half white, half Cherokee Indian.

2974
01:49:17.20 --> 01:49:18.40
But they would just say Mexican.

2975
01:49:18.40 --> 01:49:21.72
Wait, your dad is half white and half Cherokee Indian.

2976
01:49:21.72 --> 01:49:24.44
Is your mom like the whitest person ever?

2977
01:49:24.44 --> 01:49:25.52
She is, yeah.

2978
01:49:25.52 --> 01:49:26.52
Because damn.

2979
01:49:26.52 --> 01:49:27.36
Yeah, I'm white.

2980
01:49:27.36 --> 01:49:29.36
You are white.

2981
01:49:29.36 --> 01:49:31.80
Dude, it would look crazy when I'd be with my grandma.

2982
01:49:31.80 --> 01:49:33.24
People would think she like kidnapped me.

2983
01:49:33.24 --> 01:49:38.52
All right.

2984
01:49:38.52 --> 01:49:39.68
ADCC.

2985
01:49:39.68 --> 01:49:42.12
So speaking of which, I saw you up there this year.

2986
01:49:42.12 --> 01:49:44.16
What did you think of everything?

2987
01:49:44.16 --> 01:49:45.56
What was your impression?

2988
01:49:45.56 --> 01:49:46.96
Let me start off by saying this.

2989
01:49:46.96 --> 01:49:48.60
Yeah, it's great.

2990
01:49:48.60 --> 01:49:50.96
Bro, when I went and saw you when I was talking about going

2991
01:49:50.96 --> 01:49:55.80
to see you at the ADCC trials, that was literally in like a,

2992
01:49:55.80 --> 01:49:58.52
what was it, in like a hotel back room or something?

2993
01:49:58.52 --> 01:49:59.44
There's a hotel ballroom.

2994
01:49:59.44 --> 01:50:00.72
Yeah, like a hotel ballroom.

2995
01:50:00.72 --> 01:50:03.68
Not a nice hotel either, but just like some shitty hotel.

2996
01:50:03.68 --> 01:50:05.52
And they put some mats on the floor.

2997
01:50:05.52 --> 01:50:06.32
I thought it was nice.

2998
01:50:06.32 --> 01:50:08.80
There's like 200 people watching, right?

2999
01:50:08.80 --> 01:50:09.40
Less than that.

3000
01:50:09.40 --> 01:50:10.20
Less than that.

3001
01:50:10.20 --> 01:50:11.04
Just the people there.

3002
01:50:11.04 --> 01:50:12.20
There was no one to be watching.

3003
01:50:12.20 --> 01:50:14.16
Yeah, actually, there's just people competing and then

3004
01:50:14.16 --> 01:50:16.80
there's people competing and then watching others compete.

3005
01:50:16.80 --> 01:50:19.48
Yeah.

3006
01:50:19.48 --> 01:50:20.96
This one was crazy.

3007
01:50:20.96 --> 01:50:22.000
It was epic.

3008
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.04
There was 15,000 people in a big damn stadium.

3009
01:50:26.04 --> 01:50:31.04
And the Jiu Jitsu was just freaking nuts to watch.

3010
01:50:31.04 --> 01:50:32.64
It was nuts to watch.

3011
01:50:32.64 --> 01:50:36.24
What are you seeing in the evolution of Jiu Jitsu right now?

3012
01:50:36.24 --> 01:50:37.08
It's interesting, right?

3013
01:50:37.08 --> 01:50:38.92
And I have a very interesting perspective.

3014
01:50:38.92 --> 01:50:40.16
I wish I could explain it.

3015
01:50:40.16 --> 01:50:42.36
I wish I had the vocabulary to explain that.

3016
01:50:42.36 --> 01:50:47.96
But remember when you first saw those first ADCC matches

3017
01:50:47.96 --> 01:50:53.28
with the chic and they're like, the drums

3018
01:50:53.28 --> 01:50:55.36
and the Arab dudes playing drums in the background?

3019
01:50:55.36 --> 01:50:57.20
And it was something so magical.

3020
01:50:57.20 --> 01:50:58.96
It was like being a kid again.

3021
01:50:58.96 --> 01:51:01.72
It was like all of a sudden, remember when you found out

3022
01:51:01.72 --> 01:51:03.40
pro wrestling was fake?

3023
01:51:03.40 --> 01:51:04.24
You know what I'm saying?

3024
01:51:04.24 --> 01:51:05.20
You were so heartbroken.

3025
01:51:05.20 --> 01:51:06.04
I was.

3026
01:51:06.04 --> 01:51:07.16
And then I found Abu Dhabi.

3027
01:51:07.16 --> 01:51:09.24
And I was like, oh my god, it's not like pro wrestling's real

3028
01:51:09.24 --> 01:51:09.44
again.

3029
01:51:09.44 --> 01:51:10.08
It's real.

3030
01:51:10.08 --> 01:51:12.04
You know, these dudes are real real.

3031
01:51:12.04 --> 01:51:13.32
Like Dean's a real fucking pro.

3032
01:51:13.32 --> 01:51:17.12
Like Macho Man is like, you know, that was like Dean Lister.

3033
01:51:17.12 --> 01:51:18.76
Dean's Lister is like a real life Macho Man.

3034
01:51:18.76 --> 01:51:20.92
You know?

3035
01:51:20.92 --> 01:51:24.96
So yeah, it's just every year it's always so special.

3036
01:51:24.96 --> 01:51:29.24
You could go back and watch ADCC 1996 and untrained eye

3037
01:51:29.24 --> 01:51:32.56
and watch that shit and be like, wow, that's fucking amazing.

3038
01:51:32.56 --> 01:51:35.64
I can't imagine somebody who just started Jiu Jitsu last year

3039
01:51:35.64 --> 01:51:38.40
watching ADCC and being like, oh, what am I getting myself

3040
01:51:38.40 --> 01:51:38.72
into?

3041
01:51:38.72 --> 01:51:40.000
That was crazy.

3042
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.32
You know, am I going to be doing that?

3043
01:51:41.32 --> 01:51:42.44
Like, whoa.

3044
01:51:42.44 --> 01:51:48.44
It's just, yeah, it's, I don't know how people don't want to do it.

3045
01:51:48.44 --> 01:51:52.60
What do you think about the evolution of the game?

3046
01:51:52.60 --> 01:51:54.16
Like what it looks like now?

3047
01:51:54.16 --> 01:51:55.04
It's a tough question.

3048
01:51:55.04 --> 01:51:56.04
People ask that one.

3049
01:51:56.04 --> 01:51:56.84
That's a tough one.

3050
01:51:56.84 --> 01:51:57.68
I don't know.

3051
01:51:57.68 --> 01:51:58.64
Has it really evolved?

3052
01:51:58.64 --> 01:52:00.48
We're all just going for neck, arms, and legs.

3053
01:52:00.48 --> 01:52:01.56
Yeah, that's true.

3054
01:52:01.56 --> 01:52:04.76
I was pleasantly surprised the last couple

3055
01:52:04.76 --> 01:52:08.68
matches in big tournaments I've been watching because like,

3056
01:52:08.68 --> 01:52:11.48
I'll be here and training.

3057
01:52:11.48 --> 01:52:14.32
And like, this is an example.

3058
01:52:14.32 --> 01:52:16.64
I'm freaking trying to pass Dean's Guard,

3059
01:52:16.64 --> 01:52:19.36
trying to pass Wes' Guard, whatever.

3060
01:52:19.36 --> 01:52:20.80
What's your, like, Echo's Guard.

3061
01:52:20.80 --> 01:52:24.64
Like, they spend a lot of time trying to pass Guard.

3062
01:52:24.64 --> 01:52:27.48
And man, sometimes I think, dude, I just suck at Jiu Jitsu.

3063
01:52:27.48 --> 01:52:30.40
Now I need to freaking, you know, like just find a new sport

3064
01:52:30.40 --> 01:52:32.96
to go start playing croquet or some shit, you know, like.

3065
01:52:32.96 --> 01:52:34.12
Why, because you're bored?

3066
01:52:34.12 --> 01:52:35.44
No, because I suck.

3067
01:52:35.44 --> 01:52:37.56
And I'm like, dude, I suck.

3068
01:52:37.56 --> 01:52:39.96
And then we'll go and watch, like, at ECC.

3069
01:52:39.96 --> 01:52:40.76
I was like, I was watching.

3070
01:52:40.76 --> 01:52:42.32
I was like, that's right.

3071
01:52:42.32 --> 01:52:45.000
And I'd realized this six months ago.

3072
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.96
I was like, oh, this is what Jiu Jitsu looks like more now.

3073
01:52:48.96 --> 01:52:49.92
People are better.

3074
01:52:49.92 --> 01:52:51.04
Their guard is better.

3075
01:52:51.04 --> 01:52:53.000
Their leg attacks are better.

3076
01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.92
You can't dive into stuff the way you could.

3077
01:52:56.92 --> 01:52:58.40
Everyone's just better.

3078
01:52:58.40 --> 01:53:02.60
So it takes more skill and more time to pass the Guard.

3079
01:53:02.60 --> 01:53:04.76
And as I watched all these matches, I'm like, yeah,

3080
01:53:04.76 --> 01:53:07.000
this is, it's just a different game.

3081
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.16
Now there are evolutions that are happening right now.

3082
01:53:11.16 --> 01:53:13.44
And I'm seeing like, Pete, you were talking about them

3083
01:53:13.44 --> 01:53:14.28
some of the other night.

3084
01:53:14.28 --> 01:53:17.32
Well, we're trying to do like, OK, so with the IBGF

3085
01:53:17.32 --> 01:53:22.04
tournaments that were before, well, they still have them now.

3086
01:53:22.04 --> 01:53:25.36
You don't have to be specifically too good at that many skills.

3087
01:53:25.36 --> 01:53:27.48
You could be good at two or three positions

3088
01:53:27.48 --> 01:53:29.96
and hold the person and win.

3089
01:53:29.96 --> 01:53:32.28
But now at these tournaments are submission only,

3090
01:53:32.28 --> 01:53:34.60
or Glover has a tenor tap system.

3091
01:53:34.60 --> 01:53:36.84
There's ADCC systems.

3092
01:53:36.84 --> 01:53:39.24
You're getting penalized for just holding a guy in one

3093
01:53:39.24 --> 01:53:40.80
position.

3094
01:53:40.80 --> 01:53:44.68
So with no g, you're not going to be able to hold anyone down

3095
01:53:44.68 --> 01:53:45.40
under sweaty.

3096
01:53:45.40 --> 01:53:48.20
So what people are doing now is leaning on the person

3097
01:53:48.20 --> 01:53:50.32
and making them carry the weight.

3098
01:53:50.32 --> 01:53:53.44
And then on the bottom, you're pretty much.

3099
01:53:53.44 --> 01:53:54.04
That's not changed.

3100
01:53:54.04 --> 01:53:55.000
It's always been like that.

3101
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:55.80
I guess so.

3102
01:53:55.80 --> 01:53:57.88
I'm finding more of the evolutions coming in.

3103
01:53:57.88 --> 01:53:58.52
OK, pretty much.

3104
01:53:58.52 --> 01:54:00.24
I'm failing to find that.

3105
01:54:00.24 --> 01:54:02.24
Yeah, there's, yeah, it's just like.

3106
01:54:02.24 --> 01:54:03.36
It's just different styles.

3107
01:54:03.36 --> 01:54:04.04
It's always going to look.

3108
01:54:04.04 --> 01:54:04.88
That's what's so cool about this.

3109
01:54:04.88 --> 01:54:05.92
It's always new and what's new is old.

3110
01:54:05.92 --> 01:54:08.56
Look at these old Greek guys like Achilles and Zeus.

3111
01:54:08.56 --> 01:54:11.000
And like those dudes knew how to grapple.

3112
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.24
I guarantee you, like, who are you kidding?

3113
01:54:13.24 --> 01:54:14.84
Didn't he come up with the Achilles lock?

3114
01:54:14.84 --> 01:54:15.80
Yeah, all that stuff.

3115
01:54:15.80 --> 01:54:16.48
You know what I mean?

3116
01:54:16.48 --> 01:54:18.12
They had the wristlock guy.

3117
01:54:18.12 --> 01:54:19.72
They had all that stuff.

3118
01:54:19.72 --> 01:54:22.20
When did you get all freaking focused on wristlocks

3119
01:54:22.20 --> 01:54:23.92
while we're going down this rabbit hole?

3120
01:54:23.92 --> 01:54:28.44
OK, so when I lived in Brazil, I lost it.

3121
01:54:28.44 --> 01:54:31.28
In the world, it was like my fifth match in Oswaldo

3122
01:54:31.28 --> 01:54:31.80
Alves there.

3123
01:54:31.80 --> 01:54:33.36
He's an old guy with Andre Gauvara.

3124
01:54:33.36 --> 01:54:34.72
Just tell the story kind of faster.

3125
01:54:34.72 --> 01:54:36.000
The way he's wearing off.

3126
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:36.88
Come on, Peter.

3127
01:54:36.88 --> 01:54:38.20
So they come live with us.

3128
01:54:38.20 --> 01:54:41.60
And this old guy is the wristlock master.

3129
01:54:41.60 --> 01:54:42.76
Can I tell your story for you?

3130
01:54:42.76 --> 01:54:43.36
Stop.

3131
01:54:43.36 --> 01:54:46.52
And then he taught me a couple wristlocks.

3132
01:54:46.52 --> 01:54:49.88
And then when I hurt my back, I couldn't do arm bars anymore.

3133
01:54:49.88 --> 01:54:52.76
So if you grab the arm, you got to spin all the way around.

3134
01:54:52.76 --> 01:54:54.48
Like Glover, you seem to grab some arm.

3135
01:54:54.48 --> 01:54:56.000
He's jumping around.

3136
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.84
I just, I focus on the wrist and elbow and I snap it.

3137
01:54:59.84 --> 01:55:02.28
And if it works, it works.

3138
01:55:02.28 --> 01:55:04.80
If it doesn't work, I use it to pass the guard.

3139
01:55:04.80 --> 01:55:07.80
You could see like Cade Ritolo, he used a wristlock.

3140
01:55:07.80 --> 01:55:09.36
And it's Mika Galvan.

3141
01:55:09.36 --> 01:55:11.04
He starts snapping his wrist.

3142
01:55:11.04 --> 01:55:12.44
You highlighted that.

3143
01:55:12.44 --> 01:55:14.36
Mika pulls out.

3144
01:55:14.36 --> 01:55:17.68
And then he starts coming around, circling,

3145
01:55:17.68 --> 01:55:19.56
goes back to the center, goes again.

3146
01:55:19.56 --> 01:55:23.60
Mika hides his wrist, gives him the pass, and he takes the leg.

3147
01:55:23.60 --> 01:55:24.92
And then he stuck his leg in.

3148
01:55:24.92 --> 01:55:27.84
And I only had these videos out for a couple of years.

3149
01:55:27.84 --> 01:55:30.32
Now mind you, I came out wristlocked the world

3150
01:55:30.32 --> 01:55:31.44
when I was living with Glover.

3151
01:55:31.44 --> 01:55:33.84
We're sitting over there in National City over here

3152
01:55:33.84 --> 01:55:35.60
working with you guys.

3153
01:55:35.60 --> 01:55:38.88
And I was so pissed, I was like, fuck the world.

3154
01:55:38.88 --> 01:55:41.24
I'm like, no.

3155
01:55:41.24 --> 01:55:43.08
Wristlocked the world.

3156
01:55:43.08 --> 01:55:44.56
Wristlocked, butting.

3157
01:55:47.48 --> 01:55:48.84
Like, yeah.

3158
01:55:48.84 --> 01:55:51.12
Glover's like, fuck you, Pete.

3159
01:55:51.12 --> 01:55:52.12
I need something like that.

3160
01:55:52.12 --> 01:55:54.16
Come up with something like that for me.

3161
01:55:54.16 --> 01:55:57.08
And then it just took off.

3162
01:55:57.08 --> 01:56:01.64
You know, I started WTW, stands for a lot of things.

3163
01:56:01.64 --> 01:56:06.000
PTG stands for past a guard, past a guac.

3164
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:06.92
Past a guard.

3165
01:56:06.92 --> 01:56:07.80
Pressure the guard.

3166
01:56:07.80 --> 01:56:09.24
Pressure the guard.

3167
01:56:09.24 --> 01:56:12.16
Pray to whomever you choose.

3168
01:56:12.16 --> 01:56:14.80
There's a lot of things.

3169
01:56:14.80 --> 01:56:17.40
And man, doing Jitsu at Glover is fun.

3170
01:56:17.40 --> 01:56:22.000
And I can honestly say, I don't have, like, you had Bill,

3171
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:22.80
or you had Dean.

3172
01:56:22.80 --> 01:56:23.52
I had Carlson.

3173
01:56:23.52 --> 01:56:24.76
He passed away.

3174
01:56:24.76 --> 01:56:26.88
So I was like, my guy is gone.

3175
01:56:26.88 --> 01:56:29.76
So thank God I end up in the best rooms with the best people

3176
01:56:29.76 --> 01:56:30.72
that love Jiu Jitsu.

3177
01:56:30.72 --> 01:56:34.96
And lately, I've been somehow ended up with the Rotolo

3178
01:56:34.96 --> 01:56:35.64
Brothers.

3179
01:56:35.64 --> 01:56:39.12
With them every day, we do this foundations training.

3180
01:56:39.12 --> 01:56:40.84
And then we do, like, spears like this.

3181
01:56:40.84 --> 01:56:43.24
And all this stuff is fixing them.

3182
01:56:43.24 --> 01:56:44.64
But I get to be around them.

3183
01:56:44.64 --> 01:56:45.84
So it's fixing me.

3184
01:56:45.84 --> 01:56:48.32
And the guys are, like, living in Hawaii,

3185
01:56:48.32 --> 01:56:50.48
where I got hurt initially.

3186
01:56:50.48 --> 01:56:52.56
And so it's all coming full circle.

3187
01:56:52.56 --> 01:56:56.24
And that's what's so cool about martial arts is,

3188
01:56:56.24 --> 01:56:57.40
comes around full circle.

3189
01:56:57.40 --> 01:57:00.12
Last time we were here, was there a Jocko podcast

3190
01:57:00.12 --> 01:57:01.52
when we were here years ago?

3191
01:57:01.52 --> 01:57:02.60
Like, I don't even know.

3192
01:57:02.60 --> 01:57:05.20
This has only been around for about six years?

3193
01:57:05.20 --> 01:57:06.000
Seven years?

3194
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.24
Seven years, yeah.

3195
01:57:07.24 --> 01:57:08.52
Which is weird.

3196
01:57:08.52 --> 01:57:10.44
So it's all coming full circle.

3197
01:57:10.44 --> 01:57:13.24
And I think the more you love Jiu Jitsu, the more it'll love you.

3198
01:57:13.24 --> 01:57:16.24
And Jeff and I have made how many videos?

3199
01:57:16.24 --> 01:57:18.92
I mean, like, I showed up to BJJ Fanatics.

3200
01:57:18.92 --> 01:57:20.80
I made Rislock the World.

3201
01:57:20.80 --> 01:57:23.12
Dana hers the one that actually got me that job.

3202
01:57:23.12 --> 01:57:26.20
Like, I don't know him so well, but he gets a kick out of me.

3203
01:57:26.20 --> 01:57:28.64
And they call me up, Bernardo called me up,

3204
01:57:28.64 --> 01:57:29.88
and I show up there.

3205
01:57:29.88 --> 01:57:33.60
And I seen they had a Jeff Glover DVD in their own collection.

3206
01:57:33.60 --> 01:57:35.68
It was with, like, another company.

3207
01:57:35.68 --> 01:57:37.48
I forgot their name.

3208
01:57:37.48 --> 01:57:39.20
I thought Pete was full of shit.

3209
01:57:39.20 --> 01:57:40.60
I was like, dude, Pete's full of shit.

3210
01:57:40.60 --> 01:57:42.32
I'm like, Glover, what am I supposed to do here?

3211
01:57:42.32 --> 01:57:43.32
I've been here like...

3212
01:57:43.32 --> 01:57:44.20
Full of shit about what?

3213
01:57:44.20 --> 01:57:45.24
Just everything he said.

3214
01:57:45.24 --> 01:57:47.84
I was like, this dude's just, he lies about all kinds of shit.

3215
01:57:47.84 --> 01:57:50.28
He always thinks I'm a scammer because he hasn't met, like,

3216
01:57:50.28 --> 01:57:51.64
I'm Sasain in Greek.

3217
01:57:51.64 --> 01:57:54.36
He's used to, like, Mexican, white...

3218
01:57:54.36 --> 01:57:55.80
And then met the owner of the company.

3219
01:57:55.80 --> 01:57:56.80
He met me before.

3220
01:57:56.80 --> 01:57:57.80
He thinks I'm a scammer.

3221
01:57:57.80 --> 01:57:58.80
Wait, this is BJJ Fanatics.

3222
01:57:58.80 --> 01:57:59.80
Yeah.

3223
01:57:59.80 --> 01:58:01.36
And when the guy, he was like, oh yeah, just passively.

3224
01:58:01.36 --> 01:58:04.000
He's like, yeah, Dean gets these bubble blood checks every month.

3225
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
I was like, what?

3226
01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.88
I'm like, Glover, get your ass over it.

3227
01:58:06.88 --> 01:58:09.56
He's like, fuck you, Pete, I'm not leaving San Diego.

3228
01:58:09.56 --> 01:58:11.04
Yeah, I was like, I don't want to go out there.

3229
01:58:11.04 --> 01:58:12.04
He's like, go back.

3230
01:58:12.04 --> 01:58:13.04
He's like, go to...

3231
01:58:13.04 --> 01:58:14.04
He's cold out there.

3232
01:58:14.04 --> 01:58:15.04
He's cold out there.

3233
01:58:15.04 --> 01:58:16.76
I'm like, all right, Glover.

3234
01:58:16.76 --> 01:58:18.72
And then I get out of there and shit, and then Glover always...

3235
01:58:18.72 --> 01:58:20.12
We always try to top each other.

3236
01:58:20.12 --> 01:58:21.12
That's what's really cool.

3237
01:58:21.12 --> 01:58:22.60
Like, so, like...

3238
01:58:22.60 --> 01:58:28.20
What we do is we hang out extremely a lot and then we disband and we try to like come

3239
01:58:28.20 --> 01:58:30.20
up with who can come up with more stuff.

3240
01:58:30.20 --> 01:58:32.28
But I got hurt before him.

3241
01:58:32.28 --> 01:58:37.56
So like the people are like, they got to really be into it to know me.

3242
01:58:37.56 --> 01:58:40.24
They got to pretty much be into it to know him.

3243
01:58:40.24 --> 01:58:42.44
They don't even got to be into it to know Joe Rogan.

3244
01:58:42.44 --> 01:58:44.80
Joe Rogan, like he's the one that probably like...

3245
01:58:44.80 --> 01:58:46.72
He's like the Scotty now.

3246
01:58:46.72 --> 01:58:47.72
He's like...

3247
01:58:47.72 --> 01:58:48.72
He's like...

3248
01:58:48.72 --> 01:58:50.04
You know what I mean?

3249
01:58:50.04 --> 01:58:53.32
The Scotty was like that for us as kids.

3250
01:58:53.32 --> 01:58:57.64
But now you got like Joe Rogan and we're all friends.

3251
01:58:57.64 --> 01:58:58.64
Eddie Bravo.

3252
01:58:58.64 --> 01:58:59.84
Eddie's our good friend.

3253
01:58:59.84 --> 01:59:01.76
Like, shoot, like...

3254
01:59:01.76 --> 01:59:03.40
He does the other half guard, you know?

3255
01:59:03.40 --> 01:59:05.28
What do they call him?

3256
01:59:05.28 --> 01:59:06.28
Lockdown.

3257
01:59:06.28 --> 01:59:09.16
So like Nemesis, Glover and Eddie.

3258
01:59:09.16 --> 01:59:10.72
They're kind of like...

3259
01:59:10.72 --> 01:59:12.32
They're from the same planet or something.

3260
01:59:12.32 --> 01:59:15.16
I don't know, but he's my other good buddy.

3261
01:59:15.16 --> 01:59:17.000
Shoot, he gets a kick out of it.

3262
01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.44
And we're all connected.

3263
01:59:18.44 --> 01:59:25.000
And Joe Rogan, hey, thanks a lot because every Jitsu school in the world should think that

3264
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000
guy.

3265
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
For sure.

3266
01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Period.

3267
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Right?

3268
01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Yeah, for sure.

3269
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Spreading the word.

3270
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.08
And Joey Diaz, I gave him that class.

3271
01:59:33.08 --> 01:59:34.08
Changed his life.

3272
01:59:34.08 --> 01:59:37.68
He put the video out and shout out to him too.

3273
01:59:37.68 --> 01:59:39.68
Because he's...

3274
01:59:39.68 --> 01:59:42.16
And he knows everything about martial arts, believe it or not.

3275
01:59:42.16 --> 01:59:43.76
He did Kung Fu and all that stuff.

3276
01:59:43.76 --> 01:59:45.92
And I looked at him and I said, you know what?

3277
01:59:45.92 --> 01:59:48.16
You need to get on the match, brother.

3278
01:59:48.16 --> 01:59:49.76
And I talked to him at least once a week.

3279
01:59:49.76 --> 01:59:53.36
Like when my mom was on hospice, we call up Joey.

3280
01:59:53.36 --> 01:59:54.36
He thinks he's really...

3281
01:59:54.36 --> 01:59:56.32
He's like, yeah, this is your uncle from your mom's side.

3282
01:59:56.32 --> 01:59:57.32
It's weird.

3283
01:59:57.32 --> 01:59:58.64
It's like we're really related.

3284
01:59:58.64 --> 02:00:00.60
And cool dude.

3285
02:00:00.60 --> 02:00:01.60
He loves Glover.

3286
02:00:01.60 --> 02:00:02.60
I know everyone is...

3287
02:00:02.60 --> 02:00:03.60
Yes or no?

3288
02:00:03.60 --> 02:00:07.80
Like dude, these guys call me...

3289
02:00:07.80 --> 02:00:08.80
Spit that shit, dude.

3290
02:00:08.80 --> 02:00:09.80
Look, my mom's sick.

3291
02:00:09.80 --> 02:00:11.96
My mom just passed away a few weeks ago.

3292
02:00:11.96 --> 02:00:15.80
Look, Eddie Bravo calls up every night, plays music for her.

3293
02:00:15.80 --> 02:00:16.80
Crazy.

3294
02:00:16.80 --> 02:00:17.80
That's awesome, man.

3295
02:00:17.80 --> 02:00:18.80
Eddie follows me up.

3296
02:00:18.80 --> 02:00:22.32
Do you guys remember the Eddie Bravo video that was Cribs?

3297
02:00:22.32 --> 02:00:25.16
Oh yeah, I'm in that video.

3298
02:00:25.16 --> 02:00:26.36
I tried to find it on...

3299
02:00:26.36 --> 02:00:27.96
It's not on YouTube.

3300
02:00:27.96 --> 02:00:29.64
But we got to get the access to that.

3301
02:00:29.64 --> 02:00:30.64
I got it at home.

3302
02:00:30.64 --> 02:00:31.64
It's called the Twister.

3303
02:00:31.64 --> 02:00:32.64
I'm on the Easter egg.

3304
02:00:32.64 --> 02:00:35.72
So if you go up, down, left, right, up, down, left, right, I show up.

3305
02:00:35.72 --> 02:00:37.48
Yeah, so it was on that DVD.

3306
02:00:37.48 --> 02:00:38.48
So that's why I have it.

3307
02:00:38.48 --> 02:00:39.48
So I must have it.

3308
02:00:39.48 --> 02:00:41.08
But I don't even have a DVD player anymore.

3309
02:00:41.08 --> 02:00:44.16
Yeah, there's a way you press up, down, left, right.

3310
02:00:44.16 --> 02:00:45.16
They're called Easter eggs.

3311
02:00:45.16 --> 02:00:48.48
Scotty's brother, Kate, who's like a computer genius.

3312
02:00:48.48 --> 02:00:49.48
This guy put it in there.

3313
02:00:49.48 --> 02:00:54.84
So when you put the little code in and I pop up and Eddie Bravo, yeah, he's...

3314
02:00:54.84 --> 02:00:56.88
Shoot, just a regular dude like us.

3315
02:00:56.88 --> 02:00:59.32
And then next thing you know, he's another one.

3316
02:00:59.32 --> 02:01:00.80
Like shoot, 10 planet.

3317
02:01:00.80 --> 02:01:01.80
They're everywhere.

3318
02:01:01.80 --> 02:01:02.80
Yeah.

3319
02:01:02.80 --> 02:01:03.80
They're nice to Glover and I.

3320
02:01:03.80 --> 02:01:07.68
Like we've been to how many 10 planet schools teaching seminars.

3321
02:01:07.68 --> 02:01:10.000
It's one thing that's cool.

3322
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.72
Back in the day, it seemed like there was more animosity.

3323
02:01:12.72 --> 02:01:18.24
And maybe there still is, but between Jiu Jitsu schools and all that stuff, it seems like

3324
02:01:18.24 --> 02:01:19.24
that's not so...

3325
02:01:19.24 --> 02:01:20.24
Definitely, what?

3326
02:01:20.24 --> 02:01:21.32
Let me say it doesn't even seem.

3327
02:01:21.32 --> 02:01:25.84
They're definitely not that as much animosity as there used to be between, or maybe it's

3328
02:01:25.84 --> 02:01:27.84
just between all the people we know.

3329
02:01:27.84 --> 02:01:28.84
We're in their systems.

3330
02:01:28.84 --> 02:01:31.20
You know, they have moves named after Glover.

3331
02:01:31.20 --> 02:01:32.52
They have wrist socks after me.

3332
02:01:32.52 --> 02:01:34.32
I'm sure they have moves.

3333
02:01:34.32 --> 02:01:38.36
When you're part of someone's system, there's no denying it.

3334
02:01:38.36 --> 02:01:43.20
Glover's got like, they have like moves and they have a system of moves.

3335
02:01:43.20 --> 02:01:47.64
Like they have like, how can you not be friends with your inner system?

3336
02:01:47.64 --> 02:01:48.64
Geez.

3337
02:01:48.64 --> 02:01:49.64
Well, right on.

3338
02:01:49.64 --> 02:01:54.40
So what, so if guys are looking to follow you guys now, I want to do a seminar.

3339
02:01:54.40 --> 02:01:57.60
How do they get to do a Jeff Glover seminar in their Academy?

3340
02:01:57.60 --> 02:02:00.12
I have the same booking agent that Dean has.

3341
02:02:00.12 --> 02:02:02.000
It's a guy named Dave Herbert.

3342
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:03.000
So where do they go?

3343
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Like is it a website?

3344
02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Striker's International.

3345
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.52
It's a, it's a, it's a, you know, booking agency where he does seminars for striking

3346
02:02:10.52 --> 02:02:12.04
people and whatever.

3347
02:02:12.04 --> 02:02:15.44
Dean came to my tournament, introduced me to the guy, bought a Bing, bought a Boom.

3348
02:02:15.44 --> 02:02:18.40
He's booking all of our seminars for us and making it easy.

3349
02:02:18.40 --> 02:02:23.04
So Striker's International on Instagram is the guy's page.

3350
02:02:23.04 --> 02:02:27.36
And or you could just contact me on Instagram and we can book seminars and flat rate and

3351
02:02:27.36 --> 02:02:28.36
all that stuff.

3352
02:02:28.36 --> 02:02:32.40
And your, and your Instagram is Jeff, Jeff Glover BJJ.

3353
02:02:32.40 --> 02:02:33.60
That's right.

3354
02:02:33.60 --> 02:02:37.96
You guys are both, you already mentioned this, BJJ Fanatics, which is a compilation website

3355
02:02:37.96 --> 02:02:43.72
of all the best guys in the world making videos, instructional videos.

3356
02:02:43.72 --> 02:02:44.88
Both you guys are on there.

3357
02:02:44.88 --> 02:02:46.44
We have a lot of content.

3358
02:02:46.44 --> 02:02:47.92
Most of the people have a couple of videos.

3359
02:02:47.92 --> 02:02:49.36
Jeff and I are there a lot.

3360
02:02:49.36 --> 02:02:54.64
Like we have between the both of us who made probably 40 videos in a past year and a half.

3361
02:02:54.64 --> 02:02:59.16
And I'm, I'm just, I just started working with Striker's International too.

3362
02:02:59.16 --> 02:03:01.44
So you could contact them or you could find us.

3363
02:03:01.44 --> 02:03:06.52
Do to remind me after this, let's talk to the boys at BJJ Fanatics and put like a special

3364
02:03:06.52 --> 02:03:07.88
on when this comes out.

3365
02:03:07.88 --> 02:03:08.88
You know what I'm saying?

3366
02:03:08.88 --> 02:03:13.32
So maybe people could buy like a, like 10 of your videos or something in a package or

3367
02:03:13.32 --> 02:03:14.32
something.

3368
02:03:14.32 --> 02:03:18.16
There's always like, even if you buy one video, every little bit helps, you know, Jeff and

3369
02:03:18.16 --> 02:03:20.60
I actually taught, we taught a lot of classes.

3370
02:03:20.60 --> 02:03:23.56
I remember we taught the, we taught the Marines together and stuff.

3371
02:03:23.56 --> 02:03:24.56
Yeah.

3372
02:03:24.56 --> 02:03:25.56
Joel Hoffman, remember?

3373
02:03:25.56 --> 02:03:26.56
Colonel Joel, you trained here?

3374
02:03:26.56 --> 02:03:27.56
Yeah.

3375
02:03:27.56 --> 02:03:28.56
So there's no discrimination.

3376
02:03:28.56 --> 02:03:29.96
We're here to teach, you know?

3377
02:03:29.96 --> 02:03:33.68
If you're watching this years from now on Instagram, maybe it doesn't even exist.

3378
02:03:33.68 --> 02:03:34.68
Who knows?

3379
02:03:34.68 --> 02:03:36.80
You can always find us Pete the Greek, you know what I mean?

3380
02:03:36.80 --> 02:03:40.000
Jiu-Jitsu and Jeff Glover, Jiu-Jitsu and Jocko.

3381
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.80
You could find us if you want us.

3382
02:03:41.80 --> 02:03:42.80
Echo to it only, Vecho.

3383
02:03:42.80 --> 02:03:43.80
He's a black belt.

3384
02:03:43.80 --> 02:03:44.80
He's a black belt.

3385
02:03:44.80 --> 02:03:45.80
All these guys, you know what I mean?

3386
02:03:45.80 --> 02:03:48.12
You're at Pete the Greek, wristlock the world.

3387
02:03:48.12 --> 02:03:49.72
Is that one big thing on Instagram?

3388
02:03:49.72 --> 02:03:51.12
Is it that whole thing or is it just Pete the Greek?

3389
02:03:51.12 --> 02:03:52.12
That whole thing.

3390
02:03:52.12 --> 02:03:53.12
Pete the Greek.

3391
02:03:53.12 --> 02:03:56.52
There's some other Pete the Greek guy that's kind of fake.

3392
02:03:56.52 --> 02:04:01.000
Your BJJ school is called RioBjj.com.

3393
02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.60
Let's see, what's the...

3394
02:04:03.60 --> 02:04:07.48
And that's also where you can get t-shirts or whatever.

3395
02:04:07.48 --> 02:04:09.16
Just go to wristlocktheworld.com.

3396
02:04:09.16 --> 02:04:10.16
I bought that one.

3397
02:04:10.16 --> 02:04:11.16
Oh, okay.

3398
02:04:11.16 --> 02:04:12.16
It brings you to everything.

3399
02:04:12.16 --> 02:04:13.16
I'm at Instagram.

3400
02:04:13.16 --> 02:04:14.16
wristlocktheworld.com.

3401
02:04:14.16 --> 02:04:17.36
I put a link tree so you can set up all your links.

3402
02:04:17.36 --> 02:04:22.000
And like I said, if Instagram's not around in the future, you can always find us.

3403
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.16
You know, we do Jiu-Jitsu.

3404
02:04:24.16 --> 02:04:28.32
You'll find Glover in the Greek.

3405
02:04:28.32 --> 02:04:29.32
Right on.

3406
02:04:29.32 --> 02:04:33.92
And the Ritola brothers, I want to give a shout out to them because my mom just passed away.

3407
02:04:33.92 --> 02:04:39.48
I was feeling down, Jeff all the way in Santa Barbara and these kids, like, I don't know,

3408
02:04:39.48 --> 02:04:42.60
I have a good connection with them.

3409
02:04:42.60 --> 02:04:47.16
And they're about the only ones as cool as watching Glover as far as I'm concerned.

3410
02:04:47.16 --> 02:04:49.92
Because most of the matches, I fall asleep.

3411
02:04:49.92 --> 02:04:51.44
And these guys, I get that.

3412
02:04:51.44 --> 02:04:53.64
They're the only ones that remind me of Glover.

3413
02:04:53.64 --> 02:04:57.56
I just want to add, when his mom died, I showed up.

3414
02:04:57.56 --> 02:04:58.56
No, Glover's great.

3415
02:04:58.56 --> 02:05:00.16
It sounded like I wasn't there, motherfucker.

3416
02:05:00.16 --> 02:05:01.16
I was there for that.

3417
02:05:01.16 --> 02:05:02.16
Okay.

3418
02:05:02.16 --> 02:05:03.16
Glover was in Santa Barbara.

3419
02:05:03.16 --> 02:05:04.92
I came to be with you.

3420
02:05:04.92 --> 02:05:05.92
No, my mom looked at me.

3421
02:05:05.92 --> 02:05:06.92
She goes, I'm tired of seeing.

3422
02:05:06.92 --> 02:05:07.92
I'm tired of seeing.

3423
02:05:07.92 --> 02:05:08.92
Is anyone listening?

3424
02:05:08.92 --> 02:05:09.92
Things I'm a bad friend.

3425
02:05:09.92 --> 02:05:10.92
That's not true.

3426
02:05:10.92 --> 02:05:11.92
My mom's a big mo.

3427
02:05:11.92 --> 02:05:12.92
She's from Chicago.

3428
02:05:12.92 --> 02:05:13.92
And my grandma's Leona.

3429
02:05:13.92 --> 02:05:15.44
These are all like pizza people.

3430
02:05:15.44 --> 02:05:20.04
My grandma's the first woman in Chicago to have a restaurant, a business.

3431
02:05:20.04 --> 02:05:22.88
So a shout out to Shaitown, dude.

3432
02:05:22.88 --> 02:05:23.88
Shout out.

3433
02:05:23.88 --> 02:05:25.44
You know what I mean?

3434
02:05:25.44 --> 02:05:26.44
Right on.

3435
02:05:26.44 --> 02:05:27.44
Awesome.

3436
02:05:27.44 --> 02:05:28.44
Echo, you got anything else?

3437
02:05:28.44 --> 02:05:29.44
Oh yeah, a couple things.

3438
02:05:29.44 --> 02:05:30.44
Sandy Beach.

3439
02:05:30.44 --> 02:05:31.44
That's real.

3440
02:05:31.44 --> 02:05:32.44
Sandy Beach is on a Wahoo though, by the way.

3441
02:05:32.44 --> 02:05:33.44
It's not in Hilo.

3442
02:05:33.44 --> 02:05:34.44
They might have taken me there.

3443
02:05:34.44 --> 02:05:35.44
They're on somewhere.

3444
02:05:35.44 --> 02:05:36.44
Hey, we're going to go.

3445
02:05:36.44 --> 02:05:37.44
We're going to go training.

3446
02:05:37.44 --> 02:05:38.44
Oh yeah.

3447
02:05:38.44 --> 02:05:42.44
So it's very notorious for the short break.

3448
02:05:42.44 --> 02:05:44.36
You Google break that beach.

3449
02:05:44.36 --> 02:05:45.88
Short pound, sure, if you will.

3450
02:05:45.88 --> 02:05:48.80
I'm saying in this scenario, it's probably appropriate to go to a short pound.

3451
02:05:48.80 --> 02:05:49.80
Oh yeah.

3452
02:05:49.80 --> 02:05:51.88
And it's super common for guys to get injured there.

3453
02:05:51.88 --> 02:05:54.60
So they post signs and all that stuff.

3454
02:05:54.60 --> 02:05:55.60
But you know.

3455
02:05:55.60 --> 02:05:56.60
P. degree, can't read no signs.

3456
02:05:56.60 --> 02:05:57.60
No way.

3457
02:05:57.60 --> 02:05:58.60
When you're going with the boys, they're going.

3458
02:05:58.60 --> 02:05:59.60
Yeah, the local guys, they don't.

3459
02:05:59.60 --> 02:06:02.16
Yeah, so you got to watch out though for that.

3460
02:06:02.16 --> 02:06:04.08
It's notorious for that kind of stuff.

3461
02:06:04.08 --> 02:06:05.08
Or the short break.

3462
02:06:05.08 --> 02:06:06.08
Yes.

3463
02:06:06.08 --> 02:06:07.08
Built my spirit.

3464
02:06:07.08 --> 02:06:08.96
Watch out for Sandy Beach.

3465
02:06:08.96 --> 02:06:09.96
Spirit.

3466
02:06:09.96 --> 02:06:15.64
Secondly, I think I figured out maybe 5, 10% of your whole thing.

3467
02:06:15.64 --> 02:06:16.64
Who?

3468
02:06:16.64 --> 02:06:17.64
Jeff Glover.

3469
02:06:17.64 --> 02:06:18.64
Jeff Glover.

3470
02:06:18.64 --> 02:06:19.64
Please inform us.

3471
02:06:19.64 --> 02:06:24.60
You like, you took the original structure, if you will, of Jujitsu and you were like,

3472
02:06:24.60 --> 02:06:27.48
oh wait, there's more stuff underneath the hood here.

3473
02:06:27.48 --> 02:06:31.80
So you just like, you know how you ever buy like a remote control car and be like, okay,

3474
02:06:31.80 --> 02:06:32.80
cool.

3475
02:06:32.80 --> 02:06:34.92
And you take it apart and you see the motor and you see how everything works.

3476
02:06:34.92 --> 02:06:38.68
You're like, okay, you take the original structure of Jujitsu and then when you roll,

3477
02:06:38.68 --> 02:06:40.04
you sort of take it apart.

3478
02:06:40.04 --> 02:06:41.80
Like you do stuff that you're not supposed to do.

3479
02:06:41.80 --> 02:06:42.80
You let them out.

3480
02:06:42.80 --> 02:06:43.80
Just see what happens.

3481
02:06:43.80 --> 02:06:44.80
See, let me take off this wheel.

3482
02:06:44.80 --> 02:06:46.76
Is that reverse engineering?

3483
02:06:46.76 --> 02:06:47.76
In a way.

3484
02:06:47.76 --> 02:06:52.16
But more and more, it's like a, it's a form of experimentation.

3485
02:06:52.16 --> 02:06:56.52
So it's like when you do that, you start to see little connections like, oh, this piece

3486
02:06:56.52 --> 02:06:58.04
doesn't have to fit here.

3487
02:06:58.04 --> 02:06:59.04
I dig it.

3488
02:06:59.04 --> 02:07:00.04
It can fit like over here.

3489
02:07:00.04 --> 02:07:01.04
I dig that.

3490
02:07:01.04 --> 02:07:04.64
And the reason we're one of the days that you're teaching and I figured that out is you did

3491
02:07:04.64 --> 02:07:06.76
this drill that I never been a part of before.

3492
02:07:06.76 --> 02:07:11.12
You're like, okay, get into whatever position mount, right?

3493
02:07:11.12 --> 02:07:14.72
And then you'll just call out another position or submission and you'll be like, get there

3494
02:07:14.72 --> 02:07:15.72
as quick as you can.

3495
02:07:15.72 --> 02:07:18.08
And some people would be like, Oh, I got to go here.

3496
02:07:18.08 --> 02:07:19.92
Some people, they don't even know how to get there.

3497
02:07:19.92 --> 02:07:25.12
They'll just sort of climb over and for which won't really work, but it's part of the drill.

3498
02:07:25.12 --> 02:07:27.20
You know, find the shortest path.

3499
02:07:27.20 --> 02:07:28.84
I was just going to say, you're right.

3500
02:07:28.84 --> 02:07:29.92
Find the shortest path.

3501
02:07:29.92 --> 02:07:35.20
But there's a test as a test to see who stumbles through that one and just, you know, makes

3502
02:07:35.20 --> 02:07:37.40
the 15 moves that could have been too.

3503
02:07:37.40 --> 02:07:41.000
But I felt it though, because when you were like, Oh yeah, I'm out.

3504
02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.000
We're in mount.

3505
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.44
And you said, go to the kneebar.

3506
02:07:43.44 --> 02:07:47.52
And I was like, I know the drill, so I'm not just going to just go to the kneebar.

3507
02:07:47.52 --> 02:07:49.40
Like the way you kind of can't really do it.

3508
02:07:49.40 --> 02:07:51.24
I got to go to another step first.

3509
02:07:51.24 --> 02:07:55.24
It's like, okay, I go half guard then the knee bar from, you know, Dean's knee bar or

3510
02:07:55.24 --> 02:07:56.24
whatever.

3511
02:07:56.24 --> 02:08:01.56
And I remember you watching and being like kind of looking as if just a little bit disgusting.

3512
02:08:01.56 --> 02:08:02.56
No, no, no.

3513
02:08:02.56 --> 02:08:03.56
The opposite.

3514
02:08:03.56 --> 02:08:04.56
It was kind of approved.

3515
02:08:04.56 --> 02:08:07.92
And not to say that that was such a great performance of the drill.

3516
02:08:07.92 --> 02:08:09.60
It was more like, this is how I felt.

3517
02:08:09.60 --> 02:08:10.60
I don't know.

3518
02:08:10.60 --> 02:08:11.60
I couldn't read his mind.

3519
02:08:11.60 --> 02:08:13.20
I just read his look where it was like.

3520
02:08:13.20 --> 02:08:17.44
The way I felt at that time was like, this is the purpose of this drill is to like, don't

3521
02:08:17.44 --> 02:08:20.16
think of it in terms of like, Oh, I know what an armbar is.

3522
02:08:20.16 --> 02:08:21.46
Let me just go there.

3523
02:08:21.46 --> 02:08:26.52
It's more like, figure out the quickest way and you'll probably figure out that there's

3524
02:08:26.52 --> 02:08:29.16
quicker ways than how you do it when you really roll.

3525
02:08:29.16 --> 02:08:34.12
Or there's actually ways to get there, even though it doesn't seem right there available

3526
02:08:34.12 --> 02:08:35.12
at the time.

3527
02:08:35.12 --> 02:08:36.12
It seems sane.

3528
02:08:36.12 --> 02:08:38.92
And then I started thinking back and not to say I did this all in one day or nothing

3529
02:08:38.92 --> 02:08:39.92
like that.

3530
02:08:39.92 --> 02:08:44.64
But when you think back to like a lot of your stuff, like you'll do a darts choke choke

3531
02:08:44.64 --> 02:08:46.60
when they're passing your guard.

3532
02:08:46.60 --> 02:08:49.68
And I'm like, Oh, that's not usually where they teach the darts choke.

3533
02:08:49.68 --> 02:08:50.68
Is it?

3534
02:08:50.68 --> 02:08:53.12
It's usually from a very specific, you know, number of positions.

3535
02:08:53.12 --> 02:08:58.16
And then if you look like his match against, um, this was in 2009.

3536
02:08:58.16 --> 02:09:01.48
It was you went against Joel first and then Bill the girl Cooper.

3537
02:09:01.48 --> 02:09:03.04
I forget who you went with first.

3538
02:09:03.04 --> 02:09:04.40
It was like one of the first.

3539
02:09:04.40 --> 02:09:05.40
No Martinez.

3540
02:09:05.40 --> 02:09:07.04
I think that was the day to.

3541
02:09:07.04 --> 02:09:11.08
Darts choke that guy, you know him, he's a good dude, but it was a random tournament

3542
02:09:11.08 --> 02:09:12.08
in Delmar.

3543
02:09:12.08 --> 02:09:13.08
Yeah.

3544
02:09:13.08 --> 02:09:17.72
And that was the first time I think I've seen you in real life and I was watching you do

3545
02:09:17.72 --> 02:09:18.72
stuff.

3546
02:09:18.72 --> 02:09:21.96
I was like, wait, he's like doing a lot of creative stuff.

3547
02:09:21.96 --> 02:09:25.72
Yeah, it's creative, but it's like you're violating a bunch of rules just so you can

3548
02:09:25.72 --> 02:09:28.92
implement something that works by the way.

3549
02:09:28.92 --> 02:09:32.36
And then when it's a good demonstration, the best demonstration of that, that I remember

3550
02:09:32.36 --> 02:09:35.12
is you against bill the girl when you guys were both doing it.

3551
02:09:35.12 --> 02:09:36.12
God.

3552
02:09:36.12 --> 02:09:41.20
And we closed out several pro events where we were like in the finals against each other.

3553
02:09:41.20 --> 02:09:42.20
Yeah.

3554
02:09:42.20 --> 02:09:45.32
And he's like, this is my little brother, you know, we would just like, let's, let's

3555
02:09:45.32 --> 02:09:46.96
put on a dope show.

3556
02:09:46.96 --> 02:09:50.76
Yes, it's going to be a fixed match, but it's going to be so cool that people don't mind

3557
02:09:50.76 --> 02:09:51.76
watching a fixed.

3558
02:09:51.76 --> 02:09:52.76
Oh yeah.

3559
02:09:52.76 --> 02:09:53.76
It was, yeah, it was crazy.

3560
02:09:53.76 --> 02:09:54.76
It was really.

3561
02:09:54.76 --> 02:09:58.84
Yeah, just like, uh, it's like why I talk about like musicians and how a musician that's

3562
02:09:58.84 --> 02:10:05.52
really like Jimmy Page, you know, he played like as a studio musician for, for decades,

3563
02:10:05.52 --> 02:10:09.16
like as a, as like a teenager, he was playing as a studio musician, like play these exact

3564
02:10:09.16 --> 02:10:10.40
notes at this exact time.

3565
02:10:10.40 --> 02:10:14.80
And he's so got so disciplined and so good that when he got to Led Zeppelin, he's like,

3566
02:10:14.80 --> 02:10:19.60
oh, watch this, I'm going to play a note here with a freaking violin thing, whatever

3567
02:10:19.60 --> 02:10:20.96
that thing is called.

3568
02:10:20.96 --> 02:10:23.84
And I'm going to start playing a guitar in a totally different way and it's going to

3569
02:10:23.84 --> 02:10:25.64
work and it's going to sound awesome.

3570
02:10:25.64 --> 02:10:26.64
That's to me.

3571
02:10:26.64 --> 02:10:27.88
That's like Jeff Glover on the mats of justice.

3572
02:10:27.88 --> 02:10:29.96
I got compared to Led Zeppelin.

3573
02:10:29.96 --> 02:10:30.96
Yeah.

3574
02:10:30.96 --> 02:10:31.96
Yeah, you did.

3575
02:10:31.96 --> 02:10:34.36
Right on, fellas.

3576
02:10:34.36 --> 02:10:35.64
You guys coming down.

3577
02:10:35.64 --> 02:10:38.24
I'm looking forward to taking classes after dude.

3578
02:10:38.24 --> 02:10:39.84
Yeah, that's all I got.

3579
02:10:39.84 --> 02:10:40.84
Yeah.

3580
02:10:40.84 --> 02:10:41.84
Thanks, fellas.

3581
02:10:41.84 --> 02:10:42.84
Thank you boys.

3582
02:10:42.84 --> 02:10:44.20
We out.

3583
02:10:44.20 --> 02:10:50.40
And with that, Jeff Glover and Pete, the Greek have left the building.

3584
02:10:50.40 --> 02:10:51.80
Little jujitsu talk today.

3585
02:10:51.80 --> 02:10:52.80
Yeah.

3586
02:10:52.80 --> 02:10:59.92
Uh, you know, for me, from my perspective, it was kind of interesting to be like last

3587
02:10:59.92 --> 02:11:05.48
night thinking I was going to do this podcast talking about jujitsu with Jeffy and Pete.

3588
02:11:05.48 --> 02:11:09.44
And it was kind of, it's kind of, it's a lot different, right?

3589
02:11:09.44 --> 02:11:14.64
A lot of times I'm reading from a book or I'm, you know, we're talking to someone that's

3590
02:11:14.64 --> 02:11:23.12
been through some horrific things and it's usually pretty heavy, emotionally heavy.

3591
02:11:23.12 --> 02:11:29.84
So it was kind of, I must say, it was kind of relaxing to come in and just be like, oh,

3592
02:11:29.84 --> 02:11:34.48
we're going to talk about jujitsu with, with Jeff and Pete, who are both, you know, like

3593
02:11:34.48 --> 02:11:36.16
nice and chill.

3594
02:11:36.16 --> 02:11:38.36
So there you go.

3595
02:11:38.36 --> 02:11:40.44
Uh, jujitsu jujitsu.

3596
02:11:40.44 --> 02:11:47.68
So my, I came in this jujitsu scene in 2005 and which was in kind of the beginning of

3597
02:11:47.68 --> 02:11:51.000
the height of ju, of Jeff Glover.

3598
02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:55.52
So I saw Bill the grill, Jeff Glover, like these guys or whatever.

3599
02:11:55.52 --> 02:11:59.48
So it is interesting to hear like his version of that timeline.

3600
02:11:59.48 --> 02:12:03.36
And so I was like, Oh, that's when, that's when I came on the scene grapplers quest,

3601
02:12:03.36 --> 02:12:10.84
best of the West, freaking the world submission grappling championships.

3602
02:12:10.84 --> 02:12:12.92
It was like grapplers quest.

3603
02:12:12.92 --> 02:12:18.32
You were a little behind when there used to be, God, there used to be some really interesting

3604
02:12:18.32 --> 02:12:20.60
tournaments, good tournaments.

3605
02:12:20.60 --> 02:12:23.96
But yeah, sounds like there's a, there's a series of tournaments that the tournaments

3606
02:12:23.96 --> 02:12:26.84
you're talking came after.

3607
02:12:26.84 --> 02:12:32.12
There was like, what was that one, like the Olympics of grappling or something like this

3608
02:12:32.12 --> 02:12:34.56
grappling games.

3609
02:12:34.56 --> 02:12:40.32
So I think that one faded by the time there was a place in LA called neutral grounds.

3610
02:12:40.32 --> 02:12:42.000
That was old school back in the day.

3611
02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:46.96
I mean, we're talking like there'd be 50 people there in a cage, like with a grappling matches,

3612
02:12:46.96 --> 02:12:49.96
we're in a cage.

3613
02:12:49.96 --> 02:12:54.84
Dean Lister had a tournament or a match against a guy there and Dean got him in some kind

3614
02:12:54.84 --> 02:13:01.40
of hold, some kind of choke hold, but like, Oh no, Rico Rodriguez got this guy, but the

3615
02:13:01.40 --> 02:13:03.92
guy didn't tap.

3616
02:13:03.92 --> 02:13:09.68
And he like, when the ref stopped it or whatever, the dude like didn't get up for a while.

3617
02:13:09.68 --> 02:13:12.40
Like they were thinking this guy might not be alive.

3618
02:13:12.40 --> 02:13:18.32
Yeah, there were some crazy stuff, but a little bit rogue back in those days.

3619
02:13:18.32 --> 02:13:19.32
Yeah.

3620
02:13:19.32 --> 02:13:21.28
It's crazy how different it is now.

3621
02:13:21.28 --> 02:13:28.60
It is the popularity of Jiu Jitsu is awesome to see and Jiu Jitsu is fun.

3622
02:13:28.60 --> 02:13:32.96
And that the way that Jeff Glover rolls makes it even more fun watching him roll.

3623
02:13:32.96 --> 02:13:33.96
Yeah.

3624
02:13:33.96 --> 02:13:34.96
Get fun.

3625
02:13:34.96 --> 02:13:35.96
Yeah.

3626
02:13:35.96 --> 02:13:42.24
He's like the ideal of like exploratory to do and then what you gain like when you are

3627
02:13:42.24 --> 02:13:47.60
I mean, him as the example, like what he has gained from exploring Jiu Jitsu in that way.

3628
02:13:47.60 --> 02:13:53.04
So much is that's what makes it so like, you're not used to that kind of stuff.

3629
02:13:53.04 --> 02:13:58.60
And so it comes off as so amazing and it's available to most people like that, but it's

3630
02:13:58.60 --> 02:14:03.80
hard to like get in that mindset because he does it straight up during competitions.

3631
02:14:03.80 --> 02:14:05.44
Like watch like MetaMorris.

3632
02:14:05.44 --> 02:14:07.72
I think it was like four secret match.

3633
02:14:07.72 --> 02:14:08.72
Oh yeah.

3634
02:14:08.72 --> 02:14:12.76
He's the announcer, by the way, you know, like a secret match and it's Barry Yoshida,

3635
02:14:12.76 --> 02:14:16.44
who just wasn't the hall of fame of ADCC, by the way.

3636
02:14:16.44 --> 02:14:17.84
Barry Yoshida versus somebody.

3637
02:14:17.84 --> 02:14:18.84
It's a secret, right?

3638
02:14:18.84 --> 02:14:19.84
It's like a surprise.

3639
02:14:19.84 --> 02:14:25.52
And they're like, Jeff Glover, the announcer gets off, takes off his suit and goes rolls.

3640
02:14:25.52 --> 02:14:31.40
And boom, exploratory Jiu Jitsu, Donkey Guard, all this unorthodox stuff, but it's like,

3641
02:14:31.40 --> 02:14:33.76
it's by design, you know?

3642
02:14:33.76 --> 02:14:37.92
And it's interesting too, because they're like, they live kind of for lack of a better

3643
02:14:37.92 --> 02:14:39.92
term like a Jiu Jitsu nomad style, right?

3644
02:14:39.92 --> 02:14:41.96
Where they go around, everyone knows them.

3645
02:14:41.96 --> 02:14:42.96
They know everybody.

3646
02:14:42.96 --> 02:14:46.36
Is that Kang and Kung Fu walking the earth?

3647
02:14:46.36 --> 02:14:52.24
It's crazy that for like five years, I have victory MMA and fitness.

3648
02:14:52.24 --> 02:14:56.12
Look, we have Dean Lister teaching, like, which is insane just to think you can learn

3649
02:14:56.12 --> 02:14:59.12
all this stuff from Dean Lisch.

3650
02:14:59.12 --> 02:15:03.96
But for five years, we had Dean Lisch, which is as good as it's going to get.

3651
02:15:03.96 --> 02:15:06.68
And Jeff Glover, they're both here.

3652
02:15:06.68 --> 02:15:07.68
It was crazy.

3653
02:15:07.68 --> 02:15:10.80
It was like every day was just, it was crazy.

3654
02:15:10.80 --> 02:15:12.20
It was epic.

3655
02:15:12.20 --> 02:15:16.64
Sometimes I rolled with Jeff and I've rolled in many, many times.

3656
02:15:16.64 --> 02:15:21.88
And so the thing I remember about, or the thing that makes this very memorable is this

3657
02:15:21.88 --> 02:15:22.88
was the whole day I rolled with him.

3658
02:15:22.88 --> 02:15:27.80
I got a bunch of times where we're rolling, he's being all, he's keeping it playful or

3659
02:15:27.80 --> 02:15:28.80
whatever.

3660
02:15:28.80 --> 02:15:31.000
And then he switched and kept it real.

3661
02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.08
Cause if you didn't know, there's two, two modes, keeping it playful and keeping it real.

3662
02:15:35.08 --> 02:15:37.04
That's Hannah and he don't grace me up those terms, by the way.

3663
02:15:37.04 --> 02:15:42.36
He, he, he switches over to keeping it real and bust out some wrestling on me.

3664
02:15:42.36 --> 02:15:44.88
And I don't mean on me cause I'm so good.

3665
02:15:44.88 --> 02:15:48.32
And so that's why I'm not saying that I'm saying because I outweighed him by a lot and

3666
02:15:48.32 --> 02:15:50.20
he just put it on me.

3667
02:15:50.20 --> 02:15:53.36
Another notable thing is earlier.

3668
02:15:53.36 --> 02:15:54.36
Okay.

3669
02:15:54.36 --> 02:15:57.68
So I like Kimura, especially on smaller guys.

3670
02:15:57.68 --> 02:15:59.64
He saw the Kimura coming.

3671
02:15:59.64 --> 02:16:03.40
He gave me the Kimura and he reached behind his back and just held his arms as if to be

3672
02:16:03.40 --> 02:16:06.52
like, I'm giving you this Kimura, but it's your job to finish it.

3673
02:16:06.52 --> 02:16:07.52
I couldn't finish it.

3674
02:16:07.52 --> 02:16:11.28
I was like, bro, see that's the, and it's not like I'm smaller than him where it's like

3675
02:16:11.28 --> 02:16:12.28
I'm bigger.

3676
02:16:12.28 --> 02:16:15.20
Like the, the, the chance of me finishing it is going to be higher than, you know, maybe

3677
02:16:15.20 --> 02:16:20.12
a smaller guy still does it, but that's that exploratory process that's going to allow

3678
02:16:20.12 --> 02:16:23.64
him to understand all his available maneuver maneuvers.

3679
02:16:23.64 --> 02:16:26.80
When your hand is already behind your back.

3680
02:16:26.80 --> 02:16:29.96
He has that, we talked about it, but that level of confidence, like an insane level

3681
02:16:29.96 --> 02:16:30.96
of confidence in duty.

3682
02:16:30.96 --> 02:16:35.36
You know, when you watch Dean Lister with footlocks, he has that specifically with

3683
02:16:35.36 --> 02:16:36.60
footlocks at hill.

3684
02:16:36.60 --> 02:16:40.16
There's been tournaments where Dean would like stick his feet out like, go ahead, please

3685
02:16:40.16 --> 02:16:41.88
try and footlock me.

3686
02:16:41.88 --> 02:16:46.92
But man to Glover has that from a positional attitude.

3687
02:16:46.92 --> 02:16:49.16
Like he doesn't care what position someone gets.

3688
02:16:49.16 --> 02:16:50.52
He's going to.

3689
02:16:50.52 --> 02:16:53.08
So awesome stuff.

3690
02:16:53.08 --> 02:16:54.84
Thanks for those guys for coming on.

3691
02:16:54.84 --> 02:16:57.04
Support the podcast.

3692
02:16:57.04 --> 02:16:58.04
You want to support the podcast?

3693
02:16:58.04 --> 02:16:59.04
You got to support yourself.

3694
02:16:59.04 --> 02:17:01.16
Hopefully you're going to start training Jiu-Jitsu.

3695
02:17:01.16 --> 02:17:05.08
We can't even start to, you can't even start to explain how much Jiu-Jitsu is going to

3696
02:17:05.08 --> 02:17:07.000
help you in your life.

3697
02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:12.44
You got to, you got to, you got to say, listen, I, you got to have faith in what we're saying.

3698
02:17:12.44 --> 02:17:13.44
Right.

3699
02:17:13.44 --> 02:17:14.44
Cause I can't explain it.

3700
02:17:14.44 --> 02:17:16.16
Echo can't explain it.

3701
02:17:16.16 --> 02:17:18.64
You got to have a little bit of faith just to go try it.

3702
02:17:18.64 --> 02:17:22.44
And my recommendation is you do Jiu-Jitsu until you submit someone.

3703
02:17:22.44 --> 02:17:24.60
That's the, I made that, I did make that up.

3704
02:17:24.60 --> 02:17:26.16
I'll take credit for it.

3705
02:17:26.16 --> 02:17:28.32
You do Jiu-Jitsu until you submit someone.

3706
02:17:28.32 --> 02:17:31.92
Once you submit someone, if you decide, oh, I don't like this, did you move on?

3707
02:17:31.92 --> 02:17:32.92
That's probably not going to happen.

3708
02:17:32.92 --> 02:17:36.24
Cause once you submit somebody, you're like, it's like a drug.

3709
02:17:36.24 --> 02:17:37.24
Yeah.

3710
02:17:37.24 --> 02:17:38.24
Right.

3711
02:17:38.24 --> 02:17:41.20
And you know what else is like a drug if you have the right attitude is getting submitted

3712
02:17:41.20 --> 02:17:43.60
is like, damn, how'd that happen?

3713
02:17:43.60 --> 02:17:44.60
How'd that happen?

3714
02:17:44.60 --> 02:17:47.36
You know, it's a, it can be a horrible thing.

3715
02:17:47.36 --> 02:17:48.36
But start training Jiu-Jitsu.

3716
02:17:48.36 --> 02:17:51.96
If you're going to do Jiu-Jitsu, you're going to need to fuel that Jiu-Jitsu.

3717
02:17:51.96 --> 02:17:56.96
Get yourself some Jocofuel clean fuel, clean energy, good for you.

3718
02:17:56.96 --> 02:17:59.20
Making stuff that's literally good for you.

3719
02:17:59.20 --> 02:18:00.72
Go to jocofuel.com.

3720
02:18:00.72 --> 02:18:01.72
You can get these drinks.

3721
02:18:01.72 --> 02:18:03.88
God, they're good.

3722
02:18:03.88 --> 02:18:04.88
You can get these drinks.

3723
02:18:04.88 --> 02:18:11.28
We, if you tried the drinks like six months ago, the jocogo drinks, you may not like the

3724
02:18:11.28 --> 02:18:12.28
taste.

3725
02:18:12.28 --> 02:18:18.08
You might have been like, but we, because of that, because that feedback, we reformulated

3726
02:18:18.08 --> 02:18:22.80
the flavors and now they freaking taste delicious.

3727
02:18:22.80 --> 02:18:24.04
So that's that.

3728
02:18:24.04 --> 02:18:26.40
Mulk, you probably just are down with that one.

3729
02:18:26.40 --> 02:18:27.88
If you're drinking, you're drinking.

3730
02:18:27.88 --> 02:18:32.60
I mean, Mulk is a savior to your, to your body.

3731
02:18:32.60 --> 02:18:34.000
It's a savior to your body.

3732
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.12
It's going to, you get that Mulk hitter.

3733
02:18:37.12 --> 02:18:45.96
It's also a mental savior because you just got done eating a, eating a wagyu ribeye.

3734
02:18:45.96 --> 02:18:46.96
You know what I'm saying?

3735
02:18:46.96 --> 02:18:49.28
Like this is top of top dog.

3736
02:18:49.28 --> 02:18:50.28
Yep.

3737
02:18:50.28 --> 02:18:51.28
Right.

3738
02:18:51.28 --> 02:18:55.72
You just get done eating a, just a beautiful ribeye, even though it was delicious.

3739
02:18:55.72 --> 02:18:56.72
You still get done.

3740
02:18:56.72 --> 02:19:00.64
So you can have a little, you can have a little, you can have a little something sweet.

3741
02:19:00.64 --> 02:19:01.64
Sure.

3742
02:19:01.64 --> 02:19:02.64
It's possible.

3743
02:19:02.64 --> 02:19:03.64
It's possible.

3744
02:19:03.64 --> 02:19:04.86
So that's where you got that Mulk train.

3745
02:19:04.86 --> 02:19:05.86
Get on the Mulk.

It's an emergency scenario.

3759
02:19:30.88 --> 02:19:32.48
Boom, ready to drink.

Also if you're doing jiu-jitsu,

02:19:42.48 --> 02:19:44.56
you're gonna need a jiu-jitsu gi.

3766
02:19:44.56 --> 02:19:46.16
Gi, no gi.

3767
02:19:46.16 --> 02:19:47.52

All the stuff's made in America.

3772
02:19:53.16 --> 02:19:55.44
Hunt gear, done, out.

3773
02:19:56.72 --> 02:20:00.88
Jeans, boots.

3774
02:20:00.88 --> 02:20:03.52
I mean, this is what you need to live.

3775
02:20:03.52 --> 02:20:05.52
You need a gi.

3776
02:20:05.52 --> 02:20:08.08
You need jiu-jitsu shorts and rash guard.

3777
02:20:08.08 --> 02:20:09.12
You need jeans.

3778
02:20:09.12 --> 02:20:10.60
You need a t-shirt and you need a hoodie.

3779
02:20:10.60 --> 02:20:11.76
We got you covered.

3780
02:20:11.76 --> 02:20:12.60
You need boots.

3781
02:20:12.60 --> 02:20:13.92
We got you covered.

3782
02:20:13.92 --> 02:20:16.70
Originusa.com and this stuff is made in America

3783
02:20:16.70 --> 02:20:20.000
which is the critical,

3784
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:21.80
the critical part of this.

3785
02:20:21.80 --> 02:20:23.12
Because there's companies out there right now

3786
02:20:23.12 --> 02:20:24.12
that are gonna try to sell you something.

3787
02:20:24.12 --> 02:20:26.48
They got a brand, right?

3788
02:20:26.48 --> 02:20:27.76
They got a brand.

3789
02:20:27.76 --> 02:20:28.60
Making a brand.

3790
02:20:28.60 --> 02:20:30.56
Oh, our brand is whatever.

3791
02:20:30.56 --> 02:20:32.76
And what they do is they come up with some ideas

3792
02:20:32.76 --> 02:20:34.92
and they design it and there's four people working there,

3793
02:20:34.92 --> 02:20:36.96
seven people working there.

3794
02:20:36.96 --> 02:20:37.80
And you know what?

3795
02:20:37.80 --> 02:20:42.68
They design it and then they order it from China.

3796
02:20:42.68 --> 02:20:43.92
And then over in a sweatshop,

3797
02:20:43.92 --> 02:20:46.64
some slave labor makes it, sends it to here.

3798
02:20:46.64 --> 02:20:50.08
They sell it and they keep that money and they go,

3799
02:20:50.08 --> 02:20:51.12
cool, we made money.

3800
02:20:51.12 --> 02:20:52.80
Let's do it again.

3801
02:20:52.80 --> 02:20:53.82
That's not what we're doing.

3802
02:20:53.82 --> 02:20:55.50
We're making it in America.

3803
02:20:55.50 --> 02:20:57.80
So we do design it.

3804
02:20:57.80 --> 02:21:00.52
But then we bring the designs to the factory.

3805
02:21:00.52 --> 02:21:04.40
Our factories here in Maine and North Carolina

3806
02:21:04.40 --> 02:21:05.84
and we make it.

3807
02:21:05.84 --> 02:21:08.68
Americans make this stuff.

3808
02:21:09.88 --> 02:21:12.92
And you'd think all it must be seven times more expensive

3809
02:21:12.92 --> 02:21:14.36
than the slave labor.

3810
02:21:14.36 --> 02:21:16.16
No, it's not.

3811
02:21:16.16 --> 02:21:17.000
It's not.

3812
02:21:17.92 --> 02:21:20.88
And you're investing in America.

3813
02:21:20.88 --> 02:21:23.04
So originUSA.com, go get some.

3814
02:21:23.04 --> 02:21:24.32

Also, Jockel's Store is called Jockel's Store.

3817
02:21:27.36 --> 02:21:29.24
So we can get discipline equals freedom stuff,

3818
02:21:29.24 --> 02:21:30.60
T-shirts and hats and hoodies.

3819
02:21:30.60 --> 02:21:32.52
Merch, if you will, a little bit better quality

3820
02:21:32.52 --> 02:21:35.44

3821
02:21:36.72 --> 02:21:37.88
Also, we got the shirt locker,

3822
02:21:37.88 --> 02:21:41.04
which is a new shirt, new shirt design every month.

3823
02:21:41.04 --> 02:21:43.04
They're good, they're creative, they're fun.

3824
02:21:43.04 --> 02:21:44.68
Some controversial.

3825
02:21:44.68 --> 02:21:46.48
Yeah, there's been some controversial ones.

3826
02:21:46.48 --> 02:21:47.32
Some controversy.

3827
02:21:47.32 --> 02:21:49.84
But the ones I come up with seem to be more controversial

3828
02:21:49.84 --> 02:21:50.68
in a way.

3829
02:21:50.68 --> 02:21:53.12
Yeah, my specific designs.

3830
02:21:53.12 --> 02:21:54.92
Yeah, well, you're a controversial,

Who knows?

3850
02:22:25.76 --> 02:22:29.60
Maybe they don't like people from Chicago named Pete

3851
02:22:29.60 --> 02:22:30.44
the Greek and they're like,

3852
02:22:30.44 --> 02:22:32.24

We're on Twitter.

3914
02:24:58.20 --> 02:25:00.44
I've been getting a little bit back into Twitter

3915
02:25:00.44 --> 02:25:05.32
since it seems like it might be picked up by Elon Musk,

3916
02:25:05.32 --> 02:25:07.68
who may or may be probably going to do a better job

3917
02:25:07.68 --> 02:25:09.92
of not censoring people,

3918
02:25:09.92 --> 02:25:12.84
which makes you kind of question the whole gig.

3919
02:25:13.96 --> 02:25:17.24
So Twitter, the Graham, Facebook,

3920
02:25:17.24 --> 02:25:18.40
we're on there, Echoes at Echo, Charles,

3921
02:25:18.40 --> 02:25:20.04
I'm at Jocko'willing.

3922
02:25:20.04 --> 02:25:23.08
Of course, you got to watch out for that algorithm,

3923
02:25:23.08 --> 02:25:24.40
because it will catch you.

3924
02:25:24.40 --> 02:25:26.000
And the reason I know it'll catch you

3925
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:31.000
is because what I cheat when I go in my ice bath,

3926
02:25:31.40 --> 02:25:33.76
kind of cheat when I go in my ice bath,

3927
02:25:33.76 --> 02:25:38.28
I will look at the Instagram or some social media

3928
02:25:38.28 --> 02:25:40.04
when I'm in there and time just goes by.

3929
02:25:40.04 --> 02:25:41.12
You're like, oh, it's been six minutes,

3930
02:25:41.12 --> 02:25:42.000
how did that happen?

3931
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.72
Oh, because my brain was captured.

3932
02:25:43.72 --> 02:25:45.16
Yeah, yeah, sedated.

3933
02:25:45.16 --> 02:25:47.24
So that's a good rule of thumb.

3934
02:25:47.24 --> 02:25:50.000
You can only look at social media

3935
02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.48
when you're in some uncomfortable scenario,

3936
02:25:52.48 --> 02:25:55.24
but get into a wall squat.

3937
02:25:55.24 --> 02:25:57.52
And as long as you can hold it, you can scroll.

3938
02:25:57.52 --> 02:25:58.36
Yeah.

3939
02:25:58.36 --> 02:25:59.76
You know, you get seven minutes, cool.

3940
02:25:59.76 --> 02:26:01.40
You know what I'm saying?

3941
02:26:01.40 --> 02:26:04.16
Go, could you hang off a pull-up bar?

3942
02:26:04.16 --> 02:26:05.96
No, because you need your hand to scroll.

3943
02:26:05.96 --> 02:26:06.96
Maybe you could.

3944
02:26:06.96 --> 02:26:09.28
What other, what's another crappy position to get in?

3945
02:26:09.28 --> 02:26:11.28
Ice bath for sure.

3946
02:26:11.28 --> 02:26:12.32
Talking to you.

3947
02:26:12.32 --> 02:26:13.76
Ice bath, yeah, you could sit there

3948
02:26:13.76 --> 02:26:15.04
and have to talk to me.

3949
02:26:15.04 --> 02:26:16.56
You a little frustrated today?

3950
02:26:17.40 --> 02:26:19.000
What was the frustration about?

3951
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.04
I wasn't frustrated today.

3952
02:26:20.04 --> 02:26:20.88
No, no, no, I can tell.

3953
02:26:20.88 --> 02:26:21.70
That was yesterday.

3954
02:26:21.70 --> 02:26:22.68
No, you were roid raging.

3955
02:26:22.68 --> 02:26:24.68
I wasn't roid raging today, that was yesterday.

3956
02:26:24.68 --> 02:26:26.20
Hoi.

3957
02:26:26.20 --> 02:26:28.20
Cause you took it upon yourself to interrupt me

3958
02:26:28.20 --> 02:26:29.64
in the morning, by the way.

3959
02:26:29.64 --> 02:26:33.68
In the middle of my workout with some nonsense.

3960
02:26:33.68 --> 02:26:37.04
But you responded during a workout.

3961
02:26:37.04 --> 02:26:37.88
Yeah, that's true.

3962
02:26:37.88 --> 02:26:38.72
Is that a good move you think?

3963
02:26:38.72 --> 02:26:41.32
No, no, I know now, yeah, no.

3964
02:26:41.32 --> 02:26:42.52
Bad move, terrible.

3965
02:26:42.52 --> 02:26:45.20
What was the trigger statement that I made?

3966
02:26:45.20 --> 02:26:47.36
No, no, I'd have to go through the thread,

3967
02:26:47.36 --> 02:26:48.96
but there, cause there was a few.

3968
02:26:52.04 --> 02:26:53.36
Multiple.

3969
02:26:53.36 --> 02:26:55.20
So I made multiple comments that I did.

3970
02:26:55.20 --> 02:26:57.40
Multiple, well, yeah, it's true, true story.

3971
02:26:57.40 --> 02:26:58.80
Then you have to come here and sit here

3972
02:26:58.80 --> 02:27:01.80
and talk to me for a long period of time.

3973
02:27:01.80 --> 02:27:03.80
So I should have been scrolling social media

3974
02:27:03.80 --> 02:27:05.12
during that time.

3975
02:27:05.12 --> 02:27:06.32
It's mental anguish.

3976
02:27:06.32 --> 02:27:07.16
Yep.

3977
02:27:07.16 --> 02:27:10.92
Ha ha, check.

3978
02:27:10.92 --> 02:27:12.72
All right, well, watch out for that algorithm

3979
02:27:12.72 --> 02:27:15.16
unless I'm verbally abusing you,

3980
02:27:15.16 --> 02:27:16.32
then it could be a nice little escape.

3981
02:27:16.32 --> 02:27:17.16
See, that's what you need.

3982
02:27:17.16 --> 02:27:21.66
You need a little escape from my abusive personality,

3983
02:27:21.66 --> 02:27:22.76
you know, apparently.

3984
02:27:22.76 --> 02:27:24.24
The world makes sense.

3985
02:27:24.24 --> 02:27:25.84
You're going to train after this?

3986
02:27:25.84 --> 02:27:27.92
I don't know, 50, 50.

3987
02:27:27.92 --> 02:27:31.28
I have another engagement that I have.

3988
02:27:31.28 --> 02:27:32.40
You knew we were doing this today.

3989
02:27:32.40 --> 02:27:33.84
Yeah, I have my clothes, everything.

3990
02:27:33.84 --> 02:27:35.08
Okay.

3991
02:27:35.08 --> 02:27:35.92
All right.

3992
02:27:35.92 --> 02:27:38.36
Okay, well, hey, that's on, you know,

3993
02:27:38.36 --> 02:27:39.92
that's on the world, you know?

3994
02:27:39.92 --> 02:27:41.000
Guess it's not your fault.

3995
02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.20
See your whole tone right now.

3996
02:27:42.20 --> 02:27:43.68
Yeah, see, that's what that's it.

3997
02:27:43.68 --> 02:27:44.68
This is part of what I'm talking about.

3998
02:27:44.68 --> 02:27:45.52
That's the abusive.

3999
02:27:45.52 --> 02:27:46.36
It's part of it.

4000
02:27:46.36 --> 02:27:48.000
It's part of it, yeah, it is, yes.

4001
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:48.92
Check.

4002
02:27:48.92 --> 02:27:51.28
All right, well, once again,

4003
02:27:51.28 --> 02:27:52.92
thanks to Jeff and Pete for coming down.

4004
02:27:52.92 --> 02:27:56.36
Thanks for what you guys have done for Jiu-Jitsu.

4005
02:27:56.36 --> 02:27:58.16
Oh, we stoked to have you all around.

4006
02:27:58.16 --> 02:28:00.60
And thanks for helping so many people out

4007
02:28:00.60 --> 02:28:02.72
by giving them the gift.

4008
02:28:02.72 --> 02:28:05.16
And it is a gift of Jiu-Jitsu.

4009
02:28:05.16 --> 02:28:06.000
So thanks, fellas.

4010
02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.92
And I also want to thank our service members

4011
02:28:08.96 --> 02:28:13.12
from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard.

4012
02:28:14.04 --> 02:28:19.04
We get to train Jiu-Jitsu because you all protect us.

4013
02:28:19.28 --> 02:28:21.68
And by the way, all of you in the service,

4014
02:28:21.68 --> 02:28:22.76
if you get a chance,

4015
02:28:24.08 --> 02:28:25.80
and actually you should make a chance,

4016
02:28:25.80 --> 02:28:27.96
go find a way to train Jiu-Jitsu.

4017
02:28:27.96 --> 02:28:30.36
It's going to help you in everything that you do.

4018
02:28:30.36 --> 02:28:33.56
Same goes for the rest of our police and law enforcement

4019
02:28:33.56 --> 02:28:35.68
and firefighters and paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

4020

correctional, officers, border patrol, secret service,

4021
02:28:39.80 --> 02:28:41.64
all first responders.

4022
02:28:41.64 --> 02:28:44.52
Thanks for protecting us and keeping us safe

4023
02:28:44.52 --> 02:28:46.48
so that we can live our lives.

4024
02:28:46.48 --> 02:28:48.84
And same thing, guess what?

4025
02:28:48.84 --> 02:28:53.72
Please, please go out and start training Jiu-Jitsu

4026
02:28:53.72 --> 02:28:54.96
if you don't already.

4027
02:28:54.96 --> 02:28:58.04
It can save your life.

4028
02:28:58.04 --> 02:28:59.64
And everyone else out there,

4029
02:28:59.64 --> 02:29:00.72
guess what I'm going to say?

4030
02:29:00.72 --> 02:29:02.44
The same thing.

4031
02:29:02.44 --> 02:29:04.40
If you're training Jiu-Jitsu right now, cool.

4032
02:29:04.40 --> 02:29:05.24
Keep training.

4033
02:29:05.24 --> 02:29:09.04
And if you're not, go find a Jiu-Jitsu Academy

4034
02:29:09.04 --> 02:29:11.80
and go train Jiu-Jitsu.

4035
02:29:11.80 --> 02:29:29.48
And until next time, the ZECO and JAKO, out.
