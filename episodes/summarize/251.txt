and that's that's that's that's a that's awesome 101 more stuff I stole from hack hack with 101 several adjuncts to morale chart three good management we all like to be in a unit where things run smoothly where things are planned where men do not have to hurry up and wait adequate information men like to be kept informed ahead of time of things that affect them or are act to affect them it is far better to for the commander to keep his men informed that have the men seek to get such information from rumors high state of training if a unit is not well trained it's men know it this fact shakes their confidence especially if they anticipate the possibility of using that training in a critical situation chances for advancement progress is morale raising to all men knowing that advancement is possible and that excellent performance and preparation lead to promotion helps morale good physical and mental condition good physical condition goes hand in hand with good mental condition these two elements are basic to achieving good morale good administration men like to know that they're paying accounts and individual records are correct confidence and equipment are is the best equipment best equipment army in the world confidence and commanders men expect their commanders to know their jobs to share the hardships with them and to take a personal interest in their problems you will not know whether a particular officer or soldier has a problem until someone has heard his case a willing ear will gain much confidence comfortable quarters I'm paraphrasing some of these mess good food mail service medical attention post exchange facilities leaves and passes religious services and character guidance it is especially important that a army be made up of mostly young soldiers be provided with facilities for religious services in accordance with their preferences a program of character guidance will help to continue in the service the whole some influence of home and community life awards and letters of commendation standards soldiers like to be in a sharp unit they appreciate achievement of high standards in discipline dress house keeping police maintenance training and athletics but lifting morale that comes from impressive and well executed military ceremonies is an important factor that can remind you like group heaties you know and the team and everyone like hates group heaties like crumbles like our group group heaties but if you don't know that it can be a problem back to the book so morale must be high enough to stand the shock and the boredom of combat every man must be strong must strongly believe that what he is doing is right he must have supreme confidence that he can deal with any situation that he is a better fighter than the enemy a spree decor is unit morale every man must feel that his unit is a superb fighting unit and that he like the rest will sacrifice even life itself for the unit the spirit is often the difference between mediocre and superior armies it was strong in the robin legions and the French troops under Napoleon recognize though that the commander must inspire beyond the group a spree only deep personal conviction springing from the identification with a cause will drive a man forward when his unit is destroyed or scattered personal example the commander should be a model soldier he must master the technique of war as it fits his assignment he must improve and expand his technical knowledge the commander must strive to make it possible for every soldier to say truthfully the old man knows the old man always knows the right thing to do in addition he must exhibit daily a fine example of stamina and courage besides his own example the higher commander is also represented by his staff officers they too must reflect the superior qualities of their commander above all set the proper example leading by example there you go the model soldier soldiers morale show me a unit that is well run properly trained and ready for combat and I'll show you a unit with high morale no commander will readily admit that his units morale is anything other than next I wrote the leadership strategy in tax people is asking how do I improve do hard things you unimproven morale do hard things as we compare units however it is often obvious that morale in some units is more excellent than in others what is morale our manual on leadership defines morale is the mental and emotional state of the individual although it is a complex and intangible quality the manifestations of its absence in a unit can be detected readily in the form of poor appearance of the individuals of the individuals and unit area poor discipline and a low state of training that's something I mean obviously a high worth immediately applied that you know to the the hard from the hard luck to the hardcore for Italian and I was thinking about that with task and bruiser something that we talk about often which is you know the initially we were working hard than everybody you know people were working hard than we were preparing for scenarios that we the guys had been to Iraq previously like what why are we training for this crazy multi-cash little scenario you know that we we didn't experience anything like that on the on the battlefield or when the instructors say hey you guys are good to go hey we're so focused on ourselves I'm focused on how tired I am I don't know how tired this guy is all I have really is his external what he's doing or looking like but if the other guy's just like cruising in his face like he's really comfortable you're like man I can't compete with this at all so now you want to give up even more you can never like the joke about normal face is no joke man it really isn't it really truly isn't and you talk about you talk about you know like when how many times have you seen me like we're doing jujitsu or even not you training with me but me training with anybody me training with Dean Lish you know training with somebody that's better than me that's given me a run have you ever seen like a look on my face of just like despair and we went bought you a big like Danny slam burger you know like double cheese burger like we're gonna go let's go see jokbo you just had a surgery and we roll up there and you were just and you were like normal I knew you were hurt back as you did like like just set it down over there like you were still like normal face and I don't know what you looked like before we walked in there and he's telling his corner caught him off he's done caught my gloves off I'm done and basically his corners like you got you know you got to keep going and they look over the other guy didn't answer the bell so like that's that's where it's at like if you you can give up right there that's something to think about you know like can you just go a little bit more can you just go a little bit more back to the book in combat you really see the critical importance of high morale and a speed of core morale must be high enough to stand the shock and boredom of combat you know actually before I continue here I want to say this that thing about giving people heads up about what they're going to face like that you or we lost a a kick 13 which is you know cryptologic device that you know that we use for radios it's a cryptological device that when you lose means the entire country of America has to update their cryptological modes which is a giant deal and so for Jocco to just give you the normal face on that it's actually the worst it's like your dad telling you he's he's uh he's not angry he's just disappointed I mean it's actually the worst because if you were like dude are you kidding me you know like I would look at it it would be desirable which I was like Roger and just looks back at you like it's like angry doesn't it give you like a you know you're gonna make whatever $5,000 this month you know what I know you like to get after it and go have a good time and you should and you should do that with $4,000 not with $4,999 so if you're in a position where you can help people plan their economic future please do that you know what it's funny that you're actually saying that because you of all the people I worked with in 13 years in the Navy like you're the only one that did that and maybe not on like a you didn't like have a presentation to the entire task unit you know maybe you could have done something absolutely should have no I maybe it's on the other side of like your brain or something but doesn't it give you like a big sense of comfort like okay at least this is manageable like it's a big deal but at least it's manageable because like if you're already kind of freaking out for whatever reason and you bring it to him who's like part of the reason you're kind of apprehensive about the whole thing to say the least and he doesn't freak out so it's like it feels like in your mind you're like but the fact that he's saying look you're not bringing people in there to preach on how to do things you're bringing in their educate to have discussions and he's got the whole topic of discussions here military courtesy personal standards military discipline promotions unit history a speed of core accomplishments missions troop information morale self education of officers professional publications responsibility for fun he's got everything security classification use a misuse of military vehicles so basically it's like tell the guys what's going on that's what he's saying you have to tell people what's going on and then he's got this commander's checklist for success and this we've already been going for a while so this will probably be the last thing we cover every commander at every echelon should maintain a continuing checklist to be left for or given to his successor to command this checklist should contain items of value that will assist the new commander in becoming familiar with his command more rapidly than if he had had to uncover the same items over a period of time such items must consist of one significant strengths and weaknesses of key officers and non-commission officers in the command boom isn't it weird that we might be in charge of people and know that we would have to turn this over and not keep track of like who's what strengthen weaknesses are next important policy matters announced by senior commanders and not contained in SOP or directives so you're tracking this stuff a good turnover is such an important thing to to do and what I think is important about a turnover it's great to have it to turn over to the next unit but what it does is it forces you to actually think through how you are operating and when you force yourself to think through how you're operating you define it you refine it you codify it right so he's out there I actually owe him copies of about face of this new version but guess what I'll some sending him a RCs of extreme ownership because they gave us about six each I have all of mine I have mine as well you want to know why why do you have yours why did you keep yours I think I some of my intended to send to people and they didn't get sent and some of my just thought be kind of cool to get hang on to you know I only kept I first of all I didn't know that it was a big deal I didn't know that this is this whole thing you know we didn't know if the hell we are doing when it came to writing so we didn't know if the hell we were doing so they send us these things and I'm like that's legit all right back to the book chart number four evidence of we're on this whole thing talking about morale and this is evidence of morale and discussing the subject of morale with visitors I often ask and am asked what do you look for in a unit or in order to gauge the morale since morale is influenced by so many factors there are naturally many indications of the state of morale the things I know quickly and sizing up a unit include I'm gonna burn through some of these saluting dress good house keeping pride pride I'll go into that one a little bit are the men eager to show their accomplishments do they point to their units history with pride do they have something good to sell and try and sell it participating in charities athletic program and support teams and athletic program enthusiastically supporters always a favorable indication of morale church attendance soldiers deposits and other savings a man who saves his money each month is banking on his future and his wellage it is usually a well adjusted and confident soldier when there are many such soldiers in a unit there is a depth of stability in the organization but commanders should not attempt to coerce the men to participate in this program you know just for for for all leaders really this is probably one of the things when I look back at my military career that I did a pretty horrible job of and that was that I never said all guys here's what you should do with your money here's some here's some moves to make you know here's some things that you should do here some things that you shouldn't do so just if you're a leader especially if you're a military leader look when you're a militant a lot of kids that joined the military myself included hey when I got to the teams and I was an E4 in the teams I was the richest person in the world and you know I got that paycheck every two weeks and you know it's funny people like say it to me like you're all in either one or two ways one is like you know I kind of like this sour apple sniper like they kind of ashamed to tell me and then the other ones like sour apple sniper is way better but it's we kind of like to think oh it's harder for me and without the recognition of like man this is it's hard for everybody and if I can push a little bit harder it's gonna give me the advantage I figured that out in hell week for me I wasn't the fastest runner I wasn't a fastest swimmer but like by like day two of hell week everyone is crushed I was like dude I'm good to go like all cool got it in a way I got it in a way being like overly tired driving could then again I don't know could be worse if it's because people were sick of the wheel because you can't control it you get the point where you can control it with like being drunk because it's you know it's facing sometimes when people are drunk behind the wheel they get like more daring and aggressive so they'll you know it's less that but that that's an awesome thing man and that's powerful I mean you and I were just talking about this today right with some some uh with Ashlong front stuff and and uh and our strategic growth and and things that I was really spinning up about and and really stressing on you're like it's not that big of a deal you know and that is that's something that is uh that perspective you know what someone's immersed it or it's someone is immersed in the details of things and they're like it's the way it's bearing down on them or like man this is gonna happen it's really easy to get stressed out about that hey you know whether even it's just something stupid like I'm thinking of some dump stuff like a you lost some gear right some let's say some critical gear which you did or your platoon did which means you did like like you know you come to me all right cool Roger you know as opposed to being like I can't believe you did that because now you can be like god jack was such a jerk and it's almost like you know we can have a little spatio as opposed to me just late just saddling you with unbearable guilt for letting me down but it's it's the reality is it's gets the problem fixed it gives the problem fixed I mean with it's not unbearable guilt it's like you're you're gonna like I would be I was feeling literally like physically claustrophobic because of how tired I was like empathetically getting from watching you guys and like how your arms were whatever else like man I don't know how he he can even take that or whatever I you know it's a learning process you know you learn about you know you learn about control in your emotions life I've learned a lot about parenting I feel like with the kids practicing or taking opportunities to practice normal face 100% of the time is a good method it's a good method and it is a great thing like no joke it is a great thing for a leader to be able to control your emotions because your emotions we already talked about this if I'm panicking if lay for a porch to me some news you know you're going to like if you I've had fighters where they're they got their first big they're on the big stage maybe they're in the UFC for the first time or whatever they get nervous and they don't know what that is no one ever told them hey man you're gonna feel you know you're gonna feel sick you're gonna feel butterflies T do or T is you know you know when you have a unit turning over thing like people coming in like get these idiots out of here we're going to take take over even though we've been there for six months learning and I was like man how are you going to learn from us to continue the mission to be more effective if we don't tell you what we screwed up but clearly he wasn't used to that and most people weren't doing that and I think that taking deeply about it and if you care about the mission then you want you want the people it is successful and and I actually you've got to kind of be honest with where if that's the goal like for real goal you know to work out every day that is a good thing as opposed to you know like I'm going to try to work out this week you know there's a difference is what I'm saying Dave we got got like going on with Ashland front work with leaders all the time you know as we talk about it just been phenomenal watch them particularly through this tough times of you know some some economic turmoil through COVID lockdowns and and unrest across riots across America etc like it's been it's been awesome to see companies taking apply those principles and so we've got got some great stuff going on Ashland front I think particularly if you think about decades from now what that might be like I a friend of mine showed me you know obviously that stuff becomes quite valuable to collectors and people that know you know it's meaningful to people that it has the understand the value of what it is and how rare it is and a friend of mine showed me a copy of it was a biography of Stonewall Jackson and he was like he handed it to me it was kind of his old and kind of brittle You know if I if I like I've got to pretend like I know it all and like no everyone knows you don't know at all. So you know what, I don't think you can actually use the word steel because they're freely given in the same way that like, when people are like, hey, do you mind if we like talk about it's remodership with our team like, no. I know you just we got stuff coming from flip time you guess uh we've got uh we got good check and uh we've got this one equals freedom we got all kinds of we got default aggressive Grandha and we've got a bunch of posters as well of the mustard and a vashlan front you know and back with troopers you mean you didn't get a poster that had like an outstretched hand on the cliff and another hand going to it yeah that was like barely like right when pictures to the internet started going like not all phone dead cameras so bottom line we got to pay attention the influence on morale from outside our organization pay attention to it this next section is called junior officers conferences and and it says there are always many newly commissioned officers find officers in the army they have come from many sources some of these young officers have demonstrated outstanding ability and combat others have not had this experience few of them have had the time or opportunity become fully indoctrinated with the duties and responsibilities required of an officer the standards and responsibilities of an officer are in many respects more exacting and more difficult to discharge in peace time than in combat consequently officers conferences should be conducted for all junior officers to review the duties and response response so what do you say is that look you should meet with your your subordinate leadership and educate them and teach them and I often ask this question to clients I say as anyone here had a person that invested in them personally maybe I don't know suggestions on how we can get you now that you mention it actually I think that's the interesting you're that book that you finally located it was like a little treasure hunt you know the kind guys who like they look for treasure that might not even exist you know that can go that that was you and you're just like kind of like that's what you do every day kind of think that's like I don't know that's what I knew is like yeah there's that I will say this there's something in the universe where sometimes you know how you're like if your bluetooth on your phone just randomly syncs up at your car and like if my kind of darkest or lowest moments like it seems to like sync up and just random these select and see what we're doing and see what it's like down here and see what it's like to live down here and let them understand what's going on in the front lines and I absolutely adopted that policy and what's cool is what he says in this book is you know why are you afraid of being inspected you shouldn't have nothing to hide so if you're if you're afraid of being inspected that's a problem and let's fix the thing so that you could be open to being inspected you know we we talked about that in extro membership right leading up the chenic command and how we invited our commander to come down and see what we're doing and and invite our operations officer and the there staff to be there but that's it's a complete opposite though of what everybody else I don't come from the background of giving things in in the in the on the scale of gift giveers like tacos you know 10 is greatest one is the least um tacos like 02 Jamie covered move caucran sent like my sent my oldest daughter flowers for her birthday whatever a year ago or something like that from me and my daughter did not even remotely believe it for one second and it's something that's really not gonna have a massive impact strategically so like I gotta do a better job of going oh you know let me know if something's a struggle where have I done this before like hey if it's gonna cost this would be really cool to have it'd be really cool if we executed this You're you mentioned like training and the kids and stuff the whole reason it's called normal face is because it's an actual game that this guy plays played whatever with the kids with the it's like a one at the wrapping paper the wrapping paper left over from the wrapping paper the the tube I've witnessed the normal face you know I did it to one we had a guy that showed up in Ramadha a new guy who's a great dude when he showed up and he's a happy guy and he had and he would smile all the time right we're talking private pile you know you know your job is to make things happen you know get default of the grass you have you haven't listed out all the way fire team leader you know take your four guys lead your fire team support your squad leader you had the squad leader then you had the butoon commanders you had the assault chief you had the you know assault force commander the ground force commander etc and that was a really powerful document so much so that I've had several several very successful seals including good friends of years who have reached out to me and said hey can we get a copy of that no no that was more of my that was my takeaway that's how it's regarding this book the whole time like that's your little treasure that you found finally after your journey you know I wonder what's gonna happen now like once this comes out is is stack pole books gonna reassure it or is jockel publishing somebody's gonna dig their like grandfather's copy out and there's gonna be nine of one the internet all by seven hundred fifty books and I think it like task in a bruiser I was like I thought we were pretty good in my first task in it until we were in bruiser and like actually weren't that good task in bruiser better and the rift is definitely like that girl and It doesn't offer a different answer, but I've seen leaders back into a corner where you know, like you know, late screwed something up and whatever the mitigating circumstances were, you know, I say you know what though, late it's I got a punishment. but if we can don't worry about it you know don't invest more than x amount of hours hey go look at it for two hours if we can't do it you know we won't do it no factor it'd be cool if we can but let's not let's not lose sleep over it whereas you know it's like once again going back to get his burg what I need to remember is if if generally tell Stonewall Jackson to do something he's gonna freaking do it and he doesn't care what price he has to pay to accomplish that mission well if I if I mentioned to you everybody else's mindset was like get the boss man away we don't want them around here we want to be able to and what they wanted to be able to get away with was like really minuscule stuff like uniforms around the camp like attendance at meetings a little things that don't really matter I mean I've known them since they all are super little and watching growing up and you have helped them you know train them and that like like help they're you're practicing that and it's something that you got to practice it something you have to you can get better with reps even if you're not naturally good at it like me you can definitely get better with with reps and but I guess to your point ago it's you're gonna I'm gonna actually fix that problem I want to make sure it doesn't happen again whether if you do if you flip that about it and you know yelled and screamed to me then that's my punishment whereas the punishment for me is knowing like it's constructive because I know like I kind of get the specs we can't let this happen again this is a massive issue You know like that little thing the best example or man there it is and the best example I can think of is we'd wrote about in the planning chapter of of extrem ownership which you know me and everyone knows this jock over about the launch on that hostage rescue operation and me and you're sitting in there and and butters are you know Intel and since it comes rolling I mean you know when we when we got into position and I got security set like I tried to take her down for an hour you know just to try to get a get some shut eye while I could while I was dark before the sun came out we knew we were going to get it on as we got attacked but life requires that you're going to have some sleep this night and it's freaking cool to sit there and go back because I'll go back and look at a book that I you know I had to cover on the podcast and like I didn't even come close to getting like out everything out of this that I need to get out of this you know with the old breed especially the early podcast where we would not they weren't as long and and now I look at I go and and yet what we gained by having them come out and visit us was a deep understanding of our mission how we were mitigating risk what resources we needed I mean it's it's it's a no brainer and yet nobody does that because they don't want the the scooby of the big boss man the wrong attitude next section outside influence on morale the factors and indications of morale covered so far concern things generally within the control of the commander but there are influences on the morale of the soldiers especially those on duty in a far off land which stem from apt attitudes of officials the press radio commentators and public at home the soldier should feel that he is needed and that his sacrifices are the of immediate and long range benefit to his country his home his family and himself he should feel that his unit is in is as important to him as his family that he is just as important to the unit he will feel that importance as long as the people at home feel that he is sensitive to public opinion at home and because of good radio newspaper and male facilities is constantly aware of attitudes at the home toward the importance of his job that's an interesting perspective compared to totally all enough if we were reading newspapers and watching TV you know the particular 2006 the rack war it was just constant negative coverage quagmire we can't win you know this is terrible we just had a tune that stuff out I just I just didn't take them for like three or four days you know because you were like laid up and whatever not really laid up but just just like I got I got off your routine yeah those posters at flipside canvas we do not sell those posters we sell posters that that can only be described with one word legit the posters are legit and Dakota and Mandy on the team are awesome awesome work with we got some books about face first edition with the forward by me which is just freaking an honor to be able to do we got the code the evaluation the protocol leadership strategy and tactics field manual warrior kid way the warrior kid one two and three by the way way the warrior kid four you can preorder it right now it's called way of the warrior do you know what the name of the new way the warrior kid is you might know but he understood what it was now imagine you you just going in your first fight and all the sudden you start you want to throw up and someone just be like hey just go ahead and throw up just get it out you know just get it out of your system it's the same thing in combat you gotta say hey listen you're nervous it's okay if you're jittery if you if you feel sick if you whatever it's okay that's just your body you know focus in its energy towards where it needs to be focused it's perfectly fine
