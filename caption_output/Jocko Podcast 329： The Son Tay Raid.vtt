00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Jockel podcast number 329 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing good evening echo good evening

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.64
At 1800 the bull and Lieutenant Colonel Sidner walked on the stage

3
00:00:15.96 --> 00:00:19.16
The room got dead silent when the bull began to talk

4
00:00:20.68 --> 00:00:22.68
Bull was a man of few words

5
00:00:23.64 --> 00:00:27.000
The briefing theater was a short walk from our barracks

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.72
Inside it had simple rows of wood seating like two by ten boards on short metal poles no seat backs

7
00:00:36.72 --> 00:00:38.72
It would seat around a hundred

8
00:00:39.44 --> 00:00:41.96
There was an elevated stage with a screen

9
00:00:42.64 --> 00:00:45.64
We'd watch to movie there just a couple days prior

10
00:00:47.48 --> 00:00:50.48
Bull reveals a large map and

11
00:00:51.16 --> 00:00:53.16
Says quote

12
00:00:53.16 --> 00:01:00.16
We are going to rescue 70 American prisoners of war maybe more from a camp called Sonté

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.56
The target is 23 miles west of Hanoi

14
00:01:04.68 --> 00:01:10.28
This is something our American prisoners of war have a right to expect from their fellow soldiers

15
00:01:11.64 --> 00:01:18.84
We are all part of the same military family. We want these men to know that they are not abandoned by their military family

16
00:01:18.84 --> 00:01:20.84
No man should feel that way

17
00:01:20.84 --> 00:01:25.000
That's why we are going in there after them

18
00:01:26.52 --> 00:01:30.44
You are to let nothing nothing interfere with the operation

19
00:01:31.16 --> 00:01:35.20
Our mission is to rescue prisoners not to take prisoners

20
00:01:36.52 --> 00:01:38.52
If there's been a leak

21
00:01:38.52 --> 00:01:41.88
We'll know it by the time the second or third chopper sets down

22
00:01:42.44 --> 00:01:46.28
If we're walking into a trap if it turns out that they know we're coming

23
00:01:46.68 --> 00:01:49.40
Don't even dream about walking out of North Vietnam

24
00:01:49.40 --> 00:01:51.88
Unless you've got wings on your feet

25
00:01:53.48 --> 00:01:55.48
We'll be a hundred miles from Louss

26
00:01:57.08 --> 00:02:00.04
It's the wrong part of the world for retrograde maneuver

27
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.64
If it happens, I want to keep this force together

28
00:02:05.80 --> 00:02:10.28
We'll back up to the Sonté Kong River if we have to and by God

29
00:02:10.28 --> 00:02:12.92
They're welcome to come across that damn open ground

30
00:02:12.92 --> 00:02:21.000
We'll make them pay for every foot across that Sonté for about four seconds

31
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You could have heard a pin drop

32
00:02:23.80 --> 00:02:26.20
Then like a cannon shot

33
00:02:26.20 --> 00:02:31.32
Everyone bursts out shouting, woooping, hollering, slapping each other on the back

34
00:02:31.32 --> 00:02:34.36
Raring like Broncos yelling, let's go get them

35
00:02:36.20 --> 00:02:40.52
Both tries to bring us back to Earth by explaining in no uncertain terms

36
00:02:40.52 --> 00:02:45.88
That he estimates each man has a 50-50 chance of returning alive from this mission

37
00:02:47.16 --> 00:02:50.20
He states that this is strictly a volunteer mission

38
00:02:51.40 --> 00:02:55.64
If any man has a reason that he should not go on this mission, he should decide now

39
00:02:57.80 --> 00:02:59.80
Not a single man backed out

40
00:02:59.80 --> 00:03:07.56
The whole meeting, including Lieutenant Colonel Sidner's portion lasted no longer than ten minutes

41
00:03:12.92 --> 00:03:16.92
And that right there is an excerpt from a book called

42
00:03:17.64 --> 00:03:26.44
Who will go into the Sonté POW camp written by Terry Buckler and is about one of the most famous

43
00:03:26.44 --> 00:03:35.64
Special Operations missions of all time the attempted POW rescue on the Sonté prison camp in Vietnam

44
00:03:37.96 --> 00:03:43.000
And the author Terry Buckler a special forces soldier green beret

45
00:03:44.36 --> 00:03:46.36
Was on that raid

46
00:03:46.68 --> 00:03:49.16
He was actually the youngest man on that mission

47
00:03:49.16 --> 00:03:56.12
And we have the honor of having him here with us tonight to share some of his lessons learned

48
00:03:56.76 --> 00:03:59.16
From this incredible mission and from his life

49
00:04:00.28 --> 00:04:01.48
Terry

50
00:04:01.48 --> 00:04:03.000
Thank you for joining us

51
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.04
All right pleasure

52
00:04:04.04 --> 00:04:08.28
It's an honor to have you here. This is something that I've heard about for many many years

53
00:04:08.28 --> 00:04:14.36
And anyone that's in the special operations community knows about this raid and the impact that it had

54
00:04:15.24 --> 00:04:17.24
Not just on the POWs

55
00:04:17.24 --> 00:04:25.48
But also in in the history and the continued evolution of special operations as a whole so it's

56
00:04:26.60 --> 00:04:31.24
Pretty pretty humbling to be sitting here talking to you that that you were actually all in that raid

57
00:04:32.76 --> 00:04:38.20
How do you end up coming on this podcast? Is your daughter my daughter she's acting like my agent

58
00:04:39.80 --> 00:04:45.96
And told me about you and I started looking up some of your podcast that you've done

59
00:04:45.96 --> 00:04:47.96
And

60
00:04:47.96 --> 00:04:51.88
And then started looking at your file and my goodness you're better than Trump

61
00:04:52.76 --> 00:04:54.76
So I don't know about all that

62
00:04:56.12 --> 00:05:06.04
That she's the one who got the ball rolling for it. Well, I'm definitely glad she she reached out and this just an incredible story

63
00:05:06.36 --> 00:05:08.36
The had an awesome time reading this book

64
00:05:09.64 --> 00:05:14.04
And we'll go over some of this book today. I'll start off by saying obviously I can't read the whole book

65
00:05:14.04 --> 00:05:19.16
Um get the book yourself if you want to hear the entire story, but I want to hit some wave tops of it

66
00:05:19.64 --> 00:05:21.64
Because it's just an incredible story and

67
00:05:23.40 --> 00:05:26.92
Well, usually like to start off in the beginning kind of where you came from and

68
00:05:27.88 --> 00:05:30.68
To introduce those topics. I'll go to the book

69
00:05:31.24 --> 00:05:37.32
Okay, so it says here. I was born in a two bedroom house on a small 72 acre farm in central Missouri in 1950

70
00:05:37.32 --> 00:05:43.08
We were six miles from Clark six from Renek and six from Higbee

71
00:05:43.88 --> 00:05:48.76
Our mail came through Clark. I went to school at Renek and our phone came through Higbee

72
00:05:49.56 --> 00:05:54.20
Clark happens to be the birth birthplace of famous World War II general Omar Bradley

73
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.64
Our house had been built in 1870

74
00:05:58.12 --> 00:06:03.40
We didn't have indoor plumbing until 1962 when I was 12

75
00:06:03.40 --> 00:06:06.68
So that's a

76
00:06:07.08 --> 00:06:10.12
That's a little different that people grow up now, huh? Just a little bit

77
00:06:13.32 --> 00:06:17.16
What tell me a little bit more about you know growing up in that in those conditions?

78
00:06:18.04 --> 00:06:22.84
Well, you know we were by ourselves our neighbors were in the same boat that we were pretty much

79
00:06:22.84 --> 00:06:27.80
We had one neighbor down the road that actually had indoor plumbing and as always kind of nice

80
00:06:27.80 --> 00:06:34.12
There are three kids and one of them was same ages maybe we grew up together and

81
00:06:34.92 --> 00:06:42.52
You know, sometimes we'd spend night to that each other's house and there's always nice to go to his house because you get a bath and hot water

82
00:06:43.80 --> 00:06:48.20
And so what you guys did you boil water to go and take a bath at your house sometimes

83
00:06:48.52 --> 00:06:53.16
Sometimes we boil water other times we set a tub out in the sun in the summer

84
00:06:53.16 --> 00:07:00.92
Okay, and then we'd bring it in the house and all the stories when I was growing up in my parents

85
00:07:00.92 --> 00:07:03.32
I'm going to town and I was taking a bath and

86
00:07:04.36 --> 00:07:09.000
We had a stove and the stove as we head back in those days didn't have the metal

87
00:07:09.72 --> 00:07:16.52
Charatney was just there was the the heat and there was a fire and I lost my balance and

88
00:07:17.16 --> 00:07:19.16
my butt fell back into the

89
00:07:19.16 --> 00:07:25.08
That against the stove and need us to say yeah, and a nice little burnout

90
00:07:25.96 --> 00:07:31.88
Couldn't go to school for about a week because couldn't wearing clothes and it was embarrassing to me to go to school

91
00:07:31.88 --> 00:07:34.52
And when people start saying why why were you out

92
00:07:35.48 --> 00:07:38.76
So that's it just when those things you know hurt my butt

93
00:07:40.20 --> 00:07:42.20
That's what you call burning in scientists

94
00:07:42.20 --> 00:07:49.40
Yeah, you say in here dad was a hardworking man, but he also enjoyed having fun

95
00:07:49.56 --> 00:07:55.56
When he returned from the war in 1946 he worked as a coal miner alongside his dad and rock springs Wyoming

96
00:07:56.36 --> 00:08:03.72
After he was injured in a mine cave in he decided he was not interested in miners career and move back to Missouri

97
00:08:04.04 --> 00:08:05.56
Where he'd been raised

98
00:08:05.56 --> 00:08:09.72
In 1947 he purchased the 72 egg acres. I came to know as our farm

99
00:08:09.72 --> 00:08:16.20
He attended classes on agriculture at the technical college under the GI bill

100
00:08:17.64 --> 00:08:23.08
And you say this let me pause to tell you about my father's service in the army world war two was when he served

101
00:08:23.08 --> 00:08:29.56
He never talked about the war until one Saturday in July 1997 after he had his stroke and was recovering in the

102
00:08:29.56 --> 00:08:31.56
University of Missouri hospital

103
00:08:31.96 --> 00:08:37.08
That and I started talking about what he did in the army from basic training until he was released from active duty

104
00:08:37.08 --> 00:08:39.96
Dad spent 36 months in the South Pacific

105
00:08:40.36 --> 00:08:44.20
We talked about what it was like to get shot at and how it felt to shoot another person

106
00:08:44.92 --> 00:08:51.000
That was a very laid back person it was hard to imagine him shooting someone we compared the food the army

107
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.68
Fettas and the types of weapons we had we both carried a call 45 our long rifles were very different

108
00:08:56.84 --> 00:08:59.64
We talked about fear while in combat

109
00:09:01.32 --> 00:09:05.48
Now you say your dad didn't really talk about that until 1997

110
00:09:05.48 --> 00:09:09.96
Right, so did you did you hear did you know he was in World War II growing up?

111
00:09:09.96 --> 00:09:13.56
Yeah, I knew he had been in World War II, but we never talked about it

112
00:09:14.28 --> 00:09:16.76
when I I've volunteered for the draft and

113
00:09:18.04 --> 00:09:21.64
When I came home and told my parents when I had done you know my mom

114
00:09:22.20 --> 00:09:25.16
Of course she broke into tears and

115
00:09:26.36 --> 00:09:28.84
Dad can't understand the situation and

116
00:09:30.04 --> 00:09:32.68
Remember he took me to the bus station

117
00:09:32.68 --> 00:09:41.000
God of Kansas City for the induction or take my physical and that's that was really the first time we talked about

118
00:09:41.80 --> 00:09:43.80
What it was like and

119
00:09:43.80 --> 00:09:46.84
More and he told me don't volunteer for anything

120
00:09:48.04 --> 00:09:50.04
I really listen to

121
00:09:50.04 --> 00:09:52.04
Famous last words. Yes

122
00:09:53.16 --> 00:09:58.84
Uh, you say when I turn 15 I spent most of my summers working for a neighbor who'd formed about

123
00:09:58.84 --> 00:10:03.16
500 acres my brothers had worked for him until they graduated then I took their place

124
00:10:04.20 --> 00:10:06.20
Your class president

125
00:10:06.44 --> 00:10:13.64
Yeah, you you had a really small school grown up 19 you're graduating class. Yes. You were class president. Yes

126
00:10:14.52 --> 00:10:20.04
You played the only sport you had was basketball correct which you were not genetically engineered to play

127
00:10:22.44 --> 00:10:26.20
I wasn't the tallest guy on the team. I didn't stretch the imagination

128
00:10:26.20 --> 00:10:28.20
But you played the duplai varsity

129
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.84
Well, we didn't have anything but varsity. So you were just playing you had one team you played on you didn't play

130
00:10:36.28 --> 00:10:40.04
So and then the only got 19 in your class you can't be real picking

131
00:10:42.28 --> 00:10:43.24
Uh

132
00:10:43.24 --> 00:10:50.84
You say after graduating from high school I moved to Columbia to work the summer for my uncle Rodney who owned a tree service since 1950

133
00:10:50.84 --> 00:10:52.84
Um

134
00:10:53.80 --> 00:10:58.20
In the fall of 1968 I moved to Louisville Kentucky to attend trade school for electronics

135
00:10:58.20 --> 00:11:01.24
I had a job working construction in the mornings and went to school in the afternoon

136
00:11:01.24 --> 00:11:04.60
I did this until January of 1969 when I ran out of money

137
00:11:06.04 --> 00:11:11.32
There's the end of February 1969 when a couple of my high school buddies and I were riding around the big town of

138
00:11:11.56 --> 00:11:17.000
Mobiley and decided to stop that the draft stop into the draft for to see where we were on the draft list

139
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.64
We'd all been in technical school and back then when you lost your draft deferment from college

140
00:11:21.64 --> 00:11:23.88
It seemed like you jumped up on the draft list

141
00:11:24.92 --> 00:11:28.52
Lady at the draft board told me that it would probably be April before I'd be drafted

142
00:11:28.84 --> 00:11:32.28
I asked her when the next group was scheduled to go and she told us it would be March

143
00:11:32.76 --> 00:11:37.40
I asked her to add me to the list so that was it. I just volunteered for the US army

144
00:11:38.92 --> 00:11:40.92
correct

145
00:11:40.92 --> 00:11:41.96
So

146
00:11:41.96 --> 00:11:42.92
This is

147
00:11:42.92 --> 00:11:49.24
1969 I mean the Vietnamist's war is clearly going on and you're seeing this in the news every day

148
00:11:49.24 --> 00:11:52.28
You know I've had quite a few people on the podcast that when they were

149
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
joining the military

150
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.88
It was

151
00:11:55.88 --> 00:11:57.16
1965

152
00:11:57.16 --> 00:12:03.16
66 they the Vietnam wasn't a guarantee like it must have been for you you must know 100% you were going to be an off

153
00:12:03.16 --> 00:12:06.92
I was exactly right. I mean in those days

154
00:12:07.96 --> 00:12:09.96
They needed troops and

155
00:12:09.96 --> 00:12:15.56
You know I cost me another year of my I volunteered for a two year

156
00:12:15.72 --> 00:12:18.92
But to get into special forces I had to

157
00:12:18.92 --> 00:12:20.92
Extend another year for training

158
00:12:20.92 --> 00:12:24.12
So I became a three-year commitment

159
00:12:24.52 --> 00:12:26.92
Were there like hippies

160
00:12:26.92 --> 00:12:30.36
Were you were in Moberley or was there was there not?

161
00:12:30.36 --> 00:12:33.000
That's so much in Moberley but it fought brag

162
00:12:33.56 --> 00:12:35.56
Where I ended up

163
00:12:35.72 --> 00:12:38.20
After a basic in a IT in jump school

164
00:12:38.20 --> 00:12:41.24
Yeah, we had our trained fondies and our

165
00:12:43.72 --> 00:12:45.08
Those

166
00:12:45.08 --> 00:12:47.08
People that like to protest

167
00:12:47.08 --> 00:12:50.12
But it was it seemed like for you and your group of friends

168
00:12:50.68 --> 00:12:53.40
Just patriotic this is what's going on. Yep

169
00:12:53.96 --> 00:12:55.32
Exactly

170
00:12:55.32 --> 00:12:59.72
It's a real area. I mean you know hippies were kind of a thought of as weird hours

171
00:13:00.76 --> 00:13:02.76
Still are my mind

172
00:13:02.76 --> 00:13:04.12
You know

173
00:13:04.12 --> 00:13:06.12
Just the way it goes

174
00:13:06.12 --> 00:13:08.12
haha

175
00:13:09.48 --> 00:13:13.48
Summer to love I guess was a little bit different for you and Moberley yeah, this is a little bit

176
00:13:14.28 --> 00:13:15.88
You say on March 17th

177
00:13:15.88 --> 00:13:21.64
1969 the day to report to the Moberley draft office my mom got me up early and dad and

178
00:13:21.96 --> 00:13:27.40
Fixed dad and me a big breakfast before she went to work there in the kitchen my mom gave me a big hug and we kissed

179
00:13:27.48 --> 00:13:29.88
She told me she loved me. She told me to be safe

180
00:13:30.28 --> 00:13:33.64
That was a tough day for mom as she walked out of the kitchen door to go to work

181
00:13:33.64 --> 00:13:35.64
I could she see she was crying

182
00:13:37.56 --> 00:13:40.68
Dad had taken the morning off to drive me to Moberley

183
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.28
So I could catch the Missouri transit bus to Kansas City from my physical and my swearing in it was bright sunny morning driving to Moberley

184
00:13:48.84 --> 00:13:53.24
Dad had a nice talk to me about what to expect at the army basic training

185
00:13:54.44 --> 00:13:56.52
He advised me to take it all with a grain of salt

186
00:13:56.52 --> 00:14:02.36
Dad had served in the Pacific theater during World War II and it's seen his share of combat in the Philippines

187
00:14:03.72 --> 00:14:09.56
Standing at the bus stop we hugged and he gave me some more good advice keep your nose clean your head down and

188
00:14:10.04 --> 00:14:12.04
Don't volunteer for anything

189
00:14:13.64 --> 00:14:17.24
Dad wiped back his tears as he walked back to his car

190
00:14:17.24 --> 00:14:24.92
Scott had a little bit of a different meaning when the war's going on in Vietnam

191
00:14:25.48 --> 00:14:31.88
And your dad had actually fought himself in Southeast Asia. He knows exactly what you're getting into exactly

192
00:14:34.36 --> 00:14:38.36
And he gave you some good advice which we're gonna find out you did not listen to

193
00:14:39.16 --> 00:14:41.16
All right

194
00:14:41.16 --> 00:14:50.76
Uh boot camp here we were issued our new nice green uniforms and all the good stuff that comes with it underwear socks boots and blankets are new friends

195
00:14:50.76 --> 00:14:55.88
The drill sergeants marched us or at least we called it marching over to get our first army haircut

196
00:14:55.88 --> 00:15:00.92
It took about one minute, but it was free and you know what they say you get what you pay for

197
00:15:02.76 --> 00:15:07.64
I'd only been in the army a few days when our company was brought into one of our training buildings

198
00:15:07.64 --> 00:15:13.56
There was this big bad looking rainbow guy who was looking for volunteers for the green berets

199
00:15:14.12 --> 00:15:20.04
I didn't know a lot about the green berets, but I did know they were one of the most elite fighting units in the army

200
00:15:20.04 --> 00:15:23.08
This guy looked as though he could have kicked any 10 of us at once

201
00:15:24.12 --> 00:15:30.20
I thought if I'm going to war I want to go with the best so I raised my hand when he asked if anyone wanted to volunteer for the green berets

202
00:15:30.44 --> 00:15:31.48
Special forces

203
00:15:31.48 --> 00:15:33.56
I knew this would cost me another year of service

204
00:15:33.56 --> 00:15:37.88
But I figured another year is worth the price to pay to be among the army's best

205
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.52
I guess those a poor listener when it came to my dad's advice about volunteer

206
00:15:42.52 --> 00:15:44.52
So how much did you know about special forces?

207
00:15:44.84 --> 00:15:47.88
Not a whole lot other than the green beret, you know

208
00:15:48.68 --> 00:15:49.72
the songs

209
00:15:49.72 --> 00:15:52.12
Very sadler yeah and then out and

210
00:15:52.76 --> 00:15:54.76
you know

211
00:15:54.76 --> 00:15:56.76
I knew that

212
00:15:57.48 --> 00:16:00.20
Special forces was special and

213
00:16:00.20 --> 00:16:09.80
But I really I knew no one at that time that was in special forces, but I I had done a little reading on them when I was

214
00:16:10.44 --> 00:16:14.28
Thinking about joining the military before I actually volunteer

215
00:16:14.92 --> 00:16:18.52
But I was felt like if I was going to go on one go with the best

216
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
How many guys from your boot camp

217
00:16:21.80 --> 00:16:24.68
Company do you think volunteered me

218
00:16:24.68 --> 00:16:30.76
Yeah, it was kind of you know

219
00:16:31.88 --> 00:16:34.28
I thought well you know that's why it's special maybe

220
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.96
What percentage of your boot camp company was draft these would you say?

221
00:16:37.96 --> 00:16:43.24
Probably 90 percent wow yeah we had it most of us are all drafties

222
00:16:43.24 --> 00:16:50.20
We had a few guys that were in reserve or national guard, but the rest of us are just drafties

223
00:16:50.20 --> 00:16:56.28
And you know we were there because Uncle Sam needed us there

224
00:16:57.56 --> 00:17:00.92
And so we took on the role of a soldier

225
00:17:05.40 --> 00:17:13.72
What was the kind of shock value of boot camp for you having grown up on a farm you've been working hard your whole life

226
00:17:13.72 --> 00:17:17.32
I mean when you you're getting you might have been easy for you

227
00:17:17.32 --> 00:17:23.80
I had one of my guys worked on a dairy farm up in Minnesota and for him being in the military was easy it was a vacation

228
00:17:24.52 --> 00:17:26.52
I agree

229
00:17:26.52 --> 00:17:32.20
You know it wasn't I remember that you know we had a

230
00:17:33.72 --> 00:17:39.24
My DI who was a veteran Vietnam found out that I was going to jump school and

231
00:17:39.24 --> 00:17:46.84
There was another Palmer 17 year old Palmer and that guy got me and more trouble he was going to jump school

232
00:17:47.56 --> 00:17:49.56
And so anytime

233
00:17:49.88 --> 00:17:51.88
He messed up I had to pay for it

234
00:17:52.28 --> 00:17:57.000
So I started messing up so he had to pay for it and we had a run in battle and

235
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.72
Trotsargent dynam was our drill sergeant and

236
00:18:00.76 --> 00:18:07.56
He just I remember we doing the pukele sticks and he called our number and we go out and

237
00:18:07.56 --> 00:18:14.12
And then he'd call somebody else's number need coming in but he wouldn't leave us he left us out there

238
00:18:14.12 --> 00:18:20.36
You know and then when I got tired he'd call for a power's number and I got to a point where the guy is

239
00:18:20.92 --> 00:18:23.08
felt sorry for him and of course

240
00:18:23.24 --> 00:18:29.000
That him said you guys either start smackin him or we will start smackin you and so you know

241
00:18:29.64 --> 00:18:34.04
They didn't have a really good choice and those little helmets we were we're worth a

242
00:18:34.04 --> 00:18:40.04
Pizza pie and nothing but I remember coming out of the man my head was ringing crazy

243
00:18:41.08 --> 00:18:43.08
You know that was the way it was and

244
00:18:43.96 --> 00:18:48.12
Why was Palmer going to airborne school he just wanted to go to the 80s second oh

245
00:18:48.12 --> 00:18:52.68
Yeah, he didn't want to go to special forces and he wanted to go to the 80s second air board

246
00:18:53.40 --> 00:18:57.80
And but that he was he was a stalkie young kid and

247
00:18:58.52 --> 00:19:01.16
17 years old smart new everything

248
00:19:01.16 --> 00:19:03.16
He thought

249
00:19:03.16 --> 00:19:06.20
And we're all blessed with how did they 17

250
00:19:08.20 --> 00:19:10.44
I have to thank and keep your mouse shut

251
00:19:11.96 --> 00:19:14.76
How long was bootcamp do you remember eight weeks yeah

252
00:19:15.64 --> 00:19:23.08
And did you get any infantry was it just very basic kind of indoctrination military pretty basic you know and then my AIT

253
00:19:23.08 --> 00:19:25.96
I was a combat engineer on the

254
00:19:25.96 --> 00:19:29.16
My AIT which is that four to eleven or Leonard wood as well

255
00:19:29.16 --> 00:19:34.76
So I spent basic and Leonard went and I spent my AIT at Leonard wood

256
00:19:35.96 --> 00:19:40.20
So that's just an advanced train extended period of time you're there now

257
00:19:41.40 --> 00:19:45.64
How did you end up getting an MOS of combat engineer did that get assigned to you?

258
00:19:45.64 --> 00:19:50.52
Yeah, that was that was the case you didn't make it through special forces training exactly

259
00:19:51.16 --> 00:19:56.68
Yeah, you went through your basic whatever the army, you know, whatever your military occupation is gonna be

260
00:19:56.68 --> 00:20:02.84
And then once you got into special forces then you decided you had a choice of you know medic

261
00:20:03.48 --> 00:20:05.48
You know we had the best medics and

262
00:20:07.32 --> 00:20:08.36
weapons

263
00:20:08.36 --> 00:20:10.36
Communications and

264
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.16
Intelligence and all that was a new request trained on all that

265
00:20:15.80 --> 00:20:19.56
Yeah, same thing they have now same they have the same system now right

266
00:20:19.56 --> 00:20:26.84
Um, took your first airplane ride after AIT you say I experienced my first airplane ride

267
00:20:26.84 --> 00:20:29.80
It took me from Fort Leonard wood to Fort Benning, Georgia

268
00:20:30.76 --> 00:20:36.60
Jump school as much as I expected a lot of running and push-ups and when you screwed up and morning inspections

269
00:20:37.72 --> 00:20:39.40
I went through jump school in August

270
00:20:40.20 --> 00:20:46.12
Fast forward a little bit here you said I had the good fortune going through jump school with some navy seals from team two if I recall correctly

271
00:20:46.12 --> 00:20:51.88
When they learned that I was headed for special forces training they decided they would adopt me into their ranks

272
00:20:52.92 --> 00:20:59.16
The water troughs we were we had were about a foot deep and 18 inches wide the seals stopped

273
00:20:59.64 --> 00:21:06.36
Up one of the troughs and filled it with water then about six of them grabbed me and dunked me in the water until I thought I was going to drown

274
00:21:06.76 --> 00:21:09.24
From then on they deemed me an honorary seal

275
00:21:10.12 --> 00:21:14.28
I guess you might say I had my first taste of water boat boarding

276
00:21:14.28 --> 00:21:21.88
They were actually great bunch of guys one day we were headed back to the barracks after a day training one of the seals was made to run around the platoon

277
00:21:22.12 --> 00:21:24.12
while we did the airborne shuffle

278
00:21:25.80 --> 00:21:30.52
Well the seals have a very high degree of a spree decor if one of them was dropped for push-ups

279
00:21:30.52 --> 00:21:33.80
They all did push-ups so if one seal had to run around our platoon they all would

280
00:21:34.28 --> 00:21:39.000
Think about that the seals were running circles around us as we soldiers did the airborne shuffle

281
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.76
Now to say this pissed off the cadre as an understatement the next thing I knew we were running what felt like a sprint as the seals ran around the platoon

282
00:21:47.08 --> 00:21:53.88
By the time we made it back to the barracks we were all exhausted the cadre then had the seals doing push-ups for the next ten or 15 minutes

283
00:21:53.88 --> 00:21:57.96
I developed a real appreciation for the level of camaraderie the seals have

284
00:21:59.88 --> 00:22:00.84
I

285
00:22:00.84 --> 00:22:04.28
Went to airborne school they don't seals don't go to airborne school anymore and for a better journey

286
00:22:04.28 --> 00:22:10.36
They go through the Navy has their own little program now, but so I I was I don't know when they stopped it

287
00:22:10.36 --> 00:22:14.20
It was quite a few years after me, but it was definitely that situation

288
00:22:14.20 --> 00:22:18.92
We would go down there you know we were like you said earlier we were so we were young

289
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.64
So we thought we knew everything but we were definitely a good shape because we were just coming out of seal training and airborne

290
00:22:26.44 --> 00:22:28.68
school especially this is like 1990

291
00:22:28.68 --> 00:22:36.20
1991 I think it's when I was going through airborne school so at that time there's all kinds of people from

292
00:22:36.76 --> 00:22:40.28
The army going through airborne and the air force it wasn't

293
00:22:41.32 --> 00:22:44.44
It wasn't though it wasn't high standards of physical training

294
00:22:45.08 --> 00:22:50.60
Not very high so you know we come out of basic seal training where we're like animals

295
00:22:51.64 --> 00:22:54.12
We're just having fun make it do anything to hurt us

296
00:22:54.12 --> 00:23:00.92
But had some good really good memories of the black cats down there. They were awesome. They were they were very cool

297
00:23:02.60 --> 00:23:08.28
Yeah, it's it's too bad they don't join us up for that anymore. It was kind of fun even the all tell you

298
00:23:08.28 --> 00:23:10.76
I had a kid asking me about it the other day and

299
00:23:12.84 --> 00:23:17.88
Man that that's weird that's where I really learned about the herd up and wait like never before

300
00:23:17.88 --> 00:23:23.72
I mean you get you know we'd meet it to a clock in the morning to start getting your parachute on

301
00:23:24.68 --> 00:23:29.48
At four o'clock in the morning you're getting your first inspection at six o'clock in the morning

302
00:23:29.48 --> 00:23:35.000
You're taking a bus out to the plane at eight o'clock in the morning. You're getting on the plane at 10 o'clock in the morning

303
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.24
The plane takes off and it noon you jump

304
00:23:37.88 --> 00:23:41.24
I've been doing this for 10 hours. This is a 30 second evolution

305
00:23:43.96 --> 00:23:45.96
Good times

306
00:23:45.96 --> 00:23:47.96
uh

307
00:23:47.96 --> 00:23:49.40
you finish

308
00:23:49.40 --> 00:23:50.76
Airborne school and

309
00:23:51.48 --> 00:23:53.24
You roll into September

310
00:23:53.80 --> 00:23:57.88
1969 special forces training you say one certain night in September

311
00:23:58.28 --> 00:24:03.16
1969 74 top notch soldiers out of a hundred screen out of hundreds screen

312
00:24:03.88 --> 00:24:09.56
Jumped into the dz at camp a call near Fort Bragg with all their equipment and one change of fatigue

313
00:24:09.96 --> 00:24:14.60
That's all we would have for the next few weeks. We are about four miles from what would be

314
00:24:14.60 --> 00:24:16.60
Or what would become our base camp?

315
00:24:16.60 --> 00:24:20.20
It was about 10 p.m. and the welcome committee was ready for us

316
00:24:20.60 --> 00:24:23.72
Now you could tell these guys really look forward to our arrival

317
00:24:23.96 --> 00:24:30.60
They cadre quickly assembled and started marching us to camp up on this dirt road with our rucksacks and our weapons

318
00:24:30.76 --> 00:24:35.08
So this is your start of special forces training you're going your jumping into school

319
00:24:35.40 --> 00:24:36.44
All right correct

320
00:24:36.44 --> 00:24:41.48
Okay, my call and you just have what you have on you an extra change of camis and

321
00:24:41.48 --> 00:24:45.08
And your gear regular gear yep

322
00:24:46.12 --> 00:24:48.12
Deep what kind of brief did you get before this

323
00:24:50.28 --> 00:25:02.52
Did you get a brief call and we all knew that's the year that's where the washout started you know and so so once you start

324
00:25:03.56 --> 00:25:08.76
Once you start this this section of special forces training and people start washing out are they quitting or they failing?

325
00:25:08.76 --> 00:25:14.68
What's going on combination some guys you know on the just on the night in that first night

326
00:25:14.68 --> 00:25:16.68
We lost probably 15 guys

327
00:25:17.56 --> 00:25:20.28
Just they went for them. I mean they couldn't take the

328
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
harassment and the guy yeah, I mean

329
00:25:24.28 --> 00:25:26.28
Those the cadre out there were

330
00:25:27.56 --> 00:25:29.56
You know they

331
00:25:29.32 --> 00:25:33.72
They knew how to get under your skin and and in a very short time

332
00:25:33.72 --> 00:25:38.92
I remember seeing some guys get so bad, you know, they take a swing element

333
00:25:39.48 --> 00:25:42.04
It was like oh you don't want to do that you know

334
00:25:42.76 --> 00:25:45.48
Wrong wrong wrong and

335
00:25:45.48 --> 00:25:48.20
Next thing you know you know that person in around anymore

336
00:25:49.32 --> 00:25:51.32
But that's

337
00:25:51.32 --> 00:25:55.64
That's the way when we're reading them out you know and getting people there that really

338
00:25:56.52 --> 00:25:59.64
Wanted to be in special forces and knew that there was going to be some

339
00:25:59.64 --> 00:26:04.68
Ups and downs to the training part of it and and then all through

340
00:26:05.56 --> 00:26:07.56
I think we were out there like eight weeks and

341
00:26:08.60 --> 00:26:10.60
You know you learned

342
00:26:10.60 --> 00:26:19.80
You know all the basics of you know patroling things like that they went into a little more advanced, you know how to set up ambushes and then you know a different

343
00:26:21.16 --> 00:26:22.84
types of

344
00:26:22.84 --> 00:26:26.12
Medical deals and going on or raid, you know

345
00:26:26.12 --> 00:26:31.16
Well or a mission and you had your right to your mission reports and things like that

346
00:26:31.16 --> 00:26:38.76
See it was a kind of an overall view of everything that you would need in an 18 and

347
00:26:39.40 --> 00:26:41.64
You know at this point we were

348
00:26:41.96 --> 00:26:43.96
Medix we were weapons we were just

349
00:26:44.68 --> 00:26:53.32
Green green braze and that you know we're just hoping to get through the next level to where they could then select the MOS we wanted and go

350
00:26:53.32 --> 00:26:59.48
That's when the training really started for special forces this was we're gonna weed you out

351
00:26:59.88 --> 00:27:06.28
We're gonna make sure that this is what you want because if you don't can handle this you're not gonna handle anything else

352
00:27:06.28 --> 00:27:07.88
Then we don't want you

353
00:27:07.88 --> 00:27:10.04
I forgot to mention that when you were in boot camp

354
00:27:10.60 --> 00:27:16.60
You scored a perfect 500 on the on the physical fitness test. So you were just a good athlete for sure

355
00:27:16.60 --> 00:27:23.88
How I was I was in good shape back then and a fast runner you mentioned that specifically you were a fast runner

356
00:27:25.24 --> 00:27:33.08
And then you know it are you doing a lot of patroling like long long marches during special force training because I think it's different now

357
00:27:33.08 --> 00:27:35.08
Yeah, I think I want to say it

358
00:27:35.40 --> 00:27:40.68
They weren't long marches, but you know you you'd go out and camp out overnight

359
00:27:40.92 --> 00:27:45.48
You know and kind of make do with which had you know everybody had their a little tense

360
00:27:45.48 --> 00:27:52.04
But you know a lot times we didn't even use them we're just unroll a sleeping bag and sleep out on the star

361
00:27:52.04 --> 00:27:54.04
So to speak and

362
00:27:54.36 --> 00:27:58.20
That was part of it as well. How much were you eating?

363
00:27:59.64 --> 00:28:05.64
Well you had back then we had the old sea rations, you know, so they would bring in

364
00:28:07.32 --> 00:28:13.16
The meals and I mean we made those were our meals for all three meals. You know we had

365
00:28:13.16 --> 00:28:15.16
pound cake

366
00:28:17.72 --> 00:28:19.72
And ham and mothers

367
00:28:21.32 --> 00:28:23.32
Was a favorite and then

368
00:28:23.80 --> 00:28:31.24
Beans and weanies, you know, we're saying put it right and bring it out in a big you know 50 gallon or 25 gallon

369
00:28:32.44 --> 00:28:39.32
For the water and they put the heaters in them so that each food and then you need your P38

370
00:28:39.88 --> 00:28:41.88
Open the can and

371
00:28:41.88 --> 00:28:46.36
That's and you need here and guys trying to barter with you know

372
00:28:46.36 --> 00:28:51.72
So ham and mothers fuckers were the first you know nobody wanted them and you need your some guy

373
00:28:51.96 --> 00:28:53.72
I'll trade this for you

374
00:28:53.72 --> 00:28:54.76
Pallent cake

375
00:28:54.76 --> 00:28:56.76
Pallent cake for rotten too

376
00:28:57.48 --> 00:29:00.60
But you know that that was before sea rations or

377
00:29:01.48 --> 00:29:02.84
Lurps came out for us

378
00:29:02.84 --> 00:29:04.04
So

379
00:29:04.04 --> 00:29:06.04
yeah, it's always

380
00:29:06.04 --> 00:29:12.28
But you know I went through basic seal training and there you get to eat and you get to eat

381
00:29:12.28 --> 00:29:19.000
Actually a lot most of the time you're getting three meals a day and usually one or two of them are in a

382
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.76
Chow Hall where it's basically all you can eat and I always feel

383
00:29:23.32 --> 00:29:29.08
You know the Rangers that get one MRE day for whatever that is you know 85 days and

384
00:29:29.08 --> 00:29:34.84
You know they those guys always lose 20 yeah 15 20 25 pounds I gained

385
00:29:36.20 --> 00:29:38.20
I gained 11 pounds

386
00:29:38.20 --> 00:29:44.44
There was your seal train well yeah, I went from 174 to 185 and that's working out however long you're working out

387
00:29:44.44 --> 00:29:50.92
You know doing a ton of physical activity, but I was just eating a ton and you could get like get done at night

388
00:29:52.12 --> 00:29:54.36
I would be ordering pizza at

389
00:29:54.36 --> 00:29:59.32
At 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock at night. I don't order pizza dominoes would deliver

390
00:29:59.88 --> 00:30:04.84
We would eat pizza just about well we eat up pizza on a lot of nights so we're getting a lot of calories

391
00:30:05.24 --> 00:30:07.24
But I always found that the

392
00:30:07.24 --> 00:30:13.000
The army has a little bit more stringent about what they're gonna let you eat their special forces schools

393
00:30:13.56 --> 00:30:16.84
I remember in the first time I ate it I air force

394
00:30:17.72 --> 00:30:23.24
Oh yeah, my god next level. Oh, yeah, I mean I remember they say ask you

395
00:30:23.24 --> 00:30:25.24
How you watch her eggs?

396
00:30:25.24 --> 00:30:27.24
I'm thinking you're asking

397
00:30:27.88 --> 00:30:33.32
You know normally it's scrambled, you know and I told them how like my eggs. It's okay

398
00:30:34.12 --> 00:30:36.12
I'm gonna like this play

399
00:30:36.60 --> 00:30:42.60
Yeah, the air force definitely puts a priority on yeah on comfort. I will say on comfort they do

400
00:30:42.60 --> 00:30:46.04
I've always heard that the air force like when they design a base

401
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.24
The first thing they build is the barracks then they build the recreation

402
00:30:51.24 --> 00:30:57.40
Then they build the gymnasium then they jibil the pool then they build the golf course and now they're just about any

403
00:30:57.56 --> 00:31:01.40
Out of money and they say to the government well we still need an air you know, he's still leaving an air strap

404
00:31:01.96 --> 00:31:03.96
You know in some hangers

405
00:31:03.96 --> 00:31:05.96
They go well we don't have any choice but the builders

406
00:31:06.84 --> 00:31:09.000
That's what I've always heard. I don't know if that's true

407
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
But I was worried I did really

408
00:31:11.40 --> 00:31:16.76
Was there anything that was really hard for you going through this a national special forces selection? No

409
00:31:16.76 --> 00:31:24.12
I you know I kind of breeze through it. I remember the first time I was ever exhausted where I couldn't do pushups was

410
00:31:24.60 --> 00:31:26.60
the night we landed and

411
00:31:27.24 --> 00:31:33.80
We kept up another guy lol and I kept up with a cadry all the way into the base camp

412
00:31:34.36 --> 00:31:37.88
And then when we got there you know of course the ask your question are you tired?

413
00:31:38.28 --> 00:31:42.44
And we knew it was a trick question. We said no you can say drop new pushups

414
00:31:42.44 --> 00:31:48.68
I literally I could not do another pushup. You know I mean I thought oh no this is it they're kind of flushed me

415
00:31:49.32 --> 00:31:54.60
But you know when the other guys all got in you know they said get up and get in back and fall in

416
00:31:55.24 --> 00:31:57.72
some of the we got a blessing there

417
00:31:58.12 --> 00:32:00.12
So uh

418
00:32:00.84 --> 00:32:02.84
You say this in the book um

419
00:32:04.68 --> 00:32:07.72
I always tried to add humor to anything that I do

420
00:32:07.72 --> 00:32:12.76
One early morning the company was in formation waiting for the cadry to join us on that day

421
00:32:12.76 --> 00:32:18.44
I was the student company commander while we were waiting I shouted out a command to that anyone who that can't

422
00:32:18.60 --> 00:32:21.88
Tamped out tamp tap dance must be a sissy

423
00:32:22.60 --> 00:32:25.40
Well the entire company started tap dancing in place

424
00:32:26.12 --> 00:32:27.72
All of a sudden they all stopped

425
00:32:27.72 --> 00:32:33.32
I had my back to the cadry building and it was at that time that I realized I was the only one still tap dancing

426
00:32:33.32 --> 00:32:37.80
I stopped and slowly turned around and stood there and there stood the cadry

427
00:32:38.52 --> 00:32:43.80
They did have a sense of humor and got a chuckle out of it, but they told me to drop and start doing pushups

428
00:32:44.36 --> 00:32:49.48
And here you have one of your first life lessons in this book life lesson one add humor

429
00:32:50.76 --> 00:32:55.40
It really helps when things are getting tough sometimes it's not easy to find it within you

430
00:32:55.40 --> 00:33:02.20
But even the POWs somehow found a way to pass some slivers of humor through the cracks and the prison walls

431
00:33:02.20 --> 00:33:04.20
The soul needs it

432
00:33:04.20 --> 00:33:08.76
Make sure you contribute some for the benefit of the people around you

433
00:33:10.84 --> 00:33:17.80
You know, I mean it's interesting that we're sitting here laughing about the stories anyways because you got to have fun doing this stuff

434
00:33:17.80 --> 00:33:19.80
You win it's miserable exactly

435
00:33:21.08 --> 00:33:24.92
You get done with selection and you say I was sent to my

436
00:33:24.92 --> 00:33:32.68
Special forces MOS and special forces there were five MOS options weapons engineer communication in telemedical

437
00:33:33.72 --> 00:33:38.06
And you ended up with communications MOS now is that cuz you

438
00:33:38.44 --> 00:33:40.44
Is that right?

439
00:33:40.44 --> 00:33:42.44
I thought you did I

440
00:33:42.44 --> 00:33:44.44
Did communications on the raid

441
00:33:44.44 --> 00:33:46.44
Okay, but my MOS was

442
00:33:46.44 --> 00:33:54.60
12-proval of as an engineer, okay weapon or demolitions so they kept you and you were an engineer anyways you'd been through

443
00:33:55.32 --> 00:33:59.64
AIT right that was as an engineer, so they put you as an engineer. Okay, hmm

444
00:34:00.20 --> 00:34:02.20
I did something's right

445
00:34:03.64 --> 00:34:07.40
And would you learn about so so talk a little bit about engineers what are you doing in that?

446
00:34:07.64 --> 00:34:08.84
specialty

447
00:34:08.84 --> 00:34:15.64
Where you learn down to bird build bridges, you know across rivers and things like that and then of course part of that was demolition

448
00:34:15.64 --> 00:34:22.92
You know how to use debt core and how to build your own bombs for you know soap dishes and dust initiators things like that

449
00:34:23.48 --> 00:34:31.80
That were used and then you know how to how to basically use a debt cord to knock down trees and stuff and

450
00:34:32.52 --> 00:34:33.88
It was

451
00:34:33.88 --> 00:34:40.36
Remove a class after maybe we lost about eight or nine guys in a accident. I don't know a demo range

452
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
You know what happened we had a a

453
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.48
The guy that was doing connecting

454
00:34:48.28 --> 00:34:54.60
We did it what's called a ring main and in the ring main the last one that connects

455
00:34:55.64 --> 00:35:02.28
Is then connected to the hut wire on the battery and we were using electric blasting caps

456
00:35:03.08 --> 00:35:06.44
And they forgot to disconnect the other side and

457
00:35:07.56 --> 00:35:09.88
We lost about a heater nine guys

458
00:35:09.88 --> 00:35:15.88
On one the end of the day and they were all kneeling over there

459
00:35:16.92 --> 00:35:24.36
Working on it. Yeah, it was it it was a real shame, but you know somebody forgot and

460
00:35:25.80 --> 00:35:27.80
Awesome good man

461
00:35:28.36 --> 00:35:30.36
Man, yep

462
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.48
That's awful. Yeah, those uh

463
00:35:34.68 --> 00:35:37.16
You got a pay attention when you work with demolitions

464
00:35:37.16 --> 00:35:39.72
You just have to yeah

465
00:35:40.92 --> 00:35:45.64
One one little air like that and put it into your career. That's for sure

466
00:35:46.68 --> 00:35:50.12
And I bet the guy that was actually near the blasting machine

467
00:35:50.84 --> 00:35:54.44
He wasn't by a charge right so that lives yeah, he lived

468
00:35:55.32 --> 00:35:58.52
And I live without the rest of his life

469
00:35:59.72 --> 00:36:01.72
Yeah

470
00:36:01.72 --> 00:36:03.72
Um

471
00:36:05.24 --> 00:36:07.24
Fast forward a little bit

472
00:36:07.24 --> 00:36:11.08
You say here after I completed special forces MOS training in March

473
00:36:11.48 --> 00:36:18.20
1970 we were all then assigned to a group at this time fifth group was responsible for Vietnam and as warriors

474
00:36:18.60 --> 00:36:21.32
Everyone wanted to be assigned a fifth group including myself

475
00:36:21.88 --> 00:36:25.80
However, there were two groups at four brags sixth group and seventh group

476
00:36:25.80 --> 00:36:31.96
I was assigned a seventh group like any good soldier you do as you're a told and make the best of it

477
00:36:31.96 --> 00:36:33.96
I was proud to be a green beret

478
00:36:35.40 --> 00:36:40.12
That summer brought me to the notting hala. I said that right man. Holy notting hally

479
00:36:40.92 --> 00:36:45.96
National forest from which I was picked to be part of bull Simon's mysterious

480
00:36:47.32 --> 00:36:50.68
Mission so on September 2nd 1970 as

481
00:36:50.68 --> 00:36:57.72
Member of the advanced party we loaded on the C1 23's southbound so bill Simon's

482
00:36:58.84 --> 00:37:00.84
This guy is a legend

483
00:37:01.40 --> 00:37:06.20
World War II he fought in in New Guinea he was a ranger

484
00:37:06.60 --> 00:37:08.60
He conducted a raid

485
00:37:08.60 --> 00:37:12.28
That was a that was a POW rescue they rescued in the Philippines

486
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Over 500 POWs

487
00:37:15.40 --> 00:37:17.96
Many of whom had participated in the baton death march

488
00:37:17.96 --> 00:37:19.96
Mm-hmm

489
00:37:19.96 --> 00:37:25.32
Then he'd gotten out for a couple years and then came back in use in special forces

490
00:37:26.36 --> 00:37:31.24
He was in sag I mean he this guy was a legendary guy and

491
00:37:31.96 --> 00:37:37.08
How did that happen that you got picked for this for this mission? How did you hear about the mission? How did you get picked?

492
00:37:37.08 --> 00:37:40.28
Well, I was up at Netahaley and I was training

493
00:37:41.32 --> 00:37:44.76
I was working with a bunch of master sergeants and been

494
00:37:44.76 --> 00:37:51.64
E5 and we were teaching mountain climbing in rope tie and all officers and some of the guys in seventh group

495
00:37:52.44 --> 00:37:55.16
And we needed some supplies so

496
00:37:55.80 --> 00:38:01.88
Colonel told me we went to town pick up supplies and which netahaley's about

497
00:38:02.36 --> 00:38:08.12
Probably 250 300 miles from Fort Brank so I went back down in a brang and

498
00:38:08.12 --> 00:38:14.28
And a couple of my buddies said when I got down and they said hey, did you see where bullseyements is looking for

499
00:38:15.16 --> 00:38:20.84
Volunteers and of course bullseyements. I mean just I mean that was enough to

500
00:38:21.56 --> 00:38:24.44
Excite you and you didn't want to be there so

501
00:38:25.64 --> 00:38:30.92
I said well I'm gonna go down see what he's talking about because they said if you and he was gonna be down

502
00:38:30.92 --> 00:38:34.12
It's a we call it a little White House. They're for brang

503
00:38:34.12 --> 00:38:38.36
I got down there. It was packed. I mean they were probably 500 plus

504
00:38:38.92 --> 00:38:46.04
Special forces guys there and bull came out on the stage and he always had a little cigar in his mouth

505
00:38:46.04 --> 00:38:48.52
He never smoked it. I don't know. He just too none of you

506
00:38:49.08 --> 00:38:53.80
But he yeah, I had never seen the guy so that was kind of my first

507
00:38:55.08 --> 00:39:00.20
Introduction to Colonel send up and he looks like a legend

508
00:39:00.20 --> 00:39:04.60
He's his physical appearance. He looks like a lift. He is a legend

509
00:39:05.72 --> 00:39:09.72
I mean he's yeah, there's no doubt about that and

510
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.68
So when he came on stage you know he said I was looking for

511
00:39:15.80 --> 00:39:19.16
Some volunteers or a moderately hazardous mission and

512
00:39:20.76 --> 00:39:22.76
I always wondered what he called hazardous

513
00:39:24.44 --> 00:39:26.44
Compared to what we were

514
00:39:26.44 --> 00:39:31.56
He didn't ready to go do but he said there's no TDY

515
00:39:31.56 --> 00:39:33.56
So you know that eliminated some guys

516
00:39:33.96 --> 00:39:36.12
You know everybody was temporary money

517
00:39:36.60 --> 00:39:40.92
duty money and he said if you're interested get back here

518
00:39:40.92 --> 00:39:43.96
We'll start the interview process at that 13 hundred hours

519
00:39:44.84 --> 00:39:47.64
so I went back and

520
00:39:49.48 --> 00:39:52.28
Put my name on the list and the next I

521
00:39:53.56 --> 00:39:55.56
came back to

522
00:39:55.56 --> 00:40:01.40
I mean they had two certain majors doing a lot of the interviewing two commands hard majors and

523
00:40:02.20 --> 00:40:04.60
We were in an in line at the seventh group

524
00:40:05.72 --> 00:40:07.72
Facility billets and

525
00:40:08.60 --> 00:40:16.60
He was about probably about five thirty I guess and I was sitting there and nobody's called me and nobody's called me and everybody else pretty much

526
00:40:16.60 --> 00:40:17.88
God and

527
00:40:17.88 --> 00:40:19.08
Alex these two

528
00:40:19.08 --> 00:40:22.44
Hard majors and they're walking out the door and I'm thinking

529
00:40:22.44 --> 00:40:27.000
Well, they didn't interview me and so I were in after him and holiday them

530
00:40:27.48 --> 00:40:30.20
I said you know hey you guys didn't interview me

531
00:40:31.40 --> 00:40:34.60
And they said what's your name and I said buckler and they said

532
00:40:35.24 --> 00:40:37.96
Well, and he had a clipboard on him look at he says

533
00:40:38.52 --> 00:40:40.20
I don't have your two on one file

534
00:40:40.20 --> 00:40:43.64
That's the military and army that's your

535
00:40:44.52 --> 00:40:50.76
File tells you everything about who you are and what you've done in your record and I said they said

536
00:40:50.76 --> 00:40:57.32
Well, I'm on interview and they said well you get your two on one file be back here first thing in the morning morning or

537
00:40:57.32 --> 00:40:59.32
You so okay, so

538
00:40:59.96 --> 00:41:04.28
Buddy man at that time was one of my roommates or a bunch of us lived off base

539
00:41:04.28 --> 00:41:07.08
You know we had seven of us in

540
00:41:07.72 --> 00:41:15.16
In the sixth and seven of us in the seventh group so we were only time we were together with payday and holidays

541
00:41:15.80 --> 00:41:17.80
and so we kind of

542
00:41:17.80 --> 00:41:21.80
The neighborhood I think was glad to see us move, but

543
00:41:22.52 --> 00:41:27.64
You know, he was a deputy sheriff who lived down the road from us and he was always stopping by and see guys

544
00:41:27.64 --> 00:41:30.12
Can you just hold it down just a little bit?

545
00:41:30.12 --> 00:41:32.76
Yeah, so anyway

546
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.12
I went in for the interview you know and they asked me if I could weld and I said

547
00:41:41.40 --> 00:41:46.68
I grew up on farm and our neighbor Sam welded everything we ever broke because I looked at that

548
00:41:46.68 --> 00:41:53.72
I thought I can do that so I said yeah, I'm a welder and you so you felt like you could weld because you watched your buddy

549
00:41:53.72 --> 00:42:00.12
Well, okay, I like it. I like your attitude. Let's get back to you. I didn't have a welder so I went have to

550
00:42:00.12 --> 00:42:02.12
Prove myself yeah

551
00:42:02.12 --> 00:42:05.72
And then I went and know if I did scuba and I

552
00:42:05.96 --> 00:42:12.28
Had met that point nine scuba so I said no, I don't know scuba and then just ask me some general questions

553
00:42:12.28 --> 00:42:18.76
You know what how much combat have you been and I'm thinking they got my 201 file. I have no combat experience

554
00:42:19.48 --> 00:42:24.92
And so I said no, I know then so I said okay, well, thanks

555
00:42:25.32 --> 00:42:29.96
I thought well at least they let me interview so you know, thank you and I walked out the door

556
00:42:30.84 --> 00:42:34.92
Back up to not a daily been and a couple of days later

557
00:42:34.92 --> 00:42:40.76
A kernel from our called me and there's office up at the not a daily there and he says a

558
00:42:41.48 --> 00:42:43.48
Pack your bag

559
00:42:43.48 --> 00:42:45.48
That's a whoa, okay

560
00:42:45.48 --> 00:42:52.92
He says you made bull Simon's list and I said really and he said yep, so I said okay and

561
00:42:53.72 --> 00:42:58.84
Dad, I went you know, I'm very excited not even knowing what we're gonna do just the fact that

562
00:42:59.32 --> 00:43:03.96
We made it. Did you have any idea why they selected you to this day?

563
00:43:03.96 --> 00:43:07.24
I know the thing I could figure out is they needed some

564
00:43:08.12 --> 00:43:11.56
In special forces aside from your crack welding skills

565
00:43:19.56 --> 00:43:26.12
I think what they needed was some grunts and in special forces the knee five is the laws rang

566
00:43:26.68 --> 00:43:32.12
So they I was on the advanced party and we went down and set up the compound and

567
00:43:32.12 --> 00:43:39.88
We when they swept the building we put the consentino wire around and put the fuel phone now and then I pulled guard duty

568
00:43:40.28 --> 00:43:45.80
On the bet we had to guard that building 24 by seven and I thought it was a little unusual because

569
00:43:46.68 --> 00:43:49.32
When we pulled guard duty it bragged yet you got a

570
00:43:50.28 --> 00:43:53.08
16 in one round maybe and

571
00:43:53.08 --> 00:43:59.88
And this when we had him 16 and full round and my orders if that goes south shoot and that

572
00:43:59.88 --> 00:44:06.28
I thought there's some series on this mission that they're not telling everybody about but you know

573
00:44:06.28 --> 00:44:08.28
We did what we were told to do and

574
00:44:10.60 --> 00:44:14.04
That's I pulled guard duty and when I went and pulled guard duty

575
00:44:14.04 --> 00:44:22.28
I was either sleeping or training because I had to train with the other guys during when I wasn't pulled in guard duty

576
00:44:24.20 --> 00:44:29.64
You say this so you fly down there and where's the location fly to and in an eggland

577
00:44:29.64 --> 00:44:31.64
Air Force Base so

578
00:44:32.60 --> 00:44:37.32
You say now bull wasn't the only legendary officer attached to the saute raid

579
00:44:37.80 --> 00:44:40.92
Captain dick meadows would lead blue boy a

580
00:44:41.16 --> 00:44:46.36
Salt group which would land directly inside the POW camp walls and listed in

581
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.84
1946 a pair trooper in the Korean War in the early 60s

582
00:44:51.40 --> 00:44:58.44
Meadows served ascent with the British special air service in Vietnam meadows captured video footage proving North Vietnam

583
00:44:58.44 --> 00:45:05.32
Army was infiltrating south Vietnam and impressed general was Westmoreland so much that in 1967

584
00:45:05.56 --> 00:45:08.44
He received a battlefield commission directly to captain

585
00:45:09.80 --> 00:45:15.24
He was the commanding officer of Ranger school when bull's simons recruited him for the sauntay raid

586
00:45:15.96 --> 00:45:18.44
Lieutenant Colonel but Sidner was

587
00:45:19.56 --> 00:45:22.84
Selected by bull's simons to serve as the ground forces commander

588
00:45:22.84 --> 00:45:30.28
Whereas bull's simons role would be the on-scene eyes and ears of the joint contingency task group in constant

589
00:45:30.52 --> 00:45:32.52
Contact with general manner

590
00:45:32.52 --> 00:45:38.44
Lieutenant Colonel Sidner had the reputation of a gentleman and a consummate professional one day

591
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Brigadier general blackburn from the Pentagon Brigadier general manner

592
00:45:43.96 --> 00:45:46.12
Bull's simons and Captain dick meadows

593
00:45:46.12 --> 00:45:53.56
Showed up as a group and requested access to the operation center. I check their IDs and called in for someone to come out

594
00:45:53.56 --> 00:45:54.60
Nascort them in

595
00:45:54.60 --> 00:46:02.36
Lieutenant Colonel Sidner comes out the gate. Can you imagine how I felt here? I am a 20-year-old buck sergeant standing in the midst of some of the most

596
00:46:02.44 --> 00:46:06.76
Notable special operations forces officers ever. I remember

597
00:46:07.32 --> 00:46:12.76
They treated me as one of them making small talk with me after a while Lieutenant Colonel Sidner took them inside

598
00:46:12.76 --> 00:46:17.72
This was one of the great things about special forces the officers and enlisted men tree each other with respect

599
00:46:17.72 --> 00:46:23.48
I believe this is because you have to depend on one another when you operate in small teams like special forces

600
00:46:23.48 --> 00:46:26.28
So they were super strict about who's coming into this building?

601
00:46:27.32 --> 00:46:33.88
Yeah, I mean it was you didn't get in the building. I don't care how many times you've been in that building

602
00:46:34.84 --> 00:46:40.68
When you went back in I had to check your ID and or whoever the guard was

603
00:46:40.68 --> 00:46:48.60
Calling and we had a feel phone set up and calling somebody would come out and verify that they were who they were and let them in

604
00:46:49.32 --> 00:46:53.80
That's called them into the building and at where you go to getting to go into the building?

605
00:46:53.80 --> 00:46:55.80
No, no, you even know what you're guarding

606
00:46:57.08 --> 00:47:01.72
We used to laugh about that because we would say what I think I didn't know you know

607
00:47:02.52 --> 00:47:06.04
So private to see about we kept thinking women

608
00:47:06.04 --> 00:47:11.08
But we knew that could have me was none of us in red escorted in a meal

609
00:47:12.12 --> 00:47:16.60
So yeah, they were very strict. I mean on that it was

610
00:47:18.36 --> 00:47:23.80
They didn't want anybody in that building and there was only a limited amount of people that could get in there

611
00:47:24.68 --> 00:47:30.68
And I'd say probably maybe 25 to 30 at the most that were ever allowed in the building

612
00:47:30.68 --> 00:47:37.64
Well, you're standing in this guard duty and you're doing the best of your ability which leads us to another life lesson you have in here

613
00:47:37.64 --> 00:47:43.40
Life lesson two your life is significant so be excellent in everything you do no matter how

614
00:47:43.72 --> 00:47:47.64
In significant you think your job is it could turn out to be a life-changing position

615
00:47:48.04 --> 00:47:52.84
One of the reasons Captain Dan eventually selected me to be paired with him was that during all the time

616
00:47:52.84 --> 00:47:57.88
I spent pulling guard duty and training. I never complained but always did what was asked to me

617
00:47:57.88 --> 00:48:03.64
I credit my dad for instilling this attitude in my brothers and me. He always told us if you're gonna do anything

618
00:48:03.96 --> 00:48:05.96
Do your best

619
00:48:07.08 --> 00:48:09.08
correct

620
00:48:09.64 --> 00:48:11.64
That's an important one

621
00:48:12.20 --> 00:48:20.36
You go on to say here as the member as a member of the advanced party another one of our tasks was to build this large mock-up of buildings

622
00:48:20.36 --> 00:48:28.84
Using target canvas as the walls with doors with cutouts for windows we began constructing it on Thursday September 10th and it took us

623
00:48:29.16 --> 00:48:35.96
Several days to complete we didn't know why we were having to build it it wasn't until we did our first walk through during our initial training

624
00:48:35.96 --> 00:48:37.96
That I realized how it would be used

625
00:48:38.36 --> 00:48:40.76
Even then we had no idea it was a

626
00:48:40.76 --> 00:48:52.36
Dimensionally perfect replica of all the buildings and walls of the POW camp in saante North Vietnam

627
00:48:52.76 --> 00:48:56.68
Two by four is whatever jam two by four is near the dirt and then build little buildings

628
00:48:57.24 --> 00:48:59.24
Full size walk-throughs

629
00:48:59.24 --> 00:49:01.72
It looked like toilet paper on

630
00:49:03.16 --> 00:49:04.68
wrapped on a

631
00:49:04.68 --> 00:49:13.40
Two before so it reminded me you know, but and one of the things we finally clarified in and the book was

632
00:49:13.80 --> 00:49:16.36
Everybody said we used to take it down every night

633
00:49:16.92 --> 00:49:21.40
Well, you know, it took us a week to build it and then we weren't gonna take that down every night

634
00:49:22.20 --> 00:49:25.000
Because they I mean we trained

635
00:49:25.72 --> 00:49:27.88
Most of our training was at night

636
00:49:28.92 --> 00:49:32.20
And so there's no way we could take it down and put it back up

637
00:49:32.20 --> 00:49:35.64
But and one of the air force guys that actually guarded it

638
00:49:36.44 --> 00:49:42.92
I said that confirmed that force in the book and we were trying to find out who can we talk to them

639
00:49:43.40 --> 00:49:47.16
And the air force guys said no, I said it was even up after you guys left

640
00:49:47.16 --> 00:49:50.12
But they did fly over it and take pictures

641
00:49:50.52 --> 00:49:52.92
Right so they wanted to confirm that the

642
00:49:53.80 --> 00:49:59.40
Whatever the Russians couldn't see it from satellites or from flyovers and aircraft or whatever exactly

643
00:49:59.40 --> 00:50:04.68
Yep, but but somebody hadn't started the rumor that it was so secret that you would take it down

644
00:50:04.68 --> 00:50:08.44
Yeah, all every day. Yeah, that's exactly right

645
00:50:11.08 --> 00:50:15.32
Fast forward a little bit talking about some of the training you do you were doing on Wednesday

646
00:50:15.32 --> 00:50:20.52
September 9th about a week after we arrived as the advance part of the other 78 or so green berets arrived

647
00:50:20.52 --> 00:50:28.44
That we started our training the first 30 days of training were intense each day started with PT followed by running the meadows mile

648
00:50:28.44 --> 00:50:35.16
Dick Meadows love to run and he led many many of our runs now I like to run but not like Captain Meadows

649
00:50:35.32 --> 00:50:41.16
If you were not in shape you soon would be I think this was one of the reasons I was selected as one of the Raiders

650
00:50:41.16 --> 00:50:48.60
I was by no means the biggest man in fact. I was the second shortest the shortest Raider was also the oldest NCO

651
00:50:49.16 --> 00:50:52.12
Master Sergeant Galen Papi Kittelsen

652
00:50:52.52 --> 00:50:54.52
Papi was no stranger to combat

653
00:50:54.52 --> 00:50:58.04
Papi and I had several things in common we were both short and stocky built

654
00:50:58.52 --> 00:51:01.88
We both grown up on a farm in the Midwest in World War II

655
00:51:02.20 --> 00:51:06.60
Papi was the youngest man in the raid on on the POW camp in the Philippines

656
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.92
I was the youngest man on this raid

657
00:51:08.92 --> 00:51:11.32
25 years junior to Papi

658
00:51:13.80 --> 00:51:19.16
That's pretty awesome so he's he's what 45 then because you're 20 right he's 45 years old

659
00:51:19.16 --> 00:51:24.36
Hmm and you're working with all these legends with all this combat experience and you know

660
00:51:25.48 --> 00:51:31.40
What's interesting to me was none of those guys ever let on like they were greater than anybody else

661
00:51:31.96 --> 00:51:37.64
I mean they were right there with us and if you had a question they answered for you and I mean they wanted to

662
00:51:38.36 --> 00:51:41.80
and I remember when we when we told the

663
00:51:41.80 --> 00:51:49.56
Packer bag we were leaving and we didn't have a at that time we didn't have a minister anything

664
00:51:49.56 --> 00:51:56.28
so Papi was a Christian and he said I'm gonna have a prayer service over in the building

665
00:51:56.28 --> 00:52:02.12
If you guys want to anybody must come come and what I walked in there I was amazed at how many of these guys

666
00:52:02.12 --> 00:52:07.48
I didn't think it's Pil God were there on their knees praying and

667
00:52:07.48 --> 00:52:13.80
And Papi was a lead miss and I'm made an impression on me that know that

668
00:52:14.68 --> 00:52:20.60
You're not in control of anything you just think you are and the man upstairs is the one in charge

669
00:52:21.48 --> 00:52:23.48
So

670
00:52:25.40 --> 00:52:30.84
Getting into some of this training you say our our training began with us walking through our positions

671
00:52:30.84 --> 00:52:33.48
Over and over again in daylight during the first month

672
00:52:33.48 --> 00:52:39.08
There were several changes to how we performed our mission each person had specific tasks to perform

673
00:52:39.40 --> 00:52:45.72
Not only do we have to know our own role, but we had to know the role of the man to our left and right and where they would be when the

674
00:52:45.72 --> 00:52:49.08
Firing started Captain Dan and I were a two-man team

675
00:52:49.64 --> 00:52:58.36
As the RTO for red blind security group my job as Captain Dan put it I want you at arms length for me or I will be the one to shoot you

676
00:52:58.36 --> 00:53:07.72
And if you knew Captain Dan he would have so you can bet I stayed damn close to him the primary job of our two-man team was to make our way to the

677
00:53:07.88 --> 00:53:14.84
Communications building as fast as we could to neutralize the people inside before they could radio for reinforcements

678
00:53:15.88 --> 00:53:19.32
We had two buildings to clear before we could get to the communication building

679
00:53:20.36 --> 00:53:24.20
The technique we use for clearing a building was different from what our troops used today

680
00:53:24.20 --> 00:53:28.36
As a two-man team we would first toss a concussion grenade into the building

681
00:53:28.84 --> 00:53:33.000
Why use a concussion grenade and not a frag grenade the answer is very simple

682
00:53:33.40 --> 00:53:37.40
The buildings were we were clearing of bad guys were not made of concrete

683
00:53:37.40 --> 00:53:40.92
But of a thin material that a piece of flood frag would fly through

684
00:53:41.16 --> 00:53:47.72
Captain Dan would stand to one side of the doorway and I would position myself on these other side across from him

685
00:53:47.72 --> 00:53:53.56
When the concussion grenade exploded it would generally blow the door open or in some cases

686
00:53:53.56 --> 00:53:56.76
Completely off as soon as the grenade exploded

687
00:53:56.76 --> 00:54:05.24
Captain Dan would dive to the floor at the threshold firing in the room from the top left to the bottom right at the same time

688
00:54:05.24 --> 00:54:07.24
I would step over him

689
00:54:07.24 --> 00:54:13.64
Firing top right to bottom left by this we created an X covering all the space in the room

690
00:54:13.96 --> 00:54:18.44
Captain Dan would remain on the floor and I would back out and shine my flashlight into the room

691
00:54:18.44 --> 00:54:21.88
So Captain Dan could confirm that we had neutralized everyone

692
00:54:21.88 --> 00:54:26.04
I would then put in a new clip depending on if I'd fired any trace around

693
00:54:26.28 --> 00:54:31.88
Captain Dan taught me that in combat you don't have to you don't have time to count how many bullets you fired

694
00:54:31.88 --> 00:54:38.04
The technique is to first load five trace around and then finish filling the magazine when you're in a firefight

695
00:54:38.04 --> 00:54:43.08
And you see trace or smoking out the end of your barrel you know you need to change magazines

696
00:54:46.60 --> 00:54:48.60
That's a wild way to clear rules

697
00:54:48.60 --> 00:54:54.76
And I got to make a note here so when you say concussion grenade so a lot of times like we

698
00:54:55.32 --> 00:55:00.84
What we use now we use something all the time called a a crash grenade or a flash grenade or a flashbang

699
00:55:02.04 --> 00:55:04.84
And those create a boom and a flash

700
00:55:05.72 --> 00:55:12.52
But a concussion grenade is big it's a different thing it's not the same as it's not the same as a flashbang at all

701
00:55:12.52 --> 00:55:20.92
It's a big in fact there they're a lot bigger than a frag grenade right they're they're really big and they create a massive explosion

702
00:55:21.16 --> 00:55:23.56
Now there's no fragmentation as you mentioned

703
00:55:24.52 --> 00:55:30.04
But it is a massive explosion and when you when that happens inside of a closed room

704
00:55:31.16 --> 00:55:34.12
You know even if the doors are the walls aren't that strong

705
00:55:34.12 --> 00:55:42.12
It's gonna create an issue and what did what did you think the walls were gonna be made of there in the camp?

706
00:55:42.12 --> 00:55:48.04
Well, we we anticipated being made just kind of like a patch, you know, maybe in Adobe

707
00:55:48.84 --> 00:55:51.48
The compound itself was kind of a brick wall

708
00:55:51.88 --> 00:55:59.88
But you know remember the French were in there before and we were there and they had built the compound

709
00:55:59.88 --> 00:56:09.72
But the buildings on the outside were in the doors were really on the far as the solid doors, you know, they were

710
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.36
Pretty flimsy so you so you toss a concussion grenade into the room

711
00:56:17.32 --> 00:56:18.36
Then

712
00:56:18.36 --> 00:56:22.36
Captain Dan dives to the floor in the doorway and

713
00:56:22.92 --> 00:56:27.96
Stunloads of magas, you know in full auto from the top left to the bottom right

714
00:56:27.96 --> 00:56:36.60
While you while he's doing that you straddle him in the doorway and fire a full mag on auto going top right to bottom left

715
00:56:36.60 --> 00:56:38.60
Yep, this is

716
00:56:38.60 --> 00:56:42.20
This is serious business. It was our own technique

717
00:56:43.88 --> 00:56:48.84
When we were trying to figure out how to best do it. This is Dan's idea

718
00:56:48.84 --> 00:56:54.44
Well, he said oh, he's a floor. You straddle me and you know and then when you're

719
00:56:54.44 --> 00:56:59.08
I'll fire this way you fire that away and we'll create a dex

720
00:56:59.72 --> 00:57:05.32
And hopefully that would put everybody down and they could see our mission was not to take P.O. devias

721
00:57:05.88 --> 00:57:09.24
And we had to go through that same area coming back and

722
00:57:09.80 --> 00:57:13.16
We had both Simon said I don't want anything holding us up

723
00:57:13.56 --> 00:57:20.52
So you neutralize everybody on the way through and that was our orders and that's what we did and you know

724
00:57:21.72 --> 00:57:23.72
the

725
00:57:23.72 --> 00:57:28.04
Our way of clearing a building is quite different in the way they cleared a day

726
00:57:28.60 --> 00:57:34.44
We didn't worry about collateral damage, you know, you were the bad guy and that's what it was gonna be

727
00:57:34.44 --> 00:57:36.44
So we made sure that

728
00:57:37.48 --> 00:57:40.68
We neutralized and moved on to the next building

729
00:57:41.32 --> 00:57:43.48
Now, were you worried about where you're

730
00:57:44.12 --> 00:57:46.84
What did you guys plan in such a way that your bullets

731
00:57:47.48 --> 00:57:51.000
That were going through this building that there was no friendlies on the other side

732
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.76
Did you guys have the whole thing kind of mapped out?

733
00:57:52.76 --> 00:57:58.68
Yeah, we would that friendly fire. Yeah, in fact even when the choppers came in it took out the guard towers

734
00:58:00.68 --> 00:58:04.20
We made sure that we were shooting into one of the

735
00:58:05.56 --> 00:58:10.12
cells of the P.O. devias in fact in order to do that

736
00:58:11.32 --> 00:58:18.84
One of the P.J. said, you know, he could fire and not hit the cell so what they did they put a

737
00:58:19.40 --> 00:58:21.40
a sheet up

738
00:58:21.40 --> 00:58:28.12
And tested and the guy did exactly what he said he did. Yeah, I mean it took out the guard tower

739
00:58:28.60 --> 00:58:31.72
But didn't have anything near close to the cells

740
00:58:32.52 --> 00:58:36.76
So when they when we flew in in live mode

741
00:58:36.76 --> 00:58:43.40
That's what they did to take out a couple of the towers and then there was one tower that we had

742
00:58:43.96 --> 00:58:48.20
The blue boy had to take out because it was in a situation when we didn't

743
00:58:48.20 --> 00:58:52.36
Confire into it and not think we might hit a P.O. devias

744
00:58:53.08 --> 00:58:58.44
So that's how we did things and it was

745
00:59:01.08 --> 00:59:06.52
It worked you know the only thing that was bad about it is the hearing that it

746
00:59:07.80 --> 00:59:12.76
Like you said those concussion grenades are brutal and we didn't

747
00:59:12.76 --> 00:59:17.80
I had a headset and I had my headset where one was on and one was off

748
00:59:18.68 --> 00:59:20.92
But you take your friend and your

749
00:59:22.28 --> 00:59:28.76
Hope that you could hear something after I came back and there's probably a good couple of months

750
00:59:28.76 --> 00:59:31.72
I was just in my hearing today is gone

751
00:59:32.68 --> 00:59:34.68
From and I

752
00:59:34.68 --> 00:59:36.68
Much of is from the

753
00:59:36.68 --> 00:59:42.20
Concussion grenades because I mean the idea the concussion is below your eyes not ears out

754
00:59:42.20 --> 00:59:45.24
Yeah, that's what it's supposed to do is blow people clear drums out

755
00:59:45.24 --> 00:59:47.24
Yeah, it does

756
00:59:48.92 --> 00:59:56.36
It's interesting because when I first got in the seal teams we we didn't have a very big budget and and some of the training that we would do

757
00:59:57.32 --> 01:00:00.28
For our kill houses that we would set up they were just made a plywood

758
01:00:00.92 --> 01:00:04.84
So it was actually harder in some ways because you had to be aware of

759
01:00:05.64 --> 01:00:11.72
Where everyone else was in the house or in the building because if you shot around into a target

760
01:00:11.72 --> 01:00:15.80
Or you missed the target and we would have built bullet traps sometimes we'd have bullet traps

761
01:00:15.80 --> 01:00:20.84
But a lot of times we would be just be suit and paper silhouette and so the bullet would go through the whole house

762
01:00:21.24 --> 01:00:24.52
Yeah, and so we had to organize these things that you were all

763
01:00:25.08 --> 01:00:30.84
Kind of staying online even as you move through a clearance of a building in order to be safe and and then

764
01:00:31.32 --> 01:00:35.08
Eventually we ended up getting really nice ballistic walls and then you get a lot

765
01:00:35.32 --> 01:00:38.20
It's a lot easier to do and luckily where were you're fighting in

766
01:00:38.20 --> 01:00:42.12
I rack most of the time you know it was it was concrete walls or whatever

767
01:00:42.52 --> 01:00:46.68
So you could you could actually shoot in rooms and you they wouldn't generally go through the walls

768
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.16
But it takes a different level of planning when you have to account for

769
01:00:52.28 --> 01:00:57.000
Your rounds just continuing down range even pass through you know the building that you're in

770
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.80
I mean the collateral damage on something like that could be pretty high if

771
01:01:02.60 --> 01:01:05.08
Yeah, I mean when I we got a

772
01:01:05.08 --> 01:01:11.16
Terry buck and Lieutenant Dan spray in 30 round bags if that if you don't if you don't have a good plan

773
01:01:11.32 --> 01:01:13.32
That's gonna you're gonna shoot your own people

774
01:01:13.32 --> 01:01:19.64
So you guys had to think through a lot of these things in a lot of detail and the good thing is where you were training was the same thing

775
01:01:19.64 --> 01:01:21.88
Wasn't like you were training a ballistic house you were shooting through

776
01:01:22.60 --> 01:01:25.24
You know just just whatever paper or whatever

777
01:01:27.56 --> 01:01:31.000
From all this training you put together life lesson three

778
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.92
You say in your work always be training and improving during the first month of our training

779
01:01:36.92 --> 01:01:40.12
There were several changes made to how we approached our positions

780
01:01:40.52 --> 01:01:45.40
I learned a very important lesson in vest timing time and training it pays off

781
01:01:45.72 --> 01:01:48.20
Just like a football team trains for the big game

782
01:01:48.44 --> 01:01:53.72
We were training for our big game the major difference our lives depended on how well we performed

783
01:01:54.12 --> 01:01:58.20
Training sometimes gets boring but when the bullets start flying in both directions

784
01:01:58.20 --> 01:02:04.68
You're sure glad that you know what is expected of you and your team members

785
01:02:06.68 --> 01:02:08.68
And you know

786
01:02:08.68 --> 01:02:10.68
That that probably

787
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Is one of the more

788
01:02:13.96 --> 01:02:16.68
Important messages that I think

789
01:02:17.40 --> 01:02:19.40
Could come out of this book because

790
01:02:21.80 --> 01:02:26.20
I think the training that we did saved our lives because we had

791
01:02:26.20 --> 01:02:30.20
I mean we had 177 rehearsals and

792
01:02:31.24 --> 01:02:34.92
Part of those were alternate you know like if red wine went down

793
01:02:35.24 --> 01:02:40.04
It was red wine alternate red wine greenly went down was alternate greenly

794
01:02:40.60 --> 01:02:42.60
Well, we were setting down

795
01:02:42.60 --> 01:02:49.32
That night in San Te and I'm listening on my radio and I'm here

796
01:02:49.88 --> 01:02:51.88
Alternate playing green

797
01:02:51.88 --> 01:02:56.84
And you think the plucker factor didn't jump up there because you just lost one third

798
01:02:56.84 --> 01:03:00.04
We'll get to it, but that at that moment you lost one third of your assault force

799
01:03:00.04 --> 01:03:08.84
But our training and the training that we did paid off in spades because we we knew how to react

800
01:03:08.84 --> 01:03:13.56
And it wasn't like oh now what do we do we know what to do we train for it and

801
01:03:15.24 --> 01:03:17.64
The planners of this Sunday

802
01:03:17.64 --> 01:03:23.08
Have done such an and matching job of thinking of all the different

803
01:03:24.44 --> 01:03:29.48
scenarios the only one they didn't think about it was the P on that he's not being there

804
01:03:30.12 --> 01:03:33.88
That was the one that we just I mean Florida everybody

805
01:03:33.88 --> 01:03:35.08
No, but

806
01:03:35.08 --> 01:03:41.48
Yeah, and even I thought through that and we'll get to the actual rate itself, but as much planning went into it

807
01:03:42.28 --> 01:03:46.28
And as much they tried to think of all the different scenarios that could take place

808
01:03:46.28 --> 01:03:49.24
Something happened that they didn't plan for which is

809
01:03:50.28 --> 01:03:52.28
Once it green leaf

810
01:03:52.28 --> 01:03:59.64
Came back to the target site so you had to do a link up which is one of the hardest things to do in a combat zone is linking up with friendly forces

811
01:03:59.64 --> 01:04:01.32
In fact, I think it's the hardest thing to do

812
01:04:01.72 --> 01:04:05.000
The hardest thing to do in combat is link up with friendly forces

813
01:04:05.80 --> 01:04:11.32
And they basically like they they got all just like we did anything in front of you was open game

814
01:04:11.32 --> 01:04:17.08
And you know we were and for a few minutes there it got pretty testy and

815
01:04:17.96 --> 01:04:23.80
You know I have to compliment some of the guys that were on green leaf, you know

816
01:04:23.80 --> 01:04:27.08
They they knew they were coming back in on a hot LZ

817
01:04:27.72 --> 01:04:29.72
But they also knew that you know

818
01:04:30.44 --> 01:04:35.40
There's friendly guys out front too and they had to restrain themselves

819
01:04:36.92 --> 01:04:38.92
It was a pretty good

820
01:04:38.92 --> 01:04:40.92
Yeah

821
01:04:40.92 --> 01:04:42.36
And they were coming from a firefight themselves

822
01:04:42.76 --> 01:04:51.72
So they got hot weapons there there amped up they hear you guys shooting 400 yards away and how they're landing the helicopters and and so it's a

823
01:04:51.96 --> 01:04:58.20
Testimate to the training not just to the rehearsal of hey, this is exactly what's gonna happen and here's the contingency plan

824
01:04:58.20 --> 01:05:00.20
But here's something that we didn't expect to happen

825
01:05:00.44 --> 01:05:07.20
But we still have the good standard operating procedures the presence of mine to make to make the right decisions and that's a testin

826
01:05:07.20 --> 01:05:12.88
It's all this training. Oh, it was I mean, and that's not that's when I speak to military groups today

827
01:05:12.88 --> 01:05:21.000
I said I know we all hate to train but I can tell you I am living proof that what they we trained on probably saved a bunch of lives

828
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
You know and

829
01:05:24.24 --> 01:05:26.24
Awesome life lesson

830
01:05:27.92 --> 01:05:32.40
Going back to the book you said is one of the six guys assigned to guard the tactical operations

831
01:05:32.40 --> 01:05:38.88
And I started to see that I might miss out on some of the key training if I wanted to have a chance to get in selected for one of the assault force teams

832
01:05:38.88 --> 01:05:41.12
I had to train when I was not pulling guard duty

833
01:05:41.36 --> 01:05:47.08
Security was so tight that we didn't know who we would be rescuing or in what part of the world the mission would take place

834
01:05:47.20 --> 01:05:51.04
There was a lot of speculation that it might be an attempt to free prisoners in Cuba

835
01:05:51.32 --> 01:05:53.92
Based on the three hour flying time of the mission

836
01:05:53.92 --> 01:05:58.44
I had been training and pulling guard duty for about a month when I got my chance to speak up

837
01:05:58.44 --> 01:06:01.16
I was checking Colonel Bill's whole Simon's

838
01:06:01.16 --> 01:06:07.16
For access to the talk building while we were waiting for an escort to take the bull in

839
01:06:07.52 --> 01:06:10.12
He asked how things were going for me

840
01:06:10.12 --> 01:06:14.64
I knew that he was only going to pick some of us for the actual mission

841
01:06:14.64 --> 01:06:16.52
So I said sir

842
01:06:16.52 --> 01:06:20.84
I didn't volunteer to come here and pull guard duty if I wanted to pull guard duty

843
01:06:20.84 --> 01:06:22.84
I would have stayed at Fort Bragg

844
01:06:23.44 --> 01:06:29.44
Now bull always had a two inch cigar that he chewed on he looked me right in the eyes and said young man hanging there

845
01:06:29.44 --> 01:06:33.80
Things are going to change pretty soon after that he went to the building. I thought to myself

846
01:06:33.80 --> 01:06:38.92
What the hell did I just do first I chewed out to him sergeant majors back at Fort Bragg trying to get on this mission

847
01:06:38.92 --> 01:06:43.92
Now I just told a Colonel and not just any Colonel but bull's Simon's that I was tired of pulling guard duty

848
01:06:43.92 --> 01:06:44.72
I

849
01:06:44.72 --> 01:06:48.000
Just bitched to the bull about pulling guard duty. I

850
01:06:48.52 --> 01:06:52.36
Thought well, I'll probably end up pulling guard duty for the rest of my time in the army

851
01:06:53.24 --> 01:06:57.16
However, what he said was true within the next week things did change

852
01:06:57.16 --> 01:07:00.84
The first cut was made on Friday, September 18th

853
01:07:00.84 --> 01:07:08.46
They selected 51 men and an additional 10 men were identified as backup that could be used in any of the different elements

854
01:07:08.46 --> 01:07:12.18
I was selected to be a part of the red wine security group

855
01:07:12.18 --> 01:07:17.26
I would be the RTO for Captain Dan Turner no more guard duty for me

856
01:07:17.26 --> 01:07:23.54
The three groups were each placed in their own areas in the barracks building to help the team concept

857
01:07:23.54 --> 01:07:27.70
You know what why do you think you got selected?

858
01:07:28.98 --> 01:07:30.18
I

859
01:07:30.18 --> 01:07:32.18
I said an email to Dan Turner

860
01:07:33.58 --> 01:07:38.86
Dan's passed away, but before he passed away. I sent him an email asking him that and

861
01:07:39.86 --> 01:07:47.70
He he said basically I didn't bitch about whatever I was asked to do and he said he always had a

862
01:07:47.70 --> 01:07:53.46
Great attitude that you know, I can do that and whether I could do it or not

863
01:07:54.74 --> 01:07:57.42
I took the attitude that I could get it done and

864
01:07:58.34 --> 01:08:04.06
He just felt like I I was older than the 20 year old that

865
01:08:04.38 --> 01:08:08.88
He was accustomed to so and I think that's

866
01:08:09.78 --> 01:08:13.62
Tributed to just growing up in a farm and you know

867
01:08:13.62 --> 01:08:15.62
you do things that

868
01:08:15.62 --> 01:08:19.42
You know I started driving a tractor I was six years old

869
01:08:19.78 --> 01:08:26.02
You know as you know was just I had to keep it between the bales a hey

870
01:08:26.46 --> 01:08:30.42
When we were picking up a and that was about it, you know, but that's

871
01:08:31.30 --> 01:08:37.18
You do things on farm back in those days that you wouldn't have thought about doing but

872
01:08:38.98 --> 01:08:44.66
That was I was confident that I could do the right job for him and

873
01:08:44.66 --> 01:08:46.66
Hopefully I did

874
01:08:48.14 --> 01:08:52.02
This also leads to another life lesson life lesson number four

875
01:08:52.02 --> 01:08:54.50
You say have patience and aggressiveness and

876
01:08:55.14 --> 01:09:01.08
Contentment guarding the talk we are not allowed to know the why as I saw my opportunity slipping away

877
01:09:01.08 --> 01:09:03.58
I was aggressive hungry to be in the middle of the action

878
01:09:03.58 --> 01:09:06.66
That's okay. It's not a fault to be aggressive. It's a virtue

879
01:09:06.66 --> 01:09:13.86
If you can choose in your heart and in your mind to be at peace and to be thankful trusting God with the outcome

880
01:09:15.22 --> 01:09:21.10
So you got to know we got to be patient at the same time. You know you know sometimes you got to approach the bull

881
01:09:21.10 --> 01:09:23.10
Yeah

882
01:09:23.10 --> 01:09:25.10
Yeah

883
01:09:25.10 --> 01:09:27.10
And he yeah

884
01:09:27.10 --> 01:09:30.74
I could tell he wasn't offended by it, you know, he just

885
01:09:30.74 --> 01:09:36.34
He asked the question I thought here's my opportunity to tell him, you know, if he's saying

886
01:09:36.34 --> 01:09:42.80
I'm just gotta go with it. I mean, that's what you're looking for when you're in charge of a team

887
01:09:42.80 --> 01:09:47.46
You want someone that wants to go that wants to step up and that's he's fresh any gave him for sure

888
01:09:48.86 --> 01:09:54.06
You say in our training at four bragg we used blanks, but for our training here at auxiliary field three

889
01:09:54.06 --> 01:09:56.78
We used live ammunition. I remember one day

890
01:09:56.78 --> 01:10:03.26
We were throwing frag grenades and one of the guys got hit with some shrapnel. There's only a minor cut, but it drove home the point that we needed to stay sharp

891
01:10:03.26 --> 01:10:08.50
By the end of the first month, we had practiced until every person knew not only his own position

892
01:10:08.50 --> 01:10:13.30
But also the job of every person around him and the alternate plans

893
01:10:14.06 --> 01:10:16.70
Then we started practicing at night

894
01:10:18.10 --> 01:10:20.94
This is a serious rehearsal's going on

895
01:10:20.94 --> 01:10:23.94
um

896
01:10:23.94 --> 01:10:31.46
You go on to say when we first started training using the helicopters the plan called for Captain Dan to be the first man off and for me to be the second

897
01:10:31.62 --> 01:10:36.34
Now I'd watched enough warm movies to know that the first man off any vehicle get killed

898
01:10:36.62 --> 01:10:39.70
For a couple of weeks we trained this way. I thought oh shit

899
01:10:39.70 --> 01:10:44.98
We aren't even gonna make it off the chopper. I can now admit that every time I stepped off the chopper

900
01:10:45.18 --> 01:10:49.18
The thought went through my mind of getting zapped before my foot even hit the ground

901
01:10:49.18 --> 01:10:55.62
Then after a few rehearsals the plan changed to wear Captain Dan and I would the last two off the chopper

902
01:10:55.62 --> 01:11:01.72
All of a sudden I thought damn now that I'm the last guy off the bad guys will have their sights locked on

903
01:11:01.72 --> 01:11:03.72
I will get nailed for sure

904
01:11:03.72 --> 01:11:10.10
eventually I had to admit that if the good Lord wants me he doesn't care from the first the last or the middle

905
01:11:10.30 --> 01:11:13.30
My maker is going to bring me home when it's my time

906
01:11:13.30 --> 01:11:17.86
That's a some good young pair of the way

907
01:11:19.22 --> 01:11:21.22
Either way you're getting shot

908
01:11:23.22 --> 01:11:28.22
You say life less and five and this is an important one be prepared for death

909
01:11:28.46 --> 01:11:31.82
Don't worry about it. You can't completely control it

910
01:11:32.34 --> 01:11:36.82
Make sure that the day you meet your maker is not the first time you've been introduced

911
01:11:36.82 --> 01:11:44.82
If you are prepared at all times you're free to live life fearless and that was your attitude

912
01:11:44.82 --> 01:11:48.78
Eventually you sat to say you know what weathering first weathering last if it's my time it's my time

913
01:11:48.78 --> 01:11:55.90
I can only control so much and you know that point was really driven home last week when my wife passed away that

914
01:11:56.58 --> 01:11:58.58
You know

915
01:11:58.58 --> 01:12:02.98
She she was prepared to meet her maker. I know that and

916
01:12:02.98 --> 01:12:10.86
She's in a better place today because of that so it holds true in my mind

917
01:12:16.18 --> 01:12:19.54
Well, I mean it's it's a testament when you can say that

918
01:12:20.02 --> 01:12:28.02
You know that your wife who lived an amazing life and and she passed away and you know we were talking before

919
01:12:28.02 --> 01:12:36.30
We we started that you said well, we're gonna come out here anyways. We're gonna record this thing because she would want me to carry on with the mission

920
01:12:41.30 --> 01:12:45.58
Yeah, that's it's an important part of the book, you know, and

921
01:12:46.02 --> 01:12:50.26
I think that I think that happens with young guys going into combat

922
01:12:51.14 --> 01:12:55.34
You have to get to a point where you say mail. You know what this could

923
01:12:55.34 --> 01:13:01.34
I could die tonight. Yeah, and but you could do that while I'm gonna cross the road could do that walk in across the road and

924
01:13:01.58 --> 01:13:04.22
You can only control the things you control you can train hard

925
01:13:04.58 --> 01:13:08.54
You can prepare you can study the plan you can mitigate the risk

926
01:13:08.54 --> 01:13:12.94
But there's some risk you're not gonna be able to mitigate right and if you concentrate on those things

927
01:13:13.18 --> 01:13:17.34
It's gonna drive you crazy. I'm gonna say it takes away from everything else. Yeah

928
01:13:18.34 --> 01:13:20.34
Exactly

929
01:13:20.34 --> 01:13:26.14
You talk more about some of the training that you did again. You got to buy the book to get all all the details

930
01:13:26.42 --> 01:13:33.02
You talk about some of the Friday night fights which was they would bring like a band and and

931
01:13:33.74 --> 01:13:39.82
Boozing women and they had like a bar set up and so you do that on Friday nights

932
01:13:39.82 --> 01:13:43.72
And again, it's crazy to think that you guys still didn't know where you were going

933
01:13:43.72 --> 01:13:47.06
You guys had no idea where you're going. You thought you might be going to Cuba

934
01:13:47.06 --> 01:13:52.70
I think there was somewhere else you thought you might be going to replace hijacked on tarmacs around the

935
01:13:52.70 --> 01:13:55.34
Camorole that we thought we might be going into

936
01:13:56.06 --> 01:14:01.18
Rescue you know people on hijacked planes, so you have no idea what you're doing

937
01:14:01.18 --> 01:14:08.20
No, which and everybody you know it was we didn't know we just knew we were gonna do some type of rescue and

938
01:14:09.14 --> 01:14:11.14
We trained

939
01:14:11.14 --> 01:14:14.34
Fort and did you know that it was real?

940
01:14:14.34 --> 01:14:16.34
So

941
01:14:16.02 --> 01:14:21.70
So no okay because I know sometimes we would get spun up in such a way where they'd be like

942
01:14:21.70 --> 01:14:26.26
Hey, we got a mission and we think actually this the very first deployment I went on

943
01:14:26.94 --> 01:14:29.70
We got recalled we had little beepers now

944
01:14:29.70 --> 01:14:34.14
I was in Guam and we had beepers and they said hey if this thing shows up nine one one

945
01:14:34.14 --> 01:14:38.22
You know you got 20 minutes to get to base because some's going on

946
01:14:39.02 --> 01:14:41.02
So we get there and I'm I'm

947
01:14:41.02 --> 01:14:44.06
I guess I'm 19 or 20 at this point

948
01:14:44.78 --> 01:14:50.86
Maybe I'm 20 or 21 but anyways, I'm young and very dumb and I also think that I'm you know

949
01:14:50.86 --> 01:14:57.30
I think I'm going to be at mom. You know, I think I'm I think I'm gonna be like the combination of James Bond and Rambo and everybody else

950
01:14:57.98 --> 01:15:01.98
So we show up in Guam on deployment my Pseal Patoon

951
01:15:02.38 --> 01:15:09.90
It's 1993 anyways, but I think there's just you know this is it

952
01:15:09.90 --> 01:15:16.62
We're gonna war hmm so we go out we get all we go out the range we get all of our weapons dialed in and I'm just

953
01:15:18.14 --> 01:15:20.86
Totally ready and then

954
01:15:23.74 --> 01:15:31.02
I'm doing something and I get that the 911 on my page and I hope there you go here it is it's on it's go time

955
01:15:31.02 --> 01:15:38.22
And we run you know rushing to back to base sitting our opportunity in space and my leading petty officer comes in and says

956
01:15:40.22 --> 01:15:42.74
Hey, they went and inspected the range we didn't do a good job

957
01:15:44.74 --> 01:15:46.74
We got to go clean up our brass

958
01:15:48.54 --> 01:15:50.54
So

959
01:15:51.10 --> 01:15:53.10
Not exactly what I anticipate

960
01:15:53.10 --> 01:16:01.34
But yeah, so you guys are doing this Friday night oh my point was that

961
01:16:02.54 --> 01:16:07.34
We would sometimes get recalled to do something and they wouldn't tell us it was training

962
01:16:08.06 --> 01:16:13.50
Until like we were ready to launch or and we some guys would know some guys

963
01:16:13.50 --> 01:16:17.74
Bego this is just training but of course I'd be like no way man. It's real. You know

964
01:16:17.74 --> 01:16:25.90
But you guys so did some of you think maybe this is just a big training operation and the beginning we kind into it

965
01:16:26.30 --> 01:16:33.66
But with bull being in charge and all the you know we saw a lot of

966
01:16:34.86 --> 01:16:42.06
Brass around us, you know this is the first mission ever to be in the direct control the joint chiefs of staff

967
01:16:42.06 --> 01:16:49.18
We didn't know that at the time either. I mean we we knew that there was guys in worshiping coming down

968
01:16:49.82 --> 01:16:53.90
Ever once a while and they would go into the building and we'd think why are they there?

969
01:16:54.38 --> 01:17:01.02
You know, but you know nobody ever explained to us that you know they were doing the same thing up in worshiping DC

970
01:17:01.98 --> 01:17:03.34
But

971
01:17:03.74 --> 01:17:05.74
It was

972
01:17:05.74 --> 01:17:12.54
We just kind of kept the dark and fed on bullshit and that's that's

973
01:17:13.10 --> 01:17:15.10
We started

974
01:17:16.46 --> 01:17:19.66
We were just told do our job. Yeah, that's what we were doing

975
01:17:21.02 --> 01:17:26.54
Speaking of Friday night fights you say there's one interesting incident that sticks in my mind

976
01:17:26.54 --> 01:17:30.86
Our barracks were two stories world were two style with one big open bay for all of us

977
01:17:30.86 --> 01:17:34.22
I was on the first floor and our beds were lined up on each side of the room

978
01:17:34.22 --> 01:17:39.66
It was about one thirty a.m. when I was awakened by crashing noises just four bumps down from mine

979
01:17:39.90 --> 01:17:47.02
It was three nco's wrestling a master sergeant to the floor in our barracks apparently the master sergeant after quite a few drinks

980
01:17:47.26 --> 01:17:50.06
Had a disagreement with bulls Simon's at the bar

981
01:17:50.06 --> 01:17:54.86
Concerning how the team should perform their mission and was frustrated that the troops were being kept in the dark

982
01:17:55.58 --> 01:18:00.62
The discussion got heated and the nco came back to his barracks to get his weapon to first sway the good

983
01:18:00.62 --> 01:18:06.78
Colonel to use his ideas the guys in the barracks held the nco until he eventually cooled down

984
01:18:07.02 --> 01:18:11.26
The next morning the bull and the nco were on the PT field the bull had the nco

985
01:18:11.66 --> 01:18:18.22
Heels locked at attention while he chewed his butt up one side and down the other the bull convinced him that he should not

986
01:18:18.22 --> 01:18:22.22
Disagree with him again at least not with a threat of bodily harm

987
01:18:23.50 --> 01:18:28.54
But the bull did not let this effect his relationship with the nco or anybody else the bull always said

988
01:18:28.54 --> 01:18:32.70
He didn't want a bunch of boy scouts. We always look forward to Friday night fights

989
01:18:33.18 --> 01:18:37.10
And this is classic the following entry was made into the official

990
01:18:37.50 --> 01:18:42.86
Talk record of events. I believe this is the very discussion with that master sergeant

991
01:18:42.86 --> 01:18:46.94
And so this is a quote from the actual record it says 27 October

992
01:18:47.90 --> 01:18:49.50
1715

993
01:18:49.50 --> 01:18:55.90
Colonel Simon's discussed grievances with operational personnel and discuss progress and quote

994
01:18:55.90 --> 01:18:57.90
Well

995
01:19:00.62 --> 01:19:02.62
Yeah, that was

996
01:19:03.18 --> 01:19:04.54
That was an interesting

997
01:19:04.54 --> 01:19:10.22
Evening and more and then the next day and we were we were all looking out the window thinking boy

998
01:19:10.22 --> 01:19:16.46
When you like be a little mouse here and with that conversation about but I mean it was over and

999
01:19:17.50 --> 01:19:19.50
He but on the mission with us and

1000
01:19:20.46 --> 01:19:21.66
He

1001
01:19:21.66 --> 01:19:27.82
But the bull said you know, he didn't want boy scouts. Yeah, he didn't have any so yeah, I know as a leader

1002
01:19:27.82 --> 01:19:31.42
You want to have guys that are gonna push back if they disagree with you because you might have a bad idea

1003
01:19:32.30 --> 01:19:35.82
Now you don't want them to go to their barracks and try and grab a weapon

1004
01:19:37.82 --> 01:19:40.30
But you do want to hear there

1005
01:19:40.62 --> 01:19:43.26
What they're gonna say and what why they think that? I know

1006
01:19:45.66 --> 01:19:47.66
Fast forward a little bit

1007
01:19:48.06 --> 01:19:49.42
Monday November 16th

1008
01:19:49.42 --> 01:19:51.42
1970

1009
01:19:51.42 --> 01:19:53.58
We were told the packard gear that we were leaving

1010
01:19:53.74 --> 01:19:57.02
Eglina Air Force Base for a new undisclosed location the next day

1011
01:19:57.02 --> 01:19:59.74
We didn't have a chaplain to our group in our group. We did have

1012
01:20:00.54 --> 01:20:03.98
Papy papy announced that he would be holding a prayer service in the barracks

1013
01:20:03.98 --> 01:20:07.50
Papy was respected by all the raiders and officers from the bull

1014
01:20:08.22 --> 01:20:13.50
Down the chain of command and World War II papy had been an alamo scout just like bull Simon's

1015
01:20:13.66 --> 01:20:17.50
They had both been on the raid that freed five hundred POWs

1016
01:20:17.50 --> 01:20:19.50
There's a

1017
01:20:19.50 --> 01:20:22.62
2005 major motion picture called the great raid

1018
01:20:22.94 --> 01:20:25.98
Papy was pretty famous in the army particular in special forces

1019
01:20:26.54 --> 01:20:31.82
When I walked into the barracks where Papy was holding the prayer service it really struck me how many of these seasoned

1020
01:20:32.54 --> 01:20:35.98
Soldiers were there to pray on their knees to our father and heaven

1021
01:20:35.98 --> 01:20:39.42
I can tell you there were no atheists in our group

1022
01:20:41.90 --> 01:20:44.86
The next morning you guys get on board us see 141

1023
01:20:44.86 --> 01:20:50.78
First place you land is California next place you land is Alaska and you still don't know where you're going

1024
01:20:50.78 --> 01:20:53.42
No, they still have not told you where you're going

1025
01:20:54.30 --> 01:20:57.34
The next stop would be our new home for a few days. It was a long flight

1026
01:20:57.34 --> 01:21:02.86
We didn't get much sleep, but at least we touched down at our final destination. It was November 18th at 3 a.m.

1027
01:21:03.34 --> 01:21:04.38
When we stopped

1028
01:21:04.70 --> 01:21:11.02
When we stepped off the C140 directly into a large hanger they loaded us into what what I thought were bread trucks

1029
01:21:11.02 --> 01:21:17.26
The air in this dark land had a sweet tropical smell warm and humid the old warriors thought we were in southeast Asia

1030
01:21:17.26 --> 01:21:18.54
But we're not certain

1031
01:21:18.70 --> 01:21:24.38
We never knew it until many years later, but this was the CIA compound at the tackling

1032
01:21:24.38 --> 01:21:25.34
Is it saying that right?

1033
01:21:25.34 --> 01:21:31.02
Tackly royal tie air force base when our trucks arrived at some barracks most of us went straight to bed

1034
01:21:31.02 --> 01:21:33.02
Our trip had taken 28 hours

1035
01:21:33.18 --> 01:21:35.18
So even know where you are

1036
01:21:35.18 --> 01:21:40.86
Some of the old timers are thinking hey, kind of smells like southeast Asia. That's about all I got

1037
01:21:43.42 --> 01:21:47.82
We were awakened at 6 a.m. had breakfast and went about our morning as normal

1038
01:21:47.82 --> 01:21:52.54
We were told to be at the mess hall to 11 a.m. a little earlier than normal lunch during lunch

1039
01:21:52.54 --> 01:21:56.14
We were told to go to our barracks immediately after we finished eating and get some sleep

1040
01:21:57.42 --> 01:22:04.70
To ensure we got some sleep lieutenant-cruel Joe Kataldo our doctor who would be going on the mission and into the compound with us

1041
01:22:04.70 --> 01:22:10.54
Required everyone of us to take a sleeping pill as we exited the mess hall as we walked toward the barracks the old timers

1042
01:22:10.54 --> 01:22:15.02
Explain that they had never had to do that before it was pretty clear that this would be the night

1043
01:22:15.90 --> 01:22:21.90
I spent the rest of the afternoon walking around the compound and talking to the other raiders about what they thought was going on

1044
01:22:21.98 --> 01:22:30.06
The time passed very slowly that afternoon by 5 p.m. everyone was awakened from our bunks and told to get to the mess hall for dinner

1045
01:22:30.30 --> 01:22:32.30
then meet in the theater in 1800

1046
01:22:32.30 --> 01:22:36.86
By 1730 we started filling the theater you could tell

1047
01:22:37.90 --> 01:22:41.10
Everyone was getting pumped for what we were about to learn

1048
01:22:43.42 --> 01:22:49.42
And this is where you get the the speech that I opened this whole thing up with where you finally find out

1049
01:22:50.46 --> 01:22:58.46
Where you're where you're actually going these are got no idea and that the way you write about that that reaction that everybody had

1050
01:22:58.46 --> 01:23:04.22
Mm-hmm. Would you say I mean I would imagine that all these other possible missions that you could be going on

1051
01:23:04.38 --> 01:23:06.38
There would be none more

1052
01:23:06.86 --> 01:23:07.90
Favorable

1053
01:23:07.90 --> 01:23:13.46
Then going to actually rescue other American and service members in Vietnam. I mean that's

1054
01:23:14.26 --> 01:23:17.82
That's the that's the pinnacle. Yeah, that's what we thought to

1055
01:23:18.46 --> 01:23:22.30
I mean we were ready to had they been there there been home that night

1056
01:23:22.30 --> 01:23:28.30
All 70 or more

1057
01:23:30.14 --> 01:23:32.14
So you get that speech

1058
01:23:32.70 --> 01:23:37.58
You say at 2100 the bread trucks took us to a hanger that we used as our staging area

1059
01:23:37.58 --> 01:23:45.50
We checked our weapons. I carried a cult m1911 a 45 caliber pistol my machine gun was a car 15 with 820 round magazines and

1060
01:23:45.90 --> 01:23:47.90
530 round magazines

1061
01:23:47.90 --> 01:23:53.18
I used the tips I'd learned from Captain Dan on how I should load my magazines. I strapped on two

1062
01:23:53.50 --> 01:23:55.66
Frag grenades and 10 concussion grenades

1063
01:23:56.54 --> 01:24:00.86
Captain Dan told me that if we ended up needing to use frags well, we were probably in some deep shit

1064
01:24:00.86 --> 01:24:02.86
So I hope that did not have to use them

1065
01:24:03.26 --> 01:24:08.70
We use the concussion grenades and clear in clearing the buildings my next task was to check the batteries on both my radios

1066
01:24:08.70 --> 01:24:12.62
I checked my handset and my headset on my prick 25

1067
01:24:12.62 --> 01:24:18.70
That's the way we were we were to communicate with Lieutenant Colonel Sidner's ground command team the headset

1068
01:24:18.70 --> 01:24:22.46
allowed me to listen to the radio traffic and still fire my weapon and toss grenades

1069
01:24:23.26 --> 01:24:26.54
each radar carried a survival radio a prick 90

1070
01:24:27.10 --> 01:24:33.98
When you turn on these radios they send out a warble tone that allows saw or search and rescue team to pull you out of a hot situation

1071
01:24:33.98 --> 01:24:42.86
Among the 56 radar radars we had 92 radios

1072
01:24:42.86 --> 01:24:44.86
So you're getting your gear ready

1073
01:24:46.86 --> 01:24:51.10
And you go through some you get it's pretty cool and here you know for people that are going to get the book which I'm sure is a lot

1074
01:24:51.98 --> 01:24:57.82
You go through like a gear list of absolutely everything that you're carrying every all the specialty gear that you had

1075
01:24:57.82 --> 01:25:03.50
Change saws the guys were carrying welder

1076
01:25:04.14 --> 01:25:08.86
That's a large welder which even though despite your incredible welding skills you didn't get aside

1077
01:25:10.14 --> 01:25:12.14
Decided to somebody else tiny

1078
01:25:14.14 --> 01:25:17.18
Probably about six to six three

1079
01:25:17.74 --> 01:25:21.58
He could I was pretty easy but nobody wanted me around tiny

1080
01:25:21.58 --> 01:25:25.26
Good shot. He those tanks get shot. It's gonna be a disaster

1081
01:25:27.98 --> 01:25:35.74
Time to go see 130 landed at you doing at 2300 ushered out you guys are ushered out to your age age 53 choppers

1082
01:25:37.66 --> 01:25:42.30
And here we go at 2317 with all the green berets aboard Apple to lift it off

1083
01:25:42.54 --> 01:25:48.30
Forming up with the other five helicopters and lime one and lime two the four engine c 130

1084
01:25:48.30 --> 01:25:56.86
Hercules tankers that would take us to the border of North Vietnam during our training we had only made the full three hour long flight twice

1085
01:25:57.26 --> 01:26:04.62
The idea I think was to keep us from trying to figure out what we might be going what I remember about that night was how hot it was and

1086
01:26:05.34 --> 01:26:07.34
And at the sky was very clear

1087
01:26:08.94 --> 01:26:13.26
On that long chopper flight from you don't to sauntay. I spent a lot of time in prayer

1088
01:26:13.26 --> 01:26:21.50
You can learn a little bit about yourself seeing what your mind latches onto when you know that in a few hours you might be meeting your maker

1089
01:26:23.10 --> 01:26:29.10
God has an important port. God has been important part of my life as long as I can remember my mother side of the family attended church

1090
01:26:29.10 --> 01:26:35.74
Pretty regularly compared to my dad's side the bucklers like to drink dance and party not to say they don't believe in God

1091
01:26:35.74 --> 01:26:37.74
They just like to celebrate a little bit more

1092
01:26:37.74 --> 01:26:44.78
After about an hour of flying most of the guys were lying back against the sides of the chopper some guys had their eyes closed

1093
01:26:44.78 --> 01:26:52.46
Either praying or sleeping. I thought to myself these men are true warriors many of the raiders were married some had kids my age or older

1094
01:26:52.86 --> 01:26:57.34
There was a lot of small talk. I figured each man was thinking there was not a lot of small talk

1095
01:26:57.34 --> 01:27:01.50
I figured each man was thinking of his family each one knew the risk he was taking

1096
01:27:01.74 --> 01:27:04.54
We were no different than other warriors before us our

1097
01:27:04.54 --> 01:27:09.26
Military is filled with men and women who are willing to risk their life to protect this great country

1098
01:27:09.90 --> 01:27:15.82
I sat back and had a nice little talk with the big man upstairs. I asked him protect to protect us tonight

1099
01:27:16.86 --> 01:27:23.66
It was the longest three hours. I had ever experienced I thought about my mom and dad and how they would feel if I didn't make it back

1100
01:27:23.66 --> 01:27:28.06
I wondered what they would think when they read the letter I had written to them before I left

1101
01:27:28.06 --> 01:27:32.94
I thought about what my dad told me before I left for the army don't volunteer for anything

1102
01:27:32.94 --> 01:27:38.22
So what did I do? I volunteered for airborne than special forces and now for this raid

1103
01:27:39.50 --> 01:27:43.50
I thought mom and dad would be heading to moose lodge this weekend for a Saturday outing

1104
01:27:43.50 --> 01:27:47.74
I thought about Doug my oldest brother who served in the Navy submarines for nine years

1105
01:27:47.82 --> 01:27:52.14
I thought about how my brothers and I fought and the crazy things we had done on the farm

1106
01:27:52.14 --> 01:27:56.94
I thought about the times I hunted squirrels with dad. I fought back to the first squirrel I killed

1107
01:27:56.94 --> 01:28:03.98
I'd shot him about nine times and when dad and I were scanning it he said we might get lead poisoning when we eat this one

1108
01:28:04.94 --> 01:28:10.22
I thought about my buddy Charlie caught him and the fun we had as kids I fought back to the times

1109
01:28:10.22 --> 01:28:15.82
Mike and I spent riding our horses into the woods around our farms. I guess I was trying to take my mind off the mission

1110
01:28:16.86 --> 01:28:23.02
Because I couldn't stop mentally rehearsing my duties for the mission over and over and over

1111
01:28:23.02 --> 01:28:29.34
I got up to stretch my legs and look out the window. I would could see the other choppers in the moonlight

1112
01:28:29.34 --> 01:28:34.54
It was like we were doing just another rehearsal so prepared we were

1113
01:28:35.74 --> 01:28:43.98
But this was the live run we are actually going in I sat back down and said another prayer for us and waited for us to arrive at Sonte

1114
01:28:43.98 --> 01:28:53.98
North Vietnam

1115
01:28:54.22 --> 01:28:59.90
It's a long flight that's a long flight to be sitting there thinking about this target that you're going into

1116
01:28:59.90 --> 01:29:01.90
Yep, it certainly was

1117
01:29:02.54 --> 01:29:05.98
Were you and there's so many details in this book that I'm not covering

1118
01:29:05.98 --> 01:29:16.30
Because I don't want to read the entire book but how well aware were you of the possibility of surface to air missiles?

1119
01:29:17.66 --> 01:29:24.46
Well, we knew they had brought several of our pilots down but we weren't

1120
01:29:25.82 --> 01:29:31.34
That wasn't on our mind you know we were grunts on the ground so that didn't you know

1121
01:29:31.34 --> 01:29:38.78
Sam's done fact us until we had one fire that has we realized just how damn

1122
01:29:39.74 --> 01:29:46.86
Closing God so you guys were blessed with a little bit of or at least you were of being a little bit naive

1123
01:29:46.86 --> 01:29:51.50
Yes, and and I know that we've we've lost a lot of our

1124
01:29:51.98 --> 01:29:53.10
naive

1125
01:29:53.10 --> 01:29:56.70
Attitude about helicopters because we've we've taken some some

1126
01:29:56.70 --> 01:30:03.02
horrific hits in helicopters and lost a ton of incredibly great people

1127
01:30:03.82 --> 01:30:13.98
But but for you guys you weren't really thinking about that too much and you knew we we knew we had air cover with the A1Es

1128
01:30:14.94 --> 01:30:20.86
And you know we had A1E flying over us all the time when we were on the compound

1129
01:30:20.86 --> 01:30:30.38
So the bridge we were supposed to blow it because of the alternate we didn't blow it but the A1E took out

1130
01:30:31.50 --> 01:30:33.50
The bridge force and so

1131
01:30:34.14 --> 01:30:40.78
We knew we had good cover there and then of course we weren't that aware of what was going on at the same time

1132
01:30:42.06 --> 01:30:47.18
From the Gulf of Tauk and you know there's a hundred sixty necraph coming in which

1133
01:30:47.18 --> 01:30:49.18
I mean that's

1134
01:30:50.30 --> 01:30:54.62
The largest array and Vietnam history did they brief you guys on any that no

1135
01:30:55.34 --> 01:31:01.58
We had no idea about it till we got back because they had basically set up a massive diversionary operation

1136
01:31:01.58 --> 01:31:09.10
Yes, on the other side of Hanoi right to to distract from what you guys were and I and I think it really worked if you

1137
01:31:09.74 --> 01:31:12.70
You know some of the after action reports that that came back

1138
01:31:12.70 --> 01:31:19.90
Said that you know some of the and the mixed in him could off the ground because they were confused as

1139
01:31:20.54 --> 01:31:29.42
Where they were coming from and you know we were dropping flares over Hanoi and while we were sneaking into backside

1140
01:31:30.46 --> 01:31:37.10
To San Tei so all their attention was coming from the Gulf of Tauk and and

1141
01:31:37.10 --> 01:31:46.06
There was a Sam site just south of us and any aircraft as well. I mean I think we had a total of 20 Sam's fire status at

1142
01:31:46.86 --> 01:31:48.38
night and

1143
01:31:48.38 --> 01:31:52.70
What up the first one the first and the only one I really remember

1144
01:31:53.42 --> 01:31:59.18
Was the one when we we had landed done our deal and we were coming out and

1145
01:32:00.38 --> 01:32:05.66
We got on the bird and we our count was off

1146
01:32:05.66 --> 01:32:09.02
You know, so we did another count

1147
01:32:09.42 --> 01:32:16.06
It was still off and then so we did a third count and this time Dan Turner counted himself

1148
01:32:17.34 --> 01:32:21.66
Which was kind of in the excitement I guess you know, but

1149
01:32:22.30 --> 01:32:24.30
Anyways, so we we got up we

1150
01:32:25.34 --> 01:32:32.70
We were setting the PJ between us and Dan and I were on both sides of the tail as we were leaving North Vietnam and

1151
01:32:32.70 --> 01:32:34.70
And the

1152
01:32:35.82 --> 01:32:42.94
Chopper is it turned and we were looking over the lights of Hanoi just like you'd be looking over the lights here in San Diego

1153
01:32:42.94 --> 01:32:47.98
I mean couldn't believe how big it was and then we were

1154
01:32:48.54 --> 01:32:54.06
Fly and we thought well we got it made you know we're back on the boat and we're head-nome in about that time

1155
01:32:54.06 --> 01:33:01.42
Our chopper just dropped and we thought oh we got hit or something and about that time big

1156
01:33:04.22 --> 01:33:11.50
Look like a light pole flying up our rear and it probably missed us by I would say no more than 200 meters

1157
01:33:12.14 --> 01:33:14.78
It was I mean it was close and

1158
01:33:15.66 --> 01:33:20.06
Of course our pilots we had the very best pilots the Air Force had those guys

1159
01:33:20.06 --> 01:33:25.10
That's where they they did a fantastic job of getting us in getting us out and

1160
01:33:26.46 --> 01:33:33.66
It was it was a bit that's where that's where I really got scared honestly because you know

1161
01:33:34.30 --> 01:33:37.58
I kind of had control of everything on the ground but when you're up there

1162
01:33:38.06 --> 01:33:44.86
That's pilots man. I have a lot of respect for those guys. They're sitting ducks and and you know they

1163
01:33:44.86 --> 01:33:49.66
And we lost one none of the choppers but one the

1164
01:33:50.62 --> 01:33:51.90
Jets

1165
01:33:51.90 --> 01:33:54.54
Was taken out by that night

1166
01:33:55.10 --> 01:33:58.30
But the pilots were recover the next morning, so

1167
01:33:59.18 --> 01:34:01.58
But just shows you how quick it can happen

1168
01:34:03.74 --> 01:34:07.42
As you're going in or you think and what are you thinking your chances are?

1169
01:34:09.26 --> 01:34:11.26
You know

1170
01:34:11.26 --> 01:34:13.26
my thoughts were

1171
01:34:13.26 --> 01:34:18.22
Okay, the good Lord is with me and with us and

1172
01:34:19.26 --> 01:34:23.98
We're gonna be all right, but I got to do my day and whatever it takes, you know

1173
01:34:24.62 --> 01:34:30.78
One of my biggest fears was what I freeze you know having never been in combat

1174
01:34:31.42 --> 01:34:35.02
You know, I mean I've heard of guys that've been in combat before freezing

1175
01:34:35.90 --> 01:34:37.90
Even guys that've been in for a long time

1176
01:34:37.90 --> 01:34:45.26
You know, but that was a concern of mine what I'd be able to but all the old timers kept coming up to him and said don't hesitate

1177
01:34:45.98 --> 01:34:51.10
Don't have a safety whatever you do it on hesitate was there anyone else that had no combat experience

1178
01:34:51.10 --> 01:34:53.82
So there was four of us had never been in combat before

1179
01:34:54.70 --> 01:34:59.34
hell and how many out of 56 four of us

1180
01:35:00.46 --> 01:35:05.02
Never been in combat so it was that I hope any experience and

1181
01:35:05.02 --> 01:35:09.82
They entered or told me in one time afterwards

1182
01:35:09.82 --> 01:35:13.26
He's just he's all more combat not saw in a year and

1183
01:35:14.62 --> 01:35:16.62
Is it really? Oh, yeah

1184
01:35:16.94 --> 01:35:18.94
so

1185
01:35:20.94 --> 01:35:23.18
So here we go

1186
01:35:24.54 --> 01:35:29.02
0 to 20 Saturday November 21st 1970

1187
01:35:29.02 --> 01:35:36.54
When we were just about to land I heard through the chatter in my headset the voice of Sergeant first class how

1188
01:35:36.54 --> 01:35:43.02
Came through he was the RTO for Lieutenant Colonel Sidner the ground force commander for the raid

1189
01:35:43.82 --> 01:35:48.78
Alternate planned green. I repeat alternate planned green do you copy?

1190
01:35:49.98 --> 01:35:53.74
This was only the first of the bad news I would hear tonight

1191
01:35:54.46 --> 01:35:56.46
I responded say again

1192
01:35:56.46 --> 01:36:02.22
Sergeant first class how alternate planned green alternate planned green over

1193
01:36:02.78 --> 01:36:07.02
I said back into my hand mic Roger alternate planned green over

1194
01:36:08.06 --> 01:36:10.70
I thought to myself holy crap this can't be real

1195
01:36:11.02 --> 01:36:17.26
I turned to Captain Dan and told him we were going to alternate planned green captain Dan gave me that oh shit look

1196
01:36:17.58 --> 01:36:21.50
And calmly told me to pass the announcement onto others in red wine

1197
01:36:21.50 --> 01:36:26.78
alternate planned green meant one thing to all of us on the red wine chopper

1198
01:36:27.02 --> 01:36:32.14
We knew that we had 22 fewer men there would be a lot less fire powers we hit the ground

1199
01:36:32.14 --> 01:36:36.46
Whether green leaf group had mechanical problems or had been shot down we knew the mission

1200
01:36:36.62 --> 01:36:41.58
Including the alternate plans with that with or without the 22 men of green leaf group

1201
01:36:41.58 --> 01:36:47.42
We were going to execute the mission and would now have to perform their role as well as ours

1202
01:36:47.74 --> 01:36:50.86
So what had happened here and again you go into these details in the book

1203
01:36:50.86 --> 01:36:57.50
But green leaf this one other chopper had landed in the wrong spot

1204
01:36:58.38 --> 01:37:00.70
There was a school yard that was

1205
01:37:01.02 --> 01:37:08.46
400 yards to the south and it looked kind of like the POW camp like a little school compound right and that's where they landed

1206
01:37:11.34 --> 01:37:14.86
The Colonel Colonel Bull Simon was with them yes

1207
01:37:14.86 --> 01:37:20.54
So you get this call that hey we're going we're still going there in the wrong spot

1208
01:37:20.54 --> 01:37:25.26
But we're still going you still need to execute the mission and this is where you have life less number six

1209
01:37:25.26 --> 01:37:27.26
Don't be indispensable

1210
01:37:27.26 --> 01:37:32.38
Always be training a backup person for your job and always be learning to be a backup for your teammates

1211
01:37:32.70 --> 01:37:37.18
This applies to any job in life the graveyards are full of indispensable men

1212
01:37:37.18 --> 01:37:43.50
But yeah, that's a sketchy situation

1213
01:37:43.50 --> 01:37:47.90
I don't think I won third the troops and as this is happening

1214
01:37:47.90 --> 01:37:53.10
I'm going back to the book at that moment the minigun and the door to our right fired off a few hundred rounds for those

1215
01:37:53.10 --> 01:37:58.22
You not familiar the minigun. It's a gun that fires 4,000 rounds of ammo permitted at his been

1216
01:37:59.02 --> 01:38:04.78
It is electronically driven rotary breach to feed the ammo belt at lightning speed

1217
01:38:04.78 --> 01:38:10.06
Now my heart was already pounding, but the sound of that minigun firing two feet for me really took me to a new level

1218
01:38:10.06 --> 01:38:15.26
I just my headset on the prick 25 on my back and feel for my ammo pound pouches

1219
01:38:15.26 --> 01:38:17.42
I check for frags in my concussion grenades

1220
01:38:17.42 --> 01:38:23.26
I place my finger on the safety and make sure I have the safety off and my car 15 is set on auto

1221
01:38:23.58 --> 01:38:29.02
I make sure to have the 30 round magazine well seated and I chamber around in training

1222
01:38:29.02 --> 01:38:30.54
I've done this a hundred times

1223
01:38:30.86 --> 01:38:32.86
But this is it

1224
01:38:32.86 --> 01:38:37.58
My first time in combat. This is no game. I'm not as scared as much as I am excited

1225
01:38:37.74 --> 01:38:40.78
This is the moment I have trained for the reason I joined the green berets

1226
01:38:40.78 --> 01:38:48.06
I don't I can't let Captain Dan down or the other raiders as the RTO for the red wine security group

1227
01:38:48.06 --> 01:38:50.14
My job is to stay close to Captain Dan

1228
01:38:50.22 --> 01:38:54.22
He's the commander of red wine and I am expected to protect his backside

1229
01:38:54.70 --> 01:38:58.14
The tailgate is lowered the choppers feathering to the ground

1230
01:38:58.22 --> 01:39:02.38
We are about to touch down on the enemies home land and there's no rescuing us

1231
01:39:02.38 --> 01:39:07.58
If there has been a security breach. I feel the chopper settle as it is done so many times in training

1232
01:39:07.90 --> 01:39:12.22
Red wine group is unloading exactly as we have practiced over 170 times

1233
01:39:12.46 --> 01:39:16.94
The major difference is that this time the bullets are flying in both directions

1234
01:39:17.74 --> 01:39:20.38
It is amazing how fast you can exit a chopper

1235
01:39:20.78 --> 01:39:27.10
Captain Dan and I start off the tail of the chapter the last two men off. I am literally one step to his right side as we run

1236
01:39:27.10 --> 01:39:33.58
Our boots have just started splashing the rice patties with a North Vietnamese army soldier fires at us from the very building

1237
01:39:33.58 --> 01:39:39.90
We were to clear a couple of bullets zip by us a natural reaction. I placed the green dot from my

1238
01:39:40.06 --> 01:39:43.34
Armolite single point site on the guards chest and fire three rounds

1239
01:39:43.58 --> 01:39:49.90
He immediately falls to the ground and that instant I don't hesitate what the season warriors taught me really paid off

1240
01:39:50.46 --> 01:39:52.46
Don't hesitate

1241
01:39:52.46 --> 01:39:54.46
I imagine most of the warriors

1242
01:39:54.46 --> 01:40:02.38
In your first time downrange wondering the back of your mind how you responded that moment what I freeze when I faced with the

1243
01:40:02.54 --> 01:40:07.98
Decision to kill or be killed I had only just stepped on to the enemies ground and I had my first kill

1244
01:40:08.54 --> 01:40:11.18
There'd be more to come as we cleared the buildings

1245
01:40:14.54 --> 01:40:16.54
Out of the gate

1246
01:40:16.54 --> 01:40:18.54
You know, I watch a lot of

1247
01:40:19.50 --> 01:40:22.30
Fighting and they always talk about you know

1248
01:40:22.30 --> 01:40:25.90
Who's got the fastest record knockout in a fight?

1249
01:40:27.50 --> 01:40:33.02
You might have the fastest kill on enemy territory that you step off for your immediately engaging your guy

1250
01:40:33.82 --> 01:40:35.82
That's kind of crazy to think about

1251
01:40:41.50 --> 01:40:45.74
You go on captain Dan thanks me as we charge towards our first building

1252
01:40:45.74 --> 01:40:51.10
I am following captain Dan with bullets blazing and men moving to their positions alternate playing green is proceeding

1253
01:40:51.10 --> 01:40:59.34
We hear our chopper apple to loudly lift off the rice patties to wait about a mile away until they're called back in to take us home with the POWs

1254
01:40:59.34 --> 01:41:06.14
We came to free and the back of our minds if these birds get battled damage it will be a long way back to friendly lines

1255
01:41:06.30 --> 01:41:08.30
No time to think about that

1256
01:41:08.54 --> 01:41:13.34
We move forward to clear our designated buildings nearest nearest to us

1257
01:41:13.90 --> 01:41:18.62
Master Sergeant Joe Lupiak and his red wine element two which includes him

1258
01:41:18.62 --> 01:41:26.54
Sergeant first class tyrone Adderley and Sergeant first class Billy Martin each of us knew this was going to be much more difficult than it was during training

1259
01:41:26.70 --> 01:41:31.98
These are buildings that green leaf group would have neutralized according to the original plan and they would have had

1260
01:41:32.46 --> 01:41:34.46
14 of their men on this task

1261
01:41:35.34 --> 01:41:37.10
Under alternate planned green

1262
01:41:37.34 --> 01:41:39.90
Five of our team were now going to have to do it

1263
01:41:40.38 --> 01:41:42.38
They also had more firepower

1264
01:41:42.38 --> 01:41:49.18
Sergeant first class Jake Jack Avanko was carrying an M60 by pod machine gun which we don't have on our team

1265
01:41:50.06 --> 01:41:55.66
What we did still have was the L on a surprise bull Simon's told us if there was security leak

1266
01:41:55.90 --> 01:41:58.54
We would know it by the time the second chopper landed

1267
01:41:59.10 --> 01:42:04.06
We turned out to be that second chopper and we are operating like a well-oiled machine

1268
01:42:04.86 --> 01:42:11.02
Captain Dan is redirecting our red wine group comprised of four elements and it is made and is making sure

1269
01:42:11.02 --> 01:42:13.02
We are getting the job done

1270
01:42:14.14 --> 01:42:19.66
As as a virgin to combat and as Captain Dan's RTO I stay close to him

1271
01:42:19.74 --> 01:42:25.58
You have to respect and trust the men with whom you go to battle. This is where the months of training play pay off

1272
01:42:26.14 --> 01:42:32.22
We know what we have to do next alternate plan green means that the bridge north of the POW camp will remain

1273
01:42:32.30 --> 01:42:37.90
Open to enemy reinforcements crossing it since we didn't have enough raiders to send someone to blow it

1274
01:42:37.90 --> 01:42:41.90
Over the radio is lieutenant Colonel Sidner directs the A1E

1275
01:42:42.22 --> 01:42:49.66
Skyrader pilots to light it up with rock eye missiles if anyone tries to cross at the A1s will open up with 20 millimeter cannon

1276
01:42:49.98 --> 01:42:53.34
Those fly boys are cocky but damn they're good at their job

1277
01:42:54.62 --> 01:43:01.82
What amazes me is that in all this chaos the only one of the only one green beret gets wounded

1278
01:43:01.82 --> 01:43:08.38
That is sergeant first class Joe Murray Joe is a member of master sergeant Herman Spencer's team

1279
01:43:09.42 --> 01:43:13.98
Whose job is it is to secure the area south of the south wall?

1280
01:43:14.54 --> 01:43:19.90
That's the wall closest to where the helicopter's drops dropped us off and we later pick us up

1281
01:43:20.38 --> 01:43:25.58
Master sergeant Spencer's carrying a 40 pound block of sea four explosives slung over his shoulder

1282
01:43:25.98 --> 01:43:27.98
It is to be used to blow the bridge

1283
01:43:27.98 --> 01:43:33.02
It turned out to be a good shield for him as we landed and spilled out of our helicopters

1284
01:43:33.18 --> 01:43:37.50
Spencer and Murray immediately rushed towards their objective the guard shack by the south wall

1285
01:43:37.82 --> 01:43:44.38
Spencer took a couple rounds from a guard with an AK 47 in the block of sea four he was carrying

1286
01:43:45.50 --> 01:43:49.02
Joe Murray would not be that lucky and that's something that surprises people is that

1287
01:43:49.58 --> 01:43:51.58
C4 is relatively stable

1288
01:43:51.98 --> 01:43:53.98
When it's when it's by itself

1289
01:43:53.98 --> 01:44:01.34
Right that's where you have blasting caps or detonation cord because those things will blow up and then they make the sea four blow up

1290
01:44:01.34 --> 01:44:05.02
But but C4 by itself is relatively stable

1291
01:44:05.74 --> 01:44:07.74
yeah

1292
01:44:08.14 --> 01:44:16.06
Back to the book when Spencer was dealing with that guard that delayed Spencer just such that Joe arrives at the guard shack alone

1293
01:44:16.06 --> 01:44:20.54
The building needs to be cleared immediately before the enemy troops inside can all emerge

1294
01:44:20.54 --> 01:44:25.82
So Joe decides to use a frag grenade instead of a concussion grenade as he is about to toss in the window

1295
01:44:25.82 --> 01:44:28.94
He feels his leg push forward with a burning sensation

1296
01:44:29.18 --> 01:44:32.38
Joe tosses the frag grenade in neutralizing the guard shack

1297
01:44:32.62 --> 01:44:37.26
He then turns to eliminate the threat Spencer now arriving fires his machine gun

1298
01:44:37.74 --> 01:44:39.74
First and eliminates three guards

1299
01:44:40.54 --> 01:44:43.34
Joe is the only army raider to receive a purple heart

1300
01:44:46.38 --> 01:44:48.38
That's crazy

1301
01:44:48.38 --> 01:44:53.74
And there's like is there just a massive amount of gun fire at this point?

1302
01:44:53.74 --> 01:44:55.74
Yeah, yeah, it's

1303
01:44:56.54 --> 01:45:02.38
Everybody's letting loose with everything and we got you know and you have one guy get hit in the leg

1304
01:45:02.38 --> 01:45:04.38
Yeah

1305
01:45:04.38 --> 01:45:06.38
Back to the leg

1306
01:45:08.62 --> 01:45:15.82
Going on for Captain Dan and me the objective is to get to the communication buildings as fast as possible to prevent that from calling for reinforcements

1307
01:45:15.82 --> 01:45:19.74
It's a good 50 meters ahead of us and it's an open area with no cover

1308
01:45:20.06 --> 01:45:23.18
We have two buildings to clear before we clear the communications building

1309
01:45:23.18 --> 01:45:28.62
We were told that we would not take any North Vietnamese army prisoners and neutralize everyone

1310
01:45:29.58 --> 01:45:34.54
We will be coming back through the same area and bulldoze it won't anyone preventing us from getting back to the choppers

1311
01:45:34.78 --> 01:45:39.50
To do this we have to ensure that there is no one alive to ambush us on our way back

1312
01:45:40.94 --> 01:45:43.82
Captain Dan and our getting closer to the communications building

1313
01:45:43.82 --> 01:45:47.10
We can see the main guard houses on fire and people are running away from us

1314
01:45:47.50 --> 01:45:52.54
Clearing the main guard house was the job of another red wine element and they apparently are succeeding

1315
01:45:53.18 --> 01:45:59.42
We still have two more buildings to clear the first one is empty the second one has a few North Vietnamese army soldiers

1316
01:45:59.42 --> 01:46:02.78
I toss a concussion grenade into the room and as soon as it explodes

1317
01:46:03.02 --> 01:46:09.42
Captain Dan drops the floor and I stand in the door straddling him we create a crossfire with me firing fully

1318
01:46:09.66 --> 01:46:12.06
Automatic from right to left and he from left to right

1319
01:46:12.06 --> 01:46:17.02
He yells clear and I back out and shine my flashlight so he can confirm we've neutralized everyone

1320
01:46:17.58 --> 01:46:22.22
Because there are a number of them we do a closer check that they are all neutralized

1321
01:46:23.34 --> 01:46:29.74
In the clearing of the buildings at Sante, Captain Dan and I are the only two man team depending on how close you are to the grenade when it explodes

1322
01:46:30.06 --> 01:46:35.34
It can bust your ear drums and pretty well mess you up and building 12 as I'm confirming everyone is dead

1323
01:46:35.34 --> 01:46:38.06
It's a grim task whatever you're thinking right now

1324
01:46:38.06 --> 01:46:41.90
It is far more grim than that a guard raises his weapon behind me

1325
01:46:42.46 --> 01:46:47.02
Captain Dan neutralizes him. There is no doubt with that decisive action

1326
01:46:47.26 --> 01:46:49.26
Captain Dan saved my life

1327
01:46:53.34 --> 01:46:57.90
So you're sitting you're going through the buildings are you just doing security rounds in these guys

1328
01:46:58.62 --> 01:47:01.02
And then one of them that you haven't gotten to yet

1329
01:47:02.06 --> 01:47:05.42
We just you know we just put a bullet nearby said

1330
01:47:05.42 --> 01:47:11.42
Mm-hmm, I'm making sure and while you're doing that one of those guys that you hadn't gotten to yet

1331
01:47:12.54 --> 01:47:18.06
Decides he's gonna take a shot at you and Captain Dan sees him and kills him. Yeah, I had my back toy

1332
01:47:18.54 --> 01:47:20.54
What he did

1333
01:47:20.54 --> 01:47:22.54
Dan fire scare me

1334
01:47:23.58 --> 01:47:28.30
I thought somebody was shooting you know, but it was it was Dan shooting all right, but

1335
01:47:28.30 --> 01:47:33.58
I'm shooting the guy that that was gonna take me out so I

1336
01:47:35.42 --> 01:47:41.42
Approaching 0228 lieutenant Colonel Sidner received notification that green leaf group is not out a commission

1337
01:47:41.98 --> 01:47:47.66
We can hear apple one landing and are told the hold fast until green leaf elements get to their original plan positions

1338
01:47:47.90 --> 01:47:50.86
With 22 men of green leaf team including bullseimants

1339
01:47:50.86 --> 01:47:59.02
We are back on track within one minute green leaf has secured the guard quarters per the plan and takes over their rules that the red wine team members

1340
01:47:59.02 --> 01:48:01.02
Have been handling for them

1341
01:48:01.42 --> 01:48:03.42
Again, that's a comp that seems real easy

1342
01:48:04.38 --> 01:48:09.82
But when you got all the shooting going on and now you got friendly's moving into positions where there's other friendlies and you got

1343
01:48:10.30 --> 01:48:15.02
Enemy shooting at you that this is a sketchy thing it was very intense

1344
01:48:15.02 --> 01:48:22.54
Right there and we were kind of away from it because we were we were going to the communication building and over here was

1345
01:48:22.62 --> 01:48:25.82
Where they were coming from of course, you know

1346
01:48:27.42 --> 01:48:33.10
Adon they was he had I am 79 grade launcher, so he was booping them right in the windows and

1347
01:48:34.62 --> 01:48:37.74
You know, oh Kentucky Wendy's work real well

1348
01:48:37.74 --> 01:48:49.50
In fact Tyrone is getting the bullseimants award for socom. Oh, I'll stay in the outstand now. So well deserved. Yeah, that's outstanding

1349
01:48:52.62 --> 01:48:58.54
You go on here at 0229 we had just reached the communication buildings when I heard on my head set

1350
01:48:59.18 --> 01:49:01.18
Negative items

1351
01:49:01.18 --> 01:49:04.22
I told Captain Dan he asked me are you sure?

1352
01:49:04.22 --> 01:49:08.38
I dooms was the code word for POWs

1353
01:49:09.42 --> 01:49:15.74
It didn't make any sense the next radio call I heard was at 0 230 begin extraction to choppers

1354
01:49:16.30 --> 01:49:19.50
We entered the communication buildings without tossing a grenade. It was empty

1355
01:49:20.38 --> 01:49:23.74
At this time we started to move back to the LZ for extraction

1356
01:49:23.74 --> 01:49:27.90
We still moved with these assumption that there could be more enemy soldiers lying in the bushes

1357
01:49:28.46 --> 01:49:32.14
While the helicopters were and route were returning to extract us

1358
01:49:32.14 --> 01:49:40.30
One of red wines rolls was to clear the planned LZ by cutting down certain light poles that task revealed one frustrating

1359
01:49:40.70 --> 01:49:45.26
Surprise we had brought a chainsaw to cut down certain wooden telephone poles

1360
01:49:45.58 --> 01:49:53.50
But sergeant first class Charles, Maston and sergeant first class Ronnie straight hand were to blow up a tall concrete light pole

1361
01:49:54.22 --> 01:49:59.50
The moment that Maston and Strahan finished placing the four one pound packets of c4 explosive

1362
01:49:59.50 --> 01:50:05.34
We're ready to blow and we're conforming confirming that they should activate the fuse apple one was arriving

1363
01:50:06.70 --> 01:50:10.86
They waited until apple one had landed offloaded green leaf and departed

1364
01:50:11.10 --> 01:50:16.78
Ensured of safety they detonated the c4 as the pole rose into the air a huge flash of light

1365
01:50:16.78 --> 01:50:18.78
Maston and Strahan could

1366
01:50:18.78 --> 01:50:23.58
See that this was not a light pole it had four large high tension power lines

1367
01:50:23.58 --> 01:50:30.86
Dancing sparks were everywhere as the four huge power lines hit the rice patties the very rice patties

1368
01:50:30.86 --> 01:50:35.02
And which our soldiers and POWs would be marching to load the returning chalpers

1369
01:50:35.50 --> 01:50:40.22
We were going to have to find a new location where are we going to have to find a new location for the LZ

1370
01:50:40.70 --> 01:50:47.50
Maston, Strahan and Captain Jim McClam as the marshalling area control officer immediately set about ensuring

1371
01:50:47.66 --> 01:50:50.94
They understood the location of all the wines and whether they were hot

1372
01:50:50.94 --> 01:50:59.98
After assessing the situation and ensuring there were no other potential hazards they began placing the bean bag lights in an area

1373
01:51:00.30 --> 01:51:02.30
suitably distant from the power lines

1374
01:51:05.74 --> 01:51:14.30
As everyone returned to the LZ waiting for the helicopters we had a few minutes to gather people and equipment to load on apple one and apple two

1375
01:51:14.30 --> 01:51:20.46
You just not go into your life lessons in here

1376
01:51:21.18 --> 01:51:26.14
Don't be a complainer the world is moving on and needs people to solve problems

1377
01:51:26.54 --> 01:51:32.06
A value at your situation make a decision and execute any new plan without complaining and feels or for yourself

1378
01:51:34.54 --> 01:51:36.54
Not gonna help

1379
01:51:36.54 --> 01:51:39.58
Not gonna help the situation. You gotta make things happen. Exactly

1380
01:51:39.58 --> 01:51:47.42
No POWs was not something we had spent time thinking about

1381
01:51:48.14 --> 01:51:54.62
I could hear chatter on my headset. I heard the RTO for bull say that bull was coming into the compound

1382
01:51:54.62 --> 01:51:58.22
Bull had to verify with his own eyes that there were no POWs

1383
01:51:59.34 --> 01:52:05.90
A 0 237 apple one landed facing east toward Hanoi and loaded red wine group in blue boy group

1384
01:52:05.90 --> 01:52:11.98
Captain band and I were the last ones to board the two of us sat in the tail of the chopper loading the door fully

1385
01:52:12.38 --> 01:52:16.86
Down and open with a mini gun mounted right between us manned by an air force PJ

1386
01:52:17.90 --> 01:52:21.90
as 0 240 we lifted off and turned west looking out of the tail

1387
01:52:22.78 --> 01:52:27.58
We had a front row seat with a bird's eye view of Hanoi. I will never forget that view

1388
01:52:28.22 --> 01:52:31.50
I couldn't believe how big Hanoi was and how close we were to it

1389
01:52:31.50 --> 01:52:34.22
It looked like any major city in America

1390
01:52:34.22 --> 01:52:37.58
We were only about 20 miles from the capital of North Vietnam

1391
01:52:39.42 --> 01:52:43.18
Never before had the Vietnam War Vietnamese army been violated like this

1392
01:52:43.66 --> 01:52:46.38
That's when it really hit me what we had just done

1393
01:52:48.54 --> 01:52:54.62
We were rising only a minute or two after lift off suddenly our chopper took a hard dive to the left

1394
01:52:55.10 --> 01:53:02.22
What looked like a telephone pole with a bright red fireball shot bias? I yelled over the captain Dan what the hell is that?

1395
01:53:02.22 --> 01:53:08.06
Before he could answer the gun or standing between us yelled that it was a surface to air missile a Sam

1396
01:53:09.74 --> 01:53:12.94
Now I was scared while it was on the ground, but now it was really scared

1397
01:53:13.82 --> 01:53:17.42
And this is what you were talking about before on the ground. I have a fighting chance

1398
01:53:17.42 --> 01:53:20.62
But being in a chopper at 600 feet you feel like a sitting duck

1399
01:53:20.78 --> 01:53:24.70
Thank God for some of the best pilots we could have these guys knew how to handle it

1400
01:53:24.70 --> 01:53:33.42
We were soon out from the threat into the dark jungle mountains and headed for you, Dorn

1401
01:53:33.42 --> 01:53:36.78
During the next three hours on the flight back to base I had plenty of time to replay what we had done that night

1402
01:53:36.78 --> 01:53:41.26
Like the rest of the raiders I was very disappointed that we came home with no POWs

1403
01:53:41.50 --> 01:53:46.78
I kept thinking what went wrong why when when had the POWs been moved

1404
01:53:47.66 --> 01:53:51.42
That flight returning to you doing seemed a lot longer than the flight to Sante

1405
01:53:51.42 --> 01:54:00.46
We've been so pumped up about our mission to find no POWs was the last thing that would have ever crossed our mind beyond the two wounds received

1406
01:54:01.50 --> 01:54:06.78
US Air Force tech sergeant Lee were right ankle was broken during one of the crash landings and

1407
01:54:07.58 --> 01:54:10.54
Surgeon first class Joe Maria America's only casualty

1408
01:54:11.74 --> 01:54:14.38
Our night that night was our morale

1409
01:54:14.38 --> 01:54:20.78
And that's something again you covered these details in the book, but one of the one of the

1410
01:54:21.34 --> 01:54:25.90
aircraft actually crash landed on purpose into the combat right

1411
01:54:27.18 --> 01:54:34.14
Blueway yeah, and the reason for that was the people making the planning

1412
01:54:35.66 --> 01:54:40.14
Initially they thought we'd drop in a C 130

1413
01:54:40.14 --> 01:54:49.42
But they didn't know if the guards had orders to shoot the field devias if there was an rescue attempt or

1414
01:54:50.86 --> 01:54:55.26
Exactly what so they they planned on having control of the guards

1415
01:54:56.62 --> 01:55:00.70
Within 60 seconds a minute. I gave us a minute to have

1416
01:55:00.70 --> 01:55:13.02
Complete control of the guards inside the compound and I'm taking out to two guard towers and the third one up by blueway and then control into guards and being in there

1417
01:55:13.74 --> 01:55:15.74
And that's what we did

1418
01:55:16.06 --> 01:55:23.66
I mean they did a they did a great job on there and it's just that there was no POWs in there and then

1419
01:55:24.22 --> 01:55:26.86
You know people say well, while were their guards and

1420
01:55:26.86 --> 01:55:32.38
You know we don't know if they were why they're regards, but they were still in the

1421
01:55:33.34 --> 01:55:35.82
towers when we

1422
01:55:36.78 --> 01:55:38.78
We I say we they red

1423
01:55:39.58 --> 01:55:42.14
Green our blue boy took care of them

1424
01:55:42.94 --> 01:55:45.18
So our job was outside

1425
01:55:46.38 --> 01:55:48.38
We were really

1426
01:55:48.78 --> 01:55:52.54
Teams red wine green leaf and blue boy all had specific

1427
01:55:52.54 --> 01:56:00.46
Task to accomplish and that's what we did we worked on our task to get that done and if everybody did their task

1428
01:56:00.46 --> 01:56:07.90
Like we had practiced and rehearsed so many times it would be a great success and it was the success from the standpoint

1429
01:56:09.98 --> 01:56:12.54
Doing the job of eliminating the threat and

1430
01:56:13.90 --> 01:56:17.18
Controlling the POW camp and the guards

1431
01:56:18.14 --> 01:56:21.10
We just didn't anticipate the POWs not being there

1432
01:56:21.10 --> 01:56:25.10
And that was the the heartbreaking part of it

1433
01:56:28.38 --> 01:56:33.90
You say this to say we were disappointed would be an understate understatement some of us talked about it

1434
01:56:34.14 --> 01:56:42.46
How maybe we should have gone into Hanoi we were thinking crazy thoughts like that that's how confident we were when we got some rest at you doing for a couple hours

1435
01:56:42.62 --> 01:56:44.62
We flew a C130

1436
01:56:45.02 --> 01:56:50.62
And we were briefed again in the auditorium what to say and more importantly what not to talk about we packed our

1437
01:56:50.62 --> 01:56:55.98
Duffel bag secured our equipment and had a few hours to relax the C141 that we boarded it was

1438
01:56:56.54 --> 01:57:00.14
One that had been prep for MetaVac ready to bring POWs home

1439
01:57:01.10 --> 01:57:03.98
Now its mission was just to bring us to Elgit at Eglon

1440
01:57:06.14 --> 01:57:15.82
All the after action reports were finalized to exal exal auxiliary field number three and we spent two days before heading home to North Carolina on C123

1441
01:57:15.82 --> 01:57:24.70
So that's it you do like a debrief you fill out your paperwork explaining what exactly you did

1442
01:57:25.98 --> 01:57:30.78
And then you wrap up you're you know at the training site we had spent all this time preparing for the mission

1443
01:57:31.98 --> 01:57:37.18
And then you say this landing at Pope Air Force Base North Carolina a couple days later was a very happy time

1444
01:57:38.14 --> 01:57:43.34
It is happy for the Raiders and for all the people awaiting us families friends and the army support personnel

1445
01:57:43.34 --> 01:57:48.14
There to process us back to our normal world at Fort Bragg in fact for me personally

1446
01:57:48.78 --> 01:57:50.78
That is the most memorable moment

1447
01:57:50.78 --> 01:57:56.14
It was not the training or the day or of the launch or the landing at Sonte for me

1448
01:57:56.14 --> 01:58:00.62
It was the landing at Pope Air Force Base. I will never forget what I witnessed that day

1449
01:58:01.74 --> 01:58:04.62
I was a single guy so a couple of my buddies came to pick me up

1450
01:58:04.78 --> 01:58:09.90
But standing there on the flight line when I looked around and at the men unloading from the airplane

1451
01:58:09.90 --> 01:58:13.82
I saw their wives and children's running out to meet them. It really hit me

1452
01:58:14.54 --> 01:58:22.54
The bull had warned us that we had a 50 50 chance of not coming home a 50 50 chance of this moment never happening

1453
01:58:23.50 --> 01:58:27.82
If there had been a security breach it was unlikely that we could have been rescued

1454
01:58:27.82 --> 01:58:39.02
These warriors had laid their lives on the line to rescue fellow warriors

1455
01:58:42.54 --> 01:58:49.74
Four days after the raid on Wednesday November 25th, 1970 President Nixon honored the Sonte Raiders by having

1456
01:58:49.74 --> 01:58:54.46
Raider representatives in a televised ceremony in the White House's east room

1457
01:58:54.46 --> 01:58:56.46
That had to be pretty

1458
01:58:57.66 --> 01:59:02.46
It's pretty cool pretty crazy. It's so is on the news and everyone now

1459
01:59:02.46 --> 01:59:11.90
He almost immediately knew what it happened right and the only reason for that was the fact that hand-o-ai had come on and said they had been bombed

1460
01:59:13.26 --> 01:59:14.46
And

1461
01:59:14.46 --> 01:59:16.46
What they had been

1462
01:59:16.46 --> 01:59:18.46
Not bombed but they had

1463
01:59:18.46 --> 01:59:21.18
Fliers dropped out over the city and

1464
01:59:21.18 --> 01:59:29.82
And that was the diversion process and so the United States had to come on and say no we didn't bomb them

1465
01:59:30.22 --> 01:59:37.10
We did a POW raid and these were aircraft that were dropping flares to

1466
01:59:38.06 --> 01:59:41.90
Offset the Sonte Raiders coming in on the backside

1467
01:59:42.62 --> 01:59:45.34
So it was kind of a political but you know

1468
01:59:45.34 --> 01:59:53.74
The justify what we had done and the fact that the attempt was made to free POWs

1469
01:59:54.62 --> 01:59:58.38
Which was went a long way and that arena back then

1470
01:59:59.98 --> 02:00:02.94
This is how how would you say this level of

1471
02:00:04.14 --> 02:00:07.02
Media attention compared to the bin Laden raid?

1472
02:00:07.02 --> 02:00:14.06
Hmm, I mean the thing about the bin Laden raid was we were the

1473
02:00:15.42 --> 02:00:21.02
The war wasn't intense as intense at that point as Vietnam was I mean Vietnam was right full-on

1474
02:00:21.66 --> 02:00:23.66
So it would have gotten a little bit

1475
02:00:24.14 --> 02:00:26.46
Less attention. I mean the bin Laden raid was

1476
02:00:27.58 --> 02:00:33.66
Compared about his about his big of a new story as there's ever been I think yeah, yeah, that's true and

1477
02:00:33.66 --> 02:00:41.34
You know the good thing if you look at the bin Laden raid compared to the Sonte Raid

1478
02:00:42.62 --> 02:00:49.02
They were they copied what the Sonte Raiders about and that's the

1479
02:00:49.66 --> 02:00:55.34
Good part about the Sonte Raiders the impact it's had over the years

1480
02:00:56.22 --> 02:01:02.06
On all the raids that have been done since then have been modeled after the Sonte Raid because

1481
02:01:02.06 --> 02:01:04.06
Not because the

1482
02:01:04.06 --> 02:01:07.74
Success it had I've getting in and getting out

1483
02:01:07.90 --> 02:01:15.58
But the way the the way they planned it and all the information that went into that and how they

1484
02:01:16.38 --> 02:01:21.18
How they planned it made an impact on the success of it. Yeah, I mean

1485
02:01:21.18 --> 02:01:25.10
I know I know you know Adam when we're graven he wrote

1486
02:01:25.66 --> 02:01:31.02
It was sort of like his feces when he was at the post graduate school about all the

1487
02:01:31.02 --> 02:01:37.98
Most important special operations missions in history right and he wrote about the Sonte Raid

1488
02:01:38.62 --> 02:01:41.02
And then he was also like one of the guys is he one of the

1489
02:01:41.66 --> 02:01:46.06
Senior guys conducting the planning for the bin Laden raid so yeah, there's a direct

1490
02:01:46.94 --> 02:01:55.66
Connection between the lessons learned and the and the protocol that you use to to get this done and yeah, no doubt about that. It's a

1491
02:01:55.66 --> 02:02:06.86
Pretty interesting to see the truth to see this thread in history and yeah, it is I mean and today the Sonte Raid is taught at all the military schools and

1492
02:02:07.58 --> 02:02:09.58
You know so come in fact

1493
02:02:10.30 --> 02:02:13.58
They're making a movie on this and

1494
02:02:13.90 --> 02:02:22.58
Is so come making the movie or is like Hollywood making the movie? It's a a group of people that are doing a doctor or men

1495
02:02:22.58 --> 02:02:26.82
Right, okay, but the seventh special forces is going to

1496
02:02:28.10 --> 02:02:34.18
My understanding is they're gonna participate in having the Sonte Raid as a training film for

1497
02:02:34.98 --> 02:02:40.82
Future because what they've done they've interviewed a lot of the people on the raid and they've interviewed

1498
02:02:41.14 --> 02:02:45.38
The Peel dubias and they've kind of combined it all together in fact

1499
02:02:45.38 --> 02:02:54.90
Next in May I'm going down to do the screening on it at socom and I'm going down to see the screening and make sure

1500
02:02:56.02 --> 02:03:02.50
We always told anybody that's gonna do this we want we want it to be authentic we don't want Hollywood

1501
02:03:03.22 --> 02:03:04.82
so

1502
02:03:04.82 --> 02:03:07.86
last year I went out to Phoenix and did a

1503
02:03:08.90 --> 02:03:10.90
Group the group is building this

1504
02:03:10.90 --> 02:03:18.26
Movie on it and they actually built the compound and they used they had one of us from each group

1505
02:03:19.06 --> 02:03:22.10
Redmigree and they from blue boy and then an navigation

1506
02:03:22.82 --> 02:03:28.42
John Gargas Colonel Gargas who was Air Force the navigator that took us in and

1507
02:03:29.62 --> 02:03:31.62
They made all of the

1508
02:03:32.74 --> 02:03:34.90
They wanted to know how we cleared a building

1509
02:03:34.90 --> 02:03:41.22
They wanted to know all that stuff and it's home the ball you know it's home the hand grenades

1510
02:03:41.22 --> 02:03:44.02
And all that stuff and they did a really good

1511
02:03:44.42 --> 02:03:51.46
You have done a really good job on it and they're they're shopping and I think to Netflix and everything right now

1512
02:03:51.46 --> 02:03:56.90
But they're very close to having it completed but they've really done a nice job of making it

1513
02:03:58.18 --> 02:04:01.54
Authentic as to what actually took place and how it happened

1514
02:04:01.54 --> 02:04:06.18
So they're a good training film definitely yeah, that'll be awesome to see

1515
02:04:09.38 --> 02:04:11.38
You see here

1516
02:04:11.38 --> 02:04:14.66
I remember being told to report to the repeat parade field in my dress greens

1517
02:04:15.38 --> 02:04:16.82
This is December 9th

1518
02:04:16.82 --> 02:04:25.22
1970 for an award ceremony. It was a nice sunny cool day when secretary defense Melvin layered personally presented the medals to the members of the sauntay raid

1519
02:04:25.22 --> 02:04:32.98
There I stood spit shine jump boots jump wings expert rifle badge and the seventh special forces group risen ribbon

1520
02:04:33.70 --> 02:04:40.74
Brigadier general Henry Emerson the commander of special forces at for brag thank the raiders for their courage and dedication

1521
02:04:41.06 --> 02:04:44.02
We had reflected well on the green berets

1522
02:04:46.66 --> 02:04:51.14
And then you all were awarded it was I think six distinguished service crosses

1523
02:04:51.14 --> 02:05:00.66
Five air force crosses were awarded there was a total of 85 silver stars which included all of the raiders right

1524
02:05:03.86 --> 02:05:08.58
And the following comments were made by secretary defense

1525
02:05:10.66 --> 02:05:12.90
Melvin layered he said this

1526
02:05:14.18 --> 02:05:20.66
We are here to honor the brave the brave and dedicated men we confer on them today awards that

1527
02:05:20.66 --> 02:05:28.02
Express their gratitude their countries gratitude and admiration the mission for which these men volunteered called for

1528
02:05:28.02 --> 02:05:30.50
Undaunted courage and deep compassion

1529
02:05:31.54 --> 02:05:38.66
They were asked to go deep into enemy territory to search for and if possible to rescue their comrades and arms

1530
02:05:38.82 --> 02:05:40.82
Who are prisoners of war

1531
02:05:41.22 --> 02:05:47.78
They performed their mission flawlessly from the outset the president the nation's top military leadership and I

1532
02:05:47.78 --> 02:05:51.30
gave total and unqualified support to this mission

1533
02:05:51.54 --> 02:05:58.02
I knew as these men did how grave were the risks they willingly undertook

1534
02:05:59.06 --> 02:06:05.54
I knew as these men did that there was a chance of disappointment and even of failure

1535
02:06:06.66 --> 02:06:12.98
But the reasonable chance to return to freedom Americans held captive made this mission well worth the risk

1536
02:06:12.98 --> 02:06:19.06
If a similar chance to save Americans were to arise tomorrow I would act

1537
02:06:19.70 --> 02:06:24.34
Just as I did in approving and supporting the effort at song day

1538
02:06:34.18 --> 02:06:40.26
Man that's not too often the secretary that shows up at your command to start handed out 85 silver stars

1539
02:06:40.26 --> 02:06:42.26
Yeah, you do

1540
02:06:43.94 --> 02:06:49.22
After that I'm going to the book you say they gave each of us 30 days of leave untarged against our balance

1541
02:06:49.22 --> 02:06:53.38
We got 30 days of free leave. That's nice. So I went home for a whole month of December

1542
02:06:53.94 --> 02:06:56.98
Back home in Missouri we talked about a little about the mission

1543
02:06:56.98 --> 02:07:01.94
But not too much. It's funny how some people don't understand the significance of a combat raid

1544
02:07:01.94 --> 02:07:06.26
I wasn't going to try and impress upon them most of my friends had not gone into the military

1545
02:07:06.26 --> 02:07:11.94
So I didn't have any significant conversations with them about the raid someone got married and we're busy with their own lives

1546
02:07:12.02 --> 02:07:17.54
My dad was a good listener for me. He expressed his pride and after a few beers at the east sign

1547
02:07:17.94 --> 02:07:21.38
Tavern on in moberly he even told me some of his friends

1548
02:07:22.02 --> 02:07:24.02
Even told some of his friends what I had done

1549
02:07:24.10 --> 02:07:26.58
But to tell you the truth after about four or five days

1550
02:07:27.14 --> 02:07:30.26
I was ready to head back to brag and my army buddies

1551
02:07:30.26 --> 02:07:34.74
And you got life less than eight here

1552
02:07:36.10 --> 02:07:41.46
It says veterans we all have a mission listen to your fellow veterans it is important for the veteran

1553
02:07:41.46 --> 02:07:46.18
But it's also important for the listener it is important for America good stories and bad

1554
02:07:46.42 --> 02:07:51.62
They need to be told please take my request to heart and talk with a veteran and

1555
02:07:52.82 --> 02:07:54.82
That's one thing that you have in this book

1556
02:07:54.82 --> 02:08:01.14
You've got a whole it's over 140 pages of this book is all the different perspective

1557
02:08:01.14 --> 02:08:06.26
We've just told you're perspective and it's very interesting to hear your perspective as the youngest guy on the raid

1558
02:08:06.90 --> 02:08:08.90
Somebody with no combat experience

1559
02:08:09.78 --> 02:08:15.94
But you have the perspective of a bunch of different people not just the raiders but the support people

1560
02:08:16.50 --> 02:08:23.70
The aircraft the pilots the crew you've got incredible amount of stories to be told that are told in this book

1561
02:08:23.70 --> 02:08:32.34
That every one of them gives a different angle of the story. It's and now that came about when I started writing my I started writing the book in 2012

1562
02:08:32.34 --> 02:08:38.42
My daughter went to Afghanistan at time and she was asking you know what all do you do and I thought

1563
02:08:39.14 --> 02:08:42.34
I'm an ent talking man. There's been several books on the raid

1564
02:08:43.06 --> 02:08:46.82
But none by anybody that was on the ground so

1565
02:08:47.86 --> 02:08:51.54
That's guy. What prompted me to do it so

1566
02:08:51.54 --> 02:08:53.54
But the

1567
02:08:53.94 --> 02:09:02.98
The thing that I got out of that was in the process. I realized that I wanted more than my opinion

1568
02:09:02.98 --> 02:09:11.86
So I we have an email chain that we go out on so I send an email out to all the P.O. Davies and the Raiders and the support guys

1569
02:09:12.42 --> 02:09:14.42
If you have

1570
02:09:14.98 --> 02:09:17.46
Something that you would like to put in the book, you know

1571
02:09:17.46 --> 02:09:24.98
Send it to me. I'll put it in unedited into the book and I got about 40 of them and

1572
02:09:25.78 --> 02:09:33.38
Some are one paragraph summer three or four five pages, you know, but it's their memorable moment on the raid

1573
02:09:33.78 --> 02:09:41.22
Or about the rate or whatever might be and you know, it just gives a whole different perspective, you know from a P.O. W. standpoint

1574
02:09:41.70 --> 02:09:43.38
to a guy flying at you know

1575
02:09:43.38 --> 02:09:52.02
Mid midcap overs and it really I think rounded out the book. Yeah, it's not gonna read it today

1576
02:09:52.02 --> 02:09:56.34
Get the book but the story about the guys the got hit with a

1577
02:09:56.66 --> 02:10:02.58
Frag from the surface to air missile and ended up punching out just here in that story with him talking about you know

1578
02:10:02.58 --> 02:10:08.90
They're just having a conversation like what about to what about to eject from an aircraft which by the way is

1579
02:10:08.90 --> 02:10:15.62
A life and death thing this yeah when you when you eject from an aircraft there's I don't know what the chances that you're gonna die

1580
02:10:15.86 --> 02:10:18.82
But there's definitely a strong chance that you're

1581
02:10:19.62 --> 02:10:23.94
You know ejecting through the canopy going 400 miles an hour or whatever it is

1582
02:10:24.18 --> 02:10:30.26
I was dead. Lowery. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a decent chance you're gonna die just from that and then you're gonna land in wherever

1583
02:10:30.58 --> 02:10:33.78
Vietnom louse the ocean you don't know what the hell's gonna happen

1584
02:10:33.78 --> 02:10:36.10
And these guys are talking about it like they think you up there

1585
02:10:36.10 --> 02:10:38.90
We're gonna have to punch out. Yeah, okay. Well, let let me know when you're ready

1586
02:10:38.90 --> 02:10:43.06
They're doing it like this yeah, I'm freaking calm cool and collected

1587
02:10:44.74 --> 02:10:46.74
Really a great guy to

1588
02:10:47.38 --> 02:10:51.78
Get the meeting man and then and then of course they end up having to get picked up

1589
02:10:52.90 --> 02:10:56.58
Yeah, the next day they spend the night it's like a little after father the book

1590
02:10:56.58 --> 02:11:03.46
But it's it's its own story in itself so you're taking your own advice on life less late and getting these other stories out there

1591
02:11:03.46 --> 02:11:05.46
Um

1592
02:11:05.46 --> 02:11:08.90
So check that check to get the book for that stuff as well

1593
02:11:09.22 --> 02:11:15.46
You say your life goes on the next week. I was back at D company 7 special forces group at Fort Bragg

1594
02:11:15.46 --> 02:11:18.66
That's it back to back to normal life

1595
02:11:19.14 --> 02:11:21.14
you end up

1596
02:11:21.14 --> 02:11:22.18
You end up

1597
02:11:22.18 --> 02:11:26.98
Getting involved in the sport of orientering which is like math and compass while you're running

1598
02:11:26.98 --> 02:11:36.66
Yeah, basically the next year you spend time doing this orientering so like as the as part of the team of 7 special forces group

1599
02:11:37.86 --> 02:11:39.14
Um

1600
02:11:39.14 --> 02:11:44.02
You say by December of 1971 our team had represented special forces in several orientering meats

1601
02:11:44.02 --> 02:11:50.50
I finished 15th in the US military championship 7th in the US championship 45th in the Canadian championship

1602
02:11:51.70 --> 02:11:53.70
So you go through that and then

1603
02:11:53.70 --> 02:12:00.42
You say when I heard in December 1971 that the army was offering early outs that really appealed to me

1604
02:12:00.42 --> 02:12:04.58
I felt ready to do my own thing and not to be told what to do all the time

1605
02:12:04.58 --> 02:12:07.38
I took advantage of the opportunity separating January 5th

1606
02:12:07.62 --> 02:12:08.82
1972

1607
02:12:08.82 --> 02:12:11.54
Start it back at junior college January 7th back home

1608
02:12:13.22 --> 02:12:17.78
So how long was your total service? Well, I was active three years

1609
02:12:17.78 --> 02:12:26.82
And I was in reserve for four I stayed in okay so we you are we you are actually doing reserve duty on the weekends and whatnot

1610
02:12:27.70 --> 02:12:30.26
I was making money to go to college

1611
02:12:32.98 --> 02:12:36.98
So you go to school what's your studying school? Business

1612
02:12:38.82 --> 02:12:45.14
Aged their Martin independent study of business and then you graduate and you're not you know it's 1974

1613
02:12:45.14 --> 02:12:48.98
You're having a little trouble finding a job, but oh yeah

1614
02:12:50.34 --> 02:12:53.30
But uh, at one of the sauntay raiders

1615
02:12:53.94 --> 02:12:55.94
reunions you you

1616
02:12:56.82 --> 02:13:01.30
Get connected with Ross Peroff. Yes, he he he had the reunion

1617
02:13:02.26 --> 02:13:08.02
1974 I guess well all the POW debbies and the raiders at San Francisco and

1618
02:13:08.02 --> 02:13:16.26
And we had an afternoon he brought all the raiders in the POWs together and he said you know if there's any

1619
02:13:16.26 --> 02:13:18.66
thing I've never knew for any of you let me know

1620
02:13:19.70 --> 02:13:22.90
And as a result of that I thought you know

1621
02:13:24.10 --> 02:13:29.70
A medical and I don't have a job, but I need help, you know, so I wrote a letter to Ross Peroff and

1622
02:13:30.90 --> 02:13:34.66
I got a response back that they flew me down for a new interview and

1623
02:13:34.66 --> 02:13:37.94
I was hired work read yes

1624
02:13:38.66 --> 02:13:40.02
And

1625
02:13:40.02 --> 02:13:42.02
He kept his word

1626
02:13:42.02 --> 02:13:49.30
That's pretty amazing and then how long did you do how long to work for a EDS? I work for EDS for about three years and then you end up with another job

1627
02:13:49.86 --> 02:13:55.86
And what was the next job you got? I went the from there to selling computer furniture and

1628
02:13:55.86 --> 02:14:04.42
We're for a company called right line. I work for them for about five years and then I was hired away from that company by

1629
02:14:05.06 --> 02:14:08.82
Greg Kales who was my old boss at that time there and

1630
02:14:10.18 --> 02:14:12.90
selling you'd add a micro graphics and

1631
02:14:13.78 --> 02:14:18.18
He sold the business and I decided to start my own so

1632
02:14:18.90 --> 02:14:20.90
I went into my own business of

1633
02:14:21.22 --> 02:14:23.94
Document imaging and document imaging

1634
02:14:23.94 --> 02:14:26.50
Where we scan documents and store

1635
02:14:26.98 --> 02:14:33.30
Digitism and is that still running today? Yes, what's it called Delta systems Delta systems?

1636
02:14:34.18 --> 02:14:37.62
That's a new Delta for just happens to mean

1637
02:14:38.18 --> 02:14:41.38
name in the company or in Kansas City and

1638
02:14:42.26 --> 02:14:46.34
Wait and you're doing that in the late 80s you were doing that

1639
02:14:46.34 --> 02:14:54.58
Hmm, I jumped started because that's everything is digital now. Yeah, and amazing how much is still being printed out today?

1640
02:14:55.14 --> 02:14:56.42
Crazy

1641
02:14:56.42 --> 02:15:01.06
And that's still running right now Delta systems. How big is the company?

1642
02:15:02.34 --> 02:15:07.94
Well, there's only about five of us so we're small company, but we we do a lot of work

1643
02:15:07.94 --> 02:15:13.06
We're in probably now maybe 1520 30 states and

1644
02:15:13.06 --> 02:15:21.06
And we have resellers this other product and then we do a lot in the healthcare

1645
02:15:21.86 --> 02:15:26.82
Medical but you name an end-ass ringer probably have a system installed in it so

1646
02:15:29.94 --> 02:15:31.94
What is government or

1647
02:15:33.86 --> 02:15:38.18
We just you're out there anybody's got favorite money get rid of it we can help

1648
02:15:38.18 --> 02:15:44.82
And you you know you mentioned earlier your wife Marsha

1649
02:15:47.94 --> 02:15:53.14
When did you meet her I'm in and what was that what was the arc the story arc there?

1650
02:15:54.02 --> 02:16:00.82
We were at the time I was a member of the beta processing management association in Kansas City

1651
02:16:01.46 --> 02:16:06.02
and we I was on the border directors for that and we were

1652
02:16:06.02 --> 02:16:10.58
Down at a bar after a board meeting one night and

1653
02:16:11.54 --> 02:16:14.58
Marsha and her girlfriend walked in the place was packed and

1654
02:16:15.06 --> 02:16:20.42
Couple of the guys that were on the board happened to get up and leave just as they walked in so we had to open seats

1655
02:16:20.98 --> 02:16:24.34
And we said come sit down here with us and they did and

1656
02:16:25.62 --> 02:16:28.42
So I met Marsha that was in September

1657
02:16:29.46 --> 02:16:31.46
Let's see that would have been

1658
02:16:31.46 --> 02:16:35.46
84

1659
02:16:37.46 --> 02:16:41.06
And so we end up getting married and

1660
02:16:42.58 --> 02:16:50.66
She had a little boy Aaron who is down in Texas and my daughter which you met here and honey and

1661
02:16:52.02 --> 02:16:55.54
So we we got married in

1662
02:16:56.34 --> 02:16:57.34
October

1663
02:16:57.34 --> 02:16:58.34
20th of

1664
02:16:58.34 --> 02:17:00.34
1984 and

1665
02:17:00.34 --> 02:17:03.70
I started the business 1989

1666
02:17:05.54 --> 02:17:07.54
There was a

1667
02:17:07.54 --> 02:17:13.54
What was there some story about scuba diving in here? Do you guys get married under water or something or engaged under water?

1668
02:17:13.54 --> 02:17:15.70
What was the story? We were in Kansas

1669
02:17:15.70 --> 02:17:21.14
I had a we were in Hawaii and place called witches brew which is in front of Namabay

1670
02:17:21.70 --> 02:17:24.66
on the island of Oahu and

1671
02:17:24.66 --> 02:17:31.46
I have a friend over there that was a dental hygienic and she had some that red dental floss

1672
02:17:32.02 --> 02:17:34.02
So I wrapped the ring and that

1673
02:17:34.34 --> 02:17:37.78
I did it on it put it in a little murmur and had a 35 millimeter

1674
02:17:38.18 --> 02:17:40.74
Tarratases put that down on my web suit

1675
02:17:41.38 --> 02:17:48.66
We don't swim out the the place called witches brewed and we went down about 30 feet under and I stopped her and I said

1676
02:17:48.66 --> 02:17:50.66
I pulled out on a dangled it

1677
02:17:50.66 --> 02:17:53.86
Of course everything three times bigger one

1678
02:17:54.58 --> 02:17:56.58
She thought she was in a little rarer

1679
02:17:58.42 --> 02:18:00.42
Or said

1680
02:18:00.42 --> 02:18:02.42
Melty when we got on the surface

1681
02:18:03.70 --> 02:18:07.22
She went from 1.5 kms to 0.5

1682
02:18:08.26 --> 02:18:10.26
Exactly

1683
02:18:10.26 --> 02:18:12.82
But then you had a so you had a son

1684
02:18:13.54 --> 02:18:15.54
Aaron and then your daughter

1685
02:18:15.54 --> 02:18:21.06
She ended up joining the army. Yes, she was a so you got third generation army

1686
02:18:21.70 --> 02:18:28.74
That's true and she actually shipped off to Afghanistan at one point correct right she was a chemical officer

1687
02:18:29.70 --> 02:18:31.70
And how hard was that for you?

1688
02:18:31.70 --> 02:18:32.98
have this tough

1689
02:18:32.98 --> 02:18:37.14
I know it's tough on her and it's tough on me, you know, I just you know

1690
02:18:37.14 --> 02:18:42.98
It's it's one thing you know when you when you go but it's when your daughter goes

1691
02:18:42.98 --> 02:18:49.46
You got a lot of other thoughts going through the mind and now she's very strong woman

1692
02:18:50.02 --> 02:18:56.18
She was with a college at Warrensburg and she was the first ROTC

1693
02:18:57.22 --> 02:18:59.46
Famiel come the Italian commander

1694
02:18:59.86 --> 02:19:06.26
She was the first female to go to jump school from there and the first one to go to Afghanistan

1695
02:19:07.70 --> 02:19:11.70
And now she's a deputy sheriff on johnson canny Kansas and

1696
02:19:11.70 --> 02:19:17.06
She's a loves of job. Must be the daughter of a son, too, Raider

1697
02:19:20.50 --> 02:19:23.30
Got a daughter of slay, I guess you know

1698
02:19:24.50 --> 02:19:29.70
Other always worried about her but I tried not to show my concerns

1699
02:19:30.50 --> 02:19:34.82
But it was when your daughter's in her's way you got to be a little

1700
02:19:34.82 --> 02:19:42.10
Crazy I worry when my daughter's one of my daughters goes to the grocery store right where I came to the

1701
02:19:42.10 --> 02:19:50.10
Magister go to Afghanistan, God bless you and you know that's the the last life lesson that you have in the book

1702
02:19:52.42 --> 02:19:54.82
You say life lesson nine sacrificial living

1703
02:19:55.86 --> 02:20:02.66
That scene as we arrived at Pope Air Force Base back in November 1970 really made an impression on me

1704
02:20:02.66 --> 02:20:10.50
It's not only the soldiers but also their wives who are heroes these families are the type of people our world needs

1705
02:20:11.30 --> 02:20:15.70
People who know this life is not just about their own convenience

1706
02:20:16.74 --> 02:20:19.78
I am thankful for what these families and also

1707
02:20:20.42 --> 02:20:26.42
Those of first responders in civilian life do for our country and for freedom around the world

1708
02:20:27.86 --> 02:20:29.86
That's your

1709
02:20:29.86 --> 02:20:35.06
That's sort of your your final life lesson there and like I said the stories in the book

1710
02:20:36.90 --> 02:20:42.34
We only covered a fraction of the book today, but it's packed full of more information the

1711
02:20:43.62 --> 02:20:45.62
just it's

1712
02:20:46.18 --> 02:20:48.18
Very powerful

1713
02:20:48.74 --> 02:20:50.02
And

1714
02:20:50.02 --> 02:20:55.94
One thing I wanted to cover which we we haven't really touched on yet which is the impact of the raid

1715
02:20:55.94 --> 02:21:00.50
Right because clearly go on this operation the operation is to rescue

1716
02:21:01.62 --> 02:21:09.14
Peotab use and as we've covered there was no POWs there and it'd be easy to think well then that must be a failed mission

1717
02:21:10.18 --> 02:21:11.22
But

1718
02:21:11.22 --> 02:21:16.34
That couldn't be further from the truth the there was a huge impact for

1719
02:21:16.90 --> 02:21:21.38
The POWs and and part of the section of the book where you have other people stories

1720
02:21:21.78 --> 02:21:23.78
You have a bunch of commentary from

1721
02:21:23.78 --> 02:21:30.74
Some of the people at were POWs and Vietnam and we've had some of these heroes on this podcast incredible human beings

1722
02:21:32.02 --> 02:21:34.98
You have some I'm gonna just read some of these highlights

1723
02:21:35.30 --> 02:21:43.94
US Air Force first lieutenant J H spike Nazmith POW from 1966 to 1973 says I was in a Hanoi

1724
02:21:44.34 --> 02:21:46.34
Six and a half years

1725
02:21:46.34 --> 02:21:49.46
After the raid the guards were clearly shaken by what they heard

1726
02:21:49.46 --> 02:21:55.14
They were digging holes like mad it was a real show to watch at dawn the NVA were still running around

1727
02:21:55.78 --> 02:21:59.94
You've heard of a Chinese fire drill. They're digging fox holes right outside our cell

1728
02:22:00.26 --> 02:22:05.54
They've got machine guns set up all over the prison yard. They're digging in fox holes real deep. I can't believe all the freaking

1729
02:22:05.86 --> 02:22:09.86
Foxholes first time I'd seen the little bastard to work up a sweat

1730
02:22:12.50 --> 02:22:16.02
US Air Force first lieutenant Joe Kreka POW

1731
02:22:16.02 --> 02:22:19.38
1966 to 1973 on the night of November 21st

1732
02:22:19.70 --> 02:22:26.18
1970 hours a POW and camp faith a camp just about 10 miles south of sauntay and about the same distance west

1733
02:22:27.06 --> 02:22:29.06
of Hanoi as sauntay

1734
02:22:29.78 --> 02:22:33.62
It didn't come out until a few days later what had happened within 48 hours

1735
02:22:33.62 --> 02:22:38.10
We were all packed up placed on the six by six trucks and ferried into Hanoi

1736
02:22:39.46 --> 02:22:43.70
So this is an impact direct impact of the raid they started consolidating these prisoners

1737
02:22:43.70 --> 02:22:50.18
Which is a massive morale boost he says whereas before we had been held in much smaller groups one two three four

1738
02:22:50.74 --> 02:22:57.78
Or even eight or ten they were now 50 of us all together in a room of about 35 feet by 70 feet new faces

1739
02:22:58.10 --> 02:23:02.66
new stories to tell and hear and putting faces of fellow Americans we only knew by main

1740
02:23:03.54 --> 02:23:07.62
Language classes were taught in German because they they organized like a

1741
02:23:07.62 --> 02:23:13.30
Educational system once they were together they had a just just they started being more productive

1742
02:23:14.42 --> 02:23:19.78
Language classes were taught in German Spanish and even Russian math classes were divided into three levels appropriately

1743
02:23:20.18 --> 02:23:22.18
xy and z

1744
02:23:22.58 --> 02:23:26.82
We also had courses in history sociology politics religion wine selection

1745
02:23:26.82 --> 02:23:30.50
Yes, we had a wine tasting class meat cutting and lumber selection

1746
02:23:30.50 --> 02:23:39.06
And I taught of a course in physics automotive theory and practices well as one on classical music themes and composers

1747
02:23:40.10 --> 02:23:46.26
He said we were still being held captive but since the raid on song tape prison camp by the in comparable

1748
02:23:46.34 --> 02:23:51.62
Sontay Raiders life was so much better hats off to all the Raiders and those who supported the raid

1749
02:23:51.94 --> 02:23:56.74
Air force navy Marines and all those at their support bases on land at sea bravo

1750
02:23:56.74 --> 02:24:03.14
Another one captain a US Air Force captain Leon Lee Ellis

1751
02:24:04.26 --> 02:24:10.98
Sontay POW camp from 1967 to 1973 the night of November 20th and 21st at camp faith

1752
02:24:11.06 --> 02:24:14.74
We POWs were awakened in the middle of night hearing explosions aircraft

1753
02:24:15.14 --> 02:24:20.50
Sams launching and several minutes of chaos we could not have guessed that our old camp at Sontay

1754
02:24:20.50 --> 02:24:24.90
Just a few miles up the road was entertaining guests uninvited guests for sure

1755
02:24:24.90 --> 02:24:30.66
The next morning we saw fear in the eyes of the guards and turn keys and within 48 hours

1756
02:24:30.66 --> 02:24:35.06
We were loaded up and move back to Hanoi for the first time ever we were in large groups

1757
02:24:36.26 --> 02:24:42.82
But we were not rescued by the raid in many ways our sanity and teamwork were saved by that event

1758
02:24:42.82 --> 02:24:47.46
We will always be indebted to the Raiders for what they did for us

1759
02:24:47.46 --> 02:24:56.10
US Navy Lieutenant Junior Grade Porter Halle Burton POW 1965 to 1973 at camp faith on November 21st

1760
02:24:56.26 --> 02:25:00.82
We heard gunfire and jet noise from somewhere close by but had no idea what was happening

1761
02:25:00.82 --> 02:25:06.10
The elation we felt knowing that our government had tried to rescue us was the most powerful

1762
02:25:06.10 --> 02:25:08.26
More morale booster imaginable

1763
02:25:08.26 --> 02:25:18.42
We were especially thankful to the guys of the Sontay Raiders who had volunteered for this mission and risked their lives to try and rescue us

1764
02:25:18.42 --> 02:25:21.14
Another one US Navy Commander Paul Galante

1765
02:25:21.78 --> 02:25:23.78
Sontay POW camp

1766
02:25:24.58 --> 02:25:29.78
He said the Sontay raid itself was the most memorable moment of my captivity

1767
02:25:30.26 --> 02:25:35.22
We knew Uncle Sam wouldn't forget about us the Sontay raid proof that

1768
02:25:35.22 --> 02:25:42.74
US Air Force first Lieutenant Mike Burns POW 1968 to 1973

1769
02:25:42.74 --> 02:25:46.90
We were all jubilant because after so many years of waiting something finally happened

1770
02:25:46.90 --> 02:25:51.70
Fighter pilots like to make things happen and are probably the worst probably worse than most people are doing nothing

1771
02:25:53.70 --> 02:25:56.74
US Air Force Major DW Wayne Wadell

1772
02:25:56.74 --> 02:26:06.50
POW 1967 in 1973 you guys made the biggest positive change in our so-jurn in North Vietnam and we can never

1773
02:26:07.06 --> 02:26:09.70
Repay you for taking that risk thanks

1774
02:26:12.42 --> 02:26:14.42
And I'll read one more this is US Air Force

1775
02:26:15.78 --> 02:26:18.90
First Lieutenant Larry lucky shells chestly

1776
02:26:19.86 --> 02:26:21.46
Sontay POW camp

1777
02:26:21.46 --> 02:26:31.14
1966 to 1973 I was captured in 1966 and spent the next 2,495 days just short of 7 years as a POW

1778
02:26:31.94 --> 02:26:32.98
I was at Sontay

1779
02:26:33.94 --> 02:26:38.26
We had prayed for months that God would move us to a better camp he did on July 14th

1780
02:26:38.26 --> 02:26:41.62
I guess a person needs to be careful what he prays for he might get it

1781
02:26:41.62 --> 02:26:45.22
We loaded in the trucks and went to a better camp which fulfilled our prayers

1782
02:26:45.78 --> 02:26:51.30
Then the raid came we were blessed once more when we were moved to a better camp at Hanoi where we had big

1783
02:26:51.30 --> 02:26:56.66
rooms about 48 of us in the room we could now teach each other things such as languages,

1784
02:26:56.66 --> 02:27:03.38
choir, movie, we told movies and we had programs on each Sunday and also for Christmas

1785
02:27:03.38 --> 02:27:05.70
Easter 4th of July Marine Day etc

1786
02:27:06.34 --> 02:27:11.30
When we got packages and that was not very often those who got packages shared them with those

1787
02:27:11.86 --> 02:27:18.66
That received nothing I never received any packages or letters for four years yes for four years my wife and family did not know

1788
02:27:18.66 --> 02:27:27.54
If I was alive or dead I am eternally grateful to the heroic things that the men of the Sontay raid did for our country

1789
02:27:28.34 --> 02:27:30.98
And those incarcerated in Vietnam

1790
02:27:34.82 --> 02:27:38.50
I remember that came the fourth era I lied come in

1791
02:27:39.70 --> 02:27:41.70
Their model was returned with order

1792
02:27:44.18 --> 02:27:46.18
Yeah, it's outstanding

1793
02:27:46.18 --> 02:27:53.54
Yeah, and as I said I was just hitting the highlights I didn't even cover all these POWs the the impact that you all had

1794
02:27:54.18 --> 02:28:00.90
Conducting this operation which by the way I've been mentioned the operation name was ivory coast that was the name of the operation

1795
02:28:04.18 --> 02:28:09.78
But you know the impact that you all had was just incredible and

1796
02:28:09.78 --> 02:28:18.26
Amazing to be able to sit here and and talk to you some someone from a raid that I've studied and read about for many many years

1797
02:28:19.38 --> 02:28:21.38
And just an incredible

1798
02:28:22.10 --> 02:28:26.26
Opportunity to be able to sit here and talk to you and and hear these stories

1799
02:28:27.54 --> 02:28:29.70
From you for everybody out there

1800
02:28:30.58 --> 02:28:38.66
The book is just incredible piece of history and it's it's available on Kindle if you're one of these digital people there's an audio book

1801
02:28:38.66 --> 02:28:40.66
Traditional print

1802
02:28:41.46 --> 02:28:49.14
You know whether you want soft cover hard cover, but just an incredible book go out and get it we just covered a fraction of the stories today

1803
02:28:51.06 --> 02:28:54.94
It's an amazing amazing piece of history. Thank you

1804
02:28:56.18 --> 02:29:00.62
Probably a good place to wrap it up echo Charles. Do you have any questions?

1805
02:29:00.62 --> 02:29:06.90
Nothing else than okay. Thank you. Wow. That's that's a rare occasion

1806
02:29:06.90 --> 02:29:12.74
What was gonna ask about the wine tasting but that was a year thing right no that way after ask a Captain Charlie Plummer

1807
02:29:12.74 --> 02:29:18.82
Yeah, maybe will reader bill reader about that one do we know what we learn in a wine tasting class

1808
02:29:19.62 --> 02:29:26.10
Do anyone know that probably different ways that wine are made to taste different ways and

1809
02:29:26.98 --> 02:29:31.22
No, I keep those people when you talk to the POWs we've talked to POWs the

1810
02:29:31.22 --> 02:29:33.22
The

1811
02:29:33.78 --> 02:29:41.50
The amount of focus that they have on food is incredible they go through everything that they've ever eaten in their whole lives

1812
02:29:41.50 --> 02:29:47.70
Literally they have they'll talk about menu. They'll prepare a Christmas Eve dinner menu for months

1813
02:29:47.70 --> 02:29:50.54
Right and just think about what they're gonna eat

1814
02:29:50.54 --> 02:29:52.86
I mean because those guys were getting fed

1815
02:29:52.86 --> 02:29:57.14
You know these little balls of rice with piece chips that wouldn't it?

1816
02:29:57.14 --> 02:30:01.22
Yeah, they'd be happy if there was a bug in there because they'd get a little extra protein. Oh, good

1817
02:30:02.18 --> 02:30:07.22
Yeah, that's amazing. I know I do to have those guys back on the podcast

1818
02:30:07.22 --> 02:30:12.26
It'll be it'll be awesome to be able to ask them you know what they remember about about this and how it impacted them

1819
02:30:12.26 --> 02:30:17.38
But amazing story Terry you got any final thoughts you want to share no

1820
02:30:17.38 --> 02:30:18.42
I

1821
02:30:18.42 --> 02:30:22.34
You know it was a team effort from the guys that supporting us

1822
02:30:22.34 --> 02:30:26.98
I mean when you think about how many people were involved in the Sunday raid

1823
02:30:28.02 --> 02:30:32.26
56 guys were on the ground but we had I'm say

1824
02:30:32.82 --> 02:30:37.54
56 hundred helping us guys that were on the ships, you know, we had

1825
02:30:38.74 --> 02:30:43.70
The aircraft came from three different

1826
02:30:46.74 --> 02:30:48.74
Airpoint

1827
02:30:48.74 --> 02:30:52.42
carriers and I think it was six or seven

1828
02:30:53.46 --> 02:30:55.46
bases and

1829
02:30:55.46 --> 02:30:59.70
It was a joint effort. I mean there are so many people involved in it

1830
02:31:00.10 --> 02:31:02.10
But what's interesting is

1831
02:31:02.10 --> 02:31:07.54
Nobody knew what was going on. They're all compartmentalized. They were all compartmentalized

1832
02:31:09.30 --> 02:31:10.66
Colonel

1833
02:31:10.66 --> 02:31:12.66
Sidnor or Colonel

1834
02:31:13.78 --> 02:31:15.78
Simon's and

1835
02:31:15.78 --> 02:31:19.22
Cheryl Manor had a letter from the

1836
02:31:19.46 --> 02:31:24.42
Joint Chiefs of Staff that said if these guys need anything

1837
02:31:25.38 --> 02:31:31.22
Give it to them no questions ask and that's what they had carried to every base they went to

1838
02:31:31.94 --> 02:31:37.06
And there was no questions they never was turned down on anything they requested and

1839
02:31:37.78 --> 02:31:40.98
You know, so that's how high in that

1840
02:31:40.98 --> 02:31:48.74
Heshalon and wit but also how many people lower in the Heshalon and the impact and helped with the

1841
02:31:48.74 --> 02:31:54.26
Sunday raid and some of them probably didn't even know they were doing it because of the secrecy

1842
02:31:54.58 --> 02:31:57.62
You barely knew you were doing it until if you were to go for it

1843
02:31:58.18 --> 02:32:03.54
Yeah, that's the part you know an hour before we took off is when we knew where we were going

1844
02:32:04.66 --> 02:32:06.18
So

1845
02:32:06.18 --> 02:32:08.18
Let's security was for our own benefit

1846
02:32:08.18 --> 02:32:13.38
Absolutely, so you know, I'm never questioned why they kept out of secret

1847
02:32:14.02 --> 02:32:16.42
I was just glad they did you know, so

1848
02:32:17.38 --> 02:32:22.02
Well, I'm glad we can hear about the secret now and thank you for joining us out here

1849
02:32:22.02 --> 02:32:29.06
My pleasure has been a real honor to be in all the veterans out there. Thank you for your service to the

1850
02:32:29.06 --> 02:32:34.66
Great Country. I know we got some ruffy roads out there, but we also have been through them

1851
02:32:34.66 --> 02:32:41.22
Before we will survive we just have to pick up our bootstraps and chug on

1852
02:32:42.90 --> 02:32:47.14
Well, you you all have given us lessons learned and then

1853
02:32:48.26 --> 02:32:54.26
Thank you for your for your service and for your contribution to America and for your contribution to

1854
02:32:55.06 --> 02:33:00.18
Special forces and really to special operations as a whole as I said

1855
02:33:00.18 --> 02:33:05.94
You and your your brothers and arms that conducted this this operation

1856
02:33:06.82 --> 02:33:08.82
You made a huge impact

1857
02:33:09.38 --> 02:33:17.38
Not only like I said to the POWs, but you made a huge impact to the morale of a country and you made a huge impact to

1858
02:33:17.94 --> 02:33:21.54
Special operations and arched victory in history

1859
02:33:22.58 --> 02:33:23.62
So

1860
02:33:23.62 --> 02:33:29.26
Thank you for coming on and thank you for everything that you and your fellow son

1861
02:33:29.26 --> 02:33:31.26
T-Raters have done

1862
02:33:31.90 --> 02:33:35.10
We will not forget you thank you sir. Thank you

1863
02:33:37.42 --> 02:33:39.02
And with that

1864
02:33:39.02 --> 02:33:42.06
Terry Buckler has left the building

1865
02:33:43.34 --> 02:33:46.62
Pretty awesome to be able to sit down and talk to him echo

1866
02:33:46.62 --> 02:33:48.62
Yeah, how do you feel about it?

1867
02:33:48.62 --> 02:33:50.78
It's interesting how do you feel about that whole

1868
02:33:51.82 --> 02:33:53.10
scenario

1869
02:33:53.10 --> 02:33:55.74
Not knowing where you're going to execute

1870
02:33:55.74 --> 02:34:01.66
This massive mission and you don't know where you're going until an hour before you go yeah

1871
02:34:02.38 --> 02:34:06.14
Yeah, obviously kind of there's a lot to think about it

1872
02:34:06.94 --> 02:34:13.10
To start with where it's one of those things where it's almost like you're my I would imagine anyway that you're mine just kind of goes to okay

1873
02:34:13.74 --> 02:34:20.46
I'm here to essentially do a mission and so it kind of blocks that of course you can be wondering I would imagine I don't know

1874
02:34:20.46 --> 02:34:23.34
But of course you're imagining what you're gonna do but

1875
02:34:23.34 --> 02:34:27.50
Either way, it's like it forces your mind to just be prepared for kind of anything

1876
02:34:28.94 --> 02:34:30.94
But it's still very off-plitting

1877
02:34:32.06 --> 02:34:40.94
To know this is what I thought about even more so though than that is so you know how he started the his business afterwards

1878
02:34:41.26 --> 02:34:45.66
Right and it's like oh it just ties in like documents. It's like oh, right you didn't

1879
02:34:45.66 --> 02:34:52.14
Start like some tactical shooting course just you know something like but it just goes to show where like

1880
02:34:53.74 --> 02:34:56.38
Even tilt wasn't he like a reporter after all

1881
02:34:57.66 --> 02:35:04.30
For a full career by the way. Yeah, so it just goes to show like how a military man

1882
02:35:05.02 --> 02:35:07.02
Kind of like a due to man

1883
02:35:07.02 --> 02:35:08.38
Is like

1884
02:35:08.38 --> 02:35:31.74
Right you don't know like he he can be anybody and he can go and perform and do these crazy things hold the

1885
02:35:31.74 --> 02:35:38.22
Construction guy or maybe like some some real hard job and he's like oh no, he's an accountant

1886
02:35:39.66 --> 02:35:44.54
Okay, all right Eddie it just paints that picture more. Yeah, you know and there's something to be said for

1887
02:35:45.10 --> 02:35:52.06
That's the way veterans have done it for a long time. I mean the world war two veterans came home and they

1888
02:35:53.02 --> 02:35:58.22
Went and got jobs doing things, you know, they went back to school. They did the GI bill

1889
02:35:58.22 --> 02:36:03.98
So like you don't have to you know not everyone's gonna come home and start a tactical shooting company

1890
02:36:04.22 --> 02:36:05.18
You know like that's not

1891
02:36:06.22 --> 02:36:12.62
That's not the normal thing what makes it seem normal is you know when someone owns a tactical shooting company that they were a veteran

1892
02:36:12.62 --> 02:36:18.30
So you're like oh well everyone that's a veteran must start a tactical shooting company. Yeah, it's not necessarily true

1893
02:36:18.94 --> 02:36:26.46
So feels that's a feels that way feels like it feels that way because there's no one that went to college and studied

1894
02:36:26.46 --> 02:36:28.46
You know

1895
02:36:28.46 --> 02:36:31.98
Studied economics and then started a tactical shooting company, right?

1896
02:36:31.98 --> 02:36:35.02
Good sir, so you don't you don't have that data in your head

1897
02:36:35.66 --> 02:36:40.62
So you think well, oh this guy's got a tactical shooting company. He was a veteran another guy has a tactical shooting company

1898
02:36:40.62 --> 02:36:45.82
He's a veteran another guy so all veterans must start tactical shooting companies. No a lot of veterans go and

1899
02:36:46.38 --> 02:36:50.62
Start well data processing companies and

1900
02:36:50.62 --> 02:36:56.38
I work with I mean I work with a lot of companies where I work with veterans all the time that that

1901
02:36:57.50 --> 02:37:00.54
You know we're talking about their business. We're talking about what they do and then occasionally

1902
02:37:00.54 --> 02:37:07.42
Oh yeah, well, I was near army or oh I was in the Marine Corps and they have a totally separate job and they have a different career

1903
02:37:07.42 --> 02:37:11.42
And that's very normal. It's not abnormal

1904
02:37:12.22 --> 02:37:18.06
Yeah, it's actually more normal. It's more normal to do that than it is to start a tactical shooting company

1905
02:37:18.06 --> 02:37:22.06
Very it's more normal. Yeah, and even and this more to

1906
02:37:22.94 --> 02:37:26.62
I don't mean to put to find a viewpoint on it, but of course tactical shooting company, okay?

1907
02:37:26.62 --> 02:37:33.18
But like any kind of adventurous and this is brought just my experience like the bias I came from my experience with meeting all these guys

1908
02:37:33.18 --> 02:37:35.18
We're gonna make a think doing all these

1909
02:37:36.22 --> 02:37:41.90
Adventurous things, you know, where it's like you go through these crazy missions or all these crazy military experiences

1910
02:37:41.90 --> 02:37:43.42
You come home and boom

1911
02:37:43.42 --> 02:37:46.30
Let's switch missions into some other quote-unquote

1912
02:37:46.30 --> 02:37:48.30
Adventurous

1913
02:37:48.30 --> 02:37:53.02
scenario, you know and a lot of people a lot of us or not us, but a lot of people do that

1914
02:37:53.02 --> 02:37:55.82
Yeah, you see that you know, I think it's your awareness bias

1915
02:37:55.82 --> 02:38:01.82
Yeah, because when you become aware of something that sounds like that you've got what's that person's background?

1916
02:38:01.82 --> 02:38:06.70
Oh, they were a veteran that makes sense. Yeah, you don't look at an accountant and say whoa

1917
02:38:06.70 --> 02:38:10.94
I wonder what military branch they were when they probably were that were there

1918
02:38:10.94 --> 02:38:12.94
There's a decent chance that they were in the military

1919
02:38:12.94 --> 02:38:20.70
There's all kinds of veterans out there working. I mean I meet veterans all the time when I go and work with companies companies just so you know

1920
02:38:21.34 --> 02:38:22.70
Companies have

1921
02:38:22.70 --> 02:38:29.02
Veteran programs inside their company. So I'll work with a financial company and inside their financial company

1922
02:38:29.02 --> 02:38:33.18
They have like a veterans group and they'll say hey can we spend 15 minutes doing Q&A with you?

1923
02:38:33.74 --> 02:38:37.34
And I go oh with who and they go oh we have a veterans group. We have you know of our

1924
02:38:37.90 --> 02:38:39.42
2000 employees we have

1925
02:38:39.42 --> 02:38:42.06
274 veterans and we

1926
02:38:42.06 --> 02:38:44.06
We sell

1927
02:38:44.06 --> 02:38:45.66
Insurance or we

1928
02:38:45.66 --> 02:38:52.38
Manufacturer widgets or whatever, but they have a bunch of veterans at work there and that's every I mean when I work with big tech companies

1929
02:38:52.38 --> 02:38:55.18
They have veterans when I work with financial companies they have a construction company

1930
02:38:55.18 --> 02:38:56.70
Everyone's got veterans

1931
02:38:56.70 --> 02:39:02.14
It's just that it stands out in your head when someone owns a shooting company because you think it's cool

1932
02:39:03.50 --> 02:39:07.58
So it's normal for a veteran to come home and do what they're gonna do

1933
02:39:07.90 --> 02:39:10.14
That's that's the way the world works

1934
02:39:10.14 --> 02:39:14.54
But and this is a good example. It's the interesting thing about his career was just

1935
02:39:15.82 --> 02:39:20.38
It's it's almost like this guy was in the NFL for

1936
02:39:21.50 --> 02:39:25.42
One season and he didn't play any games except the Super Bowl

1937
02:39:26.46 --> 02:39:31.98
Right like that's the kind of incredible and then he and then that was it he retired after the Super Bowl one game

1938
02:39:32.62 --> 02:39:35.34
And went out there one the championship and

1939
02:39:35.34 --> 02:39:39.82
And and then carried on with the rest of his life did three years

1940
02:39:41.42 --> 02:39:48.66
Three years like and doing that such a such a high profile mission probably one of the most well

1941
02:39:48.66 --> 02:39:52.38
The most high profile mission for special operations at that time

1942
02:39:53.82 --> 02:39:55.82
It's amazing

1943
02:39:55.82 --> 02:39:57.82
It's crazy so

1944
02:39:58.06 --> 02:40:04.26
Good stuff awesome to be able to talk with him and this is a hugely influential mission for special operations

1945
02:40:04.26 --> 02:40:09.22
We appreciate you support us by the way out there

1946

1947
02:40:17.38 --> 02:40:22.34
Freaking I did not get a lot of sleep last night got she got stuck in my

1948
02:40:23.38 --> 02:40:29.82
in my roller coaster of brain thought which is it which is not I can't stand it you know

1949
02:40:29.82 --> 02:40:36.54
I can't stand it and I the here's what was a bummer was I had bad sleep the night before and I was like

1950
02:40:36.54 --> 02:40:40.86
Oh, I had a good workout. So I thought I'm gonna be asleep like a baby and I'm going to bed early

1951
02:40:41.26 --> 02:40:44.86
Like you know 930. I'm getting ready to go to sleep

1952
02:40:44.86 --> 02:40:49.90
I'm thinking all this is gonna be great. I'm gonna feel great. I went to bed, but you know 10 10

1953
02:40:50.54 --> 02:40:56.70
I'm laying in bed in the darkness and I've got the eyes are shifting back and forth

1954
02:40:56.70 --> 02:41:01.34
You know count the walls and thinking about this and thinking about that and thinking about this and thinking about that and thinking about this

1955
02:41:01.34 --> 02:41:03.82
So that happened until one o'clock in the morning

1956
02:41:03.82 --> 02:41:12.14
Which so when that happens then okay, so this because that happens that's a real thing where but is it the kind of where you think about one or two things over and over and over

1957
02:41:12.14 --> 02:41:14.14
I can describe this

1958
02:41:14.14 --> 02:41:16.14
This is the way it feels

1959
02:41:16.14 --> 02:41:18.14
have you ever been to

1960
02:41:18.94 --> 02:41:21.10
Disney land no okay

1961
02:41:21.10 --> 02:41:25.42
There's a ride there. It's called space mountain and in space mountain

1962
02:41:25.42 --> 02:41:29.58
You're on a roller coaster, but you can't see very much in front of you. It's in the dark basically

1963
02:41:30.06 --> 02:41:34.46
So you're suddenly you're going in one direction and you'd go in a different direction and go in a different direction

1964
02:41:35.02 --> 02:41:37.42
So that's what my mind is like I'm on

1965
02:41:37.90 --> 02:41:42.70
I'm on a roller coaster it at dark, but I just keep seeing like a new idea comes up then another new idea

1966
02:41:42.70 --> 02:41:45.66
I have another new idea then another new idea and it just doesn't stop

1967
02:41:46.46 --> 02:41:50.94
And maybe sometimes it does circle back to the original idea which just starts the whole process again

1968
02:41:51.82 --> 02:41:53.66
but I am

1969
02:41:53.66 --> 02:41:59.98
Getting I probably slept two and a half hours last night which which sucks. I wanted to sleep more, but

1970
02:42:01.10 --> 02:42:07.82
Here I am here I am so and I drank this I normally don't have two goes in one podcast

1971
02:42:08.38 --> 02:42:10.38
But I did to best so

1972
02:42:11.02 --> 02:42:13.02
You may need some clean energy in your life

1973
02:42:14.22 --> 02:42:20.46
You don't need to have necessarily some jittery energy you don't need to have you need to have sugar intake

1974
02:42:20.86 --> 02:42:22.86
You need to give yourself type two diabetes

1975
02:42:22.86 --> 02:42:26.38
You can just get yourself a go get yourself a go

1976
02:42:26.78 --> 02:42:31.02
Jock off you'll calm get yourself some more come on to go home and have more because I have any yet because I have

1977
02:42:31.02 --> 02:42:33.02
Yeah, so

1978
02:42:33.02 --> 02:42:37.74
We're feeling that yeah, and especially I said this before it's but if if you're lifting wait

1979
02:42:38.22 --> 02:42:43.90
Or or each I did lift this morning by the way bad workout not a great workout like I mean

1980
02:42:44.54 --> 02:42:46.54
I was borderline hey

1981
02:42:47.10 --> 02:42:49.90
Am I gonna get the benefit from this workout right now?

1982
02:42:49.90 --> 02:42:53.90
Yeah, yeah, so how many days of like

1983
02:42:54.46 --> 02:43:00.78
Cheaty sleep do you have to go through to actually get a better because you can go one day junk sleep and still get a sick workout

1984
02:43:00.94 --> 02:43:06.22
Yeah, I don't know I don't know but I will get good sleep tonight. That's the nice thing

1985
02:43:06.22 --> 02:43:11.26
Rough for me two days if I go the second day bad sleep. Sorry workouts workout

1986
02:43:11.26 --> 02:43:17.26
It's not even doing yeah, just workout it depends on what what I kind of if I if I

1987
02:43:17.26 --> 02:43:24.54
Go into it and get kind of like a little bit of anger going then I'm pissed then I might get Jackson more still

1988
02:43:24.54 --> 02:43:29.02
But I did a week workout, but do you are any of your work because this is different gonna work out

1989
02:43:29.02 --> 02:43:31.98
But are any of your workouts like based on

1990
02:43:33.74 --> 02:43:39.74
For lack of a term like a body building scenario. Okay, so yeah, put it this way then and tell me if this applies to you your workouts for you

1991
02:43:39.74 --> 02:43:41.74
So if I do I don't know

1992
02:43:41.74 --> 02:43:49.18
Chest one day where we are and then I don't feel the pump and I'm tired

1993
02:43:49.42 --> 02:43:51.82
That is like there's something wrong with me physically

1994
02:43:51.98 --> 02:43:54.78
Whether I didn't get enough sleep, but I didn't eat enough and not hydrate or whatever

1995
02:43:54.78 --> 02:43:59.18
But if you don't get the pump that's a big indicator and then there's other stuff where it's like you just feel weak

1996
02:43:59.18 --> 02:44:02.38
And just not into it mentally all the stuff there's other other factors

1997
02:44:02.62 --> 02:44:08.86
But do you have any work out where it's like you're you feel the physical like pump versus if you don't

1998
02:44:08.86 --> 02:44:12.30
I'd say it kind of feel that on a lot of workouts

1999
02:44:13.02 --> 02:44:19.34
You know yeah like dips you feel dips you feel good put but muscle ups too like when you get done with muscle ups

2000
02:44:19.34 --> 02:44:21.66
You feel like kind of jacked all the way around

2001
02:44:23.18 --> 02:44:27.42
Yeah, so you know when chasing gardeners at the other day that he takes a one

2002
02:44:27.58 --> 02:44:32.38
Discipline go pill in the morning that's he I haven't tried it yet, but that seems like a good move

2003
02:44:32.94 --> 02:44:34.94
Just to get a little a little kicker

2004
02:44:34.94 --> 02:44:43.10
Yeah, I haven't tried it yet. I have them before I'm like going to speak and I don't want to have a bladder filled with liquid

2005
02:44:43.58 --> 02:44:47.42
Distracting you but you can feel those things feel those things for real

The new hunting line thing when is that going down because look do I hunt you know, let's be be able

2015
02:45:31.98 --> 02:45:34.22
Probably not I think it's debate about it. Well, do

2016
02:45:35.58 --> 02:45:37.58
Either way

2017
02:45:37.58 --> 02:45:41.10
It can be used for other stuff. I will have something line

2018
02:45:42.54 --> 02:45:47.42
This summer late summer to be prepared for the hunting season in

2019
02:45:48.70 --> 02:45:49.66
September

2020
02:45:49.66 --> 02:45:56.54
That's hunting so well, there's there's other hunting but the hunting season we're aiming for is that September hunting season

2021
02:45:56.54 --> 02:46:04.06
So yeah, we're coming is there different hunting seasons for different places different places different animals different weapons

2022
02:46:05.18 --> 02:46:09.26
Okay, so there's a whole bunch of things and it can go

2023
02:46:10.14 --> 02:46:17.58
You know in yes different different animals different weapons different seasons

2024
02:46:17.58 --> 02:46:21.10
You've got a bunch of stuff to contend with and we'll be making stuff for all of it

2025
02:46:21.90 --> 02:46:24.54
very cool venture working with some great people

2026
02:46:25.58 --> 02:46:32.14
Work with camhains, which is awesome. I mean, he's just a machine so it's it's that guy is

2027
02:46:32.46 --> 02:46:38.06
Possessed and obsessed with hunting and so it's great to have him giving guidance on

2028
02:46:38.78 --> 02:46:40.78
making the gear exactly

2029
02:46:40.78 --> 02:46:48.14
As it should be made no compromise hey has to be able to perform if you're gonna keep up with camhains

2030
02:46:48.78 --> 02:46:54.14
In the woods like that clothing has to keep up with camhains that clothing is thinking to itself

2031
02:46:54.14 --> 02:46:56.62
All right, I'm gonna be put through the ringer

2032
02:46:57.18 --> 02:47:00.38
So that's what we're talking about. It's like the highest possible standard

2033
02:47:01.34 --> 02:47:05.58
Yeah, and like as it applies to actual hunting because let's face it when I'm looking at that thing

2034
02:47:05.58 --> 02:47:10.86
I'm pretty much only concerned about how it's gonna look on me. Really this is

2035
02:47:11.90 --> 02:47:14.78
Well when I'm doing whatever I'm being doing with it, but

2036
02:47:15.34 --> 02:47:20.78
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I mean I recently connected with him on my line too. So there you go

2037
02:47:21.02 --> 02:47:23.18
Got a new friend. Yep. Oh, yeah, yeah

2038
02:47:23.34 --> 02:47:29.10
So origin USA dot com if you want to check some of that stuff out. Yeah, also did you stuff. Oh, yeah, by the way, of course

2039
02:47:29.10 --> 02:47:38.54
That's a huge deal main and North Carolina where we're making it it's unbelievable

2040
02:47:39.18 --> 02:47:41.18
Bring it back

2041
02:47:41.18 --> 02:47:46.70
Also there you go. Jocca is a store jocco store dot com so you can get your just political freedom shirts and hats and merch

2042
02:47:47.10 --> 02:47:50.30
Good stuff. This quality. It's not just it's not just like

2043
02:47:51.74 --> 02:47:55.98
My daughter always says it's stuff. You know, it's weird how kids nowadays. Well

2044
02:47:55.98 --> 02:48:03.02
Let's face it my kids and their friends. I'm sure it's you know most kids were their terminology is like

2045
02:48:03.02 --> 02:48:07.26
You know merch is like obviously we know what that means. It's short from merchant dice

2046
02:48:07.26 --> 02:48:11.26
Which is merchandise is a specific thing. So we know the translation. They don't even know

2047
02:48:11.26 --> 02:48:17.58
They're just like merch. That's the official word. You know my daughters speak in a kind of their own language

2048
02:48:17.90 --> 02:48:22.54
With the and I went and saw one of my daughters up at my middle daughter up at college and got to listen to her

2049
02:48:22.54 --> 02:48:26.54
Her friends and they have their own words their own language

2050
02:48:27.10 --> 02:48:30.14
And it's pretty funny to listen to oh yeah sus

2051
02:48:30.94 --> 02:48:39.82
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, what is sus suspect yeah, which is suspicious like right? So we know that we know sus like on that look kind of sus

2052
02:48:39.82 --> 02:48:41.18
So I be like okay, obviously

2053
02:48:41.18 --> 02:48:42.46
That girl meets us

2054
02:48:42.46 --> 02:48:45.66
Fish is also like oh, that's a suspect situation

2055
02:48:45.66 --> 02:48:51.18
But some things could be sauce but suspect is a slang term derived from suspicious

2056
02:48:51.18 --> 02:48:58.70
All right because suspect as a word is a person no, but you could also say oh that that chair is suspect whether it's going to

2057
02:48:58.70 --> 02:49:01.26
You and say suspicious you say that thing is

2058
02:49:01.66 --> 02:49:07.90
Suspect oh you'd say suspicious you could say that you could say that I'm pretty sure suspect is a noun

2059
02:49:08.46 --> 02:49:15.10
Well, I guess we'll have to go to it's not the objective. I know you're an English major, but we want to revisit that

2060
02:49:15.10 --> 02:49:17.10
Here's my hypothesis

2061
02:49:17.10 --> 02:49:22.14
Suspicious is the adjective suspect is the noun sus is like

2062
02:49:23.42 --> 02:49:30.46
Could go both ways if a Malcolm of the whole deal all right, we're whole English literature

2063
02:49:30.70 --> 02:49:32.70
Understanding is sus at this time

2064
02:49:34.06 --> 02:49:38.22
Either way jockels door.com is where you can get all this merch

2065
02:49:39.26 --> 02:49:45.74
But it's more than just merch. It's like good it's quality. It's like well it's stuff you're supposed to actually wear and it's it's also

2066
02:49:45.74 --> 02:49:50.30
You know part you know spread of the game. It's part of like you know

2067
02:49:51.34 --> 02:49:56.38

Be patient but no end to be aggressive don't be a complainer don't be indispensable be thankful for those who sacrifice for our freedom and

2138
02:56:07.26 --> 02:56:09.26
Be prepared for death

2139
02:56:09.26 --> 02:56:17.26
Make sure the day that you meet your maker isn't the first time you've been introduced
