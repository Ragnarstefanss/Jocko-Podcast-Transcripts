00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.72
This is Jockel Podcast number 197 with Andrew Paul and me, Jockel willing. Good evening Andrew. Good evening

2
00:00:08.36 --> 00:00:11.40
For those of you that don't know Andrew Andrew

3
00:00:11.84 --> 00:00:19.08
What's one of my brothers from task unit? Bruser. He's now with us at echelon front and if you haven't heard podcast

4
00:00:19.60 --> 00:00:22.84
Number 42 that's when Andrew came on and

5
00:00:24.16 --> 00:00:26.16
talked about his experiences

6
00:00:26.16 --> 00:00:32.32
But we're not really interviewing Andrew today. He's just filling in for echel Charles

7
00:00:33.24 --> 00:00:35.88
Who's on vacation again?

8
00:00:37.08 --> 00:00:42.56
Vacation. Yeah, so that's why Andrew's here. So I have someone to talk to

9
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:45.04
Otherwise it gets lonely in the podcast room

10
00:00:46.32 --> 00:00:48.32
All right

11
00:00:48.32 --> 00:00:52.92
He've heard me say before if you know the way Broadway you see it and all things that's what

12
00:00:52.92 --> 00:00:55.64
A little quote from Musashi

13
00:00:57.48 --> 00:01:01.80
But beyond that when you pull the thread on things

14
00:01:03.40 --> 00:01:06.20
When you dig down and you dig in

15
00:01:08.28 --> 00:01:10.28
You find that things are are

16
00:01:11.20 --> 00:01:17.40
Not just similar. They're actually connected. There's a thread that runs through time and through history

17
00:01:18.04 --> 00:01:20.44
And there's a thread that runs through

18
00:01:21.48 --> 00:01:22.84
knowledge

19
00:01:22.84 --> 00:01:29.36
Knowledge itself and when you start connecting things you understand them better so there's some I see them all the time

20
00:01:30.76 --> 00:01:32.76
In about face my

21
00:01:32.76 --> 00:01:34.12
favorite book

22
00:01:34.12 --> 00:01:37.84
Colonel David Hacworth talks about one of his mentors

23
00:01:38.76 --> 00:01:41.32
The guy he served with and the guy named Glover Johns

24
00:01:42.68 --> 00:01:48.96
Who was a officer in the army who wrote a book that we covered on this podcast called the clay pigeons and St. Lo

25
00:01:48.96 --> 00:01:55.04
How how crazy is that connection? I had John Stryker, my run and

26
00:01:55.68 --> 00:02:01.08
When when he was on in one of his books he was talking about Elden Boswell a

27
00:02:02.04 --> 00:02:04.04
Sog operator

28
00:02:04.04 --> 00:02:08.88
That actually was a mentor to one of my mentors in the seal teams

29
00:02:10.08 --> 00:02:12.64
To connection how crazy is that?

30
00:02:13.44 --> 00:02:15.44
What about the fact that I

31
00:02:15.44 --> 00:02:18.40
read about and admired

32
00:02:18.96 --> 00:02:20.96
Dick Winners

33
00:02:20.96 --> 00:02:23.76
Commander the second of the 506 the band of brothers and Europe

34
00:02:25.04 --> 00:02:28.92
And then in Ramani we worked with the first of the 506

35
00:02:30.56 --> 00:02:32.96
So these connections there just everywhere

36
00:02:33.20 --> 00:02:41.08
There's everywhere you look things are connected now one of my favorite old field manuals is called FM

37
00:02:41.48 --> 00:02:44.84
100 attack five field service regulations

38
00:02:44.84 --> 00:02:51.80
It was issued by the Department of War on May 22nd, 1941 and it's an awesome

39
00:02:53.60 --> 00:03:01.48
Manual all kinds of information and I'm gonna cover it on the podcast, but the thing is the FM 100 attack five

40
00:03:02.56 --> 00:03:03.76
is not

41
00:03:03.76 --> 00:03:07.28
the most original document that I've ever seen and

42
00:03:07.28 --> 00:03:14.64
I've talked about the roots of maneuver warfare in fact we covered a book called maneuver warfare

43
00:03:15.76 --> 00:03:17.76
and the

44
00:03:17.76 --> 00:03:21.12
influence of the Prussian armies defeated the battle agenda

45
00:03:21.28 --> 00:03:23.60
You got general sharn horse and his

46
00:03:24.44 --> 00:03:26.44
influence on the Prussian

47
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.72
Military and thereby the German military well what's interesting is FM 100 attack five again

48
00:03:32.72 --> 00:03:38.76
This is an American field service regulations an American field manual it was so

49
00:03:39.32 --> 00:03:45.92
plagiarized it completely plagiarized from another document and this document

50
00:03:47.36 --> 00:03:49.04
is called

51
00:03:49.04 --> 00:03:54.20
Troopinfrug, which is my attempt at German Troopinfrug

52
00:03:54.72 --> 00:03:57.04
which basically translates to

53
00:03:57.04 --> 00:04:03.56
leading troops and it was first published in

54
00:04:04.56 --> 00:04:06.56
1933

55
00:04:06.56 --> 00:04:11.52
So we're talking about Nazi Germany and it was prepared by

56
00:04:12.64 --> 00:04:19.72
by a group of people a group of military men, but the leader of that group of military men was a guy named Colonel General

57
00:04:20.32 --> 00:04:22.32
Ludwig Beck

58
00:04:23.28 --> 00:04:25.28
now

59
00:04:25.28 --> 00:04:29.68
Nazi's obviously are a scourge to humanity

60
00:04:30.40 --> 00:04:34.24
But what's interesting is this guy General Beck was

61
00:04:35.24 --> 00:04:39.36
not a fan of the Nazis he wasn't really a fan of Hitler in fact

62
00:04:40.96 --> 00:04:49.52
He was eventually executed by the Nazis because he's one of the guys that coordinated and tried to

63
00:04:49.52 --> 00:04:56.24
Assassnate Hitler he's one of those guys and they figured it out and they assassinated him so

64
00:04:57.52 --> 00:04:59.52
He had some good character

65
00:05:01.52 --> 00:05:06.70
And he had of outstanding military sense he was educated kind of like the traditional

66
00:05:07.28 --> 00:05:11.44
Prussian military education served as a staff officer in World War I

67
00:05:12.64 --> 00:05:15.28
He was he he objected

68
00:05:15.28 --> 00:05:18.80
staunchly to the the

69
00:05:20.40 --> 00:05:26.96
Offence of Germany starting World War II he did not want to go and fight he realized that it was gonna be a problem

70
00:05:28.96 --> 00:05:34.80
And again he resigned in protest actually he resigned in protesting he tried to get a bunch of other people to resign

71
00:05:35.92 --> 00:05:37.92
and

72
00:05:37.92 --> 00:05:40.88
You know they kind of covered it up and made him walk away

73
00:05:40.88 --> 00:05:46.24
Then like I said eventually he tried to kill Hitler he tried to plot the kill Hitler in it and I think it was rumble

74
00:05:47.20 --> 00:05:52.40
Rommel was saying because rummel also participated in the attempt of assassination of

75
00:05:53.60 --> 00:05:56.000
Hitler which is why he got killed

76
00:05:56.16 --> 00:06:00.96
We'll go into that someday on the podcast. I'm sure they came to him and said hey

77
00:06:02.48 --> 00:06:06.04
You can come with us now and you'll die a hero

78
00:06:06.04 --> 00:06:12.60
Well, you have to kill yourself, but you know we won't say anything or we're gonna send you to court and make you a

79
00:06:13.88 --> 00:06:14.92
You know

80
00:06:14.92 --> 00:06:20.44
A public scapegoat for everything that's going wrong in Germany and he chose the former went out in the woods

81
00:06:20.92 --> 00:06:23.80
Said goodbye to his family went out in the woods and killed himself. That's

82
00:06:25.80 --> 00:06:28.92
That's Rommel so back was executed

83
00:06:28.92 --> 00:06:40.36
Um, but like I said his character obviously was a little bit you know what he had some some good character traits stood up for what he believed in and the fact that this book

84
00:06:40.44 --> 00:06:42.44
Trooping through them

85
00:06:43.40 --> 00:06:45.40
The fact that this book

86
00:06:45.64 --> 00:06:46.84
Is

87
00:06:46.84 --> 00:06:52.84
Has been so widely copied the Americans use something based on of the brits you something based the German still use something based on it

88
00:06:52.84 --> 00:07:00.28
Really kind of reveals his leadership knowledge so with that we'll go to the book

89
00:07:00.84 --> 00:07:06.20
The book Trooping through them am I getting better at saying that sounds good to me trooping for them

90
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.12
All right kicks off with the introduction the introduction starts with

91
00:07:14.04 --> 00:07:18.68
The conduct of war is an art depending upon free creative activity

92
00:07:18.68 --> 00:07:24.60
Scientifically grounded is that the way you think of it. I love that definition out of the gate

93
00:07:26.20 --> 00:07:28.20
War is art

94
00:07:29.32 --> 00:07:33.64
Depending on free creative activity scientifically grounded

95
00:07:34.20 --> 00:07:38.76
It makes the highest demands on the personality boom. It makes that makes complete sense to me

96
00:07:38.76 --> 00:07:40.04
Yeah, I know it does

97
00:07:40.04 --> 00:07:45.08
That I think the first time I said that was with Tim Ferriss at some point and I said

98
00:07:45.08 --> 00:07:49.96
I said war is an exercise in creativity. That's what I said and here you have

99
00:07:50.76 --> 00:07:57.80
Where I subconsciously or consciously stole that from or just found that to be true. Yes, or just found that because I'm going to people say oh

100
00:07:57.80 --> 00:08:02.76
Well, you know get to be a robot to be a soldier. It's actually not natural you will you will be destroyed

101
00:08:04.04 --> 00:08:07.24
Next the conduct of war is based on continuous development. Oh

102
00:08:07.24 --> 00:08:13.80
Oh check new means of warfare call forth ever changing employment

103
00:08:14.36 --> 00:08:19.08
Their use must be anticipated their influence must be correctly estimated and quickly utilized

104
00:08:19.88 --> 00:08:22.92
situations in war are of unlimited variety

105
00:08:23.24 --> 00:08:28.52
They change often and suddenly and only rarely are from the first discernible

106
00:08:30.44 --> 00:08:36.44
Incalculable elements are often of great influence the independent will of the enemy is

107
00:08:36.44 --> 00:08:38.44
Pitted against ours

108
00:08:41.32 --> 00:08:47.64
The independent will of the enemy is pitted against ours friction and mistakes are of every day occurrence

109
00:08:49.16 --> 00:08:51.16
So this guy is out of the gate

110
00:08:51.16 --> 00:08:53.48
You know he he knows what he's talking about

111
00:08:53.48 --> 00:08:58.36
Everyone of these things just nails it but what's always interesting of course is that

112
00:08:58.36 --> 00:09:05.88
He's talking about war, but guess what it applies to everything you do in life because guess what everything in life

113
00:09:06.76 --> 00:09:09.32
Is gonna change it's unlimited variety

114
00:09:10.04 --> 00:09:17.16
It's a test of wills there's friction and mistakes that occur every day no matter what you're doing your business with your family no matter what you're doing

115
00:09:17.72 --> 00:09:20.44
You are you are going to experience this

116
00:09:22.28 --> 00:09:25.08
The teaching of the conduct of war cannot be concentrated

117
00:09:25.08 --> 00:09:27.08
Exhaustively in regulations

118
00:09:29.48 --> 00:09:31.48
The principles so

119
00:09:31.48 --> 00:09:35.72
Inunciated must be employed dependent upon the situation

120
00:09:37.08 --> 00:09:39.08
so

121
00:09:39.40 --> 00:09:45.24
Exhaustively you cannot you cannot focus exhaustively on regulations which again as you just pointed out and drew the

122
00:09:46.20 --> 00:09:48.20
That's what people think

123
00:09:48.20 --> 00:09:52.28
That oh you're in the military you just follow orders no

124
00:09:52.28 --> 00:09:58.52
You have to be able to think in fact if all you do is follow regulations you're wrong

125
00:10:02.44 --> 00:10:04.44
Simplicity of conduct

126
00:10:06.44 --> 00:10:10.52
Logically carry through will most surely attain the objective

127
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.44
Yes

128
00:10:14.44 --> 00:10:19.32
war is the severeest test of spiritual and bodily strength in

129
00:10:19.32 --> 00:10:23.32
War character outways intellect

130
00:10:25.32 --> 00:10:29.40
Many stand forth on the field of battle who in peace would remain unnoticed

131
00:10:30.44 --> 00:10:32.44
That's an interesting

132
00:10:32.44 --> 00:10:40.20
Yeah, I didn't see that coming this intro. That's just I think what he's saying is

133
00:10:43.40 --> 00:10:47.24
That that person with the strong will that person with the strong character

134
00:10:47.24 --> 00:10:51.48
Amen, you can be a really smart person and be mentally weak

135
00:10:52.04 --> 00:10:57.24
All day long agreed discipline. Yes, so you can be super smart and when

136
00:10:57.88 --> 00:10:59.88
Things get crazy you're

137
00:11:00.36 --> 00:11:03.96
Shriveling up you're thinking too much right you're shrilling up in the corner

138
00:11:04.20 --> 00:11:08.60
Scared of what might happen where you if you're just a dude that has strong character

139
00:11:09.16 --> 00:11:11.16
Guess what you can step up and win

140
00:11:11.16 --> 00:11:18.20
And how about when if you can know all the right things to do but if you lack the fortitude and discipline

141
00:11:18.92 --> 00:11:26.84
To do it this you're it does like how many doctors know all the right things about health and yet maybe are not in great shape

142
00:11:27.24 --> 00:11:30.36
So they know the things to do but they don't do this as I'm saying kind of thing

143
00:11:31.40 --> 00:11:35.000
Maybe don't see this very often anymore, but like doctors that smoke

144
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.68
Well now I guess you just get doctors that eat crap right horrible, so yes

145
00:11:41.64 --> 00:11:44.92
Same thing so that that strength of character

146
00:11:47.08 --> 00:11:51.24
Doesn't matter you can overwhelm the super smart dude over in the corner

147
00:11:54.76 --> 00:11:56.76
Next

148
00:11:56.76 --> 00:12:04.28
Armies as well as lesser units demand lead and by the way if you can tell my reading is kind of stillted you know because

149
00:12:04.92 --> 00:12:11.72
It's translation so there's some weird words some weird orders of words that don't quite flow

150
00:12:12.68 --> 00:12:16.60
Which is why I was gonna read the the American manual 100-55 first

151
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.52
But no I decided to do this one first because it's more challenging. Well, it's funny though

152
00:12:20.52 --> 00:12:27.64
I when as you've been reading this already I haven't thinking wow this is so concisely written and the words are so carefully chosen

153
00:12:27.64 --> 00:12:33.96
And then I thought wait this is was this no wasn't written in English was written in German yet it's translated so well

154
00:12:33.96 --> 00:12:35.64
Yeah, the American one

155
00:12:35.64 --> 00:12:39.16
I'm gonna do that one probably next, but it's it's even more

156
00:12:39.64 --> 00:12:41.64
Like to the point

157
00:12:41.64 --> 00:12:42.44
So

158
00:12:42.44 --> 00:12:44.92
But you gotta know where you gotta know where connections come from

159
00:12:44.92 --> 00:12:51.72
I agree you gotta all back. Yeah, yeah, so continuing on armies as well as lesser units demand of leaders good

160
00:12:51.72 --> 00:12:58.52
Judgment here's what leaders need good judgment clear thinking and far seeing leaders with independence and decisive

161
00:12:58.76 --> 00:13:01.72
Resolution leaders with perseverance and energy

162
00:13:02.36 --> 00:13:06.44
Leaders not emotionally moved by the varying fortunes of war

163
00:13:07.16 --> 00:13:09.40
Leaders with a high sense of responsibility

164
00:13:09.40 --> 00:13:14.28
Yeah, it's not everything I talk about

165
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.56
They'll decentralize command here. Yeah decentralized command. Oh high sense of responsibility

166
00:13:19.56 --> 00:13:21.56
I think we might call that extreme ownership right

167
00:13:23.08 --> 00:13:25.08
Unemotionally moved

168
00:13:25.08 --> 00:13:28.20
Not emotionally moved by the varying fortunes of war detach

169
00:13:29.96 --> 00:13:33.32
So yeah, this this is just epic it's great

170
00:13:33.32 --> 00:13:43.64
The officer is a leader and a teacher besides his knowledge of men and his sense of justice must be distinguished by his superior knowledge and experience his earnest

171
00:13:45.48 --> 00:13:53.88
His earnestness his self control and high courage. I mean, yeah, this is just so awesome so legit

172
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.96
And it's funny because a lot of times people you know what's what you know they asked this question almost like a rhetorical question like

173
00:14:01.96 --> 00:14:06.12
But what is a leader you know, but what really is leader there you go yeah, we just just read it

174
00:14:06.52 --> 00:14:11.48
Yeah, so listen to that check those things in the mirror when you're trying to be a leader you know check and see

175
00:14:12.12 --> 00:14:13.72
If you're emotionally

176
00:14:13.72 --> 00:14:16.52
Detached check and see if you're earnest

177
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Boom earnest

178
00:14:21.32 --> 00:14:25.48
Check yourself control check your knowledge check your experience all those things

179
00:14:25.48 --> 00:14:33.56
Continue on the example and personal conduct of officers and non-commission officers are of decisive influence on the troops

180
00:14:35.08 --> 00:14:40.36
Wow the officer who in the face of the enemy is cold-blooded decisive and courageous

181
00:14:40.76 --> 00:14:48.68
Inspires his troops onward the officer must likewise find the way to the hearts of his subordinates and gain their trust through the an

182
00:14:48.68 --> 00:14:55.32
Understanding of their feelings and thoughts and through never ceasing care of their needs

183
00:14:56.36 --> 00:15:00.92
I mean relationships how much we talk on this right and it's this dichotomy

184
00:15:01.72 --> 00:15:02.76
I mean

185
00:15:02.76 --> 00:15:06.60
Detached emotionally, but not on emotion. You have to care and if you know the check here. I mean

186
00:15:07.48 --> 00:15:10.36
so ridiculous so ridiculously

187
00:15:11.72 --> 00:15:15.80
Incredible that I guess is not that ridiculous incredible. It's like oh

188
00:15:15.80 --> 00:15:19.08
You put a guy in

189
00:15:19.32 --> 00:15:24.84
2000 and whatever into a combat scenario when he's got a loot lead troops in a tough situation

190
00:15:26.12 --> 00:15:30.92
If they're successful at it, they're gonna come to the same conclusions that someone did in World War I

191
00:15:30.92 --> 00:15:37.48
Which is where this guy was coming this is 89.000 years ago that this was written right and well here's the thing people have been fundamentally the same for

192
00:15:38.20 --> 00:15:41.32
5000 years these are fundamentally true about human nature. Yes

193
00:15:41.32 --> 00:15:43.32
Yes

194
00:15:45.48 --> 00:15:48.36
But never ceasing to care for their needs

195
00:15:49.56 --> 00:15:51.08
When I had

196
00:15:51.08 --> 00:15:53.48
Mook mook on general mookyama

197
00:15:54.04 --> 00:15:57.72
He's the he's the guy that used that word Ross like

198
00:15:58.84 --> 00:16:03.88
Yes, he was one of hackwords company commanders and Vietnam and he was just

199
00:16:05.72 --> 00:16:09.000
You know, I was saying this and I was saying that he's like yeah, you got a care for your men

200
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
I don't like check and

201
00:16:12.20 --> 00:16:17.16
That's what he was talking about hackworth once again hackworth known as this you know badass hard-ass guy

202
00:16:18.04 --> 00:16:22.36
And he just hackworth cared about them more than anything. Yeah

203
00:16:26.52 --> 00:16:30.36
Mutual trust is the sureest basis of discipline

204
00:16:30.92 --> 00:16:32.92
In necessity and danger

205
00:16:32.92 --> 00:16:40.28
This is what I've been trying to explain to people for a couple years now is that is that the the word accountability

206
00:16:42.12 --> 00:16:43.32
I

207
00:16:43.32 --> 00:16:49.56
Only have to hold someone accountable if they don't have if we don't have that mutual trust where they understand where I'm coming from and they just go oh

208
00:16:49.72 --> 00:16:54.20
You want the weapons clean cool they'll be clean. I don't have to go and inspect the weapons right

209
00:16:54.92 --> 00:16:58.44
There's a mutual trust there and in that trust is discipline

210
00:16:58.44 --> 00:17:07.64
In all situations every leader must exert without a vision of a responsibility his whole personality

211
00:17:08.36 --> 00:17:14.52
willing and joyful acceptance of responsibility is the distinguishing characteristic of leadership

212
00:17:18.04 --> 00:17:23.48
This the speaking of plagiarism yeah, I just plagiarize this whole thing. I guess right. Yeah, well

213
00:17:23.48 --> 00:17:31.48
This does not mean that the subordinate should seek an arbitrary decision without proper consideration of the whole or that he should not obey

214
00:17:31.64 --> 00:17:36.68
Orders precisely or that he should let his feeling of the greater knowledge take precedence overall

215
00:17:36.76 --> 00:17:38.76
obedience

216
00:17:39.32 --> 00:17:41.48
Independence of action should never be based upon

217
00:17:41.64 --> 00:17:43.64
Contraryness

218
00:17:44.04 --> 00:17:47.88
Independence of action properly used is often the basis of great success

219
00:17:47.88 --> 00:17:56.04
So that's why you have to understand what the command is intent is because you got to be support when you make these decisions that you're making as a subordinate

220
00:17:56.28 --> 00:18:00.36
You got to make sure that they're in line that they're not contrary to what's going on

221
00:18:00.76 --> 00:18:05.08
But you know it just touched on something real briefly we were about this contrarian mindset

222
00:18:05.08 --> 00:18:12.76
There are there are people who just walk around with a contrarian mindset and it doesn't matter what gets said like they are always gonna be like well

223
00:18:13.08 --> 00:18:15.08
Yeah, but you know and

224
00:18:15.08 --> 00:18:20.52
Sometimes that other that outside thought is is a good angle to think about but you but he just said it

225
00:18:20.52 --> 00:18:24.56
He goes real quick. He just goes but you can't just be independent for the sake of being a

226
00:18:24.56 --> 00:18:26.56
Terrier or what a power. He just said that that

227
00:18:27.08 --> 00:18:33.08
Contrary in mindset which as you know, I mean I even open mind and I definitely try and think about things from a different angle

228
00:18:33.08 --> 00:18:38.36
But you're right people that are just being contrary because they just enjoy the friction right of

229
00:18:39.24 --> 00:18:43.16
Of arguing with people. Yeah, I'm not I'm not a big supporter of that

230
00:18:43.16 --> 00:18:47.32
And they end up having no influence because

231
00:18:48.84 --> 00:18:55.32
Because everybody just oh you you're if you they're crying wolf basically right everything they just disagree with every time

232
00:18:55.32 --> 00:18:57.32
So guess what yeah

233
00:18:59.40 --> 00:19:01.40
In spite of technique the worth of men

234
00:19:02.84 --> 00:19:04.84
Is the decisive factor

235
00:19:04.84 --> 00:19:13.48
It's significant is increased in group combat so the way they translate it in the American one. I think they say they value the

236
00:19:13.48 --> 00:19:17.68
I think they might even call it the combat value meaning basically are the dudes hard

237
00:19:18.24 --> 00:19:24.80
Like are the dudes hard that's what they're talking about here the worth the worth of men is the decisive factor

238
00:19:25.16 --> 00:19:29.20
This is an interesting translation here the emptiness of the battlefield demands

239
00:19:29.20 --> 00:19:35.68
Independently thinking and acting fighters who considering each situation are dominated by

240
00:19:36.24 --> 00:19:39.000
Conviction boldly and decisively to act and

241
00:19:39.76 --> 00:19:41.76
Determined to arrive at success

242
00:19:41.76 --> 00:19:44.32
So the emptiness of the battlefield in the American translation

243
00:19:44.68 --> 00:19:48.08
They talk about because modern warfare

244
00:19:48.80 --> 00:19:52.64
Demands that we be separate from each other like as you and I know

245
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.92
If you and I are in patrol we're not close to each other. You know, we're dispersed and we're gonna spread out

246
00:19:57.92 --> 00:20:02.56
So that we're not gonna get killed by one machine gun round or one more to round

247
00:20:02.80 --> 00:20:06.000
So because of that distance that's what they're talking about when he talks about the emptiness

248
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.44
So because of that emptiness on the battlefield you have to have independent think independently thinking and acting fighters

249
00:20:12.08 --> 00:20:17.36
Right because I'm not gonna be there to tell you what to do you're not gonna be there to tell you guys what to do

250
00:20:17.44 --> 00:20:22.80
They're gonna have to independently act. That's the way it's got to be that's something that we call decentralized

251
00:20:22.80 --> 00:20:28.68
Experiment being accustomed to physical accomplishments lack of consideration of self

252
00:20:29.40 --> 00:20:35.84
Will power self confidence and courage qualify a man to master the most difficult situations. There you go

253
00:20:37.28 --> 00:20:43.04
There you go. Let's work on that physical accomplishments. What does that mean? Do athletic things?

254
00:20:43.04 --> 00:20:46.76
You have to be in shape lack of consideration of self boom

255
00:20:47.28 --> 00:20:50.40
You're not important will power. Yes

256
00:20:50.40 --> 00:20:57.36
Discipline self confidence and courage qualified man to master the most difficult situations

257
00:20:59.20 --> 00:21:04.56
The worth of leaders in men determined the battle worth of the troops

258
00:21:05.36 --> 00:21:09.36
Which is supplemented by the possession care and maintenance of arms and equipment

259
00:21:10.08 --> 00:21:14.48
Superior battle worth can equalize numerical inferiority

260
00:21:14.48 --> 00:21:22.24
So if you're just hard core fighters it doesn't matter right how many people the enemies got because we're gonna get

261
00:21:22.24 --> 00:21:24.24
self

262
00:21:24.24 --> 00:21:27.92
The higher the battle worth the more vigorous and versatile

263
00:21:28.48 --> 00:21:30.48
can war be executed

264
00:21:31.60 --> 00:21:33.60
Superior leadership

265
00:21:33.60 --> 00:21:34.40
and

266
00:21:34.40 --> 00:21:38.72
Superior troop battle readiness are reliable portence of victory

267
00:21:38.72 --> 00:21:46.96
The leaders must live with their troops participate in their dangers their wants their joys their sorrows

268
00:21:47.36 --> 00:21:52.24
Only in this way can they estimate the battle worth and the requirements of the troops

269
00:21:53.28 --> 00:21:55.28
Sitting around in the ivy tower

270
00:21:55.68 --> 00:22:00.48
That's interesting though because we do have a thing in this military about the separation to a certain degree

271
00:22:00.48 --> 00:22:06.48
Right this is saying and so there's gonna be a bounce there too right. I mean, yeah, but you can't be in the ivory tower and totally

272
00:22:06.48 --> 00:22:08.48
Disassociate people like who's that guy?

273
00:22:08.48 --> 00:22:11.68
No, I just get orders for that guy battle field the loophoness

274
00:22:12.32 --> 00:22:15.44
You know you gotta actually get out of the hum v

275
00:22:16.16 --> 00:22:20.40
And go see what's going on. That's what you got it. Yeah. Yeah. Nope. Yeah

276
00:22:21.84 --> 00:22:25.60
Man is not responsible for himself alone

277
00:22:26.40 --> 00:22:28.40
But also for his comrades

278
00:22:30.40 --> 00:22:36.000
He you can do more who has greater capacity of accomplishment must instruct the inexperienced and weaker

279
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:45.60
From such conduct the feeling of real comradeship develops which is just as important between the leaders and the men as between the men themselves

280
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.96
troops only superficially and not through long training and experience well together

281
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.16
More easily fail under severe conditions and unexpected crisis

282
00:23:00.16 --> 00:23:05.52
So if you're only superficially and you haven't gone through long training and you haven't been well together

283
00:23:06.08 --> 00:23:10.72
When the hard times come you ain't gonna make it and that's really when people ask me about

284
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.96
You know, how do you build the team and how do you develop the bonds and team you do hard stuff together?

285
00:23:16.96 --> 00:23:21.04
That's right. You do hard stuff and when we work with companies now companies that made it through

286
00:23:21.84 --> 00:23:23.84
the downturn of

287
00:23:24.16 --> 00:23:28.16
2007 2008 because most a lot of companies didn't make it but the companies that there was

288
00:23:28.16 --> 00:23:32.88
Refer back to those experiences like you know, that's what bonded them together right

289
00:23:33.84 --> 00:23:39.04
Same thing with the military. You know you go through boot camp. What is that? It's a hard experience. You bond with all these people

290
00:23:39.04 --> 00:23:41.84
And you know when you meet someone else in the military they went through an atominum

291
00:23:41.84 --> 00:23:47.44
And they went through boot camp or Officer Canada at school or whatever some sort of hard kind of indoctrination

292
00:23:48.64 --> 00:23:50.64
Then you go to airborne school

293
00:23:51.20 --> 00:23:54.56
Thing where you're all gonna overcome your fears of jumping out of airplanes or whatever

294
00:23:54.56 --> 00:24:00.72
Then you go to some kind of special operation school same thing you're just you're just putting people through harder and harder

295
00:24:00.72 --> 00:24:04.56
Things to get them tighter and tighter and more more bonded together

296
00:24:05.20 --> 00:24:08.64
So they can overcome these adversities when they come their way

297
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.60
Therefore

298
00:24:11.60 --> 00:24:20.08
Before the outbreak of war the development and maintenance of steadiness and discipline in the troops as well as their training is of decisive importance

299
00:24:20.08 --> 00:24:29.68
Every commander is enjoying immediately to intervene with all powers that is disposal against any relaxation of discipline

300
00:24:30.24 --> 00:24:35.68
Against excesses plundering panic and other damaging influence

301
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.24
Gotta get the game if you that stuff going on

302
00:24:40.24 --> 00:24:50.40
Mm-hmm discipline is fundamental in an army it's strict maintenance a benefit to all

303
00:24:53.28 --> 00:24:55.28
No big deal just discipline

304
00:24:56.40 --> 00:24:59.92
So so it's interesting it's touched on a few things here which I think you know

305
00:25:00.80 --> 00:25:04.96
We get that because it's military mixed total sense and and it

306
00:25:05.52 --> 00:25:09.60
Talk about it when you want but there's you know people I think struggle with how do you do that in business today?

307
00:25:09.60 --> 00:25:15.04
Well, you know HR and how do I can possibly you have to still find a way to do that appropriately because

308
00:25:16.24 --> 00:25:19.44
HR doesn't have anything to do with having discipline process procedure

309
00:25:19.60 --> 00:25:24.56
You know no, no, I'm talking about getting in and knowing what's going on with your people and in their life and

310
00:25:25.12 --> 00:25:29.68
And doing hard things together, you know because I think what people call you got to show up on time do this part of your job

311
00:25:29.68 --> 00:25:32.88
And so how do you how do you actually deepen those bonds in a company?

312
00:25:33.28 --> 00:25:37.84
You got to find ways to put people through difficult things together through training

313
00:25:37.84 --> 00:25:44.32
Find events to do that builds that camaraderie that gets them through a hard time that strengthens the bonds of those relationships

314
00:25:44.32 --> 00:25:49.76
I see good companies good leaders do it in companies where they just set really tough goals that are

315
00:25:50.56 --> 00:25:55.44
Very hard but achievable whether it's a production goal whether it's a sales goal whether it's

316
00:25:56.40 --> 00:26:03.52
Project goal and people have to really turn and burn to get it done. Yeah, and when they get it done

317
00:26:03.52 --> 00:26:10.32
They have to force to work hard together. They're first to go to the extreme a little bit to work extra hours to

318
00:26:10.88 --> 00:26:16.16
Figure things out to strengthen their relationships and when they get done to everyone you know, and it's stressful

319
00:26:16.96 --> 00:26:19.84
And then they get done and everyone's kind of holding their head up a little bit higher

320
00:26:19.84 --> 00:26:24.24
It's right a little bit tighter. So it's not even it doesn't even necessarily have to be that you have to

321
00:26:24.56 --> 00:26:30.32
Allocate separate training to do this. You go hey guys here's this project. It's doing 30 days

322
00:26:30.32 --> 00:26:35.84
We're gonna deliver it in 24 days. I ran the numbers. I looked at the schedule

323
00:26:36.40 --> 00:26:42.80
We can do it who's in and everyone goes yeah, we're in and then everyone buckles down and they overcame

324
00:26:42.80 --> 00:26:46.64
They achieve something that's what they do so that's what that's how you

325
00:26:47.36 --> 00:26:54.80
That's how you bring that build that bond between people and strengthen teams by doing hard stuff set goals on normal things

326
00:26:55.44 --> 00:26:57.44
Because think about it when I come in and go

327
00:26:57.44 --> 00:27:00.48
Hey guys, we got this project do it's doing 30 days

328
00:27:01.12 --> 00:27:02.88
Could take a little bit longer though. I don't know

329
00:27:03.44 --> 00:27:09.60
Everyone know who gets fired up to hear that right? No one no one who goes. Oh cool. I'm gonna take an extra

330
00:27:09.92 --> 00:27:14.80
Half hour for lunch every day if that's that's no people don't even want to do that

331
00:27:14.96 --> 00:27:19.28
Like people might think they want to do that people might think they want to do that, but they don't want to do that

332
00:27:19.28 --> 00:27:20.96
No, they don't want to do that

333
00:27:20.96 --> 00:27:27.68
They don't want to do that they want to get after it and that's our job as leaders is to set that bar and to set it even a little bit higher

334
00:27:27.68 --> 00:27:33.12
And then and then inspire and encourage and bring everybody along to try and get to that next level further than what they've

335
00:27:33.12 --> 00:27:38.16
Wait wait oh 24 days. Yeah, all right. Okay, boss. What am I going to do? Yeah, what am I going to do? Just here

336
00:27:38.16 --> 00:27:40.72
Wait a second. You really think this is possible. Yes, I do. Yeah, I do

337
00:27:40.96 --> 00:27:42.96
I do know what we're gonna make the whole world

338
00:27:42.96 --> 00:27:47.28
We're gonna make everyone at this company look at us and say dang they did that in 24 days

339
00:27:47.28 --> 00:27:52.80
I guess what some other teams is gonna do. I know we can do it 23. That's right. I think we think yeah, I know

340
00:27:53.36 --> 00:27:59.28
I know we get some good competition going so that's awesome. That's what you have to do that's how you build teams

341
00:28:00.08 --> 00:28:06.56
Stress build teams now if you have a team that's slightly fractured guess what that stress will do break it apart

342
00:28:06.56 --> 00:28:11.60
Yeah, it's gonna find those weak. Yes, right so there's a balance. Oh, there's also a balance between

343
00:28:11.60 --> 00:28:16.56
Hey, you can set goals. Hey, there's a project that's doing 30 days. We're gonna do it in 15

344
00:28:17.20 --> 00:28:21.76
It's unrealistic everyone just looks at it goes yeah, Jochka's an idiot. You understand understood he's in the ivory tower

345
00:28:21.76 --> 00:28:26.24
doesn't even know what it takes to get this done so balance balance there 100%

346
00:28:28.56 --> 00:28:35.28
Continuing along back to the book the strength of the troops must be able to meet the highest demands in decisive moments

347
00:28:35.28 --> 00:28:41.92
He who unnecessarily fatigues the troops jeopardizes success. Oh, oh, there you go

348
00:28:44.24 --> 00:28:47.92
The strength employed in battle must stand in proportion to the objective desired

349
00:28:48.56 --> 00:28:56.000
Unreliable demands prejudice the trust in the leaders and shake the spirit of the troops again. This is a cry wolf situation

350
00:28:56.16 --> 00:28:58.16
We got to get this done in 15 days

351
00:28:58.64 --> 00:29:03.76
It's like and that's my you know the first time everyone goes okay, and then maybe we get it done in 15 days

352
00:29:03.76 --> 00:29:06.96
And then people look up what what we're doing for the next 15 days. We're gonna

353
00:29:06.96 --> 00:29:12.40
I'm gonna do more you know and you eventually just burn everyone out right so there's a balance that

354
00:29:14.40 --> 00:29:16.40
Back to the book from the youngest soldier

355
00:29:18.16 --> 00:29:24.08
On up the employment of every spiritual and bodily power is demanded to the utmost

356
00:29:24.16 --> 00:29:28.72
Only in such conduct is the full power of accomplishments of the troops

357
00:29:28.72 --> 00:29:37.28
Achieved so do men develop and maintain their courage and powers of decision in hours of stress and carry forward with them

358
00:29:38.08 --> 00:29:41.52
To greater deeds their weaker comrades

359
00:29:41.52 --> 00:29:48.56
So you can actually pass on your strength to the people around you in moments of stress. Absolutely if you're strong

360
00:29:50.24 --> 00:29:53.52
Does that you know like when people quit in Buds?

361
00:29:54.88 --> 00:29:57.60
I got I like took their

362
00:29:57.60 --> 00:30:03.20
Power it's so hard to say that man. I can't I was literally about some people

363
00:30:03.20 --> 00:30:06.000
Some people go the other way right some people they see someone quit and they're like oh

364
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.76
Dude if he's quit, no I'm quitting that's right. I can't even relate. Yeah, I mean I mean I thought I saw it happen

365
00:30:12.40 --> 00:30:15.04
And not from some dude. I'm not like some big you know

366
00:30:15.60 --> 00:30:20.000
There's not from to some ecotistical perspective. I say I can't really I just I'm not wired like that I

367
00:30:20.72 --> 00:30:23.36
I'm wired like call a corny, but you know high-landered like

368
00:30:23.36 --> 00:30:28.96
You know how you would absorb like the strength of like that's kind of kind of like but like

369
00:30:29.52 --> 00:30:35.68
You know when a guy would quit I have somehow I felt like I absorbed his what was left of his power and it actually

370
00:30:35.68 --> 00:30:41.44
It more like it inspired me it's it inspired me to keep going the fact that I could keep going and that guy couldn't

371
00:30:41.84 --> 00:30:43.84
It just I was like okay, you know, I mean

372
00:30:44.64 --> 00:30:48.08
It gave me more purpose. Yeah, that's why

373
00:30:49.04 --> 00:30:51.04
You just got to stay hard man

374
00:30:51.04 --> 00:30:53.04
You know

375
00:30:53.04 --> 00:30:58.80
People are starting to because you're you're if other people start to see you like cracking and

376
00:30:59.44 --> 00:31:02.96
There are your troops. They're gonna be like oh no, right? This is a bad sign

377
00:31:03.52 --> 00:31:06.48
Yeah, because jocos breaking down. This is not good

378
00:31:07.84 --> 00:31:11.92
Yeah, because we also are like well that will never happen if we jocos so jocco don't ever get

379
00:31:12.72 --> 00:31:14.72
Now don't worry

380
00:31:14.72 --> 00:31:18.40
If you took a knee we wouldn't we wouldn't let you or we would just step in for you. Yeah

381
00:31:18.40 --> 00:31:21.76
But I don't see that happening not happening

382
00:31:22.80 --> 00:31:28.000
Here this is what you I was actually gonna jump right here because when we started this thing off you you talked about this a little bit

383
00:31:28.24 --> 00:31:30.88
The first demand in war is decisive action

384
00:31:31.60 --> 00:31:34.72
So like you were saying like hey you can be the smartest person with a great plan

385
00:31:34.72 --> 00:31:36.88
But if you can't do it if you can't act on it

386
00:31:37.20 --> 00:31:42.96
Everyone the highest commander and most junior soldier must be aware that omissions and

387
00:31:42.96 --> 00:31:49.52
And neglects incriminate him more severely than the mistake of choice

388
00:31:51.04 --> 00:31:55.04
So if you decide not to act you are a worse

389
00:31:55.52 --> 00:32:00.72
Criminal yeah in the world I agree then someone that just makes a bad decision bad judgment

390
00:32:00.72 --> 00:32:08.72
But moves I just disappeared for second back to Ramadi and and thought of those exact that exactly happening like in real life like

391
00:32:08.72 --> 00:32:16.08
Like in those moments when there is things going on you act and you can maneuver in

392
00:32:16.64 --> 00:32:21.68
Aggressively solve a problem even if you make a small mistake. It's it's the default aggressive

393
00:32:21.68 --> 00:32:25.92
Yes, right. It's the complacency while I sit back and our dick kind of went away

394
00:32:25.92 --> 00:32:29.76
I wish that no, I just steamed all this you got to make a call now

395
00:32:30.64 --> 00:32:32.000
Obviously

396
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.16
Having to point this stuff all the time, but it's the truth

397
00:32:34.16 --> 00:32:38.96
If you just jump and make rash decisions without thinking about them that's also stupid

398
00:32:38.96 --> 00:32:43.44
You have to let things develop but this idea of in action

399
00:32:43.44 --> 00:32:47.20
I mean it is the worst that's why what are what are people say about

400
00:32:47.92 --> 00:32:51.76
Inaction is a decision so like no decision is the bad decision right?

401
00:32:52.32 --> 00:32:57.20
No decision is the worst decision no decision is a decision first of all yeah no decision is a decision

402
00:32:57.92 --> 00:32:59.12
And

403
00:32:59.12 --> 00:33:03.20
It might be the worst decision sometimes no decision while I watch things develop

404
00:33:03.20 --> 00:33:06.56
You might be the right call but let's be clear no decision is a decision

405
00:33:07.20 --> 00:33:08.80
What I've been trying to teach people lately

406
00:33:09.92 --> 00:33:12.80
Is like a standard operating procedure for when you don't know what to do

407
00:33:13.28 --> 00:33:16.64
Here's the standard operating procedure for when you don't know what to do you

408
00:33:17.60 --> 00:33:21.52
Look at what the situation where you take you did that you take a step back you look at what's unfolding

409
00:33:22.16 --> 00:33:24.16
Then you make the smallest

410
00:33:25.12 --> 00:33:28.88
Decision in the area that you guess is the right direction to move

411
00:33:28.88 --> 00:33:36.24
And then you assess what that did so you don't just jump off and flank left because you thought that was the right call

412
00:33:36.24 --> 00:33:37.52
No you go okay

413
00:33:37.52 --> 00:33:42.16
Hey guys start pushing left okay, so they start moving a little bit. Do they meet major resistance?

414
00:33:42.72 --> 00:33:44.72
No, okay cool continue with a flank

415
00:33:45.04 --> 00:33:48.88
You don't just go flank left now they run over there now they're getting flanked and it's a bad situation

416
00:33:49.20 --> 00:33:50.40
So

417
00:33:50.40 --> 00:33:52.64
That's the thing you you make a small decision

418
00:33:53.28 --> 00:33:56.88
The smallest possible decision that you can but you make a decision

419
00:33:56.88 --> 00:34:00.32
You start moving in the direction that you think is correct assess yes

420
00:34:01.60 --> 00:34:03.04
Move yes

421
00:34:03.04 --> 00:34:04.16
assess

422
00:34:04.16 --> 00:34:06.96
Yeah, you get an in-loop is what you're gonna do. You're gonna end up in a little in-loop

423
00:34:07.28 --> 00:34:09.68
But people get afraid of making a big decision

424
00:34:10.88 --> 00:34:14.96
Now sometimes you have to make a big ball decision of course, but people get afraid of

425
00:34:15.84 --> 00:34:21.84
Making that they can't see they only want to go 100% in right they don't see that they can go 8%

426
00:34:22.40 --> 00:34:24.40
Yeah, so 8% in

427
00:34:24.40 --> 00:34:29.20
Is that the last muster so I think it was at the last muster someone asked me something about this

428
00:34:29.20 --> 00:34:32.56
But you know when you say hey we want to go explore this new market area

429
00:34:33.12 --> 00:34:39.60
Let's let's buy three buildings in that market area and see where it happens. No

430
00:34:39.60 --> 00:34:42.40
That's not what you do first do market research

431
00:34:42.40 --> 00:34:46.40
Then maybe you put a couple key asks up on the street corner and see there's any interest

432
00:34:46.40 --> 00:34:48.40
I'll leave some space

433
00:34:48.40 --> 00:34:50.40
You know like that's what you do

434
00:34:50.40 --> 00:34:57.60
That's the kind of mentality you can have you don't need to just be paralyzed by the fact that it's this giant you break it down into some smaller decisions

435
00:34:57.60 --> 00:35:03.04
It would have decision making is what I call it and to be clear this is in the I don't know what to do right now

436
00:35:03.04 --> 00:35:06.000
I'm in an unknown position right I mean because

437
00:35:06.72 --> 00:35:12.72
You know we're not talking about sheepishly going in directions here. We're talking about no no what to do here

438
00:35:13.44 --> 00:35:14.96
So I will

439
00:35:14.96 --> 00:35:19.20
Go in the direction that I believe to be the best, but I'm gonna take a small decision as I can

440
00:35:19.20 --> 00:35:22.40
I don't want to take too much ground in the right could it could be the wrong direction

441
00:35:22.40 --> 00:35:25.04
It would be the wrong direction. I'm gonna go the direction that I think is right

442
00:35:26.24 --> 00:35:34.16
But in the smallest of a decision that I can make in that direction and then I'm gonna reassess yes and guess what if it's the wrong decision

443
00:35:34.32 --> 00:35:39.36
Now you know that if it's the wrong direction you just you hit a wall there now you just figured that out

444
00:35:39.36 --> 00:35:42.96
Where when you made no decision you still you don't you still know which way to go that's right

445
00:35:42.96 --> 00:35:49.12
360 degrees so when I say hey we're gonna go 90 degrees cool we take a step and we realize there's mass of resistance

446
00:35:49.12 --> 00:35:54.32
They're cool we're gonna go 180 degrees oh okay right on you know it's you know it's a you know

447
00:35:54.32 --> 00:36:00.56
It's a really good like modern day example of that you're even sitting like using your map like like Google maps or whatever

448
00:36:00.56 --> 00:36:04.64
And if you're not moving in a direction it sometimes doesn't know which direction you're going in

449
00:36:04.64 --> 00:36:06.08
Oh, so arrow just kind of

450
00:36:06.08 --> 00:36:09.12
It's like a step out of a hotel. I'm like

451
00:36:09.44 --> 00:36:12.40
Which one must supposed to go here dang it the thing is doesn't even know which one so

452
00:36:12.40 --> 00:36:15.76
All right, you know I think it's that direction is where it's supposed to go so I start walking

453
00:36:15.76 --> 00:36:20.32
Yeah, as soon as I take 10 steps the map the arrow or ants itself and it's like yeah, you're going the right way

454
00:36:20.32 --> 00:36:22.64
Sometimes I don't ask you oh you know you went the wrong way

455
00:36:22.64 --> 00:36:24.72
It is like oh okay cool I'll turn around and go back together

456
00:36:24.72 --> 00:36:29.52
Or you could have stood there in the door of the hotel blocking the blocking the traffic and

457
00:36:29.76 --> 00:36:36.32
Staring at that compass rotate and it's not going anywhere that is exactly what happens and so that's why you you make a small decision

458
00:36:36.32 --> 00:36:39.32
You didn't you didn't hail a cab and get it

459
00:36:39.32 --> 00:36:45.08
Start driving that way sprinting down the road. It's 10 steps. Yeah, that's the way it works

460
00:36:47.08 --> 00:36:48.04
All right

461
00:36:48.04 --> 00:36:54.76
Can to in by the way I always have to say this why I'm not covering this whole book this book is online PDF

462
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
You can download it. It's free

463
00:36:57.40 --> 00:36:58.68
I'm not reading the whole thing

464
00:36:58.68 --> 00:37:01.24
There's a bunch of like granularly

465
00:37:01.48 --> 00:37:08.92
Tactical things inside that were not going to cover but we're covering the big stuff the stuff that's applicable to every

466
00:37:08.92 --> 00:37:14.04
Thing that we do next section section two it's a second call leadership

467
00:37:15.48 --> 00:37:19.72
So here we go great successes presumed boldness and daring

468
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Proceeded by good judgment

469
00:37:24.04 --> 00:37:30.20
Check we never have at our disposal all the desire forces for decisive action

470
00:37:31.48 --> 00:37:35.08
The news flash you're not going to have everything you want all the time. It's not happening

471
00:37:35.08 --> 00:37:43.000
He who will be secure everywhere or who fixes forces in secondary tasks

472
00:37:43.48 --> 00:37:46.20
Acts contrary to the fundamental task

473
00:37:48.28 --> 00:37:53.000
So if you're a trying to do too many things at the same time we call that prioritize next

474
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.96
You if you got a button if you're trying to do all these secondary tasks you're not focusing on the main one you're gonna get crushed

475
00:37:59.40 --> 00:38:01.40
and if you're so

476
00:38:01.88 --> 00:38:03.88
dang

477
00:38:03.88 --> 00:38:05.88
Rooted in your situation

478
00:38:06.84 --> 00:38:08.84
If you're secure everywhere

479
00:38:09.80 --> 00:38:13.64
If you're secure everywhere you're not gonna make any progress

480
00:38:14.12 --> 00:38:15.56
Yeah, man, that's

481
00:38:15.56 --> 00:38:21.000
Hunker down. Yeah, I'm secure. I'm safe hunker down when you're hunkering down the enemies maneuvering

482
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
That's what's happening

483
00:38:23.56 --> 00:38:28.12
The weaker force through speed mobility great march accomplishments

484
00:38:28.60 --> 00:38:33.000
Utilization of darkness and the terrain to the fullest surprise and deception

485
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.04
Can be the stronger at the decisive area. So boom that's jujitsu by the way

486
00:38:39.48 --> 00:38:43.32
And special forces and everything we do to leverage our numerically

487
00:38:44.04 --> 00:38:46.04
smaller force. Yeah

488
00:38:46.60 --> 00:38:48.92
Time and space must be correctly estimated

489
00:38:49.16 --> 00:38:55.88
Favorable situations quickly recognized and decisively exploited every advantage over the enemy

490
00:38:56.04 --> 00:38:59.16
Increases our own freedom of action. And yeah

491
00:38:59.16 --> 00:39:04.04
That's not just special forces not just special operations. It's every

492
00:39:04.68 --> 00:39:06.36
Mediterranean. They all do this

493
00:39:07.56 --> 00:39:09.16
If they're good

494
00:39:09.16 --> 00:39:16.04
Repidity of action in the displacement of troops can be greatly can be assisted greatly or retarded by the roads and streets

495
00:39:18.36 --> 00:39:21.72
Nets and by the terrain conditions

496
00:39:24.36 --> 00:39:27.72
The season the weather the condition of the troops are also of influence

497
00:39:27.72 --> 00:39:32.28
The duration of strategic and tactical operations

498
00:39:32.28 --> 00:39:35.48
Cannot always be first seen you don't know how long something's going to last

499
00:39:35.88 --> 00:39:42.04
Successful engagements often precedes slowly often the success of today's battle is first recognized tomorrow

500
00:39:42.28 --> 00:39:44.28
It's an interesting one

501
00:39:44.92 --> 00:39:55.16
Surprise of the enemy is a decisive factor in success actions based on surprises are only of great success when we do not permit the enemy to take adequate countermeasures

502
00:39:55.16 --> 00:39:57.16
So

503
00:39:57.16 --> 00:39:59.24
You can you got to follow up. That's where you got to follow up

504
00:40:00.20 --> 00:40:02.20
That's why in

505
00:40:02.44 --> 00:40:10.84
Striking you got to throw combination you can't just throw one punch you got to stinging them with the jab and then you got to hand them with the straight and then you got to get coming with the hook

506
00:40:11.72 --> 00:40:13.72
That's what you got to do you know it's interesting the

507
00:40:15.08 --> 00:40:17.08
Don't want about

508
00:40:17.08 --> 00:40:20.36
Often this success of today's battle is first recognized tomorrow

509
00:40:20.36 --> 00:40:26.20
What's interesting about that one I don't know if you remember this because I don't know you might not have been

510
00:40:26.60 --> 00:40:32.52
I might not have engaged you at this level, but when we first started doing sniper overwatches and Ramadi and

511
00:40:33.72 --> 00:40:36.60
I was getting some questions from off the chain of command

512
00:40:37.40 --> 00:40:41.000
They were hey look what you know this is after a couple weeks

513
00:40:41.56 --> 00:40:47.08
It was hey you know we get that you're killing some people, but there's no metrics like there's the

514
00:40:47.08 --> 00:40:52.52
You've said you shot three iED in places iEDs have not gone down

515
00:40:53.32 --> 00:40:55.80
Like the and iED places have not gone down and

516
00:40:57.24 --> 00:41:02.76
Luckily I had read the the one oh the one is it the one tech 24 the counter insurgency manual

517
00:41:03.32 --> 00:41:07.16
And I had learned from that manual that the average counter insurgency takes seven years

518
00:41:07.16 --> 00:41:11.16
So I replied back to the chain of command and said hey just kind of FYI

519
00:41:11.72 --> 00:41:13.72
We're fighting a counter insurgency

520
00:41:13.72 --> 00:41:16.60
The average counter insurgency takes

521
00:41:17.40 --> 00:41:20.84
takes seven years to achieve victory

522
00:41:21.24 --> 00:41:26.76
We've been doing this for two and a half weeks. Can I get a little more time to see some metrics on it?

523
00:41:26.76 --> 00:41:30.44
So and that's true and actually Colonel McFarlin

524
00:41:31.40 --> 00:41:34.04
This was a battle that he had to fight because

525
00:41:35.32 --> 00:41:40.92
Here you are you know it's a metrics based people that are looking at things from a metrics based level right

526
00:41:40.92 --> 00:41:46.76
They're saying okay in Ramadi there's 30 enemy attacks a day and all of a sudden

527
00:41:47.40 --> 00:41:51.96
McFarlin rolls in and starts this counter insurgency and the enemy attacks

528
00:41:52.44 --> 00:41:57.24
Go up or yeah and they go up a lot and so his chain of commands look at that

529
00:41:57.24 --> 00:42:01.96
What are you doing right what are you doing the enemy attacks are gonna be worse your things not working and he has to explain to them

530
00:42:02.28 --> 00:42:06.60
You know why the enemy attacks are going up because we are actually taking ground from them and they're fighting

531
00:42:06.84 --> 00:42:09.16
Yeah, and we're killing them, but this is what's gonna happen

532
00:42:09.16 --> 00:42:15.96
So the initial metrics are the reverse of what you want and that's the way it is that's what so these

533
00:42:16.52 --> 00:42:20.12
The success of the success of a battle is not always visible today

534
00:42:20.44 --> 00:42:25.96
You have to look at the long-term effects. Well, we went into the Hornets nest. I mean, it's like hey, you know

535
00:42:25.96 --> 00:42:29.40
What my kid gets stung by this be like you know once a year

536
00:42:29.56 --> 00:42:34.20
Well, we're gonna go in and get rid of the bees nest all right. Well, we go in there. We got you guys got stung like 20 times

537
00:42:34.20 --> 00:42:40.60
Yeah, because we went in and we actually are destroying the Hornets nest so they're stinging us now even more. That's why it went up and when we're done

538
00:42:40.60 --> 00:42:45.16
Though they're not gonna sting us at all, but for now the numbers went up. That's exactly what happened. What do you want to know like that?

539
00:42:46.36 --> 00:42:51.64
We used to go after the Hornets nest. It's a sort of a test of uh, you know when you're eight years old

540
00:42:51.64 --> 00:42:53.88
It was it's always a test of of

541
00:42:55.32 --> 00:42:59.08
Of courage basically because you're gonna go in there with a stick

542
00:42:59.08 --> 00:43:04.68
Like that they have to see if you can get it to fall down and you know, it's like playing Pinata

543
00:43:04.68 --> 00:43:09.96
You don't get it on the first shot. It can take some viewers so you whack it and then you run and those things come after you

544
00:43:11.40 --> 00:43:19.000
Right, but then so all of a sudden this things go on and me attacks go up. Yeah, you get in stung like when you go in and hit a Hornets nest with a with a stick

545
00:43:19.24 --> 00:43:21.24
You're getting stung

546
00:43:21.48 --> 00:43:23.48
Pretty much that's what's gonna happen

547
00:43:23.48 --> 00:43:31.48
All right, back to the book the enemy will likewise endeavor to make use of surprise our conduct must take this in a

548
00:43:31.48 --> 00:43:38.76
Consideration the knowledge of hostile leadership and war principles can influence the decision and aid our battle conduct

549
00:43:39.16 --> 00:43:45.08
But it must never lead to preconceptions. Oh, that's good, isn't it like we know what the enemy's gonna do

550
00:43:45.08 --> 00:43:50.52
But we know really know what that's right. Hey, they're gonna use the laws of combat, but we got a

551
00:43:50.52 --> 00:43:55.40
Remember that they might they might step outside the bounds of the laws of combat

552
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.88
Those conditions which facilitate the conduct of war in our land make it difficult make it more difficult in foreign lands

553
00:44:04.36 --> 00:44:09.16
Require consideration. Yeah, it's much easier on your own grant. We've learned that over and over again

554
00:44:11.88 --> 00:44:16.60
In strany us combat troops are soon worn out and quickly used up

555
00:44:16.60 --> 00:44:24.92
The forces must receive timely reinforcements in leaders men animals battle needs and

556
00:44:25.48 --> 00:44:27.48
War materials of all kinds

557
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:38.44
Boys are gonna get worn out after a while the mission and the situation form the basis of action

558
00:44:39.40 --> 00:44:45.08
The mission and the situation form the basis of action the mission designates the objective to be a chain to be attained

559
00:44:45.08 --> 00:44:51.08
The leader must never forget his mission a mission which indicates several tasks easily

560
00:44:51.24 --> 00:44:54.84
Deverts from the main exit objective so once again prioritize next year

561
00:44:54.84 --> 00:44:58.52
If you've got a bunch of different things you're not gonna achieve the main objective

562
00:45:01.64 --> 00:45:03.64
At a situation recently

563
00:45:04.20 --> 00:45:11.16
Where people were wearing some of their teammates out and was talking to this company about how to do this and

564
00:45:11.16 --> 00:45:19.32
I said the mission is number one that's our mission mission is number one, but the mission requires people and so you have to take care of your people

565
00:45:19.32 --> 00:45:24.84
And you have to balance their you know how how tired they are whether they're being replenished

566
00:45:25.64 --> 00:45:28.76
But again always in balance, but the mission is number one

567
00:45:28.92 --> 00:45:32.84
But it takes the people and the team to accomplish the mission. So if you wear your team out

568
00:45:33.16 --> 00:45:38.36
Then you got nobody left even accomplish the mission. That's so that's the dichotomy you talk about that in the dichotomy leadership

569
00:45:38.36 --> 00:45:40.36
I mean if you if

570
00:45:40.36 --> 00:45:47.08
If all your focus on is the mission your men will be either used up destroyed. They won't trust you anymore. It'll be a disaster

571
00:45:47.72 --> 00:45:49.72
so your men

572
00:45:50.04 --> 00:45:52.68
your people have to come first

573
00:45:54.12 --> 00:45:59.72
And at the same time the dichotomy is if you do nothing but care about your people then guess what

574
00:46:00.28 --> 00:46:03.96
You won't have anyone you you want to accomplish the mission which by the way

575
00:46:03.96 --> 00:46:12.52
Hurts your people because if you're in the business world and you're trying to push your people to drive production or or do their job at a faster pace

576
00:46:13.32 --> 00:46:14.68
Great

577
00:46:14.68 --> 00:46:18.92
Then you burn them out and they leave and also in the company folds or the opposite okay guys

578
00:46:19.08 --> 00:46:24.44
You know take your time. We guess what now we don't get anything done and the company folds so what you have to do is you have to balance

579
00:46:28.76 --> 00:46:30.76
obscurity of the situation is the rule

580
00:46:30.76 --> 00:46:32.76
Rule

581
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.80
Seldom will one have exact information of the enemy clarification of hostile situation is is a self evident demand

582
00:46:40.12 --> 00:46:46.92
However to wait intense set intense situations for information is seldom a token of strong leadership

583
00:46:47.40 --> 00:46:51.40
Often of weakness so look you're not gonna know everything. It's not gonna happen

584
00:46:51.96 --> 00:46:56.44
You have to make decisions that's what you got to do otherwise sign a weakness

585
00:46:56.44 --> 00:47:11.72
They edited me on billions oh yes, they they there was one little section where I was in the show billions and there was one little sections where where they showed

586
00:47:12.92 --> 00:47:14.28
Dollar bill

587
00:47:14.28 --> 00:47:19.000
Getting like a massage or something like that and I was looking at him when I just go weak

588
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.04
But I did make the cut

589
00:47:28.92 --> 00:47:35.24
Next the decision arises from the mission and the situation the decision arises from the mission and the situation

590
00:47:35.56 --> 00:47:41.88
Should the mission no longer suffice as the fundamental of conduct or if it is changed by events the decisions

591
00:47:42.20 --> 00:47:45.000
The decision must take these considerations into account

592
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:52.84
He who changes his mission or does not execute the one given must report his actions at once and assume all

593
00:47:53.08 --> 00:47:57.80
Responsibility for the consequences he must always keep in mind the whole situation so that's saying it's wrong

594
00:47:57.80 --> 00:48:04.20
That's right. Yeah, they're not saying it's wrong. Somebody's gonna be like hey, Andrew wanted me to go and take this building and the building is

595
00:48:04.60 --> 00:48:06.84
untenable the the enemy's too strong. I

596
00:48:07.24 --> 00:48:11.16
Need you know I make the decision. I'm not gonna take that building. We need to drop a bomb. We need to do something else

597
00:48:11.16 --> 00:48:18.28
I just that's fine, but I need to tell you and I need to keep the whole picture in mind because if that building was

598
00:48:18.68 --> 00:48:21.000
Strati-jiggly important for what we're trying to accomplish

599
00:48:21.48 --> 00:48:25.96
Well then maybe I have to take more sacrifices than I thought to take the building down

600
00:48:27.48 --> 00:48:31.72
The the decision must depict a clear objective aimed at with the whole force

601
00:48:31.72 --> 00:48:38.92
The strong will of the commander must support it often the stronger will gains success

602
00:48:41.80 --> 00:48:46.20
Without very good reasons the decision once made should not be abandoned. Okay, so this is

603
00:48:47.24 --> 00:48:54.92
Again critical without without a without very good reasons a decision once made should not be abandoned

604
00:48:54.92 --> 00:49:01.000
And then it says however in the vicissitudes of war and

605
00:49:01.88 --> 00:49:05.72
In flexible maintenance of the original decision may lead to great mistakes

606
00:49:06.28 --> 00:49:13.24
Timely recognition of the conditions and the time which call for a new decision is an attribution of the art of

607
00:49:13.64 --> 00:49:19.56
Leadership. Yeah, don't stick to the one plan that you came up with

608
00:49:19.56 --> 00:49:29.08
Doesn't work does not work in change plants you really have my I work for some hard-headed people and the plan would be completely falling apart

609
00:49:29.08 --> 00:49:31.08
And they're riding that thing in the ground

610
00:49:31.96 --> 00:49:36.52
They're just taking that they all know they think a real ownership of that real ownership of that

611
00:49:36.52 --> 00:49:38.52
They're not gonna let it go. They're gonna be right

612
00:49:39.72 --> 00:49:46.04
The commander must permit freedom of action to his subordinates in so far that this does not endanger the whole scheme

613
00:49:46.04 --> 00:49:52.76
He must not surrender to them those decisions for which he alone is responsible. So freedom of movement. What does that mean?

614
00:49:52.76 --> 00:49:54.76
That means decentralized command

615
00:49:55.32 --> 00:49:58.52
The attack is launched in order to defeat the enemy

616
00:49:59.08 --> 00:50:00.92
The attacker has the initiative

617
00:50:01.16 --> 00:50:07.32
Superiority of leadership and of troops show the best advantage in the attack success does not always come

618
00:50:07.80 --> 00:50:13.80
To superiority of numbers so go on the offense. I say that all the time go on the offense now

619
00:50:13.80 --> 00:50:20.28
Is this 100% of time no but you you have you're you're just that much better off when you're on offense

620
00:50:20.28 --> 00:50:23.32
You have surprise you have initiative you have the people on their heels

621
00:50:24.28 --> 00:50:26.92
It's amazing that we were able to take down the

622
00:50:28.04 --> 00:50:30.92
The island like the island campaign in World War II

623
00:50:31.48 --> 00:50:38.92
Going into those heavily fortified where the Japanese imperial military had been digging in

624
00:50:38.92 --> 00:50:47.40
for three four five years yeah preparing those islands for to defend against assaults

625
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
United States Marine Corps coming get some

626
00:50:51.80 --> 00:50:57.64
Seriously now you guys say Marine Corps and of course the Nihai the Army but dang

627
00:50:58.52 --> 00:51:00.52
Just unbelievable

628
00:51:00.68 --> 00:51:06.20
That they were able to that's that's going on offense. That's right. So momentum. Yeah. We're going on offense. Oh

629
00:51:06.20 --> 00:51:12.04
You've been digging in oh you built a miles long tunnel system to defend the silent cool watch this

630
00:51:12.36 --> 00:51:14.60
We're coming in we got naval gunfire

631
00:51:15.16 --> 00:51:17.96
We got course ares we got flame thrower's

632
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.80
And we're coming and obviously at great sacrifice

633
00:51:23.72 --> 00:51:25.40
But being on the offense

634
00:51:25.56 --> 00:51:30.92
Being on the offense is a weapon in its own right. I'm great notice this in strategic too like when you're on offense

635
00:51:30.92 --> 00:51:38.04
You're you're you have the edge you know you're you're one step ahead when you when you're on defense

636
00:51:38.04 --> 00:51:43.72
You're one step behind and it's not fun and if you're defending for too long

637
00:51:44.36 --> 00:51:49.96
Eventually you will get caught you will if you're on defense defense defense defense defense defense defense defense defense

638
00:51:49.96 --> 00:51:51.96
Eventually you will get caught eventually

639
00:51:52.76 --> 00:51:57.24
You have to at some point switch yeah and get on offense. I don't know who said it

640
00:51:57.24 --> 00:52:02.52
It maybe it's even cliche at this in these days, but you know the best defense is a good offense

641
00:52:03.32 --> 00:52:08.36
So you're on defense so you need to convert that to an offense so somebody attacks you you're on defense

642
00:52:08.36 --> 00:52:13.80
The best defense is a good offense. So it's my deep yeah, yeah, so my I'm a somebody attacks me first

643
00:52:13.80 --> 00:52:17.000
I'm on defense my best defense to that is to

644
00:52:18.28 --> 00:52:20.28
Return with an offense

645
00:52:20.28 --> 00:52:27.80
Yeah, you know what's interesting is a time when this is different is this is nothing

646
00:52:27.80 --> 00:52:29.80
I was talking about if the master is

647
00:52:30.76 --> 00:52:33.80
If there's if we're arguing about something

648
00:52:33.80 --> 00:52:34.84
Mm-hmm

649
00:52:34.84 --> 00:52:40.84
If my if I go with that theory the best defense is a good offense and you start to try and tell me something

650
00:52:40.84 --> 00:52:44.12
That's not jumping and cut you off and I'm like no we do like this. That's actually wrong

651
00:52:44.28 --> 00:52:47.48
I agree with you and that's interesting right interesting because

652
00:52:47.48 --> 00:52:50.04
And I see that all the time because leaders

653
00:52:50.84 --> 00:52:54.68
People end up in leadership position their personality kind of drives them to be

654
00:52:55.64 --> 00:52:57.64
Sort of

655
00:52:57.64 --> 00:53:01.48
Spoken and speak up and all those things when the reality is the the

656
00:53:02.28 --> 00:53:07.72
More senior you get in leadership position the more you should actually use this this the years, you know

657
00:53:07.72 --> 00:53:09.72
That what I said at the master was

658
00:53:09.72 --> 00:53:11.72
98%

659
00:53:11.72 --> 00:53:17.16
Use your ears 2% use your mouth. Mm-hmm. That's where you end up so this idea that

660
00:53:18.20 --> 00:53:23.32
That you know being on offense is the best way well when it comes to

661
00:53:24.04 --> 00:53:25.64
Discussions

662
00:53:25.64 --> 00:53:29.32
You should gather some intel before you act and listen to one other people have to say

663
00:53:31.72 --> 00:53:33.40
Check

664
00:53:33.40 --> 00:53:36.68
The possibility that an attack may miscarriage should never permit

665
00:53:36.68 --> 00:53:45.000
The federing of energetic leadership from the first. Yes, we may lose doesn't matter. We're gonna get some

666
00:53:45.56 --> 00:53:53.000
Pursuit reaps the fruits of victory. It strives to destroy the enemy which destruction was not possible in the preceding engagement

667
00:53:54.12 --> 00:53:57.16
Only a through-going relentless pursuit

668
00:53:57.72 --> 00:54:03.000
Which prevents the enemy from gaining time to rest and recuperate saves ourselves

669
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:10.92
Sacrifices necessitated if we permit the enemy force another decisive engagement. No when you get them on the ropes go

670
00:54:12.28 --> 00:54:17.72
Put them all the way to the river and then toss their bodies in the river. It's one of the ones we run on here

671
00:54:19.56 --> 00:54:27.000
The defense waits for the opponent the defender seeks to prescribe the battle terrain that's important

672
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.04
Right if you're on defense you want to bring people into gear arena right the

673
00:54:33.24 --> 00:54:39.72
Defense is chosen when our own inferiority permits no other choice or if for other reasons

674
00:54:40.12 --> 00:54:44.92
It appears advantageous. I was just reading a note from a friend of mine

675
00:54:45.88 --> 00:54:50.92
A team guy who's who's grandfather was in World War II still life gonna get him on the podcast and

676
00:54:52.04 --> 00:54:54.84
When he did the island campaign

677
00:54:54.84 --> 00:55:05.08
And then went into like Japan surrender after the bombs and the Japanese were told on your gun in placements put a white flag

678
00:55:06.28 --> 00:55:11.24
Like so Americans were sailing in like the wars over sailing in I think it was into like

679
00:55:11.88 --> 00:55:14.60
I don't use it is into some big port Japan and

680
00:55:15.16 --> 00:55:19.56
When he was sailing in there was just white flags everywhere

681
00:55:19.56 --> 00:55:24.60
Everywhere and he was looking around he said it he said it literally looked like snow

682
00:55:25.24 --> 00:55:31.56
Wow there were so many weapons and placements and he just said I knew at that point that those atomic bombs

683
00:55:31.72 --> 00:55:38.20
Saved hundreds of thousands of Americans that would have had to go in there and fight until the end

684
00:55:39.88 --> 00:55:45.000
So the advantage of the defender as a defender you want to pull people into your

685
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.36
Into your zone to where you know what the Russians do right I analyzed terrain

686
00:55:50.44 --> 00:55:54.84
Yeah, channelized terrain perfect, but the Russians were the Russians do. Oh, yeah, you want to fight us cool

687
00:55:54.84 --> 00:56:00.68
Come on come a little bit further come a little bit further come a little bit further. What is it? It's September come a little bit further

688
00:56:00.68 --> 00:56:05.64
Right always it's October come just a little bit further. It's November welcome to Russia

689
00:56:06.36 --> 00:56:10.84
Negative 48 degrees. Hope you brought your words. Hope you brought your warmies

690
00:56:10.84 --> 00:56:12.84
Uh

691
00:56:13.72 --> 00:56:17.96
The defense is chosen when our own inferiority permits no other choice

692
00:56:18.84 --> 00:56:21.64
Or if for other reasons it appears advantage

693
00:56:21.80 --> 00:56:25.000
So if you can be an offense, but if you have to you go in defense

694
00:56:25.32 --> 00:56:30.28
Breaking off an engagement has the purpose of terminating the battle or giving up the former position in order

695
00:56:30.36 --> 00:56:33.32
Continue the engagement at a more favorable position

696
00:56:34.60 --> 00:56:35.80
In the ladder

697
00:56:35.80 --> 00:56:41.000
Instance delaying action is often employed. So yes, sometimes you have to retreat

698
00:56:43.40 --> 00:56:53.000
The retreat intends to avoid further combat the engagement must for this purpose be terminated and the withdrawal of the troops be protected

699
00:56:54.36 --> 00:57:00.52
The changing fortunes of battle demand often the passing from one type of engagement to another

700
00:57:00.60 --> 00:57:02.60
So sometimes you've got to

701
00:57:02.60 --> 00:57:09.08
Attach and sometimes you've got to defend that's what's gonna happen. That's the reality and Hitler was not

702
00:57:09.40 --> 00:57:15.40
Hitler got to this point as the war went on where he actually didn't understand that which is why it's the oligrod

703
00:57:15.48 --> 00:57:21.32
They left those guys and they did plenty of opportunities to retreat no no hold the line

704
00:57:22.68 --> 00:57:27.48
I did that I covered the book called Stalin grad from that from the Nazi perspective and

705
00:57:27.48 --> 00:57:29.48
And

706
00:57:29.48 --> 00:57:31.48
Those guys were

707
00:57:32.12 --> 00:57:33.64
Surrounded

708
00:57:33.64 --> 00:57:37.32
They were listening to the radio and Hitler was making speeches

709
00:57:37.96 --> 00:57:44.20
Talking about the brave sacrifices of them in Stalingrad they weren't even dead yet

710
00:57:44.84 --> 00:57:50.92
Like he was he was saying hey look they're surrounded but they fought to the end. They're still there. They were still there. Wow

711
00:57:50.92 --> 00:57:56.12
Talk about coward talk about being in your ivory tower

712
00:57:57.32 --> 00:58:00.36
He left those guys to die surrounded

713
00:58:03.96 --> 00:58:06.20
Delaying action avoids the decision

714
00:58:07.40 --> 00:58:16.28
It will gain time keep the enemy busy and deceived so delaying action. Let's let's let's let's let things develop a little bit more

715
00:58:16.28 --> 00:58:20.44
During the course of the battle the commander influences the action

716
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:27.08
most strongly by the concentration and increase of fire and through the employment of his reserve

717
00:58:28.36 --> 00:58:31.48
Distribution location and employment of the reserve

718
00:58:31.80 --> 00:58:34.84
Require careful consideration mobility increases the possibility

719
00:58:35.56 --> 00:58:38.20
For their employment always have a little bit in the tank

720
00:58:39.16 --> 00:58:41.64
You know always got to have a little bit in tank

721
00:58:41.64 --> 00:58:48.76
Everybody says that you know it's interesting about delaying. We're talking about like like the Russian so we're a little bit further and

722
00:58:48.92 --> 00:58:53.80
And going on in this next couple of sentences you feel whether it's an enemy whether it's a competitor

723
00:58:53.96 --> 00:58:56.28
You know when they're going on the attack they're also

724
00:58:56.28 --> 00:59:01.40
Expending considerable resources absolutely right so so if you can kind of think about it

725
00:59:01.40 --> 00:59:06.28
Judges who match a guy's on the attack and you're you're in the guard and you're kind of in a defensive position

726
00:59:06.28 --> 00:59:08.44
Right, you're kind of letting them use his energy

727
00:59:08.44 --> 00:59:13.24
Right, so let them keep using that energy use that energy in the troops are expanding it takes effort

728
00:59:13.24 --> 00:59:17.64
Logistical support to keep pushing pushing pushing and you're spreading further and further away from

729
00:59:17.96 --> 00:59:21.08
You know home base where you got all your support and then

730
00:59:21.48 --> 00:59:26.52
When they're spread and they've expanded their resources and they're down to just maybe the last of their fuel in their food

731
00:59:26.52 --> 00:59:29.000
No, it boom then you launch your counter attack

732
00:59:29.80 --> 00:59:32.28
Yeah, so and speaking of

733
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.64
We know what I brought up before about when you're I don't want to use the term arguing

734
00:59:37.64 --> 00:59:42.28
But when you're discussing something from a leadership perspective you're in a group you're in a meeting

735
00:59:43.16 --> 00:59:49.56
exact same situation let the other people talk and express their viewpoints because every time they express their viewpoint

736
00:59:49.88 --> 00:59:51.88
you have an opportunity to

737
00:59:52.20 --> 00:59:54.20
to listen to it to

738
00:59:54.44 --> 00:59:59.64
to understand it to hear someone else make a counter to it and hear their counter to the counter

739
00:59:59.64 --> 01:00:01.64
So you're getting all this information

740
01:00:01.64 --> 01:00:06.04
You're receiving all this information you haven't you haven't given up any you haven't used any bullets

741
01:00:06.04 --> 01:00:10.92
You haven't used any magazines you haven't you you've got everything and you're just observing I mean it's

742
01:00:12.60 --> 01:00:18.60
I think it was it's either a dick winners or but they wrote hey when when I let someone talk

743
01:00:18.84 --> 01:00:22.44
I know everything that they know and I I know everything that I know it's like well there you go

744
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.24
Keep talking because I'm gonna know everything that you know and I'm gonna know everything that I know and you know how you know how when you

745
01:00:30.52 --> 01:00:33.32
When you do something anything for the second time it's like

746
01:00:33.32 --> 01:00:39.08
Expo it's not twice as easy it's not twice as easy or it's it's

747
01:00:39.40 --> 01:00:43.96
exponentially more easy to make a decision so when you go into a room for the first time and there's a guy in the corner

748
01:00:43.96 --> 01:00:48.04
You don't know what to do with your weapon like it's hard and then you go into that room again

749
01:00:48.04 --> 01:00:52.84
Or there's there's whatever there's like a couch in an obstacle whatever and you gotta do you gotta you gotta make a decision

750
01:00:52.84 --> 01:00:54.04
The first time you go in there

751
01:00:54.60 --> 01:00:57.08
You see a new guy going in there the first the very first time he's ever done

752
01:00:57.64 --> 01:00:59.64
E jammed up and everything's the disaster

753
01:00:59.64 --> 01:01:05.88
He does it one time, you know, he looks at it and go okay, you step out due to again. He's exponentially better at doing it

754
01:01:06.28 --> 01:01:09.000
so when we're having a discussion and

755
01:01:10.12 --> 01:01:17.000
I get to listen and listen and listen and listen and listen and hear other people give points and counter points around a table

756
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.56
And you sit there and just listen and go okay, and you can assemble it all you can assemble the the strongest facts

757
01:01:23.64 --> 01:01:28.52
You can identify the biggest weaknesses and then when you finally like you said you've now

758
01:01:28.52 --> 01:01:32.84
You've now everyone has expanded all their ammunition, but you you have a full magazine

759
01:01:32.84 --> 01:01:37.64
You're magazine to if I've actually been filled up with more rounds because everyone else is expressing

760
01:01:38.20 --> 01:01:42.44
Their their points and counter points. So you just sit there and listen and then but by the end here we go

761
01:01:42.44 --> 01:01:45.80
Here's the plan and everyone goes dang jockels smart

762
01:01:46.52 --> 01:01:49.16
How did you do that? I just shot my mouth and listen

763
01:01:51.56 --> 01:01:55.56
All right going back to the book this next section communications

764
01:01:55.56 --> 01:01:57.56
Information reports

765
01:01:58.68 --> 01:02:00.68
Situation maps so

766
01:02:00.68 --> 01:02:04.76
If you think about it what leadership is is actually just

767
01:02:05.48 --> 01:02:09.08
Communicating with other human beings. That's actually what it is great

768
01:02:09.24 --> 01:02:12.28
You you have to be able to communicate what it is that you need to get done

769
01:02:12.84 --> 01:02:16.52
to other people. That's what it is. So how does that work?

770
01:02:17.24 --> 01:02:23.80
The reports and information of the enemy form one of the most important foundations of the estimate of the situation

771
01:02:23.80 --> 01:02:28.44
The decision and its execution you got to know what's going on and it here

772
01:02:28.44 --> 01:02:34.28
It talks about air and ground reconnaissance it talks about continual observation it talks about information secured through

773
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.32
Special means and I'm sure they're talking about

774
01:02:38.04 --> 01:02:40.04
Human resources you know a

775
01:02:40.84 --> 01:02:43.16
Human human intelligence so spies or whatever

776
01:02:43.96 --> 01:02:45.96
That's not human resources

777
01:02:45.96 --> 01:02:47.96
It's a different kind of story

778
01:02:47.96 --> 01:02:49.96
Human resources

779
01:02:49.96 --> 01:02:51.96
And then it says from the whole

780
01:02:51.96 --> 01:02:53.96
Whole

781
01:02:53.32 --> 01:02:57.72
From the whole of all these different things the commanders able to draw correct conclusions

782
01:02:58.60 --> 01:03:02.28
Apparently unimportant details in connection with other reports have

783
01:03:02.68 --> 01:03:07.64
Considerable worth and this is something that I always told us in the military when you come back from an operation at your debrief you say like well

784
01:03:09.40 --> 01:03:12.52
I remember this specific thing where did you guys find

785
01:03:13.08 --> 01:03:15.32
Because we my first deployment we would be looking for

786
01:03:15.96 --> 01:03:17.40
Weapons bill you know

787
01:03:17.40 --> 01:03:21.32
Munitions or something anything that they could be using to build ideas right and

788
01:03:21.32 --> 01:03:23.64
The question was always where did you find it?

789
01:03:24.20 --> 01:03:27.64
Where did you find it and I first I was like well we found in the bedroom, but where?

790
01:03:28.36 --> 01:03:33.88
Because is it is it inconceivable to think that if you and I were bad guys and I said hey man

791
01:03:34.44 --> 01:03:36.44
I'm keeping my stuff

792
01:03:36.44 --> 01:03:40.52
Taped up under my table when the but when the good guys coming they never find it there. Oh, okay cool

793
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.56
So I'll do the same thing and we I'm going this from an actual example we found

794
01:03:46.52 --> 01:03:48.52
Dead cord taped up underneath

795
01:03:48.52 --> 01:03:54.92
A Mujia Dean fighters table in his house and so this is like I was like oh that that's when it clicked to me

796
01:03:55.56 --> 01:03:56.28
Oh

797
01:03:56.28 --> 01:03:57.08
Well

798
01:03:57.08 --> 01:04:01.88
We should tell everyone that because they probably tell everyone right because that's a pretty good place to hide

799
01:04:01.88 --> 01:04:03.24
You know tables well this

800
01:04:03.64 --> 01:04:07.08
Tables have like legs, but then they've got things that the legs attached to

801
01:04:07.08 --> 01:04:10.20
So if you just look glance under it and it's up under there

802
01:04:10.20 --> 01:04:13.56
It's kind of hard to see right so maybe someone says hey this where I've been hiding it

803
01:04:13.56 --> 01:04:16.44
They've searched my house three times haven't found it. We'll find it now

804
01:04:16.44 --> 01:04:19.40
So we flip things over. That's why we break it now

805
01:04:21.48 --> 01:04:23.16
So

806
01:04:23.16 --> 01:04:29.96
It continues on every report and the best information are of little or no value when they reach to late

807
01:04:30.60 --> 01:04:34.36
Into the command for which they're intended. So yeah if you don't pass information timely

808
01:04:34.36 --> 01:04:40.76
Doesn't make any difference all commanders are enjoying as early and to the greatest extent possible to inform

809
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.08
The higher commander of the situation into transmit all important information

810
01:04:45.08 --> 01:04:47.08
Yes

811
01:04:47.64 --> 01:04:55.64
The one making a report must express himself clearly and positively. He must differentiate between what he has seen

812
01:04:56.52 --> 01:05:01.08
What another has noted or stated and what is presumed

813
01:05:01.88 --> 01:05:08.28
The source of the information must be stated suspicions must have bases

814
01:05:08.28 --> 01:05:14.44
Those are big yeah, I've

815
01:05:15.72 --> 01:05:21.16
You've got you've got to pay attention to those things. There's a big difference and that's why we use appears to be right right

816
01:05:21.16 --> 01:05:24.20
That's one of the biggest ones that they teach us is you don't say

817
01:05:24.92 --> 01:05:32.36
Hey has an AK47 or hey he's got a weapon if you can't confirm 100% that that guy legitimately has a weapon because it's a big difference between

818
01:05:32.36 --> 01:05:38.68
Oh, looks like there's something under his dish dasha, right. Oh, it looks like he's looks like he's got a chess rig underneath his dish dasha

819
01:05:38.92 --> 01:05:44.04
That's a lot different than he's wearing a chest rig right and he's got an AK47

820
01:05:44.04 --> 01:05:51.40
So it's always appears to be unless you can confirm it and there's a win. I did the mili masqueron here that

821
01:05:53.08 --> 01:05:55.08
Break down of intelligence

822
01:05:56.44 --> 01:05:58.44
of it going from

823
01:05:58.44 --> 01:06:02.60
Like the division level which was hey this is a

824
01:06:03.72 --> 01:06:05.72
I think they use the word

825
01:06:05.72 --> 01:06:12.84
The original word was like a suspected VC oh no it was like possible possible VC

826
01:06:13.88 --> 01:06:15.88
Coordination point

827
01:06:15.88 --> 01:06:22.04
Went from there down to like the brigade level then it turned into like from from possible to suspected

828
01:06:22.04 --> 01:06:27.80
Just a little bit of a different word yep, yep, then from brigade to battalion it was like

829
01:06:28.36 --> 01:06:33.72
Likely and it went all the way down when those guys when those when that Charlie company got those words

830
01:06:33.80 --> 01:06:40.92
It was this is a VC stronghold not only was it that this is a VC stronghold this civilians are no longer there

831
01:06:41.40 --> 01:06:47.72
The civilians there's no civilians there and what they had heard was on Wednesdays they go to some market this the

832
01:06:47.72 --> 01:06:51.16
The the the women and children go to this market

833
01:06:52.60 --> 01:06:53.88
And maybe they did

834
01:06:54.20 --> 01:07:00.28
But it wasn't like I mean does every single person in your neighborhood go and shop on the same day at the same time?

835
01:07:00.28 --> 01:07:08.44
No, is there hey Wednesday they got a Wednesday they got specials at the grocery store cool a bunch of people going out there not everyone right but the report that they got was

836
01:07:09.08 --> 01:07:12.28
There's no friendlies in this village all VC

837
01:07:12.28 --> 01:07:18.60
Wow and so as that escalated you know you tell that to a 18 year old trooper

838
01:07:19.16 --> 01:07:24.84
This is an enemy village and guess what they did they went in there and they killed they murdered everyone so

839
01:07:26.28 --> 01:07:31.24
That's why you have to pay attention those and I had this happen to me too. We we did an op on my first deployment

840
01:07:32.28 --> 01:07:34.28
We got a

841
01:07:34.60 --> 01:07:39.80
Piece overhead imagery and on that piece of overhead imagery there was a red axe on one of the buildings and all's like cool

842
01:07:39.80 --> 01:07:43.56
I mean this is early in my deployment. I'm like oh that's for the bad guys our cool we'll go get them

843
01:07:44.52 --> 01:07:46.52
We went out we hit this building and

844
01:07:47.96 --> 01:07:54.28
We cleared it you know blew the door off the hinges go in there start SSE while we're doing SSE

845
01:07:55.24 --> 01:07:59.80
our turps are interrogating or what's the tactical questionings?

846
01:07:59.80 --> 01:08:03.88
We don't do interrogation but do intact the questioning of the people the people are like oh no

847
01:08:04.20 --> 01:08:07.32
That's not me the person you're looking for is three doors down and

848
01:08:07.32 --> 01:08:11.000
And so we went hit it and we actually got the bad guy

849
01:08:11.88 --> 01:08:18.44
Well, when I got back I was I was pissed because I'm thinking a like we wrecked this person's house now

850
01:08:18.44 --> 01:08:22.36
You know, that's that's horrible. That's not good for our strategic vision

851
01:08:22.36 --> 01:08:27.72
What we're trying to get done here the guy the enemy the real bad guy could have escaped and so I asked the question

852
01:08:27.72 --> 01:08:31.08
I said who drew this who put this red axe on this building?

853
01:08:31.96 --> 01:08:33.16
Yeah, who

854
01:08:33.16 --> 01:08:38.52
Like what was it? Who and I actually said yeah, yeah, who and why and as I dug down into it

855
01:08:39.32 --> 01:08:41.32
they had they had

856
01:08:41.96 --> 01:08:43.96
through various intelligence sources

857
01:08:45.32 --> 01:08:46.60
narrowed it down to like

858
01:08:47.72 --> 01:08:49.72
this one area and

859
01:08:49.72 --> 01:08:54.84
this one area the center of that circle was the building with the red axe on it

860
01:08:56.20 --> 01:09:00.76
So that's my fault right that's my fault because I should have said okay

861
01:09:00.76 --> 01:09:06.84
So from then on it was my deal to say who put this red axe on why it? What does that mean?

862
01:09:06.84 --> 01:09:12.68
What does it mean? Yeah, I mean that red axe implied at the time that like that was the target house as opposed to

863
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
He there's the center of the ring and he could be anywhere in it. You would have it plan that mission

864
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.52
There's there's there's five houses in this ring and it's one of them. We would have cordoned off the whole area

865
01:09:22.52 --> 01:09:27.96
And if you you can think about all the different ways that intel can come in and every different type of intel that you could have

866
01:09:27.96 --> 01:09:33.80
Could come up with you know hey here's here's the probable chances, you know it's gonna be one of these houses

867
01:09:34.36 --> 01:09:42.28
So that was a big lesson learned for me and you know if your people people to know when we would make a mistake like that

868
01:09:42.68 --> 01:09:52.28
We would obviously we what we did is we carried money we carried money and we'd pay them for the damages that we caused and and we would more than

869
01:09:53.48 --> 01:09:57.08
More than pay for the damages that we caused it was kind of a good deal to get your door

870
01:09:57.08 --> 01:09:59.08
Block off

871
01:09:59.08 --> 01:10:03.48
No, I mean the thing is yeah, we gave him a good chunk of money and you know it was all documented

872
01:10:03.48 --> 01:10:08.04
We had a count for all that I mean I remember going with the logistics of that but but but

873
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.88
Nonetheless, I mean it's still terrifying those people who hadn't done anything wrong

874
01:10:13.88 --> 01:10:19.56
I was so didn't have their door blown off when trying to know it's absolutely horrible. Yeah, the money doesn't the money

875
01:10:19.56 --> 01:10:25.96
He doesn't it's a strategic loss. It's a strategic loss. Yeah, so that's why I was so pissed right this happened

876
01:10:25.96 --> 01:10:32.28
And that's why I was pissed at myself because I accepted that until as

877
01:10:33.16 --> 01:10:38.92
What we were just talking about hey cool there's the red X yeah, I must be the bad guy. Yeah, let's go hit that house

878
01:10:39.24 --> 01:10:43.08
so many examples in life and in business on that too people say something and you're like

879
01:10:43.88 --> 01:10:49.000
Well wait, did they say they they say they weren't gonna be there or did they say they didn't think they could be like

880
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.92
I mean there's just so many conversations that you can have about whether it's marketing in your business

881
01:10:52.92 --> 01:10:56.84
Whether there's something we doing with your family. He just clarified for a second. He really wait

882
01:10:57.40 --> 01:11:00.52
What did they really say did they actually say this?

883
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.24
One of them didn't really say that oh, okay

884
01:11:03.96 --> 01:11:08.12
totally changed it in it's in that moment. Yeah, it's a legend and that's in those moments as a leader

885
01:11:08.12 --> 01:11:11.000
It's okay well hold on before we actually go and pull the trigger on this

886
01:11:12.28 --> 01:11:18.52
Actually in case of combat we're figuratively right before we start marching let's just clarify real quick before we go push it off in this direction

887
01:11:18.52 --> 01:11:21.08
oh, yeah the the

888
01:11:21.08 --> 01:11:24.28
Rumor mill the gossip the he said she said

889
01:11:25.16 --> 01:11:31.40
Those things are just awful and as a leader you have to take a step back you can't let your emotions get a hold

890
01:11:31.40 --> 01:11:34.36
Being someone says oh, he said he didn't want to come to this thing

891
01:11:35.24 --> 01:11:36.60
Wait, oh really?

892
01:11:36.60 --> 01:11:39.40
Didn't want to come you didn't want to come or he

893
01:11:39.56 --> 01:11:44.76
His father's sick. Yeah, it's got a parent teacher conference and his kids really struggling in school right now

894
01:11:44.76 --> 01:11:51.64
So he he just he can't be there. Oh, well, that's a totally different story. Totally different story check

895
01:11:53.64 --> 01:11:54.84
Next one

896
01:11:54.84 --> 01:11:59.96
Battle itself provides the most reliable means of estimating the enemy boom

897
01:12:01.08 --> 01:12:05.24
What's the confirmation? Yeah, that's that's just legit. That's the truth

898
01:12:05.48 --> 01:12:10.04
Which means sometimes you got to take some risk got to take some calculated risk and figure out what's going on

899
01:12:10.04 --> 01:12:16.20
All of this is just is talking about preparing you know mindset the troops the tactics the techniques

900
01:12:16.76 --> 01:12:19.80
Logistics all of that, but now to now to okay

901
01:12:20.52 --> 01:12:24.60
sooner or later battles going to happen. That was a tough one in Ramadi

902
01:12:25.96 --> 01:12:29.24
They so there would be little checkpoints out in town and

903
01:12:30.20 --> 01:12:33.000
The checkpoints would be run by Americans and

904
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:39.72
Then eventually there'd be run by half Americans and half Iraqis and at some point it was okay

905
01:12:40.76 --> 01:12:42.76
Iraqis are going to have to run this checkpoint by themselves

906
01:12:43.64 --> 01:12:48.12
And that was a huge risk every time to see if they could pull it off

907
01:12:48.44 --> 01:12:52.44
Then the first several times it was not successful and

908
01:12:53.80 --> 01:12:56.36
We would turn over the

909
01:12:56.36 --> 01:13:02.52
Checkpoints to the Iraqis and there was there was I think three of them got over run. Oh, yeah

910
01:13:02.52 --> 01:13:05.48
Over run yeah and just mass casualties

911
01:13:06.44 --> 01:13:11.48
But that's what we what that's a risk that the commander had to take you know that's a risk

912
01:13:12.52 --> 01:13:16.76
Chromic frontal and at the time had to take you had to say okay we've trained them

913
01:13:16.76 --> 01:13:20.20
We've we've pushed them they've been out there we've done the right seat left seat

914
01:13:21.48 --> 01:13:25.88
We need to see if they can maintain and we need to see what the enemy's gonna do and so

915
01:13:26.44 --> 01:13:30.12
The first few times it got tried it was a horrific and

916
01:13:30.12 --> 01:13:36.20
And eventually we did get the level of violence down and we did get the Iraqis all just trained up enough that they could handle it

917
01:13:36.20 --> 01:13:42.52
But it took some we had to do what we're talking about right here battle itself provides most reliable

918
01:13:42.60 --> 01:13:45.96
Means of estimating enemies sometimes you got to take that risk it's awful

919
01:13:49.72 --> 01:13:51.72
Continuing on this next little section

920
01:13:52.04 --> 01:13:57.08
Called estimate of it's called estimate of situation period decision period

921
01:13:57.08 --> 01:13:59.08
Ha

922
01:13:59.08 --> 01:14:08.04
An estimate of the situation provides it's pre-seeds each decision it demands rapid fought simple logical consideration of the essential details only

923
01:14:09.48 --> 01:14:18.04
Our mission is the basis we proceed from it and determine what it prescribes and how we can best accomplish it

924
01:14:20.84 --> 01:14:23.80
Rapid fought simple logical

925
01:14:23.80 --> 01:14:30.20
You wouldn't think that you would need to tell people in the military and business in the world that hey when you're gonna make a decision

926
01:14:30.28 --> 01:14:38.28
You need to think simple and logical right how often do I see people making decisions that are not simple right

927
01:14:38.68 --> 01:14:44.84
And the logical emotional yeah just emotional decision making here this is why the and you know

928
01:14:45.80 --> 01:14:51.72
That general back had seen this over and over again in order to get to a point where he's making it

929
01:14:51.72 --> 01:14:58.36
Evident in this book that you need to be logical about your decision making process that would be like if you if you were to sit there and talk to

930
01:14:58.36 --> 01:15:02.44
Hey, listen guys here's the most important thing. I want to start off with about your decision making process

931
01:15:02.68 --> 01:15:04.04
Make sure it's logical

932
01:15:04.04 --> 01:15:09.56
You get laughed out of the room. We'll know kidding. Okay. Let's see what happens when we crank up the stress

933
01:15:10.84 --> 01:15:15.80
Yeah, people are not making logical decisions. You know when things get emotional

934
01:15:16.36 --> 01:15:18.36
whenever people are involved. Yes

935
01:15:18.36 --> 01:15:23.72
Like that's it and because that's just there's there's all those dynamics of those relationships and

936
01:15:24.44 --> 01:15:30.52
History and and way people talk and treat each other and it creates and then people become emotionally attached to their own plan

937
01:15:30.76 --> 01:15:35.24
And so he has to put it in the book to codify it as you've got to be able to

938
01:15:35.56 --> 01:15:43.48
Unemotionally detach and analyze what is the best decision that is gonna have the biggest impact on the battlefield or the impact the battlefield

939
01:15:45.24 --> 01:15:46.76
Yeah

940
01:15:46.76 --> 01:15:52.84
The character of the hostile leader and the hostile troops it may be used in estimating the conduct of the enemy

941
01:15:53.16 --> 01:15:54.68
especially

942
01:15:54.68 --> 01:15:55.96
If we have had

943
01:15:55.96 --> 01:16:01.24
Previous battle experience with those so you got to know you're going to guess that's patent right there. I read your book

944
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.16
As a determined decision

945
01:16:05.16 --> 01:16:13.40
Must be logic must be the logical result of careful consideration of all factors the decisions made will not always correspond to the actual

946
01:16:13.40 --> 01:16:21.000
Conditions presented this is interesting the decisions made will not always correspond to the actual conditions conditions presented

947
01:16:24.28 --> 01:16:28.12
Then the situation develops other than the decision

948
01:16:29.32 --> 01:16:30.84
contemplated

949
01:16:30.84 --> 01:16:31.88
he

950
01:16:31.88 --> 01:16:34.68
has the greatest prospect

951
01:16:35.64 --> 01:16:39.80
Of success who quickly and skillfully exploits other reconnaissance

952
01:16:39.80 --> 01:16:44.84
But does not change the decision except with compelling reasons so that's the same thing

953
01:16:44.84 --> 01:16:46.20
We were we were talking about earlier

954
01:16:46.20 --> 01:16:52.04
So you stick with your decision until you see that it's not a good decision and then you change it or you can do that

955
01:16:52.04 --> 01:16:57.000
Get quickly analyze that right that's how like Boyd said what they would eloup is a quick

956
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:03.16
You can go through that it would eloup than better you could out maneuver. I used to do this all the time in even it in task unit bruiser

957
01:17:03.96 --> 01:17:06.76
When things weren't going the way I expected them to go

958
01:17:07.64 --> 01:17:09.000
my

959
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.40
my

960
01:17:11.40 --> 01:17:13.000
strongest

961
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.60
Desire was to keep doing what we plan to do like okay look

962
01:17:16.60 --> 01:17:19.000
Oh we didn't expect to take contact from over there cool

963
01:17:19.48 --> 01:17:22.28
But we're gonna keep pressing through from the north or whatever

964
01:17:23.72 --> 01:17:28.60
And that was my that was my that was where I leaned toward I always leaned toward go with the plan

965
01:17:28.60 --> 01:17:32.52
You know plan your dive dive your plan right we stand diving here you come up with a plan

966
01:17:32.92 --> 01:17:37.80
You go out there everyone's walked through it everyone knows what the plan and we briefed it if you can stick with that you stick with it

967
01:17:37.80 --> 01:17:39.24
But

968
01:17:39.24 --> 01:17:45.72
Then sometimes you got to go oh, you know what I didn't expect what that and that is too big of a curve ball for us to handle

969
01:17:45.72 --> 01:17:51.64
I'm making an adjustment we're making a call and that's where we have standard operating procedures and we make an adjustment based on something

970
01:17:51.80 --> 01:17:56.20
That else that we've rehearsed a thousand times. That's right, so you've got to pay attention to that

971
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.40
Now we get into orders. This is pretty cool

972
01:18:00.84 --> 01:18:05.64
The order puts the decision into effect clear orders are an essential

973
01:18:05.64 --> 01:18:08.92
For the frictionless cooperation of all commanders

974
01:18:09.72 --> 01:18:14.04
For the higher commander the written order provides the foundation for leadership

975
01:18:14.84 --> 01:18:19.16
It is communicated to the lower units printed as a carbon copy

976
01:18:19.40 --> 01:18:23.24
Type written or written by hand or by technical communications means

977
01:18:24.28 --> 01:18:33.08
Frequently it is dictated over the telephone in every instance the most sure and suitable method of transmission is to be chosen

978
01:18:33.08 --> 01:18:35.08
Should the order

979
01:18:36.68 --> 01:18:38.60
Should the order be simple or short?

980
01:18:38.60 --> 01:18:44.68
It may be orally communicated it must later however be committed to paper

981
01:18:46.68 --> 01:18:52.28
So this is something that I talk about a lot and I always throw out this question to trip everyone up

982
01:18:52.28 --> 01:18:55.48
I say what's better communication email or voice?

983
01:18:56.04 --> 01:19:01.08
You know email or or conversation and everyone's conversation conversation conversation and and they're right, right?

984
01:19:01.08 --> 01:19:07.80
Yeah kind of because what goes on what goes on is if if I call you up and I say hey Andrew

985
01:19:08.52 --> 01:19:16.36
We're gonna do A B and C you good with that and you're like cool got it and then you go out and what I said is and what you heard

986
01:19:16.92 --> 01:19:21.56
You do A B and D that's right and I go what would wrong with you?

987
01:19:22.12 --> 01:19:25.56
And you say what you told me do A B and D? No, I still do A B and C and here we go

988
01:19:25.96 --> 01:19:30.04
We have a problem so that's why when you and I have a phone conversation I say

989
01:19:30.04 --> 01:19:34.92
We get done and I call you and I send your email. It says hey just want to confirm we're on the same sheet

990
01:19:35.24 --> 01:19:41.32
We're gonna do A B and C and you email me back and say no, I thought you said you want to be doing A B and D

991
01:19:41.32 --> 01:19:42.60
No, sorry

992
01:19:42.60 --> 01:19:47.64
I didn't articulate it right we're definitely doing A B and C and you say okay cool got it so

993
01:19:48.60 --> 01:19:51.88
verbal is great voice is great phone is great. Yes

994
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.84
But email is very clear now you flip that over

995
01:19:56.84 --> 01:20:02.76
Okay, now I'm just emailing you hey Andrew do A B and C and you're like wait, why is he telling me this?

996
01:20:02.76 --> 01:20:05.72
Is he is he told me this because he thinks I don't know how to do this myself right?

997
01:20:05.72 --> 01:20:07.72
You know it's like and then we get into this whole thing. Why is he?

998
01:20:07.72 --> 01:20:13.96
Long email is a long super steeped long emails that you didn't don't even read the whole thing because it's too long

999
01:20:13.96 --> 01:20:16.36
so what you want to do is you want to use both

1000
01:20:18.44 --> 01:20:20.44
This is this stuff here

1001
01:20:20.44 --> 01:20:30.36
The fact that this is why this is why I this is why I majored in English because when I was a young officer and I hadn't been a college yet

1002
01:20:30.36 --> 01:20:31.32
Luckily

1003
01:20:31.32 --> 01:20:36.28
So I was able to figure out what I wanted to majored but I could already see and there was no war going on

1004
01:20:36.28 --> 01:20:38.28
This is like 1998, 1999

1005
01:20:38.68 --> 01:20:40.68
I could already see that the

1006
01:20:41.08 --> 01:20:43.08
Written messages that we'd get the

1007
01:20:43.08 --> 01:20:49.80
They were so important to be able to understand and then you had to build a right a concept of operation that made sense

1008
01:20:50.52 --> 01:20:52.68
And so I knew I was like okay, well, I know what I'm gonna do

1009
01:20:52.68 --> 01:20:55.32
I'm gonna get really good at this and I realized that

1010
01:20:55.96 --> 01:21:03.16
This idea of communicating with other humans was the actual basis of of all leadership up and down the chain of command

1011
01:21:04.04 --> 01:21:06.04
And what really helped me a lot was

1012
01:21:07.24 --> 01:21:10.04
When I when I had to study Shakespeare in college

1013
01:21:10.04 --> 01:21:15.56
The thing is Shakespeare is very humbling because you don't know what the freaking words mean

1014
01:21:16.12 --> 01:21:18.12
Because they're barely English right?

1015
01:21:18.44 --> 01:21:22.92
It's barely English and any one that says they can pick up Shakespeare and understand it is

1016
01:21:23.48 --> 01:21:26.28
Lying either lying to you or they came from a time machine

1017
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Because it doesn't happen

1018
01:21:29.40 --> 01:21:33.72
So what I realized you know because at first you're reading Shakespeare and you're like oh, I must be stupid

1019
01:21:34.12 --> 01:21:36.12
I'm stupid because I and you know the

1020
01:21:36.12 --> 01:21:42.52
It's like no actually you wouldn't know that word that word hasn't been used since 1648

1021
01:21:42.84 --> 01:21:46.52
So why would you know this word? Why would you know the meaning of that word? You wouldn't know it

1022
01:21:47.08 --> 01:21:53.72
So you have to look it up and you got I got very it's just you know what it is it's just humbling so when I would get some

1023
01:21:54.84 --> 01:21:58.52
R-o-e from down from some rules of engagement down from the chain of command and I'd look at it

1024
01:21:58.52 --> 01:22:03.000
Go, I'm not really sure what this means. I didn't just go. Oh, well screw it. I'll just make my best guess

1025
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.56
No, I would get out of dictionary and look up the damn words that I didn't understand and then simple find because I you know if I don't

1026
01:22:09.72 --> 01:22:13.24
Understand what it means there's no way and hell you're in English major

1027
01:22:13.24 --> 01:22:17.96
Yeah, I'm an English major and there's no way in hell that some of our front line guys are gonna know it

1028
01:22:18.20 --> 01:22:22.20
So you got a translated form so this stuff about communications

1029
01:22:24.20 --> 01:22:28.28
Simple it's just yeah, it's got to be simple clear concise is what we say at echelon front

1030
01:22:28.60 --> 01:22:30.60
Simple clear concise that's the way it's got to be

1031
01:22:30.60 --> 01:22:32.60
F-

1032
01:22:32.60 --> 01:22:38.04
Continuing on them this is so good the more pressing the situation the shorter the order

1033
01:22:39.16 --> 01:22:45.08
Where circumstances permit or orders are given in accordance with the terrain not the map. Oh, that's good

1034
01:22:45.32 --> 01:22:49.88
So whatever chance whenever I can I'm actually taking you out there I'm actually looking okay Andrew

1035
01:22:49.88 --> 01:22:54.44
You see that hey over there. I want you to get you know put some machine guns up there because we're gonna salt through

1036
01:22:54.44 --> 01:22:57.72
You go okay got it now looking at a map. We're looking at the terrain itself

1037
01:22:57.72 --> 01:23:01.000
How often can you actually get eyes on

1038
01:23:01.80 --> 01:23:03.80
um

1039
01:23:05.16 --> 01:23:10.92
In the front lines and with the lower commanders this is particularly this is particularly so

1040
01:23:11.64 --> 01:23:16.52
We're important orders. It is often advisable to use two or more means of transmission

1041
01:23:16.52 --> 01:23:19.32
Which is what I just said and I tell that's company's all time

1042
01:23:19.32 --> 01:23:26.04
Hey, you want to get your you want to get your vision out to the company email it to them do a video do a conference call

1043
01:23:26.04 --> 01:23:30.52
Do a a poster that they can do it all get that message out there

1044
01:23:30.84 --> 01:23:36.04
Do you you know I hate to say over communicate because that implies it's too much but

1045
01:23:37.08 --> 01:23:39.08
Over communicate

1046
01:23:39.08 --> 01:23:43.40
When I think of over creamer kids like I'm gonna send you hey Andrew I'm gonna send you 48 emails every day

1047
01:23:43.96 --> 01:23:49.32
Yeah, I would know which one I was reading here is yeah, you know how to good conversation with Sarah

1048
01:23:49.32 --> 01:23:57.40
I'm sure I'm at the uh at mustard about this and about how in this day and age if anything people tend to over

1049
01:23:57.40 --> 01:24:00.52
Use email and we have these just swamped in boxes and

1050
01:24:01.08 --> 01:24:05.80
Having a in this modern day and age having a good plan in place for some comms discipline

1051
01:24:06.52 --> 01:24:10.60
Of and it's exactly what what you said earlier and then I've been using this in business for years

1052
01:24:10.68 --> 01:24:16.52
It's it's a conversation because you can get to the bottom line quicker because so much of the communication is

1053
01:24:16.52 --> 01:24:22.60
Non-verbal it's like tonality and then if you can do it in over a video of ETC or zoom or Skype or whatever

1054
01:24:22.60 --> 01:24:23.64
Great

1055
01:24:23.64 --> 01:24:27.000
So you get to the solution quicker because we're we're going back and forth on each other

1056
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.68
We get to this we get to that final conclusion and then you follow up with an email because then it's black and white

1057
01:24:32.68 --> 01:24:37.16
And then you have like the the confirmation of this is what we talk about it. Yeah, exactly

1058
01:24:38.36 --> 01:24:43.16
It is easy to underestimate the time required to get in order through of that's a good one

1059
01:24:43.16 --> 01:24:48.84
It takes me to take a little bit longer than you thought oh here we go. This is what you were just talking about too many orders

1060
01:24:48.84 --> 01:24:51.72
Especially about all during which the communication means may

1061
01:24:52.04 --> 01:24:57.32
Miscarry produces the danger of causing injury to independence of action or lower of the lower commanders

1062
01:24:57.56 --> 01:25:01.08
So if you're if you're trying to tell everyone exactly what to do guess what

1063
01:25:01.72 --> 01:25:06.04
Eventually that order's not gonna get through and you know what they're doing they're waiting to hear it because you haven't

1064
01:25:06.04 --> 01:25:11.40
Descentualized command enough you've you've trained them like a dog only to do what you tell them to do

1065
01:25:13.88 --> 01:25:20.36
In order should shall contain all that is necessary for the lower commander to know in order for him to execute

1066
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
independently his task

1067
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
It should contain no more

1068
01:25:27.16 --> 01:25:33.08
Correspondingly the order must be brief and clear decisive in tone and complete

1069
01:25:33.08 --> 01:25:41.80
Adopted to the understanding of the receiver. Oh, that's what I just talked about adopted to the understanding so you got to translate those big words in the ROE down to the front line troops

1070
01:25:42.52 --> 01:25:49.40
And according to conditions his peculiarity the commander must never fail to place himself in the position of the receiver

1071
01:25:49.40 --> 01:25:54.20
I talk about perspective all the time you got to understand the perspective of the person that you're talking to

1072
01:25:54.20 --> 01:25:57.96
They don't have all the context that you have you got to you got to recognize that

1073
01:25:57.96 --> 01:26:02.76
The language of orders must be simple and understandable

1074
01:26:03.40 --> 01:26:05.40
Clarity which eliminates

1075
01:26:05.40 --> 01:26:08.28
doubts is more important than correct technique

1076
01:26:08.76 --> 01:26:11.08
Clarity must not be sacrificed for brevity

1077
01:26:11.80 --> 01:26:13.80
So sometimes you got to go a little bit more detail

1078
01:26:15.80 --> 01:26:22.12
Negative expressions and changes lead to half measures and our objectionable

1079
01:26:22.12 --> 01:26:31.96
Exaggerations are equally bad orders may bind only in so far as they correspond to the situation and its condition

1080
01:26:32.52 --> 01:26:40.76
And its conditions so that's good one orders may bind only in so far as they correspond to the situation and its conditions

1081
01:26:40.76 --> 01:26:43.16
So as soon as there's something outside that you can't

1082
01:26:43.88 --> 01:26:47.96
You can't say no don't go across the line of the limit of advance ever

1083
01:26:47.96 --> 01:26:53.32
Because guess what you might get in the contact and the only way to get out of it is across that limit of advance

1084
01:26:53.32 --> 01:26:55.32
So you better leave some flexibility in there

1085
01:26:56.92 --> 01:27:01.16
Still it is often necessary to issue orders in uncertain situations

1086
01:27:03.88 --> 01:27:04.60
If

1087
01:27:04.60 --> 01:27:11.000
Change is in the situation are to be expected before the orders put in execution the order should not go into details

1088
01:27:12.20 --> 01:27:14.84
So if you don't know really a hundred percent what can happen if you have

1089
01:27:14.84 --> 01:27:18.84
He says still still it is often necessary to issue orders in

1090
01:27:19.56 --> 01:27:21.56
Uncertain situation you're still gonna give orders but

1091
01:27:22.44 --> 01:27:28.12
If change in the situation it's be expected before the orders put in execution the order should not go into details

1092
01:27:28.44 --> 01:27:32.84
In great strategic operations especially when orders must be issued for several days in advance

1093
01:27:33.24 --> 01:27:37.48
This extension from details is to be specifically observed

1094
01:27:37.48 --> 01:27:43.96
The general intention is expressed the end to be achieved is especially stressed

1095
01:27:44.84 --> 01:27:48.68
In the execution of impending action the main instructions are given

1096
01:27:49.24 --> 01:27:58.12
The immediate conduct of the engagement is left to subordinate commanders in such a way the order is fully executed

1097
01:27:58.12 --> 01:28:06.68
Descentualized command 100 percent mission and state. Yes, this is what we're trying to get done here's we're trying to end up

1098
01:28:07.48 --> 01:28:09.48
Go make it happen

1099
01:28:09.96 --> 01:28:11.96
In so far as conditions permit

1100
01:28:11.96 --> 01:28:17.48
It is often best for the commander to clarify his intentions to his subordinates by word of mouth and discussion

1101
01:28:18.20 --> 01:28:24.92
Yet he must not make himself dependent on his subordinates the decision in orders are therefore solely his this is

1102
01:28:24.92 --> 01:28:29.64
Hey, you talked to your patoon chief as a patoon commander and your patoon chief is saying

1103
01:28:30.04 --> 01:28:34.76
We should come in from the west and attack from the west and you go, okay, sounds good and then you get

1104
01:28:35.40 --> 01:28:40.92
Hit strong forces and you failure mission your goal chief told you coming in for the witness the use of those

1105
01:28:41.24 --> 01:28:43.24
No, shut up. It was your call

1106
01:28:43.48 --> 01:28:45.48
He made his recommendation

1107
01:28:45.88 --> 01:28:51.40
Continuing it is recommended that the written order which directs the activities of different elements to a common goal

1108
01:28:51.40 --> 01:28:55.32
Be paragraph and the paragraph's numbered

1109
01:28:55.96 --> 01:29:01.80
That's like I kind of left that in there because this is the kind of detail this manual goes into like number your paragraph

1110
01:29:02.04 --> 01:29:04.04
Yeah

1111
01:29:04.92 --> 01:29:08.44
That which is important should be placed first check

1112
01:29:10.60 --> 01:29:16.92
Here we get here. This is this is good the following sequences recommended for operations orders

1113
01:29:16.92 --> 01:29:25.40
Number one information so in the US military and in and in NATO as a matter of fact

1114
01:29:25.40 --> 01:29:28.44
We use something called the five paragraph order smiac

1115
01:29:29.32 --> 01:29:35.96
Situation mission execution admin logistics and command and signal that's what we use in the US military

1116
01:29:36.28 --> 01:29:38.28
That's sort of our abbreviated

1117
01:29:39.32 --> 01:29:45.80
True pleading procedures boom you use situation mission execution admin logistics and command and signal

1118
01:29:45.80 --> 01:29:49.08
So here's they're talking about operational orders the first thing

1119
01:29:50.68 --> 01:29:56.20
Information of the enemy and neighboring units in so far as this is importance of the receiver

1120
01:29:56.28 --> 01:30:00.04
So what is that that's the situation enemy situation and friendly situation?

1121
01:30:00.92 --> 01:30:05.56
Next the intention of the commander in so far as it is communication

1122
01:30:06.12 --> 01:30:11.72
As it's communication is essential to the accomplishment of the end saw what is that? It's mission

1123
01:30:11.72 --> 01:30:14.76
So we've got situation mission we've got literally the exact same thing

1124
01:30:15.88 --> 01:30:21.96
Execution is what we have next and there's is missions for the elements of the whole command

1125
01:30:22.68 --> 01:30:27.000
What's that yeah that's that's the execution that's what we're actually gonna do

1126
01:30:28.28 --> 01:30:31.88
for America we have admin and logistics next and

1127
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.20
They have

1128
01:30:34.20 --> 01:30:41.000
Orders for the light motorized columns the field trains and baggage trains the battle echelon

1129
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:46.36
And the remaining reserve elements in so far as this is if an importance the troops so what's that?

1130
01:30:46.36 --> 01:30:50.60
It's all the logistics the whole the admin and the last one we have is

1131
01:30:52.20 --> 01:30:54.84
Command and signal which is how you're gonna communicate and where

1132
01:30:55.40 --> 01:30:59.24
You know this is when you'd be briefing you'd say uh, you know hey as the task in commander

1133
01:30:59.24 --> 01:31:01.24
I'm gonna be on this ridge line

1134
01:31:01.64 --> 01:31:07.80
So we have command and signal the last thing that I say is command post and communications to and from

1135
01:31:07.80 --> 01:31:11.88
Wonder where we got some yeah, so there's the origination of smieck

1136
01:31:12.60 --> 01:31:16.92
It's you know it comes from the troop in fear

1137
01:31:17.64 --> 01:31:21.96
That's where we got good man how this book has it has escaped

1138
01:31:23.08 --> 01:31:27.88
Like my junior officer training you know what I mean like that's what we're trying to solve right now

1139
01:31:28.20 --> 01:31:31.40
Yeah, that's what we're trying to solve we can't solve it we can't go back in time

1140
01:31:31.88 --> 01:31:34.12
But I promise you there are

1141
01:31:34.12 --> 01:31:39.96
NCOs out there I talked to them all the time there are junior officers out there

1142
01:31:39.96 --> 01:31:45.08
I talked to them all the time they send me messages there are battalion commanders

1143
01:31:45.88 --> 01:31:46.92
That

1144
01:31:46.92 --> 01:31:53.56
That go through this and listen to it. So we're good. Yeah, we've worked we're taking care of the problems in the past

1145
01:31:53.96 --> 01:31:57.48
We're this is absolutely true. That's why I'm sitting here

1146
01:31:57.48 --> 01:32:03.80
It's literally why I'm sitting here because I get it I get a damn email or I get a message from a Marine Corps

1147
01:32:04.76 --> 01:32:06.28
Second lieutenant

1148
01:32:06.28 --> 01:32:10.28
That's in the game or I get a letter from an army

1149
01:32:11.64 --> 01:32:16.04
Sergeant that's leading a squad and it's like thank you got it

1150
01:32:17.40 --> 01:32:22.20
I got admit when I was a junior officer. I was so busy so busy, you know

1151
01:32:22.20 --> 01:32:27.96
Rabadiers you guys can't see that like with whatever I was tasked with yeah, I'd never had time to

1152
01:32:28.76 --> 01:32:35.16
Read a book like this. I read what books I was basically forced to read and I got through them as best I could

1153
01:32:35.72 --> 01:32:39.80
And the best leaders made me do those things because I was so darn busy

1154
01:32:40.04 --> 01:32:42.92
It wasn't a priority in me it met 23 years old to do that

1155
01:32:43.56 --> 01:32:47.56
But man some of these things I learned firsthand and like as you're reading them I'm like yeah

1156
01:32:47.56 --> 01:32:49.56
Why absolutely know this to be true?

1157
01:32:49.56 --> 01:32:54.92
But I learned it like by actually touching the hot stove myself, you know well they've berk was talking about it

1158
01:32:55.88 --> 01:33:01.16
When he was at the basic score is like they gave him a stack of manuals and it said read the manuals

1159
01:33:01.16 --> 01:33:05.40
But the problem is you don't have a context around them. Yeah, so that makes it much much harder to read

1160
01:33:05.40 --> 01:33:10.60
It's like distant you don't really and even for me when I when I'm reading something

1161
01:33:12.44 --> 01:33:15.000
With all the context I have around it like when I read it

1162
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.28
Like when I first started reading books that I knew I was gonna do on the podcast it gave me a new level of appreciation before I was reading because I was like oh, okay

1163
01:33:22.28 --> 01:33:26.04
So here's how I'm gonna describe this to everyone because

1164
01:33:28.04 --> 01:33:35.72
Just like we were talking about written versus email versus verbal right when you read the written word

1165
01:33:36.20 --> 01:33:38.20
It's different than when

1166
01:33:38.68 --> 01:33:40.68
someone is putting

1167
01:33:41.08 --> 01:33:41.88
the

1168
01:33:41.88 --> 01:33:43.08
Influence

1169
01:33:43.08 --> 01:33:49.48
On the right spot right the when you're using the tone and all that stuff and I mean it's that's coming from

1170
01:33:50.60 --> 01:33:58.28
That's coming from Colonel William Reader who had him oh I was reading his book to him on this podcast

1171
01:33:59.16 --> 01:34:05.96
And he's like this is very emotional for me because I haven't you know read this book since I wrote it and

1172
01:34:07.48 --> 01:34:09.48
It's very

1173
01:34:09.48 --> 01:34:11.48
Hard to listen to

1174
01:34:11.48 --> 01:34:19.24
You know it's like yes when you add the voice it's there's something more to it and then when you have someone that's a knuckle dragger like me

1175
01:34:19.32 --> 01:34:22.12
That says oh here's what this is here's what we're talking about here

1176
01:34:23.16 --> 01:34:26.68
Here's what what here's what this actually means here's what this translates to

1177
01:34:27.80 --> 01:34:32.84
On on the battlefield in the boardroom somewhere here's the way it actually works

1178
01:34:32.84 --> 01:34:42.28
So that's what's good even though we didn't get the ideal training we can give it to them now. Yeah, and I think it's so important

1179
01:34:42.28 --> 01:34:45.96
We talk about training and how important training is for preparation like

1180
01:34:46.76 --> 01:34:51.32
At least at the very least hey you got to read this book at the very least okay, I mean in the absence of that

1181
01:34:51.32 --> 01:34:56.04
It's like a complete failure, but at least go okay read these books, but you've got to find the time to do the training

1182
01:34:56.44 --> 01:34:58.28
Read the books and then as a leader

1183
01:34:58.28 --> 01:35:04.20
Sit down kid. What does that really mean when we go out and we operate in this way? Where are the lessons from this book that we can apply?

1184
01:35:04.20 --> 01:35:06.84
Yeah, really do it. Yeah, you know, it's like

1185
01:35:07.72 --> 01:35:08.68
For me

1186
01:35:08.68 --> 01:35:13.08
What I was reading about face and I read about face like when we were in remoddy

1187
01:35:13.08 --> 01:35:14.28
I read it for the first time

1188
01:35:14.28 --> 01:35:16.84
I'm not sure 100% sure when I read it for the first time

1189
01:35:16.92 --> 01:35:18.68
But I knew that when I brought it to a body

1190
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.72
I was like that's the only book I brought with me. Wow and

1191
01:35:22.76 --> 01:35:24.36
The thing is

1192
01:35:24.36 --> 01:35:27.24
I would read that like I would read that to fall sleep

1193
01:35:27.24 --> 01:35:30.68
Right, I just get up to my room. I would open up to a random page that rented enough times

1194
01:35:30.68 --> 01:35:34.44
That I don't need to read it from cover to cover but I'd open up to a random page and I'd be like oh

1195
01:35:34.92 --> 01:35:39.000
Oh, this is this is what I'm experiencing right now. Oh, yeah, okay. He experienced the same thing

1196
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:46.52
I remember one of the first nights I was there flipped it open and I start reading it and what it saying is

1197
01:35:47.48 --> 01:35:54.60
He they're working with the South Vietnamese military and the South Vietnamese military was untrained on a quipped

1198
01:35:54.60 --> 01:36:03.40
Um, they were they were totally devoid of any kind of ethics in terms of money and you know it was cropped

1199
01:36:04.12 --> 01:36:09.32
So I was like okay, so he so in Vietnam they were doing the exact same thing that we're dealing with here

1200
01:36:09.32 --> 01:36:10.28
Okay cool

1201
01:36:10.28 --> 01:36:12.28
Let's look at how he dealt with it. You know what I mean?

1202
01:36:12.52 --> 01:36:15.56
Look there that's the person that actually made me say

1203
01:36:16.12 --> 01:36:17.08
Okay

1204
01:36:17.08 --> 01:36:21.80
The Iraqi soldiers are not going to be like us they have a different culture

1205
01:36:21.80 --> 01:36:26.44
They they run things a different way. It's not it's not wrong

1206
01:36:27.24 --> 01:36:32.52
It's just different from the way we do think the classic cases the Iraqi officers

1207
01:36:32.84 --> 01:36:36.68
Skimming money right off the enlisted guys paychecks right and

1208
01:36:37.16 --> 01:36:40.20
We're to us this is like a total

1209
01:36:41.16 --> 01:36:47.24
Total sin right the ultimate sin you're gonna steal money from your enlisted troops for them

1210
01:36:48.12 --> 01:36:49.80
The enlisted guys

1211
01:36:49.80 --> 01:36:55.000
That's what they expect yeah, they take he's the boss. Yeah, hey, he's gonna take a little bit. He's gonna take his little cut

1212
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.40
Of course, he's the boss. You know what are we doing?

1213
01:36:57.72 --> 01:37:00.84
We're he's gonna he's still generous us, you know, he's not taking all of it

1214
01:37:00.84 --> 01:37:04.04
Right and we had to get that through our minds. You know that

1215
01:37:04.84 --> 01:37:10.60
That that their attitude their cult their culturally different and so if we swaced a bunch of time

1216
01:37:10.60 --> 01:37:14.36
Trying to sort out their pay they're all looking at us going what are you doing?

1217
01:37:14.36 --> 01:37:19.96
What why are you trying to create a conflict with us we I'm the boss. I'm gonna take my cut

1218
01:37:19.96 --> 01:37:25.72
What are you talking about right to them? It's just as simple as that's how it's just how it is. Yeah, you know

1219
01:37:26.76 --> 01:37:28.76
And and so

1220
01:37:28.76 --> 01:37:31.96
For me like reading about face that was that was the book that really

1221
01:37:32.68 --> 01:37:34.44
Tuned me into okay

1222
01:37:34.44 --> 01:37:36.44
There are less this here. I mean that's why

1223
01:37:36.68 --> 01:37:40.20
That's why I named task in a prison task near prison because that's what that's what hack worth did

1224
01:37:40.44 --> 01:37:42.44
100% stolen from hack worth

1225
01:37:42.44 --> 01:37:48.20
100% but all the little things cover movie talks about there talks about decentralized command all the time

1226
01:37:48.20 --> 01:37:52.52
Talks about all those things are there he doesn't it's not even a leadership book it's all in there though

1227
01:37:53.56 --> 01:37:57.000
So yes, these types of situations where

1228
01:37:58.04 --> 01:38:00.04
The other thing that happens is

1229
01:38:00.04 --> 01:38:04.04
Everything we've said so far right just every topic that we've talked about

1230
01:38:04.92 --> 01:38:08.12
Is in extreme ownership it's in the dichotomy of leadership it's all in there

1231
01:38:08.12 --> 01:38:14.52
But all of it is a different angle and just like when you when you experience the same thing

1232
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.72
But from a little bit of different angle you know it better that's right you know it if I teach you an armlock

1233
01:38:20.28 --> 01:38:23.000
And then dean teaches you an armlock and then Andy teaches an armlock

1234
01:38:23.64 --> 01:38:30.44
You got little something different from each one of us. It's just a little different sign a little different movement and you get better at it

1235
01:38:31.40 --> 01:38:35.56
Same thing happens here you you hear that same message maybe in a little different way

1236
01:38:35.56 --> 01:38:38.92
Maybe a little different spin on it maybe shown in a different scenario

1237
01:38:39.24 --> 01:38:44.92
You actually learn from it and that's what's important because the more you the more

1238
01:38:46.04 --> 01:38:51.000
The more variations of the same thing you've seen the better off the better you understand it

1239
01:38:51.32 --> 01:38:58.36
And it makes you that much better and if you see the way if you know the way broadly you see it and all things and the more you see it the more you know it

1240
01:38:59.72 --> 01:39:01.72
So yes

1241
01:39:02.44 --> 01:39:04.44
That's the way it should be

1242
01:39:04.44 --> 01:39:06.44
That's the way it should be

1243
01:39:07.16 --> 01:39:09.16
Continuing on

1244
01:39:14.36 --> 01:39:22.04
Suppositions and expectations are to be so indicated reasons for the measures ordered belong only

1245
01:39:22.68 --> 01:39:24.68
exceptionally in the order

1246
01:39:24.68 --> 01:39:32.92
Detailed instructions covering all possible contingencies which are matters of training do not belong in an order

1247
01:39:35.40 --> 01:39:39.56
It's interesting they say suppositions and expectations of what we call those in the military column assumptions

1248
01:39:39.96 --> 01:39:41.96
We just talked about that. I do. Nope. Me lie

1249
01:39:44.52 --> 01:39:46.92
It is often suitable to issue a warning order

1250
01:39:47.80 --> 01:39:52.20
Warning order informs the latest developments of the situation it is used to affect with the most origin

1251
01:39:52.20 --> 01:39:56.04
Preparations likewise it is used to permit the troops to come to rest

1252
01:39:56.60 --> 01:40:04.20
Earlier and also permit them to plan to rest longer so warning order something that we also use

1253
01:40:08.04 --> 01:40:10.04
Another section here

1254
01:40:10.04 --> 01:40:18.28
When an order or report is transmitted orally the one bearing the order or report must repeat it to the issuing person

1255
01:40:18.28 --> 01:40:25.32
A person transmitting a written report should be instructed as to its contents in so far as conditions permit

1256
01:40:25.72 --> 01:40:32.04
Officers transmitting orders should as a rule be instructed as to the tactical situation. It's funny even in the teams

1257
01:40:32.68 --> 01:40:39.80
When someone says peel right everyone repeats the call you repeat it back to the person that just told you and then you repeat it to the next person

1258
01:40:39.80 --> 01:40:51.80
The place of the commander and his staff this is the next section we're going into the personal effect of the commander on the troops is of great importance

1259
01:40:52.36 --> 01:41:00.92
He must be near the fighting troops the choice of location for the core commander should be based upon the requirement of the establishment of

1260
01:41:01.24 --> 01:41:06.76
Rapid and continuous communication to the divisions and the rear. He cannot rely along technical communications

1261
01:41:06.76 --> 01:41:14.52
Meaning telephone wires and all that we can do better with this now, but back in the day and even even so

1262
01:41:15.40 --> 01:41:18.12
There's nothing that beats face to face nothing nothing

1263
01:41:18.84 --> 01:41:24.04
Nothing beats beats face to face great distance in spite of adequate communication

1264
01:41:24.68 --> 01:41:31.24
Facilities lengthens the command and report lines in dangers the system and may lead to

1265
01:41:32.20 --> 01:41:34.20
late reports and orders or even

1266
01:41:34.20 --> 01:41:43.96
Failure of arrival moral for great distance makes difficult personal terrain study and a personal knowledge of the process progress of the battle

1267
01:41:45.40 --> 01:41:47.88
The division commander belongs with his troops

1268
01:41:48.52 --> 01:41:50.52
boom

1269
01:41:51.24 --> 01:41:53.56
Don't get so detached

1270
01:41:56.68 --> 01:42:02.28
This section is called and we just I just jump through a bunch of really granular tactical stuff if you're

1271
01:42:02.28 --> 01:42:04.76
No, no, it's very good stuff to read

1272
01:42:06.20 --> 01:42:08.20
Good to jump through it

1273
01:42:08.60 --> 01:42:10.60
This section is called attack

1274
01:42:10.84 --> 01:42:13.08
Which is just a worth covering it's own right?

1275
01:42:13.88 --> 01:42:16.76
The attack is affected through movement fire thrust and through

1276
01:42:18.12 --> 01:42:24.20
Thrust and through the direction in which it is directed the attack can be directed from one direction against the front

1277
01:42:24.68 --> 01:42:30.92
But ordinarily the greatest strength is launched against the flank or the rear of the enemy more over and a

1278
01:42:30.92 --> 01:42:34.92
Tag can be launched from several directions with a breakthrough of the hostile front

1279
01:42:35.40 --> 01:42:39.80
New attack directions are provided so when you flank someone guess what there's gonna be other opportunities there are appear

1280
01:42:41.08 --> 01:42:48.52
The frontal attack is the most difficult of execution yet it is the most frequent out for the outflanking attack is more efficient than the frontal

1281
01:42:49.24 --> 01:42:55.56
simultaneously outflanking of both enemy flanks presumes considerable superiority and

1282
01:42:55.56 --> 01:43:02.60
An development of one or both hostile flanks and reaching deep into his rear can lead to the annihilation of the enemy

1283
01:43:02.84 --> 01:43:04.84
This is something that's very tricky

1284
01:43:05.80 --> 01:43:12.28
Because we talk about development of the enemy which means surrounding the enemy and

1285
01:43:13.56 --> 01:43:15.96
in a small that's cool

1286
01:43:16.76 --> 01:43:18.20
If you're in a

1287
01:43:18.20 --> 01:43:23.80
Battalion or bigger and actually I want to say brigade or bigger like we're talking massive battle field movements

1288
01:43:23.80 --> 01:43:30.12
Because when you get when you if you envelop if you have a if you have a company of soldiers

1289
01:43:30.12 --> 01:43:32.60
150 soldiers and you envelop the enemy

1290
01:43:33.16 --> 01:43:35.16
Guess what you're doing

1291
01:43:35.16 --> 01:43:37.48
This spread then well not only you spread then

1292
01:43:37.88 --> 01:43:41.24
When you surround the enemy you are all pointing your weapons at yourself

1293
01:43:41.88 --> 01:43:50.04
That that's the real problem so we're in into this a lot in in the teams where guys would want to surround the target and and there's some

1294
01:43:50.04 --> 01:43:56.60
It's problematic. It's very problematic. You have to that's why you know the classic L

1295
01:43:56.84 --> 01:43:59.32
Shapes whether ambush or L shaped assault

1296
01:43:59.72 --> 01:44:04.68
There's a reason for that. There's a reason why the guys in Vietnam taught us to do that

1297
01:44:05.24 --> 01:44:11.40
Because as long as you know what your fields of firearm you can you can go hot if you're in an L shaped

1298
01:44:11.40 --> 01:44:15.80
Ambush or you're in an L shaped assault the minute I put people

1299
01:44:15.80 --> 01:44:22.28
You know whether it's 270 degrees around the target or 360 degrees

1300
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:28.20
I can't I now I have to worry about my backdrop and it's a real problem and you know what you can get away with those

1301
01:44:28.68 --> 01:44:34.28
You can get away with enveloping a target all day long as long as there's no shooting but the minute the enemy starts shooting

1302
01:44:34.60 --> 01:44:35.80
It's a problem

1303
01:44:36.04 --> 01:44:39.24
So there are ways to cover exits from an L

1304
01:44:40.28 --> 01:44:43.48
You extend that a little bit you can put some overwatches in

1305
01:44:43.48 --> 01:44:49.64
But it is a real problem to think that you're gonna develop a target in a small you know

1306
01:44:51.16 --> 01:44:53.32
Let's say with with direct fire weapons

1307
01:44:54.20 --> 01:44:59.40
Company size or smaller. It's a real problem to think you're gonna be able to develop a target and not have a problem

1308
01:44:59.88 --> 01:45:01.64
If there's a big firefight

1309
01:45:01.64 --> 01:45:08.12
It's gonna suck. Yeah, and those lines those phase lines can get confused real quickly as we know and

1310
01:45:08.12 --> 01:45:15.48
But flanking the enemy is awesome and you should do it every opportunity you get in all aspects of life

1311
01:45:19.32 --> 01:45:24.52
Continuing a little bit more about the development the development presumes a frontal fixation of the enemy

1312
01:45:25.40 --> 01:45:29.08
So you you still have to lay down some sort of fire to make them

1313
01:45:30.36 --> 01:45:32.36
Distracted

1314
01:45:32.36 --> 01:45:38.52
The enemy is most certainly fixed if his entire front is attacked however such an attack demand strong forces

1315
01:45:38.76 --> 01:45:41.08
Which must be absent from the enveloping wing

1316
01:45:41.72 --> 01:45:42.92
Often therefore

1317
01:45:42.92 --> 01:45:49.16
Must the attacker be content with limited objective or faint attacks so you're trying to

1318
01:45:51.16 --> 01:45:56.20
Yeah, if you if you use every troop that you have to do the frontal front all salt well

1319
01:45:56.20 --> 01:45:59.72
Then you've got no one left to flank. So there's another cool thing like in the teams

1320
01:45:59.72 --> 01:46:06.52
You'd have the little assault force that was gonna move and so when I first was like going through SKT

1321
01:46:06.84 --> 01:46:12.36
Well, we just take all the big machine gunners and put them in the base element like you guys are gonna lay down fire

1322
01:46:12.36 --> 01:46:15.72
And then all of all the other guys with the with the M4s

1323
01:46:16.84 --> 01:46:20.84
We would be the assault team. Well, what happens when the assault team gets compromised?

1324
01:46:20.84 --> 01:46:27.40
They're compromised. They're compromised and now they can't advance

1325
01:46:28.04 --> 01:46:33.72
So now they lay down and start laying down fire will now the base force just became the assault force

1326
01:46:34.28 --> 01:46:40.28
And guess what they're holding yeah, but you have a weapon. It's they're not very they're not as mobile and even worse

1327
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.52
The now base force all they have is M16s and they're going ping ping

1328
01:46:46.52 --> 01:46:52.92
Right that's not gonna keep anyone's head down compared to an M60 right so I learned that very early

1329
01:46:53.08 --> 01:46:57.72
What you don't you don't and it was great for me because that was another thing that initially taught me

1330
01:46:57.88 --> 01:47:01.08
Hey, you got your standard operating procedures you got two squads

1331
01:47:01.64 --> 01:47:08.20
You know you got two squads in a pertinent cool one is base one is assault don't pull the heavy weapons into the base force

1332
01:47:08.36 --> 01:47:12.36
Because you might need them well, I think and two it's it's if the enemy

1333
01:47:12.36 --> 01:47:18.20
In the in their he's saying well the enemy is is fixed right you have it it presumes

1334
01:47:18.92 --> 01:47:25.40
The frontal assault like that's the main effort and and but if that shifts if they become wise to the flanking maneuver

1335
01:47:25.40 --> 01:47:32.12
And they begin to put more forces there than the whole thing just dynamically shifted around and so by loading up your base with your automatic weapons

1336
01:47:32.92 --> 01:47:39.80
Now you're now you're totally off balance. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. These are the little things that I learned along the way

1337
01:47:39.80 --> 01:47:46.60
Then I then I was like oh, then that makes sense. So there's a good reason to have you and a w or two and each squad us yeah

1338
01:47:46.92 --> 01:47:48.92
a w two

1339
01:47:49.32 --> 01:47:51.32
That's the best best position

1340
01:47:53.56 --> 01:47:57.16
Check here's talking about execution of attacks

1341
01:47:58.52 --> 01:48:02.52
Bases of the cooperation of arms so what are we talking about here?

1342
01:48:02.52 --> 01:48:11.88
Hmm the objective of combined arms and an attack is to bring the infantry in its decisive action against the enemy with sufficient fire power and shock

1343
01:48:12.52 --> 01:48:18.76
Action so that is possible to drive through deeply and break down the final hostile resistance

1344
01:48:19.08 --> 01:48:27.32
This goal is first reached when the hostile artillery is taken or is forced to retire all arms cooperating

1345
01:48:27.32 --> 01:48:37.72
In an attack must recognize their mutual capabilities and consider their respective limitations. They require continuous close communications with one another

1346
01:48:39.32 --> 01:48:44.92
The cooperation between the attacking infantry and the supporting artillery governs the course of the attack

1347
01:48:45.48 --> 01:48:49.000
full cooperation must exist in time and space

1348
01:48:49.48 --> 01:48:53.24
Throughout the attack and this is a little something that we call cover and move yeah

1349
01:48:53.24 --> 01:48:57.88
And what's interesting is how much they talk about communication

1350
01:48:58.44 --> 01:49:03.40
Continuous close communication with one another in the cooperation cooperation you know in the Marine Corps

1351
01:49:04.28 --> 01:49:07.40
When we covered when when they burn and I covered

1352
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.72
The tactics manual they call cover move

1353
01:49:12.28 --> 01:49:16.92
Cooperation that's what they call it and so that's that I wonder where they got that from

1354
01:49:16.92 --> 01:49:22.76
Yeah, well cooperation working together, but also look like break the word in two pieces. It's co operation

1355
01:49:22.92 --> 01:49:26.68
Right, so you have two different elements that have to even have different chains of command

1356
01:49:26.68 --> 01:49:29.08
Right you got an artillery unit you have an infantry unit and

1357
01:49:29.64 --> 01:49:35.88
You know we we saw this in our body, too. We're here. We are a naval forces unit with one set of communication method working with our

1358
01:49:35.88 --> 01:49:42.04
Mean Marines use different types of communication who own the battle space. We were guests in their battle space and we had to co operate

1359
01:49:42.04 --> 01:49:44.04
Right we had to co operate that meant

1360
01:49:44.04 --> 01:49:52.28
Communication working together to ensure you know that synchrony of effort and without that that's when you know

1361
01:49:52.28 --> 01:49:57.64
I wear we're gonna be operating this here. Where are you gonna be? What do you want to tell you? I got this kind of like this old

1362
01:49:57.64 --> 01:49:59.64
You know, so we will talk like that

1363
01:49:59.64 --> 01:50:04.12
That's not what we did and that's part of why we had successors because we co operate with the army and Marines

1364
01:50:04.68 --> 01:50:09.56
No doubt about it continuously yeah, we cover moved with them 100%.

1365
01:50:09.56 --> 01:50:18.12
It is the duty of both infantry and artillery just to cure their cooperation through mutual

1366
01:50:18.12 --> 01:50:23.64
Established permanent and effective communication. What does that mean? That means you better have a relationship with them too

1367
01:50:26.04 --> 01:50:30.60
Sorry to know you're about to read what I just said no no it's good. That's that's once again proving that

1368
01:50:31.80 --> 01:50:34.44
that actually what we're talking about is

1369
01:50:34.44 --> 01:50:43.96
Timeless and it and it and it should be obvious to people on the battlefield. It should be obvious to people

1370
01:50:44.84 --> 01:50:50.12
In the in the business world it should be obvious to people that are trying to work together inside of a family

1371
01:50:50.84 --> 01:50:52.84
Should be obvious

1372
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
But once again

1373
01:50:55.96 --> 01:50:57.96
The reason we have a business

1374
01:50:57.96 --> 01:51:03.80
The reason we have a business is because it's not is obvious. It's not just easy to execute this stuff

1375
01:51:04.44 --> 01:51:10.84
As it is to read it. Yep, it takes practice and it takes technique and and the best way to get good

1376
01:51:10.84 --> 01:51:14.12
out of this to do it but you're gonna make mistakes and you

1377
01:51:15.72 --> 01:51:18.36
And you're gonna learn from them you well you better learn from them

1378
01:51:19.48 --> 01:51:21.000
So

1379
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
That's actually a good place to wrap up this

1380
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
um

1381
01:51:25.16 --> 01:51:29.64
This document, you know this document this crazy document

1382
01:51:30.68 --> 01:51:32.68
Group in furok

1383
01:51:32.68 --> 01:51:34.68
Which is just

1384
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Tons of those lessons in there and

1385
01:51:38.28 --> 01:51:42.36
Either lessons learned most of March is lessons reinforced. That's what most of them are

1386
01:51:42.92 --> 01:51:46.28
Simplicity of conduct will most surely obtain the objective

1387
01:51:47.88 --> 01:51:51.32
Friction mistakes or an everyday occurrence. This is for those you out there with the

1388
01:51:51.32 --> 01:51:54.28
Um, what do they call it? A zero defect mentality wrong

1389
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
People are gonna make mistakes

1390
01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.68
There's gonna be friction. There's not you're not gonna get to do anything easy for doing something easy

1391
01:52:00.68 --> 01:52:03.32
Guess what it's you shouldn't move on and find something more challenging

1392
01:52:04.20 --> 01:52:07.72
mutual trust is the cherished form of discipline

1393
01:52:10.52 --> 01:52:12.52
That right there

1394
01:52:12.92 --> 01:52:17.24
When you when you think of discipline as something you're gonna impose on your troops you're wrong

1395
01:52:17.24 --> 01:52:22.28
Your wrong discipline is formulated through trust

1396
01:52:24.68 --> 01:52:27.32
Strictly maintain discipline is a better for tall and

1397
01:52:28.68 --> 01:52:30.04
And then this one

1398
01:52:30.04 --> 01:52:35.24
One of my favorites from this is the first demand of war is decisive action

1399
01:52:36.76 --> 01:52:38.76
Decice of action

1400
01:52:39.08 --> 01:52:40.52
That

1401
01:52:40.52 --> 01:52:47.000
Is what we need that's what we all need the words and the thoughts and the plans and the ideas

1402
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.36
They all mean nothing without action

1403
01:52:53.24 --> 01:52:57.40
And I'm definitely not saying that you don't need to think or you don't need to plan or you don't need to have ideas

1404
01:52:57.64 --> 01:53:02.52
But I am saying that none of those things matter unless you take

1405
01:53:03.80 --> 01:53:05.80
action

1406
01:53:05.56 --> 01:53:07.56
So

1407
01:53:09.32 --> 01:53:15.08
I think that's all we've got for tonight and if you want to take some action in your life and your world

1408
01:53:15.08 --> 01:53:19.48
Here's some things that you can do change the jitsu that's a good one

1409
01:53:20.52 --> 01:53:22.68
You're training right now, Andrew. I am

1410
01:53:23.40 --> 01:53:28.44
Check back on the mats of justice very humbling the last muster

1411
01:53:28.68 --> 01:53:30.68
I just woke up me back out of the mats. Oh

1412
01:53:31.24 --> 01:53:37.000
Because you realized you need to get your game back. Oh, it was just humbling. That's just the only way I can describe it

1413
01:53:37.16 --> 01:53:43.000
See you're lucky you had that jiu-jitsu you had the you had jiu-jitsu before a lot of people had jiu-jitsu because you were training in the 90s

1414
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:48.52
Yeah, yeah, so you kind of rested on those laurels a bit right?

1415
01:53:49.32 --> 01:53:55.32
Right? I yeah, well, and everybody else got really good and I got rusty. Yeah, yeah, I said I've been training

1416
01:53:55.72 --> 01:54:00.04
Not in jiu-jitsu anyway. Yeah, so back on the mats. Hey if you're if you're training jiu-jitsu

01:59:26.36 --> 01:59:31.000
One of the best I think it's the best selling business book since it came out extreme ownership

1506
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.36
That got to me leadership people say it's better interestingly enough. So get those to

1507
01:59:37.72 --> 01:59:39.72
EF online

1508
01:59:40.04 --> 01:59:45.88
We made online training four leadership because you can't just go to one

1511
02:00:02.44 --> 02:00:09.48
Online check it out and we have one more master this year. It's in Sydney, Australia all the other

1512
02:00:09.48 --> 02:00:14.76
Mustard we did we did Chicago sold out we did Denver sold out we had to change the room around in Denver

1513
02:00:15.72 --> 02:00:21.000
To because we had so much demand so we changed the room around that's not happening in Sydney

1514
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:28.28
Sydney is absolutely going to sell out go to extreme ownership dot com if you want to come I look forward to seeing you all in Sydney

1515
02:00:28.68 --> 02:00:30.68
And we're going to announce

1516
02:00:30.68 --> 02:00:35.40
The 2020 dates pretty soon. How do you like mustard? Oh, mustard is amazing

1517
02:00:35.96 --> 02:00:40.36
So good and you know teams need to come together. Yeah, you know you I mean

1518
02:00:40.36 --> 02:00:45.08
I've gone to events for years. There's nothing like mustard. You know running a business is nothing like mustard

1519
02:00:45.08 --> 02:00:47.08
And I'll just tell you that

1520
02:00:47.08 --> 02:00:52.44
Come as a leader for sure the value of bringing several of your other key leaders with you

1521
02:00:52.44 --> 02:00:56.52
So you're all hearing the material together. Yeah, it's one thing to go individually

1522
02:00:56.52 --> 02:00:58.04
It sure that's great

1523
02:00:58.04 --> 02:01:04.12
But the tendency is to come back like Moses coming down the mountain with the tablets and everyone's you're fired up and it's like okay

1524
02:01:04.36 --> 02:01:06.44
But when they when several of you hear it together

1525
02:01:06.44 --> 02:01:10.92
You can really implement change in your in your organization. Yeah, that's good going and we've seen a lot more that

1526
02:01:11.16 --> 02:01:13.16
There was some people some companies that brought

1527
02:01:13.16 --> 02:01:17.08
20 plus that's amazing the mustard the amazing

1528
02:01:17.08 --> 02:01:21.16
Indeed, we we set aside some seats so that they could be together right you're talking about

1529
02:01:22.36 --> 02:01:28.12
Like 20 plus people and there's there's plenty of companies that brought four yep, you know brought six

1530
02:01:28.76 --> 02:01:30.84
Some people come alone that's fine, too

1531
02:01:30.84 --> 02:01:39.48
But yeah, if you can bring a few people from your team and you can all hear it from the horse's mouth and you can all bounce these ideas off each other

1532
02:01:39.56 --> 02:01:41.56
It just adds that much more to the

1533
02:01:41.56 --> 02:01:45.72
Experience and just kind of FY when we do these we go to the hotels

1534
02:01:46.44 --> 02:01:53.88
The hotel people are like this is the most incredible thing this is the only event where

1535
02:01:55.16 --> 02:01:59.88
When the doors open at 745 in the morning after we do PT it's at 445

1536
02:02:00.68 --> 02:02:02.68
Combat shower

1537
02:02:02.68 --> 02:02:10.44
When there's people lined up waiting to get in there and then every you know the hotel staff will be like everyone so proactive and nice

1538
02:02:10.44 --> 02:02:17.80
And you know no one's rude. It's just like good people. It's awesome. Yeah, because what are people focused on people on folks not getting after it winning

1539
02:02:18.92 --> 02:02:25.40
And and and being good and I'll tell you to just some of the knives. I don't you don't see this in other events

1540
02:02:25.56 --> 02:02:27.80
For those you listen and life in jaco basically

1541
02:02:28.44 --> 02:02:30.44
They don't basically eat all day

1542
02:02:30.44 --> 02:02:37.000
No, every break so called life in jaco or sitting there talking to everybody and that's something that feedback that I see consistently

1543
02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:43.56
People are like wow, life in jaco and all the instructors are so accessible. Yeah, so it's not like the session sessions end and

1544
02:02:43.56 --> 02:02:47.56
Leave in jaco disappear back into their green room. Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're out front

1545
02:02:47.72 --> 02:02:52.84
So you get a lot of really good in her. I stopped saying no green room, but there is no green room at the master

1546
02:02:53.32 --> 02:02:58.36
So where where there if you think if you want to come hang out come hang out. That's what we're doing

1547
02:03:00.12 --> 02:03:05.24
At a course right now we have yeah, overwatch and this was cool to see this at at the master you know people say

1548
02:03:05.24 --> 02:03:07.24
Where can I get

1549
02:03:08.04 --> 02:03:10.04
Leaders that have these

1550
02:03:11.32 --> 02:03:19.000
Principles in their brain how can I get them to my company? Well, believe me, life and I've been at getting asked that for years and so what we did was

1551
02:03:19.48 --> 02:03:22.88
We created a company with Mike's Rally who's another

1552
02:03:23.48 --> 02:03:29.32
Ashland front guy another one of our brothers from to you breuser and and you know he said hey look

1553
02:03:29.32 --> 02:03:37.64
He's he'd been working with veterans transitioning into the civilian sector and he said hey, let's rock this and so

1554
02:03:37.80 --> 02:03:41.56
That's what we did great idea from Mike and so now we've got it

1555
02:03:42.04 --> 02:03:44.04
EF Overwatch whether you're

1556
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.04

Coming soon we are opening it up

1559
02:03:56.04 --> 02:04:01.80
We're we got another wing of EF Overwatch we're about to bring online which is gonna be for

1560
02:04:02.44 --> 02:04:04.44

In for triple tune commander right on infantry platoon sergeant so

1564
02:04:19.56 --> 02:04:20.84
We

1565
02:04:20.84 --> 02:04:24.12
We started with the community that we know we know it best

1566
02:04:24.12 --> 02:04:30.44
But the fact the matter is and you know this as well as anyone the the rest of the military

1567
02:04:30.44 --> 02:04:32.44
They're great people their great leaders

1568
02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.12
They've great experiences so we're creating something right now that is gonna open this up

02:04:38.12 --> 02:04:44.52
So we can plug in our great experience to military people from every branch from every

1570
02:04:45.08 --> 02:04:46.08

for every job specialty and and let them apply those leadership skills that discipline

1572

To the civilian workforce and make the veterans life better and make America better make the company's better

1573
02:04:59.32 --> 02:05:04.68
It's just a win win so we got that rolling out the next few months, but just a heads up on that one

1574
02:05:05.64 --> 02:05:10.20
And if you need more of this conversation because

1575
02:05:10.60 --> 02:05:15.16
Two straight hours of me and Andrew Paul is not enough then you can find us on the in-webs

1576
02:05:15.72 --> 02:05:17.72
We're on Twitter

1577
02:05:17.72 --> 02:05:24.92
Instagram and we are on dying frozen block Andrew is the Andrew Paul

1578
02:05:26.12 --> 02:05:28.36
And I am at jockel willink

1579
02:05:30.84 --> 02:05:35.32
Andrew got any close-knots get after it every day. I love your post, you know

1580
02:05:36.68 --> 02:05:41.000
None of us are promised tomorrow. Mm-hmm. Make us big of an impact you can every single day

1581
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
I've had a lot of time to think about

1582
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.76
Life and particularly recently passing on my grandfather and other friends of ours

1583
02:05:51.40 --> 02:05:54.52
At the end of the day we're only here on this earth for a certain amount of time

1584
02:05:55.72 --> 02:06:01.16
And I think the biggest legacy that we can leave is how we impact the lives of other people

1585
02:06:01.72 --> 02:06:03.72
And that can be at a small level

1586
02:06:03.72 --> 02:06:07.96
Doesn't cost anything to say a kind word to somebody to offer some encouragement

1587
02:06:08.68 --> 02:06:10.92
To show an act of kindness to hold the door

1588
02:06:10.92 --> 02:06:17.48
That doesn't cost anything and I think we can make a huge difference every day in just how we interact with other people

1589
02:06:18.52 --> 02:06:23.96
In kindness and in getting after it every single day so that when I meet St. Peter at the early gates

1590
02:06:24.92 --> 02:06:26.44
And I meet my maker

1591
02:06:26.44 --> 02:06:28.92
He says well done good and faithful servant

1592
02:06:28.92 --> 02:06:34.52
Chuck and it's interesting that that ties right back into this premise that as a leader

1593
02:06:34.52 --> 02:06:43.56
One of the most important things if not the most important thing that you can do as a leader is care about your people

1594
02:06:46.20 --> 02:06:48.20
Now

1595
02:06:48.44 --> 02:06:50.68
We learn from military history and those

1596
02:06:52.28 --> 02:06:54.68
Lessons are of course written in blood

1597
02:06:56.28 --> 02:06:59.56
Written in blood by the men and women around the globe

1598
02:06:59.56 --> 02:07:06.76
That have served that are currently serving that protect our freedom every day so thank you to all of them

1599
02:07:07.24 --> 02:07:17.32
Our police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correction officers and border patrol and secret service and all the first responders out there

1600
02:07:18.12 --> 02:07:20.12
same thing

1601
02:07:20.36 --> 02:07:21.48
Holding the line

1602
02:07:21.48 --> 02:07:24.12
Thank you all for keeping us protected

1603
02:07:24.12 --> 02:07:28.60
Here at home and to everyone else out there whether you're in the military or not

1604
02:07:30.04 --> 02:07:35.72
Whether you're a first responder or not whether you have a mission or you just have a job

1605
02:07:37.40 --> 02:07:40.76
No matter what situation you're in

1606
02:07:43.32 --> 02:07:45.32
It all starts

1607
02:07:45.32 --> 02:07:47.32
When you start

1608
02:07:47.32 --> 02:07:59.16
When you actually start when you take decisive action that's what you need to do you need to make it happen by getting up every day

1609
02:08:01.08 --> 02:08:03.08
Then getting after it

1610
02:08:03.48 --> 02:08:05.48
Until next time

1611
02:08:05.48 --> 02:08:18.92
This is Andrew Paul and Jocco out
