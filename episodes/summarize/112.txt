good job also excerpts on there if you don't want to listen or watch should i say the whole episode or episodes got some excerpts on there you can just watch little you know little excerpts little tidbits of the podcast little ideas little lessons tips of advice shorter form you know when you take a break at work or whatever check not that you should be watching youtube at work but if you are you watch this boom get back to work more effective probably probably also some other stuff on there i'm gonna try to slowly add more and more what should i say content not just for the sake of adding content by the way because i make videos from time to time very spaced out now we can all there you know i'm trying to get them done then the lessons we're gonna put more and there's gonna be more and more on there it's a new year and we managed this thank god as I told her once the disease started to develop she had rheumatoid arthritis very very seriously I said to her when she was a little kid said look kid this is gonna be rough man this is gonna be rough and and here's what you could do to make it worse it's like use your illness as an excuse you do that at your peril you do that a hundred times you will not be able to tell the difference between suffering that stops you from moving forward and an excuse for not living and you will be done it's never never never use your illness as an excuse like if you can't do it you can't do it you know we had a good experience without it's written in the book when we bought her a scooter because she couldn't use public transportation and we were all freaked out about that because like well she has damaged bones and you know broken hip and all of this is like you're gonna buy that kid a scooter yeah you and ten other people so there's even an element of chance at it especially at the end you don't like if you're in the top five you've done everything you can can do to control that outcome there's some element of chance that's going to be the determining variable because you know maybe I don't know maybe they didn't like the way your suit looked on you and that's the only thing that's differentiating you from the other candidate it's like you also don't want to take that to personally it's like what you hit the top five you were shortlisted you're in there man you're in there you're in the gap do that ten times you'll win one of those contests but you got to do it ten times yeah fair enough no wonder you're afraid of that maybe you should just shut up let's see what your life would be like in 10 years if you just shut up it's like you know how about it is now it's like it's gonna be way worse than that because you're gonna shrink and shrink and shrink and your boss is gonna become more and more tyrannical and you're gonna hate every minute of your life you know how like when people say it is what it is what it is what they're you know let's say it is what it is jockels not gonna be anyone but jockel you know jockels jockels right same thing then what you say that you know kind of i say that for the same reason also psychological warfare if you know what that is it's an album with tracks jockel tracks not jockel planning you could lay lay or the violin or what else do you play not play the violin i can't really play the drums too well yeah literally with the first time I had a Skype conversation with Pete my wife is like it sounded like you were talking to yourself right because we and we know there's a four hour conversation by the way dang real now with that that being said I wouldn't have made spats that look like the first spats to be it come out with a million years now here's now here's the funny thing but it's these little things actually matter they actually matter they have to straighten them out because your life especially with your wife is composed of about 50 little things that you do every day and because you do them every day they're not little you can just do the arithmetic you know it's like maybe you don't like where your wife greets you when you come home it's like okay is that relevant is that important and then maybe you can have a conversation about how to make it better and that conversation should be bounded too it's like the chicken thing is a really good my my father-in-law who I really like used to come my wife told me this story he used to come home for lunch eh and his wife would feed him lunch and she always used little plates and it was like they'd been married for 30 years and one day he had this explosion at the table about the fact that he'd had to eat off these damn little plates for 30 years and you know it was much more of a large explosion than it had to be nonetheless it's not of that it's jockel giving you so each track is joc a jockels how should I say tips that really tips they're kind of tips on how to eliminate the weakness that you're feeling at any given moment on your path on your campaign on the campaign against weakness that's what it is so if you're about to skip your workout because you don't feel like it be you don't think you have time or something like this or usually it's because you don't feel like it because you worked out yesterday your kind of sore like you were gonna do squats today but you did a bunch of parapise yesterday so do it do it badly it'll it'll help orient you in your life and we have a preponderance of of scientific data showing for example that people who've done the future authoring portion of this that's the plan are like 30% more likely to stay in university has an overwhelming effect and it works best on people who are doing worst which is really quite cool so there's that I have a personality test at understand myself calm and you can go there and get an analysis of 10 aspects of your personality it's kind of a harsh test like it'll tell you actually what you're like and it'll probably make you angry you know i don't really believe all that i just believe i don't feel like sitting around thinking about what i'm gonna wear in the morning just grab the i have a shirt or guess what i'm sure it's put it on right you have bigger things to make decisions about it think about that's exactly what i'm saying that's what i read too so you guys you and Einstein are like i don't want to say obsessed you're like you just real into to more important things yeah that's what you're testing for it's like can you take it lunch pocket couldn't right because people would laugh at his lunch pocket and he'd get all upset it's like well you have a stupid lunch pocket it's like you know your mum packed it how about it you laugh at yourself and they said oh you know poor lunch pocket it's like because they're all compassion I think no no not poor lunch pocket it's like clue the hell in buddy you had your chance you know that was a desirable job that real crew job in the summer because it was high paying you know like well you sound like this damn puppet what do you think about it's like well if I had to pick someone to sound like probably wouldn't be a puppet and then you're going to have to have a really difficult conversation or put up with it and that might sink your business especially if you're a small business owner so by not confronting the dragon when it's like two inches high and can only you know it's like it can bell-chowed something like a bit lighter you wait till the thing can inflame the whole room it's like well how many times do you have to send out your resume to to move ahead when you're already in a pretty decent job well the answer isn't 10 the answer is like you have to send out five a day every day for the next two years and the the rejection rate will be so close to a hundred percent that that's what it will feel like right oh yeah held him six people held him down to give him a needle it's like what was that so good it had some long-term consequences but see what happened so when you when you do that with people you don't teach them to be less afraid you teach them to be braver that's different and so like I had a client once the door is open on the elevator and she looked and we kind of talked about it before where you wait like wait like this many pounds or you know kilos whatever it's not created equal like if it's shaped in a certain form yeah please do and the more the better really because that'll also help keep my feet on the ground and keep me awake and plus it's funny and like one of the things about life is that a sense of humor that's a good thing to to arm yourself with because sometimes you just don't have anything other than that like my daughter when she recounts her the horrors of her and then you've got that down and the dinner times are like that too like a lot and lots of households meal times are really fractured which is a bad thing or they're bitter it's like I'm here's your goddamn food so let's figure that out so you quit whining and then let's figure out how you actually are oppressed and what might be done about it and then let's figure out a strategy and then let's help you practice the strategy until you get good at it and and let's also map out the consequences of not fixing it because people think well how can I stand up to my boss it's like that's terrible I might risk my jobs like it's like there you go that's what you're doing it's like you know you're you're because you think well I've got the devil I know like my daughter I think I forget how much you've been weighs now like 53 pounds or something like that you think the puns is nothing this far as lifting this for you lift it so after awhile she had to get licensed for it there's a licensing procedure and to do that she actually had to write a motorbike and so she trained to write the motorbike like not very long after she had her hip replaced I think it was a six week something like that so of course we're all freaked out about that too because it's like and it's like that's what you do you take away that you take away the joy of of being so heated and irritated by people that are making fun of you and you just kill it right there too jutsu and some sense well I had an experience with that about three years ago I'd put my videos up online and people kept saying that I sounded like kermit well one person said it so that's probably not a good idea right because I don't want to live with someone who's like stomped and angry about it because they're going to take their revenge like if they have any spirit at all so you cannot win an argument with your wife that's just wrong you can't you can make peace you can come up with a solution but if you win she loses and you know but more than that more importantly than that even while I was a dishwasher washer once I kind of got the hang of it which was a lot harder than you might think once I got the hang of it I was valued member of that team it's like while you're dishwasher it's like but what you talk about in the book is if there's a problem go attack it you can go get that problem solved don't go after that drag you know the dragons in there go get it well your observation is dead on it's like and this is the problem with being too nice like I don't what regard nice is a virtue or if it's a virtue it's a very low order virtue because what nice usually means but nice usually means is I don't want to cause conflict now even though the consequences of the conflict might multiply into the future so let's say you have an employee that's chronically I wrote so uh the kid mark he's getting made fun of by this he's a different kind of bully he's like a mental bully that that verbally abuses people and he gets called plate face by this character and to it eventually gets in trouble for throwing a something at the kid because he's calling him plate face plate but eventually way he befriends the kid is by he they have to do a self portrait class he draws a picture of himself looking like a plate and he shows the kid the kid laughs and all of a sudden their buddies okay I can't even say I can't even say hey Pete don't you know no one's gonna like those you know why because my sense of fashion yeah is so off my sense of fashion is not exist really it's like well what are you gonna do keep her in her bedroom you want to think that's a good idea tell her she can't go out in the world it's like have the damn scooter okay that's four and a half hours a day right for your whole life you think you're gonna like someone like that and then you're in real trouble but lots of times that's what you've got against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune it's like you see this with people especially people who've been through really hard times and they're witty like things will be bleak bleak bleak and I mean you you tread on that ground with extreme hesitancy because you don't say well man if I was thrown in the go like I would have been noble it's like no probably not man you would have been a trusty in about 15 minutes you know that's the most likely outcome so you have to be careful about not getting too high on your horse about such things so technically in the moment the statement is factual but the context be lies right whereas a white lie it's like well it's a little lie but you're trying to support a larger truth not that white white lies aren't optimal you know it's better not to lie but sometimes the best you can manage is a white lie and then maybe that's better pretty good I fear that sometimes people say well you know what I'm gonna do so I'm just gonna run around it I'm gonna tell the truth to everyone all the time on these little things that don't matter now my my my actual best example that I've ever heard of this we we had a guy in the podcast named Charlie Plum he was a pilot in Vietnam he was shot down in and on his last mission of his deployment he was shot down he was captured using the honeyhilton for six years this is the deal that they had amongst their roommates so they had roommates and it's run smaller than we're in right now so if you want to come register at extreme ownership dot com we will see you there and until then if you want to get on the path with us you can find us we'll be cruising on the interwebs on Twitter on Instagram and on that Facebook boku boha Jordan Peterson is at Jordan B Peterson he's also got the YouTube channel Jordan Peterson he's got Jordan Peterson dot com echo is at echo Charles and I am at jacca willink and finally thanks to all of you I know a lot of men and women in uniform listen to this podcast I hear from you all the time well we would not have this podcast if it wasn't for you overseas holding the line and keeping evil at bay and to the people in uniform here at home police law enforcement firefighters paramedics and the rest of you first responders thank you for keeping us safe inside our borders and to everyone else out there moving through life and that's good that's fine and they'll crack a joke and you think well thank God man you can pop up above that and see above it a bit and and like you know tap it with a bit of irony and thank God for that so when the comedians start to get silence there's real trouble and that's been happening to some degree in Canada you know comedians are increasingly not willing to go speak on university campuses and that's when the comedians can't talk that's a really bad sight because that's the that comedy that's the triumph of the human spirit over adversity right she's like she's a good piece like 150 pounds nonetheless the point there is with these maces and there's all this cool stuff to on there if you want to vary up your workout some colors you don't see like like if I was like and you think oh god I really don't want to know it's like I really don't want to know this it's called way the warrior kid marks mission it's a follow up the first book was fifth grade the second book sixth grade marks getting a little older guess what he so that's the problem to solve and he's gonna solve them so you can order that also as I already mentioned discipline equals freedom field manual that is available if you want to get bigger stronger faster smarter more disciplined better get that book and then implement it because you can get the book and sit sit around and play video games it's not gonna make you any of those things you have to actually get it you have to read it you have to implement it so that works also with the warrior kids don't forget you can get some warrior kids sop basically I got some did you get some not a bit man you know I'd do like them so you fix that you actually did tell that whole thing in the book so that's it's good is in there and actually the phrasing that you used when you say if you win an argument you said something along the lines of you win you win that argument they're the loser I mean he saw people in some pretty damn dire straits like really you know really beyond comprehension and he noticed even in those situations that people still have their choices to make you know people manage it on their own they'd manage it on their own all the time like you know let's say you're in a ratty horrible job and you're being oppressed by your boss and one day you think I've had enough and you go right your resume it's 12 rules for life is like it seems like a big claim you know
