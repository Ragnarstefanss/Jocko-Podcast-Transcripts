the the one quote I got was 94 there's a helicopter resupply to FSB 30 and 94 south Vietnamese soldiers forced their way onto the helicopters to get out of there including the commander that's on March 2nd by the way uh we get to March 3rd which which you've discussed a few times and and well actually let me jump into this small small portion of the book here that that talks about some of what you guys were doing I'm gonna go to the book here one officer Doug Walmack Wratler 28 and chalk 3 considered aborting his approach watching Arnie being shot down and hearing flight lead calling for mission abort not hearing anything else about aborting the mission he decided he needed to insert his load of arv and soldiers unbeknownst to him was the fact that no arv and had survived in the first two aircraft approaching the landing zone he was subjected to the same intense fire as the chalks perform upon landing an RPG rocker was fired but slammed into a stump and exploded showering the aircraft with shrapnel when it did time stood still for Mr. Walmack as it seemed he could count the main rotor passing in front of the aircraft several rounds ripped across the aircraft from three bursts of AK 47 fire the broder blades cabin lower fuselage and skids all received the damage as the aircraft lifted out of the landing zone hammer blows were felt by the pilot look and the pilot looked back not only were there holes in the floor of the cargo area but strange sounds told him that the main rotor might have taken some hits as well chalk 4 followed chalk 3 into the landing zone where it received intense small arms fire crashed and burned chalk 4 crew scrambled back to chalk 5 and rode out this kept up as each chalk came into the landing zone to drop off the arv and soldiers on board chalk 16 comment Kevin Chero 304 by Bob Morris entered the culture of fire and landed like everyone before him he could feel and hear the hits on his aircraft we're on fire someone said over the road radio but didn't identify themselves Morris pulled in power and initiated his takeoff very calmly he heard his crew chief say over the intercom Mr. Morris you do know we're on fire don't you Mr. Morris quickly returned to the landing zone and exited the aircraft chalk 18 approached the landing zone at 90 knots air speed instead of the usual 40 knots when so close he picked out his landing point just as a mortar round exploded at that spot suddenly his tail dropped low and the nose went high as captain Tate went into a hard deceleration with numerous hammer taps on the aircraft three feet from his touchdown point there was a loud explosion explosion a gaping hole appeared in the window frame and there was the smell of hot metal engine oil pressure was no longer steady but fluctuating arvon soldiers had no desire to wait for him to land and go out of the aircraft to safety of a prone position on the ground pulling in an armpit of collective Tate's aircraft tail number 049 raised out of the landing zone with the hail of small arms bullets chief chasing after him his aircraft had flown its last mission within an hour only 19 of the 40 year craft were able to enter the landing zone 19 out of 40 year craft were able to enter the landing zone Mars crashed in the landing zone came back in crash with another aircraft when in bird flumbaburke he crashed in the LZ they were on the ground one of the copolits kept in Jerry Cruz comment show been a second to him Vietnam first terror to his Ranger Jerry was on the ground with a prick 25 radio calling in air strikes and actually conducting the ground warfare in the LZ because the arvon officer major just Jerry knew what he was doing Jerry was the one that eventually said we got we got to halt this because there's too much crap going on in here and Kirk Latter obviously took it and we stopped the insertion for a while back and picked it back up again later on the afternoon that morning I we got hit by rocket propeller grenade as you've described the gaping hole in the windshield hit the windshield struck it was shot at about a 45 degree angle so when it hit the windshield exploded out instead of exploding in crout cheese said sir sir sir get ass out of here get ass out of here sir sir the nuts the inter panel which is our control warning lights look like a Christmas tree you look up and we took off it within within several seconds we started feeling harshness in the controls the hydraulic system warning light was blinking and within within another short amount of time we lost all hydraulics took both of us on the controls to select going down a highway at 85 miles narrow to Paris during goes out and you're coming up on some major curves it took us both on the controls we're finally able to get it back in called emergency case on we were like number two or three emergency at that time guys ahead of us who had gotten blown up on low low but I'm not it's kind of hard to because I flew so much I mean I flew over 1200 hours and I'm 950 of which were actual combat missions so I have to think that I did I never recall flying any what the call convoy support a lot of that would have been done by Charlie Marl and in Cobra gunships to take action no doubt in my mind that I fly supporting operations for duicane into but I never quite tagged it as as duicane into hell I had so much going on anyhow I've tried to keep my one armorses enlisted man and ten helicopters fly but the point of operation duicane into was to push up into case on which and get control of it and then that was going to then be used as a logistics hub and an air hub to conduct this big operation um Lamson 719 that's what the purpose was but in addition to that too was to put the south of it in these army in a position to where they could readily launch across the border so pre-staging all these folks all these soldiers out there and get them ready the the the area that you were going into had some serious enemy troops in there you know the you know some of the estimates I read 7,000 combat troops on the ground in that area of Lousy 10,000 support personnel another another 5,000 path of Lousy fighters so it was this was you were going into tough country 33,000 total is the estimate that's pretty much kicked around of all of all the categories you you just described so when did you win did you actually find out that that this mission was going down we got the briefing on at the mission actually started on 8 February of 71 by that time hunter first command post was in operation at case on general berry was up there Matt Jackson features a lot of berry in the book and I have some stories about that that I'll share with you later on off-loose several missions in support of that taking troops into hill 30 hill 31 range of arv and ranges were in 31 we flew so we have pick-up zones pz if you will at various stage of wetland and then take them to the to the LZ around there but that was just in prep 4 and really the big action for me the thing that I guess made me realize that my god there's a real war going on was in LZ Lollo which is on the third of March so I'll let to go back to the states a week after a week after Christmas and went back spent a wonderful time with my family New Year's Eve there with Fred Dickens by the time his wife Moe CEO for a kept friend and I left about a week after after that to fly back to Vietnam got into Tonsonoot and tried to get a what to fly up racer said I need to get up to Fuba and the guy said sir there's there's a major major operation a big thing going on he said I don't know when I can get you out of here I said I got to get out here quick if there's a major thing going I said he said we'll serve just stick around here and along behold within an hour they had a say say 123 flying that's 130 and one there's a big difference between those two R&Rs but you'd rather fly on a 130 anyhow say 120 there's only two engines so when you were flying those when you food sog missions I fought up skies we're monitoring everything on our company frequency and they had heard all the chaos and the horror that was being dealt to us and so of the 10 crew we all came back on those four ships because 11 ships if you count girlfriend and her ship they were all outside waiting for us to come in waiting their hats and we all landed and they all ran up and everybody was getting a hug and everybody was cold beer was on the on the flatline and and it was just a big celebration and especially because we brought help Morrison is crew of Bergen his crew Jerry crews we got them off of there and they were sitting on the floor to pull up down and listen to something that's the camaraderie and as I told Matt Jackson I said aviation crews are different rank is superfluous everybody is has a specific mission crew chief door gunner co-poly aircraft commander everybody has a specific mission but nobody can do that one mission by themselves it takes all of us working together as a team and I don't care if I'm a captain and you're a spec for crew chief I'm no better than you are and if it wasn't for you I can be flying as airplane same with the door gun that's a lesson you learn at it you learn a lot about team you learn about personal courage you learn about personal responsibility you learn a certain sense of tenacity you can't be lazy you you the dedication's got to be there and that's what I experienced with these guys and being not everyone of them there was no lacquered everyone of them even the guys in the maintenance hanger that didn't fly those missions with us and many of them would jump into fly mission just to get out there and do it but even to the clerk that wrote the awards there was such a sense of dedication and camaraderie that I have never experienced in my entire life since then never in my 20 years in uniform and the 13 years that I was fortunate to serve as a civilian with the with the office of the secretary defense nothing nothing will ever compare to what I experienced especially in the Lamson 719 even the Commander Control North missions though they were hairy though they had some twist in terms I would have never expected and and and what we lost to crew on Commander Control North missions that's horrible but nothing compares with Lamson 719 and I think that's that's where the what we now see as air salt that's where it was born it was born there we had to think on our feet we did things that were written down we had to think on our feet and you're gonna know uh that you hesitated at the moment at truth don't let that be you that's all I'm saying leadership strategy and tax field manual code valuation protocols discipline you can free them feed field

it is also a gift it's a blessing and it's a luxury it's a luxury that we get to be here in this world with freedom and free will and the opportunities that we have which were given to us through the bravery and sacrifice of others do not squander this gift and don't waste these opportunities instead go out there every day and then get after it until next time the zeco and jaco out and we got her back on the ground we'll come to the hover we put it down at case on and the main rotor locked seized turned the chopper almost two hundred seventy degrees around from our landing head there were actually bailed tech reps up at case on looking at damage and what because they were riding their reports for hey this and this what we need to improve on on the newer models of the hui they were riding their reports they got told me he said sure you're very lucky he said you could have had that transmission could have seized in the air he said you guys wouldn't be here and it seized on the ground for an enter came over fifty holes that had wrapped and a locked seized through the misdeceased transmission that that that helicopter obviously didn't fly again that day that's two of them one day we uh I say we'd lost a lot of aircraft that day and it was getting night time um we had this guy that liked to fix this stuff called common trails stew and uh there were on case on there was actually wild onions jica pulled out of the ground and uh he had a bunch of guys collected that yeah look up for that also psychological warfare okay to know what that is it's an album with tracks of jockel each track is jockel telling you how to get through a specific and general moment of weakness so if you're in real real life if you have been a moment of weakness which we all do sometimes put in this album boom jockel will tell you why you should you know not succumb to the weakness if you want a visual representation of this stuff go to flipsidegames.com my brother Dakota Meyer selling all kinds of cool looking stuff that you can hang on your wall we also have some books and hey the books I talked about today undone to encourage is the series there's three volumes out right now covered one covered volume number one which is an assault unit as an assault helicopter unit in Vietnam 1969 1970 that's episode 275 of this podcast covered book three today lambson seven one nine book two is called metal of honor I'm sure we'll get to that book it at some point um you can pick up the series of books there just an incredible account that you have to read to really to really understand the kind of chaos that was going on we have a new book final spin I have a new book final spin it is a we don't really know what to call it literature it is literature of some kind and they were old kind of like when you think of a bomber right now like a world war two bomber you think of this old you know those were the most modern beasts of their time that was like getting those noise that was like yeah to a noise right straight up so well listen obviously like I said at the end there guys like major J.T. so I flew into Tucson and he had a couple don't at dollars there who were in the hundred and first they were there in fact stand married one of the don't at dollars barber and Terry Digan was a friend of mine she was there and plus one guy from bravo company the Kingsman and and another pilot but we partied hearty that night and stand parents just did a wonderful job of making us feel at home and so on and might have been there two nights I stayed because I had to have time to get my uniform cleaned up for a warm home I wanted to make sure it was strapped when my parents saw me and so I got my uniform got my shoes all spit shot everything caught the plane out of Phoenix and Terry was with me and Terry and I had a really nice relationship I mean it wasn't a sexual thing it was just a nice relationship we understood each other and she had left none two months before I did and she would write me letters telling me about how the world back in the States was not the world it was not the real world world world her what she experienced in Vietnam with the soldier and that was the real world you know we we would write back a fourth about that and uh I flew my flight took us to Shivas from Downers Grove Illinois so we flew to Chicago and then obviously catch a plane for Chicago to Charlotte and she wanted me to meet her parents and and I wanted to meet her parents too and now I could have probably had a relationship with Terry that would have gone beyond she ended up marrying an army ranger a several years later that she had known and not but uh kept waiting for her parents to come and my flight was coming up to go in a parent's handshot up and then I left out the the next day my parents stayed down all for a while but the next day was the landing on the move and we washed it after my girlfriend I washed that we got back into Hickory from driving from Panama City Florida and I wanted the things that when I first covered um Colonel Jackson's first book you know one of the statistics that he brings up in the book is there was 5000 Huey sent to Vietnam in 3200 of him were lost in combat did your parents know these kind of statistics were they nervous as hell were they talking to you about you know what was going to happen how did you feel about it um my parents I never expressed any worry whatsoever about being in fact I wanted to go to NAMM right after flight school there were too many infantry officers serving infantry aviators in Vietnam there were not enough slots for all the infantry aviators there were infantry aviators who were like I'm third in line to be a battoon leader as a captain and we had a briefing tent for the we were in the briefing tent Kirk Latter all were Kirk Latter's commander 223 aviation battalion and told us about the afternoon mission we got to get back in there we got more troops to insert and alone and and Colonel Fernando looked at me and he said I'm sure you want to go in there fly to your to your crews are on the ground and they're just so I don't know how to have an aircraft he said we take mine I said sorry said take mine but the only thing you got to take my crew chief with you but it just makes this feel like we're due for more explosions so you bring up a good point unless if there are explosions that's where they're gonna be she make a video or everything explodes I'm about to because of how much trash you guys talking about like I'll make a regular video and people will be like I'm I'm gutted literally gutted by the lack of explosions I know it was hard to disagree at the time I mean you know our explosions appropriate at every single situation maybe maybe not unless if they if the explosions are gonna be present you're gonna find them on this youtube channel along with everything out they also America didn't want to put any troops any American troops on the ground inside allows because they didn't like the way that looked politically so they decided well we'll run the operation using South Vietnamese soldiers but in order to actually execute the operation they were going to need to have American aviation because America was the only one really capable of doing that job of air lifting all these South Vietnamese soldiers in the louse and then on top of that if you're going to use the helicopters then we're going to use the air support to in the air assets so that that's sort of the premise of the operation and it's a big operation to go like I said the goal is to kind of put it put a halt on on the the portion of Ho Chi Mintrell that ran through louse and and and and and and and and and the head waters of that was in the town of Simone I guess the wars over I never saw that attitude our soldiers remain very professional soldiers that's amazing cause many on were just nineteen years old some bomber eighteen I had worn off sort of a twenty one I'm out with an old dude I was twenty five I never never once questioned our our ability as an aviation unit to do the job the mission that we were assigned to do even after even up until the day I left when I became the operations officer my last four months in country I got a chance to look at at the battle space in a different way because I would go to batayan and batayan ops and look at that then come back and put that into company ops and and work our portion of the mission our company's portion of the batayan mission and I'd bring the guys into the briefing room the guys are gonna be flying that mission and I'd say okay this is our objective right here now how do we get there we're here this is our objective our mission is this we got to put so many troops in there how do we get I'll tell you one thing that's interesting when you read this book and when you hear about this this operation you know most of the time when you think of oh what the what the Vietnamese are doing it's sort of like what the North Vietnamese doing what the Vietnamese are doing it's sort of like a hit and run it doesn't seem like these big conventional operations and if they did do a big assault on a base you know they kind of do it
