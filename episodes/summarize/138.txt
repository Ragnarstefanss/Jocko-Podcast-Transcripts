I guess we could say and get that one man I want to I want to hear that one I want to hear the Texas Batman get crazy in in Ramadi in 2006 this is bringing back some awesome memories here bright orange tracer streaked like laser beams just a few feet over our heads each supersonic bullet zipping past with a thunderous crack holy shit I thought as we quickly duck down behind the roof wall those are friendly shooting at us I looked over at Dave Burke who crouched down nearby like the other seals on the roof with us we tried to stay low enough not to get our head shot off Dave looked back at me and shook his head with a smile mixed humor and concern that's not cool they've said the understatement of the year Dave Burke was a US Marine Corps major a fighter pilot by trade he had been the lead instructor at the legendary US Navy fighter weapon school better known as top gun Dave had left the cockpit behind a volunteer to serve on the ground as a forward air controller in the most dangerous place in Iraq Ramadi he led a supporting arms liaison team or salt attached to the US Marine Corps fifth air naval gun fire liaison company Dave and his twelve Marines from salt six a company Charlie Batoon to coordinate with the aircraft supporting this operation in the skies overhead they patrolled him with us on foot to spearhead the operation ahead of the US Army and Iraqi Army units a US tank 200 yards away had fired a burst from its heavy machine gun directly over our position it was friendly fire a blue on blue in US military parlance to be killed or horribly wounded by enemy fire was one thing to be killed by our own american forces was something much worse that was way too close for comfort I thought in the seconds following as a crouches lowest possible behind the low concrete wall that was our only means of cover we had to shut that down immediately and alert the tank that we were friendly forces to do so I had to contact the specific tank commander directly via radio and tell them to cease fire the tanks heavy machine gun was a 50 caliber M2 Browning known as the Maadouce it packed a hell of a punch and US military service since 1933 it improvement its deadly effectiveness in every american war since World War I each massive round could take a man's head clean off or remove the bulk of his chest cavity it could also punch right through concrete walls like the one we were hiding behind we had just received a fully automatic burst of probably a dozen rounds in a matter of seconds if I didn't shut down the fire immediately and let the US tank know we were friendly it could mean horrible wounds in death for a number of us blue on blue it's even an extreme ownership we talked there's three episodes of blue on blue potential or blue the app with with Chris potentially shooting the american trooper that was in a in a building the Bradley getting ready to light up stoneers guys and also the blue on blue that the book starts off with there's it's interesting and a reality of war that we talk about blue on blue a lot in that urban environment the other thing I noticed is did I don't mean to accuse you here like you know on this in this format but each massive round could take a man's head clean off is that not just jacked from clean eastwood right there come on man that's 44 magnum that's dirty hairy yeah that caught a new leadership it's coming out September 25th if you want to if you want to get some you can get some of that we got some Q&A we got some questions to discuss here how does jump right into it number one what are speaking of that this is this is falling together quite nicely question number one what are things to look for when you're debating whether to raise your voice or yell due to those under you being lazy or unmotivated y'all talk a lot about the importance of self control and not just losing it but would you say there's a time and place for raising the intensity while still being respectful towards your guys so there you go yellin and scream it gets them sometimes you gotta just drop the hammer jocco yelled and scream it us all the time like I've I've talked about on this you know I think on the podcast we started talking about all the time and the number of times at jocco screamed and yelled at me zero zero times in all the years that we worked together and and I know I gave him at least dozens maybe hundreds of opportunities that we want to probably done that and he didn't do that because he realized it it wasn't effective so now listen there there is there is a time where you know if there's a major safety issue going on you're trying to get people's attention and you want people to cease fire or you need to rally the truth where you got to raise your voice and get people's attention yeah typically is not gonna happen but like the control thing right like you know you get a even a good blue belt is been in for a long time per belt up purple belt and up they're gonna know the control on a hill hook like if I you know purple belt doesn't heal hook on you the risk of you getting injured unless you don't tap or something like that is pretty low it's gonna be pretty low because they know that control of just their whole body and you don't know you should tap this is uh I gotta I gotta tell you look obviously I'm from Texas water burgers are all over the place and water burgers are awesome you can't go wrong with the water burger um in and out is uh it's pretty tough to be though it's uh there's something special about the internet I used to have you know over Pacific Beach I had a storage unit over there and there's like my storage unit was like right in and up or a hill those are good burgers the uh my storage unit was it would like kick the exhaust or like right back up into and so so like the exhaust blasting in your face you know from like 25 yards 30 yards away as I'm like there at my storage unit on the server for whatever and I think we explained that pretty well in this book and this this book was written just like extreme ownership that economy leadership was written to help leaders as a reference manual and and if it's something that you know if I see pages like we see so many cops of extreme ownership I mean I want to see pages that are underlined that are highlighted they're tab that are they're utilized by leaders and and if we've done that and this is a manual that helps leaders lead better and be better people and lead better teams that then this will have a accomplishes mission you know what's cool is is I think it's very similar to the fact that with extreme ownership right with that attitude with that attitude when you get in that mindset you start seeing it everywhere and you start when someone makes an excuse you recognize me that you go that's an excuse like echo is giving you a hard time about your your lack of a haircut and and you know you were you were saying that I was my fault and we're laughing about it yes you know well here's the thing about that when you kind of did take a step back it's like you you just went extreme you weren't wrong you just went extreme that's all you know you don't have to do the balance so this guy in Michigan he had the balance because he knows the extreme he knows about the value of the thing who he's in Michigan I gotta say for the folks in Michigan though like being up there in North Dakota doing to work like when you go to Alaska and you you know it's like pretty cool out and you got your jacket on he's looking on there's dudes like T-shirts just hanging out that's where it was it's all relative it's a long one can you explain more how you managed working with the local Iraqi troops general matters who I hold in the highest extreme a steam said something to the effect that if you are doing anything that negatively impacts relations with allied forces you are of more used to the enemy than you are to the your team this makes it quite obvious that he believes that full cooperation with allied forces is key to attaining victory it is a well established fact that most of the Iraqi forces were incompetent to the point of posing danger to US troops so what steps did you take to ensure success when working with them well obviously relations with your allies are critical it's cover move ready you got to work together as a team and if you're working against each other that's absolutely catastrophic I think for us with Iraqi troops you know again we talked about how that was liberating right for for you know the big pushback was always like we want to do just seal you don't matter what race we call just seals or just Americans you know just like NATO ally forces and not work with with Iraqi troops and you know when you said that right away attack that's good listen don't even put up a concept of operations we have a connoisse we call it which is the approval for the plan that doesn't have Iraqi troops on it well while you're not shooting at the enemy the enemy is maneuvering and they are getting high ground and they are getting a superior position and this is the exact same thing in the business world where I mean the the example of like hey we got to grow and so the aggressive leader the overly aggressive the hyper aggressive leader will grow too fast and all of a sudden has overhead that's too much and can't afford to go on but at the same time you get a you get a company that's not that's not aggressive enough and they should be entering another another line of operation they should be putting they should be entering another market you know we were talking about this morning while we were working out block blockbuster and blackberry right blockbuster and blackberry who would have thought that blockbuster which was there was a blockbuster on every street corner there was a block blackberry and everyone's pocket and they owned something like 80 something percent of the market share that they're done now are you telling me that someone that was default aggressive would have said you know what we need to figure out how to you know what these these these movies might be able to come on the internet in fact there's streaming video let's get into that market and of course they would have the capital they would have the infrastructure they would have the people and they could they would have been able to make that happen they had relationships with with the with the with the big Hollywood studios right they were getting sent those movies they had relationships they could have done that and it became really evident even though we have you know it's the last chapter the last chapter in extreme ownership is the dichotomy leadership and discipline equals freedom and you know we put it in there because we knew it was important but now after working with more people over the past few years it's become so obvious that this is like such a critical the being able to balance balance balance balance I use that word nine times in every paragraph because that's what you have to do if you're a leader and and we talk about this too and the opening of in the opening of the book and you know in the opening of dichotomy leadership we talk about how one of the problems with the book extreme ownership is the title extreme ownership because it made everyone just want to get extraordinary with everything I'm going to be super extreme and so that means you know what I'm going to do but get extreme on our own everything and we that was one of the earliest things that I started noticing was people that took so much ownership so on the leader I'm in charge and you simply observe you're gonna have a better time feeling like the meeting is effective and you will get the benefit of hearing all these different voices which is good which is good to hear all these different opinions and voices and be able to pick through and sort through and that's gonna give you more benefit than you know what I get there's two it's going on this meeting only give me two people and we'll make the decisions well there's some people number number the six person that person had a good input right the 12 person might had some good input so again is there balance yes are there certain decisions that you kind of need to take and really dive down in with a small group absolutely but is it good sometimes to let things air out and let someone run a meeting and you listen and you learn kind of what the overall atmosphere is in the situation are absolutely that's my answer I think it's a great one it helps people it helps people listen to you as well so the the main thing that sticks out main thing is that is what people seem to ask you all the time is what do I do when other people aren't taking extreme ownership and here's thing when you're outside and listening you're like a high see what you know it's almost like a funny question right because like what what do you call that like ironic right kind of or they're like what do you do when other people yeah even though this is going to be the undisputed champion of comfort according to kind of sorry and and rash guards I wear I wear the rash guard when I'm working out some days the days I wear it when I'm working out it's long sleeve is when I'm doing a lot of stuff on the rings so my arms don't get all chafed up which is a comfort move if you break it down just saying yeah well let me finish that let's say the results of not having the rash guard imp or impedes or gets in the way of your functionality or something like this you know you know how like like some people who wear straps or they'll wear I don't know what it it well we see it all the time now is with businesses because guess what there's no business that's stand on the worship center is very few that are completely vertically integrated businesses I mean like an origin right we don't we we're pretty vertically integrated but guess what we don't grow the cotton like we don't do that we don't grow cotton but guess what we have a good relationship with the people that grow cotton we have a good relationship with the people at stain the cotton or sorry die the cotton so we build those relationships with those other people now I work with businesses where there's a supplier that they don't like so guess what they form a hostile relationship with this whole company a whole company what could does that do them it doesn't do them any good at all what it means is they have no personal relationships they they form that antagonistic relationship with a whole other organization and it's almost impossible to overcome so now this is something where if you don't explain that culture throughout your team they're going to treat that other team horribly and so if you're waiting on supplies if you're on a construction site and you're waiting for materials to be delivered and you don't have a good relationship with the people that deliver the drywall and now the drywall's run late for whatever reason and you call you you fly off the handle or whatever you're you're not going to get that drywall any earlier it's not happening heavy ever and you actually right show you guys who can you shoulder you know just varying levels of shoulder flexibility and then that also goes for like the pain tolerance as well knees last way less from from a wide bill perspective there's so much to to learn I mean it's you know and the more I train the more I realize how little I actually know and how much more there is that I mean why I would I would I would I would rather focus on you know on the more the more foundational aspects of the game and until I can get those a little bit better I think that makes a lot of sense to me I think you might be the bull white belt right now of the world so in the in the navy the ensin which is the lowest ranking ensin at a ship or a seal team he gets called the bull ensin which means he's been the junior guy for the longest amount of time and you've been trained she's your footer quite some would you well you start training with me in 2005 and if you'd have a linen on us being able to learn how to use a radio I mean that could have cost lives right there another verse around comes to the roof wall are we take a main gun round now you're talking the the cannon on the tank the 120 millimeter main gun round you know just smash through both sides of walls you know it would it would have been absolute catastrophic those guys think you know they're under attack they're shooting back at what they think is enemy that didn't realize it and it's not like they were they were not ready to use those main gun rounds if they had to they were they were putting some buildings down over there for sure and that's and that's the hard part right is that you've got to hold a line and there's standards that can't be compromised and you've got to you're failing your team and your fan is a leader if you're not keeping those standards uh high and making sure the team achieves them and yet also you can't be the unrelenting task master the slave driver that just smash his people down is this shut up and do it a take but it doesn't mean that leaders can get angry lose their temper or be aggressive toward their people a leader must always deal professionally with subordinates on the team peers leaders up the chain of command customers or clients and personnel and supporting roles outside the immediate team speaking angrily to others is ineffective losing your temper is a sign of weakness the aggression that wins on the battlefield in business or in life is directed not toward people but toward solving problems achieving goals and accomplishing the mission it is also critical to balance aggression with careful thought and analysis to make sure that risks have been assessed and mitigated the dichotomy with the default aggressive mindset is that sometimes hesitation allows a leader to further understand a situation so that he or she can react properly to it rather than immediately respond to enemy fire sometimes the prudent decision is to wait and see how it develops is it a simple reconnaissance by fire is it a faint by the enemy meant to distract from the real attack is the enemy simply trying to lure you into a confined area where they have a superior force waiting to ambush a careful moment of consideration might reveal the enemies true intentions to be overly aggressive without critical thinking is to be reckless that can lead the team into a disaster and put the greater mission in peril to disregard prudent counsel when someone with experience urges caution to dismiss significant threats or to fail to plan for likely contingencies is foolhardy it is bad leadership a chief contributing factor to recklessness comes from what military historians have long referred to as the disease of victory this disease takes place when a few battlefield successes producing overconfidence in a team's own tactical prowess while underestimating the capabilities of its enemy or competitor this is a problem not just for combat leaders but for leaders and teams anywhere in any arena throughout the business world and the civilian sector it is a leaders duty to fight against this disease so that the team despite its success never gets complacent the risking any action must be carefully weighed against the potential rewards of mission success and of course to counter that thought the cost of inaction must be weighed as well as aggressive as leaders must be leaders must be cautious that they are not running to their deaths simply because it is their instinct to take action that I caught a me between aggression and caution must be balanced so be aggressive but never reckless so there's a principle principle laid out and then of course it's followed up with a business example of which there are manifold of businesses where the business gets too aggressive they start getting properties to put more stores into and they build up all this rent that they got to pay every month the next thing you know they have a down month and I think I think we covered that pretty well in sort of in the intro of the book and just a couple paragraphs and you should hit that part that we talked about earlier where it just kind of gives the overall the overall view or the the high level view of the topic of the book every behavior or characteristic carried out by a leader can be taken too far leaders can become too extreme and upset the balance required to effectively lead a team when balance is lost leadership suffers and the teens performance rapidly declines even the fundamental principles of combat leadership and extreme ownership can get out of balance a leader can cover and move too much and step on the toes of other leaders departments or divisions a plan can be too simple and failed to cover likely the contingencies a team could go too far with prioritizing execute resulting in target fixation and loss of situational awareness on newly emerging problems and threats even destabilize command can be taken too far when too much autonomy is given to support leaders who then don't fully understand strategic goals and how to execute and support those goals and this idea continues on but just about everything a leader does leaders must be close with their people but not too close that it becomes a problem they must hold the line with discipline but they must not become tyrannical a leader can even become too extreme with extreme ownership when a leader takes so much ownership of everything in his or her world that members of the team feel there's nothing left for which they can take ownership when this happens team members will execute only at the boss's specific direction without any route ownership or buy in themselves resulting in a team far less capable of overcoming obstacles and accomplish in the mission therefore balance and leadership is crucial to victory you can't say that one enough and you literally can't say that one enough I would think so when you have the same word to many time on times on a page it's it's not good writing and they don't know when to stop they get reckless they get careless they go too hard and so going back to the book here problems aren't going to solve themselves a leader must get aggressive and take action to solve the problems and implement a solution being too passive and waiting for a solution to appear often enables the problem to escalate and get out of control the enemy isn't going to back off the leader must get aggressive and put the enemy in check the good deal isn't going to deliver itself to a company the leader has to go out and make a good deal happen changes and new methodologies in a team are going to implement themselves leaders need to aggressively implement them and aggressive mindset should be the default setting of any leader default aggressive this means that the best leaders the best teams don't wait to act instead understanding the strategic vision or commanders intent they aggressively execute to overcome obstacles capitalize on immediate opportunities accomplish the mission and win rather than passively waiting to be told what to do default aggressive leaders proactively seek out ways to further the strategic mission they understand the commanders intent and where they have authority to do so they execute for decisions that are beyond their pay grade or above their authority default aggressive leaders still make a recommendation of the chain of command to solve problems and execute key tasks to achieve strategic victory in seal platoons and task units we expect this from leaders at every level right down to the front line trooper in charge of just himself and his small piece of the mission but this mentality is crucial to any leader in any team or organization it is just as critical to success in business as on the battlefield aggressive means proactive I find meetings of greater than or equal to eight people far less productive than smaller groups even with structured action oriented agenda is there a maximum amount of people you'd involve in a strategic or tactical planning group I don't think I don't think there is a maximum amount I think it just has to be controlled and you've got to have you've got to have some decentralized command or people understand if there's just a bunch of people that meeting and everyone's kind of speaking in turn and talking over each other you're not going to get anything done so you got to have there's got to be one leader who's run that there's got to be some some you know some other subordinate leaders that and one person has got to drive that meeting and make sure that when someone starts going in down a rabbit hole but you know we're joking about it but in the same time that we're joking about it the fact that like you brought that echo that up is a real thing and for us to be sitting here joking about it means that we actually think about it we actually every time you know you know laves making it a joke and excuse like oh juggling he's it's like we all know yeah check all right speaking of well like a speaking of combat sports next question six this is your jitz of question should instructors not teach white belts aka lathe babbin david berk and jp to nail that's cold blood it's a good deal to you that is good deal to you they should instructors not teach white belts certain techniques or should why they shouldn't do them be explained but still expose the white belts to techniques set the white belts recognize them so there's some techniques that you don't get taught very often as a white belt for instance a heel look I believe that it is good to not teach people a teach white belts to do heel hooks because the for example heel hooks can be very dangerous the reason that they're dangerous because they don't hurt a lot before they injure you and so white belts who are by nature completely insane and going crazy and going nuts and so when they get a hold of something they just go as hard as they can and by the way they're usually going against the white belt that's the only reason they're getting anything on them because they're going against white belt and that other white belt's going completely insane and he's not going to tap okay i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to distance a little bit but the the isolation you should never be isolated i think that's one thing that you know i remember coming into your office and uh i'm coming in hang out all the time in your office you know you you you come in hang out in the between space i mean i've come you know we we'd see each other in the gym we're like we're always trying to find a way to like hang out and talk and I know we talked about it really to be like when I would say something on the radio and task unit bruiser when I would say like a legitimate thing man it would happen if I got on and said everyone get the building 34 now people would go and one of my favorite things to do one of my favorite conversations to have on the radio with with either you or stoner was like I remember you'd be like you'd say hey Jocco we got another mover where I want to take down building 34 well we'll try to avoid that try to do it by just saying hey on this podcast go there and subscribe to it that way you won't get bothered with a little thing from echo at the end that says please click subscribe to watch more videos from echo child i still hear let's put it this way the most the most i'll show you say accurate for like a better term way to put it if you didn't know that we have a youtube channel we do if you didn't know you could subscribe to it boom now you do if you want to subscribe you can but that goes without saying obviously same thing with the like i like it that's a youtube that's you too grab to it we got a permanent excuse now whether wasn't good c's were too big when was too high cloud cover was too low whatever the case maybe you got a permanent excuse now because you can't control the weather actually wrong wrong we they control the weather we we will set up our missions we will set up our contingencies that no matter what the weather does where you do a conference the mission no matter what our big whatever wouldn't no matter what the big platform that we rely on no matter what happens with them we're gonna be in control that's how we roll get some that feedback was phenomenal and here you know saying that his client was like I've never seen anyone handle a problem I guess before you guys have done an amazing job and it's it's another example of how you're you're scared to take ownership and yet by taking ownership you're building trust you're building trust and you win it when when you take ownership and you actually get the problem solve going for speaking of ownership and taking ownership maybe I could take ownership you know it just it just stands out so obvious that someone is you know they're trying to cover move by helping another department and yet they're stepping on people's toes and they're pissing people off and you know like why are you you're trying to do my job and make me look bad and they get there like well I'm trying to cover move just like you don't me but it does kind of give you this kind of underlying feeling of like you're asking me to do something that's made to be organic it's made to be if you like this video you press like that's what that thing is made for and now you're asking me to violate that whole reason that it's made so you want me to do it like favor like you like I was watching your video because I thought we were and and you know for you could just put it perspective for me like it's very black and why not like no if you're not if you're not holding the line on these things that are important and pushing your team to perform with the highest standard or make it sure they're not going to do something it's going to get them in trouble or cause massive issues not only for us but for the entire you know not on for our unit but the entire seal teams then then that's you're failing them as a leader you you've got to hold the line on that stuff you've got to and and it is very liberating to say oh check and I haven't seen yet you know what I'm not planning for so it is very very difficult to balance this is a leader but you absolutely have to balance that you have to be aggressive you have to maneuver you know so many people get you know the the paralysis to analysis you know people talk about don't want to make it make a decision until you know the solution is right there I insisted on doing things a certain way because it was my way or harped on trivial matters that were strategically unimportant thinking I was doing right by holding the line it caused unnecessary friction stifled growth and inhibited junior leaders on the team from stepping up it prevented us from functioning properly with effective decentralized command I had seen and worked for numerous leaders throughout my navy career who had been overbearing and it wasn't the way I wanted to lead some of them imposed harsh discipline screened at their people and crushed them morale of the team no one wanted to follow them they might accomplish an immediate task but in the long run the team's growth was smothered often their negative example stood starkly in my mind I never want to be a leader like that there you go the tyrannical leader that's run around screaming at everyone and and like you just said they'll get some little tasks accomplished and they actually think that what's horrible is they get some little task accomplished because they screamed in yelled but we are as it's marron we are we are joking laughing about that this is the relationship juggle had you know not only with me but with with with other leaders in the task unit and uh and i think you have to have that i mean you you've got to have a you've got to have a relationship with your people um you can't think that i can't talk to anyone i can't interact with anyone i think this you're gonna be unsuccessful leader um you know if if uh you try to roll that way it's just not gonna work you know great person who wanted to dominate the universe and and make things happen love extreme ownership and yet is is struggling to see that because they think they're leading like you would lead they look at they look at a picture jockel like this is what jockel would do it's just crush everyone and tell them to do it because I said and and as you've explained it doesn't work it doesn't work that way it's never effective and that's why that's why I'm proud of this book and I think it'd be so useful to leaders to see you can't do that if you do that you're not ever going to be a success was you could be if you actually get the team on board explain why to them and and tie that to the bigger purpose of of what you're trying to accomplish in the world no there's a reason and he'll explain that to me later and if it was something where he's like I want to you know start doing jumping jacks out here then I might ask why because that doesn't make my sense to me but to say hey we're hitting building 34 as well what if we were doing burpees with that make more sense that makes a little more sense little more sense than jumping jacks look that that actually worked it worked for us when you when you said some of the radio like got it we're good like it the decision made everyone's on board i think it's this to me sounds like uh i was thinking about this question and it sounds to me like uh maybe a junior leader that was promoted at the chain because that's where you really feel like when i go from you know the assistant buto commander where i'm like kind of one of the boys I'm just trying to help you and then you're saying well you have to be careful about that you have to balance it so once you know it is the absolute most common problem we see all the time and even for you know folks that have read extreme ownership you know three or four you know multiple times that that are really trying hard to be better leaders they struggle with that and this is something to help them and help leaders everywhere and you know but you had a good one just a couple paragraphs on 84 about your kind of a stereotypical fire up extreme ownership boss that's going to come in there and make stuff happen I thought this was a good one go I've read a lot about patent the executive vice president said with pride referring to general George S. Paton Jr the famous U.S. Army general who's exploits in World War II were legendary I love that you reference patent in your presentation I want exactly the kind of discipline organization around here that patent expected we need people who carry out orders not question them I could tell right away that the executive vice president had no previous military experience he clearly misunderstood how effective leaders in the military led their teams it was not through rigid authoritarianism do this because I said so or you'll be punished sure there were those the military who tried to lead like that but it was never effective so there you go and also you know there is time where you've got to you've got to pick up the intensity in your voice so that people realize there's something important happening right there's just enough now you don't want to yell and scream and get all crazy but to be like hey I need vehicles here now like that is different but if they're looking at their phone or whatever then you're you're talking too much keep it short keep concise and people will listen to you more also that when you say you got to pay attention to yourself that's like a deep one it's like you just said it really simply like I just pay attention to yourself I mean you didn't say like that but it seems like as a consumer right that's it is an audience member of you or a video is whatever you and it does defeat the whole purpose of clicking like right when you like let me ask you how many people do you think get the end of a YouTube video or it says click subscribe now to watch more awesome videos how many people does that convince push them over the edge
