[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number 125 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening,
[00:00:07] I go. Good evening and we are bringing a Q&A today. Sure. To the world. First question.
[00:00:15] Dang right into it. Okay. All right. What is the difference between an excuse and a reason?
[00:00:22] Hmm. Kind of a good question, right? Sure. Okay. And the reason it's a good question
[00:00:33] because there can be legitimate reasons why things happen. Right? And so, for instance,
[00:00:41] you're in a sailing race, right? In a sailboat. And the mast snaps in half. Now you don't
[00:00:49] win the race. But I mean, you didn't, you know, the mast snapped. What can you do about that?
[00:00:56] Or the weather is horrible. Weather rolls in. You can't launch your aircraft so you can't
[00:01:00] go on your mission. You can't control the weather. So, you know, like, what's up? How
[00:01:05] can that? That's a reason. Or you get really sick. So, you can't compete in a competition.
[00:01:10] That's a reason. You know, you were sick. Oh, you do bad because you were sick in it. It's a
[00:01:16] reason. Could be called now. Now, you could look at the situation and say, okay, if I'm
[00:01:23] going to take ownership of this, did I properly test the mast? Did I? Let me ask you this.
[00:01:31] Did we have a ground-based plan for the operation in case the weather came in? We were
[00:01:36] going to take vehicles instead. Right? Yeah. That would work. If you get sick before the
[00:01:43] competition, maybe you ask yourself, were you resting properly? Were you eating properly,
[00:01:49] going into the competition? So you wouldn't get sick. You could address that, correct?
[00:01:55] Yes. So, you can still take ownership of things, even if the initial reaction is like,
[00:02:02] all of this, you can't control that. Well, that you can influence it. You can mitigate it.
[00:02:06] Right? Now, can there still be legitimate reasons? Yes, they're can. And for me,
[00:02:13] the difference, the line between an excuse and a reason is a reason you have zero control
[00:02:24] over. Right? You just have zero control over something happening? Well, that's a reason.
[00:02:30] Guy, tell you, I was almost late the other day. For something. No, because this is borderline.
[00:02:37] This is borderline. I had an appointment at 10 o'clock. I left him. Is it 20 minutes
[00:02:44] drive? I left an hour. I left at, well, I left about 9. 10. I left 50 minutes to drive 20
[00:02:54] minutes. Just so I'm going to make it on time. Yeah. I get on the road basically a couple
[00:03:00] roads out of my house and the one entry way to get on the freeway is lockdown. Lockdown.
[00:03:08] Like incident, like isolated some incident.
[00:03:12] Incident on a guy, a guy trying to kill himself on a bridge shot the road down. So no one's
[00:03:17] going on the highway. So what is it? Everyone's being channelized into marginal, what
[00:03:24] are they called back side streets? Yeah. Yeah. Reto is rerolled. Yeah. The clock is ticking. And
[00:03:32] and I made it, right? I made it. I was four minutes. I had four minutes to spare. So instead
[00:03:37] of it taking 20 minutes, it took whatever. 46 minutes. It took more than twice as long.
[00:03:44] That could be a fairly legitimate reason. Now, luckily, I had, I always, you know, I had
[00:03:55] planned that there could be something out of my control. It might take even longer. And
[00:03:59] that's why I leave early to go to unemployment or situation like that. So I could have
[00:04:06] also checked the traffic prior to leaving and taking a completely different route. That
[00:04:12] would have been, I blame myself. So even in that situation, I was thinking the whole time,
[00:04:17] why did I check the traffic before I left? I knew this could have happened. So anyways,
[00:04:24] in my opinion, an excuse is when you blame something that you could have controlled and
[00:04:29] a reason is something that you have absolutely no control over whatsoever. You think
[00:04:35] like a legit disease. I mean, sometimes people have, they just don't, you can't control
[00:04:39] that. It happens. But I think, and I think this is the important part. I think that what
[00:04:45] you will find, especially when you approach the world with an attitude of extreme ownership.
[00:04:52] And that's that you're not going to make any excuse. You're not going to blame it. And all
[00:04:54] it's, is that you actually have a lot more control over things than you think you do.
[00:05:00] So we've talked about this before. When I go to the airport, I get there really early,
[00:05:10] because it's something that you have no control over. You're going to stand in that TSA line,
[00:05:14] and those people are going to take forever. And that's the way it is. And if you want to get
[00:05:18] mad at them, you doesn't matter. You can't control. You cannot control it in any way. You can
[00:05:25] stand at the back of my flight, leaving in 30 minutes. And they'll be like, whatever,
[00:05:28] you should have shown up earlier. You can't control it. So in those situations, how do you control
[00:05:31] it? You show up early. You take ownership of it. You show up early. You don't just, I don't know what
[00:05:36] happened. The traffic was bad. I mean, it's just a million excuses. You can give. If you get that
[00:05:42] attitude where you're not going to make excuses, and you'll actually take ownership of the
[00:05:46] things. And then you'll actually solve problems before they even happen. If I'm going to an
[00:05:52] appointment, and I have the excuse in my back of my head that, you know what, if I'm late, I'll just
[00:05:55] say it was the traffic. I have much more increased chance of being late. All right. So what's,
[00:06:04] what that's, that's one of the things that makes extreme ownership hard is it hurt your ego.
[00:06:10] It hurts your ego. It hurts your ego to admit that you have control over things that went wrong. That's
[00:06:16] that they're, it's your fault that hurt your ego. It's also effective because of that. It's effective
[00:06:23] because you solve problems. Like I said before they even happen. You solve them because you take ownership of them.
[00:06:27] Yeah. But isn't this just a bunch of semantics, though, like excuses and reasons,
[00:06:35] because really when it comes down to it, excuses like in excuse, like you're excused. Like the
[00:06:42] reason is a reason for sure. But it's like, well, that's what this whole conversation. Yes, it is
[00:06:47] about semantics. And the semantics are for me, an excuse is something that you could have
[00:06:51] controlled and a reason is something that you could not control. Aren't they all reasons? So it's up to,
[00:06:56] I mean, again, you say tomato. I say to I get it. But come on, you brought it up. So,
[00:07:04] okay, so I remember when I went out and I went to school, you get, you come late to school.
[00:07:11] You get in trouble. Unless you have an excuse. Now, with it's, there's a difference between, and I'm
[00:07:19] saying in the, in the field, in class, right, you come, you come into class. If you have just your
[00:07:24] own excuse, like, oh, my, you know, dog ate it or I don't know, that's for homework. But whatever,
[00:07:30] that's different than if you have an excuse slip, which is an official slip, you know, your parents
[00:07:37] or whatever, you're also the office. Also, no, it's not your movement to get, excuse,
[00:07:41] slips change to reasons, slips. Right, right. Because that's what it's, it's a legitimate reason.
[00:07:45] Exactly. The kid had chicken pox can't come to school. You can't come. Yeah. You, there's nothing.
[00:07:50] You got chicken pox. That's what. That's what. That's how. Yeah. That's how. So, but now, given that,
[00:07:55] now, aren't we just talking about a very, like, a standard from case to case, so like, let's go back
[00:08:00] to school, but Brad bear with me. You want to get to the bottom of this. I'm telling you, if you,
[00:08:05] if you're barred by thread, if your parents had car trouble, right, is that an excuse for a
[00:08:13] nine year old? For a nine year old? Yeah. It is, it is a reason for a nine year old. So, that falls
[00:08:19] on the hierarchy of standards, but within the standards of being a quote unquote, legitimate
[00:08:27] excuse, right? Because that's really what it is. So, reason in your case, in your, yeah, a reason
[00:08:33] is language, language, language, language, and that's a reason as far as this question goes.
[00:08:37] Absolutely. In fact, I think I use the word legitimate in this, I was going to talk about it.
[00:08:42] Yeah. Yeah. And so, using the word reasons rather than excuse is just like, okay, let's make the
[00:08:47] language more simple rather than, because if you have an excuse, if you have an excuse, that's,
[00:08:53] it's that by its very nature by its very definition, you're excused. It's an excuse. You're excused
[00:08:58] from food for mean late or mean late to your, whatever, but if it's weird, because if someone
[00:09:05] else gives it to you, gives you the excuse. Like, you're excused. Hey, the guy was about to come
[00:09:09] at suicide, I get it, man. Your excuse kind of thing. It's like that's an excuse. In this case,
[00:09:15] a legitimate one. But if you give it to yourself, that's the excuse that nobody likes. All right?
[00:09:21] Like, hey, man, traffic all you should have prepared for that. Yeah.
[00:09:25] Hey, man, my, you know, whatever was going on in this and that, oh, man, you got to prepare for that.
[00:09:31] Do you seem saying? Yeah. I guess so. There you go. So reasons and
[00:09:36] legitimate excuses, same thing. Yeah, I'll give you that. You could have said that like four minutes.
[00:09:41] So there's no it. I'm just saying you'd have explained this thing because sometimes I
[00:09:46] hurt to understand. I'm telling you. No, see, the more you talked about it, the less I understand.
[00:09:51] I'm saying, said the last thing. I had to sum it up. Okay. The summary was great. I give you a
[00:09:56] big, a B plus on the summary. All right, thanks. I'll take it. Thank you. Yeah. Next question.
[00:10:01] Yes. Joko. Hindsight is 2020. But here's a crazy thought. North Korean soldiers would have
[00:10:11] ended up with a better life like South Korea. If they did not fight as they did in the 50s,
[00:10:17] when should a soldier question his leaders values? That is not a crazy question at all.
[00:10:24] And the answer is very straightforward. A soldier should always question their leaders. Not just
[00:10:29] their leaders values, but their leaders plans. Their leaders strategies. Their leaders vision.
[00:10:33] You should question everything that your leader is telling you. And if you see something is wrong,
[00:10:38] then you should raise your hand and call it out. And I would say not only is it something that you
[00:10:44] should do? It's actually your duty. It's actually your duty is to raise your hand as a soldier.
[00:10:51] And I'll tell you this doesn't only apply to the military. It applies to any organization.
[00:10:56] And it might sound like I'm encouraging mute knee or rebellion. But actually the opposite is true.
[00:11:06] If you have a team that questions the leader, the leader doesn't become weaker. The leader becomes
[00:11:13] stronger. If he's a good leader, if he's on the right path, if he's doing the right thing, he becomes stronger.
[00:11:16] Because everyone starts to understand why things are happening. They understand the vision more fully.
[00:11:21] If the leader doesn't have a good vision and he's getting question and he can't answer the
[00:11:26] question, yeah, he might have a mute knee on his hands. But it's not because the people are
[00:11:30] asking questions because he doesn't know what he's doing. So the leader can't see everything.
[00:11:38] And he can't solve every problem or have every idea. But the collective mind of an organization
[00:11:44] can make that happen. And that's why as a leader, if I'm in a leader's position, I want my
[00:11:49] subordinates to question me. I want them to question me. And like I said, if I don't have a good answer,
[00:11:54] I then need to find one. And if I can't find one, then maybe I'm actually doing something wrong.
[00:11:59] That's entirely possible. And now from a, if we want to talk about like a moral or an ethical
[00:12:07] perspective, then absolutely. And there was a group of high ranking soldiers in Nazi Germany,
[00:12:16] that tried to kill Hitler. And unfortunately, they failed. But they did the right thing and tried
[00:12:21] in trying to kill him. They did the right thing. Like not only did they question them,
[00:12:24] they knew he was wrong. And they said, okay, we're going to kill him.
[00:12:28] Now, do you put yourself at risk when you ask these questions? Because I'm sitting here saying,
[00:12:33] yeah, I want my subordinates to ask questions. There's people that don't want their subordinates
[00:12:37] to ask questions. Not good leader, not good leadership. That's not a good way to lead. I'm sorry.
[00:12:43] I'm telling you the truth. I mean, and so there's a risk. Because if your leader doesn't
[00:12:49] want you to ask questions and you raise your hands and ask a question and you do it an
[00:12:52] untapped for a way and you do it a way that offense, your leader, well, then you might end up
[00:12:57] getting fired or if you try and kill Hitler, you might get killed yourself because that's what
[00:13:02] Hitler did. After his assassination, he's happy he went and killed a bunch of people, including
[00:13:06] Robball, his best general. Because he thought he was involved in it. So you, you're definitely
[00:13:12] taking a risk, but then you have to ask yourself what is the alternative. So in a moral or ethical
[00:13:18] situation, what's the alternative? And I'm not saying there's no alternative. Because sometimes
[00:13:23] maybe you'd be better not trying to kill Hitler, but rise in the ranks and get to a situation
[00:13:28] where you can have more control and mitigate the damage that he's doing to the country. That's
[00:13:32] a possible consideration to take. Maybe you say, okay, you know what, Hitler, I'm going to be
[00:13:37] your guy and I'm going to, you know, I'm going to do things so that way you can rise up in the ranks
[00:13:42] and being a position where you can stop his bad decisions. As opposed to, if you try and kill him,
[00:13:48] you fail, you know, you mean, obviously, once you're dead, you don't have any influence over
[00:13:51] the organization. Same thing if you're in a business, whether something going on and you want to raise
[00:13:55] your hand. And yet if you raise your hand, you know that there's a risk that you might either
[00:14:01] ache, fired or you might get demoted or you might get put out of your leadership position. And
[00:14:06] now you're letting down, now you can't have an influence over the scenario anymore. So that's
[00:14:12] that's something to consider as well. It takes a significant level of moral courage to stand up
[00:14:20] in those situations. And you have to be tactful. I think that's important to say, you have to be
[00:14:28] tactful. You have to have, you don't walk in and just start questioning your leadership immediately.
[00:14:33] You have to build a relationship for us. First, you have to grow your trust between each other
[00:14:38] and then once you have that, you can then tactfully bring up questions and try and get
[00:14:47] to the bottom of why things are happening or why things are being done a certain way or another way.
[00:14:54] Question your leadership. And if you're a leader, don't get offended when you get questioned.
[00:14:58] Be happy. Be happy. Even when your kids do it. Even when your kids do it, especially when your
[00:15:06] kids do it. Yeah. Because you always want to take that easy out. Just do what I told you to do.
[00:15:10] Yeah, I do it. I said that. It's different than what I said. You caught yourself.
[00:15:15] Yeah, I played that for a day. Self policing over there. Outstanding.
[00:15:20] What about when they always add the kids? What they always say why. And then,
[00:15:28] you just think you gotta be careful. I'm speaking from experience. You know how, you know
[00:15:31] the whole, this is old school. Like, oh, why? Oh, because of this, why? Why? And then, it gets fun to
[00:15:37] them just to say why. They don't even want to know why it now. It just becomes a game. Then what
[00:15:41] just shut it right down. Well, that's when you should just keep, oh, it's me against you. No,
[00:15:45] no, just go to your to one of them. You ask why you asked them a question back.
[00:15:52] Why do you think it goes that way? And then, let's say, well, I don't know. Well, why? Why don't you know?
[00:15:57] Just one sweep. Yeah. Yeah. It's a sweep. Yeah. It's a good one. Yeah. It's a really good
[00:16:03] action. Speaking from experience, I got four kids.
[00:16:10] All right. Good. Thank you for that. Next question.
[00:16:13] Joko, you say, Jitsu makes you humble. Why do some Jitsu instructors and many Jitsu practitioners
[00:16:19] act like complete arrogant? Jers. Oh, yeah. That's a good one. That's a great question.
[00:16:26] And we haven't really talked about, have we talked about, I don't think we've talked about that.
[00:16:29] Now, I've talked about how some like, there's bad, there's bad apples in the Jitsu community
[00:16:36] for sure. But the way that the way that I talk about the Jitsu and the way we talk about it,
[00:16:41] like everybody that does Jitsu should be some Buddha like enlightened being at one with the universe.
[00:16:51] And totally free of any ego, because that's what we talk about, Jitsu. But
[00:16:58] like I said, I've talked about the fact that there's definitely bad people in Jitsu. And that's
[00:17:01] why you need to be careful when you're, you know, Jitsu should not be a cult. You, you should not
[00:17:08] be worshiping your instructor. Your instructor is a human being. There's been Jitsu people that
[00:17:13] have been wrapped up in all kinds of terrible stuff that every kind of crime you can imagine. So again,
[00:17:19] just like a person in the military, just like a seal, just like being in the seal teams doesn't
[00:17:24] make you a good person. It applies to everything else. Jitsu, just because you do,
[00:17:29] you do, you do, you do, you just because you're a black phone, you just doesn't make you a good person.
[00:17:32] Yeah, you, you, you, you're, you're a, you're a good person. There's plenty of
[00:17:42] malevolent people out there that wear the cloth of God, but actually practice the work of Satan.
[00:17:49] So you have to apply that rule to everything. And it's definitely the same with Jitsu. And Jitsu,
[00:17:56] Jitsu is a power. It's a position of power. When you're good at it, you have some power over
[00:18:00] other people and some people are going to abuse that power. If you have the right mindset,
[00:18:09] Jitsu is extremely humbling because you realize that what you realize when you do Jitsu is that you
[00:18:14] can be beat by other people. That's what you realize. And it, for the most part, as a broad
[00:18:21] generalization, if another human has been training longer than you, they can beat you. And this is
[00:18:28] especially in the beginning of Jitsu, right? Once you have, once you get further along, it's that gap
[00:18:33] closes up. But in general, if someone's been training six months and you've been training one,
[00:18:38] you're going to get beat. There's very few exceptions to that. If you've been training for a year
[00:18:43] and someone's been training for one month, you're going to beat that person that's been training
[00:18:46] for one month. That's just, and, and that covers a huge, that covers all kinds of weight classes and
[00:18:51] athletic ability and all that stuff. The great athlete total stud can, if you've been training
[00:18:56] for one month and you've got someone that's been training for a year, year and a half, it's going to be a problem.
[00:19:01] So, if you realize that when you start, that makes you humble. And if you remember that as you get
[00:19:12] better, it will keep you humble if you don't forget that. But what happens is sometimes people
[00:19:20] forget that it's Jitsu that gives them the power to submit other people and it's not their power.
[00:19:28] Right? It's not their power. They believe that they are the power of Jitsu. They think it's them.
[00:19:36] And so they think they're better than anyone else. And that's what that is. That's arrogance.
[00:19:40] That's what it is. And it's ugly. And I think really, if I was to drill down,
[00:19:45] I would say it's caused by people that are number one insecure. They're insecure. So,
[00:19:53] they just, they get this thing that they can dominate other people and they relish it. Or,
[00:20:00] you know, also, people that are just like not that smart. Right? They don't realize,
[00:20:07] they don't, they don't put two and two together. That like, oh, the reason I'm better,
[00:20:11] the reason I can choke this person is because I've been training longer than them. That doesn't
[00:20:17] make me a better human being. It just means I'm better at this one aspect of being a human being.
[00:20:23] So, I would say those are, yeah, those are some of the reasons. And if you end up at a school
[00:20:30] where people are arrogant, just don't train there. Go to different school. Yeah.
[00:20:34] It's like the only school option you have. And if it's getting in your way, I mean,
[00:20:39] because there's a different, let's face it like being arrogant is kind of strong. But,
[00:20:46] being not humble in these teeny tiny little ways, you run into that all the time. Just these
[00:20:50] small ways, you're still within the jujitsu community though. So, you know, this guy may always talk
[00:20:56] about how good his triangle choke is or something like this, you know, this stuff. And that's not
[00:21:00] to mention like, that's not offensive though. Yeah, exactly. Is it okay? No. Yeah, I'm not a fan
[00:21:04] of that. But I probably tell you, yeah, you do have a good. Yeah. But you know how guys will brag and,
[00:21:08] you know, be like, oh, it's not tournament or something like that. It doesn't scream humble.
[00:21:13] You know, it doesn't necessarily. So, maybe like that expectation, whatever. Okay. I think
[00:21:19] you kind of got to make a concession for those sorts of things. Yes. Absolutely. Like, you know,
[00:21:25] this is something I talk about. It's a dichotomy leadership, it's a dichotomy of the ego, right?
[00:21:29] You don't want to go to a school where no one cares if they went to lose it. You want to go to
[00:21:31] a school where, like, where, hey, when we train here, we're training to beat each other. Like we're
[00:21:35] training to win. Yeah. When you win, you're happy. There's ego on the map for sure. My ego's on the map.
[00:21:40] I don't want to lose it. Don't like to tap it. Don't, you know, it's a great. But I mean, at the same
[00:21:44] time, I love to tap because that means I'm learning. But you don't, so that's that's acceptable.
[00:21:49] Like that's, of course. Yeah, you want to train a place where there's competitiveness in the school.
[00:21:53] Yeah. But this is totally different. This is, you know, when you get people that are just
[00:21:56] arrogant, you're extremely, they're definitely out there. Most, I don't know, I don't know.
[00:22:01] What do I say most? That's the way it should be. They haven't learned to get too correctly.
[00:22:06] Yeah. That's not what your juts is meant to be. I think you're in my opinion. 100% rate when you
[00:22:10] say it's like an insecure person and not the kind of broken insecure. It's just, you know, like someone
[00:22:15] who's saying, just live in an insecure, you know, someone comes in, like, especially if you're in
[00:22:19] like a certain type of instructor and you're used to like everyone just listening to every word you
[00:22:24] say and then, I don't know, a student or someone comes with something different than what you said.
[00:22:30] Or the opposite of what you said or something that kind of indicates that what you said is
[00:22:34] 100% correct is like boom, you're going to defend that little position that you've kind of grown
[00:22:38] accustomed to, you know, especially if you're even a little bit insecure, you're going to at least
[00:22:42] have those feelings. So, and it's interesting how that even that this, due to it's who wants to get
[00:22:47] reflects leadership in life. If you get a guy, if you get an instructor that gets shown to move,
[00:22:52] but it's not his move and he gets mad about it, like your respect for the instructor goes down.
[00:22:56] It does go up. If you get a guy that goes, wow, that's awesome. Let me see that again. Let me
[00:23:00] learn that. Let me incorporate that in my game. That's a great thing. Thanks for showing me.
[00:23:03] Yeah. You're respect for that teacher goes up because you recognize that they're humble,
[00:23:07] that they're evolving, that they want to learn, that they have an open mind, which is what you want
[00:23:10] to see in your leaders and in your digital instructors. Boom. Yeah. So funny. Adam,
[00:23:15] amazing. Amazing. Coach Adam. Coach Adam. Yeah. So he, I came in one time. He's teaching this move.
[00:23:23] And he, you know, he teach really good. I was like, yeah, it's a good move, you know, and he's teaching it.
[00:23:29] And when he explained what this move was, it was a move that he just got beat with in a tournament
[00:23:35] that someone else did and obviously was really good. And to me that you're never the move.
[00:23:42] Yeah. Yeah. It was like, you're similar to the, remember back in the day Frank
[00:23:46] Mir got this guy named Pete, big tall guy, Pete. This old school UFC. Oh yeah. Yeah.
[00:23:52] Pete. Oh, this is maniac. Maniac. Maniac. Wasn't the maniac. The twist is on. Right. Is like an
[00:23:58] Americana in an arm lock position. Yeah. Overhook, you know, from the car. Yeah. It was kind of like
[00:24:02] that, but it was a straight arm lock. Yeah. And the guy's name was Philippe. Oh, really? Wasn't
[00:24:07] it to himself, yeah. No, it was old. And the UFC was, it was Frank Mir did it to Pete. I think
[00:24:14] the name is Pete. He was a San Diego that actually. Oh, okay. He was old. I thought it was to have. I thought
[00:24:18] it was to have. No, Tim Sylvia's, he broke his arm and it's shallow arm bar. Oh, that, you might be
[00:24:23] thinking about that. But nonetheless, when Adam got hit with it in the tournament, it was against
[00:24:29] getting fully, Gracie Bogger. Anyway. So to me, when Adam decides to teach that move, that was like the
[00:24:37] opposite of what this arrogance is. It's not like, oh, it make a bunch of excuses and dismiss it
[00:24:42] because I'm dope. You know, and that was just so, you know, once in a lifetime, he was like, man,
[00:24:46] this is a legitimate move. They worked on me by the way. And that's not to mention getting over the
[00:24:53] fact that you lost an tournament and then now you're going to kind of revisit the whole situation by
[00:24:58] glorifying the move, kind of thing. So that's like the ultimate in humility, my opinion. There you go.
[00:25:03] But it makes sense. I mean, not to say it's good or it's like an exuser or it's fine or not or even
[00:25:08] acceptable or whatever, but it does make sense though, even like competitors, you know, like,
[00:25:12] I got it. He said practitioners, but maybe competitors or whatever were, you know, you have the
[00:25:16] competitive aspect of it. And so you're going to talk a high game about your jiu-jitsu, you know,
[00:25:21] that's kind of hot is or whatever. To be an arrogant jerk though, that, that, that, I think that's
[00:25:27] like something that the human being brought into jiu-jitsu, you know, and then the jiu-jitsu kind of just
[00:25:32] mixed it, you know, mixed it. That's what I think. There's what I think is what it seems like anyway,
[00:25:37] but I think for the most part, when you start jiu-jitsu, it makes you more humble than you were before,
[00:25:42] 100% because of that reason. It really should. And if it doesn't, you're wrong. Yeah.
[00:25:48] Even, I mean, it's hard. It's hard to imagine how it wouldn't even like in an exceptional.
[00:25:54] No, it's because when people start to get good at it and then they forget what it was like,
[00:25:58] yes, that's true. That's true. That's true. That's what happens. And then it comes biting you one day.
[00:26:03] You know, you know, you know what, but it's, these guys in here's the thing, when you've been in the
[00:26:07] game long enough, you see this super clear too, right? So let's say you get this, I don't know, this,
[00:26:11] this is a straw man, by the way. So you get this guy, he gets humble, right? He starts to just
[00:26:17] see you get humble. He gets good at you. Just do good at moves. He's tapping everybody out. Now he's
[00:26:20] in arrogant jerk. Now when these other big dogs start coming in, he avoids rolling with
[00:26:25] the other one. If you doesn't roll with the higher belt, he doesn't compete. Nothing like that.
[00:26:30] He only rolls with the lower belt. He's the same. You can do that. But here's the thing when people do that.
[00:26:35] It's so obvious. So obvious. Man, I remember when I started you to and this was like a few,
[00:26:41] like a year or two years in, I remember being kind of apprehensive, not apprehensive, kind of scared,
[00:26:46] actually in Endless working at the club where you kind of walk around and, you know, in the
[00:26:51] that club situation, it's that you can't know if it can be like, you don't know if this guy knows
[00:26:55] you're exactly men and where he, where it's like man, I got his humble. Yes, 100% and man, if there's
[00:27:01] not even a little bit of that in your head, it's like man, something must be weird. Because even
[00:27:05] me, I walk around like, hey, I'm pretty good at just you, but there may be somebody out there that's
[00:27:09] better. Yeah. I mean, what are you going to do? So be careful, he run your mouth too. How's that?
[00:27:14] How much tree people respect? How's that? Sounds like a good idea, man. And that's the result of being
[00:27:18] humble, then humility in general. Man, I think about it though, in the night club, like everyone's
[00:27:24] crunchesize you in each other up and it's kind of this thing, that's the climate. And also what
[00:27:27] it feels like, man, I remember thinking like this skinny guy right here, especially a tall skinny guy,
[00:27:33] who in, if you didn't know about you, just a tall skinny guy, there's one other than a non-fact,
[00:27:38] they're kind of thing. But now it's like, man, if you get caught in a arm bar, a choke in on the,
[00:27:43] you know, on the streets, so to speak, right here in big trouble. Huge trouble. Stay humble. Stay humble.
[00:27:52] But yes, that's the explanation I agree with you 100%. Next question. Next question.
[00:27:57] Next question. Well, let's talk about you do some more, some more because I could, if you want,
[00:28:02] we could, you could, at least in. Next question, when you grow in size in an organization,
[00:28:09] do you have to change the principles of combat leadership from extreme ownership or adopt new ones?
[00:28:18] No. Oh, wait, so I, but I asked this kind of, we, and I, you know,
[00:28:23] like, do you have to do any, either either of these, right? That's kind of the, the question.
[00:28:28] Do you have to change the principles or adopt new ones? Do you have to do that? No, the answer is no.
[00:28:35] As a matter of fact, when your organization gets bigger, the only change you have to make is
[00:28:41] to get better at the laws of combat. That's what you have to do. So, as you grow,
[00:28:48] you have to work harder to build relationships with other divisions so that you can cover
[00:28:51] and move for each other, right? That's, that's, that's a given. You have to get better at keeping
[00:28:56] things simple because the message has to be spread to more people. So word has to be spread
[00:29:02] that is simple clear and concise. That makes sense. You have to learn how to prioritize an
[00:29:07] execute better because there's a larger group of people that have to shift their focus on
[00:29:14] whatever priorities coming out. It's that you have a bigger ship to turn.
[00:29:19] And you have to do this accurately and quickly and there's less room for error in shifting
[00:29:23] priorities when you have a bigger organization. And of course, for decentralized command,
[00:29:27] you have to get better to that because in a small organization, it's pretty easy, right? You don't
[00:29:34] really, you don't really have to do decentralized command. If you've got five people working for you,
[00:29:39] you can actually just control. You don't really have to use decentralized command. It's a place to
[00:29:43] begin it and instill that culture, but you can get away without it because you can actually,
[00:29:50] you can actually watch everyone. You can direct everyone. You can influence everyone and you
[00:29:54] can actually lead them directly when you're in a small organization. So you don't have to be all
[00:29:58] that great at decentralized command. But as you get bigger, you just can't do that anymore.
[00:30:03] So the only way to watch everyone and direct everyone and influence everyone and lead everyone,
[00:30:09] the only way to do that is through your subordinate leadership is through decentralized command.
[00:30:14] So you have to be better at that. Now, I will say that the one thing that you may be have to
[00:30:21] adjust, it's not really a principle, but you are going to have to look at your communication
[00:30:28] methods. You're going to have to look at your communication methods. You just aren't going to be
[00:30:33] able to meet with everyone face to face anymore. You don't have time when you're organizing,
[00:30:37] when your organization gets big enough, you won't. There'll be employees there and subordinate
[00:30:42] leaders that you'll never see. Maybe some, you know, some that you've never been on a call with.
[00:30:47] So how do you get the message? How do you get the mission all the way through the organization?
[00:30:53] We have to do with decentralized command, but how do you communicate it? And my thing is always like you
[00:30:58] have to communicate in every available method and the bigger you get. The more the larger your
[00:31:04] organization is, you have to take advantage of everything, you have to take advantage of calls of emails,
[00:31:08] of meetings, of physical documents that you know, you put out and say, have you read this and
[00:31:14] you make videos? I'm making that recommendation a lot now to big larger organizations that I work with
[00:31:19] is wider, you know, I'll ask them how often are you having an all hands-type meeting? Well,
[00:31:25] it's really hard because you can't really get face to face to everyone because we've got
[00:31:28] multiple different, not only multiple different areas, but we got multiple different times on
[00:31:31] so if we want, you know, you got someone on the other side of the ocean,
[00:31:34] hey, we're going to have a meeting at a reasonable time. It's impossible to have everyone at a reasonable
[00:31:38] time. So what do you do? Okay, eventually it's okay. Well, why don't you make videos?
[00:31:42] Make it make a, make a four minute video that everyone can see and understand and see where the
[00:31:46] vision's going. So all these, every different communication methods that you can hit all the different
[00:31:51] types of people because there's some people that like to read emails. There's something that won't
[00:31:55] watch a video, but they'll read a email, they'll read a document. There's some people that will not
[00:32:00] sit in a conference call, but they'll go through the notes that get sent out a bridge notes.
[00:32:05] So there's all kinds of ways to communicate in my advice is to use them all, but the fundamental
[00:32:11] principles of leadership itself don't change. So don't just stick to them, actually get better and
[00:32:17] pay more attention to them. Check. Decentralized, command. That seems like the one, but actually
[00:32:25] know what now that you kind of explain it. They'll seem pretty important. Well, they are all important
[00:32:32] and there's, and they are, it's interesting. They're, they're actually in order. What they're actually
[00:32:40] in order, well, they're in order the way we wrote them in the middle of the way I originally talked
[00:32:43] about them. It's like the number one cover move. If you're not doing that steam work, if you're not doing
[00:32:46] that, you're not going to do anything. Number two is you got to keep things simple. Like you have to do that
[00:32:52] because you can't cover move for someone else if you don't even understand what's going on.
[00:32:54] So it's got to be simple. And then prioritize next to you. Well, there's going to be things that
[00:32:58] are changed, things that are dynamic. And so the next thing you've got to worry about is like when
[00:33:01] things change, how are you going to prioritize what's changing, how are you going to handle these problems?
[00:33:06] But then the last one is decentralized command, which is now that you've got those other four
[00:33:12] kind of stable. Now you can start really leading properly. But for your, to your credit, if you flip
[00:33:20] those upside down, in order of sort of broad organizational importance decentralized command is the
[00:33:27] most important. One, now you're not going to have it without the other three. Prioritized next
[00:33:32] cute is the next important one from an organizational perspective. Keeping things simple is
[00:33:36] then the next one. And so if you flip them upside down as an organization, the level of importance
[00:33:41] inside the organization is reversed, but the way that you have to implement them. And the, and you,
[00:33:48] the bottom lines, you'll never get to decentralized command if you can't keep things simple.
[00:33:51] We don't come in. So you can't get there. But in order to build them, so in order to build them,
[00:33:56] you have to kind of use in order. But then when you look at them, when you look at them from the
[00:34:00] importance of how well they make a team function. Again, if you can't cover and move it all or you
[00:34:07] can't keep things simple, you'll never get to decentralized command. But you have someone that's
[00:34:10] working them all and they're all doing well. Well, then the most important one is decentralized command.
[00:34:14] decentralized command is the one that takes you the highest level. Right. It'll have the most impact
[00:34:18] on your organization. You'll never get there without the other three. But once you have those three
[00:34:23] and you, you implement decentralized command, you'll be absolutely that'll be the most powerful
[00:34:27] thing in your organization. You can't do without the other three. It's the strongest, but it's
[00:34:31] doesn't matter without the other three. Yeah. Just check. That's a question.
[00:34:38] Joko, how does your quote unquote play the game? Play the games in terms of completing the goal
[00:34:46] fit in with Jordan Peterson's agreeableness in terms of career advancement. Is it a case of
[00:34:53] right time right agreeableness? So this comes from Jordan Peterson talking about how people that
[00:35:00] are more agreeable have less success in promotion and salary than someone that is more assertive.
[00:35:11] So it's a really good question because this person is taking what I talk about, which is play the
[00:35:17] game. And thinking that that means agreeableness and it does to some extent. It absolutely does to some
[00:35:24] extent. And so that's a really good question. And the answer is that there's a dichotomy to this,
[00:35:31] that they're like like all of life and like all of business and like all of leadership. There's
[00:35:36] dichotomy because while while someone that is agreeable, like like very agreeable, certainly
[00:35:43] has less of a chance of career advancement than someone that is assertive. Right? That makes sense. Like
[00:35:49] if you never say, hey, I'll do that or hey, let me handle that project. If you don't ever do that,
[00:35:54] and someone says, hey, no, I'll do this. And you go, okay, that's fine. And we're going to promote
[00:35:58] this guy. Oh, okay, that's fine. You know, if you're that agreeable, well, yeah, it's going to be problematic.
[00:36:02] But also, when in when assertiveness turns into overly aggressive, the chances of advancement start
[00:36:08] to go back down again and when you take someone that's when you get to someone that is ultra aggressive
[00:36:13] and rubbs people the wrong way and won't do any compromising, that person's going to be at the same
[00:36:18] person, the same level of this advancement is someone that's super agreeable or at least in the same
[00:36:22] ballpark, they'll be close if they still have a job at all, by the way, because someone that's,
[00:36:27] you know, overly aggressive and won't compromise with anyone and calls everyone out.
[00:36:31] The, if they're the complete far end of the spectrum opposite to agreeable,
[00:36:36] that's going to be a problem. So, so when I talk about playing the game, I'm, I'm definitely
[00:36:41] talking about being agreeable because I'm telling you to be more agreeable, right? When you don't
[00:36:45] play the game, it's like, hey, we're going to think this, we're going to run this new project. That's
[00:36:49] project is stupid. Mm-hmm. Well, an agreeable person would say, okay, well, that sounds good,
[00:36:54] where we go with this. Now, an agreeable person that's too agreeable might go down the road of
[00:36:59] something that's not a good plan. But if you're overly aggressive, if you're not playing the
[00:37:03] great game at all, you're not going to get past go, right? So, when I say play the game,
[00:37:11] I am talking about being a girl now, talking to someone the other day who's pretty hardcore
[00:37:15] and he was feeling some heat from his boss in the company that I was working with and he wanted
[00:37:19] to fight back, wanted to fight back, hashtag recessed. And you want to fight back, you want to go beyond
[00:37:29] resist, you want to go like into the aggressive mode. And I told him, don't fight back, I said,
[00:37:35] play the game. And he sort of got aggressive because he said he's pretty hardcore guy, he started
[00:37:39] getting aggressive with me and saying, oh, that's what I should do now bow down, it gets the ring.
[00:37:46] I'm not going to do that. I'm a man, right? It came at me with that, with that angle. And then he said,
[00:37:51] this, which was interesting. He goes, you know, he said something along once, but you would take this kind
[00:37:57] of crap, why should I? And I stayed quiet for a minute. I heard him say that, and I was like, oh,
[00:38:03] you just serve me up all soft. And then, you know, I took a big breath and I'm like, you have no idea.
[00:38:12] You have no idea the things that I have done, the pride that I have swallowed, the dumb jokes.
[00:38:19] I've laughed at the idiotic plans of supported the insane lengths that I had to go through
[00:38:25] out my career, my entire career to win, to win in the end. That was my goal. And in order to win,
[00:38:34] you kind of play the game. You got to massage some egos. You have to accept some things that you
[00:38:40] normally might not accept. You have to eat some humble pie some from time to time and what you're
[00:38:46] doing and why you do those things is so that you can build, so that you can build confidence with
[00:38:51] your boss. That's what you're doing. So you can build trust with your boss. And you do that.
[00:38:58] So that in the end, if your boss is not a good guy, you can actually beat the boss. You can win.
[00:39:06] But you can't win if you don't play the game. You'll lose before you even start. So play the
[00:39:09] game. That's what I told this guy. Right? Now, can you do you have the balance this? Yes, you absolutely
[00:39:16] do because if you become a sick event and you just become a brown noseer, am I talking about
[00:39:22] becoming a brown noseer? No. Because if you do that, you're losing clouds and influence with your
[00:39:28] with your team or with your subordinates or with your peers because you're brown noseing the boss
[00:39:33] and you're losing cloud there. So you have to, and you won't win because those guys are going to
[00:39:39] get past it to you. They're not going to support you. So I'm not saying you go overboard. You have to
[00:39:46] have balance. You have to know when to say yes, when to a piece. I built so much cloud. I built cloud
[00:39:55] by doing things that people wanted me to do that. Maybe I was kind of a weird project or they
[00:40:00] want me to try some piece of equipment. It's like cool. Yeah, I'll try it. We'll write you a
[00:40:03] good report about it. You know what I mean? Like, oh yeah, you want me to try some new tack.
[00:40:07] Cool. We'll give you a try. In my mind, I'm thinking this is dumb. But you know what?
[00:40:10] Hey, let's give it a try. Oh, you know what? We didn't work as well as I was hoping it would.
[00:40:14] But you know, here's some points. We took away from it. Okay. The guy at least said as opposed to saying
[00:40:18] that new tactic is stupid. Your plan is dumb. Okay. I'm disagreeable. What's that going to get me?
[00:40:27] It's not going to get. I'm being too assertive. I'm being too aggressive. So you have to,
[00:40:33] you have to balance it. You have to know when to tactfully stand up and disagree with someone
[00:40:38] instead of being totally agreeable all the time. I'm not talking about being agreeable all the time.
[00:40:42] I'm talking about balance. I sort of'm talking about and that's playing the game.
[00:40:47] So playing the game is not being a submissive agreeable. Baby, right? That's not playing the game.
[00:41:00] Playing the game is playing balance is knowing when is building trust. It's doing some dumb things,
[00:41:06] showing respect and just playing the game. And you're playing the game to win. That's what you're
[00:41:11] playing the game for. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I get it. You know, playing the game, you know,
[00:41:18] maybe got viewed as like being agreeable. But when Jordan Peterson talks about agreeableness,
[00:41:25] he's talking about a personality trait. He's not talking about some action you took to do something.
[00:41:29] Oh, yeah. But agreeableness has resulting actions if you're an agreeable person. Yeah.
[00:41:34] Yeah. But when it comes when it stems from a personality trait, that means just like I
[00:41:38] you said, like you're going to be agreeable for the most part regardless. Like I forget what the
[00:41:44] the other trait was is called about, you know, success when you're talking about that. But
[00:41:48] nonetheless, like if you're talking about playing the game, meaning sure you might have to
[00:41:52] display some agreeableness everyone's in a while to kind of size it when you have to or when you
[00:41:57] you know, when it's useful. That does not mean you're an agreeable person as a personality trait. That's
[00:42:01] true. Way too different completely different thing. I'm definitely not. I'm definitely not
[00:42:06] saying that you're going to be able to train your change your personality. Yeah. Because I'm not a
[00:42:10] very agreeable person. I agree with people all day long. Right. Why? Because I'm trying to win.
[00:42:14] That's the point exactly. Right. I actually disagree with 89% of the things that I hear on a daily basis.
[00:42:20] You know what I mean? I'm literally trying to figure out right now as I'm thinking about this.
[00:42:24] So many things I disagree with. There's two things that are going on. Number one, this is this is
[00:42:29] straight up. Number one, if you give me an idea. And I go, that's dumb echo. Number one, I'm
[00:42:36] arrogant. I'm not listening. I'm I'm shutting the idea out. When your idea might have some good
[00:42:41] traits to it. Number two, your pissed. Yeah. Right. I didn't gather any cloud with you. I didn't build
[00:42:47] our relationship at all. I just said like, hey, that's a dumb idea. No, so instead of me, okay, we'll tell
[00:42:51] me about it. Tell me, like, how would you, how would you implement this idea of yours? Because maybe
[00:42:57] it could have some good benefit. I could see where you're coming from on this. Yeah. Well, now I'm
[00:43:01] building our relationship and you're thinking that, hey, this guy listens to me and that's what I like
[00:43:06] and someone I work with. Someone that listens to me. So those are the kind of things that we're talking
[00:43:10] about. I'm not talking about changing your personality. I'm a disagreeable, I'm a disagreeable human being.
[00:43:16] But I don't show that very often. I don't, there's something I was talking about. I was talking
[00:43:20] about this. Who's I talking to? I forget what I was talking to, but I was talking about how
[00:43:25] I never, ever. Like, there's some things that really bothered me. Sure. In the world,
[00:43:29] I never tell anyone what they are. I will not. I'll go to the, maybe I'll put like in my last
[00:43:34] will-intestimate things that bothered me. But I will, but, but, but I don't tell anyone. Yeah.
[00:43:41] Why? Well, the main reason is because when you're in the teams and people know what
[00:43:45] I was going to get, they're going to tear you up with that thing. So you will never, I'll never
[00:43:49] say it. Well, tell my kids, don't tell my wife nothing. When something happens that really,
[00:43:53] really bothers me, because I'm disagreeable. I don't like that kind of stuff. Is it like pet
[00:43:58] peep kind of stuff? Or is- All right. Personality traits. I don't like the way people communicate
[00:44:03] sometimes. I don't like little pet peeves that I have of things that people do that I don't like.
[00:44:07] I don't, but no one knows any of them. No one knows that they're all deep undercover. And I will never
[00:44:12] tell anyone what they are. You want to, I feel like you should kind of tell me just so I avoid these
[00:44:15] things because I'm very, very, very, very well in that way. Yeah. I don't want to do that stuff. Like
[00:44:19] if I'm saying, you know, people say, I don't know, no one's saying, no one's saying, or like,
[00:44:25] if I say, like, I say, like, a lot, do you not like that? Is that one of the things? I'll never tell anyone.
[00:44:30] I'll never tell anyone. All right. What's these things are? Cool. You're the target list for you.
[00:44:38] It's not that big. I'm at low risk. I'm still on the radar. I know. I do. Yeah. Hey, everyone,
[00:44:45] play the game, play the game. I know it's everyone wants- Hey, that's the funny things. Everyone thinks
[00:44:50] like, Joc was a core. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, actually, I'm going to play the game.
[00:44:55] Because you know why I'm going to win. That's the difference. I'm going to win. Yeah. That was kind of
[00:44:58] part of your story too. When the guy was, was that a face-to-face thing when you're talking,
[00:45:03] you're talking about the guy. Yes. It was. So there was like a built-in assumption right there.
[00:45:07] Well, you said you wouldn't take that. You wouldn't take that. What do you think? Oh, actually,
[00:45:11] let me tell you what my life has been like. Yeah. And you, and of course they're looking at me now
[00:45:15] and they think, well, he just, he just aggressively crushed everyone on his rise to the top, right?
[00:45:22] Yeah. It's like, no, not true at all. Yeah. Manuvered. Yeah. Like, played the game. Yeah. Nothing wrong with
[00:45:28] playing the game. Yeah. Now, again, this isn't, we're not talking about like you just become a
[00:45:35] kiss ass. That's not what I'm talking about. Yeah. Being a kiss ass is equally bad. Yeah.
[00:45:40] It's equally bad. You lose just as much respect. Yeah. Not only from your peers, not only from
[00:45:46] your subordinates, but also from the person that you're working with. Yeah. They even know your
[00:45:50] kiss ass. And they'll run rough shot all over you. I want to come sign with motion that, like,
[00:45:53] you know what, I want to pull up the other guy because it doesn't really matter. This guy was going
[00:45:56] to get a kiss my ass regardless. Yeah. Because you're too, you're too agreeable. Yeah. So I'm not
[00:46:02] talking about this. This is a dichotomy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Manuvered. Yeah. Manuvered. So you, again,
[00:46:08] the point that I was making that I think there might have been a misunderstanding, given the
[00:46:13] question. Like, play the game isn't the same as this agreeableness that Jordan Peterson is talking
[00:46:18] about. It's different. They're not the same thing. No. They're not the same thing. Like the
[00:46:23] question that he thought it was the same thing. Yeah. He exactly. He thinks that playing the game is
[00:46:27] being a real ball. Yeah. It's not. Yeah. It might sometimes be acting agreeable. It might be a
[00:46:34] green to some things that make you a little bit frustrated. Yeah. But you roll with it.
[00:46:38] You're rolling. Because you know what? You're playing to win. You're playing the long game.
[00:46:41] This is a joke. This conversation we're having with my, with my boss, with my subordinates.
[00:46:46] Yeah. It's a joke. That thing doesn't matter to me. Yeah. Okay. If I win this argument,
[00:46:49] I'm playing this long game over here. Like, when you're watching a driver? No. Come on,
[00:46:53] bro. You're watching a driver. No. I mean, I've seen shows that. Yeah. Okay. So I don't watch the
[00:46:57] right. Well, I do. I mean, my wife does so. Is this so long? I know. So I think it's still on. Yeah.
[00:47:03] Okay. So, survivor playing the game. And that that's a term that is all up in survival. Playing the
[00:47:12] game. So, okay. Once around, take too long and survive or but it's, it's totally in line with
[00:47:19] where you're talking about. So survivor, you, you know, they throw in here's what the basis, just the
[00:47:24] prime raw basis of survivor you throw a bunch of people on. I know everyone was a base. Yeah.
[00:47:29] You do some challenges. You vote each other off with certain, you know, advantages. You can win
[00:47:35] in what not. Right. We'll reward whatever you mean. So, and how it turned itself like what it morphed
[00:47:42] kind of into just by nature is like this little political game within the game. Right. And now it's just a
[00:47:47] huge overt part of survivor, the political game. I'm playing the game. I'm building alliances. I'm doing
[00:47:54] all this stuff or whatever. It's just exact same thing, man. Exactly. I'm building relationships or
[00:47:58] whatever. Yeah. Let me tell you what the huge difference is. And there's a huge difference. In that
[00:48:05] game, you're playing the game to win for yourself. Yeah. And when I'm talking about, and this is a,
[00:48:10] this is a such a huge part of the way I think that I didn't even talk about it because it's just
[00:48:15] embedded in the way I think. If you're playing the game to further yourself and further your own
[00:48:20] career, it's not going to work for you. Yeah. Because when you play the game like that,
[00:48:24] this is the same thing as like kissing ass. It's the same thing as your, your doing things because you
[00:48:28] want the advantage and people will identify that. If you're making, if you're playing the game so that
[00:48:33] your team can win so that you can accomplish the mission, that's when this works. That's when playing
[00:48:38] the game works. Otherwise, if you're doing it to promote yourself, it's not going to work.
[00:48:42] I need my work once or twice and it might get you one promotion. But everyone that saw you get
[00:48:45] promoted after you kissed us, they're all pissed at you. They're going to undermine you and you're
[00:48:49] going to go down. So interesting about what you just said there is that your absolute right.
[00:48:55] Survivor is like the one guy. So playing the game, I'm playing the game. Any time someone says
[00:49:00] that, hey, I'm playing the game. They do it in this context where it's like, and that's okay,
[00:49:04] we're here. It's a game. So it's acceptable. I'm playing the game. But they'll always say it
[00:49:09] in excuse for lying to someone or backstabbing someone and it's so weird how that, you're exactly
[00:49:16] right. That's the nature of the game. So when you play the game in this condying, and at work or the
[00:49:20] way you're talking about, it's always a good thing. It's always a good thing. It's always looking
[00:49:24] out for the long as you're doing it for the team. Yeah, it's a good thing. There's people that
[00:49:29] play the game and they play the game so that they are going to, you know, I just said this 10 times
[00:49:35] like I played a win. But yeah, I played for my team to win. I played for us to be able to accomplish
[00:49:38] the mission. That's why I'm playing the game. Yeah. If you're playing the game so that you can get
[00:49:43] the promotion or that's not, and like I said, it might work once or twice, but it's not going to be
[00:49:47] it's not a long term solution. Yeah. Yeah. That's a strong statement. I guarantee it's not a long
[00:49:53] term solution. Now what if you, now here's an example, just taking this one step further, you could
[00:49:59] play the game to get that one promotion. And then you could go, okay, now I can play the game to
[00:50:05] help the team. But you had to do some maneuvering to get into a spot where you could help. That's a trick
[00:50:09] you want because people still think you're a jerk because of what you did. But then you get there
[00:50:15] and it's going to take you a long time to build that trust back up because you maneuvered and
[00:50:18] you got collateral damage around there. Yeah. It's not a good thing. It's hard to clean up that
[00:50:21] collateral damage. Yeah, man. So you can't always do it actually. Yeah, careful. You know how you
[00:50:26] say you'll lose a battle to win the war kind of thing. So now in your little example, right there,
[00:50:30] you're like you lost a battle to win a little mini war to essentially lose a bigger battle to win
[00:50:36] a bigger war. You can say that all this little, it's just I can just do you sacrifice a position
[00:50:41] because you know you're going to end up with the area of the game that you're really good at.
[00:50:45] Yeah. Right. I mean, think about pulling art. What's pulling art? Yeah. That's the
[00:50:49] you're sacrificing being on the bottom because you're good at it. Yeah. For a bigger victory.
[00:50:57] This game goes deep, man. This stuff goes deep indeed.
[00:51:01] Wait, the game. All right. Next question. Hey, Jockel. I'll be heading to
[00:51:07] Marines OCS soon. And I know how crucial leadership is for success at OCS. TBS and
[00:51:15] as a Marine. My question is, what happens if you make a decision as a leader that you can
[00:51:19] rationalize at the best as the best decision for the team, but the result is not a good one.
[00:51:25] Well, my superiors want to see that I'm making quality decisions or producing the best results.
[00:51:35] I know good decisions usually lead to good results, but when it doesn't, what's the next best
[00:51:40] way to handle that situation? Well, under evaluation at OCS. Well, like you said, if you make
[00:51:45] good decisions generally, outcomes will be good. But you, but it is a correct statement that
[00:51:49] sometimes you make good decisions and they have bad outcomes. And in combat, that can definitely
[00:51:53] happen if you decide to go left instead of right. If you look to the left and you look to the
[00:51:57] right and the left has better cover than the right. And so you go to the left and then the
[00:52:02] the enemy happened to be, happened to have mortar styled in that area. And so as you go to the
[00:52:07] left, even though there's better cover, you get overhead fire, indirect fire, and people get blown up,
[00:52:14] people get killed. That may have been a good decision, but the result was bad. And there's no
[00:52:19] way you could have known that. So what do you do in those situations? You made the best decision
[00:52:26] that you could with the information that you had at the time, and it turned out to be a bad result.
[00:52:31] As a matter of fact, in a body, when they had a phrase to describe if someone took a shot
[00:52:40] at what they presumed was a bad guy, but it turned out to be, let's say a civilian,
[00:52:45] they would say, and they would investigate heavily to find out what happened. And
[00:52:51] depending on the situation and what happened most of the time, they would call good shot bad
[00:52:56] result, meaning a soldier, marine, someone was looking down a street and they see something and
[00:53:04] they see something suspicious. And then they see an actual, individual out there,
[00:53:09] carrying out enemy tactics, techniques, or procedures. And they judge the situation to the
[00:53:18] best of their ability and an all-vassant pressure arises, and he sees something else that also
[00:53:22] is enemy activity or enemy procedures. And then he's a friendly force approaching and he's like,
[00:53:28] okay, these guys are in danger. I got to do something, takes a shot. And it turns out that what
[00:53:32] the person was doing once they investigate, someone goes and sees what the person was doing,
[00:53:37] they were doing something that was not nefarious. It just didn't happen a lot, but it definitely
[00:53:42] definitely happened. And so the the term that they would use would be good shot bad result.
[00:53:51] And as long as the, as long as there was logic to the decision that was being made,
[00:53:56] and the people that the person that took the shot owned it and said, here's what I saw,
[00:54:01] this is the shot that I took. That's what happened. I owned it. And, you know, the upper chain
[00:54:09] of command would then say, okay, well, number one, is there anything we can learn from this?
[00:54:13] Is there anything that we could learn to prevent this from happening again? And if we can,
[00:54:20] then we spread that word until everyone would happen and why it happened. And if there's any
[00:54:24] way to improve the decision making process. Now, the biggest mistake that, so that's what you do,
[00:54:30] you own it, you see what you can learn from it and you move on. And your leadership and your
[00:54:33] instructors are going to see the same thing. They're going to see that you had a logic if you can
[00:54:36] explain why you made a decision. Now, your explanation might be bad. You know, your explanation might
[00:54:42] be bad. You might have prioritized wrong. You might have read the terrain wrong. You might have
[00:54:47] assumed that the enemy was going to do something and they did something else. Those are bad,
[00:54:53] bad things that led to your decision. Those are bad choices. Those are bad assessments. Those are
[00:54:56] mistakes that you made. And so those what led to your logic may be fault, faulted.
[00:55:03] Would that be a, like a dingy against you in a good spot? Yes, it would for wouldn't be a good shot.
[00:55:09] Yeah, because if you said, well, I thought that the guy was, I thought there was a curfew in the
[00:55:18] area. Well, there was no curfew. Why did you not know that? You know what I mean? Like,
[00:55:21] so not a good shot. That's an excuse. Right. That's not a good shot. You took a shot that your logic
[00:55:27] doesn't match up. Yeah. Yeah. But the other big, all right, say the biggest mistake, of course,
[00:55:32] that people make when they make a bad decision or things that don't make sense is that they defend
[00:55:37] them when they blame other people. They blame other circumstances. And that's what they say.
[00:55:43] Well, I wouldn't know and told me. No one told me that that or the, the sergeant was pointing in
[00:55:49] that direction. So that's where I told everyone to go. Like, no, don't do that. Don't
[00:55:54] don't make excuses. Right. Don't make excuses. It's like saying, well, I did a perfect job,
[00:56:00] but the, but the enemy used mortars. And that's out of my control. Like, no, instead of saying,
[00:56:05] so like the first case, like if you, if you went left and said, right, you ended up getting mortars,
[00:56:09] you know, you said, well, the, I didn't expect the enemy to use mortars. That's, that's not my fault.
[00:56:13] Then said, you said, you said, you know what? I should have done a better job assessing the
[00:56:16] mortar for it. And I should have had more space between my troops because that's another thing
[00:56:21] that I screwed up is my troops are too close together. And so we had multiple get wounded with one
[00:56:25] mortar round. That shouldn't have happened. And we could have moved quicker through that area,
[00:56:30] which I failed to do. So those are the things I'm going to fix next time. And there you have it.
[00:56:35] There you have it. Don't make excuses. If you own it and you explain what you can do better,
[00:56:40] the instructor's going to agree and they're going to move on. And if you make excuses,
[00:56:43] the instructors are going to eat you live. And by the way, if you make bad decisions continually
[00:56:50] and you keep owning them, well, let's say you keep making bad decisions. And so you start thinking
[00:56:55] yourself, well, I can't take ownership of this anymore. I'm going to get kicked out of here.
[00:57:00] Well, guess what? So then you start making excuses for him. You're really going to kick out of there.
[00:57:05] You're really going to kick out of there. So that's something to keep in mind. Also, keep in
[00:57:09] mind that the instructors know everything that's happening. They can see so much more than you can.
[00:57:15] And I know this because I was instructor for a lot. I was running the training for a long time.
[00:57:19] You can see so much one of the class, because you go through off to Canada, it's going to
[00:57:22] not allow to look at your food. And when I first, this is what they say, don't look at your food.
[00:57:26] So I sat down the first meal. And I'm like, I'm known to go to know if I'm looking at my food,
[00:57:30] how can they tell? And so I just go and stand down my food. And, ultimately, there's drone
[00:57:34] instructors all over you yelling at you. And the food told you not to look at your food,
[00:57:37] your weak and all that stuff. And I'm thinking how did they know? 13 weeks later, or 12 weeks
[00:57:42] weeks later, at Officer Canada, it's going to your candidate officer, which means you're now
[00:57:48] kind of in between the recruits and the drone instructors. And so you're allowed to walk around
[00:57:53] and you're reinforcing. And you go to the one of the tables where there's 30 recruits sitting there
[00:57:59] or Officer Canada sitting there. And you look down the line. And when someone glances at
[00:58:03] their food for a millisecond, it's completely obvious. It's so completely obvious. You can't hide it.
[00:58:09] I'm talking just their eyes are moved. Yeah, it's so obvious. And that's what it's like with
[00:58:14] everything when you're going through tactical training, the instructors can really see a lot.
[00:58:17] They can't see it that much because it's a little less control. But they can see a lot. And also
[00:58:22] they have things planned and part of the plan is that you're going to fail sometimes. They're going
[00:58:25] to set it up that way. And they want to see how you react to that. They want to see how you handle
[00:58:30] the stress, a number one of an unwindable situation. And then when you fail, how do you react to
[00:58:34] failure itself? Do you just blame your adults? Do you not? You wasn't my fault because that's what you're
[00:58:39] doing. It's going to be problematic. And the last thing I would say to this guy here, do relax a little
[00:58:46] bit, right? Because you haven't even gone to OCS yet. And yet you're fearing judgment. You're fearing
[00:58:52] not being considered to be perfect and you're not going to be perfect. And you're going to be absolutely
[00:58:57] judged. It's okay. Be humble. Do your best. And have a great time. It's awesome. Military training is so fun.
[00:59:06] Interesting. I heard mixed opinions about that. But hey, I'll tell you. You don't like,
[00:59:11] you know why it's easy to see you looking at your food. Why? It's an anatomical thing. When you
[00:59:17] look down your eyelids and eyelashes, all that stuff goes boom, they just shift down and
[00:59:23] super obvious physically to see. Yeah. Yeah. Notice that. If you look side to side, not much,
[00:59:27] only your little eyeball or whatever. But if you look down, but you can't look down without doing
[00:59:31] your eyelids. You're saying, like, you get it. Like, when you look down, your eyelids just
[00:59:35] any eyelashes. All I do is this. It's real obvious. Yeah. Real obvious. It's funny though. Yeah.
[00:59:40] Because I, I the same thing. I thought it was going to get to it. Oh, no, you can't. And it's not like
[00:59:45] you can act like you're looking at something else. And then you can't do that because it's, you know,
[00:59:49] you're going to have to shoot ahead. It was actually for so funny how I got so busted. And how
[00:59:54] cocky I was thinking how how they're going to stop me from looking at my food. I'll just go and
[00:59:57] stand. And they just are on you and like on the other guys. Yeah. And you look down. This is jump on
[01:00:04] it. It's crazy. It's good. I feel like this, this kind of thing may be a good way to look at it.
[01:00:11] And I'm only going on based on kind of what you said. But like any, any decision like situation
[01:00:16] where you're going to okay, I'm going to make the right call or the right, you know,
[01:00:20] tactics or what, you know, to get a certain result or whatever. It's really when you kind of think
[01:00:25] about it or what I do anyway. It, there's always an element of chance. Remember how like okay,
[01:00:30] so I'm going to the post office. Right. I'm driving. There is like okay, so me saying, okay, I'm going
[01:00:36] to go to the go to the safest route to the post office. Let me get there. But boom, I'm going to
[01:00:39] deal with their verb or mail my thing. I'm going to come on. The chance that I get killed in one
[01:00:45] way or another car accident, you know, whatever, whatever is there, very small. But it's still there.
[01:00:53] So, and not to say, you know, not to say the how big or small of the chance these things are. I'm
[01:00:58] just saying there is an element of chance regardless how big or small of something getting in the
[01:01:03] way of your success, even if you make all the right decisions or if you make the wrong decisions,
[01:01:07] there's chance just involved in general. Here, you just maybe think of something that can
[01:01:12] jam people up as you like to say. Sure. And this is something that guys used to say to me.
[01:01:17] And so you need to try and avoid this. People would say, I was trying to make, I was trying to do what
[01:01:24] what I thought you would want me to do. Right. Like I thought that's what you would want to see.
[01:01:29] That's what they'd say. Well, I thought that you would want me to do. I thought that that's
[01:01:32] what you want to see. So, if you start playing that game, like you start assessing what's going on,
[01:01:38] and then you start adding a layer of like what do the instructors want me to do right here.
[01:01:42] Yeah. The chances are that that's not going to turn out well because you're trying to predict what
[01:01:48] you should do is look at what's happening and make the best decision possible from your perspective.
[01:01:55] With the minute you start thinking, they, you know, they just taught a class on
[01:01:59] on breaking contact. They probably want me to break contact right here. So you call a break
[01:02:04] contact and then everyone runs away and then they go, why did you break contact? It was one guy
[01:02:07] with a rifle and you had a 40-man-plotoon. What's wrong with you? And they go, and then, and then what
[01:02:12] you say is, well, I thought you wanted us to know. We want you to run a good tactical situation.
[01:02:18] Yeah. Don't do what people, what you think will people want you to do. Don't do that. Genreally.
[01:02:22] I'm not saying don't weigh it at all because they're teaching you something. But don't be stupid.
[01:02:28] Yeah, don't do stupid. This is a good advice. But yeah, but see, I'm saying,
[01:02:32] know that that chance is always there. Yeah. So it's always judged. And it's weird how like
[01:02:37] when you, when you're successful in something, I don't know, whatever, even like in like life,
[01:02:42] like if you're, you're, you're, I don't know, you're career or something. When you're successful in it,
[01:02:47] you don't really talk about the chance element, you know. But if you're unsuccessful, that's when
[01:02:52] you'll be like, oh, just hey, it's just bad luck. You know, hey, these chance kind of situations
[01:02:57] or whatever. So it seems like, you know, ain't given what you said that his kind of objective or his
[01:03:03] kind of outlook or his way of being when he goes into the situation is, hey, man, sure, there's,
[01:03:09] there's going to be these chance that there's going to be a chance that the result isn't going to
[01:03:14] be that good. There's a chance. And there's a chance that it's me good or whatever, but focus on the decision,
[01:03:19] sound decision making. And then if a half the chance comes or the lock or the probability,
[01:03:25] the improbable situation or whatever, that kind of negates your good decision making with its
[01:03:32] bad result, then hey, man, still focus on your decision making. Don't be like, oh, look,
[01:03:37] where was someone else's thing that I had no control over? Kind of thing. Let me see.
[01:03:41] Sure. Next question. Next question.
[01:03:47] Jock, go in, jujitsu. I telegraphed my moves. When I focus on whatever escape or submission, I'm attempting,
[01:03:56] and it's pretty obvious to whom I'm training with. How do I learn to work on a particular move?
[01:04:00] Well, actually setting up another move at the same time. As sense of this. Yeah, that's a
[01:04:06] so jujitsu. Dave, I request you by the way. Interesting. Yeah. Okay, so good question. And actually
[01:04:14] reveal something pretty cool about jujitsu in many cases in jujitsu, especially like the first
[01:04:21] three to five years of training, and that that's a pretty big span. But what's interesting about
[01:04:27] is that the setups for moves are actually other moves. Right. So, and you actually have to
[01:04:36] attempt the other move legitimately in order for it to work as a setup. So, if you're mounted
[01:04:42] on someone and you want an arm lock somebody, don't grab their arm. That's the telegraph.
[01:04:47] What you do is you go for the choke. And you don't just fake go for the choke. You go for the
[01:04:54] choke. You put those, you dig in, you grab some ghee. You start to attack their neck. And obviously,
[01:05:01] if they don't defend, then you choke them, which is awesome. But you can so you go for the
[01:05:06] choke for real. But if they lift up their arm to defend their neck, which they should do, then
[01:05:13] boom, they are mock exposed and you take it. That's the way it works. And the same thing goes with
[01:05:20] Cameroos. Like the Camira sweep, ghee-teen. You know that combo from the guards, really like a basic one
[01:05:25] that you learn from the gums. Yeah, the bumps sweep, the Camira and the ghee-teen from the guard.
[01:05:29] The defense for each one of those is the setup for the other. And there's so many, you know,
[01:05:36] you just do it. Like that's what you do to it. It's like trying a alarm lock. It's,
[01:05:41] it's just that that's the way it is. You have to commit to the moves. You can't just like,
[01:05:46] if you do a half-hearted attempt to do a sit-up sweep on me, I'm not going to give you the reaction
[01:05:51] that you need to get a ghee-teen on me. Right? Because if you don't push me back hard enough,
[01:05:58] I'm not going to lean forward enough. You're not going to be able to grab my neck. Yeah.
[01:06:00] So it's not going to work. Now, as you progress in Gigiitsu, you're able to start attacking
[01:06:07] other things like, for instance, you can attack someone's balance. As I set up, you can attack
[01:06:12] your base. You can attack their posture. As a setup, you can attack their arm position. So you can
[01:06:18] attack the better you get it. Gigiitsu, you can attack some conceptual things. Dean said something
[01:06:23] like that the other day. I was like, dang, that's smart. What he was saying was he's like, hey,
[01:06:28] he said the person on the bottom can't fall down. Dean said that. Yeah. It's a little bit
[01:06:36] thin. I know it's a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a little bit. Profound. Right? The person on the bottom
[01:06:41] can't fall down. You can't, you can't mess with my balance at all. But I can't mess with you.
[01:06:46] If you're on top, I can mess with your balance. That's one of the key things that I try and
[01:06:49] mess with. Your balance. You can't mess with my balance. I'm on the ground. Yeah.
[01:06:55] Think about that one. Actually, you did say that that Dean said that, but I'm not sure. I don't
[01:07:00] know if you said that. You can't knock me down when I'm on the ground. Yeah. Well, that may be just
[01:07:05] where I put it. But that's true. Let's see. These principles obviously they apply, not only
[01:07:14] Gigiitsu, but they apply to the battlefield and they apply to the business. Because if you
[01:07:18] fake a frontal assault to expose the enemy's flank, but you don't put enough firepower in the
[01:07:24] frontal assault, then the enemy doesn't have to react to it. So they just kind of keep their perimeter
[01:07:30] secure. And then when you flank them, their flank is defended. Yeah. So it's the same exact thing.
[01:07:35] Yeah. You have to commit enough to throw the person to make the person react. If you don't
[01:07:42] give them enough, they're not going to react in the business world. If you come up with a, if you put
[01:07:47] up a new product to contend with your competitor in some market, but the product isn't strong enough
[01:07:54] that it becomes any kind of threat. Well, then the competitors enough to contend with it all.
[01:07:58] And you've actually wasted effort. So if you're going to go, go, go, get the reaction that you need.
[01:08:06] If you're going to execute a move to set up your opponent, it has to be strong enough to
[01:08:10] listen to real reaction. That's what you have to do. Now you could do something that's like a
[01:08:17] little distraction. That's a little different than a setup. Right. You can distract someone.
[01:08:22] Usually the distraction is much more minor than a real setup. I can get you thinking about
[01:08:26] something else while I go over here. Yeah. Not as effective, but it has its times. Yeah.
[01:08:34] Yeah. So interesting. I think Dave worked mentioned that idea to me before. Wait, is this a
[01:08:40] question from Dave's first straight up? Yeah. So, and here's another thing Dave works kind of
[01:08:45] early in the in the game to and which is a good thing because he's thinking about this stuff already.
[01:08:52] But I think generally speaking like these those types of tactics like where I'm going to go
[01:08:58] for this and then when he reacts to that thing, I went for it then I'm going to really do my
[01:09:02] real move kind of thing and there can be chains too, by the way. I can do one thing because that's
[01:09:06] the advantage. And the more you advance two people get when they're really against each other,
[01:09:10] the more that you'll see. So, but being early on or the more that you won't see, I remember when
[01:09:17] Dean and I were training like maniacs, burping and people would watch us and it barely even
[01:09:24] looked like you did to because the movements were so subtle. Like sometimes you wouldn't even like
[01:09:28] I would just feel his weight shift and I would immediately shift my weight and so there's three
[01:09:33] or four offensive and defensive moves that happen and there's barely any movement that's visual
[01:09:38] because it's all in the weight. Yeah. So, when you mean when you don't see it's like it's just so subtle
[01:09:44] that you don't see it can't see it. But it's yeah, Toby still there of course. So that's that's
[01:09:51] kind of good that I think anyway that he's thinking that you know how to do that. But I think what's
[01:09:57] more important given the stage and this is real generally speaking because people are different but
[01:10:03] learn the moves, you know the crisp like move like how to do an arm lock where your hips should
[01:10:09] be and shouldn't be and what makes it an arm lock a good arm lock and when makes an arm lock,
[01:10:14] for example a bad arm lock, you know where it's like you know how some guys can do an arm lock but
[01:10:18] it's like super easy to escape because you have these three details that you just didn't even though
[01:10:22] you know what an arm lock is kind of thing. So, I think I think anyway that when when you start to
[01:10:27] get those things down you're like a brown belt no. Yeah, all the yeah yeah yeah he's got a good
[01:10:34] arm lock. Yeah you got it you're gonna watch out for that thing but he's an example of like
[01:10:38] his arm lock is really good and everyone's got the really good moves. Yeah yeah that's a good
[01:10:41] example and when when you get and you know have full of those down or you're just your general
[01:10:47] game down in that particular way then you can start like leaking into that kind of way thinking
[01:10:54] where it's like okay I'm gonna go for this arm lock you know and then I'm not sure I 100% disagree
[01:10:59] with you because in my mind if you don't set things up they're not gonna work. Yeah so you have to
[01:11:04] set them up and you have to start learning where that set up looks like. Yeah but as I mean Dave
[01:11:08] works at that position right now this this the moves are not working because he's not setting
[01:11:12] them up because he's telegrafting him. Yeah so yeah that's why he's asking the question. Yeah so
[01:11:17] when you this is the this is the answer to when that question comes which it will when you start
[01:11:23] training GJitsu and you start training against people that know what you know or at least some of
[01:11:28] what you know they're gonna defend. Yeah and it's proper that they defend because their defense
[01:11:33] is a setup for your next move. Yeah that's the part you got to realize. Yeah so considered
[01:11:39] and when he asked me this before or when he talked about African-to-exactly when it was I was
[01:11:44] considering it through his point of view right or and with an expert okay so but this point of
[01:11:50] you and my point of view so if I'm rolling with a white belt and like a real new white belt and
[01:11:54] he's doing the move that they learn that day so he's doing it step by step by the way he learned
[01:12:00] and I'm like okay this is this that's the ultimate in telegrafting by the way when you're looking
[01:12:04] at the steps that you just watched them learn kind of thing. You might even have dotted to him
[01:12:08] so when they do that it's I think that's appropriate as far as the learning process early on it's
[01:12:14] like yeah get those down. Yeah practice that part of it yeah it's not gonna work it in fact it might
[01:12:18] work on another super new new guy. Yeah and and you I know I've rolled with guys Dean is one of them
[01:12:25] where he you know what he's gonna do. Yeah you know what he's gonna do. He might as well tell you
[01:12:31] yeah what he's gonna do and and he's gonna do it. Yeah now sometimes you give up like you give up
[01:12:36] an inch and all of a sudden you feel it and you go oh man I'm gonna my arm is exposed. Yeah and
[01:12:41] you and you spend the next two minutes defending that arm and there's nothing you can do to stop it
[01:12:45] right but in I think we both know that that's so much different in this way because if Dean's like
[01:12:51] okay man that's so multi-dimensional compared to like a white belt telegrafting his moves because Dean
[01:12:56] okay Dean for example he's black I'm gonna get mount and I'm gonna do armor. So him getting mount
[01:13:01] is gonna be all these little micro like things in there. Yeah. Not to mention the psychological
[01:13:07] war that he just waged on you and he's ahead by the way. So you got that and then you got all these
[01:13:13] little things where he goes for mount he's just gonna he's just gonna get mount so to get mount
[01:13:16] you got to do a certain you know thing in his case so when he does those things that's gonna
[01:13:21] be a bunch of those things that you're talking about all this thing I'm gonna fake this side but
[01:13:24] then I'm gonna go this side I'm gonna shift my weight so he shifts his weight that way so he
[01:13:28] so I go here so he so there's little many things but he's just so good at it that he'll do he can
[01:13:34] just do it like that true so I think I mean again the the point there is like it's it's a lot
[01:13:38] different with a guy who Dean when he says I'm gonna get mount and I'm an armbar you he's not
[01:13:44] telegraphy anything he's telling you sure but he's not technically telegraphy like like
[01:13:48] all my belt situation but either way I get it either way I mean everyone's different
[01:13:52] I do think that learning those steps and learning what a good I think getting that part down
[01:13:57] early on early on is is I think more foundational it's foundational once you start asking the
[01:14:03] question why won't anyone tap to my moves I need to set them up better here you go yeah
[01:14:08] yes I think you're right about that that's right you know to your point how you get when you
[01:14:12] want to do so it's kind of like a faint right in boxing maybe a little bit more like how you say
[01:14:16] I'm gonna when I go for a move as this as a set up move you got to really sell that move you got
[01:14:21] a really big going for that so it's like bait right yeah in fact you ever watch the movie
[01:14:25] bait no okay so bait is moving with Jamie Fox and you know some other people anyway so one of the
[01:14:32] guys it's it's long so I don't want to so they're trying to catch this did this gold thief right in
[01:14:38] bit so this gold thief it but he's a real genius computer nerd gold thief and he's super good at
[01:14:44] hiding the way you pronounce that you're like gold thief I was like okay this is a guy that's
[01:14:51] gold he's a criminal but he's like a computer guy you know he's a super genius easy like hides
[01:14:56] really well and super hard to find and all this and so the guy at the FBI guy whoever you know the
[01:15:03] the law enforcement dude he's like hey we got to set some bait so this guy comes out and gets the
[01:15:09] bait but when you set bait you can't be some fake thing and this bait has to be real like a
[01:15:15] wall you know when you try to catch a wolf the bait has to be real there can't be just some
[01:15:19] bait you bought kind of kind of idea so you know so the idea of the movie is they get this guy
[01:15:25] Jamie Fox and they make him the bait but he doesn't know he's the bait because he has to be
[01:15:30] real has to be he can be tainted with the human scent he got to be a real live piece of bait so
[01:15:35] that's essentially what your move's got to be absolutely you got to be like hey look if my bait is
[01:15:39] the armlock if I'm going to bait the kymura to get the sit-up sweep that kymura got to be a fresh
[01:15:45] plucked out of the wild kymura attempt and then when he goes and reacts to it or bites it
[01:15:52] pull my get the sit-up sweep same exact thing so yeah they got to the the set up
[01:15:57] move got a smell real got a smell real. that's how I like to keep on my moves smelling super real
[01:16:05] you seem same check all right next question does discipline ever fail you does discipline ever fail you
[01:16:22] no actually discipline does not fail me I fail discipline that's what happens on days where I
[01:16:33] wear off the path and on to the slippery slope of weakness it isn't disciplines fault
[01:16:44] it's my fault I'm the one that's being weak I'm the one that's not holding the line I'm the one
[01:16:52] that is deciding to take the short term gratification instead of a long term domination
[01:17:00] when laziness or e-p-send it's not it's not discipline that open the door
[01:17:11] it's me it's me rationalizing and explaining and justifying that laziness
[01:17:21] when I decide to take the easy path instead of the righteous path of discipline that is my
[01:17:29] decision that's all on me it's me deciding to cave to my weaknesses and become a slave to them
[01:17:41] and when I make that error when I let discipline down there's only one thing to do and that's
[01:17:52] get back on the path get back on it and then step it up and go harder and push more and
[01:18:02] pay for your transgressions cleanse yourself in the fire and the suffering of the discipline
[01:18:13] and get back on the path the hard unrelenting path of discipline that path that leads
[01:18:26] to freedom and I think that's all I've got for tonight so echo yes speaking of the
[01:18:40] path against weakness sure you know anyways it maybe you could help us down that path yeah
[01:18:48] first I will talk about our company origin okay what origin does a lot of stuff
[01:18:56] actually impressive stuff first thing they do maybe not the first thing but one of the many things they
[01:19:02] do is I guess technically it's origin labs right yeah so jocca some supplements jocca super
[01:19:10] krill oil and joint warfare from origin labs these supplements are for your joints and of course
[01:19:17] they are the best ones for your joints unless you made one that or not is not the best for your joints
[01:19:23] no we think you're one's had the best one right yeah yes indeed yeah someone tweeted at me I think
[01:19:30] that's the you tweet at someone okay that's the thing anyway so they're like hey I ran out of
[01:19:35] joint warfare big mistake yeah and it was kind of like just kind of expressing himself I mean I did
[01:19:40] it because I've done that too so you get on the the subscription deal yeah I think you did yeah lots of
[01:19:47] that's a the joint warfare in the krill oil like try it if you if you if you if you have any
[01:19:56] joint issues at all try it seriously try it it will help you yeah it will absolutely help you
[01:20:03] which is awesome yeah and part of that which I did mention I think maybe last time there's anti-inflammatory
[01:20:09] stuff in there too like natural stuff not like ibuprofen something like that like anti-inflammatory
[01:20:14] so so that helps a lot and you know I'm rarely like super impressed with I mean not like my
[01:20:21] standard just so high I'm just saying like I understand supplements are like there supplements cool I
[01:20:26] dig it kind of thing but this is one that I was like this is this is an important one 100%
[01:20:32] door and out just don't don't run out also discipline discipline is a what we are calling officially
[01:20:40] a pre-mission supplement so whatever your mission is physical mental emotional sure
[01:20:49] but there's a thing called emotional intelligence I don't have emotions so I can't yeah you
[01:20:54] can't talk about that one I don't know the effects good point put it this way I have never lost my
[01:21:00] temper I have never broke down and cried well the beautiful while I'm on the discipline there you go
[01:21:09] so the proof is in the pudding so it is an emotional enhancing situation as well but whatever your mission
[01:21:15] is there's some neutral pick stuff in there for cognitive enhancement and a little bit of caffeine
[01:21:21] if you're into caffeine a little bit micro dose as we call it you know that's a good one too don't
[01:21:27] run out also moke moke is moke I had some other day two scoops what is one serving one
[01:21:37] one scoop yeah one serving one scoop moke protein powder you know okay we'll we'll we'll say
[01:21:42] protein but you will definitely technically yeah it is right then you realize that technically
[01:21:48] what it really is is moke yeah you know what it is I'll tell you what you mix it with milk of course
[01:21:54] 100% yeah what do you mix it with water like a cycle probably try to water them no it's actually
[01:22:02] like I said the other day it's not bad with water it's not bad it's like satisfying it's a ham sandwich
[01:22:08] but it's not it's not in charge of milkshake style yeah yeah like like I'm cracking out
[01:22:12] dandy right when you was like music yeah you could live off it or you know I have no idea what
[01:22:20] you're saying like sure it's fine with the other one no you're talking about I don't forget what
[01:22:25] it's talking about I recommend yeah the milk and you know what else if you're let's say you're
[01:22:30] lactose intolerant I'm in milk no no problem all the milk is also awesome all the
[01:22:34] although they do make lactose free milk no which is very similar tasting to regular milk like
[01:22:39] surprisingly similar because I accidentally bought some before and I was drinking I was like
[01:22:45] oh the cool but I was like does this taste different like you know it's like a question it's not
[01:22:51] guaranteed it could have been me I maybe I brushed my teeth too soon before I drank the milk you
[01:22:56] know something like this foul nobody see it you can do certain things that affects your
[01:23:01] little taste buds or whatever it was like that it was like it was a question mark it wasn't like
[01:23:06] dang I bought the wrong milk like if you think you're drinking I don't know regular milk but then
[01:23:11] it's like soy milk or canned milk or powder milk that can be added because it wouldn't be in my house
[01:23:18] in the rest of us you know the difference that's the point you know the different
[01:23:23] lactose free milk and regular milk like the difference isn't that obvious in my opinion yeah
[01:23:29] yeah if you're lactose intolerant but more nonetheless technically it's protein powder you don't this
[01:23:32] is why you don't like to say protein powder yeah and we have right now we only have mint but we have
[01:23:38] we have peanut butter coming it's gonna be the one yeah check this is what I'm
[01:23:48] chocolate peanut butter by the way yeah okay and the mint isn't mint it's mint chocolate yeah
[01:23:54] so yeah so protein powder makes it sound what I'm saying before the protein powder makes
[01:23:58] it sound like oh it's just one of these many protein powders that are out there kind of thing
[01:24:02] that's the feeling yeah that's not the feeling you get when you drink it yeah it's a
[01:24:06] way different if it would have not been milk we would have called it protein powder yeah
[01:24:11] it was protein powder with the with the umo yeah yeah I thought that was like some Viking thing
[01:24:20] the way you're having it okay hard core heavy metal to heavy metal like when you go to this
[01:24:25] it's like this yeah and no it's your cold this one the first the first album that had it was
[01:24:30] blue it's your cold and then probably the most the most famous that has the disc motorhead
[01:24:35] and that's because the two fingers you know like rock on and I I Reese before I released this I
[01:24:40] researched it this how I know this and and lemme from motorheads quote as to why he used the
[01:24:47] emote was because he said it looks mean that's his quote that's always said yeah no big philosophical
[01:24:53] representation of like while they represent eyes there's no no there's a layer there's a layer
[01:24:58] there's a layer yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:25:04] yeah it doesn't look mean sounds cool to me lemme yeah and then now it's on the mok those
[01:25:08] layers that's layers so you've provided another layer it has been turned into layers and also
[01:25:13] you know you know how you say rock like I said well this is what I thought you know when
[01:25:18] you say rock on and you have the two fingers right point index finger and then you know
[01:25:21] in the pinky boom rock on if you were to I don't know why people don't say rock on any
[01:25:25] boy I don't know about I'm not in the scene so you know you do that motion and let's say you had
[01:25:31] some I don't know some chalk or something on your hand uh from doing deadlift or something like this
[01:25:35] and then you touch the wall boom you got your own luck right there that's what I thought it for real
[01:25:39] what that's interesting my name is echo you're gonna be the way to creative or your mind is wondering
[01:25:45] a little too much I think other people might have thought that too think about this okay my name is echo
[01:25:49] obviously it's my real name by the way I have a twin brother named Jade he's older by 15 minutes
[01:25:55] I'm the second twin right yeah follow so my first great teacher was she said oh yeah your
[01:26:02] name's echo that makes sense now because you're your brother's echo yeah seems seen now it's like
[01:26:07] dang that is man my parents are smart yeah no I thought that too yeah yeah so I go home
[01:26:15] and I asked and my mom was like wow no not at all I just thought it was cool same thing is lemme
[01:26:20] yeah same exact thing she thought it was mean no not mean just just cool and how should I say like
[01:26:26] you foric my mom was happy anyway back to the market still peanut butter chocolate not out yet
[01:26:33] but we'll be out soon look forward to that one big time also strangely are you is peanut butter
[01:26:39] chocolate your second favorite flavor um I don't know it's peats by the way it's right up there yeah
[01:26:48] yeah and it's mine by the way peats sent me like a text when he first got the peanut butter one
[01:26:54] and I can tell that he was real fired up yeah no he was he had a real strength he's like
[01:27:00] just mix this up you know it's like a little thing just mix this up only you know you see the
[01:27:05] thing leave the screen and then he slams it back down bro so that's a good signer yeah yeah
[01:27:13] I mean it's kind of a pain because then he has to take it and because he only give you one sample
[01:27:17] so then he fed x is like Fed x I'm like sending me the rest so it's in route you gotta break it up like
[01:27:23] um like in little bags so good you see yeah so be on the lookout for that if you care if you if you
[01:27:30] want some more be on the lookout for that also geese and rash cards that's what origin has again
[01:27:37] origin main dot com this stuff is all made in America by the way side note where's that even side
[01:27:42] note yeah that's the note straight up note note this all this made in prayer so geese and rash
[01:27:47] cards geese okay why is that relevant because we're talking about you just to you today everyone's
[01:27:50] still not everyone people still ask me weekly maybe even bi weekly what geese should I get
[01:27:58] point me in a direction of a good geese here there's all do it i'll do it right now origin geese
[01:28:04] whichever one you want whichever two you want whichever three yeah there's people i people that missed
[01:28:09] the original def ghee the discipline was freedom ghee yeah that says good after on the on the
[01:28:15] tail sure it's called the skirt i thought it's called the skirt the tail anyways the back of the
[01:28:20] the back of the ghee top on the bottom it says good after but they originally made those or we
[01:28:28] originally made those as a like you know kind of like a what's it but yeah yeah yeah no just uh
[01:28:37] what's that word like special only yeah special edition yeah special edition
[01:28:43] anyways but everyone liked them and so now they're part of the part of the line yeah and
[01:28:50] put a line up yeah good yeah i noticed the white one is available now and so is the black
[01:28:55] okay they're both up boom whatever color you want also another question people asked about the
[01:28:59] geese they're like hey what color should i get like is it crazy to get a green gear something like this
[01:29:05] right you know the two people ask you that still yeah sometimes yes people seem to come to you
[01:29:10] more for geese it's probably more of a fashion like thing that said they go to you maybe and well
[01:29:15] yeah well the origin geese looked up to by the way and that's not just because you mentioned fashion
[01:29:21] they do that's like one of the one of the what pizza got a little fashion street again yes he does you
[01:29:25] know like that actually no that's good that he does because you don't yeah i don't know if you
[01:29:29] compliment no fashion street my fashion street gives t-shirts yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:29:34] t-shirt in other words no fashion street nonetheless the colors of the geese are going to
[01:29:39] depend on your instructor or your academy true so these you know like if your academy allows
[01:29:45] whatever color geese want like victory does then you whatever color you want then you kind of
[01:29:51] go into this game with it the game which actually doesn't really exist really and that's like
[01:29:56] if you're a new guy and you show up with a pink geek or a crazy like you know those weird geese
[01:30:02] and a gold belt or something like how Jeff clevery so where that gold belt or was it friend
[01:30:06] you did that they bought it anyway bill cooper even if you do that then it's like hey you know
[01:30:12] but this more that's more of like social fabric kind of thing but if it comes onto the the
[01:30:18] the school so some rigid schools only white yeah some rigid schools and then the more traditional
[01:30:25] it's like white or blue that's it don't do a green don't do a black what you're cool in my opinion
[01:30:31] and then you get the schools where like I'm whatever and maybe this in between I never heard of
[01:30:37] any but maybe this in between so pointer as your instructor well color then boom get that color
[01:30:41] originmate dot com that's the deal also rash guards on there good rash guards by the way

[01:34:48] probably since like a college time but I mean yeah that's not a family work but I'm just seeing it's
[01:34:55] far as like what I did today think about it's hot so nice to have a tank top on yeah yeah I did
[01:34:59] get angry so yeah so tank tops yeah be on look I always find it not strange but I always don't want
[01:35:07] to say be on the lookout for that like it's this big thing you gotta be on the lookout but kind you
[01:35:11] know if you're down for the tank tops hey be on the lookout for it I guess right sure
[01:35:17] then let's jocco store dot com and get some patches I got some warrior kid patches
[01:35:21] I got this will those should be on there right now actually for the warrior kids and the
[01:35:27] geese and the geese the backpack wherever you want to put down you don't represent where your
[01:35:32] kids also other patches on there too discipline equals freedom what not also psychological warfare
[01:35:38] if you didn't know what that is it's an album with tracks jocco tracks that help you through
[01:35:44] every moment of weakness that you might come across can not because apparently not all of us
[01:35:49] go through moments of weakness it's rare but some people they just power through for those types
[01:35:54] of people psychological warfare not for them I think I think they just power through and continue
[01:35:59] powering through maybe even teach us how to just power through but for the rest of us hit
[01:36:05] moments of weakness we listen to psychological warfare given what the weakness is so if my weakness
[01:36:10] is hitting the snooze and not getting up early there's a track for that it's jocco on that
[01:36:16] track talking to you telling you why you should get up not yelling he's playing the game quote
[01:36:22] unquote actually he's not technically playing the game on a track he's just flanking
[01:36:27] it's not a no yeah just explain pragmatically like why the value you could say that
[01:36:32] it is a little bit of a flank going on because it's getting everyone that listens to like it hits
[01:36:37] the spot right yes it nails the target yeah of why because I know where the weakness comes from
[01:36:42] it happens to me yeah and so I just talk about how you just over that thing yeah ha ha because technically
[01:36:48] the very reason or by the very nature of you wanting to stay in bed that's by it's very nature
[01:36:55] a reinforced position because you're rationalizing in your head you're defending your actions
[01:37:00] or your potential actions you're defending that already in your own head so you're going to
[01:37:04] jocco on the jocco track you don't attack those things you just come around and say hey
[01:37:09] hey I take it you know the bed is I dig it you know all this stuff you fight it's good
[01:37:15] and there's a track for all these little weaknesses good 100% effectiveness by the way
[01:37:20] get it on iTunes or wherever wherever you can buy MP3 it's on like Amazon music whatnot as well
[01:37:25] yeah well speaking of Amazon if you want to get something called jocco white tea you can get that
[01:37:30] on Amazon you should only get it if you want to have an 8,000 pound dead lift because that's what
[01:37:34] it results in otherwise drink some other tea you now this is cool we have jocco white tea in a can
[01:37:45] coming out in June on Amazon get some obviously the goal is to eventually get them out at
[01:37:54] retail so you can have that option everywhere you go instead of drinking the junk energy drinks
[01:38:01] that are bad for you so yeah I'll let y'all know when it hits Amazon it's been made by the way if
[01:38:09] you're wondering a ton of it a bunch of it way more than a ton actually a lot of it has been made
[01:38:16] because I think well I know I want it so it worst case scenario I have a lifetime supply of
[01:38:21] jocco white tea in a can and you know I don't know what is well there's a little debate you know
[01:38:28] what you call it you know wait what you call what the jocco white tea because I was kind of thinking
[01:38:33] well there's another name we could give it we could call it 8,000 pound dead lift and it can
[01:38:39] sure yes but no we're still calling it jocco white tea in books
[01:38:43] way the warrior kid tons the series right there's two books out right now and so much awesome
[01:38:52] feedback on that it's awesome thanks for posting pictures of your kids studying reading doing book
[01:38:58] reports training jiu jitsu working out it's awesome to say thank you and if you have kids or you
[01:39:05] no kids get them on that same path if you want to support a warrior kid go to irishokes ranch.com
[01:39:12] and get some soap made by the warrior kid aiden because you know you need to see soap if you are going
[01:39:20] to stay clean don't forget about the discipline you could free them field manual same thing
[01:39:25] awesome feedback you ever heard the saying an apple a day keeps the doctor away yes not really
[01:39:33] read one section of the field manual a day I know it doesn't rhyme but it actually works
[01:39:37] it doesn't it'll keep you on track physically and mentally and if you want to speak
[01:39:44] of tracks you want to listen to it there's no audio audible version of it because we wanted
[01:39:49] to have an album with tracks you can get it on amazon news at google play iTunes other MP3
[01:39:59] platforms the discipline equals field the discipline equals freedom field manual meditate on that
[01:40:09] all right also for leadership extreme ownership combat leadership
[01:40:15] how is this book still a best seller after two and a half years that's the question
[01:40:20] and lathe was telling a guy the other day on twitter he's like it's the same thing
[01:40:25] as when we first started working together and i talked about something and how to do something
[01:40:29] and he'd be like yeah it works and that's why the book is still selling because
[01:40:34] it works and and right now speaking of it works you can order the follow on book to
[01:40:39] extreme ownership it's called the dichotomy of leadership the manuscript is done
[01:40:46] it is now going through the pentagon review process and i'm telling you lathe and i are
[01:40:52] both super stoked on the information that's in it the stories that are in it the word that's in it
[01:41:01] where amazon barns noble your local book store and if you do that it lets our publisher know
