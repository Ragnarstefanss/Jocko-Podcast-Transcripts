00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.28 This is jockel podcast number 260 with echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening. I go good evening
00:00:09.84 --> 00:00:11.84 So
00:00:11.84 --> 00:00:14.48 I was in my
00:00:14.80 --> 00:00:16.80 bedroom
00:00:18.96 --> 00:00:22.28 Sitting on my bed and I was
00:00:23.96 --> 00:00:25.96 Renching in pain
00:00:25.96 --> 00:00:33.96 or I guess the proper word is anguish it had been two days
00:00:35.80 --> 00:00:37.80 Since Seth died
00:00:41.40 --> 00:00:45.88 And the the five stages of grief were not kind to me
00:00:45.88 --> 00:00:53.88 The first stage of grief denial was over in about 15 seconds
00:00:58.20 --> 00:01:01.24 I've had so many friends die that
00:01:04.12 --> 00:01:06.52 I know without question what it means
00:01:10.20 --> 00:01:12.20 I know how quickly it comes
00:01:12.20 --> 00:01:18.52 And I know that my friends in our line of work including Seth
00:01:22.28 --> 00:01:24.92 We dance with death all the time
00:01:29.48 --> 00:01:36.36 And just a day prior one of my friends and mentors in the seal teams master chief Mike faculty had died
00:01:36.36 --> 00:01:47.92 And all this was taking place right on the 11th anniversary of Mikey Montsoura being killed in action in Ramadi on September 29th
00:01:47.92 --> 00:01:50.28 2006. So denial didn't last long
00:01:51.16 --> 00:01:53.16 and
00:01:55.40 --> 00:01:59.000 Neither did the the so called bargaining stage
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.76 because I know there's no
00:02:06.44 --> 00:02:08.44 There's no bargaining with death
00:02:12.76 --> 00:02:19.40 I know what it is. I know it is irreversible irrevocable and I know it's 100% final
00:02:19.40 --> 00:02:25.96 which
00:02:27.80 --> 00:02:29.16 brought me to the next two stages
00:02:31.64 --> 00:02:31.96 which
00:02:34.60 --> 00:02:36.60 hit me at the same time part
00:02:39.96 --> 00:02:43.88 Working together in unison to torment me
00:02:43.88 --> 00:02:47.64 anger and depression
00:02:50.60 --> 00:03:00.28 So that's what I'm feeling sitting there in agony and the walls are closing in and the darkness is taking over my brain and I can actually see it happening
00:03:00.28 --> 00:03:09.72 I was talking about being detached so I'm I'm detached and I can see it happening and doesn't feel like there's anything I could do about it
00:03:14.12 --> 00:03:14.76 I see
00:03:14.76 --> 00:03:27.24 I see hope and I see the the fun and the joy and the laughter and I see life circling the drain
00:03:30.36 --> 00:03:32.36 and I know it's bad and I know
00:03:34.60 --> 00:03:36.60 I know where that leads
00:03:36.60 --> 00:03:42.12 I know that that's the beginning of the downward spiral
00:03:46.76 --> 00:03:50.28 Then I can feel my mind getting sucked into that vortex
00:03:57.96 --> 00:03:59.000 and I don't know what to do
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.64 and from my bed
00:04:07.08 --> 00:04:12.04 you can see through the door to my office and I look into my office
00:04:13.40 --> 00:04:15.48 and I see a book and it's a book that I actually wrote
00:04:17.40 --> 00:04:19.56 the book that hadn't even been released yet
00:04:20.28 --> 00:04:22.28 it was about to be released
00:04:22.28 --> 00:04:27.56 but I had received my
00:04:27.56 --> 00:04:32.76 box of copies from the publisher and there was a stack of those books sitting on my desk
00:04:40.28 --> 00:04:40.84 and I
00:04:42.20 --> 00:04:42.84 I remembered
00:04:44.60 --> 00:04:47.96 that's like my own book was talking to me because I remembered
00:04:47.96 --> 00:04:53.000 that I had written about death in that book and when I had written about death
00:04:55.16 --> 00:04:57.64 I had written it for other people
00:04:59.16 --> 00:05:03.40 because I experienced a lot of loss, lost a lot of friends
00:05:05.48 --> 00:05:11.16 so I was writing about death so other people could learn from me because I felt like I was good
00:05:11.16 --> 00:05:17.80 and I knew how to handle death
00:05:20.36 --> 00:05:25.80 except at that moment in time I wasn't handling it too well at all
00:05:31.16 --> 00:05:35.000 so I picked up the book
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.72 I picked up the book that I had written
00:05:41.72 --> 00:05:45.32 I picked up the book and opened it to a section
00:05:47.32 --> 00:05:49.72 to read the words that I had written myself
00:05:55.32 --> 00:05:55.96 and I read it
00:05:55.96 --> 00:06:02.60 the section is called death
00:06:07.48 --> 00:06:13.08 and it says how does good apply to the worst of losses the death of a loved one
00:06:15.48 --> 00:06:18.12 it's easy to think that there's nothing good in death
00:06:18.12 --> 00:06:24.36 but then I remember that people I have lost throughout my life
00:06:26.12 --> 00:06:32.60 the memories of them, the experiences, the fun, their unique personalities and everything they gave me
00:06:35.88 --> 00:06:38.36 not only in their life but in their death
00:06:41.96 --> 00:06:45.48 what their life taught me and what their death taught me
00:06:45.48 --> 00:06:48.52 the mark they had left on me
00:06:53.80 --> 00:06:56.04 and I realized there is good
00:06:57.96 --> 00:07:04.44 even in death there is good first of all I was lucky enough to have had that person in my life
00:07:04.44 --> 00:07:06.60 even if it was only for a short time
00:07:06.60 --> 00:07:08.52 two short of time at least I got that
00:07:08.52 --> 00:07:16.36 those moments, those precious moments, those unforgettable memories
00:07:16.36 --> 00:07:20.20 at least I got those and got to experience those times
00:07:20.20 --> 00:07:24.84 to know the beauty of their personality, their attitude, their outlook on the world
00:07:24.84 --> 00:07:36.92 they were all unique and I am thankful for the opportunity I had to interact with them
00:07:38.76 --> 00:07:43.88 now comes death, death is horrible and death is wretched and death is cruel
00:07:46.36 --> 00:07:47.72 and death isn't fair
00:07:47.72 --> 00:07:54.28 and I don't know why the best people seem to be taken from us first
00:07:57.88 --> 00:07:59.80 death is also inescapable
00:08:02.28 --> 00:08:06.76 there is no way out no one gets out alive
00:08:06.76 --> 00:08:17.32 death is part of life like the contrast between the darkness and the light
00:08:21.32 --> 00:08:25.64 without death there is no life
00:08:25.64 --> 00:08:35.000 and the people that I have lost they taught me that
00:08:38.28 --> 00:08:46.44 they taught me how precious life is, how blessed we are to have every day to learn, to grow, to laugh, to live
00:08:46.44 --> 00:09:01.40 to live, to live every day with purpose and passion to wake up in the morning and be thankful
00:09:01.40 --> 00:09:08.04 thankful for that morning, thankful for that opportunity to go into the world and live
00:09:08.04 --> 00:09:20.36 live for them, for those that don't have the opportunity, for those who are stolen away by death's cruel hand
00:09:20.36 --> 00:09:34.84 for them I will live, I will revere their memory and I will live
00:09:34.84 --> 00:09:44.84 live
00:09:44.84 --> 00:09:49.40 let us cry no more let us mourn no more let us remember
00:09:51.16 --> 00:09:52.84 but let us not dwell
00:09:52.84 --> 00:10:07.80 instead let us laugh and love and let us embrace and venerate everything that life is and every
00:10:07.80 --> 00:10:17.96 opportunity it gives us let us live for those who live no more
00:10:17.96 --> 00:10:24.76 let us live 200 them
00:10:24.76 --> 00:10:47.80 and that is what I tried to do then that is what I am still trying to do
00:10:47.80 --> 00:10:58.12 but I needed that bit of guidance from myself
00:11:03.64 --> 00:11:10.68 and there is even more backstory here because the book was supposed to come out
00:11:10.68 --> 00:11:19.72 October 17th 2017 that is when the book was being released and for that release of the book
00:11:20.76 --> 00:11:26.92 I had nine days of media scheduled in New York City with all the cable news networks and
00:11:26.92 --> 00:11:31.88 the syndicated radio interviews and the articles and the podcast interviews and all the stuff was set up
00:11:31.88 --> 00:11:41.000 and scheduled so people would hear about the book and of course all this stuff is what the
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.80 publisher and the public sets up because they're trying to sell the book and it's the big chance
00:11:45.80 --> 00:11:51.16 to get on the New York Times bestseller list and the Wall Street Journal bestseller list and the USA
00:11:51.16 --> 00:11:56.76 today list and the Amazon list and all that and of course I know that because of the situation none
00:11:56.76 --> 00:12:04.36 of this is going to happen I know that I have to take care of my friend I have to see him off
00:12:04.36 --> 00:12:13.48 and I didn't take care of his mom and his dad and his brother and his sister so the entire nine
00:12:13.48 --> 00:12:17.16 days of media got completely canceled I did zero
00:12:17.16 --> 00:12:29.48 didn't even do my own podcast about this book in fact that's the only week where this podcast
00:12:29.48 --> 00:12:42.84 did not come out and I went to three memorial services for Seth and to his burial at
00:12:42.84 --> 00:12:48.12 Fort Rose Crans National Cemetery there was a memorial service in San Diego for the teams
00:12:50.92 --> 00:12:57.56 there was one in Houston his hometown for his Texas friends and family and there was one in
00:12:57.56 --> 00:13:02.52 Hawaii which was the location of the unit that he was attached to when he died
00:13:02.52 --> 00:13:18.84 and I had the honor of escorting his mom throughout all these events as he Seth had requested
00:13:20.28 --> 00:13:22.28 in a letter he had sent in case he died
00:13:22.28 --> 00:13:31.88 and we saw him off as best we could
00:13:36.20 --> 00:13:48.60 including going surfing and including setting something on fire at dusk which he had also requested
00:13:48.60 --> 00:13:53.40 in that letter and we burned what was left of an old surfboard that Seth had given to my
00:13:53.40 --> 00:14:02.28 son which my son had broken and we also burned an old guitar of mine that could not be tuned
00:14:05.16 --> 00:14:09.32 at least no one could tune it except for Seth somehow he could tune up a no one else could so
00:14:09.32 --> 00:14:16.68 it was of no use anymore so we set them aflame in a giant bonfire on the beach near our favorite
00:14:16.68 --> 00:14:25.88 surf spot and we push the burning surfboard out to see Viking style
00:14:32.04 --> 00:14:33.000 and we say goodbye
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.80 but we will remember
00:14:41.80 --> 00:15:03.000 now what made me think about all this is that the other day I got asked a question someone asked me
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.20 what your favorite mantra
00:15:04.20 --> 00:15:10.28 and of course when I when I think of mantras
00:15:12.44 --> 00:15:20.20 I think of the generic and I guess cheesy is the word for lack of a better word
00:15:21.96 --> 00:15:26.04 mantras that you hear that if you can believe it you can achieve it or
00:15:26.76 --> 00:15:31.80 or you know failure is part of the road to success or whatever whatever those things are
00:15:31.80 --> 00:15:36.84 the standard kind of mantras nothing against them but they're not really
00:15:38.04 --> 00:15:41.24 they're not really my things so this person asked me what's my favorite mantra and I say you
00:15:41.24 --> 00:15:44.92 know I'm not I'm not really into the whole mantra thing I don't really say anything to myself I just
00:15:44.92 --> 00:15:52.04 I just do what I do and this was on a call and and Jamie who is the operations director
00:15:52.04 --> 00:15:55.88 Deschalant front and she's also an instructor and she was on the call as well and she kind of
00:15:55.88 --> 00:16:06.20 chimed in to tighten me up with my answer she said she said jacco she said everything you say
00:16:07.32 --> 00:16:13.88 is a mantra you speak in mantras maybe not to yourself but the rest of us you speak in mantras and I
00:16:13.88 --> 00:16:18.44 thought about that for about a quarter of a second and I realize that she was absolutely right
00:16:18.44 --> 00:16:26.60 discipline equals freedom yes that's a mantra and I absolutely live by that
00:16:28.52 --> 00:16:32.92 good that's a mantra stay on the path that's a mantra
00:16:35.48 --> 00:16:39.72 and not only do I say these things but I actually wrote a book filled with these mantras
00:16:39.72 --> 00:16:50.12 and the title of the book is actually the mantra itself discipline equals freedom
00:16:49.000 --> 00:17:00.36 then not only that but I realized that even though I'm saying oh you don't need a mantra I need them
00:17:01.08 --> 00:17:02.20 at least sometimes
00:17:02.20 --> 00:17:15.88 sometimes like I had when it's said I needed to hear or I needed to read my own words
00:17:15.88 --> 00:17:20.20 to get me through to figure out where to go to figure out what to do
00:17:20.20 --> 00:17:34.68 well the rest of the cool part of the back stories that when the book came out it came out with no
00:17:34.68 --> 00:17:41.88 media at all it still made all those lists because you all supported it but I never covered it on the podcast
00:17:41.88 --> 00:17:51.64 and I never explained what it actually is what the book is where it came from and I just
00:17:51.64 --> 00:17:59.48 released a new version of it so I forget I better tell you and what the book is it's like an operating
00:17:59.48 --> 00:18:07.80 system well yes it's like my operating system and I originally wrote it I originally wrote it
00:18:07.80 --> 00:18:14.36 because people were asking me the same questions all the time about the same subject about jiu-jitsu
00:18:14.36 --> 00:18:20.12 and about diet and about workouts and how to overcome obstacles or how to handle defeat or failure
00:18:20.12 --> 00:18:25.16 or whatever all the same questions so I said you know what I'm just going to my original plan was and I
00:18:25.16 --> 00:18:30.12 said it on the podcast and I still get I still get messages about this what I said on the podcast
00:18:30.12 --> 00:18:33.64 is that look you all are asking me a bunch of these questions I'm just going to publish a quick
00:18:33.64 --> 00:18:38.84 ebook I'll get it together in a few weeks and get it out there and so I actually told my publisher
00:18:38.84 --> 00:18:42.52 hey I'm going to publish a little ebook about this stuff in my publisher said no no please don't do that
00:18:43.24 --> 00:18:48.68 do not publish an ebook please said you just you just were the number one New York times best
00:18:48.68 --> 00:18:56.68 selling author you don't publish an ebook well what I told them was well sorry but I'm going to
00:18:56.68 --> 00:19:02.92 I'm going to just do this as an ebook because I don't want you to tell me what has to be in there
00:19:02.92 --> 00:19:07.80 how long it has to be or what it needs to look like or any of that stuff I want to do whatever
00:19:07.80 --> 00:19:10.60 I want to do and the only way I can do whatever I want to do is if I just do it myself
00:19:13.32 --> 00:19:17.08 and I was looking into how we're going to get this thing printed so I had a vision in my mind
00:19:17.08 --> 00:19:24.04 I knew what I wanted the book to to be and my publisher to his credit and maybe to his own
00:19:25.40 --> 00:19:31.64 possible mistake said I will publish whatever you want and I said really
00:19:31.64 --> 00:19:40.44 and he said whatever you want so that's what this book is it's not a normal book if you haven't seen it
00:19:40.44 --> 00:19:47.64 before it's not a normal book the way it's written the the format of it the way it's laid out the
00:19:48.28 --> 00:19:56.20 I guess what is it the color of the pages it's just a different it's a whole different scenario
00:19:56.20 --> 00:20:05.80 of a book and well I guess if we want to learn a little bit about the book there is a visual
00:20:05.80 --> 00:20:12.12 impact to the book echo channels is there yes there is it's a really hard to print
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.68 you know because instead of being white pages with like simple black letters there's all these
00:20:17.48 --> 00:20:23.32 images in the background of every single page most of the images are black and then the writing
00:20:23.32 --> 00:20:31.000 is almost all in white so it's a different book has a different visual impact it's cool some people
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.76 send me pictures of they'll just have this book sitting somewhere it's sort you know just kind of
00:20:36.76 --> 00:20:43.000 have it in its position so so let's go to the book I'll I'll read through some of the stuff
00:20:44.20 --> 00:20:52.52 the the opening section is called the way of discipline people look for the shortcut the hack
00:20:52.52 --> 00:20:58.60 and if you came here looking for that you won't find it the shortcut is a lie the hack doesn't
00:20:58.60 --> 00:21:02.92 get you there and if you want to take the easy road it won't take you where you want to be
00:21:03.72 --> 00:21:08.52 stronger smarter faster healthier better free
00:21:10.36 --> 00:21:16.60 to reach goals and overcome obstacles and be the best version of you possible will not happen by itself
00:21:16.60 --> 00:21:24.84 it will not happen cutting corners taking shortcuts or looking for the easy way there is no easy way
00:21:26.44 --> 00:21:33.56 there is only hard work late nights early mornings practice rehearsal repetition study sweat
00:21:33.56 --> 00:21:45.24 blood toil frustration and discipline discipline there must be discipline discipline the route of all
00:21:45.24 --> 00:21:52.36 good qualities the driver of daily execution the core principle that overcomes laziness and
00:21:52.36 --> 00:22:03.16 lethargy and excuses discipline defeats the infinite excuses that say not today not now I need a
00:22:03.16 --> 00:22:11.88 rest I will do tomorrow what's the hack how do you become stronger smarter faster healthier how
00:22:11.88 --> 00:22:20.20 do you become better how do you achieve true freedom there is only one way the way of discipline
00:22:22.92 --> 00:22:29.24 so that's the opening of the book you know this is not there's not a this is not a verbose book
00:22:30.60 --> 00:22:37.56 you don't get paid by the word like the old newspaper writers you should get paid by the word
00:22:37.56 --> 00:22:45.32 not getting paid by the word trying to say what I'm trying to say that's it so so that that is from the
00:22:45.32 --> 00:22:52.44 first section of this book and the first section of this book is called thoughts and then the second section
00:22:52.44 --> 00:22:59.72 is called actions and the action sections includes three parts one is fuel one is
00:22:59.72 --> 00:23:08.28 one is repair and maintenance and one is the workouts so let me give you some more of these thoughts
00:23:09.88 --> 00:23:21.80 this one's called overcoming procrastination when and where to start people want to know how to
00:23:21.80 --> 00:23:27.64 stop laziness they want to know how to stop procrastination they have an idea in their head maybe
00:23:27.64 --> 00:23:33.80 even a vision but they don't know where to start so they ask and they say where do I start when
00:23:33.80 --> 00:23:43.000 is the best time to start and I have a simple answer here and now that's it you want to improve
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000 you want to get better you want to get on a workout program or a clean diet or start a new
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.20 business you want to write a book or make a movie or build a house or a computer or an app
00:23:52.20 --> 00:24:00.92 where do you start you start right here when do you start you start right now you initiate action you go
00:24:02.68 --> 00:24:09.08 here is the reality the idea isn't going to execute itself that book isn't going to write
00:24:09.08 --> 00:24:14.12 itself those weights out in the gym they aren't going to move themselves you have to do it
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.56 and you have to do it now so stop thinking about it stop dreaming about it stop researching
00:24:21.56 --> 00:24:26.76 every aspect of it and reading all about it and debating the pros and cons of it start doing it
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:37.88 take that first step and make it happen get after it here and now you've been kind of getting
00:24:37.88 --> 00:24:44.84 after it lately haven't you? you made a goal you were telling me you have goals is this lens of
00:24:44.84 --> 00:24:52.92 is this kind of a new I think it's it was a progressive kind of thing it started with kind of certain
00:24:52.92 --> 00:24:59.16 things you know remember I told you I got a not a journal but what do you call like a planner?
00:24:59.16 --> 00:25:06.36 yeah you got the day planner and I've tried the planner thing many times but not like the one that you
00:25:06.36 --> 00:25:13.08 actually write in with a pencil okay you know the kind like online I got my digital my phone you know
00:25:13.08 --> 00:25:18.60 yeah it's a weird thing there's a weird thing that happens when you go physical I right yes for me
00:25:18.60 --> 00:25:23.000 that was the case for sure I could some people that's how like if you go did they got their cool app
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.68 organizer app whatever and it works apparently you know a lot of people use it so you know you can't
00:25:28.68 --> 00:25:35.32 try to kind of can't refute that yeah but it didn't work for me like it didn't stick at all many many times you know
00:25:35.32 --> 00:25:39.40 I even did on the computer where I was like oh I'm gonna and I'm leaving on the desktop so I can
00:25:39.40 --> 00:25:45.16 all we see it and we'll still like it worked for certain things but not for like not for like making
00:25:45.16 --> 00:25:52.20 a bunch of videos for this but it was stuff that I would always have to revisit mentally you know
00:25:52.20 --> 00:25:56.92 and I'd be like okay it's open okay there it is there but no yeah now for clients I got a planner
00:25:56.92 --> 00:26:02.84 and a pencil a special pencil for the planner oh mechanical pencil yeah I'm a big mechanical pencil
00:26:02.84 --> 00:26:07.24 guy yeah because you can write you can write super small you need to like man yeah it's good
00:26:07.24 --> 00:26:11.88 and then you can erase it anyway so it started with that like months ago almost here really
00:26:12.44 --> 00:26:17.72 and that helped because it's interesting as I read this book you know right now and as I was
00:26:17.72 --> 00:26:24.36 reviewing it I was thinking about you because you've been kind of like almost involuntarily put on the
00:26:24.36 --> 00:26:30.04 path I guess it's like I mean you just been overexposed I mean just there's no way for you to kind of
00:26:30.04 --> 00:26:37.000 not I mean you're sitting here for hundreds and hundreds of hours yeah so your life has transformed
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.68 in many ways yeah big time it's funny okay here's a quick story not de-gate too much but I'm kind
00:26:42.68 --> 00:26:48.52 of so my daughter she's the kind like she likes certain things and then certain things she just
00:26:48.52 --> 00:26:54.60 straight up doesn't like so you make her start running laps hard so like that kind of stuff so
00:26:54.60 --> 00:27:02.92 we took her you know it was it was my nephew slash son we you took him to a running
00:27:02.92 --> 00:27:09.16 coach and yeah and this coach has a group of kids all bearing levels all the way up until like
00:27:09.16 --> 00:27:15.000 guys getting full ride scholarships to like Oregon for lacrosse like the like high level
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.52 athlete that's a good runner who the coach no who oh Jason yeah we don't know that's the
00:27:22.52 --> 00:27:26.60 thing we don't know so we you know and he had some friends in there and stuff like that so
00:27:26.60 --> 00:27:31.40 they were like hey come and see this coach and all this stuff former marine by the way older guy
00:27:31.40 --> 00:27:36.92 and uh and there's a bunch of kids there and they're all doing their things so I'm like yeah let's
00:27:36.92 --> 00:27:41.96 through my daughter and there too she's seven but young kid you know and there were a couple
00:27:41.96 --> 00:27:45.96 of other young boys in there eight is you know and I'm like she's not kind of like this if this
00:27:45.96 --> 00:27:52.52 is hard conditioning like track practice which it was by the way um it's it's she's not gonna
00:27:52.52 --> 00:27:56.84 like this stuff she's gonna be whatever and she did start crying at one point but she did everything
00:27:56.84 --> 00:28:01.08 that's the thing okay so the point is how I wound up on the path even though I got a mid
00:28:01.08 --> 00:28:07.72 like I've always wanted to like improve but let's face it I go with the wave man and sometimes
00:28:07.72 --> 00:28:13.96 beneficial something and a lot of times not for sure but I watched her and she was nervous she's not
00:28:13.96 --> 00:28:20.68 used to this kind like intensity you know and this guy is the coach he's really cool man he's he's
00:28:21.32 --> 00:28:26.36 but he's not mellow he's making jokes he's putting you down all jokes he can totally tell but
00:28:26.36 --> 00:28:33.000 you know she didn't know what to make of that and so but meanwhile all the kids are listening so
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.84 he's like oh right now you know this kind of and the kids are just going so she has kind of no
00:28:36.84 --> 00:28:43.40 choice but to follow the wave you know if it was me and her by herself at any given moment should be like
00:28:43.40 --> 00:28:47.64 wait I don't want to do that I want to do that but when everyone else is doing it her whole
00:28:47.64 --> 00:28:54.36 at that moment environment is just react or moving but you get caught up in that wave it's kind of
00:28:54.36 --> 00:29:01.72 interesting because you you use the same metaphor for both for two opposite things you said you
00:29:01.72 --> 00:29:06.36 well you know I want to get better but you know sometimes it's kind of go with the wave right exactly
00:29:06.36 --> 00:29:10.60 and now the sudden you're saying that in this situation depending on the direction of the wave
00:29:10.60 --> 00:29:15.56 the wave is going in a good direction you kind of get caught that's what I feel like you you know
00:29:15.56 --> 00:29:20.52 you hanging out with me for the last five years by the way of just the podcast because we've been
00:29:20.52 --> 00:29:25.40 hanging out for a lot longer than that and look let's face it you had a lot of elements of
00:29:26.04 --> 00:29:30.44 of discipline and hard work I mean you you you played football obviously you got a hard work
00:29:30.44 --> 00:29:37.08 do that you know you you're awesome at jujitsu you're you know you you obviously work out hard
00:29:37.08 --> 00:29:41.56 so you have like some aspects in your life that were real kind of strong some other aspects
00:29:41.56 --> 00:29:48.76 your life we had some areas we could have improved we had a little bit more on the path they
00:29:48.76 --> 00:29:54.36 wouldn't they want to kind of write a different wave yes so yeah it's cool yeah that that wave is
00:29:54.36 --> 00:29:59.32 powerful like you know they say and there's a bunch of cool quote unquote cool tag lines where it's like
00:29:59.32 --> 00:30:03.88 oh you you're network is your net worth and like all this and basically they're awesome that's
00:30:03.88 --> 00:30:06.68 see that's what somebody asked me like what's your favorite mantra I started thinking of all those
00:30:06.68 --> 00:30:11.08 things and I was like oh you know what I'm not gonna get I'm not gonna get here and Jamie was like
00:30:11.08 --> 00:30:15.24 she typed me up she's like hey jocke what everything you say is a fontra on my she's like
00:30:15.24 --> 00:30:20.92 you might not you might not think it but we all think it's true and all sorts of the truth and
00:30:20.92 --> 00:30:25.48 and those monsters even the quote unquote cheesy ones they all root the root of all of them are
00:30:25.48 --> 00:30:31.88 legitimate yeah they're not untrue yeah and some of them are absolutely like yes 100% yeah
00:30:31.88 --> 00:30:37.32 and these network is your net work and like show me your five friends I'll show you the
00:30:37.32 --> 00:30:41.08 future or whatever like all that they're all saying the same thing it's kind of like your
00:30:41.08 --> 00:30:45.48 environment is this big wave that's gonna influence you and you're gonna be writing that thing
00:30:45.48 --> 00:30:48.84 and you can fight against it you can write away that you can do whatever you want to do but
00:30:48.84 --> 00:30:53.16 rather that's a wave you might want to pick the right wave but if you pick the right wave you're good
00:30:53.16 --> 00:30:58.04 but me in this case I kind of a way didn't really pick any wave at all I'm essentially
00:30:58.68 --> 00:31:03.88 wrote one wave right into another wave and luckily that wave was going in the right direction and it
00:31:03.88 --> 00:31:08.92 was huge it is huge so yeah and I was down for it so yeah man I'm writing it and you know trying
00:31:08.92 --> 00:31:15.40 to do the right things for sure and yes very very beneficial check this next section
00:31:17.16 --> 00:31:21.56 I'm gonna jump through a bunch of these real quick but this one's called the person you can control
00:31:23.40 --> 00:31:29.000 people are not who you want them to be kill your idols sure there are things we can learn from
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.44 people but people aren't going to be what you think they are what they should be
00:31:34.44 --> 00:31:40.20 people even those people you have put on a pedestal are going to be falted week
00:31:40.20 --> 00:31:46.12 ego maniacal condescending they are going to be lazy entitled short-sighted
00:31:46.76 --> 00:31:50.68 they will be they will not be perfect far from it that's fine
00:31:51.96 --> 00:31:57.16 learn from their weaknesses of course learn from their strengths and mimic and copy them
00:31:57.16 --> 00:32:03.88 and what they do well but equally as important learn from their faults see what not to do
00:32:05.32 --> 00:32:11.72 because you can't control other people you can't make them what you want them to be you can't make
00:32:11.72 --> 00:32:20.84 them who you want them to be the only person you can control is you so focus on making yourself
00:32:20.84 --> 00:32:28.60 who you want to be faster stronger smarter more humble less ego discipline your body free your mind
00:32:28.60 --> 00:32:34.20 get up early and go get after it and you'll become the person you want to be and you become
00:32:34.20 --> 00:32:39.000 that person through one small decision at a time
00:32:41.64 --> 00:32:44.12 yeah as you can see this is a book of mantras
00:32:44.12 --> 00:32:52.20 yes and then but it's not all that it's also there's also some you know there's actually a
00:32:52.20 --> 00:32:59.40 bunch of pragmatic information here's one section like that stress first of all and I don't
00:32:59.40 --> 00:33:05.40 mean to minimize the stress people face but imagine what Eugene's sled went through on
00:33:05.40 --> 00:33:11.08 Pelaloo and the tens of thousands of marines there who suffered unimaginable horror
00:33:11.08 --> 00:33:16.92 imagine what David Hacworth imagine David Hacworth assaulting enemy positions in Korea wounded
00:33:16.92 --> 00:33:21.96 over and over again on the line still going back for more imagine a poet warrior
00:33:21.96 --> 00:33:27.08 Alan Seeger and World War I getting ready to go over the top and make his rendezvous with death
00:33:28.28 --> 00:33:34.52 imagine the thousands of warriors who have gone before you who have stood and faced evil and death
00:33:34.52 --> 00:33:43.96 and now imagine you I used to do this myself while in Iraq facing stress yes we took casualties
00:33:43.96 --> 00:33:47.88 and yes it was awful and heartbreaking and every bit is wretched as I could imagine
00:33:47.88 --> 00:33:54.76 but warriors have faced much much worse the battle of the Psalm or getty's bird or the battle
00:33:54.76 --> 00:34:00.76 of the bulge or the chosen reservoir Hugh humans can withstand almost inconceivable stress
00:34:00.76 --> 00:34:10.76 and you can too so that is your first step gain perspective and to do that you must do something
00:34:10.76 --> 00:34:17.08 critical in many situations detach whatever problems or stress you are experiencing detach from them
00:34:18.12 --> 00:34:25.16 stresses generally caused by what you can't control the worst thing about incoming artillery fire
00:34:25.16 --> 00:34:30.52 is you can't control it it is happening and you just have to accept it don't stress about things
00:34:30.52 --> 00:34:39.000 you can't control if the stress is something that you can control and you are not that is a lack of
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.76 discipline and a lack of ownership get control of it impose your will to make it happen solve the
00:34:44.76 --> 00:34:54.52 problem relieve the stress if the stress is something you can't control in brace it you can't control
00:34:54.52 --> 00:34:58.60 it but how can you look at it from a different angle how can you use it to your advantage I
00:34:58.60 --> 00:35:03.48 couldn't control the chaos of combat I had to embrace it I had to figure out a way to take advantage of it
00:35:04.04 --> 00:35:11.24 make it into your ally so don't fight stress embrace it turn it on itself use it to make yourself
00:35:11.24 --> 00:35:18.68 sharper and more alert use it to make you think and learn and get better and smarter and more effective
00:35:18.68 --> 00:35:31.64 use the stress to make you better this is one this is one that you know I I kind of have to go over this
00:35:31.64 --> 00:35:36.52 one and it's it's again there's a bunch of these and they're all very short like this or
00:35:37.24 --> 00:35:42.68 within these types of lengths it's kind of thing you can read for three minutes before you start your
00:35:42.68 --> 00:35:50.92 day before you work out before you go to bed at night maybe that might not be the best idea
00:35:50.92 --> 00:35:54.76 because if you treat you know you might start getting the ideas in your head and I have a real problem
00:35:54.76 --> 00:36:00.28 with that like I have ideas in my head if I have ideas in my head do you have your do you ever can't sleep
00:36:00.28 --> 00:36:08.12 is that ever happening why you got it I just wonder is that a thing it doesn't seem like you be
00:36:08.12 --> 00:36:13.48 like common at me with like a little trouble sleeping right it seems like you fully embrace sleeping like I might
00:36:13.48 --> 00:36:23.000 embrace stress yes yeah dance your way yeah I'm in before that reason for sure so you get a cool idea
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.44 you can't wait like I can't wait to see a cool idea the thing that's kind of cool about you though is
00:36:28.44 --> 00:36:33.88 if you get a good idea at midnight you can just get up and start working on it and sleep until 10
00:36:33.88 --> 00:36:43.000 yes no fact me I got you like you have I think you don't have any schedule really of any kind
00:36:45.72 --> 00:36:53.24 not as far as regular schedule stuff no so other people have things that they have to do in my
00:36:53.24 --> 00:37:07.24 fun to do it yeah yeah so so this one this is not the kind of things that you want to read like
00:37:07.24 --> 00:37:11.80 right before you go to bed maybe because for me what happens it's the weirdest thing it's
00:37:12.84 --> 00:37:18.04 I've never done a psychedelic drug before but it kind of feels like a psychedelic drug where
00:37:18.04 --> 00:37:24.20 my mind is going down paths like I'm thinking about something and I can feel it like you know
00:37:24.20 --> 00:37:28.12 when I like a special of like an old school special effect when you go through some like space
00:37:28.12 --> 00:37:34.52 tunnel like a place time tunnel or something or something like a normal thing so I'll be doing that
00:37:34.52 --> 00:37:41.32 and then all of a sudden it'll go like a roller coaster off to a side and go down all
00:37:41.32 --> 00:37:45.80 I'll go down some other what you call it what I go down some other wormhole of thought but then
00:37:45.80 --> 00:37:50.20 it just branches off and it just keeps going so my it's like I'm going to a thousand miles an hour
00:37:50.20 --> 00:37:56.36 inside my own head then you there's no way I can sleep yeah I can see how that could be yeah
00:37:56.36 --> 00:38:00.76 it's it's a bummer so I would say use a little caution if you're going to read them before you
00:38:00.76 --> 00:38:05.96 go to bed I would more read them in the morning I would more you know read them during the day
00:38:06.52 --> 00:38:11.32 have the books sit now have it you know like in a place where you're thinking about it
00:38:11.32 --> 00:38:15.72 and you can pick it up sometimes here's here's what here's what I called compromise
00:38:15.72 --> 00:38:20.12 when working with other people and dynamic situations and relationships and deals a person
00:38:20.12 --> 00:38:24.76 especially a leader must compromise finding the common ground between teams merging different approaches
00:38:24.76 --> 00:38:29.48 to the same problem bridging personalities with people who might not get along reaching
00:38:29.48 --> 00:38:35.24 agreements and courses of action all these require compromise and in many cases a failure to
00:38:35.24 --> 00:38:41.16 compromise is a failure to succeed so so it's important because you know a lot of times people might
00:38:41.16 --> 00:38:46.04 well the not even might a lot of times people have the impression me there's no compromise
00:38:46.04 --> 00:38:49.08 when the reality is like oh what do you want to do that sounds like a good idea let's move
00:38:49.08 --> 00:38:55.24 in that direction as a leader it's you actually have to do that a good leader does that a good
00:38:55.24 --> 00:39:01.08 leader compromise is to a lot of things right of course you're going to have principles and
00:39:01.08 --> 00:39:06.28 values that you can't compromise but those should be small we're not small they're huge but they
00:39:06.28 --> 00:39:11.32 should be a small number of things so going back to the book but those are external
00:39:11.32 --> 00:39:18.36 compromises with other people other humans that have their own personalities and ethos and issues
00:39:18.36 --> 00:39:24.92 and compromise is needed in order to unify so to work with them compromise is a must but
00:39:24.92 --> 00:39:31.96 internally it's different with myself I have to hold the line there are areas within myself
00:39:31.96 --> 00:39:38.60 where I cannot compromise I am going to work hard I am going to train hard I am going to improve
00:39:38.60 --> 00:39:45.96 myself I am going I am not going to rest on my laurels I'm going to own my mistakes and confront
00:39:45.96 --> 00:39:53.72 them I am going to face my demons I am not going to give up or give out or give in I am going to stand
00:39:53.72 --> 00:40:02.60 I am going to maintain myself discipline and on those points there will be no compromise not now
00:40:04.04 --> 00:40:06.04 not ever
00:40:08.60 --> 00:40:12.68 reading that right before I go to sleep probably not going to do it because then I probably
00:40:12.68 --> 00:40:17.48 do a burpees in the corner of the room but it's on a ton of these things
00:40:17.48 --> 00:40:23.56 you know skip through a bunch of them right now there's one that I like in here it's called
00:40:23.56 --> 00:40:27.72 binary code I know you like that because you're a computer expert
00:40:27.72 --> 00:40:36.84 it says machines make their decisions based on binary code yes or no
00:40:38.12 --> 00:40:44.44 it is not complicated are you going to work out yes or no are you going to get up yes or no
00:40:44.44 --> 00:40:50.36 are you going to get off the couch yes or no are you going to eat that donut yes or no this is not
00:40:50.36 --> 00:40:58.92 complicated and sometimes you have to put yourself into this mode binary decision making
00:41:00.04 --> 00:41:05.16 are you going to be weak or strong are you going to be healthier unhealthy are you going to improve
00:41:05.16 --> 00:41:11.000 your life are you going to make it worse are you going to sacrifice long term success for shirt short
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:19.48 term gratification you know the right answers you know the right decisions don't over complicate
00:41:21.48 --> 00:41:30.20 binary decision making make the right decisions that's your whole dealer it's kind of it's
00:41:30.20 --> 00:41:35.72 kind of like part you know that mode there and it's more about yourself though I think like with other
00:41:35.72 --> 00:41:41.000 people that's the thing that's the thing let's so strange about this is this stuff rings so true in my
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.52 head for me but like with other people as a leader interacting in relationships like this doesn't
00:41:48.52 --> 00:41:55.96 work yeah that's weird but yeah when it comes to stuff that like you're talking to me honest like
00:41:55.96 --> 00:42:01.80 like with me like even just like the look you know like a fall you know I tend to from time to time
00:42:01.80 --> 00:42:08.76 whatever go down certain over explanations and like all this stuff whatever and you're looking at
00:42:08.76 --> 00:42:13.80 me with the zero like a straight up zero almost like it's literally zero what's a zero you know
00:42:13.80 --> 00:42:17.64 you got the one and you got the zero all right you're super good you know you're assuming
00:42:17.64 --> 00:42:23.24 yeah I got it um and the value of your statement to zero I got it
00:42:25.24 --> 00:42:29.64 you literally look at every like that kind of like oh yeah and here's the thing though that's real
00:42:29.64 --> 00:42:34.52 beneficial to though and that's part of this whole way but I think anyway where you know I'm over here
00:42:34.52 --> 00:42:38.76 you know we're all in our own head from time to time if not all the time whatever and then it's good
00:42:38.76 --> 00:42:44.52 to have that little reflective like situation where I'm saying what's in my head to see how it sort
00:42:44.52 --> 00:42:52.28 of lands on the outside world and when that thing is literally like not computing it all you're like
00:42:52.28 --> 00:42:56.60 all right well I guess I can do a way with that thought you know kind of thing and then you know
00:42:56.60 --> 00:43:01.48 sometimes you'll have like a reaction is okay that's maybe viable whatever and after a while all
00:43:01.48 --> 00:43:07.16 those zeros and ones sort of kind of formulate a little little line of code you know now we can
00:43:07.16 --> 00:43:11.32 go do some things you know kind of thing and and that's kind of like the influence but it's
00:43:11.32 --> 00:43:16.04 interesting how that you put it in that book where you got to get in that mode because you can't
00:43:16.04 --> 00:43:20.12 be like that with everything you know but but sometimes you just get in that mode and you're like
00:43:20.12 --> 00:43:24.12 all right like especially with the workout I mean that's an obvious one where you're like
00:43:24.12 --> 00:43:28.68 right you're gonna work out or not and if you're like later okay so no then are you gonna work
00:43:28.68 --> 00:43:33.16 out right now because that's what the plan was or that's what you were trying to do or whatever
00:43:33.16 --> 00:43:39.64 right and then if you're like on that it's like oh it's real clear you know so yeah man if you can
00:43:39.64 --> 00:43:45.72 get in that mode when you need to either yes or no and you know that's a thing I think to to
00:43:45.72 --> 00:43:53.32 compliment what you're saying when when you take all that gray area you know this is the important
00:43:53.32 --> 00:43:58.28 thing when you take the gray area you know what the right answer is right you can make a lot of things
00:43:58.28 --> 00:44:02.12 that make it seem like there's a whole bunch of different options there but there's really only two
00:44:02.12 --> 00:44:06.84 options you're gonna work out or you're not and all the other little things that you're thinking
00:44:06.84 --> 00:44:12.52 they're they're they're just they're just they're just they're just junk right they're just junk yeah
00:44:13.24 --> 00:44:18.68 that gray area as you mentioned it's like there's so much a danger in there there's so much oil
00:44:18.68 --> 00:44:24.36 and slippery stuff in there but that lead that out there so like okay the workout right
00:44:24.36 --> 00:44:29.96 well it's a big gray area you can throw in there I'll do it later that's one right because the
00:44:29.96 --> 00:44:34.44 fact is you can do it later and get it done straight up kind of you know you got something super
00:44:34.44 --> 00:44:39.32 important like that's a possibility you know but you start throwing that that in there it's like
00:44:39.32 --> 00:44:46.60 oh man that becomes dangerous because I would say if if considering that I'm a normal person
00:44:46.60 --> 00:44:52.68 if I throw in the idea of all do it later the chance of me doing it later goes down way more
00:44:52.68 --> 00:44:57.16 if compared to if I just say hey did it am I gonna do it now or am I not gonna do it and we're
00:44:57.16 --> 00:45:05.56 gonna do it or not gonna do it so if you say if you had three choices do it now do it later
00:45:05.56 --> 00:45:11.40 don't do it the easiest pick is kind of do it later right but do it later doesn't lead the
00:45:11.40 --> 00:45:17.08 execution doesn't lead yeah it doesn't directly lead to execution what's your percentage of when you
00:45:17.08 --> 00:45:21.88 say you'll do it later what's a percentage of execution later well now we're going deeper because
00:45:21.88 --> 00:45:28.44 do it later what does that actually mean how later in an hour later let's say in a in a
00:45:28.44 --> 00:45:37.72 in a window of time that could still be considered part of this scenario yeah you see I would say
00:45:37.72 --> 00:45:43.48 a maximum so my later we got to establish that later as opposed to tomorrow yeah let's
00:45:43.48 --> 00:45:47.64 you miss it work out later is definitely I mean same day in this scenario for it work out we're
00:45:47.64 --> 00:45:53.000 definitely talking about today same day right yeah that's usually like a three four five six
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.96 hour window so if I can so the percentage of me doing it later it's weird because you know maps
00:45:57.96 --> 00:46:02.28 kind of form in your mind so if I don't get it done in the morning like before noon
00:46:02.28 --> 00:46:08.20 because you want to get your lunch or what yeah you work out on an empty stomach yeah so
00:46:08.20 --> 00:46:16.68 damn you too the norm is I don't eat nothing until the work out dinner okay dinner and then
00:46:16.68 --> 00:46:21.16 late dinner that's sort it it wait did you say dinner and late dinner so two dinners yeah
00:46:21.16 --> 00:46:26.12 yeah I didn't dinner with the family shared this with me bruh yeah and then the pre go to bed dinner
00:46:26.12 --> 00:46:32.92 that's interesting but the window how the window goes and it's just a schedule that
00:46:32.92 --> 00:46:37.88 established itself in my mind is a workout during the day or during the morning if I don't do
00:46:37.88 --> 00:46:42.84 that it's a four thirty workout pretty much for thirty across the board that's cool so you put
00:46:42.84 --> 00:46:47.48 a little deadline on yourself kind of that kind of becomes binary right it's either now or it's
00:46:47.48 --> 00:46:52.68 at four thirty yeah yeah that's kind of a good good program yeah what happens at four thirty I work
00:46:52.68 --> 00:46:57.56 out so you're saying get it done later actually you do a good percentage of getting it done later
00:46:57.56 --> 00:47:01.80 yeah but that's gonna make a really good point because technically I did go binary
00:47:01.80 --> 00:47:07.08 in almost like a second level binary situation which starts to become less and less binary
00:47:07.08 --> 00:47:11.88 if it's either now or four thirty yeah so I kind of for me four thirty means a different it means
00:47:11.88 --> 00:47:21.16 twelve hours prior but thirty in the morning but yeah man but again if and I do this naturally
00:47:21.16 --> 00:47:25.48 and it's good to have these kinds like this book or whatever just sort of pointed out for you
00:47:25.48 --> 00:47:32.52 where if I don't get it if I'm not prepping the workout drinking water out there shoes on blah blah
00:47:32.52 --> 00:47:38.68 if that's not happening between four and four thirty if I get to four forty five five
00:47:38.68 --> 00:47:43.08 if it's past five it probably won't happen just because there's other things that the household
00:47:43.08 --> 00:47:51.08 kind of needs me for you know it's so cool that your mind can be so easily
00:47:51.08 --> 00:47:55.32 reset like you're like oh you got this book like if you pick this book up and you're reading it
00:47:56.44 --> 00:48:00.52 you're gonna get it done right I mean you're you're you're you it's gonna hit you
00:48:01.72 --> 00:48:04.68 it's gonna hit you you're gonna you're gonna think yourself you know what that's correct
00:48:04.68 --> 00:48:09.24 I need to go do this I need to control myself I need to make this happen I need to go and
00:48:09.24 --> 00:48:15.000 execute I need to I need to you go in a binary mode and make this happen like you have so much
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:21.80 influence over your brain that's so good if you put your brain on the right wave because if you put it
00:48:21.80 --> 00:48:25.40 on the right wave you're gonna go place if you put it in the wrong wave we're going down down
00:48:25.40 --> 00:48:32.60 the wrong place man we're going in a bad way so you're and it's incredible that you can so easily
00:48:33.64 --> 00:48:37.96 put your well here's the difference you can put your it takes a small bit of effort you pick
00:48:37.96 --> 00:48:45.24 the book this book you read it right you're like oh I'm gonna go get some that took a small amount of effort
00:48:45.24 --> 00:48:50.76 very small amount of effort and it puts you on the right path what strange is if you don't do
00:48:50.76 --> 00:48:55.96 anything we know where it goes right it just kind of the other wave is just kind of there just
00:48:55.96 --> 00:49:00.76 always just pulling it you just drag it and you down yeah it's just constantly there yeah I mean
00:49:00.76 --> 00:49:06.20 the wave analogy is really good respawn on because like if you're in the ocean right you're going
00:49:06.20 --> 00:49:11.56 this way you're going that way you're going there everyone's while you catch a current you know go
00:49:11.56 --> 00:49:15.000 you know kind of in this direction first thing they've been a amount of time or whatever
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.96 or distance and then but by if you get on one of those waves brought you're going full speed you know
00:49:19.96 --> 00:49:25.72 what you can get caught in a rip current you're going out to see like a bad way right you go down
00:49:25.72 --> 00:49:34.28 the downward spiral of horribleness ditching savagery right wrong wave yeah it's true um but I've always
00:49:34.28 --> 00:49:41.72 looked at this book as like I mean it seems like I like I feel like a ferrell manual you know how
00:49:41.72 --> 00:49:47.000 like okay it's called a field man you're like you're right so you know like if if your car has a
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.84 I don't know check engine later I don't know you know whatever some issue with your car and you're
00:49:50.84 --> 00:49:55.80 not you know super well versed in like automchanics whatever and you're like hey man I've been
00:49:55.80 --> 00:50:00.36 looking to this I got a small issue with my car I got to know how to solve this issue where do you go
00:50:00.36 --> 00:50:06.52 for you know when there's manual or am I connected to whatever let's say if you need some answers
00:50:06.52 --> 00:50:12.52 you go to the manual you know that manual is for your car straight up you can go to the internet
00:50:12.52 --> 00:50:16.20 for sure but you go to the manual you're going to get the answer for your question however it's
00:50:16.20 --> 00:50:22.44 directed directly linked to your issue with your specificer this manual if you regard that as your
00:50:22.44 --> 00:50:31.56 manual for not necessarily your physical but but for how you are gonna be those answers are for you
00:50:32.28 --> 00:50:36.84 then oh yeah all day because you know it's easy to go on the internet
00:50:38.04 --> 00:50:43.16 the gram right I'm a following inspirational person you know and maybe that applies to me maybe it
00:50:43.16 --> 00:50:47.48 doesn't and then after a while it's all just sort of like yeah I heard that before cool saying
00:50:48.04 --> 00:50:51.72 let me go back to what I was doing kind of a thing and it sort of doesn't land anymore
00:50:51.72 --> 00:50:57.24 but if you regard again like this book for you like you need and you say you know just how you said
00:50:57.24 --> 00:51:01.64 it's like gonna go where you can just just pick it up and just read it you know for a minute or whatever
00:51:01.64 --> 00:51:07.80 that answer whatever you read that is for you it nit crazy though that like and that's what
00:51:07.80 --> 00:51:12.52 that's what all the reasons why I wanted to talk about this is because like that whole thing was
00:51:12.52 --> 00:51:18.28 Seth like I needed my own book I needed to go to the owner's manual yeah I needed that my
00:51:18.28 --> 00:51:25.96 so I wrote these words I contemplated them I lived through them I garnered the experience and then at
00:51:25.96 --> 00:51:34.12 the moment in time I actually needed to go to this manual and say what am I supposed to do right now
00:51:35.32 --> 00:51:40.36 yeah exactly right and that there's all kinds of you know I mean that's an extreme example
00:51:41.16 --> 00:51:47.80 but you know even as I read like the binary code thing it's like yes oh yeah how easy is it to just
00:51:47.80 --> 00:51:53.96 go and add other way over there that's kind of going to a horrible you know lame week place filled
00:51:53.96 --> 00:52:00.28 with gray excuses and justifications if you're gonna justify yourself yeah gray all day you know
00:52:00.28 --> 00:52:05.72 not black going anyway so that's that's what that's what the that's what the thoughts and there's
00:52:05.72 --> 00:52:10.60 a bunch of these more and this the the the new field manual that's the difference is I added a
00:52:10.60 --> 00:52:15.64 but a bunch more of into this thought section about mind control about weakness and about the
00:52:15.64 --> 00:52:20.60 destroyer mode and about the application of discipline about the fear of failure and about what to
00:52:20.60 --> 00:52:25.000 do and you're not feeling it and what what to do and you get overwhelmed and how to detach and
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.76 how to handle the feet and just all these things that we need help with that I need help with that
00:52:30.76 --> 00:52:37.72 we as human beings need help with a bunch of stuff in there that you can pick up and that will
00:52:37.72 --> 00:52:45.56 keep you on the path but as we know thoughts only go so far right we have to take action which is the
00:52:45.56 --> 00:52:51.64 next section of the book it is called actions and and the first little section in actions is physical
00:52:51.64 --> 00:52:59.000 training subtitle getting after it yes there physical training back to the book there are all
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.56 kinds of benefits from physical training you will be healthier this is a fact by working out
00:53:03.56 --> 00:53:08.76 you will increase your endorphins testosterone go form on cardiac value insulin sensitivity
00:53:08.76 --> 00:53:14.12 and natural killer cells those changes will help prevent or treat the following health issues
00:53:14.12 --> 00:53:19.000 high blood pressure obesity heart disease type 2 diabetes in Somia and depression boom
00:53:21.24 --> 00:53:29.48 still not convinced working out will make you smarter yes smarter it improves blood flow to the
00:53:29.48 --> 00:53:36.76 brain it boosts growth hormones that promote growth of new nerve cells it improves synaptic
00:53:36.76 --> 00:53:43.88 plasticity the ability for neurons to send and receive messages it releases brain chemicals
00:53:43.88 --> 00:53:51.40 that help cognition like dopamine glutamate nor an effort and serotonin it also boosts the
00:53:51.40 --> 00:53:57.64 production of brain derived neurotropic factor approaching that helps with mental processes
00:53:57.64 --> 00:54:05.96 but don't just take my word for it go do get some exercise done and pay attention to your mental
00:54:05.96 --> 00:54:14.12 state you will feel more aware sharper and smarter this is real there you go this is like oh
00:54:14.12 --> 00:54:18.52 why do you want to physically why do you want to work out it actually makes you smarter look it
00:54:18.52 --> 00:54:24.12 makes you stronger it makes you more healthy but it made I might my my my daughter all this daughter
00:54:24.12 --> 00:54:31.08 was taking a what a final exam to a final week all day she's all stressed out you know
00:54:31.88 --> 00:54:37.72 because she likes to get whatever high grades and stuff yeah that whole thing yeah and uh she was
00:54:37.72 --> 00:54:42.92 like told I go you need to go and and it just so happened when I see this out when it was reviewing
00:54:42.92 --> 00:54:47.88 for this book but I was reviewing like you know I did a bunch of research and read a bunch of stuff
00:54:47.88 --> 00:54:53.64 because look I know I feel I know I feel smarter and better when I work out but when I was writing
00:54:53.64 --> 00:54:59.88 this book I said okay what is that you know so I started asking I talked to Peter or Tier 2
00:54:59.88 --> 00:55:04.36 to go I was like hey what what is up with us and these are the kind of things these big words
00:55:04.36 --> 00:55:10.92 these big medical words that I put in there right so I told my daughter said go for like at least
00:55:10.92 --> 00:55:19.32 a 20 minute workout before this examination and she did so that's what you need that's why we're
00:55:19.32 --> 00:55:24.36 working out that's why we're working out it's so obvious that it's so good for you and even from
00:55:24.36 --> 00:55:30.92 the earliest of podcast echo trials you made this statement exercise is like the thing that you can
00:55:30.92 --> 00:55:36.52 do in your life that will positively impact the most other things in your life which is a bold statement
00:55:36.52 --> 00:55:44.36 and a true statement in my humble opinion stress the good and the bad this is this is an area
00:55:44.36 --> 00:55:50.92 where I talk about stress and look in order to improve we need stress we need to push the body
00:55:50.92 --> 00:55:56.36 and the mind in order to get better one of our main physical reactions to stress is to release
00:55:56.36 --> 00:56:02.12 the hormone cortisol into the body it has a multitude of effects including making glucose available
00:56:02.12 --> 00:56:07.80 and so I go into this what it does what stress does to you and and it's positive because it
00:56:07.80 --> 00:56:15.40 generates energy it focuses energy it focuses you on immediate threats it prepares you for immediate
00:56:15.40 --> 00:56:23.08 threats so that stuff is all good it allows you to do better in the world but you can also go
00:56:23.08 --> 00:56:27.64 overboard with it stress can be bad so I go through that too much stress and the cortisol is
00:56:27.64 --> 00:56:34.52 released too often it it it's like a car running in the red so I go into that whole thing so what we
00:56:34.52 --> 00:56:40.04 have to do is you have to stress the body and the mind in order to improve but obviously
00:56:40.04 --> 00:56:47.48 you can't overstress it so I talk through that whole thing and here's something I was like
00:56:47.48 --> 00:56:54.68 you know I'll cover this on the podcast and this section is called sleep this is for the haters
00:56:55.24 --> 00:57:01.88 can I use that word and not be a 15 year old girl oh yeah sure the haters so
00:57:01.88 --> 00:57:11.40 so obviously you know I get up early every day and get stuff done oh man you took you back down
00:57:11.40 --> 00:57:18.76 the other day what up oh yeah I chose traveling so good point so the other day I was traveling
00:57:18.76 --> 00:57:28.20 my flight was delayed or whatever and I didn't get back into SD until midnight got home at
00:57:28.20 --> 00:57:36.52 1230 and I had spent a couple days on East Coast time so I wasn't even really like I do always
00:57:36.52 --> 00:57:42.44 entire so I probably fell asleep at like a 130 my alarm went off at 430 and I was like I
00:57:42.44 --> 00:57:48.92 didn't play this see what this feels like at 430 that 430 I wasn't yeah so I went back to sleep
00:57:49.80 --> 00:57:54.20 why because sleep is good for you and if you don't have enough sleep you don't
00:57:54.20 --> 00:58:00.28 you don't perform well you don't think well now listen here's the thing people go crazy with this
00:58:00.28 --> 00:58:06.84 right and people you should read this you should like they say if you have less than 8 hours of
00:58:06.84 --> 00:58:15.32 sleep you're like being a drunk yeah that is just factually untrue right I'm telling you I
00:58:15.32 --> 00:58:21.96 have like you've been to the muster right at some of the early musters where life and I are on stage
00:58:21.96 --> 00:58:25.96 we're answering questions we're interacting with people we're roleplaying we're going through dynamics and
00:58:25.96 --> 00:58:34.52 areas we're we're performing cognitive cognitive tasks for 8 and a half straight 8 and a half
00:58:34.52 --> 00:58:40.44 9 10 hours straight we had one hour of sleep not kidding this some of those musters the new
00:58:40.44 --> 00:58:48.52 York muster I think we had like one hour of sleep so if we had if if before the muster I had done
00:58:48.52 --> 00:58:55.32 16 shots of yager muster the muster would have been a lot different now some people
00:58:55.32 --> 00:59:03.000 might have liked it those people wanted their money back so look sleep so so this is people think
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.04 I don't like sleep or I don't support sleep or I think you know you and it's not true and I was
00:59:08.04 --> 00:59:13.48 saying when people you think you're you're you're giving people advice that's unhealthy here's the
00:59:13.48 --> 00:59:20.76 actual advice that I give people from the book sleep is an necessity humans need sleep failure to get
00:59:20.76 --> 00:59:26.84 enough sleep has serious side effects lack of sleep can cause negative hormonal changes interfere with
00:59:26.84 --> 00:59:34.36 them metabolizing glucose of glucose increase blood pressure and suppress the immune system less sleep
00:59:34.36 --> 00:59:40.60 also means less human growth hormone in your body which means less muscle mass and weaker bones
00:59:40.60 --> 00:59:45.08 mentally the brain is impacted as the ability to pay attention and concentrate begins to diminish
00:59:45.08 --> 00:59:51.40 and problem solving and basic reasoning becomes less acute furthermore over an extended period there are
00:59:51.40 --> 00:59:58.20 psychological effects like paranoia and even hallucinations so that's me talking about sleep you need
00:59:58.20 --> 01:00:08.44 to sleep I'm not anti-sleep is there a thing called a fast sleeper yes we'll get there we'll get there so
01:00:08.44 --> 01:00:14.76 so check this out but how much sleep is enough different people need different amounts of sleep new
01:00:14.76 --> 01:00:21.48 borns can sleep up to 17 hours a day toddlers can sleep 12 hours a day as people grow older
01:00:21.48 --> 01:00:27.08 less sleep is required teens generally need 8 to 10 hours and by the time people are full of
01:00:27.08 --> 01:00:33.40 adults 8 hours becomes the standard even though the actual number is between 7 and 9 hours depending
01:00:33.40 --> 01:00:37.80 on the individual some people genetically need even less sleep than that but those people are rare
01:00:38.44 --> 01:00:43.96 I'm one of those people and this isn't I don't have the proof well here's my proof
01:00:45.80 --> 01:00:51.64 I guess I'm proof my oldest daughter is like me like last night she was studying she's
01:00:51.64 --> 01:00:57.32 went to bed at midnight I woke up at 4th of the she's up and then she took an exam cognitive not
01:00:57.32 --> 01:01:03.24 impaired right she's gonna get an A you know what I'm saying so but but my second daughter
01:01:04.76 --> 01:01:09.32 the girl likes to sleep like she'll get out of bed when you go drag her out of bed right like she likes to sleep
01:01:09.96 --> 01:01:15.72 my son kind of it kind of normal I would say my wife she digs that sleep
01:01:15.72 --> 01:01:21.16 mm so some of my kids get some of it my youngest daughter she's sort of a little bit I would
01:01:21.16 --> 01:01:27.72 see that's sleep too but but so there's so so I think there is some sort of genetic thing
01:01:31.64 --> 01:01:39.24 here's a but it's it's people also will look you that it's so rare there's no chance you
01:01:39.24 --> 01:01:45.88 have it okay cool I'm gonna I can really tell you people like people say sleep more I'm not
01:01:46.68 --> 01:01:51.32 trying to sleep less I'm more than happy to sleep you know but it just doesn't happen
01:01:53.88 --> 01:01:58.20 so going on here but it isn't only genetics you can also sleep less and fall sleep faster
01:01:58.20 --> 01:02:03.80 if you are in good physical condition eating clean and have a clear mind for me the better condition
01:02:03.80 --> 01:02:08.84 I'm in and the cleaner I eat the more quickly I will fall asleep and the less sleep I need do you
01:02:08.84 --> 01:02:16.12 notice this do you notice that you need to less sleep when you're fasting I don't notice but
01:02:16.12 --> 01:02:21.40 I'm not paying attention okay I like going I when I'm fasting I feel like I'm on fire
01:02:22.28 --> 01:02:29.48 yeah and I I just did a fast I just did a 48 hour and I feel I felt like later again like I was
01:02:29.48 --> 01:02:37.08 waking up earlier than I normally wake up so while I do have short sleep genetics on my side
01:02:37.08 --> 01:02:42.68 equally important is that I stay healthy and eat clean what about when you eat junk how don't you
01:02:42.68 --> 01:02:48.04 need to sleep more yeah but actually you know what it's really inconsistent when you junk or
01:02:48.04 --> 01:02:57.40 sorry when I eat junk it's sometimes all sleep less but be wanting to sleep more but you know
01:02:57.40 --> 01:03:02.28 the kind like you're tired and you feel sleepy but you can't like go to sleep you know it's like that
01:03:02.28 --> 01:03:08.28 there's a lot of that go in the worst I think you feel like you wish you would sleep more but you can
01:03:08.28 --> 01:03:13.32 you kind of can't just get up yeah exactly and feel like crap or whatever and sort of you know
01:03:13.32 --> 01:03:19.48 maybe catch the next wave of sleepiness I guess the and on the inverse when you're talking
01:03:19.48 --> 01:03:24.68 about like when you exercise consistent you eat clean or whatever and it's really different
01:03:24.68 --> 01:03:30.68 where and it's really real clear where you feel freaking solid during the day and then once that
01:03:30.68 --> 01:03:35.56 bedtime ish kind of rolls around you just feel the wave just crash and you're like oh it's bit
01:03:35.56 --> 01:03:41.72 sleep time so good yeah it's really good when you worked out hard you had a good day you ate clean
01:03:42.28 --> 01:03:46.76 you get to the end of that you're like boom you're out right that's how it was yesterday and like
01:03:46.76 --> 01:03:52.52 and I got like an hour less sleep than I normally did the day before so but I got up solid boom
01:03:52.52 --> 01:03:58.60 feeling good now that we're thinking about this when I have like those weird roller coaster
01:03:58.60 --> 01:04:05.40 brain rides that's usually that's usually when I'm like something's messed up you know what weather
01:04:05.40 --> 01:04:14.92 I'm eating crap or or whatever yeah bro it was the kind of like I do quizzes in story time for
01:04:14.92 --> 01:04:19.72 what the kids before bed every night is like what eight or clock eight 30 bro it was the time
01:04:19.72 --> 01:04:27.88 like it's a kind in the middle of a question that I'm asking it's straight up that's a day right there
01:04:27.88 --> 01:04:32.68 yeah it's like okay it's about that yeah I I've had that world when my kids were a little
01:04:32.68 --> 01:04:38.52 and I was telling the durs you know you're just getting up at 430 you're doing whatever you're
01:04:38.52 --> 01:04:44.12 doing at water come home you know and you're just getting bed read that story next thing you know it's
01:04:44.12 --> 01:04:49.80 free a clock at the morning for clock the morning what just happened yeah my wife left me in there
01:04:49.80 --> 01:04:55.48 because she was running around with three kids at the time you know trying to get them all square
01:04:55.48 --> 01:05:00.12 to waste you like oh you got the kid school she probably went to a bar out on the what she
01:05:00.12 --> 01:05:04.84 did that she knows that girl went to sleep she used to fall asleep with someone kid almost every night
01:05:04.84 --> 01:05:13.96 it was crazy so going on here and finally I choose not to sleep in I don't give in
01:05:13.96 --> 01:05:19.64 to the pillow I don't give into the temptation of warm blankets or soft pillow I mobilize the
01:05:19.64 --> 01:05:24.76 will to get me out of bed and get into the game obviously I'm an advocate of waking up early
01:05:24.76 --> 01:05:32.44 but since sleep must be a priority to maintain health how can we get enough sleep and still wake up early
01:05:32.44 --> 01:05:42.12 the answer is simple go to bed earlier go to bed earlier now I'm gonna skip the little bit here
01:05:42.12 --> 01:05:45.96 go forward well this I talked about some of the benefits like what are the benefit why do I
01:05:45.96 --> 01:05:51.32 wake up early and I mean first there's some simple math but why do you wake up early the world is yours
01:05:51.96 --> 01:05:56.12 when you're up before the enemy there's no traffic the gym is empty there's no one distract you
01:05:56.12 --> 01:06:01.16 or call you or send you some stupid text about something you don't care about so there's like
01:06:01.16 --> 01:06:08.36 all these benefits to to being up early but then going back to the other point falling asleep how
01:06:08.36 --> 01:06:12.04 do you fall asleep so this is kind of what we're just talking about number one and there's a whole
01:06:12.04 --> 01:06:17.16 section I'm gonna read some highlights of it number one get tired yes get tired if you are not active
01:06:17.16 --> 01:06:23.56 throughout the day you won't be tired you know it's weird as a recording the podcast depending on the podcast
01:06:24.12 --> 01:06:31.48 I'm usually super wired when we get done recording and then I'm tired you know it's a mental
01:06:31.48 --> 01:06:39.24 mental work yeah fully on number two turn off the computer turn off the smartphone stop checking
01:06:39.24 --> 01:06:45.96 social media and stop watching one more YouTube video sure there's some science it says that the
01:06:45.96 --> 01:06:51.56 light from the computer and phone screen tricks your mind and thinking is daylight and time to get
01:06:51.56 --> 01:06:56.20 up but on top of that the internet is filled with professionals that create content with the
01:06:56.20 --> 01:07:01.24 sole purpose of getting you to click on it yes clickbait is real and just like the bait used
01:07:01.24 --> 01:07:07.56 in fishing it is a trick to get you hooked so don't don't click it you will get nothing positive at
01:07:07.56 --> 01:07:12.68 all number three read if your mind is still active when you reach your bedtime that's okay
01:07:12.68 --> 01:07:17.32 get into bed and get a book and start reading reading is relaxing it settles your mind and makes you
01:07:17.32 --> 01:07:26.04 smarter so do it dude reading will reading I think reading is a massive sleep aid yeah everyone's
01:07:26.04 --> 01:07:31.48 wanting to like you not everyone's well most of them actually in my experience because I wouldn't be
01:07:31.48 --> 01:07:38.68 reading a boring book that's his first specific purpose but usually they're interesting books so
01:07:38.68 --> 01:07:44.20 at first I might be like oh kind of excited but yeah man after it depends on the day or whatever
01:07:44.20 --> 01:07:49.24 but it can be like after like 10 minutes 15 minutes I you know the kind of books I read because I
01:07:49.24 --> 01:07:53.72 read them on the podcast all the time I'm talking about books about war combat in the most dynamic
01:07:53.72 --> 01:08:01.32 heroic situations like even those books if I'm reading I'll be like oh if it's nighttime and I'm
01:08:01.32 --> 01:08:05.96 reading I'll I'll get tired of falsely yeah I mean I won't I don't falsely while I'm reading I
01:08:05.96 --> 01:08:10.04 really do that but I'll be like okay I'm tired yeah I've missed out the book and go bad oh yeah
01:08:10.04 --> 01:08:15.08 then that's exactly what I'm saying or maybe at first if it's like super interesting or exciting
01:08:15.08 --> 01:08:20.60 whatever book you're like at first you're like oh man let's get some reading going you know about this
01:08:20.60 --> 01:08:25.56 whatever you're reading about and then yeah after like I said it depends on how your state of mine is
01:08:25.56 --> 01:08:30.60 but as far as time goes but yeah after a little while you're ready you're ready to go sleep
01:08:30.60 --> 01:08:35.64 I just got done reading a book for the podcast that it was it was it was a book that I like
01:08:36.28 --> 01:08:39.88 was actively couldn't sleep because I just was like I'm gonna read this more of this because I
01:08:39.88 --> 01:08:46.52 want to know what's about the happen that's pretty crazy. Number four most important the key to
01:08:46.52 --> 01:08:52.92 getting to sleep early is getting up early. No it might not help you tonight but tomorrow night it
01:08:52.92 --> 01:08:57.80 will. If you need seven full hours of sleep and you want to get up at 430 a.m. that means you need to
01:08:57.80 --> 01:09:05.64 go to bed at 930 p.m. but it is hard to force yourself to sleep at 930 so you stay up until 1130
01:09:06.60 --> 01:09:11.16 you should still get up at 430 yes that will only be five hours of sleep and yes you will
01:09:11.16 --> 01:09:15.16 likely feel tired throughout the day which is actually good because at the end of the day you'll
01:09:15.16 --> 01:09:21.24 want to be tired now you can go to bed at 930 and get yourself back on track that's that's the
01:09:21.24 --> 01:09:26.60 part that people if you want to be tired at night at 930 you need to get up early you can't you can't
01:09:26.60 --> 01:09:35.08 get up at 9 in the morning and expect to be tired at 9 at night it won't happen and the last thing
01:09:35.08 --> 01:09:40.36 is do it every day right and this is like you know weekend this way it's just whatever to do the same
01:09:40.36 --> 01:09:43.72 time look if you want to give yourself an extra half an hour I don't even recommend that I recommend
01:09:43.72 --> 01:09:52.12 you get up at the same time every day yeah that um here's a mistake I think that well
01:09:52.12 --> 01:09:57.40 when I say some people me I make this mistake or I have made this mistake straight up where
01:09:57.40 --> 01:10:02.04 I'll be like okay yeah I'm gonna do that I want to get up early you know and earlier whatever so I'll
01:10:02.04 --> 01:10:07.80 just wake up earlier and be tired throughout the day but what I did is I didn't look at the big
01:10:07.80 --> 01:10:13.48 picture I was like all just automatically be tired at night you know but what I did was I would
01:10:13.48 --> 01:10:19.80 lays through the desk it worked out a lot of laying down on the couch you know a lot more than normal
01:10:19.80 --> 01:10:26.44 and then you know you know you basically sense your tired you kind of adjust your activity accordingly
01:10:26.44 --> 01:10:31.72 you know in a bad way so you do just way less and then nighttime comes you're not as tired as as
01:10:31.72 --> 01:10:35.56 you could have been if you just went about your normal routine sure you got power through it
01:10:35.56 --> 01:10:39.88 little bit harder for sure if you're on less sleep or whatever but at the end when it comes
01:10:39.88 --> 01:10:46.28 time to sleep which was your goal it's gonna be way more like it's gonna happen easy you know
01:10:46.28 --> 01:10:51.24 or it's gonna happen in my case they just straight up doesn't happen I'm freaking up late again
01:10:51.24 --> 01:10:56.36 can't go sleep with him yeah gotta be careful so yeah do the normal routine don't be slacking
01:10:57.56 --> 01:11:01.40 I got a little section on here on power and apps people like do you take an app yes I do
01:11:01.40 --> 01:11:06.12 if I'm super tired but I then I explain the whole thing in here elevate your feet above your heart
01:11:06.12 --> 01:11:10.76 which I learned from one of my high school teachers and then I only sleep for like eight minutes
01:11:11.56 --> 01:11:15.000 and if you really tired eight minutes seems like you just got a full on
01:11:15.88 --> 01:11:21.000 massive amount of sleep yeah remember we were talking about the two types of tired
01:11:22.28 --> 01:11:27.80 yeah yeah this sleepy tired and then there's like physical fatigue yeah kind of and then you know
01:11:27.80 --> 01:11:33.48 what kind of in the total eight minute nap thing sometimes six minutes it's almost like in this
01:11:33.48 --> 01:11:41.000 is all what do you call hypothesis and what will say that where if like if you could just go
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.40 like if you just did like a marathon freaking podcasters or you know after you do a podcast you
01:11:47.40 --> 01:11:53.24 mentioned where you're kind of tired you know something that that that required like cognitive
01:11:53.24 --> 01:12:01.80 effort for a somewhat sustained amount of time you you're not exhausted physically but mentally
01:12:01.80 --> 01:12:07.72 you might have like this sharpness they usually have this just dull because like your your foot like
01:12:07.72 --> 01:12:13.72 it's almost like a superficial conscious like cognitive like a bit almost that's what it almost seems
01:12:13.72 --> 01:12:21.08 like so if I'm working on something on the computer like admin numbers or freaking stuff
01:12:21.08 --> 01:12:28.36 not editing stuff like you know work for like three hours and then it's work out time
01:12:28.36 --> 01:12:33.64 I'm gonna take one of those six minute eight minute in a couple so much yeah for sure
01:12:33.64 --> 01:12:38.68 but the thing is like six minute eight minutes what can what can possibly recover in that I don't
01:12:38.68 --> 01:12:44.92 know it's real oh yeah it's real and it's like you've ever had a dream in eight minutes oh yeah
01:12:44.92 --> 01:12:50.28 I have four on dreams and you ever have those little half dreams like okay so usually it happens it
01:12:50.28 --> 01:12:55.72 is your body moved yes but it's something very specific though where sometimes you just like
01:12:55.72 --> 01:12:59.40 feel like oh you just jump run almost like oh no for me it's because someone's talking about
01:12:59.40 --> 01:13:06.52 the lack of my head and my dreams so yeah that makes sense but yes it's that it's that though
01:13:06.52 --> 01:13:11.80 it's something specific where like like the other days I was I was getting one in and
01:13:11.80 --> 01:13:17.80 my son in my little dream it lasted literally like two seconds like a two second dream almost
01:13:18.44 --> 01:13:23.80 and my son like ran under my legs and I like I did jump over him oh my dream yeah so I
01:13:23.80 --> 01:13:27.96 jumped and I'm like that's what caused me to jump but it was I remember it was my son ran
01:13:27.96 --> 01:13:32.60 under my legs that sounds a lot more pleasant than a battle axe yeah but I'm very into the battle
01:13:32.60 --> 01:13:35.64 axe yeah my hair kill you probably a lot different than yours for sure
01:13:35.64 --> 01:13:46.84 uh next section the workouts everyone wants to know what should a workout actually consist of
01:13:46.84 --> 01:13:52.92 and first of all let me say this the most important thing is to do something anything walk
01:13:52.92 --> 01:13:57.80 jog calcenex swim lift some way to hike stretch do burpees play a game of basketball or go
01:13:57.80 --> 01:14:04.04 get on the gizzi to map some people aren't sure what to do for a workout but that is often just an excuse
01:14:04.04 --> 01:14:09.32 exercise doesn't need to be some complex multi-level multi-dimensional, multi-dimensional
01:14:09.32 --> 01:14:16.44 scientifically proven methodology but it does need to be something so go through a whole section about
01:14:16.44 --> 01:14:26.28 the workouts and then I actually put workouts in the book to see the actual workouts go to appendix
01:14:26.28 --> 01:14:32.04 the workouts again use the workouts as a guide learn about your own body push yourself most important
01:14:32.04 --> 01:14:38.60 be consistent and consistency starts with getting in the gym if you are tired or sore or
01:14:38.60 --> 01:14:43.88 burned out don't just give up completely go to the gym and stretch move do some light exercises
01:14:43.88 --> 01:14:49.48 but keep the routine in place too often people take the day off and that turns into two
01:14:50.04 --> 01:14:54.04 and two into three and then they've gone a week without getting in a good workout so
01:14:54.04 --> 01:15:00.84 maintain the routine maintain the discipline I didn't cover this section but that's I've had a lot of
01:15:00.84 --> 01:15:07.96 people like this attitude you're tired your sore you feel like you need a day off cool do it tomorrow
01:15:09.08 --> 01:15:13.16 still do the workout today do tomorrow because it's it's a way tomorrow I was in take the day off tomorrow
01:15:13.16 --> 01:15:19.24 take the day off tomorrow so you know you go to that spot you're like you know what I could
01:15:19.24 --> 01:15:24.12 probably just type you know I worked out really hard it's been it's been six days it's been three days
01:15:24.12 --> 01:15:30.76 straight I'm kind of tired I do have this you know project do I actually really
01:15:30.76 --> 01:15:35.64 take the day off today okay cool you can take the day off tomorrow still have to do it today
01:15:35.64 --> 01:15:39.80 I guess what you wake up tomorrow you don't need to take a day off it was all just negotiate
01:15:39.80 --> 01:15:43.56 yeah look but the cool thing is you maybe you do need to day off cool you wake up the next day
01:15:43.56 --> 01:15:48.28 you're like god I am so cool take the day off yeah yeah and that's the pre and I've done that before
01:15:48.28 --> 01:15:54.04 where I'm beyond I'm not that good at doing that yet but I've done that before world be like
01:15:54.04 --> 01:15:57.08 no I'm going to power through in fact I'm going to go as hard as I freaking can I'm going to go
01:15:57.08 --> 01:16:02.44 extra hard and then I'll take it tomorrow and then on times where I really did need the day off
01:16:02.44 --> 01:16:10.12 the next day I feel even worse like oh yeah yeah but other times it's most of the time
01:16:10.12 --> 01:16:15.72 most of the day it's just the day you don't feel like it you freaking whatever you did last night
01:16:15.72 --> 01:16:19.24 or whatever it's some some other factor that has to do with just the day you know you're
01:16:19.24 --> 01:16:24.20 some stances you don't so just like have some minimum work out that you must do
01:16:24.20 --> 01:16:30.36 yeah yeah yeah like oh you know what oh you're gonna be a you're you're you're you're
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.96 a millimeter from not doing anything okay I'm gonna go do the minimum work out I'm gonna
01:16:35.96 --> 01:16:42.20 do this just this stuff get it done and then if I still feel like crap tomorrow I'll take a legit
01:16:42.20 --> 01:16:48.28 day off yeah and another thing that that is almost like a thing that gets revealed is that
01:16:48.28 --> 01:16:53.96 minimum workout thing has obviously a bunch of benefits but usually you know how like and again
01:16:53.96 --> 01:16:58.36 depends on what you were doing before the workout maybe what you're doing last at whatever but a
01:16:58.36 --> 01:17:03.24 lot of times once you just get the blood flowing right or once you're yeah yeah and this is the
01:17:03.24 --> 01:17:07.72 thing I don't know that the full ins and outs of it get asked of actual fitness person but like it's
01:17:07.72 --> 01:17:12.76 it's called priming priming your body and mind whatever for work out so a lot of times you're just
01:17:12.76 --> 01:17:18.36 deprimed I made that word up deep primed but you understand what I'm saying right it's the opposite
01:17:18.36 --> 01:17:25.000 of pulling priming sometimes you're just more deprimed than you normally are you know and you're
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.80 just really not into it for other reasons you know so sometimes that minimum workout you're like
01:17:29.80 --> 01:17:36.68 all right and you sort it inadvertently primed your whole deal yeah I'm not so retired and over
01:17:36.68 --> 01:17:43.16 change but I noticed that a lot with with anybody part but like your legs for sure if you know when
01:17:43.16 --> 01:17:49.56 it's squat day yeah now we don't know what what unseen mechanisms are at work in your brain
01:17:49.56 --> 01:17:54.68 that are telling you that you're like more sore but a lot of times you're rolling into squat
01:17:54.68 --> 01:18:00.84 day and you're feeling in your mind you're thinking on pretty sore you're really negotiating
01:18:00.84 --> 01:18:06.60 hard for that day off and you really notice after you and even your first couple sets you know you're
01:18:06.60 --> 01:18:11.000 just do you just do some some body weight squats just to warm up and you're like oh I'm definitely
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.16 sore then you do the 45 pound bar just you're just getting warmed up yeah you take the PVC pipe you
01:18:17.16 --> 01:18:22.92 do some overhead squats you're like wow I'm definitely sore and then when you start putting some
01:18:22.92 --> 01:18:27.32 some weight on you start realizing I'm actually not sore I just start feeling good and you're
01:18:27.32 --> 01:18:34.52 good to go yeah you were good to go that's what that's that happens a lot that happens a lot
01:18:34.52 --> 01:18:39.32 this seems to happen a lot on on the on the good old squat day too so when you say and this is
01:18:39.32 --> 01:18:45.80 more your personal thing like your squat day or whatever well you do just squats or legs or whatever
01:18:45.80 --> 01:18:50.68 or is it like a you know I mean I do some other stuff but yes I will be other body parts
01:18:50.68 --> 01:18:55.32 or other exercises for later no really it's just about just just squat day yeah squat day which
01:18:55.32 --> 01:19:01.32 encompasses all kinds of different leg work we'll say yeah I've done I've always done multiple
01:19:01.32 --> 01:19:09.32 body parts but usually squat day would would be just part of just a multiple body part day but
01:19:09.32 --> 01:19:14.36 when I sweat it was a hack kind of out of laziness in a way where I'd be like you know what I'm just
01:19:14.36 --> 01:19:19.48 gonna designate one day for just squats and then I started incorporating just a small muscle group
01:19:19.48 --> 01:19:26.76 like a girl's situation maybe some triceps then do the squats so if if I do like shoulders for
01:19:26.76 --> 01:19:32.12 example depends on the workout obviously but if I'm going like hardcore shoulder press then freaking
01:19:32.12 --> 01:19:37.88 super set of this and that you know a whole shoulder workout and you want me to go do squats now
01:19:39.16 --> 01:19:46.28 after the age of about 30 that started to be less and less of a sustainable thing mentally in my
01:19:46.28 --> 01:19:51.000 mind okay that's interesting so you've gotten mentally weaker if you've got as you've gotten older
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.20 yes there I have apparently that's strange but you sure you just didn't get it smarter where you
01:19:56.20 --> 01:20:01.000 realized if you really wanted to push you needed to focus you needed to prioritize next cube I would
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.24 say that that's a good way of putting it making it sound better or rationalizing right and maybe
01:20:05.24 --> 01:20:10.68 rationalize it or maybe that was the case the whole time you know where I could be benefiting way more
01:20:10.68 --> 01:20:19.24 from this this this leg workout if I just soloed it one day rather than doing a big other body part
01:20:19.24 --> 01:20:23.88 workout then than the legs and vice versa too because sometimes I would do the squats first
01:20:23.88 --> 01:20:28.68 and then suffer through a shoulder workout or something like this yeah but now anyway let's
01:20:28.68 --> 01:20:36.36 do like I always I always if possible lift before due to yeah right that's do you do that yeah
01:20:36.36 --> 01:20:45.96 100% and I'll tell you it's it's not because it's not it's it's it's because
01:20:46.92 --> 01:20:53.72 Gigi to I don't want to go and work out I would rather go to Gigi to with some muscle fatigue
01:20:53.72 --> 01:21:00.20 than go to workout with muscle fatigue yeah even though isn't that that seems backwards that
01:21:00.20 --> 01:21:04.36 seemed counterintuitive I know because you think I'm going to compete against echoes or I want to be
01:21:04.36 --> 01:21:11.48 ready to go yeah it seems like the intuitive thing but I would much rather just be a little bit
01:21:11.48 --> 01:21:18.68 tired when I'm rolling with whoever then to be all then to be tired when I roll into the gym yeah well
01:21:18.68 --> 01:21:24.20 and now I think if you know the dynamics of both types of workouts I think it's obvious that you
01:21:24.20 --> 01:21:31.64 do want to lift do a lifting before Gigi to because Gigi to has quick diminishing returns with strength
01:21:31.64 --> 01:21:40.20 that's very quick yeah endurance not so much but muscle like strength or whatever it's quick but
01:21:40.20 --> 01:21:45.64 it's the opposite for lifting weights so you need your strength you don't necessarily need that
01:21:45.64 --> 01:21:49.40 much endurance depending on the workout obviously but as far as lifting weights goes you don't need
01:21:49.40 --> 01:21:55.08 that much endurance but when you go to Gigi to if you don't have that much strength but as long
01:21:55.08 --> 01:21:59.32 as you can kind of sustain and you know do this thing I mean you're not going to run like a whole
01:21:59.32 --> 01:22:04.04 crossfit games routine and then go to Gigi to and think you're going to feel good I mean it's
01:22:04.04 --> 01:22:09.40 a bit different you know but that's true although I'll tell you like I'll do some crazy workouts
01:22:09.40 --> 01:22:15.64 and so go to Gigi to barely remember that I mean and I'm not talking I go like walk from one to the
01:22:15.64 --> 01:22:20.44 other you know I work out the morning really hard and then in the afternoon I'm going to Gigi
01:22:20.44 --> 01:22:24.52 yeah but that time you go what 80-90% of your strength actually it's not that big of a deal yeah and
01:22:24.52 --> 01:22:28.92 Gigi to different like that because the your energy output in Gigi to is very variable very
01:22:28.92 --> 01:22:33.24 much so and you can modulate fully like and you know it's going to obviously depend on who you're
01:22:33.24 --> 01:22:37.80 rolling with as well you go with a tornado dude who's good it's like you're going to feel that
01:22:37.80 --> 01:22:42.28 workout in the morning if you have that kind of day but if a normal day of Gigi to where some
01:22:42.28 --> 01:22:46.36 guys you go hard sometimes you go medium sometimes you don't have to go as hard as far as that goes
01:22:46.36 --> 01:22:52.76 you can modulate and yeah navigate through the energy output easy but as far as like the type of
01:22:52.76 --> 01:22:57.80 exercise versus the other type of exercise lifting whatever if you switch them around you do
01:22:57.80 --> 01:23:02.04 Gigi to first and all that sort of sustained output and you thinking and going to go into a
01:23:02.04 --> 01:23:09.16 lifting and freaking push hard negative yeah that's a weird thing man to weird thing but that's it
01:23:09.16 --> 01:23:14.68 seems to be you know you're an agreement on that got a section in here on building a home gym
01:23:15.40 --> 01:23:20.60 and this is obviously with the world that we're in right now with COVID this is a very
01:23:21.64 --> 01:23:26.60 good thing to have a home gym and you can I go through all the all the kinds of different things
01:23:26.60 --> 01:23:32.20 that you should get first and the considerations you know get in pull up bar and and then
01:23:32.20 --> 01:23:37.08 things like you know you I don't have enough money you can get a pull up bar for $9 at home
01:23:37.08 --> 01:23:42.20 people I'm not even talking about you know you go and whatever you can get a piece of pipe you
01:23:42.20 --> 01:23:46.04 you have a pull up bar you can get a set of rings for pretty cheap like there's a there's ways that
01:23:46.04 --> 01:23:51.32 you can make it happen so I got a little section in there and building a home gym yeah the home
01:23:51.32 --> 01:23:56.20 gym thing that the I think the primary factor that you really have to kind of consider and
01:23:56.20 --> 01:24:00.84 navigate is the space yeah more so than the money because money is like for the most part
01:24:01.56 --> 01:24:08.60 you can like spend way less or just you know make payments or whatever even the space though
01:24:08.60 --> 01:24:13.56 you can see people that do really cool creative things to get good work out in a small space
01:24:13.56 --> 01:24:21.08 yeah you do and you really need very minimal equipment to be in awesome shape really the only
01:24:21.08 --> 01:24:25.80 piece of equipment that I think you actually need is a pull up bar because if you have a pull up bar
01:24:25.80 --> 01:24:33.08 you can do pull ups but you can autumn you can already do push ups did not dips but push ups
01:24:33.08 --> 01:24:37.80 you can do all kinds of chest variation push up very like you can get crazy with push ups
01:24:37.80 --> 01:24:42.12 movers millions of different varieties of push ups you can do you can do squats you can do lunches
01:24:42.12 --> 01:24:46.68 you can do you can do basically your whole body can do handstand push ups for your shoulders like
01:24:46.68 --> 01:24:51.80 there's so many things that you can do if you just have a pull up bar if you don't have a pull up
01:24:51.80 --> 01:24:56.68 bar you're kind of yeah that's true yeah like you can't just like because all those things that
01:24:56.68 --> 01:25:02.28 you said aside from the the anything pulling or whatever you you don't need anything you just
01:25:02.28 --> 01:25:07.64 get the ground you just need the ground yeah man maybe a wall or a tree or whatever almost
01:25:07.64 --> 01:25:13.000 every building has a wall yes and every yeah or a tree there's some thing outside of whatever you
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.60 know but yeah the pulling thing it's hard to our to access if you don't have like a pull up bar
01:25:18.60 --> 01:25:24.76 rings are really good because then you can not only do pull ups you can also do dips and then there's
01:25:24.76 --> 01:25:29.72 all kinds of other crazy things that you can do with rings so rings are also awesome the next
01:25:29.72 --> 01:25:35.000 section is called martial arts again this is an operating this is my operating system and part of my
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.12 operating system as you've just heard a time out is martial arts and I say everyone should train in
01:25:40.12 --> 01:25:46.92 martial arts just as everyone should eat but just as food is different and varies greatly in how
01:25:46.92 --> 01:25:52.60 an affects your body not all martial arts are created equal there are three broad forms of martial arts
01:25:52.60 --> 01:25:59.88 grappling striking and weapons grappling uses leverage and hold to control or submit your opponent
01:25:59.88 --> 01:26:05.24 striking you striking uses punches kicks knees elbows head butts or any other body part to hit the
01:26:05.24 --> 01:26:11.16 opponent martial arts with weapons obviously use utilize a variety of weapons including sticks knives
01:26:11.16 --> 01:26:18.44 and in the modern world firearms perhaps the most critical form of self defense is the mind
01:26:19.48 --> 01:26:25.56 by being smart and aware you can avoid situations that are likely to expose you to danger that
01:26:25.56 --> 01:26:30.68 being said there are times when you're mind and your intelligence can no longer help you
01:26:32.04 --> 01:26:37.72 that is the reality so that's why we train right because there's as much as someone says
01:26:37.72 --> 01:26:42.20 you know I I'm able to avoid to look there's gonna be situations that you can end up in even if you're
01:26:42.20 --> 01:26:46.84 completely situational aware and you're looking to avoid situations they can still happen that's
01:26:46.84 --> 01:26:54.68 why you have to train I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit here because I talk about firearms
01:26:56.92 --> 01:27:04.20 and the necessity of firearms in certain situations and I say that's most important without proper
01:27:04.20 --> 01:27:09.40 training possessing a firearm as useless or even more dangerous to its owner than not having one learning
01:27:09.40 --> 01:27:14.28 how to shoot quickly and accurately while under stress is absolutely mandatory if one is going to
01:27:14.28 --> 01:27:18.92 own a firearm this means finding a good instructor at a quality range to participate in firearms training
01:27:20.04 --> 01:27:24.44 right so you you gotta have a firearm and and I'm gonna go back and read a section that I wasn't
01:27:24.44 --> 01:27:35.56 planning to read but I'm gonna read it anyways it is an eat the firearm the ultimate form of self
01:27:35.56 --> 01:27:41.64 defense is the firearm it is an equalizer without parallel and it's simply unmashing its ability
01:27:41.64 --> 01:27:46.52 to eliminate an attacker regardless of size and strength if a person truly needs self protection
01:27:46.52 --> 01:27:52.04 in a high threat area there is no substitute for the firearm even in an area that might be considered
01:27:52.04 --> 01:27:57.96 low threat there are no guarantees there have been horrific home invasions car jackings kidnappings
01:27:57.96 --> 01:28:02.76 and other vicious and violent attacks and some of the most prestigious neighborhoods in the world
01:28:02.76 --> 01:28:06.76 that were also considered to be the safest there is no choice but to be prepared
01:28:08.52 --> 01:28:15.40 so firearms talk about some of the training and what you do and you know some of the
01:28:15.40 --> 01:28:19.16 some of the benefits of it firearms training build to hand eye coordination speed, concentration and
01:28:19.16 --> 01:28:23.72 instincts it demands repetitive movement develop muscle memory so there's there's other benefits
01:28:23.72 --> 01:28:30.84 to to utilizing firearms than just self protection training competitive flee for speed and accuracy
01:28:30.84 --> 01:28:35.000 conditions you for high pressure situations by teaching the need to relax to attach and get
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.44 control your breathing and focus on the immediate task and like you can apply that to anything
01:28:38.44 --> 01:28:45.08 not just a shooting so there's some some real benefits to firearms and then I go on here but
01:28:45.08 --> 01:28:49.24 firearms are not always available there are many places in the world we're carrying a gun as
01:28:49.24 --> 01:28:53.88 illegal there are also times where firearms malfunction is also important to know how to defend
01:28:53.88 --> 01:28:58.84 yourself in on our situations which brings us back to martial arts first let me say that the
01:28:58.84 --> 01:29:04.04 martial arts are very emotional for some people their martial art becomes their religion and may
01:29:04.04 --> 01:29:10.12 become blinded by it martial arts are not static they evolve all with they evolve all the time
01:29:10.12 --> 01:29:15.32 if you do not evolve with them you will be left behind picking one martial art versus another or
01:29:15.32 --> 01:29:21.08 saying that one martial art is better than another martial art drive some people crazy I do not
01:29:21.08 --> 01:29:26.36 engage in irrational theoretical discussions on which martial art is best there's no reason to
01:29:26.36 --> 01:29:31.24 theorize anymore the ultimate fighting championship put many theories to the test the war's
01:29:31.24 --> 01:29:37.40 an Iraq and Afghanistan also put many theories to the test about hand-to-hand combat finally every
01:29:37.40 --> 01:29:42.60 person now carries a video camera in their pocket and there are thousands of street fights and
01:29:42.60 --> 01:29:48.60 confrontations to watch on the internet with all that information readily available there is no need
01:29:48.60 --> 01:29:54.20 to theorize anymore it is easy to see what works and what doesn't furthermore it is also
01:29:54.20 --> 01:29:58.84 obvious that martial arts are not stagnant they evolve people develop new techniques and new moves
01:29:58.84 --> 01:30:03.56 to counter other techniques and other moves but they but the fundamental principles do not change
01:30:03.56 --> 01:30:11.48 they only become reinforced and I give some advice here start with Brazilian jujitsu
01:30:12.52 --> 01:30:16.68 it is a form of grappling that is highly advanced because for the most part the actual fighting
01:30:16.68 --> 01:30:23.16 takes place on the ground this is a key point because our first form of self-defense is to get away yes
01:30:23.16 --> 01:30:28.84 run if you are confronted by another person or a group of people the best thing you can do is run
01:30:28.84 --> 01:30:34.92 away avoid the conflict this is relatively easy if someone is trying to strike with you or strike
01:30:34.92 --> 01:30:40.60 you with punches or kicks they do not have control over you so you can simply run away from them
01:30:40.60 --> 01:30:46.36 you have one the problem comes in a self-defense situation when someone is grabbing you
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:53.08 now they are preventing your first line of defense running as soon as someone grabs you you are in
01:30:53.08 --> 01:30:59.56 a grappling scenario and one of the most critical parts of Brazilian jujitsu is escaping someone's
01:30:59.56 --> 01:31:04.44 grip so you can run oftentimes an attacker will take you to the ground in order to prevent you
01:31:04.44 --> 01:31:10.52 from escaping their grip when this happens the ability to ground fight is used not to stay on the ground
01:31:10.52 --> 01:31:16.20 but to get up and get away from the attacker the first goal of a beginner in jujitsu is not to get
01:31:16.20 --> 01:31:22.20 the fight to the ground but to get up off the ground and get away this is an important distinction
01:31:22.20 --> 01:31:27.48 from people who believe the goal of self-defense in jujitsu is to get the attacker to the ground
01:31:27.48 --> 01:31:34.68 this is not true the goal is to get away but as has been seen over and over again fights
01:31:34.68 --> 01:31:39.64 often end up on the ground and therefore a person must be prepared for it not training in jujitsu
01:31:39.64 --> 01:31:43.56 because you don't want to go to the ground is like not learning to swim because you don't want
01:31:43.56 --> 01:31:48.52 to go in the water it doesn't make sense the safest way to deal with the water is to be comfortable
01:31:48.52 --> 01:31:53.64 in it just as being comfortable on the ground is the best way to deal with that scenario should it
01:31:53.64 --> 01:32:02.92 unfold in real life questions comments from echo trolls i agree we can reach back to your days many
01:32:02.92 --> 01:32:11.80 days on the front lines of the bouncing one yeah i agree that is yeah i agree i can't disagree at all
01:32:11.80 --> 01:32:17.24 one of the primary arguments that people give when they you know Brazilian jujitsu is no good
01:32:17.24 --> 01:32:20.20 for self-defense why would you take someone to the ground why are you taking them around
01:32:20.20 --> 01:32:23.72 that's not going to run out doing that we're trying to get away yeah so you know i have to
01:32:23.72 --> 01:32:29.000 like that the muscle when we do the jujitsu part and you notice this and you actually pointed it out
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.52 which i liked go whatever you where i said if i choose to fight this guy you know how like i'll
01:32:34.52 --> 01:32:38.36 go through the basic thing when if i come front this guy it's come front for me and i choose to fight
01:32:38.36 --> 01:32:43.08 them so it's way different than self-defense that's like i chose to fight this person and most
01:32:43.08 --> 01:32:46.92 of the time you you add in just like i said earlier where if you don't have a choice to run like
01:32:46.92 --> 01:32:52.60 in the grab your whatever there is that too for sure but yes if you choose to fight them then yeah
01:32:52.60 --> 01:32:56.52 you can take into a ground whenever now your choice to fight them is going to be based on
01:32:56.52 --> 01:33:00.52 the bunch of other things and the better be intelligent because if you're like yeah i'm at the
01:33:00.52 --> 01:33:04.76 club you said this and whatever and then you just you're fighting yeah i don't know if that's
01:33:04.76 --> 01:33:09.08 and you know uh uh the right choice and now you get a whole different issue then the self-defense
01:33:09.08 --> 01:33:12.84 situation you know that's like a choice and you made it whatever but yeah if you're you know
01:33:13.72 --> 01:33:17.56 i don't know fighting with your friend after not your friend but your enemy after school and
01:33:17.56 --> 01:33:21.64 everyone's like circle i don't know whatever there there's there's choices to be made in
01:33:21.64 --> 01:33:27.000 if the right choice is to fight the guy and then yes bring the shoes well then yeah so so then you
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:33.16 can use jiu jitsu but now you're using it in an offensive situation and so yes you probably will
01:33:33.16 --> 01:33:40.44 want to take the person to the ground yeah i mean if it's if it's a like a one on one i'm choosing
01:33:40.44 --> 01:33:43.88 to fight because if it's four on one and you're choosing to fight you're just being stupid yes
01:33:43.88 --> 01:33:49.48 you're about to get your ass beat yes or yeah the very high likely yes yeah the oh
01:33:49.48 --> 01:33:54.36 i do have a question about the firearms train like you know how you train in stressful situations
01:33:54.36 --> 01:34:00.76 what kind of stressful situations can you like put yourself in or whatever uh there's some obvious
01:34:00.76 --> 01:34:05.48 ones the most obvious one is time constraints so hey i want to get these shots off as quick as
01:34:05.48 --> 01:34:08.76 possible and i'm competing against you know echo's going against me and we're trying to see who
01:34:08.76 --> 01:34:15.32 wins there's a little bit of stress there but also hey do 30 burpees and then shoot six head blades
01:34:15.32 --> 01:34:21.88 right through your breathing hard sprint reload reload drills um this all those things that
01:34:21.88 --> 01:34:26.44 that there's a million different ways i mean you can i'm sure those were enough to kind of spark
01:34:26.44 --> 01:34:30.60 your creativity on what you can do to make it stressful yeah fully the time because i went
01:34:31.40 --> 01:34:36.28 it was the last time i went but i went to the range with keen and cornealious and we did we just
01:34:36.28 --> 01:34:41.96 did like a simple fun like contest you know kind of like shooting replay horse yeah paper
01:34:41.96 --> 01:34:46.44 what are you kind of like that kind of situation i mean i actually filmed it but the video
01:34:46.44 --> 01:34:53.000 kind of got one kill is gonna release it but that that did add a little something because it like
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.80 if you miss or you would ever it meant something kind of thing but it i didn't i'd never felt
01:34:57.80 --> 01:35:03.32 i wouldn't label it as a stressful training scenario but time constraints if it's like okay you
01:35:03.32 --> 01:35:07.72 got time it's trying to get better at it and it's a competition i mean when you're in this
01:35:07.72 --> 01:35:12.68 year themes you're doing freaking competitive shooting against every i basically all the time
01:35:12.68 --> 01:35:17.08 you're shooting against somebody where you shoot against three people or four people or whatever so
01:35:17.88 --> 01:35:21.88 you you you you have that level of stress but then it's also you know you're going to run
01:35:21.88 --> 01:35:24.60 you're going to run up that berm you're going to drag that tire you're going to come back over here
01:35:24.60 --> 01:35:26.76 you're going to shoot six head plates you're going to go back you're going to get on your
01:35:26.76 --> 01:35:31.000 long gun you're going to put down this one you got all these things that you got it and it's all
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.76 a race and they're just trying to make you freak out and then on top of that you know once you
01:35:34.76 --> 01:35:38.76 get into the sim unition now you've got you're you're you're not shooting real bullets but you're
01:35:38.76 --> 01:35:42.76 shooting you got people maneuvering you got people you know you're you're you're throwing flash
01:35:42.76 --> 01:35:47.80 glass and we got grenades going off like all kinds of mayhem and sim munition is just as loud
01:35:47.80 --> 01:35:53.16 as loud as it like night and day like night and day yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:35:53.16 --> 01:35:58.36 because that i feel like and obviously i've never been in a straight up gun fight with anyone like
01:35:58.36 --> 01:36:09.16 they're shooting at me actually that up but i would imagine that just hearing other gunshots going on
01:36:09.88 --> 01:36:14.52 and you know that they're at you or intended for you whatever that's going to just bring you out of
01:36:14.52 --> 01:36:21.24 your whole shooting game yeah the noise of gunshots it's like if you hear it a lot less and when you're
01:36:21.24 --> 01:36:26.20 when you're shooting like at somebody you're nearing the game yeah like it's a lot less
01:36:27.32 --> 01:36:32.92 a lot less it's not that it's not like the like the like the little shock that you get when you're
01:36:32.92 --> 01:36:39.56 at the range or whatever okay even even actually if you get you know you get like a good
01:36:39.56 --> 01:36:45.16 stress scenario going even in a training situation you won't really like notice big time
01:36:45.16 --> 01:36:52.68 and we used to do our drills this is back in the back in the turn they used to man this is
01:36:52.68 --> 01:36:56.52 this is i don't recommend it but they would make us do some of our immediate action drills
01:36:56.52 --> 01:37:03.08 with no your protection in so that we would like quote get used to it yeah but this allow
01:37:03.96 --> 01:37:09.16 yeah so it and that was something too that else wasn't even worth so if you're in the field straight
01:37:09.16 --> 01:37:15.16 up or alone you do you have your protection yeah you have well nowadays we have this and this is
01:37:15.16 --> 01:37:20.36 another thing that's pretty crazy is we have the headsets that are noise canceling headsets
01:37:20.36 --> 01:37:24.68 and the reason you're wearing them is because you're on the radio so it's it's your headphone
01:37:24.68 --> 01:37:30.20 for your radio so you can hear and it's a noise canceling headset so when a loud noise goes off
01:37:30.20 --> 01:37:36.44 it cancels out that noise so so okay so when was the first time you ever shot a gun
01:37:36.44 --> 01:37:44.20 in my life yeah in your life it's very like eight or nine I think maybe ten yeah
01:37:44.20 --> 01:37:50.44 something else they got to go to younger than ten but I was I was up in Maine and I went out to
01:37:50.44 --> 01:37:59.08 my friend was a little older than me we went out to his uncle's farm and shot yeah so
01:37:59.08 --> 01:38:09.48 the so you weren't like surprised by how freaking loud a gun is then no but I think I think what
01:38:09.48 --> 01:38:14.28 you're getting at is people that I don't really remember enough of like my introduction of
01:38:14.28 --> 01:38:21.16 firearms to get what you're getting at which is firearms are freaking loud way louder than anything
01:38:21.16 --> 01:38:26.60 they could portray in the movies or whatever yeah hundred percent yeah because that it just look
01:38:26.60 --> 01:38:31.96 again I've never been in a firefight but it just seems like when you imagine it where when it
01:38:31.96 --> 01:38:37.08 kicks off and you didn't kick it off with a first shot if someone else shot by the first shot seems
01:38:37.08 --> 01:38:42.68 like you just be out of the game if you're not used to it yeah well you definitely that's another
01:38:42.68 --> 01:38:51.48 thing is you get so used to gunshots in the seal teams from your training that that doesn't
01:38:51.48 --> 01:38:57.000 really like it's not a shock anymore yeah so a costume here it's not it's not shocking it's like oh
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.56 yeah that's true oh where's that coming from right yeah even like when you're also the distance you know
01:39:01.56 --> 01:39:08.60 when someone's a little bit further away from you the the shock is a lot less when you get away from it you
01:39:08.60 --> 01:39:14.92 know thanks the the the concussion of the shot yeah now if they're in the same room as you it can be
01:39:14.92 --> 01:39:23.88 pretty pretty dynamic right we should ask Mike Day oh yeah how that gonna yeah man yeah it's crazy
01:39:24.68 --> 01:39:28.60 like when okay so when you go to the gun range let's say you know it's your first time or whatever
01:39:28.60 --> 01:39:32.76 the gun range when you walk in that door and you hear other people shooting your like yeah
01:39:32.76 --> 01:39:37.40 okay so have you shot outdoors yet yeah yeah okay because it's a lot different shooting outdoors
01:39:37.40 --> 01:39:43.000 in indoors yeah a lot different yeah yeah I don't think I even it was actually the first time I shot
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.72 a gun think one of the early times anyway was was outdoors and I don't think we even had your
01:39:49.72 --> 01:39:57.96 protection and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we were shooting like some louder ones
01:39:57.96 --> 01:40:04.92 okay 45 shot done for we're shooting clay clay pigeons or whatever um and yeah I remember them
01:40:04.92 --> 01:40:11.80 being loud like for real loud even outdoors but compared to indoors it's it was nothing
01:40:11.80 --> 01:40:16.36 because if you don't wear your protection like at the regular indoor gun range like but you might
01:40:16.36 --> 01:40:19.96 know issues yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sure sure sure
01:40:19.96 --> 01:40:23.72 but it's good to condition it's good to stress condition it's good to get used to those noise
01:40:23.72 --> 01:40:27.000 it's good to get used to all those things this is well there's what we train for and we should
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.80 not just relegate training to just being in the military we should train for you know other
01:40:31.80 --> 01:40:36.44 things that can happen in life and if you are gonna have a fire I'm damn well better trained with it
01:40:36.44 --> 01:40:41.96 um going back to the jiu-jitsu thing I want to read this other little section another reason
01:40:41.96 --> 01:40:46.28 I recommend starting martial arts by learning Brazilian jiu-jitsu is because it is the most complex
01:40:46.28 --> 01:40:54.28 of the martial arts although there is a finite number of moves and positions there is an infinite
01:40:54.28 --> 01:41:01.88 number of moves beyond the basics and more developed every day in this constantly evolving art
01:41:01.88 --> 01:41:09.000 due to this unending depth in jiu-jitsu it is also the most cerebral of martial arts
01:41:09.72 --> 01:41:15.88 it provides incredible mental stimulus and a never-ending challenge to learn develop and improve
01:41:15.88 --> 01:41:20.84 jiu-jitsu never gets old the next martial art I recommend is learning boxing
01:41:21.88 --> 01:41:27.56 boxing is an incredibly effective striking art despite its relative simplicity there are only two
01:41:27.56 --> 01:41:32.28 weapons in boxing the whole f-tand in the right hand but with those two weapons and incredible
01:41:32.28 --> 01:41:37.64 advantage can be gained if you know how to throw them in effective combinations other critical elements
01:41:37.64 --> 01:41:43.80 learned in boxing our angles movement both of which are based heavily on fortwork and speed which
01:41:43.80 --> 01:41:50.12 are utilized in both both the offense and defense of boxing with basic boxing knowledge a person
01:41:50.12 --> 01:41:54.76 can throw effective punches and avoid being punched both extremely useful assets when attempting to
01:41:54.76 --> 01:42:01.32 attempt the primary goal of self defense run boxing develops the ability to hit quickly avoid being hit
01:42:01.32 --> 01:42:08.60 and run away from the area of confrontation so that's just regular western boxing
01:42:10.60 --> 01:42:14.92 and this is sort of like again this is my recommendation if you're starting from ground zero
01:42:14.92 --> 01:42:26.12 you know nothing this is how I would go about it there can be some argument made that if you were going
01:42:26.12 --> 01:42:34.92 to a place tomorrow that you needed to be ready to begin attacked then maybe like you look at
01:42:34.92 --> 01:42:43.48 some other form of martial arts but if that's your situation like it's not smart I mean and you
01:42:43.48 --> 01:42:48.04 know by that I mean some of these I don't even know if that's a true statement yeah I mean it's
01:42:48.04 --> 01:42:52.04 what I think it might be I think it is one of the statements where it just straight up depends
01:42:52.68 --> 01:42:56.12 so depends on what what do you mean you're going to be attacked like just by a person and is
01:42:56.12 --> 01:42:59.88 that person be trained or not untrained or they be bigger than you or they can be equal sized
01:42:59.88 --> 01:43:05.32 of you know or smaller or weapons or yeah and then it depends on who like okay you might learn
01:43:05.32 --> 01:43:10.44 you know and what is it like okay you might need these these kind of blitz martial arts type
01:43:10.44 --> 01:43:15.80 situation like a crowd from a god you know or whatever whatever some cool system I think I would
01:43:15.80 --> 01:43:19.80 in a read actually told me that I think in a read was like you know if you had like one day
01:43:20.68 --> 01:43:25.32 I would teach somebody some basic crowd from a god stuff yeah and and that could be true for sure
01:43:25.32 --> 01:43:30.68 if you know if the the instructors teaching you for that reason yeah you just got one day let's
01:43:30.68 --> 01:43:35.88 pack it in or and then even a jujitsu scenario here's a problem of that statement now that I think
01:43:35.88 --> 01:43:40.76 through it in my opinion the problem of that statement is if you really think that that one day is
01:43:40.76 --> 01:43:46.04 going to help you you're an idiot yeah like if I be the best you could do but it only going to
01:43:46.04 --> 01:43:51.32 give you a 1% better chance than you know so don't get yourself in that situation that's why
01:43:51.32 --> 01:43:56.84 you make martial arts a part of your life yeah it's it's got to be a life thing yeah but the
01:43:56.84 --> 01:44:02.04 thing is that is a thing though where like even Tim Ferriss sort of studies it a little bit
01:44:02.04 --> 01:44:06.12 remember like because he took a thing a jujitsu thing where he was like hey I need to know that the
01:44:06.12 --> 01:44:11.000 most that I possibly can to be affected in the small short of this was like a TV show right
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.32 it was yeah I was like one of the things yeah and I was like oh that's an interesting theory
01:44:15.32 --> 01:44:19.48 because that's not the way you change a jujitsu at all and you know they taught him like the
01:44:19.48 --> 01:44:23.48 guillotine was one of them that they taught because there's not all these like factors you
01:44:23.48 --> 01:44:28.04 have to kind of establish before you can execute to move or not as many or whatever that was kind
01:44:28.04 --> 01:44:33.72 of the thing and anyway the point is it introduced like an interesting approach to these things
01:44:33.72 --> 01:44:39.08 this real short term approach how can I get the most effectiveness out of it if I only have a short
01:44:39.08 --> 01:44:45.24 amount of time rather than infinite time you know so yeah yeah that's cool because you could also
01:44:45.24 --> 01:44:51.24 that that would be it be if you made if someone said I'm gonna go to this place tomorrow and there's
01:44:51.24 --> 01:44:56.12 a high likelihood I got attacked I would be taking I would I would be taking very small parts of
01:44:56.12 --> 01:45:00.76 various martial arts yeah that's what I think I would do but again I don't want to make that sound
01:45:00.76 --> 01:45:04.44 like its a solution because I don't want to sound like the freaking magazines to say defeat any attack
01:45:04.44 --> 01:45:09.72 and move to three moves it's a lie straight up it's a lie straight up don't think of it that way
01:45:09.72 --> 01:45:14.60 don't even forget I just said that here's the deal make martial arts a part of your life
01:45:15.32 --> 01:45:20.68 that's what you need to do back to the book the next two martial arts to invest time into our
01:45:20.68 --> 01:45:27.72 Moitai and wrestling they both add a plethora of options and skills to any fighter wrestling
01:45:28.28 --> 01:45:34.20 wrestling is a grappling art perhaps the most widely known in practice look I go through a
01:45:34.20 --> 01:45:40.84 bunch of stuff and I talk about Moitai and Moitai is awesome I think the reason that I put
01:45:41.40 --> 01:45:46.28 that I would train someone in boxing first before Moitai is just for the complexities like
01:45:46.28 --> 01:45:49.40 Moitai is just that much more complex you can throw out both you can throw knees you can throw
01:45:49.40 --> 01:45:54.28 kicks there's a lot more things to learn so the first thing I want to learn is how to throw hands
01:45:54.84 --> 01:45:59.64 you know how to throw hands get head movement get angles work distance like that's all going to come
01:45:59.64 --> 01:46:06.68 from just boxing without opening up because look I mean Moitai is savage bro Moitai is savage
01:46:07.72 --> 01:46:13.48 yeah that's one of the pain that's what I was going to say like that's what you get taught as well
01:46:13.48 --> 01:46:19.72 and not like a secondary teaching like one of the primary thinking is like kind of how fragile you are
01:46:19.72 --> 01:46:24.68 with pain where the kind of like okay or how much you can get used to it too exactly right that's
01:46:24.68 --> 01:46:29.64 part of the training you know that's what you do benefit from taking that pain like ribs legs is a
01:46:29.64 --> 01:46:37.16 huge one man like a leg kick body kick punch even when you kick somebody and it lands in the wrong
01:46:37.16 --> 01:46:45.56 spot but it's like hurts it's it's worse than most hits that you get like if you get punched in the
01:46:45.56 --> 01:46:50.12 face let's face it I mean it seems crazy whatever but it doesn't hurt that much even if you
01:46:50.12 --> 01:46:54.44 really get a good one it more knocks you like dizzy more than it actually is pain
01:46:55.16 --> 01:47:01.48 Moitai is straight up pain in a way sometimes you kind of wish you'd stop punching me below the
01:47:01.48 --> 01:47:07.000 freaking net or kicking one of just punch me in the face that's way better way more is
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.44 really really you know sometimes but yeah you get used to that and that kind of training is very
01:47:12.44 --> 01:47:17.64 beneficial because men you kick even in like a real fighter whatever you give if you can
01:47:18.28 --> 01:47:23.32 effectively like leg kick somebody two even three times or something like this and they feel that pain
01:47:23.32 --> 01:47:28.04 like bro I want to watch the guy you're like oh you don't know like I got kicked on like you
01:47:28.04 --> 01:47:33.16 think no big deal you don't know no here actually I was like trying to think what I said
01:47:33.16 --> 01:47:37.40 Moitai adds a massive arsenal of striking options to a fighter where boxing utilize is only two
01:47:37.40 --> 01:47:41.80 fists Moitai utilize his fist elbows knees and the shins in very aggressive combinations that are
01:47:41.80 --> 01:47:47.32 absolutely devastating in a fight Moitai is also about pain and the ability to withstand pain
01:47:48.60 --> 01:47:56.20 legit talk about shame conditioning in there so definitely look Moitai awesome wrestling
01:47:56.20 --> 01:48:04.52 clearly is just freaking awesome um wrestling is a grappling art the physical grind of wrestling
01:48:04.52 --> 01:48:12.44 hardens the body and mind without mercy on top of the conditioning and mental toughness
01:48:12.44 --> 01:48:16.12 derived from wrestling it is also the king of position in martial arts and we see this from the
01:48:16.12 --> 01:48:21.96 UFC this is why the rest of us dominate in the UFC meaning a good wrestler can decide what position
01:48:21.96 --> 01:48:27.40 they will be in during a competition no other martial art provides a practitioner a better ability
01:48:27.40 --> 01:48:32.12 to dictate the position of a fight with one simple idea the main focus of wrestling is to get
01:48:32.12 --> 01:48:39.48 the opponent to the ground and keep them there so then I say once a good base is and again there's
01:48:39.48 --> 01:48:43.96 a bunch of details on wrestling on Moitai on boxing once a good base is established in Brazilian
01:48:43.96 --> 01:48:52.52 institutes boxing wrestling and Moitai there are plenty of other martial arts to explore judo is a fantastic
01:48:52.52 --> 01:48:56.04 art and has very effective take down especially against opponent wearing a jacket or shirt
01:48:58.52 --> 01:49:03.88 sombo what talk about krav maga i talk about screaming kali and the dog brothers you know
01:49:03.88 --> 01:49:09.96 dog brothers vaguely yes the dog brothers are legit about as legit as it gets
01:49:09.96 --> 01:49:15.24 a they and they've been around for a long time but for those of you that don't know the dog
01:49:15.24 --> 01:49:23.72 brothers they would have these fights with weapons and basically you would wear the guys would wear
01:49:24.68 --> 01:49:29.80 like lacrosse gloves i guess to protect their fingers and they would wear
01:49:30.68 --> 01:49:37.08 some kind of like hockey helmet to protect their heads and then they would use various weapons
01:49:37.08 --> 01:49:44.12 they would use sticks they would use chains they would use canes just all and they would go at it
01:49:44.12 --> 01:49:47.72 like they would fight like they would fight and you could tap out but they were gonna fight you
01:49:47.72 --> 01:49:52.68 were gonna get hit and you can go watch those videos of dog brothers but what was cool about is they
01:49:52.68 --> 01:49:58.04 may be around for a very long time and it was the most realistic you know it's the most realistic
01:49:58.04 --> 01:50:04.84 weapons fighting i think that that that i've seen and and then they would try and learn from it
01:50:04.84 --> 01:50:09.56 and all that so very cool stuff that they taught and trained in and then i say the list
01:50:09.56 --> 01:50:13.72 you go on and on there's there's no reason to ever stop training in learning martial arts
01:50:14.76 --> 01:50:19.32 of course it is good to be prepared to handle a self defense situation but the benefits of
01:50:19.32 --> 01:50:23.40 martial arts training go far beyond self defense of course you get physically conditioned you also
01:50:23.40 --> 01:50:29.72 get mentally tougher real martial arts are hard they they are a mental and physical grind
01:50:29.72 --> 01:50:38.12 if the martial art you are training in as easy it isn't likely doing much good martial arts also
01:50:38.12 --> 01:50:42.04 get you used to being a non comfortable situations and continuing to fight on this is an
01:50:42.04 --> 01:50:47.88 important in any endeavor martial arts will make you better so train don't think about it don't take
01:50:47.88 --> 01:50:52.76 time to get in shape before you start just go start the rest will come and then i have a whole
01:50:52.76 --> 01:50:58.44 section in here about where to train what type of academy what are you looking for thank god the
01:50:58.44 --> 01:51:02.92 world is improving where this jujitsu everywhere now look we're gonna get through this COVID thing
01:51:02.92 --> 01:51:10.68 here shortly and all the jujitsu jams will be back open have a section in here on a immediate action
01:51:10.68 --> 01:51:16.92 drills facing a threat so i'm like talking about what you actually do when bad things are happening
01:51:16.92 --> 01:51:22.28 you know we get mass shooting situations we got all kinds of problems out there and you know
01:51:22.28 --> 01:51:31.08 I wanted to talk about how you handle those situations the next section by the hit every
01:51:31.08 --> 01:51:37.72 controversial the next section is called feeding the machine and the first section in here and by
01:51:37.72 --> 01:51:41.88 the way you know everyone's gonna comment about you know it's funny is like people comment you
01:51:41.88 --> 01:51:46.92 know we've had some some excerpts put out from us talking about martial arts and there's people
01:51:46.92 --> 01:51:50.60 that would say would call out certain things now read through the comments and oh yeah that's
01:51:50.60 --> 01:51:55.72 well that's actually accurate i i shouldn't have said that right i didn't mention that or whatever so
01:51:55.72 --> 01:52:02.28 if you're gonna get all ham if you get all ham in the comments go for it and uh we'll maybe
01:52:02.28 --> 01:52:07.48 we'll address them on the grounded podcast but um some good points are made in there and like i
01:52:07.48 --> 01:52:13.32 said these are these are if if you consider your martial art a religion and something that i said
01:52:13.32 --> 01:52:18.84 i tacked your religion if you're a diehard mojtai and you think that i'm saying that jujitsu is
01:52:18.84 --> 01:52:25.16 better you know like and you want to bring it i'm sorry i mean it's just this is my thoughts you
01:52:25.16 --> 01:52:31.64 can disagree that's cool mojtai is awesome wrestling is awesome boxing is awesome you jujitsu is awesome
01:52:32.76 --> 01:52:39.64 i love them all train them all it's all good but it's controversial for some people yes some people
01:52:39.64 --> 01:52:48.60 it's a religion if you gotta be careful that so when talking about fuel like what we are
01:52:48.60 --> 01:52:55.24 going to eat this is another thing that can become you know kind of controversial and people get
01:52:55.24 --> 01:53:02.52 crazy on i got a section here says addicted to sugar sugar is truly addictive it stimulates the
01:53:02.52 --> 01:53:09.88 same parts of the brain as heroin and cocaine when you have it you want more of it and you know this
01:53:09.88 --> 01:53:16.04 to be true that's why you can't stop eating it and when you do stop eating it you will feel with
01:53:16.04 --> 01:53:24.52 troll headache irritation anxiety lies the lies will come and they will come from you the lies
01:53:24.52 --> 01:53:30.28 you tell yourself are it's no big deal i can just have a little it isn't worth it to feel this
01:53:30.28 --> 01:53:37.72 bad the body needs carbs you will rationalize and start to listen to lies don't stay strong get off
01:53:37.72 --> 01:53:48.04 the sugar train get off the addiction stop eating sugar cocaine and heroin people don't you know
01:53:48.04 --> 01:54:00.28 what the rat's eat ah fuel look i talk about i talk about what to eat and again this is a religion for
01:54:00.28 --> 01:54:06.52 some people for a lot of people it's a religion i kind of you know hey here's what i think here's
01:54:06.52 --> 01:54:11.96 what i eat you know i eat these things beef poultry fish eggs not subedged the pulse
01:54:13.56 --> 01:54:22.20 fungi roots some dairy limited fruits are you want to get crazy on that cool you want to attack me cool
01:54:22.20 --> 01:54:31.88 kind of fungi your mushrooms I guess and ringworm I guess i'll have a double ringworm sandwich please
01:54:31.88 --> 01:54:39.64 uh don't eat these grains potatoes refined salt refined sugar processed oils right so it's just
01:54:40.84 --> 01:54:52.76 basic stuff let's not get crazy um fasting talk about fasting this section starts off news flash you don't
01:54:52.76 --> 01:55:00.44 have to eat fasting is a gift actually my dot my resting my middle daughter of that Russell
01:55:00.44 --> 01:55:06.52 she told me she would think about this because when she would be cutting weight she'd be thinking
01:55:06.52 --> 01:55:13.16 she would think but i talk about in here you know the human body can live for a long time here we go
01:55:13.16 --> 01:55:17.64 humans can survive 30 days without food you can make it in extra few hours you can actually make it a
01:55:17.64 --> 01:55:23.56 few days without any issue i fast 24 hours regularly i do 72 hours fast approximately every three
01:55:23.56 --> 01:55:28.52 months and you know what they aren't that big of a deal when i'm fasting i still do everything i would normally
01:55:28.52 --> 01:55:36.36 do if i were eating i would work out i train you did to i drink water some tea maybe eat some sunflower
01:55:36.36 --> 01:55:40.36 seeds poop freak you're not fasting you ate a sunflower seed that's what i do
01:55:42.76 --> 01:55:49.56 like take it easy uh so i have something to chew on but fasting isn't that hard and you will
01:55:49.56 --> 01:55:55.08 feel better at the end of it this is my favorite thing fasting will recalibrate what hunger is to you
01:55:55.08 --> 01:56:00.68 you'll realize that you aren't actually hungry most of the time you're just bored and at the end of
01:56:00.68 --> 01:56:05.24 a fast your food will taste better too that is a factual beautiful thing food tastes good
01:56:06.12 --> 01:56:12.52 when you uh when you do that so a whole section on fasting a bunch of benefits from that got a
01:56:12.52 --> 01:56:21.000 section here dealing with injuries and illness you are going to get injured you are going to get sick
01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.20 regardless of how careful you are in training you how clean you eat and how healthy you live
01:56:26.20 --> 01:56:31.88 you are still human injuries and illness will occur my theory for overcoming injuries and illness
01:56:31.88 --> 01:56:38.44 is simple do what you can if you're sick or injured don't use that as an excuse to skip or
01:56:38.44 --> 01:56:44.44 workouts or stay in bed all day do what you can hurt your knee work your upper body work the good
01:56:44.44 --> 01:56:50.04 leg hurt your shoulder time to work on one arm pull up some pushups focus on your core and legs
01:56:50.04 --> 01:56:54.36 until your shoulder heals up 10 to 90s from using your grip too much sounds like it's time to
01:56:54.36 --> 01:57:00.60 focus on sprinting and jumping the plyometrics got a little cold flu same thing do what you can
01:57:00.60 --> 01:57:04.84 maybe it's just going for a walk a couple sets of situps and pushups but don't just stay in bed
01:57:04.84 --> 01:57:11.80 all day now sometimes you get playing knocked out by illness or a virus if it is that bad and
01:57:11.80 --> 01:57:17.72 your body absolutely needs rest good listen to your body and take the rest also don't bring your
01:57:17.72 --> 01:57:22.20 disease to the gym and spread it around work out at home same thing with injuries if some
01:57:22.20 --> 01:57:27.56 injury prevents you from doing the physical things you like to do good do what you can work on some
01:57:27.56 --> 01:57:33.96 skills you can do pick up a guitar write a book draw paint compose a song blog
01:57:34.52 --> 01:57:40.28 create learn do something take advantage of physical injuries and sickness by doing something you
01:57:40.28 --> 01:57:49.64 don't normally have time for in other words get after it and I recently did that when I got
01:57:49.64 --> 01:57:56.36 COVID I was like oh cool I can't I can't literally leave my house apparently not supposed to
01:57:56.36 --> 01:58:03.40 interact with anybody so and everybody kind of knew I had it so it's cool and I just like playing
01:58:03.40 --> 01:58:09.64 guitar a bunch and started digging into all bunch I've been I've been playing guitar for 35
01:58:09.64 --> 01:58:14.92 years and I've been at the same level for about 34 and half years and in the past two weeks
01:58:16.12 --> 01:58:22.60 I've advanced 10 fold on my understanding so this isn't just me saying this is actually
01:58:22.60 --> 01:58:28.76 something to do more you do that to the more you get used to that protocol you know where
01:58:29.64 --> 01:58:34.84 you know how like sometimes like your workouts or your whatever is like that's like your main
01:58:34.84 --> 01:58:40.76 jam like and then you get hurt and then you're all you know you can get depressed or just be so
01:58:40.76 --> 01:58:45.56 unhappy that you're out of game can't change you get to and people get awful but if you're
01:58:45.56 --> 01:58:50.12 used to that protocol where it's like it essentially opens up opportunity for new
01:58:50.12 --> 01:58:54.68 developments and growth you know for yourself literally making you a better person right so
01:58:54.68 --> 01:58:58.60 that becomes a protocol a normal protocol when you get injured it's automatic you're like okay
01:58:58.60 --> 01:59:03.64 I'm injured hey whatever junk but whatever and then this protocol kind of ensues
01:59:03.64 --> 01:59:08.28 and then boom you're kind of like you're kind of into that for a little bit yeah because getting injured
01:59:10.28 --> 01:59:16.28 it's for people like you for people like me that are really like do physical stuff
01:59:16.28 --> 01:59:22.44 getting injured is so horrible but I I will say I have this protocol when I'm like a cool
01:59:23.32 --> 01:59:28.68 when I when I do remember when I heard my elbow like Dean from the bank in my elbow
01:59:28.68 --> 01:59:34.36 I mean I was in a sling I've never been to sling in my life but like the next day or maybe it was
01:59:34.36 --> 01:59:40.04 one day later like at first I couldn't even do anything but then I was in doing one arm kettlebell
01:59:40.04 --> 01:59:44.36 swing snatches and stuff else like okay cool what you're gonna work through this it'll get better
01:59:44.36 --> 01:59:48.52 over time that's what's gonna take but whatever it's like a cut like even couldn't play guitar though
01:59:49.24 --> 01:59:56.36 damn pro brutal the initiating like the the first thing you do is essentially see what you can
01:59:56.36 --> 02:00:00.84 do and can't do and then from there you just go forward where it's like yeah you do what you can
02:00:00.84 --> 02:00:06.76 physically but we know that's not kind of it's hard to be like mentally on that same level as
02:00:06.76 --> 02:00:11.000 far as like your enthusiasm to pursue work out surgery, get through whatever when you're just doing
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:17.24 what you can do especially if it's a significant injury but if you can do this other stuff now you know
02:00:17.96 --> 02:00:21.96 you can focus on other stuff or whatever you have like yeah and you just gonna mission who you are
02:00:21.96 --> 02:00:29.32 in your mission you mission you mission straight up there's a whole section like I said appendix
02:00:29.32 --> 02:00:34.84 is just all kinds of workouts from beginner workouts that literally any human being can do
02:00:34.84 --> 02:00:42.36 to advance workouts that will crush whoever and they're all written down in there and then
02:00:43.64 --> 02:00:48.28 well let me just read the last page of this book let's give it away the spoiler
02:00:48.28 --> 02:00:57.64 the section called do and it says don't just read this book don't just listen to the podcast
02:00:57.64 --> 02:01:05.40 don't just watch videos online don't just take notes don't just study them don't just share
02:01:05.40 --> 02:01:13.08 them with your friends don't just plan don't just mark your calendar don't just get motivated
02:01:13.08 --> 02:01:26.20 don't just talk don't just think don't just dream no none of that matters the only thing that
02:01:26.20 --> 02:01:43.08 matters is that you actually do so do and there you go that's that's the book and
02:01:46.04 --> 02:01:51.88 you know I think that this book obviously as I started off this book is something that
02:01:51.88 --> 02:02:00.28 anyone can use it something that I actually use something that I have used in dire situations to
02:02:00.28 --> 02:02:06.28 help me and something I use on a daily situation to help me something that something that we could
02:02:06.28 --> 02:02:15.80 all use to look at to remind us to keep us on the path it's a very present sense of message do you
02:02:15.80 --> 02:02:23.80 like that it's very present sense of message yeah I do like that thank you just there looking at you
02:02:25.16 --> 02:02:34.36 sending a message and the message is disappointing was freedom so get after it
02:02:34.36 --> 02:02:45.96 so echo we we want to get after it do you have any recommendations on how we do that or how
02:02:45.96 --> 02:02:54.60 we can keep doing that. this book is like the ultimate like New Year's book you know people
02:02:54.60 --> 02:03:01.16 they'll make like the New Year's Resolution you know but usually because you know how they say like
02:03:01.16 --> 02:03:05.88 a lot of most whatever I don't know that number like resolutions they'll fail after whatever
02:03:05.88 --> 02:03:11.72 amount of times. yeah something's something yeah but think when you think about it when you have
02:03:11.72 --> 02:03:18.68 the manual you don't have to it doesn't have to fail like you just refer to the manual it's a you know
02:03:18.68 --> 02:03:28.76 it's a thing rather than let's face it it was like when you make a New Year's Resolution it's kind
02:03:28.76 --> 02:03:33.32 of like oh I just sort of intend to get in shape you don't have a path on the plan of full
02:03:33.32 --> 02:03:40.12 action you know you just have an intention boom you got it right there you know so one of those things
02:03:40.12 --> 02:03:45.08 in fact I would argue that if you're like okay this is my kind of like I was saying with the owners
02:03:45.08 --> 02:03:51.40 manual of a car if you just if you have this and you treat it as your owner's manual for your
02:03:52.20 --> 02:03:57.64 New Year's Resolution or for your life in general it should be for your life in general yes but I'm
02:03:57.64 --> 02:04:01.88 saying if you want to slide it in and have it serve that particular purpose how are the moment
02:04:03.08 --> 02:04:09.48 I like you know what I think is cool is giving it this on one give the gift of discipline
02:04:12.68 --> 02:04:17.24 give the gift of discipline just make me wish freedom field manual Markorn motto oh by the way
02:04:17.24 --> 02:04:23.000 the name of this is Markorn motto that's from the military term it's when they modify things
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:29.64 here so the mark one is like this is the first model of it then mod one is the first modification
02:04:29.64 --> 02:04:34.36 the first mod that they make so there's a modification to this one my head is bigger on the cover
02:04:35.08 --> 02:04:39.72 yeah that's the mod right there wait wait wait wait wait what is Mark one what is Mark one is it's like
02:04:39.72 --> 02:04:46.68 a model number yeah but they just call them mark yeah it's in the Navy yeah well it's in
02:04:46.68 --> 02:04:53.64 cameras as well so you got the cannon so cannon 5D mark I'm going to the one for the have
02:04:55.40 --> 02:05:02.60 Mark one okay so cannon 5D Mark one then this Mark two and then this Mark three got it
02:05:02.60 --> 02:05:07.72 yeah so they could have said Mark one and if they made like small changes to it probably
02:05:07.72 --> 02:05:15.48 mod one if they did like a full revamp then it's Mark two yeah so you could get you know a weapon system
02:05:15.48 --> 02:05:20.60 sure that it is the mark one it's the but then they add a new front sight to it you're like
02:05:20.60 --> 02:05:25.40 okay this Mark one mod one still one they add a new rear sight and it's like oh Mark one
02:05:25.40 --> 02:05:31.56 mod two so you can keep doing that so this this field manual and what's cool I will say
02:05:31.56 --> 02:05:39.80 I have a lot of what is it creative control so my publisher I said yes gonna be Mark one mod one
02:05:39.80 --> 02:05:43.72 that what's there like they didn't have any idea what this is I might as well say they're
02:05:43.72 --> 02:05:47.56 Google Blue they're like they're not like you wouldn't talk about but they're going
02:05:47.56 --> 02:05:52.68 yeah so credit it does sound cool Mark one mod one yeah well I'm glad you think it sounds cool
02:05:52.68 --> 02:05:59.80 better than Google Blue is tactical but the Mark okay so you you would actually not
02:05:59.80 --> 02:06:05.72 to spend go too deep on this Mark one mod one ummm workings but okay so what what's it
02:06:05.72 --> 02:06:12.36 because you said the guns before something Mark one like what which gun no we don't the guns
02:06:12.36 --> 02:06:20.76 are actually army weapons some markers from like the navy yeah but you like what was the okay what
02:06:20.76 --> 02:06:26.36 machine gun did you hear why can't we have four M4 there you go that was the one yeah the army
02:06:26.36 --> 02:06:33.96 it's just M though it's not Mark also M4 is Mark 4 no no M4 is the gun and then it's Mark one
02:06:33.96 --> 02:06:40.60 no they don't even do it with guns it's like a more of a navy term good yeah well they do it
02:06:40.60 --> 02:06:47.48 with camera straight out I have a boat called the Mark 5 okay all right well I'm gonna leave that to
02:06:47.48 --> 02:06:52.68 the navy and the weapon system scenario and cameras by the way because I don't know if I have
02:06:52.68 --> 02:07:00.68 grasp on it yet but I'll tell you what I do have a grasp on it's how we can all stay stay on the
02:07:00.68 --> 02:07:07.24 path or get on the path if you not on the path already when you're on the path you're gonna find
02:07:07.24 --> 02:07:11.48 out that it's hard it's not always easy it's actually not even always hard technically
02:07:12.68 --> 02:07:17.80 but it does get hard from time to time sometimes you need assistance sometimes you need supplementation
02:07:17.80 --> 02:07:25.80 and it's true jocquoise has us covered jocquoise fuel okay so if your if your joints are in need
02:07:25.80 --> 02:07:31.88 of supplementation with that joint supplements joint warfare what's called first one super
02:07:31.88 --> 02:07:39.80 krill oil it's the second one for your joints but we want to blend into immunity stuff we got vitamin D
02:07:39.80 --> 02:07:48.44 three also cold war boom joints immunity covered don't even think about those anymore put that
02:07:48.44 --> 02:07:54.52 into your daily discipline routine every morning or every night whatever boom you don't got
02:07:54.52 --> 02:08:02.36 to worry about that can stuff anymore also discipline and discipline go now this is a cognitive
02:08:02.36 --> 02:08:09.56 supplement similar to what sleep does really you talked about brain derived new tropic factor number
02:08:09.56 --> 02:08:17.40 99 or whatever you're saying it's kind of the same thing this is number 100 mark mark 100 over here
02:08:17.40 --> 02:08:25.80 either way it's kind of the same thing really yeah 100% bro that's coming up even some hardcore
02:08:25.80 --> 02:08:30.04 bro science I hit you with bro science today they're coming back and I like it and it's part of
02:08:30.04 --> 02:08:35.16 the game so part of the game nonetheless so discipline discipline go you know enhance your mind
02:08:35.16 --> 02:08:39.80 helps your cognitive abilities and physical abilities by the way many different modes that you
02:08:39.80 --> 02:08:45.56 um was a term you I'll get you primed right now which is the word you said I primed sir get the
02:08:45.56 --> 02:08:51.40 cognitive physical mental priming going on get your get a can of discipline go get the get the pill get
02:08:51.40 --> 02:08:57.56 the powder so before workouts I like the powder for that priming effect because there's there's
02:08:57.56 --> 02:09:02.36 regular priming and then there's like the secondary priming effect maybe or maybe more accurately
02:09:02.36 --> 02:09:11.56 put the psychological priming effect because you mix up the little discipline mix mega mix whatever
02:09:11.56 --> 02:09:16.28 mix it up and when you're drinking it it's like your mind is just just just getting ready
02:09:16.28 --> 02:09:21.08 psychologically not to mention all the physiological benefits you can say so it's like one on top of
02:09:21.08 --> 02:09:29.88 the other anyway it's part of the game but if you want to replace your current energy drink problem
02:09:29.88 --> 02:09:38.36 that's what it is. It's not even potentially it's a problem if you're drinking energy drinks
02:09:38.36 --> 02:09:43.08 normal energy it's a problem it's a problem because you're gonna sugar you're getting an overdose
02:09:43.08 --> 02:09:46.28 of caffeine you're gonna punch a chemicals in there that they use to preserve but there's like it's
02:09:46.28 --> 02:09:52.20 it's a absolutely it's a problem. Yeah okay I was gonna talk about this you know I'm gonna do it
02:09:52.20 --> 02:09:57.80 I'm gonna talk about it so anyway my kids watch this show I think it's called the victorious
02:09:57.80 --> 02:10:03.88 yes this show you'll never know this show ever yep I know you're young as daughter might actually
02:10:03.88 --> 02:10:08.84 watch it you said I will never know it and I said yes I will not I may not know you might over here
02:10:08.84 --> 02:10:14.52 it or what anyway it's kind of funny little show called victorious uh Ariana Grande's in it
02:10:14.52 --> 02:10:21.96 and Tor Tori don't look at me for help you know you know Tori's anyway they're from anyway
02:10:21.96 --> 02:10:28.52 um and so here's here's the thing here's an issue with all there not the issues are complex
02:10:28.52 --> 02:10:32.28 story kind of I'm trying to remember why you've been brought up but okay okay this is why so
02:10:32.28 --> 02:10:37.40 so my every time there's like a brand in there they go real odd they do a good job but it's real
02:10:37.40 --> 02:10:41.96 obvious what brand they're portraying but it's okay okay they'll have an apple computer but
02:10:41.96 --> 02:10:46.60 and it looks like an apple computer but instead of an apple it's a pair yeah so like instead of
02:10:46.60 --> 02:10:50.28 like AirPods they'll have a pair pods you know like it's real obvious right they do that with the
02:10:50.28 --> 02:10:55.80 brands they'll have a generic version of the brand just it can throw out the show right one episode
02:10:56.92 --> 02:11:01.96 there this one was actually a kind of like a little political episode almost a little freedom situation
02:11:02.76 --> 02:11:11.16 so they had this drink you soda called blue dog blue dog drink and then a guy from the
02:11:11.16 --> 02:11:18.28 FBI the federal bureau of interference came in and said hey we're getting rid of all it's
02:11:18.28 --> 02:11:24.36 we're banning it prohibition style we're taking off all the shelves and all the kids wage and
02:11:24.36 --> 02:11:28.92 before they wage this campaigning and hey it's that if it's freedom you know like people you know
02:11:28.92 --> 02:11:34.12 you shouldn't ban it for everyone just as certain people can't make choices whatever but what they
02:11:34.12 --> 02:11:39.000 did was they started making their own knockoff red dog soda and then they got busted and then
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:45.96 anyway it was a thing right here's the thing here's a point I hope so we know what red or not red dog
02:11:45.96 --> 02:11:50.60 sorry blue dog you know what brand they're portraying yes I think that's pretty probably some
02:11:50.60 --> 02:11:58.92 energy drinks scenario is going on right that's what they're talking about so with our current in
02:11:58.92 --> 02:12:04.60 real life energy drinks scenario hey we have the freedom to drink whatever we want to drink
02:12:05.72 --> 02:12:12.04 but I think it would benefit everyone including yourself to make the right choice with that freedom
02:12:12.04 --> 02:12:18.04 now if energy drinks are your weakness hey that's no problem now now it's not a problem you just
02:12:18.04 --> 02:12:24.68 switch over to the discipline go in and can so it feels all that good energy drink right
02:12:24.68 --> 02:12:29.56 curie and there's not many but it fulfills all of them which is you get some energy from it
02:12:29.56 --> 02:12:35.16 but now instead of killing yourself in the same time literally by the way slowly literally
02:12:36.28 --> 02:12:41.64 you're helping yourself and improving your health well I would love to add something to this
02:12:41.64 --> 02:12:47.88 but no one's listening anymore I think that's how they will just go and figure us out
02:12:47.88 --> 02:12:52.12 oh yeah you can get this stuff at origin main dot com you can get this stuff at the
02:12:52.12 --> 02:12:56.04 vitamin shop you can get this stuff out you can get the drinks out wall wall by the way we'll
02:12:56.04 --> 02:13:04.12 be alive in wall wall whole east coast every store January 4th epic that's due in large part
02:13:04.12 --> 02:13:09.88 two troopers in Florida that went into the wall was and cleared shelves keep it up
02:13:09.88 --> 02:13:17.64 keep it up because from wall wall when when other stores see what we're doing in wall wall
02:13:17.64 --> 02:13:22.44 we'll get nationwide to now east coast west coast if you're on the east coast and you're going

02:13:40.44 --> 02:13:47.88 colors we don't want to rely on the federal bureau of interference to get rid of unhealthy stuff
02:13:47.88 --> 02:13:52.76 we just do it we don't make the market do it yes making good decisions that's what we want to do

02:18:13.80 --> 02:18:19.40 no it's you know it's the basic stuff anyway it's just a good way to represent got some hats on there as
02:18:19.40 --> 02:18:28.52 well some women stuff also on jocco store dot com we have a exclusive I'm using that word loosely
02:18:28.52 --> 02:18:35.64 but it's a club currently called the t-shirt club okay I get we don't like that name super original yeah
02:18:35.64 --> 02:18:39.80 I made that name up too because I was like I'm just gonna be a tape into the creative zone that's
02:18:39.80 --> 02:18:46.04 I tried to pull it up a word that's weird how that backfire down me huh it's weird what's weird is
02:18:46.04 --> 02:18:51.24 when when I come up with a name that's sort of like what it is it's cool when you come up with a
02:18:51.24 --> 02:18:56.04 name that's sort of what it is it's lame yeah yeah I mean like leadership strategy and tactics
02:18:56.04 --> 02:19:00.68 field manual that is the that is what this book is this is the leadership leadership strategy
02:19:00.68 --> 02:19:03.96 and tactics field manual that's what the book is that's what I call the book there you go this

02:19:26.68 --> 02:19:32.12 did and that's fine but at the end of the day you are correct if I tried to pull a jocco I'm not
