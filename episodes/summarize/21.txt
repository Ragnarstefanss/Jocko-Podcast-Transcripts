If I went to a range and shot in like a vacuum, you know like where it's like air condition and like you guys like all right. You know, if you can't have beauty with, unless you know what ugly looks like, true, you know, you can't have hot, if you don't know what cold feels like. So while my kit is normally like 20, 30 pounds, I then have a backpack with like 20 grenades because sometimes I'm like, I'm going to flash being this room and sometimes I'm like, I'm going to fry it because I don't want to do it outside. Like we know, like this isn't just some memorial, you know, we need to sacrifice that you're talking about, it's, there's a different level of, you know, we're talking about intimacy, the brothers, and when we say it's about the dude standing next to us, it's not just some dude. You know, like these calcers cut off, you know, like weekly, it's from hard work, you know? But it's when I got to the recruiter's office, when I thought I was like this awesome American again, taking my say at a self like, oh, I'm so cool that I'm going to go do this, you know, like how selfless of me. I always like to figure out, like when I read about war, I like to think about the psychology of what's happening with the guys, especially from a leadership in a follow or perspective of what guys were thinking because that to me was always the most fascinating thing about what was going down. I mean, if like the sheep war really tight pants, flannels, had beards and never carried an axe before, didn't know how to change the oil, didn't know how to break down a gun, didn't know how to clean an animal, let alone kill it. And then through the course of trying to figure out, you know, their Azvab score and your GT score, being a college athlete, you know, like what the right fit was, I wanted to fastest thing to get me behind a gun with people that wanted to kill bad people. You know, it's our humanity, you know, and that's, and my appreciation, my beautiful wife and my kids, you know, loving Austin, Texas, and barbecue and motorcycles, like that's normal to me. You know, you want to just like to lose him, you know, do you know what we had? Yeah, you know, I know what your fart smell like, woman, I know what his favorite panties were on you. You know, I'm like, when Army plays Navy, like, I don't know crap about football. But like if somebody's going to come and talk to us about our perspective on life, you know, and like, oh, you don't really understand. You know, and if it's another SF guy, then the level of competition, that competitive nature, like, oh, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to ambush them. I mean, just like the classic things that I've know you've heard before of like, I want to save this guy's life. Because you just want to, like a bunch of pit bulls that have been locked up in a cage and they just get prodded every once in a while and maybe they go and tear something apart and they get thrown, like some raw meat and they're like, oh, this is good. You even know things like, hey, I got to watch out for this guy's, you know, head position. You know, like when people are like, hey, I'm just not being able to put the get the output, the volume that I need to do for work. And so as you're describing this philosophy, it's something that we literally say on every it's a chapter in the book that is what I just said like, oh everything you're saying is like locking in exactly what's like, well, he's been saying, So I don't limit myself while I love reading non-fiction and learning, you know, like I am like the book I'm reading right now. You know, you get guys like you and I appreciate when someone like yourself takes a certain artistic perspective when it comes to combat. Like on my dad's an amazing human, my mom's an amazing human, my sister and my brother, you know, like even to this day, I aspire to be what they are. and I was like, obviously I would have had their own one of the same, and I was like, I just want to, you know, be Chuck Norris essentially. Um, but I had like six or seven of them cuffs together and there was like, there's like 18 or there's 12 of them yet left You know, not like one thousand, not like one hundred, which would have been a lot. My statement, and I put it right on top of that, I would say that not only do you want to stop being scared and do that thing that you don't know if you can do or not, but you know what you got to do is you got to start taking the steps now. So like this isn't just like you, you know, in this misogynistic sexist way, we're all in with this girl. I mean, we're here in California, you know, like the perceived utopian, you know, the Shangri-La of the United States.
