Oh, there you go proper dinner break proper surgery Going back to this I didn't know it at the time, but I was lying unconscious on the floor while I was lying on Conscious on the floor my CLT made to where outside the door of the room trying to get a shot at the enemy two of our Iraqi counterparts Where the only eyes that saw me enter the room in the chaos that ensued they were unable to communicate my location to anyone The volume of fire coming from the room through the door and out of the window is so excessive that there was no way Anyone else was getting into the room the team decided to pull everyone back and call an air strike to neutralize the target And me with it As the team pulled back from the house Connor my other CLT made with shot and wounded by one of the two remaining enemy fighters firing over my head and out the window While I lay on the floor my teammates worked their radio is calling for the status of each other and what was going on in the house I heard nothing As the remaining elements of my assault team departed the house and moved to a safe dropping distance from the target I was lying on my left side with my pistol still in my right hand just like before my arm reached up and aimed at one of the men Standing in front of me and my finger pulled the trigger. But I mean this if you all the research I did on it it happens to a lot of people prominent people educated people And I say in the book, you know, I either saw it happen Because I have some people that like hey you just have the ability to see evil It was a temporary psychotic break which hasn't happened since which I've tried to Like man, I don't think that's happened again With meditation because I think it was the meditation that did it that Popped open different parts of my brain that I never used But I cover my ass in there You know and you can do everything perfectly things go wrong Perfect plan goes to shit in the first 30 seconds right Rewinded a little bit this is what you said It was surreal like something out of a movie time slowed down almost to a stop and everything happened in super slow motion Almost as if I were watching a scene unfold frame by frame Second scene like minutes a slow motion torn a bullets flew at me I could clearly see all the bullets coming at me I had total auditory exclusion there were no sounds I'd never been shot before so I had no idea how it felt in this strange slow motion scene I had a mental conversation with myself hey am I actually getting shot right now? We get the warrior kid podcast We got warrior kids soap From Irish Oaks Ranch dot com you can get soap so that you and everyone you know can Stay clean we got a YouTube channel this where echo puts tons of special effects in two minute videos and then puts no special effects in of three hour video Lot of people a lot of people don't agree with that, but that's what echoes doing in according to him That's the way it should be so whatever I'll also have an album called psychological warfare where I will tell you some little things to do to get through moment to weakness Which we won't got a little moment to weakness a Tacom That's what I'm saying if you need some support attacking you support by fire position press play Listen to some psychological warfare if you need a visual signal for Overcoming in a moment a weakness go to flip side canvas dot com Dakota Meyer I know real force we could take a little bit more if we had birds but A normal force and a half of it had to be a rackies and we don't give them mods and radio so you have to make Corrections for that like we have to drive the vehicles So it'd be like 20 guys but that would include a turp You know half a rocket force Occasionally brought this marine had a dog that never found anything but a pistol holster He did say that dog might have got baked in the car and it gets warm out there But I decomplected the front door they came in they were Reclear the house because I pulled the guy off the front door that I told she'd anybody that came through because they were taken fire from me outside You know when when the neighbors know that you're there Some people like to shoot at the window at you Which was a lesson that we learned early on because Who doesn't like the blow up a door With sometimes you don't have to blow it up sometimes just turn it door knob sometimes that door knob works I mean, I'll show you real slavery that's happening right now Now As you're doing this stuff with other people this is when your starting to realize that you know you should get checked out yourself Am I getting that right like in the timeline like this is when you start going hey man. That's freaking awesome that that we do that in the teams I learned a lot there being an instructor and like you were talking about earlier, you know watching Um 20 different groups come through people do different things in different ways and like man that was really stupid or man I wish I would have thought of that You ended up getting some tattoos and this was cool. You know like that you've got a whole sort of like Excessive conversations floating in the air had to just Yeah, I've done all in the camera here with a zero I'd be just as soon like read off the stuff you tell where to go and we leave I'd be down with that. Let's face it and that's not that's a common thing like because sometimes we can go straight up two hours before we've been Pressure cord because we're you know whatever whatever and when you think about it I'm just realizing this just now like we kind of rolled in where you like kind of all business. I think stay capable Of course you're not gonna well we all have our challenges right like how you guys were saying uh Like people's challenges are more or lesser whatever, but there are We have like that's what you're saying. and it seemed like you had plotted out a whole kind of topic here that we were gonna go into Yeah, you are gonna go right you know I feel it too, but and you know now that you mentioned that you're right Yeah, you know, I think that That uh Just letting people know like somebody thinks oh, I'm gonna go see a therapist and it doesn't work out because that therapist doesn't have with that Perpetent particular person needs It's got to read this bro Because it's a one one page chapter Called the enemy within I fully accepted all the hazards of my chosen occupation being wounded was no big deal to me At no time during or after I was shot that I ever think I was going to die I was provided the best medical care available and was sure that my physical wounds would eventually heal The real battle began when I returned home the war and Iraq was straightforward I was expertly trained and had the unconditional support of a community of like-minded highly motivated professionals Professionals as a seal I'd been institutionalized in a sense I knew the culture the people the rules and the objective After leaving the military and returning home my life became a Confusing frustrating and stressful mess. I think like Say he does that We don't like that plan the Man for you to like just go back into full on team guy mode of okay here's what's going on I'm shot up. there was this All this guy's equipment to include his name his LBE is a little bearing equipment with his magazines and it still had his name on it that his night vision goggles That is pistol That a bunch of these guys stuff and it was from what we figured out Ambushed out in the body Army unit in the body so an army unit in the body got ambushed They captured this guy's equipment and then they put it to use and they put it to use on you man and the green tip Was the only one that penetrated through the plate and Made entry into the soft armor it got about halfway through all the plies on the soft armor You mentioned the green tip like that it's standard You You well, sir, you talk about like I said you talk about some of this trauma and whatnot And here's like here's like here's a little sample of sort of how you start looking at this stuff I would spend the next 18 months training guys Shuffling papers in a administrative duty at my new command It occurred to me that those sledjammers smashing all of my body will bullets hitting me one after another It was in this moment that I said my first real prayer God please get me home to my girls My wife and two young daughters were halfway around the world in that instant I felt them and they felt me I felt like a bullet dodging character in the movie the matrix only it wasn't dodging any of the bullets They were hitting me my rifle shot out of my hands bullets whizzing past my head hammered into the men entering the room behind me even as I continued to penetrate down the left wall Nobody else in my train would be able to make entry as all four of the enemy continued to fire directly into what is known as the fatal funnel The dimly lit doorway in which I was standing The enemy bullets triggered my rage and drove me to act it was then that my body became Became my mind and took over I suppose that's what habit is when somebody when the body over rides the mind and acts without specific Instructions from the brain my right hand instinctively reached down from my secondary weapon epistol My hand was on autopilot as unhooked the rubber strap I'd fastening to keep my pistol secure and with a fluid push Food forward push and pull very same motion. but at the time there's just you know It's a chemical about I mean It's be more people are coming aware of it now that the gut brain access I mean The gut is probably a smarter brain than the one in our skull It can't operate properly unless unless you put proper nutrients and And vitamins and this doctor is also really big into the EMF electromagnetic fields, you know, you know how we're affected. I watched some YouTube videos to figure out what a Kundalini awakening look like and it's like a yoga Like you just we it says a weird like spiritual trip I guess It's awesome, but you know from my perspective there's there's no more powerful tribute than you can make then Then doing what you're doing right now, you know trying to help other people out Trying to live a good life take carry family and and really Sharing all the things that you've been through and how you made it through them with other people and I think there's nothing better that you could do to truly on reclarks His sacrifice so it's a year long work up you know broken up into three into three parts You know, pro-to-have everybody going to schools um and ULT just doing all the standard T-C-C-South Air did you guys know that you were going to Iraq when you hadn't formed up? You know where they were from so they can hang out with the family and so you're you're when you're in that job You're an advocate for all these wounded guys correct non medical case manager Non medical case manager going okay, and this guys this kid will tell you hey, you know I'm having problems with my ex girlfriend and we got to need to help with that I mean yeah, some people might think he's got some sway political views right now, but You know, I watched him take care of people and that's kind of how I judge people Yeah, you got to definitely adjust your standards in a real big way Yeah, but it's kind of cool because I'm thinking about you know your last Your previous deployment where you were kind of gathering a lot of intel and stuff like that Oh, yeah for sure when I got there When I got to team two, you know, I was hoping that I would get to be able to do that, but it was already That program was it was no longer like the seal team two was that it's all different. But there's a time limit for how long you can do this job and you maxed it out my Boss and good friend to just give me the hope I needed to climb out of the very deep hole I'd found myself in and that Instant I could not have answered my phone for anyone other than Scott Scott had seen it all before He knew that I was surrounded by wounded sick and injured people all day Scott also knew that many of the people who I'd been meeting with every day for years including patients their family members Veteran service members and hospital staff were struggling with depression It's like an alcohol attending a bar you can only hold out for so long if you're around Depressed people all the time you become depressed too So my joints Could take a beating if I wasn't on that supplementation this one of the things I was thinking about as I'm explaining it to her like I could pull it off Just need to up your joint warfare Just I might have to you know just to first sit, you know for safety sake as it was Nonetheless, yeah, so take the joint warfare just in case somebody else you do a back flip for sure Talk whatever should not inside the pool or other things. I am still seeking a continuum of care I'm recently looking at a program called Sabah warrior which hand-fold guys have gone to The last three years of my life probably be a lot better book This stuff that I've been dealing with is last three years and the fact that I'm able to manage it is is pretty incredible to me, but I don't know I think some people think Yeah, it's like a Um it'd be a disservice to call it a health drink Even though it essentially is a health drink You know what I'm starting to feel over here is that when we do a podcast like this where you don't say much during that podcast portion Maybe that sort of build some pent-up conversation where where you want to converse with you about stuff And then you just got to know when you know what you don't let the people that are more experienced, you know, take those reins. and They took an X ray of it and came back in X ray of tech was like hey, you know, there's a bullet in your head That's how I found this bullet But the way the hip is you know that that arch right there Yeah, I actually never did cold weather training I hate it I mean, I was in some cold spots, but I never you know, I got snowed on plenty I froze plenty of times out in the sleet and snow, but I never I never did the cold weather the actual cold weather training There's team two guys the old team two guys you still love that stuff. Well, I want to talk about what I call false anxiety first just bad health eating terrible dehydration drinkin too much Your physiology when you're in that kind and that state of health feels like anxiety the increased heart rate The sweaty palms the whole physiology it goes along with anxiety because of bad health It's your physiology reacting to what you people are dumping in their bodies my particular issue and What I think health care should be is an individual evaluation of each person To adjust their medical care for for that because I watch for years people take medication for for migraine and then migraine doesn't go away, but they get another symptoms Just in the front of our podcast and I'm like echo, you know We'll just kind of burn through people kind of know what's up I should get these tests well The only reason I did these tests was because I was having issues and People around me like you're gonna go go get help go talk to somebody and I refuse to And the reason why I went with this doctor was because it was a leasonvasive and I'll have to do is talk to him on Skype He wasn't even in the same state and To an honest life I kind of half-assed it and it worked I've seen other people go through this to include people my own family Yeah, there's something real cool about archery that That it has a lot of similarities, you know to the old job, you know, I like shooting a bow better I say revolution rather than evolution as a result of my experience I have tossed out and or abandoned in every bias relationship belief and dogma that has blocked myself awareness and joy You said and again, I'm reading this stuff because I know that there's People and people talk to me all the time about what they're going through and You know what you say here. I want to improve and another thing with that to it takes you while to get to a bad state You know that one week program's not going to do it a continuum of care and that's working out good diet You know taking care of the things that that lower the stress hormones It's it's not just one thing. and I like a bunch of assholes I you know a lot of people just Don't know that if if you could get punched in the face for being as rude as you are you wouldn't do it Yeah, kind of liking you know, I grew to you know, What was her name that was up there for like longer than anybody was in the seal teams. we use call he was gonna come on the podcast and and and like I was lined it up with you know one of our mutual friends and and we're just you know just trying to find the date and I remember them walking down the line and being like, You can hear me like, I feel like this is pretty good. And then on top of that Teaching medical classes to the military units that there the you know second fourth Iraqi army brigade and Teaching tactics and how to patrol and trying to work with the mid teams It's you know When you run a target for your regular job it's kind of hard to come and be a mid team and in full use of proper Yola and run a military unit especially when I don't speak English Because their standard of work is not what No, it is not But I did get shot in the right places like I know guys it got shot in a femur. Yeah, I went back to work inside of five months about four and a five months and I was in that course that we talked about earlier that Communications course My physical physical medical my physical therapy team became an important part of my recovery in life My team was made up of doctors nurses physical therapist chiropractic inclinations who specialize in all type of care Most importantly this group understood seal culture seals tend toward the extreme We think if one repetition is good then 500 must be great I was blinded by my own bias and it wasn't the first time or the last one day long into my recovery I can find it to my nurse that I may have been experiencing symptoms related to PTSD post traumatic stress disorder I had been sitting in my truck listening to a radio talk show when the when the expert being interviewed began Describing the common symptoms of PTSD the voice spoken a calm matter of fact tone talking about the Autonomic nervous system and how sleeplessness constant irrational fears And hyper vigilance are often normal and predictable responses to trauma. Okay, you know in maturity levels So after while it gets repetitive so when I see you, you know once a week I'm like hey man, let's do this talk. I like shooting a bow better the main reason is because it's quiet It's like there's no like little shock You know, like a guy that they didn't like or whatever had a bad attitude or they thought it was a punk. It does help But I was introduced at this place to you know, shooting with a recurve You know walk in those paths that made with rocks like that Indians used to do So they teach a bunch of mindfulness practices and they were teaching transcendental meditation You um These energy drinks the RTD cans you kind of and I kind of forget this from time to time Two, I'm like okay, I need energy drink, but it's not just the energy drink you get the discipline and you don't get like for real chemicals Let's just say close a parallel if you were actually a parallel Some more like a like a Like a And And if you are hanging out with a bunch of depressed people or people That are like minded that that are negative you're gonna catch it I mean we used to kill that stuff in the sealed teams there's always want that one guy that bitch didn't complain about everything Well, hey, let's beat it up, but hey, let's you know bear with me if you will So yes Discipline can powder all that good for your brain good for your body keep it keeping keep yourself on the path and capable by the way Mulk extra protein in the form of a dessert eating dessert like what ice cream or Snickers bars for dessert. That's what we're talking about Bro, you know how like okay, I see then what I do is I screw up isn't that I bring it up I should just keep my mouth shut be like up backflips cool. The chance factor was insane once fired a bullet can be unpredictable the internal milling of a gun's barrel causes bullets to Spin and flight some bullets will begin to tumble through the air at low speeds while others are designed to tumble in cartwheel after hitting a target Which can cause some brutal damage It's likely that we were all hit by the same type of bullets at nearly the same time shot from the same gun But the damage to each of us was significantly different a balance of my room clearing train five or six other guys hadn't been able to get in the room because of all the volume of fire I moved from my knees and stood to my feet I felt like there were 200 pounds on my back. Was it like, did you do like 750 a day or something like that? Oh, okay, so he was good to go One of the newly arrived First night the still in the first night One of the newly arrived seals from team 10 was outside under the carport looking into the rooms only window when he saw my bullets enter the enemies head He watched as the enemy fell the ensuing grenade blast shattered the window sprang shards of glass into my teammates face This was his first mission on Iraq a new way to stop great-day and wait and start a new job Grenade blast knocked me unconscious when I woke a few minutes later I was fully lucid and lying on my left side looking across the room at two men both were firing their weapons over my head out the window directly above me The grenade blast had twisted my helmet rendering my night vision goggles unusable The light from their muzzle flashes and the dim glow of the gas lamp and the foyer were enough to clearly illuminate the men standing no more than 10 feet away from me I heard no sounds it was totally silent. Let's go hit it, you know That's you know to get that to get a bunch of DA's down like that. So it is it is inspiring to see people that we assume have a worse deal Which is a hard thing for people to get across to like I don't have the right to feel this way because that guys worse for that girls worse Which is not true. Yeah, the vehicle antenna for the satellite We figured it well one of our new guys put it on on the radio with a switch So this My sees running right and look like Inspector Gadget, you know with helicopter But what I like, yeah, it's got like those little nubs on the end of the world.

I'm like okay, all right, all right, and then finally the last thing he did was this backflip Sort of the finale of the video like saying thanks for watching and he does a backflip Yeah, what a doubt overload Uh Going back to the book 15 minute minutes after I'd called the team to let them know I'd been shot the MetaVac landed I had to say that because that's freaking awesome Jack asked if I need any help as we walk together to the bird about 150 yards and all I felt heavy and slow as we walked together Over the freshly plowed field I put my left arm over his shoulder to steady myself as I moved Jack instinctively reached up and grab my hand Which almost ripped off my dangling thumb jack I'm like, I'm like blonde hair and you know, blue eyes. I'd use one like this to kill before I was numb and sad confused and tired I had cried alone so many times My downward spiral had come to its final resting place at the bottom was hopelessness The built-up stress the lingering effects of trauma my psychological deficits all Caluded to create a condition of hopelessness My mind worked trying to come up with an explanation to justify my final act to my two beautiful daughters years ago In that room at that compound the thought of not being able to see their faces again terrified me Images flashed in my mind holding my daughters little hand in her own as we sat together The way the girls would wrap their arms around my neck and hug me their soft little voices called out so I'd have to like prove it, you know and there was like a rope in it too And back in the day, like when when you and I first got to the team, I don't know one wanted to be in training cell. There's only four seats and well five and you got the gunner, but the way we work Six people in a vehicle you're only getting Four people that are actually gonna work maybe three inside yeah, so I Have worked with other units where they leave Everybody gets out of the vehicle on the way the counter stays.
