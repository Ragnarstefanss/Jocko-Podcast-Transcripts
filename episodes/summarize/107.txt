I mean these I'm I just realize I was almost reading those as if like Hey, we already know these things it's like these are things that we know Not that not that they're not important and obviously how more new and before I did He learned them in the occupation of Japan Here he talks about some of that he worked for The officer under whom I served for the longest period in Japan was major man's field He was always cool never raised his voice Very perceptive took no wooden nickels and was a natural leader He told me that what he wanted to be done and let me run with the ball He trusted me and I went and extra two to three miles to make sure I would never let him down Never do a shabby job or never lose his trust That right there is this like you could just give that to people and say hey think about this man If you're gonna be in a leadership position think about this Always cool never raise your voice give people what you want to do and let them know with the ball Like that's just basic stuff, but it's so important What's the wooden nickel wooden nickel? but you don't want them to get it by cutting it down other units that are within your team Fourth and so vital a man must have confidence in trusting his leaders He must know and utterly believe his leaders are competent professionals who know What they are doing and are not careless or casual in their outlook toward their responsibilities For a subordinate to be confident in his leader the subordinate must know the leaders are aware of and Appreciates what the subordinate must face and the life he must lead in performing his job The leader must make every effort to get inside the heads of his men and see their problems and the world from their viewpoint You got to get the perspective of your people You got to understand what they're going through You know he talked about and we were soldiers once or young that in the in the civil war the the officers it was like bad if you can ride your horse all the time Because you didn't understand the guys that were marching with their going through it and Vietnam some guys were riding the helicopter all the Some commanders would stay over the battlefield it 2000 feet out of a small arms range where safe up here nothing can happen I'm kind of thinking off feels so good to not to not eat right now because yeah in two days I'm gonna eat Yeah, it's the same we have feel strangely not strangely, but same way I feel when I go in vacation or I'm like if I didn't Do a lot of work for the you know the past months or whatever like let's say work is like kind of Chris we'll say So I just went 24 hours You know what I've noticed this time and like I said it's only been 30-60 hours or no, but what I've noticed this time is the actual I felt good about exercising discipline like I felt good about like I'm not eating that because Maybe it's because because I Just I've been thinking myself like like you didn't like test me you know how like If I shoot all that like at the master I'm kind of shooting all day for 430 I'm shooting everyone he's talking about taking pictures and I'm like where are you shooting? And when you say everyone's while you got a boss it out like like like Like your second alert emergency situation We look I'm telling you you could just put your shoes on we got to go like that because I said Yeah, it's watching that and it made sense You know you see everyone that's part of the the factory they kind of give their input in the video a little bit and it made sense so like You know like there's a lot of geese that are made you know kind of thing but if it's made by jujitsu people they're gonna know like when you put on a gui Jacket they're gonna know the difference between a gui that's that whoever designed it had this in my there When you put your hands up What's that gui gonna do you know if you're just and If he told me to do something I know he's got a good reason why because if he had time to tell me why He would tell me hey can you put your home view over there because we're gonna about to you know move guys out in this book whatever Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, I I don't need to hear all that unless unless I've got my home be there for reason and now he's saying to me like hey move your home view Hey, hold up. I mean A valid point we don't now the the counter to that is look you don't know you're gonna get ambushed if you get it if you know You're gonna get ambushed like that against you know 15 hundred soldiers the enemy soldiers then you would make this different decision So if we you know if I said to do something he'd do it and Know that I had a good reason for if he told me to do something I would do it because I know he had a good reason for and then later on He'd say yeah, you know, I need you to do that move that home because we had we you were blocking the field of fire from inside this building I know we don't talk about seal training a lot but when you go through hell week Which is like when you stay awake for five days One of the things that I thought about when I was going through hell week was like oh, it's gonna feel so good to sleep Yeah, that's like um Like good doesn't mean like hey, this is the best podcast ever good right? or You know when you do jujitsu, let's face it like if you do karate Your body goes through a certain thing right while you're doing karate and whatever capacity If you do jujitsu your body is gonna go through a certain thing and more appropriately your gui is gonna go through a certain Exterior you can't use a karate gui for those you but oh, so you're like one of the guys who like you know certain people they have their like Yeah, and that seems like jjitsu is one of those things like life is one of those things where This kind of supplement makes 100% sense because it is physical and mental and not just Like everything's mental. And I had to be very careful I'd check myself sometimes because you want to it's the same thing Just like you just like you want I want to tell my subordinates like shut up and put that element of training back He's gonna be doing brass pickup or whatever he's gonna be doing something cleaning the military vehicles as always You know one of the best what wax the six by That's that they you can handle it there you don't need to tell The patoon commander the patoon the task unit commander now it could be different the guy gets in trouble It now he gets arrested because now we're gonna hear about it because they're gonna find out the guys military But I like hey here's what's going on if we take these number of guys in the field with this many Iraqis We're not gonna have all the people that we should have in the field to be safe You know you're talking about leaving behind a corpsman you're talking about leaving behind a A radio man you're talking about leaving behind a Close-air support fires guy those are guys. and you know it happens in the military too where you don't always have time You know if you're not if you're in a combat situation, you know you can't say a Hey, take that building over there and the reason why I want you to do this because bubble you know you don't have time to do that I'll work out in 19 hours a day and the other five I'll be doing jiu-jitsu Or whatever Next a good leader studies the culture of any location where he's planning to go and ensures his subordinates are properly educated on the same Here's a good one when in charge take charge But treat your subordinates with respect to dignity and common courtesy Here's another one a workers performance Often reflects the attitude of his leadership If you want something done ask nicely if a subordinate forgets to perform a task don't take it personally Just remind them nicely in any organization everyone has a to-do list while juggling these tasks Some things will never leave fall through the cracks when this happens don't assume that this subordinates Laze your stupid simply re-engage them on the task and if necessary emphasize why it's a priority If the subordinate performs a task and the outcome is not what you expected don't attack their intelligence or character Playfully explain the deficiencies and offer an idea for solution subordinates quickly lose respect for a leader who is all problem and no solution Speaking of problems wherever possible solve problems at the lowest level when leaders are confronted with disciplinary problems Be it willful disobedience negligence or honest mistakes they must resolve these problems at the lowest level before raising the the issue to higher echelons If the problem can be fixed and Remedy instituted at lower levels it will benefit your relationship with your subordinates improve the health of the organization And not divert higher level resources away from their priorities solve things at the lowest level. You obviously we know him, but He'd be like jacosol such a badass who like the way he talks to the this appears is like it's so gangster Okay, so that's that is what I think was kind of like a Given what I felt anyway and keep the same private right meaning like if you have an official complaint like I'll say we need to change this. It's never that that that that that school-field's definition He said you cannot fail to inspire a hatred Treat sure thing treat people this you know that that you know what that is I think that is psychologically right human beings we want to be free we want to have we want to determine our our path So you don't want your people just trained to do their job You want them to be able to step up and do the next job above them in the chain of command in addition to creating Confidence through individual expertise his superiors facilitated development through trust and how they treat them This is imperative every person's dignity must always be respected I feel that if anyone under me fails the fault is at least half mind A man should never be caused to think poorly of himself and this requires a subtle Unsensitive touch by the leader especially when taking disciplinary action So the first thing you want us to have is self-confidence, right, and you develop it by how you treat them Second but non-priority word in non-priority order is the necessity for each to have complete confidence in his personal weapon as Well as any other weapon he might have to handle to include using radios and the knowing procedure And knowing the procedures for requesting and controlling mortar and artillery fires Developing this takes leader controlled leader supervised training. so like look you type you know when you tie your pants or something like this How your pants are tied Matters when you do jujitsu true just like how you belt it when you're belt But you cannot coordinate your plan with the enemy Therefore you have to think through all the what ifs The enemy does this what happens if the enemy does that what happens it's time well spent We always say the enemy gets a vote not what he said Yeah, you can you can court you can make your plans, but your plans aren't coordinated with what the enemy's gonna do there The enemy's gonna do what the enemy's gonna do Soldiers in battle fight kill and die and die primarily for each other Don't complain to your boss He wants solutions not just problems Right, That's what you got to remember and When you do occasionally say that like when I would say to my guys to do something They do like they do it because they Because it was so seldom that I would utilize like some sort of the okay do this now very rarely Exercise that That power over the guys and it would probably I mean, I'm just assuming now It's not just like I was like manipulating it's like no you're the radio man If we need help you're the only person that's gonna get us out. yeah, like what just happened I kind of feel obviously I feel like I'm working on it like tank I could be sleeping None of the last But I, you know how like some people, I don't know if you're like this. That's not a complaint No, that's an explanation of what's going on and a commander's intent about how much Ammonition we're going to use yeah, the conserving ammunition yeah check Back to the book we're getting into Vietnam shortly after 9 a.m. on June 29, 1964 I was handed the colors of the second battalion 23rd infantry accepting the colors Means the commander is now Responsible for all his command does or fails to do Yeah, once you're in charge you're responsible for everything Now If you remember in we were soldiers once and young There was the lost platoon which was led by Henry T. Haric Lieutenant Henry T. Haric and this guy was known to be aggressive Aggressive to the point of being reckless, right overly aggressive And His sergeant major and this is this is from the book Here sergeant major plumbly told him Colonel if you put Lieutenant Haric in there He will get all of them killed his senior enlisted man His sergeant major told him hey don't put this guy in charge He put him in charge anyways and you know, hey shut up That's a dumb idea, but you can't do that and all you're gonna do then is what you're gonna do is you're gonna make them matter You the same thing that I just talked about going down the chain of cranks goes up the chain of command too so if If I treat you if you're my boss and I treat you with disrespect I don't need it like I don't In the morning I'm ready like I wake up and and I'm Like ready to rock and all I don't I'm gonna get in there. Yeah, but that's still a little like, and what I interpreted that or read into it is that, dang, like, it didn't take you much time to start messing with me like that. This is a hundred percent true women alcohol Fieroms control not so much money and vehicles for sure guys crashing cars guys DUIs guys crashing motorcycle guys getting trouble with girls Drinking is is encompassed in all those Knowing this a leader can perform a lot of preventative maintenance As an isolated but not so example pay problems often arise for separated families living on limited income Many of these can be eliminated in advance by real leadership In summary My views are take care of the troops develop four way confidence and be professional This ensures we can carry out our first duty accomplishment of the mission Finally concerning professionalism I believe even now the clock is bringing us closer to some few seconds minutes or hours in the future When the professionalism we will have or will not have We'll make a life or death difference for the men placed under our leadership And whose families can only trust hope and pray That we know our business And again there's more in that book hey we're not gonna show any fear We're not gonna show any possibility of ever losing you know, I don't think he's talking about that I think he's talking about Even though you might be thinking that and even know you might give the indication But that's what it was predicated on and so that's the whole thing he didn't want to Put it this way if he told if he was if you tell the secret He would like I don't know ruin some relationship and if he didn't it was like they'd be fine He must ensure that these objectives are clearly understood by his subordinate leaders Lesson learned Here's a Speaking of family life there are at least five activities that must be kept in balance through proper time management these five activities are the job Physical fitness personal time alone recreation and social relationships Also if they apply to others religion and family If any of these get out of balance then life gets out of balance For my own personal experience and observation of others Being a workaholic is the most common area of imbalance and again that's what I saw a lot with with the guys I used to work with They're workaholics and not with that you know you meet business guys all the time You're not you're not there's so many business guys that are workaholics Business men business women that are out there they're grinding they love it and that works real good for jjitsu too because jjitsu is one of those things Let's say come to an up-bench press you know people ask me all the time like good You take a pre workout in the morning because I get up early morning and I work out I don't know whatever either way When you wake up sometimes you're not gonna feel like it sometimes you're gonna want to hit this news boom put in one of these tracks Yeah, I mean if that's true, you know like where like the carrying a notebook around now the nowadays Who people would notice in your phone do you put notes in your phone? I mean I don't recommend Basically, but As far as you're a criteria for the word good in this specific case Good good good review You know entertaining I should tell entertaining there's entertaining there it is same with same with on Amazon Yes, there's some entertaining Reviews I've read some of those I'll read some more of those because they're good people put time and effort into those and then yeah, so you know, like how, you know, you're gut feeling kind of thing. Yeah, that keeps going Be careful that one Balance After Vietnam he went and took over a base where they were running basic training and here's what he said about basic training The goal was for every man leaving basic combat training to be in the best physical shape of his life And to know it to stretch his mind and his muscles and to assist him in thereby gaining more pride in himself More self confidence and above all more self discipline A man who has more self discipline has more confidence in his ability to do the job I got asked a while back me. Yeah, you know because cuz you know because to my guys I might be like hey guys, we're not doing that. Oh, yeah for sure like peanut butter like there would have been fasting the biggest thing I think the biggest thing somebody's asking me about it the other day
