00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.08
This is Jockel Podcasts number 116 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,

2
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:20.000
echo. Good evening. So this then was the culmination. To die. Die in the stinking mud.

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.72
Twice before I'd crossed this no man's land darting from shell hole to shell hole. I'm

4
00:00:28.72 --> 00:00:41.92
no hero. I was numb with fear. But this time a barrage was on. I lay there at the wasteland's edge

5
00:00:41.92 --> 00:00:54.32
thinking. Was there any way to the right, late crack, shot snipers to the left in the brush,

6
00:00:54.32 --> 00:01:07.52
machine guns, hungry, waiting, and fair in the front great bursting mud clouds playing toss

7
00:01:08.40 --> 00:01:16.72
with bodies. Get through once more, son. The Colonel had said, communications down,

8
00:01:16.72 --> 00:01:32.40
our guns firing short killing our boys. Yes, it must be done. But how? Wait. The barrage sweeping across

9
00:01:32.40 --> 00:01:39.12
the field and back a deadly windshield wiper where I'd to follow it down and when I returned,

10
00:01:39.12 --> 00:01:51.60
dig in. I might. Now drunk with fighting fear. I chased the mud cloud down the field,

11
00:01:51.60 --> 00:01:58.80
kicking dead bodies, twisting like a ghost. And I laughed and I yelled you bastards, you can't get me.

12
00:01:58.80 --> 00:02:11.92
The are trenches ahead, almost there. Back came hells when she'll wiper, vomiting death,

13
00:02:11.92 --> 00:02:29.60
and I dug in, dug in with all I had. Mom, dear God help me. On it came, 40 feet, 20 feet,

14
00:02:29.60 --> 00:02:52.16
God, my head torn from my body. Is this what being dead is like peace, quiet,

15
00:02:52.16 --> 00:03:05.12
clean white sheets. My head must still be here. It hurts me. These must be my fingers. I can move them

16
00:03:07.52 --> 00:03:20.000
and now a voice. My boy, for you, the war is over. You hear that, mom?

17
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:42.48
I'm still alive. I did not die. I'm coming home. And that is a poem that was written by a

18
00:03:42.48 --> 00:03:55.44
man by the name of Ralph Mone of East Machiaus, Maine, who left his job as a civil engineer in

19
00:03:55.44 --> 00:04:04.40
waterville, Maine to enlist in the army in 1917. And he was wounded badly on that day, but he did live.

20
00:04:04.40 --> 00:04:13.60
And he was decorated for his actions on that day in the citation for his award reads,

21
00:04:13.60 --> 00:04:20.32
the president of the United States of America authorized by active Congress, 9 July 1918,

22
00:04:20.32 --> 00:04:27.12
takes pleasure in presenting the distinguished service cross to mechanic Ralph T. Mone,

23
00:04:27.12 --> 00:04:32.72
United States Army for extraordinary heroism in action while serving with company K.

24
00:04:32.72 --> 00:04:40.16
103rd Infantry Regiment, 26 Division American Expeditionary Force,

25
00:04:40.16 --> 00:04:50.40
near Raeville, France, 26 September 1918. Mechanic Mone, who is detailed as a runner,

26
00:04:50.40 --> 00:04:55.76
made several trips carrying important messages across terrain swept by constant fire from

27
00:04:55.76 --> 00:05:04.08
machine guns, snipers, trench mortars, and artillery. His disregard for personal safety and

28
00:05:04.08 --> 00:05:11.12
devotion to duty in the prompt delivery of messages contributed greatly to the success of the action.

29
00:05:15.52 --> 00:05:22.40
And Ralph Mone, according to his family, never spoke of the war to his children or his grandchildren.

30
00:05:22.40 --> 00:05:32.80
But he did live with it every day. And tonight I am honored to have a guest

31
00:05:34.32 --> 00:05:43.92
back on the podcast, who is also wounded in war, but who has not let that stop him in any way.

32
00:05:45.92 --> 00:05:51.92
From driving on with his mission and his life and doing more than most people could ever

33
00:05:51.92 --> 00:06:05.04
even imagine. Mr. Rob Jones, a Marine, a wounded warrior, and an inspiration to anyone that's

34
00:06:05.04 --> 00:06:13.36
lucky enough to come into contact with him. Rob Jones, welcome back to the show.

35
00:06:13.36 --> 00:06:21.36
Hey, you know what? It's an honor to be just a single-time guest on what I consider to be the best

36
00:06:21.36 --> 00:06:27.04
podcast on the airways. But to be a two-time guest is purely rarefire air. I'm just

37
00:06:27.76 --> 00:06:32.72
I appreciate you guys deeming me worthy of a second visit. So, as you compare to

38
00:06:33.84 --> 00:06:39.84
that gentleman is even greater on or so. Yeah, you know, I read that a while back and it was one of

39
00:06:39.84 --> 00:06:43.84
those things as I was reading it. I was thinking about you, I was thinking about, you know,

40
00:06:43.84 --> 00:06:50.24
I was thinking about Jodi, thinking about Travis, thinking about you guys that were wounded bad

41
00:06:50.24 --> 00:06:55.84
and and I've heard that before in another is another book I read about World War One,

42
00:06:55.84 --> 00:07:01.04
where guys they wake up, they think they're in heaven because they see white sheets and they see

43
00:07:01.04 --> 00:07:03.84
you know, there's a nurse there that's talking to icy to him and they think they're dead,

44
00:07:03.84 --> 00:07:08.40
they think they're in heaven. And that reminded me, you know, when I read that, I was thinking

45
00:07:08.40 --> 00:07:14.08
about you and and haven't we waking up, you know, in a hospital somewhere and I know you actually woke

46
00:07:14.08 --> 00:07:18.64
up, you're not supposed to wake up in Germany, but you did. No, you're not supposed to, but

47
00:07:19.84 --> 00:07:23.84
you have for whatever reason, I woke up. I think I need to drink a water. You know,

48
00:07:25.04 --> 00:07:29.76
need to hydrate. Yeah, I'm not sure why I woke up. I don't remember much, but and the

49
00:07:29.76 --> 00:07:34.64
I didn't definitely didn't see anybody you could mistake for an angel or an adult squalidor.

50
00:07:34.64 --> 00:07:40.72
Yeah, well for anyone that's listening that hasn't listened to the first time Robo's on

51
00:07:41.52 --> 00:07:48.72
go back and listen to episode 92 and that's where we go through what Robo went through,

52
00:07:48.72 --> 00:07:54.08
how is raised, you know, growing up, joined the Marine Corps, deployment to Iraq, deployment to Afghanistan

53
00:07:54.08 --> 00:08:02.24
and that's where Robo's wounded, hit an ID and ended up losing both legs above the knee, but

54
00:08:02.24 --> 00:08:10.80
like I said, that didn't stop Rob and he went from that and in the podcast, we jumped really

55
00:08:10.80 --> 00:08:17.04
quickly through sort of your healing process and we jumped right into the fact that you were

56
00:08:17.44 --> 00:08:25.60
went out did the the Paralympics as a roar and we jumped into the fact that you rode a bicycle

57
00:08:25.60 --> 00:08:33.52
across America, which is yeah across America during the polar vortex, by the way, yeah that's

58
00:08:33.52 --> 00:08:38.64
all that stuff is covered in 92, but I was actually going back and I was listening to 92 and I realized

59
00:08:38.64 --> 00:08:45.84
that you know, maybe it's just your attitude that might have made me kind of do this in the conversation,

60
00:08:45.84 --> 00:08:50.24
your attitude is like, yeah, I lost both my legs and then I was just competing in the Paralympics.

61
00:08:50.24 --> 00:08:56.48
You know, you made it sound like it's like it was easy, that's the way it kind of came across

62
00:08:56.48 --> 00:09:03.04
in the podcast and what I wanted to do today was kind of at least go back and talk a little with

63
00:09:03.04 --> 00:09:10.48
a little bit more detail about that process of going because it's a long process, right?

64
00:09:10.48 --> 00:09:16.16
You're in a half, yeah, for me anyway. Yeah, a year and a half of from letting the wounds heal

65
00:09:16.16 --> 00:09:22.40
all the way through, you know, where now you're competing in the Paralympics and you're getting

66
00:09:22.40 --> 00:09:30.40
around in your mobile and all that. So you get back, how long does it take for your wounds?

67
00:09:30.40 --> 00:09:34.56
Could you can't do anything until your wounds are healed up, right? No, I mean, well, you can do some

68
00:09:34.56 --> 00:09:41.76
stuff. You can't do anything as far as prosthetics are concerned. So in the beginning, you know,

69
00:09:41.76 --> 00:09:45.36
the physical therapist would come in and they just basically just have me move my stumps around

70
00:09:45.36 --> 00:09:49.52
and that would be like, you know, lift your right stump 10 times, lift your left one,

71
00:09:49.52 --> 00:09:54.64
move it out and back and then that would be it for the day. Or, you know, I could do, you know,

72
00:09:54.64 --> 00:09:59.36
my arm store work. So I would do little pull-ups on my little trapeze bar that I had attached to the

73
00:09:59.36 --> 00:10:05.76
the bed. But yeah, as you know, surgeries every other day, they just come in and take me over and

74
00:10:05.76 --> 00:10:10.24
they would just be this clean in the wound out and he did tissue or anything that was still

75
00:10:10.24 --> 00:10:14.16
left and there they cleaned that out. But I had these wound back machines on that were just

76
00:10:14.16 --> 00:10:20.80
constantly sucking the fluids out of the wounds because they were they were open for the first month.

77
00:10:22.16 --> 00:10:28.08
And yeah, so they were just like, kind of sucking that stuff out and it's just a, you know,

78
00:10:28.08 --> 00:10:34.24
waiting game at that point. I mean, you can do some stuff. Like, I figured out how to,

79
00:10:34.24 --> 00:10:38.72
it's slowly got to kind of three figured out how to move my body around and move my legs around

80
00:10:38.72 --> 00:10:45.44
to get comfortable and where you getting like the fan of pains. Yeah, I didn't get it as bad as

81
00:10:45.44 --> 00:10:52.08
Travis had it. I never had to do a, uh, what was it? A ketamine coma in order to, uh, I had it

82
00:10:52.08 --> 00:10:58.64
some, um, and they gave me this stuff called Lyrica, which is like a fiber myology of medication.

83
00:10:59.52 --> 00:11:05.68
And I got it and I never really had it all that bad. It's like, it's pretty much at the same level.

84
00:11:05.68 --> 00:11:12.32
It is, is is now where every, maybe twice a day, my toe will kind of like hurt pretty bad for

85
00:11:12.32 --> 00:11:16.80
four, five seconds and that's it. But there's some people that have it a lot worse. So I kind of

86
00:11:16.80 --> 00:11:22.96
lucked out with that. But yeah, so first month is kind of learning how to get into the wheelchair,

87
00:11:24.88 --> 00:11:30.08
you know, at first I wouldn't, I couldn't, I was so sore. I couldn't really move very much. And so

88
00:11:31.20 --> 00:11:34.72
I had to have a nurse and whoever was in their visiting me if I want to get my wheelchair, I'd be

89
00:11:34.72 --> 00:11:40.72
sitting on this little pad. And I'd say, all right, I want to go for a roll. And then so they would,

90
00:11:40.72 --> 00:11:43.92
the nurse would be on one side and the other person would be on the side and they kind of like

91
00:11:44.88 --> 00:11:49.36
scoot me onto the wheelchair. And then we'd have to take the wound back machines and hook them onto

92
00:11:49.36 --> 00:11:54.88
the wheelchair and take my catheter, which I was very, very protective of that catheter.

93
00:11:56.88 --> 00:12:03.60
Uh, hang that on there. And then, uh, the IV pole would have to come with me. And so then I would just

94
00:12:03.60 --> 00:12:09.92
kind of roll myself around the world a couple times with, you know, my dad or my mom or somebody

95
00:12:09.92 --> 00:12:15.12
pushing the IV pole. And yeah, I just do that a couple times. Then I'd go see my buddy Daniel,

96
00:12:15.12 --> 00:12:19.52
because he couldn't get out of bed yet. So I go and see, visit him for a little bit and I go back to

97
00:12:19.52 --> 00:12:24.96
my room and that'd be pretty much my exercise for the day. And then have like six milkshakes.

98
00:12:27.20 --> 00:12:30.80
This, uh, eaten as much as I possibly could to help with the healing process.

99
00:12:30.80 --> 00:12:39.68
You know, where did you go through the whole woe is me? Why did this happen to me?

100
00:12:41.04 --> 00:12:45.44
Did you go through that at all? And I mean, I know I've listened to some of your stuff and

101
00:12:45.44 --> 00:12:51.04
reading some of your stuff, you know, you talk about the fact that you knew you had to just move

102
00:12:51.04 --> 00:12:58.000
to like an acceptance phase immediately. Is that, is that what you did? I mean, how did you get

103
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.04
look, man, people hit all kinds of freaking roadblocks in life and, and very few of them are as heavy

104
00:13:05.04 --> 00:13:10.64
of, and big of a roadblock as you hit and you seem to power through that thing like,

105
00:13:11.60 --> 00:13:20.80
miraculously. You know, I don't, I never, I never entered into an extended period that could be described as like,

106
00:13:20.80 --> 00:13:27.68
uh, depression or woe is me, you know, feeling sorry for myself. It would come in very short waves,

107
00:13:29.76 --> 00:13:33.44
where, you know, I'd be sitting around. I would struggle with something maybe.

108
00:13:34.40 --> 00:13:37.76
And then after I figured it out, I might sit there for a couple of minutes, be like, man.

109
00:13:39.84 --> 00:13:43.68
But that'd be about it. And then would be go away after you know, minute or two. It'd be kind of like,

110
00:13:43.68 --> 00:13:52.24
uh, I'd almost kind of like if you're, if you're talking to a girl in a bar and you like your voice

111
00:13:52.24 --> 00:13:56.80
cracked, you just totally blow it and you look like an idiot and then you go back to the

112
00:13:56.80 --> 00:14:03.20
team and like, man, sure. Like that. It was, it was almost kind of like that. Or just like, man, how did I

113
00:14:03.84 --> 00:14:10.72
have I missed that IED, you know, man, the sucks. But, and I, you know, I didn't really think about it

114
00:14:10.72 --> 00:14:14.32
probably this way at the time. I couldn't articulate it at the time like this, but it's like,

115
00:14:16.88 --> 00:14:22.000
that whether or not, you know, I deserved, I, you know, I, you know, I, I could acknowledge, I didn't

116
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.84
deserve it. I didn't deserve to be a double-impitee. I didn't, uh, it wasn't, you know, fair. There's a lot

117
00:14:27.84 --> 00:14:31.52
of other guys that were running around in that same exact area. They didn't step on it. So it wasn't

118
00:14:31.52 --> 00:14:36.88
necessarily fair that I had to be an, uh, an MPT. I didn't want to be an MPT, but

119
00:14:36.88 --> 00:14:44.88
none of that mattered. Um, it did, none of that had any bearing on whether or not I wanted to

120
00:14:44.88 --> 00:14:51.92
have an enjoyable life. And I did. I sat there and I was like, well, what is my mission in life?

121
00:14:52.72 --> 00:15:00.72
If you really take it to its base level, you know, have an impact, uh, enjoy my life. That doesn't

122
00:15:00.72 --> 00:15:07.52
change just because now I'm an MPT. And whether or not it's fair or the fact that I'm starting from a,

123
00:15:07.52 --> 00:15:12.64
you know, a little bit more of a disadvantage position now. All that stuff has no bearing on

124
00:15:13.20 --> 00:15:20.72
whether or not I want to accomplish my mission. And so realizing that you just kind of, well,

125
00:15:20.72 --> 00:15:27.28
what do I have to do now? That stuff's in the past. So all I can really affect is how I react to it.

126
00:15:27.28 --> 00:15:32.80
And, you know, so I think that's kind of how I, I skip all that stuff.

127
00:15:34.80 --> 00:15:42.000
Did you, I know, um, one, one thing that I remember and, you know, one of my guys Ryan Jobe,

128
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.80
he got, he got shot in the face and he got gravely wounded and, you know, he ended up blind.

129
00:15:46.80 --> 00:15:57.92
And, um, he went down with a lot of casualties that had a guy that had really bad brain injuries.

130
00:15:58.72 --> 00:16:05.92
Right. And he was there for a little while. And, you know, these were guys that had been severely wounded.

131
00:16:05.92 --> 00:16:11.12
And like I said, had severe brain injuries. So they're having trouble communicating. They're having trouble

132
00:16:11.12 --> 00:16:18.88
with motor skills. And, and these almost all the time come with other physical injuries. And, you know,

133
00:16:18.88 --> 00:16:25.68
his attitude was, hey, look, I'm taking up a bed here. And, and we should give it to someone else.

134
00:16:25.68 --> 00:16:30.96
These guys are having a much harder time than me. I'm lucky. Because I didn't get that injury.

135
00:16:30.96 --> 00:16:38.24
All I got was blind. And, you know, some, some damage to my face. But, right.

136
00:16:38.24 --> 00:16:46.96
It was, it was amazing to me to see a guy like Ryan Jobe who just looked at him

137
00:16:46.96 --> 00:16:52.000
himself and said, I'm lucky. I'm lucky. Those guys are worse off than me. Trying to give your

138
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.64
efforts to take care of these other guys instead of trying to take care of me. I can, I can do okay.

139
00:16:57.20 --> 00:17:02.16
Open up this bed for someone else to send me to a, send me somewhere else. And, that's what they did.

140
00:17:02.16 --> 00:17:09.76
And, I think that, you know, that attitude of like, hey, this could be much worse, right. And,

141
00:17:13.04 --> 00:17:20.16
to me, first of all, hearing him talk about that was, was a testament to like the spirit of a guy

142
00:17:20.16 --> 00:17:24.72
that just is going to carry on and drive on. And, the things that he did before he died

143
00:17:24.72 --> 00:17:32.64
were, was amazing. You know, he graduated college with like, with like a straight A grade point

144
00:17:32.64 --> 00:17:40.24
average, he got married. He, you know, his wife got pregnant. He's, he got a job with a defense

145
00:17:40.24 --> 00:17:44.96
contract. And, he was like totally on the path and crushing it. Despite the fact that he had,

146
00:17:46.16 --> 00:17:50.08
you know, one of the best excuses someone could have. Hey, I got wounded in a loss division. It

147
00:17:50.08 --> 00:17:55.60
didn't, didn't slow him down at all. He climbed around Mount Rainier. He just did amazing things. And,

148
00:17:55.60 --> 00:18:02.80
his attitude of look, I'm in a bad place, not that bad. I'm going to push on and, and like you said,

149
00:18:02.80 --> 00:18:08.16
this isn't going to, this isn't going to stop me from having a great life and, and getting after it,

150
00:18:08.16 --> 00:18:15.68
basically. Yeah. So, a couple of things. I'm glad you brought that up because there's definitely

151
00:18:15.68 --> 00:18:23.12
something to my own recovery during the time where I got there. So, it's kind of like, I almost had a

152
00:18:23.12 --> 00:18:29.60
a feedback loop on myself. So, I got, I was immediately thinking about even in the blast critters.

153
00:18:29.60 --> 00:18:33.20
I was like, one of my first thoughts was like, my mom's going to be pretty upset about this.

154
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.12
And when I woke up in Germany, the one thing that I did was I asked for a stupid hat. I was like,

155
00:18:41.12 --> 00:18:46.64
my squad leader is there and I said, see if you can find a stupid look in hat that I can wear

156
00:18:46.64 --> 00:18:52.000
when I come out of the ambulance that when my mom sees me for the first time, she'll see this

157
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.16
stupid hat and maybe it'll make her laugh a little bit. But, you know, obviously they didn't find one.

158
00:19:00.16 --> 00:19:09.36
And, but I think what happened was I had a good attitude in the first week or two. And then

159
00:19:09.36 --> 00:19:14.56
that kind of set a precedent for myself. And all my friends that came in, all my family that

160
00:19:14.56 --> 00:19:22.48
came in saw me with that solid positive attitude and that, you know, that gave them hope at the same

161
00:19:22.48 --> 00:19:27.44
time. So, they had that hope and then I kind of went on and there was times, you know,

162
00:19:28.08 --> 00:19:35.52
they saw me already like that. So, there was ever a time where I was feeling sorry for myself or anything

163
00:19:35.52 --> 00:19:41.44
like that. I was like, you know what? My mom, my dad, all these people have already seen me be

164
00:19:41.44 --> 00:19:48.16
in positive and if I flip that around, then that's going to hurt them now. And so I have to keep

165
00:19:48.16 --> 00:19:53.60
that in mind. So, when I'm, it's not really about, well, it's not only about me. So,

166
00:19:54.64 --> 00:19:59.12
that force, that's force me to make sure I maintain my positive attitude because, you know,

167
00:19:59.12 --> 00:20:02.88
they're depending on me. I'm depending on them at the same time. So, they're depending on me to

168
00:20:02.88 --> 00:20:07.84
say positive so that they can stay positive. And so, it kind of we kind of fed off each other.

169
00:20:08.56 --> 00:20:14.40
And so, you know, that just kind of snowballed, I guess, until, you know, here we are.

170
00:20:15.92 --> 00:20:22.16
Now, you get, so, so you're talking like a month of milkshakes and good milk, they weren't

171
00:20:22.16 --> 00:20:27.68
mint chocolate chip, but they were good, you know. And you're just feeding yourself, you're trying

172
00:20:27.68 --> 00:20:33.92
to heal up, get the wounds to actually heal. And every time you go around, every time you leave

173
00:20:33.92 --> 00:20:41.04
your bed, it's a gut check because you got to, you know, do the wound draining and all that other stuff.

174
00:20:42.48 --> 00:20:46.32
And then after a month, things are starting to heal up. And at what point did you,

175
00:20:46.32 --> 00:20:49.60
were you able to like get yourself out, get yourself in the wheelchair?

176
00:20:50.48 --> 00:20:54.40
I think I was probably after that first, so I was, I spent a week in the ICU,

177
00:20:54.40 --> 00:20:59.60
you know, high on morphine, I don't remember much from that time period. And then I get to the

178
00:20:59.60 --> 00:21:06.56
ward. And probably after that first week, maybe 10 days on the main ward, I'd be like,

179
00:21:06.56 --> 00:21:10.72
alright, I'm going to try and do this myself, guys. And then it took five times the length of

180
00:21:10.72 --> 00:21:19.20
time, but I did it. And then from then on, I was doing it on my own. And so, yeah, and that was kind

181
00:21:19.20 --> 00:21:24.64
of the biggest milestone for, you know, being in the hospital during that healing period,

182
00:21:25.36 --> 00:21:30.08
was being able to do that. And then, so, and then, you know, as they slowly took tubes away.

183
00:21:31.28 --> 00:21:37.44
And then the final milestone for being in the hospital at that point was when my wounds were

184
00:21:37.44 --> 00:21:43.44
finally sutured, closed. And I got the skin graft. I'd take a skin graft from my left leg and

185
00:21:43.44 --> 00:21:48.64
put it on the inside of my right thigh. And once they did that, and that was as they healed that,

186
00:21:48.64 --> 00:21:52.08
they checked it out. Make sure it was good. Then I was ready to be transferred over to

187
00:21:52.88 --> 00:21:58.24
Walthera. But I still had stitches. All in my or staples, staples are stitches, one or two.

188
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.16
And so, after that was done, that's when they transferred me over to Walthera. And even then,

189
00:22:06.16 --> 00:22:12.40
I still had to wait for those stitches to come out before I could get fitted for prosthetics.

190
00:22:13.12 --> 00:22:17.52
And I was probably in the inpatient hospital for another two weeks, while I waited for a room

191
00:22:17.52 --> 00:22:23.04
to open up in the outpatient housing. So, it was pretty similar in those first two weeks.

192
00:22:23.04 --> 00:22:27.76
I just had the IV line that's all I had. And, you know, I could go out.

193
00:22:27.76 --> 00:22:32.80
Are they pumping you with antibiotics the whole time? What do they, what do they got an IV in you for?

194
00:22:34.64 --> 00:22:39.84
Pain, medication. Okay. Um, and I think it's probably just a stand with the distinct case.

195
00:22:39.84 --> 00:22:44.80
Something goes wrong. They can, they have quick access. My buddy Daniel, he had a pick line

196
00:22:44.80 --> 00:22:50.40
to like straight into his heart. What's that? It's just, I think it's just a, uh, a tube. They just put it

197
00:22:50.40 --> 00:22:55.60
straight, put it into your chest. And I guess maybe it's just for quicker access for pain medication.

198
00:22:56.24 --> 00:23:00.80
So, I'd be in the hospital at first month. And, you know, they gave you the pain button. So, you

199
00:23:00.80 --> 00:23:07.60
can kind of control yourself. And to be funny, because they, they, it only meters out so much in an hour.

200
00:23:07.60 --> 00:23:11.92
You can hit it like once every five minutes or something. But in the first week, I'd be

201
00:23:11.92 --> 00:23:16.64
kind of passing out. And I, whenever I woke up, I'd hit it a couple times just to make sure I

202
00:23:16.64 --> 00:23:22.000
get in that dosage because I was scared. Like, what happens if this pain button goes away? Like,

203
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.72
I don't want to face that. And so they'd come in after an hour in the nurse say, you know,

204
00:23:26.72 --> 00:23:30.16
you can only hit this thing like that's every five minutes. Like, yeah, yeah, I know.

205
00:23:30.16 --> 00:23:37.28
So, what you've hit it like $200. The last hour. Oh, you know, I just hit it just, you know, I fall asleep.

206
00:23:37.28 --> 00:23:44.80
Yeah. And so then during that time, when you, when you were still had like stitches,

207
00:23:44.80 --> 00:23:49.20
but, and I know we talked about this a little bit, but you add like the triangle thing hanging

208
00:23:49.20 --> 00:23:53.12
above you. You start doing pull ups and you start trying to do some kind of upper body or

209
00:23:53.12 --> 00:23:58.80
work out at that time. Yeah. I mean, once I got to walk through, I met my physical therapist that day.

210
00:23:59.52 --> 00:24:03.60
And we set up the time I was going to come in seven o'clock for Archipassional Therapy,

211
00:24:03.60 --> 00:24:08.000
eight o'clock with physical therapy. And we'd be just doing stuff on the mat tables. So you don't have

212
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
to be wearing legs and you can be working on other stuff while you're waiting for that stuff to heal.

213
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.16
So yeah, I'd be doing kind of dips. I've raised my the arms and my wheelchair up really high and I do dips.

214
00:24:18.88 --> 00:24:24.56
And, you know, they had stuff you could do like a trunk strengthening exercises. You know, I,

215
00:24:24.56 --> 00:24:28.64
I was the first double above knee amputee to come through all three. We've been at war for nine

216
00:24:28.64 --> 00:24:34.88
years. So they had this, all of these exercises already set up. So I'd come in and I do my exercises

217
00:24:34.88 --> 00:24:41.12
lay a legless for the day and this work on what I could while we waited for that stuff to

218
00:24:41.12 --> 00:24:46.000
while we waited for my skin. We were just waiting on my skin basically to heal. How did you feel like

219
00:24:47.52 --> 00:24:51.76
how did you feel regaining your strength in your upper body? Were you like, were you like back

220
00:24:51.76 --> 00:24:56.96
on the gains path? You don't have any? Were you like, okay, I just did, you know, yesterday I did

221
00:24:56.96 --> 00:25:01.20
eight pull ups and today I'm going to do 10 and the next day I'm going to, did you get, did you get

222
00:25:01.20 --> 00:25:06.64
yourself right back in like the old school workout mode for? Oh yeah, just back on the path.

223
00:25:06.64 --> 00:25:12.000
Yeah, man, when I was still in, when I was still in the hospital at Bethesda,

224
00:25:15.04 --> 00:25:18.56
I, I would go in a physical thing, but you guys got to pull up bar or anything like that.

225
00:25:18.56 --> 00:25:23.52
And yeah, we have one, they had one and like a closet. And I was, and I saw, I want to do some

226
00:25:23.52 --> 00:25:27.36
pull ups. And so I set the pull-up record for people that had come through and they got broken

227
00:25:27.36 --> 00:25:35.84
by a seal later. But, so yeah, I set that pull up. Let me see, I've never lost the, the desire to

228
00:25:35.84 --> 00:25:39.04
see what I could do. You know, I was like, yeah, I'm going to do a max set of pull ups and see how

229
00:25:39.04 --> 00:25:44.64
many I could do still. But yeah, I was definitely frustrating because I was, I lost a lot of muscle

230
00:25:44.64 --> 00:25:51.36
mass. But, you know, once you start doing those exercises like every time I came in, I wanted to go

231
00:25:51.36 --> 00:25:57.92
at one more or two more or a little bit longer. And I had that same attitude when I started walking,

232
00:25:57.92 --> 00:26:03.76
you know, the first day I started walking. I'd maybe stood my legs for two minutes. The next day

233
00:26:03.76 --> 00:26:08.64
I was like, you know, I'm going to try three minutes today. Or last the yesterday I walked one time

234
00:26:08.64 --> 00:26:12.96
around the little track, I'm going to go twice, you know, just slowly build it up and, you know,

235
00:26:12.96 --> 00:26:17.44
keep that same. So what's that process? Like getting, getting, standing up for the first time,

236
00:26:17.44 --> 00:26:23.44
what does that feel like? It's wild. I mean, the first thing you got to do is you got to get

237
00:26:23.44 --> 00:26:30.40
casted. So they have to make the sockets that go onto your stumps. And they do it, they, they,

238
00:26:31.44 --> 00:26:37.84
they wrap this plaster around your stump and they, uh, mold it so that it's put in pressure on the

239
00:26:37.84 --> 00:26:44.24
right spots. And they take that off. They fill it up with some other kind of plaster material.

240
00:26:44.24 --> 00:26:52.08
Uh, they take the, the cast that they made off and then they pour plastic around it then.

241
00:26:53.12 --> 00:26:58.80
So then you have your, basically, the mold of your leg. And the first time you, the first time you

242
00:26:58.80 --> 00:27:04.000
step up in it, it did not comfortable at all. It hurts a lot because you're putting pressure on

243
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.28
points that you didn't before and they kind of have to, so you stand up and you're like, okay,

244
00:27:09.28 --> 00:27:13.84
well, there's a spot right back there that hurts a lot. So they take it off and they

245
00:27:13.84 --> 00:27:18.56
use this hair dryer, make it hot and they kind of mold it. They push it out against. So it's not

246
00:27:18.56 --> 00:27:23.20
against that spot anymore. And then you put it back on, okay, that's comfortable. And then you do it

247
00:27:23.20 --> 00:27:32.40
for the other one. And for me, yeah, I mean, I could, you could, you can't, I couldn't just walk

248
00:27:33.20 --> 00:27:39.44
from the first try ahead to have my arms on the, on the, uh, the parallel bars. It like it was,

249
00:27:39.44 --> 00:27:46.000
you know, that slow thing that you see kind of in movies where I took maybe 10 steps. And that was it

250
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.56
for my first time. I walk five. Is it like balance or is it, is it a little bit musculature? Like,

251
00:27:52.56 --> 00:27:57.52
is it your, do you use in different muscles? Yeah. So you definitely, you're walking in a different way

252
00:27:58.32 --> 00:28:04.72
then your body's designed to. So when you walk, you just go, you know, kind of forward and back

253
00:28:04.72 --> 00:28:09.44
your with your legs, you're bend it the knee to get it past the ground. So it doesn't skip on the

254
00:28:09.44 --> 00:28:16.56
ground. Whereas when you're double above knee, APT, uh, you have to swing your legs out to the side

255
00:28:16.56 --> 00:28:20.72
at first because you don't have that knee joint. You can't just bring them, you know, forward.

256
00:28:21.44 --> 00:28:27.52
So you kind of have to learn that. And it's a lot of the balance. You're, your musculature has to kind

257
00:28:27.52 --> 00:28:34.16
of get used to what muscles you're using to keep your balance now. So that has to be figured out by

258
00:28:34.16 --> 00:28:42.16
your, you know, brain and your spinal cord. And then on top of that, just developing the resistance

259
00:28:42.16 --> 00:28:47.60
to the, the discomfort. It's really not comfortable. And that's kind of probably what I didn't get

260
00:28:47.60 --> 00:28:53.52
tired. Like I could have stood for longer, but it's just my legs were hurting so bad. Yeah, like you,

261
00:28:53.52 --> 00:29:00.000
you could run a mile or you could run a marathon or whatever, but if you're, if you're, if you have

262
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.48
a blister on your toe, you know, then that's going to stop you. Yeah, it's, it seems like the balance thing.

263
00:29:07.04 --> 00:29:13.76
Like sometimes I've hurt my, like, let's say hurt my ankle or hurt my, even something as stupid

264
00:29:13.76 --> 00:29:19.60
as hurt, like had a big cut on my on the bottom of my foot. Yeah. And so you can't use your foot

265
00:29:19.60 --> 00:29:23.92
the way you normally do. And it totally throws off your balance. And I can't even imagine you're,

266
00:29:23.92 --> 00:29:29.60
you're now trying to balance through the, through the perception of your nerves in your, in your

267
00:29:29.60 --> 00:29:34.32
stumps. Yeah. And, and how that feels and how you got to kind of adjust for that. That's got to be

268
00:29:34.32 --> 00:29:41.28
like learning how to, like, skier something, learning how to do a balanced type sport, surf or

269
00:29:41.28 --> 00:29:44.32
something like that. I can, I can only imagine that that's got to be what it's like to get your

270
00:29:44.32 --> 00:29:49.04
brain. And like you said, your brain, your spinal cord to be able to adapt to what's happening

271
00:29:49.04 --> 00:29:55.36
underneath you when you, you have a totally new set of sensors down there now. Yeah. And you have to

272
00:29:55.36 --> 00:29:59.84
also keep, keep, keep, keep for a double above knee, and all the stuff I'm saying is just double above

273
00:29:59.84 --> 00:30:06.08
knee, and VT's. But you're also losing two joints that help with balance. So,

274
00:30:06.64 --> 00:30:10.88
an able body person, they have if they want to make a small adjustment, they use their ankle.

275
00:30:10.88 --> 00:30:14.96
And then they can use the knee. And then they can use the hip. But, you know, double above knee,

276
00:30:14.96 --> 00:30:20.56
we all we have is the hip. So it's an extra challenge learning how to make these adjustments with just

277
00:30:20.56 --> 00:30:27.76
just your hips. But, you know, it's a lot like a dog that has a missing leg. You know, the first

278
00:30:27.76 --> 00:30:33.12
time he goes to walk. He kind of just figures it out. And he learns that new method. And it's kind

279
00:30:33.12 --> 00:30:37.44
of, it's pretty much a similar thing. You, you know, you adapt to it. And you just do figure it out.

280
00:30:37.44 --> 00:30:44.000
And on the first prosthetics that you get are they articulated or they just like straight,

281
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.40
because I know what you've got now is pretty, they look pretty damn advanced to me. Yeah. I mean,

282
00:30:48.40 --> 00:30:52.80
I was just fancy you can get. Yeah. You look in like freaking term terminator robot over there.

283
00:30:52.80 --> 00:30:58.16
So what are you getting that first? Because is it articulating? Because, no. So yeah,

284
00:30:58.16 --> 00:31:05.60
it's in the balance in that realm, they keep you really short. While you're re-learning that

285
00:31:05.60 --> 00:31:11.04
balance, because just in case you fall. So while you're re-learning that balance, they keep you

286
00:31:11.04 --> 00:31:15.60
really short. So basically, if I was going to fall, I just put my hand out pretty much and

287
00:31:15.60 --> 00:31:22.000
catch myself on the ground. And so while you're re-learning this balance, they keep you nice and

288
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.08
short, because your center gravity is going to be lower. So it's a lot easier. And then also,

289
00:31:28.08 --> 00:31:33.04
you kind of learn that hit motion. So they keep you nice and short just to make it a lot easier.

290
00:31:33.04 --> 00:31:38.56
And then as you get better, as you get stronger and a little bit better moving around, they make

291
00:31:38.56 --> 00:31:44.56
you a little bit taller. But there's no need joint. It's just, you go from your socket. And

292
00:31:44.56 --> 00:31:51.20
there's a straight cylindrical pie lawn made out of metal. And that goes with a prosthetic foot.

293
00:31:51.20 --> 00:31:57.92
And you probably have a shoe on the foot. And then that's it. So you stay really short for three

294
00:31:57.92 --> 00:32:03.76
four months. And at this time, are you already thinking about, like, what kind of crazy stuff you're

295
00:32:03.76 --> 00:32:10.000
going to do? What you figure this shit out? Once I had found out about the Paralympics,

296
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.44
that was probably my first week when I was at Bethesda in the hospital bed,

297
00:32:13.44 --> 00:32:19.20
just researching, I wanted to get back in the gym. And I didn't know what I could,

298
00:32:19.20 --> 00:32:21.68
what I'd still be able to do in the gym. So I was maybe looking for,

299
00:32:22.72 --> 00:32:26.72
I forget what I searched, but like disabled sports or disabled working out or something like that.

300
00:32:26.72 --> 00:32:31.92
And I found the Paralympics. And at the time, I wasn't saying to myself, I'm definitely going to

301
00:32:31.92 --> 00:32:36.88
commit to going, because I didn't know much about it. And I still had this big, I still had to take,

302
00:32:36.88 --> 00:32:41.20
you know, a year and a half to, to really learn how to walk. And that was numerous, oh no,

303
00:32:41.20 --> 00:32:45.84
to learn how to do. But yeah, it was kind of in the back of my head. I had found about it.

304
00:32:45.84 --> 00:32:53.28
And I was thinking about, that's kind of how things work for me. I, the idea is impregnated initially.

305
00:32:53.28 --> 00:32:57.92
And like, okay, okay, that's an interesting idea. You know, Paralympics, okay, that's interesting.

306
00:32:57.92 --> 00:33:04.48
I go riding my bike cross-country. Okay, interesting. And then, I think about a little bit more

307
00:33:04.48 --> 00:33:09.44
and time goes on. I think, you, I, like, probably do that, you know, and then eventually,

308
00:33:09.44 --> 00:33:12.56
I'll get to a point where like, all right, I'm going to do it. And then I commit to it.

309
00:33:13.52 --> 00:33:18.88
And so at this point, you know, I hadn't committed to it. But I was researching and, you know,

310
00:33:18.88 --> 00:33:24.08
contemplating and figuring out the feasibility and, you know, how I would go about it if I wanted

311
00:33:24.08 --> 00:33:30.32
to try and make the attempt. That seems like that would have a massive positive impact

312
00:33:31.12 --> 00:33:34.80
on your mindset. So something that I've talked about, I talked about with Jordan Peterson and,

313
00:33:34.80 --> 00:33:41.76
he agreed with me on this idea of finding a new mission and having a new mission. So a lot of

314
00:33:41.76 --> 00:33:46.08
times, I'm sure you've seen this too. I've definitely seen it when guys get out of the military

315
00:33:46.08 --> 00:33:51.28
for whatever reason, when they get out the guys that do well are the guys that have a new mission

316
00:33:51.28 --> 00:33:55.84
to go on. And whether it's a new job or whether they're going to be a super dad or whether they're

317
00:33:55.84 --> 00:34:01.92
going to go to school and get good grades, those guys do good. And in their new mission,

318
00:34:01.92 --> 00:34:07.04
the guys that have the most trouble from what I've seen most of the time is the guys that don't have

319
00:34:07.04 --> 00:34:11.20
a new mission. They get out and they say, well, you know, I might do this, I might do that,

320
00:34:11.20 --> 00:34:14.96
I might do something else, but what they're really doing is nothing. They don't have any real

321
00:34:14.96 --> 00:34:21.60
direction and then up, you know, what's the mission? The mission becomes have another drink,

322
00:34:21.60 --> 00:34:27.20
you know, do something unproductive, do what feels good immediately and it becomes problematic.

323
00:34:27.20 --> 00:34:32.88
But it seems like the fact that you found something immediately, you realize that there was a

324
00:34:32.88 --> 00:34:38.24
goal that you could go after, even if it was only a little idea at first. That idea can carry you

325
00:34:38.24 --> 00:34:43.92
a long way. Yeah, and you know, also luckily for me, it wasn't like it was, it's not like I was

326
00:34:43.92 --> 00:34:50.80
in Afghanistan one day and then separated the next day. I kind of had a mission that was, you know,

327
00:34:50.80 --> 00:34:56.24
it came above about by its own because, you know, I just lost my legs. But first mission was

328
00:34:56.24 --> 00:35:01.28
to learn how to walk. So I had that right away. But, you know, while I was taking that time to

329
00:35:02.08 --> 00:35:06.08
do that, I was thinking about, you know, what I'm going to do after I get out. You know, every

330
00:35:07.12 --> 00:35:11.52
guy that gets out of the military, you know, most of the time, you know, when your contract's

331
00:35:11.52 --> 00:35:15.44
going to end, so you can start thinking about it earlier. But it's definitely, you know, I agree

332
00:35:15.44 --> 00:35:23.44
with you having something to work towards is hugely important. See, I'll tell you that, even

333
00:35:23.44 --> 00:35:30.32
what you just said, so there's people that they get out and you're saying, hey, I had this new

334
00:35:30.32 --> 00:35:33.28
mission because I had to at least learn how to walk. There's people that they get out and they

335
00:35:33.28 --> 00:35:38.56
don't have a new mission and they don't figure one out and that becomes so problematic. And

336
00:35:38.56 --> 00:35:43.28
you know what, let's not just apply it to the military, I'll apply this to every human being.

337
00:35:43.28 --> 00:35:47.36
Happens, kids get out of college, happens, kids get out of high school, happens when you go through,

338
00:35:47.36 --> 00:35:50.32
you know, you've got something that you're looking at or something that you're focused on,

339
00:35:50.32 --> 00:35:54.48
in boom, it goes away. Well, now what are you going to do? And if you don't line something up and

340
00:35:54.48 --> 00:35:58.56
don't focus on something, you don't take aim at something or then you're not going anywhere.

341
00:35:58.56 --> 00:36:02.32
Oh, yeah. It's like when you're, you know, how you shoot, do you guys call it table two?

342
00:36:02.96 --> 00:36:09.76
When you're kind of working on a shooting, like targets that are right in front of you?

343
00:36:10.32 --> 00:36:13.92
We don't call it table two. We call it table two is table one is kind of the long distance

344
00:36:13.92 --> 00:36:18.40
driver range. Okay. But it's almost kind of like when you're when you're doing that and you,

345
00:36:18.40 --> 00:36:22.64
they say, okay, shoot this guy twice in that guy twice. So you do that. And then at the end, you

346
00:36:22.64 --> 00:36:25.68
scan and make sure there's nobody else around. It's kind of like doing that. Your mission is

347
00:36:25.68 --> 00:36:29.92
the shoot the thing, but you also have to be looking out for other stuff. Yeah. Yeah. No, absolutely.

348
00:36:29.92 --> 00:36:34.40
You know, it's, it's funny too, because I think about like when you think about kids that you

349
00:36:34.40 --> 00:36:40.64
grew up with and like high school, they get done with high school. And there's some kids that

350
00:36:40.64 --> 00:36:44.80
oh, I'm going to go in the college. I'm going to go to military. Yeah. There's some kids that don't

351
00:36:44.80 --> 00:36:50.24
know what they're going to do after high school. And what happens to it? You know, what happens to them?

352
00:36:51.44 --> 00:36:55.84
They, they, they, they flounder around. They get a little job here that they don't really like. They

353
00:36:55.84 --> 00:37:00.08
do something else that they don't really like. You just have to be careful with that. Yeah. You have to be

354
00:37:00.08 --> 00:37:03.76
careful. And I'd say as a parent, that's just something to look out for too. You know, you

355
00:37:03.76 --> 00:37:09.04
gotta look out for your kids and make sure your kids have something to focus on, have something that

356
00:37:09.04 --> 00:37:14.24
they're striving for. Because if you don't have anything to strive for, if you're not trying to

357
00:37:14.24 --> 00:37:19.84
go anywhere, if you're not on some kind of mission, that's this problematic. Yeah. And, you know,

358
00:37:19.84 --> 00:37:27.04
so since I had that, everything I did during the day mattered to me because I had something that

359
00:37:27.52 --> 00:37:34.24
was vastly important to me that I was trying to achieve. So if I didn't care about whether or

360
00:37:34.24 --> 00:37:38.56
not I walked again, then I could just roll around in my wheelchair and it wouldn't matter if I

361
00:37:38.56 --> 00:37:44.80
worked out that day. But since I really, I learned how to walk again and be totally independent,

362
00:37:44.80 --> 00:37:49.28
and get rid of my wheelchair and all that stuff, and be able to run and do everything I was able

363
00:37:49.28 --> 00:37:55.60
to do before. That was, you know, the most important thing. And so I fed off that when,

364
00:37:56.88 --> 00:38:01.92
you know, I didn't feel like going into therapy because I was my backer to whatever. And the,

365
00:38:01.92 --> 00:38:11.44
you know, whether or not I do that third, fourth set of balanced drills or, you know, strengthening

366
00:38:11.44 --> 00:38:18.64
exercises, you know, that had an effect on that goal. And so, and the same thing with going to

367
00:38:18.64 --> 00:38:23.92
the parallel in the picks, you know, I wanted to be able to explore that. And so the stuff I was

368
00:38:23.92 --> 00:38:29.60
doing in the hospital, it mattered. So this is interesting because we're actually talking about this

369
00:38:29.60 --> 00:38:36.16
the other day. So you end up with, and again, I'm just trying to break down because obviously

370
00:38:36.16 --> 00:38:46.56
you're a person that that can push through pain and suffering and push through short-term

371
00:38:47.20 --> 00:38:56.32
challenges in order to achieve a long-term goal. And I think that the way you break it down is

372
00:38:56.32 --> 00:38:59.92
you're looking even when you're suffering from a challenge right now, you're, you know,

373
00:38:59.92 --> 00:39:03.12
I don't feel like doing another balance to your drill because my back is sore or whatever.

374
00:39:03.12 --> 00:39:06.64
Yeah. Well, people hit those kind of obstacles every single day. You know, they don't want to

375
00:39:06.64 --> 00:39:10.40
get up in the morning. They don't want to work out. They don't want to do the last set, etc, etc.

376
00:39:10.88 --> 00:39:17.76
But you had, you tie those small-term short-term things, the short-term pain,

377
00:39:17.76 --> 00:39:20.72
because you have a long-term goal. That's, you really care about.

378
00:39:20.72 --> 00:39:26.80
Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's, it's all a matter of what matters to you most. You know,

379
00:39:26.80 --> 00:39:32.80
what's more important to you learning, or for me, learning how to walk again, or

380
00:39:34.40 --> 00:39:39.84
staying in bed today. You know, staying in bed would be nice. It would feel good. I'd be able to watch.

381
00:39:40.72 --> 00:39:44.64
I think what I was watching on Netflix, I was watching 24 of the series at the time on the

382
00:39:44.64 --> 00:39:49.84
Netflix. So I could watch an entire series of 24 today or something. And I could do that,

383
00:39:49.84 --> 00:39:54.72
and that would be fun. But at the end of the day, I'm still not going to be any closer to

384
00:39:54.72 --> 00:40:00.88
being able to walk again. And I would much rather be able to walk everywhere I went

385
00:40:00.88 --> 00:40:07.92
totally independently than find out what happens to Jack Bauer. So, and then, you know, at the same

386
00:40:07.92 --> 00:40:15.44
time, you know, if you're working on what people like to, if you want to lose weight, you know,

387
00:40:15.44 --> 00:40:21.84
do you, would you rather have a milkshake, my mint chocolate milkshake, or would you rather,

388
00:40:23.20 --> 00:40:28.80
or a cookie dough milkshake? Would you rather have that milkshake, or would you rather,

389
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.44
you know, be able to run 10 miles or not get winded when you're walking with your kids,

390
00:40:35.44 --> 00:40:39.92
or being a plane with your kids, is that what, which one matters to you more? And I always pick

391
00:40:39.92 --> 00:40:45.52
that bigger one because, I mean, it's pretty straightforward for me. Yeah, the delayed

392
00:40:46.56 --> 00:40:52.08
gratification is the delayed gratification versus the insul gratification. The delayed, but much more

393
00:40:52.80 --> 00:40:59.20
enjoyable. Yeah, much more dribble definitely better and better for your whole life. Yeah,

394
00:40:59.20 --> 00:41:05.60
last longer, two by the way. Yeah. Yep. And in during, it's an enduring, lasting, longer, lasting,

395
00:41:05.60 --> 00:41:12.24
enduring thing that you end up with. That's what people need to tap into. That right there.

396
00:41:12.24 --> 00:41:16.32
That's good how you have a, like, a way, like, almost like a, I don't know, say scaffolding,

397
00:41:16.32 --> 00:41:19.92
but like a way to look at it. Like how you, when you're presented with like an option,

398
00:41:19.92 --> 00:41:23.60
you're, you're, you're conscious of it. Be you have a way to look at it where you're like,

399
00:41:23.60 --> 00:41:29.68
okay, which one is important to me? Which one? You know, is Jack Bauer and 24 important to you,

400
00:41:29.68 --> 00:41:33.92
or is walking important to me? You know, so most people, they just go on how they feel,

401
00:41:33.92 --> 00:41:39.12
you know, I really don't feel like doing this. So I'll do this. Or I really am in the mood for

402
00:41:39.12 --> 00:41:44.000
this. So I'll do it kind of thing. They don't like kind of, you know, we break it down like how you do.

403
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Just, just from moment to moment where you'll be like, okay, I have this way to look at it and

404
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.04
I'm going to look at it this way. And then I can read or behave, you know? That actually is helpful.

405
00:41:53.04 --> 00:41:59.60
That's pretty good way of looking at it. You put it into a binary calculation. Yeah.

406
00:41:59.60 --> 00:42:04.72
Right? Just, there's two options. Yeah. Don't go like, am I going to do the thing that's going to make,

407
00:42:04.72 --> 00:42:08.48
make me better in the long run or the thing that's going to make me worse in the long run?

408
00:42:09.52 --> 00:42:12.80
And feels good right now. Which one are you going to do? This is just baked that into a binary

409
00:42:12.80 --> 00:42:17.28
decision. Yeah. But you can make it really. So simple. Which one's important to me? And it's

410
00:42:17.28 --> 00:42:21.36
almost like a black or white. You know, which one looks more driving you? What's a driving your

411
00:42:21.36 --> 00:42:29.44
behavior? And then you can even take another step. Again, like the losing the weight.

412
00:42:29.44 --> 00:42:34.56
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You will either want to have the milkshake or you want to be able to,

413
00:42:35.60 --> 00:42:41.44
you know, walk around with you. Even if you don't care about, you know, being overweight or

414
00:42:42.32 --> 00:42:47.20
you're not being able to move your body around. You know, you can still lose the weight by

415
00:42:47.20 --> 00:42:53.52
figuring out what even if you don't feel like going on a diet. Like, what is it that necessitates

416
00:42:53.52 --> 00:43:00.32
you to go on the diet? And for me, so I didn't want necessarily to train every day for the

417
00:43:00.32 --> 00:43:04.48
Paralympics. I didn't necessarily want to ride my bike every day on my bike ride or run. I didn't

418
00:43:04.48 --> 00:43:11.92
necessarily enjoy doing that. I didn't feel like doing it. But I had to do that because my goal

419
00:43:11.92 --> 00:43:16.40
necessitated me to do that. So if you're struggling to get motivated to lose weight just for the

420
00:43:16.40 --> 00:43:22.08
sake of losing weight, find something that necessitates you to lose weight that really matters to you.

421
00:43:22.08 --> 00:43:28.88
Like, you know, not dying when you're 55 of a heart attack. That'll do it. There's there's

422
00:43:29.92 --> 00:43:35.76
three things that you talked about on the last podcast. But I kind of breathed it, breathed over them.

423
00:43:35.76 --> 00:43:39.92
And I realized when I listened to it again, I should have talked to you a little bit more in depth

424
00:43:39.92 --> 00:43:44.96
because I think it's helpful for people to hear. Again, to hear from you who's overcome

425
00:43:44.96 --> 00:43:49.60
incredible challenges, there's three things that you talked about. And it's actually in the journal

426
00:43:49.60 --> 00:43:56.32
which you have a journal online on Rob Jones journey.com. But and this is there as well. But

427
00:43:56.32 --> 00:44:00.48
number one is writing down goals. Number two is celebrating milestones. And number three is

428
00:44:00.48 --> 00:44:08.96
overcoming rationalization. So let's just break those down a little bit. How strict were you

429
00:44:08.96 --> 00:44:18.24
with writing down your goals? And do you still do that? Um, I don't, I guess I don't physically

430
00:44:18.24 --> 00:44:24.24
have a pen and paper and write it down. I think what I do now is I'll announce it or something like

431
00:44:24.24 --> 00:44:30.08
that or I'll make it known that that's what I'm planning on doing. Check. So when I decided to do my

432
00:44:30.08 --> 00:44:36.72
marathon challenge, I did it on Facebook or something or I'd put it on all my social media platforms

433
00:44:36.72 --> 00:44:41.36
and then it's out there. Now, okay, now I'm responsible for this. So you're being, this is beyond

434
00:44:41.36 --> 00:44:46.08
writing it down. Yes, it's like writing it down and it sounds to the world. Yeah, or telling people

435
00:44:46.08 --> 00:44:53.84
that you want to have the respect of like if I told my wife Pam, like I, I'm going to do this and

436
00:44:53.84 --> 00:45:00.40
she, she knows I'm a person that she respects me for living up to what I say I'm going to do.

437
00:45:00.40 --> 00:45:06.40
I don't want to lose her respect. So now even, even though I would have done it, regardless,

438
00:45:06.40 --> 00:45:11.20
I'm not saying I would have said I would do it and then that fall out or back out.

439
00:45:11.20 --> 00:45:14.40
I, you know, the mission, even if the mission became not important to me, there's another

440
00:45:15.28 --> 00:45:20.000
another aspect of that, you know, you've committed to it. And so that's another aspect of my

441
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.08
personality where not only do I want to help veterans, but now I've committed to some of my

442
00:45:26.08 --> 00:45:30.32
said I'm going to do and I've given my word. And now there's people that are kind of relying on me

443
00:45:30.32 --> 00:45:34.64
to do that. And if I, if I say I'm going to do it, then I say, oh, I'll never mind. I actually,

444
00:45:35.28 --> 00:45:40.80
I'm not going to do it. Then they're actually losing a little bit of hope maybe because they

445
00:45:40.80 --> 00:45:43.68
were, they were hoping I was going to do it and they were going to get something out of it. Now,

446
00:45:43.68 --> 00:45:49.44
now they're, they're, I'm not doing it. So they're kind of losing that benefit. Yeah,

447
00:45:49.44 --> 00:45:53.20
it's, yeah, so it's beyond writing it down. It's writing it down or announcing,

448
00:45:53.20 --> 00:46:04.72
announcing it, celebrating milestones. Yeah. So it's really hard to stay motivated when there's this

449
00:46:04.72 --> 00:46:13.44
obscure goal that is two years away or a year and a half away. And you're not really seeing

450
00:46:15.44 --> 00:46:22.16
huge progress towards every, you get like a millimeter every day. It gets old. You feel really

451
00:46:22.16 --> 00:46:26.88
motivated in the beginning, right? Because you're pumped up and you have tons of energy. And then

452
00:46:26.88 --> 00:46:32.16
when you, and at the end, you can see it, you can smell the barn, you can see it. So you find the extra

453
00:46:32.16 --> 00:46:37.68
energy in your, in yourself. But in that, that middle part where you're not, you're not even sure

454
00:46:37.68 --> 00:46:43.84
that you're going to be able to do it. And it's so far away. Like, man, I'm only like half way.

455
00:46:43.84 --> 00:46:47.76
And I still have, I've done all this stuff. And now I still have to do all that again.

456
00:46:47.76 --> 00:46:57.44
And it helps to pick stuff along the way that you know is going to, to be there that kind of, you know,

457
00:46:57.44 --> 00:47:04.08
all right, I'm not, I'm going for that far away thing. But right now I'm going to that. And that's what

458
00:47:04.08 --> 00:47:09.68
excites me. So when I was in the hospital getting in the wheelchair was my first little milestone.

459
00:47:10.32 --> 00:47:13.76
Yeah, I had a year and I didn't even know how long was in to take me to learn how to walk again,

460
00:47:13.76 --> 00:47:19.60
at least, I was thinking, like a year and a half, two years. You know, that's a long time and with a lot

461
00:47:19.60 --> 00:47:26.08
of work in between. So, all right, right now, just get into the wheelchair. And then, all right, well,

462
00:47:27.60 --> 00:47:31.84
learn how to do it on your own. And then after that, get your legs and then

463
00:47:33.36 --> 00:47:38.96
figure out how to walk with only one cane and set a two canes keeping you up. And then drop the other

464
00:47:38.96 --> 00:47:43.44
cane and that's another milestone. And then you get your bionic knees. And so you

465
00:47:44.16 --> 00:47:47.60
probably go back to the canes for a while. And then when you have those, you take away that

466
00:47:47.60 --> 00:47:52.08
cane and then take away the other one. And then you learn how to run and then you learn how to do

467
00:47:52.56 --> 00:47:56.96
ride the bike or whatever. So you just keep finding little things along the way. And you know,

468
00:47:56.96 --> 00:48:02.000
when I was doing, when I was training for triathlons, I'd do this on a small scale. I would have

469
00:48:02.40 --> 00:48:08.24
eight, two minute all out sprints on my bike to do. I'd be sitting there on the first one and like,

470
00:48:08.24 --> 00:48:12.40
oh my god, I have eight of these to do. I've been the first one, which is blowing me up.

471
00:48:12.40 --> 00:48:18.56
I've got, I've seven more. And I would just be like, you know what, just focus on this next one.

472
00:48:18.56 --> 00:48:23.44
Just do this one. And then we'll focus on the next one after that. And then so does,

473
00:48:24.32 --> 00:48:28.000
and I would even trick myself sometimes. I'd be like, all right, I would be on my six

474
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.28
one. I'd be so tired. I'm the arc, you know what? If I can maintain this speed, or if I can

475
00:48:33.28 --> 00:48:39.68
maintain my power output for this entire seventh one, I'll skip the eighth one. I'll treat myself.

476
00:48:39.68 --> 00:48:43.76
I'll skip the eighth one. I do the seventh one, but I do the eighth one because, you know,

477
00:48:43.76 --> 00:48:47.52
I do that sometimes. I do my self, you know. You work. So yeah.

478
00:48:47.52 --> 00:48:52.88
So it's interesting. So what you've talked with this dichotomy in this thing, and I've talked about this before,

479
00:48:52.88 --> 00:48:57.60
I've talked about before multiple times. I don't even know if I've talked about the, I must talk about the

480
00:48:57.60 --> 00:49:03.84
podcast, but I've talked about it with people, which is you have long-range stuff, and you have short-range

481
00:49:03.84 --> 00:49:08.24
stuff. And what you have to do is you have to put the both rows in your mind, and you have to shift

482
00:49:08.24 --> 00:49:14.16
the focus back on for, back and forth between the two, to whichever one is going to get you moving.

483
00:49:14.16 --> 00:49:18.40
Because when the goal is too far away, you're like, you know, one is not going to really make a

484
00:49:18.40 --> 00:49:22.64
difference if I skip this thing today. It's not that big of a deal. The goal is too far away. It

485
00:49:22.64 --> 00:49:27.36
gets blurry. And so what you need is you need to put, okay, just to do this short goal.

486
00:49:27.36 --> 00:49:32.72
Well, after the daily grind beats you down on the short goal, you start to forget what the long-term

487
00:49:32.72 --> 00:49:36.000
goal is. And you guys, you know what? I don't really need to do this workout today, or I don't need to

488
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.24
do, I can eat this food or I can do whatever because it's not going to make a big impact on the long

489
00:49:40.24 --> 00:49:43.76
thing. You know, what am I doing anyways? Then you got to look back at the long goal. And that's

490
00:49:43.76 --> 00:49:48.24
right. I have this, this thing that I'm trying to make happen. And it's these small goals that are

491
00:49:48.24 --> 00:49:53.68
going to get me there. So you've got to shift, you've got to have both the long-term goal. That's

492
00:49:53.68 --> 00:49:59.20
got to be something that you really want to achieve. You got to understand why, you know, like you

493
00:49:59.20 --> 00:50:03.12
said, you got to understand why it is you want to achieve it. You can't just be something that you don't

494
00:50:03.12 --> 00:50:07.92
care about. And then you got to have that as your primary driving force, but your secondary driving

495
00:50:07.92 --> 00:50:12.80
force, which is equally important is these short-term things that you can get to that are there,

496
00:50:12.80 --> 00:50:18.08
that are close, that are you can achieve, even if it's two minutes. Even if it's, I did to

497
00:50:18.08 --> 00:50:26.24
about to, to bought on the airbike the other day. Bro, yeah, I was there. I was like, you know,

498
00:50:26.24 --> 00:50:30.88
and my daughter was there. My restful daughter that wrestles, she was there. And so she's kind of like

499
00:50:30.88 --> 00:50:35.68
calling me out. But then it apostated. She's like a positive person. Yeah, right, man. Yeah, she was

500
00:50:35.68 --> 00:50:40.96
hyping me. And I put out hard because she was there. Come on. You know what it's like when your

501
00:50:40.96 --> 00:50:45.28
your daughter's going to come on dad, push harder. You're like, oh, awesome. Yeah, I'm going to get

502
00:50:45.28 --> 00:50:49.68
something. I wanted to die. You know, you know, the bloodtasing your mouth, you know?

503
00:50:49.68 --> 00:50:53.84
Oh, that cut up her taste. Yeah, that copper taste. Yeah, whatever that thing is. So I had some of

504
00:50:53.84 --> 00:50:58.48
that going on. But, but yeah, you have the short-term and you have the long-term goals. You got to

505
00:50:58.48 --> 00:51:04.40
have them both. And you got to, they've got to be attached somehow, but you got to lean on which one

506
00:51:04.40 --> 00:51:10.24
is going to get you to do what you know you're supposed to do. You know you're supposed to do.

507
00:51:10.24 --> 00:51:16.32
That's a little psychology behind just getting after it. Yeah. Right. Yes. A little psychology behind

508
00:51:16.32 --> 00:51:20.64
just getting after it. Little head games. You echoed and I were talking the other day. And he was

509
00:51:20.64 --> 00:51:25.52
all, he was kind of surprised because I was talking about there's there's one workout that I do,

510
00:51:25.52 --> 00:51:32.96
which is it's I it's my hardest and most brutal workout. And it's in it's in the field manual.

511
00:51:32.96 --> 00:51:41.28
But it's a 20 rep squat. You do you do you take a weight that you can squat 10 times and you do it

512
00:51:41.28 --> 00:51:52.64
20 times. And like after rep 12 every single rep is just it's just it's a it's pain. And then you

513
00:51:52.64 --> 00:51:57.12
do that and then you lay on the floor for 20 minutes and then you get up and you do it again and

514
00:51:57.12 --> 00:52:00.40
you lay on the floor for 20 minutes and you get up and do it again. So it's three sets in one hour.

515
00:52:00.40 --> 00:52:06.32
It's a one hour workout. But I was telling echo. I was like, yeah, there's times where I'm in the middle of like

516
00:52:06.32 --> 00:52:13.60
set two and I'm on rep 14 and I'm like I don't even I don't even think I want to be strong. I don't want to be strong.

517
00:52:13.60 --> 00:52:19.68
I don't even care from healthy. I just want to I just want to just this is this is horrible. Why would I be doing this right now?

518
00:52:19.68 --> 00:52:28.48
It's a stupid. Yeah, really, but but actually what gets me to push through those is I think to myself.

519
00:52:28.48 --> 00:52:37.36
Oh, you hear that? That's actual weakness in your mind right now. Actual living weakness gets a voice in your mind right now.

520
00:52:37.36 --> 00:52:41.76
Are you going to listen to it? Are you going to listen to it? No, you're not going to listen to it.

521
00:52:41.76 --> 00:52:48.56
Are you doing them straight through or are you? Yes, that's it's it's an old school workout that I originally got from well,

522
00:52:48.56 --> 00:52:56.72
there's a book called Super Squats. Good stuff. There's a book called Super Squats. If and that book has this work up.

523
00:52:56.72 --> 00:53:08.08
But actually that book only has you do one set you do one set. I was the idiot that sought to myself well of one set is good. How about I do three sets of that?

524
00:53:08.72 --> 00:53:14.24
And it's brutal. It's brutal. Yeah. Once you think of it. It's like well, I have to do it now. Yeah.

525
00:53:14.24 --> 00:53:19.44
No, that's another thing. That's another thing I say is, you know, if you don't really feel like working out, okay, that's fine.

526
00:53:19.44 --> 00:53:26.96
Write down what you're going to do and then just do it. Just turn off your brain and just do what you're supposed to do. Just put the numbers down and do what you're supposed to do.

527
00:53:27.76 --> 00:53:29.76
You're not every day is all

528
00:53:30.24 --> 00:53:36.16
Happy, you know, this is great. I feel myself getting stronger. No, I feel like I'm going to puke.

529
00:53:37.28 --> 00:53:42.24
That's not cool. But that's good. That's like a like kind of like you're talking about how

530
00:53:42.72 --> 00:53:47.28
If you go by how you feel every day like I feel like doing this or feeling whatever you're feeling

531
00:53:47.28 --> 00:53:54.88
where just like are you saying or are you you are in the habit of looking at it a certain way like what's important to me.

532
00:53:54.88 --> 00:53:58.56
Kind of how you feel is kind of shuffled to the side. What's important? Okay. Now

533
00:53:59.52 --> 00:54:02.72
I'm going to get moving. Yeah. Fueings are not.

534
00:54:03.60 --> 00:54:11.92
Not bad generally not a good thing to rely on to make things. Yeah. To rely generally not a good thing. But it can trick you though.

535
00:54:11.92 --> 00:54:16.32
You know how like just like how you're saying in the beginning, you know when you first decide to do something.

536
00:54:16.32 --> 00:54:20.16
Yeah. You know like New Year's resolution, whatever, you know like it's real common thing.

537
00:54:20.16 --> 00:54:26.80
We're at the beginning exciting. Let's start this new thing. And then at the end it can be because you see the goal right there.

538
00:54:26.80 --> 00:54:32.56
We're about to do it. You know kind of thing but in the middle. It's like yeah. So feeling can I don't want to say

539
00:54:33.04 --> 00:54:38.48
Yeah, you're right. Don't rely on it. But it can trick you because in the beginning when you have that feeling like you want to.

540
00:54:38.48 --> 00:54:41.12
It's like it's almost like you think it's going to be there the whole time. Yeah.

541
00:54:41.12 --> 00:54:47.12
You know, this new thing. This is the new thing for me. I've never felt anything like this about anything I've ever done.

542
00:54:47.12 --> 00:54:52.24
I'm excited about this one. And it goes away. And you always want to do it. Always have that energy at the end.

543
00:54:52.24 --> 00:54:58.72
Like of a I bet like the last. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The last one.

544
00:54:58.72 --> 00:55:01.76
It's like well, where was all that energy? Yeah. And it's like,

545
00:55:02.80 --> 00:55:08.72
Have you guys ever heard of the central governor theory of fatigue? No. Well, it's basically about

546
00:55:08.72 --> 00:55:14.56
it's a different. So see if I can do this without making it super long. There's two different.

547
00:55:14.56 --> 00:55:24.32
We got eight hours recording time. There's two different theories on how your body, I guess process is fatigue or what it exactly is.

548
00:55:24.32 --> 00:55:29.52
And so there's the I think it's called the catastrophic theory where basically

549
00:55:30.32 --> 00:55:36.96
you're during utabadas and something breaks down and then like you run out of energy totally

550
00:55:36.96 --> 00:55:42.56
to plead yourself of glycogen or whatever. And then you you can't because you don't have any more glycogen.

551
00:55:42.56 --> 00:55:48.96
So you muscles just don't work. And then there's this other theory which is kind of the accepted theory now

552
00:55:49.76 --> 00:55:57.36
that your brain has a governor in it. And it's it's getting all this information from your muscles and

553
00:55:57.36 --> 00:56:02.88
your senses all it's getting all this information. It's calculating how much energy it

554
00:56:02.88 --> 00:56:07.84
meters out. And so when you're doing your tobadas, the first one you have all sorts of energy. So you're

555
00:56:07.84 --> 00:56:11.92
you're brain's like, go. And it's connected to your subconscious and your conscious are kind of connected.

556
00:56:11.92 --> 00:56:16.16
So you kind of know how many sets you do and your brain actually calculate that's

557
00:56:16.16 --> 00:56:21.12
calculate to that into it's how it decides to do this. So that first one you're like,

558
00:56:21.12 --> 00:56:27.04
Oh, tons of glycogen available to me. So I can just blow through this first one. And then as you go,

559
00:56:27.04 --> 00:56:35.84
your brain is getting the signals that you're running your unedic glycogen. Maybe the

560
00:56:36.64 --> 00:56:42.16
calcium to contract the muscles is kind of getting low. And so it kind of dials you back

561
00:56:43.12 --> 00:56:48.72
automatically by contracting less muscle fibers. And so you kind of get and it makes you feel

562
00:56:48.72 --> 00:56:54.08
fatigues. So they say that fatigue is actually fatigue and pain are actually emotion. So it makes you

563
00:56:54.08 --> 00:57:02.64
feel is emotion fatigue is alive. So it makes you feel this and it kind of dials you back. And then

564
00:57:02.64 --> 00:57:08.24
on that last one you know that this is your last one. So it's like, all right, well, we're done after

565
00:57:08.24 --> 00:57:14.08
this so I'm going to let it go. And then so that's the theory. So yeah, it's kind of, so there

566
00:57:14.08 --> 00:57:17.84
is this thing called the gold, I think I told you this gold G 10, I think I'm pronouncing it

567
00:57:17.84 --> 00:57:23.76
correctly. Gold G 10 didn't origin a little regulator. And they're essentially like clusters of

568
00:57:23.76 --> 00:57:28.56
nerves that going in. And so this is more like high intensity. Like I'm going to do a two rep one

569
00:57:28.56 --> 00:57:34.88
rep two rep through your rep or whatever max. So that's regulated by your brain. So when you get too

570
00:57:34.88 --> 00:57:38.72
much stress on your muscle, your brain says, hey, that's too much stress. You're going to stop the

571
00:57:38.72 --> 00:57:44.64
muscle contraction or let off. Usually it stops it. That's why if you go for a two rep max one

572
00:57:44.64 --> 00:57:50.64
rep max, you can get it here and then you just poop and it fails. You fail. But if you can get

573
00:57:50.64 --> 00:57:54.48
it, if it doesn't fire, you go, oh, and you'll push, you'll push, sometimes you'll pause.

574
00:57:54.48 --> 00:57:58.96
Yeah. And you can still put like, why did you just fail the other time? You know what I mean?

575
00:57:58.96 --> 00:58:06.40
Yeah. It's that. So, and then if you go to lower intensity stuff, then it goes more into the

576
00:58:06.40 --> 00:58:13.20
like, like, you ever seen like a marathon runner or, you know, some real long, like, I don't

577
00:58:13.20 --> 00:58:17.36
know an obstacle course or the guy's like mentally, you can tell he's, he's not going to quit.

578
00:58:17.36 --> 00:58:21.28
Yeah. But his legs are like shivering and shaking and he, it's like he's almost like,

579
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.72
he's going to pass out or something like that. Yeah. So that's more that. That's like your physical

580
00:58:26.72 --> 00:58:31.76
capability, the energy, the physical energy system is failing. That's, you know, so that's a different

581
00:58:31.76 --> 00:58:35.76
thing. So it's funny though. You've been like, I'm sure when you're in boot camp or going through

582
00:58:35.76 --> 00:58:39.60
buds, like, how many push-ups are you going to do? You're just going to keep doing push-ups.

583
00:58:39.60 --> 00:58:42.72
Yeah. You literally just keep doing push-ups and push-ups and push-ups and push-ups and push-ups

584
00:58:42.72 --> 00:58:45.12
and push-ups and push-ups and push-ups and push-ups and push-ups and push-ups and push-ups. And sometimes

585
00:58:45.12 --> 00:58:50.24
you lay there on flat on your face for like 20 seconds. But then they say keep going and say,

586
00:58:50.24 --> 00:58:54.32
you just keep going and then you keep going for a little while and then you lay on your face for a

587
00:58:54.32 --> 00:59:00.80
little while and then you keep going, like you can just keep going more. Yeah. Unless you get to that.

588
00:59:01.68 --> 00:59:07.52
Now, sometimes on like a run, someone would pass out and like that would be that. Yeah.

589
00:59:07.52 --> 00:59:12.48
What's that? Yeah. That's the most important. That's the real thing. You're brain basically

590
00:59:12.48 --> 00:59:15.60
shut you. So you see somebody running at the end of a marathon and they're like,

591
00:59:16.88 --> 00:59:22.40
like, their legs aren't working. That's kind of their body. They've been able to somehow push through

592
00:59:22.40 --> 00:59:25.84
all the pain and all that stuff. They've been able to put, they've been motivated to push through.

593
00:59:26.56 --> 00:59:30.96
And then finally your body gets to a point that if we keep going, we are going to die. So I'm

594
00:59:30.96 --> 00:59:35.92
shutting you down and it just hits the, hits the shut down button and then your legs are stop where

595
00:59:35.92 --> 00:59:40.80
it will just stop contracting your muscles. Yeah. Or I don't remember how we got on this subject.

596
00:59:40.80 --> 00:59:46.80
Yeah. I'm pushing through. Pushing through. Yeah. Yeah. But it's like the engine is still going,

597
00:59:46.80 --> 00:59:51.52
but the fuel doesn't get to the engine. So the engine starts, you know, the engine is not on

598
00:59:51.52 --> 00:59:57.52
situation. But in like a higher intensity stuff, it seems like, you know, it given what I know,

599
00:59:57.52 --> 01:00:02.24
but the goal G10 in Oregon situation. Seems like you're a goal G10 in expert. Yes, but well,

600
01:00:02.24 --> 01:00:06.96
here, this is, this is when I really, I learned about it in college, but when I tore my bicep,

601
01:00:06.96 --> 01:00:11.36
you know, you know, guys will live real hard and just tear their muscle off their bone. Yeah.

602
01:00:11.36 --> 01:00:17.68
Because when you train heavy, you're training to to to what is to mitigate the effects of the

603
01:00:17.68 --> 01:00:22.24
goal G10 in our, that's a, or like huge rushes of adrenaline. We'll do it too. You know, you hear the

604
01:00:22.24 --> 01:00:27.04
story about them. The lady, she saw the car. That's the car. Yeah. Oh, the kid. Yeah. So

605
01:00:27.04 --> 01:00:32.08
basically you're just bypassing the goal G10 in Oregon because of these extreme situations. Yeah.

606
01:00:32.08 --> 01:00:36.000
But by nature, try lift up a car. You kind of can't. And the same, I mean, the bent, you know,

607
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:43.84
the, you know, most of us can't, you're kind of can't. When you're doing like a one-rette

608
01:00:43.84 --> 01:00:48.48
max, like you were when you test for that, you see it all the time where, you know, the guy,

609
01:00:48.48 --> 01:00:53.28
let's say, I don't know, he does 355, right? Like he even there's like a pause because it's pushing

610
01:00:53.28 --> 01:00:58.64
so hard and he's barely any getting gets it put on 360, 5.5 pounds more. He gets it like a quarter

611
01:00:58.64 --> 01:01:03.36
of the way up and it just falls on his chest, you know, because it fires and boom, muscle shut down.

612
01:01:03.36 --> 01:01:07.92
That's what that is. Yeah. When you're doing the heavy, you're also teaching, you're kind of teaching

613
01:01:07.92 --> 01:01:13.44
your body to like you most people can only contract 30% of their muscles at one time because their

614
01:01:13.44 --> 01:01:17.12
brain doesn't let them because if they contracted all of your muscle fibers at the same time,

615
01:01:17.12 --> 01:01:22.48
it could produce an injury. Yeah. So when you lift heavy, your brain is kind of learning,

616
01:01:23.12 --> 01:01:27.20
all right, I can, I can contract this many. Oh, okay. Now I can contract this many and like the

617
01:01:27.20 --> 01:01:32.56
best people still can only contract like 50% of their muscle fibers. Like Olympic lifters. Yeah. That's

618
01:01:32.56 --> 01:01:40.88
like, because they're just, yeah, exactly. Or like really heavy power lifters. So now on the

619
01:01:40.88 --> 01:01:47.52
last podcast, we talked about the Paralympic rowing. So and we talked about you biking across

620
01:01:47.92 --> 01:01:54.16
across the country again, which is from Maine to San Diego and again, if you want to people

621
01:01:54.16 --> 01:02:00.40
should go listen to those on podcast 92 and but when you were on last time, you were talking about

622
01:02:00.40 --> 01:02:05.36
your latest announcement, your latest goal that you had written down in an ounce of everybody,

623
01:02:05.36 --> 01:02:13.68
which was that you were going to run 31 marathon in 31 days, which is just kind of a little bit

624
01:02:13.68 --> 01:02:20.32
psycho. And actually you wrote down, I'm going to read this excerpt from your from your online journal.

625
01:02:22.56 --> 01:02:29.60
Here we go. Back to the journal. I can't. This is an expression that is vilified in our minds

626
01:02:29.60 --> 01:02:34.32
beginning at a young age. Every time a young child announces this decision, they are corrected.

627
01:02:35.28 --> 01:02:40.16
The first adult that hears it asks them whether or not they have even tried. Generally,

628
01:02:40.16 --> 01:02:45.52
this confrontation was the child giving their task another attempt until their attention span

629
01:02:45.52 --> 01:02:51.12
moves onto something else. The dole. See this and chuckle to themselves with knowledge that this is

630
01:02:51.12 --> 01:02:57.52
just a child who is yet to learn the art of art and virtue of perseverance. By the time this child

631
01:02:57.52 --> 01:03:02.08
comes of age, however, they will have been told by adults more times than they could count

632
01:03:02.08 --> 01:03:09.20
that there is no such thing as can't. It is interesting then to think about how many adults seem

633
01:03:09.20 --> 01:03:15.68
to proclaim this expression in their lives. It is because is it because like many things that

634
01:03:15.68 --> 01:03:20.40
adults tell children, they are simply telling the child a general rule that the child must follow,

635
01:03:20.40 --> 01:03:26.40
but can be broken once one is grown. Or is it because these adults are simply repeating what

636
01:03:26.40 --> 01:03:33.36
they were told as children without thoroughly examining what the phrase I can't truly suggest.

637
01:03:34.80 --> 01:03:40.000
If you confronted an adult that claims they can't do something with the same question about whether

638
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.000
not they have tried, the answer will almost always be yes. A adults have learned enough to know

639
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.12
that is unreasonable to say they can't until they have at least tried once. Therefore,

640
01:03:51.12 --> 01:03:56.64
the real question that we should be asking in responses, have you tried everything?

641
01:03:58.72 --> 01:04:04.96
Have you exhausted every possible option, scenario, combination, tool, and approach?

642
01:04:06.32 --> 01:04:11.36
I did not simply refer to the ones that you knew of at the time you decided to undertake your task.

643
01:04:11.36 --> 01:04:17.20
I mean, have you also research possibilities that you hadn't known about? Have you determined

644
01:04:17.20 --> 01:04:22.48
whether or not there is another person out there that has performed the exact same task you

645
01:04:22.48 --> 01:04:29.12
are attempting or at least something similar? Have you exhausted this research? Have you read every book,

646
01:04:29.12 --> 01:04:37.52
blog, journal, magazine, bathroom stall, and website? If the answer to any of these questions is no,

647
01:04:37.52 --> 01:04:42.56
then go back and try again because if you don't, because you don't truly know if you can do something

648
01:04:42.56 --> 01:04:51.04
until you've tried absolutely everything. The fact of the matter is that rarely, if ever, is the answer

649
01:04:51.04 --> 01:04:57.68
to all these questions, yes. Therefore, what does it that people actually mean when they say,

650
01:04:57.68 --> 01:05:07.20
I can't. A more accurate, but more for both ways of saying it would be, I don't care about or want

651
01:05:07.20 --> 01:05:14.96
enough this task or the resultant benefits of it in order to do all that is necessary to achieve it.

652
01:05:16.80 --> 01:05:21.76
I was told countless numbers of times by people during my month of marathons that they couldn't

653
01:05:21.76 --> 01:05:29.12
run one marathon, let alone 31 straight. Every now and then when I had time, I would discuss what they'd

654
01:05:29.12 --> 01:05:36.48
said. We would jointly conclude that if something they cared about and depended on them doing so,

655
01:05:36.48 --> 01:05:43.52
it would be possible. The most common example I used was if someone had a gun to your child's head,

656
01:05:43.52 --> 01:05:51.28
do you think you could do it then? Therefore, the phrase, I can't, denotes a lack of investment

657
01:05:51.28 --> 01:05:57.76
as opposed to a lack of potential or ability. I do not mean to say that every person I had this

658
01:05:57.76 --> 01:06:03.28
conversation with should have had the motivation to run marathons. It was something that I decided

659
01:06:03.28 --> 01:06:10.24
to do, not them. I merely wanted to express to them what I am expressing here, given the right purpose

660
01:06:10.96 --> 01:06:20.72
and enough time you can. What happens if someone has said they can't? We have asked

661
01:06:21.68 --> 01:06:30.000
them if they've done everything and the rare cases happen and they honestly say yes, do we

662
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.24
concede that they can't? Nope. If everything in existence has been attempted enough to determine

663
01:06:36.24 --> 01:06:41.68
that it won't work, then congratulations, you've been awarded the honor of being the person who must

664
01:06:41.68 --> 01:06:48.24
invent the method or the tool or determine the right combination, whether or not you will,

665
01:06:48.24 --> 01:06:54.88
once again boils down to how much you care and time. It manned up being that a person ends up

666
01:06:54.88 --> 01:07:01.44
trying for their entire life, but I suggest removing the phrase, I can't, from your lexicon

667
01:07:01.44 --> 01:07:11.68
and replacing it with, I can't yet do this so that you don't risk being on your death bed saying,

668
01:07:12.96 --> 01:07:23.36
I didn't. So, and I don't mean to, like if somebody comes up and says, I can't do something,

669
01:07:23.36 --> 01:07:32.88
I'm not going to say, I know what they're really saying, I'm not going to judge them. I don't care

670
01:07:32.88 --> 01:07:41.12
if you don't care about this thing, it doesn't matter to me, but you should just be a little bit more

671
01:07:41.92 --> 01:07:48.48
accurate in what you're saying. If you say I can't run a marathon, you don't want to run a marathon,

672
01:07:48.48 --> 01:07:53.52
you don't care about it, it doesn't matter to you, and that's your personal choice, you know, but to say

673
01:07:53.52 --> 01:07:59.36
that you can't do it, having never even attempted it is just not an accurate statement.

674
01:08:00.48 --> 01:08:04.72
So where did you get the idea to attempt 31 marathon in 31 days? So,

675
01:08:07.12 --> 01:08:12.40
after my bike ride, I tried to make the parallel Olympics for a triathlon, and I did not succeed

676
01:08:12.40 --> 01:08:19.04
to fail in that attempt, but with every failure there is a lesson learned and I learned when I was

677
01:08:19.04 --> 01:08:24.24
training for a triathlon that I was pretty good at running. I was able to run the 5k triathlon,

678
01:08:24.80 --> 01:08:30.56
5k distance at the end of the triathlon at 18 minutes flat, which is pretty fast. That's maxing out

679
01:08:31.20 --> 01:08:38.000
the Marine Corps PFT, you can't get any faster than that. So, it's pretty fast, so I realized,

680
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.64
you know, I've decent, decent talent for running, and I'd run the Marine Corps marathon the year

681
01:08:44.64 --> 01:08:51.92
before, and I knew that I could run a marathon. And I was just kind of, you know, after this failed

682
01:08:51.92 --> 01:08:54.72
attempt to make the parallel Olympics, because it's kind of thinking about what my next mission

683
01:08:54.72 --> 01:09:01.44
could be, and I wanted to do another thing like my bike ride, and I had heard about other people

684
01:09:01.44 --> 01:09:06.72
doing this kind of thing where they do, you know, 50 marathons and 50 days and 50 states or 50

685
01:09:06.72 --> 01:09:12.40
iron man, and 50 days and 50 states. So, you know, I decided I wanted to do marathons,

686
01:09:13.92 --> 01:09:19.76
and I kind of put my own little spin on it, and I said, well, you know what, I want to get this

687
01:09:19.76 --> 01:09:29.12
story in front of as many eyeballs as I can. So, to do 50 marathons, to do 31 marathons straight,

688
01:09:29.12 --> 01:09:33.76
in my backyard isn't really going to do that. So, I need to do a hike. I could go down to the

689
01:09:33.76 --> 01:09:38.08
trail every day for 31 straight and do it, and nobody would ever care, and nobody would have

690
01:09:38.08 --> 01:09:42.56
refined out about it. And to be the same amount of, it'd be just as impressive to do.

691
01:09:45.12 --> 01:09:49.20
And so, all right, I want to get this in front of as many eyeballs as possible. So, I need to do it

692
01:09:49.20 --> 01:09:54.000
in major cities where there's a lot of people that can find out about it and spread it that way.

693
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.84
And so, I figured, all right, I'll take that same formula and do 31 marathons in

694
01:09:59.84 --> 01:10:06.000
all in different cities. And I picked 31 because I was trying to figure a good number. So,

695
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.60
I started with the 20 number, which is the number associated with number of veterans suicides

696
01:10:11.60 --> 01:10:16.72
every day. I figured that'd be a pretty powerful number. But after the thing about that, I kind of figured

697
01:10:18.32 --> 01:10:24.72
it wasn't enough. It wasn't enough marathons in a row. And I figured by the time,

698
01:10:24.72 --> 01:10:30.32
more marathons today. By the time I got started with that, I'd be, and by the time I got kind of

699
01:10:30.32 --> 01:10:34.88
some momentum going, it pretty much be over. And so, I didn't figure it out as big an impact. So,

700
01:10:34.88 --> 01:10:40.16
I want to do more. So, I was like, well, what about 50? And so, I was like, well, okay, 50,

701
01:10:40.16 --> 01:10:47.76
I could probably do it if I trained enough for it. But 50 might be too many. It might be too long.

702
01:10:47.76 --> 01:10:52.40
So, by the time I started getting going, and then I, you know, I'm at 40. I still have

703
01:10:52.40 --> 01:10:57.36
10 more. People are going to kind of maybe lose interest. And I was like, oh, is that guy still doing

704
01:10:57.36 --> 01:11:03.92
that? Because I found out about the iron cowboy doing his 50 iron man's in 50 days. And I kind

705
01:11:03.92 --> 01:11:07.60
of had that same thing where, oh, he's going to be awesome. I was following him for the first

706
01:11:08.32 --> 01:11:13.12
couple weeks, and then eventually I'm like, oh, is he still, is he even finished it? Oh, well,

707
01:11:13.12 --> 01:11:16.40
kind of lost interest. I'm like, all right, well, what if I just did it for a month? I think people

708
01:11:16.40 --> 01:11:20.48
could probably pay attention for a month. Then we'll really be interested for a month before they

709
01:11:20.48 --> 01:11:26.08
really move on. It's like, all right, a month, okay, month the marathon's and longest month is 31.

710
01:11:26.72 --> 01:11:34.24
So, I picked 31. And I have to say, when you know you're doing, you know what you're doing is hard

711
01:11:34.24 --> 01:11:39.68
when you come on Jocco podcast. And he says, this is insane. Jocco willing, so something isn't saying,

712
01:11:39.68 --> 01:11:45.76
you know, it's the right level of intensity. So, what kind of miles did you put into, get ready for it?

713
01:11:45.76 --> 01:11:53.44
And how long did you train for it? Um, my total I trained about 18 months for this specifically.

714
01:11:53.44 --> 01:11:59.84
And I say that knowing that I had been an athlete training just about twice a day every day for

715
01:12:01.28 --> 01:12:06.80
five years at the time. So, I had that huge history of being an athlete to begin with. And then on

716
01:12:06.80 --> 01:12:12.56
top of that, I put the 18 months of training specifically for this. And so, the way it would work would be

717
01:12:12.56 --> 01:12:22.40
I would run, I would do six weeks, a six week block where I was applying a certain stress.

718
01:12:23.28 --> 01:12:28.56
And so, my first six week block would be, I was basically just working on getting long distance

719
01:12:28.56 --> 01:12:34.48
because when I was running triathlons, I only ever did, you know, five K max. So, I was I would run an

720
01:12:34.48 --> 01:12:40.64
hour, I probably run three times a week, um, be an hour, 90 minutes, another hour and they'd be spaced

721
01:12:40.64 --> 01:12:46.48
out back a couple days. So, I do six weeks of that. And then I would do a little test block.

722
01:12:46.48 --> 01:12:51.28
And my first test block was running the Marine Corps marathon again. So, it was one marathon.

723
01:12:51.28 --> 01:12:57.04
And then I'd do another six week chunk where I would change the stress and make it a little bit harder.

724
01:12:57.04 --> 01:13:02.08
So, I would do, I would either run a little bit longer, um, on my really long run for the week,

725
01:13:02.08 --> 01:13:06.96
or I would block them together, maybe like run an hour and a half Wednesday and then run an

726
01:13:06.96 --> 01:13:13.60
hour Thursday. Kind of change up the blocking. And after that six weeks, I would do again,

727
01:13:13.60 --> 01:13:18.16
and I would do two marathon. And the first time I attempted to do marathon is actually failed.

728
01:13:18.16 --> 01:13:23.60
I couldn't, I ran the first one the next day. I ran maybe half marathon and I quit. I was like,

729
01:13:23.60 --> 01:13:27.44
I had you already said you're going to run 31 marathon. Yeah, at this point. Yeah.

730
01:13:27.44 --> 01:13:31.12
That's reassuring. Yeah. So, I was like, all right. But I kind of knew,

731
01:13:31.12 --> 01:13:37.76
I, 31 or two. I like to. Oh, I told my friends, I was like, yeah, I tried to run two and I didn't.

732
01:13:37.76 --> 01:13:42.88
They were like, but I, what was it, what was the failure based on?

733
01:13:42.88 --> 01:13:49.92
Um, I didn't need enough the day before. So, the, part of the reason I was doing these test blocks

734
01:13:49.92 --> 01:13:54.56
was figuring out, first of all, pacing, you know, good way different ways to pace it.

735
01:13:54.56 --> 01:13:59.52
So, make sure I didn't blow up and then figuring out how much I needed to eat.

736
01:13:59.52 --> 01:14:05.92
And figuring out, you know, what it was going to feel like. And so that first time I attempted to,

737
01:14:05.92 --> 01:14:11.84
I didn't need enough carbs of the day, you know, after that first marathon. So, I was just totally

738
01:14:11.84 --> 01:14:18.56
depleted the next day. So, I was like, okay, I didn't, it wasn't a lack of willpower or lack of

739
01:14:19.12 --> 01:14:26.32
kind of ability at that time. It was just my approach at that time wasn't, uh, wasn't right. So, I was like,

740
01:14:26.32 --> 01:14:30.56
okay, I didn't really panic about that because I knew, I kind of knew what happened.

741
01:14:31.52 --> 01:14:37.76
And so, all right. And so, I go and then I do six, and I kind of just repeated that for the year and a half,

742
01:14:37.76 --> 01:14:43.12
where six week chunk and I just changed it, block them together a little bit more, run longer.

743
01:14:43.76 --> 01:14:48.96
And then I tried three marathon and I succeeded and it was pretty easy. I'm not easy, but, you know,

744
01:14:48.96 --> 01:14:54.40
it's, I was like, all right, three. Yeah, it's feasible. I three, yeah, I don't feel that bad, you know.

745
01:14:54.40 --> 01:15:01.60
And then I did another six week and changed the stress again, longer and block together more. I ran five.

746
01:15:02.64 --> 01:15:06.88
And I was like, all right, five. Okay. And I would mess around with a different,

747
01:15:08.80 --> 01:15:14.48
different pacing strategies, different ways of breaking up the, each marathon, taking breaks and that kind of thing.

748
01:15:15.20 --> 01:15:22.48
And eating different foods just to see how all that I would react to that. And then after five,

749
01:15:22.48 --> 01:15:26.56
I was like, you know what, I'm going to, I'm not going to do any more than five because if I do more than five,

750
01:15:26.56 --> 01:15:31.76
I'm just going to want to keep going. I don't really want to. So five is enough. I felt really good after five.

751
01:15:32.80 --> 01:15:38.48
And then after that, I just kind of trained through for maybe three more months. But I kept every six

752
01:15:38.48 --> 01:15:44.96
weeks. I kept adding more mileage. And so, the last 12 weeks, I was running a marathon every Thursday.

753
01:15:45.76 --> 01:15:50.000
And how many total miles were you putting in a week?

754
01:15:50.000 --> 01:16:01.28
And that last 12 weeks, probably 60, like my, you know how they say a deadlift starts at 135 pounds, you know,

755
01:16:01.84 --> 01:16:07.12
like my runs would start at two hours. I wouldn't do anything less than two hours. And then yeah,

756
01:16:07.12 --> 01:16:10.96
I would do that marathon on Thursday. And I would run two hours the day before and two hours the day after.

757
01:16:11.68 --> 01:16:18.16
And the reason I was doing that was to get this run a marathon so many times leading up to it that

758
01:16:18.16 --> 01:16:22.88
the thought of running one marathon isn't really, it's just normal. It became normal to me.

759
01:16:23.76 --> 01:16:29.44
And so I was trying to get that. I wanted to take you of running to run a marathon at the pace at your

760
01:16:29.44 --> 01:16:36.48
sustained 31 day pace at my sustained. It was interesting. So we run in like eight minute miles,

761
01:16:37.04 --> 01:16:44.24
nine minute miles. Usually it would be between eight 30 and nine minute miles. And it was interesting because

762
01:16:44.24 --> 01:16:52.48
in the summertime, I was running like a four and a half hour marathon of total running time. And so all the

763
01:16:52.48 --> 01:16:57.12
predictions I put on my website were like, oh, I'm probably going to finish in about this amount of time.

764
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.76
But that was during the hot and humid summer in Virginia,

765
01:17:02.72 --> 01:17:06.88
whereas when I was doing this, it was in the fall time. So I was actually able to run faster. And people would

766
01:17:06.88 --> 01:17:14.16
come out and say, what the heck, you said you could be running like nine, ten minute miles,

767
01:17:14.16 --> 01:17:19.76
the New York run in eight 30s or eight or nine minutes. And it was kind of, it was what also is interesting was,

768
01:17:20.88 --> 01:17:27.52
I figured my first marathon would be, I'd be fresh. And I'd be my fastest marathon.

769
01:17:28.08 --> 01:17:33.36
And so that was in London. It was about four hours, roughly, of running time with breaks. I would take

770
01:17:33.36 --> 01:17:39.92
three 20 minute breaks. Four hours of running time. And then it kind of did follow that trajectory where

771
01:17:39.92 --> 01:17:47.20
Philadelphia, New York and Boston were a little bit slower, like four, five, four, 15,

772
01:17:47.20 --> 01:17:50.88
somewhere in there. And then after I got there, I actually started getting faster.

773
01:17:51.92 --> 01:17:57.68
So the next all the way into Chicago, my fastest one was my tenth one in Chicago was 350.

774
01:17:58.56 --> 01:18:03.52
And of running time. And then after that, it kind of just level off. And I'd usually be going somewhere

775
01:18:03.52 --> 01:18:09.12
between 350 and four hours. The human body is amazing. Yeah. And all this stuff that I've been

776
01:18:09.12 --> 01:18:14.56
able to adapt to. And even I still wasn't able to predict that I would actually get faster.

777
01:18:14.56 --> 01:18:21.28
I didn't expect that. And so I mean, this goes to show you that the body can adapt to even more than you think.

778
01:18:21.60 --> 01:18:26.80
What are the biggest challenges of regular running and running with prosthetics on?

779
01:18:28.32 --> 01:18:36.000
So yeah, one of the things I had to figure out was one of the things I learned and the my first

780
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.16
and second Marine Corps marathon was that I needed to figure out how I was going to prevent

781
01:18:40.16 --> 01:18:47.76
skin breakdown. So prevent, I would run after my first marathon. I ran and then I took my legs off.

782
01:18:48.72 --> 01:18:55.52
And it was just blood. I'd take the liner off and just blood to shot everywhere. And it wasn't all

783
01:18:55.52 --> 01:19:00.56
blood, but it was like kind of blood mixed with sweat. Right. It was like, oh my god, what I do to myself

784
01:19:00.56 --> 01:19:06.24
did I was I was scared. I was like, did I mess up my skin graft? Is that thing? Because those things can be

785
01:19:06.24 --> 01:19:12.72
kind of sensitive. And it ended up just being a little blister like or a little I've rubbed the skin off.

786
01:19:12.72 --> 01:19:17.92
And it's like the size of that big. But I knew if I did that ran again the next day,

787
01:19:17.92 --> 01:19:22.32
that's going to get bigger and that's going to totally derail all things. I had to figure out a way that

788
01:19:22.32 --> 01:19:31.44
I could avoid getting my skin rubbing off. And so I started to mess around. I wear these things called

789
01:19:31.44 --> 01:19:37.44
liner liners that kind of wick the sweat. They kind of collect the sweat to help with claminess.

790
01:19:38.16 --> 01:19:41.92
And so usually I put those on and they would go all the way around the end of my stump and be like a

791
01:19:41.92 --> 01:19:46.96
sock on the end. So what I did was I cut that off at the end. And so it's kind of basically

792
01:19:46.96 --> 01:19:50.64
like a kind of like a rash guard on my thigh and it wouldn't go down to the end of the stump.

793
01:19:50.64 --> 01:19:55.92
So I cut that off. Why do you want it to go down to the end? So what my theory was, it's kind of

794
01:19:55.92 --> 01:20:00.64
a cloth. It's a cloth material. So what I figured was in the liner itself is a silicone.

795
01:20:01.28 --> 01:20:06.24
And I didn't figure that the silicone would be creating a lot of friction. So what I figured was

796
01:20:06.88 --> 01:20:13.20
maybe that little liner liner, you know, as comfortable as it was, it was still fabric. So it was

797
01:20:13.20 --> 01:20:19.76
probably just 40,000 steps. Still rubbing the skin off. So I alright. So I'll cut that off and see what happens.

798
01:20:19.76 --> 01:20:24.48
And that was good. But it still didn't fix everything. So what I ended up doing was I, you know,

799
01:20:24.48 --> 01:20:30.08
for my cycling experience, I'd use chamy cream on my on your butt, you know, to help prevent

800
01:20:30.08 --> 01:20:36.56
saddle source. It's like, well, maybe I'll take the chamy cream and put it on the spots that I know

801
01:20:36.80 --> 01:20:42.32
tend to get rub. So I would go up. I would just take a huge goop and just slather it on there.

802
01:20:43.04 --> 01:20:48.72
And and that seemed to fit that fixed. It pretty good. And so I was like, alright. So I figured that

803
01:20:48.72 --> 01:20:52.80
method out. So that's one of the things is trying to figure it with running with prosthetics is

804
01:20:53.60 --> 01:21:01.84
figuring out how to avoid that skin breakdown. And that's kind of new ruin because that can,

805
01:21:01.84 --> 01:21:05.84
I mean, you can be as strong as you want, but if you're skin, if you can't put your leg on because the

806
01:21:05.84 --> 01:21:10.40
skin hurts so much, then all that strength, it doesn't doesn't matter.

807
01:21:11.52 --> 01:21:15.68
So so what did you do with your diet? Well, you just pound calories. I mean, just eating everything

808
01:21:15.68 --> 01:21:20.48
inside. Yeah. So I approached my diet a little bit differently than most you might expect for

809
01:21:20.48 --> 01:21:27.84
marathons. I did a low carb diet. Well, what would be a low carb for this kind of thing? So I was

810
01:21:27.84 --> 01:21:32.08
using this, and all my training and all my pacing and all my eating. I did this thing called the

811
01:21:32.08 --> 01:21:40.08
Maphatone method. And it's basically this guy fell Maphatone figured that you should do all your

812
01:21:40.08 --> 01:21:47.20
training at an aerobic level. So he figured out this through experience he calculated your, he came

813
01:21:47.20 --> 01:21:53.12
over the equation to calculate your maximum aerobic heart rate was 180 minus your age. And then there's

814
01:21:53.12 --> 01:22:01.76
other little adjustments you can make to that. So my Maphatone heart rate was 149. And so I had never

815
01:22:01.76 --> 01:22:07.52
in anything over 149. So you're on a heart rate monitor all the time? Yeah, I had a Tom Tom watch

816
01:22:07.52 --> 01:22:13.20
and I had one of them. My wife has one. So I had two on when I was one of my marathons. Just in case

817
01:22:13.20 --> 01:22:20.48
one messed up. And so I ran all my all my training and all my marathons were run at as close to that

818
01:22:20.48 --> 01:22:28.08
149 heart rate. And what it does is trains instead of like making you strong, you're muscle stronger.

819
01:22:28.08 --> 01:22:34.72
It actually trains your cardiovascular efficiency. So when you start out, you'll be running at 149

820
01:22:34.72 --> 01:22:41.68
heart rate and you'll be pretty slow. But as you do that more, your heart and lungs will become more

821
01:22:41.68 --> 01:22:47.68
and more efficient. So eventually you'll be running at that same 149 heart rate, but you'll be

822
01:22:47.68 --> 01:22:53.20
running twice as fast because you become a more efficient. So I just approached it like that.

823
01:22:53.20 --> 01:22:59.36
And I kind of figured to be better to do it that way because the more glycolysis and the more

824
01:22:59.36 --> 01:23:05.68
carbonyl hydrate you use, the more your body is going to have to, they're more destructive to your body.

825
01:23:06.48 --> 01:23:10.80
So I'm like, well, in order to be able to run these, I have to run them at a maintainable pace

826
01:23:10.80 --> 01:23:17.44
in a maintainable way. I can't just go out and run as fast as I can every single one. I had to

827
01:23:17.44 --> 01:23:23.20
pace it. And so I figured that's how I was going to pace it. Keeping my heart rate under 150

828
01:23:23.20 --> 01:23:30.16
not using those carbs. And so that also allowed me to be able to eat just really high fat.

829
01:23:31.36 --> 01:23:38.64
I think I had between 150 and 175 grams of carbs a day. And that's what I limited it to. And then I would eat

830
01:23:41.60 --> 01:23:46.40
during the run, I would eat three bunk breaker bars. I wanted each of my breaks.

831
01:23:47.84 --> 01:23:52.08
And they're just like these little energy bars. And that would keep me going. There would be

832
01:23:52.08 --> 01:23:55.20
my kind of a lot of carbs there. So that would kind of keep me going during the run.

833
01:23:55.20 --> 01:24:02.80
I would just drink water whenever I got thirsty. And then after I ran, we had pre-made these,

834
01:24:02.80 --> 01:24:09.60
me, pre-made all my meals. And we just made this super calorie dense cheese and meat sauce

835
01:24:10.16 --> 01:24:15.12
that we froze. We put it on the freezer. And it was just the densest, you know, the

836
01:24:15.12 --> 01:24:22.24
calorie dense stuff you could probably like, you know, can to whole containers and cream and cheese

837
01:24:22.24 --> 01:24:29.92
and all this stuff. So super dense. And my mom would heat up a bowl of that for me. And I would take

838
01:24:29.92 --> 01:24:35.28
a bag of pork rinds and put that in the chili and mix that in there and get the whole thing.

839
01:24:36.16 --> 01:24:40.96
And before a lot of the times before I even ran, I would eat another bag of pork cracklings.

840
01:24:40.96 --> 01:24:46.40
So I'd have two bags of pork rinds, this big ass bowl of meat sauce and cheese sauce.

841
01:24:47.44 --> 01:24:52.80
And then I would eat some sweet potato chips, things like that. If somebody brought us donuts,

842
01:24:52.80 --> 01:24:58.000
I'd have a donut, you know. We have issues around.

843
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.64
I would eat pork rinds, good donuts. People, as people could see what just happened to

844
01:25:02.64 --> 01:25:06.24
Jocca was hiding on a Saturday donut. Thought it was going to come across.

845
01:25:06.24 --> 01:25:12.16
Um, so I eat that and then at the for dinner, I eat eggs and bacon.

846
01:25:13.04 --> 01:25:18.000
And the whole time you're, you got an RV because you did this in 31 different cities.

847
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.52
Yeah. You started off in London. I then flew back to America and then started the grind

848
01:25:23.52 --> 01:25:30.96
New York, Chicago, just going around the country. And you your wife and a little support team

849
01:25:30.96 --> 01:25:36.08
was in the RV. Yep. So it was for us. It was a Pam. What kind of RV did you have?

850
01:25:37.92 --> 01:25:42.16
Coach, Min Marotta, I think. Get some. It's like a 35. Do you have a RV? I do.

851
01:25:42.16 --> 01:25:46.80
You're going to 30, you're going to 35 foot or no? Yeah, it was a class A 35 foot,

852
01:25:46.80 --> 01:25:50.80
King size bed in the back. Oh, yeah, that's nice. Um, don't you sleep good in RVs?

853
01:25:51.36 --> 01:25:57.04
I don't know, it's not moving. I don't know why. I sleep like a baby in RVs. I slept well, but it's

854
01:25:57.04 --> 01:26:02.24
not totally comfortable when you're driving down the highway at 60. Yeah. It's pretty bouncy back there.

855
01:26:02.24 --> 01:26:07.76
I mean, it made it. This is something I didn't expect. It was it made it kind of hard to eat,

856
01:26:07.76 --> 01:26:13.20
be in in the back. So I'd have to eat all this stuff. And by that's being in the back of that RV for

857
01:26:13.20 --> 01:26:20.40
five, six hours. I was starting to get a little bit. Yeah, it's a lot more bouncy than being in the front.

858
01:26:20.40 --> 01:26:25.36
Oh, yeah, big time. That's a big deal. That's a lot. The axle and there's so much weight. Yeah. So be Pam,

859
01:26:25.36 --> 01:26:35.84
my wife, team leader. She drove some. She drove a lot. I wasn't even, I wasn't really in charge of the

860
01:26:36.40 --> 01:26:42.88
years. The day to day. Yeah, my job. Yeah, exactly. Well, run when I needed to run, when I need to do interviews,

861
01:26:42.88 --> 01:26:49.04
run my mouth. Oh, no, do that. And then that was it pretty much. And then put Pam, she was doing

862
01:26:49.04 --> 01:26:56.16
everything, you know, driving, setting up scheduling all my interviews, working with these reporters.

863
01:26:56.16 --> 01:27:01.04
And I'm like, oh, we want to do this at 630. Can we make that happen? She's scheduled in. And then

864
01:27:01.76 --> 01:27:06.88
calling ahead to the venues that we had decided to run at, you know, square in that away. Oh,

865
01:27:06.88 --> 01:27:11.44
okay, where can we park? We're coming now. And there's probably so many other jobs that I didn't even

866
01:27:11.44 --> 01:27:17.84
know about that she was doing. And then, you know, it's taken on a boatload of stress for her.

867
01:27:17.84 --> 01:27:25.76
And then my mom would she be kind of Pam's assistant. She'd be a charge of kind of keeping me

868
01:27:25.76 --> 01:27:31.04
fed and hydrated during when I was running, making try to need anything. And then afterwards,

869
01:27:31.04 --> 01:27:36.08
she would make my meals. And then one of her most important jobs was she's a massage therapist.

870
01:27:36.08 --> 01:27:42.64
So she'd give me two massage every day after I ran while we were driving to the next place. And then I also had a

871
01:27:42.64 --> 01:27:50.24
driver who did most of the driving. And then he, he just kind of helped out around the,

872
01:27:50.96 --> 01:27:56.08
the RV, like whatever Pam needed him to do something, he would do it. What kind of people joined you

873
01:27:56.08 --> 01:28:00.48
on the runs? I know you said you were telling me yesterday some some rail Marines in England.

874
01:28:00.48 --> 01:28:03.92
Oh, yeah. I joined you. That's got it out there. I mean tons of military.

875
01:28:06.08 --> 01:28:11.28
If I had to categorize, I mean, it just people people from all walks alive. You know,

876
01:28:11.28 --> 01:28:15.68
ultra runners would find out about it and people that ran, people that didn't even run would come out.

877
01:28:16.72 --> 01:28:23.12
A lot of military. I would say 50% of the people, though, that came out. I would say,

878
01:28:23.12 --> 01:28:28.96
how to hear about this. They say Jocco Park. I'm no bullshit. At least 50% of them.

879
01:28:28.96 --> 01:28:33.44
That's killer. The troopers are not played around. Yeah. No. They're to support.

880
01:28:34.08 --> 01:28:40.72
You're doing major support. And then, uh, yes, there would be a lot of milit, a lot of guys that I deployed with,

881
01:28:40.72 --> 01:28:45.28
came out and supported a lot of cops, a lot of fire departments. But you know, it's,

882
01:28:45.28 --> 01:28:51.20
there really wasn't one net to just, even kids would come out. Yeah, kids would come out.

883
01:28:51.20 --> 01:28:54.72
People with their parents, a full families would come out for the day and run.

884
01:28:55.84 --> 01:29:03.84
It was also my kids that ran their first ever marathon with me. Yeah. It's awesome. And a lot of

885
01:29:03.84 --> 01:29:07.12
people would just, they'd be running their first marathon. And then I had to wait the lady sees like,

886
01:29:07.12 --> 01:29:11.28
well, I'm running a marathon next week, but I'm going to run one with you. And she PB, you know,

887
01:29:11.28 --> 01:29:16.000
and so it would be all sorts of people I'd come out of the RV in the morning and there just be

888
01:29:16.56 --> 01:29:21.68
people that have been waiting there for me to come out and no matter what. And it didn't matter.

889
01:29:21.68 --> 01:29:24.48
Time in the morning where you start running. I would usually start around seven.

890
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.48
Unless I had some kind of big interview, like I had a fox in friends interview when I was in

891
01:29:30.48 --> 01:29:36.32
New York. So I started at 7 30 or 8. But I would try and be pretty religious about starting at 7.

892
01:29:37.04 --> 01:29:42.64
And then people would be out there. It didn't matter if it was 20 degrees in Denver.

893
01:29:43.20 --> 01:29:48.32
They'd be out there. If it was raining, they'd be out there. You know, it was awesome.

894
01:29:48.88 --> 01:29:56.16
That is awesome. What was the, what was the hardest part or did you meet any hard parts during the,

895
01:29:56.16 --> 01:30:00.000
during the trip? I was there. And actually, I remember when you were getting ready to go.

896
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:06.96
Yeah. This is pretty cool. I'm like, hey, man, like, what if, you know, what if you're not going to make it?

897
01:30:06.96 --> 01:30:11.36
Like, what if you can't. And what I was actually thinking about, I was thinking about your legs. And,

898
01:30:11.36 --> 01:30:17.44
and I know that, I mean, I've got other friends that have prosthetics. And I know that it's a,

899
01:30:17.44 --> 01:30:22.32
that it's a grind and it rips your skin apart. And I was kind of thinking, that's what I was thinking.

900
01:30:22.32 --> 01:30:25.84
I wasn't thinking, like, oh, you were going to get tired and quit. But I was thinking that they're,

901
01:30:25.84 --> 01:30:30.40
there might come a point where you physically weren't going to be able to do this without, you know,

902
01:30:30.40 --> 01:30:36.88
causing massive damage to your body. Yeah. And possibly, you know, getting infections and everything else.

903
01:30:37.60 --> 01:30:40.64
And I said, you know, what if, you know, what if something happens and you're like, no, I'm going to,

904
01:30:41.36 --> 01:30:44.64
I'm going to finish it. Is that okay? Well, there you have it. Yeah. Well, you know, that was

905
01:30:44.64 --> 01:30:49.52
some I was concerned about too. I didn't know how my body was going to react to it. And

906
01:30:49.52 --> 01:30:57.68
I didn't know for sure, I never knew even up to the last one. Last mile of the last one,

907
01:30:57.68 --> 01:31:03.52
I, I would never have say, I'm definitely going to finish this because, you know, anything can happen.

908
01:31:03.52 --> 01:31:09.36
So I could have my prosthetic on twisted a little bit and then that rub's off skin on my skin

909
01:31:09.36 --> 01:31:14.72
graft and then that causes it to die or something. And I'm screwed. And then I had, I can't, you know,

910
01:31:14.72 --> 01:31:22.72
I can't continue. So I never knew for sure, but I, I, I believed that as long as everything kind of went

911
01:31:22.72 --> 01:31:30.40
according to plan, then it was possible as long as no catastrophic events happened. And I was feeling

912
01:31:30.40 --> 01:31:35.76
confident. I was very confident the whole time. And then I got all the way around to Texas.

913
01:31:37.28 --> 01:31:42.80
And I had been really lucky with the weather all the way around. We got to Texas and we're hitting a

914
01:31:42.80 --> 01:31:49.52
heat wave in Texas. And it was probably, I woke up in the morning in in a, in Houston,

915
01:31:50.72 --> 01:31:55.76
sweating all right to sweating already. It was ridiculous. I was just covered in sweat,

916
01:31:55.76 --> 01:32:02.000
waking up in Houston. It was like 100% humidity, probably like 75, 80 degrees, just to start the day.

917
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:08.48
Houston gets some. Oh my god. And heat gets to me pretty easily. It's, it's the one thing

918
01:32:08.48 --> 01:32:16.24
that could really slow me down. But I came out of that RV. And there were, and the heat,

919
01:32:16.24 --> 01:32:20.96
the heat can get to you because you, you basically are missing a couple radiators. Oh yeah.

920
01:32:20.96 --> 01:32:26.48
I mean, because your, your body, everyone's body gives off a lot of heat through their legs.

921
01:32:26.48 --> 01:32:32.24
And you don't have those radiators to give off heat anymore. So you, you, you can overheat fairly

922
01:32:32.24 --> 01:32:39.36
quickly. Exactly. Um, yeah. Then my, my, so in addition not having the radiators, my legs are

923
01:32:39.36 --> 01:32:47.68
encased in carbon fiber. So it's actually bottling in the heat on my legs instead. So it can really slow

924
01:32:47.68 --> 01:32:58.64
me down. But I came out of that RV in Houston. And there was just 70 people there waiting for me to run.

925
01:32:58.64 --> 01:33:04.000
And a lot of more Marines, there's a local Marine recruiting office that came out and they brought

926
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.08
their pulleys. People that were about to go to boot camp. Awesome. And they brought them out. And I'm like,

927
01:33:08.88 --> 01:33:12.96
well, it doesn't matter. You know, I, I'm going, I'm going, I, even if they weren't there,

928
01:33:12.96 --> 01:33:16.72
I still would have ran it. But I'm like, man, look at all these people that want to run with me.

929
01:33:16.72 --> 01:33:21.04
And so I just did it. And then it just, it took a long, I think that was probably my longest.

930
01:33:22.96 --> 01:33:27.52
It was probably four and a half hours of running. And that was a guy in its regular wheelchair that

931
01:33:27.52 --> 01:33:33.92
did it with me the whole time. Just Berlin and his wheelchair by me. So that was a really tough

932
01:33:33.92 --> 01:33:38.64
date. So that San Antonio Houston Dallas were all really hot, really human. And I had to do them

933
01:33:38.64 --> 01:33:43.84
back to back to back to back. But I got through it because people came out and ran with me and kept me going.

934
01:33:43.84 --> 01:33:52.80
And then in Nashville, I, it had been raining that day. And I was running on a trail. And there

935
01:33:52.80 --> 01:33:59.12
are these wooden bridges over these little brick creeks. And I had run on wooden bridges before.

936
01:33:59.12 --> 01:34:02.56
So I knew they were going to be slippery. And I was like, are I going to take it slow over this?

937
01:34:02.56 --> 01:34:09.52
And I still I slipped on this bridge. And injured my back. Yeah. Not at the time. I didn't feel

938
01:34:09.52 --> 01:34:14.16
like I injured at the time. I was like, hmm, this is kind of a hard fall. And I kept running.

939
01:34:14.16 --> 01:34:19.92
But the next day when I woke up in Atlanta, my back was killing me. And I had four left.

940
01:34:19.92 --> 01:34:27.44
And I just had to gut it out. You know, every time I landed on my right foot, it was like kind of

941
01:34:27.44 --> 01:34:34.96
shot a bad pain into my, into my middle back. And there's a little bit frustrating because I was like,

942
01:34:35.84 --> 01:34:41.68
I was feeling so good up to that point. And I had run a super fast marathon in Memphis.

943
01:34:42.88 --> 01:34:46.72
I was feeling so good. I was like, oh man, I'm going to be able to really enjoy these last four,

944
01:34:46.72 --> 01:34:50.56
you know, and then you know, the universe is like, nope, you're going to have to earn it. Sorry.

945
01:34:51.76 --> 01:34:52.72
You're going to have to earn it.

946
01:34:53.76 --> 01:35:01.12
You'll recruit these last four. And then you finished up on Veterans Day. Yeah. In in DC. In DC Veterans Day.

947
01:35:03.44 --> 01:35:07.60
And my back was feeling a little bit better at this point, but still hurt and pretty bad.

948
01:35:08.32 --> 01:35:15.92
And it was interesting because all up to that point, my my stumps were feeling pretty good. They had.

949
01:35:15.92 --> 01:35:21.12
I started to get these little pockets of fluid on the kind of the outer corner of both of them.

950
01:35:21.68 --> 01:35:27.92
And they hurt when I pushed on them. And then usually for the first mile, they would hurt pretty bad.

951
01:35:28.48 --> 01:35:34.16
And it got to point my mom had this like kind of icy hot spray. She was spraying that on the end

952
01:35:34.16 --> 01:35:40.000
every day to help. And so, but after the first mile, that pain would kind of go away.

953
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.40
I would just pound them into submission or whatever. And they would be like, all right, you're going to

954
01:35:44.40 --> 01:35:46.72
keep going. We're just going to turn ourselves off or whatever.

955
01:35:49.12 --> 01:35:53.20
So after the first mile, I'd be good. And they wouldn't really hurt a much more into the next step.

956
01:35:53.20 --> 01:35:54.40
This is a knucklehead. Yeah.

957
01:35:56.40 --> 01:35:58.56
He hears us. He hears us. He's going to keep doing it.

958
01:36:00.56 --> 01:36:06.56
And yeah, so after the first mile would be, they'd be fine. But that last day in Washington, DC,

959
01:36:06.56 --> 01:36:11.12
they just never turned off. And I think maybe it was because there's that same thing where

960
01:36:11.12 --> 01:36:17.60
I knew this was the last one. And my body kind of knew it was the last one. So it was starting to maybe

961
01:36:17.60 --> 01:36:22.40
let itself, and it had held on to that last one. And maybe it was starting to let itself on gravel a little bit.

962
01:36:23.04 --> 01:36:27.12
And so that whole last day was just pain in the back.

963
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.56
Freezing coal. It was like 20 degrees out. And so every time I stopped to rest, I was sweating. I was like,

964
01:36:34.56 --> 01:36:40.08
you know, I had a hot water bottle. I was all snuggled up with and I would still be like cold.

965
01:36:40.08 --> 01:36:44.72
But just the sheer number of people out there. I'd never, what I,

966
01:36:46.16 --> 01:36:49.76
there was never less than a hundred people running with me than an entire day. It's awesome.

967
01:36:49.76 --> 01:36:55.04
And I had, there was people there that had run with me. And other cities that came

968
01:36:55.84 --> 01:37:01.92
and came for the last one. I had brothers with me that had deployed to Afghanistan. All there running with me.

969
01:37:01.92 --> 01:37:13.60
I had, for my last mile, I had, uh, there was a general running. It was out in front. So we

970
01:37:13.60 --> 01:37:17.52
running around the national mall, my last mile around the reflecting pools. It's about a mile.

971
01:37:18.08 --> 01:37:23.20
And so there was a general out front. Like clear the way. Because clear people out of the way.

972
01:37:23.20 --> 01:37:27.28
You know, and then there was a sergeant major who had been my company first sergeant.

973
01:37:27.28 --> 01:37:31.36
A grith, so they were running like, side by side. Like, get out of the way.

974
01:37:32.16 --> 01:37:33.84
No politely telling people to get out of the way.

975
01:37:35.84 --> 01:37:42.48
Sergeant major Kent retired a sergeant major of the Marine Corps. Top, a sergeant major in the Marine Corps.

976
01:37:42.48 --> 01:37:47.52
It was running with me that last, uh, maybe 12k singing cases. You know,

977
01:37:49.68 --> 01:37:54.000
there was, you know, I just had, I had brothers with me that were in the group.

978
01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.04
Uh, their kids, you know, uh, Pam joined me for that last mile. My mom joined me. I had family in there

979
01:38:01.04 --> 01:38:05.92
for the last mile. And before we started that last mile, I'd like gear. I promised I was like,

980
01:38:05.92 --> 01:38:09.68
I've already everybody. I'm going to take this last mile real slow just so that we can,

981
01:38:10.48 --> 01:38:14.000
everybody can stay together. And then by the end of, I was like sprinting by.

982
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:23.04
Just so pumped up, you know, to be finished. But man, it was so cool. And I, uh, finished that last little

983
01:38:23.04 --> 01:38:30.40
loop. And I kind of like ran up. There's this little curved sidewalk that goes up to the Lincoln Memorial.

984
01:38:30.40 --> 01:38:35.28
And so I finished that last mile. I kind of curve it up to that last and the whole sidewalk

985
01:38:35.28 --> 01:38:40.64
was lined with folks. And then they had set up a little, uh, finished line for me up there.

986
01:38:40.64 --> 01:38:44.08
And the whole thing was just lined with people. Like, yeah, you know. And, uh,

987
01:38:44.08 --> 01:38:51.92
uh, cross a finish line. Pam was there. You know, we celebrated she cried. I did not cry.

988
01:38:53.76 --> 01:39:00.88
Um, to make that clear right now. Um, finished, you know, kissed her hug tur and then the

989
01:39:00.88 --> 01:39:08.64
reporters kind of came and started a talk. Awesome. And, uh, you raised money. Yeah.

990
01:39:08.64 --> 01:39:15.28
You raised money. A bunch of money for, you know, you support a bunch of foundations. So that was awesome, too.

991
01:39:15.28 --> 01:39:20.96
Yeah. That was sort of the other driving force behind you doing it. Besides, just you're crazy. But

992
01:39:20.96 --> 01:39:26.16
also if you were raising money for a bunch of good causes. Yeah. You know, raising money. We raised 200,000

993
01:39:27.04 --> 01:39:32.16
at the time I finished. I kind of, I stopped team track, but it's probably like 215 now or something like that.

994
01:39:32.16 --> 01:39:38.72
Uh, for December 5 on tunnel to tower's foundation, coalition to Sudamacas heroes. And that was kind of,

995
01:39:41.12 --> 01:39:50.32
that was, that was kind of how I almost, um, manifested, physically manifested. How successful it was.

996
01:39:51.36 --> 01:39:57.44
So why, what I was trying to do is just create that, create a story that people could feed off of.

997
01:39:57.44 --> 01:40:06.80
And so when you, when you look at all the stories that are out there about veterans coming back,

998
01:40:08.40 --> 01:40:15.36
the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of stories are the post-traumatic stress story. Every movie

999
01:40:15.36 --> 01:40:21.92
that comes out that is about of, oh, I have, oh, we have veteran coming home is this pretty much the same,

1000
01:40:21.92 --> 01:40:31.52
uh, same recipe. Veteran goes overseas, they experience war, they see some bad stuff like you do

1001
01:40:31.52 --> 01:40:38.72
in war, they come back and they're a basket case and they implode and they implode their family and

1002
01:40:38.72 --> 01:40:45.76
all this stuff. And that's again, that's a hugely important story too, no, because it does happen.

1003
01:40:45.76 --> 01:40:51.76
And it's, we have to take care of those guys and we have to make sure we keep that story in our

1004
01:40:51.76 --> 01:40:57.28
in the forefront of our minds. But what started to bother me was that was the only story that was

1005
01:40:57.28 --> 01:41:04.32
getting told. And I think general Madda said it best when he answered the question somewhere and he said,

1006
01:41:04.32 --> 01:41:09.12
you know, expectations are very strong. So if you, if you go overseas and everybody's kind of

1007
01:41:09.12 --> 01:41:17.28
expecting you to, uh, basically have PTSD, then there's a good chance that you're going to

1008
01:41:17.28 --> 01:41:23.36
manifest that in yourself. Just by do it by virtue of the fact that that's what's expected. And so

1009
01:41:23.36 --> 01:41:28.72
you're just going to create that. Yeah. Um, and so what I wanted to do is get this story out there,

1010
01:41:28.72 --> 01:41:35.68
tell a story where there was a guy that went overseas, had a traumatic experience and came back

1011
01:41:35.68 --> 01:41:42.72
and was better than he was before. And so that was how I determined that was going to create this

1012
01:41:42.72 --> 01:41:47.68
story. And you know, I felt that I knew that this was a problem that this story wasn't getting out there.

1013
01:41:47.68 --> 01:41:53.76
And no, so I felt the responsibility to create it myself. You know, if it's not out there,

1014
01:41:53.76 --> 01:41:58.40
it's like what I was saying to that I can't, uh, journal. No, I had that responsibility because it

1015
01:41:58.40 --> 01:42:03.28
just wasn't out there very much. And so I set out to create that story and then, you know, so if

1016
01:42:05.04 --> 01:42:10.64
if there was a guy that was struggling, um, he could see that story and then he could see, you know,

1017
01:42:10.64 --> 01:42:17.04
what it actually is possible to go see war and come back and be fine and or not be necessarily be totally

1018
01:42:17.04 --> 01:42:23.44
fine. But uh, overcome it and find your new path and find your new mission and continue on,

1019
01:42:23.44 --> 01:42:29.28
keep fighting for veterans, keep fighting for your brothers. And if they, if there's a guy that's

1020
01:42:29.28 --> 01:42:34.24
coming home and he's kind of on the fence, he sees that story and maybe takes him the the right way

1021
01:42:34.24 --> 01:42:40.32
and then at the same time getting it out there for civilians. Uh, there's a major military

1022
01:42:40.32 --> 01:42:47.36
civilian gap of understanding, because military tend to be isolated and on the bases. And, you know,

1023
01:42:47.36 --> 01:42:53.20
that the, I could see that gap because of all these movies that were coming out. There's

1024
01:42:54.24 --> 01:43:00.96
every, like 100% of movies that came out were the main character at PTSD, whereas you look at

1025
01:43:00.96 --> 01:43:08.40
the statistics and it's 25% of non-combat troops have what we'll call PTSD, 7% of

1026
01:43:08.40 --> 01:43:20.48
combat troops have PTSD. And so it's a huge misrepresentation of the actual, uh, of the actual

1027
01:43:20.48 --> 01:43:26.24
scale. And so I wanted civilians to see that story, but here here's a veteran that came,

1028
01:43:27.04 --> 01:43:34.40
came home and was, you know, he was able to kind of adapt or process what he'd seen.

1029
01:43:34.40 --> 01:43:40.48
No, I think that's 100% right. And I think you get, you get, you nailed it and mad as nailed it.

1030
01:43:40.48 --> 01:43:43.76
Like you set the expectations that everyone thinks that when they go to war, they're going to be

1031
01:43:43.76 --> 01:43:48.64
all screwed up. It's like, that's what's going to happen to him. But if they, if they get told,

1032
01:43:48.64 --> 01:43:53.44
hey, and, and I mean, you know, you just said, when you came home, you were better.

1033
01:43:54.16 --> 01:44:00.88
Yeah. And like that's awesome. And, you know, I had that conversation with Sam Harris, where,

1034
01:44:00.88 --> 01:44:06.80
you know, he'd asked me, he said, hey, you know, you, you get told, I hear you saying that

1035
01:44:06.80 --> 01:44:10.88
war is horrible and war is held. But at the same time, you say that it was like the best

1036
01:44:10.88 --> 01:44:15.28
highlight of your life and it was, and I told him, and he's like, how do you reconcile those two

1037
01:44:15.28 --> 01:44:21.84
things? And I said, well, have you ever known someone that had cancer? And when they get, if they make it

1038
01:44:21.84 --> 01:44:26.40
through, they say it made them a better person, and they wouldn't wish no, and anyone, but it made

1039
01:44:26.40 --> 01:44:31.76
them a better person, and he said, yeah, and it made sense to them then. Yeah. And that's what I think

1040
01:44:31.76 --> 01:44:37.68
is an important thing. And, you know, look at the, I mean, every war has incredible veterans that

1041
01:44:37.68 --> 01:44:43.20
come home and do incredible things. Yeah. And I mean, Charlie Plum, when he was on, you know,

1042
01:44:43.20 --> 01:44:48.96
after being in the Hanoi Hilton for six years, and he rattled off the guys that were in the

1043
01:44:48.96 --> 01:44:55.44
Hanoi Hilton with him. Yeah. That were, you know, presidents and and congressman, and just all these

1044
01:44:55.44 --> 01:45:00.40
incredible achievements, maybe presidents, but incredible, incredible achievements, well,

1045
01:45:00.40 --> 01:45:05.76
presidential candidate with stockdale. So, and and McCain, right? Two presidential candidates. So,

1046
01:45:06.64 --> 01:45:14.96
so, incredible achievements. And yet, the media and the Hollywood, they don't shine the light on that.

1047
01:45:14.96 --> 01:45:20.32
What they shine the light on is the people that are having issues, which, again, like you said,

1048
01:45:20.32 --> 01:45:26.80
that's real, too. Yeah. But the fact that you made this huge effort in our continuing to make a huge

1049
01:45:26.80 --> 01:45:34.000
effort to show not just civilians, but also military that, yeah, war is bad. I mean, you, you

1050
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.48
say, you had a traumatic experience, you had a freaking life changing experience, and you've come

1051
01:45:38.48 --> 01:45:46.24
back, and you've, you've proven that that traumatic experience is not as strong as you are.

1052
01:45:46.24 --> 01:45:52.56
And I think that's the most important message that that anyone could communicate back to

1053
01:45:52.56 --> 01:45:57.84
both sides, both a civilian and military side. Yeah. And I mean, there's so much to be said about

1054
01:45:58.56 --> 01:46:04.32
what, knowing something is already possible. So, I told you about Dan Kinnos in last time I was here.

1055
01:46:04.72 --> 01:46:10.96
And back then, he was about a year and a half in front of me. Yeah. And he was showing me what was

1056
01:46:10.96 --> 01:46:16.56
possible for me. I didn't know that it was possible to be able to walk around and with a huge

1057
01:46:16.56 --> 01:46:23.12
back back on and use a no-canes, but once I saw it, it's like, oh, so it is, Paul. And it just made it

1058
01:46:23.92 --> 01:46:31.76
so much easier to do. And I was doing a talk not too long ago, and somebody told me afterwards

1059
01:46:32.80 --> 01:46:37.68
that something that I didn't even realize. I was, you know, how last time I was talking about

1060
01:46:37.68 --> 01:46:43.92
finding ideas and that we do that thing called proof the lane. And they told me that that

1061
01:46:45.04 --> 01:46:50.000
they just kind of mentioned to me that I kind of had continued, I did that in the Marine Corps.

1062
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.88
And I did this thing called proofing the lane where I was proving what what I was, you know,

1063
01:46:54.88 --> 01:47:00.16
stepping on the ground and proving was cleared. And then they said that kind of that, I didn't

1064
01:47:00.16 --> 01:47:05.52
realize at this time, but they said that theme is following you wherever you go. So I'm now

1065
01:47:05.52 --> 01:47:10.32
proofing the lane for these, these veterans that may be struggling a little bit. I'm not

1066
01:47:10.32 --> 01:47:15.36
trying to improving what's possible. And so, yeah, I'm glad that they, glad that they told me that

1067
01:47:15.36 --> 01:47:18.88
because they really make sense to me. That makes total sense. And Dan Kinausin, who's a total

1068
01:47:18.88 --> 01:47:25.04
stud. Is it about being a pair of things? Again? Yeah, again, he's also in the Pionn. Was it Pionn?

1069
01:47:25.04 --> 01:47:32.32
What's going on, yeah? Pionn, Chang. South Korea, two things, doing by Athlan and the

1070
01:47:32.32 --> 01:47:38.24
cross country scheme. Yeah, no, he's a total beast, a seal that that also lost both his legs above

1071
01:47:38.24 --> 01:47:47.20
the knee and just a total badass stud. I want to read a couple more little sections from your

1072
01:47:48.24 --> 01:47:53.68
journal to close this out. Here we go back to the journal. So when I get asked by people,

1073
01:47:53.68 --> 01:47:59.76
how could you fathom, let alone complete running 31 marathons in 31 days? I give them the same simple

1074
01:47:59.76 --> 01:48:07.68
answer because I am a marine. And my mission to fight for my fellow veterans has not changed.

1075
01:48:08.32 --> 01:48:13.20
And when a marine is on mission for his fellow marines, he is capable of anything.

1076
01:48:14.24 --> 01:48:19.36
Therefore, when people asked me, have it you don't enough? Sacrifice enough?

1077
01:48:20.56 --> 01:48:26.56
I remind them that not only do I have the capability to accomplish my mission, be proud of my

1078
01:48:26.56 --> 01:48:34.000
marine core heritage, stay faithful to my fellow marines and keep fighting. I have the responsibility.

1079
01:48:34.72 --> 01:48:40.000
I have the responsibility to keep fighting from my country, my core and my fellow veterans.

1080
01:48:41.12 --> 01:48:47.28
So no, it will never be enough. The day that I have done enough will be the day that six

1081
01:48:47.28 --> 01:48:52.32
marines lower my body into my grave in Arlington, Cemetery.

1082
01:48:52.32 --> 01:49:04.80
And how can I do it? I do it because it is my duty and to do my duty is my honor.

1083
01:49:08.80 --> 01:49:16.80
In one last little passage I want to read from your journal. It says, I am merely a representative

1084
01:49:16.80 --> 01:49:26.32
of what is possible for any veteran, any person. So as time passes, I do not want my name to be remembered.

1085
01:49:27.60 --> 01:49:35.36
All I want to be remembered is the story. Years from now, when people speak about this,

1086
01:49:35.36 --> 01:49:39.68
I want them to say, I remember that guy who ran all those marathons that one time,

1087
01:49:39.68 --> 01:49:47.60
and their friend will reply, what was his name? And they will say, I don't remember.

1088
01:49:49.20 --> 01:49:50.32
But he was a marine.

1089
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:04.08
Well, Rob, I can tell you that I've got a feeling that you will be remembered and your name will

1090
01:50:04.08 --> 01:50:12.80
be remembered in the way that you have represented the Marines and America and mankind will be remembered

1091
01:50:16.16 --> 01:50:25.36
and remembered and revered as well. So thanks for coming on the show again and letting us all know

1092
01:50:25.36 --> 01:50:37.76
that we are capable of much, much more if we just step up and push a little bit harder.

1093
01:50:40.72 --> 01:50:45.44
Been awesome having you back on, man. It's been awesome being here. I mean again,

1094
01:50:46.48 --> 01:50:53.20
I'm glad I can come up with the material. Once you said you invited me back, I was like,

1095
01:50:53.20 --> 01:50:57.92
I got to start writing some stuff. You don't have to write these words just come on and talk.

1096
01:50:57.92 --> 01:51:04.08
Echo, you got any questions for the man? Yeah, was there any time during the 31 marathons that you were

1097
01:51:04.08 --> 01:51:10.96
like, oh, this is kind of lame. I've kind of off this now. Were you ever think that? I mean,

1098
01:51:10.96 --> 01:51:16.64
not even necessarily that you were tired physically or nothing, just kind of like, you know,

1099
01:51:16.64 --> 01:51:21.04
this is kind of interesting. I definitely got tired of doing the interviews. Oh, okay. Yeah.

1100
01:51:21.04 --> 01:51:27.28
But the thing with that is the interviews, you know, I didn't, I wasn't doing this to like

1101
01:51:27.28 --> 01:51:33.44
to get a bunch of, you know, people tell me I'm awesome, you know, anything. But the interviews,

1102
01:51:33.44 --> 01:51:39.36
so doing the marathons without the interviews would be pointless because the story wouldn't

1103
01:51:39.36 --> 01:51:43.36
get out there without doing the interviews, but doing the interviews without the story without

1104
01:51:43.36 --> 01:51:52.48
doing the marathons is actually, is also a point. Really. Kind of got the funny thing is, I did this

1105
01:51:52.48 --> 01:51:56.64
because it was going to be hard. I did this because it was going to be really difficult. Yeah.

1106
01:51:56.64 --> 01:52:00.48
And I knew that going in and that's the whole purpose of it. It was just do something that was hard.

1107
01:52:00.48 --> 01:52:04.48
And then, you know, the last four days and then Houston and stuff when it started to get hard,

1108
01:52:04.48 --> 01:52:16.72
I was like, shit. Was it hard? Yeah. But yeah, I, like I said, I was saying before there was

1109
01:52:16.72 --> 01:52:21.12
never a point where I was like, there's no way I can do this or anything like that. I was like,

1110
01:52:21.12 --> 01:52:28.40
as long as I don't get severely injured by a mistake, don't get hit by a car or, you know,

1111
01:52:28.40 --> 01:52:34.000
break a bone or something, then I'm going to be able to do this. Yeah. I'm going to get her done.

1112
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.24
Yeah. I feel like, like, everyone's at all when I do something that takes a long time, like months or

1113
01:52:38.24 --> 01:52:44.72
something like that, I get to a point. Everyone's at a while. I want to make it. Yeah. It definitely gets,

1114
01:52:44.72 --> 01:52:48.40
I mean, it gets repetitive for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. I'm going to make a

1115
01:52:48.40 --> 01:52:53.84
guess. Wake up, run marathon. You don't listen to music. You don't listen to do this in a podcast,

1116
01:52:53.84 --> 01:53:00.32
do you listen to music? I didn't really on the month of marathon except a few times because

1117
01:53:00.32 --> 01:53:04.56
you have to live with you. I have people with me and you're just going to be like, hey, I'm listening to a podcast.

1118
01:53:04.56 --> 01:53:09.28
Leave me alone. Well, sometimes I did do that to be honest with you. There were times I did do that

1119
01:53:10.80 --> 01:53:19.28
sometimes. That went same on in that jocca podcast. You're hoping for a long one. One of the

1120
01:53:19.28 --> 01:53:25.60
few people I was hoping for a four hour podcast. Did you do it? There were, I felt kind of bad in the

1121
01:53:25.60 --> 01:53:29.76
last four because I told you my back was hurting so much. And I was like, every time I landed on

1122
01:53:29.76 --> 01:53:34.32
that right foot of me, severe pain, and then I kind of make me kind of gasped a little bit.

1123
01:53:34.32 --> 01:53:38.80
Oh, yeah. And so I felt really bad because there's a lot of people that were,

1124
01:53:39.52 --> 01:53:44.48
they came out to run with me and they were like talking to me and trying to help me keep going.

1125
01:53:44.48 --> 01:53:49.12
But I just was not in the mood for talking. You know, when I felt terrible because they'd be

1126
01:53:49.12 --> 01:53:53.28
like asking me questions. I'd be like, given in the one word, you know, like, oh, you know,

1127
01:53:53.28 --> 01:53:58.08
but what's your favorite place or whatever? I'm like, oh, I don't know. And it's, I just,

1128
01:53:58.08 --> 01:54:05.52
I, so I wish I could have handled that part a little bit better and, you know, get let those people

1129
01:54:05.52 --> 01:54:10.56
go talk to those people a little bit. But I'm sure they understand why I kind of set it before

1130
01:54:10.56 --> 01:54:13.84
and they listen to everybody. Yeah, if I'm not talking to it because I have this back injury.

1131
01:54:14.64 --> 01:54:17.20
It's not because I don't like you. Yeah, because I hate you.

1132
01:54:17.20 --> 01:54:26.64
Yeah, so it's that. But you know, when it got hard, I fell back on on my mission and that's what's

1133
01:54:28.40 --> 01:54:32.40
that's what I was doing at four. I didn't whether or not I was hurting or didn't feel like doing it.

1134
01:54:33.36 --> 01:54:36.56
Was not as important as it is. Does it have anything to do with anything really does it?

1135
01:54:36.56 --> 01:54:41.76
Yeah, just not very. Can I ask you, I want to ask your opinion on something because I came up with a theory

1136
01:54:41.76 --> 01:54:49.52
and it's not totally thought out yet and like my mother's and this theory might actually get me killed.

1137
01:54:49.52 --> 01:54:58.16
So please echo, of a defending me. I think that there may be something that's more powerful than discipline.

1138
01:54:59.68 --> 01:55:05.60
And what? Anybody that's listening, Jaco reach for the knife?

1139
01:55:05.60 --> 01:55:14.96
And maybe it's just that they're kind of going hand in hand. But I think the one thing that may be as powerful

1140
01:55:14.96 --> 01:55:23.84
or maybe even more powerful than the discipline is selflessness. And so the reason I say that is because

1141
01:55:24.88 --> 01:55:33.52
I don't know, maybe the discipline leads to the ability to perform the selfless act.

1142
01:55:33.52 --> 01:55:40.24
But it seems to me like all the discipline in the world might not allow you to

1143
01:55:41.36 --> 01:55:48.80
do something like lift a car off of your child or dive on a grenade.

1144
01:55:48.80 --> 01:55:53.68
Well, yeah, I mean, I think you're actually a hundred percent right on. That's a theory. I think that

1145
01:55:54.32 --> 01:55:59.76
when you take guys in combat, when when when guys are in combat and guys do incredible things and

1146
01:55:59.76 --> 01:56:03.44
sacrifice their lives for their brothers, that that is not about discipline and

1147
01:56:04.80 --> 01:56:08.88
they're doing that because they're selfless and they want to take care of their friends.

1148
01:56:08.88 --> 01:56:12.48
That's what they're doing it for. And there can be people that are

1149
01:56:13.92 --> 01:56:20.72
undisciplined individuals that perform incredibly heroic things in combat.

1150
01:56:20.72 --> 01:56:26.32
So no, I don't think I don't think it's, I don't think it's, I think that's actually correct.

1151
01:56:26.32 --> 01:56:31.84
I mean, I think there's that's an extremely powerful force. And that may be

1152
01:56:33.12 --> 01:56:34.64
that. And I was thinking about

1153
01:56:36.32 --> 01:56:39.44
the power of that, where I thought you were going to say,

1154
01:56:39.44 --> 01:56:43.52
where I thought you were going to talk about it was, you weren't doing this for yourself.

1155
01:56:44.24 --> 01:56:49.28
You weren't doing this for yourself. You were doing this to get a message out there that you're

1156
01:56:49.28 --> 01:56:55.36
doing this to raise money for others, for your friends, for your brothers. That's that is a more

1157
01:56:55.36 --> 01:57:00.48
powerful thing than, hey, I'm just a self-disciplined person. Now, discipline is like,

1158
01:57:01.68 --> 01:57:06.24
it's like they're, they're indifferent. It's not apples to apples. I don't think it's not like,

1159
01:57:06.24 --> 01:57:10.72
it's not like this is more powerful than that. No, because I'll tell you that

1160
01:57:11.84 --> 01:57:17.04
if you want to perform well, if you want to achieve things, like you wouldn't be able to do this

1161
01:57:18.08 --> 01:57:21.84
for these causes, if you didn't have the discipline to train hard to eat right, to get on the path,

1162
01:57:21.84 --> 01:57:25.92
to stay on the path, you wouldn't have been able to do this. Even though you really wanted to,

1163
01:57:25.92 --> 01:57:29.76
even though you really, really wanted to, you really, really wanted to care about your brothers. You

1164
01:57:29.76 --> 01:57:34.000
really, really wanted to raise money for those funds. If you don't have the discipline to make it happen

1165
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.56
and train yourself and be ready, that, that you wouldn't have been able to deliver that. Just like

1166
01:57:38.56 --> 01:57:42.80
a guy on the battlefield, they're on the battlefield because they, they were able to perform.

1167
01:57:42.80 --> 01:57:48.16
They were able to have the discipline to get to that point. But they're too, I'd say they're

1168
01:57:48.16 --> 01:57:53.44
related. I don't think they're, they're definitely not opposing each other. And in fact, I think that

1169
01:57:53.44 --> 01:58:02.72
if I was to tell you, you know, when I was in the seal teams, the actual driving force behind

1170
01:58:02.72 --> 01:58:10.000
the discipline that I tried to have myself wasn't for me. It was like, I want to be able to perform

1171
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.12
well in the battlefield, not because I want to perform well, but because I want to make sure I don't

1172
01:58:13.12 --> 01:58:20.80
let my brothers down. So I would say it's actually like a force that's a foundational force.

1173
01:58:20.80 --> 01:58:26.56
You know, it's like people that are heavily, heavily religious. Their discipline relies on their

1174
01:58:26.56 --> 01:58:33.84
religious faith. People that are overachievers that want to accomplish something. Their discipline is

1175
01:58:33.84 --> 01:58:38.64
based on the fact that they want to get that achievement. So the discipline by itself,

1176
01:58:38.64 --> 01:58:43.44
there has to be something that the discipline, there has to be a foundation that that's built

1177
01:58:43.44 --> 01:58:48.88
upon. And I think a lot of times people build their foundation of discipline. The foundation

1178
01:58:48.88 --> 01:58:53.92
that their discipline is built on is actually the fact that they want to take care of their friends.

1179
01:58:53.92 --> 01:58:56.40
They want to be able to take care of their brothers. They want to take care of their family.

1180
01:58:57.44 --> 01:59:03.28
You get all kinds of, you know, you take a single mom that's working three jobs right now.

1181
01:59:03.28 --> 01:59:08.24
Well, she's has to be highly disciplined. She has to be highly disciplined. She's got to get up every

1182
01:59:08.24 --> 01:59:12.88
morning at three o'clock to get to the diner in time to start waiting tables. She's doing that.

1183
01:59:12.88 --> 01:59:18.16
She has that discipline not based on the fact that she wants to be stronger for herself.

1184
01:59:18.16 --> 01:59:22.40
She's doing that so she can feed her kids. She's doing that. She's doing that selflessly so that

1185
01:59:22.40 --> 01:59:28.72
she can feed her kids. So no, I mean, that's absolutely true. And I totally agree.

1186
01:59:28.72 --> 01:59:29.44
Good morning.

1187
01:59:29.44 --> 01:59:30.16
Yeah.

1188
01:59:30.16 --> 01:59:36.48
Supporting. Yeah, I think the the best way the way to get the most out of yourself is to figure out

1189
01:59:36.48 --> 01:59:39.36
a way to make it about something that you care about more than yourself.

1190
01:59:39.36 --> 01:59:45.36
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that discipline is a manifestation of selflessly.

1191
01:59:45.36 --> 01:59:51.12
Yes. In many ways. It's a way that you're like I said, a single mom that's working three jobs.

1192
01:59:51.12 --> 01:59:54.48
Look, let's face it. She doesn't want to work any of those three jobs.

1193
01:59:55.20 --> 01:59:58.48
She doesn't want to work any of those three jobs. But she's doing it. She's doing it every day

1194
01:59:58.48 --> 02:00:03.44
day and day out. Why is she doing that? She why is she just showing that discipline and

1195
02:00:03.44 --> 02:00:07.44
manifesting that discipline? Yeah. It's because she cares about her kids more than she cares about

1196
02:00:07.44 --> 02:00:10.88
herself. Yeah. And that's all there is to it. And you could go to the battlefield and say the same

1197
02:00:10.88 --> 02:00:16.16
thing. Why do why do why do you why do Marines train so hard? Yeah. Exactly. Why do we train hard

1198
02:00:16.16 --> 02:00:20.80
in the sealed teams? What why are we doing that? Are we doing that for ourselves? Are we imposing that

1199
02:00:20.80 --> 02:00:26.08
discipline on ourselves? Are we having the self discipline? Because we want to be good for ourselves?

1200
02:00:26.08 --> 02:00:29.12
No. It's because we want to be able to take care of our friends. We want to be able to take care of our

1201
02:00:29.12 --> 02:00:34.96
brothers and you could go across the board with any of that. So I totally agree with you. Awesome.

1202
02:00:34.96 --> 02:00:45.28
One glad that I'm still alive now. Check. But could they at any point come into conflict with each

1203
02:00:45.28 --> 02:00:52.000
other? Were you got to choose to remain disciplined or serve others? I don't see how they would

1204
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.24
come in conflict with you. And if they did come in conflict, I think you make a rational decision.

1205
02:00:56.24 --> 02:01:03.92
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, hey, am I going to get sneak my workout in? Like what's more important

1206
02:01:03.92 --> 02:01:10.72
to me working out or going on a mission with my friends? Right. Or you're, I don't know,

1207
02:01:10.72 --> 02:01:15.04
daughters, piano or recital that they want you to be at, but you got it. You know, that's it's

1208
02:01:15.04 --> 02:01:18.64
that's it's a matter of time. You got to choose. Choose between what? Being disciplined with the

1209
02:01:18.64 --> 02:01:23.76
workout that day. Okay. I'm making the recital. Right. I mean, obviously you want to make the recital.

1210
02:01:23.76 --> 02:01:28.56
But if the, if the choice was between making the recital and you have to go to your job and work,

1211
02:01:28.96 --> 02:01:32.56
well, if you don't go to your job and work, that's what now you don't have money to pay for your

1212
02:01:32.56 --> 02:01:37.04
piano lessons in the first place. Yeah. Yeah. No matter if think about that, that's all I'm saying

1213
02:01:37.04 --> 02:01:43.60
that it is there a population where discipline and selflessness will come into conflict. I'm

1214
02:01:43.60 --> 02:01:47.68
just saying usually they support each other and for sure. I think you're right. But is there a circumstance?

1215
02:01:47.68 --> 02:01:53.28
Yes, there's there is there is you could actually become, you could actually focus on yourself and be like,

1216
02:01:53.28 --> 02:01:58.16
hey, it's more important for me to take care of me than it is for me to take care of my team.

1217
02:01:58.88 --> 02:02:04.16
And that's not going to go over well with the team and we may end up being a highly disciplined

1218
02:02:04.16 --> 02:02:10.48
individual. You have no, you have no outlet for it because you have no one to take care of if you're

1219
02:02:10.48 --> 02:02:16.32
except for yourself. And then that's the way you see like the, what's the, I haven't watched the movie,

1220
02:02:16.32 --> 02:02:20.32
but I know exactly, no, I'm serious. I haven't watched the movie. It's American psyched. Right.

1221
02:02:20.32 --> 02:02:25.12
Oh, I see, no, I haven't watched the movie, but I know exactly what the story is. The guy is like

1222
02:02:25.12 --> 02:02:30.16
super highly disciplined, right? Yeah. He's need to wait. He does everything highly disciplined. But at the

1223
02:02:30.16 --> 02:02:35.84
same time, obviously he's a psycho and he's, he's not supporting anyone but himself. Sure. So that's

1224
02:02:35.84 --> 02:02:40.48
like an extreme version of someone that cares about themselves. Right. Yeah, the sure they're highly

1225
02:02:40.48 --> 02:02:45.92
disciplined, but you know, being highly disciplined doesn't make you a good person. Yeah, it doesn't

1226
02:02:45.92 --> 02:02:50.48
automatically make you so well. Yeah, it doesn't make you self-listened. It certainly doesn't make

1227
02:02:50.48 --> 02:02:55.52
you a good person either. Yeah. And you could certainly get into a situation where you know,

1228
02:02:55.52 --> 02:03:01.12
you get people that are, uh, bank robbers. No, highly disciplined bank robbers. I wasn't thinking

1229
02:03:01.12 --> 02:03:07.52
big robbers, but you think, you know, the people that are so into working out that that trumps,

1230
02:03:07.52 --> 02:03:12.72
yeah, family, and that everything trumps everything. Yeah. And they, and they have an issue, right?

1231
02:03:12.72 --> 02:03:17.60
They're so into it that they, that they sacrifice, not even sacrifice. They just don't care.

1232
02:03:17.60 --> 02:03:23.92
Yeah, yeah. It's, uh, you know when you meet someone that's so into working out that, I mean, that's a

1233
02:03:23.92 --> 02:03:29.92
very selfish thing, right? Working out as a selfish thing, right? Now, there's part of it that's

1234
02:03:29.92 --> 02:03:34.000
self-less because you're working out so that you can stay healthy so that you can take care of your

1235
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.28
family. You can take care of your friends like we just thought about. Yeah, but you can take that to a point.

1236
02:03:37.28 --> 02:03:42.64
Yeah, so you're capable of surviving and taking care of your friends and family. But you can

1237
02:03:42.64 --> 02:03:48.48
easily get to a point where hey, the most important thing is me. Yeah, my pull-up. The most important

1238
02:03:48.48 --> 02:03:52.80
thing is me and my numbers. Yeah, my numbers. And you know what, I was danger close to this

1239
02:03:53.52 --> 02:03:59.12
with Jiu Jitsu because for a while, I was like, I had come home at night and my wife would be like,

1240
02:03:59.12 --> 02:04:04.08
you know, this is I was still in the teams. Yeah. And I was, was a task unit commander like we,

1241
02:04:04.08 --> 02:04:08.72
I was, that that was the most important thing in my life. But I was still come home at night at 7

1242
02:04:08.72 --> 02:04:13.36
30 at night or 8 o'clock at night and I grabbed my gym bag and I'd go change Jitsu and my wife would be like,

1243
02:04:13.36 --> 02:04:19.36
what the hell is wrong with you? Yeah. Like, what are you doing? And that's that was borderline,

1244
02:04:19.36 --> 02:04:25.68
right? That was borderline. But for me, it was like, hey, this is a skill set that I should have

1245
02:04:26.40 --> 02:04:30.56
when I'm on the battlefield. So I can take care of myself and take care of my friends. And by the way,

1246
02:04:30.56 --> 02:04:37.76
that means I have a 1.001% chance that I'm going to come home instead of not come home. So I'm going to do it.

1247
02:04:37.76 --> 02:04:43.20
And that, you write there, that's probably a little bit of rationalization because, because

1248
02:04:43.20 --> 02:04:47.36
selfishly I really love training Jitsu. Yeah. So there's, there's a selfishness there and

1249
02:04:47.36 --> 02:04:51.92
I, that I just tried to rationalize a little bit. And, and you know, that's a good one.

1250
02:04:51.92 --> 02:04:55.84
Another thing we talked, we talked about the first podcast we do is rationalization and how

1251
02:04:55.84 --> 02:05:00.96
you got to be careful of that. You got to be careful of rationalizing everything. Yeah.

1252
02:05:00.96 --> 02:05:08.56
So yeah, those are those are things that definitely can get can become problematic. If you,

1253
02:05:09.60 --> 02:05:13.92
well, that's, you know what, that's why there's a dichotomy. That's why there's a dichotomy and

1254
02:05:13.92 --> 02:05:20.56
everything because you can go overboard with any personality trait you can go too far with.

1255
02:05:20.56 --> 02:05:26.000
Yeah. And you can definitely go that that's why I discipline and freedom. It's, it's actually

1256
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:31.60
a balance. Even though discipline equals freedom, but guess what? If you have pure discipline,

1257
02:05:31.60 --> 02:05:36.24
if you, if you, if you remove all freedom, well, then what did you just do? In slaves. Yeah,

1258
02:05:36.24 --> 02:05:43.20
you enslaved. So you, there's balance. There's balance in, in, in, in discipline. There has to be

1259
02:05:43.20 --> 02:05:46.96
balance in discipline. I think the reason that it strikes people to talk about discipline

1260
02:05:46.96 --> 02:05:51.60
equals freedom is because most people don't make that connection. And most people lean so far

1261
02:05:51.60 --> 02:05:55.60
towards just freedom of doing whatever they want. That they end up enslaved from a different

1262
02:05:55.60 --> 02:06:01.84
direction. Yeah. Which is equally, if not more problematic. And I say more problematic, because now

1263
02:06:01.84 --> 02:06:06.96
you're in a situation where you're slave, you're enslaved by something that's not good. That's not

1264
02:06:06.96 --> 02:06:11.68
healthy. That's not positive. Whereas at least with discipline, if you're imposing the discipline

1265
02:06:11.68 --> 02:06:17.20
on yourself, self-discipline, well, then you're, you're imposing things on you that are at least

1266
02:06:17.20 --> 02:06:23.28
positive long term. At a minimum, they're positive long term. Yeah. Now, can you go overboard

1267
02:06:23.28 --> 02:06:26.72
that? Yes. There's people that have eating disorders, right? Oh, yeah. There's people that

1268
02:06:26.72 --> 02:06:31.92
have eating disorders. They, they impose so it's such strict discipline that they're unhealthy.

1269
02:06:32.80 --> 02:06:39.36
And that's bad. And that's horrible. You know, I've, I've heard back from some people that said,

1270
02:06:39.36 --> 02:06:44.16
hey, you know, I have trouble with eating disorders. You know, it's generally been females

1271
02:06:44.16 --> 02:06:51.44
who have more trouble with that category. And they actually have to use the discipline to say

1272
02:06:51.44 --> 02:06:56.80
the correct discipline thing to do is to eat more is to eat the proper amount of calories.

1273
02:06:56.80 --> 02:07:02.08
Because it's a horrible, horrible thing if you see people going through that. And it's a fatal disease,

1274
02:07:02.08 --> 02:07:08.48
right? It's a fatal disease. And so, so again, to your point, there's, you can become so disciplined

1275
02:07:09.28 --> 02:07:14.08
that it's, that it's negative. Yeah. It's negative on your personal health. It's negative on your,

1276
02:07:14.08 --> 02:07:18.48
you know, you can work yourself. You can work yourself so hard. You can say, I'm going to be

1277
02:07:18.48 --> 02:07:22.80
disciplined at work. And now you, you stop, you lose the balance and you start, stop working

1278
02:07:22.80 --> 02:07:28.32
out and you stop training and you start eating donuts. And you start eating donuts, not before

1279
02:07:28.32 --> 02:07:33.92
you've run a marathon, but before you sit down in your front of your computer. Yeah. So they're,

1280
02:07:33.92 --> 02:07:45.60
they're absolutely has to be balanced. But, factually, the, the tendency, the, the tendency is,

1281
02:07:45.60 --> 02:07:48.64
I'm going to be, I'm going to be less disciplined. And I'm going to do things that are easy.

1282
02:07:48.64 --> 02:07:54.24
I'm going to be in the easy path. And that leads to that's, that's the 80% 90%. I'm the 1%.

1283
02:07:54.24 --> 02:07:58.88
But that is a vast majority of people, vast majority of people don't need less discipline in their

1284
02:07:58.88 --> 02:08:03.04
lives. They need more discipline. That's the vast majority of people myself included.

1285
02:08:03.44 --> 02:08:08.000
Myself and good need more discipline, not less. Yeah. It's all most about what you're being

1286
02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:12.56
disciplined towards. So like in the, uh, the situation, bring up with the recital,

1287
02:08:12.56 --> 02:08:19.68
you have the competing, uh, thing. So maybe it actually takes more discipline to

1288
02:08:20.64 --> 02:08:28.40
forego your workout. Realize. Oh, yeah. Bigger picture. People will say to me like on, uh, on Twitter,

1289
02:08:28.40 --> 02:08:32.96
they'll say, uh, if you have real discipline, once you have the discipline to sleep into tomorrow.

1290
02:08:34.88 --> 02:08:38.64
Then get out of your comfort zone and sleep in. Oh, yeah, that's the different thing. But,

1291
02:08:38.64 --> 02:08:43.68
yes, so you'd have to look at the bigger, is there a bigger discipline then, right? Because you

1292
02:08:43.68 --> 02:08:49.04
got to, you got to consider your goals and stuff like that. You can't have the discipline to sleep in

1293
02:08:49.04 --> 02:08:53.52
if that doesn't benefit your goal. It's not even disciplined. Yeah. And like the person that's

1294
02:08:53.52 --> 02:08:58.24
struggling with the, uh, eating disorder, their discipline, first they were disciplined to lose weight.

1295
02:08:58.24 --> 02:09:02.64
Right. They need to change that discipline to be a healthy, right? Consider the goal. Yeah.

1296
02:09:02.64 --> 02:09:06.08
The goal, the goal needs to be healthy. What a scary thing.

1297
02:09:06.08 --> 02:09:10.96
We're scary thing. You look in the mirror and you, you think you're overweight and you're not.

1298
02:09:10.96 --> 02:09:15.52
Some guys get that the opposite for sure. The body, body dysmorphia, more fielder. Yeah.

1299
02:09:15.52 --> 02:09:19.28
Is that what it's called? Yeah. So you can have it like, you know, you think you're always,

1300
02:09:19.28 --> 02:09:23.04
you always think you're fat, but you're not skinny. And then the other way is like, you always think you're

1301
02:09:23.04 --> 02:09:28.08
skinny. So you need bigger muscles. So you, you know, so you get on the juice. Yeah. Whatever. Yeah.

1302
02:09:28.08 --> 02:09:31.76
Yeah. Asteroids. That's actually why we're here. But echo.

1303
02:09:31.76 --> 02:09:37.28
We talked about this earlier. Too much curl or big enough muscles. Yeah.

1304
02:09:37.28 --> 02:09:39.28
Thanks. My muscles are big. Thanks. Rob Joe.

1305
02:09:39.28 --> 02:09:41.28
It's still supportive.

1306
02:09:41.28 --> 02:09:42.48
Man, it's still still supportive.

1307
02:09:42.48 --> 02:09:43.76
You've seen it before you started cutting weight.

1308
02:09:48.16 --> 02:09:52.16
Yeah. Speaking of health and support and support.

1309
02:09:52.96 --> 02:09:58.56
Echo Charles. Is there any way that you could advise us how to support

1310
02:09:58.56 --> 02:10:04.64
each ourselves ourselves and each other and possibly we just support you.

1311
02:10:04.64 --> 02:10:11.44
Support. Yeah. We support you. We support you. We did actually one of the benefits of having

1312
02:10:11.44 --> 02:10:17.92
you on is your very supportive for you. Encouraging, you know, and I like that. But in the event of

1313
02:10:18.56 --> 02:10:25.12
people us wanting to support this podcast in addition to each other in addition to ourselves.

1314
02:10:25.12 --> 02:10:33.04
Or all at once, we can stay on Jocco Superkrill Oil. I thought you were going to say the path.

1315
02:10:33.60 --> 02:10:38.96
Well, yeah. The path. That's bigger picture for sure. And we'll talk about that. But one of the

1316
02:10:38.96 --> 02:10:44.24
methods to stand the path is krill oil. You can live a lot of weight to get a strong muscles.

1317
02:10:44.24 --> 02:10:49.28
Kind of like, um, like when you tear your skin apart, I guess. But if you're joined to all jack

1318
02:10:49.28 --> 02:10:54.16
up, they don't want to move. You know, lifting nothing. So, and this goes for everyday life. So

1319
02:10:54.16 --> 02:11:02.000
superkrill oil, jocquests uplements. Finally, superkrill oil, joint warfare. And discipline, which is a

1320
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:08.08
pre-mission, what he cognate of enhancer, for a multiplier. Technically, what is for a small

1321
02:11:08.08 --> 02:11:13.68
to player mean? It's like when you get one thing and another and the sum is worth more than the

1322
02:11:13.68 --> 02:11:20.88
parts. Kind of. Yeah. You were so excited about that. I'm just going to let it roll. Anyway, three supplements,

1323
02:11:20.88 --> 02:11:25.84
right? Not counting the new one that's going to come out soon. So krill oil for your joints,

1324
02:11:25.84 --> 02:11:32.40
joint warfare for your joints and discipline, pre-mission. You take a cognitive enhancers,

1325
02:11:32.40 --> 02:11:38.56
a little bit caffeine in there. 15 kilograms. 15 milligrams. On the last. You drink multiple scoops.

1326
02:11:38.56 --> 02:11:43.92
Sure. Then it's third. I did an event the other night. And I was kind of tired going into it,

1327
02:11:43.92 --> 02:11:48.40
straight up. I was kind of tired. And it usually my events are during the day. But this is at night.

1328
02:11:48.40 --> 02:11:52.24
As I was kind of, you know, I'd flown out there and I was feeling a little bit sorry,

1329
02:11:52.24 --> 02:11:57.60
so I drank some discipline. And then I drank some more discipline. And I ended up having,

1330
02:11:58.40 --> 02:12:04.80
I guess there's a total sum total of about five scoops of discipline. Sure. So a few

1331
02:12:04.80 --> 02:12:10.16
much of discipline. 60 milligrams. But there's not just the discipline. Yeah. But anyways,

1332
02:12:10.16 --> 02:12:15.12
I got done with the event and went up to, you know, hung out with everyone for a little bit,

1333
02:12:15.12 --> 02:12:20.72
added a little dinner thing and then got done with that and then hung out and then went up to my room,

1334
02:12:20.72 --> 02:12:28.48
hotel room. And I just sat there. Yeah. Yeah. And the funny thing is I didn't realize. I was

1335
02:12:28.48 --> 02:12:31.60
why, because I had gotten up early in the morning, I worked out the travel, the bubble,

1336
02:12:31.60 --> 02:12:35.36
and I didn't realize why am I, why do I have energy right now? Why can't I sleep right now?

1337
02:12:35.36 --> 02:12:38.88
This is ridiculous. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?

1338
02:12:38.88 --> 02:12:44.16
And then, and then I didn't realize it till the next day, because I went to bed at one

1339
02:12:44.16 --> 02:12:50.88
30 in the morning, woke up at 430. And then I did like a stretch, came home. Jack's deal when I got

1340
02:12:50.88 --> 02:12:57.52
off. Of course. Yeah. I got home in the school, but which is nice, because my arm's been jacked up.

1341
02:12:57.52 --> 02:13:03.52
So I haven't been able to do, I still, I'm not doing overhead squats right now or even front squats.

1342
02:13:03.52 --> 02:13:09.68
Oh, right. I'm doing front squats with kettlebell. Yeah. If you don't want to have a bigger kettlebell

1343
02:13:09.68 --> 02:13:17.52
than other people, but whatever, sure. Sure. You got to be careful. Don't have the, if you're not

1344
02:13:17.52 --> 02:13:21.52
used to caffeine, because I'm not used to caffeine, because I only have jocowite, which has the same

1345
02:13:21.52 --> 02:13:27.84
15 milligrams, or discipline, if you're not used to caffeine, that little 15 milligrams, and you drink

1346
02:13:27.84 --> 02:13:31.12
up on you, but you're going to feel it. Don't drink it before you go to bed at night. Yeah. That's

1347
02:13:31.12 --> 02:13:36.64
my warning. Unless you have stuff to do. Let's get stuff to do. Yeah. Get after it. Yeah. You want

1348
02:13:36.64 --> 02:13:42.56
to balance the discipline. For sure. Yeah. You will not, you will feel sharp. That's what's good about

1349
02:13:42.56 --> 02:13:47.04
it. You feel sharp. It's fun. It's physically and mentally. When you or when someone says,

1350
02:13:47.04 --> 02:13:52.08
boy, I'm drinking the discipline, you ever watch space balls, show that show. Space ball

1351
02:13:52.08 --> 02:13:58.64
one. He's like liquid shorts. I can remember. It's like the shorts is the force. It's

1352
02:13:58.64 --> 02:14:03.04
the force. You know what space ball is? Yeah. Yeah. It's a parody. It's the force. It's the

1353
02:14:03.04 --> 02:14:07.76
shorts. Right? That's what it's the shorts. And then you have the liquid shorts. Oh, yeah.

1354
02:14:07.76 --> 02:14:12.08
So that's like the fuel or sorry for gays. This is a while ago. Anyway, that's how you sound when

1355
02:14:12.08 --> 02:14:15.28
you say I'm drinking the discipline. You can't drink the, you see what I'm saying? Yeah.

1356
02:14:16.08 --> 02:14:22.80
I think you meant to do that. Nonetheless, you get this at originmain.com on the top. It says

1357
02:14:22.80 --> 02:14:28.000
labs actually got emailed me. It was like, hey, I can't find the, I can't find the discipline. I

1358
02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:33.36
said look within yourself. Then I said the originmain.com on the top. It says labs. Just made a

1359
02:14:33.36 --> 02:14:38.88
funny. You like that. You know, I'm jumping back and forth. Anyway, that's where you get it.

1360
02:14:38.88 --> 02:14:45.68
Originmain.com. Also an originmain.com. They got some cool gays all made in America.

1361
02:14:46.48 --> 02:14:53.28
Rashcards. Compression gear. Tops and bottoms. Rashcards spats. Spats. Yeah. Moving the spats. Do they

1362
02:14:53.28 --> 02:14:59.68
have the black out yet? Yeah. I don't have any. You know, also look at the start planning

1363
02:14:59.68 --> 02:15:07.52
or schedule for the origin. Gigi to camp. Immersion camp. Yeah. It's not like a hard core. Like,

1364
02:15:07.52 --> 02:15:11.28
that's the thing. And that's what Pete kind of what old is what he was kind of telling me. Where

1365
02:15:11.28 --> 02:15:16.56
it's not like the kind. It's not like boot camp or something. Which would be cool too. It's not like a

1366
02:15:16.56 --> 02:15:21.60
training camp for like an event. I'm saying like you know, one guy's trying to read your training.

1367
02:15:21.60 --> 02:15:25.44
Yeah, yeah. We're training. We're training hard. But it's more like you're in there to immerse yourself

1368
02:15:25.44 --> 02:15:30.000
in your your you want to train hard. You want to learn hard. Yeah. Well, yeah. The case in point. There's

1369
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:33.76
a lot of people that have never even trained before. Yeah. Literally have never trained before. Yeah.

1370
02:15:33.76 --> 02:15:39.76
Got up. They said, hey, before this morning's class, I need to get a G. Yeah. Yeah. I don't even have a G.

1371
02:15:40.40 --> 02:15:43.84
So yeah, that's an August. You can check on the website for that too. Come on up. Echo

Charles and I will be there. You want to go? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Come on. It's like this cool. Yeah. Yeah.

1373
02:15:49.20 --> 02:15:53.60
Don't you can start learning more than I taught you last time we did you did. Oh yeah. The two moves

1374
02:15:53.60 --> 02:16:00.56
are we. I have two jits who legs now. Oh, you do. So what do they look like? It's you like.

1375
02:16:01.60 --> 02:16:07.52
Because I told you got to get rid of like the hard thing. Yeah. They were just the hard sockets.

1376
02:16:07.52 --> 02:16:14.64
Right. And so I did was, you know, I had trouble standing up. Yeah. So what I did was I had these two.

1377
02:16:14.64 --> 02:16:19.92
I have the sockets that go on my legs. So what I have my process do it's cover them in foam.

1378
02:16:20.96 --> 02:16:24.88
And then so that's a little bit softer from people so I don't hurt anybody. And then

1379
02:16:26.16 --> 02:16:31.20
he made it so I could just stand on the ends of those sockets. So at the same height. Yeah. So the same height.

1380
02:16:31.20 --> 02:16:38.16
Awesome. And so now I'm using them to you. I haven't started taking jits too. Because I'm

1381
02:16:38.16 --> 02:16:43.44
really busy, but I'm going to I think once we get back my wife and I are going to start going in.

1382
02:16:43.44 --> 02:16:48.32
Awesome. And then I also use them to do some weightlifting stuff. I've been able to figure out how to do

1383
02:16:48.32 --> 02:16:57.04
squats off the ground. Nice squats. And yeah, so it's awesome. So I'll be ready.

1384
02:16:57.04 --> 02:17:01.36
Yeah. No, that is awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Because the biggest concern I had last time was the

1385
02:17:02.40 --> 02:17:08.16
shell had like a like a metal thing. Yeah, valve. And that thing was uncool. Oh yeah.

1386
02:17:08.16 --> 02:17:15.04
I mean, no, I didn't realize at the time that you were insulting me because that's how I do

1387
02:17:15.04 --> 02:17:21.92
not so after, not until after because the whole time you were after we rolled you were like,

1388
02:17:21.92 --> 02:17:25.12
oh yeah, you're really strong. You're really strong. And then a couple of times later,

1389
02:17:25.12 --> 02:17:29.68
it's a couple of podcasts later. You're like, oh, it's actually an insult. Yeah. Yeah.

1390
02:17:29.68 --> 02:17:33.28
Yeah. You don't have any technique, but you're strong. You know, one of the

1391
02:17:33.28 --> 02:17:38.08
tell I learned that was almost optimistic to a fault was that when we were all, he talked about this

1392
02:17:38.08 --> 02:17:42.48
before when we were all, I was like, there's gotta be a way that I can catch Jaco. There's gotta be

1393
02:17:42.48 --> 02:17:46.56
some way in that guy. Like, um, who was the guy that's missing his hand that we rolled with,

1394
02:17:46.56 --> 02:17:52.48
I rolled with after. Oh, Jeffrey. Yeah. Jeffrey, I had him in, I had him by the neck and I was like,

1395
02:17:52.48 --> 02:17:56.56
oh, dang, I got him. I can't believe that's like got him. And then afterwards, he's like,

1396
02:17:56.56 --> 02:18:00.32
there was no possible way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like I was somehow, somehow,

1397
02:18:00.32 --> 02:18:07.36
was it so optimistic about what I can do to fault? It is. And you're the, you're with so many people.

1398
02:18:07.36 --> 02:18:11.84
Yeah. But majority of people, especially with Jitsu, fall in that category and like, well,

1399
02:18:11.84 --> 02:18:16.000
and the other funny thing is you'll get somebody with something. And then they think to themselves,

1400
02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:21.60
if I could, if I just stop that, then I'll be able to win. I had a, I had a wrestler. This was

1401
02:18:21.60 --> 02:18:29.76
back in the day. I was like, I blew belt and I was going to get this wrestler, uh, you know,

1402
02:18:29.76 --> 02:18:36.80
like a really good college wrestler. And the look on his face every single time was just, okay,

1403
02:18:36.80 --> 02:18:42.56
let's go, let's go again. He was the first person that I realized that that's the normal reaction,

1404
02:18:42.56 --> 02:18:46.80
but especially for a wrestler because wrestling that wrestling college men, they've been dominating

1405
02:18:46.80 --> 02:18:50.88
people in high school, they've been dominating people in college. They know they, they understand

1406
02:18:50.88 --> 02:18:56.88
grappling. And so when they get, they get like, yeah, submitted. They just can't, they just don't even understand.

1407
02:18:56.88 --> 02:19:01.44
It seems like the one thing they ever thought before. And you know, and then, and I don't know,

1408
02:19:01.44 --> 02:19:07.36
you can, you can, you can give me some advice on this. Is it better? Because I've done it both ways.

1409
02:19:07.36 --> 02:19:11.92
Is it better to submit them with the same thing every single time, which I've done that,

1410
02:19:11.92 --> 02:19:16.40
or to submit them something new every single time, where they just are dumbfounded. Yeah,

1411
02:19:16.40 --> 02:19:20.48
I think the second one gets, especially giving what you said, because it's true, the wrestler,

1412
02:19:20.48 --> 02:19:25.12
he's going to have all this knowledge of grappling. So, and it makes sense, you know, so you see this

1413
02:19:25.12 --> 02:19:29.68
one weird thing that you never seen. In your mind, you're like, all right, that's just one weird kind of

1414
02:19:29.68 --> 02:19:33.36
rare kind of thing. It's a feeling. And then, but if you're like this thing, this thing, this thing,

1415
02:19:33.36 --> 02:19:37.12
this thing, it's like, okay, this world is opening up. No, okay, I understand,

1416
02:19:37.12 --> 02:19:41.12
you know, there's a lot of fluke. Yes, it wasn't just that one thing, like how you say that one thing.

1417
02:19:41.12 --> 02:19:45.68
I just got to stay away from his or putting my neck in there. Yeah, stay away from that. That's all.

1418
02:19:45.68 --> 02:19:51.28
So, it kind of depends, or, or, or deviates from that whole idea. So, we'll be having these discussions

1419
02:19:51.28 --> 02:19:59.68
and many more at the immersion camp in Maine in August. Okay, so yeah, it's right before school starts.

1420
02:19:59.68 --> 02:20:06.56
Yeah, so yeah, those are good fun. Yeah. You know, yeah, originmain.com. Check it out. Good

1421
02:20:06.56 --> 02:20:12.64
way to support. Also, Jockel talked about his new cool kettlebell that's heavier than my nonetheless.

1422
02:20:12.64 --> 02:20:15.68
I got the whole set on, you know, the, you know, the kettlebells I'm not wearing, but the

1423
02:20:15.68 --> 02:20:21.60
intimate, or the, the, the primal bells. You want to write whatever? Yeah, I wrote it. I think too,

1424
02:20:21.60 --> 02:20:25.68
it's like a cyclops in there too. Anyway, any more word on the Jockel head or is that,

1425
02:20:25.68 --> 02:20:29.44
they're not going to have a, yeah, it's still working part. We're in the idea phase on the, I'm still,

1426
02:20:29.44 --> 02:20:35.28
but yeah, that's good. But nonetheless, you want to whole set, go to on it.com slash Jockel. Really good

1427
02:20:35.28 --> 02:20:39.04
kettlebells on there. Other exercise stuff on there too. You want to switch up your workout.

1428
02:20:39.68 --> 02:20:44.72
I ran into that the other day, like, dangness workout is getting boring. So, I just beat you

1429
02:20:44.72 --> 02:20:49.60
through it. Yeah. And then did you, because it's good to do things and you brought this up before,

1430
02:20:50.24 --> 02:20:53.68
if you're not used to something, even though it's like, we talked about squats, like,

1431
02:20:53.68 --> 02:20:59.76
going all the way down, which is what I'm used to. If I was to do squats to, what does it pair

1432
02:20:59.76 --> 02:21:03.76
all the other deck? That's the standard. Yeah, the standard. And then those squats would actually

1433
02:21:03.76 --> 02:21:09.20
be a little bit harder for me for like a week or two weeks. And then I'd realize it going down in

1434
02:21:09.20 --> 02:21:13.36
the whole, as a place where we get, yeah. But, and it goes along with exactly what you're saying,

1435
02:21:13.36 --> 02:21:17.68
how like your brain has to do, it's called neuromuscular connection. Where if you're used to

1436
02:21:17.68 --> 02:21:21.68
doing a certain motion, you can do it way more efficiently. Put more weight on there. We're pretty

1437
02:21:21.68 --> 02:21:26.48
efficient, you know, and that's what gain, where gains come from. Yeah. Or a big part of where it

1438
02:21:26.48 --> 02:21:32.40
gains come from. So, yeah, you just, you just change the movement, just a little bit. Boom,

1439
02:21:32.40 --> 02:21:36.56
whole another thing, your body gotta get used to, more gains to be had. Well, that's the whole

1440
02:21:36.56 --> 02:21:40.32
theory of Westside Barbel, isn't they change their, the way they do something every three weeks.

1441
02:21:40.32 --> 02:21:44.72
They do that instead of doing the bench press the same exact way that they did that for three

1442
02:21:44.72 --> 02:21:47.68
weeks. And then the next three weeks, they do it wide. They do it with a different kind of bar.

1443
02:21:47.68 --> 02:21:54.56
They do it different range of motion. So, once you, they don't allow their by to totally adapt

1444
02:21:54.56 --> 02:21:58.80
and constantly changing and just kind of, yeah, there's pretty, there's a lot of cool ways you

1445
02:21:58.80 --> 02:22:02.80
can kind of manipulate that from work out to work out. But yeah, well, so yeah, if you want to

1446
02:22:02.80 --> 02:22:06.80
vary up your workout with all kinds of different movements on it, they have some cool stuff,

1447
02:22:06.80 --> 02:22:12.24
battle maces or no battle ropes, maces, some other stuff. Anyway, on it.com slash

02:23:05.68 --> 02:23:13.84
values is the excerpts. For sure. Because a lot of times, I mean, aside from seeing what you and

1457
02:23:13.84 --> 02:23:20.40
our guests look like, you know, the video version, whatever, the excerpts are shareable, and I didn't

1458
02:23:20.40 --> 02:23:28.32
realize how valuable that was with the sharing until when. I think it's a gradually increasing

1459
02:23:28.32 --> 02:23:33.52
understanding of the value overall. Nonetheless, I could go into all the people that say,

1460
02:23:33.52 --> 02:23:36.24
like, hey, could you make an answer for this, make an answer for this and make it?

1461
02:23:36.24 --> 02:23:39.76
Yeah, you're just starting to realize it. Maybe they had a reason for that. We'll just say

1462
02:23:39.76 --> 02:23:45.20

1484
02:25:44.88 --> 02:25:52.64
warfare. I'm going to explain what it is again. There's no problem for me. It is an album. Not a

1485
02:25:52.64 --> 02:25:59.52
musical. It's a spoken word album with tracks. And these tracks are for they ever were a purpose.

1486
02:25:59.52 --> 02:26:04.88
Not just entertainment. Like, oh, this is poetic. It is poetic. But that's not the purpose.

1487
02:26:06.32 --> 02:26:10.64
The purpose is for each track is to get you through. When you're on the path on the campaign

1488

02:28:34.16 --> 02:28:39.84
book for all children. Right. Is there any children? Is there any child in the world that doesn't

1512
02:28:39.84 --> 02:28:46.72
need way the warrior kid? No. Didn't think so. So get that and speaking of way the warrior kid

1513
02:28:46.72 --> 02:28:53.84
there's a new way of the warrior kid that is out right now available for preorder. So

1514
02:28:53.84 --> 02:29:00.96
get it and one of the things that I would like to do. Everyone tells me things like

1515
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:05.36
everyone should get way the warrior kid. Every kid should read this book. Every kid should read

1516
02:29:05.36 --> 02:29:09.92
this book and high school or in their school. People say that to me all the time.

1517
02:29:10.80 --> 02:29:17.44
Because it's very simple clear lessons that everybody should absorb. And it would help. It would

1518
02:29:17.44 --> 02:29:22.48
help me if I had that book. It would help everybody when they had that book and they were younger.

1519
02:29:22.48 --> 02:29:28.72
So want to get this book out there in to more kids. One of the best ways to do that. If you order

1520
02:29:28.72 --> 02:29:36.16
way the warrior kid to marks mission, order it from different sources. Get it from Amazon,

1521
02:29:36.16 --> 02:29:41.12
get it from Barnes Noble, go to your local bookstore and say, hey, can you please order this book

1522
02:29:41.12 --> 02:29:50.16
for me? We want to get it spread out where a bunch of different outlets are seeing the demand for it.

1523
02:29:50.16 --> 02:29:57.12
That will increase the publicity that the book receives and it will get into more kids hands.

1524
02:29:57.12 --> 02:30:02.96
That's my goal is to get more kids to read. Way the warrior kid and to read Mark's mission.

1525
02:30:03.68 --> 02:30:12.16
So do that. It's live. I'll also speak in a warrior kid. If you want to support a warrior

1526
02:30:12.16 --> 02:30:18.16
kid, there's a warrior kid that's a farmer and a businessman. And he's making soap from goat milk.

1527
02:30:18.16 --> 02:30:24.32
Why? Because he's getting after it. You can order some of that at irishokes ranch.com

1528
02:30:24.32 --> 02:30:28.96
and the motto because he makes he doesn't just make soap. He makes jacos soap. Sure. Yeah.

1529
02:30:28.96 --> 02:30:35.20
Hey, he wanted to make good soap. I quote, I want to make good soap. G-O-O-D capitalized.

1530
02:30:36.40 --> 02:30:40.56
So he makes jacos soap. Smells like coconut, by the way. Really?

1531
02:30:40.56 --> 02:30:45.36
Yeah, because I like the smell of coconut. Yeah, is there coconut in it? Here's I didn't find it

1532
02:30:45.36 --> 02:30:49.60
to smell like coconut. It smells, it's the old. You don't think it smells like coconut? Well, maybe

1533
02:30:49.60 --> 02:30:56.08
you have a more sensitive Hawaiian. Yeah, old factory. Old factory sense situation. Yeah. But

1534
02:30:57.28 --> 02:31:05.20
the motto for jacos soap. Stakely. Just funny goes freedom, field manual. Again, you know,

1535
02:31:05.20 --> 02:31:09.44
I was traveling around. I signed a lot of these books and I just traveled around when I was

1536
02:31:09.44 --> 02:31:13.12
in Australia. A lot of people brought it in and that was awesome. A lot of great feedback.

1537
02:31:13.12 --> 02:31:17.36
One thing that's good, if you have that book and you like it and it's helped you,

1538
02:31:17.36 --> 02:31:21.12
get it for someone else that you know that that wants to get on the path or should be on the path.

1539
02:31:21.12 --> 02:31:28.32
So that's pretty easy to do. Also the audio version of that book does not exist on audible.com.

1540
02:31:29.12 --> 02:31:34.24
It exists on iTunes. Amazon, use a Google Play, other MP3 platforms.

1541
02:31:36.16 --> 02:31:41.84
It's an album with tracks. That's why we did it that way. And finally, of course, extreme ownership,

1542
02:31:41.84 --> 02:31:48.48
the new version of extreme ownership is out. The black one, which looks cool. It's got a little

1543
02:31:48.48 --> 02:31:56.48
excerpt, new beginning. It's got an excerpt of Q&A from this podcast in the back, which is solid.

1544
02:31:56.48 --> 02:32:00.72
How long is that part of it? I don't want to say, I mean, how much do you think is there's eight

1545
02:32:00.72 --> 02:32:07.12
questions? I mean, and there, you know, answers, which is pretty robust. And it's fairly robust. Yeah.

1546
02:32:07.12 --> 02:32:15.52
Yeah. And speaking of leadership, we have a company, echelon front. We solve problems

1547
02:32:15.52 --> 02:32:19.12
through leadership. That's what we do. And we do it all the time. It's me,

1561
02:33:39.60 --> 02:33:45.44
deep. He's on the path. Yeah. The podcast is called Use the Way. Yep. Oh, that's good. Yeah.

1562
02:33:45.44 --> 02:33:52.32
Remember the way which is. Wait till you see the logo. Yeah. Yeah. So you can get that wherever

1563
02:33:53.20 --> 02:34:01.60
MP3 or sorry podcasts are available. I've listened to the first episode. You talk about

1564
02:34:01.60 --> 02:34:07.04
getting after it. Oh, yeah. And yeah, you talk about how to get through a lot of things. So it's

1565
02:34:07.04 --> 02:34:14.000
it's awesome. Can I add to that? I'm, it's kind of an advice style podcast right now, or people

1566
02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:19.20
ask me questions. So all those people listen to this. You know, you're sending question after

1567
02:34:19.20 --> 02:34:27.84
question to Jockawilik. He just refuses to answer. He reads it and then just throws it in the track.

1568
02:34:27.84 --> 02:34:35.20
No, just kidding. But yeah, if anybody has questions that they want to get answered by me,

1569

1572
02:34:53.04 --> 02:34:59.04
email that I give out first stuff like this. It also helps to keep it kind of separated.

1573
02:34:59.04 --> 02:35:02.72
So yeah, all my questions I can just check it out. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You're going to have to

1574
02:35:02.72 --> 02:35:07.60
shift. Yeah. I have to shift. Oh, I have to shift. Dang. Yeah. I got to learn that. Listen to

1575
02:35:07.60 --> 02:35:15.04
a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I miss anything else from your various platforms. Oh, I mean,

1576
02:35:15.04 --> 02:35:23.44
I am working on a book, too. Oh, awesome. It's there's no real, uh, you know, date to release data

1577
02:35:23.44 --> 02:35:32.64
anything, but I'm hoping it's going to be a book about veterans and the positive and just continuing

1578
02:35:32.64 --> 02:35:38.24
to create that story that I was talking about earlier about, just telling that side of the coin

1579
02:35:38.24 --> 02:35:43.76
about veterans that come home and are fine. Yeah. And I'm hoping it's going to be right now. I'm

1580
02:35:43.76 --> 02:35:53.68
kind of making it kind of like you ever read anything by by Play-Doh. Oh, yeah. I just like basically

1581
02:35:53.68 --> 02:35:59.20
all of his writing is conversation that Socrates had. So I'm hoping I'm going to make it kind of

1582
02:35:59.20 --> 02:36:03.84
like that where it's just basically this series of conversations between two people. You know what's

1583
02:36:03.84 --> 02:36:06.88
and this I just thought this while you were saying this because I think this is another important

1584
02:36:06.88 --> 02:36:13.60
thing about on that exact subject. And we were talking earlier about these two categories of

1585
02:36:13.60 --> 02:36:18.000
like the vet comes that that comes home and he's good in the vet that comes home and he's a little

1586
02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:23.44
little a little bit off track. Yeah. But I would like to say and and I know you're going to agree with

1587
02:36:23.44 --> 02:36:27.52
this 100%. Just because you're a little bit off track doesn't mean you're going to get you can't

1588
02:36:27.52 --> 02:36:32.64
easily get back on track or the I've known all kinds of veterans that they were off track a little

1589
02:36:32.64 --> 02:36:36.64
bit for a little while and then they figured out and they get back on track. They find a new mission.

1590
02:36:36.64 --> 02:36:42.80
So, you know, the guys and that's actually fairly common in my in my from what I've seen and actually

1591
02:36:42.80 --> 02:36:49.68
talking a lot of guys that that went through Vietnam and they'd come home from Vietnam and they

1592
02:36:49.68 --> 02:36:55.20
were a little messed up when they got home, you know, and they got through it, got over it,

1593
02:36:55.20 --> 02:36:58.64
and got it out of their system and moved on. And again, we've talked about I've talked about this

1594
02:36:58.64 --> 02:37:02.40
before, you know, when you got done with World War II, you sat on a ship with a bunch of other

1595
02:37:02.40 --> 02:37:07.36
vets for six weeks and you debriefed everything on a ride home and you got that out of your system

1596
02:37:07.36 --> 02:37:12.48
and you got to communicate and you got you moved through it mentally. Vietnam, they didn't have

1597
02:37:12.48 --> 02:37:16.88
that opportunity Vietnam. It was, oh yeah, you're in Vietnam today and then tomorrow you're in San Francisco,

1598
02:37:16.88 --> 02:37:21.52
alone, by the way, you're not with anybody else. You're not with any other veterans. Nowadays,

1599
02:37:21.52 --> 02:37:26.000
we do a pretty good job of when you come home, you're coming home with your unit, you stay together,

1600
02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:30.96
you have people to talk to that have the common experience. But yeah, to the vets out there that are

1601
02:37:30.96 --> 02:37:34.72
thinking, oh man, I feel like I might be one of those guys that's not on the right track right now.

1602
02:37:35.44 --> 02:37:40.96
You can get back on the right track and it's it's finding your new mission and moving down that path

1603
02:37:40.96 --> 02:37:45.52
towards towards achieving it and just try and everything that you possibly can. Like for me,

1604
02:37:45.52 --> 02:37:51.76
it's easy to figure out what I needed to do because there was a system in place and it's a obvious

1605
02:37:51.76 --> 02:37:56.56
physical injury but with the mental injuries we don't exactly know how to fix them yet, but

1606
02:37:56.56 --> 02:38:00.80
you just have to keep trying this. All right, dry talking about with their vests, didn't work, all right,

1607
02:38:00.80 --> 02:38:05.04
I try, you know, hyperbolic chambers or whatever, try this, try that, try that,

1608
02:38:05.04 --> 02:38:10.08
and because just because you tried one thing and it didn't work out doesn't mean that you don't want to,

1609
02:38:11.28 --> 02:38:17.52
that doesn't mean that you now are fine with, you know, nightmares and stuff you just got to keep

1610
02:38:17.52 --> 02:38:21.60
trying everything until everything is exhausted. Yeah, and I'll tell you, I've, I've

1611
02:38:22.80 --> 02:38:28.72
in talking to Jordan Peterson, the couple times we've had him out here, into listening to him,

1612
02:38:28.72 --> 02:38:35.52
in reading his book, it's become very obvious to me and it's sort of reflective of something

1613
02:38:35.52 --> 02:38:42.88
that Dakota Meyer said on the podcast, which is like, hey, your brain, your mentality, your

1614
02:38:42.88 --> 02:38:47.60
psychology is a system and just like, just like you have a system to move through and you have

1615
02:38:47.60 --> 02:38:53.36
a physical injury to get healed or get corrected. Well, this is the same thing with your

1616
02:38:53.36 --> 02:38:58.40
psychological state and if that psychological state is off a little bit, well there's things that

1617
02:38:58.40 --> 02:39:02.88
there's people that know how to fix it. If you listen to when Jordan's talking about the way that

1618
02:39:02.88 --> 02:39:08.48
he would bring someone through a problem, there's a systematic way to do that. And I never really

1619
02:39:08.48 --> 02:39:13.12
understood that until I started listening to him because when they'd send us to the psychologist

1620
02:39:13.12 --> 02:39:19.76
to debrief a deployment, you know, for me it was just sort of, you know, I had the negative attitude

1621
02:39:19.76 --> 02:39:23.20
of all this, I'm not going to tell this guy anything because I don't want them to think I'm

1622
02:39:23.20 --> 02:39:29.04
crazy and I don't want to get, you know, put on whatever, you know, thing. And so I just was, hey,

1623
02:39:29.04 --> 02:39:33.84
I'm just going to move forward. And that's the worst sort of my eye, I didn't, and I'll tell you

1624
02:39:33.84 --> 02:39:38.08
when I was in, that was a very common attitude. Was, hey, look, I'm not going to tell this

1625
02:39:38.08 --> 02:39:42.40
psychologist does know what I've been through. So I'm not going to tell him anything. That was

1626
02:39:42.40 --> 02:39:49.12
a very common. And again, I think for me listening to Jordan because I would have been, you know,

1627
02:39:49.12 --> 02:39:55.52
two years ago or a year ago before I started listening to Jordan Peterson talk, I never really

1628
02:39:55.52 --> 02:39:59.76
saw the connection. And then it really solidified it when I heard Dakota talking about it saying,

1629
02:39:59.76 --> 02:40:05.28
look, this is a, I put the two and two together when I heard Dakota talking about it, like,

1630
02:40:05.28 --> 02:40:11.60
there's people just like if you wanted to get good at Olympic lifting, you'd go to an Olympic,

1631
02:40:11.60 --> 02:40:16.08
if you tried to figure that out on your own, it would take you forever and you might get hurt,

1632
02:40:16.08 --> 02:40:21.04
you might get hurt worse. Whereas if you went to a real Olympic lifting coach and said, hey,

1633
02:40:21.04 --> 02:40:24.88
I want to learn the clean and jerk in the snatch, they would say, okay, here's where we're going to

1634
02:40:24.88 --> 02:40:27.28
start. We're going to start with the PVC pipe and then we're going to go through the motions. They're

1635
02:40:27.28 --> 02:40:30.08
going to get better at this. And then we're going to do high poles. They're going to walk you through

1636
02:40:30.08 --> 02:40:36.16
the whole system. And a psychologist will do that with your brain. They'll say, oh, okay, I see what

1637
02:40:36.16 --> 02:40:40.40
you're scared of needles as the, the example Jordan Peterson again. Here's what we're going to do to

1638
02:40:40.40 --> 02:40:44.40
get you used to needles. Well, when you come back from a traumatic event, here's some things that we

1639
02:40:44.40 --> 02:40:49.44
can do to revisit that. And I think the same thing that you talked about earlier with like movies,

1640
02:40:50.24 --> 02:40:55.28
I think that part of my prejudice against psychologists came from the way that they're portrayed in

1641
02:40:55.28 --> 02:41:02.32
movies as being like, you know, sitting on this couch and like these weird people that, you know,

1642
02:41:02.32 --> 02:41:06.48
and it's not, it's more pragmatic than that. These it seems that way to me. So,

1643
02:41:06.48 --> 02:41:11.04
look at trainer kind of alertly. Yeah, you have a trainer or more like a more like a coach, right?

1644
02:41:11.04 --> 02:41:14.16
Yeah, more like a coach or more like a jiu-jitsu instructor. Yeah, that's saying like, hey,

1645
02:41:14.16 --> 02:41:17.84
here's what you need to do here. You call this position. Here's what you need to do. The psychologist says,

1646
02:41:17.84 --> 02:41:24.000
oh, you're having, you're having bad dreams about this. Okay, let's try these things. I don't know what

1647
02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:28.16
those things are because I don't know, not a psychologist, but they do know. Yeah. They do know what

1648
02:41:28.16 --> 02:41:31.84
to tell you to do. And they do know how to help you get through those things. And just like

1649
02:41:31.84 --> 02:41:36.24
jiu-jitsu or just like athletic training or just like Olympic lifting, it's going to vary

1650
02:41:36.24 --> 02:41:43.68
for different people and a good psychological coach is going to have a know how to make those adjustments.

1651
02:41:43.68 --> 02:41:46.96
And say, oh, you're feeling this a little bit more. Oh, it's because you came from this kind of family.

1652
02:41:46.96 --> 02:41:50.48
So, this is what's going to help you. But you came from a different family. So, this is going to

1653
02:41:50.48 --> 02:41:54.88
help you a little different way. So, I think those things are important to think about. And again,

1654
02:41:54.88 --> 02:42:00.08
I just wanted to re-emphasize the point that just because you might be in a rut as a,

1655
02:42:00.08 --> 02:42:06.48
either as a vet or just as a human being, you know, there's every little decision you make.

1656
02:42:06.48 --> 02:42:12.64
You can start moving in the right direction and moving towards a better place in your life and

1657
02:42:12.64 --> 02:42:17.92
everything that you're doing. So, just wanted to bring that out. Echo, you got any other anything else?

1658
02:42:18.88 --> 02:42:24.64
All good. Good to see you again. Well, man, so it's so awesome to be here. Just be included among

1659
02:42:24.64 --> 02:42:30.48
the people that you guys deem worthy of, you know, takes a long time to do this. It takes a lot of

1660
02:42:30.48 --> 02:42:37.12
preparation. And it's just for you guys to take that time and spend it on preparing to have me as

1661
02:42:37.12 --> 02:42:41.52
a guest. It's a huge compliment. You're generous. You're generous. You're generous. You're generous.

1662
02:42:41.52 --> 02:42:46.16
For us, do you got any other closing thoughts? Yeah, I just want to point out that, you know,

1663
02:42:46.16 --> 02:42:53.52
on the one here in the hot seat. And I'm getting all the accolades. And, but, you know, I didn't,

1664
02:42:53.52 --> 02:42:59.84
I didn't do anything that I've accomplished without people help me. I like to, it's kind of like a

1665
02:42:59.84 --> 02:43:04.80
pyramid. Like, I'm the tip of the pyramid. I'm like the thing that everybody likes to see.

1666
02:43:04.80 --> 02:43:10.96
That's the top of the pyramid. But there's a whole gigantic base underneath this pyramid that

1667
02:43:10.96 --> 02:43:16.24
if the tip didn't have it, then the tip would just be a stupid rock. And so, you know, I

1668
02:43:17.84 --> 02:43:22.24
all the way since my recovery, you know, I've had supporting people and my family and

1669
02:43:22.24 --> 02:43:29.12
especially on this month of marathon, I just did it. If my wife hadn't been there, if Pam hadn't

1670
02:43:29.12 --> 02:43:35.04
been there, then it's not happening at all. I mean, there's some things that I could say,

1671
02:43:35.04 --> 02:43:39.20
you know, I could have done it, but it wouldn't have been as good, but this thing would not have

1672
02:43:39.20 --> 02:43:46.08
happened without her. See, I mean, I totally gave her the reins. I, you know, I set it up and if there

1673
02:43:46.08 --> 02:43:52.56
was any question she had about overall, you know, vision for what I was trying to accomplish, she would

1674
02:43:52.56 --> 02:44:00.40
ask me, but like when we had a couple hiccups along the way, and I just totally 100% trusted her

1675
02:44:00.40 --> 02:44:07.52
that she'd be able to take care of it, and she did every single time. And she, I'm sure I'm not

1676
02:44:07.52 --> 02:44:11.12
given even enough credit. I don't, I'm just, there's probably a thousand things that she did. I don't

1677
02:44:11.12 --> 02:44:18.56
even know about yet. But I mean, I just owe her a huge, and then also my mom, the same thing,

1678
02:44:18.56 --> 02:44:26.56
you know, just being willing to withstand a month in an RV with four people, you know, and probably

1679
02:44:26.56 --> 02:44:30.80
putting up with me being grumpy, whatever, and you know, and pain and stuff, and I couldn't have

1680
02:44:30.80 --> 02:44:38.000
imagined having, you know, two people along with me that that would have made it better, or that

1681
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:43.92
I would have trusted as much, and then also my buddy that drove, and then just all the people that

1682
02:44:43.92 --> 02:44:50.80
kept me going that ran with me, and, you know, deemed me worthy of their time, and the people

1683
02:44:50.80 --> 02:44:57.52
that sent me messages of encouragement that couldn't make it out. I just owe everybody a huge

1684
02:44:57.52 --> 02:45:04.88
debt of gratitude, and I'm going to do my best to continue to keep fighting and earn that respect,

1685
02:45:04.88 --> 02:45:10.000
and earn that earn their effort, earn their sacrifices as much as I can.

1686
02:45:11.04 --> 02:45:17.12
Awesome. Well, obviously Rob, it's an honor to have you back on here again. I look forward to

1687
02:45:17.12 --> 02:45:21.04
whatever the hell kind of crazy thing. You do next. I'm not sure what it's going to be, but I'm

1688
02:45:21.04 --> 02:45:28.08
sure it'll be something awesome. And of course, thanks to everyone for listening to this podcast,

1689
02:45:28.08 --> 02:45:35.60
thanks to the service men and women that are holding the line day and night, day and night,

1690
02:45:37.60 --> 02:45:44.56
fighting against evil, thanks to police law enforcement firefighters, paramedics,

1691
02:45:44.56 --> 02:45:54.72
other first responders that are always on call, always on call, to protect us here at home, and to

1692
02:45:54.72 --> 02:46:02.96
it, everyone that's listening, I want to refer to one last journal entry that Rob wrote

1693
02:46:04.40 --> 02:46:10.48
in something that we talked about the last time that he was on, that that was using the weight

1694
02:46:12.08 --> 02:46:21.92
because the weight of the world can be heavy. The weight of the challenges and the trials of life

1695
02:46:21.92 --> 02:46:31.84
can drive you into the ground and that weight can wear you down and break you.

1696
02:46:34.40 --> 02:46:41.52
But instead of letting the weight wear you down instead of letting the weight break you,

1697
02:46:41.52 --> 02:46:51.20
you can use the weight to make yourself stronger to make yourself tougher to make yourself

1698
02:46:51.20 --> 02:47:01.20
better. And that is what I recommend everyone does just like Rob says,

1699
02:47:03.12 --> 02:47:18.64
use the weight. Now get out there and get after it. And until next time, this is Rob Jones

1700
02:47:18.64 --> 02:47:23.60
and Echo and Jocco out.
