and how you say he's stepping out of line and that's what it is it's like you're you're stepping slightly outside of like the mutual like respectful agreement of this friendly like training slash competition and the other thing is you gotta remember is like when I roll with Andy like man we're smashing each other I mean it's full he's you know we're we'll do whatever like it's full we might as well be competing for you know the world championships because if there's a chance where he's trying to choke me and I've got my chin down he'll he'll choke my face but you see what I say won't damage the relationship in any way you know like I feel like like you can kind of take these kinds of things so it's almost like I'm in like a little free arena I believe me that's it's a good thing I feel what I'm saying is I feel comfortable to just be like you know F u or whatever I find sneak attacks on the GG2 map and I think it's just so important to think about these things especially a guy that's controversial like paton you know there's there's another quote about paton you know because they called paton old blood guts and there's there's a quote about paton that someone else said it was our blood his guts you know so there's some like that's a rough statement right that's a rough statement so there's controversy you know around paton there's controversy about some of the things that he did you know there's the whole episode of him slapping around some of the guys that had left the front lines for various reasons that were not ham physically wounded so some of the guys had some mental trauma you know whether they were shell shocked and what's interesting about this is this is this is one of I'm sure we can get into but I'm reading another book written by a by a leader in World War II yeah like deep deep in golfing frustration there was always like a little governor on there where it's like even like my expressions of frustration like there's always a hint of like joke in there like to genuine but whatever saying it's on this side of the spectrum a lot of the time and then on the other side it's like I don't know something like super deep that not many people know about but the people who do know about it it's like man that's my life song kind of thing you know I've had a couple people do it over the years like you know like tap someone out and like hey we were over by the wall and like kind of just turn my back to start going back towards the center and have someone jump on my back and like put a choking yeah like good first right for the breakup but a lot of artists I mean from what I understand they don't necessarily know how to like draw that good it's more of just they're like the idea behind the result kind of thing you know hey you know the invoke like everything in them you know that's a good point too because like with some of the old like punk rock bands that really like had a big impact it wasn't because they were good musicians it's because their emotion emotionally raw right so like one time he was like it was an ongoing scramble I don't know if he was on purpose going outside of the mat like outside of the door he kind of did like to escape you know the old school art right that real valuable art like you know Picasso and others then you have these master foragers where are they on this whole thing maybe like I mean I think they're like the technical guitarist that can lay down the riff exactly you can't tell the difference like hey I probably should have said that to this guy too like just being like hey man if you get crazy with people they might get crazy with you what you want to do is try and learn and try to have a good time this isn't actual combat we're just having fun we're trying to learn so if you should you should really go with that approach you know that's smart that's a smart and we said talk about this before where you're so like you can take kind of anything you know like if I cheat with you like my straight up like you're rolling with any and they can achieve a good level but the people that can go next level are the people that can take those things and apply them in different ways different situations different scenarios and then create things out of it that's the difference between or not even but up this is I think someone can be just a good applyer and be a world champion in jjitsu like someone that studies and is great and knows the moves they can be a world champion but to be like the elite of the elite you got to have that next level you got to be able to take those things and apply create next level and actually I did say that to them and they sent me a bunch of other books it said hey here's like this is what books like look like over here your book will not look like a book I got a bunch of books leaders of strategy and tactics field manual thank you all spread the word writer review on amazon and then get way the warrior kid the whole series one two and three marks mission where there's a will and way the warrior kid Mikey the dragons for the little kid discipline equals freedom field manual for the older kid that needs to be on the path the audio version of that is on MP3 platforms as well and then of course extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership that is the books I wrote with my brother Dave babin laying out the principles of leadership that will help you in business and life and if you need more help than that we have echelon front which are leadership consultancy where we solve problems through leadership you're going to echelon front dot com for that e f on line that's echelon front online leadership training because leadership is not an inoculation we got the muster coming up in 2019 where we're going to be we're going to be in Orlando we're going to be in Dallas and we're going to be in phoenix Arizona go to extremo ownership dot com everyone of these that we have done has sold out these are going to sell out too well and that's what they stress doesn't it doesn't stress the inspirational qualities of the general doesn't stress that because he focuses on the fact that the guy was educated or the guy went to Oxford or the guy went to whatever west point is that because it's it's more concrete it's definitely more concrete but it's also it's a shared value it's like what you just said you know this guy was smart like when somebody does something when when another seal does something cool I'm like but it was like joking you know sometimes people do that like serious you know like you're hitting the mop in the corner and there's still a drain of go Yeah, or even like if you, and not that this would happen all the time or whatever, I don't know, but like if you just tips over or something, and it's like, oh, we got to get out of here I think my hypothesis that'll never be categorized beyond hypothesis I think I don't think you can make a viral video like like that like you can't know after you I like first person accounts I actually like first person accounts as often as I came from like the front line soldiers of course I like the general stew and the card kernels that's great well it kind of makes sense if you consider the concept right you know like you know some cars here like if they're super exotic they'll have the steering wheel on the other side of the road or the other side of the the car it'll be on the right side but it's like I don't know like is it reaching everybody well definitely not reaching anybody everybody I posted up there was some got there was like a bunch of bump of bumps I mean bumps in San Diego I was out for dinner so if you want to come and you want to bring your team go there now extremo ownership dot com and we have e f over watching e f legion

subscribe and he says this truly in war men are nothing a man is everything in acquiring a tradition we must live on not in our studies so in order to require great knowledge you you have to you have to live on the studies not in them we must guard against becoming so engrossed in a specific nature of the roots on bark of the trees of knowledge as to miss the meaning and grandeur of the forest that they compose that's a really complicated way of saying don't miss the forest through the trees it fails the simplicity as has been pointed out the secret of victory lies not holy in knowledge it lurks invisible in that vitalizing spark intangible yet as evident as lightning the warrior soul that's where he's in the victory lies the warrior soul we shall now seek to evaluate and place in their just ratio the three essentials to victory inspiration knowledge and force which he also calls mass we may therefore postulate that no one element be its soul knowledge or mass is dominant that a combination of any two of these factors gives a strong presumption of success over an adversary relying on one alone and that the three combined are practically invincible against a combination of the other two so here's the important things inspiration knowledge and and force or mass and he actually I'm not covered in now but he gives some examples of where these things were important through history I'm not going to cover them right now but these three things are what you need for victory he says man cannot live by bread alone and that as a man thinketh or you know so it's like their whole attitude towards any competition is like crush you kill you like you're my enemy kind of thing and I talk about it in leadership strategy and tactics and that's this if if your goal is to take care of yourself everyone can see it you're going to fail that's the way it is like if your goal if you're if you're willing to step on people and cross them in order to move up the chain of command everyone's going to see it and you're going to fail now look you might get a couple wins here and there I get it but long term you're going to fail if your goal is to take care of your team and accomplish the mission that's what your true goal is number one you're going to be successful in taking care of the team and successful in accomplish the mission and then guess what a by-product is you will be successful as well but the minute you say well wait a second but no no you never know what that next episode's gonna bring I do know this I did some live gigs around America sure they're they're over now when this podcast comes out the last two were Seattle and San Francisco which both sold out which was awesome so to everyone that went to the jockel live shows around the country thank you and for everyone that's asked for more looks like I'm gonna do some more so jockel live we'll put that out soon on when these next ones will happen and the other thing is the leadership strategy tactics and feel manual that I talked about today a couple times and just just want to say thanks to everybody it's it's been crazy that the sales have been great and he goes deep you know with his music like what he's saying Derek's and something like whatever and he and so we're talking about it like what's better music and he's saying that in order to be a really good leader he have to be bloodline incarnate in Europe but then he says this which is awesome this is where I get a little you know he started to move a little bit out of the box here then he comes right back in the box and I had a paraphrase this one a little bit but nor is the suggestion that birth is the only means of producing such a leader there are certainly born leaders but the soldier may still overcome his natal defects by unremitting effort and practice imagine that what's that the only traverses that's what it is that's what it is I've got a book called Leadership Strategy in Tactics there's this there's a chapter in there called born or mate and the answer is both and that's the same thing that general patency in here you look you can be born a great leader right like I don't know maybe what you're bringing spirit something like this you know some of this thing pretty deep so I got on top and just like mounted and like punished him with neon stomach or something like that is that is that bad you know And sometimes when I read about patent, if you know about patent, and you know about his career and you know what happened to him, sometimes you, it hurts a little bit to know that this guy who was such a great patriot, who was such a great tactician, that if he could have applied some of his principles of leadership on the battlefield, if he could have applied those to his interactions with other people, he might have ended up in a much better position. but but I used the measurement tools like okay how many albums have you know you guys sold like or how are we going to measure you know but then you gotta be able to execute continuing on since the historian through lack of experience and consequent appreciation of the inspirational qualities of generals fails to stress them he does emphasize their mental gifts which since he shares he values this guy was smart like me this guy was educated like me that's what made him so great just like me and I put a real choke in make you tap or whatever I feel like you can like take that you know like you won't be all mad at me not externally anyway and you figure we're maneuvering your people and you think what you've read about but you forget about the thing that I try to talk about all the time which is human nature which is understanding people understanding people understanding hunger emotion personality fatigue leadership and always imponderable things those are what you need to be concerned about as a leader going on obsessed with admiration for the intelligence which history is ascribed to leaders past he forgets the inseparable connection between plans the flower of the intellect and execution the fruit of the soul he's getting an A plus an in English class right now isn't it the inseparable connection between plans which are the flower of the intellect and execution the fruit of the soul you gotta have both you gotta have both and I know that's all because you all are out there getting after it's spread in the word made it number one and a bunch of different a bunch of different outlets that actually measure this stuff so believe me that every time I think about that I think about everyone that that listens to this podcast and that spread the word and you know bought yourself a first of this and by the way there was some controversy someone sent a picture on social media and that cover was different and said you know I waited as too long everybody you know people like are you we back in the day when I was a personal trainer and you get a personal trainer who's like an out of shape you know
