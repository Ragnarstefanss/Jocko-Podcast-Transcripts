00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is Jocco podcast number 23 with Echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good evening Echo.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Good evening.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Better.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And faster and stronger and smarter and wiser.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Always trying to get a little bit of all those things.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And we try and get wiser.

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That's one of those things.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That's wisdom, which technically wisdom comes from experience.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So how do you garner experience?

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You can't just make yourself live longer in a shorter period of time.

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It doesn't work that way.

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So what do we do to garner wisdom?

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We look to the past.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You got to know your past.

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You got to know history.

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And as I tell my son on a pretty regular basis,

18
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
history revolves around war.

19
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And in many ways history is war.

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And war is a human endeavor.

21
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The worst of human endeavors, but it is a human endeavor nonetheless.

22
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And because it is a human endeavor,

23
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
therefore reflects human nature.

24
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And that's why we can learn so much from the history of war.

25
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Not just about war itself.

26
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But about man.

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And about human nature.

28
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And the same goes for principles of war.

29
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The principles of war can be applied to life.

30
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Can be applied to business.

31
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Can be applied to relationships.

32
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Can be applied to every human endeavor.

33
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And so with that in mind, that full spectrum of application.

34
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Let's take a look at the oldest book about the principles of war.

35
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Written in 500 BC over 2,500 years ago.

36
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
A book whose principles still apply today.

37
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Sunsoes, the art of war.

38
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Sunsoes said,

39
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
the art of war is a vital importance to the state.

40
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It is a matter of life and death.

41
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
A road either to safety or to ruin.

42
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can, on no account, be neglected.

43
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
You got to study war.

44
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And like I said, it is really about life in conflict, in friction, in relationships.

45
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And human interaction, you're going to see all that.

46
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
When you start looking at the art of war.

47
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And he starts talking about trying to figure out who's going to win in a situation.

48
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:56.000
When seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison in this wise.

49
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Which of the two generals has most ability?

50
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?

51
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Which army is stronger?

52
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
On which side are officers and men most highly trained?

53
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.000
In which army is their greater constancy in both reward and punishment?

54
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
That's something you talked about.

55
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Echo Charles and we're talking about kids.

56
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
You've talked about how it's important for the punishment to be constant and consistent.

57
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Now yes, now what's interesting here.

58
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And this is something we've talked about before.

59
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And you know what I'm going to say that a lot today.

60
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
This is something we've talked about before.

61
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Because when you start talking about military strategy, it runs through the ages.

62
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
There's threads that run through the ages.

63
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
This is one of them.

64
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
He says, while heating the profit of my council,

65
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:07.000
avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.

66
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
According as circumstances are favorable, one you should modify one's plans.

67
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So don't get dead set on something.

68
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Don't get locked into a plan.

69
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
You gotta be open to change it.

70
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Continuing, all warfare is based on deception.

71
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable.

72
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
When using our forces, we must seem inactive.

73
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
When we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are away.

74
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
When far away, we must make and believe we are near.

75
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Hold out baits to entice the enemy,

76
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
fain disorder and crush him.

77
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Now this is something that applies absolutely directly to Jiu Jitsu, obviously.

78
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
You know, oh, oh, you think you're going to get my arm?

79
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Boom, I just swept you and got on top.

80
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Oh, I'm really panicking this situation.

81
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Oh, guess what?

82
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I just got a deep half guard came out the back and now I'm going to choke you.

83
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Back to the book.

84
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
If he is secured, all points be prepared for him.

85
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
If he is superior in strength, evade him.

86
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
If your opponent is of caleric temper, seek to irritate him.

87
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Pretend to be weak that he may grow arrogant.

88
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So this is something people don't think about.

89
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
In fact, that hey, if your opponent has superior strength, evade him.

90
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And obviously, that's something that we also heard from Mal.

91
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
The same, that was the same guerilla strategy.

92
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
If your opponent is strong, you avoid him.

93
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And here we say, if they're losing their temper a little bit, go ahead and irritate him.

94
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Help that long.

95
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Pretend to be weak so that your opponent grows arrogant.

96
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And thinks there's enough to worry about you.

97
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Continuing, if he is taking his ease, give him no rest.

98
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
If his forces are united, separate them, attack him where he's unprepared.

99
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
A peer where you are not expected.

100
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000
These military devices leading to victory must not be divulged beforehand.

101
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It's strange that this is the oldest book, and this thread runs throughout history.

102
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And yet, people interacting with each other will constantly decide they're just going to go, you know, toe to toe.

103
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
You're going to argue with me, cool, I'm just going to go toe to toe with you.

104
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Yeah, this is an intellectual approach.

105
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And I think that's, you know, if you're not detached, it's harder to jump on that intellectual methodology.

106
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Yes, with you, if you come at me, with your argument head on or you accuse me,

107
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
or you're trying to tighten me up on something, you're just being super direct with me.

108
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
It's your right.

109
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I might get offended in the way I'm going to do, I'm going to go right back at you.

110
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Right.

111
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Instead of maneuvering on you.

112
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Right.

113
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So like, if someone's super smart or super calculated, they're way more likely to sign onto this type of stuff.

114
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So as you start losing your temper with someone, think about what echo Charles just said,

115
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that means you're not being very smart, you're not being very calculated.

116
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It means you're making a mistake. You know, means there's a better route to go.

117
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Yep.

118
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Now, continuing.

119
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Now, the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple, air the battle is fought.

120
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.

121
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So you got a plan.

122
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And it's, it's interesting, you use the word calculate, calculate of,

123
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and he just used the same word.

124
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Now, this is something that I've talked about.

125
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
To fight in conquer and all your battles is not supreme excellence.

126
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I'll say that again, to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence.

127
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.

128
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And I always take that one step further. I always take it to the point that the enemy doesn't even know that there was a fight.

129
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
They didn't even know what was happening. They thought they were having dinner and going to sleep, but they just got beat.

130
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And that's especially true when you're part of a team and you're trying to win some,

131
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
you're trying to push your idea through, you're trying to convince people of something.

132
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
The best way to convince them is when you didn't go that toe to toe with them,

133
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
they came to the conclusion themselves, at least they think they did.

134
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
You fought them without fighting them.

135
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Thus, the highest form of general ship is to block the enemy's plans.

136
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
The next best is to prevent the junction of enemy forces.

137
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field.

138
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And the worst policy of all is to besieged walled cities.

139
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000
The rule is not to besiege wall cities if it can possibly be avoided.

140
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Now, this is another thing.

141
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And I've said this on this podcast before, which is, if someone is super dug in on a position, why are you going to attack him?

142
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
If you have this belief that you're just dug in on, and I'm trying to maneuver around it,

143
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
why am I going to attack that position? You've got, you know more about it, you've studied it.

144
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
You've been in this argument 47 times in the last three weeks.

145
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So, how am I going to come up against you? And you've got that well for the five position.

146
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Yeah, the answer is I'm not. It's not going to work out good for me.

147
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Therefore, the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting.

148
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:18.000
He captures their cities without laying any siege. He overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.

149
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
That's the goal.

150
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
That is the goal.

151
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And that is something else about martial arts.

152
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I think, like, when you get someone that really knows how to fight, most of the time you don't have to fight.

153
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Yeah.

154
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Most of the time, you can tell people can tell that you know how to fight.

155
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Like, for instance, when they get in your face and you smile at him and you go, oh, let's do this.

156
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Then they realize this is not a good idea.

157
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Yeah.

158
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
A little projection of power.

159
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Going on here.

160
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Thus, we may know that there are five essentials for victory.

161
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:06.000
He will win, who knows when to fight and when not to fight.

162
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
This is sort of like when you're doing Napoleon and just about everything in the book.

163
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
You can just stop and think about it.

164
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And it's also sort of like, you're jutsu in that what you've learned.

165
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Once you hear it, it seems super obvious, but why aren't you thinking about all the time?

166
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Right.

167
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And why do you make stupid mistakes that portray that rule?

168
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Because it's not front of your mind.

169
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Right.

170
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Yeah.

171
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Like I said, the two, when you're emotionally charged, it's just handle things way different.

172
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Which kind of ironic in a way, because that's what makes this so effective when people normally handle

173
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
themselves in that emotional way.

174
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Yes.

175
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And that's what if you're yourself in this way, that's the very thing that makes it effective.

176
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Yeah.

177
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And that's what I'm saying, theme to this.

178
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Which hasn't been said.

179
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I mean, he doesn't address this the way I dressed it the way I talk about it in our book, the way we talk about the podcast is the idea that you're talking about, which is the idea of detaching and not being emotional.

180
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
So that you can do things.

181
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
So that you can make good decisions.

182
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Yeah.

183
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Next, he will win, who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.

184
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:26.000
He will win, whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all ranks.

185
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So if you're in a leadership position, you got part of your team on board with the program, not good enough.

186
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
You got to get the whole team on board with the program.

187
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
That's who's going to win.

188
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000
He will win, who prepared himself, prepared himself, weights to take the enemy unrepared.

189
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I'm just going to wait until you're not ready.

190
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Why would I square up?

191
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
You know, why would I do that?

192
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
If you're ready to fight me, we're not going to go.

193
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Let's just wait till you're not expecting it.

194
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Yeah.

195
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Along with any emotional kind of state that some people are in where they don't exercise these types of strategies along with the emotional state is the ego-tistical state.

196
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
You know, the guy was like, hey, I'm just going to stand till it till.

197
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
You're like, all right, that's tough.

198
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000
That might make for a show and fighting MMA situation.

199
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But as far as the strategy to win, that's again.

200
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
It's cool for the show, but there's winning actually winning.

201
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
It might not be the best.

202
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
We'll just say that.

203
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Yeah, I would agree with you.

204
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Number five, he will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.

205
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Victory lies in the knowledge of those five points.

206
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So that means you can't get micromanaged.

207
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
If you're being micromanaged by the higher powers, you're going to have problems.

208
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And here's the classic saying that everyone's heard.

209
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Hence the saying, if you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.

210
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000
If you know yourself, but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you are off also suffer a defeat.

211
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:34.000
If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.

212
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So you've got to know yourself.

213
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
That's your team.

214
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
That's you.

215
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
That's why you've got to learn.

216
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
That's why you've got to study.

217
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
That's why you've got to train.

218
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
That's why you've got to test yourself too.

219
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
That's why you've got to put pressure on yourself.

220
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Because you don't know yourself unless you put yourself into situations.

221
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Physically, mentally, stress.

222
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
That's what you want to go into.

223
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
So that you know yourself.

224
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
When we use to send COP, when we send COP, it turns over.

225
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
They know what their limitations are.

226
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
They've been tested hard individually and as a unit.

227
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Going on.

228
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Sunsu said, and this is actually, that's a quote from the book.

229
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
So I guess he must have wrote that because this is allegedly a literal translation of Sunsu.

230
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And so he starts off his statements with Sunsu said.

231
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
The good fighters of old put first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat.

232
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.

233
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands.

234
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
But the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.

235
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So he's going to talk about that more and it is laced throughout this book.

236
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
That you've got to focus on your game.

237
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
You've got to focus on what you can do in the situation.

238
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Not worried about them, but like what can I do to be prepared?

239
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Hmm.

240
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Put myself beyond the possibility of defeat.

241
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Hence, the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.

242
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Going on.

243
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Sunsu said,

244
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000
The control of a large force is the same in principle as the control of a few men.

245
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
It is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.

246
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Now when I wrote about that and late for night talk about that all the time,

247
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
That's decentralized command.

248
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Dividing up the numbers and having subordinate leadership running the teams and having subordinate leadership inside those teams running smaller teams.

249
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
That's all it is.

250
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
The principle of control is the same.

251
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Now we get into a little bit of direct versus indirect.

252
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Again, a topic that I talk about all the time.

253
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
In all fighting the direct method may be used for joining battle,

254
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
But indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.

255
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as heaven and earth,

256
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Unending as the flow of rivers and streams, like the sun and moon, they end but to begin a new.

257
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Like the four seasons, they pass but to return once more.

258
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
So he's talking about how when you get to indirect tactics, they're infinite numbers.

259
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Infinite numbers of ways to approach things.

260
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
There are not more than five musical notes.

261
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Yet the combination of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.

262
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
There are not more than five primary colors, yet in combination they produce more cues than can ever be seen.

263
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:09.000
There are not more than five cardinal tastes, yet combinations of them yield flavors, more flavors than can ever be tasted.

264
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000
In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack, the direct and indirect.

265
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.

266
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
The direct and indirect lead onto each other in turn.

267
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
It is like a moving circle, you never come to an end.

268
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?

269
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
He went a little, he went descriptive right there.

270
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
He was obviously convinced as I am too.

271
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000
That even though there's basic maneuvers, the way that you apply them is limitless.

272
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
That's one of the things that makes leadership hard.

273
00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Because when you're dealing with people, there's a certain number of types of personalities you got to deal with.

274
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:10.000
But then those personalities are all mixed together in a way that you have to react to them and treat them a certain way.

275
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
They're the same.

276
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Yeah, and then you have to deal with how they interact with each other as well.

277
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And then not to mention the fact that they may or may not change as individuals, as the day goes on.

278
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
As the day goes on, they start getting hungry, they start getting angry.

279
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Right?

280
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Or maybe they just watch the romantic comedy and they're feeling a little different.

281
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Well, that's hope that's not the case.

282
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Whatever.

283
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
I don't know why I said romantic comedy.

284
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:46.000
All right, back to Sunsu. Sunsu said, whoever is in the first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy will be fresh for the fight.

285
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to the battle will arrive exhausted.

286
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Therefore, the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy.

287
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
But does not allow the enemies will to be imposed on him.

288
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Here, that all the time in MMA, who's going to impose their will on this fight?

289
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Hmm.

290
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach his own accord.

291
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
That's bait.

292
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Right.

293
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Or by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.

294
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Hmm.

295
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000
If the enemy is taking his ease, meaning if the enemy is trying to rest, he can harass him.

296
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
If well supplied, he can starve him out.

297
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
If quietly in camp, he can force him to move.

298
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
So all these are just little things to basically annoy the enemy.

299
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Throw him off his game, throw him off of his game.

300
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Up here, at points, which the enemy must hasten to defend.

301
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
March swiftly to places where you are not expected.

302
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And army may march great distances without distress if he marches through country where the enemy is not.

303
00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you attack places,

304
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
which are not defended.

305
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Totally obvious.

306
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Right.

307
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you attack places, which are not defended.

308
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And this is something that we do in Gigiitsu.

309
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
You know, you're attacking the neck, you're attacking the neck, they're protecting the neck, they're protecting the neck, boom arm.

310
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Or you're going for a community, you're going for a community, boom straight arm lock, other arm.

311
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Yeah.

312
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Big one is when you fake a submission to go for a guard pass or something that's not a submission, you know?

313
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Because it throws your mind off, like Greg does that really well, where he'll go for that guitine.

314
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
And you're like, oh, he's going for a submission.

315
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000
So your mind is one thing to be like, okay, I see he's going for my neck and then get my arm could be exposed.

316
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
That's one thing because you're thinking, okay, this submission to this next submission.

317
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.000
But if it's, you know, if they're going for something completely different, different aspect of the game, it throws your feet in more.

318
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
He's got me with that, like three times in a row before.

319
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Yeah, that's basically going even further to the flank.

320
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Yeah.

321
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Getting some, you know, you're expecting this somebody to shoot you with a machine gun, they start lobbing mortars at you.

322
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Yeah.

323
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
You weren't ready for that at all.

324
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Or they start taking your guy's hostage, it didn't even let that through the back door or something like that, you know?

325
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Completely different.

326
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Yeah.

327
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
You can ensure the safety of your defense if you hold only positions that cannot be attacked.

328
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
How obvious is that?

329
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Yeah.

330
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Let's just get in positions where we can't be attacked and then we will defend them very easily.

331
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known.

332
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
For then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points.

333
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:55.000
And his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionally few.

334
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
So you don't want to let the enemy know where you're going to attack him because then he can defend that specific area.

335
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Whereas if he has to defend all of the areas, he's got less people defending where you're going to attack.

336
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
We didn't really well in World War II, the D-Day.

337
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
You know, the Germans did not know they were suspect where we were going to attack but they didn't know it was Normandy.

338
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
So they had a lot of defenses, strewn about another area's.

339
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And they cost all.

340
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Now here we go with how we deal with what the enemy does.

341
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
For should the enemy strengthen his van, which van is like the division at the front.

342
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
It's the front of your troops, van.

343
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
That's why they like to term van guard.

344
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Is that your front front guard?

345
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear.

346
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van.

347
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right, should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left.

348
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000
If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere.

349
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Week.

350
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
And that's what you know again going to Jiu Jitsu when someone is when you feel impassing and they're blocking you.

351
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
And they're thinking about a knee lock and you get all those things going on at the same time.

352
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
And you're just trying to spread your defenses then.

353
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Then when they do one of those three, you're in trouble.

354
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
And I always explain to people, you know, when you, it's easy.

355
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
It's pretty easy for anybody.

356
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
If you tell me, I'm going to try and straighten out your arm and that's my whole focus is to stop you for straight in my arm.

357
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
It's, you know, I can do it.

358
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
I can do it pretty well.

359
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I'm well defended on that area.

360
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
There's no opening somewhere else.

361
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Right?

362
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
And the same thing with guard passing.

363
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
If I'm trying to pass your guard all tight.

364
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Low and heavy.

365
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
And you're just defending defending defending.

366
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
That means there's opening somewhere else probably far away from you.

367
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Yeah.

368
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Super common with guard passing is, you know, you smash to the, you know, one side right your smashing smashing to one side.

369
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
And then you hop your hips over the other side.

370
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
That's why it opened all the time.

371
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
And the hearty you smash.

372
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
The more wide open that far side is.

373
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Yeah, that's a common one.

374
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Yeah, it's just a distraction.

375
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Yeah.

376
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
And then a flank.

377
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Mm-hmm.

378
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Sun soon has been doing it for 2500 years.

379
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Dang.

380
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
All right.

381
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Do not repeat the tactics which you have gained.

382
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Your on victory.

383
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory.

384
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
But let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.

385
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Military tactics are like unto water.

386
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
For water in its natural course runs away from high places.

387
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
And a hastens downward.

388
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
So in war, the way to avoid what is strong is to strike what is weak.

389
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Now, this is something that we definitely got raised with in the sealed things.

390
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
You don't use the same methodology over and over and over again and develop pattern.

391
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
You don't do it.

392
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
No matter how minor you change things up, you change things up.

393
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Mm-hmm.

394
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
And that's something that any good military unit does.

395
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
It's something that anybody that's being able to do.

396
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
That's being threatened.

397
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
You know, if your life is in danger, you don't set a pattern on what you do.

398
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
You change it up.

399
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Water shapes it's course according to the ground over which it flows.

400
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000
The soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.

401
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare, there are no constant conditions.

402
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
You got to have an open mind.

403
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
You can't get trapped inside your own tactics.

404
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
You can't get trapped inside your own game.

405
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
And I see this with businesses we work with.

406
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000
We've companies that we work with where they have got their thing that they've done and they've been successful for six years run.

407
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
And then all of a sudden something changes.

408
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
And they're trying to run the same methodology without ever stepping back and saying,

409
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Wait a second, we did well.

410
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
We had a 12% growth average for the past six years.

411
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
And all of a sudden we're down 22%.

412
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
What happened?

413
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Well, let's just do what we did before again.

414
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
And again, that's what that's what how people spiral into bankruptcy.

415
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Well, because the conditions, the decisions come in change.

416
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
But conditions change.

417
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
And they don't look and say, oh, the enemy adapted.

418
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
The competitors adapted.

419
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.000
You know, we can look at some of these businesses that have gone on in the music industry has changed dramatically.

420
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
CDs.

421
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
I mean, imagine if you own a CD production warehouse somewhere.

422
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
I mean, you would have written CDs.

423
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Yeah, it's our records classic example.

424
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Yeah.

425
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
And back to that, doing the same thing over and over again.

426
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Like, if you succeed with this one method, it's like sales people.

427
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
You know, sales people, they really look a lot of them.

428
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And they really look at sales as this kind of war.

429
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
You know, it's me again.

430
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Someone makes the sale either you sell them your product or they sell you way to come by, whatever.

431
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
When you see as a consumer, when you see the sale, especially from sales people directly,

432
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:20.000
when you see the same language over and over after all, you're like, I see exactly what you're doing.

433
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
See what you're doing.

434
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
You know how they ask you.

435
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000
They'll ask you a question that if you say no to you look dumb or something like that, you know, so it's, I don't know if they're going to say yes 15 times a row.

436
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Yeah, there'd be like, oh, obviously, right.

437
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
And you're like, I can't, you kind of feel like you can't say no.

438
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
But after all, you're like, I see what you're doing.

439
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
So it may work because then they probably teach them that.

440
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
You know, so it's like, oh, yeah, that works.

441
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
That works.

442
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
But yeah, I want to start getting hip to it.

443
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Stuff won't work anymore.

444
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Not, it's definitely not going to work on that.

445
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Go Charles.

446
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
No, no, no, no.

447
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
I see what you're doing.

448
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
I see what you guys are doing.

449
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
All right.

450
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
And this is just restating the same thing.

451
00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000
He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning.

452
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Maybe called a heaven-born captain.

453
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
So if you can look at what your opponent's doing, and this is something that, again,

454
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
I see companies do it.

455
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
I see jujitsu players do it.

456
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
They have that one thing that they're used to.

457
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
And then someone's really good at defending that one thing.

458
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
And they just keep going against it, keep going against it.

459
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Keep running into that brick wall.

460
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
And it's not going to get you where you want to be.

461
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Yeah, it's problematic.

462
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Here we go.

463
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
From Sunsu, a soldier spirit is keenest in the morning.

464
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
By noon day, it has begun to flag.

465
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
And in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.

466
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000
A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when it's spirit is keen.

467
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
But attacks when it is sluggish and inclined to return.

468
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
This is the art of studying moods.

469
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Yeah, like that.

470
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
The art of studying moods is about knowing people.

471
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Yeah, is that kind of like the guy in jujitsu class?

472
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
He shows up like 15 minutes before the class ends when everyone's been rolling.

473
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Yeah, yeah.

474
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
He's getting everyone there and sluggish.

475
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Yeah, when they're ready to turn me.

476
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Go back to camp.

477
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Like, hey, guys, want to roll off for ash.

478
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
It is a military axiom, not to advance uphill against the enemy.

479
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.

480
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight.

481
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.

482
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy.

483
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Do not interfere with an army that's returning home.

484
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
That's a good one.

485
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
They're going, they're running, let them run, let them go home.

486
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
They're going to fight hard to get home, right?

487
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
They got visions of their family and their head.

488
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.

489
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Do not press a desperate foe too hard.

490
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
And this is something you see psychologically a lot.

491
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
You know, with an argument, you got a couple executives.

492
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
And maybe the senior executive has a plan and no one likes the plan.

493
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Well, you just don't want to box him in and prove him wrong in front of everybody.

494
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Right?

495
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
You don't want to do that.

496
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
You want to be crafty.

497
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
You want to get your son sued together.

498
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
You want to leave him a little opening.

499
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Where he can say, you know what?

500
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000
After reconsidering, I've decided I want to go with this other way because I figured out that blah blah blah.

501
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Yeah.

502
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
And I'm giving him an out.

503
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.000
What you don't want to do is make him stick to this bad plan because his ego is making him stick there.

504
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Yeah.

505
00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Recognize.

506
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions.

507
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
When you're doing your jutsu, don't when someone gets across side, you scramble.

508
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
You go crazy.

509
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Don't let him settle there.

510
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
When somebody's trying to get that, call the geek all the way up underneath your head and they're going to have you trapped.

511
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Don't let him get there.

512
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Don't linger in dangerously isolated positions.

513
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Move.

514
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Yeah.

515
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
It's it gets so complex with this and in jutsu where it's just, just get considered just what you said.

516
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Because this kind of, it kind of overflows into another part that he just talked about.

517
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
So let's say the example of the guy passing your guard into your side control.

518
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
During his past, you said don't let him settle.

519
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Exactly.

520
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
So, but when he, let's say whatever you lose the fight for whatever reason, any does settle.

521
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Now you're faced with a situation where if he's settled on you hard, where he's, you can tell he's putting strength into holding that position.

522
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
And then you try to scramble.

523
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Oh, you're going against, you're going full speed, you know, toe to toe.

524
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Like I always said not to do.

525
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
So at that point, you got to change your strategy.

526
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
If you had had already lost that battle, you and he settled and he's putting his energy into holding you.

527
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Now you got to play another tactic that he said, let him, you know, you got to relax a little bit.

528
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
So he starts relaxing a little bit.

529
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
You know what, that's like that's a common thing.

530
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
That's like, you know, a pretty well known strategy I would say when you get advanced in GJ2.

531
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
But it's crazy how he just lays it out and that's the perfect exact exact example.

532
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Yeah.

533
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
But all in one little, one little move.

534
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
One little movement.

535
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:48.000
And actually he continues on that same, on that same thread in himden situations.

536
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000
In other words, when you're surrounded and you're under the bad situation, you must resort to strategy.

537
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
And strategy doesn't really mean strategy.

538
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
It means like tricks, more than exceptions.

539
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
So you've, you've given up, you've given up your position.

540
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
The person is dominating you now.

541
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
And exactly what you're saying is correct.

542
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.000
When someone has got you in that position, either in an argument or a plan or a situation that you're in or a relationship,

543
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
they've got you locked down, stop fighting.

544
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
You know, it's not going to work.

545
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
You're, they've got you.

546
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
If you continue to struggle, you're just going to wear yourself out.

547
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
You're going to worsen this scenario.

548
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Stop.

549
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
And now you have to start thinking about a trick to get out of there.

550
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Some kind of a better tactic, some kind of a deception.

551
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Something to get you out of there.

552
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Because going strength, the strength is going to do it.

553
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
They're in a superior position.

554
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
You know, sometimes you can tell someone's doing that.

555
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
If you have them in a situation and they start actually using this tactic,

556
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:57.000
little trick, a little trick, one that I've been able to recognize is they do like some ad hominom luck in argument.

557
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
They'll start attacking something else.

558
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Oh, yeah.

559
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Yeah, of course.

560
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
But it's, yeah, if you kind of have a handle on the whole situation, it's real obvious.

561
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Yeah.

562
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Yeah.

563
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
And then he says, in a desperate position, you must fight.

564
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Now the difference here is now there's a submission hold on you.

565
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Yeah, no choice.

566
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Yeah, you have to fight with your finger fighter going to tap.

567
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Yeah.

568
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000
So you get that situation where it's gone beyond just their secure and they've got unit dominant position.

569
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
But now they're actually going to kill you.

570
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
You have no choice but to fight the last level of settling.

571
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Now this is interesting.

572
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
There are roads which must not be followed.

573
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Armies which must not be attacked.

574
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Towns which must not be besieged.

575
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Positions which must not be contested.

576
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.

577
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Hmm.

578
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
So it's always interesting to me when you hear somebody that's a military mastermind.

579
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:07.000
And they're saying that there are orders from their sovereign that must not be obeyed.

580
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
And I think we've heard that.

581
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
And this is something that people don't familiar with the military or not familiar with military history.

582
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
They think everyone just follows orders, follows orders, follows orders.

583
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.000
But Napoleon we've heard said, Sunsu we've heard said, we've heard these repeated things where people say,

584
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
You know what?

585
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
That's the wrong order.

586
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
And I'm not going to do it.

587
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Hmm.

588
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
And it's interesting too.

589
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
The other dichotomy is all these people talk about the necessity of discipline.

590
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
And inherent in discipline is absolutely the following of orders.

591
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
But as much as stringent as I am about discipline,

592
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Hmm.

593
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
If I'm I want my guys to question my words.

594
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Hmm.

595
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
I want them to say, hey wait a second why is Jockel making us do this?

596
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
He's he's wrong.

597
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
I don't want them to still bang me blindly.

598
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Hmm.

599
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Because you don't want your team obeying you blindly.

600
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
You don't want that.

601
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
You want them to be thinking.

602
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Back to the book.

603
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000
The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemies not coming,

604
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
but on our own readiness to receive him.

605
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Not on the chance of his not attacking,

606
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
but rather on the fact that we have made our position on the salibal.

607
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000
So what that is again, he's putting the the preponderance of the outcome,

608
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
not on what the enemy does, but on what you do.

609
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
It's not what happens, it's not what happens to you in your life.

610
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
It's what you do, it's what you prepare for.

611
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Hmm.

612
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
It's your own readiness that's going to affect the outcome.

613
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Not the chance of what the enemy is done, done.

614
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
It's how have you made your position.

615
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Hmm.

616
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
How have you set yourself up?

617
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
How have you prepared?

618
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
How have you trained?

619
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
How have you worked?

620
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
That's where the outcome comes from.

621
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Not what the world does to you, but what you do to the world.

622
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Hmm.

623
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general.

624
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
One recklessness which leads to destruction.

625
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Two cowardice which leads to capture.

626
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
So those two, you got one guy that's a maniac that doesn't care,

627
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
he's going to go get after it, he's going to die.

628
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
You got someone else that's a coward, he's going to get captured.

629
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Hmm.

630
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Three, a hasty temper that can be provoked by insults.

631
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Dangerous.

632
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
A delicacy of honor that is sensitive to shame.

633
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Sort of the same thing.

634
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
And an over-solicitude for his men which exposes him to worry and trouble.

635
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
An over-solicitude that's basically you over-efectionate.

636
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Care about the men so much that exposes you to worry and trouble.

637
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
These are the five-bassetting sins of a general.

638
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Ruiness to the conquer.

639
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Ruiness to the conduct of war.

640
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Some things to watch out for and it's interesting, you know, obviously the one that's.

641
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
That's.

642
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
I guess the most controversial to me is that over-solicitude for his men,

643
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
which exposes him to worry and trouble.

644
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Because, you know, in the modern military, you know, he was dealing with conscripts.

645
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
So even, it's interesting, even conscripts back then he said,

646
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
you could get to affectionate with your conscripts.

647
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
And now we have brothers.

648
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
And so you're gonna care about your guys.

649
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
You're gonna care about your guys more than anything else in the world.

650
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
But what you have to counter that with is not, hey, I'm not gonna care about them.

651
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
No, it's I'm gonna make sure I do everything I can to keep them safe.

652
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Yeah, yeah, I think, like, you know,

653
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
a lot of companies they discourage, fraturizing with, you know, your co-workers.

654
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
So I saw work in the nightclub industry where, you know, from time to time,

655
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
people would hook up.

656
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
So what that can result in is, you know,

657
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000
people who are too focused on the relationship between each other versus their job.

658
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Oh, yeah.

659
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
So, I'm, this is a total assumption, but maybe that's what he's talking about.

660
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
No, that's exactly what he's talking about.

661
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
That's exactly what he's talking about.

662
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
And, but if you take that into the military scenario,

663
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
it's, you know, like I said, you're gonna care about your guys so much.

664
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
And you have to counter that with the fact that you have a duty.

665
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Right.

666
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
And you have, you have a job.

667
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Yeah.

668
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
And that everybody on your team, like we're in the civil teams, you all know the risk.

669
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Yeah.

670
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Everybody knows the risk.

671
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Everybody knows that when you go on an operation, it might be your last operation.

672
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
You get hit with an ID, you get shot, you get mortar, you get blown up.

673
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
I mean, everybody accepts that risk.

674
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Yeah.

675
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
And that, therefore, as a leader, you know, you're not imposing that risk upon them.

676
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
They volunteered for that risk.

677
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
And I think that's what allows a modern military commander to, to say,

678
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
hey, I love these guys, but they all know what they signed up for.

679
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
There's gonna be risk here.

680
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
And we got a job to do.

681
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
As opposed to, hey, I love these guys.

682
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
They don't want to be here.

683
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
And I'm gonna send them to their deaths.

684
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
That would not, that would be a different scenario, a harder scenario.

685
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Yeah.

686
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Or you got close.

687
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Let's say, you know, you're in command of, you know, 10 guys.

688
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Five of those guys are your best friends.

689
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
And you get to attached in the sense that you have a mission that you have to do.

690
00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
A dangerous one.

691
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
But you're like, hey, I'm not gonna send those five guys because they're gonna be at risk.

692
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
I want to keep them safe.

693
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
You know, so I don't want to send them there.

694
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000
See, the other five guys go rather than the 10 and, you know, messes up your whole job.

695
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Yeah.

696
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Your whole job.

697
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Which, oddly enough, I will always send like the guys I love.

698
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
It's great.

699
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Worst scenario.

700
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Yeah.

701
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
All my brothers, they would be lining up and saying, I'm going.

702
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
And I'm going.

703
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Yeah.

704
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
It's fired up.

705
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
See, yeah.

706
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
I mean, you're obviously a very specific type of person.

707
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Yeah.

708
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
And your guys probably are too.

709
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
I would imagine.

710
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:42.000
But still, you're still exercising that discipline between, you know, them potentially going to their death.

711
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
And that job you guys have to do.

712
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
So you're thinking of it in a smarter way.

713
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
And it's interesting.

714
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
I just thought of this like, if a guy got in trouble for whatever reason when we were over on deployment,

715
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000
whenever I was on deployment and combat, if a guy got in trouble, you know what their punishment would be?

716
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
You're not allowed to go on a mission.

717
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
I know. So that just tells you what kind of an attitude, you know, the guys that we're working with.

718
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Yeah.

719
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Is that, oh, you can't go on these next three missions.

720
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Yeah.

721
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Guys are angry.

722
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Yeah.

723
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
And they're hurt because they realize they're letting their buddies down.

724
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000
You know, if something goes wrong and they're not there, it's a nightmare.

725
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Yeah. And they're, they're, they're duty, they're job is, it's part of them, you know, where I,

726
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
I was listening to this thing where he's talking about this, the omnisch, omnisch people, right?

727
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
And they're really into work, you know, hard work and stuff.

728
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
One of the punishments for the kids would be, you're not allowed to work.

729
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Yeah. That's the same as the same thing.

730
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
It's like saying it's like there.

731
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Yeah. Same thing.

732
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Yeah.

733
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Meanwhile, my kids, I got to beat them senseless to get them do any work.

734
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Just kidding.

735
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Just kidding.

736
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
But I guarantee they're not working as hard as some omnisch kid out of field.

737
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Yeah.

738
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
I'm putting up buildings with the wood nails that they do.

739
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Yeah.

740
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
That's awesome.

741
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Yeah.

742
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Yeah. The work is obviously part of their identity.

743
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Yeah.

744
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
You know, so like, you know, it's certain things people, let's say, quote,

745
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
I'm quote, normal people might find like exercise, for example.

746
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Like if so, if let's say you're just an average person who's like, man, I got to,

747
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
I'm going to make a new just resolution.

748
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
I'm going to lose some weight or whatever.

749
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
I'm going to get a trainer and it's hard for them.

750
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
It's work for them.

751
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Right. So the trainer is like, hey, today's rest day.

752
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
They're going to, oh, sweet.

753
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
You know, but then you take you for example, like how you're saying,

754
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
your wife is like, hey, maybe don't go to Jiu Jitsu today.

755
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
You're all pissed.

756
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Yeah.

757
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
You know, so it's the exact opposite.

758
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
But so that's kind of the scenario when it's ingrained in you and it's starting to

759
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
become part of your identity.

760
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Work or not work, you want to get that done.

761
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Yeah.

762
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
That's interesting.

763
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000
How those those embedded feelings, you know, develop in your life.

764
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
But what an awesome deal.

765
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Like if you think about that, we would actually, if we had to punish our guys,

766
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
we'd punish them by saying you can't go on two missions.

767
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
That's perfect.

768
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Yeah, it'd be angry.

769
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
They'd be bald.

770
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
They'd be letting down.

771
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
They'd like help everyone get ready and they'd stand there whenever it's leaving.

772
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
And learn their lesson first.

773
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Pardon.

774
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Pardon.

775
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
All right.

776
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Next, when the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural

777
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.000
strength of his position.

778
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
This is a good one.

779
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
So when you're when you're when you're in GJ2, when someone, for instance, pulls

780
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
guard real quick, you know, they've got a good guard.

781
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Yeah.

782
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
You know, when someone's like all standing up and all upright and reaching for your collar while

783
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
you're standing, you know, they got some judo going on.

784
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000
So it's funny how when when people have a dominant position, they'll lean towards it.

785
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Yeah.

786
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:53.000
If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.

787
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
So if it looks good to be true, it's too good to be true.

788
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
You got to watch that.

789
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:07.000
When there is much running about, it means that the critical moment has come.

790
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
When some are seeing it advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.

791
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:17.000
When soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.

792
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:23.000
If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering

793
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
from thirst.

794
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:33.000
If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.

795
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:40.000
If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.

796
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak.

797
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is a foot.

798
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:59.000
When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking pots over the campfires,

799
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:08.000
showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.

800
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:20.000
The sight of men whispering together in small knots and speaking in subdued tones points to dissatisfaction amongst the rank and file.

801
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Now, all those right there, what I would like about those, because some of them are a little bit archaic.

802
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
People are leaning on their spears.

803
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000
People not putting out their cooking pots.

804
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Those are things that we are going to see today.

805
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:41.000
But what's so key about this is how observing how people act can tell you much more if you are paying attention to it.

806
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:47.000
You see people talking amongst themselves and small groups, there is a problem going on.

807
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Those are the kind of things that you are going to be aware of.

808
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Especially as a leader.

809
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.000
When you are in a leadership position and you see and you look and you watch and you listen.

810
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Because actually some people, some leaders, they get isolated from the troops, they get isolated from the situation,

811
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000
they get isolated from the enemy, they are not reading what's happening.

812
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000
So you have to have this awareness and the sensitivity, right?

813
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
It is a sensitivity, it is a sixth sense of a something is not right here.

814
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
And what are you picking that up from?

815
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
When you walk in a room, everyone is all talking or you see from a distance people are talking.

816
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
And then when you either walk fire, you join them, they are happy to be done talking every single time.

817
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
That's not going to be a good sign.

818
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
They are talking about you.

819
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Back to the book.

820
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
He exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents.

821
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000
It is sure to be captured by them.

822
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:57.000
So when you are saying, oh, we don't have enough in the fear here, we can take these guys, we can win that contract, we can beat the opponent, we can win.

823
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
That's when you are going to be taken down.

824
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.000
If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive.

825
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
And unless submissive, they will be practically useless.

826
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:19.000
If when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.

827
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Therefore, soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.

828
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000
This is a certain road to victory.

829
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:42.000
If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well disciplined.

830
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:49.000
So now you do realize that Sun Siu 2,500 years ago was leading humans.

831
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000
And if you came out of the gate before they knew you and you treated them bad, they were never going to work for you.

832
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000
They were never going to submit to what you want to do.

833
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.000
And once they were attached to you, if you had punishments and now you had built enough respect, and then you said you were going to punish them for something that they did.

834
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000
You said a certain standard, and then you don't hold it, they're going to be equally useless.

835
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
In consistent.

836
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
In consistent.

837
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Firmly believe it.

838
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:27.000
If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well disciplined.

839
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:34.000
You got to stay consistent, and you got to remember that you're dealing with humans.

840
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:43.000
When common soldiers are too strong, and their officers are too weak, the result is in subordination.

841
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:52.000
And this is something that I saw a couple times in my career, where I had a guy that worked for me, who was a tough guy.

842
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000
This happened a couple times, just a badass guy, super tough beast, hardcore, go getter.

843
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
And when they worked for me, man, I loved him.

844
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
And they did anything.

845
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000
I would tell them to go, you know, run through a brick wall, they would start running.

846
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000
And they would run through the brick wall, they'd figured out, they'd get through that thing.

847
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Super hard.

848
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
And then one guy, I like I went to another team, and he went on another deployment, and got sent home from deployment.

849
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Because he was just too much to handle.

850
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:29.000
And his subordinate, I talked to him about it, he goes, oh, my officers were weak.

851
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
He literally said, my officers were weak.

852
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:40.000
And so here is like a cage to animal, that if you don't, if you just know who the boss is,

853
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
and he doesn't respect the boss, he's not going to listen to you.

854
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
He was the alpha male, right?

855
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000
And when he was the alpha male, he was doing whatever he wanted, wasn't listening to these people that were in charge of him.

856
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Yeah, what is that?

857
00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Like a mix of, like he doesn't, I don't want to look up to him, but there's a sense of that right where if your leader is just going to spend,

858
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:10.000
you have that kind of ingrained respect, and then not to mention on top of that, you don't fear any real consequences from him.

859
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000
You know, it's kind of weak.

860
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000
I can take whatever you can dish out kind of thing.

861
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000
So it's both of those.

862
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
You think?

863
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Yeah, oh yeah.

864
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Yeah, this one guy that this happened with, I taught him Gjitsu, and he was excited about it in a way that I've never seen anyone excited.

865
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Like, super happy about knowing that you could choke people, and he would get into fights in the civilian world,

866
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000
and come and give me these full de-briefs and ask me for pointers and judgment,

867
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:49.000
and that was, you know, a warrior that liked to fight, and he found out that you could grab people and submit them.

868
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
You were super excited about it.

869
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Yeah, like a little kid.

870
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000
And I always say that that's kind of the risk you run with teaching people Gjitsu, because it is like,

871
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:06.000
I'm going to, it's a superpower, essentially, because you don't have to learn that much for it to be effective in this huge way.

872
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000
So, you know, like, kind of like, what is it? Superman.

873
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
With great power and comes great responsibility.

874
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Yeah.

875
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Yeah.

876
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Goes on to say, when the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.

877
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:31.000
So when you put the super hardcore guy over that can't modulate his, his leadership, he can't back off and build people up before he starts to smash him.

878
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:39.000
You're going to get collapse and that's something you definitely got to look out for, especially if you're a super strong leader and you come and take over a team that's been led by somebody that's weak.

879
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
There's a chance that the players in the team are weak.

880
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:48.000
And now you got to come in and build them up before you let loose your vicious leadership power, right?

881
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
You can't just come in there with the iron fist and start dropping hammers.

882
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000
No, you need to say, hey, guys, all right, let's go, let's build this team up.

883
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:03.000
And then you can escalate your own force as your subordinates grow and become powerful themselves.

884
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000
But you don't want there to be a huge gap between your power.

885
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Yeah.

886
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
And theirs.

887
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Because they won't develop into it. They'll just be in the shadow.

888
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
They won't grow in the shadow. You got to come down and let some light get to them and let them grow.

889
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Right.

890
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:28.000
When the general is weak and without authority, when his orders are not clear and distinct,

891
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:36.000
when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men and the ranks are formed in a slavingly haphazard manner,

892
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.000
the result is utter disorganization.

893
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Pretty clear.

894
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:54.000
If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight.

895
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Even though the ruler forbid it, if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight,

896
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
even at the ruler's bidding.

897
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Once again, disobeying the chain of commands, sunsue himself,

898
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:15.000
disobeying the chain of command.

899
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:24.000
This is a big one. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace,

900
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000
who's only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign,

901
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000
is the jewel of the kingdom.

902
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000
So that guy that's not doing this to get famous, that's not doing this for awards,

903
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
that's not doing this to get promoted.

904
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000
It's not being brave to be promoted, he's doing this to protect the country,

905
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000
or to carry out the mission, not doing it for glory.

906
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.000
And furthermore, the same person can retreat without feeling like a disgrace.

907
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
That means they're going to protect their people without going all we can't fall back.

908
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:07.000
This person is the jewel of the kingdom, the jewel of the kingdom,

909
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000
and it's beautiful when you work for people like that. That what they're trying to do is they're trying to do their mission,

910
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000
they're trying to do good for the country, they're trying to do good for the team, they're trying to do good for the business.

911
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
That's what they're trying to do. They're not trying to get promoted,

912
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000
they're not trying to get in the war, they're not trying to get a good fitness report,

913
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000
or a good evaluation, they're trying to do a good job.

914
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
And that's why when people ask me a lot, you know,

915
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
all I've got this boss that wants to get the credit for everything, give it to them.

916
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Give it to them.

917
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Let them look good.

918
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Don't do it for your glory.

919
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Give that glory away. It feels good to give glory away. Give it away.

920
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.000
I told you, you saw working the nightclub right in the street back when I was young,

921
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000
and kind of the protocol would be to, you know,

922
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000
we'd work with whatever, and the bartenders would give us tips.

923
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Like, you don't like a little tips, right?

924
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000
So at the end of the week, it'd be kind of pulled, right?

925
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000
And we'd get some tips at the end of the week, school, whatever.

926
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
So my boss, so he was back when I first started,

927
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000
my bought the head door guy, right?

928
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.000
He was at the end of the week, he called his own little meeting with us.

929
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
We're like, all right, so he kind of goes over some stuff.

930
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
I don't even know what it was.

931
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:27.000
And he busted at the end. He's like, hey, guys, so, yeah, we have tips.

932
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000
So what I did was, you know, hey, you guys are doing a great job.

933
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
I did was, I took my tips and I gave it to you guys.

934
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
And he kind of had this look on his face looking at us as if he needed us to be like,

935
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000
wow, that was so great, but you know, when the look is so transparent,

936
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
he's like, so,

937
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000
I was like, this guy, it's like so disingenuous, you know, like he wanted the credit.

938
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000
And he wanted to be like, oh, thank you, thank you, you know.

939
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000
It wasn't that much by the way.

940
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Yeah, it was, you know, $14 each.

941
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000
If that, because we got to divide it up anyway, but yeah, that was like,

942
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000
is the clear example of that very thing right there where you can tell it.

943
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Giving us the tips, I know what you did that.

944
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Yeah.

945
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000
You know, okay, you like my younger daughter.

946
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:20.000
She does good deeds for the sole purpose of increasing birthday present.

947
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Christmas present.

948
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Does it that kind of go into a different strategy altogether?

949
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Yeah, that's pretty, it's pretty cute.

950
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000
And you see this sexual, like, daddy.

951
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
I decided it would be really great if I picked up your socks.

952
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Right, since my birthday is coming, right, but that's another tactic.

953
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
It's like, it's called a reciprocal something.

954
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Like, when you do something and then you expect something to happen.

955
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Yeah, but what that, it's effective.

956
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Heart creation is used to do it.

957
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000
They be like, you know what, hey, hey,

958
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.000
whatever their message is, and they'd be like, hey, take this free gift.

959
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000
And they'd be like, I don't know a flower or a book or something.

960
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
And they know that that'll leave you the typical person.

961
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
They'd leave them with a feeling of dang, like, I kind of owe this person.

962
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
He was so nice to me.

963
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I can't just walk off and be a dick.

964
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
You know, so I'll give you five bucks or $1,000.

965
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Yeah, especially when you recognize they're doing it.

966
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
In fact, you do yourself a disservice to fall for it because they're going to keep doing it.

967
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
You know, it's basically gilting someone into do something.

968
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
But it's called reciproc...

969
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I don't know, something reciprocal, something.

970
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Well, I guess we'll look that up and figure it out later.

971
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Yeah.

972
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Otherwise, what's called reciprocal, something.

973
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Yeah.

974
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
All right.

975
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Now here you go.

976
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
This is speaking of kids.

977
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
This is awesome.

978
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Regardless of your soldiers as your children,

979
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
and they will follow you into the deepest valleys.

980
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Look on them as your own beloved sons,

981
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
and they will stand by you even unto death.

982
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Completely true statement.

983
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Mm-hmm.

984
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Completely true statement.

985
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000
If, however, you are indulgent,

986
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
but unable to make your authority felt,

987
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands,

988
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000
and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder,

989
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
then your soldiers must be likened to spoiled children.

990
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
They are useless for any practical purpose.

991
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I think that speaks for itself.

992
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
If you are so lenient with your troops,

993
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
when they say indulgent, that's what I mean.

994
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I mean, I mean, a like, super lenient.

995
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
When you are lenient with your troops,

996
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
when you can't make your authority felt,

997
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
when you are super kind-hearted,

998
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
you are unable to enforce your commands.

999
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
All those things you can have,

1000
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and have spoiled little kids for troopers.

1001
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
And they are not going to be worthless.

1002
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I got a little saying about kids.

1003
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Lay it on me.

1004
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000
If you are helping them, you are hurting them.

1005
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Think about it.

1006
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
If you are helping them, you are hurting them.

1007
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
You want me to tie your shoe, tie yourself.

1008
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Because when they tie their shoes,

1009
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
that literally trains their fine motor skills.

1010
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
If you want them, if they want to glass a water,

1011
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
go get your own glass a water.

1012
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
They want help moving something across their hallway.

1013
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
You move across the hallway.

1014
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
If you are helping your kids, you are hurting your kids.

1015
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And I could take it one step further and say,

1016
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
if you are hurting your kids, you are helping them.

1017
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
You are not going to do that.

1018
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
But really, I do think about that.

1019
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
When your kids ask you for something,

1020
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
you have to say, is this something they can do themselves?

1021
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Even if it is a struggle form, even if it is a challenge form.

1022
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
For a while, my daughter was late for school,

1023
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
and can you just tie my shoes?

1024
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
No, I can't tie your shoes.

1025
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
You can tie your shoes.

1026
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And that is when they work on their fine motor skills.

1027
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And that is when they learn that they can, that they have to get the skill.

1028
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
They become more self-reliant.

1029
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Yeah, yeah, fully in, obviously I am not going to wage some kind of

1030
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
semantical battle with you or nothing like that.

1031
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
But it depends on what you mean by help.

1032
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And I talked about this before, where you have systemic help in direct help.

1033
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
So systemic help is exactly what you do in entire own shoes.

1034
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
How about you get, how about I teach you to tie your shoes?

1035
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And prepare you for this shoe tying world that you're about to embark in.

1036
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
That's systemic help.

1037
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
That's the real help in my opinion.

1038
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Same thing like a homeless person, you give a homeless person a dollar that's direct help.

1039
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
That doesn't help.

1040
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
That's hurting him, as you would say.

1041
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
So what is that called direct help direct?

1042
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
So don't give your children direct direct help.

1043
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Systemic help.

1044
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Your job is to prepare kids to do everything.

1045
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I think that's in a perfect world.

1046
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Everything on their own.

1047
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
By the time they go.

1048
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And you actually can prepare a human to do everything on their own because at least you prepare them to face a challenge,

1049
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
research out over a comment, practice over coming in and over a comment.

1050
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000
So if you teach them, if you teach them, you know you say you can give them a fish or you can teach them a fish.

1051
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
You can teach them to learn how to fish on their own.

1052
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
That's what you really want to do.

1053
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Yes.

1054
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Put that on a t-shirt.

1055
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

1056
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And if you go the more systemic, you could probably end up breaking it down into maybe three things.

1057
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And you know, whatever those things are, I know they're going to have something to do with how to think, how to manage

1058
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000
emotions, how to adapt like a lot of the real basic things that are going to in one way or another, apply to everything.

1059
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Yeah.

1060
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
It's interesting that you go from this is in back in the book.

1061
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I went back to the conversation.

1062
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Back to the book.

1063
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
It's funny how you're talking about sons who are to war and we're talking about kids.

1064
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
We're talking about business.

1065
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
We're talking about night clubs.

1066
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
We're talking about you, Jitsu.

1067
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
All right.

1068
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Back to the book now for real.

1069
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Those who are called skillful leaders of old, new how to drive a wedge between the enemies front and rear to prevent cooperation between his large and small divisions to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad.

1070
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
The officers from rallying their men.

1071
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
So when you are looking at your opponent, what can you do to split them up?

1072
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
What can you do to interfere with what they're trying to make happen?

1073
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
That's a skill set in its own.

1074
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000
So instead of worrying about attacking you, I'm worried about I'm focused on dispersing you or splitting you up.

1075
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Instead of worrying about attacking you, I'm worried about hindering people from helping you.

1076
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It's a different way of thinking about waging a battle.

1077
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Instead of thinking about the battle itself, what other ways are there to go about this more creatively?

1078
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Repidity is the essence of war.

1079
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Take advantage of the enemies unreadiness.

1080
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Make your way by unexpected routes and attack unguarded spots.

1081
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
There you go back to the human side of things.

1082
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Carefully study the well-being of your men and do not over-tax them.

1083
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength.

1084
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Keep your army continually on the move and devise unfathomable paths.

1085
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Now this is interesting.

1086
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Throw your soldiers into positions once there is no escape and they will prefer to fight.

1087
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
They will prefer death to flight.

1088
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Officers in men alike will put forth their utmost strength.

1089
01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:03.000
At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him.

1090
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.

1091
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:14.000
He burns his boats and breaks his cooking pots.

1092
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
It's a second time we've heard about those cooking pots.

1093
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Obviously that men's something back in the day.

1094
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
That men is on.

1095
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
We're not coming back.

1096
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
We're not needing for dinner tonight.

1097
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
But that's an attitude to have.

1098
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000
It's interesting. This is somewhat contradictory to some of what the other things that he said in the book.

1099
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
If the enemy is strong, fade away.

1100
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Now he's saying, put your soldiers in a position where there's no escape.

1101
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
That's contrary.

1102
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I understand or the way I translate that is if you have to accomplish something very challenging and you have no choice, step into it.

1103
01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Step into it, kick away the ladder.

1104
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Break your cooking pots and let the guys know we're not coming back from this.

1105
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
We have what one choice and that's victory.

1106
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
All in.

1107
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Thus, or sorry, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the Keevae.

1108
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Keevae, which means who goes, which means on watch, Keevaevae.

1109
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Without waiting, this is the important part.

1110
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Without waiting to be asked, they will do your will.

1111
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Without restriction, they will be faithful.

1112
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Without giving orders, they can be trusted.

1113
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:48.000
So, you get the pure decentralized command, where without waiting to be asked to do something, they're going to do it.

1114
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
That's what you want your troopers to do.

1115
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
They will do your will.

1116
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Without restrictions, they will be faithful.

1117
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000
You don't have to hold on to me.

1118
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
You don't have to give them commands.

1119
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
You don't have to give them orders.

1120
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
They're going to be faithful to you.

1121
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Without giving orders, they can be trusted.

1122
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
That's true decentralized command.

1123
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:14.000
And that's what you want.

1124
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And then, to wrap this one up.

1125
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:30.000
One happy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise.

1126
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Meaning he won't have everyone to think.

1127
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And we want everybody to be on the same page.

1128
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Move not unless you see an advantage.

1129
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Use not your troops unless there is something to be gained.

1130
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Fight not unless the position is critical.

1131
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Again, that's contrary to what I just talked about.

1132
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
But I think the reason he said that is because sometimes you have to.

1133
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Sometimes you get into the decisive situation.

1134
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
You have to fight.

1135
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
You have to win.

1136
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
No ruler should put troops into the field.

1137
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Marlee to gratify his own spleen.

1138
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.000
And spleen when he says that that you step be where people.

1139
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Thought that the seat of emotion was.

1140
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
So your emotion came from your spleen.

1141
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
So he's saying what you've been saying the whole night.

1142
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
No ruler should put troops in the field.

1143
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Nearly to gratify his own emotions.

1144
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
And that emotion could be a good idea.

1145
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
It could be irritating.

1146
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.000
No general should fight a battle simply out of peak.

1147
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And that's pride and ego.

1148
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:54.000
If it is to your advantage to make a forward move, make a forward move.

1149
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000
If not, stay where you are.

1150
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Such is the art of war.

1151
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Obviously, so much to be learned from the past, from the ancients.

1152
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
And also it's so accessible.

1153
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
There are so many lessons to be learned there.

1154
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Lessons that if you learn there mistakes that you don't have to make yourself.

1155
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000
All you have to do is open a book.

1156
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
It open your mind.

1157
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And you'll be there.

1158
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And I think we can now go to questions from the interwebs.

1159
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Let's do it.

1160
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:56.000
But before that, internet stuff, go to onit.com slash jockel.

1161
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And why do you want to do that?

1162
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Get some good stuff.

1163
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Yeah, good stuff.

1164
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Supplements.

1165
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Shroom tech.

1166
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
If you're into high intensity workouts for some prolonged period of time,

1167
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
give to you, give to you that boost and that sustenance.

1168
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000
As far as output goes, alpha brain helps your mind work.

1169
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
That's the ones that I think we, that I recommend.

1170
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
And the warrior bar.

1171
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Do yourself that favor in life.

1172
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
And I do the krill oil.

1173
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Of course krill oil.

1174
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I went to a meeting this week.

1175
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
They had a big old stack of warrior bars when I went in.

1176
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
They brought it.

1177
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Yeah.

1178
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
They were in the game.

1179
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
My boy Zach was in the game down there.

1180
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
You know, that'll surely enhance the meeting for sure where you're going.

1181
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Get it.

1182
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
You did.

1183
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000

1190
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Coffee mug up before the enemy.

1191
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
First question.

1192
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Jockel.

1193
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
As an overthinker, you missed some factors.

1194
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Exiety, low confidence, low IQ,

1195
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000
or IQ, perfectionism, and often a failure to prioritize.

1196
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Yeah.

1197
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
So this is a question from the last podcast.

1198
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And this guy just sent me this tweet. And I thought it was a good assessment.

1199
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Right.

1200
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Because I'm not an overthinker.

1201
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
And maybe this guy is, and sorry, don't have his Twitter calls on there.

1202
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
But he maybe he's an overthinker.

1203
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
So he kind of knew about it.

1204
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
And if you don't remember the question, you know, someone that over thinks things,

1205
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
they get analysis paralysis, right?

1206
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
They just start thinking and thinking and thinking.

1207
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
They're frozen from their own thoughts.

1208
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Too many thoughts.

1209
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
And so I thought these were good little factors here.

1210
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
And it basically, to me, and all boils down to actually fear.

1211
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Because if you're thinking, then you're not taking action.

1212
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And if you're not taking action, then there's no consequence.

1213
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
And if there's no consequence, and there's not any afraid of.

1214
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.000
So I think that the overthinking can be an excuse for actual fear.

1215
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And same thing with like, all my perfectionist.

1216
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
That's also fear. It's fear of not being perfect.

1217
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And then on top of that low confidence, well, if you have low confidence, guess what?

1218
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
You're afraid.

1219
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Your confidence is low.

1220
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
You're not sure yourself.

1221
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
So you sit around and think about doing it instead of actually doing it.

1222
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And then anxiety.

1223
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Well, yeah, anxiety actually is fear.

1224
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
You're afraid to do something.

1225
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And then IQ.

1226
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Now that might be, I guess, maybe someone has a high IQ, and therefore they're thinking a lot.

1227
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
And maybe that's not fear.

1228
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
But let me ask you a question.

1229
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
If you're so smart, then why aren't you taking the action and making something happens?

1230
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
We've got a big IQ that's no excuse to sit around and overthink things.

1231
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Especially because if you're so smart, why can't you come up with a quick solution?

1232
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Why can't you realize that overthinking is actually causing the problem of harm?

1233
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
It's not moving the problem forward.

1234
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000
So quick thinking so much and take action.

1235
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Next question.

1236
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000
He's talking about the Tim Ferriss, the video.

1237
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
That was the extension of your Tim Ferriss.

1238
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

1239
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
You're talking about martial arts.

1240
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Or martial arts.

1241
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
What are the best martial arts?

1242
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Right.

1243
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
If you haven't seen it, you can look it up.

1244
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:53.000
So he says, with respect to the above mentioned video about your views on real martial arts,

1245
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I have one quick question.

1246
01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.000
You said that you came to your conclusion based on a sparring match between yourself and one of your fellow Navy Seals.

1247
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Was the match between yourself and the traditional martial arts with 20 years experience of friendly sparring match, typical in training,

1248
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.000
where he was pulling his punches and strikes or was he attacking you with full force.

1249
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000
From my observation, you did two guys collect some headshots while going in for a take down.

1250
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:27.000
And if a traditional Karateka karate practitioner doesn't hold back with this had some devastating effects in the long run,

1251
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
similar to what Profit Balls players experience.

1252
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I would love to get your take on this someone who is real world experience.

1253
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Okay, so first of all, I didn't come to a conclusion based on that one event.

1254
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I mean, that event influenced my thoughts today, but even right now I don't have a conclusion.

1255
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Someone could show me something today.

1256
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
It's possible that I go, wow, that worked really well.

1257
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I never thought of that and that's new.

1258
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000
That now trumps everything else.

1259
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
It could happen.

1260
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Not likely though.

1261
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
My mind is still open, but that's not likely.

1262
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I've seen a lot.

1263
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Now in that particular scenario, he was usually, he wasn't using a striking art, a traditional striking art.

1264
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
He was using a traditional grappling art actually, I keto.

1265
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And so he was grappling with me.

1266
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:24.000
He wasn't throwing punches at me, but it doesn't matter because I have spared and or fought with plenty of people over the years.

1267
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
That were absolutely trying to knock me out, no doubt about it.

1268
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:34.000
And the fact of the matter is, it doesn't work.

1269
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Even where this guy above, like, for instance, this guy in the question, he says, if a traditional karate practitioner doesn't hold back,

1270
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:50.000
it would have the same devastating effect in the long run similar to what pro football players experience.

1271
01:17:50.000 --> 01:18:01.000
That statement actually defeats itself because if you watch a football game, those guys get hit in the head a hundred times during a football game.

1272
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
And how often do they get actually knocked unconscious? Not very often.

1273
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:12.000
If you multiply whatever ten players per side that are actually banging heads, times however many plays, you know,

1274
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:19.000
you're talking about thousand, you know, probably more than a thousand head on head contacts in a football game.

1275
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And there might be one knockout in a game.

1276
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Sometimes there's no knockouts.

1277
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Yeah.

1278
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Typically not knockouts.

1279
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.000
The fact of the matter is hitting someone in the head is not a guaranteed knockout by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it rarely occurs.

1280
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
It actually rarely occurs in boxing.

1281
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
You know, where two guys are trained to do that.

1282
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
So it's hard to knock somebody out.

1283
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
And it's the same thing in if you watch UFC, especially the early UFC's.

1284
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
This was proven over and over again.

1285
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000
That, yeah, the grappler is going to take some hits on the way in, but they're going to get in.

1286
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
And they're going to take the person down.

1287
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And of course, do you have a punch or chance? Of course you do.

1288
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:07.000
There's a very small chance that when you shoot it on somebody, they time a knee or they time a punch and it happens to hit you right in the spot that knocks you out.

1289
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
It does happen. It happens and you have to see occasionally.

1290
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:17.000
If you look at a number of take-downs to the number of knockouts that happen while the take-down is going on, it's not a big number at all.

1291
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Correct.

1292
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
You don't want to rely on that as your formation of self-defense at all.

1293
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Now when things evolved, eventually to where the strikers were wrestlers too.

1294
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000
And you got guys like Chuck and you got T-do and you got Randy where it wasn't their striking that was preventing the take-down.

1295
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
It was because they were badass wrestlers.

1296
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
That's what we stopped in the take-down.

1297
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Had nothing to do with the way they punched.

1298
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:48.000
So you really can't count on striking to stop a grappler.

1299
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000
That is not a good plan to say, hey, I'm going to get so good at striking that I'm going to stop a grappler.

1300
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
That is not a good plan. What you have to do is learn to grapple.

1301
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
You have to learn to wrestle. You have to learn to do it too.

1302
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:08.000
And the opposite side of that is you can't count on grappling to take down a striker because that person might know how to wrestle.

1303
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And therefore you need to know how to strike.

1304
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
So it goes back to what I say all the time.

1305
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
You got to know how to grab and get to know how to strike.

1306
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Right. Yeah. And if he's talking, he says a traditional karate practitioner.

1307
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Traditional.

1308
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:29.000
So I'm assuming that the only understanding I have of traditional is he doesn't do karate and he just doesn't.

1309
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
He's not a mixed martial artist. He just knows karate.

1310
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
So what I've lost on ground.

1311
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Yes, and I've taken karate before and there was no take down defense. There was no take down. There was no functioning in any capacity on the ground.

1312
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And so.

1313
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Yeah. And how you say like, okay, over the long term, okay, you're going to have head trauma and lasting damage.

1314
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
If you take sustained.

1315
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Yeah.

1316
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Head trauma repetitive.

1317
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Over the years, really, but we're worried about the next 42 seconds of a fight that's about to happen.

1318
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Not the next 30 decades of my life where you can see me break down because I took some head trauma.

1319
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Exactly. Right. So you'd have to get, let's say that for the example of this question that you're experienced with this guy.

1320
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
He was a karate guy and he was going full speed.

1321
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And he didn't knock you out. We'll just assume that he didn't knock you up.

1322
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
You'd have to go.

1323
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000
I'm going to restate that that is a very safe assumption to assume that the karate guy was not able to knock me out.

1324
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:37.000
That I was able to come in, you know, stand there, get it a good distance,

1325
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
faking with my hands, touch his face a couple times. He throws a big punch.

1326
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I do a double leg take down. He's on his back.

1327
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
It's game over.

1328
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Yeah.

1329
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And by the way, go watch any YouTube video of, you know,

1330
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:59.000
get to versus whatever and it's the same outcome every single time. You know, occasionally there'll be one with a lot of hits because it's the chance knock out or the chance of something else happened.

1331
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Yeah.

1332
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.000
But 99% of the time, it's double leg take down slam on the ground, game over.

1333
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Yeah.

1334
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Sorry.

1335
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Look at who did Randy Couture fight that Pro Boxer, Tony James Tony.

1336
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Oh yeah.

1337
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
It was that exactly. Here's a world-class boxer professional boxer. What did Randy do?

1338
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Got inside, took him down, came over.

1339
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Oh, why didn't you knock him out?

1340
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Because you can't.

1341
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Right. You can't just knock people out.

1342
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Yeah.

1343
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Yeah.

1344
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Fully.

1345
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And that's not to mention it. I mean, I'm going to mention it.

1346
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
But that it is not to mention that,

1347
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:43.000
especially if you practice that the more self-defense, like it's heavily self-defense oriented due to one of the first things you learn is distance management.

1348
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
One other first things you learn.

1349
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
It's like, you almost can't get past that element of it.

1350
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
So you will take hits, of course.

1351
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Maybe you'll take it to the top of your head, shoulders or whatever.

1352
01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:02.000
But yes, significant strikes to anything to warrant how it's stated here in the question long-term damage compared to football players.

1353
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
You back to your situation.

1354
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
You going with this guy, let's say he did go full speed.

1355
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000
You would have to do probably 10 to 15 bounce of that every single day.

1356
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
For a long time.

1357
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
For you to have any sustained damage.

1358
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
And then.

1359
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
So maybe if this guy is taking the long-term strategic view,

1360
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
you're going to continue to spar me.

1361
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Hit me in the head and time.

1362
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000
I'm saying, you're the old man.

1363
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Maybe you're a realistic disease.

1364
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
And maybe I'm saying maybe.

1365
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
So because if he's a traditional guy, he doesn't know how to manage the take down.

1366
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
So knowing how to manage the take down makes your strikes more effective.

1367
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
You don't have that.

1368
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Your strikes are not effective.

1369
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
So okay, you take one hit.

1370
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Let's say, let's say you take five hits.

1371
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Right?

1372
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
You controlling the fight as much as you did to does.

1373
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Even if you're not that high level versus the guy who doesn't know judi-to.

1374
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Way outweighs this grossly.

1375
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
To the point that these things are aside from the punchers chance.

1376
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
In effective.

1377
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
And I think UFC 1, 2, 3.

1378
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
You know, as before people started to get hit to the whole judi-to thing.

1379
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
But before people knew judi-to.

1380
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
They just knew there are other stuff.

1381
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
That was the testing ground.

1382
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
And I was the whole reason UFC was invented by the way.

1383
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
And that's why those first UFCs are awesome.

1384
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Yeah, you get to see these 250 and no bare knuckle kickboxer guys strong.

1385
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000
You know, go in there with real quote unquote real fighting experience against a way smaller grappler.

1386
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Do you get to guy in lose?

1387
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
In fact.

1388
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000
This is to go one step further if you watch UFC 2.

1389
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Pat Smith, who's one of my favorite guys by the way when I was watching is the kickboxer.

1390
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
It was bad ask guy.

1391
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Two 10 solid wrecking guys makes it to the finals against voice greasy.

1392
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
And the voice greasy didn't tap them out.

1393
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Or he tapped them out.

1394
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
But now with the submission hold, he tapped them due to strikes.

1395
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
So a grappler guy found it out.

1396
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
You know, a striker guy.

1397
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
No submissions.

1398
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
It was all punches.

1399
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
It was nowadays known with every top to that now.

1400
01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
But I'm just saying.

1401
01:24:59.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Yeah.

1402
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Only because they know.

1403
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
If you don't know.

1404
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
You just think you're dead.

1405
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Yeah.

1406
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Yeah.

1407
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Yeah. One guy like I said before, one guy tapped because he was claustrophobic. He just got mounted.

1408
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
But nonetheless.

1409
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Yeah.

1410
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000
It's hard to really reconcile really what this question.

1411
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I don't know if it's implying anything.

1412
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Well, it's definitely implying that this guy that I was going against was like holding back.

1413
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Right.

1414
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
And that might it, you know, hold the different tail if you don't.

1415
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Yeah.

1416
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:32.000
I've been against countless, literally countless of guys have spared against me trying to knock me out.

1417
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Whether they're traditional martial artists, whether they're just countless guys.

1418
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Yeah.

1419
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
And it's hard to knock somebody out.

1420
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Yeah.

1421
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000
And I don't know who that's a question. Of course I'm not going to, you know, hate on the question or nothing like that.

1422
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
But speaking from experience, this sounds like the exact question that inexperienced people have.

1423
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:56.000
You know, people who are, well, it's, no, this is coming most likely from somebody that's been heavily involved in traditional martial arts.

1424
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And it had been told that, hey, don't worry about somebody trying to take you down because if you just hit him here and here,

1425
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
or they'll fall and you'll win.

1426
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1427
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000
That's not, that's not good.

1428
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
That's sort of what I put this in here.

1429
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:14.000
And you know, just to make sure that, um, that they realize that, hey, you shouldn't, you should actually pay attention to what else is going on in the world.

1430
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Instead of staying in like, hey, just this one little traditional martial art.

1431
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Yeah.

1432
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
And it's the same thing with you.

1433
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
If you're just doing GJ2 and I got this in here later, there's another question about this.

1434
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000
But I mean, I don't tell people just train GJ2.

1435
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
I tell them, train GJ2, train Dressling, train Boxing, train Moitai.

1436
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Yeah.

1437
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And you know what, when you get done with all that and you have a good based train Krav Maga,

1438
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
and then you, you know what, do realistic situations.

1439
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
By the way, you should learn how to shoot a gun.

1440
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
By the way, you should be in good shape.

1441
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Do everything.

1442
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Yeah.

1443
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Yeah.

1444
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Yeah.

1445
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
One answer is not the answer.

1446
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Yeah.

1447
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
T-shirt.

1448
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Next question.

1449
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Every time we say something like that, like a one.

1450
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Answer is not the answer, which I must admit sounds pretty cool.

1451
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
That's pretty dope.

1452
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
But we'll get everyone's going to say, put that on a t-shirt.

1453
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
And then I have to refer to echo and see if he's going to put it on a t-shirt.

1454
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
You know, we'll see how that works out.

1455
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
All right.

1456
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Next question.

1457
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Is it better to reveal too much information or too little information, both in personal life and leadership?

1458
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Okay.

1459
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:32.000
So there's two sides to this, not just the personal and the business side, but in the business side, there's two pieces really.

1460
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
There's operational and planning, right?

1461
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:44.000
So if you've got something that you're planning for, whether you're in a company and you're trying to plan a new strategy for the next quarter or the next year or the next company that you're going to open or the new coat.

1462
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Whatever you're going to do, there's that and you're planning that.

1463
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Then I want to and and in the military if you're planning an operation, you're putting together a mission that you're going to go do in both those situations.

1464
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I give everyone all the information that I have absolutely.

1465
01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I don't.

1466
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I let them know everything that I know so that they can weigh everything as much as I weigh.

1467
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000
In fact, I want them to toil with the with the information more than I do.

1468
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
So that I can kind of get a fresher look at it when I come in.

1469
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:20.000
So and I think I do and I did see people that would hold back information in those situations, leaders that would hold back information.

1470
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Why would they do that because they're insecure?

1471
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Because knowledge gives you power.

1472
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:32.000
And you use that knowledge to say, you come in and echo's got a good plan put together and I go, yeah, but you've got to think about this right here.

1473
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
And you just say, well, I didn't know that.

1474
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
But it gives me a little bit of leverage, it gives me a little bit of power.

1475
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.000
That's ridiculous. So when it comes to planning and operations and conducting business and planning missions,

1476
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
man share all the information you've got in your organization, now to your organization.

1477
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000
So everybody has the knowledge.

1478
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
That's answer number one.

1479
01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Then we get to the information regarding the leadership of humans.

1480
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000
You do your words like transparency and we got to be honest and you hear those things getting thrown around.

1481
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And of course, no one's going to argue with them.

1482
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Right? No one's going to argue and say, hey, you shouldn't be honest.

1483
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
No one's going to say you shouldn't be transparent, right?

1484
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:25.000
But the fact of the matter is you cannot always share all the information all the time when it comes to leading people.

1485
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
You can't do it.

1486
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:34.000
And here's the problem of why you can't do it because people can't always handle the truth.

1487
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000
And when you give them the truth, they might have a bunch of different reactions, right?

1488
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Some of those reactions being anger and defensiveness.

1489
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:50.000
So in other words, if I tell someone, hey, I'm putting this other person in charge because I don't think you're smarter enough to figure out the solution.

1490
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
That's my true statement. I'm going to be honest with you.

1491
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I don't think you're smart.

1492
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
What is that, too? How does that affect the mission?

1493
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Does it move us closer to the goal?

1494
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Is that person now going to be really supportive of me and work hard knowing that I think they're stupid?

1495
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
The answer is of course not.

1496
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000
I mean, another example is what if you think that your boss's plan is terrible?

1497
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
So you go in there and say, hey, your boss's terrible, your plan that you came up with is awful.

1498
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Now, there might be some bosses that are secure in their leadership and their secure with it.

1499
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
And they go, oh man, why do you think that?

1500
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Here, break it down for me. That's cool.

1501
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
But a lot of bosses are going to be insulted by that.

1502
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
A lot of bosses are going to hurt their ego.

1503
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:41.000
And instead of listening to the idea that you have, instead, they're going to be angered by it.

1504
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
They're going to turn it off. They're going to turn off their minds. They're going to be mad at you.

1505
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
They're not going to listen to you anymore because the way you came across.

1506
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:57.000
So you would have been better off not being quote unquote honest and not sharing all the information.

1507
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:05.000
You would have been better off slowly trying to take the plan that he came up with and maybe maneuver on it or maybe say, hey,

1508
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:11.000
boss, I don't know if that's going to work because of this thing over here, but you'd be tactful.

1509
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
And there's a million examples we could talk of like that.

1510
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And so when it comes to leading people, not operations, not planning missions, but when it comes to leading people, you need to think.

1511
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Think about what you're saying, thinking about how it's going to impact the relationships, up and down the chain of command.

1512
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Think about how it's going to impact the mission because if you're a good leader anywhere on that,

1513
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000
anywhere on that chain of command, if you're a good leader, the most important thing you should be achieving the mission.

1514
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:50.000
So if you're honesty is actually creating adversarial relationships inside your team, what good are you doing, moving the mission forward?

1515
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000
The answer is you're not.

1516
01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:02.000
So I'm not telling you to be dishonest, but I'm telling you to think.

1517
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000
And it's the same thing in your personal life.

1518
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.000
You've got to think about what you're saying. You've got to think about your wife's perspective,

1519
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000
or your husband's perspective, or your kids' perspective, or your friends' perspective.

1520
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:24.000
How is what I'm about to say going to affect them long-term?

1521
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000
You've got to be measured. Now you might give them a little hint of something.

1522
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:38.000
And then see how they react and maybe you could be a little bit more honest with them. Maybe you could throw some bait out there and see if they bite on it.

1523
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:50.000
But you just don't want to jump in or throw it out to where now you've created an adversarial relationship with your friend,

1524
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:56.000
with your spouse, with your kid, because now they're not listening to you.

1525
01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
And with your kids, oh, you got to be totally honest with your kids. Okay. You know what?

1526
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Totally honestly. I don't think you're capable of being this level of an athlete.

1527
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Right? Do they need to hear that when they're nine years old? Probably not.

1528
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Hmm.

1529
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.000
So you just kind of think.

1530
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.000
You got to think. And there's a ways to get that information across

1531
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.000
in a tactical way, in an indirect way, so that it still manages to improve the person.

1532
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Hmm.

1533
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Because I don't want to have echo come up with you come up with a bunch of bad ideas.

1534
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000
And all I do is say, oh, that's a good idea. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. That's a good idea.

1535
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
And train you. I didn't improve you.

1536
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I want to say, hey, you know what? That's not bad. What if we did this? You know what I mean? And so we move in the right direction.

1537
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Hmm.

1538
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
We still have some mentorship going on, but it's indirect. We still have some coaching going on.

1539
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:56.000
But it's indirect because I don't want to coach you and you don't want to be coached by me.

1540
01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000
You even my son.

1541
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:08.000
When I like tell him something in jujitsu, I've been doing jujitsu for over 20 years with some of the best guys in the entire world.

1542
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Hmm.

1543
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.000
And I'll say, hey, Thor, you need to scoot your hip a little bit more and you do that move. And I go, no, you don't.

1544
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Really? No, actually you do it. What he'll listen to Jeff. He'll listen to Dean. Actually, you won't actually have heard him argue with both Jeff and Dean.

1545
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
He's a view of their approach.

1546
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Yeah, maybe he'll be a little more into that.

1547
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Yeah, they're a good man.

1548
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And that kind of illustrates one of the many challenges with that. You know, one of these simple, but not easy things.

1549
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Because everyone's different. How you saying throw something out there to see how they respond. Everyone's going to respond different.

1550
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
That's the thing. So it is kind of this feeling of process.

1551
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:53.000
It's, you know, I think that and I mentioned this before, where you know, some people will be direct, but people don't really like them.

1552
01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And then they they'll kind of double down on it and say, hey, you know, I speak the truth, you know, and like me for who I am or whatever.

1553
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.000
So what you do when you do that when people do that is they render themselves ineffective in situations.

1554
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Now no one's, let's just show exactly right. And guess what, no one's inviting you to their party. No one's to be a friend.

1555
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.000
You know, you may or may not have gotten the divorce from it. And it's all because you, essentially, you just chose to be a dick.

1556
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Look, we all understand that certain things are insulting if you're quote unquote too honest, you know, everyone except you.

1557
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:32.000
You know, if you look around and no one wants to be around you, that's a problem.

1558
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Yeah, news flash.

1559
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.000
You're a jerk. Yes. And the edge and people don't follow jerks.

1560
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:45.000
They really don't. Yeah. So it's not it. It's not honesty is never an excuse to be a jerk to people.

1561
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Yeah. And don't mistake.

1562
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000
You know, people of this kind of misconception that speaking your mind is a good thing.

1563
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
It's not back in white.

1564
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
You're totally right. Don't be like, hey, that's it.

1565
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:10.000
That's it's so crazy about this is like, um, people, I think always have that feeling. I mean, I said it when I was talking, you know, people say, oh, of course honesty is, you know, the best thing you got to be honest.

1566
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And I would say that I am, I am known as a person that is honest and a straight shooter.

1567
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
And that's great.

1568
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:30.000
But at the same time, like you just said, that doesn't mean I run around it in salt people. It means I'm a tactician. You know what?

1569
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
It's not honesty. It's tact. It's being a tactician.

1570
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Because this is something that can actually go too far as well.

1571
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:48.000
If you're constantly always telling everyone thing every all sugar coated, well, now the known and respectful opinion either.

1572
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:56.000
You just hear them saying, if I just say, oh, echo, you did a great job with that video. You did a great job with that video too. You did great. Well, what if you were producing junk videos?

1573
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
I need to tell you. I know it's a rough example.

1574
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I would need to think of something that you didn't do such high quality or pointy thing.

1575
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:12.000
But I've got to, I've got to be honest with you. And if all I do is tell you, hey, it's great. It's great. It's great. It's great. It's great. It's great. It's great. You know, that doesn't help us.

1576
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:21.000
What I need to say is, hey, man, that's an awesome video. It'd be cool if you captured this angle too, right? Or, do you think it'd be possible to get this message across also?

1577
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
And you'd say, oh, I can do anything. You see how I just played during that?

1578
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Did you see how I did that? Yeah.

1579
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Yeah. Like, oh, do you think it's even possible to get this angle in there?

1580
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Oh, yeah, I could make it come across strong.

1581
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Dang. I didn't even know there was a fight.

1582
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000
You didn't just want to, I just had a little bit of a injury up in here.

1583
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Yeah. So it's not black and white. You know, or like everything, it's a balance. It's a balance.

1584
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:50.000
It's a black codomy. Yes. It's a codomy between telling the truth and being taxful.

1585
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Yeah.

1586
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Next question.

1587
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Jocco, how do you handle it when someone up the chain of command?

1588
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Be trays, trust.

1589
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Like, what is this like lying? They lied to you.

1590
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Yeah, well, this could be, this is a huge, this is a huge spectrum of things.

1591
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000
I guess. So for number one, you just learned.

1592
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Right. You just learned something about someone's character.

1593
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Yeah. You now kind of know better what you're dealing with.

1594
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Now, if this is a major situation, you might have to immediately confront it and or go above them in the chain of command.

1595
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I mean, if there's lives at risk, if there's something morally wrong that is happening,

1596
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
if there's something illegal that's happening, that now you're going to get wrapped into.

1597
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000
And that's another decision you got to make. If you're not going to be wrapped into it, then it's a decision you got to make.

1598
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000
If you want to ruin this person's life, whatever. That's a different decision.

1599
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
That's not this question. We'd have to deal with that in a separate question.

1600
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Are innocent people being hurt?

1601
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
So if it's something like that, lives at risk, something morally wrong is happening.

1602
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Something illegal is happening.

1603
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Innocent people being hurt, then you're probably going to have to say something.

1604
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
You're going to have to say something.

1605
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Now, I would say this before you say something.

1606
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Make sure all your ducks in a row, make sure you have evidence.

1607
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Don't go off half cock to be ready because people that are deceitful like this.

1608
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:25.000
They prepare. They are ready for battle to protect themselves and they don't care what happens to other people.

1609
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:31.000
So you're going to watch out for that. Now, if it's something minor, you know, if it's something minor,

1610
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.000
then that's something that you log down in the brain.

1611
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Something that you log down in the brain.

1612
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000
And, um,

1613
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
but it allows you to see person's character.

1614
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:54.000
And that means again, it's a minor infraction, but it also means you've got to watch yourself and you've got to watch them a little bit more closely.

1615
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
You've got to be careful because people like that.

1616
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
They think they're smarter than everyone else.

1617
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
They think that they're getting away with life.

1618
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:12.000
So they think they're smarter and there's like a little hint of social path in there that they can get away with these lies.

1619
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
And so you've got to watch them.

1620
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000
You got to watch them carefully.

1621
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000
And like I said, it kind of goes back to that previous question.

1622
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Because you don't want to be a person that comes across as dishonest yourself.

1623
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000
And if people don't think they can trust what you're saying, they're not going to trust you.

1624
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
With other things.

1625
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:43.000
So if you know I'm not giving you good feedback because I'm too nice, you're not going to start.

1626
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
You're not going to respect my opinion anymore.

1627
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.000
So, you know, when you're when you're dealing with someone, if someone comes to you instead of again,

1628
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:58.000
this is honesty versus dishonest. If you come to me and say, hey, what do you think of this plan?

1629
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.000
I'm not going to say, I think that's a stupid plan.

1630
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I might say, I don't know if that's how I do it. I might try this approach, right?

1631
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:14.000
You're just going to be diplomatic if you, if I'm not going to say to you, I don't think you're smarter enough to figure this out.

1632
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
I want to move you to a different division because I don't think you're smarter enough to solve this problem.

1633
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I'm not going to say that.

1634
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.000
I'm going to say, you know what? I need you on this other project over here that I think you're going to be really knock this thing out of the park.

1635
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Now you're going to know deep inside.

1636
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.000
But it's called tact.

1637
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
And that's what you have to use.

1638
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:43.000
But back to the honesty or when person betrays your trust, you've learned, you've learned about their character.

1639
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000
If it's a big thing, you're going to have to talk about it. You're going to have to tell somebody.

1640
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000
It's a little thing.

1641
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
You got to watch.

1642
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Kivie, I think we just learned that vocabulary tonight.

1643
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Who's there? Watch.

1644
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Yeah.

1645
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
You know how you see? And you log it in your brain.

1646
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Right. Logging in your brain. That okay. They lied about that.

1647
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Or oh, I. And I think you should constantly do that.

1648
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Right. And I think we all do that anyway. That's really, I think that's why.

1649
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.000
And your brain has certain ways just the way it's wired. Like first impressions.

1650
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Right. That's usually a big thing.

1651
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.000
But really what's really going on isn't that the first impression is this has more weight,

1652
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000
specifically than other impressions that you get along the line.

1653
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000
It's because let's say you don't, let's say I don't know that much about you.

1654
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
I don't know. Really, this is the first time I've ever met you heard about you, whatever.

1655
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Your first impression is not that it's so heavy. It's just it's the only impression.

1656
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000
So it seems like everything. If you're addicted to me, okay, you're addicted.

1657
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
In my mind, you're just addicted.

1658
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Second day, you're not addicted. You're 50% addicted, which is that still addicted.

1659
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
You know, even if you're 20% addicted, you're like, okay, I like on buddy still addicted.

1660
01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000
You know, so again, my point is you're always logging stuff in your brain.

1661
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000
What is this person? What is this person? Not when it comes to someone who betrayed your trust.

1662
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000
This doesn't really count them out as far as trusting them.

1663
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Because a lot of times the more time you spend with them, the more experience you have with them,

1664
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000
you start to get a picture of, okay, he'll be trained by trust in this case, in this type of situation.

1665
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000
It's like if you have a friend who he would literally risk his life to save your life,

1666
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000
but at the same time, he would probably hook up with your wife.

1667
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.000
If you had the opportunity, you know, so there's different kind of things.

1668
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.000
So as you gain experience with people, he is therefore risking his own life.

1669
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
That's a true story.

1670
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Sure, of course. But you start to get a picture of who the person is.

1671
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
And I don't have any friends like that.

1672
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000
But I do know what you're saying.

1673
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Yes.

1674
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:54.000
People that have different moral compass and moral values, and so you're judging them based on that.

1675
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Right.

1676
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Yes. So just be careful not to judge a Mason.

1677
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
That's all.

1678
01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
We're talking about the point.

1679
01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000
We're talking about the point.

1680
01:43:59.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Yes.

1681
01:43:59.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Yes.

1682
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
But that's part of this big picture.

1683
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000
So, because ultimately you want to get to the point,

1684
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
and I've had this experience specifically in my life before where

1685
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
you know, you want to get to the point where you trust them.

1686
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Yeah, I trust them to be that person.

1687
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
You know, I know he's not trustworthy in this, but he's trustworthy.

1688
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
So yeah, he's role in my life or in this company or whatever.

1689
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000
I know.

1690
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I trust him to be him.

1691
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Therefore, I won't give him this task.

1692
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
You trust him to be them.

1693
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Yes, exactly right.

1694
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I trust the scorpion to be the scorpion.

1695
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Exactly.

1696
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
The frog to be the frog.

1697
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Yes.

1698
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
And that comes with like the experience.

1699
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
So if someone, you know, if it's like you said if it's a minor thing,

1700
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000
don't go jumped on his throat or just jumped to this thing,

1701
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000
really just be like, okay, you know, deal with it in your way,

1702
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
but like I said, log in in your brain and move forward.

1703
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
What, you know, and keep your eyes open to things that you can trust more about.

1704
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Yeah, and get that full picture.

1705
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
And I hate to say this enough set of before.

1706
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I don't have these massively high expectations of other human beings.

1707
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Yeah.

1708
01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.000
I hate to say it, but I'm kind of anticipating that they're telling me half truths.

1709
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Yeah.

1710
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Yeah.

1711
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:08.000
So don't get these high expectations and expect that people are going to try and get one over on you.

1712
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Yeah.

1713
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
And then when you do get your core of people that you know are really truly trustworthy,

1714
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
that's awesome.

1715
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Yeah.

1716
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
That might be three people in your life.

1717
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Yeah.

1718
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Yeah.

1719
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And that's, I would say that that's fair.

1720
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.000
You know, I think a lot of people are like that.

1721
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And I think everyone's like that in one way or another.

1722
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
You know, and it's a spectrum.

1723
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000
But I've been in a situation where,

1724
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
So when say, hey, do you know this guy?

1725
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I'm going to be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1726
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
They'll be like, yeah, are your friends with that guy?

1727
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Like, isn't he hard to trust because of like this?

1728
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
And I'll say, I don't find him hard to trust.

1729
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I trust him to be him.

1730
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000
And just exactly how you're saying you trust the scorpion to be a scorpion.

1731
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Yeah.

1732
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.000
You know, scorpion can be relied upon for specific things and straight up can't be relied upon for certain other things.

1733
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000
So again, if you just keep your eyes open and you know,

1734
01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000
don't start burning bridges with the person if it's this small thing.

1735
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.000
As time goes on, you can start to get a feel of really who this person is in the entirety.

1736
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
And it might be beneficial in the situation you're in with them.

1737
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Know your people.

1738
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I agree.

1739
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Next question.

1740
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Here's a strange one.

1741
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:26.000
I have ongoing regret for never joining the military or police department.

1742
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.000
And I'm not yet strong enough to consider changing careers now for financial reasons.

1743
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I also don't know how to discuss this with my wife as we want to make some additions to the family soon.

1744
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I feel unfifilled in the single aspect of my life.

1745
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.000
It's a strange feeling, considering I have skyrocketed up the chain in my company.

1746
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000
So quickly.

1747
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
So many would do anything to be where I find myself.

1748
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000
How do you overcome your face or how do you overcome or face your son?

1749
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Or face yourself knowing you're holding back from a certain calling?

1750
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Because I really do see it as a calling in some form.

1751
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I'm interested to hear from you.

1752
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I think this is pretty easy.

1753
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Go join the reserves.

1754
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Go join the reserves.

1755
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Go in the army reserves.

1756
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Go in the like every branch has some reserves.

1757
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Where you're going to do one weekend a month.

1758
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
You have to do boot camp.

1759
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
That'll be whatever it's going to be.

1760
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
10 weeks, 12 weeks, 14 weeks depending on which branch you go into.

1761
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
And then you do one week and a month.

1762
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
And you do two weeks in the summer.

1763
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
You'll understand what the military is about.

1764
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
There's actually a chance.

1765
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Well, first of all, there's a chance to be deployed.

1766
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I mean, when we were in Iraq, you know, when we deployed to Ramadi,

1767
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000
my second deployment to Iraq, the unit that was there, the 228 iron soldiers.

1768
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
They were reserved, you need out of Pennsylvania.

1769
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
They were awesome.

1770
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
They've been there for 14 months.

1771
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
And they lost a lot of guys and they fought hard.

1772
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.000
So it's not like this reserveist thing is is is a different class of soldier.

1773
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
They're soldiers for real.

1774
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
They're Marines for real.

1775
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
And you may be going on deployment.

1776
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.000
But what's cool about it is most companies, they will excuse you,

1777
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
basically, when you go in the reserves.

1778
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
They'll excuse you when you have time.

1779
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
In fact, I think it's, I was never in the reserves.

1780
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000
But I think you're actually protected by the federal government from being fired

1781
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
because you're serving in the reserves.

1782
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.000
So I would definitely go and look into the reserves because otherwise,

1783
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000
that feeling that you have, I can only imagine it's never going to go away.

1784
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I don't know because I had that feeling that I wanted to join the military

1785
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000
when I was four years old and I did it, it seems like turned 18.

1786
01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.000
So I don't, you know, I, you know what I regret now is like,

1787
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
I want to still be in, you know?

1788
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.000
So especially now with the fighting picking up overseas,

1789
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:53.000
it's, you know, that's the only thing that, that I feel is damn.

1790
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
I want to go back.

1791
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
But if you never did it at all, that's a grinding feeling.

1792
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000
So go, talk to recruiter, get the reserves and you know what else.

1793
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000
In certain areas, there's definitely volunteer, fired apartments.

1794
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
And you can volunteer as a fireman.

1795
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
And you can volunteer as a policeman.

1796
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000
They have certain, I don't know, I have no idea what state you're from.

1797
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Asking a question, but there's deputies, you can get deputized,

1798
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000
you can go through a, in San Diego, they definitely have reserve cops,

1799
01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000
where you have to go to, you have to go to the, the police academy,

1800
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
and you become a reserve cop.

1801
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
So, and with all that, you want to talk about it with your wife,

1802
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
talk about it with your wife.

1803
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Yeah.

1804
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000
You know, you say you don't know how to.

1805
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
This is in the situation where you can be totally honest with it.

1806
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Hey, I always wanted to join the military.

1807
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I haven't done it.

1808
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I feel like it's something I really want to do.

1809
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Here's the options I want to go look at.

1810
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000
What do you think?

1811
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Now, you're marrying, you married to a girl and you're going to have kids.

1812
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
It's your military service.

1813
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
We'll be hard-grown, her, then, it is on you.

1814
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
So, she better be strong, she better be tough.

1815
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And, you know, the military wives out there.

1816
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000
I mean, my wife, when I was gone and deployment after deployment,

1817
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
it's, it's not easy.

1818
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
I mean, luckily, she's tough.

1819
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000
And she raised kids without me.

1820
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000
And she took care of household without me.

1821
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000
And she went to the hospital to visit my wounded guys.

1822
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
And she went to the funeral of my guys, but we're getting killed.

1823
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
And she had to do that while I was gone on deployment.

1824
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
And I was she was here for me once a week, maybe.

1825
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
So, you're going to put your family through a lot of stress.

1826
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Now, you might stress your family a lot by always having regret

1827
01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
that they held you back.

1828
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Mm.

1829
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
That's selfish, but that's true.

1830
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000
So, I would just go look into it, see what the options are.

1831
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Talk about it with your wife.

1832
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
There's some really good benefits to it.

1833
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000
And also, the final point is sometimes when you're

1834
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000
reservist, you can decide that you want to go act of duty.

1835
01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Maybe you love it.

1836
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Maybe you say, yeah, this was my calling.

1837
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Maybe your fourth day in boot camp, where you haven't slept,

1838
01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.000
you had your head shaved, your tired, your hungry, the food is horrible.

1839
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
And you say, man, this is what I've always wanted to do with my life.

1840
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
And if that happens, there's options where you can now go

1841
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000
active duty.

1842
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
And you can see how your wife dealt with it while you're gone.

1843
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
And if she dealt with it well, that's great.

1844
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Hey, let's make a career out of this.

1845
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
And that's a good option to do.

1846
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.000
So, I think your, this is, this is an easy day.

1847
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Easy, easy problem to take care of.

1848
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Mm.

1849
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
No factor.

1850
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Just a second.

1851
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Next question.

1852
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Juggle, what's your take on sport?

1853
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Jiu Jitsu versus self defense, Jiu Jitsu.

1854
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000
And can sport transport, Jiu Jitsu can translate onto the street.

1855
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Most schools are geared towards sport.

1856
01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Yeah, so for anyone that's listening that doesn't do Jiu Jitsu, both of you

1857
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
without or out there that don't do Jiu Jitsu, that listening.

1858
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
First of all, do Jiu Jitsu.

1859
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Second of all, so there's, there's,

1860
01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Jiu Jitsu is rooted really in self defense.

1861
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.000
And like anything that gets put into a,

1862
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:13.000
a closed environment, it starts to breed and become different and mutate.

1863
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:19.000
And so, Jiu Jitsu in a way, what they call, what they now call sport, Jiu Jitsu,

1864
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:25.000
is Jiu Jitsu that has been in this competition environment in the Jiu Jitsu sport competition environment.

1865
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
So, Jiu Jitsu is a sport as well as self defense.

1866
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:32.000
It's a sport with points and you can win on points and they have championships and it's very competitive.

1867
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:37.000
And it's, it's pretty entertaining to watch if you know and understand the game.

1868
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:45.000
But since it's in this environment, this closed environment, it starts to mutate.

1869
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
And that's what's happened.

1870
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:52.000
So, for instance, there's maneuvers that you do in sport, Jiu Jitsu,

1871
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.000
that are so intricate.

1872
01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:01.000
And there's so reliant on, for instance, reliant on the ghee,

1873
01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:06.000
the Jiu Jitsu uniform, which is a heavy fabric, a ghee.

1874
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000
And you can actually use parts of the ghee to choke people.

1875
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
And you can use parts of the ghee to,

1876
01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000
make a person off balance called a sweep and get on top.

1877
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:24.000
You can literally take the lapel of their ghee and put it between their legs and wrap it around your leg and then grab the ghee there.

1878
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000
And then you just swing your hips and it's going to pull them off balance.

1879
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Now this is something you could literally never do in the street.

1880
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.000
So that's what they're talking about when they're talking about sport versus self defense.

1881
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
And they have this with other things.

1882
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000
I mean, there's sport shooting where they do certain.

1883
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.000
And it's semi-realistic, just like Jiu Jitsu, semi-realistic when you go in a tournament,

1884
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
it's somewhat simulate a street fight,

1885
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:54.000
just like some shooting competitions somewhat simulate combat,

1886
01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
but they're not exact.

1887
01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.000
And so the question is, does the sport translate onto the street?

1888
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.000
And my answer to that is, first of all, yes, it does.

1889
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Not every move certainly, and there's absolutely moves that you would do in Jiu Jitsu in a tournament that you would never do on the street.

1890
01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Now luckily, anybody who's good enough to do those advanced moves in a tournament is good enough that in the street.

1891
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
They're not going to need those moves.

1892
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000
You're not going to need to do a reverse, oh my plaza in the street.

1893
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:34.000
You're not going to need to do donkey guard in the street.

1894
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000
You're not going to need to do barimbollo in the street.

1895
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
You're just not going to need to do it.

1896
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
If you're fighting someone that's good, well then guess what?

1897
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000
I guess you did need it, but you're not going to come up against a person in the street.

1898
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000
That's going to have a counter to your barimbollo attack.

1899
01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
And you don't have a guillain, so that's not going to work.

1900
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000
I mean, there are some no guivers that the bottom line is.

1901
01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000
If you're doing Jiu Jitsu, you're definitely going to do very, very well in a street fight.

1902
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Now that being said, that being said, sometimes you know what you got to do.

1903
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000
You got to train Jiu Jitsu for the street.

1904
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
You got to punch each other occasionally.

1905
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
You got to say, hey, you know what?

1906
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Let's go live a little bit and we'll do some maybe you put gloves on, maybe you put MMA gloves on,

1907
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000
maybe just use open hands and you smack each other.

1908
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000
And you realize like, oh, when I'm on the bottom in the half guard,

1909
01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000
where I feel super comfortable when I'm doing Jiu Jitsu, if I'm in a real fight,

1910
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
I'm going to be getting headbutted or I'm going to be getting punched in the face.

1911
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
And that's not good.

1912
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
So what do I do to get out of this?

1913
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Um, you know, even in the guard can be horrible on the bottom.

1914
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
And you don't want to be on the bottom anyways in the fight.

1915
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000
You don't want to, you don't, the bottom line is you don't want to grapple if you don't have to.

1916
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000
You don't want to be in a street fight in the first place.

1917
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
The reason you're in a street fight is because you could not avoid it.

1918
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
That's why you're in a street fight.

1919
01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
You could not avoid it.

1920
01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000
You got attacked.

1921
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
You got taken down to the ground.

1922
01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Because even if someone swings at you, you can get still get away from you.

1923
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
They haven't grabbed you yet. Run away.

1924
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Cool.

1925
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:14.000
So train Jiu Jitsu with punches, also train boxing more time wrestling.

1926
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000
And also work on some real scenarios.

1927
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Work on the headlock.

1928
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.000
And I've seen this where you get a guy that's really just coming to the game and jump straight.

1929
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000
You know, these young kids, they come to the game and they start the first thing they want to learn is the rubber guard.

1930
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.000
The first thing they want to learn is the umo plot of the first thing they want to learn is the baron bolo.

1931
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
That's like the first thing they want to learn.

1932
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000
And literally someone will put them in a headlock and they won't know what to do.

1933
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Because it's different.

1934
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Just like a baron bolo requires to neck technique.

1935
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000
The headlock escape requires some technique to get out of that.

1936
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:58.000
So work on that, work on the bear hug, work on the arm grab and the wrist grab and the the the straight arm choke.

1937
01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.000
And big looping punches that you're going to see and I'll tell you sometimes Dean will teach yourself the fence class.

1938
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.000
And when Dean teaches yourself the fence class every time he teaches one I learned something.

1939
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:14.000
I'm like man, that's a good little technique he just showed how to get out of this, how to get out of that.

1940
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:24.000
So bottom line, yes, you can it it sport Jiu Jitsu for the most part,

1941
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:34.000
the most part, the trams lights into the street and if you're good enough at sports Jiu Jitsu that you're competing at a high level even purple belt nup.

1942
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
You're not going to need to use any sports Jitsu moves in the street.

1943
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
You're going to be destroying someone in a street fight.

1944
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Yeah.

1945
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
If you end up in that situation.

1946
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Yeah, the it's a spec especially now just like how are you saying the Jiu Jitsu has evolved and kind of mutated more in in the gyms now.

1947
01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Yeah, a Petri dish.

1948
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Jiu Jitsu is like in a Petri dish.

1949
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
It's growing.

1950
01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
It just grows on its own.

1951
01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
It turns this weird fungus and it gets all different looking.

1952
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Yeah.

1953
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000
And it does look different.

1954
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Yeah.

1955
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
It does look different than it did.

1956
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.000
You know, even like I remember I remember Dean when I were talking about the other day we remember when the

1957
01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Uma plot I came out.

1958
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:16.000
You know, I think it was you know like 1996 we started seeing the Uma plot and we were oh man.

1959
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000
And it looks very fancy.

1960
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Yeah.

1961
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
It looks very because a fancy looking move.

1962
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Yeah.

1963
01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:27.000
And now now because the internet because so many people are it's exploding how rapidly it's changing and mutating.

1964
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
It's mutating faster now than it ever has.

1965
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Yeah.

1966
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Yeah.

1967
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000
And that's it's part of the beauty of it.

1968
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
I think in, you know, in most ways.

1969
01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
The it's a spectrum.

1970
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000
No right.

1971
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:43.000
If you went from one side, which is just the basic the original basic, you know, take down Mount

1972
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Side Mount card all this all the way to worm guard something that that we're very

1973
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
stable for example, we're so smart.

1974
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000
You do it.

1975
01:58:52.000 --> 01:59:02.000
If you want to narrow it down, it's it's it's if it's something where the moves or whatever you're doing is dependent on the sport elements of it.

1976
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
So it's dependent that you have a mat.

1977
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000
It's dependent that you have a key and a belt.

1978
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:13.000
So if you do worm guard, that's highly dependent on the guy having a key with the lapel out.

1979
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000
And eventually someone's going to figure out how to do worm guard without it.

1980
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
They'll figure out some variation for sure.

1981
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Yeah, yeah, so it's your keenens working on it.

1982
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1983
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:27.000
So it's like, you know, just to kind of put it into defined terms.

1984
01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:41.000
So self defense, I think now is you may find a gym that's only does sport where if you came in no experience and then, you know, three, four, five years later,

1985
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000
your sport you did to might not take you very far in the street.

1986
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:49.000
It's it'll be rare, I think, but you could probably find the school like that.

1987
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:54.000
I don't know where they are, but but I think just like how you're saying, when you make it to purple belt,

1988
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:58.000
you're the basic jujitsu will win on the street.

1989
01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:03.000
And really, when if you go to a school like even the original Gracie Academy of Torrance, if you go there,

1990
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:11.000
the self the self defense pursuit in jujitsu is more of it is it's tactic based like mentally.

1991
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:17.000
It's not specific moves, it's distance management, it's where your mindset is.

1992
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:25.000
In the guard your your pursue your goal in the guard is way different than in a tournament or something.

1993
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000
They won't they'll say don't even go for a submission's right there.

1994
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
It's not your job to do submissions right here.

1995
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
I was going to say that you said it's dependent on the ghee.

1996
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
It's to sport you just depend on the ghee, dependent on the mat.

1997
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.000
It's also dependent on the rules and it's dependent on an opponent that knows jujitsu.

1998
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Yeah, it's dependent on somebody that knows what they're doing because they're going to counter what you're doing and it'll make something work.

1999
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Absolutely right. Yeah.

2000
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:51.000
So if you go back to the self defense, you're going to be learning basically how to protect yourself,

2001
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
given what jujitsu is.

2002
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.000
That's that's it. In sport, you're going to be learning how to score points,

2003
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:05.000
how to control a certain guy with this specific uniform, how to utilize that uniform, how to utilize the mat.

2004
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.000
That's another thing that's messed up like in the IBJJF, so the official rules of jujitsu.

2005
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.000
There's some things that you're not allowed to do.

2006
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Right. And that's not good. They should allow these things.

2007
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Right. In regards to pursuing self defense.

2008
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Yes.

2009
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000
The sport, the sport is a sport. Really when it comes down to it.

2010
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Yeah, I guess you can put whatever rules you want.

2011
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Yeah.

2012
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000
But you shouldn't.

2013
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Yeah.

2014
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Yeah. If you, if you don't mind the deviation from self defense, if you don't mind that,

2015
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000
you can put whatever rules you want. But yeah, I would say you shouldn't.

2016
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:43.000
If you care about the more rules you put in the sport of which it's the less effective it becomes.

2017
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Unfortunately. That's what they need to stop with the rules.

2018
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Yeah.

2019
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000
And it's the same thing with jujudo, it's the same thing with wrestling.

2020
02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I mean wrestling in America, if they allowed submission holds in wrestling in America,

2021
02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.000
you know, America would be insane with fighters.

2022
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:03.000
We've done pretty good. But can you imagine if every high school kid that wrestled new out of do all submissions?

2023
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000
To be nuts. That's a way it should be. I wish it was that way.

2024
02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I wish the world was that way.

2025
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
It would be a better place.

2026
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
But what they did is what they did is with wrestling.

2027
02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:18.000
They took submission holds out because they considered it to be dangerous.

2028
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Yeah.

2029
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.000
In judo as a clock is a classic example where they remove the double leg.

2030
02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Like you can't do a straight double leg in a tournament anymore.

2031
02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.000
You have to set it up. It has to be off something else because

2032
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:34.000
wrestlers will come in and dominating in judo tournaments just hit and double legs because they're, because they're awesome at them.

2033
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Right.

2034
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.000
And it's the same thing now you see with with jujitsu and IBJJF.

2035
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000
There, you know, with the with the no heal hooks.

2036
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Yeah.

2037
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Even at a black belt level, you're not allowed to do heal hooks.

2038
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
That completely changes some parts of the games.

2039
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:53.000
And it doesn't change in where it would's going to make you lose in a street fight.

2040
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000
But it definitely puts a stop to the to the growth of the sport in terms of technique.

2041
02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Yeah.

2042
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Yeah. Exactly. So exactly what you're saying now.

2043
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:09.000
The sport, the rules and stuff. All that does is is narrow down the sport part of it.

2044
02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000
And the more people who pursue it for sport, not just sport, but sport.

2045
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000
If pursuing judo to the first sport is part of your game is part of your goals or whatever.

2046
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:24.000
And then now the sport has become this limited thing where you can't like this 20% of moves you can't do.

2047
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
You're going to spend way less than practicing them.

2048
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:32.000
You'd be way less effective at these moves that are a part of grappling a huge part of grappling ultimately.

2049
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000
So, so yeah, you're still going to have that huge overlap.

2050
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000
For sure. If you know mount, which is probably the first thing you would have your first judo class.

2051
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.000
You're going to learn mount, which is theoretically the most dominant position you can have.

2052
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:50.000
So you're going to learn mount, what to do when the guy flips you over, what to do in the guard, how to function.

2053
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000
You know, these things, that's what's going to get you by industry.

2054
02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:58.000
That's what's going to make you effective in an actual fight.

2055
02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Yeah.

2056
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:05.000
And then, you know, like anything, all these offsuits that grow, you know, they, you know, there's some overlap for sure.

2057
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000
But if you go in an tournament, that's a specific pursuit.

2058
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000
If you want to defend yourself, that's a specific pursuit.

2059
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Now, and as time goes on, they're going to start to draw out.

2060
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
There's a lot of overlap right now.

2061
02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Yes.

2062
02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000
And in the future, there'll be less.

2063
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Yes.

2064
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.000
As the way that they're putting rules over the sport.

2065
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Yeah.

2066
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
And just, and just sport in general.

2067
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.000
And the sport mutating.

2068
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Yeah.

2069
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Yeah.

2070
02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000
So, you know, the sport depending on the, depending on the fact that there's a mat.

2071
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Like if you try to do a bar and bow in the street with chaos on the road or something.

2072
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Or just the way that you make it, when you spin on the mat.

2073
02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Yeah.

2074
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Which friction on the street would be definitely not what would make it hard.

2075
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Yes.

2076
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000
You can put even the grass would make it hard.

2077
02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Yeah.

2078
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
I haven't tried to bear them both on the street.

2079
02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000
I can't get a fight.

2080
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Yeah.

2081
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
But both are good.

2082
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000
I think it's fun.

2083
02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.000
You can't help but really like, because, because when you go in due to your, like,

2084
02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Okay, this is basically a fight.

2085
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Yeah.

2086
02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
And we can train full speed and be safe.

2087
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
It's a fight.

2088
02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:08.000
That's what makes it so fun because the, when you win, the payoff is so good on the inside.

2089
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000
And when you lose it's like, you still get that detriment that's still,

2090
02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
you still have that feeling, but at the end of the day, you know, you lived.

2091
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.000
You're not enemies with the guy.

2092
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.000
You're not injured.

2093
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Nothing like that.

2094
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000
So it makes it this, this win win the whole time, right?

2095
02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And when you see a cool move like warm guard, when like, you're controlling one guy with your weird foot,

2096
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000
that face this way in one hand.

2097
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
And the guy can't, like, even stand up.

2098
02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Yeah.

2099
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.000
That's so fun.

2100
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Yeah.

2101
02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
It's like, oh, I have a superpower on wielding, you know, in the mat.

2102
02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
So you can't help but pursue those fun.

2103
02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Think bar and bow.

2104
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
You get it's like your a break dancer doing some cool stuff.

2105
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Meanwhile, you're dominating the guy while you're doing.

2106
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
You can't help but do that stuff.

2107
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
So fun, you know.

2108
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Yeah.

2109
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.000
So you can't, I mean, I don't think you can really hate on the sport.

2110
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.000
No, I don't.

2111
02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I don't hate on the sport.

2112
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Yeah.

2113
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
You can't.

2114
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2115
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000
I'm saying good, but some people do.

2116
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Yeah.

2117
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000
You know how, even just the question cut, not that the person who has this question,

2118
02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000
thinks this, but it implies that there is a little bit of a climate of, oh, yeah.

2119
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000
I got to say this.

2120
02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000
If you don't like the bar and bow, we'll learn to defend against it.

2121
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
No, yeah.

2122
02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000
You know what I mean?

2123
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
You don't like rubber guard cool learn to defend against it.

2124
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000
That's my opinion because if you're working, then credit.

2125
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000
You know, you either affected or ineffective.

2126
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
My brother, late, Babon said, oh.

2127
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I think the time is, yeah, it's 21 more or one more.

2128
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Okay.

2129
02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Jocco, a lot of your advice applies to leading yourself, not just leading others.

2130
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Self-help, quote unquote, is a loaded word.

2131
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
So let's say self-management.

2132
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:45.000
What is the one change readers should make today to start improving themselves and their situation?

2133
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000
I don't really like those words.

2134
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Self-help or self-management or self-improvement.

2135
02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000
I don't really like what those words have come to mean these days.

2136
02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Because there's a lot of people out there that are constantly trying to improve themselves.

2137
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:09.000
By looking for the one change, the one change, right?

2138
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:15.000
The one change in their life that's going to make their dreams come true.

2139
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:19.000
And even worse, on top of that, there's a lot of people out there.

2140
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:32.000
A lot of self-help gurus and these hyperactive motivational speakers and these other self-appointed modern Zen yoga warriors that they're trying to sell the one thing.

2141
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:42.000
They're trying to sell the nine steps or the enlightened path that's going to allow you to unlock all of your human potential and fulfill the dreams.

2142
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:48.000
So you can live the life that you've always wanted to live.

2143
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Now, I'm no guru.

2144
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000
And I definitely don't claim to be.

2145
02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
I'm just a man.

2146
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:03.000
But I will tell you this. It isn't one thing.

2147
02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.000
And it isn't ten things. And it isn't a hundred things.

2148
02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:12.000
It is an a quick path and there are no shortcuts.

2149
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Meditation won't get you there.

2150
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:23.000
And neither will a miracle drug or an organic supplement or some superfood.

2151
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Getting better is an hack or a trick or a one change that you need to make.

2152
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Getting better is a campaign.

2153
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:40.000
It's a campaign. It's a daily, a weekly, it's an hourly fight.

2154
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:47.000
An insessing fight that doesn't stop against weakness and against temptation and against laziness.

2155
02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000
It's a campaign of discipline.

2156
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.000
The campaign of hard work and dedication.

2157
02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:59.000
It's waking up early and going to bed late and grinding out every second in between.

2158
02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.000
Every single day.

2159
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:08.000
So you want to get better?

2160
02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.000
You want to self-improve.

2161
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Stop looking for a shortcut and go find your alarm clock and find your discipline.

2162
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:28.000
And think your guts and your passion and your drive and find you will.

2163
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:39.000
And then you will find your freedom.

2164
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.000
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2165
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:48.000
So all you troopers out there.

2166
02:09:48.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I don't know if I'm finding against evil or fighting against crime or fighting against fires or fighting to make things happen.

2167
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Fighting to get ahead and make something out of this little bit of time that we've got.

2168
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Thanks for joining us in the fight.

2169
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.000
If you want to keep the conversation going, you can find us on the inner webs.

2170
02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.000
I'm at Jocco-Willink and Echo is at Echo Charles.

2171
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000
And if you want to support the podcast, Echo is going to tell you how.

2172
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Just a few ways.

2173
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Easy as way.

2174
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.000
You click on there and then you do shopping.

2175
02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Whether you buy a book or whatever or some batteries or some duct tape.

2176
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Also, there is a Jocco store where you can get shirts or coffee mugs or stickers.

2177
02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:00.000
You can support us by doing that if you like the shirts.

2178
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
If not, then obviously not.

2179
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:08.000
And if you want to take some supplements, I recommend the good ones, the ones that actually work.

2180
02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
And those are made by on it.

2181
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:17.000
So if you go to onit.com slash Jocco, you can get 10% off all supplements.

2182
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:24.000
You can also support the podcast by listening to it, by downloading it, by subscribing to it.

2183
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:29.000
And by reviewing it, wherever you listen to it, get on there and put a review on there.

2184
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Tell people what you think.

2185
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:38.000
You can also get a book called Extreme Ownership that was written by myself and my brother,

2186
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Lave Babin.

2187
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:44.000
And you can get it on digital hardcover.

2188
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:51.000
You can get it on audio, which is actually read by Lave Babin and myself.

2189
02:11:51.000 --> 02:12:00.000
And when you get done, support in the podcast and supporting the cause here,

2190
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:09.000
go out there and do something to support yourself to make yourself better,

2191
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:18.000
get out there into the world and get after it.

2192
02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:24.000
And so, until next time, this is Jocco, Neko.

2193
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Out.
