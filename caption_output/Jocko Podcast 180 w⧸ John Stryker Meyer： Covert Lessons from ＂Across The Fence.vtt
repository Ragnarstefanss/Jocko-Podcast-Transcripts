00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.30
This is Jockel Podcast number 180.

2
00:00:03.30 --> 00:00:06.04
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:06.04 --> 00:00:08.64
Good evening, echo. Good evening.

4
00:00:08.64 --> 00:00:13.20
It was May 1968.

5
00:00:13.20 --> 00:00:16.40
We were triple volunteers.

6
00:00:16.40 --> 00:00:21.76
We had volunteered and graduated from the Army's parachute jump school at Fort Benning, Georgia.

7
00:00:21.76 --> 00:00:27.12
Made it through the qualification course at the Special Forces Training Group in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

8
00:00:27.12 --> 00:00:32.48
And after attending the fifth Special Forces Group airborne in-country training program,

9
00:00:32.48 --> 00:00:39.08
we had volunteered to serve in Mac V. Sogs, Command and Control.

10
00:00:39.08 --> 00:00:43.60
During Special Forces Training at Fort Bragg, several of the green berets teaching various

11
00:00:43.60 --> 00:00:50.92
courses told us to avoid C and C because the duty was rough and the Special Forces casualties

12
00:00:50.92 --> 00:00:55.20
were high in the top secret unit.

13
00:00:55.20 --> 00:01:03.60
Despite all those warnings, Rick Howard, John McIntyre, Rick Estes, Tony Horell, Mark

14
00:01:03.60 --> 00:01:13.32
Gentry, Bob Garcia, Bobby D. Letters, myself and a few others volunteered to serve in C and C.

15
00:01:13.32 --> 00:01:18.28
I'd been in training or in between training cycles since entering the Army on one December

16
00:01:18.28 --> 00:01:26.32
1966. In May 1968, we were finally shifting gears from being in a training mode to an operational

17
00:01:26.32 --> 00:01:32.24
mode. None of the rumors prepared us for what followed.

18
00:01:32.24 --> 00:01:37.88
You won't need those. The sergeant major said, put away all pens, pencils and notebooks.

19
00:01:37.88 --> 00:01:42.24
This is a top secret briefing. All of you have either obtained a top secret clearance or

20
00:01:42.24 --> 00:01:46.80
will do so in the near future or you wouldn't be here.

21
00:01:46.80 --> 00:01:50.76
Welcome to the Command and Control Detachment of the Fifth Special Forces Group Airborne.

22
00:01:50.76 --> 00:01:56.20
First Special Forces United States Army Special Operations Augmentation Study and Observation

23
00:01:56.20 --> 00:02:00.80
Group or simply C and C.

24
00:02:00.80 --> 00:02:06.48
Gentlemen, before you is a confidentiality agreement. You can't tell your girlfriend, your

25
00:02:06.48 --> 00:02:10.16
mother, no one.

26
00:02:10.16 --> 00:02:14.20
We were prohibited from writing anything about the operation forbidden from keeping

27
00:02:14.20 --> 00:02:20.000
diaries taking photos, making drawings or tape recordings, notes of any sort.

28
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.96
The sergeant major advised us that anyone who didn't want to sign that agreement could

29
00:02:23.96 --> 00:02:26.44
leave.

30
00:02:26.44 --> 00:02:31.88
Gentlemen, the sergeant major turned toward a generic map on the wall. The North Vietnamese

31
00:02:31.88 --> 00:02:35.08
Army controls these neutral countries.

32
00:02:35.08 --> 00:02:39.92
And pointed to Cambodia and Louss, located to the west of the Republic of South Vietnam,

33
00:02:39.92 --> 00:02:45.56
and of course, North Vietnam. For several years, the North Vietnamese Army had moved soldiers,

34
00:02:45.56 --> 00:02:51.40
supplies, rockets, guns, and propaganda south into the eastern provinces of neutral,

35
00:02:51.40 --> 00:02:57.88
Louss and Cambodia, through an ever-increasing network of trails and roads called the Ho Chi

36
00:02:57.88 --> 00:03:02.08
Men Trail Complex.

37
00:03:02.08 --> 00:03:07.48
Now listen up real close, the sergeant major said, when you go across the fence, you

38
00:03:07.48 --> 00:03:12.04
will carry no identification of any manner, shape, or form.

39
00:03:12.04 --> 00:03:17.72
That meant no identification papers, no dog tags, no diaries, no photos, no love letters,

40
00:03:17.72 --> 00:03:20.92
and certainly no green berets.

41
00:03:20.92 --> 00:03:26.80
Everyone would wear sterile fatigues with no company insignia, no name tags, no unit designators,

42
00:03:26.80 --> 00:03:32.16
no jump wings, or combat infantrymen badges.

43
00:03:32.16 --> 00:03:37.32
Why? Without giving anyone a chance to respond, he said that because Louss and Cambodia

44
00:03:37.32 --> 00:03:43.36
were neutral, United States government could publicly proclaim that the US repres respected

45
00:03:43.36 --> 00:03:49.92
that neutrality. Thus, if we were killed in Louss, Cambodia or North Vietnam, the US government

46
00:03:49.92 --> 00:03:53.68
would deny having anything to do with us.

47
00:03:53.68 --> 00:03:58.72
United States government would explain that no Americans were stationed in Louss or Cambodia,

48
00:03:58.72 --> 00:04:01.88
which was technically accurate.

49
00:04:01.88 --> 00:04:08.20
The US government had a plausible deniability if we were killed or captured.

50
00:04:08.20 --> 00:04:12.36
And if captured, we were to speak of foreign language.

51
00:04:12.36 --> 00:04:15.80
Don't tell them who you are, he ordered.

52
00:04:15.80 --> 00:04:19.96
Remember, technically, under the terms and conditions of the Geneva Accords, your status

53
00:04:19.96 --> 00:04:25.68
is different than Air Force and Navy pilots shot down over North Vietnam, they're in uniform.

54
00:04:25.68 --> 00:04:28.80
Their identify as US servicemen.

55
00:04:28.80 --> 00:04:34.56
CNC men don't fall into the category of prisoners of war.

56
00:04:34.56 --> 00:04:41.92
We were, in effect, spies, although the sergeant major never used that word.

57
00:04:41.92 --> 00:04:47.08
He also didn't tell us that spies had no protection under the Geneva Convention and that

58
00:04:47.08 --> 00:04:55.08
we could some are rarely be executed if captured.

59
00:04:55.08 --> 00:05:01.68
And that right there, that's some excerpts from the beginning of a book called Across the

60
00:05:01.68 --> 00:05:09.24
Fence, which is written by a special forces soldier in Vietnam named John Stryker

61
00:05:09.24 --> 00:05:12.92
Meyer.

62
00:05:12.92 --> 00:05:20.28
And in this particular case, it is an absolute honor for me to say that we have him here

63
00:05:20.28 --> 00:05:27.12
with us tonight to teach us about his experiences as a member of Mac Vesog, studies and

64
00:05:27.12 --> 00:05:33.72
observations, command group, command and control teams.

65
00:05:33.72 --> 00:05:34.72
Sir?

66
00:05:34.72 --> 00:05:35.72
Welcome.

67
00:05:35.72 --> 00:05:37.72
Welcome to the show.

68
00:05:37.72 --> 00:05:39.72
Glad to be here.

69
00:05:39.72 --> 00:05:40.72
That's quite a welcome.

70
00:05:40.72 --> 00:05:41.72
You got the Vietnam, huh?

71
00:05:41.72 --> 00:05:44.60
Yes, it was quite something, absolutely.

72
00:05:44.60 --> 00:05:49.40
And at the time we just watched the John Wayne movie to Green Barais on top of it all.

73
00:05:49.40 --> 00:05:51.40
So we were all psyched.

74
00:05:51.40 --> 00:05:53.28
We're seeing the movie we're ready.

75
00:05:53.28 --> 00:05:54.64
That's all it takes.

76
00:05:54.64 --> 00:05:57.28
And we have been for warned, you know, when you go there, this is going to happen.

77
00:05:57.28 --> 00:05:59.76
Little guy is going to come out and ask for people to volunteer.

78
00:05:59.76 --> 00:06:01.12
So we said, yeah, right.

79
00:06:01.12 --> 00:06:05.08
Now, when we were done, it happened before the shift to say our little guy goes out,

80
00:06:05.08 --> 00:06:07.24
we're looking for volunteers.

81
00:06:07.24 --> 00:06:12.08
And then Johnny Mac goes, for what sergeant can't tell you either you're in or you're

82
00:06:12.08 --> 00:06:13.08
not.

83
00:06:13.08 --> 00:06:14.08
So we raised her hands.

84
00:06:14.08 --> 00:06:16.88
Next day we're up in denying for that briefing you covered.

85
00:06:16.88 --> 00:06:20.92
Yeah, how do you end up in a military?

86
00:06:20.92 --> 00:06:21.92
Where'd you grow up?

87
00:06:21.92 --> 00:06:22.92
You grew up in Jersey?

88
00:06:22.92 --> 00:06:25.16
Yeah, grew up in Trenton, New Jersey.

89
00:06:25.16 --> 00:06:27.52
Dad was a milk man, grew up in the milk truck.

90
00:06:27.52 --> 00:06:31.36
And my mom was a piano teacher, choir organist.

91
00:06:31.36 --> 00:06:38.28
And after high school, it took me two years to flunk out a college.

92
00:06:38.28 --> 00:06:43.000
Upon flunking out in 1966, I was working up here 70 in National Park.

93
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Oh, nice.

94
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.48
Yeah, the garbage man firing man up there.

95
00:06:46.48 --> 00:06:49.24
And the book, the green brace came out.

96
00:06:49.24 --> 00:06:51.44
And my dad is sent me a letter saying, hey, that's it.

97
00:06:51.44 --> 00:06:53.04
You've finally flunked out.

98
00:06:53.04 --> 00:06:54.24
You're going to get drafted.

99
00:06:54.24 --> 00:06:56.44
We got the notification here from the draft board.

100
00:06:56.44 --> 00:06:59.92
So I read the book and I said, you know what, if I'm going to go, if I can get in with

101
00:06:59.92 --> 00:07:02.44
these guys, that'd be a great challenge.

102
00:07:02.44 --> 00:07:05.28
And if I can do that, that's the way I want to go.

103
00:07:05.28 --> 00:07:10.68
Because at that time, with the army, eight weeks of basic training, eight weeks of advanced

104
00:07:10.68 --> 00:07:12.60
infantry, a month leaving, you're in Vietnam.

105
00:07:12.60 --> 00:07:16.000
You could be with any regular conventional unit.

106
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.84
But at that time, there had been a story about some issues, particularly when the

107
00:07:20.84 --> 00:07:25.48
were engaged in the regular North Vietnamese army, that there were have some major issues,

108
00:07:25.48 --> 00:07:27.92
and surprises to how strong the enemy was.

109
00:07:27.92 --> 00:07:30.28
So give me some more training.

110
00:07:30.28 --> 00:07:31.28
I needed it.

111
00:07:31.28 --> 00:07:35.60
And when you were a kid, did you play sports or anything like that?

112
00:07:35.60 --> 00:07:38.64
Yeah, I was never that good at it.

113
00:07:38.64 --> 00:07:42.56
But I loved baseball, was a head game, and football.

114
00:07:42.56 --> 00:07:46.76
And my dad wouldn't let me play football to my senior year of high school.

115
00:07:46.76 --> 00:07:50.12
So I had one year of football, but everything else was just like J.V.

116
00:07:50.12 --> 00:07:52.12
Little League, just love baseball.

117
00:07:52.12 --> 00:07:53.12
Where do you want your play football?

118
00:07:53.12 --> 00:07:55.12
Do you want you to hit in the head too much?

119
00:07:55.12 --> 00:07:58.12
They didn't care about that.

120
00:07:58.12 --> 00:07:59.12
Did they?

121
00:07:59.12 --> 00:08:03.60
You know what, I think it was more, well, in eighth grade, I heard my knee playing soccer.

122
00:08:03.60 --> 00:08:07.92
I said it were worried about follow up injuries here, and still have your body in one piece

123
00:08:07.92 --> 00:08:11.32
when you go to college or wherever you're going to go.

124
00:08:11.32 --> 00:08:13.32
So they were very conservative.

125
00:08:13.32 --> 00:08:20.92
I mean, my mom, she's no foreign girl from Central Jersey, and she was really unhappy

126
00:08:20.92 --> 00:08:23.64
when my granddad gave me a cap pistol.

127
00:08:23.64 --> 00:08:26.32
So that's the household we grew up in.

128
00:08:26.32 --> 00:08:31.16
But you know, eventually we went out, learned about weapons a little bit along the way,

129
00:08:31.16 --> 00:08:34.80
and then of course when this came along, do we got to real deal?

130
00:08:34.80 --> 00:08:41.08
And so in 1966, so public opinion wasn't completely against the war yet.

131
00:08:41.08 --> 00:08:42.08
It was in 1966?

132
00:08:42.08 --> 00:08:43.56
No, but it was beginning.

133
00:08:43.56 --> 00:08:44.56
It was starting.

134
00:08:44.56 --> 00:08:45.56
It was starting.

135
00:08:45.56 --> 00:08:51.32
You had people doing their protest and letters to Yatter, and some of the fringe elements

136
00:08:51.32 --> 00:08:53.56
have society like we see today.

137
00:08:53.56 --> 00:08:55.76
Some of those parallels.

138
00:08:55.76 --> 00:09:00.92
But you going down, how did your parents, your dad was on board, obviously, because he

139
00:09:00.92 --> 00:09:02.88
sent you the letter saying, all right, buddy.

140
00:09:02.88 --> 00:09:04.72
Yeah, what's the school that you think?

141
00:09:04.72 --> 00:09:05.72
What school did you think out of?

142
00:09:05.72 --> 00:09:07.12
Yeah, try and stay college.

143
00:09:07.12 --> 00:09:08.12
Yeah.

144
00:09:08.12 --> 00:09:11.32
How are you just said, I'm going to go to your ceremony to be a firefighter?

145
00:09:11.32 --> 00:09:15.16
Well, we had a couple of buddies of mine that I've been in college with helped me flunk

146
00:09:15.16 --> 00:09:17.16
out.

147
00:09:17.16 --> 00:09:22.12
And we did much, much serious drinking just stupid young, young, young, dumb.

148
00:09:22.12 --> 00:09:24.12
And the idea what you're talking about.

149
00:09:24.12 --> 00:09:28.64
Yeah, I'm sure.

150
00:09:28.64 --> 00:09:33.24
So they had a crop congressman that got us jobs in your semides.

151
00:09:33.24 --> 00:09:40.40
It's a good old Frank Thompson came through for us. He drove across and in fact, in Manhattan

152
00:09:40.40 --> 00:09:44.44
Kansas, we got hit with tornado, June 12th going across the Rocky Mountains.

153
00:09:44.44 --> 00:09:47.04
We had snow with a back window blowing out of the car.

154
00:09:47.04 --> 00:09:48.04
So it was just fun.

155
00:09:48.04 --> 00:09:49.04
Yeah.

156
00:09:49.04 --> 00:09:52.16
In a nice experience, again, we drank a little bit too much there.

157
00:09:52.16 --> 00:09:56.52
But the first time we were able to job real money and then the reality check, it was just

158
00:09:56.52 --> 00:09:59.16
like these guys are amazing.

159
00:09:59.16 --> 00:10:03.24
I mean, if I could get even close to this to get the jump school, at least get a taste of this.

160
00:10:03.24 --> 00:10:04.60
So that was the plan.

161
00:10:04.60 --> 00:10:09.24
How was the culture shock when you rolled into Army boot camp?

162
00:10:09.24 --> 00:10:13.76
Well, but at the time, I've seen a couple dozen of the movies over time from the World

163
00:10:13.76 --> 00:10:14.76
World War II movies.

164
00:10:14.76 --> 00:10:16.56
It kind of knew what was coming.

165
00:10:16.56 --> 00:10:24.48
So early on, I had a friend of mine who's dad had been in New York.

166
00:10:24.48 --> 00:10:26.76
He goes, you go in.

167
00:10:26.76 --> 00:10:28.48
Just remember, this is like a game.

168
00:10:28.48 --> 00:10:32.16
They want to see if they can break your knot and you just got to have the right mindset.

169
00:10:32.16 --> 00:10:33.56
That stuck with me.

170
00:10:33.56 --> 00:10:37.000
So through basic, particularly with jump school, they come in and shake you out of bed

171
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.68
to a clock in the morning for bogus inspections.

172
00:10:39.68 --> 00:10:43.28
Just to see if they could mess you up or break you a little bit.

173
00:10:43.28 --> 00:10:45.52
Kind of like, okay, we all noticed this is a game.

174
00:10:45.52 --> 00:10:47.60
We all know we're training here.

175
00:10:47.60 --> 00:10:49.56
And so that was the way we moved forward.

176
00:10:49.56 --> 00:10:53.08
And you guys could go right into the, you guys, you could go right into the QCourse.

177
00:10:53.08 --> 00:10:54.60
Like you could just do that pipeline.

178
00:10:54.60 --> 00:10:55.60
It was open for you.

179
00:10:55.60 --> 00:10:59.84
Well, because we lost so many people, they came out at that time, we called the baby

180
00:10:59.84 --> 00:11:01.52
SF course.

181
00:11:01.52 --> 00:11:03.44
So yes.

182
00:11:03.44 --> 00:11:07.08
And even to this day, some of the guys that went through training group with are still

183
00:11:07.08 --> 00:11:10.28
down a brag now training SF guys.

184
00:11:10.28 --> 00:11:12.88
And we're biased.

185
00:11:12.88 --> 00:11:19.32
But we feel that if you come through basic advanced jump school and go right into the QCourse

186
00:11:19.32 --> 00:11:24.08
and qualify, now I have a pre-qualification, then your qualification, and then you get

187
00:11:24.08 --> 00:11:25.08
the bere.

188
00:11:25.08 --> 00:11:29.20
That there's no bad habits.

189
00:11:29.20 --> 00:11:34.12
Like a lot of the sergeants for the old days when they came in, you had to be an E5 above

190
00:11:34.12 --> 00:11:37.80
more time and grade, et cetera, et cetera.

191
00:11:37.80 --> 00:11:42.48
And before they be even considerate, but they need a bodies.

192
00:11:42.48 --> 00:11:45.24
Well, the guys, again, were biased.

193
00:11:45.24 --> 00:11:47.24
So let me get the bias out front.

194
00:11:47.24 --> 00:11:51.44
As the green kids that came in, that went off the day to job.

195
00:11:51.44 --> 00:11:58.16
And eventually it saw, by 68 and 69, the majority of the ones, zeros, team leaders were

196
00:11:58.16 --> 00:11:59.80
young guys.

197
00:11:59.80 --> 00:12:05.36
And there's a lot of us that either got bored, like a miccase, flunked out, or just wanted

198
00:12:05.36 --> 00:12:07.76
some different, something different.

199
00:12:07.76 --> 00:12:09.20
And it said, this is special forces.

200
00:12:09.20 --> 00:12:10.92
And then you get the rumors.

201
00:12:10.92 --> 00:12:14.92
And then you finally get to that briefing where you say, here's a chance to volunteer.

202
00:12:14.92 --> 00:12:15.92
It's a little de-realized.

203
00:12:15.92 --> 00:12:18.80
There's the highest casualty operation in the entire world.

204
00:12:18.80 --> 00:12:19.80
But they forgot to tell you.

205
00:12:19.80 --> 00:12:22.48
They didn't tell you that part.

206
00:12:22.48 --> 00:12:25.76
So did you volunteer for CNC while you were still state-sided?

207
00:12:25.76 --> 00:12:27.28
Was that once you got overseas?

208
00:12:27.28 --> 00:12:31.88
No, at that time, the only way you could get it in the special forces, or that program was

209
00:12:31.88 --> 00:12:35.76
to list for airborne on a signed.

210
00:12:35.76 --> 00:12:42.12
And then when you went through basic, then the vancimitriot, you would be offered the

211
00:12:42.12 --> 00:12:44.000
opportunity to volunteer.

212
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.48
So during one of the classes, they would have, you know, like, in my case, it was a rainy

213
00:12:49.48 --> 00:12:53.64
day where in the gym, there's like 607 of people sitting on the floor.

214
00:12:53.64 --> 00:12:56.52
And they had a stage of front-wood side steps.

215
00:12:56.52 --> 00:13:00.40
And a cook would come up and say, hey, the coolest MOS, you'll never go hung you with

216
00:13:00.40 --> 00:13:01.40
us.

217
00:13:01.40 --> 00:13:04.48
And they're all fat and sloppy, you know, just a couple of times.

218
00:13:04.48 --> 00:13:09.32
And then other guys coming for commo, Intel, MPs, that kind of stuff.

219
00:13:09.32 --> 00:13:12.12
At the very end, this little banty rooster comes in.

220
00:13:12.12 --> 00:13:13.12
It was raining.

221
00:13:13.12 --> 00:13:15.40
So everybody else had to rain jackets and stuff on.

222
00:13:15.40 --> 00:13:20.56
This banty rooster comes in with a buray and his fatigues are wet.

223
00:13:20.56 --> 00:13:26.28
He came up and did a straight jump on the stage, turned around and said, we're looking

224
00:13:26.28 --> 00:13:28.72
for a recruits for special forces.

225
00:13:28.72 --> 00:13:31.72
If you're interested in seeing me outside, in fact, anybody interested?

226
00:13:31.72 --> 00:13:33.40
Well, hell, I read the book.

227
00:13:33.40 --> 00:13:35.16
I jumped up off the floor.

228
00:13:35.16 --> 00:13:36.76
Me about three other guys.

229
00:13:36.76 --> 00:13:38.16
And the other seven hundred just sat there.

230
00:13:38.16 --> 00:13:40.96
I'm going to like, WTF.

231
00:13:40.96 --> 00:13:42.60
You guys are going to nom the couple weeks.

232
00:13:42.60 --> 00:13:46.000
I'm going to get this a little bit more trained there.

233
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.16
It was just amazing.

234
00:13:47.16 --> 00:13:48.64
So he jumped off the stage.

235
00:13:48.64 --> 00:13:49.64
Now it's it.

236
00:13:49.64 --> 00:13:50.88
So he ran us through the cycle of a test.

237
00:13:50.88 --> 00:13:54.32
Had to show we could swim, run, all that stuff.

238
00:13:54.32 --> 00:13:57.16
And then when you were comm guy initially, did you get trained as a comm guy?

239
00:13:57.16 --> 00:13:58.16
Yes.

240
00:13:58.16 --> 00:13:59.80
Is it, was it, was it, was it still called 18 echo back then?

241
00:13:59.80 --> 00:14:01.80
No, no, this is prehistoric guy.

242
00:14:01.80 --> 00:14:03.12
Go 5B for us.

243
00:14:03.12 --> 00:14:05.84
The 4S is the SF designator.

244
00:14:05.84 --> 00:14:09.40
God, and O5B is commomores code.

245
00:14:09.40 --> 00:14:12.56
And then after a training group, they sent us down for 12.

246
00:14:12.56 --> 00:14:15.40
Weeks to 4Gordon for RTT.

247
00:14:15.40 --> 00:14:17.84
Because they need a lot of A camps.

248
00:14:17.84 --> 00:14:20.48
And of course, C and C needed some RTT operators.

249
00:14:20.48 --> 00:14:21.48
Radio tell it.

250
00:14:21.48 --> 00:14:24.16
And so that was the extra training.

251
00:14:24.16 --> 00:14:25.68
And that's where I got busted.

252
00:14:25.68 --> 00:14:28.88
Me and Johnny McIntyre got busted down to private.

253
00:14:28.88 --> 00:14:30.16
He do so.

254
00:14:30.16 --> 00:14:31.16
We landed and not.

255
00:14:31.16 --> 00:14:33.28
Where did you reach the new to our nine?

256
00:14:33.28 --> 00:14:35.12
Well, we were just asked holes really.

257
00:14:35.12 --> 00:14:37.36
I mean, these are, these are butter bars.

258
00:14:37.36 --> 00:14:39.32
Two young Nutenists that get this company.

259
00:14:39.32 --> 00:14:40.56
And here come these green berets.

260
00:14:40.56 --> 00:14:42.52
We just got done all our training.

261
00:14:42.52 --> 00:14:43.52
We're official green berets.

262
00:14:43.52 --> 00:14:45.72
You're the baddest man on the planet.

263
00:14:45.72 --> 00:14:47.52
That's over your body.

264
00:14:47.52 --> 00:14:49.000
Yeah.

265
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.76
So when I have my article 15 hearing with the CO, I go in.

266
00:14:52.76 --> 00:14:54.72
And there's eight article 15s on the tail.

267
00:14:54.72 --> 00:14:55.72
It says pick one.

268
00:14:55.72 --> 00:14:57.92
If I picked one, scrusted up and threw it at me.

269
00:14:57.92 --> 00:14:59.92
Because you got nine now.

270
00:14:59.92 --> 00:15:02.56
And I got me a Macatar got busted.

271
00:15:02.56 --> 00:15:05.28
So is he do's landed in knobs and he do's.

272
00:15:05.28 --> 00:15:06.28
Oh, yeah.

273
00:15:06.28 --> 00:15:07.28
Yeah.

274
00:15:07.28 --> 00:15:11.48
So you get to, so it wasn't until you got to Vietnam.

275
00:15:11.48 --> 00:15:12.48
Correct.

276
00:15:12.48 --> 00:15:13.48
What about CNC?

277
00:15:13.48 --> 00:15:14.72
Or no, you said some training instructors.

278
00:15:14.72 --> 00:15:15.72
Right.

279
00:15:15.72 --> 00:15:16.92
And he told you like they don't do a comma.

280
00:15:16.92 --> 00:15:19.28
Well, you know, here, one of these little side bars.

281
00:15:19.28 --> 00:15:23.92
And we go through comma myself, Macatar and few us got recycled.

282
00:15:23.92 --> 00:15:28.28
Because you had to get up to, I figured, 12 or 15 groups were limited or something.

283
00:15:28.28 --> 00:15:29.40
For a minute, yeah.

284
00:15:29.40 --> 00:15:30.40
WPMs.

285
00:15:30.40 --> 00:15:31.40
Yeah.

286
00:15:31.40 --> 00:15:32.40
And two at the.

287
00:15:32.40 --> 00:15:33.40
Is that right?

288
00:15:33.40 --> 00:15:34.40
I went through a course.

289
00:15:34.40 --> 00:15:37.28
Like when the last guys that were learning Morris code and we had to get whatever

290
00:15:37.28 --> 00:15:38.28
it was.

291
00:15:38.28 --> 00:15:39.68
I think we had a lower standard than that.

292
00:15:39.68 --> 00:15:42.68
Because we, because it was just no one would have bought it.

293
00:15:42.68 --> 00:15:43.68
You want to even officers, then.

294
00:15:43.68 --> 00:15:48.24
You couldn't give you the officer out of the room.

295
00:15:48.24 --> 00:15:52.96
So no, but one of our guys who took us under his wing was a guy named Paul Villarosa,

296
00:15:52.96 --> 00:15:56.96
SFC, been in non-three times, had a little tattoo around his neck.

297
00:15:56.96 --> 00:15:58.76
Cut here.

298
00:15:58.76 --> 00:16:00.12
And but he helped us.

299
00:16:00.12 --> 00:16:01.32
He got us gone.

300
00:16:01.32 --> 00:16:05.88
So in our mind, he and we had a widener in Russo, two other instructors for the

301
00:16:05.88 --> 00:16:07.52
O5B.

302
00:16:07.52 --> 00:16:09.72
And so one thing got to know is near the end.

303
00:16:09.72 --> 00:16:12.60
It's like, hey, you guys go, don't do this.

304
00:16:12.60 --> 00:16:13.60
Followed, cheers stuff.

305
00:16:13.60 --> 00:16:14.60
Get an A camp.

306
00:16:14.60 --> 00:16:15.60
Turned about the people.

307
00:16:15.60 --> 00:16:16.60
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

308
00:16:16.60 --> 00:16:17.60
Okay.

309
00:16:17.60 --> 00:16:18.60
That's what it came down to.

310
00:16:18.60 --> 00:16:22.24
So when we get that briefing, the top secret briefing and one of the first things we hear about

311
00:16:22.24 --> 00:16:25.84
from Scuddlebut, Paul Villarosa was KIA.

312
00:16:25.84 --> 00:16:32.56
The first KIA out of FB4 at the time, which was in January of 68.

313
00:16:32.56 --> 00:16:37.48
So here's one of our living legends who got us in the SFC, trained us up.

314
00:16:37.48 --> 00:16:38.48
It's KIA.

315
00:16:38.48 --> 00:16:41.80
And that had us, you know, talked about science.

316
00:16:41.80 --> 00:16:43.20
It hit hard.

317
00:16:43.20 --> 00:16:48.36
But so that was in Vietnam when they now said to you, okay, do you want to be a part

318
00:16:48.36 --> 00:16:49.36
of this other program?

319
00:16:49.36 --> 00:16:50.36
Right.

320
00:16:50.36 --> 00:16:53.64
Do you want to go one more volunteer route and then up here?

321
00:16:53.64 --> 00:16:55.76
Yes, of course you're like, yeah, let's bring it.

322
00:16:55.76 --> 00:16:56.76
Let's go.

323
00:16:56.76 --> 00:16:58.76
Young and dumb.

324
00:16:58.76 --> 00:17:04.16
And then so then you immediately got us signed.

325
00:17:04.16 --> 00:17:05.16
Right.

326
00:17:05.16 --> 00:17:09.80
Let's do screen, you anything else, they just said, okay, you're smart enough to volunteer.

327
00:17:09.80 --> 00:17:11.44
Yeah, that's what you were talking about.

328
00:17:11.44 --> 00:17:12.76
All the vetting had been done.

329
00:17:12.76 --> 00:17:17.52
And all of us either had the top secret or it was in process.

330
00:17:17.52 --> 00:17:25.12
And so from near, literally, next day, a plane to Denang up north and then we had the briefing.

331
00:17:25.12 --> 00:17:29.52
And of course, you know, we had a safe house at Denang where there's House 22, that's

332
00:17:29.52 --> 00:17:31.16
our safe house.

333
00:17:31.16 --> 00:17:33.80
And walking to special forces.

334
00:17:33.80 --> 00:17:40.16
And that was the safe house that was run by either us or the agency or both.

335
00:17:40.16 --> 00:17:44.76
And you know, you go in and here's old SF guys.

336
00:17:44.76 --> 00:17:49.40
In fact, there was one of the teams that just got back from trying to arrest you one of

337
00:17:49.40 --> 00:17:50.40
our hatchet forces.

338
00:17:50.40 --> 00:17:54.52
And there was a sit and they're talking about the combat and Mac and I said, we're going,

339
00:17:54.52 --> 00:17:56.68
oh, shit, we're going to really die.

340
00:17:56.68 --> 00:17:58.72
It's a good thing we spent our money.

341
00:17:58.72 --> 00:18:04.000
We were going through the RTA training.

342
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.28
We had a weekend pass.

343
00:18:05.28 --> 00:18:09.68
We go up in Washington when we see the Tata offensive and the tanks are running over Lang

344
00:18:09.68 --> 00:18:13.40
Bay, the A camp at Lang Bay, A 101.

345
00:18:13.40 --> 00:18:15.40
We know we're going to die.

346
00:18:15.40 --> 00:18:16.40
We're high degree of certainty.

347
00:18:16.40 --> 00:18:19.24
So we went home, took our money out of the bank.

348
00:18:19.24 --> 00:18:24.28
All of our princely earnings of $1,000 to a state dinner until you went to Vietnam.

349
00:18:24.28 --> 00:18:29.24
So there we were at this house 22 and we're thinking about the same thing as going, oh, shit,

350
00:18:29.24 --> 00:18:31.12
we're really into it now.

351
00:18:31.12 --> 00:18:34.36
And so we go upstairs, take showers and then the showers, the couple of these hookers that

352
00:18:34.36 --> 00:18:38.52
are in there, do you know, with Coke, Coca-Cola.

353
00:18:38.52 --> 00:18:39.52
Yeah.

354
00:18:39.52 --> 00:18:42.48
And they're clean up just like welcoming you here a couple of guys getting a load in the

355
00:18:42.48 --> 00:18:44.20
back there and they're all pumping away.

356
00:18:44.20 --> 00:18:46.32
It's like, oh, this is really cool.

357
00:18:46.32 --> 00:18:50.04
They're just about this side of Vietnam.

358
00:18:50.04 --> 00:18:51.04
Here we go.

359
00:18:51.04 --> 00:18:52.04
Yeah.

360
00:18:52.04 --> 00:18:53.04
So bring it on.

361
00:18:53.04 --> 00:18:54.04
We're ready.

362
00:18:54.04 --> 00:19:00.76
And then you talk about that flight up to the first place you got to sign was Fab 1.

363
00:19:00.76 --> 00:19:01.76
Yeah.

364
00:19:01.76 --> 00:19:03.76
So we always call it an F.O.B.

365
00:19:03.76 --> 00:19:06.12
You guys call it Fab and you get a generation.

366
00:19:06.12 --> 00:19:07.96
I guess we're cutting corners over here.

367
00:19:07.96 --> 00:19:08.96
Okay.

368
00:19:08.96 --> 00:19:10.76
So you're going to F.O.B.1.

369
00:19:10.76 --> 00:19:12.96
Call anything like still giving you late for supper.

370
00:19:12.96 --> 00:19:17.72
Well, there's a whole, there's a whole offshoot of the word F.O.B.

371
00:19:17.72 --> 00:19:19.20
Which we turned into Fab.

372
00:19:19.20 --> 00:19:21.28
Have you ever heard the turn Fab it before?

373
00:19:21.28 --> 00:19:22.28
Yes.

374
00:19:22.28 --> 00:19:24.28
So someone that stays on the fob and never goes out.

375
00:19:24.28 --> 00:19:25.28
Yeah.

376
00:19:25.28 --> 00:19:28.28
So known as REMS.

377
00:19:28.28 --> 00:19:29.28
Yeah.

378
00:19:29.28 --> 00:19:34.72
Well, yes, the REMS is what you guys call them and I don't know if the name of my consultant

379
00:19:34.72 --> 00:19:36.72
company is actually on front.

380
00:19:36.72 --> 00:19:40.44
And the reason we called the company actually on front is because we wanted people know

381
00:19:40.44 --> 00:19:44.68
that we were the guys that were like in the front, not the REMS.

382
00:19:44.68 --> 00:19:47.16
Which is specifically taken from David Hack where it's book.

383
00:19:47.16 --> 00:19:48.16
Indeed.

384
00:19:48.16 --> 00:19:49.76
Runa-tun, read it ton of times.

385
00:19:49.76 --> 00:19:50.76
Yeah.

386
00:19:50.76 --> 00:19:51.76
Me too.

387
00:19:51.76 --> 00:19:52.76
Yeah.

388
00:19:52.76 --> 00:19:53.76
Awesome.

389
00:19:53.76 --> 00:19:56.76
And flying up into F.O.B.1.

390
00:19:56.76 --> 00:19:57.76
Right with the Kingby.

391
00:19:57.76 --> 00:19:58.76
Yeah.

392
00:19:58.76 --> 00:19:59.76
How was that?

393
00:19:59.76 --> 00:20:00.76
Oh, God.

394
00:20:00.76 --> 00:20:06.64
It was just another day of the secret war, you know, because they had the old H.34s.

395
00:20:06.64 --> 00:20:11.96
And so the pilots stood up high and then you had the the apartment in the back for the passengers.

396
00:20:11.96 --> 00:20:13.68
And there's a door gunner.

397
00:20:13.68 --> 00:20:20.52
So when McIntyre and me and John Hutchins get on the H.34s, the door is only on the right

398
00:20:20.52 --> 00:20:21.52
side.

399
00:20:21.52 --> 00:20:27.000
So we all get in and I see the helicopter pilot gunner gunner gunner gunner gunner gunner.

400
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Was the gunner Vietnamese?

401
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Yeah.

402
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
This is all Vietnamese.

403
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.32
Were you ready for that mentally?

404
00:20:32.32 --> 00:20:33.32
Not at all.

405
00:20:33.32 --> 00:20:34.32
Okay.

406
00:20:34.32 --> 00:20:35.32
I guess like yeah.

407
00:20:35.32 --> 00:20:36.32
Because it's one more novelty.

408
00:20:36.32 --> 00:20:41.58
Important note to make everyone so the aircraft is being flown by a Vietnamese pilot with

409
00:20:41.58 --> 00:20:43.84
a Vietnamese copilot and a Vietnamese gunner.

410
00:20:43.84 --> 00:20:44.84
Yeah.

411
00:20:44.84 --> 00:20:50.04
It was the 2019 Special Operations Squadron for the South Vietnamese Air Force.

412
00:20:50.04 --> 00:20:51.80
And all pilots.

413
00:20:51.80 --> 00:20:58.12
And so, you know, our training was we're going to work with the people there at the

414
00:20:58.12 --> 00:20:59.84
end of business people.

415
00:20:59.84 --> 00:21:05.68
But when you literally climb it to their helicopter and your life is now in their hands.

416
00:21:05.68 --> 00:21:08.04
That's like, you know, we did a big semester.

417
00:21:08.04 --> 00:21:09.36
I didn't really think about it.

418
00:21:09.36 --> 00:21:15.48
But it was taking those couple steps, jumping in and going like, WTF2, what's going on here

419
00:21:15.48 --> 00:21:16.48
now?

420
00:21:16.48 --> 00:21:19.76
I thought we have, you know, like, you like we've seen in the movie with John.

421
00:21:19.76 --> 00:21:20.76
They all had you.

422
00:21:20.76 --> 00:21:22.20
It's not this old age 34.

423
00:21:22.20 --> 00:21:23.20
Of course, keep thing.

424
00:21:23.20 --> 00:21:27.92
And that has it in the engine and that was a B-17 rotary engine.

425
00:21:27.92 --> 00:21:33.000
And we're going to get into the fact of how those guys prove themselves over and over

426
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.88
over again to be just incredibly brave and not just incredibly good pilots.

427
00:21:38.88 --> 00:21:41.60
But just brave beyond comprehension.

428
00:21:41.60 --> 00:21:45.48
Would you find up there was it was it a mellow flight up there?

429
00:21:45.48 --> 00:21:46.48
It was cool.

430
00:21:46.48 --> 00:21:47.48
Yeah, it was a beautiful day.

431
00:21:47.48 --> 00:21:52.04
You know, it's warm like it.

432
00:21:52.04 --> 00:21:53.04
It's always hot.

433
00:21:53.04 --> 00:21:52.76
But once you get there, you get to flow you to how it is when you're flying through.

434
00:21:52.76 --> 00:21:54.52
And we go on over to Cemetery, isn't everything.

435
00:21:54.52 --> 00:22:00.80
And we're going down Highway 1, which is heading north from Danang up to Fubai.

436
00:22:00.80 --> 00:22:03.08
And we went past the Fubai airport.

437
00:22:03.08 --> 00:22:06.84
And so we're flying north on the west side of the Highway 1.

438
00:22:06.84 --> 00:22:11.60
And you see the airport and then this is big compound, which was the second Armin Division

439
00:22:11.60 --> 00:22:13.72
training camp company.

440
00:22:13.72 --> 00:22:19.44
And then all of a sudden it's like your flying north and then on your side, looking straight

441
00:22:19.44 --> 00:22:24.28
down at the rear, you did a 90 degree flip as it begins to turn.

442
00:22:24.28 --> 00:22:28.92
So I've seen the guy talking, the door gun are like doing a scrunchy thing.

443
00:22:28.92 --> 00:22:33.32
You know, we all had our new faties and you could just tell where newbies, disgusting

444
00:22:33.32 --> 00:22:35.000
newbies, green ass green gray.

445
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.08
I mean, this guy's going to have his kick.

446
00:22:37.08 --> 00:22:38.48
So I was kind of thinking, what's up?

447
00:22:38.48 --> 00:22:39.48
It's going to happen.

448
00:22:39.48 --> 00:22:40.48
What is this?

449
00:22:40.48 --> 00:22:42.48
Well, Mac and Target was cheap.

450
00:22:42.48 --> 00:22:45.24
And Hutchins goes the same way.

451
00:22:45.24 --> 00:22:48.60
And I'll watch the guy.

452
00:22:48.60 --> 00:22:50.40
So we did the, you know, you looked down.

453
00:22:50.40 --> 00:22:51.72
There's the road.

454
00:22:51.72 --> 00:22:55.80
And it's the first time we had a helicopter with that kind of a radical ride.

455
00:22:55.80 --> 00:22:57.56
And so he did a 180.

456
00:22:57.56 --> 00:23:00.08
And then came back and did a 360 and landed.

457
00:23:00.08 --> 00:23:01.08
We get off.

458
00:23:01.08 --> 00:23:04.48
Well, we get off and then a reconteen gets on.

459
00:23:04.48 --> 00:23:06.48
Disappears.

460
00:23:06.48 --> 00:23:08.48
Was that was that spite team?

461
00:23:08.48 --> 00:23:09.48
I'd hope that got on.

462
00:23:09.48 --> 00:23:10.48
Correct.

463
00:23:10.48 --> 00:23:14.72
So that happens the one zero as to bracelet right there.

464
00:23:14.72 --> 00:23:18.76
And that does that you got off that bird that brought you into F.O.B.1.

465
00:23:18.76 --> 00:23:22.40
And it was spite team Idaho that got on board.

466
00:23:22.40 --> 00:23:23.40
Yep.

467
00:23:23.40 --> 00:23:27.56
Then it was the one zero and Robert O'Nn was the one one with four

468
00:23:27.56 --> 00:23:30.08
and distance troops for five and distance troops.

469
00:23:30.08 --> 00:23:33.36
And so you start your check in and whatever.

470
00:23:33.36 --> 00:23:34.36
And then whatever.

471
00:23:34.36 --> 00:23:35.88
How many hours goes by?

472
00:23:35.88 --> 00:23:36.88
Yeah.

473
00:23:36.88 --> 00:23:39.08
And all of a sudden, what's happening on camp when you start to realize

474
00:23:39.08 --> 00:23:40.24
that something's going sideways?

475
00:23:40.24 --> 00:23:42.88
Well, you know, it's very fortunate when we'll be training group.

476
00:23:42.88 --> 00:23:47.32
I was a catcher and played center field for eight company softball team.

477
00:23:47.32 --> 00:23:48.96
And we went on to feed it that summer.

478
00:23:48.96 --> 00:23:50.52
And the reason why is spite or parks?

479
00:23:50.52 --> 00:23:53.68
Robert J. Spite or parks was our pitcher.

480
00:23:53.68 --> 00:23:56.000
Not a little skinny as testing could bring.

481
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.28
And we still played fast piz.

482
00:23:57.28 --> 00:24:00.12
None of this went be slow piz.

483
00:24:00.12 --> 00:24:01.76
And so we won our games.

484
00:24:01.76 --> 00:24:05.24
And so I come in, we land McTar and I and Hutchins.

485
00:24:05.24 --> 00:24:08.20
And we're like literally walking in front of the S3 office.

486
00:24:08.20 --> 00:24:14.44
Just you had a long road that went from highway one east into the compound.

487
00:24:14.44 --> 00:24:16.44
The training centers on the right.

488
00:24:16.44 --> 00:24:17.08
It's all new.

489
00:24:17.08 --> 00:24:20.92
We hear the Vietnamese and we hear a Cambodians on the left.

490
00:24:20.92 --> 00:24:23.56
If you go down and we get in and take our stuff out.

491
00:24:23.56 --> 00:24:25.36
We're just standing, looking stupid.

492
00:24:25.36 --> 00:24:27.92
And then here comes spite or parks.

493
00:24:27.92 --> 00:24:30.16
And it's like whoa, I might glad to see you.

494
00:24:30.16 --> 00:24:30.76
Could we use it?

495
00:24:30.76 --> 00:24:32.64
We were both in a company together.

496
00:24:32.64 --> 00:24:35.84
Spent many months there training up before we came.

497
00:24:35.84 --> 00:24:38.88
And now he, but he was no one that told you what was going on with.

498
00:24:38.88 --> 00:24:42.56
No, because right at that point it was like, hey, and I got a spare bunk.

499
00:24:42.56 --> 00:24:46.48
If he goes in and toss the sergeant majors as I notice, I'll, I'm going to bring him

500
00:24:46.48 --> 00:24:49.72
with me for a couple of days and we'll see what's going to happen.

501
00:24:49.72 --> 00:24:54.64
Because at that point, Spite or had been on Idaho run four or five missions with the sergeant

502
00:24:54.64 --> 00:24:56.14
lane.

503
00:24:56.14 --> 00:24:58.64
And then Lane said you're ready for your own team.

504
00:24:58.64 --> 00:24:59.92
So he promotes them off.

505
00:24:59.92 --> 00:25:02.08
They appointed him as a one zero.

506
00:25:02.08 --> 00:25:06.52
And so he was in that interim time waiting for the transition to come where he's going

507
00:25:06.52 --> 00:25:08.52
to get assigned to team.

508
00:25:08.52 --> 00:25:11.44
And so he's in base.

509
00:25:11.44 --> 00:25:12.44
Team goes out.

510
00:25:12.44 --> 00:25:16.64
So he's got a high degree of interest on what their status is.

511
00:25:16.64 --> 00:25:19.20
So they missed the first common check.

512
00:25:19.20 --> 00:25:22.60
They gave a team okay, which in our case, once you're on the ground, you usually wait

513
00:25:22.60 --> 00:25:26.08
about 10 minutes to see what's going on around you.

514
00:25:26.08 --> 00:25:27.60
They gave a team okay.

515
00:25:27.60 --> 00:25:30.40
Then the assets leave because they can't stay there long anyway.

516
00:25:30.40 --> 00:25:31.72
At least the helicopters.

517
00:25:31.72 --> 00:25:32.72
So they head back.

518
00:25:32.72 --> 00:25:36.20
Which the team okay was breaking Squelch on the radio?

519
00:25:36.20 --> 00:25:37.20
Right.

520
00:25:37.20 --> 00:25:39.20
Generally speaking, yeah.

521
00:25:39.20 --> 00:25:41.16
So for those of you that don't know what that is.

522
00:25:41.16 --> 00:25:43.48
When you break, we squeeze the handset on the radio.

523
00:25:43.48 --> 00:25:45.44
You can tell on the other end.

524
00:25:45.44 --> 00:25:46.44
Okay.

525
00:25:46.44 --> 00:25:49.96
They just purposely squeeze that microphone three times.

526
00:25:49.96 --> 00:25:51.64
We know that that's the signal for okay.

527
00:25:51.64 --> 00:25:52.64
Right.

528
00:25:52.64 --> 00:25:59.24
And sometimes early on the guys may say, team okay, but yeah, later on, that's all it was.

529
00:25:59.24 --> 00:26:04.64
It was a break break and then they say, okay, then coffee will leave.

530
00:26:04.64 --> 00:26:08.08
So they were in and then spider came back later he goes, hey, we haven't heard from

531
00:26:08.08 --> 00:26:09.40
my to hell.

532
00:26:09.40 --> 00:26:13.04
So by dinner time, hey, we haven't heard by Hadoho.

533
00:26:13.04 --> 00:26:14.04
We haven't heard from them.

534
00:26:14.04 --> 00:26:16.36
We're really concerned about what's going on here.

535
00:26:16.36 --> 00:26:22.36
And then by the morning, there's still at that point, not a word.

536
00:26:22.36 --> 00:26:25.60
And what point did you guys get word?

537
00:26:25.60 --> 00:26:31.84
I know what, I'm hazing on how many what the day or time frame was, but eventually another

538
00:26:31.84 --> 00:26:34.32
day decided that it's been too long, no combo.

539
00:26:34.32 --> 00:26:38.64
They put in what they call a bright light, which is a team that goes into either fine

540
00:26:38.64 --> 00:26:42.68
the other team, if just casualties or downpilest.

541
00:26:42.68 --> 00:26:44.24
That's what the bright light missions were.

542
00:26:44.24 --> 00:26:50.12
Downpilest, bring relief or just bring casualties out or help people get the team out

543
00:26:50.12 --> 00:26:51.96
the wounded team.

544
00:26:51.96 --> 00:26:56.28
So they went in and a team that went in, everybody was wounded, one guy was killed.

545
00:26:56.28 --> 00:26:57.68
This is from the team that went in.

546
00:26:57.68 --> 00:26:58.68
Went in for the bright light.

547
00:26:58.68 --> 00:27:00.32
This is Oregon.

548
00:27:00.32 --> 00:27:01.32
Correct.

549
00:27:01.32 --> 00:27:02.32
Yeah.

550
00:27:02.32 --> 00:27:09.72
With Mike Tucker and George, the troll stirmer, they went in and at one point, they were thrown

551
00:27:09.72 --> 00:27:11.84
in a bomb crater.

552
00:27:11.84 --> 00:27:18.04
And so the NVA, we're hitting them with our weapons, Car 15 fire, they had our M26

553
00:27:18.04 --> 00:27:22.40
and the flag grenades, one of which blew off George's jungle boot.

554
00:27:22.40 --> 00:27:26.08
So all these guys were really banged up pretty bad when they came out.

555
00:27:26.08 --> 00:27:27.08
And they got out.

556
00:27:27.08 --> 00:27:29.40
And they didn't find anybody from Idaho.

557
00:27:29.40 --> 00:27:30.40
Correct.

558
00:27:30.40 --> 00:27:35.40
I'm going to take it back to the book here.

559
00:27:35.40 --> 00:27:45.20
This is sort of the reaction back at FOB1 when Oregon comes back.

560
00:27:45.20 --> 00:27:49.12
The kick base, there was a collective sigh of relief that ST Oregon had survived the short

561
00:27:49.12 --> 00:27:52.68
lift but furious but ferocious bright light mission.

562
00:27:52.68 --> 00:27:59.92
The loss of ST Idaho, however, hung over the camp like an invisible fog.

563
00:27:59.92 --> 00:28:03.56
Spider was the first person I spoke to after that bright light.

564
00:28:03.56 --> 00:28:07.84
He went straight to the bar, unable to believe that ST Idaho had vanished.

565
00:28:07.84 --> 00:28:12.44
The complete lack of clues added to the mystery, where they killed, where they wounded

566
00:28:12.44 --> 00:28:19.04
the captured and now prisoners of the NVA, and that entire voice, everyone's next thought.

567
00:28:19.04 --> 00:28:24.32
Before he'd be captured by the NVA, he said he'd kill himself with a round from his car

568
00:28:24.32 --> 00:28:30.20
15 or pretend to be dead and blow up as many NVA as possible with one final hand grenade.

569
00:28:30.20 --> 00:28:32.24
There was no doubt in my mind.

570
00:28:32.24 --> 00:28:34.04
I'd never be taken alive.

571
00:28:34.04 --> 00:28:40.44
From that day forward, I always carried an M26 frag grenade on the upper hook of my web gear.

572
00:28:40.44 --> 00:28:43.04
It was the last one I'd used.

573
00:28:43.04 --> 00:28:46.16
I would use.

574
00:28:46.16 --> 00:28:50.68
Welcome to CNC, McIntyre Muddered.

575
00:28:50.68 --> 00:28:59.64
We had heard about ST Asp from FOB4 vanishing and loused, presumed KIA on 28 March 1968.

576
00:28:59.64 --> 00:29:01.68
But there were others.

577
00:29:01.68 --> 00:29:06.20
Sergeant 1st class Robert L. Taylor killed 4 April.

578
00:29:06.20 --> 00:29:10.96
ST Bear from FOB3 KIA loused.

579
00:29:10.96 --> 00:29:16.24
Major George Cuomo, U17 crash died 14 April.

580
00:29:16.24 --> 00:29:23.48
FOB5 based Spite Team members, Sergeant 1st class Lee Roy and Wright and Staff Sergeant Lloyd F.

581
00:29:23.48 --> 00:29:28.64
Mussel, KIA Fishook area of Cambodia, 2 May.

582
00:29:28.64 --> 00:29:37.80
FOB2 based Lieutenant Joseph C. Schrieve, KIA Hatchett 4 Operation 1 May.

583
00:29:37.80 --> 00:29:45.64
FOB1 based ST Alabama Team members, Specialist 5th class Kenneth M. Cryon and Private

584
00:29:45.64 --> 00:29:52.64
1st class Paul Chester King, KIA, A. Schow target 4 May.

585
00:29:52.64 --> 00:29:58.60
FOB1 Hatchett 4 Sergeant 1st class Ronald J. Miller, KIA 12 May.

586
00:29:58.60 --> 00:30:04.84
FOB1 based Master Sergeant Robert D. Plato and 1st and Sergeant 1st class John Hartley

587
00:30:04.84 --> 00:30:10.72
Robertson, KIA King B. Helicopter Krausch, Crash Loused 20 May.

588
00:30:10.72 --> 00:30:17.36
Additionally, 5 SF troops were killed at FOB3 from mortar and artillery strappinol between

589
00:30:17.36 --> 00:30:21.36
15 and 21 April 1968.

590
00:30:21.36 --> 00:30:28.84
Specialist 5th class Charles M. Corey Specialist 5th class Daniel F. Sandival, Sergeant

591
00:30:28.84 --> 00:30:38.32
Dennis Thorpe, Sergeant 1st class Stefan Mazak and Specialist 5th class Samuel R. Hughes.

592
00:30:38.32 --> 00:30:43.08
McIntyre and I didn't personally know any of the KIAs, but the sheer number in that

593
00:30:43.08 --> 00:30:51.24
short period of time was sobering. Most of them were veteran special forces soldiers.

594
00:30:51.24 --> 00:31:02.36
King is green as we were made us all the more nervous, but not scared enough to quit CNC.

595
00:31:02.36 --> 00:31:07.56
That's quite the welcome aboard.

596
00:31:07.56 --> 00:31:13.76
Well yeah, then one little side note on Spiderman Parks on that bright light. When the team

597
00:31:13.76 --> 00:31:19.72
came out, there was so shot up because one of the team members got a disney wounded on

598
00:31:19.72 --> 00:31:25.56
the extraction that they never gave a team okay. Spiderman down with a King B. Separate

599
00:31:25.56 --> 00:31:32.84
King B. God out looking to make sure everybody was out. And they took a tense fire.

600
00:31:32.84 --> 00:31:39.000
That King B got fired up and on extraction, the door gunner was KIA on that. So Spiderman

601
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.48
was quite a mess when he got back.

602
00:31:46.48 --> 00:31:50.40
Yeah, that was such a short period of time to be losing all those guys. That's a matter

603
00:31:50.40 --> 00:31:59.20
of months. Oh yeah. And we left the subway out.

604
00:31:59.20 --> 00:32:05.76
So these Spike teams going in. Were you explained a little bit about what the Spike teams

605
00:32:05.76 --> 00:32:12.64
were? The Spike teams were the code name for our recontimes. They had two basic elements

606
00:32:12.64 --> 00:32:18.80
with CNC. The hatch of force which could be a company, a petriner, a company size operation.

607
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.000
And then the recontimes which we had would be two or three Americans with the corresponding number

608
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.44
of indigenous troops. So, initially we ran three Americans with three South Vietnamese.

609
00:32:33.44 --> 00:32:39.84
The South Vietnamese and our team were really good. And then later, they were so good. I just ran

610
00:32:39.84 --> 00:32:48.08
myself in a one-one with four of the ditch. And we trained up heavily, particularly up to that.

611
00:32:48.08 --> 00:32:54.32
And then, learn who the best ones were. And we had a couple of the guys that had been like

612
00:32:54.32 --> 00:33:00.24
hept or an interpreter, SAL, who had been there. They've been running business for two years

613
00:33:00.24 --> 00:33:07.28
by 68. So they were highly respected. In fact, only about a grace of God, they weren't on the

614
00:33:07.28 --> 00:33:13.20
team that disappeared because we were able to build around them. You have this other part in the

615
00:33:13.20 --> 00:33:20.000
book here. This is another sort of welcome to FOB1. During the first few weeks, in FOB1,

616
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.76
I attended at least three memorial services for fallen SF comrades. Services were held in the

617
00:33:25.76 --> 00:33:30.48
mess hall. The last one I attended was for Lane and Owens. During the service, the chaplain

618
00:33:30.48 --> 00:33:36.48
hesitated on Lane's name. This was the last official function honoring Spike Team Adaho's members,

619
00:33:37.20 --> 00:33:41.44
and the chaplain couldn't remember Lane's name. I didn't care if he had attended to

620
00:33:41.44 --> 00:33:47.04
dozen memorial services for other branches of the military. That day, I was so angry. I never

621
00:33:47.04 --> 00:33:53.60
attended another memorial service at FOB1. The services soon stopped anyway because there were

622
00:33:53.60 --> 00:34:07.12
so many casualties, no official announcement. They just stopped. Yeah, you and I were talking a little

623
00:34:07.12 --> 00:34:13.60
bit about a Ramadhi when we were in Ramadhi and the one thing that we started doing immediately

624
00:34:13.60 --> 00:34:17.92
was going to the memorial services of the soldiers and Marines that were getting killed. And that

625
00:34:17.92 --> 00:34:25.84
was a big wake-up call for everybody. I can tell you, I don't think probably anyone in my task unit

626
00:34:25.84 --> 00:34:34.08
had ever been to a memorial service overseas for guys that had been killed. I mean, and here

627
00:34:34.08 --> 00:34:39.28
we were there with their happening every day. You never think about it? No. To your there. No.

628
00:34:39.92 --> 00:34:43.20
And you guys that were having so many casualties that they just said, okay, well we're not

629
00:34:43.20 --> 00:34:54.88
going to have them anymore. Here's talking about some of your first few operations that you

630
00:34:54.88 --> 00:35:01.76
went on. And I don't think I've talked about this, but so these little teams that you had.

631
00:35:01.76 --> 00:35:10.48
Yeah. These little teams were getting into helicopters and flying over the fence, which means

632
00:35:10.48 --> 00:35:21.36
over the border into Lous and Cambodia to do reconnaissance pretty much in the middle of nowhere by

633
00:35:21.36 --> 00:35:29.12
yourselves. Correct. This type of operation in present day is not very likely to happen.

634
00:35:29.12 --> 00:35:34.16
The amount of risk that you guys were taken, it's it's crazy to read about like my

635
00:35:34.16 --> 00:35:40.08
my personal contingency that I'm running through my head. You know, what if this happened? What if

636
00:35:40.08 --> 00:35:44.32
that happens? Right. I'm looking at these saying, yeah, if I was the commander in charge, I'd say,

637
00:35:44.32 --> 00:35:48.000
well, you need to come up with a better plan. You need to come up with something where we have

638
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.80
better backup, especially when the situation is because you guys can get air support and you guys

639
00:35:52.80 --> 00:35:57.92
used it heavily, but as soon as the weather rolled in, it was like, you guys are out there on your own.

640
00:35:57.92 --> 00:36:02.64
And I mean, we'll get into some stories. We're out there on your own. For sure.

641
00:36:02.64 --> 00:36:12.000
And you know, and that element of this nextary contingency, we had no artillery,

642
00:36:12.64 --> 00:36:18.72
no traditional army or marine corps support, and of course no seal teams. They were busy doing

643
00:36:18.72 --> 00:36:26.24
this stuff on the coast. And so it was quite something, go across the fence. And in a way,

644
00:36:26.24 --> 00:36:33.44
we were flying into the 18th century because everything was so old, the way of working.

645
00:36:34.24 --> 00:36:38.56
And they said, do slasher and burn agriculture. So you come in with the helicopter,

646
00:36:38.56 --> 00:36:43.84
everybody will hear you coming. And the local people had to cooperate with the NVA, because their

647
00:36:43.84 --> 00:36:51.76
model was work with us. We're going to kill your dumbass. So the game was on. And the purpose of

648
00:36:51.76 --> 00:36:57.68
most of these was to figure out where the trails were, what was being transported, where the location

649
00:36:57.68 --> 00:37:03.68
of enemy personnel were. It was basic reconnaissance missions, right? Well, in addition to, yes,

650
00:37:03.68 --> 00:37:06.88
that was the first part. So you always had general missions. Here's a point mission,

651
00:37:08.16 --> 00:37:13.76
because by the end of 68, they were building fuel lines from the north. They were coming down.

652
00:37:14.32 --> 00:37:20.96
They were going across the DMZ river in Laos. And so we heard reports about that. So that could be

653
00:37:20.96 --> 00:37:27.20
a point mission or general re-conocity where the movement's gone, what supplies are. And then

654
00:37:27.20 --> 00:37:34.000
wire taps, fuel, W snatch, and those were the other missions. And so our south-view and the

655
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.64
meters are trained. We trained them up so back then we had stadium art and cassette player, right?

656
00:37:41.28 --> 00:37:46.72
And south could climb up a telephone pole, hook it up, and then cover to wire all the way up

657
00:37:46.72 --> 00:37:52.24
with mud. So if anybody walked past, they would never see that wire. And we would record,

658
00:37:52.24 --> 00:37:57.44
because the CIA told us, if you record, even though you don't hear anything, keep it on.

659
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.60
Because when you get those tastes back to it, we're going to amplify it a hundred times,

660
00:38:01.60 --> 00:38:08.24
because the north Vietnamese phones even over in the cradle, they're still on. And we could record it.

661
00:38:08.24 --> 00:38:11.68
They'd amplify it and they could hear people talking to the background, get in tell off of that.

662
00:38:11.68 --> 00:38:18.96
So does it some of the other missions? So you start going on your first few operations here.

663
00:38:20.40 --> 00:38:23.60
And by the next morning, back to the book, by the next morning, the weathered broken and we were

664
00:38:23.60 --> 00:38:28.80
inserted smack dab in the middle of the biggest road running north to south through the A-show valley.

665
00:38:28.80 --> 00:38:36.16
Am I saying that right? S-show. S-show valley. There was no jungle. There were however, hundreds of

666
00:38:36.16 --> 00:38:42.08
bomb creators of various sizes. But what surprised me the most was a number of punji pits that we passed.

667
00:38:42.08 --> 00:38:48.96
Some were huge, large enough for animals. And you go through this mission, this one of your first

668
00:38:48.96 --> 00:38:53.28
missions, and there's like no enemy contact. And one of the guys who were walking in and I looked at

669
00:38:53.28 --> 00:38:57.68
each other and complete disbelief. We had just walked down into the valley, the shadow of death without

670
00:38:57.68 --> 00:39:02.72
seeing one NVA soldier. Spider-Joke with me saying that, I was one of the few people in the history of

671
00:39:02.72 --> 00:39:08.000
CNC to have a run, a practice mission, and two missions, and still have not gotten the combat

672
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.20
infantryman's badge. The award given to soldiers who had seen combat with the enemy or were

673
00:39:13.20 --> 00:39:18.24
under direct hostile fire. I kept telling myself that this was a fluke, and I remembered what

674
00:39:18.24 --> 00:39:23.68
the special forces trainers told us at Fort Bragg, the NVA and the Viet Congrillas will fight

675
00:39:23.68 --> 00:39:30.56
when they want to no sooner. So your first couple of operations, you got pretty, uh, pretty lucky.

676
00:39:30.56 --> 00:39:36.000
Oh yeah, we're a slayer. Snails not. We went in and put in those Air Force sensors, and then

677
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.80
we had all this here. Tackier stacked up. Could we just figured it's going to be a shit show?

678
00:39:40.80 --> 00:39:46.24
Nothing happened. So we left out some poor support and Viet gunner opens up with a 50 caliber.

679
00:39:46.24 --> 00:39:52.56
They killed him several times, man. Napom bombs. Because they wanted to use sub-domus, big mission.

680
00:39:52.56 --> 00:39:59.28
Right. Where you uh, the other interesting thing that you talk about in the book, uh,

681
00:39:59.28 --> 00:40:03.12
I don't think it was one of yours, but even when you guys would do training missions over there,

682
00:40:03.12 --> 00:40:06.48
that was like a potential for enemy contact on your training missions. Absolutely.

683
00:40:06.48 --> 00:40:11.68
Yeah, Lynn Black and his team, they ran the heavy contact. In fact, it was the navy that saved

684
00:40:11.68 --> 00:40:15.84
their dumbass, all that one training mission, because they just happened to have the frequency.

685
00:40:15.84 --> 00:40:20.88
The king, he's couldn't get in and they called the navy and they came in, I don't know, a big boat.

686
00:40:20.88 --> 00:40:26.24
Yeah. Yeah. Some kind of big boat. That's really long. But they came in and pulled their ass out.

687
00:40:26.24 --> 00:40:30.32
Good. They, the Viet Kong must have a couple hundred people who were coming after.

688
00:40:30.32 --> 00:40:34.16
And they, they were just out trying to do like a shake out patrol with just a little training

689
00:40:34.16 --> 00:40:38.80
operation. Yeah, just a little in country thing. You know, it's just go train, get a couple of days,

690
00:40:38.80 --> 00:40:46.24
get out of camp, eat some, eat some lurps, have some fun. Well, you're uh, you're luck didn't hold

691
00:40:46.24 --> 00:40:52.32
up. Yes. Going back to the book. And is this guy's name Sal, am I saying that right? Perfect. Okay.

692
00:40:52.32 --> 00:40:57.68
By now, Sal, eyes were, Sal's eyes were bigger than sauces. So you've been inserted and now you,

693
00:40:57.68 --> 00:41:01.60
you're starting to have a situation unfold. If you raise spider walk and said,

694
00:41:02.56 --> 00:41:07.76
tell him I'm declaring Prairie Fire Emergency. If he says anything about not hearing any gunshots,

695
00:41:07.76 --> 00:41:13.60
tell him to fuck off. I'll explain later. Sal's never been wrong. Look at him. As we spoke,

696
00:41:13.60 --> 00:41:22.48
Sal looked at us. Boku VC, Boku VC, call King B's now. He whispered. And then you get on the horn.

697
00:41:22.48 --> 00:41:28.16
I have a Prairie Fire Emergency team in distress. I have a Prairie Fire Emergency. Can anyone

698
00:41:28.16 --> 00:41:35.04
hear me? I spoke in a hushed tone with my hand, cut over the mouth of the radio. I looked at my

699
00:41:35.04 --> 00:41:40.40
watch. We still had more than a hundred minutes before our next schedule to commo check with spider

700
00:41:40.40 --> 00:41:51.12
at 1600. No one responded. So the deal with comm windows are back in the day when we had batteries

701
00:41:51.12 --> 00:41:56.08
that would run out. You couldn't just sit there and monitor the radio all the time. On either side,

702
00:41:56.08 --> 00:42:01.68
people that were waiting for you to call, they'd be waiting and they wouldn't monitor the whole

703
00:42:01.68 --> 00:42:07.12
time so they would come up at certain predesignated communication windows. So that's what's going on

704
00:42:07.12 --> 00:42:13.04
here. You have this bad situation unfolding and you go to call, but they're not particularly listening

705
00:42:13.04 --> 00:42:17.36
at that moment, which is why no one's responding. Right. You know, I'm just explaining that to

706
00:42:17.36 --> 00:42:22.000
some folks that is nowadays we have, well, first of all, we have cell phones. We call anyone

707
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.72
whenever we want it to make some nice ring tone and you talk to everyone there. Even when I got in,

708
00:42:26.72 --> 00:42:31.04
we had comm windows. Oh, is that right? Yeah, yeah, we set up comms. I was a comm guy too. Sure,

709
00:42:31.04 --> 00:42:35.44
we set up comm windows and we'll call you, you know, whatever it was every two hours or whatever.

710
00:42:35.44 --> 00:42:42.08
And that's the situation that's unfolding right here. You guys still hadn't been contacted yet.

711
00:42:42.08 --> 00:42:48.56
So back to the book, I sat down with my back against the PRC 25 and opened a can of apricots.

712
00:42:49.36 --> 00:42:54.96
I was facing south and just starting to sip the sweet apricot nectar when all hell broke loose.

713
00:42:55.60 --> 00:43:00.88
The green jungle around us are rusted with deafening full automatic blasts from NVAA-AK-47s

714
00:43:00.88 --> 00:43:07.20
and R-KAR-15s because my back was to them. I hadn't seen sales warning gestures or watched him get

715
00:43:07.20 --> 00:43:13.84
the jump on the approaching NVAA. I remember spilling apricot nectar on the stock of my car 15.

716
00:43:13.84 --> 00:43:19.68
As I turned to my left with a majority of the NVAA gunfire was coming from foolishly. My first

717
00:43:19.68 --> 00:43:24.72
thoughts were that I'd have to clean off the nectar off my weapon and not spill the entire

718
00:43:24.72 --> 00:43:31.76
can of apricot apricots because I had waited so damn long to eat them. They were always a treat in the jungle.

719
00:43:33.12 --> 00:43:37.28
But the initial seconds of the firefight I remember saw and how do I say his name?

720
00:43:37.28 --> 00:43:42.72
FEP? What a fuck. Yeah. Fuck. Fuck yelling profanities at the NVAA as they fired on full

721
00:43:42.72 --> 00:43:47.92
automatic. The crack of AK-47 rounds had never sounded louder or closer. All I could see from our

722
00:43:47.92 --> 00:43:52.80
perimeter was gun smoke. The red and orange blast coming from the darker than ever green jungle

723
00:43:52.80 --> 00:43:58.88
and the green AK-47 tracer flying overheads. In an odd sort of way there was an eerie beauty to

724
00:43:58.88 --> 00:44:04.24
the scene. The thunderous fury of dozens of men blasting away each other on full automatic within

725
00:44:04.24 --> 00:44:10.08
10 feet of each other killed all other sounds. The ear drums were numb. A adrenaline slammed into

726
00:44:10.08 --> 00:44:15.44
our bloodstreams and was now screaming through our systems. It heightened all senses. It extended

727
00:44:15.44 --> 00:44:21.84
time. For example, a car 15 fires 20 rounds of 556 high velocity ammunition in less than one and a half

728
00:44:21.84 --> 00:44:28.56
seconds. Yet those first opening moments of combat with the NVAA seemed much longer than a half a second.

729
00:44:28.56 --> 00:44:32.88
Then the second and a half. Or nearly when firing on full automatic the weapon

730
00:44:32.88 --> 00:44:36.88
expended rounds quickly and we trained ourselves to try and gauge when that last round in the

731
00:44:36.88 --> 00:44:41.76
magazine was slamming into the receiver. Some men placed a trace around in the magazine

732
00:44:41.76 --> 00:44:47.12
as a visual cue. During that firefight it seemed as though I counted the rounds leaving the

733
00:44:47.12 --> 00:44:53.04
car 15 and knew exactly when the 18th and last round was exiting the weapon. Also during that first

734
00:44:53.04 --> 00:44:58.64
expane exchange, full quiz slightly behind me to my right and since I was on the ground he was

735
00:44:58.64 --> 00:45:04.08
firing over my shoulder. That exposed my right ear to almost a full blast from his car 15.

736
00:45:04.08 --> 00:45:10.16
The explosions were painful but fuck saved my life. I had aimed the car 15 down the hill toward

737
00:45:10.16 --> 00:45:15.60
the largest number of AK-47 muzzle flashes that I could see to my left what I hadn't seen were

738
00:45:15.60 --> 00:45:21.68
a handful of NVAA soldiers who broke out of the jungle to the right and had opened fire on us.

739
00:45:21.68 --> 00:45:26.80
Fuck realized I hadn't seen the NVAA troops coming up the hill so we got to my right and

740
00:45:26.80 --> 00:45:32.32
blasted them back into the jungle. I was so focused on the first muzzle flashes that I completely

741
00:45:32.32 --> 00:45:37.28
missed the others. If those NVAA soldiers had advanced a few more feet we would have been history

742
00:45:37.28 --> 00:45:42.24
and the remainder of the team which was on my left would have been at risk. That time war

743
00:45:42.24 --> 00:45:48.96
continued when everybody ran out of bullets simultaneously. The only audible, the only sounds

744
00:45:48.96 --> 00:45:53.52
audible were the metal clicks of cold magazines being slammed into hot machine guns and

745
00:45:53.52 --> 00:46:00.24
bolts slamming shut to resume the firefight. A key element in any firefight is the race to reload

746
00:46:00.24 --> 00:46:08.64
after the initial contact. On 7 October 1968, ST Idaho won the race. No one was faster than

747
00:46:08.64 --> 00:46:17.84
SAU, heep, heep, heep, heep, folk at getting the first magazine out the second one in and returning

748
00:46:17.84 --> 00:46:22.96
full automatic gunfire on the enemy. Within seconds we had gained fire superiority. The months and

749
00:46:22.96 --> 00:46:29.36
months of training on the range under the 2-delegive spider and walkin all of the live fire drills,

750
00:46:29.36 --> 00:46:35.84
all the live fire races to see who finished reloading first, paid off. All other games in life

751
00:46:35.84 --> 00:46:42.80
were frivolous and irrelevant. In this deadly game, if you missed hitting the target, you died.

752
00:46:45.04 --> 00:46:51.52
So that was your first big contact, huh? That was it. That's a doozy. It was absolutely.

753
00:46:51.52 --> 00:46:57.44
And it still sticks with us, you know, never forget it. And fuck, I mean later wrong we're back

754
00:46:57.44 --> 00:47:03.76
in base. I was complain. I'm glad you didn't realize what had happened. And so talking through

755
00:47:03.76 --> 00:47:09.28
the interpreter said you'd dump fucker. I just saved your ass. These guys were coming up to

756
00:47:09.28 --> 00:47:12.96
Hill on you're too stupid to realize it. Oh, so you were mad at him for shooting too close to

757
00:47:12.96 --> 00:47:18.96
you? Oh yeah, because my ear was just fucked. I couldn't hear for days. It's like so thanks for

758
00:47:18.96 --> 00:47:27.12
saving my life on complainer. Classic. Oh yeah. You continue on with this a little bit as

759
00:47:27.12 --> 00:47:31.44
as we gain complete fire superiority. I turned on the URC 10 beeper and started screaming into

760
00:47:31.44 --> 00:47:38.16
the PRC 25. I have a fucking prairie fire emergency that bitter fear-laced plea was greeted with

761
00:47:38.16 --> 00:47:44.88
complete silence. Woken was less than subtle. Keep yelling until you get someone. A key factor

762
00:47:44.88 --> 00:47:50.32
in SDI to host favor that day was the small null that woken is driven us to. The jungle is so thick

763
00:47:50.32 --> 00:47:55.68
and the null is so small that only a score of NVA could rush at once. They weren't moved. They weren't

764
00:47:55.68 --> 00:48:01.36
fast moving. Fear inspiring charges that the NVA were known for successfully executing

765
00:48:01.36 --> 00:48:07.28
either. Here the jungle worked against them but the NVA kept coming. At one point, Wolk and pulled

766
00:48:07.28 --> 00:48:11.92
me over pointed into the jungle and said, look, they're stacking up dead bodies to get to us.

767
00:48:12.80 --> 00:48:19.20
Hip showed me. Can you believe it? And they keep coming. Hell, if we kill enough of them,

768
00:48:19.20 --> 00:48:25.36
the body stack will be as high as we are. Because the jungle area was so dark at first. I couldn't

769
00:48:25.36 --> 00:48:30.24
tell exactly what I was looking at but Wolk and his right. The NVA were stacking bodies and firing

770
00:48:30.24 --> 00:48:36.48
it from behind their dead comrades. A lot of NVA soldiers died in those first few minutes of how on earth.

771
00:48:39.36 --> 00:48:45.36
That's a determined enemy. Oh yeah. And we heard about, you know, it's one thing to hear about

772
00:48:45.36 --> 00:48:53.28
it basically and the press of force is training how determined the enemy was. And the see it

773
00:48:53.28 --> 00:48:59.52
firsthand. Dying like that. I mean, Lily just kept coming and we had high ground. You know,

774
00:48:59.52 --> 00:49:05.28
thank God for high ground thick jungle and the fact that it wasn't a big area where they could

775
00:49:05.28 --> 00:49:10.24
mass more. You guys didn't bring a, you guys didn't have an automatic weapon with you.

776
00:49:10.24 --> 00:49:14.08
You guys didn't have an A-Dob like a like a belt fed machine gun. You guys wouldn't carry those?

777
00:49:14.64 --> 00:49:20.08
No, we had a sick, well, in the case of six-man team. And the team's some of the teams began

778
00:49:20.08 --> 00:49:28.16
carrying the M60 a little later. And then the R-P-G because they cut the barrel off and it had the

779
00:49:29.52 --> 00:49:36.32
the magazine, the circular magazine, the holes. I think it's 200, 250 rounds. God. But they

780
00:49:36.32 --> 00:49:42.16
with something to do. But in our case, because we carried the M79 also, it solved off M79. God,

781
00:49:42.16 --> 00:49:46.64
gave you a lot of extra firepower. But did you use the full of shut rounds without or just the just the

782
00:49:46.64 --> 00:49:52.16
H-E. But the first round would be flesh-shat. So if anything was close, that would be the first round

783
00:49:52.16 --> 00:49:59.60
and then we needed the H-E-E-E rounds. For no A-W, man, that's it. This, when I hear that story right

784
00:49:59.60 --> 00:50:04.08
there, I would do anything to have an M60 machine gun. Oh yeah, that's your way, shit. Absolutely.

785
00:50:06.32 --> 00:50:10.24
But just the weight, the rounds and everything else, you know, like a my case, I carried the

786
00:50:10.24 --> 00:50:15.28
radio, always carried the radio. Yeah. And so between the radio, the battery, and we always had

787
00:50:15.28 --> 00:50:20.96
600 plus rounds. We were, I was on my first deployment to Iraq. I was on like one of my first

788
00:50:20.96 --> 00:50:31.20
controls in a humvise and we were out and we ended up, we hit a little, I don't know what you call

789
00:50:31.20 --> 00:50:35.76
them, the steel hedgehog, do you know what that is? It's like a little obstacle, right? That Americans

790
00:50:35.76 --> 00:50:40.48
had put out. Americans had put it out, a steel hedgehog, a little obstacle for those of you don't

791
00:50:40.48 --> 00:50:45.76
know, it's to prevent cars from going by. Well, we, we made a wrong term somewhere and we went

792
00:50:45.76 --> 00:50:50.80
down road, we weren't supposed to go to and we hit one of those little steel hedgehogs. We didn't

793
00:50:50.80 --> 00:50:56.16
know what it was. So we're driving like, it's actually my humvise too and it made it loud noise

794
00:50:56.16 --> 00:51:00.72
and sparked and I actually thought in my mind, I thought we just got hit with a low order ID,

795
00:51:00.72 --> 00:51:06.000
like a low order boo, boo, boo, boo, we tripped that didn't fully explode. So we come to a stop

796
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.84
and we all get out of the vehicles and now we're in the middle of Baghdad and there were just

797
00:51:11.84 --> 00:51:17.52
surrounded by threats and in our mind we're about to be attacked because we didn't know that we just

798
00:51:17.52 --> 00:51:22.96
ran over our American thing but we're too stupid. We don't know. We don't know that. So everyone's

799
00:51:22.96 --> 00:51:29.36
out there, we're all out there with our, with our M4s, our little basically car 15s and you are like

800
00:51:29.36 --> 00:51:34.000
I felt completely naked. I was saying myself, God, we know what, we need better weapons.

801
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.44
Now we had 50 cows mounted in the humvise but once we were mobile, I'm thinking we do, why don't

802
00:51:39.44 --> 00:51:44.24
we have, why don't we have belt fed machine guns? When I got, when we got back that night,

803
00:51:44.24 --> 00:51:49.52
it wasn't just me that felt like that because that night, all my guys, they went in every humv

804
00:51:49.52 --> 00:51:53.60
every input belt fed machine guns, we mounted and we staged them. So anytime we got out of

805
00:51:53.60 --> 00:51:59.20
those vehicles, we were ready to go to war. Oh yeah, yeah. Particularly in the situation like that

806
00:51:59.20 --> 00:52:03.52
because you can have all the limit to people coming out of these. I have a little nuts. But yeah, that

807
00:52:03.52 --> 00:52:09.12
naked feeling, yeah, because in a w in a situation like this, that'd be nice. Going back to the

808
00:52:09.12 --> 00:52:16.96
book, more than an hour, my cries and screams into the radio and the URC 10 beeper went unanswered

809
00:52:16.96 --> 00:52:22.48
as the NVA mounted more attacks. There was no need for radio secure procedures. Now the

810
00:52:22.48 --> 00:52:26.48
hide and seek portion of the game was over. Now it was simply a matter of survival. My respect

811
00:52:26.48 --> 00:52:32.32
for the NVA's to nasty grew that day, but the hill, the jungle in our car 15s, worked against

812
00:52:32.32 --> 00:52:37.28
them as they continued to pile up or drag away more bodies. With no help around,

813
00:52:37.28 --> 00:52:42.56
conserving ammo while keeping the enemy back became a top priority. There were no more full

814
00:52:42.56 --> 00:52:46.96
automatic blasts from us, although we had been in contact less than two hours. It felt like we've

815
00:52:46.96 --> 00:52:54.000
been fighting for several. As the team anxiously awaited for help from above, the few team members

816
00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:02.48
pitted against the enemy NVA seemed ludicrous in terms of survival. The enormity of the jungle hit home.

817
00:53:02.48 --> 00:53:06.72
Yes, so you got, how many rounds did you say you would bring? Well, he always carried 600 plus.

818
00:53:07.28 --> 00:53:11.36
Per man. Oh, no, the Vietnamese were carried a light of load because they could

819
00:53:11.36 --> 00:53:18.000
just be only like 98 pounds. So I forget what they're load. And you guys had 20 round magazines at this

820
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.32
point, right? Correct. Now, 30 were just a dream we thought about. And a couple of guys were smart enough

821
00:53:24.32 --> 00:53:30.32
to write the call order and they had a mail to them later. We weren't that smart. So we had the

822
00:53:30.32 --> 00:53:36.56
20 rounds, but because of the spring you only put 18. Yeah. And so you're taking at some point,

823
00:53:36.56 --> 00:53:41.20
probably how long into this are you starting to take point shots instead of, oh yeah,

824
00:53:41.20 --> 00:53:49.28
he's just waiting till things come out. You see it and then just one, two. Finally, I heard the

825
00:53:49.28 --> 00:53:54.40
Texas draw of Spiderman on the radio and have four phantom jet returning from a bombing run in northern

826
00:53:54.40 --> 00:53:59.76
louss and heard the beeper and called him. I told Spiderman we had a Perry Fryer, Perry Fryer

827
00:53:59.76 --> 00:54:04.96
emergency. Spiderman said that he had also called the judge and the executioner. Who are the

828
00:54:04.96 --> 00:54:11.92
judge and the executioner? They were pilots for the 176th of America out division and they

829
00:54:11.92 --> 00:54:19.04
were the muskets. And they had been assigned permanently to CNC earlier in the year,

830
00:54:19.04 --> 00:54:25.68
they built the camp duck and then they had been assigned, when camp duck was closed down,

831
00:54:26.48 --> 00:54:30.80
they came to food by. And they actually built a barracks that the helicopter possibly stay and

832
00:54:30.80 --> 00:54:36.56
they were one of the crews, them and the Marine Corps, a scarfase, were a gunster that

833
00:54:36.56 --> 00:54:44.32
regularly hung out with us and saved our bacon. So the judge, they had these old guns,

834
00:54:44.32 --> 00:54:50.24
they could barely get off the ground. But he had the rockapods and then the executioner was a

835
00:54:50.24 --> 00:54:59.20
cook and he had the minigun. Those are some awesome call signs. Oh yeah. Going back to the book,

836
00:54:59.20 --> 00:55:03.36
thankfully we had made mirror contact with Spiderman earlier and he was able to pinpoint our location

837
00:55:03.36 --> 00:55:08.08
in a matter of minutes. Soon Spiderman was over us. He told me to pop smoke. Our SOP was not to say

838
00:55:08.08 --> 00:55:14.16
what color smoke grenade we would use. Soon the NVA were monitoring our FM frequency. I popped a yellow

839
00:55:14.16 --> 00:55:19.12
smoke. He said he saw two yellows which meant the NVA were monitoring our frequency and it guessed

840
00:55:19.12 --> 00:55:25.28
which color we would use. We changed frequencies and I popped a violet smoke. A few minutes later,

841
00:55:25.28 --> 00:55:32.80
the first A1E Skyrader arrived on target and made a gun run on our eastern perimeter. His wing

842
00:55:32.80 --> 00:55:37.84
man made the first Napomron on the south side. Put your heads down. I'm going to make you sweat. He said

843
00:55:38.56 --> 00:55:43.60
he brought it so close. We could feel the heat from the deadly jelly. A few seconds later,

844
00:55:43.60 --> 00:55:50.16
we smelled burning flesh. He dive toward us a third time. The pilot drawred its crispy critter time.

845
00:55:50.16 --> 00:55:57.28
The Napomron was so close we could feel the air being sucked away from us by the exploding material.

846
00:55:57.28 --> 00:56:01.28
If the jelly landed on a person's skin it would continue to burn. Either until it burned itself

847
00:56:01.28 --> 00:56:06.72
out or is deprived of air by mud or some other substance. The spads arrival changed the temple

848
00:56:06.72 --> 00:56:12.16
the firefight when the NVA heard the old World War II plane making another run they charged us in

849
00:56:12.16 --> 00:56:17.76
a desperate attempt to get as close as they could in order to avoid the skyraders deadly ordinance.

850
00:56:17.76 --> 00:56:23.04
The NVA were getting close to the belt. That's horrifying. So those that don't understand the

851
00:56:23.04 --> 00:56:27.60
tactics of that situation. You got aircraft overhead. They're dropping Napom. So what do you

852
00:56:27.60 --> 00:56:32.80
think? Oh, cool. That'll make the NVA run away. No. No. Actually what they wanted to get close enough

853
00:56:32.80 --> 00:56:39.60
to Americans that they can't get Napom dropped on them. By 68 they had the attack down really

854
00:56:39.60 --> 00:56:44.32
tight. They knew when they aircraft were there that they were safe for the closer to us and then

855
00:56:44.32 --> 00:56:50.000
so they get closer or hopefully the wipe us out and to say their own ass. That's like there's

856
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.20
I guess there's no higher motivation than that Napom coming out of you if you stay where you're out.

857
00:56:55.20 --> 00:57:02.24
Nasty. And so therefore even that that stage of the game we had to go back to full

858
00:57:02.24 --> 00:57:07.92
automatic couple times because they're charging hard. Oh yeah. What numbers are we talking about?

859
00:57:08.56 --> 00:57:13.36
Never knew. We just stacked them up so high. We'd never had no time to go do a body count. You know

860
00:57:13.36 --> 00:57:18.72
that is you're just busy killing. Yeah. I don't want to throw that out. This all non-shall not like

861
00:57:18.72 --> 00:57:22.88
yeah. I know how that is. No, actually we never stacked up body so high that we lost count.

862
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.32
Going back to the book then an Air Force pilot and an F4 fan of a Rive Dawn station. Tell

863
00:57:30.32 --> 00:57:36.96
your people the ordinance will arrive on target before you hear me or the rounds. The pilot said.

864
00:57:36.96 --> 00:57:41.92
I told the team to put their heads down. The phenomenon of having bullets tearing into a target before

865
00:57:41.92 --> 00:57:46.32
anyone could hear the aircraft which delivered them was unbelievable. The jungle in front of us

866
00:57:46.32 --> 00:57:52.40
was shredded by the F4's gun run. Within a midnight or two his wingman dropped to 500 pound bombs.

867
00:57:52.40 --> 00:57:57.92
The change in aircraft staggered the NVA for a few moments. Right then in there I think the

868
00:57:57.92 --> 00:58:05.20
Lord for Uncle Sam's Air Force. The judge and the executioner rolled in right behind the fast mover.

869
00:58:05.20 --> 00:58:10.000
The judge's mini gun was real close to our perimeter. Seconds later the executioner followed

870
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.52
behind him firing several 2.75 millimeter rockets while his door gunners blasted away with their

871
00:58:15.52 --> 00:58:21.28
M60 machine guns because we hadn't expended any ordinance to our West. We ran the gun ships

872
00:58:21.28 --> 00:58:28.16
over the western edge of our perimeter. They drew no enemy fire either. About a half an hour before

873
00:58:28.16 --> 00:58:33.20
dusk spider told us the king bees were on their way. By that time the judge and the executioner

874
00:58:33.20 --> 00:58:39.04
had refueled, reloaded and were returning a few minutes in front of them. Everyone in STIdeho

875
00:58:39.04 --> 00:58:46.56
was dangerously low on ambient ammo, grenades and M79 rounds. So now you got the extract,

876
00:58:46.56 --> 00:58:53.28
platforms are coming back. The king bees are coming to get you. Before the king bees moved in

877
00:58:53.28 --> 00:58:57.68
an attempt to pick us up spider had the judge and the executioner made gun runs so close to our

878
00:58:57.68 --> 00:59:02.88
perimeter that we could hear the expended shell casings from the gun ships and 60 in miniguns falling

879
00:59:02.88 --> 00:59:09.28
to earth. Through all the excitement I told, walking that spider had spotted an area west of our

880
00:59:09.28 --> 00:59:15.44
perimeter where the king might be able to settle into some elephant grass for us. Walking in and

881
00:59:15.44 --> 00:59:20.88
hip passed the word to the team and we started moving toward the area from our location. We couldn't

882
00:59:20.88 --> 00:59:26.72
see the elephant grass and I had assumed we were locked into double a triple canopy jungle.

883
00:59:26.72 --> 00:59:32.08
Again the judge and executioner hammered our eastern flank as we moved toward the tentative

884
00:59:32.08 --> 00:59:39.84
LZ. So I got it. Or if you could explain spiders position a little bit because that's pretty unique

885
00:59:41.04 --> 00:59:47.60
to Vietnam of how those guys could be up overhead sort of watching and directing.

886
00:59:47.60 --> 00:59:54.56
Yeah they're we called in cubby the codename was cubby c o v e y but they were four air controllers

887
00:59:54.56 --> 01:00:03.44
basically and in the CNC mission you have an air force pilot at that time most of the cubby's

888
01:00:03.44 --> 01:00:13.60
were o 2s, says no 2, they had a push pool double engine but they always would have a prior

889
01:00:13.60 --> 01:00:18.88
one zero somebody with experience who'd been on a ground who would be with the air force pilot.

890
01:00:18.88 --> 01:00:25.20
So the pilot would fly then he would turn the radio over so to spider or whoever the cubby rider

891
01:00:25.20 --> 01:00:31.44
was. So that was a slot so sometimes the guys would be wounded they couldn't go to the field

892
01:00:31.44 --> 01:00:35.92
but they could fly cubby got it so that when we're on the ground we have a situation

893
01:00:35.92 --> 01:00:41.84
that we're dealing with then he's able to understand as opposed to talking to an air force pilot

894
01:00:41.84 --> 01:00:48.24
right who's just used to getting a bomb and drop it somewhere and talk about a contingent

895
01:00:48.24 --> 01:00:54.56
liability that's been off of a firefight and so that was a spider shop he was the cubby rider

896
01:00:55.20 --> 01:00:59.68
and then he and Pat Walkers that day were the two cubby riders that came in and they covered

897
01:00:59.68 --> 01:01:02.56
us until they got us out.

898
01:01:02.56 --> 01:01:12.08
Oh man, going back to the book, Salon Hipwear covered our frantic desperate drive to the chopper.

899
01:01:12.72 --> 01:01:16.96
After taking 10 minutes to cover those last 10 yards we reached the hovering king b

900
01:01:16.96 --> 01:01:23.04
which is about 8 feet above the ground. Fox set up an impromptu security watch on the western

901
01:01:23.04 --> 01:01:28.16
side of the road or wash. A quick check of my ammunition revealed I was down to one frag grenade,

902
01:01:28.16 --> 01:01:34.40
one white phosphorous grenade and two magazines of car 15 rounds. If I didn't get extracted that last

903
01:01:34.40 --> 01:01:40.56
frag grenade would be mine. There was no way in hell I was going to be a POW, especially after all

904
01:01:40.56 --> 01:01:48.96
the NVA ST Idaho and tack air had killed. If I had to use it I'd take as many NVA with me as I could.

905
01:01:48.96 --> 01:02:03.68
That's a bold statement. Oh yeah but by that time we knew about POW is what they go on through

906
01:02:04.72 --> 01:02:11.60
and we had lost a couple of guys and one of them had escaped and they were you know by now we're

907
01:02:11.60 --> 01:02:19.44
hearing the POW stories. So it's bad enough in country but for our mission. No, what's it going to happen?

908
01:02:19.44 --> 01:02:25.92
I figured it's just a sit. I'm just trying to take as many as we can. Make it a final contact.

909
01:02:28.24 --> 01:02:34.96
Now you guys eventually get to where you're loading the the king beast which again these are

910
01:02:34.96 --> 01:02:42.56
Vietnamese pilots. They're old aircrafts. Probably look like they were held together with

911
01:02:43.60 --> 01:02:49.52
duct tape. But they always had oil and fluids inside and so it's off you sat in too deep you get the

912
01:02:49.52 --> 01:02:57.28
fluid on your head. But we liked it better than the youy because they could take more hits

913
01:02:58.08 --> 01:03:04.32
and they had those old B-17 engines up front the nine rotary heads and they could take more

914
01:03:04.32 --> 01:03:09.44
hits and it's what we liked them. And this captain thin is I think he said thin.

915
01:03:09.44 --> 01:03:15.04
Captain thin. At some point during the craziness I looked up at the pilot of the king be captain tin.

916
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.28
He was above all the madness on the ground to completely calm and collected while his aircraft took

917
01:03:21.28 --> 01:03:26.000
numerous hits from enemy rounds. What made his demeanor all the more extraordinary was how it

918
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.36
contrasted with our adrenaline hype, frantic behavior on the ground. We had been fighting for hours.

919
01:03:31.36 --> 01:03:38.08
We were dirty. We were sweaty and we were exhausted. And their sat captain tin. Cool as a rocky mountain

920
01:03:38.08 --> 01:03:43.04
breeze. Giving the impression that it was just another milk run. It was as though he said no

921
01:03:43.04 --> 01:03:48.88
sweat boys I got all day. You just take your time. The students will break out the beverages after

922
01:03:48.88 --> 01:03:54.000
you've secured your seats. Looking at captain tin for a brief moment generated a mental image I

923
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.88
carried with me forever. Frankly I never understood how one man could be so steady under so much

924
01:03:58.88 --> 01:04:08.08
enemy fire and keep the chopper hovering. Can you imagine? It's as day I can't.

925
01:04:09.92 --> 01:04:13.76
Yeah and you go into a little bit further here. A day or two after the extraction.

926
01:04:13.76 --> 01:04:18.72
Captain tin and his crew came in to F.O.B. one's green beret lounge. I went in and thanked him

927
01:04:18.72 --> 01:04:23.52
again and ordered a couple rounds of drink for all the king be pilots and crew members.

928
01:04:23.52 --> 01:04:27.36
Speaking through an interpreter, Captain tin said the king be he flew to extract

929
01:04:27.36 --> 01:04:34.96
us from Echo 4 had 48 holes in it from enemy ordinance. Sitting at the bar, Captain tin appeared

930
01:04:34.96 --> 01:04:41.04
to be just as cool and above the fray of daily life as he had on seven October. Tin said that an

931
01:04:41.04 --> 01:04:46.000
enemy round had torn a baseball sized hole through one of the rotor blades. I asked him how he

932
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.52
could hover so long. He told me that when he piloted a helicopter he thought only about flying

933
01:04:51.52 --> 01:04:58.000
nothing else. No enemy bullets, weather or anything. Only flying. If it's my turn to die, I die.

934
01:04:58.72 --> 01:05:00.40
That day wasn't my turn to die.

935
01:05:04.64 --> 01:05:09.44
Amazing man. He's a he's an Arizona today. Really. He's still alive. Yeah. Oh.

936
01:05:10.48 --> 01:05:15.76
We'll be having him on the podcast. Hopefully you want to come on here. That's awesome.

937
01:05:15.76 --> 01:05:24.40
Uh, and then you had one of your guys and this is like the other on the spectrum. It's hard to

938
01:05:24.40 --> 01:05:28.88
maintain one of your guys Davidson had to talk to you when he came up and he said,

939
01:05:28.88 --> 01:05:33.28
I haven't mentioned that your nickname was tilt yet. Which get that nickname? Pinballs.

940
01:05:35.52 --> 01:05:40.48
See, when you play a pinball machine, you lose and walk away pissed off. When I lose, I shake the

941
01:05:40.48 --> 01:05:46.96
shit out of it. Get to see my nickname, Leon. Don't I leave? How did the SF guys know about that?

942
01:05:46.96 --> 01:05:50.88
How did they learn about it from us? It goes way back. Yeah. It was a kid. We said,

943
01:05:50.88 --> 01:05:54.88
I didn't even pinballs all the time. Little anger man has been issued. Indeed.

944
01:05:58.72 --> 01:06:04.40
So Davidson, he comes up tilt. I have to tell you something brother. I don't think I can do this.

945
01:06:04.40 --> 01:06:11.92
I survived back to brother, but I ain't seen I never seen shit like that before in my life.

946
01:06:12.32 --> 01:06:17.60
We were really lucky to survive that mission. I don't think I can go on. I hate to desert

947
01:06:17.60 --> 01:06:24.96
you brother, but I think I want off the team. Now I understood that look on his face from the previous

948
01:06:24.96 --> 01:06:30.08
day. I told Davidson that I respected his decision and that I appreciate his friendness.

949
01:06:30.08 --> 01:06:35.60
I thought it took more courage to be honest and camp than to not say anything and go in the field.

950
01:06:36.24 --> 01:06:42.40
A man unsure in the field could get other team members hurt. He reiterated that he

951
01:06:42.40 --> 01:06:49.04
performed well under fire in Echo 4. He hadn't run. He hadn't quit and he had demonstrated

952
01:06:49.04 --> 01:06:55.60
exemplary courage during the entire mission. As we walked and talked, I put my hand on the shoulder.

953
01:06:55.60 --> 01:07:01.84
James, you and I and walk and did something few men in America will ever do. We survived Echo 4

954
01:07:01.84 --> 01:07:07.68
and all the NVA could throw at us. There were six of us against hundreds of North Vietnamese

955
01:07:07.68 --> 01:07:14.24
finest. We will always have a special bond. Something no one can ever take away from us.

956
01:07:14.24 --> 01:07:19.52
Thanks again for your honesty. I asked him if he wanted me to talk to the sergeant major

957
01:07:19.52 --> 01:07:24.48
or did he want to do it? Because he had only been in camp a short while, he asked me if I wouldn't

958
01:07:24.48 --> 01:07:30.56
mind speaking to the sergeant major first. I agreed and asked him what sort of assignment he preferred.

959
01:07:31.44 --> 01:07:36.64
I don't know brother, I'll need some time to get my head straight. And you have a note in here

960
01:07:36.64 --> 01:07:44.000
32 years later, I talked to James Davidson and New Orleans on the telephone. One of the things he said

961
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:51.76
was brother I've never been the same since those two days and louss. Oh yeah, and he gave me

962
01:07:51.76 --> 01:07:59.28
back the captain 10 for a moment. The ethic pulled us out and we landed a food buy. I'd climb

963
01:07:59.28 --> 01:08:05.12
up the bank and say come on in and get you a drink. He goes, no my family is waiting for me. They're

964
01:08:05.12 --> 01:08:12.80
holding dinner. No, and even on that extraction that night because it's right at sunset. And so

965
01:08:12.80 --> 01:08:20.24
when we pulled out, it's one of those beautiful scenes where it's a dark green evergreen of the jungle.

966
01:08:20.24 --> 01:08:25.36
And all these little sparkling lights that are red with the green traces coming up. If I had

967
01:08:25.36 --> 01:08:29.28
had been traced it was just a beautiful scene but then you realize hey that's the NVA still trying

968
01:08:29.28 --> 01:08:36.64
to shoot our dumb ass down. But then we flew, he had a South directly for a few minutes. We had

969
01:08:36.64 --> 01:08:42.96
the sunset because that sweet sunset and was at that point that South looked at me and gave me that

970
01:08:42.96 --> 01:08:50.24
look. That's all it was. So we cut the mustard. So you know because when I first got in the camp,

971
01:08:51.04 --> 01:08:57.44
he looked at me. My came into it but it's better introduced me. He goes, he's too tall.

972
01:08:57.44 --> 01:09:04.08
His feet are too big and he looks stupid. It took me five months to get on his good side but we

973
01:09:04.08 --> 01:09:10.56
finally got there in Echo 4. All you had to do is just fend off a few hundred NVA together.

974
01:09:10.56 --> 01:09:16.80
Yeah, that's all it took. And so Davidson, so this was a volunteer to get into the program and you could

975
01:09:16.80 --> 01:09:23.12
add any points. Hey Tom, you can put. Oh yeah, absolutely. And no dishonor to it. Always preferred

976
01:09:23.12 --> 01:09:29.84
because like with Lynn Black in chapter six when they came up against 10,000, one of his Americans

977
01:09:29.84 --> 01:09:35.04
who was the son of a general who was just there to try and get some medals for himself. Never fired

978
01:09:35.04 --> 01:09:40.88
one round an anger and prayed during the entire day. What is facing the ground? The Vietnamese

979
01:09:40.88 --> 01:09:46.88
were ready to kill him. So that's kind of thing that you don't want. No, that's horrible.

980
01:09:49.60 --> 01:09:55.28
Yeah, these contacts that you're getting in, I just it's hard for me to get my head around.

981
01:09:55.84 --> 01:10:01.60
You're not to beat out there like a low-mic that with just really limited support, you know.

982
01:10:01.60 --> 01:10:08.32
Oh yeah, there are days, but we had Uncle Sans Air Force and those door gunners were great.

983
01:10:09.36 --> 01:10:12.72
Absolutely. And we had Scarface, you know, from the Marine Corps and we had different units

984
01:10:12.72 --> 01:10:18.40
of attached to us and we're just really lucky. Whenever we called the Aways Came and in fact we won

985
01:10:19.68 --> 01:10:26.24
Scarface it was Lieutenant Colonel Robinson. He pulled us out several times and he pulls out

986
01:10:26.24 --> 01:10:32.16
the one time. He got his plexiglass shot out, the bird shot up. We get us back to food. We chewed my

987
01:10:32.16 --> 01:10:37.28
asses every time we come to get you and he chewed my ass out. We go into the club. He's still chewed my

988
01:10:37.28 --> 01:10:44.32
ass out. I bought him drinks. Got him so drunk he couldn't walk. He had to fly. He's still chewed my

989
01:10:44.32 --> 01:10:48.56
ass out. I said Colonel, are you saying you're not going to come to the next time? I didn't say that

990
01:10:49.36 --> 01:10:54.16
every time you were hanging to Bell they came. But oh my God, they could really, they were

991
01:10:54.16 --> 01:10:58.96
tried the door gunners we get out of the helicopter. They were like the B or D models was really

992
01:10:58.96 --> 01:11:04.48
early U. E. So this is true with the muskets. The door gunners had to get out and kind of lift the

993
01:11:04.48 --> 01:11:08.96
helicopter as they tried to get enough power to get off the ground because they're just so loaded

994
01:11:08.96 --> 01:11:16.16
with ordinance than they jump in once they got moving. Quite a sight. But they always came.

995
01:11:16.16 --> 01:11:22.000
And the other thing is that's weird is they didn't really have night time capability. Not like

996
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:30.16
anyone. So well it seems like like now it is night is no factor for America. Oh I know we would have

997
01:11:30.16 --> 01:11:36.72
been over our mother for one of those dogs. Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah. But for you guys once the

998
01:11:36.72 --> 01:11:43.84
sun went down it was hard to get picked up. It was hard to call for fire. It seemed that way. Oh yeah.

999
01:11:44.96 --> 01:11:48.80
No doubt. And then you were racing the sun. You were racing the sun. You were racing the

1000
01:11:48.80 --> 01:11:54.24
nature. Oh yeah, she's a key player between a weather and the sun said. Yeah, that's the other

1001
01:11:54.24 --> 01:11:58.48
scary thing. I don't mean you see, you know this is something I usually say early on but I haven't

1002
01:11:58.48 --> 01:12:04.08
said yet. I'm reading tiny excerpts of this book. So if you're listening to the podcast,

1003
01:12:05.12 --> 01:12:11.68
these are tiny excerpts. This is less than five less than 3% of this book. This book is filled

1004
01:12:11.68 --> 01:12:16.56
with this kind of mayhem. So you have to get the book to appreciate it. Well I'm just kind of

1005
01:12:16.56 --> 01:12:22.24
hitting some of the highlights. But yeah, the fact that you guys were racing against the sun going

1006
01:12:22.24 --> 01:12:27.28
down and how the sun goes down. Okay, cool. Where did we go to that mean? In modern-day

1007
01:12:27.28 --> 01:12:33.04
sealtimes for me, that means we use a night strobe, an infrared strobe that the enemy can't

1008
01:12:33.04 --> 01:12:38.08
see instead of a marking panel. What does it mean for you? It means another another 12 hours out

1009
01:12:38.08 --> 01:12:44.08
in the bush because you're not getting picked up. I just hope that the the lions leave you alone.

1010
01:12:44.08 --> 01:12:55.44
You know, let me to tigers. You had this one idea or you know, the group had an idea of dropping

1011
01:12:55.44 --> 01:13:01.76
like a big giant daisy cutter. But a bit bomb like a 2000 pound bomb in order in areas that were

1012
01:13:01.76 --> 01:13:07.76
so packed with vegetation that you couldn't get in helicopter and they're like, oh, we got

1013
01:13:07.76 --> 01:13:12.08
a night. It will just drop a big bomb and it was going land in there. Yeah. Get dropped off in there.

1014
01:13:12.08 --> 01:13:19.52
And so this one operation where you're doing that, you're heading into the jungle. You're going

1015
01:13:19.52 --> 01:13:24.80
to one of these things where you dropped 2000 pound daisy cutter bomb. You're repelling, you're the

1016
01:13:24.80 --> 01:13:30.56
number one man heading down. Right. And you decide that, like, hey, this is an abort situation.

1017
01:13:30.56 --> 01:13:34.72
I think you saw some enemy. Oh, yeah. And so you decide, okay, let's abort this thing. And here

1018
01:13:34.72 --> 01:13:38.64
we're going to the book. As I looked up, I was glad to see King, who's one of your team members

1019
01:13:38.64 --> 01:13:44.32
climbing back into the King Bay. I got on the radio and told Kovey to abort the mission as we had

1020
01:13:44.32 --> 01:13:49.12
been compromised again for a few fleeting moments I'd consider trying to get the team on the ground.

1021
01:13:49.12 --> 01:13:53.20
Frankly, I was sick and tired of getting shot out of LZs and I wanted to run a mission instead of

1022
01:13:53.20 --> 01:13:58.24
going through the gut wrenching firefight on the LZs, which is, you know, again, I'm skipping around

1023
01:13:58.24 --> 01:14:03.12
this book. But you would do mission after mission where you guys would try and land. You get shot off the

1024
01:14:03.12 --> 01:14:12.56
LZ. Oh, yeah. That would be the primary secondary and then the alternate LCs. So you try three

1025
01:14:12.56 --> 01:14:17.04
insertions. You know, I'm just going to, I'm just going to, for the record, if I go one insertion

1026
01:14:17.04 --> 01:14:24.08
and I get shot off, I'm coming home. I'm coming home. We're going to go on the road. I'm not going

1027
01:14:24.08 --> 01:14:28.40
to go to the secondary. And if I get shot off the secondary, I'm damn sure not going to the

1028
01:14:28.40 --> 01:14:31.36
tertiary. I think I'm going to get away with it. I'm going to go back and come up with a new plan.

1029
01:14:31.36 --> 01:14:37.52
Well, by then, the King be running out on the gas. They had to go back. So you're there.

1030
01:14:38.32 --> 01:14:42.56
Then I saw the helmet of an NVA soldier heading toward the Bomb area. He was approaching from the

1031
01:14:42.56 --> 01:14:47.20
area where I heard the first voice from the jungle area in front of the helicopter, which was

1032
01:14:47.20 --> 01:14:51.36
up the hill from where I was on the ground. As soon as I saw my open fire with my car 15,

1033
01:14:51.36 --> 01:14:57.28
suddenly the King be swirled away leaving me on the ground. Suddenly it was eerily quiet, then it hit

1034
01:14:57.28 --> 01:15:02.80
me. I was standing in the middle of a smoking LZ in the middle of Louss. And I was alone. All of a sudden

1035
01:15:02.80 --> 01:15:08.000
I felt small, very small. The trees that had survived the Bomb blast were tall. The jungles

1036
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:14.56
around in the LZ was both impressive and formidable and not somewhere I wanted to travel by myself.

1037
01:15:14.56 --> 01:15:19.92
I tried to raise Kavion the radio. There was no answer from Watkins. Even though I was the American

1038
01:15:19.92 --> 01:15:24.56
teen leader on ST Idaho, I insisted on carrying the radio because I wanted to be the person calling

1039
01:15:24.56 --> 01:15:29.20
air strikes around my team. The Vietnamese kept surviving the field and I felt my end of surviving

1040
01:15:29.20 --> 01:15:33.76
the jungle warfare was to direct tax to the air strikes and helicopter gunships to the enemy.

1041
01:15:36.16 --> 01:15:41.12
So the King be comes back. So you're there. The King be comes back. Captain Tuan.

1042
01:15:41.12 --> 01:15:47.76
Drap drops a rope down to you for you to clip into because it's I guess too tight for it to land

1043
01:15:47.76 --> 01:15:50.72
or it doesn't want to land because it's going to take a bunch of time and energy. So they just

1044
01:15:50.72 --> 01:15:54.08
throw you a rope. Yeah, they can't land because there are too many tree stumps.

1045
01:15:54.08 --> 01:16:01.60
They're easy carding and everything down. And at that time we were just refining the tactic

1046
01:16:01.60 --> 01:16:06.000
of using rope extractions. So for anyone that's listening right now,

1047
01:16:08.24 --> 01:16:15.04
when you're refining tactics, try and do it on training operations. What we did, we trained

1048
01:16:15.04 --> 01:16:22.32
first. We had 150 foot rope, we'll sand back to it and then I had a D ring on the end and be 150

1049
01:16:22.32 --> 01:16:27.20
foot rope and so they had to have a sand back so we'll get through the jungle to get to the ground to you.

1050
01:16:28.08 --> 01:16:32.80
And we had developed other tactics but you had a D ring on your chest. Well, you're going to get to that.

1051
01:16:32.80 --> 01:16:37.84
Yeah, yeah. But so yeah, here we go. I saw no NVA but the weapon that was being fired at the

1052
01:16:37.84 --> 01:16:42.000
unmistakable bark for an AK 47. I fired another M79 round in that direction.

1053
01:16:43.20 --> 01:16:47.92
That round's explosion must have startled Captain Tuan because he jerked the King be upward

1054
01:16:47.92 --> 01:16:52.48
yanking me off the ground before I could slip the D ring on my left shoulder around the rope.

1055
01:16:52.48 --> 01:16:57.28
That shoulder D ring was critical for staying in the Swiss seat. We had heard horror stories about the

1056
01:16:57.28 --> 01:17:04.08
body, desecrations and the NVA had performed on Sogman and I didn't want that happening to me.

1057
01:17:04.08 --> 01:17:09.84
As Tuan lifted me into the air, I opened fire with my car 15 on what appeared to be a muzzle flash

1058
01:17:09.84 --> 01:17:15.76
coming from the hilltop area. So you're getting hoisted up by the helicopter while you're

1059
01:17:15.76 --> 01:17:20.96
returning fire and slipping out of your D ring. Yeah, then quite get hooked in, because at that

1060
01:17:20.96 --> 01:17:25.84
as we got a little higher up, I was ricocheting off the trees. I was I was a human pinball for a few

1061
01:17:25.84 --> 01:17:35.04
men's here. Tilt. There we go. Then I became scared. So then you decided to become scared. Okay,

1062
01:17:35.04 --> 01:17:41.84
that's fine. I still hadn't hooked my shoulder D ring and someone fired a few green tracers at us.

1063
01:17:41.84 --> 01:17:45.76
Captain Tuan started to pull out of the target area. As he started gaining speed, I ricocheted off

1064
01:17:45.76 --> 01:17:49.76
a few trees before I cleared the jungle. Having sat in the Kingby's copilot seat, I understood

1065
01:17:49.76 --> 01:17:53.92
why he pulled away from the LZ before I'd cleared the trees. If the chopper gets shot down,

1066
01:17:53.92 --> 01:17:58.64
the mission turns into an operational light mirror while potentially injuring or killing the crew

1067
01:17:58.64 --> 01:18:03.68
and the recon team members aboard the ship. I wasn't angry with him hell. He came back for me.

1068
01:18:03.68 --> 01:18:08.40
I would have been stranded down here for at least two more hours before other choppers with ropes

1069
01:18:08.40 --> 01:18:13.28
could have been able to extract me if he hadn't. But being dragged through the trees hurt,

1070
01:18:13.28 --> 01:18:18.56
I was angry myself for not getting the damn D ring hooked before I lifted off the ground. My arms

1071
01:18:18.56 --> 01:18:23.20
were getting very sore. As I went to switch arms, I was struck by some sort of air pocket and

1072
01:18:23.20 --> 01:18:31.84
suddenly I was upside down at 5,000 feet. My only physical length of life was the D ring hooked

1073
01:18:31.84 --> 01:18:37.76
into my rope seat and the 150 foot piece of rope hanging from the helicopter. I twisted my body

1074
01:18:37.76 --> 01:18:41.60
to look up at King again. Thank God he was still hanging out the door. I signal to get the

1075
01:18:41.60 --> 01:18:47.60
chopper to land. As I was giving King signs, I felt the rope slipping down my thighs to my knees.

1076
01:18:47.92 --> 01:18:52.08
At the same time, my web gear was sliding from my hips over my stomach toward my neck. And

1077
01:18:52.08 --> 01:18:57.04
a matter of moments the Swiss seat was at my knees. The only way I stopped it from moving further

1078
01:18:57.04 --> 01:19:03.92
was by spreading my legs. I felt really stupid. After all the training, this was going to be a

1079
01:19:03.92 --> 01:19:09.36
dumb way to die. As the ropes slid across my feet, I knew I was moments away from passing out.

1080
01:19:09.36 --> 01:19:14.24
There was no way I could keep my legs spread just before the end. Several brief scenes from my

1081
01:19:14.24 --> 01:19:20.000
life flashed through my mind. Dolores, my kindergarten sweetheart, why did she move to California?

1082
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.92
I saw my dad's new 1949 Chevrolet milk truck with its dark evergreen paint with the white

1083
01:19:25.92 --> 01:19:32.08
side panels and rich gold leaf letters. My red wagon from childhood high school football games.

1084
01:19:32.08 --> 01:19:38.40
And to add insult to injury, I saw the front page article in my hometown part paper about my death.

1085
01:19:38.40 --> 01:19:44.40
The story was below the fold because stories about local boys dying in nom were now commonplace.

1086
01:19:44.40 --> 01:19:50.88
That angered me because my family would never know where I really died. On the other hand,

1087
01:19:50.88 --> 01:19:56.16
I didn't want them to know how I really died. Just as I started to pass out, I felt the rope

1088
01:19:56.16 --> 01:20:03.52
slip off my feet. My body went limp. I vaguely remember hitting the elephant grass before landing

1089
01:20:03.52 --> 01:20:10.96
hard on my back on the ground. I had fallen only 10 or 20 feet. The elephant grass cushioned the fall.

1090
01:20:10.96 --> 01:20:15.28
I hadn't realized that Captain Twong had the aircraft descending during those last

1091
01:20:15.28 --> 01:20:27.12
frantic moments. Had those legs spread like a New York City hooker?

1092
01:20:27.12 --> 01:20:34.88
Yeah, that's a nightmare. King came out and picked me up and threw me in the

1093
01:20:34.88 --> 01:20:42.48
chopper left on my gear there. So my car 15 and my sawed knife, which now would be a highly treasured item,

1094
01:20:42.48 --> 01:20:48.80
still in Leos. Oh, you lost it a lot. He just pulled the open a web gear and he had to get

1095
01:20:48.80 --> 01:20:54.96
to think off my neck, the rucksack, the web gear. He pulled it off and just picked me up and

1096
01:20:54.96 --> 01:21:00.32
threw me in the helicopter. I was really happy to feel my head bounce off that metal floor. It hurt,

1097
01:21:00.32 --> 01:21:08.56
but it was a happy hurt. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah again, if you have to get this book because

1098
01:21:08.56 --> 01:21:13.44
I'm trying to pick some good stories, but these are just the kind of ridiculous

1099
01:21:15.28 --> 01:21:19.20
things that are going on. Just another day in the song. Just another day in the song.

1100
01:21:19.20 --> 01:21:24.16
Getting hung upside down, 5000 feet above enemy territory by a D-ring.

1101
01:21:28.88 --> 01:21:34.08
Another one here. You guys got some bad weather. You're got no support overhead.

1102
01:21:34.08 --> 01:21:39.12
That's another thing people need to understand is, because of where you guys were located,

1103
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.92
at a pretty good distance away from the bases, if there was no aircraft overhead,

1104
01:21:46.32 --> 01:21:50.32
then you wouldn't be able to communicate with anyone because they would use line to site.

1105
01:21:50.32 --> 01:21:54.72
Now, do you guys carry every carry HF radios to try and make long distance? We had VHS for

1106
01:21:54.72 --> 01:22:02.32
our UHF. Yeah, the York 10 was at. But at nights, during the day there was always an airborne

1107
01:22:02.32 --> 01:22:10.56
command aircraft up. So at the daytime was Hillsboro, code at night, it was moombeen. So they

1108
01:22:10.56 --> 01:22:15.12
would check in with us on our frequency. So you would no matter what, you'd have some

1109
01:22:15.12 --> 01:22:19.20
full of cops. Okay, that's good to hear. And so because of the, we knew the NVA

1110
01:22:20.24 --> 01:22:26.08
RDF radial direction finder was really good. They were sharp on that. So when they would

1111
01:22:26.08 --> 01:22:31.92
check in with us again, it would be just a click-click. No discussion. And Fuzzy, you don't know

1112
01:22:31.92 --> 01:22:36.32
the direct radio direction finding. So if you sit there and talk on the radio for a long period

1113
01:22:36.32 --> 01:22:42.48
of time, the enemy can actually capture those transmissions. They're trying to make a useful

1114
01:22:42.48 --> 01:22:45.36
multiple stations and they can tell what direction they're coming from and they can try and

1115
01:22:45.36 --> 01:22:51.12
get where you're at and they can come and get you. So for this particular one, you guys are

1116
01:22:51.12 --> 01:22:56.000
the weather's bad. So you don't have any, you don't have any actual direct support overhead.

1117
01:22:56.56 --> 01:23:00.56
The, the NVA had been just the, what is the one where you got? You try to set up an ambush

1118
01:23:00.56 --> 01:23:04.64
and they told you don't do it. Well, we had the ambush set up. We'd been there. But then they told

1119
01:23:04.64 --> 01:23:08.56
you don't execute the ambush, right? They don't execute it because we were had visions of,

1120
01:23:08.56 --> 01:23:14.80
we get the POW because the nut day, if you, we caressed a live POW. Five day R&R, anywhere in the

1121
01:23:14.80 --> 01:23:22.000
world, $100 bonus. Like, man, we're talking about, we're the plank and plans Hawaii or Australia.

1122
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.36
We hadn't quite decided. And as spider came back over and I gave him the code, we got a POW

1123
01:23:27.36 --> 01:23:32.96
it would be back at the primary LZ and one hour. And that's where he said, don't move. Yeah.

1124
01:23:32.96 --> 01:23:36.88
But you hadn't initiated. You didn't have the POW. No, yeah, you were waiting. Oh, yeah, they're

1125
01:23:36.88 --> 01:23:40.72
walked up and down a trail. Yeah, it was just a matter of time before you were going to, well, we

1126
01:23:40.72 --> 01:23:44.88
spring your ambush. And this is one of those deals where we violate the order rules of recon.

1127
01:23:44.88 --> 01:23:50.48
Not only we go 10 and 10, walk 10 minutes, pause 10 to hear the jungle, let the jungle,

1128
01:23:51.20 --> 01:23:57.04
see how it's gone. Well, this one, because we had so much trouble trying to get in, they had

1129
01:23:57.04 --> 01:24:02.000
slashed in burn areas that were underneath the jungle canopy. I divided the team. We had to

1130
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:08.32
eight man team this time. But for each side, and I said, we're going to go up this hill until we get

1131
01:24:08.32 --> 01:24:14.72
to an area to a trail or whatever. And we didn't stop. We went really hard. Maybe 20, 30, 40 minutes

1132
01:24:14.72 --> 01:24:21.04
I forget now. We came up to a big trail. We crossed it one at a time. Covered our tracks.

1133
01:24:21.04 --> 01:24:26.72
Got things that up, South put up the wire tap, had a perfect ambush. You know, we had trained

1134
01:24:27.92 --> 01:24:36.64
limb black had developed the the ambush kilzone so that we had clay mors that would go across.

1135
01:24:37.20 --> 01:24:43.52
But in the center there'd be a six foot area that there'd be no strappin' on. But we had,

1136
01:24:43.52 --> 01:24:48.88
he he practiced on himself and see for it. So he finally figured out at the certain length

1137
01:24:48.88 --> 01:24:53.92
what a stick of C4 was. We didn't knock yourself out. He did literally. Yeah. I know this is another

1138
01:24:53.92 --> 01:25:00.96
enter. Oh yeah. So that's our input. But we had a lot set up. So we had C4 to knock out one person,

1139
01:25:00.96 --> 01:25:06.32
clay mors to kill everybody else with sides, parameters, and one in the rear just in case he

1140
01:25:06.32 --> 01:25:11.44
came down to mountain on us. And they're diddy popping up down the trail. We could have had officers,

1141
01:25:12.08 --> 01:25:16.64
they're walking down the trail. Nobody said upset because we had gone so far so fast

1142
01:25:16.64 --> 01:25:22.16
violating all of our rules that the people up to hill didn't know what was going on down the hill.

1143
01:25:23.12 --> 01:25:28.72
And then Spiders says don't move. I was like, that's what things that really ugly.

1144
01:25:29.44 --> 01:25:33.36
And when he, what was the reason why he told you guys no to do it? Because the weather was moving in.

1145
01:25:33.36 --> 01:25:38.40
Oh yeah. They certainly have been on the ground two or three hours. And the weather sucked.

1146
01:25:38.40 --> 01:25:43.84
And he's at 10,000 feet. I can't even see the mountain, let alone C and L's. So he's saying,

1147
01:25:43.84 --> 01:25:47.76
look, we're not going to be able to get you out of there right now. Just don't do what

1148
01:25:47.76 --> 01:25:53.68
we're going to do and and and break contact in a way. Yeah. So you guys are kind of kind of on the run.

1149
01:25:53.68 --> 01:25:58.08
You guys start moving out of there. Right. And so about that time up the hill, we hear the tanks

1150
01:25:58.08 --> 01:26:03.28
and other trucks starting up their engines. And all of a sudden the activity on the trail

1151
01:26:03.28 --> 01:26:08.56
goes from casual to frantic. Now everybody's two with me guys. They all got their AKs.

1152
01:26:08.56 --> 01:26:11.92
What do you think could have been that you were there? Well, they heard us come in.

1153
01:26:11.92 --> 01:26:16.56
And by then we could hear the dogs. They have some dogs that were deaf back on the L.C.

1154
01:26:17.12 --> 01:26:22.96
So they had started looking for us officially. So when you hear dogs, tanks, trucks,

1155
01:26:22.96 --> 01:26:28.48
I mean a bunch of people with AK 47's. Yeah. How do you feel about that?

1156
01:26:33.76 --> 01:26:38.24
The Pucker Factor is mine is zero. It really is. It's like, oh my God.

1157
01:26:38.24 --> 01:26:44.40
And you know that you've got no form of extraction. Correct. The weird thing is I guess and

1158
01:26:44.40 --> 01:26:48.72
having worked in the jungle a little bit, you know, I spent some time in the jungle in South

1159
01:26:48.72 --> 01:26:54.16
America in the Southeast Asia. Like I will say this, the jungle is huge. Right. And you could see

1160
01:26:54.16 --> 01:27:00.24
we're okay. I can get I can make myself scarce at least until you remember they got trackers. Right.

1161
01:27:00.24 --> 01:27:06.40
And they got dogs. Lots of them. So you're in that situation here. Yeah.

1162
01:27:06.40 --> 01:27:10.96
Another Thursday night. But would you get them? We did get the wiretap though.

1163
01:27:10.96 --> 01:27:14.64
South had run their wiretap. I worked for an hour. So once you want you guys had to take the

1164
01:27:14.64 --> 01:27:20.000
tape recorder with you though. Oh yeah, we carried the little, you know, you think about the traditional

1165
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.36
early old cassette recorder. So I had like two or four of the chip of a deep

1166
01:27:27.36 --> 01:27:35.44
bad reason. And then we had the microphone that had little plug in in and then South would run

1167
01:27:35.44 --> 01:27:40.96
up the tree or fly up the telephone pole. In this case, he'd gone up when he came back down and put

1168
01:27:40.96 --> 01:27:45.68
mud on the whole thing. So anybody going by on the trail looked at the pole they wouldn't see

1169
01:27:45.68 --> 01:27:53.36
in. And so we ran it for over an hour. We had run that wiretap and it flipped the cassette over because

1170
01:27:53.36 --> 01:28:00.80
that was steady. Are the times sets. I think that's where you were. You're now stuck down. Now you

1171
01:28:00.80 --> 01:28:05.36
can't even move in pull back all the clay amorous to see for which direction did you had.

1172
01:28:06.72 --> 01:28:11.68
Did you go away from where you inserted or did you go back to where you were. We went, no,

1173
01:28:11.68 --> 01:28:19.20
we went away from it. If I'm facing ELZ, we went to our left. We had to go, we crossed that big

1174
01:28:19.20 --> 01:28:24.32
trail again. But this time we had a cross it in between and it became up and down. The truck

1175
01:28:24.32 --> 01:28:30.96
went past us and so took us a while to get back across the big trail because this trail again,

1176
01:28:30.96 --> 01:28:36.80
this is LALZ. By the way, this is a slightly more T-min trail. The Ho Chi Montreal. Spiders that

1177
01:28:36.80 --> 01:28:41.36
even when he could see the jungle, he couldn't see that road and the road was big enough. You could

1178
01:28:41.36 --> 01:28:50.80
drive tanks down a side by side. It's huge. It would be the equivalent of Highway 78 or 52

1179
01:28:50.80 --> 01:28:57.28
two lanes. So tanks side by side but it's completely covered by the covered by the vegetation.

1180
01:28:57.28 --> 01:29:02.08
So took us a while to get across the road. Then we went to the left and we finally came to a

1181
01:29:02.08 --> 01:29:06.72
little stream bed and went up that stream because now it's dark. But now we hear more dogs.

1182
01:29:07.36 --> 01:29:12.80
The activity on the trail, another couple of trascobines, all those noise we noted looking.

1183
01:29:13.76 --> 01:29:19.84
And eventually you're holding up and you stop. Right. And on the way up that stream, we put out

1184
01:29:19.84 --> 01:29:26.80
pepper. We put out the mace to throw off the dogs. We had our team go up and down. He's a little

1185
01:29:26.80 --> 01:29:32.72
because it's about 10 foot tall bank. We're in this little creek or stream. He had water in it.

1186
01:29:33.52 --> 01:29:38.32
And so we're trying to lose the dogs. We knew they're coming at night. And now it's dark.

1187
01:29:38.32 --> 01:29:42.64
And we continued up that stream for a while. I wanted to get it far away from them as we could.

1188
01:29:43.36 --> 01:29:47.60
Because Salah climbed a tree and said they're coming. He pointed out he told he had

1189
01:29:47.60 --> 01:29:52.88
there are hundreds of them coming with lights. They all had lanterns and the dogs were getting closer.

1190
01:29:54.08 --> 01:29:58.40
So we could chain up that stream for another hour to at night. Doing still going out,

1191
01:29:58.40 --> 01:30:01.76
putting down the mace to me. Fines went up to the bank on the right.

1192
01:30:02.48 --> 01:30:06.40
Set up our RON for the night. Rest overnight. And I'm facing the bank.

1193
01:30:07.20 --> 01:30:13.28
And the other seven guys are around. And so again, we hear the dogs, the people.

1194
01:30:13.28 --> 01:30:20.48
So we're there in the RON for maybe two or three hours. Two guys come up. The stream with a lantern.

1195
01:30:21.44 --> 01:30:27.12
Burning brightly. They go past this. Lenten goes out and they come back as a compact,

1196
01:30:27.12 --> 01:30:32.32
hept, coughs. And then they stopped. And I think that's where you're going next.

1197
01:30:33.12 --> 01:30:38.96
Well, yeah, here it is. One of the NVA and the creek started crawling up the embankment toward me.

1198
01:30:38.96 --> 01:30:45.76
I was still facing the creek. The NVA soldier was good. He only moved when the wind stirred the trees.

1199
01:30:46.48 --> 01:30:51.44
For a moment, my thoughts drifted to summer camp and new hampsure years earlier. When we played

1200
01:30:51.44 --> 01:30:56.48
capture the flag on those clear summer nights, my favorite trick was to use the woods to get his

1201
01:30:56.48 --> 01:31:02.08
close to the flag as possible. Now, my mind was racing a hundred miles per hour and I realized I was

1202
01:31:02.08 --> 01:31:10.64
the flag and he was closing in. He was too close for me to tell anyone on my team. The jungle that

1203
01:31:10.64 --> 01:31:16.08
might seem deadly quiet except of course when the wind stirred. As the NVA soldier crawled closer,

1204
01:31:16.08 --> 01:31:22.64
I remembered thinking that my heart was beating so damn loud that Ho Chi Minh could hear it in

1205
01:31:22.64 --> 01:31:29.28
Hanoi. I flashed back to my childhood when we used to play high and go seek on West Paul Avenue

1206
01:31:29.28 --> 01:31:33.44
and Trent New Jersey. One of my favorite hiding places was behind the hedges and missed him.

1207
01:31:33.44 --> 01:31:39.36
And Mrs. Amigos front yard. I remember worrying that Teddy's a brow ski or John Wayne Austin

1208
01:31:39.36 --> 01:31:44.40
or Worc, Barbara Pointen would find me because they could hear my heart beating so loud.

1209
01:31:45.28 --> 01:31:49.12
I tried to comfort myself by thinking that because I had not been running in recent hours,

1210
01:31:49.12 --> 01:31:53.92
my heart beating shouldn't be too loud. Yet my heart sounded like a kettle drum during Beethoven's

1211
01:31:53.92 --> 01:32:00.72
ninth. No matter the NVA soldier kept moving up the embagament. I was very impressed with this stealth.

1212
01:32:00.72 --> 01:32:07.04
I could barely hear him. Then it happened during one windy moment. I heard movement very close to

1213
01:32:07.04 --> 01:32:14.64
me. It was only a slight sound but a sound nonetheless before the wind stopped the NVA soldier

1214
01:32:14.64 --> 01:32:22.56
touched the soul of my size 10 R Army Issue Jungle Boot. I heard it's like gas was surprised

1215
01:32:22.56 --> 01:32:28.64
from him. At that moment I had a death grip on my car 15. I had it on single shot. A car 15 on

1216
01:32:28.64 --> 01:32:33.60
full automatic sounds much different from the bark of an AK47 on full automatic. If I had to shoot

1217
01:32:33.60 --> 01:32:39.44
it would be single shots. For a millisecond I wondered if my left foot was far enough to the left

1218
01:32:39.44 --> 01:32:45.68
so that when I fired it I wouldn't shoot myself. Time stood still. My pocket factor was minus zero.

1219
01:32:46.88 --> 01:32:51.52
After a few of the longest seconds of my life the wind stirred but there was no movement.

1220
01:32:51.52 --> 01:32:57.92
He remained still. After what seemed like an eternity the wind stirred again and I heard the NVA

1221
01:32:57.92 --> 01:33:03.92
move backward just slightly. He was so cool. I knew he was facing me. I wondered why I couldn't

1222
01:33:03.92 --> 01:33:14.56
hear his heart. The jungle around us remained pitch black. That was my twilight song moment.

1223
01:33:14.56 --> 01:33:26.72
Yeah. That's craziness. You think he decided like this guy's probably got the drop on me

1224
01:33:26.72 --> 01:33:31.36
and I want to live. What do you think he decided? I believe so because there had been any other

1225
01:33:31.36 --> 01:33:38.72
movement at all. Then he would have been on the receiving end of the 556. He made a tactical decision

1226
01:33:38.72 --> 01:33:46.16
to live. Then obviously once you started shooting the gig's up and you would have been people

1227
01:33:46.16 --> 01:33:50.48
on your trail clothes. And had to happen. I thought was if I just did one single shot could the

1228
01:33:50.48 --> 01:33:55.28
muscle flash would light up where he was and then I would just hope it would take no more than

1229
01:33:55.28 --> 01:34:01.36
a second shot to finish them off. So that the jungle they would hear gunshots but they wouldn't

1230
01:34:01.36 --> 01:34:07.52
be quite sure where. Was this and people that haven't spent time out in the woods or out in the

1231
01:34:07.52 --> 01:34:14.16
jungle. It can get completely pitch black in the jungle. Is that what this was? Was this just

1232
01:34:14.16 --> 01:34:17.60
like completely like he's you could barely even could you see his face at all? Nothing.

1233
01:34:17.60 --> 01:34:21.84
He's like new he was there. You sit there and you can feel your hand in front of your nose when

1234
01:34:21.84 --> 01:34:25.84
you shake and move it back and forth. You can feel the breeze from your hand but you can't see it.

1235
01:34:25.84 --> 01:34:31.04
Yeah. So for those of you that haven't been in this it's when you get at night time and then

1236
01:34:31.04 --> 01:34:37.04
it's a cloudy night and then you're in triple canopy jungle. There is no light. You can't see anything.

1237
01:34:37.04 --> 01:34:46.24
And that's what this situation is. Absolutely. Well luckily you you you got out of that and then

1238
01:34:46.24 --> 01:34:51.20
you guys continue on going back to the book by nine o'clock we had located the LZ and secured it

1239
01:34:51.20 --> 01:34:56.56
at the clear area at several feet of grass on it and the ground was at an angle because it was on

1240
01:34:56.56 --> 01:35:02.80
the side of the mountain again we heard dogs. Our tactical scenario stunk. We were in a relatively

1241
01:35:02.80 --> 01:35:09.20
open area on a hillside with minimal cover and the NVA had the high ground. Time seemed to be our worst

1242
01:35:09.20 --> 01:35:15.20
enemy although having limited airs air resources didn't prove our mood. Finally the other team

1243
01:35:15.20 --> 01:35:20.48
was extracted without taking further casualties and spider was overhead taking ground fire

1244
01:35:20.48 --> 01:35:27.92
from the north of the LZ. He told the trustee and reliable Marine Corps UH1B gunships with the radio

1245
01:35:27.92 --> 01:35:34.64
call sign Scarface were seconds away. As we heard the choppers approaching us one of the tow

1246
01:35:34.64 --> 01:35:40.72
poppers that sound suned planted exploded. So you guys were doing that too. You guys said booby traps

1247
01:35:40.72 --> 01:35:48.40
on them on the enemy set claimors on them. Right. Which would really piss them off. Oh yeah.

1248
01:35:50.80 --> 01:35:56.16
Try to ruin their parade. Yeah. We knew the NVA were going to be hopping mad now. That's an

1249
01:35:56.16 --> 01:36:01.28
gentle way of putting it. Spider was able to vector the Scarface gunship to our location quickly.

1250
01:36:01.28 --> 01:36:05.52
There was no time for orientations. We pop smoke and seconds later. The first Scarface chopper

1251
01:36:05.52 --> 01:36:10.56
roared in. The jungle north of us erupted with small arms fire. The second Scarface chopper roared

1252
01:36:10.56 --> 01:36:14.80
in so close to. I could see the facial expressions on the door gunners. He blasted the area north

1253
01:36:14.80 --> 01:36:20.16
of our LZ with his M60 machine gun. Both Scarface both Scarface aircraft took several hits.

1254
01:36:20.72 --> 01:36:24.96
When the sky raiders made their passes they also took hits from small arms fire that sounded like

1255
01:36:24.96 --> 01:36:31.52
AK-47s. During the second gun run, Sal Blue a claim or in the face of an NVA scout. Sal then

1256
01:36:31.52 --> 01:36:35.84
blew a second claim or returned to the LZ reporting more NVA troops right behind him.

1257
01:36:37.12 --> 01:36:40.16
And you guys this is another interesting SOP and we would do this too.

1258
01:36:40.80 --> 01:36:46.08
Carry claimors. I didn't do the I own the rephrase. We would we got trained to do this. You know,

1259
01:36:46.08 --> 01:36:50.56
you know, jungle situation. Right. You guys would make claimors with like five second and 10

1260
01:36:50.56 --> 01:37:00.16
second fuses on him. Boom put him down pull the fuse. Yeah, and run. I never used to one of those.

1261
01:37:01.92 --> 01:37:09.68
I'm very thankful that I did not. Yeah. Yeah. Apparently the combination of

1262
01:37:09.68 --> 01:37:14.32
air assets and our 40 millimeter barrage is slow the NVA troops long enough for the extra action

1263
01:37:14.32 --> 01:37:19.20
ships to come to the LZ. Spiderman told me that the 101st airborne division was going to extract us.

1264
01:37:19.20 --> 01:37:24.72
The Marine Corps gunships would make one more gun run and for the first time ST Idaho

1265
01:37:24.72 --> 01:37:29.12
slicks from the 101st airborne division would follow right behind them and get us close to the LZ

1266
01:37:29.12 --> 01:37:33.44
as possible. We were used to the Kingbees and new most of the pilots on a first name basis. The

1267
01:37:33.44 --> 01:37:38.24
101st pilots were good too. But because this was our first time with the 101st airborne division

1268
01:37:38.24 --> 01:37:42.88
slicks, I told Sean King that they had to be the first people to approach the ship and that they

1269
01:37:42.88 --> 01:37:48.40
had to alert the young doorgunners that that five of our men were Vietnamese. That's a crazy

1270
01:37:48.40 --> 01:37:53.04
thing to think about. Absolutely. So you got that we had horrible results when they were

1271
01:37:53.04 --> 01:37:58.64
careful. And again, young doorgunners for sure coming to country and if they're not

1272
01:37:58.64 --> 01:38:04.96
briefed properly because our guys dressed their reggly, they're not that they would look like

1273
01:38:04.96 --> 01:38:10.72
NVA but they weren't Americans. And we've had team members that lost Vietnamese that way. Yeah,

1274
01:38:10.72 --> 01:38:17.60
tragically. When Roger Hade was on, he told a story of the same thing. He had Vietnamese scouts

1275
01:38:17.60 --> 01:38:22.24
and they were doing a hammer and anvil operation with a platoon they had to work with before that

1276
01:38:22.24 --> 01:38:27.20
was new in country. And there were some mix-up, it was on the insertion and you know, just some

1277
01:38:27.20 --> 01:38:33.52
mistakes that compounded. And anyways, these guys, the the Anvil portion was waiting and the first

1278
01:38:33.52 --> 01:38:38.96
guys that came out of the tree line were their Vietnamese scouts. Yeah, and they got they got lit up.

1279
01:38:38.96 --> 01:38:48.48
You know, we were in when I was in Ramadi, you know, you see like picture of seals with like

1280
01:38:48.48 --> 01:38:54.96
beards and all that and they're gonna go like, everyone shaved and everyone, we were regular uniforms

1281
01:38:54.96 --> 01:39:00.48
what the army and what the Marine Corps wore. Why? Because that exact reason, you know, you

1282
01:39:00.48 --> 01:39:06.80
swing around a corner and you've got a 19-year-old on a 50-cal and he sees some guy with a beard and

1283
01:39:06.80 --> 01:39:11.28
a gun, there's a chance you're getting shot. Whereas an American, you know, because the geodists would

1284
01:39:11.28 --> 01:39:17.68
have beards, right? And in Ramadi we just didn't, everything we could do to identify ourselves as

1285
01:39:17.68 --> 01:39:24.32
good guys, right? And your geoders could have everything from M-16s for car beans to AKs. You didn't know

1286
01:39:24.32 --> 01:39:30.40
what they'd be carrying it. Yeah, and they also will be new, our guys had AKs or SKSs. Yeah,

1287
01:39:30.40 --> 01:39:37.76
the other thing was they wore paramilitary outfits. Right. So they wore camis, they wore body armor

1288
01:39:37.76 --> 01:39:44.40
sometime, they wore helmets sometimes. So yeah, that's amazing that you guys, and also you had the

1289
01:39:44.40 --> 01:39:49.12
you had the cognizance to say, hey, wait a second, we've never worked with these helicopters before

1290
01:39:49.92 --> 01:39:54.40
get out there and tell them we got some Vietnamese folks coming their way with AK 47s. Yeah,

1291
01:39:54.40 --> 01:39:59.04
they're a piss because when King went down to the first chopper, nobody else followed and I said,

1292
01:39:59.04 --> 01:40:03.20
you make sure you tell them, then you give me the green light, then we'll send some people,

1293
01:40:03.20 --> 01:40:07.84
and then Bubba and I got on the second next track. And there's two of the things on that mission.

1294
01:40:07.84 --> 01:40:14.56
Yeah. King had experimental pump M79, which he carried it, helped five rounds, and we

1295
01:40:14.56 --> 01:40:19.04
we thought we tried once, but he carried it for five days, well, that for whole five days we were on

1296
01:40:19.04 --> 01:40:26.32
the ground. And so at that LZ it worked. And imagine five M79 rounds go off to 40 millimeters.

1297
01:40:26.32 --> 01:40:33.44
Then also one night was the night that the Russians flew over us and did a resupply, and we were

1298
01:40:33.44 --> 01:40:38.40
begging for Moonbeam to show up and get somebody on it, Russian has. But the whole side of

1299
01:40:38.40 --> 01:40:42.72
the mountain that was a weirdest damn thing we ever saw. So that was like a signaling device for

1300
01:40:42.72 --> 01:40:48.72
that was signaling devices that the Vietnamese were using to have the Russians drop the resupply

1301
01:40:48.72 --> 01:40:57.28
and they were doing resupplies to the Vietnamese. What language did you speak? My foreign language is English.

1302
01:40:57.28 --> 01:41:03.36
So they pushed us through and they weighed the language requirement because by 68 they knew we had

1303
01:41:03.36 --> 01:41:09.04
a SF had a strong interpreter core. God it. Like like, he spoke four languages, he had been

1304
01:41:09.04 --> 01:41:15.68
educated in France and he cracked up my English. And he was a smart ass on top of it. A little

1305
01:41:15.68 --> 01:41:24.16
fucker. But he was our little guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Awesome. Going back to the book, the

1306
01:41:24.16 --> 01:41:30.08
extraction was slick and quick. When as we pulled out of the automatic, as we pulled out the LZ,

1307
01:41:30.40 --> 01:41:35.60
the slick took several hits. Three of us returned full automatic fire from our car 15s. I threw

1308
01:41:35.60 --> 01:41:41.44
a white phosphorus grenade as the area north of the LZ lit up with dozens of muzzle flashes from

1309
01:41:41.44 --> 01:41:48.08
AK 47s and SKSs. The green traces from the AK 47s appeared as though they were coming between my legs.

1310
01:41:48.08 --> 01:41:54.40
I was told later that as our slick pulled out of the LZ, the escarface gunship laid down a full

1311
01:41:54.40 --> 01:42:01.28
fuselage fuselage of suppressing fire. The lead marine aircraft piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Robinson

1312
01:42:01.28 --> 01:42:06.72
had the plexiglass windshield blown out of the aircraft. In addition, his chopper in the second

1313
01:42:06.72 --> 01:42:13.92
gunship had taken more than a dozen hits. And yeah, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the,

1314
01:42:13.92 --> 01:42:18.80
yes, but you were saying, yes, he was riding you and riding you. Oh, yeah, the way you tell

1315
01:42:18.80 --> 01:42:23.20
the book. Colonel does this mean the next time we're in trouble. And we call for Scarface. You

1316
01:42:23.20 --> 01:42:29.20
won't respond to the bell. Hell no Robinson responded. I never said that. It just pisses me off with my

1317
01:42:29.20 --> 01:42:40.08
aircraft gets shot up. Parts are hard to come by and I'd rather be flying. Fearless. And you know,

1318
01:42:41.04 --> 01:42:44.88
you continue on here. I went back to my room. So this is after that crazy operation. You

1319
01:42:44.88 --> 01:42:51.44
clearly make it out for the hundredth time that you, you, you dance in death's face. I went

1320
01:42:51.44 --> 01:42:55.44
back to my room and picked up a news magazine with a picture on the front page about the biggest

1321
01:42:55.44 --> 01:43:02.08
latest antiwar protest say side in saying who side were they on? They hadn't seen Charlie,

1322
01:43:02.08 --> 01:43:09.60
like ST Idaho head. They never, they never asked South, hip, and other Vietnamese men on my team,

1323
01:43:09.60 --> 01:43:16.08
what they felt about the war. What a day. S3 refused to pull us out when we were ready for extraction.

1324
01:43:16.08 --> 01:43:21.84
Then S3 questioned my integrity despite the fact that we were only minutes away from fighting NVA

1325
01:43:21.84 --> 01:43:28.08
in close quarters. Battle had not scar face the AE1Es and the hundred first airborne

1326
01:43:28.08 --> 01:43:33.12
slick defended us from the sky. And there are people back in the states protesting this war.

1327
01:43:33.12 --> 01:43:38.24
I shook my head, dropped my rucksack and web gear, picked up a small ammo belt holding several

1328
01:43:38.24 --> 01:43:44.24
magazines of 556 ammo and went to the S3 to get a Jeep. The dentist was only a short drive up the

1329
01:43:44.24 --> 01:43:49.68
road, but I kept my trusty car 15 year by anyway. I went to the dentist, got my tooth pulled

1330
01:43:49.68 --> 01:43:57.28
and drew new rations and PRC 25 batteries. And the reason I read all that is to read this line right here.

1331
01:43:57.28 --> 01:44:03.68
The next day, the next day, ST Idaho got shot out of 5 LZs.

1332
01:44:03.68 --> 01:44:10.80
Yeah, once the morning and once the new afternoon. But at that time when we got inserted on that

1333
01:44:10.80 --> 01:44:16.48
mission error, we had gone on a couple days of the same thing. The morning gets shot out.

1334
01:44:16.48 --> 01:44:22.96
And on one of those missions on the primary LZ, when the king bee was going in,

1335
01:44:24.72 --> 01:44:34.08
sal, saw a wire across the LZ. How does sal even see a wire in the helicopter when we're going in?

1336
01:44:34.88 --> 01:44:40.40
He saw it. He told the door gunner. Fortunately, the via the meest thing was quick and they were able

1337
01:44:40.40 --> 01:44:48.32
to swore of away. And the A1 came in and hit that. There was a 500 pound bomb. They knew we were coming

1338
01:44:48.32 --> 01:44:52.88
and we had been compromised. We never realized how seriously we had been compromised. And that was

1339
01:44:52.88 --> 01:45:00.24
proof. Hard proof. And our guys, so Tara, I switched a lot of the via the meest around.

1340
01:45:01.44 --> 01:45:05.68
So your guys were some of your via the meest were getting burned out. Oh sure. Because you know

1341
01:45:05.68 --> 01:45:11.52
you do that long flight, go out through the LZ, then you go in and get shot out, shot out,

1342
01:45:11.52 --> 01:45:16.40
shot out, fly back, get lunch, get a new target. Sometimes they just say, here's your next target.

1343
01:45:16.40 --> 01:45:20.40
Cubby would know where it would be. Be wouldn't even have any kind of background or anything

1344
01:45:20.40 --> 01:45:24.96
on it. Just they wanted to get a team on the ground. Go back and then we did it again. Bam,

1345
01:45:24.96 --> 01:45:32.24
bam, bam, bam. And sometimes when you and Sarah, you're feeding me, sometimes Sarah, I had enough of

1346
01:45:32.24 --> 01:45:36.32
the school's your main, whose your main, South of the South, South by counterpart. He was the

1347
01:45:36.32 --> 01:45:40.56
assistant team leader. He is the Vietnamese team leader. And who was the other American that would be

1348
01:45:40.56 --> 01:45:46.48
with you? At that point in time was Bubba, John Schur. He came on the team and the Vemba when I

1349
01:45:46.48 --> 01:45:51.04
became to 1-0 at the end of October. And these guys were all freaked out too because you were like

1350
01:45:51.04 --> 01:45:58.48
young. Oh yeah. And what were you? Was your rank at that time? Well by then I've been promoted to

1351
01:45:58.48 --> 01:46:04.64
an E4 because I remember I like the promoted. Yeah. I'm an E-Doo's in camp with the bill for

1352
01:46:04.64 --> 01:46:10.80
E8 or E9 on the recon team. So Spiderman probably got me promoted back to PFCs and now roll up

1353
01:46:10.80 --> 01:46:15.44
your sleeves so people think you're a sergeant. We don't want them knowing you're just a dumb ass PFC.

1354
01:46:17.84 --> 01:46:25.92
Instead of bi October, we were able to, I respect for and then when Jim wanted to

1355
01:46:25.92 --> 01:46:30.72
off the team which we respected and to this day I respected. Never I'll never say a word against them

1356
01:46:30.72 --> 01:46:38.40
on that. Then Bubba came on. So in November that's when Bubba, he was the one one and then

1357
01:46:38.40 --> 01:46:43.28
on that one mission. King came along. I just felt funny about I want to look extra firepower.

1358
01:46:43.28 --> 01:46:49.44
He wanted to try that pump M79. Yeah, why not just go on a mission to test out that there.

1359
01:46:49.44 --> 01:46:56.96
Yeah. We had that they sent us some thermal barric grenades for the M79.

1360
01:46:57.52 --> 01:47:05.28
Really? Yeah. And then they called a week later and said, hey, did you guys get a chance?

1361
01:47:05.28 --> 01:47:10.40
It was actually late. I think late dumped like an entire loadout on one operation.

1362
01:47:11.28 --> 01:47:14.88
And anyway, they call back this, hey did you guys want to? If you can a chance to use those

1363
01:47:14.88 --> 01:47:20.24
thermonic thermonic grenades, you're like, we use them all. Send more. Yeah, that's the feedback.

1364
01:47:21.84 --> 01:47:27.60
Do not wait. Oh, yeah, and also as I speak of that as one of our side missions,

1365
01:47:28.80 --> 01:47:34.64
we always carried out the sun or Italian green, which would be enemy ordinance,

1366
01:47:34.64 --> 01:47:40.08
doctor took splotin or face. So when we were going along a trail like with that big trail,

1367
01:47:40.08 --> 01:47:44.56
we crossed it. We go down and dump a little bit of the ammo. So if anybody was see the ammo,

1368
01:47:44.56 --> 01:47:50.64
they pick it up. And then if we ever came across a cashier, which only happened a few times,

1369
01:47:50.64 --> 01:47:56.32
we would put the bad ammo in their cashier. So they'd use it for siops, then it would blow up in their face.

1370
01:47:57.60 --> 01:48:03.44
Yeah, that was a good siops thing when they, there was another mission where you talk about

1371
01:48:03.44 --> 01:48:08.08
where they killed the Americans, but they let the interview to me, let's go. That was their January 1,

1372
01:48:08.08 --> 01:48:18.88
69. All right, speaking of holiday season. Here's Christmas day, 1968. You're inserted into like

1373
01:48:18.88 --> 01:48:25.04
some really tall elephant grass. There's NVA around you. Going back to the book,

1374
01:48:25.04 --> 01:48:29.44
due to the elephant grass, both in terms of the noise, we were making how muffled, how it muffled

1375
01:48:29.44 --> 01:48:33.52
our other sounds. We couldn't have exactly how many NVA were moving or if they were even NVA.

1376
01:48:33.52 --> 01:48:40.24
Black said, I smell smoke, either our hand grenades or the NVA have started fires.

1377
01:48:41.52 --> 01:48:47.60
Things are really heating up on the LZ literally. I radioed spider. I told him we were surrounded and

1378
01:48:47.60 --> 01:48:53.12
had fires on two sides of our perimeter. I told him that if the King bees didn't get in here,

1379
01:48:53.12 --> 01:48:58.64
ASAP, ST Idaho would be engaged in fighting fires as well as fire fights.

1380
01:48:58.64 --> 01:49:07.20
What's really making these funny jokes in the middle of these situations? Sometimes you have to

1381
01:49:07.20 --> 01:49:14.16
laugh to keep in cry. They're starting more fires, Bubba said. By now the noise from the fire forces

1382
01:49:14.16 --> 01:49:17.60
to raise our voices when we were talking to each other, the smoke was getting thicker. I began to

1383
01:49:17.60 --> 01:49:21.44
sweat. We threw a few more hand grenades down the hill to force the NVA to keep their heads down.

1384
01:49:22.16 --> 01:49:26.88
The southern fire, so just so everyone understands this is what's actually happening. You're in elephant

1385
01:49:26.88 --> 01:49:34.56
grass, dry elephant grass, and it's burning on multiple sides of your position, which is 12 to 15 feet tall.

1386
01:49:35.76 --> 01:49:40.80
The elephant grass. So your visibility is like five feet, three feet? Yeah, minimal.

1387
01:49:43.12 --> 01:49:49.28
And it's filled with smoke. Yeah. And getting worse over. We wish you a merry Christmas.

1388
01:49:50.32 --> 01:49:54.72
The southern fires intensity grew by the second and continued to move up the slope towards

1389
01:49:54.72 --> 01:50:00.96
us and around to the east. There was fire or fires to the north and northeast, but they weren't

1390
01:50:00.96 --> 01:50:04.64
heading toward ST Idaho with the speed of the southern flames.

1391
01:50:05.76 --> 01:50:11.20
By now the smoke was so thick. I had my green crevat over my face and pulled up over my nose,

1392
01:50:11.20 --> 01:50:16.88
burning embers from the south, kicked up and flew over our small jagged perimeter, dumping ashes,

1393
01:50:16.88 --> 01:50:22.08
sweat, and small burning sparks on the elephant grass and on us. When the hip and twan were

1394
01:50:22.08 --> 01:50:28.48
hats, several of us soaked our hair. Black told me that the NVA weren't far behind the flames.

1395
01:50:28.48 --> 01:50:33.60
Twan had reported seeing images of short distance behind the flames to the south and southeast.

1396
01:50:33.60 --> 01:50:39.44
Captain Twan knew exactly where we were, as he brought the H34 down the canyon toward us.

1397
01:50:40.24 --> 01:50:46.24
Seconds became ours. My vision was clearer than ever, and I was a completely aware of the smoke fire,

1398
01:50:46.24 --> 01:50:52.56
popping sounds and enemy gunfire. I stood on the western edge of the perimeter, waving a

1399
01:50:52.56 --> 01:50:58.88
colored panel skyward trying to catch the pilot's eye. The H34 continued its slow motion descent.

1400
01:50:58.88 --> 01:51:03.52
All I saw was the bottom of the chopper with the front of the struts sticking out to the right

1401
01:51:03.52 --> 01:51:09.12
and left coming down like a giant praying mantis. The rotor wash from the king be began to hit us.

1402
01:51:09.12 --> 01:51:13.04
Finally the choppers know's turned slightly to the left and I could see Captain Twan.

1403
01:51:13.04 --> 01:51:18.16
Seeing his face, seeing him sitting in there so calmly in the pilot's seat, made my

1404
01:51:18.16 --> 01:51:27.20
confident surge. We would survive. You guys get around, get it under control.

1405
01:51:27.20 --> 01:51:30.96
Under control as you can, you start boarding the chopper. Chopper is the last man board of the

1406
01:51:30.96 --> 01:51:35.76
chopper. I signal to the door going to the exit area. As I sat in the door, I sat in the door as

1407
01:51:35.76 --> 01:51:39.92
Huang lifted the king be straight up for several feet before heading south. As we pulled away from

1408
01:51:39.92 --> 01:51:45.92
the null, fire swept up the hill and engulf the area where we had been standing moments earlier.

1409
01:51:48.16 --> 01:51:51.60
Oh yeah. Have you Christmas up pause?

1410
01:51:56.40 --> 01:52:02.56
Captain Twan roared down the canyon. We had chugged only a short while ago. I radioed Spider and

1411
01:52:02.56 --> 01:52:08.96
gave him a team okay. Once again, ST Idaho entered that magical post-mission moment.

1412
01:52:08.96 --> 01:52:12.72
The adrenaline was still flowing. We had survived another target.

1413
01:52:14.16 --> 01:52:21.36
Every breath of air was sweeter. There was no thought of Christmas, mom or holiday presence.

1414
01:52:23.20 --> 01:52:34.32
Our gift was to be alive. That Christmas 1968 would haunt me sporadically for more than 25 years

1415
01:52:34.32 --> 01:52:39.28
after a while. I was able to stop sitting upright, sweating with fear when the nightmares hit.

1416
01:52:40.32 --> 01:52:46.000
It's been almost 10 years since I had that dream. But every Christmas nightmare is or not. I always

1417
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:53.92
take a moment to think of Captain Twan's courage. No sweat. King bees never rest.

1418
01:52:53.92 --> 01:53:05.44
Yeah. So that's just a crazy situation.

1419
01:53:05.44 --> 01:53:10.72
Oh yeah. Close. And then this is like on Thanksgiving was when we had a mission down south.

1420
01:53:11.28 --> 01:53:18.000
We were a six-man recon team. The Colonel tells us you have to find three missing NVA divisions.

1421
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.72
The first, the third and the seventh. We found them. How did that work out for you?

1422
01:53:22.72 --> 01:53:26.16
It was pretty intensely used. We used more than one of those five second fuses.

1423
01:53:26.16 --> 01:53:33.60
The whole back. Yeah. That's why you need to buy this book and read this book if you want to hear

1424
01:53:33.60 --> 01:53:40.16
about the eight-man spike team versus a division. That day was three. Three divisions.

1425
01:53:40.96 --> 01:53:45.36
For those of you that don't know what I mean, that's 30,000 men roughly.

1426
01:53:45.36 --> 01:53:53.12
Yeah. That's where those five second fuses. Those five second fuses. Just so everybody understands

1427
01:53:53.12 --> 01:53:58.000
what that means. You're trying to escape the enemy. Have a little thing called a clay more mine.

1428
01:53:58.56 --> 01:54:01.04
It's like the size of a book, maybe a little bit bigger.

1429
01:54:03.04 --> 01:54:08.80
It's kind of bunch of ball bearings on one side. 550. 550 ball bearings on one side.

1430
01:54:08.80 --> 01:54:17.20
That spray out when this thing explodes. So they wound people. How many of those things did you

1431
01:54:17.20 --> 01:54:25.84
guys carry? Everybody had one on the team and then the one one or the other two or three.

1432
01:54:25.84 --> 01:54:31.52
So you guys have to see four. Yeah. And so what these guys would do? So you can use them for a

1433
01:54:31.52 --> 01:54:35.36
bunch of different reasons. And one of the things that you guys did a lot with them. And this is again,

1434
01:54:35.36 --> 01:54:39.44
these are things that I was trained in when I was first got to the seal teams. They do. Okay. When you

1435
01:54:39.44 --> 01:54:43.68
set up a, when you're going to sleep at night or you're going to set up a rest overnight position,

1436
01:54:43.68 --> 01:54:47.20
you're going to put out claymores. And that way if you get attacked in the middle of night, boom,

1437
01:54:47.20 --> 01:54:51.52
you can light off the claymores and you can get some fire superiority or at least shock the

1438
01:54:51.52 --> 01:54:56.08
enemy or do some damage to them. So you guys did that all the time. But then you made these little

1439
01:54:56.08 --> 01:55:02.24
five second fuses knowing that if you're running away, you can just put this thing up,

1440
01:55:02.24 --> 01:55:06.48
you know, put it in the ground real quick or put it up against the tree. Well, yeah, you always want to have it

1441
01:55:06.48 --> 01:55:10.48
up against the tree or something to take the back. But back then even when you put it in,

1442
01:55:10.48 --> 01:55:14.88
and you got the last four seconds before it explodes, you're running and you could still,

1443
01:55:14.88 --> 01:55:20.64
you want to make sure that you got a little protest on the black blast. We used to detonate those

1444
01:55:20.64 --> 01:55:27.36
things that are completely unsafe distance behind them. I, like I look back now and I'm thinking

1445
01:55:27.36 --> 01:55:33.68
what we're doing. WTF times. Yeah. Yeah. It's like let, we, we'd play the game. Let's find out.

1446
01:55:35.92 --> 01:55:41.28
Are you relate the limb blocks? Yeah. Yeah. So you started to tell that story a little bit. For those

1447
01:55:41.28 --> 01:55:45.68
that didn't catch the whole story, the story was, Lynn Black was trying to figure out what it would

1448
01:55:45.68 --> 01:55:52.24
take to knock somebody out with C4. So C4 has six feet. Yeah. C4 just explodes. There's no

1449
01:55:52.24 --> 01:55:56.72
shrapnel in it. You can put shrapnel in it, but you don't have to. So it's just, it's just a big

1450
01:55:56.72 --> 01:56:03.52
concussion. So Lynn Black was trying to figure out how much C4 it would take so we can stun a guy

1451
01:56:03.52 --> 01:56:08.72
so we can grab them so we can get a P.O.W so that we can get a five day liberty anywhere in the

1452
01:56:08.72 --> 01:56:16.000
world anywhere and $100 cash. And so he, so the way he, the way he experimented with this

1453
01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.20
was by doing it to himself. Yeah. Just standing around at the range and blasting himself with

1454
01:56:21.20 --> 01:56:26.08
heavier heavier weight until he got knocked out. And when he finally succeeded, he, uh, his hearing

1455
01:56:26.08 --> 01:56:31.92
was bad for a few days. Yeah. This air was all. So you know, I was really, I don't know if this,

1456
01:56:31.92 --> 01:56:35.84
in the seal teams, that would have been, we would have used a new guy for that. We would

1457
01:56:35.84 --> 01:56:42.000
use the new guy like, okay, let's see if this works. I'll do, let's win the stun guns, the tasers

1458
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.72
first came in. Right. It wasn't fun to be a new guy because we had to see how those things work, right?

1459
01:56:46.72 --> 01:56:55.84
So we, uh, we used to experiment that. So, um, yeah, that's, that story is just crazy and you,

1460
01:56:55.84 --> 01:57:00.88
and you looking down and seeing the firing, golf, the place that you just got picked out. Oh yeah,

1461
01:57:00.88 --> 01:57:07.76
instantly. Sure, is this like one of those moments in time? It was the same thing like on

1462
01:57:07.76 --> 01:57:11.76
Thanksgiving Day, we got distracted. They were coming out of the jungle running at Port Arms

1463
01:57:11.76 --> 01:57:16.88
and so they would be trying to come down. So being the door gunner would just literally stop them

1464
01:57:16.88 --> 01:57:20.000
and they're trying to like, one of those cartoons you see on the TV with the guys running and

1465
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.48
stops and gets a joke. They would just push them right back in the jungle before they even fell down.

1466
01:57:25.68 --> 01:57:30.16
And that was just, yeah, you just, you don't forget those things. They stick with you.

1467
01:57:32.88 --> 01:57:35.92
The next chapter is called a happy new year. Oh.

1468
01:57:35.92 --> 01:57:45.04
Well, uh, the day after Christmas, the S3 brass asked ST Idaho to run another MA target in

1469
01:57:45.04 --> 01:57:50.24
Louss. I respectfully declined signing fatigue in general, wearing this. I didn't tell the

1470
01:57:50.24 --> 01:57:54.56
brass that I had a funny feeling about the target. I felt apprehensive for some reason.

1471
01:57:56.16 --> 01:58:01.76
Back at FOB 1 around 1200 hours, someone from the commoshack came into the club instead of

1472
01:58:01.76 --> 01:58:08.40
Vietnamese team member from RT Aspsis on the radio talking to Spiderman. That was very bad news.

1473
01:58:09.36 --> 01:58:14.32
Several of the recon team members in FOB 1 headed toward the commoshack before we got there.

1474
01:58:14.32 --> 01:58:19.04
Tony Horell of Veteran Recon Man came around the corner with some more bad news.

1475
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:25.52
They were hit by sappers. It doesn't look good. It appeared the Americans and been slow to react

1476
01:58:25.52 --> 01:58:30.56
in a matter of seconds. The sappers killed the three SF troops and chose to leave the South

1477
01:58:30.56 --> 01:58:38.40
Vietnamese team members alive. The news about the sappers was a triple dose of bad news. First,

1478
01:58:38.40 --> 01:58:46.56
we had three dead green berets. Second, reports, one zeroes had received for months about NVA

1479
01:58:46.56 --> 01:58:54.40
sappers being a lethal force were now confirmed. Third, by killing only the Americans, the NVA

1480
01:58:54.40 --> 01:59:00.72
pulled off a major psychological coup. By leaving the Vietnamese team members alive,

1481
01:59:00.72 --> 01:59:07.92
their survival would plant seeds of doubt and dissension between SF troops and our little people.

1482
01:59:15.36 --> 01:59:20.64
And then you guys were heading north. The 101st Airborne Division choppers carried the six men's

1483
01:59:20.64 --> 01:59:26.48
south. When the choppers landed on the helicopter pad, Colonel Jack Warren had ordered every man

1484
01:59:26.48 --> 01:59:33.68
in FOB 4 out to the site. He was held in high regard by SF troops because he genuinely cared

1485
01:59:33.68 --> 01:59:39.92
about his men. It had been said that because of his dedication to the SF mission and the men

1486
01:59:39.92 --> 01:59:46.56
of SF, he would never advance beyond the rank of Colonel. He'd remained in SF too long, a career

1487
01:59:46.56 --> 01:59:55.44
decision that the traditional Army hierarchy despised and punished. Asp was from FOB 4, FOB 4,

1488
01:59:55.44 --> 02:00:02.40
which Warren commanded. After the three corpses were unloaded from the helicopter, Warren gave

1489
02:00:02.40 --> 02:00:09.44
a turse, tear-eyed speech to his captive audience. Warren warned everyone that if they were careless

1490
02:00:09.44 --> 02:00:16.56
in the field, death was the result of that carelessness. Then he bent down, opened a body bag,

1491
02:00:16.56 --> 02:00:23.84
and picked up a portion of a body of one of the dead Americans. He was now crying and screaming

1492
02:00:23.84 --> 02:00:33.52
at his men to never be careless in the field. Warren was never the same after that. Neither was C&C.

1493
02:00:33.52 --> 02:00:41.28
What was it that changed from your perspective?

1494
02:00:41.28 --> 02:00:50.80
Well, from early briefings, probably in October, we heard about the N&VA sapper teams. They were

1495
02:00:50.80 --> 02:01:02.24
highly trained, and they were just where a loincloth, carrier weapon, and they were really just

1496
02:01:02.24 --> 02:01:08.000
highly trained in tracking. So when they came to the attack part, they had minimal clothing,

1497
02:01:08.64 --> 02:01:14.48
and they knew what they were looking for. The N&VA at that point had a metal, kill American metal.

1498
02:01:15.12 --> 02:01:19.44
So they killed us, they got their metal and a bonus, and there would be heroes for the rest of

1499
02:01:19.44 --> 02:01:28.24
the lives within the Communist Party. So we heard about them, and it just kicked up everybody's

1500
02:01:28.24 --> 02:01:35.60
concerned about it. And that being New Year's Eve, the team had that the Americans had

1501
02:01:36.16 --> 02:01:41.28
taken a bottle of Scotch with them, so they had a little hit of the Scotch, we don't know how much.

1502
02:01:41.28 --> 02:01:46.40
And that's what Jack Warren had going to extra distance on saying about being careless, we don't know.

1503
02:01:46.40 --> 02:01:53.20
But those sappers were good, and that proved it and it just gave us an arcase.

1504
02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:00.72
No, as you know, if you do your R&M that night, without the dogs, he would do your perimeter,

1505
02:02:00.72 --> 02:02:05.28
and our people always checked to me, and we always had rotated who's sleeping, who wouldn't,

1506
02:02:06.16 --> 02:02:11.20
and we never ever had a problem with that. No matter how tired you are, there'd be somebody

1507
02:02:11.20 --> 02:02:16.40
awake just so something like that happened, somebody'd be there on full automatic ready to respond.

1508
02:02:18.96 --> 02:02:25.36
New level terror. Yeah, and those guys were so, they just traveling super light and super

1509
02:02:25.36 --> 02:02:31.20
select the sappers. Sure. You know, just could move quickly and that's a scarier.

1510
02:02:31.20 --> 02:02:37.68
Yeah, because you know, we knew that the NVA had all our sources set up, besides being compromised

1511
02:02:37.68 --> 02:02:42.48
in headquarters, they also had people that alerted when the choppers left the long site.

1512
02:02:43.12 --> 02:02:48.72
They had border watchers so that when we came in, they would report where we were heading

1513
02:02:49.44 --> 02:02:55.68
to a higher command, and they would try to rally their troops. So we were up against that at all times,

1514
02:02:55.68 --> 02:03:00.48
just a question of who would be there, how many? And a lot of times, just getting on the ground,

1515
02:03:00.48 --> 02:03:06.56
was the first part, but then you hoped to get into the mission, and it was just really a challenge.

1516
02:03:13.04 --> 02:03:17.04
Speaking of a challenge, you were going back to the book, the daily grind of running missions

1517
02:03:17.04 --> 02:03:23.92
across the fence was wearing on me physically and mentally. As 69 dawned, I began a mental

1518
02:03:23.92 --> 02:03:31.28
examination of life in Saga, being in an elite unit within America's finest special operations

1519
02:03:31.28 --> 02:03:38.08
was where I wanted to be. The adrenaline enhanced high of deadly firefights against a relentless

1520
02:03:38.08 --> 02:03:47.20
enemy under extremely lopsided odds was intoxicating. I had never experienced such exileration or sheer

1521
02:03:47.20 --> 02:03:54.08
terror. Yet there was a little voice in the back of my head which spoke of survival. Surviving

1522
02:03:54.08 --> 02:03:59.44
not only of vigorous enemy campaign directed against the Saga members, but merely surviving the

1523
02:03:59.44 --> 02:04:08.96
odds of going home in one piece. My mind also began the mental debate between rising to the new

1524
02:04:08.96 --> 02:04:15.84
challenges inherent in a secret war and returning to a safer assignment. My one-year tour of

1525
02:04:15.84 --> 02:04:22.40
duty was scheduled to end at the end of April. Under the general rules of Saga after running targets

1526
02:04:22.40 --> 02:04:28.08
across the fence for six months, I could request a cushy assignment. I'd already spent seven

1527
02:04:28.08 --> 02:04:37.04
months with the team. I was alive, however thanks to hip, sal, fuck, taunt, and the other man of

1528
02:04:37.04 --> 02:04:50.96
STI-Doh. I couldn't just walk away. That's where you wrap up this book. You go into some cool,

1529
02:04:53.84 --> 02:05:00.16
one more really interesting story and then you also have a very cool thing in there about what

1530
02:05:00.16 --> 02:05:06.000
you guys carried. What we didn't carry. And what you didn't carry. So how much longer? So now it's

1531
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:12.40
January of 69. You've been there for seven months. How much longer did you stay with the C and C teams?

1532
02:05:12.40 --> 02:05:19.04
I'll stay right there to the end. We closed F will be one in January. They shipped us down to the

1533
02:05:19.04 --> 02:05:27.76
Nang and that's where I picked up with the second book and they needed help down there. So we hit the

1534
02:05:27.76 --> 02:05:36.08
ground, continued to run. Bubba asked the team to take an off the team. So he left, limb black came on.

1535
02:05:36.08 --> 02:05:42.64
So was linen on for my last couple months and at the very end they had a mission up at the

1536
02:05:42.64 --> 02:05:50.32
Mugia Pass which was north of the DMZ River in Leos which was a major channel point.

1537
02:05:50.32 --> 02:05:57.76
And the plan was for us to go in, set up on a mountain top, taking a lot of clay mowers,

1538
02:05:57.76 --> 02:06:05.60
mortars and calling air strikes for two or three days on that just the race held with the NVA there.

1539
02:06:05.60 --> 02:06:13.28
Because they never had a recon team go that far north. And we did an inspection which is that

1540
02:06:13.28 --> 02:06:21.28
inspection prior to that mission which was about April 20, 69. And then we finally went up to the

1541
02:06:21.28 --> 02:06:28.40
launch site and we were up there. I guess maybe about the 24th or 25th I just figured these

1542
02:06:28.40 --> 02:06:33.28
act date now but we went up to the launch site. Got on the chopper as we get ready to launch the chopper's

1543
02:06:33.28 --> 02:06:41.12
take off and they turned around with back. That target had just had two aircraft shot down over it.

1544
02:06:41.12 --> 02:06:47.04
They figured they just shot down a fanton jet and the sky reader. Chopper's going to be easy to knock out

1545
02:06:47.04 --> 02:06:54.08
the sky. So the sideboard to that, I met a beginning two years ago. One of the guys at Rambeacon

1546
02:06:54.72 --> 02:06:59.52
says, remember those pictures you got on the your second book on the ground there I said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1547
02:07:00.24 --> 02:07:05.36
He says, what was that mission? Wasn't that something like that's a suicide mission right?

1548
02:07:05.36 --> 02:07:08.80
He says, well, I don't know about suicide. It was going to be high odds but you know,

1549
02:07:08.80 --> 02:07:16.24
we were gone and we had two extra Americans. We had M60s. We got Buku Bullets, Hangrines. We were

1550
02:07:16.24 --> 02:07:22.16
going to give the shot. Guy goes, do you realize they asked me to do that and I told him to

1551
02:07:22.16 --> 02:07:27.92
fuck off? I go, really? I said, you saw his technique picture. You didn't tell me that.

1552
02:07:28.96 --> 02:07:34.40
So I didn't know what your mission was. So here's a top secret operation. The recon guys,

1553
02:07:34.40 --> 02:07:40.48
another recon man had been given that target. I said, hell, now it was too far north and he just

1554
02:07:40.48 --> 02:07:45.44
felt that the it would just be a suicide mission. Once you get in you never get out other than

1555
02:07:45.44 --> 02:07:50.64
a casket or a body bag. But there's no talking between teens much because everything is like,

1556
02:07:50.64 --> 02:07:57.76
you got a mission, you do your mission, they do it errors. So yeah, well, I already gave you a fair

1557
02:07:57.76 --> 02:08:02.88
warning before we started this that we're probably going to have to have you come back on here.

1558
02:08:02.88 --> 02:08:10.16
Because I mean, I got just, I mean, this these books are, there's awesome the detail that you go

1559
02:08:10.16 --> 02:08:17.12
on to and just the experiences you've had, which are just it's a miracle that you're sitting here,

1560
02:08:17.12 --> 02:08:22.40
talking and able to tell us what you went through when, as far as I can tell,

1561
02:08:23.52 --> 02:08:28.000
there's no way in hell you should be sitting here right now. I agree. I mean, there are times when

1562
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:33.36
in talking to friends or people that've read the book, you know, particularly on page 202

1563
02:08:33.36 --> 02:08:39.28
would the guy touches your boot. I mean, I've talked to people, it's just like it feels surreal even

1564
02:08:39.28 --> 02:08:48.08
today. It's like thank God everybody at home was praying. And the last thing I want to read from

1565
02:08:48.08 --> 02:08:54.32
the book is just this section right here, the dedication, it says this book is dedicated to all

1566
02:08:54.32 --> 02:09:02.08
sog reconnaissance team members, both US special forces and indigenous troops, as well as to every man

1567
02:09:02.08 --> 02:09:08.96
in every air support unit, especially the King B pilots of the 219th South Vietnamese Air Forces

1568
02:09:08.96 --> 02:09:16.64
special operation squadron who worked daily with sog teams on the ground across the fence in America's

1569
02:09:16.64 --> 02:09:27.12
secret war. This book is also for every man in sog and their support units who made the ultimate

1570
02:09:27.12 --> 02:09:36.24
sacrifice. Yeah, because today as we sit here, there are still 1,589 Americans missing

1571
02:09:36.24 --> 02:09:41.84
an action in Southeast Asia from the Vietnam War that includes CIA, SF, Reggur Army,

1572
02:09:41.84 --> 02:09:51.60
and Lea Solone, 50 green berets, are amongst those MIAs, over 140 aviation army Marine Corps

1573
02:09:52.40 --> 02:09:57.84
Air Force, MIA's diet supporting our missions here, just how deadly it was.

1574
02:09:59.04 --> 02:10:05.28
You guys had a over 100% casualty rate. Yeah, several of our guys have multiple purple hearts,

1575
02:10:05.28 --> 02:10:12.32
Bob Howard, received eight, he had been put in for 11, he was a recipient of the metal abonner in

1576
02:10:12.32 --> 02:10:20.48
December 68 for a mission out of costume and yeah, the cashew rate did exceed 100%.

1577
02:10:20.48 --> 02:10:28.08
Yeah, and I couldn't find any numbers on the numbers that were actually killed, but that was a

1578
02:10:28.08 --> 02:10:36.32
massive number percentage wise of guys in sog that were killed. Right. Yeah, the numbers are hard to track

1579
02:10:37.52 --> 02:10:43.28
and I'm working with a gal now who's a real, she's a retired master sergeant from the 101st.

1580
02:10:43.28 --> 02:10:48.40
She's beginning to do some research to try to put that number together because during a war,

1581
02:10:48.40 --> 02:10:55.04
3.2 men American served in Vietnam. That includes the 500,000 sailors that were off the coast

1582
02:10:55.04 --> 02:11:02.24
and your seals that were going up north and out of that 20,000, approximately 20,000 were

1583
02:11:02.24 --> 02:11:11.76
SF out of the SF, approximately 2,000 went to sag. Out of that depends on which author you talk to,

1584
02:11:11.76 --> 02:11:17.44
there's no hard stats anywhere, it's because SF was not as good as the seals, I keep her records.

1585
02:11:17.44 --> 02:11:25.60
And it'd be between 500 to 700 maybe 800 green braids actually went across the fence with

1586
02:11:25.60 --> 02:11:37.36
recon missions out of the 3.2 million. Those are our numbers. Yeah, amazing. Well, I hope you

1587
02:11:37.36 --> 02:11:42.24
don't mind coming back here. I'll be honored to come back because I've heard some of your stories pal.

1588
02:11:42.24 --> 02:11:48.48
Did you believe my stories are a big joke? I conversed with one of one of the guys that was in

1589
02:11:48.48 --> 02:11:54.40
Romadi with me, guy by the name of Dave Burke, he was a Marine Corps anglico guy on the ground with us.

1590
02:11:56.40 --> 02:12:04.000
We always joke about our experiences. He had a friend, we had him on the podcast who served in

1591
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:09.04
World War II, Korean Vietnam. Really, he was a purple heart recipient in every war,

1592
02:12:09.04 --> 02:12:16.24
everyone was worse. That's the way I feel standing here talking to you. I'm a

1593
02:12:16.24 --> 02:12:21.52
in a totally different and much lower category of experience, but that's why it's such an honor to

1594
02:12:21.52 --> 02:12:25.20
sit here and talk with you. Well, that's mutual. If you have any other closing thoughts to,

1595
02:12:25.20 --> 02:12:28.96
well, the only thing about this book actually I just want to mention that I could have done it

1596
02:12:28.96 --> 02:12:36.96
without my wife. Awesome. My dear wife Anna, at the time we had 14 ages and one newborn in the house.

1597
02:12:36.96 --> 02:12:44.32
And since you've imagined that turmoil and I'm working that at a fish wrapper up in North County.

1598
02:12:44.88 --> 02:12:49.04
And so between the fish wrapper and the kids, she goes, go right to book.

1599
02:12:49.60 --> 02:12:53.44
Awesome. She's supportive of it. That is one thing real quick. You got home from

1600
02:12:54.48 --> 02:12:57.84
so you got out shortly there after when you got to done with Vietnam. Is that that's when you were

1601
02:12:57.84 --> 02:13:03.68
done right? You got out of the army shortly thereafter? Yeah, I went back to CNC for a second tour

1602
02:13:03.68 --> 02:13:09.28
and then I got the army in April 25. That's what book two is about. Going back. One tour wasn't enough

1603
02:13:09.28 --> 02:13:15.20
at CNC. Well, you know what? If you're honest with you, I came back in, by the time I landed

1604
02:13:15.20 --> 02:13:22.32
in the States, like May 1, May 2, 1969, the anti war movement was going on strong. There was a woodstock,

1605
02:13:22.32 --> 02:13:29.28
our men walked on the moon, but I hated it. We were and I was supposed to go to Fort Bragg with

1606
02:13:29.28 --> 02:13:34.08
the regular SF, but they put us in tenths, best of forces group was us up in Massachusetts.

1607
02:13:34.96 --> 02:13:42.80
And they had five companies, ABCD and E. E was a signal company, which was Rinky Dink. They had

1608
02:13:42.80 --> 02:13:47.04
new lieutenant's butter bars running this thing. And they treated like basically can't find

1609
02:13:47.04 --> 02:13:51.84
us out. And the top and off they had old career sergeants that are all overweight,

1610
02:13:52.40 --> 02:13:57.20
all an embarrassment to the parade they wore. And they came in and put me up with a tune sergeant.

1611
02:13:57.20 --> 02:14:05.84
And I'm in this environment that was not a good chemistry. So I heard that the MPs were coming

1612
02:14:05.84 --> 02:14:10.96
basically and I went out to Pentagon, I had a woman Billy Alexander who hinted our orders.

1613
02:14:11.60 --> 02:14:17.20
And I told what kind of wine and what flowers she liked. So before I went down here, I had her wine,

1614
02:14:17.20 --> 02:14:22.000
her flowers. And Thursday morning I get to the Pentagon at 7 o'clock,

1615
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.40
get her to flowers no wine. Went back to sleep in the park a lot, came back at 4 o'clock,

1616
02:14:26.40 --> 02:14:31.92
she gave me the orders to nom. I cleared on Friday. The MPs came on Monday and I was back in my team

1617
02:14:31.92 --> 02:14:37.44
and we later. 4 o'clock the MPs covered for. And some bar fights brought in destruction. They

1618
02:14:37.44 --> 02:14:43.68
had reports of a 442 which I had at time, a 442W30, which is what, us and also Bill.

1619
02:14:43.68 --> 02:14:50.000
Oh, I was like, oh, that 442. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. It's 69, which was the coolest

1620
02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:55.20
card that time. Here meet a first. Sure. There reports about that car going through the entrance gate

1621
02:14:55.20 --> 02:15:02.56
on a sideways drift. I'm sorry, when entered the base on the exit gate, that's what it was. The MPs

1622
02:15:02.56 --> 02:15:07.44
weren't happy about that. They couldn't catch me and I was able to hide within our concrete,

1623
02:15:07.44 --> 02:15:12.96
but they were trying to begin to figure things out. But anyways, they were coming. Sounds like

1624
02:15:12.96 --> 02:15:18.32
the next podcast. That's the warm up for the next podcast. We'll, we'll take it for their next time.

1625
02:15:18.32 --> 02:15:22.72
Like a bad dream. I'll be back if you ask. Thank you. No, that's awesome. These books

1626
02:15:22.72 --> 02:15:27.12
across the fence, which one do you think people should write read first? Across the fence is the

1627
02:15:27.12 --> 02:15:32.72
first. That's my book about my getting involved in, et cetera. And the stories of other people,

1628
02:15:32.72 --> 02:15:38.000
which by the way, we have a greenberry medic John Walton who was the son of Sam Walton.

1629
02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.84
You heard a story called Walmart. Mm-hmm. Sun. One of the best medics. There was at the time,

1630
02:15:43.84 --> 02:15:50.48
chapter four, where a fellow greenberry is as leg blown off. And the fun of the music I shot four

1631
02:15:50.48 --> 02:15:57.44
times, John brought them all back and Tom Cunningham's alive today and has two children. Thanks,

1632
02:15:57.44 --> 02:16:02.24
DeJohn. That's awesome. These books are available on Amazon. Amazon. Go to Amazon or be able to

1633
02:16:02.24 --> 02:16:09.76
with ebooks or paperbacks. And then on website is socronacles.com. Socronacles.com. That's the name of

1634
02:16:09.76 --> 02:16:15.04
volume one. That's another book. Right. And then on the ground, the secret war in Vietnam. That's the

1635
02:16:15.04 --> 02:16:20.32
second book. The second book. If then here there are some stories I missed because of deadlines. Right.

1636
02:16:20.32 --> 02:16:27.28
And the first story we have, the RVContimes in our worst target, Oscar 8, and the NBA come up

1637
02:16:27.28 --> 02:16:32.24
and tap them on the children and say, it's your turn for God, duty. Oh, that's pretty close to the

1638
02:16:32.24 --> 02:16:39.84
enemy. All right. We will cover these books in the future. Everyone go buy these books. So you're ready.

1639
02:16:39.84 --> 02:16:45.12
And thank you. Really true honor to have you on. Appreciate it. honor to be here. And thank you.

1640
02:16:45.12 --> 02:16:54.80
There we go. Happy back. Happy turn. Outstanding. Thank you. And with that, Mr. John, a striker,

1641
02:16:54.80 --> 02:17:03.28
Meyer has left the building. And what an honor it was to talk to him. And I can absolutely promise

1642
02:17:03.28 --> 02:17:12.08
we're having that guy back on. And thanks to you, John, for your for your service and your sacrifice

1643
02:17:12.08 --> 02:17:20.000
in this sacrifice is your teammates. It is meant like you that have allowed us to live the way that we live.

1644
02:17:21.28 --> 02:17:32.64
And that is in freedom. So he has left the building and echo, speaking of living,

1645
02:17:33.92 --> 02:17:40.56
living the way we should live. What do you got for us? Well, as we have been doing,

1646
02:17:40.56 --> 02:17:49.68
talking about duty to first duty to martial arts, capability is what it is. That's really what it is.

1647
02:17:49.68 --> 02:17:55.04
You want to generalize like the whole thing into one big nugget, capability. Just improve your capabilities.

1648
02:17:55.04 --> 02:18:00.80
We want to improve our capabilities. Oh, yeah. Sure way to do that. Not just in the martial

1649
02:18:00.80 --> 02:18:06.72
fields, but in life. It's to train some of that duty too. Yeah. I was talking to there's a girl

1650
02:18:06.72 --> 02:18:11.76
named Kara who trains here. You know, I see her every once in a while. I'll see her whatever. And

1651
02:18:12.80 --> 02:18:19.28
she said basically the stuff we were saying, where she was like, I was like, but I only see her sort of

1652
02:18:19.28 --> 02:18:23.04
in the men's class. And I said, hey, have you tried the women's class? They're women's class. Good.

1653
02:18:24.16 --> 02:18:28.96
Developed. And then she was like, not yet. I want to whatever. And I was like, yeah, that's I think a lot of the

1654
02:18:28.96 --> 02:18:36.16
times will offer more benefits depending on who you are as a girl. We'll offer benefits because you

1655
02:18:36.16 --> 02:18:43.20
can get like the moves you can kind of do, you know, on a body that's more similar to yours. So you

1656
02:18:43.20 --> 02:18:47.76
can go through the moves a little bit like more thoroughly I think in a way for lack of a better way

1657
02:18:47.76 --> 02:18:51.60
putting it. She was like, yeah, that's good. That's true. She's like, you know what though? I really

1658
02:18:51.60 --> 02:18:56.88
like, there's a lot of value here in the guys in the men's class. And she said straight for self-defense.

1659
02:18:56.88 --> 02:19:01.68
For sure. And I was like, yeah, she's like, yeah, because like when you get used to guys and

1660
02:19:01.68 --> 02:19:06.80
meanwhile, there's like two guys scrolling like hard though. You look kind of with the rolling and

1661
02:19:06.80 --> 02:19:12.08
they're grunting it right in front of us like sweating and split their split sweat. She's like,

1662
02:19:12.08 --> 02:19:16.32
when you get with it, and we kind of laugh because we she like motions to them. And I'm thinking like,

1663
02:19:16.32 --> 02:19:21.36
yeah, any girl to come in and see that or anyone, even. Anyone, whoever's the paid in that. Yeah,

1664
02:19:21.36 --> 02:19:25.92
I think you're not going to do that. No way, man. I'm not ready for that. All right. Those are not ready for that.

1665
02:19:25.92 --> 02:19:30.000
Oh, yeah. And what if you just all of a sudden, like one day you go to the grocery store and

1666
02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:36.16
go, now you got to deal with that? Man, that's tough. There's a big psychological gap you need to make up.

1667
02:19:36.16 --> 02:19:40.40
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. She changed your jitz. Yeah, she was like, I'm used to it. And she's not a big girl either.

1668
02:19:40.40 --> 02:19:44.80
She's just like a pretty small girl. She's like, yeah, and she's too nice. You know, nice.

1669
02:19:44.80 --> 02:19:49.36
She's like, yeah, I'm kind of, and I'm really used to that. And I've been training for it,

1670
02:19:49.36 --> 02:19:54.32
like almost a year now. I'm like a big difference. That's that's good that you can come in here

1671
02:19:54.32 --> 02:20:00.96
as often as you do and have that mindset. That's good. That's going to get you places. 100%.

1672
02:20:00.96 --> 02:20:06.24
So we're talking about jitzu. Oh, yeah. And then you need to start talking about the gear that is needed for

1673
02:20:06.24 --> 02:20:11.44
jitzu. Some of it. Yes. Some of the gear that you need for jitzu is a ghee. Yes. If you're going to train ghee,

1674
02:20:11.44 --> 02:20:19.04
jitzu, which we recommend strongly recommend. We also recommend you train no ghee. You train all kinds of

1675
02:20:19.04 --> 02:20:24.48
jitzu. That's what you train. If you need a ghee, what you do, get one for more jim made. Yeah,

Done in America. So boom, there's that huge deal. By the way, so yeah, American denim has

1683
02:21:06.40 --> 02:21:13.84
we have some new jeans, good ones. Jogger, you know, sweatpants, sweat, athletic gear,

1684
02:21:13.84 --> 02:21:22.56
boom, originmain, their supplements. Mm-hmm. Big deal. Pretty much all the essential supplements

1685
02:21:22.56 --> 02:21:27.04
that you're going to need as you go through this kind of a hectic path at times, the path is

1686
02:21:27.04 --> 02:21:32.56
hectic. It should be. Yeah, kind of cheesy. That's not the path we want to be on. Yeah, that's the path

1687
02:21:32.56 --> 02:21:37.60
leads down. Yeah, it's going to be easy if it's a downhill situation because all you're going to do

1688
02:21:37.60 --> 02:21:43.28
sit there and slide. Don't take the path down. Yeah. So yes, the supplements are joint warfare

1689
02:21:43.28 --> 02:21:48.72
for your joints. Joint warfare is more for like if you have a get abuse on your joints. You're running

1690
02:21:48.72 --> 02:21:53.52
a lot. You're doing your jitsu, you're twisting a lot. And you're going every day or something like this,

1691
02:21:53.92 --> 02:21:57.52
or you're just lifting every day. You're lifting every day. Oh, yeah. So basically, if you're doing

1692
02:21:57.52 --> 02:22:01.84
physical activity. Yeah, that's kind of like hard. I mean, I guess you could break it down like

1693
02:22:01.84 --> 02:22:08.08
over you're doing some weak physical activity. Then you might not need it, but I think not

1694
02:22:08.08 --> 02:22:12.48
to do so much with Joe or for you made a good point though at the master. Remember because your knee is like kind

1695
02:22:12.48 --> 02:22:19.20
of on the final stages of healing. Yeah. And you were like, I was like, how's your knee or whatever?

1696
02:22:19.20 --> 02:22:24.72
And you're like, uh, what would you say? Oh, it was good, but like, since I've been standing up on it for

1697
02:22:24.72 --> 02:22:29.60
long time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, well kind of like, yeah, that the master. Yes, it actually swelled up again.

1698
02:22:29.60 --> 02:22:35.12
Yes. Surprisingly. So here's the thing. It made me think when I was a bounce race to stand up all the time.

1699
02:22:35.12 --> 02:22:39.28
Like for the whole thing, you're standing at the front door and not the correct. Right. It's

1700
02:22:39.28 --> 02:22:45.84
acting. The path is like it. And the struggle is real. And, but I have dress shoes on. I don't

1701
02:22:45.84 --> 02:22:50.64
have the new balance or the, you know, the deal. It's like dress shoes. So it's like, it was

1702
02:22:50.64 --> 02:22:57.04
a man joint warfare. What a human being. So, you know, varying levels of heart. So get some

1703
02:22:57.04 --> 02:23:01.84
joint warfare for your joints. Get some acrylic oil for your joints. That's general maintenance of

1704
02:23:01.84 --> 02:23:08.32
your joints. Yes. Life support. Yes. And then discipline and discipline go, which is sort of like,

1705
02:23:09.84 --> 02:23:19.12
gives you a little bit of that. Yeah. Little edge mentally shot in a split.

1706
02:23:19.12 --> 02:23:28.16
One be illegal. Negative. If you are going to confront someone in an intellectual battle,

1707
02:23:28.16 --> 02:23:35.60
what is it legal for you to take discipline go? And they don't. Should not be illegal,

1708
02:23:35.60 --> 02:23:40.96
because it's not any legal drug. It's not even drugs. It's actually a good one. It's no, right?

1709
02:23:40.96 --> 02:23:46.000
Yeah. Good. We lifting weights in advantage. We lift or the results from lifting weights in advantage.

1710
02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:52.48
The results from eating salads. That's an advantage. So boom. Same thing. But discipline just tastes

1711
02:23:52.48 --> 02:23:58.72
really good and have that advantage over your enemy. Whoever they may be. Yes. Then we got a,

1712
02:23:58.72 --> 02:24:07.28
we also got moch, which is moch. Let's just, let's just protein. I had a moch shake last night.

1713
02:24:07.28 --> 02:24:14.000
I meet loaf. No potatoes. Meet loaf carrots. Moch shake. That's a good meal right there.

1714
02:24:14.80 --> 02:24:18.80
Chocolate, dark, the darkness and I put peanut butter in it.

1715
02:24:18.80 --> 02:24:25.12
Boom. Literally my late dinner last night. That was 10 days. Yeah. That's the moch.

1716
02:24:25.12 --> 02:24:29.28
And you can give it to your kids too. You can get the water your kid moch for your kids.

1717
02:24:29.28 --> 02:24:34.80
Yeah. So your kids. So your kids instead of turning out to be like an obese, out-of-shape kid

1718
02:24:35.60 --> 02:24:39.84
that you were like trying to, no, don't even put them on that path. Put them on the moch tray.

1719
02:24:39.84 --> 02:24:45.20
Let me ask you this. When you were young. Yes. And you went to whatever.

1720
02:24:45.20 --> 02:24:49.44
I met you school junior high, whatever. Did you bring home lunch?

1721
02:24:52.48 --> 02:24:58.32
Sometimes. Yeah. So not very often. Okay. So do you, as far as you can remember,

1722
02:24:58.32 --> 02:25:02.32
did you, did you have a healthy home lunch? Did you, was your, you know, nothing.

1723
02:25:02.32 --> 02:25:06.16
And we didn't even know what healthy was. Okay. That wasn't even a thing. Yes. So that's

1724
02:25:06.16 --> 02:25:10.48
it. That was just like, what do you like to eat? Peanut. And what, what do you like to eat? And what's

1725
02:25:10.48 --> 02:25:16.40
cheap? Yes. Right. Because we're going to get you when I get new coal cuts. Right. Because there's

1726
02:25:16.40 --> 02:25:25.76
cost money. Guess what doesn't cost money? Well, jam. PB and jam. Right. Peter and jelly. Go to

1727
02:25:25.76 --> 02:25:31.84
all day long on on on white bread. Oh, white bread. That's okay. On white bread. And then you know what?

1728
02:25:31.84 --> 02:25:42.08
You get the little bad, the little party mix of potato chips, fredo, lays, Doritos, which I never

1729
02:25:42.08 --> 02:25:46.40
liked or used. I still don't like Doritos. But then you get some of that. And then like some

1730
02:25:46.40 --> 02:25:52.000
chocolate chips. Some chips, a hole cookies. You know what those are? Yeah. Get the sweet little, little,

1731
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.16
mini, sleeve, a chips, a hole. Yeah. That's a, and so there's nothing nutritional. Right. There's

1732
02:25:56.16 --> 02:26:01.44
the nutritional value of this lunch is zero. You had nothing. Yeah. That's case scenario. I used to

1733
02:26:01.44 --> 02:26:09.20
get the chocolate milk from the, you know, because that cost five cents for a white milk,

1734
02:26:09.84 --> 02:26:14.32
seven cents for a chocolate milk. Oh, the my school school lunch. Yeah. So I used to get that. That would

1735
02:26:14.32 --> 02:26:19.60
probably be what I actually lived off of because everything else was just poising in a wrapper.

1736
02:26:19.60 --> 02:26:24.64
Basically. Yeah. So that is that is that is your question. Well, I mean the reason I was asking

1737
02:26:24.64 --> 02:26:29.68
is because okay, so my family or my mom, more than my dad I guess, but you know, my mom took

1738
02:26:29.68 --> 02:26:34.56
care of the home lunches in the event of us bringing a home lunch. She, she's health conscious.

1739
02:26:34.56 --> 02:26:39.12
She was like a hippie, you know. So we had like the whole week bread. Okay. You know the, the,

1740
02:26:40.08 --> 02:26:45.68
and then what though, how old are you? I will be 42 this year. Yeah. So you're like five years

1741
02:26:45.68 --> 02:26:50.48
younger than me. There's a difference there in terms of what people were even thinking.

1742
02:26:51.04 --> 02:26:56.80
Yeah. Well, keep in mind, everyone wasn't like that. I'm saying my mom was my mom was like a

1743
02:26:56.80 --> 02:27:01.36
hippie. She was different than everyone. And here's my point with that, where when we'd come to

1744
02:27:01.36 --> 02:27:06.72
school and I bring home lunch, we'd get sort of teased. Because it's like, you don't get the cool

1745
02:27:06.72 --> 02:27:12.56
snacks, the cool freedom, what I believe. Chips and cookies in like the cool fun stuff. Oh, no.

1746
02:27:12.56 --> 02:27:17.68
They're not an up in the milk. Negative. No, you got we got the whole wheat sandwich with like

1747
02:27:17.68 --> 02:27:25.28
turkey from a real turkey with sprouted grains. So we're sorry, we're about that sprouted grain. Oh,

1748
02:27:25.28 --> 02:27:31.04
that's nice. And they're like level. Right. So it is. It is. On the last, we got laughed at that.

1749
02:27:31.04 --> 02:27:35.60
My mom and that guy was coming in hard with the sprouted grain bread with a health. Yeah.

1750
02:27:35.60 --> 02:27:40.08
And never was making fun of you. Because it's like cardboard. I don't even know because they don't

1751
02:27:40.08 --> 02:27:43.84
know how tasted it. It's not that it's more of a social thing. Everyone knows that cookies are

1752
02:27:43.84 --> 02:27:48.32
young. Young. Everyone knows that like chips are delicious for snack and all this stuff.

1753
02:27:48.32 --> 02:27:51.92
We didn't have that. We had like the snacks that they knew that weren't that good. Carried.

1754
02:27:51.92 --> 02:27:56.80
Taste and carrots and like carrots are pretty tasty though. I think so now. Yeah. I think it's

1755
02:27:56.80 --> 02:28:00.88
good about carrots. If you're not eating sugar and you eat a carrot taste sweet. Yeah, it is.

1756
02:28:00.88 --> 02:28:04.40
You're like, oh, this is super sweet. Oh, it's good. You can eat too many carrots because

1757
02:28:04.40 --> 02:28:09.12
your body can't that just them fully if you eat too many of them just that way. I've made

1758
02:28:09.12 --> 02:28:13.76
that mistake before. It's pounding bags. It hurts. I do like one of those bags of carrots. Your

1759
02:28:13.76 --> 02:28:17.92
gut is going to tell you. All right. I know what they're issue. Good. No, but where are you going?

1760
02:28:17.92 --> 02:28:22.56
All right. I'm making a good point unless you even talk about carrots a little bit more. I can't

1761
02:28:22.56 --> 02:28:26.96
we can't but unless I'm making a point. So these kids would make fun of us because they got the

1762
02:28:26.96 --> 02:28:36.88
cookies and we had like tomatoes and sprouts in our sandwiches. Yeah. But growing up when you come

1763
02:28:36.88 --> 02:28:44.16
early adulthood adulthood, that health consciousness paid off big time. Huge texture. So to make

1764
02:28:44.16 --> 02:28:49.84
the switch from non health consciousness to health consciousness, it's like it can be a grind.

1765
02:28:49.84 --> 02:28:53.84
That can be harder. Yeah. And it's just made to the path. I mean, came the path and it's already

1766
02:28:53.84 --> 02:28:59.04
instilled as being a young person. So there's that. So, milk. So my daughter comes home from school

1767
02:28:59.04 --> 02:29:04.40
literally yesterday saying they were teasing me because I had carrots. And choose, she wasn't very

1768
02:29:04.40 --> 02:29:09.52
happy about it. That's what she knows. She just started talking fools out. Well, I started to say

1769
02:29:09.52 --> 02:29:12.96
that but she was it was no time for jokes at this point because you didn't like our issues. You're

1770
02:29:12.96 --> 02:29:17.36
not like, you know, I'm choking anyone for teasing for your carrots. But this is what I said.

1771
02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:21.76
One of the things I said, I said, don't worry about them. There's not first of nothing

1772
02:29:22.64 --> 02:29:27.28
funny about carrots. Like it's not, I'm not saying it's like, or it's so serious. I'm just saying,

1773
02:29:27.28 --> 02:29:31.04
what's funny about I don't get it kind of thing. It's just like, yeah, that's kind of true. And I was like,

1774
02:29:31.04 --> 02:29:34.72
and guess what carrots are good for you. Just like your lunch is good for you. And as you grow up,

1775
02:29:34.72 --> 02:29:38.56
you're going to see the result of that. And you're going to see the results of them not eating,

1776
02:29:38.56 --> 02:29:43.12
not healthy food. Yeah. And you're going to see you need to do better than that as a father.

1777
02:29:43.76 --> 02:29:49.20
Why? Because you need a better deal. Yeah. No, she needs to be like, they say, oh, what are you eating?

1778
02:29:49.20 --> 02:29:53.76
Peel you eating some, you eat and some carrots? Yeah. And then she says, what are you eating?

1779
02:29:53.76 --> 02:29:59.52
There are some type two dieted. You're going to diet age 32. Lose her. Get out of my face for

1780
02:29:59.52 --> 02:30:04.72
I put you to sleep. All right. All that, you know, that direction. That's not part of the way

1781
02:30:04.72 --> 02:30:10.64
where you could go right there. No, that's not how I'm having fun. If on his part of life. But I

1782
02:30:10.64 --> 02:30:16.08
saw her wheels turning when she was like, like, yeah, you know, like, I will all see the results,

1783
02:30:16.08 --> 02:30:19.60
you know. And then, you know, then my wife's there and she's like, yeah, look at Dad,

1784
02:30:19.60 --> 02:30:23.92
how big is muscle? All this stuff right. So kind of, why does your wife is kind of like,

1785
02:30:23.92 --> 02:30:31.92
just making stuff up? Unless it worked. But go back to milk or your kid milk. This is what you

1786
02:30:31.92 --> 02:30:37.84
achieved with that. One of the many things is you actually made it like kind of cool to have a

1787
02:30:37.84 --> 02:30:43.28
healthy thing, have a healthy snack. We're going to sway a lot of people with these books and

1788
02:30:43.28 --> 02:30:50.40
this stuff. I mean, I see that. It is happening. It's awesome to see. All right, dude, we got to rock

1789
02:30:50.40 --> 02:30:55.92
it off. Come on. But that was an important story. That was a long, that was 12 minutes. Anyway,

1790
02:30:55.92 --> 02:30:59.76
deep, I'm like, all right. We got Jockel White tea. How about that? Jockel White tea. Tell me about it.

1791
02:30:59.76 --> 02:31:05.60

1816
02:33:42.24 --> 02:33:46.56
We have a YouTube channel. Did you know that? Yes, right. And it's called,

1817
02:33:46.56 --> 02:33:53.52
Jockel podcast. And it's on YouTube. So podcast is not just a podcast where it's audio only.

1818
02:33:54.24 --> 02:33:59.68
On the video version, you can see us. If you want to know what John Striker Meyer looks like,

1819
02:34:00.16 --> 02:34:05.28
you can watch this on YouTube. This is getting a lot of views on YouTube. Yeah. Listen to

1820
02:34:05.28 --> 02:34:12.000
John Striker Meyer and hear his stories. Yeah. So check that out. Also, echo Charles makes

1821
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:17.92
what he calls enhanced videos. Some people might call them distracting from the message.

1822
02:34:19.12 --> 02:34:26.24
Sure, they might. Some people like them. They have millions of views. Some of your videos that you've

1823
02:34:26.24 --> 02:34:32.72
made. Do you know what? Oh, yeah. I did. A lot of views. Well, like I said or like you said, yeah,

1824
02:34:32.72 --> 02:34:39.04
you can call them distractions on the message, which I actually won't even argue with it. Thank you.

1825
02:34:39.04 --> 02:34:47.52
But some people look at it or see it as enhanced. Oh, that's what you look at there. You put in

1826
02:34:47.52 --> 02:34:51.68
enhances the message. It's kind of like kind of like, you know, when you have a dog and you got to feed

1827
02:34:51.68 --> 02:34:55.92
them the heartworm pills. You know, where the pills, the heartworm pills is good from. It's good.

1828
02:34:55.92 --> 02:35:02.16
That message is good. But sometimes you've got to put it in the food, you know? So like taste good.

1829
02:35:02.16 --> 02:35:06.64
It's like the message gets delivered. So my message is so hard to swallow that you have to put like

1830
02:35:06.64 --> 02:35:11.44
videos around it. Is what I'm hearing music around it? Yes, sometimes. Break at the jealous. Sometimes.

1831
02:35:11.44 --> 02:35:16.16
Yes. Yeah. Hey, so that's the YouTube channel. Check them out. And then we also got psychological

1832
02:35:16.16 --> 02:35:22.72
warfare, which is on iTunes, Google Play, other MP3 platforms. And if you want an alarm clock,

1833
02:35:23.92 --> 02:35:29.28
that's me talking. Then you go to psychological warfare. That's what you get. And you'll see that

1834
02:35:29.28 --> 02:35:35.04
you can use it as a alarm clock or you can use it as an emergency, as an emergency air cover.

1835
02:35:35.04 --> 02:35:41.92
Yes. Fire support. You're like, I'm not sure if I should work out right now. Press play on the

1836
02:35:41.92 --> 02:35:48.56
on the psychological warfare track that's about not working out. And you will get up and you will go to the gym.

1837
02:35:48.56 --> 02:35:54.88
And if you're about to eat some donuts or some chocolate chip cookies, right?

1838
02:35:54.88 --> 02:35:59.76
Sure, chips are only whatever chips are holy. You've been to sleeve a random chips are

1839
02:35:59.76 --> 02:36:05.84
playing around somewhere. You know, use that term for the first time when it was James Neilson.

1840
02:36:05.84 --> 02:36:11.68
What? James Neilson would talk about eating a sleeve or a meal just get after it.

1841
02:36:13.20 --> 02:36:20.000
James Neilson, a world's toughest accountant. A great yes. Blackbelt and Jiu Jitsu for a long time.

1842
02:36:20.56 --> 02:36:28.40
One of the OG American true Jiu Jitsu practitioners teaches on on Saturdays here at Vickory

1843
02:36:28.40 --> 02:36:32.96
MMA in fitness, which by the way is our gym in San Diego, California. Do you have a train,

1844
02:36:32.96 --> 02:36:36.56
so? You know what's funny about that too? Where, you know, he said, oh yeah, the world's tough as a

1845
02:36:36.56 --> 02:36:41.52
accountant, right? Any teachers Jiu Jitsu too. So teach Jiu Jitsu, that's a job. Like that's a career. Like you're a

1846
02:36:41.52 --> 02:36:46.96
Jiu Jitsu instructor. True. But he's like, he's an accountant. But he's just Jiu Jitsu. It's not like an accountant

1847
02:36:46.96 --> 02:36:52.88
is like some, you know, scraping by sort of gay. No, no, no, no, it's like that's a, and there's a few

1848
02:36:52.88 --> 02:36:59.36
people like that. You know why? Because teaching Jiu Jitsu is fun. And it makes you better at Jiu Jitsu. That's just how it is

1849
02:36:59.36 --> 02:37:04.96
man. The nature of the game. That's un psychological warfare. Also you can get it if you want some

1850
02:37:04.96 --> 02:37:12.32
visual representation of the path to keep you there. You can go to flipsidecampus.com, run by my brother

1851
02:37:12.32 --> 02:37:21.28
Dakota Meyer. He makes art with layers. With layers, the layers are free. They're not free. They

1852
02:37:21.28 --> 02:37:27.76
come with the cost of the art. Right, layers included layers included. There you go. Yes. We've designed

1853
02:37:27.76 --> 02:37:33.12
some of the items there. Yeah. You know, let them know. Like hey, this would be kind of cool over here.

1854
02:37:33.92 --> 02:37:38.40
And if you want something just just request to go to on Twitter, I think is the best place. Yeah.

1855
02:37:38.40 --> 02:37:42.40
And that's cool. Flipsidecampus.com if you want to get some cool stuff to hang up in your house.

1856
02:37:42.40 --> 02:37:48.80
So back to psychological warfare. If you use that whole thing as a playlist, psychological warfare,

1857
02:37:48.80 --> 02:37:52.48
even if it doesn't apply to it, you're not eating donuts. Well, a playlist while you work out.

1858
02:37:52.48 --> 02:37:56.000
You're even if you're not eating donuts while you work out, which most of us do not.

1859
02:37:56.72 --> 02:38:02.40
It still, it like it puts you in this mindset of like, you know, working and re-pain results of

1860
02:38:02.40 --> 02:38:08.48
work. Yeah. It goes back to the podcast machete season when they talk about how the power of the

1861
02:38:08.48 --> 02:38:12.88
audio into your ear. Yeah. Yeah. That's what's happening with psychological warfare. Yes. It's going

1862
02:38:12.88 --> 02:38:15.84
right in your ear. You're like, you walk, you get done listening to that. You're not even thinking

1863
02:38:15.84 --> 02:38:20.40
about the fact that you're thinking about the fact, yeah, here I just said, you're not even thinking

1864
02:38:20.40 --> 02:38:26.56
about the fact that you are thinking about the fact that you don't want donuts, that you want to

1865
02:38:26.56 --> 02:38:31.12
get in the gym, that you want to attack your project. Oh yeah. That's what's happening. Yeah. It's

1866
02:38:31.12 --> 02:38:36.32
true. 100% true. Also, while you're living, if you're lifting that home, if we're doing the

1867
02:38:36.32 --> 02:38:41.84
lifting the home, which I do, which you do, which a lot of us do, actually, people hit me up,

1868
02:38:41.84 --> 02:38:46.64
show me their home set up. Awesome. You should have kettlebells in my opinion.

1869
02:38:46.64 --> 02:38:52.88
kettlebells is one of them pretty much the biggest, as far as changes to my workout, the most

1870
02:38:52.88 --> 02:38:59.04
valuable change that I changed my workout. Functionality. Functionality. Like the band buzz

1871
02:38:59.04 --> 02:39:03.68
word. One time I was doing, you know, you got to have introduced you have risk control, you know,

1872
02:39:03.68 --> 02:39:07.92
and varying levels of risk control depending on the position. I was rolling with a guy literally,

1873
02:39:07.92 --> 02:39:15.76
like he's like trying to release my grip from his wrist or whatever, and like he's visibly angry,

1874
02:39:15.76 --> 02:39:20.56
because he couldn't. So I just sort of sat there and just let him like do it, whatever. And I was

1875
02:39:20.56 --> 02:39:25.68
just technique because technically he should be able to get out of that. Sure. But I've been doing

1876
02:39:25.68 --> 02:39:32.000
those kettlebells. So my risk control is a lot, we'll say the effectiveness is a lot higher.

1877
02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.88
Unless my original point kettlebells, this is where I get my kettlebells from on it. So you

1878
02:39:36.88 --> 02:39:40.72
go to on it.com slash jackel there. You can get these kettlebells and they're all the cool ones,

1879
02:39:40.72 --> 02:39:47.04
too. By the way, like always say Darth Vader, my most recent one, Stormtrooper kettlebell.

1880
02:39:47.68 --> 02:39:52.80
My second most recent one, and not to mention all the other primal bells and legend bells that

1881
02:39:52.80 --> 02:40:00.08
I have from there. Also, at on it is the electrolyte mineral mix. That's part of my daily

1882
02:40:00.08 --> 02:40:11.20
make mix with jackel's discipline. Like I said, the mineral electrolyte mix, water. Maybe a little

1883
02:40:11.20 --> 02:40:17.92
gatorid if I'm feeling a little feisty. And oh, that's how you take a joint warfare and grow oil.

1884
02:40:17.92 --> 02:40:23.44
Don't don't drink gatorid or grow a little stuff. There we got some books, too. We got

1885
02:40:23.44 --> 02:40:27.52
way in the warrior kid three where there's a will. It's out right now. And for everyone that's

1886
02:40:27.52 --> 02:40:34.56
got that so far, awesome. Appreciate it. Write some reviews. So I know what you think of it. That is cool.

1887
02:40:35.36 --> 02:40:41.20
If you have warrior the warrior kid three where there's a will, that means you should also have

1888
02:40:41.20 --> 02:40:46.88
where the warrior kid one and two. Number two is called Mark's mission. Also, we got Mikey in the

1889
02:40:46.88 --> 02:40:54.80
dragons. Best children's book ever written according to a lot of people. A lot of people.

1890
02:40:54.80 --> 02:41:02.48
I dig it. A lot of people when telling me that. Tons of people. No, seriously, check out Mikey

1891
02:41:02.48 --> 02:41:06.40
in the dragons to help your kids overcome fear. Fear of all kinds. Also got the discipline

1892
02:41:06.40 --> 02:41:10.56
equals freedom field manual. If you need to know how to get after it. If you want the audio

1893
02:41:10.56 --> 02:41:14.56
version of that, it's on iTunes Amazon, music and Google Play. Also, we got extreme ownership

1894
02:41:14.56 --> 02:41:20.08
and the dichotomy of leadership written by myself and my brother, Dave Babin. Extreme ownership.

1895
02:41:20.08 --> 02:41:27.68
Number one, the selling business book, since it got released the whole time. We just got that

1896
02:41:27.68 --> 02:41:37.44
little stat. It's got the big stat. Yeah, yeah. Some people tell me that dichotomy of leadership is

1897
02:41:37.44 --> 02:41:46.88
better. It's a good combo. I'll leave it at that. Asheline front, that is my leadership

1919
02:43:58.96 --> 02:44:08.32
veterans out there, especially those like John Stracker-Mire. Volunteer and volunteered and volunteered

1920
02:44:08.32 --> 02:44:17.60
again to do the hardest missions in the worst areas for zero recognition by the way, not even from

1921
02:44:17.60 --> 02:44:25.60
your own friends and family. Those are true heroes and we are forever indebted to them. We are also

1922

border patrol, secret service, all first respondents. Thanks for keeping us safe. Here at home and to

1924
02:44:40.80 --> 02:44:52.72
everyone else. I know that life can be stressful. But chances are you aren't surrounded by

1925
02:44:52.72 --> 02:44:59.12
elephant grass that is 12 feet tall and burning and closing in on your chances are you aren't

1926
02:44:59.12 --> 02:45:10.16
being assaulted by NVA soldiers. Chances are you aren't facing death. But at the same time,

1927
02:45:10.16 --> 02:45:22.08
actually you are facing death. We are all facing death. So remember like John Stracker-Mire said,

1928
02:45:22.08 --> 02:45:38.40
every breath of air is sweet and our gift is to be alive. So go out there and live.

1929
02:45:38.40 --> 02:45:54.32
And until next time, this is echo and jacco out.
