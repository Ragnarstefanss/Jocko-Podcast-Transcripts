00:00:26.50 --> 00:00:32.46 ncdp7 learning. One purpose the
00:00:32.46 --> 00:00:34.62 commanding general, training an education command
00:00:34.62 --> 00:00:37.90 as published Marine Corps documental publication
00:00:37.90 --> 00:00:47.10 7 Learning dated 20 February 2020. Background. The common-on planning guidance released 17 July 2019
00:00:47.10 --> 00:00:53.18 establishing learning a combination of education and training as a priority focus area to develop
00:00:53.18 --> 00:01:01.74 an intellectual edge to capitalize on the unique ethos of the core and its maneuver warfare mindset.
00:01:01.74 --> 00:01:12.30 On 2020, the common-on of the Marine Corps general David H. Burger approved MCDP 7 Learning
00:01:12.30 --> 00:01:17.66 the first entirely new doctrinal publication released by the Marine Corps since 2001.
00:01:19.58 --> 00:01:26.22 MCDP 7 Learning formalizes the philosophy principles concepts and expectations of learning.
00:01:26.22 --> 00:01:34.06 MCDP 7 Learning states that the Marine Corps's learning philosophy seeks to create a culture
00:01:34.06 --> 00:01:39.02 of continuous learning and professional competence that yields adaptive leaders capable of
00:01:39.02 --> 00:01:45.58 successful, successfully conducting maneuver warfare in complex uncertain and chaotic environments.
00:01:47.50 --> 00:01:54.46 MCDP 7 Learning has been developed to codify the Marine Corps's learning philosophy and explain
00:01:54.46 --> 00:02:04.38 why learning is essential to the profession of arms. Going forward, MCDP 7 Learning will serve as a guide
00:02:04.38 --> 00:02:09.66 for a culture of continuous learning and professional competence that yields adaptive
00:02:09.66 --> 00:02:15.98 leaders who can quickly recognize changing conditions in the battle space, adapt, and make timely
00:02:15.98 --> 00:02:24.86 decisions against a thinking enemy. This publication's audience is all Marines.
00:02:26.70 --> 00:02:32.30 Coordinating instructions in an initial distribution of 11, 330 publication hard copies
00:02:32.30 --> 00:02:37.42 is underway. Units requiring additional print allocations must follow procedures identified in
00:02:37.42 --> 00:02:46.94 reference A paragraph 4A. This more admin is applicable to Marine Corps full total force.
00:02:50.94 --> 00:02:57.90 So there you go. The Marine Corps in case you didn't gather from that message has a new
00:02:57.90 --> 00:03:07.90 doctrinal publication. The first one since 2001 and there was probably not too many people that
00:03:07.90 --> 00:03:12.30 were a little bit giddy and excited about it besides myself and David R. Burke.
00:03:14.38 --> 00:03:19.98 proof. The release of this publication in its own right is proof that the Marine Corps is learning.
00:03:21.50 --> 00:03:26.70 That's a bold statement. So yeah, the Marine Corps has a new pop out.
00:03:26.70 --> 00:03:32.38 We're going to study it right now. So here we go. Marine Corps,
00:03:32.38 --> 00:03:39.02 doctional publication 7. It's called Learning. Here we go. And we'll start off with the forward
00:03:39.02 --> 00:03:44.06 Department of the Navy headquarters in its Marine Corps. The purpose of this publication is to
00:03:44.06 --> 00:03:49.18 describe the Marine Corps's learning philosophy and explain why learning is critically important
00:03:49.18 --> 00:03:55.02 to the profession of arms. While the concept, while many of the concepts in this publication
00:03:55.02 --> 00:04:00.38 have been passed on by Marine leaders throughout our history, this publication seeks to formalize
00:04:00.38 --> 00:04:07.18 them and provide aspirational goals. That's a familiar subject. Learning is an institutional
00:04:07.18 --> 00:04:15.42 priority and a professional expectation for all Marines. This mentality is key to the Marine
00:04:15.42 --> 00:04:20.22 Corps becoming a more effective learning organization. Now you're going to find as we run through
00:04:20.22 --> 00:04:24.22 this and the way they define learning and the way they talk about learning. Obviously, this does
00:04:24.22 --> 00:04:28.86 not only apply to the profession of arms and it obviously doesn't apply only to the Marine
00:04:28.86 --> 00:04:35.74 Corps and it applies to everybody in the world, every human being. Continuing on, the most
00:04:35.74 --> 00:04:40.30 important factor in this philosophy is the importance of continuous learning throughout our careers
00:04:40.30 --> 00:04:46.70 for war fighting. Continuous learning is essential to maneuver warfare because it enables
00:04:46.70 --> 00:04:51.90 Marines to quickly recognize changing conditions in the battle space, adapt and make timely
00:04:51.90 --> 00:04:58.38 decisions against a thinking enemy. These skills required in war must be learned, developed,
00:04:58.38 --> 00:05:04.54 and honed over time if neglected. They quickly atrophy. This is one of the first things that I
00:05:04.54 --> 00:05:10.70 notice is they break down this thing of when you're on the battlefield and this is so clear
00:05:10.70 --> 00:05:13.90 but when you're on the battlefield, the enemy is doing something and they're changing their tactics
00:05:13.90 --> 00:05:17.82 and we've talked about that for years what you're actually doing is you're learning what they're
00:05:17.82 --> 00:05:23.26 doing and you're learning how you need to respond to it. So the mindset of learning is that we
00:05:23.26 --> 00:05:27.58 we talk about adaptation a lot. Well, if you can't learn, you're not going to be able to adapt anything.
00:05:31.26 --> 00:05:36.14 Marines leverage the art and science of learning technologies and learning environments that
00:05:36.14 --> 00:05:41.02 reflect the changing operational environment to tailor learning and provide each other with constructive
00:05:41.02 --> 00:05:47.18 feedback. Leaders hold Marines to high professional standards of performance conduct and
00:05:47.18 --> 00:05:55.10 discipline to include learning as Marines rise in rank and position continuous learning and developing
00:05:55.10 --> 00:06:01.82 our professional skills are a professional expectation. So you are that's what it is. If you're in
00:06:01.82 --> 00:06:07.66 the Marine Corps, you're learning. That's the expectation. We must make the most of every learning
00:06:07.66 --> 00:06:14.30 opportunity fostering our subordinates learning while continuing our own. Continuous learning is
00:06:14.30 --> 00:06:18.70 important to Marines because of the fundamental nature of war and it's ever changing character.
00:06:19.26 --> 00:06:24.78 The nature of war carries a combination of fear on certainty and bigudity and bigudity,
00:06:25.42 --> 00:06:31.50 chance horror and above all friction that Marines must prepare to counter.
00:06:32.62 --> 00:06:37.26 Marines must seek out education and training opportunities that stimulate these conditions.
00:06:37.26 --> 00:06:44.70 We must train how we fight. As Marines, we must understand how important learning is and be
00:06:44.70 --> 00:06:50.86 committed to the principles laid out in this publication. Our professional responsibility as Marines
00:06:50.86 --> 00:06:56.62 is to engage in continuous learning so that we may best support our fellow Marines, our core and
00:06:56.62 --> 00:07:02.30 our nation signed the H Burger General, US Marine Corps, Comedon of the Marine Corps.
00:07:02.30 --> 00:07:08.30 That's how they kick it off and if you haven't heard Dave and I talking about any of these other
00:07:08.94 --> 00:07:13.66 any of the other Marine Corps manuals that we've covered in one of the very first things that I
00:07:13.66 --> 00:07:19.18 covered on this podcast was war fighting, which is a great publication but the Marine Corps
00:07:19.18 --> 00:07:25.50 has a way of writing publications and a way of writing. That is awesome. They nail it.
00:07:25.50 --> 00:07:36.30 Chapter one is called the nature of learning. Starts off with some quotes as a life which
00:07:39.90 --> 00:07:44.14 I really don't like. In general, I generally don't like when things start with quotes but I think
00:07:44.14 --> 00:07:49.82 the Marine Corps gets a pass here. I generally don't like when people say, even you know you'll
00:07:49.82 --> 00:07:55.58 hear someone give a speech, you know, a commencement address and they'll say in the words of
00:07:55.58 --> 00:08:05.02 so on and so and you're like, right. You know, they could have read that. If you got asked to do
00:08:05.82 --> 00:08:12.46 a graduate, a commencement speech or you got asked to give a talk, they're asking you to give that
00:08:12.46 --> 00:08:18.54 talk, right? Am I wrong? No, you're right. And look, I'm not saying that there's not times
00:08:18.54 --> 00:08:23.18 we're quote-torned. I've used them. I don't use them a lot though. I will say that. In fact, I really
00:08:23.18 --> 00:08:27.50 use them. It's going to be probably pat and or hack worth. You're shaking your hands. That's
00:08:27.50 --> 00:08:32.54 how you're going to say is it's Algrange and Mattis. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's kind of my threshold
00:08:32.54 --> 00:08:38.46 as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're going to go with the first one. As a lifetime serial learner,
00:08:38.46 --> 00:08:42.94 I found that extraordinary people can do the extraordinary who are committed to experiential learning
00:08:42.94 --> 00:08:49.02 our intellectual ecurious and possess an unquenchable desire to acquire new knowledge. This may be
00:08:49.02 --> 00:08:54.46 our only advantage in the future fight. And that's from Lorna M. I don't know how you say that last
00:08:54.46 --> 00:09:03.02 name may lock a gas, but she's a general Marine Corps from Brooklyn, New York via Jamaica.
00:09:04.06 --> 00:09:10.06 But what I like about that is this may be our only advantage in future fight because at some point
00:09:10.06 --> 00:09:16.30 the playing feels get level. And then who it's who is smarter? It's not even who is smarter.
00:09:16.30 --> 00:09:21.82 It's who can learn faster. Yeah. Algrange, 29th Common Out of the Marine Corps,
00:09:23.66 --> 00:09:30.54 two verbal arts, Mustang, by the way, Camies, by the way, if you go and look at all the Marine
00:09:30.54 --> 00:09:33.66 Corps commonouts at all and they're dressed blue as except for one. Algrange,
00:09:33.66 --> 00:09:42.46 they're saying he's in his camis getting after it. And he says, what you did isn't as important
00:09:42.46 --> 00:09:52.54 as what you were thinking. And how many times when I was in charge of training, I watched
00:09:52.54 --> 00:09:58.46 somebody do something, watch some young junior officer do something. And I look, I saw what they did.
00:09:58.46 --> 00:10:03.90 And I'd say, you know, what were you thinking when you just did that? What was your, what was
00:10:03.90 --> 00:10:08.46 in your head? What were you trying to make happen? Like I get it, I get what you did.
00:10:09.02 --> 00:10:11.82 I'm not even concerned about that. I want to know what you were thinking. Because you might have
00:10:11.82 --> 00:10:16.54 made a bad decision. You might have made a bad tactical call, but if you had a good idea,
00:10:16.54 --> 00:10:21.34 then we can figure out how to teach you the tactics of getting it done. But if you were thinking
00:10:21.34 --> 00:10:30.14 something wrong, where we have a bit much bigger problem. And then General Mattis, the most important
00:10:30.14 --> 00:10:37.42 six inches on the battlefield is between your ears. Indeed, needs no explanation. Here we go,
00:10:37.42 --> 00:10:41.42 getting into it. Warfighting is the most complex, challenging, violent, and dynamic human
00:10:41.42 --> 00:10:47.26 in-depth. The Marine Corps, as a nation's force and readiness, must have the versatility and
00:10:47.26 --> 00:10:52.70 flexibility to effectively fight and succeed in any situation and that any intensity across the
00:10:52.70 --> 00:11:00.62 full spectrum of conflict, whenever and wherever the nation calls. If you think about what that
00:11:00.62 --> 00:11:08.06 sentence says, check it out. Must have the versatility and flexibility to effectively fight and succeed
00:11:08.06 --> 00:11:14.30 in any situation. And this is the part that I think is really stands out and at any intensity.
00:11:14.30 --> 00:11:21.98 Right? This is from hand-to-hand bloodbath combat to non-combatant evacuation.
00:11:22.86 --> 00:11:27.10 Right? This is just you got to be able to do anything in the full spectrum.
00:11:28.38 --> 00:11:33.50 Continuing to meet these demands, it is critical that Marines recognize that learning has a
00:11:33.50 --> 00:11:38.62 direct impact on warfighting. Marines who understand the key learning principles and continuously
00:11:38.62 --> 00:11:45.42 seek opportunities to develop knowledge, skills, and the proper attitudes throughout their careers
00:11:45.42 --> 00:11:49.66 will develop wisdom that enables success in battle.
00:11:53.90 --> 00:11:58.06 As Marines, we pass on our wisdom and our experiences to the next generation of Marines.
00:11:58.78 --> 00:12:05.50 For the Marine Corps to remain the United States force in readiness. It is critical that every
00:12:05.50 --> 00:12:11.10 Marines strengthen and value learning in all facets of the Marine Corps culture, learning environments,
00:12:11.10 --> 00:12:17.42 and leadership development. Learning is a professional responsibility for all Marines at all levels.
00:12:20.78 --> 00:12:25.90 Learning is a professional responsibility for all Marines at all levels.
00:12:25.90 --> 00:12:31.02 Marines must develop the habit of continuous learning early in their careers to set conditions
00:12:31.02 --> 00:12:38.94 for success in increasing levels of responsibility. Really makes it pretty clear.
00:12:39.74 --> 00:12:44.22 That's what the Marine Corps do. The Marine Corps dox. Man, they nail it.
00:12:44.22 --> 00:12:47.66 You talk about simple-clear and concise columns. Yes. They just, they got it.
00:12:47.66 --> 00:12:50.94 The clear. Man, it's right there. Hey, if we're going to win wars, we got to get smart.
00:12:50.94 --> 00:12:55.98 What I find most, or one of the most impressive things about when you read this
00:12:55.98 --> 00:13:09.02 is when you read really anything Marine Corps dox pubs. A general, a colonel, a gunny sergeant,
00:13:09.82 --> 00:13:17.34 and a landscorporer. Can all read this and go, okay, I get that. And I see it.
00:13:17.34 --> 00:13:24.46 Right? That's what they do so well. It's just, they nail it. And the way they do that is simple-clear and concise.
00:13:27.50 --> 00:13:31.82 First section, learning and competence. Learning is developing knowledge skills and
00:13:31.82 --> 00:13:37.98 attitudes through study, experience or instruction. It is a never-ending progression that includes
00:13:37.98 --> 00:13:48.78 understanding why something is important, the intent of learning. What do you think?
00:13:51.82 --> 00:13:59.58 It's like, oh, okay, cool. So everything that we talk about from a decentralized command to
00:13:59.58 --> 00:14:06.14 perspective, when you apply that on an individual level for learning, the exact same rules apply.
00:14:06.14 --> 00:14:14.78 That means it is your team has to understand why they're doing what they're doing. In this case,
00:14:14.78 --> 00:14:19.18 people have to understand why something is important. What do you have to understand and
00:14:19.18 --> 00:14:22.70 decentralized command? What's the command? What's the command? What do you have to understand here?
00:14:22.70 --> 00:14:30.62 What is the intent of the learning? It goes on. Learning is much more than gathering information
00:14:30.62 --> 00:14:38.54 and reciting facts and includes cognitive, physical, social, emotional, ethical, and cultural
00:14:38.54 --> 00:14:44.78 components. Learning occurs in formal settings, like schoolhouse or training exercise, and informal
00:14:44.78 --> 00:14:51.18 settings such as social experiential, self-directed, and other ways outside the classroom.
00:14:51.74 --> 00:14:58.06 The developing knowledge, skills, and attitudes interact to influence how Marines think, respond,
00:14:58.06 --> 00:15:07.34 and act. Is it weird to think about every single thing that you do is based on what you've learned?
00:15:09.74 --> 00:15:13.90 Now, you can take the Sam Harris approach here and say that you have no free will. Yes.
00:15:15.50 --> 00:15:20.46 And then you'd have to say, okay, well, if you want to take that into the philosophical world,
00:15:20.46 --> 00:15:26.78 Sam, we get it. I'm not here to argue philosophy with Sam Harris. What I am going to tell you is this,
00:15:26.78 --> 00:15:33.34 when I would see young leaders make decisions. They were making decisions based on what they learned,
00:15:33.34 --> 00:15:43.18 what they experienced. That's where it all comes from. Learning encompasses both training and
00:15:43.18 --> 00:15:50.62 education, which are equally important and complementary. A simple explanations of the difference
00:15:50.62 --> 00:15:55.10 between training and education is that training prepares Marines to deal with known factors of war,
00:15:55.10 --> 00:16:02.30 while education prepares Marines to deal with unknown factors. It's an interesting
00:16:02.30 --> 00:16:08.14 bifurcation of those two things. I'm going to take me a little while to get my head around that,
00:16:08.14 --> 00:16:13.82 because I know a lot of the training that I ran, the purpose of the training was to get
00:16:13.82 --> 00:16:21.50 seals to learn how to deal with unknown factors. So we may have to explore that one a little bit.
00:16:21.50 --> 00:16:25.02 I don't think they're mutually exclusive, but they are different.
00:16:27.74 --> 00:16:34.38 Yeah, well, maybe we'll have to explore what they see as training and what they see as education.
00:16:34.38 --> 00:16:40.70 We'll get there. This is when I read this, I wasn't. I just, I underlined unknown factors. And I was
00:16:40.70 --> 00:16:44.38 like, yeah, of course, unknown factors. That's what we're trying to teach. Teach people how to deal with unknown
00:16:44.38 --> 00:16:52.94 factors. Training, I guess, I guess where they draw the line is like, hey, here's the, here's the
00:16:52.94 --> 00:16:56.62 procedures that we can teach you, right? That's your training. Learn this procedure, learn this procedure,
00:16:56.62 --> 00:17:00.86 learn this procedure. Education is how do you take those procedures that you've learned and
00:17:00.86 --> 00:17:05.26 who'd happen to this random new thing that you haven't seen before? Well, this is understandable.
00:17:05.26 --> 00:17:14.70 All right, I'll begin to wield my yield, I'll begin to yield to this thought process here. Training
00:17:14.70 --> 00:17:20.38 education are both a compulsion different ways, but they are required working together to instill
00:17:20.38 --> 00:17:25.18 the learning that results in readiness and effectiveness. The complexity of the modern battle field
00:17:25.18 --> 00:17:32.14 and increasing rate of change requires a highly educated force. While different education and training
00:17:32.14 --> 00:17:40.38 are inextrippically linked, education denotes study and intellectual development. Training is primarily
00:17:40.38 --> 00:17:46.06 learning by doing. Okay, so now they're laying it out of the way. Education notes study
00:17:46.06 --> 00:17:54.14 and intellectual development. Training is primarily learning by doing. Okay, we will, we will not
00:17:54.14 --> 00:17:57.82 train without the presence of education, and we must not educate without the complimentary
00:17:57.82 --> 00:18:04.38 execution of well-consuming training. Okay, I see where they're going. I'm not sure that I would
00:18:05.10 --> 00:18:09.34 I'm not sure that I would have presented this the same way. I might have to, I would have to think about this.
00:18:15.66 --> 00:18:20.86 Because training is learning by doing. Okay, I get it. Your hands on, your making stuff happen,
00:18:20.86 --> 00:18:29.58 and education is not. Education is study and intellectual development. That's what they're saying here.
00:18:31.58 --> 00:18:33.90 Okay, I think I'm starting to grasp it a little bit better.
00:18:36.54 --> 00:18:44.06 Because here's how I just grasped it in my mind. The mission of both these things is to learn.
00:18:44.06 --> 00:18:53.42 Right, and both of them result in learning. In my mind, I was thinking, well, one is one you learn
00:18:53.42 --> 00:18:56.62 and one you don't learn, but the actual fact is both these things you're going to learn.
00:18:57.74 --> 00:19:02.62 It's just a method of learning. One of them is one of them is study and one of them is doing.
00:19:03.90 --> 00:19:08.30 Yeah, it's almost seems like a small thing, but I don't think it's not. I mean, it's a big
00:19:08.30 --> 00:19:13.34 thing to understand the difference between those two is that if you were just training all the time
00:19:13.34 --> 00:19:17.90 and never really getting an education on what you're doing or studying or learning the bigger picture
00:19:17.90 --> 00:19:22.78 that training wouldn't be nearly as useful. You wouldn't learn as much. If you weren't
00:19:22.78 --> 00:19:26.78 educating yourself, why you're doing it, I know they talk more about it, but there's this idea
00:19:26.78 --> 00:19:31.66 like if I'm going to go to the rifle range and get really good at shooting the rifle,
00:19:31.66 --> 00:19:34.78 I could train on the rifle over and over and over again. I could do the same thing in
00:19:34.78 --> 00:19:39.18 airplane. I could train over and over again. But on the education comes from other components,
00:19:39.18 --> 00:19:43.50 like what the aircraft that I'm fighting against could do, what my enemies capable of, what the
00:19:43.50 --> 00:19:50.38 3D environment might be, and that training evolves because of the education. And if all I ever did
00:19:50.38 --> 00:19:54.46 was sort of think about what that looked like in 3D about a space and never trained for it,
00:19:54.46 --> 00:19:58.86 that education by itself, I wouldn't learn as much about doing the training with it.
00:19:58.86 --> 00:20:05.34 Yeah, yeah, no, I'm seeing it. I'm seeing it.
00:20:05.34 --> 00:20:07.34 Mm.
00:20:08.78 --> 00:20:13.98 Continuing on, Marines must always seek better ways to learn throughout the entire continuum
00:20:13.98 --> 00:20:18.78 of the training of training and education. Throughout this publication, the term learning is emphasized.
00:20:18.78 --> 00:20:23.82 Training and education are you specifically referring to one or the other. Learning is the
00:20:23.82 --> 00:20:30.94 overall intended outcome of both training and education. So there you go. Interesting, we. That must
00:20:30.94 --> 00:20:36.62 have been a little clogged thing in my brain for when I read this. Marines continuously learn
00:20:36.62 --> 00:20:41.82 to be ready for the constantly changing and increasing demands of warfare and the range of missions.
00:20:41.82 --> 00:20:47.34 As Marine Corps, doctrinal publication six command and control explains, we earn the trust of others
00:20:47.34 --> 00:20:52.06 by demonstrating competence, a sense of responsibility, loyalty, and self-discipline.
00:20:54.54 --> 00:20:57.82 We just talked about that on the last podcast, right? The number one way to
00:20:57.82 --> 00:21:05.26 to earn trust is competence. Think about that. We earn the trust of others by our own self-discipline.
00:21:09.58 --> 00:21:14.78 Competence is having sufficient knowledge, judgment, and skills to perform a particular duty
00:21:14.78 --> 00:21:20.14 job or function. Marines improve competencies through formal and informal learning opportunities
00:21:20.14 --> 00:21:24.70 that develop the required knowledge skills and attitudes. Marines learn to address complex
00:21:24.70 --> 00:21:30.22 problems and develop teamwork wherever they may be, whether in garrison deployed or in formal
00:21:30.22 --> 00:21:35.26 formal learning centers. Learning enables Marines to think critically, develop judgment,
00:21:35.26 --> 00:21:41.90 and cultivate a bias for action without waiting to be told what to do.
00:21:43.26 --> 00:21:48.70 The purpose learning enables Marines to think critically, develop judgment and cultivate a bias
00:21:48.70 --> 00:21:53.66 for action without waiting to be told what to do. That is such the opposite of what people think
00:21:53.66 --> 00:22:00.62 that the military is. Everyone thinks this is what we told what to do. And here, the actual words
00:22:00.62 --> 00:22:07.10 are don't wait to be told what to do is the actual words, a bias for action. A Marine with knowledge
00:22:07.10 --> 00:22:11.82 and skills who lack judgment requires close supervision, which may not be possible in combat
00:22:11.82 --> 00:22:17.74 conditions hence decentralized command. One, our Marine Corps ethos demands competence,
00:22:17.74 --> 00:22:21.90 responsibility, loyalty, and self-discipline as military professionals charge with the
00:22:21.90 --> 00:22:26.86 fence of the nation. Learning prepares Marines to exercise initiative within the commanders in
00:22:26.86 --> 00:22:32.38 tent, constantly seeking to improve developmental agility and deal with changing situations.
00:22:36.38 --> 00:22:41.82 Whoever was the guy writing this went out of his way to not just say discipline.
00:22:42.54 --> 00:22:47.18 Because I always think military, that's actually not what it is. That by itself is not enough.
00:22:47.18 --> 00:22:52.14 Yep, he's making it perfectly clear to everyone that we're not going to impose discipline
00:22:52.14 --> 00:22:55.02 on you. You need self-discipline. That's what you need.
00:22:58.46 --> 00:22:59.50 Decentralized command.
00:23:02.78 --> 00:23:07.42 Next section, the role of learning in war fighting maneuver warfare requires intelligent leaders
00:23:07.42 --> 00:23:12.06 at all levels who possess a bias for intelligent action. Oh, he just threw a little change
00:23:12.06 --> 00:23:16.14 at you. Yeah. And intelligent actions, not just action because we don't want you just to take
00:23:16.14 --> 00:23:21.10 action. We want you to do something smart. Success in land warfare depends on Marines developing
00:23:21.10 --> 00:23:25.82 an intellectual edge to accurately recognize cues, make sense of the information,
00:23:25.82 --> 00:23:31.34 and respond effectively. This intellectual edge is based on developed knowledge and experience
00:23:31.34 --> 00:23:36.46 that allows Marines to shape conditions and events to their advantage. Developing fundamental
00:23:36.46 --> 00:23:42.54 cognitive competencies such as problem framing, mental imaging, critical thinking, analysis,
00:23:42.54 --> 00:23:47.34 synthesis, reasoning, and problem solving enables Marines to make effective decisions more
00:23:47.34 --> 00:23:53.42 quickly in time constrained operational environments when they often have incomplete inaccurate
00:23:53.42 --> 00:24:03.02 or even contradictory information. There you go. And this is one of those, what I was reading
00:24:03.02 --> 00:24:09.50 this sentence yesterday, you are editing some of my work, maybe a couple of weeks ago. And you
00:24:09.50 --> 00:24:14.54 said, hey, you know this sentence that you wrote here, a lot in there, you used a lot of words here.
00:24:15.82 --> 00:24:20.38 Think about it. Maybe you could tighten this up. And I read it and I was like, yeah, I'm not typing.
00:24:20.38 --> 00:24:25.18 I said, you remember that one sentence you said, yeah, I said, I said, I didn't, I'm not changing.
00:24:26.62 --> 00:24:31.50 And when I read this sentence, I thought about that. I was like, well, could we have kind of
00:24:31.50 --> 00:24:36.30 made this a little bit more concise? But then I read it again. I thought to myself,
00:24:36.30 --> 00:24:41.34 no, this, every one of these, what would you take out? Yeah, what do you take out? What do you
00:24:41.34 --> 00:24:42.78 take out? What do you take out? What do you take out? What do you take out? Where you don't lose
00:24:44.14 --> 00:24:47.66 some level of meaning. And you know, this, this kind of sentence right here,
00:24:48.70 --> 00:24:52.22 you know, if you're a young Marine out there, that's that's reading this for the first time,
00:24:52.22 --> 00:24:57.98 you're going for a second. I didn't, you know, they didn't cover this and in, you know, junior,
00:24:58.38 --> 00:25:02.38 junior high school English, right? So you have to break it down a little bit. You have to go,
00:25:02.38 --> 00:25:07.42 what are they talking about? Develop, developing fundamental cognitive competencies. Okay, what does
00:25:07.42 --> 00:25:13.58 that mean? That means I need to be able to think about these things. Okay? What I need to be able to think
00:25:13.58 --> 00:25:19.10 about? I need to think about problem framing. What does that mean? It means assessing, looking at
00:25:19.10 --> 00:25:24.38 things in a certain way. Mental imaging. Okay, what do I see in those things? Critical thinking,
00:25:24.38 --> 00:25:29.66 are I now I need to think about them? I need to analyze those things. I need to synthesize,
00:25:29.66 --> 00:25:33.90 I need to take all those things and put them together. I need to reason through them and then I need
00:25:33.90 --> 00:25:38.78 to problem solve. Yeah. So that's, there's a lot going on there. Yeah, and those are just synonyms,
00:25:38.78 --> 00:25:44.22 it just repeat yourself. Those are different things. Yeah. And I was, I wrote, I got notes all throughout
00:25:44.22 --> 00:25:48.70 this thing. But obviously the Marine Corps, the title of this section is the role of learning
00:25:48.70 --> 00:25:52.14 and war fighting. Well, that's, that's cool because there's the Marine Corps, we're about war fighting.
00:25:52.14 --> 00:25:56.06 If you take out the word marine, take out the word war fighting. This is describing life.
00:25:56.06 --> 00:26:01.10 I want to talk about how is this applicable to my world? I have to make decisions when I don't
00:26:01.10 --> 00:26:06.70 have, when I have incomplete inaccurate or contradictory information. When don't you have that?
00:26:06.70 --> 00:26:10.54 War fighting, it's a no-brainer, but it's actually true everywhere. I mean, this thing is,
00:26:10.54 --> 00:26:13.50 it's written so clearly for any situation. Yeah.
00:26:16.86 --> 00:26:21.74 A central tentative maneuver warfare is attacking the enemies ability to make decisions and shift
00:26:21.74 --> 00:26:27.66 the mental aspects of warfare to the Marines' advantage. In short, Marines develop an intellectual
00:26:27.66 --> 00:26:33.02 edge by learning cognitive skills and competencies that enable them to move through the
00:26:33.02 --> 00:26:37.74 observe orient-decide and act cycle often referred to as the U-to-loop, more quickly and effectively
00:26:37.74 --> 00:26:43.18 than the enemy. The war fighter who recognizes what is happening adapts the situation and makes
00:26:43.18 --> 00:26:47.02 and then makes effective decisions in the shortest amount of time will typically have an advantage.
00:26:47.02 --> 00:26:52.86 The U-to-loop decision-making cycles even more important in preparation for future conflicts
00:26:52.86 --> 00:26:57.02 because as new technologies emerge, the rate of change will continue to increase.
00:26:57.02 --> 00:27:01.50 Therefore, Marines must continuously improve their knowledge and skills by leveraging
00:27:01.50 --> 00:27:10.46 technology but never depend upon technology alone as the solution. We're back to Colonel Boyd.
00:27:10.46 --> 00:27:19.18 Marine should observe their environment to recognize key cues, synthesize these cues to
00:27:19.18 --> 00:27:23.98 orient and quickly make sense of the information in order to decide and act and then Marines will
00:27:23.98 --> 00:27:32.14 start the cycle again as they observe the effects of their actions. So, you're a play chess.
00:27:32.14 --> 00:27:40.62 Yes. Are you good? No. But I can play. Okay. So, so you think you can take me? No.
00:27:40.62 --> 00:27:46.06 Okay. Check. You probably could. I don't know if I could chess play or not. I don't play chess.
00:27:46.06 --> 00:27:52.06 Okay. So, I know how to play but I don't play it. But I understand the game.
00:27:52.86 --> 00:27:58.54 So, one thing that's interesting about the game is and there's a great documentary about
00:27:58.54 --> 00:28:05.66 the current world champion in chess and I've freed his last name as first name as Magnus.
00:28:06.62 --> 00:28:09.90 Yeah. I watched it. I know it's talking. Yeah. Yeah. So, what's cool is
00:28:11.18 --> 00:28:16.14 and when I learned from watching that documentary is that when you're a good chess player,
00:28:16.14 --> 00:28:20.46 you're seeing patterns. You're just seeing chunks of the board and you can take all those pieces
00:28:20.46 --> 00:28:26.14 that are there and you understand the whole thing. And then the better you are, the more chunks
00:28:26.14 --> 00:28:29.26 you understand and the more you understand how they're going to play out. And it's the same thing.
00:28:29.26 --> 00:28:33.98 Now, when you take that and you look at, you know, if you look at Gigiitsu, like I see where your
00:28:33.98 --> 00:28:38.70 arm is and I know what that indicates, the three possibilities that you have and one of those
00:28:38.70 --> 00:28:42.06 possibilities isn't really a possibility because you also have your leg over here. So, that means two
00:28:42.06 --> 00:28:47.90 possibilities. And so, you can see these chunks. You can see things and you can react to it. And then,
00:28:47.90 --> 00:28:52.46 as you get good at reacting to seeing these chunks and get good at reacting to pattern recognition,
00:28:52.46 --> 00:28:58.86 what makes it so, what happens is you see pattern, you get pattern recognition.
00:29:00.94 --> 00:29:07.50 And what makes it easy isn't that you, it's not that I see a pattern and I see a pattern,
00:29:07.50 --> 00:29:10.38 I see a pattern, I see a pattern, I know what's doing, I know what's doing, too. That's easy. That's
00:29:10.38 --> 00:29:18.22 like level one. That's your white belt, fought process. But what makes it easy when you're operating
00:29:18.22 --> 00:29:23.02 a high level is you see the chunks, you see the patterns that you recognize and you know what's
00:29:23.02 --> 00:29:27.98 to do. But then you see a small outlier and you're able to recognize it. If you didn't know those
00:29:27.98 --> 00:29:31.66 patterns, you wouldn't recognize that outlier at all. As soon as you see that outliner, because all
00:29:31.66 --> 00:29:36.86 those chunks, those other pieces are where they are, you go, oh, outlier? I understand how that
00:29:36.86 --> 00:29:44.30 outlier fits into this whole picture and I can solve that problem. I can solve it a thousand times faster
00:29:44.30 --> 00:29:48.14 than someone that has to take all the different chunks and all these different things and put them
00:29:48.14 --> 00:29:54.78 together. So when we're training Marines or training humans, what we're trying to get good at is
00:29:54.78 --> 00:29:59.26 that whole process right there. And when I see something, I go, oh, this is what's happening. Okay,
00:29:59.26 --> 00:30:02.46 I see that, yeah, I'm going to do this and I see that, I'm going to do this. Oh, here, out of the
00:30:02.46 --> 00:30:07.66 five things that took me no thought whatsoever, I can solve those without even thinking, I know what
00:30:07.66 --> 00:30:12.54 to do. And then there's this one outlier thing that I see and I go, oh, that's the way that's different.
00:30:12.54 --> 00:30:17.10 And if I had to deal, if I had to deal with each of those five chunks in an individual basis and
00:30:17.10 --> 00:30:21.02 solve each one of those problems, I wouldn't even notice that outlier. I wouldn't even see it.
00:30:22.06 --> 00:30:27.82 But when I see it, when I recognize everything and I pattern recognition on five things or
00:30:27.82 --> 00:30:31.74 four out of five things that one thing that I don't recognize, I can focus my efforts on it and I can
00:30:31.74 --> 00:30:37.42 get it solved. And that's what you're trying to train leaders to do. Is recognize even,
00:30:37.42 --> 00:30:42.06 even when we talk about dealing with people, right, dealing with, you know, you're in a leadership
00:30:42.06 --> 00:30:47.82 position. Here's the nine different types of, you know, if you and I, if I say, I got to go talk to
00:30:47.82 --> 00:30:53.90 this guy who's, you know, has a bad temper and you and I'll roll plant. And there's eight things that
00:30:53.90 --> 00:30:57.90 will cover and I'll be like, yep, if he does this, if he does that, I'll do that. And then when I walk
00:30:57.90 --> 00:31:02.78 in and confront you about this or talk to you about this, seven of those things that you throw
00:31:02.78 --> 00:31:07.10 at me, I'm already ready for. And that means when you hit me with the one that I didn't expect,
00:31:07.10 --> 00:31:12.62 it's cool because I can just go, okay, I see what he's, I see what he is, I see what's happening.
00:31:12.62 --> 00:31:15.66 I have the other part, Tandel, and I can just focus on this one little thing right now,
00:31:15.66 --> 00:31:20.78 which is, I see what's happening. He's really committed to this part of his plan. Okay, cool.
00:31:20.78 --> 00:31:24.70 Hey, you know what, I think that one part of your plan, I think that's actually one of the
00:31:24.70 --> 00:31:30.86 better plans I've seen. And all of a sudden, I solve that thing. Which if I went into that room
00:31:30.86 --> 00:31:34.46 without recognizing the other patterns, I never would have even seen that outlier. Yeah.
00:31:34.46 --> 00:31:38.78 That's a really complex thing that I just tried to explain. How did I do? Echo, did I do it?
00:31:39.34 --> 00:31:46.46 Yeah, pretty good. Not that. Maybe this is just, maybe add to it. But yes, so you have the eight
00:31:46.46 --> 00:31:52.22 scenarios and, you know, nine scenarios out of the ten and whatever that you know, the one that you
00:31:52.62 --> 00:31:58.78 don't necessarily know. If you're thorough with the nine that you know, you know why you have
00:31:58.78 --> 00:32:03.42 the solutions, like the solutions are the solutions for these nine that you do know for reasons,
00:32:03.42 --> 00:32:07.50 right. So you know about all those reasons. So when that tenth one comes, you don't know the
00:32:07.50 --> 00:32:11.66 solution, but you know all the reasoning behind the other solutions and you apply those that reasoning. Yes.
00:32:11.66 --> 00:32:19.50 So I'm saying, so yes, I dig it. You're, you're talking about running, they reference this
00:32:19.50 --> 00:32:24.30 Udolup, which they do, the Marine Corps uses, I mean, boy, basically drove maneuver or warfare
00:32:24.30 --> 00:32:29.50 from the Marine Corps with that concept. But you're really talking about running Udolup with all
00:32:29.50 --> 00:32:33.98 these different loops at the same time and the real key is to find the one where the point of
00:32:33.98 --> 00:32:38.22 friction really is. And that's why if you're in our plane, this linear game, just you against me,
00:32:38.22 --> 00:32:44.78 and this one thing, it doesn't really make a difference. But if I'm running seven or eight and I recognize
00:32:44.78 --> 00:32:48.78 it, this is the one where the friction really is and you don't even, you have no clues even there.
00:32:48.78 --> 00:32:51.98 I'm not even worried about the other ones. Now, I need to keep up with those things. I can't ignore
00:32:51.98 --> 00:32:56.62 them, but I'm going to solve this thing and I'll be making decisions to maneuver this place where I want it
00:32:56.62 --> 00:32:59.90 and you won't even know that it's happening. That's how common you said, are you going to beat me
00:32:59.90 --> 00:33:04.30 in chess? I'm like, well, if you actually know how to play chess, I'm not going to beat you,
00:33:04.30 --> 00:33:09.34 because I'm actually sort of still displaying checkers. But you are off your solving this other problem
00:33:09.34 --> 00:33:12.62 that I'm not even paying attention to and you might have eight, nine, ten multiple Udolup
00:33:12.62 --> 00:33:16.38 to the same time of getting all these different things, but only you have to figure out the one that matters.
00:33:16.38 --> 00:33:20.78 And if I don't know what you're doing, I'm not even competing with you. I'm losing and I'll be no
00:33:20.78 --> 00:33:27.42 way. Yeah. And as I was talking about, we hear the other day. Yeah. I'm running Udolups on top. I'm
00:33:27.42 --> 00:33:32.22 running Udolups with Udolups inside it. Yeah. So it's like, here's four or five things that are going
00:33:32.22 --> 00:33:37.50 on, but there's a bigger thing that's going on outside of that. We got Udolups going on inside of
00:33:37.50 --> 00:33:42.54 Udolups and, and you can't do none of these things. You can't deal with the seven Udolups going
00:33:42.54 --> 00:33:47.90 on at the same time and identify the other one. You can't do Udolups within Udolups if you get caught
00:33:47.90 --> 00:33:52.62 up in those loops yourself. You got to be able to detach that back and the more that you train to
00:33:52.62 --> 00:33:59.34 do that, the easier it becomes to recognize these things, these outliers and you're able to focus
00:33:59.34 --> 00:34:07.34 your mind where you need to focus it and make decisions properly. Yep. And sometimes those cues are
00:34:07.34 --> 00:34:13.98 minuscule and subtle and you can almost unidentifiable, but if you've done it enough, oh yeah,
00:34:13.98 --> 00:34:22.06 if you have done it a lot, the more you do it, these things, these little tiny unnoticeable things,
00:34:22.06 --> 00:34:29.90 start to just look like just giant red flasks, so easy to see. And you go, there's the flank coming
00:34:29.90 --> 00:34:36.06 out me. Yep. I remember, Top Gunn, you do a lot of one against one, a lot of BFF. I kind of
00:34:36.06 --> 00:34:40.86 feels somewhat two-dimensional linear. It kind of is, but there's a million little cues that
00:34:40.86 --> 00:34:46.62 takes a lot of experience and I remember fighting with someone and probably halfway through the fight
00:34:47.58 --> 00:34:51.34 and debriefing kind of recognizing. This is the place here where I knew that these other things were
00:34:51.34 --> 00:34:54.22 no longer going to happen and this is going to happen. I maneuvered here, that's how I got behind
00:34:54.22 --> 00:34:58.78 you and killed you and said, how did you know this was going to happen here when I was, you know,
00:34:58.78 --> 00:35:02.54 five of those previous in the chess board and I'm like, well, look at across the horizon,
00:35:02.54 --> 00:35:06.06 you're leading edge flaps are kind of dug in a little bit lower than normal, which means you
00:35:06.06 --> 00:35:12.78 were at least between, I don't know, 220 and 240 knots. Let's go to your tape and it's 277 knots.
00:35:13.90 --> 00:35:18.54 And he's like, how, and I'm like, look, I'm not smarter than you, but I have seen that and I've
00:35:18.54 --> 00:35:22.78 looked for that and I noticed your three degrees above the horizon, which means you're going
00:35:22.78 --> 00:35:26.22 a little bit slower, which means you don't have these options anymore. I don't have to worry
00:35:26.22 --> 00:35:30.54 about you going up. So I'm making these decisions based on what and he doesn't even know those things
00:35:30.54 --> 00:35:35.58 are happening and it's like you said those cues, but after a while, those cues become so easy
00:35:35.58 --> 00:35:40.14 to see. Yeah, there's four or five Oedalooops that are going, you can throw them all, throw
00:35:40.14 --> 00:35:43.82 four from away the fifth one. Oh, yeah, here's where he's going next. Got it. And I'm going to be
00:35:43.82 --> 00:35:47.26 right here waiting for him. Totally. Good luck. I'm going to start maneuvering on this chess board.
00:35:47.26 --> 00:35:49.50 You don't even know what's happening and then you're going to make your move like I'm already
00:35:49.50 --> 00:35:56.78 set up to the point. Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. Next through progressive learning experience
00:35:56.78 --> 00:36:03.34 Marines at all levels develop a bias for action, enabled by adaptive rapid decision making. The
00:36:03.34 --> 00:36:09.82 more Marines learn and exercise this bias for action, the better it becomes. Once again, the more
00:36:09.82 --> 00:36:13.26 Marines learn and exercise this bias for action, the better becomes. And this is something that
00:36:13.82 --> 00:36:22.54 you know, on EF online last week, a guy said, hey, I'm not an aggressive leader. You know,
00:36:22.54 --> 00:36:29.66 what do I do? I'm not an aggressive leader. How do I get better? And I said, well, first of all,
00:36:29.66 --> 00:36:33.26 and I laid out the whole thing like when you're talking and we ended up covering a similar question
00:36:33.26 --> 00:36:37.10 on the podcast, which is like, hey, aggressive doesn't mean loudening your face. It doesn't mean
00:36:37.10 --> 00:36:42.86 getting crazy. Aggressive means you are making your taking action. It's aggressively pursuing action.
00:36:43.50 --> 00:36:47.90 And one of the things that I use is people say, how can I train someone to be more aggressive?
00:36:47.90 --> 00:36:52.22 It's real easy. You put them in situations where if they're not aggressive, they die.
00:36:53.74 --> 00:36:58.86 Or whatever metaphorical world you live in, hey, if you don't call the client, the client's going
00:36:58.86 --> 00:37:04.70 to blow up and you're going to lose the deal. If you don't solve this problem with your electrical
00:37:04.70 --> 00:37:09.82 system, that electrosystems going to fail, and it's going to be a disaster. So what you learn to do is
00:37:09.82 --> 00:37:12.94 go, okay, I'm not 100% sure what to do, but I'm going to do something right now and make something
00:37:12.94 --> 00:37:18.70 happen. And you must, I mean, this was super easy for me because I would put an element out in the
00:37:18.70 --> 00:37:22.62 field. There's, you know, there's some seals on us, alter a target and has there a
00:37:22.62 --> 00:37:29.10 something to target, you know, they'll have a single shooter now buying building. And they learn real
00:37:29.10 --> 00:37:33.66 quick if they do nothing cool, that guy's going to get his friends and he's going to kick their ass.
00:37:33.66 --> 00:37:37.82 And if they do something aggressive, they'll get that problem solved before it even really becomes
00:37:37.82 --> 00:37:44.46 a problem. So you can learn a bias for action. And that's how you learn it. And by the way,
00:37:44.46 --> 00:37:49.02 sometimes you, you do something aggressive and it doesn't work out the way you want it to.
00:37:49.02 --> 00:37:54.30 You're playing, you're playing a little bit, there's a gambling, right? There's a, there's an odds,
00:37:55.10 --> 00:38:00.22 there's odds to be played. And we covered this couple podcasts ago, you're playing the odds, right?
00:38:00.22 --> 00:38:06.62 And odds are seven out of ten times, your aggressive move is going to be the right move.
00:38:07.66 --> 00:38:12.30 Three out of ten times, maybe it wasn't the best move, but you, you got to play the odds.
00:38:12.30 --> 00:38:15.58 And that's also why we do it a revision making because just because I'm doing something aggressive
00:38:15.58 --> 00:38:19.34 doesn't mean that I go all in and sacrifice everything else. No, I make a small move in the
00:38:19.34 --> 00:38:23.58 direction that I think is right aggressively. And then I lead my feedback loop off of that.
00:38:27.18 --> 00:38:31.42 Continuing, although war games are training exercises, approximate the conditions of war,
00:38:31.42 --> 00:38:36.46 Marines cannot fully replicate the dangers complexities, emotions and friction of actual combat.
00:38:37.42 --> 00:38:41.26 Marines experience a variety of training situations that approximate combat situations,
00:38:41.26 --> 00:38:46.54 so that learned experiences can be remembered and applied during the stresses and friction of combat
00:38:47.82 --> 00:38:52.62 through both direct and indirect experiences and Marines develop a realistic appreciation
00:38:52.62 --> 00:38:58.70 for what is possible in combat and what is not. So one of the things that I used to tell guys,
00:38:59.42 --> 00:39:03.98 one of the failings of training for me when I was training, when I was running training,
00:39:03.98 --> 00:39:08.54 was we in paintball, we had laser guns to simulate, one thing that I could not simulate
00:39:08.54 --> 00:39:18.46 is fear of death because I couldn't do it with my trade at role players because they'd be like,
00:39:18.46 --> 00:39:21.34 hey, we're going to die, we're going to get some, and that's a little bit more realistic because
00:39:21.34 --> 00:39:25.42 you could say, hey, these are geologists and they don't care if they die cool. But the seals
00:39:26.86 --> 00:39:32.70 to say, like, you know, there's a downman in the middle of the street and in one second,
00:39:32.70 --> 00:39:39.50 there's four seals running out to save them. When those rounds are hitting, it's going to take a
00:39:39.50 --> 00:39:43.98 moment. You know, it's going to take some color fire, it's going to take a moment. So that's the
00:39:43.98 --> 00:39:49.10 one thing I would have a hard time simulating is, hey, you're going to be afraid. And even if
00:39:49.10 --> 00:39:54.70 you're not afraid, two of the guys, three of the guys that are with you are going to be afraid,
00:39:54.70 --> 00:39:57.50 are not going to want to step into that alleyway, they're not going to step away into the street
00:39:57.50 --> 00:40:02.06 or whatever. And so you got to calculate for that. So I would try and get people to behave as if,
00:40:02.62 --> 00:40:10.54 you know, you do this, you, you die. When I read this, I was thinking of a story, you've told me,
00:40:10.86 --> 00:40:17.10 you tell the story a lot is a story about stoner in his first combat mission. And you go to the
00:40:17.10 --> 00:40:20.38 story, what happens in the guy after the thing is that the the Battalion Commander, the Hewzer
00:40:20.38 --> 00:40:26.86 is working, it's like man, there was a mid team leader, a mid team major, he was a major in the mid team,
00:40:26.86 --> 00:40:33.42 which by the way, just real quick, mid team that meant he had been, you know, in in Ramadi for five
00:40:33.42 --> 00:40:37.02 months getting in gun fights. But yeah, totally. And just the point where he's like, hey, man,
00:40:38.46 --> 00:40:42.62 obviously you've been in a ton of these experiences and kind of, and you're like, actually Seth was like,
00:40:42.62 --> 00:40:46.70 no, it was my first time. But even like, I was even looking at the little things like this training
00:40:46.70 --> 00:40:52.70 approximate combat situations. They were smart enough to not say replicates or is it's not the same.
00:40:52.70 --> 00:40:57.02 But it's just enough to get you to be prepared for what you're going to see. And actually if you do it,
00:40:57.02 --> 00:41:01.90 well, you can't make it perfect. But if you do it well, that's exactly how people respond in that
00:41:01.90 --> 00:41:06.30 most chaotic thing, which was exactly what happened to Stoner. No, yeah, it's and I would have
00:41:06.30 --> 00:41:10.30 guys all the time come back and say, oh yeah, thanks for the training. Because it was as good as it gets.
00:41:10.30 --> 00:41:19.34 Totally fast forward a little bit. Marines need to develop the memory skills
00:41:20.54 --> 00:41:25.42 because Marines as human beings increasingly tend to digitally store and search for information
00:41:25.42 --> 00:41:29.74 rather than committing information to short-term or long-term memory. Marines cannot always rely on
00:41:29.74 --> 00:41:34.14 technologies or on being able to digitally search for information during combat due to many
00:41:34.14 --> 00:41:39.66 reasons such as time constraints, lack of network access or the need to minimize electronic
00:41:39.66 --> 00:41:44.46 segmentures. Therefore, Marines at all levels need to train their minds to memorize and recall
00:41:44.46 --> 00:41:48.78 important information to reflect upon that knowledge, to develop understanding and to frequently
00:41:48.78 --> 00:41:53.10 exercise these skills through training so that information could be recalled and stinktively
00:41:53.10 --> 00:42:01.26 during combat. And I forgot to mention that yes, I am skipping forward through some of this
00:42:01.26 --> 00:42:05.74 information. But you know, it's just because we're not going to do it. We're going to try not to do
00:42:05.74 --> 00:42:10.86 this 17 hour podcast on this one manual. I was wondering how are you going to not read the whole
00:42:10.86 --> 00:42:14.78 part. I was wondering it too, especially in the opening when you're just going, okay, this whole thing.
00:42:14.78 --> 00:42:20.62 Totally. This whole thing is good. Next section key principles of learning.
00:42:23.10 --> 00:42:26.94 The first learning principle is know yourself and seek self-improvement.
00:42:28.14 --> 00:42:35.18 A Marines mindset values ethics and experiences impact his or her learning decisions
00:42:35.18 --> 00:42:44.78 and actions. Once again, sorry Sam Harris. We do have free will or at least Marines on the
00:42:44.78 --> 00:42:50.06 battlefield Sam Harris have free will to make decisions and take actions based on the impact of
00:42:50.06 --> 00:42:55.02 their learning based on their mindset, based on their values based on their ethics, based on their
00:42:55.02 --> 00:43:01.82 experiences. Fast forward a little bit when Marines are aware of how perspectives and experiences
00:43:01.82 --> 00:43:06.94 shape their thinking. They can better identify assumptions, biases, and other factors that influence
00:43:06.94 --> 00:43:12.86 learning. Previous experiences are valuable for many reasons, such as providing personalized
00:43:12.86 --> 00:43:17.90 references to integrate new knowledge, skills and experience in the memory. Marines learn in
00:43:17.90 --> 00:43:23.58 fight effectively despite friction, which has been described as the force in war that makes
00:43:23.58 --> 00:43:30.94 the apparently easy, so difficult. Learning is not always easy. A lack of self-awareness,
00:43:30.94 --> 00:43:38.30 emotional regulation, humility, time management, or biases can cause friction that makes learning
00:43:38.30 --> 00:43:43.98 more difficult. Yeah, check it out. If you're not self-aware, if you can't regulate your emotions,
00:43:43.98 --> 00:43:47.66 if you're not humble, if you don't have good time management, or if you have biases,
00:43:47.66 --> 00:43:54.46 you're going to be hard to learn. Which are all natural things, by the way. Which are all natural
00:43:54.46 --> 00:43:59.42 things, which are all things that we kind of every, by naturalizing me mean like that's where we
00:43:59.42 --> 00:44:05.90 tend. Yes. We tend to lack self-awareness. We tend to not be able to control our emotions. We tend
00:44:05.90 --> 00:44:10.62 to lack humility. We tend not to be able to do time management. We tend to have biases.
00:44:10.62 --> 00:44:17.74 Yeah, thank you all, correct. I go to Charles. Marines overcome this friction and seek
00:44:17.74 --> 00:44:21.74 self-improvement by better understanding themselves, particularly how our values ethics and
00:44:21.74 --> 00:44:27.26 perspectives influence the learning. And now I think it's important to remember that when we're
00:44:27.26 --> 00:44:31.02 talking about learning in that context right there, I'm talking about hey, what I learned from this
00:44:31.02 --> 00:44:36.62 class or this training, it's what am I learning on the battlefield? What am I seeing and how are my
00:44:36.62 --> 00:44:43.82 biases negatively impacting how I'm able to take on this new information and adapt to it?
00:44:43.82 --> 00:44:50.62 Because that's what happens. You know, you have this idea in your head of how things should be
00:44:51.50 --> 00:44:56.14 and therefore when the enemy does something you don't expect you, you don't accept it. You act
00:44:56.14 --> 00:45:01.90 like it happened in a different way. They couldn't, they just got lucky. You make excuses for yourself,
00:45:01.90 --> 00:45:08.62 you make excuses for the enemy, they got lucky. They can't do that again. Those are your biases,
00:45:08.62 --> 00:45:16.30 preventing you from learning. I mean, we must have, we did that like crazy in Iraq. We as a
00:45:16.30 --> 00:45:21.18 country, right? Oh, they can't be, this can't be an organized campaign. So just, there's just some
00:45:21.18 --> 00:45:26.30 rattle browsers out there. But we just wouldn't accept it. This isn't an insert and these are just some
00:45:26.30 --> 00:45:31.66 outpoggots. I'll be drawing some discruntled folks around here. I fast forward a year and a half,
00:45:31.66 --> 00:45:37.74 two years. We got a full fledged insert as he on our hands. What's a rattle browser? Some of that just causes problems.
00:45:41.90 --> 00:45:45.90 Second principle, the second learning principle is be ready and willing to learn.
00:45:45.90 --> 00:45:55.10 You wouldn't think you'd have to say that. Yeah, but you do without a doubt. Even that first one of
00:45:55.10 --> 00:46:00.22 know yourself and seek self improvement, it seems like that would be a natural tendency to do that.
00:46:00.22 --> 00:46:05.66 It's actually not your ego. At some point, it gives like you don't need to keep learning. You
00:46:05.66 --> 00:46:10.94 don't need to get better. You don't need to improve. And the reason it's in there is that not only
00:46:10.94 --> 00:46:16.70 is it natural, like you were saying, that is an overwhelming powerful force. Your own ego telling
00:46:16.70 --> 00:46:24.46 you, bro, you've got this thing figured out. Yeah, you know, know yourself. Yeah, yeah. Who knows
00:46:24.46 --> 00:46:29.58 me better than myself? Right? It's over there, quote, Sun Siu, better one, echo Charles. No,
00:46:29.58 --> 00:46:34.70 well, I'm just saying you said it in there. So you ever seen your set well? You're probably different,
00:46:34.70 --> 00:46:42.54 but us normal people, we sometimes will see ourselves on camera or hear our own voice on in a
00:46:42.54 --> 00:46:47.02 recording and be like, oh my gosh, you can't believe I sound like that. Meanwhile, you know who
00:46:47.02 --> 00:46:52.06 listens to your voice 100% of the time you yet. You still don't really know yourself because when
00:46:52.06 --> 00:46:56.78 you see it kind of, you know, detached from you doing it in the moment, it seems different for
00:46:56.78 --> 00:47:03.90 Sunri then. Isn't that weird? So we kind of don't know ourselves, I think. Yeah, I would say there's
00:47:03.90 --> 00:47:07.74 very few people that when they hear themselves, they go, yep, that's what I sound like. Yeah,
00:47:07.74 --> 00:47:12.78 especially at first, after a while, you know, yeah, you get used to it or whatever, but at the end of
00:47:12.78 --> 00:47:18.14 day, that's a common thing. I think for people where they see themselves and or they hear
00:47:18.14 --> 00:47:22.46 themselves and they're like, oh, and there for some reason moved by it in one way or another,
00:47:22.46 --> 00:47:26.38 you know, like they haven't been with themselves their whole life kind of thing. You know,
00:47:26.38 --> 00:47:29.90 like it's some kind of weird surprise or something like that. So it's kind of like, no, you don't
00:47:29.90 --> 00:47:36.46 really know yourself. I think you for the most part anyway, like you experience little little
00:47:36.46 --> 00:47:41.26 slivers of yourself while you're behaving and then you kind of paint your own picture. Like,
00:47:41.26 --> 00:47:45.10 oh, I just said that I must have sounded real cool saying that. I mean, while you hear a
00:47:45.10 --> 00:47:50.70 played back, you like dang it and it's a little. Yeah, those are those are valid. You know what's
00:47:50.70 --> 00:47:54.46 interesting about this section right here. So we start off saying, now, you know, this is,
00:47:54.46 --> 00:47:57.50 this is, what's good about the ring course? You know, this is taking a Lance Corp on Canary
00:47:57.50 --> 00:48:04.38 this and and Gunny Sergeant can read this and a Colonel can read this and they all can like understand it.
00:48:04.38 --> 00:48:10.22 Here's what's interesting about this. This section right here, believe it or not, in my humble opinion,
00:48:10.22 --> 00:48:16.14 is actually aimed at the Colonel because the Lance Corp was like, hey, brah I'm here to learn.
00:48:16.14 --> 00:48:21.98 Yeah, I got my mind is wide open. It's the Colonel and the Gunny or the Master Guns,
00:48:21.98 --> 00:48:29.18 that's like I already got this or already have this depending if it's the Gunny or the
00:48:29.18 --> 00:48:33.58 Colonel or the Colonel. Yeah, because the minute that you think you know everything
00:48:34.78 --> 00:48:39.10 is the minute that you are not ready and willing to learn and that's when you're going backwards.
00:48:39.10 --> 00:48:43.90 So this section right here, they actually aimed this section point blank
00:48:45.34 --> 00:48:49.82 at this, the senior people that think they know because those those young kids man, they're
00:48:49.82 --> 00:48:53.34 ready to learn. They're not sitting there going on, you know this. I mean, it's like a new guy in a
00:48:53.34 --> 00:48:59.98 seal put in. That guy's that kid's ready to learn. But once you're a senior and listed guy or you're
00:48:59.98 --> 00:49:03.90 a more senior officer, all of a sudden you know anything, you know everything.
00:49:07.74 --> 00:49:11.10 Marines have the professional responsibility to learn throughout their careers and should always
00:49:11.10 --> 00:49:14.86 seek opportunities to learn. Marines must take an active role in learning, be intellectually
00:49:14.86 --> 00:49:21.34 curious and look for new ways to adapt when they have learned to adapt what they learn to other
00:49:21.34 --> 00:49:25.98 relevant situations. There are many factors that indicate a person's willingness and readiness to
00:49:25.98 --> 00:49:31.02 learn such physical, behavioral, societal, emotional, and cognitive skills. Additionally, humility,
00:49:31.02 --> 00:49:35.42 courage, integrity, perseverance, motivation, and discipline are other key qualities that affect the
00:49:35.42 --> 00:49:43.90 learning readiness. What's the number one humility? Interesting courage is number two. Why is that?
00:49:43.90 --> 00:49:48.94 Because what kind of person just says, you know, I already got this. Right? Or they don't have the
00:49:48.94 --> 00:49:52.86 courage to raise your hand. That's what I should have said. The person that humbless not humble says,
00:49:52.86 --> 00:49:56.62 you know, I already got this. The person that lacks courage won't go, hey, you know what,
00:49:56.62 --> 00:50:00.70 a boss, you know what, I don't really understand this. Can you can you tell me this again? That
00:50:00.70 --> 00:50:04.86 takes courage. You're in a group of people, raise your hand. Man, when I was going to college and I was
00:50:04.86 --> 00:50:11.26 a 20, whatever year old man going to college with a bunch of 18 year olds, I had, I had a
00:50:11.26 --> 00:50:15.66 preponderance of moral courage. The front of the classroom, I'd be like, a professor, I don't understand
00:50:15.66 --> 00:50:21.50 that. Can you go over that again? Yeah. And it made me so much do so much better because, you know,
00:50:21.50 --> 00:50:24.06 I guarantee this kids in the back of class, they don't understand something. They're not going to say
00:50:24.06 --> 00:50:28.70 anything and look stupid. I didn't care. Yeah. So you have that courage integrity, perseverance,
00:50:28.70 --> 00:50:33.26 motivation and discipline. Starts with humility and with discipline. I like this book.
00:50:35.18 --> 00:50:39.66 Marines increase their learning readiness by having courage, perseverance and discipline to
00:50:39.66 --> 00:50:43.82 continuously seek new professional knowledge skills and experiences. A Marines learning can be
00:50:43.82 --> 00:50:48.30 facilitated by developing an awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes.
00:50:49.02 --> 00:50:54.78 Marine sharpen their intellect by studying how to think better than applying these skills to improve
00:50:54.78 --> 00:51:03.50 as learners, leaders and decision makers. The third principle is to understand why you are learning.
00:51:04.14 --> 00:51:07.66 And this is what's key. What you can take away from this. Hey, look, apply this to yourself.
00:51:07.66 --> 00:51:14.14 For sure, apply it to your kids, apply it to your students, apply it to the people that you work with.
00:51:14.14 --> 00:51:18.22 You want to make sure everyone understands why they're learning, especially the kids. Like, yeah,
00:51:18.22 --> 00:51:23.66 for you absolutely apply it, but as an instructor, you can you can reverse engineer this as an
00:51:23.66 --> 00:51:29.58 instructor and you lead with why something is important to know. And that will help people open their
00:51:29.58 --> 00:51:36.38 brains. When Marines understand why they are learning concepts and skills, they better understand
00:51:36.38 --> 00:51:39.42 the importance of learning to the mission and are more motivated to learn.
00:51:40.78 --> 00:51:44.78 By understanding the context of learning, Marines are better able to apply concepts and skills,
00:51:44.78 --> 00:51:49.42 new situations, increasing their confidence in that adaptability. Unknowns, uncertainty and
00:51:49.42 --> 00:51:54.94 disorder will never be eliminated in battle. Information may be unclear, misinterpreted,
00:51:54.94 --> 00:51:59.82 influenced by the enemy or communication systems may fail. When Marines understand why they
00:51:59.82 --> 00:52:05.18 are learning, it enables them to focus on learning of the known and adapting to the familiar
00:52:05.18 --> 00:52:12.14 and adapting to the unfamiliar more quickly and effectively than the enemy. That's the outlier thing
00:52:12.14 --> 00:52:17.58 we just talked about. Yeah. I see all the things that you're doing. I see the nine pattern
00:52:17.58 --> 00:52:22.14 recognitions. There's the one outlier I'm on it. Outlearning the enemy, therefore, it's key
00:52:22.14 --> 00:52:31.42 outfitting the enemy. That's a big deal. Outlearning the enemy is the key to outfining. Not the
00:52:31.42 --> 00:52:36.30 brute force, not getting bigger equipment or stronger things. It's outlearning it. That's how you're
00:52:36.30 --> 00:52:42.70 going to win. Yeah. When you start to look at learning as a skill that's required for battle,
00:52:43.66 --> 00:52:49.42 you start to look at it different. Yes. Totally. And then you could start breaking down. How am I
00:52:49.42 --> 00:52:56.38 going to go about learning? What am I paying attention to? How do I assess things that I'm hearing?
00:52:56.38 --> 00:53:03.82 How do I assemble all that knowledge together? There's a lot that goes into it. Dude, there's a ton
00:53:03.82 --> 00:53:10.14 and if I wasn't around when somebody decided we need to put a doctrinal pub around learning
00:53:10.14 --> 00:53:15.50 for the Marine Corps. But it's a really good idea. And it probably came from someone who was like
00:53:15.50 --> 00:53:21.18 me that as a second lieutenant who had a pile of things that I was supposed to learn when I got to
00:53:21.18 --> 00:53:26.86 the Basics School and they gave me all these same pubs, warfitting, tactics, strategy. And learning
00:53:26.86 --> 00:53:32.94 to me was I'm going to read this and find the answers in these books so I can take the test and
00:53:32.94 --> 00:53:38.46 pass and be really good. And I'm going to learn what the answers are, which is totally wrong,
00:53:38.46 --> 00:53:42.86 totally different. And the sooner the force, any organization figures out how to crack the code
00:53:42.86 --> 00:53:48.62 and getting people to actually want to do this for their own self-interest, the better. And I'm
00:53:48.62 --> 00:53:52.54 sure that that's a driver behind this as a generation of people going, I'm learning what the answers
00:53:52.54 --> 00:53:56.62 are and that is not learning. That is not an effective way to do. And that's partly the reason
00:53:56.62 --> 00:54:00.54 I'm mad as is so credible because the things he talked about more than anything, he doesn't talk
00:54:00.54 --> 00:54:05.50 about combat nearly as much as he talks about all the preparation he did and all the things that he
00:54:05.50 --> 00:54:10.86 read and that's what people figured out about mad as is what made him brilliant was how much he
00:54:10.86 --> 00:54:17.98 he read and studied. And each time he read and studied he got a little bit of pattern recognition
00:54:17.98 --> 00:54:22.94 understood things better. Kind of a little smarter. Got a little bit smarter. Learned. Yes.
00:54:25.74 --> 00:54:30.46 Second Lieutenant Burke didn't learn nearly as much as he showed out. Yeah, you know and that's one
00:54:30.46 --> 00:54:35.02 of the things you know on the thread podcast, you know, I talk about the fact that everything's
00:54:35.02 --> 00:54:38.86 connected and when things aren't when you don't make the connections between things, it'd be like
00:54:38.86 --> 00:54:42.86 if you started taking you to a people like, okay this is the armlock. You're going to learn
00:54:42.86 --> 00:54:47.18 that in the armlock room and then you go into another room with another instructor and they teach
00:54:47.18 --> 00:54:52.54 you the triangle and then you go to another room with another instructor and they teach you the sweep.
00:54:54.38 --> 00:54:58.30 All those things by themselves, they're not meaningless but they have,
00:54:59.34 --> 00:55:06.54 they low value. Very low value, comparatively speaking. So that was the original idea of the thread
00:55:06.54 --> 00:55:18.38 podcast was listen. People don't connect everything and everything's connected. Connect things.
00:55:19.18 --> 00:55:24.78 The fourth learning principle is to provide and receive constructive feedback. One cannot learn
00:55:24.78 --> 00:55:30.54 without feedback. It is critical to learning and developing adaptability. There are two sources of
00:55:30.54 --> 00:55:39.66 feedback. Intrinsic sources, IE internal and extrinsic sources, IE external. For example, a Marine's own
00:55:39.66 --> 00:55:43.50 perception that he or she jerked the trigger when shooting a rifle, then adjusting the trigger
00:55:43.50 --> 00:55:48.06 pull on the next shot would be an example of intrinsic feedback. In this same example,
00:55:48.06 --> 00:55:52.38 extrinsic feedback would be a marksman stripping structure, marksman stripping structure identifying
00:55:52.38 --> 00:55:57.42 their error in the two the Marine, then demonstrating the proper trigger pull. Both intrinsic
00:55:57.42 --> 00:56:02.22 and extrinsic feedback are important for learning and developing adaptability. Adaptability is
00:56:02.22 --> 00:56:06.54 the quality of being able to adjust the new conditions. Marine's develop adaptability when they
00:56:06.54 --> 00:56:11.50 examine a situation, recognize what is happening and adjust their response to the new conditions.
00:56:11.50 --> 00:56:19.34 The process of learning is itself a form of adaptive behavior and is essential element of combat
00:56:19.34 --> 00:56:20.06 effectiveness.
00:56:20.06 --> 00:56:34.86 Check. The final principle is that learning is purpose-driven to develop professional
00:56:34.86 --> 00:56:40.86 competence. Learning has specific goals and measurable objectives to gauge progress toward
00:56:40.86 --> 00:56:47.98 developing competencies. Marine learning is team-oriented so that Marines develop the skills and
00:56:47.98 --> 00:56:56.06 connections to fight collectively. Additionally, Marine's study history and world events to be
00:56:56.06 --> 00:57:01.58 more prepared to respond to new challenges such as the increase in globalization and competition
00:57:01.58 --> 00:57:06.78 for resources. Effective war fighters adapt to fluid changes in circumstances in order to deal
00:57:06.78 --> 00:57:10.30 with complex problems and to proactively shape events for advantage.
00:57:10.30 --> 00:57:17.90 Marine sometimes conceptualize the enemy and or adversary as a single person or group of people,
00:57:18.70 --> 00:57:21.42 but should be viewed as a complex system.
00:57:28.46 --> 00:57:36.94 Obviously, Marine study history and world events and that's one of the most awesome things that
00:57:36.94 --> 00:57:42.14 happens to me when I travel and meet Marines around the country and around the world is
00:57:43.26 --> 00:57:47.42 a lot of Marines listen to this podcast so that they have a better understanding of war
00:57:47.42 --> 00:57:55.26 in context of history. By listening, they're fulfilling, at least in some part,
00:57:55.26 --> 00:58:04.70 fulfilling this and what's really cool is when someone sends me a picture of 12 books from the podcast
00:58:04.70 --> 00:58:08.86 that they ordered in red and now they haven't even more in depth knowledge of things.
00:58:11.90 --> 00:58:18.38 There's a lot in here, man. This idea of adapting to fluid changes in circumstances in order
00:58:18.38 --> 00:58:22.46 to deal with complex problems and proactively shape events for an advantage.
00:58:23.82 --> 00:58:27.82 That's the core of every question we've been asked at echelon front for the last month.
00:58:27.82 --> 00:58:32.70 In this complex fluid environment that nobody anticipated and nobody expected to happen
00:58:32.70 --> 00:58:38.54 and what are they going to do to proactively shape the outcome rather than just be a victim of it
00:58:38.54 --> 00:58:44.06 on how this thing plays out. What do I need to do to shape the outcome? What do I need to take control of?
00:58:44.06 --> 00:58:47.82 And if you don't have a long history of learning how to deal with these type of settings,
00:58:47.82 --> 00:58:54.86 you're going to have a really hard time. And it's nice to bring that word shape in as opposed to
00:58:54.86 --> 00:58:57.98 what can I do to control the outcome? Because that's what you can't control the outcome.
00:58:57.98 --> 00:59:02.14 The outcome is going to come. How can you shape it?
00:59:02.14 --> 00:59:04.30 The teacher's advantage. Absolutely.
00:59:05.98 --> 00:59:09.34 Next section, the human dimension and science of learning.
00:59:10.94 --> 00:59:18.46 Conflict is a human phenomena. Understanding human nature helps Marines to understand conflict.
00:59:18.46 --> 00:59:27.34 Marine's prepare for the complexities of each conflict by studying social, economic,
00:59:27.34 --> 00:59:31.58 political, cultural, environmental, interpersonal and intrapersonal factors.
00:59:32.30 --> 00:59:36.14 You got to know human beings. How many times have I said that on this podcast? Echo Charles.
00:59:36.14 --> 00:59:39.14 I want a number. 86, something.
00:59:39.14 --> 00:59:40.14 70,000.
00:59:40.14 --> 00:59:40.70 Thanks.
00:59:41.90 --> 00:59:48.22 These factors often exert a greater influence on this character and outcome of war.
00:59:48.22 --> 00:59:52.54 Then do factors such as the size of the enemy formations and their equipment.
00:59:54.38 --> 00:59:57.58 To all these things, human nature has a bigger influence.
00:59:58.30 --> 01:00:01.42 Oftentimes, then the size of the enemy formations or their equipment.
01:00:02.38 --> 01:00:06.30 We're talking about just human nature. And that's why leadership is always the most important thing.
01:00:06.30 --> 01:00:07.58 Leadership is a human endeavor.
01:00:08.70 --> 01:00:12.94 You can have the best and the most equipment in the world. And if you have bad leadership, if you don't
01:00:12.94 --> 01:00:17.26 understand your people, you're going to lose. You're going to lose against the person
01:00:17.26 --> 01:00:20.54 who is better-led and better understands a human components that you're dealing with.
01:00:20.54 --> 01:00:23.66 That's really the comment you made earlier. Those are human things.
01:00:23.66 --> 01:00:27.74 Yeah, I even wrote that down. Leadership is also a human endeavor.
01:00:30.62 --> 01:00:31.90 Marine's, go.
01:00:31.90 --> 01:00:34.62 As is a able wrote down, this is huge and underlying that.
01:00:38.06 --> 01:00:43.50 Marines learn as much as possible about the different human factors, cultures, perspectives,
01:00:43.50 --> 01:00:47.34 and ideas that impact operations, developing self-awareness of the personal factors that can
01:00:47.34 --> 01:00:54.86 detract from learning, such as hubris, ego, bias, enables Marines to overcome friction.
01:00:54.86 --> 01:00:58.78 Marine strived to view situations in information objectively and unemotionally,
01:00:58.78 --> 01:01:03.58 provide candid feedback to each other and learn to overcome or mitigate factors that negatively
01:01:03.58 --> 01:01:04.62 impact preparedness.
01:01:08.30 --> 01:01:10.22 Yes, yes, and yes.
01:01:10.22 --> 01:01:18.06 Yes, ego, bias, bring us down.
01:01:24.30 --> 01:01:28.46 Marine strived to view situations in information objectively and unemotionally,
01:01:30.94 --> 01:01:37.02 and provide candid feedback to each other and learn to overcome or mitigate factors that negatively
01:01:37.02 --> 01:01:45.10 impact preparedness. Reason I'm rehashing that one is because sometimes people utilize the candid
01:01:45.10 --> 01:01:50.94 feedback thing, but they forget about ego and hubris of the other person.
01:01:52.14 --> 01:01:56.22 So when I'm just going to give you some candid feedback, there are echo trials.
01:01:57.42 --> 01:01:58.94 When I forget about is that you have an ego.
01:02:00.22 --> 01:02:03.98 And so by giving you this candid feedback that you're not really prepared to receive,
01:02:03.98 --> 01:02:08.38 you're going to get defensive, the whole nine yards, you're not going to make any changes.
01:02:08.38 --> 01:02:14.06 Whereas if I can find a way to use maneuver or fair around that ego and provide you with feedback
01:02:14.06 --> 01:02:18.70 that somehow comes from your own brain because a seed's been planted by me, it's going to be better off.
01:02:22.30 --> 01:02:24.78 Throw a little bone to the Marine Corps on that one.
01:02:25.34 --> 01:02:29.34 Just take your thought process a little bit further on that one.
01:02:29.34 --> 01:02:35.42 Yes, Dave, little bit more. Just can we go a little bit? Can we apply what we're talking about
01:02:35.42 --> 01:02:45.58 just a little bit more and be a little bit better? Candid feedback is awesome. When
01:02:46.78 --> 01:02:54.62 there is this level of relationships and then ego, ego has been put in check, it works.
01:02:54.62 --> 01:03:01.18 And then we strive for that. It's hard to achieve. Unemotional, unemotional, candid feedback.
01:03:01.82 --> 01:03:09.02 Because how many people do you know really are geared to absorb candid feedback in an unemotional manner,
01:03:09.02 --> 01:03:11.58 especially after something like preparation for the theater?
01:03:12.78 --> 01:03:18.54 What I wrote about that later, subtracted the entire kick. I tried to help the person on the receiving end.
01:03:19.10 --> 01:03:23.82 I'm like, listen, when somebody gives you criticism, even if it's coming from someone
01:03:23.82 --> 01:03:29.26 that you think has no business giving you any feedback whatsoever, listen to them.
01:03:30.54 --> 01:03:34.94 And absorb what they say and see if you can apply it to make yourself better.
01:03:34.94 --> 01:03:39.82 And that right there, that little learning to do that as a human being. If you could learn to do that,
01:03:39.82 --> 01:03:44.86 as a human being, your life is going to be a thousand times better than it would if you never get
01:03:44.86 --> 01:03:48.70 over that hump of a, I don't like this guy, so I'm not going to listen what he has to say.
01:03:48.70 --> 01:03:52.94 Where is someone that just opened? This is you know what? And this is to your point, Dave,
01:03:52.94 --> 01:04:00.30 how many people have I met in my entire life? That were just, oh, hit me with some more candid
01:04:00.30 --> 01:04:07.66 feedback so I can just get better. Do they exist? Sure, do we get to a point? Do do sometimes people,
01:04:08.46 --> 01:04:12.46 you know, I have a relationship with someone or go, you know, someone I was putting someone
01:04:12.46 --> 01:04:14.94 through training, I could just tell like, I'm saying something, they're going to have their
01:04:14.94 --> 01:04:18.38 know, but if you're like, hey, I got it, you know, that's a great point. Thank you. Sure, if that happens,
01:04:18.38 --> 01:04:25.18 for sure, it doesn't happen all the time. It doesn't happen most of the time. Does it say
01:04:25.18 --> 01:04:31.18 unimotional candid feedback? Yes, it's a, it says, Marine strive to view situations and information
01:04:31.18 --> 01:04:36.70 objectively and unimotionally provide candid feedback to each other and learn to overcome or mitigate
01:04:36.70 --> 01:04:43.66 factors that negatively impact preparedness. Yeah, so I guess overall, it's provide and accept
01:04:43.66 --> 01:04:49.82 any emotional. So even the unimotional kind of feedback that might, that, um, so you know how
01:04:50.54 --> 01:04:54.62 in a typical situation, I don't know, typical, what I don't even know what that even means, but
01:04:54.94 --> 01:05:00.22 a situation where you're like, hey, candid feedback in the guy kind of takes it as the, as the,
01:05:00.22 --> 01:05:06.70 the golden past to just just basically hit him as hard as he can, like, yeah, this method was straight
01:05:06.70 --> 01:05:11.02 up dog shit, you know, like that's not unimotional. That's emotional feedback right there,
01:05:11.02 --> 01:05:15.34 seem saying, like it's on the other side, it's on the negative emotion rather than, oh, you know,
01:05:15.34 --> 01:05:19.66 you could have done better, you know, it's, I mean, maybe it's candid, but you're right,
01:05:19.66 --> 01:05:24.46 and so I'm going to take this one more, one more step for the next release of this.
01:05:24.46 --> 01:05:30.14 We're going to talk about this. The reason when they revise this, when we talk about candid
01:05:30.14 --> 01:05:36.62 feedback, we also need to talk about human nature, right? Because human nature is, I bristle at
01:05:36.62 --> 01:05:42.06 candid feedback. And like I said, are there people that don't, and the goal here, the ideal goal is,
01:05:42.06 --> 01:05:44.62 like, hey, I'm a Marine, you're a Marine. I'm going to give you some candid feedback, you're going
01:05:44.62 --> 01:05:48.46 to take it on board, we're going to move forward. I get it, man, I love that. I wish that the way the
01:05:48.46 --> 01:05:53.34 world works. We have to remember human nature. We have to remember that human nature
01:05:55.66 --> 01:06:01.50 provides a level of resistance against candid feedback. I'm sorry. Yeah, and they, and they,
01:06:01.50 --> 01:06:04.78 they touch on it. They kind of talk about it a little bit, but they don't really get to the
01:06:04.78 --> 01:06:08.38 core of here is the real barrier you're going to get when you're dealing with this. Now, the good
01:06:08.38 --> 01:06:12.22 news is that anybody listening to this podcast is already listening to the previous podcast,
01:06:12.22 --> 01:06:15.82 and if you're going to be an Emily Qualified Human, the way you're going to deal with this,
01:06:15.82 --> 01:06:20.86 when they're talking about viewing feedback objectively and unemotionally, the real scenario
01:06:20.86 --> 01:06:25.26 is, I'm in charge of this mission. I built the plan, this is all the stuff that I'm, I'm the leader
01:06:25.26 --> 01:06:31.74 that I come back and then Jacob and my instructor comes back and destroys what, give me feedback.
01:06:31.74 --> 01:06:35.18 Now, what he should be able to do is tell me all these things and make go dude, those are all
01:06:35.18 --> 01:06:38.30 really good points. I'm going to incorporate all those in the next mission brief. I'm going to build
01:06:38.30 --> 01:06:43.26 this into my plan next time. We're going to go get better. But what I do is I come show up ready for that
01:06:43.26 --> 01:06:48.06 feedback to defend what I did because that was my plan. I was the mission commander and I can't be
01:06:48.06 --> 01:06:53.98 unemotional and detached, but I should be. So if you're listening to this, your job is to take
01:06:53.98 --> 01:06:59.42 all the feedback you get even from the people that you cannot stand in an unemotional, an objective
01:06:59.42 --> 01:07:04.62 fashion. We got a question just last week, what do I do with the perennial complainer on my team
01:07:04.62 --> 01:07:09.50 that is constantly complaining about everything? You know what the answer is? Listen to him.
01:07:10.38 --> 01:07:13.50 Because it might actually have some feedback for you. The problem isn't the
01:07:13.50 --> 01:07:16.94 he's a perennial complainer or the problem that you don't want to hear him. But the almost exact
01:07:16.94 --> 01:07:21.50 opportunity to choose when you were providing feedback, if you go in with the assumption that
01:07:21.50 --> 01:07:27.42 that person will be just like you and unemotional and prepared, you're also going to be ineffective
01:07:27.42 --> 01:07:32.22 that you have to make the exact opposite approach, which is you're going to be dealing with nothing
01:07:32.22 --> 01:07:36.62 but their ego. And you know if it turns out that I'm debriefing Jaco and he's totally in the game
01:07:37.98 --> 01:07:44.22 than that's then we're good. And we represent, I don't know, 5% or 10% of the interactions
01:07:44.22 --> 01:07:50.62 if you're lucky that you're going to get. But over time, if you actually take people see you as
01:07:50.62 --> 01:07:55.02 a leader, taking other people's feedback when they appear to be not credible and not good
01:07:55.02 --> 01:07:59.26 people take feedback from and you're willing to listen to them, you actually can influence other
01:07:59.26 --> 01:08:04.94 people doing that. Takes time. What they don't talk about and here is when you decide to go do that,
01:08:04.94 --> 01:08:08.78 here's all the barriers are going to be in place with this plan of hey man, I'm just going to come
01:08:08.78 --> 01:08:11.82 to the front door of Jaco and give you some candid feedback. You're just going to take it and it's
01:08:11.82 --> 01:08:18.54 going to go again. Look, look, Marine Corps, we get the ideal. I would love, I would love if that
01:08:18.54 --> 01:08:23.50 was the way the world works. Unfortunately, we have to deal with human nature. That's what we have to
01:08:23.50 --> 01:08:27.26 deal with. Just like after the other thing combat, you have to deal deal with it in a debrief.
01:08:28.06 --> 01:08:33.90 So be ready for it. Control what you can control. Learn from it.
01:08:35.98 --> 01:08:41.18 Alright, violence and danger will always be parts of war, learning to fight in dangerous conditions
01:08:41.18 --> 01:08:45.82 despite fear and uncertainty is key to war fighting. Marines of all ranks must understand how
01:08:45.82 --> 01:08:51.02 the body and mind respond to fear and stress so that they better control the responses in any
01:08:51.02 --> 01:08:56.78 situation, including combat. Marines learn how to effectively control stress reactions and fight
01:08:56.78 --> 01:09:01.74 dangerous conditions through realistic training, increasing self awareness, understanding the attributes
01:09:01.74 --> 01:09:07.90 of war, and increasing mental and physical resilience. For example, Marines learn breathing techniques
01:09:07.90 --> 01:09:11.82 during marksmanship training to better control how the body's nervous system response
01:09:11.82 --> 01:09:16.70 to stress in order to shoot more accurately. The breathing techniques help Marines
01:09:16.70 --> 01:09:21.66 to control their heart rate, respiration, attention and muscular stress and muscles under stress,
01:09:21.66 --> 01:09:26.62 which then increases the accuracy of fire. Combat can challenge,
01:09:26.62 --> 01:09:30.62 unique cohesion and present Marines with a variety of moral and ethical dilemmas.
01:09:30.62 --> 01:09:35.82 Marines develop strong mental, moral, spiritual and ethical understanding because they are as
01:09:35.82 --> 01:09:40.22 important as physical skills when operating in the violence of combat.
01:09:40.22 --> 01:09:48.06 And it's interesting too, I thought they were going to make this connection and maybe I forgot
01:09:48.06 --> 01:09:52.22 maybe they make it later, but I don't think they do. But you and I made it on the last podcast
01:09:52.22 --> 01:09:58.38 talking about the code book. The breathing techniques help Marines control their heart rate
01:09:58.38 --> 01:10:01.90 respiration, attention, muscles under stress and then increase their accuracy of their fire.
01:10:03.34 --> 01:10:08.30 That's cool. It doesn't only apply to shooting your rifle. It applies to everything that you're
01:10:08.30 --> 01:10:12.46 going to do, whether you're dealing with somebody that's combative and you got to put hands on them,
01:10:12.46 --> 01:10:15.74 whether you're dealing with your boss at yelling with at you or whether you're dealing with
01:10:15.74 --> 01:10:21.10 your six-year-old kid that just threw a temper tantrum. All those things can come into play.
01:10:24.38 --> 01:10:29.98 The science of learning encompasses many disciplines such as neuroscience, psychology,
01:10:29.98 --> 01:10:37.18 and androgology, which is adult learning. The human brain is a constantly reorganizing system
01:10:37.18 --> 01:10:43.10 capable of being shaped and reshaped across an entire lifespan. Each new learning event impacts
01:10:43.10 --> 01:10:48.54 the brain regardless of the Marines age, rank, or level of experience. Therefore, Marines should
01:10:48.54 --> 01:10:54.06 understand that challenging experiences enhance the brain and better hone their warfighting
01:10:54.06 --> 01:10:59.82 capability. Science is also identified that individuals and teams have differences in the way they
01:10:59.82 --> 01:11:06.46 learn with varying sensory preferences for learning competencies and strengths. So that's something
01:11:06.46 --> 01:11:10.86 you hear about. You know, people learn in different ways, but the science before that one
01:11:12.78 --> 01:11:19.82 challenging experiences enhance the brain and better hone their warfighting capability. We want
01:11:19.82 --> 01:11:27.74 to do things that are hard. We need to do things that are hard. Adult learning involves adapting
01:11:27.74 --> 01:11:33.26 or modifying the prior relevant information to specific situation or problem that the Marines seek
01:11:33.26 --> 01:11:41.10 to resolve. You're taking what you know and applying it to new situations. And effective way
01:11:41.10 --> 01:11:45.98 that Marines can accelerate their learning is by indirectly learning from others through
01:11:45.98 --> 01:11:51.34 vicarious experience. By garyous experiences, our relevant learning opportunities that each
01:11:51.34 --> 01:11:55.90 marine obtains by observing, reading and studying what others have experienced. There is no
01:11:55.90 --> 01:12:05.18 excuse for not learning from others. Each Marine must learn how to learn both independently and
01:12:05.18 --> 01:12:11.90 collectively in teams. Social and interpersonal factors such as effective communication group
01:12:11.90 --> 01:12:18.78 cohesion and trust all influence learning. I'm going to read that one again. Social and interpersonal
01:12:18.78 --> 01:12:23.42 factors such as effective communication group cohesion and trust all influence learning. When these
01:12:23.42 --> 01:12:28.30 factors are positive, they facilitate learning process, facilitate the learning process and create
01:12:28.30 --> 01:12:31.90 strong relationships. This is the thing that I've gone over a bunch of times recently. It was like,
01:12:31.90 --> 01:12:40.30 hey, why was I able to like rip apart a young lieutenant in a debrief? It's because he trusted
01:12:40.30 --> 01:12:47.90 me and we had we had that the strong relationship and therefore I can say I can get candid.
01:12:49.74 --> 01:12:52.70 That's why I caught myself in the last example. I was given this example where you're going to
01:12:52.70 --> 01:12:56.06 come in and rip apart my debrief and I caught myself. I'm like, oh, I'm actually going on the
01:12:56.06 --> 01:13:00.70 assumption when I say that that we have such a good relationship that I realize that what you're
01:13:00.70 --> 01:13:04.94 doing is actually trying to help me as opposed to coming in there and being a tyrant to tear my
01:13:04.94 --> 01:13:10.94 plan apart was because of exactly that when the when the environment is positive, you can come in
01:13:10.94 --> 01:13:17.66 and you can rip that thing to shreds as you need to to shreds and all of it is for me to get better.
01:13:18.14 --> 01:13:21.90 I look at every single thing and it said to go, man, I really wish you could kind of be nicer when
01:13:21.90 --> 01:13:26.38 you say that. I mean, think about that. I just look for the things that you're saying which actually
01:13:26.38 --> 01:13:30.62 is a massive time saver and allows you to be more effective and more efficient because you're not
01:13:30.62 --> 01:13:34.86 worried about those other things but like you said before the problem with that is you can't take
01:13:34.86 --> 01:13:39.50 that for granted that that's actually really really hard to get and a lot of those people are like,
01:13:39.50 --> 01:13:45.66 hey, I'm just trying to help you out, man. I'm just trying to help you here. But if they don't hear you,
01:13:46.46 --> 01:13:50.94 it doesn't matter. You're not effective. Yeah. And the efficiency thing again, I've been talking
01:13:50.94 --> 01:13:54.86 about this lately. It's like the efficiency thing of like, well, look, wouldn't it just be easier?
01:13:54.86 --> 01:13:58.78 If I could just tell Dave, hey, Dave, here's where you screwed up and that brief and you did these
01:13:58.78 --> 01:14:03.26 three things wrong. That's obvious. Yeah. Yeah. More efficient. And I'm a matter of fact kind of guy
01:14:03.26 --> 01:14:09.10 and people's just kind of get on board and like, it would be more efficient if Dave listened to
01:14:09.10 --> 01:14:12.86 anything I said. If he made any adjustment, but the problem is he doesn't adjust anything. He just
01:14:12.86 --> 01:14:19.02 puts up his defenses and so it's efficient in delivery. It's completely inefficient in
01:14:19.02 --> 01:14:21.58 absorption. Totally. Doesn't work. It's not effective. Period.
01:14:23.58 --> 01:14:27.66 Marine should actively seek to understand human and environmental factors that influence learning
01:14:27.66 --> 01:14:31.66 while avoiding thoughts and behaviors that can negatively affect learning and cohesion.
01:14:34.86 --> 01:14:40.54 Next section, problem solving is a warfighting capability. Time spent learning how to effectively
01:14:40.54 --> 01:14:45.66 think and solve problems as time well invested. Marines must build the skills to recognize potential
01:14:45.66 --> 01:14:52.06 problems, reason and critically and think critically. Reasoning is the process of thinking about
01:14:52.06 --> 01:14:57.10 something in a logical way to form a conclusion or judgment. Critical thinking is the reflective
01:14:57.10 --> 01:15:04.06 part of that reasoning. Critical thinking skills include inference, evaluation, interpretation and
01:15:04.06 --> 01:15:10.06 explanation. Developing these skills enables Marines to understand not only the information presented,
01:15:10.06 --> 01:15:15.18 but also its potential implications and secondary effects. And this is one of those things where
01:15:16.54 --> 01:15:20.62 when you are, when you're in a leadership position, being able to do this quickly,
01:15:20.62 --> 01:15:24.54 being able to look at like a problem in a solution and two or three solutions and being able to figure
01:15:24.54 --> 01:15:28.86 out what's going to happen if I imply this one, this one, and see, hey, this one will solve it quick,
01:15:28.86 --> 01:15:32.38 but I got that I'm going to deal with this giant mess that I just created. Cool. I'm going to
01:15:32.38 --> 01:15:38.94 option B. That's the difference between the white belt, the blue belt, leader. The blue belt
01:15:38.94 --> 01:15:43.58 leader is like, okay, I see the immediate solution that I could do, but I see that after effects are
01:15:43.58 --> 01:15:50.22 worse, so I'm going to plan B. Yeah. Through reasoning and critical thinking, Marines explore
01:15:50.22 --> 01:15:55.10 question and understand the key factors affecting the situation which then enables Marines to
01:15:55.10 --> 01:16:00.86 develop better courses of action. And again, the more experience you have doing this,
01:16:00.86 --> 01:16:05.82 the quicker you'll be able to recognize the patterns of these things and you're sitting at
01:16:05.82 --> 01:16:10.94 think is, you know, from a leadership perspective, you know, you and I and rest of the guys in
01:16:10.94 --> 01:16:17.82 Estolome front working with companies, it's a classic example of, well, hey, we've got this problem here's
01:16:17.82 --> 01:16:25.50 how I'm going to solve it. And we all look at that problem ago. Okay, I see what you're saying. And I see
01:16:25.50 --> 01:16:29.90 that that seems like the direct, most direct efficient way to solve this problem. Here's the nine
01:16:29.90 --> 01:16:34.70 after effects that are going to make this just a complete gut check. Yeah, because you're not thinking
01:16:34.70 --> 01:16:40.06 through, you know, you, well, as a white belt leader, you're not seeing this or as an emotional leader or
01:16:40.06 --> 01:16:48.46 whatever. It's skipping ahead a little bit, quickly recognizing and addressing potential problems
01:16:48.46 --> 01:16:53.18 enables Marines to better deal with disruption and respond to changes in the enemy situation.
01:16:54.38 --> 01:17:04.30 Again, pattern recognition, responding to those problems, the future battle space will contain
01:17:04.30 --> 01:17:09.02 increasingly difficult problems that do not necessarily have a right answer.
01:17:11.66 --> 01:17:17.10 Therefore, Marines skills to observe objectively, reasonably, reasonably, and take decisive
01:17:17.10 --> 01:17:21.50 action and then adjust as needed remain key elements of success.
01:17:24.70 --> 01:17:29.26 I mean, that's that's right out of what you talk about the inter-v decision making. And it's,
01:17:29.26 --> 01:17:34.30 it's not just action. It's still decisive action, default to aggressive action, but just far enough
01:17:34.30 --> 01:17:38.14 for you to figure out and get the feedback of, do I need to keep going, do I need maneuver, do I need
01:17:38.14 --> 01:17:44.06 to back up? And the connection of those two, which is decisive action, and then adjust as needed.
01:17:44.86 --> 01:17:49.34 That, that is the connection that is so hard that people don't, don't make some times.
01:17:50.62 --> 01:17:54.70 Get that feedback loop going. Get that feedback. I like the, I'm not right answer. I remember
01:17:54.70 --> 01:18:02.78 hearing about the German war problems, war game problems that the only solution that would work
01:18:02.78 --> 01:18:08.78 or the only options that would work were not, you know, you were told not to do. So, hey,
01:18:08.78 --> 01:18:12.22 don't go past this limit of advance. The only way you're going to get out, this is go past
01:18:12.22 --> 01:18:19.34 that limit of advance. So, they're trying to get the Germans who have a propensity to follow rules.
01:18:20.54 --> 01:18:24.14 And so, they're trying to get them, hey, here's the rule. We, in order to get this done,
01:18:24.14 --> 01:18:27.58 you're going to need to break this rule. What are you going to do? But they don't tell them that. They
01:18:27.58 --> 01:18:32.62 just watch them and they just see them said the limit of advance and get killed in the scenario.
01:18:38.22 --> 01:18:45.42 The mind as a weapon. The philosophy of maneuver warfare guides much of what Marines do.
01:18:45.98 --> 01:18:52.22 And that right there is like, let's just have a podcast about that. In fact, I guess we do have
01:18:52.22 --> 01:18:57.66 a podcast about that, this podcast. So, the philosophy of maneuver warfare guides much of what Marines do.
01:18:57.66 --> 01:19:02.78 It is their way of thinking about and preparing for war with the intended purpose of taking
01:19:02.78 --> 01:19:09.10 decisive action against the enemy at the least cost themselves. By the way, this is maneuver warfare
01:19:09.10 --> 01:19:16.62 is the reason I kind of, as a younger leader in the teams, the reason I started to grasp onto it and
01:19:16.62 --> 01:19:21.26 understand it was because of judici. Because what's judici is, it's maneuver warfare. That's all it is.
01:19:21.26 --> 01:19:25.82 It's maneuver warfare. It's decisive action against the enemy with the least cost to yourself. That's
01:19:25.82 --> 01:19:31.42 what you're just who is. Marine study and apply maneuver warfare in order to better exploit
01:19:31.42 --> 01:19:36.06 advantages and multiple domains and create rapidly unfolding situations in the battle that
01:19:36.06 --> 01:19:41.90 overwhelm the enemy. maneuver warfare requires that Marines develop that to, oh, by the way,
01:19:41.90 --> 01:19:48.22 also that what I just read judici is to, right, create rapidly unfolding end situations that overwhelm the
01:19:48.22 --> 01:19:51.58 enemy like, oh, I'm across, oh, I'm moving here. I, I, I, I, I did your call.
01:19:54.46 --> 01:19:59.82 Minuver warfare requires that Marines develop the temperant to preserve, persevere amidst uncertainty
01:19:59.82 --> 01:20:04.38 and the mental agility to succeed in fluid and chaotic situations. Additionally, it requires
01:20:04.38 --> 01:20:11.10 being able to understand the dynamic and complex situation from multiple perspectives to determine
01:20:11.10 --> 01:20:19.26 how to exploit an advantage. Decentralized execution within the commanders intent is central
01:20:19.26 --> 01:20:25.66 to maneuver warfare. This requires that each Marine understand the situation and execute actions
01:20:25.66 --> 01:20:39.34 to support and achieve that intent. So, Decentralized command. That's why, regardless of technology
01:20:39.34 --> 01:20:43.90 and equipment, Marines are ready to fight and win. Therefore, it is essential that Marines
01:20:43.90 --> 01:20:48.06 develop and maintain an intellectual edge over any enemy by developing their minds.
01:20:49.58 --> 01:20:55.98 Just as they would prepare any other weapon system for battle. This intellectual edge must come from
01:20:57.18 --> 01:21:01.18 self-discipline study and deliberate practice as Marines
01:21:01.18 --> 01:21:08.94 to build competencies in the profession of arms as individuals, teams, units and magtafs.
01:21:11.82 --> 01:21:18.54 Once again, they're, they're, they're talking about self-discipline, they're kind of highlighting
01:21:19.82 --> 01:21:28.14 that that's what we're talking about. The last part, I think it's the last part of this section.
01:21:28.14 --> 01:21:34.14 Continuous learners developing the mind as a weapon is a career-long process.
01:21:34.14 --> 01:21:39.26 Marines are continuous learners. They pursue mastery in the profession of arms
01:21:39.26 --> 01:21:43.34 recognizing that the achievement of mastery is a journey not a destination.
01:21:44.38 --> 01:21:48.62 As adult learners, Marines recognize that they are responsible for their own learning,
01:21:48.62 --> 01:21:55.58 outcomes, actions, and decisions. As adult learners, Marines need to know why content is relevant
01:21:55.58 --> 01:22:00.70 during both training and educational activities. Marines perceive learning as a progression of
01:22:00.70 --> 01:22:09.10 goals to build competencies not a single discrete goal. Hence the analogy of the armbar in one room,
01:22:09.66 --> 01:22:14.94 the triangle and the other room. No, it's all together. It's not a single goal. It's all together.
01:22:14.94 --> 01:22:19.58 Therefore, Marines benefit most from information and learning activities presented in the context
01:22:19.58 --> 01:22:29.74 of real-life situations or task-specific problems. To become better warfighters, Marines continuously
01:22:29.74 --> 01:22:34.86 gather information and engage in activities that test their assumptions, develop new knowledge,
01:22:34.86 --> 01:22:39.50 increase critical thinking and reasoning, and build deeper understanding. Instead of simply asking
01:22:39.50 --> 01:22:47.10 what happened in a battle, Marines should always ask and seek to better understand why the events
01:22:47.10 --> 01:22:53.74 happened and consequently what to apply for for future situations. Marines must learn about a broad
01:22:53.74 --> 01:22:58.54 range of topics and skills through professional reading, experience, experience, learning, and deliberate
01:22:58.54 --> 01:23:04.54 practice. Marines must also approach each event and interaction as a learning opportunity. There is no,
01:23:04.54 --> 01:23:09.50 there is always something to learn even if that's something is what not to do in the future.
01:23:09.50 --> 01:23:14.06 As continuous learners, Marines actively seek apply and share lessons learned to develop
01:23:14.06 --> 01:23:23.98 themselves and other Marines in the profession of arms. It's interesting that in the
01:23:25.02 --> 01:23:31.90 in the EQH book, in the evaluation in the code, we've got this whole section on improving your
01:23:31.90 --> 01:23:37.26 mental capability and how that's so important. That's the same thing that the Marines are saying here,
01:23:37.26 --> 01:23:44.30 conclusion to this first section, they say, Marines adapt to every tool that they have weapons,
01:23:44.30 --> 01:23:49.58 equipment, and their minds to succeed in winning every climb in place. Marines must develop and
01:23:49.58 --> 01:23:55.50 demonstrate brilliance in the basic fundamental skills combined with the mental agility to adapt to
01:23:55.50 --> 01:24:01.34 whatever situation they face. Say that again, Marines must develop and demonstrate brilliance
01:24:01.34 --> 01:24:09.10 in the basic fundamental skills combined with the mental agility to adapt to whatever
01:24:09.10 --> 01:24:20.78 situation they face. So different from that stereotypical vision of a Marine that you are just going to
01:24:21.50 --> 01:24:28.54 obey orders, do as you're told. Follow orders or people die. Oh there you go, a few good men.
01:24:28.54 --> 01:24:36.94 Speaking of quotes. All right, so that wraps up the first chapter. Right now, I'm
01:24:38.94 --> 01:24:42.22 assessing that we're only going to make it through two chapters of this thing. So we'll do one more
01:24:42.22 --> 01:24:49.18 chapter right now and then we'll save the next one for the next podcast. Chapter two, the culture
01:24:49.18 --> 01:24:55.18 of learning starts off with the quote, humility and gender is learning because it beats back the
01:24:55.18 --> 01:25:03.90 arrogance that puts blinders on. It leaves you open for truth to reveal themselves. You don't
01:25:03.90 --> 01:25:11.66 stand in your own way. Do you know how you can tell when someone is truly humble? I believe there's
01:25:11.66 --> 01:25:21.50 one simple test because they consistently observe and listen the humble improve. Because they
01:25:21.50 --> 01:25:28.14 consistently observe and listen the humble improve. They don't assume I know the way.
01:25:28.14 --> 01:25:42.62 And who's that a quote from? Winton Morsealis. Jazz musician, trumpet player. Interesting, right?
01:25:43.82 --> 01:25:48.46 It's history that the United States Marine courts are a trumpet jazz playing musician,
01:25:48.46 --> 01:26:04.30 but his quote on humility is, it's interesting. If we hadn't written extreme ownership with a
01:26:04.30 --> 01:26:08.78 chapter called Czechy Rigo and stay humble, it's like, I'd be thinking about doing that right now.
01:26:10.46 --> 01:26:14.86 There are no secrets to success. There's a result of preparation, hard work and learning from
01:26:14.86 --> 01:26:21.26 failure. That's Colin Powell. And thanks to my reading, I have never been caught flat-footed by any
01:26:21.26 --> 01:26:27.10 situation, never at a loss for how any problem has been addressed successfully or unsuccessfully before.
01:26:28.54 --> 01:26:34.46 It doesn't give me all the answers, but it lights what is often a dark path ahead, and that is
01:26:34.46 --> 01:26:42.54 general matters. So ideas and methods can have more significant impact on warfighting than weapon
01:26:42.54 --> 01:26:50.06 systems, technology or organizational structures. This speaking of music, right?
01:26:52.06 --> 01:26:59.02 The guitar, the guitar technology that you have, the music school that you went through,
01:26:59.02 --> 01:27:07.02 none of that can compare to like good ideas. This is an underrated, an underrated
01:27:07.02 --> 01:27:16.22 grid, thought that I have. I always talk about this. I say listen, you can go to a guitar center
01:27:16.22 --> 01:27:21.10 and you can put a sign up and you can say, hey, if you can play these songs, you can pick
01:27:21.10 --> 01:27:27.50 most technical songs you know. Most underrated analogy, you can pick the most technical songs
01:27:27.50 --> 01:27:32.22 you'd say, if you can play these songs, contact me immediately. I'll give you whatever,
01:27:32.22 --> 01:27:37.66 I'll put you on this record. And you'll get hundreds of people that will be like, I can play
01:27:37.66 --> 01:27:42.62 all those songs, no for no, I got them. But all those people can't make a hit song.
01:27:43.90 --> 01:27:46.94 Because they don't have the creative, they don't have the ideas in their head.
01:27:49.18 --> 01:27:54.30 So they're saying the same thing here, no, no matter what your guitar is, no matter what technology you have,
01:27:54.30 --> 01:27:59.82 your ideas can have more significant impact on warfighting than any of those things. So the
01:27:59.82 --> 01:28:05.50 Marine Corps, learning culture, fosters the attributes that every Marine needs to pursue, such as
01:28:05.50 --> 01:28:12.70 adaptability, creativity, critical thinking, active listening and bias for action. You know,
01:28:12.70 --> 01:28:18.30 there's some, there's some horses that get beat real hard in this book. Like they get beat.
01:28:18.30 --> 01:28:21.42 One of them is bias for action. You gotta remember, we're not covered in the whole book right now.
01:28:22.06 --> 01:28:25.58 I mean, I'm skipping chunks and bias for actions all throughout this book.
01:28:25.58 --> 01:28:31.02 What did I call that? Next-stream ownership? Default the aggressive.
01:28:33.18 --> 01:28:37.02 That's got to be your default mode. Organizational culture.
01:28:38.30 --> 01:28:44.54 The Marine Corps culture values action. Again, there's that horse getting another crack in the jaw.
01:28:45.50 --> 01:28:51.50 Responsibility, ownership, adaptability and problem solving. Therefore, the Marines learning process
01:28:51.50 --> 01:29:01.82 and culture develop and exercise these values. Oh, and I've got a little note here.
01:29:03.02 --> 01:29:09.50 And this is just like the way that the Marines roll. So listen to this sentence. Listen to these
01:29:09.50 --> 01:29:14.14 two sentences. The Marine Corps culture values action, responsibility, adaptability and problem
01:29:14.14 --> 01:29:19.98 solving. Therefore, Marines learning processes and culture develop and exercise these values.
01:29:19.98 --> 01:29:25.02 What's cool about the Marine Corps is they're not saying this is what the Marine Corps should aspire to
01:29:25.02 --> 01:29:31.66 or this is what the Marine Corps should do. They say there was the Marine Corps does. Like it's not even
01:29:31.66 --> 01:29:37.02 it's not even a question. That's what the Marine Corps does. The Marine Corps hierarchical command structure
01:29:37.02 --> 01:29:43.42 and process may at times be perceived as an obstacle to adaptability and learning. Although both
01:29:43.42 --> 01:29:50.46 are essential for the proper exercise of command and control, Marines must ensure that they do not
01:29:50.46 --> 01:29:55.90 set conditions for unintended negative effects on learning that could negatively impact
01:29:55.90 --> 01:30:03.42 war fighting such as discouraging Marines initiative feedback or problem solving. Huge, huge. What
01:30:03.42 --> 01:30:08.70 happens when the dichotomy of chain of command goes too far? Now we have people that aren't giving
01:30:08.70 --> 01:30:17.42 feedback anymore. So we need to make sure it doesn't set those conditions. Again, it's important
01:30:17.42 --> 01:30:24.54 that we think about learning. We're thinking about it from the perspective of learning what the
01:30:24.54 --> 01:30:29.66 enemy is doing and it's how I'm going to defeat the enemy. It's not like it affects not like negative
01:30:29.66 --> 01:30:36.30 effect on learning the proper technique for cleaning this weapon. We're talking about learning how to beat
01:30:36.30 --> 01:30:47.10 the enemy actively while that fight is happening. Skip and handle a little bit. Leaders at all levels
01:30:47.10 --> 01:30:52.86 are charged with creating an environment where continuous learning becomes the standard. Leaders serve
01:30:52.86 --> 01:30:58.46 as positive examples of a disciplined approach to learning while also providing their Marines with
01:30:58.46 --> 01:31:06.62 constructive feedback. Leaders of Marines must dedicate time and effort to learning and prioritize
01:31:06.62 --> 01:31:17.66 mental fitness as much as physical fitness. Dang. Dang. You know what? One of my next missions
01:31:17.66 --> 01:31:23.02 and I guess we're kind of what we might be on it. It's probably going on right now, right? But
01:31:23.02 --> 01:31:30.06 systematic learning. Again, it's kind of goes back like the idea of the thread. You should be able
01:31:30.06 --> 01:31:36.54 to just pick up and learn things in a cohesive manner. And there's, and I get that there's
01:31:36.54 --> 01:31:41.90 there's some part of learning things in a non cohesive manner that forces you to learn how to
01:31:41.90 --> 01:31:47.10 put them into a cohesive manner. So there's something to that and I get it. But you should be
01:31:47.10 --> 01:31:52.70 able to at least take different subjects and get them close enough to each other so that people can
01:31:52.70 --> 01:31:57.58 easily make those connections. And then maybe you learn how to spread those things about
01:31:57.58 --> 01:32:01.02 a part of a little further. So people have to think even more to get those connections to come.
01:32:02.46 --> 01:32:10.54 But we make it so hard to learn so many different subjects that we just don't connect. We don't
01:32:10.54 --> 01:32:20.78 bring any cohesion to. We don't act. We act as if science history, literature, poetry, art. We
01:32:20.78 --> 01:32:27.42 act as if they're these separate things. And they're not. And the better you understand each one of
01:32:27.42 --> 01:32:30.70 those things and then the better you understand how they fit together, the better you understand
01:32:30.70 --> 01:32:34.22 them all, and the better you understand them all, the better you understand human nature and people.
01:32:34.94 --> 01:32:39.34 The better you understand people, the better you can take all this, all the things that you
01:32:39.34 --> 01:32:45.26 deal with in life and put them into context and do something and shape the outcome of your life.
01:32:53.98 --> 01:33:01.02 So we need to prioritize mental fitness. And again, it's interesting. We wrote the code and
01:33:01.02 --> 01:33:07.74 evaluation in the protocols before this book came out. But we made number one, the number one thing
01:33:07.74 --> 01:33:15.02 you need to take care of as physical fitness and number two is mental fitness. And the reason we
01:33:15.02 --> 01:33:18.94 prioritize them like that is because if you don't have a body, you don't have a mind.
01:33:21.98 --> 01:33:28.06 I don't think anyone can argue with that. Continuing on, integrating learning activities
01:33:28.06 --> 01:33:31.50 into physical training events when Marines are both mentally and physically challenged,
01:33:31.50 --> 01:33:36.86 encourages deep learning and facilitates the recall of lessons learned during combat situations.
01:33:41.34 --> 01:33:47.98 Awesome. As part of the learning experience, leaders must foster an environment that
01:33:47.98 --> 01:33:55.50 appropriately tolerates mistakes, errors, and challenges to existing ideas. Challenging ideas and
01:33:55.50 --> 01:34:04.94 making mistakes are part of the learning process. Boom. Challenging ideas and making mistakes are
01:34:04.94 --> 01:34:11.74 part of the learning process. If you're not encouraging your subordinates to challenge your ideas,
01:34:11.74 --> 01:34:17.98 I mean, I love it when people challenge my ideas. It actually, I love it. I love it.
01:34:19.26 --> 01:34:24.22 And it's not because I want to, it's not because I have an opportunity to like beat them or show
01:34:24.22 --> 01:34:30.70 them that I know what's up. I like it because I know I'm going to learn something. I'll learn from
01:34:30.70 --> 01:34:35.34 their challenge. Their challenge is going to either break through my position and I'm going to
01:34:35.34 --> 01:34:40.94 realize that they're right or it's going to make me patch a hole in my position that was a
01:34:40.94 --> 01:34:51.10 vulnerability that now we can utilize this idea and it's going to be stronger. Challenging
01:34:51.10 --> 01:34:55.26 ideas in a respectful and constructive way contributes to improve learning for both subordinates and
01:34:55.26 --> 01:35:02.86 leaders. They threw that in there thankfully. Yeah. Yes. And in leadership strategy and tactics,
01:35:02.86 --> 01:35:11.50 I actually tell you how to save these words correctly because it's not easy. Yeah, like, I like to
01:35:11.50 --> 01:35:15.18 speak the truth. I'm a straight shooter. I'm going to come right at you and like, hey,
01:35:15.18 --> 01:35:21.58 let's just how I am. So I'm going to challenge you my boss in a way that totally undermines the
01:35:21.58 --> 01:35:25.02 relationship we have. And I just tell you how screwed up you are now wrong. And you're the
01:35:25.02 --> 01:35:28.78 problem because you won't listen to me. That's going to work out. That's not going to work out. That's
01:35:28.78 --> 01:35:34.14 right. Yeah. But I'm the guy that speaks the truth. You know, bosses who want to hear it. People don't
01:35:34.14 --> 01:35:39.10 like that. Yeah. Boss just doesn't want to hear it. You can't handle the truth. There we go in there.
01:35:39.10 --> 01:35:45.58 Leaders should permit ideas to be challenged in discussion and planning up to the point where
01:35:45.58 --> 01:35:51.98 the leader makes decision. Leaders should not automatically interpret a subordinate,
01:35:51.98 --> 01:35:57.18 challenging an idea or providing feedback as challenging their authority. Chitching. Yeah.
01:35:57.18 --> 01:36:00.54 So they cover it both. Nope. You need a challenge it in a respectful way. And oh, by the way,
01:36:00.54 --> 01:36:06.62 you need to listen to it as if it's not an attacking earth or a go. But I said in the leaders
01:36:06.62 --> 01:36:12.62 of strategy and tactics, people usually think their idea is the best idea. It's just, it's just
01:36:12.62 --> 01:36:17.66 kind of the way it is. Totally. And you know what? You can actually program yourself to not be that
01:36:17.66 --> 01:36:21.42 way. And I think I've done a pretty good job with that. Actually, I usually think like, okay, my
01:36:21.42 --> 01:36:26.38 idea is out there, but it's not necessarily right. And I'm, I want to hear other people's ideas.
01:36:28.22 --> 01:36:33.26 You can totally train to that. You can totally teach yourself to do that. And the thing that makes
01:36:33.26 --> 01:36:37.34 that easier over time is you actually start to win more. Oh, yeah. Life gets better. Like,
01:36:37.34 --> 01:36:41.26 oh, this was a really big, a big stretch from my ego to start to tolerate that. I'm like, oh,
01:36:41.26 --> 01:36:45.50 oh, my life is 100 times better now than it was. This isn't that hard. Hey, you got feedback from me?
01:36:45.50 --> 01:36:49.18 Dude, bring it on. Yeah. Because I bet you my life gets better if I listen to your feedback.
01:36:51.66 --> 01:36:56.14 The leaders authority gives him or her the responsibility to make decisions, but does not mean that
01:36:56.14 --> 01:37:00.14 the leaders have to develop all the ideas themselves. Leaders should try to do the
01:37:00.14 --> 01:37:07.90 intoxics. We're. By the way, yeah, whoever authored this thing, the legit, nicely done,
01:37:07.90 --> 01:37:10.70 I appreciate the appreciated.
01:37:12.78 --> 01:37:18.06 Subordinates need to be willing to admit mistakes, ask questions and seek corrective feedback.
01:37:18.70 --> 01:37:23.34 Naturally, a subordinate, a subordinates willingness to admit mistakes depends on the
01:37:23.34 --> 01:37:30.86 commanders willingness to tolerate them. And what's good about that, well, I would, you know, a
01:37:30.86 --> 01:37:35.98 little adjustment there are subordinates willingness to admit mistakes, but also a subordinates willingness
01:37:35.98 --> 01:37:40.30 to make mistakes or take risks that will result in mistakes depends on the commanders
01:37:40.30 --> 01:37:43.90 are willing to tolerate. So if you got a person that never tolerates any mistakes, guess what?
01:37:44.62 --> 01:37:45.66 No one's going to do anything for them.
01:37:45.66 --> 01:37:53.02 That's like one of the major criticisms of like the traditional educational process.
01:37:54.22 --> 01:37:58.94 That the low tolerance from mistakes. So like you take a quiz, it's probably different now.
01:37:58.94 --> 01:38:02.78 I don't know. I've been a long time since I've been high school, but you know when you take a test
01:38:02.78 --> 01:38:09.18 or a quiz, right? Say you have 10 questions, right? You get five of them wrong. That's a F.
01:38:09.18 --> 01:38:15.26 Straight up F. 50. Oh yeah. So let's say you have four quizzes through the course of the year.
01:38:17.18 --> 01:38:21.74 If you've got to F that, it factors into your final grade. No matter if you got those questions right
01:38:21.74 --> 01:38:26.54 later or not, you could learn 100% of the material perfectly, but if you've got to F on one of
01:38:26.54 --> 01:38:32.54 those quizzes, your grade might not be 100%. So if you make a mistake, even if you correct the
01:38:32.54 --> 01:38:37.90 mistake, you still do punish for it. Seems saying you could know the correct answer to the
01:38:37.90 --> 01:38:42.94 mistake that you made thoroughly through and through, you still get punished. I see your point.
01:38:43.82 --> 01:38:49.66 However, I think there's other things that are being trained, right? Like you need to prepare and
01:38:49.66 --> 01:38:55.42 study and be ready, right? Yeah. And life doesn't always give you a second third fourth chance
01:38:55.42 --> 01:39:03.10 to square yourself away from your 50. Yeah, but maybe that's what's high school is for, maybe not.
01:39:03.10 --> 01:39:10.62 But so I guess you're arguing. What I don't like about what I just said is that
01:39:11.66 --> 01:39:17.50 I'm clearly thinking of it from like a well, I actually don't, not that I don't like what I just said.
01:39:17.50 --> 01:39:20.62 Well, you could you could argue well, hey, Jocos, you just want people learning and studying
01:39:20.62 --> 01:39:26.70 for grades to get an A on a grade. And that's not that that's not what I want. But there is a fact
01:39:26.70 --> 01:39:31.42 of when you go to school, you're learning. Okay, I got to do certain things. I got to do certain
01:39:31.42 --> 01:39:35.02 things I don't want to do and I got to do them on time. Yeah. Those are important lessons to learn.
01:39:35.02 --> 01:39:39.98 Yeah, about life. Yeah. So what you're, unless you want to throw it at me that school is
01:39:39.98 --> 01:39:46.14 develops that we could break children mentally and train them to be factory workers, which is also
01:39:46.14 --> 01:39:50.94 true. That is one of the criticisms or the reason for that, you know, that whole, you know what I actually
01:39:52.14 --> 01:39:58.46 picked up on right now. It's nothing new, really. What you just did, you just responded to that.
01:39:58.46 --> 01:40:04.22 What I just said with extreme ownership, with extreme responsibility, you know, you're,
01:40:04.22 --> 01:40:09.90 I said, this is a major criticism of the school system and you essentially said in so many words,
01:40:09.90 --> 01:40:13.50 hey, don't blame the school system, you take responsibility for going to school. That's essentially
01:40:13.50 --> 01:40:19.02 what you said back to me. Interesting. That's a make what I said any last true. But you, you were like,
01:40:19.02 --> 01:40:23.58 okay, cool, you know, so what are you going to do about it kind of thing? Yeah, you better, you know,
01:40:23.58 --> 01:40:27.26 you better study hard, you better work hard, kind of thing. Seems like. Yeah, well, and that's the point
01:40:27.26 --> 01:40:31.90 that that's the point is what are we trying to do with school, right? Is it, there's a bunch of
01:40:31.90 --> 01:40:36.86 things that are going on with school. And maybe if we clarify those things more, you could understand
01:40:36.86 --> 01:40:40.46 because do you want the person to learn education, right? Do you want them to get smarter? Do you want
01:40:40.46 --> 01:40:44.14 them to get knowledge? Yes, do you want them to learn about how to live their life? Yes.
01:40:45.98 --> 01:40:52.46 And how do you balance those things correctly? I think not to go too deep into the school system
01:40:52.46 --> 01:40:57.98 or nothing like that. But I think that saying that or feeling that like, hey, it teaches you to do
01:40:57.98 --> 01:41:03.02 this and do this on top of like the math that I'm that you're learning in the class.
01:41:04.14 --> 01:41:11.42 I think that's sort of like a like a wiggly like not excuse, but it's like they'll just throw
01:41:11.42 --> 01:41:15.02 that in as like part of the school. I guess what it needs is a clear definition of the mission of
01:41:15.02 --> 01:41:19.90 the school. Yeah, clear definition of the school. And as a high school kid or whatever you go on
01:41:19.90 --> 01:41:23.90 the class in math class, what are we learning in math class? You tell me, what are we learning in math
01:41:23.90 --> 01:41:28.62 class? Math, right? I didn't know we're going to learn all these other life lessons that
01:41:28.62 --> 01:41:33.74 no one says by the way. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. So it's like okay, I did. So maybe if they clarify
01:41:33.74 --> 01:41:38.30 the mission and said, hey, this isn't isn't just about learning math. This is about learning how to
01:41:38.30 --> 01:41:42.38 operate with other people. This is learning about how to learn time management. It's one of the things
01:41:42.38 --> 01:41:46.78 you're about to learn. If you got told that, you probably be okay. I get it. That was part of the
01:41:46.78 --> 01:41:51.18 curriculum. Yeah. If you got told that because I don't know some people say that all the time,
01:41:51.18 --> 01:41:55.74 but then it's like, well, the rest of the stuff going on doesn't support what you're saying
01:41:55.74 --> 01:42:00.46 right now, but whatever. But yeah, if that was part of the curriculum, oh yeah, 100%. 100%.
01:42:01.66 --> 01:42:07.50 Check. All right. Back to the book. Marines will learn from their mistakes when they receive
01:42:07.50 --> 01:42:12.86 constructive, corrective feedback. By the way, I'll do a little additive to that statement.
01:42:12.86 --> 01:42:18.22 Marines will not learn from their mistakes if they are offended by that constructive,
01:42:18.22 --> 01:42:26.22 corrective feedback. The easiest hedge against the potential of some of your guys on your
01:42:26.22 --> 01:42:30.86 team in the Marine Corps anywhere else of having a problem with that is to actually take
01:42:30.86 --> 01:42:35.26 ownership of the mistakes they make. And I just wrote down like, hey, the ultimate form of
01:42:35.26 --> 01:42:39.02 tolerating other people's mistakes, which is really what this is about is you want to let your
01:42:39.02 --> 01:42:43.98 people make mistakes because that's actually good. It's learning. It's a way is to take response
01:42:43.98 --> 01:42:48.22 to the building for that is to when you're setting up the debrief, rather than go, hey,
01:42:49.58 --> 01:42:55.90 corporate willing. Here's 37 things you screwed up on this mission that we did as opposed to.
01:42:55.90 --> 01:43:00.54 Hey, let's talk about these things. Here's all the things that happen here. Here's all the things that
01:43:00.54 --> 01:43:04.46 I'm going to do differently next time to put you in a position to be successful. So he's actually
01:43:04.46 --> 01:43:11.34 not afraid. My boss thinks this was his mistake. So even inside this thing, this idea of,
01:43:11.34 --> 01:43:15.74 he said you tolerating your willingness to tolerate your subordinate's mistakes. Well,
01:43:15.74 --> 01:43:19.02 anybody who listens to this podcast should know that that actually shouldn't be that hard at this
01:43:19.02 --> 01:43:22.70 point because any mistake your subordinate's make is actually whose fault is that really?
01:43:22.70 --> 01:43:26.62 The machine gunners, I know we've used that example a thousand times. And if you want to
01:43:26.62 --> 01:43:31.98 breed the idea that making those mistakes is okay, there's a really easy formula to make in that
01:43:31.98 --> 01:43:36.06 happened and it'll just make them admit it more and actually come with better creative solutions to that.
01:43:36.06 --> 01:43:40.54 So they make them less over time. Yeah. And those are things, leadership strategy and tactics.
01:43:40.54 --> 01:43:45.10 I actually wrote down what to say and what not to say. Yeah. There's a person.
01:43:45.10 --> 01:43:47.98 I'm just saying this, say that. And by the way, one of the reasons that
01:43:49.10 --> 01:43:53.90 leadership strategy and tactics that I went down that road is because
01:43:55.18 --> 01:43:59.26 and I was saying this to a group the other day on EF online.
01:43:59.26 --> 01:44:10.86 And it's one of these things where it's here's the deal. I've been doing this for a long time.
01:44:11.50 --> 01:44:15.42 So when I tell someone, hey, what you need to do is take, you know, go in there and use a
01:44:15.42 --> 01:44:18.94 flanking maneuver and set them up with this and plant it an idea in your head and it'll be good.
01:44:20.06 --> 01:44:24.94 Then I have to be careful with that because I'm good at it.
01:44:24.94 --> 01:44:30.54 I'm good. I did it when I was at E5 with my particular matter. I did it when I was at
01:44:30.54 --> 01:44:33.58 the idea, I did it through the chain of things. I did it. I've done it a million times.
01:44:33.58 --> 01:44:41.74 So when some clients says, hey, how do I handle this person that is complaining, right?
01:44:41.74 --> 01:44:45.58 Or is objecting to the way we're doing things? How do I handle that?
01:44:46.30 --> 01:44:50.06 And I say, oh, you could do this. I have to say, and listen, you need to be
01:44:50.06 --> 01:44:53.90 tactful when you do it. You need to think about it from their perspective. Because sometimes
01:44:53.90 --> 01:44:57.98 people hear, oh, you need to go talk to them about it. Okay, got it. Boom, they're rolling into the
01:44:57.98 --> 01:45:06.22 office. Yeah, I need to talk to you about x, y and z. No, I didn't mean that. So that's why I like
01:45:06.22 --> 01:45:10.62 leader's strategy and tactics. Like here's how you actually say this. The machine gunner made a
01:45:10.62 --> 01:45:17.10 mistake. It's not, hey, echo, you shot outside of your field of fire. It's, hey, echo. I don't think
01:45:17.10 --> 01:45:21.90 I did a good job explaining what your field of fire was because you just got danger close to the
01:45:21.90 --> 01:45:31.42 other squad. That's my fault. You go, there you go. Boom. Next, a critical element of learning
01:45:31.42 --> 01:45:36.06 from mistakes is embracing an appropriate level of risk. Combat is inherently dangerous and
01:45:36.06 --> 01:45:43.10 risky. However, the greatest mistake in combat could be an unwillingness to act from a fear of
01:45:43.10 --> 01:45:50.38 risk or failure to adapt to the changing situation. So how do you get good at doing? How do you get
01:45:50.38 --> 01:45:54.70 good at figuring out what the appropriate level of risk is? It's by making mistakes. So if you don't
01:45:54.70 --> 01:45:59.18 make mistakes in training, when the time comes in combat and you're unwilling to even try anything,
01:45:59.18 --> 01:46:03.58 either out of fear or risk of failure or risk of getting yelled at or failure to adapt because
01:46:03.58 --> 01:46:11.18 you've never done it before. Like the time when you're a squad leader and you're like looking around
01:46:11.18 --> 01:46:16.22 and someone says, hey man, just go for it. You go for it. And you like things turn out,
01:46:16.22 --> 01:46:19.66 maybe they turn out okay, maybe they turn out bad. But either way, you go, okay, well, I kind of
01:46:19.66 --> 01:46:23.90 did it. And then you realize you know what, next time I do it, I need to do it a little bit faster,
01:46:23.90 --> 01:46:29.18 but I need to, I need to, you know, keep the squad more, more, more distance between each other.
01:46:29.18 --> 01:46:32.46 Okay, cool. You learn to do a little something. Now, next time you make an aggressive mood,
01:46:32.46 --> 01:46:36.22 you've got this little more dispersion in your squad and everyone stays alive and it's cool.
01:46:36.22 --> 01:46:42.06 Again, this is training. So that way, by the time you get in a point in combat where you need to
01:46:42.06 --> 01:46:47.66 take some initiative, you've done it before. You do not want anyone on your subordinate team
01:46:47.66 --> 01:46:52.54 to the first time they show a half to show any initiative is in a combat situation or isn't a
01:46:52.54 --> 01:46:57.26 business meeting or isn't a with a client. That's real. That's not the first time you want to see them
01:46:57.26 --> 01:47:04.06 take initiative. Have them take initiative and some control environments to kick it off.
01:47:07.02 --> 01:47:15.58 Continuing on. Therefore, Marines should only take reasonable rest during training and
01:47:15.58 --> 01:47:19.74 learn to adapt to the changing situation where the witches wanted to just say, all Marines
01:47:19.74 --> 01:47:25.82 regardless of position or rank must discuss what led to mistakes take corrective action and learn
01:47:25.82 --> 01:47:29.82 from them. You got a debrief. Learning from mistakes is key to Marines, learning to act
01:47:29.82 --> 01:47:35.50 decisively and effectively while taking prudent rescuers, everything I just said. There's a little
01:47:35.50 --> 01:47:39.50 section in here, which I've been skipping some of these sections, but I'm going to hit this one. This
01:47:39.50 --> 01:47:47.02 is a battle-bell award. Captain John W. Thomas and Juni who earned the Navy Cross during his service
01:47:47.02 --> 01:47:52.70 with first Battalion 5th Marines wrote about the fourth Marine Brigade and he says,
01:47:52.70 --> 01:47:56.78 Plotunes were formed and I'm skipping ahead of Little Bobbi says, Plotunes were formed in four
01:47:56.78 --> 01:48:02.38 waves. He goes into it talking about how they had maps and how they had a plan and how they were
01:48:02.38 --> 01:48:07.82 basically using what they had learned from the French. And so he says, Plotunes were formed in
01:48:07.82 --> 01:48:13.50 four waves, the attack formation taught by the French, a formation proved in trench warfare, where
01:48:13.50 --> 01:48:18.86 there was a short way to go and you calculated on losing the first three waves and getting the
01:48:18.86 --> 01:48:26.70 fourth one to the objective. That's what they got taught. Hey, you're going to take four waves
01:48:26.70 --> 01:48:32.30 of people, the first three, they're all going to die and the fourth one will get through. And then
01:48:32.30 --> 01:48:39.10 it says, after the first engagement, the Marines never used it again. It was a formation that's
01:48:39.10 --> 01:48:44.46 simply accepted casualties was not adapted for open warfare and left formations rushing across
01:48:44.46 --> 01:48:51.66 open ground incredibly vulnerable. It did not take the Marines long to learn better and to adapt
01:48:51.66 --> 01:49:06.14 their tactics and found it on sound basics learned during their training. There's anything else on that.
01:49:07.02 --> 01:49:11.98 I knew you were going to talk about that just because of how often you and I have talked about
01:49:11.98 --> 01:49:15.98 over one and you hit that over and over again of all the wars like that's the one you look at
01:49:15.98 --> 01:49:22.54 and I'm like, what was going on there? What was going on there from a leadership standpoint? And
01:49:22.54 --> 01:49:28.78 honestly, my favorite line is after the first engagement, the Marines never used it again.
01:49:30.06 --> 01:49:35.42 One time they looked around and like, we're not doing this anymore. And there's kind of a stunning
01:49:35.42 --> 01:49:39.66 piece on leadership of what was everybody else and they've been doing it for years when the
01:49:39.66 --> 01:49:46.62 Marines showed up. Anyway, I just knew that given how much we've talked about that comment,
01:49:46.62 --> 01:49:50.38 there was actually really important comment this they saw at once and they recognized right away.
01:49:50.38 --> 01:49:54.86 This is wrong and we need to adapt right now. You don't need to do this five, six, seven,
01:49:54.86 --> 01:50:02.94 eight, ten times to realize this is a bad, bad plan. Yeah, the, the, um, we now had Dean
01:50:02.94 --> 01:50:11.66 Ladd on, Taroa, right? And one of the things that he pointed out was when they were in,
01:50:11.66 --> 01:50:18.86 I think New Zealand. So in between, in between, Island storming in the Pacific,
01:50:19.82 --> 01:50:23.74 they were saying that, you know, one thing that they noticed about the Japanese was that the
01:50:23.74 --> 01:50:28.86 Japanese didn't adapt. They didn't change anything. They would do the same thing like not only from a,
01:50:28.86 --> 01:50:33.18 not only from a tactical perspective like, oh, we're going to rush you. And if we don't get
01:50:33.18 --> 01:50:36.62 through today, we're going to rush you tomorrow from the same position. But not like that, but then
01:50:37.18 --> 01:50:41.50 and you could see some changes in the way they defended the islands. Like sometimes they've
01:50:41.50 --> 01:50:44.62 let the Marines come ashore and then they've kind of set them up and sometimes they wouldn't let
01:50:44.62 --> 01:50:48.70 them come ashore. So they would make these small changes. But for the most part, it was like,
01:50:48.70 --> 01:50:51.98 we knew what the Japanese were going to do and they weren't going to change how they were doing
01:50:51.98 --> 01:50:55.98 things. And you know, I was talking to Lave about it. Lave's like, yeah,
01:50:55.98 --> 01:51:00.46 now it's kind of hard to pass on lessons learned when everyone is dead.
01:51:01.18 --> 01:51:04.86 Which is what was going on with the Japanese, right? Oh, you wanted to defend this island? Cool.
01:51:04.86 --> 01:51:08.78 Well, you know, lessons are getting to the next island, none of them, because you're all dead.
01:51:09.82 --> 01:51:15.18 You know, we, the only people that survive are 14 Korean slaves that two survives,
01:51:15.18 --> 01:51:22.94 everyone else dies. Yeah. But the fact that in this situation, yeah, and that is absolutely,
01:51:22.94 --> 01:51:29.98 you know, World War I just sickens me totally. And you know, all war is awful, but that war and
01:51:29.98 --> 01:51:37.58 the leadership in that war, to just Roger that. Yep, Roger that. Roger that. Roger that. Roger that.
01:51:40.86 --> 01:51:47.74 All right. Section here, areas of responsibility. There are four functional areas of
01:51:47.74 --> 01:51:51.18 responsibility in the culture of learning as shown in the following figure. And there's the
01:51:51.18 --> 01:51:56.62 other little figure here and it's got some circles that the smallest circle is marine,
01:51:57.66 --> 01:52:04.30 meaning the individual marine. And then the instructor and then the commander or leader
01:52:05.18 --> 01:52:09.90 and then the marine core as an entire institution. So it goes like this. First is it is each
01:52:09.90 --> 01:52:17.58 individual's marine's responsibility to progress in his or her own self education and build a
01:52:17.58 --> 01:52:23.02 bias for intelligent action. There's that's incumbent upon every single marine is to learn
01:52:23.02 --> 01:52:30.94 everything that you can and build a bias for intelligent action. There, there's another
01:52:32.94 --> 01:52:41.90 whip on that horse. I think they're making it perfectly clear to every marine that what we want
01:52:41.90 --> 01:52:48.78 you to do is take action to and some smart go. It must be interesting to tell these young
01:52:48.78 --> 01:52:53.50 fire team leaders or these two commanders like get them together and I'd be like a two commander.
01:52:54.30 --> 01:52:59.18 Imagine if every one of your, you have eight fire teams. Imagine if each one of your fire teams
01:52:59.18 --> 01:53:03.90 was doing something smart in support of what you were trying to make happen. How hard would your
01:53:03.90 --> 01:53:07.50 job be? And you'd be like not hard. And I'd be like, yeah, check. I'd be like fire team leaders.
01:53:07.50 --> 01:53:12.54 You hear that? This guy wants you to do stuff. He wants you to make something happen.
01:53:12.94 --> 01:53:17.98 Make something happen. Do us all a favor and make something happen. I'm tired of watching you
01:53:17.98 --> 01:53:22.70 guys sit around trying to form a perimeter being directed by the task you to commander himself
01:53:22.70 --> 01:53:26.86 on how to form the perimeter for the love of God. Would you take up a security position?
01:53:31.10 --> 01:53:36.14 Second, within formal schools instructors should be selected based upon their potential to become
01:53:36.14 --> 01:53:40.38 effective teachers facilitators and mentors and it goes into some of that third leaders at
01:53:40.38 --> 01:53:45.50 all levels are responsible for setting the conditions within the unit for the subordinates professional
01:53:45.50 --> 01:53:52.54 military learning and development. In the teams those two are probably opposite like, I don't know
01:53:52.54 --> 01:54:00.22 what's opposite, but there's no doubt that in the seal teams the leader of a platoon, like the leader
01:54:00.22 --> 01:54:04.54 and the platoon commander and the platoon chief or the task unit commander and the task unit senior
01:54:04.54 --> 01:54:09.82 in the list of the adviser, they are way more responsible than some instructor that you had anywhere
01:54:09.82 --> 01:54:14.70 along the way. I don't know if it's I don't know if you could make that statement about the Marine Corps.
01:54:18.14 --> 01:54:22.70 I think there's that hierarchical component that I think just sits inside it and I think a lot of ways
01:54:22.70 --> 01:54:26.30 it's sort of this connection of that's something that's very easily digestible for the lowest level
01:54:26.30 --> 01:54:29.82 of a range of recognized where they fit in the big picture, but the bigger thing that's happening
01:54:29.82 --> 01:54:35.58 there is that that sort of comes full circle when the Marine Corps as an institution has this obligation
01:54:35.58 --> 01:54:41.26 facility that that goes back and affects the individual marine and that your individual role actually
01:54:41.26 --> 01:54:46.06 plays, we talk about this all the time, you can plan outside influence on the entire organization
01:54:46.06 --> 01:54:50.78 if you were doing something that's making you better, which is making your team better and then each
01:54:50.78 --> 01:54:55.34 role in leadership has an obligation to facilitate that and then it comes right back to the individual.
01:54:55.34 --> 01:55:00.94 Whenever I talk about training with a company, I was maybe you can help me with my own quote,
01:55:00.94 --> 01:55:06.30 but it's something along the lines of training is the solemn duty of the leaders inside of it.
01:55:06.30 --> 01:55:10.38 You know, it's not the responsibility of the trainers, it's not the responsibility of the instructors,
01:55:10.38 --> 01:55:14.06 it's not the responsibility of the schoolhouse. If you work for me, I'm responsible for making
01:55:14.06 --> 01:55:17.42 sure you're trained and I can use those assets however I see fit, but I'm responsible for it.
01:55:17.42 --> 01:55:26.54 Yeah. And then finally the Marine Corps as an institution demonstrates a focus and commitment
01:55:26.54 --> 01:55:32.14 to encouraging career long learning by continuously refining, learning methods and providing resources
01:55:32.14 --> 01:55:37.66 and opportunities for professional development. That's the way the Marine Corps rolls.
01:55:40.14 --> 01:55:45.34 Professional expectations next section, Marines are expected to have
01:55:45.34 --> 01:55:50.86 initiative self-discipline and motivation to actively engage in learning opportunities on their own.
01:55:53.50 --> 01:55:56.22 Wouldn't that be nice if that was a universal truth about humans?
01:55:57.98 --> 01:56:02.30 Right? If we just said humans are expected to have initiative self-discipline and motivation
01:56:02.30 --> 01:56:05.18 to actively engage in learning opportunities on their own.
01:56:05.18 --> 01:56:14.70 Marine's must take ownership of personal learning by creating specific professional goals.
01:56:16.38 --> 01:56:19.18 Again, the evaluation that we wrote.
01:56:21.26 --> 01:56:24.86 After assessing progress, Marines may adjust their goals so that they may,
01:56:24.86 --> 01:56:29.18 this is that they remain challenging. Conversely, if a Marine struggles to attain a goal by the
01:56:29.18 --> 01:56:35.26 data established, the goal may need to be adjusted to include additional in-term steps, feedback, or modified
01:56:35.26 --> 01:56:42.78 timeline. Establish and clear, short, mid and long-term goals enables the Marines
01:56:43.90 --> 01:56:49.66 to plan a clear path forward toward professional development. And again, this is sort of the reason
01:56:49.66 --> 01:56:55.10 why we put together the code and the evaluation and the protocols for everything that just got
01:56:55.10 --> 01:56:59.18 just written right there. Yeah, that paragraph to me was what's huge. I highlighted the whole thing.
01:56:59.18 --> 01:57:04.30 I wrote the word dude and underlined it. Dude, this is ridiculous. And then I wrote down,
01:57:04.30 --> 01:57:08.46 this is why we did that ranking scale and I'm not qualified human being. If you're doing this
01:57:08.46 --> 01:57:12.54 thing and it's easy, guess what? You need to ramp it up because there's no longer your baseline.
01:57:12.54 --> 01:57:16.86 This is too easy for you, so you need to make that more challenging. And if not, you get to go back.
01:57:16.86 --> 01:57:28.22 But you need initiative, self-discipline, motivation and ownership. These are all, these are all,
01:57:28.22 --> 01:57:32.30 these are all my concurrence with all these. I'm telling you, other way. I know, I don't know these
01:57:32.30 --> 01:57:38.14 guys, but I know who these guys are, I know who these guys are.
01:57:38.14 --> 01:57:45.42 Uh, skip ahead a little bit. Learning is also a process of professional growth.
01:57:45.42 --> 01:57:49.82 Marines demonstrate motivation of professionalism by cultivating a growth mindset.
01:57:49.82 --> 01:57:54.30 Individuals with a growth mindset believe that effort and learning can change
01:57:54.30 --> 01:57:58.22 ones qualities, leading to development and success.
01:58:01.02 --> 01:58:06.30 Marines with a growth mindset understand that they have control over their individual learning.
01:58:06.30 --> 01:58:09.74 And that the additional effort pays off developing,
01:58:09.74 --> 01:58:15.58 in developing the knowledge and skills to improve. Conversely, individuals with the fixed
01:58:15.58 --> 01:58:21.90 mindset believe that their qualities are innate. And our interest in feedback only to confirm
01:58:21.90 --> 01:58:27.34 their abilities of avoiding feedback that indicates any perceived weaknesses.
01:58:27.34 --> 01:58:34.22 Avoiding feedback and having a fixed mindset leads to stagnation.
01:58:43.66 --> 01:58:48.22 And they wrap this chapter up. I mean, we could talk about intrinsic motivation is driven
01:58:48.22 --> 01:58:53.82 by perceived internal rewards. That is, one is driven to engage in a behavior because it is satisfying.
01:58:53.82 --> 01:58:57.66 Leaders can cultivate this type of motivation within Marines by supporting the growth mindset
01:58:57.66 --> 01:59:01.98 and individual Marines can sustain it throughout their careers. In this way, the Marine Corps
01:59:01.98 --> 01:59:07.26 culture of learning encourages commanders, leaders and structures teams and individuals to all
01:59:07.26 --> 01:59:10.46 support intrinsic motivation for learning in self improvement.
01:59:10.46 --> 01:59:23.02 The conclusion is they say the Marine Corps culture supports continuous career long learning.
01:59:25.02 --> 01:59:28.94 All Marines can facilitate learning. As Marines develop in their careers,
01:59:28.94 --> 01:59:34.22 the responsibility to facilitate learning also increases. Marine Corps culture embraces learning
01:59:34.22 --> 01:59:39.98 as fundamental to marine readiness to be the first to fight. Learning is essential to any
01:59:39.98 --> 01:59:45.90 present profession, but it is particularly important to the Marines' profession of arms
01:59:45.90 --> 01:59:50.78 with a cost of not learning. The cost of not learning are so steep.
01:59:53.90 --> 02:00:01.26 So that's chapter two. We're two hours deep right now in an order to not make a five-hour
02:00:01.26 --> 02:00:05.26 podcast. We will save the next four of the next podcast.
02:00:09.02 --> 02:00:20.94 So I guess echo Charles. Since we are going to try to continue to learn, continue to make
02:00:20.94 --> 02:00:29.98 continuous improvement. I don't know if there's any way that anything that you recommend
02:00:29.98 --> 02:00:36.62 we learn, perhaps? Sure. That could move us in the right direction. I recommend that we learn
02:00:36.62 --> 02:00:43.50 Jujitsu. One of the many recommendations. That we're coming. We stand the path. This is a
02:00:43.50 --> 02:00:46.86 real general way of putting it. So we're going to learn Jujitsu. We're going to stay in shape
02:00:47.74 --> 02:00:53.58 if not get in shape. We're going to stay functional and healthy. Functional, maybe that's a
02:00:53.58 --> 02:00:57.26 played out. Not played out, but that's maybe an overused word. We're going to say capable. How
02:00:57.26 --> 02:01:03.74 about that? Dave Burke. Good. I'm good at functional. I like capable. I like capable. Yeah.
02:01:03.74 --> 02:01:08.62 If you like capable, why did you say functional and then like deride it and then now you're
02:01:08.62 --> 02:01:14.54 calling it capable? I'm putting a what he called a fine point on it, like sharpening it. Like
02:01:14.54 --> 02:01:20.06 functional is like sure. Yes, functional. But let me get more specific capable. Okay. Even though that's
02:01:20.06 --> 02:01:26.46 pretty general. But to do these things, we're going to need what we're going to want certain tools.
02:01:26.46 --> 02:01:31.90 Okay. So for Jujitsu, we need a G. Rashcard. Boom. Where do we get the G. I think we are not all
02:01:31.90 --> 02:01:37.74 know, Basky in the world. Factually origin. Origin main.com. This is where you can look at all this stuff.
02:01:37.74 --> 02:01:48.94 Now, can we get G. Is it origin? Write this moment on in April 2020. Yeah. Can we? There are some
02:01:48.94 --> 02:01:53.58 G's still a bit. Look, we've done a little. We've had to make some adjustments to what we're
02:01:53.58 --> 02:02:03.02 doing in Maine because America needed certain items to get through the COVID-19 pandemic. So we had to
02:02:03.02 --> 02:02:08.54 adjust, make some adjustments and start making face coverings, which we are doing at a rapid pace,
02:02:09.34 --> 02:02:16.70 probably between 5 and 7,000 a day. The demand signal is very high. And so we are trying to get
02:02:16.70 --> 02:02:23.50 America what they need on those and look, they're not N95 masks, but at which we don't have the capability
02:02:23.50 --> 02:02:29.82 of making, which is why we weren't making any masks. But when the government and the CDC recommended
02:02:29.82 --> 02:02:33.66 face coverings for everyone, we started making face coverings. So that's what we're doing right now.
02:02:35.10 --> 02:02:39.82 As soon as we push through this, and as soon as really as other manufacturers pick up the slack,
02:02:41.90 --> 02:02:47.58 because we were able to move very quickly because we have the entire supply chain right there.
02:02:47.58 --> 02:02:54.14 We have the skills and capability. Okay, the ability all day. You know, we got crafts people up there
02:02:54.14 --> 02:02:58.86 that can go, oh, you want me to sew that cool. We can make that happen. Pete can design it. Okay,
02:02:58.86 --> 02:03:04.94 done. Pattern makers can make the patterns. Like we can get it done. And that went, the original
02:03:05.90 --> 02:03:10.94 death masks was Friday. We're talking about Monday. They're getting produced. There's not
02:03:10.94 --> 02:03:17.58 I don't think there's any businesses in the world that could do what Orange and just did right there.
02:03:19.58 --> 02:03:25.34 I'm going to say that again, on Friday, we're making rashguards on Monday morning full production
02:03:25.34 --> 02:03:31.98 of face coverings. So hey, look, but as soon as just as we pivoted quickly into that,
02:03:32.62 --> 02:03:39.34 as soon as some other manufacturers get caught up and people and the demand gets met will be right back
02:03:39.34 --> 02:03:45.42 to doing what we do and what we do, which is make stuff make a peril. So,
02:03:45.42 --> 02:03:51.26 just to a peril rashguards, keys, jeans, t-shirts, boots will be right back on all that stuff.
02:03:52.06 --> 02:03:57.34 So, you know, just be on standby. Yeah, good stuff for that. Again,
02:03:57.34 --> 02:04:01.34 OriginMain.com. Also at Origin,
02:04:01.34 --> 02:04:08.54 Jockel fuel. So, this will keep us capable. Keep us in the game. Look after our joints when we're
02:04:08.54 --> 02:04:14.22 lifting. It's a big deal. So, I'm saying. So, joint warfare, super-cryl oil.
02:04:14.94 --> 02:04:20.14 Samantha, oxygen to them, by the way. Also, Malk additional protein, protein, supplement.
02:04:20.14 --> 02:04:24.30 Are you showing the strawberry malk train? Yes. Really?
02:04:26.14 --> 02:04:29.02 Yes. How much do you have one a day? One a day.
02:04:29.02 --> 02:04:36.54 Okay. Sometimes, too. On some rare occasion, I will have a- How many scoops per per day?
02:04:36.54 --> 02:04:43.74 I'm a one scoop milk shaken in the bottle. Yeah. I don't do any other weird stuff for things.
02:04:44.30 --> 02:04:48.54 But there are times and I'm not going to waddy it. I've got a little extra time with my wife.
02:04:48.54 --> 02:04:53.90 Maybe watching TV a little bit on a Saturday night more than I have in the past because of what's going on.
02:04:53.90 --> 02:04:59.34 And I need a little- You know what? I need straight up made dessert.
02:04:59.34 --> 02:05:04.94 And I would just go back to the maltrain. So, that's my dessert. Saturday nights.
02:05:04.94 --> 02:05:09.34 I've had maybe a little extra these days. But during the day, do SOP for me is like, I will do malk.
02:05:09.98 --> 02:05:14.94 And what discipline in the can is your preferred flavor? Discipline in the can,
02:05:14.94 --> 02:05:19.50 deck savage with that question. Not the other two are fine, but given the choice, and I'm lucky enough
02:05:19.50 --> 02:05:24.86 to be one of those people that I have a choice. I have options. Decode on my request to deck savage.
02:05:24.86 --> 02:05:31.02 Just my thing. Interesting. How often do you drink one of those? One a day. What time?
02:05:33.66 --> 02:05:39.98 Usually, just a little bit after lunch. So, another thing is, I'm sitting in my desk longer during the day
02:05:39.98 --> 02:05:43.58 than I ever really have because usually, several days a week, I'm traveling. I'm going to hotel. I'm with
02:05:43.58 --> 02:05:49.42 client, I'm on a plane. And now I'm like, up in the morning, work out, get ready. And I sit down on my desk.
02:05:49.42 --> 02:05:54.14 And sometimes I'm sitting, literally sitting in my desk sometimes like 6, 7, 8 hours straight.
02:05:54.14 --> 02:05:57.74 Which I have, I typically don't do. Not normal. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. We're on
02:05:57.74 --> 02:06:02.94 one webinars, one podcasts. We're in the game, and I'm at my computer at that chair. And
02:06:04.22 --> 02:06:09.82 these, I say, ready to deploy, ready to drink cans. There's a deck savage. I get up, lunch, come
02:06:09.82 --> 02:06:15.26 upstairs. I don't usually eat a lunch. I don't really have a meal for lunch. I will have a
02:06:15.26 --> 02:06:20.62 deck savage shortly after lunch time. What do you feel when you, when you, once you've digested it,
02:06:20.62 --> 02:06:29.82 what do you feel? I feel good. What it really does for me is if I don't take it, I catch myself like,
02:06:29.82 --> 02:06:37.02 not, I catch myself mid early afternoon, wanting to not do what I'm doing. Now, a little breather,
02:06:37.02 --> 02:06:41.18 they're on a take a look. I'm going to push away and I'm like, nope, I'm not, I do not have time to do that.
02:06:41.18 --> 02:06:44.70 I take that, it's kind of almost like science at this point. I take that little hitter,
02:06:44.70 --> 02:06:47.98 and I'm in the game, and I can push through whatever that normally would be. The, hey,
02:06:47.98 --> 02:06:51.18 want you step away and kind of get some fresh air. I like, yeah, I'd love to. I would love to
02:06:51.18 --> 02:06:54.86 go do that. They're the football with my kids. And I try to do that sometimes. But right now,
02:06:54.86 --> 02:07:01.26 dude, April 20th, 2020, dude, we are grinding. Like, we are grinding at our, at our desk. That's what
02:07:01.26 --> 02:07:08.62 we're doing. This is the key. Yeah, I know to say, I will. So I'll get up. I'll have, I'll work out.
02:07:08.62 --> 02:07:12.62 I'll left. I'll have a handful of macadamia nuts or something. So now it's, you know,
02:07:14.22 --> 02:07:16.94 eight o'clock nine o'clock in the morning. So when I start feeling a little hunger,
02:07:17.82 --> 02:07:23.34 and, you know, now when I'm sitting through my morning calls, whatever, talking to clients,
02:07:23.34 --> 02:07:31.42 I'm on the, I'm on the, um, just discipline powder, right, jockel Palmer. I'm just,
02:07:31.42 --> 02:07:33.66 I'm just kind of sipping. That's just kind of going through. It's just kind of,
02:07:33.66 --> 02:07:41.58 shhh, getting on step. And then, like, same thing around lunchtime. And usually, you know,
02:07:41.58 --> 02:07:45.50 whatever, I'll have a little gap in them. Like, okay, I got, I got an hour here. I got two hours
02:07:45.50 --> 02:07:49.34 here, and I'll go. I'm going to write, you know, I'm writing a book right now. So I'll be like,
02:07:49.34 --> 02:07:55.34 cool, but, but probably, as I know, I see that window approaching. Same thing, I'll be like, well,
02:07:56.86 --> 02:08:02.38 maybe it'd be a good time to check social media, or maybe be a good time to just turn my brain off.
02:08:03.10 --> 02:08:07.18 And you can feel that gravitational pull, right? So I go, oh, you know what?
02:08:08.70 --> 02:08:13.66 Crack it open 20 minutes, whatever, 30 minutes prior. Drink it. And what's cool is,
02:08:13.66 --> 02:08:18.86 I, it just happens that I get down a start hammering. And then a little while, I'm like,
02:08:18.86 --> 02:08:26.70 oh, what does have it? Because you get that little little little heater. So we got that.
02:08:26.70 --> 02:08:33.74 By the way, that's discipline go in a can discipline go or discipline powder form. That was
02:08:33.74 --> 02:08:40.14 the original. Yeah. And the jockel Palmer. Did I win away from powder when the cans came out?
02:08:40.14 --> 02:08:47.18 And when jockel Palmer came out, I went back to the back. Yeah, I stayed with the powder for a long time.
02:08:47.18 --> 02:08:55.18 Still going powder all day, every day. All day, every day. That's it. That's what I, I just stop.
02:08:55.18 --> 02:09:02.54 I, I won't have any discipline go in the can after two o'clock in the afternoon,
02:09:02.54 --> 02:09:07.66 three o'clock in the afternoon. Because then I'll just be, I'll be able to sleep, you know, so
02:09:07.66 --> 02:09:15.26 little cautious about that. Very true. Also, where your kid moke as well. Um, supplemental,
02:09:15.26 --> 02:09:20.30 dessert like protein. That's right. A lot of kids at home all day right now. Yes.
02:09:20.30 --> 02:09:24.30 They want a little bit of that. They want something that tastes good. Just get them some of that
02:09:24.30 --> 02:09:30.70 warrior kid moke. They think you're hooking them up. You are in a way. And you are in many ways
02:09:31.74 --> 02:09:36.14 from a taste perspective. You can get this stuff at vitamin chop too. Some of the vitamin
02:09:36.14 --> 02:09:44.30 chops if they're open. They got the full lineup. Um, cold war man. I talked about it last time.

02:10:46.86 --> 02:10:50.30 when we're representing on the path while we're learning. It's what I'm saying. Well,
02:10:50.30 --> 02:10:57.58 we're improving ourselves. So we're saying learning. In quarantine or not. See, we have a new

02:11:10.86 --> 02:11:15.90 from jokbo on this one. It's a controversial shirt is what it is. Sometimes decentralized command,
02:11:15.90 --> 02:11:20.22 you know, sometimes it goes too far. People start doing things below the chain of command. They're
02:11:20.22 --> 02:11:23.82 not running their approval and things are just happening.
02:11:25.26 --> 02:11:31.02 Okay, prove things are happening. Oh, yeah. So I'm below the chain. Yes. You're up the chain. Yes. I run it up. Yes.

02:11:46.46 --> 02:11:50.54 Apparently. No. I mean, I reread the text. I'm like, no, it doesn't get any more clear than that.
02:11:52.62 --> 02:11:59.18 Well, in this case, the people are essentially what you call that when you kind of, when you
02:11:59.18 --> 02:12:03.42 you don't overthrow them, but you assume it's saying, you know, one like the one government
02:12:03.42 --> 02:12:08.22 officials like, and then the people are like, well, you know, I don't know if we accept that,
02:12:08.22 --> 02:12:13.18 when we like it, you know, so the people. So there's a really really lovely view.

02:15:27.74 --> 02:15:33.42 echelon front leadership consultancy, which is what Dave talked about earlier. You want to know
02:15:33.42 --> 02:15:36.62 what we're doing all day right now. That's what we're doing. We are talking to our clients.
02:15:36.62 --> 02:15:45.42 20, 30, 40 people in a meeting. Four people in a meeting, one person in a meeting face to face.
02:15:45.42 --> 02:15:54.70 Is it legal? Dave Burke to say, I was on a zoom meeting with a client face to face. Yes.
02:15:54.70 --> 02:16:00.86 Because it's almost more face to face than when you're face to face. You're actually closer
02:16:00.86 --> 02:16:05.74 than normally would be where they'd be 30 feet away, sitting in some sort of classroom
02:16:05.74 --> 02:16:14.06 type scenario. Right. You are face to face and you are live. So we have adjusted our methodology
02:16:14.06 --> 02:16:20.06 at echelon front where we no longer will we will eventually go back and work face to face
02:16:20.06 --> 02:16:27.98 literally. But right now we are finding that the impact of this online virtual training
02:16:29.26 --> 02:16:34.06 is awesome. It allows us to have more interactions, closer interactions, more continuous
02:16:34.06 --> 02:16:39.02 interactions with the client. So if you need help in your business, aligning your leadership,
02:16:39.66 --> 02:16:45.82 go to echelon front.com for details. We also have EF online speaking of revamping.
02:16:46.94 --> 02:16:53.26 Look for a long time EF online was a static, but a static courses that you could go on there and
02:16:53.26 --> 02:16:57.66 take and they were static. They were they were interactive and you would run through scenarios.
02:16:57.66 --> 02:17:05.74 But it was pre-existing classes. So we've blown this thing wide open. We got live video webinars.
02:17:05.74 --> 02:17:11.10 We got Q&A is going on. We got immediate action drills on there. I got leadership primers. Just
02:17:12.06 --> 02:17:17.90 totally revamp that we also changed the whole pricing structure. They used to be like you're going
02:17:17.90 --> 02:17:21.58 to pay to take a class almost like you were going to college for a semester and you're going to
02:17:21.58 --> 02:17:26.94 learn these things. Now it's like, oh way cheaper subscription model or you can pay it once,
02:17:26.94 --> 02:17:31.02 but it's like boom come in and you're part of the gang and you're interacting with me. You're
02:17:31.02 --> 02:17:34.70 interacting with Dave. You're interacting with JP Lave. Mike's really the whole crew.

02:17:43.74 --> 02:17:52.38 to him as as Dave just said you'll be five inches away from his face. So that's what we're doing
02:17:52.38 --> 02:17:59.98 there. EF online.com. Check that out. We've got the musters, the Orlando muster was canceled.

02:18:13.58 --> 02:18:17.34 Everything that we've done is sold out. We were going to do three now we're only doing two.
02:18:17.34 --> 02:18:20.78 So they're going to sell it even quicker. A bunch of people are already going and move their
02:18:20.78 --> 02:18:27.66 reservations. So if you want to come and extreme ownership.com for that. And then there's EF
02:18:27.66 --> 02:18:34.06 Overwatch where we take executive leadership from the military and place them into the civilian
02:18:34.06 --> 02:18:43.10 sector and then EF Legion.com. These are frontline leaders that are being placed into civilian
02:18:43.10 --> 02:18:47.34 companies. If you're and let me tell you if you're a vet right now there's a lot of companies
02:18:47.34 --> 02:18:52.22 that are out there hiring go to eFleagent.com and just enter yourself in there. So you get
02:18:52.22 --> 02:18:57.42 looked at. So people can see that you're available for employment. We got to hide demands signal
02:18:57.42 --> 02:19:03.10 from our companies that we work with that are reaching out looking for squared away veterans that
02:19:03.10 --> 02:19:09.34 understand the principles we talk about to go to eFleagent.com and enroll yourself. And if you
02:19:09.34 --> 02:19:19.90 haven't had enough of my tyrannical utterances or echoes delirious theories or Dave's over
02:19:19.90 --> 02:19:28.94 articulated speeches, then you can locate us on the inner webs on Twitter on Instagram and
02:19:28.94 --> 02:19:35.58 on Dine Freezy Bond. Dave is that David Arbork. I always add echo Charles and I am at Jocko
02:19:35.58 --> 02:19:40.94 willing to all you out there in uniform serving now or if you've ever served in the Army, Navy,
02:19:40.94 --> 02:19:48.06 Air Force or of course the Marine Corps. We salute you and your service and sacrifice for freedom
02:19:48.06 --> 02:19:52.86 and to the police law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers,
02:19:52.86 --> 02:20:01.34 border patrol and secret service. All you first responders thank you for your service here at home,
02:20:01.34 --> 02:20:07.58 taking care of us and to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel that are in the fight right now,
02:20:08.46 --> 02:20:18.62 battling against disease and despair. Thank you for your brave hearts and your benevolent hearts.
02:20:21.10 --> 02:20:29.18 And to everyone else out there, just remember what the Marine Corps teaches us that combat is a combination
02:20:29.18 --> 02:20:37.02 of fear, uncertainty, ambiguity, chance, horror and friction and life is much the same.
02:20:39.26 --> 02:20:45.50 Continuous learning is essential because it allows you to recognize, change, adapt to it
02:20:46.62 --> 02:20:53.50 and make decisions that lead to victory and failing to learn simply means failing.
02:20:53.50 --> 02:21:05.66 To win, you have to learn, so read, study, get experience, listen and live with a bias toward action.
02:21:08.22 --> 02:21:18.94 And be mind that is desperate to learn. And then, well, go out there and get after it.
02:21:18.94 --> 02:21:23.18 And until next time, this is Dave, Henako and Jocco.
