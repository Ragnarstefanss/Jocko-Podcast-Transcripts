00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.80
This is Jocco podcast number 84 with echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.

2
00:00:08.80 --> 00:00:09.80
Good evening echo.

3
00:00:09.80 --> 00:00:14.08
Good evening.

4
00:00:14.08 --> 00:00:21.72
Gentlemen, your life expectancy from the day you join your battalion will be precisely

5
00:00:21.72 --> 00:00:24.68
three weeks.

6
00:00:24.68 --> 00:00:31.08
The Florida mustache major who addressed us at the small reinforcement camp a few miles

7
00:00:31.08 --> 00:00:36.68
from Bayou obviously had misplaced how to misplace sense of humor.

8
00:00:36.68 --> 00:00:39.08
Or he should have been sacked.

9
00:00:39.08 --> 00:00:42.96
On second thought, he definitely should have been sacked.

10
00:00:42.96 --> 00:00:49.28
Not that any of the dozen infantry subalterns took the slightest notice of what to us with

11
00:00:49.28 --> 00:00:56.28
the ramblings of an old fool. He was probably no more than 40.

12
00:00:56.28 --> 00:01:03.08
The fourth battalion, the summer set light infantry was in one twenty nine brigade and

13
00:01:03.08 --> 00:01:11.76
was a pre-war territorial army battalion with close links with Bristol and Bath.

14
00:01:11.76 --> 00:01:21.26
In the United Kingdom till late June 1944 it was a close knit unit which had almost been

15
00:01:21.26 --> 00:01:26.16
decimated within a period of 48 hours.

16
00:01:26.16 --> 00:01:34.52
On fifth of July, three officers and 62 other ranks were required as reinforcements.

17
00:01:34.52 --> 00:01:41.64
Between the 14th and the 18th of July, a further 12 officers of whom I was one and

18
00:01:41.64 --> 00:01:50.20
479 other ranks arrived and even then the battalion was still below its full strength of 36

19
00:01:50.20 --> 00:01:55.96
officers and nearly 700 NCOs and men.

20
00:01:55.96 --> 00:02:01.24
This will give some idea of the appalling level of infantry casualties which had to be

21
00:02:01.24 --> 00:02:09.76
accepted in order to enlarge the slender and vulnerable Normandy beachhead.

22
00:02:09.76 --> 00:02:16.20
As I had the had had previous experience of six pounder anti tank guns, the commanding

23
00:02:16.20 --> 00:02:22.96
officer, Lippi, Lieutenant Colonel C. G. Lipscomb, posted me as second in command to the

24
00:02:22.96 --> 00:02:28.16
battalion's anti tank platoon which consisted of six guns.

25
00:02:28.16 --> 00:02:33.08
But my stay with that platoon was short and I was quickly sucked into the real infantry

26
00:02:33.08 --> 00:02:40.96
battle as commander of 18 platoon in D company on the 31st of July immediately after the

27
00:02:40.96 --> 00:02:48.24
battle of Briskersarred D company had just lost their commander Tim Brathweigh, lost a

28
00:02:48.24 --> 00:02:58.60
foot and gained a military cross and 18 platoon their commander.

29
00:02:58.60 --> 00:03:05.44
So that right there is the beginning of a book that we're going to look at today.

30
00:03:05.44 --> 00:03:07.52
It's called 18 platoon.

31
00:03:07.52 --> 00:03:17.36
It's written by a guy named Sydney Jerry, J.A.R. Y. who was born in Essex in 1924.

32
00:03:17.36 --> 00:03:27.40
When the army in 1942 was a private soldier in 1943 he was commissioned and from 19 from July

33
00:03:27.40 --> 00:03:35.68
of 1944 until June of 1945 he served as the platoon commander for 18 platoon.

34
00:03:35.68 --> 00:03:45.56
And the chances of survival for an infantry subaltern in a rifle company during the

35
00:03:45.56 --> 00:03:51.92
campaign in northwest Europe or slim most survived for only a few weeks.

36
00:03:51.92 --> 00:03:59.86
Sydney Jerry survived 10 months from July 1944 when he took command of 18 platoon in

37
00:03:59.86 --> 00:04:06.32
Normandy until the end of the war near Bremen in early May of 1945.

38
00:04:06.32 --> 00:04:15.04
So this guy this is this is amazing this guy, Sydney Jerry he's the only platoon commander

39
00:04:15.04 --> 00:04:22.84
in the British second army to survive as a platoon commander from Normandy to the German

40
00:04:22.84 --> 00:04:30.60
surrender one guy, one guy, and this is the guy.

41
00:04:30.60 --> 00:04:39.04
It's amazing and you're going to see that his attitude is I mean the lessons that he learned

42
00:04:39.04 --> 00:04:44.28
he was young coming in he was 20 years old 20-year old platoon commander coming in in

43
00:04:44.28 --> 00:04:48.32
the experience kind of lived a sheltered life you got to check out some pictures of him

44
00:04:48.32 --> 00:04:53.76
he has that look to he looks like you know sheltered looks like a little young whipper

45
00:04:53.76 --> 00:04:56.76
snapper.

46
00:04:56.76 --> 00:05:01.96
So we'll go back to the book here as he breaks down what a platoon was at this time.

47
00:05:01.96 --> 00:05:06.96
In 1944 the war establishment of a British infantry platoon was 36 men.

48
00:05:06.96 --> 00:05:11.52
It consisted of three rifle sections each of 10 men including a bread gunner each

49
00:05:11.52 --> 00:05:16.56
commanded by a corpel or sometimes a land sergeant there was also a small platoon head

50
00:05:16.56 --> 00:05:25.24
quarters with a two inch mortar detachment a p-out which was of anti tank weapon.

51
00:05:25.24 --> 00:05:36.60
The platoon sergeant and the commanders Batman slash runner on July 31st 18 platoon consisted

52
00:05:36.60 --> 00:05:42.56
of 17 all ranks 12 of whom were recent reinforcements.

53
00:05:42.56 --> 00:05:48.92
He'll one 12 and brick cigar had claimed the rest.

54
00:05:48.92 --> 00:05:56.28
So think about that you're supposed to have 36 people in your platoon and they have 17

55
00:05:56.28 --> 00:06:04.96
of which 12 are replacements which means that 29 people had been casualties.

56
00:06:04.96 --> 00:06:08.04
There's seven people that had been either killed or wounded.

57
00:06:08.04 --> 00:06:11.84
There's sorry seven people out of this 36 that hadn't been killed or wounded that remained

58
00:06:11.84 --> 00:06:13.12
in the platoon right now.

59
00:06:13.12 --> 00:06:16.92
So that's what we're talking about here.

60
00:06:16.92 --> 00:06:19.92
And again he's coming in no combat experience.

61
00:06:19.92 --> 00:06:21.28
He rolls in and we're going back to the book.

62
00:06:21.28 --> 00:06:29.000
I sensed instantly that a tight grip was required particularly so because those few who survived

63
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.60
till one 12 had witnessed what was without a doubt the most horrific tragedy that befell

64
00:06:35.60 --> 00:06:42.20
the battalion during the entire campaign.

65
00:06:42.20 --> 00:06:44.08
So he's about to explain what they had been through.

66
00:06:44.08 --> 00:06:47.96
He wasn't there for it but he knew and he had heard what they had been through.

67
00:06:47.96 --> 00:06:52.76
And I'm going to say that again this is the most horrific tragedy for the entire campaign.

68
00:06:52.76 --> 00:06:55.76
This is what they're coming off of and this is who he's going to take over for.

69
00:06:55.76 --> 00:06:57.48
This is what they had been through.

70
00:06:57.48 --> 00:07:02.40
Back to the book during a company night attack one of our soldiers had been hit in the lower

71
00:07:02.40 --> 00:07:06.000
chest by a rifle or machine gun bullet.

72
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.20
Passing through his body it had not killed him outright.

73
00:07:10.20 --> 00:07:16.32
The bullets devilish course lay through the soldiers webbing equipment pouch which contained

74
00:07:16.32 --> 00:07:23.72
a 77 phosphorus smoke grenade which exploded.

75
00:07:23.72 --> 00:07:31.16
But on barbed wire the poor soldier laid disemboweled for all around to see his writhing body

76
00:07:31.16 --> 00:07:37.64
a smoking mass of burning phosphorus.

77
00:07:37.64 --> 00:07:43.64
Responding to his agonized screams to put him out of his misery his platoon commander shot

78
00:07:43.64 --> 00:07:46.84
him through the heart.

79
00:07:46.84 --> 00:07:53.20
And finally through the head after the poor man's final frenzyed pleas.

80
00:07:53.20 --> 00:08:00.80
Their sir through the head.

81
00:08:00.80 --> 00:08:07.32
Doug Proctor was witness to this sublimely courageous incident which seared itself upon all

82
00:08:07.32 --> 00:08:13.32
our hearts.

83
00:08:13.32 --> 00:08:15.76
So that's what you're going to take over for.

84
00:08:15.76 --> 00:08:17.76
Can you do that?

85
00:08:17.76 --> 00:08:22.48
I mean is that like legal you know like if they found out that that happened.

86
00:08:22.48 --> 00:08:26.68
I have no idea what the legal ramifications are.

87
00:08:26.68 --> 00:08:36.40
But the moral weight on the shoulders of the men that witness that is unbelievably.

88
00:08:36.40 --> 00:08:43.000
It's hard to imagine what that feels like.

89
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.44
Back to the book to the NCOs.

90
00:08:45.44 --> 00:08:51.40
Sergeant Jim Kingston and Corporal Doug Proctor immediately reported to me and explained

91
00:08:51.40 --> 00:08:56.04
that forcefully and in great detail the poor stayed the platoon as they knew it to be.

92
00:08:56.04 --> 00:09:00.60
So you've got these guys these are the senior enlisted guys in the platoon Jim Kingston

93
00:09:00.60 --> 00:09:03.28
and Doug Proctor and you're going to hear a lot about them.

94
00:09:03.28 --> 00:09:04.28
And they're coming to him.

95
00:09:04.28 --> 00:09:07.52
Here's this new guy checking in and they're coming to him and they're you know telling

96
00:09:07.52 --> 00:09:12.24
him how what what a bad state the platoon is in.

97
00:09:12.24 --> 00:09:16.68
Back to the book while they did so I was conscious of being weighed up was I fit to be

98
00:09:16.68 --> 00:09:18.64
their platoon commander.

99
00:09:18.64 --> 00:09:24.44
They were responsible anxious and discriminating NCOs that stands for non-commissioned officer.

100
00:09:24.44 --> 00:09:31.000
It's the senior enlisted guys and my apprenticeship was to start immediately.

101
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.84
They were startled by my attire previously warned by a young officer who'd fought in

102
00:09:35.84 --> 00:09:41.000
Tunisia that battle dress was most unsuitable for brat battle.

103
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.44
I'd come prepared and sand colored corduroy trousers and a stout pullover not unlike that

104
00:09:46.44 --> 00:09:49.28
now warned throughout the army.

105
00:09:49.28 --> 00:09:54.96
Among my prejudices was an acute dislike of steel helmets they gave me headaches.

106
00:09:54.96 --> 00:10:00.16
On exercises in England I had been obliged to wear one but the surge of individualism

107
00:10:00.16 --> 00:10:04.56
which now engulfed me convinced me that this was an article of equipment best left out

108
00:10:04.56 --> 00:10:06.52
of battle.

109
00:10:06.52 --> 00:10:10.12
So he's he shows up and he's kind of dressed out of uniform.

110
00:10:10.12 --> 00:10:14.32
Doesn't want to wear his helmet wearing corduroy pants.

111
00:10:14.32 --> 00:10:18.08
Back to the book Battle School's in England had insisted that off infantry officers should

112
00:10:18.08 --> 00:10:22.92
wear the same equipment and dress as their soldiers the idea being that they could not

113
00:10:22.92 --> 00:10:27.52
be then be so easily identified by enemy snipers.

114
00:10:27.52 --> 00:10:32.44
They also decreed that one should carry a rifle or a stand gun.

115
00:10:32.44 --> 00:10:34.28
Clearly this was ridiculous.

116
00:10:34.28 --> 00:10:38.32
How on earth could your own soldiers recognize you in the heat of battle if you went through

117
00:10:38.32 --> 00:10:40.16
such lengths to disguise?

118
00:10:40.16 --> 00:10:46.48
He had the same attitude as Lieutenant Lee in Korea that was wearing the orange vest you

119
00:10:46.48 --> 00:10:48.48
remember that?

120
00:10:48.48 --> 00:10:52.52
So he could be identified in battle by his own men.

121
00:10:52.52 --> 00:10:54.60
That's what this guy's attitude is like I'm not going to dress like everyone else

122
00:10:54.60 --> 00:10:57.56
they need to beat they need to know who that I'm out there.

123
00:10:57.56 --> 00:10:59.48
They need to be able to see me.

124
00:10:59.48 --> 00:11:00.48
Back to the book.

125
00:11:00.48 --> 00:11:05.48
I dispense with the rifle or stand gun too because I'm hopelessly short sighted and I did

126
00:11:05.48 --> 00:11:10.96
not fancy trying to command a platoon while got up like a Christmas tree meaning covered

127
00:11:10.96 --> 00:11:12.36
in a bunch of gear.

128
00:11:12.36 --> 00:11:17.56
As a concession to impending battle I sported a 45-colt automatic pistol with two spare

129
00:11:17.56 --> 00:11:20.20
magazines.

130
00:11:20.20 --> 00:11:24.32
The 38-n field revolver then general issue throughout the army managed to combine total

131
00:11:24.32 --> 00:11:26.92
mechanical liability with complete ineffectiveness.

132
00:11:26.92 --> 00:11:34.68
I once fired chick shots from one at a target pinned to a plywood board none of which even

133
00:11:34.68 --> 00:11:37.32
penetrated the board.

134
00:11:37.32 --> 00:11:40.68
Neither did I hit the target which gave me little confidence in this weapon.

135
00:11:40.68 --> 00:11:44.28
The nine pounds I paid for the cult proved a sound investment.

136
00:11:44.28 --> 00:11:50.12
So there's a lot of people that like to talk about what type of side arm there you've got

137
00:11:50.12 --> 00:11:56.40
a big proponent for the cult 45 the old classic.

138
00:11:56.40 --> 00:12:00.40
Again important to remember that he's not even carrying a rifle because he knows his job

139
00:12:00.40 --> 00:12:06.20
of sleep and I used to do it when we had seals seal leaders that would spend too much

140
00:12:06.20 --> 00:12:07.68
time on their gun.

141
00:12:07.68 --> 00:12:11.04
I would say hey you know what they used to carry in the Marine Corps in the army.

142
00:12:11.04 --> 00:12:14.48
If you were leader you know what they'd carry the carry a pistol.

143
00:12:14.48 --> 00:12:16.52
So give me your rifle and we take it from them.

144
00:12:16.52 --> 00:12:20.92
You need to be leading not shooting.

145
00:12:20.92 --> 00:12:22.56
Lave talks about that a lot.

146
00:12:22.56 --> 00:12:27.52
Yeah it's very you know Lave talks about his mentality which was he wants to shoot.

147
00:12:27.52 --> 00:12:29.32
He's from Texas.

148
00:12:29.32 --> 00:12:33.64
You know he wants to shoot his gun and he realized hey I'm not here to shoot my gun.

149
00:12:33.64 --> 00:12:38.40
I'm here to you know be at high port and be off my gun and leading.

150
00:12:38.40 --> 00:12:44.64
That's my job and these guys took it to the point where they're not even carrying a rifle.

151
00:12:44.64 --> 00:12:47.56
Now he's talking about a senior leadership a little bit his enlisted leadership.

152
00:12:47.56 --> 00:12:53.24
Back to the book Jim Kingston was short, quiet and shy with the shootness of a countryman

153
00:12:53.24 --> 00:12:57.28
although he had lived and worked in Bristol all his life.

154
00:12:57.28 --> 00:13:02.60
He barely raised his voice but had total command over his section.

155
00:13:02.60 --> 00:13:07.32
There was no argument with Jim that that's another thing you'd find about this book.

156
00:13:07.32 --> 00:13:14.68
This book it it it takes so many stereotypes from from from Sydney Jerry on down like

157
00:13:14.68 --> 00:13:18.76
the stereotypes are just out the window of the way this between was and there's a classic

158
00:13:18.76 --> 00:13:23.96
example you know you picture the senior listed guy this you know gunny highway scenario

159
00:13:23.96 --> 00:13:26.24
not happening.

160
00:13:26.24 --> 00:13:31.000
Now he talks about Doug Proctor back to the book Doug Proctor although a summer set came from

161
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.12
notting him.

162
00:13:33.12 --> 00:13:39.36
Also short he was positive direct with unfailing common sense and like Jim quietly

163
00:13:39.36 --> 00:13:42.64
dominated his section.

164
00:13:42.64 --> 00:13:46.32
So there's another and I got to see some great leaders.

165
00:13:46.32 --> 00:13:50.16
There's some guys that were in where in to you bruiser that were quiet when they were

166
00:13:50.16 --> 00:13:55.44
in to you bruiser and when I was putting them through their next workup I was thinking

167
00:13:55.44 --> 00:13:58.48
myself hey are they going to be able to step up and lead and that's exactly how they did

168
00:13:58.48 --> 00:14:04.88
it right there they were just like quiet professional and controlling but they run their

169
00:14:04.88 --> 00:14:08.52
mouth to get it done.

170
00:14:08.52 --> 00:14:14.48
Back to the book I had not previously met any platoon like this one they were quiet

171
00:14:14.48 --> 00:14:20.60
thoughtful and unabraceive soldiers there was little swearing and there existed a tranquility

172
00:14:20.60 --> 00:14:24.08
in their relationships with one another.

173
00:14:24.08 --> 00:14:28.72
Their eyes implored me not to fail them.

174
00:14:28.72 --> 00:14:35.28
Two factors were immediately apparent firstly the platoon required quiet firm and confident

175
00:14:35.28 --> 00:14:37.84
leadership.

176
00:14:37.84 --> 00:14:42.000
So that's a good assessment you know you can see these guys don't need anybody yelling

177
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.32
at him and here's the second point secondly if I failed to use my imagination and

178
00:14:48.32 --> 00:14:54.72
slavishly followed the battle school drills most of the platoon would not survive another

179
00:14:54.72 --> 00:14:56.72
major battle.

180
00:14:56.72 --> 00:15:01.44
So all the things he learned the standard typical stuff that he learned that wasn't

181
00:15:01.44 --> 00:15:06.64
an work and it hadn't worked that's why they had so many replacements come in.

182
00:15:06.64 --> 00:15:11.04
Back to the book in fact the problem that faced me with 18 platoon was identical to the

183
00:15:11.04 --> 00:15:16.80
one facing general Montgomery army group commander how to fight and defeat the cream of the

184
00:15:16.80 --> 00:15:24.48
SS Panzer divisions in the closed Normandy Bokaj and still retained sufficient infantry riflemen

185
00:15:24.48 --> 00:15:27.44
to live in fight tomorrow.

186
00:15:27.44 --> 00:15:33.52
The problem was a difficult one obviously I must set an example and always lead from the front

187
00:15:33.52 --> 00:15:40.64
however if I became over eager and got myself killed or wounded the whole object of my previous

188
00:15:40.64 --> 00:15:44.88
training and my responsibility to my platoon would be cast away.

189
00:15:44.88 --> 00:15:49.76
I would in fact be letting down a team platoon so he knows he's got to lead from the front

190
00:15:49.76 --> 00:15:52.16
same time he knows he's got to stay alive.

191
00:15:52.16 --> 00:15:58.16
He knows he got to stay alive and this Normandy fighting here he talks about Normandy being

192
00:15:58.16 --> 00:16:04.72
a defender's paradise meaning when you're on the defense and Normandy it's it's a paradise

193
00:16:04.72 --> 00:16:09.52
for the people on defense which was the Germans back to the book we fought from one head

194
00:16:09.52 --> 00:16:15.68
road to the next up torturous overgrown sunken lanes ideal country for the German defender

195
00:16:15.68 --> 00:16:22.80
but a palling for attacking infantry however no arm but infantry could take and hold the Normandy

196
00:16:22.80 --> 00:16:28.32
Bokaj Bokaj is like a trees shrubs mankled together.

197
00:16:31.04 --> 00:16:36.16
It was here that I served my apprenticeship and the platoon developed its character which despite

198
00:16:36.16 --> 00:16:40.96
constant depletion by casualties over the coming ten months it would retain until the end of the war.

199
00:16:42.40 --> 00:16:49.76
It was also here that in perceptibly I became possessive with a tain platoon it was mine

200
00:16:49.76 --> 00:16:56.32
to be guarded with an almost maternal jealousy that resented all criticism of my soldiers.

201
00:16:57.84 --> 00:17:00.24
That's building at this point.

202
00:17:00.24 --> 00:17:09.92
Hmm, most important it was in the Bokaj that I began to appreciate how vital is grip

203
00:17:11.76 --> 00:17:17.52
grip on oneself grip on one soldiers and grip on the situation.

204
00:17:20.24 --> 00:17:25.60
Unlike characters in novels and films most men react nervously to real battle conditions

205
00:17:25.60 --> 00:17:35.36
discipline and regimental pride are supports but in decisive moments of great danger the grip of the

206
00:17:35.36 --> 00:17:44.16
leader on the lead is paramount. Infantry section in platoon commanders must possess the minds and

207
00:17:44.16 --> 00:17:50.88
hearts of their soldiers. Strength of character is not enough successful leadership in battle

208
00:17:50.88 --> 00:17:55.92
although complex and intangible always seem to me to depend on two factors.

209
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.36
Firstly soldiers must have confidence in their leaders professional ability and secondly they must

210
00:18:05.36 --> 00:18:12.32
trust them as men. So there you go they gotta have confidence in your ability and trust.

211
00:18:14.24 --> 00:18:19.20
And this trust topic comes up all the time and I use the the word relationships

212
00:18:19.20 --> 00:18:24.96
kind of interchangeably with trust. I always have to remind myself to point that out that when I'm

213
00:18:24.96 --> 00:18:29.20
talking about relationships and building relationships and business on the battlefield in life

214
00:18:30.08 --> 00:18:35.44
relationships are a trust that's what they are. We build your relationship on trust and I guess you could have

215
00:18:36.32 --> 00:18:40.32
you know relationships that aren't built on trust that there was like another thing you know

216
00:18:40.32 --> 00:18:44.56
I have a relationship with that guy but you know but that's not the one that's what I'm talking about

217
00:18:44.56 --> 00:18:48.88
about. I'm a good relationship. Yeah. Those are based on trust and those are obviously

218
00:18:50.16 --> 00:18:56.000
the the second most important thing to him. So first is confidence in their ability and second is trust.

219
00:18:58.32 --> 00:19:02.48
I like this part. It helps too if a leader has the reputation of being lucky.

220
00:19:04.16 --> 00:19:10.08
Field Marshal Montgomery placed great importance on the principle of making the enemy dance to your tune.

221
00:19:10.08 --> 00:19:17.68
No where is this more important than in Poutooning Company Battle? It is decisive because if you do not

222
00:19:17.68 --> 00:19:24.88
dominate events your enemy will. There you go. That's your jits. You're right there. Be

223
00:19:24.88 --> 00:19:30.72
first. Be first. Be first. Yeah. You gotta be first. You gotta dictate the pace. You gotta you gotta be proactive.

224
00:19:30.72 --> 00:19:40.72
Hmm. Back to the book Sound Leadership like True Love to which I suspect it is closely related

225
00:19:40.72 --> 00:19:49.04
is all powerful. It can overcome the seemingly impossible and it's effect on both leader and

226
00:19:49.04 --> 00:19:56.40
lead is profound and lasting. Even after the passage of 40 years, brief mention of the battalions

227
00:19:56.40 --> 00:20:02.48
finest officers and NCOs bring brings a smile to the faces of the survivors of my Poutoon.

228
00:20:03.84 --> 00:20:10.56
Their resentment of those who failed to lead when it mattered most still runs astonishingly deep.

229
00:20:12.24 --> 00:20:19.28
So leadership can overcome seemingly impossible. This is why leadership is the most important

230
00:20:19.28 --> 00:20:28.16
thing on the battlefield. Now he's going into his. So that's kind of his assessment and this is

231
00:20:28.16 --> 00:20:33.04
based on his experience which we're about to get into. Then he does more assessments. There's more

232
00:20:33.04 --> 00:20:37.36
more he talks more about what he learns about leadership as a whole. But you have to kind of

233
00:20:37.36 --> 00:20:43.44
understand what he went through and figure out where he learned it from. The first, his first command

234
00:20:43.44 --> 00:20:50.40
in battle here we go back to the book. We were to attack this rugged hill from the west with the

235
00:20:50.40 --> 00:20:56.40
fifth wheelchairs on our right and the fourth wheelchairs in reserves. The approach march to our

236
00:20:56.40 --> 00:21:01.76
forming up place had been a nightmare of swirling a brace of dust, shelling and the stench

237
00:21:01.76 --> 00:21:09.04
of exhaust fumes from the tanks which transported us forward. We were due to attack at 1500 hours

238
00:21:09.04 --> 00:21:16.08
with a company leading on the right and B company on the left. We followed B company. B company

239
00:21:16.08 --> 00:21:22.08
moved off quickly with our company deployed about 300 yards behind. Their forward platoon

240
00:21:22.08 --> 00:21:28.24
had barely crossed the stream when concentrated spend outfire came from the front and from both

241
00:21:28.24 --> 00:21:35.20
flanks. So spend outfire. This is kind of a generic term that the brits used for German machine guns.

242
00:21:35.20 --> 00:21:42.56
They're primarily talking about the MG 42 which is a big belt-fed machine gun. Very similar to

243
00:21:42.56 --> 00:21:48.64
a modern what we have M60 or Mark 48 machine gun. A big heavy belt-fed machine gun

244
00:21:49.92 --> 00:21:56.96
which lays down the insane amounts of suppressive fire. So here we go. They're getting hit from

245
00:21:56.96 --> 00:22:01.84
both flanks with these machine guns back to the book. There must have been about 12 machine guns

246
00:22:01.84 --> 00:22:09.36
firing at one time. This devastating display of firepower stopped the battalion dead in its tracks.

247
00:22:09.36 --> 00:22:16.80
There was no way forward or around it and no way to retire. Some of the guns had engaged D company

248
00:22:16.80 --> 00:22:23.52
over the heads of B company and private Morrison 18 platoon was killed. So there's his first guy,

249
00:22:23.52 --> 00:22:31.20
lost. I like this the way he starts off this next sentence here. First word,

250
00:22:31.20 --> 00:22:37.12
powerless. So he's in his first combat situation. He's got one man killed and how does he feel

251
00:22:37.12 --> 00:22:42.32
powerless. Here we go. Powerless and crouching in a headrow. I tried to identify the Spanned

252
00:22:42.32 --> 00:22:48.32
Alphazicians. This proved impossible as they still kept up their crushing display of firepower.

253
00:22:49.12 --> 00:22:53.44
In my ignorance I expected that the enemy machine gunners would soon expand their ammunition.

254
00:22:53.44 --> 00:23:03.68
They did not. Nor did they in dozens of subsequent battles. So he's waiting for them to stop shooting.

255
00:23:03.68 --> 00:23:10.56
They don't. They just keep coming. Captain Scamel commanding A company was severely wounded.

256
00:23:10.56 --> 00:23:15.68
Major Thomas commanding B company was killed. Their companies were badly cut up on our right

257
00:23:15.68 --> 00:23:21.12
the fifth wheelchairs had faired no better with their CO killed and casualties mounting.

258
00:23:21.12 --> 00:23:27.60
Their attack also foundered. As the afternoon turned to evening,

259
00:23:27.60 --> 00:23:32.000
shelling and mortoring increased much of it passing over our heads. Thus isolating us from the

260
00:23:32.64 --> 00:23:38.48
reserve battalion. So the Germans are mortoring over their heads so that the reserve battalion can't

261
00:23:38.48 --> 00:23:45.84
get to them. Shortly before dark, a troop of tanks arrived. One of which was able to cross the

262
00:23:45.84 --> 00:23:51.36
stream and give us some brave, close support. Undoubtedly it increased our morale but it was not enough

263
00:23:51.36 --> 00:23:58.88
to get the whole attack underway again. Any movement by B company to our front brought down instant

264
00:23:58.88 --> 00:24:06.32
and concentrated Spanned Alphazer. The same applied to us a few hundred yards to their rear.

265
00:24:07.04 --> 00:24:12.08
Fortunately the enemy did not seem to have any anti-tank guns so our armored friends

266
00:24:12.08 --> 00:24:19.12
were comparatively safe. But the fact remained that about 12 Spanned O's had halted a battalion

267
00:24:19.12 --> 00:24:26.88
attack without our locating even one of them. That's what suppressive fire does. That's what a

268
00:24:26.88 --> 00:24:32.40
big machine gun does. You got 12 big machine guns that's stopping 700 people from moving.

269
00:24:33.84 --> 00:24:38.000
That's called suppressive fire. That's why you don't when you heard Roger Hayden talk about

270
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.36
how many heavy weapons that how many machine guns they'd carry. They think they had nine

271
00:24:43.36 --> 00:24:52.32
out of opportunity to 14. That's why. As Dusk fell a new plan was made. C and D companies would

272
00:24:52.32 --> 00:24:57.52
advance and single file through A and B companies and using the cover of darkness infiltrate

273
00:24:57.52 --> 00:25:01.36
the enemy position. Once through them we would climb to the top of the hill and consolidate.

274
00:25:02.24 --> 00:25:07.68
A cold and damp mist descended which with fading light gave us welcome cover but also

275
00:25:07.68 --> 00:25:12.72
wretched discomfort. We were still in shirt sleeves which became damp from the sweat of our

276
00:25:12.72 --> 00:25:19.68
exertion climbing the steep lower slopes. A lurk with pistol in hand I anticipated a sudden brush

277
00:25:19.68 --> 00:25:26.80
with an enemy post. Not a shot was fired. By some miracle we passed right through their positions

278
00:25:26.80 --> 00:25:36.000
without being detected or luck had changed. So you're going to see quite a bit of that is as they

279
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.88
were what the Germans were doing at this point defending hard but then instead of staying and dying

280
00:25:40.88 --> 00:25:45.68
in most cases they would retreat. And so they'd fight really hard for a while and then retreat.

281
00:25:46.24 --> 00:25:49.28
They'd advance if they had an opportunity but you're going to see a lot of that.

282
00:25:50.32 --> 00:25:54.40
Back to the book we now had to advance across a large orchard. So I deployed the

283
00:25:54.40 --> 00:25:59.76
cartoon with two sections up and urged them forward as fast as possible. Suddenly in the middle of

284
00:25:59.76 --> 00:26:04.000
the orchard we came across a young girl in a clean white dress sitting with her back to an

285
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.84
apple tree sketching. Now I just talked about this the most of the random things that happen

286
00:26:11.84 --> 00:26:16.96
in combat and this is what I'm talking about and how do you train for that? How would you ever

287
00:26:16.96 --> 00:26:20.16
if you're running a battle problem to train people what are you going to do put a white girl

288
00:26:20.16 --> 00:26:24.32
in a white dress and then sitting with her back to a tree sketching? Doesn't make any sense?

289
00:26:24.32 --> 00:26:28.32
How do you deal with it? Back to the book she seemed quite oblivious to the mortar fire in 18

290
00:26:28.32 --> 00:26:33.20
boutunes warlike appearance. How to stop pretty young girls from interfering with battle

291
00:26:33.20 --> 00:26:38.40
had not been part of my training as an officer cadet nor had it appeared on the curriculum of

292
00:26:38.40 --> 00:26:44.80
any battle schools which without exception had dispared of my future as an infantry soldier.

293
00:26:46.24 --> 00:26:51.68
Fortunately there was a farmhouse beside the orchard and it had a seller where she was persuaded

294
00:26:51.68 --> 00:26:57.36
to shelter while we got on with our battle. I reported what it occurred to our company commander

295
00:26:57.36 --> 00:27:01.28
who told me that I was being quite ridiculous really Jerry you're being absurd.

296
00:27:01.28 --> 00:27:08.64
With that remark I realized that he had been a schoolmaster, a breed with whom I had been in conflict

297
00:27:10.08 --> 00:27:16.72
until quite recently. A breed with whom I'd been in conflict with until quite recently. So this guy

298
00:27:16.72 --> 00:27:23.84
has the attitude of a schoolmaster which in England is a little bit different and especially in the

299
00:27:23.84 --> 00:27:28.80
1930s and 40s you know the strict I think of a pink Floyd you know the headmaster

300
00:27:28.80 --> 00:27:33.68
how can you have it you putting if you don't eat you meet that guy that's what he's comparing them to.

301
00:27:34.56 --> 00:27:39.84
His next sarcastic remark I would be obliged Jerry if you would kindly get on with the war.

302
00:27:40.56 --> 00:27:43.76
He gave me little indication of what he wanted my opportunity to do,

303
00:27:43.76 --> 00:27:49.92
nor did it inspire confidence. We were still over 200 yards from the meadow surrounded by corn fields

304
00:27:49.92 --> 00:27:54.80
which was the company's objective and now became apparent that our company commander had an

305
00:27:54.80 --> 00:28:00.80
academic and detached attitude of mind which made it quite impossible for him to come in the company.

306
00:28:01.76 --> 00:28:06.08
So the company the company commander's not in the game. There's one thing to be detached from your

307
00:28:06.08 --> 00:28:10.80
emotions to make sure you're not getting caught up in the mayhem was another thing to be so detached

308
00:28:10.80 --> 00:28:16.48
that you're not even aware of what's going on and actually I had a name for this when I was running

309
00:28:16.48 --> 00:28:22.96
training. Battlefield aloofness is what I call them because we'd get these guys you get these

310
00:28:22.96 --> 00:28:27.52
guys and we'd be running these crazy battlefield problems on them and there'd be not to be crazy

311
00:28:27.52 --> 00:28:32.40
and you'd go remember one time there's the the task unit commander there's all this mayhem going on.

312
00:28:32.40 --> 00:28:36.000
The Patoons are getting overrun and people are getting me you know shot with paintball and they're

313
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.80
not hitting their objectives and I walk over to the company commander he's sitting in a home v

314
00:28:40.80 --> 00:28:44.32
I'm sorry the the to you commander the troop commander he's sitting in a home v

315
00:28:45.68 --> 00:28:49.76
and I like the windows up because they're both windows but he doesn't want to get shot with paintball

316
00:28:49.76 --> 00:28:54.48
the windows up he's just sitting in there he's got his head set on of his radio like knock on the door

317
00:28:54.48 --> 00:29:01.68
I'm like hey man you know what what's going on out there he's like well I'm I'm trying to gather that

318
00:29:01.68 --> 00:29:08.48
information right now and I'm like bro you eager to gather anything here but dust yeah you need to

319
00:29:08.48 --> 00:29:12.88
get out there and make something happen because his idea was you know I need to be detached

320
00:29:12.88 --> 00:29:17.12
which I talk about being detached all the time but there's a difference between being and as you

321
00:29:17.12 --> 00:29:22.16
see the same thing in businesses where the the the boss or the leader has no idea what's

322
00:29:22.16 --> 00:29:27.04
happening on the ground floor right he has no what the the workers are doing so he's so far to

323
00:29:27.04 --> 00:29:32.64
attach that he's he's you know let them eat cake right that's where that's where this guy is

324
00:29:32.64 --> 00:29:38.80
wait so why is that that's because what they they just in a way just depend on them to just handle it

325
00:29:38.80 --> 00:29:42.48
on their own they think they're gonna handle it on their own which is a good attitude to have until

326
00:29:42.48 --> 00:29:48.40
they can't handle it anymore right once they can't once a once a team or a platoon or a business

327
00:29:48.40 --> 00:29:54.08
you can't handle it on their own and they're failing you have to get you have to go do your

328
00:29:54.08 --> 00:29:58.48
job you have to step up you have to step down as leader you have to get in there and square that

329
00:29:58.48 --> 00:30:05.12
stuff away yeah so it's that without the get in their part right it's just like all right just

330
00:30:05.12 --> 00:30:10.32
call me when it's done yeah and and and the problem is somebody's got to sort these problems out

331
00:30:10.32 --> 00:30:15.60
yeah yeah they're there they're real and and they're not getting better and you might take you a

332
00:30:15.60 --> 00:30:19.04
minute's go okay wait a second this these problems aren't getting better what should I do

333
00:30:19.04 --> 00:30:22.24
once you realize that they're not getting better you got to get in there make it happen yeah

334
00:30:24.24 --> 00:30:29.60
this guy's not doing that back to the book he'd be behaved like a superseelious

335
00:30:29.60 --> 00:30:35.76
umpire on an exercise in England at any moment I expected him to had managed me for bad tactics

336
00:30:35.76 --> 00:30:43.12
and the schoolboy in me feared that I might be sent to the headmaster for beating so they continue on

337
00:30:43.12 --> 00:30:47.84
we seized the highest point which faced the enemy and the other platoons quickly deployed

338
00:30:47.84 --> 00:30:53.44
to give all around defense of the other flanks after being murdered the company required no

339
00:30:53.44 --> 00:31:01.92
encouragement to dig in the real motivator getting mortar will make you shovel hard yeah the company

340
00:31:01.92 --> 00:31:10.24
commander walked round the platoon positions I ain't everyone with distaste nothing pleased him

341
00:31:10.24 --> 00:31:15.52
and he suddenly announced that he must sleep which he did in my slit trench getting not a good

342
00:31:15.52 --> 00:31:21.92
feeling about this company commander just looking at everyone like negatively and then all of a

343
00:31:21.92 --> 00:31:27.92
sudden he wants to sleep I don't like this guy and of course he sleeps in in my trench

344
00:31:27.92 --> 00:31:34.64
mm now this is good there's another officer that's there that's present a guardian angel was

345
00:31:34.64 --> 00:31:41.52
watching over us in the guise of Dennis Clark Dennis some years older than me was exceptionally

346
00:31:41.52 --> 00:31:49.44
kind to me and tolerant of my immaturity pay attention this is good he took my took me by the arm a

347
00:31:49.44 --> 00:31:57.52
few paces away from my platoon who the hell is in command of this shambles sunny I muttered the

348
00:31:57.52 --> 00:32:03.68
unconvincing explanation that it was our company commander looking me straight in the eye he drew a

349
00:32:03.68 --> 00:32:09.60
deep breath which managed to express both exasperation at my explanation and sympathy with my

350
00:32:09.60 --> 00:32:19.44
predicament you and I know that he is not so what are you going to do about it I asked him if I

351
00:32:19.44 --> 00:32:28.32
should take command his expression hardened yes you bloody well should some demonstration of loyalty

352
00:32:28.32 --> 00:32:33.52
to my wretched company commander was obviously required I blurred it out that he was really a school master

353
00:32:33.52 --> 00:32:39.76
and not a professional soldier so he's kind of defending him Dennis put his arm around my shoulder

354
00:32:39.76 --> 00:32:51.36
and whispered in my ear so was eyes sunny so that's awesome the company commander is not leading

355
00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:00.08
and this this guy Dennis Clark quit think he's artillery gunner pulls this guy's head aside and

356
00:33:00.08 --> 00:33:05.60
just throw you better take charge of this and you better do it quick back to the book we were now

357
00:33:05.60 --> 00:33:11.92
well dug in on our objective the company commander was still asleep Dennis was arranging defensive

358
00:33:11.92 --> 00:33:19.84
fire tasks for me I had assumed command of D company without a word passing between our company

359
00:33:19.84 --> 00:33:26.000
commander and me in practice it made not the slightest difference because because like a bad

360
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:34.80
preparatory school master he saw his role as one of examination and criticism this he continued to

361
00:33:34.80 --> 00:33:40.88
do despite the incredulous stairs of the ncos so he's taken charge and and he hasn't even said anything

362
00:33:40.88 --> 00:33:45.76
he's just done it he just took charge and all the guys the guys continue to walk around did

363
00:33:45.76 --> 00:33:52.32
stare glare at everyone but that doesn't matter so this is a classic example your leader's not

364
00:33:52.32 --> 00:33:57.68
leading I've given this answer to so many times but this is a classic this might be one of the best

365
00:33:57.68 --> 00:34:05.12
examples your leaders not leading that's fine good step up and lead yourself hmm back to the book

366
00:34:05.12 --> 00:34:09.60
by dawn the enemy had retired an elements of the Italian move forward to consolidate and strength

367
00:34:09.60 --> 00:34:15.92
and decoupling his position the whole operation was very amateur there was no doubt that the new

368
00:34:15.92 --> 00:34:22.40
company commander could not command a company in battle nor could I who is just beginning to master

369
00:34:22.40 --> 00:34:28.24
the rudiments of commanding a platoon he was removed within a few hours I think Dennis had something to

370
00:34:28.24 --> 00:34:34.16
do with it but he was not the kind of man to confide in 20 year old sub-alterns so that's another

371
00:34:34.16 --> 00:34:41.60
classic thing right there is that this guy Dennis who is another officer probably went and said

372
00:34:41.60 --> 00:34:45.92
to get this guy out of here get this company commander out of here but when he does it the company

373
00:34:45.92 --> 00:34:51.28
commander gets removed and and he doesn't say anything to Sydney Jerry he doesn't you to

374
00:34:51.28 --> 00:34:56.72
rattle it out or brag about her make a big deal he doesn't say anything just happens it's like

375
00:34:56.72 --> 00:35:01.84
when I had a mutiny and my platoon and the commanding officer's like no we're not firing anyone you

376
00:35:01.84 --> 00:35:06.40
guys get out of here shut your mouth and go back to work no we're like okay and then a few days

377
00:35:06.40 --> 00:35:11.44
a little like a week later he got fired but he wasn't because of us as far as we knew right no one

378
00:35:11.44 --> 00:35:17.68
said anything we just knew he got fired yeah well what reason hmm we knew we had something to do with it

379
00:35:17.68 --> 00:35:25.68
but same thing so you don't need to create a distrust and disloyalty and and not even just those

380
00:35:25.68 --> 00:35:30.24
words but you don't need to create drama yeah right don't create the drama yeah that guy's

381
00:35:30.24 --> 00:35:34.40
going to go in somewhere he's getting building someone else hey you guys want everybody yeah yeah we're

382
00:35:34.40 --> 00:35:40.24
not doing that we're not doing that we're not building up our own ego by disparaging someone else's

383
00:35:40.24 --> 00:35:47.44
let's worry about the whole team that sounds like a good idea to me yeah back to the book I now have

384
00:35:47.44 --> 00:35:52.80
little doubt that for the first two months in Normandy we lack two things comprehensive and imaginative

385
00:35:52.80 --> 00:35:58.64
training and personal experience of battle we were also seriously handicapped by our casual

386
00:35:58.64 --> 00:36:05.12
attitude too many junior officers did not think for themselves and persistently relied on the

387
00:36:05.12 --> 00:36:11.76
narrow teaching of battle schools who's dogma had assumed the proportion of holy rit so whatever

388
00:36:11.76 --> 00:36:16.96
he was taught he was taught that that's the only way you can ever do it and these guys and if

389
00:36:16.96 --> 00:36:22.64
talk about this many times on the on the podcast the goal when I was running training was to actually

390
00:36:22.64 --> 00:36:27.36
get the people to think it wasn't get sure you have to establish the baseline standard operating

391
00:36:27.36 --> 00:36:33.68
procedures that's great and those need to be rock solid but once those things are established you

392
00:36:33.68 --> 00:36:39.76
need to make people understand that you don't always follow them and you need to call off a piece

393
00:36:39.76 --> 00:36:43.12
of that standard operating procedure to insert some other thing and bring in another standard

394
00:36:43.12 --> 00:36:46.56
operating procedure and mix and match them so you get something that's effective you need to

395
00:36:46.56 --> 00:36:51.92
think that's what a leader needs to do a leader needs to think back to the book the British

396
00:36:51.92 --> 00:36:56.64
infantry platoons and companies were overtrained and board stiff with basic infantry tactics

397
00:36:56.64 --> 00:37:00.80
which as far as they went were good much of this training unfortunately had been in the hands

398
00:37:00.80 --> 00:37:06.96
of battle school instructors who themselves lacked battle experience and imagination

399
00:37:08.40 --> 00:37:15.12
these tended to become pedagogues disciples of DS directing staff solution

400
00:37:15.12 --> 00:37:20.08
about which no argument could be tolerated so DS is that he be he mentions in a bunch

401
00:37:20.88 --> 00:37:24.64
like that's their solution the directing staff you can't argue with them they're the they're the

402
00:37:24.64 --> 00:37:33.04
cadre possibly like most of our entry infantry they suffered some consequences of the pre-roar

403
00:37:33.04 --> 00:37:39.68
shortage of creativity intelligent regimental officers two few of them were professionally

404
00:37:39.68 --> 00:37:44.56
dedicated to the extent that they could visualize how battles would be fought and identify the

405
00:37:44.56 --> 00:37:50.08
problems that might arise when planning them they seemed to lack the capacity to think relentlessly

406
00:37:50.08 --> 00:37:56.80
through these things until solutions were found much of their time had been spent policing the British

407
00:37:56.80 --> 00:38:03.76
empire also unlike the Germans we British instinctively avoid displays of keenness

408
00:38:04.72 --> 00:38:08.96
the enthusiast particularly if he is innovative isn't embarrassment

409
00:38:08.96 --> 00:38:18.32
thus the battlefield became our teacher and inevitably it exacted a grim price in blood and time

410
00:38:20.32 --> 00:38:28.40
so as you're training you got to push yourself hard you've got to put yourself in situations

411
00:38:28.40 --> 00:38:31.52
I don't care what you're training for I don't care if you're training for combat in a

412
00:38:31.52 --> 00:38:38.88
sea of platoon in an army infantry platoon or if you're in the business world and you're training your leaders to handle

413
00:38:38.88 --> 00:38:44.32
situations or you're training your customer service reps to handle situations what no matter which one of

414
00:38:44.32 --> 00:38:48.56
those you're in you need to push people hard you need to put them in worst case scenario so that they

415
00:38:48.56 --> 00:38:52.16
need to learn how they need to learn how to think to get out of those problems

416
00:38:52.16 --> 00:39:02.32
hmm I recall within bearishment an incident at 45th Infantry Division battle school during the

417
00:39:02.32 --> 00:39:08.48
spring of 1944 an exceptionally tall and good-natured Canadian officer had been sent to the school to

418
00:39:08.48 --> 00:39:14.16
give a talk on the street fighting he had experienced nearly it was an interesting talk but some of

419
00:39:14.16 --> 00:39:21.12
his advice ran contrary to that being taught in the school when the lecture was over the chief and

420
00:39:21.12 --> 00:39:28.96
instructor with insulting condensation thank this shy and kindly man for a vivid word picture

421
00:39:28.96 --> 00:39:36.24
and turning to the students warned us that as this officer's experience was probably unusual

422
00:39:36.24 --> 00:39:45.68
we had best not stray from the DS solution as taught at that school so you got to combat veteran

423
00:39:45.68 --> 00:39:52.72
come and back with experience from street fighting in Italy and he'd come back with some different tactics

424
00:39:53.84 --> 00:40:01.36
and they tell him you don't listen that guy that's just a rare case close mind will get you killed

425
00:40:04.88 --> 00:40:12.000
this is starting to talk about they're overall sort of formulation of combat plans and how they

426
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.40
operated back to the book the most successful actions by 18 Paltoon were fought without the support of

427
00:40:18.40 --> 00:40:26.72
artillery or armor we had learned in a hard school how to skirmish infiltrate and edge our way forward

428
00:40:27.44 --> 00:40:33.52
the right or left flanking platoon attack so beloved of the battle school staff would rarely succeed in

429
00:40:33.52 --> 00:40:41.04
the Normandy Bocage I remember with harbing locked into timetables of meticulously planned

430
00:40:41.04 --> 00:40:46.96
large battles these invariably left the junior infantry commander no scope for exploitation

431
00:40:47.60 --> 00:40:53.52
if you found a gap in the enemy defenses adherence to artillery program which rarely could be altered

432
00:40:53.52 --> 00:40:59.36
effectively stopped any personal initiative so what that saying is you have these the artillery

433
00:40:59.36 --> 00:41:04.56
that's gonna drop bombs they're gonna bomb or strike with artillery at certain regions in certain

434
00:41:04.56 --> 00:41:10.40
times so you might see the enemy running away and you have a chance to gain a superior tactical position

435
00:41:10.40 --> 00:41:14.24
but you can't because you know that that's where the bombs are going to be hitting in the next 12

436
00:41:14.24 --> 00:41:21.04
minutes so you can't go so now you sit and wait so he got locked in by that back to the book to me

437
00:41:21.04 --> 00:41:25.28
the preparations for these battles assumed the demented proportion of a cough got like

438
00:41:25.28 --> 00:41:33.20
nightmare ballet in which the anonymous they ordained that we must perform a choreographed ritual

439
00:41:33.20 --> 00:41:42.08
dance macabre I felt trapped and helpless no solo parts were written into the score nor was

440
00:41:42.08 --> 00:41:50.08
their scope for small groups of performers in this mammoth ballet of machines undoubtedly far shadows

441
00:41:50.08 --> 00:41:56.72
from the song that the battle song clouded my emotions but instinct told me that this kind of show

442
00:41:56.72 --> 00:42:02.72
would be unlikely to succeed the irony was that this support was planned and given to the infantry

443
00:42:02.72 --> 00:42:09.12
with the best of intentions the song had cast its shadows on our artillery and armored commanders

444
00:42:09.12 --> 00:42:17.44
both genuinely believed that their hands that in their hands they had the pancia which would protect

445
00:42:17.44 --> 00:42:25.04
us the infantry from the terrible slaughter of 1916 instead they put us in a straight jacket so

446
00:42:25.04 --> 00:42:33.12
very interesting viewpoint and and it's something that we need to pay attention to because you've got

447
00:42:33.12 --> 00:42:38.72
to be flexible you've got to be flexible and that's exactly what he's talking about and these they

448
00:42:38.72 --> 00:42:42.96
would make these plans that were so comprehensive and there was no you weren't allowed to deviate

449
00:42:42.96 --> 00:42:46.64
from the plants and you're not allowed to deviate from the plans and something starts going

450
00:42:46.64 --> 00:42:55.76
differently than what you expected you're trapped yeah to a phone back to the book far too much time

451
00:42:55.76 --> 00:43:02.16
had been spent fitting the infantry and armor junior leaders into the big picture and to little

452
00:43:02.16 --> 00:43:10.64
time spent training them and stimulating their imagination initiative an individual resourcefulness

453
00:43:10.64 --> 00:43:17.60
to probe draw conclusions infiltrate and exploit weakness in the enemy's dispositions so he's

454
00:43:17.60 --> 00:43:22.56
he's criticizing this lack of initiative lack of creativity and the training to get that initiative

455
00:43:22.56 --> 00:43:29.76
in creativity back to the book after the first of August 18 puttune never failed in any attack

456
00:43:31.04 --> 00:43:34.56
sometimes we took a little longer than planned but we always got there in the end

457
00:43:34.56 --> 00:43:43.04
in defense we never lost one yard of ground nor did the enemy ever penetrate arpotune position

458
00:43:43.04 --> 00:43:49.44
and we always dominated no man's land with our patrols whether persistent patrolling is always

459
00:43:49.44 --> 00:43:57.44
sound policy I will argue elsewhere so he's saying once he kind of figured it out they didn't

460
00:43:57.44 --> 00:44:01.36
lose anymore they didn't lose any attacks and they didn't give up any ground talks about the

461
00:44:01.36 --> 00:44:07.52
armor our armor was accused of being tiger shy meaning scared of the tiger tanks of the Germans

462
00:44:07.52 --> 00:44:15.04
and I don't wonder why the devastation caused by a single hit of an 88 millimeter armor piercing

463
00:44:15.04 --> 00:44:23.12
shell needed to be seen to be believed and this is an overall statement for the infantry and

464
00:44:23.12 --> 00:44:28.72
armor the British second army the sheer ferocity of the fighting in Normandy came as a

465
00:44:28.72 --> 00:44:37.04
salature solitary shock for which they were in some ways unprepared so it was devastating for

466
00:44:37.04 --> 00:44:46.48
these guys now we start pushing out out of out of Normandy and pushing into the scene

467
00:44:48.64 --> 00:44:54.80
and here we go they're pushing in the next day 28 August D company occupied a harricort

468
00:44:54.80 --> 00:45:01.60
this is the only operation of war that I ever known to go precisely as planned our supporting

469
00:45:01.60 --> 00:45:06.16
field regimen softened up the objective with their 25 pounders the company advanced over

470
00:45:06.16 --> 00:45:13.12
open farmland in a macular formation and consolidated exactly on time the only thing lacking

471
00:45:13.68 --> 00:45:23.04
was an enemy total bag one day's German one dead German and one dead hair rabbit

472
00:45:23.04 --> 00:45:28.24
right so the only one that everyone well was when there was no enemy to fight against there was

473
00:45:28.24 --> 00:45:34.56
there was two Germans one of them was dead the other one was dazed and that was their their last battle

474
00:45:35.36 --> 00:45:36.24
in France

475
00:45:39.28 --> 00:45:42.32
back to the book experience and Normandy had removed

476
00:45:43.52 --> 00:45:48.000
anxieties regarding commanding and under strength put to and so he hasn't had enough man he's supposed

477
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.44
to have 36 he's had like 17 18 19 in the attack particularly at night up till two

478
00:45:53.44 --> 00:45:55.84
nip full strength is just too big to maneuver quickly

479
00:45:57.20 --> 00:46:03.36
three rifle sections of about 20 above about seven man each plus headquarters was ideal

480
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.12
in defense it was a different matter the more riflemen on the ground the better

481
00:46:08.32 --> 00:46:15.20
our short stay in the men's ale millon gave me time to think

482
00:46:15.20 --> 00:46:21.92
the first opportunity to do so since i took command of 18 puttune it also gave me time to

483
00:46:21.92 --> 00:46:27.76
meet and talk with other young officers in the battalion it was then that I realized that 18

484
00:46:27.76 --> 00:46:36.40
puttune was no ordinary puttune it had some undefineable magic no quarrels little swearing

485
00:46:36.40 --> 00:46:40.80
despite the war that was the despite the war there was something peaceful about it

486
00:46:40.80 --> 00:46:48.72
a helping hand was always available for anybody the emotional links were firm and true

487
00:46:50.72 --> 00:46:56.08
I was a happy man so he realizes once he starts talking the other puttune commanders

488
00:46:56.08 --> 00:47:01.68
he's got this really special puttune that gets along great and he's he realizes it

489
00:47:03.12 --> 00:47:06.80
back to the book no young officer can command a puttune in battle on his own

490
00:47:06.80 --> 00:47:14.16
in Normandy I'd seen puttune commander served by poor nco struggling to gain some semblance of

491
00:47:14.16 --> 00:47:22.64
control over their but wielded and frightened men I'd also seen puttunes with good nco's go to pieces

492
00:47:22.64 --> 00:47:31.60
in the hands of an indifference officer Jim Kingston Doug Proctor and Owen cheeseman set the standard

493
00:47:31.60 --> 00:47:39.36
n-tone for 18 puttune without them I as the puttune commander would have joined the ranks of so many

494
00:47:39.36 --> 00:47:56.000
poor young officers who never achieved grip now going to another we're putting together another plan

495
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:02.24
as they're advancing and obviously this is a long book I'm doing an abridge version hitting

496
00:48:02.24 --> 00:48:09.44
some highlights you should get the book obviously get the book by the book back to the book

497
00:48:09.92 --> 00:48:15.44
at zero four hundred hours on twenty-fourth of September Douglass this is the new company commander

498
00:48:15.44 --> 00:48:22.64
Douglass held along oh group by candlelight in the seller of the farmhouse at which much to

499
00:48:22.64 --> 00:48:28.88
his annoyance I kept falling asleep we were ordered to advance straight eastward down a narrow

500
00:48:28.88 --> 00:48:36.32
country lane from the orchard to the main road and consolidate after the oh group and oh group is

501
00:48:36.32 --> 00:48:41.28
what they call the when their officers get together and pass the word knick called oh group after the

502
00:48:41.28 --> 00:48:46.000
oh group I made myself unpopular by asking why we're advancing towards an area of considerable

503
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:53.76
German opposition when my patrol found a better route by which we might outflank the enemy so

504
00:48:53.76 --> 00:48:58.40
that so he's saying hey wait what because his patrol his puttune had been out on a patrol and found

505
00:48:58.40 --> 00:49:05.44
a better route and he's asking why and he kind of gets shut down I was just twenty years old at the

506
00:49:05.44 --> 00:49:12.88
time and even then I knew I was incapable of disputing orders without giving a fence we started at

507
00:49:12.88 --> 00:49:17.76
zero six hundred hours two platoons leading on either side of the track the third falling in

508
00:49:17.76 --> 00:49:22.96
single filed down the track itself on either side were the small holdings were small holdings

509
00:49:22.96 --> 00:49:30.16
a few allotments in bungalows surrounded by small picket fences but platoons advanced through the

510
00:49:30.16 --> 00:49:35.52
gardens and vegetable patches and passed on either side of the bungalows the rear section

511
00:49:35.52 --> 00:49:40.72
searching each one quickly and while they're searching these little bungalows as their

512
00:49:40.72 --> 00:49:46.48
own patrol they find this back to the book during one of these hurried searches one section found

513
00:49:46.48 --> 00:49:54.56
a Dutch family the widdages father mother son and daughter riddled by schmites or fire

514
00:49:55.20 --> 00:50:01.76
that's a German machine gun they lay in awkward postures of death amid their ransacked home

515
00:50:01.76 --> 00:50:11.12
a visit from the SS no tears came nor did they come a half an hour later when we came upon

516
00:50:11.12 --> 00:50:17.44
the charred wreckage of an american decoda it had carried US parachute troops the 82nd airborne

517
00:50:17.44 --> 00:50:23.60
division and their torn and burnt bodies littered the orchard like charred and mutilated rag dolls

518
00:50:23.60 --> 00:50:32.000
it was a further iron or irony attached to the front window in what remained of the decoda's

519
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:40.64
cockpit was a tiny teddy bear untouched by flames two months before a lonely teddy bear and an

520
00:50:40.64 --> 00:50:48.32
impersonal pool of blood had brought forth tears now I was collected and objective when faced

521
00:50:48.32 --> 00:50:55.44
within the span of thirty minutes within a trotious murder and mass carnage by fire and he's

522
00:50:55.44 --> 00:51:02.48
referring there in the beginning of the book one of his first experiences he's by a slit trench

523
00:51:02.48 --> 00:51:10.24
and there's a dead guy soldier in it and there's a little teddy bear and and for some reason

524
00:51:10.24 --> 00:51:15.04
you know he's young he's in experience and it gets gets makes him super emotionally starts crying

525
00:51:15.04 --> 00:51:21.68
and and now he's a little further in the war he sees you know this horrible murdered family and these

526
00:51:23.04 --> 00:51:30.64
tragically you know burned and killed paratroopers and he's able to detach emotionally from it

527
00:51:34.16 --> 00:51:39.92
back to the book the enemy decided to make life unpleasant for us as possible by sudden unpredictable

528
00:51:39.92 --> 00:51:46.56
concentrations of heavy artillery right in the middle of our company area we called them stunks

529
00:51:46.56 --> 00:51:51.44
so he's gonna use that word it just means we're getting bombed one of these shells unfortunately

530
00:51:51.44 --> 00:51:59.60
fell right into one of sixteen platoon slit trenches no trace remained of the two men that were

531
00:51:59.60 --> 00:52:07.28
manning in it manning a brain in my platoon landscorpo jack Lee and private Peter Filmer

532
00:52:07.28 --> 00:52:13.28
were buried in the trench they shared other members of their section quickly dug them out unharmed

533
00:52:13.28 --> 00:52:21.84
very dirty and remarkably cheerful the self-propelled guns increased their activities

534
00:52:21.84 --> 00:52:28.08
filling the sky above the company with ugly black air bursts they could place these with

535
00:52:28.08 --> 00:52:33.84
uncanny accuracy to burst about twenty five feet above the road junction outside company headquarters

536
00:52:33.84 --> 00:52:42.24
the casualties mounted company sergeant major Sammy Jones and spot Martin the Jeepburg driver

537
00:52:42.24 --> 00:52:49.76
were both hit outside company HQ it was Sammy Jones who committed the battalion's only atrocity

538
00:52:51.28 --> 00:52:57.92
late one summer evening as the shadows from high trees and hedges fell across a small field

539
00:52:57.92 --> 00:53:05.04
the Normandy we took some young waffles and saw waffles and SS soldiers prisoner one of them a short

540
00:53:05.04 --> 00:53:13.12
stocky and fair youth of about eighteen proved insultingly truck-yland season the young

541
00:53:13.12 --> 00:53:19.12
loud by the scruff of his neck Sammy roared you can take that glint out of your eyes my boy

542
00:53:19.12 --> 00:53:28.40
and putting the wretched youth across his knees he gave his backside a sound whacking that is

543
00:53:28.40 --> 00:53:36.000
legit and that's again you know Sydney Jerry and he talks about how proud he is that his men

544
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:46.40
his men's behavior is so upstanding throughout this whole miserable experience and even when they

545
00:53:46.40 --> 00:53:54.16
see atrocities committed like by the SS they still maintain their discipline and their character

546
00:53:54.16 --> 00:54:00.96
and this is this is what he does oh you you're a little punk kid I'm gonna spank you

547
00:54:02.80 --> 00:54:11.92
you know tough the SS soldier getting put over the knee and spanked so after the attack so now

548
00:54:11.92 --> 00:54:18.88
this is again this is happening after one of these attacks and the whole the whole basic premise of

549
00:54:18.88 --> 00:54:26.40
this book is attack rest attack rest attack rest so as I'm reading I'm kind of picking out some of

550
00:54:26.40 --> 00:54:29.92
the attacks that they're going on and they're just moving through France and then through Germany that's

551
00:54:29.92 --> 00:54:34.24
what it is I should've explained that earlier but this is after one of the attacks

552
00:54:35.60 --> 00:54:40.40
it's interesting he says this smiling faces vanished and the gray look returned once more

553
00:54:40.40 --> 00:54:46.72
men walked with one air cocked in the air for approaching shells and with a slight stoop

554
00:54:47.76 --> 00:54:52.48
if you remember when I was talking about JP I was talking about how like you'd see guys they have

555
00:54:52.48 --> 00:54:59.60
this magical little stoop yeah that's what he's talking about and JP didn't have that no stoop

556
00:55:00.56 --> 00:55:05.84
JP who stand up like you stoop left he was not yeah he was stoopless he was standing up ready to get

557
00:55:05.84 --> 00:55:13.68
some but these guys as and it's contrast because when they're on the attack they go into like JP mode

558
00:55:13.68 --> 00:55:17.28
they're standing up straight they're ready to get some but then once they're on the defense and

559
00:55:17.28 --> 00:55:22.88
they're just waiting to get shell they start to stoop they start to crouch a little bit he continues

560
00:55:22.88 --> 00:55:27.20
back to the book the jokes began to peed around and the cheerful good morning surf ceased

561
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.40
when I went around the platoons at stand two morale was always higher during an attack

562
00:55:34.40 --> 00:55:42.96
sitting around and being sheldt is not an occupation to be recommended so there's a good lesson there

563
00:55:43.68 --> 00:55:49.12
if you or your team is being defensive about things your morale is going to go down because you're

564
00:55:49.12 --> 00:55:55.92
waiting to get hit so go on hit somebody you know go on the attack don't wait around don't let your

565
00:55:55.92 --> 00:56:08.72
morale drown here's another attack back to the book scrambling out of the culvert we set a fast

566
00:56:08.72 --> 00:56:15.12
pace up the side of the road to a company's positions this immediately brought small arms fire down

567
00:56:15.12 --> 00:56:21.44
on us but by then we were then 200 yards of their slit trenches so on we ran as fast as we could

568
00:56:21.44 --> 00:56:28.80
being soaked I began to steam my boots squelched and seemed to drag me back clawing at my feet as

569
00:56:28.80 --> 00:56:32.88
in a bad dream and stopping me from reaching the inviting cover of the slit trenches

570
00:56:33.76 --> 00:56:38.24
a company was dug in with two platoons forward in an orchard face to face to the enemy

571
00:56:38.24 --> 00:56:44.08
who were in dikes only a few yards beyond the third platoon was to the right rear protecting the

572
00:56:44.08 --> 00:56:52.72
open flank and company headquarters to the left rear centered on some farm buildings it was to these

573
00:56:52.72 --> 00:57:00.80
farm buildings that we ran hurling ourselves onto the straw on the barn floor we lay panting

574
00:57:00.80 --> 00:57:07.84
and gasping for breath john a cock a company commander appeared round the door of the barn

575
00:57:07.84 --> 00:57:16.24
he looked haggard and warned I doubt he had slept for a week the whole company area was covered

576
00:57:16.24 --> 00:57:22.24
by the most intense spandell fire and defensive and the defensive battle here was one of fire

577
00:57:22.24 --> 00:57:29.84
supremacy which the Germans had undoubtedly won a company's morale was low they had just lost

578
00:57:29.84 --> 00:57:36.000
hairy barns one of the platoon commanders who refusing to take cover strutted about an usual manner

579
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.88
he took a complete burst of spandell fire under the arm

580
00:57:40.88 --> 00:57:46.40
hairy was an amazing and fearless fellow who didn't care a damn for anything

581
00:57:47.44 --> 00:57:51.20
even after the burst hit him he still lived for about three hours

582
00:57:53.52 --> 00:57:59.92
the men respected hairy and with their idle shot down in front of them they were very jumpy

583
00:57:59.92 --> 00:58:08.48
another time you have to watch out for morale obviously

584
00:58:11.12 --> 00:58:17.36
now if you remember this book started in the summer time and now we're starting to get

585
00:58:19.20 --> 00:58:24.16
towards fall and this this is something I never thought about before

586
00:58:24.16 --> 00:58:30.80
when fall comes you know the sun is up for a shorter period of time

587
00:58:30.80 --> 00:58:35.28
so here we go back to the book the nights became longer and the dawns gray and chilly

588
00:58:35.84 --> 00:58:40.64
the sun sets were red and vivid and the days though beautiful short and rapidly

589
00:58:41.36 --> 00:58:46.88
as the nights lengthened the hours of staggered lengthened and with them the mental and physical

590
00:58:46.88 --> 00:58:54.96
fatigue of the company so they have to stay up you know rotate through watches at night

591
00:58:54.96 --> 00:58:59.12
you just don't get to sleep the whole time so if it's if it's dark for longer you got to stay

592
00:58:59.12 --> 00:59:04.88
wake longer at night so it's starting to wear on the company itself

593
00:59:06.48 --> 00:59:11.92
back to the book there was there is one incident small room when remembered by itself

594
00:59:11.92 --> 00:59:19.92
in a life of such incidents but very but to me very vivid in my platoon there was a young lad aged

595
00:59:19.92 --> 00:59:30.56
18 named Biddle he was of slight of build fair and looked a mere child he had a pleasant personality

596
00:59:30.56 --> 00:59:37.92
and was liked by everyone he had joined the company at La Mensell Millan after we had cross the

597
00:59:37.92 --> 00:59:47.28
CN at Vernon in August one morning there was a crack in a short interval of silence

598
00:59:49.52 --> 00:59:54.24
soon the shout went out stretcher bearers echoed through the orchard

599
00:59:55.84 --> 01:00:00.56
I ran towards the commotion and saw Biddle writhing in agony on the ground

600
01:00:00.56 --> 01:00:09.60
at first he looked on hurt but as I tore open his tunic I saw clear wound through his abdomen

601
01:00:09.60 --> 01:00:18.08
coming out by a spine he soon became numb and was no longer in pain but was very frightened and

602
01:00:18.08 --> 01:00:26.000
shivered we dragged him back behind the house and applied field dressings to his stomach and his

603
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:34.96
back in case the wound started to bleed his young life solely ebbbing from his body our stretcher bearers

604
01:00:35.76 --> 01:00:44.80
quietly and reverently carried him away the scene is now too poignant to remember without shedding

605
01:00:44.80 --> 01:00:51.60
a tear after Biddle had been evacuated the morale of the platoon dropped

606
01:00:51.60 --> 01:00:58.88
he had been hit while standing in his slit trench by a sniper at least 300 yards away

607
01:01:04.48 --> 01:01:11.36
and you know it's it's interesting and I didn't go into this part but there's a part earlier in the book where

608
01:01:13.04 --> 01:01:15.44
he he basically

609
01:01:15.44 --> 01:01:28.08
disparages some what the use of snipers and he talks about how they usually don't gain you anything

610
01:01:29.52 --> 01:01:34.88
tactically but it's interesting what it does to the morale of a platoon isn't it

611
01:01:37.60 --> 01:01:41.36
and he you know he doesn't completely know he he explains that there's uses and there's

612
01:01:41.36 --> 01:01:48.96
believe me there's probably no bigger believer in the use of snipers in the world than me but

613
01:01:48.96 --> 01:01:55.76
it's interesting yeah he he basically you can tell he's a very a guy with you know this extremely high

614
01:01:55.76 --> 01:02:02.48
moral character and he kind of gets the feeling when he explains it that you know he didn't feel

615
01:02:02.48 --> 01:02:07.76
comfortable with sniping because people aren't expecting it there's not a battle happening he felt like

616
01:02:07.76 --> 01:02:14.80
it was a cheap shot but it's interesting the effect that it actually has on his platoon

617
01:02:18.40 --> 01:02:25.36
in this moment here we're gonna get to a point he's got Germans are in a diek they're just a

618
01:02:25.36 --> 01:02:31.76
head of 18 18 platoon and 18 platoon is kind of pinned down and remember this character from

619
01:02:31.76 --> 01:02:36.48
earlier Dennis Clark Dennis Clark was the was the guy that pulled him aside and said hey you need to take

620
01:02:36.48 --> 01:02:41.04
man to his company well like I said Dennis Clark or I I thought I'd remember and I was right Dennis Clark

621
01:02:41.04 --> 01:02:48.08
was a was an artillery guy that called an artillery so here we go back to the book I was saved by

622
01:02:48.08 --> 01:02:57.04
Captain Dennis Clark MC our team gunner Dennis had a virtue also touch where 25 founders were concerned

623
01:02:58.64 --> 01:03:03.68
sniping with one gun that should get the buggers out he said with total confidence

624
01:03:03.68 --> 01:03:11.12
moving his 19 set into my that's a radio moving his 19 set into my platoon position no easy task in

625
01:03:11.12 --> 01:03:16.64
daylight he gave us a display of the most brilliant professionalism we had come to expect from the

626
01:03:16.64 --> 01:03:24.40
94th field regiment by firing with only one gun and making his mean point of impact beyond the diek

627
01:03:24.40 --> 01:03:32.000
containing the Germans he slowly decreased the range yard by yard until one shell exploded in the diek

628
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:41.92
out came five very wet and shaken pans or grandadiers during this episode all the platoon had to remain

629
01:03:43.12 --> 01:03:48.40
in the bottom of their slith trenches because Dennis' shells came over our positions with minimum

630
01:03:48.40 --> 01:03:54.16
clearance I doubt if any experienced infantry officer would deny that the Royal Artillery

631
01:03:54.16 --> 01:03:59.52
during the second World War were the most professionally competent people in the British Army

632
01:03:59.52 --> 01:04:07.68
so again an interesting dichotomy because in the beginning he talks about how the artillery

633
01:04:07.68 --> 01:04:13.28
can track them because it's being used in this broad plan that's locking in with there's no deviation

634
01:04:13.28 --> 01:04:18.88
but here he's talking about how brilliant it is because he's directly coordinating with it he's

635
01:04:18.88 --> 01:04:24.16
explaining to the artillery officer where to put those rounds what the problem is and then letting

636
01:04:24.16 --> 01:04:29.84
the artillery officer solve it so there's a dichotomy there just like there's a dichotomy with the snipers

637
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.56
back to the book after a few more days in the orchard we were becoming increasingly exhausted and

638
01:04:38.56 --> 01:04:44.08
our fighting efficiency deteriorated this condition existed not only in my company but throughout

639
01:04:44.08 --> 01:04:50.72
the battalion consequently the news of a move back to rest came as a colossal relief to us all

640
01:04:50.72 --> 01:04:56.80
but we did not know who is going to take over our positions the take over was to be at night

641
01:04:57.76 --> 01:05:02.48
and was to be carried out as quickly as possible if the enemy discovered it a determined attack could

642
01:05:02.48 --> 01:05:08.64
cause endless confusion and slaughter during the late afternoon of one particularly unpleasant day

643
01:05:08.64 --> 01:05:12.64
Douglas appeared that's a company commander appeared within American captain in two

644
01:05:12.64 --> 01:05:18.48
lieutenant's from a parachute battalion of the hundred and first airborne division they patied

645
01:05:18.48 --> 01:05:24.40
around the company area in their rubber-sold boots with the eyes of the whole company following them

646
01:05:24.40 --> 01:05:29.68
it's a hundred and first is coming into a leave him having reckoned ordered our area the

647
01:05:29.68 --> 01:05:34.000
Americans returned to the company HQ to discuss administrative points for the takeover

648
01:05:34.72 --> 01:05:38.48
the plan was for the American company commander to bring his company down the main road in

649
01:05:38.48 --> 01:05:43.44
single file along the edge of the ditch when the head of the column reach our company HQ they would

650
01:05:43.44 --> 01:05:47.84
be met by guides from each of our platoons to lead the American platoons to their positions

651
01:05:47.84 --> 01:05:51.76
as soon as they were on the ground our platoons were withdraw and assemble on the road

652
01:05:52.80 --> 01:06:00.48
this may sound simple in practice at but at night in close contact with the enemy it certainly was not

653
01:06:01.20 --> 01:06:05.60
this type of operation leaves two companies particularly vulnerable during the handover

654
01:06:06.16 --> 01:06:09.84
a determined enemy could attack and turn the operation into a massacre

655
01:06:10.56 --> 01:06:15.52
this is one of and I've said this before on the podcast one of the hardest things to do is

656
01:06:15.52 --> 01:06:21.36
link up with friendly forces on the battlefield and if you're under fire it's it's even harder

657
01:06:22.16 --> 01:06:26.16
so this one they're trying to do it not under fire trying to sneak and make it happen

658
01:06:28.32 --> 01:06:32.08
back to the book the rest of the day was spent packing making sure the enemy noticed nothing of

659
01:06:32.08 --> 01:06:38.08
this antit activity we put our spare ammunition onto the carriers with great coats and blankets

660
01:06:38.08 --> 01:06:43.04
the whole afternoon was strangely quiet there was no activity from the enemy and we in turn kept quiet

661
01:06:43.04 --> 01:06:49.28
the sun went down a mid-a-firey sky looking east the sky was threateningly gray

662
01:06:50.80 --> 01:06:56.40
I went around I went around my position to with Sergeant Kingston before the Americans arrived

663
01:06:57.36 --> 01:07:02.08
all my men looked tired and could hardly muster a smile as I went from slit to slit

664
01:07:03.20 --> 01:07:07.20
many had contained two men and now contained only one

665
01:07:07.20 --> 01:07:15.12
together with some momento of his former mate a mess tin or a bloodstained jacket even a

666
01:07:15.12 --> 01:07:25.12
packet of cigarettes wet and limp with dew I wondered how many more momentos would be there

667
01:07:25.12 --> 01:07:33.36
when the Americans were relieved about an hour later the Americans arrived they loomed up in the

668
01:07:33.36 --> 01:07:37.84
darkness by the roadside padding along in the rubber sold boots without a whisper

669
01:07:39.04 --> 01:07:43.84
I fought at the time what splendid troops they were and how excellent their equipment

670
01:07:45.04 --> 01:07:50.08
I was particularly impressed by the silent and quick way they were led by their squad commanders

671
01:07:50.72 --> 01:07:54.000
to our section positions so

672
01:07:55.52 --> 01:07:59.68
there come the Americans who leave them the hundred first airborne division

673
01:07:59.68 --> 01:08:05.60
who's just outstanding soldiers they're just awesome and we worked with them

674
01:08:05.60 --> 01:08:11.04
I mean one of my platoon in Ramadi work with the live with them the first the 506

675
01:08:11.68 --> 01:08:18.48
the band of brothers and you can tell they're the reputation that the guys in Ramadi

676
01:08:18.48 --> 01:08:25.76
upheld that standard in every possible way but it's rooted all the way back to the soldiers right here

677
01:08:25.76 --> 01:08:31.76
sounds like this is what struck me when I read that I was like this this that that tradition of

678
01:08:31.76 --> 01:08:38.80
excellence in that unit has gone from world war to from these guys right here and it's that same

679
01:08:38.80 --> 01:08:41.60
attitude that I saw with guys in Ramadi the same attitude

680
01:08:45.84 --> 01:08:53.68
alright now he makes a statement here about this whole big operation which was called market garden

681
01:08:53.68 --> 01:08:59.52
which was this giant operation to try and caught off the Germans sees multiple bridges and

682
01:08:59.52 --> 01:09:06.000
there's three bridges they were trying to seize and it it didn't reach its full effect it wasn't

683
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.12
like a complete mission success they didn't achieve every objective that they wanted to

684
01:09:12.96 --> 01:09:18.08
so here we go back to the book market garden was a sad operation complete success coming so close

685
01:09:18.08 --> 01:09:27.44
at a stroke the war in Europe could have been finished in 1944 undoubtedly mistakes were made

686
01:09:27.44 --> 01:09:33.28
both by the first airborne division particularly their planners and also by 30 core and there was

687
01:09:33.28 --> 01:09:40.48
no shortage of bad luck however in my experiences in my experience most battles are riddled with

688
01:09:40.48 --> 01:09:47.84
misfortunes and mistakes and the of the sort found in this operation it was not a failure because

689
01:09:47.84 --> 01:09:54.48
the ground was taken and a prerequisite to both operation veritable and the rind crossing so wasn't

690
01:09:54.48 --> 01:10:00.88
like a total failure back to the book I'm convinced that had the supreme commander generalize

691
01:10:00.88 --> 01:10:07.52
now are given market garden the unqualified support that it justified it would have totally succeeded

692
01:10:07.52 --> 01:10:13.76
despite its crop of tack coerres and planning and execution I suppose it was just one more

693
01:10:13.76 --> 01:10:21.28
casualty of the american mania for dispersal of effort however it was without a doubt the most

694
01:10:21.28 --> 01:10:26.56
exciting and imaginatively planned battle in which 18 puttune ever fought and I'm proud we've

695
01:10:26.56 --> 01:10:31.68
taken part so he's talking about the folks of effort he's talking about you if you spread yourself

696
01:10:31.68 --> 01:10:35.28
out to thin you're not gonna you're not gonna make it happen we call that prioritize next hit

697
01:10:35.28 --> 01:10:42.64
what's the biggest priority let's put our resources there they didn't do that and therefore didn't

698
01:10:42.64 --> 01:10:48.64
get a full mission success now of course what resources were there what was available there's

699
01:10:48.64 --> 01:10:55.44
no one has unlimited resources no one if you have that you have no issues right you just crush

700
01:10:55.44 --> 01:11:05.28
problems with manpower all right so now they're moving beyond market garden and planning

701
01:11:05.28 --> 01:11:12.96
actually planning he's planning a patrol through a village back to the bup battle school teaching

702
01:11:12.96 --> 01:11:18.80
at the time prescribed a strength of 12 to 20 for a fighting patrol here again my instincts

703
01:11:18.80 --> 01:11:26.16
and experience did not conform to their teaching he's a rebel how can you command and control

704
01:11:26.16 --> 01:11:31.84
that number of men in the dark particularly in a skirmish Douglas the company commander

705
01:11:31.84 --> 01:11:40.08
tolerant of the absent absonancy of my opinions on these matters left the planning to me

706
01:11:40.80 --> 01:11:45.76
so cool Douglas is little decentralized command you figure out your plan then I like this the

707
01:11:45.76 --> 01:11:52.32
composition of the patrol I based on personalities and not on a battle school or day number so

708
01:11:52.32 --> 01:11:56.40
imagine that you're you're planning based on the personalities of the individuals you have

709
01:11:56.40 --> 01:12:02.32
the countryside being comparatively open I decided to take a bread gun being steady

710
01:12:02.32 --> 01:12:08.08
Williams and Filmer would fill the bill admirably if we ran into trouble they could provide

711
01:12:08.08 --> 01:12:12.24
covering fire for any assault we might make or if things went badly they could cover our

712
01:12:12.24 --> 01:12:19.20
withdrawal cover move obviously the assault party required strengthening so I decided to take a

713
01:12:19.20 --> 01:12:25.44
total patrol strength of six men one brand with seven magazines and three armed with stands

714
01:12:25.44 --> 01:12:31.60
with five magazines and four thirty six grenades each plus a pair of wire cutters I carried my

715
01:12:31.60 --> 01:12:37.76
cult four grenades and a non-brella my umbrella had been a source of amusement to the

716
01:12:37.76 --> 01:12:44.40
battoons inside found on the roadside in muc apart from keeping me dry in or out of a slit trench

717
01:12:44.40 --> 01:12:50.96
it was useful when prodding for mines and brought some fun and color to our lives Jim Kingston and Doug

718
01:12:50.96 --> 01:12:58.08
Proctor fought otherwise maintaining a disapproving silence which I failed to notice so now they're

719
01:12:58.08 --> 01:13:01.68
out on patrol moving down the bank the right we crawled forward in the mud and wet grass into

720
01:13:01.68 --> 01:13:08.16
we're almost past the orchard from which came the sound of digging and voices suddenly a challenge

721
01:13:08.16 --> 01:13:14.000
came from our front followed by a shower of stick grenades thrown from a trench just inside the

722
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.56
orchard on our left one of the grenades landed between my legs which were stretched out

723
01:13:20.56 --> 01:13:26.64
and spread apart as I lay flat on the river bank there was no flash it's explosions seemed

724
01:13:26.64 --> 01:13:35.04
muffled and more importantly owing to the soft mud I received not a scratch the game was up now

725
01:13:35.04 --> 01:13:39.92
the concentrated fire of the three stands poured into the German into the surprise Germans putting

726
01:13:39.92 --> 01:13:46.08
away my pistol I threw three thirty six grenades in quick succession into the orchard heardly

727
01:13:46.08 --> 01:13:54.80
reaching from my umbrella which alluded me and then enormously, economically we'd be to retreat so

728
01:13:57.60 --> 01:14:01.76
he gets a graze throw on him and actually had this happen until you bruiser some guys were out on a

729
01:14:01.76 --> 01:14:07.84
patrol they were an open field they had cover from one side because they had pre-plant how they were

730
01:14:07.84 --> 01:14:11.68
in a crosses field and while they were out there they got hit with machine gun fire and then mortars

731
01:14:11.68 --> 01:14:21.84
and they got mortars dating like on them and luckily because it was they were in like a muddy

732
01:14:21.84 --> 01:14:29.36
field like almost rice paddy scenario the mortars when they hit they went into the mud and so they

733
01:14:29.36 --> 01:14:34.72
exploded but there was no all the these trappinals all absorbed by the mud that's lucky day for

734
01:14:34.72 --> 01:14:42.16
the u-briser right there boys were a little more fired up when they came back from that one now they

735
01:14:42.16 --> 01:14:48.48
get back into a defensive perimeter I remember nights in defensive positions like grows beak stretched

736
01:14:48.48 --> 01:14:53.60
out in a slit trunch trying to get an hour sleep before going round the platoon positions to check

737
01:14:53.60 --> 01:15:00.16
that everything and everyone was all right one felt and was dirty and in the small hours of the

738
01:15:00.16 --> 01:15:06.32
morning with bootlaces cutting into swollen feet of foul tasting mouth and an aching snowmick

739
01:15:06.32 --> 01:15:12.24
life had little to commend it the dirt and discomfort worried me more than the danger

740
01:15:12.96 --> 01:15:19.76
danger for some reason that I've never understood exilorates but despite every effort to keep clean

741
01:15:19.76 --> 01:15:28.16
it did not always prove possible and that was unbearable never once since I never once since

742
01:15:28.16 --> 01:15:34.08
have I not been grateful to sink into a hop bath or slide into a bed with clean sheets

743
01:15:35.28 --> 01:15:41.60
we went to extraordinary lengths to keep the dirt at bay once in Normandy I washed and shaved

744
01:15:41.60 --> 01:15:49.76
in the rainwater in the deep ruts made by carts after words I discovered that 400 yards away

745
01:15:49.76 --> 01:15:57.92
the opposition had been overlooking my ablutions a decent lot who obviously approved

746
01:15:57.92 --> 01:16:04.32
of my personal hygiene so they didn't kill him hey this guy's just trying to be clean let's

747
01:16:04.32 --> 01:16:10.32
let him continue back to the book during the campaign 18 platoon carried out three types of

748
01:16:10.32 --> 01:16:17.04
patrols reconnaissance standing and fighting the first two invariably useful because they provided

749
01:16:17.04 --> 01:16:22.88
information if only negative fighting patrols of which I led many were a different and

750
01:16:22.88 --> 01:16:28.72
contentious proposition unlike the German and American armies we had vigorous policy regarding

751
01:16:28.72 --> 01:16:34.000
fighting patrols particularly at night and when things were static on both sides on the defense

752
01:16:35.60 --> 01:16:41.12
the thinking behind this policy seemed to me at times to be superficial and probably left over

753
01:16:41.12 --> 01:16:47.52
from the great war world war one if when detailed for a fighting patrol young officers

754
01:16:47.52 --> 01:16:53.68
queried the wisdom of its given object there was always the standard reply I quite agree with you

755
01:16:53.68 --> 01:17:00.48
but it all helps to dominate no man's land there is undoubtedly a certain validity of this argument

756
01:17:01.20 --> 01:17:07.36
but was it worth the consequent loss of good young officers and nco's I doubt it

757
01:17:07.36 --> 01:17:16.72
shortly after the war I was able to briefly voice my reservations to my illustrious army group commander

758
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:25.68
that's Montgomery by the way after giving me my MC that's military cross ribbon he stepped back

759
01:17:26.24 --> 01:17:34.56
and said crispy patrolling his bloody isn't it when I stammered that it seemed a bit hard that

760
01:17:34.56 --> 01:17:42.08
it was always the same people chosen for patrols he replied with a twinkle as I one day you'll

761
01:17:42.08 --> 01:17:50.80
command a battalion and you'll understand the problem for 20 year old subaltern exchange like this

762
01:17:50.80 --> 01:17:55.12
with a field marshal was heavy stuff but Monti's mischievous humor and utter lack of

763
01:17:55.12 --> 01:18:01.84
formosity coupled with a single-minded professionalism extended his personal influence to the

764
01:18:01.84 --> 01:18:12.56
most junior soldier in 21st Army group we felt we knew him and that he knew us often he did so

765
01:18:14.80 --> 01:18:22.48
that's a great little interaction you know he says patrolling his bloody work isn't it and and

766
01:18:23.44 --> 01:18:29.68
Sydney Jerry says yeah and the thing is it seems like it's always the same platoons that get made to

767
01:18:29.68 --> 01:18:34.96
do the patrolling and he says one day when you're in charge of battalion you'll understand why that is

768
01:18:36.32 --> 01:18:39.68
and the reason why that is because you got the good guy and that's the guy you're going to send out

769
01:18:40.64 --> 01:18:43.04
you're going to rely on the people that get it done

770
01:18:49.20 --> 01:18:53.52
well this is an interesting we got another patrol that they're getting ready to have to go out on

771
01:18:53.52 --> 01:19:00.08
and the patrol was to probe between the roads and advance if possible as far as the forest

772
01:19:00.72 --> 01:19:06.000
beyond this its purpose was indeed vague Douglas called me and another platoon commander to

773
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.88
company HQ and explained it to us he then suggested we should toss a coin for an embarrassing

774
01:19:12.88 --> 01:19:19.44
situation arose I thought that the winner would lead the patrol the other officer anticipated that

775
01:19:19.44 --> 01:19:25.60
the loser would I lost the toss and got the job so so imagine that you and me are saying all right

776
01:19:25.60 --> 01:19:30.88
there's a dangerous patrol we're going to have to do let's flip for it I'm thinking heads

777
01:19:32.08 --> 01:19:37.04
if I win I get to do the patrol you're thinking if you win you don't have to do the patrol

778
01:19:40.24 --> 01:19:43.92
not everyone was quite as fired up I guess this is Sydney Jerry was

779
01:19:43.92 --> 01:19:55.28
and they they wrap up a relatively kind of un-eventful patrol relatively un-eventful patrol

780
01:19:56.40 --> 01:20:02.72
and he returns and they're having a cup of tea and some biscuits in true British form

781
01:20:03.44 --> 01:20:07.52
back to the book it was then that I suddenly realized that I've been commanding 18 platoon for three months

782
01:20:08.24 --> 01:20:13.68
to be precise three months and two days before I'd join the battalion in mid-July I'd been

783
01:20:13.68 --> 01:20:21.52
worn that my life expectancy would be about three weeks it seemed strange to me now but at no

784
01:20:21.52 --> 01:20:28.16
time did I anticipate being either wounded or killed I was just too busy for thoughts like

785
01:20:28.16 --> 01:20:34.48
reason and I'd become totally absorbed in my grim responsibilities in July I'd been ridden

786
01:20:35.20 --> 01:20:43.04
by doubt about my ability in my innocence I'd expected success in battle to be the

787
01:20:43.04 --> 01:20:54.72
prerogative of a Victor Lodorum which is like the champion I now had no such doubts or illusions

788
01:20:54.72 --> 01:21:02.16
furthermore I discovered just how much soldiers present and fear a young officer who sees battle

789
01:21:02.16 --> 01:21:10.24
as a means to win his spurs possibly at the cost of their lives so when you grow

790
01:21:10.24 --> 01:21:16.000
in and you're Mr. beating your chests and you're you're gonna prove yourself to the world

791
01:21:17.28 --> 01:21:24.64
yeah don't be that guy because you're gonna write checks with my life and we don't like that

792
01:21:27.52 --> 01:21:32.80
my duty had become clear to me it was to command 18 platoon with quiet confidence

793
01:21:32.80 --> 01:21:41.84
providing I made them only once my mistakes would be forgiven if my soldiers were to go

794
01:21:41.84 --> 01:21:48.32
we're going to place their very lives in my hands they in return were fired of me a

795
01:21:48.32 --> 01:21:57.68
serious attitude to my profession if I could achieve this with a light touch so much the better

796
01:21:57.68 --> 01:22:05.36
that's an interesting comment so you know he's saying look what they require is I got to be

797
01:22:05.36 --> 01:22:11.52
serious I got to be a serious as possible and it's like it's like it's like it's heard the term

798
01:22:11.52 --> 01:22:15.44
minimum force required yes yeah you probably probably use that as a balancer right

799
01:22:15.44 --> 01:22:19.20
hey you got to use the minimum force required so what he's saying is that as a leader

800
01:22:20.24 --> 01:22:25.20
the lighter touch the better the lightest touch you can use to lead is better that's

801
01:22:25.20 --> 01:22:31.60
pretty cool statement that's a good thing to think about how can you lead with minimum force

802
01:22:32.48 --> 01:22:40.24
every time you go you need to use more than you then you need your your over-exerting right

803
01:22:43.28 --> 01:22:48.16
and who knows what kind of you know you're taking away initiative you might be stamping out

804
01:22:48.16 --> 01:22:56.80
morale so lead with that minimum touch I like that so and this point they're in a

805
01:22:58.16 --> 01:23:04.80
they're in a position and there's three of these mark three 75 millimeter self-propelled

806
01:23:04.80 --> 01:23:09.68
assault guns so they kind of look like tanks they got big tracks their Germans their German

807
01:23:09.68 --> 01:23:13.76
and their and they're sitting out in front of them they're in a they're in a static position

808
01:23:13.76 --> 01:23:20.40
the companies in the static position and there's these these tanks sitting there three of them

809
01:23:21.52 --> 01:23:26.24
and Douglas looks at them and he's thinking himself hey I don't know what does they they look like

810
01:23:26.24 --> 01:23:33.28
they're functioning they don't look damaged and so Douglas is saying okay well we need to find

811
01:23:33.28 --> 01:23:37.12
out what's going on even if there's no one even if there's no one in them right now it could be

812
01:23:37.12 --> 01:23:46.96
a place where they use snipers later so someone's got to go check them out so Sydney Jerry the guy

813
01:23:47.52 --> 01:23:52.24
he goes out alone kind of sneaks out there he does stuff alone a little bit more often

814
01:23:52.80 --> 01:23:57.52
actually does stuff alone there's another story I didn't mention but at one point

815
01:23:58.48 --> 01:24:03.44
their he hears noise look one of the guy's reports it's nighttime and they hear the

816
01:24:03.44 --> 01:24:07.76
hear noise in this field they think there's enemy out there and he's like well there's one way to

817
01:24:07.76 --> 01:24:14.16
find out so he I think he does grab another guy in this occasion but he goes out and he's going through

818
01:24:14.16 --> 01:24:20.16
this field and it's like a corn field or something and he can't see and he's horrified and he

819
01:24:20.16 --> 01:24:25.36
he's trying to think of a reason to quit he's like I just want to go back this isn't smart

820
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.28
and as he's as this is taking place and this is fear is climaxing all of a sudden he hears

821
01:24:31.28 --> 01:24:41.52
oh, bunch of cows that have fielded right so he's doing another solo operation here

822
01:24:42.80 --> 01:24:47.84
trying to find out what these tank like assault guns are doing out there back to the book

823
01:24:47.84 --> 01:24:54.56
climbing up above the tracks I put my head into the coupla which was open a familiar

824
01:24:54.56 --> 01:25:02.56
interrible stench hit me inside was a sharnell house six inches away a set of bear teeth

825
01:25:02.56 --> 01:25:11.60
set in unrecognizable black and incinerated lump grinned it me beside it a charred and bony arm

826
01:25:11.60 --> 01:25:19.36
reached up in agony spread on the floor like a pool of tar lay the melted remains of the driver

827
01:25:19.36 --> 01:25:30.24
I had entered Dante's inferno my head reeled and with my mouth knows and lungs filled with the

828
01:25:30.24 --> 01:25:38.32
stench of death I fell back to the ground although unmarked by fire on all on our side all three

829
01:25:38.32 --> 01:25:43.28
assault guns had brood up and were blackened on their sides which faced the enemy

830
01:25:43.28 --> 01:25:50.24
with no stomach to look further I ran back to the company for getting to look for American minds

831
01:25:51.76 --> 01:25:55.36
never again did I look into a knocked-out tank or self-propelled gun

832
01:25:56.56 --> 01:26:03.52
I reported to Douglas that nobody in the right mind would use them for an observation post or for any other purpose

833
01:26:06.24 --> 01:26:12.24
later that day he asked that's Douglas Douglas asked the commander of a Sherman tank to fire some

834
01:26:12.24 --> 01:26:17.76
armor piercing shells into each of them positioning his tank hold down beside 16

835
01:26:17.76 --> 01:26:22.72
platoon positions which were two are left the tank commanders the tank commander first

836
01:26:22.72 --> 01:26:28.88
selected the assault gun I had visited his first shell hit it slightly above the tracks

837
01:26:29.68 --> 01:26:37.44
like the hammer of Vulcan a red glow blossomed on the armor plate around the point of entry and

838
01:26:37.44 --> 01:26:43.92
slowly faded it was followed by a second and third shell until a morage of heat appeared above it

839
01:26:43.92 --> 01:26:49.28
and for a second time the funeral pyre blazed with an incandescent ferocity

840
01:26:50.72 --> 01:26:56.24
the Sherman gunner then turned his attention to the next assault gun which despite being penetrated by

841
01:26:56.24 --> 01:27:03.36
about six armor piercing rounds failed to brew up his first shot at the third caused a massive

842
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:10.72
internal detonation no doubt due to amination stacked within a volcano erupted from its coppola

843
01:27:11.44 --> 01:27:18.48
sending a dense cloud of black smoke and red sparks into the air a truly

844
01:27:19.12 --> 01:27:24.40
wagonarian end for the warriors entuned within but it revolted me

845
01:27:24.40 --> 01:27:34.08
for the rest of the day I brooded this communicated itself to my nco's and soldiers who stole

846
01:27:34.08 --> 01:27:37.92
mystified glances at my grief for an unknown enemy

847
01:27:39.60 --> 01:27:45.04
during the afternoon I wandered across the road to a lone house where Dennis Clark had his observation post

848
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.64
I was looking for solace from a wise and good friend

849
01:27:48.64 --> 01:27:54.000
a post was filled with gunner officers there must have been a dozen of them

850
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.32
setting up their equipment and preparation for an attack by 214 brigade

851
01:27:59.60 --> 01:28:02.40
this activity precluded any solace for me

852
01:28:04.32 --> 01:28:11.68
immature and undisciplined my imagination ran riot what were they like these men whose already

853
01:28:11.68 --> 01:28:18.32
incinerated remains had been blasted into oblivion by the 75 millimeter shells of our

854
01:28:18.32 --> 01:28:28.24
friend in the Sherman my attitude to war was ambivalent undoubtedly I was part pacifist

855
01:28:28.24 --> 01:28:33.92
but despite an abysmal record in mathematics and particularly in geometry I was

856
01:28:33.92 --> 01:28:40.64
moderately logical for my age this clearly ruled out total dedication to pacifism

857
01:28:42.08 --> 01:28:47.04
I had previously discussed the concept of conscious objection with clergy of all

858
01:28:47.04 --> 01:28:51.36
denominations but none of them could give me constructive answers to my questions

859
01:28:54.64 --> 01:28:58.40
the privations and suffering of 18 putoon hurt me

860
01:29:00.64 --> 01:29:06.16
an infantry subaltern is faced with a conflict which cannot be resolved

861
01:29:08.24 --> 01:29:12.48
one gets emotionally involved with those under one's command

862
01:29:12.48 --> 01:29:20.56
without this bond few men will respond and consequently little can be achieved

863
01:29:22.88 --> 01:29:31.20
however to win battles decisions have to be taken and orders given which at times may seem to be

864
01:29:31.20 --> 01:29:33.12
a betrayal of this trust

865
01:29:35.60 --> 01:29:41.04
before battle the commander must exude confidence and enthusiasm

866
01:29:41.04 --> 01:29:48.56
whatever fears his private thoughts may hold just how thin the line divides this

867
01:29:48.56 --> 01:29:55.12
from deliberate deception I call it the commander's dilemma

868
01:29:56.24 --> 01:30:00.08
a pretentious phrase but there is nothing to be done about it

869
01:30:02.64 --> 01:30:09.28
the Nicholas Montserrat's book the cruel sea poor commander Eric Itson makes the point with

870
01:30:09.28 --> 01:30:20.40
poignancy it's the war the whole bloody war we've just got to do these things and say our prayers at the end

871
01:30:24.08 --> 01:30:27.20
there was another side possibly caused by adrenaline

872
01:30:29.20 --> 01:30:37.60
danger attracted and excited me I felt elated and until the battle was over I was impervious to

873
01:30:37.60 --> 01:30:44.40
exhaustion commanding a platoon embattled demands not only a clear mind but also considerable

874
01:30:44.40 --> 01:30:53.28
emotional force I suspected is the same transmitted force that exists between a conductor and

875
01:30:53.28 --> 01:31:04.16
orchestra 40 years later the dilemma of my ambivalence is still unresolved I find the suffering

876
01:31:04.16 --> 01:31:09.84
inflicted by war unacceptable particularly amongst women children and animals

877
01:31:12.32 --> 01:31:18.56
thank God I was spared the horrific sights at felays on some days I am a pacifist

878
01:31:20.32 --> 01:31:27.04
and yet I'm still attracted by the sounds of guns and but for an extraordinarily happy marriage

879
01:31:27.04 --> 01:31:35.92
would have found it difficult to resist the lore of soldiering

880
01:31:38.48 --> 01:31:47.44
so what he calls the commanders dilemma this one I call the dichotomy of leadership and that one is the

881
01:31:47.44 --> 01:32:01.60
premier of them all and that is as a leader as a combat leader you are going to love your men

882
01:32:04.64 --> 01:32:13.92
and care about them more than anything else in the world and with that you are going to

883
01:32:13.92 --> 01:32:23.04
make decisions and make plans where you are sending those men into a situation where they can be wounded

884
01:32:23.04 --> 01:32:33.84
or killed and that's it and that is the ultimate dichotomy of leadership that is the hardest one to balance

885
01:32:33.84 --> 01:32:50.000
it back to the book a new officer arrived named Humphrey's he used to play cricket for warstisher

886
01:32:51.68 --> 01:32:56.40
he came on the same day that sergeant Oxlyn received a well-earned commission in the field

887
01:32:56.40 --> 01:33:02.96
Douglas told him about sergeant Oxlyn and with great consideration he went to 17

888
01:33:02.96 --> 01:33:10.88
platoon's position to offer his congratulations while they talked just one salvo of one oh five

889
01:33:10.88 --> 01:33:18.40
straddled them one shell fell into second lieutenant Oxlyn's slit trench and both were killed instantly

890
01:33:18.40 --> 01:33:28.64
like me can Oxlyn has survived five months Humphrey's survives not a full day

891
01:33:32.08 --> 01:33:36.80
is there a mathematical formula by which survival can be calculated

892
01:33:39.20 --> 01:33:46.96
who are the survivors and can they be recognized over the past 40 years I've often pondered this

893
01:33:46.96 --> 01:33:54.56
but still offer no real answer I suspect however that is something to do with attitude attitude

894
01:33:54.56 --> 01:34:02.08
seems to me to be a parameter which restricts not only our relationships but also our creative effort

895
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.52
further comment is on wise Humphrey's one cargue had little time to develop an attitude

896
01:34:11.52 --> 01:34:20.08
to our kind of existence undoubtedly a self-fulfilling circle develops newcomers inexperienced in the

897
01:34:20.08 --> 01:34:28.16
perils of the battlefield suffered the highest casualties knowledge of what can and what cannot be

898
01:34:28.16 --> 01:34:37.20
wrists post-pones the fatal reckoning for the soldier for the commander however junior battle

899
01:34:37.20 --> 01:34:42.88
field experience will not only protect himself but also all those under his command

900
01:34:46.72 --> 01:34:54.24
and that's that's why training is so important it's so important and that's why when I got

901
01:34:54.24 --> 01:34:59.28
done with you know deployment to her body that's why I went to training because I knew that right there

902
01:35:01.04 --> 01:35:04.48
and I was thinking you know I didn't know I was wrong the war was going to last and when we left

903
01:35:04.48 --> 01:35:10.96
for money where money was still horrible and when the task unit came in relieved us man they were

904
01:35:10.96 --> 01:35:16.24
getting after it and I didn't know long that was going to last I mean it ended up not lasting that

905
01:35:16.24 --> 01:35:23.36
much longer that kind of intense fighting but it was impossible to tell at that time we would just

906
01:35:23.36 --> 01:35:29.84
barely seeing stuff start to get better at the end of our deployment just barely starting to see

907
01:35:29.84 --> 01:35:44.000
the first indications of that back to the book the fifth Duke of Cornwall's light infantry

908
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.92
had attempted to attack Hove and village through these ghastly woods and had taken heavy casualties

909
01:35:50.96 --> 01:35:57.12
their reign soaked bodies littered the paths and clearings while carrying out a reconnaissance I

910
01:35:57.12 --> 01:36:02.72
came across one of their sections lying along a small path facing the enemy

911
01:36:04.16 --> 01:36:08.48
at first I fought them alive until I saw that the studs on their boots were rusty

912
01:36:09.12 --> 01:36:15.84
and their webbing equipment was bleached with rain their battle dress was starched with mud

913
01:36:15.84 --> 01:36:23.52
and their hands and faces were green German booby traps were on or near many of the tracks

914
01:36:23.52 --> 01:36:29.28
and I was told by the company commander of the fourth wheelchairs from whom we took over the position

915
01:36:29.28 --> 01:36:35.36
that some of the bodies were also booby trapped don't try to bury them he said

916
01:36:37.20 --> 01:36:42.08
I was temporarily commanding the company because Douglas had been given a well deserved leave in

917
01:36:42.08 --> 01:36:48.80
Brussels although militarily comparatively un-adventful Hove and has a special place in my memories

918
01:36:48.80 --> 01:36:54.96
it was without doubt my most the most grizzly and horrifying position that we ever hold held

919
01:36:54.96 --> 01:37:00.24
but more importantly it was the place of private Charles Raven's triumph

920
01:37:02.80 --> 01:37:08.80
Raven had fought in all our battles since hill 112 which to him was a yardstick of horror

921
01:37:10.08 --> 01:37:14.40
all subsequent experience was compared with that his first battle

922
01:37:14.40 --> 01:37:23.76
he was no soldier I doubt if he influenced greatly any of the skirmishes and counters or battles

923
01:37:23.76 --> 01:37:29.68
in which he took part sometimes he was frightened and he was so out of place on the battlefield

924
01:37:29.68 --> 01:37:36.80
that I often wondered how he became an infantry soldier before the war he had been a clerk in north

925
01:37:36.80 --> 01:37:44.96
London I'm sure he was a conscientious and loyal employee and a considerate and loving husband

926
01:37:44.96 --> 01:37:53.84
for unlike most of us he was married Raven had hidden depths and could be inspired

927
01:37:54.96 --> 01:38:00.88
once in Normandy during a nasty little platoon attack up a sunken lane 18 platoon was held up by

928
01:38:00.88 --> 01:38:07.68
the inevitable unlocated spandows straining my eyes through binoculars I was trying

929
01:38:07.68 --> 01:38:14.16
vainly to locate these guns when I was handed a steaming mug of tea he should have been

930
01:38:14.16 --> 01:38:21.84
observing to his front but judging the moment right he had brewed a mess tin of tea on a solid fuel stove

931
01:38:21.84 --> 01:38:31.68
by any standards this was an inspired act he was considerate with our reinforcements pale

932
01:38:31.68 --> 01:38:37.36
unsure men some of whom until recently it served in the royal artillery and it been transferred

933
01:38:37.36 --> 01:38:42.72
to infantry regiments to replace the appalling losses incurred in the Normandy Bocage

934
01:38:44.80 --> 01:38:50.08
beside them Raven looked bronze in weather beaten a hardened campaigner

935
01:38:50.08 --> 01:38:57.36
complete with a German luger pistol to prove it some of the platoon regaled the reinforcements

936
01:38:57.36 --> 01:39:04.64
with horrible tails from Normandy and else as little more than a schoolboy I found these stories

937
01:39:04.64 --> 01:39:16.16
amusing Raven did not fear for him was horribly real and never to be joked about he developed a

938
01:39:16.16 --> 01:39:21.52
eternal attitude toward the newer and younger soldiers a relationship devoid of patronage

939
01:39:21.52 --> 01:39:30.08
but essentially one of kindly understanding he spoke to me about it when I thanked him for his help

940
01:39:31.36 --> 01:39:38.000
I admit I'm dead windy sir his extraordinary honesty with himself and the rest of the platoon

941
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:45.44
forbade him to attempt to hide the fact Raven in overtaxed his nervous and physical resources

942
01:39:45.44 --> 01:39:52.96
long before we arrived in hoven woods after two days in the position he came to me late one

943
01:39:52.96 --> 01:40:00.08
evening and asked my permission to report sick the following morning I suppose I should

944
01:40:00.08 --> 01:40:05.04
and fettically have refused but something made me hesitate and avoid dealing directly with the

945
01:40:05.04 --> 01:40:10.64
situation I said simply all right Raven but do come see me before you leave

946
01:40:10.64 --> 01:40:21.84
he didn't come the matter was never again mentioned I can only surmised the struggle which

947
01:40:21.84 --> 01:40:27.68
rage in his mind all that night while he crouched in his waterlogs slit trunch peering into the

948
01:40:27.68 --> 01:40:38.40
sinister darkness of the wood I do know however that in hoven wood a considerable moral triumph

949
01:40:38.40 --> 01:40:46.64
over stark horror was achieved by a good man unequipped for nature unequipped by nature for war

950
01:40:48.24 --> 01:40:58.16
in my view the bravest of the brave so that guy Raven had been through all this stuff and

951
01:40:58.16 --> 01:41:04.08
just barely held the line and finally he was going to break finally he was going to break

952
01:41:04.08 --> 01:41:10.80
and he comes to city gerian says hey I'm gonna go sick tomorrow send the gerian says okay come

953
01:41:10.80 --> 01:41:15.52
and see me before you go it doesn't come back it doesn't come back to him doesn't go sick

954
01:41:19.12 --> 01:41:25.04
back to the book infantry warfare is wretched business it makes physical and emotional demands

955
01:41:25.04 --> 01:41:32.32
on participants that run contrary to all human instinct the strong minority must quietly help

956
01:41:32.32 --> 01:41:39.76
the weak majority to me that is the essence of good teamwork and that jewel in the crown of the

957
01:41:39.76 --> 01:41:47.04
British army the regimental system is the strong foundation upon which we all knowingly or unknowingly

958
01:41:47.04 --> 01:41:57.04
relied so there's going to be some people that deal with it better than others

959
01:41:57.04 --> 01:42:10.32
and you got to help um here's a situation they set up early warning flares so little trip wires

960
01:42:11.44 --> 01:42:18.64
in case to to notify them if the enemies move and down one of their flanks and here we go back to the

961
01:42:18.64 --> 01:42:22.56
book after about 10 minutes had passed we heard the popping of mortars behind hoven village in a

962
01:42:22.56 --> 01:42:27.92
concentration of bombs fell in the fields where we had laid the flares suddenly our left flank

963
01:42:27.92 --> 01:42:35.12
was vividly illuminated as flair after flair ignited knowing little about these flares we had laid

964
01:42:35.12 --> 01:42:40.80
them with the trip wires to talk had we allowed a degree of slack the flares were not a

965
01:42:40.80 --> 01:42:51.44
vergnited my fault I should have known had to fill the extreme ownership from Sydney Jerry and therefore y'all

966
01:42:56.32 --> 01:43:03.60
now he's talking about the attitudes of the soldiers and how soldiers you know there was a

967
01:43:03.60 --> 01:43:09.04
claim he read an article years after the war that said that people you know people became brutal

968
01:43:09.04 --> 01:43:17.68
from the from the war and here's what he says back to the book does war brutalize one can only

969
01:43:17.68 --> 01:43:24.24
speak from personal experience but I think not certainly no soldier of mine was made brutal rather the

970
01:43:24.24 --> 01:43:32.40
opposite war developed in 18 puttune consideration for comrades and humanity towards civilians

971
01:43:32.40 --> 01:43:39.76
and prisoners of war I was proud of my soldiers then and this sentiment has increased with the passing

972
01:43:39.76 --> 01:43:46.72
of years I would not suggest that the naturally brutal might not find in war and outland for their

973
01:43:46.72 --> 01:43:54.56
brutality however that war does not brutalize the type of decent man the type of decent and fair-minded

974
01:43:54.56 --> 01:44:02.16
young English men whom I had the very great honor to command we were not an aggressive generation

975
01:44:02.16 --> 01:44:06.80
a fact which may explain my failure to understand some present day attitudes in the armed

976
01:44:06.80 --> 01:44:15.44
services particularly in the royal marines and the parachute regimen possibly a degree of personal

977
01:44:15.44 --> 01:44:21.28
aggression is appropriate in troops are who are committed to battle for comparatively short periods

978
01:44:21.28 --> 01:44:27.92
like the marines and the paras when the success of an operation depends on ultra rapid action

979
01:44:27.92 --> 01:44:34.48
however in my experience troops lose personal aggression after about two months in battle

980
01:44:35.84 --> 01:44:42.08
after three months they acquire a mature compassion which in no way detracts from their offensive

981
01:44:42.08 --> 01:44:50.40
capability they simply know a lot more about war I would suggest that personal aggression should

982
01:44:50.40 --> 01:44:57.52
not be confused with offensive spirit based on professional competence and experience

983
01:44:59.84 --> 01:45:07.84
interesting take that aggression that you can maintain if you it's not going to last rubber

984
01:45:07.84 --> 01:45:20.96
and and then you're going to have to fall back on duty and and that mature compassion

985
01:45:20.96 --> 01:45:23.20
which isn't taken away from their offensive capability

986
01:45:29.60 --> 01:45:30.24
interesting

987
01:45:30.24 --> 01:45:40.80
back to book on the eleventh of January we returned to the south of the union just to go back

988
01:45:40.80 --> 01:45:46.48
to that one piece right there dichotomy leadership there's a dichotomy and everything and

989
01:45:46.48 --> 01:45:52.72
you know obviously I'm a big proponent of being aggressive and I also always talk about the fact

990
01:45:52.72 --> 01:45:58.000
that there is such a thing being too aggressive you're running to your death no not a good idea

991
01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.64
not a good idea and there's probably a good chance that when he talks about people

992
01:46:03.76 --> 01:46:09.20
after two months of combat everyone starts to develop a different type of attitude also

993
01:46:09.20 --> 01:46:14.48
the people that were ultra aggressive didn't make it like the like the leader that he talked about

994
01:46:14.48 --> 01:46:18.48
that was strutting around the guy was ultra aggressive didn't care about anything and he's dead

995
01:46:20.32 --> 01:46:24.88
so there's a balance you got to have that's the dichotomy leadership that's why the dichotomy

996
01:46:24.88 --> 01:46:34.08
of leadership is so important and so hard to understand back to the book on the day after the

997
01:46:34.08 --> 01:46:39.28
batain was relieved and hoven wood someone I suspect I suspect it was the adjutant

998
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Tim Watson decided that I should enjoy 48 hours on leave in Antwerp I was overjoyed

999
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.80
the large hotel although faded was still plush and filled with officers including women

1000
01:46:54.80 --> 01:46:58.88
ATS officers from the various base units stationed in the city

1001
01:46:59.84 --> 01:47:03.68
dressed as I had left the battlefield I was both the shavold and soiled

1002
01:47:04.72 --> 01:47:10.32
surrounded by the residents many of whom were in service dress I could not have felt more isolated and

1003
01:47:10.32 --> 01:47:18.64
lonely so he's getting some leave time but he's showing up off the battlefield to grimey my first

1004
01:47:18.64 --> 01:47:24.08
map visit was to a magnificent white marble gentleman's hair dressing salon in the basement of a hotel

1005
01:47:25.20 --> 01:47:30.32
without a word the barber washed and rinsed my hair twice before touching it with his precious

1006
01:47:30.32 --> 01:47:38.16
scissors and clippers I remember the feeling of well-being as climbing the stairs I returned to my room

1007
01:47:38.16 --> 01:47:46.64
Next I took three very hot baths one after the other to rid myself of grime both physical

1008
01:47:47.20 --> 01:47:55.60
and emotional I think I must have slept for 14 hours before I rose shaved took another bath

1009
01:47:55.92 --> 01:47:57.60
and decided to explore the city

1010
01:47:59.84 --> 01:48:06.88
A rather creased battle dress was my best suit and in this I descended the main staircase into

1011
01:48:06.88 --> 01:48:13.20
the lounge which was filled with the resident officers all of whom seemed to be a knowingly self-assured

1012
01:48:15.52 --> 01:48:22.96
I met a barrier I had walked out of a world that I knew into one where I was desperately

1013
01:48:22.96 --> 01:48:34.48
unsure of myself away from the battlefield this world had no place for me I did not go out to lunch

1014
01:48:34.48 --> 01:48:40.000
go to night clubs or meet the girls who were everywhere seemed to be canvassing

1015
01:48:40.96 --> 01:48:48.80
for these establishments I had wandered too far into dark and smokey battlefields across the

1016
01:48:48.80 --> 01:48:54.80
sticks to find solace or comfort in the bright lights behind the black-out curtains of Antwerp

1017
01:48:54.80 --> 01:49:05.68
I long to return to the battalion and to 18-platoon which without my knowing it had become my home

1018
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:15.12
with a light heart a clean body freshly laundered clothes and refreshed by hours of unbroken

1019
01:49:15.12 --> 01:49:18.80
sleep I gladly climbed into the three-ton truck that took me there

1020
01:49:18.80 --> 01:49:24.96
years later I found the same problem after I left the army

1021
01:49:26.80 --> 01:49:32.000
Antwerp had been a small taste of the real world and as anyone who has served with good

1022
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:39.68
soldiers on grim battlefields will confirm afterwards real life never seems real again

1023
01:49:39.68 --> 01:49:50.88
later there was no 18-platoon to slink back to and without a loving wife it would have proved

1024
01:49:50.88 --> 01:50:06.24
intolerable well that's the feeling that that we get when you get done doing that job

1025
01:50:06.24 --> 01:50:18.32
and real life never seems real again in comparison I know the vets that are listening to

1026
01:50:18.32 --> 01:50:25.20
understand that part back to the book on 11 January we returned to the South of Holland this time

1027
01:50:25.20 --> 01:50:34.16
to ganglet snow lay on deeply frozen ground and life for the entry and life for the infantry

1028
01:50:34.16 --> 01:50:41.12
manning their slit trenches became unbearable again the battalion front was extensive

1029
01:50:41.12 --> 01:50:45.12
decomponing was in reserve closed close to battalion headquarters on the edge of town

1030
01:50:46.24 --> 01:50:52.000
fortunately gangl it was on a reverse slope which allowed us to move freely during daylight hours

1031
01:50:53.44 --> 01:50:59.92
the cold was penetrating the oil in our automatic weapons froze and until anti-free's

1032
01:50:59.92 --> 01:51:07.04
lubricants were issued our brands were useless holding a wide front with large gaps between

1033
01:51:07.04 --> 01:51:12.48
our company positions necessitated putting out many standing patrols particularly at night

1034
01:51:14.16 --> 01:51:19.04
the privations suffered by these small patrols usually a corpile and three or four men

1035
01:51:19.04 --> 01:51:25.84
were harder than the rest of us some had hallucinations and if you were exactly evacuated

1036
01:51:25.84 --> 01:51:32.32
suffering from exposure keeping fit warm and clean became a great effort

1037
01:51:33.52 --> 01:51:37.84
conversation dried up the platoon became quiet but never merouse

1038
01:51:39.28 --> 01:51:43.52
at one stage I decided they needed cheering up and I wandered around the section post

1039
01:51:43.52 --> 01:51:49.60
ready to chat with all of them it was quite unnecessary I had wrongly judged their mood

1040
01:51:49.60 --> 01:51:55.28
they just wanted to be left alone

1041
01:52:01.52 --> 01:52:07.52
now there's a begin by the book and read the book there's a chaotic battle at a

1042
01:52:07.52 --> 01:52:13.12
pace place called cleave and after the battle at cleave he kind of de-briefs here

1043
01:52:13.76 --> 01:52:18.000
back to the book what instructors at the school of infantry would think about the fighting

1044
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.60
cleave I shuttered a think there resembled no other battle in my experience I had little control

1045
01:52:23.60 --> 01:52:29.60
and it developed into a section commander's battle looking back over the years it seems military

1046
01:52:29.60 --> 01:52:33.44
the totally unprofessional a real wild west chewed out

1047
01:52:34.72 --> 01:52:40.32
tactically the Germans had every advantage we were strung out in a long column amid shattered

1048
01:52:40.32 --> 01:52:45.92
buildings and piles of rubbles with the groups of parachute troops attacking from both sides

1049
01:52:45.92 --> 01:52:50.56
they could sniper us and engage with our with their spandals

1050
01:52:51.92 --> 01:52:55.68
from dozens of positions totally hidden by piles of rubble

1051
01:52:57.36 --> 01:53:02.24
they had the opportunity to concentrate their counter attacks on the narrowest of fronts

1052
01:53:02.24 --> 01:53:06.56
but failed to do to do so so they failed to focus their efforts

1053
01:53:07.28 --> 01:53:13.20
I can only assume that we had the psychological advantage the circumstances being so chaotic and disorganized

1054
01:53:13.20 --> 01:53:18.40
perhaps being Germans they could not overcome their instinct for organization and tightiness

1055
01:53:20.48 --> 01:53:25.92
in the end they departed possibly and discussed leaving us undisputed victors

1056
01:53:33.60 --> 01:53:37.84
on another attack the Germans at this point are retreating

1057
01:53:38.64 --> 01:53:40.48
and they can see that they're retreating

1058
01:53:40.48 --> 01:53:43.92
fearing that the retreating parachute troops would make a stand on the edge of the wood

1059
01:53:43.92 --> 01:53:49.68
I increased the rate of advance joining Lance Corporal Portius in the forward section

1060
01:53:50.88 --> 01:53:55.20
running across the level crossing I suddenly found myself face to face with a germinplatoon

1061
01:53:55.20 --> 01:54:01.76
complete with MG 34 fortunately the gun was mounted on a tripod which was unusual

1062
01:54:01.76 --> 01:54:07.44
and could not be traversed in our direction from a drainage channel on the left of the road

1063
01:54:07.44 --> 01:54:14.80
a parachute is leaped up swath and camouflage veil pointing a schmiser at me from about 10 yards range

1064
01:54:14.80 --> 01:54:18.40
he fired a whole magazine of about 30 rounds

1065
01:54:19.76 --> 01:54:24.80
it was like watching a slow running silent movie I didn't hear the chatter of the schmiser

1066
01:54:24.80 --> 01:54:30.40
but I do remember seeing the stream of empty cartridge cases fly from the German machine gun

1067
01:54:30.40 --> 01:54:37.20
miracles do indeed happen one nine millimeter bullet went through my beret

1068
01:54:38.56 --> 01:54:46.64
missing my head literally by hairs with another went under the appleet of my jacket

1069
01:54:46.64 --> 01:54:51.92
penetrating the webbing across brace the webbing cross brace of my equipment and grazing my

1070
01:54:51.92 --> 01:54:56.88
right shoulder a third bullet ricochet off the surface of the road and disintegrated

1071
01:54:56.88 --> 01:55:03.76
the jacket finally lodging in the palm of my right hand then came the anti climax

1072
01:55:04.56 --> 01:55:10.32
the German looked at me in amazement through ways smiser and eye with a shrug of the shoulders

1073
01:55:10.32 --> 01:55:18.64
he surrendered my natural relation was short lived behind me lay Lance Corporal Portius

1074
01:55:19.68 --> 01:55:26.56
shot through the heart some of the German platoon ran away across the open fields to our

1075
01:55:26.56 --> 01:55:32.88
left and were cut down by rapid fire brand gun by sergeant Kingston section

1076
01:55:33.92 --> 01:55:39.28
which now line the railway track to left the road the remainder of the enemy came towards us

1077
01:55:39.28 --> 01:55:44.88
over the level crossing with their hands raised we took 57 prisoners

1078
01:55:49.84 --> 01:55:54.48
now they're moving along and they are clearing some cottages and they get to this one cottage

1079
01:55:54.48 --> 01:55:59.36
filled with rough wooden bunks it had obviously served as an air raid shelter the house having

1080
01:55:59.36 --> 01:56:04.72
been found clear of enemy jackly was off as guard as he descended the steps suddenly from under a

1081
01:56:04.72 --> 01:56:11.36
pile of blankets left the fanatical German paratrooper the only fanatical German paratrooper we encountered

1082
01:56:11.36 --> 01:56:16.16
the entire battle a large manny sees jack around the throat in an attempt to strangle him

1083
01:56:16.72 --> 01:56:23.60
private fluid rose to the challenge in a bound he was down the steps and with a mighty lunge

1084
01:56:23.60 --> 01:56:30.08
transfixed the German on his bayonet a brave lad he undoubtedly saved Lance Corporal

1085
01:56:30.08 --> 01:56:37.76
Lee's life just eight days before losing his own the German was indeed unlucky as it was the only

1086
01:56:37.76 --> 01:56:44.96
occasion throughout the campaign on which 18 pltunes bayonets were bloodied we usually use them to

1087
01:56:44.96 --> 01:56:53.36
open food cans having checked the pltune positions and arcs of fire for the brins exhaustion

1088
01:56:53.36 --> 01:57:00.24
hit me i fell into a deep sleep during the evening a senior officer i understand it was either

1089
01:57:00.24 --> 01:57:06.000
brigade or divisional commander came out to my company position when he asked to speak to me sergeant

1090
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:12.48
Kingston refused to have me wakened i'm sure that Jim was the most diplomatic about it but it says

1091
01:57:12.48 --> 01:57:28.40
much for our visitors humanity that he let it go by another attack a and c companies were

1092
01:57:28.40 --> 01:57:34.08
unleashed and passing b company secured their objectives against some opposition

1093
01:57:34.88 --> 01:57:39.04
there was now our turn d company advanced across the flat open fields

1094
01:57:39.04 --> 01:57:47.20
down the left hand side of the main road into zan ten it's a name of the city

1095
01:57:48.48 --> 01:57:52.64
village casualties from the preceding companies in the opposition lay all around

1096
01:57:53.28 --> 01:57:59.44
about 300 yards short of the town were extremely accurately engaged by a battery of 105s

1097
01:58:00.16 --> 01:58:04.64
some of their shells exploded on the hard surface the road your splitting detonations

1098
01:58:04.64 --> 01:58:11.12
and frightening fragmentation pieces of shell casing hummed and wind around us one trolling peace

1099
01:58:11.12 --> 01:58:15.52
embedded itself with a foot into the trunk of a tree a few inches from my right ear

1100
01:58:16.72 --> 01:58:20.96
was the only time in the whole campaign when i regretted throwing away my steel helmet

1101
01:58:23.20 --> 01:58:29.52
i think it was the accuracy and the intense noise of the shelling that caused it one of 18

1102
01:58:29.52 --> 01:58:35.84
pertunes lance corpoles a big man who had served honorably since market garden went to pieces

1103
01:58:37.20 --> 01:58:42.72
there was a pathetic site and to everyone's credit he was quietly removed from the battle

1104
01:58:44.48 --> 01:58:47.68
he had passed his limit and nothing more can be said

1105
01:58:51.92 --> 01:58:57.20
so you don't know these guys are brave at one moment and then a week a month two months

1106
01:58:57.20 --> 01:58:59.76
four months they can't do it anymore

1107
01:59:05.60 --> 01:59:11.28
they get across the line now they're fully in Germany there's a little bit of a low in the

1108
01:59:11.28 --> 01:59:16.08
fighting back to the book early one morning while we were waiting for our supporting armor to arrive

1109
01:59:16.08 --> 01:59:22.48
our podry john Williams drove over to see us after wandering around the platoon for a chat he

1110
01:59:22.48 --> 01:59:28.40
suggested he suggested that we should go for a short stroll i had now been commanding 18

1111
01:59:28.40 --> 01:59:37.28
platoon for over eight months and i suspect that our agitant Tim Watson a kindly soul had asked him

1112
01:59:37.28 --> 01:59:45.04
to find out what shape i was in we had not gone far into the next field when he came across

1113
01:59:45.04 --> 01:59:50.64
some grizzly remnants one of our artillery shells must have exploded right at the feet of a

1114
01:59:50.64 --> 01:59:57.92
German soldier who had been digging a slit trench his splintered and twisted spade lay beside

1115
01:59:59.12 --> 02:00:06.56
laid by the side of that half dug trench beside which was a small shell hole he had been

1116
02:00:06.56 --> 02:00:11.04
disintegrated into small pieces of flesh and bone which they scattered all over the field

1117
02:00:11.04 --> 02:00:18.56
had I been on my own I would no doubt have shuttered and quickly departed from this horror

1118
02:00:20.96 --> 02:00:27.04
draped over a wire fence nearby lay a parachute which are extraordinarily brave podry

1119
02:00:27.04 --> 02:00:34.88
spread out as a shroud on the cold and damp grass then stupid he walked around the field

1120
02:00:34.88 --> 02:00:44.64
a lonely figure reverently picking up every piece of that poor soldier to my shame i stood and

1121
02:00:44.64 --> 02:00:57.12
watched him i lacked the courage to help somewhere beneath those flat damp fields just north of the

1122
02:00:57.12 --> 02:01:06.80
line that pallet it pathetic bundle must still lie

1123
02:01:12.48 --> 02:01:21.84
now they're in attack again but it seems like things are going their way and we're going he's

1124
02:01:21.84 --> 02:01:28.24
kind of giving a brief to his to his runner when all of a sudden he hears yelling back to the

1125
02:01:28.24 --> 02:01:34.40
book sir they're charging us sure enough from about 150 yards ahead of well spread out line of

1126
02:01:34.40 --> 02:01:41.20
about 20 Germans were putting in a bayonet charge brave lads they didn't stand a chance

1127
02:01:41.20 --> 02:01:55.20
I gave no orders except cease fire not one got within 75 yards of us a few minutes later

1128
02:01:55.20 --> 02:01:59.92
a possession of Germans with stretchers and a huge red flag emerged from the village behind

1129
02:02:00.88 --> 02:02:05.28
when they were close to their casualties they hesitated so i stood up and waved them on

1130
02:02:05.28 --> 02:02:11.60
all our unarmed stretcher bears and they moved across our front collecting their dead and wounded

1131
02:02:13.44 --> 02:02:18.000
when they had finished their task of mercy one of them i think he must have been a German

1132
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:26.16
medical officer turned and saluted in our direction i returned the salute and with that gesture

1133
02:02:26.16 --> 02:02:36.08
the tiny battle of cinder and ended in bremen little over a month later one of our stretcher bears

1134
02:02:36.08 --> 02:02:42.72
Lance Corporal J. Stevens was killed by a German grenade as he went to tend to wounded German soldier

1135
02:02:42.72 --> 02:02:59.92
18 platoon remembering cinder and were justifiably outraged by such unsolderly behavior

1136
02:03:00.80 --> 02:03:07.12
there is a mathematical formula aggression increases the further one goes behind the lines

1137
02:03:07.12 --> 02:03:14.64
opposing infantry with few exceptions like the SS are joined by a natural bond of mutual compassion

1138
02:03:14.64 --> 02:03:18.48
which few but the aristocracy of the battlefield can understand

1139
02:03:20.40 --> 02:03:25.76
the public influence no doubt by writers with literal no experience of battle have strange and

1140
02:03:25.76 --> 02:03:31.84
sometimes silly ideas about what makes a good soldier ill informed television programs

1141
02:03:31.84 --> 02:03:38.08
of added to this misunderstanding few professions can be have been so misleadingly caricatured

1142
02:03:39.76 --> 02:03:44.88
i had had i been asked at the time before august 1944 to list the personal characteristics

1143
02:03:44.88 --> 02:03:49.68
which go to make a good infantry soldier my reply would indeed have been why to the mark

1144
02:03:49.68 --> 02:03:56.08
why to the mark like most i know doubt one of suggested only masculine ones like aggression

1145
02:03:56.08 --> 02:04:03.36
physical stamina a hunting instinct instinct and competitive nature how wrong i would have been

1146
02:04:04.72 --> 02:04:14.48
i would now suggest the following firstly sufferance without which one could not survive so he's

1147
02:04:14.48 --> 02:04:18.72
listing what he thinks the most important characteristics for a for an infantry soldier out of the first

1148
02:04:18.72 --> 02:04:25.92
one is sufferance the ability to suffer secondly a quiet mind which enables a

1149
02:04:25.92 --> 02:04:30.72
soldier to live in harmony with his fellows through all sorts of difficulties and sometimes under

1150
02:04:30.72 --> 02:04:39.68
dreadful conditions as in a closed monastic existence there's simply no room for the assertive

1151
02:04:39.68 --> 02:04:49.68
or acrimonious thirdly below no less important a sense of the ridiculous which helps the soldiers

1152
02:04:49.68 --> 02:04:57.20
are mount the unacceptable add to these a reasonable standard of physical fitness and a dedicated

1153
02:04:57.20 --> 02:05:05.76
professional competence and you have a soldier for all seasons none of the soldiers or nco's who made

1154
02:05:05.76 --> 02:05:11.44
18-platoon what it was resembled the characters portrayed in most books and films about war

1155
02:05:11.44 --> 02:05:25.84
all quiet sensible unassuming and some by any standard were heroes if i now had to select a team

1156
02:05:25.84 --> 02:05:32.48
for a dangerous mission and my choice was restricted to stars of the sports field or poets

1157
02:05:32.48 --> 02:05:50.08
I would unhazitatingly recruit from the latter very interesting and i mean obviously you have to

1158
02:05:50.08 --> 02:06:00.48
put this in the context of of his time but there's no doubt that i mean you get a sports star

1159
02:06:00.48 --> 02:06:07.44
especially these days those guys that are getting paid 20 30 40 million dollars a year to play a

1160
02:06:07.44 --> 02:06:13.44
game that they're probably not going to be the best at suffering and a trench

1161
02:06:16.88 --> 02:06:23.04
interesting and i think the key point of that is what he's going back to what he talks about

1162
02:06:23.04 --> 02:06:33.60
earlier is someone that can think someone that can think someone that is not trapped in in thinking

1163
02:06:33.60 --> 02:06:40.64
the same faulty everyone else which certainly an artist or a poet has to be outside the box of normal

1164
02:06:40.64 --> 02:06:53.20
fought otherwise they become that they don't become that right in this situation

1165
02:06:55.52 --> 02:07:04.000
is platoon is kind of pinned down and there's an air raid shelter which has someone in it

1166
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.16
is firing these things called a pans or files which is like a it's kind of like a bazooka or

1167
02:07:08.16 --> 02:07:14.72
like an RPG looking thing and he sees where it's coming from and he sees that it's this shelter

1168
02:07:16.40 --> 02:07:20.40
but he doesn't know who's in the shelter here we go back to the kuhu who else was in the shelter

1169
02:07:20.40 --> 02:07:26.40
women and children sheltering more enemy soldiers with more pans or files than spandas

1170
02:07:28.40 --> 02:07:32.80
we were in a vulnerable situation and it was no good pushing forward and ignoring the

1171
02:07:32.80 --> 02:07:38.80
menace lurking inside that shelter i could have sent two or three men to clear it however

1172
02:07:38.80 --> 02:07:45.20
experience a top me that when clearing sellers that the first man sent in is invariably killed

1173
02:07:46.80 --> 02:07:52.000
instead concentrated fire was poured into the entrance included gapiat bomb

1174
02:07:53.52 --> 02:07:59.04
around us the battle still raged and no opportunity to arose from the idea for me to inspect

1175
02:07:59.04 --> 02:08:08.08
the consequences of an awful decision nevertheless my duty was to win battles and not to

1176
02:08:08.08 --> 02:08:15.28
gamble with the lives of my soldiers by fussing over two sensitive conscience so there you go

1177
02:08:15.28 --> 02:08:18.80
there's dichotomy for you at the one hand he's looking at this shelter thinking there might be

1178
02:08:18.80 --> 02:08:22.56
women and kids in there but at this moment in time he doesn't have time to find out and doesn't have

1179
02:08:22.56 --> 02:08:28.40
time to take of the most cautious route so they hammer it with machine gun fire and some

1180
02:08:28.40 --> 02:08:35.52
anti-tank rounds he never even goes to look but he knows that he can't his duty is to win battles

1181
02:08:36.64 --> 02:08:40.24
and he can't diddy dally because he has a sensitive conscience doesn't work

1182
02:08:47.12 --> 02:08:54.40
back to the book Bremer Haven was our final objective it was fifth of May 1945

1183
02:08:54.40 --> 02:09:00.96
19 days before my 21st birthday think about what you were doing you were doing

1184
02:09:00.96 --> 02:09:09.52
and that's what it's just ready to break out we were concentrated at will-stet

1185
02:09:09.52 --> 02:09:18.72
about 20 miles north of Bremen when the end came and by the end I mean the end of the war

1186
02:09:18.72 --> 02:09:27.68
129 brigades order was stand down and spliced the rain brace which is a military it's actually

1187
02:09:27.68 --> 02:09:34.16
a navy term spliced the main brace means like drinking light is lit you can drink the war's over

1188
02:09:35.44 --> 02:09:39.52
I had just given orders for our small part in the brigades move forward against 15

1189
02:09:39.52 --> 02:09:47.84
Panzer Division one of the famous Africa core formations in 1983 Jim Kingston gave me his copy

1190
02:09:47.84 --> 02:09:50.32
of those orders which he had kept all those years

1191
02:09:52.40 --> 02:09:58.96
reaction to the end of the war like aggression increased further behind the lines one went

1192
02:10:00.24 --> 02:10:06.24
the natural aristocracy of the battlefield the infantry having fired a photo joy

1193
02:10:06.24 --> 02:10:15.44
of very lights curled up and slept we had learned too much to indulge in shallow demonstrations

1194
02:10:15.44 --> 02:10:20.16
so everyone's all fireworks and getting crazy these guys are like cool I'm going to sleep

1195
02:10:22.24 --> 02:10:29.44
since July we had come a long way from the Normandy beach head the battalion had lost 47

1196
02:10:29.44 --> 02:10:36.72
officers and 1,266 NCOs and private soldiers killed or wounded

1197
02:10:36.72 --> 02:10:47.76
after July 31st 1944 no member of 18 platoon was put on a charge no one went absent or deserted

1198
02:10:49.28 --> 02:10:55.76
of the original 36 NCOs and soldiers who had landed in Normandy only corpable cheeseman remained

1199
02:10:55.76 --> 02:11:06.08
one man many came after them and lasted a few days weeks or months

1200
02:11:07.92 --> 02:11:15.28
few I was able to thank adequately I doubt if any of them realized how much I personally owed 18

1201
02:11:15.28 --> 02:11:27.68
platoon when I joined them on 31st July I was naive and gouge due to a narrow upbringing except for

1202
02:11:27.68 --> 02:11:34.32
a passionate love of music my intellect and emotions were unstimulated my achievement at school had

1203
02:11:34.32 --> 02:11:43.76
been a bismal my mind was undisciplined and confidence in myself nil this was rapidly swept away

1204
02:11:43.76 --> 02:11:49.92
probably within three weeks certainly before we crossed the sin on the 28th of August

1205
02:11:51.60 --> 02:11:57.12
discovering an ability to command a group of men some frightened and bewildered produced

1206
02:11:57.12 --> 02:12:03.04
a new found confidence particularly since I seem to be able to achieve it quietly and without

1207
02:12:03.04 --> 02:12:11.28
acrimony or fuss having to improvise tactics to overcome the shortcomings of battle school training

1208
02:12:11.28 --> 02:12:17.44
also helped it proved to me that in some circumstances older and more experienced than I

1209
02:12:18.24 --> 02:12:24.80
others older and more experienced than I could be wrong I suspect that as an only child I had been

1210
02:12:24.80 --> 02:12:33.44
brought up in too much of my elders a new world had opened before me forethought and planning were

1211
02:12:33.44 --> 02:12:44.08
demanded a imagination and instinct too was that apparently quiet normandy lane lethal the intense

1212
02:12:44.08 --> 02:12:49.76
spanned outfire and ordering a long a diek was it a prelude to an enemies withdrawal did the

1213
02:12:49.76 --> 02:12:56.24
orchard in front of the village hide 88s my judgment in these things had proved equal to better than

1214
02:12:56.24 --> 02:13:05.60
most of than the most and it was the making of me it also brought a few problems I'm now only

1215
02:13:05.60 --> 02:13:14.48
able to plan and run things in my way as a result I'm probably unemployable however I would never

1216
02:13:14.48 --> 02:13:20.32
wish to change places with the shy hesitant boy whom circumstances put in command of 18ble tune

1217
02:13:20.32 --> 02:13:27.36
age 20 I was far too young and inexperienced to appreciate that an infantry platoon was the finest

1218
02:13:27.36 --> 02:13:33.76
command in the army and that's the success or failure of a battle so often lay solely in the hands

1219
02:13:33.76 --> 02:13:42.32
of a young officer after careful reflection I doubt that at any time since the war have I

1220
02:13:42.32 --> 02:13:53.28
carried the burden of responsibility that I bore as a subaltern in battle when an army corps division

1221
02:13:53.28 --> 02:13:58.56
or brigade was committed to battle it was the battalion company in platoon commanders who took over

1222
02:13:58.56 --> 02:14:06.24
the mantle of responsibility from the generals and brigadiers in close country for us and street

1223
02:14:06.24 --> 02:14:13.68
fighting the platoon commander became the lynch pin only the company and platoon commanders particularly

1224
02:14:13.68 --> 02:14:19.52
the latter were able to have close relationship with their soldiers which is a prerequisite

1225
02:14:19.52 --> 02:14:27.04
for having above average success failure by one infantry company could record a divisional battle plan

1226
02:14:27.04 --> 02:14:35.20
conversely gallant success like B company at Xan 10 underwrote the battalions victory

1227
02:14:37.44 --> 02:14:43.68
again I would emphasize the analog with the bond of professional respect between a great conductor

1228
02:14:43.68 --> 02:14:49.44
and the members of a symphony orchestra without which a truly great performance is not possible

1229
02:14:49.44 --> 02:14:56.32
outstanding performances cannot be arranged in a concert promoters office the created by

1230
02:14:56.32 --> 02:15:03.84
some magic by the conductor in players in rehearsal and performance similarly while senior commanders

1231
02:15:03.84 --> 02:15:08.24
appreciated the strengths and weaknesses of their battions and brigades they could not extract

1232
02:15:08.24 --> 02:15:16.16
a great performance from the riflemen upon whom victory depended only the company of platoon

1233
02:15:16.16 --> 02:15:26.48
commanders supported by their NCOs could ensure that 42 years on I get considerable satisfaction

1234
02:15:26.48 --> 02:15:30.32
from 18 platoon successes more so than I got at the time

1235
02:15:30.32 --> 02:15:48.56
so those are his thoughts and he's the wars now over and a few days after the war ended

1236
02:15:48.56 --> 02:15:59.04
well go to the book after cholera and noculations we were conducted into the world of Frankenstein

1237
02:16:00.80 --> 02:16:07.52
nothing had prepared us for what we now experienced not hill one twelve not mount pinchon

1238
02:16:07.52 --> 02:16:16.000
else or hoven could compete with this horror before the incredulous eyes of 18 platoon spread

1239
02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:20.80
over acres of delightfully wooded countryside was a factory of death

1240
02:16:23.36 --> 02:16:30.16
and they sheaded bodies resembling wax effigies of an alien race from a strange and distant planet

1241
02:16:30.16 --> 02:16:38.24
filled many pits the stench of death and the sight of such highly industrialized

1242
02:16:38.24 --> 02:16:49.92
human degradation left my soldiers speechless private macy d companies deep driver

1243
02:16:49.92 --> 02:16:57.36
aptly summed it up there is now no doubt that we have fought a just war

1244
02:16:57.36 --> 02:17:06.000
that's after they saw the concentration camps obviously

1245
02:17:13.76 --> 02:17:18.96
back to the book within a month of the war ending 21st Army group was required to supply

1246
02:17:18.96 --> 02:17:22.000
junior officers for the 14th Army in Burma

1247
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:29.36
lipy the commanding officer decided that I should be one of them and by then being intent on a

1248
02:17:29.36 --> 02:17:36.80
military career I was not inclined to argue I would gain useful experience of jungle warfare

1249
02:17:37.60 --> 02:17:43.92
of which I knew nothing about so they're getting orders still a war going on in the

1250
02:17:43.92 --> 02:17:48.16
Pacific oh you wrapped up pushing from normandy through germany through their surrender

1251
02:17:48.16 --> 02:17:55.76
guess well we need we need people to go to fight in Asia we need people in Burma

1252
02:17:57.28 --> 02:18:03.68
I was totally unprepared for the platoons for the emotions that were unleashed immediately

1253
02:18:05.12 --> 02:18:14.80
after I was deprived of 18 platoon as a Jeep took me away from the battalion a gas-lead

1254
02:18:14.80 --> 02:18:22.000
desolation and golf to me I felt like a small boy on his way to a grim and unknown boarding school

1255
02:18:24.16 --> 02:18:28.56
the pleasures of commanding 18 platoon and peace time were being denied me

1256
02:18:28.56 --> 02:18:44.000
and it's interesting so he gets pulled away from his platoon and he goes and talk about

1257
02:18:45.52 --> 02:18:53.28
what happened to the guys that survived that he knew and I found this part to be fascinating in the

1258
02:18:53.28 --> 02:19:03.04
how these people went back to normal life back to the book Jim Kingston was demobilized in

1259
02:19:03.04 --> 02:19:09.36
January 1946 and two months later he returned to his civilian post with the Bristol

1260
02:19:09.36 --> 02:19:17.20
Corporation Electricity Department retired in 1975 never married Doug Proctor returned home to

1261
02:19:17.20 --> 02:19:23.76
his wife and baby son and not in Hammond March of 1946 found the transition from army to civilian

1262
02:19:23.76 --> 02:19:27.52
life painless returning to his accounting post in the coal industry

1263
02:19:31.44 --> 02:19:36.72
oh and cheeseman during the first few days of his demobilization is wife died

1264
02:19:38.80 --> 02:19:44.96
miserable and forlorn he returned to his old job in Covent Garden and a few years later

1265
02:19:44.96 --> 02:19:51.20
he met in married Bella who in his own words was a comfort and inspiration to him

1266
02:19:53.60 --> 02:19:57.60
Charles Raven joined the London Transport as a bus conductor

1267
02:19:59.12 --> 02:20:04.96
later transferring to the clerical staff and rose by hard work and study to be a garage inspector

1268
02:20:04.96 --> 02:20:14.56
Joe Thomas and George Harris went into the building trade industry in Bridgewater

1269
02:20:21.60 --> 02:20:31.44
surprisingly just incredibly normal paths after this incredibly not normal life and

1270
02:20:31.44 --> 02:20:37.84
and what happened to Sydney Jerry so here's what happened to Sydney Jerry back to the book

1271
02:20:37.84 --> 02:20:45.76
arriving in England on 9th July 1945 I reported to the holding battalion of the Hampshire

1272
02:20:45.76 --> 02:20:54.000
Regiment at Westgate on sea and was immediately sent on 28 days leave after night out in London with

1273
02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:02.24
three friends also berm a bound I telephone my parents and found them away

1274
02:21:02.80 --> 02:21:09.76
caught a train from waterloo and went to see them staying at the same hotel as my parents were

1275
02:21:10.64 --> 02:21:16.72
flight lieutenant Jack weatherlies widow Peggy and their three-year-old daughter Anne

1276
02:21:17.52 --> 02:21:22.80
we're staying at the same hotel as his parents at once a bond of deep understanding and affection

1277
02:21:22.80 --> 02:21:32.96
developed between us in August and Adam Baum was dropped and so at a stroke my visit to Burma was

1278
02:21:32.96 --> 02:21:43.52
rendered pointless so two in my heart was a military career I soldiered on in Libya and Palestine

1279
02:21:43.52 --> 02:21:49.84
with the first battalion of my own regiment for two more interesting years and finally was demobilized

1280
02:21:49.84 --> 02:22:02.48
in May of 1947 within a week of leaving the army I attended a job interview the managing

1281
02:22:02.48 --> 02:22:08.16
director who saw me a pale and thin-lipped man was a business acquaintance of a relative

1282
02:22:09.92 --> 02:22:18.32
he eyed me coldly slowly and precisely from his desk he lifted a ruler which he rudely pointed

1283
02:22:18.32 --> 02:22:26.32
at my face I understand that you made a slight name for yourself in the war be that as it may

1284
02:22:26.32 --> 02:22:31.36
people like you Jerry should remember that while you have been galleventing around the world

1285
02:22:31.36 --> 02:22:38.48
most of my staff had remained loyal to the company if you can give me one valid reason why

1286
02:22:38.48 --> 02:22:49.28
should even consider you for any position I should be interested to hear it I nearly hit him now I

1287
02:22:49.28 --> 02:22:54.48
wish that I had quickly grabbing my hat no umbrella I rose and told him that if he was the last

1288
02:22:54.48 --> 02:23:02.08
man in the world I would rather starve than work for him with that I left my heart pounding

1289
02:23:02.08 --> 02:23:07.04
and a foul taste in my mouth I walked aimlessly through miles of streets wishing that I was

1290
02:23:07.04 --> 02:23:14.24
back on some battlefield with real men soldiers like 18 platoon

1291
02:23:17.84 --> 02:23:25.76
armistice day brings its problems pagan I would like to go to church we used to go but found

1292
02:23:25.76 --> 02:23:30.40
almost without exception a lack of perception and sensitivity amongst the clergy

1293
02:23:30.40 --> 02:23:40.48
we suffered one armistice day sir sermon devoted to the curates theory that war being a crime

1294
02:23:40.48 --> 02:23:49.36
against humanity all chivalry must therefore be hypocritical I wondered whether the German

1295
02:23:49.36 --> 02:23:58.32
stretcher bears and their wounded at sin drn would have agreed I took offense pagan I have a lot

1296
02:23:58.32 --> 02:24:08.24
to mourn she jack weatherly and I 18 pltunes dead perhaps it is expecting too much of anyone to

1297
02:24:08.24 --> 02:24:16.24
understand intense grief particularly that of an now aging platoon commander who had to lead some of his

1298
02:24:16.24 --> 02:24:29.76
men to their deaths we now spend armistice day quietly at home with our ghosts

1299
02:24:34.08 --> 02:24:40.24
memories abound during the night I made a habit of wandering around the platoon

1300
02:24:40.24 --> 02:24:47.92
position so that each of my soldiers could talk to me I learned a lot they talked about their families

1301
02:24:47.92 --> 02:24:54.40
and their future hopes I hardly had to contribute to those whispered conversations that some

1302
02:24:54.40 --> 02:24:58.64
times took place in the dead of night or in the cold gray light just before dawn

1303
02:25:01.68 --> 02:25:04.32
I think it may have helped my soldiers to have a confidant

1304
02:25:04.32 --> 02:25:11.44
invaluable experience of human nature I now treasure the memory

1305
02:25:16.08 --> 02:25:23.20
weapons also left memories the monotonous repetitive bursts of the brain the hysterical

1306
02:25:23.20 --> 02:25:30.64
shriek of the mg 42's for furious rate of fire and the lethal chatter of the stands and schmysers all

1307
02:25:30.64 --> 02:25:40.56
contribute all contributed to the cacophony of battle traceable it seared themselves into memory

1308
02:25:41.76 --> 02:25:52.000
fired from a distance the parable approached almost lazily until suddenly like a swarm of fiery

1309
02:25:52.000 --> 02:26:00.000
demons they accelerated directly past one's head with earspooling cracks I shall never forget the

1310
02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:06.80
brain splitting shockwave as mortar bombs detonated nor the rending of the atmosphere when a stick

1311
02:26:06.80 --> 02:26:14.80
of nebel war for bombs straddled one slit trench my memory is stocked with smells

1312
02:26:16.32 --> 02:26:21.76
the metallic stench of dead cattle and Normandy the punching odor of German prisoners and the

1313
02:26:21.76 --> 02:26:32.48
vial penetrating chemical smell from a newly plowed shell creator strange fleeting memories too

1314
02:26:34.72 --> 02:26:41.68
why in circumstance of great danger did the palms of my hands moisten making it difficult to grip the

1315
02:26:41.68 --> 02:26:49.36
butt of my pistol why on pitch black knights full of menace was it possible to discern enemy

1316
02:26:49.36 --> 02:26:55.28
movement by fixing my straining eyes slightly to its side it sounds foolish but I swear that it works

1317
02:26:57.04 --> 02:27:02.48
after 40 years I am sure I could still prime a 36 grenade in total darkness or load the

1318
02:27:02.48 --> 02:27:10.88
magazines of a cult automatic pistol I remember our dead

1319
02:27:10.88 --> 02:27:19.52
their souls departing they lay awkwardly like bundles of discarded clothing

1320
02:27:21.12 --> 02:27:25.52
at bedberg lands corporal portius lay by their railway crossing

1321
02:27:27.44 --> 02:27:32.000
in an instant he had gone leaving his body clothing and equipment

1322
02:27:33.52 --> 02:27:34.000
empty

1323
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:43.60
at halvin boom private jones died with a tiny cry boston the chill winter air

1324
02:27:44.48 --> 02:27:46.08
as the bullet took him from us

1325
02:27:52.16 --> 02:27:53.76
memories are not all sad

1326
02:27:55.92 --> 02:28:00.24
rarely since as my adrenaline flowed as an advance to combat

1327
02:28:00.24 --> 02:28:08.24
with all the senses alert one lived for a few hours sometimes for day at a concert pitch

1328
02:28:10.48 --> 02:28:18.72
like a drug it captivated me I wanted more totally absorbed one pressed on until objectives had been

1329
02:28:18.72 --> 02:28:23.44
seized then I flopped as I had never done since

1330
02:28:23.44 --> 02:28:31.60
I remember the mood of pulsating expectancy during the last few hours before battle

1331
02:28:31.60 --> 02:28:37.12
old trusted friends like Dennis Clark and brandly handcock would arrive to tie up their artillery

1332
02:28:37.12 --> 02:28:43.04
support others troop commanders from the Sherwood Rangers would appear almost in party mood

1333
02:28:43.04 --> 02:28:49.44
demari up with us the very air was vibrant with excitement and good fellowship no

1334
02:28:49.44 --> 02:28:56.32
acrimony simply an exercise and willing cooperation to help us the infantry over come the day's grim

1335
02:28:56.32 --> 02:29:00.32
task

1336
02:29:02.24 --> 02:29:10.48
but my most treasured memory is the simple and sincere affection which existed between us all

1337
02:29:13.68 --> 02:29:17.92
based on mutual trust it was the cornerstone of the platoon success

1338
02:29:17.92 --> 02:29:26.64
and it survives unchanged to this day this is changed with regret regret because

1339
02:29:26.64 --> 02:29:31.60
Jim Kingston owned cheeseman and particularly Doug Proctor did not receive any

1340
02:29:31.60 --> 02:29:33.92
recognition they so richly deserved

1341
02:29:36.08 --> 02:29:40.72
Jim and Owen were mentioned dispatches but Doug was left unrewarded

1342
02:29:42.88 --> 02:29:47.76
over the years this omission has troubled me particularly because I had not been

1343
02:29:47.76 --> 02:29:54.000
so had I not been so young and inexperienced more notice might have been taken of my representations

1344
02:29:55.84 --> 02:30:01.20
I have no doubt that they all learned a military metal on more than one occasion and I their

1345
02:30:01.20 --> 02:30:04.48
platoon commander failed them in this respect

1346
02:30:04.48 --> 02:30:16.56
I miss my soldiers the warmth of their presence comforted me and their humor restored my spirits

1347
02:30:19.36 --> 02:30:26.32
in the brutal world of infantry warfare although few of them realized it and certainly none would admit it

1348
02:30:26.32 --> 02:30:37.60
their behavior was noble their absence left avoid which but for an exceptionally happy marriage

1349
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:45.20
would have certainly drawn me back into the army for the comfort that only a soldier can

1350
02:30:45.20 --> 02:30:57.44
understand strangely I have never since considered myself anything but a soldier

1351
02:30:57.44 --> 02:31:27.36
and that wraps up that book and I'm not sure if I have much

1352
02:31:27.36 --> 02:31:29.36
to add because

1353
02:31:37.44 --> 02:31:40.72
because Sidney Jerry seems to capture it

1354
02:31:44.80 --> 02:31:46.80
and so much of what he talks about

1355
02:31:49.44 --> 02:31:50.48
explains

1356
02:31:50.48 --> 02:32:00.88
so much not only about about being a soldier but also about what it's like

1357
02:32:02.56 --> 02:32:10.000
when a soldier is no longer a soldier to

1358
02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:19.60
to miss the adrenaline to miss that singular focus

1359
02:32:19.60 --> 02:32:34.64
to miss seeing men at their best at their noblest

1360
02:32:40.80 --> 02:32:43.76
to miss the men themselves

1361
02:32:43.76 --> 02:32:52.88
your comrades your friends your brothers

1362
02:32:54.96 --> 02:33:05.36
to miss what he calls so perfectly that simple and sincere affection that exists in a platoon

1363
02:33:05.36 --> 02:33:16.000
in affection that I'm not sure exists anywhere else

1364
02:33:19.12 --> 02:33:22.88
and you you hear me talk about when I start talking about a seal platoon

1365
02:33:25.76 --> 02:33:29.68
about how that's the best thing in the world and Sidney Jerry captures it

1366
02:33:29.68 --> 02:33:38.32
better than me you miss the mission and you miss the men

1367
02:33:40.88 --> 02:33:47.04
and of course you miss the fallen

1368
02:33:47.04 --> 02:33:55.52
as the British call them the glorious dead

1369
02:34:02.48 --> 02:34:07.12
and you wonder what would have become of them

1370
02:34:07.12 --> 02:34:14.48
where would they be now

1371
02:34:20.48 --> 02:34:22.88
and you you wonder why

1372
02:34:27.04 --> 02:34:27.60
why them

1373
02:34:27.60 --> 02:34:33.76
why was it them

1374
02:34:40.40 --> 02:34:42.16
and you know I talk about

1375
02:34:45.36 --> 02:34:49.28
the gift right the gift that they gave us

1376
02:34:49.28 --> 02:34:57.84
that the fallen have given us this gift of freedom and this gift of life but there's

1377
02:34:58.88 --> 02:35:04.24
there's more

1378
02:35:04.24 --> 02:35:08.32
there's more

1379
02:35:08.96 --> 02:35:11.28
because you see

1380
02:35:13.76 --> 02:35:16.96
the rest of us

1381
02:35:16.96 --> 02:35:18.96
we grow old

1382
02:35:23.60 --> 02:35:26.000
from time passes us by

1383
02:35:31.04 --> 02:35:36.40
and that that simple and sincere affection that Sidney Jerry describes

1384
02:35:39.76 --> 02:35:40.48
it changes

1385
02:35:40.48 --> 02:35:46.48
as we change

1386
02:35:47.92 --> 02:35:49.92
it ages

1387
02:35:52.72 --> 02:35:54.72
as we age

1388
02:35:58.24 --> 02:36:02.56
but the fallen do not change

1389
02:36:04.72 --> 02:36:10.000
the fallen do not age time has no effect on them

1390
02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
they remain

1391
02:36:15.44 --> 02:36:22.24
they remain young and bold and brave and uncomfortable

1392
02:36:30.32 --> 02:36:32.80
and so we remember them

1393
02:36:34.32 --> 02:36:34.80
that way

1394
02:36:34.80 --> 02:36:41.52
as they were and as they will always be

1395
02:36:49.28 --> 02:36:51.28
are heroes

1396
02:36:55.84 --> 02:37:00.88
heroes who walk no more and yet walk everywhere with us

1397
02:37:00.88 --> 02:37:07.92
who smile no more and yet they never stop smiling

1398
02:37:12.16 --> 02:37:16.56
heroes who live no more yet never stop living

1399
02:37:16.56 --> 02:37:35.92
are friends who shine no more and yet never stop shining

1400
02:37:35.92 --> 02:37:47.60
and that is the other gift that they give us

1401
02:37:54.32 --> 02:37:56.32
the fortune

1402
02:37:56.32 --> 02:38:06.16
to panic

1403
02:38:08.48 --> 02:38:12.80
and remember

1404
02:38:12.80 --> 02:38:28.08
I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1405
02:38:28.08 --> 02:38:56.40
So echo, maybe if you could talk about something else for a little while.

1406
02:38:56.40 --> 02:39:00.000
Yeah, I would appreciate it.

1407
02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:10.20
A part that stood out and we talked about this before, where the Germans were attacking

1408
02:39:10.20 --> 02:39:12.92
150 yards away.

1409
02:39:12.92 --> 02:39:16.36
They just get mowed down, they just keep killed.

1410
02:39:16.36 --> 02:39:19.84
The red flag comes up.

1411
02:39:19.84 --> 02:39:21.48
Structures come out.

1412
02:39:21.48 --> 02:39:26.08
Everyone sees fires, they're following the specific rules.

1413
02:39:26.08 --> 02:39:30.72
And then they collect the bodies and they salute.

1414
02:39:30.72 --> 02:39:34.64
We're good and then he salutes back.

1415
02:39:34.64 --> 02:39:35.64
Okay, solid.

1416
02:39:35.64 --> 02:39:40.08
No, game on, essentially game on now.

1417
02:39:40.08 --> 02:39:41.64
But this is like a war, though.

1418
02:39:41.64 --> 02:39:42.64
You know, it's different.

1419
02:39:42.64 --> 02:39:45.56
I mean, you kind of get that same feeling way on the lower level.

1420
02:39:45.56 --> 02:39:49.84
Obviously, but you're watching a UFC fight and then the round ends.

1421
02:39:49.84 --> 02:39:52.44
And then the guys kind of bump, bump, bump, like good round.

1422
02:39:52.44 --> 02:39:53.44
For sure.

1423
02:39:53.44 --> 02:39:58.000
So, well, two seconds ago, you guys were trying to knock the guy out, you know, just

1424
02:39:58.000 --> 02:39:59.44
like in this situation.

1425
02:39:59.44 --> 02:40:03.24
Two seconds ago, these guys were coming to kill you and you killed them, killed them.

1426
02:40:03.24 --> 02:40:04.24
Yeah.

1427
02:40:04.24 --> 02:40:12.28
Boom, it happened round over, you know, let's essentially continue following the rules.

1428
02:40:12.28 --> 02:40:16.56
And it's weird because it's less about the rules and more about like the respect, you

1429
02:40:16.56 --> 02:40:17.56
know?

1430
02:40:17.56 --> 02:40:18.56
It is.

1431
02:40:18.56 --> 02:40:23.36
And on top of that, you can pile on the fact that when they were in a hole in

1432
02:40:23.36 --> 02:40:29.96
woods, the Germans had booby trapped the British body, so they were just laying there.

1433
02:40:29.96 --> 02:40:33.72
They didn't get the same respect back.

1434
02:40:33.72 --> 02:40:39.08
But I think that's one thing that Sydney Jerry is very intent on throughout the book

1435
02:40:39.08 --> 02:40:48.12
is that regardless of how depraved the enemy acts, they are going to take the high road.

1436
02:40:48.12 --> 02:40:52.32
And you know, I think that's why this book is, this book, they give this book to everyone

1437
02:40:52.32 --> 02:40:57.16
at Sanhurst, which is the British military academy.

1438
02:40:57.16 --> 02:40:58.16
They give us everyone.

1439
02:40:58.16 --> 02:41:03.96
I mean, that's a great reason why because he sets a standard with his troops and they hold

1440
02:41:03.96 --> 02:41:08.40
that standard through regardless of the way the enemy behaves.

1441
02:41:08.40 --> 02:41:11.08
They don't lower themselves to that behavior.

1442
02:41:11.08 --> 02:41:16.12
You know, the worst atrocity that gets committed by his soldiers is when they spank

1443
02:41:16.12 --> 02:41:18.56
a waffen SS guy on the ass.

1444
02:41:18.56 --> 02:41:19.56
Yeah.

1445
02:41:19.56 --> 02:41:24.04
That's why this book is so powerful.

1446
02:41:24.04 --> 02:41:28.68
And you know, there's a lot of the book is very, it's very, you know, there's stuff

1447
02:41:28.68 --> 02:41:34.28
in there that you just aren't ready for, right?

1448
02:41:34.28 --> 02:41:37.88
Even when he was talking about the traits that someone should have.

1449
02:41:37.88 --> 02:41:43.16
And you know, when you start thinking about it, he's right.

1450
02:41:43.16 --> 02:41:44.16
He's right.

1451
02:41:44.16 --> 02:41:48.84
And if you had the choice between getting some meat head that was going to go do your

1452
02:41:48.84 --> 02:41:50.92
bidding, even though he might look like a big beast.

1453
02:41:50.92 --> 02:41:53.92
And he's going to, but then if you think about how's that guy going to act?

1454
02:41:53.92 --> 02:41:58.12
When things get tough or when things become ethically challenging.

1455
02:41:58.12 --> 02:41:59.12
Yeah.

1456
02:41:59.12 --> 02:42:00.72
How's that person going to act?

1457
02:42:00.72 --> 02:42:09.04
So these are, and it's, and I love the fact also that man, he's killing people.

1458
02:42:09.04 --> 02:42:13.72
He's lead, you know, it's easy to get caught up in the fact that he's wearing Corbura

1459
02:42:13.72 --> 02:42:14.92
Pants and he's got this.

1460
02:42:14.92 --> 02:42:15.92
There's a part, there's another part.

1461
02:42:15.92 --> 02:42:26.80
And didn't go over in the podcast, but there's a group of German, there's like German, some

1462
02:42:26.80 --> 02:42:30.24
kind of artillery piece and an artillery team.

1463
02:42:30.24 --> 02:42:34.84
And they're getting, the, the brits are getting their guns dialed in to the team.

1464
02:42:34.84 --> 02:42:36.60
And they're going to start killing them.

1465
02:42:36.60 --> 02:42:38.80
And they make a run for it.

1466
02:42:38.80 --> 02:42:39.80
And they have horses.

1467
02:42:39.80 --> 02:42:44.88
And there's like six guys and some horses towing this, this artillery piece away.

1468
02:42:44.88 --> 02:42:47.32
And the city Jerry feels happy.

1469
02:42:47.32 --> 02:42:50.48
He's happy that the, he's especially happy the horses, like, you know, he doesn't like

1470
02:42:50.48 --> 02:42:54.96
seeing the, the, the animals get killed.

1471
02:42:54.96 --> 02:42:58.68
And so he's actually happy that these guys escape.

1472
02:42:58.68 --> 02:43:02.24
And then he just says, you know, well, that's wrong because these guys have been come back

1473
02:43:02.24 --> 02:43:04.36
and killed my soldiers.

1474
02:43:04.36 --> 02:43:13.44
So he does a, you can see how hard it is for someone to be in these situations where

1475
02:43:13.44 --> 02:43:16.52
you have the good conscience, which wants to do the right thing.

1476
02:43:16.52 --> 02:43:19.36
And at the same time, you got to kill people.

1477
02:43:19.36 --> 02:43:20.56
Yeah.

1478
02:43:20.56 --> 02:43:23.52
And that's what makes combat so hard.

1479
02:43:23.52 --> 02:43:24.52
Yeah.

1480
02:43:24.52 --> 02:43:29.52
And he didn't, can he get to thinking about, remember the Christmas, the Christmas.

1481
02:43:29.52 --> 02:43:30.52
Christmas.

1482
02:43:30.52 --> 02:43:31.52
Yeah.

1483
02:43:31.52 --> 02:43:32.52
Yeah.

1484
02:43:32.52 --> 02:43:33.52
Yeah.

1485
02:43:33.52 --> 02:43:34.52
Christmas.

1486
02:43:34.52 --> 02:43:35.52
Yeah.

1487
02:43:35.52 --> 02:43:37.52
Where the Germans, the Germans kind of in that situation, they initiated that, right?

1488
02:43:37.52 --> 02:43:40.000
They were, like, cause like a mutual initiation.

1489
02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:43.92
But yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, if you remember that particular story, but I think overall it

1490
02:43:43.92 --> 02:43:47.20
was almost like a mutual initiation, but yes, in that particular story, there was sort of a

1491
02:43:47.20 --> 02:43:48.56
voice that says, hey, yeah, okay.

1492
02:43:48.56 --> 02:43:50.52
I don't cheat you, whatever.

1493
02:43:50.52 --> 02:43:57.000
And yeah, man, it's just crazy how that can kind of emerge from these situations where

1494
02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:01.04
guys are just straight up getting blown to pieces on purpose, by the way.

1495
02:44:01.04 --> 02:44:03.08
Not, you know, not like some tragic accident.

1496
02:44:03.08 --> 02:44:04.56
Like, this is that's the intent.

1497
02:44:04.56 --> 02:44:06.92
That's the intention.

1498
02:44:06.92 --> 02:44:11.36
And then they want to just stop and sing together, please soccer.

1499
02:44:11.36 --> 02:44:15.000
And then the next day, by the way, they're going back to killing each other on mass.

1500
02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Yeah.

1501
02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Dang.

1502
02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:23.56
Yeah, that's the thing about, you know, the, you know, this, a book like this is so

1503
02:44:23.56 --> 02:44:28.56
revealing of human nature, because business people have to do the same thing.

1504
02:44:28.56 --> 02:44:29.56
Yeah.

1505
02:44:29.56 --> 02:44:34.68
You know, if you're a business person and your business is losing money, well, guess what

1506
02:44:34.68 --> 02:44:36.60
you might have to do, cut staff.

1507
02:44:36.60 --> 02:44:40.68
So if you got to, and you, you know, we, let's say we're working with a small business

1508
02:44:40.68 --> 02:44:42.40
or you're, you've got a small business.

1509
02:44:42.40 --> 02:44:43.40
You've got 20 people.

1510
02:44:43.40 --> 02:44:44.88
You know all those 20 people.

1511
02:44:44.88 --> 02:44:45.88
Yeah.

1512
02:44:45.88 --> 02:44:48.68
But it's not like a nameless person that you're firing.

1513
02:44:48.68 --> 02:44:53.52
When you let go for five people, because you need to save money next quarter, you're

1514
02:44:53.52 --> 02:44:54.92
going to lose your building.

1515
02:44:54.92 --> 02:44:55.92
Yeah.

1516
02:44:55.92 --> 02:44:56.92
Guess what?

1517
02:44:56.92 --> 02:44:57.92
You're going to know those people.

1518
02:44:57.92 --> 02:44:58.92
Yeah.

1519
02:44:58.92 --> 02:45:04.52
And so it's the same dichotomy where this boss who wants to take care of his people, just

1520
02:45:04.52 --> 02:45:08.48
like Sydney Jerry wants to take care of his men and all of a sudden the only way to do

1521
02:45:08.48 --> 02:45:11.72
your mission is you've got to, you've got to get some of these people killed, or you're

1522
02:45:11.72 --> 02:45:13.04
going to fire some of these people.

1523
02:45:13.04 --> 02:45:14.48
Otherwise our plant shuts down.

1524
02:45:14.48 --> 02:45:17.12
Otherwise we can't go forward and everyone dies.

1525
02:45:17.12 --> 02:45:18.68
No one has a job now.

1526
02:45:18.68 --> 02:45:25.68
So the similarities, again, that's why it's, that's why these things about war reveal so much

1527
02:45:25.68 --> 02:45:30.28
about human nature, which is really what this podcast is about, is about human nature.

1528
02:45:30.28 --> 02:45:33.16
And the better you understand human nature, there's two things that can happen.

1529
02:45:33.16 --> 02:45:38.44
Number one, the better you can lead other people, but equally as important, if not more

1530
02:45:38.44 --> 02:45:42.68
important, is if you understand human nature, you can understand yourself.

1531
02:45:42.68 --> 02:45:43.68
Yeah.

1532
02:45:43.68 --> 02:45:44.92
You can understand the decisions that you make.

1533
02:45:44.92 --> 02:45:46.84
You can understand why something's bothering you.

1534
02:45:46.84 --> 02:45:54.000
You can understand what you need to conclude so that you can move forward in the best possible

1535
02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:55.000
way.

1536
02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:59.12
And if you don't understand human nature, you're, you're, in that, that's understanding

1537
02:45:59.12 --> 02:46:00.12
yourself.

1538
02:46:00.12 --> 02:46:01.12
Yeah.

1539
02:46:01.12 --> 02:46:05.20
And these books allow you to gather and garner so much of that.

1540
02:46:05.20 --> 02:46:06.20
Yeah.

1541
02:46:06.20 --> 02:46:07.20
Yeah.

1542
02:46:07.20 --> 02:46:08.20
Especially all the similarities.

1543
02:46:08.20 --> 02:46:09.20
So many.

1544
02:46:09.20 --> 02:46:11.20
All the time.

1545
02:46:11.20 --> 02:46:15.84
I remember in, just not junior high.

1546
02:46:15.84 --> 02:46:17.64
Yeah, I was junior high.

1547
02:46:17.64 --> 02:46:19.84
Um, maybe early high school.

1548
02:46:19.84 --> 02:46:25.000
So when I used to play pop Warner football, where my best friend played for a different

1549
02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:26.000
team.

1550
02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.04
But we're all, you know, it's in pop Warner.

1551
02:46:28.04 --> 02:46:32.08
It's different.

1552
02:46:32.08 --> 02:46:33.08
It's not by school.

1553
02:46:33.08 --> 02:46:36.08
It's by like, Regent, you know, like, an up region.

1554
02:46:36.08 --> 02:46:37.08
I guess town.

1555
02:46:37.08 --> 02:46:38.08
I'm going to go in.

1556
02:46:38.08 --> 02:46:39.08
I don't think.

1557
02:46:39.08 --> 02:46:41.92
Anyway, so the, you know, my best friend at the time, his name was Byron.

1558
02:46:41.92 --> 02:46:44.68
He, uh, who became a pilot, by the way.

1559
02:46:44.68 --> 02:46:45.68
I think it's the arms.

1560
02:46:45.68 --> 02:46:46.68
Yeah, I'm here.

1561
02:46:46.68 --> 02:46:47.68
I'm here.

1562
02:46:47.68 --> 02:46:48.68
I'm here.

1563
02:46:48.68 --> 02:46:49.68
I'm here.

1564
02:46:49.68 --> 02:46:51.80
Anyway, um, he played for a different team, but we were best friends.

1565
02:46:51.80 --> 02:46:55.08
So it was kind of that thing, you know, where your friends with the guys, but then,

1566
02:46:55.08 --> 02:46:58.000
you know, you go on the battlefield, you gather battling, you're back to friends.

1567
02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.36
Yeah, you're not killing them, though.

1568
02:47:00.36 --> 02:47:01.64
No way, different.

1569
02:47:01.64 --> 02:47:07.000
Yeah, uh, and there's, did you ever see that in Iraq, like, any of that, like, I don't

1570
02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.04
know, compassion, you know, yeah.

1571
02:47:09.04 --> 02:47:10.04
Yeah, for sure.

1572
02:47:10.04 --> 02:47:11.04
Even with the enemy type.

1573
02:47:11.04 --> 02:47:12.84
We're not not so much with the enemy type.

1574
02:47:12.84 --> 02:47:13.84
That's what I mean.

1575
02:47:13.84 --> 02:47:16.24
But with the civilian types, for sure.

1576
02:47:16.24 --> 02:47:21.56
I mean, I mean, obviously, and you'd see guys would go completely out of the way to try

1577
02:47:21.56 --> 02:47:23.80
and protect the civilian.

1578
02:47:23.80 --> 02:47:26.32
The enemy over there is a lot.

1579
02:47:26.32 --> 02:47:27.32
It's different.

1580
02:47:27.32 --> 02:47:32.24
Yeah, there's a, there's a, there's, you know, here you have a uniformed soldier.

1581
02:47:32.24 --> 02:47:33.24
Yeah.

1582
02:47:33.24 --> 02:47:34.80
You know, there you don't have a uniformed soldier.

1583
02:47:34.80 --> 02:47:39.24
You got somebody that's trying to sneak around and, and bully up the 90.

1584
02:47:39.24 --> 02:47:44.12
And yeah, you don't see that same level of now.

1585
02:47:44.12 --> 02:47:48.20
Uh, I mean, once you get a guy captured, that's it.

1586
02:47:48.20 --> 02:47:49.20
You know, okay.

1587
02:47:49.20 --> 02:47:50.20
We got him captured.

1588
02:47:50.20 --> 02:47:51.40
Zip them up, put him in the back of the home V.

1589
02:47:51.40 --> 02:47:53.40
I mean, that's it.

1590
02:47:53.40 --> 02:47:54.40
Yeah.

1591
02:47:54.40 --> 02:48:03.56
So you definitely, what what he talks about is this mutual respect of like look, we're

1592
02:48:03.56 --> 02:48:06.28
sitting in a slit trench getting murdered.

1593
02:48:06.28 --> 02:48:10.12
And when I, like when I meet you, you're on the other side, but I know that you've been

1594
02:48:10.12 --> 02:48:12.80
slitting him that sitting in a slit trench getting murdered all day.

1595
02:48:12.80 --> 02:48:13.80
Right.

1596
02:48:13.80 --> 02:48:15.60
That's why we have mutual respect for each other.

1597
02:48:15.60 --> 02:48:16.60
Yeah.

1598
02:48:16.60 --> 02:48:18.76
In Iraq, it's asymmetrical warfare.

1599
02:48:18.76 --> 02:48:23.36
So they're not suffering the same type of situation.

1600
02:48:23.36 --> 02:48:28.64
And they also, you know, one thing that really throws that stuff out the window is the

1601
02:48:28.64 --> 02:48:31.52
way that the insurgents treated the civilian populace.

1602
02:48:31.52 --> 02:48:32.52
Yeah.

1603
02:48:32.52 --> 02:48:40.16
So we're witnessing nonjudicial murders like when executions, we're seeing that.

1604
02:48:40.16 --> 02:48:42.48
We're seeing civilians getting tortured.

1605
02:48:42.48 --> 02:48:46.72
We're seeing, you know, people being beheaded.

1606
02:48:46.72 --> 02:48:49.40
And so when you see that, you're there trying to help these people.

1607
02:48:49.40 --> 02:48:56.16
And you start to think, look, if you're another infantryman in an opposing army, I can

1608
02:48:56.16 --> 02:48:57.80
I can empathize with you.

1609
02:48:57.80 --> 02:48:59.84
I can understand what you're going through.

1610
02:48:59.84 --> 02:49:06.12
But if you're, even if you're another army, but I see you raping torturing, murdering,

1611
02:49:06.12 --> 02:49:09.24
burning people alive, I don't empathize with you anymore.

1612
02:49:09.24 --> 02:49:11.16
It doesn't work that way.

1613
02:49:11.16 --> 02:49:13.36
So not really.

1614
02:49:13.36 --> 02:49:14.36
Yeah.

1615
02:49:14.36 --> 02:49:19.76
Now, you would get occasionally you'd get, like you could tell that someone would be mixed

1616
02:49:19.76 --> 02:49:22.04
up in something that they shouldn't have been mixed up in.

1617
02:49:22.04 --> 02:49:27.44
And maybe a young kid, you know, maybe a 17, 18 year old, because some of those kids,

1618
02:49:27.44 --> 02:49:36.000
some of the insurgents were not vehemently, you know, pro al-Qaeda.

1619
02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.92
Some of them were just, hey, look, I'm going to get paid 50 bucks to put an ID in the

1620
02:49:39.92 --> 02:49:40.92
road.

1621
02:49:40.92 --> 02:49:46.68
Yeah. And if you paid me 50 bucks to go and plant, you know, crop over there, I just

1622
02:49:46.68 --> 02:49:47.68
assumed to do that.

1623
02:49:47.68 --> 02:49:48.68
Yeah.

1624
02:49:48.68 --> 02:49:49.68
So you'd see some of that.

1625
02:49:49.68 --> 02:49:53.16
There'd be, okay, look, this kid's just, you know, he'd just caught up in something

1626
02:49:53.16 --> 02:49:54.16
doesn't understand.

1627
02:49:54.16 --> 02:49:59.56
And then again, I mean, all, again, the dichotomy is if you're putting an ID in the

1628
02:49:59.56 --> 02:50:01.80
road to kill Americans, but I don't care about you.

1629
02:50:01.80 --> 02:50:05.40
And I want to kill you.

1630
02:50:05.40 --> 02:50:06.68
That's all there is to that.

1631
02:50:06.68 --> 02:50:13.68
And, but it's definitely a different scenario when the people that you're fighting are,

1632
02:50:13.68 --> 02:50:17.24
are the ones that are committing these kinds of atrocities.

1633
02:50:17.24 --> 02:50:21.24
Because even as these guys, you know, they, you see how he differentiated between, like,

1634
02:50:21.24 --> 02:50:26.92
the Waffen SS and like a normal infantry group, he differentiates those two.

1635
02:50:26.92 --> 02:50:31.88
That'd be like if, let's say, the war in Iraq was against, let's say, Al Qaeda had taken

1636
02:50:31.88 --> 02:50:37.08
over Iraq and you were fighting, given the hardened al Qaeda guys or some normal infantry

1637
02:50:37.08 --> 02:50:38.08
men from the Iraqi army.

1638
02:50:38.08 --> 02:50:43.32
Yeah, those guys, you'd been like, hey, look, this dude's surrender to, okay, the al Qaeda

1639
02:50:43.32 --> 02:50:46.28
guys, first of all, they're probably not going to surrender.

1640
02:50:46.28 --> 02:50:51.52
And if they do, that's, they're going to not get the same treatment that a guy that's

1641
02:50:51.52 --> 02:50:53.84
a victim of circumstance, right?

1642
02:50:53.84 --> 02:50:56.92
A lot of the Germans, they're victim of circumstance.

1643
02:50:56.92 --> 02:50:59.12
Hey, that, this guy came into power.

1644
02:50:59.12 --> 02:51:00.12
I was a soldier.

1645
02:51:00.12 --> 02:51:01.12
I'm still a soldier.

1646
02:51:01.12 --> 02:51:07.04
You know, and, man, it's heavy.

1647
02:51:07.04 --> 02:51:08.68
It is.

1648
02:51:08.68 --> 02:51:16.08
But there is definitely a mutual respect that you have for another servicemen that's, you

1649
02:51:16.08 --> 02:51:18.88
know, has been through the same kind of crap that you've been through.

1650
02:51:18.88 --> 02:51:19.88
Yeah.

1651
02:51:19.88 --> 02:51:22.20
Yeah, man, make sense.

1652
02:51:22.20 --> 02:51:26.96
So with that, speaking of heavy, lifting kettlebells.

1653
02:51:26.96 --> 02:51:32.84
Anyway, I feel like we should talk about on it on a great kettlebells.

1654
02:51:32.84 --> 02:51:36.92
Again, I do feel spoiled, even every time I pick a month, even though they're dope, you

1655
02:51:36.92 --> 02:51:41.20
know, the artistic ones, should we call them artistic?

1656
02:51:41.20 --> 02:51:42.20
No.

1657
02:51:42.20 --> 02:51:43.20
Because they have names, right?

1658
02:51:43.20 --> 02:51:44.20
Primal bells.

1659
02:51:44.20 --> 02:51:46.92
Yeah, just called that better than or legend bells.

1660
02:51:46.92 --> 02:51:51.80
All that stuff, you know, I feel kind of spoiled because they're kind of like the designer

1661
02:51:51.80 --> 02:51:52.80
ones.

1662
02:51:52.80 --> 02:51:55.28
They're designer-ish, balanced by the way.

1663
02:51:55.28 --> 02:51:59.84
You know, we got into that.

1664
02:51:59.84 --> 02:52:05.000
Here's the thing about the guy, and I said this before, starting light with kettlebells.

1665
02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:06.56
It's critical.

1666
02:52:06.56 --> 02:52:07.56
My friend Anthony came over.

1667
02:52:07.56 --> 02:52:09.56
I don't know if you remember Anthony.

1668
02:52:09.56 --> 02:52:10.56
No.

1669
02:52:10.56 --> 02:52:13.60
The first day we recorded he was at my house.

1670
02:52:13.60 --> 02:52:14.60
Oh, yeah.

1671
02:52:14.60 --> 02:52:15.60
Yeah.

1672
02:52:15.60 --> 02:52:18.68
So he came over the other day and he was like, yeah, let's lift and, you know, last

1673
02:52:18.68 --> 02:52:20.72
time I seen him, I wasn't so much into the kettlebells.

1674
02:52:20.72 --> 02:52:22.44
So I was like, all right, we're doing this thing.

1675
02:52:22.44 --> 02:52:23.44
Be careful.

1676
02:52:23.44 --> 02:52:24.44
And I saw him.

1677
02:52:24.44 --> 02:52:25.44
He never done it.

1678
02:52:25.44 --> 02:52:26.44
Did you hurt him?

1679
02:52:26.44 --> 02:52:27.44
No, but-

1680
02:52:27.44 --> 02:52:31.20
Oh, he just he grabbed the lightest one and, you know, I said, start light or whatever.

1681
02:52:31.20 --> 02:52:35.76
And you could tell his, I'm gonna say this with all due respect if you haven't done

1682
02:52:35.76 --> 02:52:37.24
it before.

1683
02:52:37.24 --> 02:52:38.24
It makes sense.

1684
02:52:38.24 --> 02:52:41.000
But like his form was way off and I'm thinking bro, you're gonna get hurt.

1685
02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:42.000
Yeah.

1686
02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:43.000
You know?

1687
02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:44.000
Yeah.

1688
02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:47.60
So I was gonna go into like what crazy workout I did, but I'll save that for another

1689
02:52:47.60 --> 02:52:48.60
time.

1690
02:52:48.60 --> 02:52:49.60
For now.

1691
02:52:49.60 --> 02:52:50.60
We're almost at three hours right now.

1692
02:52:50.60 --> 02:52:51.60
For now.

1693
02:52:51.60 --> 02:52:52.60
I just looked at my watch.

1694
02:52:52.60 --> 02:52:53.60
253.

1695
02:52:53.60 --> 02:52:56.000
That's not a good sign.

1696
02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:00.04
So I apologize to everyone in the world for doing a three and a half hour podcast,

1697
02:53:00.04 --> 02:53:03.60
which is gonna turn into a faculty who describes his last 14 workouts.

1698
02:53:03.60 --> 02:53:05.60
Four and a half hours.

1699
02:53:05.60 --> 02:53:06.60
Great detail.

1700
02:53:06.60 --> 02:53:10.44
Nonetheless, so we'll, uh, create a real quick.

1701
02:53:10.44 --> 02:53:13.04
I was talking to somebody at the mustard.

1702
02:53:13.04 --> 02:53:15.60
I think he was, I forget who it was.

1703
02:53:15.60 --> 02:53:17.92
Nonetheless, we was talking about the benefits yet again.

1704
02:53:17.92 --> 02:53:19.32
This is like a common thing.

1705
02:53:19.32 --> 02:53:20.32
It's true.

1706
02:53:20.32 --> 02:53:22.52
I don't exaggerate about the cruel oil.

1707
02:53:22.52 --> 02:53:25.28
It's something like I can't go back to not taking cruel oil.

1708
02:53:25.28 --> 02:53:26.28
No, take the cruel oil.

1709
02:53:26.28 --> 02:53:27.28
And I don't mind.

1710
02:53:27.28 --> 02:53:29.72
Oh, actually, we were talking to the left.

1711
02:53:29.72 --> 02:53:31.84
Remember the life city you ran out of cruel oil?

1712
02:53:31.84 --> 02:53:33.88
Yeah, and he's all mad at me because he gave me some.

1713
02:53:33.88 --> 02:53:35.04
Oh, you're kidding.

1714
02:53:35.04 --> 02:53:36.04
I didn't bring any.

1715
02:53:36.04 --> 02:53:39.88
Yeah, actually technically technically was a channel that he brought me some.

1716
02:53:39.88 --> 02:53:40.88
I think he just gave you one.

1717
02:53:40.88 --> 02:53:41.88
None the less.

1718
02:53:41.88 --> 02:53:42.88
He gave me one.

1719
02:53:42.88 --> 02:53:45.000
Yeah, so I guess he can have a part of it.

1720
02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:45.84
Got the credit.

1721
02:53:45.84 --> 02:53:46.68
Nope.

1722
02:53:46.68 --> 02:53:49.000
Nonetheless, I'll never go back to no cruel oil.

1723
02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:50.32
So where would you get it?

1724
02:53:50.32 --> 02:53:51.84
On it, cruel oil.

1725
02:53:51.84 --> 02:53:53.84
What if you wanted to save money?

1726
02:53:53.84 --> 02:53:55.88
Go on it.com slash chocolate.

1727
02:53:55.88 --> 02:53:57.64
There's a lot of things on there.

1728
02:53:57.64 --> 02:54:03.80
And on it is one of those good companies slash website where anything you need, like

1729
02:54:03.80 --> 02:54:08.76
anything you need supplementation with, all the way down to workouts.

1730
02:54:08.76 --> 02:54:10.68
They got it on there.

1731
02:54:10.68 --> 02:54:14.08
Try your best not to get too addicted to the website because it's very fast.

1732
02:54:14.08 --> 02:54:15.08
Very really funny.

1733
02:54:15.08 --> 02:54:16.08
First, and that has that issue.

1734
02:54:16.08 --> 02:54:17.08
I don't think so.

1735
02:54:17.08 --> 02:54:21.80
I will guarantee you all spend time watching the videos and stuff.

1736
02:54:21.80 --> 02:54:24.92
Browsing the products.

1737
02:54:24.92 --> 02:54:28.72
Sometimes you can get like, we talked about the, you know, how you get on Amazon.

1738
02:54:28.72 --> 02:54:30.64
And you're like, yeah, I want to get that thing too.

1739
02:54:30.64 --> 02:54:31.80
You don't really need it.

1740
02:54:31.80 --> 02:54:32.80
Just look super cool.

1741
02:54:32.80 --> 02:54:33.80
It's one of those.

1742
02:54:33.80 --> 02:54:34.80
Amazon does that.

1743
02:54:34.80 --> 02:54:36.28
Yeah, so be careful.

1744
02:54:36.28 --> 02:54:37.28
It does.

1745
02:54:37.28 --> 02:54:38.64
But I don't think it like prompts you.

1746
02:54:38.64 --> 02:54:40.64
It's just the list of stuff is all cool.

1747
02:54:40.64 --> 02:54:42.28
You know, it's not just a kettlebell.

1748
02:54:42.28 --> 02:54:43.80
It's the really cool one.

1749
02:54:43.80 --> 02:54:45.80
You know, so it's that situation.

1750
02:54:45.80 --> 02:54:49.56
Anyway, on it.com slash chocolate, if you want the 10% off.

1751
02:54:49.56 --> 02:54:51.24
And yeah, report back.

1752
02:54:51.24 --> 02:54:52.76
I mean, what you think?

1753
02:54:52.76 --> 02:54:55.20
And if you ask me about the krill oil, right, I'll tell you.

1754
02:54:55.20 --> 02:54:56.68
I'll tell you till the end of time.

1755
02:54:56.68 --> 02:55:00.68
I will not take krill oil ever again.

1756
02:55:00.68 --> 02:55:02.40
If I have anything to say about it.

1757
02:55:02.40 --> 02:55:07.08
Another way to support is when you pick up your copy of 18

1758
02:55:07.08 --> 02:55:13.16
platoon or whichever books you choose that chocolate reads on this podcast.

1759
02:55:13.16 --> 02:55:17.000
Go on our website, jocabodcast.com, go to the book section on the top of this book

1760
02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:18.68
from episodes.

1761
02:55:18.68 --> 02:55:20.20
Click through there.

1762
02:55:20.20 --> 02:55:21.20
It's up.

1763
02:55:21.20 --> 02:55:26.000
If you're looking to get 18 platoon the book, you actually, you can get it on Amazon.

1764
02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:29.44
Used for like 40 bucks.

1765
02:55:29.44 --> 02:55:30.44
Used copy.

1766
02:55:30.44 --> 02:55:33.24
Which they'll all be gone by the time.

1767
02:55:33.24 --> 02:55:39.16
Whoever you are listening to this, you can also get it from a website.

1768
02:55:39.16 --> 02:55:44.56
Riflesdirect.com, which actually supports the rifles regimen in the UK.

1769
02:55:44.56 --> 02:55:47.96
So you can get it there as well.

1770
02:55:47.96 --> 02:55:54.44
Or you can buy the used hardcover copies from Amazon.com after you click through.

1771
02:55:54.44 --> 02:55:56.80
Yeah, click through there, boom.

1772
02:55:56.80 --> 02:56:01.68
And even if you're buying something else, hey, click through.

1773
02:56:01.68 --> 02:56:03.72
Support the cause anyway.

1774
02:56:03.72 --> 02:56:05.72
Another way.

1775
02:56:05.72 --> 02:56:13.08
Subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, and any other podcast providing

1776
02:56:13.08 --> 02:56:19.08
platforms also and not excluding YouTube.

1777
02:56:19.08 --> 02:56:20.32
YouTube's a good one.

1778
02:56:20.32 --> 02:56:21.32
Video version.

1779
02:56:21.32 --> 02:56:23.04
I got YouTube read by the way.

1780
02:56:23.04 --> 02:56:24.72
Okay, wait, wait, what's the benefit?

1781
02:56:24.72 --> 02:56:29.48
So the one of the benefits is on YouTube, Brad, you can listen to, even if you go to another

1782
02:56:29.48 --> 02:56:30.48
app, all right, yeah.

1783
02:56:30.48 --> 02:56:31.48
Right, yeah.

1784
02:56:31.48 --> 02:56:34.56
So it's a real, it's a real cool deal for me.

1785
02:56:34.56 --> 02:56:35.56
Yeah, I'm in.

1786
02:56:35.56 --> 02:56:37.56
It's real hands.

1787
02:56:37.56 --> 02:56:38.56
I like that.

1788
02:56:38.56 --> 02:56:39.56
Yeah, I know you do.

1789
02:56:39.56 --> 02:56:40.56
Good.

1790
02:56:40.56 --> 02:56:41.56
relevant.

1791
02:56:41.56 --> 02:56:42.56
Most of the time.

1792
02:56:42.56 --> 02:56:45.76
It's the same ad over and over and over and it gets, you know what, though, you

1793
02:56:45.76 --> 02:56:47.32
know when they play, you ever see the same.

1794
02:56:47.32 --> 02:56:48.88
Well, you don't see ads anymore.

1795
02:56:48.88 --> 02:56:54.32
No, but there's a lot of people who may or may not enjoy ads and or still have the only

1796
02:56:54.32 --> 02:56:55.32
person that enjoy ads.

1797
02:56:55.32 --> 02:56:56.32
You got this.

1798
02:56:56.32 --> 02:56:57.32
You got this.

1799
02:56:57.32 --> 02:57:01.48
You know, you know, how's it like here, for example.

1800
02:57:01.48 --> 02:57:03.20
So Thai Lopez, right?

1801
02:57:03.20 --> 02:57:04.20
That's not it.

1802
02:57:04.20 --> 02:57:05.20
I don't know.

1803
02:57:05.20 --> 02:57:07.44
They all have like, I had every single time.

1804
02:57:07.44 --> 02:57:08.44
Yeah, I know.

1805
02:57:08.44 --> 02:57:11.28
You know, there's this other financial company, which is a weird one, which is, it's

1806
02:57:11.28 --> 02:57:13.16
a really poorly done nonetheless.

1807
02:57:13.16 --> 02:57:17.08
So Thai Lopez, here's the example, Thai Lopez, he'll be like, they'll talk about some

1808
02:57:17.08 --> 02:57:18.08
stuff.

1809
02:57:18.08 --> 02:57:22.24
And then after it's the same ad over and over and after a while, you're like, okay, okay, skip

1810
02:57:22.24 --> 02:57:23.24
the ad.

1811
02:57:23.24 --> 02:57:26.64
But then it kind of sticks with you and then you're kind of like, yeah, that's called advertising.

1812
02:57:26.64 --> 02:57:27.64
I know.

1813
02:57:27.64 --> 02:57:28.64
I know that's what I mean.

1814
02:57:28.64 --> 02:57:31.08
Yeah, but it's kind of like, I see what's going on yet.

1815
02:57:31.08 --> 02:57:32.96
I still am compelled, you know?

1816
02:57:32.96 --> 02:57:35.36
So it's like, it's kind of like, it's beneficial almost.

1817
02:57:35.36 --> 02:57:36.76
I'm over here, not compelled.

1818
02:57:36.76 --> 02:57:37.76
It's not compelled.

1819
02:57:37.76 --> 02:57:38.76
No.

1820
02:57:38.76 --> 02:57:43.000
But I am compelled to subscribe to YouTube.

1821
02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:44.000
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1822
02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:45.000
There you go.

1823
02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:48.000
So you're trying to say, you're saying a lot of other stuff right now.

1824
02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:49.000
Well, you know, it's not helpful.

1825
02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.60
I'm going to these tangents and it's relevant.

1826
02:57:51.60 --> 02:57:56.000
I feel like people can relate on some level, sometimes.

1827
02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Maybe.

1828
02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Occasionally.

1829
02:57:58.000 --> 02:57:59.000
Weird people.

1830
02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.28
Nonetheless, YouTube, that's a good one.

1831
02:58:01.28 --> 02:58:02.28
Video version.

1832
02:58:02.28 --> 02:58:05.000
What's the, what's Jockel podcast is the channel?

1833
02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:06.000
Yeah.

1834
02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:07.000
To subscribe to.

1835
02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:08.000
Yeah.

1836
02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.36
It'd be cool if you put videos on there more often.

1837
02:58:10.36 --> 02:58:12.76
I do stuff like two, three a week.

1838
02:58:12.76 --> 02:58:14.44
Oh, yeah, two, three a week now.

1839
02:58:14.44 --> 02:58:15.44
Kind of.

1840
02:58:15.44 --> 02:58:16.44
Okay, good.

1841
02:58:16.44 --> 02:58:17.44
I'm looking forward to that new.

1842
02:58:17.44 --> 02:58:20.76
Whatever I put, I put one on the other, what is Monday?

1843
02:58:20.76 --> 02:58:22.44
Yeah, okay, that's one.

1844
02:58:22.44 --> 02:58:24.64
It's, it's whatever it is right now.

1845
02:58:24.64 --> 02:58:25.64
Yeah, man.

1846
02:58:25.64 --> 02:58:26.64
Thursday.

1847
02:58:26.64 --> 02:58:27.64
No worries.

1848
02:58:27.64 --> 02:58:28.64
I got you.

1849
02:58:28.64 --> 02:58:30.96
Go subscribe to that if you haven't already.

1850
02:58:30.96 --> 02:58:35.76
And you can get the video version and excerpts, which are shareable, shareable, meaning

1851
02:58:35.76 --> 02:58:37.16
they're just shorter.

1852
02:58:37.16 --> 02:58:38.16
They're shorter.

1853
02:58:38.16 --> 02:58:42.12
So, you know, whoever opens it, they're going to be, then more of a chance they're going

1854
02:58:42.12 --> 02:58:46.60
to listen to it when it's two, three minutes longer than two and a half, three and a half

1855
02:58:46.60 --> 02:58:49.92
in this case hours long.

1856
02:58:49.92 --> 02:58:50.92
That's just how.

1857
02:58:50.92 --> 02:58:53.80
That's not fired from doing podcasts because they're too long.

1858
02:58:53.80 --> 02:58:54.80
Is that possible?

1859
02:58:54.80 --> 02:58:55.80
Maybe.

1860
02:58:55.80 --> 02:58:57.80
I guess how they do it.

1861
02:58:57.80 --> 02:58:58.80
What else?

1862
02:58:58.80 --> 02:58:59.80
Anything is possible, right?

1863
02:58:59.80 --> 02:59:00.80
That's the thing.

1864
02:59:00.80 --> 02:59:01.80
What else?

1865
02:59:01.80 --> 02:59:02.80
Jockel has a store.

1866
02:59:02.80 --> 02:59:05.56
It's called Jockel Store.

1867
02:59:05.56 --> 02:59:07.56
It's a site jockelstore.com.

1868
02:59:07.56 --> 02:59:09.24
See, catchy, right?

1869
02:59:09.24 --> 02:59:10.96
Easy to remember.

1870
02:59:10.96 --> 02:59:13.44
If it's a store and it's jockels is jockel store.

1871
02:59:13.44 --> 02:59:16.52
If it's a podcast and it's jockels is jockel podcast.

1872
02:59:16.52 --> 02:59:19.04
If it's, you know, if it's key chains.

1873
02:59:19.04 --> 02:59:20.24
I was meeting some people.

1874
02:59:20.24 --> 02:59:21.24
Jockel key chains.

1875
02:59:21.24 --> 02:59:27.000
I was meeting some people talking to some people at a group the other day who are not familiar

1876
02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.68
with me or with anything.

1877
02:59:29.68 --> 02:59:31.68
Got to respect.

1878
02:59:31.68 --> 02:59:38.000
And they said, oh, well, do you, do you, or, you know, one of them said, oh, he's got a podcast.

1879
02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.32
And then the other one said, oh, what's the name of the podcast?

1880
02:59:40.32 --> 02:59:44.44
That's what all the podcasts he's called Jockel Podcast.

1881
02:59:44.44 --> 02:59:47.20
And she said, this one, cross it.

1882
02:59:47.20 --> 02:59:50.04
Did you pay your marketing team a lot for that?

1883
02:59:50.04 --> 02:59:51.04
Yeah.

1884
02:59:51.04 --> 02:59:53.48
And I said, yes, and the fact I did.

1885
02:59:53.48 --> 02:59:55.48
You know, exactly.

1886
02:59:55.48 --> 02:59:56.48
Real original like that.

1887
02:59:56.48 --> 02:59:57.48
Yep.

1888
02:59:57.48 --> 02:59:58.48
So original, but hey, man.

1889
02:59:58.48 --> 03:00:00.72
You know, could be worse.

1890
03:00:00.72 --> 03:00:03.08
So back to the store.

1891
03:00:03.08 --> 03:00:04.88
Jockel store, that is.

1892
03:00:04.88 --> 03:00:06.28
There's some t-shirts on there.

1893
03:00:06.28 --> 03:00:09.84
If you want to represent, you know, the t-shirts carry a message.

1894
03:00:09.84 --> 03:00:12.84
The message has layers.

1895
03:00:12.84 --> 03:00:16.52
Actually, I guess technically the shirts have layers because the message is one of the

1896
03:00:16.52 --> 03:00:17.52
layers of the shirt.

1897
03:00:17.52 --> 03:00:18.52
You know what I mean?

1898
03:00:18.52 --> 03:00:19.52
Anyway, go on there.

1899
03:00:19.52 --> 03:00:20.52
Jockelstore.com.

1900
03:00:20.52 --> 03:00:21.92
If you like something, get something.

1901
03:00:21.92 --> 03:00:22.92
That's a good way to start.

1902
03:00:22.92 --> 03:00:24.72
Our shirts coming out this week.

1903
03:00:24.72 --> 03:00:25.72
That's my question to you.

1904
03:00:25.72 --> 03:00:26.92
Yeah, that's the intention.

1905
03:00:26.92 --> 03:00:28.72
Okay, so I'm getting angry.

1906
03:00:28.72 --> 03:00:29.72
Yeah, I understand.

1907
03:00:29.72 --> 03:00:32.72
But you know, make me not get in your business.

1908
03:00:32.72 --> 03:00:33.72
Hey, normal face.

1909
03:00:33.72 --> 03:00:34.72
Normal face.

1910
03:00:34.72 --> 03:00:35.72
Normal face.

1911
03:00:35.72 --> 03:00:36.72
My face is way normal.

1912
03:00:36.72 --> 03:00:38.72
But don't make me come and get in your business and do your job for you.

1913
03:00:38.72 --> 03:00:42.72
Because if you've ever heard me talk on this podcast, I talk about when people don't do their job.

1914
03:00:42.72 --> 03:00:43.72
That's awesome.

1915
03:00:43.72 --> 03:00:44.72
Because then I can take their job from them.

1916
03:00:44.72 --> 03:00:45.72
Right, right.

1917
03:00:45.72 --> 03:00:46.72
You got to step down.

1918
03:00:46.72 --> 03:00:47.72
Think about where I'm more of my mindset is.

1919
03:00:47.72 --> 03:00:49.72
And you may want to step it up over on your end.

1920
03:00:49.72 --> 03:00:50.72
Oh, thank you.

1921
03:00:50.72 --> 03:00:51.72
But to jump into the store.

1922
03:00:51.72 --> 03:00:53.72
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1923
03:00:53.72 --> 03:00:54.72
No, no respect.

1924
03:00:54.72 --> 03:00:56.72
I did it.

1925
03:00:56.72 --> 03:00:57.72
And we're going to try to get that to do.

1926
03:00:57.72 --> 03:00:59.72
Yeah, let's try it for you.

1927
03:00:59.72 --> 03:01:01.72
No, let's do.

1928
03:01:01.72 --> 03:01:07.72
You know why you're saying this right now because you can't wait for the shirt that you designed to come up.

1929
03:01:07.72 --> 03:01:08.72
Because you want the recognition.

1930
03:01:08.72 --> 03:01:16.72
Well, I also think your I think you might be sabotaging and sabotaging my efforts.

1931
03:01:16.72 --> 03:01:18.72
I made the better shirt.

1932
03:01:18.72 --> 03:01:24.72
And you don't want to print it because your self-conscious.

1933
03:01:24.72 --> 03:01:26.72
And that's not going to stand.

1934
03:01:26.72 --> 03:01:30.72
Well, I will give you the respect because there is in fact layers to this shirt as well.

1935
03:01:30.72 --> 03:01:33.72
So all right, how about this more layers more layers.

1936
03:01:33.72 --> 03:01:35.72
Oh, yeah, yeah, you could be right.

1937
03:01:35.72 --> 03:01:38.72
I think you might have more layers than the standard.

1938
03:01:38.72 --> 03:01:40.72
I guess we'll see.

1939
03:01:40.72 --> 03:01:41.72
We're going to find out about that one.

1940
03:01:41.72 --> 03:01:42.72
Anyway, jockels.com.

1941
03:01:42.72 --> 03:01:43.72
So women's stuff on there as well.

1942
03:01:43.72 --> 03:01:47.72
Some patches, some rash guards, some cool rash guards.

1943
03:01:47.72 --> 03:01:48.72
Yeah.

1944
03:01:48.72 --> 03:01:49.72
Indeed.

1945
03:01:49.72 --> 03:01:50.72
Some huddies.

1946
03:01:50.72 --> 03:01:51.72
Other stuff.

1947
03:01:51.72 --> 03:01:52.72
Anyway, go on there.

1948
03:01:52.72 --> 03:01:53.72
Check it out.

1949
03:01:53.72 --> 03:01:54.72
If you want something, get something.

1950
03:01:54.72 --> 03:01:56.72
Also, psychological warfare.

1951
03:01:56.72 --> 03:01:58.72
If you're having trouble.

1952
03:01:58.72 --> 03:02:00.72
If you're having trouble.

1953
03:02:00.72 --> 03:02:07.72
If you're like me and sometimes you do or currently having trouble with not feeling like working out.

1954
03:02:07.72 --> 03:02:09.72
Not feeling like it.

1955
03:02:09.72 --> 03:02:16.72
So you're considering skipping the workout, waiting for tomorrow, making your workout day into a rest day.

1956
03:02:16.72 --> 03:02:18.72
If you're having that problem, this is what you do.

1957
03:02:18.72 --> 03:02:21.72
Psychological warfare search on iTunes.

1958
03:02:21.72 --> 03:02:22.72
Google Boy.

1959
03:02:22.72 --> 03:02:23.72
Amazon.

1960
03:02:23.72 --> 03:02:26.72
So anyway, where you can get MP3s, you search psychological warfare.

1961
03:02:26.72 --> 03:02:29.72
Jockel willink.

1962
03:02:29.72 --> 03:02:32.72
And it's an album.

1963
03:02:32.72 --> 03:02:33.72
Witcher.

1964
03:02:33.72 --> 03:02:39.72
And these tracks will help you through anything that you're feeling that weakness, like I just mentioned,

1965
03:02:39.72 --> 03:02:43.72
whether it be waking up early or skipping the workout or cheating on the diet.

1966
03:02:43.72 --> 03:02:45.72
And I say cheating on the diet.

1967
03:02:45.72 --> 03:02:48.72
Because you made a promise to yourself, you're not going to eat those donuts.

1968
03:02:48.72 --> 03:02:49.72
You made a promise.

1969
03:02:49.72 --> 03:02:51.72
And then now like all of us on all of them.

1970
03:02:51.72 --> 03:02:52.72
Eat the donuts.

1971
03:02:52.72 --> 03:02:54.72
No, that's not the promise you made.

1972
03:02:54.72 --> 03:02:56.72
Just think I can never eat a donut again.

1973
03:02:56.72 --> 03:02:57.72
No, sure.

1974
03:02:57.72 --> 03:02:58.72
Exactly right.

1975
03:02:58.72 --> 03:03:02.72
Because everyone in the world will, like, somewhat, be there with a camera.

1976
03:03:02.72 --> 03:03:03.72
Yeah.

1977
03:03:03.72 --> 03:03:05.72
And they'll get me a pop at the end.

1978
03:03:05.72 --> 03:03:06.72
Yeah, yeah, pop at the end.

1979
03:03:06.72 --> 03:03:11.72
And consider this, like, what if you knew 100% know once, you know, watch whatever.

1980
03:03:11.72 --> 03:03:12.72
And then you're eating the donut.

1981
03:03:12.72 --> 03:03:13.72
Can you imagine the guilt?

1982
03:03:13.72 --> 03:03:14.72
Yeah.

1983
03:03:14.72 --> 03:03:15.72
You're feeling like you're a guilt.

1984
03:03:15.72 --> 03:03:16.72
Yeah, you can do it.

1985
03:03:16.72 --> 03:03:17.72
You're done.

1986
03:03:17.72 --> 03:03:18.72
Don't let the time.

1987
03:03:18.72 --> 03:03:24.72
You know, but in the event of other people, not you do other people feeling that weakness.

1988
03:03:24.72 --> 03:03:25.72
There's a track for that.

1989
03:03:25.72 --> 03:03:31.72
Remember back when I phone kind of came out and there's that thing.

1990
03:03:31.72 --> 03:03:32.72
There's an app for that.

1991
03:03:32.72 --> 03:03:34.72
Remember that you always say that.

1992
03:03:34.72 --> 03:03:35.72
Oh, there's an app for that.

1993
03:03:35.72 --> 03:03:36.72
There's an app for that.

1994
03:03:36.72 --> 03:03:37.72
That was like an expression.

1995
03:03:37.72 --> 03:03:38.72
Okay.

1996
03:03:38.72 --> 03:03:40.72
Look, with this, there's a track for that.

1997
03:03:40.72 --> 03:03:43.72
You just made that up right now.

1998
03:03:43.72 --> 03:03:44.72
Anyway, psychological warfare.

1999
03:03:44.72 --> 03:03:45.72
You check it.

2000
03:03:45.72 --> 03:03:46.72
If you need that.

2001
03:03:46.72 --> 03:03:49.72
If you need that, that's spot.

2002
03:03:49.72 --> 03:03:50.72
Because really, that's what it is.

2003
03:03:50.72 --> 03:03:52.72
It's a spot in life.

2004
03:03:52.72 --> 03:03:55.72
When you're trying to live heavy things, it's good to have a spot.

2005
03:03:55.72 --> 03:03:58.72
If you're living light stuff or not lifting that all you need a spot.

2006
03:03:58.72 --> 03:04:00.72
So don't even worry about that.

2007
03:04:00.72 --> 03:04:01.72
If you're not doing nothing, don't even get this.

2008
03:04:01.72 --> 03:04:02.72
You don't even need it.

2009
03:04:02.72 --> 03:04:05.72
If you're not doing anything in life, don't get it.

2010
03:04:05.72 --> 03:04:06.72
You shouldn't say.

2011
03:04:06.72 --> 03:04:07.72
Yeah.

2012
03:04:07.72 --> 03:04:07.72
Let's try.

2013
03:04:07.72 --> 03:04:08.72
Let's try.

2014
03:04:08.72 --> 03:04:08.72
Get it.

2015
03:04:08.72 --> 03:04:09.72
Check.

2016
03:04:09.72 --> 03:04:10.72
All right.

2017
03:04:10.72 --> 03:04:11.72
Like I said, 18, we'll tune.

2018
03:04:11.72 --> 03:04:13.72
You can get that at riflesdirect.com from the UK.

2019
03:04:13.72 --> 03:04:15.72
It supports that regimen, which I'm all about.

2020
03:04:15.72 --> 03:04:20.72
Also, you know, speaking of rash guards and stuff, check out originmain.com.

2021
03:04:20.72 --> 03:04:26.72
My boy up there Pete Roberts, he's kind of a, he's kind of a psycho.

2022
03:04:26.72 --> 03:04:29.72
Actually, kind of a madman.

2023
03:04:29.72 --> 03:04:32.72
He's all about manufacturing in America, which I'm all about to.

2024
03:04:32.72 --> 03:04:37.72
And I'm going to go into this at some point, but like you wanted to make guise here.

2025
03:04:37.72 --> 03:04:38.72
And you couldn't get the fabric.

2026
03:04:38.72 --> 03:04:42.72
So he went out and bought old abandoned looms from abandoned factories.

2027
03:04:42.72 --> 03:04:48.72
And hired old timers that knew how to work these things and refer to them and rebuilt them.

2028
03:04:48.72 --> 03:04:53.72
And has made these looms brought them back to life so they can make guise and rash guards.

2029
03:04:53.72 --> 03:04:55.72
Here in America, in Maine.

2030
03:04:55.72 --> 03:05:02.72
And like I said, that's kind of crazy borderline psychopathic, which I kind of like.

2031
03:05:02.72 --> 03:05:08.72
And yeah, that's kind of why we're kind of working on joining forces in some way.

2032
03:05:08.72 --> 03:05:13.72
Pete origin, warpath.

2033
03:05:13.72 --> 03:05:15.72
It's going down.

2034
03:05:15.72 --> 03:05:16.72
We're going to make something happen.

2035
03:05:16.72 --> 03:05:20.72
I'll keep everyone informed as we finalize the plan.

2036
03:05:20.72 --> 03:05:22.72
That rash guard that you mentioned.

2037
03:05:22.72 --> 03:05:23.72
Yeah.

2038
03:05:23.72 --> 03:05:25.72
And posted the video.

2039
03:05:25.72 --> 03:05:26.72
Yeah.

2040
03:05:26.72 --> 03:05:27.72
That was a lot nicer.

2041
03:05:27.72 --> 03:05:30.72
Is a lot nicer in legit than I am.

2042
03:05:30.72 --> 03:05:32.72
Yes, when you see it, it's underplayed.

2043
03:05:32.72 --> 03:05:34.72
You're like, yeah, well, you didn't know.

2044
03:05:34.72 --> 03:05:37.72
I made it sound like just kind of cheesy.

2045
03:05:37.72 --> 03:05:38.72
Yeah, like you.

2046
03:05:38.72 --> 03:05:42.72
But you didn't realize it was actually savvy.

2047
03:05:42.72 --> 03:05:47.72
But the thing is that rash guard, it's already sold out.

2048
03:05:47.72 --> 03:05:53.72
You know, so now he's printing a bunch more, but he's got to weave the material.

2049
03:05:53.72 --> 03:05:54.72
Yeah, right?

2050
03:05:54.72 --> 03:05:57.72
Or he gets, he gets one of his producers here in America.

2051
03:05:57.72 --> 03:05:58.72
We submit to real so anyways.

2052
03:05:58.72 --> 03:06:03.72
Check out that origin main dot com growing company.

2053
03:06:03.72 --> 03:06:05.72
We're getting in league with them.

2054
03:06:05.72 --> 03:06:07.72
And we're getting a big time.

2055
03:06:07.72 --> 03:06:10.72
Also, jocquait on Amazon.

2056
03:06:10.72 --> 03:06:16.72
Here's an actual, again, this is a certified verified report.

2057
03:06:16.72 --> 03:06:20.72
I have a cat that used to catch one or two mice per month.

2058
03:06:20.72 --> 03:06:23.72
I forgot to pick up a tea bag after I brewed it.

2059
03:06:23.72 --> 03:06:25.72
And the cat ate the tea bag.

2060
03:06:25.72 --> 03:06:30.72
Now my cat is bringing home raccoons, full grown rabbits, and even the neighbors dog.

2061
03:06:30.72 --> 03:06:31.72
So be careful.

2062
03:06:31.72 --> 03:06:34.72
Don't let your cat get it unless your neighbor's dog has been annoying.

2063
03:06:34.72 --> 03:06:36.72
No, that's jocquait.

2064
03:06:36.72 --> 03:06:37.72
You can have it.

2065
03:06:37.72 --> 03:06:40.72
And it's not, doesn't take, the thing is doesn't taste like normal tea.

2066
03:06:40.72 --> 03:06:42.72
You taste like victory.

2067
03:06:42.72 --> 03:06:43.72
All right.

2068
03:06:43.72 --> 03:06:46.72
Way the warrior kid boom.

2069
03:06:46.72 --> 03:06:48.72
Also, this is a warning about way the warrior kid.

2070
03:06:48.72 --> 03:06:54.72
When you order way the warrior kid, just go ahead and also order a pull-up bar.

2071
03:06:54.72 --> 03:06:58.72
Some flashcards, some healthy food, and a jiu-jitsu geek.

2072
03:06:58.72 --> 03:07:03.72
Because when your kid gets done reading this factually, they're going to want to be stronger, better, tougher.

2073
03:07:03.72 --> 03:07:04.72
And smarter.

2074
03:07:04.72 --> 03:07:11.72
So supply them the way they need to be supplied, quit playing around, get some.

2075
03:07:11.72 --> 03:07:16.72
Also, the discipline equals freedom field manual.

2076
03:07:16.72 --> 03:07:18.72
There's no book like this.

2077
03:07:18.72 --> 03:07:19.72
Doesn't exist.

2078
03:07:19.72 --> 03:07:22.72
It is not a normal book.

2079
03:07:22.72 --> 03:07:24.72
It's kind of like the podcast.

2080
03:07:24.72 --> 03:07:27.72
This podcast is not for everyone.

2081
03:07:27.72 --> 03:07:30.72
Not everyone wants to listen to this podcast.

2082
03:07:30.72 --> 03:07:31.72
That's okay.

2083
03:07:31.72 --> 03:07:34.72
I'm not making a podcast for everyone.

2084
03:07:34.72 --> 03:07:39.72
We're making a podcast for people that like to get after it.

2085
03:07:39.72 --> 03:07:47.72
So this book is not for people that want to read junk.

2086
03:07:47.72 --> 03:07:49.72
Some people don't get the podcast.

2087
03:07:49.72 --> 03:07:51.72
Some people aren't going to understand the book.

2088
03:07:51.72 --> 03:07:53.72
They're not going to know where it's coming from.

2089
03:07:53.72 --> 03:07:55.72
That's okay.

2090
03:07:55.72 --> 03:08:00.72
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not toning down the podcast.

2091
03:08:00.72 --> 03:08:03.72
We're not saying, oh, you know what?

2092
03:08:03.72 --> 03:08:08.72
I think everyone would like it more if we did more, you know, interspersed some jokes throughout it.

2093
03:08:08.72 --> 03:08:14.72
And maybe if we made it a 45 minutes and do a little fun presentation and I get some back up music.

2094
03:08:14.72 --> 03:08:17.72
Just to kind of a little jangle to make people get in the spirit.

2095
03:08:17.72 --> 03:08:20.72
We're not doing that.

2096
03:08:20.72 --> 03:08:21.72
Not happening.

2097
03:08:21.72 --> 03:08:22.72
Yeah.

2098
03:08:22.72 --> 03:08:29.72
If you want to listen to a little jangle or a little, you know, metallic riff to get you in the zone on the beginning of the podcast.

2099
03:08:29.72 --> 03:08:30.72
That's cool.

2100
03:08:30.72 --> 03:08:31.72
If you want that, that's awesome.

2101
03:08:31.72 --> 03:08:32.72
There's other podcasts that offer it.

2102
03:08:32.72 --> 03:08:33.72
We don't offer it here.

2103
03:08:33.72 --> 03:08:36.72
You know what you're going to get with the book.

2104
03:08:36.72 --> 03:08:44.72
If you're looking for a, you know, 50 shades of gray, you're not going to get that.

2105
03:08:44.72 --> 03:08:45.72
But that's the cool thing.

2106
03:08:45.72 --> 03:08:50.72
The cool thing is that the publisher let me do whatever I wanted to do.

2107
03:08:50.72 --> 03:08:51.72
So I did.

2108
03:08:51.72 --> 03:08:58.72
And I made the feeling, you're going to feel that the feeling of the podcast.

2109
03:08:58.72 --> 03:09:05.72
The feeling of the podcast is the same feeling that the book gets you.

2110
03:09:05.72 --> 03:09:07.72
So it's.

2111
03:09:07.72 --> 03:09:09.72
Little heavy.

2112
03:09:09.72 --> 03:09:11.72
Little dark, right?

2113
03:09:11.72 --> 03:09:12.72
Sparse, right?

2114
03:09:12.72 --> 03:09:13.72
Sure.

2115
03:09:13.72 --> 03:09:14.72
Get after it.

2116
03:09:14.72 --> 03:09:15.72
That's in there.

2117
03:09:15.72 --> 03:09:19.72
Anyways, this political field freedom field manual.

2118
03:09:19.72 --> 03:09:20.72
Order it.

2119
03:09:20.72 --> 03:09:22.72
It's not printed.

2120
03:09:22.72 --> 03:09:24.72
I'll give you an, living in an example.

2121
03:09:24.72 --> 03:09:27.72
It's not printed on white paper.

2122
03:09:27.72 --> 03:09:30.72
So the straight up, let's just go from there.

2123
03:09:30.72 --> 03:09:32.72
It's actually printed.

2124
03:09:32.72 --> 03:09:37.72
The background is all images.

2125
03:09:37.72 --> 03:09:39.72
Black and white images.

2126
03:09:39.72 --> 03:09:40.72
I know that comes as a picture.

2127
03:09:40.72 --> 03:09:41.72
Brace everyone.

2128
03:09:41.72 --> 03:09:42.72
Sure.

2129
03:09:42.72 --> 03:09:44.72
And then put over that is words.

2130
03:09:44.72 --> 03:09:46.72
So there you go.

2131
03:09:46.72 --> 03:09:48.72
Little indicator is what the, the field manual is like.

2132
03:09:48.72 --> 03:09:49.72
You can get that.

2133
03:09:49.72 --> 03:09:51.72
A good pre order now.

2134
03:09:51.72 --> 03:09:52.72
Of course, extreme ownership.

2135
03:09:52.72 --> 03:09:53.72
It's a little book.

2136
03:09:53.72 --> 03:09:54.72
It's about leadership.

2137
03:09:54.72 --> 03:09:56.72
Actually it's about combat leadership.

2138
03:09:56.72 --> 03:10:02.72
And how you can take the combat leadership principles that we've learned on the battlefield

2139
03:10:02.72 --> 03:10:03.72
and climb to your life.

2140
03:10:03.72 --> 03:10:04.72
You can get that book too.

2141
03:10:04.72 --> 03:10:06.72
If you want it.

2142
03:10:06.72 --> 03:10:09.72
We also have Ashland front consulting.

2143
03:10:09.72 --> 03:10:12.72
Me, Lave Babin, JP to now.

2144
03:10:12.72 --> 03:10:13.72
Dave Burke.

2145
03:10:13.72 --> 03:10:16.72
We will come and help your team align your leadership.

2146
03:10:16.72 --> 03:10:18.72
So you can crush your enemies.

2147
03:10:18.72 --> 03:10:21.72
You just heard Sydney Jerry saying it.

2148
03:10:21.72 --> 03:10:24.72
A leadership is the thing that makes you overcome.

2149
03:10:24.72 --> 03:10:27.72
Seemingly impossible things.

2150
03:10:27.72 --> 03:10:29.72
So if your leadership isn't square away,

2151
03:10:29.72 --> 03:10:31.72
you're not going to overcome them.

2152
03:10:31.72 --> 03:10:33.72
So you need to get in the game.

2153
03:10:33.72 --> 03:10:36.72
You can contact us info at Ashland front.com.

2154
03:10:36.72 --> 03:10:38.72
If you want that.

2155
03:10:38.72 --> 03:10:42.72
Also the monster we just got back from the Austin monster.

2156
03:10:42.72 --> 03:10:43.72
Outstanding.

2157
03:10:43.72 --> 03:10:44.72
Outstanding.

2158
03:10:44.72 --> 03:10:45.72
It was awesome.

2159
03:10:45.72 --> 03:10:47.72
So many great people in there.

2160
03:10:47.72 --> 03:10:50.72
Lessons learned knowledge spread.

2161
03:10:50.72 --> 03:10:53.72
Tim Kennedy was there.

2162
03:10:53.72 --> 03:10:55.72
Tim Kennedy showed up.

2163
03:10:55.72 --> 03:10:57.72
And it was cool.

2164
03:10:57.72 --> 03:11:01.72
And I didn't realize it until we were at Gitu.

2165
03:11:01.72 --> 03:11:04.72
And I think I came up to you and said this during Gitu.

2166
03:11:04.72 --> 03:11:06.72
So the last night we had Thursday.

2167
03:11:06.72 --> 03:11:08.72
Then Friday and the Friday night we go to Gitu.

2168
03:11:08.72 --> 03:11:11.72
We went to 10th planet at Austin.

2169
03:11:11.72 --> 03:11:12.72
Austin 10th planet.

2170
03:11:12.72 --> 03:11:14.72
Gitu with my boy Curtis.

2171
03:11:14.72 --> 03:11:16.72
Todd White was there.

2172
03:11:16.72 --> 03:11:17.72
And Todd White was staying.

2173
03:11:17.72 --> 03:11:18.72
Who represent?

2174
03:11:18.72 --> 03:11:20.72
Yeah, he's an old school.

2175
03:11:20.72 --> 03:11:23.72
He's me and him are from the same era.

2176
03:11:23.72 --> 03:11:24.72
Yeah.

2177
03:11:24.72 --> 03:11:28.72
We're from the same era from back in the day.

2178
03:11:28.72 --> 03:11:30.72
Only he's a better artist.

2179
03:11:30.72 --> 03:11:32.72
A better artist in me.

2180
03:11:32.72 --> 03:11:37.72
So what we went and what I realized is this.

2181
03:11:37.72 --> 03:11:40.72
You know like way the warrior kid.

2182
03:11:40.72 --> 03:11:43.72
People say, oh man, I wish I had that book when I was a kid.

2183
03:11:43.72 --> 03:11:44.72
An extreme ownership.

2184
03:11:44.72 --> 03:11:48.72
People say, oh man, I wish I had that book when I started out.

2185
03:11:48.72 --> 03:11:51.72
And when I got promoted five years ago.

2186
03:11:51.72 --> 03:11:53.72
And you know what I say about way the warrior kid?

2187
03:11:53.72 --> 03:11:55.72
I wish I had it when I was a kid.

2188
03:11:55.72 --> 03:11:57.72
You know what I say about extreme ownership?

2189
03:11:57.72 --> 03:12:00.72
I wish I had it when I was a assistant,

2190
03:12:00.72 --> 03:12:01.72
a student, a student, a commuter.

2191
03:12:01.72 --> 03:12:02.72
I wish I had it.

2192
03:12:02.72 --> 03:12:03.72
I didn't have it.

2193
03:12:03.72 --> 03:12:05.72
And what's cool about the monster is.

2194
03:12:05.72 --> 03:12:07.72
So that feeling when you go to the monster,

2195
03:12:07.72 --> 03:12:12.72
you're giving just like we're just giving this massive amount of information.

2196
03:12:12.72 --> 03:12:17.72
Pragmatic information that you can take and you can execute with.

2197
03:12:17.72 --> 03:12:22.72
And so when we were at GJitsu, I realized man, we just all this.

2198
03:12:22.72 --> 03:12:26.72
These people in this room just got all this information.

2199
03:12:26.72 --> 03:12:30.72
And it and it's so practical that you can take back your team.

2200
03:12:30.72 --> 03:12:32.72
And then on top of all that, here's a little something else.

2201
03:12:32.72 --> 03:12:33.72
GJitsu.

2202
03:12:33.72 --> 03:12:34.72
Yeah.

2203
03:12:34.72 --> 03:12:40.72
Because only one quarter of the people that came to GJitsu had ever trained GJitsu before.

2204
03:12:40.72 --> 03:12:41.72
Yeah.

2205
03:12:41.72 --> 03:12:45.72
The other was a 50 people that had never trained before.

2206
03:12:45.72 --> 03:12:48.72
So they're getting this gift, the gift of GJitsu.

2207
03:12:48.72 --> 03:12:49.72
The little angel.

2208
03:12:49.72 --> 03:12:50.72
Yeah.

2209
03:12:50.72 --> 03:12:51.72
Little angel now.

2210
03:12:51.72 --> 03:12:54.72
I would say 50% of them will go back and start training.

2211
03:12:54.72 --> 03:12:55.72
Yeah.

2212
03:12:55.72 --> 03:12:56.72
Maybe more.

2213
03:12:56.72 --> 03:12:57.72
I wish it was 100%.

2214
03:12:57.72 --> 03:12:58.72
Yeah, it might be.

2215
03:12:58.72 --> 03:12:59.72
Yeah.

2216
03:12:59.72 --> 03:13:01.72
It'd be a depends on what you're into.

2217
03:13:01.72 --> 03:13:02.72
Yeah.

2218
03:13:02.72 --> 03:13:03.72
It's hard.

2219
03:13:03.72 --> 03:13:06.72
It was always bizarre to me that when I introduced someone to GJitsu.

2220
03:13:06.72 --> 03:13:07.72
It was a 100%.

2221
03:13:07.72 --> 03:13:08.72
It was a 100%.

2222
03:13:08.72 --> 03:13:09.72
I don't know.

2223
03:13:09.72 --> 03:13:10.72
It's a 100% conversion rate.

2224
03:13:10.72 --> 03:13:11.72
Yeah.

2225
03:13:11.72 --> 03:13:12.72
100%.

2226
03:13:12.72 --> 03:13:14.72
Oh, you just chokes me and I couldn't stop you.

2227
03:13:14.72 --> 03:13:15.72
I didn't even learn that 100%.

2228
03:13:15.72 --> 03:13:18.72
Otherwise, I go through life vulnerable to being choked by anyone.

2229
03:13:18.72 --> 03:13:19.72
I don't like that feeling.

2230
03:13:19.72 --> 03:13:20.72
Yeah.

2231
03:13:20.72 --> 03:13:22.72
No, I don't like that feeling.

2232
03:13:22.72 --> 03:13:28.72
The mustard too is sprinkled and I mean, heart sprinkle hard, by the way, which is a very critical

2233
03:13:28.72 --> 03:13:29.72
compelling part.

2234
03:13:29.72 --> 03:13:31.72
In my opinion, is this social stuff.

2235
03:13:31.72 --> 03:13:34.72
And I don't mean social like you're just cruising and not learning.

2236
03:13:34.72 --> 03:13:36.72
I mean, the people you meet.

2237
03:13:36.72 --> 03:13:37.72
Oh, yeah.

2238
03:13:37.72 --> 03:13:41.72
Well, you definitely are going to meet good people there because everyone there is in the game

2239
03:13:41.72 --> 03:13:42.72
big dime.

2240
03:13:42.72 --> 03:13:43.72
And they're all looking to get better.

2241
03:13:43.72 --> 03:13:45.72
They're all invested to get better.

2242
03:13:45.72 --> 03:13:49.72
And the other thing is, you know, we're hanging out.

2243
03:13:49.72 --> 03:13:52.72
I said, I mean, yeah, yeah, no, there's me,

2244
03:13:52.72 --> 03:13:54.72
Lave, Dave, J.P. Echo.

2245
03:13:54.72 --> 03:13:55.72
We're not.

2246
03:13:55.72 --> 03:13:56.72
There's no green room.

2247
03:13:56.72 --> 03:13:57.72
It doesn't exist.

2248
03:13:57.72 --> 03:13:58.72
We don't even take breaks.

2249
03:13:58.72 --> 03:14:08.72
Just like when we take a break to let the audience like go to the restaurant or grab a, you know, a cup of coffee or a

2250
03:14:08.72 --> 03:14:15.72
chocolate tea, we just, we just stand there. Like we step down off of stage and we get everything lines up.

2251
03:14:15.72 --> 03:14:21.72
We talk questions and you know what I was doing this time was I was like, instead of answering one person's question just to that person.

2252
03:14:21.72 --> 03:14:22.72
I was in a room.

2253
03:14:22.72 --> 03:14:25.72
Because he's asking the question, everyone coming here is near anybody.

2254
03:14:25.72 --> 03:14:28.72
Hey, there's there's 12 people standing in line.

2255
03:14:28.72 --> 03:14:29.72
Yeah.

2256
03:14:29.72 --> 03:14:32.72
And instead of answering this one question, this one guy was bring no.

2257
03:14:32.72 --> 03:14:33.72
Hey, everyone come up here.

2258
03:14:33.72 --> 03:14:34.72
Come on up here.

2259
03:14:34.72 --> 03:14:34.72
Yeah.

2260
03:14:34.72 --> 03:14:36.72
And you can all hear this because what's your who knows?

2261
03:14:36.72 --> 03:14:39.72
Maybe those are some of those questions. Maybe it's something you're going to experience in the future. I don't know.

2262
03:14:39.72 --> 03:14:43.72
But you might as well listen and maybe you have a better solution than I have.

2263
03:14:43.72 --> 03:14:45.72
Yeah. So it's like a like a little.

2264
03:14:45.72 --> 03:14:46.72
A little break down table. Yeah.

2265
03:14:46.72 --> 03:14:47.72
Break down.

2266
03:14:47.72 --> 03:14:48.72
Yeah.

2267
03:14:48.72 --> 03:14:48.72
Yeah.

2268
03:14:48.72 --> 03:14:49.72
It's cool.

2269
03:14:49.72 --> 03:14:50.72
That's true.

2270
03:14:50.72 --> 03:14:50.72
You.

2271
03:14:50.72 --> 03:14:51.72
We take breaks.

2272
03:14:51.72 --> 03:14:53.72
Everyone, there's breaks throughout the thing.

2273
03:14:53.72 --> 03:14:54.72
You take breaks.

2274
03:14:54.72 --> 03:14:54.72
Yeah.

2275
03:14:54.72 --> 03:14:55.72
Jock on.

2276
03:14:55.72 --> 03:14:56.72
Don't take breaks.

2277
03:14:56.72 --> 03:14:58.72
Because break time is talk time.

2278
03:14:58.72 --> 03:14:59.72
It's talk time.

2279
03:14:59.72 --> 03:14:59.72
You guys.

2280
03:14:59.72 --> 03:15:00.72
You're a little slow.

2281
03:15:00.72 --> 03:15:00.72
Yeah.

2282
03:15:00.72 --> 03:15:01.72
Yeah.

2283
03:15:01.72 --> 03:15:02.72
Sign a book.

2284
03:15:02.72 --> 03:15:03.72
Whatever.

2285
03:15:03.72 --> 03:15:04.72
Yeah.

2286
03:15:04.72 --> 03:15:05.72
No green room.

2287
03:15:05.72 --> 03:15:05.72
No green room.

2288
03:15:05.72 --> 03:15:07.72
So that's the master.

2289
03:15:07.72 --> 03:15:13.72
And by the way, they've sold out all of them that we've done have been sold out.

2290
03:15:13.72 --> 03:15:19.72
Now the next one that we got coming up is September 14th and 15th back the Omni hotel in downtown San Diego, California,

2291
03:15:19.72 --> 03:15:20.72
Master Zero Zero Four.

2292
03:15:20.72 --> 03:15:22.72
It's gonna sell out.

2293
03:15:22.72 --> 03:15:23.72
This is a known fact.

2294
03:15:23.72 --> 03:15:28.72
So if you want to come, it's September 14th and 15th, that is right around the corner.

2295
03:15:28.72 --> 03:15:29.72
Yeah.

2296
03:15:29.72 --> 03:15:32.72
So if you want to come to that, come to that.

2297
03:15:32.72 --> 03:15:36.72
Extremeownership.com is where you can register if you want to.

2298
03:15:36.72 --> 03:15:38.72
Also, by the way, this is interesting.

2299
03:15:38.72 --> 03:15:42.72
If you train you Jitsu or if you're interested in training Jitsu,

2300
03:15:42.72 --> 03:15:44.72
or you're interested in training Jitsu,

2301
03:15:44.72 --> 03:15:50.72
Origin, up in Maine has this immersion camp that they do.

2302
03:15:50.72 --> 03:15:52.72
I'm going.

2303
03:15:52.72 --> 03:15:54.72
Echo's going with me.

2304
03:15:54.72 --> 03:15:56.72
We're going up there.

2305
03:15:56.72 --> 03:15:57.72
It is.

2306
03:15:57.72 --> 03:15:59.72
There's two sessions that they run.

2307
03:15:59.72 --> 03:16:04.72
It's the 20th August, 20th, the 23rd or August 24th through the 27th.

2308
03:16:04.72 --> 03:16:05.72
Those are the two different sessions.

2309
03:16:05.72 --> 03:16:07.72
Or you can come for the whole week.

2310
03:16:07.72 --> 03:16:11.72
Anyways, I'm going to be there for those middle three days.

2311
03:16:11.72 --> 03:16:12.72
Like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

2312
03:16:12.72 --> 03:16:16.72
So I'm going to be there for the last day of the first camp on the first day of the

2313
03:16:16.72 --> 03:16:18.72
lot of the second camp.

2314
03:16:18.72 --> 03:16:20.72
And I'll be on there on the middle day.

2315
03:16:20.72 --> 03:16:24.72
We're going to be training rolling, talking, hanging out, eating lobster, eating

2316
03:16:24.72 --> 03:16:27.72
steaks, just generally getting after it.

2317
03:16:27.72 --> 03:16:30.72
So you're going to origin Maine.com.

2318
03:16:30.72 --> 03:16:33.72
If you want to come up, there's not a lot of spaces for that.

2319
03:16:33.72 --> 03:16:39.72
It's not that's like I think the most they're going to go is 200 people.

2320
03:16:39.72 --> 03:16:42.72
So that's not a lot of spaces.

2321
03:16:42.72 --> 03:16:45.72
So if you want to come up, register quick.

2322
03:16:45.72 --> 03:16:47.72
And I'll see you guys up there in Maine.

2323
03:16:47.72 --> 03:16:52.72
What I like about it is, unlike the monster, where everything is scheduled,

2324
03:16:52.72 --> 03:16:54.72
like we don't have a lot of break time.

2325
03:16:54.72 --> 03:16:56.72
And even the break time is working.

2326
03:16:56.72 --> 03:16:59.72
This thing, I mean, you can only train you, Jitsu.

2327
03:16:59.72 --> 03:17:00.72
What?

2328
03:17:00.72 --> 03:17:01.72
Six hours a day, maybe?

2329
03:17:01.72 --> 03:17:02.72
10, probably.

2330
03:17:02.72 --> 03:17:03.72
You know what I mean?

2331
03:17:03.72 --> 03:17:06.72
Two hours in the morning, two hours at lunch, two hours in the evening.

2332
03:17:06.72 --> 03:17:08.72
So that's six hours.

2333
03:17:08.72 --> 03:17:09.72
You're going to sleep four hours.

2334
03:17:09.72 --> 03:17:11.72
So you still got 14 hours left in the day.

2335
03:17:11.72 --> 03:17:12.72
So what are we going to do?

2336
03:17:12.72 --> 03:17:13.72
We're going to kick it.

2337
03:17:13.72 --> 03:17:14.72
Yeah.

2338
03:17:14.72 --> 03:17:15.72
We're going to cruise.

2339
03:17:15.72 --> 03:17:16.72
There's a lake.

2340
03:17:16.72 --> 03:17:17.72
There's kayaks.

2341
03:17:17.72 --> 03:17:20.72
There's a zip lines and whatever.

2342
03:17:20.72 --> 03:17:21.72
Yeah.

2343
03:17:21.72 --> 03:17:25.72
We'll just go lay in bed and try and recover from the Jitsu sessions.

2344
03:17:25.72 --> 03:17:26.72
So yeah.

2345
03:17:26.72 --> 03:17:30.72
A bunch of good people coming up, really good after that, if you want to come up and hang out,

2346
03:17:30.72 --> 03:17:31.72
do it.

2347
03:17:31.72 --> 03:17:34.72
And that will work.

2348
03:17:34.72 --> 03:17:35.72
We'll see you up there.

2349
03:17:35.72 --> 03:17:38.72
Either at the monster or we'll see you at the immersion.

2350
03:17:38.72 --> 03:17:39.72
Jitsu, can't wait.

2351
03:17:39.72 --> 03:17:41.72
How do you register for that one?

2352
03:17:41.72 --> 03:17:42.72

Gotcha.

2358
03:17:51.72 --> 03:17:52.72
Yeah.

2359
03:17:52.72 --> 03:17:54.72
There's a certain element of like if you can't figure it out.

2360
03:17:54.72 --> 03:17:55.72

2361
03:17:55.72 --> 03:17:59.72

Today register today.

2364
03:18:01.72 --> 03:18:02.72
Yeah.

2365
03:18:02.72 --> 03:18:03.72
They always think today.

2366
03:18:03.72 --> 03:18:04.72
Yeah.

2367
03:18:04.72 --> 03:18:05.72
I know they say that.

2368
03:18:05.72 --> 03:18:09.72
And today by the time this podcast comes out, I won't even be today.

2369
03:18:09.72 --> 03:18:10.72
Yeah.

2370
03:18:10.72 --> 03:18:12.72
So.

2371
03:18:12.72 --> 03:18:14.72
All right.

2372
03:18:14.72 --> 03:18:15.72
Also.

2373
03:18:15.72 --> 03:18:19.72
Until we're at one of those events.

2374
03:18:19.72 --> 03:18:23.72
If you want to roll with us virtually.

2375
03:18:23.72 --> 03:18:26.72
We are on the interwebs.

2376
03:18:26.72 --> 03:18:31.72
The Twitter, the Instagram, the Facebook.

2377
03:18:31.72 --> 03:18:34.72
Watch.

2378
03:18:34.72 --> 03:18:36.72
Echo is at Echo Charles.

2379
03:18:36.72 --> 03:18:42.72
And I am at Jocco Willink and finally thank you to everyone for listening to this podcast.

2380
03:18:42.72 --> 03:18:45.72
And for supporting this podcast.

2381
03:18:45.72 --> 03:18:52.72
Which, by the way, is made possible by our military.

2382
03:18:52.72 --> 03:18:57.72
Who protects our great nation from evil.

2383
03:18:57.72 --> 03:19:02.72
This podcast is made possible by police law enforcement firefighters EMTs.

2384
03:19:02.72 --> 03:19:11.72
First responders that keep us safe and orderly here at home.

2385
03:19:11.72 --> 03:19:19.72
And it's made possible by each and every one of you out there working in the economy, making

2386
03:19:19.72 --> 03:19:21.72
and creating and building.

2387
03:19:21.72 --> 03:19:26.72
So don't stop doing that.

2388
03:19:26.72 --> 03:19:38.72
And don't ever stop remembering those that went before us.

2389
03:19:38.72 --> 03:19:42.72
Those that still shine down on us.

2390
03:19:42.72 --> 03:19:49.72
And remember that we are not here long.

2391
03:19:49.72 --> 03:19:53.72
And time is fleeting.

2392
03:19:53.72 --> 03:19:56.72
It is ever fleeting.

2393
03:19:56.72 --> 03:20:03.72
So you might as well make it a good hard run.

2394
03:20:03.72 --> 03:20:06.72
And get after it.

2395
03:20:06.72 --> 03:20:14.72
So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco.

2396
03:20:14.72 --> 03:20:21.72
Out.
