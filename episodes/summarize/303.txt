So maybe if I know you too and you both were raised in this super strict way and yet Kerry was like, you know what, you know my mom was just a little bit crazy and that's cool and but Dave was like, it couldn't let it go. This book is going to be, there's so much in this book and I'll start to speed up a little bit I think as we push into the next podcast, hit some of the high waves for the section where they cover the historical disasters, but like I said, it's not like he just talks about the historical disasters and explain what happens. You know, I feel like that's the generic go to, right where it's like the rebel, you know, came from that strict Catholics school, you know, whatever, they just go the other way. So, it's like, you know, like when you're, if you're maybe you support a local bike or gang, but you're not in the bike or gang, but you got friends, you can wear that bike or gang stuff, but you got to have support on there. I don't like, and hey, no criticism of that's your game, but like, in the stuff that people put in there and like, I put in the sugar cup, I shake it up when I drink it and there's nothing I want to echo Charles over here. But when it comes to military stuff, I like military books that are written by military people, not books that are written by theorist or even historians and academics that haven't been there. Again, this is where you know, you get into like, you know, Freud and how you're raised and all these little things that are in your childhood and they, and I don't know if that's right or wrong. Ouch, he wrote this in 1976, just saying he's like, hey, if you go to the military right now, you know, this tentative supposition is based on the fact that fewer and fewer of the young consider the military to be a worthwhile career. And the reason I think I don't dip as much into the childhood stuff is I've known people that had authoritarian parents and didn't end up like this, right, had whatever hyper-religious, strict parents and ended up, you know, in every level, every type of different person. What, you know, if you're a in college and you like uniformity and you're looking at your dorm room going gosh, I wish everyone would just be quiet and you're like, oh, you're not enjoying them. Like we know what kind of, we know you're, you're like lean and really hard. So like, all you do is the like, you shouldn't write a book, like exactly, you're the reason why. So here's the original quote, according to the memoirs of Field Marshal Vaughan, Falcon Hein, side by Own Clark Field Marshal, then Ludenh√ºrf's comment, the English soldiers fight like Lions was greeted by his friend, major general Max Hoffman with true, but don't we know they are Lions Led by Donkeys and they got a picture in this book of some general giving a young soldier own award and the caption is Donkey Decorates Alliance. And there's a scene where he's leading this platoon and he runs into, like, I think it's like he's maneuvering to get to some objective and, and he ends up up against, like, a barbed wire face. I feel like they become, you know, if you start to get emotional, which which can happen, especially when you've got wives at stake or you're, you know, you just pointed to hack where it's book. Like, oh, I could see people going, oh, bees the best example because he got the most information. So just to both of what you're saying, that idea, like, oh, those things you go, man, I don't want a bunch of yes men uniform thinking, you know, a group think. So he's having conversations with people telling he's going to write this book and they're like, well, why are you going to do that? Like, hey, if you're a business and you're in the authoritarian, okay, cool, you're going to, you're going to drive some people crazy, whatever. I got to line up in my closet or my, my pantry, but it's, it's like, um, you know, it's like afterburner orange for me. I like to eat sure, but you know, some people, they, they, they, they have like a hole. Professor of Military History University of North Texas director of their military history center, and this is his, his forward to the book, which the reason I wanted to read the forward is because it starts to lay out the themes inside this book and you start to get an understanding of where this guy's coming from. He says, this book is not an attack upon the armed forces, no upon the norm upon the vast majority of senior military commanders who in time of war succeed in tasks which would make the running of a large commercial enterprise seem like child's play by comparison. but it's not supposed to be any spends all this time reacting to the idea that this fence was not on the map and the people are on like, sir, but it's like a barbed wire fence. Norman Dixon's on the psychology of military incompetence is a classic that should be read not because it is true in every detail, but because it offers the military historian analyst or student and important method to discover and rank the manifold reason for military error and defeat. And there's a certain military, like a military bearing, right? And meaning people can start acting crazy and you know having people say no they're not like, okay. But the book is, I mean, you're going to see real quick that this book is pretty incredible book and I don't know how many podcasts we'll do on it. He's like, no, I kind of am used to these type of things going the way that people don't expect it. You run that loop until you figure out what you should do, which is pretty straight, which is seems complicated and you, you know how it tells me, hard, it's going to be hard to make a really like a solid decision. They're going to surprise you because the situation is going to their circuit breaker is going to pop and it's going to blow their minds. So, if you're, if you're about those layers, if you listen to the podcast, you're like, yes, like I'm about the layers, check out the shirt locker that goes cranking out a new shirt every month with a different layer from the podcast presented on them. If you aim this book at yourself and you every time I hear a four every time I say a fouritarian theme instead of thinking like about your boss or about some subordinate leader that you have, if you instead think, oh, how am I a fouritarian?
