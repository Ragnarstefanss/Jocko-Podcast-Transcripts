I mean I knew when my rotation date was but a lot of guys actually made what was called a short time calendar that's a bad idea never never never did that at all so you just every day was a new day you're going to do your best job and if you're doing what you're doing that's the best you can do and that's one more thing I wanted to say this because again we got young folks in the military out there when I was talking about hey some people are afraid some people are in a afraid some people think it's gonna happen them some people think it'll never happen them look wherever you are on that spectrum what what I can say is this there's things that you can control there's things that you can't control and as you're going into combat before you're going to combat train hard be prepared know your weapon systems know your immediate action drills then that's that's the best you can do you've done everything you can to take control over what you can control once you're in combat there's some things that you're not going to be able to control and if you worry about those things it's actually a set it actually negatively impact you if you're worried about things that you can't control if you're worried about what's going on at home if you're worried about mate all those things they're gonna take away your aggressiveness take take away your awareness take away your attention those things are gonna drag you in the wrong direction so don't worry about the things that you can't control it's okay to be afraid too like but he probably wouldn't listen to anybody else because Chris had a great deal of experience driving for it that's one of the misconceptions about the military and it's really one of the misconceptions about leadership is is the last thing that I want as a leader is to have a bunch of yes men that are just going to do what I tell them to do because I told them to do it I want people that are going to say hey Jock I don't know if that's the best idea or hey that we should do this a different way and and people don't think that that's going to happen in the military that's what you want you want that kind of environment inside the military and the good thing is that way when I would make a call and guys would execute I knew it was a good call because no one gave me any pushback because believe me I had a relationship with my guys if I was saying tell them to do something stupid they'd say hey boss we need to we need to put go go on hold right now and figure this out there's got to be a better way so that's the way that that's how I that's how I make good decisions not because I'm great it's because I got a bunch of great guys working for me that are going to tell me hey that's not the right call and that's a classic example right there you know if if Chris who had the experience and had the the the the the where we're fall to say hey boss we don't want to cross right there it's not a good call let's just go 10 meters down mix it up a little bit that's the kind of thing where that that would save lives and the other thing that you just talked about this is another thing that people get really surprised about is even because we work I work with a lot of companies and businesses and people say well you know my guys get complacent with things because you know there's there's it's not combat so people get complacent I always have to explain people get complacent in combat too you go on you go on your 14th patrol on a row in a row and nothing's happened for the last 13 patrols and you think oh you know we can we can cross here or we don't need to we need to pack extra ammo or I don't need to carry that extra radio battery because I have a needed yet but maybe we should go to woodstock I don't think anybody did though but did you feel like like I know that our treatment from the wars from the wars that we've been in the last couple decades you know we've had great treatment from for the most part we've had incredibly incredible treatment from not just from well from from people from normal citizens you know that it's thank you for your service it's thank you for what you did regardless of whatever their political beliefs are as well it's like most people say hey we know that you were doing your job and and that's thank you did you feel mattered did you feel did you feel like it was did you get the negative feedback that we often hear about from Vietnam bets I never got any of the negative Well you get up and fix breakfast you know fix some coffee or some sea rations and you know easy to carry it because your armored personnel carriers wait didn't make a lot of different stuff we'd have somebody would fix this somebody would fix the coffee we'd all kind of share the meal together because you didn't have any food that came out to the field very often and we just sit down maybe the night before that morning with the L.T. and go over what the daily operation was and follow up with a myler cover on the map sheet and a grease pencil and you know go through the checkpoints throughout the course of the day you know if you faced any any difficulties you you know just faced it had on return fire called in artillery maybe you'd get a call an infantry unit to be pinned down nice part of about being armored personnel carriers you could move real fast lay down a lot of suppressing fire and let them back out and save them we did that from Marines as well as United States Army so then um and then this is just what you do this is just the day in day out all day every day and you're during the night time you you stay you know you stay on watch so I don't think it was as easy for him to be a strong leader and a strong decision maker because I think that was on his mind a lot the L.T. was not that way and everybody that we served with was not that way I don't know if I know anybody else that I served with for 10 and a half months that was married other than most of the platoon sergeants or the first sergeant so they have that in the back of their mind they're thinking about you can sense that there may be leaning a little bit towards trying to stay alive and trying to take less risk and you know to all that works is that's not always the best person to have for a leader if you're not tuned in 24-7 while you're there you're in trouble you know that's the only way to survive you have to be conscious of every fly that lands on on your food you know what I mean you're just you just get that heightened sense of awareness that it's probably lucky you can even go to sleep when you lay down at night because you're the adrenaline is pumps so much all day long so I'm sure probably in the back of my mind the use of it or abuse of it was probably something I was conscious of all the time but that never really looked like that was a great alternative path I mean I thought that was fairly easy to recognize that that wasn't good and and I'm not critical of anyone that chose that because everybody's psyche and the way they're handling things at that time the difficulties you're going through or just being out in public missing two legs in a room maybe you need to be high to do that I never felt that way I didn't feel like I needed to explain anything to anybody had to put on any particular performance or airstone make people accept me if you didn't accept me I'm okay with that too you know what I mean that was fine because I'm just going to do what I need to do for my survival and for me to move forward so the biggest thing that we had to do and I mean that was the number one thing in part of the training with you drove where you were commanding a track was you never take the same stream crossing twice you you track the vehicle right directly in front of you you never get outside of the lead tracks tracks in the ground and we'd stay in the patties or around the patties as much as possible because it weren't very likely to put a landmine in the rice patties it would be on the road or the edge of the road or maybe on a rice petty pike that we never never went in that direction very often either and what was your leadership like you know your your young lieutenant platoon commander what was he like what was your platoon sergeant like what did what was your interaction with those guys like and even your vehicle so who was in charge of of your track was he was a young E5 probably 21 or 22 years old at that time and the leadership in my platoon the platoon leader was was a great first lieutenant like oh no you don't need to do that you don't need to do that like kind of like no you can actually do this other thing kind of thing like he made it sound so casual what almost like hey it's almost like he he reversed it all the way back down to the bare decision making of it you know rather than like it's no big deal that's what people feel it's you don't need to think your your weak because you're feeling that you're just going into survival mode you got butterflies in your stomach because your blood's drawn away from there because you want to focus on other things it's a positive thing so don't worry about those things you can't control focus on what you can control and if you're if you're feeling a little bit afraid good that means your your mind isn't the right place you're aware and you're in a hyper sensory mode so you can survive out on the battlefield that's what's going on um what was the what was going on with the mission where you got wounded we've been out on a searching clear for that whole day I mean probably it'd been out in the field for six or seven days at that point I had picked the night longer position we set up that evening about five to six o'clock we were supposed to get resupply and get get hotchow that night brought up by helicopter so I mean it was a real easy decision for me and like October early November 69 that we'll just put those in a trunk someplace and have great memories about walking in the parallel bars so you were done with rehab at nine months well really once you heal and if you're not going to do anything further with prosthetic legs and they need a bed because you're still killing and injuring a lot of people in Vietnam in November 1969 you know you got to move on something's got to happen so 1969 this is this is at the height of like anti-war protests and woodstock was in woodstock was in August of 1969 are you paying attention to that is that entering your world at all or we're we're watching it on the ward in the day room and probably just getting a tremendous amount of enjoyment out of it because we're all sitting around we're all Vietnam combat soldiers you know on the ward I mean it because it's like you still feel like you have those limbs like you feel like you need to scratch behind your knee or scratch you know your hand is itching that type of thing it's almost like you're bald up in a fist where your fingernails are pushed into your hand type of thing and little by little I think is those nerve endings received from the surgery and the amputations a lot of that relaxes and changes I don't get that at all anymore That's good did you and then did you eventually make E6 I did and did that change your position again at some point did you become like the vehicle commander I became what was called the field for a surge with the called six alpha in the in the army I was on the command track out in the field with the company commander and then two other machine gunners on our track so you did you leave your platoon to go and be with the company commander I did and what's your what's your job when you're in that position well basically everything you do for the daily operation you're kind of in charge over overseeing everything you're you know because keep in mind now we've got not just my third platoon out there but the second and the first might be with us or they might be off on an operation of their own sometimes two platoons that go out together and we wanted to go a different direction so you had to be cognizant of where everybody was all the time and what they were doing and any difficulties that they were having and it was a brand new company commander who did not have any Vietnam experience so then it was almost like having to train the CO once he got there but I always felt that if you were thinking about other things like family that was going to make you less aggressive and as far as I can tell if you're aggression if you're not aggressive on the battlefield that has a higher probability of getting you killed than if you're aggressive I think that hesitation is a bad thing and I'm looking at saying and I used to try and make this clear all the time and I'm talking about you know being hyper aggressive and running to your death that's not what I'm talking about but if there's something going on and you're nervous about making a move that's not a good thing to have happening and it would make when I would have guys that I could see you were thinking about other things it would make me nervous that they were going to hesitate when they needed to move or needed to make something happen.
