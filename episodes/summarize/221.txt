hey you know intersection I think it was two nine three two nine three which would have like double digit cigarettes a day and we're realizing hey what's probably go a different way or go through this alleyway and reviewing the satellite imagery to see and understanding and trying to go through do like a dirt dive which is just space was just planning the route in your head and seeing what kind of obstacles you might see or landmarks because GPS wasn't super reliable at the time especially since we had jammers you'll want on 24 seven so that people couldn't remotely detonate ideas we'd try and jam all all frequencies so a lot of times you didn't have GPS so you need to know the route cold and then as a point man being able to take to dismount safely and then guide your platoon to the target on foot and that also takes careful route planning careful route study and making sure you get the right target because I mean you can have pretty bad consequences when you hit the right hit the wrong target and of course your shooter just like everyone everyone's a shooter from the lowest and listed to the OIC is a shooter is responsible for their lanes for engaging the enemy for a turning fire for being a shooter and once you're on target if this is happens to be an overwatch we'd set up the night before and set up sniper overwatch positions so that we had good observations of different angles different lanes that the enemy might try and use to attack us or worse attack our brethren our army and marine corps brothers and sisters who might be doing a route clearance or might be doing a patrol and that's just like one flavor of the many different types of missions that we did you know we talked about DA direct action missions those were a little more direct you know you probably just drive up this and require as much I guess you know trying to be as seraptitious it's kind of going in loud you're not feeling anyone you're going loud aggressive hard and I didn't I wasn't always good at it you know because sometimes you're fed up like mustering a 0 500 when the muster is really like 0 700 like why am I here for 2 hours because you know maybe the squallie to put 15 minutes of grace time before like the company commander before the fake you know like rotsy leader or whatever and then eventually works out there you're like 2 hours before you're there standing there 2 hours of attention before you need to be there you know like little things like that and for some especially I saw some former enlisted having a really hard time keeping their thoughts to themselves team guys are even worse so my program the seaming animal program did not take into consideration the program where you stay in listed and there wasn't because it wasn't a good route it just wasn't considered because the time of the instruction was written that in listed program wasn't written and I wanted to apply to that on the program but was being told by my my you know my superiors at the rots unit that I couldn't do it because of the instruction and that's I'm for I am not I am not a believer in circumventing the chain of command and in this case I let my who's a lieutenant like proctor let him know like I'd like to see if I can pursue this avenue and a parallel path and trying to get approval for this and the response I got was a good luck and that's when I reached out to you and told you the situation and you asked a specific officer who I still actually keep in touch with because I remember he did not know who I was but the very fact that we were both from the same brotherhood from teams that he went out of his way and he was working I think in buepers or some personnel command that had access to these types to the people that can make these types of decisions and he was able to secure or at least share this story what I was going through to the right people and once those right people heard the situation is like well that's easy of course it just wasn't it wasn't considered because it's a clerical thing not because it's not like shouldn't be allowed so once the right people heard the story that I I think I could have done better at what point did you decide maybe going into space would be a good idea so we talked about accidents and we call whatever we want I have no plan I had no plan to do any of these things I we talked about I had no plan to be a doctor it's just something that came out of deployment of a body of seeing the compassion and the good that physicians and nurses were doing to our brothers and sisters who were wounded in combat and I wanted to be able to do that type of good as well and that's why I directed to medicine space was never on the horizon we talked a little bit about where I came from that scared little boy and grew up under my father shadow I never thought I could have been a seal or a doctor or an astronaut there's no way it was a different life and I was a different person and the first time I heard about NASA and this opportunity I don't I don't have a great story for it it's just I heard about being national and it's like that's kind of interesting when we're like other than space exploration like what you do and learning about the impact that national arts can have on our next generation and what Apollo did for our country I mean in the 60s we were able to land a human on the moon with that technology despite a growing race with Russia and all the politics going on during that era Kennedy's assassination we were able to complete that and that secured American preeminence in science technology for decades to come I certainly believe that and the benefits we got from that are you can't count that and learning a little bit more about that and how astronauts have had the opportunity to represent humanity for good and bring together countries in a way that politics and alliances cannot do when you talk to some of the Apollo astronauts who landed on the moon and they did their international travel the comment the feedback they would get from people would be we did it but some of the hardest years of my life because it was different I couldn't grind through it by just hitting harder with the way this is going from university San Diego to Harvard or just going from the team so you're just going okay at transition it was some of the hardest years of my life because it's not like you could just push through like you can in some of the things you do in the bloods or in teams and the bloods is a challenge but as you and I know training is nothing compared to war but you think training is hard you think how weak is hard it's hard right until you get hit in the face in a real combat operation and then you realize oh I've reset my benchmark for what is hard or what is painful or what is suffering and even having that benchmark going into transitioning to civilian life it was hard for me I was trying to fit in four year degree in three years trying to do really well because I knew I had a good grades to be considered for a school like Harvard I had my first child I was working part time but probably the worst of it was I was not right in the head with my decompression with post war I took a lot of that anger and hatred my heart and I still had it there and you know I had you know no power but the people that people that you know and the relationship that you build over time is like hey guys here's what's going on and the guys that are in powerful positions or in the right position and the right spot with the right poll can make things happen and and they do it for the right reasons why like just like you said it wasn't because it wasn't the right thing was absolutely the right thing to do it's like he's not getting you know rassed by the troops people aren't making fun of him for this that or the other thing that's when you that's when you know a guy's a real problem is when he's actually so far outside that's spectrum that they go you know what we don't even we don't even want to we don't even want to do that with this guy because he's not one of us and we don't want him as part of the team wise words I've always heard that I believe it if if you weren't getting rattle if you weren't being made fun of then people didn't like you and that's just the coach I think it's hard for people outside of that community to understand why we were so hard in each other and why it was born out of love it really is it's a a lot of those actions and you just the way we conducted ourselves and I mean some of the people closest friends we were just you know just dog on each other all the time to this day but you know so many emotions when you show up your petoni like a lot of guys I was just so hungry to be accepted to be a good job like look I can put out I'm gonna ask it like I want to be here because I want to be here and getting welcome like that was I I wanted that and it's a different world I feel like I was fortunate enough to see two sides of the Navy because that is certainly not at all condoning that behavior but it is what it is it is what it was and I've kind of at the cost where I got to see that side of the teams and I'm sure it's still those on but it's changed a little bit right yep you're learning it's kind of like SKT you're learning the basics of what it's like to be an effective astronaut but that training never goes away like just like being a seal you don't stop shooting just because you made it through SKT it's just the beginning of your of your learning of your professional development and you're maintaining all of that so you continue all of those activities maintain speaking your Russian practicing in the space you'd flying in a jet you know weekly and then supporting on going mission so if you're not assigned which I am not assigned I mean there's a pool of astronaut that are always supporting on going missions because that's a priority is supporting on going missions and right now we have astronauts that have man the international space station for 20 years continuously there are people adult where we have been orbiting in man presence in the space station one of the people have been alive and we are looking to go back to the moon in 2024 with our eyes set for deeper exploration two Mars in beyond it was we did it and that was powerful that countries could come together and see that as a human accomplishment so there's something about space that takes away those borders because when you're up there you don't see these distinct borders between countries you just see a lot of blue and a lot of land and you see how fragile the planet is so once I learned a little bit about that type of impact and that you can have a huge impact on the next generation of explorers of scientists of people who want to be a better version of themselves maybe I could reach out to those kids just like me who are scared tired who don't think they can amount to anything who don't think they're worth anything if I could reach out to them and let them know that hey doesn't matter where you're from with the right attitude with the right hard work if you get up every time you fail you can amount to something and you can do positive work you can leave a good impact a positive mark for our world that meant a lot to me and that's when I put my name in the hat and wanted to be a nationalot because it was completely consistent with my goals that I promised Mikey Mark Ryan long list of our brothers who are not here with us today that I would for the rest of my life do something to impact positive good in our world is it um was it is there a recruiter that comes around I mean where did you dare pick up a brochure in class where did you you must have the idea get you must have been watching you know a movie or something and gone so that was huge huge learning for me and I'm very thankful that I had the years that in going to college are working in a different line of work to really understand that a different human side a different meaning of what I meant to be human I was I remember I had conversations with life and death because life and death the two-partue commanders you know we were getting asked questions we were getting the people that we're saying well should you guys been going on the day or should you guys been working with like we were getting all those questions and I had a legitimate sit down with both those guys and I was like listen we cannot be emotional about this we cannot respond it came after we went to a meeting where it was an officer detailer meeting and we were you know it's sort of plotting out what the what an officer career should look like blah and so he goes on to point it just like you all did with the attitude of like okay cool you know nothing's going on we're going to go to a place with a good gym will train some Iraqi soldiers and we will you know get big and then sure enough as fate would have it you guys roll in and pretty quickly after you guys roll in the I don't know if you know this side of the story but the conventional some of the conventional commanders that were there when task unit bruiser was there found out that some of the guys from task unit bruiser were back in country and put out a very specific request for forces that spelled out exactly who they wanted and that's that's why you guys ended up getting the call for supporting the efforts inside of solder city which was a freaking disaster at the time yeah what you described took me years to learn and it is probably one of the most important traits of being a leader is having one the emotional and social intelligence of knowing your audience knowing who you're talking to and being dynamic enough that you can switch and craft your language your body language your tone of voice everything you do to suit the person you're talking to you can the way I would talk to a puttune seals would be very different then the way I would talk to a 60 year old COPD patient and COPD is like a long disease from common in folks who smoke who is in the hospital for the end of the time who wants to quit smoking and is frustrated and needs some guidance that patient is a different population and being able to have the clarity and intelligence to know that and to switch your language appropriately is so important to yield results and that goes for everything I'm you just that's why blanket leadership tenants don't work guiding principles work but you need a format to your own style to achieve the results and I think a lot of it starts with awareness with mindfulness of your own emotions of the emotions the body language that others are telling you because it gives you hints as to what they're feeling and if you know what they're feeling you understand where they're coming from that perspective you can disarm people by finding common ground and achieving results because most of the time all people want good things they just disagree on how to achieve that and again I don't want to sound fatalistic about this because I didn't think about it in a way I didn't think about it like hey throw caution when this is going to happen anyways it wasn't like that at all it was like reality the reality was you know the reality was I'm talking to the brigade commander every day I'm talking to the Italian commanders every day I know what to go on out there in some cases I'm tracking it you know by the hour and so that in my gut was the hardest was the most was the hardest thing that I had to deal with was just man just being worried about you guys that was it it's not time wasted that's not I would still be very feel very privileged and it'd be a huge honor to support on going missions so to me I have I don't know when I'll be assigned and I don't care I will be happy with whatever I had the honor of doing and I will fulfill any role to the best my ability future is bright well listen Johnny we've actually been going out at for a little over four hours right now I know we went through your whole life which is not bad in four hours what I know people are going to want to contact you talk to you you know getting touch with you I know that you're on social media now big time unfortunately I say my words carefully and that's that meant so much to me so a lot of times I don't understand when a person who is in buddha and is not a performer and everyone else wants him to quit how they could like be there because I care so much about what my brothers think that if they didn't want me there I would never be there I would never want to slow anyone else down I don't know to answer your question you know there were certainly hard times I don't think there was ever a time where I wanted like I'm gonna quit but there was definitely times where I wanted the pain to stop and one particular time I remember it was you know that two hour nap you get in buds or in hell week and you said sustained presence on the moon sustained while getting to the moon by 2024 at this current time is not we are not planning on having sustained presence in 2024 by 2028 we are planning on having sustained presence on the moon so having the lunar outpost and learning what it's like to live called a planetary haka-cou-boon learning what it's like like having challenges and struggles because the space station is 250 miles away it's a four-hour trip if something bad happens on the space station it's reassuring knowing that there is a vehicle a Soyuz vehicle which is a Russian vehicle waiting there to take our crew members back to Earth if needed the moon is longer it's four-ish days to get back Mars that's even longer we're talking about months so it's prudent that we learn as much as we can but what it's like to live on a different planetary body like the moon before we try and get to Mars and that's what having sustained presence on the moon is all about the when when do you think you'll get assigned to a crew is it even noble so you know their critters are they have a difference between accidents and luck could you keep calling things accidents some of it sounds like it might be a little bit more luck some of it's luck that you made accidents I don't know I think I think what I'm trying to point out is that there wasn't a plan God not a plan at all I mean plan for me was just I like to told you all I wanted to be was a seal I had no idea no aspirations to be a physician to be an astronaut I just want one goal at a time that's really important to me even to this day that you have one singular goal because you should be all in and what you're doing you should be genuine in what you're doing not have some social climbing some some professional ladder that you're trying to meet these goals and be stepping stones and why I said accidents because I didn't want to be a corpsman in fact I wanted to be an intelligent specialist because the sounded cool or an operation I had no idea what an IS or an OS which is the rating for those to job didn't I just sounded cool so I've met a bit on the the the the Saturn or weaker side of the gray man but work up you you know as the as the guy that was running it the only people that kind of that showed up on my radar a lot where people that were having problems and you didn't show up on radar as having problems you were pretty much could do everything I mean what I appreciated about the teams was that it was a true meritocracy you got out of it what you put in and my original fears of being the menic of being boxed into just that responsibility because I wanted to do more I wanted to be the best asset I could be to my patreon to to my brothers and I quickly fell under the mentorship of many other people on the batoon Chris Cal was the primary sniper navigator point man and new guys kind of get matched up to a person he was the person I got matched up to because I would eventually be groomed to take on his responsibilities so early on I got tasked with being like the assistant lead now and point man and sniper which eventually got to take on these roles more a primary leader and workup and also on the point man so that meant that responsibility meant so much to me and I wanted to practice and train and wake up early and make sure just because I didn't want to mess it up not for myself but because I felt I owed and I did owe that responsibility of doing a good job to my patreon hey I got to admit this is like furl he's like if I like slacker whatever like I don't I can't like mentally allow myself to wear the shirt he's like I can't cuz it's like I'm betraying the shirt for sure same but but he said something along the lines of you know when we were saying well it'd be good to do this job or that job or whatever and the conversation was going and he said something along the lines of well not everyone's going to be as lucky as you guys were because I think you know he was just trying to say be good for guys to be able to get another shit and he goes not everyone's going to be as lucky as you guys were then and I get what he was saying but like I had to I had to you know just detach a little bit because let's face it
