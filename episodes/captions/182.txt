[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 182.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:10] The insertion was flawless.
[00:00:13] We were in the wood line and on our way for a general area reconnaissance.
[00:00:18] This time we played it by the book, moving 10 minutes, then waiting 10 minutes.
[00:00:23] As we moved, I swear that I'd never run an eight-man team again.
[00:00:28] It was too cumbersome.
[00:00:31] In this target, the vegetation still made me a tad on edge as it had a second canopy in some
[00:00:37] areas, but still gave us long lines of sight, something we weren't used to.
[00:00:43] As darkness approached, we looked for a good spot to R-O-N.
[00:00:48] With the flat terrain, finding a good R-O-N became really dicey.
[00:00:52] Alternatively, we'd look for high ground, dense vegetation, or an area far from any trail.
[00:00:58] Finally we found one, and saw a set up perimeter, set up the watch rotation, and oversaw
[00:01:03] the placement of extra clay more minds.
[00:01:07] In one area where the vegetation was thin, bubble placed a couple of toe poppers in the
[00:01:11] ground.
[00:01:13] I couldn't sleep.
[00:01:15] The flat terrain played on my mind.
[00:01:18] Our first light, the entire team, was awake, alert, retrieving the clay more minds and preparing
[00:01:22] for our move out of the R-O-N.
[00:01:26] After night on the jungle floor, I wanted an R-N-R anywhere with firm beds, clean sheets,
[00:01:33] and cold drinks.
[00:01:35] Because I insisted on carrying the PRC-25, there was little room in my backpack, except
[00:01:41] for essentials.
[00:01:43] At night, when I slept on the ground, I did so without an air mattress or hammock.
[00:01:49] The sole item of comfort was an Army-issue pullover sweater that buttoned up to the neck.
[00:01:55] Whenever I put it on at night, I was always worried about Charlie hitting us when I was pulling
[00:02:01] the sweater over my head.
[00:02:02] It was one of the few creature comforts I allowed myself or had room for in my Rucksack.
[00:02:09] Shortly after first light, the green Hornets CNC aircraft flew into the edge of our
[00:02:13] AO for a routine commo check.
[00:02:16] I gave him a quick team, OK, and prepared to move the team out of the R-O-N.
[00:02:22] However the CNC crew told me to wrap up the mission.
[00:02:25] There was another problem that he couldn't discuss on an open frequency.
[00:02:28] We knew the NVA monitored Saga FM radio transmissions and had radio direction finding
[00:02:32] equipment.
[00:02:34] The CNC pilot told us to find an LZ and let him know when we'd be ready for extra
[00:02:39] action.
[00:02:40] A few minutes later, the green Hornets roared into the new LZ picked us up and returned
[00:02:45] us to base.
[00:02:47] The reason we were yanked from the field this time stemmed from a tragedy in the Prairie
[00:02:51] Fryer area of operations on 30 November.
[00:02:56] An H-34 King B was shot out of the sky during an eldest son operation.
[00:03:01] Seven green berets from FOB-1 and FOB-4 were killed when an anti-aircraft round struck
[00:03:07] the Sakuarski chopper and ignited the ammunition on the aircraft killing everyone on board.
[00:03:16] One of the men killed and that ill-fated King B was staff sergeant Arthur E. Bader.
[00:03:23] I liked Bader.
[00:03:25] On my last night at FOB-1 before shipping out to FOB-6, I played in a poker game where
[00:03:31] he won a lot of money.
[00:03:34] Along with we played the more money Bader, the more money Bader, the more merouse he became.
[00:03:43] At one point, I asked him what was wrong.
[00:03:46] He was winning and he was a head several hundred dollars but kept complaining that he'd
[00:03:51] never spend the money.
[00:03:54] His response was that he had a premonition that he was going to die and that men about
[00:04:00] to die often went a lot of money that they would never spend.
[00:04:06] We all tried to josh him out of his dark mood but failed.
[00:04:10] Bader was a unique special forces green beret.
[00:04:15] He had earned and lost three separate fortunes in between three terms in the service.
[00:04:20] He was in his 30s but still enjoyed SF, spoke fluid German and a few other languages
[00:04:26] and merely wanted to accomplish any mission assigned to him.
[00:04:31] On the long flight back to Fubai, I kept hearing him talk to us at the poker table that
[00:04:37] last night.
[00:04:40] Now he was gone.
[00:04:49] And that is the reality of war captured in the best selling book across the fence.
[00:05:02] And back with us again to talk about war as the author of that book and of another book
[00:05:08] called On the Ground and of a series of books called the Sog Chronicles of Man who has
[00:05:12] seen more than most and who has had more close calls than any man should have John Stryker
[00:05:22] Meyer.
[00:05:23] And if you haven't listened to podcast 180 and 180 one yet go back and listen to them first
[00:05:30] to hear the background of this hero, this warrior special forces soldier and leader of
[00:05:37] RT Idaho, a recon team for Mac Vsog working missions across the border from Vietnam
[00:05:45] into Laos and Cambodia.
[00:05:47] John, good evening sir.
[00:05:49] Good evening.
[00:05:50] Thanks for coming back again.
[00:05:51] Glad to be back every time you walk out of the studio about 10 minutes later.
[00:05:54] I said if you were in tech say hey can you come back again next week?
[00:05:58] We said so much fun.
[00:05:59] I can't say no.
[00:06:00] That's happened.
[00:06:01] That's that happened.
[00:06:02] That's how you ended up here again every time you walk out of here I go.
[00:06:05] I want to hear you talk more.
[00:06:08] Hear more about what you've done.
[00:06:10] And yeah, no it's been awesome and there are spots where people have been hit me up.
[00:06:14] They've been just just in fraught with what you've been talking about and here in
[00:06:22] Utah these stories has been interesting.
[00:06:26] You haven't seen this.
[00:06:27] Have you heard of a movie character named Jason Born?
[00:06:31] Have you heard of this guy?
[00:06:33] Yeah.
[00:06:34] So I posted a picture of you when you were 21 or 21 or 22.
[00:06:37] Right.
[00:06:38] He's my illegitimate son.
[00:06:40] Yeah.
[00:06:41] You got some definite comments about that.
[00:06:44] Interesting.
[00:06:45] Interesting.
[00:06:46] So yeah, we got the real guy back again.
[00:06:50] So I know we that first excerpt that I just read was from across the fence and I wanted
[00:06:58] to go back to your other book for a little bit, the book on the ground and then I just
[00:07:05] want to kind of bunch of things I want to just ask you about and talk to you about.
[00:07:08] But I wanted to cover one more section of this book on the ground.
[00:07:11] I was reading through it again yesterday and it's just again one of these situations
[00:07:16] where I don't know how you're here right now to be honest with you.
[00:07:22] Only buddy Grace and guys indeed to be con guys to smother our team and you guys had more
[00:07:30] than 100% casualties right.
[00:07:33] Correct.
[00:07:34] You had guys that you had some guys that had 789 purple hearts.
[00:07:39] Bob Howard was putting for 11.
[00:07:41] He only received 8.
[00:07:43] In my case I've been putting for two more.
[00:07:45] But it's just straplish.
[00:07:46] Now you look at guys that get to a legs blown off on arms plump.
[00:07:49] It's like almost embarrassed to take it.
[00:07:52] And anybody got a purple heart in our day, you got really ragged for it.
[00:07:58] Because you dumbass, you just couldn't get out of the way fast enough.
[00:08:01] You got a purple tart.
[00:08:03] I think we had one of my old Vietnam seal buddies.
[00:08:06] I think he called it the Viet Cong Achievement Medal.
[00:08:10] That's a good one.
[00:08:11] I like that.
[00:08:15] So you're putting for two more?
[00:08:17] How many did you get already?
[00:08:18] That was ten one.
[00:08:19] Okay.
[00:08:20] And again, spider parks and Pat Walkins, my you know, my gurus, my recon gurus.
[00:08:26] We had one that had been put in for it.
[00:08:28] Just minor straplish the paperwork disappeared.
[00:08:32] Another one had more straplish.
[00:08:34] And this time with a little bit, a lot more serious bleeding and scratching and stuff.
[00:08:38] A little blood.
[00:08:39] But I think serious compared to what guys for sure.
[00:08:41] They really get hammered.
[00:08:42] They said no, put in for it.
[00:08:44] Some day you may have to go to the VA.
[00:08:47] Right.
[00:08:48] Even though the benefits, it's there.
[00:08:51] You get home loans.
[00:08:52] Oh, okay.
[00:08:53] It might be a future.
[00:08:54] If we get through this, it might be a future.
[00:08:56] Something that still gets a huge 20.
[00:08:58] Did it go to Vietnam after three purple hearts?
[00:09:00] Was that a rule?
[00:09:01] No.
[00:09:02] That's not a not a sock.
[00:09:03] That might be a normal.
[00:09:04] What about a normal soldier?
[00:09:06] I wouldn't know.
[00:09:07] I never spent any time in a regular unit.
[00:09:09] Yeah, no.
[00:09:10] I mean Bob Howard, he took his eight.
[00:09:13] And he sort of had eleven.
[00:09:15] All the clusters.
[00:09:16] They guess they've read out a clusters for those.
[00:09:18] Yeah, and you talk about in saw Chronicles while you're one, what was it?
[00:09:22] 16 guys went out, 16 special forces soldiers went out, and they got 33 purple hearts
[00:09:27] in four days.
[00:09:28] Oh, yeah.
[00:09:29] And probably go to gotten more.
[00:09:31] Sure.
[00:09:32] Ridiculous.
[00:09:33] Absolutely.
[00:09:34] It's crazy.
[00:09:35] Yeah.
[00:09:36] All right.
[00:09:37] We're going back to on the ground.
[00:09:40] Here we go.
[00:09:41] The Huey's lifted off made a general lazy turn and pointed their noses northwest.
[00:09:45] Once everyone was settled, I allowed my mind to wander as I looked out in Marford, and
[00:09:49] how beautiful the landscape was from several thousand feet up in the air, up where it was
[00:09:54] open and cool rather than closed in muggy.
[00:09:58] There was also a sense of inner peace and pride.
[00:10:01] This is what I had volunteered and trained so hard for.
[00:10:04] This chance to run top-secret missions behind enemy lines, dangerous missions that made
[00:10:08] a difference.
[00:10:10] Like most special forces types, I couldn't stomach the monotonous routines of camp life.
[00:10:15] The ash and trash detail stuff, the petty rules, regulations, formations, and egos.
[00:10:25] More amazing yet.
[00:10:26] Here I was at the ripe old age of 22, sporting the exalted rank of E4 and the one zero
[00:10:32] of a sog recon team.
[00:10:36] 22 years old.
[00:10:38] Young and dumb.
[00:10:42] Yeah.
[00:10:43] 22 years old.
[00:10:44] You've been busted.
[00:10:45] If you hadn't been budged, you got busted down once or twice.
[00:10:48] Only once.
[00:10:49] So you would have been an E5 you think at this point?
[00:10:51] I would have been up most of the power for yes, at least an E5.
[00:10:57] That must have been crazy.
[00:10:59] Because usually you got promoted based on, if you run a missions, whenever the appropriate
[00:11:04] time frame was, to be in one grade before you be considered for the next, sagging was really
[00:11:09] good about getting the promotions, at least our people were.
[00:11:11] So as soon as you'd accomplish your time in rank, you get out of me, do you?
[00:11:15] Do you get out of me, do you?
[00:11:16] For a really quick.
[00:11:20] So when you, this idea of being an SF and just being on camp and on base and having the
[00:11:30] normal kind of routines, you just couldn't stand that.
[00:11:34] No.
[00:11:35] Yes, would rather be out in the field.
[00:11:36] Oh, yeah, it's just trash and nuts.
[00:11:41] Okay.
[00:11:42] All right.
[00:11:43] Here we go back to the book.
[00:11:44] I had been with RTI to hope for seven months now.
[00:11:47] By the end of hard work, lots of mission experience and simply having survived, I was
[00:11:51] now a team leader.
[00:11:52] At a moment's notice, I could have millions of millions of dollars worth of air support
[00:11:56] assets, some of the man by majors and lieutenant kernels, all doing my bidding, all giving
[00:12:02] their courageous best to save my bacon.
[00:12:04] I'd come a long way since flunking out a college and doing a stint as a garbage collector
[00:12:08] in the Ocembary National Park.
[00:12:12] My egotistical reveries were cut short when the door gunner on my side of the Huey decided
[00:12:16] to cut loose with a long burst of M60 machine gun fire right next to my ear.
[00:12:21] Fortunately, he was simply test firing it.
[00:12:25] You know, we would get, I guess, kind of similar is we'd be driving to a target, right,
[00:12:30] being in a home V. You know, sometimes the targets are an hour, sometimes two hours.
[00:12:34] You know, we did some long, long transit.
[00:12:37] But you would get time to sit there and think about stuff because, well, you're sitting
[00:12:44] there being transport, there's not too much you can do.
[00:12:47] You know, you're scanned and you're looking for, but you're in a helicopter, there's
[00:12:51] nothing to do, but think really.
[00:12:52] It was always amazing because it's just so beautiful.
[00:12:56] I mean, southeast Asia from the air, even when you went over a combat zone, you see
[00:13:00] the bomb creators and you, but the jungle was just, just beautiful country.
[00:13:07] And then you get to under it and get into the underbell of the jungle that's like, you
[00:13:11] know, it's another whole world.
[00:13:13] The Starling contrast, you know?
[00:13:15] And like if you're in the desert, it has this own beauty.
[00:13:19] And it can be spell binding if you just watch it with a while, look at this, without realizing
[00:13:24] the somewhere, there's a little hole, some guy can pop out up and hit you with an RPG or
[00:13:29] detonate in your case.
[00:13:31] Does it smoke controls?
[00:13:32] Yeah.
[00:13:33] When you roll over.
[00:13:35] Did you, it sounds like you recognize this when you were doing these operations, you
[00:13:41] kind of knew that this was, I don't know, I guess I'm going to use this word.
[00:13:49] You were lucky to be there.
[00:13:50] Oh, clearly, because I won 100% when I was in Iraq and I only did two to pull on this
[00:13:57] to Iraq, I won 100% new every day that I was there.
[00:14:02] I knew that this was like my time, this is what I'd been, this is what I would lived
[00:14:10] for.
[00:14:11] And I knew that.
[00:14:12] It wasn't like I looked back and say, I wouldn't really wish I would have appreciated
[00:14:14] those days.
[00:14:15] No, when I was in them, I completely knew it and appreciated being there, like every
[00:14:20] single day.
[00:14:21] Yeah.
[00:14:22] And I, it was a nice feeling personally to think that, here we are, we're the best
[00:14:30] and we're running the missions and that's what we live for.
[00:14:34] Okay, now we're here, let's go do this and just hope to get the mission done and just
[00:14:42] wish the Dan track, or so leave your lungs, you get the mission done.
[00:14:44] Good do to our tapers, naturopio, W. Something like that.
[00:14:48] Oh, yeah, it felt good, but you know, it's like quiet professionals, just don't talk
[00:14:52] about that much.
[00:14:53] Yeah.
[00:14:54] Going back to the book as we approached the LZ, the team crowded the two doors of
[00:15:00] the helicopter.
[00:15:01] I was on the right half standing on the skid.
[00:15:03] Sau was kneeling behind me as hand on my shoulder ready to follow me out the door.
[00:15:07] Next to him was, hip, my one-one, John Bubba, sure, along with fuck our point man and
[00:15:13] Tuan are Grenadier, got ready to exit out the left side door.
[00:15:17] We all kept her eyes riveted on the looming jungle, scanning for any signs of movement
[00:15:21] in the tree lines surrounding our LZ.
[00:15:24] The top of the triple canopy growth of trees, vines and other vegetation was at least
[00:15:29] 100 feet off the jungle floor and the opening into which we were descending reminded me of
[00:15:33] the mouth of a long dark tunnel at the bottom of which resided things, Alice never dreamed
[00:15:39] of when she tumbled into that rabbit hole of hers.
[00:15:42] As we were swallowed up and the darkness increased, a cold chill ran down my spine.
[00:15:53] When you're going into these spots, so you had pre-identified this LZ prior to.
[00:15:58] Is that correct?
[00:15:59] At that point, we were working with Kavi at Dornner Briefing.
[00:16:04] We would give out the official LZs, the primary secondary alternate and that would go to
[00:16:12] Saigon.
[00:16:13] Then we whispered as you're finding something else because we knew that there was a little
[00:16:18] scrubbed.
[00:16:19] And then, so by finding something else, you're basically just looking for a clearing of
[00:16:23] some kind of general within that target and usually to be somewhere as else they go.
[00:16:28] And somewhere as we were Saigon, the leak there wouldn't get the word back because we had
[00:16:33] that one target.
[00:16:34] We went in with the bomb.
[00:16:36] The LZ was little, he wired.
[00:16:38] And the top security had wire already with a 500 pounder.
[00:16:42] So we were beginning to do that much more often than.
[00:16:45] Could we had great cubbies?
[00:16:47] They knew what we did.
[00:16:48] The cubbies fly the area of operations before you inserted.
[00:16:52] Like the AB4 or anything like that?
[00:16:54] Well, Dornner Day up, they would just fly over it.
[00:16:56] Sure.
[00:16:57] Is this picture or anything?
[00:16:59] No.
[00:17:00] No.
[00:17:01] Usually they would just do a VR visual reconnaissance and they would try to be subtle about
[00:17:06] like in early 68, we always flew a visual reconnaissance prior to the mission.
[00:17:11] And the NVA is not stupid.
[00:17:14] If they see a bird dog flying over a target, they figure well, pretty soon we're going
[00:17:17] to get visitors and sure enough.
[00:17:20] So like gave them time to get ready.
[00:17:22] So we basically cut out the VRs on our part.
[00:17:27] And then when cubbie go out, you know, a lot of guys have been flying.
[00:17:31] They're more familiar with the VR with the helicopter.
[00:17:35] Oh no, no.
[00:17:36] Usually with South Vietnamese Air Force, they have a little 01 just like from World War
[00:17:42] 2.
[00:17:43] The one from the battle from the bulls were heavy fondant's up there in the right seat.
[00:17:47] And the power's cut, this little cub, the piper cup is going 88 miles an hour.
[00:17:51] Top speed downhill.
[00:17:53] Yeah.
[00:17:54] And that's what, and so that would be most of our VRs.
[00:17:58] But then by Christmas, we pretty much cut that out.
[00:18:03] And that just because they were, that was given away.
[00:18:06] We used to ride on logistics air and kind of move the logistics air a little bit to
[00:18:11] over an air that we were going over.
[00:18:13] So no one would know that we were in there, that we were taking pictures, you know, like
[00:18:19] just logistics air, just an aircraft flying somewhere, they'd go in a straight line.
[00:18:23] They wouldn't, they'd just veer off a little bit so we could see what we wanted to see.
[00:18:27] Sure.
[00:18:28] And then also the fake ill fake inserts.
[00:18:32] Sometimes they didn't have the fuel to do a lot fake inserts.
[00:18:35] But they had the device called the nightingale where they would go in to a nightingale
[00:18:41] often pull the detonator on it.
[00:18:44] And it was sound like a firefight.
[00:18:47] So that would have a lot of commotion.
[00:18:49] And then they would jump up, go to a second LZ and put a send.
[00:18:53] And down south, we were with the green hornets.
[00:18:56] They really had it cold, because it was flat, down, up, down, up.
[00:19:01] So if the NV, we're trying to guess which of the three of four touchdowns where we were,
[00:19:05] they were really busy.
[00:19:07] Got it.
[00:19:08] Going back to the book as the chopper near the jungle floor, Bubba and I executed our first
[00:19:13] and standard operating procedure, which was checking the LZ for trip wires or booby traps while
[00:19:17] the rest of the team searched the surrounding jungle for any signs of trouble.
[00:19:21] After giving the all clear, the team was out the doors and all in the ground before the
[00:19:24] skids firmly touched down.
[00:19:26] How long would you hover there and look at the LZ for?
[00:19:29] Oh, not long.
[00:19:30] Like a matter of ten seconds.
[00:19:31] Just like you got to go in, touch down, get out.
[00:19:34] Sure.
[00:19:35] Yeah, we used to just jump out, lay down.
[00:19:37] Like the helicopter would just touch and take off.
[00:19:40] It would just jump out, lay down right there.
[00:19:42] We wouldn't move away from it.
[00:19:43] Just jump out, lay down.
[00:19:44] Modern day version of touching gun.
[00:19:46] Yeah.
[00:19:47] Yeah.
[00:19:48] We quickly headed into the wood line and set up a provisional perimeter where we could wait and
[00:19:51] listen.
[00:19:53] When again, we saw and heard nothing suspicious.
[00:19:55] We burrow deeper into the jungle where it was both dancer and darker.
[00:19:58] Like some furative predatory animal, we were looking to hide ourselves.
[00:20:03] After ten minutes of no threatening sounds or movements, I radioed Covey and gave him the
[00:20:07] message he had been waiting to hear.
[00:20:09] Team OK.
[00:20:11] He and others could take up breathing again, at least for the time being.
[00:20:16] The deeper we moved in, the deeper we moved the darker and more claustrophobic things
[00:20:21] became.
[00:20:22] Moving through the foliage was an excruciatingly slow and painful process with sweat stinging
[00:20:27] one's eyes, bugs crawling and feasting upon exposed skin and visibility cut to mere feet.
[00:20:35] It could be also be disorienting, especially when the maps we were given were so useless.
[00:20:41] And here was RT Idaho looking for fuel lines, some bright eyed Covey rider had spotted
[00:20:46] and directed aerostracks against.
[00:20:49] Intelligence reports said there was a second pipeline in this A.O. as well, regardless
[00:20:54] of how many any pipeline we found we were going to destroy.
[00:20:59] What were the maps?
[00:21:00] Were you one to 50 maps?
[00:21:01] Is that what you had?
[00:21:02] Yeah.
[00:21:03] One to 50,000?
[00:21:04] Right.
[00:21:05] But they would cut out from the big map.
[00:21:07] They would cut out like a 10 by 10 or 12 by 12 square so that if we were killed, they came
[00:21:13] across the map to be no other intel on a separate at one target area that we were on
[00:21:17] the ground.
[00:21:18] Now, I've gone into triple canopy jungle before with what he ever had as you know,
[00:21:23] one to 24 map.
[00:21:25] They're basically more detailed.
[00:21:27] Yes.
[00:21:28] Their twice as detailed and they're pretty good, but one to 50s are not that accurate.
[00:21:32] No.
[00:21:33] We had that one target where they had forgotten a mountain.
[00:21:37] You know, we're on a mountain.
[00:21:38] We're getting ready to go down the go over and we look at it.
[00:21:41] It's like, hey, they forgot one.
[00:21:43] It's not really good.
[00:21:44] Stretch your mission out when you're in triple canopy.
[00:21:48] Cluster phobic.
[00:21:49] You use that word cluster phobic quite a bit in this section.
[00:21:53] Is this jungle just tight?
[00:21:56] Very.
[00:21:57] Yeah, because again, sometimes you had to keep sight on the guy in front of you as you
[00:22:01] moved because he just becomes separated so easily.
[00:22:06] Because of the dense vegetation, of course, a lot of times our Vietnamese were shorter.
[00:22:12] They could get through a quick.
[00:22:13] Well, we would be down on our knees.
[00:22:15] I wore out more pants crawling through the jungle.
[00:22:18] I know, I saw a picture.
[00:22:20] I was looking at the pictures in the books.
[00:22:21] I saw a picture.
[00:22:22] One of the images is that some of those guys were really small.
[00:22:24] Oh, yeah.
[00:22:25] Really small.
[00:22:26] 98 pounds, so can wet.
[00:22:27] But 50 pounds are hard.
[00:22:29] That's awesome.
[00:22:32] All right, I go back to the book.
[00:22:34] But I had more immediate and pressing concerns.
[00:22:36] The adrenaline rush that always accompanied an insertion had pretty much worn off.
[00:22:40] And another characteristic sensation had begun to take its place.
[00:22:44] It was a feeling of familiarity and comfort combined with an e-resensitive for boating.
[00:22:49] Both were a product of experience.
[00:22:52] I was comfortable because I was surrounded by extraordinary, well-trained and fiercely
[00:22:56] devoted team that knew what it was doing.
[00:23:00] Yet we also had stepped in enough accidental shit and had encountered so many hostile
[00:23:06] enemy units that it was impossible to not feel serious anxiety.
[00:23:11] In fact, I figured that when I stopped being scared, shitless, I would be on my way to
[00:23:16] buying the farm.
[00:23:19] Cochines had cost more than one life.
[00:23:24] But you still get that little mixed feeling of comfort, but fear and anxiety at the same
[00:23:30] time.
[00:23:31] Yes.
[00:23:32] You know, the whole adrenaline of the e-mail is, you get a certain, you're just pumped.
[00:23:37] And at some point you get off and get on the ground.
[00:23:40] It's just because you guys would hit so many times you would insert immediately get contacted.
[00:23:44] A lot of times, yeah.
[00:23:46] So once you be amped up going in and then when there's nothing there, that starts to fade.
[00:23:52] Yeah, then you finally get on the ground, it's like, oh, at last, we're on the ground.
[00:23:56] Now, let's get on with the mission.
[00:23:59] We're about to trackers.
[00:24:00] Let's get moving.
[00:24:01] But let's also stay cognizant.
[00:24:03] Could it keep our situational awareness tight?
[00:24:07] And that, you know, this is one of the reasons I highlighted this section is, you know,
[00:24:13] just this is something that, you know, what we talk about complacency all the time.
[00:24:16] I know there was a board of Marine Corps units we were with the three eight and
[00:24:21] a body, they had a, that aside, that signs around their compound complacency kills.
[00:24:25] Yeah.
[00:24:26] For sure.
[00:24:27] But this idea of, and you know, I also talk to young military guys, young seals, that,
[00:24:35] you know, they're, they're scared of this, they're scared of that.
[00:24:37] That's like, I always tell them, good, you know, you should, you should be afraid.
[00:24:40] Because if you're afraid, you're going to prepare more, you're going to train harbor, you're
[00:24:43] going to, you're not going to cut any corners, you're not going to get complacent.
[00:24:47] And that's the same thing that you're saying here is you'd seen cockiness, cost people
[00:24:52] their lives because they think, oh, we can just get away with whatever.
[00:24:55] Yeah, if you're not scared, I'm scared of you.
[00:24:57] Really?
[00:24:58] Yeah.
[00:24:59] Yeah.
[00:25:00] And then you have to overcome that though, because you can't let that get, get control.
[00:25:06] And you were talking before we started recording, we were talking about a guy that was in
[00:25:09] a firefight and there was one guy that didn't fire a shot, stayed curled up in a ball,
[00:25:13] praying.
[00:25:14] Yeah.
[00:25:15] That's when that's when fear is not, not your friend.
[00:25:19] Yeah, our guys wanted to shoot him.
[00:25:26] So you got a balance that, you got to have the fear, you got to feel it, but you got
[00:25:29] to deal with it.
[00:25:30] Correct.
[00:25:34] We had compasses.
[00:25:36] So we knew the general direction we were headed, which was to the northwest away from
[00:25:39] the LZ.
[00:25:40] We had been working our way slowly through the underbrush for about an hour when suddenly
[00:25:43] we heard an explosion behind us.
[00:25:46] It had to have been the Claymore bubble rig to go off if anyone tried to follow us off
[00:25:50] the LZ.
[00:25:51] It's detonation, singled, signaled a profound change in the situation.
[00:25:56] The hunters were about to become the hunted.
[00:26:00] In the jungle, there are almost always animal noises of some kind and these suddenly
[00:26:05] fell silent.
[00:26:07] In the quiet, we could hear some distressing sounds to the west, sounds that were not
[00:26:12] of a jungle kind, but those of men on the move we were not alone.
[00:26:22] Welcome to the jungle, baby.
[00:26:26] Yes indeed.
[00:26:28] How do you know that the Claymore's that you rigged weren't set off by some kind of monkey
[00:26:34] or whatever, some kind of animal?
[00:26:36] Would you guys rig a certain way that that was unlikely?
[00:26:41] The way bubble and the Frenchman later would do it in Lin.
[00:26:45] They would put it in an area where it would be easiest for the trackers to follow.
[00:26:50] So you'd just based on human nature.
[00:26:52] You're going to go through this.
[00:26:53] Take part, you're going to go where it's easier to travel.
[00:26:56] And it could have been an animal.
[00:26:58] But basically it's an NVA animal.
[00:27:02] Yeah.
[00:27:04] The coincidence would be too much and the chances are it's just NVA.
[00:27:08] And if it is a monkey as opposed to an NVA, we'll find that out within the next couple
[00:27:13] hours.
[00:27:14] On the other hand, let's get ready.
[00:27:17] And there was an enemy moving in the jungle.
[00:27:21] The animals would stop making noises.
[00:27:24] It all depends how close they were.
[00:27:26] But yes, lots of, that's why the most important thing in the jungle was listening.
[00:27:30] Yeah.
[00:27:31] I mean, 10 and 10 sounds pretty extreme.
[00:27:33] But it really gives you time to hear what's going on.
[00:27:38] Because you're a lot of time, you can't see it.
[00:27:40] That's the best sense in the jungle.
[00:27:42] Like I said, I've been in Triple Canopy and we've done Patrol and in Triple Canopy.
[00:27:45] And you could hit by monkeys too, right?
[00:27:47] Yeah.
[00:27:48] We had monkeys freak us out.
[00:27:51] But that the sense just so people can understand, you can only see it in that thick jungle.
[00:27:57] Sometimes you can only see five feet.
[00:27:59] Sure.
[00:28:00] Five or ten feet at the most.
[00:28:01] So you patrol for 10 minutes and then you just stop everyone is quiet and you listen
[00:28:07] to see if anyone's following you to see if there's any other movement out there.
[00:28:10] That's what you're doing.
[00:28:11] Sure.
[00:28:12] I mean, and it's so thick that if I'm behind a point man or sometimes it would be a point
[00:28:18] man was sal and myself.
[00:28:21] Why would never see a point man?
[00:28:22] I would just keep an eye on sal and the guy behind me would just be on my backpack.
[00:28:27] I wouldn't, I couldn't tell you where the point man was.
[00:28:30] I just follow sal and the vegetation was that thick a lot of times.
[00:28:34] And again, I'm depending on the Vietnamese because they know they didn't have a jungle
[00:28:43] better to make.
[00:28:44] How come the animals would stop making noise?
[00:28:46] Would the animal stop making noise when you would patrol?
[00:28:48] I would assume.
[00:28:50] But once we settle down, things would come back normal.
[00:28:53] So when you stop moving, then the sounds would escalate.
[00:28:56] And if they didn't have to 10 minutes ago, the puck of faker tightens up to a little
[00:29:01] little bit more.
[00:29:06] I immediately signaled Falk, who is on point to head north.
[00:29:13] This would take us up a hill that dominated our right flank.
[00:29:15] The climb was pretty severe, which was good and bad news.
[00:29:19] Well, it made the going rough at all so meant we were gaining some genuine high ground
[00:29:23] and high ground is the preferred position when it comes to defense.
[00:29:26] The steepness also meant the enemy would have to work as hard as we were.
[00:29:30] I couldn't tell how close the NVA trackers were or how many of them were headed our way.
[00:29:35] But I knew if push came to shove, I wanted to be looking down on them.
[00:29:40] Always take the high ground.
[00:29:42] Always.
[00:29:43] That's just military maximum.
[00:29:46] And you know, I actually say you take the moral high ground as well.
[00:29:50] Take the high ground to take you.
[00:29:52] Amen.
[00:29:54] When we reach the hilltop, just as dark clouds unleashed the torrent of rain.
[00:30:00] While Bubba and Sau began setting out a perimeter of claymores, I contacted Covey and
[00:30:05] appraised him of the situation, namely that it didn't look good and that we might be calling
[00:30:08] for an immediate extraction before nightfall.
[00:30:11] Did you guys speak at all?
[00:30:13] Only minimal, because most of it would be hand-saint-looking.
[00:30:16] Just everything, as you can see.
[00:30:18] Estrogationally, you'd have to whisper near.
[00:30:21] But if we just void it as much as we could.
[00:30:24] But something like this, just so people understand, something like this, you're on patrol.
[00:30:28] You're not saying anything.
[00:30:30] You head up the hill, you don't say anything.
[00:30:32] You get to perimeter, you give the perimeter signal, you don't say anything.
[00:30:35] Everyone knows what to do when you're in there.
[00:30:36] You could go days out in the field without talking.
[00:30:39] Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:30:40] Because with the training, as a pushe, you got the visual with the person that you're
[00:30:45] signaling.
[00:30:46] Like, in my case, if I'm behind fuck the point, man, I'm telling him what to do and I'll
[00:30:50] turn around, tell the guy behind me, same signals, and then we go.
[00:30:54] Yeah.
[00:30:54] While I was talking to Covey, SAU who had moved north to set out as Claymore suddenly opened
[00:31:03] fire on full automatic, a sure sign we had visitors.
[00:31:07] This was immediately confirmed when heavy AK-47 fire ripped out of the jungle in response.
[00:31:12] In less than five seconds, the well-practiced SAU had fired off all 18 rounds in his car
[00:31:18] 15, set off the claymores and reloaded his weapon while falling back to join the rest
[00:31:23] of the team.
[00:31:24] That's legit right there.
[00:31:26] SAU was making things happen.
[00:31:28] He was the man.
[00:31:30] Would you guys be trained in these immediate action drills, mag changes?
[00:31:34] I mean, everything that we do, right?
[00:31:35] You guys drill that stuff.
[00:31:36] Every drill in drill in drill.
[00:31:37] If we're in camp, we go down often.
[00:31:42] Just particularly in the beginning, through June, my first couple of months, whenever
[00:31:46] every day, hundreds of rounds.
[00:31:48] And when this happens, these guys are called.
[00:31:51] The enemy is very close to you because you can at least know that they're there.
[00:31:56] They've got to be what?
[00:31:57] 15, 20, maybe 30 meters away.
[00:32:00] In that case here, I forget how close they weren't that far for SAU to blow his claymore
[00:32:05] and the car 15 and reload and do it one more time.
[00:32:11] Back to the book.
[00:32:12] Bird the background shots and explosions, so he was not overly surprised when I stated
[00:32:16] the obvious.
[00:32:18] We had a prairie fire emergency in progress and we wanted out ASAP.
[00:32:22] The mission was over.
[00:32:23] The fuel lines would have to wait until another day.
[00:32:25] The focus now became saving our asses.
[00:32:28] To this end, every air sat with air sat with in striking distance would immediately be
[00:32:34] vector to our target area.
[00:32:36] The odds would soon turn.
[00:32:38] If not necessarily in our favor, very decidedly against the enemy.
[00:32:42] RTI to ho might not make it out alive, but neither would the NVA.
[00:32:53] Guys had some serious confidence in that air power.
[00:32:56] Yeah, that was our lifeline.
[00:32:59] I mean, a major edge that we had and whenever we could use it, we'd use it because it was
[00:33:06] only matter time before they would get more bodies there and we had teams ahead been over
[00:33:11] run and 67, 68.
[00:33:15] So we knew the potential for things to go really wrong.
[00:33:18] That was one of the things that could neutralize the manpower.
[00:33:23] When they had the enemy had so many troops.
[00:33:25] Did teams ever get overrun while they had air power?
[00:33:28] Oh sure.
[00:33:30] Sadly, yes, we were.
[00:33:32] Yeah, they would just keep coming and is self-admetal honors recipients, Fred Zebattowski,
[00:33:39] Robert Howard, SF on admissions and they were directing air power.
[00:33:46] Still just got overrun.
[00:33:48] That's all part of the horror of being on the ground.
[00:33:51] We guess they really determined, Phil.
[00:33:53] So even though you have confidence in your air power, you know there's limitations.
[00:33:58] Yeah, if things really go bad, that air power is not going to be able to save you.
[00:34:04] Correct.
[00:34:05] And again, it's time, weather and where are you in the jungle?
[00:34:10] And a triple canopy, if you're in triple canopy, all you could do is maybe gun runs and
[00:34:14] you're not even sure how effective it'll be, but at least you get your attention.
[00:34:21] Going back to the book, call King Beast, call King Beast, Boku Vc, Boku Vc.
[00:34:26] It was clear, sound, and I shared similar praise of our situation and the same thoughts
[00:34:30] about what needed to be done.
[00:34:33] The only hitch was how to pull it off, what with darkness approaching a storm raging and
[00:34:37] no helicopters anywhere near us.
[00:34:40] I didn't want to add to either sounds or the team's angst, so I didn't share my misgivings.
[00:34:46] Instead, I gave Kovie the direction and probable distance we'd moved from the LZ and
[00:34:51] told him I was about to throw two yellow smoke grenades to mark a location.
[00:34:55] I threw two hoping some of the smoke would somehow travel up through the thick vegetation
[00:35:00] and into the clear where Kovie could see it.
[00:35:04] Kovie had good and bad news.
[00:35:07] He thought he had our location, but he doubted seriously if he could get extraction helicopters
[00:35:12] to us before nightfall.
[00:35:14] Not good, not good at all.
[00:35:17] We now had confirmed enemy north and south of us and they were closing in.
[00:35:23] South frantically signaled Bubba to set off the south facing Klamors when Bubba hesitated
[00:35:28] for a second.
[00:35:29] I could hear South his coat of Kovie-Dow-VC.
[00:35:32] How do you say that?
[00:35:34] Kovie-Dow-VC.
[00:35:35] Do you mean the misrecill?
[00:35:38] Duma, which is Vietnamese for mother, mother fuckers.
[00:35:47] As the Klamors erupted, South pulled the pin on the fragmentation grenade and lobbed it
[00:35:51] into the boiling dust and smoke even more enemy troops came up the slope.
[00:35:57] With my ears ringing from the blast, I thought I heard additional movement to the east,
[00:36:02] but I couldn't be sure.
[00:36:03] Because the NVA had abandoned any pretense of stealth, I soon verified they were coming
[00:36:09] from that flank as well.
[00:36:11] And there were lots of them.
[00:36:13] As these unseen forces maneuvered in for the kill, the jungle took on its most terrifying
[00:36:18] and claustrophobic reality.
[00:36:20] But a friendly place in the very best of circumstances, it was now about the worst place
[00:36:26] in the world to be.
[00:36:29] Again, that claustrophobic sense.
[00:36:33] Can you see the sky in the stripple canopy?
[00:36:38] Depends, sometimes you can see it glimpses of it or it would be a little opening.
[00:36:43] So he was able to see the smoke, sometimes you pop a yellow smoke, which is bright, and
[00:36:48] wouldn't even be able to get through.
[00:36:53] Everyone was cutting loose as fast as he could and effort to suppress the enemy's fire
[00:36:57] and drive him back.
[00:36:58] Twanted managed to find some narrow openings in the vegetation that were shooting rounds
[00:37:02] with his M79 grenade launcher.
[00:37:06] And suddenly the jungle went silent.
[00:37:07] As if someone had thrown a switch or hit the mute button, the only sounds were the metallic
[00:37:13] clicks as both RT Idaho and the NVA locked fresh magazines into their weapons.
[00:37:20] The fight was far from over.
[00:37:22] In fact, the party was just getting started and we were simply changing records for the
[00:37:27] next dance with death.
[00:37:29] The jungle again erupted with deafening roar of gunfire.
[00:37:37] So that's sketchy.
[00:37:38] That's got to be a horrifying feeling.
[00:37:40] Boom.
[00:37:41] That's why everyone dumps their mags.
[00:37:43] There's that moment of silence and then that silence, all you hear is reload happening.
[00:37:46] And you know too, when that happens, how when your adrenaline is pumping, when you're
[00:37:51] here, your time frame has expanded.
[00:37:55] So now instead of like, you just read it, that's a quick, it is bam bam, you're saying,
[00:37:59] but now, and then you're drowning, it feels like it's slowed down.
[00:38:02] You can feel the magazine coming out.
[00:38:04] You hear it click, click, everybody else is ramming them in.
[00:38:07] Come on, boys.
[00:38:08] Come down on this first and our guys won.
[00:38:12] With all the noise, I had to shove the radio handset, damn near, inside my ear to hear what
[00:38:18] Kofi was trying to tell me.
[00:38:20] The good news bad news routine continued.
[00:38:23] The good news was that some of the yellow smoke had finally made it, it's way to where
[00:38:26] Kofi could see it.
[00:38:28] But the bad news was we were nowhere near the NLZ.
[00:38:32] He wanted to know if we could fight our way back to where we had been inserted.
[00:38:36] Negative, I yelled as fuck, Bubba, and Hap all opened up on some NVA who had managed to sneak
[00:38:42] up from the south.
[00:38:43] There were green tracers whizzing all around me.
[00:38:47] Kofi would have to wait.
[00:38:48] And that's another good point because in this war, the enemy almost always had green
[00:38:54] tracers.
[00:38:55] Always.
[00:38:56] Okay.
[00:38:57] Yeah, for us, the enemy didn't always have green.
[00:38:58] They've had red.
[00:38:59] In fact, most of the time, well, a lot of times I had red.
[00:39:02] Because they had.
[00:39:03] Well, no kidding.
[00:39:04] Yeah.
[00:39:05] So it was, you know, they just got their ammo from all different sources.
[00:39:09] And so it wasn't just this, there wasn't just, hey, they're green and we're red.
[00:39:13] It was mostly red.
[00:39:15] Some green occasionally, but.
[00:39:17] Wow.
[00:39:18] Yeah.
[00:39:19] Yeah.
[00:39:20] Um.
[00:39:24] After helping repel the attack, I got back on the radio to impress upon Kofi, the direness of our
[00:39:30] straits.
[00:39:31] But of course, he already knew that.
[00:39:32] So in his convoyce, which could drive a one zero to a merger, he said, we don't have
[00:39:37] a lot of time.
[00:39:38] No shit.
[00:39:40] The only chance we have is about a hundred meters north by northeast from your location.
[00:39:43] There's a small hole in the roof, and we might be able to get strings down to you.
[00:39:47] He inquired if we had much activity to our north.
[00:39:50] It depended, I thought, on what you meant by much.
[00:39:53] And activity.
[00:39:55] I reminded him that north was where the whole shooting match got started and while the
[00:40:00] bullet, while I thought we had pretty much taken that group of NVA out of action, I couldn't
[00:40:05] be sure.
[00:40:06] When I finished, he said, don't worry.
[00:40:08] I have a pair of A1E's on station, and I'll have the leader make a gun run, and then
[00:40:13] give, and then have his wingmen follow with 500 pounders.
[00:40:18] Before I could say, Roger that the first guy radar roared across our northern perimeter,
[00:40:22] his 20 millimeter cannons blazing away.
[00:40:24] His wood chips dust and debris filled the air, the members of RTI Idaho did not need to
[00:40:30] be told what to do.
[00:40:32] We kissed mother earth and pressed against her body for all we were worth.
[00:40:37] In the brief quiet that followed, I told Bubba to pair some explosives.
[00:40:41] Just in case we needed to cut down trees at the extraction point.
[00:40:45] I told Sau, we needed to head north as that was our only chance for escape.
[00:40:49] No one looked happy with this news, particularly not Sau, who had seen first hand
[00:40:54] what was waiting in that direction.
[00:40:57] About this time, the second sky radar appeared and released its load of 500 pound bombs.
[00:41:03] They were so close that the concussions bounced us like jumping beans.
[00:41:11] And this is all based on the yellow smoke that you'd thrown five minutes ago or eight
[00:41:16] minutes ago.
[00:41:17] Right.
[00:41:18] They're looking at a massive, this is another thing that's hard to understand.
[00:41:22] I was a radio man when I was in New Guy and we were out in the desert and we were trying
[00:41:27] to call in helicopters to come pick us up.
[00:41:30] It's me calling him in.
[00:41:31] It's not weed.
[00:41:32] I'm sitting there on the radio trying to call in these helicopters.
[00:41:36] I got my air pan and we're in the desert.
[00:41:39] This isn't true because this is the desert and these helicopters can't see me.
[00:41:43] They're not far.
[00:41:44] They're not out to do.
[00:41:45] They're probably 500 to 500 meters away.
[00:41:48] They're doing an apathy earth or they're looking for us.
[00:41:52] They know we're in the general area and they're looking for us and I'm sitting there with
[00:41:54] a signal panel like trying to get their attention.
[00:41:58] And what you don't realize is that you're seeing this helicopter.
[00:42:03] It's so obvious.
[00:42:04] I mean, you'd think there's no possible way that they can't see you.
[00:42:07] You'd think there's no pop where you've got a 16 man seal puttune out there.
[00:42:12] I'm waving around a piece of fluorescent orange where the only human beings in this desert
[00:42:16] and they can't see us.
[00:42:18] And now you're in the reason they can't see us is because they're looking everywhere.
[00:42:22] They're looking at whatever.
[00:42:23] What however many square miles they're looking into and ocean.
[00:42:26] They're looking at the desert.
[00:42:27] They can see all this space.
[00:42:30] And so it takes them a while.
[00:42:31] You don't find that.
[00:42:32] I think I popped a smoke and they didn't see the smoke and then I popped another smoke.
[00:42:37] And so I can't imagine these guys are coming in hot, dropping bombs based on where the
[00:42:45] not even the him but where the covey saw smoke five minutes ago.
[00:42:51] Yeah.
[00:42:52] We may have popped another smoke in here somewhere and also I know that I had talked
[00:42:57] to covey.
[00:42:58] Okay, here's our smoke north of us and he knew they had we had a lot of I take north
[00:43:03] in south and if we got about maybe we'll be we're getting from the east but if we're
[00:43:08] talking about trying to get to the north that's why he came across the northern.
[00:43:12] So he knew basically where we were and he came in and it cost a 500 pounds of
[00:43:16] able to get through the jungle and impact on the ground.
[00:43:20] And those things rocked you guys.
[00:43:22] Oh yeah.
[00:43:23] That's one of those happy pains.
[00:43:29] Yeah.
[00:43:30] Good times I guess.
[00:43:33] Tilt.
[00:43:34] All right.
[00:43:36] With the A1E activity to occupy us we had momentarily taken our attention away from our
[00:43:42] southern flank and now a wave of NVA hit us from that direction.
[00:43:47] Everyone responded with automatic fire and Bubba and I lob some grenades down the slope.
[00:43:53] I informed covey of the attack and told him that when I gave the word and the team moved
[00:43:58] to the north I wanted more A1E runs to our south.
[00:44:02] In my heart of hearts I also wanted more runs to the north but we didn't have time for
[00:44:07] that.
[00:44:08] We had to get out while the getting was good.
[00:44:10] The next NVA wave could be the one to overrun us.
[00:44:20] As Bubba finished preparing explosives, Hep and I continued rolling grenades downhill
[00:44:25] toward the enemy.
[00:44:26] Saoen folk covered Tuan with car 15 fire as he set up a clay more facing south and covered
[00:44:32] it with leaves.
[00:44:33] A little parting gift for our friends.
[00:44:38] The race was on.
[00:44:39] I gave covey the word and behind us the A1E.
[00:44:42] The A1E is began bombing the shit out of whoever was back there.
[00:44:46] Folk angled back to the north.
[00:44:47] We passed the, we passed bodies of dead NVA soldiers but we didn't have time to stop and
[00:44:51] search them for papers or anything of an intelligence value.
[00:44:55] We had only one fought mind.
[00:44:58] Get out.
[00:44:59] It was something of a miracle that fawking Sao actually located the spot covey had found
[00:45:04] for us.
[00:45:05] When we finally looked up toward the whole itself however, it appeared a long, long ways
[00:45:10] away.
[00:45:11] It was at least a hundred feet or more and the green tunnel leading to it was narrow and
[00:45:15] dangerous.
[00:45:16] As we were approaching, I'd seen the tops of trees being whipped around by the gusting
[00:45:20] wind and knew this would complicate matters even more.
[00:45:24] This was not going to be an easy exit.
[00:45:26] So you guys are moving to this thing.
[00:45:27] You're looking up at the tree tops and you see there's like heavy wind.
[00:45:30] Because that's just a weather wind.
[00:45:32] Like it's wet.
[00:45:33] It's windy out.
[00:45:34] We had weather forecast and it might be some problems with the weather.
[00:45:39] So here we are as dark and I didn't tell the guys.
[00:45:43] I knew that seeing those trees like that, this was a little bit.
[00:45:48] And I was getting late dark.
[00:45:50] I needed your nugs.
[00:45:52] Yeah, you did.
[00:45:53] I wish you could have had them bro.
[00:45:55] And we're going to totally change this whole scenario.
[00:45:57] Because the helicopter, because the aircraft too.
[00:46:00] Sure.
[00:46:01] Because the aircraft would be, oh yeah, we got you.
[00:46:02] We got you locked and we'll just, you guys can just pitch a ten.
[00:46:06] Pick the first one.
[00:46:07] Pick the first one.
[00:46:12] And the NVA, this still, you know, the big motto of the insurgents, right, is that they
[00:46:18] only fight when they want to and they don't have to fight if they don't need to.
[00:46:20] And you don't imagine troops that don't have to fight, just keep coming after you.
[00:46:29] Just keep, you're laying waste on, but they keep coming.
[00:46:34] That must to be the value of capturing you all cross border would be so high that they
[00:46:40] just must have had serious intent to try and capture.
[00:46:45] Well yeah, and then too, you know, you had that propaganda they've been fed for all those
[00:46:49] years.
[00:46:50] They really believed that like the French, we were there to occupy.
[00:46:55] So we're just there was combatting communism, but they never hurt any of that stuff.
[00:47:01] And they were dedicated.
[00:47:02] That's absolutely, yes, sir.
[00:47:06] Back to the book, the NVA had not given up.
[00:47:09] Its troops were hot on our tail, even though we had heard Tuan's claim or go off and
[00:47:14] had listened to the A1E's work them over.
[00:47:17] You had to hand it to the NVA soldiers.
[00:47:20] They were very tough and determined.
[00:47:22] I again contacted Kovie and asked for some tactical air command air support to our rear.
[00:47:31] And in a matter of minutes, bombs were falling and cannons were blasting away.
[00:47:35] I'm sure I was impressed with the service as the NVA were surprised by how quickly the
[00:47:40] ordinance had been delivered.
[00:47:42] They were learning less in the hard way.
[00:47:44] If a recon team wasn't wiped out in the first few minutes of the fight, the NVA would
[00:47:49] pay dearly for the mistake, but more than one NVA unit had experienced this firsthand.
[00:47:57] So that's kind of a critical few minutes as long as it's long to take for air to get
[00:48:02] on station usually.
[00:48:03] Well, it depends every time.
[00:48:05] Several hours to, in this case, we were fortunate to make contact really early on with
[00:48:11] Kovie, who fortunately had A1E's that were within a few minutes away.
[00:48:17] So there were some lock involved.
[00:48:19] Very much.
[00:48:20] I mean, we solved them, had that kind of response and lay us.
[00:48:23] Did you ever pre-plan to have coverage at certain times?
[00:48:27] It would be a special mission.
[00:48:28] Like the ones we put in the sensors, you put them in and you're going to be an account
[00:48:33] for two or three hours.
[00:48:35] He booked the times, had the asset set.
[00:48:38] So we have to go or something happens in between being you think come in.
[00:48:42] But most of the time, were these aircraft necessarily briefed on the mission?
[00:48:48] That's self.
[00:48:49] So do they know coming in?
[00:48:51] Hey, this is the a.o.
[00:48:52] That they're working.
[00:48:53] Oh, these guys just coming in.
[00:48:54] They were just random pilots.
[00:48:56] It would be both.
[00:48:58] They had specific A1 units in the Air Force in that timeframe that were specifically
[00:49:05] their for sog missions and SAR, search and rescue up north for any down pilots.
[00:49:11] So they were very much attuned to our people, working with contune and with us up north.
[00:49:18] So they knew everything was in the Prairie Fire A.
[00:49:23] Sometimes when we were in Echo 4, our first contact was with a fighter jet that heard the
[00:49:30] Erkten beeper and responded to that.
[00:49:34] So another mission is another aircraft would hear it.
[00:49:39] And if they had an ordinance, then we had to get the myriad, get them locate and find
[00:49:46] us and bring in the ordinance while he put the call out to get the cover or the Hillsboro
[00:49:51] or Moonbeam, to let the node head a tactical emergency going on here.
[00:49:58] And you're doing all that on the radio while you're still fighting.
[00:50:01] Yeah, we had to spend a few rounds there.
[00:50:07] Lighten the load.
[00:50:09] All right, Bubba, Sout and Falk had been busy placing explosive charges on trees while
[00:50:15] hepp and Tuan set out claim worse facing south.
[00:50:17] I couldn't help but shake my head in wonder at hepp in a dark jungle with night approaching.
[00:50:25] He still had his ever present sunglasses.
[00:50:28] We blew the charges around the trees and they were cut clean, but the dense jungle refused
[00:50:31] to let them fall.
[00:50:33] We had not succeeded in making the whole any bigger.
[00:50:35] So we just have to hope the rescue ships could manage to drop the ropes down to us and
[00:50:40] then pray the ropes were long enough.
[00:50:42] So you're trying to make that hole in the jungle a little bit bigger.
[00:50:46] Like what diameter is this hole that you're looking at?
[00:50:49] Oh, this is like 10 meters is it not that.
[00:50:52] You know, it's a good question.
[00:50:54] Maybe 20, 30 meters.
[00:50:55] Okay.
[00:50:56] At the most, but there's trees in it.
[00:50:58] Yeah.
[00:50:59] No, it's, this is a little bit more open as opposed to just triple canopy enclosed where
[00:51:04] you're just completely, we could see skylight.
[00:51:06] You could literally see the sky.
[00:51:08] But and then you try and blow some of the trees.
[00:51:10] They don't even fall down because there's too much jungle.
[00:51:12] Two lines.
[00:51:13] Yeah, two.
[00:51:14] Two trees.
[00:51:15] It doesn't even help.
[00:51:16] Good.
[00:51:17] Dimes.
[00:51:18] And to the frustration.
[00:51:22] We tried to blow up some palm trees or actually was leaf, leafs, puttune, tried to blow
[00:51:27] up some palm trees that were obstructing their view in a Overwatch position.
[00:51:32] Right.
[00:51:33] And they blew up.
[00:51:37] They said they sit so many charges on these palm trees.
[00:51:40] It was embarrassing.
[00:51:41] I got rung.
[00:51:42] I got rung.
[00:51:43] No, they weren't.
[00:51:44] They didn't budge.
[00:51:45] No, I got embarrassed.
[00:51:46] I'm sitting there telling the batiling commander.
[00:51:48] He's saying, well, I'm saying, Heather, sir, there's going to be another controlled
[00:51:51] debt and boom.
[00:51:52] And then something's going to be another controlled debt and then boom.
[00:51:54] And then something's going to be another controlled debt and then boom.
[00:51:57] He said, what are they doing?
[00:51:58] I said, it's a good word.
[00:51:59] It's a palm tree.
[00:52:00] He's don't worry about it.
[00:52:01] You know, what's there?
[00:52:02] We're just going to leave those palm trees.
[00:52:03] Yeah, the score right now is palm trees three seals.
[00:52:06] Yeah, that's what happened.
[00:52:08] Oh, no, those palm trees are hard.
[00:52:11] Resilient.
[00:52:12] Thick.
[00:52:13] All right.
[00:52:14] Back to the book.
[00:52:15] With the helicopters on their final approach, I threw out another smoke grenade
[00:52:18] to mark our location and the rest of the team began firing at the NVA who had again
[00:52:22] pressed in on us.
[00:52:23] We could barely make out their shadows, but they were definitely out there as evidence
[00:52:28] by the green trace around flying towards us.
[00:52:31] Covey hadn't been able to see my smoke.
[00:52:34] So he asked for a pen flare.
[00:52:36] And I tried to fire it up through the trees.
[00:52:38] It struck a limb and bounced back.
[00:52:40] Being desperate, I told Covey I was going to shoot three trace around, red trace around
[00:52:45] up through the hole.
[00:52:47] And before he could scream, no, I had pulled the trigger on my car 15.
[00:52:50] I immediately realized what a dangerous move it was as I saw him pass overhead.
[00:52:55] In case there was any doubt in my mind, Covey took the time to let me know in no unsuit
[00:53:00] in terms how stupid I was.
[00:53:02] I believe the expressions dumb asked and shit for brains came into play.
[00:53:06] Well, me.
[00:53:09] So you're in this situation.
[00:53:10] He still took the time to call you shit for brains.
[00:53:13] You're about to die.
[00:53:15] Pry, oh man.
[00:53:18] Yeah.
[00:53:19] And you know what's thinking?
[00:53:20] I never fought in Afghanistan.
[00:53:21] I don't know what they had.
[00:53:22] I don't know if they saw a lot of more green traceers over there.
[00:53:24] I'll have to ask some of them and buddies and never really thought about that.
[00:53:29] So that's a, was that just like the normal little pencil flare?
[00:53:32] Yes.
[00:53:33] A little trigger thing.
[00:53:34] You put crink.
[00:53:35] It's always like a 22 round that fires up its tracer.
[00:53:37] Yes.
[00:53:38] I didn't penetrate through.
[00:53:40] So you decide you're just going to fire the car.
[00:53:44] But all my tracers.
[00:53:45] But they saw him, right?
[00:53:46] They did.
[00:53:47] Yeah.
[00:53:48] So, hey, one for till.
[00:53:53] Just before the rescue choppers attempted to hover and drop the ropes, I told Covey I wanted
[00:53:56] the gunships that accompanied them to work over the area around us, particularly to the south.
[00:54:01] I wanted the NVA to be either dead wounded or with their heads buried in the ground, who
[00:54:05] we tried to make our escape.
[00:54:06] The muskets, the men from the 176 assault helicopter company immediately went to work
[00:54:12] with their 2.75 inch rockets and their gattling like mini guns, multi-barled weapons that
[00:54:19] could pump 6,000 rounds of 7,6 to a minute.
[00:54:23] As the last rocket hit and exploded behind us, the first 100 first airborne division
[00:54:28] slick appeared over the hole in the jungle roof and dropped sandbags with ropes attached
[00:54:32] to them.
[00:54:33] The helicopter was so high up that looked like a toy and even its powerful rotor wash
[00:54:38] couldn't reach us.
[00:54:39] I could tell he wasn't being buffeted by the wind, but he had somehow managed to hold
[00:54:43] steady over the opening.
[00:54:45] One of the sandbags attached to the rope had a strobe light attached to it and we watched
[00:54:49] it bounce off the limbs as it fell toward us.
[00:54:53] You guys I guess they had invented the jungle penetrator yet.
[00:54:59] They have but not on UEs.
[00:55:02] They had them on the HH3s and the job means giant.
[00:55:05] Yeah, for the other reason, they don't know it's like a big metal, yeah, jungle penetrator.
[00:55:10] It's a big metal kind of spear almost.
[00:55:13] And they've still able to talk to a crane and it just drops down and that weight and
[00:55:19] it's well shaped.
[00:55:20] As opposed to just a random sandbag bouncing in here.
[00:55:26] And so this thing was hot, this thing must have been like 150 feet up.
[00:55:30] Yeah, they had the longest ropes in there.
[00:55:33] Surprise even got down to us.
[00:55:39] Back to the book while we kept an eye on the ropes descending through the trees, the NVA mounted
[00:55:42] a desperate last charge towards us.
[00:55:44] We walked along and hept, triggered their claymores and the rest of us opened up with all we had.
[00:55:50] Somehow in the midst of all the tumultuous activity, the four in-ditch had managed to rig
[00:55:55] themselves a Swiss seat using the six foot long pieces of rope we carried just for that
[00:56:00] purpose.
[00:56:01] Bubba and I now tried to do the same but it wasn't easy to wrap a rope around my waist,
[00:56:05] pass it between my legs and then finish tying it off on the right hip while under fire.
[00:56:09] We managed to do it while the inditch held off the enemy and began to hook up for the left
[00:56:15] out.
[00:56:16] If you guys ever think about using some kind of pre-rigged like sit harness or something,
[00:56:23] they were developing those at the time.
[00:56:27] They upgraded the head like the McGuire rig, which is just basically a thick material
[00:56:32] that you could sit in and hook in and then later it came out with the rig.
[00:56:37] I can't think of name but it was an outfit where you had your harness built in.
[00:56:42] You had to web gear with the harness so when it came down you just hook in.
[00:56:47] Click in you ready?
[00:56:48] I'd be thinking about that in a single while.
[00:56:50] It's a lot.
[00:56:51] When I found this you tried to tie a Swiss seat.
[00:56:55] Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:57:00] We were getting low on ammunition, grenades and claymores.
[00:57:03] If we didn't make it out, it was going to be a very long night.
[00:57:06] In fact, I wasn't sure if we could survive the night no matter what kind of air support
[00:57:11] man is to reach us.
[00:57:13] It was now or never.
[00:57:15] Sound fork located three of the four ropes and it attached themselves to one of them using
[00:57:21] snap links.
[00:57:22] When I asked a cubby if the chopper could lift us all out of once, he replied, no way, it's
[00:57:26] going to take two lifts.
[00:57:28] No way is exactly what I thought in return.
[00:57:31] There was no way we had enough time for two attempts.
[00:57:33] There was no way I was going to split the team.
[00:57:36] Either all six of us were going out together on four ropes.
[00:57:39] Oh, we were going to die together trying.
[00:57:42] Call it camaraderie or fear, but I was not going to leave anyone.
[00:57:46] Myself included on the ground for a minute longer than necessary.
[00:57:50] I'd heard all the horror stories I needed to about what could result in and I didn't want
[00:57:55] to be the subject of some gruesome tale around the bar at F.O.B.1.
[00:58:00] I suddenly had a bright idea and asked Bubba if he still had the claim or with the white
[00:58:05] phosphorus grenade taped to its front.
[00:58:07] When he nodded, yes, I told him to strap it as high as he could as high as he could reach
[00:58:12] on a nearby tree facing south.
[00:58:14] He gave me his best, are you out of your fucking mind?
[00:58:17] Look, because he knew at that proximity, the back blast would kill us all when we set it off.
[00:58:25] So he hesitated and I had to order him to do it.
[00:58:28] As he finished the remaining two little people paired up and hooked themselves onto into
[00:58:32] one of the ropes while Bubba and I each took one of the remaining two.
[00:58:36] I wanted to balance out the weight distribution by having me on one side of the helicopter
[00:58:40] and Bubba on the other, but it was impossible to tell for sure which ropes went where.
[00:58:45] So I took a wild guess and hoped for the best.
[00:58:48] Best.
[00:58:49] Using the barrel of my M79 to shield the flash from the NVA, I used a strobe like to signal
[00:58:54] the chopper to begin lifting us out.
[00:58:58] Did the chopper have enough power?
[00:59:01] Would we be dragged through the trees?
[00:59:03] Would the NVA manage to shoot one or all of us out of our saddles?
[00:59:08] We were about to find out.
[00:59:11] As the ropes became taught, fire, gunfire erupted from the west, south, fucking, I returned,
[00:59:17] fire, but our bodies blocked the others line of sight so they watched in frustration.
[00:59:23] Because my rope was longer than the other three, I was the last to leave the ground.
[00:59:27] This also gave me the additional seconds I needed to reload my empty car 15 twice.
[00:59:33] Things were happening very fast almost too fast and my bright idea demanded perfect timing
[00:59:38] as we started up, Bubba reached out and ignited the delay flues on the delay fuse on the
[00:59:44] last claim or the one he'd fastened to the tree.
[00:59:48] With my feet dangling in the air, I fired around for my M79.
[00:59:53] Still gaining altitude, I then pulled the pins on two hand grenades and tossed them down
[00:59:58] onto the ground at about the same time that claim more went off.
[01:00:03] The back blast blew under us, but we could still feel it's power and heat.
[01:00:09] The phosphorus was like a giant flash bulb going off, and that frozen instant of illumination
[01:00:15] I could finally see the faces of my enemy.
[01:00:18] They were hurting.
[01:00:20] But still advancing.
[01:00:23] The engine screaming, the Huey somehow came up with the power it needed.
[01:00:28] It was agonizingly slow going and we had to push our way through some branches, but we
[01:00:33] were not being dragged through them.
[01:00:35] We were being lifted straight up.
[01:00:37] The NVA continued to fire at us and I had the unsettling impression that trace around
[01:00:43] for passing between my legs and sensation that will give any man pause for thought.
[01:00:50] The team fired back on full automatic and we threw the last of our grenades.
[01:00:55] Like two fiercely-demented and determined beasts, the NVA and RT Idaho remain locked in battle
[01:01:02] to the bitter end.
[01:01:05] As we finally cleared the trees, I immediately called Kovie and confessed our little
[01:01:09] deception.
[01:01:10] The team is out.
[01:01:12] The whole team is out, I screamed into the handset.
[01:01:14] We came out together, do not send in a second helicopter.
[01:01:18] I repeat, no second chopper.
[01:01:21] The muskets rolled in and pulverize the ground.
[01:01:24] We had just left.
[01:01:25] The A1Es were right behind them and as the muffled explosion and light flashes reached
[01:01:31] me, I found myself feeling a little sorry for the NVA troops down there.
[01:01:36] They were valiant and dedicated soldiers.
[01:01:39] They would have to be a credit to any army.
[01:01:43] Those left alive would no doubt have some stories to tell.
[01:01:47] And I doubted that they would ever admit that a six-man team had held them at bay for so
[01:01:52] long and then escaped their most determined efforts to wipe them out.
[01:01:58] As for RT Idaho, we were simply happy to be alive.
[01:02:04] Not something I would have bet on a short while earlier.
[01:02:09] Oh yeah.
[01:02:17] We were lucky too because of the...
[01:02:19] It was more or more lucky than that.
[01:02:23] We used to hold a lot of luck on that one.
[01:02:26] But we were still relatively high and not like the big peaks and deeper into layoffs.
[01:02:34] So the helicopter was able to pull us out.
[01:02:37] If that had been in the middle of the day and with jungle heat and heat of the day, he never
[01:02:44] would have been able to live six of us out.
[01:02:47] But we weighed all that and I did not listen to the cub.
[01:02:50] We just rolled the dice because it was so dark at that point.
[01:02:55] So oh yeah, the recon guide's smoth on us one more time.
[01:03:00] So when you...
[01:03:01] Once you got pulled out, would they just look for a clearing somewhere to set down, get
[01:03:05] you guys in the helicopter for real?
[01:03:07] No that's the part that they just froze your balls all the way home.
[01:03:12] Because with the Swiss season out, it was just everything goes numb.
[01:03:16] And so because it was dark, particularly they wanted to make sure they were ready to
[01:03:21] put us down.
[01:03:22] It was going to be somewhere in South Vietnam.
[01:03:23] So we were in the air.
[01:03:24] I just figured how long and they finally set us down.
[01:03:27] But you can't walk.
[01:03:28] You lie to like a triple for a few minutes.
[01:03:31] Yeah.
[01:03:32] On clip, you can't flip.
[01:03:33] So they didn't really care about your comfort.
[01:03:37] No.
[01:03:38] And we didn't clean too much.
[01:03:40] But you go, you're all sweaty.
[01:03:42] And you held it.
[01:03:43] Five minutes later, you're a 5000 feet, which is cold.
[01:03:46] People get how cold it is at 5000 feet.
[01:03:49] Yeah, you're freezing.
[01:03:50] Yeah, especially because you're soaking wet.
[01:03:52] And you're going 80 miles an hour.
[01:03:55] So you go 80 mile an hour a wind.
[01:03:57] All that too.
[01:04:01] And this is just, I mean, this is crazy.
[01:04:06] It's absolutely crazy.
[01:04:09] And this was just over and over again.
[01:04:12] Now, you know, I spent a lot of time on the books on the last couple podcasts.
[01:04:20] I wanted to kind of just ask you a couple questions.
[01:04:25] Get your thoughts on some stuff.
[01:04:28] And I also, and I don't know, we might have to come back again.
[01:04:30] And I got sawed chronicles here.
[01:04:32] I read that outstanding book.
[01:04:34] And this is sawed chronicles real quick.
[01:04:38] Talks about a big operation that took place, that you weren't on.
[01:04:43] But you got really good descriptions and talked to people.
[01:04:46] Operation tailwind.
[01:04:48] That's another one where helicopters are getting shot down.
[01:04:51] I mean, it's completely insane.
[01:04:55] Yeah, and no ordinary.
[01:04:57] He looked these are the CH53s.
[01:04:59] They're not the models.
[01:05:00] Yeah.
[01:05:01] The biggest Marine Corps had.
[01:05:03] And they took out two of those.
[01:05:04] I think left one really banged up.
[01:05:07] And when they inserted, they still, they had three WAs on their assertion.
[01:05:12] But they had to get in for that to take the pressure off of the CIA operation.
[01:05:17] That was the mission, September 1970.
[01:05:19] Yeah.
[01:05:20] So that's Operation tailwind.
[01:05:22] Operation tailwind.
[01:05:23] And that book saw chronicles volume one.
[01:05:26] And I hope there's going to be about 30 more volumes of sawed.
[01:05:30] We're going to be working on the model that Anne and I came up with is that we're going
[01:05:33] to write till we die.
[01:05:35] I like it.
[01:05:36] Because there's so many saws stories that there have been told could we couldn't tell.
[01:05:39] And so many of our guys.
[01:05:40] I mean, even when I, a fellow recon guy, talked to him.
[01:05:44] It's like pulling information on him.
[01:05:46] I'm sure you've run into that with your people.
[01:05:48] They're not, they're not inclined to talk.
[01:05:51] Well, yeah.
[01:05:52] They're modest.
[01:05:53] That's an interesting thing because people do not want to be at the bar.
[01:05:56] Yeah.
[01:05:57] I'm a green beret or a machine.
[01:05:58] And most of the guys, when people say, well, you should have more guys from to you
[01:06:03] bruiser on there.
[01:06:04] You have to have more guys more seals on.
[01:06:06] The seals that I know that I would want to have on a lot of them.
[01:06:08] They're still in.
[01:06:09] Or they don't want to come on.
[01:06:10] That's it.
[01:06:11] They won't say it.
[01:06:12] Yeah.
[01:06:13] They're like, hey, I'm good.
[01:06:15] And then obviously, I got a lot of my friends that do come on.
[01:06:19] And it's great when they come on.
[01:06:21] But yeah, a lot of guys are still doing it.
[01:06:25] And so, hey, that's the way it is.
[01:06:27] Once those guys retire, and I do have some friends that are retired soon, and they're
[01:06:30] become what I'm on.
[01:06:31] So that's pretty awesome.
[01:06:32] Oh, yeah.
[01:06:33] But yeah.
[01:06:34] So the song Chronicles, you've, like I said, hopefully there's 30 volumes that right
[01:06:39] now there's just one.
[01:06:40] We're going to try to turn across the fence and on a ground into audio books.
[01:06:45] That's awesome.
[01:06:46] That's our project right now.
[01:06:47] And then as soon as we're done with that, it commenced with volume two.
[01:06:53] And we got a couple of stories there.
[01:06:55] What a one that we talked about in on the ground, the August 23 attack.
[01:07:01] We've had a lot more research.
[01:07:03] We had the scale who's a, as she was in M.I. and she has pulled out more information.
[01:07:08] She's going to pull the whole thing together for the, hopefully the most detailed story
[01:07:12] in the night because we're such a tragic, yet heroic night for the people that were there
[01:07:17] on the ground in night.
[01:07:18] And Larry Trimble up on Marble Mountain.
[01:07:20] Yeah.
[01:07:21] And that couple of the stories, many other stories.
[01:07:24] But there's the other one.
[01:07:27] One of our guys went in for a bright light and they got shot out at a, at four
[01:07:33] crass.
[01:07:35] As it was crashing, you hit three separate hill tops coming to rest on a third one.
[01:07:40] They got to the second hill and got shot out.
[01:07:45] He went back 25 years later.
[01:07:47] He became a doctor on his own money spent $70,000 to go back to Cambodia to try to find
[01:07:55] that effort just nodded his conscience.
[01:07:58] They got in, got to the site and we're run off by bandits.
[01:08:03] He went back now, would be two years ago, with DPA.
[01:08:07] And DPA was working on the second hill where the jet was on the third hill.
[01:08:13] So he's able to go in to give them direct sighting as to where the dig.
[01:08:18] So there's still work and he was on the ground digging things out with these guys.
[01:08:22] That's going to be a netbook.
[01:08:23] Yeah.
[01:08:24] So check out that book too.
[01:08:28] Saw Chronicles.
[01:08:30] You're training.
[01:08:33] How ready do you think you were when you got to Vietnam?
[01:08:36] How ready for you for what you were about to encounter?
[01:08:41] Well, a lot better than the guys that went through just basic training and advanced infantry
[01:08:45] training.
[01:08:46] And I'm sure that commencement units had in country training.
[01:08:50] Our in country training was good.
[01:08:53] He worked.
[01:08:54] We practiced calling in spooky, worked with the helicopters, told about the dangers and working
[01:09:00] with the little people, the history as well as some of the do's and don'ts about working
[01:09:06] with South Vietnamese.
[01:09:09] I thought that was good, but then to just no aid camp duty, I think all that was geared
[01:09:15] for the aid camps.
[01:09:17] Sog was just at another level.
[01:09:19] And that's why we always talked.
[01:09:20] So people like Pat Watkins by the parks, John McGovern, Dick Gross, they were the senior
[01:09:26] e7s or e6s in camp.
[01:09:28] All of whom had run at night.
[01:09:31] A screen guys would talk to them, particularly after mission.
[01:09:35] And then we talked to each other.
[01:09:36] You know, John Watten came back from a target and where Tom Cunney-Hemp's leg was blown
[01:09:43] off.
[01:09:44] One of those little people who got shot four times and captain 10 who saved us and knocked
[01:09:48] over, pulled them out and August.
[01:09:51] And we talked right away.
[01:09:52] That night, well, what did you learn?
[01:09:55] And it always be just back and forth to try to get any sense of what happened to anything
[01:10:01] you could do to give us anything for another edge in the field.
[01:10:05] And meanwhile, we're getting the intel reports.
[01:10:07] We knew about all the teams that had been wiped out.
[01:10:09] And the intel reports about the sappers.
[01:10:12] So you all bounced it out and just keep things with us.
[01:10:15] So an answer to your question.
[01:10:17] Sog was so different, a lot of with innovative.
[01:10:20] The things we were doing there were the strings.
[01:10:23] That was all things that used today really advanced.
[01:10:26] You know, no fast ropes.
[01:10:28] That was another dimension of when, another war.
[01:10:31] So we're working that firepower, working with the air assets and new weapons.
[01:10:39] But it was all like to experiment with things.
[01:10:41] The learns you go, try to take was best.
[01:10:42] And like, limb black blow yourself up in the, and the ambushes were good luck to make
[01:10:46] sure it really works.
[01:10:49] Did you, when you were calling for fires?
[01:10:51] So I don't know if you know this, but now it's like a school you go to.
[01:10:55] You go to a joint tattoo leader controller school and that's sort of your specialty is calling
[01:10:59] for fire call or bombs.
[01:11:02] But you just, you trained in country to learn how to do it.
[01:11:08] Yes.
[01:11:09] And again, we talked to, that's what we talked to spider and pat walk as specifically.
[01:11:14] And so that was, that was more important than actually going out pop in the smoke and
[01:11:19] having the gun run.
[01:11:20] It was learning how to do it the right way.
[01:11:23] Now you're in a box and you never have a gun run go across you.
[01:11:27] It'd be in front, you know, you're front to left southeast and you direct it that way.
[01:11:32] And how many inches, I mean, how many feet of yards from your perimeter, how many meters.
[01:11:37] And that applied when we got to the field because once we were up at Fubai, we didn't
[01:11:44] practice air strikes.
[01:11:45] Once we were on the ground, we did it.
[01:11:48] But it did it with confidence.
[01:11:50] Thanks to spider or walkins and John McGovern particularly.
[01:11:54] They sat with us, our green guys at night and made us understand that.
[01:11:59] And we had a couple cases where people made mistakes and teams got hit and lost people.
[01:12:04] They had their brain and some people.
[01:12:07] We were our body count was so low that they were bringing in people from other units.
[01:12:11] And they would come in cocky.
[01:12:14] And once they got on the ground, they were just maybe a little too cocky and had to listen
[01:12:17] to all lessons.
[01:12:19] And some of the teams will let the other people carry their rest.
[01:12:22] Why carry their radio.
[01:12:23] And we had one team, young guy came in and called the air strike on its own team.
[01:12:29] They came with a gun and we're right across the teams.
[01:12:32] R.O.N. and it's like that.
[01:12:35] So that does not surprise me at all.
[01:12:38] I mean, when I'm listening to a reading your books, the fact that you guys were doing that,
[01:12:45] you obviously had a massive amount of skill to not have that happen.
[01:12:50] Because like I said, these guys are looking at a jungle canopy.
[01:12:53] They look at some random bit of smoke that came out and yet you're directing fire based
[01:12:58] on that.
[01:12:59] It's awesome.
[01:13:00] But I could see where somebody could easily make a mistake.
[01:13:05] You give the wrong direction.
[01:13:07] Look at your compass is spinning the wrong way.
[01:13:09] It's good close to your weapon.
[01:13:10] You've got your carmel directions.
[01:13:12] I mean, there's so many things that could go wrong.
[01:13:14] And yet you're just doing.
[01:13:16] I mean, there's times we're out there doing gun runs for 12 hours straight.
[01:13:21] And like your case, where you had the unit that you wanted to attack the building and
[01:13:29] you challenged the three times and the last time you called it up because it was another
[01:13:33] unit, another seal team.
[01:13:35] Well, we had that common sense thing on the ground, too, where we would direct it.
[01:13:39] But if there was something that wasn't quite right, you put everything on hold until
[01:13:43] you got it right.
[01:13:45] Yeah, that's weird.
[01:13:46] Because late for my road extreme ownership and we didn't really coordinate stories that
[01:13:53] we were talking about.
[01:13:54] And yet there's multiple stories in there about either blue on blues or a potential blue
[01:13:59] on blues because man in a city like that with all these different units running around
[01:14:04] all on different radio frequencies and a bunch of enemy, Mujah, Dean fighters running
[01:14:09] around in there, too.
[01:14:10] It was blue on blue was a very real thing.
[01:14:13] And there would be probably one case of blue on blue a day that would happen and maybe
[01:14:20] one a week that would get reported.
[01:14:22] You know, but just, and I'm not talking where someone is shot, but like, you know, just
[01:14:27] all of a sudden you're taking rounds and you're like, where are those coming from?
[01:14:29] Oh, that's another unit down there.
[01:14:32] And maybe before, and for a one opening up moment, exactly exactly.
[01:14:36] So that it would happen all the time.
[01:14:39] And that's one thing that was nice about, well, for you, if not nice, but it's
[01:14:43] less complicated, you're the only friendly guys out there to watch out.
[01:14:46] Oh, there was no friendly fire happening.
[01:14:48] You guys, you're a versus them.
[01:14:50] Yeah, all of them.
[01:14:51] Yeah.
[01:14:51] When you got mission taskings, where did they come from?
[01:14:59] Where did they come from up above?
[01:15:00] Where you guys developing targets yourself?
[01:15:03] Where did that process?
[01:15:04] That's what happened, mix of both.
[01:15:07] The Channing Command for Saw, went to Sawcheadquarters right to the White House.
[01:15:11] They had somebody from DOD that was there.
[01:15:14] I don't know, some general, somebody.
[01:15:16] But that was their mission was keeping on on Sawc.
[01:15:19] So they was sent missions from there that would come to Headquarters to each F.O.B.
[01:15:25] And then our immediate action reports that I'll go back after action reports to go back
[01:15:31] through the Channing Command.
[01:15:33] So they knew what was going on at the White House.
[01:15:35] There was somebody at the White House.
[01:15:36] That's where we were told.
[01:15:38] And on occasions, if we had a target that we wanted to do B.52 strike, that would go back
[01:15:44] through the Channing Command and then get approval on it.
[01:15:47] But from what the public knew, the public knew we were bombing.
[01:15:53] Not even know anything about that.
[01:15:54] They didn't even know we were bombing Louson Combo to get.
[01:15:59] Nothing.
[01:16:00] There was no reporters in there.
[01:16:01] There's no communist news network back then.
[01:16:05] So the communist would not talk about it because they agreed to the agreement.
[01:16:12] Not having their people there.
[01:16:13] Cadillac said, hey, Louson Combo, they're neutral.
[01:16:16] We respect them.
[01:16:17] Line dogs.
[01:16:19] And we said the same thing.
[01:16:20] But ours, we just went in with our recon teams.
[01:16:23] I suppose that them just going down and slaving all the people to work there.
[01:16:28] Work with us, help us open the roads.
[01:16:30] And if we saw in Disney's people, we would not open fire on.
[01:16:33] I mean, it's like not going to go at local people.
[01:16:35] They don't know any better, just caught in the middle.
[01:16:39] But the NVA, they were talking.
[01:16:43] You work with us so you die.
[01:16:45] Well, you know, in one of the books you're talking about how the NVA treated the
[01:16:50] in-dedge people there, so horribly that the in-dedge troops that you worked with, but
[01:16:55] hated the NVA.
[01:16:56] Oh, they hated them.
[01:16:57] That these NVA had raped their women, beat their wives and just unharable things.
[01:17:02] Absolutely.
[01:17:03] They were there for, they were there to fight.
[01:17:06] Yep.
[01:17:07] And they cut nobody else like them.
[01:17:10] I mean, America today, particularly our snowflakes, don't know what the soldiers of
[01:17:17] Communists were really like in the field.
[01:17:20] And it's just nasty people.
[01:17:22] And that's what we were fighting.
[01:17:25] And they were really dedicated.
[01:17:27] And they're just, that's a purpose because they've been so thoroughly indoctrinated.
[01:17:32] And they really believe what they were doing, even though they were working off a propaganda.
[01:17:40] Yeah.
[01:17:41] When you, so you would come up with some of the missions, some of the missions would come
[01:17:44] down to you.
[01:17:45] Majority came.
[01:17:46] Majority came down to you.
[01:17:47] And of course, you know, they would have, sometimes I think there would be, we
[01:17:52] got a team on a ground.
[01:17:53] That's why we were going in primary secondary all think it's shot out, eat lunch, go
[01:17:58] back and try again.
[01:17:59] And they just wanted to get somebody on the ground.
[01:18:02] And that would just be your, that's an automatic area of reconnaissance.
[01:18:06] And that's because they had something they wanted to see there, something like that.
[01:18:09] Sometimes her S3 people would just want to get a team on the ground so they could
[01:18:12] report a headquarters at night.
[01:18:14] We had one or two teams on the ground.
[01:18:17] Wait, do you mean that they're just wanting to, hey, look what we're doing?
[01:18:21] Yeah.
[01:18:22] Now, I'll show you guys that on S3 would deny that in fanitly.
[01:18:26] But it felt like that.
[01:18:28] Yeah.
[01:18:29] I came back and said, here's the new target.
[01:18:31] And they'll pick an LZ for you while you're flying back to the next target.
[01:18:36] Did you ever, what if you, what if there was a mission that you looked at and you said, hey,
[01:18:40] this is dumb.
[01:18:42] This doesn't make sense.
[01:18:43] What is only one that I declined to remember about Christmas time of 68.
[01:18:47] I just had a feeling.
[01:18:48] And a team went in.
[01:18:49] I was worried.
[01:18:50] But they were on the ground for five days and it was a dry hole.
[01:18:53] And they came out without any shots fired or anything.
[01:18:56] So that's the one time I officially turned something down.
[01:18:59] Maybe that's why you had a bad feeling.
[01:19:00] Tell it, you knew nothing was going to happen.
[01:19:02] It wasn't your kind of target.
[01:19:04] Yeah.
[01:19:05] I don't want a boring target.
[01:19:08] So how did it go when you said no?
[01:19:11] Would you say, hey, look, my guys need rest.
[01:19:12] Sorry.
[01:19:13] Yeah, not this time.
[01:19:14] We had to write to say no.
[01:19:16] It was frowned on.
[01:19:17] But at that time, we had a couple of new teams in camp.
[01:19:22] And Rodney had came in and he was a good one zero.
[01:19:25] So he went out and he came back to, hey, that target was pretty cool.
[01:19:28] We stopped a lot.
[01:19:30] Dry hole.
[01:19:31] Dry hole.
[01:19:32] I said, really?
[01:19:33] So how are these feelings, man?
[01:19:34] I was hyperventilating to that figure.
[01:19:35] We were going to run into Ho Chi Minh and a couple of divisions again for good luck.
[01:19:40] I hadn't seen a division in a month.
[01:19:42] No, it's like, okay.
[01:19:45] But no.
[01:19:46] So that kind of showed me how your mental state of mind too.
[01:19:50] Because that's why I believed.
[01:19:53] And the system was such that you could turn it down.
[01:19:56] And we took it from there.
[01:19:58] When you say that's where you believed, you believed that it was a bad target.
[01:20:02] I just thought we had been so lucky and going through the Christmas Thanksgiving and everything
[01:20:07] else that our, I just thought our number was going to be, we didn't know how.
[01:20:12] And I just said, this could be the target.
[01:20:14] It's an M.A.
[01:20:14] Target.
[01:20:15] And those are particularly, the ones are on long to DMZ River west of Vietnam that went deeper
[01:20:22] into chaos.
[01:20:24] And there were nasty, we lost several teams up there.
[01:20:27] I figured this could be our turn.
[01:20:29] So, buzz wrong?
[01:20:31] No, did you ever get that feeling again?
[01:20:35] Not, not not strong enough to act on it.
[01:20:38] I mean, the carried it back in my tiny mind.
[01:20:40] It was like, that's the best time you thought you were going to die.
[01:20:44] You didn't.
[01:20:45] I had some guys that thought they were going to die every time we left the wire.
[01:20:49] You know what I mean?
[01:20:54] God bless them, but he's no man, this could die could be the night man.
[01:20:56] No, I'm not feeling good about this one.
[01:20:57] And they'd always get their gear on, but I'd say, I mean, I always looked at as a good sign.
[01:20:59] If certain people were scared, if they wouldn't have been scared, I would have been nervous
[01:21:04] because they were so scared all the time.
[01:21:05] I think, man, this must be really stressful for them.
[01:21:10] I never wrote the letter.
[01:21:11] We're like, dear mom and dad, I'm dead now.
[01:21:13] If you read this letter, I'm dead.
[01:21:15] Yeah.
[01:21:16] I felt, and hope that we somehow get through it.
[01:21:21] And you're right about the scare thing.
[01:21:23] You want that emotional edge, a little fear can go along.
[01:21:26] It's a great motivator.
[01:21:28] But I wouldn't go out with a guy if somebody was saying, hey, man, I'm not afraid.
[01:21:34] I'm afraid of you, do you go somebody else?
[01:21:36] I also used to get the feeling that if you were scared like that, if you were scared,
[01:21:44] and you were going to be hesitant, that was going to be bad.
[01:21:48] Sure.
[01:21:49] Like, I was more worried about guys that were hesitant or I felt like if they were hesitant
[01:21:57] on the battlefield, that would work out bad for them.
[01:22:03] The guys that I always felt like, okay, if someone's aggressive, not not unaffraid
[01:22:08] and suicidal like that, but just, hey, oh yeah, I'm going to go, I'm going to go,
[01:22:13] I'm going to go out with a guy right now.
[01:22:14] I always felt that was the attitude to have.
[01:22:16] It was to be aggressive.
[01:22:17] It was to be like, okay, yeah, well, oh, you want an opt for us?
[01:22:21] Cool, we'll go do it.
[01:22:22] Now we turned down opts too.
[01:22:24] There was opts where we looked at and said, man, this is not good.
[01:22:28] And this is a massive amount of risk.
[01:22:30] I mean, there was areas where there was areas where they were taken,
[01:22:36] IED strikes on vehicles, and like, you know,
[01:22:40] when in a big IED hits a Humvee, everyone dies or three out of five people die or something like that,
[01:22:45] I mean, it's very catastrophic.
[01:22:47] And it was one target they were looking at for us.
[01:22:50] They asked us to do.
[01:22:52] And there was like one road going in and that had multiple big IED strikes.
[01:22:57] And then they wanted us to, they were asking if we could take out more,
[01:23:03] it was either a mortar team or an IED in place or but we were looking at it and where
[01:23:07] the mortar has been launched from, we're all over the place.
[01:23:09] So it was just, it was one of the, one of the types of missions where we looked at it and said,
[01:23:14] hey, there's got to be a better way to do this because us going up there is not going to be worse than it.
[01:23:18] A lot of your missions were point missions, right?
[01:23:20] What do you mean by that?
[01:23:21] They gave you a target, get to this point and wipe it out.
[01:23:25] I would say my first deployment, it was go capture kill back guys.
[01:23:31] That was my first deployment to Iraq, we were in Baghdad,
[01:23:33] that's mostly what we were doing.
[01:23:34] Middle the night, we'd find out where a bad guy was, we'd go get him.
[01:23:38] And that's what my second deployment in Ramadi, mostly what guys were doing was
[01:23:44] Overwatch, sniper Overwatch positions set up and building.
[01:23:47] So that when the bad guys would either maneuver on friendly forces or they'd be out doing what they
[01:23:52] shouldn't be doing, right?
[01:23:53] The guys would take them out.
[01:23:54] So that's pretty much the, then there's all kinds of crap in between that everything from,
[01:24:00] you know, everything from doing just reconnaissance of areas.
[01:24:03] To counter mortar types, it's just, you know, a lot of other things would happen.
[01:24:10] But primarily it was direct action missions going out, take out a target or these sniper
[01:24:15] Overwatch types, but you know, we'd be doing big clearances to big conventional clearances.
[01:24:20] You know, we had our, we called them jundies, which is,
[01:24:23] the jundie means, it means soldier in, in Arabic.
[01:24:26] Right.
[01:24:27] And so we call them jundies, that's what they call themselves jundies.
[01:24:30] So we had jundies, like you guys had little people, like you had in-ditch force.
[01:24:34] We had in-ditch forces, they were jundies.
[01:24:36] And so we would do very conventional missions with the jundies of them.
[01:24:41] And us, you know, we'd be overseeing them as they cleared big sections of the city.
[01:24:44] And we'd be working in conjunction with the army.
[01:24:47] So yeah, we did a little bit of everything.
[01:24:50] But, um, we see that brings us back to our side of it,
[01:24:54] where you can give yourself a mental delusion,
[01:24:57] which is our mission is to go look in an area recon.
[01:25:02] So theoretically, you're going to get inserted quietly and go back to your job.
[01:25:06] And that's different from you with your point of mission.
[01:25:09] So hold different frame of mind.
[01:25:11] So, theoretically, okay, we're hoping to get in to our mission to come back and report,
[01:25:15] or find a fuel line, blow it up, or get the POW,
[01:25:20] get the wire taps, give them a mental, where you're going out and doing your IED pick-up,
[01:25:26] and mortars, that's totally different.
[01:25:29] So at least in my mind, I think that's part of my self-confered factor.
[01:25:34] We're going to get inserted and cover nice quiet mission for five or six days.
[01:25:38] Takes some pictures.
[01:25:40] That sounds great.
[01:25:41] And come on back, it's really cool.
[01:25:43] Yeah.
[01:25:43] We're behind any mean line.
[01:25:44] What percentage of operations would you guys get contacted on?
[01:25:48] We left, always left under fire.
[01:25:50] The only question was how much?
[01:25:52] Never had, well, one.
[01:25:55] They won, where we got, you opened up our discussion tonight, where we got pulled out.
[01:26:01] There's no fire there because they came in and got us.
[01:26:03] We had a great RON, and we were going to get some POWs, but they pulled us out right away.
[01:26:09] So it's no gunfire in that mission, but other than that, every time we left under gunfire,
[01:26:13] it's only a question of how much.
[01:26:15] Some titles like the whole John Lowe light enough.
[01:26:18] Sometimes it'll only be two or three hundred.
[01:26:20] And yet you still fooled yourself with the thinking,
[01:26:22] hey, this recon is going to be different.
[01:26:26] But yeah, so I guess my point was I looked at it, and I still look at it.
[01:26:32] If you are nervous about getting hurt, if you're nervous about something going wrong,
[01:26:37] to me, that's when something goes wrong.
[01:26:39] Yeah.
[01:26:40] When you're nervous about it, now I'm not saying you should be arrogant about it and think,
[01:26:43] oh, we're going to get away with whatever.
[01:26:45] But I'm saying, like when you're doing a sport, you know,
[01:26:50] when you're doing some physical activity, if you're afraid, you might get injured.
[01:26:54] To me, that's when you get injured.
[01:26:56] It's when you're, when you're afraid, I think fear can hurt you.
[01:27:01] And that being said, the other side of the coin is, if you have no fear,
[01:27:05] well, you're definitely at risk.
[01:27:07] He who has a taste is lost.
[01:27:09] There you go.
[01:27:10] So there's a dichotomy there.
[01:27:11] That's not a good balance.
[01:27:12] Yeah, and that's where we're so lucky.
[01:27:14] You know, heept a sale that a great job of vetting our indigenous troops,
[01:27:18] and to go from spider parks to walk in to Baba,
[01:27:22] and then back to Limbac, and then when I left the team,
[01:27:26] it was in Lens Hands.
[01:27:28] And then I came back, Lens the ones, you know,
[01:27:31] what more could you ask for?
[01:27:33] So that was just a very fortunate.
[01:27:36] What was your mission planning like?
[01:27:39] So you guys get a tasking?
[01:27:41] How long did you guys plan for?
[01:27:44] For just an area mission, area reconcest, very little.
[01:27:48] With the wire tabs, obviously we did hours and hours of training on that.
[01:27:52] And then as time went on, you know, first it was just sale,
[01:27:56] who could do it, and then sale trained,
[01:27:58] have and fuck the guys are as strong to do it all.
[01:28:02] And as well, every aspect of it,
[01:28:05] and then we cross trained each other.
[01:28:07] And we even had so that,
[01:28:09] we had to begin to teach a couple of young guys basic English.
[01:28:14] So if any of us got killed,
[01:28:16] had to take over to radio, or the end did to take over.
[01:28:20] So a couple of guys that like,
[01:28:22] chow and hung, as it went,
[01:28:24] hung came on the team.
[01:28:25] They picked up being was pretty quick.
[01:28:27] So we worked with them.
[01:28:28] And we practiced calling in, working on the radio,
[01:28:31] the problems with the batteries, and things like that.
[01:28:33] So we crossed trained everything back and forth.
[01:28:36] And the wire tab was one of the particular ones where we had several guys in the team
[01:28:40] trained up to do it all.
[01:28:41] Everything from known about the batteries, watching it,
[01:28:44] keeping the battery indicator to get to put the wire up the tree
[01:28:49] or a telephone pole.
[01:28:51] And when you came down to your cover,
[01:28:52] that was from that area.
[01:28:55] So it looked like it was part of that area, trying to cover the wire.
[01:28:58] But as far as the actual mission planning of,
[01:29:01] okay, here's where we're going in tonight.
[01:29:04] They didn't take you much because you were running repetitive type missions.
[01:29:09] It's a high degree of similarity.
[01:29:11] The most important thing was the training.
[01:29:13] So when you may contact, you could take care of yourself and
[01:29:17] how to react, try to continue the mission.
[01:29:20] But these were like reconnaissance.
[01:29:22] So once you've been seen or compromised, the mission's compromised.
[01:29:27] Would you be flying in?
[01:29:31] What was your degree of certainty on where you were inserted?
[01:29:35] Oh, we knew very clear where we were gone.
[01:29:38] So like in the case, we talked to Kavi.
[01:29:41] We sent the three LZs down to Saigon.
[01:29:44] And Kavi would go pick a site.
[01:29:46] And then he would tell me on the radio, okay, this is where we're gone.
[01:29:50] And would you be looking at your map as you started?
[01:29:53] And he knew what the frame was.
[01:29:55] So it would be in that map.
[01:29:57] Yeah.
[01:29:58] That we would have sexed them out that we could.
[01:30:01] I remember when we first, you know, as a radioman, believe it or not,
[01:30:05] when GPS's first came out, the radioman kind of got saddled with the GPS
[01:30:10] because it was a piece of electronic equipment.
[01:30:12] No one else could work with electronic equipment.
[01:30:15] So I would be usually a lot of times be carrying the GPS as opposed to the
[01:30:19] point meant.
[01:30:20] And the point man, you know, was still using mapping compasses that early
[01:30:23] in the early 90s. But the GPS wouldn't always work well in a helicopter.
[01:30:28] And so sometimes they took me, you know, this is some training operations where I learned
[01:30:34] oh, so I'm not what I think I am.
[01:30:36] And you get out and that GPS finally finds itself and you realize your three
[01:30:40] clicks away from where you're supposed to be or whatever and it's bad.
[01:30:43] And that's why we'd go, I went back to, hey, when I'm in the helicopter, I'm on a map.
[01:30:47] So that way when my boss looks at me and says, hey, we're we're we're we're
[01:30:50] supposed to be either yes or no, like don't get out of the bird or okay, we're good.
[01:30:55] But but that. So I was thinking about that for you guys. You'd be doing the same thing
[01:31:00] as you approach to okay, yep, there's that train feature. There's this other train
[01:31:03] feature, cool where we're we're we're supposed to be.
[01:31:06] Yeah, and then last also we wanted to know what a water was because some of the
[01:31:10] targets they had more more streams of things. So we carry less water. I will
[01:31:14] literally just carry one canteen with the purification pills so that we're in for
[01:31:18] several days like with Echo 4. But at the first day, we had gone through some water
[01:31:23] and took we all took a turn going into the little stream put the purification
[01:31:28] pills in hit the water and let it sit for a couple of hours before you
[01:31:32] drank it. Did you get acclimated where you needed less water? Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:31:36] Less water and I can truly say I never defecate and lay us.
[01:31:42] Somehow the body just tightened up and they had no ship pills that guys would
[01:31:49] take so they literally would not go to the bathroom. I worried about those.
[01:31:55] Yeah, that wouldn't help me there. Oh, yeah. I was like, anyway, for numerous reasons
[01:32:00] that the creative mind can think about. But so I didn't but my body never had
[01:32:05] and then we never did it. And the you guys didn't.
[01:32:09] Did you guys have you guys did you guys use imagery at all? Like overhead imagery?
[01:32:16] Nothing. No, some of the, uh, uh, the cobras. No, no, some of the first
[01:32:24] calf pillow copters had some, uh, a trying to think what I are. They would have, uh,
[01:32:34] the ability to see through the clouds and stuff. Okay. And it was just a very
[01:32:40] primitive boat beginning, uh, whereas the cobras gunsters didn't have it.
[01:32:44] But the first calf could get low into the jungle and navigate and fog and
[01:32:49] stuff to get down to our guys. But no, you guys wouldn't see photographs of
[01:32:54] the areas where you were going into it all. No, the only time was down in
[01:32:58] the camp, but for that misnare where that was, um, that base was really close to
[01:33:04] Saigon close to Mac Veehead quarters. And, um, we may have had overviews.
[01:33:09] I just forget for up north that one down there. I stuck stuck on my mind.
[01:33:14] And then what was your, what was your optempo like? In other words,
[01:33:18] how often were you going in the field? Well, through an November, December,
[01:33:23] we, if we weren't on the, if we weren't on the ground, we were getting ready to go back
[01:33:28] to next day. That's why it was such a push, push, push, and I rotate our
[01:33:33] little people out because they were just getting beat. And we had trained them up
[01:33:37] so by November, December, all the cross training we had done in those months.
[01:33:41] You know, South could take a day off, uh, even have to take a day off.
[01:33:46] We had a couple of guys that could speak enough English. If anything happened to me
[01:33:50] or Baba, they could take care of the radio due to comms. And, um, so we
[01:33:55] rotate them through. But it was every day. And then, if the weather came,
[01:34:00] we get a break. And, um, so there was no, and the rule that was, if you ran
[01:34:06] on Mission for Five Days, you came back, you got five days off. So you could
[01:34:10] clean up and get back and shape, get the team ready. But for that period of
[01:34:14] time, we had minimal teams. The teams at F will be one had become so
[01:34:19] between disease, um, health, guys getting wiped out, teams getting blown away.
[01:34:26] Um, we were one of the few teams in campus fully operational. So that's why
[01:34:31] that was the other pressure we had. I remember the S3 just saying, hey,
[01:34:35] you're the only guys we got, you're going to see up the noon. Here's your target.
[01:34:39] Go eat. Okay. So we did it. And then we got shot out and come back
[01:34:45] the next day. And so there was no, there's the uptampal was supposed to be
[01:34:51] rather than Mission for Five to Ten Days if you're lucky. Well, it never happened.
[01:34:55] Some guys did. So they'll give me wrong. We had some guys that were able to
[01:34:58] stay on the ground. Amazing. But in our case, we didn't. So it would be
[01:35:03] very flexible. Then you really take less than less than six guys. A few
[01:35:09] guys ran with four. And, uh, at the end of my tour duty, uh, second tour
[01:35:14] I tried to format team, but we had this whole issue with the radio stuff.
[01:35:18] Just so we could move faster. Just wanted to try anything. Something different
[01:35:22] because when we had moved fast, we had success getting away from the LZ
[01:35:26] and that caused them confusion. So if we broke what our SOPs were, it worked.
[01:35:32] But the eight man was too much, too much. I felt more comfortable with six.
[01:35:36] There was a lot of firepower. We had the M79 here. And then all the
[01:35:40] Americans at the M79 too. And then how often would you get legitimate
[01:35:45] R&R? You had one a year at one for a tour duty. You get five days
[01:35:51] anywhere you want it. So I went to Hong Kong bought my stereo
[01:35:55] by a time. It's a book of money set up. But a nice stereo,
[01:35:59] stadium art, set a home to mom and dad. My little brother put it
[01:36:04] together. He was good at that stuff. Yeah. And that's it. Other than that,
[01:36:08] there's no one R&R. If we got net PllaW.
[01:36:12] Then you would have gotten more. Yeah, we would have.
[01:36:16] What was the offer for catching a bad guy?
[01:36:18] An R&R anywhere is nowhere old. And you got a little hundred
[01:36:20] dollars bonus. How many days?
[01:36:22] Five. Like a regular R&R.
[01:36:24] Oh yeah, it was. Oh yeah. That's why we lost it for that man.
[01:36:28] I cried when it's about to say no.
[01:36:31] A hundred bucks. How much was a hundred bucks? How much was your normal paycheck?
[01:36:34] How much you make a month back then?
[01:36:36] Oh, I don't know. When we went through jump school, now I'm only a private
[01:36:41] E1 right. I got a hundred percent pay raise with my jump pay.
[01:36:45] That's getting paid $50 a month. The jump pay was 55.
[01:36:49] So 55 was a constant. Then later maybe E2 was like 75.
[01:36:54] I never paid. It was never enough. So a hundred bucks was like a hundred bucks
[01:36:58] was like a month to pay basically. Yeah, that was a lot of money.
[01:37:01] Even then a scene that was a big deal.
[01:37:04] Absolutely. And then when you guys would come back, you're talking about this.
[01:37:10] How you would sit there in debrief. Would you debrief your team?
[01:37:13] Would you guys sit down in debrief? What happened? What went wrong? What went right?
[01:37:16] We always talk to a little people.
[01:37:18] Maybe not right away because S2 would want to know what happened.
[01:37:22] So we would go in for immediate debrief.
[01:37:25] Go back to team, make sure they had food for the night and stuff.
[01:37:28] And then go back for a final after action report,
[01:37:32] which would go through talking about everything from the vegetation,
[01:37:36] the type of hills, animals you encountered.
[01:37:39] All that kind of just crazy stuff. The fauna.
[01:37:42] Oh my god. The questions to you as it was just,
[01:37:45] if the wild was like always the same.
[01:37:47] It was the layoffs. Yeah, triple canopy.
[01:37:49] It's pretty dangerous. The NBA are pretty dedicated.
[01:37:52] And then anything specific solved the target from that
[01:37:56] to take a learn from. How long are you going to take you to become the one zero?
[01:38:01] Well, in my case, a gotten country in May.
[01:38:06] Despite putting on a team at the end of May, we trained Juniors L.I.
[01:38:10] had a couple in country like L'Oyem, Bush's locally.
[01:38:14] And then we had a practice mission in August.
[01:38:19] And then we did it. First wiretap.
[01:38:21] And not a wiretap, but the Air Force sensors.
[01:38:23] We did two of those missions in September.
[01:38:25] We had them on soon, too.
[01:38:27] So a lot of those little between the rain. We had like weeks.
[01:38:30] We were just rain. It seemed like a rain every day.
[01:38:33] You ever see who horizontal rain?
[01:38:37] Yeah.
[01:38:39] I've seen this much.
[01:38:40] You guys would not run missions during the monsters.
[01:38:42] No.
[01:38:43] You're too much.
[01:38:44] Too much.
[01:38:45] You're going to be too bad.
[01:38:46] You're socked.
[01:38:47] You're socked.
[01:38:48] You couldn't get out of the base.
[01:38:49] The king, he couldn't get to the base.
[01:38:51] So how long, so how long was that?
[01:38:53] Like four months before you were?
[01:38:55] Yeah.
[01:38:56] Four months.
[01:38:57] And how many missions did you run before you were a one zero?
[01:39:02] I had five missions out of my belt.
[01:39:04] We had a two practice, two wiretaps,
[01:39:08] and a dawn, walkin, echo four.
[01:39:11] And by that time, when he came to me, he said,
[01:39:15] you know, walkin got promoted to a cubby rider.
[01:39:18] And because Pat Walkas was leaving,
[01:39:21] there's an opening.
[01:39:22] So he went there and they gave me the option.
[01:39:25] Are you ready?
[01:39:26] Well, we see what happened with Alabama with Lynn Black,
[01:39:29] in October when they put a guy on a team that didn't had no experience.
[01:39:34] So I talked it over with happened south.
[01:39:37] I saw a look just a situation.
[01:39:39] I don't know who they're going to give us.
[01:39:41] So what about I'll be the ones here on spider.
[01:39:44] I thought that was okay to do it.
[01:39:47] Talk to Walkins.
[01:39:48] And they all said, well, you're ready.
[01:39:51] If you want to try it.
[01:39:53] And we didn't know who could they had to do people coming in the camp.
[01:39:57] And some of these guys were the older ones who had no experience in the layoffs.
[01:40:01] But they didn't want to think to do with them.
[01:40:03] And it had some of the younger guys who were coming in.
[01:40:05] Like Jim Robison, who was on the team.
[01:40:09] For one mission.
[01:40:11] And we didn't know how to withstand up.
[01:40:14] So our guys were happy.
[01:40:16] And the bubbly came in.
[01:40:17] Bubba and the guy named Defranceman Doug Leterna,
[01:40:21] the Frenchman came in together.
[01:40:23] And the Frenchman got picked for Virginia.
[01:40:25] And I got Bubba.
[01:40:27] They were buddies. They got me training group together.
[01:40:29] Yeah, that's, yeah.
[01:40:31] So you'd been in the army for like a couple years.
[01:40:35] And you were in charge of a re-conte.
[01:40:39] Yeah, got in the army.
[01:40:40] December 66 became a one-to-year-old October 68.
[01:40:43] So you figure...
[01:40:45] Three years.
[01:40:45] Almost two years, yeah.
[01:40:47] Because the whole SF training, between that and going through basic jump school.
[01:40:52] And then we had that training before Vietnam,
[01:40:55] the RTT training, which was different.
[01:40:58] But that's just because we're common geeks.
[01:41:01] Mm-hmm.
[01:41:02] Oh, the RTT training was just radio.
[01:41:04] Radio tall type. Got it.
[01:41:06] They want a top secret clearance men on those machines.
[01:41:09] How much did you see the tactics that you guys were using?
[01:41:15] Change over time.
[01:41:18] Um, I think by the time, like when you read, we few by Nick Brockhausen.
[01:41:24] Some of those guys were all carrying either RPDs or an M60.
[01:41:30] Mm-hmm.
[01:41:31] So they were just going in heavier.
[01:41:33] And, um, they were going to bigger team.
[01:41:36] Mm-hmm.
[01:41:37] And, um, they were just anticipating the contact more.
[01:41:41] Whereas we thought we were trying to go in and try to escape and evade.
[01:41:45] Mm-hmm.
[01:41:46] To a point where you hope that you can get these some in the mission done.
[01:41:48] Or to get some intel reports about troop movements, trucks, stuff like that.
[01:41:52] Or get a good wiretap.
[01:41:54] So the biggest thing that changed was the guy started going in heavier and actually bringing
[01:41:59] automatic weapons or belt-fed machine guns.
[01:42:03] Sure.
[01:42:04] That makes sense.
[01:42:05] Every single time I read any of your operations,
[01:42:07] I want nothing more than a belt-fed machine gun.
[01:42:11] So the weaves, if we didn't know who's going to carry it.
[01:42:13] Yeah, the seals had the stoner.
[01:42:15] Oh, yeah.
[01:42:16] Did you guys ever think about using that?
[01:42:18] We thought about it a lot.
[01:42:19] But, and it was a great system.
[01:42:21] We heard many great reports about it.
[01:42:24] But again, the stoner system, you need the audio ammo.
[01:42:27] You had to get the supply system set up.
[01:42:30] And we just weren't sure if we were going to be able to get the guarantee.
[01:42:33] If we convert it, who would it be just the Americans?
[01:42:36] We want everybody with common weapons.
[01:42:39] So that somebody who's blown up, they're weapon,
[01:42:41] because they know how to use the other guy's weapon.
[01:42:44] And you have the same magazine saying that.
[01:42:46] Everything.
[01:42:47] Sure.
[01:42:48] And what about the mission set itself?
[01:42:53] Did you guys, did you notice that change over time while you were there?
[01:42:59] Later we began to get more point targets like in on a ground.
[01:43:03] One of my favorite stories was the Frenchman.
[01:43:06] He goes into a seal-type mission.
[01:43:10] The CIA comes and says, we know about the NVA.
[01:43:13] They're floating 55 gallon drums down the river
[01:43:17] and to a storage area.
[01:43:19] Deep and lay us.
[01:43:21] So we want you guys to go in.
[01:43:23] But we don't trust you with the device.
[01:43:25] They had a device that they screwed into a 55 gallon drum.
[01:43:29] So what we're going to do is,
[01:43:31] and that would be like a tracking device?
[01:43:33] No, no, explosive in nature.
[01:43:35] Oh, that's right. That's right.
[01:43:36] Yeah, that's okay.
[01:43:37] So here's what says, we're going to meet you on this hilltop in Lay Us.
[01:43:42] So Doug was the one-one on our TV Junior.
[01:43:46] Got their wall was the one-zero.
[01:43:48] They'd go in and hump three days.
[01:43:50] Get to the mountaintop.
[01:43:51] There's the CIA.
[01:43:53] With a couple guys.
[01:43:54] Okay, here's your device.
[01:43:56] Go and stall it.
[01:43:58] Now, come to the wall with the Marine. So you think that he'd be the guy doing a swimming, right?
[01:44:02] He goes, omınise six.
[01:44:04] Frenchman, you're an E4.
[01:44:06] Hit the work.
[01:44:08] So the CIA gave the Disclosive device,
[01:44:10] humped down the mount and get to the river
[01:44:12] and then now they're on a river with all the stuff going by the drums.
[01:44:16] And some have NVA troops riding the drums
[01:44:20] or being present with a boat or something.
[01:44:22] So in between all this, Doug strips down,
[01:44:25] goes in, gets a drum, brings it back, puts in the explosive device.
[01:44:29] Swims it back out and comes back, soaking wet and not happy.
[01:44:35] He's for something California.
[01:44:38] So he's really not happy.
[01:44:40] But two days later, they're getting extracted now.
[01:44:44] The King Beast come extracted and they're getting
[01:44:47] the extracted as his use explosion.
[01:44:50] And it had sonic boom that Lily moved the aircraft
[01:44:54] and the guys running the strings swinging from the sonic boom
[01:44:57] look back there goes a fuel dump.
[01:45:00] Wow.
[01:45:01] Beautiful mission.
[01:45:02] Yeah, that's true.
[01:45:03] So those are kind.
[01:45:04] So the point mission, the wire taps, you can
[01:45:06] pipe lines, we have more reports of pipe lines.
[01:45:09] And then also there are doing some trail work trying to figure out
[01:45:12] how to look like a beer stream.
[01:45:15] But they had things, that's one of our missions of what the work
[01:45:18] of the mission.
[01:45:19] Yeah.
[01:45:20] To get in there to see how to go into the food,
[01:45:22] putter and could you go in and while you're there,
[01:45:24] blow it up, maybe with a chuck on it.
[01:45:26] Sure.
[01:45:27] Let's talk a little bit about gear.
[01:45:31] And you put, you actually have a section in saw
[01:45:34] Chronicles and it's in across defense too, where you talk about
[01:45:36] stuff you carry and stuff that you didn't carry.
[01:45:39] And some of the stuff that you didn't carry.
[01:45:42] No underwear.
[01:45:44] Never.
[01:45:45] No socks.
[01:45:46] Never.
[01:45:47] And that's because you just want to stay dry as much as
[01:45:51] possible.
[01:45:52] Yeah.
[01:45:53] And both those things just hold water and keep moisture in.
[01:45:56] Yeah.
[01:45:57] And then black when he came,
[01:46:00] or had a maid that was stealing all my underwear.
[01:46:03] Because I went over with eight or ten pair of the
[01:46:05] jockey shorts, right?
[01:46:07] And so I was down on my last pair.
[01:46:10] And the maid was literally stealing, could they
[01:46:12] sell one of black market, they're relatively clean,
[01:46:14] relatively new.
[01:46:15] Mom bought me a whole bunch of stuff with socks and everything.
[01:46:18] So we had our army socks.
[01:46:20] So anyways, I talked to the men.
[01:46:22] I said, I can't believe my maid's been stealing my underwear.
[01:46:25] Because we pulled down in a little eye down.
[01:46:27] There's my underwear.
[01:46:28] So I said, here, take the last one, have a good day.
[01:46:31] And lingo, don't wear that stuff because you get
[01:46:33] jungle rotten, crotch rot.
[01:46:35] And he says same thing, put away your socks.
[01:46:39] Well, you know, it first couple weeks, the jungle boots were
[01:46:42] really tough on my feet, but he was right.
[01:46:44] Yeah, once you get a bunch of your feet broken in and
[01:46:46] you jungle boots broken in.
[01:46:47] Yeah.
[01:46:48] And then say, you go through the water, we did some very
[01:46:51] in country stuff.
[01:46:52] We were in the rice patties.
[01:46:53] Oh my God.
[01:46:54] But they would dry out quicker.
[01:46:56] You'd have to worry about the socks.
[01:46:58] So no helmet.
[01:47:00] Never.
[01:47:01] No body armor.
[01:47:02] No, and your body armor sucked back.
[01:47:04] It sucked back.
[01:47:05] That was big.
[01:47:06] You just have you a different level.
[01:47:07] It didn't work.
[01:47:08] No entrenching tool.
[01:47:12] Never.
[01:47:13] No bay in that.
[01:47:16] No sleeping bag.
[01:47:18] No hammock.
[01:47:19] No poncho.
[01:47:20] No poncho.
[01:47:21] No ground bat.
[01:47:22] Correct.
[01:47:23] You were not traveling for comfort.
[01:47:24] Never.
[01:47:25] We had to carry it.
[01:47:27] Did you know that feeling?
[01:47:29] Yeah.
[01:47:30] What you're taking to the field, your carrying.
[01:47:32] You don't have your maverick.
[01:47:33] Yeah.
[01:47:34] That that rucksack gets heavy too.
[01:47:36] So quick.
[01:47:37] Yeah.
[01:47:38] And ours is like small.
[01:47:40] We had the indigenous rucksacks.
[01:47:42] Uh huh.
[01:47:43] And so you want you put the radio and put the sweater on the
[01:47:45] needle radio.
[01:47:46] So it protect your back.
[01:47:48] And they throw some rations.
[01:47:49] Extra couple of extra amma magazines in there.
[01:47:53] And then extra hand grenades.
[01:47:55] I'm setting on rounds.
[01:47:57] And a battery for good luck.
[01:47:59] Man.
[01:48:00] Yeah.
[01:48:01] You guys.
[01:48:03] No dog tags.
[01:48:04] No military idea of any kind.
[01:48:06] No rank.
[01:48:07] No name tags.
[01:48:08] No jump.
[01:48:09] No C.I.B.
[01:48:10] No patches.
[01:48:11] No unit identified.
[01:48:12] No pictures.
[01:48:13] No mama.
[01:48:14] Right.
[01:48:15] Totally select.
[01:48:16] So those are the things you didn't carry.
[01:48:18] Things you didn't carry.
[01:48:19] Car 15.
[01:48:20] Uh love it.
[01:48:21] You love the car 15.
[01:48:22] Oh yeah.
[01:48:23] So back my second tour.
[01:48:25] Rock Myers was in S4.
[01:48:26] He's he been wounded.
[01:48:29] I came back.
[01:48:30] He says you're back.
[01:48:31] I got a present for you.
[01:48:32] He gave me a brand new car 15.
[01:48:34] I was stolen the box.
[01:48:35] Take it out.
[01:48:36] It's stolen it all the 10 foil and all the oils and grease isn't stuff.
[01:48:39] And you take it out.
[01:48:40] Took it down through range.
[01:48:41] It was perfectly zero.
[01:48:42] Never touched that one.
[01:48:43] It was crazy.
[01:48:44] Just put a little claw strap on it and went to work.
[01:48:48] And you never had problems with that weapon.
[01:48:51] Never.
[01:48:52] Yeah.
[01:48:53] Did you have a four to six on it?
[01:48:56] Yep.
[01:48:57] Six four to six.
[01:48:58] Yeah.
[01:48:59] So that was a car 15.
[01:49:01] Wow.
[01:49:02] So the M16 with it with a classable stock.
[01:49:04] Yeah.
[01:49:05] And a shortened barrel.
[01:49:06] Yeah.
[01:49:07] So it's weird so many people and myself being one of them complain about the car.
[01:49:11] The car 15 or the M4 frame.
[01:49:14] Now the M4 is our lot nicer.
[01:49:15] I mean, the M4.
[01:49:16] Well, a lot heavier too.
[01:49:17] You got to reels and everything.
[01:49:18] Oh yeah.
[01:49:19] We put the light note thing.
[01:49:20] Those are the same.
[01:49:21] You got everything but a cigarette lighter on here.
[01:49:23] Some guys I would've resized it and then that on there too.
[01:49:27] So that's awesome.
[01:49:28] You used the Kravat for your sling.
[01:49:30] Yes.
[01:49:31] So I thought, well, yeah.
[01:49:32] I did that door my second door.
[01:49:34] They had the Kravat's quiet.
[01:49:36] And then God forbid if you ever needed a Kravat.
[01:49:40] Mm-hmm.
[01:49:41] Because I was carried out.
[01:49:42] I always wore a run around my neck.
[01:49:43] I had one on my head.
[01:49:45] And then one on the car 15.
[01:49:46] And of course you carried bandages.
[01:49:48] Yeah.
[01:49:49] We had Kravats in case it.
[01:49:50] As at the very bottom of the rock sack.
[01:49:51] We would get a sort of one of those things.
[01:49:55] They'd never wear a sling.
[01:49:57] Some guys would say that.
[01:49:58] Get caught up.
[01:49:59] And that's just man, especially when you're in a leadership position.
[01:50:03] You need a sling.
[01:50:04] Because you got to look at your map.
[01:50:05] You got to pull out.
[01:50:06] You know.
[01:50:07] Yeah.
[01:50:08] You got to do stuff.
[01:50:09] You don't have a sling and you get blown up.
[01:50:11] Yeah.
[01:50:12] Where's your weapon?
[01:50:13] You have no idea when you wake up.
[01:50:15] No.
[01:50:16] Yeah.
[01:50:17] But then there's some, you know, some people just they wouldn't carry a sling.
[01:50:21] Mark leaves one of my shing on her sheep.
[01:50:23] Just no sling.
[01:50:24] No.
[01:50:25] That was like a man thing to do was no sling.
[01:50:26] Yeah.
[01:50:27] On her 1060.
[01:50:28] Or these days of Mark 48.
[01:50:30] Really?
[01:50:31] Yeah.
[01:50:32] How strong is this guy?
[01:50:33] Strong.
[01:50:34] Yeah.
[01:50:35] Strong.
[01:50:36] M-79.
[01:50:37] You carried.
[01:50:38] Sawdolph.
[01:50:39] Oh, yes.
[01:50:40] I cannot believe that me and my guy is the not-thinker sawdolph for him.
[01:50:44] Yeah.
[01:50:45] It's like guaranteed guys with the sawdolph.
[01:50:46] Yeah.
[01:50:47] My first self-inflicted room was from a sawdolph M79.
[01:50:50] What'd you do?
[01:50:51] Well, we're in a process.
[01:50:53] We're cutting them down.
[01:50:54] Uh-huh.
[01:50:55] So the question was how far he cut the barrel down.
[01:50:57] So we finally cut it right down to the last hinge.
[01:51:00] Mm-hmm.
[01:51:01] We're.
[01:51:02] It's the last one.
[01:51:03] That's, yeah.
[01:51:04] That's to the bottom of the frame.
[01:51:06] Got it.
[01:51:07] Yeah.
[01:51:08] So we, we kept bringing it back.
[01:51:10] So we're down to range.
[01:51:11] We're there.
[01:51:12] And the question was because you cut the barrel off.
[01:51:15] It needs the number of rotations.
[01:51:17] Yeah.
[01:51:18] Now our, our weapons guys knew that.
[01:51:20] But I was mean, Rick Howard, we're common guys.
[01:51:22] And I didn't really ask.
[01:51:23] It's just the question was fire and sea.
[01:51:25] So on this day, I fired, fairly close.
[01:51:29] It goes being, you know,
[01:51:32] I know he's inside of the night makes.
[01:51:34] And then it went all like pop,
[01:51:35] being like that.
[01:51:37] And I go, oh, damn.
[01:51:39] So I go to Rick Howard.
[01:51:40] I think a bead just hit me.
[01:51:42] Pull my strip.
[01:51:43] He dumbass.
[01:51:44] He just shot yourself.
[01:51:45] My first self inflicted moon.
[01:51:47] But the good news was that I'm sitting on work.
[01:51:49] And they caused you to cut the handle down to just have enough
[01:51:52] to you could hold on to.
[01:51:54] Because that way is less less weapon.
[01:51:56] Yeah.
[01:51:57] He's to how long the firepower.
[01:51:58] Oh, yeah.
[01:51:59] I caught that weapon down by half.
[01:52:01] Oh, yeah.
[01:52:02] I was looking at the pictures you have.
[01:52:03] It's, that thing is tiny.
[01:52:05] Tiny but effective.
[01:52:07] Charlie hated those things.
[01:52:09] And at one point you had a, you had a holster for that thing.
[01:52:12] Yeah.
[01:52:13] That's John Wayne.
[01:52:14] That's the, that's the one layoffs with my,
[01:52:16] a dog knife.
[01:52:17] And I had somebody had crafted it.
[01:52:20] And I put it on.
[01:52:21] Yeah, that was perfect.
[01:52:23] Yeah.
[01:52:24] But never had a double.
[01:52:25] For that point, I just like everybody else.
[01:52:27] We just carried it on the deering.
[01:52:30] We taped it so it would be quiet though.
[01:52:32] You carried 34 20 round mags.
[01:52:36] Each pat, each with 18 rounds each.
[01:52:38] So that's 612 rounds for good luck.
[01:52:41] Yeah.
[01:52:42] That's not the only character or like a pouts with a couple extra clips.
[01:52:47] And in case we needed to reload the 34 magazines.
[01:52:50] And you went on.
[01:52:52] You mentioned you had few missions where you were down to your last one or two.
[01:52:56] At least twice that I remember echo four was the first time.
[01:52:59] Did you always hang onto your magazines when you were out?
[01:53:04] At dependent on the degree of intensity of the firefight.
[01:53:08] If I had time, we keep us for a happy.
[01:53:11] I'll bring back my damn magazines.
[01:53:13] Did you stuff from your shirt?
[01:53:14] Yeah.
[01:53:15] Yeah.
[01:53:16] Because the web gear would be tight.
[01:53:18] So our jungle fatigue were out.
[01:53:22] Yeah.
[01:53:23] So you had the pants, but then the harness from the web gear.
[01:53:27] Yeah.
[01:53:28] And the web gear would be the only thing in.
[01:53:29] When I came in, we'd stuff mags in our shirt.
[01:53:32] And then, but with body armor, you can't do that.
[01:53:35] So now that's carry like pouches or just dropping their leg cargo pockets or whatever.
[01:53:39] Yeah.
[01:53:40] Our preferred thing would be AR belts because you could put four magazines in and one
[01:53:44] across the top.
[01:53:45] And it was a nice pouch.
[01:53:46] The AR belts that they have from World War II.
[01:53:49] Perfect for the 20 round magazines.
[01:53:53] That's a lot of, just, you know, we would normally carry.
[01:53:56] Seven to ten, 30 round mags.
[01:54:00] So we carry like, I mean, sometimes I guess more than that, but not no 600 rounds.
[01:54:06] But you weren't just being alone for a while.
[01:54:08] No, we weren't fighting divisions worth the people either.
[01:54:11] So I mean, yeah.
[01:54:14] You know, and I guess we did what we did have is we always had heavy machine guns.
[01:54:18] You know, so that makes a big difference too.
[01:54:20] I guess, you know, we would have Mark 48, which is 762 and then the Mark 46, which is
[01:54:25] 556, you know, that's basically like a little stoner and a and a and 60.
[01:54:31] The modern versions of those two things.
[01:54:33] But yeah, you know, so we had a sol 2, right?
[01:54:35] Yeah, well, that's the Mark 46 is a saw.
[01:54:38] Yeah.
[01:54:39] Okay.
[01:54:39] Yeah.
[01:54:40] Yes.
[01:54:41] So we had those and those guys would carry a lot of rounds, a lot of rounds, like 800
[01:54:46] 2000, sometimes more on the outside.
[01:54:48] Yeah, what's tough on the character like that over a thousand.
[01:54:51] Yeah.
[01:54:52] And I had guys go winchester, go run out of bullets.
[01:54:56] Really?
[01:54:57] Yeah.
[01:54:57] With that many.
[01:54:58] So yeah, I guess maybe that was the the differentiator.
[01:55:02] You carry 10 to 12 fragments.
[01:55:07] That's a lot of fragments.
[01:55:09] I guess when you're going taking fights with divisions, you got to carry a lot of
[01:55:12] Frag grenades.
[01:55:13] Oh, yeah.
[01:55:14] And it always kept the last one.
[01:55:16] That was one up here.
[01:55:18] Just in case.
[01:55:19] I must be a POW.
[01:55:20] Oh, yeah.
[01:55:22] Absolutely.
[01:55:24] We would carry, I don't know.
[01:55:27] Well, I would carry like one or two.
[01:55:30] Well, how often would you be?
[01:55:31] I just got left at that.
[01:55:32] It's official.
[01:55:33] Sure.
[01:55:34] I don't laugh that.
[01:55:35] How often would you, how often would you be more than two of them?
[01:55:38] Hopefully never.
[01:55:39] Yeah.
[01:55:40] You know, and especially I'm going to leadership position.
[01:55:42] I'm hopefully not the hucking grenades.
[01:55:45] But, uh, yeah.
[01:55:47] Yeah.
[01:55:51] No, you know, the big difference, especially in Romadi.
[01:55:53] I mean, in Romadi, I remember explaining to the guys that relieved us.
[01:55:56] You know, we had a big overhead imagery.
[01:55:59] Yeah.
[01:56:00] And I put my hand on the map.
[01:56:01] And I said, no matter where you put your hand on this map, you'll be touching
[01:56:04] up front of the unit.
[01:56:06] So like, and you know, this is, you know, probably within three to 500 meters of view.
[01:56:09] Anywhere you were in Romadi, yours are from the unit.
[01:56:12] Really.
[01:56:13] So that's why, you know, you were going to get reinforcements.
[01:56:15] You were going to get tanks.
[01:56:16] Yeah, but in between that time, you earned your pay.
[01:56:18] Yeah.
[01:56:19] After earn your pay.
[01:56:20] Yeah.
[01:56:22] Yeah.
[01:56:23] I was talking to late, late, late, late.
[01:56:24] Well, late, that's another thing.
[01:56:25] So it's late.
[01:56:26] Late, it's got a chapter in dichotomy and leadership.
[01:56:28] Where he's talking about preparing, over preparing for too many contingencies.
[01:56:33] He talks about, it was his first patrol out on, out going out with a Marine Corps
[01:56:38] in a daytime patrol.
[01:56:39] And he's talking about how much stuff he cared,
[01:56:41] all this stuff for one of the thing he cared is, you know, eight grenades or something like that.
[01:56:45] And, you know, he reflects on how that was just way too many of us like, hey man,
[01:56:52] you know, tilt, go out and the field will less than 10.
[01:56:55] So the different AO, different AO, different AO.
[01:57:00] We probably would have adjusted our grenades.
[01:57:02] I wonder how much you would have changed if you had to wear body armor.
[01:57:05] Or if you would have decided not to or whatever.
[01:57:08] You know, it's interesting.
[01:57:09] That's an interesting development.
[01:57:10] I'll tell you, if we even had today's stadium art,
[01:57:13] a never would have worn it.
[01:57:15] It's just too much weight.
[01:57:16] And you had to be able to move, I mean, you know,
[01:57:19] you have to mention, you're so damn lucky, you know, bullets are gonna hit you.
[01:57:22] Yeah.
[01:57:23] That's why I crawled a lot, try to keep the low profile.
[01:57:28] But now I probably would have declined it because of the weight as it was.
[01:57:34] In our AO, maybe another AO with different situations,
[01:57:39] more flexibility with assets.
[01:57:42] And the thing that's interesting is, one of the reasons why you wear a helmet now
[01:57:47] isn't just to protect your head, it's because that's where your nads mount onto.
[01:57:50] Your night vision.
[01:57:51] Oh, yeah.
[01:57:52] Your night vision mount onto your.
[01:57:53] So you, they do have a contraption that's like a headband looking thing.
[01:57:57] I don't think they make it anymore.
[01:57:58] But, but where you could wear that, but, you know, your nads mount on your.
[01:58:02] Your night vision mounts on your helmet.
[01:58:04] That's just the way it is.
[01:58:05] I've seen no silo.
[01:58:06] Yeah, that's what it got.
[01:58:07] It's a cool.
[01:58:08] I want one.
[01:58:09] Yeah.
[01:58:10] That's good time when those dots flip down.
[01:58:12] All right.
[01:58:13] But instead of wearing a helmet, you wore a crevat.
[01:58:16] The green crevat on your head, one around your neck.
[01:58:20] You had you wore regular army for teagues.
[01:58:23] Yeah, there is sterile for teagues that had two pucks at the top of the angle.
[01:58:29] And two pockets down here to hang out.
[01:58:32] And then we customized them.
[01:58:34] And we had the the tailor put in pockets here.
[01:58:38] And so for mirrors, maps, morphine, serbets,
[01:58:41] it's all close right here.
[01:58:43] And then we had a pockets on each arm.
[01:58:46] To put other things up there were pinflares.
[01:58:49] Other things are good.
[01:58:51] And that's something that we did too.
[01:58:53] So we did even before even in the 90s before the everyone.
[01:58:56] Because now the fatigue's come issued with pockets on the arms.
[01:59:00] I think, but we used to take them off and so on.
[01:59:03] And that's where you keep your your pants and your notebooks and your pen flares.
[01:59:07] And you're, and you're signal mirror.
[01:59:09] Yeah.
[01:59:10] And then on the ones on your chest, you had maps and morphine,
[01:59:12] you had extra notebook.
[01:59:13] Your URC 10 emergency radio.
[01:59:16] And then you had a, you wore a watch of sake.
[01:59:20] Yeah.
[01:59:21] Illuminus watch.
[01:59:23] You wore gloves.
[01:59:25] Always.
[01:59:26] Just cut out the thumb index finger,
[01:59:29] then the middle finger just cut it to the tip.
[01:59:32] So you grabbed tape on the magazine sort of firefights.
[01:59:35] Same thing, same thing we would do.
[01:59:36] But you always work gloves otherwise your hands are just getting destroyed.
[01:59:39] Oh, the jungle.
[01:59:40] Forget about it.
[01:59:41] Yeah.
[01:59:41] Because a lot of times we wind up, you have to get a new pair of gloves.
[01:59:45] We just get torn up so much on the genre and fatigues.
[01:59:49] Man, it was a weight of weight of an event and a thorns.
[01:59:53] Because you know, they're a weight of a minute.
[01:59:55] You get caught into it.
[01:59:57] You walk into it.
[01:59:58] Your leg goes into the pins that's coming together.
[02:00:01] So you had to stop and then get the pin to get your leg.
[02:00:04] Otherwise it goes to the pin.
[02:00:05] Otherwise it goes deeper into your leg.
[02:00:08] What about did you carry any kind of mosquito net for your head?
[02:00:11] No.
[02:00:12] How come?
[02:00:13] Never thought about it.
[02:00:15] Mosquito net for the head.
[02:00:16] Yeah.
[02:00:17] Well, I used to, this was like the most brilliant thing.
[02:00:20] I think it was an Australian guy.
[02:00:21] So I told me this.
[02:00:22] You, I would have like a little square of mosquito netting.
[02:00:25] Hmm.
[02:00:26] And when we would stop patrolling,
[02:00:29] I would take out that little square, put it over my head.
[02:00:32] Right over my right over my floppy hat.
[02:00:34] And talk it in and all of a sudden you knocking chewed apart by mosquitoes.
[02:00:38] Oh yeah, one night, one time we did a practice mission.
[02:00:42] East of the actual.
[02:00:43] And the morning I couldn't, I couldn't open my eyes.
[02:00:46] I had been bitten so much by mosquitoes.
[02:00:48] My face was puffed out.
[02:00:50] You need that mosquito net.
[02:00:51] I needed to help.
[02:00:52] Had I only known.
[02:00:54] I just got a fall of that.
[02:00:55] I just got a thought about that one.
[02:00:57] I had a guy we were doing some training.
[02:00:59] And none of us had mosquito netting except for the officer.
[02:01:03] And so the officer was sleeping hardly.
[02:01:05] Like just fully.
[02:01:06] And one of the other young listed guys was catching mosquitoes.
[02:01:11] And putting them inside this guy's body was asleep.
[02:01:15] He woke up coming.
[02:01:18] But not like those mosquitoes were trapped in there with them.
[02:01:21] They were trapped in there.
[02:01:22] And they couldn't get out.
[02:01:23] They were just having a feast.
[02:01:24] Trapped hungry mosquitoes.
[02:01:25] Trapped hungry mosquitoes.
[02:01:26] Yeah.
[02:01:27] Yeah.
[02:01:28] So, but note not for you.
[02:01:29] No mosquito net.
[02:01:30] No.
[02:01:31] I hadn't thought about that one.
[02:01:34] Leachers.
[02:01:35] Oh.
[02:01:36] You guys ran into a lot of leaches.
[02:01:39] Always.
[02:01:40] Yeah, we had a bug repellent for that.
[02:01:43] It's even really the bug repellent on them once you got sucked on by a leach.
[02:01:46] Yeah.
[02:01:47] They would instantly fall off.
[02:01:48] But you always try to wait.
[02:01:49] Try to just see if you could jiggle them off because you knew the bug repellent could be smelt.
[02:01:55] Hmm.
[02:01:56] By the bad guys.
[02:01:57] So.
[02:01:58] Hmm.
[02:01:59] Then you had your on your web gear, which was the old World War II web gear.
[02:02:04] You had on your left harness.
[02:02:05] You had your K bar.
[02:02:06] Handled down.
[02:02:07] Or a sock knife.
[02:02:08] Or a sock knife until you lost it.
[02:02:10] Tue love.
[02:02:11] That's what we need to do.
[02:02:14] A recovery mission for get the sock knife back.
[02:02:17] Yes.
[02:02:18] Handled down.
[02:02:21] Sure.
[02:02:22] That's how you rolled.
[02:02:23] Yeah, because this way you pulled out your ready.
[02:02:25] Hmm.
[02:02:26] It's a period to pull out the jungle. You might cut up in the vines.
[02:02:29] Got it. Got it.
[02:02:32] You had hand grenades there because you were basically covered in hand grenades.
[02:02:36] Oh yeah.
[02:02:38] Smoke.
[02:02:39] You had there. You had some some, you know, bandages there.
[02:02:43] On your right harness. You had your strobe light.
[02:02:45] You had more hand grenades.
[02:02:47] You had your D-ring.
[02:02:49] And you had more smoke grenades.
[02:02:52] Then on your belt.
[02:02:54] You had one canteen usually.
[02:02:57] It depends on the target. Sometimes it'd be maybe two.
[02:03:01] But usually one and then one I had a second one in my backpack.
[02:03:05] Rocksack.
[02:03:06] You normally wouldn't get, would you get thirsty?
[02:03:08] Was there normally enough water?
[02:03:10] Uh, and the jungle wasn't as bad as Cambodia.
[02:03:13] So, but yeah, you get thirsty because you're hopping up and down.
[02:03:17] Um, there's a couple times we particularly in that day.
[02:03:20] We went straight up with the orchards.
[02:03:22] That was a day we got, we were all out of water.
[02:03:25] Not fun.
[02:03:27] No.
[02:03:28] So you had one canteen. You had a Willie Pete grenade.
[02:03:30] We had your survival axe.
[02:03:32] Which was the Frankenwarren survival axe type two.
[02:03:36] Indeed.
[02:03:37] That's what I wanted.
[02:03:38] I wanted to type two.
[02:03:40] I looked him up and had like a hook at the top.
[02:03:44] Yeah.
[02:03:45] Another play you went through.
[02:03:46] When you came back on the, on the back pool,
[02:03:48] you could try to make it effective to cut a, particularly cutting vines.
[02:03:53] That thing came with you all the time.
[02:03:55] Every mission.
[02:03:57] I got a home under my desk right now.
[02:03:59] In case any true comes in, I'm ready.
[02:04:01] I like it.
[02:04:02] Ha ha ha ha.
[02:04:04] So if you're in true there's feeling lucky.
[02:04:06] Yeah, luck.
[02:04:07] Meet Mr. Till.
[02:04:09] I compass around your neck.
[02:04:11] You used to carve out for your belt.
[02:04:14] Yes.
[02:04:15] So the belt I was talking about before is that we're built of your web gear.
[02:04:17] But just the part of your pants was just a, was a cravat.
[02:04:20] You cared to swiss army knife.
[02:04:22] You cared a gas mask.
[02:04:24] Always.
[02:04:25] You always cared a gas mask.
[02:04:27] How we had teams that got hit and the A camps that have been hit by the enemy used to.
[02:04:32] Yes.
[02:04:33] Sure.
[02:04:34] And they used.
[02:04:35] I forget what the, the instance were, but there were a couple times that the enemy had used gas on our people in
[02:04:42] the US as well as with the CIA operation. We weren't told that.
[02:04:47] But we had cold evidence that they had done it.
[02:04:51] And that they could hit one of our recontinues.
[02:04:53] So we had to carry that bulky, yes thing at all times.
[02:04:56] I was going to say, but and this is this was the, the, the concern was tear gas.
[02:05:01] Well tear gas or who else knows what they had.
[02:05:04] I mean, these are common.
[02:05:05] It's done to play by rules of engagement.
[02:05:07] I mean, they're not in the lails.
[02:05:09] Because yeah, that's your opinion.
[02:05:10] I was thinking with all this crap that you're carrying.
[02:05:12] And a gas mask or just huge and bulky.
[02:05:15] Yeah, left hip.
[02:05:17] I don't know if that all the time.
[02:05:18] Had to.
[02:05:19] And we used them twice.
[02:05:21] And we, in fact, we had designed a mission.
[02:05:25] One of our missions was to.
[02:05:28] When we got a stractive from a target an M.A. target,
[02:05:32] we saw a road to had.
[02:05:35] A little guard station, a guard station.
[02:05:39] But it was north of the DMC river.
[02:05:42] So the quest for getting.
[02:05:45] A live POW.
[02:05:47] We found out that we had one of our guys that did a VR and flew a couple of rules.
[02:05:52] And they saw these little waste stations along the way.
[02:05:54] So our thought was, we'll get gas.
[02:05:57] Gas.
[02:05:58] And they said they had a knockout gas at the time, right?
[02:06:01] So we practiced for a couple of days with tear gas.
[02:06:05] And we had to get the helicopter piles and the gun crews.
[02:06:08] Everybody would their masks and then have masks that they could talk to each other.
[02:06:11] And then talk to us.
[02:06:13] And so we practiced for several days training with the helicopters coming in.
[02:06:18] And the mission plan was go up.
[02:06:21] In the middle of the day.
[02:06:23] Go to one of those camps.
[02:06:24] Hit it.
[02:06:25] Gas it.
[02:06:26] Go in and scarf.
[02:06:27] And go home.
[02:06:28] Get a five day pass.
[02:06:29] 100 bucks.
[02:06:30] Yeah.
[02:06:31] But they had a special knockout gas that was supposed to use.
[02:06:34] And at the end they wouldn't let us.
[02:06:36] They wouldn't give us the gas.
[02:06:38] I don't know if they had it.
[02:06:39] But they wouldn't give us the knockout gas.
[02:06:42] So another mission came up.
[02:06:44] We had a bright light around and we never got back to the concept of doing it.
[02:06:48] And you carried.
[02:06:49] You usually carried one grenade for your 40 mic mic.
[02:06:52] That was tear gas.
[02:06:53] Always.
[02:06:54] Sure.
[02:06:55] Kiss me needed it.
[02:06:56] And that was what would your what would your tactic be on using that?
[02:06:59] And usually it would be to.
[02:07:02] You know, to create this order.
[02:07:05] Because he hit somebody with tear gas.
[02:07:07] If it's far away.
[02:07:09] That would distract him for a second.
[02:07:12] Take their mind off a business.
[02:07:13] Or at least make them have a hard time to kill us.
[02:07:16] And we also carried a grass a gas grenade local.
[02:07:20] Okay.
[02:07:21] So we had in our SOP.
[02:07:23] A procedure that the word or I figured that was.
[02:07:26] But we had a signal or a sign for CS gas.
[02:07:30] So if we're getting so overrun to where the pop of CS to break the charg with some of our teams did.
[02:07:37] They used it in an operation tailwind quite effectively saved your bacon.
[02:07:42] So the idea would be hey, this is going to.
[02:07:45] Linger whereas a frag grenade goes off.
[02:07:48] You either wound guys or you don't.
[02:07:49] You either kill guys or you don't.
[02:07:50] But that's it.
[02:07:51] It's over.
[02:07:52] Yeah.
[02:07:52] Whereas gas.
[02:07:53] You can really disrupt them because now you got guys coughing and you can.
[02:07:57] Yeah.
[02:07:58] Puking and whatever.
[02:07:59] And it's and it hangs to the ground and then it hangs around as long as the wind's.
[02:08:02] It's going to let it hang around.
[02:08:04] Got it.
[02:08:05] Left pant pocket.
[02:08:07] You had a marking panel large and small.
[02:08:09] Right pant pocket.
[02:08:11] Pen flares.
[02:08:12] Dehydrated lyrp ration.
[02:08:15] Bug repellent for leeches.
[02:08:17] An extra covat.
[02:08:18] An extra bandage.
[02:08:19] Did anybody carry IV?
[02:08:21] A silver or a guy's did.
[02:08:24] Okay.
[02:08:25] Lim black did and.
[02:08:27] We had.
[02:08:29] I think South carry one of our in ditch carry one we had an IV and the.
[02:08:34] St.line solution that came in a canister.
[02:08:37] So it always had one in case we needed.
[02:08:39] Mm-hmm.
[02:08:40] In your rock sack.
[02:08:42] You got your you got your PRC 25.
[02:08:45] Which you guys called the prick 25.
[02:08:47] Yeah.
[02:08:48] I think I was I think I was outlawed from calling it a prick.
[02:08:50] That that PRC 25.
[02:08:52] So the PRC 25 was replaced by the PR77 the.
[02:08:57] Pro 77 and I was let us say it was 1969 or something like that when I got the
[02:09:02] Seal team one that's what I used was a few is one of the radios that we had in our story
[02:09:06] It was a PRC 7.
[02:09:07] Yeah.
[02:09:08] Which came directly from the PRC 25.
[02:09:10] So you'd carry that you had the big whip antenna but you wouldn't you have the little
[02:09:14] tape antenna on there so you don't right identified as the radio guy because otherwise you could
[02:09:18] it.
[02:09:21] Yeah.
[02:09:22] Yeah.
[02:09:23] Because you just hold it over.
[02:09:25] And in our case the antenna we just get it and bend it down.
[02:09:28] Come and eat your arm and stick it into the fatigue.
[02:09:31] So be low profile on it.
[02:09:33] Then you had your your one C rat of fruit.
[02:09:35] That was like your that was your your go to indeed.
[02:09:39] And you carry one of those two with us.
[02:09:41] I'm like that.
[02:09:42] You just one could after while you know we kept getting shot out so often.
[02:09:47] It's like okay I'm not too much weight.
[02:09:50] Yeah.
[02:09:51] Yeah.
[02:09:52] Yeah.
[02:09:53] You had your extra mags and there you got an extra M79 rounds.
[02:09:57] You had your army long sleeve sweater.
[02:10:00] You had a plastic rain jacket.
[02:10:02] Toilet paper even though you apparently never used it.
[02:10:05] Correct.
[02:10:06] But you've also used it the pack wounds.
[02:10:08] There you go.
[02:10:09] Extra battery.
[02:10:11] For the for the prick 25 and the URC 10.
[02:10:16] Extra smoke grenades.
[02:10:19] Extra cantina water.
[02:10:21] Extra ration.
[02:10:22] And then you had your clay more or clay more with five and ten second fuses.
[02:10:28] And on top of that that's 22 caliber hush puppy on some operations sometimes.
[02:10:33] Yeah.
[02:10:34] And all this when you'd weighed yourself you'd be about 90 pounds heavy.
[02:10:37] Right around there.
[02:10:38] Yeah.
[02:10:39] And it was it was an old Rick the S scale.
[02:10:41] So I just jumped on it carrying everything just to see what it was.
[02:10:44] Well that's a heavy load out.
[02:10:46] I'll tell you right now that's a heavy load out.
[02:10:48] That is absolutely all of 90 pounds.
[02:10:51] When you start talking about 600 rounds of ammunition.
[02:10:53] We start talking about 10 to 12 hand grenades smoke smoke grenades are heavy as hell.
[02:10:59] They got all that material in them.
[02:11:01] That's folks.
[02:11:02] Yeah.
[02:11:03] They're big giant beasts.
[02:11:04] And the Willie Peters.
[02:11:05] The Willie Peters.
[02:11:06] Have you do?
[02:11:07] Uh.
[02:11:09] Crazy mouth.
[02:11:12] Um.
[02:11:13] And I guess like I said and like you said you're carrying all that firepower.
[02:11:18] Because the operations you're carrying a crazy amount of firepower because you're doing crazy operations.
[02:11:23] Yeah.
[02:11:24] And again, I'm talking to the other ones.
[02:11:26] You're a Pat Walkins and Montgomery.
[02:11:28] Because initially I don't know what the loads were.
[02:11:30] But they kept increasing.
[02:11:32] And because there was shovel time and they ran out of ammo.
[02:11:35] Already got close to running out.
[02:11:37] And that's the last thing in the world you want.
[02:11:39] You know.
[02:11:40] Yeah.
[02:11:41] Awesome.
[02:11:44] Well, you know, that's a little over two hours right now.
[02:11:49] And it's been a quick night.
[02:11:51] Yeah.
[02:11:52] Indeed.
[02:11:53] But you got any closing thoughts?
[02:11:58] No.
[02:11:59] Just to thank you for having me in three times.
[02:12:03] We've gained some extra depth.
[02:12:05] Like I said before, we were just chatting and said these stories always felt worse
[02:12:10] and more significant in terms of the stories about what Sog did in the men, more importantly men.
[02:12:16] And also like I said to you earlier, my stuff is hairy.
[02:12:20] But if you had a hairy scale on one to ten, I mean, I feel I put myself at a five or six compared to the guys.
[02:12:28] I got the metal boner to guys that didn't come home that went down fighting, getting over run by the NBA.
[02:12:34] And we could just talk about metal boner missions of guys standing there just fighting.
[02:12:39] And they're just fighting off and dying on the LZ, putting their people on the helicopter first.
[02:12:45] John Caddenberg, Johnny Gallon, time and again, RSF guys would take care of the little people we even get them on the chopper, get them out.
[02:12:54] And so those stories I felt was great valor.
[02:12:58] And so I thank you for the little extra pleasure to your audience.
[02:13:02] Well, we appreciate that.
[02:13:03] We'll bring you back on and we'll get, and I know you and I are talking about
[02:13:08] other guys that we're going to come on and all those stories of those heroes will we'll get them out there because
[02:13:15] People want to know I want to hear them.
[02:13:18] I want to know as much as I can about them and and and you know, we'll get you back.
[02:13:24] I'm ready to roll.
[02:13:25] So thank you and I thank you for the time and also you're on a, you're like Mr. social media now.
[02:13:30] I didn't realize that.
[02:13:31] You got to give me a full briefing where it's done.
[02:13:33] So you're on Twitter.
[02:13:35] You're on Twitter.
[02:13:38] You're on Twitter.
[02:13:39] We haven't quite figured out Twitter yet.
[02:13:41] Apparently you're, and makes two of us.
[02:13:43] Your old, your old Twitter handle was at Saga Chronicles.
[02:13:48] Your new Twitter handle is at John Striker Meyer.
[02:13:53] That's, that's where it's at right now.
[02:13:55] Yes, sir.
[02:13:56] That's right.
[02:13:56] All right.
[02:13:57] So people will start trying to communicate with you on that.
[02:14:00] Good luck.
[02:14:02] I'm going to call it a presence. Hey, President Trump. Could you help me out on my Twitter?
[02:14:05] President Trump tweets all the time decaying a Twitter.
[02:14:08] Yeah, yes, yes.
[02:14:10] Hey, I'm sorry.
[02:14:12] You'll be able to, you'll be able to, you'll, you'll, you'll, when you, that's the incredible thing about Twitter.
[02:14:17] Yes.
[02:14:18] Everybody has a platform.
[02:14:19] It's incredibly good.
[02:14:20] Sometimes it's incredibly bad, but everybody has a platform.
[02:14:24] So no, the cool thing about it is people have been, you know,
[02:14:28] talking to me and hitting me up and just thanking you for your service.
[02:14:32] Thank you for coming on.
[02:14:33] Thank you for sharing the story.
[02:14:35] So it'll be cool that they'll be able to actually thank you.
[02:14:37] Instead of just telling me to tell you things.
[02:14:38] I just go to our website.
[02:14:39] They got the link in there for email for the old fast and root.
[02:14:42] Saga Chronicles.com.
[02:14:43] Saga Chronicles.com.
[02:14:44] Have one.
[02:14:45] Yeah, people on there.
[02:14:46] I wanted to close out reading one last thing.
[02:14:49] And this is your, your dedication for the book,
[02:14:52] Saga Chronicles.
[02:14:53] One.
[02:14:54] And it said it says this book is dedicated to the
[02:14:57] Saga Men and their courageous indigenous team members who went across the fence and the
[02:15:01] Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam during the eight year secret war.
[02:15:06] And to the end to the brave aviators and crew members of the army,
[02:15:09] Air Force Marine Corps and our fearless allies from the
[02:15:13] 219th South Vietnamese Air Force's special operation squadron,
[02:15:17] Blegendary Kingbees who supported, who supported,
[02:15:21] Saga teams on the ground.
[02:15:24] This book is also for every man in Saga and the aviators who made the ultimate sacrifice
[02:15:30] far outside the boundaries of conventional Vietnam war that America saw reported on the nightly news.
[02:15:39] I'll give the closing note.
[02:15:41] Today, 1,598 Americans that are MIA and South these days are from the Vietnam war.
[02:15:49] 50 green berets alone in Laos are still MIA, including 140 plus aviators that died
[02:15:57] strictly supporting our mission.
[02:15:59] And this week, the National League of POWMIA found is having a 50th annual meeting in
[02:16:05] Arlington on this topic.
[02:16:08] They've been diligent and the M. Mills Griffiths is the CEO.
[02:16:13] She's putting it all together.
[02:16:14] They work with the Pentagon.
[02:16:16] She'd been on this mission for day one.
[02:16:18] And our prayers are with them to continue because they're pushing to bring our people home.
[02:16:23] Absolutely.
[02:16:24] And if you want to put that out either on Saga Chronicles, put a link to how people can support that cause.
[02:16:30] People will absolutely support that cause.
[02:16:33] Okay.
[02:16:34] We'll do that.
[02:16:35] Absolutely.
[02:16:36] They deserve it.
[02:16:36] Yes, absolutely.
[02:16:37] We can make that happen.
[02:16:38] Wow.
[02:16:39] Thank you.
[02:16:39] Airborne.
[02:16:40] All right. Well, like I said, you haven't opened in invite on here.

[02:17:18] Yeah.
[02:17:19] Sappers.
[02:17:21] Sappers.
[02:17:22] I asked him what Sappers was.
[02:17:24] Workers.
[02:17:25] There's various references.
[02:17:27] First, second, and this past one to Sappers.
[02:17:30] And more notably, one, if you remember, then we'd be preded to the first one.
[02:17:36] He says, Sappers, still Sappers been on a sense.
[02:17:39] I love all of all, whatever that's interesting.
[02:17:41] And I always wondered, what's a Sapper?
[02:17:44] Special group, Vietnam, North Vietnamese group of anti-American fighters.
[02:17:51] Train specifically, right?
[02:17:54] Right?
[02:17:55] I got that right.
[02:17:56] Did I remember that correctly?
[02:17:57] Yeah, that's the definition that John Stryker Meyer just gave you.
[02:18:02] Yeah.
[02:18:03] All right.
[02:18:05] Cool.
[02:18:06] What else?
[02:18:07] Well, I would say, no, awesome.
[02:18:11] Awesome to have John Stryker Meyer on here.
[02:18:15] And just to hear him talk about what human beings can do.
[02:18:24] Right?
[02:18:25] What people, human beings, can do.
[02:18:28] And it's interesting, because you ever look at dogs and you think, oh, there's a little
[02:18:31] tiny chihuahua.
[02:18:32] And then there's like a German Shepherd.
[02:18:35] Yeah.
[02:18:36] And you think those are the same animal?
[02:18:38] Right?
[02:18:39] Yes.
[02:18:40] They are.
[02:18:41] Technically.
[02:18:42] Yeah.
[02:18:43] Human beings.
[02:18:44] Think, you know.
[02:18:45] Like you look at John Stryker Meyer.
[02:18:47] He's like a German Shepherd.
[02:18:49] Yeah.
[02:18:50] And then you got people running around their chihuahua.
[02:18:52] No, it depends against the chihuahua, but your chihuahua is not going to...
[02:18:55] Yes.
[02:18:56] Fend off hordes.
[02:18:57] No.
[02:18:58] No.
[02:18:59] Chihuahua is not calling an Airstrikes danger close.
[02:19:01] No.
[02:19:02] I guess my point is that human beings do have capabilities.
[02:19:06] And I think that when you listen to tilt, you realize that I can probably do better.
[02:19:15] I know that's what I realize.
[02:19:17] I think I can do better than I'm doing right now.
[02:19:20] Yeah.
[02:19:21] I think I can push the envelope a little bit.
[02:19:24] Yeah.
[02:19:27] Move further toward the potential.
[02:19:31] The part that kind of, well, probably will stick with me is how he didn't carry
[02:19:38] Panture, like the sleepings, no comps.
[02:19:40] No comps.
[02:19:41] No comps.
[02:19:42] If we have to go sleep, I'm just going to sleep right here in the kitchen.
[02:19:45] Yeah.
[02:19:46] In the kitchen.
[02:19:47] On the aunt hill.
[02:19:48] Yeah.
[02:19:49] That part.
[02:19:51] When I was a kid, I was a kid.
[02:19:56] But now you need comfort.
[02:19:59] Yeah.
[02:20:01] So that part, maybe I have to mentally, maybe work on that.
[02:20:05] All right.
[02:20:06] It's facing it.
[02:20:07] There are ways to get better.
[02:20:09] Yes or there is.
[02:20:10] Maybe sleeping without a ground pad is one of them.
[02:20:13] Yeah.
[02:20:14] Maybe another one is train, Gigiatu.
[02:20:16] Oh yeah.
[02:20:17] Big time.
[02:20:18] That's a, I mean, so I was training the other day with Noah Oliver, right?
[02:20:23] And Noah's been training and he's kind of sorting out, you know how you go in phases of training partners.
[02:20:28] You know how you go.
[02:20:29] But I've been training with Andy for like the last like three months, you know, more than it.
[02:20:33] So man, but he's been like beat me down the other day yesterday.
[02:20:38] Yes or whatever.
[02:20:39] And yeah, he beat me down.
[02:20:42] But at the same time, I didn't leave thinking like, oh my gosh, you're just socks.
[02:20:48] You know, when you get beat down, you think of, okay, what do I need to do to that's the correct data?
[02:20:53] Yeah.
[02:20:54] Well, especially when you have training partners that you like and you trust and you, you know, you
[02:20:58] enjoy what you get from the training where every garnish you got beat down or not.
[02:21:02] I think your mind ought to, well, start automatically go to that.
[02:21:05] I think most of the time it's usually when, I don't know, it's other circumstances then you'll be all salty.
[02:21:11] Make excuses or something like that.
[02:21:13] Either way, so I'm thinking, you know, of all the things and then I arrive at the concept of man,
[02:21:19] in any other situation, you take that kind of like just physical turmoil.
[02:21:25] That only did get beat, but it was that kind of heart, you know.
[02:21:30] Usually I don't feel this good about it.
[02:21:33] I'm not looking forward to the next time, you know, like, come on, let's face it.
[02:21:36] You do a hard and met con, you're like boom, I'm glad that's over with it.
[02:21:39] But in this case, you are looking forward to the next one.
[02:21:41] Yeah, you're looking forward to the next one, you're looking forward to just training more in general.
[02:21:46] There's a short term and long term pay off for this.
[02:21:50] Judzitsuit thing.
[02:21:51] Interesting.
[02:21:52] Oh yeah.
[02:21:53] Very true.
[02:21:54] I've got to mention the capability that you wind up with.
[02:21:57] So we're pro-Juget series, what we're dedicated to.
[02:21:59] We are 100,000 percent short term and long term.
[02:22:02] There's no, there's no dichotomy.
[02:22:04] There's just short term gain, long term gain.
[02:22:06] Yes, in my opinion.
[02:22:08] But it could be argued that, oh, it's hard.
[02:22:11] What about the days?
[02:22:12] What about sometimes when people don't want to train?
[02:22:14] They let the jigset to window close.
[02:22:16] Like, we confirmed is a thing.
[02:22:18] It is a thing, but that's, you know what I kind of arrived at as well.
[02:22:21] The days that you actually don't want to train are way more rare than you might think.
[02:22:26] Like, if you ever said, man, I really don't feel like training.
[02:22:29] And then you make the drive to the gym, you get to the gym, you train in part and you show up.
[02:22:33] You write when you go to shake hands and you still feel like,
[02:22:36] Oh, I really don't want to train in our business.
[02:22:38] Do you have those?
[02:22:39] Never have.
[02:22:40] Never, right?
[02:22:41] Hardly ever.
[02:22:42] I can't think of one single time.
[02:22:43] I thought I came to the gym one time and I got there.
[02:22:46] And I was like, I still don't want to train, but it was because there was only like,
[02:22:50] three people there and they were like really brand new at the time.
[02:22:53] And then I was like, and I just went home one time and my whole life.
[02:22:57] But I did, I legitimately did not feel like training anyway.
[02:23:01] Legitement.
[02:23:02] Usually, if you don't feel like training, it's not that you don't feel like training.
[02:23:06] It's not that you don't feel like training.
[02:23:10] It's, you don't feel like getting off the couch, getting into your car, getting your gear, getting,
[02:23:17] doing that.
[02:23:20] That's what you don't feel like doing.
[02:23:21] Oh, you feel like training because when it's time to train, it's good fun.
[02:23:24] Every single time.
[02:23:25] That's what I think.
[02:23:26] It's a weird aspect that GG2 is fun.
[02:23:29] It's fun.
[02:23:30] Yeah.
[02:23:31] I have a feeling sometimes when I train GG2 where I'm literally like kind of beside myself with how
[02:23:38] fun that just.
[02:23:39] Oh, yeah.
[02:23:40] Yeah.
[02:23:41] And that's sometimes I'm getting beat down and I'm thinking that sometimes I'm winning
[02:23:45] something.
[02:23:46] But either way, I'm like, that was it's kind of like a feeling that's very hard to to describe.
[02:23:55] Even.
[02:23:56] Yeah.
[02:23:57] I would agree with that.
[02:23:58] Yeah.
[02:23:59] Because you have that obviously the physical part of it.
[02:24:01] Right.
[02:24:02] Yeah.
[02:24:03] Yeah.
[02:24:04] That's always good.
[02:24:05] You know that.
[02:24:06] But this is like, it's like, especially if you roll with like guys who are like, good.
[02:24:09] They're not good because they're so athletic, even though they might be athletic.
[02:24:13] They're good because they know what to do.
[02:24:14] Like a Dean, Mr. like Greg McIntyre.
[02:24:16] These guys who like Greg.
[02:24:17] Greg, Greg.
[02:24:18] Greg, Greg, if you don't think you're way into or out of your situation you want, man, you're
[02:24:25] you're just not going to do it.
[02:24:26] You know, so it's that problem solving task that's just intertwined in the whole thing.
[02:24:32] I think that's what makes it fun.
[02:24:33] That's what I think.
[02:24:34] Agreed.
[02:24:35] Anyway, GG, no GG streets, whatever.
[02:24:39] If you want to do GG, you're going to need a GG.
[02:24:42] You get a GG from origin, origin made up of us.
[02:24:46] We can get the GG very selections on there.
[02:24:49] The best.
[02:24:50] Made in America, by the way.
[02:24:51] Made in America.
[02:24:52] Yeah.
[02:24:52] And just kind of massive shipment of cotton.
[02:24:56] I'm talking not talking woven.
[02:24:58] I'm talking unwoven little strands of cotton.
[02:25:01] Check out the Instagram.
[02:25:04] There's palettes and palettes that are there.
[02:25:07] And it's just, you think, okay, this cotton is going to get woven.
[02:25:11] And then turned into geese that I'm going to wear.
[02:25:14] What does cotton look like when it comes to palettes?
[02:25:16] Because we want to use this little spools of, and it's not even, it's not just cotton,
[02:25:21] by the way, it's a blended material.
[02:25:23] So it's like, modern.
[02:25:24] Yeah.
[02:25:25] It's like a spool, but it's thick, a little bit thicker.
[02:25:28] Good.
[02:25:29] And that all gets woven together.
[02:25:30] We used to grow cotton when I was young.
[02:25:32] And the yard.
[02:25:33] I'm quite.
[02:25:34] Really.
[02:25:35] For what purpose?
[02:25:36] Just, that's just how I guess.
[02:25:38] I don't know.
[02:25:39] Did you do something with?
[02:25:41] I don't know.
[02:25:42] Random.
[02:25:43] It was a row of cotton trees.
[02:25:46] So cotton is like a, it's like almost like a pod that turns inside out like a popcorn almost.
[02:25:52] Yeah.
[02:25:53] If I remember correctly.
[02:25:54] And so that cotton would be balls of cotton.
[02:25:57] You know, like you get, you know, when you buy cotton balls?
[02:25:59] Yeah.
[02:26:00] Or, I'm sure you always buy cotton balls.
[02:26:02] But when you buy cotton balls, they're in balls.
[02:26:04] They're kind of like that, but more like there's not, they're not in a ball.
[02:26:07] They're in a big clump.
[02:26:08] Okay.
[02:26:09] But there's seeds all in there.
[02:26:10] You got to pick out the seeds and the seeds are all stuck to the cotton.
[02:26:13] I thought that's how they came.
[02:26:15] But they're, they're twined in order.
[02:26:17] Yes.
[02:26:18] Spongebob.
[02:26:19] Yeah.
[02:26:20] Into string.
[02:26:21] All right.
[02:26:22] So we got cotton.
[02:26:23] We got geese.
[02:26:24] We got jeans.
[02:26:25] Also.
[02:26:26] I got jeans.
[02:26:27] By the way.
[02:26:27] Oh, so you're in the game now.
[02:26:28] I am totally in the game.
[02:26:29] And I'm surprised how good, how good.
[02:26:31] Okay.
[02:26:32] Good.
[02:26:33] American denim.
[02:26:33] Sure.
[02:26:34] The buttons.
[02:26:35] Brass.
[02:26:36] When I see them, sure, I'm impressed.
[02:26:38] But I'm, maybe I'm more surprised on top of the impress of how they fit.
[02:26:43] Next level.
[02:26:44] I thought they were going to be like the kind of older, just generic feeding worker jeans.
[02:26:48] Which is fine.
[02:26:49] I get it.
[02:26:50] But that's not really what I was like deep down hoping for.
[02:26:54] I was hoping for the kind that, you know, I can put on.
[02:26:56] I can wear to, you know, if I go somewhere special with my life or something like that.
[02:27:00] Use putting on those origin jeans.
[02:27:02] No.
[02:27:03] You can't.
[02:27:04] Yes. They're very good. They fit good.
[02:27:06] Hand it to Pete.
[02:27:07] Yeah.
[02:27:08] That stylish fashion dude.
[02:27:09] They even fit a bit.
[02:27:11] They even fit skinny knees.
[02:27:14] All right.
[02:27:16] T-shirts.
[02:27:17] Jeans.
[02:27:17] Gies.
[02:27:18] Rascar's joggers.
[02:27:19] Supplements.
[02:27:21] Yes.
[02:27:22] Supplements.
[02:27:22] Get your joint warfare.
[02:27:24] Get your krill oil.
[02:27:27] Get your discipline.
[02:27:29] Get your discipline.
[02:27:30] Go.
[02:27:31] Get these things.
[02:27:32] They will.
[02:27:33] They will make your life better.
[02:27:36] That's crazy.
[02:27:37] That sounds.
[02:27:38] They will make your life better as will.
[02:27:41] Mulk.
[02:27:42] Yes.
[02:27:43] And some people say what is mulk.
[02:27:45] And the answer is very clear.
[02:27:47] Mulk is.
[02:27:48] Mulk is mulk.
[02:27:49] That's right.
[02:27:50] Mulk is mulk.
[02:27:51] You can't just call it something.
[02:27:52] You can't call.
[02:27:54] You can't call a knife by some other name.
[02:27:57] Right.
[02:27:58] Right.
[02:27:58] It's a knife.
[02:27:59] Yeah.
[02:28:00] So you can't call mulk.
[02:28:01] You can't say mulk is something else.
[02:28:04] No.
[02:28:05] Mulk is mulk.
[02:28:06] Then again I'm in heaven.
[02:28:07] Don't fall that.
[02:28:08] You can't call the knife a chunk.
[02:28:10] Okay.
[02:28:11] A blade.
[02:28:12] Yeah.
[02:28:13] You're right.
[02:28:14] Cold steel.
[02:28:15] There's a lot of words for a knife.
[02:28:17] So there's other words for mulk.
[02:28:18] That is where you're saying.
[02:28:19] No.
[02:28:20] I'm not saying that.
[02:28:21] Just say mulk is mulk.
[02:28:22] Yes.
[02:28:23] It is a dessert in the shape of a protein powder.
[02:28:27] That's healthy.
[02:28:28] Okay.
[02:28:29] So you can either call that or you can call a mulk.
[02:28:32] It tastes like dessert.
[02:28:33] And yet it's good for you and gives you protein.
[02:28:36] Strawberry is delicious.
[02:28:38] Mint chocolate chip.
[02:28:39] I had so much strawberry.
[02:28:42] I had to go back to mint and I was like,
[02:28:44] Good.
[02:28:45] It's crazy.
[02:28:46] Mint is delicious.
[02:28:47] What do you want?
[02:28:49] Mint chocolate chip ice cream milkshake or do you want to mint mulk?
[02:28:51] Oh, I'll take the mint mulk all day long.
[02:28:53] Oh yeah.
[02:28:54] Short and long term bail.
[02:28:55] Short and long term bail off.
[02:28:56] Peanut butter, Reese's cup.
[02:28:58] I don't know if you're allowed to say Reese's cup,
[02:29:00] but that's basically what you're saying.
[02:29:02] Peanut butter Reese's cup, but it's peanut butter
[02:29:04] and chocolate mulk tasty.
[02:29:07] What am I missing?
[02:29:08] Vanilla.
[02:29:09] I'm not a vanilla guy.
[02:29:10] I don't like the vanilla yogurt.
[02:29:12] I don't like vanilla.
[02:29:13] Vanilla.
[02:29:14] Vanilla mulk is.
[02:29:15] It's if you like vanilla, you're good.
[02:29:17] Right.
[02:29:18] If you don't like vanilla, you don't don't get it.
[02:29:20] There's a whole hoard of vanilla like this.
[02:29:23] Yeah, for sure.
[02:29:24] But the thing that's cool about vanilla,
[02:29:25] I guess is that you can do other things with it.
[02:29:27] Yeah.
[02:29:28] Jason Gardner put it in your morning coffee.
[02:29:30] Head it with the, he likes to say,
[02:29:32] hit it with the blender stick.
[02:29:35] Right?
[02:29:36] You know, people some people like to say things.
[02:29:38] Yes, they do.
[02:29:39] He's like, I hate it.
[02:29:40] He gets all fired up through.
[02:29:41] I hate it with that blender stick.
[02:29:43] He calls it a blender stick.
[02:29:45] So they're Jason Gardner.
[02:29:47] So in Jason Gardner's,
[02:29:50] he's a great shape getting after it.
[02:29:54] So maybe it maybe is a positive thing.
[02:29:57] And no forget that there's a warrior kid moke.
[02:30:00] Because do you want to feed your child poison?
[02:30:04] No.
[02:30:05] Do you?
[02:30:06] I do not.
[02:30:07] Okay.
[02:30:08] Cool.
[02:30:09] Then you get a moke.
[02:30:10] Do you want your kid to be miserable when they eat
[02:30:12] because what you're feeding them tastes disgusting?
[02:30:14] Let me think.
[02:30:15] No.
[02:30:16] Okay.
[02:30:17] Cool.
[02:30:18] So you give a moke.
[02:30:19] And you're being healthy.
[02:30:20] And you're taking care of your kid.
[02:30:21] And you're actually being a good parent.
[02:30:22] Oh yeah.
[02:30:23] Otherwise you're neglecting your child's welfare.
[02:30:26] Don't do it.
[02:30:27] Yeah.
[02:30:28] Moke, strawberry moke, chocolate moke gets on.
[02:30:31] Let's true.
[02:30:32] My daughter's in this phase.
[02:30:33] Hopefully short where she's comparing her body
[02:30:36] with other people's body.
[02:30:38] Oh yeah.
[02:30:39] That'll be a short phase.
[02:30:40] It only lasts like 500 years.
[02:30:42] So man, it kind of makes you think like,
[02:30:46] Oh shoot.
[02:30:47] She's paying attention now.
[02:30:48] She's going to get in your gut.
[02:30:49] And it's going to.
[02:30:50] Oh yeah.
[02:30:51] Whatever.
[02:30:52] Anyway.
[02:30:53] So.
[02:30:54] What is your when they're going to do curls?
[02:30:57] Yeah.
[02:30:58] Pushups.
[02:30:59] Actually she does burp.
[02:31:00] You know what I tell her?
[02:31:01] It's kind of a trick.
[02:31:02] I don't know.
[02:31:03] Tell me if you think this is a lie.
[02:31:04] So she'll be like, hey, I don't really feel like doing the workout today.
[02:31:08] So I say, okay, you don't have to do the workout.
[02:31:12] If.
[02:31:13] And only if you do burpees and pushups.
[02:31:16] Kind of like burpees and pushups are not the workout.
[02:31:19] Even though that is the workout.
[02:31:20] Oh yeah.
[02:31:21] It's like 70 burpees and like 40 pushups or something like that.
[02:31:26] That's the whole workout.
[02:31:27] I'm going to make a six year old do a full on met Connor and nothing like that.
[02:31:30] But I say, you don't have to do the workout.
[02:31:32] You only have to do the pushups.
[02:31:33] The burps.
[02:31:34] She's like, okay.
[02:31:35] You know, kind of like she has to work out even though that is where is that lying?
[02:31:38] That's flanking, right?
[02:31:39] Yeah.
[02:31:40] It's a flake.
[02:31:41] Hell yeah.
[02:31:42] And the last step.
[02:31:43] You're good.
[02:31:44] I'd say.
[02:31:45] Yeah.
[02:31:46] I mean, you know, when when you know, she's still a girl.
[02:31:49] She's just a power body looks in all this stuff and being a sex man.
[02:31:53] And I kind of feel this overwhelming responsibility.
[02:31:57] Like, hey, if she starts like putting on weight that she doesn't like or something like that,
[02:32:02] it's kind of my fault.
[02:32:03] You know, at this point it is.
[02:32:05] For sure.
[02:32:06] So the more you can feel real good about it, especially that she likes it.
[02:32:10] You know, and that's job very one is, I don't know how they did that.
[02:32:14] But keep doing it.
[02:32:15] That's what I know.
[02:32:16] Anyway, also, juggle white tea.
[02:32:18] Yes.
[02:32:19] Can you get addicted to juggle white tea?
[02:32:22] The answer is yes.
[02:32:24] Yes.
[02:32:25] It's psychological.
[02:32:26] J.P. to know.
[02:32:27] J.P. to know is my brother.
[02:32:30] Currently addicted to juggle white tea.
[02:32:32] I'm talking about him.
[02:32:33] I'm saying the boys got a little bit of an addiction problem with juggle white tea.
[02:32:36] All right.
[02:32:37] Well, there you go.
[02:32:38] And I mean, I'm sure I haven't thought about that much, but I'm sure there is some drawbacks.
[02:32:42] Being addicted to juggle white tea.
[02:32:43] I don't know.
[02:32:44] But from here, I mean, the intuitive thought is that man.
[02:32:47] That's all upside addicted to good stuff.
[02:32:50] Yeah.
[02:32:51] You know, it's like, I am addicted to juggle white tea.
[02:32:52] And I have an 8,000 pound dead left.
[02:32:53] How's it going?
[02:32:54] Yeah.
[02:32:55] Probably way more now.
[02:32:56] Yeah.
[02:32:56] Probably like 1200 or something.
[02:32:58] Sure.
[02:32:59] Anyway, you're juggle white tea is available.
[02:33:01] Kansas well, tea bags as well.
[02:33:04] On the stores and the stores on Amazon everywhere.
[02:33:07] Mm-hmm.
[02:33:08] Get it.
[02:33:09] But it's out there.
[02:33:10] Yeah.
[02:33:10] For sure.
[02:33:11] Get your addiction on something good.
[02:33:12] Also, we have our own store speaking of the stores called juggle store.
[02:33:15] This is where you can get this clinical stream of shirts.
[02:33:18] Like I said, juggle white tea is on the store.
[02:33:20] It's on the store.
[02:33:22] Tins refills all that stuff.
[02:33:24] Hoodies, lightweight, and heavyweight hats.
[02:33:26] Rashcards.
[02:33:27] Rashcards.
[02:33:28] Rashcards.
[02:33:29] A big time.
[02:33:30] Yeah.
[02:33:31] Oh, yeah.
[02:33:32] If you want to represent the path while you're on the spot.
[02:33:33] And a rashcard today when I was doing a ring workout.
[02:33:36] Go on.
[02:33:37] Ring.
[02:33:38] So I was using the rings.
[02:33:39] And if you don't wear a rashcard when you're doing rings, if you do high reps,
[02:33:42] you'll start to shave your arms a bunch.
[02:33:44] Which is no big deal.
[02:33:45] But then you get like, you know, you're if you're doing jiu-jitsu, then you're starting to get a little
[02:33:49] infection exposures going on.
[02:33:51] So just wear a rashcard.
[02:33:52] Yeah.
[02:33:53] Also, you know, if you work at the bank or somewhere where people sort of have to have at least a little bit of trust in you.
[02:34:01] If you're rolling around with shaved hands and arms and stuff, they're like, oh, proud.
[02:34:04] What's up with this guy, you know?
[02:34:05] They don't know that you're doing a rashcard.
[02:34:06] I actually just feel like that more.
[02:34:07] Well, yeah, you, but you're like, you're like one, two levels like beyond.
[02:34:11] You know, like in fight club.
[02:34:12] When, you know, well, this movie fight club where like, no, I've said that movie.
[02:34:15] Yeah, you know, when he's at the restaurant, he sees that the two black eyes are broken nose and he trusts some more.
[02:34:20] He's like, he gives him the nod, but an on-pours sense.
[02:34:22] Like, probably this guy with two black eyes broken nose, shaved arms, all this stuff.
[02:34:26] Who is this guy?
[02:34:27] Is a weirdo.
[02:34:28] He's doing weirdo stuff.
[02:34:29] He's doing deviant stuff.
[02:34:30] That's for sure.
[02:34:31] So you don't want that.
[02:34:32] You don't want that on the surface is what I'm saying.
[02:34:35] Even though you like it.
[02:34:37] So basically what you're saying is get a get a rashcard from the jockel store.
[02:34:41] So you're not weird to other people.
[02:34:43] That's what I just heard.

[02:38:18] Oh, the park where we're.
[02:38:19] Yeah.
[02:38:20] You know what's fun is, like you're just totally putting yourself
[02:38:23] on report about all the videos.

[02:39:10] If they may arise.
[02:39:12] I went to a, I didn't go to the donut shop.
[02:39:15] I passed it.
[02:39:16] There's a bank and there's a donut shop right by where it is.
[02:39:19] Isn't it weird that donut shops exist?
[02:39:21] Oh, they don't anymore. That was going to be my point.
[02:39:24] Zero people in there.
[02:39:25] The lady in there.
[02:39:26] So we're winning.
[02:39:27] You know what?

[02:39:34] I don't know.
[02:39:35] Record rate or something like this.
[02:39:37] But man, the lady in the donut shop was on her laptop in one of the
[02:39:43] customer like tables on the seat.

[02:39:49] Yeah.
[02:39:50] I was like, dang.
[02:39:51] Anyway, what should they replace all donut shops with?
[02:39:54] Stake houses.
[02:39:56] Yeah.
[02:39:57] Well, yeah.
[02:39:58] I guess there's lots of houses.
[02:40:00] Do you have this?
[02:40:01] Do you have two?
[02:40:02] Yeah.
[02:40:03] Just like a vacant, you know what they should do.
[02:40:06] A vacant building.
[02:40:07] They clear out all the donut material and machines.
[02:40:11] I don't know how you make donuts.
[02:40:13] But clear out all that stuff.
[02:40:14] And you just put one like mat space.

[02:40:31] Album tracks about Jocco, can you through your moments?
[02:40:33] So what I've, what the report says that that psychological warfare, the album has
[02:40:39] done massive damage to the donut industry apparently is what's going on.

[02:43:39] Fear.
[02:43:40] So check those out.
[02:43:41] Then we've got the discipline.
[02:43:42] It goes for you to them.
[02:43:43] Field manual.
[02:43:45] Which will tell you how to get after it.
[02:43:47] You don't need to ask.
[02:43:49] You can just get them manual.
[02:43:51] Wouldn't that be nice?
[02:43:52] Yeah.
[02:43:53] Oh, it's true.
[02:43:54] It is nice.
[02:43:55] Yes.
[02:43:56] You get that field manual and you're good to go.
[02:43:57] If you want the audio version that it's on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google play and other MP3 platforms.
[02:44:04] And then, of course, you got extreme ownership.
[02:44:06] And then I caught a meal of leadership, the two books that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin,
[02:44:11] talking about everything that we've learned in combat and how you can take those lessons.
[02:44:16] And you can utilize them with your business, with your team, with your life.
[02:44:23] So check those out.
[02:44:24] Also, we got echelon front.
[02:44:25] That's my leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems through leadership.
[02:44:32] If you problem that exists in your organization, it's a leadership problem.
[02:44:37] So if you need help fixing that leadership problem and thereby fixing the problems that you have inside your organization,
[02:44:43] go to echelon front.com.
[02:44:47] If you need further instruction, if you want something beyond this podcast, if you want to come to the
[02:44:56] Master, the Master is a leadership training seminar, I guess.
[02:45:03] I'd call it.
[02:45:04] It's a leadership convention.
[02:45:06] And what we do is go deep dive, get granular on leadership.
[02:45:12] The next one is September 19th and 20th in Denver.
[02:45:15] And then after that, it's December 4th and 5th in Sydney, Australia.
[02:45:19] Every single, we've done seven.
[02:45:21] They've also told out these are going to sell out too.
[02:45:23] So if you want to come, go to treemonership.com and sign up.
[02:45:26] And if you can't come to that, you can go to efonline.com.
[02:45:31] And that's our leadership training interactive online platform where you can get the skills.
[02:45:41] You can reinforce the skills.
[02:45:44] The skills that I talk about on this podcast, the skills that we wrote about in the books,
[02:45:48] those skills need further training all the time.
[02:45:53] Never master these things.
[02:45:54] So go to efonline.com and check that out.
[02:45:56] And then there's, of course, a geof Overwatch where we've been taking proven leaders, tested
[02:46:03] leaders from special operations and from combat aviation and putting them into companies
[02:46:09] in the civilian sector that need leadership.
[02:46:13] So if you're looking to hire, don't always hire just because someone has experience.
[02:46:17] Higher, four character, higher, four leadership capability.
[02:46:22] And then you teach them the industry specifics because that's easier than trying to teach someone
[02:46:27] character or trying to teach someone leadership.
[02:46:29] You have full Overwatch.com if you need leadership.
[02:46:33] And if you want to converse with us further, then we are on the interwebs, on Twitter, on Instagram,
[02:46:44] and on that shhh, face you blush.

[02:46:59] And once again, thanks to John Striker, Meyer.

[02:47:38] And we thank you for it. And to everyone else out there, you might be scared and you might be tired.
[02:47:48] And you might be surrounded by the enemy who is preparing to attack, but you know what?
[02:47:56] You're still alive.
[02:48:00] So get the high ground, set up your perimeter, lock and load your weapons, and go get after it.
[02:48:07] And until next time, this is echo and jocco out.
