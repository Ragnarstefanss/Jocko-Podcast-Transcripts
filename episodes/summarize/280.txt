yeah daresor was one of the main gosh what do you even call a place like that you want to call it a death camp but that sort of makes you think of the Nazi example where this is like a factory of death and it wasn't it wasn't that you had these these caravans that were being wound through the desert to be robbed and raped and killed and enslaved as they went and just eyewitness report after eyewitness report describes the road on the way down is just littered with corpses and body parts everywhere you go anytime there's a hill you look over the other side of it off the road and it's just filled with bodies back there the rivers are choked with bodies and body parts but some of the people survived some of the people just figured it out you just said people who were alive started to eat the flesh of the dead people who haven't had anything to eat for a month will do you lose your mind when you start to when you start to starve and die of thirst and exposure and some people made it and for those who made it tell was waiting for them you know at the place that they got to at the end of the line one of them called their Zor is basically big open air cages that they just pen people up in and there was no food and there was no water and there was no medicine and they just stayed in there and they died and now you know this wasn't Auschwitz with you know double razor wire fences you know multiple layers deep people could kind of get there and you know if you had an ability to do if you knew somebody who maybe came down there to give you a blanket or some food you might live a little bit longer than everybody else but people were dying by the 500 the thousands the 2000s a day just dying of disease and exposure and hunger and thirst and periodically massacre sometimes when another caravan would get there and they're just simply wasn't any room for anyone else they would either take that caravan or most often they would take people who were already degraded near the point of death and they would be like well we're moving you to the next location you're going south again everybody back on the road and there was nothing south they just marched them out there people who were already right on the point of death they would march them further into the Syrian desert they would just wander out there and die or be massacred the scenes in derseor that are described or really something beyond I mean it's a heronum is Bosch painting you know this is from the book no pen can possibly convey the suffering and misery of these exile Armenians persecuted wanders surrounded by savage gangs of police soldiers riding in thousands of wagons and carts and on beasts of burden though most were on foot and many of those bear like dried leaves driven by the wind they passed through this sold bloody passage and on to the arid deserts of derseor to die without bread without water without a shroud and without a grave barely had the men from these regions been separated from the women and put on the road to exile when they were mercifully slaughtered and their corpses thrown into the rivers or valleys as food for vultures and other wild animals the young brides and virgins were yanked from the embrace of their crying mothers and taken to Turkish herems even ten year old girls were subjected to all manner of savage unbearable debotuary the older women who managed to endure the terrible hardships of the road were taken to derseor where they were brutally slaughtered during the summer of 1916 here we encounter two young Armenian engineers who had been in charge with overseeing the work of an Armenian labor battalion in tears they told me how in 1915 particularly in September and October approximately 80,000 Armenians of both sexes were encamped under tents made from bedsheets and rags on the plain near the valley stretching all the way to the spacious swampy field by the Mamure Railway Station 600 to 700 were dying daily from hunger thirst and fever when suddenly a lengthy nocturnal autumn rain came and finished the task left unfinished by the human beasts the people were stuck in the standing pools of water for several days severe cold insert ensued and none of them had adequate shelter clothing or food they froze to death by the thousands falling like the autumn leaves or they died from dysentery diarrhea bleeding and other plagues of overcrowding the field was soon covered with mounds of unbearied bodies under makeshift tents and entire families were reduced to corpses by hunger and cold with no one to bury them nor could those Armenians who found their dead kinfolk find any spades or hose to bury them with and behold suddenly one morning to bring this widespread and heart-trending wretchedness to its ultimate perfection the director of the exiled caravans and hundreds of police soldiers bearing whips and clubs surrounded the poor people already at death store and ordered them to get immediately on the road it isn't humanly possible to imagine the hue and cry the begging and pleading and the chaos that prevailed in and around those thousands of tents the tents were then taken down and the portable goods and bundles representing the deportees last bits of property were assembled but they had neither carts nor wagons nor beasts of burden to carry them the lamentation then began many would not leave loved ones who were sick in their death throws lying on the ground uncaired for and abandoned the dying agast beg not to be abandoned in the open fields as food for hungry wolves and corpse eating hyenas that prowled the night but they had no time to think the military police and major and minor officials fell upon them without pity or human feeling they struck the hapless and confused left and right hitting them everywhere eyes burst open skulls were crushed faces were covered with blood and new wounds were opened up nobody cared nobody took pity on them the survivors seeing that they had no option but to leave took down and folded thousands of tents and in an instant throwing them over their shoulders got on the road leaving their ill and dying loved ones behind the wretched Armenian mothers who unable to take their underage children two to six years old children who had fallen ill from starvation extreme cold and the hardship of the long road half dead or in the throws of death had to leave them on top of the already dead tearfully the eyewitnesses told us how two large mounds of corpses of thousands of Armenian children rose up among them numerous children who had not yet died and who extended their small hands searching for their mothers the eyes of these omaciated and neglected angels bore a look of pleading and protest directed toward their mothers and toward God and from their half dead lips some of them cried that sacred word mommy for the last time since their mothers could not possibly take the children along in a few hours the little ones would be dead and would have to be left on the road but you're talking tens of thousands at least of our menian women and children taking away this way you know maybe a hundred maybe over a hundred thousand the total number of deaths between one one point five million but the number of people who were taken away is slaves and just kind of melted into the population or were murdered later that's what happened to a lot of these people it was it was in the ten at least the tens of thousands you know sex slavery in the Ottoman Empire that this isn't something that just sort of came out of nowhere because of the chaos it was going on there was actually just last night as I was brushing up on some of this I came across in New York times article written in 1886 by a journalist who managed to he had a he had a guide there in Constantinople that was helping them and they dressed him up in a beard and said he looked like you know he was from the area and he had some money and they got him into some of these places where they were selling women and this was in 1886 none of this was going on and they would they were mostly so there's always Christian women usually you're not you can't enslaved Muslims sometimes you know people do what they do but generally speaking that's what happened and so it would be Circassians and Slavs and Armenians and sometimes a series of Greeks and so this was something that you know that the Sultan himself the way the Sultan reproduced was he had a harem of hundreds and hundreds of women and all of them were slaves taken from Christian lands and they would be kept in a cell in like a very specific part of the palace and they would be guarded by black like black African unix and so I mean just again give you some idea of like the society we're talking about here the king has hundreds of slave women kept in cells and like his own palace they're not allowed to interact with anybody else and they're guarded with they're guarded by unix who were castrated specifically for the purpose I mean this is a it's a different we're not talking about you know the abundance dog or the English parliament or something it's just a different different time in a different place I mean we do after remember that you know we're I just mentioned that New York Times article in 1886 it only 21 years before was when we got rid of you know Chatelle slavery in the United States so it was a different time and there were a lot of things going on back then but there's a there's a little bit of exotic strangeness to something like that that I think kind of shocks us a little bit and this idea that you know you could take especially non-Islamic women as spoils of war and a sex slavery we saw that reignite when ISIS you know rampaged through everywhere they were taken to Yazidis and everybody else that they found it wasn't Muslim as sex slaves and it was horrifying to us 15 gen darm's going with us the party numbered four five hundred persons we had got only two hours away from home when bands of villagers in large numbers with rifles guns axes etc surrounded us on the road and robbers of all we had the jondarms took my three horses and sold them to local Muslims pocketing the money they took my money and that from my daughter's neck also all our food after this they separated the man one by one and shop them all within six or seven days every mail above 15 years old by my side we're killed two priests one of them over 90 years of age these bandsmen took all the good looking women and carried them off on their horses very many women and girls with us carried off into the mountains among them my sister whose one year old baby they threw away a turk picked it up and carried it off I know not where my mother walked till she could walk no further and dropped by the roads I don't a mountain top we found on the road many of those who had been in previous sections carried from bayboard some women among them were killed and their husbands and sons we came across some old people little infants still alive but in a pitiful condition having shouted their voices away we were not allowed to sleep at night in the villages but lay down outside under cover of the night indescribable deeds were committed by the jondarms bandsmen and villagers many of us died from hunger and strokes others were left by the roadside two people to go on one morning we saw 50 to six see wagons with about 30 turkish widows whose huntsbidden had been killed in the war and these were going to Constantinople one of these women made a sign to one of the jondarms to kill a certain Armenian whom she pointed out the jondarms asked if she did not wish to kill him herself at which she said why not and drawing a revolver from her pocket shot and killed him each one of these turkish hanooms which is a turkish lady had five or six Armenian girls of ten or under with her boys the turk's never wish to take they killed all of whatever age the worst and most unimaginable horrors were reserved for us at the banks of the year fradies the mutilated bodies of women girls and little children made everybody shudder the bandsmen were doing all sorts of awful deeds to the women and girls that were with us whose cries went up to heaven at the fradies the bandsmen and jondarms threw into the river all the remaining children under 15 years old those that could swim were shot down as they struggled in the water after seven days we reached Erzingian not an Armenian was left alive there the turkish women took my daughter and me to the bath and their showed us many other women and girls that had accepted Islam between there and andrays the fields and hillside were dotted with swollen and black and corpses that filled and fouled the air with their stench on this road we met six women wearing the ferage and with children in their arms but when the jondarms lifted their veils they found that they were men in disguise so they shot them after thirty two days journey we reached Constantinople one of the things that would happen on the trail of tears on this road to death was you know by the time you got a week out of any of these cities where people were deported a lot of the american consulate people and other diplomats and missionaries who were there including by the way this is really worth mentioning that i've been brought up yet a lot of the people diplomats who have reported on this and broke back about it and have provided a lot of material we have today these are German diplomats austrian diplomats these are people who are allied to the Ottoman Empire in this war who were writing back about a lot of these things there's one memoir that was written about it by a guy named rafael denogales who was a venezuelin mercenary who was actually serving as a turkit as a mercenary officer as a major in the turkish military and he wrote a lot about it as well and one of the things that you hear over and over again is how by the time you're a week out of the city all these people are naked all their clothes have been taken so they're walking in july or august maybe in the Syrian desert 12 hours a day or more you know and you think maybe they would get some rest but more often than not the nighttime was the worst time because they would stop for the evening and as ever they didn't have tens most of the time those would all would have all been taken from them they didn't have any kind of shelter so they're just sitting out in the weather and if there was a village nearby or a tribe nearby or sometimes just the soldiers themselves this was their time to blow off a little bit of steam and so they would show up and they would just be walking through the encampments of all of these women and children and elderly people who who stopped and they would just take their pick for rape they would take slaves sometimes they would just torture people for entertainment their stories of pretty Armenian women being strip naked and forced to dance for turkish soldiers and when they weren't pleased with their performance they just doubted the encarricine and watched the veranda death for their entertainment there's story after story after story after story like this and not a bunch of people from one caravan we're talking from all over the country throughout the entire period of this going on there's something you know there's maybe you can get people to go put a bullet in somebody's head for their country you can maybe play play up that angle of it to get them to do something like that you've got a really in general level of extraordinary hatred I think to to get people to do some of the things that were being done here especially the regular people that doesn't go so much for the special organization you know I think I think maybe in one of the unraveling episodes we did I asked a question like if you had a bar in town in any city in America where everybody knew that's the bar where in there there's this room and there's a person in there and you can just do whatever you want to that's the gimmick at the bar like I might not go there you guys might not go there and really I mean there was a historian American historian not not Armenian but just a historian of the Ottoman Empire who said that if they had lost that battle then the word Armenia today would just be a curious historical footnote you know we'd probably still have Armenians obviously just like we had Jews for a long period of time when there was no such thing as Israel but that's what we would be talking about you know it didn't preserve Armenian independence at the time they tried you know one of the things that happened was in that brief period after they did put a stop to them Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan which are all right there clumped together none of them wanted to be part of the Soviet Union at the time and they didn't want to be part of the Ottoman Empire either so they formed a little alliance to try to defend themselves but as soon as things got a little bit tricky Georgia was pretty quick to be like you know what we're going to go with the Soviet Union and Azerbaijan was very quick to be like you know what what Muslims too and they kind of stabbed the Armenians in the back and attacked them from behind and so the Armenians then at that point had to cut a deal with the Soviet Union and so Armenia became a Soviet socialist republic as well and so out of the out of the frying pan into the fire there you know although I mean you know the thing is one of the things that did happen in Armenia obviously you know they were under the same Soviet tyranny is everybody else to some degree but they did understand the Soviets even. and maybe the things in our house right now the furniture in our house right now maybe uh we're things that we that we took from these people when we killed them and um that's how it went over and over and over and over again you know and the thing that always the thing that is just the most unbearable to me is imagining like just I've mentioned it a few times already but it's the it's always the thing I can't get out of my head about this is that these are all women children old people the men were gone already and just imagining like your mother or your wife or your sisters or your kids being marched along out to the desert but these people set up on you know not blown up by a predator drone as bad as that it is they are being hacked down with machetes and axes and as you saw like in one of the one I think the onker eggs and apple that you read in in massacres that would take hours and hours and hours you know it takes a long time some of these they're killing 6, 7, 8,000 people at a time in a ravine by hand and that takes time and so it's just screaming in the smell of feces and blood and people you know you have just body parts hacked up over here and over there there's just a big rape or G he was a member of the young Turks um he had broken with the triumph or a little bit uh over you know military reasons over the years but he was still part of these people and a lot of the young Turks and even the committee of Union and progress the core group that was really carrying all this out they were still there they were still in the government you know there was no real we had denotsification after the second World War and there was really not a whole lot of that going on some of the very very main people you know they fled they they fled the country and so this wasn't carried out but they were tried in absentia some of them were sentenced to death some of the main architects um but after a little while everybody realized that Turkey is going to be kind of strategically important now that we have this huge threat of the Soviet Union looming up here and so like it or not we're going to have to kind of find a way to like bring Turkey back into the fall the mean Turkey was in NATO by the 1950s and it was considered a strategic necessity to just kind of forget about all this you know you get all the way up to the 1980s and there was a um an American scholar named Susan Blair who found a bunch of the American consulate documents that people hadn't people didn't even know about these and it was the entire ravine I mean you come over this ridge and it's just this entire ravine hundreds of yards and it is just bodies and they're not dead of you know this this place was was witnessed by an American from somebody from the American consulate who wrote out and saw it afterwards these bodies are not people who died of starvation or thirst or exposure these are people who's are just one big mass of gashes and mutilation and hacked off limbs and women with their heads cut off who are laying there with their dresses thrown up over their head and their legs spread with their heads cut off I mean that this is the these are the scenes that you see over and over and over and over to the point where you know you read a book like the 30 year genocide about it where he really does take the time to get into each of the massacres and it becomes almost significantly nauseatingly boring in a way and it's just it's hard to imagine when you make it personal like that you know trying to imagine the helplessness that you would feel knowing that this had happened to people that you cared about or being one of those people it would just it's it's hard to imagine well we don't necessarily just have to imagine it we can listen to when I witness the widow I witnessed this is going back to the book this is transmitted by an American ambassador to the secretary state says this a week before anything was done to bayboard the villages all around had been emptied and their inhabitants had become victims of the John Darm's and margarine bands three days before the starting of the Armenians from bayboard after a week's prison imprisonment our bishop had been hanged with seven other notables after these hangings seven or eight other notables were killed in their own houses for refusing to go out of the city 70 or 80 other Armenians after being beaten in prison were taken to the woods and killed the Armenian population of bayboard was sent off in three batches I was among the third batch my husband died eight years ago leaving me and my eight year old daughter and my mother extensive possessions so that we could so that we were living in comfort since mobilization began the merch has come common don has been living in my house free of rent he told me not to go that by Philip Garevich about the Roman in genocide we was to inform you that tomorrow we killed with our families and he has a quote in there when he's talking about what genocide is and the two the society that's perpetrating it and he has this line that's always stuck with me says genocide after all is a sort of community building exercise and that stuck with me as I was reading all the material about the Armenian genocide in the way that it's specific way that it was handled one of the things that happened was these people who would be deported down south when I say that what I'm talking about is you know all the men would be killed and the women children and old people who were left would be put into a caravan they'd be sent down to march in the Syrian desert on a march that would take about two months and when they got to the end it was just there was a death camp there where they would anybody who survived two months with you know no food because it would all be taken from them right away you know if they couldn't scrounge bugs out of the desert or eat dead bodies or whatever they had to do they'd buy a starvation if they couldn't if you weren't a woman who could you know use your body or whatever to get a Turkish soldier to give you a drink of water or do whatever you had to do then you died on the way and the roads were littered with bodies and sometimes they would just massacre all of you along the way but the ones who got to the end would get to these death camps in the Syrian desert and these routes you know it doesn't take two months to walk directly in a straight line from one place to their end state and an end place in the Syrian desert they would go on these winding routes sometimes but you wouldn't know that I maybe this has changed a little bit now you wouldn't know that by going on like rotten tomatoes the first night or first day that that thing was released there were like 5,000 like one star terrible horrible worst movie ever reviews and like all of them had kind of broken English and like whatever else I mean you see that and then immediately afterwards literally like the next year there was another Armenian genocide movie that was put out it was sponsored by the Turkish government and it was just it's almost worth watching for just the the the madness of the propaganda I mean you really have to like imagine a movie about the Nazis and the Holocaust where all of the SS officers and Heinrich Kim learned everybody else are just portrayed it's like they're just really trying to help all these Jews but like the Jews they just they ran off out there into Poland and something happened to them okay what if you had that in a prison that would be a lively joint I mean that's what you had going on here you had these caravans of women children and old people being marched down into the desert very often by guards who were from the special organization guys who were convicted murderers and rapists who had been given complete in total license from their government to do whatever they want and now you stop at nighttime and your board you've been on the road for a week riding in the hot sun on your horse guarding these people and what are you how you're going to spend your evening and the way a lot of them spent it was just you know again you just it's one of those things that like reading a book about it or anything just you really can't do justice until you really try just close your eyes and try to put yourself in the position of these people in the position of a mother who's already watched two of her children die of exposure and then has her baby grab by a leg and thrown in a river and then she's gang raped and she's going to be gang raped again and again and again for the next two months as she walks you know this road or until she can't take it anymore and commit suicide basically that was the situation of hundreds of thousands of people being marched down into the desert like this and and it was done by a bunch of Armenians without any state support you know if you think about everybody looks looks like what the masad did the Israelis did after the second world war they hunted down a thousand fifteen hundred Nazi officers SS officers around the world and that's you know that's that's good for them but the Armenians you had a group people who were doing this completely independently without any state support this group of hardcore militants who hunted these people down all around the world and essentially took out the entire Ottoman government that was running this during during the period all the high ranking people there is one other thing I want to close with I kind of forgot about earlier because there is uh to on the whole question of turkish denialism um this is a quote from a letter written by the leader of the special organization a guy named behind the inch of care and this was a letter that was found fairly fairly recently last few decades um this is right near the beginning of it he said the committee of union in progress as the bearer of the nation's honor has decided to free the homeland from the inordinate ambitions of this accursed nation and to assume the responsibility for the blemish that will stain Ottoman history in this regard the committee which cannot forget the country's bitter and unhappiness and whose cup runeth over with unrelenting desire for revenge has decided to annihilate all Armenians living within Turkey not to allow a single one to remain and has given the government broad authority in this regard on the question of how this killing and massacring will be carried out the central government will give the necessary instructions to the provincial governors and army commanders all of the unionist regional representatives would concern themselves with following up on the matter in all of the places where they were found and would ensure that not a single Armenian would receive protection or assistance not a lot of room for doubt there evil with that echo Charles maybe we could do a little decompression old school decompression scenario that was a rough one say so it was an overcrowded place they had a lot of people but they only again had about 1200 train soldiers and they were the ones that went and got everybody organized they rang the bells of the church bells of yeravan to muster everybody and you had women and children running supply lines everywhere getting everything in place you had men digging defensive fortifications you had old men serving as like signal operators with flags and things up on you know up on towers everybody was participating here and the Turkish army pushed up within you know just about within visual range just over the horizon of the capital of Armenia and they got to a place there were three areas where they fought but the main one that you know people remember today there's a great big monument there and a great museum Armenian history museum called Sardara Bot and thankfully this French guy it's not a it's not a very well-known battle if you look in general histories they'll talk they'll all talk about it So these are people who have lived in urban environment, they know how to engage in long distance trade, they know how to deal in like financial alchemy, they know how to do all, they know banking, they know law, they're all literate at a time when like 1% of your own population is literate because that's what these people do and they don't have their own place to live obviously. He was sort of a cultural figure that I that point so he was kind of there as like a technically was some kind of a minister of this or that I can't remember but really was there as like a cultural figure and he was in Paris 1942, you know 1941 and he's writing letters to people trying to figure out like I keep hearing about all these things that are going on out and polling down the east like what's going on out in the east like I hear about bad things going on east. they know the deck at work you know people forget things people forget everything it doesn't matter what you did or how bad it was or how many people were affected they have this idea that if you just keep denying it keep calling everybody a liar keep just do whatever you got to do the give it a century all we have to do is survive you know if you if you look like this was something that was really prominent at the time right you read all the read the writings of Lenin for example and Trotsky and Stalin you know all the Bolsheviks
