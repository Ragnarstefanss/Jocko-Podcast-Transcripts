00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16 This is Jockel Podcast number 259 with me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:05.16 --> 00:00:09.60 The A1E's arrived just as the team started taking incoming mortar fire.
00:00:09.60 --> 00:00:16.08 Godwin quickly calculated the coordinates for the mortar's location and the information was passed on to Kavi
00:00:16.08 --> 00:00:18.04 who in turn related to the A1E's.
00:00:18.04 --> 00:00:21.28 A laconic whistling voice came back down the line.
00:00:21.28 --> 00:00:25.28 It's crispy critter time, so y'all keep your heads down.
00:00:25.28 --> 00:00:29.92 Within seconds the area in front of the team exploded into flame.
00:00:29.92 --> 00:00:35.36 The deadly napaam coating everything in its erupting path, flaming NVA soldiers ran briefly
00:00:35.36 --> 00:00:38.92 toward the team before falling to the ground and agonizing death throws.
00:00:38.92 --> 00:00:43.04 The hand grenades and ammunition they carried cooking off like firecrackers.
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:47.48 Unfortunately, the elephant grass was also set on fire.
00:00:47.48 --> 00:00:51.92 The napaam had definitely slowed the NVA advance, but it had not stopped it.
00:00:51.92 --> 00:00:59.36 Kavi reported that extraction chopper were five minutes out and the team needed to move fast.
00:00:59.36 --> 00:01:04.36 Two gunships from the 7th Air Cav roared over the LZ.
00:01:04.36 --> 00:01:09.84 Watkins put out two bright orange marker panels and the gunships confirmed they had the team
00:01:09.84 --> 00:01:10.84 in sight.
00:01:10.84 --> 00:01:14.92 As they looped back to make their first strafing run, the gunships reported that a large enemy
00:01:14.92 --> 00:01:20.48 force was moving toward the LZ and they were going to attempt to discourage it.
00:01:20.48 --> 00:01:26.40 As they made their run pouring M60 machine gun fire and rockets into the enemy, RT lion
00:01:26.40 --> 00:01:30.88 could see the air filled with green tracers, hating the helicopters.
00:01:30.88 --> 00:01:35.04 They were taking a vicious beating, but they hung in there and kept pouring fire down on
00:01:35.04 --> 00:01:36.04 the NVA.
00:01:36.04 --> 00:01:40.80 It was an incredible show of raw guts and determination.
00:01:40.80 --> 00:01:45.60 Kavi came on the radio to say the gunships had taken casualties and were leaking fuel, oil,
00:01:45.60 --> 00:01:49.72 hydraulic fluid and just about everything else, so they were being forced to head home.
00:01:49.72 --> 00:01:53.24 But the extraction slicks were on station.
00:01:53.24 --> 00:01:59.64 RT lion looked around and could see its salvation coming toward it on its nose.
00:01:59.64 --> 00:02:04.84 Although they were flying at a good clip, it appeared as if they were moving at an agonizingly
00:02:04.84 --> 00:02:06.40 slow speed.
00:02:06.40 --> 00:02:11.72 As with the gunships before them, they were taking a horrendous amount of fire.
00:02:11.72 --> 00:02:15.76 One chopper was hit badly and began losing fuel.
00:02:15.76 --> 00:02:20.08 After a brief confabbed the rescue package suddenly broke off its approach and headed back
00:02:20.08 --> 00:02:27.88 the way it had come, leaving nothing but smoke and RT lion's hopes for rescue behind.
00:02:27.88 --> 00:02:32.16 When Watkins asked Kavi what this meant in terms of time on the ground, all heartness
00:02:32.16 --> 00:02:37.52 could do was say that he'd contact the S3 and ask for a new set of extraction assets
00:02:37.52 --> 00:02:38.52 ASAP.
00:02:38.52 --> 00:02:42.92 In the meantime, he promised to get more tactical air support over the team and do all he could
00:02:42.92 --> 00:02:44.36 to keep them alive.
00:02:44.36 --> 00:02:49.84 While Watkins appreciated the sentiments, this did not do much to raise his spirits.
00:02:49.84 --> 00:02:54.24 In his heart of hearts, he felt the team's position was precarious and likely to get
00:02:54.24 --> 00:02:57.60 much worse and quickly.
00:02:57.60 --> 00:03:02.44 The NVA had literally thousands of men it could throw at the team while the team had
00:03:02.44 --> 00:03:07.48 only so much ammunition and not much by way of cover.
00:03:07.48 --> 00:03:11.40 What he told his team members however was that there was going to be a slight delay and
00:03:11.40 --> 00:03:15.44 reminded them to keep vigilant and be ready for an attack.
00:03:15.44 --> 00:03:19.80 What he didn't have the heart to tell them was it could be hours before another rescue
00:03:19.80 --> 00:03:22.04 attempt was made.
00:03:22.04 --> 00:03:24.68 Their stay at Oscar A was far from over.
00:03:24.68 --> 00:03:28.20 One of the bruise suddenly signaled that NVA troops were crawling toward the team through
00:03:28.20 --> 00:03:29.60 the elephant grass.
00:03:29.60 --> 00:03:34.72 The news was passed on to Kavi who responded that he had two A1E standing by one loaded
00:03:34.72 --> 00:03:37.000 with CBUs and the other with rockets.
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.08 Both aircraft had their deadly 20mm cannons locked and loaded.
00:03:41.08 --> 00:03:45.64 rockets told Kavi to bring in the CBUs fast as possible and delay it down as close to the
00:03:45.64 --> 00:03:47.84 team as they could get.
00:03:47.84 --> 00:03:52.80 In less than two minutes, the team saw an A1E appear in front of their position.
00:03:52.80 --> 00:03:55.76 It's 20mm cannons roaring away.
00:03:55.76 --> 00:04:00.16 It flew so low they could see the pilot turn his head to locate the team as he released
00:04:00.16 --> 00:04:02.04 his ordinance.
00:04:02.04 --> 00:04:06.76 Unfortunately some of the mini bombs exploded so close to RT Lyon that two bruise
00:04:06.76 --> 00:04:12.68 received light wounds.
00:04:12.68 --> 00:04:14.92 This was distressing but walk-ins consider it one of the acceptable prices a recontain paid
00:04:14.92 --> 00:04:19.44 to keep from being overrun by a superior force.
00:04:19.44 --> 00:04:24.48 As the A1E is departed a small group of NVA suddenly rose up out of the grass behind the
00:04:24.48 --> 00:04:28.92 team and charged them, AK-47's blazing on full automatic.
00:04:28.92 --> 00:04:34.08 DeSetta, his red communist star facing forward rose up and opened fire at near point
00:04:34.08 --> 00:04:35.08 blank range.
00:04:35.08 --> 00:04:39.04 The broo joined in as other groups of NVA popped up from the elephant grass and attempted
00:04:39.04 --> 00:04:41.88 assault after assault.
00:04:41.88 --> 00:04:46.32 What followed was several hours of deadly cat and mouse with the mouse hunkered down and
00:04:46.32 --> 00:04:51.80 it's a little hole and the NVA cat making poss-wipe after poss-wipe in attempt to claw
00:04:51.80 --> 00:04:54.76 it out or do it in.
00:04:54.76 --> 00:04:59.36 And ironic situation for the team to find itself in.
00:04:59.36 --> 00:05:04.60 While RT Lyon fended off attacks, Kavi directed air strike after air strike at the NVA
00:05:04.60 --> 00:05:09.40 troops, the storage area, the anti-aircraft guns and anything else he could draw a bead
00:05:09.40 --> 00:05:11.28 on.
00:05:11.28 --> 00:05:15.68 Throughout the day, primary and secondary explosions followed one another as the strikes
00:05:15.68 --> 00:05:17.80 found their mark.
00:05:17.80 --> 00:05:22.20 Whenever the team's fate, whatever the team's fate might turn out to be, the NVA were
00:05:22.20 --> 00:05:26.84 paying a hellacious price for messing with it.
00:05:26.84 --> 00:05:32.84 With daylight, ammunition and ideas running out, it was like a true message from God when
00:05:32.84 --> 00:05:39.08 Watkins heard Kavi report that South Vietnamese Air Force 219 Special Operations Squadron
00:05:39.08 --> 00:05:43.52 had one of its legendary King Bees and route.
00:05:43.52 --> 00:05:48.12 For once, Watkins spirits actually rose.
00:05:48.12 --> 00:05:52.56 Not that he didn't love the living daylights out of the 7th Air Cavs, but the Vietnamese
00:05:52.56 --> 00:06:00.28 of the 219th had time after time after time, proven themselves to be about the most daring,
00:06:00.28 --> 00:06:07.64 most imaginative, most aggressive, and all around finest pilots on the face of the globe.
00:06:07.64 --> 00:06:12.96 If RT Lyon had any chance of getting out of this hellhole, a King Beep pilot was the one
00:06:12.96 --> 00:06:20.28 who would find it and exploit it no matter how slight the chance was or how deadly the odds.
00:06:20.28 --> 00:06:26.36 That was simply what they were pledged and committed to doing day after day.
00:06:26.36 --> 00:06:31.000 Our good news followed when Kavi relayed that the lone King Be would be escorted by Marine
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.28 gunships from 8ML367, a bad bunch of fires that went by the code named Scarface.
00:06:39.28 --> 00:06:42.32 Things were definitely going to rock and roll with them on station.
00:06:42.32 --> 00:06:46.92 Scarface enjoyed nothing more than kicking NVA but and taking names and then coming back
00:06:46.92 --> 00:06:50.16 around to kick more but just for good measure.
00:06:50.16 --> 00:06:55.16 On general principle and for the sheer fun of it.
00:06:55.16 --> 00:07:00.68 However Kavi splashed a healthy dose of cold water on walkins by reminding him it was very
00:07:00.68 --> 00:07:05.64 nearly dark and that despite all the bombs dropped, rockets fired and gun runs made.
00:07:05.64 --> 00:07:10.68 The enemy was still pumping out an enormous amount of fire and still moving forward.
00:07:10.68 --> 00:07:15.36 Pulling RT Lyon out of Oscar was going to be as difficult and dangerous in extraction
00:07:15.36 --> 00:07:17.48 as could be imagined.
00:07:17.48 --> 00:07:20.32 And they would have just one chance to pull it off.
00:07:20.32 --> 00:07:25.36 If they muffed it, RT Lyon would be spending the night and would most likely not see the
00:07:25.36 --> 00:07:27.72 next morning.
00:07:27.72 --> 00:07:31.72 So-boring information indeed but walkins did not want to discourage his team so he just
00:07:31.72 --> 00:07:37.000 gave them his best grin and said let's get ready to go.
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.40 In the distance walkins could hear the distinctive sound of the old 9 piston, Sechorsky
00:07:43.40 --> 00:07:49.20 H34 King Beech shoving its way along a steady base note to the higher walk-wop of the
00:07:49.20 --> 00:07:50.76 Louise.
00:07:50.76 --> 00:07:55.80 He squinted into the twilight and when he could finally make out their dim silhouettes,
00:07:55.80 --> 00:08:01.12 he flashed his stroke through the barrel of an M79 grenade launcher so as to mask it from
00:08:01.12 --> 00:08:03.16 enemy sight.
00:08:03.16 --> 00:08:09.04 The helicopter's acknowledged having RT Lyon's mark and the Louise immediately divided
00:08:09.04 --> 00:08:13.44 and made a split run, one raking the team's forward perimeter with rockets and machine gun
00:08:13.44 --> 00:08:15.44 fire and the other working its rear.
00:08:15.44 --> 00:08:18.64 It was a beautiful show.
00:08:18.64 --> 00:08:22.80 The walkins yelled over the noise to blow all the claymores by setting off all the claymores
00:08:22.80 --> 00:08:27.32 at once he hoped to avoid having any uninvited NVA join the team.
00:08:27.32 --> 00:08:33.80 They went off in a deafening blast and blinding flash, the little mouse had roared.
00:08:33.80 --> 00:08:38.40 As the scar face duo looped around to make their second final run, they confirmed there
00:08:38.40 --> 00:08:43.56 were dozens of dead and dying NVA scattered around within feet of the bomb crater.
00:08:43.56 --> 00:08:46.68 Unfortunately they also saw more troops advancing.
00:08:46.68 --> 00:08:50.12 It was down to the short strokes.
00:08:50.12 --> 00:08:55.20 As the scar face gunships began their last pass, the king be tucked itself in behind
00:08:55.20 --> 00:08:58.12 them and came roaring on.
00:08:58.12 --> 00:09:03.28 Rather than sat down outside the crater and have the team come to him, as Watkins fully
00:09:03.28 --> 00:09:07.56 expected the pilot pulled up and hovered over the crater.
00:09:07.56 --> 00:09:13.40 As the team looked up and disbelief, the old aged 34 warbird began gently settling itself
00:09:13.40 --> 00:09:17.16 down toward the team like a mother hand about to cover her chicks.
00:09:17.16 --> 00:09:21.76 Thus also decreasing the silhouette to enemy troops.
00:09:21.76 --> 00:09:27.60 By the light of the burning elephant grass, Watkins was able to see into the king bees
00:09:27.60 --> 00:09:33.48 cocked it and was startled to find the copilot seat empty.
00:09:33.48 --> 00:09:40.28 In the pilot seat was as much admired friend Captain On, a man who had saved Watkins
00:09:40.28 --> 00:09:47.96 bacon on many other occasions, but none quite like what he faced here at Oscar 8.
00:09:47.96 --> 00:09:52.10 Captain On lowered his king be toward the team with a precision and steadiness that
00:09:52.10 --> 00:09:56.40 gave an entirely new meaning to the word cool.
00:09:56.40 --> 00:10:00.64 His face was smooth and calm, but there was steel in his eyes as he worked both feet
00:10:00.64 --> 00:10:04.44 and hands to maneuver the choppers close to RT line as he could.
00:10:04.44 --> 00:10:09.96 At one point Watkins could have sworn that On nodded to him as if an occasional greeting.
00:10:09.96 --> 00:10:13.76 The whole scene bordered on surrealistic.
00:10:13.76 --> 00:10:18.60 What would the LZ lit by a flickering brush fire, the sounds of gunfire and explosions,
00:10:18.60 --> 00:10:26.44 the smell of cordite and burned human flesh, and this improbable savior hovering above.
00:10:26.44 --> 00:10:31.44 As Watkins had experienced before, the action took on a dreamlike quality sounds faded as
00:10:31.44 --> 00:10:35.56 if someone had turned down the volume, the air thickened, movement appeared to be in slow
00:10:35.56 --> 00:10:40.36 motion, and the brain snapped individual frames that would never ever be forgotten.
00:10:40.36 --> 00:10:45.24 The looks of fear or pain on their faces, bodies being blasted backward, a piece of
00:10:45.24 --> 00:10:50.56 someone on the ground, a scrap of cloth, one's own hand clutching a weapon or shaking wildly
00:10:50.56 --> 00:10:55.52 as it tries to execute some simple well rehearsed, but now impossible difficult task.
00:10:55.52 --> 00:10:59.52 This is what Watkins looks like to a mind-understress.
00:10:59.52 --> 00:11:04.44 Watkins could hear small arms fire thumping into the king be as body as he fully expected
00:11:04.44 --> 00:11:10.12 that at any moment it would either pull up an exit or come crashing down on them.
00:11:10.12 --> 00:11:11.84 But it did neither.
00:11:11.84 --> 00:11:19.12 It settled into a stationary hover, its front wheels placed delicately inside the crater.
00:11:19.12 --> 00:11:25.52 And there it sat, an unbelievable vision, a heroic portrait of an old warrior taking a pounding
00:11:25.52 --> 00:11:29.88 but refusing to falter.
00:11:29.88 --> 00:11:34.60 Watkins, DeSata, and Godwin begin heaving the brew into the chopper.
00:11:34.60 --> 00:11:35.60 Godwin followed.
00:11:35.60 --> 00:11:41.40 DeSata after taking an anxious look at his team leader was next, his bright red star pointed
00:11:41.40 --> 00:11:46.76 over his right ear as if he wasn't quite sure whether he wanted to be going or staying.
00:11:46.76 --> 00:11:51.40 Finally in accordance with that time-honored tradition, the one-zero feet with a last
00:11:51.40 --> 00:11:55.32 to leave the killing ground of Oscar eight.
00:11:55.32 --> 00:12:00.24 With the door gunner and team pouring small arms fire and M79 rounds into the perimeter
00:12:00.24 --> 00:12:07.04 beyond its rim, the king lifted up and out of the crater.
00:12:07.04 --> 00:12:11.64 As a last to find gesture, Watkins threw a red smoke grenade onto the LZ.
00:12:11.64 --> 00:12:16.44 This gesture was universally understood by everyone who supported Saga to signal that
00:12:16.44 --> 00:12:21.92 the team was safely out, the LZ clear and everyone else was free to pound the living
00:12:21.92 --> 00:12:24.84 daylights out of it.
00:12:24.84 --> 00:12:29.000 Their RT line was not home-free, not yet at least.
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.92 Anti-aircraft rounds were bursting around them like a World War II Akak fire.
00:12:33.92 --> 00:12:38.64 Captain Onn was dipping and juking in an effort to judge the dodge the bursts and make
00:12:38.64 --> 00:12:40.92 himself harder to track.
00:12:40.92 --> 00:12:46.52 He still looked calm, cool, and collected as if he were making a routine flight.
00:12:46.52 --> 00:12:52.84 For these guys, Watkins, maybe this was a routine flight.
00:12:52.84 --> 00:12:58.56 In the king be touched down a case on, Tassada, Godwin, and the grinning door gunner walked
00:12:58.56 --> 00:13:02.36 around poking their fingers into bullet holes and counting them.
00:13:02.36 --> 00:13:04.76 But they soon gave up.
00:13:04.76 --> 00:13:06.20 There were too many.
00:13:06.20 --> 00:13:13.84 In besides it was just too unsettling, unsettling to contemplate what might have been.
00:13:13.84 --> 00:13:19.68 Watkins learned later that Captain Onn had chosen to fly solo in the Oscar eight because
00:13:19.68 --> 00:13:23.32 he knew exactly how dangerous this mission was.
00:13:23.32 --> 00:13:31.000 He'd lost King Bees there before and was determined not to risk more lives than necessary.
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.52 He figured if the gods were damed that his ship go down while trying to save RT line,
00:13:36.52 --> 00:13:40.56 it would just be him and the door gunner.
00:13:40.56 --> 00:13:43.80 It seemed like a simple and perfectly logical decision.
00:13:43.80 --> 00:13:46.80 No big deal.
00:13:46.80 --> 00:13:51.12 Incredibly everyone who participated in the mission was alive and well.
00:13:51.12 --> 00:13:56.88 But men of RT line were home, seasoned veterans of Oscar eight.
00:13:56.88 --> 00:14:06.60 It had indeed been there time after all.
00:14:06.60 --> 00:14:18.56 So that is a whole different kind of heroism.
00:14:18.56 --> 00:14:24.20 Because look when you're on the ground, in many cases you don't even have a choice,
00:14:24.20 --> 00:14:26.56 but to be a hero.
00:14:26.56 --> 00:14:31.36 You either step up or you die.
00:14:31.36 --> 00:14:42.40 But for these pilots, men like Captain Onn, they don't really have to do anything heroic.
00:14:42.40 --> 00:14:45.56 They could easily say that the landing zones too hot or they've already been shot or
00:14:45.56 --> 00:14:51.72 the low on fuel or whatever.
00:14:51.72 --> 00:14:54.24 But they're safe in their aircraft.
00:14:54.24 --> 00:14:59.92 And they see the hell that is going on and they see the hell that they are going into.
00:14:59.92 --> 00:15:07.44 They call it's and rockets and anti-aircraft and they go anyway.
00:15:07.44 --> 00:15:10.48 They go anyway.
00:15:10.48 --> 00:15:18.56 Men like Captain Noin Key Arn, a pilot in the South Vietnamese Air Force who flew countless
00:15:18.56 --> 00:15:24.96 missions in saintly dangerous missions in support of American and South Vietnamese
00:15:24.96 --> 00:15:33.48 sog teams. These are recipient of the silver star and the distinguished flying cross.
00:15:33.48 --> 00:15:39.000 And it is an absolute honor to have Captain Onn with us here to talk about his experience
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.72 in fighting in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
00:15:44.72 --> 00:15:49.72 Captain Onn, it's an absolute honor to have here.
00:15:49.72 --> 00:15:58.60 But I guess also joining us once again is John Strike or Meyer, till Special Forces member
00:15:58.60 --> 00:16:01.60 of Sog who has been on this podcast before.

00:16:23.68 --> 00:16:27.48 to if I could find a king bee pilot.
00:16:27.48 --> 00:16:32.84 And I know as soon as you very quickly mentioned Captain Onn.

00:16:42.40 --> 00:16:43.40 Where did you grow up?
00:16:43.40 --> 00:16:50.40 I would grow up at Hanway, not at Vietnam.
00:16:50.40 --> 00:16:56.88 My father decided to move to family to the South in 1954.
00:16:56.88 --> 00:17:00.32 That was after the French got beat.
00:17:00.32 --> 00:17:03.92 So did your father recognize the bad things could happen?
00:17:03.92 --> 00:17:04.92 Yes.
00:17:04.92 --> 00:17:07.28 And what did your father do for a living?
00:17:07.28 --> 00:17:14.28 Did you meet before in the 55th of the 54th?
00:17:14.28 --> 00:17:17.28 He has some kind of business to cut the lumber.
00:17:17.28 --> 00:17:19.28 Like a long ago.
00:17:19.28 --> 00:17:25.28 He high people to do it when he organized the office.
00:17:25.28 --> 00:17:34.28 And after the 54th we moved down to the South.
00:17:34.28 --> 00:17:40.000 They looked for one of the French company.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000 He worked for a French company?
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000 Yes.
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000 Okay.
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000 After the 54th.
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000 Then he moved to the South.
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000 Okay.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000 And what did you do?
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000 How old were you when you moved to the South?
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000 I was 15, 11.
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000 11 years old.
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000 Yeah.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.84 And my father sent my son and my brother.
00:17:58.84 --> 00:18:08.72 A young brother at that time, he was 10 and to try to with one of the French to the South.
00:18:08.72 --> 00:18:14.84 Now did you have any understanding of what was happening with the communist and North Vietnam?
00:18:14.84 --> 00:18:18.04 Did you have any understanding of that yet?
00:18:18.04 --> 00:18:28.48 Before we went to the South, then I remember.
00:18:28.48 --> 00:18:33.60 At night, I see the next to my father.
00:18:33.60 --> 00:18:42.000 He was a police officer, a police officer, a police officer, which he made because my
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.96 brother, who was killed in 45.
00:18:49.96 --> 00:18:51.36 When he was 17.
00:18:51.36 --> 00:18:52.36 Okay.
00:18:52.36 --> 00:18:53.36 By the communist.
00:18:53.36 --> 00:18:54.36 The communist.
00:18:54.36 --> 00:18:55.36 Yeah.
00:18:55.36 --> 00:19:01.44 So, once you got down the South Vietnam, now you're 11 years old.
00:19:01.44 --> 00:19:03.32 And what did you do?
00:19:03.32 --> 00:19:04.72 Were you just going to school?
00:19:04.72 --> 00:19:06.56 Yes, I did.
00:19:06.56 --> 00:19:18.68 And since we moved around on the time, I know it to high funk and then go to the South.
00:19:18.68 --> 00:19:27.08 And my brother, next to me, we are on try to make a two great in one year.
00:19:27.08 --> 00:19:28.44 You try to make what in one year?
00:19:28.44 --> 00:19:29.44 Two great.
00:19:29.44 --> 00:19:30.44 Okay.
00:19:30.44 --> 00:19:33.44 Were you able to do it?
00:19:33.44 --> 00:19:34.44 Yeah.
00:19:34.44 --> 00:19:35.44 Okay.
00:19:35.44 --> 00:19:36.44 We did.
00:19:36.44 --> 00:19:37.44 Nice.
00:19:37.44 --> 00:19:37.44 Nice.
00:19:37.44 --> 00:19:41.12 And in 62.
00:19:41.12 --> 00:19:48.12 In 62, I was on the Air Force.
00:19:48.12 --> 00:19:54.20 My brother, he got a scholarship from Usham and he went here too.
00:19:54.20 --> 00:19:58.04 So 1962 is when you joined the Air Force.
00:19:58.04 --> 00:20:03.64 And once you joined the Air Force, did you know you were going to be a pilot?
00:20:03.64 --> 00:20:04.64 Yes.
00:20:04.64 --> 00:20:05.64 Okay.
00:20:05.64 --> 00:20:12.64 But I didn't believe that I would be.
00:20:12.64 --> 00:20:14.92 I couldn't ride the car, I couldn't ride air.
00:20:14.92 --> 00:20:18.88 You were there when you were even ever in a bus.
00:20:18.88 --> 00:20:24.88 Because every time I got in the car, my stomach was like, come up to my mouth.
00:20:24.88 --> 00:20:26.88 You're a car, sir.
00:20:26.88 --> 00:20:28.88 Chaucic train, sir.
00:20:28.88 --> 00:20:29.88 Every day.
00:20:29.88 --> 00:20:30.88 Here we get.
00:20:30.88 --> 00:20:32.84 Yeah, that's not fun.
00:20:32.84 --> 00:20:34.84 But eventually you were able to get over that?
00:20:34.84 --> 00:20:35.84 Yes.
00:20:35.84 --> 00:20:45.36 The first time I'm my IP, he demonstrated the engine quit all the oral total tasting.
00:20:45.36 --> 00:20:50.04 And I feel my stomach is coming up.
00:20:50.04 --> 00:20:53.60 I can't hear how can I fly.
00:20:53.60 --> 00:20:55.92 But they are on, I get used with it.
00:20:55.92 --> 00:20:56.92 Right.
00:20:56.92 --> 00:21:00.20 And I like it.
00:21:00.20 --> 00:21:03.16 I know that they have something for American pilots.
00:21:03.16 --> 00:21:04.60 And I don't know if they made you do this.
00:21:04.60 --> 00:21:08.48 They have something where if you get air sickness, they have something I think it's in
00:21:08.48 --> 00:21:09.48 taxes.
00:21:09.48 --> 00:21:11.24 It's called Spin and Puk.
00:21:11.24 --> 00:21:15.36 And they basically put you in this machine every day and it spins you around and makes
00:21:15.36 --> 00:21:17.96 you sick until you get used to it.
00:21:17.96 --> 00:21:18.96 Really?
00:21:18.96 --> 00:21:19.96 Yep.
00:21:19.96 --> 00:21:22.88 So I guess you didn't do that.
00:21:22.88 --> 00:21:23.88 No.
00:21:23.88 --> 00:21:26.88 You didn't have to go to the Spin and Puk.
00:21:26.88 --> 00:21:29.24 One auto rotation helps.
00:21:29.24 --> 00:21:36.24 So how long were you in the Air Force before you started training to become a pilot?
00:21:36.24 --> 00:21:51.64 When I was in Air Force in late 1962, and formerly it was on the very first of the 63.
00:21:51.64 --> 00:21:59.20 I was having the basic terminally training in the Nya Shank for the ESI-off course.
00:21:59.20 --> 00:22:02.20 So for six months.
00:22:02.20 --> 00:22:12.04 And in Zurai, 63, I was sent here to get a tiny.
00:22:12.04 --> 00:22:13.44 So you came to America?
00:22:13.44 --> 00:22:17.68 Yeah, and got the ESI-algan training in the industry.
00:22:17.68 --> 00:22:18.68 In the San Antonio.
00:22:18.68 --> 00:22:19.68 Okay.
00:22:19.68 --> 00:22:26.20 So you go to San Antonio to first of all, how to speak English?
00:22:26.20 --> 00:22:29.20 Oh, in Vietnam.
00:22:29.20 --> 00:22:30.20 Okay.
00:22:30.20 --> 00:22:38.68 When I kept the ability to be literally training and the ESI-al in English training for
00:22:38.68 --> 00:22:47.84 six months, and then when I went to the San Antonio Tigers, another four months for
00:22:47.84 --> 00:22:56.16 ESL in English, in English, after that I went to four waters in Texas.
00:22:56.16 --> 00:22:57.16 Okay.
00:22:57.16 --> 00:22:58.16 And what was the first one?
00:22:58.16 --> 00:22:59.16 The first one was for?
00:22:59.16 --> 00:23:02.16 Probably, how do you go to training?
00:23:02.16 --> 00:23:03.16 Okay.
00:23:03.16 --> 00:23:06.16 Is the ESI-algan training three?
00:23:06.16 --> 00:23:07.16 The ESI-23.
00:23:07.16 --> 00:23:08.16 The ESI-23.
00:23:08.16 --> 00:23:09.16 The ESI-23.
00:23:09.16 --> 00:23:12.16 It's small and ugly.
00:23:12.16 --> 00:23:15.16 That's like the bubble canopy, right?
00:23:15.16 --> 00:23:16.16 Simultaneously.
00:23:16.16 --> 00:23:19.16 Yeah, it's a very, very old one.
00:23:19.16 --> 00:23:27.16 And then, so how long did you spend in America training the fly?
00:23:27.16 --> 00:23:37.72 From the first training, I had the advanced training on ESI-23, to then after
00:23:37.72 --> 00:23:44.000 happiness, I went to Alabama to get the training on the ESL-24.
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000 The Kingby.
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000 The Kingby.
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000 What was your first impression of the Kingby?
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000 It was big.
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000 Because it was from the ESI-23.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000 It was small one.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000 It was training one.
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:09.000 And when I finished the training on the ESI-24, I was thankful to get the training on the
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000 Huey.
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000 At that time, they only have the school.
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000 They only have the A model.
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000 It's a smaller one.
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000 The A model Huey?
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000 Yeah.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000 What did you like better?
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000 The Huey or the Kingby?
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000 It's a kidney.
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000 It's a kidney.
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000 It had the Bail.
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000 At that time, it was about 150 hundred house power.
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000 But the Huey wasn't A model.
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000 He was only 900 house power.
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000 But the Huey is a lot smaller than the Kingby.
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000 Yes, it is small.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000 But did you feel like you had more power in the Kingby?
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000 No.
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000 No.
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000 Because it's too easy.
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000 Too easy to fry.
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000 What's that one?
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:05.000 Because on the ESI-24, I got told about how it's.
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000 How many hours?
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000 Hundred hours.
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000 Wow.
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000 But on the Huey, I only had the 900 hours.
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000 Okay.
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000 And the pilot, Captain Bylode, who checked me, he said,
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000 Okay.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000 He's a good stay home.
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000 You don't need to fry anymore.
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000 He's the home.
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000 He can have more time to take out of people.
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000 God.
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000 Other people don't learn as quickly as he did.
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000 God.
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000 So I was awful one week and this girl ran.
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000 So then, so is that what you got trained in?
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000 You completed all that training.
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000 And then it was going back to Vietnam.
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000 Yes, in the 61.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000 Around the Zoolai 64.
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:03.000 So in 64 America's there, but not super heavy engaged in combat operations yet.
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000 What was it like when you got back?
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000 Were you starting to anticipate?
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000 Were you starting to seem like there was going to be a broader war being fought there?
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.60 Don't forget, June on 1964, Roger Dollen, earned the first Medal of Honor at a Green
00:26:19.60 --> 00:26:21.000 Brey camp.
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000 So there were major battles at the A camps, at that level.
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000 And so, and the course that King Bees, even then, were supporting somebody at the A camps.
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000 So that was the beginning of that war at a serious level.
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000 And yes, we didn't get the American troops involved to hydranny Valley, but they began to build up
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000 the Marines came into today.
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000 So he was all part of that.
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000 What year did the Marines come into the day?
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000 There was 64 I think.
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000 Yes, 64, 64, 64, 64.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000 Yeah, because it's always hydrang in 65.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000 That sort of, in my mind, marks the beginning of like heavy American combat operations.
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000 Yes, it has a formal battle between American first cab and the NVA.
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000 So, but yeah, definitely prior to that, it was advisors in their working by-with-and-through
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000 the locals.
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000 Right.
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000 And yeah.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000 So you are seeing all that happen.
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000 You're seeing that start to unfold.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000 Where you, at what point did you start flying the King Bees in support of special operations?
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:31.000 When I first came back from the U.S. training, I was assigned to the...
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000 2017 squad.
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000 And the 2017 squad, the first station at Saigon.
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:48.000 And in the 60, later 65, was moved to Cantel in the south.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:00.000 And in February, 1966, I was assigned to the 80-thirds of the military.
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000 The 80-thirds group.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:11.000 This is the group that combine face-wing and helicopter to verify the sacred mission.
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:20.000 And later on, the helicopter-through group become a two-nineteen.
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000 But the group of the 80, the helicopter group in 80-thirds,
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000 and it's basically a heavy-fledged helicopter.
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000 But when we become, became the two-nineteen, we have about 34 of them.
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000 Did you know what you were getting into?
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000 Yeah.
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000 Were those kind of...
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000 I like it.
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000 And because he's very modest.
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000 The first two years, basically, from...
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000 He went to the first the 2017, the commander that didn't like North Vietnamese.
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000 So he was only a cop-out.
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000 But he applied cop-out.
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000 He gave very bored, he wants more action.
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000 So he finally gets to be questioned.
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000 And he goes and gets the action.
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000 So once you started doing that, what was that like?
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000 What was it like to start going out on those operations where there was all this incredible intensity on the ground?
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000 Oh, I think he's more excited than in a normal squad.
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000 Yeah, I'd say it's probably more exciting than in a normal squadron.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000 Oh, dude.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000 What was the operational pace like?
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000 How often were you getting called to fly?
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000 What would happen?
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000 Would you be on standby waiting to go extract people?
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000 Would you sit and plan with the guys from SOG?
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000 So you all were working together?
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000 How did all that work?
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000 Everything.
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000 I woke up like that.
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000 Because they had a rotation.
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000 Like one week they would be on assignment, one week they'd be training.
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000 And another week they'd be getting ready.
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000 And then one week or so they'd be on a side.
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000 They could be able to food by.
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000 Yeah.
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000 Then they go down a contone.
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000 Wherever the most bending on a weather, what missions were up.
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000 So would SOG ground guys go and, you know, would you sit down and say, okay,
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000 here's where we're going to insert.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000 Here's where we go up, order.
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000 And they would be in for the briefing.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000 Practing on.
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000 Before we went out to the operation that we have the briefing.
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000 What we are going to do and where we are going to work.
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.000 But since I was also familiar with the whole board from
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:49.000 Hesign down to Praco, Mami to the whole water around the island.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000 And always the whole team in 12.
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000 I'm so familiar with it.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000 I just, yeah.
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000 I don't need to bring map.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000 You were that familiar with it.
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000 Yeah.
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000 Here's another thing.
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000 During those briefings, when they're there as a one zero,
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000 the king bees, as we went further into the war,
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000 we were saying we found 23 mic mic here.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000 37 mic anti-aircraft weaponry in those targets.
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000 So they would tell the cubby and their expertise would be another bonus
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000 that we had in terms of our briefing.
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000 We're not the fly.
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000 That's one of the briefing parts.
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000 So it's like we hear what the mission was.
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000 Get that from S3.
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000 But we'd always hear from them than the cubby after that.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000 Oh yeah.
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000 So you'd be flying basically some kind of combat mission every day
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000 or two days, three days at the most.
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000 Oh, sometimes in one day we are through a three mission.
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000 It's mission last about less than two hours.
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000 Yeah.
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000 Yeah, see, that's what's cool about being a pilot, right?
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000 Two hours, you know, two hours in your dog.
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000 If you live to come home, you're going to have to come home.
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000 You're doing all right.
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000 You're back eating good shall and drinking a cold beer.
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000 Indeed.
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:15.000 So how long did it take before you finally ended up getting shot down?
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000 Ooh.
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000 They should get.
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000 Like when did I know you ended up getting shot down?
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000 How long were you flying for before you got shot down for the first time?
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000 Over four years.
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000 Over four years.
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000 Over five years.
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000 Over five years.
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000 Over seven times.
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000 I don't remember.
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000 Because I was at that point high at four times.
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000 And I was at that point four times.
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000 Yeah.
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000 I don't remember.
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000 I don't even remember which day we were at that.
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000 I said the last time I lost my hand.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000 Can you remember that?
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000 Yeah.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000 The first time you got shot.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000 You don't really remember what happened.
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000 The first time you got shot down.
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000 Oh.
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000 The first time I was shot down was in south of the Mabu mountain.
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000 And in the morning we suppose to take the.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000 They put to make the security line south of the Mabu mountain.
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000 And in Marble, Mabu, right where F would be four was.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000 So this is the in country mission.
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000 And they're picking up a batting to put it on the south side of Marble, Mabu.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000 Because F would be four was on a north side.
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000 And they were having some issues.
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000 They put the batting out there for security purposes.
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000 The work and the long with the Marines at that point.
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000 And so something clocked in the morning.
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000 South Vietnam.
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000 He gets shot down.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000 Yeah.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000 Yeah.
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000 And I will now at sea so clock.
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000 And in South the.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000 I'm a drop the.
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000 The two.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000 And when the second king, the land.
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000 And he said that he kept.
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000 He kept. He caught the.
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000 The ground fine.
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000 And I told him.
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000 Remember which way.
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000 And.
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000 And I come back to.
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000 Mabu mountain pick up more people.
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000 And then land again.
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000 And I see which.
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000 Which direction is that.
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000 He said to a clock.
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000 And I take up and have to two two.
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000 A couple of.
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000 A little direction.
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000 And I saw a line of the people.
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000 And I was moving.
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000 With the.
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000 I was.
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000 I was a woman and she got killed.
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000 And with the.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000 But you know, Mabu too much.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000 The carry.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000 Yes.
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:30.000 Yeah.
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000 And I told the.
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000 The.
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000 The.
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000 The.
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000 The people.
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000 The civilian people.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000 The.
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000 The.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.000 The.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.000 The.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000 And as long as I.
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000 I.
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000 I.
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000 I.
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000 A.
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.000 A.
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000 A.
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000 Long.
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000 The.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000 But the.
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000 The.
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000 And.
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000 The.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000 The third shop.
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000 The.
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:06.000 The.
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000 People were fake.
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000 During.
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000 XV.
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000 I was like, wow, wow, again, to take the child back.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000 And we took the child back.
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000 The mechanic couldn't find any round.
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:35.000 So, we keep asking me, tell them, tell them, tell them,
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000 what happened, what really happened.
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000 We couldn't find any round, then it must be the technical problem.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000 I said, yes, I heard the round earlier, it was fire.
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000 Later, in the afternoon, one of the mechanic ships,
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:06.000 he opened the Fondar of the engine.
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000 He looked around.
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:19.000 Suddenly, he saw the cap of the needle.
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000 That was the whole thing.
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000 That was it.
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000 He was wondering, why is it this?
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000 That is the whole thing.
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000 The people didn't change it.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000 So, he could call the mechanic and open it.
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000 My wallet was in there.
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000 And that makes it harder to ignite it.
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000 So, you would go back out and you went back out and recovered that aircraft?
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000 Yeah.
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000 Would you tie straps onto it and bring it back or how to do it?
00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:00.000 I go, go out and we did to sew them, how to bring it down the aircraft back.
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000 Would you bring it back with another helicopter?
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000 Yeah.
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000 Tie it on and bring it back and then start working on it.
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000 Did you feel jinks to go back in that aircraft again?
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000 Yeah.
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000 Like, you don't know.
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000 Or did you feel lucky?
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000 You already got shot down, you made it.
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000 You don't win.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000 I was in the rice paddy.
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:32.000 I saw the amount of the chocolate and the amount of the I'm turning.
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000 The old one, the old two, remember seeing that.
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000 And then my true shape, bring a little bit of candy, the arm of the box.
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000 And my co-pie, he ran along with me.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000 When I went back to the I'm literally, I looked back and I saw the one.
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000 The water on the rice paddy was fairly done.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000 Because in the front day they were sweating from the wheelies.
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000 Oh, yeah.
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000 Still.
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:13.000 And then to the bottom of the rice paddy and put it again with the machine gunner and loaded and I shot it.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000 I got idiot, worked.
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000 Only one round in the time.
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000 I didn't want to see it.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000 It was all 30 calories.
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000 We're not the most reliable after the first 30 years of combat.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:39.000 I know there's another story where you got shot down again after.
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000 And the day before, King B had been shot down and then you went into, what happened on that operation?
00:38:45.000 --> 00:39:00.000 The day before we went out and to be surprised and bring the wound from the team.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000 And I ran and picked up some, and I resuppied some.
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000 The second one, let's hide there by the RPC.
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:16.000 And it was about 5 p.m.
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:27.000 And when they saw it, I came back to the back toe.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000 And now we lost two things every time.
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000 Yeah, two things on the previous day.
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:43.000 And I decided, how did you feel about going on an operation when there was two King B shot down the day before?
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000 And now you have to go back in there. What did that feel like?
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:56.000 I think that we need to bring the honor by friend, right?
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:09.000 And when I went to an doctor, the radio man from the camp, he went out and he said,
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000 all the from side gone, no two men anymore.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:21.000 And he lowered his spine, but the last decision is yours.
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000 And I said, oh, I'm going to go again.
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:34.000 And I asked it to go V and the two Renship and my number three, number four.
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:48.000 King B. I will go in again and when we were about, yeah, I told him,
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:58.000 that's a follow me. And when we were about five kilometers from the L.D.
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000 then you people were just updating.
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000 And I will go now by myself.
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:13.000 And I wait until 7 o'clock, a 7 p.m. is dark.
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000 And I say, let's go. And I turn out on my light.
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000 Even the last one, light.
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000 Turn them off. Turn them off.
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000 Very, very, very, very, very faint.
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000 How to see it.
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000 And because anyway, for a far, far, far, long, high,
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:45.000 far, I can listen to the engine and know how much data it was working.
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000 And how much I know how many L.P.M. is running.
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000 I can listen to it.
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000 And when you were about five kilometers from the L.D.
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000 I turned off the light and tell other people to a little bit wait for me.
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000 And I asked the Kobi, do you see me?
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000 And he said that, yes.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:18.000 So I turned off the engine and go down, go down to the top or to three.
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000 Rikovil. And I see him again.
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000 Do you see me? And he said, yes.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000 Okay, guide me.
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000 And you guys tell the light, light, light, light.
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:41.000 And the L.D.R. had and make a 360 with a 90, 90, not go my 360 degree to land on the L.D.
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000 So they were walking you in and telling the Kobi was telling you to tell the Kobi was telling me.
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000 Guide me.
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000 Yeah.
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000 At night.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000 At three top.
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000 In the jungle, this is in the mountains here.
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000 It's not like for flying a camp, booty, where it's flat.
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:09.000 He's flying over the hills to just, and that's just part of one another day with a king be pile at night.
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000 With the lights out.
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000 And he got to everybody out.
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000 Mm-hmm.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000 And the next day, I came in again.
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000 And at the 10 am.
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000 And when I was ticking off.
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000 And I heard a big brush.
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000 And they said, the chopper started to make up.
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000 Because the engine was last.
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000 The brush broke up.
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000 Yeah, broke up.
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000 We broke up the engine.
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000 Wait, what broke up the engine?
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000 Yeah, they didn't fire.
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000 It was hit by the RPE.
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000 Okay, guide me the phone.
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000 Yeah.
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000 I make it the right move to keep the joppers.
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000 Go stick to the side of the hill.
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000 And still, I'm a start-of-the-loaded road.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000 I load the left side down to a so it can hold on the side of the hill.
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000 And it's just mud.
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:31.000 And I say that the koppai, when I come out, I get koppai.
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000 He always on my other left eye.
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000 And I said, the run.
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000 So let's do the next.
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000 I get this.
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000 Your aircraft gets hit with an RPG.
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000 Yeah.
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000 The engine dies.
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000 The engine came off.
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000 The engine came off.
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000 Yeah, it blew off the engine.
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000 Okay.
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000 So now the chopper goes nose up.
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000 Yeah.
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000 You're going to crash land and you have to do it on a hillside.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.000 Yeah.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000 And so you had to maneuver the helicopter to be at the angle.
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000 Yeah.
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000 So you won't be falling a little road out of the hill.
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000 And then, so you land it.
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000 Basically, you are able to crash land it.
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000 And then you look your koppai and say, run.
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000 And then have to heal up.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000 Okay.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000 So you then you joined the de-sag team on the ground.
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000 Yes.
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000 Did you charge the M30 again for good luck?
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000 No.
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000 At that time, we, I'll hit him 60.
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000 Okay.
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000 So you got the M60 off of it?
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000 Yeah.
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000 Yeah.
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000 So then what happened when you joined up with the de-sag team?
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000 The south team, because of the M60 and M18 was...
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000 All over the, the, the, the dish.
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000 And I, I wrapped one of them.
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000 No.
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000 At first I, yeah.
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000 I ended up one of them tried to shoot.
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000 And, who are the de-sag team from?
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000 But the, the, the Indian work, because they shoot,
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000 he shot all of them and the de-sag.
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000 They, uh, ran out of both.
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000 Yeah.
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000 Uh, I think they, uh, they're going to shoot the right.
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000 Oh, the gun was too dry.
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000 Yeah.
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000 I'll go to the shoot and then walk.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000 Okay.
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000 So now you're in a perimeter, I guess, with your team, with the team.
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000 They're wounded.
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000 Yeah.
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000 And this is a wounded people who had picked that team.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000 What team was this?
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000 I'm not sure.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000 Sout a cartoon.
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000 This is before my time, even like, 67.
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000 I think.
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000 So I, I ran around and, uh, in five, and all the, uh,
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000 I'm, uh, 179 again.
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000 Mm-hmm.
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000 And 28-large.
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000 Two-baked, of the, and it, and it.
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000 So I just, okay.
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000 You should, may now, I'll be, uh, maybe, I did, maybe, maybe to you.
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000 I should, I should, I should, I should, I, I am the two-baked,
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000 I will, uh, am until the day.
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:06.000 And, uh, I, uh, I should have been from 15 meters away from us to 200 meters away from us.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000 Yeah, how long were you guys on the ground for before you got extracted?
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000 Oh.
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000 And, uh, when I, uh, after, after I started on a degree,
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000 I, uh, called the decovi.
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000 And, uh, he said, you still like, yeah, I still got that.
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000 And I called my rescue pilot because he, he's, he was on the sky.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000 And he saw the, he said that he, he saw the, uh, the frame,
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000 the line of frame, the row, he, and hit my, uh, chopper and my chopper, I spoke,
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000 you know, the front row, I spoke and he thought that I was not that.
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000 But, like, he, he was not that, and he said, oh, you still like, I see him,
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000 but don't let it in the wall.
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000 We have to move.
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000 Yeah, so here, if that had been a U.E., they're dead.
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000 Everybody's dead, but that's a kingby.
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000 Yeah, the U.E. and the R.P.G.
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000 Hit the engine and blew it out, which is a nine cylinder World War Two engine
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000 from the B-17, but blew it out to aircraft, and he still,
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000 they will talk about it, walk away from it.
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000 Yeah, and crash land that thing.
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000 On the, on the sideways on the hill.
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000 Yeah.
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.000 So, so was the, uh, the other aircraft, the other kingby then land and pick you guys up quickly
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000 or were you out there for a while?
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000 No, we have to, well, we have to run away from the,
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:35.000 away from the L.Z. with the, with the team on 10 a.m. to HOP-M before I was bigger.
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000 So much for the two hour mission.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000 Six hour six hour.
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000 And you're getting shot up by the NVA the whole time?
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000 Yeah, many times.
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000 And he's learning how to shoot the M79 in between the M16 and the M60,
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000 whatever around the has.
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000 On the job training in lay us.
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000 She's. So then you come back from that mission.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000 And then take a shower, get ready, and go brief another mission.
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000 That's what you guys did.
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000 No, after having the mission that I was saw down,
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000 I went back to the, uh, Rob did back to Dr.
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000 And at that time, all of my commander, my squad, the man and the whole staff,
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000 I'll just go out and came down to Dr.
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000 To see what happened.
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000 And it couldn't believe you're still alive.
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000 And yeah.
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:32.000 And when I first, when I first see my, my squad and go man,
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000 I said that my five need to have one week to,
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000 I'm big from a verification to relax.
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000 Did you give it to you?
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000 Yeah, he said, okay.
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000 So all you had to do is take a RPG hit, have your engine blown out,
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000 crash land and do a six hour gun fight with the NVA to get a week's vacation.
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000 I don't know. That seems like a rough tour.
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000 But the, the previous day, one of the job,
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:09.000 I also got him by the RPG and the co-pilot, got killed.
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000 And the pilot and the, and the, and the mechanic and the delicious.
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000 I've burned, burned, burned, burned.
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000 I, I burned from the home.
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000 Yeah.
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000 Yeah.
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.000 And then before the, the next day, before I left the housing,
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000 I went back to the,
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000 the last standing of the,
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000 the, the shop at the Wada,
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000 the, yes, of the, the previously and try to look for something.
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000 The, it's, it's, it's, it's got no remain of the co-pilot of the playlist day.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000 But I couldn't find any.
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000 The whole thing was the,
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000 why us, because the,
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000 the, a club was the aluminum.
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000 Oh, so it just burned.
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000 It's just burned.
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000 Hmm.
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000 That, that wasn't your last time getting shot down.
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000 No, no, no, no.
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000 What about your tail row tail row getting shot off?
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000 Oh, tail row till the little cable.
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000 Um, it was in the house.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000 And I was taken off.
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000 And suddenly I feel somebody hit my,
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000 on my, my food, on my feet.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000 I've been, I've been.
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000 And I asked my,
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000 to bring it out, to thiswald,
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000 If you, you know,
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000 it came down the table.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000 So there was a lot more than the peculiarity,
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000 certificates.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000 Those line, guess what?
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000 What the,
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.90 sum we Chaepp,
00:51:47.90 --> 00:51:50.000 whole finishes from here?
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:50.98 Is certainly.
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000 Yeap Luke?
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000 Y 이거?
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000 The show.
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.50 Saw, um,
00:51:55.50 --> 00:51:57.000 of this 질문.
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.06 Well, we got to go in the room in the other去了
00:51:59.06 --> 00:52:01.54 because programming is the specialty solution,
00:52:01.54 --> 00:52:02.82 but in our table.
00:52:02.82 --> 00:52:05.02 Well, the coaching could be Andrew with the tower's house.
00:52:05.02 --> 00:52:06.50 But we had to calculate that.
00:52:06.50 --> 00:52:10.50 I did the job, but when I was taking it off,
00:52:10.50 --> 00:52:13.50 the job was done to turn right,
00:52:13.50 --> 00:52:16.50 because we don't have the control retail
00:52:16.50 --> 00:52:18.50 to remove the recycling to the left
00:52:18.50 --> 00:52:20.50 and reduce the power.
00:52:20.50 --> 00:52:23.50 And except I accept to be shot
00:52:23.50 --> 00:52:28.50 with other now, rather than grasslanding.
00:52:28.50 --> 00:52:32.50 So I did take it off, it was 60 knots
00:52:32.50 --> 00:52:35.50 and 560 knots, a little bit sideways.
00:52:35.50 --> 00:52:38.50 And it's like from the clouds,
00:52:38.50 --> 00:52:42.50 and I caught my...
00:52:42.50 --> 00:52:45.50 The arting me,
00:52:45.50 --> 00:52:47.50 who had landfills and big pay off
00:52:47.50 --> 00:52:51.50 or the extinct singles.
00:52:51.50 --> 00:52:55.50 Because I helped to make a grass,
00:52:55.50 --> 00:53:00.50 and I made a lot of big traffic
00:53:00.50 --> 00:53:03.50 and land, like a red and landing.
00:53:03.50 --> 00:53:06.50 And the tail wheel, that's down,
00:53:06.50 --> 00:53:07.50 I told my go-back,
00:53:07.50 --> 00:53:09.50 to the power.
00:53:09.50 --> 00:53:12.50 And he got off the power
00:53:12.50 --> 00:53:14.50 and he jumped the cell,
00:53:14.50 --> 00:53:16.50 slowly, slowly, he's head down,
00:53:16.50 --> 00:53:19.50 and he gets not running.
00:53:19.50 --> 00:53:21.50 He's a break,
00:53:21.50 --> 00:53:25.50 and he's back to to to to to to stop it,
00:53:25.50 --> 00:53:27.50 but it was not, but before,
00:53:27.50 --> 00:53:31.50 before I test that, I told my cruise ship,
00:53:31.50 --> 00:53:33.50 and I told him to tell the team,
00:53:33.50 --> 00:53:35.50 9 or 9 of them in the shop,
00:53:35.50 --> 00:53:36.50 and tell the team,
00:53:36.50 --> 00:53:38.50 when I slow down, he's shocked.
00:53:38.50 --> 00:53:40.50 And tell them to jump out.
00:53:40.50 --> 00:53:43.50 The 9 man team.
00:53:43.50 --> 00:53:44.50 Tell them to not do that,
00:53:44.50 --> 00:53:45.50 not to remain,
00:53:45.50 --> 00:53:48.50 because we can make a class.
00:53:48.50 --> 00:53:51.50 And try to need the,
00:53:51.50 --> 00:53:53.50 to jump,
00:53:53.50 --> 00:53:56.50 to the right and stop.
00:53:56.50 --> 00:53:57.50 But I looked down,
00:53:57.50 --> 00:53:59.50 like, no, no, damn jump out.
00:53:59.50 --> 00:54:02.50 Is he still, is he jumping?
00:54:02.50 --> 00:54:05.50 Man.
00:54:05.50 --> 00:54:08.50 And any of the 9 members of the team get wounded,
00:54:08.50 --> 00:54:10.50 one guy was wounded?
00:54:10.50 --> 00:54:12.50 No, nobody's wounded.
00:54:12.50 --> 00:54:14.50 But yet they shot the rotor,
00:54:14.50 --> 00:54:16.50 they, they, they cable to the rotor.
00:54:16.50 --> 00:54:17.50 Yeah, that's crazy.
00:54:17.50 --> 00:54:18.50 And did the aircraft,
00:54:18.50 --> 00:54:19.50 between the weight,
00:54:19.50 --> 00:54:20.50 and the weight,
00:54:20.50 --> 00:54:21.50 he, just a recycling stick.
00:54:21.50 --> 00:54:22.50 Yeah.
00:54:22.50 --> 00:54:24.50 He flew back sideways and decreased the speed.
00:54:24.50 --> 00:54:26.50 I, I never heard that story.
00:54:26.50 --> 00:54:28.50 This is another one of those,
00:54:28.50 --> 00:54:29.50 oh my God, stories.
00:54:29.50 --> 00:54:31.50 Just another day flying kingby.
00:54:31.50 --> 00:54:32.50 We,
00:54:32.50 --> 00:54:34.50 we kept them on.
00:54:34.50 --> 00:54:38.50 Now you know why we say never one pilot.
00:54:38.50 --> 00:54:40.50 Man.
00:54:40.50 --> 00:54:43.50 I tell you one thing.
00:54:43.50 --> 00:54:45.50 Even at that time,
00:54:45.50 --> 00:54:46.50 we have the, uh,
00:54:46.50 --> 00:54:47.50 good chip.
00:54:47.50 --> 00:54:48.50 Yes.
00:54:48.50 --> 00:54:49.50 But to go for the house out,
00:54:49.50 --> 00:54:51.50 then we can make a lot of things.
00:54:51.50 --> 00:54:52.50 Is that right?
00:54:52.50 --> 00:54:53.50 Yeah.
00:54:53.50 --> 00:54:54.50 Because we,
00:54:54.50 --> 00:54:55.50 you know,
00:54:55.50 --> 00:54:56.50 you know,
00:54:56.50 --> 00:54:58.50 when you go out to this operation,
00:54:58.50 --> 00:55:04.50 the fueling and the thinking of the enemy,
00:55:04.50 --> 00:55:07.50 what they are not thinking.
00:55:07.50 --> 00:55:09.50 We can guess,
00:55:09.50 --> 00:55:10.50 but you know,
00:55:10.50 --> 00:55:12.50 you could guess what they are doing.
00:55:12.50 --> 00:55:15.50 What they are going to do.
00:55:15.50 --> 00:55:17.50 So you're saying that the American,
00:55:17.50 --> 00:55:18.50 the Americans,
00:55:18.50 --> 00:55:20.50 we would do random things.
00:55:20.50 --> 00:55:21.50 But the enemy,
00:55:21.50 --> 00:55:23.50 you kind of knew what they were going to do.
00:55:23.50 --> 00:55:24.50 They fall in patterns.
00:55:24.50 --> 00:55:26.50 We can guess most of them.
00:55:26.50 --> 00:55:27.50 Wow.
00:55:27.50 --> 00:55:33.50 The Americans just go out and receive a little ground fire somewhere.
00:55:33.50 --> 00:55:35.50 And they put the surprise it,
00:55:35.50 --> 00:55:36.50 try to surprise it.
00:55:36.50 --> 00:55:37.50 But for us,
00:55:37.50 --> 00:55:41.50 we can guess where they are going to put again.
00:55:41.50 --> 00:55:42.50 Or,
00:55:42.50 --> 00:55:47.50 or what they are going to plan.
00:55:47.50 --> 00:55:49.50 Because sometimes when,
00:55:49.50 --> 00:55:52.50 one time I was shot,
00:55:52.50 --> 00:55:55.50 I was taking up the Aussie and,
00:55:55.50 --> 00:56:05.50 I heard heavy, heavy ground fire from the high side.
00:56:05.50 --> 00:56:07.50 And I looked back and I saw the,
00:56:07.50 --> 00:56:08.50 and we,
00:56:08.50 --> 00:56:11.50 she did behind the 50-carbo.
00:56:11.50 --> 00:56:13.50 I sure they didn't make.
00:56:13.50 --> 00:56:15.50 Less than 100-year.
00:56:15.50 --> 00:56:18.50 And so I,
00:56:18.50 --> 00:56:21.50 I died out of the bamboo top.
00:56:21.50 --> 00:56:23.50 And back to the exact price.
00:56:23.50 --> 00:56:25.50 But the,
00:56:25.50 --> 00:56:26.50 I escaped,
00:56:26.50 --> 00:56:29.50 but the second king became mean and,
00:56:29.50 --> 00:56:31.50 they made it.
00:56:31.50 --> 00:56:33.50 Second,
00:56:33.50 --> 00:56:35.50 give me a shot down,
00:56:35.50 --> 00:56:36.50 shot down,
00:56:36.50 --> 00:56:37.50 cut fire.
00:56:37.50 --> 00:56:38.50 Wow.
00:56:38.50 --> 00:56:40.50 It's too close.
00:56:40.50 --> 00:56:42.50 Less than 100-year.
00:56:42.50 --> 00:56:43.50 I'm,
00:56:43.50 --> 00:56:48.50 another one,
00:56:48.50 --> 00:56:51.50 until it was telling me about,
00:56:51.50 --> 00:56:52.50 was,
00:56:52.50 --> 00:56:53.50 you,
00:56:53.50 --> 00:56:54.50 you got something hit.
00:56:54.50 --> 00:56:55.50 And you got hit by something.
00:56:55.50 --> 00:56:57.50 And it almost knocked you out of your seat.
00:56:57.50 --> 00:56:58.50 Yes.
00:56:58.50 --> 00:56:59.50 And there was a,
00:56:59.50 --> 00:57:01.50 like a two-inch hole in the back of the king.
00:57:01.50 --> 00:57:02.50 What was that?
00:57:02.50 --> 00:57:04.50 We couldn't find the foul.
00:57:04.50 --> 00:57:06.50 We couldn't find the idea around.
00:57:06.50 --> 00:57:07.50 And I don't,
00:57:07.50 --> 00:57:09.50 what kind of,
00:57:09.50 --> 00:57:10.50 what kind of,
00:57:10.50 --> 00:57:11.50 what kind of,
00:57:11.50 --> 00:57:11.50 what kind of,
00:57:11.50 --> 00:57:12.50 what kind of,
00:57:12.50 --> 00:57:14.50 what kind of,
00:57:14.50 --> 00:57:15.50 what kind of,
00:57:15.50 --> 00:57:16.50 what kind of,
00:57:16.50 --> 00:57:17.50 what kind of,
00:57:17.50 --> 00:57:18.50 what kind of,
00:57:18.50 --> 00:57:18.50 what kind of,
00:57:19.50 --> 00:57:20.50 what kind of,
00:57:20.50 --> 00:57:21.50 what kind of,
00:57:21.50 --> 00:57:23.50 maybe is just one or nothing but family know me for...
00:57:23.50 --> 00:57:25.50 that Day lights,
00:57:25.50 --> 00:57:26.50 and it's certainly,
00:57:26.50 --> 00:57:27.50 this direction.
00:57:27.50 --> 00:57:29.50 That somebody hit me with a hammer in the vacuum.
00:57:29.50 --> 00:57:29.50 That.
00:57:29.50 --> 00:57:29.50 like.
00:57:29.50 --> 00:57:31.50 just hit me for a,
00:57:31.50 --> 00:57:31.50 the get,
00:57:31.50 --> 00:57:32.50 He was like,
00:57:32.50 --> 00:57:32.50 it used,
00:57:32.50 --> 00:57:34.50 can't,
00:57:34.50 --> 00:57:35.50 can't let I go like,
00:57:35.50 --> 00:57:36.50 he simply?
00:57:36.50 --> 00:57:36.50 I thought,
00:57:36.50 --> 00:57:38.50 he did a.
00:57:38.50 --> 00:57:39.50 He did a,
00:57:39.50 --> 00:57:40.50 And he did it and will not,
00:57:40.50 --> 00:57:40.50 He did it.
00:57:40.50 --> 00:57:41.50 Alright,
00:57:41.50 --> 00:57:42.50 I used,
00:57:42.50 --> 00:57:43.50 and then I clean
00:57:43.50 --> 00:57:42.50 I
00:57:42.50 --> 00:57:44.50 team,
00:57:44.50 --> 00:57:46.50 He's glad I.
00:57:46.50 --> 00:57:46.50 I used,
00:57:46.50 --> 00:57:56.50 And when they got home, I checked the law and I saw the bike seat, the bike of my seat.
00:57:56.50 --> 00:58:00.50 The whole bit of this one.
00:58:00.50 --> 00:58:02.50 Yeah.
00:58:02.50 --> 00:58:04.50 And we're finally the one.
00:58:04.50 --> 00:58:07.50 Did you guys, was there any armored all on the Kingby?
00:58:07.50 --> 00:58:08.50 No.
00:58:08.50 --> 00:58:10.50 No armor, just aluminum.
00:58:10.50 --> 00:58:11.50 I don't mean them.
00:58:11.50 --> 00:58:13.50 Can't stop anything.
00:58:13.50 --> 00:58:16.50 I said, oh, yeah, one dead as a one.
00:58:16.50 --> 00:58:17.50 I'm afraid.
00:58:17.50 --> 00:58:19.50 You need to answer the answer.
00:58:19.50 --> 00:58:20.50 Under the answer.
00:58:20.50 --> 00:58:21.50 Yeah, an armor plate.
00:58:21.50 --> 00:58:22.50 Oh, to be honest.
00:58:22.50 --> 00:58:24.50 Maybe 18 inches wide.
00:58:24.50 --> 00:58:28.50 We wrap up on the sides under the easy engine.
00:58:28.50 --> 00:58:30.50 Best about the only armor I'm aware of.
00:58:30.50 --> 00:58:31.50 Yeah.
00:58:31.50 --> 00:58:32.50 Yeah.
00:58:32.50 --> 00:58:33.50 Would you wear?
00:58:33.50 --> 00:58:35.50 Did you wear a flack vest or anything?
00:58:35.50 --> 00:58:36.50 No.
00:58:36.50 --> 00:58:37.50 No point.
00:58:37.50 --> 00:58:38.50 No.
00:58:38.50 --> 00:58:42.50 They're able to cool Kingby flight.
00:58:42.50 --> 00:58:43.50 Just a flight suit.
00:58:43.50 --> 00:58:44.50 Overalls.
00:58:44.50 --> 00:58:52.50 Have their Kingby Siggins on them and they have their holster on their hip like a cowboy.
00:58:52.50 --> 00:58:56.50 They're really good looking uniforms.
00:58:56.50 --> 00:58:59.50 I like the black was best.
00:58:59.50 --> 00:59:03.50 How many operations do you think you flew?
00:59:03.50 --> 00:59:05.50 This guy could eat.
00:59:05.50 --> 00:59:08.50 I got four thousand hours.
00:59:08.50 --> 00:59:14.50 And minus one thousand hours for Ryzen or in the other.
00:59:14.50 --> 00:59:16.50 Other thing.
00:59:16.50 --> 00:59:18.50 So three thousand.
00:59:18.50 --> 00:59:19.50 Two thousand.
00:59:19.50 --> 00:59:20.50 Two thousand.
00:59:20.50 --> 00:59:22.50 Two thousand.
00:59:22.50 --> 00:59:24.50 For each mission.
00:59:24.50 --> 00:59:26.50 So 1500 or so missions.
00:59:26.50 --> 00:59:27.50 Yeah, keep it.
00:59:27.50 --> 00:59:28.50 Keep it.
00:59:28.50 --> 00:59:29.50 Keep it.
00:59:29.50 --> 00:59:32.50 These are all song missions.
00:59:32.50 --> 00:59:33.50 Yeah.
00:59:33.50 --> 00:59:38.48 How often, how often would you have any contact on the ground when you were
00:59:38.48 --> 00:59:39.48 in?
00:59:39.48 --> 00:59:46.48 Usually they.
00:59:46.48 --> 00:59:57.48 When I came in to introduce the team and I saw something.
00:59:57.48 --> 00:59:58.48 One decision.
00:59:58.48 --> 01:00:03.48 Like one time when I went to the airs.
01:00:03.48 --> 01:00:07.48 And I saw the telephone line on the airs.
01:00:07.48 --> 01:00:10.48 And the team was getting off.
01:00:10.48 --> 01:00:13.48 I came back to back.
01:00:13.48 --> 01:00:17.48 And they came back to the one time that I saw it.
01:00:17.48 --> 01:00:20.48 And I bought the bike right away.
01:00:20.48 --> 01:00:26.48 But most of the time when we got shot when we take off from the airs.
01:00:26.48 --> 01:00:29.48 When the team would say it's for the extraction.
01:00:29.48 --> 01:00:30.48 Yeah, for the extraction.
01:00:30.48 --> 01:00:31.48 Yeah.
01:00:31.48 --> 01:00:33.48 So most of the time you could get in.
01:00:33.48 --> 01:00:36.48 Well, you were just pulled the team out almost immediately.
01:00:36.48 --> 01:00:37.48 If you guys took a good time.
01:00:37.48 --> 01:00:40.48 Yeah, if we were compromised and we just try to get it back.
01:00:40.48 --> 01:00:41.48 Go out.
01:00:41.48 --> 01:00:42.48 If we could.
01:00:42.48 --> 01:00:43.48 We're percentage.
01:00:43.48 --> 01:00:45.48 You think you guys were compromised on the insert.
01:00:45.48 --> 01:00:47.48 Probably a lot more than we realized.
01:00:47.48 --> 01:00:48.48 Mm-hmm.
01:00:48.48 --> 01:00:50.48 Could they have had the LC watchers.
01:00:50.48 --> 01:00:53.48 And they would like to get us on the ground first.
01:00:53.48 --> 01:00:55.48 Particularly by the end of 68.
01:00:55.48 --> 01:00:59.48 Could they had the, uh, saw 100 killer teams that were out there.
01:00:59.48 --> 01:01:01.48 They're main mission was to find us.
01:01:01.48 --> 01:01:02.48 Yeah.
01:01:02.48 --> 01:01:04.48 I would think they would want to wait to you inserted.
01:01:04.48 --> 01:01:05.48 Right.
01:01:05.48 --> 01:01:06.48 Let's see you insert.
01:01:06.48 --> 01:01:09.48 Let the helicopter leave and then roll you up.
01:01:09.48 --> 01:01:10.48 There we go.
01:01:10.48 --> 01:01:15.48 So the insert usually would go well on less there days.
01:01:15.48 --> 01:01:20.48 Like we had that time in November where we could get shot out the primary secondary and the
01:01:20.48 --> 01:01:21.48 alternate.
01:01:21.48 --> 01:01:22.48 And the kingbies would go in.
01:01:22.48 --> 01:01:23.48 Bing, Bing, Bing.
01:01:23.48 --> 01:01:24.48 Go have lunch.
01:01:24.48 --> 01:01:26.48 They would refuel have a little lunch.
01:01:26.48 --> 01:01:27.48 There's another target.
01:01:27.48 --> 01:01:29.48 Go back and do it again.
01:01:29.48 --> 01:01:31.48 And often they would come back with bullholes.
01:01:31.48 --> 01:01:34.48 Could we, uh, Lily got shot out there.
01:01:34.48 --> 01:01:35.48 Does any of me activity here?
01:01:35.48 --> 01:01:36.48 We wouldn't go.
01:01:36.48 --> 01:01:37.48 You know, you're compromised.
01:01:37.48 --> 01:01:41.48 You want to try to get them to ground and get going with the mission.
01:01:41.48 --> 01:01:44.48 And we had several days like that back to back to back in the king.
01:01:44.48 --> 01:01:46.48 He's got beat up.
01:01:46.48 --> 01:01:50.48 But fortunately, nothing was got shot down.
01:01:50.48 --> 01:01:52.48 And the Sikorsky's just a beat.
01:01:52.48 --> 01:01:55.48 That's just a, that's just a horse of a aircraft.
01:01:55.48 --> 01:01:56.48 Yeah.
01:01:56.48 --> 01:01:58.48 Only had one door, but it had the windows.
01:01:58.48 --> 01:02:00.48 So whenever we're distracted, our,
01:02:00.48 --> 01:02:04.48 the first man in the chop would go to the, to the, uh, left window.
01:02:04.48 --> 01:02:05.48 You mean the port side?
01:02:05.48 --> 01:02:06.48 Port.
01:02:06.48 --> 01:02:07.48 That's why man.
01:02:07.48 --> 01:02:10.48 How we get the port confusing start.
01:02:10.48 --> 01:02:11.48 Unless I'm drinking port.
01:02:11.48 --> 01:02:14.48 And that's not me man, right there.
01:02:14.48 --> 01:02:15.48 And the left side.
01:02:15.48 --> 01:02:16.48 Yes.
01:02:16.48 --> 01:02:18.48 Is the bull kid secure?
01:02:18.48 --> 01:02:19.48 The bull kid is secure.
01:02:19.48 --> 01:02:20.48 There you go.
01:02:20.48 --> 01:02:21.48 You're all, baby.
01:02:21.48 --> 01:02:25.48 And then right here, we can interject.
01:02:25.48 --> 01:02:29.48 Um,
01:02:29.48 --> 01:02:32.48 sometimes they would be in the air.
01:02:32.48 --> 01:02:36.48 And there would be an emergency call for any helicopter,
01:02:36.48 --> 01:02:39.48 which he did in August of 1969.
01:02:39.48 --> 01:02:44.48 I forget what you were on, but this is that mission with Scarface.
01:02:44.48 --> 01:02:45.48 Mm-hmm.
01:02:45.48 --> 01:02:48.48 And Scarface was making a gun run.
01:02:48.48 --> 01:02:51.48 And they were working conjunction with the, uh,
01:02:51.48 --> 01:02:55.48 the hunter first airborne on their air mobile units.
01:02:55.48 --> 01:02:56.48 Mm-hmm.
01:02:56.48 --> 01:03:01.48 And there was, uh, like a river stream, and they were making a gun run.
01:03:01.48 --> 01:03:03.48 So the hunter first had gone down with the coba.
01:03:03.48 --> 01:03:05.48 They had coba then.
01:03:05.48 --> 01:03:07.48 Scarface came in with a regular gun ship.
01:03:07.48 --> 01:03:08.48 Got hit.
01:03:08.48 --> 01:03:13.48 As it went down, it flipped over to the door to crew members came out.
01:03:13.48 --> 01:03:15.48 It crashed upside down.
01:03:15.48 --> 01:03:19.48 They put out an emergency call on was there.
01:03:19.48 --> 01:03:21.48 He response to the call.
01:03:21.48 --> 01:03:23.48 The gunships went down.
01:03:23.48 --> 01:03:29.48 And they made a gun run on each side of the down upside down Scarface.
01:03:29.48 --> 01:03:31.48 He followed right in.
01:03:31.48 --> 01:03:36.48 And he picked up the two two crew members.
01:03:36.48 --> 01:03:38.48 He picked up with either the,
01:03:38.48 --> 01:03:39.48 No, I didn't pick up the air.
01:03:39.48 --> 01:03:40.48 Just spot them.
01:03:40.48 --> 01:03:41.48 You spot them first?
01:03:41.48 --> 01:03:46.48 Because I, uh, I, I flew along the stream to see what the, uh,
01:03:46.48 --> 01:03:50.48 I, I, I, I identified the people.
01:03:50.48 --> 01:03:55.48 And I spot two of them standing on the big ground about this, this table.
01:03:55.48 --> 01:03:58.48 And I called them like I'm now.
01:03:58.48 --> 01:04:02.48 And they, I keep, so they, they came down to pick them up.
01:04:02.48 --> 01:04:07.48 And I keep, I'd down the, uh, stream to look for other people.
01:04:07.48 --> 01:04:09.48 And I couldn't find any more.
01:04:09.48 --> 01:04:10.48 I come back.
01:04:10.48 --> 01:04:16.48 I came back to the, uh, to the down here with the subside down.
01:04:16.48 --> 01:04:21.48 And I couldn't see anyone, I couldn't see inside the cabin or our cockpit.
01:04:21.48 --> 01:04:26.48 So I used my ride wheel to turn it back.
01:04:26.48 --> 01:04:27.48 Hmm.
01:04:27.48 --> 01:04:28.48 You flipped over the he way.
01:04:28.48 --> 01:04:30.48 Well, under enemy fire.
01:04:30.48 --> 01:04:34.48 And I checked the entire, I just don't know what he's in there.
01:04:34.48 --> 01:04:37.48 So I thought I, I couldn't find any more.
01:04:37.48 --> 01:04:39.48 Then you have your crew chief hang out the door.
01:04:39.48 --> 01:04:40.48 Yeah.
01:04:40.48 --> 01:04:43.48 And then he was able to say that he saw people in the pile of the copouts.
01:04:43.48 --> 01:04:50.48 Uh, because this day, there's two, those are the two, uh, only two scar face marines,
01:04:50.48 --> 01:04:53.48 aviators that are still listed as MIA.
01:04:53.48 --> 01:04:54.48 Oh, that's true.
01:04:54.48 --> 01:04:58.48 I think it was the pilot and, and the crew chief, because the copilot got out.
01:04:58.48 --> 01:05:01.48 And they were able to rescue those two.
01:05:01.48 --> 01:05:05.48 And, uh, and the bubble of the front of the U.E.
01:05:05.48 --> 01:05:07.48 Where he put his, you know, the strut,
01:05:07.48 --> 01:05:10.48 and put the wheel in and lifted up the helicopter.
01:05:10.48 --> 01:05:14.48 And the crew chief goes and hangs out all while under enemy fire.
01:05:14.48 --> 01:05:22.48 So in August 2000, scar face honored on at a banquet in San Diego,
01:05:22.48 --> 01:05:24.48 to thank him for the heroic mission.
01:05:24.48 --> 01:05:28.48 And they helped get your award for the mission to correct.
01:05:28.48 --> 01:05:29.48 Was that part of that?
01:05:29.48 --> 01:05:30.48 Hmm, no yet.
01:05:30.48 --> 01:05:31.48 Not yet.
01:05:31.48 --> 01:05:34.48 But that was one mission where he was just flying.
01:05:34.48 --> 01:05:36.48 And they had to call for help.
01:05:36.48 --> 01:05:38.48 He responded to help scar face.
01:05:38.48 --> 01:05:42.48 Because scar face and the hundred first that protected Kingby's all the time.
01:05:42.48 --> 01:05:44.48 And you got shot up on that one, too.
01:05:44.48 --> 01:05:47.48 It wasn't like we're just another day in the park.
01:05:47.48 --> 01:05:50.48 He's helping the marines try to find those aviators.
01:05:50.48 --> 01:05:52.48 And I'm not sure how many hits he got.
01:05:52.48 --> 01:05:55.48 But just the fact that go down the stream,
01:05:55.48 --> 01:05:59.48 put the strut underneath the front nose had been knocked out and lifted up
01:05:59.48 --> 01:06:02.48 to give them a status report.
01:06:02.48 --> 01:06:03.48 Hmm.
01:06:03.48 --> 01:06:05.48 Just another day with the Kingby's.
01:06:05.48 --> 01:06:06.48 Hmm.
01:06:06.48 --> 01:06:07.48 Amazing.
01:06:07.48 --> 01:06:13.48 Yeah, that, you know, the reputation you guys had must have been just.
01:06:13.48 --> 01:06:16.48 I mean, that opening that I read from this,
01:06:16.48 --> 01:06:18.48 like it's just epic, you know,
01:06:18.48 --> 01:06:22.48 to hear the relief from Watkins,
01:06:22.48 --> 01:06:25.48 who hears who it is, like, okay, now we got a chance.
01:06:25.48 --> 01:06:26.48 Yeah.
01:06:26.48 --> 01:06:30.48 And that was always our golden moment.
01:06:30.48 --> 01:06:32.48 We were on a ground, you're in a firefight,
01:06:32.48 --> 01:06:34.48 and they say the Kingby's are coming.
01:06:34.48 --> 01:06:37.48 It's like, thank God for the Kingby's.
01:06:37.48 --> 01:06:41.48 On that mission, when you decide, hey, you know what?
01:06:41.48 --> 01:06:43.48 I'm not going to bring a co-pilot.
01:06:43.48 --> 01:06:44.48 I'm not going to bring a coup-cheaf.
01:06:44.48 --> 01:06:47.48 I'm just going to bring me and the gunner.
01:06:47.48 --> 01:06:48.48 That's it.
01:06:48.48 --> 01:06:53.48 That seems like that seems like a kind of crazy decision to make.
01:06:53.48 --> 01:06:58.48 Because we, with my wife, I know that the situation was too bad.
01:06:58.48 --> 01:07:02.48 And we have to go out to as fast as we can.
01:07:02.48 --> 01:07:05.48 So we can't bring them home.
01:07:05.48 --> 01:07:08.48 As fast as you can, meaning it would have taken time
01:07:08.48 --> 01:07:10.48 to round up the copilot?
01:07:10.48 --> 01:07:11.48 No.
01:07:11.48 --> 01:07:20.48 If one time when we was, they were put in a motor in a nettle.
01:07:20.48 --> 01:07:26.48 And I saw the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
01:07:26.48 --> 01:07:30.48 it's moke came out from the gun on the other side of the hill.
01:07:30.48 --> 01:07:37.48 And I saw, I, I ran to the my job and the climb up and couldn't get up.
01:07:37.48 --> 01:07:41.48 And when I was taking off, the group of copilot was late.
01:07:41.48 --> 01:07:43.48 And he just cried.
01:07:43.48 --> 01:07:46.48 So you didn't care if you had a copilot or not?
01:07:46.48 --> 01:07:47.48 No, I didn't.
01:07:47.48 --> 01:07:56.48 What was just like that mission later in the book with a chapter 20 when they had the night bright light.
01:07:56.48 --> 01:07:57.48 Yeah.
01:07:57.48 --> 01:07:59.48 Where the hatchet force had been in.
01:07:59.48 --> 01:08:01.48 They had severe casualties.
01:08:01.48 --> 01:08:04.48 They had all been expiltrated out.
01:08:04.48 --> 01:08:11.48 The last helicopter went in was again, you went in on strings to pick up the team leader from the hatchet force.
01:08:11.48 --> 01:08:14.48 They had a sergeant estate back in the couple indigenous troops.
01:08:14.48 --> 01:08:18.48 And the chopper got shot down the crest.
01:08:18.48 --> 01:08:23.48 And then that night they asked to go in and this is October 69.
01:08:23.48 --> 01:08:28.48 And limb black went in and on took them out.
01:08:28.48 --> 01:08:30.48 Again, with no crew.
01:08:30.48 --> 01:08:32.48 They took them out at night.
01:08:32.48 --> 01:08:33.48 Found the LZ.
01:08:33.48 --> 01:08:35.48 They thought they thought they were going to have to repell in.
01:08:35.48 --> 01:08:40.48 But somehow he's able to find an area big enough to get the king be in and went down.
01:08:40.48 --> 01:08:41.48 Lim black got in.
01:08:41.48 --> 01:08:45.48 Picked up the picked up the team member had a broken back.
01:08:45.48 --> 01:08:47.48 And the other survivors.
01:08:47.48 --> 01:08:50.48 And then he came back again at night.
01:08:50.48 --> 01:08:51.48 Picked up the team.
01:08:51.48 --> 01:08:54.48 I think this time they had the pull him out and strings.
01:08:54.48 --> 01:08:56.48 And then they pulled them out.
01:08:56.48 --> 01:09:00.48 Was there anyone else that could fly at night like you could?
01:09:00.48 --> 01:09:02.48 Yes, I'm moving.
01:09:02.48 --> 01:09:04.48 Was it your eyesight?
01:09:04.48 --> 01:09:07.48 Was it just the amount of hours that you had in the helicopter?
01:09:07.48 --> 01:09:10.48 Oh, you know, I can see.
01:09:10.48 --> 01:09:21.48 You know at that time they think they really have the sea model.
01:09:21.48 --> 01:09:26.48 We got from the army.
01:09:26.48 --> 01:09:28.48 We have the ADF, VHS and FM.
01:09:28.48 --> 01:09:30.48 But the D-Morrow.
01:09:30.48 --> 01:09:33.48 We got from the Marine.
01:09:33.48 --> 01:09:40.48 We have detected VHS, VHS, FM.
01:09:40.48 --> 01:09:48.48 But since the Titan and the VHS, we don't use the alphabet.
01:09:48.48 --> 01:09:51.48 We almost never use it. And it's too heavy.
01:09:51.48 --> 01:09:54.48 And it started in the tail boom.
01:09:54.48 --> 01:09:56.48 And it might cause each other heavy.
01:09:56.48 --> 01:09:58.48 Tell you what heavy.
01:09:58.48 --> 01:10:00.48 So I removed all of them.
01:10:00.48 --> 01:10:02.48 You said it was extra radios out.
01:10:02.48 --> 01:10:03.48 Yeah.
01:10:03.48 --> 01:10:09.48 We only needed the EWSF and the FM.
01:10:09.48 --> 01:10:10.48 That's all.
01:10:10.48 --> 01:10:13.48 And this leads me to a quick side bar.
01:10:13.48 --> 01:10:18.48 I don't know if this is you or not, but we had 68.
01:10:18.48 --> 01:10:20.48 The Kingbees had the Marines.
01:10:20.48 --> 01:10:23.48 One of them thraced the Kingbees to Fubai.
01:10:23.48 --> 01:10:25.48 So they had, I mean, just the race.
01:10:25.48 --> 01:10:26.48 A race, race.
01:10:26.48 --> 01:10:27.48 They had their own feet.
01:10:27.48 --> 01:10:30.48 This is just going from Denang, from the Air Base.
01:10:30.48 --> 01:10:32.48 And the Kingbees go, we'll race you to Fubai.
01:10:32.48 --> 01:10:34.48 So Kingbees versus what?
01:10:34.48 --> 01:10:36.48 The first is the Marine Corps, H34s.
01:10:36.48 --> 01:10:38.48 They still have some H34s.
01:10:38.48 --> 01:10:40.48 Oh, so it's just Kingbee versus Kingbee.
01:10:40.48 --> 01:10:41.48 Yeah.
01:10:41.48 --> 01:10:42.48 But Kingbee versus Marine Corps.
01:10:42.48 --> 01:10:44.48 They've got it with all the radios.
01:10:44.48 --> 01:10:49.48 So the Marines had to go around high-van pass and go over to South China Sea.
01:10:49.48 --> 01:10:51.48 Kingbees fly up and over.
01:10:51.48 --> 01:10:52.48 Kingbees.
01:10:52.48 --> 01:10:54.48 They get the Fubai win $100.
01:10:54.48 --> 01:10:57.48 I hope that was your job.
01:10:57.48 --> 01:10:59.48 That was one of our favorite Kingbees stories.
01:10:59.48 --> 01:11:02.48 The freshman always told that one.
01:11:02.48 --> 01:11:04.48 Man.
01:11:04.48 --> 01:11:07.48 And then who's your maintenance crews?
01:11:07.48 --> 01:11:08.48 Oh, yeah.
01:11:08.48 --> 01:11:09.48 Was it Vietnamese?
01:11:09.48 --> 01:11:10.48 Yes.
01:11:10.48 --> 01:11:11.48 Air Force.
01:11:11.48 --> 01:11:13.48 They were in the Air Base.
01:11:13.48 --> 01:11:15.48 They were in the military circles.
01:11:15.48 --> 01:11:19.48 And later on, we got the...
01:11:21.48 --> 01:11:22.48 Let's see.
01:11:22.48 --> 01:11:23.48 What was that?
01:11:23.48 --> 01:11:24.48 I said the Air Force.
01:11:24.48 --> 01:11:27.48 Again, L-O-O-O-D.
01:11:27.48 --> 01:11:31.48 This is American company.
01:11:31.48 --> 01:11:33.48 American company.
01:11:33.48 --> 01:11:34.48 Yeah.
01:11:34.48 --> 01:11:40.48 The main job is to refresh the park.
01:11:40.48 --> 01:11:45.48 I suppose to change the tail rotor.
01:11:45.48 --> 01:11:49.48 They make the whole set and put it up.
01:11:49.48 --> 01:11:52.48 This is a change in the whole set.
01:11:52.48 --> 01:11:55.48 But I don't trust them.
01:11:55.48 --> 01:11:57.48 You know why?
01:11:57.48 --> 01:12:05.48 Because one time after the change the tail rotor.
01:12:05.48 --> 01:12:10.48 And after I checked everything,
01:12:10.48 --> 01:12:14.48 I served to Kaya for the shopping kind of the engine.
01:12:14.48 --> 01:12:18.48 And the shopping kind of happened now.
01:12:18.48 --> 01:12:19.48 Up and down.
01:12:19.48 --> 01:12:24.48 And I just picked up the needle and cut off the engine.
01:12:24.48 --> 01:12:26.48 And the shopping was the craziest.
01:12:26.48 --> 01:12:27.48 I made it.
01:12:27.48 --> 01:12:29.48 It's stuck in the nose come up.
01:12:29.48 --> 01:12:32.48 And I go down and check.
01:12:32.48 --> 01:12:35.48 I checked and checked the tail.
01:12:35.48 --> 01:12:36.48 Oh my god.
01:12:36.48 --> 01:12:38.48 Why is it only one more other three breaks?
01:12:38.48 --> 01:12:40.48 And I remained.
01:12:40.48 --> 01:12:43.48 He's supposed to have a fault break.
01:12:43.48 --> 01:12:44.48 Oh, I don't have a break.
01:12:44.48 --> 01:12:46.48 One was not there.
01:12:46.48 --> 01:12:49.48 Until Roo was MIA.
01:12:49.48 --> 01:12:51.48 I got a wrong one.
01:12:51.48 --> 01:12:52.48 I got a wrong one.
01:12:52.48 --> 01:12:53.48 I got a wrong one.
01:12:53.48 --> 01:12:58.48 Yeah, we had an in Vietnam for the seals in Vietnam.
01:12:58.48 --> 01:13:00.48 They had a similar relationship
01:13:00.48 --> 01:13:05.48 that the saw guys had with the Kimbees with the sea wolves.
01:13:05.48 --> 01:13:09.48 And they had to kind of improvise.
01:13:09.48 --> 01:13:10.48 Improvise.
01:13:10.48 --> 01:13:14.48 And their maintenance, they were very proud of their maintenance crews.
01:13:14.48 --> 01:13:17.48 Because their maintenance crews would keep those aircraft running.
01:13:17.48 --> 01:13:19.48 And they would do whatever they had to do.
01:13:19.48 --> 01:13:22.48 And Rob cheating steel to keep the aircraft running.
01:13:22.48 --> 01:13:25.48 They were all ready.
01:13:25.48 --> 01:13:27.48 You know, use birds that had,
01:13:27.48 --> 01:13:30.48 forget they scrimmed up the aircraft themselves from somewhere.
01:13:30.48 --> 01:13:32.48 They're kind of left over aircraft.
01:13:32.48 --> 01:13:36.48 And so that it wasn't just the pilots and the gunners.
01:13:36.48 --> 01:13:43.48 And then on top of that, these incredibly hard work and sailors in the Navy that were making those birds able to fly on a moment's notice.
01:13:43.48 --> 01:13:44.48 Absolutely.
01:13:44.48 --> 01:13:53.48 But it's a very similar relationship for the saw guys and the Kingbee pilots as it is for the seals and the sea wolf guys.
01:13:53.48 --> 01:13:54.48 Oh, they're of legend.
01:13:54.48 --> 01:13:55.48 Absolutely.
01:13:55.48 --> 01:13:56.48 Yeah.
01:13:56.48 --> 01:13:59.48 And just the similar, you know, the attitude, you know what you said,
01:13:59.48 --> 01:14:13.48 Con, or on earlier when I asked you, you know, what, what do you think about when you need to go back into a spot where two Kingbees have already shot down.
01:14:13.48 --> 01:14:14.48 It then shot down.
01:14:14.48 --> 01:14:17.48 And your response was I want to get my friends out.
01:14:17.48 --> 01:14:18.48 That's it.
01:14:18.48 --> 01:14:24.48 That's, that's the a spree to core that is just unmatched, you know, and having that relationship with.
01:14:24.48 --> 01:14:30.48 And just that that warrior brotherhood is.
01:14:30.48 --> 01:14:36.48 So there's a very human side like there's a few times that we could pull that right at last light.
01:14:36.48 --> 01:14:44.48 We go to the Kingbee pilots say, hey, come on, I'll buy you a drink and captain 10 and say, I'm going home to my family or captain two on.
01:14:44.48 --> 01:14:46.48 No, thank you, but I'm going to go home.
01:14:46.48 --> 01:14:47.48 I'll be back tomorrow.
01:14:47.48 --> 01:14:49.48 You buy me drinks tomorrow.
01:14:49.48 --> 01:14:54.48 And they come back and he had time and couldn't clubhouse have a drink before we go on an exc mission.
01:14:54.48 --> 01:14:55.48 There's just amazing.
01:14:55.48 --> 01:14:58.48 So you had this whole, yeah, that's crazy.
01:14:58.48 --> 01:14:59.48 That dichotomy.
01:14:59.48 --> 01:14:59.48 Yeah.
01:14:59.48 --> 01:15:02.48 There with their, to fly home to her family.
01:15:02.48 --> 01:15:03.48 She's.
01:15:03.48 --> 01:15:04.48 And they always came for us.
01:15:04.48 --> 01:15:07.48 They never, you know, we never had them say no for us.
01:15:07.48 --> 01:15:09.48 And they have our teams.
01:15:09.48 --> 01:15:16.48 Yeah, I know that's that's definitely something to think about because Americans, we are always fighting in someone else's country.
01:15:16.48 --> 01:15:17.48 Right?
01:15:17.48 --> 01:15:18.48 We can go home.
01:15:18.48 --> 01:15:19.48 We can go home to employment.
01:15:19.48 --> 01:15:20.48 That's it.
01:15:20.48 --> 01:15:21.48 You know, there's no family.
01:15:21.48 --> 01:15:26.48 What were you married during this time or were you, did you have kids during this time?
01:15:26.48 --> 01:15:27.48 Did you have your, your brother?
01:15:27.48 --> 01:15:33.48 Yeah, I, I'm out, I'm out in, uh, 1969.
01:15:33.48 --> 01:15:42.48 And I don't remember what, if I was a set down before it or the after it.
01:15:42.48 --> 01:15:43.48 I don't remember.
01:15:43.48 --> 01:15:45.48 I said, I said the last time.
01:15:45.48 --> 01:15:49.48 I was like, let me, let me.
01:15:49.48 --> 01:15:55.48 And you must remember, uh, you know, going on a mission, getting your aircraft shot up and then going home to your wife and saying, hi, honey, I'm home.
01:15:55.48 --> 01:15:56.48 Yeah.
01:15:56.48 --> 01:15:57.48 Mm.
01:15:57.48 --> 01:15:58.48 Yeah.
01:15:58.48 --> 01:16:03.48 Every time I, the, I was shot.
01:16:03.48 --> 01:16:12.48 But they, they, they, they, I think most of the, like many times they miss me.
01:16:12.48 --> 01:16:16.48 Yeah.
01:16:16.48 --> 01:16:19.48 One time, I feel back from, uh, hair side, back to Kwang Shih.
01:16:19.48 --> 01:16:22.48 And, uh, where was the very back?
01:16:22.48 --> 01:16:30.48 And we flew all, all, all about three in the team along the hillside.
01:16:30.48 --> 01:16:39.48 And, suddenly, this, this, this, somebody, a, a long line of, I kind of, I kind of like it.
01:16:39.48 --> 01:16:43.48 Right, right, all, all of, all of my, my year.
01:16:43.48 --> 01:16:47.48 And I, I look, I look up, I look up hill.
01:16:47.48 --> 01:16:55.48 And I saw, the, a lot of NVA, you know, in the Shivua.
01:16:55.48 --> 01:16:56.48 Mm.
01:16:56.48 --> 01:16:57.48 Yeah.
01:16:57.48 --> 01:17:03.48 The front lines, the sheet, the second line, the knee and the third line, the stand.
01:17:03.48 --> 01:17:04.48 Just like that.
01:17:04.48 --> 01:17:06.48 And they were on the hill.
01:17:06.48 --> 01:17:08.48 And they're shooting at me.
01:17:08.48 --> 01:17:09.48 Wow.
01:17:09.48 --> 01:17:14.48 And, uh, and I, I, I told my Kusi.
01:17:14.48 --> 01:17:17.48 Shoot the back shoot back shoot like that.
01:17:17.48 --> 01:17:23.48 And I saw the, uh, trigger out, you know, the, you know, the round, the, the, the, the whole,
01:17:23.48 --> 01:17:27.48 the, the, the, uh, in front of the front line of them.
01:17:27.48 --> 01:17:30.48 I don't know, if they, if they, they hit the,
01:17:30.48 --> 01:17:31.48 I know them or not.
01:17:31.48 --> 01:17:35.48 But because I was the last one in the fry and then time.
01:17:35.48 --> 01:17:46.08 And so I just get primed, wait to pointy, and wait to pointy, I count, I found 49 holes.
01:17:46.08 --> 01:17:51.04 He's flying from K-Son where we had F-LB-3 who had pick-up teams on launch for targets from
01:17:51.04 --> 01:17:52.04 K-Son.
01:17:52.04 --> 01:17:57.36 And of course when you flew in the K-Son, this is during the offensive.
01:17:57.36 --> 01:17:58.68 So you know that was it.
01:17:58.68 --> 01:18:04.000 So he flies from that hot zone flying to Kwong Tree, which is, quote, a secure base in
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:11.000 route, there's three lines of VNVA just practicing target, hit them 49 times.
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.000 Yeah, 49 rounds.
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000 What happened the last time you got shot down?
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:33.000 The last time because shot down was in Budapest, north of Banyatwai.
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:48.000 And I, in so-so team at K-Son, when I K-Son, when you're in service for a long time,
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000 in K-Son, you have some feeling.
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000 I go to say six feeling.
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000 And I feel something wrong on the ground.
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:05.000 Yeah, now in the original example, so I'm from 1500 feet, I go down to check it.
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000 I had about 500 feet, they sat the suit at me.
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000 And this is this when you're trying to extract them or is this during the insert?
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000 I'm not going to fall.
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000 He's coming back from.
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000 Okay, so after you drop them off, you're halfway home and you decide you're going to go look
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000 on the ground.
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000 Yeah.
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000 And you start getting shot.
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000 Yeah.
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000 And I got mad.
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.000 I said, I'm going to extract fire and I skipped the line of fire.
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:43.000 And I said, man, I said, this is my land and I take care of all of my
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000 you could get your dad to suit and me.
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:53.000 So I come back and suit and I got hit again and the shot for cut fire.
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:58.000 They're around hit the fuel tank and then the fuel ignites.
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000 And the fire comes from the fuel tank into the cabin.
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.000 He's at 500 feet trying to keep the air,
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:12.000 create a stable to land while on fire.
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000 And I was on top of the frame.
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000 The frames come from the camera from the cabin to the cockpit.
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:30.000 And if I land right or right or the subway around there,
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:37.000 it would be okay, but I don't want it to be a cut.
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000 So I could find it like a two-wheel.
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000 So your planes on your helicopter is on fire.
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000 You could cry.
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000 You could land.
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000 But you don't want to get caught.
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000 No.
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000 Because that's going to be hard.
01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:01.000 And I tried to get back to Buddha and the frame took the frame keep burning.
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:11.000 And one time it was so hot that I left all of the control.
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000 It's quite a good and cycle.
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000 I left it.
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000 I keep my hand in my chest.
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000 When I left the cycle,
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000 then the job started to dive down.
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000 And I saw the round coming up.
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000 And I just tell the thing in my head,
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000 and his arm is over.
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000 But when it comes close to the three-top,
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000 the instinct of survival,
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000 pushed me to grab the cycle and pull back.
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000 And the job was diving down.
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000 And it's just literally when I pulled the cycle back so hard.
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000 And it came up.
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000 I thought that the men wrote the wood to mouth, but he needed.
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000 And I saw it.
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000 And I left it.
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000 And the job was diving again.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:20.000 So it's like a scene line in this guy.
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:28.000 And finally I make a glass landing in the open area.
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.000 So the handles were so hot that you couldn't hold onto them.
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000 But then at the last minute, survival instinct,
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000 you knew what you had to do in order to get some kind of a landing.
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000 So you just grabbed those.
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000 And when I saw the LZ,
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000 I was flying at the 80, 80, not a combine.
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000 And it was 90, not a combine.
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000 And I moved this cycle to the right,
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000 and pushed the right pedal all the way down.
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000 And so the job at the 90, not a combine.
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000 But 360 degree.
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000 So quick, I thought the key, the tail boom came off.
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000 But he didn't.
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000 And it started to sail around.
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000 And I touched it down very smooth.
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000 And it still runs as still running.
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000 So he did three and on the wheel came off.
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000 And the blade came off.
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.000 And when he stole, I grabbed the seatbelt lock.
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000 And I pulled it.
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000 But in September, I kept pulling.
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000 My finger opened it.
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000 And for three times, I used my left hand.
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000 I left elbow to hit the buckle.
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000 And the legs, the lock.
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000 And I grabbed the handle of the window.
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000 Because when I make the cross, it ran.
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000 And the window ran forward.
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000 And then forward, move forward and close it.
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000 So I grabbed the handle of the window.
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000 Pull it back.
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000 But it happened.
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000 I liked it.
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000 I just sit down.
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000 I grabbed it.
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000 But the finger opened.
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000 But couldn't hold the handle.
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000 Because the skin was burning.
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000 So I used my shoulder to hit the window.
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000 And abruptly, the window out.
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000 I just went down.
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:37.000 And so from the down, the arm of the material was came off.
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000 Or was burned out.
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000 I sat the zipper.
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000 And the little part was still burning.
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000 And when I rolled down on the grass, the wet grass.
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000 And to put it off.
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:58.000 And after it was off, I couldn't stand up.
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000 And my crew chips ran by and grabbed me up.
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000 And then we did the guide me to the rescue shop.
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000 You know, my three, number three came there.
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000 So then you get on the number three kingby.
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000 They get you out of there.
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000 And obviously you go straight to the hospital.
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.000 They brought me back to the medical area of the cop in the hospital.
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:40.000 And I stayed there until 11 am to next morning.
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.000 One kingby pilot, one kingby pilot from Denny,
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:56.000 three of me, with the omega-nabrize, abruptly to a third few years ago.
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000 And that's where I stayed for eight months.
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000 And what was that process like those next eight months?
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:13.000 Oh, they, uh, amputating my hand and making sheets of thin clay on my life.
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000 Because my life, uh, when I was in the hospital.
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000 And the day the doctor, doctor Smith, he amputated my hand.
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000 I asked him how about my life.
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000 He said that he didn't know until after the, after the operation.
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000 Did they amputate both your hands at the same time?
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000 Yes.
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000 And then what was the, what was the plan from there?
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000 What happened after that?
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000 After that I do back and four or three, before eight months.
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000 No, the treatment, the medical treatment, about four or five months.
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000 But after that I do make the form of two years with two years.
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000 For the doctor to check it.
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:14.000 And after that, after all the treatment, the surgery back to the, with Luis Hospital.
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000 And at some point, I know you had a brother that was a, a, he won pilot, right?
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000 He's, a, he won pilot.
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000 And what happened with him?
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000 He was on the, uh, a nine to five months.
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000 And it was missing.
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000 Yes, all right, we know.
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000 And 95 misses were across the fence also, right?
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000 No.
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000 No.
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:45.000 He was missing about about 30 kilometers north of, uh, not what they need.
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000 Ten, both in ten.
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.000 And then what was it like when the, when the war started to kind of wind down for, you know,
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000 America leaving and the communist are going to take over.
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000 What was that, what was that like for you?
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:17.000 Um, um, at the end of, uh, of April, April, April, 1995.
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.000 Yeah.
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:25.000 One was going to came to a pilot team to say to see me and, he, he, he was my, co-fi.
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000 This is an April of 1995.
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.000 Oh, 1975.
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000 Oh, 1975.
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000 Okay.
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000 Yeah.
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:35.000 Got it.
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:40.000 And, uh, he asked me, uh, what we are going to do?
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000 And I say, I really don't know what to do now.
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000 Is everything myself?
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:53.000 Did you, I mean, obviously, did you feel like the, when the communist took over that you were just
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000 doomed because clearly you were a veteran that had fought for South Vietnam.
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.000 It seems like you, you, you, you must have felt like you would be doomed if they
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000 completed the take over a Vietnam.
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000 No, I don't say so.
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000 No.
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.000 The, uh, the thing is that we, we were a desperate, because we lost the war.
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:25.000 There's nothing.
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:38.000 And, uh, on the, uh, let's see, 30, uh, April, 30, 1975.
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000 I was on board over one of the ship.
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.000 I still remember the, uh, the sea challenges.
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000 And, uh, when I heard the, uh, it was off, uh, of Wukongtong.
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000 So you were on an American ship?
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000 I don't know which is.
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000 The ship is in the country.
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000 Yeah, sea challenges.
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:05.000 And, uh, when I heard the, uh, announcement of a surrender from Zeno Loming,
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.000 oh, my, uh, my tears just came out.
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000 And I want to do them over the war.
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:22.000 And, uh, when I look back and I see my toolkit, and he's told me.
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000 He's told me from the B.L.
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000 So then what happened?
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000 I mean, now you've got your two kids, your, your, your,
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000 In Vietnam, the South is surrendered.
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000 What, what, what happened then?
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:45.000 And we go back to, uh, go back home and then wait for what happened.
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:51.000 And, um, in, uh,
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000 Surah, yeah, Surah is six.
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000 I, I, I, I, I, 75.
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.000 I was in, uh, yeah, they put me in the, uh, radio station camp.
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000 In a re-education camp.
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000 Yeah.
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000 What was that experience like?
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000 Yes.
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000 This is just talked about, uh,
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000 propaganda, uh, propaganda, uh,
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.000 and the thing is that the people who, they, they,
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000 they want to, they want us to go to class every day.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000 And we have to go to class every day as they skip talk,
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000 but they guy who tell a total, total,
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000 this is the level of normalized.
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000 Oh, my God.
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.000 This is likely, maybe, well, the class is already great to me.
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000 So you're being re-educated by a third grade.
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000 Yeah, right.
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000 And they keep, and all of them talking the same way.
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000 Mm-hmm.
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000 This is like the machine.
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000 It's just indoctrination.
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000 Yeah, indoctrination.
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000 Yeah.
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000 How long did, and how long were you at the re-education camp for?
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000 I was there for, um, uh,
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.000 zoolite, I don't know, from, uh, zool, to, uh, August.
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000 And then how did you get out of the re-education camp?
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000 Well, one time I was, uh, doing out with my, uh,
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.000 the other prisoners to, uh, create up as a, uh, the camp.
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000 And I was pulling the, uh, bubble-wide with them.
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.000 And, uh, one of the, uh, one of the guys they, uh,
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000 at the, uh, and they told me that, uh,
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000 you keep, uh, um, okay.
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000 And we have the inspection team, um, from Saigon to Camsey.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000 Hm-hmm.
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000 Mm-hmm.
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000 And, uh, when I, I saw that, uh, I hear that.
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000 I, I don't know, I, I don't know.
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000 I don't know, I don't, I don't, I, I didn't, uh,

01:41:58.36 --> 01:42:03.16 70 so you are facing either you get either your son escapes or your son is going to have to
01:42:03.16 --> 01:42:08.84 actually serve in the NBA who you had fought against for however long six years right
01:42:08.84 --> 01:42:16.04 and after my son I have a
01:42:16.04 --> 01:42:23.56 a mask and I brought my my daughters to escape another two times I got caught too
01:42:25.96 --> 01:42:34.04 and was it punishment as severe the second two times oh the second time he said it was okay
01:42:34.04 --> 01:42:41.48 but after we we can get out of a couple months after we pay about a point six a point seven
01:42:42.44 --> 01:42:51.16 how was it you go where do you find gold oh luckily that my my my my my sister
01:42:52.20 --> 01:42:59.56 my who passed away the early this year he sent money to help my mom
01:42:59.56 --> 01:43:07.08 where was your sister I sister you find she was in France so she was able to somehow send
01:43:07.08 --> 01:43:15.72 money to your mom she didn't send money she sent medicine medicine and I sell it I
01:43:15.72 --> 01:43:21.96 said okay you were not having this there's no no medicine you get down and during that time
01:43:21.96 --> 01:43:29.16 to your father was killed right my final lie in 63 63 63
01:43:29.16 --> 01:43:35.72 okay sorry yeah I was I was the F was the day you joined the Air Force yeah but
01:43:35.72 --> 01:43:39.16 you're by the way my father that my father was away that day
01:43:42.52 --> 01:43:46.76 so how did you finally how did you finally get out of Vietnam and get to America
01:43:46.76 --> 01:44:00.52 oh I see in 88 then I heard that the H.O. program I'm not a qualified project
01:44:00.52 --> 01:44:06.04 that program you say H.O. H.O. yeah humanitarian organization currently passed in
01:44:06.04 --> 01:44:14.28 yeah and it's it's helping the people who was in who was in service or who was in prison
01:44:14.28 --> 01:44:20.76 in the company's prison for one and two years can come up I'd like to come here
01:44:22.04 --> 01:44:28.28 and how did you not qualify for that because at the total time I spent
01:44:28.28 --> 01:44:32.28 prison it's only two and half year well see need to dispense more time and
01:44:32.28 --> 01:44:37.96 prison you can you imagine that after all the service could have been
01:44:37.96 --> 01:44:46.04 and so I thought that maybe I would have I might be living Vietnam forever
01:44:46.92 --> 01:44:55.40 so I prepare for my what I'm I plan to what I'm going to do to lead
01:44:56.76 --> 01:45:00.04 but at that time the
01:45:00.04 --> 01:45:04.92 side of it means the
01:45:06.36 --> 01:45:08.92 first association is the
01:45:09.48 --> 01:45:13.88 the mayor of Masuoka he was the
01:45:15.32 --> 01:45:20.60 Air Force reticulano so this is an American Air Force retired in Masuoka
01:45:20.60 --> 01:45:23.56 and he was working with the San Jose
01:45:23.56 --> 01:45:32.20 he's now Vietnamese Air Force Association yeah and he the
01:45:32.20 --> 01:45:39.16 South Vietnamese Air Force Association asked me to help me I seem to help me and
01:45:41.24 --> 01:45:48.84 he went to Vietnam and South Vietnam and I he asked me to bring on my paper that I had
01:45:48.84 --> 01:45:55.64 I brought to him and when he saw the DFC and he said
01:45:56.68 --> 01:46:00.76 when he saw the what the DFC no the FC this thing was right close
01:46:01.96 --> 01:46:06.36 what's that American award all the DSC got it got it got it
01:46:06.36 --> 01:46:11.16 or the DSF foreign cars got it okay yeah yeah I know I got it I I misunderstood
01:46:11.16 --> 01:46:16.20 okay so he saw that he saw that and but he didn't say anything but later on he said that
01:46:16.20 --> 01:46:23.16 he told me that he didn't believe it because usually the DFC supposed to give
01:46:23.16 --> 01:46:29.24 to a baby award to the American college so after he looked all kind of
01:46:29.24 --> 01:46:35.32 a on my paper and he said that he would try and represent but he's not guaranteed
01:46:36.12 --> 01:46:38.12 under percent
01:46:38.12 --> 01:46:51.40 and he came back to state and he called one of the guy who worked in the
01:46:51.40 --> 01:47:00.36 archive, National Archives and the that guy was he was working with him in the military
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:07.24 when he was cornered and the guy was then second lit
01:47:07.24 --> 01:47:15.08 down on the corner second lit in the corner okay like a lieutenant corner yeah a little
01:47:15.08 --> 01:47:26.04 the corner and so I had and they found the DFC and the FC and the FR are the
01:47:26.04 --> 01:47:38.68 writer and the paper and that the FC and they managed to
01:47:38.68 --> 01:47:50.04 the National Inquiry the magazine was quite bad yeah they they found the
01:47:50.04 --> 01:48:00.52 before I did I I escaped okay and one pilot came to see me
01:48:00.52 --> 01:48:10.68 he's a so-liner and he's a squad commander he's a molyson and they came
01:48:10.68 --> 01:48:16.92 the National Inquiry but they everything that they took the camera to all year to see me
01:48:16.92 --> 01:48:23.72 wow and so then they set up that program to get you back here so what year did you finally get back
01:48:25.08 --> 01:48:31.80 or what did you get to America? let's see I came here in 1994 1994 yeah
01:48:31.80 --> 01:48:39.000 right in Nashville what family did you leave back in Vietnam? when I left Vietnam my mom still
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:52.04 I told my nephew the descendant of my my missing more brother to take care of to come over
01:48:52.04 --> 01:49:00.44 I leave it so I can go and I came here in I left Vietnam
01:49:00.44 --> 01:49:17.80 on January 10, 1994 and I came at least 12 years here to on then in 2015, 1994 and then
01:49:17.80 --> 01:49:21.40 what happened? did you have any family here did you know anybody?
01:49:21.40 --> 01:49:30.44 no I first I leave the same house with the the chip of the the south of the video for such a season
01:49:30.44 --> 01:49:40.44 there okay yeah I leave it for six months after that I moved out and then did you get a job? what did you
01:49:40.44 --> 01:49:46.28 do? no yeah at that time my my my my son and my brother and my son and my daughter work
01:49:46.28 --> 01:49:52.52 at this apartment okay yeah and when you made it out so you had your son and your daughter with you when
01:49:52.52 --> 01:49:59.16 you made it out my my my son came here well that's right so he was already here that's right
01:49:59.16 --> 01:50:07.48 but when I came here in 1994 my daughter came with me got it yeah so your son and your
01:50:07.48 --> 01:50:13.40 daughter were here or your son was already here your daughter came with you and now they're working
01:50:13.40 --> 01:50:20.04 and started to figure out life in America how big of a shock was that to you? I did the
01:50:20.04 --> 01:50:30.60 last time I was I was sad because they hope I do nothing waiting for the what is going to happen
01:50:30.60 --> 01:50:38.76 because at that time they were trying to catch a shield and see for me so as I can
01:50:38.76 --> 01:50:46.60 I started so they can keep me here and it's a lot of a petition at that time I
01:50:46.60 --> 01:50:51.24 could not even have a head as with a little of a petition
01:50:51.24 --> 01:51:04.12 you know right and in the sixth the 1996 I got a citizen
01:51:04.12 --> 01:51:10.52 in the United States you got your citizenship here in America. She's then you went to
01:51:10.52 --> 01:51:18.52 set the clear fire department yeah I look for that I don't know after that I I go to school
01:51:18.52 --> 01:51:24.20 for the accounting class and after one year I got the
01:51:24.20 --> 01:51:33.96 is up in the Santa Clara fire department for almost three years and then I ran out of
01:51:33.96 --> 01:51:43.24 the budgets and I was there and I then brought for six months and again the others are up in the
01:51:43.24 --> 01:51:49.16 I-R-I-S. Oh you worked for the IRS? Yeah. Okay well suppose we'll have to figure that out. Yeah
01:51:49.16 --> 01:51:57.72 he's one of them he goes from a good guy a hero to the IRS and how long were you at the IRS for
01:51:57.72 --> 01:52:07.08 a form of 2000 to 2013. Totally news and that was it after that you retired? Yeah
01:52:07.88 --> 01:52:16.36 and what are you doing now? Sleep and watch TV. No more prairie fire emergencies but
01:52:16.36 --> 01:52:25.16 at first I was it was really morning I tried to look for the part-time job but I couldn't
01:52:27.32 --> 01:52:35.56 put the part-time job so then you just had it you just hear retirement now. You look for a
01:52:35.56 --> 01:52:41.32 part-time job that wasn't anything. I don't care what I want to know what's anything
01:52:41.32 --> 01:52:49.16 this is maybe about four hours six hours a day. You're ready to work? Yeah.
01:52:49.88 --> 01:52:58.44 Ready to work. Sick of watching TV. And you're up in this area here in the San Jose area.
01:52:58.44 --> 01:53:02.36 Yeah, San Jose. She's the day I came here. Okay because we might be able to find a job for you.
01:53:02.36 --> 01:53:07.16 Somebody probably looking for someone. Got it. Yeah. What the work on that? Yeah. Yeah.
01:53:07.16 --> 01:53:13.24 Oh, tilt. Did I miss anything? I mean well let me rephrase that. I know we missed. I know there's
01:53:13.24 --> 01:53:17.56 all kinds of stories. Is there anything else that you want to bring up? No I think those are the
01:53:17.56 --> 01:53:23.72 major stories. Just the documented ones. Indeed. Because that's one thing I mean when you talk
01:53:23.72 --> 01:53:29.88 when we talk when we broke down your 3000 combat flight hours. I mean we could probably we
01:53:29.88 --> 01:53:35.96 you could talk for you know 3000 hours explaining what happened on all those missions. So
01:53:35.96 --> 01:53:43.24 I mean just unbelievable that you were able to get through all that crazy.
01:53:44.04 --> 01:53:52.04 On my friend he told me that I they couldn't believe that I still live with the due to date.
01:53:52.76 --> 01:54:01.80 For sure. For sure. For sure. So tell anything else though. No I we covered the major points
01:54:01.80 --> 01:54:08.36 there and you know just like that one time with the Marines need help here he comes he just went
01:54:08.36 --> 01:54:16.12 there under fire and so many times his kingbees got shot up. I mean 40 50 rounds of the holes
01:54:16.12 --> 01:54:24.68 of this. Just amazing stories and the men were just so many of our saw guys that are live today.
01:54:25.48 --> 01:54:31.32 Thanks to the kingbeepiles period and of course the other avidus but in our case we had that
01:54:31.32 --> 01:54:36.84 direct relationship with them. There were primary assets they put us in they always came to pull
01:54:36.84 --> 01:54:42.20 us out. The pat walk is thing you let off with just a classic moment just captured the essence
01:54:42.20 --> 01:54:49.08 of that underground intense firefight and here comes the kingbee. Not only did you come he
01:54:49.08 --> 01:54:52.44 settles into a bomb career so you can get on the hill up there and go home.
01:54:52.44 --> 01:55:05.24 On anything else you want to add? Well I'll tell you what it's just been an honor to talk to you
01:55:05.24 --> 01:55:12.84 and thank you so much for coming on and more important thank you for your service and your sacrifice.
01:55:12.84 --> 01:55:19.56 It's we won't forget it and you took so many risks. You took so many risks and you paid
01:55:19.56 --> 01:55:25.48 such a price in order to save your comrades and your brother's norms and to be there for the
01:55:25.48 --> 01:55:32.12 guys on the ground and we appreciate that and we appreciate the fact that you stood the line
01:55:32.12 --> 01:55:38.04 to defend freedom in the world. So thank you. And during the secret war the kingbees were
01:55:39.08 --> 01:55:45.88 another secret that nobody knew about. And so I thank you for doing this to get the story about
01:55:45.88 --> 01:55:53.32 our heroic on any other kingbee pilots. Unfortunately many of whom we've lost. We buried captain
01:55:53.32 --> 01:56:01.32 two on two months ago three months ago and our secret war had its secrets and one of the gems
01:56:01.32 --> 01:56:06.68 one of the great assets were our kingbees and we slew to every day and their brothers and arms.
01:56:06.68 --> 01:56:10.60 So thank you for doing that, Jaka. It's an honor. We appreciate it. Thank you.
01:56:10.60 --> 01:56:22.36 Thank you. And with that tilt and on have left the building and once again we are left with an
01:56:22.36 --> 01:56:28.12 example of what human beings can do, what human beings can face, what human beings can overcome.
01:56:28.12 --> 01:56:39.000 Pretty amazing. Pretty humbling. Yeah. Yeah.
01:56:45.40 --> 01:56:53.64 Feel like we can do more. Yeah. I mean that's pretty much the general kind of overall consensus
01:56:53.64 --> 01:56:58.04 as I feel like we can do more. Yeah. Feel like we need to do more. Feel like I need to do more.
01:56:58.04 --> 01:57:03.40 Anyways, I don't want to bring you over. Yeah. Like the group me and your team and team.
01:57:04.28 --> 01:57:08.52 Process of trying to do more. Because I think sometimes I think you feel like maybe you're good
01:57:08.52 --> 01:57:13.96 with what you're doing. Sure. Well, yeah. I don't know. Maybe maybe not. But yes, I think so. So
01:57:13.96 --> 01:57:21.72 you know, he mentioned and we all know that he lost both his hands and then later on join the
01:57:21.72 --> 01:57:26.76 fire department. So he was in the count and met the fire department. But yes, he's in the fire department
01:57:26.76 --> 01:57:33.16 with no hands. Yeah. And by the way, I mean this is he lost his hands, both hands. And I asked him
01:57:33.16 --> 01:57:41.80 about it. He's like, oh yeah, well then I went to. He was no like there was no hesitation in carrying
01:57:41.80 --> 01:57:45.56 on with what he was going to do. He's just going to whatever I guess he's going to get hooks and he's
01:57:45.56 --> 01:57:52.92 going to carry on. That's what he's doing. And then at the end, which kind of gives you an insight
01:57:52.92 --> 01:57:58.52 to like how he's thinking where he's like, yeah, I'm like retired and I kind of just made a joke like
01:57:58.52 --> 01:58:02.92 I just sleep and watch TV and he's like, man, I'm kind of looking for a part that I'm job like
01:58:02.92 --> 01:58:07.48 you've got to go do some stuff. You know what I was thinking about? If somebody told you a story
01:58:07.80 --> 01:58:11.88 where they said, listen, here's what's going on. I was in a helicopter. I was flying the helicopter
01:58:11.88 --> 01:58:19.80 and the controls of the helicopter were burning and they were on fire. But and I couldn't hold on
01:58:19.80 --> 01:58:25.16 to him. So I just let him go. And then right as we were about to crash, I just grabbed onto him and
01:58:25.16 --> 01:58:30.52 I steered the plane, I just steered the aircraft, the helicopter and I got it to land and we lived.
01:58:31.32 --> 01:58:37.40 But those those controls were so hot. It was crazy. Okay. So if you heard that,
01:58:37.40 --> 01:58:44.12 you would think one level of the word hot, right? And there's no way that the level of hot that
01:58:44.12 --> 01:58:51.000 could be explained to you is so hot that you lose both of your hands from voluntarily grabbing the controls.
01:58:51.64 --> 01:58:55.96 Like that does. And then as you're trying to get your seat belt off your hands or just ripping apart,
01:58:55.96 --> 01:59:04.04 falling apart. Yeah. So yeah, and that opening, that opening that I read from on the ground with the
01:59:04.04 --> 01:59:09.72 book on the ground by John Stracker Meyer, it's just, it's crazy to think, you know, you, oh,
01:59:09.72 --> 01:59:16.04 guess what? There's going to be two dangerous. So I'm not going to take a co-pilot or a crew chief.
01:59:16.04 --> 01:59:23.64 All's I'm going to bring is a door gunner, me. That's it. That's what we're doing. That's another
01:59:23.64 --> 01:59:30.20 level. Yeah. By the way, you're sitting on a base like warm, whatever. I don't know, cool. Maybe
01:59:30.20 --> 01:59:36.52 you're an AC. You just had a piece of chicken or something. Like life is pretty good, right?
01:59:37.48 --> 01:59:41.48 And I'm to mention these guys in Vietnam, they're like have to go home at night, like till we'll
01:59:41.48 --> 01:59:48.20 say, hey, oh, cool. I'm going to go home now. Yeah. Because I think when I was on deployment,
01:59:48.20 --> 01:59:52.36 I just put all that family stuff out of my brain. Yeah. I wasn't thinking about my wife. Yeah.
01:59:52.36 --> 01:59:59.08 I was in just the deployment mode. I think it'll be really hard to go. Oh, deployment mode. Well,
02:00:00.52 --> 02:00:07.48 singing ballet recital with the child. Yeah. You know, they say, hey, don't bring your work home or what,
02:00:07.48 --> 02:00:11.000 you know, what's that saying? Yeah. Right. That's not the level right there. It's another level.
02:00:12.28 --> 02:00:19.40 Check. So yes, we can do more. So yeah. All right. Well, keep yourself. Keep us. We're keeping
02:00:19.40 --> 02:00:26.68 ourselves in the game. We're all getting older. We're not getting younger. But that way. Maybe some
02:00:26.68 --> 02:00:33.32 of us are okay. Okay. So you're just going back in time. We've added video. There's this thing you
02:00:33.32 --> 02:00:40.12 can do that freezes the frame. Right. So that's kind of what you you you you feel that you're doing.
02:00:40.12 --> 02:00:45.80 Freezes the frame. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Well, when you're working out anyway, you need supplementation.
02:00:45.80 --> 02:00:52.52 That's undeniable. I guess you could deny it if you wanted to nonetheless supplementate that be a mistake.
02:00:52.52 --> 02:00:58.04 I think you'd be a mistake, yes, sir. So anyway, joc was supplement is called jockel fuel. So these
02:00:58.04 --> 02:01:03.16 supplements include, but not limited to joint warfare for your joints, super cruel oil. Also for your joints.
02:01:03.16 --> 02:01:11.88 General health. Some omega 3's in there. These are important. What I'm saying. Also discipline,
02:01:11.88 --> 02:01:17.80 discipline, go. Three versions. Now three versions of the discipline powder. Do you drink powder every
02:01:17.80 --> 02:01:22.20 day in the morning? Kind of yes. Matter of fact yes. And so I was thinking about this. So in the morning,
02:01:22.20 --> 02:01:28.84 I drink coffee. Am I coffee drink? I don't know. Maybe maybe not. I don't drink coffee every single
02:01:28.84 --> 02:01:35.32 morning. But that's like as far as morning routines go. Coffee's not part of your routine. I know
02:01:35.32 --> 02:01:39.32 that. Definitely not part of my routine. But is the discipline? Could you get a workout, right? So you take the
02:01:39.32 --> 02:01:45.32 discipline every morning before the workout? No. I take it before I work work. After the workout.
02:01:45.32 --> 02:01:49.40 Yeah, when I wake up in the morning, I don't drink anything. I just drink water. Water, but go. Yeah,
02:01:49.40 --> 02:01:53.72 that's a good one. All right, interesting. That is interesting. I just don't know. Now I'm going to
02:01:53.72 --> 02:02:01.000 when I'm going to the juts on the way there on drinking discipline for your troops. I'll dare to
02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:09.80 three scams actually. Well, sometimes actually four. There you go. But nonetheless, and then, um, yes.
02:02:09.80 --> 02:02:15.08 So there is part of version. Also capsule version. Cool. That's when you're on the go. And then the
02:02:15.88 --> 02:02:26.52 energy drink healthy energy drink version. See, this is a good one. So in this far as energy drinks go,
02:02:26.52 --> 02:02:33.64 like we say, you can have an energy drink, but if even saying energy drink kind of brings along
02:02:33.64 --> 02:02:40.76 the stigma of the energy drink. Definitely discipline. Go. Energy drink RTD does not have that stigma.
02:02:40.76 --> 02:02:47.08 Because it is factually healthy. Truth. Truth. True. Anyway, sometimes you look at me, you want me to
02:02:47.64 --> 02:02:52.84 give you backup. No, on your statement. No. And I just got that look, then you were made a complete
02:02:52.84 --> 02:02:58.60 talk. Right. So you're nothing else from me to add. Yes, sir. No, it's good for you. A lot of times
02:02:58.60 --> 02:03:05.88 I look at you because like, sometimes you'll have this look like, oh, let me, like, you remember
02:03:05.88 --> 02:03:09.64 something. Yeah, like you want to, you know, and I just want to give you that opportunity. Oh, thank
02:03:09.64 --> 02:03:14.28 you. Thank you. I always have a nice, thank you for the opportunity. Just say sometimes. Sometimes
02:03:14.28 --> 02:03:20.68 you say some good stuff. Anyway, yeah. Also, Mark, these are in the form protein, protein in the form
02:03:20.68 --> 02:03:25.48 to dessert. Six and one, half dozen the other. Yes, sir. Either way, we do know this. We're getting
02:03:25.48 --> 02:03:30.84 something that's tasty and good for us. Good for us. And so you get to essentially just say it's good.
02:03:30.84 --> 02:03:37.32 It's good because that covers all bases. Good for you. Good tasting. It depends on what kind of
02:03:37.32 --> 02:03:42.28 good, because there's a lot of kinds of good and for good various things. You've been doing a lot of
02:03:42.28 --> 02:03:47.64 work a lot of lawyer activity with me lately about well, it depends on what you mean by. Yeah,
02:03:47.64 --> 02:03:52.52 because it's interesting. Yeah, because you can't just blanket statement a lot of stuff. Like,
02:03:53.16 --> 02:03:57.72 okay, so my daughter asked me what's your favorite color? So I'm like, all right, well, it kind of
02:03:57.72 --> 02:04:04.76 depends. Like, let's say black was my favorite color. But the same time, like, I don't necessarily
02:04:04.76 --> 02:04:08.60 want everything to be black. Some things I want to be red. Like, I don't want to eat a black
02:04:08.60 --> 02:04:15.24 strawberry. I'll tell you that. Okay. You see what I'm saying, though. A lot of these questions.
02:04:15.24 --> 02:04:20.04 Okay. Like I said, you're doing a lot of these questions. Demand a little bit of a
02:04:20.04 --> 02:04:25.72 little camera. Next question. Well, you'd want to eat a camel orange. Yes. You do want to. If
02:04:25.72 --> 02:04:30.52 there was such a thing, if you get an orange that was camel, we just called it a camel. It said
02:04:30.52 --> 02:04:38.04 an orange. All right. Well, I just think of like, what if my wife's face was camel? I'm not
02:04:38.04 --> 02:04:43.24 again. That wouldn't be too bad either. All right. Well, whatever. All right. Cool. I'll simply
02:04:43.24 --> 02:04:50.92 find my answers. How about that? Cool. Cool. Anyway. All these things. Jockel, few available in various
02:04:50.92 --> 02:04:57.16 locations, including origimayn.com. Yes. Final min shot. Absolutely. And as far as discipline, go

02:05:41.88 --> 02:05:46.52 people from Pennsylvania, people from Jersey, people from Virginia are like, we need it up here. And
02:05:46.52 --> 02:05:55.24 this wall. Yes. Yeah. I did see it. Just in. Probe in there for sure. Yes. Good. Okay. Back to

02:06:04.44 --> 02:06:09.80 Yeah. And you might think to yourself, oh, oh, American made jeans, right? Okay. I know what
02:06:09.80 --> 02:06:15.000 that's going to be. That's going to be a $350 pair of jeans. That's what you might be thinking
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:20.28 that. Potent. You're thinking wrong. Actually, you're thinking wrong. Get yourself a couple of
02:06:20.28 --> 02:06:27.72 pair of origin jeans. And listen, they're not as cheap as we want them to be right now. But as we grow,
02:06:27.72 --> 02:06:37.08 as we scale, we will be able to get the price down even more. But join the, join the club of
02:06:38.20 --> 02:06:46.04 supporting America. That's true. Also boots like I said, also talk with the store. It's called
02:06:46.04 --> 02:06:51.08 Jocquistor. It's speaking of clubs. We have another club. It's not really a club. It's just a
02:06:51.08 --> 02:06:57.56 subscription. Yeah, the club. I mean, really, anyway, it's a subscription-based t-shirt scenario.
02:06:57.56 --> 02:07:03.88 I like that way better than club. I think club is something that you do. Unless you're in a
02:07:03.88 --> 02:07:10.04 motorcycle gang club. Yeah. Then that's one. That's like one. Also it depends. Oh,
02:07:10.04 --> 02:07:16.12 that's just sort of a real name. Right. But it depends on the word. What you mean by club. Why are you
02:07:16.12 --> 02:07:21.08 being a lawyer? Because you're over here. You know, you see what I'm saying. Anyway, yes,
02:07:21.08 --> 02:07:25.72 club subscription-based t-shirt. It's situation. Which you are wearing one today. Is this the
02:07:25.72 --> 02:07:31.08 initial rule? Launch mode? It's the one of the ones. I would say that one's dope. Yeah. And you know,
02:07:31.08 --> 02:07:36.12 I don't throw that. You know, it's around very often. It's in the wild. Yeah, but yes, yes, sir. I like your layers.
02:07:36.12 --> 02:07:42.28 I don't know. And yeah, you know, these t-shirt ideas, you know, they come, they go. Some sticks.
02:07:42.28 --> 02:07:47.24 I'm don't stick. But this is like an opportunity for all of us to sort of, you know, capitalize on
02:07:47.24 --> 02:07:55.08 some of the cool t-shirt ideas that just fly in from time to time. Yeah. And just like the ideas coming
02:07:55.08 --> 02:07:59.24 go, the shirts will come and go. Every month. I want to get one of these shirts. And they're gone.
02:08:00.04 --> 02:08:03.40 Anyway, talk of story.com. That's where you can jump on that. If you want, also on

02:08:29.96 --> 02:08:38.60 podcast. Also worn your kid podcast. We also have a YouTube channel where Echo gets to manifest his
02:08:38.60 --> 02:08:45.24 little video fantasy. All right, kids. You will always say that and hey, man, good. But when you think
02:08:45.24 --> 02:08:51.80 about it, YouTube channel, you're talking about enhanced videos. Videos of weed at some point
02:08:51.80 --> 02:08:57.48 started calling enhanced. Okay, maybe I made that up. But either way, they're not that many of them.
02:08:57.48 --> 02:09:02.52 They're all just like the video version of this podcast and some excerpts of this podcast. So
02:09:02.52 --> 02:09:08.52 technically, the YouTube channel is more you than anything. So you know, I'm just saying you put it on me a lot.
02:09:08.52 --> 02:09:12.76 So I'm just saying it. It's kind of both of us. I don't know. It's sort of the outlet for your
02:09:14.04 --> 02:09:19.32 stuff though. Kind of. Yeah, I guess that's kind of true. I got to see your stuff being out. You
02:09:19.32 --> 02:09:24.52 haven't read any books yet. That's true. You don't. Do you have a podcast? I guess you have this podcast.
02:09:24.52 --> 02:09:30.76 Technically, yeah, I guess. No, that's true. Because yes, if I want to express myself in any
02:09:30.76 --> 02:09:34.76 capacity to come creatively, yeah, where is it going to land? It's going to land on the YouTube
02:09:34.76 --> 02:09:41.16 channel. Like me. I'm over writing songs. I'm over playing guitar. Oh, yeah. I'm painting. I'm drawing.
02:09:41.16 --> 02:09:48.44 I'm writing books. I'm just all about video. That's your realm. Yeah, you do that. Yeah,
02:09:48.44 --> 02:09:52.28 you make a video or two every once in a while. Which is good. Which is who I do it. All
02:09:52.28 --> 02:09:58.84 of you. Oh, yeah. Check. All right. Nonetheless, yes, okay. So I understand now. I understand when
02:09:58.84 --> 02:10:04.12 you're saying it and you're correct. And I am corrected and I understand it fully and accept that.
02:10:04.12 --> 02:10:10.04 Also, psychological warfare. It's an album. You know, you're talking when you make music sometimes.
02:10:10.04 --> 02:10:14.68 You're just making albums. Yeah. There you go. So this is one of them. Anyway, it's not a music
02:10:14.68 --> 02:10:21.72 one. No, this is Jockel helping you with each track. Identify and help you overcome any of the
02:10:21.72 --> 02:10:28.28 that might that you might encounter. So that one is one of those things that's helpful, but it's 100
02:10:28.28 --> 02:10:36.12 percent effective. Sure. Yeah. Also, we have a visual form of that flip side canvas.com decode
02:10:36.12 --> 02:10:39.96 to my art making all kinds of cool stuff to hang on your wall. Got a bunch of books. The books

02:11:27.64 --> 02:11:32.92 delivery trucks are short. They're going to run out. So your package is going to be sitting in a
02:11:32.92 --> 02:11:37.24 warehouse somewhere and your kid's going to be crying. And why are they crying through reasons?
02:11:37.24 --> 02:11:41.08 Number one, they don't have war. Your kid. Number two, they don't have war. Your kid. Because
02:11:41.08 --> 02:11:49.24 if they did, they wouldn't be crying about it. They would put their emotions in check. So you might
02:11:49.24 --> 02:11:52.76 want to check that out. And also extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership.
