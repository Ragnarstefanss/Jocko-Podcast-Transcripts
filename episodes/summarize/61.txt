So, so, I come in Thursday night, I'm pulling up in my 1991 ever, like Dodge Caravan pull up and many van man and there's that car, there's more cars, nothing, so now I walk in and it's, there's people everywhere, right, it's crowded, it's crowded, it went from like 10 or 12 people in the class, now we, there's like a hundred people there, I'm serious, we had to lay out like all these different mats and everyone is quiet, no one's talking, it was, I was too old, so Hicksson's there, and he's, you know, like, in a corner, you know, just cool chill and he looks at Lamaun and he, you know, gives him like a head nod in the months, okay, we're warming up and I was like, okay, so everyone gets in the line, they start doing the old school, due to we're running in a circle, silence, like no one's saying anything, it's just silence, and so you could feel the presence of Hicks and there's a hundred people now and there's just ten times as many people and everyone's quiet, everyone's serious and then, you know, we get done with like a 20 minute warm-up of stretchy and exercise, this is just getting after it my self it's like we're like a little group of like this is a good it's a good thing you know get everybody out of bed and stop eating donuts and you get a good thing there it is if you want some jocca white tea it's in stock it's on Amazon if you're in America get it on Amazon if you're in a foreign country go to eBay pro-resourcing it's the official listing you can get it there you you already know what what the tea is gonna do for you you already know that you are weak you'll become strong you are stupid you're gonna become smart you are lazy you're gonna become aggressive just gonna solve all your problems you know what that's the side effects because it also just tastes good so which one's you gonna go and I'll tell you what right now I don't we are assessing and likely going to put jocquite in cans like an energy drink and you know the the cool thing about Hixon is he's got a personality that I would love to tell you that he's you know like a stereotypical peaceful warrior master that scenes content with where he's ended up in life and with his experiences in life but with Hixon I get the feeling that he's a guy that fighting is in his blood right and even though he's a mellow guy and he has nothing to prove to anybody I think and it kind of feels like the way I feel he likes the taste of blood you know what I mean and even though I'm kind of the same way like I feel like you know and uncle Marx says or uncle Jake says by doing everything I just said a normal kid doesn't push himself a warrior kid does a normal kid doesn't work to constantly improve himself a warrior kid does I look at all these problems you cried to me about yesterday a warrior kid wouldn't cry about those problems a warrior kid would do something about those problems and then Marx says do what do what do whatever it takes every problem you have can be overcome every one of them you can't do pull-ups you work out and get stronger until you can you don't know your times tables you study and train your mind until you know them cold you can't swim you learn how you get picked on you learn out of fight fight I asked yes fight just like anything else in the world there are techniques to fighting like learning a sport and when you know the techniques and practice them you can defend yourself from anyone you really think I could learn all that I know you can like I told you last night I had to transform myself when I got in the navy I had to get stronger I had to learn to fight I even had to learn to learn Dean it's really good because when you know I train with Dean all the time and so you know there's no one that that I roll with on a regular basis I don't roll with some really good guys but when Dean is mounted on you or when Dean is on side control on you it is insufferable it's a bad position and especially because like I'll roll with I roll with other really high level guys that aren't from our school and when I roll with them if they get a position like that they don't know exactly my every little escape Dean knows exactly knows you know all 14 of my escapes he knows them all so you're more trapped and it's the same with him when I get to position I know what he's gonna do so I assume that you're doing a good job and we're gonna continue what you're doing that's what he said when he took over so what's going on here is you got two completely different situations and the two situations are one is a guy taking over first situation a known bad situation the troops are lacking discipline they're not executing the mission and if you remember for that story they weren't even doing basic military bearing they didn't they weren't saluting the officers they just had thrown everything out the window that's the situation we got to come and you got to get firm out of the gate that's what you got to do now they got to know that they got to know that things are gonna change they got to know it's real they got to know there's a new plan so both those guys should you should instead of saying hey you know what they should do walk up and be like hey man you know what I noticed you're pretty successful financially I would like to get in the game with you a little bit and learn from you about that and the other guys should take them well you know what it looks like you're in pretty good fitness levels I would like to get in the game with that let's work together and improve ourselves and go out and kick ass and dominate are you in I mean let's do this instead what is a normal person do they do exactly what you said justify criticize cut people down instead of building them up so here we go so at this point here's what's going on at this point basically the kid mark he's like I said he doesn't know how to do he can't to any pull-ups doesn't know his time stables he's getting picked on its rule doesn't know how to swim guess what he's a ten-year-old kid in life life is hard he's realized that he's bummed out he's been sad his uncle Jake comes to live with him for the summer his uncle Jake used to be in the seal teams he's getting out so he can go to college but during the summer he's living with his sister so now when uncle Jake realizes that mark as all these issues like I said what does he say when mark freaks out and cries it says like all these issues uncle Jake says good we can solve these problems and then he says look you you know better shape and I can you can go longer less class for him just in general but the the bigger impact was that that's not something I have to worry about anymore dealing with being and when I get tired mentally you become you know what it feels like to be tired because I don't get you know what that felt like before it was hard to deal with I would say that's how it felt to me like what I'm like I'm tired I need to not be tired that's the goal now I don't care about getting tapped out yeah things just one big mystery no one big path to victory you know you know take the krill oil on it ecologically friendly harvesting of krill watch the video on it dot com on it dot com slash jockel if you want 10% off pre-workout which is total strength and performance he'll give you more strength and more performance my anecdotal shrimp tech proof by the way I I got on I had a bunch of like I said I've been working a lot I've been traveling a lot we're traveling you're getting on planes with a bunch of people that you don't know and they have all kinds of germs as do I and two people get sick and I can't be sick and do my job because I got to go talk to people and meet people and give speeches and all that stuff so when I bring them from the the water filler thing to my car I'm grabbing them both and I'm walking across the street you're too ready at four I had four but two at a time I feel too because it's two right things whatever so therefore I'm walking across street to you know not the street the parking lot to my car to put them in and I'm like this isn't even hard but they look kind of big you know I'm like this isn't even hard just like I'm not like stiff but he's not in that good shape we're out of no he smokes and whatever you know that it's easy I think a lot of people it feels like it's easy to justify wolf that guy's in bad shape so who cares I wouldn't want any of that I wouldn't want all the money you know all this stuff it seems like you just gotta justify that and you know what the other guy's saying obviously so when you get two guys well let me let me refray that when you get two guys that are evenly matched and are going at it hard they're both gonna be tired and so they're gonna want a little bit of rest so if you give them that opportunity to back off the throttle just a little bit subconsciously they're gonna do it because they think they're doing good they think that won that last round so you can see that all the time you see I mean it happened it happened with Ronda you know they're saying hey good job good job you're looking good I'm I'm with you you want to give that maybe you let out that little sigh of frustration you know like a little like something like that right just gonna do that little thing just do that let's just show in that you do got some emotions and you are invested in all that stuff you know it's like I'm not the honest truth is I'm excited about other things we'll just say that that's gross I'm all those I love all that love you got for crying about the fact that you're getting better you're getting better you're gonna know I look it's all going backwards now people are gonna hate you now don't grab talk about it exactly you're daughter draws your beautiful picture you know care about it but if it is and you got the cruel oil going that's the kind of things you can do almost like a superpower anyway if you want these amazing
