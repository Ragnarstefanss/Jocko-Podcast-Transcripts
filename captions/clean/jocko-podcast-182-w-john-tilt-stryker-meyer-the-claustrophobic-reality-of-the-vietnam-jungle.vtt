00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.48
This is Jockel Podcast number 182.

2
00:00:04.48 --> 00:00:07.28
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:09.28
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:09.28 --> 00:00:10.68
Good evening.

5
00:00:10.68 --> 00:00:13.84
The insertion was flawless.

6
00:00:13.84 --> 00:00:18.92
We were in the wood line and on our way for a general area reconnaissance.

7
00:00:18.92 --> 00:00:23.52
This time we played it by the book, moving 10 minutes, then waiting 10 minutes.

8
00:00:23.52 --> 00:00:28.60
As we moved, I swear that I'd never run an eight-man team again.

9
00:00:28.60 --> 00:00:31.12
It was too cumbersome.

10
00:00:31.12 --> 00:00:37.04
In this target, the vegetation still made me a tad on edge as it had a second canopy in some

11
00:00:37.04 --> 00:00:43.20
areas, but still gave us long lines of sight, something we weren't used to.

12
00:00:43.20 --> 00:00:48.60
As darkness approached, we looked for a good spot to R-O-N.

13
00:00:48.60 --> 00:00:52.64
With the flat terrain, finding a good R-O-N became really dicey.

14
00:00:52.64 --> 00:00:58.72
Alternatively, we'd look for high ground, dense vegetation, or an area far from any trail.

15
00:00:58.72 --> 00:01:03.66
Finally we found one, and saw a set up perimeter, set up the watch rotation, and oversaw

16
00:01:03.66 --> 00:01:07.000
the placement of extra clay more minds.

17
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.56
In one area where the vegetation was thin, bubble placed a couple of toe poppers in the

18
00:01:11.56 --> 00:01:13.20
ground.

19
00:01:13.20 --> 00:01:15.04
I couldn't sleep.

20
00:01:15.04 --> 00:01:18.76
The flat terrain played on my mind.

21
00:01:18.76 --> 00:01:22.88
Our first light, the entire team, was awake, alert, retrieving the clay more minds and preparing

22
00:01:22.88 --> 00:01:26.44
for our move out of the R-O-N.

23
00:01:26.44 --> 00:01:33.12
After night on the jungle floor, I wanted an R-N-R anywhere with firm beds, clean sheets,

24
00:01:33.12 --> 00:01:35.56
and cold drinks.

25
00:01:35.56 --> 00:01:41.28
Because I insisted on carrying the PRC-25, there was little room in my backpack, except

26
00:01:41.28 --> 00:01:43.20
for essentials.

27
00:01:43.20 --> 00:01:49.04
At night, when I slept on the ground, I did so without an air mattress or hammock.

28
00:01:49.04 --> 00:01:55.96
The sole item of comfort was an Army-issue pullover sweater that buttoned up to the neck.

29
00:01:55.96 --> 00:02:01.04
Whenever I put it on at night, I was always worried about Charlie hitting us when I was pulling

30
00:02:01.04 --> 00:02:02.84
the sweater over my head.

31
00:02:02.84 --> 00:02:09.32
It was one of the few creature comforts I allowed myself or had room for in my Rucksack.

32
00:02:09.32 --> 00:02:13.46
Shortly after first light, the green Hornets CNC aircraft flew into the edge of our

33
00:02:13.46 --> 00:02:16.96
AO for a routine commo check.

34
00:02:16.96 --> 00:02:22.16
I gave him a quick team, OK, and prepared to move the team out of the R-O-N.

35
00:02:22.16 --> 00:02:25.08
However the CNC crew told me to wrap up the mission.

36
00:02:25.08 --> 00:02:28.24
There was another problem that he couldn't discuss on an open frequency.

37
00:02:28.24 --> 00:02:32.88
We knew the NVA monitored Saga FM radio transmissions and had radio direction finding

38
00:02:32.88 --> 00:02:34.20
equipment.

39
00:02:34.20 --> 00:02:39.28
The CNC pilot told us to find an LZ and let him know when we'd be ready for extra

40
00:02:39.28 --> 00:02:40.28
action.

41
00:02:40.28 --> 00:02:45.52
A few minutes later, the green Hornets roared into the new LZ picked us up and returned

42
00:02:45.52 --> 00:02:47.64
us to base.

43
00:02:47.64 --> 00:02:51.96
The reason we were yanked from the field this time stemmed from a tragedy in the Prairie

44
00:02:51.96 --> 00:02:56.24
Fryer area of operations on 30 November.

45
00:02:56.24 --> 00:03:01.32
An H-34 King B was shot out of the sky during an eldest son operation.

46
00:03:01.32 --> 00:03:07.36
Seven green berets from FOB-1 and FOB-4 were killed when an anti-aircraft round struck

47
00:03:07.36 --> 00:03:16.64
the Sakuarski chopper and ignited the ammunition on the aircraft killing everyone on board.

48
00:03:16.64 --> 00:03:23.72
One of the men killed and that ill-fated King B was staff sergeant Arthur E. Bader.

49
00:03:23.72 --> 00:03:25.44
I liked Bader.

50
00:03:25.44 --> 00:03:31.48
On my last night at FOB-1 before shipping out to FOB-6, I played in a poker game where

51
00:03:31.48 --> 00:03:34.44
he won a lot of money.

52
00:03:34.44 --> 00:03:43.84
Along with we played the more money Bader, the more money Bader, the more merouse he became.

53
00:03:43.84 --> 00:03:46.52
At one point, I asked him what was wrong.

54
00:03:46.52 --> 00:03:51.24
He was winning and he was a head several hundred dollars but kept complaining that he'd

55
00:03:51.24 --> 00:03:54.40
never spend the money.

56
00:03:54.40 --> 00:04:00.20
His response was that he had a premonition that he was going to die and that men about

57
00:04:00.20 --> 00:04:06.20
to die often went a lot of money that they would never spend.

58
00:04:06.20 --> 00:04:10.96
We all tried to josh him out of his dark mood but failed.

59
00:04:10.96 --> 00:04:15.08
Bader was a unique special forces green beret.

60
00:04:15.08 --> 00:04:20.60
He had earned and lost three separate fortunes in between three terms in the service.

61
00:04:20.60 --> 00:04:26.12
He was in his 30s but still enjoyed SF, spoke fluid German and a few other languages

62
00:04:26.12 --> 00:04:31.56
and merely wanted to accomplish any mission assigned to him.

63
00:04:31.56 --> 00:04:37.06
On the long flight back to Fubai, I kept hearing him talk to us at the poker table that

64
00:04:37.06 --> 00:04:40.68
last night.

65
00:04:40.68 --> 00:04:49.24
Now he was gone.

66
00:04:49.24 --> 00:05:02.04
And that is the reality of war captured in the best selling book across the fence.

67
00:05:02.04 --> 00:05:08.32
And back with us again to talk about war as the author of that book and of another book

68
00:05:08.32 --> 00:05:12.84
called On the Ground and of a series of books called the Sog Chronicles of Man who has

69
00:05:12.84 --> 00:05:22.24
seen more than most and who has had more close calls than any man should have John Stryker

70
00:05:22.24 --> 00:05:23.24
Meyer.

71
00:05:23.24 --> 00:05:30.56
And if you haven't listened to podcast 180 and 180 one yet go back and listen to them first

72
00:05:30.56 --> 00:05:37.000
to hear the background of this hero, this warrior special forces soldier and leader of

73
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.08
RT Idaho, a recon team for Mac Vsog working missions across the border from Vietnam

74
00:05:45.08 --> 00:05:47.56
into Laos and Cambodia.

75
00:05:47.56 --> 00:05:49.56
John, good evening sir.

76
00:05:49.56 --> 00:05:50.56
Good evening.

77
00:05:50.56 --> 00:05:51.56
Thanks for coming back again.

78
00:05:51.56 --> 00:05:54.76
Glad to be back every time you walk out of the studio about 10 minutes later.

79
00:05:54.76 --> 00:05:58.76
I said if you were in tech say hey can you come back again next week?

80
00:05:58.76 --> 00:05:59.76
We said so much fun.

81
00:05:59.76 --> 00:06:00.76
I can't say no.

82
00:06:00.76 --> 00:06:01.76
That's happened.

83
00:06:01.76 --> 00:06:02.76
That's that happened.

84
00:06:02.76 --> 00:06:05.04
That's how you ended up here again every time you walk out of here I go.

85
00:06:05.04 --> 00:06:08.12
I want to hear you talk more.

86
00:06:08.12 --> 00:06:10.32
Hear more about what you've done.

87
00:06:10.32 --> 00:06:14.72
And yeah, no it's been awesome and there are spots where people have been hit me up.

88
00:06:14.72 --> 00:06:22.000
They've been just just in fraught with what you've been talking about and here in

89
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.60
Utah these stories has been interesting.

90
00:06:26.60 --> 00:06:27.60
You haven't seen this.

91
00:06:27.60 --> 00:06:31.40
Have you heard of a movie character named Jason Born?

92
00:06:31.40 --> 00:06:33.68
Have you heard of this guy?

93
00:06:33.68 --> 00:06:34.68
Yeah.

94
00:06:34.68 --> 00:06:37.76
So I posted a picture of you when you were 21 or 21 or 22.

95
00:06:37.76 --> 00:06:38.76
Right.

96
00:06:38.76 --> 00:06:40.12
He's my illegitimate son.

97
00:06:40.12 --> 00:06:41.12
Yeah.

98
00:06:41.12 --> 00:06:44.92
You got some definite comments about that.

99
00:06:44.92 --> 00:06:45.92
Interesting.

100
00:06:45.92 --> 00:06:46.92
Interesting.

101
00:06:46.92 --> 00:06:50.64
So yeah, we got the real guy back again.

102
00:06:50.64 --> 00:06:58.72
So I know we that first excerpt that I just read was from across the fence and I wanted

103
00:06:58.72 --> 00:07:05.96
to go back to your other book for a little bit, the book on the ground and then I just

104
00:07:05.96 --> 00:07:08.72
want to kind of bunch of things I want to just ask you about and talk to you about.

105
00:07:08.72 --> 00:07:11.16
But I wanted to cover one more section of this book on the ground.

106
00:07:11.16 --> 00:07:16.64
I was reading through it again yesterday and it's just again one of these situations

107
00:07:16.64 --> 00:07:22.80
where I don't know how you're here right now to be honest with you.

108
00:07:22.80 --> 00:07:30.92
Only buddy Grace and guys indeed to be con guys to smother our team and you guys had more

109
00:07:30.92 --> 00:07:33.36
than 100% casualties right.

110
00:07:33.36 --> 00:07:34.68
Correct.

111
00:07:34.68 --> 00:07:39.52
You had guys that you had some guys that had 789 purple hearts.

112
00:07:39.52 --> 00:07:41.52
Bob Howard was putting for 11.

113
00:07:41.52 --> 00:07:43.40
He only received 8.

114
00:07:43.40 --> 00:07:45.32
In my case I've been putting for two more.

115
00:07:45.32 --> 00:07:46.68
But it's just straplish.

116
00:07:46.68 --> 00:07:49.84
Now you look at guys that get to a legs blown off on arms plump.

117
00:07:49.84 --> 00:07:52.72
It's like almost embarrassed to take it.

118
00:07:52.72 --> 00:07:58.20
And anybody got a purple heart in our day, you got really ragged for it.

119
00:07:58.20 --> 00:08:01.28
Because you dumbass, you just couldn't get out of the way fast enough.

120
00:08:01.28 --> 00:08:03.60
You got a purple tart.

121
00:08:03.60 --> 00:08:06.52
I think we had one of my old Vietnam seal buddies.

122
00:08:06.52 --> 00:08:10.24
I think he called it the Viet Cong Achievement Medal.

123
00:08:10.24 --> 00:08:11.56
That's a good one.

124
00:08:11.56 --> 00:08:15.92
I like that.

125
00:08:15.92 --> 00:08:17.52
So you're putting for two more?

126
00:08:17.52 --> 00:08:18.52
How many did you get already?

127
00:08:18.52 --> 00:08:19.52
That was ten one.

128
00:08:19.52 --> 00:08:20.52
Okay.

129
00:08:20.52 --> 00:08:26.60
And again, spider parks and Pat Walkins, my you know, my gurus, my recon gurus.

130
00:08:26.60 --> 00:08:28.56
We had one that had been put in for it.

131
00:08:28.56 --> 00:08:32.52
Just minor straplish the paperwork disappeared.

132
00:08:32.52 --> 00:08:34.32
Another one had more straplish.

133
00:08:34.32 --> 00:08:38.12
And this time with a little bit, a lot more serious bleeding and scratching and stuff.

134
00:08:38.12 --> 00:08:39.12
A little blood.

135
00:08:39.12 --> 00:08:41.44
But I think serious compared to what guys for sure.

136
00:08:41.44 --> 00:08:42.76
They really get hammered.

137
00:08:42.76 --> 00:08:44.44
They said no, put in for it.

138
00:08:44.44 --> 00:08:47.12
Some day you may have to go to the VA.

139
00:08:47.12 --> 00:08:48.12
Right.

140
00:08:48.12 --> 00:08:51.08
Even though the benefits, it's there.

141
00:08:51.08 --> 00:08:52.08
You get home loans.

142
00:08:52.08 --> 00:08:53.08
Oh, okay.

143
00:08:53.08 --> 00:08:54.08
It might be a future.

144
00:08:54.08 --> 00:08:56.08
If we get through this, it might be a future.

145
00:08:56.08 --> 00:08:58.08
Something that still gets a huge 20.

146
00:08:58.08 --> 00:09:00.44
Did it go to Vietnam after three purple hearts?

147
00:09:00.44 --> 00:09:01.44
Was that a rule?

148
00:09:01.44 --> 00:09:02.44
No.

149
00:09:02.44 --> 00:09:03.44
That's not a not a sock.

150
00:09:03.44 --> 00:09:04.44
That might be a normal.

151
00:09:04.44 --> 00:09:06.44
What about a normal soldier?

152
00:09:06.44 --> 00:09:07.44
I wouldn't know.

153
00:09:07.44 --> 00:09:09.44
I never spent any time in a regular unit.

154
00:09:09.44 --> 00:09:10.44
Yeah, no.

155
00:09:10.44 --> 00:09:13.80
I mean Bob Howard, he took his eight.

156
00:09:13.80 --> 00:09:15.04
And he sort of had eleven.

157
00:09:15.04 --> 00:09:16.04
All the clusters.

158
00:09:16.04 --> 00:09:18.08
They guess they've read out a clusters for those.

159
00:09:18.08 --> 00:09:22.52
Yeah, and you talk about in saw Chronicles while you're one, what was it?

160
00:09:22.52 --> 00:09:27.72
16 guys went out, 16 special forces soldiers went out, and they got 33 purple hearts

161
00:09:27.72 --> 00:09:28.72
in four days.

162
00:09:28.72 --> 00:09:29.72
Oh, yeah.

163
00:09:29.72 --> 00:09:31.28
And probably go to gotten more.

164
00:09:31.28 --> 00:09:32.72
Sure.

165
00:09:32.72 --> 00:09:33.72
Ridiculous.

166
00:09:33.72 --> 00:09:34.72
Absolutely.

167
00:09:34.72 --> 00:09:35.72
It's crazy.

168
00:09:35.72 --> 00:09:36.72
Yeah.

169
00:09:36.72 --> 00:09:37.72
All right.

170
00:09:37.72 --> 00:09:40.88
We're going back to on the ground.

171
00:09:40.88 --> 00:09:41.88
Here we go.

172
00:09:41.88 --> 00:09:45.76
The Huey's lifted off made a general lazy turn and pointed their noses northwest.

173
00:09:45.76 --> 00:09:49.64
Once everyone was settled, I allowed my mind to wander as I looked out in Marford, and

174
00:09:49.64 --> 00:09:54.24
how beautiful the landscape was from several thousand feet up in the air, up where it was

175
00:09:54.24 --> 00:09:58.48
open and cool rather than closed in muggy.

176
00:09:58.48 --> 00:10:01.36
There was also a sense of inner peace and pride.

177
00:10:01.36 --> 00:10:04.52
This is what I had volunteered and trained so hard for.

178
00:10:04.52 --> 00:10:08.68
This chance to run top-secret missions behind enemy lines, dangerous missions that made

179
00:10:08.68 --> 00:10:10.36
a difference.

180
00:10:10.36 --> 00:10:15.72
Like most special forces types, I couldn't stomach the monotonous routines of camp life.

181
00:10:15.72 --> 00:10:25.28
The ash and trash detail stuff, the petty rules, regulations, formations, and egos.

182
00:10:25.28 --> 00:10:26.44
More amazing yet.

183
00:10:26.44 --> 00:10:32.84
Here I was at the ripe old age of 22, sporting the exalted rank of E4 and the one zero

184
00:10:32.84 --> 00:10:36.72
of a sog recon team.

185
00:10:36.72 --> 00:10:38.84
22 years old.

186
00:10:38.84 --> 00:10:42.40
Young and dumb.

187
00:10:42.40 --> 00:10:43.40
Yeah.

188
00:10:43.40 --> 00:10:44.40
22 years old.

189
00:10:44.40 --> 00:10:45.40
You've been busted.

190
00:10:45.40 --> 00:10:48.28
If you hadn't been budged, you got busted down once or twice.

191
00:10:48.28 --> 00:10:49.28
Only once.

192
00:10:49.28 --> 00:10:51.08
So you would have been an E5 you think at this point?

193
00:10:51.08 --> 00:10:57.44
I would have been up most of the power for yes, at least an E5.

194
00:10:57.44 --> 00:10:59.76
That must have been crazy.

195
00:10:59.76 --> 00:11:04.36
Because usually you got promoted based on, if you run a missions, whenever the appropriate

196
00:11:04.36 --> 00:11:09.16
time frame was, to be in one grade before you be considered for the next, sagging was really

197
00:11:09.16 --> 00:11:11.92
good about getting the promotions, at least our people were.

198
00:11:11.92 --> 00:11:15.96
So as soon as you'd accomplish your time in rank, you get out of me, do you?

199
00:11:15.96 --> 00:11:16.96
Do you get out of me, do you?

200
00:11:16.96 --> 00:11:20.68
For a really quick.

201
00:11:20.68 --> 00:11:30.76
So when you, this idea of being an SF and just being on camp and on base and having the

202
00:11:30.76 --> 00:11:34.24
normal kind of routines, you just couldn't stand that.

203
00:11:34.24 --> 00:11:35.24
No.

204
00:11:35.24 --> 00:11:36.24
Yes, would rather be out in the field.

205
00:11:36.24 --> 00:11:41.88
Oh, yeah, it's just trash and nuts.

206
00:11:41.88 --> 00:11:42.88
Okay.

207
00:11:42.88 --> 00:11:43.88
All right.

208
00:11:43.88 --> 00:11:44.88
Here we go back to the book.

209
00:11:44.88 --> 00:11:47.20
I had been with RTI to hope for seven months now.

210
00:11:47.20 --> 00:11:51.40
By the end of hard work, lots of mission experience and simply having survived, I was

211
00:11:51.40 --> 00:11:52.92
now a team leader.

212
00:11:52.92 --> 00:11:56.16
At a moment's notice, I could have millions of millions of dollars worth of air support

213
00:11:56.16 --> 00:12:02.04
assets, some of the man by majors and lieutenant kernels, all doing my bidding, all giving

214
00:12:02.04 --> 00:12:04.52
their courageous best to save my bacon.

215
00:12:04.52 --> 00:12:08.92
I'd come a long way since flunking out a college and doing a stint as a garbage collector

216
00:12:08.92 --> 00:12:12.36
in the Ocembary National Park.

217
00:12:12.36 --> 00:12:16.84
My egotistical reveries were cut short when the door gunner on my side of the Huey decided

218
00:12:16.84 --> 00:12:21.32
to cut loose with a long burst of M60 machine gun fire right next to my ear.

219
00:12:21.32 --> 00:12:25.72
Fortunately, he was simply test firing it.

220
00:12:25.72 --> 00:12:30.64
You know, we would get, I guess, kind of similar is we'd be driving to a target, right,

221
00:12:30.64 --> 00:12:34.96
being in a home V. You know, sometimes the targets are an hour, sometimes two hours.

222
00:12:34.96 --> 00:12:37.24
You know, we did some long, long transit.

223
00:12:37.24 --> 00:12:44.76
But you would get time to sit there and think about stuff because, well, you're sitting

224
00:12:44.76 --> 00:12:47.76
there being transport, there's not too much you can do.

225
00:12:47.76 --> 00:12:51.16
You know, you're scanned and you're looking for, but you're in a helicopter, there's

226
00:12:51.16 --> 00:12:52.64
nothing to do, but think really.

227
00:12:52.64 --> 00:12:56.44
It was always amazing because it's just so beautiful.

228
00:12:56.44 --> 00:13:00.88
I mean, southeast Asia from the air, even when you went over a combat zone, you see

229
00:13:00.88 --> 00:13:07.04
the bomb creators and you, but the jungle was just, just beautiful country.

230
00:13:07.04 --> 00:13:11.60
And then you get to under it and get into the underbell of the jungle that's like, you

231
00:13:11.60 --> 00:13:13.40
know, it's another whole world.

232
00:13:13.40 --> 00:13:15.40
The Starling contrast, you know?

233
00:13:15.40 --> 00:13:19.52
And like if you're in the desert, it has this own beauty.

234
00:13:19.52 --> 00:13:24.16
And it can be spell binding if you just watch it with a while, look at this, without realizing

235
00:13:24.16 --> 00:13:29.04
the somewhere, there's a little hole, some guy can pop out up and hit you with an RPG or

236
00:13:29.04 --> 00:13:31.16
detonate in your case.

237
00:13:31.16 --> 00:13:32.16
Does it smoke controls?

238
00:13:32.16 --> 00:13:33.16
Yeah.

239
00:13:33.16 --> 00:13:35.60
When you roll over.

240
00:13:35.60 --> 00:13:41.60
Did you, it sounds like you recognize this when you were doing these operations, you

241
00:13:41.60 --> 00:13:49.28
kind of knew that this was, I don't know, I guess I'm going to use this word.

242
00:13:49.28 --> 00:13:50.92
You were lucky to be there.

243
00:13:50.92 --> 00:13:57.60
Oh, clearly, because I won 100% when I was in Iraq and I only did two to pull on this

244
00:13:57.60 --> 00:14:02.60
to Iraq, I won 100% new every day that I was there.

245
00:14:02.60 --> 00:14:10.08
I knew that this was like my time, this is what I'd been, this is what I would lived

246
00:14:10.08 --> 00:14:11.08
for.

247
00:14:11.08 --> 00:14:12.08
And I knew that.

248
00:14:12.08 --> 00:14:14.32
It wasn't like I looked back and say, I wouldn't really wish I would have appreciated

249
00:14:14.32 --> 00:14:15.32
those days.

250
00:14:15.32 --> 00:14:20.92
No, when I was in them, I completely knew it and appreciated being there, like every

251
00:14:20.92 --> 00:14:21.92
single day.

252
00:14:21.92 --> 00:14:22.92
Yeah.

253
00:14:22.92 --> 00:14:30.32
And I, it was a nice feeling personally to think that, here we are, we're the best

254
00:14:30.32 --> 00:14:34.56
and we're running the missions and that's what we live for.

255
00:14:34.56 --> 00:14:42.12
Okay, now we're here, let's go do this and just hope to get the mission done and just

256
00:14:42.12 --> 00:14:44.84
wish the Dan track, or so leave your lungs, you get the mission done.

257
00:14:44.84 --> 00:14:48.52
Good do to our tapers, naturopio, W. Something like that.

258
00:14:48.52 --> 00:14:52.64
Oh, yeah, it felt good, but you know, it's like quiet professionals, just don't talk

259
00:14:52.64 --> 00:14:53.64
about that much.

260
00:14:53.64 --> 00:14:54.64
Yeah.

261
00:14:54.64 --> 00:15:00.20
Going back to the book as we approached the LZ, the team crowded the two doors of

262
00:15:00.20 --> 00:15:01.20
the helicopter.

263
00:15:01.20 --> 00:15:03.48
I was on the right half standing on the skid.

264
00:15:03.48 --> 00:15:07.24
Sau was kneeling behind me as hand on my shoulder ready to follow me out the door.

265
00:15:07.24 --> 00:15:13.52
Next to him was, hip, my one-one, John Bubba, sure, along with fuck our point man and

266
00:15:13.52 --> 00:15:17.64
Tuan are Grenadier, got ready to exit out the left side door.

267
00:15:17.64 --> 00:15:21.84
We all kept her eyes riveted on the looming jungle, scanning for any signs of movement

268
00:15:21.84 --> 00:15:24.36
in the tree lines surrounding our LZ.

269
00:15:24.36 --> 00:15:29.08
The top of the triple canopy growth of trees, vines and other vegetation was at least

270
00:15:29.08 --> 00:15:33.80
100 feet off the jungle floor and the opening into which we were descending reminded me of

271
00:15:33.80 --> 00:15:39.12
the mouth of a long dark tunnel at the bottom of which resided things, Alice never dreamed

272
00:15:39.12 --> 00:15:42.60
of when she tumbled into that rabbit hole of hers.

273
00:15:42.60 --> 00:15:53.28
As we were swallowed up and the darkness increased, a cold chill ran down my spine.

274
00:15:53.28 --> 00:15:58.24
When you're going into these spots, so you had pre-identified this LZ prior to.

275
00:15:58.24 --> 00:15:59.60
Is that correct?

276
00:15:59.60 --> 00:16:04.20
At that point, we were working with Kavi at Dornner Briefing.

277
00:16:04.20 --> 00:16:12.56
We would give out the official LZs, the primary secondary alternate and that would go to

278
00:16:12.56 --> 00:16:13.56
Saigon.

279
00:16:13.56 --> 00:16:18.44
Then we whispered as you're finding something else because we knew that there was a little

280
00:16:18.44 --> 00:16:19.44
scrubbed.

281
00:16:19.44 --> 00:16:23.24
And then, so by finding something else, you're basically just looking for a clearing of

282
00:16:23.24 --> 00:16:28.20
some kind of general within that target and usually to be somewhere as else they go.

283
00:16:28.20 --> 00:16:33.36
And somewhere as we were Saigon, the leak there wouldn't get the word back because we had

284
00:16:33.36 --> 00:16:34.36
that one target.

285
00:16:34.36 --> 00:16:36.32
We went in with the bomb.

286
00:16:36.32 --> 00:16:38.36
The LZ was little, he wired.

287
00:16:38.36 --> 00:16:42.32
And the top security had wire already with a 500 pounder.

288
00:16:42.32 --> 00:16:45.48
So we were beginning to do that much more often than.

289
00:16:45.48 --> 00:16:47.56
Could we had great cubbies?

290
00:16:47.56 --> 00:16:48.56
They knew what we did.

291
00:16:48.56 --> 00:16:52.08
The cubbies fly the area of operations before you inserted.

292
00:16:52.08 --> 00:16:54.56
Like the AB4 or anything like that?

293
00:16:54.56 --> 00:16:56.52
Well, Dornner Day up, they would just fly over it.

294
00:16:56.52 --> 00:16:57.52
Sure.

295
00:16:57.52 --> 00:16:59.52
Is this picture or anything?

296
00:16:59.52 --> 00:17:00.52
No.

297
00:17:00.52 --> 00:17:01.52
No.

298
00:17:01.52 --> 00:17:06.48
Usually they would just do a VR visual reconnaissance and they would try to be subtle about

299
00:17:06.48 --> 00:17:11.48
like in early 68, we always flew a visual reconnaissance prior to the mission.

300
00:17:11.48 --> 00:17:14.12
And the NVA is not stupid.

301
00:17:14.12 --> 00:17:17.60
If they see a bird dog flying over a target, they figure well, pretty soon we're going

302
00:17:17.60 --> 00:17:20.60
to get visitors and sure enough.

303
00:17:20.60 --> 00:17:22.84
So like gave them time to get ready.

304
00:17:22.84 --> 00:17:27.72
So we basically cut out the VRs on our part.

305
00:17:27.72 --> 00:17:31.76
And then when cubbie go out, you know, a lot of guys have been flying.

306
00:17:31.76 --> 00:17:35.04
They're more familiar with the VR with the helicopter.

307
00:17:35.04 --> 00:17:36.04
Oh no, no.

308
00:17:36.04 --> 00:17:42.80
Usually with South Vietnamese Air Force, they have a little 01 just like from World War

309
00:17:42.80 --> 00:17:43.80
2.

310
00:17:43.80 --> 00:17:47.48
The one from the battle from the bulls were heavy fondant's up there in the right seat.

311
00:17:47.48 --> 00:17:51.16
And the power's cut, this little cub, the piper cup is going 88 miles an hour.

312
00:17:51.16 --> 00:17:53.40
Top speed downhill.

313
00:17:53.40 --> 00:17:54.40
Yeah.

314
00:17:54.40 --> 00:17:58.60
And that's what, and so that would be most of our VRs.

315
00:17:58.60 --> 00:18:03.40
But then by Christmas, we pretty much cut that out.

316
00:18:03.40 --> 00:18:06.28
And that just because they were, that was given away.

317
00:18:06.28 --> 00:18:11.96
We used to ride on logistics air and kind of move the logistics air a little bit to

318
00:18:11.96 --> 00:18:13.88
over an air that we were going over.

319
00:18:13.88 --> 00:18:19.06
So no one would know that we were in there, that we were taking pictures, you know, like

320
00:18:19.06 --> 00:18:23.98
just logistics air, just an aircraft flying somewhere, they'd go in a straight line.

321
00:18:23.98 --> 00:18:27.62
They wouldn't, they'd just veer off a little bit so we could see what we wanted to see.

322
00:18:27.62 --> 00:18:28.62
Sure.

323
00:18:28.62 --> 00:18:32.50
And then also the fake ill fake inserts.

324
00:18:32.50 --> 00:18:35.70
Sometimes they didn't have the fuel to do a lot fake inserts.

325
00:18:35.70 --> 00:18:41.78
But they had the device called the nightingale where they would go in to a nightingale

326
00:18:41.78 --> 00:18:44.38
often pull the detonator on it.

327
00:18:44.38 --> 00:18:47.18
And it was sound like a firefight.

328
00:18:47.18 --> 00:18:49.18
So that would have a lot of commotion.

329
00:18:49.18 --> 00:18:53.02
And then they would jump up, go to a second LZ and put a send.

330
00:18:53.02 --> 00:18:56.98
And down south, we were with the green hornets.

331
00:18:56.98 --> 00:19:01.14
They really had it cold, because it was flat, down, up, down, up.

332
00:19:01.14 --> 00:19:05.86
So if the NV, we're trying to guess which of the three of four touchdowns where we were,

333
00:19:05.86 --> 00:19:07.70
they were really busy.

334
00:19:07.70 --> 00:19:08.70
Got it.

335
00:19:08.70 --> 00:19:13.78
Going back to the book as the chopper near the jungle floor, Bubba and I executed our first

336
00:19:13.78 --> 00:19:17.58
and standard operating procedure, which was checking the LZ for trip wires or booby traps while

337
00:19:17.58 --> 00:19:21.30
the rest of the team searched the surrounding jungle for any signs of trouble.

338
00:19:21.30 --> 00:19:24.82
After giving the all clear, the team was out the doors and all in the ground before the

339
00:19:24.82 --> 00:19:26.62
skids firmly touched down.

340
00:19:26.62 --> 00:19:29.26
How long would you hover there and look at the LZ for?

341
00:19:29.26 --> 00:19:30.26
Oh, not long.

342
00:19:30.26 --> 00:19:31.78
Like a matter of ten seconds.

343
00:19:31.78 --> 00:19:34.78
Just like you got to go in, touch down, get out.

344
00:19:34.78 --> 00:19:35.78
Sure.

345
00:19:35.78 --> 00:19:37.78
Yeah, we used to just jump out, lay down.

346
00:19:37.78 --> 00:19:40.42
Like the helicopter would just touch and take off.

347
00:19:40.42 --> 00:19:42.62
It would just jump out, lay down right there.

348
00:19:42.62 --> 00:19:43.62
We wouldn't move away from it.

349
00:19:43.62 --> 00:19:44.62
Just jump out, lay down.

350
00:19:44.62 --> 00:19:46.62
Modern day version of touching gun.

351
00:19:46.62 --> 00:19:47.62
Yeah.

352
00:19:47.62 --> 00:19:48.62
Yeah.

353
00:19:48.62 --> 00:19:51.82
We quickly headed into the wood line and set up a provisional perimeter where we could wait and

354
00:19:51.82 --> 00:19:53.82
listen.

355
00:19:53.82 --> 00:19:55.74
When again, we saw and heard nothing suspicious.

356
00:19:55.74 --> 00:19:58.94
We burrow deeper into the jungle where it was both dancer and darker.

357
00:19:58.94 --> 00:20:03.18
Like some furative predatory animal, we were looking to hide ourselves.

358
00:20:03.18 --> 00:20:07.74
After ten minutes of no threatening sounds or movements, I radioed Covey and gave him the

359
00:20:07.74 --> 00:20:09.62
message he had been waiting to hear.

360
00:20:09.62 --> 00:20:11.26
Team OK.

361
00:20:11.26 --> 00:20:16.86
He and others could take up breathing again, at least for the time being.

362
00:20:16.86 --> 00:20:21.10
The deeper we moved in, the deeper we moved the darker and more claustrophobic things

363
00:20:21.10 --> 00:20:22.50
became.

364
00:20:22.50 --> 00:20:27.78
Moving through the foliage was an excruciatingly slow and painful process with sweat stinging

365
00:20:27.78 --> 00:20:35.58
one's eyes, bugs crawling and feasting upon exposed skin and visibility cut to mere feet.

366
00:20:35.58 --> 00:20:41.22
It could be also be disorienting, especially when the maps we were given were so useless.

367
00:20:41.22 --> 00:20:46.94
And here was RT Idaho looking for fuel lines, some bright eyed Covey rider had spotted

368
00:20:46.94 --> 00:20:49.34
and directed aerostracks against.

369
00:20:49.34 --> 00:20:54.18
Intelligence reports said there was a second pipeline in this A.O. as well, regardless

370
00:20:54.18 --> 00:20:59.50
of how many any pipeline we found we were going to destroy.

371
00:20:59.50 --> 00:21:00.50
What were the maps?

372
00:21:00.50 --> 00:21:01.50
Were you one to 50 maps?

373
00:21:01.50 --> 00:21:02.50
Is that what you had?

374
00:21:02.50 --> 00:21:03.50
Yeah.

375
00:21:03.50 --> 00:21:04.50
One to 50,000?

376
00:21:04.50 --> 00:21:05.50
Right.

377
00:21:05.50 --> 00:21:07.14
But they would cut out from the big map.

378
00:21:07.14 --> 00:21:13.14
They would cut out like a 10 by 10 or 12 by 12 square so that if we were killed, they came

379
00:21:13.14 --> 00:21:17.62
across the map to be no other intel on a separate at one target area that we were on

380
00:21:17.62 --> 00:21:18.62
the ground.

381
00:21:18.62 --> 00:21:23.66
Now, I've gone into triple canopy jungle before with what he ever had as you know,

382
00:21:23.66 --> 00:21:25.98
one to 24 map.

383
00:21:25.98 --> 00:21:27.66
They're basically more detailed.

384
00:21:27.66 --> 00:21:28.66
Yes.

385
00:21:28.66 --> 00:21:32.98
Their twice as detailed and they're pretty good, but one to 50s are not that accurate.

386
00:21:32.98 --> 00:21:33.98
No.

387
00:21:33.98 --> 00:21:37.06
We had that one target where they had forgotten a mountain.

388
00:21:37.06 --> 00:21:38.78
You know, we're on a mountain.

389
00:21:38.78 --> 00:21:41.26
We're getting ready to go down the go over and we look at it.

390
00:21:41.26 --> 00:21:43.26
It's like, hey, they forgot one.

391
00:21:43.26 --> 00:21:44.26
It's not really good.

392
00:21:44.26 --> 00:21:48.98
Stretch your mission out when you're in triple canopy.

393
00:21:48.98 --> 00:21:49.82
Cluster phobic.

394
00:21:49.82 --> 00:21:53.42
You use that word cluster phobic quite a bit in this section.

395
00:21:53.42 --> 00:21:56.50
Is this jungle just tight?

396
00:21:56.50 --> 00:21:57.50
Very.

397
00:21:57.50 --> 00:22:01.86
Yeah, because again, sometimes you had to keep sight on the guy in front of you as you

398
00:22:01.86 --> 00:22:06.30
moved because he just becomes separated so easily.

399
00:22:06.30 --> 00:22:12.10
Because of the dense vegetation, of course, a lot of times our Vietnamese were shorter.

400
00:22:12.10 --> 00:22:13.10
They could get through a quick.

401
00:22:13.10 --> 00:22:15.10
Well, we would be down on our knees.

402
00:22:15.10 --> 00:22:18.50
I wore out more pants crawling through the jungle.

403
00:22:18.50 --> 00:22:20.30
I know, I saw a picture.

404
00:22:20.30 --> 00:22:21.62
I was looking at the pictures in the books.

405
00:22:21.62 --> 00:22:22.62
I saw a picture.

406
00:22:22.62 --> 00:22:24.62
One of the images is that some of those guys were really small.

407
00:22:24.62 --> 00:22:25.62
Oh, yeah.

408
00:22:25.62 --> 00:22:26.62
Really small.

409
00:22:26.62 --> 00:22:27.98
98 pounds, so can wet.

410
00:22:27.98 --> 00:22:29.98
But 50 pounds are hard.

411
00:22:29.98 --> 00:22:32.46
That's awesome.

412
00:22:32.46 --> 00:22:34.54
All right, I go back to the book.

413
00:22:34.54 --> 00:22:36.58
But I had more immediate and pressing concerns.

414
00:22:36.58 --> 00:22:40.90
The adrenaline rush that always accompanied an insertion had pretty much worn off.

415
00:22:40.90 --> 00:22:44.58
And another characteristic sensation had begun to take its place.

416
00:22:44.58 --> 00:22:49.98
It was a feeling of familiarity and comfort combined with an e-resensitive for boating.

417
00:22:49.98 --> 00:22:52.42
Both were a product of experience.

418
00:22:52.42 --> 00:22:56.98
I was comfortable because I was surrounded by extraordinary, well-trained and fiercely

419
00:22:56.98 --> 00:23:00.34
devoted team that knew what it was doing.

420
00:23:00.34 --> 00:23:06.14
Yet we also had stepped in enough accidental shit and had encountered so many hostile

421
00:23:06.14 --> 00:23:11.86
enemy units that it was impossible to not feel serious anxiety.

422
00:23:11.86 --> 00:23:16.74
In fact, I figured that when I stopped being scared, shitless, I would be on my way to

423
00:23:16.74 --> 00:23:19.06
buying the farm.

424
00:23:19.06 --> 00:23:24.34
Cochines had cost more than one life.

425
00:23:24.34 --> 00:23:30.94
But you still get that little mixed feeling of comfort, but fear and anxiety at the same

426
00:23:30.94 --> 00:23:31.94
time.

427
00:23:31.94 --> 00:23:32.94
Yes.

428
00:23:32.94 --> 00:23:37.94
You know, the whole adrenaline of the e-mail is, you get a certain, you're just pumped.

429
00:23:37.94 --> 00:23:40.26
And at some point you get off and get on the ground.

430
00:23:40.26 --> 00:23:44.42
It's just because you guys would hit so many times you would insert immediately get contacted.

431
00:23:44.42 --> 00:23:46.10
A lot of times, yeah.

432
00:23:46.10 --> 00:23:52.66
So once you be amped up going in and then when there's nothing there, that starts to fade.

433
00:23:52.66 --> 00:23:56.74
Yeah, then you finally get on the ground, it's like, oh, at last, we're on the ground.

434
00:23:56.74 --> 00:23:59.10
Now, let's get on with the mission.

435
00:23:59.10 --> 00:24:00.58
We're about to trackers.

436
00:24:00.58 --> 00:24:01.58
Let's get moving.

437
00:24:01.58 --> 00:24:03.70
But let's also stay cognizant.

438
00:24:03.70 --> 00:24:07.58
Could it keep our situational awareness tight?

439
00:24:07.58 --> 00:24:13.18
And that, you know, this is one of the reasons I highlighted this section is, you know,

440
00:24:13.18 --> 00:24:16.54
just this is something that, you know, what we talk about complacency all the time.

441
00:24:16.54 --> 00:24:21.14
I know there was a board of Marine Corps units we were with the three eight and

442
00:24:21.14 --> 00:24:25.90
a body, they had a, that aside, that signs around their compound complacency kills.

443
00:24:25.90 --> 00:24:26.90
Yeah.

444
00:24:26.90 --> 00:24:27.90
For sure.

445
00:24:27.90 --> 00:24:35.54
But this idea of, and you know, I also talk to young military guys, young seals, that,

446
00:24:35.54 --> 00:24:37.30
you know, they're, they're scared of this, they're scared of that.

447
00:24:37.30 --> 00:24:40.74
That's like, I always tell them, good, you know, you should, you should be afraid.

448
00:24:40.74 --> 00:24:43.54
Because if you're afraid, you're going to prepare more, you're going to train harbor, you're

449
00:24:43.54 --> 00:24:47.18
going to, you're not going to cut any corners, you're not going to get complacent.

450
00:24:47.18 --> 00:24:52.74
And that's the same thing that you're saying here is you'd seen cockiness, cost people

451
00:24:52.74 --> 00:24:55.34
their lives because they think, oh, we can just get away with whatever.

452
00:24:55.34 --> 00:24:57.34
Yeah, if you're not scared, I'm scared of you.

453
00:24:57.34 --> 00:24:58.34
Really?

454
00:24:58.34 --> 00:24:59.34
Yeah.

455
00:24:59.34 --> 00:25:00.34
Yeah.

456
00:25:00.34 --> 00:25:06.18
And then you have to overcome that though, because you can't let that get, get control.

457
00:25:06.18 --> 00:25:09.42
And you were talking before we started recording, we were talking about a guy that was in

458
00:25:09.42 --> 00:25:13.54
a firefight and there was one guy that didn't fire a shot, stayed curled up in a ball,

459
00:25:13.54 --> 00:25:14.54
praying.

460
00:25:14.54 --> 00:25:15.54
Yeah.

461
00:25:15.54 --> 00:25:19.70
That's when that's when fear is not, not your friend.

462
00:25:19.70 --> 00:25:26.06
Yeah, our guys wanted to shoot him.

463
00:25:26.06 --> 00:25:29.54
So you got a balance that, you got to have the fear, you got to feel it, but you got

464
00:25:29.54 --> 00:25:30.54
to deal with it.

465
00:25:30.54 --> 00:25:34.02
Correct.

466
00:25:34.02 --> 00:25:36.30
We had compasses.

467
00:25:36.30 --> 00:25:39.78
So we knew the general direction we were headed, which was to the northwest away from

468
00:25:39.78 --> 00:25:40.78
the LZ.

469
00:25:40.78 --> 00:25:43.94
We had been working our way slowly through the underbrush for about an hour when suddenly

470
00:25:43.94 --> 00:25:46.02
we heard an explosion behind us.

471
00:25:46.02 --> 00:25:50.06
It had to have been the Claymore bubble rig to go off if anyone tried to follow us off

472
00:25:50.06 --> 00:25:51.46
the LZ.

473
00:25:51.46 --> 00:25:56.42
It's detonation, singled, signaled a profound change in the situation.

474
00:25:56.42 --> 00:26:00.42
The hunters were about to become the hunted.

475
00:26:00.42 --> 00:26:05.74
In the jungle, there are almost always animal noises of some kind and these suddenly

476
00:26:05.74 --> 00:26:07.94
fell silent.

477
00:26:07.94 --> 00:26:12.62
In the quiet, we could hear some distressing sounds to the west, sounds that were not

478
00:26:12.62 --> 00:26:22.34
of a jungle kind, but those of men on the move we were not alone.

479
00:26:22.34 --> 00:26:26.14
Welcome to the jungle, baby.

480
00:26:26.14 --> 00:26:28.82
Yes indeed.

481
00:26:28.82 --> 00:26:34.02
How do you know that the Claymore's that you rigged weren't set off by some kind of monkey

482
00:26:34.02 --> 00:26:36.34
or whatever, some kind of animal?

483
00:26:36.34 --> 00:26:41.22
Would you guys rig a certain way that that was unlikely?

484
00:26:41.22 --> 00:26:45.38
The way bubble and the Frenchman later would do it in Lin.

485
00:26:45.38 --> 00:26:50.74
They would put it in an area where it would be easiest for the trackers to follow.

486
00:26:50.74 --> 00:26:52.70
So you'd just based on human nature.

487
00:26:52.70 --> 00:26:53.70
You're going to go through this.

488
00:26:53.70 --> 00:26:56.98
Take part, you're going to go where it's easier to travel.

489
00:26:56.98 --> 00:26:58.94
And it could have been an animal.

490
00:26:58.94 --> 00:27:02.34
But basically it's an NVA animal.

491
00:27:02.34 --> 00:27:04.86
Yeah.

492
00:27:04.86 --> 00:27:08.46
The coincidence would be too much and the chances are it's just NVA.

493
00:27:08.46 --> 00:27:13.50
And if it is a monkey as opposed to an NVA, we'll find that out within the next couple

494
00:27:13.50 --> 00:27:14.50
hours.

495
00:27:14.50 --> 00:27:17.42
On the other hand, let's get ready.

496
00:27:17.42 --> 00:27:21.86
And there was an enemy moving in the jungle.

497
00:27:21.86 --> 00:27:24.42
The animals would stop making noises.

498
00:27:24.42 --> 00:27:26.38
It all depends how close they were.

499
00:27:26.38 --> 00:27:30.22
But yes, lots of, that's why the most important thing in the jungle was listening.

500
00:27:30.22 --> 00:27:31.22
Yeah.

501
00:27:31.22 --> 00:27:33.34
I mean, 10 and 10 sounds pretty extreme.

502
00:27:33.34 --> 00:27:38.66
But it really gives you time to hear what's going on.

503
00:27:38.66 --> 00:27:40.10
Because you're a lot of time, you can't see it.

504
00:27:40.10 --> 00:27:42.10
That's the best sense in the jungle.

505
00:27:42.10 --> 00:27:45.86
Like I said, I've been in Triple Canopy and we've done Patrol and in Triple Canopy.

506
00:27:45.86 --> 00:27:47.42
And you could hit by monkeys too, right?

507
00:27:47.42 --> 00:27:48.42
Yeah.

508
00:27:48.42 --> 00:27:51.26
We had monkeys freak us out.

509
00:27:51.26 --> 00:27:57.98
But that the sense just so people can understand, you can only see it in that thick jungle.

510
00:27:57.98 --> 00:27:59.98
Sometimes you can only see five feet.

511
00:27:59.98 --> 00:28:00.98
Sure.

512
00:28:00.98 --> 00:28:01.98
Five or ten feet at the most.

513
00:28:01.98 --> 00:28:07.54
So you patrol for 10 minutes and then you just stop everyone is quiet and you listen

514
00:28:07.54 --> 00:28:10.38
to see if anyone's following you to see if there's any other movement out there.

515
00:28:10.38 --> 00:28:11.70
That's what you're doing.

516
00:28:11.70 --> 00:28:12.70
Sure.

517
00:28:12.70 --> 00:28:18.46
I mean, and it's so thick that if I'm behind a point man or sometimes it would be a point

518
00:28:18.46 --> 00:28:21.06
man was sal and myself.

519
00:28:21.06 --> 00:28:22.06
Why would never see a point man?

520
00:28:22.06 --> 00:28:27.34
I would just keep an eye on sal and the guy behind me would just be on my backpack.

521
00:28:27.34 --> 00:28:30.30
I wouldn't, I couldn't tell you where the point man was.

522
00:28:30.30 --> 00:28:34.38
I just follow sal and the vegetation was that thick a lot of times.

523
00:28:34.38 --> 00:28:43.10
And again, I'm depending on the Vietnamese because they know they didn't have a jungle

524
00:28:43.10 --> 00:28:44.10
better to make.

525
00:28:44.10 --> 00:28:46.22
How come the animals would stop making noise?

526
00:28:46.22 --> 00:28:48.54
Would the animal stop making noise when you would patrol?

527
00:28:48.54 --> 00:28:50.54
I would assume.

528
00:28:50.54 --> 00:28:53.22
But once we settle down, things would come back normal.

529
00:28:53.22 --> 00:28:56.94
So when you stop moving, then the sounds would escalate.

530
00:28:56.94 --> 00:29:01.58
And if they didn't have to 10 minutes ago, the puck of faker tightens up to a little

531
00:29:01.58 --> 00:29:06.18
little bit more.

532
00:29:06.18 --> 00:29:13.26
I immediately signaled Falk, who is on point to head north.

533
00:29:13.26 --> 00:29:15.86
This would take us up a hill that dominated our right flank.

534
00:29:15.86 --> 00:29:19.26
The climb was pretty severe, which was good and bad news.

535
00:29:19.26 --> 00:29:23.06
Well, it made the going rough at all so meant we were gaining some genuine high ground

536
00:29:23.06 --> 00:29:26.70
and high ground is the preferred position when it comes to defense.

537
00:29:26.70 --> 00:29:30.58
The steepness also meant the enemy would have to work as hard as we were.

538
00:29:30.58 --> 00:29:35.74
I couldn't tell how close the NVA trackers were or how many of them were headed our way.

539
00:29:35.74 --> 00:29:40.82
But I knew if push came to shove, I wanted to be looking down on them.

540
00:29:40.82 --> 00:29:42.66
Always take the high ground.

541
00:29:42.66 --> 00:29:43.66
Always.

542
00:29:43.66 --> 00:29:46.06
That's just military maximum.

543
00:29:46.06 --> 00:29:50.50
And you know, I actually say you take the moral high ground as well.

544
00:29:50.50 --> 00:29:52.54
Take the high ground to take you.

545
00:29:52.54 --> 00:29:54.54
Amen.

546
00:29:54.54 --> 00:30:00.06
When we reach the hilltop, just as dark clouds unleashed the torrent of rain.

547
00:30:00.06 --> 00:30:05.10
While Bubba and Sau began setting out a perimeter of claymores, I contacted Covey and

548
00:30:05.10 --> 00:30:08.90
appraised him of the situation, namely that it didn't look good and that we might be calling

549
00:30:08.90 --> 00:30:11.26
for an immediate extraction before nightfall.

550
00:30:11.26 --> 00:30:13.46
Did you guys speak at all?

551
00:30:13.46 --> 00:30:16.18
Only minimal, because most of it would be hand-saint-looking.

552
00:30:16.18 --> 00:30:18.18
Just everything, as you can see.

553
00:30:18.18 --> 00:30:21.78
Estrogationally, you'd have to whisper near.

554
00:30:21.78 --> 00:30:24.90
But if we just void it as much as we could.

555
00:30:24.90 --> 00:30:28.82
But something like this, just so people understand, something like this, you're on patrol.

556
00:30:28.82 --> 00:30:30.18
You're not saying anything.

557
00:30:30.18 --> 00:30:32.14
You head up the hill, you don't say anything.

558
00:30:32.14 --> 00:30:35.34
You get to perimeter, you give the perimeter signal, you don't say anything.

559
00:30:35.34 --> 00:30:36.90
Everyone knows what to do when you're in there.

560
00:30:36.90 --> 00:30:39.18
You could go days out in the field without talking.

561
00:30:39.18 --> 00:30:40.66
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

562
00:30:40.66 --> 00:30:45.54
Because with the training, as a pushe, you got the visual with the person that you're

563
00:30:45.54 --> 00:30:46.54
signaling.

564
00:30:46.54 --> 00:30:50.70
Like, in my case, if I'm behind fuck the point, man, I'm telling him what to do and I'll

565
00:30:50.70 --> 00:30:54.30
turn around, tell the guy behind me, same signals, and then we go.

566
00:30:54.30 --> 00:30:54.30
Yeah.

567
00:30:54.30 --> 00:31:03.10
While I was talking to Covey, SAU who had moved north to set out as Claymore suddenly opened

568
00:31:03.10 --> 00:31:07.22
fire on full automatic, a sure sign we had visitors.

569
00:31:07.22 --> 00:31:12.30
This was immediately confirmed when heavy AK-47 fire ripped out of the jungle in response.

570
00:31:12.30 --> 00:31:18.14
In less than five seconds, the well-practiced SAU had fired off all 18 rounds in his car

571
00:31:18.14 --> 00:31:23.26
15, set off the claymores and reloaded his weapon while falling back to join the rest

572
00:31:23.26 --> 00:31:24.26
of the team.

573
00:31:24.26 --> 00:31:26.42
That's legit right there.

574
00:31:26.42 --> 00:31:28.38
SAU was making things happen.

575
00:31:28.38 --> 00:31:30.78
He was the man.

576
00:31:30.78 --> 00:31:34.38
Would you guys be trained in these immediate action drills, mag changes?

577
00:31:34.38 --> 00:31:35.54
I mean, everything that we do, right?

578
00:31:35.54 --> 00:31:36.54
You guys drill that stuff.

579
00:31:36.54 --> 00:31:37.54
Every drill in drill in drill.

580
00:31:37.54 --> 00:31:42.02
If we're in camp, we go down often.

581
00:31:42.02 --> 00:31:46.46
Just particularly in the beginning, through June, my first couple of months, whenever

582
00:31:46.46 --> 00:31:48.98
every day, hundreds of rounds.

583
00:31:48.98 --> 00:31:51.74
And when this happens, these guys are called.

584
00:31:51.74 --> 00:31:56.98
The enemy is very close to you because you can at least know that they're there.

585
00:31:56.98 --> 00:31:57.98
They've got to be what?

586
00:31:57.98 --> 00:32:00.38
15, 20, maybe 30 meters away.

587
00:32:00.38 --> 00:32:05.30
In that case here, I forget how close they weren't that far for SAU to blow his claymore

588
00:32:05.30 --> 00:32:11.74
and the car 15 and reload and do it one more time.

589
00:32:11.74 --> 00:32:12.74
Back to the book.

590
00:32:12.74 --> 00:32:16.94
Bird the background shots and explosions, so he was not overly surprised when I stated

591
00:32:16.94 --> 00:32:18.26
the obvious.

592
00:32:18.26 --> 00:32:22.50
We had a prairie fire emergency in progress and we wanted out ASAP.

593
00:32:22.50 --> 00:32:23.50
The mission was over.

594
00:32:23.50 --> 00:32:25.70
The fuel lines would have to wait until another day.

595
00:32:25.70 --> 00:32:28.50
The focus now became saving our asses.

596
00:32:28.50 --> 00:32:34.18
To this end, every air sat with air sat with in striking distance would immediately be

597
00:32:34.18 --> 00:32:36.58
vector to our target area.

598
00:32:36.58 --> 00:32:38.62
The odds would soon turn.

599
00:32:38.62 --> 00:32:42.94
If not necessarily in our favor, very decidedly against the enemy.

600
00:32:42.94 --> 00:32:53.18
RTI to ho might not make it out alive, but neither would the NVA.

601
00:32:53.18 --> 00:32:56.62
Guys had some serious confidence in that air power.

602
00:32:56.62 --> 00:32:59.30
Yeah, that was our lifeline.

603
00:32:59.30 --> 00:33:06.76
I mean, a major edge that we had and whenever we could use it, we'd use it because it was

604
00:33:06.76 --> 00:33:11.38
only matter time before they would get more bodies there and we had teams ahead been over

605
00:33:11.38 --> 00:33:15.28
run and 67, 68.

606
00:33:15.28 --> 00:33:18.84
So we knew the potential for things to go really wrong.

607
00:33:18.84 --> 00:33:23.16
That was one of the things that could neutralize the manpower.

608
00:33:23.16 --> 00:33:25.72
When they had the enemy had so many troops.

609
00:33:25.72 --> 00:33:28.44
Did teams ever get overrun while they had air power?

610
00:33:28.44 --> 00:33:30.44
Oh sure.

611
00:33:30.44 --> 00:33:32.24
Sadly, yes, we were.

612
00:33:32.24 --> 00:33:39.36
Yeah, they would just keep coming and is self-admetal honors recipients, Fred Zebattowski,

613
00:33:39.36 --> 00:33:46.52
Robert Howard, SF on admissions and they were directing air power.

614
00:33:46.52 --> 00:33:48.52
Still just got overrun.

615
00:33:48.52 --> 00:33:51.12
That's all part of the horror of being on the ground.

616
00:33:51.12 --> 00:33:53.52
We guess they really determined, Phil.

617
00:33:53.52 --> 00:33:58.16
So even though you have confidence in your air power, you know there's limitations.

618
00:33:58.16 --> 00:34:04.08
Yeah, if things really go bad, that air power is not going to be able to save you.

619
00:34:04.08 --> 00:34:05.08
Correct.

620
00:34:05.08 --> 00:34:10.28
And again, it's time, weather and where are you in the jungle?

621
00:34:10.28 --> 00:34:14.44
And a triple canopy, if you're in triple canopy, all you could do is maybe gun runs and

622
00:34:14.44 --> 00:34:21.48
you're not even sure how effective it'll be, but at least you get your attention.

623
00:34:21.48 --> 00:34:26.04
Going back to the book, call King Beast, call King Beast, Boku Vc, Boku Vc.

624
00:34:26.04 --> 00:34:30.52
It was clear, sound, and I shared similar praise of our situation and the same thoughts

625
00:34:30.52 --> 00:34:33.04
about what needed to be done.

626
00:34:33.04 --> 00:34:37.72
The only hitch was how to pull it off, what with darkness approaching a storm raging and

627
00:34:37.72 --> 00:34:40.40
no helicopters anywhere near us.

628
00:34:40.40 --> 00:34:46.56
I didn't want to add to either sounds or the team's angst, so I didn't share my misgivings.

629
00:34:46.56 --> 00:34:51.28
Instead, I gave Kovie the direction and probable distance we'd moved from the LZ and

630
00:34:51.28 --> 00:34:55.48
told him I was about to throw two yellow smoke grenades to mark a location.

631
00:34:55.48 --> 00:35:00.04
I threw two hoping some of the smoke would somehow travel up through the thick vegetation

632
00:35:00.04 --> 00:35:04.80
and into the clear where Kovie could see it.

633
00:35:04.80 --> 00:35:07.36
Kovie had good and bad news.

634
00:35:07.36 --> 00:35:12.04
He thought he had our location, but he doubted seriously if he could get extraction helicopters

635
00:35:12.04 --> 00:35:14.16
to us before nightfall.

636
00:35:14.16 --> 00:35:17.12
Not good, not good at all.

637
00:35:17.12 --> 00:35:23.12
We now had confirmed enemy north and south of us and they were closing in.

638
00:35:23.12 --> 00:35:28.40
South frantically signaled Bubba to set off the south facing Klamors when Bubba hesitated

639
00:35:28.40 --> 00:35:29.40
for a second.

640
00:35:29.40 --> 00:35:32.84
I could hear South his coat of Kovie-Dow-VC.

641
00:35:32.84 --> 00:35:34.16
How do you say that?

642
00:35:34.16 --> 00:35:35.16
Kovie-Dow-VC.

643
00:35:35.16 --> 00:35:38.88
Do you mean the misrecill?

644
00:35:38.88 --> 00:35:47.000
Duma, which is Vietnamese for mother, mother fuckers.

645
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.32
As the Klamors erupted, South pulled the pin on the fragmentation grenade and lobbed it

646
00:35:51.32 --> 00:35:57.64
into the boiling dust and smoke even more enemy troops came up the slope.

647
00:35:57.64 --> 00:36:02.36
With my ears ringing from the blast, I thought I heard additional movement to the east,

648
00:36:02.36 --> 00:36:03.88
but I couldn't be sure.

649
00:36:03.88 --> 00:36:09.36
Because the NVA had abandoned any pretense of stealth, I soon verified they were coming

650
00:36:09.36 --> 00:36:11.24
from that flank as well.

651
00:36:11.24 --> 00:36:13.000
And there were lots of them.

652
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.20
As these unseen forces maneuvered in for the kill, the jungle took on its most terrifying

653
00:36:18.20 --> 00:36:20.60
and claustrophobic reality.

654
00:36:20.60 --> 00:36:26.000
But a friendly place in the very best of circumstances, it was now about the worst place

655
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.76
in the world to be.

656
00:36:29.76 --> 00:36:33.32
Again, that claustrophobic sense.

657
00:36:33.32 --> 00:36:38.68
Can you see the sky in the stripple canopy?

658
00:36:38.68 --> 00:36:43.80
Depends, sometimes you can see it glimpses of it or it would be a little opening.

659
00:36:43.80 --> 00:36:48.000
So he was able to see the smoke, sometimes you pop a yellow smoke, which is bright, and

660
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.52
wouldn't even be able to get through.

661
00:36:53.52 --> 00:36:57.24
Everyone was cutting loose as fast as he could and effort to suppress the enemy's fire

662
00:36:57.24 --> 00:36:58.52
and drive him back.

663
00:36:58.52 --> 00:37:02.84
Twanted managed to find some narrow openings in the vegetation that were shooting rounds

664
00:37:02.84 --> 00:37:06.16
with his M79 grenade launcher.

665
00:37:06.16 --> 00:37:07.80
And suddenly the jungle went silent.

666
00:37:07.80 --> 00:37:13.16
As if someone had thrown a switch or hit the mute button, the only sounds were the metallic

667
00:37:13.16 --> 00:37:20.40
clicks as both RT Idaho and the NVA locked fresh magazines into their weapons.

668
00:37:20.40 --> 00:37:22.20
The fight was far from over.

669
00:37:22.20 --> 00:37:27.02
In fact, the party was just getting started and we were simply changing records for the

670
00:37:27.02 --> 00:37:29.72
next dance with death.

671
00:37:29.72 --> 00:37:37.04
The jungle again erupted with deafening roar of gunfire.

672
00:37:37.04 --> 00:37:38.52
So that's sketchy.

673
00:37:38.52 --> 00:37:40.12
That's got to be a horrifying feeling.

674
00:37:40.12 --> 00:37:41.12
Boom.

675
00:37:41.12 --> 00:37:43.12
That's why everyone dumps their mags.

676
00:37:43.12 --> 00:37:46.60
There's that moment of silence and then that silence, all you hear is reload happening.

677
00:37:46.60 --> 00:37:51.36
And you know too, when that happens, how when your adrenaline is pumping, when you're

678
00:37:51.36 --> 00:37:55.000
here, your time frame has expanded.

679
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.20
So now instead of like, you just read it, that's a quick, it is bam bam, you're saying,

680
00:37:59.20 --> 00:38:02.60
but now, and then you're drowning, it feels like it's slowed down.

681
00:38:02.60 --> 00:38:04.72
You can feel the magazine coming out.

682
00:38:04.72 --> 00:38:07.80
You hear it click, click, everybody else is ramming them in.

683
00:38:07.80 --> 00:38:08.80
Come on, boys.

684
00:38:08.80 --> 00:38:12.92
Come down on this first and our guys won.

685
00:38:12.92 --> 00:38:18.52
With all the noise, I had to shove the radio handset, damn near, inside my ear to hear what

686
00:38:18.52 --> 00:38:20.56
Kofi was trying to tell me.

687
00:38:20.56 --> 00:38:23.16
The good news bad news routine continued.

688
00:38:23.16 --> 00:38:26.84
The good news was that some of the yellow smoke had finally made it, it's way to where

689
00:38:26.84 --> 00:38:28.32
Kofi could see it.

690
00:38:28.32 --> 00:38:32.20
But the bad news was we were nowhere near the NLZ.

691
00:38:32.20 --> 00:38:36.28
He wanted to know if we could fight our way back to where we had been inserted.

692
00:38:36.28 --> 00:38:42.24
Negative, I yelled as fuck, Bubba, and Hap all opened up on some NVA who had managed to sneak

693
00:38:42.24 --> 00:38:43.92
up from the south.

694
00:38:43.92 --> 00:38:47.000
There were green tracers whizzing all around me.

695
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.44
Kofi would have to wait.

696
00:38:48.44 --> 00:38:54.96
And that's another good point because in this war, the enemy almost always had green

697
00:38:54.96 --> 00:38:55.96
tracers.

698
00:38:55.96 --> 00:38:56.96
Always.

699
00:38:56.96 --> 00:38:57.96
Okay.

700
00:38:57.96 --> 00:38:58.96
Yeah, for us, the enemy didn't always have green.

701
00:38:58.96 --> 00:38:59.96
They've had red.

702
00:38:59.96 --> 00:39:02.64
In fact, most of the time, well, a lot of times I had red.

703
00:39:02.64 --> 00:39:03.64
Because they had.

704
00:39:03.64 --> 00:39:04.64
Well, no kidding.

705
00:39:04.64 --> 00:39:05.64
Yeah.

706
00:39:05.64 --> 00:39:09.96
So it was, you know, they just got their ammo from all different sources.

707
00:39:09.96 --> 00:39:13.52
And so it wasn't just this, there wasn't just, hey, they're green and we're red.

708
00:39:13.52 --> 00:39:15.80
It was mostly red.

709
00:39:15.80 --> 00:39:17.16
Some green occasionally, but.

710
00:39:17.16 --> 00:39:18.16
Wow.

711
00:39:18.16 --> 00:39:19.16
Yeah.

712
00:39:19.16 --> 00:39:20.16
Yeah.

713
00:39:20.16 --> 00:39:24.36
Um.

714
00:39:24.36 --> 00:39:30.56
After helping repel the attack, I got back on the radio to impress upon Kofi, the direness of our

715
00:39:30.56 --> 00:39:31.56
straits.

716
00:39:31.56 --> 00:39:32.88
But of course, he already knew that.

717
00:39:32.88 --> 00:39:37.28
So in his convoyce, which could drive a one zero to a merger, he said, we don't have

718
00:39:37.28 --> 00:39:38.28
a lot of time.

719
00:39:38.28 --> 00:39:40.12
No shit.

720
00:39:40.12 --> 00:39:43.76
The only chance we have is about a hundred meters north by northeast from your location.

721
00:39:43.76 --> 00:39:47.72
There's a small hole in the roof, and we might be able to get strings down to you.

722
00:39:47.72 --> 00:39:50.76
He inquired if we had much activity to our north.

723
00:39:50.76 --> 00:39:53.44
It depended, I thought, on what you meant by much.

724
00:39:53.44 --> 00:39:55.44
And activity.

725
00:39:55.44 --> 00:40:00.20
I reminded him that north was where the whole shooting match got started and while the

726
00:40:00.20 --> 00:40:05.16
bullet, while I thought we had pretty much taken that group of NVA out of action, I couldn't

727
00:40:05.16 --> 00:40:06.32
be sure.

728
00:40:06.32 --> 00:40:08.36
When I finished, he said, don't worry.

729
00:40:08.36 --> 00:40:13.76
I have a pair of A1E's on station, and I'll have the leader make a gun run, and then

730
00:40:13.76 --> 00:40:18.24
give, and then have his wingmen follow with 500 pounders.

731
00:40:18.24 --> 00:40:22.16
Before I could say, Roger that the first guy radar roared across our northern perimeter,

732
00:40:22.16 --> 00:40:24.92
his 20 millimeter cannons blazing away.

733
00:40:24.92 --> 00:40:30.88
His wood chips dust and debris filled the air, the members of RTI Idaho did not need to

734
00:40:30.88 --> 00:40:32.24
be told what to do.

735
00:40:32.24 --> 00:40:37.56
We kissed mother earth and pressed against her body for all we were worth.

736
00:40:37.56 --> 00:40:41.96
In the brief quiet that followed, I told Bubba to pair some explosives.

737
00:40:41.96 --> 00:40:45.000
Just in case we needed to cut down trees at the extraction point.

738
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.32
I told Sau, we needed to head north as that was our only chance for escape.

739
00:40:49.32 --> 00:40:54.88
No one looked happy with this news, particularly not Sau, who had seen first hand

740
00:40:54.88 --> 00:40:57.68
what was waiting in that direction.

741
00:40:57.68 --> 00:41:03.52
About this time, the second sky radar appeared and released its load of 500 pound bombs.

742
00:41:03.52 --> 00:41:11.44
They were so close that the concussions bounced us like jumping beans.

743
00:41:11.44 --> 00:41:16.48
And this is all based on the yellow smoke that you'd thrown five minutes ago or eight

744
00:41:16.48 --> 00:41:17.48
minutes ago.

745
00:41:17.48 --> 00:41:18.48
Right.

746
00:41:18.48 --> 00:41:22.88
They're looking at a massive, this is another thing that's hard to understand.

747
00:41:22.88 --> 00:41:27.68
I was a radio man when I was in New Guy and we were out in the desert and we were trying

748
00:41:27.68 --> 00:41:30.92
to call in helicopters to come pick us up.

749
00:41:30.92 --> 00:41:31.92
It's me calling him in.

750
00:41:31.92 --> 00:41:32.92
It's not weed.

751
00:41:32.92 --> 00:41:36.12
I'm sitting there on the radio trying to call in these helicopters.

752
00:41:36.12 --> 00:41:39.32
I got my air pan and we're in the desert.

753
00:41:39.32 --> 00:41:43.12
This isn't true because this is the desert and these helicopters can't see me.

754
00:41:43.12 --> 00:41:44.12
They're not far.

755
00:41:44.12 --> 00:41:45.12
They're not out to do.

756
00:41:45.12 --> 00:41:48.12
They're probably 500 to 500 meters away.

757
00:41:48.12 --> 00:41:52.20
They're doing an apathy earth or they're looking for us.

758
00:41:52.20 --> 00:41:54.72
They know we're in the general area and they're looking for us and I'm sitting there with

759
00:41:54.72 --> 00:41:58.64
a signal panel like trying to get their attention.

760
00:41:58.64 --> 00:42:03.64
And what you don't realize is that you're seeing this helicopter.

761
00:42:03.64 --> 00:42:04.64
It's so obvious.

762
00:42:04.64 --> 00:42:07.68
I mean, you'd think there's no possible way that they can't see you.

763
00:42:07.68 --> 00:42:12.12
You'd think there's no pop where you've got a 16 man seal puttune out there.

764
00:42:12.12 --> 00:42:16.36
I'm waving around a piece of fluorescent orange where the only human beings in this desert

765
00:42:16.36 --> 00:42:18.32
and they can't see us.

766
00:42:18.32 --> 00:42:22.28
And now you're in the reason they can't see us is because they're looking everywhere.

767
00:42:22.28 --> 00:42:23.76
They're looking at whatever.

768
00:42:23.76 --> 00:42:26.24
What however many square miles they're looking into and ocean.

769
00:42:26.24 --> 00:42:27.24
They're looking at the desert.

770
00:42:27.24 --> 00:42:30.04
They can see all this space.

771
00:42:30.04 --> 00:42:31.04
And so it takes them a while.

772
00:42:31.04 --> 00:42:32.04
You don't find that.

773
00:42:32.04 --> 00:42:37.64
I think I popped a smoke and they didn't see the smoke and then I popped another smoke.

774
00:42:37.64 --> 00:42:45.68
And so I can't imagine these guys are coming in hot, dropping bombs based on where the

775
00:42:45.68 --> 00:42:51.40
not even the him but where the covey saw smoke five minutes ago.

776
00:42:51.40 --> 00:42:52.40
Yeah.

777
00:42:52.40 --> 00:42:57.12
We may have popped another smoke in here somewhere and also I know that I had talked

778
00:42:57.12 --> 00:42:58.12
to covey.

779
00:42:58.12 --> 00:43:03.96
Okay, here's our smoke north of us and he knew they had we had a lot of I take north

780
00:43:03.96 --> 00:43:08.96
in south and if we got about maybe we'll be we're getting from the east but if we're

781
00:43:08.96 --> 00:43:12.80
talking about trying to get to the north that's why he came across the northern.

782
00:43:12.80 --> 00:43:16.76
So he knew basically where we were and he came in and it cost a 500 pounds of

783
00:43:16.76 --> 00:43:20.64
able to get through the jungle and impact on the ground.

784
00:43:20.64 --> 00:43:22.24
And those things rocked you guys.

785
00:43:22.24 --> 00:43:23.24
Oh yeah.

786
00:43:23.24 --> 00:43:29.000
That's one of those happy pains.

787
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Yeah.

788
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.92
Good times I guess.

789
00:43:33.92 --> 00:43:34.92
Tilt.

790
00:43:34.92 --> 00:43:36.88
All right.

791
00:43:36.88 --> 00:43:42.40
With the A1E activity to occupy us we had momentarily taken our attention away from our

792
00:43:42.40 --> 00:43:47.28
southern flank and now a wave of NVA hit us from that direction.

793
00:43:47.28 --> 00:43:53.88
Everyone responded with automatic fire and Bubba and I lob some grenades down the slope.

794
00:43:53.88 --> 00:43:58.96
I informed covey of the attack and told him that when I gave the word and the team moved

795
00:43:58.96 --> 00:44:02.88
to the north I wanted more A1E runs to our south.

796
00:44:02.88 --> 00:44:07.32
In my heart of hearts I also wanted more runs to the north but we didn't have time for

797
00:44:07.32 --> 00:44:08.32
that.

798
00:44:08.32 --> 00:44:10.76
We had to get out while the getting was good.

799
00:44:10.76 --> 00:44:20.68
The next NVA wave could be the one to overrun us.

800
00:44:20.68 --> 00:44:25.28
As Bubba finished preparing explosives, Hep and I continued rolling grenades downhill

801
00:44:25.28 --> 00:44:26.76
toward the enemy.

802
00:44:26.76 --> 00:44:32.60
Saoen folk covered Tuan with car 15 fire as he set up a clay more facing south and covered

803
00:44:32.60 --> 00:44:33.76
it with leaves.

804
00:44:33.76 --> 00:44:38.40
A little parting gift for our friends.

805
00:44:38.40 --> 00:44:39.52
The race was on.

806
00:44:39.52 --> 00:44:42.56
I gave covey the word and behind us the A1E.

807
00:44:42.56 --> 00:44:46.04
The A1E is began bombing the shit out of whoever was back there.

808
00:44:46.04 --> 00:44:47.72
Folk angled back to the north.

809
00:44:47.72 --> 00:44:51.88
We passed the, we passed bodies of dead NVA soldiers but we didn't have time to stop and

810
00:44:51.88 --> 00:44:55.68
search them for papers or anything of an intelligence value.

811
00:44:55.68 --> 00:44:58.000
We had only one fought mind.

812
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Get out.

813
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.32
It was something of a miracle that fawking Sao actually located the spot covey had found

814
00:45:04.32 --> 00:45:05.80
for us.

815
00:45:05.80 --> 00:45:10.48
When we finally looked up toward the whole itself however, it appeared a long, long ways

816
00:45:10.48 --> 00:45:11.48
away.

817
00:45:11.48 --> 00:45:15.20
It was at least a hundred feet or more and the green tunnel leading to it was narrow and

818
00:45:15.20 --> 00:45:16.20
dangerous.

819
00:45:16.20 --> 00:45:20.48
As we were approaching, I'd seen the tops of trees being whipped around by the gusting

820
00:45:20.48 --> 00:45:24.92
wind and knew this would complicate matters even more.

821
00:45:24.92 --> 00:45:26.56
This was not going to be an easy exit.

822
00:45:26.56 --> 00:45:27.84
So you guys are moving to this thing.

823
00:45:27.84 --> 00:45:30.24
You're looking up at the tree tops and you see there's like heavy wind.

824
00:45:30.24 --> 00:45:32.48
Because that's just a weather wind.

825
00:45:32.48 --> 00:45:33.48
Like it's wet.

826
00:45:33.48 --> 00:45:34.48
It's windy out.

827
00:45:34.48 --> 00:45:39.12
We had weather forecast and it might be some problems with the weather.

828
00:45:39.12 --> 00:45:43.12
So here we are as dark and I didn't tell the guys.

829
00:45:43.12 --> 00:45:48.000
I knew that seeing those trees like that, this was a little bit.

830
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.64
And I was getting late dark.

831
00:45:50.64 --> 00:45:52.48
I needed your nugs.

832
00:45:52.48 --> 00:45:53.48
Yeah, you did.

833
00:45:53.48 --> 00:45:55.48
I wish you could have had them bro.

834
00:45:55.48 --> 00:45:57.68
And we're going to totally change this whole scenario.

835
00:45:57.68 --> 00:46:00.36
Because the helicopter, because the aircraft too.

836
00:46:00.36 --> 00:46:01.36
Sure.

837
00:46:01.36 --> 00:46:02.92
Because the aircraft would be, oh yeah, we got you.

838
00:46:02.92 --> 00:46:06.80
We got you locked and we'll just, you guys can just pitch a ten.

839
00:46:06.80 --> 00:46:07.80
Pick the first one.

840
00:46:07.80 --> 00:46:12.08
Pick the first one.

841
00:46:12.08 --> 00:46:18.12
And the NVA, this still, you know, the big motto of the insurgents, right, is that they

842
00:46:18.12 --> 00:46:20.92
only fight when they want to and they don't have to fight if they don't need to.

843
00:46:20.92 --> 00:46:29.92
And you don't imagine troops that don't have to fight, just keep coming after you.

844
00:46:29.92 --> 00:46:34.16
Just keep, you're laying waste on, but they keep coming.

845
00:46:34.16 --> 00:46:40.92
That must to be the value of capturing you all cross border would be so high that they

846
00:46:40.92 --> 00:46:45.36
just must have had serious intent to try and capture.

847
00:46:45.36 --> 00:46:49.56
Well yeah, and then too, you know, you had that propaganda they've been fed for all those

848
00:46:49.56 --> 00:46:50.56
years.

849
00:46:50.56 --> 00:46:55.40
They really believed that like the French, we were there to occupy.

850
00:46:55.40 --> 00:47:01.12
So we're just there was combatting communism, but they never hurt any of that stuff.

851
00:47:01.12 --> 00:47:02.12
And they were dedicated.

852
00:47:02.12 --> 00:47:06.92
That's absolutely, yes, sir.

853
00:47:06.92 --> 00:47:09.92
Back to the book, the NVA had not given up.

854
00:47:09.92 --> 00:47:14.12
Its troops were hot on our tail, even though we had heard Tuan's claim or go off and

855
00:47:14.12 --> 00:47:17.92
had listened to the A1E's work them over.

856
00:47:17.92 --> 00:47:20.04
You had to hand it to the NVA soldiers.

857
00:47:20.04 --> 00:47:22.32
They were very tough and determined.

858
00:47:22.32 --> 00:47:31.12
I again contacted Kovie and asked for some tactical air command air support to our rear.

859
00:47:31.12 --> 00:47:35.88
And in a matter of minutes, bombs were falling and cannons were blasting away.

860
00:47:35.88 --> 00:47:40.76
I'm sure I was impressed with the service as the NVA were surprised by how quickly the

861
00:47:40.76 --> 00:47:42.76
ordinance had been delivered.

862
00:47:42.76 --> 00:47:44.64
They were learning less in the hard way.

863
00:47:44.64 --> 00:47:49.52
If a recon team wasn't wiped out in the first few minutes of the fight, the NVA would

864
00:47:49.52 --> 00:47:57.04
pay dearly for the mistake, but more than one NVA unit had experienced this firsthand.

865
00:47:57.04 --> 00:48:02.60
So that's kind of a critical few minutes as long as it's long to take for air to get

866
00:48:02.60 --> 00:48:03.60
on station usually.

867
00:48:03.60 --> 00:48:05.40
Well, it depends every time.

868
00:48:05.40 --> 00:48:11.56
Several hours to, in this case, we were fortunate to make contact really early on with

869
00:48:11.56 --> 00:48:17.44
Kovie, who fortunately had A1E's that were within a few minutes away.

870
00:48:17.44 --> 00:48:19.04
So there were some lock involved.

871
00:48:19.04 --> 00:48:20.04
Very much.

872
00:48:20.04 --> 00:48:23.12
I mean, we solved them, had that kind of response and lay us.

873
00:48:23.12 --> 00:48:27.12
Did you ever pre-plan to have coverage at certain times?

874
00:48:27.12 --> 00:48:28.76
It would be a special mission.

875
00:48:28.76 --> 00:48:33.92
Like the ones we put in the sensors, you put them in and you're going to be an account

876
00:48:33.92 --> 00:48:35.44
for two or three hours.

877
00:48:35.44 --> 00:48:38.52
He booked the times, had the asset set.

878
00:48:38.52 --> 00:48:42.56
So we have to go or something happens in between being you think come in.

879
00:48:42.56 --> 00:48:48.96
But most of the time, were these aircraft necessarily briefed on the mission?

880
00:48:48.96 --> 00:48:49.96
That's self.

881
00:48:49.96 --> 00:48:51.56
So do they know coming in?

882
00:48:51.56 --> 00:48:52.68
Hey, this is the a.o.

883
00:48:52.68 --> 00:48:53.68
That they're working.

884
00:48:53.68 --> 00:48:54.68
Oh, these guys just coming in.

885
00:48:54.68 --> 00:48:56.68
They were just random pilots.

886
00:48:56.68 --> 00:48:58.000
It would be both.

887
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:05.12
They had specific A1 units in the Air Force in that timeframe that were specifically

888
00:49:05.12 --> 00:49:11.96
their for sog missions and SAR, search and rescue up north for any down pilots.

889
00:49:11.96 --> 00:49:18.64
So they were very much attuned to our people, working with contune and with us up north.

890
00:49:18.64 --> 00:49:23.64
So they knew everything was in the Prairie Fire A.

891
00:49:23.64 --> 00:49:30.60
Sometimes when we were in Echo 4, our first contact was with a fighter jet that heard the

892
00:49:30.60 --> 00:49:34.96
Erkten beeper and responded to that.

893
00:49:34.96 --> 00:49:39.24
So another mission is another aircraft would hear it.

894
00:49:39.24 --> 00:49:46.04
And if they had an ordinance, then we had to get the myriad, get them locate and find

895
00:49:46.04 --> 00:49:51.92
us and bring in the ordinance while he put the call out to get the cover or the Hillsboro

896
00:49:51.92 --> 00:49:58.60
or Moonbeam, to let the node head a tactical emergency going on here.

897
00:49:58.60 --> 00:50:01.96
And you're doing all that on the radio while you're still fighting.

898
00:50:01.96 --> 00:50:07.28
Yeah, we had to spend a few rounds there.

899
00:50:07.28 --> 00:50:09.28
Lighten the load.

900
00:50:09.28 --> 00:50:15.22
All right, Bubba, Sout and Falk had been busy placing explosive charges on trees while

901
00:50:15.22 --> 00:50:17.96
hepp and Tuan set out claim worse facing south.

902
00:50:17.96 --> 00:50:25.02
I couldn't help but shake my head in wonder at hepp in a dark jungle with night approaching.

903
00:50:25.02 --> 00:50:28.14
He still had his ever present sunglasses.

904
00:50:28.14 --> 00:50:31.78
We blew the charges around the trees and they were cut clean, but the dense jungle refused

905
00:50:31.78 --> 00:50:33.54
to let them fall.

906
00:50:33.54 --> 00:50:35.98
We had not succeeded in making the whole any bigger.

907
00:50:35.98 --> 00:50:40.74
So we just have to hope the rescue ships could manage to drop the ropes down to us and

908
00:50:40.74 --> 00:50:42.26
then pray the ropes were long enough.

909
00:50:42.26 --> 00:50:46.06
So you're trying to make that hole in the jungle a little bit bigger.

910
00:50:46.06 --> 00:50:49.06
Like what diameter is this hole that you're looking at?

911
00:50:49.06 --> 00:50:52.86
Oh, this is like 10 meters is it not that.

912
00:50:52.86 --> 00:50:54.78
You know, it's a good question.

913
00:50:54.78 --> 00:50:55.78
Maybe 20, 30 meters.

914
00:50:55.78 --> 00:50:56.78
Okay.

915
00:50:56.78 --> 00:50:58.18
At the most, but there's trees in it.

916
00:50:58.18 --> 00:50:59.18
Yeah.

917
00:50:59.18 --> 00:51:04.34
No, it's, this is a little bit more open as opposed to just triple canopy enclosed where

918
00:51:04.34 --> 00:51:06.26
you're just completely, we could see skylight.

919
00:51:06.26 --> 00:51:08.26
You could literally see the sky.

920
00:51:08.26 --> 00:51:10.98
But and then you try and blow some of the trees.

921
00:51:10.98 --> 00:51:12.86
They don't even fall down because there's too much jungle.

922
00:51:12.86 --> 00:51:13.86
Two lines.

923
00:51:13.86 --> 00:51:14.86
Yeah, two.

924
00:51:14.86 --> 00:51:15.86
Two trees.

925
00:51:15.86 --> 00:51:16.86
It doesn't even help.

926
00:51:16.86 --> 00:51:17.86
Good.

927
00:51:17.86 --> 00:51:18.86
Dimes.

928
00:51:18.86 --> 00:51:22.10
And to the frustration.

929
00:51:22.10 --> 00:51:27.30
We tried to blow up some palm trees or actually was leaf, leafs, puttune, tried to blow

930
00:51:27.30 --> 00:51:32.74
up some palm trees that were obstructing their view in a Overwatch position.

931
00:51:32.74 --> 00:51:33.74
Right.

932
00:51:33.74 --> 00:51:37.10
And they blew up.

933
00:51:37.10 --> 00:51:40.22
They said they sit so many charges on these palm trees.

934
00:51:40.22 --> 00:51:41.22
It was embarrassing.

935
00:51:41.22 --> 00:51:42.22
I got rung.

936
00:51:42.22 --> 00:51:43.22
I got rung.

937
00:51:43.22 --> 00:51:44.22
No, they weren't.

938
00:51:44.22 --> 00:51:45.22
They didn't budge.

939
00:51:45.22 --> 00:51:46.22
No, I got embarrassed.

940
00:51:46.22 --> 00:51:48.94
I'm sitting there telling the batiling commander.

941
00:51:48.94 --> 00:51:51.42
He's saying, well, I'm saying, Heather, sir, there's going to be another controlled

942
00:51:51.42 --> 00:51:52.42
debt and boom.

943
00:51:52.42 --> 00:51:54.90
And then something's going to be another controlled debt and then boom.

944
00:51:54.90 --> 00:51:57.02
And then something's going to be another controlled debt and then boom.

945
00:51:57.02 --> 00:51:58.42
He said, what are they doing?

946
00:51:58.42 --> 00:51:59.42
I said, it's a good word.

947
00:51:59.42 --> 00:52:00.42
It's a palm tree.

948
00:52:00.42 --> 00:52:01.42
He's don't worry about it.

949
00:52:01.42 --> 00:52:02.42
You know, what's there?

950
00:52:02.42 --> 00:52:03.42
We're just going to leave those palm trees.

951
00:52:03.42 --> 00:52:06.22
Yeah, the score right now is palm trees three seals.

952
00:52:06.22 --> 00:52:08.22
Yeah, that's what happened.

953
00:52:08.22 --> 00:52:11.42
Oh, no, those palm trees are hard.

954
00:52:11.42 --> 00:52:12.42
Resilient.

955
00:52:12.42 --> 00:52:13.42
Thick.

956
00:52:13.42 --> 00:52:14.42
All right.

957
00:52:14.42 --> 00:52:15.42
Back to the book.

958
00:52:15.42 --> 00:52:18.22
With the helicopters on their final approach, I threw out another smoke grenade

959
00:52:18.22 --> 00:52:22.18
to mark our location and the rest of the team began firing at the NVA who had again

960
00:52:22.18 --> 00:52:23.58
pressed in on us.

961
00:52:23.58 --> 00:52:28.46
We could barely make out their shadows, but they were definitely out there as evidence

962
00:52:28.46 --> 00:52:31.66
by the green trace around flying towards us.

963
00:52:31.66 --> 00:52:34.26
Covey hadn't been able to see my smoke.

964
00:52:34.26 --> 00:52:36.30
So he asked for a pen flare.

965
00:52:36.30 --> 00:52:38.34
And I tried to fire it up through the trees.

966
00:52:38.34 --> 00:52:40.94
It struck a limb and bounced back.

967
00:52:40.94 --> 00:52:45.62
Being desperate, I told Covey I was going to shoot three trace around, red trace around

968
00:52:45.62 --> 00:52:47.18
up through the hole.

969
00:52:47.18 --> 00:52:50.86
And before he could scream, no, I had pulled the trigger on my car 15.

970
00:52:50.86 --> 00:52:55.62
I immediately realized what a dangerous move it was as I saw him pass overhead.

971
00:52:55.62 --> 00:53:00.38
In case there was any doubt in my mind, Covey took the time to let me know in no unsuit

972
00:53:00.38 --> 00:53:02.14
in terms how stupid I was.

973
00:53:02.14 --> 00:53:06.94
I believe the expressions dumb asked and shit for brains came into play.

974
00:53:06.94 --> 00:53:09.58
Well, me.

975
00:53:09.58 --> 00:53:10.82
So you're in this situation.

976
00:53:10.82 --> 00:53:13.22
He still took the time to call you shit for brains.

977
00:53:13.22 --> 00:53:15.66
You're about to die.

978
00:53:15.66 --> 00:53:18.46
Pry, oh man.

979
00:53:18.46 --> 00:53:19.46
Yeah.

980
00:53:19.46 --> 00:53:20.46
And you know what's thinking?

981
00:53:20.46 --> 00:53:21.46
I never fought in Afghanistan.

982
00:53:21.46 --> 00:53:22.46
I don't know what they had.

983
00:53:22.46 --> 00:53:24.46
I don't know if they saw a lot of more green traceers over there.

984
00:53:24.46 --> 00:53:29.54
I'll have to ask some of them and buddies and never really thought about that.

985
00:53:29.54 --> 00:53:32.74
So that's a, was that just like the normal little pencil flare?

986
00:53:32.74 --> 00:53:33.74
Yes.

987
00:53:33.74 --> 00:53:34.74
A little trigger thing.

988
00:53:34.74 --> 00:53:35.74
You put crink.

989
00:53:35.74 --> 00:53:37.98
It's always like a 22 round that fires up its tracer.

990
00:53:37.98 --> 00:53:38.98
Yes.

991
00:53:38.98 --> 00:53:40.70
I didn't penetrate through.

992
00:53:40.70 --> 00:53:44.42
So you decide you're just going to fire the car.

993
00:53:44.42 --> 00:53:45.90
But all my tracers.

994
00:53:45.90 --> 00:53:46.90
But they saw him, right?

995
00:53:46.90 --> 00:53:47.90
They did.

996
00:53:47.90 --> 00:53:48.90
Yeah.

997
00:53:48.90 --> 00:53:53.06
So, hey, one for till.

998
00:53:53.06 --> 00:53:56.74
Just before the rescue choppers attempted to hover and drop the ropes, I told Covey I wanted

999
00:53:56.74 --> 00:54:01.38
the gunships that accompanied them to work over the area around us, particularly to the south.

1000
00:54:01.38 --> 00:54:05.14
I wanted the NVA to be either dead wounded or with their heads buried in the ground, who

1001
00:54:05.14 --> 00:54:06.98
we tried to make our escape.

1002
00:54:06.98 --> 00:54:12.94
The muskets, the men from the 176 assault helicopter company immediately went to work

1003
00:54:12.94 --> 00:54:19.62
with their 2.75 inch rockets and their gattling like mini guns, multi-barled weapons that

1004
00:54:19.62 --> 00:54:23.62
could pump 6,000 rounds of 7,6 to a minute.

1005
00:54:23.62 --> 00:54:28.02
As the last rocket hit and exploded behind us, the first 100 first airborne division

1006
00:54:28.02 --> 00:54:32.14
slick appeared over the hole in the jungle roof and dropped sandbags with ropes attached

1007
00:54:32.14 --> 00:54:33.14
to them.

1008
00:54:33.14 --> 00:54:38.14
The helicopter was so high up that looked like a toy and even its powerful rotor wash

1009
00:54:38.14 --> 00:54:39.86
couldn't reach us.

1010
00:54:39.86 --> 00:54:43.58
I could tell he wasn't being buffeted by the wind, but he had somehow managed to hold

1011
00:54:43.58 --> 00:54:45.78
steady over the opening.

1012
00:54:45.78 --> 00:54:49.82
One of the sandbags attached to the rope had a strobe light attached to it and we watched

1013
00:54:49.82 --> 00:54:53.30
it bounce off the limbs as it fell toward us.

1014
00:54:53.30 --> 00:54:59.82
You guys I guess they had invented the jungle penetrator yet.

1015
00:54:59.82 --> 00:55:02.38
They have but not on UEs.

1016
00:55:02.38 --> 00:55:05.66
They had them on the HH3s and the job means giant.

1017
00:55:05.66 --> 00:55:10.70
Yeah, for the other reason, they don't know it's like a big metal, yeah, jungle penetrator.

1018
00:55:10.70 --> 00:55:13.38
It's a big metal kind of spear almost.

1019
00:55:13.38 --> 00:55:19.18
And they've still able to talk to a crane and it just drops down and that weight and

1020
00:55:19.18 --> 00:55:20.34
it's well shaped.

1021
00:55:20.34 --> 00:55:26.02
As opposed to just a random sandbag bouncing in here.

1022
00:55:26.02 --> 00:55:30.86
And so this thing was hot, this thing must have been like 150 feet up.

1023
00:55:30.86 --> 00:55:33.86
Yeah, they had the longest ropes in there.

1024
00:55:33.86 --> 00:55:39.10
Surprise even got down to us.

1025
00:55:39.10 --> 00:55:42.86
Back to the book while we kept an eye on the ropes descending through the trees, the NVA mounted

1026
00:55:42.86 --> 00:55:44.98
a desperate last charge towards us.

1027
00:55:44.98 --> 00:55:50.58
We walked along and hept, triggered their claymores and the rest of us opened up with all we had.

1028
00:55:50.58 --> 00:55:55.86
Somehow in the midst of all the tumultuous activity, the four in-ditch had managed to rig

1029
00:55:55.86 --> 00:56:00.14
themselves a Swiss seat using the six foot long pieces of rope we carried just for that

1030
00:56:00.14 --> 00:56:01.14
purpose.

1031
00:56:01.14 --> 00:56:05.26
Bubba and I now tried to do the same but it wasn't easy to wrap a rope around my waist,

1032
00:56:05.26 --> 00:56:09.78
pass it between my legs and then finish tying it off on the right hip while under fire.

1033
00:56:09.78 --> 00:56:15.58
We managed to do it while the inditch held off the enemy and began to hook up for the left

1034
00:56:15.58 --> 00:56:16.58
out.

1035
00:56:16.58 --> 00:56:23.98
If you guys ever think about using some kind of pre-rigged like sit harness or something,

1036
00:56:23.98 --> 00:56:27.02
they were developing those at the time.

1037
00:56:27.02 --> 00:56:32.46
They upgraded the head like the McGuire rig, which is just basically a thick material

1038
00:56:32.46 --> 00:56:37.10
that you could sit in and hook in and then later it came out with the rig.

1039
00:56:37.10 --> 00:56:42.54
I can't think of name but it was an outfit where you had your harness built in.

1040
00:56:42.54 --> 00:56:47.30
You had to web gear with the harness so when it came down you just hook in.

1041
00:56:47.30 --> 00:56:48.30
Click in you ready?

1042
00:56:48.30 --> 00:56:50.30
I'd be thinking about that in a single while.

1043
00:56:50.30 --> 00:56:51.30
It's a lot.

1044
00:56:51.30 --> 00:56:55.30
When I found this you tried to tie a Swiss seat.

1045
00:56:55.30 --> 00:57:00.78
Yeah, that's awesome.

1046
00:57:00.78 --> 00:57:03.62
We were getting low on ammunition, grenades and claymores.

1047
00:57:03.62 --> 00:57:06.62
If we didn't make it out, it was going to be a very long night.

1048
00:57:06.62 --> 00:57:11.62
In fact, I wasn't sure if we could survive the night no matter what kind of air support

1049
00:57:11.62 --> 00:57:13.06
man is to reach us.

1050
00:57:13.06 --> 00:57:15.94
It was now or never.

1051
00:57:15.94 --> 00:57:21.30
Sound fork located three of the four ropes and it attached themselves to one of them using

1052
00:57:21.30 --> 00:57:22.66
snap links.

1053
00:57:22.66 --> 00:57:26.58
When I asked a cubby if the chopper could lift us all out of once, he replied, no way, it's

1054
00:57:26.58 --> 00:57:28.50
going to take two lifts.

1055
00:57:28.50 --> 00:57:31.14
No way is exactly what I thought in return.

1056
00:57:31.14 --> 00:57:33.98
There was no way we had enough time for two attempts.

1057
00:57:33.98 --> 00:57:36.30
There was no way I was going to split the team.

1058
00:57:36.30 --> 00:57:39.42
Either all six of us were going out together on four ropes.

1059
00:57:39.42 --> 00:57:42.50
Oh, we were going to die together trying.

1060
00:57:42.50 --> 00:57:46.22
Call it camaraderie or fear, but I was not going to leave anyone.

1061
00:57:46.22 --> 00:57:50.14
Myself included on the ground for a minute longer than necessary.

1062
00:57:50.14 --> 00:57:55.30
I'd heard all the horror stories I needed to about what could result in and I didn't want

1063
00:57:55.30 --> 00:58:00.34
to be the subject of some gruesome tale around the bar at F.O.B.1.

1064
00:58:00.34 --> 00:58:05.10
I suddenly had a bright idea and asked Bubba if he still had the claim or with the white

1065
00:58:05.10 --> 00:58:07.78
phosphorus grenade taped to its front.

1066
00:58:07.78 --> 00:58:12.46
When he nodded, yes, I told him to strap it as high as he could as high as he could reach

1067
00:58:12.46 --> 00:58:14.74
on a nearby tree facing south.

1068
00:58:14.74 --> 00:58:17.34
He gave me his best, are you out of your fucking mind?

1069
00:58:17.34 --> 00:58:25.82
Look, because he knew at that proximity, the back blast would kill us all when we set it off.

1070
00:58:25.82 --> 00:58:28.78
So he hesitated and I had to order him to do it.

1071
00:58:28.78 --> 00:58:32.70
As he finished the remaining two little people paired up and hooked themselves onto into

1072
00:58:32.70 --> 00:58:36.86
one of the ropes while Bubba and I each took one of the remaining two.

1073
00:58:36.86 --> 00:58:40.70
I wanted to balance out the weight distribution by having me on one side of the helicopter

1074
00:58:40.70 --> 00:58:45.18
and Bubba on the other, but it was impossible to tell for sure which ropes went where.

1075
00:58:45.18 --> 00:58:48.54
So I took a wild guess and hoped for the best.

1076
00:58:48.54 --> 00:58:49.54
Best.

1077
00:58:49.54 --> 00:58:54.30
Using the barrel of my M79 to shield the flash from the NVA, I used a strobe like to signal

1078
00:58:54.30 --> 00:58:58.74
the chopper to begin lifting us out.

1079
00:58:58.74 --> 00:59:01.26
Did the chopper have enough power?

1080
00:59:01.26 --> 00:59:03.30
Would we be dragged through the trees?

1081
00:59:03.30 --> 00:59:08.38
Would the NVA manage to shoot one or all of us out of our saddles?

1082
00:59:08.38 --> 00:59:11.78
We were about to find out.

1083
00:59:11.78 --> 00:59:17.82
As the ropes became taught, fire, gunfire erupted from the west, south, fucking, I returned,

1084
00:59:17.82 --> 00:59:23.38
fire, but our bodies blocked the others line of sight so they watched in frustration.

1085
00:59:23.38 --> 00:59:27.50
Because my rope was longer than the other three, I was the last to leave the ground.

1086
00:59:27.50 --> 00:59:33.86
This also gave me the additional seconds I needed to reload my empty car 15 twice.

1087
00:59:33.86 --> 00:59:38.90
Things were happening very fast almost too fast and my bright idea demanded perfect timing

1088
00:59:38.90 --> 00:59:44.62
as we started up, Bubba reached out and ignited the delay flues on the delay fuse on the

1089
00:59:44.62 --> 00:59:48.74
last claim or the one he'd fastened to the tree.

1090
00:59:48.74 --> 00:59:53.50
With my feet dangling in the air, I fired around for my M79.

1091
00:59:53.50 --> 00:59:58.78
Still gaining altitude, I then pulled the pins on two hand grenades and tossed them down

1092
00:59:58.78 --> 01:00:03.50
onto the ground at about the same time that claim more went off.

1093
01:00:03.50 --> 01:00:09.74
The back blast blew under us, but we could still feel it's power and heat.

1094
01:00:09.74 --> 01:00:15.78
The phosphorus was like a giant flash bulb going off, and that frozen instant of illumination

1095
01:00:15.78 --> 01:00:18.94
I could finally see the faces of my enemy.

1096
01:00:18.94 --> 01:00:20.86
They were hurting.

1097
01:00:20.86 --> 01:00:23.26
But still advancing.

1098
01:00:23.26 --> 01:00:28.42
The engine screaming, the Huey somehow came up with the power it needed.

1099
01:00:28.42 --> 01:00:33.30
It was agonizingly slow going and we had to push our way through some branches, but we

1100
01:00:33.30 --> 01:00:35.42
were not being dragged through them.

1101
01:00:35.42 --> 01:00:37.82
We were being lifted straight up.

1102
01:00:37.82 --> 01:00:43.86
The NVA continued to fire at us and I had the unsettling impression that trace around

1103
01:00:43.86 --> 01:00:50.62
for passing between my legs and sensation that will give any man pause for thought.

1104
01:00:50.62 --> 01:00:55.86
The team fired back on full automatic and we threw the last of our grenades.

1105
01:00:55.86 --> 01:01:02.98
Like two fiercely-demented and determined beasts, the NVA and RT Idaho remain locked in battle

1106
01:01:02.98 --> 01:01:05.54
to the bitter end.

1107
01:01:05.54 --> 01:01:09.74
As we finally cleared the trees, I immediately called Kovie and confessed our little

1108
01:01:09.74 --> 01:01:10.74
deception.

1109
01:01:10.74 --> 01:01:12.38
The team is out.

1110
01:01:12.38 --> 01:01:14.94
The whole team is out, I screamed into the handset.

1111
01:01:14.94 --> 01:01:18.30
We came out together, do not send in a second helicopter.

1112
01:01:18.30 --> 01:01:21.98
I repeat, no second chopper.

1113
01:01:21.98 --> 01:01:24.58
The muskets rolled in and pulverize the ground.

1114
01:01:24.58 --> 01:01:25.58
We had just left.

1115
01:01:25.58 --> 01:01:31.26
The A1Es were right behind them and as the muffled explosion and light flashes reached

1116
01:01:31.26 --> 01:01:36.18
me, I found myself feeling a little sorry for the NVA troops down there.

1117
01:01:36.18 --> 01:01:39.62
They were valiant and dedicated soldiers.

1118
01:01:39.62 --> 01:01:43.54
They would have to be a credit to any army.

1119
01:01:43.54 --> 01:01:47.50
Those left alive would no doubt have some stories to tell.

1120
01:01:47.50 --> 01:01:52.06
And I doubted that they would ever admit that a six-man team had held them at bay for so

1121
01:01:52.06 --> 01:01:58.14
long and then escaped their most determined efforts to wipe them out.

1122
01:01:58.14 --> 01:02:04.02
As for RT Idaho, we were simply happy to be alive.

1123
01:02:04.02 --> 01:02:09.02
Not something I would have bet on a short while earlier.

1124
01:02:09.02 --> 01:02:17.90
Oh yeah.

1125
01:02:17.90 --> 01:02:19.34
We were lucky too because of the...

1126
01:02:19.34 --> 01:02:23.58
It was more or more lucky than that.

1127
01:02:23.58 --> 01:02:26.30
We used to hold a lot of luck on that one.

1128
01:02:26.30 --> 01:02:34.90
But we were still relatively high and not like the big peaks and deeper into layoffs.

1129
01:02:34.90 --> 01:02:37.62
So the helicopter was able to pull us out.

1130
01:02:37.62 --> 01:02:44.46
If that had been in the middle of the day and with jungle heat and heat of the day, he never

1131
01:02:44.46 --> 01:02:47.22
would have been able to live six of us out.

1132
01:02:47.22 --> 01:02:50.30
But we weighed all that and I did not listen to the cub.

1133
01:02:50.30 --> 01:02:55.66
We just rolled the dice because it was so dark at that point.

1134
01:02:55.66 --> 01:03:00.34
So oh yeah, the recon guide's smoth on us one more time.

1135
01:03:00.34 --> 01:03:01.34
So when you...

1136
01:03:01.34 --> 01:03:05.18
Once you got pulled out, would they just look for a clearing somewhere to set down, get

1137
01:03:05.18 --> 01:03:07.14
you guys in the helicopter for real?

1138
01:03:07.14 --> 01:03:12.42
No that's the part that they just froze your balls all the way home.

1139
01:03:12.42 --> 01:03:16.94
Because with the Swiss season out, it was just everything goes numb.

1140
01:03:16.94 --> 01:03:21.26
And so because it was dark, particularly they wanted to make sure they were ready to

1141
01:03:21.26 --> 01:03:22.26
put us down.

1142
01:03:22.26 --> 01:03:23.66
It was going to be somewhere in South Vietnam.

1143
01:03:23.66 --> 01:03:24.66
So we were in the air.

1144
01:03:24.66 --> 01:03:27.98
I just figured how long and they finally set us down.

1145
01:03:27.98 --> 01:03:28.98
But you can't walk.

1146
01:03:28.98 --> 01:03:31.82
You lie to like a triple for a few minutes.

1147
01:03:31.82 --> 01:03:32.82
Yeah.

1148
01:03:32.82 --> 01:03:33.82
On clip, you can't flip.

1149
01:03:33.82 --> 01:03:37.74
So they didn't really care about your comfort.

1150
01:03:37.74 --> 01:03:38.74
No.

1151
01:03:38.74 --> 01:03:40.74
And we didn't clean too much.

1152
01:03:40.74 --> 01:03:42.78
But you go, you're all sweaty.

1153
01:03:42.78 --> 01:03:43.78
And you held it.

1154
01:03:43.78 --> 01:03:46.54
Five minutes later, you're a 5000 feet, which is cold.

1155
01:03:46.54 --> 01:03:49.38
People get how cold it is at 5000 feet.

1156
01:03:49.38 --> 01:03:50.38
Yeah, you're freezing.

1157
01:03:50.38 --> 01:03:52.34
Yeah, especially because you're soaking wet.

1158
01:03:52.34 --> 01:03:55.06
And you're going 80 miles an hour.

1159
01:03:55.06 --> 01:03:57.90
So you go 80 mile an hour a wind.

1160
01:03:57.90 --> 01:04:01.90
All that too.

1161
01:04:01.90 --> 01:04:06.14
And this is just, I mean, this is crazy.

1162
01:04:06.14 --> 01:04:09.82
It's absolutely crazy.

1163
01:04:09.82 --> 01:04:12.70
And this was just over and over again.

1164
01:04:12.70 --> 01:04:20.26
Now, you know, I spent a lot of time on the books on the last couple podcasts.

1165
01:04:20.26 --> 01:04:25.10
I wanted to kind of just ask you a couple questions.

1166
01:04:25.10 --> 01:04:28.62
Get your thoughts on some stuff.

1167
01:04:28.62 --> 01:04:30.82
And I also, and I don't know, we might have to come back again.

1168
01:04:30.82 --> 01:04:32.02
And I got sawed chronicles here.

1169
01:04:32.02 --> 01:04:34.38
I read that outstanding book.

1170
01:04:34.38 --> 01:04:38.34
And this is sawed chronicles real quick.

1171
01:04:38.34 --> 01:04:43.46
Talks about a big operation that took place, that you weren't on.

1172
01:04:43.46 --> 01:04:46.86
But you got really good descriptions and talked to people.

1173
01:04:46.86 --> 01:04:48.18
Operation tailwind.

1174
01:04:48.18 --> 01:04:51.70
That's another one where helicopters are getting shot down.

1175
01:04:51.70 --> 01:04:55.34
I mean, it's completely insane.

1176
01:04:55.34 --> 01:04:57.46
Yeah, and no ordinary.

1177
01:04:57.46 --> 01:04:59.90
He looked these are the CH53s.

1178
01:04:59.90 --> 01:05:00.90
They're not the models.

1179
01:05:00.90 --> 01:05:01.90
Yeah.

1180
01:05:01.90 --> 01:05:03.34
The biggest Marine Corps had.

1181
01:05:03.34 --> 01:05:04.66
And they took out two of those.

1182
01:05:04.66 --> 01:05:07.82
I think left one really banged up.

1183
01:05:07.82 --> 01:05:12.62
And when they inserted, they still, they had three WAs on their assertion.

1184
01:05:12.62 --> 01:05:17.82
But they had to get in for that to take the pressure off of the CIA operation.

1185
01:05:17.82 --> 01:05:19.78
That was the mission, September 1970.

1186
01:05:19.78 --> 01:05:20.78
Yeah.

1187
01:05:20.78 --> 01:05:22.94
So that's Operation tailwind.

1188
01:05:22.94 --> 01:05:23.94
Operation tailwind.

1189
01:05:23.94 --> 01:05:26.82
And that book saw chronicles volume one.

1190
01:05:26.82 --> 01:05:30.02
And I hope there's going to be about 30 more volumes of sawed.

1191
01:05:30.02 --> 01:05:33.82
We're going to be working on the model that Anne and I came up with is that we're going

1192
01:05:33.82 --> 01:05:35.02
to write till we die.

1193
01:05:35.02 --> 01:05:36.02
I like it.

1194
01:05:36.02 --> 01:05:39.70
Because there's so many saws stories that there have been told could we couldn't tell.

1195
01:05:39.70 --> 01:05:40.70
And so many of our guys.

1196
01:05:40.70 --> 01:05:44.42
I mean, even when I, a fellow recon guy, talked to him.

1197
01:05:44.42 --> 01:05:46.26
It's like pulling information on him.

1198
01:05:46.26 --> 01:05:48.34
I'm sure you've run into that with your people.

1199
01:05:48.34 --> 01:05:51.06
They're not, they're not inclined to talk.

1200
01:05:51.06 --> 01:05:52.06
Well, yeah.

1201
01:05:52.06 --> 01:05:53.06
They're modest.

1202
01:05:53.06 --> 01:05:56.22
That's an interesting thing because people do not want to be at the bar.

1203
01:05:56.22 --> 01:05:57.22
Yeah.

1204
01:05:57.22 --> 01:05:58.78
I'm a green beret or a machine.

1205
01:05:58.78 --> 01:06:03.34
And most of the guys, when people say, well, you should have more guys from to you

1206
01:06:03.34 --> 01:06:04.34
bruiser on there.

1207
01:06:04.34 --> 01:06:06.38
You have to have more guys more seals on.

1208
01:06:06.38 --> 01:06:08.70
The seals that I know that I would want to have on a lot of them.

1209
01:06:08.70 --> 01:06:09.70
They're still in.

1210
01:06:09.70 --> 01:06:10.70
Or they don't want to come on.

1211
01:06:10.70 --> 01:06:11.70
That's it.

1212
01:06:11.70 --> 01:06:12.70
They won't say it.

1213
01:06:12.70 --> 01:06:13.70
Yeah.

1214
01:06:13.70 --> 01:06:15.50
They're like, hey, I'm good.

1215
01:06:15.50 --> 01:06:19.22
And then obviously, I got a lot of my friends that do come on.

1216
01:06:19.22 --> 01:06:21.46
And it's great when they come on.

1217
01:06:21.46 --> 01:06:25.02
But yeah, a lot of guys are still doing it.

1218
01:06:25.02 --> 01:06:27.34
And so, hey, that's the way it is.

1219
01:06:27.34 --> 01:06:30.42
Once those guys retire, and I do have some friends that are retired soon, and they're

1220
01:06:30.42 --> 01:06:31.42
become what I'm on.

1221
01:06:31.42 --> 01:06:32.42
So that's pretty awesome.

1222
01:06:32.42 --> 01:06:33.42
Oh, yeah.

1223
01:06:33.42 --> 01:06:34.42
But yeah.

1224
01:06:34.42 --> 01:06:39.98
So the song Chronicles, you've, like I said, hopefully there's 30 volumes that right

1225
01:06:39.98 --> 01:06:40.98
now there's just one.

1226
01:06:40.98 --> 01:06:45.66
We're going to try to turn across the fence and on a ground into audio books.

1227
01:06:45.66 --> 01:06:46.66
That's awesome.

1228
01:06:46.66 --> 01:06:47.66
That's our project right now.

1229
01:06:47.66 --> 01:06:53.06
And then as soon as we're done with that, it commenced with volume two.

1230
01:06:53.06 --> 01:06:55.38
And we got a couple of stories there.

1231
01:06:55.38 --> 01:07:01.50
What a one that we talked about in on the ground, the August 23 attack.

1232
01:07:01.50 --> 01:07:03.22
We've had a lot more research.

1233
01:07:03.22 --> 01:07:08.46
We had the scale who's a, as she was in M.I. and she has pulled out more information.

1234
01:07:08.46 --> 01:07:12.54
She's going to pull the whole thing together for the, hopefully the most detailed story

1235
01:07:12.54 --> 01:07:17.30
in the night because we're such a tragic, yet heroic night for the people that were there

1236
01:07:17.30 --> 01:07:18.30
on the ground in night.

1237
01:07:18.30 --> 01:07:20.98
And Larry Trimble up on Marble Mountain.

1238
01:07:20.98 --> 01:07:21.98
Yeah.

1239
01:07:21.98 --> 01:07:24.74
And that couple of the stories, many other stories.

1240
01:07:24.74 --> 01:07:27.10
But there's the other one.

1241
01:07:27.10 --> 01:07:33.78
One of our guys went in for a bright light and they got shot out at a, at four

1242
01:07:33.78 --> 01:07:35.50
crass.

1243
01:07:35.50 --> 01:07:40.78
As it was crashing, you hit three separate hill tops coming to rest on a third one.

1244
01:07:40.78 --> 01:07:45.10
They got to the second hill and got shot out.

1245
01:07:45.10 --> 01:07:47.74
He went back 25 years later.

1246
01:07:47.74 --> 01:07:55.18
He became a doctor on his own money spent $70,000 to go back to Cambodia to try to find

1247
01:07:55.18 --> 01:07:58.54
that effort just nodded his conscience.

1248
01:07:58.54 --> 01:08:03.26
They got in, got to the site and we're run off by bandits.

1249
01:08:03.26 --> 01:08:07.74
He went back now, would be two years ago, with DPA.

1250
01:08:07.74 --> 01:08:13.06
And DPA was working on the second hill where the jet was on the third hill.

1251
01:08:13.06 --> 01:08:18.98
So he's able to go in to give them direct sighting as to where the dig.

1252
01:08:18.98 --> 01:08:22.30
So there's still work and he was on the ground digging things out with these guys.

1253
01:08:22.30 --> 01:08:23.58
That's going to be a netbook.

1254
01:08:23.58 --> 01:08:24.58
Yeah.

1255
01:08:24.58 --> 01:08:28.18
So check out that book too.

1256
01:08:28.18 --> 01:08:30.74
Saw Chronicles.

1257
01:08:30.74 --> 01:08:33.10
You're training.

1258
01:08:33.10 --> 01:08:36.26
How ready do you think you were when you got to Vietnam?

1259
01:08:36.26 --> 01:08:41.38
How ready for you for what you were about to encounter?

1260
01:08:41.38 --> 01:08:45.78
Well, a lot better than the guys that went through just basic training and advanced infantry

1261
01:08:45.78 --> 01:08:46.78
training.

1262
01:08:46.78 --> 01:08:50.62
And I'm sure that commencement units had in country training.

1263
01:08:50.62 --> 01:08:53.50
Our in country training was good.

1264
01:08:53.50 --> 01:08:54.50
He worked.

1265
01:08:54.50 --> 01:09:00.82
We practiced calling in spooky, worked with the helicopters, told about the dangers and working

1266
01:09:00.82 --> 01:09:06.22
with the little people, the history as well as some of the do's and don'ts about working

1267
01:09:06.22 --> 01:09:09.14
with South Vietnamese.

1268
01:09:09.14 --> 01:09:15.26
I thought that was good, but then to just no aid camp duty, I think all that was geared

1269
01:09:15.26 --> 01:09:17.30
for the aid camps.

1270
01:09:17.30 --> 01:09:19.38
Sog was just at another level.

1271
01:09:19.38 --> 01:09:20.70
And that's why we always talked.

1272
01:09:20.70 --> 01:09:26.74
So people like Pat Watkins by the parks, John McGovern, Dick Gross, they were the senior

1273
01:09:26.74 --> 01:09:28.82
e7s or e6s in camp.

1274
01:09:28.82 --> 01:09:31.38
All of whom had run at night.

1275
01:09:31.38 --> 01:09:35.22
A screen guys would talk to them, particularly after mission.

1276
01:09:35.22 --> 01:09:36.98
And then we talked to each other.

1277
01:09:36.98 --> 01:09:43.82
You know, John Watten came back from a target and where Tom Cunney-Hemp's leg was blown

1278
01:09:43.82 --> 01:09:44.82
off.

1279
01:09:44.82 --> 01:09:48.58
One of those little people who got shot four times and captain 10 who saved us and knocked

1280
01:09:48.58 --> 01:09:51.18
over, pulled them out and August.

1281
01:09:51.18 --> 01:09:52.98
And we talked right away.

1282
01:09:52.98 --> 01:09:55.50
That night, well, what did you learn?

1283
01:09:55.50 --> 01:10:01.26
And it always be just back and forth to try to get any sense of what happened to anything

1284
01:10:01.26 --> 01:10:05.38
you could do to give us anything for another edge in the field.

1285
01:10:05.38 --> 01:10:07.02
And meanwhile, we're getting the intel reports.

1286
01:10:07.02 --> 01:10:09.82
We knew about all the teams that had been wiped out.

1287
01:10:09.82 --> 01:10:12.50
And the intel reports about the sappers.

1288
01:10:12.50 --> 01:10:15.34
So you all bounced it out and just keep things with us.

1289
01:10:15.34 --> 01:10:17.50
So an answer to your question.

1290
01:10:17.50 --> 01:10:20.22
Sog was so different, a lot of with innovative.

1291
01:10:20.22 --> 01:10:23.14
The things we were doing there were the strings.

1292
01:10:23.14 --> 01:10:26.34
That was all things that used today really advanced.

1293
01:10:26.34 --> 01:10:28.34
You know, no fast ropes.

1294
01:10:28.34 --> 01:10:31.94
That was another dimension of when, another war.

1295
01:10:31.94 --> 01:10:39.54
So we're working that firepower, working with the air assets and new weapons.

1296
01:10:39.54 --> 01:10:41.18
But it was all like to experiment with things.

1297
01:10:41.18 --> 01:10:42.98
The learns you go, try to take was best.

1298
01:10:42.98 --> 01:10:46.86
And like, limb black blow yourself up in the, and the ambushes were good luck to make

1299
01:10:46.86 --> 01:10:49.66
sure it really works.

1300
01:10:49.66 --> 01:10:51.86
Did you, when you were calling for fires?

1301
01:10:51.86 --> 01:10:55.62
So I don't know if you know this, but now it's like a school you go to.

1302
01:10:55.62 --> 01:10:59.98
You go to a joint tattoo leader controller school and that's sort of your specialty is calling

1303
01:10:59.98 --> 01:11:02.26
for fire call or bombs.

1304
01:11:02.26 --> 01:11:08.02
But you just, you trained in country to learn how to do it.

1305
01:11:08.02 --> 01:11:09.02
Yes.

1306
01:11:09.02 --> 01:11:14.86
And again, we talked to, that's what we talked to spider and pat walk as specifically.

1307
01:11:14.86 --> 01:11:19.22
And so that was, that was more important than actually going out pop in the smoke and

1308
01:11:19.22 --> 01:11:20.70
having the gun run.

1309
01:11:20.70 --> 01:11:23.42
It was learning how to do it the right way.

1310
01:11:23.42 --> 01:11:27.74
Now you're in a box and you never have a gun run go across you.

1311
01:11:27.74 --> 01:11:32.58
It'd be in front, you know, you're front to left southeast and you direct it that way.

1312
01:11:32.58 --> 01:11:37.82
And how many inches, I mean, how many feet of yards from your perimeter, how many meters.

1313
01:11:37.82 --> 01:11:44.58
And that applied when we got to the field because once we were up at Fubai, we didn't

1314
01:11:44.58 --> 01:11:45.58
practice air strikes.

1315
01:11:45.58 --> 01:11:48.74
Once we were on the ground, we did it.

1316
01:11:48.74 --> 01:11:50.70
But it did it with confidence.

1317
01:11:50.70 --> 01:11:54.70
Thanks to spider or walkins and John McGovern particularly.

1318
01:11:54.70 --> 01:11:59.14
They sat with us, our green guys at night and made us understand that.

1319
01:11:59.14 --> 01:12:04.70
And we had a couple cases where people made mistakes and teams got hit and lost people.

1320
01:12:04.70 --> 01:12:07.18
They had their brain and some people.

1321
01:12:07.18 --> 01:12:11.38
We were our body count was so low that they were bringing in people from other units.

1322
01:12:11.38 --> 01:12:14.02
And they would come in cocky.

1323
01:12:14.02 --> 01:12:17.46
And once they got on the ground, they were just maybe a little too cocky and had to listen

1324
01:12:17.46 --> 01:12:19.50
to all lessons.

1325
01:12:19.50 --> 01:12:22.18
And some of the teams will let the other people carry their rest.

1326
01:12:22.18 --> 01:12:23.90
Why carry their radio.

1327
01:12:23.90 --> 01:12:29.82
And we had one team, young guy came in and called the air strike on its own team.

1328
01:12:29.82 --> 01:12:32.66
They came with a gun and we're right across the teams.

1329
01:12:32.66 --> 01:12:35.82
R.O.N. and it's like that.

1330
01:12:35.82 --> 01:12:38.38
So that does not surprise me at all.

1331
01:12:38.38 --> 01:12:45.78
I mean, when I'm listening to a reading your books, the fact that you guys were doing that,

1332
01:12:45.78 --> 01:12:50.06
you obviously had a massive amount of skill to not have that happen.

1333
01:12:50.06 --> 01:12:53.62
Because like I said, these guys are looking at a jungle canopy.

1334
01:12:53.62 --> 01:12:58.50
They look at some random bit of smoke that came out and yet you're directing fire based

1335
01:12:58.50 --> 01:12:59.50
on that.

1336
01:12:59.50 --> 01:13:00.78
It's awesome.

1337
01:13:00.78 --> 01:13:05.06
But I could see where somebody could easily make a mistake.

1338
01:13:05.06 --> 01:13:07.86
You give the wrong direction.

1339
01:13:07.86 --> 01:13:09.70
Look at your compass is spinning the wrong way.

1340
01:13:09.70 --> 01:13:10.70
It's good close to your weapon.

1341
01:13:10.70 --> 01:13:12.06
You've got your carmel directions.

1342
01:13:12.06 --> 01:13:14.38
I mean, there's so many things that could go wrong.

1343
01:13:14.38 --> 01:13:16.74
And yet you're just doing.

1344
01:13:16.74 --> 01:13:21.94
I mean, there's times we're out there doing gun runs for 12 hours straight.

1345
01:13:21.94 --> 01:13:29.50
And like your case, where you had the unit that you wanted to attack the building and

1346
01:13:29.50 --> 01:13:33.38
you challenged the three times and the last time you called it up because it was another

1347
01:13:33.38 --> 01:13:35.22
unit, another seal team.

1348
01:13:35.22 --> 01:13:39.62
Well, we had that common sense thing on the ground, too, where we would direct it.

1349
01:13:39.62 --> 01:13:43.70
But if there was something that wasn't quite right, you put everything on hold until

1350
01:13:43.70 --> 01:13:45.30
you got it right.

1351
01:13:45.30 --> 01:13:46.54
Yeah, that's weird.

1352
01:13:46.54 --> 01:13:53.62
Because late for my road extreme ownership and we didn't really coordinate stories that

1353
01:13:53.62 --> 01:13:54.78
we were talking about.

1354
01:13:54.78 --> 01:13:59.30
And yet there's multiple stories in there about either blue on blues or a potential blue

1355
01:13:59.30 --> 01:14:04.22
on blues because man in a city like that with all these different units running around

1356
01:14:04.22 --> 01:14:09.90
all on different radio frequencies and a bunch of enemy, Mujah, Dean fighters running

1357
01:14:09.90 --> 01:14:10.86
around in there, too.

1358
01:14:10.86 --> 01:14:13.78
It was blue on blue was a very real thing.

1359
01:14:13.78 --> 01:14:20.06
And there would be probably one case of blue on blue a day that would happen and maybe

1360
01:14:20.06 --> 01:14:22.34
one a week that would get reported.

1361
01:14:22.34 --> 01:14:27.18
You know, but just, and I'm not talking where someone is shot, but like, you know, just

1362
01:14:27.18 --> 01:14:29.98
all of a sudden you're taking rounds and you're like, where are those coming from?

1363
01:14:29.98 --> 01:14:32.22
Oh, that's another unit down there.

1364
01:14:32.22 --> 01:14:36.46
And maybe before, and for a one opening up moment, exactly exactly.

1365
01:14:36.46 --> 01:14:39.50
So that it would happen all the time.

1366
01:14:39.50 --> 01:14:43.58
And that's one thing that was nice about, well, for you, if not nice, but it's

1367
01:14:43.58 --> 01:14:46.94
less complicated, you're the only friendly guys out there to watch out.

1368
01:14:46.94 --> 01:14:48.42
Oh, there was no friendly fire happening.

1369
01:14:48.42 --> 01:14:50.42
You guys, you're a versus them.

1370
01:14:50.42 --> 01:14:51.42
Yeah, all of them.

1371
01:14:51.42 --> 01:14:51.42
Yeah.

1372
01:14:51.42 --> 01:14:59.26
When you got mission taskings, where did they come from?

1373
01:14:59.26 --> 01:15:00.98
Where did they come from up above?

1374
01:15:00.98 --> 01:15:03.02
Where you guys developing targets yourself?

1375
01:15:03.02 --> 01:15:04.02
Where did that process?

1376
01:15:04.02 --> 01:15:07.42
That's what happened, mix of both.

1377
01:15:07.42 --> 01:15:11.26
The Channing Command for Saw, went to Sawcheadquarters right to the White House.

1378
01:15:11.26 --> 01:15:14.46
They had somebody from DOD that was there.

1379
01:15:14.46 --> 01:15:16.54
I don't know, some general, somebody.

1380
01:15:16.54 --> 01:15:19.66
But that was their mission was keeping on on Sawc.

1381
01:15:19.66 --> 01:15:25.66
So they was sent missions from there that would come to Headquarters to each F.O.B.

1382
01:15:25.66 --> 01:15:31.34
And then our immediate action reports that I'll go back after action reports to go back

1383
01:15:31.34 --> 01:15:33.14
through the Channing Command.

1384
01:15:33.14 --> 01:15:35.66
So they knew what was going on at the White House.

1385
01:15:35.66 --> 01:15:36.82
There was somebody at the White House.

1386
01:15:36.82 --> 01:15:38.22
That's where we were told.

1387
01:15:38.22 --> 01:15:44.38
And on occasions, if we had a target that we wanted to do B.52 strike, that would go back

1388
01:15:44.38 --> 01:15:47.86
through the Channing Command and then get approval on it.

1389
01:15:47.86 --> 01:15:53.46
But from what the public knew, the public knew we were bombing.

1390
01:15:53.46 --> 01:15:54.46
Not even know anything about that.

1391
01:15:54.46 --> 01:15:59.14
They didn't even know we were bombing Louson Combo to get.

1392
01:15:59.14 --> 01:16:00.14
Nothing.

1393
01:16:00.14 --> 01:16:01.42
There was no reporters in there.

1394
01:16:01.42 --> 01:16:05.22
There's no communist news network back then.

1395
01:16:05.22 --> 01:16:12.70
So the communist would not talk about it because they agreed to the agreement.

1396
01:16:12.70 --> 01:16:13.86
Not having their people there.

1397
01:16:13.86 --> 01:16:16.26
Cadillac said, hey, Louson Combo, they're neutral.

1398
01:16:16.26 --> 01:16:17.46
We respect them.

1399
01:16:17.46 --> 01:16:19.46
Line dogs.

1400
01:16:19.46 --> 01:16:20.74
And we said the same thing.

1401
01:16:20.74 --> 01:16:23.26
But ours, we just went in with our recon teams.

1402
01:16:23.26 --> 01:16:28.14
I suppose that them just going down and slaving all the people to work there.

1403
01:16:28.14 --> 01:16:30.74
Work with us, help us open the roads.

1404
01:16:30.74 --> 01:16:33.74
And if we saw in Disney's people, we would not open fire on.

1405
01:16:33.74 --> 01:16:35.86
I mean, it's like not going to go at local people.

1406
01:16:35.86 --> 01:16:39.66
They don't know any better, just caught in the middle.

1407
01:16:39.66 --> 01:16:43.66
But the NVA, they were talking.

1408
01:16:43.66 --> 01:16:45.26
You work with us so you die.

1409
01:16:45.26 --> 01:16:50.74
Well, you know, in one of the books you're talking about how the NVA treated the

1410
01:16:50.74 --> 01:16:55.70
in-dedge people there, so horribly that the in-dedge troops that you worked with, but

1411
01:16:55.70 --> 01:16:56.70
hated the NVA.

1412
01:16:56.70 --> 01:16:57.70
Oh, they hated them.

1413
01:16:57.70 --> 01:17:02.66
That these NVA had raped their women, beat their wives and just unharable things.

1414
01:17:02.66 --> 01:17:03.66
Absolutely.

1415
01:17:03.66 --> 01:17:06.58
They were there for, they were there to fight.

1416
01:17:06.58 --> 01:17:07.58
Yep.

1417
01:17:07.58 --> 01:17:10.98
And they cut nobody else like them.

1418
01:17:10.98 --> 01:17:17.02
I mean, America today, particularly our snowflakes, don't know what the soldiers of

1419
01:17:17.02 --> 01:17:20.10
Communists were really like in the field.

1420
01:17:20.10 --> 01:17:22.54
And it's just nasty people.

1421
01:17:22.54 --> 01:17:25.26
And that's what we were fighting.

1422
01:17:25.26 --> 01:17:27.30
And they were really dedicated.

1423
01:17:27.30 --> 01:17:32.62
And they're just, that's a purpose because they've been so thoroughly indoctrinated.

1424
01:17:32.62 --> 01:17:40.06
And they really believe what they were doing, even though they were working off a propaganda.

1425
01:17:40.06 --> 01:17:41.26
Yeah.

1426
01:17:41.26 --> 01:17:44.98
When you, so you would come up with some of the missions, some of the missions would come

1427
01:17:44.98 --> 01:17:45.98
down to you.

1428
01:17:45.98 --> 01:17:46.98
Majority came.

1429
01:17:46.98 --> 01:17:47.98
Majority came down to you.

1430
01:17:47.98 --> 01:17:52.90
And of course, you know, they would have, sometimes I think there would be, we

1431
01:17:52.90 --> 01:17:53.90
got a team on a ground.

1432
01:17:53.90 --> 01:17:58.62
That's why we were going in primary secondary all think it's shot out, eat lunch, go

1433
01:17:58.62 --> 01:17:59.62
back and try again.

1434
01:17:59.62 --> 01:18:02.38
And they just wanted to get somebody on the ground.

1435
01:18:02.38 --> 01:18:06.06
And that would just be your, that's an automatic area of reconnaissance.

1436
01:18:06.06 --> 01:18:09.46
And that's because they had something they wanted to see there, something like that.

1437
01:18:09.46 --> 01:18:12.98
Sometimes her S3 people would just want to get a team on the ground so they could

1438
01:18:12.98 --> 01:18:14.34
report a headquarters at night.

1439
01:18:14.34 --> 01:18:17.74
We had one or two teams on the ground.

1440
01:18:17.74 --> 01:18:21.06
Wait, do you mean that they're just wanting to, hey, look what we're doing?

1441
01:18:21.06 --> 01:18:22.06
Yeah.

1442
01:18:22.06 --> 01:18:26.70
Now, I'll show you guys that on S3 would deny that in fanitly.

1443
01:18:26.70 --> 01:18:28.10
But it felt like that.

1444
01:18:28.10 --> 01:18:29.10
Yeah.

1445
01:18:29.10 --> 01:18:31.50
I came back and said, here's the new target.

1446
01:18:31.50 --> 01:18:36.86
And they'll pick an LZ for you while you're flying back to the next target.

1447
01:18:36.86 --> 01:18:40.46
Did you ever, what if you, what if there was a mission that you looked at and you said, hey,

1448
01:18:40.46 --> 01:18:42.02
this is dumb.

1449
01:18:42.02 --> 01:18:43.62
This doesn't make sense.

1450
01:18:43.62 --> 01:18:47.10
What is only one that I declined to remember about Christmas time of 68.

1451
01:18:47.10 --> 01:18:48.70
I just had a feeling.

1452
01:18:48.70 --> 01:18:49.70
And a team went in.

1453
01:18:49.70 --> 01:18:50.70
I was worried.

1454
01:18:50.70 --> 01:18:53.14
But they were on the ground for five days and it was a dry hole.

1455
01:18:53.14 --> 01:18:56.46
And they came out without any shots fired or anything.

1456
01:18:56.46 --> 01:18:59.22
So that's the one time I officially turned something down.

1457
01:18:59.22 --> 01:19:00.70
Maybe that's why you had a bad feeling.

1458
01:19:00.70 --> 01:19:02.86
Tell it, you knew nothing was going to happen.

1459
01:19:02.86 --> 01:19:04.38
It wasn't your kind of target.

1460
01:19:04.38 --> 01:19:05.38
Yeah.

1461
01:19:05.38 --> 01:19:08.58
I don't want a boring target.

1462
01:19:08.58 --> 01:19:11.30
So how did it go when you said no?

1463
01:19:11.30 --> 01:19:12.90
Would you say, hey, look, my guys need rest.

1464
01:19:12.90 --> 01:19:13.90
Sorry.

1465
01:19:13.90 --> 01:19:14.90
Yeah, not this time.

1466
01:19:14.90 --> 01:19:16.42
We had to write to say no.

1467
01:19:16.42 --> 01:19:17.58
It was frowned on.

1468
01:19:17.58 --> 01:19:22.34
But at that time, we had a couple of new teams in camp.

1469
01:19:22.34 --> 01:19:25.46
And Rodney had came in and he was a good one zero.

1470
01:19:25.46 --> 01:19:28.14
So he went out and he came back to, hey, that target was pretty cool.

1471
01:19:28.14 --> 01:19:30.14
We stopped a lot.

1472
01:19:30.14 --> 01:19:31.14
Dry hole.

1473
01:19:31.14 --> 01:19:32.14
Dry hole.

1474
01:19:32.14 --> 01:19:33.14
I said, really?

1475
01:19:33.14 --> 01:19:34.14
So how are these feelings, man?

1476
01:19:34.14 --> 01:19:35.62
I was hyperventilating to that figure.

1477
01:19:35.62 --> 01:19:40.30
We were going to run into Ho Chi Minh and a couple of divisions again for good luck.

1478
01:19:40.30 --> 01:19:42.86
I hadn't seen a division in a month.

1479
01:19:42.86 --> 01:19:45.38
No, it's like, okay.

1480
01:19:45.38 --> 01:19:46.38
But no.

1481
01:19:46.38 --> 01:19:50.58
So that kind of showed me how your mental state of mind too.

1482
01:19:50.58 --> 01:19:53.58
Because that's why I believed.

1483
01:19:53.58 --> 01:19:56.94
And the system was such that you could turn it down.

1484
01:19:56.94 --> 01:19:58.06
And we took it from there.

1485
01:19:58.06 --> 01:20:02.22
When you say that's where you believed, you believed that it was a bad target.

1486
01:20:02.22 --> 01:20:07.38
I just thought we had been so lucky and going through the Christmas Thanksgiving and everything

1487
01:20:07.38 --> 01:20:12.10
else that our, I just thought our number was going to be, we didn't know how.

1488
01:20:12.10 --> 01:20:14.10
And I just said, this could be the target.

1489
01:20:14.10 --> 01:20:14.74
It's an M.A.

1490
01:20:14.74 --> 01:20:15.74
Target.

1491
01:20:15.74 --> 01:20:22.78
And those are particularly, the ones are on long to DMZ River west of Vietnam that went deeper

1492
01:20:22.78 --> 01:20:24.30
into chaos.

1493
01:20:24.30 --> 01:20:27.02
And there were nasty, we lost several teams up there.

1494
01:20:27.02 --> 01:20:29.10
I figured this could be our turn.

1495
01:20:29.10 --> 01:20:31.10
So, buzz wrong?

1496
01:20:31.10 --> 01:20:35.94
No, did you ever get that feeling again?

1497
01:20:35.94 --> 01:20:38.06
Not, not not strong enough to act on it.

1498
01:20:38.06 --> 01:20:40.78
I mean, the carried it back in my tiny mind.

1499
01:20:40.78 --> 01:20:44.66
It was like, that's the best time you thought you were going to die.

1500
01:20:44.66 --> 01:20:45.66
You didn't.

1501
01:20:45.66 --> 01:20:49.02
I had some guys that thought they were going to die every time we left the wire.

1502
01:20:49.02 --> 01:20:54.02
You know what I mean?

1503
01:20:54.02 --> 01:20:56.02
God bless them, but he's no man, this could die could be the night man.

1504
01:20:56.02 --> 01:20:57.02
No, I'm not feeling good about this one.

1505
01:20:57.02 --> 01:20:59.86
And they'd always get their gear on, but I'd say, I mean, I always looked at as a good sign.

1506
01:20:59.86 --> 01:21:04.02
If certain people were scared, if they wouldn't have been scared, I would have been nervous

1507
01:21:04.02 --> 01:21:05.82
because they were so scared all the time.

1508
01:21:05.82 --> 01:21:10.02
I think, man, this must be really stressful for them.

1509
01:21:10.02 --> 01:21:11.02
I never wrote the letter.

1510
01:21:11.02 --> 01:21:13.02
We're like, dear mom and dad, I'm dead now.

1511
01:21:13.02 --> 01:21:15.02
If you read this letter, I'm dead.

1512
01:21:15.02 --> 01:21:16.02
Yeah.

1513
01:21:16.02 --> 01:21:21.02
I felt, and hope that we somehow get through it.

1514
01:21:21.02 --> 01:21:23.02
And you're right about the scare thing.

1515
01:21:23.02 --> 01:21:26.02
You want that emotional edge, a little fear can go along.

1516
01:21:26.02 --> 01:21:28.02
It's a great motivator.

1517
01:21:28.02 --> 01:21:34.02
But I wouldn't go out with a guy if somebody was saying, hey, man, I'm not afraid.

1518
01:21:34.02 --> 01:21:36.02
I'm afraid of you, do you go somebody else?

1519
01:21:36.02 --> 01:21:44.02
I also used to get the feeling that if you were scared like that, if you were scared,

1520
01:21:44.02 --> 01:21:48.02
and you were going to be hesitant, that was going to be bad.

1521
01:21:48.02 --> 01:21:49.02
Sure.

1522
01:21:49.02 --> 01:21:57.02
Like, I was more worried about guys that were hesitant or I felt like if they were hesitant

1523
01:21:57.02 --> 01:22:03.02
on the battlefield, that would work out bad for them.

1524
01:22:03.02 --> 01:22:08.02
The guys that I always felt like, okay, if someone's aggressive, not not unaffraid

1525
01:22:08.02 --> 01:22:13.02
and suicidal like that, but just, hey, oh yeah, I'm going to go, I'm going to go,

1526
01:22:13.02 --> 01:22:14.02
I'm going to go out with a guy right now.

1527
01:22:14.02 --> 01:22:16.02
I always felt that was the attitude to have.

1528
01:22:16.02 --> 01:22:17.02
It was to be aggressive.

1529
01:22:17.02 --> 01:22:21.02
It was to be like, okay, yeah, well, oh, you want an opt for us?

1530
01:22:21.02 --> 01:22:22.02
Cool, we'll go do it.

1531
01:22:22.02 --> 01:22:24.02
Now we turned down opts too.

1532
01:22:24.02 --> 01:22:28.02
There was opts where we looked at and said, man, this is not good.

1533
01:22:28.02 --> 01:22:30.02
And this is a massive amount of risk.

1534
01:22:30.02 --> 01:22:36.02
I mean, there was areas where there was areas where they were taken,

1535
01:22:36.02 --> 01:22:40.02
IED strikes on vehicles, and like, you know,

1536
01:22:40.02 --> 01:22:45.02
when in a big IED hits a Humvee, everyone dies or three out of five people die or something like that,

1537
01:22:45.02 --> 01:22:47.02
I mean, it's very catastrophic.

1538
01:22:47.02 --> 01:22:50.02
And it was one target they were looking at for us.

1539
01:22:50.02 --> 01:22:52.02
They asked us to do.

1540
01:22:52.02 --> 01:22:57.02
And there was like one road going in and that had multiple big IED strikes.

1541
01:22:57.02 --> 01:23:03.02
And then they wanted us to, they were asking if we could take out more,

1542
01:23:03.02 --> 01:23:07.02
it was either a mortar team or an IED in place or but we were looking at it and where

1543
01:23:07.02 --> 01:23:09.02
the mortar has been launched from, we're all over the place.

1544
01:23:09.02 --> 01:23:14.02
So it was just, it was one of the, one of the types of missions where we looked at it and said,

1545
01:23:14.02 --> 01:23:18.02
hey, there's got to be a better way to do this because us going up there is not going to be worse than it.

1546
01:23:18.02 --> 01:23:20.02
A lot of your missions were point missions, right?

1547
01:23:20.02 --> 01:23:21.02
What do you mean by that?

1548
01:23:21.02 --> 01:23:25.02
They gave you a target, get to this point and wipe it out.

1549
01:23:25.02 --> 01:23:31.02
I would say my first deployment, it was go capture kill back guys.

1550
01:23:31.02 --> 01:23:33.02
That was my first deployment to Iraq, we were in Baghdad,

1551
01:23:33.02 --> 01:23:34.02
that's mostly what we were doing.

1552
01:23:34.02 --> 01:23:38.02
Middle the night, we'd find out where a bad guy was, we'd go get him.

1553
01:23:38.02 --> 01:23:44.02
And that's what my second deployment in Ramadi, mostly what guys were doing was

1554
01:23:44.02 --> 01:23:47.02
Overwatch, sniper Overwatch positions set up and building.

1555
01:23:47.02 --> 01:23:52.02
So that when the bad guys would either maneuver on friendly forces or they'd be out doing what they

1556
01:23:52.02 --> 01:23:53.02
shouldn't be doing, right?

1557
01:23:53.02 --> 01:23:54.02
The guys would take them out.

1558
01:23:54.02 --> 01:24:00.02
So that's pretty much the, then there's all kinds of crap in between that everything from,

1559
01:24:00.02 --> 01:24:03.02
you know, everything from doing just reconnaissance of areas.

1560
01:24:03.02 --> 01:24:10.02
To counter mortar types, it's just, you know, a lot of other things would happen.

1561
01:24:10.02 --> 01:24:15.02
But primarily it was direct action missions going out, take out a target or these sniper

1562
01:24:15.02 --> 01:24:20.02
Overwatch types, but you know, we'd be doing big clearances to big conventional clearances.

1563
01:24:20.02 --> 01:24:23.02
You know, we had our, we called them jundies, which is,

1564
01:24:23.02 --> 01:24:26.02
the jundie means, it means soldier in, in Arabic.

1565
01:24:26.02 --> 01:24:27.02
Right.

1566
01:24:27.02 --> 01:24:30.02
And so we call them jundies, that's what they call themselves jundies.

1567
01:24:30.02 --> 01:24:34.02
So we had jundies, like you guys had little people, like you had in-ditch force.

1568
01:24:34.02 --> 01:24:36.02
We had in-ditch forces, they were jundies.

1569
01:24:36.02 --> 01:24:41.02
And so we would do very conventional missions with the jundies of them.

1570
01:24:41.02 --> 01:24:44.02
And us, you know, we'd be overseeing them as they cleared big sections of the city.

1571
01:24:44.02 --> 01:24:47.02
And we'd be working in conjunction with the army.

1572
01:24:47.02 --> 01:24:50.02
So yeah, we did a little bit of everything.

1573
01:24:50.02 --> 01:24:54.02
But, um, we see that brings us back to our side of it,

1574
01:24:54.02 --> 01:24:57.02
where you can give yourself a mental delusion,

1575
01:24:57.02 --> 01:25:02.02
which is our mission is to go look in an area recon.

1576
01:25:02.02 --> 01:25:06.02
So theoretically, you're going to get inserted quietly and go back to your job.

1577
01:25:06.02 --> 01:25:09.02
And that's different from you with your point of mission.

1578
01:25:09.02 --> 01:25:11.02
So hold different frame of mind.

1579
01:25:11.02 --> 01:25:15.02
So, theoretically, okay, we're hoping to get in to our mission to come back and report,

1580
01:25:15.02 --> 01:25:20.02
or find a fuel line, blow it up, or get the POW,

1581
01:25:20.02 --> 01:25:26.02
get the wire taps, give them a mental, where you're going out and doing your IED pick-up,

1582
01:25:26.02 --> 01:25:29.02
and mortars, that's totally different.

1583
01:25:29.02 --> 01:25:34.02
So at least in my mind, I think that's part of my self-confered factor.

1584
01:25:34.02 --> 01:25:38.02
We're going to get inserted and cover nice quiet mission for five or six days.

1585
01:25:38.02 --> 01:25:40.02
Takes some pictures.

1586
01:25:40.02 --> 01:25:41.02
That sounds great.

1587
01:25:41.02 --> 01:25:43.02
And come on back, it's really cool.

1588
01:25:43.02 --> 01:25:43.02
Yeah.

1589
01:25:43.02 --> 01:25:44.02
We're behind any mean line.

1590
01:25:44.02 --> 01:25:48.02
What percentage of operations would you guys get contacted on?

1591
01:25:48.02 --> 01:25:50.02
We left, always left under fire.

1592
01:25:50.02 --> 01:25:52.02
The only question was how much?

1593
01:25:52.02 --> 01:25:55.02
Never had, well, one.

1594
01:25:55.02 --> 01:26:01.02
They won, where we got, you opened up our discussion tonight, where we got pulled out.

1595
01:26:01.02 --> 01:26:03.02
There's no fire there because they came in and got us.

1596
01:26:03.02 --> 01:26:09.02
We had a great RON, and we were going to get some POWs, but they pulled us out right away.

1597
01:26:09.02 --> 01:26:13.02
So it's no gunfire in that mission, but other than that, every time we left under gunfire,

1598
01:26:13.02 --> 01:26:15.02
it's only a question of how much.

1599
01:26:15.02 --> 01:26:18.02
Some titles like the whole John Lowe light enough.

1600
01:26:18.02 --> 01:26:20.02
Sometimes it'll only be two or three hundred.

1601
01:26:20.02 --> 01:26:22.02
And yet you still fooled yourself with the thinking,

1602
01:26:22.02 --> 01:26:26.02
hey, this recon is going to be different.

1603
01:26:26.02 --> 01:26:32.02
But yeah, so I guess my point was I looked at it, and I still look at it.

1604
01:26:32.02 --> 01:26:37.02
If you are nervous about getting hurt, if you're nervous about something going wrong,

1605
01:26:37.02 --> 01:26:39.02
to me, that's when something goes wrong.

1606
01:26:39.02 --> 01:26:40.02
Yeah.

1607
01:26:40.02 --> 01:26:43.02
When you're nervous about it, now I'm not saying you should be arrogant about it and think,

1608
01:26:43.02 --> 01:26:45.02
oh, we're going to get away with whatever.

1609
01:26:45.02 --> 01:26:50.02
But I'm saying, like when you're doing a sport, you know,

1610
01:26:50.02 --> 01:26:54.02
when you're doing some physical activity, if you're afraid, you might get injured.

1611
01:26:54.02 --> 01:26:56.02
To me, that's when you get injured.

1612
01:26:56.02 --> 01:27:01.02
It's when you're, when you're afraid, I think fear can hurt you.

1613
01:27:01.02 --> 01:27:05.02
And that being said, the other side of the coin is, if you have no fear,

1614
01:27:05.02 --> 01:27:07.02
well, you're definitely at risk.

1615
01:27:07.02 --> 01:27:09.02
He who has a taste is lost.

1616
01:27:09.02 --> 01:27:10.02
There you go.

1617
01:27:10.02 --> 01:27:11.02
So there's a dichotomy there.

1618
01:27:11.02 --> 01:27:12.02
That's not a good balance.

1619
01:27:12.02 --> 01:27:14.02
Yeah, and that's where we're so lucky.

1620
01:27:14.02 --> 01:27:18.02
You know, heept a sale that a great job of vetting our indigenous troops,

1621
01:27:18.02 --> 01:27:22.02
and to go from spider parks to walk in to Baba,

1622
01:27:22.02 --> 01:27:26.02
and then back to Limbac, and then when I left the team,

1623
01:27:26.02 --> 01:27:28.02
it was in Lens Hands.

1624
01:27:28.02 --> 01:27:31.02
And then I came back, Lens the ones, you know,

1625
01:27:31.02 --> 01:27:33.02
what more could you ask for?

1626
01:27:33.02 --> 01:27:36.02
So that was just a very fortunate.

1627
01:27:36.02 --> 01:27:39.02
What was your mission planning like?

1628
01:27:39.02 --> 01:27:41.02
So you guys get a tasking?

1629
01:27:41.02 --> 01:27:44.02
How long did you guys plan for?

1630
01:27:44.02 --> 01:27:48.02
For just an area mission, area reconcest, very little.

1631
01:27:48.02 --> 01:27:52.02
With the wire tabs, obviously we did hours and hours of training on that.

1632
01:27:52.02 --> 01:27:56.02
And then as time went on, you know, first it was just sale,

1633
01:27:56.02 --> 01:27:58.02
who could do it, and then sale trained,

1634
01:27:58.02 --> 01:28:02.02
have and fuck the guys are as strong to do it all.

1635
01:28:02.02 --> 01:28:05.02
And as well, every aspect of it,

1636
01:28:05.02 --> 01:28:07.02
and then we cross trained each other.

1637
01:28:07.02 --> 01:28:09.02
And we even had so that,

1638
01:28:09.02 --> 01:28:14.02
we had to begin to teach a couple of young guys basic English.

1639
01:28:14.02 --> 01:28:16.02
So if any of us got killed,

1640
01:28:16.02 --> 01:28:20.02
had to take over to radio, or the end did to take over.

1641
01:28:20.02 --> 01:28:22.02
So a couple of guys that like,

1642
01:28:22.02 --> 01:28:24.02
chow and hung, as it went,

1643
01:28:24.02 --> 01:28:25.02
hung came on the team.

1644
01:28:25.02 --> 01:28:27.02
They picked up being was pretty quick.

1645
01:28:27.02 --> 01:28:28.02
So we worked with them.

1646
01:28:28.02 --> 01:28:31.02
And we practiced calling in, working on the radio,

1647
01:28:31.02 --> 01:28:33.02
the problems with the batteries, and things like that.

1648
01:28:33.02 --> 01:28:36.02
So we crossed trained everything back and forth.

1649
01:28:36.02 --> 01:28:40.02
And the wire tab was one of the particular ones where we had several guys in the team

1650
01:28:40.02 --> 01:28:41.02
trained up to do it all.

1651
01:28:41.02 --> 01:28:44.02
Everything from known about the batteries, watching it,

1652
01:28:44.02 --> 01:28:49.02
keeping the battery indicator to get to put the wire up the tree

1653
01:28:49.02 --> 01:28:51.02
or a telephone pole.

1654
01:28:51.02 --> 01:28:52.02
And when you came down to your cover,

1655
01:28:52.02 --> 01:28:55.02
that was from that area.

1656
01:28:55.02 --> 01:28:58.02
So it looked like it was part of that area, trying to cover the wire.

1657
01:28:58.02 --> 01:29:01.02
But as far as the actual mission planning of,

1658
01:29:01.02 --> 01:29:04.02
okay, here's where we're going in tonight.

1659
01:29:04.02 --> 01:29:09.02
They didn't take you much because you were running repetitive type missions.

1660
01:29:09.02 --> 01:29:11.02
It's a high degree of similarity.

1661
01:29:11.02 --> 01:29:13.02
The most important thing was the training.

1662
01:29:13.02 --> 01:29:17.02
So when you may contact, you could take care of yourself and

1663
01:29:17.02 --> 01:29:20.02
how to react, try to continue the mission.

1664
01:29:20.02 --> 01:29:22.02
But these were like reconnaissance.

1665
01:29:22.02 --> 01:29:27.02
So once you've been seen or compromised, the mission's compromised.

1666
01:29:27.02 --> 01:29:31.02
Would you be flying in?

1667
01:29:31.02 --> 01:29:35.02
What was your degree of certainty on where you were inserted?

1668
01:29:35.02 --> 01:29:38.02
Oh, we knew very clear where we were gone.

1669
01:29:38.02 --> 01:29:41.02
So like in the case, we talked to Kavi.

1670
01:29:41.02 --> 01:29:44.02
We sent the three LZs down to Saigon.

1671
01:29:44.02 --> 01:29:46.02
And Kavi would go pick a site.

1672
01:29:46.02 --> 01:29:50.02
And then he would tell me on the radio, okay, this is where we're gone.

1673
01:29:50.02 --> 01:29:53.02
And would you be looking at your map as you started?

1674
01:29:53.02 --> 01:29:55.02
And he knew what the frame was.

1675
01:29:55.02 --> 01:29:57.02
So it would be in that map.

1676
01:29:57.02 --> 01:29:58.02
Yeah.

1677
01:29:58.02 --> 01:30:01.02
That we would have sexed them out that we could.

1678
01:30:01.02 --> 01:30:05.02
I remember when we first, you know, as a radioman, believe it or not,

1679
01:30:05.02 --> 01:30:10.02
when GPS's first came out, the radioman kind of got saddled with the GPS

1680
01:30:10.02 --> 01:30:12.02
because it was a piece of electronic equipment.

1681
01:30:12.02 --> 01:30:15.02
No one else could work with electronic equipment.

1682
01:30:15.02 --> 01:30:19.02
So I would be usually a lot of times be carrying the GPS as opposed to the

1683
01:30:19.02 --> 01:30:20.02
point meant.

1684
01:30:20.02 --> 01:30:23.02
And the point man, you know, was still using mapping compasses that early

1685
01:30:23.02 --> 01:30:28.02
in the early 90s. But the GPS wouldn't always work well in a helicopter.

1686
01:30:28.02 --> 01:30:34.02
And so sometimes they took me, you know, this is some training operations where I learned

1687
01:30:34.02 --> 01:30:36.02
oh, so I'm not what I think I am.

1688
01:30:36.02 --> 01:30:40.02
And you get out and that GPS finally finds itself and you realize your three

1689
01:30:40.02 --> 01:30:43.02
clicks away from where you're supposed to be or whatever and it's bad.

1690
01:30:43.02 --> 01:30:47.02
And that's why we'd go, I went back to, hey, when I'm in the helicopter, I'm on a map.

1691
01:30:47.02 --> 01:30:50.02
So that way when my boss looks at me and says, hey, we're we're we're we're

1692
01:30:50.02 --> 01:30:55.02
supposed to be either yes or no, like don't get out of the bird or okay, we're good.

1693
01:30:55.02 --> 01:31:00.02
But but that. So I was thinking about that for you guys. You'd be doing the same thing

1694
01:31:00.02 --> 01:31:03.02
as you approach to okay, yep, there's that train feature. There's this other train

1695
01:31:03.02 --> 01:31:06.02
feature, cool where we're we're we're supposed to be.

1696
01:31:06.02 --> 01:31:10.02
Yeah, and then last also we wanted to know what a water was because some of the

1697
01:31:10.02 --> 01:31:14.02
targets they had more more streams of things. So we carry less water. I will

1698
01:31:14.02 --> 01:31:18.02
literally just carry one canteen with the purification pills so that we're in for

1699
01:31:18.02 --> 01:31:23.02
several days like with Echo 4. But at the first day, we had gone through some water

1700
01:31:23.02 --> 01:31:28.02
and took we all took a turn going into the little stream put the purification

1701
01:31:28.02 --> 01:31:32.02
pills in hit the water and let it sit for a couple of hours before you

1702
01:31:32.02 --> 01:31:36.02
drank it. Did you get acclimated where you needed less water? Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1703
01:31:36.02 --> 01:31:42.02
Less water and I can truly say I never defecate and lay us.

1704
01:31:42.02 --> 01:31:49.02
Somehow the body just tightened up and they had no ship pills that guys would

1705
01:31:49.02 --> 01:31:55.02
take so they literally would not go to the bathroom. I worried about those.

1706
01:31:55.02 --> 01:32:00.02
Yeah, that wouldn't help me there. Oh, yeah. I was like, anyway, for numerous reasons

1707
01:32:00.02 --> 01:32:05.02
that the creative mind can think about. But so I didn't but my body never had

1708
01:32:05.02 --> 01:32:09.02
and then we never did it. And the you guys didn't.

1709
01:32:09.02 --> 01:32:16.02
Did you guys have you guys did you guys use imagery at all? Like overhead imagery?

1710
01:32:16.02 --> 01:32:24.02
Nothing. No, some of the, uh, uh, the cobras. No, no, some of the first

1711
01:32:24.02 --> 01:32:34.02
calf pillow copters had some, uh, a trying to think what I are. They would have, uh,

1712
01:32:34.02 --> 01:32:40.02
the ability to see through the clouds and stuff. Okay. And it was just a very

1713
01:32:40.02 --> 01:32:44.02
primitive boat beginning, uh, whereas the cobras gunsters didn't have it.

1714
01:32:44.02 --> 01:32:49.02
But the first calf could get low into the jungle and navigate and fog and

1715
01:32:49.02 --> 01:32:54.02
stuff to get down to our guys. But no, you guys wouldn't see photographs of

1716
01:32:54.02 --> 01:32:58.02
the areas where you were going into it all. No, the only time was down in

1717
01:32:58.02 --> 01:33:04.02
the camp, but for that misnare where that was, um, that base was really close to

1718
01:33:04.02 --> 01:33:09.02
Saigon close to Mac Veehead quarters. And, um, we may have had overviews.

1719
01:33:09.02 --> 01:33:14.02
I just forget for up north that one down there. I stuck stuck on my mind.

1720
01:33:14.02 --> 01:33:18.02
And then what was your, what was your optempo like? In other words,

1721
01:33:18.02 --> 01:33:23.02
how often were you going in the field? Well, through an November, December,

1722
01:33:23.02 --> 01:33:28.02
we, if we weren't on the, if we weren't on the ground, we were getting ready to go back

1723
01:33:28.02 --> 01:33:33.02
to next day. That's why it was such a push, push, push, and I rotate our

1724
01:33:33.02 --> 01:33:37.02
little people out because they were just getting beat. And we had trained them up

1725
01:33:37.02 --> 01:33:41.02
so by November, December, all the cross training we had done in those months.

1726
01:33:41.02 --> 01:33:46.02
You know, South could take a day off, uh, even have to take a day off.

1727
01:33:46.02 --> 01:33:50.02
We had a couple of guys that could speak enough English. If anything happened to me

1728
01:33:50.02 --> 01:33:55.02
or Baba, they could take care of the radio due to comms. And, um, so we

1729
01:33:55.02 --> 01:34:00.02
rotate them through. But it was every day. And then, if the weather came,

1730
01:34:00.02 --> 01:34:06.02
we get a break. And, um, so there was no, and the rule that was, if you ran

1731
01:34:06.02 --> 01:34:10.02
on Mission for Five Days, you came back, you got five days off. So you could

1732
01:34:10.02 --> 01:34:14.02
clean up and get back and shape, get the team ready. But for that period of

1733
01:34:14.02 --> 01:34:19.02
time, we had minimal teams. The teams at F will be one had become so

1734
01:34:19.02 --> 01:34:26.02
between disease, um, health, guys getting wiped out, teams getting blown away.

1735
01:34:26.02 --> 01:34:31.02
Um, we were one of the few teams in campus fully operational. So that's why

1736
01:34:31.02 --> 01:34:35.02
that was the other pressure we had. I remember the S3 just saying, hey,

1737
01:34:35.02 --> 01:34:39.02
you're the only guys we got, you're going to see up the noon. Here's your target.

1738
01:34:39.02 --> 01:34:45.02
Go eat. Okay. So we did it. And then we got shot out and come back

1739
01:34:45.02 --> 01:34:51.02
the next day. And so there was no, there's the uptampal was supposed to be

1740
01:34:51.02 --> 01:34:55.02
rather than Mission for Five to Ten Days if you're lucky. Well, it never happened.

1741
01:34:55.02 --> 01:34:58.02
Some guys did. So they'll give me wrong. We had some guys that were able to

1742
01:34:58.02 --> 01:35:03.02
stay on the ground. Amazing. But in our case, we didn't. So it would be

1743
01:35:03.02 --> 01:35:09.02
very flexible. Then you really take less than less than six guys. A few

1744
01:35:09.02 --> 01:35:14.02
guys ran with four. And, uh, at the end of my tour duty, uh, second tour

1745
01:35:14.02 --> 01:35:18.02
I tried to format team, but we had this whole issue with the radio stuff.

1746
01:35:18.02 --> 01:35:22.02
Just so we could move faster. Just wanted to try anything. Something different

1747
01:35:22.02 --> 01:35:26.02
because when we had moved fast, we had success getting away from the LZ

1748
01:35:26.02 --> 01:35:32.02
and that caused them confusion. So if we broke what our SOPs were, it worked.

1749
01:35:32.02 --> 01:35:36.02
But the eight man was too much, too much. I felt more comfortable with six.

1750
01:35:36.02 --> 01:35:40.02
There was a lot of firepower. We had the M79 here. And then all the

1751
01:35:40.02 --> 01:35:45.02
Americans at the M79 too. And then how often would you get legitimate

1752
01:35:45.02 --> 01:35:51.02
R&R? You had one a year at one for a tour duty. You get five days

1753
01:35:51.02 --> 01:35:55.02
anywhere you want it. So I went to Hong Kong bought my stereo

1754
01:35:55.02 --> 01:35:59.02
by a time. It's a book of money set up. But a nice stereo,

1755
01:35:59.02 --> 01:36:04.02
stadium art, set a home to mom and dad. My little brother put it

1756
01:36:04.02 --> 01:36:08.02
together. He was good at that stuff. Yeah. And that's it. Other than that,

1757
01:36:08.02 --> 01:36:12.02
there's no one R&R. If we got net PllaW.

1758
01:36:12.02 --> 01:36:16.02
Then you would have gotten more. Yeah, we would have.

1759
01:36:16.02 --> 01:36:18.02
What was the offer for catching a bad guy?

1760
01:36:18.02 --> 01:36:20.02
An R&R anywhere is nowhere old. And you got a little hundred

1761
01:36:20.02 --> 01:36:22.02
dollars bonus. How many days?

1762
01:36:22.02 --> 01:36:24.02
Five. Like a regular R&R.

1763
01:36:24.02 --> 01:36:28.02
Oh yeah, it was. Oh yeah. That's why we lost it for that man.

1764
01:36:28.02 --> 01:36:31.02
I cried when it's about to say no.

1765
01:36:31.02 --> 01:36:34.02
A hundred bucks. How much was a hundred bucks? How much was your normal paycheck?

1766
01:36:34.02 --> 01:36:36.02
How much you make a month back then?

1767
01:36:36.02 --> 01:36:41.02
Oh, I don't know. When we went through jump school, now I'm only a private

1768
01:36:41.02 --> 01:36:45.02
E1 right. I got a hundred percent pay raise with my jump pay.

1769
01:36:45.02 --> 01:36:49.02
That's getting paid $50 a month. The jump pay was 55.

1770
01:36:49.02 --> 01:36:54.02
So 55 was a constant. Then later maybe E2 was like 75.

1771
01:36:54.02 --> 01:36:58.02
I never paid. It was never enough. So a hundred bucks was like a hundred bucks

1772
01:36:58.02 --> 01:37:01.02
was like a month to pay basically. Yeah, that was a lot of money.

1773
01:37:01.02 --> 01:37:04.02
Even then a scene that was a big deal.

1774
01:37:04.02 --> 01:37:10.02
Absolutely. And then when you guys would come back, you're talking about this.

1775
01:37:10.02 --> 01:37:13.02
How you would sit there in debrief. Would you debrief your team?

1776
01:37:13.02 --> 01:37:16.02
Would you guys sit down in debrief? What happened? What went wrong? What went right?

1777
01:37:16.02 --> 01:37:18.02
We always talk to a little people.

1778
01:37:18.02 --> 01:37:22.02
Maybe not right away because S2 would want to know what happened.

1779
01:37:22.02 --> 01:37:25.02
So we would go in for immediate debrief.

1780
01:37:25.02 --> 01:37:28.02
Go back to team, make sure they had food for the night and stuff.

1781
01:37:28.02 --> 01:37:32.02
And then go back for a final after action report,

1782
01:37:32.02 --> 01:37:36.02
which would go through talking about everything from the vegetation,

1783
01:37:36.02 --> 01:37:39.02
the type of hills, animals you encountered.

1784
01:37:39.02 --> 01:37:42.02
All that kind of just crazy stuff. The fauna.

1785
01:37:42.02 --> 01:37:45.02
Oh my god. The questions to you as it was just,

1786
01:37:45.02 --> 01:37:47.02
if the wild was like always the same.

1787
01:37:47.02 --> 01:37:49.02
It was the layoffs. Yeah, triple canopy.

1788
01:37:49.02 --> 01:37:52.02
It's pretty dangerous. The NBA are pretty dedicated.

1789
01:37:52.02 --> 01:37:56.02
And then anything specific solved the target from that

1790
01:37:56.02 --> 01:38:01.02
to take a learn from. How long are you going to take you to become the one zero?

1791
01:38:01.02 --> 01:38:06.02
Well, in my case, a gotten country in May.

1792
01:38:06.02 --> 01:38:10.02
Despite putting on a team at the end of May, we trained Juniors L.I.

1793
01:38:10.02 --> 01:38:14.02
had a couple in country like L'Oyem, Bush's locally.

1794
01:38:14.02 --> 01:38:19.02
And then we had a practice mission in August.

1795
01:38:19.02 --> 01:38:21.02
And then we did it. First wiretap.

1796
01:38:21.02 --> 01:38:23.02
And not a wiretap, but the Air Force sensors.

1797
01:38:23.02 --> 01:38:25.02
We did two of those missions in September.

1798
01:38:25.02 --> 01:38:27.02
We had them on soon, too.

1799
01:38:27.02 --> 01:38:30.02
So a lot of those little between the rain. We had like weeks.

1800
01:38:30.02 --> 01:38:33.02
We were just rain. It seemed like a rain every day.

1801
01:38:33.02 --> 01:38:37.02
You ever see who horizontal rain?

1802
01:38:37.02 --> 01:38:39.02
Yeah.

1803
01:38:39.02 --> 01:38:40.02
I've seen this much.

1804
01:38:40.02 --> 01:38:42.02
You guys would not run missions during the monsters.

1805
01:38:42.02 --> 01:38:43.02
No.

1806
01:38:43.02 --> 01:38:44.02
You're too much.

1807
01:38:44.02 --> 01:38:45.02
Too much.

1808
01:38:45.02 --> 01:38:46.02
You're going to be too bad.

1809
01:38:46.02 --> 01:38:47.02
You're socked.

1810
01:38:47.02 --> 01:38:48.02
You're socked.

1811
01:38:48.02 --> 01:38:49.02
You couldn't get out of the base.

1812
01:38:49.02 --> 01:38:51.02
The king, he couldn't get to the base.

1813
01:38:51.02 --> 01:38:53.02
So how long, so how long was that?

1814
01:38:53.02 --> 01:38:55.02
Like four months before you were?

1815
01:38:55.02 --> 01:38:56.02
Yeah.

1816
01:38:56.02 --> 01:38:57.02
Four months.

1817
01:38:57.02 --> 01:39:02.02
And how many missions did you run before you were a one zero?

1818
01:39:02.02 --> 01:39:04.02
I had five missions out of my belt.

1819
01:39:04.02 --> 01:39:08.02
We had a two practice, two wiretaps,

1820
01:39:08.02 --> 01:39:11.02
and a dawn, walkin, echo four.

1821
01:39:11.02 --> 01:39:15.02
And by that time, when he came to me, he said,

1822
01:39:15.02 --> 01:39:18.02
you know, walkin got promoted to a cubby rider.

1823
01:39:18.02 --> 01:39:21.02
And because Pat Walkas was leaving,

1824
01:39:21.02 --> 01:39:22.02
there's an opening.

1825
01:39:22.02 --> 01:39:25.02
So he went there and they gave me the option.

1826
01:39:25.02 --> 01:39:26.02
Are you ready?

1827
01:39:26.02 --> 01:39:29.02
Well, we see what happened with Alabama with Lynn Black,

1828
01:39:29.02 --> 01:39:34.02
in October when they put a guy on a team that didn't had no experience.

1829
01:39:34.02 --> 01:39:37.02
So I talked it over with happened south.

1830
01:39:37.02 --> 01:39:39.02
I saw a look just a situation.

1831
01:39:39.02 --> 01:39:41.02
I don't know who they're going to give us.

1832
01:39:41.02 --> 01:39:44.02
So what about I'll be the ones here on spider.

1833
01:39:44.02 --> 01:39:47.02
I thought that was okay to do it.

1834
01:39:47.02 --> 01:39:48.02
Talk to Walkins.

1835
01:39:48.02 --> 01:39:51.02
And they all said, well, you're ready.

1836
01:39:51.02 --> 01:39:53.02
If you want to try it.

1837
01:39:53.02 --> 01:39:57.02
And we didn't know who could they had to do people coming in the camp.

1838
01:39:57.02 --> 01:40:01.02
And some of these guys were the older ones who had no experience in the layoffs.

1839
01:40:01.02 --> 01:40:03.02
But they didn't want to think to do with them.

1840
01:40:03.02 --> 01:40:05.02
And it had some of the younger guys who were coming in.

1841
01:40:05.02 --> 01:40:09.02
Like Jim Robison, who was on the team.

1842
01:40:09.02 --> 01:40:11.02
For one mission.

1843
01:40:11.02 --> 01:40:14.02
And we didn't know how to withstand up.

1844
01:40:14.02 --> 01:40:16.02
So our guys were happy.

1845
01:40:16.02 --> 01:40:17.02
And the bubbly came in.

1846
01:40:17.02 --> 01:40:21.02
Bubba and the guy named Defranceman Doug Leterna,

1847
01:40:21.02 --> 01:40:23.02
the Frenchman came in together.

1848
01:40:23.02 --> 01:40:25.02
And the Frenchman got picked for Virginia.

1849
01:40:25.02 --> 01:40:27.02
And I got Bubba.

1850
01:40:27.02 --> 01:40:29.02
They were buddies. They got me training group together.

1851
01:40:29.02 --> 01:40:31.02
Yeah, that's, yeah.

1852
01:40:31.02 --> 01:40:35.02
So you'd been in the army for like a couple years.

1853
01:40:35.02 --> 01:40:39.02
And you were in charge of a re-conte.

1854
01:40:39.02 --> 01:40:40.02
Yeah, got in the army.

1855
01:40:40.02 --> 01:40:43.02
December 66 became a one-to-year-old October 68.

1856
01:40:43.02 --> 01:40:45.02
So you figure...

1857
01:40:45.02 --> 01:40:45.02
Three years.

1858
01:40:45.02 --> 01:40:47.02
Almost two years, yeah.

1859
01:40:47.02 --> 01:40:52.02
Because the whole SF training, between that and going through basic jump school.

1860
01:40:52.02 --> 01:40:55.02
And then we had that training before Vietnam,

1861
01:40:55.02 --> 01:40:58.02
the RTT training, which was different.

1862
01:40:58.02 --> 01:41:01.02
But that's just because we're common geeks.

1863
01:41:01.02 --> 01:41:02.02
Mm-hmm.

1864
01:41:02.02 --> 01:41:04.02
Oh, the RTT training was just radio.

1865
01:41:04.02 --> 01:41:06.02
Radio tall type. Got it.

1866
01:41:06.02 --> 01:41:09.02
They want a top secret clearance men on those machines.

1867
01:41:09.02 --> 01:41:15.02
How much did you see the tactics that you guys were using?

1868
01:41:15.02 --> 01:41:18.02
Change over time.

1869
01:41:18.02 --> 01:41:24.02
Um, I think by the time, like when you read, we few by Nick Brockhausen.

1870
01:41:24.02 --> 01:41:30.02
Some of those guys were all carrying either RPDs or an M60.

1871
01:41:30.02 --> 01:41:31.02
Mm-hmm.

1872
01:41:31.02 --> 01:41:33.02
So they were just going in heavier.

1873
01:41:33.02 --> 01:41:36.02
And, um, they were going to bigger team.

1874
01:41:36.02 --> 01:41:37.02
Mm-hmm.

1875
01:41:37.02 --> 01:41:41.02
And, um, they were just anticipating the contact more.

1876
01:41:41.02 --> 01:41:45.02
Whereas we thought we were trying to go in and try to escape and evade.

1877
01:41:45.02 --> 01:41:46.02
Mm-hmm.

1878
01:41:46.02 --> 01:41:48.02
To a point where you hope that you can get these some in the mission done.

1879
01:41:48.02 --> 01:41:52.02
Or to get some intel reports about troop movements, trucks, stuff like that.

1880
01:41:52.02 --> 01:41:54.02
Or get a good wiretap.

1881
01:41:54.02 --> 01:41:59.02
So the biggest thing that changed was the guy started going in heavier and actually bringing

1882
01:41:59.02 --> 01:42:03.02
automatic weapons or belt-fed machine guns.

1883
01:42:03.02 --> 01:42:04.02
Sure.

1884
01:42:04.02 --> 01:42:05.02
That makes sense.

1885
01:42:05.02 --> 01:42:07.02
Every single time I read any of your operations,

1886
01:42:07.02 --> 01:42:11.02
I want nothing more than a belt-fed machine gun.

1887
01:42:11.02 --> 01:42:13.02
So the weaves, if we didn't know who's going to carry it.

1888
01:42:13.02 --> 01:42:15.02
Yeah, the seals had the stoner.

1889
01:42:15.02 --> 01:42:16.02
Oh, yeah.

1890
01:42:16.02 --> 01:42:18.02
Did you guys ever think about using that?

1891
01:42:18.02 --> 01:42:19.02
We thought about it a lot.

1892
01:42:19.02 --> 01:42:21.02
But, and it was a great system.

1893
01:42:21.02 --> 01:42:24.02
We heard many great reports about it.

1894
01:42:24.02 --> 01:42:27.02
But again, the stoner system, you need the audio ammo.

1895
01:42:27.02 --> 01:42:30.02
You had to get the supply system set up.

1896
01:42:30.02 --> 01:42:33.02
And we just weren't sure if we were going to be able to get the guarantee.

1897
01:42:33.02 --> 01:42:36.02
If we convert it, who would it be just the Americans?

1898
01:42:36.02 --> 01:42:39.02
We want everybody with common weapons.

1899
01:42:39.02 --> 01:42:41.02
So that somebody who's blown up, they're weapon,

1900
01:42:41.02 --> 01:42:44.02
because they know how to use the other guy's weapon.

1901
01:42:44.02 --> 01:42:46.02
And you have the same magazine saying that.

1902
01:42:46.02 --> 01:42:47.02
Everything.

1903
01:42:47.02 --> 01:42:48.02
Sure.

1904
01:42:48.02 --> 01:42:53.02
And what about the mission set itself?

1905
01:42:53.02 --> 01:42:59.02
Did you guys, did you notice that change over time while you were there?

1906
01:42:59.02 --> 01:43:03.02
Later we began to get more point targets like in on a ground.

1907
01:43:03.02 --> 01:43:06.02
One of my favorite stories was the Frenchman.

1908
01:43:06.02 --> 01:43:10.02
He goes into a seal-type mission.

1909
01:43:10.02 --> 01:43:13.02
The CIA comes and says, we know about the NVA.

1910
01:43:13.02 --> 01:43:17.02
They're floating 55 gallon drums down the river

1911
01:43:17.02 --> 01:43:19.02
and to a storage area.

1912
01:43:19.02 --> 01:43:21.02
Deep and lay us.

1913
01:43:21.02 --> 01:43:23.02
So we want you guys to go in.

1914
01:43:23.02 --> 01:43:25.02
But we don't trust you with the device.

1915
01:43:25.02 --> 01:43:29.02
They had a device that they screwed into a 55 gallon drum.

1916
01:43:29.02 --> 01:43:31.02
So what we're going to do is,

1917
01:43:31.02 --> 01:43:33.02
and that would be like a tracking device?

1918
01:43:33.02 --> 01:43:35.02
No, no, explosive in nature.

1919
01:43:35.02 --> 01:43:36.02
Oh, that's right. That's right.

1920
01:43:36.02 --> 01:43:37.02
Yeah, that's okay.

1921
01:43:37.02 --> 01:43:42.02
So here's what says, we're going to meet you on this hilltop in Lay Us.

1922
01:43:42.02 --> 01:43:46.02
So Doug was the one-one on our TV Junior.

1923
01:43:46.02 --> 01:43:48.02
Got their wall was the one-zero.

1924
01:43:48.02 --> 01:43:50.02
They'd go in and hump three days.

1925
01:43:50.02 --> 01:43:51.02
Get to the mountaintop.

1926
01:43:51.02 --> 01:43:53.02
There's the CIA.

1927
01:43:53.02 --> 01:43:54.02
With a couple guys.

1928
01:43:54.02 --> 01:43:56.02
Okay, here's your device.

1929
01:43:56.02 --> 01:43:58.02
Go and stall it.

1930
01:43:58.02 --> 01:44:02.02
Now, come to the wall with the Marine. So you think that he'd be the guy doing a swimming, right?

1931
01:44:02.02 --> 01:44:04.02
He goes, omınise six.

1932
01:44:04.02 --> 01:44:06.02
Frenchman, you're an E4.

1933
01:44:06.02 --> 01:44:08.02
Hit the work.

1934
01:44:08.02 --> 01:44:10.02
So the CIA gave the Disclosive device,

1935
01:44:10.02 --> 01:44:12.02
humped down the mount and get to the river

1936
01:44:12.02 --> 01:44:16.02
and then now they're on a river with all the stuff going by the drums.

1937
01:44:16.02 --> 01:44:20.02
And some have NVA troops riding the drums

1938
01:44:20.02 --> 01:44:22.02
or being present with a boat or something.

1939
01:44:22.02 --> 01:44:25.02
So in between all this, Doug strips down,

1940
01:44:25.02 --> 01:44:29.02
goes in, gets a drum, brings it back, puts in the explosive device.

1941
01:44:29.02 --> 01:44:35.02
Swims it back out and comes back, soaking wet and not happy.

1942
01:44:35.02 --> 01:44:38.02
He's for something California.

1943
01:44:38.02 --> 01:44:40.02
So he's really not happy.

1944
01:44:40.02 --> 01:44:44.02
But two days later, they're getting extracted now.

1945
01:44:44.02 --> 01:44:47.02
The King Beast come extracted and they're getting

1946
01:44:47.02 --> 01:44:50.02
the extracted as his use explosion.

1947
01:44:50.02 --> 01:44:54.02
And it had sonic boom that Lily moved the aircraft

1948
01:44:54.02 --> 01:44:57.02
and the guys running the strings swinging from the sonic boom

1949
01:44:57.02 --> 01:45:00.02
look back there goes a fuel dump.

1950
01:45:00.02 --> 01:45:01.02
Wow.

1951
01:45:01.02 --> 01:45:02.02
Beautiful mission.

1952
01:45:02.02 --> 01:45:03.02
Yeah, that's true.

1953
01:45:03.02 --> 01:45:04.02
So those are kind.

1954
01:45:04.02 --> 01:45:06.02
So the point mission, the wire taps, you can

1955
01:45:06.02 --> 01:45:09.02
pipe lines, we have more reports of pipe lines.

1956
01:45:09.02 --> 01:45:12.02
And then also there are doing some trail work trying to figure out

1957
01:45:12.02 --> 01:45:15.02
how to look like a beer stream.

1958
01:45:15.02 --> 01:45:18.02
But they had things, that's one of our missions of what the work

1959
01:45:18.02 --> 01:45:19.02
of the mission.

1960
01:45:19.02 --> 01:45:20.02
Yeah.

1961
01:45:20.02 --> 01:45:22.02
To get in there to see how to go into the food,

1962
01:45:22.02 --> 01:45:24.02
putter and could you go in and while you're there,

1963
01:45:24.02 --> 01:45:26.02
blow it up, maybe with a chuck on it.

1964
01:45:26.02 --> 01:45:27.02
Sure.

1965
01:45:27.02 --> 01:45:31.02
Let's talk a little bit about gear.

1966
01:45:31.02 --> 01:45:34.02
And you put, you actually have a section in saw

1967
01:45:34.02 --> 01:45:36.02
Chronicles and it's in across defense too, where you talk about

1968
01:45:36.02 --> 01:45:39.02
stuff you carry and stuff that you didn't carry.

1969
01:45:39.02 --> 01:45:42.02
And some of the stuff that you didn't carry.

1970
01:45:42.02 --> 01:45:44.02
No underwear.

1971
01:45:44.02 --> 01:45:45.02
Never.

1972
01:45:45.02 --> 01:45:46.02
No socks.

1973
01:45:46.02 --> 01:45:47.02
Never.

1974
01:45:47.02 --> 01:45:51.02
And that's because you just want to stay dry as much as

1975
01:45:51.02 --> 01:45:52.02
possible.

1976
01:45:52.02 --> 01:45:53.02
Yeah.

1977
01:45:53.02 --> 01:45:56.02
And both those things just hold water and keep moisture in.

1978
01:45:56.02 --> 01:45:57.02
Yeah.

1979
01:45:57.02 --> 01:46:00.02
And then black when he came,

1980
01:46:00.02 --> 01:46:03.02
or had a maid that was stealing all my underwear.

1981
01:46:03.02 --> 01:46:05.02
Because I went over with eight or ten pair of the

1982
01:46:05.02 --> 01:46:07.02
jockey shorts, right?

1983
01:46:07.02 --> 01:46:10.02
And so I was down on my last pair.

1984
01:46:10.02 --> 01:46:12.02
And the maid was literally stealing, could they

1985
01:46:12.02 --> 01:46:14.02
sell one of black market, they're relatively clean,

1986
01:46:14.02 --> 01:46:15.02
relatively new.

1987
01:46:15.02 --> 01:46:18.02
Mom bought me a whole bunch of stuff with socks and everything.

1988
01:46:18.02 --> 01:46:20.02
So we had our army socks.

1989
01:46:20.02 --> 01:46:22.02
So anyways, I talked to the men.

1990
01:46:22.02 --> 01:46:25.02
I said, I can't believe my maid's been stealing my underwear.

1991
01:46:25.02 --> 01:46:27.02
Because we pulled down in a little eye down.

1992
01:46:27.02 --> 01:46:28.02
There's my underwear.

1993
01:46:28.02 --> 01:46:31.02
So I said, here, take the last one, have a good day.

1994
01:46:31.02 --> 01:46:33.02
And lingo, don't wear that stuff because you get

1995
01:46:33.02 --> 01:46:35.02
jungle rotten, crotch rot.

1996
01:46:35.02 --> 01:46:39.02
And he says same thing, put away your socks.

1997
01:46:39.02 --> 01:46:42.02
Well, you know, it first couple weeks, the jungle boots were

1998
01:46:42.02 --> 01:46:44.02
really tough on my feet, but he was right.

1999
01:46:44.02 --> 01:46:46.02
Yeah, once you get a bunch of your feet broken in and

2000
01:46:46.02 --> 01:46:47.02
you jungle boots broken in.

2001
01:46:47.02 --> 01:46:48.02
Yeah.

2002
01:46:48.02 --> 01:46:51.02
And then say, you go through the water, we did some very

2003
01:46:51.02 --> 01:46:52.02
in country stuff.

2004
01:46:52.02 --> 01:46:53.02
We were in the rice patties.

2005
01:46:53.02 --> 01:46:54.02
Oh my God.

2006
01:46:54.02 --> 01:46:56.02
But they would dry out quicker.

2007
01:46:56.02 --> 01:46:58.02
You'd have to worry about the socks.

2008
01:46:58.02 --> 01:47:00.02
So no helmet.

2009
01:47:00.02 --> 01:47:01.02
Never.

2010
01:47:01.02 --> 01:47:02.02
No body armor.

2011
01:47:02.02 --> 01:47:04.02
No, and your body armor sucked back.

2012
01:47:04.02 --> 01:47:05.02
It sucked back.

2013
01:47:05.02 --> 01:47:06.02
That was big.

2014
01:47:06.02 --> 01:47:07.02
You just have you a different level.

2015
01:47:07.02 --> 01:47:08.02
It didn't work.

2016
01:47:08.02 --> 01:47:12.02
No entrenching tool.

2017
01:47:12.02 --> 01:47:13.02
Never.

2018
01:47:13.02 --> 01:47:16.02
No bay in that.

2019
01:47:16.02 --> 01:47:18.02
No sleeping bag.

2020
01:47:18.02 --> 01:47:19.02
No hammock.

2021
01:47:19.02 --> 01:47:20.02
No poncho.

2022
01:47:20.02 --> 01:47:21.02
No poncho.

2023
01:47:21.02 --> 01:47:22.02
No ground bat.

2024
01:47:22.02 --> 01:47:23.02
Correct.

2025
01:47:23.02 --> 01:47:24.02
You were not traveling for comfort.

2026
01:47:24.02 --> 01:47:25.02
Never.

2027
01:47:25.02 --> 01:47:27.02
We had to carry it.

2028
01:47:27.02 --> 01:47:29.02
Did you know that feeling?

2029
01:47:29.02 --> 01:47:30.02
Yeah.

2030
01:47:30.02 --> 01:47:32.02
What you're taking to the field, your carrying.

2031
01:47:32.02 --> 01:47:33.02
You don't have your maverick.

2032
01:47:33.02 --> 01:47:34.02
Yeah.

2033
01:47:34.02 --> 01:47:36.02
That that rucksack gets heavy too.

2034
01:47:36.02 --> 01:47:37.02
So quick.

2035
01:47:37.02 --> 01:47:38.02
Yeah.

2036
01:47:38.02 --> 01:47:40.02
And ours is like small.

2037
01:47:40.02 --> 01:47:42.02
We had the indigenous rucksacks.

2038
01:47:42.02 --> 01:47:43.02
Uh huh.

2039
01:47:43.02 --> 01:47:45.02
And so you want you put the radio and put the sweater on the

2040
01:47:45.02 --> 01:47:46.02
needle radio.

2041
01:47:46.02 --> 01:47:48.02
So it protect your back.

2042
01:47:48.02 --> 01:47:49.02
And they throw some rations.

2043
01:47:49.02 --> 01:47:53.02
Extra couple of extra amma magazines in there.

2044
01:47:53.02 --> 01:47:55.02
And then extra hand grenades.

2045
01:47:55.02 --> 01:47:57.02
I'm setting on rounds.

2046
01:47:57.02 --> 01:47:59.02
And a battery for good luck.

2047
01:47:59.02 --> 01:48:00.02
Man.

2048
01:48:00.02 --> 01:48:01.02
Yeah.

2049
01:48:01.02 --> 01:48:03.02
You guys.

2050
01:48:03.02 --> 01:48:04.02
No dog tags.

2051
01:48:04.02 --> 01:48:06.02
No military idea of any kind.

2052
01:48:06.02 --> 01:48:07.02
No rank.

2053
01:48:07.02 --> 01:48:08.02
No name tags.

2054
01:48:08.02 --> 01:48:09.02
No jump.

2055
01:48:09.02 --> 01:48:10.02
No C.I.B.

2056
01:48:10.02 --> 01:48:11.02
No patches.

2057
01:48:11.02 --> 01:48:12.02
No unit identified.

2058
01:48:12.02 --> 01:48:13.02
No pictures.

2059
01:48:13.02 --> 01:48:14.02
No mama.

2060
01:48:14.02 --> 01:48:15.02
Right.

2061
01:48:15.02 --> 01:48:16.02
Totally select.

2062
01:48:16.02 --> 01:48:18.02
So those are the things you didn't carry.

2063
01:48:18.02 --> 01:48:19.02
Things you didn't carry.

2064
01:48:19.02 --> 01:48:20.02
Car 15.

2065
01:48:20.02 --> 01:48:21.02
Uh love it.

2066
01:48:21.02 --> 01:48:22.02
You love the car 15.

2067
01:48:22.02 --> 01:48:23.02
Oh yeah.

2068
01:48:23.02 --> 01:48:25.02
So back my second tour.

2069
01:48:25.02 --> 01:48:26.02
Rock Myers was in S4.

2070
01:48:26.02 --> 01:48:29.02
He's he been wounded.

2071
01:48:29.02 --> 01:48:30.02
I came back.

2072
01:48:30.02 --> 01:48:31.02
He says you're back.

2073
01:48:31.02 --> 01:48:32.02
I got a present for you.

2074
01:48:32.02 --> 01:48:34.02
He gave me a brand new car 15.

2075
01:48:34.02 --> 01:48:35.02
I was stolen the box.

2076
01:48:35.02 --> 01:48:36.02
Take it out.

2077
01:48:36.02 --> 01:48:39.02
It's stolen it all the 10 foil and all the oils and grease isn't stuff.

2078
01:48:39.02 --> 01:48:40.02
And you take it out.

2079
01:48:40.02 --> 01:48:41.02
Took it down through range.

2080
01:48:41.02 --> 01:48:42.02
It was perfectly zero.

2081
01:48:42.02 --> 01:48:43.02
Never touched that one.

2082
01:48:43.02 --> 01:48:44.02
It was crazy.

2083
01:48:44.02 --> 01:48:48.02
Just put a little claw strap on it and went to work.

2084
01:48:48.02 --> 01:48:51.02
And you never had problems with that weapon.

2085
01:48:51.02 --> 01:48:52.02
Never.

2086
01:48:52.02 --> 01:48:53.02
Yeah.

2087
01:48:53.02 --> 01:48:56.02
Did you have a four to six on it?

2088
01:48:56.02 --> 01:48:57.02
Yep.

2089
01:48:57.02 --> 01:48:58.02
Six four to six.

2090
01:48:58.02 --> 01:48:59.02
Yeah.

2091
01:48:59.02 --> 01:49:01.02
So that was a car 15.

2092
01:49:01.02 --> 01:49:02.02
Wow.

2093
01:49:02.02 --> 01:49:04.02
So the M16 with it with a classable stock.

2094
01:49:04.02 --> 01:49:05.02
Yeah.

2095
01:49:05.02 --> 01:49:06.02
And a shortened barrel.

2096
01:49:06.02 --> 01:49:07.02
Yeah.

2097
01:49:07.02 --> 01:49:11.02
So it's weird so many people and myself being one of them complain about the car.

2098
01:49:11.02 --> 01:49:14.02
The car 15 or the M4 frame.

2099
01:49:14.02 --> 01:49:15.02
Now the M4 is our lot nicer.

2100
01:49:15.02 --> 01:49:16.02
I mean, the M4.

2101
01:49:16.02 --> 01:49:17.02
Well, a lot heavier too.

2102
01:49:17.02 --> 01:49:18.02
You got to reels and everything.

2103
01:49:18.02 --> 01:49:19.02
Oh yeah.

2104
01:49:19.02 --> 01:49:20.02
We put the light note thing.

2105
01:49:20.02 --> 01:49:21.02
Those are the same.

2106
01:49:21.02 --> 01:49:23.02
You got everything but a cigarette lighter on here.

2107
01:49:23.02 --> 01:49:27.02
Some guys I would've resized it and then that on there too.

2108
01:49:27.02 --> 01:49:28.02
So that's awesome.

2109
01:49:28.02 --> 01:49:30.02
You used the Kravat for your sling.

2110
01:49:30.02 --> 01:49:31.02
Yes.

2111
01:49:31.02 --> 01:49:32.02
So I thought, well, yeah.

2112
01:49:32.02 --> 01:49:34.02
I did that door my second door.

2113
01:49:34.02 --> 01:49:36.02
They had the Kravat's quiet.

2114
01:49:36.02 --> 01:49:40.02
And then God forbid if you ever needed a Kravat.

2115
01:49:40.02 --> 01:49:41.02
Mm-hmm.

2116
01:49:41.02 --> 01:49:42.02
Because I was carried out.

2117
01:49:42.02 --> 01:49:43.02
I always wore a run around my neck.

2118
01:49:43.02 --> 01:49:45.02
I had one on my head.

2119
01:49:45.02 --> 01:49:46.02
And then one on the car 15.

2120
01:49:46.02 --> 01:49:48.02
And of course you carried bandages.

2121
01:49:48.02 --> 01:49:49.02
Yeah.

2122
01:49:49.02 --> 01:49:50.02
We had Kravats in case it.

2123
01:49:50.02 --> 01:49:51.02
As at the very bottom of the rock sack.

2124
01:49:51.02 --> 01:49:55.02
We would get a sort of one of those things.

2125
01:49:55.02 --> 01:49:57.02
They'd never wear a sling.

2126
01:49:57.02 --> 01:49:58.02
Some guys would say that.

2127
01:49:58.02 --> 01:49:59.02
Get caught up.

2128
01:49:59.02 --> 01:50:03.02
And that's just man, especially when you're in a leadership position.

2129
01:50:03.02 --> 01:50:04.02
You need a sling.

2130
01:50:04.02 --> 01:50:05.02
Because you got to look at your map.

2131
01:50:05.02 --> 01:50:06.02
You got to pull out.

2132
01:50:06.02 --> 01:50:07.02
You know.

2133
01:50:07.02 --> 01:50:08.02
Yeah.

2134
01:50:08.02 --> 01:50:09.02
You got to do stuff.

2135
01:50:09.02 --> 01:50:11.02
You don't have a sling and you get blown up.

2136
01:50:11.02 --> 01:50:12.02
Yeah.

2137
01:50:12.02 --> 01:50:13.02
Where's your weapon?

2138
01:50:13.02 --> 01:50:15.02
You have no idea when you wake up.

2139
01:50:15.02 --> 01:50:16.02
No.

2140
01:50:16.02 --> 01:50:17.02
Yeah.

2141
01:50:17.02 --> 01:50:21.02
But then there's some, you know, some people just they wouldn't carry a sling.

2142
01:50:21.02 --> 01:50:23.02
Mark leaves one of my shing on her sheep.

2143
01:50:23.02 --> 01:50:24.02
Just no sling.

2144
01:50:24.02 --> 01:50:25.02
No.

2145
01:50:25.02 --> 01:50:26.02
That was like a man thing to do was no sling.

2146
01:50:26.02 --> 01:50:27.02
Yeah.

2147
01:50:27.02 --> 01:50:28.02
On her 1060.

2148
01:50:28.02 --> 01:50:30.02
Or these days of Mark 48.

2149
01:50:30.02 --> 01:50:31.02
Really?

2150
01:50:31.02 --> 01:50:32.02
Yeah.

2151
01:50:32.02 --> 01:50:33.02
How strong is this guy?

2152
01:50:33.02 --> 01:50:34.02
Strong.

2153
01:50:34.02 --> 01:50:35.02
Yeah.

2154
01:50:35.02 --> 01:50:36.02
Strong.

2155
01:50:36.02 --> 01:50:37.02
M-79.

2156
01:50:37.02 --> 01:50:38.02
You carried.

2157
01:50:38.02 --> 01:50:39.02
Sawdolph.

2158
01:50:39.02 --> 01:50:40.02
Oh, yes.

2159
01:50:40.02 --> 01:50:44.02
I cannot believe that me and my guy is the not-thinker sawdolph for him.

2160
01:50:44.02 --> 01:50:45.02
Yeah.

2161
01:50:45.02 --> 01:50:46.02
It's like guaranteed guys with the sawdolph.

2162
01:50:46.02 --> 01:50:47.02
Yeah.

2163
01:50:47.02 --> 01:50:50.02
My first self-inflicted room was from a sawdolph M79.

2164
01:50:50.02 --> 01:50:51.02
What'd you do?

2165
01:50:51.02 --> 01:50:53.02
Well, we're in a process.

2166
01:50:53.02 --> 01:50:54.02
We're cutting them down.

2167
01:50:54.02 --> 01:50:55.02
Uh-huh.

2168
01:50:55.02 --> 01:50:57.02
So the question was how far he cut the barrel down.

2169
01:50:57.02 --> 01:51:00.02
So we finally cut it right down to the last hinge.

2170
01:51:00.02 --> 01:51:01.02
Mm-hmm.

2171
01:51:01.02 --> 01:51:02.02
We're.

2172
01:51:02.02 --> 01:51:03.02
It's the last one.

2173
01:51:03.02 --> 01:51:04.02
That's, yeah.

2174
01:51:04.02 --> 01:51:06.02
That's to the bottom of the frame.

2175
01:51:06.02 --> 01:51:07.02
Got it.

2176
01:51:07.02 --> 01:51:08.02
Yeah.

2177
01:51:08.02 --> 01:51:10.02
So we, we kept bringing it back.

2178
01:51:10.02 --> 01:51:11.02
So we're down to range.

2179
01:51:11.02 --> 01:51:12.02
We're there.

2180
01:51:12.02 --> 01:51:15.02
And the question was because you cut the barrel off.

2181
01:51:15.02 --> 01:51:17.02
It needs the number of rotations.

2182
01:51:17.02 --> 01:51:18.02
Yeah.

2183
01:51:18.02 --> 01:51:20.02
Now our, our weapons guys knew that.

2184
01:51:20.02 --> 01:51:22.02
But I was mean, Rick Howard, we're common guys.

2185
01:51:22.02 --> 01:51:23.02
And I didn't really ask.

2186
01:51:23.02 --> 01:51:25.02
It's just the question was fire and sea.

2187
01:51:25.02 --> 01:51:29.02
So on this day, I fired, fairly close.

2188
01:51:29.02 --> 01:51:32.02
It goes being, you know,

2189
01:51:32.02 --> 01:51:34.02
I know he's inside of the night makes.

2190
01:51:34.02 --> 01:51:35.02
And then it went all like pop,

2191
01:51:35.02 --> 01:51:37.02
being like that.

2192
01:51:37.02 --> 01:51:39.02
And I go, oh, damn.

2193
01:51:39.02 --> 01:51:40.02
So I go to Rick Howard.

2194
01:51:40.02 --> 01:51:42.02
I think a bead just hit me.

2195
01:51:42.02 --> 01:51:43.02
Pull my strip.

2196
01:51:43.02 --> 01:51:44.02
He dumbass.

2197
01:51:44.02 --> 01:51:45.02
He just shot yourself.

2198
01:51:45.02 --> 01:51:47.02
My first self inflicted moon.

2199
01:51:47.02 --> 01:51:49.02
But the good news was that I'm sitting on work.

2200
01:51:49.02 --> 01:51:52.02
And they caused you to cut the handle down to just have enough

2201
01:51:52.02 --> 01:51:54.02
to you could hold on to.

2202
01:51:54.02 --> 01:51:56.02
Because that way is less less weapon.

2203
01:51:56.02 --> 01:51:57.02
Yeah.

2204
01:51:57.02 --> 01:51:58.02
He's to how long the firepower.

2205
01:51:58.02 --> 01:51:59.02
Oh, yeah.

2206
01:51:59.02 --> 01:52:01.02
I caught that weapon down by half.

2207
01:52:01.02 --> 01:52:02.02
Oh, yeah.

2208
01:52:02.02 --> 01:52:03.02
I was looking at the pictures you have.

2209
01:52:03.02 --> 01:52:05.02
It's, that thing is tiny.

2210
01:52:05.02 --> 01:52:07.02
Tiny but effective.

2211
01:52:07.02 --> 01:52:09.02
Charlie hated those things.

2212
01:52:09.02 --> 01:52:12.02
And at one point you had a, you had a holster for that thing.

2213
01:52:12.02 --> 01:52:13.02
Yeah.

2214
01:52:13.02 --> 01:52:14.02
That's John Wayne.

2215
01:52:14.02 --> 01:52:16.02
That's the, that's the one layoffs with my,

2216
01:52:16.02 --> 01:52:17.02
a dog knife.

2217
01:52:17.02 --> 01:52:20.02
And I had somebody had crafted it.

2218
01:52:20.02 --> 01:52:21.02
And I put it on.

2219
01:52:21.02 --> 01:52:23.02
Yeah, that was perfect.

2220
01:52:23.02 --> 01:52:24.02
Yeah.

2221
01:52:24.02 --> 01:52:25.02
But never had a double.

2222
01:52:25.02 --> 01:52:27.02
For that point, I just like everybody else.

2223
01:52:27.02 --> 01:52:30.02
We just carried it on the deering.

2224
01:52:30.02 --> 01:52:32.02
We taped it so it would be quiet though.

2225
01:52:32.02 --> 01:52:36.02
You carried 34 20 round mags.

2226
01:52:36.02 --> 01:52:38.02
Each pat, each with 18 rounds each.

2227
01:52:38.02 --> 01:52:41.02
So that's 612 rounds for good luck.

2228
01:52:41.02 --> 01:52:42.02
Yeah.

2229
01:52:42.02 --> 01:52:47.02
That's not the only character or like a pouts with a couple extra clips.

2230
01:52:47.02 --> 01:52:50.02
And in case we needed to reload the 34 magazines.

2231
01:52:50.02 --> 01:52:52.02
And you went on.

2232
01:52:52.02 --> 01:52:56.02
You mentioned you had few missions where you were down to your last one or two.

2233
01:52:56.02 --> 01:52:59.02
At least twice that I remember echo four was the first time.

2234
01:52:59.02 --> 01:53:04.02
Did you always hang onto your magazines when you were out?

2235
01:53:04.02 --> 01:53:08.02
At dependent on the degree of intensity of the firefight.

2236
01:53:08.02 --> 01:53:11.02
If I had time, we keep us for a happy.

2237
01:53:11.02 --> 01:53:13.02
I'll bring back my damn magazines.

2238
01:53:13.02 --> 01:53:14.02
Did you stuff from your shirt?

2239
01:53:14.02 --> 01:53:15.02
Yeah.

2240
01:53:15.02 --> 01:53:16.02
Yeah.

2241
01:53:16.02 --> 01:53:18.02
Because the web gear would be tight.

2242
01:53:18.02 --> 01:53:22.02
So our jungle fatigue were out.

2243
01:53:22.02 --> 01:53:23.02
Yeah.

2244
01:53:23.02 --> 01:53:27.02
So you had the pants, but then the harness from the web gear.

2245
01:53:27.02 --> 01:53:28.02
Yeah.

2246
01:53:28.02 --> 01:53:29.02
And the web gear would be the only thing in.

2247
01:53:29.02 --> 01:53:32.02
When I came in, we'd stuff mags in our shirt.

2248
01:53:32.02 --> 01:53:35.02
And then, but with body armor, you can't do that.

2249
01:53:35.02 --> 01:53:39.02
So now that's carry like pouches or just dropping their leg cargo pockets or whatever.

2250
01:53:39.02 --> 01:53:40.02
Yeah.

2251
01:53:40.02 --> 01:53:44.02
Our preferred thing would be AR belts because you could put four magazines in and one

2252
01:53:44.02 --> 01:53:45.02
across the top.

2253
01:53:45.02 --> 01:53:46.02
And it was a nice pouch.

2254
01:53:46.02 --> 01:53:49.02
The AR belts that they have from World War II.

2255
01:53:49.02 --> 01:53:53.02
Perfect for the 20 round magazines.

2256
01:53:53.02 --> 01:53:56.02
That's a lot of, just, you know, we would normally carry.

2257
01:53:56.02 --> 01:54:00.02
Seven to ten, 30 round mags.

2258
01:54:00.02 --> 01:54:06.02
So we carry like, I mean, sometimes I guess more than that, but not no 600 rounds.

2259
01:54:06.02 --> 01:54:08.02
But you weren't just being alone for a while.

2260
01:54:08.02 --> 01:54:11.02
No, we weren't fighting divisions worth the people either.

2261
01:54:11.02 --> 01:54:14.02
So I mean, yeah.

2262
01:54:14.02 --> 01:54:18.02
You know, and I guess we did what we did have is we always had heavy machine guns.

2263
01:54:18.02 --> 01:54:20.02
You know, so that makes a big difference too.

2264
01:54:20.02 --> 01:54:25.02
I guess, you know, we would have Mark 48, which is 762 and then the Mark 46, which is

2265
01:54:25.02 --> 01:54:31.02
556, you know, that's basically like a little stoner and a and a and 60.

2266
01:54:31.02 --> 01:54:33.02
The modern versions of those two things.

2267
01:54:33.02 --> 01:54:35.02
But yeah, you know, so we had a sol 2, right?

2268
01:54:35.02 --> 01:54:38.02
Yeah, well, that's the Mark 46 is a saw.

2269
01:54:38.02 --> 01:54:39.02
Yeah.

2270
01:54:39.02 --> 01:54:39.02
Okay.

2271
01:54:39.02 --> 01:54:40.02
Yeah.

2272
01:54:40.02 --> 01:54:41.02
Yes.

2273
01:54:41.02 --> 01:54:46.02
So we had those and those guys would carry a lot of rounds, a lot of rounds, like 800

2274
01:54:46.02 --> 01:54:48.02
2000, sometimes more on the outside.

2275
01:54:48.02 --> 01:54:51.02
Yeah, what's tough on the character like that over a thousand.

2276
01:54:51.02 --> 01:54:52.02
Yeah.

2277
01:54:52.02 --> 01:54:56.02
And I had guys go winchester, go run out of bullets.

2278
01:54:56.02 --> 01:54:57.02
Really?

2279
01:54:57.02 --> 01:54:57.02
Yeah.

2280
01:54:57.02 --> 01:54:58.02
With that many.

2281
01:54:58.02 --> 01:55:02.02
So yeah, I guess maybe that was the the differentiator.

2282
01:55:02.02 --> 01:55:07.02
You carry 10 to 12 fragments.

2283
01:55:07.02 --> 01:55:09.02
That's a lot of fragments.

2284
01:55:09.02 --> 01:55:12.02
I guess when you're going taking fights with divisions, you got to carry a lot of

2285
01:55:12.02 --> 01:55:13.02
Frag grenades.

2286
01:55:13.02 --> 01:55:14.02
Oh, yeah.

2287
01:55:14.02 --> 01:55:16.02
And it always kept the last one.

2288
01:55:16.02 --> 01:55:18.02
That was one up here.

2289
01:55:18.02 --> 01:55:19.02
Just in case.

2290
01:55:19.02 --> 01:55:20.02
I must be a POW.

2291
01:55:20.02 --> 01:55:22.02
Oh, yeah.

2292
01:55:22.02 --> 01:55:24.02
Absolutely.

2293
01:55:24.02 --> 01:55:27.02
We would carry, I don't know.

2294
01:55:27.02 --> 01:55:30.02
Well, I would carry like one or two.

2295
01:55:30.02 --> 01:55:31.02
Well, how often would you be?

2296
01:55:31.02 --> 01:55:32.02
I just got left at that.

2297
01:55:32.02 --> 01:55:33.02
It's official.

2298
01:55:33.02 --> 01:55:34.02
Sure.

2299
01:55:34.02 --> 01:55:35.02
I don't laugh that.

2300
01:55:35.02 --> 01:55:38.02
How often would you, how often would you be more than two of them?

2301
01:55:38.02 --> 01:55:39.02
Hopefully never.

2302
01:55:39.02 --> 01:55:40.02
Yeah.

2303
01:55:40.02 --> 01:55:42.02
You know, and especially I'm going to leadership position.

2304
01:55:42.02 --> 01:55:45.02
I'm hopefully not the hucking grenades.

2305
01:55:45.02 --> 01:55:47.02
But, uh, yeah.

2306
01:55:47.02 --> 01:55:51.02
Yeah.

2307
01:55:51.02 --> 01:55:53.02
No, you know, the big difference, especially in Romadi.

2308
01:55:53.02 --> 01:55:56.02
I mean, in Romadi, I remember explaining to the guys that relieved us.

2309
01:55:56.02 --> 01:55:59.02
You know, we had a big overhead imagery.

2310
01:55:59.02 --> 01:56:00.02
Yeah.

2311
01:56:00.02 --> 01:56:01.02
And I put my hand on the map.

2312
01:56:01.02 --> 01:56:04.02
And I said, no matter where you put your hand on this map, you'll be touching

2313
01:56:04.02 --> 01:56:06.02
up front of the unit.

2314
01:56:06.02 --> 01:56:09.02
So like, and you know, this is, you know, probably within three to 500 meters of view.

2315
01:56:09.02 --> 01:56:12.02
Anywhere you were in Romadi, yours are from the unit.

2316
01:56:12.02 --> 01:56:13.02
Really.

2317
01:56:13.02 --> 01:56:15.02
So that's why, you know, you were going to get reinforcements.

2318
01:56:15.02 --> 01:56:16.02
You were going to get tanks.

2319
01:56:16.02 --> 01:56:18.02
Yeah, but in between that time, you earned your pay.

2320
01:56:18.02 --> 01:56:19.02
Yeah.

2321
01:56:19.02 --> 01:56:20.02
After earn your pay.

2322
01:56:20.02 --> 01:56:22.02
Yeah.

2323
01:56:22.02 --> 01:56:23.02
Yeah.

2324
01:56:23.02 --> 01:56:24.02
I was talking to late, late, late, late.

2325
01:56:24.02 --> 01:56:25.02
Well, late, that's another thing.

2326
01:56:25.02 --> 01:56:26.02
So it's late.

2327
01:56:26.02 --> 01:56:28.02
Late, it's got a chapter in dichotomy and leadership.

2328
01:56:28.02 --> 01:56:33.02
Where he's talking about preparing, over preparing for too many contingencies.

2329
01:56:33.02 --> 01:56:38.02
He talks about, it was his first patrol out on, out going out with a Marine Corps

2330
01:56:38.02 --> 01:56:39.02
in a daytime patrol.

2331
01:56:39.02 --> 01:56:41.02
And he's talking about how much stuff he cared,

2332
01:56:41.02 --> 01:56:45.02
all this stuff for one of the thing he cared is, you know, eight grenades or something like that.

2333
01:56:45.02 --> 01:56:52.02
And, you know, he reflects on how that was just way too many of us like, hey man,

2334
01:56:52.02 --> 01:56:55.02
you know, tilt, go out and the field will less than 10.

2335
01:56:55.02 --> 01:57:00.02
So the different AO, different AO, different AO.

2336
01:57:00.02 --> 01:57:02.02
We probably would have adjusted our grenades.

2337
01:57:02.02 --> 01:57:05.02
I wonder how much you would have changed if you had to wear body armor.

2338
01:57:05.02 --> 01:57:08.02
Or if you would have decided not to or whatever.

2339
01:57:08.02 --> 01:57:09.02
You know, it's interesting.

2340
01:57:09.02 --> 01:57:10.02
That's an interesting development.

2341
01:57:10.02 --> 01:57:13.02
I'll tell you, if we even had today's stadium art,

2342
01:57:13.02 --> 01:57:15.02
a never would have worn it.

2343
01:57:15.02 --> 01:57:16.02
It's just too much weight.

2344
01:57:16.02 --> 01:57:19.02
And you had to be able to move, I mean, you know,

2345
01:57:19.02 --> 01:57:22.02
you have to mention, you're so damn lucky, you know, bullets are gonna hit you.

2346
01:57:22.02 --> 01:57:23.02
Yeah.

2347
01:57:23.02 --> 01:57:28.02
That's why I crawled a lot, try to keep the low profile.

2348
01:57:28.02 --> 01:57:34.02
But now I probably would have declined it because of the weight as it was.

2349
01:57:34.02 --> 01:57:39.02
In our AO, maybe another AO with different situations,

2350
01:57:39.02 --> 01:57:42.02
more flexibility with assets.

2351
01:57:42.02 --> 01:57:47.02
And the thing that's interesting is, one of the reasons why you wear a helmet now

2352
01:57:47.02 --> 01:57:50.02
isn't just to protect your head, it's because that's where your nads mount onto.

2353
01:57:50.02 --> 01:57:51.02
Your night vision.

2354
01:57:51.02 --> 01:57:52.02
Oh, yeah.

2355
01:57:52.02 --> 01:57:53.02
Your night vision mount onto your.

2356
01:57:53.02 --> 01:57:57.02
So you, they do have a contraption that's like a headband looking thing.

2357
01:57:57.02 --> 01:57:58.02
I don't think they make it anymore.

2358
01:57:58.02 --> 01:58:02.02
But, but where you could wear that, but, you know, your nads mount on your.

2359
01:58:02.02 --> 01:58:04.02
Your night vision mounts on your helmet.

2360
01:58:04.02 --> 01:58:05.02
That's just the way it is.

2361
01:58:05.02 --> 01:58:06.02
I've seen no silo.

2362
01:58:06.02 --> 01:58:07.02
Yeah, that's what it got.

2363
01:58:07.02 --> 01:58:08.02
It's a cool.

2364
01:58:08.02 --> 01:58:09.02
I want one.

2365
01:58:09.02 --> 01:58:10.02
Yeah.

2366
01:58:10.02 --> 01:58:12.02
That's good time when those dots flip down.

2367
01:58:12.02 --> 01:58:13.02
All right.

2368
01:58:13.02 --> 01:58:16.02
But instead of wearing a helmet, you wore a crevat.

2369
01:58:16.02 --> 01:58:20.02
The green crevat on your head, one around your neck.

2370
01:58:20.02 --> 01:58:23.02
You had you wore regular army for teagues.

2371
01:58:23.02 --> 01:58:29.02
Yeah, there is sterile for teagues that had two pucks at the top of the angle.

2372
01:58:29.02 --> 01:58:32.02
And two pockets down here to hang out.

2373
01:58:32.02 --> 01:58:34.02
And then we customized them.

2374
01:58:34.02 --> 01:58:38.02
And we had the the tailor put in pockets here.

2375
01:58:38.02 --> 01:58:41.02
And so for mirrors, maps, morphine, serbets,

2376
01:58:41.02 --> 01:58:43.02
it's all close right here.

2377
01:58:43.02 --> 01:58:46.02
And then we had a pockets on each arm.

2378
01:58:46.02 --> 01:58:49.02
To put other things up there were pinflares.

2379
01:58:49.02 --> 01:58:51.02
Other things are good.

2380
01:58:51.02 --> 01:58:53.02
And that's something that we did too.

2381
01:58:53.02 --> 01:58:56.02
So we did even before even in the 90s before the everyone.

2382
01:58:56.02 --> 01:59:00.02
Because now the fatigue's come issued with pockets on the arms.

2383
01:59:00.02 --> 01:59:03.02
I think, but we used to take them off and so on.

2384
01:59:03.02 --> 01:59:07.02
And that's where you keep your your pants and your notebooks and your pen flares.

2385
01:59:07.02 --> 01:59:09.02
And you're, and you're signal mirror.

2386
01:59:09.02 --> 01:59:10.02
Yeah.

2387
01:59:10.02 --> 01:59:12.02
And then on the ones on your chest, you had maps and morphine,

2388
01:59:12.02 --> 01:59:13.02
you had extra notebook.

2389
01:59:13.02 --> 01:59:16.02
Your URC 10 emergency radio.

2390
01:59:16.02 --> 01:59:20.02
And then you had a, you wore a watch of sake.

2391
01:59:20.02 --> 01:59:21.02
Yeah.

2392
01:59:21.02 --> 01:59:23.02
Illuminus watch.

2393
01:59:23.02 --> 01:59:25.02
You wore gloves.

2394
01:59:25.02 --> 01:59:26.02
Always.

2395
01:59:26.02 --> 01:59:29.02
Just cut out the thumb index finger,

2396
01:59:29.02 --> 01:59:32.02
then the middle finger just cut it to the tip.

2397
01:59:32.02 --> 01:59:35.02
So you grabbed tape on the magazine sort of firefights.

2398
01:59:35.02 --> 01:59:36.02
Same thing, same thing we would do.

2399
01:59:36.02 --> 01:59:39.02
But you always work gloves otherwise your hands are just getting destroyed.

2400
01:59:39.02 --> 01:59:40.02
Oh, the jungle.

2401
01:59:40.02 --> 01:59:41.02
Forget about it.

2402
01:59:41.02 --> 01:59:41.02
Yeah.

2403
01:59:41.02 --> 01:59:45.02
Because a lot of times we wind up, you have to get a new pair of gloves.

2404
01:59:45.02 --> 01:59:49.02
We just get torn up so much on the genre and fatigues.

2405
01:59:49.02 --> 01:59:53.02
Man, it was a weight of weight of an event and a thorns.

2406
01:59:53.02 --> 01:59:55.02
Because you know, they're a weight of a minute.

2407
01:59:55.02 --> 01:59:57.02
You get caught into it.

2408
01:59:57.02 --> 01:59:58.02
You walk into it.

2409
01:59:58.02 --> 02:00:01.02
Your leg goes into the pins that's coming together.

2410
02:00:01.02 --> 02:00:04.02
So you had to stop and then get the pin to get your leg.

2411
02:00:04.02 --> 02:00:05.02
Otherwise it goes to the pin.

2412
02:00:05.02 --> 02:00:08.02
Otherwise it goes deeper into your leg.

2413
02:00:08.02 --> 02:00:11.02
What about did you carry any kind of mosquito net for your head?

2414
02:00:11.02 --> 02:00:12.02
No.

2415
02:00:12.02 --> 02:00:13.02
How come?

2416
02:00:13.02 --> 02:00:15.02
Never thought about it.

2417
02:00:15.02 --> 02:00:16.02
Mosquito net for the head.

2418
02:00:16.02 --> 02:00:17.02
Yeah.

2419
02:00:17.02 --> 02:00:20.02
Well, I used to, this was like the most brilliant thing.

2420
02:00:20.02 --> 02:00:21.02
I think it was an Australian guy.

2421
02:00:21.02 --> 02:00:22.02
So I told me this.

2422
02:00:22.02 --> 02:00:25.02
You, I would have like a little square of mosquito netting.

2423
02:00:25.02 --> 02:00:26.02
Hmm.

2424
02:00:26.02 --> 02:00:29.02
And when we would stop patrolling,

2425
02:00:29.02 --> 02:00:32.02
I would take out that little square, put it over my head.

2426
02:00:32.02 --> 02:00:34.02
Right over my right over my floppy hat.

2427
02:00:34.02 --> 02:00:38.02
And talk it in and all of a sudden you knocking chewed apart by mosquitoes.

2428
02:00:38.02 --> 02:00:42.02
Oh yeah, one night, one time we did a practice mission.

2429
02:00:42.02 --> 02:00:43.02
East of the actual.

2430
02:00:43.02 --> 02:00:46.02
And the morning I couldn't, I couldn't open my eyes.

2431
02:00:46.02 --> 02:00:48.02
I had been bitten so much by mosquitoes.

2432
02:00:48.02 --> 02:00:50.02
My face was puffed out.

2433
02:00:50.02 --> 02:00:51.02
You need that mosquito net.

2434
02:00:51.02 --> 02:00:52.02
I needed to help.

2435
02:00:52.02 --> 02:00:54.02
Had I only known.

2436
02:00:54.02 --> 02:00:55.02
I just got a fall of that.

2437
02:00:55.02 --> 02:00:57.02
I just got a thought about that one.

2438
02:00:57.02 --> 02:00:59.02
I had a guy we were doing some training.

2439
02:00:59.02 --> 02:01:03.02
And none of us had mosquito netting except for the officer.

2440
02:01:03.02 --> 02:01:05.02
And so the officer was sleeping hardly.

2441
02:01:05.02 --> 02:01:06.02
Like just fully.

2442
02:01:06.02 --> 02:01:11.02
And one of the other young listed guys was catching mosquitoes.

2443
02:01:11.02 --> 02:01:15.02
And putting them inside this guy's body was asleep.

2444
02:01:15.02 --> 02:01:18.02
He woke up coming.

2445
02:01:18.02 --> 02:01:21.02
But not like those mosquitoes were trapped in there with them.

2446
02:01:21.02 --> 02:01:22.02
They were trapped in there.

2447
02:01:22.02 --> 02:01:23.02
And they couldn't get out.

2448
02:01:23.02 --> 02:01:24.02
They were just having a feast.

2449
02:01:24.02 --> 02:01:25.02
Trapped hungry mosquitoes.

2450
02:01:25.02 --> 02:01:26.02
Trapped hungry mosquitoes.

2451
02:01:26.02 --> 02:01:27.02
Yeah.

2452
02:01:27.02 --> 02:01:28.02
Yeah.

2453
02:01:28.02 --> 02:01:29.02
So, but note not for you.

2454
02:01:29.02 --> 02:01:30.02
No mosquito net.

2455
02:01:30.02 --> 02:01:31.02
No.

2456
02:01:31.02 --> 02:01:34.02
I hadn't thought about that one.

2457
02:01:34.02 --> 02:01:35.02
Leachers.

2458
02:01:35.02 --> 02:01:36.02
Oh.

2459
02:01:36.02 --> 02:01:39.02
You guys ran into a lot of leaches.

2460
02:01:39.02 --> 02:01:40.02
Always.

2461
02:01:40.02 --> 02:01:43.02
Yeah, we had a bug repellent for that.

2462
02:01:43.02 --> 02:01:46.02
It's even really the bug repellent on them once you got sucked on by a leach.

2463
02:01:46.02 --> 02:01:47.02
Yeah.

2464
02:01:47.02 --> 02:01:48.02
They would instantly fall off.

2465
02:01:48.02 --> 02:01:49.02
But you always try to wait.

2466
02:01:49.02 --> 02:01:55.02
Try to just see if you could jiggle them off because you knew the bug repellent could be smelt.

2467
02:01:55.02 --> 02:01:56.02
Hmm.

2468
02:01:56.02 --> 02:01:57.02
By the bad guys.

2469
02:01:57.02 --> 02:01:58.02
So.

2470
02:01:58.02 --> 02:01:59.02
Hmm.

2471
02:01:59.02 --> 02:02:04.02
Then you had your on your web gear, which was the old World War II web gear.

2472
02:02:04.02 --> 02:02:05.02
You had on your left harness.

2473
02:02:05.02 --> 02:02:06.02
You had your K bar.

2474
02:02:06.02 --> 02:02:07.02
Handled down.

2475
02:02:07.02 --> 02:02:08.02
Or a sock knife.

2476
02:02:08.02 --> 02:02:10.02
Or a sock knife until you lost it.

2477
02:02:10.02 --> 02:02:11.02
Tue love.

2478
02:02:11.02 --> 02:02:14.02
That's what we need to do.

2479
02:02:14.02 --> 02:02:17.02
A recovery mission for get the sock knife back.

2480
02:02:17.02 --> 02:02:18.02
Yes.

2481
02:02:18.02 --> 02:02:21.02
Handled down.

2482
02:02:21.02 --> 02:02:22.02
Sure.

2483
02:02:22.02 --> 02:02:23.02
That's how you rolled.

2484
02:02:23.02 --> 02:02:25.02
Yeah, because this way you pulled out your ready.

2485
02:02:25.02 --> 02:02:26.02
Hmm.

2486
02:02:26.02 --> 02:02:29.02
It's a period to pull out the jungle. You might cut up in the vines.

2487
02:02:29.02 --> 02:02:32.02
Got it. Got it.

2488
02:02:32.02 --> 02:02:36.02
You had hand grenades there because you were basically covered in hand grenades.

2489
02:02:36.02 --> 02:02:38.02
Oh yeah.

2490
02:02:38.02 --> 02:02:39.02
Smoke.

2491
02:02:39.02 --> 02:02:43.02
You had there. You had some some, you know, bandages there.

2492
02:02:43.02 --> 02:02:45.02
On your right harness. You had your strobe light.

2493
02:02:45.02 --> 02:02:47.02
You had more hand grenades.

2494
02:02:47.02 --> 02:02:49.02
You had your D-ring.

2495
02:02:49.02 --> 02:02:52.02
And you had more smoke grenades.

2496
02:02:52.02 --> 02:02:54.02
Then on your belt.

2497
02:02:54.02 --> 02:02:57.02
You had one canteen usually.

2498
02:02:57.02 --> 02:03:01.02
It depends on the target. Sometimes it'd be maybe two.

2499
02:03:01.02 --> 02:03:05.02
But usually one and then one I had a second one in my backpack.

2500
02:03:05.02 --> 02:03:06.02
Rocksack.

2501
02:03:06.02 --> 02:03:08.02
You normally wouldn't get, would you get thirsty?

2502
02:03:08.02 --> 02:03:10.02
Was there normally enough water?

2503
02:03:10.02 --> 02:03:13.02
Uh, and the jungle wasn't as bad as Cambodia.

2504
02:03:13.02 --> 02:03:17.02
So, but yeah, you get thirsty because you're hopping up and down.

2505
02:03:17.02 --> 02:03:20.02
Um, there's a couple times we particularly in that day.

2506
02:03:20.02 --> 02:03:22.02
We went straight up with the orchards.

2507
02:03:22.02 --> 02:03:25.02
That was a day we got, we were all out of water.

2508
02:03:25.02 --> 02:03:27.02
Not fun.

2509
02:03:27.02 --> 02:03:28.02
No.

2510
02:03:28.02 --> 02:03:30.02
So you had one canteen. You had a Willie Pete grenade.

2511
02:03:30.02 --> 02:03:32.02
We had your survival axe.

2512
02:03:32.02 --> 02:03:36.02
Which was the Frankenwarren survival axe type two.

2513
02:03:36.02 --> 02:03:37.02
Indeed.

2514
02:03:37.02 --> 02:03:38.02
That's what I wanted.

2515
02:03:38.02 --> 02:03:40.02
I wanted to type two.

2516
02:03:40.02 --> 02:03:44.02
I looked him up and had like a hook at the top.

2517
02:03:44.02 --> 02:03:45.02
Yeah.

2518
02:03:45.02 --> 02:03:46.02
Another play you went through.

2519
02:03:46.02 --> 02:03:48.02
When you came back on the, on the back pool,

2520
02:03:48.02 --> 02:03:53.02
you could try to make it effective to cut a, particularly cutting vines.

2521
02:03:53.02 --> 02:03:55.02
That thing came with you all the time.

2522
02:03:55.02 --> 02:03:57.02
Every mission.

2523
02:03:57.02 --> 02:03:59.02
I got a home under my desk right now.

2524
02:03:59.02 --> 02:04:01.02
In case any true comes in, I'm ready.

2525
02:04:01.02 --> 02:04:02.02
I like it.

2526
02:04:02.02 --> 02:04:04.02
Ha ha ha ha.

2527
02:04:04.02 --> 02:04:06.02
So if you're in true there's feeling lucky.

2528
02:04:06.02 --> 02:04:07.02
Yeah, luck.

2529
02:04:07.02 --> 02:04:09.02
Meet Mr. Till.

2530
02:04:09.02 --> 02:04:11.02
I compass around your neck.

2531
02:04:11.02 --> 02:04:14.02
You used to carve out for your belt.

2532
02:04:14.02 --> 02:04:15.02
Yes.

2533
02:04:15.02 --> 02:04:17.02
So the belt I was talking about before is that we're built of your web gear.

2534
02:04:17.02 --> 02:04:20.02
But just the part of your pants was just a, was a cravat.

2535
02:04:20.02 --> 02:04:22.02
You cared to swiss army knife.

2536
02:04:22.02 --> 02:04:24.02
You cared a gas mask.

2537
02:04:24.02 --> 02:04:25.02
Always.

2538
02:04:25.02 --> 02:04:27.02
You always cared a gas mask.

2539
02:04:27.02 --> 02:04:32.02
How we had teams that got hit and the A camps that have been hit by the enemy used to.

2540
02:04:32.02 --> 02:04:33.02
Yes.

2541
02:04:33.02 --> 02:04:34.02
Sure.

2542
02:04:34.02 --> 02:04:35.02
And they used.

2543
02:04:35.02 --> 02:04:42.02
I forget what the, the instance were, but there were a couple times that the enemy had used gas on our people in

2544
02:04:42.02 --> 02:04:47.02
the US as well as with the CIA operation. We weren't told that.

2545
02:04:47.02 --> 02:04:51.02
But we had cold evidence that they had done it.

2546
02:04:51.02 --> 02:04:53.02
And that they could hit one of our recontinues.

2547
02:04:53.02 --> 02:04:56.02
So we had to carry that bulky, yes thing at all times.

2548
02:04:56.02 --> 02:05:01.02
I was going to say, but and this is this was the, the, the concern was tear gas.

2549
02:05:01.02 --> 02:05:04.02
Well tear gas or who else knows what they had.

2550
02:05:04.02 --> 02:05:05.02
I mean, these are common.

2551
02:05:05.02 --> 02:05:07.02
It's done to play by rules of engagement.

2552
02:05:07.02 --> 02:05:09.02
I mean, they're not in the lails.

2553
02:05:09.02 --> 02:05:10.02
Because yeah, that's your opinion.

2554
02:05:10.02 --> 02:05:12.02
I was thinking with all this crap that you're carrying.

2555
02:05:12.02 --> 02:05:15.02
And a gas mask or just huge and bulky.

2556
02:05:15.02 --> 02:05:17.02
Yeah, left hip.

2557
02:05:17.02 --> 02:05:18.02
I don't know if that all the time.

2558
02:05:18.02 --> 02:05:19.02
Had to.

2559
02:05:19.02 --> 02:05:21.02
And we used them twice.

2560
02:05:21.02 --> 02:05:25.02
And we, in fact, we had designed a mission.

2561
02:05:25.02 --> 02:05:28.02
One of our missions was to.

2562
02:05:28.02 --> 02:05:32.02
When we got a stractive from a target an M.A. target,

2563
02:05:32.02 --> 02:05:35.02
we saw a road to had.

2564
02:05:35.02 --> 02:05:39.02
A little guard station, a guard station.

2565
02:05:39.02 --> 02:05:42.02
But it was north of the DMC river.

2566
02:05:42.02 --> 02:05:45.02
So the quest for getting.

2567
02:05:45.02 --> 02:05:47.02
A live POW.

2568
02:05:47.02 --> 02:05:52.02
We found out that we had one of our guys that did a VR and flew a couple of rules.

2569
02:05:52.02 --> 02:05:54.02
And they saw these little waste stations along the way.

2570
02:05:54.02 --> 02:05:57.02
So our thought was, we'll get gas.

2571
02:05:57.02 --> 02:05:58.02
Gas.

2572
02:05:58.02 --> 02:06:01.02
And they said they had a knockout gas at the time, right?

2573
02:06:01.02 --> 02:06:05.02
So we practiced for a couple of days with tear gas.

2574
02:06:05.02 --> 02:06:08.02
And we had to get the helicopter piles and the gun crews.

2575
02:06:08.02 --> 02:06:11.02
Everybody would their masks and then have masks that they could talk to each other.

2576
02:06:11.02 --> 02:06:13.02
And then talk to us.

2577
02:06:13.02 --> 02:06:18.02
And so we practiced for several days training with the helicopters coming in.

2578
02:06:18.02 --> 02:06:21.02
And the mission plan was go up.

2579
02:06:21.02 --> 02:06:23.02
In the middle of the day.

2580
02:06:23.02 --> 02:06:24.02
Go to one of those camps.

2581
02:06:24.02 --> 02:06:25.02
Hit it.

2582
02:06:25.02 --> 02:06:26.02
Gas it.

2583
02:06:26.02 --> 02:06:27.02
Go in and scarf.

2584
02:06:27.02 --> 02:06:28.02
And go home.

2585
02:06:28.02 --> 02:06:29.02
Get a five day pass.

2586
02:06:29.02 --> 02:06:30.02
100 bucks.

2587
02:06:30.02 --> 02:06:31.02
Yeah.

2588
02:06:31.02 --> 02:06:34.02
But they had a special knockout gas that was supposed to use.

2589
02:06:34.02 --> 02:06:36.02
And at the end they wouldn't let us.

2590
02:06:36.02 --> 02:06:38.02
They wouldn't give us the gas.

2591
02:06:38.02 --> 02:06:39.02
I don't know if they had it.

2592
02:06:39.02 --> 02:06:42.02
But they wouldn't give us the knockout gas.

2593
02:06:42.02 --> 02:06:44.02
So another mission came up.

2594
02:06:44.02 --> 02:06:48.02
We had a bright light around and we never got back to the concept of doing it.

2595
02:06:48.02 --> 02:06:49.02
And you carried.

2596
02:06:49.02 --> 02:06:52.02
You usually carried one grenade for your 40 mic mic.

2597
02:06:52.02 --> 02:06:53.02
That was tear gas.

2598
02:06:53.02 --> 02:06:54.02
Always.

2599
02:06:54.02 --> 02:06:55.02
Sure.

2600
02:06:55.02 --> 02:06:56.02
Kiss me needed it.

2601
02:06:56.02 --> 02:06:59.02
And that was what would your what would your tactic be on using that?

2602
02:06:59.02 --> 02:07:02.02
And usually it would be to.

2603
02:07:02.02 --> 02:07:05.02
You know, to create this order.

2604
02:07:05.02 --> 02:07:07.02
Because he hit somebody with tear gas.

2605
02:07:07.02 --> 02:07:09.02
If it's far away.

2606
02:07:09.02 --> 02:07:12.02
That would distract him for a second.

2607
02:07:12.02 --> 02:07:13.02
Take their mind off a business.

2608
02:07:13.02 --> 02:07:16.02
Or at least make them have a hard time to kill us.

2609
02:07:16.02 --> 02:07:20.02
And we also carried a grass a gas grenade local.

2610
02:07:20.02 --> 02:07:21.02
Okay.

2611
02:07:21.02 --> 02:07:23.02
So we had in our SOP.

2612
02:07:23.02 --> 02:07:26.02
A procedure that the word or I figured that was.

2613
02:07:26.02 --> 02:07:30.02
But we had a signal or a sign for CS gas.

2614
02:07:30.02 --> 02:07:37.02
So if we're getting so overrun to where the pop of CS to break the charg with some of our teams did.

2615
02:07:37.02 --> 02:07:42.02
They used it in an operation tailwind quite effectively saved your bacon.

2616
02:07:42.02 --> 02:07:45.02
So the idea would be hey, this is going to.

2617
02:07:45.02 --> 02:07:48.02
Linger whereas a frag grenade goes off.

2618
02:07:48.02 --> 02:07:49.02
You either wound guys or you don't.

2619
02:07:49.02 --> 02:07:50.02
You either kill guys or you don't.

2620
02:07:50.02 --> 02:07:51.02
But that's it.

2621
02:07:51.02 --> 02:07:52.02
It's over.

2622
02:07:52.02 --> 02:07:52.02
Yeah.

2623
02:07:52.02 --> 02:07:53.02
Whereas gas.

2624
02:07:53.02 --> 02:07:57.02
You can really disrupt them because now you got guys coughing and you can.

2625
02:07:57.02 --> 02:07:58.02
Yeah.

2626
02:07:58.02 --> 02:07:59.02
Puking and whatever.

2627
02:07:59.02 --> 02:08:02.02
And it's and it hangs to the ground and then it hangs around as long as the wind's.

2628
02:08:02.02 --> 02:08:04.02
It's going to let it hang around.

2629
02:08:04.02 --> 02:08:05.02
Got it.

2630
02:08:05.02 --> 02:08:07.02
Left pant pocket.

2631
02:08:07.02 --> 02:08:09.02
You had a marking panel large and small.

2632
02:08:09.02 --> 02:08:11.02
Right pant pocket.

2633
02:08:11.02 --> 02:08:12.02
Pen flares.

2634
02:08:12.02 --> 02:08:15.02
Dehydrated lyrp ration.

2635
02:08:15.02 --> 02:08:17.02
Bug repellent for leeches.

2636
02:08:17.02 --> 02:08:18.02
An extra covat.

2637
02:08:18.02 --> 02:08:19.02
An extra bandage.

2638
02:08:19.02 --> 02:08:21.02
Did anybody carry IV?

2639
02:08:21.02 --> 02:08:24.02
A silver or a guy's did.

2640
02:08:24.02 --> 02:08:25.02
Okay.

2641
02:08:25.02 --> 02:08:27.02
Lim black did and.

2642
02:08:27.02 --> 02:08:29.02
We had.

2643
02:08:29.02 --> 02:08:34.02
I think South carry one of our in ditch carry one we had an IV and the.

2644
02:08:34.02 --> 02:08:37.02
St.line solution that came in a canister.

2645
02:08:37.02 --> 02:08:39.02
So it always had one in case we needed.

2646
02:08:39.02 --> 02:08:40.02
Mm-hmm.

2647
02:08:40.02 --> 02:08:42.02
In your rock sack.

2648
02:08:42.02 --> 02:08:45.02
You got your you got your PRC 25.

2649
02:08:45.02 --> 02:08:47.02
Which you guys called the prick 25.

2650
02:08:47.02 --> 02:08:48.02
Yeah.

2651
02:08:48.02 --> 02:08:50.02
I think I was I think I was outlawed from calling it a prick.

2652
02:08:50.02 --> 02:08:52.02
That that PRC 25.

2653
02:08:52.02 --> 02:08:57.02
So the PRC 25 was replaced by the PR77 the.

2654
02:08:57.02 --> 02:09:02.02
Pro 77 and I was let us say it was 1969 or something like that when I got the

2655
02:09:02.02 --> 02:09:06.02
Seal team one that's what I used was a few is one of the radios that we had in our story

2656
02:09:06.02 --> 02:09:07.02
It was a PRC 7.

2657
02:09:07.02 --> 02:09:08.02
Yeah.

2658
02:09:08.02 --> 02:09:10.02
Which came directly from the PRC 25.

2659
02:09:10.02 --> 02:09:14.02
So you'd carry that you had the big whip antenna but you wouldn't you have the little

2660
02:09:14.02 --> 02:09:18.02
tape antenna on there so you don't right identified as the radio guy because otherwise you could

2661
02:09:18.02 --> 02:09:21.02
it.

2662
02:09:21.02 --> 02:09:22.02
Yeah.

2663
02:09:22.02 --> 02:09:23.02
Yeah.

2664
02:09:23.02 --> 02:09:25.02
Because you just hold it over.

2665
02:09:25.02 --> 02:09:28.02
And in our case the antenna we just get it and bend it down.

2666
02:09:28.02 --> 02:09:31.02
Come and eat your arm and stick it into the fatigue.

2667
02:09:31.02 --> 02:09:33.02
So be low profile on it.

2668
02:09:33.02 --> 02:09:35.02
Then you had your your one C rat of fruit.

2669
02:09:35.02 --> 02:09:39.02
That was like your that was your your go to indeed.

2670
02:09:39.02 --> 02:09:41.02
And you carry one of those two with us.

2671
02:09:41.02 --> 02:09:42.02
I'm like that.

2672
02:09:42.02 --> 02:09:47.02
You just one could after while you know we kept getting shot out so often.

2673
02:09:47.02 --> 02:09:50.02
It's like okay I'm not too much weight.

2674
02:09:50.02 --> 02:09:51.02
Yeah.

2675
02:09:51.02 --> 02:09:52.02
Yeah.

2676
02:09:52.02 --> 02:09:53.02
Yeah.

2677
02:09:53.02 --> 02:09:57.02
You had your extra mags and there you got an extra M79 rounds.

2678
02:09:57.02 --> 02:10:00.02
You had your army long sleeve sweater.

2679
02:10:00.02 --> 02:10:02.02
You had a plastic rain jacket.

2680
02:10:02.02 --> 02:10:05.02
Toilet paper even though you apparently never used it.

2681
02:10:05.02 --> 02:10:06.02
Correct.

2682
02:10:06.02 --> 02:10:08.02
But you've also used it the pack wounds.

2683
02:10:08.02 --> 02:10:09.02
There you go.

2684
02:10:09.02 --> 02:10:11.02
Extra battery.

2685
02:10:11.02 --> 02:10:16.02
For the for the prick 25 and the URC 10.

2686
02:10:16.02 --> 02:10:19.02
Extra smoke grenades.

2687
02:10:19.02 --> 02:10:21.02
Extra cantina water.

2688
02:10:21.02 --> 02:10:22.02
Extra ration.

2689
02:10:22.02 --> 02:10:28.02
And then you had your clay more or clay more with five and ten second fuses.

2690
02:10:28.02 --> 02:10:33.02
And on top of that that's 22 caliber hush puppy on some operations sometimes.

2691
02:10:33.02 --> 02:10:34.02
Yeah.

2692
02:10:34.02 --> 02:10:37.02
And all this when you'd weighed yourself you'd be about 90 pounds heavy.

2693
02:10:37.02 --> 02:10:38.02
Right around there.

2694
02:10:38.02 --> 02:10:39.02
Yeah.

2695
02:10:39.02 --> 02:10:41.02
And it was it was an old Rick the S scale.

2696
02:10:41.02 --> 02:10:44.02
So I just jumped on it carrying everything just to see what it was.

2697
02:10:44.02 --> 02:10:46.02
Well that's a heavy load out.

2698
02:10:46.02 --> 02:10:48.02
I'll tell you right now that's a heavy load out.

2699
02:10:48.02 --> 02:10:51.02
That is absolutely all of 90 pounds.

2700
02:10:51.02 --> 02:10:53.02
When you start talking about 600 rounds of ammunition.

2701
02:10:53.02 --> 02:10:59.02
We start talking about 10 to 12 hand grenades smoke smoke grenades are heavy as hell.

2702
02:10:59.02 --> 02:11:01.02
They got all that material in them.

2703
02:11:01.02 --> 02:11:02.02
That's folks.

2704
02:11:02.02 --> 02:11:03.02
Yeah.

2705
02:11:03.02 --> 02:11:04.02
They're big giant beasts.

2706
02:11:04.02 --> 02:11:05.02
And the Willie Peters.

2707
02:11:05.02 --> 02:11:06.02
The Willie Peters.

2708
02:11:06.02 --> 02:11:07.02
Have you do?

2709
02:11:07.02 --> 02:11:09.02
Uh.

2710
02:11:09.02 --> 02:11:12.02
Crazy mouth.

2711
02:11:12.02 --> 02:11:13.02
Um.

2712
02:11:13.02 --> 02:11:18.02
And I guess like I said and like you said you're carrying all that firepower.

2713
02:11:18.02 --> 02:11:23.02
Because the operations you're carrying a crazy amount of firepower because you're doing crazy operations.

2714
02:11:23.02 --> 02:11:24.02
Yeah.

2715
02:11:24.02 --> 02:11:26.02
And again, I'm talking to the other ones.

2716
02:11:26.02 --> 02:11:28.02
You're a Pat Walkins and Montgomery.

2717
02:11:28.02 --> 02:11:30.02
Because initially I don't know what the loads were.

2718
02:11:30.02 --> 02:11:32.02
But they kept increasing.

2719
02:11:32.02 --> 02:11:35.02
And because there was shovel time and they ran out of ammo.

2720
02:11:35.02 --> 02:11:37.02
Already got close to running out.

2721
02:11:37.02 --> 02:11:39.02
And that's the last thing in the world you want.

2722
02:11:39.02 --> 02:11:40.02
You know.

2723
02:11:40.02 --> 02:11:41.02
Yeah.

2724
02:11:41.02 --> 02:11:44.02
Awesome.

2725
02:11:44.02 --> 02:11:49.02
Well, you know, that's a little over two hours right now.

2726
02:11:49.02 --> 02:11:51.02
And it's been a quick night.

2727
02:11:51.02 --> 02:11:52.02
Yeah.

2728
02:11:52.02 --> 02:11:53.02
Indeed.

2729
02:11:53.02 --> 02:11:58.02
But you got any closing thoughts?

2730
02:11:58.02 --> 02:11:59.02
No.

2731
02:11:59.02 --> 02:12:03.02
Just to thank you for having me in three times.

2732
02:12:03.02 --> 02:12:05.02
We've gained some extra depth.

2733
02:12:05.02 --> 02:12:10.02
Like I said before, we were just chatting and said these stories always felt worse

2734
02:12:10.02 --> 02:12:16.02
and more significant in terms of the stories about what Sog did in the men, more importantly men.

2735
02:12:16.02 --> 02:12:20.02
And also like I said to you earlier, my stuff is hairy.

2736
02:12:20.02 --> 02:12:28.02
But if you had a hairy scale on one to ten, I mean, I feel I put myself at a five or six compared to the guys.

2737
02:12:28.02 --> 02:12:34.02
I got the metal boner to guys that didn't come home that went down fighting, getting over run by the NBA.

2738
02:12:34.02 --> 02:12:39.02
And we could just talk about metal boner missions of guys standing there just fighting.

2739
02:12:39.02 --> 02:12:45.02
And they're just fighting off and dying on the LZ, putting their people on the helicopter first.

2740
02:12:45.02 --> 02:12:54.02
John Caddenberg, Johnny Gallon, time and again, RSF guys would take care of the little people we even get them on the chopper, get them out.

2741
02:12:54.02 --> 02:12:58.02
And so those stories I felt was great valor.

2742
02:12:58.02 --> 02:13:02.02
And so I thank you for the little extra pleasure to your audience.

2743
02:13:02.02 --> 02:13:03.02
Well, we appreciate that.

2744
02:13:03.02 --> 02:13:08.02
We'll bring you back on and we'll get, and I know you and I are talking about

2745
02:13:08.02 --> 02:13:15.02
other guys that we're going to come on and all those stories of those heroes will we'll get them out there because

2746
02:13:15.02 --> 02:13:18.02
People want to know I want to hear them.

2747
02:13:18.02 --> 02:13:24.02
I want to know as much as I can about them and and and you know, we'll get you back.

2748
02:13:24.02 --> 02:13:25.02
I'm ready to roll.

2749
02:13:25.02 --> 02:13:30.02
So thank you and I thank you for the time and also you're on a, you're like Mr. social media now.

2750
02:13:30.02 --> 02:13:31.02
I didn't realize that.

2751
02:13:31.02 --> 02:13:33.02
You got to give me a full briefing where it's done.

2752
02:13:33.02 --> 02:13:35.02
So you're on Twitter.

2753
02:13:35.02 --> 02:13:38.02
You're on Twitter.

2754
02:13:38.02 --> 02:13:39.02
You're on Twitter.

2755
02:13:39.02 --> 02:13:41.02
We haven't quite figured out Twitter yet.

2756
02:13:41.02 --> 02:13:43.02
Apparently you're, and makes two of us.

2757
02:13:43.02 --> 02:13:48.02
Your old, your old Twitter handle was at Saga Chronicles.

2758
02:13:48.02 --> 02:13:53.02
Your new Twitter handle is at John Striker Meyer.

2759
02:13:53.02 --> 02:13:55.02
That's, that's where it's at right now.

2760
02:13:55.02 --> 02:13:56.02
Yes, sir.

2761
02:13:56.02 --> 02:13:56.02
That's right.

2762
02:13:56.02 --> 02:13:57.02
All right.

2763
02:13:57.02 --> 02:14:00.02
So people will start trying to communicate with you on that.

2764
02:14:00.02 --> 02:14:02.02
Good luck.

2765
02:14:02.02 --> 02:14:05.02
I'm going to call it a presence. Hey, President Trump. Could you help me out on my Twitter?

2766
02:14:05.02 --> 02:14:08.02
President Trump tweets all the time decaying a Twitter.

2767
02:14:08.02 --> 02:14:10.02
Yeah, yes, yes.

2768
02:14:10.02 --> 02:14:12.02
Hey, I'm sorry.

2769
02:14:12.02 --> 02:14:17.02
You'll be able to, you'll be able to, you'll, you'll, you'll, when you, that's the incredible thing about Twitter.

2770
02:14:17.02 --> 02:14:18.02
Yes.

2771
02:14:18.02 --> 02:14:19.02
Everybody has a platform.

2772
02:14:19.02 --> 02:14:20.02
It's incredibly good.

2773
02:14:20.02 --> 02:14:24.02
Sometimes it's incredibly bad, but everybody has a platform.

2774
02:14:24.02 --> 02:14:28.02
So no, the cool thing about it is people have been, you know,

2775
02:14:28.02 --> 02:14:32.02
talking to me and hitting me up and just thanking you for your service.

2776
02:14:32.02 --> 02:14:33.02
Thank you for coming on.

2777
02:14:33.02 --> 02:14:35.02
Thank you for sharing the story.

2778
02:14:35.02 --> 02:14:37.02
So it'll be cool that they'll be able to actually thank you.

2779
02:14:37.02 --> 02:14:38.02
Instead of just telling me to tell you things.

2780
02:14:38.02 --> 02:14:39.02
I just go to our website.

2781
02:14:39.02 --> 02:14:42.02
They got the link in there for email for the old fast and root.

2782
02:14:42.02 --> 02:14:43.02
Saga Chronicles.com.

2783
02:14:43.02 --> 02:14:44.02

2784
02:14:44.02 --> 02:14:45.02
Have one.

2785
02:14:45.02 --> 02:14:46.02
Yeah, people on there.

2786
02:14:46.02 --> 02:14:49.02
I wanted to close out reading one last thing.

2787
02:14:49.02 --> 02:14:52.02
And this is your, your dedication for the book,

2788
02:14:52.02 --> 02:14:53.02
Saga Chronicles.

2789
02:14:53.02 --> 02:14:54.02
One.

2790
02:14:54.02 --> 02:14:57.02
And it said it says this book is dedicated to the

2791
02:14:57.02 --> 02:15:01.02
Saga Men and their courageous indigenous team members who went across the fence and the

2792
02:15:01.02 --> 02:15:06.02
Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam during the eight year secret war.

2793
02:15:06.02 --> 02:15:09.02
And to the end to the brave aviators and crew members of the army,

2794
02:15:09.02 --> 02:15:13.02
Air Force Marine Corps and our fearless allies from the

2795
02:15:13.02 --> 02:15:17.02
219th South Vietnamese Air Force's special operation squadron,

2796
02:15:17.02 --> 02:15:21.02
Blegendary Kingbees who supported, who supported,

2797
02:15:21.02 --> 02:15:24.02
Saga teams on the ground.

2798
02:15:24.02 --> 02:15:30.02
This book is also for every man in Saga and the aviators who made the ultimate sacrifice

2799
02:15:30.02 --> 02:15:39.02
far outside the boundaries of conventional Vietnam war that America saw reported on the nightly news.

2800
02:15:39.02 --> 02:15:41.02
I'll give the closing note.

2801
02:15:41.02 --> 02:15:49.02
Today, 1,598 Americans that are MIA and South these days are from the Vietnam war.

2802
02:15:49.02 --> 02:15:57.02
50 green berets alone in Laos are still MIA, including 140 plus aviators that died

2803
02:15:57.02 --> 02:15:59.02
strictly supporting our mission.

2804
02:15:59.02 --> 02:16:05.02
And this week, the National League of POWMIA found is having a 50th annual meeting in

2805
02:16:05.02 --> 02:16:08.02
Arlington on this topic.

2806
02:16:08.02 --> 02:16:13.02
They've been diligent and the M. Mills Griffiths is the CEO.

2807
02:16:13.02 --> 02:16:14.02
She's putting it all together.

2808
02:16:14.02 --> 02:16:16.02
They work with the Pentagon.

2809
02:16:16.02 --> 02:16:18.02
She'd been on this mission for day one.

2810
02:16:18.02 --> 02:16:23.02
And our prayers are with them to continue because they're pushing to bring our people home.

2811
02:16:23.02 --> 02:16:24.02
Absolutely.

2812
02:16:24.02 --> 02:16:30.02
And if you want to put that out either on Saga Chronicles, put a link to how people can support that cause.

2813
02:16:30.02 --> 02:16:33.02
People will absolutely support that cause.

2814
02:16:33.02 --> 02:16:34.02
Okay.

2815
02:16:34.02 --> 02:16:35.02
We'll do that.

2816
02:16:35.02 --> 02:16:36.02
Absolutely.

2817
02:16:36.02 --> 02:16:36.02
They deserve it.

2818
02:16:36.02 --> 02:16:37.02
Yes, absolutely.

2819
02:16:37.02 --> 02:16:38.02
We can make that happen.

2820
02:16:38.02 --> 02:16:39.02
Wow.

2821
02:16:39.02 --> 02:16:39.02
Thank you.

2822
02:16:39.02 --> 02:16:40.02
Airborne.

2823
02:16:40.02 --> 02:16:43.02
All right. Well, like I said, you haven't opened in invite on here.

2824
02:16:43.02 --> 02:16:45.02
Anytime you want, you let us know.

2825
02:16:45.02 --> 02:16:48.02
We're here. And we'll get some of your friends on.

2826
02:16:48.02 --> 02:16:50.02
And thanks for coming on yourself.

2827
02:16:50.02 --> 02:16:53.02
Thanks for sharing your stories and most of all.

2828
02:16:53.02 --> 02:16:54.02
More than anything else.

2829
02:16:54.02 --> 02:16:56.02
Thanks for your service and sacrifice.

2830
02:16:56.02 --> 02:16:57.02
Likewise, brother, you've been there.

2831
02:16:57.02 --> 02:16:58.02
You've seen the elephant.

2832
02:16:58.02 --> 02:17:01.02
Appreciate it.

2833
02:17:01.02 --> 02:17:07.02
And once again, John Stryker Meyer has left the building.

2834
02:17:07.02 --> 02:17:08.02
Tilt.

2835
02:17:08.02 --> 02:17:09.02
Tilt.

2836
02:17:09.02 --> 02:17:11.02
Has left the building.

2837
02:17:11.02 --> 02:17:18.02
Finishing up three podcasts with John Stryker Meyer.

2838
02:17:18.02 --> 02:17:19.02
Yeah.

2839
02:17:19.02 --> 02:17:21.02
Sappers.

2840
02:17:21.02 --> 02:17:22.02
Sappers.

2841
02:17:22.02 --> 02:17:24.02
I asked him what Sappers was.

2842
02:17:24.02 --> 02:17:25.02
Workers.

2843
02:17:25.02 --> 02:17:27.02
There's various references.

2844
02:17:27.02 --> 02:17:30.02
First, second, and this past one to Sappers.

2845
02:17:30.02 --> 02:17:36.02
And more notably, one, if you remember, then we'd be preded to the first one.

2846
02:17:36.02 --> 02:17:39.02
He says, Sappers, still Sappers been on a sense.

2847
02:17:39.02 --> 02:17:41.02
I love all of all, whatever that's interesting.

2848
02:17:41.02 --> 02:17:44.02
And I always wondered, what's a Sapper?

2849
02:17:44.02 --> 02:17:51.02
Special group, Vietnam, North Vietnamese group of anti-American fighters.

2850
02:17:51.02 --> 02:17:54.02
Train specifically, right?

2851
02:17:54.02 --> 02:17:55.02
Right?

2852
02:17:55.02 --> 02:17:56.02
I got that right.

2853
02:17:56.02 --> 02:17:57.02
Did I remember that correctly?

2854
02:17:57.02 --> 02:18:02.02
Yeah, that's the definition that John Stryker Meyer just gave you.

2855
02:18:02.02 --> 02:18:03.02
Yeah.

2856
02:18:03.02 --> 02:18:05.02
All right.

2857
02:18:05.02 --> 02:18:06.02
Cool.

2858
02:18:06.02 --> 02:18:07.02
What else?

2859
02:18:07.02 --> 02:18:11.02
Well, I would say, no, awesome.

2860
02:18:11.02 --> 02:18:15.02
Awesome to have John Stryker Meyer on here.

2861
02:18:15.02 --> 02:18:24.02
And just to hear him talk about what human beings can do.

2862
02:18:24.02 --> 02:18:25.02
Right?

2863
02:18:25.02 --> 02:18:28.02
What people, human beings, can do.

2864
02:18:28.02 --> 02:18:31.02
And it's interesting, because you ever look at dogs and you think, oh, there's a little

2865
02:18:31.02 --> 02:18:32.02
tiny chihuahua.

2866
02:18:32.02 --> 02:18:35.02
And then there's like a German Shepherd.

2867
02:18:35.02 --> 02:18:36.02
Yeah.

2868
02:18:36.02 --> 02:18:38.02
And you think those are the same animal?

2869
02:18:38.02 --> 02:18:39.02
Right?

2870
02:18:39.02 --> 02:18:40.02
Yes.

2871
02:18:40.02 --> 02:18:41.02
They are.

2872
02:18:41.02 --> 02:18:42.02
Technically.

2873
02:18:42.02 --> 02:18:43.02
Yeah.

2874
02:18:43.02 --> 02:18:44.02
Human beings.

2875
02:18:44.02 --> 02:18:45.02
Think, you know.

2876
02:18:45.02 --> 02:18:47.02
Like you look at John Stryker Meyer.

2877
02:18:47.02 --> 02:18:49.02
He's like a German Shepherd.

2878
02:18:49.02 --> 02:18:50.02
Yeah.

2879
02:18:50.02 --> 02:18:52.02
And then you got people running around their chihuahua.

2880
02:18:52.02 --> 02:18:55.02
No, it depends against the chihuahua, but your chihuahua is not going to...

2881
02:18:55.02 --> 02:18:56.02
Yes.

2882
02:18:56.02 --> 02:18:57.02
Fend off hordes.

2883
02:18:57.02 --> 02:18:58.02
No.

2884
02:18:58.02 --> 02:18:59.02
No.

2885
02:18:59.02 --> 02:19:01.02
Chihuahua is not calling an Airstrikes danger close.

2886
02:19:01.02 --> 02:19:02.02
No.

2887
02:19:02.02 --> 02:19:06.02
I guess my point is that human beings do have capabilities.

2888
02:19:06.02 --> 02:19:15.02
And I think that when you listen to tilt, you realize that I can probably do better.

2889
02:19:15.02 --> 02:19:17.02
I know that's what I realize.

2890
02:19:17.02 --> 02:19:20.02
I think I can do better than I'm doing right now.

2891
02:19:20.02 --> 02:19:21.02
Yeah.

2892
02:19:21.02 --> 02:19:24.02
I think I can push the envelope a little bit.

2893
02:19:24.02 --> 02:19:27.02
Yeah.

2894
02:19:27.02 --> 02:19:31.02
Move further toward the potential.

2895
02:19:31.02 --> 02:19:38.02
The part that kind of, well, probably will stick with me is how he didn't carry

2896
02:19:38.02 --> 02:19:40.02
Panture, like the sleepings, no comps.

2897
02:19:40.02 --> 02:19:41.02
No comps.

2898
02:19:41.02 --> 02:19:42.02
No comps.

2899
02:19:42.02 --> 02:19:45.02
If we have to go sleep, I'm just going to sleep right here in the kitchen.

2900
02:19:45.02 --> 02:19:46.02
Yeah.

2901
02:19:46.02 --> 02:19:47.02
In the kitchen.

2902
02:19:47.02 --> 02:19:48.02
On the aunt hill.

2903
02:19:48.02 --> 02:19:49.02
Yeah.

2904
02:19:49.02 --> 02:19:51.02
That part.

2905
02:19:51.02 --> 02:19:56.02
When I was a kid, I was a kid.

2906
02:19:56.02 --> 02:19:59.02
But now you need comfort.

2907
02:19:59.02 --> 02:20:01.02
Yeah.

2908
02:20:01.02 --> 02:20:05.02
So that part, maybe I have to mentally, maybe work on that.

2909
02:20:05.02 --> 02:20:06.02
All right.

2910
02:20:06.02 --> 02:20:07.02
It's facing it.

2911
02:20:07.02 --> 02:20:09.02
There are ways to get better.

2912
02:20:09.02 --> 02:20:10.02
Yes or there is.

2913
02:20:10.02 --> 02:20:13.02
Maybe sleeping without a ground pad is one of them.

2914
02:20:13.02 --> 02:20:14.02
Yeah.

2915
02:20:14.02 --> 02:20:16.02
Maybe another one is train, Gigiatu.

2916
02:20:16.02 --> 02:20:17.02
Oh yeah.

2917
02:20:17.02 --> 02:20:18.02
Big time.

2918
02:20:18.02 --> 02:20:23.02
That's a, I mean, so I was training the other day with Noah Oliver, right?

2919
02:20:23.02 --> 02:20:28.02
And Noah's been training and he's kind of sorting out, you know how you go in phases of training partners.

2920
02:20:28.02 --> 02:20:29.02
You know how you go.

2921
02:20:29.02 --> 02:20:33.02
But I've been training with Andy for like the last like three months, you know, more than it.

2922
02:20:33.02 --> 02:20:38.02
So man, but he's been like beat me down the other day yesterday.

2923
02:20:38.02 --> 02:20:39.02
Yes or whatever.

2924
02:20:39.02 --> 02:20:42.02
And yeah, he beat me down.

2925
02:20:42.02 --> 02:20:48.02
But at the same time, I didn't leave thinking like, oh my gosh, you're just socks.

2926
02:20:48.02 --> 02:20:53.02
You know, when you get beat down, you think of, okay, what do I need to do to that's the correct data?

2927
02:20:53.02 --> 02:20:54.02
Yeah.

2928
02:20:54.02 --> 02:20:58.000
Well, especially when you have training partners that you like and you trust and you, you know, you

2929
02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:02.000
enjoy what you get from the training where every garnish you got beat down or not.

2930
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.000
I think your mind ought to, well, start automatically go to that.

2931
02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:11.000
I think most of the time it's usually when, I don't know, it's other circumstances then you'll be all salty.

2932
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Make excuses or something like that.

2933
02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Either way, so I'm thinking, you know, of all the things and then I arrive at the concept of man,

2934
02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:25.000
in any other situation, you take that kind of like just physical turmoil.

2935
02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:30.000
That only did get beat, but it was that kind of heart, you know.

2936
02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Usually I don't feel this good about it.

2937
02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000
I'm not looking forward to the next time, you know, like, come on, let's face it.

2938
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
You do a hard and met con, you're like boom, I'm glad that's over with it.

2939
02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
But in this case, you are looking forward to the next one.

2940
02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Yeah, you're looking forward to the next one, you're looking forward to just training more in general.

2941
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:50.000
There's a short term and long term pay off for this.

2942
02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Judzitsuit thing.

2943
02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Interesting.

2944
02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Oh yeah.

2945
02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Very true.

2946
02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.000
I've got to mention the capability that you wind up with.

2947
02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
So we're pro-Juget series, what we're dedicated to.

2948
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:02.000
We are 100,000 percent short term and long term.

2949
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
There's no, there's no dichotomy.

2950
02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
There's just short term gain, long term gain.

2951
02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Yes, in my opinion.

2952
02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:11.000
But it could be argued that, oh, it's hard.

2953
02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
What about the days?

2954
02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
What about sometimes when people don't want to train?

2955
02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
They let the jigset to window close.

2956
02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Like, we confirmed is a thing.

2957
02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:21.000
It is a thing, but that's, you know what I kind of arrived at as well.

2958
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:26.000
The days that you actually don't want to train are way more rare than you might think.

2959
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:29.000
Like, if you ever said, man, I really don't feel like training.

2960
02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:33.000
And then you make the drive to the gym, you get to the gym, you train in part and you show up.

2961
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.000
You write when you go to shake hands and you still feel like,

2962
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Oh, I really don't want to train in our business.

2963
02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Do you have those?

2964
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Never have.

2965
02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Never, right?

2966
02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Hardly ever.

2967
02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.000
I can't think of one single time.

2968
02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.000
I thought I came to the gym one time and I got there.

2969
02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:50.000
And I was like, I still don't want to train, but it was because there was only like,

2970
02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000
three people there and they were like really brand new at the time.

2971
02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:57.000
And then I was like, and I just went home one time and my whole life.

2972
02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:01.000
But I did, I legitimately did not feel like training anyway.

2973
02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Legitement.

2974
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Usually, if you don't feel like training, it's not that you don't feel like training.

2975
02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000
It's not that you don't feel like training.

2976
02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:17.000
It's, you don't feel like getting off the couch, getting into your car, getting your gear, getting,

2977
02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.000
doing that.

2978
02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.000
That's what you don't feel like doing.

2979
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Oh, you feel like training because when it's time to train, it's good fun.

2980
02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Every single time.

2981
02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.000
That's what I think.

2982
02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.000
It's a weird aspect that GG2 is fun.

2983
02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000
It's fun.

2984
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Yeah.

2985
02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:38.000
I have a feeling sometimes when I train GG2 where I'm literally like kind of beside myself with how

2986
02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:39.000
fun that just.

2987
02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Oh, yeah.

2988
02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Yeah.

2989
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:45.000
And that's sometimes I'm getting beat down and I'm thinking that sometimes I'm winning

2990
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000
something.

2991
02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:55.000
But either way, I'm like, that was it's kind of like a feeling that's very hard to to describe.

2992
02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Even.

2993
02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Yeah.

2994
02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:58.000
I would agree with that.

2995
02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Yeah.

2996
02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Because you have that obviously the physical part of it.

2997
02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Right.

2998
02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Yeah.

2999
02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Yeah.

3000
02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:05.000
That's always good.

3001
02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:06.000
You know that.

3002
02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.000
But this is like, it's like, especially if you roll with like guys who are like, good.

3003
02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:13.000
They're not good because they're so athletic, even though they might be athletic.

3004
02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:14.000
They're good because they know what to do.

3005
02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Like a Dean, Mr. like Greg McIntyre.

3006
02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.000
These guys who like Greg.

3007
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Greg, Greg.

3008
02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Greg, Greg, if you don't think you're way into or out of your situation you want, man, you're

3009
02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000
you're just not going to do it.

3010
02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:32.000
You know, so it's that problem solving task that's just intertwined in the whole thing.

3011
02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.000
I think that's what makes it fun.

3012
02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000
That's what I think.

3013
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Agreed.

3014
02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Anyway, GG, no GG streets, whatever.

3015
02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:42.000
If you want to do GG, you're going to need a GG.

3016
02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:46.000
You get a GG from origin, origin made up of us.

3017
02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000
We can get the GG very selections on there.

3018
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:50.000
The best.

3019
02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Made in America, by the way.

3020
02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Made in America.

3021
02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Yeah.

3022
02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.000
And just kind of massive shipment of cotton.

3023
02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
I'm talking not talking woven.

3024
02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.000
I'm talking unwoven little strands of cotton.

3025
02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Check out the Instagram.

3026
02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.000
There's palettes and palettes that are there.

3027
02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:11.000
And it's just, you think, okay, this cotton is going to get woven.

3028
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000
And then turned into geese that I'm going to wear.

3029
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
What does cotton look like when it comes to palettes?

3030
02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Because we want to use this little spools of, and it's not even, it's not just cotton,

3031
02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
by the way, it's a blended material.

3032
02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000
So it's like, modern.

3033
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Yeah.

3034
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.000
It's like a spool, but it's thick, a little bit thicker.

3035
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Good.

3036
02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.000
And that all gets woven together.

3037
02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
We used to grow cotton when I was young.

3038
02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000
And the yard.

3039
02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:34.000
I'm quite.

3040
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Really.

3041
02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:36.000
For what purpose?

3042
02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Just, that's just how I guess.

3043
02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.000
I don't know.

3044
02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Did you do something with?

3045
02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.000
I don't know.

3046
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.000
Random.

3047
02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:46.000
It was a row of cotton trees.

3048
02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:52.000
So cotton is like a, it's like almost like a pod that turns inside out like a popcorn almost.

3049
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Yeah.

3050
02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000
If I remember correctly.

3051
02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.000
And so that cotton would be balls of cotton.

3052
02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
You know, like you get, you know, when you buy cotton balls?

3053
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Yeah.

3054
02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Or, I'm sure you always buy cotton balls.

3055
02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
But when you buy cotton balls, they're in balls.

3056
02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.000
They're kind of like that, but more like there's not, they're not in a ball.

3057
02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.000
They're in a big clump.

3058
02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Okay.

3059
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:10.000
But there's seeds all in there.

3060
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:13.000
You got to pick out the seeds and the seeds are all stuck to the cotton.

3061
02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
I thought that's how they came.

3062
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
But they're, they're twined in order.

3063
02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Yes.

3064
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Spongebob.

3065
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Yeah.

3066
02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Into string.

3067
02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000
All right.

3068
02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.000
So we got cotton.

3069
02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:24.000
We got geese.

3070
02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000
We got jeans.

3071
02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Also.

3072
02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:27.000
I got jeans.

3073
02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:27.000
By the way.

3074
02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Oh, so you're in the game now.

3075
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000
I am totally in the game.

3076
02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
And I'm surprised how good, how good.

3077
02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Okay.

3078
02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Good.

3079
02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:33.000
American denim.

3080
02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Sure.

3081
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.000
The buttons.

3082
02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Brass.

3083
02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
When I see them, sure, I'm impressed.

3084
02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:43.000
But I'm, maybe I'm more surprised on top of the impress of how they fit.

3085
02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Next level.

3086
02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:48.000
I thought they were going to be like the kind of older, just generic feeding worker jeans.

3087
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Which is fine.

3088
02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.000
I get it.

3089
02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.000
But that's not really what I was like deep down hoping for.

3090
02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
I was hoping for the kind that, you know, I can put on.

3091
02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.000
I can wear to, you know, if I go somewhere special with my life or something like that.

3092
02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Use putting on those origin jeans.

3093
02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.000
No.

3094
02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.000
You can't.

3095
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Yes. They're very good. They fit good.

3096
02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Hand it to Pete.

3097
02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Yeah.

3098
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.000
That stylish fashion dude.

3099
02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
They even fit a bit.

3100
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:14.000
They even fit skinny knees.

3101
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
All right.

3102
02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.000
T-shirts.

3103
02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Jeans.

3104
02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Gies.

3105
02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Rascar's joggers.

3106
02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Supplements.

3107
02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Yes.

3108
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Supplements.

3109
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Get your joint warfare.

3110
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Get your krill oil.

3111
02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Get your discipline.

3112
02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Get your discipline.

3113
02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Go.

3114
02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Get these things.

3115
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.000
They will.

3116
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:36.000
They will make your life better.

3117
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000
That's crazy.

3118
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
That sounds.

3119
02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000
They will make your life better as will.

3120
02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Mulk.

3121
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Yes.

3122
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
And some people say what is mulk.

3123
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
And the answer is very clear.

3124
02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Mulk is.

3125
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Mulk is mulk.

3126
02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.000
That's right.

3127
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Mulk is mulk.

3128
02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:52.000
You can't just call it something.

3129
02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
You can't call.

3130
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000
You can't call a knife by some other name.

3131
02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Right.

3132
02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Right.

3133
02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.000
It's a knife.

3134
02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Yeah.

3135
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000
So you can't call mulk.

3136
02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:04.000
You can't say mulk is something else.

3137
02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:05.000
No.

3138
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Mulk is mulk.

3139
02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Then again I'm in heaven.

3140
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Don't fall that.

3141
02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
You can't call the knife a chunk.

3142
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Okay.

3143
02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.000
A blade.

3144
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Yeah.

3145
02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:14.000
You're right.

3146
02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Cold steel.

3147
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
There's a lot of words for a knife.

3148
02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:18.000
So there's other words for mulk.

3149
02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000
That is where you're saying.

3150
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:20.000
No.

3151
02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.000
I'm not saying that.

3152
02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Just say mulk is mulk.

3153
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Yes.

3154
02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.000
It is a dessert in the shape of a protein powder.

3155
02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000
That's healthy.

3156
02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Okay.

3157
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:32.000
So you can either call that or you can call a mulk.

3158
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.000
It tastes like dessert.

3159
02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000
And yet it's good for you and gives you protein.

3160
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Strawberry is delicious.

3161
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Mint chocolate chip.

3162
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.000
I had so much strawberry.

3163
02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
I had to go back to mint and I was like,

3164
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Good.

3165
02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000
It's crazy.

3166
02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Mint is delicious.

3167
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
What do you want?

3168
02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Mint chocolate chip ice cream milkshake or do you want to mint mulk?

3169
02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Oh, I'll take the mint mulk all day long.

3170
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Oh yeah.

3171
02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Short and long term bail.

3172
02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Short and long term bail off.

3173
02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Peanut butter, Reese's cup.

3174
02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
I don't know if you're allowed to say Reese's cup,

3175
02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
but that's basically what you're saying.

3176
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Peanut butter Reese's cup, but it's peanut butter

3177
02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.000
and chocolate mulk tasty.

3178
02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:08.000
What am I missing?

3179
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Vanilla.

3180
02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000
I'm not a vanilla guy.

3181
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
I don't like the vanilla yogurt.

3182
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000
I don't like vanilla.

3183
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Vanilla.

3184
02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Vanilla mulk is.

3185
02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
It's if you like vanilla, you're good.

3186
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Right.

3187
02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
If you don't like vanilla, you don't don't get it.

3188
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.000
There's a whole hoard of vanilla like this.

3189
02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Yeah, for sure.

3190
02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:25.000
But the thing that's cool about vanilla,

3191
02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
I guess is that you can do other things with it.

3192
02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Yeah.

3193
02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Jason Gardner put it in your morning coffee.

3194
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Head it with the, he likes to say,

3195
02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:35.000
hit it with the blender stick.

3196
02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Right?

3197
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
You know, people some people like to say things.

3198
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Yes, they do.

3199
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:40.000
He's like, I hate it.

3200
02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000
He gets all fired up through.

3201
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
I hate it with that blender stick.

3202
02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
He calls it a blender stick.

3203
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
So they're Jason Gardner.

3204
02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.000
So in Jason Gardner's,

3205
02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:54.000
he's a great shape getting after it.

3206
02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000
So maybe it maybe is a positive thing.

3207
02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.000
And no forget that there's a warrior kid moke.

3208
02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Because do you want to feed your child poison?

3209
02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.000
No.

3210
02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Do you?

3211
02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000
I do not.

3212
02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Okay.

3213
02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Cool.

3214
02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Then you get a moke.

3215
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Do you want your kid to be miserable when they eat

3216
02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
because what you're feeding them tastes disgusting?

3217
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Let me think.

3218
02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.000
No.

3219
02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Okay.

3220
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Cool.

3221
02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.000
So you give a moke.

3222
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:20.000
And you're being healthy.

3223
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.000
And you're taking care of your kid.

3224
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:22.000
And you're actually being a good parent.

3225
02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Oh yeah.

3226
02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Otherwise you're neglecting your child's welfare.

3227
02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Don't do it.

3228
02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Yeah.

3229
02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Moke, strawberry moke, chocolate moke gets on.

3230
02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Let's true.

3231
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:33.000
My daughter's in this phase.

3232
02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Hopefully short where she's comparing her body

3233
02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
with other people's body.

3234
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Oh yeah.

3235
02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:40.000
That'll be a short phase.

3236
02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
It only lasts like 500 years.

3237
02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.000
So man, it kind of makes you think like,

3238
02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Oh shoot.

3239
02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.000
She's paying attention now.

3240
02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:49.000
She's going to get in your gut.

3241
02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:50.000
And it's going to.

3242
02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Oh yeah.

3243
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Whatever.

3244
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Anyway.

3245
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:54.000
So.

3246
02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:57.000
What is your when they're going to do curls?

3247
02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Yeah.

3248
02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Pushups.

3249
02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Actually she does burp.

3250
02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:01.000
You know what I tell her?

3251
02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:02.000
It's kind of a trick.

3252
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.000
I don't know.

3253
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Tell me if you think this is a lie.

3254
02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:08.000
So she'll be like, hey, I don't really feel like doing the workout today.

3255
02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.000
So I say, okay, you don't have to do the workout.

3256
02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:13.000
If.

3257
02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.000
And only if you do burpees and pushups.

3258
02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:19.000
Kind of like burpees and pushups are not the workout.

3259
02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Even though that is the workout.

3260
02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Oh yeah.

3261
02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:26.000
It's like 70 burpees and like 40 pushups or something like that.

3262
02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000
That's the whole workout.

3263
02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:30.000
I'm going to make a six year old do a full on met Connor and nothing like that.

3264
02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
But I say, you don't have to do the workout.

3265
02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.000
You only have to do the pushups.

3266
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.000
The burps.

3267
02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:35.000
She's like, okay.

3268
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.000
You know, kind of like she has to work out even though that is where is that lying?

3269
02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:39.000
That's flanking, right?

3270
02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Yeah.

3271
02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:41.000
It's a flake.

3272
02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Hell yeah.

3273
02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:43.000
And the last step.

3274
02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:44.000
You're good.

3275
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.000
I'd say.

3276
02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Yeah.

3277
02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:49.000
I mean, you know, when when you know, she's still a girl.

3278
02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:53.000
She's just a power body looks in all this stuff and being a sex man.

3279
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:57.000
And I kind of feel this overwhelming responsibility.

3280
02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Like, hey, if she starts like putting on weight that she doesn't like or something like that,

3281
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:03.000
it's kind of my fault.

3282
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
You know, at this point it is.

3283
02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:06.000
For sure.

3284
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:10.000
So the more you can feel real good about it, especially that she likes it.

3285
02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.000
You know, and that's job very one is, I don't know how they did that.

3286
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:15.000
But keep doing it.

3287
02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000
That's what I know.

3288
02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Anyway, also, juggle white tea.

3289
02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Yes.

3290
02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Can you get addicted to juggle white tea?

3291
02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
The answer is yes.

3292
02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Yes.

3293
02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000
It's psychological.

3294
02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000
J.P. to know.

3295
02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000
J.P. to know is my brother.

3296
02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Currently addicted to juggle white tea.

3297
02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.000
I'm talking about him.

3298
02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:36.000
I'm saying the boys got a little bit of an addiction problem with juggle white tea.

3299
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.000
All right.

3300
02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Well, there you go.

3301
02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.000
And I mean, I'm sure I haven't thought about that much, but I'm sure there is some drawbacks.

3302
02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Being addicted to juggle white tea.

3303
02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:44.000
I don't know.

3304
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:47.000
But from here, I mean, the intuitive thought is that man.

3305
02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:50.000
That's all upside addicted to good stuff.

3306
02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Yeah.

3307
02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.000
You know, it's like, I am addicted to juggle white tea.

3308
02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:53.000
And I have an 8,000 pound dead left.

3309
02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:54.000
How's it going?

3310
02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Yeah.

3311
02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Probably way more now.

3312
02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Yeah.

3313
02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Probably like 1200 or something.

3314
02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Sure.

3315
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Anyway, you're juggle white tea is available.

3316
02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Kansas well, tea bags as well.

3317
02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:07.000
On the stores and the stores on Amazon everywhere.

3318
02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Mm-hmm.

3319
02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Get it.

3320
02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.000
But it's out there.

3321
02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Yeah.

3322
02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.000
For sure.

3323
02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Get your addiction on something good.

3324
02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Also, we have our own store speaking of the stores called juggle store.

3325
02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000
This is where you can get this clinical stream of shirts.

3326
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Like I said, juggle white tea is on the store.

3327
02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
It's on the store.

3328
02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Tins refills all that stuff.

3329
02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Hoodies, lightweight, and heavyweight hats.

3330
02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Rashcards.

3331
02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Rashcards.

3332
02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Rashcards.

3333
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000
A big time.

3334
02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Yeah.

3335
02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Oh, yeah.

3336
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000
If you want to represent the path while you're on the spot.

3337
02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000
And a rashcard today when I was doing a ring workout.

3338
02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Go on.

3339
02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Ring.

3340
02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.000
So I was using the rings.

3341
02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:42.000
And if you don't wear a rashcard when you're doing rings, if you do high reps,

3342
02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
you'll start to shave your arms a bunch.

3343
02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Which is no big deal.

3344
02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:49.000
But then you get like, you know, you're if you're doing jiu-jitsu, then you're starting to get a little

3345
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
infection exposures going on.

3346
02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
So just wear a rashcard.

3347
02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Yeah.

3348
02:33:53.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Also, you know, if you work at the bank or somewhere where people sort of have to have at least a little bit of trust in you.

3349
02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:04.000
If you're rolling around with shaved hands and arms and stuff, they're like, oh, proud.

3350
02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.000
What's up with this guy, you know?

3351
02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:06.000
They don't know that you're doing a rashcard.

3352
02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:07.000
I actually just feel like that more.

3353
02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Well, yeah, you, but you're like, you're like one, two levels like beyond.

3354
02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
You know, like in fight club.

3355
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:15.000
When, you know, well, this movie fight club where like, no, I've said that movie.

3356
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Yeah, you know, when he's at the restaurant, he sees that the two black eyes are broken nose and he trusts some more.

3357
02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
He's like, he gives him the nod, but an on-pours sense.

3358
02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Like, probably this guy with two black eyes broken nose, shaved arms, all this stuff.

3359
02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Who is this guy?

3360
02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Is a weirdo.

3361
02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:29.000
He's doing weirdo stuff.

3362
02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.000
He's doing deviant stuff.

3363
02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:31.000
That's for sure.

3364
02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:32.000
So you don't want that.

3365
02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:35.000
You don't want that on the surface is what I'm saying.

3366
02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Even though you like it.

3367
02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.000
So basically what you're saying is get a get a rashcard from the jockel store.

3368
02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
So you're not weird to other people.

3369
02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:44.000
That's what I just heard.

3370
02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Just to break it down.

3371
02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Simple fi, which is it.

3372
02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Also, subscribe to the podcast.

3373
02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:54.000
As I was, my kids, my children.

3374
02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:59.000
They were, they were going off about some social media thing.

3375
02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000
And they were like, smash the like button.

3376
02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:07.000
I laugh because my daughter says the same thing.

3377
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Yeah, so I'm going to tell you right now, if you're a little younger profile,

3378
02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:15.000
what I'm trying to say is smash the subscribe button.

3379
02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
Don't say that.

3380
02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Don't try to say that.

3381
02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Don't.

3382
02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:20.000
I don't say that.

3383
02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.000
I don't think you should go into that.

3384
02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
What the way if you're writing, it's like,

3385
02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:31.000
It's like, right into the share, like, subscribe.

3386
02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Yeah.

3387
02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.000
If you want, it's more, you know what, I'm going to embrace that.

3388

Right now share like and subscribe share like and subscribe share like and subscribe.

3389
02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:44.000

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Yeah, it's good.

Oh, no.

3392
02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:48.000
No.

3393
02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Because it's like, why, wait, why?

3394
02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
I'm not going to do it just because you said it's,

3395
02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
It should be more of like a reminder, right?

3396
02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Like if I was all motivational like, you know what you should

3397
02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
That like button, you got to smash that thing.

3398

All right.

3399
02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:02.000
They don't worry about it.

3400
02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:03.000
We're just kidding.

3401
02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.000

Just let's leave it a bit.

3405
02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Don't worry about smashing.

3406
02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:12.000
If you're going to smash something, smash your next workout.

3407
02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:13.000
Don't worry about the like button.

3408

3409
02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Smash a matcon.

3410
02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Yeah.

3411
02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:19.000
How's that?

3412
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Paying that was good.

3413
02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
That was actually really good.

3414
02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Anyway, also yes, where your kid podcast two,

3415
02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Let's not forget about that.

3416
02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Let's never forget it.

3417
02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Never.

3418
02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000
It's, it's hibernating a little bit.

3419
02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Sure.

3420
02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Some people have been commenting now.

3421
02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Yeah.

3422
02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Did somebody post a picture of like someone that was like,

3423
02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Undead.

3424
02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Sure.

3425
02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Yeah.

3426
02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Like the warrior kid podcast is by no means dead,

3427
02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:44.000
It lives on.

3428
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Yeah.

3429
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.000
And since I have just wrapped up a major project,

3430
02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.000
I will have some time, hopefully before.

3431
02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Certain people are not available to record to record.

3432
02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Yeah.

3433
02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Well, so there'll be some more coming.

3434
02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Yeah.

3435
02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Good.

3436
02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
And actually that kind of is important to note,

3437
02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
because you know, if they're like, hey,

3438
02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Yeah, it's done, and then they won't even, it won't be on their mind.

3439
02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:06.000
No, even on the lookout for it.

3440
02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Then it could go and notice when it does come back.

3441
02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000
And the last, it's going to come back.

3442
02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000
It doesn't have to come back.

3443
02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.000
It's there right now.

3444
02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:12.000
Right.

3445
02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:13.000
You're going to listen to an episode.

3446
02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:14.000
It's not.

3447
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.000
That's there.

3448
02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:16.000
All right.

3449
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Some people are just discovering that warrior kid podcast.

3450
02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.000

3451
02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Anyway, where is we going to wear kids,

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000

That's right.

3456
02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:31.000
This where you can get it.

3457
02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Troopers soap and jocco soap.

3458
02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Wait, does this still have the troopers soap?

3459
02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Or was that just a special thing?

3460
02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Yeah, man.

3461
02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:38.000
And that's legit.

3462
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:39.000
That one's on a rope.

3463
02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:40.000
But yeah.

3464
02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:41.000
And what's the slogan?

3465
02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
I'd say the slogan, but you say it, but we better make go ahead.

3466
02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:46.000
This slogan is simply stay clean.

3467
02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.000
There you go.

3468
02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000
I'll stand there.

3469
02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:51.000
We have a YouTube channel.

3470
02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:55.000
And what we would like is for you to smash this.

3471
02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Hey, we got a YouTube channel.

3472
02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:58.000
If you want to watch YouTube videos,

3473
02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:01.000
if you're not getting inundated with enough YouTube videos,

3474
02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:07.000
wasting your time watching videos of street fights,

3475
02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:12.000
watching videos of car crashes,

3476
02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:18.000
watching videos of acrobatic people climbing around in the city.

3477
02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Oh, the park where we're.

3478
02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Yeah.

3479
02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:23.000
You know what's fun is, like you're just totally putting yourself

3480
02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
on report about all the videos.

3481
02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Yeah, you're for sure.

3482
02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.000
These are the things.

3483
02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
Like, oh, you like to watch street fight videos.

3484
02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
The thing is YouTube knows what you like to watch.

3485
02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:35.000
So just puts up, you know, three on one.

3486
02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Do you just who involved?

3487
02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:40.000
I'm like, oh, somebody made that video for me.

3488
02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:45.000
So what I'm saying is subscribe to the YouTube channel,

3489
02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
if you want to see the videos that we put out.

3490
02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Otherwise, go watch some more junk profiles.

3491
02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
I don't really watch that one.

3492
02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.000
But I will watch like fast tactical reloads.

3493
02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Yeah.

3494
02:38:58.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Yeah.

3495
02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
So anyways, there you go.

3496
02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Boom. There it is. Yeah.

3497
02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000
YouTube.

3498
02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Also, psychological warfare.

3499
02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:07.000
If you don't know what that is, it's an album with tracks of

3500
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Jockelton, you had to get past moments of weakness.

3501
02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:10.000
If they may arise.

3502
02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
If they may arise.

3503
02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:15.000
I went to a, I didn't go to the donut shop.

3504
02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:16.000
I passed it.

3505
02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:19.000
There's a bank and there's a donut shop right by where it is.

3506
02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Isn't it weird that donut shops exist?

3507
02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Oh, they don't anymore. That was going to be my point.

3508
02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Zero people in there.

3509
02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:26.000
The lady in there.

3510
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:27.000
So we're winning.

3511
02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:27.000
You know what?

3512
02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:28.000
We're winning.

3513
02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000
We're going to win.

3514
02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.000
I even heard what you call crispy creams is like, either out of business or

3515
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.000
going out of business.

3516
02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.000
I don't know.

3517
02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Record rate or something like this.

3518
02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:43.000
But man, the lady in the donut shop was on her laptop in one of the

3519
02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
customer like tables on the seat.

3520
02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
You know, it was she wasn't behind the counter.

3521
02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:48.000
She was straight up.

3522
02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:49.000
She was coming in here.

3523
02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Yeah.

3524
02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:51.000
I was like, dang.

3525
02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Anyway, what should they replace all donut shops with?

3526
02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Stake houses.

3527
02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Yeah.

3528
02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Well, yeah.

3529
02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
I guess there's lots of houses.

3530
02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Do you have this?

3531
02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Do you have two?

3532
02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Yeah.

3533
02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Just like a vacant, you know what they should do.

3534
02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:07.000
A vacant building.

3535
02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:11.000
They clear out all the donut material and machines.

3536
02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
I don't know how you make donuts.

3537
02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:14.000
But clear out all that stuff.

3538
02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:17.000
And you just put one like mat space.

3539
02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:18.000
One mat space.

3540
02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:19.000
That's it.

3541
02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
And a paper and a pencil.

3542
02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:22.000
You just sign in a book.

3543
02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:23.000
I came in.

3544
02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Use this mat.

3545
02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Me, my partner.

3546
02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Come in, leave.

3547
02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:27.000
I like it.

3548
02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.000
I didn't really get through.

3549
02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:31.000
But nonetheless, psychological warfare, what I was saying is the

3550
02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Album tracks about Jocco, can you through your moments?

3551
02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:39.000
So what I've, what the report says that that psychological warfare, the album has

3552
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.000
done massive damage to the donut industry apparently is what's going on.

3553
02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:43.000
That's what I'm here.

3554
02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Yeah.

3555
02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Big time.

3556
02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.000

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
What kind of guy likes cool socks?

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:41.000
I don't know.

3577
02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:44.000
It's just, but there's a whole industry out there used to be.

3578
02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:47.000
And for me, it still is socks means one thing.

3579
02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Parallite socks.

3580
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.000

They got Iron Man.

3590
02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.000
They got some good ones on there.

3591
02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Also, they have like the things called that elk bars.

3592
02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:11.000
Same thing as a warrior bar, but it's kind of that elk high in protein.

3593
02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Really good.

3594
02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.000
Like, almost like a big beef jerky stick.

3595
02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:16.000
It's good.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:17.000

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Flash.

3601
02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Jocco.

3602
02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Like something.

3603
02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Also, we got some books that the books that were written by John Stracker Meyer,

3604
02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
the books by written by tilt.

3605
02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:33.000

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:39.000
And sog chronicles volume one.

3608
02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Check those books out there.

3609
02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:44.000
They're really amazing to read, especially.

3610
02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.000
And there are kind of books that when you read them, you have to actually slow down

3611
02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.000
and think about what the hell is actually going on.

3612
02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:57.000
Because when you think about what's actually going on, you'll realize that what these guys

3613
02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:00.000
were doing was just absolutely, completely insane.

3614
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
So check out those books.

3615
02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:06.000

And way the warrior kid two marks mission.

3619
02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.000
These are good books to get kids on the path.

3620
02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:21.000
All those little things that you want kids to know, but they don't really listen to you

3621
02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
because you're their parent.

3622
02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
This is the ultimate flank.

3623
02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:31.000
And if you listen to JP to now, he says that these warrior kid books are a flank on the parent too.

3624
02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Thank you.

3625
02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:33.000
It is there.

3626
02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:34.000
100%.

3627
02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Yeah, as is Mikey in the Dragons, which is a book for kids to learn how to overcome.

3628
02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:40.000
Fear.

3629
02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:41.000
So check those out.

3630
02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:42.000
Then we've got the discipline.

3631
02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:43.000
It goes for you to them.

3632
02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
Field manual.

3633
02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Which will tell you how to get after it.

3634
02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
You don't need to ask.

3635
02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
You can just get them manual.

3636
02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Wouldn't that be nice?

3637
02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:53.000
Yeah.

3638
02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Oh, it's true.

3639
02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000
It is nice.

3640
02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Yes.

3641
02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:57.000
You get that field manual and you're good to go.

3642
02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:04.000
If you want the audio version that it's on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google play and other MP3 platforms.

3643
02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
And then, of course, you got extreme ownership.

3644
02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.000
And then I caught a meal of leadership, the two books that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin,

3645
02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:16.80
talking about everything that we've learned in combat and how you can take those lessons.

3646
02:44:16.80 --> 02:44:23.56
And you can utilize them with your business, with your team, with your life.

3647
02:44:23.56 --> 02:44:24.56
So check those out.

3648
02:44:24.56 --> 02:44:25.92
Also, we got echelon front.

3649
02:44:25.92 --> 02:44:32.56
That's my leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems through leadership.

3650
02:44:32.56 --> 02:44:37.000
If you problem that exists in your organization, it's a leadership problem.

3651
02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:43.56
So if you need help fixing that leadership problem and thereby fixing the problems that you have inside your organization,

3652

If you need further instruction, if you want something beyond this podcast, if you want to come to the

3654
02:44:56.16 --> 02:45:03.16
Master, the Master is a leadership training seminar, I guess.

3655
02:45:03.16 --> 02:45:04.16
I'd call it.

3656
02:45:04.16 --> 02:45:06.16
It's a leadership convention.

3657
02:45:06.16 --> 02:45:12.16
And what we do is go deep dive, get granular on leadership.

3658
02:45:12.16 --> 02:45:15.16
The next one is September 19th and 20th in Denver.

3659
02:45:15.16 --> 02:45:19.16
And then after that, it's December 4th and 5th in Sydney, Australia.

3660
02:45:19.16 --> 02:45:21.16
Every single, we've done seven.

3661
02:45:21.16 --> 02:45:23.16
They've also told out these are going to sell out too.

3662
02:45:23.16 --> 02:45:26.16
So if you want to come, go to treemonership.com and sign up.

3663
02:45:26.16 --> 02:45:31.16

You can reinforce the skills.

3666
02:45:44.16 --> 02:45:48.16
The skills that I talk about on this podcast, the skills that we wrote about in the books,

3667
02:45:48.16 --> 02:45:53.16
those skills need further training all the time.

3668
02:45:53.16 --> 02:45:54.16
Never master these things.

3669
02:45:54.16 --> 02:45:56.16
So go to efonline.com and check that out.

3670
02:45:56.16 --> 02:46:03.16
And then there's, of course, a geof Overwatch where we've been taking proven leaders, tested

3671
02:46:03.16 --> 02:46:09.16
leaders from special operations and from combat aviation and putting them into companies

3672
02:46:09.16 --> 02:46:13.16
in the civilian sector that need leadership.

3673
02:46:13.16 --> 02:46:17.16
So if you're looking to hire, don't always hire just because someone has experience.

3674
02:46:17.16 --> 02:46:22.16
Higher, four character, higher, four leadership capability.

3675
02:46:22.16 --> 02:46:27.16
And then you teach them the industry specifics because that's easier than trying to teach someone

3676
02:46:27.16 --> 02:46:29.16
character or trying to teach someone leadership.

3677
