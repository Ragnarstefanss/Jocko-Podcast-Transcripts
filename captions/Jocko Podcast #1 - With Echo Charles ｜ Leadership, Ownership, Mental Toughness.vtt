1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.80
The pomegranate. What is the pomegranate?

2
00:00:02.80 --> 00:00:03.44
Chai.

3
00:00:03.44 --> 00:00:04.44
Light tea.

4
00:00:04.44 --> 00:00:05.44
Yep.

5
00:00:05.44 --> 00:00:06.44
That's what it is.

6
00:00:06.44 --> 00:00:07.44
What is your deep color?

7
00:00:07.44 --> 00:00:08.44
Your deep.

8
00:00:08.44 --> 00:00:10.24
So action.

9
00:00:10.24 --> 00:00:11.24
Action.

10
00:00:11.24 --> 00:00:13.44
All right.

11
00:00:13.44 --> 00:00:16.28
This right here is the first

12
00:00:16.28 --> 00:00:21.48
Jocco podcast.

13
00:00:21.48 --> 00:00:23.60
Here we go.

14
00:00:23.60 --> 00:00:26.64
I guess to start off

15
00:00:26.64 --> 00:00:32.64
how did we end up here? How did this happen?

16
00:00:32.64 --> 00:00:35.20
I guess I have to thank Tim Ferriss

17
00:00:35.20 --> 00:00:39.04
for initially having me on to his podcast.

18
00:00:39.04 --> 00:00:46.56
And that was via a couple of people that helped me out

19
00:00:46.56 --> 00:00:51.04
get on there, Kurt Pazley, Peter Latia.

20
00:00:51.04 --> 00:00:52.80
And they made some introductions

21
00:00:52.80 --> 00:00:59.28
and introduced me to Tim Ferriss. Tim had me on.

22
00:00:59.28 --> 00:01:02.56
Got a lot of good feedback on that show.

23
00:01:02.56 --> 00:01:06.52
And that led to me going on to Joe Rogan.

24
00:01:06.52 --> 00:01:10.20
So thanks to Joe Rogan for having me on as well.

25
00:01:10.20 --> 00:01:12.56
And once those two things happened,

26
00:01:12.56 --> 00:01:18.24
and I actually got online and started getting

27
00:01:18.24 --> 00:01:22.68
communicating with other human beings online.

28
00:01:22.68 --> 00:01:26.72
And they were asking, you should do a podcast

29
00:01:26.72 --> 00:01:28.76
because it was interesting.

30
00:01:28.76 --> 00:01:34.000
And both Joe and Tim told me to have a podcast

31
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.80
because it was interesting.

32
00:01:35.80 --> 00:01:42.96
So as I got all that feedback, which was awesome,

33
00:01:42.96 --> 00:01:46.76
I kind of realized I should do a podcast.

34
00:01:46.76 --> 00:01:48.24
So I'm sitting here.

35
00:01:48.24 --> 00:01:49.96
My name is Joko Joko Willink.

36
00:01:49.96 --> 00:01:52.72
I was, if you don't know anything about me.

37
00:01:52.72 --> 00:02:00.72
I served 20 years in the military, retired in 2010, myself.

38
00:02:00.72 --> 00:02:05.36
And one of my buddies, guy by the name of Lave Babin,

39
00:02:05.36 --> 00:02:09.64
we started a company where we do leadership and management

40
00:02:09.64 --> 00:02:12.60
consulting for businesses, doing all that work,

41
00:02:12.60 --> 00:02:16.08
eventually got us to a situation where we had some knowledge

42
00:02:16.08 --> 00:02:19.04
and kind of aggregated some knowledge.

43
00:02:19.04 --> 00:02:22.04
And so we put that into a book, the book came out,

44
00:02:22.04 --> 00:02:24.08
and been doing pretty well.

45
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:26.48
It's called Extreme Ownership.

46
00:02:26.48 --> 00:02:29.04
So that's who I am.

47
00:02:29.04 --> 00:02:33.40
Now I kind of sometimes find it a little strange

48
00:02:33.40 --> 00:02:34.88
just to be talking.

49
00:02:34.88 --> 00:02:39.44
And so as we decided to put this podcast together,

50
00:02:39.44 --> 00:02:44.000
at one point I had done some follow-up videos for Tim Ferris,

51
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.68
for him to put on line, and I did those with a buddy of mine

52
00:02:47.68 --> 00:02:49.80
who's sitting here with me now,

53
00:02:49.80 --> 00:02:54.12
guy by the name Echo Charles, who is a longtime,

54
00:02:54.12 --> 00:02:56.48
due to training partner of mine.

55
00:02:56.48 --> 00:02:59.92
And he does video production.

56
00:02:59.92 --> 00:03:04.40
He's got a company called FlexPoint TV.

57
00:03:04.40 --> 00:03:08.28
And whenever I got to do something video related,

58
00:03:08.28 --> 00:03:10.12
he's my go-to guy.

59
00:03:10.12 --> 00:03:12.60
And so when this came, this opportunity came about,

60
00:03:12.60 --> 00:03:15.04
and we were filming the videos for Tim Ferris,

61
00:03:15.04 --> 00:03:17.12
and we had questions from the internet,

62
00:03:17.12 --> 00:03:20.04
and we were sitting there and he's filming,

63
00:03:20.04 --> 00:03:22.24
and we were basically doing a podcast,

64
00:03:22.24 --> 00:03:24.12
because we were talking, and we have conversations

65
00:03:24.12 --> 00:03:27.48
about leadership and about jujitsu and about problems

66
00:03:27.48 --> 00:03:28.92
and about everything.

67
00:03:28.92 --> 00:03:32.28
And that kind of rolled into, when we started talking

68
00:03:32.28 --> 00:03:34.24
about doing a podcast, and I said,

69
00:03:34.24 --> 00:03:36.68
hey, do you have audio equipment?

70
00:03:36.68 --> 00:03:39.68
Do you have a recorder?

71
00:03:39.68 --> 00:03:42.56
Do you have time?

72
00:03:42.56 --> 00:03:44.92
Do you have time to sit down and hang out with me

73
00:03:44.92 --> 00:03:46.40
and do this?

74
00:03:46.40 --> 00:03:49.000
And I do.

75
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.56
He said I do.

76
00:03:50.56 --> 00:03:52.40
I do have all that stuff.

77
00:03:52.40 --> 00:03:54.24
And here we are.

78
00:03:54.24 --> 00:03:59.88
So then what we did was we took a bunch of questions

79
00:03:59.88 --> 00:04:02.16
that I got from online.

80
00:04:02.16 --> 00:04:03.76
People hit me with all kinds of different questions,

81
00:04:03.76 --> 00:04:05.28
which is awesome.

82
00:04:05.28 --> 00:04:09.20
Thanks to everybody for giving me that feedback

83
00:04:09.20 --> 00:04:11.72
and listening and talking and communicating with me.

84
00:04:11.72 --> 00:04:12.68
That's awesome.

85
00:04:12.68 --> 00:04:15.76
It's kind of weird because I've never been like

86
00:04:15.76 --> 00:04:18.36
the most social person in the world,

87
00:04:18.36 --> 00:04:23.52
and not that I feel lonely, because I never do.

88
00:04:23.52 --> 00:04:25.44
I don't care if I'm alone or not.

89
00:04:25.44 --> 00:04:27.56
So socially mean like online social.

90
00:04:27.56 --> 00:04:28.40
Definitely not.

91
00:04:28.40 --> 00:04:30.12
Definitely not online social.

92
00:04:30.12 --> 00:04:33.48
I mean, I had zero online presence prior to being on

93
00:04:33.48 --> 00:04:35.60
the Tim Ferriss podcast.

94
00:04:35.60 --> 00:04:43.56
And but even socially, I mean, I don't hang around with people.

95
00:04:43.56 --> 00:04:46.52
You know, I mean, I told you that like the last time I was over here,

96
00:04:46.52 --> 00:04:49.000
I said, hey, yeah, I just don't do that a lot.

97
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.68
So it's kind of interesting to me being online

98
00:04:51.68 --> 00:04:55.76
and communicating with really thousands of people.

99
00:04:55.76 --> 00:04:59.24
And it's cool because I'm not used to having people

100
00:04:59.24 --> 00:05:00.44
that are kind of interesting.

101
00:05:00.44 --> 00:05:02.40
The same thing I'm interested in, you know?

102
00:05:02.40 --> 00:05:04.04
The Gigiitsu, the working out,

103
00:05:04.04 --> 00:05:06.16
you don't want to do better, they want to get better.

104
00:05:06.16 --> 00:05:07.60
They want to learn more.

105
00:05:07.60 --> 00:05:09.36
That's what I want to do.

106
00:05:09.36 --> 00:05:12.16
And it's cool to be able to communicate with a bunch of people

107
00:05:12.16 --> 00:05:14.28
that want to do the same thing.

108
00:05:14.28 --> 00:05:18.04
And you know, I think that's what this podcast,

109
00:05:18.04 --> 00:05:21.88
which I know is going to evolve into all kinds of different things.

110
00:05:21.88 --> 00:05:26.88
But I think the underlying theme will be lessons learned.

111
00:05:28.36 --> 00:05:29.48
You know, lessons learned.

112
00:05:29.48 --> 00:05:31.36
I want to learn from people.

113
00:05:31.36 --> 00:05:35.04
I want people to, I want to pass on what I've learned.

114
00:05:35.04 --> 00:05:38.16
I don't want people to make the same mistakes I made.

115
00:05:38.16 --> 00:05:40.60
I want to learn other mistakes that people have made.

116
00:05:40.60 --> 00:05:42.72
So I don't make them.

117
00:05:42.72 --> 00:05:47.60
And I think that's kind of the underlying theme here

118
00:05:47.60 --> 00:05:49.48
with this.

119
00:05:49.48 --> 00:05:51.32
Yeah.

120
00:05:51.32 --> 00:05:52.40
What about you?

121
00:05:52.40 --> 00:05:54.92
I mean, is there anything in your background

122
00:05:54.92 --> 00:06:02.40
that you would consider to be important for people to know?

123
00:06:02.40 --> 00:06:05.08
Above and beyond what you just said, no.

124
00:06:05.08 --> 00:06:10.08
That's, those are the relevant points for sure.

125
00:06:10.08 --> 00:06:13.64
That's, that's, as we talked about doing this,

126
00:06:13.64 --> 00:06:19.000
that's one of the things that struck me as you're a director,

127
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.84
you know, for your business, you're a film director,

128
00:06:21.84 --> 00:06:23.16
and you don't get in front of the camera.

129
00:06:23.16 --> 00:06:24.32
That's not your thing.

130
00:06:24.32 --> 00:06:25.16
Right.

131
00:06:25.16 --> 00:06:28.52
And so that's why I think this interaction is good

132
00:06:28.52 --> 00:06:31.08
because you're, you draw things out of people.

133
00:06:31.08 --> 00:06:32.28
That's what a director does.

134
00:06:32.28 --> 00:06:33.28
Yeah.

135
00:06:33.28 --> 00:06:35.24
And I believe that's where you're going to be doing here.

136
00:06:35.24 --> 00:06:35.92
Yeah.

137
00:06:35.92 --> 00:06:39.68
Yes, especially what I did a lot of the Metamore stuff.

138
00:06:39.68 --> 00:06:43.64
That was essentially my, that's like maybe a third of the whole job.

139
00:06:43.64 --> 00:06:45.32
This is good stuff, how to.

140
00:06:45.32 --> 00:06:48.48
So the jujitsu players out there, if you followed Metamore

141
00:06:48.48 --> 00:06:51.52
and all the videos, the, what do they call,

142
00:06:51.52 --> 00:06:52.68
lead up videos?

143
00:06:52.68 --> 00:06:53.60
Yeah, like promo.

144
00:06:53.60 --> 00:06:54.72
No promo videos.

145
00:06:54.72 --> 00:06:56.000
For the matches, yeah.

146
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.16
Those were, count down.

147
00:06:57.16 --> 00:06:58.000
The kill downs.

148
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.60
That's right.

149
00:06:58.60 --> 00:07:02.24
Those were echo Charles material right there.

150
00:07:02.24 --> 00:07:05.04
So you to, occasionally hear his voice in the background,

151
00:07:05.04 --> 00:07:06.12
with a question.

152
00:07:06.12 --> 00:07:07.48
Yeah.

153
00:07:07.48 --> 00:07:09.08
So speaking to questions.

154
00:07:09.08 --> 00:07:10.08
Yeah.

155
00:07:10.08 --> 00:07:13.12
We got some questions from the, from the interwebs.

156
00:07:13.12 --> 00:07:15.60
Yeah.

157
00:07:15.60 --> 00:07:18.80
What we got for the first one here, we got.

158
00:07:18.80 --> 00:07:23.64
The first question is, why do you wake up early in the morning?

159
00:07:23.64 --> 00:07:26.000
Actually, this is, I kind of have the same question.

160
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Why?

161
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.76
Because I wake up late.

162
00:07:28.76 --> 00:07:31.04
Oh, I was in the night club industry for a long time.

163
00:07:31.04 --> 00:07:32.72
So my schedule was just shifted.

164
00:07:32.72 --> 00:07:37.84
I still, you know, work out and, and work hard for the most part

165
00:07:37.84 --> 00:07:40.20
during the day, but my schedule was just shifted.

166
00:07:40.20 --> 00:07:43.32
But I think a lot of times I'm viewed as like, oh, this is like late

167
00:07:43.32 --> 00:07:48.32
riser, like early risers just to begin with kind of seem like these.

168
00:07:48.32 --> 00:07:49.32
Just to blend.

169
00:07:49.32 --> 00:07:52.96
You know, but if you just shift the schedule a little bit forward, you know,

170
00:07:52.96 --> 00:07:54.76
you're up for, let's say you get eight hours the hour.

171
00:07:54.76 --> 00:07:57.60
I know you get less than eight hours sleep, but let's say the typical person

172
00:07:57.60 --> 00:07:59.60
eight hours sleep.

173
00:07:59.60 --> 00:08:04.40
If you get eight hours sleep, but you wake up at 430 versus you get the same

174
00:08:04.40 --> 00:08:09.16
eight hours, hours of sleep, same waking, you know, our, or the same hours

175
00:08:09.16 --> 00:08:11.12
a way you can do and work and work and just start.

176
00:08:11.12 --> 00:08:18.000
But you wake up at, in my case, noon, the cramps.

177
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Where?

178
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
What's the difference, really?

179
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.96
Well, they're technically, there is no difference.

180
00:08:22.96 --> 00:08:26.92
And actually, I've talked to people that they're on the night shift, right?

181
00:08:26.92 --> 00:08:31.16
You know, so they get home at 4 o'clock in the morning.

182
00:08:31.16 --> 00:08:36.36
And, but I think we both know.

183
00:08:36.36 --> 00:08:40.48
I think we both know what the difference is.

184
00:08:40.48 --> 00:08:45.40
And, and I truly think, you know, that waking up early.

185
00:08:45.40 --> 00:08:50.88
Now, if that early means noon because you, you work until 7 o'clock in the morning or

186
00:08:50.88 --> 00:08:56.32
8 o'clock in the morning and it takes discipline to get out of bed, then I believe that

187
00:08:56.32 --> 00:08:58.80
there's, then that's fine.

188
00:08:58.80 --> 00:09:04.56
But if you wake up whenever you want and you slept for 10 hours and you're lazy

189
00:09:04.56 --> 00:09:07.56
getting out of bed, I think that affects your whole life in a negative way.

190
00:09:07.56 --> 00:09:08.56
I really do.

191
00:09:08.56 --> 00:09:11.44
I think it's not good.

192
00:09:11.44 --> 00:09:15.08
And again, I know that some people are on those schedules.

193
00:09:15.08 --> 00:09:17.08
And I know that some people need more sleep.

194
00:09:17.08 --> 00:09:19.44
That's, that's, I understand that.

195
00:09:19.44 --> 00:09:21.08
There's some genetics involved.

196
00:09:21.08 --> 00:09:25.84
I have one of my daughters genetically.

197
00:09:25.84 --> 00:09:29.32
I will go to bed at 11 o'clock at night.

198
00:09:29.32 --> 00:09:30.72
She's still awake.

199
00:09:30.72 --> 00:09:32.60
I wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning.

200
00:09:32.60 --> 00:09:33.60
She's awake.

201
00:09:33.60 --> 00:09:37.08
So there's some genetic weirdness going on there.

202
00:09:37.08 --> 00:09:39.08
Yeah.

203
00:09:39.08 --> 00:09:45.04
What, as far as getting up early, let's say, well, how you said, okay,

204
00:09:45.04 --> 00:09:46.84
it takes discipline to get out of bed.

205
00:09:46.84 --> 00:09:51.32
Wouldn't that kind of indicate that maybe you need some more sleep?

206
00:09:51.32 --> 00:09:56.20
Because let's think of like what they know, what they call the natural sleep cycle.

207
00:09:56.20 --> 00:09:57.88
You go to sleep.

208
00:09:57.88 --> 00:09:59.52
You sleep your however 7.

209
00:09:59.52 --> 00:10:03.20
I think ideal 7 and a half or something like that.

210
00:10:03.20 --> 00:10:05.88
And you naturally wake up.

211
00:10:05.88 --> 00:10:06.68
You got your S.

212
00:10:06.68 --> 00:10:09.40
But if you, if you got a drag yourself out of bed, doesn't that kind of indicate you need more

213
00:10:09.40 --> 00:10:10.40
rest?

214
00:10:10.40 --> 00:10:11.40
Possibly.

215
00:10:11.40 --> 00:10:15.32
But you could be right.

216
00:10:15.32 --> 00:10:18.20
But you know how you always say like, what do you say?

217
00:10:18.20 --> 00:10:19.20
Psychological victories?

218
00:10:19.20 --> 00:10:20.20
Psychological victories.

219
00:10:20.20 --> 00:10:21.20
Right.

220
00:10:21.20 --> 00:10:25.64
So isn't that kind of, it's a mental exercise, right?

221
00:10:25.64 --> 00:10:26.64
Yes.

222
00:10:26.64 --> 00:10:32.32
So you're, if that's part of your routine to fight adversity, you end up getting better

223
00:10:32.32 --> 00:10:39.08
at fighting adversity, whether it's that tiredness you feel or actual physical pain or

224
00:10:39.08 --> 00:10:40.08
you know.

225
00:10:40.08 --> 00:10:45.96
So you sleep, like if you decide to sleep more, it's because it feels good, right?

226
00:10:45.96 --> 00:10:49.20
So right, then it's good for you.

227
00:10:49.20 --> 00:10:53.16
But what if you want more candy?

228
00:10:53.16 --> 00:10:56.48
You know, if you want more candy because it tastes good, but that doesn't necessarily mean

229
00:10:56.48 --> 00:10:57.48
it's good.

230
00:10:57.48 --> 00:10:59.32
In fact, it's not good.

231
00:10:59.32 --> 00:11:03.44
But I do think that there's times that I do definitely need more sleep.

232
00:11:03.44 --> 00:11:05.84
And, but I don't.

233
00:11:05.84 --> 00:11:07.20
And I also know that there's a fine line.

234
00:11:07.20 --> 00:11:09.56
I know when I get, I know when I get over-trained.

235
00:11:09.56 --> 00:11:13.80
I know when I get not enough sleep and I feel it.

236
00:11:13.80 --> 00:11:19.04
And my workout starts going backward and my, GG2 starts going backwards and my life starts

237
00:11:19.04 --> 00:11:21.16
going a little bit backwards.

238
00:11:21.16 --> 00:11:26.64
And then I know, okay, you know, you, you need to, you need to take a day, you need to relax,

239
00:11:26.64 --> 00:11:27.64
sleep more.

240
00:11:27.64 --> 00:11:29.36
Maybe like wake up at like five.

241
00:11:29.36 --> 00:11:32.04
Yeah, a sleep into like five thirty.

242
00:11:32.04 --> 00:11:35.52
And you can always tell that when we were training fighters from the UFC, you could tell

243
00:11:35.52 --> 00:11:39.32
when they, when they reached their limit, when they were over-training, it was so

244
00:11:39.32 --> 00:11:45.000
obvious that we just fall apart on the mat, just completely fall apart.

245
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.84
And you know, the other thing is, I, I'm like making a big deal out of waking up early.

246
00:11:50.84 --> 00:11:55.48
There's millions of people in the world that, that's what their job is.

247
00:11:55.48 --> 00:11:59.32
They're a single mom and they got to work two jobs and they're getting up at earlier

248
00:11:59.32 --> 00:12:01.92
than I am and they're going to bed later than I am because they're supporting their

249
00:12:01.92 --> 00:12:02.92
family.

250
00:12:02.92 --> 00:12:06.40
So I'm not sitting here saying this is the be all end all.

251
00:12:06.40 --> 00:12:11.36
But I will say that it definitely, it definitely has an impact and it definitely affects

252
00:12:11.36 --> 00:12:15.60
the other things in your life if you have that discipline early in the morning.

253
00:12:15.60 --> 00:12:18.32
It, it will help you across the board.

254
00:12:18.32 --> 00:12:19.32
Yeah.

255
00:12:19.32 --> 00:12:23.76
And I, I'd always read this stuff about creative people.

256
00:12:23.76 --> 00:12:28.16
And this is a complete generalization, but they say that creative people tend to stay

257
00:12:28.16 --> 00:12:29.52
up later.

258
00:12:29.52 --> 00:12:34.48
And, you know, usually when you stay up later, you wake up later, whatever.

259
00:12:34.48 --> 00:12:39.96
It's so, if you're mentally weak, yeah.

260
00:12:39.96 --> 00:12:47.84
So couldn't it be kind of seen, couldn't it be seen like when my early waking is a total

261
00:12:47.84 --> 00:12:48.60
lack of creativity?

262
00:12:48.60 --> 00:12:57.20
No, it seems like here you're driven to get things done, you know, get the job done, get

263
00:12:57.20 --> 00:13:04.20
the job done well, no excuses, right?

264
00:13:04.20 --> 00:13:07.60
And at the same time develop your physical mental toughness and improve yourself in these

265
00:13:07.60 --> 00:13:14.08
ways that it's essentially like, I don't want to say the chores in life, but it's like

266
00:13:14.08 --> 00:13:18.88
you, you, you, you want to get up and maximize the day and get the most work done possible,

267
00:13:18.88 --> 00:13:19.88
right?

268
00:13:19.88 --> 00:13:24.24
So if you, let's say okay, I typically, let's say I wake up at 8 a.m.

269
00:13:24.24 --> 00:13:32.16
I do my work, I get home at 5 and I, you know, I kind of goof off, watch some TV and maybe,

270
00:13:32.16 --> 00:13:36.32
I don't know, maybe even go out to a bar or something like that, where all the work is

271
00:13:36.32 --> 00:13:38.96
done, there's no work to be done really.

272
00:13:38.96 --> 00:13:43.28
This far is just kind of in a general way of saying it, there's no work to be done at

273
00:13:43.28 --> 00:13:47.68
the bar, there's no work to be done watching TV or whatever.

274
00:13:47.68 --> 00:13:53.44
So a person that lacks discipline, they're going to, it's pleasurable, the bars pleasurable,

275
00:13:53.44 --> 00:13:57.92
you know, for, you know, generally speaking, TV's pleasurable, so they're going to be all focused

276
00:13:57.92 --> 00:14:02.80
on that, like, I don't want to go to bed and face the work day the next day.

277
00:14:02.80 --> 00:14:04.08
I don't want to charge the work day.

278
00:14:04.08 --> 00:14:07.84
I want to immerse myself in the fun part of it, in the candy part of it.

279
00:14:08.80 --> 00:14:12.80
Then they wind up going to bed late and then they wind up having to drag them

280
00:14:12.80 --> 00:14:15.44
self out of bed, maybe sleeping a little bit more.

281
00:14:15.44 --> 00:14:18.72
So wouldn't kind of that discipline that you talk about,

282
00:14:18.72 --> 00:14:21.20
that applies to the whole day, not just waking up early, right?

283
00:14:21.20 --> 00:14:26.96
So it's like a whole system. So a lot of people, like, you, that that I've noticed,

284
00:14:28.08 --> 00:14:33.44
you focus really hard on getting stuff done. And if you maximize the time you have to get it done,

285
00:14:33.44 --> 00:14:36.80
when you wake up early, then you can do that, effectively.

286
00:14:36.80 --> 00:14:41.12
And at the same time, I don't want to give the impression that I'm living this, like,

287
00:14:41.12 --> 00:14:47.44
task driven life where I have every minute of the day scheduled, because then that does inhibit

288
00:14:47.44 --> 00:14:55.12
your ability to do other things. You inhibit your creativity, obviously. But, you know, I'll

289
00:14:56.08 --> 00:15:02.72
train you, Jitsu. And I'm going to go there for maybe I'll just go there for 45 minutes and get

290
00:15:02.72 --> 00:15:07.60
some rounds in. Maybe I'll be there for three hours. And I don't necessarily know that when I show up,

291
00:15:07.60 --> 00:15:12.32
because I have some flexibility in what I'm going to do in the day. The waves are good,

292
00:15:12.32 --> 00:15:20.32
may I go surfing, you know, but you're right that you have to be disciplined. It's not getting out

293
00:15:20.32 --> 00:15:26.40
of bed is like the foundation of the discipline. And I think it carries over everything else,

294
00:15:26.40 --> 00:15:30.40
because we get out of bed early. And then you work out. When you get done working out,

295
00:15:30.40 --> 00:15:34.32
me personally, I don't want to eat junk when I get done working out. I'm like, oh, you know,

296
00:15:34.32 --> 00:15:38.000
I did a good workout. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling healthy. Instead of eating a bowl of lucky

297
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.72
charms, I'm going to eat, you know, some eggs and bacon and something good. So I agree with you on that.

298
00:15:47.68 --> 00:15:57.76
Yeah. So, um, fear is kind of a little side note to that question. Well, to me,

299
00:16:00.08 --> 00:16:05.52
one of the things people ask me like, what drives you, which is kind of a weird question,

300
00:16:05.52 --> 00:16:10.40
because it's a big question. I guess that's not a weird question. It's a big question. What drives

301
00:16:10.40 --> 00:16:14.96
you like a long list of answers on the one. But one of the things that I definitely

302
00:16:16.96 --> 00:16:25.84
think of as a driver of me is fear. And it's, you know, fear of failure, fear of being a

303
00:16:25.84 --> 00:16:32.72
detective. Yes. Yes. What drives me. But and this comes from, I remember being in the

304
00:16:32.72 --> 00:16:39.28
SEAL teams. I was when I was a young guy in the SEAL teams. I was very afraid of making mistakes

305
00:16:39.28 --> 00:16:44.40
and looking stupid or doing dumb things and getting a bad reputation. And that fear got me to

306
00:16:44.40 --> 00:16:50.16
work early and got me to inspect my gear three more times and got my me to ask my buddy to inspect

307
00:16:50.16 --> 00:16:55.84
my gear to make sure we were good to go. So I think that's what the fear is. And then there's also

308
00:16:55.84 --> 00:17:02.40
the fear of what the enemies doing. And how hard are they training? And are you training harder than them?

309
00:17:02.40 --> 00:17:07.12
And now that I'm in the civilian world, I'm thinking, okay, what is, what is, you know,

310
00:17:07.12 --> 00:17:14.72
some other company doing better than we're doing? And how can we overtake them? You know? And that's

311
00:17:14.72 --> 00:17:20.32
some weird fear and competitiveness that, you know, everybody has. Some people more than others.

312
00:17:21.52 --> 00:17:27.04
You got a balance it for sure. But it's definitely one of those things. Yeah. Yeah,

313
00:17:27.04 --> 00:17:32.16
sometimes that can get in the way, especially when you mentioned like, what is that other company

314
00:17:32.16 --> 00:17:38.88
doing? So I knew this guy that my brother worked with that he would be one of those guys where

315
00:17:39.76 --> 00:17:44.000
he'd be really concerned on what's the, what's the competition doing? So he'd be developing this

316
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.56
aspect of his company and it's like right in the middle of development. Yeah. And

317
00:17:48.56 --> 00:17:51.76
but he'd be paying the tail. You know, one air would be on the, you know, what's going on with this other

318
00:17:51.76 --> 00:17:56.72
company? And they'd do some new thing or go in some new direction that really yields a lot of success

319
00:17:56.72 --> 00:18:01.68
for. And we got to do that. We got to, meanwhile, these other ideas that are solid, viable ideas are

320
00:18:01.68 --> 00:18:06.48
left half developed or the resources are kind of allocated to do this new thing and not so much

321
00:18:06.48 --> 00:18:11.04
the old stuff. And you know what, I actually got asked is working with a company the other day and they said,

322
00:18:11.04 --> 00:18:15.04
you know, how much will we be focused? Because I said something along these lines. This is,

323
00:18:15.04 --> 00:18:20.88
how much will we be focused on what the enemy, on what the competitors are doing? And should we be

324
00:18:20.88 --> 00:18:28.64
afraid of them? And I said, actually fear is the wrong word. You shouldn't be afraid of the enemy,

325
00:18:28.64 --> 00:18:34.80
but you have to respect them. And I think that's the thing that gets me out of that in the early

326
00:18:34.80 --> 00:18:40.88
in the morning is that I respect the enemy. I'm out of freedom, but I respect them and I'm going

327
00:18:40.88 --> 00:18:45.52
to be ready to do battle with them when it's time comes. You know, this is kind of a side note,

328
00:18:45.52 --> 00:18:51.28
but isn't, don't you kind of think too sometimes where it's, you're almost like reflecting yourself.

329
00:18:51.28 --> 00:18:56.16
When you say you're, you're, you respect and you, for lack of a vector, fear the enemy,

330
00:18:56.16 --> 00:19:00.32
what they're doing to prepare, because you know what you're doing to prepare, and it's pretty hard.

331
00:19:00.32 --> 00:19:05.04
So you kind of almost in the back of your mind is thinking they're probably doing all this too.

332
00:19:05.04 --> 00:19:09.28
You know? So it's like the more you do, the more you kind of inableared some kind of just way

333
00:19:09.28 --> 00:19:13.68
might think they're doing the same thing, you know? So it's like boom boom, this never ending

334
00:19:13.68 --> 00:19:17.92
like, it's in your arms race. Yeah. It's a arms race. Yeah. It's a arms race, someone. Yeah.

335
00:19:17.92 --> 00:19:22.80
And if you get caught up in it to a point like the example you just gave you, I can drive you crazy.

336
00:19:22.80 --> 00:19:27.36
And you know, it'll drive you to failure. You know, you have to be able to stand on your own and

337
00:19:27.36 --> 00:19:30.64
and say, okay, we're going to, we're going to maneuver regardless of what the enemy is doing.

338
00:19:30.64 --> 00:19:34.32
We're going to make our, we're going to make our moves. Yeah.

339
00:19:37.44 --> 00:19:40.48
Next, what do we got next? Next question.

340
00:19:41.84 --> 00:19:47.20
Oh, actually there's a, life, you know, and other people, single one. Yeah, I kind of,

341
00:19:47.20 --> 00:19:53.28
I kind of went through that. Yeah, as this, this applies to everyone. So under like concept.

342
00:19:55.36 --> 00:20:01.28
Okay. Well, then, and you kind of talked about this before mental toughness. How do you, and

343
00:20:02.08 --> 00:20:08.48
this is an unknown that applies to me where, certain, you see it even in high levels, certain people,

344
00:20:08.96 --> 00:20:15.68
it's almost like they've navigated their way through life and two into success, not really

345
00:20:15.68 --> 00:20:21.20
needing that much mental toughness because maybe they had some special attribute that allowed them

346
00:20:21.20 --> 00:20:25.68
to be successful early on and kept them succeed. You know, like these athletes were in the most

347
00:20:25.68 --> 00:20:31.52
center of the reality. Yeah. And, you know, and you, you kind of noticed it when things get rough

348
00:20:31.52 --> 00:20:38.72
for them, that's when they break or whatever. And so, I mean, I'm not saying I'm like a superior athlete

349
00:20:38.72 --> 00:20:42.72
or nothing like that, but it just so happens in a lot of ways, some ways, whatever.

350
00:20:42.72 --> 00:20:53.12
Um, I managed to avoid developing mental toughness up until about maybe two years ago. Maybe.

351
00:20:55.28 --> 00:21:03.28
But, and I, of course, I know how mine came about. I think, I mean, the main reason was just

352
00:21:03.28 --> 00:21:09.28
through maturity and seen it around me, but let's say I didn't, I wasn't surrounded by people

353
00:21:09.28 --> 00:21:14.96
who are mentally tough and they didn't see the value firsthand. How do you just develop mental

354
00:21:14.96 --> 00:21:20.000
toughness? Again, this is one of those things that people ask and this was a big question from

355
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.32
online. You know, tons and tons of people asked how do you develop mental toughness? How do you

356
00:21:26.32 --> 00:21:31.76
become more mentally tough? And, you know, you and I did that video on it, or it's like, if you

357
00:21:31.76 --> 00:21:41.44
want to be more mentally tough, then be tougher. You know, and, and you get these people that are out there

358
00:21:41.44 --> 00:21:47.92
that sell courses on developing mental toughness and, you know, they're either going to bring you

359
00:21:47.92 --> 00:21:54.32
into a room and get you into some spiritual state and say, okay, listen, you've got to visualize

360
00:21:54.32 --> 00:22:02.96
the mind of the wolf and you are going to see it through the eyes of the wolf. What does a wolf do?

361
00:22:02.96 --> 00:22:07.84
The wolf does not back down. He leads the pack. And they're, I call this stuff, right? Okay,

362
00:22:07.84 --> 00:22:14.88
I'm not, I don't know, you know, and not, not my gig right there, because because the cool thing

363
00:22:14.88 --> 00:22:19.84
about mental toughness is, is it's just a simple choice that you have to make? Are you going to

364
00:22:19.84 --> 00:22:23.84
go through this thing that's hard, this thing that's tough, this thing that sucks, are you going to

365
00:22:23.84 --> 00:22:28.96
suffer through it, or are you going to quit? It's really easy. You, you just go, okay, I'm going to

366
00:22:28.96 --> 00:22:32.88
suffer through it. I'm going to deal with it. Then you're mentally tough. Done. Next question. Let's move

367
00:22:32.88 --> 00:22:38.32
on to something more important. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't that, and maybe I'm wrong

368
00:22:38.32 --> 00:22:43.20
here, but that sounds like the answer coming from someone who has, doesn't sound crazy, but has

369
00:22:43.20 --> 00:22:48.40
the luxury of being mentally tough. So, if when you're, do you ever remember time that you were

370
00:22:48.40 --> 00:23:00.32
not that you were straight up mentally weak? Do you ever remember any time? No. 1996, I was, now I'm just kidding.

371
00:23:03.52 --> 00:23:08.56
You know, like, I'll tell you people talk about in-seal training. They say, oh, everybody,

372
00:23:08.56 --> 00:23:14.72
everybody wants to quit at some point during seal training, and I literally, not at all, never

373
00:23:14.72 --> 00:23:18.48
from one second, do I think I'm going to quit? I don't want to do this anymore. Not even a chance.

374
00:23:18.48 --> 00:23:25.36
That's ridiculous. Who says that? Seal said, yeah, absolutely. You know, everyone thinks about

375
00:23:25.36 --> 00:23:30.24
quitting sometime. No, and I got plenty of bros and the seal teams that never thought about quitting.

376
00:23:30.24 --> 00:23:35.28
Yeah, I'm telling my best friends. Yeah. They said, no, you don't even think about quitting. Yeah.

377
00:23:35.28 --> 00:23:40.88
And so those guys are mentally tough. And, okay, so if you're not mentally tough, if you view

378
00:23:40.88 --> 00:23:46.64
yourself as mentally weak, then you got to do things, I guess, push yourself to that threshold,

379
00:23:47.20 --> 00:23:50.96
and how do you push yourself to that threshold? You do mentally challenging things. You do

380
00:23:50.96 --> 00:23:56.64
physically challenging things, and you push through them. Yeah. And then that might develop your

381
00:23:56.64 --> 00:24:03.84
mental toughness more. Right. Yeah, you think that, like, any exercise, getting the reps, you need

382
00:24:03.84 --> 00:24:10.000
to get those reps of hard stuff mentally. Like, that's something I analogy you just made. That's not.

383
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.92
That doesn't seem like that would ever work. No matter if you're visualizing yourself as a wolf or

384
00:24:15.92 --> 00:24:21.60
whatever, you're not even getting the reps. That's like saying, oh, I've never played basketball

385
00:24:21.60 --> 00:24:24.56
ever. I've never been held a basketball, but guess what, we're going to get you. We're going to

386
00:24:24.56 --> 00:24:29.12
prepare you to be good at basketball, close your eyes, visualize play basketball, and that's your reps.

387
00:24:29.12 --> 00:24:34.08
Yeah. So, it probably won't work. So, back to the fear thing. We're going to be hammered because

388
00:24:34.08 --> 00:24:38.56
all these people can be like, no, if you visualize you get better. That's true. Right. You're not

389
00:24:38.56 --> 00:24:42.24
in mental strength, but mental toughness. You're right. You're my fear. That's more of a motion

390
00:24:42.24 --> 00:24:48.000
thing. Right. You visualize, you know, winning and reacting and so mental toughness, maybe,

391
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.04
but it won't substitute reps. Like, if you're scared of something, for example, that should be

392
00:24:53.04 --> 00:24:57.20
like a flag. We're an indicator that, okay, I got it. Let's get some reps right here. I'm

393
00:24:57.20 --> 00:25:01.76
scared of this. You're right. And that being said, like you talking about your body, your

394
00:25:01.76 --> 00:25:07.04
seal buddies, that never we're going to quit, right? And I was definitely never going to quit.

395
00:25:07.04 --> 00:25:13.28
Well, I didn't have any reps going into that of, you know, mentally challenging things or whatever.

396
00:25:13.28 --> 00:25:20.72
I mean, what did in life, in life, but this is why I say that. I'm not, I obviously wasn't in

397
00:25:20.72 --> 00:25:29.52
the seal team, so they might find that hard to believe. No, these guys both played football,

398
00:25:29.52 --> 00:25:38.40
do you want school? They both, one of them's father was a Navy seal and just growing up a certain

399
00:25:38.40 --> 00:25:43.84
way with a certain environment does make you tell, like, let's say your father, just not letting

400
00:25:43.84 --> 00:25:50.08
you quit. Like, you play at least even about Warner football. And your dad's like, no, you, you can't

401
00:25:50.08 --> 00:25:55.12
quit. Like, I want to quit this is lame. I'm not good. Or if I'm so just so tired of my hurt or whatever,

402
00:25:55.12 --> 00:25:58.08
and your dad's saying, no, you don't quit and it just is in your mind. And this is the

403
00:25:58.08 --> 00:26:05.68
crazy thing about the seal teams is there's kids that grew up in, you know, some rich town with

404
00:26:05.68 --> 00:26:10.72
very wealthy parents and went to an Ivy League school and they're tough and there's kids that

405
00:26:10.72 --> 00:26:17.52
grew up with no dad and, you know, a single mom and their their toughest hell. So that theory is

406
00:26:17.52 --> 00:26:22.24
almost debunked because where does that mental toughness come from? It becomes from a bunch of

407
00:26:22.24 --> 00:26:28.08
different places that just is interpreted and kind of internalized in the same way. And I'll tell

408
00:26:28.08 --> 00:26:33.04
you where I think it comes from. I think it comes from when a when a human being decides that they're

409
00:26:33.04 --> 00:26:36.80
going to achieve their goals and they're going to go through whatever obstacles, then that's where

410
00:26:36.80 --> 00:26:41.12
mental toughness comes from. It is a decision that human beings make to make it happen.

411
00:26:42.08 --> 00:26:49.76
Yeah, yeah, but I think that when you know, like you're doing it right now, you're

412
00:26:49.76 --> 00:26:54.56
shrinking responsibility for mental toughness. That's what you're doing. I'm trying to narrow it down.

413
00:26:54.56 --> 00:26:59.92
You're basically, you're basically saying right now like you didn't, if you weren't developed

414
00:26:59.92 --> 00:27:04.80
away that raised mental toughness and as everyone else has followed, it's your fault you're not tough.

415
00:27:04.80 --> 00:27:11.68
Take me the exact opposite of extreme ownership of my black mental tough for former

416
00:27:11.68 --> 00:27:17.28
and working on it. No, but I think it is a lot of environmental factors. You're like you become tough

417
00:27:17.28 --> 00:27:23.36
because of certain environments. Yeah, I guess I guess we we would need to see what happens with a

418
00:27:23.36 --> 00:27:27.60
people that aren't mentally tough. Because where do they end up they end up in the gutter?

419
00:27:27.60 --> 00:27:32.32
They end up dead. They end up in jail. They end up in bad places because they weren't mentally

420
00:27:32.32 --> 00:27:36.64
tough. They didn't figure it out. They didn't drive through it. And so we don't even know who those

421
00:27:36.64 --> 00:27:44.08
people are. What happened to them? They failed. They didn't make that decision. They didn't decide

422
00:27:44.08 --> 00:27:47.84
that they're going to get out of that bad situation that they're going to push through that scenario.

423
00:27:47.84 --> 00:27:53.92
The guys that you played football with, they drove through that. Those bad situations got there.

424
00:27:53.92 --> 00:28:00.40
No, that's how they did it. They decided to do it. Yeah. Yeah, making that decision, I guess

425
00:28:00.40 --> 00:28:06.96
it's they would have to sort of access a place in their mind where that decision is final.

426
00:28:06.96 --> 00:28:11.28
Because a lot of times people say, yeah, I'm going to do this and that's my dream and

427
00:28:11.28 --> 00:28:16.88
I'm going to be an architect and then when they go to college when the beginner class is

428
00:28:16.88 --> 00:28:22.64
three hours a day for five days, they're, oh, wow. Well, no. That's one thing that the

429
00:28:22.64 --> 00:28:28.16
seal training does very well is gets rid of those people. Because everyone that shows up there

430
00:28:28.16 --> 00:28:33.28
thinks they want to be a seal until you know, to be ex into it. And then you've got half the

431
00:28:33.28 --> 00:28:37.68
guys and then you end up with 20% of the guys. And everyone has that dream when they show up there.

432
00:28:37.68 --> 00:28:44.000
Yeah, but that dream gets crushed. So as a try to imagine yourself, you probably not be able to

433
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.20
do this, but imagine yourself mentally not tough. Okay. I don't even want to say weak, just an average

434
00:28:49.20 --> 00:28:56.72
person, you know, when you get you're doing some push-ups, you hit about 15, you're like,

435
00:28:56.72 --> 00:29:00.96
all you hit 20, you're like, okay, I can't do anymore. So you stop doing the push-ups. Okay.

436
00:29:00.96 --> 00:29:03.44
Not the guy who's going to get those five extra. You're not that guy.

437
00:29:03.44 --> 00:29:13.52
Yeah. Is there an exercise or an approach to just be on the path that at least increase my mental

438
00:29:13.52 --> 00:29:16.96
your mental toughness? Yeah. Like what they're like, keep going.

439
00:29:17.76 --> 00:29:22.80
Yeah, but I don't want to get I can't keep going. Yes, you can. I mean, I can. Yes. Yes, you can.

440
00:29:22.80 --> 00:29:26.16
That's the difference. You can. You just got to sit. Okay.

441
00:29:26.16 --> 00:29:33.52
Okay. I remember I read the small little book. It was called Mind Games. And there was

442
00:29:33.52 --> 00:29:44.88
just one short chapter on, on anger, anger issues. And I never had angry issues or nothing like that,

443
00:29:44.88 --> 00:29:49.20
but I'd like anyone else as young as like, I don't know, 22, 24. You know, I get mad and think

444
00:29:49.20 --> 00:29:52.80
I'm better than certain rules. And when I get caught out on the rules, I'd pitch it, like, you know,

445
00:29:52.80 --> 00:30:02.72
having attitude or whatever. So I read this little chapter and it said, anger issues along with

446
00:30:02.72 --> 00:30:08.000
other things comes from a low self esteem because you're real sensitive and you react, you know,

447
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.88
in this aggressive way or whatever. But the word low self esteem was like a trigger for me. So

448
00:30:13.68 --> 00:30:18.48
having a low self esteem for whatever reason, that was like an embarrassing thing. Yeah. So I, so,

449
00:30:18.48 --> 00:30:23.36
you know, so that could be a little trigger. So you could find little triggers in, let's say,

450
00:30:23.36 --> 00:30:25.92
you know, you're doing push ups and you don't want to do five more. The fact that you

451
00:30:26.96 --> 00:30:30.96
don't want to do the five more, that should be embarrassing to you. Yeah. You know, like, if you

452
00:30:30.96 --> 00:30:35.28
kind of tell yourself that, that'll help you make that decision where I'm not going to

453
00:30:35.28 --> 00:30:41.04
embarrass myself right now. You know, so that fear of embarrassment can get you into the mode to

454
00:30:41.04 --> 00:30:46.64
to want to exercise more mental toughness, you know, any that trigger. And at the end of the day,

455
00:30:46.64 --> 00:30:52.48
when you feel that weakness, it's a choice to make to overcome it. It's not that big of a deal.

456
00:30:52.48 --> 00:30:58.72
You just sock it up and do it. Let's go to the next question.

457
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
What are some key mental and physical steps or patterns to stay on game?

458
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.72
Yes, this is one of those questions that we got a very simple,

459
00:31:18.72 --> 00:31:23.60
just a very similar question to this. What are the five key?

460
00:31:23.60 --> 00:31:26.56
And people want to put numbers on things, especially these days. I think people's

461
00:31:26.56 --> 00:31:30.80
intelligent Spain. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. People want to see a list of, okay, if I do this.

462
00:31:30.80 --> 00:31:35.84
Yeah. And I guess, you know, that's, it sells. Right. What are the five,

463
00:31:35.84 --> 00:31:40.88
in fact, they've done a bunch of articles about life and they, they, they throw like a number on them.

464
00:31:40.88 --> 00:31:47.36
The 12 things, the three things because people want to believe that there's a finite number

465
00:31:47.36 --> 00:31:53.68
of steps to take. And also as far as an article for consumption, it makes you feel mentally

466
00:31:53.68 --> 00:31:57.92
comfortable to know that, okay, it's not this old, it's finite. No, no, no, no, not much. I'm going to read.

467
00:31:57.92 --> 00:32:01.44
I know I'm going to read the 12. You know, and that's what I'm going to eat. You know,

468
00:32:03.20 --> 00:32:06.48
you know, this is going to go back to what we've already been talking about. You know,

469
00:32:06.48 --> 00:32:11.84
for me, waking up early, working out every day, taking ownership of what you're doing and

470
00:32:11.84 --> 00:32:24.64
responsibility of things that are in your life, making sure that you periodically, throughout

471
00:32:24.64 --> 00:32:31.44
the day, throughout the hour, maybe not throughout the minute, but that you detach yourself

472
00:32:31.44 --> 00:32:37.44
from the situation that you're in. You detach yourself from it and you look at yourself and

473
00:32:37.44 --> 00:32:43.20
you assess. And I think that has a huge impact. And you know, I talk about that a lot, that

474
00:32:43.20 --> 00:32:52.64
detachment that it is something that I learned in the seal teams. And I learned it when bad things

475
00:32:52.64 --> 00:32:59.36
were happening. And if you get sucked into those bad things and you're in them mentally, emotionally,

476
00:32:59.36 --> 00:33:05.52
and physically, you can't assess well, because you're in the problem. It's like when you're

477
00:33:05.52 --> 00:33:12.08
watching a horror movie and, you know, they're like voluntarily, you know, oh, there's a noise

478
00:33:12.08 --> 00:33:15.92
down in the basement. Let's go see what it is. Everyone that's watching the movie that detached

479
00:33:15.92 --> 00:33:20.32
from the situation is screaming at the screen. No, don't do it. The people that are there are

480
00:33:20.32 --> 00:33:26.32
are saying, yes, let's go check it out because they're emotionally and physically and mentally

481
00:33:26.32 --> 00:33:33.92
in the situation. So having the ability to detach from the present from being an inside your own

482
00:33:33.92 --> 00:33:38.64
head, being able to detach from that is usually important because it allows you to do a real

483
00:33:38.64 --> 00:33:48.24
assessment of yourself and then finally stay in humble. You can't ever think that you've got

484
00:33:48.24 --> 00:33:52.80
everything figured out. You've got to constantly be saying, you know, what can I do better? What can

485
00:33:52.80 --> 00:33:59.68
I fix? What am I screwing up? And people are going to give you advice and you've got to take it

486
00:33:59.68 --> 00:34:05.92
and listen to it and see if it's good or not, maybe put it to the test. But I think those things,

487
00:34:05.92 --> 00:34:11.76
you know, waking up early, working out, taking ownership of stuff, being able to detach an

488
00:34:11.76 --> 00:34:17.92
assess and stay in humble. Those are those are kind of my main stays if I had to call them out

489
00:34:17.92 --> 00:34:25.44
on the list of five things that make you better. Yeah, the ownership that I don't, I mean, they're

490
00:34:25.44 --> 00:34:30.40
all pretty, you know, these are all challenges for sure. These aren't just easy things to do,

491
00:34:30.96 --> 00:34:37.76
but the ownership, I think that's a big key, like, in your book, what it talks about, the whole theme

492
00:34:37.76 --> 00:34:42.40
of the book, extreme ownership, where any situation when something goes wrong, when it doesn't

493
00:34:42.40 --> 00:34:47.12
go perfectly or you want it to go better. It's so easy, super easy, especially if you're emotionally

494
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.76
charged or whatever. It's so easy to be like, well, that guy didn't do his job or whatever. And a lot

495
00:34:53.76 --> 00:34:59.84
of the cases, it's true. That guy didn't do his job. And then when you do that, you don't even think

496
00:34:59.84 --> 00:35:06.80
about or you don't honestly tell yourself, or think about what you did or what you didn't do,

497
00:35:06.80 --> 00:35:11.04
you know, or what you did wrong, you know, to make that, you know, to what role you played.

498
00:35:11.04 --> 00:35:17.68
And that's why that detachment is critical, because if you don't detach, it's very easy to be in

499
00:35:17.68 --> 00:35:21.44
your own head and say, well, echo screwed up his part, and that's why we failed the mission,

500
00:35:21.44 --> 00:35:27.52
because echo didn't do his job. And now, but as soon as I hear myself saying that, when I'm saying

501
00:35:27.52 --> 00:35:33.60
it, it's okay. When it's coming out of my mouth, right? I see myself saying it, then I know that

502
00:35:33.60 --> 00:35:39.36
I've, yeah, I've gone the wrong way. I know that I've made a mistake. Yeah. And what's interesting

503
00:35:39.36 --> 00:35:44.16
is when you, when you, and it's something you can do right now, you don't have to get trained in it,

504
00:35:44.16 --> 00:35:49.52
you can start practicing taking ownership of everything you possibly can't literally right now.

505
00:35:49.52 --> 00:35:56.40
And what I found and really like about it is that it works not just like with business, it works

506
00:35:56.40 --> 00:36:01.44
with everything, relationships with friends, relationships with your wife, your girlfriend,

507
00:36:01.44 --> 00:36:06.56
her boyfriend, and whatever, all that. It works amazing in all those situations. So it apply this

508
00:36:06.56 --> 00:36:14.000
really kind of like a staple for life. You don't like a way to conduct yourself in life.

509
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.36
Yeah. And that is, that is why that is why that became the title of the book, because that is the

510
00:36:19.36 --> 00:36:26.64
underlying characteristic that helps people in their life. And I mean, that means as a leader,

511
00:36:26.64 --> 00:36:32.32
of course, obviously, in a, in a pressure situation, obviously, in a business, obviously, but you're

512
00:36:32.32 --> 00:36:39.60
right. And it takes transitions across the board to life. And it makes you successful across the board

513
00:36:39.60 --> 00:36:49.44
when you take ownership of everything, no doubt about it. So at age 44, you get out of bed,

514
00:36:49.44 --> 00:36:56.24
bus your ass, like the next mission is around the corner. What drives you? Actually,

515
00:36:56.24 --> 00:37:04.64
you kind of talked about that kind of that fear of the enemy's preparation. Yeah. But what do you, you know,

516
00:37:05.76 --> 00:37:16.16
this is one of those things that when people start talking about war,

517
00:37:16.16 --> 00:37:28.88
and what war does to people? And you know, nowadays we're hearing, and we see more, and we know more

518
00:37:28.88 --> 00:37:42.16
about what war does to people's minds. And obviously, it is, it can have some some extremely

519
00:37:42.16 --> 00:37:50.000
negative impacts on people. And there's a lot of veterans right now that are suffering, that are

520
00:37:50.64 --> 00:38:06.96
having a hard time. And I think for me, when I think about what drives me,

521
00:38:06.96 --> 00:38:20.08
it's an extremely powerful force that's driving me today. And that is that I served with guys,

522
00:38:24.24 --> 00:38:34.16
that sacrifice their lives so that we could be here, so that I could be here,

523
00:38:34.16 --> 00:38:41.92
so that we could have freedom. So that I could have never mind freedom, so that I could be here all

524
00:38:41.92 --> 00:38:56.72
life. And when you think about that, when you think about this gift, this gift that you've been given

525
00:38:56.72 --> 00:39:07.04
to come back to America and be free and have a life and have liberty and be free for the pursuit

526
00:39:07.04 --> 00:39:15.20
of happiness. And you think about that gift. It's the most beautiful thing anyone could ever give you.

527
00:39:16.40 --> 00:39:23.76
It's been given to you. It's been given to me. And I will not squander that gift. And I will make

528
00:39:23.76 --> 00:39:29.44
every day count as I remember those guys that gave that gift to me.

529
00:39:34.56 --> 00:39:43.28
Yeah, funny how like, you know how you kind of get a glimpse of certain people's life and how they

530
00:39:43.28 --> 00:39:50.16
how they behave and how they act what their routine and schedule is. And when you like you just

531
00:39:50.16 --> 00:39:56.000
hearing that and you've said that before and you've even kind of said that to me before and it kind

532
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:05.84
of reminds you how much reminds me how much I'm not doing. You know, if you get free money,

533
00:40:06.88 --> 00:40:13.52
it almost means less than if you earn it. So I think a lot of times when you don't do a lot or

534
00:40:14.56 --> 00:40:19.12
you have been served or something like that, it's almost like free money. And you've been exposed

535
00:40:19.12 --> 00:40:28.80
to earning that money in the real sense. So that's, boom, that's constantly just in your nature now.

536
00:40:28.80 --> 00:40:33.92
And then, you know, other people they do have to be reminded, you know, and I think you know what,

537
00:40:33.92 --> 00:40:43.52
a powerful reminder because every day, and I would say every minute of every day,

538
00:40:43.52 --> 00:41:01.84
I'm thinking about those guys. And that, that's uh, that definitely pushes me and I don't want

539
00:41:01.84 --> 00:41:18.72
to let those guys down. Yeah. So in regards to the military, you know, officers entering

540
00:41:18.72 --> 00:41:27.52
spec ops or other elite scenarios, what advice would you have for them? You know, this is again,

541
00:41:27.52 --> 00:41:33.04
this is one of those questions that's come up. And I get this a lot because a lot of people that

542
00:41:33.04 --> 00:41:38.32
listen to Joe Rogan, a lot of people that listen to Tim Ferris, they're younger folks and they,

543
00:41:39.76 --> 00:41:44.48
they might be stepping into leadership position for the first time. And so we definitely got a lot of

544
00:41:44.48 --> 00:41:49.92
a lot of questions from military guys that are getting promoted, they're going to be promoted into

545
00:41:49.92 --> 00:41:55.04
leadership positions. And we get a lot of younger people that are stepping into the business world and

546
00:41:55.04 --> 00:42:00.24
they're stepping into leadership roles for the first time in those situations. And I think that um,

547
00:42:02.80 --> 00:42:09.36
and I would tell both the special operations folks and the folks in the business world,

548
00:42:09.36 --> 00:42:13.44
the same thing because as if anyone's listening to me at all or heard anything that I say or

549
00:42:13.44 --> 00:42:17.04
read the book, the leadership principles do not change regardless of his in business or

550
00:42:17.04 --> 00:42:22.88
in battle. The leadership principles stay the same. And so if you're new and you're up and coming,

551
00:42:22.88 --> 00:42:27.76
what do you do? How do you step up into that role? Number one, be humble. I know it's a theme.

552
00:42:27.76 --> 00:42:36.000
I sound like a broken record, but you everybody knows everybody's seen that cocky guy that walks in

553
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.20
and thinks they're going to run everything and you just instantly disrespect that person. So how

554
00:42:41.20 --> 00:42:47.68
do you overcome that? You come in and you be humble. You respect people. You respect people. Regardless

555
00:42:47.68 --> 00:42:53.68
of what rank you are, regardless of whether you're making a ton more money than someone else. It doesn't

556
00:42:53.68 --> 00:42:58.000
matter. You treat everybody with respect. You treat them with respect and they're going to respect

557
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:06.32
you. You listen to them. It means so much when when one of your people comes and talks to you

558
00:43:06.32 --> 00:43:12.16
and you sit down and say, okay, let me take some notes on what you're saying. That means so much to them.

559
00:43:12.16 --> 00:43:17.68
And sometimes people forget that. They forget what it means to look up and see the boss man.

560
00:43:17.68 --> 00:43:23.04
And they might blow a guy off or, hey, I don't have time for you right now. You've got to listen to

561
00:43:23.04 --> 00:43:30.64
people because what you're trying to do in a leadership position. And this is a word that

562
00:43:30.64 --> 00:43:39.36
I've only recently become comfortable saying. The word is relationships. You are truly,

563
00:43:39.36 --> 00:43:47.36
that's what that's what businesses. That's what life is. That's what businesses. That's what

564
00:43:47.36 --> 00:43:53.92
combat is. That's how you lead people in combat in business. You have relationships with them.

565
00:43:53.92 --> 00:43:58.24
Lafan, I talk about this all the time. You know, sure, I can give you an order if you're

566
00:43:58.24 --> 00:44:04.72
below me and rank and you might do it some of the time. But you're not going to, the people that

567
00:44:04.72 --> 00:44:08.56
really follow you that you have a relationship with you. Those guys will do anything for you.

568
00:44:08.56 --> 00:44:15.52
The guys that I worked with, the guys that worked for me were my subordinates. They do anything

569
00:44:15.52 --> 00:44:19.52
for me. And you know what? I would do anything for them. I would do anything for those guys.

570
00:44:19.52 --> 00:44:24.56
The guys that were in my task unit, it's guys were awesome. They were awesome guys. And I would do

571
00:44:24.56 --> 00:44:30.08
anything for those guys. I would give them anything. Anything. And they would do the same for me.

572
00:44:30.48 --> 00:44:35.68
Why? Because we had relationship. That was what we had. It wasn't because I would order them to

573
00:44:35.68 --> 00:44:40.48
do something that doesn't work. So you've got to build those relationships and how do you build

574
00:44:40.48 --> 00:44:46.96
relationships? How do you build relationships then? You build relationships by doing those things,

575
00:44:46.96 --> 00:44:53.28
by respecting people, by being humble, by listening. By telling them the truth, by having integrity

576
00:44:53.28 --> 00:45:00.40
and telling people the truth, you can't lie to people. And when I'm lying as a strong word,

577
00:45:00.40 --> 00:45:06.08
because I don't think people are generally lying to each other in regular basis. But people

578
00:45:07.76 --> 00:45:15.12
people use half truths and they chatted things and you can't do that. And people see right through it.

579
00:45:15.12 --> 00:45:18.40
And even if they don't know what the truth is, they know they're not getting the truth.

580
00:45:19.60 --> 00:45:24.88
So, you know, I was always with my guys. Okay, here's what's going on. Here's the problem.

581
00:45:24.88 --> 00:45:28.88
Here's what we screwed up. Here's what we need to do better. Here's the pressure I'm under from

582
00:45:28.88 --> 00:45:34.56
higher headquarters. Here's why I'm under this pressure. I'm not sugar coating it. I'm not trying

583
00:45:34.56 --> 00:45:41.52
to set something up to be different than what the reality is. If I'm getting told to do something

584
00:45:41.52 --> 00:45:46.96
that I don't believe in, okay? Now this is a tough one. If I'm getting told to do something,

585
00:45:46.96 --> 00:45:51.76
I don't believe in. I'm not going to go tell my guys, hey, I don't believe in this and we're going

586
00:45:51.76 --> 00:45:55.92
to do it anyways. No, no, no, no. If I don't believe in it, I got to figure out why we're doing it.

587
00:45:55.92 --> 00:45:59.44
And I'm going to say, okay, boss, I do not understand why we're doing this. I don't see how this

588
00:45:59.44 --> 00:46:03.44
is going to help us win the battle. So, so you need to explain this to me. So, I can explain it to

589
00:46:03.44 --> 00:46:07.84
my guys because I'm not going to go lie to them. I'm also not going to go down there and say, hey,

590
00:46:07.84 --> 00:46:12.80
we're doing this anyways or I'm not going to send people to do things that I don't believe in.

591
00:46:13.84 --> 00:46:18.08
We're all trying to win the war. My boss is trying to win the war. I'm trying to win the war.

592
00:46:18.08 --> 00:46:21.12
My guys are trying to win the war. So my boss is going to tell me do something that doesn't

593
00:46:21.12 --> 00:46:27.28
make sense and doesn't, isn't logical to win the war. So, I should believe in it. And if I don't,

594
00:46:27.28 --> 00:46:34.08
then I should question him. And those are those are the things that allow you to build relationships

595
00:46:34.08 --> 00:46:39.60
and will the topic of the night again ownership. If you take ownership when there's problems

596
00:46:39.60 --> 00:46:45.28
and you get them solved and then when things do go right, you pass that past the reward and the

597
00:46:45.28 --> 00:46:52.64
credit onto your boys, then that also helps you build those relationships. So, that's what I would tell

598
00:46:53.52 --> 00:46:59.44
a new leader in the business world or a card. If I should have said that one's like number one,

599
00:46:59.44 --> 00:47:07.68
or a card. Yeah. Dang, that's another thing that whole answer what you just said applies to.

600
00:47:07.68 --> 00:47:11.92
It's another thing that applies to everything. Even, you say as a leader,

601
00:47:11.92 --> 00:47:21.36
you know, with the chain of command and all your guys that works with your kids, your friends,

602
00:47:21.84 --> 00:47:26.64
or just even in general, like you know at the gym. If you're, I used to work with this guy.

603
00:47:26.64 --> 00:47:32.48
And he was the nicest guy. He was the nicest guy. He'd always have compliments, but

604
00:47:32.96 --> 00:47:37.20
you know the kind of compliments that are kind of too good. Like man, I don't know. Let's say I'm wearing a

605
00:47:37.20 --> 00:47:42.96
new shirt. Man, that shirt is fucking awesome. And then he said, but he... I've never been told that.

606
00:47:44.96 --> 00:47:50.24
You're gonna have to come up with a different album. But he would do that kind of, he would say,

607
00:47:50.24 --> 00:47:53.84
you know, give you compliments, but just overdo it a little bit too much. Just a little bit,

608
00:47:53.84 --> 00:47:58.56
just to step outside of the realm of it being believable. So, the kind of work, he's got man,

609
00:47:58.56 --> 00:48:02.32
that's awesome trick. And then he walked away with everything that nightclub and he'd come back

610
00:48:02.32 --> 00:48:07.44
like me. Man, that is an awesome shirt. You know, it's hard to believe, given what I know about this

611
00:48:07.44 --> 00:48:12.80
person, that you're that into your shirt. Right. Just for you. Exactly. Exactly.

612
00:48:13.60 --> 00:48:18.64
And that would be a thing if there was other indicators. Right. So, it's a whole persona. So,

613
00:48:18.64 --> 00:48:25.12
it takes that, it takes you being consistent and all these things that you're saying are honest and

614
00:48:25.12 --> 00:48:30.48
consistent about it. So, the point of your story is that you didn't build a relationship with

615
00:48:30.48 --> 00:48:33.76
the guy because you didn't trust him. Yes, exactly right. So, you don't win your saying,

616
00:48:33.76 --> 00:48:37.76
tell the truth, you know, if it's bad, you've got to tell the truth, you're not gonna say,

617
00:48:37.76 --> 00:48:43.76
this guy, literally it's almost like he would only want to tell you good news. So, it could be,

618
00:48:44.80 --> 00:48:48.72
like he could, it's almost like he had this feeling like, even if he hated my shirt,

619
00:48:48.72 --> 00:48:53.36
I thought it looked whack or something like that, he would, he would still, oh, that's a,

620
00:48:53.36 --> 00:48:58.80
that's a cool shirt. And you know, this brings me to another point. And that is balance.

621
00:48:58.80 --> 00:49:04.000
And then I talk about balance all the time because all these things have to be balanced. And when

622
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:12.08
you're talking about truth right now, you have to be tactful, you know, being truthful and being honest,

623
00:49:12.08 --> 00:49:19.04
does not give you permission to be a jerk. It doesn't do that. And so, there's a difference between,

624
00:49:19.04 --> 00:49:23.52
you know, oh, I don't like echo shirt. So, I'm gonna say, dude, that's an ugly shirt, right?

625
00:49:23.52 --> 00:49:27.84
And just like in when you're working with, you know, subordinates and they screw something up,

626
00:49:27.84 --> 00:49:33.44
you know, you're, you know, that was a horrible job. You let me down. No, no, okay. Hey,

627
00:49:33.44 --> 00:49:36.48
well, first of all, you want to take ownership of it. Yeah, obviously, they didn't give you good enough guidance.

628
00:49:36.48 --> 00:49:42.96
But the, the point that I'm trying to make is being honest with people, there's people that are

629
00:49:42.96 --> 00:49:47.60
blunt honest leaders and everyone hates them because they're so blunt. They don't have any tact.

630
00:49:48.16 --> 00:49:54.72
They don't, they don't maneuver. They don't use jujitsu. They don't, they don't think and they don't

631
00:49:54.72 --> 00:50:01.04
assess the whole situation. And they think that if, if I tell echo, you know, if I want echo to use

632
00:50:01.04 --> 00:50:07.28
method A and echo's used to using method B, echo might have a personality that if I go up and say,

633
00:50:07.28 --> 00:50:12.08
hey, use method A now, I'm being blunt, I'm being frank. What does echo say to that? Echo's like,

634
00:50:12.08 --> 00:50:16.64
dude, I've been doing this a lot longer than you. I'm not gonna do method A. I'm sticking my method.

635
00:50:16.64 --> 00:50:21.60
That's real. I need to get, you know, so you've got to, you've got to influence people.

636
00:50:21.60 --> 00:50:28.48
You've got to be a chess player, not a checkers player. And so don't confuse being honest with being

637
00:50:28.48 --> 00:50:34.32
blunt and untaxful and adjirc. You have to do jujitsu. And for anyone that's listening that doesn't

638
00:50:34.32 --> 00:50:43.04
do jujitsu, jujitsu is a very nuanced game where you're constantly trying to set things up and shape

639
00:50:43.04 --> 00:50:47.60
the situation. It's not like boxing and boxing. I'm trying to punch you. You're trying to punch me.

640
00:50:47.60 --> 00:50:51.76
And jujitsu, you're trying to maneuver on the other person. You're trying to get better positions on

641
00:50:51.76 --> 00:50:55.28
them. You're trying to flank them and come in from a different direction that they didn't expect.

642
00:50:55.28 --> 00:51:00.56
That's what the art of leadership is. Anyone could go through a list of, hey, here's what you

643
00:51:00.56 --> 00:51:05.68
guys screwed up on the mission. One, two, three, four, five. Fix it. That guy's not going to be

644
00:51:05.68 --> 00:51:10.88
respect as a leader. Even though he's truthful and honest and blunt, it's not going to get him where

645
00:51:10.88 --> 00:51:20.56
he needs to be. There's a whole, another game to play with in. Yeah, and it's dealing with

646
00:51:20.56 --> 00:51:24.80
egos and it's dealing with personalities. That's really what it boils down to. Everyone has different

647
00:51:24.80 --> 00:51:31.76
personalities and learning how to be a craftsman that knows what tools to use with what different

648
00:51:31.76 --> 00:51:43.44
types of wood. That's what being a leader is. Yeah. If leadership was do these next seven things

649
00:51:43.44 --> 00:51:47.44
and you'll be a great leader, I wouldn't have a book and I wouldn't have a business because

650
00:51:47.44 --> 00:51:53.12
everyone would be a great leader. There is an art to it. It is a very difficult thing to do.

651
00:51:53.92 --> 00:51:59.20
It's simple. There are simple steps. You know, be honest. You know, show integrity, take ownership.

652
00:51:59.20 --> 00:52:05.04
There's those simple steps, but at the same time they're incredibly nuanced. That's what makes

653
00:52:05.04 --> 00:52:10.08
it challenging. That's what makes it so rewarding as well. That is absolutely what makes it so rewarding.

654
00:52:19.44 --> 00:52:24.96
People who don't take accountability. Don't take accountability.

655
00:52:24.96 --> 00:52:35.76
Play me in everyone else. How do you deal with people like that? And personally, how do you deal with them?

656
00:52:35.76 --> 00:52:39.76
Because I guess it would be the same way as you would professionally. Personally, it's all the same.

657
00:52:39.76 --> 00:52:44.88
These are the, these are questions that we get asked on a regular basis and we definitely got a lot of

658
00:52:44.88 --> 00:52:51.20
online. How do you deal with people that don't take accountability? How do you deal with leadership

659
00:52:51.20 --> 00:52:58.08
that doesn't get the message that you are communicating? Right? So just so we can both understand

660
00:52:58.08 --> 00:53:02.80
very out of the gate here. Both those questions. What do both those questions do?

661
00:53:05.52 --> 00:53:10.48
What this question? Both these two questions. They have something in common. How do you deal with people?

662
00:53:10.48 --> 00:53:16.32
People that don't take accountability and people that don't get the message that you're communicating?

663
00:53:16.32 --> 00:53:21.36
You're not taking accountability. It's your blaming these people. You're blaming them for not taking

664
00:53:21.36 --> 00:53:25.44
accountability. You're blaming them for not understanding your message. Who's fault is that?

665
00:53:26.08 --> 00:53:31.12
You're on a, if you take an extreme ownership, that's your fault. 100% of the time. So if I'm a leader

666
00:53:31.12 --> 00:53:36.08
and my people aren't taking responsibility for their actions, that's not their fault. It's my fault.

667
00:53:36.08 --> 00:53:40.48
I have not shown them how to lead properly. I haven't shown them how to take accountability.

668
00:53:40.48 --> 00:53:46.56
And how do you do that? Hey, you know, if echo does something wrong, I don't go echo. You screwed this up.

669
00:53:47.76 --> 00:53:52.72
I say echo. This went wrong. It's my fault that I didn't explain it to you well enough.

670
00:53:52.72 --> 00:53:56.88
I'm not going to talk to you, baby. But like, hey, you know, what do we do wrong? How do we not?

671
00:53:56.88 --> 00:54:01.52
How do we, how do we make this happen? You know, you've got to take ownership of it. And that's

672
00:54:01.52 --> 00:54:08.80
what does that make echo do? That makes echo say, oh, you know what? No, it was my fault. You know what I mean?

673
00:54:08.80 --> 00:54:14.32
So both those questions. How do I, how do I solve those problems? I take ownership of them. That's

674
00:54:14.32 --> 00:54:20.56
number one. Number two, what do I do? Because to take ownership of them is in quite enough here,

675
00:54:20.56 --> 00:54:25.60
we need to, we need to be smarter than that. We again, we need to play chess. So what I always try and

676
00:54:25.60 --> 00:54:32.56
do from a leadership perspective is I always try and understand the perspective that other people

677
00:54:32.56 --> 00:54:37.36
have. This kind of goes to detachment. I got to detach from my own head and I got to see it from

678
00:54:37.36 --> 00:54:43.20
their perspective. So I can understand what does it look like from Echoes viewpoint. What does it look like

679
00:54:43.20 --> 00:54:48.56
from my most junior guy that's not doing what I want to do? Why isn't he doing what is he singing

680
00:54:49.44 --> 00:54:54.64
from his perspective? What is it? Okay, my boss doesn't understand what I'm trying to communicate to him.

681
00:54:54.64 --> 00:55:00.64
Guess what? What is his perspective? How do I detach from my own head? See what his perspective is?

682
00:55:00.64 --> 00:55:05.68
Because once I see his perspective, I can adjust it. Right. So it's very important to try and

683
00:55:05.68 --> 00:55:12.88
understand other people's perspectives. And it's usually not that hard. People are often, you know,

684
00:55:12.88 --> 00:55:18.72
pretty easy to read. And as soon as you leave your own head and get into theirs, you'll see how

685
00:55:18.72 --> 00:55:24.80
you can change this scenario and make them understand it better. So those are two big pieces.

686
00:55:26.80 --> 00:55:35.60
Yeah, that's another one that applies to everything. And how you were saying these are simple steps

687
00:55:35.60 --> 00:55:42.08
but simple but not easy. Yeah, come on, man, to get out of your own head and you know,

688
00:55:43.52 --> 00:55:47.92
it's hard. It definitely is challenging. Especially in these pressure situations where

689
00:55:47.92 --> 00:55:54.48
situations where emotions are evolved and you start getting fired up, people are yelling orders,

690
00:55:54.48 --> 00:56:00.96
you know, capital at risk or jobs at risk or lives at risk. It's definitely hard to do that.

691
00:56:00.96 --> 00:56:06.72
And guess what? Those situations where it's hardest to do are the most critical times where you

692
00:56:06.72 --> 00:56:13.20
need to step back, calm down, step outside your own head. Don't see the emotions. Let your

693
00:56:13.20 --> 00:56:18.48
ego go. Understand other people's perspectives. That's when you need to do it the most. Yeah.

694
00:56:19.76 --> 00:56:29.76
Oddly enough. So what would you say is your most difficult day in the military or can you even

695
00:56:29.76 --> 00:56:39.28
single one out? And how did it affect you or shape you or you know, put you forward, you know,

696
00:56:40.88 --> 00:56:50.48
the time I was in the SIL Team for 20 years. And it was awesome. It was, I became

697
00:56:50.48 --> 00:56:57.60
even called a job because it was so fun and surrounded by great guys and even overseas. And I

698
00:56:57.60 --> 00:57:06.88
rack I was having an absolute fantastic time the whole time. The obviously those were the best

699
00:57:06.88 --> 00:57:14.08
days of my life being a combat leader in a combat situation. That's what I wanted to do my

700
00:57:14.08 --> 00:57:18.32
whole life and when I was there, I knew that and those were the best days of my life. And

701
00:57:18.32 --> 00:57:34.24
encompassed inside those great days are obviously the worst days of my life. And no doubt

702
00:57:34.24 --> 00:57:44.40
the worst days of my life were the days when my guys got killed. And Mark Re, first SIL killed an

703
00:57:44.40 --> 00:57:50.96
Iraq, Mikey Montsour, second SIL killed an Iraq who's posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor

704
00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:00.96
for jumping on a grenade to save three of her other teammates. And Ryan Job, who was severely

705
00:58:00.96 --> 00:58:09.60
wounded, blinded in both eyes after he was shot in the face who made it home. And eventually,

706
00:58:09.60 --> 00:58:17.28
after his 22nd surgery to repair the damage that would have done to his head and face, he died as well.

707
00:58:21.20 --> 00:58:34.56
And the day that was the absolute worst was when I came home from deployment. And I didn't have

708
00:58:34.56 --> 00:58:58.80
those guys with me. And I was coming home to my family, to my kids, to my wife, and they weren't.

709
00:59:04.96 --> 00:59:31.28
And how it affected me as far as my military career goes, I truly understood what was

710
00:59:31.28 --> 00:59:46.000
it's stake in combat. And when I took over training out on the west coast, I was obsessed

711
00:59:46.88 --> 00:59:55.12
with making the training as realistic as possible. And getting the guys that were going overseas

712
00:59:55.12 --> 01:00:02.72
to Iraq and Afghanistan, getting them as prepared as they could humanly possibly ever be to be in

713
01:00:02.72 --> 01:00:11.60
these worst case scenarios. And I remember, you know, I remember we'd set up these scenarios that were

714
01:00:12.72 --> 01:00:19.52
very, very difficult. I mean, unbelievably difficult. Like you were going to have massive challenges.

715
01:00:19.52 --> 01:00:27.36
And I remember I'd see a guy like, for instance, in an urban environment and training. I'd see

716
01:00:27.36 --> 01:00:32.40
a guy standing in the middle of the street, you know, like, which you would not want to do if you were

717
01:00:32.40 --> 01:00:38.48
in Ramadi in 2006. And I'd see, and I would get this feeling, I'd get this sick to my stomach feeling

718
01:00:39.60 --> 01:00:44.56
because, like in the back of my mind, I'm waiting for rounds to start hitting the ground and kill

719
01:00:44.56 --> 01:00:53.44
the sky or wound him and I would, you know, get fired up and you know, explain to him, listen,

720
01:00:53.44 --> 01:00:57.44
you can not, you got to move from cover to cover. Don't be standing under the street. There's no cover

721
01:00:57.44 --> 01:01:05.44
fire going on. And that's how it affected me as far as my military career and how it affected

722
01:01:05.44 --> 01:01:10.000
me in my life. You know, I've already told you how it affected me. Those guys, I'm trying to honor

723
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:18.16
them by living the best life I can and taking advantage of the freedom that they bless me with.

724
01:01:26.64 --> 01:01:34.64
So, I'm going to go to the, yeah, another question from online here.

725
01:01:34.64 --> 01:01:40.96
Hmm, how'd you come to know the darkness and how does it motivate you

726
01:01:42.64 --> 01:01:45.44
dealing with it and using the light to win?

727
01:01:48.80 --> 01:01:50.08
Is this a Star Wars question?

728
01:01:52.24 --> 01:01:56.64
Kind of a fun, too, first part, because you're talking about the darkness and the light.

729
01:01:56.64 --> 01:02:07.84
I don't know about it. It's definitely something that I, it's definitely something that I think about,

730
01:02:07.84 --> 01:02:18.16
you know, and the world is in evil place and there's a lot of evil in the world. There's pain,

731
01:02:18.16 --> 01:02:24.56
there's suffering, there's disease, there's evil, there's war. I mean, there's bad things in the world.

732
01:02:24.56 --> 01:02:36.24
Yeah. And sometimes people ignore those things and, you know, we talked about this with Jill

733
01:02:36.24 --> 01:02:42.24
Rogan quite a bit, you know, we can live in a bubble here in America, whether almost is no pain

734
01:02:42.24 --> 01:02:46.32
and there almost is no suffering and there almost is no violence and there almost is no evil.

735
01:02:46.32 --> 01:02:55.60
And for some reason, I've always stepped outside that bubble and looked and seen what the rest of

736
01:02:55.60 --> 01:03:06.48
the world is like. And so I think that's a counter to what a lot of people believe the world is like.

737
01:03:07.84 --> 01:03:11.20
And so for me, that darkness is always present. It's always there.

738
01:03:11.20 --> 01:03:19.76
And at the same time, there is light. And there is people that are incredibly generous

739
01:03:20.32 --> 01:03:32.80
that sacrifice greatly that give everything they have to serve other people. Doctors,

740
01:03:33.52 --> 01:03:40.40
nurses, firefighters, there's all these people, teachers. I mean, there's just people that do all

741
01:03:40.40 --> 01:03:49.68
they can to help other people and, and to do good in the world. And so I think that's what I try and

742
01:03:49.68 --> 01:03:58.88
balance in my mind. And I don't want people to think that I sit around and brood all day about the

743
01:03:58.88 --> 01:04:07.60
darkness, you know, because I don't, you know, I mean, I love that a good time and laughing and,

744
01:04:07.60 --> 01:04:15.20
you know, smile and I want to do that, you know. But I also, in those moments, I'm definitely thinking

745
01:04:15.20 --> 01:04:20.88
that, you know, we're lucky to be here. Yeah, and doesn't that make like, you know, I don't know,

746
01:04:20.88 --> 01:04:24.64
a day where you're just kind of cruising to whatever and, you know, looking for a laugh or whatever,

747
01:04:24.64 --> 01:04:30.96
and hanging with your friends or whatever. Doesn't don't those days seem a lot more enjoyable when you do have

748
01:04:30.96 --> 01:04:38.80
the darkness in mind, you know, where even, I mean, you know, your kids, so let's, I don't know,

749
01:04:38.80 --> 01:04:47.76
your daughter spills the milk and laughs about it. Right. If you know what the rest of the

750
01:04:47.76 --> 01:04:54.16
world is like, that's going to seem almost enjoyable. That's funny. That's cute. You can recognize

751
01:04:54.16 --> 01:04:59.36
you. All the great things about that little moment. It's a lot easier to recognize the great things

752
01:04:59.36 --> 01:05:03.36
about that little. Exactly. If you understand, if you think that, yeah, the world's all hunky

753
01:05:03.36 --> 01:05:07.84
Dorian milk's never supposed to be spilled and, you know, all this stuff and everything's perfect

754
01:05:07.84 --> 01:05:12.64
and sweet and that's kind of your mindset and all they spilled the milk, that's a disruption.

755
01:05:13.44 --> 01:05:17.84
And you're like, yeah, that's your dot, but yeah, that's my dot sure. You know, I see my daughter

756
01:05:17.84 --> 01:05:21.36
every single day, you spilled the milk. That's a disrupt. You know, so it's kind of that, that, that,

757
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:28.48
you know, without hardship, there can be no pleasure kind of contrast that kind of,

758
01:05:28.48 --> 01:05:32.88
it's brought out more, huh? No doubt about it. No doubt about it.

759
01:05:36.08 --> 01:05:41.04
I say everyone's in a while, uh, you'll hear people going, man,

760
01:05:42.16 --> 01:05:46.88
like this country is going like violence or whatever, you know, like going down the

761
01:05:46.88 --> 01:05:52.08
jitter or all this stuff. And you kind, if you think about it and

762
01:05:52.08 --> 01:05:58.24
let's say you're normal day, maybe not you, but probably you too, you're normal day. If you,

763
01:05:58.24 --> 01:06:02.88
let's say you got up, you worked out, you went to the store. Like, let's say, oh, I want to get a

764
01:06:02.88 --> 01:06:08.56
pomegranate, wait, T yet. 70 left. And you go in your sunny and limon, the guy in front of you

765
01:06:08.56 --> 01:06:16.88
gets into a heated argument with a cash, guy, the cashier. And it starts swearing at them and

766
01:06:16.88 --> 01:06:22.40
like, oh, you, I don't like these prices yelling, just yelling at them. And I can use a get out of here

767
01:06:22.40 --> 01:06:27.36
and you know, anything's right, screw this place using profanity, get some card speeds away.

768
01:06:27.36 --> 01:06:33.20
Right. Didn't break any laws, just that happened right in front of you. You, I would, we would probably

769
01:06:33.20 --> 01:06:38.32
remember that for a while. All it was was a yelling mess. It's not it was no violence, no laws being

770
01:06:38.32 --> 01:06:44.08
broken, no, no, no physical, anything. Just the argument between two people and some disrespect.

771
01:06:44.08 --> 01:06:52.96
Some disrespect. Exactly. You remember that. That would, that would be a significant incident

772
01:06:52.96 --> 01:06:58.000
in your day. That's how good the world is or your environment. That's how good this country is.

773
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.24
Yeah. You know, of course, you know, that we're talking about a spectrum here. You go in certain

774
01:07:02.24 --> 01:07:08.24
areas. It's going to be a little worse. But keep in mind, like, in our environment, I know here in San Diego,

775
01:07:08.24 --> 01:07:13.44
that's essentially how it is most of the time. If you see two people, almost get in a fight,

776
01:07:13.44 --> 01:07:20.88
that's a significant event right there. Yeah. So overall would say, there's a lot of light around

777
01:07:20.88 --> 01:07:26.32
here. There's a lot of light. You know, so I think that if you think about, and you've been

778
01:07:26.32 --> 01:07:33.36
exposed to it, so dang, you can really have a, have an accurate perspective. The light is very

779
01:07:34.32 --> 01:07:38.64
noticeable. You know, if you can, if you can constantly have that contrast and know it,

780
01:07:38.64 --> 01:07:47.76
you know, there's no doubt about that. When, when do you see you go get in the way? Like,

781
01:07:49.20 --> 01:07:56.48
when is it most prevalent, do you think it's so prevalent every three? And this is, uh,

782
01:07:57.44 --> 01:08:05.84
when I saw this question, I immediately thought of, um, this guy who's ego just completely got in

783
01:08:05.84 --> 01:08:13.44
the way and he was able to fix it on this particular situation. And it was me. So, so this is actually

784
01:08:13.44 --> 01:08:18.48
a funny story. This guy, so we, uh, we started working with a company and the company,

785
01:08:20.16 --> 01:08:27.84
had a pretty young CEO and he was a super smart guy and he had played football in college,

786
01:08:27.84 --> 01:08:35.12
a suit, you look D1 football player, just a pretty bad ask guy, super smart, super articulate.

787
01:08:36.40 --> 01:08:44.96
And when I met him, I, I like, there was a little tension between him and me. There was a little

788
01:08:44.96 --> 01:08:51.04
something, there was a little tension. And I'm looking at this guy and I'm like, this guy really thinks

789
01:08:51.04 --> 01:08:58.72
he's a bad ass. And, and so we, we go through a meeting and we go through another meeting and

790
01:08:58.72 --> 01:09:04.88
there's just this tension. I'm going, yeah, this guy is definitely, he's got issues. He's got problems,

791
01:09:04.88 --> 01:09:08.56
looking this guy. And I can feel it come from him that he's thinking the same thing.

792
01:09:10.24 --> 01:09:13.28
Are you sure? Are you the thing in the same thing? I'm positive.

793
01:09:13.28 --> 01:09:17.04
Does he look in the mirror again? I'm positive. He's thinking the same thing. I'll tell you how.

794
01:09:17.04 --> 01:09:23.12
How I know that. So as I'm said there, so we actually did, did like a whole like two days with this company.

795
01:09:23.12 --> 01:09:27.60
And then we were coming back. And the next time we came back, I go, what's going to be like,

796
01:09:27.60 --> 01:09:33.28
this one I have this again, this guy, this asshole. I come back and, sure enough,

797
01:09:34.80 --> 01:09:39.84
there it is. I see him and he's like looking at him and he's looking at me and there's tension

798
01:09:39.84 --> 01:09:47.28
and all of a sudden I saw I detached from the situation and I looked at myself and I said,

799
01:09:48.32 --> 01:09:55.20
Jaco, you're an idiot because here I was and what was I thinking? I was jealous of the guy

800
01:09:56.24 --> 01:10:01.44
or, yeah, intimidated or jealous of it. First whatever the word threatened, I was jealous. I think it was

801
01:10:01.44 --> 01:10:06.40
jealous because he was a young guy that had been very successful made a ton of money.

802
01:10:06.40 --> 01:10:12.48
Yeah, we went to a big school and played ball and all that stuff and he had done all this stuff.

803
01:10:14.08 --> 01:10:20.64
And what was he thinking? He was looking at me thinking, oh this guy, he was a seal and he was,

804
01:10:20.64 --> 01:10:25.44
you know, a duet to guy and he's a badass and both of us were basically

805
01:10:26.08 --> 01:10:30.48
envious of the other one in some way and really what it was. I guess envious of the wrong

806
01:10:30.48 --> 01:10:38.40
word, our egos, both of our egos had impacted. And so as soon as I realized that,

807
01:10:39.68 --> 01:10:45.04
I was like bam, I immediately changed my attitude and I was like, and the next opportunity I had,

808
01:10:45.04 --> 01:10:48.72
you know, during a break or something, I was like, you know what? After working with you a couple of days,

809
01:10:49.84 --> 01:10:55.60
you're you're awesome. I said, what you've done is badass to be your age and be dominating

810
01:10:55.60 --> 01:11:02.48
and company like this and have raised it together and built it. That's awesome and made a ton of money.

811
01:11:02.48 --> 01:11:08.48
I love that. That's just badass man. I have nothing but respect for you and what you've done.

812
01:11:08.48 --> 01:11:14.80
And I actually want to learn from you all, I'm here. And immediately it was like a force field

813
01:11:14.80 --> 01:11:20.08
came down and he said to me, you know what? No matter what I've done in my life,

814
01:11:20.08 --> 01:11:27.20
it's never going to be what you've done. And after that we were broke, but I had to recognize

815
01:11:27.20 --> 01:11:33.04
the ego in the situation, mine and his and I just had to disarm it and then it was all gone.

816
01:11:33.68 --> 01:11:41.92
So it's a story about ego, my big ugly ego. And again, ego, you know, ego drives people to

817
01:11:41.92 --> 01:11:48.08
make people want to be successful and it has a lot of positives to it. But it can definitely get in the

818
01:11:48.08 --> 01:11:58.80
way. Yeah. You recognize that story. I mean, you realize like how that happens. Yeah.

819
01:11:58.80 --> 01:12:02.16
Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Fully, especially when you can see,

820
01:12:03.28 --> 01:12:09.04
man, I can't remember the exact words of how they, I forget even where I saw it. But it was

821
01:12:09.04 --> 01:12:19.28
your threatened typically by something along the lines of if someone is like capable or there's

822
01:12:19.28 --> 01:12:24.16
these things that people have to be in your eyes that makes them threatening to you. So what kind of

823
01:12:25.20 --> 01:12:32.48
put real loosely, when you see someone who is essentially you, you're going to feel threatened.

824
01:12:32.48 --> 01:12:36.16
And it doesn't have to be you like they're the same height as you, or the same race as you,

825
01:12:36.16 --> 01:12:41.92
in that act. There's some kind of equivalency that entends you in a lot of that intimidate your ego.

826
01:12:41.92 --> 01:12:46.56
Yeah. So if you get someone who's let's say you're kind of built, like you for example,

827
01:12:46.56 --> 01:12:52.40
if someone's kind of built, boom, that's one thing. If he's around your save, age, it kind of depends

828
01:12:52.40 --> 01:12:57.84
because it can be if there are a functioning able adult, put it that way. I'm so guy.

829
01:12:58.88 --> 01:13:02.56
Kind of your built, boom, boom, boom, boom. Those are all these other things that it's

830
01:13:02.56 --> 01:13:07.44
live like dogs and it's funny to see like it happened like especially at the gym. When someone

831
01:13:07.44 --> 01:13:13.04
a new guy walks in and he's kind of built, watch everyone's eyes go to, you know, like ears pop up.

832
01:13:13.04 --> 01:13:18.96
Yes, fine. And yeah, that goes everywhere. Business world. You know, girls have a bad man.

833
01:13:18.96 --> 01:13:24.08
My experience for a little nissy. I don't know. I don't know what they see other girls. You know?

834
01:13:24.08 --> 01:13:31.44
Yeah. With that that. Yeah. It's funny. Do you want to go, uh, do you want to go over these as well?

835
01:13:31.44 --> 01:13:39.84
You know what? I think I, I think I, from my, coming from myself. Okay. But anyway, where do you

836
01:13:39.84 --> 01:13:49.04
you say? Proceed with your questions. Okay. So, um, conspiracy theories, right? You know,

837
01:13:49.04 --> 01:13:55.76
how, um, you know, people, they'll, they'll go into the, certain conspiracy. Right.

838
01:13:55.76 --> 01:14:03.20
I also, or in 9, 11, the inside job or recently the, um, the San Bernardino shootings like that was,

839
01:14:03.20 --> 01:14:12.80
you know, what they're saying, the government staged it or whatever. Um, do you ever engage

840
01:14:12.80 --> 01:14:18.72
with people about conspiracy theories? I haven't engaged with anyone about conspiracy theories.

841
01:14:20.56 --> 01:14:25.04
So, do you, when you hear like a new, for example, okay, if you're, you're not really on Facebook,

842
01:14:25.04 --> 01:14:35.60
but, um, we'll just say online, you can see people expressing their opinions about the conspiracy

843
01:14:35.60 --> 01:14:45.12
theories that they believe it. Um, and they're really overt us. Let's say, for example, someone

844
01:14:45.12 --> 01:14:54.40
expresses their feelings about a certain conspiracy theory to you. Do you, on what level do you

845
01:14:54.40 --> 01:14:59.68
entertain that? Not very much. Just kind of across the board? Yeah, not very much across the board.

846
01:15:02.16 --> 01:15:13.36
I'm not trying to convert people and make people think things and, um, and, and I'm definitely

847
01:15:13.36 --> 01:15:24.32
not going to expand a bunch of energy diving into things that are, not worth diving

848
01:15:24.32 --> 01:15:35.36
into. Yeah. Um, you know, with conspiracy theories, you can tie anything to anything.

849
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:43.60
If you want to, I mean, any major global occurrence that's happening will be tied into the

850
01:15:43.60 --> 01:15:51.44
rest into some way to craft macaroni and cheese. I mean, there will be a connection to craft

851
01:15:51.44 --> 01:15:56.24
macaroni and cheese if you dig deep enough. There'll be an employee. There'll be a purchase. There'll be a

852
01:15:56.24 --> 01:16:01.12
plant. There'll be a farm. There'll be a, there'll be a sales. There'll be a stock. There'll be some

853
01:16:01.12 --> 01:16:08.72
connection between that and whatever incident that happened on the globe. And if you want to formulate

854
01:16:08.72 --> 01:16:14.32
those and tie those pieces together, you can do it because the world is connected. And when people say,

855
01:16:14.32 --> 01:16:23.76
oh, this corporation was involved in some way with this incident in this war taking place.

856
01:16:24.56 --> 01:16:31.68
You say, well, yes, you know, there are big giant corporations that have huge interests around the

857
01:16:31.68 --> 01:16:36.64
world. And they're going to protect those interests. And that's what the world is made of.

858
01:16:36.64 --> 01:16:43.44
So, I don't do a lot of debating about conspiracy theories. No.

859
01:16:45.92 --> 01:16:50.16
There you go. Somebody sent me a link to like a

860
01:16:51.84 --> 01:16:58.88
video about 9-11 and I clicked on it. And it was something like eight hours long.

861
01:16:58.88 --> 01:17:09.52
The video was eight hours long about, you know, and I just thought, well, okay, you know, again,

862
01:17:09.52 --> 01:17:16.88
if you want to, you can connect anything to anything if you want to. That's the way the global

863
01:17:16.88 --> 01:17:22.48
world is, the global economies. It's the way things are. Did you watch the whole video?

864
01:17:22.48 --> 01:17:26.80
I watched until I saw it's at eight hours.

865
01:17:32.56 --> 01:17:41.60
I know we got some questions. Questions about blood meridian. I think that those

866
01:17:43.04 --> 01:17:50.72
that book, which is obviously a very powerful book, it's, I think we got to save that for the next podcast.

867
01:17:50.72 --> 01:17:59.60
I know we got quite a few questions about Chris Kyle. And, you know, people want to know

868
01:18:00.16 --> 01:18:09.68
if I knew Chris, if I worked with Chris, and the answer is yes, Chris Kyle was the

869
01:18:11.04 --> 01:18:17.76
lead sniper and point man in Charlie Patoon, which was Lave Babbins. He was the the officer

870
01:18:17.76 --> 01:18:24.000
and charge of that Patoon. And that was in Task Unit, Brusher, which I was the commander of. So we absolutely,

871
01:18:25.28 --> 01:18:34.32
you know, knew Chris and worked alongside Chris. Lave was on every mission for all practical

872
01:18:34.32 --> 01:18:44.16
purposes that Chris was on. And, you know, I, you know, Lave and I spoke at Chris's memorial service

873
01:18:44.16 --> 01:18:53.68
in Calboy Stadium. I mean, it's, so yes, we, we know Chris very well. And at some point, we'll,

874
01:18:55.36 --> 01:19:00.40
I'll get Lave on here and we'll, we'll talk about Chris, Tom, and tell some stories about Chris that

875
01:19:01.28 --> 01:19:07.68
would, you know, provide a perspective that may not have been seen in the, the portrayals that

876
01:19:07.68 --> 01:19:13.84
I've been given so far. So I think we, we need to hold off on that one and maybe just do one more question here.

877
01:19:16.08 --> 01:19:19.68
Do you have any friends that aren't,

878
01:19:21.52 --> 01:19:29.36
well, that aren't military and that are not duty to or MMA guy? Yes, I do. I do mostly musicians.

879
01:19:30.24 --> 01:19:35.68
I should say, most of the musicians. Surfers. I got some, I got quite a few friends that are

880
01:19:35.68 --> 01:19:42.40
that surf. I surf and out here in California. And, uh, and I got some friends that play music and,

881
01:19:43.12 --> 01:19:51.28
you know, we, we rock and roll. Yeah, and that's something that I actually forgot. I knew you

882
01:19:51.28 --> 01:19:57.04
thought, I was saying you knew that you surf, but that you played guitar. Yes. Would you like

883
01:19:57.04 --> 01:20:01.84
to put band or something? Yeah, I was in bands by whole life when I was growing up and I was a kid.

884
01:20:01.84 --> 01:20:09.44
Yeah, it's funny, like a lot of successful people or people who, you know, they always have all

885
01:20:09.44 --> 01:20:17.60
these skills. Yeah. And what's interesting is that, like surfing and playing guitar, like that's not

886
01:20:17.60 --> 01:20:23.76
easy, you know, it's not, I mean, I'm not going to, I'm not going to talk about golf, but golf is

887
01:20:23.76 --> 01:20:27.76
seems like, oh, hey, you just go out and play golf and show some people they get good and great,

888
01:20:27.76 --> 01:20:34.16
you know, and it is fun and stuff, but it's not like surfing, you know, and surfing is fun and

889
01:20:34.16 --> 01:20:38.96
maybe I'm really, there's a little bit more of a physical challenge. Yeah, some more of it,

890
01:20:38.96 --> 01:20:45.20
and a challenge and a challenge that it shows when you are good at surfing or not good at

891
01:20:45.20 --> 01:20:50.32
surfing shows, you know, seemingly, I don't know, I guess that's just my opinion, but it's always

892
01:20:50.32 --> 01:20:55.36
interesting, like the play guitar, sure. Yeah, black belt and jeez. What's interesting

893
01:20:55.36 --> 01:21:03.28
is too, and these are some other, like I know some guys that are surfers and musicians and artists,

894
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.64
and I want to bring some of those guys and talk to them because they have different

895
01:21:08.64 --> 01:21:14.56
outlooks on things and how to get good and what kind of discipline it takes and what drives them.

896
01:21:14.56 --> 01:21:18.80
I mean, you know, like you said surfing is challenging, surfing is cold, it's wet, it's dark,

897
01:21:18.80 --> 01:21:24.56
it's sketchy sometimes, and guys that do that their whole life, until they're

898
01:21:24.56 --> 01:21:35.52
seven to your 80 years old, that's pretty awesome. Yeah. We're on, we're at, um, so, so one more.

899
01:21:36.88 --> 01:21:38.88
Okay, yeah, last question, we'll, um,

900
01:21:44.56 --> 01:21:53.20
the time you wake up in the morning and why do you wake up at that time and what do you think about?

901
01:21:53.20 --> 01:22:00.96
Well, we, we talked about what time I wake up in the morning, but I think this last question is

902
01:22:00.96 --> 01:22:08.56
here, what do you think about before you go to bed at night? And, and really to me, I mean,

903
01:22:08.56 --> 01:22:16.16
to kind of close this out is the last question of, what do you tell people or what do I think?

904
01:22:16.16 --> 01:22:22.32
I think is most, is it, is it helpful, kind of lessons learned to close on?

905
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:33.44
And I think one, one conversation I had with one of my, one of my guys, um, who is just a complete,

906
01:22:34.32 --> 01:22:41.12
awesome warrior, named JP and JP, how you doing, brother out there.

907
01:22:41.12 --> 01:22:50.24
Um, when we were going through training to get ready for Iraq and when you're, when you're going

908
01:22:50.24 --> 01:22:54.48
through steel training, you get, you learn, you learn all this information and they teach you all these

909
01:22:54.48 --> 01:23:02.000
things and you layer them on top of your brain and there's layers and layers and layers of these

910
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:11.12
tactics and techniques and procedures and the layers can get so thick that you lose contact with

911
01:23:11.12 --> 01:23:22.24
the ground. And so we were out in training and I was looking at JP who is a stud and it was

912
01:23:22.24 --> 01:23:26.40
one of those situations where we're out in the desert but there's rocks and there's little shrubs and

913
01:23:26.40 --> 01:23:34.24
all that and he was standing up in the wide open because he was staying in the formation of the

914
01:23:34.24 --> 01:23:38.96
patrol, the way that he was taught and the way that he had been indoctrinated is one of those

915
01:23:38.96 --> 01:23:43.76
layers as you're here and you stand here and this is your field of fire and you watch this area

916
01:23:44.72 --> 01:23:51.44
but what he had forgotten was that you're standing in the middle of an open area. Don't stand there,

917
01:23:51.44 --> 01:23:54.48
move to this little rock and then move to this little shrub and then move this little so that

918
01:23:54.48 --> 01:23:58.80
way if a bad guy looks he's not going to see you and if he does see you he starts shooting you

919
01:23:58.80 --> 01:24:07.04
have a place to hide and I said to him I said JP, my brother, he's like, what's up sir? I said hey man

920
01:24:08.16 --> 01:24:13.92
if you were 10 years old right now and we were out playing army out here, would you stand in

921
01:24:13.92 --> 01:24:19.60
the middle of this open trench right here? Would you stand here? And he's like, no,

922
01:24:19.60 --> 01:24:24.16
I said where would you stand? He said I'd go over there to that rock right there and I'd get

923
01:24:24.16 --> 01:24:33.44
behind that and I said so you're 10 year old brain is doing better job moving from cover to cover

924
01:24:33.44 --> 01:24:40.80
then you're 23 year old brain and I said listen you're instincts you know what the right

925
01:24:40.80 --> 01:24:50.56
thing to do is you know what it is do it and he did and it was amazing and and I think that people

926
01:24:51.28 --> 01:25:00.16
you me everyone people listening people that communicate with us you know what the right thing to do is

927
01:25:00.40 --> 01:25:07.60
you know what it is you know it's be disciplined you know it's work hard you know it's put your ego and

928
01:25:07.60 --> 01:25:21.28
check you know these things you just got to do you just got to do I think we're close that

929
01:25:21.28 --> 01:25:27.52
with that yeah so thanks to everybody for joining and we had a bunch of people on the

930
01:25:28.24 --> 01:25:36.40
on periscope that was pretty cool to watch and we'll see how this one goes and we'll do some more

931
01:25:36.40 --> 01:25:44.88
in the near future yeah I like the idea that people are really engaged with you online and

932
01:25:44.88 --> 01:25:51.04
and they'll ask you questions and you'll essentially confirm like check that that's a good

933
01:25:51.04 --> 01:25:57.04
question kind of thing you're engaging I think that's a good thing because these are real questions

934
01:25:57.04 --> 01:26:02.80
it's not like questions and we just thought up no that's a great question so yeah so I would say

935
01:26:02.80 --> 01:26:07.28
to yet encourage that to you know for people if they're wondering about stuff because this is

936
01:26:08.32 --> 01:26:12.80
in my experience everything that you've even said before this and even just stuff you said to me

937
01:26:12.80 --> 01:26:18.48
personally what it's all like it's really useful stuff and not just in business it applied the

938
01:26:18.48 --> 01:26:23.04
concepts I'll play it pretty much everything in life functioning in life if you can function with

939
01:26:23.04 --> 01:26:27.44
these concepts that you're gonna you're gonna do good it'll be kind of on you if you don't

940
01:26:27.44 --> 01:26:35.04
nothing to take that extreme all awesome all right thanks everybody for joining appreciate it we'll talk to you next time out here
