00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.74
This is Jockel Podcasts number 59.

2
00:00:04.74 --> 00:00:08.70
With echo Charles and me, Jockel willing.

3
00:00:08.70 --> 00:00:09.70
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:09.70 --> 00:00:10.70
Good evening.

5
00:00:16.70 --> 00:00:18.90
Their screams are the worst.

6
00:00:20.70 --> 00:00:25.000
We're more than 100 meters away on the other side of the river,

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.50
but I can hear Marines dying.

8
00:00:27.50 --> 00:00:31.50
Their armored vehicle hit a landmine.

9
00:00:33.50 --> 00:00:36.50
It caught fire with 15 men aboard.

10
00:00:39.50 --> 00:00:42.50
They scream as they burn alive.

11
00:00:45.50 --> 00:00:49.50
The radio chatter is desperate, almost hysterical.

12
00:00:53.50 --> 00:00:54.50
Nobody can get to them.

13
00:00:54.50 --> 00:00:58.50
There will be no salvation.

14
00:01:00.50 --> 00:01:03.50
Only a torturous death in the flames.

15
00:01:06.50 --> 00:01:08.50
From our position across the river,

16
00:01:08.50 --> 00:01:12.50
we hear every agonizing moment

17
00:01:12.50 --> 00:01:16.50
and can see their funeral pyre rising over the riverbank.

18
00:01:16.50 --> 00:01:21.50
I can do nothing.

19
00:01:21.50 --> 00:01:25.50
It is the most helpless,

20
00:01:25.50 --> 00:01:29.50
in raging feeling I've ever experienced.

21
00:01:31.50 --> 00:01:35.50
I have no way to get across the water to those burning men.

22
00:01:35.50 --> 00:01:44.50
It takes forever for the last screams to fade away.

23
00:01:54.50 --> 00:02:00.50
And that is an excerpt from a book called Heart For The Fight.

24
00:02:00.50 --> 00:02:06.50
And it's written by a guy named Brian Stan.

25
00:02:06.50 --> 00:02:09.50
And if you don't know who Brian Stan is,

26
00:02:11.50 --> 00:02:13.50
you can Google him.

27
00:02:15.50 --> 00:02:18.50
He's a son, a father, a husband.

28
00:02:19.50 --> 00:02:22.50
He was the WEC light heavyweight champion of the world.

29
00:02:22.50 --> 00:02:24.50
He's a UFC veteran.

30
00:02:26.50 --> 00:02:28.50
11 flights in the UFC.

31
00:02:28.50 --> 00:02:34.50
With some wins and some losses against some of the best fighters in the world.

32
00:02:37.50 --> 00:02:41.50
He's also a veteran of the United States Marine Corps.

33
00:02:42.50 --> 00:02:46.50
With two tours to Iraq as a platoon commander.

34
00:02:47.50 --> 00:02:49.50
And as a company ex-il.

35
00:02:52.50 --> 00:02:57.50
And I am honored tonight to actually have Brian

36
00:02:57.50 --> 00:03:00.50
Stan with us here as a guest.

37
00:03:02.50 --> 00:03:04.50
Mr. Brian Stan.

38
00:03:05.50 --> 00:03:06.50
Welcome to this show.

39
00:03:06.50 --> 00:03:10.50
I gotta tell you that I have not been introduced like that before.

40
00:03:10.50 --> 00:03:14.50
That's an exerted that book that I could honestly say I have laid eyes on.

41
00:03:15.50 --> 00:03:17.50
I don't even know how many years I forget the year.

42
00:03:18.50 --> 00:03:22.50
We released it some powerful writing by my ghostwriter John Bruning.

43
00:03:22.50 --> 00:03:29.50
I think it's a tough memory. It's one of those ones that we kind of buried deep down and think about just from time to time.

44
00:03:30.50 --> 00:03:34.50
But certainly when you at times, maybe you take things for granted in life.

45
00:03:35.50 --> 00:03:37.50
It's good to go back to that moment.

46
00:03:38.50 --> 00:03:45.50
You know, and realize that whatever I may be whining about or whatever I think is difficult at the time is a heck of a lot easier than it once was.

47
00:03:46.50 --> 00:03:47.50
And I need to be grateful.

48
00:03:48.50 --> 00:03:49.50
Get off my button.

49
00:03:49.50 --> 00:04:03.50
Yeah. I think that a lot of people, you know, you see the explosions take place with the IEDs and you know, the wars that we were involved in were, you know, the main weapon of the enemy was the IED.

50
00:04:04.50 --> 00:04:14.50
And even when we made thicker heavier armored vehicles or like track vehicles, when they get hit with an IED, even though it might withstand some of the impact, this fire start and it's a nightmare.

51
00:04:15.50 --> 00:04:17.50
And this is the nightmare you described right there.

52
00:04:17.50 --> 00:04:33.50
And you know, I want to get into that. I want to get into the combat that you experienced. But before we do that, the first of all, like the people that listen to this show, not everyone, even watches UFC, not everyone knows about you.

53
00:04:34.50 --> 00:04:41.50
So just kind of give a little bit of a background on growing up. Let's take it back to scritten.

54
00:04:42.50 --> 00:04:43.50
Absolutely.

55
00:04:43.50 --> 00:04:47.50
So moved around a lot. I was actually, he says, born in Japan.

56
00:04:48.50 --> 00:04:53.50
And around that time when my mom had come back to the states, my father left.

57
00:04:54.50 --> 00:04:57.50
And so group of Northeast Pennsylvania moved around quite a bit.

58
00:04:58.50 --> 00:05:03.50
But got into sports in early age. And I had a phenomenal mom.

59
00:05:03.50 --> 00:05:09.50
And I think not having a dad really affected my sister a lot more than it affected me.

60
00:05:09.50 --> 00:05:17.50
But even from an early age, I knew that the military was going to be an option.

61
00:05:18.50 --> 00:05:23.50
From the days of being a young kid watching silly movies like Iron Eagle, there was something.

62
00:05:24.50 --> 00:05:26.50
There was not called Iron Eagle, silly.

63
00:05:27.50 --> 00:05:30.50
That's like your classic to them.

64
00:05:31.50 --> 00:05:36.50
But for me, there was always something to it that that rang is special to me.

65
00:05:36.50 --> 00:05:44.50
And you know, what I found is growing up without a dad, you tend to want to impress every male influence you have in your life.

66
00:05:45.50 --> 00:05:48.50
So every time I went out for a team, I wanted to be the hardest worker on the team.

67
00:05:49.50 --> 00:05:50.50
I'd run through a wall for my coach.

68
00:05:51.50 --> 00:05:55.50
And that continued all the way through high school and then all of a sudden playing high school football,

69
00:05:56.50 --> 00:05:58.50
I started to get recruited by some good schools.

70
00:05:59.50 --> 00:06:01.50
And not many people in my family had gone to college.

71
00:06:01.50 --> 00:06:06.50
Certainly I'd expected to go to college, but never expected to get recruited to go play somewhere.

72
00:06:07.50 --> 00:06:09.50
So that was a different experience for me.

73
00:06:10.50 --> 00:06:11.50
I didn't always handle it the best.

74
00:06:12.50 --> 00:06:17.50
But when the Naval Academy came knocking, you know, I knew that's where I wanted to go.

75
00:06:18.50 --> 00:06:20.50
West Point started recruiting me early as a junior.

76
00:06:21.50 --> 00:06:23.50
I took my films, my tapes to the Naval Academy.

77
00:06:24.50 --> 00:06:27.50
There was just something about that place and I wanted to go there.

78
00:06:27.50 --> 00:06:31.50
So I decided before I make a decision, let me visit West Point.

79
00:06:32.50 --> 00:06:35.50
Let me visit the Naval Academy in a four day time period. I'll visit both and make my decision.

80
00:06:36.50 --> 00:06:40.50
When I went to West Point, one of the football coaches was supposed to meet me there.

81
00:06:41.50 --> 00:06:41.50
Never showed.

82
00:06:42.50 --> 00:06:45.50
So one of the players took me around campus showed me some stuff, but it was still beautiful.

83
00:06:46.50 --> 00:06:49.50
I mean, greater than any, you know, scritten to one of the poorer cities in America.

84
00:06:50.50 --> 00:06:51.50
It's not nice.

85
00:06:51.50 --> 00:06:56.50
So, you know, my uncles, my aunts and my mom, the thought of me going to the Naval Academy is a big deal.

86
00:06:57.50 --> 00:07:00.50
I remember my track coach and high school tell me, Brian, listen, this is a big deal.

87
00:07:01.50 --> 00:07:04.50
It's a great opportunity. There's a lot of things in your life that can change by going here.

88
00:07:05.50 --> 00:07:07.50
So yeah, but you know, I'm getting recruited by some of these Ivy League schools to eat.

89
00:07:08.50 --> 00:07:10.50
It's not the same and I don't think you're going to fit in.

90
00:07:11.50 --> 00:07:12.50
I honestly'm going to be honest with you, Brian.

91
00:07:13.50 --> 00:07:14.50
My track coaches are bright guy.

92
00:07:15.50 --> 00:07:17.50
So two days later, I go to the Naval Academy and I hand them my tape.

93
00:07:17.50 --> 00:07:21.50
Now, they hadn't even started recruiting me yet, but those coaches were so nice to my mom.

94
00:07:22.50 --> 00:07:27.50
And by doing that, they recruited my mom. They were so respectful to her.

95
00:07:28.50 --> 00:07:30.50
The water was there. So pretty. Okay.

96
00:07:31.50 --> 00:07:37.50
I'm in and I had made that decision early that that's where I wanted to go and focus on that.

97
00:07:38.50 --> 00:07:44.50
Did some summer school to take some classes to boost my AP courses in high school just to make sure they have to go to the prepschool first.

98
00:07:44.50 --> 00:07:57.50
I want to go right through the Naval Academy. And so that in a really quick nutshell, football was a vehicle along with my academics were good, but you know, having a three, five GPA and a 12, 10 and your SATs.

99
00:07:57.50 --> 00:07:59.50
Isn't it normally going to get you into the Naval Academy?

100
00:08:00.50 --> 00:08:02.50
Football was was the vehicle that got me there.

101
00:08:02.50 --> 00:08:07.50
And I could remember prom night lifting weights in the weight room with my rented talks in the locker.

102
00:08:08.50 --> 00:08:10.50
I was there all by myself. I had the security code.

103
00:08:10.50 --> 00:08:16.50
I was, you know, when the only guys who worked all summer long was the only white guy where I worked in this tomato plant.

104
00:08:17.50 --> 00:08:24.50
And I would work to help pay for the high school. I went to my mom took me out of public schooling, put me in this good high school because I got suspended a couple times in middle school.

105
00:08:25.50 --> 00:08:30.50
And it was one of the harder decisions, but one of the best decisions that that she made and pushed me towards.

106
00:08:30.50 --> 00:08:34.50
Because the teachers at that school, when they saw me having this opportunity, they helped.

107
00:08:35.50 --> 00:08:39.50
Hey, let's help Brian get the Naval Academy. Go there to play football, but you know,

108
00:08:39.50 --> 00:08:41.50
really get himself on a great trajectory.

109
00:08:41.50 --> 00:08:44.50
And there, there's not a day or regret it.

110
00:08:44.50 --> 00:08:47.50
There were definitely days I couldn't stand being at the Naval Academy.

111
00:08:47.50 --> 00:08:55.50
Like anybody hated it, but the friends I made there, the opportunities in the pathway to the Marine Corps, which still to this day,

112
00:08:55.50 --> 00:09:01.50
I don't know if I'll ever be as good at any job because I wasn't being a Marine infantry officer.

113
00:09:01.50 --> 00:09:02.50
I just, I don't know that.

114
00:09:02.50 --> 00:09:12.50
And when you got there, you're, they, the type of football that they were playing didn't really match your, because you were a quarterback.

115
00:09:12.50 --> 00:09:13.50
And I was right.

116
00:09:13.50 --> 00:09:18.50
And so in the book, you're saying that your, your type of football didn't really match what they wanted to do.

117
00:09:18.50 --> 00:09:20.50
No, it was a rude awakening for me.

118
00:09:20.50 --> 00:09:23.50
You know, I went there thinking, I'm going to be the next Roger Stover.

119
00:09:23.50 --> 00:09:24.50
And we all did.

120
00:09:24.50 --> 00:09:27.50
And then all of a sudden you start to see all these other kids from all over the country.

121
00:09:27.50 --> 00:09:30.50
Wow, they're good to, I never really run the option before.

122
00:09:30.50 --> 00:09:36.50
And they've got guys from the prep school that already done a year in the system and did that system in high school that can run the option.

123
00:09:36.50 --> 00:09:40.50
So next thing you know, I'm getting moved to wider seabrum, get moved to safety, then I'm getting moved to linebacker.

124
00:09:40.50 --> 00:09:42.50
And I have to figure out how to play these positions.

125
00:09:42.50 --> 00:09:50.50
And it was one of the best lessons I ever learned as a young man, where I had to make a decision, I'm going to contribute to this team.

126
00:09:50.50 --> 00:09:52.50
I'm not going to be a starter.

127
00:09:52.50 --> 00:09:54.50
I'm not going to be a star.

128
00:09:54.50 --> 00:10:02.50
So the best contributions I can make as a leader are to help mentally prepare the younger guys to play.

129
00:10:02.50 --> 00:10:06.50
So my senior year was competing for the starting outside linebacker position.

130
00:10:06.50 --> 00:10:10.50
And we had this young kid named Bobby McLaren, who was an animal.

131
00:10:10.50 --> 00:10:12.50
I mean an animal, but he was uncontrollable.

132
00:10:12.50 --> 00:10:14.50
He could not understand the defense at all.

133
00:10:14.50 --> 00:10:15.50
He's still wild man.

134
00:10:15.50 --> 00:10:18.50
If I'm all around knocking over anything he touched, but he was an idiot.

135
00:10:18.50 --> 00:10:23.50
If a football was an engineering major, really bright kid, but I'm more on football.

136
00:10:23.50 --> 00:10:24.50
All right, so I'm a senior.

137
00:10:24.50 --> 00:10:26.50
I'm going to help this kid out.

138
00:10:26.50 --> 00:10:30.50
And we're in two days, and I'm competing for the starting job, and I'm helping this kid out who's third string.

139
00:10:30.50 --> 00:10:33.50
And he's getting frustrated, and then all of a sudden he starts to get it.

140
00:10:33.50 --> 00:10:35.50
And he's starting to grasp on.

141
00:10:35.50 --> 00:10:41.50
And slowly but surely I could see this kid taking not only my job, but the job of the guy who was ahead of me, who I was competing with.

142
00:10:41.50 --> 00:10:47.50
And you know, the bottom line was, is I had to find a way to contribute value to the team.

143
00:10:47.50 --> 00:10:52.50
Obviously I have a special teams contributor, but leadership was going to be the biggest thing I contributed.

144
00:10:52.50 --> 00:10:57.50
And that made me a very valuable member of the team that season.

145
00:10:57.50 --> 00:11:03.50
And it taught me great lessons moving forward both from the Marine Corps, and especially now in my job.

146
00:11:03.50 --> 00:11:14.50
If you aren't finding a way to add value to your organization to your team every day, then you're wasting time, you're wasting money, and somebody's going to take that spot.

147
00:11:14.50 --> 00:11:16.50
Somebody will come along and take that spot.

148
00:11:16.50 --> 00:11:18.50
I don't care how successful you get.

149
00:11:18.50 --> 00:11:22.50
You can't take life for granted every day you got to add value.

150
00:11:22.50 --> 00:11:27.50
I learned that lesson early in my football coach, my linebacker coach liked me the most.

151
00:11:27.50 --> 00:11:30.50
I was his favorite guy, and he would admit that to me in our personal meetings.

152
00:11:30.50 --> 00:11:33.50
But the end of the day, he told me, Brian, I get paid.

153
00:11:33.50 --> 00:11:38.50
I feed my family to put the best players on the field who are going to help us win games.

154
00:11:38.50 --> 00:11:40.50
I really wish that was you right now.

155
00:11:40.50 --> 00:11:42.50
But it's not.

156
00:11:42.50 --> 00:11:45.50
And those are hard conversations to listen to.

157
00:11:45.50 --> 00:11:51.50
But if you're going to be a leader, you got to be able to receive that information and find a way to get better.

158
00:11:51.50 --> 00:11:57.50
Yeah, you know, speaking of that, so you actually they fired the coach that you had your first three years.

159
00:11:57.50 --> 00:11:59.50
New coach came in, and I'm going to go to the book here.

160
00:11:59.50 --> 00:12:01.50
It's your senior year.

161
00:12:01.50 --> 00:12:07.50
Two days are brutal or deals, detested by every player who is step foot on a football field.

162
00:12:07.50 --> 00:12:14.50
That summer, our new coach Paul Johnson used two days to make a statement.

163
00:12:14.50 --> 00:12:19.50
He made us start practicing before dawn every day at 0, 4, 45.

164
00:12:19.50 --> 00:12:25.50
We reported to the field, and Johnson's new coaching staff beat us half to death with repeated fourth quarter drills.

165
00:12:25.50 --> 00:12:27.50
We ran, we hit.

166
00:12:27.50 --> 00:12:29.50
None of this no contact drilling.

167
00:12:29.50 --> 00:12:31.50
Johnson spared no one.

168
00:12:31.50 --> 00:12:34.50
But mid morning, guys were puking where they stood.

169
00:12:34.50 --> 00:12:36.50
I love this right here.

170
00:12:36.50 --> 00:12:39.50
No wonder why you pussy's went, oh, and 11.

171
00:12:39.50 --> 00:12:42.50
He shouted more than once as we gasped and suffered.

172
00:12:42.50 --> 00:12:45.50
Coach Johnson showed no mercy when he evaluated the team.

173
00:12:45.50 --> 00:12:49.50
He concluded that we lacked discipline and motivation.

174
00:12:49.50 --> 00:12:55.50
He made our two weeks in August a crucible designed to test our toughness and our commitment to the team.

175
00:12:55.50 --> 00:12:58.50
At one point, a wide receiver went down with a phantom injury.

176
00:12:58.50 --> 00:13:03.50
After the team, Dr. examined the wide out and found nothing wrong with him.

177
00:13:03.50 --> 00:13:05.50
Coach Johnson demoted him on the spot.

178
00:13:05.50 --> 00:13:08.50
So Coach Johnson came in and dropped the heat man.

179
00:13:08.50 --> 00:13:11.50
I still remember.

180
00:13:11.50 --> 00:13:15.50
You know, back then at the Naval Academy, we had what was called instant messenger.

181
00:13:15.50 --> 00:13:17.50
And so you could leave in a way message.

182
00:13:17.50 --> 00:13:20.50
You know, on your instant messenger, and we did our fourth quarter drills.

183
00:13:20.50 --> 00:13:23.50
I remember our starting defensive end, Pete Butte Miller.

184
00:13:23.50 --> 00:13:25.50
He left in his a way message.

185
00:13:25.50 --> 00:13:27.50
He said, today I met death.

186
00:13:27.50 --> 00:13:29.50
And death kicked my, you know what?

187
00:13:29.50 --> 00:13:30.50
It was brutal.

188
00:13:30.50 --> 00:13:32.50
And they screamed at us repeatedly.

189
00:13:32.50 --> 00:13:34.50
No wonder you went on 11.

190
00:13:34.50 --> 00:13:36.50
We were a naval academy football team.

191
00:13:36.50 --> 00:13:39.50
And the previous coach had let discipline just run a ride.

192
00:13:39.50 --> 00:13:43.50
You know, both on the field in practice, in the weight room, in films.

193
00:13:43.50 --> 00:13:46.50
You could be hurt all weeks till starting a game.

194
00:13:46.50 --> 00:13:50.50
The things that are essential for a military academy team to win.

195
00:13:50.50 --> 00:13:52.50
I mean, you've got to be in better shape than the other team.

196
00:13:52.50 --> 00:13:54.50
And you've got to commit less mental errors.

197
00:13:54.50 --> 00:13:56.50
Because physically you're never really going to match up.

198
00:13:56.50 --> 00:13:57.50
Right.

199
00:13:57.50 --> 00:13:58.50
And we were making that error.

200
00:13:58.50 --> 00:14:01.50
And from all that chaos,

201
00:14:01.50 --> 00:14:06.50
one of the real amazing things I learned from those coaches,

202
00:14:06.50 --> 00:14:09.50
who that staff is basically still there today.

203
00:14:09.50 --> 00:14:11.50
Coach Nehematolo Lolo was the offensive coordinator.

204
00:14:11.50 --> 00:14:14.50
When Johnson left, he's now the head coach.

205
00:14:14.50 --> 00:14:16.50
But they taught me.

206
00:14:16.50 --> 00:14:20.50
And as leaders to expect excellence, every single drill,

207
00:14:20.50 --> 00:14:24.50
every film session, every weight room session, every conditioning.

208
00:14:24.50 --> 00:14:25.50
There was a standard.

209
00:14:25.50 --> 00:14:28.50
You either meet the standard or you don't meet the standard.

210
00:14:28.50 --> 00:14:30.50
And if you don't meet the standard, there are consequences.

211
00:14:30.50 --> 00:14:32.50
There's remediation.

212
00:14:32.50 --> 00:14:35.50
There's ways that you have to fix it because this is the only thing

213
00:14:35.50 --> 00:14:36.50
that's good enough.

214
00:14:36.50 --> 00:14:38.50
If we're going to move forward, you either get better.

215
00:14:38.50 --> 00:14:41.50
You get worse every day, getting worse is unacceptable.

216
00:14:41.50 --> 00:14:46.50
And when you take that mentality as an officer to what you're doing in the field

217
00:14:46.50 --> 00:14:50.50
to train 160 Marines to go to combat,

218
00:14:50.50 --> 00:14:54.50
all of a sudden, Nehematolo is a lot more serious than when in losing football games.

219
00:14:54.50 --> 00:14:57.50
But that holds true in business and holds true in anything.

220
00:14:57.50 --> 00:14:58.50
There is a standard.

221
00:14:58.50 --> 00:15:02.50
And if you, if you accept below that standard just once,

222
00:15:02.50 --> 00:15:04.50
that sets a precedent.

223
00:15:04.50 --> 00:15:07.50
That could lead to what happened before he got there.

224
00:15:07.50 --> 00:15:10.50
And I've gone back to the Naval Academy repeatedly.

225
00:15:10.50 --> 00:15:11.50
And I've talked to the team.

226
00:15:11.50 --> 00:15:14.50
I actually talked to the junior class every single year.

227
00:15:14.50 --> 00:15:17.50
And one of the things I always tell those coaches,

228
00:15:17.50 --> 00:15:21.50
gentlemen, you guys are putting out a better product

229
00:15:21.50 --> 00:15:24.50
as officers because you're here.

230
00:15:24.50 --> 00:15:26.50
Your job is to put forth the great football team,

231
00:15:26.50 --> 00:15:27.50
but I promise you.

232
00:15:27.50 --> 00:15:30.50
And the staff at the Naval Academy, the officers, they see it too.

233
00:15:30.50 --> 00:15:33.50
They are making better leaders because of what they're doing on the football field.

234
00:15:33.50 --> 00:15:36.50
Before they got there, that wasn't happening.

235
00:15:36.50 --> 00:15:39.50
What was happening on the football field is making us worse officers.

236
00:15:39.50 --> 00:15:41.50
And so I still hold true.

237
00:15:41.50 --> 00:15:44.50
He now coaches Paul Johnson coaches the Georgia Techno.

238
00:15:44.50 --> 00:15:47.50
He brought me down to speak to the team a couple of years ago.

239
00:15:47.50 --> 00:15:48.50
And we had some great conversations.

240
00:15:48.50 --> 00:15:51.50
But I mean, he's still, he's still that same guy.

241
00:15:51.50 --> 00:15:52.50
Still thinks he can beat me up.

242
00:15:52.50 --> 00:15:55.50
And I get it.

243
00:15:55.50 --> 00:15:58.50
And I'm not asking you in front of your teammates.

244
00:15:58.50 --> 00:16:00.50
You always say you can whip me.

245
00:16:00.50 --> 00:16:02.50
You have to realize now there's not a chance.

246
00:16:02.50 --> 00:16:05.50
He is this, no boy, I'm telling you, I still think I could whip you.

247
00:16:05.50 --> 00:16:06.50
And he'll throw this off for you.

248
00:16:06.50 --> 00:16:07.50
You know, right across.

249
00:16:07.50 --> 00:16:09.50
It's Jerry Attic at this point.

250
00:16:09.50 --> 00:16:10.50
You can barely even get his arm up.

251
00:16:10.50 --> 00:16:12.50
But he still throws it like he can beat me.

252
00:16:12.50 --> 00:16:13.50
He's game.

253
00:16:13.50 --> 00:16:14.50
He's game.

254
00:16:14.50 --> 00:16:14.50
He's game.

255
00:16:14.50 --> 00:16:15.50
The heart's there.

256
00:16:15.50 --> 00:16:17.50
The body got it though.

257
00:16:17.50 --> 00:16:20.50
So you actually, you actually talked about this in the book.

258
00:16:20.50 --> 00:16:21.50
So here we go.

259
00:16:21.50 --> 00:16:25.50
All that effort pain and misery made me a more disciplined human being.

260
00:16:25.50 --> 00:16:30.50
It prepared me for the trials ahead as a marine infantry officer.

261
00:16:30.50 --> 00:16:34.26
In fact, many of the lessons I learned helped me better prepare my

262
00:16:34.26 --> 00:16:37.50
platoon and later my company for combat and I rack.

263
00:16:37.50 --> 00:16:44.50
In football and in a rifle company, there is no substitute for discipline, hard work and commitment.

264
00:16:44.50 --> 00:16:49.50
If any of these elements are lacking, the team is going to lose.

265
00:16:49.50 --> 00:16:54.50
The company will get shot to pieces in combat and men will die.

266
00:16:54.50 --> 00:16:58.50
I learned there is no margin for error in both.

267
00:16:58.50 --> 00:17:05.50
And the only way to be perfect is to demand perfection and never broke excuses.

268
00:17:05.50 --> 00:17:06.50
There you go.

269
00:17:06.50 --> 00:17:07.50
That's life.

270
00:17:07.50 --> 00:17:11.50
I mean, you know, at that point, especially then, that is that is your world.

271
00:17:11.50 --> 00:17:12.50
That is your life.

272
00:17:12.50 --> 00:17:17.50
The military is so unique in that other jobs you can leave it.

273
00:17:17.50 --> 00:17:19.50
5 PM 6 PM whenever you go home from work.

274
00:17:19.50 --> 00:17:21.50
Hey, I am no longer an accountant.

275
00:17:21.50 --> 00:17:23.50
Now I'm Jimmy.

276
00:17:23.50 --> 00:17:24.50
Now I'm Sarah.

277
00:17:24.50 --> 00:17:26.50
Now I'm I'm home ever, right?

278
00:17:26.50 --> 00:17:30.50
But in the military, if you're bad at your job, you're a bad person.

279
00:17:30.50 --> 00:17:32.50
And that's kind of how you're looking for.

280
00:17:32.50 --> 00:17:42.50
If you're not good, if you're not good, if you're not good, if you're not good, if this isn't everything you eat, sleep and breathe, you're weak.

281
00:17:42.50 --> 00:17:45.50
I mean, that's just the kind of environment we have.

282
00:17:45.50 --> 00:17:49.50
And I always tell this story when people look at me like I'm crazy.

283
00:17:49.50 --> 00:17:52.50
I tell them this story.

284
00:17:52.50 --> 00:17:56.50
Had a Marine named James Brown, no affiliation with the famous person.

285
00:17:56.50 --> 00:17:58.50
And James is a great Marine.

286
00:17:58.50 --> 00:18:00.50
He was a tough, tough kid.

287
00:18:00.50 --> 00:18:04.50
And he was in a machine gun post.

288
00:18:04.50 --> 00:18:07.50
Watching over a main avenue of approach.

289
00:18:07.50 --> 00:18:09.50
And his job was to make sure that stayed clear.

290
00:18:09.50 --> 00:18:11.50
The best topics keep a clear of IEDs.

291
00:18:11.50 --> 00:18:13.50
Make sure nobody plants an IED there.

292
00:18:13.50 --> 00:18:18.50
And everything was bulletproof around him, except for the one slit where the 240 Gulf went through.

293
00:18:18.50 --> 00:18:22.50
And it was 125 degrees.

294
00:18:22.50 --> 00:18:25.50
And people always ask, why are the Marines so extreme?

295
00:18:25.50 --> 00:18:29.50
When you make statements like that discipline, commitment, they're everything.

296
00:18:29.50 --> 00:18:30.50
Everything has to be perfect.

297
00:18:30.50 --> 00:18:31.50
I tell them this story.

298
00:18:31.50 --> 00:18:33.50
It got hot.

299
00:18:33.50 --> 00:18:36.50
James leaned against the rifle to get a little breeze through that slit.

300
00:18:36.50 --> 00:18:39.50
And that moment got shot and head by the sniper and died.

301
00:18:39.50 --> 00:18:41.50
And it was an amazing shot.

302
00:18:41.50 --> 00:18:47.50
When we went up there and looked at where I mean, in Iraq, they had some very, very good snipers as we know.

303
00:18:47.50 --> 00:18:50.50
But not one split moment.

304
00:18:50.50 --> 00:18:52.50
I lost that Marine.

305
00:18:52.50 --> 00:18:56.50
And everything we do, everything you do to perfection, that's why.

306
00:18:56.50 --> 00:19:03.50
You demand perfection and everything you do because you are so afraid that they're not going to come home alive.

307
00:19:03.50 --> 00:19:06.50
And I had to tell my Marines this one time, they were lacking in some of their standards.

308
00:19:06.50 --> 00:19:07.50
It's in Iraq.

309
00:19:07.50 --> 00:19:10.50
I made them stand uniform inspections.

310
00:19:10.50 --> 00:19:13.50
Imagine they're attitude as I made them stand three uniform inspections a day.

311
00:19:13.50 --> 00:19:18.50
And they were so mad, but in leadership, you can't do something like that without telling them the why.

312
00:19:18.50 --> 00:19:19.50
They're not going to buy it.

313
00:19:19.50 --> 00:19:20.50
They're just going to hate you now.

314
00:19:20.50 --> 00:19:25.50
And I told my solicit guys, we're not strapping down our ammo and hum these well enough.

315
00:19:25.50 --> 00:19:28.50
We're not cleaning our weapons right after mission like we should be.

316
00:19:28.50 --> 00:19:32.50
Not wearing our uniforms, we get back to camp because you think you're so cool because you've been to a bunch of fire fights.

317
00:19:32.50 --> 00:19:36.50
If we don't do the little things right, it's going to affect the big things.

318
00:19:36.50 --> 00:19:39.50
And ultimately what's going to happen is we are going to die.

319
00:19:39.50 --> 00:19:40.50
We're going to lose.

320
00:19:40.50 --> 00:19:42.50
Or the people who are here to protect are going to die.

321
00:19:42.50 --> 00:19:48.50
Therefore, I'm going to do these uniform inspections until all of these things are fixed permanently.

322
00:19:48.50 --> 00:19:53.50
And I am totally fine with you hating me right now.

323
00:19:53.50 --> 00:19:57.50
If that means I will deliver you home alive with the mission accomplished.

324
00:19:57.50 --> 00:20:02.50
I'd rather you be alive and hate me than you guys love me because you think I'm super cool.

325
00:20:02.50 --> 00:20:10.50
But then have you guys die because of my poor leadership and my inability to keep you guys disciplined and keep you to the standard of perfection.

326
00:20:10.50 --> 00:20:14.50
And that is something it's hard for people who haven't been in that circumstance.

327
00:20:14.50 --> 00:20:16.50
It's hard for them to understand.

328
00:20:16.50 --> 00:20:17.50
It really is.

329
00:20:17.50 --> 00:20:24.50
But even in my current job running a nonprofit, I tell my staff every single veteran they speak to every conversation.

330
00:20:24.50 --> 00:20:28.50
Whether it's the ten time you talk to that vet and you're doing another practice interview.

331
00:20:28.50 --> 00:20:32.50
Our job is to help them find the American dream.

332
00:20:32.50 --> 00:20:38.50
To leave the military by their own choosing and now find not a job but a great career where they can thrive.

333
00:20:38.50 --> 00:20:43.50
And if we take any conversation with them for granted, they may no longer want to take our advice.

334
00:20:43.50 --> 00:20:48.50
They may go out alone, they may not choose the right thing and we failed them.

335
00:20:48.50 --> 00:20:51.50
People give us money not to fail them.

336
00:20:51.50 --> 00:20:56.50
You're paid with other people's money that they gave us to help these vet get jobs.

337
00:20:56.50 --> 00:20:57.50
Period.

338
00:20:57.50 --> 00:21:00.50
If we're not doing that, then you don't work here anymore.

339
00:21:00.50 --> 00:21:02.50
I don't work here anymore.

340
00:21:02.50 --> 00:21:03.50
Period.

341
00:21:03.50 --> 00:21:05.50
We will find somebody else to do it because that's our job.

342
00:21:05.50 --> 00:21:08.50
And so you've got to set that standard.

343
00:21:08.50 --> 00:21:11.50
But if you don't tell them the why behind it, they'll never understand that.

344
00:21:11.50 --> 00:21:13.50
It doesn't mean that we have this culture.

345
00:21:13.50 --> 00:21:18.50
It's not like my platoon had this culture where we were all so hardcore and there was no compassion.

346
00:21:18.50 --> 00:21:21.50
There was no person out there was no smiles as you could attest to.

347
00:21:21.50 --> 00:21:27.50
You can have an environment of discipline, hard work and commitment.

348
00:21:27.50 --> 00:21:32.50
But still have a lot of love, compassion in good times.

349
00:21:32.50 --> 00:21:33.50
They have fun.

350
00:21:33.50 --> 00:21:38.50
You know what's great fun when you go and you train and you're awesome.

351
00:21:38.50 --> 00:21:40.50
You know there's a lot of fun.

352
00:21:40.50 --> 00:21:42.50
The New England Patriots.

353
00:21:42.50 --> 00:21:44.50
They have a hell of a lot of fun.

354
00:21:44.50 --> 00:21:47.50
And you want about discipline and commitment and hard work.

355
00:21:47.50 --> 00:21:48.50
That's why they're on the top.

356
00:21:48.50 --> 00:21:50.50
And they have a lot of fun smile at the end of every season.

357
00:21:50.50 --> 00:21:53.50
Everybody hates on them and they're raising their trophies.

358
00:21:53.50 --> 00:21:59.50
So you got this section in the book that talks about what you're talking about right now.

359
00:21:59.50 --> 00:22:01.50
The leadership factory, right?

360
00:22:01.50 --> 00:22:03.50
So here I'm going to go to the book.

361
00:22:03.50 --> 00:22:07.50
All the academic classes in the world will never teach anyone to be a leader.

362
00:22:07.50 --> 00:22:14.50
The Academy recognized that long ago and while we had to take courses on the subject, we learned by doing.

363
00:22:14.50 --> 00:22:23.50
The Academy of Structure to provide leadership opportunities in a wide variety of places and levels from the very first day you start as plebes.

364
00:22:23.50 --> 00:22:35.50
And this is emphasizing what you just said and discipline is something that I talk about all the time.

365
00:22:35.50 --> 00:22:39.50
And you know what's great as you know as I was talking to you on the way over here.

366
00:22:39.50 --> 00:22:43.50
You know I do all these I read these leadership or not leadership books.

367
00:22:43.50 --> 00:22:44.50
They're not books about leadership.

368
00:22:44.50 --> 00:22:45.50
They're about combat, right?

369
00:22:45.50 --> 00:22:47.50
But combat is about leadership.

370
00:22:47.50 --> 00:22:49.50
So all these books, all of them.

371
00:22:49.50 --> 00:22:59.50
Every single one of them, whether it's an ancient Roman military leader or a marine in Vietnam or an army soldier in World War II,

372
00:22:59.50 --> 00:23:03.50
they all, there is one common thing that's discipline discipline discipline.

373
00:23:03.50 --> 00:23:05.50
It's always there.

374
00:23:05.50 --> 00:23:09.50
Back to the book, discipline forms the cornerstone of any military team.

375
00:23:09.50 --> 00:23:15.50
And of course, punishment serves as one of the means to maintain discipline.

376
00:23:15.50 --> 00:23:20.50
During my junior year, I learned not to be afraid to meet out punishment.

377
00:23:20.50 --> 00:23:27.50
At the same time doing so requires a balance of appropriateness and understanding.

378
00:23:27.50 --> 00:23:29.50
So that's the why you just talked about right there.

379
00:23:29.50 --> 00:23:35.50
And this again goes to something that I talk about a lot which is which is the dichotomy of leadership,

380
00:23:35.50 --> 00:23:37.50
which is in leadership.

381
00:23:37.50 --> 00:23:40.50
There's there's opposing forces that are pulling you into different directions.

382
00:23:40.50 --> 00:23:41.50
And both of them are right.

383
00:23:41.50 --> 00:23:42.50
They're both right.

384
00:23:42.50 --> 00:23:45.50
It's right to be hard on your guys and maintain strict discipline.

385
00:23:45.50 --> 00:23:47.50
And it's right to love your guys and take care of them.

386
00:23:47.50 --> 00:23:48.50
You have to balance those two.

387
00:23:48.50 --> 00:23:50.50
And that's what you're talking about right there.

388
00:23:50.50 --> 00:23:52.50
That's what you were talking about when you were talking about.

389
00:23:52.50 --> 00:23:55.50
They need to understand why they're being punished, punished.

390
00:23:55.50 --> 00:23:57.50
Back to the book.

391
00:23:57.50 --> 00:24:01.50
Bad officers try to be buddies with their Marines.

392
00:24:01.50 --> 00:24:08.50
There's a fine line between getting to know the men under your command and bonding with them as friends.

393
00:24:08.50 --> 00:24:11.50
It is all too easy to make that mistake.

394
00:24:11.50 --> 00:24:13.50
At the same time, here's the balance.

395
00:24:13.50 --> 00:24:23.50
At the same time, if a young second lieutenant doesn't make an effort to know his men, his aloofness becomes a drag and will hinder his ability to command in several ways.

396
00:24:23.50 --> 00:24:26.50
First, you won't understand the strengths and weaknesses of his squads.

397
00:24:26.50 --> 00:24:34.50
More important, he won't have the respect or the connection needed to motivate and lead in the worst of circumstances.

398
00:24:34.50 --> 00:24:40.50
Men will follow other men into the worst possible circumstances if they respect and believe in their leadership.

399
00:24:40.50 --> 00:24:45.50
Like all other aspects of command, it is a delicate balance.

400
00:24:45.50 --> 00:24:50.50
You're just everything you just said, you say it in the book.

401
00:24:50.50 --> 00:24:54.50
And that's why you're talking about the leadership factory.

402
00:24:54.50 --> 00:24:55.50
But it's interesting.

403
00:24:55.50 --> 00:24:58.50
This is stuff that I'm sure they touched on it in the classes.

404
00:24:58.50 --> 00:24:59.50
But that's the stuff that you learn.

405
00:24:59.50 --> 00:25:01.50
You learn it from senior and listed people.

406
00:25:01.50 --> 00:25:02.50
You learn it from other officers.

407
00:25:02.50 --> 00:25:03.50
You learn it yourself.

408
00:25:03.50 --> 00:25:05.50
You work for people and you go, man, this guy's aloof.

409
00:25:05.50 --> 00:25:06.50
This guy's not talking to us.

410
00:25:06.50 --> 00:25:08.50
So it's stuff that we learn ourselves too.

411
00:25:08.50 --> 00:25:10.50
I'm going to finish this section up.

412
00:25:10.50 --> 00:25:12.50
I concluded the proper balance here,

413
00:25:12.50 --> 00:25:16.50
depending on the officer's ability to listen and accept input.

414
00:25:16.50 --> 00:25:19.50
While still making it clear that he was the ultimate decision maker,

415
00:25:19.50 --> 00:25:21.50
that was the key.

416
00:25:21.50 --> 00:25:27.50
A second lieutenant couldn't be afraid to engage in frank and productive dialogue with his key leaders.

417
00:25:27.50 --> 00:25:34.50
A platoon becomes the reflection of its commander.

418
00:25:34.50 --> 00:25:36.50
He sets the example.

419
00:25:36.50 --> 00:25:39.50
And this is from what you just said.

420
00:25:39.50 --> 00:25:42.50
If his uniform is jacked up, his men won't care about their own.

421
00:25:42.50 --> 00:25:46.50
This leads to disciplinary issues and becomes a very slippery slope.

422
00:25:46.50 --> 00:25:51.50
The only way a second lieutenant can have the moral authority to set a high standard

423
00:25:51.50 --> 00:25:58.50
is to set a high standard for conditioning and appearance is to speed the example himself.

424
00:25:58.50 --> 00:26:02.50
Without conditioning, a platoon can not achieve its potential in the field.

425
00:26:02.50 --> 00:26:06.50
Aggressiveness suffers.

426
00:26:06.50 --> 00:26:12.50
Appearance breeds pride and reinforces discipline and a speed of core.

427
00:26:12.50 --> 00:26:16.50
So those, that's the leadership factor that you're talking about.

428
00:26:16.50 --> 00:26:20.50
And clearly, those things that you brought from the football field and from the academy,

429
00:26:20.50 --> 00:26:22.50
you applied them directly into your folks in combat.

430
00:26:22.50 --> 00:26:24.50
They helped and you know,

431
00:26:24.50 --> 00:26:28.50
the Marine Corps has a really unique circumstance where they have the basic school,

432
00:26:28.50 --> 00:26:34.50
every single officer goes there. And that's huge to set this huge standard.

433
00:26:34.50 --> 00:26:38.50
Then we go step further where when we go to infantry officer course,

434
00:26:38.50 --> 00:26:40.50
that course was 13 weeks long.

435
00:26:40.50 --> 00:26:45.50
One of the very hardest if not the hardest in the Marine Corps, mentally physically everything.

436
00:26:45.50 --> 00:26:48.50
You don't know anything that's coming, everything's a surprise.

437
00:26:48.50 --> 00:26:52.50
But I felt that my instructors during our course were phenomenal.

438
00:26:52.50 --> 00:26:56.50
And they were getting all the real time intelligence from the battlefield.

439
00:26:56.50 --> 00:26:58.50
All the training was realistic.

440
00:26:58.50 --> 00:27:05.50
But in terms of how you relate to your Marines from your junior and listed to your middle rank,

441
00:27:05.50 --> 00:27:10.50
to your senior and listed, how you relate to the senior and listed from the battalion,

442
00:27:10.50 --> 00:27:14.50
who worked directly for the battalion staff, how you manage those relationships

443
00:27:14.50 --> 00:27:20.50
to maximize the effectiveness of your platoon to make sure you can get exactly what they need.

444
00:27:20.50 --> 00:27:22.50
They did such a good job of that.

445
00:27:22.50 --> 00:27:26.50
And then you take a one step further when I reported a third battalion, second Marines, I'd be remiss

446
00:27:26.50 --> 00:27:31.50
if I didn't give credit to a guy by the name of Gabe Diana, who is a Lieutenant Colonel in the Marine Corps.

447
00:27:31.50 --> 00:27:32.50
Now I believe.

448
00:27:32.50 --> 00:27:37.50
But he taught me he was a true student of leadership and military history.

449
00:27:37.50 --> 00:27:40.50
He would tell me all the time, his craft is his hobby.

450
00:27:40.50 --> 00:27:42.50
There's nothing else he cared about.

451
00:27:42.50 --> 00:27:45.50
It's what he was. He loved being a Marine Love Being an Officer.

452
00:27:45.50 --> 00:27:50.50
And he taught me a lot about decentralized leadership.

453
00:27:50.50 --> 00:27:52.50
How to not micromanage.

454
00:27:52.50 --> 00:27:57.50
How to empower your junior leaders that they start to think like you and you could achieve

455
00:27:57.50 --> 00:27:59.50
tempo on the battlefield.

456
00:27:59.50 --> 00:28:02.50
And you could immediately see examples of Marines.

457
00:28:02.50 --> 00:28:06.50
I call it, and I see it all the time in the business world.

458
00:28:06.50 --> 00:28:12.50
I call it JV Leadership, where I'm a great leader if my people love me.

459
00:28:12.50 --> 00:28:15.50
And they're the same leaders that will tell their people our guys.

460
00:28:15.50 --> 00:28:19.50
Today we've got to stay 30 minutes longer because headquarters said so.

461
00:28:19.50 --> 00:28:20.50
Look, I disagree with it.

462
00:28:20.50 --> 00:28:23.50
I think it's ridiculous, but we have to do it.

463
00:28:23.50 --> 00:28:24.50
Let's just sit here together.

464
00:28:24.50 --> 00:28:27.50
Now none of their people are actually going to work motivated.

465
00:28:27.50 --> 00:28:28.50
There's going to be no discipline.

466
00:28:28.50 --> 00:28:31.50
There's going to be no standard that they're trying to achieve because of that horrible

467
00:28:31.50 --> 00:28:32.50
leadership.

468
00:28:32.50 --> 00:28:34.50
Yeah, they're angry at headquarters.

469
00:28:34.50 --> 00:28:35.50
Absolutely.

470
00:28:35.50 --> 00:28:37.50
They're they're bat mad at the chain of command.

471
00:28:37.50 --> 00:28:38.50
Exactly.

472
00:28:38.50 --> 00:28:39.50
That's JV Leadership.

473
00:28:39.50 --> 00:28:42.50
And I'm constantly trying to talk to people about that.

474
00:28:42.50 --> 00:28:47.50
A JV Leadership, the first thing that is you think you have to be loved to be an effective leader.

475
00:28:47.50 --> 00:28:53.50
If you are an effective leader over the long term, you will be loved, but there's going to be an intermittent part where they can't stand you.

476
00:28:53.50 --> 00:28:55.50
They don't understand things all the time.

477
00:28:55.50 --> 00:28:57.50
They're going to be mad at you, because it's because they're emotional.

478
00:28:57.50 --> 00:29:00.50
But over a long term, they're going to understand that what you did was best.

479
00:29:00.50 --> 00:29:05.50
The other, the second major part to JV Leadership is thinking, hey, I'm in charge.

480
00:29:05.50 --> 00:29:08.50
Therefore, I come up with all the great ideas.

481
00:29:08.50 --> 00:29:14.50
And I'm going to make every single decision without your input. And I'm going to really try hard to make sure that you know what I am in charge.

482
00:29:14.50 --> 00:29:16.50
That's ridiculous.

483
00:29:16.50 --> 00:29:18.50
It is not your job to come up with all the great ideas.

484
00:29:18.50 --> 00:29:22.50
Some of the best ideas I receive were from 19 year olds.

485
00:29:22.50 --> 00:29:26.50
You know, 21 year olds who had already been to Iraq once had a grace.

486
00:29:26.50 --> 00:29:27.50
I got a great idea.

487
00:29:27.50 --> 00:29:29.50
Well, I want to hear all about.

488
00:29:29.50 --> 00:29:36.50
It's, it's, it's our job as leaders to decide which are the best ideas to invest energy time and resources in.

489
00:29:36.50 --> 00:29:40.50
And that's not just, I get all this stuff all the time when I talk to different groups and companies.

490
00:29:40.50 --> 00:29:45.50
Well, military leadership is different than corporate leadership. Why?

491
00:29:45.50 --> 00:29:47.50
What am I saying here that doesn't apply?

492
00:29:47.50 --> 00:29:50.50
Well, it's too extreme.

493
00:29:50.50 --> 00:29:51.50
It is not.

494
00:29:51.50 --> 00:29:56.50
You're taking us to literal with, with our warrior mentalities here.

495
00:29:56.50 --> 00:30:01.50
You know, that, that you do not need to be an insecure, the best leaders are not insecure.

496
00:30:01.50 --> 00:30:05.50
They're secure. They know that they're there and ultimately going to make the final decision.

497
00:30:05.50 --> 00:30:13.50
But it empowers your people and you could achieve tempo when your decentralized enough that they feel good about coming up with ideas.

498
00:30:13.50 --> 00:30:18.50
Sending them up to you to get back up for it and get resources behind it.

499
00:30:18.50 --> 00:30:23.50
But also knowing that they could make the appropriate decision to their level because they know what your final intent is.

500
00:30:23.50 --> 00:30:25.50
Here's the outcome I want to achieve.

501
00:30:25.50 --> 00:30:26.50
You get us there.

502
00:30:26.50 --> 00:30:29.50
You're the expert at it. That's why I hired you.

503
00:30:29.50 --> 00:30:34.50
I didn't tell my machine gun or to work their T and E system and how to sight in their machine guns, right?

504
00:30:34.50 --> 00:30:36.50
I just told them what I wanted them to hit. They're better than that.

505
00:30:36.50 --> 00:30:46.50
It may take the time to spend it with my Marines and their different functions and aspects and talk to them about how they're there, the expert and compliment them like that.

506
00:30:46.50 --> 00:30:48.50
It made them feel great.

507
00:30:48.50 --> 00:30:55.50
It does wonders for a leader to go to their level, see what they do every day and see that expert work.

508
00:30:55.50 --> 00:30:59.50
Consider an expect you to be an expert in all of that. They know that.

509
00:30:59.50 --> 00:31:04.50
Your job is different. Your responsibilities are different. You need to have greater perspective.

510
00:31:04.50 --> 00:31:12.50
But when you go to their level and respect what they do and show them respect for what they do and how they do it,

511
00:31:12.50 --> 00:31:20.50
man, it's a powerful thing that that could make a group of people so much better collectively than they ever would have been individually.

512
00:31:20.50 --> 00:31:26.50
And when it happens, right? When it finally when you finally get there and can achieve that, it is awesome.

513
00:31:26.50 --> 00:31:28.50
It's the most rewarding experience you could ever have.

514
00:31:28.50 --> 00:31:33.50
And it's hard for people to understand because most people they well, the most rewarding experience you have is killing people.

515
00:31:33.50 --> 00:31:37.50
No, it's so much different than that.

516
00:31:37.50 --> 00:31:40.50
So much different. There's so much more to it than that.

517
00:31:40.50 --> 00:31:43.50
Yeah, yeah, it's interesting too.

518
00:31:43.50 --> 00:31:49.50
That by the way, what you're saying right now is basically the entire book that my buddy, Dave Babich,

519
00:31:49.50 --> 00:31:54.50
there's a chapter in there called the Centralized Commandery, everything you're saying.

520
00:31:54.50 --> 00:32:00.50
But that's why you've come up in a completely different, you know, in the Marine Corps, I was in the Navy.

521
00:32:00.50 --> 00:32:04.50
And yet, you know, you and I have both, I can tell right now,

522
00:32:04.50 --> 00:32:07.50
basically completely aligned leadership principles.

523
00:32:07.50 --> 00:32:12.50
Isn't it interesting though that some guys don't get it?

524
00:32:12.50 --> 00:32:17.50
They don't get it and you could explain it to them and you'd say, listen man, hey,

525
00:32:17.50 --> 00:32:19.50
you don't need to make every decision.

526
00:32:19.50 --> 00:32:22.50
And in fact, when you get out and firefly, you won't be able to make every decision.

527
00:32:22.50 --> 00:32:25.50
You're going to have to let your leaders lead and you're going to let the after let.

528
00:32:25.50 --> 00:32:29.50
And they would listen to you and you could see it going right through their head.

529
00:32:29.50 --> 00:32:35.50
It's wild. You wonder what psychologically is going on in there that makes you want to rebel.

530
00:32:35.50 --> 00:32:39.50
In a lot of times, it's hey, they got a bad review from this officer.

531
00:32:39.50 --> 00:32:43.50
So this is their way of saying, you know, hey, you know, go fly a kite.

532
00:32:43.50 --> 00:32:48.50
You know, this is their way of rebelling. I noticed that with some officers.

533
00:32:48.50 --> 00:32:52.50
And in some of the, and I had, I had to firely tent it during my second deployment.

534
00:32:52.50 --> 00:32:56.50
And, and he had this problem, you know, he kept feeling he had to be best friends with this marines.

535
00:32:56.50 --> 00:32:59.50
He spent way too much time with him talking about a lot of personal stuff.

536
00:32:59.50 --> 00:33:02.50
They'd be out of control and nobody would listen to him.

537
00:33:02.50 --> 00:33:04.50
I mean, it was almost straight meaning.

538
00:33:04.50 --> 00:33:10.50
And then when I had to fire him and here's the thing is, and I tell him, look, you're a really good person.

539
00:33:10.50 --> 00:33:15.50
And you are most likely going to be very successful in whatever you choose to do.

540
00:33:15.50 --> 00:33:20.50
So please, please remember that. It's hard to hear that now.

541
00:33:20.50 --> 00:33:23.50
This is a very unique job.

542
00:33:23.50 --> 00:33:26.50
And we are in a very dangerous scenario. We were already in Iraq.

543
00:33:26.50 --> 00:33:28.50
And we were in a dangerous area at the time.

544
00:33:28.50 --> 00:33:30.50
And things were about to go south.

545
00:33:30.50 --> 00:33:34.50
And I had to remove this kid now before things got worse.

546
00:33:34.50 --> 00:33:38.50
And it was hard for me to understand that you can be a phenomenal human being.

547
00:33:38.50 --> 00:33:44.50
A great person, but just not meant to lead, especially in those circumstances.

548
00:33:44.50 --> 00:33:47.50
But it's some people.

549
00:33:47.50 --> 00:33:55.50
And I think, obviously, if they have so many years growing up in a household where it was so different from what they're being taught.

550
00:33:55.50 --> 00:33:59.50
That I think sometimes is the root for them to push back against this type of leadership.

551
00:33:59.50 --> 00:34:02.50
No, you know, I've been taught differently for years and years.

552
00:34:02.50 --> 00:34:08.50
It's kind of like, wow, did you just block it all out for the year and a half you've been in school before you got here?

553
00:34:08.50 --> 00:34:13.50
With guys with all this combat experience, I'm not to mention hundreds of years of history.

554
00:34:13.50 --> 00:34:14.50
Yes.

555
00:34:14.50 --> 00:34:18.50
Of combat experience, same look, this is the best way to do it.

556
00:34:18.50 --> 00:34:21.50
Yes. And same, no, I'm going to do a different thing.

557
00:34:21.50 --> 00:34:23.50
I mean, the military is a business.

558
00:34:23.50 --> 00:34:25.50
It is a business. It's run like a business.

559
00:34:25.50 --> 00:34:33.50
And the leadership there, it's about maximizing the potential of all the human beings that you have on your team.

560
00:34:33.50 --> 00:34:34.50
And how do you do that?

561
00:34:34.50 --> 00:34:38.50
Yes, it involves tactics and what we do is different.

562
00:34:38.50 --> 00:34:42.50
But the personal, the small unit down to the large unit leadership is all the same.

563
00:34:42.50 --> 00:34:43.50
It's all the same.

564
00:34:43.50 --> 00:34:45.50
It's all the same.

565
00:34:45.50 --> 00:34:49.50
And you go around and you talk to different executives who are having trouble well, you know,

566
00:34:49.50 --> 00:34:53.50
you know, it's the millennials and what they do and what they do and this do.

567
00:34:53.50 --> 00:34:55.50
And we were talking about it right here.

568
00:34:55.50 --> 00:34:58.50
People, the experts always want to blame some kind of process.

569
00:34:58.50 --> 00:35:04.50
I think your process and your information flow is wrong and the way that you have your workflow set up in the office space,

570
00:35:04.50 --> 00:35:07.50
that's causing this issue in communication.

571
00:35:07.50 --> 00:35:14.50
No, it's not. You're saying that because you are afraid to have the heart conversations with the leaders who are failing.

572
00:35:14.50 --> 00:35:17.50
Oh, which by the way, you're one of the leaders. Yes.

573
00:35:17.50 --> 00:35:23.50
Yes. So when you're failing as a business and you've got these issues, yeah, it's pretty, you're going to be one of the problems.

574
00:35:23.50 --> 00:35:26.50
And you might need help square in that away. And that's okay.

575
00:35:26.50 --> 00:35:26.50
That's okay.

576
00:35:26.50 --> 00:35:31.50
Well, you know, another thing I noticed in business world is a lot of people in the business world.

577
00:35:31.50 --> 00:35:33.50
They have no leadership training.

578
00:35:33.50 --> 00:35:37.50
They've figured it out. They've been lucky and successful and they've gotten by with good people.

579
00:35:37.50 --> 00:35:41.50
And then they get to a certain point where all of the sudden they're going to wait a second. I can't handle this anymore.

580
00:35:41.50 --> 00:35:47.50
You know, if you grow from six people that you know pretty well that you trust and all of a sudden you got to staff of a hundred people.

581
00:35:47.50 --> 00:35:52.50
If you don't start learning how to lead, you're going to have significant problems and it's going to blow up.

582
00:35:52.50 --> 00:35:56.50
And that happens from a hundred people to 300 people and then from 300 people to a thousand people.

583
00:35:56.50 --> 00:36:02.50
It will happen every time and you got to train those leaders throughout the chain of command that all have the same understanding of the fundamental principle.

584
00:36:02.50 --> 00:36:06.50
The fundamental principles of combat leadership, which is leadership.

585
00:36:06.50 --> 00:36:10.50
I have the thought combat in there because that was my little job.

586
00:36:10.50 --> 00:36:13.50
You know, it's funny you bring that up. There's a great example.

587
00:36:13.50 --> 00:36:18.50
Dan Quinn is the current head coach of the Atlanta Falcons. He was a defensive coordinator at Seattle.

588
00:36:18.50 --> 00:36:20.50
Hires the head coach in Atlanta.

589
00:36:20.50 --> 00:36:27.50
And through his, he's a very good friend of Jake Laser who's obviously very involved in mixed martial arts and does a lot of the fox broadcasts.

590
00:36:27.50 --> 00:36:29.50
And I've worked with him and gotten close with him.

591
00:36:29.50 --> 00:36:33.50
And so Jay introduced me to Dan. Dan was looking to make the team tougher.

592
00:36:33.50 --> 00:36:37.50
And here's a guy who has achieved the highest level of leadership in coaching.

593
00:36:37.50 --> 00:36:40.50
Just like you talked about. He was a great coordinator.

594
00:36:40.50 --> 00:36:47.50
Now he's a head coach. And he had the humility to seek out experts from all I mean, he went to different sports.

595
00:36:47.50 --> 00:36:50.50
Talk to their head coaches. He went to the military.

596
00:36:50.50 --> 00:36:58.50
He went all over with humility to ask and get advice and glean experience from other people's time and leadership.

597
00:36:58.50 --> 00:37:02.50
To include, I couldn't believe it. But here I am having breakfast with the man.

598
00:37:02.50 --> 00:37:06.50
Here I'm in his office or I'm in there and you know, their little cafeteria there.

599
00:37:06.50 --> 00:37:09.50
We're just talking leadership. And he's talking about some of his individual guys.

600
00:37:09.50 --> 00:37:11.50
And he's actually listening to my opinion.

601
00:37:11.50 --> 00:37:18.50
Wanted to hear what I went through. My opinion on this guy or that guy is he brought me in to do some martial arts drills to make the team tougher.

602
00:37:18.50 --> 00:37:22.50
But I gained so much respect for that. Here's a man who's achieved the highest level.

603
00:37:22.50 --> 00:37:25.50
He knows he's in charge. He's not out to prove anything.

604
00:37:25.50 --> 00:37:30.50
Guys know he's in charge. And when they don't meet the standard, there's a consequence.

605
00:37:30.50 --> 00:37:38.50
But at the same time, he shows them the same kind of humility as he seeks out advice to get better everyday because he wants them.

606
00:37:38.50 --> 00:37:42.50
Hey, Julio Jones, I know you think you're the best wide receiver in football.

607
00:37:42.50 --> 00:37:46.50
But there's ways you can get better. And you need to be humble enough to find them.

608
00:37:46.50 --> 00:37:54.50
And guess what? Julio goes first in every drill. The dudes that I mean, I've watched him, works as hard as any human being I've seen in the football field.

609
00:37:54.50 --> 00:37:58.50
He's always looking to get better. Matt Ryan the same. And look at the position the teams in now.

610
00:37:58.50 --> 00:38:07.50
But he is continually done that. He turned to Navy SEALs last summer brought seals in to work with his team, to work with him on leadership, on accountability.

611
00:38:07.50 --> 00:38:10.50
And all this combat, but leadership.

612
00:38:10.50 --> 00:38:19.50
And bring it into that locker room and create this cohesive unit that has had a tremendous turnaround from the 2015 season to now 2016.

613
00:38:19.50 --> 00:38:27.50
Now let's see championship. Again, for you, reciting my book, which is what you do because we're going to chat with the nerds called Czecherega.

614
00:38:27.50 --> 00:38:33.50
And you know, my point is the number one, the number one characteristic that a leader has to have is humility.

615
00:38:33.50 --> 00:38:37.50
And if you don't have that, all those things that you just talked about, you won't do any of them. You won't ever get better.

616
00:38:37.50 --> 00:38:44.50
You won't listen to anybody else. You won't take any advice. You can't, that's, that's a horrible thing.

617
00:38:44.50 --> 00:38:50.50
Let me, let me, let me get us back on track to your life a little bit here.

618
00:38:50.50 --> 00:38:53.50
Why did you pick the Marine Corps?

619
00:38:53.50 --> 00:38:55.50
Because I couldn't swim.

620
00:38:55.50 --> 00:39:04.50
No, and all honesty, you know, I thought for a while that I wanted to be a team guy playing football and trying to be a seal.

621
00:39:04.50 --> 00:39:13.50
It's extremely competitive. You know who went into the teams and, I mean, physical specimens discipline there in Credwell.

622
00:39:13.50 --> 00:39:17.50
I was just going to be a team for four years, then go and do all these different screeners.

623
00:39:17.50 --> 00:39:24.50
And for me, not having spent four years in the pool was costly because when it came time for me to do this screener to go do many buds,

624
00:39:24.50 --> 00:39:28.50
it was basically like a mini hell week for four straight days of the academy was tough.

625
00:39:28.50 --> 00:39:33.50
And we broke the ice and the chest peak, all of that, you know, I trained for it for two weeks.

626
00:39:33.50 --> 00:39:37.50
Right. I still had a shoulder problem and a hamstring prompt in the season.

627
00:39:37.50 --> 00:39:40.50
I mean, it was just not going to work. I was not going to compete with these guys for it.

628
00:39:40.50 --> 00:39:45.50
But ultimately what attracted me was the Warner racket started.

629
00:39:45.50 --> 00:39:52.50
A lot of my buddies were in the march-up that I had played with that were graduated before me.

630
00:39:52.50 --> 00:39:59.50
I had talked to some folks that were in special operations and seals and they talked about it and it's a smaller team.

631
00:39:59.50 --> 00:40:08.50
So it's a little bit different whereas in the Marine Corps, the leadership, you know, a very young age you're going to have 40 some Marines.

632
00:40:08.50 --> 00:40:14.50
You'll go on to be a company commander at this level. You're going to get a legitimate opportunity to command large scale units.

633
00:40:14.50 --> 00:40:16.50
And that was really appealing to me.

634
00:40:16.50 --> 00:40:17.50
It's awesome.

635
00:40:17.50 --> 00:40:22.50
And I thought that that was probably the best opportunity for me because if I was going to try to then be a team guy,

636
00:40:22.50 --> 00:40:25.50
I was going to have to go into the Navy as a surface warfare officer.

637
00:40:25.50 --> 00:40:30.50
And then after two years, so then after two years, so they're all trying to get to buds.

638
00:40:30.50 --> 00:40:32.50
And there's no guarantees.

639
00:40:32.50 --> 00:40:39.50
Being a seal is extraordinarily competitive and the physical requirements as officers to get there are really, really high.

640
00:40:39.50 --> 00:40:44.50
And so for me, the Marine Corps had an amazing appeal.

641
00:40:44.50 --> 00:40:47.50
Did you know about the Marine Corps when you went to the Naval Academy though?

642
00:40:47.50 --> 00:40:50.50
I wasn't, I did, so I went to leave some because they run.

643
00:40:50.50 --> 00:40:56.50
They run it and I'll tell you a lot of the people at the Naval Academy when I was there hated the Marines.

644
00:40:56.50 --> 00:41:02.50
Were you so many of them went there with a chip on their shoulder? You know, this is the Naval Academy.

645
00:41:02.50 --> 00:41:06.50
There's no Marine Corps stuff in it. And we get our opportunity. We're really going to be jerks.

646
00:41:06.50 --> 00:41:10.50
And we had this great Lieutenant Colonel when I was a senior.

647
00:41:10.50 --> 00:41:15.50
And we had all been selected to be Marines who told us, look, this is not the real Marine Corps.

648
00:41:15.50 --> 00:41:21.50
They're not representing us well. We've got a bad crop here right now that are trying to prove a point.

649
00:41:21.50 --> 00:41:26.50
When you get to the basic school, you're going to find that it's massively different.

650
00:41:26.50 --> 00:41:31.50
And I loved everything about that. I loved the diversity of my Marines.

651
00:41:31.50 --> 00:41:33.50
I mean, we talk about race.

652
00:41:33.50 --> 00:41:37.50
Race is a big deal. Racism in our country. It's a big topic.

653
00:41:37.50 --> 00:41:42.50
I mean, there's constantly battles on all the Hollywood news sites going on about race.

654
00:41:42.50 --> 00:41:46.50
Didn't exist. What else in the Marine Corps?

655
00:41:46.50 --> 00:41:48.50
Men from all over the world.

656
00:41:48.50 --> 00:41:53.50
They're green marines. It didn't matter. It did not matter.

657
00:41:53.50 --> 00:41:57.50
We didn't care. Everybody, hey, this is so much of the salt we didn't care.

658
00:41:57.50 --> 00:42:00.50
We had a missionary day. We trained together. We bled together.

659
00:42:00.50 --> 00:42:04.50
And it was phenomenal. None of that stuff existed because we won together.

660
00:42:04.50 --> 00:42:08.50
We suffered together. And we looked beyond all of it.

661
00:42:08.50 --> 00:42:16.50
It just doesn't matter in the military. And it's so frustrating to see it matters so much here in the regular world.

662
00:42:16.50 --> 00:42:19.50
Where people have all kinds of preconceived things.

663
00:42:19.50 --> 00:42:26.50
And in some people are out there acting like they're fighting on for the better of race relations in our country.

664
00:42:26.50 --> 00:42:30.50
And they're making it worse because they've got their own personal agenda as they do it.

665
00:42:30.50 --> 00:42:32.50
It's just really frustrating.

666
00:42:32.50 --> 00:42:38.50
Yeah. Well, I definitely in the military, like you said, everyone's wearing the same uniform.

667
00:42:38.50 --> 00:42:43.50
And I'm sure in the 50s and 60s and even into the 70s, it was a big deal.

668
00:42:43.50 --> 00:42:46.50
They stamped it out because it doesn't matter.

669
00:42:46.50 --> 00:42:52.50
It's no factor. One way or the other. It's no factor. It's pretty awesome.

670
00:42:52.50 --> 00:42:56.50
Yeah. Went to the basic school.

671
00:42:56.50 --> 00:43:00.50
You got stalled in the basic school for a little bit of time.

672
00:43:00.50 --> 00:43:04.50
And you know, going through some legal stuff.

673
00:43:04.50 --> 00:43:10.50
And while you're stalled at the basic school, your friends start going on deployment.

674
00:43:10.50 --> 00:43:21.50
And all of a sudden you got your classmates, your friends, your brothers are getting killed.

675
00:43:21.50 --> 00:43:27.50
And you know, that feeling of being on sidelines.

676
00:43:27.50 --> 00:43:33.50
I think it's really hard to explain to people and you do a good job in the book that I'll highlight a couple times.

677
00:43:33.50 --> 00:43:40.50
I heard this quote one time. I'm not, I'm going to throw it out there as best I can.

678
00:43:40.50 --> 00:43:51.50
But for women, like they have, an intrinsic biological desire to have children, not all women.

679
00:43:51.50 --> 00:43:54.50
But a lot of women, let's say.

680
00:43:54.50 --> 00:44:00.50
And a lot of men have an intrinsic desire to go to war.

681
00:44:00.50 --> 00:44:06.50
I don't know why that is. I know I had it since I can remember having human emotions.

682
00:44:06.50 --> 00:44:17.50
I wanted to go to war. You know, I mean, when you're a kid, the first thing you do when you pick up a stick is you shape it into a gun and start pointing it out your friends and trying to kill them.

683
00:44:17.50 --> 00:44:27.50
Right. So here you were on the sidelines sitting back and, and your friends are starting to get killed.

684
00:44:27.50 --> 00:44:32.50
Wow. What did that do to your psychology? It was, it was dark.

685
00:44:32.50 --> 00:44:36.50
It was psychologically that was the most challenging time period of my life.

686
00:44:36.50 --> 00:44:43.50
You've got someone challenging your character and your honor trying to say that you were something that you weren't.

687
00:44:43.50 --> 00:44:48.50
And I wouldn't allow it. There were there were easier ways to speed up the process and I refused.

688
00:44:48.50 --> 00:44:51.50
No way. I know what happened.

689
00:44:51.50 --> 00:44:58.50
And during that delay, it was a very, very dark period. And it was difficult.

690
00:44:58.50 --> 00:45:07.50
But you have to, you have to slow life down sometimes, gain perspective and realize, hey, look, this is going to take some time.

691
00:45:07.50 --> 00:45:17.50
Eventually, I am going to get there. But what really turned into when the opportunity finally came to progress, using my time wisely,

692
00:45:17.50 --> 00:45:23.50
the war wasn't going to go away tomorrow. You know, sometimes you get this feeling your mind like, oh, man, my friends are out there dying.

693
00:45:23.50 --> 00:45:29.50
They're leading. I need to be with them right now, realizing, whoa, it's not going to be gone tomorrow.

694
00:45:29.50 --> 00:45:34.50
So don't be so anxious. Don't waste the time you have now to get better.

695
00:45:34.50 --> 00:45:42.50
What can I do? I'm not going to let this stupid instance hold me back from improving from when I eventually do go on to lead Marines.

696
00:45:42.50 --> 00:45:49.50
And so I found a way to contribute value. I found a way to get better. It didn't happen right away.

697
00:45:49.50 --> 00:45:53.50
You know, there was a couple of weeks where it was dark, where I was angry.

698
00:45:53.50 --> 00:46:02.50
But I snapped out of it because there's times in life where life and your psychology, they want, you want to be the victim, right?

699
00:46:02.50 --> 00:46:10.50
You want to feel like you've been wrong. And the problem is, a lot of times when you go into that mode and you start playing the victim,

700
00:46:10.50 --> 00:46:15.50
you never crawl out of it. You get stuck in that world of the victim.

701
00:46:15.50 --> 00:46:20.50
You get stuck in this world that you think is all bad luck and everything's always going against you.

702
00:46:20.50 --> 00:46:24.50
And you stop driving, you know, your own life.

703
00:46:24.50 --> 00:46:30.50
You got to crawl out of that when you're, when your mind is telling you to play the victim and to feel bad for yourself,

704
00:46:30.50 --> 00:46:32.50
nothing positive comes from that.

705
00:46:32.50 --> 00:46:40.50
Something did something specific snap you out of that mindset that your mom tell you something or you're, he was right.

706
00:46:40.50 --> 00:46:41.50
They talk about that.

707
00:46:41.50 --> 00:46:42.50
Oh, that's right. That's right.

708
00:46:42.50 --> 00:46:43.50
You should.

709
00:46:43.50 --> 00:46:51.50
I mean, my, my, my mom is the sweetest woman in the world, too. But there are specific time in my life where she was extremely hard on me.

710
00:46:51.50 --> 00:46:53.50
Don't want to give mom a stand.

711
00:46:53.50 --> 00:46:54.50
They were at the right times.

712
00:46:54.50 --> 00:46:56.50
You, you, you'd meet her now.

713
00:46:56.50 --> 00:46:57.50
You know, I'm going to finish this.

714
00:46:57.50 --> 00:46:58.50
So you push over.

715
00:46:58.50 --> 00:47:02.50
But there are times where she, you, hey, you're going to fight this.

716
00:47:02.50 --> 00:47:03.50
Understand me.

717
00:47:03.50 --> 00:47:05.50
You're going to fight this.

718
00:47:05.50 --> 00:47:06.50
You're right.

719
00:47:06.50 --> 00:47:08.50
That's it.

720
00:47:08.50 --> 00:47:09.50
And you move forward.

721
00:47:09.50 --> 00:47:15.50
And you, oh, just like we all, oh, the, the friends that you lose.

722
00:47:15.50 --> 00:47:21.50
There are many different ways that we could remember them, that we could memorialize them.

723
00:47:21.50 --> 00:47:24.50
Some people choose the wrong way in my opinion.

724
00:47:24.50 --> 00:47:33.50
Substance alcohol, depression, you know, they choose more of a victim mind that way of remembering them.

725
00:47:33.50 --> 00:47:37.50
Others choose, hey, they're no longer here.

726
00:47:37.50 --> 00:47:39.50
I can't bring them back.

727
00:47:39.50 --> 00:47:42.50
What would they want me to be doing?

728
00:47:42.50 --> 00:47:44.50
What would make them proud?

729
00:47:44.50 --> 00:47:50.50
I take their life for granted if I use them as an excuse to be idle and fail.

730
00:47:50.50 --> 00:47:52.50
Right.

731
00:47:52.50 --> 00:47:54.50
But I am memorialized.

732
00:47:54.50 --> 00:48:00.50
And if I remember them speak their name and talk about them as I move on and I succeed.

733
00:48:00.50 --> 00:48:02.50
And I still think about that.

734
00:48:02.50 --> 00:48:05.50
I think about Ronnie Winchester who I played football with, who died now.

735
00:48:05.50 --> 00:48:06.50
Kaya, my rack.

736
00:48:06.50 --> 00:48:13.50
I think about Brett Harmon, who was killed at an NC State football tailgator before he could even lead his platoon to battle.

737
00:48:13.50 --> 00:48:16.50
And those incidents happen again while you're on the sidelines.

738
00:48:16.50 --> 00:48:21.50
And the other thing you start doing right now at that time period is, what is that saying?

739
00:48:21.50 --> 00:48:29.50
When the student is ready and instructor will appear, well, you ended up at the Marine Corps, the martial arts center for excellence and you started training.

740
00:48:29.50 --> 00:48:36.50
I ran into a Colonel named Joshusko, who is just this phenomenal guy, all about character.

741
00:48:36.50 --> 00:48:39.50
I mean, in his 60s, he's cut out run all of us.

742
00:48:39.50 --> 00:48:43.50
I mean, the epitome of discipline, discipline, discipline.

743
00:48:43.50 --> 00:48:49.50
And he brought me and I started working there and I got further introduced into martial arts.

744
00:48:49.50 --> 00:48:51.50
And I loved it.

745
00:48:51.50 --> 00:48:55.50
I found, hey, this is what I should be doing in my free time.

746
00:48:55.50 --> 00:48:57.50
I should be in heavy bags.

747
00:48:57.50 --> 00:48:58.50
I should be training.

748
00:48:58.50 --> 00:48:59.50
I should be watching tape.

749
00:48:59.50 --> 00:49:05.50
I need to be with, if I'm not reading military history and learning about my enemy, I'm doing this stuff.

750
00:49:05.50 --> 00:49:07.50
This, this is the type of stuff that's going to keep my mind sharp.

751
00:49:07.50 --> 00:49:08.50
And then I got intrigued.

752
00:49:08.50 --> 00:49:09.50
I wanted it.

753
00:49:09.50 --> 00:49:10.50
Okay.

754
00:49:10.50 --> 00:49:12.50
I'm going to lead Marines in combat.

755
00:49:12.50 --> 00:49:16.50
And a lot of these books that they were making is read on killing.

756
00:49:16.50 --> 00:49:20.50
And some of these books that that might paint your little off on the psychology of battle.

757
00:49:20.50 --> 00:49:21.50
A degree.

758
00:49:21.50 --> 00:49:23.50
I mean, just brutal guy.

759
00:49:23.50 --> 00:49:25.50
You're going to pee yourself before you get shot at.

760
00:49:25.50 --> 00:49:26.50
Actually, negative.

761
00:49:26.50 --> 00:49:27.50
I'm not going to pee myself.

762
00:49:27.50 --> 00:49:28.50
Yeah, I'm going to pee myself.

763
00:49:28.50 --> 00:49:28.50
Yeah.

764
00:49:28.50 --> 00:49:32.50
So I wondered, all right.

765
00:49:32.50 --> 00:49:34.50
Well, what can get me ready for that anxiety?

766
00:49:34.50 --> 00:49:35.50
I'm going to sign up for a fight.

767
00:49:35.50 --> 00:49:40.50
I had this master gunnery sergeant who was a really good kickboxer who worked at this martial arts center of exercise.

768
00:49:40.50 --> 00:49:42.50
So name, masterman, master guns.

769
00:49:42.50 --> 00:49:43.50
Will you train me for a fight?

770
00:49:43.50 --> 00:49:47.50
Can you get me like one of these martial arts fights on town?

771
00:49:47.50 --> 00:49:48.50
Yes, sir.

772
00:49:48.50 --> 00:49:49.50
I can get you one.

773
00:49:49.50 --> 00:49:50.50
You're going to show up.

774
00:49:50.50 --> 00:49:51.50
Yeah, of course.

775
00:49:51.50 --> 00:49:52.50
I'm going to show up.

776
00:49:52.50 --> 00:49:53.50
I don't know.

777
00:49:53.50 --> 00:49:56.50
Sir, I get a lot of you officers that don't.

778
00:49:56.50 --> 00:49:59.50
So anyways, I convinced him to train me every morning at five in the morning.

779
00:49:59.50 --> 00:50:00.50
We're training.

780
00:50:00.50 --> 00:50:01.50
It's six weeks.

781
00:50:01.50 --> 00:50:01.50
It's fine.

782
00:50:01.50 --> 00:50:03.50
I don't know much, right?

783
00:50:03.50 --> 00:50:07.50
I've got a black belt in the Marine Corps martial arts program.

784
00:50:07.50 --> 00:50:08.50
All right.

785
00:50:08.50 --> 00:50:11.50
That's an arm bar from the guard and arm bar from the mount.

786
00:50:11.50 --> 00:50:14.50
A sweet and how to escape the mount.

787
00:50:14.50 --> 00:50:16.50
I've never shrimped before.

788
00:50:16.50 --> 00:50:17.50
All right.

789
00:50:17.50 --> 00:50:19.50
I don't know what butterfly guard is.

790
00:50:19.50 --> 00:50:21.50
I have no clue what half guard is.

791
00:50:21.50 --> 00:50:22.50
All right.

792
00:50:22.50 --> 00:50:23.50
I've got a jab.

793
00:50:23.50 --> 00:50:25.50
I was a boss and I'll let you ready for your first MMA.

794
00:50:25.50 --> 00:50:26.50
And I'll let belt.

795
00:50:26.50 --> 00:50:27.50
You said.

796
00:50:27.50 --> 00:50:28.50
Huh?

797
00:50:28.50 --> 00:50:29.50
That was a black belt.

798
00:50:29.50 --> 00:50:30.50
I've got a jab across the leg.

799
00:50:30.50 --> 00:50:31.50
Understand.

800
00:50:31.50 --> 00:50:32.50
All right.

801
00:50:32.50 --> 00:50:33.50
So I get it.

802
00:50:33.50 --> 00:50:35.50
It's my first arms or fight.

803
00:50:35.50 --> 00:50:36.50
We weigh in.

804
00:50:36.50 --> 00:50:37.50
And the guy's older than me.

805
00:50:37.50 --> 00:50:39.50
He's got the same haircut as Chuck LaDell.

806
00:50:39.50 --> 00:50:40.50
And he's pretty ripped.

807
00:50:40.50 --> 00:50:42.50
And so you weigh in the same day as the fight.

808
00:50:42.50 --> 00:50:45.50
So we all leave now time to eat and then you come back.

809
00:50:45.50 --> 00:50:48.50
And so I come back and I'm warm up and he isn't showing up yet.

810
00:50:48.50 --> 00:50:52.50
Not only a little sheet that they hung off a bar in between us.

811
00:50:52.50 --> 00:50:54.50
And our fight's come up in two fights.

812
00:50:54.50 --> 00:50:55.50
And this guy may not show up.

813
00:50:55.50 --> 00:50:57.50
So this is the perfect scenario for me.

814
00:50:57.50 --> 00:50:58.50
He doesn't show.

815
00:50:58.50 --> 00:50:59.50
He was scared.

816
00:50:59.50 --> 00:51:02.50
I go out with all my Marine buddies in the crowd.

817
00:51:02.50 --> 00:51:03.50
I mean, there's 50 people at this fight.

818
00:51:03.50 --> 00:51:05.50
And 15 of them are there to watch me.

819
00:51:05.50 --> 00:51:07.50
And that makes it worse, right?

820
00:51:07.50 --> 00:51:09.50
And so he shows up.

821
00:51:09.50 --> 00:51:11.50
And he's warm and off.

822
00:51:11.50 --> 00:51:12.50
He's stretching.

823
00:51:12.50 --> 00:51:14.50
I'm like, look at through the sheet like, oh, maybe I need to do some of that to you.

824
00:51:14.50 --> 00:51:15.50
And I don't know.

825
00:51:15.50 --> 00:51:18.50
Anyways, we walked down his tarp.

826
00:51:18.50 --> 00:51:19.50
The fight starts.

827
00:51:19.50 --> 00:51:23.50
And this dude, he hits me with the worst spinning back fist.

828
00:51:23.50 --> 00:51:24.50
You've ever seen.

829
00:51:24.50 --> 00:51:26.50
I mean, slow motion off balance.

830
00:51:26.50 --> 00:51:27.50
My head's so big.

831
00:51:27.50 --> 00:51:28.50
Anything you throw at it.

832
00:51:28.50 --> 00:51:29.50
It hits any of my butt.

833
00:51:29.50 --> 00:51:30.50
He hits me with the spinning back fist.

834
00:51:30.50 --> 00:51:31.50
I'm starting to get embarrassed.

835
00:51:31.50 --> 00:51:33.50
He's coming at me aggressive.

836
00:51:33.50 --> 00:51:35.50
And now is that decision point.

837
00:51:35.50 --> 00:51:36.50
Okay.

838
00:51:36.50 --> 00:51:39.50
I can mentally break now and kind of cover up and get out of here.

839
00:51:39.50 --> 00:51:41.50
If this is a little uncomfortable for me.

840
00:51:41.50 --> 00:51:44.50
And at that point, I kind of snap.

841
00:51:44.50 --> 00:51:45.50
And I got mad.

842
00:51:45.50 --> 00:51:49.50
And so I go to try and take them down, which I am no less.

843
00:51:49.50 --> 00:51:50.50
He grabbed.

844
00:51:50.50 --> 00:51:51.50
He grabbed.

845
00:51:51.50 --> 00:51:52.50
He grabbed.

846
00:51:52.50 --> 00:51:54.50
He grabbed a big guillotine on me.

847
00:51:54.50 --> 00:51:55.50
Full on.

848
00:51:55.50 --> 00:51:56.50
Raps the legs around my waist.

849
00:51:56.50 --> 00:51:57.50
And he is hammered.

850
00:51:57.50 --> 00:51:59.50
Everything he's got here.

851
00:51:59.50 --> 00:52:01.50
He's tight.

852
00:52:01.50 --> 00:52:03.50
I'm making a few of the lights going on.

853
00:52:03.50 --> 00:52:04.50
I'm like, oh my goodness.

854
00:52:04.50 --> 00:52:05.50
No.

855
00:52:05.50 --> 00:52:08.50
And I could hear his corner man yelling to him.

856
00:52:08.50 --> 00:52:10.50
It's his wife.

857
00:52:10.50 --> 00:52:13.50
So now not only am I going to get tapped out in the first round.

858
00:52:13.50 --> 00:52:18.50
I'm going to get tapped out to a fake chocolate delby and corporat by his wife.

859
00:52:18.50 --> 00:52:19.50
Finish him, Jerry.

860
00:52:19.50 --> 00:52:20.50
I can do this.

861
00:52:20.50 --> 00:52:22.50
I can't let this happen.

862
00:52:22.50 --> 00:52:25.50
I find a way out of the choke.

863
00:52:25.50 --> 00:52:27.50
I kick him in the leg and realize, I kick hard.

864
00:52:27.50 --> 00:52:28.50
He didn't like that.

865
00:52:28.50 --> 00:52:29.50
And then I crack him in the forehead.

866
00:52:29.50 --> 00:52:30.50
And I split his head open.

867
00:52:30.50 --> 00:52:31.50
The doctor comes in.

868
00:52:31.50 --> 00:52:32.50
He doesn't know what month it is.

869
00:52:32.50 --> 00:52:34.50
And the fights over.

870
00:52:34.50 --> 00:52:37.50
And there was a bunch of Vietnam vets in the crowd.

871
00:52:37.50 --> 00:52:38.50
They're hammered.

872
00:52:38.50 --> 00:52:42.50
And as soon as I get out these dudes, these guys, these cross defellas throw their arms.

873
00:52:42.50 --> 00:52:44.50
I mean, spilling beer all over me.

874
00:52:44.50 --> 00:52:47.50
They're feeding me that, you know, they're putting the beer down my throat from their cup.

875
00:52:47.50 --> 00:52:48.50
They get dips in their mouth.

876
00:52:48.50 --> 00:52:50.50
I mean, this stuff is probably disgusting.

877
00:52:50.50 --> 00:52:53.50
But it takes so good.

878
00:52:53.50 --> 00:52:56.50
Ever that moment on, I was hooked.

879
00:52:56.50 --> 00:52:58.50
You know, this is what I should be doing.

880
00:52:58.50 --> 00:53:00.50
I had six weeks of a fight on my mind.

881
00:53:00.50 --> 00:53:07.50
If I can get used to that, how, how will I deal with the anxiety of, of unprepared for battle?

882
00:53:07.50 --> 00:53:10.50
Hey, we're on patrol, you know, we get contact.

883
00:53:10.50 --> 00:53:11.50
What's our media action?

884
00:53:11.50 --> 00:53:13.50
Well, we're going to have a major operation.

885
00:53:13.50 --> 00:53:14.50
Come to the six days.

886
00:53:14.50 --> 00:53:17.50
I have to be able to think clearly on the battlefield.

887
00:53:17.50 --> 00:53:20.50
Direct, lead, play chess.

888
00:53:20.50 --> 00:53:24.50
And so I thought, man, this fighting thing could be a key.

889
00:53:24.50 --> 00:53:25.50
It could be a help.

890
00:53:25.50 --> 00:53:28.50
And it certainly did not end up being that.

891
00:53:28.50 --> 00:53:32.50
But it ended up being my sanctuary through it all.

892
00:53:32.50 --> 00:53:34.50
It was, it was kind of what centered me.

893
00:53:34.50 --> 00:53:37.50
I brought tie pads to Iraq the first time.

894
00:53:37.50 --> 00:53:40.50
You know, I had one of my sergeants, the pretty good martial arts.

895
00:53:40.50 --> 00:53:41.50
We would train in between missions.

896
00:53:41.50 --> 00:53:42.50
I would train my guys.

897
00:53:42.50 --> 00:53:45.50
See, that's the difference between the seal teams and the Marine Corps.

898
00:53:45.50 --> 00:53:46.50
You brought tie pads?

899
00:53:46.50 --> 00:53:47.50
I brought mats.

900
00:53:47.50 --> 00:53:50.50
I mean, I had mats rooms.

901
00:53:50.50 --> 00:53:51.50
That's ridiculous.

902
00:53:51.50 --> 00:53:53.50
The budget is much, much different.

903
00:53:53.50 --> 00:53:54.50
Yeah, I know.

904
00:53:54.50 --> 00:53:56.50
It's like almost embarrassing for me to admit, you know.

905
00:53:56.50 --> 00:54:00.50
You also did a lot of wrestling drills with Travis Manion,

906
00:54:00.50 --> 00:54:02.50
who's one of your one of your buddies.

907
00:54:02.50 --> 00:54:04.50
And so he helped you out.

908
00:54:04.50 --> 00:54:12.50
And there's an interesting part in the book where you talk about you and Travis are going to

909
00:54:12.50 --> 00:54:14.50
Brett who you just talked about.

910
00:54:14.50 --> 00:54:15.50
You're going to his funeral.

911
00:54:15.50 --> 00:54:18.50
This is the guy with shot at some little scum full of stuff.

912
00:54:18.50 --> 00:54:19.50
It's a stay tailgather.

913
00:54:19.50 --> 00:54:20.50
There you go.

914
00:54:20.50 --> 00:54:22.50
Shot the chest and killed.

915
00:54:22.50 --> 00:54:25.50
You guys are going to his funeral.

916
00:54:25.50 --> 00:54:30.50
And the wrestling coach tells you guys to write your own

917
00:54:30.50 --> 00:54:34.50
ULIGIES for yourselves, for yourselves.

918
00:54:34.50 --> 00:54:36.50
Interesting drill.

919
00:54:36.50 --> 00:54:38.50
That's an interesting drill.

920
00:54:38.50 --> 00:54:43.50
Joel shared his head coach at the Naval Academy wrestling team right now.

921
00:54:43.50 --> 00:54:45.50
And it was wild.

922
00:54:45.50 --> 00:54:48.50
You know, so Brett Harmon was a Marine infantry officer.

923
00:54:48.50 --> 00:54:51.50
He was in third baton, second reign to which would be my eventual baton.

924
00:54:51.50 --> 00:54:55.50
When to an NC State football tailgather, there are some guys they're drinking and driving.

925
00:54:55.50 --> 00:54:57.50
And they almost hit a kid.

926
00:54:57.50 --> 00:55:00.50
And so they him and his buddy from Chicago, civilian,

927
00:55:00.50 --> 00:55:02.50
ran out from the car and stopped them and they got an argument.

928
00:55:02.50 --> 00:55:03.50
What are you guys doing?

929
00:55:03.50 --> 00:55:04.50
You guys are drunk.

930
00:55:04.50 --> 00:55:05.50
Should be driving the guys get out.

931
00:55:05.50 --> 00:55:06.50
They started to scuffle.

932
00:55:06.50 --> 00:55:07.50
Brett and his buddy won.

933
00:55:07.50 --> 00:55:08.50
Came back a couple hours later.

934
00:55:08.50 --> 00:55:10.50
Shot them both point blank.

935
00:55:10.50 --> 00:55:13.50
Shot Brett's buddy in the face and Brett went to get the gun from

936
00:55:13.50 --> 00:55:15.50
he got shot in the chest and they died.

937
00:55:15.50 --> 00:55:19.50
And so he was interesting because as we were writing this

938
00:55:19.50 --> 00:55:23.50
you will, you know, me and Travis, we were so close.

939
00:55:23.50 --> 00:55:27.50
And he was a fantastic wrestler and one of the toughest human beings I've ever known.

940
00:55:27.50 --> 00:55:30.50
I mean, what we used to do to each other was ridiculous training.

941
00:55:30.50 --> 00:55:34.50
I mean, if it is long as it was standing, I would, I would just destroy him.

942
00:55:34.50 --> 00:55:36.50
As soon as he got sick of that and wanted to tackle me on the ground,

943
00:55:36.50 --> 00:55:38.50
I wasn't getting up anymore and he was destroying me.

944
00:55:38.50 --> 00:55:41.50
But it would just go back and forth for hours.

945
00:55:41.50 --> 00:55:44.50
And instead of playing video game, drinking beer, going out and hitting on girls,

946
00:55:44.50 --> 00:55:48.50
that's what me and Travis would do on a Friday and Saturday night.

947
00:55:48.50 --> 00:55:51.50
And it was really tough when you really start to think,

948
00:55:51.50 --> 00:55:56.50
what do you want to be said when it's all over for you?

949
00:55:56.50 --> 00:55:59.50
How do you want to be remembered?

950
00:55:59.50 --> 00:56:03.50
And I remember Travis, he really struggled with this.

951
00:56:03.50 --> 00:56:04.50
Struggle.

952
00:56:04.50 --> 00:56:06.50
I mean, he was so loud talking about that.

953
00:56:06.50 --> 00:56:07.50
It reels in the plane.

954
00:56:07.50 --> 00:56:08.50
It was weird.

955
00:56:08.50 --> 00:56:10.50
And part of it was because we were just struggling with the fact that,

956
00:56:10.50 --> 00:56:12.50
you know, our friend is dead.

957
00:56:12.50 --> 00:56:15.50
You know, for such a weird circumstance.

958
00:56:15.50 --> 00:56:18.50
Yeah, we could understand if it was an idea or a sniper or something like that.

959
00:56:18.50 --> 00:56:19.50
And not this.

960
00:56:19.50 --> 00:56:25.50
And, you know, several years later, it was wild.

961
00:56:25.50 --> 00:56:29.50
But, you know, Joel shared when he would give Travis his eulogy.

962
00:56:29.50 --> 00:56:31.50
He brought that story up.

963
00:56:31.50 --> 00:56:33.50
Travis would get killed in Felicia.

964
00:56:33.50 --> 00:56:36.50
And I remember driving up the Travis's funeral.

965
00:56:36.50 --> 00:56:40.50
And, you know, Travis is one of those guys that you just,

966
00:56:40.50 --> 00:56:42.50
you just, you just, you just never, he can't die.

967
00:56:42.50 --> 00:56:43.50
He's just too bad.

968
00:56:43.50 --> 00:56:44.50
He's too tough.

969
00:56:44.50 --> 00:56:46.50
He's too smart, too good.

970
00:56:46.50 --> 00:56:49.50
So, remember driving up the funeral and I had my wife there with me.

971
00:56:49.50 --> 00:56:52.50
And she was actually trying to make plans for their twin sister.

972
00:56:52.50 --> 00:56:53.50
Hey, we're going to be in town.

973
00:56:53.50 --> 00:56:54.50
We lived in North Carolina.

974
00:56:54.50 --> 00:56:55.50
Let's get together this weekend.

975
00:56:55.50 --> 00:56:58.50
But her twin sister's husband didn't want to get together.

976
00:56:58.50 --> 00:57:00.50
There was a part of me that didn't,

977
00:57:00.50 --> 00:57:01.50
Travis isn't dead.

978
00:57:01.50 --> 00:57:02.50
Like, I'm going to get there.

979
00:57:02.50 --> 00:57:04.50
And we're all going to hang out tonight.

980
00:57:04.50 --> 00:57:07.50
And I remember when I walked into that wake and I actually saw him.

981
00:57:07.50 --> 00:57:10.50
I mean, it hit me like a ton of bricks.

982
00:57:10.50 --> 00:57:11.50
It was brutal.

983
00:57:11.50 --> 00:57:15.50
I loved that guy so much.

984
00:57:15.50 --> 00:57:17.50
And we carried him the next day.

985
00:57:17.50 --> 00:57:21.50
But, you know, it's just, it's so crazy how connected it was because

986
00:57:21.50 --> 00:57:27.50
Ronnie Winchester died and I'll kind of my rack.

987
00:57:27.50 --> 00:57:33.50
And three days later, Brett Harmon died at that NC State football game.

988
00:57:33.50 --> 00:57:37.50
We would go to Brett Harmon's funeral,

989
00:57:37.50 --> 00:57:41.50
right around Ulligis, with Joel shared who had then ended up giving Travis

990
00:57:41.50 --> 00:57:43.50
Manion his actual Ulligis.

991
00:57:43.50 --> 00:57:45.50
And I would carry Travis to his grave.

992
00:57:45.50 --> 00:57:49.50
I went to Alkai, my rack, and actually replaced Ronnie's

993
00:57:49.50 --> 00:57:53.50
Platoon and turned over with the replacement Platoon commander who took over

994
00:57:53.50 --> 00:57:55.50
for him when he passed.

995
00:57:55.50 --> 00:57:59.50
While I was an infantry officer, course, J.P. Blacksmith was killed in

996
00:57:59.50 --> 00:58:00.50
Flusion.

997
00:58:00.50 --> 00:58:05.50
And I got this a little lot of work, but when J.P. died,

998
00:58:05.50 --> 00:58:09.50
I found out, right before I had my last amateur fight, I was an infantry officer

999
00:58:09.50 --> 00:58:10.50
course.

1000
00:58:10.50 --> 00:58:13.50
And I'm getting ready to fight in two hours for a title.

1001
00:58:13.50 --> 00:58:15.50
Travis Manion was my quarter-man.

1002
00:58:15.50 --> 00:58:19.50
And we're in the hotel room and he got a call and he looked like he had seen a ghost.

1003
00:58:19.50 --> 00:58:20.50
Like, Travis was wrong.

1004
00:58:20.50 --> 00:58:23.50
He was nothing to do, I'll tell you, for the fight.

1005
00:58:23.50 --> 00:58:26.50
And we had gotten, as like, no, I know something's up.

1006
00:58:26.50 --> 00:58:27.50
What the hell happened?

1007
00:58:27.50 --> 00:58:30.50
Travis told me, and do J.P. Blacksmith got killed in Flusion.

1008
00:58:30.50 --> 00:58:32.50
So Travis tells me by J.P.'s death,

1009
00:58:32.50 --> 00:58:36.50
I turned over with J.P.'s company, my second tour.

1010
00:58:36.50 --> 00:58:38.50
And so I met all of his old Marines, all of his old

1011
00:58:38.50 --> 00:58:40.50
old and old and old and old and old and old and old and old.

1012
00:58:40.50 --> 00:58:44.50
It's such a small world that we lived in breed then.

1013
00:58:44.50 --> 00:58:46.50
You know, and so in my little platoon commanders,

1014
00:58:46.50 --> 00:58:48.50
notebook, I had pictures of all of them.

1015
00:58:48.50 --> 00:58:50.50
And before every mission I would flip through,

1016
00:58:50.50 --> 00:58:53.50
and you just think, how do I make them proud?

1017
00:58:53.50 --> 00:58:58.50
Before every fight, I would look at their pictures and look at the picture of my Marines.

1018
00:58:58.50 --> 00:58:59.50
How do I make them proud?

1019
00:58:59.50 --> 00:59:02.50
And I still think about it to this day.

1020
00:59:02.50 --> 00:59:05.50
And I end a lot of my speeches on this.

1021
00:59:05.50 --> 00:59:08.50
You know, they no longer have the chance to live.

1022
00:59:08.50 --> 00:59:10.50
Who am I to take this life for granted?

1023
00:59:10.50 --> 00:59:13.50
Because they would give anything to have one more day.

1024
00:59:13.50 --> 00:59:16.50
Their families would give anything to have one more day.

1025
00:59:16.50 --> 00:59:19.50
And I try to remind myself of that all the time.

1026
00:59:19.50 --> 00:59:22.50
And you don't have to serve the military to think like that.

1027
00:59:22.50 --> 00:59:24.50
People will look into, well, that's extreme.

1028
00:59:24.50 --> 00:59:26.50
Well, who have you lost in your life?

1029
00:59:26.50 --> 00:59:27.50
What would make them proud?

1030
00:59:27.50 --> 00:59:29.50
How do you truly memorialize them?

1031
00:59:29.50 --> 00:59:31.50
It's certainly not through failure.

1032
00:59:31.50 --> 00:59:33.50
It's not through being idle in life.

1033
00:59:33.50 --> 00:59:36.50
Live a life of substance, not just existence.

1034
00:59:36.50 --> 00:59:40.50
And that, you know, as you do that, and you remember them,

1035
00:59:40.50 --> 00:59:41.50
that makes them proud.

1036
00:59:41.50 --> 00:59:43.50
That makes it worth it.

1037
00:59:43.50 --> 00:59:47.50
You know, it's very similar to that final scene in saving private Ryan.

1038
00:59:47.50 --> 00:59:49.50
Where he's like, did I earn it?

1039
00:59:49.50 --> 00:59:52.50
You know, and for those of us who served and were in those great circumstances,

1040
00:59:52.50 --> 00:59:54.50
or for those people, there's people that were in tragedies,

1041
00:59:54.50 --> 00:59:55.50
where they were in car accidents.

1042
00:59:55.50 --> 00:59:56.50
They lost people.

1043
00:59:56.50 --> 00:59:57.50
They think the same way.

1044
00:59:57.50 --> 01:00:00.50
They think a lot the way they do that we do when we look at life

1045
01:00:00.50 --> 01:00:05.50
and taking things for granted and achieving everyday and adding value.

1046
01:00:05.50 --> 01:00:11.50
Yeah, the darkness in the world, regardless of where you are.

1047
01:00:11.50 --> 01:00:15.50
You, you know, speaking of your combat tours,

1048
01:00:15.50 --> 01:00:18.50
I want to kind of dive into those a little bit.

1049
01:00:18.50 --> 01:00:21.50
And let's take you.

1050
01:00:21.50 --> 01:00:24.50
You take over your platoon, your platoon commander now.

1051
01:00:24.50 --> 01:00:27.50
Back to the book here.

1052
01:00:27.50 --> 01:00:32.50
During our first platoon meeting, my introductory speech lasted less than two minutes.

1053
01:00:32.50 --> 01:00:34.50
We're going to be aggressive.

1054
01:00:34.50 --> 01:00:35.50
I told my new command.

1055
01:00:35.50 --> 01:00:37.50
We're going to train our asses off.

1056
01:00:37.50 --> 01:00:41.50
And we're going to be, and we're going to work harder than anyone else in the battalion.

1057
01:00:41.50 --> 01:00:43.50
That was it.

1058
01:00:43.50 --> 01:00:46.50
Short to the point, all business.

1059
01:00:46.50 --> 01:00:49.50
What's more, they found out quickly.

1060
01:00:49.50 --> 01:00:51.50
I wasn't kidding.

1061
01:00:51.50 --> 01:00:55.50
So you, you guys work hard.

1062
01:00:55.50 --> 01:00:56.50
You get prepared.

1063
01:00:56.50 --> 01:00:59.50
You deploy to Alkaiim, which you just talked about.

1064
01:00:59.50 --> 01:01:01.50
That's where you ended up going.

1065
01:01:01.50 --> 01:01:04.50
And I'm jumping ahead a little bit.

1066
01:01:04.50 --> 01:01:06.50
People are going to have to read this whole book themselves.

1067
01:01:06.50 --> 01:01:11.50
But you're basically now setting up a position on a bridge.

1068
01:01:11.50 --> 01:01:16.50
You're kind of a blocking force and this bridge is prevent any me from consolidating on another area.

1069
01:01:16.50 --> 01:01:19.50
Where there's another operation going on.

1070
01:01:19.50 --> 01:01:21.50
And I'm going to the book.

1071
01:01:21.50 --> 01:01:23.50
Mortars began to fall on our position.

1072
01:01:23.50 --> 01:01:27.50
As we fought back, I made sure that our vehicles moved from one spot to another.

1073
01:01:27.50 --> 01:01:29.50
So the mortar crews would not zero in on us.

1074
01:01:29.50 --> 01:01:35.50
From a waddy that ran perpendicular to route, emerald, several insurgents began lobbying.

1075
01:01:35.50 --> 01:01:37.50
Rocket propelled grenades at us.

1076
01:01:37.50 --> 01:01:39.50
The rockets exploded all around us.

1077
01:01:39.50 --> 01:01:41.50
Then another heavy machine gun let loose.

1078
01:01:41.50 --> 01:01:43.50
This one cited on the north bank as well.

1079
01:01:43.50 --> 01:01:46.50
We were caught in a 180 degree crossfire.

1080
01:01:46.50 --> 01:01:50.50
From my window I could see Corporal Delitor and Bravo 1.

1081
01:01:50.50 --> 01:01:58.50
They were taking the brunt of the fire and Delitor briefly dipped out of the turret as bullets bounced off the home of these armored skin.

1082
01:01:58.50 --> 01:02:03.50
Then I saw his hand pop up above the blast shield holding a video camera.

1083
01:02:03.50 --> 01:02:06.50
It takes a rare kind of cool to do something like that.

1084
01:02:06.50 --> 01:02:12.50
In combat, an infantry platoon's first task to achieve fire superiority over the enemy.

1085
01:02:12.50 --> 01:02:18.50
To do this requires pouring it on the insurgents until they are forced to either disengage or go to ground.

1086
01:02:18.50 --> 01:02:26.50
Once they're even driven off, either driven off or pinned in place, you've gained command of the fight and can dictate what happens next.

1087
01:02:26.50 --> 01:02:39.50
Even with the tanks, as I failed to mention, you had some tanks from army tanks with you and you throughout the book have the same deep love for tanks that I have.

1088
01:02:39.50 --> 01:02:43.50
For army tanks, marine tanks, but I love tanks.

1089
01:02:43.50 --> 01:02:48.50
Even with the tanks, in this case, we didn't have the fire power to gain control of this battle.

1090
01:02:48.50 --> 01:02:52.50
There were too many insurgents shooting at us from too many different places.

1091
01:02:52.50 --> 01:02:53.50
We needed some help.

1092
01:02:53.50 --> 01:02:57.50
I reach for the radio's headset, began calling air strikes within minutes.

1093
01:02:57.50 --> 01:03:04.50
Huey Cobb Regunships thundered in on scene to deliver deadly accurate health fire missiles and targets we identified.

1094
01:03:04.50 --> 01:03:10.50
So was this situation here? Was that like your first big combat scenario?

1095
01:03:10.50 --> 01:03:18.50
It was. It was. And the thing that made it so difficult was there was another platoon assigned for that mission.

1096
01:03:18.50 --> 01:03:19.50
Right.

1097
01:03:19.50 --> 01:03:21.50
And they got stuck in the mud.

1098
01:03:21.50 --> 01:03:22.50
They got stuck in the mud.

1099
01:03:22.50 --> 01:03:23.50
They got stuck in the mud.

1100
01:03:23.50 --> 01:03:27.50
And so we didn't get the opportunity to aerial reconnaissance.

1101
01:03:27.50 --> 01:03:31.50
We didn't have the opportunity to look at overhead imagery of this terrain.

1102
01:03:31.50 --> 01:03:36.50
We had nothing. I had 15 minutes. Hey, if they're not there in 15 minutes, you're a go.

1103
01:03:36.50 --> 01:03:40.50
So in that 15 minutes, I'm briefing my guys. We're getting ready.

1104
01:03:40.50 --> 01:03:43.50
We're now we're meeting this tank crew from Boise, Idaho.

1105
01:03:43.50 --> 01:03:45.50
We've never even met them. I met them the day before.

1106
01:03:45.50 --> 01:03:47.50
My guys had never worked with them before.

1107
01:03:47.50 --> 01:03:52.50
So there was a lot of confusion that took place just in the route up.

1108
01:03:52.50 --> 01:03:56.50
And as we got settled and started identifying targets, and as you know,

1109
01:03:56.50 --> 01:04:02.50
in that scenario, the acoustics and in the movement, the amount of people,

1110
01:04:02.50 --> 01:04:07.50
we are the most precise military in the history of this planet.

1111
01:04:07.50 --> 01:04:12.50
So we not only have to identify where is the gunfire coming from?

1112
01:04:12.50 --> 01:04:16.50
What caliber do I believe they're firing back or at us with?

1113
01:04:16.50 --> 01:04:21.50
Because that dictates what caliber I'm allowed to return fire with.

1114
01:04:21.50 --> 01:04:24.50
Depending on where they're shooting at me from,

1115
01:04:24.50 --> 01:04:27.50
are they in a dug-in position or at the river?

1116
01:04:27.50 --> 01:04:30.50
Or are they shooting at me from a building where they're civilians around?

1117
01:04:30.50 --> 01:04:32.50
Are they shooting at me from a waddy?

1118
01:04:32.50 --> 01:04:35.50
Where now I can drop hell fires on them. I can hit them with tanks.

1119
01:04:35.50 --> 01:04:39.50
That's a lot going through your head when you've got four vehicles,

1120
01:04:39.50 --> 01:04:43.50
two tanks and aircraft you're trying to control as a 24 year old kid.

1121
01:04:43.50 --> 01:04:46.50
And everybody's waiting on you to say what's coming next.

1122
01:04:46.50 --> 01:04:51.50
Just like in every vehicle, there's another kid in there directing everything they're doing.

1123
01:04:51.50 --> 01:04:56.50
And that is all part of it. That was our first, our first time.

1124
01:04:56.50 --> 01:05:00.50
When Deletory, I don't put in the book, but when I said to him over the radio,

1125
01:05:00.50 --> 01:05:04.50
I mean, I verbally almost killed him through the radio for doing it.

1126
01:05:04.50 --> 01:05:05.50
That wild son of a bitch.

1127
01:05:05.50 --> 01:05:09.50
I've told this story on the podcast, but this I had a similar story.

1128
01:05:09.50 --> 01:05:12.50
I'll tell it again right now because Mikey Montzor, who ended up

1129
01:05:12.50 --> 01:05:18.50
getting killed in Ramadi, metal vonder, I went to his little station where he was.

1130
01:05:18.50 --> 01:05:22.50
And the guy was like, hey, did you see Mikey's video? And I was like, no, let me see your video.

1131
01:05:22.50 --> 01:05:26.50
And he goes, oh, Mikey was a heavy weapon, it's gone.

1132
01:05:26.50 --> 01:05:28.50
And carried the mark 48.

1133
01:05:28.50 --> 01:05:31.50
And so I go back into his little worm camp, Carregard, or in Ramadi.

1134
01:05:31.50 --> 01:05:33.50
I go back into his little kuchi, a built from south of him.

1135
01:05:33.50 --> 01:05:35.50
Like Mikey, let me see your video.

1136
01:05:35.50 --> 01:05:38.50
And he goes, oh, Roger that, sir. So he pulls out his little camera.

1137
01:05:38.50 --> 01:05:39.50
And he shows the video.

1138
01:05:39.50 --> 01:05:44.50
And there's a massive fire fight going on in the moolob district of Ramadi.

1139
01:05:44.50 --> 01:05:46.50
And he's got the camera up.

1140
01:05:46.50 --> 01:05:49.50
And you can see it ducked out and go up. He's filming everything.

1141
01:05:49.50 --> 01:05:53.50
And he gets done showing me. And at one point in the video, he turns the camera

1142
01:05:53.50 --> 01:05:58.50
himself and he goes, it's the moolob, which was just classic Mikey.

1143
01:05:58.50 --> 01:06:01.50
And so he gets done. And of course, I'm all hardcore.

1144
01:06:01.50 --> 01:06:05.50
And I go, hey, Mikey, bro, what are you doing out there?

1145
01:06:05.50 --> 01:06:10.50
You're in a firefight. You need to be on your pig gun, getting rounds down and killing bad guys.

1146
01:06:10.50 --> 01:06:15.50
He's like, sir, I'm sorry, I was, I was windchester.

1147
01:06:15.50 --> 01:06:19.50
He had no more people like me. He had to dump the thousand rounds.

1148
01:06:19.50 --> 01:06:22.50
And I was like, all right, Mikey, you're good. You know, that you're fine.

1149
01:06:22.50 --> 01:06:24.50
You can see it all you want if you go windchester.

1150
01:06:24.50 --> 01:06:28.50
But yeah, I was like, you probably worked too out.

1151
01:06:28.50 --> 01:06:29.50
Oh, no, I didn't. I was about that.

1152
01:06:29.50 --> 01:06:32.50
I was so mad. So mad.

1153
01:06:32.50 --> 01:06:35.50
Another thing, let me just give you this prompt.

1154
01:06:35.50 --> 01:06:39.50
And you're going to hear this too when you, when you get off this podcast and people

1155
01:06:39.50 --> 01:06:42.50
going to hit you up on social media, you're going to hear from young, so you're going

1156
01:06:42.50 --> 01:06:47.50
to hear from soldiers and Marines that are going to ask you questions because they listen to this.

1157
01:06:47.50 --> 01:06:49.50
And they get knowledge from it.

1158
01:06:49.50 --> 01:06:54.50
Is there anything that you didn't expect that you wish somebody would have told you

1159
01:06:54.50 --> 01:07:00.50
going into that first firefight for someone that's in basic training right now or at the basic school right now?

1160
01:07:00.50 --> 01:07:03.50
Anything that you piece of advice you'd give them?

1161
01:07:03.50 --> 01:07:06.50
Yeah, you know, a few things.

1162
01:07:06.50 --> 01:07:09.50
You know, one, don't go in there.

1163
01:07:09.50 --> 01:07:18.50
Guns a blazing right away because in, in that circumstance, the sound is actually one of your better indicators or where the gunfire is coming from.

1164
01:07:18.50 --> 01:07:22.50
Because when that heat is blazing, you're not going to see a muzzle flash.

1165
01:07:22.50 --> 01:07:24.50
It just doesn't exist, right?

1166
01:07:24.50 --> 01:07:32.50
The other thing is when you, when you are keeping your vehicles mobile, that doesn't allow you to lock in on a T&E system with a heavy machine gun.

1167
01:07:32.50 --> 01:07:37.50
So you've got to be smart in the increments that you move in and the formations you move in

1168
01:07:37.50 --> 01:07:40.50
and make sure that your, your machine gunners have drilled that.

1169
01:07:40.50 --> 01:07:41.50
That's what we would do drill.

1170
01:07:41.50 --> 01:07:47.50
We would do T&E drills till my guy's hands blood and not just that the primary machine gun or everybody in that truck.

1171
01:07:47.50 --> 01:07:52.50
So if one goes down the other comes up so that when we moved them, they can quickly get back on that same target.

1172
01:07:52.50 --> 01:07:58.50
Because basically what that became a game of is you suppress that position with a 240 golfer, medium machine gun,

1173
01:07:58.50 --> 01:08:01.50
until I can talk the tanks on and then the tanks, they don't miss.

1174
01:08:01.50 --> 01:08:02.50
It's all computer.

1175
01:08:02.50 --> 01:08:03.50
It's like a video game.

1176
01:08:03.50 --> 01:08:08.50
And we dug in positions just aim a little bit lower and watch the shit fly and excuse my language.

1177
01:08:08.50 --> 01:08:14.50
But that was one of the problems when we went in and we started receiving some gunfire.

1178
01:08:14.50 --> 01:08:18.50
Everybody started shooting firework and identified with, but then also we're getting shot from other positions.

1179
01:08:18.50 --> 01:08:24.50
We can't really tell because of the acoustics until somebody actually hits a way to get hit for back here too.

1180
01:08:24.50 --> 01:08:27.50
And then some of the increments my drivers would move in.

1181
01:08:27.50 --> 01:08:32.50
They moved so much that it was no longer a small adjustment on the T&E for that machine gunner.

1182
01:08:32.50 --> 01:08:37.50
Now they've got to get out of the turret exposing themselves to work that thing in.

1183
01:08:37.50 --> 01:08:42.50
And because of collateral damage, you can't just work it in, send some rounds down the range.

1184
01:08:42.50 --> 01:08:45.50
Oops, I hit the building 10 feet away. You're not allowed to do that.

1185
01:08:45.50 --> 01:08:49.50
You've got to get that sucker into where you see it on the site and then you can start sending rounds down.

1186
01:08:49.50 --> 01:08:53.50
Well, that guy gets to shoot at you because you're so concerned with collateral damage.

1187
01:08:53.50 --> 01:08:58.50
And so, drill, drill, drill.

1188
01:08:58.50 --> 01:09:02.50
Because a mortar drop in on the top of a Humvee is not a good thing.

1189
01:09:02.50 --> 01:09:05.50
And they are more accurate than you realize.

1190
01:09:05.50 --> 01:09:11.50
These, the enemy out there has been launched in mortars and indirect fire for decades,

1191
01:09:11.50 --> 01:09:18.50
where you get a little bit of ammo to do it on range 400 out in the, out in the palms for Marines that is.

1192
01:09:18.50 --> 01:09:20.50
These guys get to do it every day for real.

1193
01:09:20.50 --> 01:09:23.50
Yeah, and you know what, they don't even have to be good. They get lucky one time.

1194
01:09:23.50 --> 01:09:28.50
And, and human life doesn't mean anything to them, but it means everything does.

1195
01:09:28.50 --> 01:09:32.50
So they get lucky one time. And there's, there's, that's the way it goes.

1196
01:09:32.50 --> 01:09:34.50
That's the way combat is.

1197
01:09:34.50 --> 01:09:35.50
Um,

1198
01:09:39.50 --> 01:09:44.50
So you get done with that and, and,

1199
01:09:44.50 --> 01:09:47.50
tank hits an IED.

1200
01:09:47.50 --> 01:09:54.50
You need to find out what's going on. And basically there's a, there's a burning Abrams here going on.

1201
01:09:54.50 --> 01:09:58.50
Um, suddenly a huge explosion drowned out all other battle sounds.

1202
01:09:58.50 --> 01:10:02.50
The ground rolled and shook as if the fault line had suddenly collapsed beneath us.

1203
01:10:02.50 --> 01:10:06.50
A head of maelstrom of sand, dirt, smoke, and flames, boiled skyward.

1204
01:10:06.50 --> 01:10:10.50
Before I could even ask Sergeant Peterson's voice came over the radio,

1205
01:10:10.50 --> 01:10:11.50
mortar hit one of the tanks.

1206
01:10:11.50 --> 01:10:13.50
My column break to stop.

1207
01:10:13.50 --> 01:10:19.50
The explosion morphed into a dry into a small dirty brown mushroom cloud over,

1208
01:10:19.50 --> 01:10:22.50
South Sergeant plunkies M1.

1209
01:10:22.50 --> 01:10:26.50
No way a mortar did that. That had to have been an massive IED.

1210
01:10:26.50 --> 01:10:28.50
Luke Miller called over to me.

1211
01:10:28.50 --> 01:10:30.50
I have no calms of them.

1212
01:10:30.50 --> 01:10:33.50
So now you radio for a meta-vac. You're trying to find out what's going on.

1213
01:10:33.50 --> 01:10:35.50
The tanks on fire.

1214
01:10:35.50 --> 01:10:36.50
And here we go back to the book.

1215
01:10:36.50 --> 01:10:39.50
I took a deep breath and ran for the burning Abrams.

1216
01:10:39.50 --> 01:10:44.50
I took only a few steps before I saw Robertson frantically waving back at me.

1217
01:10:44.50 --> 01:10:46.50
Wait, I'm sorry, waving me back.

1218
01:10:46.50 --> 01:10:50.50
Just then a line of bullets stitched across the sand about ten feet ahead of me.

1219
01:10:50.50 --> 01:10:55.50
I executed my best football shuttle run and dashed back for cover.

1220
01:10:55.50 --> 01:11:01.50
Bravo three laid down suppressing fire which allowed me to get across the open space

1221
01:11:01.50 --> 01:11:02.50
on my second attempt.

1222
01:11:02.50 --> 01:11:04.50
So let's cover and move another thing.

1223
01:11:04.50 --> 01:11:05.50
Chapter in the book.

1224
01:11:05.50 --> 01:11:06.50
So I talk about all the time.

1225
01:11:06.50 --> 01:11:08.50
This is the fundamental.

1226
01:11:08.50 --> 01:11:11.50
That's what it is. Cover move.

1227
01:11:11.50 --> 01:11:13.50
Then you guys are doing it right here.

1228
01:11:13.50 --> 01:11:16.50
When I reached Robertson he shouted, we still got two wounded in there.

1229
01:11:16.50 --> 01:11:18.50
We had to get them out quickly.

1230
01:11:18.50 --> 01:11:19.50
I climbed onto the tank.

1231
01:11:19.50 --> 01:11:21.50
Miller following a short time later.

1232
01:11:21.50 --> 01:11:23.50
The incoming fire was heavy and more than once.

1233
01:11:23.50 --> 01:11:25.50
We had to duck behind the turret.

1234
01:11:25.50 --> 01:11:30.50
So getting your game on Bryan stand.

1235
01:11:30.50 --> 01:11:31.50
Yeah.

1236
01:11:31.50 --> 01:11:37.50
The funny thing about it was I was trying to maintain a low profile when I got on the tank.

1237
01:11:37.50 --> 01:11:40.50
There's little micro things you can hide behind.

1238
01:11:40.50 --> 01:11:45.50
And the drivers that the person deepest in that thing.

1239
01:11:45.50 --> 01:11:49.50
And we couldn't get him out. He was the last one and he was a bigger guy.

1240
01:11:49.50 --> 01:11:51.50
And I'm trying to lift him. I'm a strong dude.

1241
01:11:51.50 --> 01:11:55.50
I lifted way to a racquet man was a strong bigger guy than I am right now.

1242
01:11:55.50 --> 01:11:56.50
Couldn't get him out.

1243
01:11:56.50 --> 01:11:59.50
And I couldn't understand why and he's looking at me.

1244
01:11:59.50 --> 01:12:01.50
He's got blood all means like why is this taking so long.

1245
01:12:01.50 --> 01:12:03.50
And he doesn't say it that clear.

1246
01:12:03.50 --> 01:12:04.50
I mean he's out of it.

1247
01:12:04.50 --> 01:12:07.50
I didn't know at the time he was paralyzed from the chest down there.

1248
01:12:07.50 --> 01:12:10.50
And so I realized you only when I'm getting him out.

1249
01:12:10.50 --> 01:12:12.50
It's if I get my legs underneath me.

1250
01:12:12.50 --> 01:12:14.50
And that's going to create a target.

1251
01:12:14.50 --> 01:12:16.50
And so.

1252
01:12:16.50 --> 01:12:19.50
You think sometimes we think some silly things in combat.

1253
01:12:19.50 --> 01:12:21.50
And I just thought, look, if I'm going to get shot by these guys.

1254
01:12:21.50 --> 01:12:23.50
What's the last thing I want them to see before they hit me?

1255
01:12:23.50 --> 01:12:24.50
And that's my rear end.

1256
01:12:24.50 --> 01:12:28.50
So when I hopped up, I faced that rate towards a foot.

1257
01:12:28.50 --> 01:12:30.50
I honestly think I think would save me.

1258
01:12:30.50 --> 01:12:33.50
You know, you'll talk to people that hunt.

1259
01:12:33.50 --> 01:12:37.50
And they tell me when they get that perfect buck in their sights.

1260
01:12:37.50 --> 01:12:38.50
Huge rack.

1261
01:12:38.50 --> 01:12:42.50
And it's such an easy shot, but they're so excited that they pull the shot and they miss.

1262
01:12:42.50 --> 01:12:47.50
Well, when I've got a Kevlar helmet on.

1263
01:12:47.50 --> 01:12:50.50
I look who seems spaceball.

1264
01:12:50.50 --> 01:12:51.50
Oh yeah.

1265
01:12:51.50 --> 01:12:53.50
I mean, you can see right now it's just the head.

1266
01:12:53.50 --> 01:12:59.50
When I got a Kevlar on, I mean, if someone's trying to snipe me or they're trying to shoot

1267
01:12:59.50 --> 01:13:03.50
the mini machine gun and they see they're like, oh man, I got this dude.

1268
01:13:03.50 --> 01:13:04.50
They missed.

1269
01:13:04.50 --> 01:13:06.50
And I squires, they were pulling them up.

1270
01:13:06.50 --> 01:13:11.50
And we literally, you know, we almost collapse off the tank and land on top of another guy

1271
01:13:11.50 --> 01:13:12.50
and got them down.

1272
01:13:12.50 --> 01:13:16.50
But the whole thing I could think of, I mean, obviously great when we landed.

1273
01:13:16.50 --> 01:13:17.50
Hey, I don't think I got shot.

1274
01:13:17.50 --> 01:13:18.50
Did you get hit?

1275
01:13:18.50 --> 01:13:19.50
He didn't get hit.

1276
01:13:19.50 --> 01:13:21.50
And we were able to get them all.

1277
01:13:21.50 --> 01:13:23.50
But that was that was the thing happened.

1278
01:13:23.50 --> 01:13:25.50
Sometimes you just get lucky.

1279
01:13:25.50 --> 01:13:27.50
And I think I presented such a big target.

1280
01:13:27.50 --> 01:13:28.50
Whoever was behind that trigger.

1281
01:13:28.50 --> 01:13:29.50
Just straight.

1282
01:13:29.50 --> 01:13:30.50
Get looted.

1283
01:13:30.50 --> 01:13:32.50
Yeah, that's a tight merit to you.

1284
01:13:32.50 --> 01:13:37.50
I'll tell you when when this enemy sees a downed vehicle, it is like a bullet magnet.

1285
01:13:37.50 --> 01:13:41.50
The fact that you survived that is ridiculous.

1286
01:13:41.50 --> 01:13:46.50
And yeah, it must, it's a miracle and luck and everything else because when the enemy

1287
01:13:46.50 --> 01:13:50.50
sees a target like that, man, they just pour fire onto it because they know there's

1288
01:13:50.50 --> 01:13:52.50
creating a total catastrophic situation for us.

1289
01:13:52.50 --> 01:13:54.50
And they almost always have a camera on it too.

1290
01:13:54.50 --> 01:13:55.50
Yeah.

1291
01:13:55.50 --> 01:13:56.50
The they are there.

1292
01:13:56.50 --> 01:13:57.50
That was pop up on film.

1293
01:13:57.50 --> 01:13:59.50
It didn't, I couldn't find it.

1294
01:13:59.50 --> 01:14:04.50
But they study film like NFL teams study film and sometimes you find their footage where

1295
01:14:04.50 --> 01:14:05.50
they didn't even attack you.

1296
01:14:05.50 --> 01:14:09.50
They're just watching what your response was to see what they're going to do next.

1297
01:14:09.50 --> 01:14:13.50
People underestimate the evil and the detail that they go through.

1298
01:14:13.50 --> 01:14:18.50
Maybe I'll make this sniper decided to delete that video because he was going to get so much trouble

1299
01:14:18.50 --> 01:14:19.50
for this in the beginning.

1300
01:14:19.50 --> 01:14:20.50
Yeah.

1301
01:14:20.50 --> 01:14:22.50
The big shit in America.

1302
01:14:22.50 --> 01:14:24.50
He's like, how did you miss this guy?

1303
01:14:24.50 --> 01:14:25.50
Look at the size of the head.

1304
01:14:25.50 --> 01:14:33.50
So you call in actually you call in helicopters.

1305
01:14:33.50 --> 01:14:36.50
They come in under fire.

1306
01:14:36.50 --> 01:14:38.50
Don't take any hits.

1307
01:14:38.50 --> 01:14:39.50
I'm not sure.

1308
01:14:39.50 --> 01:14:40.50
I still haven't.

1309
01:14:40.50 --> 01:14:44.50
I've not been able to find who was flying that he was.

1310
01:14:44.50 --> 01:14:46.50
I never was able to find out.

1311
01:14:46.50 --> 01:14:49.50
And I mean, I wish I could.

1312
01:14:49.50 --> 01:14:54.50
That guy who landed because a whole squad was taking out a few clicks to our east and there was no

1313
01:14:54.50 --> 01:14:56.50
back birds in this guy.

1314
01:14:56.50 --> 01:15:00.50
I mean, we laid down the butterfly trigger so that he could land but man, he showed some guts.

1315
01:15:00.50 --> 01:15:01.50
He would have been fired.

1316
01:15:01.50 --> 01:15:04.50
Had they got hit and had that halo going down, but he didn't care.

1317
01:15:04.50 --> 01:15:09.50
He knew there was a Marine there that needed to get out and need to get out now or else he was done.

1318
01:15:09.50 --> 01:15:13.50
And he landed got him and lifted off and I never saw him again.

1319
01:15:13.50 --> 01:15:15.50
I'm telling you that that's a real hit.

1320
01:15:15.50 --> 01:15:16.50
That was a Marine Corps.

1321
01:15:16.50 --> 01:15:19.50
It was a Marine Corps pilot in a hewie of all things.

1322
01:15:19.50 --> 01:15:20.50
A hewie.

1323
01:15:20.50 --> 01:15:22.50
That took some stones.

1324
01:15:22.50 --> 01:15:25.50
And I wish I could find that person.

1325
01:15:25.50 --> 01:15:27.50
Well, if I hear this podcast, reach out.

1326
01:15:27.50 --> 01:15:29.50
I hope so.

1327
01:15:29.50 --> 01:15:32.50
Now, you get that back to base.

1328
01:15:32.50 --> 01:15:37.50
Hela's just run and you guys get back.

1329
01:15:37.50 --> 01:15:38.50
Yeah, great.

1330
01:15:38.50 --> 01:15:41.50
We survived and then you get re-tasked.

1331
01:15:41.50 --> 01:15:47.50
You got to go bring Emma, weapons, or sorry, Emma, water fuel back up there.

1332
01:15:47.50 --> 01:15:52.50
And this was an interesting.

1333
01:15:52.50 --> 01:15:55.50
I got this and I kind of brought it up earlier, but back to the book.

1334
01:15:55.50 --> 01:16:05.50
Just before we rolled out my Alpha section arrived back at Alkaim after a very dull day covering the jump off point for the assault force task with crossing the afraidies.

1335
01:16:05.50 --> 01:16:08.50
They encountered no opposition.

1336
01:16:08.50 --> 01:16:15.50
And my Bravo section marines quickly busted out the stories of our busy day much to the jealousy of the rest of the platoon.

1337
01:16:15.50 --> 01:16:18.50
So what I was trying to explain earlier.

1338
01:16:18.50 --> 01:16:22.50
So these guys, you know, these guys are an crazy firefight.

1339
01:16:22.50 --> 01:16:23.50
Almost get killed.

1340
01:16:23.50 --> 01:16:24.50
They got guys getting wounded.

1341
01:16:24.50 --> 01:16:25.50
They come back.

1342
01:16:25.50 --> 01:16:28.50
The other other squad had no action.

1343
01:16:28.50 --> 01:16:29.50
And what are they?

1344
01:16:29.50 --> 01:16:30.50
They're jealous.

1345
01:16:30.50 --> 01:16:31.50
And Matt.

1346
01:16:31.50 --> 01:16:37.50
Alpha section was so full of aggressive angry marines who wanted nothing more to get into the fight.

1347
01:16:37.50 --> 01:16:41.50
They lobbied to go out on this run, but I vetoed the idea.

1348
01:16:41.50 --> 01:16:46.50
Sergeant Pete's men knew the terrain now and we needed that experience to shepherd the two trucks to the bridge.

1349
01:16:46.50 --> 01:16:49.50
I told my Alpha section that I had plenty of opportunities in the days to come,

1350
01:16:49.50 --> 01:16:54.50
but I knew as we left the wire they remained on the base frustrated and anxious.

1351
01:16:54.50 --> 01:16:58.50
That's just tells you what the Marine Corps is all about.

1352
01:16:58.50 --> 01:16:59.50
Heated me that night.

1353
01:16:59.50 --> 01:17:02.50
I'm sure heated me.

1354
01:17:02.50 --> 01:17:04.50
And then, okay, so you do that.

1355
01:17:04.50 --> 01:17:05.50
That's another hell run.

1356
01:17:05.50 --> 01:17:07.50
And again, I'm not going to read your entire book.

1357
01:17:07.50 --> 01:17:10.50
People can buy this book and read it.

1358
01:17:10.50 --> 01:17:14.50
But when you get back again, another just crazy run.

1359
01:17:14.50 --> 01:17:19.50
When you get back, that's what you got to go back to the bridge again.

1360
01:17:19.50 --> 01:17:21.50
That's good times.

1361
01:17:21.50 --> 01:17:23.50
So here you go.

1362
01:17:23.50 --> 01:17:24.50
Back to the book.

1363
01:17:24.50 --> 01:17:25.50
We're going back to the bridge tonight.

1364
01:17:25.50 --> 01:17:26.50
I started.

1365
01:17:26.50 --> 01:17:28.50
Alpha, it's out of the last couple of fights.

1366
01:17:28.50 --> 01:17:30.50
They were fresh and eager and ready to go in the fray.

1367
01:17:30.50 --> 01:17:33.50
Right now, Bravo section had all the bragging rights.

1368
01:17:33.50 --> 01:17:36.50
And that was driving Francis's men nuts.

1369
01:17:36.50 --> 01:17:39.50
When I broke the news, I liked this part.

1370
01:17:39.50 --> 01:17:42.50
When I broke the news, I saw no fear in anyone's eyes.

1371
01:17:42.50 --> 01:17:45.50
Just anticipation and excitement.

1372
01:17:45.50 --> 01:17:47.50
Be careful what you wish for.

1373
01:17:47.50 --> 01:17:49.50
I thought.

1374
01:17:49.50 --> 01:17:54.50
So again, Marines are fired up to go.

1375
01:17:54.50 --> 01:17:58.50
And you go out again.

1376
01:17:58.50 --> 01:18:01.50
And this one again goes sideways.

1377
01:18:01.50 --> 01:18:03.50
You're using up all your nine.

1378
01:18:03.50 --> 01:18:05.50
Oh man, this one got ugly quick.

1379
01:18:05.50 --> 01:18:07.50
And, you know, we expected it too.

1380
01:18:07.50 --> 01:18:10.50
But there was things working against us a little bit in that.

1381
01:18:10.50 --> 01:18:11.50
We had to go up there.

1382
01:18:11.50 --> 01:18:16.50
They tank that had to catastrophic kill days earlier.

1383
01:18:16.50 --> 01:18:17.50
We had to go up there and recover.

1384
01:18:17.50 --> 01:18:19.50
You can't leave that in the battlefield.

1385
01:18:19.50 --> 01:18:24.50
And so I had never even, I'd never know what a Mike 88 recovery vehicle was.

1386
01:18:24.50 --> 01:18:26.50
I learned that in Ramadhi as well.

1387
01:18:26.50 --> 01:18:29.50
It's a tank with no guns.

1388
01:18:29.50 --> 01:18:32.50
And it's a mechanic vehicle.

1389
01:18:32.50 --> 01:18:35.50
They go fix the other tank or they tell them.

1390
01:18:35.50 --> 01:18:38.50
And so we were going to meet a tank section.

1391
01:18:38.50 --> 01:18:42.50
So two regular Abrams tanks plus this Mike 88 tank recovery vehicle.

1392
01:18:42.50 --> 01:18:44.50
In the middle of the desert.

1393
01:18:44.50 --> 01:18:45.50
Here's your grid.

1394
01:18:45.50 --> 01:18:46.50
We'll meet there.

1395
01:18:46.50 --> 01:18:48.50
I'm going to kick my order there.

1396
01:18:48.50 --> 01:18:50.50
I've never even met these Marines before.

1397
01:18:50.50 --> 01:18:53.50
Hey, by the way, here's your introduction to my Alpha section.

1398
01:18:53.50 --> 01:18:54.50
By the way, too.

1399
01:18:54.50 --> 01:18:57.50
We're going to head straight north and try and catch them to my surprise.

1400
01:18:57.50 --> 01:18:59.50
And get right up to the bridge.

1401
01:18:59.50 --> 01:19:02.50
But I told them, look, this area has been heavily guarded.

1402
01:19:02.50 --> 01:19:04.50
So be prepared.

1403
01:19:04.50 --> 01:19:07.50
Well, this master started who's driving the Mike 88.

1404
01:19:07.50 --> 01:19:08.50
Let's me know.

1405
01:19:08.50 --> 01:19:11.50
Hey, sir, just seeing no once we get on that asphalt.

1406
01:19:11.50 --> 01:19:16.50
This thing only going to go about 10 miles an hour at best.

1407
01:19:16.50 --> 01:19:17.50
What?

1408
01:19:17.50 --> 01:19:18.50
As you start to wait.

1409
01:19:18.50 --> 01:19:19.50
One.

1410
01:19:19.50 --> 01:19:21.50
We're good on sand.

1411
01:19:21.50 --> 01:19:24.50
But we don't go very fast on on asphalt.

1412
01:19:24.50 --> 01:19:26.50
Like, well, you don't want to go on sand.

1413
01:19:26.50 --> 01:19:28.50
You know what they bury in sand for us.

1414
01:19:28.50 --> 01:19:30.50
And what they have wait for us there.

1415
01:19:30.50 --> 01:19:33.50
So men, we hit the line of departure.

1416
01:19:33.50 --> 01:19:35.50
And they opened up on us.

1417
01:19:35.50 --> 01:19:39.50
And that Mike 88 just crawling crawling.

1418
01:19:39.50 --> 01:19:43.50
And my section leader Steph Saren France, his vehicle,

1419
01:19:43.50 --> 01:19:45.50
gets hit with an RPG.

1420
01:19:45.50 --> 01:19:46.50
Just missed by an IED.

1421
01:19:46.50 --> 01:19:48.50
But the back of the vehicles on fire.

1422
01:19:48.50 --> 01:19:52.50
And when we're getting hit, the tanks start returning fire.

1423
01:19:52.50 --> 01:19:57.50
And here's another really good lesson for young officers and just young

1424
01:19:57.50 --> 01:19:58.50
service members in general.

1425
01:19:58.50 --> 01:20:01.50
When you're fighting at night and you've got night vision goggles on.

1426
01:20:01.50 --> 01:20:04.50
And tanks are returning fire into these buildings.

1427
01:20:04.50 --> 01:20:05.50
Right?

1428
01:20:05.50 --> 01:20:06.50
They were shooting down on us in these buildings.

1429
01:20:06.50 --> 01:20:07.50
Shooting us through windows.

1430
01:20:07.50 --> 01:20:08.50
The tanks are identical.

1431
01:20:08.50 --> 01:20:10.50
We're identifying targets and they're taking them out.

1432
01:20:10.50 --> 01:20:11.50
The debris.

1433
01:20:11.50 --> 01:20:12.50
It's heavy.

1434
01:20:12.50 --> 01:20:15.50
The material that these buildings are made of.

1435
01:20:15.50 --> 01:20:17.50
It's very heavy and it blinds us.

1436
01:20:17.50 --> 01:20:20.50
Couldn't see now because all the damage the tanks did.

1437
01:20:20.50 --> 01:20:22.50
And my lead vehicle blew the turn.

1438
01:20:22.50 --> 01:20:24.50
Back of the vehicles on fire.

1439
01:20:24.50 --> 01:20:25.50
They blow the turn.

1440
01:20:25.50 --> 01:20:28.50
So we all blow the turn and link back up.

1441
01:20:28.50 --> 01:20:29.50
And now as I look down the blockhead,

1442
01:20:29.50 --> 01:20:31.50
I can see these lights blinking.

1443
01:20:31.50 --> 01:20:36.50
Which typically tells us it's signaling an ambush that are expecting us to go that route.

1444
01:20:36.50 --> 01:20:38.50
It's an adecision time.

1445
01:20:38.50 --> 01:20:40.50
And you've got to be quick.

1446
01:20:40.50 --> 01:20:42.50
So at that time, we're about to work in a headless.

1447
01:20:42.50 --> 01:20:43.50
Turn the combat around.

1448
01:20:43.50 --> 01:20:46.50
Let's hit the turn where we know we're going to get right to the people that need us.

1449
01:20:46.50 --> 01:20:47.50
Right to that down tank.

1450
01:20:47.50 --> 01:20:48.50
Let's fight our way through this kills.

1451
01:20:48.50 --> 01:20:50.50
Only we call it some air strikes.

1452
01:20:50.50 --> 01:20:52.50
That time is when they let loose those suicide vehicles.

1453
01:20:52.50 --> 01:20:54.50
And one got through our perimeter.

1454
01:20:54.50 --> 01:20:55.50
And man.

1455
01:20:55.50 --> 01:21:00.50
I've, one of the Marines actually filmed that explosion.

1456
01:21:00.50 --> 01:21:04.50
And man, just a horrible family.

1457
01:21:04.50 --> 01:21:05.50
I heard that explosion.

1458
01:21:05.50 --> 01:21:07.50
I just, the first thing went through my head.

1459
01:21:07.50 --> 01:21:09.50
I just got five kids killed immediately.

1460
01:21:09.50 --> 01:21:12.50
It's the first thing that went through my head.

1461
01:21:12.50 --> 01:21:15.50
Radio silence and everybody's waiting for there's no crying.

1462
01:21:15.50 --> 01:21:16.50
There's no mourning.

1463
01:21:16.50 --> 01:21:17.50
There's no time out.

1464
01:21:17.50 --> 01:21:19.50
There's no haystacks or enrovers and you take over.

1465
01:21:19.50 --> 01:21:20.50
No.

1466
01:21:20.50 --> 01:21:24.50
I mean, after that thought, my next, my next thing needs to be me giving orders out of my mouth.

1467
01:21:24.50 --> 01:21:28.50
And moving people forward because we don't have time to mourn right now.

1468
01:21:28.50 --> 01:21:31.50
And, and so immediately I set a perimeter with the tanks.

1469
01:21:31.50 --> 01:21:35.50
I establish which vehicles going to be the tow vehicle for our down vehicle where the casualty's going to go.

1470
01:21:35.50 --> 01:21:38.50
Where's the quorum and I get out of my vehicle and I push that's what leaders do.

1471
01:21:38.50 --> 01:21:39.50
We go to the point of friction.

1472
01:21:39.50 --> 01:21:41.50
Where's the point of friction?

1473
01:21:41.50 --> 01:21:42.50
And that was my vehicle.

1474
01:21:42.50 --> 01:21:44.50
Let's just hit with the suicide vehicle.

1475
01:21:44.50 --> 01:21:46.50
Man, I get there.

1476
01:21:46.50 --> 01:21:53.50
And on top of it is this 22 year old kid Jeff Lampson who's built like a number two pencil.

1477
01:21:53.50 --> 01:21:54.50
Right?

1478
01:21:54.50 --> 01:21:57.50
He was just in this vehicle.

1479
01:21:57.50 --> 01:22:00.50
I mean, this vehicle is destroyed.

1480
01:22:00.50 --> 01:22:02.50
How he's conscious, I don't know.

1481
01:22:02.50 --> 01:22:08.50
But he's on top of it pulling our gun or out of the turret who's got a piece of shrapnel in his head bigger than that book.

1482
01:22:08.50 --> 01:22:12.50
Everybody in the vehicles, everybody's wounded.

1483
01:22:12.50 --> 01:22:15.50
But staffs aren't France comes out in the whole side of his face as melton.

1484
01:22:15.50 --> 01:22:17.50
He's like, sir, we're going to be good.

1485
01:22:17.50 --> 01:22:19.50
We're going to be, I was never more relieved in my life.

1486
01:22:19.50 --> 01:22:21.50
There's still getting shot at.

1487
01:22:21.50 --> 01:22:24.50
France is basically walking, but he's not totally conscious yet.

1488
01:22:24.50 --> 01:22:26.50
There's like bullets in the garden.

1489
01:22:26.50 --> 01:22:31.50
Like I got a grab and put it behind the vehicle for a second because he's on it, of course.

1490
01:22:31.50 --> 01:22:41.50
But man, to see Lampson, this kid who actually had a little bit of an attitude at the time with one of the guys I had to correct an awful lot.

1491
01:22:41.50 --> 01:22:42.50
He's a little too long.

1492
01:22:42.50 --> 01:22:44.50
He tried to grow a mustache and I thought a peach fuzz.

1493
01:22:44.50 --> 01:22:46.50
I mean, he's a kid.

1494
01:22:46.50 --> 01:22:50.50
You look at the, I mean, you would never imagine that this is a warrior, but in this time of need,

1495
01:22:50.50 --> 01:22:59.50
I'm telling you man, he was saving lives and it was so humbling and so motivating to see that.

1496
01:22:59.50 --> 01:23:02.50
And we were able to, we got everybody in that mic 88.

1497
01:23:02.50 --> 01:23:07.50
Eventually got the toe got out of there and I mean, we called in a massive air strike and we won.

1498
01:23:07.50 --> 01:23:09.50
But we didn't pitch a shut up.

1499
01:23:09.50 --> 01:23:10.50
That's for sure.

1500
01:23:10.50 --> 01:23:16.50
And in the hardest part of that was when all my casualties are loaded on, you have, we're not doctors.

1501
01:23:16.50 --> 01:23:17.50
We have no idea.

1502
01:23:17.50 --> 01:23:20.50
When you see a guy with Shrapnel out of his brain like that, you think they're done.

1503
01:23:20.50 --> 01:23:25.50
So my Marines, they think we may have lost two or three of these folks and they're down.

1504
01:23:25.50 --> 01:23:29.50
And as far as I know, we're out there to fight from the three, four, five.

1505
01:23:29.50 --> 01:23:31.50
That was gas right that had.

1506
01:23:31.50 --> 01:23:35.50
What was the Shrapnel said was he was he walking wounded was he.

1507
01:23:35.50 --> 01:23:37.50
So he would, he would come to.

1508
01:23:37.50 --> 01:23:40.50
He got shot as Lampson was pulling him out of the turret.

1509
01:23:40.50 --> 01:23:44.50
He got shot again in the elbow as we were pulling him out.

1510
01:23:44.50 --> 01:23:48.50
And we got him in the meta-vac and he was just he was, I remember he was he was cursive.

1511
01:23:48.50 --> 01:23:49.50
I can't believe I let them get us.

1512
01:23:49.50 --> 01:23:50.50
I can't believe I let them get us.

1513
01:23:50.50 --> 01:23:51.50
I can't believe I let them get us.

1514
01:23:51.50 --> 01:23:53.50
Blame themself for the suicide vehicle getting to the vehicle.

1515
01:23:53.50 --> 01:23:55.50
And I told him, yes, it's my fault.

1516
01:23:55.50 --> 01:23:56.50
It's not your fault.

1517
01:23:56.50 --> 01:23:58.50
And, but at least he was talking.

1518
01:23:58.50 --> 01:23:59.50
Yeah.

1519
01:23:59.50 --> 01:24:03.50
But I mean, this, you know, this is pretty freaky.

1520
01:24:03.50 --> 01:24:06.50
When you see a piece of metal and someone's head just like this.

1521
01:24:06.50 --> 01:24:07.50
And I don't mean he couldn't see himself.

1522
01:24:07.50 --> 01:24:09.50
And I didn't know anybody wanted to tell him.

1523
01:24:09.50 --> 01:24:12.50
Nobody wanted to say hey, reach up and touch with his in your brain right now.

1524
01:24:12.50 --> 01:24:14.50
But he was gone.

1525
01:24:14.50 --> 01:24:16.50
I mean, once he left that day, we didn't see him in the rest of the deployment.

1526
01:24:16.50 --> 01:24:19.50
I didn't see him until I had gotten back.

1527
01:24:19.50 --> 01:24:21.50
And the craziest thing is,

1528
01:24:21.50 --> 01:24:29.50
we reunited for an episode of Ultimate Insider with the UFC.

1529
01:24:29.50 --> 01:24:32.50
And I didn't really know what they were after.

1530
01:24:32.50 --> 01:24:37.50
And this, this producer, you know, asked me if I could get this guy there.

1531
01:24:37.50 --> 01:24:38.50
You're going to do a story.

1532
01:24:38.50 --> 01:24:41.50
It was really going to be honorable to him, this and that.

1533
01:24:41.50 --> 01:24:42.50
And it was, right?

1534
01:24:42.50 --> 01:24:45.50
But at the same time he's sitting this next to each other and he's asking this Marine.

1535
01:24:45.50 --> 01:24:48.50
Hey, do you blame Brian Stan for this happening?

1536
01:24:48.50 --> 01:24:50.50
Do you blame this for hat?

1537
01:24:50.50 --> 01:24:53.50
I mean, it was, it was dark and it was difficult.

1538
01:24:53.50 --> 01:24:56.50
It was, it was hard for both of us, man, because, you know, for gas,

1539
01:24:56.50 --> 01:24:58.50
he lived, right?

1540
01:24:58.50 --> 01:25:00.50
And, and he's got a family now, but the amount of headaches,

1541
01:25:00.50 --> 01:25:03.50
the piercing headaches, this man struggles with.

1542
01:25:03.50 --> 01:25:05.50
You know, in and out of coms, trying to text him.

1543
01:25:05.50 --> 01:25:08.50
I don't know what, you know, where's numbers at?

1544
01:25:08.50 --> 01:25:12.50
Um, he's a great warrior, great dude.

1545
01:25:12.50 --> 01:25:14.50
But the pain he lives with every day.

1546
01:25:14.50 --> 01:25:15.50
I mean, this never going away.

1547
01:25:15.50 --> 01:25:18.50
He had, I think, four brain surgeries after that.

1548
01:25:18.50 --> 01:25:20.50
Four brain surgeries.

1549
01:25:20.50 --> 01:25:21.50
Unbelievable.

1550
01:25:21.50 --> 01:25:24.50
And he was blaming himself crazy.

1551
01:25:24.50 --> 01:25:26.50
Warriors.

1552
01:25:26.50 --> 01:25:31.50
And you know, you, you kind of wrap up that here.

1553
01:25:31.50 --> 01:25:33.50
Going back to the book.

1554
01:25:33.50 --> 01:25:39.50
Our unit, three two Marines is known as the Betel Bastards in 1943,

1555
01:25:39.50 --> 01:25:45.50
the Betelian took part in Operation Galvanic, the invasion of Tarlah.

1556
01:25:45.50 --> 01:25:54.50
Betelio Island was the main target of the landing force and the Marines faced an entrenched enemy with pre-registered fields of fire on the beaches.

1557
01:25:54.50 --> 01:25:56.50
Pleas you don't know what that is.

1558
01:25:56.50 --> 01:26:02.50
That's an actual nightmare when the enemy already knows where their rounds are going to go.

1559
01:26:02.50 --> 01:26:04.50
Where their rounds are going to land when they fire them.

1560
01:26:04.50 --> 01:26:06.50
This is a worst case scenario.

1561
01:26:06.50 --> 01:26:10.50
The first assault waves were nearly wiped out by machine gunner mortar fires.

1562
01:26:10.50 --> 01:26:12.50
They waited through the lagoon onto the narrow beach.

1563
01:26:12.50 --> 01:26:20.50
It took 76 hours to clear the island, which was barely 2,000 yards long and a few score wide.

1564
01:26:20.50 --> 01:26:29.50
Over 3,000 Marines and sailors died or fell wounded during what became the most ferocious close quarter battle ever fought by the United States Marine Corps.

1565
01:26:29.50 --> 01:26:40.50
That was the legacy of my unit, a legacy of determination, heroism, and stoic resolve in the face of unimaginable adversity.

1566
01:26:40.50 --> 01:26:47.50
On May 10th, 2008, my Marines proved they were cut from the same cloth.

1567
01:26:47.50 --> 01:26:51.50
Indeed.

1568
01:26:51.50 --> 01:26:57.50
It's so humbling when you watch these young men from all different walks of life.

1569
01:26:57.50 --> 01:27:04.50
Some of them only citizens in the United States for a couple years at that point really diverse backgrounds.

1570
01:27:04.50 --> 01:27:06.50
It's not a gang full of white people.

1571
01:27:06.50 --> 01:27:07.50
It's very diverse.

1572
01:27:07.50 --> 01:27:09.50
They don't care.

1573
01:27:09.50 --> 01:27:17.50
Man, when they're getting shot at, there is nobody ducking for cover.

1574
01:27:17.50 --> 01:27:18.50
Nobody.

1575
01:27:18.50 --> 01:27:20.50
They are getting after it.

1576
01:27:20.50 --> 01:27:24.50
They're love and care for one another for the mission.

1577
01:27:24.50 --> 01:27:27.50
For people trying to destroy their way of life.

1578
01:27:27.50 --> 01:27:30.50
It's awe-inspiring to watch their selfless acts.

1579
01:27:30.50 --> 01:27:32.50
I mean, what they'll do.

1580
01:27:32.50 --> 01:27:38.50
And this was more obviously direct engagement against an enemy.

1581
01:27:38.50 --> 01:27:45.50
But I've seen them just like Lampson was willing to sacrifice himself to save Robert Gas.

1582
01:27:45.50 --> 01:27:51.50
I've seen Marines do the same to save innocent Iraqi kids.

1583
01:27:51.50 --> 01:27:55.50
The same care that they had for one another.

1584
01:27:55.50 --> 01:27:57.50
They had for the people that they were there to protect.

1585
01:27:57.50 --> 01:28:01.50
And that gets lost a lot when people talk about these wars.

1586
01:28:01.50 --> 01:28:06.50
It's become cool to paint our military like we're this brutal force.

1587
01:28:06.50 --> 01:28:11.50
That's wiped out all these people in these different countries.

1588
01:28:11.50 --> 01:28:19.50
These were men who were such great professionals, but under the most extreme circumstances.

1589
01:28:19.50 --> 01:28:22.50
Understood that they could lose their life.

1590
01:28:22.50 --> 01:28:25.50
And that was 100% acceptable to them.

1591
01:28:25.50 --> 01:28:27.50
If that meant saving the guy next to him.

1592
01:28:27.50 --> 01:28:29.50
And that.

1593
01:28:29.50 --> 01:28:35.50
It's hard for me to meet somebody like Michael Strahan or football player, famous person.

1594
01:28:35.50 --> 01:28:36.50
All impressive people.

1595
01:28:36.50 --> 01:28:38.50
But it's hard for me to meet someone like that.

1596
01:28:38.50 --> 01:28:41.50
And be like, oh my god, can I get a picture for Instagram?

1597
01:28:41.50 --> 01:28:46.50
When you've been around 19, 21, 20-year-old kids.

1598
01:28:46.50 --> 01:28:49.50
And these kids don't come from rich backgrounds.

1599
01:28:49.50 --> 01:28:52.50
They didn't have a whole lot.

1600
01:28:52.50 --> 01:28:55.50
There was a reason when our nation was in two wars.

1601
01:28:55.50 --> 01:28:59.50
They decided to sign up and be infantry in the Marine Corps.

1602
01:28:59.50 --> 01:29:05.50
They will forever be the greatest people I've ever been surrounded with.

1603
01:29:05.50 --> 01:29:10.50
Yeah, you know, I talk about that all the time.

1604
01:29:10.50 --> 01:29:14.50
The fact that when we were in Ramadhi specifically.

1605
01:29:14.50 --> 01:29:21.50
You know, here we were the special operations guys, the Navy SEALs, whatever.

1606
01:29:21.50 --> 01:29:24.50
We all of us, all of us guys.

1607
01:29:24.50 --> 01:29:32.50
We just had such admiration and love for the Marine Corps.

1608
01:29:32.50 --> 01:29:36.50
And for the Army soldiers that we work with, those guys, like you said.

1609
01:29:36.50 --> 01:29:41.50
And for us, we're sitting there, we're going, man, we've got infinitely more training.

1610
01:29:41.50 --> 01:29:44.50
infinitely more training than a grunt has.

1611
01:29:44.50 --> 01:29:45.50
That's just the way it is.

1612
01:29:45.50 --> 01:29:46.50
Absolutely.

1613
01:29:46.50 --> 01:29:47.50
Like you talk about the budget.

1614
01:29:47.50 --> 01:29:52.50
We used to shoot more rounds in a week than a Marine Corps company.

1615
01:29:52.50 --> 01:29:54.50
We're shooting their work up, no kidding.

1616
01:29:54.50 --> 01:29:56.50
Like we saw the numbers.

1617
01:29:56.50 --> 01:29:58.50
So we get infinitely more training.

1618
01:29:58.50 --> 01:30:00.50
We get better gear.

1619
01:30:00.50 --> 01:30:05.50
And yet you go down to the government center in Ramadhi.

1620
01:30:05.50 --> 01:30:07.50
You go down to Cop Falcon.

1621
01:30:07.50 --> 01:30:13.50
And you look at those soldiers and Marines that are getting after it every day.

1622
01:30:13.50 --> 01:30:17.50
And that's why we just had nothing but the utmost highest respect for those guys.

1623
01:30:17.50 --> 01:30:18.50
And they knew it.

1624
01:30:18.50 --> 01:30:20.50
That was nasty fighting down there too.

1625
01:30:20.50 --> 01:30:21.50
Yeah.

1626
01:30:21.50 --> 01:30:22.50
Nasty fighting in Ramadhi.

1627
01:30:22.50 --> 01:30:23.50
Yeah.

1628
01:30:23.50 --> 01:30:30.50
I'm going to take us back to the book here.

1629
01:30:30.50 --> 01:30:34.50
An Amtrak, a lightly armored amphibious vehicle, first-puttune,

1630
01:30:34.50 --> 01:30:39.50
three, two, five, struck a landmine only a few hundred meters from our position.

1631
01:30:39.50 --> 01:30:42.50
So this is another operation that you're out on.

1632
01:30:42.50 --> 01:30:45.50
And this is where we started this day off.

1633
01:30:45.50 --> 01:30:52.50
We heard the explosion saw the smoke and flames rising behind us and then heard the cries for help over the radio.

1634
01:30:52.50 --> 01:30:54.50
We couldn't go to their aid.

1635
01:30:54.50 --> 01:30:56.50
The bridge had not yet been cleared.

1636
01:30:56.50 --> 01:30:59.50
And we were almost certain had it been mined by the enemy.

1637
01:30:59.50 --> 01:31:04.30
Besides, we couldn't leave our blocking position without exposing the left-hand

1638
01:31:04.30 --> 01:31:05.30
left-flank.

1639
01:31:05.30 --> 01:31:11.82
The track burned as three, two, five's fellow Marines and my friend and mentor Lieutenant

1640
01:31:11.82 --> 01:31:19.30
Diana from our weapons company, frantically tried to free the men trapped inside.

1641
01:31:19.30 --> 01:31:24.30
Inside Alpha 3, I could see this color drained from my men's faces.

1642
01:31:24.30 --> 01:31:27.30
They looked absolutely stricken.

1643
01:31:27.30 --> 01:31:33.30
Then the tracks ready ammunition began cooking off.

1644
01:31:33.30 --> 01:31:37.30
With each detonation, I could see my men flinch.

1645
01:31:37.30 --> 01:31:39.30
I ordered everyone to face south.

1646
01:31:39.30 --> 01:31:43.30
I didn't want my men to see what was unfolding.

1647
01:31:43.30 --> 01:31:48.30
Hearing it over the radio was bad enough.

1648
01:31:48.30 --> 01:31:50.30
Five Marines died inside the track.

1649
01:31:50.30 --> 01:31:54.30
Everyone else inside suffered wounds of varying degrees.

1650
01:31:54.30 --> 01:31:56.30
The driver was pulled from the wreckage.

1651
01:31:56.30 --> 01:31:58.30
His face bloody and missing teeth.

1652
01:31:58.30 --> 01:32:01.30
The explosion at slammed his head against the vehicles front console.

1653
01:32:01.30 --> 01:32:04.30
Another Marine emerged with his uniform on fire.

1654
01:32:04.30 --> 01:32:10.30
Quick thinking men nearby got him on the ground and put the flames out with a fire extinguisher.

1655
01:32:10.30 --> 01:32:18.30
All my experiences in combat, this is the one that haunts me the most, the feeling of complete impotence

1656
01:32:18.30 --> 01:32:26.30
in the face of such a profound tragedy scarred us all that day.

1657
01:32:26.30 --> 01:32:31.30
A Gabe Diana had actually served in Leema 325.

1658
01:32:31.30 --> 01:32:33.30
It's a reserve unit out of Columbus, Ohio.

1659
01:32:33.30 --> 01:32:39.30
Before he became active duty and then became an officer, he was in elicited with 325.

1660
01:32:39.30 --> 01:32:44.30
I remember when we were starting this operation in 325 came to our base.

1661
01:32:44.30 --> 01:32:47.30
He was bringing some of these guys.

1662
01:32:47.30 --> 01:32:49.30
Hey man, he grew up with them.

1663
01:32:49.30 --> 01:32:51.30
These were his brothers.

1664
01:32:51.30 --> 01:32:56.30
Now they were firefighters, they were police officers all brought together for this mission.

1665
01:32:56.30 --> 01:32:59.30
Man, it was brutal.

1666
01:32:59.30 --> 01:33:00.30
Absolutely brutal.

1667
01:33:00.30 --> 01:33:08.30
I remember hearing a story about this woman from Columbus who they had lost.

1668
01:33:08.30 --> 01:33:13.30
I think it was over 20, it was around 22 Marines from Leema 325 during that deployment.

1669
01:33:13.30 --> 01:33:18.30
And she decided to paint these beautiful murals at murals of each one.

1670
01:33:18.30 --> 01:33:23.30
They were so nice at the Marine Corps Museum for a while, put them right in their foyer.

1671
01:33:23.30 --> 01:33:27.30
They just heard you walk into the museum there, they were in their big.

1672
01:33:27.30 --> 01:33:33.30
I remember hearing a story and then I was doing a shoot with the UFC in the Marine Corps.

1673
01:33:33.30 --> 01:33:38.30
When the Marine Corps is advertising with the UFC and part of the shoot was going to be us as fighters.

1674
01:33:38.30 --> 01:33:40.30
And then with the Marines going to the Marine Corps Museum.

1675
01:33:40.30 --> 01:33:45.30
I was both sides of the fence and we walked in and they were there.

1676
01:33:45.30 --> 01:33:48.30
And I didn't know I didn't expect it.

1677
01:33:48.30 --> 01:33:52.30
And it was really tough because here I am, you know, I'm around these Marines and I'm around, you know,

1678
01:33:52.30 --> 01:33:55.30
some of my buddies shot at it and it's four-ish Griffin were there.

1679
01:33:55.30 --> 01:33:59.30
And as soon as I walked in, man, my eyes filled up with tears.

1680
01:33:59.30 --> 01:34:05.30
You know, getting up to meet some of these men very briefly then we set off and go.

1681
01:34:05.30 --> 01:34:11.30
And because of my relationship with Gabe Diana, who was my mentor at the time and knowing what he went through that day,

1682
01:34:11.30 --> 01:34:16.30
childhood brothers of his and him also being helpless.

1683
01:34:16.30 --> 01:34:19.30
And nothing's fair in combat.

1684
01:34:19.30 --> 01:34:20.30
We know that.

1685
01:34:20.30 --> 01:34:21.30
Nothing's fair.

1686
01:34:21.30 --> 01:34:23.30
And you don't have the choice again.

1687
01:34:23.30 --> 01:34:24.30
You don't have the choice.

1688
01:34:24.30 --> 01:34:25.30
That gets cleared on.

1689
01:34:25.30 --> 01:34:29.30
That force continues to push west so that we can finish the mission of this operation.

1690
01:34:29.30 --> 01:34:31.30
We got a continuing providing our blocking position.

1691
01:34:31.30 --> 01:34:32.30
And that's it.

1692
01:34:32.30 --> 01:34:36.30
If you lose focus, more of that's going to happen.

1693
01:34:36.30 --> 01:34:41.30
It's a difficult thing to deal with, but that's what we signed up to do.

1694
01:34:41.30 --> 01:34:46.30
That that's why we have an all-volunteer force and it's the greatest military force this world has ever seen.

1695
01:34:46.30 --> 01:34:49.30
And it's unfortunate, but part of it is dying.

1696
01:34:49.30 --> 01:34:50.30
We die in battle.

1697
01:34:50.30 --> 01:34:53.30
So that the innocent people here that live in America don't.

1698
01:34:53.30 --> 01:34:55.30
And it sucks and it's painful.

1699
01:34:55.30 --> 01:34:57.30
But at the end of the day, we all, we know.

1700
01:34:57.30 --> 01:35:00.30
When we sign up, we know that that is a possibility.

1701
01:35:00.30 --> 01:35:03.30
It is indeed.

1702
01:35:03.30 --> 01:35:07.30
Now, you had nine guys wounded from your pull-toon.

1703
01:35:07.30 --> 01:35:09.30
Is that right?

1704
01:35:09.30 --> 01:35:11.30
From that whole deployment?

1705
01:35:11.30 --> 01:35:14.30
From that couple days.

1706
01:35:14.30 --> 01:35:15.30
Okay, yes.

1707
01:35:15.30 --> 01:35:16.30
Here we go.

1708
01:35:16.30 --> 01:35:17.30
Nine men in a week.

1709
01:35:17.30 --> 01:35:18.30
I'll go to the book.

1710
01:35:18.30 --> 01:35:21.30
But some of the more of the reservist tankers that weren't technically mine.

1711
01:35:21.30 --> 01:35:29.30
The loss of so many Marines under my command had eaten away at me.

1712
01:35:29.30 --> 01:35:32.30
Almost to the point where I suffered a crisis in confidence.

1713
01:35:32.30 --> 01:35:34.30
Nine men in a week of combat.

1714
01:35:34.30 --> 01:35:35.30
What had I done wrong?

1715
01:35:35.30 --> 01:35:37.30
What had I done wrong?

1716
01:35:37.30 --> 01:35:39.30
What lessons could I learn?

1717
01:35:39.30 --> 01:35:42.30
My mind obsessed over those questions.

1718
01:35:42.30 --> 01:35:47.30
Inside the COC, I braised for the shitstorm.

1719
01:35:47.30 --> 01:35:52.30
Captain Ford Phillips, my company commander spotted me as I came through the door.

1720
01:35:52.30 --> 01:35:53.30
He swiftly took me aside.

1721
01:35:53.30 --> 01:35:54.30
Here it comes.

1722
01:35:54.30 --> 01:35:57.30
I thought, Brian, excellent job.

1723
01:35:57.30 --> 01:36:00.30
You did everything right out there.

1724
01:36:00.30 --> 01:36:01.30
Thank you.

1725
01:36:01.30 --> 01:36:04.30
My job almost fell open.

1726
01:36:04.30 --> 01:36:07.30
Those were the last words I had expected to hear.

1727
01:36:07.30 --> 01:36:13.30
I greatly admired Captain Phillips and, in long since learned, he always meant what he said.

1728
01:36:13.30 --> 01:36:16.30
His words were never designed to make someone feel better.

1729
01:36:16.30 --> 01:36:23.30
They were always designed to make a man, a better officer, and a better Marine, always.

1730
01:36:23.30 --> 01:36:26.30
His words ease the pain of the last seven days.

1731
01:36:26.30 --> 01:36:31.30
But to not erase the guilt that I felt, to this day I questioned the decisions I made that night.

1732
01:36:31.30 --> 01:36:33.30
That is the onus of command.

1733
01:36:33.30 --> 01:36:36.30
You always bear the responsibility for those under you.

1734
01:36:36.30 --> 01:36:41.30
When they suffer wounds or are killed by the enemy, it is impossible for an officer not to second guess himself,

1735
01:36:41.30 --> 01:36:45.30
and own part of their suffering or deaths.

1736
01:36:45.30 --> 01:36:48.30
As leaders, we understand control.

1737
01:36:48.30 --> 01:36:50.30
That is where we operate.

1738
01:36:50.30 --> 01:36:52.30
Having it is comfort.

1739
01:36:52.30 --> 01:36:57.30
But combat and the enemy strips that away at times.

1740
01:36:57.30 --> 01:37:03.30
Once the bullets fly and the violent chaos of a firefight, rains, control becomes an illusion.

1741
01:37:03.30 --> 01:37:08.30
A platoon commander cannot determine which enemy bullets will strike what vehicles.

1742
01:37:08.30 --> 01:37:11.30
He cannot select the moment when an insurgent triggers an ID.

1743
01:37:11.30 --> 01:37:16.30
He cannot dictate who survives and who doesn't.

1744
01:37:16.30 --> 01:37:22.14
All he can do is try and fight back to try and demolish the chaos with enough firepower that the enemy

1745
01:37:22.14 --> 01:37:24.14
dies or runs away.

1746
01:37:24.14 --> 01:37:29.14
Almost everything else is beyond the leader's control.

1747
01:37:29.14 --> 01:37:32.14
Those limits of leadership were never drilled into us at the academy.

1748
01:37:32.14 --> 01:37:40.14
When I experienced it for the first time during Operation Madador, I came gradually to understand on an intellectual level.

1749
01:37:40.14 --> 01:37:49.14
But in my heart, I still wonder if I could have done something else that might have saved my Marines from harm.

1750
01:37:49.14 --> 01:37:59.14
I still spend sleepless nights replaying every moment in my head, hoping men like Robert Gas and Jonathan Low can forgive me.

1751
01:37:59.14 --> 01:38:04.14
All part of it, man.

1752
01:38:04.14 --> 01:38:07.14
It's funny you read that passage.

1753
01:38:07.14 --> 01:38:09.14
I was up last night, same thing.

1754
01:38:09.14 --> 01:38:13.14
245 in the morning and replaying it.

1755
01:38:13.14 --> 01:38:19.14
It's not something I would say, there's a negative aspect.

1756
01:38:19.14 --> 01:38:22.14
People will hear me say that, man, that's bad.

1757
01:38:22.14 --> 01:38:24.14
Post traumatic stress or something.

1758
01:38:24.14 --> 01:38:25.14
No.

1759
01:38:25.14 --> 01:38:28.14
It's me being a human being who cares and wonders.

1760
01:38:28.14 --> 01:38:29.14
And it's hard.

1761
01:38:29.14 --> 01:38:31.14
That's never going to go away.

1762
01:38:31.14 --> 01:38:33.14
And I'll always wonder that.

1763
01:38:33.14 --> 01:38:39.14
Wouldn't it have been a better decision to take a left turn and abort the mission at that point?

1764
01:38:39.14 --> 01:38:41.14
Should I have tried to get back to the bridge?

1765
01:38:41.14 --> 01:38:50.14
Or if I had gone three blocks up maybe there would have been a path we could have found and put her headlights on, there are so many.

1766
01:38:50.14 --> 01:38:54.14
What if so many what if that you go through as leaders?

1767
01:38:54.14 --> 01:39:03.14
And if you try to ignore those times where you spend those sleepless nights and not think through it, I think it makes it worse.

1768
01:39:03.14 --> 01:39:08.14
I think the fact that I'll go through the drill like last night, which is the first time and a long time that I did.

1769
01:39:08.14 --> 01:39:12.14
I think part of it is I knew we'd probably be talking about it.

1770
01:39:12.14 --> 01:39:16.14
I think it's healthy to do that for me at least it has been.

1771
01:39:16.14 --> 01:39:19.14
It's healthy for me to replay that and to understand.

1772
01:39:19.14 --> 01:39:23.14
And you talked about that moment with my company Commander Ford Phillips.

1773
01:39:23.14 --> 01:39:25.14
I remember that conversation.

1774
01:39:25.14 --> 01:39:32.14
And I remember going back at him a little bit and saying, I just thought, I think if I would have done this or done that and he stopped me.

1775
01:39:32.14 --> 01:39:36.14
Brian, listen, you did everything right.

1776
01:39:36.14 --> 01:39:43.14
You did everything that you could do out there and it was, you know, it was definitely what I needed to hear because we still had a long way to go in that deployment.

1777
01:39:43.14 --> 01:39:45.14
And I still had to go do another one.

1778
01:39:45.14 --> 01:39:52.14
It was it was great leadership on his part because it gave me there was no more second guessing at that point.

1779
01:39:52.14 --> 01:40:02.14
You know, because that was not the time to sit there and start to question my decision to my instincts and battle that it served me well up until that point.

1780
01:40:02.14 --> 01:40:06.14
I had a similar conversation as a matter of fact with life.

1781
01:40:06.14 --> 01:40:17.14
So, you know, when Mark Lee got killed, it was Ryan Job who ended up dying as well, but he had been severely wounded.

1782
01:40:17.14 --> 01:40:22.14
And life was down at a combat outpost with his platoon.

1783
01:40:22.14 --> 01:40:29.14
And we got Ryan Job had been casted back out and now the guys are down at this combat outpost.

1784
01:40:29.14 --> 01:40:40.14
And the army who the 137 bulldogs, Bravo Company, who we had amazing relationship with Captain Mike Bama, Maine Gun Mike.

1785
01:40:40.14 --> 01:40:48.14
They were out trying to get after it and they got to a point where they said, hey, we think we know where these guys are.

1786
01:40:48.14 --> 01:40:50.14
That shot Ryan.

1787
01:40:50.14 --> 01:41:01.14
You can you guys help us. I mean, it was like the worst day of fighting and life called me up on the radio and says, hey, I want to go back out.

1788
01:41:01.14 --> 01:41:04.14
They think they know where these guys are.

1789
01:41:04.14 --> 01:41:08.14
I want to go back out and I was like, go, go get some.

1790
01:41:08.14 --> 01:41:13.14
And even out and you know, they were under heavy fire and that's when Mark got killed.

1791
01:41:13.14 --> 01:41:22.14
And you know, life was, you know, he was, you know, the mission gets done and all that, but next day, life comes to me.

1792
01:41:22.14 --> 01:41:29.14
And he says, you know, hey, hey, Jockel, he was tore up, you know, he was tore up his friends.

1793
01:41:29.14 --> 01:41:39.14
His brother was, was dead, his other friend was severely wounded, but what really got to him was Mark because, you know, he made this decision to go back out.

1794
01:41:39.14 --> 01:41:45.14
And he said to me, you know, I just don't know if I, you want to know if I made the right decision.

1795
01:41:45.14 --> 01:41:53.14
And I said to you, I said to him, life, there was no decision to make.

1796
01:41:53.14 --> 01:42:02.14
There was Americans out there fighting in the streets trying to get after these guys that had wounded one of your guys, one of our guys.

1797
01:42:02.14 --> 01:42:08.14
And they thought they knew where he was and they thought you could go and get them.

1798
01:42:08.14 --> 01:42:11.14
There's no decision to make you don't have to have a choice in that situation.

1799
01:42:11.14 --> 01:42:17.14
You do what you do as an American, as a seal, as a frog man.

1800
01:42:17.14 --> 01:42:19.14
There was no decision.

1801
01:42:19.14 --> 01:42:38.14
You did what we do.

1802
01:42:38.14 --> 01:42:41.14
And I think that's something that any leader.

1803
01:42:41.14 --> 01:42:47.14
When you get your young leaders out there, you know, obviously, if they screw something up,

1804
01:42:47.14 --> 01:42:49.14
obviously, that's a different story.

1805
01:42:49.14 --> 01:42:53.14
But, you know, we don't have the luxury of knowing what's going to happen to combat situation.

1806
01:42:53.14 --> 01:42:55.14
There's no crystal ball.

1807
01:42:55.14 --> 01:42:57.14
There's no, you don't know.

1808
01:42:57.14 --> 01:43:01.14
Like what you just said, guys would say that stuff to me sometimes like, you could have gone left to right.

1809
01:43:01.14 --> 01:43:02.14
Oh really?

1810
01:43:02.14 --> 01:43:06.14
Because if you could have gone left, like you just talked about and hit a giant ID and now everyone's dead.

1811
01:43:06.14 --> 01:43:09.14
You could have gone straight and you could have gotten clear.

1812
01:43:09.14 --> 01:43:10.14
You don't know.

1813
01:43:10.14 --> 01:43:12.14
You don't have that luxury in combat.

1814
01:43:12.14 --> 01:43:15.14
You're making decisions based on the information that you have at that time.

1815
01:43:15.14 --> 01:43:18.14
You don't know all this other shit yet.

1816
01:43:18.14 --> 01:43:24.14
If you knew it, obviously, looking back on size 2020, we wouldn't have even gone there in the first place.

1817
01:43:24.14 --> 01:43:25.14
But we don't know that.

1818
01:43:25.14 --> 01:43:28.14
The only way to avoid any risk is not to go.

1819
01:43:28.14 --> 01:43:29.14
It's not to do your job.

1820
01:43:29.14 --> 01:43:34.14
It's to just go ahead and stand up, raise your hand and say, I'm a coward.

1821
01:43:34.14 --> 01:43:37.14
That's how you can avoid these situations.

1822
01:43:37.14 --> 01:43:42.14
But, guys in the Marine Corps, guys in the Seal teams, they don't raise your hand and say that.

1823
01:43:42.14 --> 01:43:44.14
They raise their hand and say, where's the bad guys in the Marine Corps?

1824
01:43:44.14 --> 01:43:45.14
Where's the bad guys?

1825
01:43:45.14 --> 01:43:48.14
We're going to get them.

1826
01:43:48.14 --> 01:43:53.14
And one of the mistakes you can make too is sometimes you want to stop and you want to think about it.

1827
01:43:53.14 --> 01:43:56.14
Sometimes there is no right answer.

1828
01:43:56.14 --> 01:43:58.14
There's a bunch of things you can do.

1829
01:43:58.14 --> 01:44:05.14
There's a bunch of options and whatever one you take in maintain tempo and achieve tempo and stay a step ahead of the enemy is the right one.

1830
01:44:05.14 --> 01:44:07.14
It's how you execute it.

1831
01:44:07.14 --> 01:44:13.14
Either way, you could be going into a bad day, but you better do it your way and on your terms.

1832
01:44:13.14 --> 01:44:17.14
Yeah, one thing that's guaranteed to turn into a bad day is sitting there and not doing nothing.

1833
01:44:17.14 --> 01:44:18.14
Absolutely.

1834
01:44:18.14 --> 01:44:20.14
Because I'll tell you what, if you're not maneuvering, the enemy is maneuvering.

1835
01:44:20.14 --> 01:44:23.14
If you're not maneuvering, the enemy is absolutely maneuvering.

1836
01:44:23.14 --> 01:44:25.14
They're getting you, they're getting a high ground.

1837
01:44:25.14 --> 01:44:26.14
They're doing something.

1838
01:44:26.14 --> 01:44:30.14
So you better just be in action, taking action, make a decision and go.

1839
01:44:30.14 --> 01:44:31.14
Especially in their turf.

1840
01:44:31.14 --> 01:44:32.14
Their turf.

1841
01:44:32.14 --> 01:44:36.14
Their cities, their neighborhoods, they know every corner.

1842
01:44:36.14 --> 01:44:41.14
We're guessing.

1843
01:44:41.14 --> 01:44:43.14
So now you come back.

1844
01:44:43.14 --> 01:44:49.14
You, I'm fast forwarding to where you're now becoming a company.

1845
01:44:49.14 --> 01:44:50.14
Exo.

1846
01:44:50.14 --> 01:44:52.14
I'm going to the book just after we deployed again in 2006.

1847
01:44:52.14 --> 01:44:56.14
I was pulled from weapons company to become executive officer for India company three two Marines.

1848
01:44:56.14 --> 01:44:57.14
It happened so fast.

1849
01:44:57.14 --> 01:44:59.14
I'd have time to get no my new Marines.

1850
01:44:59.14 --> 01:45:06.14
Before we ended up in country again, we deployed to Alombar province to a fob near Habanía.

1851
01:45:06.14 --> 01:45:08.14
And this was cool because you were in Habanía.

1852
01:45:08.14 --> 01:45:13.14
And I was 20 miles away in Ramadi in that summer of 2006.

1853
01:45:13.14 --> 01:45:17.14
Next, my company lost former Marines killed.

1854
01:45:17.14 --> 01:45:24.14
Lance Corporal Don Champ, champ, was our first he was killed by a roadside bomb on the main road running through our area.

1855
01:45:24.14 --> 01:45:26.14
That was the end of August of 2006.

1856
01:45:26.14 --> 01:45:33.14
A month later on the 24th of our company commander sent a platoon out after an insurgent who'd fired a rocket into one of our patrol bases.

1857
01:45:33.14 --> 01:45:37.14
They'd gone out without a special device that blocked incoming cell phone signals and prevented insurgents.

1858
01:45:37.14 --> 01:45:40.14
From remotely detonating IEDs.

1859
01:45:40.14 --> 01:45:44.14
Sure enough, the platoon got hit with a bomb.

1860
01:45:44.14 --> 01:45:49.14
Blue Lance Corporal Renee Martinez 70 meters into the air.

1861
01:45:49.14 --> 01:45:51.14
He died instantly.

1862
01:45:51.14 --> 01:45:53.14
That one really hurt.

1863
01:45:53.14 --> 01:45:55.14
I'd been on the base at the time.

1864
01:45:55.14 --> 01:46:06.14
I took great pride in going out on patrols, not to ride herd on the platoon commanders, but to be there as an additional asset and to share the risks with my Marines.

1865
01:46:06.14 --> 01:46:10.14
This time I'd been tied up and couldn't get out there with the men.

1866
01:46:10.14 --> 01:46:13.14
When I heard it was happening, I grabbed a humvee and race to the scene.

1867
01:46:13.14 --> 01:46:16.14
We carried Renee back to the morgue.

1868
01:46:16.14 --> 01:46:22.14
Inside us to the next to him held his hand and said my goodbyes.

1869
01:46:22.14 --> 01:46:27.14
I will carry the guilt of that day for the rest of my life.

1870
01:46:27.14 --> 01:46:31.14
I should have been out there with that platoon.

1871
01:46:31.14 --> 01:46:40.14
We kept taking casualties that fall.

1872
01:46:40.14 --> 01:46:43.14
Even units just passing through our area got hit.

1873
01:46:43.14 --> 01:46:46.14
One EOD rig got hit with a roadside bomb.

1874
01:46:46.14 --> 01:46:50.14
Though the blast didn't destroy the armored humvee, it set off a couple.

1875
01:46:50.14 --> 01:46:57.14
Foss for us based in Cendor area, Renee's the EOD team had left on the floor of their rig.

1876
01:46:57.14 --> 01:47:04.14
Before we could even get to them, the white hot chemical fired melted them where they sat.

1877
01:47:04.14 --> 01:47:07.14
The site was indescribable.

1878
01:47:07.14 --> 01:47:11.14
After that scene, morale in the company plummeted.

1879
01:47:11.14 --> 01:47:15.14
The men questioned the mission, what was the point?

1880
01:47:15.14 --> 01:47:22.14
We were getting shot at almost every day, going into Havana, the patrol was a daily nightmare of snipers, bombs and ambushes.

1881
01:47:22.14 --> 01:47:29.14
Half the time we couldn't even fire back the rules of engagement were so strict that if civilians were in the area, we could not engage the enemy.

1882
01:47:29.14 --> 01:47:38.14
Since there were almost always civilians in the area, our Marines had to show incredible restraint even as they watched their brothers die.

1883
01:47:38.14 --> 01:47:42.14
So you guys were wrapped that R.E.R.E. was tight.

1884
01:47:42.14 --> 01:47:43.14
It was tough.

1885
01:47:43.14 --> 01:47:47.14
I mean, it was Havana had never been patroled before.

1886
01:47:47.14 --> 01:47:54.14
They had set up patrol bases, but they had never gone out and walked around and they had, you know, the outgoing units said, you don't want to do that.

1887
01:47:54.14 --> 01:47:56.14
You don't want to do that.

1888
01:47:56.14 --> 01:47:57.14
But you had to.

1889
01:47:57.14 --> 01:48:03.14
They only waited to defeat that enemy with the suffocate, the area, and what mattered most of the people.

1890
01:48:03.14 --> 01:48:07.14
If the people trusted us, they would feed us the information to get captured the enemy.

1891
01:48:07.14 --> 01:48:12.14
If the people trusted them, because we wouldn't patrol and we were scared, then they would trust them.

1892
01:48:12.14 --> 01:48:16.14
We wouldn't have to be accomplishing our mission.

1893
01:48:16.14 --> 01:48:19.14
And it was so hard.

1894
01:48:19.14 --> 01:48:25.14
You know, people have this idea that because you were a certain rank everybody's going to listen.

1895
01:48:25.14 --> 01:48:30.14
Or it's a hard core leadership and they're not going to ask questions.

1896
01:48:30.14 --> 01:48:35.14
When I would go patrol based to patrol based and speak to my men and they would ask, why?

1897
01:48:35.14 --> 01:48:38.14
Why should I walk out there tomorrow?

1898
01:48:38.14 --> 01:48:45.14
You know, we don't have CNN and this general or the president talking to us, given us this big, huge hate.

1899
01:48:45.14 --> 01:48:47.14
Here's the ultimate game plan over.

1900
01:48:47.14 --> 01:48:49.14
We don't get any of that.

1901
01:48:49.14 --> 01:48:53.14
My guys were showering once every 17, 18 days.

1902
01:48:53.14 --> 01:48:54.14
That's it.

1903
01:48:54.14 --> 01:49:02.14
We were living amongst the populists, amongst the enemy that was traveling all around the country coming in and attacking us.

1904
01:49:02.14 --> 01:49:07.14
And so it got really difficult, but the one thing that stuck with them, that they could understand that

1905
01:49:07.14 --> 01:49:17.14
they're perspective they got was, hey, look, if you quit on me, that's one less guy to man the post and top of this patrol base to keep this roadway clear.

1906
01:49:17.14 --> 01:49:23.14
That's one less guy, guard a Mikey's flank when you go on patrol and you got three patrols tomorrow.

1907
01:49:23.14 --> 01:49:36.14
We were already so thin at that time, our battle space was way too big for us to truly suffocate it to make sure the enemy couldn't come in in influence.

1908
01:49:36.14 --> 01:49:38.14
Way too big.

1909
01:49:38.14 --> 01:49:48.14
But as we got better, as we secured the area and we focused really on the main supply route and the economic parts of that, the shops.

1910
01:49:48.14 --> 01:49:57.14
If we get you to cure the shops and secure the schools, because the kids couldn't go to school and the kids tried to go to school, I'll kind of kill the teachers.

1911
01:49:57.14 --> 01:50:04.14
So now we secure the area enough that the two schools could open when we were able to do that, then the shops opened up.

1912
01:50:04.14 --> 01:50:10.14
And the people could start living their lives again. That was one of the proudest days of my marine lives when those kids could walk to school again.

1913
01:50:10.14 --> 01:50:16.14
These schools were corners blown up from IEDs, bullet holes, and there were no roofs.

1914
01:50:16.14 --> 01:50:20.14
I mean, they were by our standards in America, you wouldn't be able to fathom with these look like.

1915
01:50:20.14 --> 01:50:30.14
They were basically concrete squares with really bad desks in them. The school supplies they had were given to them from us.

1916
01:50:30.14 --> 01:50:36.14
And so that was a huge win for us and at that time was right around the same time of the surge.

1917
01:50:36.14 --> 01:50:48.14
When the surge took place, what happened was two Iraqi companies pushed west and we were able to take up a quarter of our battle space, which then greatly allowed us now.

1918
01:50:48.14 --> 01:50:52.14
Now we've got enough people. Now we can really influence it.

1919
01:50:52.14 --> 01:50:57.14
What happened were the Iraqi people who he would sit down and have dinner with them and bring them gifts and talk to them.

1920
01:50:57.14 --> 01:51:01.14
I'd have meetings with them at two in the morning when they felt comfortable to speak to me.

1921
01:51:01.14 --> 01:51:07.14
Now they're telling me who, where, what time, where can we get them?

1922
01:51:07.14 --> 01:51:11.14
And when you've got marine's question, the mission, and all of a sudden you deliver them some intel.

1923
01:51:11.14 --> 01:51:14.14
And say hey at 3am, you're going to go find this person at this spot.

1924
01:51:14.14 --> 01:51:17.14
This is what they look like, this is what they're called, get them.

1925
01:51:17.14 --> 01:51:19.14
And then they get excited.

1926
01:51:19.14 --> 01:51:25.14
And I don't mean get them as in terms of hey, they're going to go and they're going to go kill that person.

1927
01:51:25.14 --> 01:51:28.14
They're going to go capture them and we had a whole process.

1928
01:51:28.14 --> 01:51:33.14
That whole very frustrating, but you had to literally now, now I'm regional on our country.

1929
01:51:33.14 --> 01:51:35.14
And now they're also detectives.

1930
01:51:35.14 --> 01:51:38.14
Alright, so this is the intel package that led to this detention.

1931
01:51:38.14 --> 01:51:40.14
Here's the paperwork for the detention.

1932
01:51:40.14 --> 01:51:42.14
We delivered them to the detention center.

1933
01:51:42.14 --> 01:51:46.14
If you don't hit every wicket right, that person's back on the streets in three days.

1934
01:51:46.14 --> 01:51:51.14
So that was also detailed discipline in doing all the right things, but they did it.

1935
01:51:51.14 --> 01:51:58.14
And I tell you, Ramadi Habaniah, they were some of the worst areas that I racked that fall.

1936
01:51:58.14 --> 01:52:01.14
By Christmas time, he was amazing the turn of it.

1937
01:52:01.14 --> 01:52:03.14
They were quiet.

1938
01:52:03.14 --> 01:52:04.14
They were quiet.

1939
01:52:04.14 --> 01:52:10.14
It was, it was, you know, I left October 21st, 2006.

1940
01:52:10.14 --> 01:52:14.14
There was 30 to 50 enemy attacks a day while I was in deployment that six months.

1941
01:52:14.14 --> 01:52:19.14
By January, there was like one or two enemy attacks a day.

1942
01:52:19.14 --> 01:52:22.14
Down from 30 to 50, it was boom.

1943
01:52:22.14 --> 01:52:23.14
It was incredible.

1944
01:52:23.14 --> 01:52:24.14
Incredible.

1945
01:52:24.14 --> 01:52:25.14
Incredible.

1946
01:52:25.14 --> 01:52:29.14
We left in February, February 2007.

1947
01:52:29.14 --> 01:52:37.14
And speaking to common home, third battalion, second Marines came home in 2007 after suffering

1948
01:52:37.14 --> 01:52:38.14
15 killed in action.

1949
01:52:38.14 --> 01:52:44.14
It could have been far worse for all of us if we hadn't seen any progress in harmony.

1950
01:52:44.14 --> 01:52:45.14
That's what you're talking about.

1951
01:52:45.14 --> 01:52:49.14
Then all those questions we had over the mission and its value would have returned home to term

1952
01:52:49.14 --> 01:52:51.14
A torment us for years to come.

1953
01:52:51.14 --> 01:53:00.14
In fact, we did see progress and that made it a little easier to accept things.

1954
01:53:00.14 --> 01:53:05.14
And yeah, that's basically what you just said.

1955
01:53:05.14 --> 01:53:12.14
And that's why you and I were talking about this on the way over as nice as it was that we got to see that happen.

1956
01:53:12.14 --> 01:53:21.14
It was nothing more sickening to me than to have eight years later have the black flag of ISIS flying over the city of

1957
01:53:21.14 --> 01:53:26.14
Romadi at the government center that it was just absolutely heinous to see that.

1958
01:53:26.14 --> 01:53:28.14
It didn't need to happen.

1959
01:53:28.14 --> 01:53:35.14
And you know, they actually took Romadi back again through massive air strike.

1960
01:53:35.14 --> 01:53:39.14
And I was talking to one of my buddies that that was a J-TAC that's actually coming on the podcast.

1961
01:53:39.14 --> 01:53:47.14
I was talking to you about earlier, but he's I was like, how many bombs did we drop in Romadi while we were there?

1962
01:53:47.14 --> 01:53:49.14
Because it was a populist city.

1963
01:53:49.14 --> 01:53:52.14
There was normal Iraqis that won the live their lives.

1964
01:53:52.14 --> 01:53:53.14
We were dropping bombs.

1965
01:53:53.14 --> 01:53:56.14
He was like, I don't know, maybe it doesn't 15.

1966
01:53:56.14 --> 01:54:02.14
In the second portion of the money that the Iraqis just did behind the strength of American firepower.

1967
01:54:02.14 --> 01:54:04.14
You know how many air missions they did?

1968
01:54:04.14 --> 01:54:07.14
They did 600 strike missions.

1969
01:54:07.14 --> 01:54:10.14
And you see pictures of Romadi right now?

1970
01:54:10.14 --> 01:54:11.14
It's rubble.

1971
01:54:11.14 --> 01:54:15.14
Now they're rebuilding it now, but it was just just rubble.

1972
01:54:15.14 --> 01:54:20.14
And yeah, it's just, it's so disheartening.

1973
01:54:20.14 --> 01:54:31.14
So you come home from that deployment and it's pretty quickly after you got home that Travis got killed.

1974
01:54:31.14 --> 01:54:41.14
And you know, I wanted to give a little credit here to the mid teams because Travis was a mid team which is military transition team, which was okay.

1975
01:54:41.14 --> 01:54:43.14
So I talk about this sometimes, right?

1976
01:54:43.14 --> 01:54:49.14
So the seals and the special operations guys a lot of times we live in relative comfort.

1977
01:54:49.14 --> 01:54:52.14
Okay, so we live like, okay, we're pretty comfortable.

1978
01:54:52.14 --> 01:54:54.14
You know, like I said, I had mats on deployment.

1979
01:54:54.14 --> 01:54:59.14
I brought a GP medium tent to put mats in because I got to train some J-Jets.

1980
01:54:59.14 --> 01:55:05.14
We have a nice weight room, you know, we and seals are super aggressive and crafty and figure out like, okay, what can we do?

1981
01:55:05.14 --> 01:55:06.14
How can we get this?

1982
01:55:06.14 --> 01:55:08.14
Well, contractors and order and stuff.

1983
01:55:08.14 --> 01:55:12.14
And so we just make we do a good job of building our infrastructure.

1984
01:55:12.14 --> 01:55:16.14
And when I say infrastructure, I mean some comforts come with that, right?

1985
01:55:16.14 --> 01:55:20.14
Now you go to the conventional, check a step down because they're not getting as much leeway.

1986
01:55:20.14 --> 01:55:23.14
They don't have as much, they can't get away with as much.

1987
01:55:23.14 --> 01:55:28.14
So they're living maybe a little bit harder, maybe even a lot harder than, and of course, a little bit more.

1988
01:55:28.14 --> 01:55:36.14
And of course, a, by the way, there's special operations guys that are living out in the sticks and Afghanistan with two of them with, you know, 280 tribesmen.

1989
01:55:36.14 --> 01:55:43.14
So I'm saying, I'm talking about my particular situation, which my particular situation was, in Iraq when I deployed there, we always lived good.

1990
01:55:43.14 --> 01:55:45.14
Always lived good.

1991
01:55:45.14 --> 01:55:51.14
Conventionals, we'd go out to their outstations, we'd stop on a way to a mission, we'd stop by someone, you know, stop by wherever,

1992
01:55:51.14 --> 01:55:59.14
wherever, some cops somewhere or some fobs somewhere, those guys are living rough. And I had seals, my seals that lived in correct order, they were living rough.

1993
01:55:59.14 --> 01:56:05.14
But my point is, you go one step further, and now you get to what's called a mid team.

1994
01:56:05.14 --> 01:56:10.14
And the mid teams are embedded with Iraqi troops.

1995
01:56:10.14 --> 01:56:18.14
And so they are living with Iraqi troops, there might be two, three, maybe four of them, and they're out there, living with their Iraqi troops.

1996
01:56:18.14 --> 01:56:22.14
Counting on the security of the Iraqi forces to protect them.

1997
01:56:22.14 --> 01:56:34.14
And I mean, it was horrible. When we first got to a body, there was a, there was a VBI-D attack that killed the oncoming mid team commander and the outgoing mid team commander.

1998
01:56:34.14 --> 01:56:46.14
They're doing a turnover at a station and VBI-D came killed them both wounded a bunch, but it's interesting because I didn't know Travis was a supply officer in the free corps.

1999
01:56:46.14 --> 01:56:55.14
And so the Marine Corps has this way of selecting where you, where you get what you get to be in the Marine Corps as an officer, they take the class and chunk it up in a thirds.

2000
01:56:55.14 --> 01:57:00.14
And then the, the each top third, you get a pick and it goes down the list.

2001
01:57:00.14 --> 01:57:06.14
So that way they don't have every single guy at all the best guy is quote unquote going to be Marine Corps.

2002
01:57:06.14 --> 01:57:12.14
And if you're going to be a pilot, you, you might be the bottom, the top of the bottom third in the class and you get your pick.

2003
01:57:12.14 --> 01:57:26.14
So you don't, it doesn't matter how you perform. I mean it matters, but out of a class of over 200, Travis was 17 in his class at the Basics School, which is a very prestigious, to graduate, the top 25 is incredible.

2004
01:57:26.14 --> 01:57:31.14
And he got his third choice. His third is a logistics officer. He was furious.

2005
01:57:31.14 --> 01:57:37.14
So he's angry. And then, and the Marine Corps did this very, very well.

2006
01:57:37.14 --> 01:57:42.14
They understood the importance of the mid team, so they really took great guys and send them to the mid teams.

2007
01:57:42.14 --> 01:57:58.14
And he, so they, they put up volunteers. Hey, who wants, who wants to raise your hand and go live amongst the Iraqis, counting on them for security training them, working with them, eating their crappy food, living without air conditioning.

2008
01:57:58.14 --> 01:58:00.14
It just sucks. It's just sucks. It's awful.

2009
01:58:00.14 --> 01:58:04.14
Of course, what does Travis do? Well, I'm game. Oh, yeah. Let's do this.

2010
01:58:04.14 --> 01:58:15.14
So he went, and obviously, he was, he was, he was killed in action. He was killed in action during a firefight trying to, like, you just talked about.

2011
01:58:15.14 --> 01:58:21.14
Wasn't trying to save other Marines. He was trying to save his fellow Iraqi soldiers.

2012
01:58:21.14 --> 01:58:32.14
And just like you just said, there's so many people that don't understand how closely we worked with Iraqi soldiers and how committed we were with helping them.

2013
01:58:32.14 --> 01:58:35.14
So that's a classic example.

2014
01:58:35.14 --> 01:58:45.14
And by the way, that that, that ulogy that he wrote for himself was this.

2015
01:58:45.14 --> 01:58:53.14
Travis, man, was a man on a freed to stand for what was right.

2016
01:58:53.14 --> 01:59:04.14
I think that's something that anybody could aspire towards.

2017
01:59:04.14 --> 01:59:20.14
And actually another, you know, you talked about the connections earlier. Well, there's a connection here that Travis's roommate in the Naval Academy was a guy by the name of Brendan Looney who,

2018
01:59:20.14 --> 01:59:29.14
did what you talked about the painful way of getting to the seal-tams he went to the surface warfare community. Then he got picked up for the seal teams went through seal training.

2019
01:59:29.14 --> 01:59:37.14
And he was also killed in Afghanistan in 21 September 2010.

2020
01:59:37.14 --> 01:59:43.14
But you come home from that deployment. And now you've got your married.

2021
01:59:43.14 --> 01:59:49.14
You got one daughter, you're expecting another daughter. And by the way, this whole time like we talked about earlier, you've been fighting MMA.

2022
01:59:49.14 --> 01:59:55.14
You fought your first profile was between deployments.

2023
01:59:55.14 --> 02:00:04.14
Yeah. And your amateur fights we were going to talk about was before your first deployment. And you make a decision that you're going to get out of the Marine Corps.

2024
02:00:04.14 --> 02:00:10.14
And obviously this is probably the hardest decision you ever had to make of you at that point.

2025
02:00:10.14 --> 02:00:22.14
But it's 2007. How much are you thinking at that time like, I'm going to go for this MMA thing? It's going to be, I got a shot at the making it.

2026
02:00:22.14 --> 02:00:25.14
You know, it was, it was, I knew I had a shot at it.

2027
02:00:25.14 --> 02:00:31.14
You must have thought you had a shot because your ass was undefeated at this point. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, of course.

2028
02:00:31.14 --> 02:00:38.14
It was the man. The worst thing that could have happened, right? I mean, the worst thing. I'm training with, so I would basically go around the base.

2029
02:00:38.14 --> 02:00:43.14
And I found this corpsman with cauliflower here. Hey, how'd you get that cauliflower?

2030
02:00:43.14 --> 02:00:51.14
Stay champ at Oklahoma Wrestling in high school. Oh, be here. 1800 every night. Got it. All bring you gear. Cool. He was in.

2031
02:00:51.14 --> 02:00:55.14
And he then started training with the started fighting, but that got a wrestler dude.

2032
02:00:55.14 --> 02:01:01.14
No, right? Another key to wrestle. Hey, you do your blue belt and your jitsu, your my instructor master.

2033
02:01:01.14 --> 02:01:11.14
He was my master. I had no striking coach. He had no padwork, no nothing. It was me and a couple of Marines plus a corpsman.

2034
02:01:11.14 --> 02:01:19.14
And we would get after every day. And then every time we fought, we won. So we thought we really knew what we were doing.

2035
02:01:19.14 --> 02:01:28.14
And I would take leave every once in a while. I'd take leave and I would go to extreme contour for a couple of days and get destroyed. I went out to Temeculate, Dan Henderson's place.

2036
02:01:28.14 --> 02:01:36.14
I'd go get destroyed. And I'd just try and learn two moves, right? Give me two moves. So here I'm in the WEC again.

2037
02:01:36.14 --> 02:01:44.14
Arm bar from the mouth, arm bar from the guard got those. I know what half guard is now. Can't sweep a soul from it though.

2038
02:01:44.14 --> 02:01:52.14
But Mola Wall showed me how to defend a single leg in a double leg when I was out of Temeculate. So now I got that down path.

2039
02:01:52.14 --> 02:02:08.14
And I still got a mean jab cross. Oh, wait, we go, baby. And I'm winning fights with these things. And you know, I would end up losing the first time at WEC. And that would prompt me to leave Georgia, go find some of the train.

2040
02:02:08.14 --> 02:02:18.14
And I'll never forget my first training session at Jackson, Winkle, John Academy. And I'm there training and Greg Jackson comes walking up to me for my first practice.

2041
02:02:18.14 --> 02:02:26.14
And this is as polite as he could try to compliment me the time. Brian, I am so amazed at how far you've gone with how little information.

2042
02:02:26.14 --> 02:02:28.14
Think again.

2043
02:02:28.14 --> 02:02:29.14
Come on, where?

2044
02:02:29.14 --> 02:02:34.14
Wow, you suck. How the hell did you win all these fights?

2045
02:02:34.14 --> 02:02:43.14
You're so... One of the things I explained, I said, look, when you only know so much, you can fight 150 miles an hour.

2046
02:02:43.14 --> 02:02:52.14
Because you're not thinking. Then all of a sudden I'm learning all these new techniques. Then I started thinking. I had an up and down period there where when some lose some.

2047
02:02:52.14 --> 02:03:00.14
And I got to a point where after the Phil Davis fight, hey, you may be out of here. You know, the UFC wasn't a huge fan of me. They didn't really care.

2048
02:03:00.14 --> 02:03:06.14
They didn't, you know, Joe Sylvester and a huge fan of these WEC guys that were forced upon on that wasn't that talent. He went and found it.

2049
02:03:06.14 --> 02:03:18.14
And I told my I'd fought three times inside of six months and I said, look, I need a break. And I literally looked at my MMA training like you would look at the training of a Marine company.

2050
02:03:18.14 --> 02:03:27.14
Where am I weak? How much time do I have? What am I going to schedule? What am I going to do? Who are the experts I can go to to get better in all these areas?

2051
02:03:27.14 --> 02:03:36.14
And I approached the I knew at that point, hey, look, I still have a full time job. I never fought without one transition on the Marine Corps started working at a company called Met assets.

2052
02:03:36.14 --> 02:03:51.14
Met assets had this this project, this thing. A higher heroes want to help Vets get jobs who maybe you could lead that took that over. So I'm working every day, but at the same time, you know, I started this thing in MMA. I can't go out like this.

2053
02:03:51.14 --> 02:04:01.14
Too many people said I was going to wash out that I was going to be exposed couldn't do it. No way. There were too many Marines at the time taking pride in my performances in there.

2054
02:04:01.14 --> 02:04:13.14
And all the while I was older, yeah, I'm 20 probably 29 at that time. So in terms of MMA age, I'm already, yeah, I'm green and I'm already kind of getting a little old, but I started to find a way started to figure it out.

2055
02:04:13.14 --> 02:04:24.14
And in not cutting any corners like other fighters were at the time, but starting to figure it out and it all just came down to discipline where a lot of martial artists don't want to spend time.

2056
02:04:24.14 --> 02:04:28.14
They don't want to spend 30 minutes drilling one move.

2057
02:04:28.14 --> 02:04:37.14
And understanding how they could use that move from various positions and why it works and how it plays into my style of fighting, why it will be effective.

2058
02:04:37.14 --> 02:04:44.14
They want to drill that one move. They want to do it five times and then they want to go live. Let's go live. Let's go live.

2059
02:04:44.14 --> 02:04:56.14
You know, yeah, and I had learned at that point, if I'm going to catch up with these fighters who are younger, in many cases, but much more experience in me, I have got.

2060
02:04:56.14 --> 02:05:08.14
I've got to take an analytical approach in an honest approach to my skill set and start to show up some holes. I'm in a continued to leave this practice just wrestling like crazy and then submission avoidance.

2061
02:05:08.14 --> 02:05:15.14
It was, it was, I actually went and put a gion for the first time ever. It was, it's working some basics because everyone to hold me down.

2062
02:05:15.14 --> 02:05:19.14
If I could get out from underneath somebody with a gion, it's going to heck of a lot easier, no geek truth.

2063
02:05:19.14 --> 02:05:28.14
I was bringing in wrestlers that were way above my level, a guy named Harry Lester who was, you know, Olympian was coming in and throwing me all over the place.

2064
02:05:28.14 --> 02:05:42.14
And so I was training wrestling nonstop. And then I would go and I'd go to Albuquerque and I'd never fight coming up, but I would go live in Albuquerque for two weeks at a time away from my family and help other guys and their training camps and get exposed and drill.

2065
02:05:42.14 --> 02:05:58.14
And without, here's the other big part was guys like Rashad Evans, Keats Jardine, Joey Vias in your Nate Mark court without those guys. It would have never happened because after they would beat me. After they would pass my guard, take me down. Hit me with this combination.

2066
02:05:58.14 --> 02:06:01.14
They would stop afterwards and tell me how and why.

2067
02:06:01.14 --> 02:06:23.14
And so I learned at a much faster rate than your typical fighter would because not only am I, I'm drilling with some of the best in the world, taking the time to drill and taking analytical approach. Hey, I know we're going to work this today coach, but my butterfly guard is completely ineffective and I'd love to work it specifically, not just on sweeping because I don't think I'm going to get there again against my level of competition to get up.

2068
02:06:23.14 --> 02:06:33.14
I'd love to use it to get up or even just get to the fence where now I've got a third leg that I could utilize to get back up. And so we would drill specifics like that.

2069
02:06:33.14 --> 02:06:48.14
And I've got these guys who have 30 plus fights who are champions now taking the time to help me, which meant a lot to me. I'll never forget it. I mean, they were as much coaches to me as Mike Quinkle John and Greg Jackson were.

2070
02:06:48.14 --> 02:07:03.14
And then, obviously on top, you could do all of that. The other piece that was when I would do my campsit when I really got where I was at my best, when I'd be Chris Lee, Benz, or Santiago, let's see, when I was beating those guys mentally, I was in the best place.

2071
02:07:03.14 --> 02:07:14.14
My family was in a great spot. They were my wife and kids were very supportive of me leaving and doing my camps in Albuquerque, my time away from them. It made me nasty.

2072
02:07:14.14 --> 02:07:22.14
They'd come visit, but man, I would literally look at my opponent like, you're the one who kept me away from my family this long. You're going to pay for it.

2073
02:07:22.14 --> 02:07:35.14
And it was a strong motivator. And if you're in a place to fight or where you're not hungry, getting new information, being able to mentally be in the right place for you to perform.

2074
02:07:35.14 --> 02:07:46.14
It's not about who the better fighter is. It is nothing to do it. It's about who fights best that night. And if you can't mentally be in the state where you're going to fight best that night, you got a problem and you're in the wrong place.

2075
02:07:46.14 --> 02:07:54.14
And that phase of my career, that's when I was there, was able to do that. And that was that was when I was at my best for sure.

2076
02:07:54.14 --> 02:08:06.14
You had some stunning fights. I always tell, you know, sometimes my fighters will say, oh, you know, I'm not feeling it. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. You have, like this is in training. I'll say, look, it doesn't matter how you feel tonight.

2077
02:08:06.14 --> 02:08:14.14
Because fight night come, you might be feeling good, bad doesn't matter. What you have to do is perform right now. That's what you got to do. So train yourself to perform right now.

2078
02:08:14.14 --> 02:08:29.14
But yeah, you had some great fights and Chris leave and I know train with Chris a great guy and that and he's such a tough bastard. And you guys grew down.

2079
02:08:29.14 --> 02:08:33.14
Yeah, we knew we knew neither one of us were going to be that hard to hit.

2080
02:08:33.14 --> 02:08:48.14
But no, tons of respect for that guy. And that was a fight to do enough to take. You know, I saw an opening there where there was a window and he made just take me as a fight to okay, let me go get a win get some money.

2081
02:08:48.14 --> 02:08:58.14
And go on because he had just come off two huge wins and like a week or 10 days. No cycle. And so phenomenal guy in this sport.

2082
02:08:58.14 --> 02:09:08.14
And yeah, you know, it was a wild ride. And when I look back on it, there's definitely some regrets like anybody. There's some things you wish you wish you could have done.

2083
02:09:08.14 --> 02:09:16.14
Some things that happened family wise that certainly stalled and helped aid the decision to stop.

2084
02:09:16.14 --> 02:09:24.14
My wife losing losing her little brother to suicide was a really tough thing. Her mom was living with us at the time. So, you know, us going through that tragedy together. It's hard.

2085
02:09:24.14 --> 02:09:35.14
We were human beings and a lot of fighters of the deal of tragedy and compete. It's what we do for living. We've got to fight through it. It's a hard thing. When I look back on it, where I know I was as an athlete.

2086
02:09:35.14 --> 02:09:50.14
And as a mixed martial arts, how green I was to have come that far and been a legitimate top 10 middleweight at that time. I'm proud of that, especially in the era, especially in the era when I fought where there were some extra clicker activity for going on.

2087
02:09:50.14 --> 02:09:56.14
You're fine against guys that were a lot of guys were on, we're on steroids. There was no testing or that was really limited testing.

2088
02:09:56.14 --> 02:10:01.14
It was an IQ test, right? If you fail that, you're just straight up dumb.

2089
02:10:01.14 --> 02:10:03.14
But it was fun.

2090
02:10:03.14 --> 02:10:13.14
I mean, the guys you lost a jail son, right? Who was two minutes from being the middleweight champion in the world against Anderson Silva?

2091
02:10:13.14 --> 02:10:23.14
You lost to him, you beat Sikara, then you lost to Bizbeng, who actually is the current middleweight champion. So in the guys that beat you were bad asses.

2092
02:10:23.14 --> 02:10:28.14
Yeah, absolutely. And you were a guy that was like started fighting three weeks ago.

2093
02:10:28.14 --> 02:10:31.14
That's just awesome, man. It's a test of it.

2094
02:10:31.14 --> 02:10:42.14
The coolest part about it was during that time, and it kind of happened subtly beneath that, at least to the fight fans, was taking that little higher here.

2095
02:10:42.14 --> 02:10:47.14
That little higher here as USA project, that that company met asses asked me to watch over, right?

2096
02:10:47.14 --> 02:10:51.14
Step one was, with certain to build some programs.

2097
02:10:51.14 --> 02:10:57.14
Step two was getting one of my best friends in the world who served with me, who was right next to that track as it burned.

2098
02:10:57.14 --> 02:11:09.14
Nate Smith, the come in, be my chief operating officer and build this amazing team and leveraging some of the media attention I got for fighting, leveraging it for our cause in building it.

2099
02:11:09.14 --> 02:11:14.14
And not just building a company where hey, we went out, we fundraised for our mission. No, that's bogus.

2100
02:11:14.14 --> 02:11:28.14
We were out there accomplishing the mission, helping veterans get legitimate jobs, careers, so that they can succeed and lead again, back here, home and in their communities,

2101
02:11:28.14 --> 02:11:36.14
and watching it grow from a team of five to a team of ten to a team of twenty to our now we've got ninety six full time employees.

2102
02:11:36.14 --> 02:11:41.14
And we're bringing in over three hundred veterans and spouses a week into the programs.

2103
02:11:41.14 --> 02:11:47.14
That was all built with this amazing team of people while I was still fighting.

2104
02:11:47.14 --> 02:11:57.14
That was my full time job doing that and having a board of directors that had the foresight and the perspective to say, hey, you know what?

2105
02:11:57.14 --> 02:12:05.14
Yes, you're going to be a little limited during some of these training camps, but what you're able to bring to our brand is helpful right now in the future.

2106
02:12:05.14 --> 02:12:22.14
Right now in the phase that this company is and it's been a wild and really amazing ride and some of the things we talked about earlier, where you have these things, these questions that will always haunt you about the loss of your friends, the loss of your dreams, the loss of your seals.

2107
02:12:22.14 --> 02:12:29.14
When you can lead an initiative like that, it helps you feel like, hey, you know what I am? I am taking advantage of every day.

2108
02:12:29.14 --> 02:12:36.14
Every day we're moving forward, we're achieving, we're helping other warriors now find success post military service.

2109
02:12:36.14 --> 02:12:43.14
And that's me earning it, my earning my day where they don't live a longer having, you know, Travis made into the living more.

2110
02:12:43.14 --> 02:12:48.14
And his family would give anything to see him one more time. I can't bring him back.

2111
02:12:48.14 --> 02:12:58.14
But I'll tell you what if I sat here crying about it, feeling sorry for myself that my friend Travis was gone, he'd be the first to slap the hell out of me when I die for her.

2112
02:12:58.14 --> 02:13:00.14
Or at least do a double leg on your ass.

2113
02:13:00.14 --> 02:13:05.14
He was, I'm telling you, man, that that was he planned on fighting when he got done that.

2114
02:13:05.14 --> 02:13:10.14
He'd still be fighting this day. He was a bad bad dude.

2115
02:13:10.14 --> 02:13:19.14
And that was your last fight in the UFC and he retired after you fought Mandalay Silva, which did you plan?

2116
02:13:19.14 --> 02:13:20.14
No.

2117
02:13:20.14 --> 02:13:23.14
To do that. So those of you that don't know that aren't an MMA.

2118
02:13:23.14 --> 02:13:28.14
There's a guy, a legendary, mixed martial artist named Van Delay Silva.

2119
02:13:28.14 --> 02:13:32.14
I saw him fight a few times in Japan back in the back in the day.

2120
02:13:32.14 --> 02:13:37.14
And he's a brawl. And he's incredible punching power.

2121
02:13:37.14 --> 02:13:41.14
And his nickname is the Axe Mergera because he looks like a psycho.

2122
02:13:41.14 --> 02:13:45.14
And anyways, Brian had a fight with him.

2123
02:13:45.14 --> 02:13:50.14
And these two guys went in there. It was like Russian roulette.

2124
02:13:50.14 --> 02:13:55.14
He was a street fight. And eventually you got caught.

2125
02:13:55.14 --> 02:13:58.14
You know, got caught by one of the best strikers that have ever been in the game.

2126
02:13:58.14 --> 02:14:04.14
And by the way, you dropped him a couple times.

2127
02:14:04.14 --> 02:14:06.14
You had that. You had it one.

2128
02:14:06.14 --> 02:14:11.14
But you definitely, you dropped him two or three times in the first round or twice in the first round.

2129
02:14:11.14 --> 02:14:12.14
He went back from the dead.

2130
02:14:12.14 --> 02:14:13.14
Yeah.

2131
02:14:13.14 --> 02:14:14.14
A minimum of two times.

2132
02:14:14.14 --> 02:14:16.14
The eyes were in the back of his head.

2133
02:14:16.14 --> 02:14:19.14
And then he just looked at me again with bloodshot eyes.

2134
02:14:19.14 --> 02:14:22.14
It was it was unbelievable unbelievable.

2135
02:14:22.14 --> 02:14:24.14
But no, that was not the plan.

2136
02:14:24.14 --> 02:14:29.14
And so the you were with Greg Jackson and we great.

2137
02:14:29.14 --> 02:14:30.14
I wasn't.

2138
02:14:30.14 --> 02:14:36.14
I so for the the out so cara bis being and van der Leif fight, I trained myself.

2139
02:14:36.14 --> 02:14:42.14
And the reason being was right after I had fought Chelsea on in two days before Christmas,

2140
02:14:42.14 --> 02:14:45.14
me and my wife. Land and baggage claim. And I get a call.

2141
02:14:45.14 --> 02:14:50.14
And in her little brother, who had struggled with bipolar disorder and depression.

2142
02:14:50.14 --> 02:14:52.14
And we didn't know that that right.

2143
02:14:52.14 --> 02:14:56.14
He had taken his own life went up to a cabin mill the woods and taken his own life and

2144
02:14:56.14 --> 02:14:58.14
had it tell my wife their baggage claim.

2145
02:14:58.14 --> 02:15:03.14
And her mom at the time was living with the, it was personal life was a mess.

2146
02:15:03.14 --> 02:15:04.14
Still got to pay bills though.

2147
02:15:04.14 --> 02:15:06.14
Right. Still got to company to run.

2148
02:15:06.14 --> 02:15:09.14
So I got to fight career that I've got to push through and I can't just hey, look,

2149
02:15:09.14 --> 02:15:13.14
I'm going to take seven months off here to get through this because I got bills to pay.

2150
02:15:13.14 --> 02:15:16.14
Anyways, it it caused me to start my own camp.

2151
02:15:16.14 --> 02:15:21.14
So that the game plan going in was hey, we're going to take van der Leif down a little bit

2152
02:15:21.14 --> 02:15:23.14
in this fight and disrupt him.

2153
02:15:23.14 --> 02:15:27.14
Really, really confuse him because nobody's nobody's used to me doing that.

2154
02:15:27.14 --> 02:15:28.14
Yeah.

2155
02:15:28.14 --> 02:15:30.14
And so I fly to Japan.

2156
02:15:30.14 --> 02:15:35.14
We get off the plane if that long flight after a long training camp where I absolutely

2157
02:15:35.14 --> 02:15:36.14
over trained.

2158
02:15:36.14 --> 02:15:40.14
And we get to the hotel and and and me and one of my striking coaches,

2159
02:15:40.14 --> 02:15:43.14
the top we go start hitting pads, we're hitting pads.

2160
02:15:43.14 --> 02:15:44.14
It pad works down in all man.

2161
02:15:44.14 --> 02:15:46.14
All of a sudden I start to cool down.

2162
02:15:46.14 --> 02:15:49.14
I can't lift my knee up in my left leg.

2163
02:15:49.14 --> 02:15:50.14
Tears something in my head.

2164
02:15:50.14 --> 02:15:52.14
And it happens.

2165
02:15:52.14 --> 02:15:55.14
I mean, van der Leick could have walked in there with how many miles he could have walked in a couple

2166
02:15:55.14 --> 02:15:56.14
of injuries.

2167
02:15:56.14 --> 02:15:59.14
So anyways, now this gets into my head a little bit.

2168
02:15:59.14 --> 02:16:02.14
And so I asked to see the UFC doctor.

2169
02:16:02.14 --> 02:16:06.14
And so as soon as he landed he was told that you got to go see Brian's status.

2170
02:16:06.14 --> 02:16:08.14
Hey, look, I've looked at all the stuff.

2171
02:16:08.14 --> 02:16:13.14
No vacay in his legal. I just want to get no vacay for fight night so I won't feel it.

2172
02:16:13.14 --> 02:16:17.14
And I'm walking around the hotel and I'm trying not to show anybody that I'm limping at the press conference.

2173
02:16:17.14 --> 02:16:19.14
Cause I have a legitimate limp.

2174
02:16:19.14 --> 02:16:22.14
And anyways, he's like, okay, we should but we're in Japan.

2175
02:16:22.14 --> 02:16:24.14
We're not in the second or third of a country.

2176
02:16:24.14 --> 02:16:25.14
We're in Tokyo, right?

2177
02:16:25.14 --> 02:16:27.14
I could have walked across the street probably gotten light a cane.

2178
02:16:27.14 --> 02:16:30.14
Anyways, suppose to get it, suppose to get it, suppose to get it, I'm going to get it.

2179
02:16:30.14 --> 02:16:30.14
I'm going to get it.

2180
02:16:30.14 --> 02:16:31.14
I'm going to get it.

2181
02:16:31.14 --> 02:16:32.14
It doesn't get it.

2182
02:16:32.14 --> 02:16:35.14
When you fight in Japan, the fights so that they could cater the American TV.

2183
02:16:35.14 --> 02:16:39.14
It's like 70 am. So he's sitting there sorry.

2184
02:16:39.14 --> 02:16:42.14
So I let that affect me too much mentally.

2185
02:16:42.14 --> 02:16:47.14
And we're trying to warm up backstage and I'm trying to shoot some double eggs and I'm not feeling it.

2186
02:16:47.14 --> 02:16:50.14
And in my own head, we're walking, like you know what?

2187
02:16:50.14 --> 02:16:52.14
This dude's got some miles on him.

2188
02:16:52.14 --> 02:16:53.14
I hit like a truck.

2189
02:16:53.14 --> 02:16:55.14
Let's get in there.

2190
02:16:55.14 --> 02:16:58.14
Let's knock this dude out and let's get this fight over with.

2191
02:16:58.14 --> 02:17:03.14
So ready to go walk out there and he tags me first.

2192
02:17:03.14 --> 02:17:07.14
He hits me behind the ear and you know most of Vandalace fights.

2193
02:17:07.14 --> 02:17:09.14
He's a little bit more of an accumulation guy.

2194
02:17:09.14 --> 02:17:11.14
He's not considered a one punch knock off guy.

2195
02:17:11.14 --> 02:17:13.14
This one right hand he hits me with.

2196
02:17:13.14 --> 02:17:16.14
I had never been rocked in the knock down before my life.

2197
02:17:16.14 --> 02:17:17.14
And he dropped me.

2198
02:17:17.14 --> 02:17:19.14
So he's like, all right, it's on.

2199
02:17:19.14 --> 02:17:20.14
Let's go.

2200
02:17:20.14 --> 02:17:21.14
And so then I rock him.

2201
02:17:21.14 --> 02:17:23.14
And once I rocked him, I thought, okay,

2202
02:17:23.14 --> 02:17:27.14
one more good shot on the chin and he's done.

2203
02:17:27.14 --> 02:17:31.14
And I landed it and he'd go down and then he come back.

2204
02:17:31.14 --> 02:17:37.14
And I'm just caught up and so the second round I start to get a little bit more technical and move around a little bit.

2205
02:17:37.14 --> 02:17:39.14
Like, all right, he's obviously not going away.

2206
02:17:39.14 --> 02:17:41.14
I've got to take a different approach.

2207
02:17:41.14 --> 02:17:43.14
I don't know what this guy's made of.

2208
02:17:43.14 --> 02:17:45.14
And then he, I didn't even, I don't remember.

2209
02:17:45.14 --> 02:17:47.14
You know, I caught with that huge punch.

2210
02:17:47.14 --> 02:17:49.14
Don't remember any of it.

2211
02:17:49.14 --> 02:17:52.14
And it's crazy, but I realized I lost.

2212
02:17:52.14 --> 02:17:57.14
I came to as John Annick, who's one of my closest friends.

2213
02:17:57.14 --> 02:17:59.14
Now comes up to with a microphone.

2214
02:17:59.14 --> 02:18:02.14
And I realized, well, I don't remember winning.

2215
02:18:02.14 --> 02:18:05.14
So I'm much less flied.

2216
02:18:05.14 --> 02:18:07.14
And it was a horrible flight home.

2217
02:18:07.14 --> 02:18:10.14
I'm sitting there flying home.

2218
02:18:10.14 --> 02:18:13.14
And I had a jack and coke in my hand.

2219
02:18:13.14 --> 02:18:14.14
Couldn't sleep at all.

2220
02:18:14.14 --> 02:18:15.14
Didn't sleep.

2221
02:18:15.14 --> 02:18:17.14
And I am miserable.

2222
02:18:17.14 --> 02:18:19.14
I lost to a guy I was supposed to be.

2223
02:18:19.14 --> 02:18:21.14
Who's supposed to be washed up.

2224
02:18:21.14 --> 02:18:23.14
You know, I had pretty much made the decision.

2225
02:18:23.14 --> 02:18:25.14
Then, you know, I'm out.

2226
02:18:25.14 --> 02:18:26.14
It's over.

2227
02:18:26.14 --> 02:18:28.14
If you're not going to get busy being the champion,

2228
02:18:28.14 --> 02:18:33.14
there's other areas where that need my attention more from my family to the company.

2229
02:18:33.14 --> 02:18:34.14
I'm trying to run.

2230
02:18:34.14 --> 02:18:35.14
It was a hard decision.

2231
02:18:35.14 --> 02:18:38.14
And in part of me when I made the decision thought for sure,

2232
02:18:38.14 --> 02:18:40.14
I'm definitely going to come back, right?

2233
02:18:40.14 --> 02:18:41.14
I'm going to come back.

2234
02:18:41.14 --> 02:18:44.14
And for like two years, I held onto that and had to fight against it.

2235
02:18:44.14 --> 02:18:47.14
Like, no, it is not in your best interest to come back anymore.

2236
02:18:47.14 --> 02:18:50.14
It's in your, you do a better job talking about the microphone.

2237
02:18:50.14 --> 02:18:51.14
And then you're going to do strap.

2238
02:18:51.14 --> 02:18:52.14
And it gloves on anymore.

2239
02:18:52.14 --> 02:18:54.14
You're 35, now I'm 36.

2240
02:18:54.14 --> 02:18:55.14
It's over.

2241
02:18:55.14 --> 02:18:57.14
That makes me feel real good over here.

2242
02:18:57.14 --> 02:19:02.14
So, you know, we've been going for a while.

2243
02:19:02.14 --> 02:19:06.14
Tell us about like specifically with with higher heroes.

2244
02:19:06.14 --> 02:19:08.14
What, how can people support that?

2245
02:19:08.14 --> 02:19:09.14
What do we look for it?

2246
02:19:09.14 --> 02:19:10.14
All that stuff.

2247
02:19:10.14 --> 02:19:11.14
So that way people have information on it.

2248
02:19:11.14 --> 02:19:15.14
Yes, we've got a website higher heroes USA.org.

2249
02:19:15.14 --> 02:19:19.14
And if you are a service member or spouse who need to help finding a career

2250
02:19:19.14 --> 02:19:22.14
if you're unemployed or under employed, you go on there,

2251
02:19:22.14 --> 02:19:26.14
you're registered and we'll get you your personal veteran transition specialist.

2252
02:19:26.14 --> 02:19:28.14
Fancy term for a job coach.

2253
02:19:28.14 --> 02:19:31.14
And we'll take you through the whole thing from revising your resume

2254
02:19:31.14 --> 02:19:34.14
to teach how to effectively do a job search,

2255
02:19:34.14 --> 02:19:35.14
how to interview for a job.

2256
02:19:35.14 --> 02:19:38.14
We will help you if not build your LinkedIn site for you.

2257
02:19:38.14 --> 02:19:42.14
Teach you how to use that to impact and expand your network.

2258
02:19:42.14 --> 02:19:43.14
Do social media audits.

2259
02:19:43.14 --> 02:19:45.14
Hey, what pictures and posts,

2260
02:19:45.14 --> 02:19:47.14
is you not have up on Facebook right now?

2261
02:19:47.14 --> 02:19:51.14
You know, take a look at no big pop of pump at Yahoo is not your email anymore.

2262
02:19:51.14 --> 02:19:54.14
It's going to be Christina Smith at Yahoo.com.

2263
02:19:54.14 --> 02:19:57.14
All the dudes that don't.

2264
02:19:57.14 --> 02:20:00.14
But then we have a job where a lot of corporate partners will match you to all those companies.

2265
02:20:00.14 --> 02:20:04.14
So people, if people want a higher a veteran,

2266
02:20:04.14 --> 02:20:06.14
they can go through you as well.

2267
02:20:06.14 --> 02:20:08.14
Because that's the one thing I get hit with a lot is,

2268
02:20:08.14 --> 02:20:10.14
you know, people say, how can we help veterans?

2269
02:20:10.14 --> 02:20:11.14
And I say higher veterans.

2270
02:20:11.14 --> 02:20:12.14
And they say, where do we find them?

2271
02:20:12.14 --> 02:20:13.14
So now we've got a good place to have.

2272
02:20:13.14 --> 02:20:14.14
Absolutely.

2273
02:20:14.14 --> 02:20:17.14
When we were bringing it over 300 people a week in the program,

2274
02:20:17.14 --> 02:20:21.14
we're all going to get one on one assistance and different from any other nonprofit.

2275
02:20:21.14 --> 02:20:25.14
Everything we do is track, logged and analyzed and sales force.

2276
02:20:25.14 --> 02:20:27.14
So that we can hold ourselves accountable.

2277
02:20:27.14 --> 02:20:31.14
I can hold every one of my employees accountable for the workload they have.

2278
02:20:31.14 --> 02:20:35.14
They all have weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual metrics that they have to hit.

2279
02:20:35.14 --> 02:20:36.14
They don't hit them.

2280
02:20:36.14 --> 02:20:38.14
They no longer work here.

2281
02:20:38.14 --> 02:20:41.14
We run this nonprofit like a business because people don't

2282
02:20:41.14 --> 02:20:43.14
make money to us to help veterans find careers.

2283
02:20:43.14 --> 02:20:44.14
Period.

2284
02:20:44.14 --> 02:20:46.14
And if we're not doing that, then we go away.

2285
02:20:46.14 --> 02:20:48.14
And I take that very serious,

2286
02:20:48.14 --> 02:20:53.14
and it's what's allowed us to grow from a team of four to now a team of 96.

2287
02:20:53.14 --> 02:20:55.14
It will continue to do so.

2288
02:20:55.14 --> 02:21:00.14
And my main mission now is to make sure higher here as you say is there for the next generation of combat veterans as well.

2289
02:21:00.14 --> 02:21:04.14
When they return home to a society that doesn't understand them as much.

2290
02:21:04.14 --> 02:21:13.14
And in the real help, the real need is for the veteran to learn how to communicate their skills at how to deliver their value proposition.

2291
02:21:13.14 --> 02:21:14.14
It's a hard thing to do.

2292
02:21:14.14 --> 02:21:16.14
Think about your seals when they got out.

2293
02:21:16.14 --> 02:21:19.14
If they went to a job or try to write a resume, what the hell do I put?

2294
02:21:19.14 --> 02:21:22.14
My first resume looked like I was trying to get a job as a mercenary.

2295
02:21:22.14 --> 02:21:23.14
Me was off.

2296
02:21:23.14 --> 02:21:25.14
And I was in Naval Academy, I'm a man.

2297
02:21:25.14 --> 02:21:28.14
Imagine these young sailors, you know?

2298
02:21:28.14 --> 02:21:28.14
Yeah.

2299
02:21:28.14 --> 02:21:33.14
And over 80% of the people we help at higher here are your young and listed service members.

2300
02:21:33.14 --> 02:21:34.14
The ones who need us the most.

2301
02:21:34.14 --> 02:21:35.14
Awesome.

2302
02:21:35.14 --> 02:21:36.14
Awesome.

2303
02:21:36.14 --> 02:21:39.14
And then you got the Guardian project going on.

2304
02:21:39.14 --> 02:21:40.14
Incredible project.

2305
02:21:40.14 --> 02:21:43.14
And I'd love to to get these guys down.

2306
02:21:43.14 --> 02:21:47.14
Ben Covax who's our executive director come down and be on your show someday.

2307
02:21:47.14 --> 02:21:51.14
It's it's so in line with some of your beliefs on martial arts and you jits you.

2308
02:21:51.14 --> 02:21:56.14
Ben has a vision that every kid should have the opportunity to train martial arts.

2309
02:21:56.14 --> 02:21:57.14
Every child.

2310
02:21:57.14 --> 02:21:58.14
Yeah.

2311
02:21:58.14 --> 02:22:03.14
And so he went out, networked and found a man by the name of Joel on in Feld.

2312
02:22:03.14 --> 02:22:06.14
Who's on my board at higher heroes who's an executive at Twitter.

2313
02:22:06.14 --> 02:22:12.14
And they bought a property in Oakland where there are a lot of young men and women who don't have much going on after school.

2314
02:22:12.14 --> 02:22:15.14
And they don't they the chips are stacked against them.

2315
02:22:15.14 --> 02:22:17.14
There's not a whole lot that they have.

2316
02:22:17.14 --> 02:22:21.14
You know, they're families of a hard time making money and there's a lot of children get into.

2317
02:22:21.14 --> 02:22:24.14
And they go find them and they bring them in and they come.

2318
02:22:24.14 --> 02:22:25.14
They train martial arts.

2319
02:22:25.14 --> 02:22:26.14
They train jitzu.

2320
02:22:26.14 --> 02:22:27.14
They train boxing.

2321
02:22:27.14 --> 02:22:28.14
They do their homework.

2322
02:22:28.14 --> 02:22:33.14
And then they have networked with local restaurants and they get a healthy meal afterwards for free.

2323
02:22:33.14 --> 02:22:38.14
In many cases, these are the health the only healthy meal that that young man or woman's going to get that day.

2324
02:22:38.14 --> 02:22:46.14
They have regular members to the gym, but those members pay a membership fee that also then pays for those young kids that they can come for free.

2325
02:22:46.14 --> 02:22:48.14
People buy a key for themselves.

2326
02:22:48.14 --> 02:22:50.14
Then they get a free key for one of the kids.

2327
02:22:50.14 --> 02:22:59.14
I've gone there and taught and ran some classes and it is just it's incredible to meet these young men and women who haven't been given much in life.

2328
02:22:59.14 --> 02:23:02.14
Their parents are grateful because now they're not paying for after school care.

2329
02:23:02.14 --> 02:23:04.14
They can't afford it anyways and their kids not wander in the streets.

2330
02:23:04.14 --> 02:23:11.14
Right. But now they've got this place to go to where there's like minded people pushing them to do better.

2331
02:23:11.14 --> 02:23:18.14
Don't allow your circumstances to direct and direct your life until you who you're going to be.

2332
02:23:18.14 --> 02:23:20.14
Nothing should hold you back.

2333
02:23:20.14 --> 02:23:28.14
So the discipline that they're learning now, the camaraderie that character they're learning at Guardian, is starting to spill into the other aspects of their life.

2334
02:23:28.14 --> 02:23:30.14
Their grades are going up.

2335
02:23:30.14 --> 02:23:31.14
They're being more nutritious.

2336
02:23:31.14 --> 02:23:36.14
They're focused on their future. They're, hey, wait a minute. College. I can go. I can go to college.

2337
02:23:36.14 --> 02:23:45.14
They've got these great positive inspirations around in the goal is to take Guardian from Oakland and start to to brand it and get it in gyms across the country.

2338
02:23:45.14 --> 02:23:52.14
Where now we don't need a physical facility to do it. And other gyms can take on the program where now we've got a system where they can adopt it.

2339
02:23:52.14 --> 02:23:59.14
And people can pay their membership as part of a way of paying the membership for these under privileged kids to go there and train after school as well.

2340
02:23:59.14 --> 02:24:09.14
So they can have a chance just because their port, as it mean they shouldn't get the opportunity to train you to train boxing, to get all the character development that goes along with martial arts.

2341
02:24:09.14 --> 02:24:16.14
Yeah, that's all I got. I actually, I got another book coming out in the book is called The Way of the War Your Kid and it's a kids book.

2342
02:24:16.14 --> 02:24:20.14
And it's basically about a young kid who's getting picked on at school.

2343
02:24:20.14 --> 02:24:27.14
He can't do any pull-ups. He, he doesn't know his time stables and is basically miserable, right?

2344
02:24:27.14 --> 02:24:35.14
And anyways, school ends and his uncle Jake comes out to stay with him for the summer. Uncle Jake is a team guy.

2345
02:24:35.14 --> 02:24:40.14
So Uncle Jake says, oh, you got some issues. What are the issues? I can't do pull-ups because we can fix all those things.

2346
02:24:40.14 --> 02:24:46.14
So one of the, you know, obviously gets more working out. Oh, you're getting bullied because he's getting bullied badly.

2347
02:24:46.14 --> 02:24:48.14
Well, guess what he's going to learn. He's going to learn.

2348
02:24:48.14 --> 02:24:54.14
You, jitsu. So I honestly think there's going to be a little bit of the surge of jitsu in America.

2349
02:24:54.14 --> 02:25:03.14
I love it. And it's like, this is right up the right up that alley. It is. And you know, when, when that comes out, we're going to grab a bunch of make it mandatory for these kids.

2350
02:25:03.14 --> 02:25:08.14
Things like that inspire them. I mean, they make a difference. When you look at the, just the social, economic impact.

2351
02:25:08.14 --> 02:25:18.14
Young man or woman who has a high likelihood of probably getting arrested, especially when you look at some of the, the problems we have with our criminal justice system, right?

2352
02:25:18.14 --> 02:25:24.14
Now, instead, they have a positive environment. Never get, they go in a college and they go get a great job and they're contributing. They're winning now.

2353
02:25:24.14 --> 02:25:39.14
Huge impact for our country, for our communities to do that and to get more jitsu, more martial arts and some of these, these poor, super rural areas in our country where there's extreme poverty and our super urban areas where there's extreme poverty.

2354
02:25:39.14 --> 02:25:48.14
Where these young men and women don't get that opportunity because their parents can't pay a hundred fifty dollars a month for them to go and they don't have any positive influences in their life.

2355
02:25:48.14 --> 02:25:53.14
Man, that, that, that can fix a lot of problems that we have going on in our country.

2356
02:25:53.14 --> 02:25:57.14
There's no doubt. Does, is there a way to help the Guardian project right now?

2357
02:25:57.14 --> 02:26:06.14
Go to go to GuardianProject.org. There's a website right there. You could become a monthly sponsor. I mean, that organization is, is, is, in startup phase.

2358
02:26:06.14 --> 02:26:14.14
If someone could give five to ten dollars a month to them, that is a huge portion of a young man or woman's monthly membership.

2359
02:26:14.14 --> 02:26:18.14
Right. They have to go to that gym. Get a free meal. Have someone looking at the report card.

2360
02:26:18.14 --> 02:26:22.14
Tutor in the men math. Teach them jitsu. Confidence.

2361
02:26:22.14 --> 02:26:31.14
I mean, we got young ladies in there and, and they're in there. They're confidence when they start dating and who they choose and how that, I mean, the way they're going to approach life.

2362
02:26:31.14 --> 02:26:39.14
These young men in understanding how to respect and train with the young lady. I'm going to grapple with you this round and how to respect you.

2363
02:26:39.14 --> 02:26:45.14
I mean, it's, it's amazing to watch what's happening at a young age and how quickly they're developing it's awesome.

2364
02:26:45.14 --> 02:26:53.14
That's awesome. So higher heroes, the Guardian project, organizations to support.

2365
02:26:53.14 --> 02:27:02.14
And guess that kind of wraps it with us. If anybody wanted to support this podcast echo Charles.

2366
02:27:02.14 --> 02:27:07.14
I have a question. Oh, echo comes with a deep question. Got a question. Kind of deep.

2367
02:27:07.14 --> 02:27:13.14
So when you watch a few good men, are you like on the side of the Marines like the whole week?

2368
02:27:13.14 --> 02:27:23.14
I'm saying don't group me with them just because I wear the same uniform. The, you know, a few good men. He's going against the Navy Tom Cruise and Avie guy.

2369
02:27:23.14 --> 02:27:31.14
You're not a seal, but you know, so I am when I watch a few good men. I am with the Marines all the way up until they break their integrity.

2370
02:27:31.14 --> 02:27:38.14
All right, which is a movie, right? But, but under no circumstances should we break our integrity and that's a problem.

2371
02:27:38.14 --> 02:27:46.14
That's it's so false. No kernel would tell someone one thing then tell this to you and your guy over here. No, you go to this and then lie about it and try and cover up.

2372
02:27:46.14 --> 02:27:47.14
The big cover up. Yeah.

2373
02:27:47.14 --> 02:27:52.14
Good cover up. Remember when they break their integrity, that's I don't care what uniform you're wearing. That's a problem.

2374
02:27:52.14 --> 02:27:59.14
Or if you're not wearing a uniform at all, if we just talked about that on the last podcast, main day in the integrity.

2375
02:27:59.14 --> 02:28:03.14
It's true. Oh, follow up. Question. Is there such thing as a code read?

2376
02:28:03.14 --> 02:28:05.14
No. Okay. There's no such thing.

2377
02:28:05.14 --> 02:28:12.14
Anyway, so support. Right. We can talk about that. If you guys like cool. Yeah. Let's do it.

2378
02:28:12.14 --> 02:28:17.14
Right. All right. Well, uh, and let's do it fast.

2422
02:31:45.14 --> 02:31:51.14
I roll out of bed on a sedan. Yeah. Go accomplish something. Get in the game. Yep. Very well put. Yes.

2423
02:31:51.14 --> 02:31:57.14
So yeah, check out those shirts. I'm not saying buy a shirt. I'm not sitting here and saying buy a shirt. I'm saying go in. Go on.

2424
02:31:57.14 --> 02:32:04.14
No website. Jockel store.com. Look at the shirts. If you like the shirts. And you want to support the podcast.

2425
02:32:04.14 --> 02:32:14.14
Get a shirt. It's on you. There's some rash guards in there. So you can, you know, some some physical activity grappling surfing.

2426
02:32:14.14 --> 02:32:19.14
Crought anything. You know, anything they do a lot of physical activity. And he written your motion.

2427
02:32:19.14 --> 02:32:27.14
Rashes guards. Good. Good. Patches. Good. Regulation size or not regulations. Good. All good. Anyway.

2428
02:32:27.14 --> 02:32:36.14
And about these mugs. These mugs better be on there. Oh, yeah. The mugs. Unfortunately. I got a bunch of them made and we sold them on Amazon.

2429
02:32:36.14 --> 02:32:44.14
And we had a bunch in stock and then Joe Rogan posted a picture of his and then they were gone. And they're on the same head to be. Yeah. I got more coming.

2430
02:32:44.14 --> 02:32:45.14
Yeah. Yeah.

2431
02:32:45.14 --> 02:32:56.14
The map like early March. I think I a tweet up before we started the show just just show the desk with all the weapons on it. The amount of testosterone in jawline in here is massive.

2432
02:32:56.14 --> 02:33:01.14
We're going to do the softest right now.

2433
02:33:01.14 --> 02:33:09.14
Yeah. But yeah, those I think what March right, too, is like I think early March. I think they'll be a real

2434
02:33:09.14 --> 02:33:13.14
person or something like that. And still work it on the international for the mugs, right?

2435
02:33:13.14 --> 02:33:21.14
Yeah, probably. So thank we're going to make that happen. So stand by for that. Also, okay. Psychological warfare. I like to feel something.

2436
02:33:21.14 --> 02:33:28.14
I don't need this anymore. I'm over it. But if you do need psychological warfare, okay. Here's what it is.

2437
02:33:28.14 --> 02:33:37.14
You ever have those days where you're like, you're about to work out or you plan to work out. And you're like, you know, maybe I'll just work out tomorrow.

2438
02:33:37.14 --> 02:33:46.14
Everybody has you absolutely right. Yes. So what you do is you get this album that we put together. Well, it's a chocolate talk.

2439
02:33:46.14 --> 02:33:52.14
I just kind of recorded it. But like I said echo presses record better than anybody.

2440
02:33:52.14 --> 02:33:54.14
Yeah, it's true. Absolutely.

2441
02:33:54.14 --> 02:34:01.14
But on iTunes, you can get like a track. Like if your thing is like, I eat donuts way too much. And you're like, I'm going to fight the donut or whatever.

2442
02:34:01.14 --> 02:34:05.14
You can just get that track. It's called what sugar coated lies. That's for example.

2443
02:34:05.14 --> 02:34:09.14
It's just Jaco's voice telling you why not eat the donut. Yeah, love this.

2444
02:34:09.14 --> 02:34:15.14
Yeah, I don't actually, you don't need to your voice is so stern and intense.

2445
02:34:15.14 --> 02:34:21.14
It doesn't matter. Absolutely, right? Yeah. It's like Batman. Right? No, I shouldn't bail Batman.

2446
02:34:21.14 --> 02:34:24.14
Don't eat the donut. That's more late.

2447
02:34:24.14 --> 02:34:28.14
Laces Batman, of course. You're kind of like, um, I don't know.

2448
02:34:28.14 --> 02:34:34.14
I don't know. I don't know. Either way, there's a bunch of them know it's cool like that's not wake up in the morning.

2449
02:34:34.14 --> 02:34:37.14
Anyway, it's good, man. It helps. It helps a lot.

2450
02:34:37.14 --> 02:34:41.14
It's been very well received. I think surprisingly. Yeah. I was kind of surprised.

2451
02:34:41.14 --> 02:34:45.14
Yeah. So as Echo thought it was a good idea. You know, man, people need this.

2452
02:34:45.14 --> 02:34:49.14
I'm like, people need two minutes of me talking about donut. I need it. That's what I said.

2453
02:34:49.14 --> 02:34:50.14
To go work out.

2454
02:34:50.14 --> 02:34:57.14
But what's greater than you do and send me in like, there's no way I can sleep through because one of the first track is called

2455
02:34:57.14 --> 02:35:05.14
Wake Up and get after it because I think that really one of the easiest ways to start developing discipline in your life is to wake up early in the morning.

2456
02:35:05.14 --> 02:35:09.14
So the first track is Wake Up and get after it and I actually do it account to 10.

2457
02:35:09.14 --> 02:35:11.14
And then give you the opportunity 10 seconds.

2458
02:35:11.14 --> 02:35:13.14
Fair enough to get out of bed.

2459
02:35:13.14 --> 02:35:15.14
If not out of bed by then we got issues.

2460
02:35:15.14 --> 02:35:21.14
It's fun.

2461
02:35:21.14 --> 02:35:24.14
Anything else?

2462
02:35:24.14 --> 02:35:28.14
Along with that, if you want to get some jockel white tea, yeah, it's available.

2463
02:35:28.14 --> 02:35:30.14
It's available in stock on Amazon.

2464
02:35:30.14 --> 02:35:34.14
And before I was hesitant because at one time I said, hey, we'll never sell out of it again.

2465
02:35:34.14 --> 02:35:37.14
And everybody that listens to this podcast bought it that day.

2466
02:35:37.14 --> 02:35:41.14
We sold out in 10 minutes because we sold out the first time and that's a normal.

2467
02:35:41.14 --> 02:35:42.14
Just going to get a ton.

2468
02:35:42.14 --> 02:35:44.14
I said, don't worry guys. We'll never sell out again.

2469
02:35:44.14 --> 02:35:45.14
Yeah, we sold out again.

2470
02:35:45.14 --> 02:35:49.14
Now I'm feeling pretty confident that we won't sell out again.

2471
02:35:49.14 --> 02:35:51.14
That means I went cut a record.

2472
02:35:51.14 --> 02:35:52.14
That's what I want.

2473
02:35:52.14 --> 02:35:54.14
I over engineered the whole thing.

2474
02:35:54.14 --> 02:35:57.14
So we shouldn't sell out of jockel white tea again.

2475
02:35:57.14 --> 02:35:59.14
You can get it on Amazon.

2476
02:35:59.14 --> 02:36:02.14

2477
02:36:02.14 --> 02:36:06.14

You will dig this book.

2501
02:36:55.14 --> 02:36:56.14
I dig this book.

2502
02:36:56.14 --> 02:36:58.14
I wrote it.

2503
02:36:58.14 --> 02:36:59.14
And I like it.

2504
02:36:59.14 --> 02:37:00.14
I like to read it.

02:37:00.14 --> 02:37:02.14
My nine-year-old daughter's reading it.

2506
02:37:02.14 --> 02:37:05.14
Oh yeah, yeah, it's good.

2507
02:37:05.14 --> 02:37:07.14
I'll leave it at that.

2508
02:37:07.14 --> 02:37:08.14
And I'm not a person to sit there and say,

2509
02:37:08.14 --> 02:37:10.14
Oh, what I did is really good.

2510
02:37:10.14 --> 02:37:11.14
I don't do that.

2511
02:37:11.14 --> 02:37:13.14
I like this book a lot.

2512
02:37:13.14 --> 02:37:15.14

You can get it.

2517
02:37:21.14 --> 02:37:23.14
We talk about war.

2518
02:37:23.14 --> 02:37:25.14
And we talk about leadership.

2519
02:37:25.14 --> 02:37:26.14
And we talk about war.

2520
02:37:26.14 --> 02:37:28.14
You know, what else would we talk about?

2521
02:37:28.14 --> 02:37:30.14
If the right one, not one of the spin-offs.

2522
02:37:30.14 --> 02:37:31.14
Yeah, I think.

2523
02:37:31.14 --> 02:37:32.14
All right.

2524
02:37:32.14 --> 02:37:35.14
Lastly, Extreme Ownership Monster.

02:37:35.14 --> 02:37:39.14
May 4th and 5th at the Marriott Markey in New York City.

2526
02:37:39.14 --> 02:37:40.14
Extreme Ownership Monster.

2527
02:37:40.14 --> 02:37:41.14
Number two, by the way.

2528
02:37:41.14 --> 02:37:43.14
Number one already happened in San Diego.

2529
02:37:43.14 --> 02:37:44.14
It was awesome.

2530
02:37:44.14 --> 02:37:45.14
This one's going to be awesome.

2531
02:37:45.14 --> 02:37:47.14
By the way, I'm going to say this yet about Extreme Ownership

2532
02:37:47.14 --> 02:37:48.14

2533
02:37:48.14 --> 02:37:49.14

02:37:51.14 --> 02:37:53.14
Echo Charles will be there.

2536
02:37:53.14 --> 02:37:56.14

2537
02:37:56.14 --> 02:37:58.14
We will be there is no backstage.

2538
02:37:58.14 --> 02:37:59.14
We will be upfront.

2539
02:37:59.14 --> 02:38:01.14
I will be sitting at your table.

2540
02:38:01.14 --> 02:38:03.14
We will be talking about things.

2541
02:38:03.14 --> 02:38:06.14
JP Denel is going to be there as well.

2542
02:38:06.14 --> 02:38:08.14

So come on out to that May 4th and 5th.

There's a video coming out about it soon.

2545
02:38:12.14 --> 02:38:14.14
I warned you that when the video comes out,

2546
02:38:14.14 --> 02:38:19.14
it's going to sell out because Echo Charles makes these videos so persuasive.

2547
02:38:19.14 --> 02:38:22.14
That everyone's going to come.

2548
02:38:22.14 --> 02:38:25.14
And while you're waiting for the monster,

2549
02:38:25.14 --> 02:38:30.14
you can still carry on this conversation with us on the into webs.

2550
02:38:30.14 --> 02:38:33.14
On Twitter, on Instagram.

2551
02:38:33.14 --> 02:38:35.14
And when you're going to look at that face,

2552
02:38:35.14 --> 02:38:36.14
Brokey Boha.

2553
02:38:36.14 --> 02:38:38.14
We're going to be on that one too.

2554
02:38:38.14 --> 02:38:41.14
So Echo is at Echo Charles.

2555
02:38:41.14 --> 02:38:43.14
I am at Jockel Willink.

02:38:43.14 --> 02:38:46.14
And Brian Stan is at Brian Stan.

2557
02:38:46.14 --> 02:38:47.14
I keep it simple.

2558
02:38:47.14 --> 02:38:48.14
I like how you do it.

2559
02:38:48.14 --> 02:38:50.14
Two ends on Stan.

2560
02:38:50.14 --> 02:38:53.14
By the way, Echo Charles, you got any clothing thoughts?

2561
02:38:53.14 --> 02:38:55.14

2562
02:38:55.14 --> 02:38:57.14
Man, my man, good to meet you and have you.

Hey, Pleasure and honor.

Thank you so much for having me on.

2568
02:39:03.14 --> 02:39:06.14
We know we've been trying to do this for probably over a year now.

2569
02:39:06.14 --> 02:39:07.14
Well worth it.

2570
02:39:07.14 --> 02:39:08.14
And you've got a new subscriber.

2571
02:39:08.14 --> 02:39:09.14
I've got to listen to more of this.

2572
02:39:09.14 --> 02:39:12.14
I mean, we talk about a lot of things that we think we already know.

2573
02:39:12.14 --> 02:39:15.14
But man, it's motivating, though, when you continue to hear it,

2574
02:39:15.14 --> 02:39:16.14
you continue to hear it.

2575
02:39:16.14 --> 02:39:18.14
And you hear like, my people out there achieving.

2576
02:39:18.14 --> 02:39:19.14
Awesome.

02:39:19.14 --> 02:39:20.14
Thanks.

2578
02:39:20.14 --> 02:39:21.14
Thanks for coming on.

2579
02:39:21.14 --> 02:39:25.14
And I would like to thank everyone for listening.

2580
02:39:25.14 --> 02:39:29.14

Thanks to you for keeping us safe.

For those of you that are just out there on the grind, working hard and doing good work.

02:40:00.14 --> 02:40:02.14
Go ahead and keep doing that.

2589
02:40:02.14 --> 02:40:05.14
Good work.

2590
02:40:05.14 --> 02:40:08.14
And Brian.

2591
02:40:08.14 --> 02:40:10.14
Thanks for coming on.

2592
02:40:10.14 --> 02:40:13.14
Thanks for your career in the octagon.

2593
02:40:13.14 --> 02:40:18.14
Thanks for what you're doing now with the charity and helping vets.

2594
02:40:18.14 --> 02:40:25.14
But most of all, thanks for your service to this great nation.

2595
02:40:25.14 --> 02:40:36.14
And to your fellow Marines, who I was always humbled to serve alongside.

2596
02:40:36.14 --> 02:40:38.14
Thanks to you.

2597
02:40:38.14 --> 02:40:47.14
You proud leather necks for your service and sacrifice and forever upholding your motto.

2598
02:40:47.14 --> 02:40:51.14
Your motto, Semper Fidelas.

2599
02:40:51.14 --> 02:40:55.14
Always faithful.

2600
02:40:55.14 --> 02:41:09.14
And when we go forward each of us, all of us, when we go forward in our lives.

2601
02:41:09.14 --> 02:41:16.14
Let us do so with the intention of honoring those brave,

2602
02:41:16.14 --> 02:41:28.14
souls, those soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who stood and held the line.

2603
02:41:28.14 --> 02:41:43.14
And gave their last full measure for us.

2604
02:41:43.14 --> 02:41:52.14
So until next time, this is Brian, and echo, and juggle.

2605
02:41:52.14 --> 02:42:18.14
Out.
