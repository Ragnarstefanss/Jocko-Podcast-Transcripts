[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 60.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:08] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:15] What I am about to relate is anything but a pleasant story.
[00:00:21] In fact, it is so very unpleasant that I cannot recommend anyone without a strong stomach
[00:00:27] to read it.
[00:00:30] For it is a story of such crime and horror as to almost be unbelievable.
[00:00:37] The story of depredations of a horde of degraded criminals of incredible beastiality on a
[00:00:45] peaceful, kindly law-abiding people.
[00:00:51] I believe it has no parallel in modern history.
[00:00:59] And that is a warning that was written by a man by the name of George Fitch, who was an
[00:01:08] American in the city of Nanking, China.
[00:01:13] He was working for the YMCA in 1937 when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded.
[00:01:24] I am going to tell you that that warning is not strong enough.
[00:01:29] I know that many of you listen to this podcast with your children.
[00:01:37] And I am going to tell you right now, this podcast, this episode is not for children.
[00:01:47] This episode is barely even for adults.
[00:01:54] And I am sure that some of you will not make it through this podcast.
[00:02:01] I almost decided not to do it.
[00:02:07] This podcast, this episode is going to review a book called The Raper of Nanking by an author
[00:02:17] by the name of Iris Chang.
[00:02:20] And part of the reason that I decided that I had to cover this book is because of the
[00:02:31] story that follows the story.
[00:02:36] And that is of Iris Chang, the author, a bright, beautiful, intelligent, successful
[00:02:46] and loving woman who was consumed by darkness.
[00:02:56] And I will discuss her fate in a book that was written by her mother, Ying Ying Chang,
[00:03:04] in a book called The Woman Who Could Not Forget.
[00:03:11] And what happened in the city of Nanking is it is beyond darkness.
[00:03:21] It is beyond evil.
[00:03:26] It is pure savagery, wanton savagery of the highest order.
[00:03:38] And part of me thinks maybe it's best if it is forgotten.
[00:03:46] Maybe that's the best way to prevent it from happening again.
[00:03:51] But part of me knows that that is wrong.
[00:03:58] And the only way to learn is to study and to understand and to try and banish this from
[00:04:12] our memories to me that leaves a door.
[00:04:19] Leave a door open for something like this to happen again, somewhere, sometime.
[00:04:30] But I want to warn you again that there are parts of this episode that are extremely
[00:04:37] graphic.
[00:04:41] And I didn't put it all in there, but I absolutely wanted people to understand that this
[00:04:48] is what happened.
[00:04:49] And I feel compelled to discuss it for one for Iris Chang who in my mind sacrificed everything
[00:05:00] to tell the story to help ensure that those who suffered all remembered.
[00:05:10] And also to ensure that the human race at large has the knowledge, has the warning that
[00:05:21] evil exists.
[00:05:26] And that mankind is capable of becoming engulfed in that evil.
[00:05:36] And that man can act without mercy or remorse or the slightest shred of humanity at all.
[00:06:05] Go into the book.
[00:06:08] To prepare for the inevitable war with China, Japan had spent decades training its men
[00:06:14] for combat.
[00:06:16] The molding of young men deserve in the Japanese military began early in life.
[00:06:21] And in the 1930s the Marshall Influenced Seept into every aspect of Japanese boyhood.
[00:06:28] Toy shops became virtual shrines to war, selling arsenals of toy soldiers, tanks, helmets,
[00:06:35] uniforms, rifles, anti-aircraft guns, bugles, and hawardsers.
[00:06:41] Memoirs from that time describe preadolescent boys waging mock battles in the streets,
[00:06:48] using bamboo poles as imaginary rifles.
[00:06:52] Some even tied logs of wood on their back and fantasized about dying as human bomb heroes
[00:07:00] in suicide missions.
[00:07:04] And I can tell you, I grew up doing all that stuff.
[00:07:08] We played war all the time.
[00:07:12] All the time.
[00:07:13] So I don't find anything shocking about that.
[00:07:19] Back to the book, Japanese schools operated like miniature military units.
[00:07:23] Indeed, some of the teachers were military officers who lectured students on their duty
[00:07:28] to help Japan fulfill its divine destiny of conquering Asia and being able to stand up
[00:07:35] to the world's nations as a people second to none.
[00:07:39] Now we're starting to get off course.
[00:07:45] They taught young boys how to handle wooden models of guns and older boys how to handle
[00:07:49] real ones.
[00:07:51] Textbooks became vehicles from military propaganda.
[00:07:55] In geography book even used the shape of Japan as justification for expansion.
[00:08:01] We appear to be standing in the vanguard of Asia, advancing bravely into the Pacific.
[00:08:07] At the same time we appear ready to defend the Asian continent from outside attack.
[00:08:14] Teachers also instilled in boys hatred and contempt for the Chinese people, preparing them
[00:08:20] psychologically for a future invasion of the Chinese mainland.
[00:08:26] One historian tells the story of a squamous Japanese schoolboy in the 1930s who burst into
[00:08:31] tears when told the dissected a frog.
[00:08:34] His teacher slammed his knuckles against the boys head and yelled, why are you crying about
[00:08:38] one lousy frog?
[00:08:39] When you grow up you'll have to kill 100-200 chinks.
[00:08:49] Japanese minister of education declared that schools were run not for the benefit of the
[00:08:54] students but for the good of the country.
[00:08:58] Elementary school teachers were trained like military crutes with student teachers housed
[00:09:03] in barracks and subject to harsh discipline and indoctrination.
[00:09:07] In 1890 the imperial rescript on education emerged.
[00:09:12] It laid down a code of ethics to govern not only students and teachers but every Japanese
[00:09:18] citizen.
[00:09:19] The rescript was the civilian equivalent of Japanese military codes which valued above all
[00:09:27] obedience to authority and unconditional loyalty to the emperor.
[00:09:35] In every Japanese school copy of the rescript was enshrined with a portrait of the emperor
[00:09:40] and taken out each morning to be read.
[00:09:43] It was reputed that more than one teacher who accidentally stumbled over the words committed
[00:09:48] suicide to a tone for the insult to the sacred document.
[00:09:54] So we've got a that's 1890 by the way, 1890.
[00:09:58] So this is generations now that this is being plugged into the students' brains.
[00:10:06] And these things, when we talk about students, we talk about children.
[00:10:13] We teach them generally freedom is the ultimate goal, freedom is the ultimate.
[00:10:22] The ultimate thing to strive for.
[00:10:28] The ultimate thing to defend is freedom.
[00:10:32] And here they're getting taught that the ultimate thing was obedience to authority and unconditional
[00:10:38] loyalty.
[00:10:42] Back to the book, it was commonplace for teachers to behave like sadistic drills start
[00:10:46] and slapping children across the cheeks, hitting them with their fists or bludgeoning
[00:10:50] them with bamboo or wooden swords.
[00:10:53] Students were forced to hold heavy objects, sit on their knees, stand barefoot in the snow
[00:10:58] or run around the playground until they collapse from exhaustion.
[00:11:02] There were certainly few visits to the schools by indignant or even concerned parents.
[00:11:08] The pressure to conform to authority intensified if the school boy decided to become a soldier.
[00:11:15] Vicious hazing and relentless pecking order usually squelched any residual spirit of individualism
[00:11:21] within him.
[00:11:23] Obedience was touted as a supreme virtue.
[00:11:28] And a sense of individual self-worth was replaced by a sense of value as a small cog in
[00:11:33] the larger scheme of things.
[00:11:36] We established this sublimation of individuality to the common good, superior officers
[00:11:42] of older soldiers slapped recruits for almost no reason at all or beat them severely with
[00:11:47] heaven and wooden rods.
[00:11:50] According to the author Toshio, officers often justified unauthorized punishment saying,
[00:11:57] I do not beat you because I hate you.
[00:11:59] I beat you because I care for you.
[00:12:01] Do you think I perform these acts with hands swollen and bloody in a state of madness?
[00:12:07] Some youths died under such brutal physical conditions, others committed suicide.
[00:12:13] The majority became tempered vessels into which the military could pour a new set of life
[00:12:19] goals.
[00:12:23] So this is complete, you know, militant raising of children and what I want to note here
[00:12:30] is anybody that thinks, you know what, that probably produced some incredible warriors.
[00:12:34] You're actually wrong.
[00:12:36] Did it reduce warriors?
[00:12:37] Yes, it did.
[00:12:38] But let's remember that these warriors that were raised in this manner, when they had American
[00:12:49] soldiers and marines that had to face them when they were incredibly well dug in defensive
[00:12:56] positions and the Americans had to take beach fronts and beach heads, the free thinking
[00:13:03] American soldier proved to be the better.
[00:13:11] Back to the book, training was no less grueling a process for aspiring officers.
[00:13:17] Above all, the Japanese cadets were to adopt a will which knows no defeat.
[00:13:25] So terrified were the cadets of any hint of failure that examination results were kept secret
[00:13:30] to minimize the risk of suicide.
[00:13:35] So that's what again, this is going all the way back to 1890, so we've got 40, 50 years
[00:13:40] worth before we get into this, where this massacre takes place.
[00:13:48] Back to the book, in the summer of 1937, Japan finally succeeded in provoking a full-scale
[00:13:52] war with China.
[00:13:54] So Japan was now engaging in a war with China.
[00:13:57] They went to Shanghai, the Japanese invaded Shanghai, big giant city, and they thought
[00:14:04] they were going to have no factor, right?
[00:14:06] Because they're getting told all the time that they're the best, and they're the supreme
[00:14:11] warriors and all this.
[00:14:13] Well going back to the book here, Japanese military leaders had boasted and seriously
[00:14:17] believed that Japan could conquer all of mainland China within three months.
[00:14:22] We got some arrogance going on here, but when a battle in a single Chinese city alone that
[00:14:28] was Shanghai dragged from summer to fall and then from fall to winter, it shattered
[00:14:33] Japanese fantasies of an easy victory.
[00:14:36] Here, this primitive people, in literary, in military science and poorly trained, had managed
[00:14:42] to fight the superior Japanese to a standstill.
[00:14:46] And Shanghai finally fell in November the mood of the imperial troops had turned ugly.
[00:14:53] And many say, and many it was said, lusted for revenge as they marched towards Nanking.
[00:15:04] So they're on route now.
[00:15:05] They had a hard time taking down Shanghai.
[00:15:08] They got vengeance on their mind when they're going into the city of Nanking.
[00:15:12] Back to the book.
[00:15:13] Little was spared on the path to Nanking.
[00:15:15] Japanese veterans remember raiding tiny farm communities where they clubbed or bayoneted
[00:15:20] everyone in sight.
[00:15:23] But small villages were not the only casualties.
[00:15:26] Entire cities were raised to the ground.
[00:15:30] Consider the example of Su Chau, a city on the east bank of Tai Hu Lake.
[00:15:37] One of the oldest cities in China, it was prized for its delicate silk embroidery palaces
[00:15:41] and temple temples.
[00:15:44] This canals and ancient bridges had earned its earned the city, its western nickname
[00:15:48] as the Venice of China.
[00:15:51] On November 19th, on a morning of pouring rain, a Japanese advanced guard marched
[00:15:57] to the gates of Su Chau wearing hoods that prevented the Chinese centuries from recognizing
[00:16:02] them.
[00:16:03] Once inside, the Japanese murdered and plundered the city for days, burning down ancient
[00:16:09] landmarks and abducting thousands of Chinese women for sexual slavery.
[00:16:14] The invasion, according to the China Weekly Review, caused a population of the city to
[00:16:19] drop from 350,000 to less than 500.
[00:16:30] But the worst was still to come.
[00:16:32] Now there was a general that was sort of in charge of the Japanese that were heading to
[00:16:40] to Nanking.
[00:16:41] His name was General Matsui.
[00:16:43] He seemed to have some semblance of honor to him and gave some pretty good, I would say,
[00:16:56] benevolent type as benevolent as you can be when you're going into war of orders.
[00:17:01] So here's one of the things that he proclaimed, the back to the book, the entry of the
[00:17:05] Imperial Army into a foreign capital is a great event in our history, attracting the attention
[00:17:09] of the world.
[00:17:11] Therefore let no unit enter the city in a disorderly fashion.
[00:17:15] Let them know beforehand the matters to be remembered in the position of foreign rights
[00:17:19] and interests in the walled city.
[00:17:22] Let them be absolutely free from plunder.
[00:17:27] He's given some pretty, like I said, about his benevolent
[00:17:31] orders as you could give, that was Matsui.
[00:17:34] Well, unfortunately Matsui gets sick and he can't be the leader.
[00:17:41] Although he kind of goes in and out of a leadership position as this is going on, there's
[00:17:44] a new guy that comes in and the new guy that comes in is his actual royalty named Prince
[00:17:50] Asaka.
[00:17:53] Now Prince Asaka gets word.
[00:17:57] He starts to get to understand the situation that they're going into and he gets told that
[00:18:01] they're going to be when they take Nanking, they're going to have about 300,000 Chinese
[00:18:06] troops to deal with.
[00:18:10] And they get some preliminary word that it sounds like the Chinese are ready to surrender.
[00:18:17] They kind of hear that intelligence.
[00:18:18] They have spies in there and whatnot.
[00:18:20] Back to the book, after Asaka heard this report, it was said that his headquarters sent
[00:18:24] out a set of orders under his personal seal marked Secret to be destroyed.
[00:18:31] We now know that the message of these orders was clear.
[00:18:36] Kill all captives.
[00:18:41] And they actually do have a copy of an order that came out.
[00:18:46] And this was on December 13, 1937, the Japanese 66 battalion received the following command.
[00:18:51] I'm not going to read the whole thing, but here's parts of it.
[00:18:55] Battalion battle reporter at zero to zero zero received order from the Regiment Commander
[00:19:01] to comply with orders from the brigade commanding headquarters, all prisoners of war are
[00:19:06] to be executed.
[00:19:07] Method of execution divide the prisoners into group of a dozen, shoot to kill separately.
[00:19:13] Goes on to give some details about who's supposed to run this and then it continues back
[00:19:19] to the book, the vicinity of the imprisonment must be heavily guarded.
[00:19:24] Our intentions are absolutely not to be detected by the prisoners.
[00:19:30] Every company is to complete preparation before zero 500 executions are to start promptly
[00:19:37] by that time and action is to be finished by 730.
[00:19:44] So there you go.
[00:19:45] Straight up orders.
[00:19:46] They're going to kill everyone.
[00:19:49] It's very important to note here.
[00:19:52] These are intentions are absolutely not to be detected.
[00:19:55] So they were going to make it very clandestine and keep the Chinese from knowing that they
[00:20:00] were going to kill them all.
[00:20:03] Back to the book, there was a ruthless logic to the order.
[00:20:06] The captives could not be fed so they had to be destroyed.
[00:20:10] Killing them would not only eliminate the food problem, but diminish the possibility of retaliation.
[00:20:16] Moreover, dead enemies could not form up into guerilla forces.
[00:20:24] So they have their orders.
[00:20:26] They go in and begin the operation.
[00:20:29] Here we go.
[00:20:30] Back to the book.
[00:20:31] All this was easier to achieve than the Japanese had anticipated.
[00:20:36] Resistance was sporadic.
[00:20:37] Indeed, it was practically non-existent.
[00:20:41] Having thrown away their arms when attempting to flee the city as the Japanese closed
[00:20:46] in, many Chinese soldiers simply turned themselves in, hoping for better treatment.
[00:20:52] Once the men surrendered and permitted their hands to be bound, the rest was easy.
[00:21:03] So the Chinese give up their weapons and allow themselves to be taken.
[00:21:11] Not a good idea.
[00:21:14] Now we're going to go to a quote from a Japanese soldier named Azuma.
[00:21:24] It was funny yet pitiful when I imagined how they gathered whatever white cloth they could
[00:21:31] find attached it to a dead twig and marched forward just to surrender.
[00:21:37] I thought how could they become prisoners with the kind of force that they had more than
[00:21:42] two battalions and even without trying to show any resistance.
[00:21:47] There must have been a considerable number of officers for this many troops but not a single
[00:21:51] one remained.
[00:21:53] All of them having slipped away and escaped, I thought.
[00:21:57] Although we had two companies and those 7,000 prisoners had already been disarmed, our troops
[00:22:02] could have been annihilated, had they decided to rise up and revolt.
[00:22:07] I didn't go through too much of this but it was a chaotic scene when the Chinese realized
[00:22:17] what was going to happen and as that indicated a lot of the senior leadership, they fled
[00:22:21] the city and left the soldiers there.
[00:22:23] Now with no leadership and what are they going to do?
[00:22:26] The Japanese did psychological warfare on them and dropped leaflets that said, hey if you surrender
[00:22:32] you'll be treated well, we have rice for you and that's what they did.
[00:22:35] They lied, of course.
[00:22:42] Back to the book, when the Japanese military received orders on December 17 to kill prisoners
[00:22:47] they proceeded with extra caution.
[00:22:49] That morning the Japanese announced that they were going to transport the Chinese prisoners
[00:22:53] to a small island in the middle of the Yanzi River.
[00:22:56] They explained to the captives that they needed to take special precautions to move for
[00:23:01] the move and bound the captives hands behind their backs.
[00:23:04] The tasks that took all morning and most of the afternoon.
[00:23:09] Sometime between 4 and 6 p.m., the Japanese divided the prisoners into 4 columns and marched
[00:23:16] them to the west, skirting the hills and stopping at the riverbank.
[00:23:21] After three or four hours of waiting and not knowing what was going on the prisoners could
[00:23:25] not see any preparations for crossing the river.
[00:23:30] For corporal route, it was going dark. They did not know that Japanese soldiers already
[00:23:37] encircled them in a crescent formation along the river and that they were in sites of
[00:23:41] many machine guns.
[00:23:44] By the time the executions began it was too late for the Chinese to escape.
[00:23:51] Suddenly all kinds of guns fired at once.
[00:23:56] Parihah, Richi wrote, the sound of the firearms mingled with the desperate yelling and
[00:24:02] screams.
[00:24:04] For an hour the Chinese struggled and thrashed about desperately until there were few sounds
[00:24:10] coming from the group.
[00:24:13] From evening until dawn the Japanese bayoneted the bodies one by one.
[00:24:24] And that seemed to place over and over again because what they did is they indicated
[00:24:30] and then in that order if you missed it they separated the group.
[00:24:34] So they had them captured inside the city and then they took them in small units of 30, 40
[00:24:40] Chinese soldiers tied their hands and said, we're going to transport you and they did this
[00:24:44] all over the city at the same time coordinated and then took them out to different places
[00:24:48] outside the city and killed them.
[00:24:53] But it wasn't only the soldiers that they did this to.
[00:24:57] Back to the book after the soldiers surrendered on mass there was virtually no one left
[00:25:02] to protect the citizens of the city.
[00:25:05] Knowing this the Japanese poured into Nanking on December 13th, 1937, occupying government
[00:25:11] buildings, banks and warehouses shooting people randomly in the streets many of them
[00:25:15] in the back as they ran away.
[00:25:18] Using machine guns, revolvers and rifles the Japanese fired at the crowds of wounded
[00:25:23] soldiers elderly women and children who gathered in the north and central roads and nearby
[00:25:30] alleys.
[00:25:31] They also killed Chinese civilians in every section of the city.
[00:25:35] Tiny lanes, major boulevard, mud dugouts, government buildings, city squares.
[00:25:42] As victims toppled to the ground, moaning and screaming the streets alleys and ditches
[00:25:48] of the fallen capital, ran rivers of blood, much of it coming from people barely alive
[00:25:53] with no strength left to run away.
[00:25:59] The Japanese systematically killed the city dwellers as they conducted house to house
[00:26:03] searches for Chinese soldiers in Nanking.
[00:26:08] But they also massacred the Chinese and nearby suburbs and countryside.
[00:26:12] Corpse is piled up outside the city walls along the river by ponds and lakes and on
[00:26:17] hills and mountains.
[00:26:21] In villages near Nanking the Japanese shot down any young man who passed under the presumption
[00:26:25] that he was likely to be a former Chinese soldier.
[00:26:30] But they also murdered people who could not possibly be Chinese soldiers elderly men
[00:26:34] and women for instance, if they hesitated or even if they failed to understand orders,
[00:26:40] which would deliver the Japanese language.
[00:26:43] Obviously, not every Chinese person spoke Japanese.
[00:26:49] So this is now just a full-on killing spree.
[00:26:55] And I'm going to read a section here.
[00:26:57] There was military war correspondence.
[00:27:01] That were there from the Japanese military.
[00:27:05] And I will read this one is from a military war correspondent named Yukiyo Omata.
[00:27:13] And he saw the Chinese prisoners being brought and lined up along the river.
[00:27:21] Back to the book, those in the first row were beheaded.
[00:27:28] Those in the second row were forced to dump the severed bodies into the river before they
[00:27:32] themselves were beheaded.
[00:27:35] The killing went on nonstop for mourning until night, but they were only able to kill
[00:27:40] 2,000 persons in this way.
[00:27:43] The next day tired of killing in this fashion, they set up machine guns.
[00:27:48] Through them raked across fire at the lined-up prisoners, rat-tatt-tatt.
[00:27:54] Triggers were pulled.
[00:27:55] The prisoners fled into the water, but no one was able to make it to the other shore.
[00:28:07] This systematic murder of everyone is basically what we're dealing with.
[00:28:18] And when they got their momentum going on the extermination of most of the men, they turned
[00:28:28] their attention to the women.
[00:28:32] To the book, women suffered the most.
[00:28:37] Taka-Koro-Kozu, a former soldier in the 114th Division of the Japanese Army in Nanking,
[00:28:44] recalled.
[00:28:46] No matter how young or old they all could not escape the fate of being raped.
[00:28:54] We sent out cold trucks to the city streets and villages to seize a lot of women.
[00:29:01] And then each of them was allocated to 15 to 20 soldiers for sexual intercourse and abuse.
[00:29:12] Surviving Japanese veterans claim that the army had officially outlawed rape of enemy
[00:29:20] women.
[00:29:21] But rape remained so deeply embedded in Japanese military culture and superstition that no one
[00:29:26] took the rule seriously.
[00:29:29] They believed that raping virgins would make them more powerful in battle.
[00:29:35] Soldiers were even known to wear amulets, made from the pubic hair of such victims, believing
[00:29:41] that they possessed magical powers against injury.
[00:29:46] The military policy forbidding rape only encouraged soldiers to kill their victims afterwards.
[00:29:55] Having an interview for the documentary in the name of the emperor, as you must shiro,
[00:30:01] a former Japanese soldier spoke candidly about the process of rape and murder in Nanking.
[00:30:09] We took turns raping them.
[00:30:11] It would be alright if we only rape them.
[00:30:14] I shouldn't say alright, but we always stabbed and killed them because dead bodies don't
[00:30:20] talk.
[00:30:25] Back a coro-koso shared asumas bluntness and discussing the issue.
[00:30:30] After raping, we would also kill them.
[00:30:33] He recalled, these women would start to flee once we let them go.
[00:30:39] Then we would bang, shoot them in the back and finish them up.
[00:30:46] According to surviving veterans, many of the soldiers felt remarkably little guilt about
[00:30:50] this.
[00:30:53] Perhaps when we were raping her, we looked at her as a woman, a zoomerote.
[00:30:57] But when we killed her, we just thought of her as something like a pig.
[00:31:20] So where is this mindset comes from that permits this kind of behavior?
[00:31:30] I'm going to the book.
[00:31:32] The Japanese soldier was not simply hardened for battle in China.
[00:31:38] He was hardened for the task of murdering Chinese combatants and non-combatants alike.
[00:31:43] Indeed, various games and exercises were set up by the Japanese military to nomads men to
[00:31:51] the human instinct against killing people who are not attacking.
[00:31:56] For example, on the way to the capital, Japanese soldiers were made to participate in killing
[00:32:02] competitions, which were avidly covered by the Japanese media like sporting events.
[00:32:09] The most notorious one appeared in the December 7th issue of the Japan advisor under the
[00:32:15] headline, sub-lutenants race to fell 100 Chinese running close contest.
[00:32:24] Sub-lutenant Mukaay Toshiyaki and sub-lutenant Noda Takishi.
[00:32:32] They were in a contest, friendly contest to see which one of them will first fell 100 Chinese
[00:32:40] individuals' individual's sword combat.
[00:32:45] Before the Japanese forces completely occupied Nanking, they're well in the final phase
[00:32:52] of their race running almost neck to neck.
[00:32:56] On Sunday, December 5th, the score, according to Asahi, was sub-lutenant Mukaay 89 and
[00:33:05] sub-lutenant Noda 78.
[00:33:13] Just to give some more context on this, these were just lining people up and chopping their
[00:33:21] heads off.
[00:33:22] That's what this was.
[00:33:23] This is lining up civilians and let's see who can get to 150 or 100 first.
[00:33:32] Back to the book a week later, the paper reported that neither man could decide who had
[00:33:36] passed the 100 mark first, so they up the goal to 150.
[00:33:43] Mukaay's blade was slightly damaged in the competition that Japan advisor reported.
[00:33:48] He explained that this was the result of cutting a Chinese in half, helmet and all.
[00:33:55] The contest was fun.
[00:33:58] He declared.
[00:34:06] Another Japanese soldier talking about his experience, Tommy Nagashozo wrote, we made them
[00:34:16] like this.
[00:34:18] Good sons, good daddies, good elder brothers at home were brought to the front to kill
[00:34:22] each other.
[00:34:25] Human beings turned into murdering demons.
[00:34:28] Everyone became a demon within three months.
[00:34:34] In interview, after interview, Japanese veterans from the Nanking Massacre reported honestly
[00:34:42] that they experienced a complete lack of remorse or sense of wrongdoing even when torturing
[00:34:47] helpless civilians.
[00:34:50] Nagatomi Hakuto spoke candidly about his emotions in the fallen capital.
[00:34:55] I remember being driven in a truck along a path that had been cleared through piles of
[00:35:01] thousands and thousands of slaughtered bodies.
[00:35:05] Wild dogs were gnawing at the dead flesh as we stopped and pulled a group of Chinese
[00:35:10] prisoners out of the back.
[00:35:13] Then the Japanese officer proposed a test of my courage.
[00:35:17] He unsheathed his sword, spat on it, and with a sudden mighty swing he brought it down on
[00:35:22] the neck of a Chinese boy cowering before us.
[00:35:26] The head was cut clean off and tumbled away on the group as the body slumped forward.
[00:35:33] Blood spurting out into great gushing fountains from the neck.
[00:35:39] The officer suggested I take the head home as a souvenir.
[00:35:46] I remember smiling proudly as I took his sword and began killing people.
[00:35:53] Few know that soldiers in pailed babies on bayonets and tossed them still alive into pots of
[00:35:59] boiling water.
[00:36:02] The gang raped women from ages of 12 to 80 and then killed them when they could no longer
[00:36:09] satisfy sexual requirements.
[00:36:12] I beheaded people, starve them to death, burn them and bury them alive over 200 in
[00:36:19] all.
[00:36:21] It is terrible that I could turn into an animal and do these things.
[00:36:26] There are really no words to explain what I was doing.
[00:36:33] I was truly a devil.
[00:36:52] And on those situations torture was also completely common.
[00:37:05] And here's what the book says.
[00:37:06] The torture that the Japanese inflicted upon the native population at Nanking almost suppresses
[00:37:11] suppresses the limits of human comprehension here are only a few examples.
[00:37:19] Five burials, the Japanese directed burial operations with the precision and efficiency
[00:37:24] of an assembly line.
[00:37:26] Soldiers would force one group of Chinese captives to dig a grave, a second group to bury
[00:37:30] the first and then a third group to bury the second and so on.
[00:37:35] Some victims were partially buried to their chest or necks so that they would endure
[00:37:39] further agony such as being hacked to pieces by swords or run over by horses and tanks.
[00:37:48] The Japanese not only disemboweled, decapatated and dismembered victims but performed
[00:37:54] more excruciating varieties of torture.
[00:37:58] Throughout the city they nailed prisoners to wooden boards and ran over them with tanks,
[00:38:02] crucified them to trees and electrical posts, carved long strips of flesh from them and
[00:38:07] used them for bayonet practice.
[00:38:10] At least 100 men reportedly had their eyes gouged out and their noses and ears hacked
[00:38:15] off before being set on fire.
[00:38:22] Another group of 200 Chinese soldiers and civilians were stripped naked tied to columns
[00:38:27] and doors of a school and then stabbed by special needles with handles on them in hundreds
[00:38:32] of points along their bodies including their mouths, throats and eyes.
[00:38:42] Death by fire.
[00:38:44] The Japanese subjected large crowds of victims to mass incineration.
[00:38:51] A Japanese soldier bound Chinese captives together ten at a time and pushed them into a
[00:38:55] pit where they were sprayed with gasoline and ignited.
[00:39:01] On taping road, the Japanese ordered a large number of shop clerks to extinguish a fire
[00:39:06] then bound them together with rope and threw them into the blaze.
[00:39:11] Japanese soldiers even devised games with fire.
[00:39:16] One method of entertainment was to drive mobs of Chinese to the top stories or roofs
[00:39:20] of buildings tear down the stairs and then set the bottom floors on fire.
[00:39:27] Many such victims committed suicide by jumping out of windows or off-roop tops.
[00:39:33] Another form of amusement involved dousing victims in fuel, shooting them and watching
[00:39:38] them explode into flame.
[00:39:42] In one infamous incident, Japanese soldiers forced hundreds of men, women and children into
[00:39:47] a square soaked them with gasoline and then fired on them with machine guns.
[00:39:55] Death by ice.
[00:39:56] Thousands of victims were intentionally frozen to death during the rape of Nanking.
[00:40:01] For instance, Japanese soldiers forced hundreds of Chinese prisoners to march the edge of
[00:40:06] a frozen pond where they were ordered to strip naked, break the ice and plunge in the
[00:40:10] water to go fishing.
[00:40:13] Their bodies hardened into floating targets that were immediately riddled with Japanese bullets.
[00:40:19] In another incident, the Japanese tied up a group of refugees flung them into a shallow
[00:40:24] pond and bombarding them with hang grenades causing an explosive shower of blood and flesh.
[00:40:34] By dogs, one diabolical means of torture was to bury victims to their waste and watch
[00:40:40] them get ripped apart by German shepherds.
[00:40:44] Witnesses saw Japanese soldiers strip a victim naked and direct German shepherds to bite
[00:40:50] sensitive areas of his body.
[00:40:54] The dogs not only ripped open his belly but jerked out his intestines along the ground
[00:40:59] for a distance.
[00:41:03] The incidents mentioned above are only a fraction of the methods that the Japanese use to
[00:41:07] torment their victims.
[00:41:11] The Japanese saturated victims in acid and pale babies with bayonets hung people by their tongues.
[00:41:19] One Japanese reporter who later investigated the rape of Nanking learned that at least
[00:41:23] one Japanese soldier tore the heart and liver out of a Chinese victim to eat them.
[00:41:30] In genitals apparently were consumed, a Chinese soldier who escaped from Japanese custody
[00:41:36] saw several dead people in the streets with their penises cut off.
[00:41:41] He was later told that the penises were sold to Japanese customers who believed that eating
[00:41:46] them would increase fertility.
[00:42:05] With regards to the fate of the women, they don't know how to determine the exact number
[00:42:16] of the women that were raped in Nanking.
[00:42:23] But they do know that it was almost a universal.
[00:42:30] Back to the book, the Japanese raped Nanking Women from all classes.
[00:42:35] Farmwives, students, teachers, white collar and blue collar workers, wives of YMCA employees,
[00:42:41] university professors, even Buddhist nuns, some of whom were gang-raped to death.
[00:42:50] And they were systematic in their recruitment of women.
[00:42:52] And Nanking, Japanese soldiers searched for them constantly as they looted homes and dragged
[00:42:57] men off-wrecks execution.
[00:43:01] Some actually conducted door-to-door searches demanding money and young girls.
[00:43:09] Chinese women were raped in all locations and at all hours.
[00:43:16] An estimated one-third of all rapes occurred during the day.
[00:43:20] Survivors even remember soldiers prying open in the legs of victims to rape them and broad
[00:43:25] daylight in the middle of the street and in front of crowds of witnesses.
[00:43:30] No place was too sacred for rape.
[00:43:33] The Japanese attacked women in nunneries, churches, and Bible training schools.
[00:43:40] 17 soldiers raped one woman in succession in a seminary compound.
[00:43:48] Old age was no concern to the Japanese.
[00:43:51] Matrix, grandmothers and great-grandmothers and dirt-repeded sexual assaults.
[00:43:59] So Japanese soldiers who raped a woman of 60 was ordered to clean the penis by her mouth.
[00:44:05] When a woman of 62 protested the soldiers that was she was too old for sex, they rammed
[00:44:09] a stick up and stied her instead.
[00:44:15] Many women in their 80s were raped to death and at least one woman in that age group was
[00:44:21] shot and killed because she refused to Japanese soldiers' advances.
[00:44:36] If the Japanese treatment of old women was terrible, their treatment of young children was
[00:44:41] unthinkable.
[00:44:45] Little girls were raped so brutally that some could not walk for weeks afterwards.
[00:44:51] Many required surgery others died.
[00:44:56] Chinese witnesses saw Japanese rape girls under 10 years of age in the streets and then
[00:45:01] slashed them in half by sword.
[00:45:06] In some cases the Japanese sliced open the vaginas of pre-teen girls in order to ravish
[00:45:11] them more effectively.
[00:45:28] Even in advanced stages of pregnancy did not render women immune to assault.
[00:45:35] The Japanese violated many who were about to go into labor were in labor or who had given
[00:45:41] birth only a few days earlier.
[00:45:44] One victim who his nine months pregnant was raped suffered not only still birth but a complete
[00:45:49] mental collapse.
[00:45:52] At least one pregnant woman was kicked to death.
[00:45:55] Still more gruesome was the treatment a lot of the some of the unborn children of these
[00:45:59] women.
[00:46:02] After gang rape, Japanese soldiers sometimes slashed open the bellies of pregnant women ripped
[00:46:07] out the fetuses for amusement.
[00:46:35] During the mass rape the Japanese destroyed children and infants often because they were
[00:46:39] in the way.
[00:46:41] I witnessed his report.
[00:46:44] Described children and babies suffocating from clothes stuffed in their mouths or bayonet
[00:46:49] into death because they whept as their mothers were being raped.
[00:46:53] American and European observers of the rape of Nanking recorded numerous entries like this
[00:46:58] one.
[00:47:02] February 3rd about 5 p.m. at Chang Su's saying three soldiers came and forced a woman
[00:47:09] to throw away her baby after raping her.
[00:47:12] They went away laughing.
[00:47:34] Perhaps one of the most brutal forms of Japanese entertainment was the impalement of vaginas.
[00:47:40] In the streets of Nanking corpses of women lay with their legs, split open, their orifice
[00:47:46] pierced by wooden rods, twigs and weeds.
[00:47:50] It is painful, almost mind-numbing to contemplate some of the other objects that were used
[00:47:55] to torment the Nanking women who suffered almost unendurable or deals.
[00:48:03] For instance one Japanese soldier who raped a young woman for us to beer bottle into her
[00:48:07] and shatter.
[00:48:10] The rape victim was found with a golf stick rammed into her.
[00:48:15] On December 22nd, in a neighborhood near the gate of Tonging Men, the Japanese raped a
[00:48:22] barber's wife and then stuck a firecracker in her vagina.
[00:48:26] It blew up and killed her.
[00:48:35] Not all the victims were women.
[00:48:39] Japanese men were often sawdomized or forced to perform a variety of repulsive sexual acts
[00:48:44] in front of laughing Chinese soldiers or Japanese soldiers.
[00:48:49] At least one Chinese man was murdered because he refused to commit necrophilia with the
[00:48:53] corpse of a woman in the snow.
[00:48:58] The Japanese also delighted in trying to cause men who had taken lifetime vows of celibacy
[00:49:03] to engage in sexual intercourse.
[00:49:07] The Chinese woman had tried to disguise herself as a man trying to pass through the gates
[00:49:11] of Nanking but Japanese guards who systematically searched all passing pedestrians by
[00:49:15] groping at their crutches, discovered her true sex.
[00:49:20] Gang raped followed at which time a Buddhist monk had the misfortune to venture near the
[00:49:26] scene.
[00:49:27] The Japanese tried to force him to have sex to the woman they had just raped.
[00:49:32] In the monk protested, they castrated him, causing the poor man to bleed to death.
[00:49:41] Some of the most sorted instances of sexual torture involved the degradation of entire families.
[00:49:48] The Japanese drew sadistic pleasure in forcing Chinese men to commit incest, fathers
[00:49:53] to rape their own daughters, brothers, their sisters, sons, their mothers.
[00:49:59] A Chinese battalion commander stranded in Nanking for three months after the city fell,
[00:50:04] saw her heard of at least four or five instances in which the Japanese ordered sons to
[00:50:08] rape their mothers.
[00:50:12] Those who refused were killed on the spot.
[00:50:16] As reported, substantiated by the testimony of a German diplomat who reported that one
[00:50:21] Chinese man who refused to rape his own mother was killed with saber strokes and that
[00:50:25] his mother committed suicide shortly thereafter.
[00:50:47] Those who defied the Japanese were often found later with their eyes torn out their
[00:50:50] noses, ears, and breasts cut off.
[00:51:12] As I said, this is purieval.
[00:51:26] And I don't know what else to say.
[00:51:46] Now I'm going to the book here.
[00:51:50] It's hard to talk about a bright spot in the horror that is the rape of Nanking, but if one
[00:51:55] can, it is surely to shine a light on the actions of a small band of Americans and Europeans
[00:52:00] who risked their lives to defy the Japanese invaders and rescue hundreds of thousands of
[00:52:06] Chinese refugees from almost certain extermination.
[00:52:11] The courageous men and women created the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone.
[00:52:15] So this is amongst obviously this just most sadistic and heinous evil.
[00:52:25] There were some Americans and some Europeans that lived and worked in Nanking.
[00:52:32] You got to remember this is 1937, so it wasn't a world war yet.
[00:52:36] There was Germans, there in Nanking, there was Americans, there in Nanking.
[00:52:41] So when this started to happen, there was several of them who basically formed an area,
[00:52:48] which I did, you know, this is a safe zone.
[00:52:52] And one of them interestingly was a German and it was a Nazi.
[00:53:00] So there's a Nazi who they ended up calling the living Buddha of Nanking.
[00:53:06] And so this individual John Rae was, he risked his life to set up the safety zone and
[00:53:18] actually, you know, he was like I said, he was a Nazi, but he had spent so much time
[00:53:26] in Nanking that he had all these Chinese friends and you know, according to the background
[00:53:31] on him, you know, he's there in 19, he's been there for many years and I don't know what
[00:53:37] you got there, but he's not familiar with what's going on with the actual Nazi party
[00:53:40] back in Germany.
[00:53:41] He's disconnected.
[00:53:42] I mean, there's, you know, this is whatever, there's no internet.
[00:53:45] He's not watching TV, he doesn't know what's going on.
[00:53:47] So he was just sort of sort of there and oh, the prominent party in Germany is the Nazi
[00:53:51] party.
[00:53:52] Oh, and I'm a diplomat, so I guess I'm a Nazi.
[00:53:56] And, but when he, you know, he sounded like he was a guy that was a benevolent guy.
[00:54:01] He actually went out into town and literally stopped rapes from happening himself.
[00:54:06] And what's interesting is, and this, this, to me, set up that, you could see what they
[00:54:11] thought of the Chinese people is that all he would do is go out and speak stop.
[00:54:15] And he, he had the Nazi armband or what he had Nazi either, the swastika.
[00:54:20] And when they saw that, they would listen to him.
[00:54:22] And so I mean, he's so like he was a white guy and they, they clearly listened to him
[00:54:27] and were kind of afraid of him. And yet, you know, obviously they had zero, less than zero,
[00:54:35] respect for the Chinese people. And so, so he actually wrote a letter as well to Hitler,
[00:54:44] explaining what was going on. And, you know, there's no one knows if Hitler actually ever
[00:54:50] read it. It sounds like he read it and ignored it. But one of the most interesting and
[00:54:55] important pieces of what John Rae did is he, he kept the journal, a detailed journal of what
[00:55:02] had happened. So a lot of the stuff that I just quoted, which I know is, is horrible. He was
[00:55:08] the guy. He's one of the people that wrote it down and made sure that that was going to
[00:55:14] be recorded. And actually the, the, that diary didn't get really discovered and uncovered
[00:55:24] until much later, until really, and, and, and Iris Chang is the one that sort of popularized
[00:55:30] and took this journal and made it into a real document that explained what had happened there.
[00:55:37] So that's, you know, again, this, this John Rae, you know, let's, let's, let's even in all
[00:55:44] that darkness. There was people that stepped up and spoke against it. Another one was a guy named
[00:55:50] by the name of Robert Wilson and he was actually grew up in Nan King and he was a Methodist missionary.
[00:56:01] But he had then left Nan King and gone back to America. He went to Princeton and then he went
[00:56:05] to Harvard Medical School and when he got done with all of his schooling. Instead of staying in
[00:56:10] America, he went back to Nan King to become a surgeon in Nan King and he was him along with John Rae,
[00:56:17] these were the guys that went out and set up this protective zone and did all kinds of, you know,
[00:56:23] it's sort of like a Schindler's list scenario. They were helping soldiers get rid of their papers
[00:56:28] and given clothes. They didn't look like Chinese soldiers. It's sheltering women, bringing, setting up
[00:56:35] places where the women could hide in the addicts of the buildings. That's what they were doing.
[00:56:39] And it's the only thing that's, well, I guess not different, but, you know,
[00:56:42] it's different in the fact that they could get away with it because we weren't at war with the Japanese.
[00:56:50] And so this guy Wilson was a surgeon. So not only was he trying to protect people,
[00:56:55] he was doing surgery on them all the time trying to get them to, trying to save them from these
[00:56:59] devastating wounds that they had. He also kept a really detailed diary, which again, these,
[00:57:10] and this is, you know, part of a whole kind of genesis of this book is that, and I'll get to this later,
[00:57:19] but, you know, you've heard of like Holocaust deniers of the Holocaust and happened to well,
[00:57:26] it's the same thing with this event. People say, oh, and it wasn't that bad. You know,
[00:57:29] wasn't that big of a deal that we know, there was some killing. So there was people that said that,
[00:57:33] you know, some Japanese nationalists had said, oh, that didn't really wasn't really that bad. It was
[00:57:37] provoked or whatever they're going to say. And these documents, these, these documents that
[00:57:42] corroborated all this information were truly important. Going back to the book here, one of the
[00:57:49] worst scenes, Nilsen's song, Nett Wilson saw Nann King, a scene he would remember for the rest of his life,
[00:57:54] a massive gang of, a massive gang rape of teenage girls in the street, a group of young women
[00:58:01] between the ages of 15 and 18 were lined up by Japanese and then raped in the dirt one after the
[00:58:07] other by an entire regiment. Some hebronched and died while others killed themselves shortly afterwards.
[00:58:16] But the scenes in the hospitals were even more horrifying than those in the streets. Wilson was
[00:58:22] mortified by the women who came to the emergency room with their bellies ripped open by the
[00:58:27] charred and horribly disfingered men, whom the Japanese tried to burn alive and by numerous other
[00:58:33] horrors he had barely had time to describe on paper. He told his wife that he would never
[00:58:40] forget a woman whose head was nearly cut off teetering from a point on her neck. The morning
[00:58:47] came this morning, this is quote, this morning another woman came in a sad plate and with a terrible
[00:58:54] story, a hospital volunteer wrote of this woman in his diary in January 3rd, 1938. She was one of
[00:59:02] the five women whom the Japanese soldier had taken to one of their medical units to wash their clothes
[00:59:07] to buy day and be raped by night. Two of them were forced, the two of them were forced to
[00:59:13] satisfy from 15 to 20 men and the prettiest one as much as 40 each night.
[00:59:18] This one who came to us had been called off by three soldiers into an isolated place where they
[00:59:26] attempted to cut off her head. The muscles of the neck had been cut but they failed this
[00:59:31] sever the spinal cord. She fained death but dragged herself to the hospital another
[00:59:38] of the many to bear witness to the brutality of the soldiers.
[00:59:41] So Wilson just saw complete horrors then back to the book he operated for free because
[00:59:53] few patients had money to pay him but the surgeries exacted a terrible price on his own health.
[00:59:59] In the end his family believes that the only his faith as a devout Methodist combined with
[01:00:04] his love for China gave him the courage to survive the rape of Nanking. Another one of these
[01:00:15] Europeans in this case, American, Westerner, I should say, was Ville Helmina Votron or many
[01:00:24] Votron as they called her as biocupation, head of the education department, Dean of studies at
[01:00:33] Ginnling Women's Arts and Science College was one of the few Western women in the city during the
[01:00:40] first few weeks of the Nanking massacre. Years later she would be remembered not only for her
[01:00:46] courage in protecting thousands of women from Japanese soldier but also for the diary she kept.
[01:00:51] A diary that some historians believe will eventually be recognized much like the diary of Anne Frank
[01:00:56] for its importance in illuminating the spirit of a single witness during the Holocaust of war.
[01:01:04] Votron, the daughter of a blacksmith was 51 years old in 1937 raised in the tiny farming community
[01:01:11] of Sector, Illinois. She went to live with neighbors when her mother died. Despite the
[01:01:17] impoverishment of her childhood, she was able to work her way through school, graduating with
[01:01:22] honors in 1912 from the University of Illinois at Urbana, Champagne.
[01:01:32] So, just again, a Westerner in this case in American, and she had the opportunity to
[01:01:39] maybe escape but she stayed in Nanking. Back to the book with most of the faculty gone from
[01:01:45] Nanking, most of the abandoned their homes to flee to cities like Shanghai, Shenku, and Sichuan.
[01:01:52] Votron was now the acting head of the institution. She labored to prepare for the campus for female
[01:01:58] refugees and to evacuate wounded soldiers from the area. To disguise their identity, she burned
[01:02:03] their military papers and garments in the college and senator. Under her direction furniture
[01:02:07] was moved into addicts, safes were emptied, dorms were cleaned. And valuables were wrapped
[01:02:13] in oil paper and hidden. Meanwhile, posters, signs and arm bands for the Nanking Safety Zone
[01:02:21] were created and distributed among the volunteers.
[01:02:32] Here's talking about a specific day. The following day, December 17, 1937 was even worse.
[01:02:37] The migration of women into gingling only intensified as the Japanese soldiers flooded the city.
[01:02:43] What a heartbreaking sight, Votron wrote. Weary women frightened girls trudging with children and
[01:02:49] bedding and small packages of clothes. They found someone had time to write the story of each
[01:02:54] refugee who came in, she thought, especially the stories of the girls who had blackened their faces
[01:03:00] and cut their hair. As she accommodated the stream of wild, eyed women, she heard stories of
[01:03:06] Japanese raping girls as young as 12, and women as elderly as 60, or raping pregnant women
[01:03:12] had been at point. And the sick and depraved and disgusting and horrific stories go on and on
[01:03:40] and on and the brutality page after page after page of diary entries and quotes and witness accounts.
[01:03:53] And then pictures. There is pictures in the book. The pictures of severed heads and
[01:04:01] Chinese bound to polls being bayoneted to death and pictures of others being beheaded and
[01:04:07] pictures of giant pits filled with bodies and images of hundreds and hundreds of bodies and
[01:04:12] entangled masses on the banks of the gangs you river. It's too much for the mind to comprehend.
[01:04:28] It really is. It's almost too much to understand. And so what we do is we package it all up.
[01:04:39] Right. And we give it a name, a massacre or an atrocity.
[01:04:46] And I'm sure you could tell. I mean even as I'm sitting here reading this, I'm gone. I'm just numb.
[01:05:01] But we have to remember that every one of those people
[01:05:07] tortured, raped and killed was a person. A person like your brother or like your sister or
[01:05:22] like your mom or like your dad or a person like your son or your daughter. A person like you.
[01:05:40] And maybe you can get a hold of that. But what's in some ways even harder grasp is the Japanese soldiers.
[01:05:58] And they were people. And yes, they were certainly monsters,
[01:06:12] vile and despicable and completely devoid of feelings. But even so even though they were monsters,
[01:06:22] they were human monsters. And they too had mothers and fathers and sons and daughters. And yet they did this.
[01:06:38] And the fact that what happened at Nanking was so brutal and so beyond comparison with anything that
[01:06:56] ever happened was one of the things that almost caused it to be forgotten. And that that
[01:07:10] supreme level of brutality lasted about six weeks. And eventually that morphed into an
[01:07:19] occupation of Nanking by the Japanese. And they ruled with an iron fist, of course. And they stole
[01:07:26] and they plunged and they abused locals and they continued to rape. It's they actually institutionalized
[01:07:35] and eventually became even to term comfort women. And they gave out
[01:07:43] so, opium freely to and save people. Just like happens in this day and age, people become slaves to drugs.
[01:07:56] And it stayed in that occupied state for about eight years until
[01:08:04] finally almost as quickly as it began. He ended. I'm going back to the book.
[01:08:17] The end of Nanking's ordeal came in the last, came at last in the summer of 1945.
[01:08:23] On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an untested uranium bomb on Hiroshima,
[01:08:33] Japan's eighth largest city killing 100,000 of its 245 people, 245,000 people on the first day.
[01:08:43] When a Japanese surrender was not forthcoming, the Americans dropped on August 9, a second
[01:08:49] plutonium type bomb on the Japanese city of Nagasaki.
[01:08:55] Less than a week later, on August 14, the Japanese made the final decision to surrender.
[01:09:04] The Japanese remained in the former capital of China until the day of the surrender,
[01:09:08] then quickly left the city. I witnessed his reported that Japanese soldiers could be seen drinking
[01:09:14] heavily or weeping in the streets, some heard rumors of unarmed Japanese men being forced to
[01:09:19] kneel by the side of the road to be beaten by local residents. Retaliation against the Japanese
[01:09:25] garrison appears to be to have been limited, however, because many residents hid at home during
[01:09:31] this chaotic time too fearful to even celebrate the news of a Japanese defeat.
[01:09:35] The evacuation was swift and there was no mass persecution or imprisonment of Japanese soldiers.
[01:09:46] One Nanking resident recalls that she stayed in her house for weeks after the Japanese surrendered
[01:09:51] and when she reemerged, they were gone.
[01:09:54] It was over. There were some level of war crime trials and there were some executions.
[01:10:14] Mainly of the highest profile officers, Prince Asaka, who had given that order to kill all
[01:10:20] captives, he avoided prosecution. The scale of the massacre was downplayed. There was a bunch
[01:10:29] of reasons of why the scale of the rape of Nanking got downplayed. One of them being at the
[01:10:37] now Chinese Communist State was actually trying to build relationships with the post-war Japan.
[01:10:43] The massacre was quietly buried and now you had the Chinese people were now in a communist state.
[01:10:51] There wasn't much speaking out to do. The Japanese downplayed the horrors as saying it was just another
[01:11:03] incident of war. Some Japanese officials were quoted as saying it's a story made up by the
[01:11:08] Chinese. It's the image of Japan but it was a lie. They said things like, I think the Nanking
[01:11:16] Maskers are lie. The women that were raped were labeled as comfort women and licensed prostitutes
[01:11:26] and many Japanese officials say that what happened in Nanking was just a part of war.
[01:11:31] There's a really clear example of downplaying not only the rape of Nanking but of the war in
[01:11:40] general and they put this some of this in the book. They're talking about the Japanese
[01:11:50] education system. Here we go. Back to the book, the Japanese, the entire Japanese education
[01:11:56] system suffers from selective amnesia. For not until 1994, where Japanese schoolchildren taught
[01:12:03] that here, Hito's army was responsible for the death of at least 20 million allied soldiers in
[01:12:08] Asian civilians during World War II. In the early 1990s and newspaper article quoted a Japanese
[01:12:17] high school teacher who claimed that his students were surprised to learn that Japan had been at
[01:12:21] war with the United States. The first thing they wanted to know was who had won. In 1997,
[01:12:30] a 1977 the Ministry of Education reduced a section on World War II within a standard history book
[01:12:36] of several hundred pages to only six pages, which consisted mainly of pictures of American fire
[01:12:43] bombing of Tokyo, a picture of the ruins of Hiroshima and a tally of Japan's war dead.
[01:12:49] The text neglected to mention the casualties on the other side. Japanese war atrocities or the
[01:12:56] forced evacuations of Chinese and Korean prisoners to labor camps in Japan.
[01:13:03] Much of the censorship might have gone on challenge had it not been for the efforts of one brave
[01:13:07] crusader. In 1965, the Japanese historian, Anega Saburo sued the Japanese government.
[01:13:16] This lawsuit was the beginning of a legal battle that would span three decades in gain the
[01:13:22] backing of thousands of sympathetic Japanese followers.
[01:13:28] The Ministry interfered with Anega's attempts to document the Nanking massacre for school children.
[01:13:33] For example, in his textbook manuscript, Anega wrote,
[01:13:38] he wrote this quote, immediately after the occupation of Nanking, the Japanese army killed
[01:13:42] numerous Chinese soldiers and citizens. This incident became known as the Nan King massacre.
[01:13:50] When his book got checked by the examiner, the examiner commented, quote,
[01:13:57] readers might interpret this description as meeting, meaning that the Japanese army
[01:14:01] unilaterally massacreed Chinese immediately after the occupation. This passage should be revised
[01:14:07] that it is not interpreted in such a way. And here's what the passage eventually got changed to.
[01:14:18] While battling the fierce resistance of the Chinese armed forces, the Japanese occupied
[01:14:23] Nanking and killed numerous Chinese soldiers and civilians, this incident came to be known as the
[01:14:29] Nan King massacre. That statement end quote, that statement might have been satisfied.
[01:14:35] That statement might have satisfied textbook sensors as a compromise between Anega's argument
[01:14:39] and the Ministry's position on the massacre. Unfortunately, the statement is simply not true
[01:14:44] because it implies that the massacre occurred in the heat of battle.
[01:14:52] Continuing on, the examiner demanded that Anega deletes his description of the rape itself,
[01:14:59] claiming that the violation of women is something that has happened on every battle field in
[01:15:03] every era of human history. This is not an issue that needs to be taken up with respect to the
[01:15:09] Japanese army in particular. Even the word aggression was deemed taboo. A aggression, the
[01:15:16] censors wrote, is a term that contains negative ethical connotations. And that spirit that you can
[01:15:26] see very clearly that spirit of the Niali carried on, which is why when this book came out, this book,
[01:15:33] the rape of Nan King, when it came out, there were still Japanese nationalists that were
[01:15:39] staunchly against it. But Iris Chang who researched independently and wrote with passion,
[01:15:49] and she gave it all. She was a daughter of Chinese American immigrants and her parents,
[01:15:58] by the way, had connections to Nan King and escaped there. Both her parents had made it to America
[01:16:07] and become college professors, and Iris was compelled to tell this story. But like I said in the
[01:16:22] beginning, she was so close to this story that it took a toll of its own. And she was a writer,
[01:16:30] obviously, she got her batches degree in journalism, and eventually a master's in writing
[01:16:34] from Johns Hopkins University, and there's actually a book that's written about Iris.
[01:16:44] And the book is written by Iris's mother. Whose name is Dr. Ying Ying Chang, and the book is
[01:16:54] called the woman who could not forget. And I'm going to bring you through some portions of this
[01:17:05] book. So this book again, this is about Iris Chang, and it's written by her mother.
[01:17:13] This is how she got, is how she decided she was going to write about this.
[01:17:17] Here we go, quote, although Iris talked to us about her many book ideas for her next book,
[01:17:24] whilst he was writing our first book, her decision to write the rape of Nan King came all the sudden
[01:17:29] December 1994. As Iris told us, and as described in the book, she made her
[01:17:35] reminder right about this most atrocious chapter of history when she was attending a conference in
[01:17:40] California on December 13th, 1994. At the conference, there was a photo exhibition of the war
[01:17:49] of the war crimes committed in China in the 1930s, taking when the Japanese Army invaded Chinese
[01:17:54] territory. Iris wrote in her book. The light heard so much about the Nan King massacre as a child,
[01:18:00] nothing prepared me for these pictures. Stark black and white images of decapatated heads,
[01:18:06] Bellies ripped open a nude woman forced by their rapists into various pornographic poses,
[01:18:12] their faces contorted into unforgettable expressions of agony and shame.
[01:18:17] And she continued, in a single blinding moment, I recognized the fragility of not just life,
[01:18:24] but the human experience itself. Later, she told us in a telephone update that she simply must
[01:18:31] write about the rape of Nan King for her next book. It was a moral obligation and it would be
[01:18:36] justice for the victims as well. In 1998, after the rape of Nan King had been published,
[01:18:42] one Japanese reporter interviewed Iris and asked her, why did you decide to write this book?
[01:18:47] Iris replied, when I was a little girl, my parents shocked me with the story of the rape of
[01:18:52] Nan King. They told me that the Japanese imperial army massacred thousands of civilians in the
[01:18:59] capital of China and butchered even small children. This left the powerful impression on me,
[01:19:05] and I went to local libraries to learn more details, but I couldn't find a shred of information
[01:19:10] on the subject. There was nothing in my local school libraries or public city libraries
[01:19:16] or in my world history textbooks. Still worse, my teachers were completely ignorant of this event.
[01:19:24] The event remained a question mark in my mind for years until I saw an exhibit of photographs
[01:19:29] on the subject in 1994. The horror of those photographs inspired me to write the book.
[01:19:39] So that's how Iris got involved in writing the book. As a writer, luckily she was also a
[01:19:46] prolific letterwriter. I'm going to quote a bunch of her letters because her mother saved a bunch of
[01:19:51] her letters. Here is one that describes, I think it's a good insight into what her personality was like,
[01:19:59] when she was actually writing the book. This was a letter to her mom about what she was doing on
[01:20:04] the day-to-day basis. As she's writing this book, and this was her second book. So she'd already written
[01:20:09] one book. It had done okay, but this one was her, you know, her current project and here's what she said about it.
[01:20:15] Quote, on a typical day, I would rise between seven or eight a.m. and take the bus to silver
[01:20:19] spring metro station. Fortunately, there was a bus stop directly across from Lee's house.
[01:20:25] The trip to the National Archives took about 45 minutes on public transportation, and the building
[01:20:30] was opened by 8.45 a.m. I spent my mornings in the military reference branch of the archives
[01:20:35] on the 13th floor, looking through finding aids and filling out cards to request boxes from different
[01:20:42] collections of papers. Dozens of boxes would be pulled from the shelves, placed on cards and made
[01:20:47] available to me in the second floor reading room, which stayed open until 9 p.m. on Tuesdays,
[01:20:52] Thursdays, and Fridays. I was usually there in the afternoon and evenings scanning documents,
[01:20:58] tagging the ones that pertained into the Nanking Masterker, and zero-oxing them as quickly as possible.
[01:21:06] So she's digging deep into this book, doing massive amount of research, and, you know,
[01:21:12] research back then was infinitely harder than it is now, because we have the internet.
[01:21:17] Now, as she began, she assembled all this information, and she was starting to speak about it,
[01:21:24] starting to write some articles about it before the book came out, and she was interviewed
[01:21:29] by the San Jose Mercury News, which was a big newspaper up in the South Bay area of, you know,
[01:21:34] the South Bay San Francisco, and when she got done with that interview, she started getting a little
[01:21:40] bit of recognition. So here's a letter to her mom. Dear mom, here's the latest exciting news.
[01:21:48] I shall be the Master of Ceremony's for what I believe will be the biggest rape of Nanking
[01:21:53] Conference ever. The event will take place at Stanford University. During the first weekend of
[01:21:59] December, hundreds of people from more than 50 activists or organizations all over the globe will
[01:22:03] be there, as well as representatives from all major news, media, organizations of California,
[01:22:08] China, and Japan. The goal of the three-day affairs to discuss legal strategy, how can we see
[01:22:14] seek reparations for the victims through international law and UN resolutions? How can we gather evidence
[01:22:21] of atrocity for atrocities for lawsuits? What methods should we use to force the Japanese
[01:22:26] to accept responsibility for its past misdeeds? So, she's in the game. She's getting after it.
[01:22:35] She's starting to get some leadership positions in here, and starting to get some recognition.
[01:22:43] Now, as she continues to work, here's another letter to her mom, Dear mom. Thank you for your
[01:22:48] inspirational email. I've been working on my book all week and feel more confident about my material.
[01:22:54] The sections of the book are so short that I organize each chapter as I would a speech.
[01:22:58] Thinking of the chapters as speeches forces me to distill each idea into a tiny, hard gem.
[01:23:07] Lately, I've been reading so many of the world's classic speeches for inspiration.
[01:23:13] They are breathtaking in their power and so much more pungent than prose. In the evenings,
[01:23:19] when I read the speeches of Napoleon or Clarence Darrell or Winston Churchill,
[01:23:24] I feel engaged in actual conversation with them. Words are the only way to preserve the essence
[01:23:32] of a soul. What excites me about speeches is that even after the speakers are dead and buried,
[01:23:39] their spirit lives on. To me, this is true religion, the best form of life after death.
[01:23:48] This is the first time I've ever devoted much attention to speeches. My previous reading
[01:23:55] had only consisted mainly of essays, plays, novels and poetry. Love, Iris. So it's pretty cool that
[01:24:03] you, first of all, I love that letter because she's recognizing the power of speech and she's
[01:24:09] realizing that what she's doing as an author is that's her, that's her, that's her mark that she's
[01:24:14] going to leave on the world. And it's very interesting that Ying Ying Chang is also an academic.
[01:24:19] She's obviously a really smart person and they're able to have these sort of intellectual conversations
[01:24:25] and letters and they're all a really good insight into what Iris is mind. What was going
[01:24:33] through Iris's mind as she did this. Now, the book comes out. It doesn't like jump out of the gates,
[01:24:43] but as it comes out, there's a little bit of a controversy about it and it's going to start
[01:24:46] to be some articles about it and some interviews and she's getting some interviews and the book
[01:24:50] starts to get some good traction. Back to the book, on January 14th, she flew to Washington for a TV
[01:24:56] interview with PBS. At the San Francisco Airport, she left a telephone message for us and said that
[01:25:04] she got an call from her publisher and that her book was number 15 on the New York Times best sellers
[01:25:10] list. Her voice told us she was weeping. I'm sure they were tears of joy.
[01:25:16] Shou Jen, which is the dad and I were jubilant. We could not contain our excitement for many days.
[01:25:23] In the next phone call, we said, Iris, you've made it. So, book hits the New York Times best
[01:25:30] seller. That's the game changer for Iris back to the book. On January 28th, Iris called us with
[01:25:37] excitement and said that Laurel Cook, her publicist and Jack McEwen of the CEO, had called her
[01:25:44] in the afternoon to tell her that her book was up to number 11 on the New York Times list.
[01:25:49] Her high-esspot yet, only two weeks after first making the list. When they called,
[01:25:54] she could hear wild cheering, whistling and clapping in the background. She was overjoyed.
[01:26:00] So, it's like the big thing is as a writer to make the New York Times list and her parents
[01:26:07] understand that too because they're academics and they're super stoked for Iris.
[01:26:14] Now, with the success starts to come some stress and that starts to reveal itself.
[01:26:22] Here's another letter that she wrote. Dear mom, I'm sorry that I sounded so rushed when
[01:26:28] you called me at Mirion's home. Sometimes I wonder if I've offended a lot of old friends in the last
[01:26:33] few months by not returning emails, phone calls and letters. Perhaps many people believe I've been
[01:26:40] corrupted already. It's true that I've neglected my loved ones for the last few months. I feel
[01:26:47] ashamed that I haven't yet brought you a mother's day gift or even a card. Only this note that I'm
[01:26:54] hastily writing for my laptop computer perched up on a bed and Diana Zekerman's house.
[01:26:58] How I wish you could have been there during the woman of the year ceremony. I told you,
[01:27:06] I told the audience how you inspired me over the years, how you served as my first role model.
[01:27:11] So, you've got another big award, a woman of the year. Please forgive me. I love you dearly,
[01:27:17] even though I haven't found the time to talk to you in the last few weeks. And in a few weeks,
[01:27:22] well, I'll be reunited and the book tour will finally be over. I feel like a soldier returning from a
[01:27:28] six month war. Love Iris. So, she's a person that feels guilt, you know, and the idea that she
[01:27:37] hasn't been returned in emails and phone calls and she feels bad about it. And then I found
[01:27:42] this interesting perhaps many people believe I've been corrupted already. So, you made it big time
[01:27:46] and now you're blowing me off. She's feeling that pressure too. Back to the book, when Iris's
[01:27:55] book became an international bestseller, she reads to status most writers can only dream of
[01:28:01] she became a celebrity. But she also paid a price for it. In February 1998, after a long
[01:28:09] book tour, she'd already told us that once she came home, she did not want to go out anymore.
[01:28:14] All she wanted to do was stay home with Brett, that was her husband, she'd been married now
[01:28:19] and have a good sleep. After several weeks of continuous book signings, public speeches,
[01:28:25] and traveling, she said, her life was a nonstop blur of airport, lecture hall, hotel, airport,
[01:28:31] lecture hall, hotel. The responses to her speeches were overwhelming, wherever she went,
[01:28:37] people besieged her after every speech. When she came home, she inevitably came down with a
[01:28:43] cold or a flu only to recover in time for the next book tour. She was physically exhausted.
[01:28:50] Not only that, but during the book signings, many old Asian people came up to her, Chinese,
[01:28:56] Korean, Filipino, Singaporean, Indian, they poured out their personal stories of suffering during
[01:29:03] World War II in Asia to her. Some of them were wept and thanked her for profusely,
[01:29:09] for writing such a book. They said it's so frustrating to see that Japan to this day hasn't
[01:29:14] formally acknowledged their war crimes. They exclaimed it's about time. I was said,
[01:29:20] all that on the one hand, she felt rewarded that she was sought out and greatly respected by many
[01:29:25] people, but on the other hand, she was mentally and emotionally drained after hearing those stories.
[01:29:31] On June 29, 1998, I was wrote, Dear Mom, I arrived safely in New York today after giving a
[01:29:39] well-received speech and Baltimore to the women doctors. Actually, it was very depressing.
[01:29:47] During the Q&A, a Pakistani doctor told the audience about the atrocities against Bengali,
[01:29:52] women in 1971. A Filipino doctor described how she escaped the rape of Manila when she was 12,
[01:29:58] and an Indian doctor had discussed the Indian tradition of Suti, which is the burning of widow's
[01:30:04] alive. Others talked about the international sex slave industry, the trafficking of women and
[01:30:12] children, female genital mutilation in Africa, you get the idea. It seemed there were endless
[01:30:19] gruesome stories that people weren't eager to share with her. On top of her busy schedule of book
[01:30:31] tours, outside people might not realize that besides her traveling, signings and books, and speeches,
[01:30:36] she was constantly bararded with additional email requests from news reporters for written interviews.
[01:30:42] Sometimes there were 10 or 15 written questions for her to answer, so the reporters could write a
[01:30:46] news article in profile. I risked to still could find time to answer those questions accordingly.
[01:30:53] So she's just a go-getter, right? She's not stopping regardless of what's happening.
[01:30:59] And now, as this book is gained all this popularity, now she's starting to get some attacks as
[01:31:05] well from, like I said, from the Japanese nationalists that are saying, oh, this didn't happen.
[01:31:09] You're glorifying it or you're making it sound like worse than it was. And here's the letter
[01:31:14] that you wrote, Dear Mom. Tonight I read an article about John Stomba, Stimebex life in the Lascato's
[01:31:21] Mountain area, and learned that the reception of the grapes of wrath mirrored that of the rape of
[01:31:26] Nanking. In a letter to a friend, Stimebex wrote, the vilification of me out here from the large landowners
[01:31:34] and bankers is pretty bad. The latest rumors started by them that the Oki's hate me for lying
[01:31:40] about them. So I'm frightened at the rolling might of this thing. It is completely out of hand.
[01:31:49] I mean, the kind of hysteria about the book is growing that is not healthy.
[01:31:54] Love Iris. So she feels the same way that she's starting to, this book is almost becoming
[01:31:59] more powerful than she, you know, more than she can control. And here's another letter that she wrote.
[01:32:10] A few nights ago, I leafed through Richard Rhodes autobiography, a hole in the world
[01:32:17] after I lunch together. As you know, Rhodes was starved, beaten, and psychologically
[01:32:23] abused as a child by his stepmother. His mother had committed suicide by shooting herself
[01:32:30] and his father degenerated into an alcoholic, leaving him virtually incapable of protecting his family.
[01:32:36] Every time I reread this book, I'm convinced that Richard Rhodes is lucky to be alive.
[01:32:41] He was a genuine victim, but even his experience pales and comparison to the stories of abandoned
[01:32:48] children in the PRC orphanages. That's people in public, China. I don't even want to get into that right now.
[01:32:57] Delving into history into other people's stories places all our problems into perspective.
[01:33:04] Time and again, we have to remind ourselves how extraordinarily lucky we are.
[01:33:10] Much love, Iris.
[01:33:12] It clearly, that's something that I talk about on the regular basis. You look at the suffering
[01:33:18] that other people go through and it reminds you of how lucky we are not to be in those situations.
[01:33:25] But it seemed like Iris was having a hard time maintaining that.
[01:33:30] Positive outlook and she's keeps getting dragged down into the darkness.
[01:33:34] This is back to the book. Hearing that peanuts cartoonists, Charles Schultz had died.
[01:33:43] Iris was quite sentimental and wrote me a letter.
[01:33:48] And here's the letter, quote, dear mom, I have a favorite ask you. Can you save the last
[01:33:53] peanuts comic strip that appeared yesterday and mail it to me? I'm still reeling from the news
[01:33:58] of Charles Schultz's death. It's the end of an era. I still remember all the hours I spent
[01:34:06] reading peanuts books as a child. Do you recall the time we went together to a garage
[01:34:10] stale and champagne and you brought me my first Snoopy cartoon book, a used paper back already yellow
[01:34:15] with age? That's when I first fell in love with the peanuts comics strip. You and Dad grew up with
[01:34:21] the peanuts cartoon as well. And Chinese newspapers and Taiwan making both of you part of the
[01:34:26] peanuts era as well. Years later in Santa Barbara, I met Charles Schultz in person at the SB
[01:34:34] Riders Conference. During his lecture, however, I was surprised by his demeanor, which was
[01:34:39] bitter, gloomy and depressed almost nasty. After his lecture, I stood in a long line waiting
[01:34:46] for Schultz to autograph a copy of his book. When I finally stood in front of him, I asked Schultz
[01:34:51] if I could write a profile about him for the New Yorker or some other major magazine.
[01:34:55] Why is a young person like you interested in an old man like me was his response?
[01:35:01] At the time, I thought he was being sarcastic, but later I learned that Schultz,
[01:35:06] like Charlie Brown, is a terribly insecure person, fundamentally convinced of his own unworthiness.
[01:35:13] That was the last time I ever spoke. I ever saw Schultz. But last year, I had one more opportunity
[01:35:19] to see him. To make a long story short, I didn't have time to make the long two-hour drive to Santa
[01:35:24] Rose, and I figured I would see Schultz at the next Santa Barbara's Riders Conference.
[01:35:28] I never expected that Schultz would pass away only a few months later.
[01:35:34] Do you think Charles Schultz committed suicide? Don't you find it odd that he died the night before
[01:35:40] his final strip ran in the Sunday newspaper? As you know, the peanuts ran from 1950 to 2000,
[01:35:46] a perfect 50 years. And he died right when the strip ended. But life is seldom as neat and tidy
[01:35:54] as a cartoon box. It's almost as if he timed his dramatic exit from this world,
[01:35:59] achieving his final deadline. Love, Iris.
[01:36:07] Continue gone. It seems like Iris could not get the death of Charles Schultz off her mind.
[01:36:13] The next day she wrote, to me again about him, dear mom, I think it was Charles Schultz's
[01:36:18] pessimism, as well as the ability to understand human failure in security, heartbreak that made
[01:36:23] millions love peanuts. You're absolutely right, Schultz had no reason whatsoever to be depressed
[01:36:29] after achieving wealth and fame at such an early age. But the pression is not rational.
[01:36:36] Perhaps he did have a mental problem or some chemically induced condition, but whatever it was,
[01:36:40] it prevented him from losing touch with the underdogs of the world. It's strange. But I still feel
[01:36:48] avoid in my heart after Schultz's death, even though I never knew him and didn't particularly
[01:36:52] like him after our meeting in person. It made me wonder, what is the secret to Schultz's magic appeal?
[01:37:00] The answer, I believe, is simple. Schultz understands a heart of a loser. He capture those
[01:37:06] moments in life when we feel utterly unloved, unwanted and alone. All of us, no matter how successful,
[01:37:18] have felt like losers at some point in life. Love, Iris. So we start to see there's a
[01:37:29] an indication, right? There's an indication she's sort of seeing things like depression in other
[01:37:35] people, regardless of how successful they are at this point. She's a New York Times best seller,
[01:37:41] woman of the year, all this other stuff. So she's successful. And yet she's recognizing how that
[01:37:46] doesn't really mean anything and you can still be depressed. After September 11th, 2001,
[01:37:57] she wrote this on a few days after it, she wrote this again to her mom and dad in this case.
[01:38:05] Quote, events are unfolding faster than I can react to them. First, the WTC and Pentagon
[01:38:12] tragedies, then the Japanese prime minister's unexpected apology to the comfort of women and now
[01:38:17] a major court victory of a former Korean slave labor against the Japanese corporation.
[01:38:23] This week, I tried to work on my book and recover from general exhaustion and a mild case of
[01:38:29] the flu, but I have to admit it's hard to stay focused. I plan to do nothing more than right,
[01:38:36] exercise and rest for the next few weeks. Love, Iris. So she's now working on her next book,
[01:38:43] still working hard, probably working too hard, not focusing enough. And her mom, now she's got a
[01:38:50] kid as well. And we know that adding a kid into the mix doesn't give you more free time. We can promise
[01:38:56] you that. And she's married. Now she has a son and her mom actually started putting some
[01:39:05] pressure on her and said, hey, you got a kid now, you got to spend maybe you're going a little
[01:39:10] overboard with the work back to the book on October 3rd, 2003, and an email I asked Iris
[01:39:17] whether she was putting too much emphasis on her career placing her career before her family.
[01:39:21] She replied, that is not true. It's just that I believe that I have some power to shape my destiny
[01:39:27] and I want Christopher. That's the son. I want Christopher to have his mother a strong,
[01:39:33] to have in his mother a strong role model, a person who is his own individual, impervious to the
[01:39:38] whims of others. I cannot teach Christopher to be an intellectual and a socially responsible
[01:39:45] person, unless I demonstrate to him through my actions that I myself am such a person. I want to
[01:39:50] teach Christopher that it is far better to be long to the critical minority than the unquestioning
[01:39:58] majority. I want to teach him the ability to think independently to evaluate ideas and information
[01:40:05] on his own without the official sanction of the authorities and if possible to create.
[01:40:10] These qualities are not universally popular in our society. My tendency to stand alone apart from
[01:40:17] the crowd has caused me a great pain and suffering throughout my life. But in the end,
[01:40:24] I am stronger and better person because of it.
[01:40:27] Now, she's continued on and she's continued to just kind of grind and grind and grind and
[01:40:41] there's an incident. She's gone on a trip to Louisville, Kentucky and things start going sideways
[01:40:54] back to the book. That night, we went to sleep and assumed that Iris would be all right. But
[01:40:58] about 2am, California time in the early morning of Friday, August 13th, we were awakened by a phone call.
[01:41:05] I picked the phone and it was Iris. Her voice was shaking and she told me she'd seen some
[01:41:09] frightening pictures on the TV and her hotel room. Iris and I then had a conversation about this.
[01:41:15] Apparently she could not fall asleep so she turned on the TV. I asked her what kind of pictures
[01:41:19] were on the TV screen. She said it showed some horrible atrocities and ugly images of children
[01:41:24] torn apart by wars. She said that the TV was showing something similar to scenes from hell,
[01:41:31] like an unimaginable world war 3. She had turned off their TV, waited a while, and then
[01:41:37] turned it on again to find the ugly images had disappeared. I responded that maybe the TV had
[01:41:43] been showing a war movie. It's very possible I said that during the wee hours of the night TV
[01:41:47] stations would show such a genre of horror films. Then Iris told me she did not feel
[01:41:54] things had been quite right from the very moment she'd arrived at the hotel. The clerk at
[01:41:59] the front desk looks suspicious to her and spoke to a person who later kept looking at the window
[01:42:05] of her room. While Iris was still talking with me on the phone, she told me that she could still
[01:42:11] see that person standing outside on the lawn and not far from her room. He looked at her window
[01:42:16] and as she peered through her curtain. She told me she's specter her room was wired and that
[01:42:23] what she had seen on TV was real and intentionally shown to threaten her. So she's getting paranoid.
[01:42:30] She's paranoid that Japanese nationalists are coming after her and it's starting to affect her
[01:42:35] mind. Back to the book it was past 5 a.m. in Kentucky. I asked her had she gotten any sleep at all.
[01:42:40] She said she couldn't fall asleep and she was exhausted and had a terrible headache. She was sick
[01:42:45] I could tell. She had to be ill because she had not been able to sleep for three or four days prior to
[01:42:51] the trip. She also had not eaten nor she drunk any liquid for some time. She said she'd ordered
[01:42:56] some takeout dinner that was delivered to her room but she did not have any appetite and had
[01:43:01] eaten anything. She didn't want to drink anything either afraid that someone might poison her.
[01:43:07] I knew that under severe sleep deprivation people could have delusions. So her parents decided they're
[01:43:19] going to fly well she has a breakdown and they get a call saying hey something happened to Iris
[01:43:24] you need to get out here they fly out to Louisville as soon as they get to Louisville they go to
[01:43:30] a hospital when she gets to when they get to a hospital they go to find her and she's in the psychiatric
[01:43:36] unit and they she sent the psychiatric unit because they hadn't found anything wrong with her
[01:43:42] physically which you know would include in my opinion that includes like she's not dehydrated
[01:43:47] she's not starving she's got some psychiatric issues. So back to the book in the evening the
[01:43:54] doctor finally came in and met with us. He briefed us on Iris's condition in front of all of us.
[01:43:58] He believed Iris had experienced a so-called brief reactive psychosis due to stress conditions
[01:44:04] such as lack of sleep and food. He added that her condition could also be a possible onset of
[01:44:11] bipolar disorder and recommended that Iris he had doctor for follow-up after her return home. He gave
[01:44:18] us a reference. He also prescribed an anti-psychotic drug, respiratory, respiratory, two milligrams a day
[01:44:28] for Iris to take for at least a year and then they they getting the cab and as she's getting the
[01:44:37] cab she's kind of like making statements and saying strange things about what she sees billboard
[01:44:42] she's making strange comments about them and finally they landed San Jose Airport and go back to the
[01:44:48] book we called Michael and that's that's the son or Iris's brother we called Michael to come pick us up
[01:44:55] while we were waiting for Michael I resed that she felt dizzy and had a headache she told me that
[01:44:59] things seemed distorted to her and that the expressions of people around her were strange.
[01:45:05] At that time we did not know how powerful psychiatric drugs were and thought that Iris's behavior
[01:45:10] was strange. I later realized that while in the hospital Iris had been given heavy doses of
[01:45:16] risk-bredal and a tranquilizer calmer down the side effects of psychiatric drugs could be severe
[01:45:22] that explained why she felt dizzy and had a headache and distortion of a visual perception.
[01:45:30] So she's now on these drugs she's she's taking the the the whispered raw two milligrams a day
[01:45:38] the medicines making her super sleepy and once they're back in the bay area the mom
[01:45:46] yinging starts looking for a you know board certified psychiatrist to bring her to and she ends up with
[01:45:54] this guy that they called doctor B. Back to the book Iris is now seeing doctor B once a week and she
[01:46:00] persuaded him to reduce her dosage of risk-bredal risk-bredal by half from one milligrams or from
[01:46:08] two one milligrams from from two down to one from the very beginning Iris did not like to take
[01:46:15] any drugs and she kept trying to reduce the dosage or stop it entirely. The rest of the family
[01:46:21] was hoping that with the risk-bredal Iris would be less depressed but to no avail there was no difference.
[01:46:28] So interestingly Iris is saying I don't want to take this drug you know I want to get off of it
[01:46:33] and they're all saying look just keep taking it and eventually he describes her with another
[01:46:42] drug which is called amplify and as soon as her back to the book as soon as Iris took the
[01:46:48] amplify 10 milligrams she became excessively sleepy she could sleep for 12 hours or more
[01:46:53] straight. So now she's sleeping I mean 12 hours a day bad and back to the book Iris felt that her
[01:47:01] illness and inability to take care of Christopher was a burden to everyone something she hated.
[01:47:06] I could see that she was very sad and felt helpless. So this continues on and finally they go
[01:47:13] back to a meeting with Dr. B. Dr. B. Stundesol with what he said next and a very serious tone he said
[01:47:19] he thought Iris's condition was very grave and he suggested that Iris check into a recovery facility.
[01:47:25] He said that the facility was in in Salt Suledo near the beach it was quite ideal for mental
[01:47:30] patients to recuperate as soon as Iris heard that she immediately showed her disapproval I could
[01:47:35] understand her suspicion of any facility designed for so-called mental patients. She had learned
[01:47:40] many historical instances of government persecution of political dissidents one way was to put those
[01:47:46] dissidents into mental institutions and abused them sometimes leading to death. I did not blame her
[01:47:52] for her suspicions she was already suspecting that evil forces were at work against her for what
[01:47:57] she had written and done in the name of justice. Dr. B. She told Dr. B that she did not think her
[01:48:04] mental state was that bad and that she didn't need to go to recovery facility. So they started
[01:48:10] looking for someone else to take her to besides Dr. B and now she gets prescribed another drug
[01:48:21] which is called Selexa and so she's on Alexa and she's on Abul Fai and back to the book at this
[01:48:32] time, sorry, a billify. At this time Iris was already experiencing the strong side effects of
[01:48:38] a billify. Most obvious were her lack of energy and the fact that she was drowsy all the time. In
[01:48:43] addition when she woke up from her daily naps, she complained that her shoulders and leg joints
[01:48:46] were sore which were new symptoms that she thought likely to have been caused by the drug. I was
[01:48:53] worried about the side effects of a billify and voiced my concern to Dr. B. He said the dosage was
[01:48:59] the lowest possible and that the side effects would gradually disappear. In retrospect, it appears to
[01:49:05] us that a billify had a big impact on Iris's mental state. It was a turning point in her condition
[01:49:11] became worse after she started taking a billify and later worse and even more with Selexa.
[01:49:23] So now another incident takes place. She kind of disappears for a little bit. No one really knows
[01:49:31] where she is. They call the cops to find out eventually. She calls back and she says, hey, look,
[01:49:40] I was out. I was tired. I checked into a hotel to get some sleep. That's the story she tells.
[01:49:46] And her mom says she sounds guilty as she's trying to tell this story. And then a few days later,
[01:49:53] they find the sleeping pills and a bottle of vodka and they're kind of realized that she
[01:50:03] was thinking about committing suicide but her mom says she probably is going to do a room to do
[01:50:08] that and fell asleep. When she woke up, I guess she changed her mind. And back to the book here
[01:50:16] on the drugs that she was taken, we now know that a billify website warns that the drug can affect
[01:50:21] your judgment, thinking or motor skills as well as the side effects of increasing risk of suicide,
[01:50:26] drowsiness, anxiety and muscle stiffness. And the Selexa website warns about suicide, anxiety
[01:50:34] and self-destructive or aggressive impulses. So these drugs that you take for these problems have
[01:50:42] side effects that sound worse than what the problem is. Then she goes on to say that the first attempt
[01:50:50] to suicide that she made, so this the temple was when she was on 10 milligrams of a billify.
[01:50:57] And the other thing that that mentions in these about these drugs is that when you change
[01:51:04] prescription and when you change doses or you go on or off of them, that's when you're most vulnerable.
[01:51:11] And so that suicide attempt was in line with one of those changes.
[01:51:16] So they go back to, now they're with another doctor, doctor who they call doctor C.
[01:51:30] Going back to the book, I restopped taking Selexa on October 7th after the support group meeting.
[01:51:34] She told Dr. Sele on the phone that she would discontinue seeing him if he insisted on
[01:51:38] her taking the medicine. As a compromised doctor C persuaded her to continue seeing him and then
[01:51:44] he would decide whether she could gradually decrease the dosage of whispered all which she was still
[01:51:49] on. All of us told Iris that both the medication and the psychotherapy sessions were needed
[01:51:54] for rapid recovery. If she didn't want to take the medication, then at least she should have
[01:52:00] psychotherapy sessions with the doctor. She agreed to continue seeing Dr. C looking back at what
[01:52:06] ended up happening. It was so ironic. Iris was the one who did not want to take the medication
[01:52:11] whereas the rest of the family believed in doctors and thought the medication would help her.
[01:52:24] Continuing on, the morning of Thursday, October 21st when I went to Selexa,
[01:52:28] she was very unhappy and complained that I was following her too closely.
[01:52:33] I found she had not eaten well the night before, so I suggested going out for lunch.
[01:52:38] We drove to nearby restaurant. In the parking lot when she stopped the car, she sat there and told
[01:52:43] me without any expression that she wanted to cry but had no tears. Her face was greenish and
[01:52:51] an horrible depressed state. At this time, she had already mentioned that she did not want to live
[01:52:56] anymore. I also noticed that her arm and leg movements and facial expressions were rigid
[01:53:02] and it seemed even worse that she wanted to cry but had no tears.
[01:53:09] Back then, I did not suspect that all these symptoms could be the serious side effects
[01:53:16] of the medications.
[01:53:18] Iris began to feel hopeless. I later realized. She wanted to carry out her plan and she did not
[01:53:35] want us to find out. In the last week of her life, she prohibited me from visiting her.
[01:53:41] She did not even want me to call her and did not return my calls or my emails. In that final
[01:53:49] week, Shao Jin and I took a walk ourselves to ease our worries. I went to Apollo Altus support group
[01:53:57] on Wednesday, November 3rd. Shao Jin and I went to another support group in San Jose on Friday,
[01:54:02] November 5th. We tried to gather information on how to deal with the pressure and loved ones who
[01:54:08] were possibly suicidal. For all this time, she was actively planning her final exit while we tried
[01:54:17] to find a way to rescue her. We raised against her and we did not realize that she would carry out
[01:54:25] her plan so quickly. One week later, on November 9th, she was gone.
[01:54:41] And here is the note that was found next to Iris' computer. Dear Brett, mom, dad, and Mike.
[01:54:58] For the last few weeks, I have been struggling with my decision as to whether I should live or die.
[01:55:03] As I mentioned to Brett, when you believe you have a future, you think of terms of generations
[01:55:12] and years. When you do not, you live just by the day. You live not just by the day, but by the minute.
[01:55:22] You don't want someone who will live out the rest of her days as a mere shell of her former self.
[01:55:34] I had considered running away, but I will never be able to escape from myself and my thoughts.
[01:55:43] I am doing this because I am too weak to withstand the years of pain and agony ahead.
[01:55:47] Each breath is becoming difficult for me to take. The anxiety can be compared to drowning in an
[01:55:56] open sea. I know that my actions will transfer some of this pain to others, indeed those who love
[01:56:05] me the most. Please forgive me. Forgive me because I cannot forgive myself.
[01:56:17] Love, love, Iris.
[01:56:31] And Iris's mom closes out the book saying it was an untimely death. Over the years, Iris had
[01:56:47] always commented that life was too short for her to finish the things she wanted to accomplish.
[01:56:53] She said many times that she wanted to write more books to make films and record more oral histories.
[01:57:02] It was so painful to realize that many of her dreams were not fulfilled.
[01:57:08] Yet it is not how she died, but rather how she lived that will be her legacy.
[01:57:16] Whenever I think of Iris, the memories of a loving daughter and a beautiful soul
[01:57:21] will always remain with me. In her short 36 years, she had inspired many, many people in the world
[01:57:31] with her noble spirit, her passion, dedication, sincerity, and determination.
[01:57:38] In preserving historical truth and pursuing justice for the voiceless victims.
[01:57:43] Iris was a woman whose heartbeat passionately for those who suffered.
[01:57:51] She was a woman who could not forget. She could not forget their agony and she refused
[01:57:59] to let their stories go untold. Iris's life was short, but brilliant.
[01:58:08] Like a splendid rainbow across the sky, one that the goddess she was named after would be proud of.
[01:58:16] Iris's rainbow was magnificent, vanishing quickly.
[01:58:34] A rainbow vanishing quickly.
[01:58:47] And I guess that that is what we all are.
[01:59:02] Parainbo vanishing quickly.
[01:59:04] But before we vanish, I say, shine.
[01:59:22] Shine. All that darkness in the world be the light, be the color, be the good and the strong
[01:59:41] and the brightness that drives away the dark.
[01:59:44] We have one chance here.
[01:59:56] One chance, one opportunity to stretch across the sky and shine.
[02:00:02] Shine. Value that. Value that value life in no death a light will spread.
[02:00:25] And good will prevail. It will prevail over evil so long as we stand up.
[02:00:43] Stand up against all that wickedness in the world.
[02:00:48] We stand up.
[02:00:58] Shine.
[02:01:06] And I think that's all I've got for tonight. Echo.
[02:01:13] Yes. What you go ahead and take the mic for a minute there.
[02:01:21] While I decompress it around the side.
[02:01:25] I was stalking with Greg Trane yesterday.
[02:01:32] And you can complain about something where you can't embrace.
[02:01:37] This is one of the big things that I learned from you.
[02:01:39] And when you look at your own situation, you can compare to other past situations that are way worse.
[02:01:47] Your situation isn't that bad. That's what you start with.
[02:01:51] Then you go on to my situation. These are small teeny tiny challenges that all you have to do is approach.
[02:02:00] This way of embracing it.
[02:02:04] You're feeling frustrated about your situation.
[02:02:08] When you put in perspective, these are small challenges that you just got to overcome.
[02:02:14] You take it on as you want to put more work on my plate at work.
[02:02:19] Because I can handle it. I'll do it the best and watch me work.
[02:02:24] That is good. When we had Tim Ferriss on here.
[02:02:31] And when I did Tim Ferriss interview the first time I was on his podcast.
[02:02:35] It's the thing that I talked about when he came on here.
[02:02:38] He asked the question, how close do you get to the darkness before it consumes you?
[02:02:44] I've talked about before. If you stare into the soul of a monster, you have to be careful because you might become a monster.
[02:02:53] Yeah.
[02:02:54] I think the drugs that she got put on Robach, in this world, when she saw was the bad.
[02:03:04] I think that Tim Ferriss's point where he was saying to me,
[02:03:08] how often should I get close to the darkness? How often should I look at that?
[02:03:15] My response was in order to know the light, you got to know the darkness.
[02:03:20] But you can absolutely go too far in that direction.
[02:03:26] Yeah.
[02:03:26] And you can say to yourself, wow, the world is evil and everyone's evil and underneath the surface.
[02:03:33] Everyone can turn into this Imperial Japanese soldier and commit these atrocities.
[02:03:37] And that is what you absolutely, I would say be careful.
[02:03:43] I don't know if that's the right word. I guess it is the right word be careful.
[02:03:46] But to me, what you have to do is you have to balance it. And to me, as an American, as a
[02:03:52] there's so much good, right? I think that people generally get jaded to all the good that's out there.
[02:03:59] And that's why I say hey, you know what? Look over here at the darkness.
[02:04:02] But for someone that's stuck in a horrible place, in a horrible situation in life,
[02:04:08] those folks got to look out and say, wait a second, there's not there's so much good out there.
[02:04:14] You know, if you take a, like that's clearly, I mean, you look at, look at Iris Chang.
[02:04:18] I mean, she is smart and successful and beautiful and well-liked and had a good, she came up with
[02:04:24] an amazing family. Her parents were a dordor, right? She had everything in her life was good,
[02:04:31] right? And she lost all that. You know what? It's like, if you talk to anybody that flies
[02:04:36] planes, right? If you go into a cloud, you lose your orientation. It happens in diving too.
[02:04:42] It happens when you're surfing. If you fall off a big wave and you're getting rolled around,
[02:04:46] sometimes it can be hard to tell which way is up, right? It can happen. You know, guys drive their
[02:04:53] airplanes, they get lost in a cloud, they drive their airplanes into a mountain or they drive it into
[02:04:57] the ground because they don't, they get disoriented and they lose sight of which way is up and
[02:05:02] you or your underwater and you lose sight of which way is up. That's what you have to watch out for.
[02:05:06] You got to be able to say, wait a second, if everything is black around me,
[02:05:11] okay, stop. Let me get oriented. Let me, let me check my control panel in the water. It's
[02:05:18] really easy. You got to look for bubbles, which way are the bubbles? The bubbles are going to go up.
[02:05:24] And so when you get trapped in that darkness, these people end up in these situations where
[02:05:28] everything looks black, stop. You're disoriented. You just can't see. You don't know the right
[02:05:34] direction. It's okay. Figure out where the bubbles are. They're going to go to the surface and
[02:05:39] when they get to the surface, there's going to be light and you're going to be okay.
[02:05:44] Obviously, Iris, she got trapped. Drag down and disoriented in the darkness and she couldn't figure
[02:05:51] out that she had a husband and a son and a family and a money and she had all these beautiful
[02:05:56] things in her life. Yeah, which a lot of times especially if you go full speed in that direction,
[02:06:02] where you don't know which way is up. So you're going down. Even the good things that come in,
[02:06:07] you know, even, you know, when you get paranoid, something good and you're like, that's bad.
[02:06:12] For instance, for instance, she's on a trip in Louisville, going to go do your speech or whatever,
[02:06:18] and someone's checking her in the hotel. Maybe someone was saying, oh, I think that's Iris Chang.
[02:06:21] I saw her in TV. And instead, she's thinking, oh, it's some nationalists that are coming to
[02:06:25] get me. So yeah, she was absolutely. So that's something that I think and it's something that for
[02:06:30] those of us that are not in that situation, how do you pay attention and observe people and make
[02:06:36] sure that your friends or people you know or people that are in bad situations? How do you make
[02:06:40] sure that they're getting enough that they know how to orient themselves and get back to the
[02:06:45] surface and get away from all that horribleness. When you approach thing and I was talking to Greg,
[02:06:50] that's kind of what, and this just reminded me of it. When you approach things like that, you,
[02:06:54] you know how like you said, you're going down. If you don't know which way is up, you're going down.
[02:06:58] A good thing, you're going to look at, that's a bad thing. Reenforcing my whole direction, by the way.
[02:07:03] So if you approach it in a way where things that even would be frustrating to like an everyday
[02:07:09] person, if you approach it like good, you know, I'm the one to do this thing, bring the challenge
[02:07:15] because the challenge is a good, you know, that's the approach that'll reinforce that way of thinking.
[02:07:20] Yes. So yes. You will be going, you know, and really when you explore darkness,
[02:07:27] that's not to embrace the darkness and be dark. Like I said, don't become the
[02:07:31] that's basically your trend of way ignorance. That's what you're doing. Yeah. Because you got no dark
[02:07:36] and it's your contrast. It's a contrast. You can see, okay, guess what? In, for this case, I mean,
[02:07:42] obviously, I pray I never have to read anything as heinous as that again and we're on the show.
[02:07:48] But that happened. Yeah. Right. That happened. Yeah. That happened. We should not. You shouldn't go
[02:07:55] through life and not realize that that happened. Yeah. That happened to you, that human being said,
[02:08:03] that the other human being is horrible as it is. You need to realize that that is a part of our
[02:08:10] human history. So that way you can say, you recognize and say, okay, this can happen.
[02:08:17] And we need to watch out for it. And yeah. So look out for your friends, keep them knowing that
[02:08:29] there's, keep them knowing which direction they're heading in and you see someone going sideways
[02:08:36] bring them grab them. Especially with the, I mean, this is kind of a specific to this story, but the
[02:08:41] the drugs, you know, when you take Medicaid, because that's a big one man, you can mess up your
[02:08:47] pre, even like how you said when you get off the drugs, you know, because these are all chemical
[02:08:52] things that you're made for certain things. For sure. So when that part goes sideways, you can't
[02:08:59] like reason necessarily with someone, you know, they can't reason with you can't reason with
[02:09:04] yourself, you know, stuff that would seem obvious. Hey, if I, you know, walk off this cliff,
[02:09:09] it's obvious that's bad. It doesn't really work that way. If like your chemicals are off
[02:09:13] definitely. So yeah, you kind of got to, you know, like look out for somebody if you can see that
[02:09:18] happening. Yeah, no doubt. And it's very, it's very interesting. The, the mind is so incredibly
[02:09:26] durable, but at the same time, it's just totally fragile and little, some little change to the,
[02:09:36] to the composition or to the, to the chemicals that are in or to the fought patterns that are
[02:09:40] in, you know, can be really drastic changes on a, on a person. Yeah, you ever have a real bad flu
[02:09:49] and a fever in the neutral. Yeah, I have. You know, and it's almost like a mix between
[02:09:58] dreaming hallucinating and like, because, man, it's like your thoughts are all jumbled up. Okay,
[02:10:04] you want, you want to tell you an echo story right now? Yes. This will be a stupid echo story.
[02:10:08] It's not a great story. So, so I was, like, 20, I was 23 years old or something. And I was doing
[02:10:17] the dishes, speaking of doing the dishes. I was doing the dishes. And I turned on the water and I
[02:10:23] didn't see what was happening, but this little stream, a tiny little stream of water had
[02:10:29] broken through the pipe at some point in the handle and it, and it started to land on my hand.
[02:10:36] Well, I didn't know that it was water because it must have been like the similar temperature to
[02:10:41] what my body was at the time. And so I see this and it looks for, for a quarter of a second,
[02:10:49] it looks like my hand is blistering. It's just, and it's spreading so rapidly. And for a quarter
[02:10:55] of a second, I thought to myself, I'm being attacked by chemical warfare and I'm going to die in
[02:10:59] the next half a second. I'm dead. I think we were doing some chemical warfare training or whatever.
[02:11:06] And so, at that moment, for about a half a second, I thought I'm about to die and it only lasted
[02:11:11] about, then either it lasted as water, and I said, oh, yeah, it's not. But my point is that
[02:11:17] mentally, yeah, what, if, you know, a different situation, I could get locked into that mode.
[02:11:22] And when you see Iris going, hey, these people are coming after me. If you get mentally locked
[02:11:26] in that mode and you start seeing things that are that, that, you start imposing or overlaying
[02:11:32] your reality over actual reality. You start augmenting reality yourself. That gets really, really scary.
[02:11:39] Yeah. Like when you think someone's mad at you, you're at that. You think someone's mad at you.
[02:11:44] So you're looking for all the little clues, you know, Peng, is this person mad at him here?
[02:11:49] Or are they not, and normal everyday stuff? You know, why didn't, why did she text me back
[02:11:54] quickly? Yeah, well, I know. I know, usually she puts a smiley face, no smiley face this time.
[02:12:00] You know, she hates you. Yeah, she's mad. I know, she's mad. Something's wrong.
[02:12:03] But yeah, so yeah, if you have me and while they're like, well, I don't know what time you're talking
[02:12:07] about. Yeah. Anyway, speaking of being mad or should I say the opposite of being mad. So
[02:12:15] this is what you do. Take alpha brain alpha brainy. The pre workout performance and strength.
[02:12:24] And go workout. See what happens. That will make the record report back. Yeah.
[02:12:29] Actually, that's something Iris and her mom both referred to a couple of times here. They were like,
[02:12:34] her mom would say, you know, I want to, I want you to go exercise with me. And I, you know,
[02:12:38] I should have put that in the podcast, but but hey, get the book and read it yourself. I mean,
[02:12:43] that's what you need to do. I should have said that earlier. The rap and anking absolutely, you
[02:12:47] know, get it. Try and read it when you're in a happy place, right? Yeah. It's hard, hard read.
[02:12:54] It's might be the hardest read of any read possible. I don't know what could be harder than that.
[02:12:59] And then the book, the woman who could not forget by Yingying Chang, which again,
[02:13:04] chronicles her life and it's a really beautiful story. And with, with obviously with a tragic ending,
[02:13:10] and hopefully lessons learned from it, one of the lessons being be physically, be physically active.
[02:13:16] And her mom was trying to get her to go to the gym with her and work out with her because there's no doubt.
[02:13:20] It's, it's, it's, it's physiologically fact. Physiological fact. When you work out, you get
[02:13:26] in door from your least, you feel better. 100%. Yeah. And it also, which is good. I just heard this on
[02:13:33] a Jo-Royan, and Dr. Ronda Patrick, is there any? She was talking about how working out exercise
[02:13:43] like is it is one of the more powerful anti-aging. Oh, for sure. So, you know, like when you get older,
[02:13:49] you know, you know, Alzheimer's. Yeah, yeah, yeah, she said not for physically aging, but for mentally
[02:13:54] mental aging. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, man, it's just all around good deal.
[02:13:59] Brad, this is so one time, I think I even mentioned, no, I didn't mention this. So one time, I
[02:14:06] I might have drank maybe the night before. This was like a few months ago. And I didn't work out for a while,
[02:14:12] you know, I was like, you know, immersed in, I don't know, work out. Either way, I didn't work. It was,
[02:14:17] no, no, I got sick, and then I got hurt. So, I can, you know. So you cured that with the bottle.
[02:14:24] Don't do that. I'm not. I'm gonna make myself better. No, you're not actually. Yeah.
[02:14:29] It works. Yeah, I probably compounded. Good. Continue your story until everyone whatnot today.
[02:14:33] Yeah, yeah. So don't do this. No, but there's happening. So at the, so boom, I was over the sickness
[02:14:38] my injury was good, and I worked and I worked up kind of hard, too. And it was weird because I went
[02:14:44] in the workout thinking, okay, I'm glad I get to go workout, but when when you're done,
[02:14:49] okay, I'll admit this. And I think a lot of people have these thoughts where
[02:14:52] maybe you've done something, like maybe you're routine for whatever reason is going over and over,
[02:14:59] like just real repetitive. And then after all, yeah, true, but I'm just saying, sometimes these thoughts,
[02:15:05] like, what does all this even mean? Like, what, what, what, okay, I'm gonna get this and this and
[02:15:11] it's like, you think too much. After a while, I can't. So at the end of life, it's like, okay, I did all
[02:15:17] this. I just, I don't know, it just didn't really, I was having some of those thoughts. They weren't
[02:15:23] like super heavier enough, but they're in there. They're like, okay, great. Anyway, so anyway,
[02:15:29] fast forward, I worked out, did the workout, God after it, textbook definition of God after it,
[02:15:37] that was workout. I was done in, and actually not even done, I was like in the middle of the workout.
[02:15:42] And I was like, dang, life has straight up meaning. Like, this is what life is. Not necessarily
[02:15:49] the workout, just saying everything I'm doing. You know, it was that feeling. Was that the Alpha
[02:15:55] Brain? I must have been. So what you're saying is get out of the right. I'm saying, I'm saying,
[02:16:01] go workout. Right, like that point. You got it. I'm not saying you got it, but I'm saying, if you
[02:16:05] want to, yeah, workout, workout for sure. Change your life. Take on it. Big
[02:16:11] tip. Yeah, so that Alpha Brain, um, that's a neutral pick. That helps your memory and whatnot.
[02:16:18] So anyway, if you're going to workout and you want to take some supplements, which I recommend now,
[02:16:23] I was never supplement person. I tried them, but never was really into them. Or I'd be like,
[02:16:29] you, you got to take this. Take the pre workout, performance and strength. That's what
[02:16:37] it's called. Check. Take that one. What about shrimp tech? I'd say take the shrimp tech.
[02:16:44] Who's being a pretty good? I've been stacking up on telling you. See, watch out. I haven't been
[02:16:48] taking shrimp tech. Oh, really? I feel like that's like cheating. Not cheating, cheating, but I mean,
[02:16:54] in due to it. I mean, I don't feel like it's cheating. No, it's not cheating, but I feel like
[02:16:59] said you thought it was cheating. I feel like, I'll tell you what, it doesn't matter. I mean,
[02:17:04] when it comes down to it, shrimp tech or no shrimp tech, bring it. Okay. Yeah. All right. None the
[02:17:12] less. My original point was, okay, working out, that's the enhancer. That's the enhancer. If you want
[02:17:16] to enhance the enhancer today, that's all I think. You keep making me think of more stuff. Okay,
[02:17:22] I'll stop talking. Yeah. And then I feel like, oh, I should talk about that anyway. Working out
[02:17:28] is important part. That enhances the life. Yes. Alphabran, these supplements, Alphabran,
[02:17:35] shrimp tech, all these other ones. That enhances the workout, which is the enhancer. So,
[02:17:40] enhance the enhancer kind of thing. Anyway, if you like these things, you want 10% off. You
[02:17:45] don't want a pay full price or maybe do I don't know. But if you don't go on it.com slash
[02:17:51] chocolate 10% off, support yourself as well and you're all it. I want to talk about Amazon, click through.
[02:17:59] That's a good way to support. That's good because it's like, you know, small little thing doesn't
[02:18:05] cost you anything as you always say. And, you know, big result, big support. Yeah, I'm going to make the
[02:18:13] sodium and the fish tank analogy. I'm going to do it. Really? Yeah. Good because I wasn't expecting
[02:18:18] that. Yeah, you throw the sodium in water and it blows up. Small species of sodium in the
[02:18:22] bone blows up. That's important that you said that, but what would be more important would be
[02:18:25] this actually say how you do Amazon click through. Yeah. So, yeah, I think you're right about that. So,
[02:18:30] what you do is you go to joccrackcast.com, little banner on the side. There's the the UK1.co.uk
[02:18:37] as well. Is there Germany? Yes, there's Germany. I think. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. It's right there on the
[02:18:44] side. Boom. The main one, the top one or the one on top is the US one, Amazon.com. Click through there
[02:18:50] before you do your Amazon shopping. That's the way to support. Doesn't cost you anything. Small
[02:18:55] action, big reaction. Be the sodium. Be the sodium. Jocco is a store. It's called jocco store.
[02:19:05] URL.jocco store.com. If you want shirts, disflin equals freedom, they're all jocco approved
[02:19:11] an official. Go on there. Look at them. If you like them, get a shirt. Get a shirt.
[02:19:17] By the way, they're not all jocco proof because I didn't approve the pink women's t-shirts. Yeah,
[02:19:21] that's true. That was not approved. Right. That was actually jocco on approved. Yeah. But we
[02:19:26] were mutiny and rebellion. Yeah, which is kind of part of the game too, right? No, not really.
[02:19:32] Well, according to the shirts that we got, it is. Yeah, apparently. So, that one is technically not
[02:19:39] jocco approved, but it's jocco on approved. So, it's dope nonetheless. And if you think they're
[02:19:44] solid, then yeah, get a shirt, man. Support that way. It's a good way to support. Yeah, there's some
[02:19:48] goodies on there in some rash guards. I've beginning to see more and more people with the rash
[02:19:53] guards. Yeah, the rash guards seem to be popular. Yeah. Yeah, we stay victory in my main fitness.
[02:19:58] Yeah. No, and online as well. See you guys doing it. Anyway, look at them. If you like something
[02:20:04] gets something that's a good way to support. Coming out with a new travel mug. No, it improved.
[02:20:10] No one improved. High quality. High ear quality. High ear quality. Yes, like, technically.
[02:20:19] Hold you. If you put something hot in there, hope makes it keeps it hot for a long time.
[02:20:22] L hours. If it gave hours or something like that, it's cold, same thing. I think cold keeps it
[02:20:27] long. It keeps it cold longer. Anyway, that'll be on the store in two weeks. Yeah. Also, good way to support.
[02:20:37] And this is actually supporting yourself big time. It's like a little helper. It's like when you're
[02:20:42] benching, you ever bench. I don't bench much anymore. Okay. So, in the event of you benching,
[02:20:49] this is what it's like. It's benching is the analogy. It's like someone's spotting you. If you need it,
[02:20:54] this is what it is. Psychological warfare. You like the it is, right? It's like a spot. You don't need it.
[02:21:00] You don't need it necessarily every day. You don't need it all the time. Maybe you do. Maybe you don't
[02:21:04] depends on, you know, a lot of things. But if you do need it, even if you just want it,
[02:21:08] hey, can you spot me? I might get the, I'll probably get all eight. Yeah. But you're there. You know,
[02:21:13] just in case. That's what this is. So, if you're like, hey, I'm gonna, okay, this is what it is
[02:21:17] for those who don't know. Like, people do know. But if you don't know, it's an album you can buy from
[02:21:22] iTunes with tracks on it for different scenarios of what weakness you'd call it. I'm a little bit
[02:21:28] of weakness. And you need a little spot and guess who's spotting you? Talk. That's the guy to spot.
[02:21:35] You're very dependable. Very reliable. punctual. All that stuff. They're like two minutes long.
[02:21:41] Give or take, yeah. There's one about, you know, before you're gonna go and eat,
[02:21:47] yeah. There's one called sugar coated lies. Yeah. I think that one might be a good one.
[02:21:55] You got the end of that one, which is, I think, one of the more memorable moments, lines,
[02:22:03] whatever. And you say something about mobilized your will, because your will is stronger than the
[02:22:10] will of a donut. Right. Yeah. So, factual. Bro, and that's the one you need. Isn't it pretty sad, though?
[02:22:16] You think you're self, okay. I'm not gonna eat this donut. Yeah. Because I'm just gonna hold my
[02:22:20] willpower, but then it's somehow the the will, because a war is a war of wills, right? That's the war
[02:22:25] is. So now if you lose that war against the donut, then your will is weaker than the donut.
[02:22:29] I'd know not to, yeah. That's not gonna happen. No, not without that. No, that's a
[02:22:33] more for a play. You put it into perspective. You're like, here's the donut and you're like,
[02:22:36] you're will is stronger than the donut. And then you eat the donut. You basically said,
[02:22:40] I understand that, send them this donut. Will is stronger than my,
[02:22:43] don't want to be that person. That's your life right there. Yeah. Man. Putting to perspective.
[02:22:47] Anyway, if you need that spot psychological warfare from Jaco Willing, do a search, I do.
[02:22:53] And it's also on other things that aren't iTunes. Yeah. So Amazon, music, it's on, it's on.
[02:23:00] It's no Google play. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. Anywhere that where you can get like MP3 music.
[02:23:04] Yeah. Is it called that anymore? MP, is that still a thing? MP3 music? Well, MP3 is just the
[02:23:09] file. Right. So, remember that you used to be MP3 players? Yeah. Yeah. Technically, everything.
[02:23:17] That can play MP3s isn't MP3 player. Yeah. So, yeah, get, check that one out. That one's a good,
[02:23:24] and it's a good way to support, you know. So that's it's all around circle of support in that way. Yeah.
[02:23:31] Also, if you want to get some Jaco White Tea, you can get it. You can get that on Amazon.
[02:23:38] And when you get it, I know some people are a little nervous when they try it for the first time.
[02:23:43] Just be careful. You don't want to, you know, be in a situation where you, you're going to go a little bit
[02:23:49] harder than normal, right? To be ready for that. When you bring out the Jaco White, you can get
[02:23:55] once you've used it before. You don't have to worry about there's no precautionary. Well, once you're
[02:24:00] once you're using it, yeah. But when you start, yeah, be careful. Because you're going to go
[02:24:04] with that little extra stuff that you're going to go on a tack mode. Yeah. It's kind of like when you turn
[02:24:09] on your car and the volume is up a little bit more than you're ready for. You're like, oh, but then
[02:24:15] if you do it again, you're like, I'm, you know, same thing. Same thing. So watch out for that Jaco White
[02:24:19] Tea on Amazon. Also, for international orders, it's on eBay. The official listing is of the Jaco
[02:24:26] podcast sold by Pearl Resourceing. So if you're international and you want to get it, you can do that.
[02:24:31] And for those of you that in America, there, it says you see that the shipping is $100. That's not
[02:24:38] for you to get it from there. It's for you to get on Amazon if you're in America. If you're overseas,
[02:24:46] the shipping won't show $100. We'll show whatever the cost is. So I've had a couple people like say,
[02:24:51] why is the shipping $100? It's not. It's Amazon Prime. The shipping is no cost. Don't get it from
[02:24:55] eBay. You understand what I say? So if you're in the US, if you're in the US and you made it, you're
[02:24:58] going to be going to be trying to get it. The shipping will show $100. Don't get it from eBay. You're
[02:25:02] not supposed to. We don't want to sell to everybody in America. We can't handle that. But we can sell
[02:25:06] to some people overseas. Here's what you do. Jaco Tea.com. And that has this information on the
[02:25:14] terms. So it doesn't have that particular information, but it's like just a basic website.
[02:25:20] Dang, we didn't. I don't know why I didn't mention this before. So basic website, it's like,
[02:25:24] oh, you're in the US order from here. Okay. And international order from here. Jaco Tea.
[02:25:29] There is. Jaco Tea.com. It's on Jaco. It's on Jaco Store 2, but it's like you got to go to the
[02:25:34] tab and then go to the page. You know, it's it's it's it's a thing. But go to Jaco Tea.com. If you if you're
[02:25:42] just down for the tea, just need the tea there you go. Yeah. All right. Well, that's well, thank you
[02:25:46] for informing us of that. Yet another website for those of you that are asking to get after it mugs,
[02:25:51] we're looking at March to be honest with you. So keep looking. Also, you know, kids,
[02:26:03] we got kids out there running around. We know that we know that kids are in
[02:26:06] pressional. Yes, right. As they're growing up, we know that we also know that it's hard to be a
[02:26:10] kid. Right. You come up against hard times. And if you want to help kids get through some hard times,
[02:26:16] you can order this book that I just wrote pre-order it. It's called Way of the Warrior Kid.
[02:26:26] And this is the weird thing about this book. So the other day I was talking to somebody,
[02:26:31] it might have even been you. After I got done with edits like the final edits, I was talking
[02:26:37] to someone. Yeah, you know, I just finished the final edits and I said, it's awesome. And then I
[02:26:43] felt kind of weird because it's not exactly the most humble way to describe your work, right? Nope.
[02:26:50] So I felt that. Like as soon as I said, I said, why am I saying that this book is awesome? That's
[02:26:54] not like me. I didn't walk around and go extreme ownership. It's a best book ever. Yeah, I think
[02:26:58] I'm all extreme ownership is awesome. I don't say, oh, listen to my podcast. It's awesome. No,
[02:27:02] I don't say that. I said, hey, you know, if you want to listen to it, it might be interesting.
[02:27:05] Oh, extreme ownership is good. You know, you might might get some value out of it. I'm not running
[02:27:09] around saying, I'm awesome. Yeah. Some reason I said, oh, this book, I just got done reading it,
[02:27:17] editing it. It's awesome. Right? So I kind of wondered why I said that and then I realized
[02:27:23] that, wow, I'm reading. Okay. So when I wrote it, right, I wrote it like I was in a 10 year old kid.
[02:27:30] Like, but that wasn't me. It was the guy that's in the book, Mark, because he's the character. Right.
[02:27:34] So when I read it, it sounds like him. It doesn't sound like me. It sounds like him. Yeah. So
[02:27:38] I read the book and I, I think it's him. That wrote it. This kid. Right. And I think to myself,
[02:27:43] someone said, how's the book? And I go, man, it's awesome. So yeah, that's what I realized. And
[02:27:51] but it is the kind of story that sounds, it's good to read. Mark the kid, the 10 year old kid.
[02:27:59] He's hurt. Right. He's made fun of. Can't do any pull-ups. Doesn't know his time
[02:28:05] to stay. It doesn't know how to swim. And he's getting bullied by Kenny Williamsson.
[02:28:12] Okay. You know Kenny Williamsson. We all know this. I'm going to post a picture. Can you? I haven't
[02:28:17] introduced Kenny Williamsson yet to the public, but I don't know get a picture out to him. So he's
[02:28:22] going through all this trials and tribulations about luckily his uncle Jake happens to be a big
[02:28:27] tough frog man. He's going to come and stay with him for the summer. And when, oh, guess what?
[02:28:32] But when, when Mark breaks down, because he doesn't tell his mom what's going on, because his
[02:28:38] mom just is kind of, you know, she doesn't, she doesn't quite, you know, you know what she's
[02:28:43] going to say? Oh, right. You'll learn that stuff. She could say, oh, honey, you're a nice boy. Don't
[02:28:49] worry about that big bully. He won't bother you anymore. No, no, my mom actually he will. Right.
[02:28:55] So, so Mark breaks down kind of, he won't tell his mom, but then uncle comes and his uncle's like,
[02:29:01] hey, we, you know, we're gonna hang out. What are you gonna do? Do anything I get swim breaks down.
[02:29:07] So, you know what uncle Jake says when Mark gets done listing all of his problems?
[02:29:12] They don't. He says, good. All those problems you got? We can take care of those problems. Those
[02:29:21] are all solvable. All we got to do is we got to work, we got to study, we got to train. And that's
[02:29:26] what they do. So, like I said, I won't say it's awesome. But from the perspective of the kid,
[02:29:35] when you look at it, if a kid wrote that, you'd say that's a pretty good story. You got there. And
[02:29:40] here's a deal. A pre-order on Amazon. Why? Why pre-order? Let me tell you why. They got to
[02:29:47] print it, right? And they're gonna print, they're gonna go, oh, you know, it's a kids'
[02:29:51] ball. And kids' books don't sound very well. So, you know, you just, we'll print out 80 copies.
[02:29:57] What are you know, we got their formula. They got their formula. Right? The formula's not going to work.
[02:30:02] Just like it didn't work for Jogway. The formula is not going to work. So, the earlier that you pre-order,
[02:30:09] the more they'll print, the then that we won't have the shortage, the scenario, the massive
[02:30:14] screaming in the street saying, give us a book. So pre-order and that'll take care of that while you're
[02:30:18] doing it, pick up, rape and anti-naking. Iris Chang. These will be on the Joggo podcast store,
[02:30:26] click through in the book section. No, not the store. Joggo podcast.com. Joggo podcast.com books

[02:30:37] up a couple copies of Extreme Ownership, which is the book written by myself and Lave Babin. And
[02:30:44] you know what? Get a few copies and I'll tell you why. Because you got to give them to your
[02:30:49] people on the team. Right? How many people write to me to I gave this to someone so and they said,
[02:30:54] thank you. Yeah, this is great. Get them home the game. You know they need it. If you didn't have it,
[02:30:59] would you want somebody to give it to you? Let me ask you that question. Yes, you would. It's going
[02:31:02] to help you out with your game. So you're going to want to do that. And by the way, if you're
[02:31:06] caught, if you're at your company, your business and you need some some leadership alignment,
[02:31:11] you're got some little situations going on, you can check out Lave Babin. I also we don't

[02:31:33] Extreme Ownership, we got the mustard coming, mustard number two, May 4th and 5th,
[02:31:38] Mary at Marquis New York City. Boom. Yeah. Now, you know, people talk about people say,
[02:31:47] oh, it's a game changer. Right. People say that. Sure. I think and then you usually go,
[02:31:53] really, they had changed. They got a new flavor of tortilla chips at the restaurant. It's a game
[02:31:59] changer. No, that's not a game changer. But description, kind of the most common description I've
[02:32:04] heard of mustard number one that we didn't send Diego is game changer. So people are getting after
[02:32:12] it leadership, management, health, due to the good stuff. Of course, I'm going to be there. Of course,

[02:33:50] and making things happen. And again, I know that this podcast was hard to listen to.
[02:34:06] I know that this episode was disturbing. And it was hard for me to read. But again, to me,
[02:34:24] it is a reminder. It's a reminder to all of us that darkness is real. And as I said, we cannot get
[02:34:35] lost in that darkness. And we can't let the people we know get lost in that darkness. And it's a
[02:34:41] reminder that we have to illuminate that darkness. And we cannot, we cannot let evil thrive and
[02:34:56] permeate, permeate. We can't let it permeate on a mass scale like an N. King or on a personal level.
[02:35:10] Like the beautiful Iris Chang. So get out there. Get out there. Live your life.
[02:35:29] Get after it. Get after it every day. Go out there into the world.
