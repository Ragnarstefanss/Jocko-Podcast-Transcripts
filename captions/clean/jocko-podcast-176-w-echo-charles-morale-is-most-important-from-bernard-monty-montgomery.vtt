1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is Jocopotcast number 176.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Good evening.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Usually, when I write a letter, it is very much overdue,

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and I make every effort to get it away quickly.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This letter, however, is different.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It is a letter that I hope you would never receive

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
as it is verification of that turse, black-edged card,

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which you received some time ago,

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and which has caused you so much grief.

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It is because of this grief that I wrote this letter.

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And by the time you have finished reading it,

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
hope that it is done some good,

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and that I have not written it in vain.

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It is very difficult to write now of future things

17
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in the past tense, so I am returning to the present.

18
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Tomorrow we go into action.

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
As yet, we do not know exactly what our job will be,

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but no doubt, it will be a dangerous one

21
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in which many lives will be lost.

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Mine may be one of those lives.

23
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Well, mom, I am not afraid to die.

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I like this life, yes,

25
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for the past two years,

26
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
have planned and dreamed and mapped out a perfect future for myself.

27
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I would have liked that future to materialize,

28
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but it is not what I will, but what God wills.

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Then if by sacrificing all this,

30
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I leave the world slightly better than I found it.

31
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I am perfectly willing to make that sacrifice.

32
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Don't get me wrong, though, mom.

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I am no flag waving patriot, nor have I ever profess to be.

34
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
England's a great little country, the best there is.

35
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But I cannot honestly and sincerely say that it is worth fighting for.

36
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Nor can I fancy myself in the role of a gallant crusader fighting

37
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
for the liberation of Europe.

38
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It would be a nice thought, but I would only be kidding myself.

39
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
No, mom, my little world is centered around you.

40
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It includes dad, everyone at home, and my friends,

41
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and Wolverhampton.

42
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
That is worth fighting for.

43
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And if by doing so, it strengthens your security and improves your lot

44
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
in any way that it is worth dying for too.

45
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Now, this is where I come to the point of this letter.

46
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
As I have already stated, I am not afraid to die,

47
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and then perfectly willing to do so.

48
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
If by my doing so, you benefit in any way whatsoever.

49
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
If you do not, then my sacrifice is all in vain.

50
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Have you benefited, mom, or have you cried and worried yourself sick?

51
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I fear it is the latter.

52
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Don't you see, mom, that it will do me no good,

53
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and that in addition, you are undoing all the good work I have tried to do.

54
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Grief is hypocritical, useless, and unfair,

55
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and does neither you nor me any good.

56
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I want no flowers, no epitaph, no tears.

57
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
All I want is for you to remember me and feel proud of me.

58
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Then shall I rest in peace, knowing that I have done a good job?

59
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Death is nothing final or lasting.

60
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
If it were, there would be no point in living.

61
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
It is just a stage in everyone's life.

62
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
To some it comes early, to others late, but it must come to everyone's time.

63
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Then surely, there is no better way of dying.

64
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Besides, I have probably crammed more enjoyment into my 21 years than some managed to do in 80.

65
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
My only regret is that I have not done as much for you as I would have liked to do.

66
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I love you, mom.

67
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
You are the best mother in the world.

68
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And what I fail to do in life, I am trying to make up for in death.

69
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So please don't let me down, mom.

70
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Don't worry, or fret.

71
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But smile.

72
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Be proud and satisfied.

73
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I never had much money, but what little I have is all yours.

74
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Please don't be silly and sentimental about it.

75
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And don't try to spend it on me, spend it on yourself or the kiddies.

76
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It will do some good that way.

77
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Remember that where I am, I am quite okay.

78
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And providing I know that you are not grieving over me.

79
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
She'll be perfectly happy.

80
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Well, mom, that is all.

81
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And I hope I have not written it all in vain.

82
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Good bye.

83
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And thanks for everything.

84
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:23.000
You are unworthy son, E4.

85
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And that was a letter from private E4, Roe Berry, who served in the British Army in the South

86
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Staffordshire Regiment and the letter can be found in a book called Last Letters Home.

87
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And it was his last letter home.

88
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:59.000
He was killed in Ochnem on 17 September 1944, in the opening action of Operation Market Garden,

89
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:10.000
which was conceived in planned and championed by Field of Marshall Bernard Montgomery.

90
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And this massive operation overall, it's generally assessed as a failure.

91
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Although history has been kind and some people look back and theorized that it did have a more positive impact on the battlefield

92
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:41.000
than was initially fought, but nonetheless, it didn't achieve objectives and there was a significant amount of casualties.

93
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And as I said, this was Monti.

94
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Monti's plan is the plan that he pushed.

95
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And as I said on the last podcast about him, this is one of the things that makes him controversial,

96
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that he led this operation, Market Garden.

97
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And as I said on the last podcast, he was able to redeem himself somewhat in the battle of the bulge,

98
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
but this negative was pretty impactful.

99
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And with that, that doesn't mean that there's nothing we can learn from that situation.

100
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And we covered it on the podcast, that battle from that perspective.

101
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And we have to learn from people's successes and people's failures just as we have to learn from our own successes and our own failures.

102
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And on the last podcast, we talked about Monti's in a few of leadership.

103
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And if you haven't listened to that podcast yet, it's number 174, that kind of talks a little bit more detail slightly about Monti and his thoughts.

104
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And we debated a little bit the meaning of the word dominate, which he kind of puts as one of these driving forces as a leader.

105
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
As the leader's ability to dominate.

106
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And I talked about how I'm not quite sure where he falls with that word.

107
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
You know, because dominate can have a very negative connotation.

108
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And I actually asked for feedback and a bunch of people gave me feedback.

109
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And I think I landed somewhere kind of in the middle.

110
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I don't think it's the dominate with the, with the, hey, I'm just going to roll over my people.

111
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I don't think that's how we meant it.

112
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
I think he, but I don't think he meant it in like, hey, I'm just dominate.

113
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I dominate my skills and that's why I'm good.

114
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I think he meant it somewhere in the middle.

115
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And then I talked about the fact that one of the other major important factors that Monti talks about is morale.

116
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And he wrote another little thing about morale called morale and battle.

117
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And I think I actually wish I would have covered this one first.

118
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And this one almost trumps the leadership.

119
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
His thoughts on leadership, because I think this is even more applicable and relatable.

120
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But it's, it's good solid stuff from someone that led massive numbers of troops in battle.

121
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And saw a lot of war in World War I and World War II, obviously.

122
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So with that morale in battle and we're going to jump right into it.

123
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Here we go.

124
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
This paper is an attempt to analyze what is at the root of morale in battle.

125
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And thereby to discover how it can be developed.

126
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Hymeral is defined as endurance and courage in supporting fatigue and danger.

127
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
In other words, the quality which makes men go forward in an attack and hold their ground in defense.

128
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
It is the quality without which no war can be won.

129
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So this is a, and I'll get to this in the end.

130
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
He talks about morale being the most important factor on the battlefield.

131
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Obviously, I think leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

132
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And I'll break that down a little bit later, but from his perspective as a guy that had led massive operations.

133
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
He feels morale is the most important thing.

134
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So without a doubt, it is important.

135
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Here we get into his thoughts on it.

136
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And again, I think you're going to see this, the stuff that he talks about morale.

137
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
He seems to nail this.

138
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I think even better than he nails leadership.

139
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So here we go, the quality of morale in war, the moral stature of some men increases and their characters grow stronger and more close.

140
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
closely knit in proportion to the discomforts and dangers which they are called upon to face.

141
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I said this over and over again.

142
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
War.

143
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
War can make you stronger.

144
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
War can make you a better person.

145
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
This is something that Peter T. and I talked about when he first came on the podcast and we talked about.

146
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Families that were slightly fractured. If they have a major incident, a medical emergency, somebody gets wounded, somebody gets cancer.

147
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
If the family's close, it'll make them closer.

148
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
If the family's fractured, it'll blow them apart.

149
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
He's saying the same thing here.

150
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Back to the book, such men will occasionally perform in battle, remarkable acts of self-lish courage and daring and will endure with extraordinary fortitude and patience.

151
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
The burdens thrust upon them.

152
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Other men, however, will under the stress of hardships or dangers surrender to fear or fatigue and will allow their characters to disintegrate.

153
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So the same thing that Peter T. was talking about with families and this is the same thing with any team or organization.

154
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
You have a team that's pretty close and they go through something rough. They get even closer.

155
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
You have a team that's kind of fractured and they go through something tough. They're going to explode.

156
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Same thing happens with people's personalities in character in war.

157
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:05.000
This disintegration is usually, will usually take the form of elucing of the moral fiber which results in timidity of action and slackness in appearance.

158
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
He talks a lot about appearance.

159
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
One of these guys.

160
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
In battle, men who have kept a firm grip upon themselves when a player will appear clean and vital in their appearance,

161
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000
while those who have gone to seed will be dirty and their appearance will be slobvenly.

162
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So he's one of those guys.

163
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Hey, if you don't look at this, obviously, this is the much of the military.

164
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
They will judge you on how you look.

165
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
That's not always true. Sometimes you get a guy that looks like a rogue, street person.

166
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And he's a good operator.

167
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And sometimes, not. It depends.

168
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Similarly, timid officers will be found during quiet periods in the line, grovelling in the filth of some seller,

169
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.000
while their signalers and runners separated from the light, attempt to do their jobs by the flame of a guttering candle.

170
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
In these latter cases, there's been a general loosening of the character due to a partial surrender to fear.

171
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So you get these timid officers there out there and they cower and they're scared.

172
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And they, while their troops are up, trying to do their job.

173
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
In extreme cases, men who have become afraid have sunk to the level of beasts.

174
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:37.000
No longer in full control of themselves. They have become as sheep or rabbits unable to act or loan or think rationally.

175
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Their instincts have become those of the herd.

176
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
They are either paralyzed by fear or gripped by un-reasoning panic, such manner exceptions,

177
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
but they are a reminder of the value of high morale.

178
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000
The good soldier, the man with high morale, has not surrendered to fear and has maintained his personal standards.

179
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:06.000
The bad soldier, the man with low morale, has become incapable of dependent action of independent action

180
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and has to some extent shed a part of his human individuality.

181
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So this is what you get. People had all freaked out and they don't act for themselves anymore.

182
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
They're just going to fall down hurt.

183
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Moral is a mental and moral quality. It is a quality peculiar to human beings because it is essentially the product of a mind with a conscience.

184
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000
It is that which in battle keeps men up on humanity's level, as opposed to being a beast.

185
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But humanity's levels are not high enough because the strongest human instinct is the instinct of survival.

186
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Moral is also that which develops man's latent heroism so that he will overcome his desire to take the easy way out and surrender to fear.

187
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So you got to be a little bit beyond human because the human instinct, the strongest human instinct, is I, I'm just going to stay alive. That's my goal.

188
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
You got to be more than that. You got to be better than that.

189
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:13.000
It is necessary now to make clear what high morale is not.

190
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000
It is not contentment or satisfaction bred from ease or comfort of living.

191
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Both of these contain a hint of complacency and acceptance of luxury as an and in itself.

192
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000
High morale is far more than any of these for it implies essentially the ability to triumph over discomforts and dangers and carry on with the job.

193
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
So if you're one of these leaders, you're in a leadership position and you think, well, you know,

194
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:52.000
how do I raise my morale of my men? Give them luxury days. Give them feel of on luxury days.

195
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Theo negative not happening. That doesn't do it.

196
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Back to the book. Nor is, no, because I'm sorry because what you have to do is you have to give them challenge. You have to give them discomfort.

197
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Or you're not, not you have to give them. They have to face discomfort.

198
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:16.000
They have to face danger. And that's what increases morale. When they face and they try them over that. That's what increases morale.

199
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Pizza and fine satan sheets do not increase morale.

200
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
They might get a little surface nudge, but they don't increase morale.

201
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Otherwise, your morale would be through the roof.

202
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:40.000
All day. So the morale is so it's like not to be confused because you do need like the rest between sets.

203
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Yes, right. And that's different. And you can't just beat people down.

204
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Right. Right. You can't, you can't, you know, you have to get sleep. You have to get rest. You have to have some level of comfort or your amount of morale will get beat down.

205
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
But that can't be the primary aim. Right.

206
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Right. Right. If you as leaders to provide comfort. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like, hey, let's boost morale by letting people sleep or whatever. Right.

207
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And letting them sleep. But, you know, yeah, give them give them two days off. How about one day off and we come back and trade hard.

208
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Right. Yeah. It seemed like you wouldn't, you wouldn't give them the day off if they don't need the day off.

209
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Like you need the day off or something very specific, like some sort of fatigue situation or whatever.

210
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Bottom line is, is a dichotomy. Right. Can you go too far with comfort and pleasure and leisure? Yes, you can.

211
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Yeah. Can you go too far with discipline and hardness and sternness and scarcity of resources? Yes, you can. You have to find a balance somewhere in the middle.

212
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I think the point here is that people lean towards, well, if I want to increase morale, I just need to give luxury to the troops.

213
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
That's the wrong way to lean.

214
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Actually, lean. I'm not saying go full bore, but you should lean in the direction of hard training discipline. Lean in that direction. Don't go full bore in that direction. Lean in that direction.

215
00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Yeah. It's almost like, I mean, you think, but it seems like making them feel what, like empowered or strong, right?

216
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Let that's kind of the result you're going to. Hey, let me just break it for break it down for you real simple.

217
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
If you go and you have a good training, you just do how do you feel when you're done.

218
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:19.000
How's your morale? Pretty high. Maralas, hi. If you sit there and watch TV all day and you eat a pizza and a donut, how do you feel at the end of the day? How's your morale?

219
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Yeah, be morale, shabby. Now, if you train, you just do nine hours for 14 days straight, how do you feel broken down?

220
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Yeah. Right? And then how do you feel when it's like, hey, man, day off today, echo, all good. Hey, I guess what, I ordered some pizza for you too. It's coming.

221
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
It's going to be your in 15 minutes. We're going to shout out. We're going to watch the fights. Cool. That's good morale boost. We're all good. Yeah. But you got to find that balance.

222
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Yeah.

223
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
All right, back to the book.

224
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Nor is high morale achieved through fitness or healthiness alone.

225
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
It is important not to confuse the idea of physical happiness with morale.

226
00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
The happy faces of men after a good game of football are not necessarily the faces of men with good morale.

227
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Morales, a mental rather than a physical quality, a determination to overcome obstacles and instinct,

228
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
of instinct driving a man forward against his own desires.

229
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Driving a man forward against his own desires.

230
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
That's a good one. That's a good one.

231
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
And he attaches the physical and the mental part a little bit more than I do.

232
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I think they're a little bit more closely related. I think that when you're in good physical shape, it helps your mental morale.

233
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
But he goes on to say this, which is spot on.

234
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
High morale is not happiness.

235
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Happiness may be a contribute to where he factor in the maintenance of morale over a long period,

236
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:51.000
but it is no more than that. A man can be unhappy, but can still regularly and without complaining advance and defend within the terms of the definition.

237
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
So that's an important thing.

238
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And again, this is a trap that leaders get suckered into. Hey, if I can make my people happy, then morale is good.

239
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
No, no.

240
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Pizza will make your people happy, but it won't increase morale.

241
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
It might increase morale if you get it at the right time for the right reason.

242
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Do you eat Hawaiian pizza?

243
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
No.

244
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Check.

245
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Is that just a lie?

246
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Yeah, that's a complete violation.

247
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
We don't even need that kind of pizza in Hawaii.

248
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Generally speaking, he didn't correct.

249
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Well, there you go.

250
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
That's the thing. It's like Canadian bacon.

251
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
What does Hawaiian pizza do to your morale?

252
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Apparently it's inhibitor.

253
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Yeah, it's an inhibitor.

254
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Well, Canadian bacon, yes, like Canadians.

255
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Is this Canadian bacon? It's just a little piece of ham, basically.

256
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Yeah.

257
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
You go, hey, to someone from Canada, be like, hey, this is Canadian bacon.

258
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
The like, no, that's ham.

259
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
You made that up.

260
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Have you ever have an English muffin before?

261
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Yes.

262
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
I mean, England.

263
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Because they don't.

264
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Yeah.

265
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
They just call them.

266
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Just like French fries, right?

267
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Yeah.

268
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Or wait.

269
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
In French, in France, they're called something else though.

270
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
They're not called French fries.

271
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
No, that's England.

272
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
I think they're called French fries.

273
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Yeah.

274
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Yeah.

275
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
That makes sense.

276
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Same deal, then.

277
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
All right.

278
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
This is an important another.

279
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Again, you can see I was in going through this to figure out what I was going to.

280
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
What parts I was going to single out?

281
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
I ended up doing so much of this one.

282
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Yeah.

283
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Because at almost every line is like, yes, you need to know that.

284
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Yes, I need to know that.

285
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I need to remember that.

286
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
So here's one.

287
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Hi, morale is not toughness.

288
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
This one caught me a little off guard.

289
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Some very tough men in this war have turned out to be very disappointing in action.

290
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Toughness is a physical and not a mental asset.

291
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Tough men will occasionally perform an isolated act of bravery.

292
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
So the morale, however, is not a quality which produces a momentary act.

293
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
It influences behavior at all times.

294
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
So that's completely true.

295
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And it's true in combat.

296
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
It's true in training, even.

297
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Like somebody going through what basic seal training there was some tough guys there.

298
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Like tough for you.

299
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Oh, that guy seems like a tough guy.

300
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Quitter.

301
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
And then there's guys that get through buds.

302
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
It's like, oh, they were tough in buds.

303
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Like they did some good job in buds, but it has nothing to do with how well you're going to do as a seal.

304
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Yeah.

305
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Like it does.

306
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
It's, I would say there's some correlation, but it's, it's a very loose correlation.

307
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Being a good seal, buds trainee has very little to do with being a good seal in a seal team.

308
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
And I think that's sometimes surprises people.

309
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
But then again, it's generally surprised people because being a good team.

310
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Because being good at buds, buds is a physical evolution has very little to do with your mentality and has very little to do with leadership and unit cohesion.

311
00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.000
And so to show up at a team, what's the most important thing when you get to a team, the most important thing when you get to a team is to be a team member and be a leader in that team or a follower in that team.

312
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
If you aren't those things, you're not going to be good.

313
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
You can be super tough.

314
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
That's great.

315
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
And there's times when it pays to be tough.

316
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
And you definitely, as a seal, you can't not be.

317
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
You can't not have some level of toughness.

318
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:29.000
You know, when I think about being a seal, there's stuff that you just do on a regular basis that when it's your life.

319
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
When it's just the way your life is, you don't really think about it.

320
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:41.000
But when you take a step back and you think about what you like when I think about my old job, and I'm talking about going back to the 90s, right?

321
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Oh, we're going to go, we have dive week, which is, or dive training.

322
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000
So you go for like four or five weeks of dive training and you're diving two times a day.

323
00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:01.000
It's your wetsuit, your, your, your, your wetsuits wet when you're putting it back on and then you're going to go get an abote and you're going to drive for an hour and a half.

324
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:16.000
An hour and a half up the coast and then you're going to, it's going to be dark and you're going to put on your drag or rebreather and you're going to get in that water again and you're going to kick in the darkness with bio luminescence flying around you for three and a half hours.

325
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000
You're going to get into this random harbor, your freezing cold, you're going to plant all a limpid and fake limpid mind on some.

326
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:37.000
But navy ship somewhere, then you're going to paddle, you're going to swim, fin your way back out. You're going to run out of oxygen, once you run out of oxygen, you're going to come to the surface, and then you're going to swim on the surface for another.

327
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:44.000
48 minutes and then you meet up with that little zodiac boat, you get in, you're freezing, you're exhausted.

328
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.000
And then you drive an hour and 20 minutes to get back to Coronado when you get back, you're going to debrief you're going to get take care of your zodiacs then you're going to take care of your dive rigs then you're going to take.

329
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
You're going to take care of your personal gear, then you're going to take a shower and then you're going to sleep for three hours.

330
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
You're going to wake up with another dive mission tasking, you're going to do the same thing again.

331
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Just cold, wet, miserable.

332
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
That's the life. That's the life.

333
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
So, do you got to have some level of mental toughness?

334
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Sure you do and every seal's got that.

335
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:27.000
But this part talking about like, you know, when you start talking about leadership and being a team player and being a good leader and being a good follower and being smart,

336
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
and tactically sound and being a good decision makers, those are the things that matter.

337
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
When you start talking about the just the idea of being tough, it's like, that's cool.

338
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000
And it's important in everyone in the teams has that or most people in the teams have that baseline.

339
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Because it is a little bit challenging to make it through seal training.

340
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
If you don't at least have some level, it does happen.

341
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
You get some guys who think, man, what happened?

342
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Or you just break down some people have the idea that once they get through seal training, they're done.

343
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
You shouldn't be in seal training to go through seal training.

344
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000
You should be in seal training to get to the seal teams to serve your country, to go into combat, to take the fight to the enemy.

345
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
That's why you join the seal teams.

346
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Not to see how tough you are.

347
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:21.000
So next, in brief, high morale is a quality which is good in itself and is latent in all men.

348
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
It maintains human dignity, in a enables fear and fatigue to be overcome.

349
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
It is involved with the idea of a conscience, but it should be not confused with fitness or happiness or toughness.

350
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
So this goes pretty good lengths to make that distinction, section two basic factors of morale.

351
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
It is now necessary to consider what factors constitute the morale of the soldier in the heat of battle.

352
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Certain factors may be described as essential conditions without which high morale cannot exist.

353
00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:01.000
These four basic factors are one leadership, two discipline, three comradeship, four self-respect.

354
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:08.000
A fifth factor devotion to cause must exist, but need not necessarily influence all of the soldiers.

355
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
There are numerous contributors to our factors which are of great importance but not essential conditions.

356
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
So that's what he's got. The fourth thing is that you have to have in order to have high morale.

357
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Then the first factor of course is leadership which again he's supporting my argument that leadership is the most important thing.

358
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
I don't feel that if you don't have leadership you're not going to have good morale.

359
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Right.

360
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
So right there I already got you beat, Monny.

361
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:38.000
And guess what is second one is discipline, where does that come from? Leadership. What about common ownership?

362
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
That's comes from all these things come from leadership. Anyways, we'll get to that.

363
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Leadership morale is in the first place based on leadership.

364
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Good morale is impossible without good leaders.

365
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
The quality of leadership is one which must be studied.

366
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Human beings are fundamentally alike in that very common characteristics apply to all men in varying degrees.

367
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
And this is what's such a great dichotomy of humans is that all humans are the same and all humans are different.

368
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Right. Like you know it's true.

369
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000
How can that be true? All humans are the same. All humans are different. And that's completely true statement.

370
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:26.000
In battle, the most important of these characteristics is fear. All men are afraid at one time or another and to a greater or lesser extent.

371
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:34.000
In moments of fear, they band together and look for guidance. They seek for a person to give decisions they look for a leader.

372
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
In times of war, the leader has opportunities denied to him in peace.

373
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:48.000
The difficulties, dangers and discomforts inseparable from the battlefield may make men cry out for the leadership they can do without in peace.

374
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.000
At such moments, men are too weak to stand alone. They find the burdens to great to bear and their own selves unequal to the task.

375
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:03.000
The leader himself accepts the burdens of others and by doing so earns their greatest and the right.

376
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Ornth their gratitude and the right to lead them.

377
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Challenging times, things are going sideways. Bad things are happening.

378
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
That's when people are most susceptible to leadership.

379
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
This is completely true. Every routine, a team dynamic where like when everything is going good.

380
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Pretty much like you can, it's going to be hard to tell who the leader is and then all of a sudden something happens.

381
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Something that's chaotic or something that's challenging happens and then you can see that leader just shhh, rise to the top.

382
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
I see that a million times. I see that a million times putting pull-toons through training.

383
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
You kind of not really know what's going on. Who's really, who's really running this boom?

384
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
You start hitting these guys with some downman and some IEDs in the training battlefield.

385
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
You'll see the real leaders will start to step up hopefully.

386
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
I don't know if they don't step up on all.

387
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
But, and this is totally true. You see people want to be led.

388
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
People want to be led. There's going to be some times a little leadership vacuum.

389
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Sometimes you've got to step in and fill that leadership vacuum.

390
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Back to the book, consider a platoon. IED 30 men in action in the line.

391
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
The men are drawn from all classes and all types.

392
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
They are there in the line because they have obeyed a long series of orders,

393
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
which it was easier to obey than to disobey.

394
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
But now the test comes. It is easier for them not to obey orders.

395
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
It is easier for them to stay where they are behind the hill and not advance over the crest

396
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
and to full view of the enemy lies and weight beyond.

397
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:41.000
The dominant motive force, which drives them over the hill, is the leader.

398
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000
It is his quality of leadership above all things, which inspires the men to action.

399
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
This is one of those paints that I'm very clearly when people talk about,

400
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
well, you know, the military even just does what you said because you're in charge.

401
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Try that once everyone is going to die.

402
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Well, once your lives are at stake, people just don't rod your up to say,

403
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
hey, Ecos plans kind of lame to go charge the machine gun nest,

404
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
but you know what he's in charge, so I'm going to go do it.

405
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
No, doesn't work. You have to lead.

406
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
These men recognize in their leaders some quality, which they themselves do not possess.

407
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
That quality is decision.

408
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Fear makes men sluggish and indecisive unable to decide and act for themselves.

409
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:36.000
This is, you know, people talk about being frozen by fear or,

410
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
or have you ever had that thing where you're not quite sure what you're going to do?

411
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Like you, I don't know if I want to do this.

412
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
I don't know if I want to even like something stupid, like not something stupid,

413
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
but you know buying a house, right?

414
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
That's a big purchase you're going to lay down a bunch of money.

415
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
The market could go up or down.

416
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
You're committing to a payment for 30 years.

417
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
There's not so many things in life you commit to for 30 years.

418
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Basically there's only one other one.

419
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
You're getting married, right?

420
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
There's any other commitment that's 30 years.

421
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
I guess you get a tattoo that's a lifetime, right?

422
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
So there's these decisions that you have to make.

423
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
And sometimes we don't, sometimes you see people don't want to make decisions.

424
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Right? They don't want to make a decision.

425
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
What's making them in decisive?

426
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
You think about it, what's making people in decisive is fear.

427
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
They're afraid of what that outcome might bring.

428
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
So if you find yourself being in decisive,

429
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
instead of asking yourself, is this the right decision or wrong decision,

430
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
ask yourself, what am I afraid of?

431
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Hmm.

432
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Back to the book, the leader's power over his men is based on his ability

433
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
and it caught through this fear paralysis and in doing so,

434
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
to enable others to escape from it.

435
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000
The rightness of the decision taken by the leader is irrelevant.

436
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Think about that from the leadership perspective.

437
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
If there's a decision that needs to be made,

438
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
whether you're right or wrong is irrelevant,

439
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
what you need to do is be decisive.

440
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
What matters is that the decision should be taken

441
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
and that the leader should shoulder the responsibility for that decision.

442
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
The leader must convince his men of its rightness,

443
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
even though he himself might be in maybe uncertain of his own judgment.

444
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
If the leader will decide, the men will follow and fight.

445
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
If there is indecision, they will hesitate and flee.

446
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
In short, fight and survive, or fear and be slain.

447
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
The leader decides.

448
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Yeah.

449
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Moving on.

450
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.000
The leader's power of decision results from his ability

451
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
to remain imperpitable in the crisis.

452
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
His calmness prevents panic and his resolution compels action.

453
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
It follows that this.

454
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
It follows from this that the leader must be less fearful than his men.

455
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
He need not be impervious to fear.

456
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Since men require a human figure to lead them,

457
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
what he must do is radiate an atmosphere of confidence

458
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
which will show his men that he is less afraid than they.

459
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
He must have the moral courage to stand firm

460
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
when his men are wavering.

461
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
In this respect, they will judge him by his power of thought

462
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
and action in crisis.

463
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Fear destroys the faculty of thought and paralyzes action.

464
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
The leader must continue to think longer than his men

465
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
and his thoughts must lead to action.

466
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
So there you go.

467
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Don't panic, don't freak out.

468
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
You gotta stay calm.

469
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
And how do you do that?

470
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
You train for it.

471
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
And when you train for it, what do you learn from the training?

472
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
You learn how to do detach.

473
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
That's what you learn how to do.

474
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
That's how you keep your emotions in check.

475
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
You don't let him get a hold of you.

476
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
The leader's greatest asset is the ability to act normally

477
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
in abnormal conditions.

478
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
This is normal face.

479
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
101.

480
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
To continue to think rationally when his men have ceased to think

481
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
to be decisive in action when they are paralyzed by fear.

482
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
So this is a, that section is something you should always

483
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
strive to do from a leadership perspective.

484
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Stay calm.

485
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Don't panic.

486
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Think about what's happening.

487
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
He didn't say it, but I'm going to say it detach mentally.

488
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
So you don't get caught up in the emotion and the fear and the chaos.

489
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Next, the object of training must be firstly to select those

490
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
who possess within them.

491
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
The potentiality of leadership and second to develop these

492
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
potentialities.

493
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
So yes, you've got to look for who's going to be a good leader.

494
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
And then you've got to hone that leader.

495
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
This is accomplished by giving the leader responsibility

496
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
boom, my favorite cure for leadership problems is put people in

497
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
leadership positions.

498
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
A leaders character will develop and proportion to the

499
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
responsibility with which he has been entrusted.

500
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
The more responsibility you put on someone, the more

501
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
responsible they're going to become.

502
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Think about the little kids, right?

503
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Think about a little kid.

504
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
The more responsibility you give a little kid, the more mature

505
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
they're going to be, the more responsibility they're going to take.

506
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
It starts with making your own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

507
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
You should be doing that on your own as soon as it's physically

508
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
possible.

509
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
You're going to make a mask.

510
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
That's what they're going to clean up the mess.

511
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Every time you break down and you make that PB&J for your

512
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
little child, you're taking responsibility away from them and

513
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
you're making them a weaker human being.

514
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
And they feel it.

515
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
And they feel it.

516
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
I made my, she's six, my daughter.

517
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
I made her set the table.

518
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
You know, the old class.

519
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Yeah, yeah, set the table.

520
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
And she knew what it was, but she hadn't really gone through the whole

521
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
deal before.

522
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
So sure enough, she's like, you know, she didn't want to.

523
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
But I'm like, hey, you know, you set the table is what you do.

524
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
You know, you're kind of, you know, this is your job.

525
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
You know, you're going to do the kind of thing.

526
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
So once she set like the first one, yeah, and she did it correctly,

527
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
she was rolling with it.

528
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
It was her table.

529
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
She was like, hey, I'm here.

530
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Boom, she was making decisions.

531
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Taking ownership.

532
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Oh, full of it.

533
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Oh, yeah.

534
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
And you could tell just in her tone kind of like she was super empowered.

535
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Little six year old.

536
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Yeah.

537
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
You know, where, and kind of to look on the whole situation where

538
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
this was someone who didn't want to do it.

539
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
It was a chore.

540
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Yeah.

541
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
You want to do the chore.

542
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
But, you know, you know, you're going to do it.

543
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
You know, you implement it.

544
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
I mean, in my case correctly, you give them ownership.

545
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
That's what you did at contrast.

546
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
You gave your daughter ownership.

547
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
This is your job.

548
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
This is your responsibility.

549
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
You said, you, this is how you do it, but you do it.

550
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
You make it happen.

551
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Yeah, that, and I use that term a lot.

552
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Make it happen.

553
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
And it's weird.

554
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
I don't know if it's what it is about that term with my specific kids.

555
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Because that's what that feels good.

556
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Yeah, like you have influence over this whole situation.

557
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
It's good to think about it when you're, when, as a human being, it's kind of weird that you can make things happen.

558
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
It's good to think straight up.

559
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Right?

560
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Yeah.

561
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
It's a positive thing.

562
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Yeah, and, and yeah, that's a good one.

563
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Making it, making it happen.

564
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Make it happen.

565
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
And you know, like, because, and adults do this too.

566
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
I do this.

567
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
We all do this.

568
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Maybe you don't, I don't know.

569
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
But, you know, how, like, if you say, hey, can you do this?

570
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And then, whether you don't want to or you don't know how to,

571
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
you're just sketch about, you know, the whole thing you ask a lot of questions.

572
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Well, what if this?

573
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
And you know, like, people do that.

574
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
It's almost like they put a bunch of excuses, preloading.

575
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
From, yeah, to indicate, hey, I can't really do this, you know, kind of thing.

576
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
And it's almost like, just, maybe it's like, then being hesitant,

577
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
maybe it's everything, you know, all the same.

578
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
So my kids will do that a lot, you know, like, all but what is, you know,

579
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
all these questions kind of thing indicating, they don't want to do it.

580
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
They want to throw up all this smoke, so you finally just go, hey, I'll do it or whatever.

581
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
And I started saying that.

582
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
I was like, I don't know, make it up and they just do it.

583
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
They just make it happen.

584
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
It's all that I mean, sure, the job won't be the greatest, the first time kind of thing.

585
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
But they have the attitude of just making it happen, you know.

586
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000
You ever, you ever heard like the old guy that's like, when I was your age.

587
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Yeah, sometimes it's me.

588
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Yeah, I was going to say, no, you just made me think that because I do that.

589
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
You know, I'll be like, what, I was your age.

590
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
I wasn't a seal, but you know, you're getting me.

591
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
That doesn't work in my case. Do that ever work for you? Yeah.

592
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
It does. Well, never work.

593
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Because, you know, when one of my older kids that are, you know, my age when I wasn't a seal-up tune,

594
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000
it's like, you know, you're asking me how to do, like, some such simple life thing,

595
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
yeah, or asking me to do it for you.

596
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Yeah.

597
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Like, are you serious right now?

598
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Yeah.

599
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Are you serious right now?

600
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Yeah.

601
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
When I was your age, I was in a seal-up tune.

602
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
I was going on deployment overseas.

603
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
I had guns and radios and encryption devices.

604
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
And you're telling me what, you know, whatever the thing is, you can't make that happen.

605
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Is that where you're at right now?

606
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Yeah.

607
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
And then, could you be what I was your age?

608
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
I always feel like, when my dad or whatever would say that,

609
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
and I feel like if I say it to the my kids, they're going to be thinking like,

610
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Yeah, but it's not cool.

611
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
It's not, it's, I'm actually saying this, putting myself like in a little bit of check.

612
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
It's like, we talked about last time, you know, you can't just be like,

613
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
who, when I was, yeah, no, you need to be, I need to do a better job.

614
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
But it is good.

615
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
The thing is, it is good because the way my, and it'd be usually my older daughter,

616
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
because my older daughter, because she's the one that actually is of age without her was in.

617
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
She actually takes it in a, in a positive way, like,

618
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
she'll have a look on her face like dang.

619
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
I am actually being like really, really dumb right now to be even asking this.

620
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I can obviously figure this thing out, what it does, you know,

621
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
some, you know, the DMV, how do you set an appointment at the DMV?

622
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Are you serious right now?

623
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Are you serious right now?

624
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Make it out.

625
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Yeah, you can't figure that out.

626
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
You could never heard of something called Google.

627
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Yeah.

628
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Think of how easy things are now.

629
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Yeah.

630
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
But you can't even do that?

631
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
No, not happening.

632
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
I was in a, I was in a, I was in a damn seal between when I was your age.

633
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
I think I was responsible for stuff.

634
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
They're telling me you can't figure out how to set an appointment at the DMV.

635
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Are you kidding me?

636
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
This is what I think.

637
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
I did my hypothesis.

638
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Yeah.

639
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
I think that you say enough stuff to your older daughter in this case, where she can relate, where

640
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
it resonate.

641
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
I get where you're saying it just is.

642
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Yes.

643
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000
But I think that once you say what I was your age, I was in a seal platoon.

644
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
She got, she checks out.

645
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
That's what I need to be careful of.

646
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

647
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
That's what I need to be careful of.

648
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
The other thing I'll get from my kids, we just moved here.

649
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
You know, you, you, you know, to be different.

650
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
They kind of, yeah, I'm not, like, well, that's, of course, you did that.

651
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Yeah.

652
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
And I'm like, no, no, you did not true.

653
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Yeah.

654
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
It's not just like, oh, I did that because I'm more square away than you are.

655
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
No, you're actually more capable than I ever was.

656
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Yeah.

657
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
But there's need to step up your game.

658
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
I know, Racy, and this is my whole point.

659
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
The things you're correct with, what you're saying, you're correct.

660
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
But from the kids standpoint, they don't believe that.

661
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Like, from my, if my dad would tell me that kind of stuff, I'd be like, yeah, I,

662
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
I literally think that's because you're you.

663
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Not to say that you're tougher or you're whatever.

664
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
It's like, you're you.

665
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
But right, you're you. You lived in the cave mandates.

666
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Leave me alone about like, figuring, but then if you're like, hey, go,

667
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
make the DMV appointment, go and Google, figure it out, kind of things.

668
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
That, that relates to them.

669
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
It's like, yeah, he's right.

670
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
And then spread it and if she's a grown up, essentially, you know, she's going to

671
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
She's going to read it.

672
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
When my son was like 10 years old, you know, and he might sound

673
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
a good surfer.

674
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
And I was out surfing with him and I was watching him surf.

675
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
And I said, you know, he was patting.

676
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
I just caught a wave like beautiful wave.

677
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000
He's patting out.

678
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
And I said, in a little while, you're going to be a better surfer than I

679
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
What I am.

680
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
And I thought he'd say, oh, that's cool.

681
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
He looked at me like I was completely insane.

682
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Yeah.

683
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
And like I was the craziest, like, it'd be like, he, you could see

684
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
in his eyes.

685
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
He thought that that was not a humanly possible thing that

686
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
would ever happen.

687
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:57.000
I mean, imagine that.

688
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Like, that's the look in his face.

689
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
And he kind of just completely shrugged it off and's like, yeah, right.

690
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Yeah.

691
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
And I mean, six months later, he was better than me.

692
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
And now he's just like infinitely better than me.

693
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Yeah.

694
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
But through your point, when, you know, when you're looking up at

695
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Dad, then sometimes it's this is an unachievable thing.

696
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Yeah.

697
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
And actually, that's not true.

698
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
And the young kids got a recognize that they can outperform

699
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
their lame parents if they put their mind to it.

700
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Yeah.

701
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
And the same thing that happens with subordinates, right?

702
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
You have your subordinate on your team and you think, hey, you have more

703
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
skill than I ever had.

704
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
You have more talent than I ever had.

705
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
If you apply it correctly, you will be able to outperform me

706
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
without question.

707
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
And sometimes people look at you like, oh, you're crazy.

708
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
That could never happen.

709
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
It's like, no, it can happen.

710
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Yeah.

711
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
It can happen.

712
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
But you've got to train.

713
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
That's another thing is people think, oh, well, you just,

714
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
this is natural.

715
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
No, no, no, no.

716
00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Oh, no.

717
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Oh, yeah.

718
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
On the other side.

719
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000
No, I know that's one.

720
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
That's another thing.

721
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Like when I was on with, when we had Captain Plum and Jim

722
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Conkelon, and they were like throwing me in the basket of being like

723
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
them.

724
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Yeah.

725
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
You know, my day guys is all along.

726
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Just check yourselves.

727
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000
I'm 47 years old and I'm barely hanging on to like

728
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
figuring the stuff out.

729
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
I'm not in the, I'm not in the game with you guys in terms of

730
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
figuring out what you all have figured out.

731
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
I mean, those guys are leaps and bounds and in

732
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
iteration upon iteration of knowledge above me.

733
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
And, and I'm just sitting there thinking,

734
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
take it easy, Captain Plum.

735
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Yeah.

736
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
But again, that's just sort of a matter of perspective.

737
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
You know, like that things can seem so much like they can

738
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
seem like a very, something very specific.

739
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
But just because of your perspective, you know, you don't get

740
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
for sure.

741
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
You know, yeah.

742
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
All right, check.

743
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Going back to the book.

744
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000
His position as the man responsible for the lives and

745
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
well-being of his men must be impressed upon him.

746
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
In battle, his preoccupation with his men's affairs will give

747
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
him less time to think of his own fears.

748
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
The mere fact of responsibility will increase the leaders

749
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
and powers of decision and make him confident of his ability to handle

750
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
any crisis.

751
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
So you've got to train people in these challenging situations.

752
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Training must also seek to equip the leader with the other

753
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
qualities which will help him in his task.

754
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Here are those qualities.

755
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
A leader should be efficient.

756
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
He should possess self-confidence.

757
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
He should be firm and just in his dealings with his men.

758
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
He should be clear-cut and definite in giving orders.

759
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
He should pay attention to administrative details.

760
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
He should prepare his men and advance for any new experience they may have

761
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
to meet.

762
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
All these things are important, but they can never be a substitute for.

763
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000
A decision in action and B calmness in crisis.

764
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Yeah.

765
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Stay calm.

766
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Now, one thing that I get a little nervous about talking about

767
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
is the decision in action is sometimes what that means.

768
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
The way that translates to a young, pulled to leader is

769
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
I'm going to make a decision right now.

770
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Hey, everyone, you know, boom, I'm going to jump into it.

771
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
And you can't do that.

772
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
You have to do assessment.

773
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
You have to look at what the situation's going to.

774
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Actually, you've got to have a protocol of how you're going to make those decisions.

775
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
You've got to think about the way it's going to go down.

776
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
You can't just jump at the first thing that pops in your mind.

777
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000
You need to think about it.

778
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
You need to think about the options.

779
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
You need to think about the consequences of those options.

780
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
And then you need to see if you can move in the right direction without full commitment.

781
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Right?

782
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Do you have to occasionally make full commitment on a decision?

783
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Yes.

784
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
If you're, if you got ambushed and you're in the kill zone,

785
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
guess what you're going to have to do.

786
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Assault through the ambush.

787
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
That's what you're going to have to do it.

788
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000
You're going to have to do it decisively and powerfully.

789
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
And with full 100% commitment.

790
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000
But if you take some rounds, but you're not sure if it's an ambush,

791
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
well, you might not want to necessarily assault through that position.

792
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000
So you need to think you need to allow things to develop.

793
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000
So it's a very, it's part of the art of leadership with, with teaching young,

794
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
see a leaders.

795
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Okay.

796
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
You need to let the situation develop.

797
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Here's the problem.

798
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Once the situation starts developing,

799
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
if you let it develop too far, it's got to start a controller.

800
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Right?

801
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
It's, it's a, it's a little, it's a little problem.

802
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Right?

803
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000
When you look at it, then you need to, look at the problem.

804
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Make sure you understand the problem.

805
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Meanwhile, the problem in some cases is growing.

806
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
If you allow the problem to grow too much,

807
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
now you can't control the problem anymore,

808
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
and you're going to get crushed by the problem.

809
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
If you, if you see a small problem and you jump right into solving the problem,

810
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
that might, the problem might have to be what you thought it was.

811
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
And you went out at the wrong direction.

812
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
So there's a fine line.

813
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Like the decision in action is important,

814
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
but thoughtful decision is what it should be.

815
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Thoughtful decision.

816
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
And the reason I keep trying to stress and articulate to people

817
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000
that you don't necessarily need to make a full commitment to a plan.

818
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
You can take them, you can take a smaller step, an iterative step in the right direction.

819
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Before you just jump in.

820
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
So that's just important to think about.

821
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
How does all that compare to making no decision?

822
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Well, making no decisions is the worst thing you can do.

823
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Making no decision standing there and the kill zone getting overrun by the enemy and everyone killed.

824
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
That's the worst thing you can do.

825
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
We want to at least make some kind of a decision.

826
00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.000
So that's why I think he stresses so the importance of decision in action so much

827
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000
is because he's probably seeing people be in decisive and battle and it's a horrible, horrible thing.

828
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
So yes, you want to be decisive, but let's take that one little step further.

829
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
We want to have thoughtful decisions.

830
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Do we want to have a mental 20 minute debate over the decision?

831
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000
No.

832
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000
A thought can take five seconds.

833
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
You can let a situation develop for eight seconds.

834
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000
And you go, wait a second.

835
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000
I think this is what's happening.

836
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Let me confirm to I see anyone over there.

837
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Yep, what the enemy fire is increasing.

838
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
You know what?

839
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000
We need to make this move.

840
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Boom.

841
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
You do it.

842
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000
That's what we're talking about.

843
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Back to the book.

844
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:46.000
These are two vital attributes of a leader with which he will succeed and without which he will fail.

845
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000
These two vital qualities exist in varying degrees in every leader.

846
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Those men who possess them to a limited extent can nevertheless become adequate leaders by being trained in the qualities of the world.

847
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000
They're trained in the qualities already enumerated.

848
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Such leaders must in the first place be efficient.

849
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
This efficiency will impress itself on the men.

850
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:12.000
They're by creating an atmosphere of confidence with which will partially compensate for any lack of personality.

851
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000
By this means training can make men into competent, but not outstanding leaders.

852
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000
There's another aspect of leadership in its relation to morale.

853
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:33.000
The best type of leader earns the respectful admiration of his men because he possesses certain good qualities which they lack.

854
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:41.000
A brutal leader who disregards the feelings of his men will not infuse them with the quality of self-respect.

855
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:47.000
The morale of the troops he commands regardless of his qualities of leader will not be the highest.

856
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000
So even Monty who kind of comes across as being, you know,

857
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
a loof to the troops he's there you go.

858
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000
The brutal leader is not going to have good morale.

859
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Factually.

860
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
An element of self-respect.

861
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Self-respect is a whole section on self-respect that's coming.

862
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Yeah.

863
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:17.000
But yes, if you have a dog and you beat the dog and you're a brutal leader, the dog will not have any self-confidence.

864
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000
It'll be a broken dog.

865
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000
You can do that with human beings too.

866
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000
If you bark at your people and you break them down all the time, they won't be able to stand up.

867
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Another way to do that in a more or should I say less brutal way is to do everything for sure.

868
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Same thing men know.

869
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
You do it yourself.

870
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Yeah.

871
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000
If you're setting the table all the time, your daughter never realizes that she has the capability of doing that.

872
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Yeah.

873
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
She's tying shoes, carrying backpacks, like all that, you know, everything.

874
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000
If you're helping your kids, you're hurting your kids.

875
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Yeah.

876
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Yeah.

877
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
And that clarifies it even more in its culture.

878
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Once you kind of latch onto that idea, you just see it everywhere.

879
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
You ever see these kids, like, I don't know, like a TV show or documentary type,

880
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000
whether in, I don't know, somewhere in Asia or some village where the four year old girl goes and

881
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000
she kills a snake and skins it and then walks like in the mud for another mile back home,

882
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000
cooks it for the family, you know, like, and you're like, dang that cross for.

883
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Yeah.

884
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
And she can do, like, I can't even do that stuff.

885
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
You know, kind of thing.

886
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000
It's like, man, you can't put it into perspective where it's like, these are kids who are just like,

887
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
making it happen.

888
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
You know, beings are so adaptable.

889
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Like, you see the little gymnast kids.

890
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Oh, yeah.

891
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Yeah.

892
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
There's six years old iron cross.

893
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:44.000
There's crazy, dude athletic feats that are just insane.

894
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Yeah.

895
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
And why is that?

896
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Well, because they were put in that position and train hard.

897
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Now, some of those, some of the sometimes let's get straight a little bit too hard.

898
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000
I think they lose, they can lose other aspects of their life.

899
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
But dang, if you wouldn't like to be able to do an iron cross, six years old, come on.

900
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Yeah.

901
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
The point still told you remains.

902
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Yes.

903
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
So let your kids develop and let your subordinates develop.

904
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Give them responsibility, build them up.

905
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Back to the book.

906
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Moreover, it is important to realize that while men are dependent on the word of the leader,

907
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
they are capable of much independent action on their own.

908
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
And are even capable of making their own decisions.

909
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000
So this is kind of, this is kind of funny, right?

910
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000
It's Monti basically saying, look, I got a little surprise for you.

911
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Little surprise.

912
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Your troops can actually think for themselves.

913
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Yeah.

914
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000
You know, imagine that.

915
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Yeah.

916
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Imagine that.

917
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
So obviously this is, this is decentralized command, right?

918
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000
This is it.

919
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
And you have to let your subordinates lead.

920
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000
He goes on to say British soldiers have much native character and individuality.

921
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:52.000
What is required is that the leader shall give the initial and vital decisions along with which the men can work.

922
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000
So yes.

923
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
And you know what?

924
00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
This is actually a glad that Monti said it in that kind of funny way.

925
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
It's the same thing that we're talking about with kids,

926
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000
where you think, oh well, my kids probably not capable of doing that.

927
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Your kid is capable of doing that.

928
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Yeah.

929
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Your kid can go out there and kill a snake and bring it back and skin it and cook it.

930
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Oh yeah.

931
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:21.000
You just have to allow them the the the room to let that happen and give them the authority and power them to do it.

932
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Yeah.

933
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Yeah.

934
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Fully.

935
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
And that yeah.

936
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
So it's a night and day to the other actually last night.

937
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Oh, I was making chicken. Yeah, I make chicken and I usually make rice in Hawaii.

938
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000
You make rice with everything.

939
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Anyway.

940
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000
So I'm like, okay, make the right. I go, hey, I tell my daughter.

941
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
She's six again.

942
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
By the way, I was like, hey, make the rice.

943
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Here's the thing.

944
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000
I showed her how to make rice.

945
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Make rice isn't hard, but it's not like, I mean, in most steps.

946
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Yeah, there's some sense for sure.

947
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000
And it wasn't for me anyway before I taught her how to make rice.

948
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000
It wasn't real obvious that a six year old should be making rice.

949
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
You know, like, not in a rice cooker too, by the way, just like on the stove regular.

950
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.000
But I thought at that point, I was like, hey, why can't I just show her how and teach her how.

951
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Even if I don't teach her in one day, okay, the next time we make rice, which is going to be soon,

952
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.000
I'll go over it again, kind of thing. Why should she not know how to make rice right now?

953
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Why should I have to do this for her?

954
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Whatever. Anyway, I teach her to tell her to make rice.

955
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Super simple.

956
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Boom last night was the first time where it was her responsibility to make rice.

957
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000
She makes rice.

958
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000
She makes rice.

959
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Six years old.

960
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Makes rice.

961
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Boom.

962
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000
She's big.

963
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000
But you know what?

964
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000
No, we're moving in the right direction.

965
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Exactly.

966
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Right.

967
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
So the point is, too, is that you're as a leader.

968
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
As leaders the same thing.

969
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
You're letting your guys run the operation.

970
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Let your troops step up and take control of something that you and your.

971
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Egotistical maniac mind.

972
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Think only your people will think that's what your boys can get it done to.

973
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Yeah. And if they if they bat of 88 instead of 100 cool, next time they're going to get a 92.

974
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
And then I'm after that. They're going to get a 96.

975
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Yeah, because that's a big obstacle too, right?

976
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Mentally.

977
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
It's kind of like sure. I could teach him how to do it.

978
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000
But why would I?

979
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Well, yeah, you see that. You see that even more.

980
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000
See in parenting.

981
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
It's like cool.

982
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000
My kid can make the rice.

983
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Oh, yeah, you're hot.

984
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
We must be.

985
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000
But in in a team environment.

986
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Our ego.

987
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Our ego flares up because we want to be the one, right?

988
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Yes, especially if you can do it at a 10.

989
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Yes, guys only do it at eight at the end of the day.

990
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000
And your job's done.

991
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000
You know what? And you feel.

992
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000
You feel like that's your little power.

993
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
You know, that's my little powers. Like, well, you know,

994
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000
you really don't do that.

995
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
I better come down and check out how you're better.

996
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000
I prep in this stuff because you know,

997
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
yeah, you know, I'm kind of the man.

998
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Yeah, that's where it is.

999
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Yeah, kind of like when you like,

1000
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000
let's say they had to like screw on some stuff or okay.

1001
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Are you so we're going to moving company right?

1002
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
You know this.

1003
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
And at the end, you load up the crates.

1004
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
And the trucking, you have to tie him with a certain kind of knot.

1005
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
Right.

1006
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Learn how to tie that knot.

1007
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000
The kind of the super tight.

1008
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000
But you all you got to do is pull one string to get cool little things.

1009
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
So I learned how, right?

1010
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000
And yeah, I wanted the supervisor or whatever.

1011
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Like yeah, go tie it off or whatever.

1012
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000
And I could totally do it.

1013
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000
We've been doing this for months or whatever.

1014
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
And then he'll go and he'll check it and he'll like,

1015
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
then he'll pull it just a little bit more.

1016
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Yeah, you know, like as it's just like,

1017
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
put a little bit on it.

1018
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
You know, you said, just your from the mass.

1019
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000
You just have to do it right there.

1020
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
But we do that all the time.

1021
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Like, does this we like to have our own little rice balls,

1022
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000
peaking the price, right?

1023
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000
That's a weird term.

1024
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
But you've heard that term before, right?

1025
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Like, hey, you want somebody messing with his rice bowl.

1026
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Meaning like, this is mine.

1027
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Like, oh, I'm the guy that does this part of the job.

1028
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
And I don't want anyone else know how to do it.

1029
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000
That's my little rice bowl.

1030
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Stay out of my rice bowl.

1031
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
There's a lot of rice bowls.

1032
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000
I was never into that.

1033
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Well, at least once I was actually in leadership positions.

1034
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
I was very, I'm not, I don't care.

1035
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Like, oh, you're, you come on.

1036
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Come on and grab some of this rice.

1037
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Because if you can, if you can take my rice bowl from me,

1038
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000
guess what?

1039
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000
I can go find another rice bowl.

1040
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000
I'll bring it in here and we'll start.

1041
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000
We'll have more rice.

1042
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000
It's good, man.

1043
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Yeah.

1044
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Because that's not as intuitive.

1045
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
No, it's not.

1046
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Everyone thinks that everyone thinks that there.

1047
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Everyone leans towards, hey, I want to be the guy.

1048
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Yeah.

1049
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
The ego flares up.

1050
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Back to the book.

1051
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Good morale can be created in a narrow sphere by a good leader.

1052
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:20.000
But a platoon or company is obviously influenced by the general feelings existing in a division or army.

1053
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
So now we're talking to you.

1054
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000
You have multiple layers, multiple layers above the platoon or the company.

1055
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
You've got the army, you know, the division.

1056
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Good morale implies confidence in the high command and in the plan.

1057
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000
And you capitalize the plan.

1058
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000
The plan.

1059
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000
A strong leader on a high level can have a powerful influence on the general attitude to the men of a platoon.

1060
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.000
He cannot however influence their movements over the last flute few vital yards of an attack.

1061
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:53.000
On the other hand, a strong leader on the low level can make his men carry out a single fine attack.

1062
00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:02.000
But he cannot sustain their morale indefinitely if there is a lack of confidence in the high command and its plan.

1063
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
That's a challenge.

1064
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
It's a challenge.

1065
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
If your troops are looking at the strategy going, what the hell are we doing?

1066
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Like you can get the guys through one attack or two or three missions.

1067
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
But eventually they're saying, hey, what's going on? Why are we doing this?

1068
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
This doesn't make any sense.

1069
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And vice versa.

1070
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.000
A leader cannot do without discipline.

1071
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Do you ever think about when I say discipline on the podcast?

1072
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
You should put some little.

1073
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Like a sound.

1074
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Every time I say.

1075
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Especially when I say something like this, a leader cannot do without discipline.

1076
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:50.000
His aim must be to create such a discipline body of men that all his orders will be obeyed instantly.

1077
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:59.000
This habit of obeying the leaders' orders must be so instilled into his men that he will carry on and fight even though he himself falls.

1078
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
There's a problem with for that statement right there.

1079
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Right?

1080
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
The aim, this aim cannot be achieved without discipline.

1081
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
The second factor of morale is discipline.

1082
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
So a couple of things here.

1083
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
First of all, I don't want my team to instantly obey all my orders without question.

1084
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
If I tell them to do something stupid, I actually want them to tell me no.

1085
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000
On top of that, if you think for one minute that all your people do is obey you,

1086
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.000
that when you die, they're just going to suddenly sprout leadership skills and start leading you're wrong.

1087
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:44.000
You have to raise them in a way and treat them in a way that they are being challenged as leaders themselves and they're being allowed to lead in their stepping up and leading.

1088
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And they're not waiting to instantly obey everything you do because if all you're doing is waiting for orders, you're not being proactive, you're not leading.

1089
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Decentralized commanders and happening and if something happens to me, you're going to freeze.

1090
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
So this little section from Monti.

1091
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.000
No, I don't like it. Discipline is something that is important. You have to understand.

1092
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:11.000
You have to have discipline standard operating procedures. You have to have discipline to stay within those procedures.

1093
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:19.000
But on top of that, you have to have the freedom to when those procedures aren't working to say, hey boss, this isn't a good call.

1094
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Here's what we should do instead.

1095
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Now, does this mean you and I are going to have a debate in the middle of a firefight over what the plan is?

1096
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:36.000
No, because we work together, we trust each other. You know what I'm coming from. I know where you're coming from and when I make a call, you're going to do it.

1097
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000
And by the way, if you make a call even though I'm senior to you, if you make a call, guess what I'm going to do.

1098
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Guess what I'm going to do. Follow. Yes, I'm going to follow you.

1099
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.000
If you're like, hey, jackal punch right, get ready to flank these guys and I'm the senior guy, but you just told me to do that.

1100
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Guess what I'm going to do it. I'm going to support you.

1101
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
So that's what you want.

1102
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:06.000
You have to be careful because as people, if you have someone whose personality is sensitive to that, right?

1103
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And you say, hey, jackal, come try and get on their flank.

1104
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And my response is, excuse me a minute, just who do you think you are actually I'm in charge of this platoon. Why don't you just lock it up?

1105
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.000
We're not going to punch right. We're actually going to move, you know what I mean? That's where we can get into that situation all day long. Guess what's going to happen to all of us.

1106
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.000
We're all going to die. So we have to figure that stuff out. We have to figure out that.

1107
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000
That we have to work together, but at the end, one of us has to submit to the situation, submit to the other person's leadership.

1108
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And by the way, there's 16 people in a platoon. In a seal platoon. There's 30 or 40 in a infantry platoon.

1109
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
It's pretty easy to get in the habit of like, hey, when the boss speaks, we're all going to submit to what he's saying.

1110
01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Oh, if the one of my platoon sergeants speaks, okay, well, he barks out something. Guess what? We'll submit to that.

1111
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Occasionally, someone else will rise up and see something.

1112
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:15.000
We have to work and train together so that we know when we need to submit to someone else or when we, or when we need to say, hey, negative.

1113
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
We're not doing that. We're going over here. These are, these are challenging things, right?

1114
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000
It's think of how easy it is to have the Monti attitude and be really easy for me to say right now.

1115
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Like, hey, listen, this is what happens. You'd have to have your men. So discipline when you tell them do something they do it.

1116
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:37.000
That's the easiest solution, right? Oh, okay, great. Joc was put out the word. Oh, by the way, if I get hurt, follow the guy that's in the second chain of command. Okay, cool. That's easy.

1117
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
That's easy day. Right? Now we're going to win every time. No wrong. Because guess what? Occasionally, me, I'm the leader.

1118
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I'm going to make a bad decision. And somebody needs to check me. Now are you going to check me every single time? No, you're not. Are you going to check me?

1119
01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:01.000
You know what? We're going to work together so much that if you think, you know what, I'm not sure Joc was making the right call, but at least I'm going to start to execute it. I'm going to keep a heads up and move forward.

1120
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And then if I see what I think might be a problem happening, I'm going to say something.

1121
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:15.000
But my response out of the gate is we're going to go. That's the kind of thing that's going on here. This is a dynamic environment interacting of human beings. It's freaking challenging.

1122
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Yeah. But to blanket everyone, when I tell you to do something, you do it.

1123
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I want instant obedience to everything that I say.

1124
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Again, that works great, 94% of the time. 6% of the time, it's an auger disaster and everyone dies.

1125
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:41.000
So we don't want to allow for that. We want to allow some flexibility in there. That is harder to do. It's harder to have that flexibility. It's much more challenging.

1126
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
But it gives you such better capability and survivability.

1127
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:56.000
That that's how you want to set it up. It takes a lot more. That's why that's why the more advanced you get in the more tactically advanced you get the more there is of that.

1128
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:06.000
So if you go to a Marine Corps infantry, they're going to have less push back and less. They're going to have more obedience, more just straight road obedience.

1129
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:16.000
As they should, because guess what? In 18 year old Marine doesn't have as much knowledge as a 25 year old staff serge or the platoon commander that went to the basics of going these right.

1130
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000
So there's you're going to have these situations that are going to, so in a normal infantry,

1131
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:31.000
the platoon, there's going to be less push back. You get into a seal platoon. Well, now you've got a bunch of experience guys. Just about everyone here has a few to pull.

1132
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:38.000
So the new guys are going to say anything. But the guys with two or three platoons, they're going to say, hey boss, not a good caller, they're going to give you some push back. Why?

1133
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Because you've got a more experienced field of people. So it takes more practice to get that to get to be able to interact together properly and have that flowing chain of command.

1134
01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:10.000
And also, and can expand and contract and can move from one person to the next dynamically as a mission is happening. I mean, there's times in close quarters combat where basically there's a person at the front of the train and that person rotates out every few seconds.

1135
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:21.000
There's tactical situations where there's a new person making the calls every 10 seconds think about that. That's radical to have a new person making a call every 10 or 15 seconds. There's a new person doing it.

1136
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:28.000
How do you do that? Well, they understand everyone understands, they understand the tactics, they understand how we work together. That's what we want.

1137
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:40.000
As opposed to there's only one person that can make the call. That's just centralized command. So again, it's very, it's hard for me to to throw this out there, right?

1138
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Because I don't want an 18 year old Marine thinking, whoa, you know, I found a like with the platoon commander says, I'm just going to tell him no. Yeah, that's not what I'm saying. Not what I'm saying.

1139
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I do want you to think. I do want you as an 18 year old Marine to think. I want you to be understanding what decisions being made to the best of your ability.

1140
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:07.000
And yes, if you see something happening that is absolutely not good and you know it, your damn right, you should speak up and your platoon commander should be happy that you're speaking up.

1141
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:17.000
But if you're a guy that's going to speak up every time a decision gets made because you think maybe a different way that might be a little bit better in your mind, you're going to suffer the consequences of

1142
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:26.000
number one, the whole platoon being in decisive and number two, your boss is going to tell you to shut up because your idea that might be 8% better than his idea.

1143
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:33.000
We don't have time to discuss that right now. So unless you see something that's real significant, yes, shut up and do what you told.

1144
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:39.000
If you see something that's really significant, okay, hey boss, negative can't do that. There you go.

1145
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:48.000
The second factor discipline. The object of discipline is the is the conquest of fear.

1146
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Press this is new perspective for me that the reason we have discipline is to conquer fear.

1147
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It's interesting, right? Yeah.

1148
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Actually true, too. What is it that gets you to do that thing that you're afraid of? You have the discipline to just drive through it adequately to determine the best method of doing this requires an analysis of fear to be made.

1149
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
There are two aspects of fear. Fear can suddenly attack a man through his imagination.

1150
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000
A corpse in a ditch or a grave by the side of the road will remind him of the peril of his position.

1151
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:30.000
He will suddenly realize that he himself is liable to be killed. It is a function of discipline to fortify the mind.

1152
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000
So that it becomes reconciled to unpleasant sights and accepts them as normal everyday occurrences.

1153
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Fear can also creep in upon a man during periods of monotony in the line.

1154
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
So this is the other type of fear. There's two types, right? The one that just jumps on you.

1155
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And the other one is creeps on you.

1156
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000
At such a time he will have the opportunity to appreciate the dangers which beset his life.

1157
01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Fear acting through his thoughts can so reduce a man's hardcore of courage that he will become nervous and fearful.

1158
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Discipline strengthens the mind so that it becomes impervious to the corroding influence of fear.

1159
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:17.000
He teaches men to confine their thoughts within certain definite limits and instills the habit of self-control.

1160
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Keep your emotions in check, keep your fear in check that requires discipline.

1161
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
The basis of fear is the awareness of danger.

1162
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
In itself this is healthy.

1163
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
For a man who is aware of danger automatically takes steps to provide against it.

1164
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It is only when fear dominates the mind that it becomes unhealthy and leads to panic.

1165
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.000
So fear is good, we know that fear is healthy, we know that until you let it dominate your mind and then it's a problem.

1166
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Men must be urged to fight fear with courage so that they will advance or defend and not take refuge in fight in flight or in action.

1167
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Man becomes aware of danger when he feels himself opposed to something more powerful than himself.

1168
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Right? Man becomes aware of danger when he feels himself opposed to something more powerful than himself.

1169
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
In other words when he feels that his own armament is unequal to that of the enemy who oppose him.

1170
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:27.000
It is important for a man to lose his individual feeling and to become an integral part of the battalion division and army to which he belongs.

1171
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:36.000
The larger the unit of which he feels himself to be a member, the larger will be the estimation of his own armament and the less will be his fear.

1172
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:46.000
It is here that discipline shows its value for it can help a man to lose his own identity and become a part of a larger stronger unit.

1173
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.000
It is in this way that discipline will conquer fear.

1174
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Got a relate to that bigger group.

1175
01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
You see this in like gang fights.

1176
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:08.000
The one person by themselves is a coward but then when they have 10 of their friends all of a sudden they're courageous. It's a horrible example but it's a reality.

1177
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Right? It's a total reality.

1178
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I used to see that in the streets.

1179
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Back in the day. Like one person.

1180
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Right. That's me when I was 15 years old. I'm super tough with all my friends. Right? It's a bad example but it's the reality.

1181
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Yeah, like the big scraps.

1182
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
This corporate sense which discipline creates helps men face the unknown.

1183
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000
At night men in the line become afraid of the unknown which stretches out in front of them.

1184
01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000
At all times in action they are afraid of new and terrifying weapons which may be used against them.

1185
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Realize that these unknown quantities may bring danger to them.

1186
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Their ability to face these dangers is immensely strengthened by feeling themselves to be part of a group.

1187
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:17.000
The group is known and a certain quantity which they feel is strong enough to stand up to the unknown dangers with surround them.

1188
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Strength the numbers.

1189
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:28.000
The method by which the conquest of fear is achieved is the unifying of men into a group or unit under obedience to order.

1190
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
He rolls right back to obedience to orders.

1191
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Monty does.

1192
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
And part of the reason is he's talking about conscripts a lot.

1193
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Drafties.

1194
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
So there's a little bit of a.

1195
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
That's what he's dealing with.

1196
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Now as we know from hack and from general muka yama like, hey, if you treat your people right, doesn't matter that the draft is.

1197
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Men require to be united if they are to give of their best.

1198
01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Discipline seeks to instill into all ranks of sense of unity by compelling them to obey orders as one man.

1199
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
This obedience to orders is the indispensable condition of good discipline.

1200
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Men learn to gain confidence and encouragement from doing the same thing as their fellows.

1201
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
They drive strength and satisfaction from their company.

1202
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Their own identities become merged into the larger stronger identity of the unit.

1203
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
You know what's interesting is I'll go.

1204
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I'll even go a little bit more hardcore against Monty.

1205
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:32.000
You know what to me is an exceptional unit is the unit where you don't even have to give orders.

1206
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Where you just where everyone knows what the intent is or you give them a way of looking like, hey, this is the intent.

1207
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
And people just do what they're supposed to do with no orders.

1208
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Yeah.

1209
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
That's what you really want.

1210
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
You know, there's a.

1211
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000
A chapter that lay fro where he's talking about prioritizing execute.

1212
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000
And he's talking about how it's when one of our guys fell through the roof.

1213
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
They were on a mission.

1214
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
They were in Overwatch.

1215
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
They ended up having to conquer a sledgehammer through a concrete wall.

1216
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
And Lief and I were talking about he's like writing the chapter.

1217
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And he was going to talk about like what his priorities were.

1218
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000
And how he told the guys like, you know, you do this to this and he's like, yeah, well, the thing is I didn't tell anyone to do anything.

1219
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And I was like, yeah, check because his guys knew.

1220
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
But wait, we got this going on. We're going to set security. We're going to move like the everyone knows what's what you want.

1221
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
And then what that allowed Lief to do is I think about, okay, now bigger priorities.

1222
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
And that's what he wrote about.

1223
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:49.000
But your troops, they shouldn't, you shouldn't even have to give them orders because they should be trained well enough to respond based on the situation and knowing and understanding the standard operating procedures and knowing very quickly what it is that your intent is as the leader.

1224
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:54.000
So all you need to say is set security and the guys get into position where they're supposed to go.

1225
01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:09.000
That's how it should be. I'm not looking for, I'm not looking for obedience. You know what I'm looking for? What we used to call thinking shooters, you know, I want to pull too much thinking shooters.

1226
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Meaning that they're thinking for themselves, they're making things happen.

1227
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:21.000
They're understand what it is that I want done, whether I set it to them or whether we pre-briefed it or whether we've been through this, we've drilled it.

1228
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.000
But whatever they know what it is that I want done and I want my team to be thinking, this is decentralized command.

1229
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.000
When you get into just wrote obedience, we're losing the aspect of decentralized command.

1230
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
And as Monty said earlier, believe it or not.

1231
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Your men might be able to make some decisions on their own. It's like, yes, take that many, many steps further than that.

1232
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Check.

1233
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Continue on men must learn to obey orders when all their instincts cry out for them not to be obeyed.

1234
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000
They must learn to obey orders in times of stress so that they will do so in times of danger.

1235
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
They must learn to carry out their tasks under any condition and despite all difficulties.

1236
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:18.000
In this way, the mass of loose individuals with their fears and weaknesses can be welded together into a united hole ready to act on the word of the leaders.

1237
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:30.000
So again, what I'm saying is, I don't want them ready to act on the word of the leader. I want them ready to act on the thought of the leader.

1238
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Discipline helps men to display fortitude in the face of fatigue and discomfort.

1239
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:46.000
While at the same time it helps them conquer fear. It enables them uncomplainingly to triumph over difficulties which would have overcome them in times of peace.

1240
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:53.000
This constant see in enduring hardship and fatigue is the quality which is most frequently required of the soldier.

1241
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Individual fortitude and corporate courage are the twin products of discipline.

1242
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000
So that's the straight positive aspects of discipline that I think of.

1243
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Hey, things are going to be more than an entire one-ever discomfort, whatever.

1244
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Fear, whatever. We have discipline, discipline, conquer all those things.

1245
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Discipline implies a conception of duty. Nothing will be accomplished in the crisis of by man without a sense of duty.

1246
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:34.000
The century in and outpost holds his ground in the face of an attack because he has a sense of duty to those behind him. This sense is instilled by discipline because it teaches men to obey orders as a matter of course

1247
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.000
to know that it is wrong not to obey them and write that it is their duty to do so.

1248
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:53.000
For the soldier, this conception of duty does not embrace abstractions such as freedom or empire or democracy. In battle, a soldier's sense of duty extends only to the friends who are around him.

1249
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It is the job of the junior leader to encourage this sense of duty abstractions are the sphere of a politician.

1250
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:09.000
So he goes real extreme in this one. And we all have heard this before. Hey, when you're in combat, you're not fighting for this political ideology, you're fighting for the man to your left and to your right.

1251
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Absolutely true. Absolutely true. I would say, well, I know that it's not just that you have to, you when the immediate battles over, you need to look and say, okay, well, why are we doing this? Oh, we're doing this because we believe in our cause.

1252
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:41.000
So to me, it's both, you can't just cast out, you know, in my opinion abstractions are the sphere of politicians. No, troops need to believe in what they're doing.

1253
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:49.000
A certain type of training may induce men to go forward and attack simply out of fear of the consequences of not doing so.

1254
01:19:49.000 --> 01:20:02.000
This applies only to the weakest and most feeble of men who are of little value in battle. This type of training is an essential part of discipline, but it's never be missed to be mistaken for the whole. So he kind of goes one way and then the other.

1255
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
It's like, yeah, sometimes you're just going to have to.

1256
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:12.000
You have to make people do what you want to do because they're afraid of you or they're afraid of the consequences. If you have to lead through fear.

1257
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:19.000
If you, if you, if you're, if your team is doing something only because they're afraid of the consequences, that's a losing battle.

1258
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Well, it's a losing war, right? You might win the battle, but you're not going to win the war. Continuing on, the type of training mentioned in the preceding paragraph, which implies a certain harshness and hardness has its value.

1259
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:47.000
The material comforts are now so incidious that there's some danger that this is the old fashioned idea of discipline. And it will be allowed to disappear. This must not happen.

1260
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Soldiers will not win battles if their training is not been hard.

1261
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
That's a little less than for your entire life.

1262
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Soldiers will not win battles if their training is not been hard.

1263
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
The softening influences of civilian life must be replaced by the exacting demands of military training.

1264
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Soldiers must forget the pleasures of peace and concentrate on the realities of war.

1265
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Isn't it funny that this, this could be written right now and some of the cool, you know, training is getting easier and all that.

1266
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:27.000
It's like, we always think that got to keep it hard. You always got to fight against the slippery slope of things getting easier.

1267
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:37.000
In brief, discipline seeks to conquer fear by welding men into a cohesive whole unit united by obedience to orders.

1268
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Yeah.

1269
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
No, I'm not with you, money.

1270
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:48.000
It aims to create a body strong enough to carry each of its members through dangers and difficulties which they themselves would be unable to face alone.

1271
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
In this way, it promotes comradeship, which is the third factor of morale.

1272
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Okay, I much more important in my opinion than the blind obedience of orders morale.

1273
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
So we're talking about comradeship now.

1274
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Moral cannot be good unless men have come unless men come to have affection for each other.

1275
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000
A fellow feeling must grow up which will result in a spirit of comradeship.

1276
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
An army is made up of human beings.

1277
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:25.000
So that however much a leader may inspire his man, however perfect the discipline morale will be hard and unsypathetic.

1278
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
If the warmth of comradeship is not added to it.

1279
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:39.000
War, the hard business is not necessarily a grim one. Men must laugh and joke together must enjoy each other's company and must get fun out of life even in times of danger.

1280
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Check this spirit of comradeship must begin at the section or tank crew level and work its way upward to army level.

1281
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:56.000
The importance of encouraging men to band together and identify themselves with their units has already been emphasized.

1282
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:04.000
This will be necessary to make considerable efforts to further this spirit of comradeship.

1283
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Junior commanders must plan to create this spirit in the same way they plan to train their men and fire their weapons.

1284
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Men must not be moved from unit to unit or even from platoon to platoon unless there's good reason for doing it.

1285
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
And these reasons must be made clear to the men.

1286
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.000
A man who has served among friends in the same platoon for a long time will be helped by them to face the trials of battle.

1287
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.000
He will feel around him, his reserves of courage and purpose upon which he can draw.

1288
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:40.000
There will be a feeling of solidarity and out of this feeling there will grow up a determination to advance together and defend together and even die together.

1289
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:58.000
In wartime with such heavy casualties and constant reinforcements it is always found that this comradeship can be built up most quickly by ensuring that new arrivals has reinforcements belong to the part of Britain from which the unit is originally drawn and to which it belongs in peace time.

1290
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:11.000
That's what you've got to have your team join together and then he's saying, look if you've got new reinforcements coming in and they came from Darbyshire and there's a unit from Darbyshire, send them to go work with the guys from Darbyshire.

1291
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
They already have a connection.

1292
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:34.000
The comradeship is, and you know who didn't do that, the Soviets, the Soviet Union was famous for not doing that because they didn't want there to be a really strong unity in the forces because then that unity might turn into a movement.

1293
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:44.000
They didn't want that they would notoriously split everyone up. You would never be with a guy from your hometown. They'd split everyone up. This is the opposite of that.

1294
01:24:44.000 --> 01:25:03.000
This is based on affection and trust which between them produced and atmosphere of mutual goodwill and feeling of interdependence. Men learn to have faith in each other and to depend on each other according to the abilities of each and a tank crew, gun team or infantry section, men do not work well together, merely because they are disciplined and well led.

1295
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:13.000
They do so because they trust each other and because they are bound together by an affection which is never expressed in words, but shown itself indeed.

1296
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Comradeship is a great antidote to fear because it gives a man friends. A man must take friends, a man must make friends in his platoon, friends whom he respects and admires.

1297
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:31.000
In battle these friends will prevent him from feeling lonely. A man alone is a man who will find it hard to stand up to the dangers of the line.

1298
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:44.000
A man alone is a man afraid. If he has friends he will derive strength from their presence and he will be anxious not to let them down in battle.

1299
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:59.000
You will seek to do his fair share of all tasks which come to his crew or section he will feel ashamed if he cannot assist his friends in their duties and maintain his place with them in the line.

1300
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Within them a touch of streak of generosity and unselfishness, a touch of nobility and these qualities will be brought out in the attitude to their friends. Friendship causes men to give their best.

1301
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I guess we started talking about this a little bit in the beginning. If you are not, if you don't want to be a part of the team, you are going to miss this whole section of what makes a unit to have high morale.

1302
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:44.000
If we are not friends that hurts our morale. They have these things and the rangers do a really good job of it. You can pier someone out.

1303
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Meaning we as peers can look at someone that we don't like or that doesn't want to be a part of the team and we can get rid of them.

1304
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:05.000
If you are not a part of the team, you can do it. It is a little bit case by case.

1305
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:34.000
If you are not a part of the team, you can do it.

1306
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:44.000
If you are not going to be a part of the team, you can do it.

1307
01:27:44.000 --> 01:28:00.000
If none of us like echo, it is just to put echo at the bottom, three patrols in the row and you are gone. In the basic seal training, we don't really have a system like that. It takes a little bit more. You have to be a little bit more proactive because it is not just an existing thing.

1308
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:15.000
We did have my seal training class. We had one guy that we peered out. My officers got feedback from everyone and said this guy shouldn't be here.

1309
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:39.000
It was not a part of the team. It was not a part of the team.

1310
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:49.000
It was a part of the team. It was a part of the team.

1311
01:28:49.000 --> 01:29:11.000
It seems like you could do that with a roommate situation.

1312
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:21.000
It was a part of the team.

1313
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:46.000

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000
It was a part of the team.

1372
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:40.000
It was a part of the team.

1373
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:50.000
It was a part of the team.

1374
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.000
It was a part of the team.

1375
01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:04.000
It was a part of the team.

1376
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:14.000
It was a part of the team.

1377
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.000
It was a part of the team.

1378
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:26.000
It was a part of the team.

1379
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:51.000
It was a part of the team.

1380
01:45:51.000 --> 01:46:05.000
It was a part of the team.

1381
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:11.000
It was a part of the team.

1382
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:16.000
It was a part of the team.

1383
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:24.000
It was a part of the team.

1384
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:45.000
It was a part of the team.

1385
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.24
And so when is the matter just fighting because they're ordered to he literally says that I come on bro

1386
01:46:49.56 --> 01:46:55.82
That's not that that doesn't work that doesn't work in America and in you know you talk like look at that

1387
01:46:55.82 --> 01:47:00.72
That letter I read from the beginning. That's kind of why I wanted to read that letter as a con as a

1388
01:47:01.22 --> 01:47:06.000
Contradiction to this and as an I mean what he says in that letter is

1389
01:47:06.40 --> 01:47:12.70
Like look I'm not fighting for the great of England. He says that but he's fighting for the cause of security for his family

1390
01:47:12.90 --> 01:47:14.90
right so

1391
01:47:14.90 --> 01:47:18.10
People are thinking about that you don't you don't you don't

1392
01:47:19.26 --> 01:47:27.88
Say I'm willing to die just because some random dude ordered me to do it. No you have to have a connection to something greater than that

1393
01:47:27.88 --> 01:47:30.90
Otherwise you're you're suicidal right?

1394
01:47:30.90 --> 01:47:31.90
Yeah

1395
01:47:31.90 --> 01:47:36.24
Yeah, remember saving private Ryan. Yes, he said there's a movie. Yes

1396
01:47:37.52 --> 01:47:43.78
Tell me, he's right. He's like I don't know who Ryan. You know they got a safe private Ryan

1397
01:47:43.78 --> 01:47:47.14
Obviously and they're at this part

1398
01:47:47.78 --> 01:47:52.66
Where they're kind of questioning things you know guys, you know morale is breaking down

1399
01:47:53.94 --> 01:48:00.34
And you know things happen and what he says in part of his speech was like hey, I don't know who private Ryan is. I don't know him

1400
01:48:01.26 --> 01:48:03.26
So I basically questioning that

1401
01:48:03.90 --> 01:48:10.78
Particular cause but he said but if going and rescuing him earns me the right to get back to my family then that's my mission

1402
01:48:10.78 --> 01:48:17.58
So same deal same deal is the letter at that cost. Yes. He had his caught. Oh, yeah, and now is the one he was fighting for

1403
01:48:18.70 --> 01:48:20.70
here

1404
01:48:20.98 --> 01:48:28.54
Back to the book nevertheless nothing which has been stated here must be interpreted as minimizing the influence of cause on those officers and men who are moved by it

1405
01:48:28.54 --> 01:48:32.86
So then he he brings it back a little bit for these few cause will be a

1406
01:48:33.22 --> 01:48:38.46
sustaining and strengthening factor and maybe of greater importance to them than any of the other four factors

1407
01:48:38.46 --> 01:48:44.66
There are times when a few men will be gripped by a cause and will perform astonishing deeds of heroism to further it

1408
01:48:44.66 --> 01:48:53.46
Such men do not require the ordinary bonds of discipline which unite and strengthen others their devotion to the cause is in itself all sufficient

1409
01:48:54.26 --> 01:48:59.46
Nor do they require the same kind of leader that has been described name themselves will all be leaders

1410
01:49:00.06 --> 01:49:02.74
Such men may be properly described as

1411
01:49:02.74 --> 01:49:09.02
Gorilla or irregular fort fighters fanatically devoted to a political religious or national ideal

1412
01:49:09.26 --> 01:49:14.86
They must not be confused with conscript soldiers to whom this paper applies

1413
01:49:16.30 --> 01:49:20.50
So there you go. I mean in America, you know, we have all volunteer

1414
01:49:21.22 --> 01:49:28.58
But I'm telling you even it doesn't matter if you've got it you people have to understand there has to be some kind of a deeper causes to what you're doing

1415
01:49:28.58 --> 01:49:35.38
Or else you're gonna have real problems sure you can order people if they're constrips and you can punish them if they don't do you what you're gonna tell if they don't do

1416
01:49:35.38 --> 01:49:39.10
What you tell them to do you can punish them that is a way

1417
01:49:40.22 --> 01:49:47.30
But that is not going to be a successful way, you know, that is not gonna be the ideal way and by the way

1418
01:49:48.18 --> 01:49:51.70
If you're not using the ideal way you may win

1419
01:49:51.70 --> 01:49:57.80
But if you're going you can somebody that is using the ideal way that has a cause that they believe in and on top of that

1420
01:49:57.80 --> 01:50:03.16
Cause they have all these other things that the group that has a real cause will win every single time

1421
01:50:06.56 --> 01:50:12.68
Now there's some other contributory factors that he brings up here one is success. This is a real

1422
01:50:13.68 --> 01:50:18.88
obvious one success. Hymeralaz is possible in defeat, but not during a long period of defeat

1423
01:50:18.88 --> 01:50:25.52
On such occasions confidence and leaders will never be wane and the first basis will be undermined success

1424
01:50:25.52 --> 01:50:32.20
Will aid good morale by creating confidence in the leader and in the command this factor requires no enlargement

1425
01:50:34.60 --> 01:50:36.92
Next one is regimental tradition

1426
01:50:37.24 --> 01:50:40.96
Regimental spirit can be a powerful factor in making for a good morale

1427
01:50:41.60 --> 01:50:49.28
The more a soldier feels himself to be identified with his regiment the higher will be his morale if the four essential conditions have been fulfilled

1428
01:50:49.52 --> 01:50:51.52
It must be realized however

1429
01:50:51.52 --> 01:50:57.16
That not only that there can be a good morale without strong regimental feelings

1430
01:50:57.28 --> 01:51:03.78
But that regiments with great tradition do not necessarily always produce good battalions

1431
01:51:04.96 --> 01:51:11.12
So the tradition which there's some units that have awesome traditions and

1432
01:51:11.12 --> 01:51:20.72
You know being with some of those some of those units overseas. I mean the first the 506 obviously comes to comes to light and their

1433
01:51:22.44 --> 01:51:26.64
Their tradition the hundred and first everyone tradition was so thick

1434
01:51:27.40 --> 01:51:31.58
There's that pride was in every soldier that that war that

1435
01:51:32.36 --> 01:51:38.48
That ace of spades that that spade on their gear was like yeah, there's pride there. There's tradition

1436
01:51:38.48 --> 01:51:46.72
But he's saying it's not gonna replace these other things, but it is a factor that you can use another factor

1437
01:51:48.08 --> 01:51:50.08
Again contribute to a factor

1438
01:51:51.52 --> 01:51:53.52
Personal happiness

1439
01:51:55.28 --> 01:51:58.96
A man should be happy in the sense that his personal life should be in order

1440
01:52:00.40 --> 01:52:03.000
Nothing weakens a man more than trouble at home

1441
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.28
It encourages it encourages him to think of home and all that it implies when he should be occupied with the enemy

1442
01:52:10.68 --> 01:52:17.80
It turns his mind to peace and his desire to live at the moment when it is necessary for him to steal himself to face the

1443
01:52:17.96 --> 01:52:26.000
Possibility of death. He must never be allowed to forget that it is his job to fight the function is to kill the enemy and in doing so

1444
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
He must expose himself to danger

1445
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:35.16
Anything which weakens his will to fight and expose himself must be considered to lower his morale

1446
01:52:35.68 --> 01:52:44.16
A soldier is only a family man after he is a soldier. He must look forward at the enemy and not back towards home

1447
01:52:49.28 --> 01:52:51.60
Some realism to that definitely

1448
01:52:51.60 --> 01:52:58.16
I think it can go either way. I think there's times where people can be driven

1449
01:52:58.96 --> 01:53:02.08
to success by their family back home

1450
01:53:02.08 --> 01:53:04.88
I think in their family, but it can definitely become a distraction

1451
01:53:05.12 --> 01:53:10.56
Yeah, it's a situation. Yeah, it seems like when there's a lot of risk involved it'll be a description is a

1452
01:53:10.96 --> 01:53:12.96
Destruction

1453
01:53:13.84 --> 01:53:15.44
Maybe

1454
01:53:15.44 --> 01:53:18.16
I think it depends on the individual like it depends on the circumstances

1455
01:53:18.16 --> 01:53:20.16
I think

1456
01:53:20.16 --> 01:53:25.52
What may be better to look whether it's a distraction on is it like what's going on at home?

1457
01:53:25.52 --> 01:53:28.08
That's what's more important if there's disruption at home

1458
01:53:28.64 --> 01:53:29.60
That's a problem

1459
01:53:29.60 --> 01:53:34.72
Right if you got a guy that's overseas and there's problems in the family life

1460
01:53:35.36 --> 01:53:37.36
That's what that's gonna hurt. Yeah

1461
01:53:38.32 --> 01:53:42.16
Yeah, it's weird because like you know guys that work sometimes anyway

1462
01:53:43.92 --> 01:53:45.92
Sometimes

1463
01:53:45.92 --> 01:53:50.000
You know they is something back can be going on at home. Yeah, they'll use work to sort of

1464
01:53:50.64 --> 01:53:54.24
Cover it up like playing in their mind. You know there'll be like hey that like

1465
01:53:55.12 --> 01:53:59.44
Again, I'm sorry for another movie reference, but there's something called true lies Arnold's

1466
01:53:59.44 --> 01:54:00.72
We're today. I've seen those

1467
01:54:00.80 --> 01:54:06.96
He goes yeah, so Arnold I haven't seen it enough times it came out 20 years ago to be pulling our quote

1468
01:54:07.52 --> 01:54:11.76
And story line, but hey, let's go with it. It's kind of he said the point of this one but he goes

1469
01:54:11.76 --> 01:54:16.80
Uh, you know Arnold finds out that his wife is or thinks that is why she's cheating on him with it

1470
01:54:16.80 --> 01:54:18.80
Like and then the partner

1471
01:54:19.20 --> 01:54:25.52
Tom Arnold goes he's all let's just focus on work. That's what I'll that's what I always do when my life turns to dog shit

1472
01:54:25.52 --> 01:54:30.96
I just focus on work. Yeah, you know well, but and the the point is like some people that's how you know

1473
01:54:30.96 --> 01:54:35.04
Something's going wrong at home. No, but like you know, I'm just focused on work screw that that's forget about it

1474
01:54:35.04 --> 01:54:38.72
You know, I'm immersed myself. Yeah, because I think you can control work. Yeah

1475
01:54:38.72 --> 01:54:43.52
You might not be able to control your relationship the way you think you should be able to yeah, huh? So

1476
01:54:45.12 --> 01:54:49.20
Continuing on all soldiers do not have morale affected by home troubles

1477
01:54:49.84 --> 01:54:55.84
Some men thrive on unhappiness and fight all the more fiercely because they hold a bitter a secret bitterness with that

1478
01:54:55.84 --> 01:54:56.64
them

1479
01:54:56.64 --> 01:54:59.60
Such men are the minority that's the person you just talked about right?

1480
01:54:59.60 --> 01:55:05.12
Hey, I was gonna go work harder, but it's such men are the minority, but they are a large minority

1481
01:55:05.12 --> 01:55:09.52
They are a reminder that happiness cannot buy itself produce good morale

1482
01:55:10.88 --> 01:55:17.04
Next is administration of men's ordinary day-to-day life must be well organized thus hard conditions imposed on him

1483
01:55:17.04 --> 01:55:22.72
Intraining to inculcate discipline do not rule out the desire ability of good living quarters and

1484
01:55:23.44 --> 01:55:28.16
In the line a soldiers morale will be much improved if the administration

1485
01:55:28.40 --> 01:55:34.56
Administrative arrangements are good and if he is assured of proper conditions with a reasonable amount of

1486
01:55:34.56 --> 01:55:37.12
Leisure and comfort when he leaves the front

1487
01:55:38.72 --> 01:55:40.72
Leisure day

1488
01:55:40.72 --> 01:55:42.72
Were you at

1489
01:55:42.96 --> 01:55:48.08
Were you at the o'von and then he says this but here a warning must be given

1490
01:55:49.52 --> 01:55:57.76
There is a danger today of welfare being considered as an end in itself and not as a means to an end

1491
01:55:57.76 --> 01:56:06.72
One of the means of maintaining morale welfare by itself will not produce good morale because it is essentially soft

1492
01:56:07.84 --> 01:56:13.28
And it has already been stating that morale cannot be good unless it contains a quality of hardness

1493
01:56:14.40 --> 01:56:15.60
You

1494
01:56:15.60 --> 01:56:24.96
Man you gotta remember that right you gotta remember that you're not ever gonna have good morale unless there's like an element of hardness to it

1495
01:56:24.96 --> 01:56:26.96
and

1496
01:56:27.68 --> 01:56:32.80
Continuing on hardship and privation are the school of the good soldier

1497
01:56:35.76 --> 01:56:38.24
Idleness and luxury are his enemies

1498
01:56:39.84 --> 01:56:45.12
Men will endure great hardships if they know why and are convinced of the necessity

1499
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.72
Blood toil tears and sweat is not for nothing

1500
01:56:48.72 --> 01:56:56.80
One of the great rallying calls of the English race gorgings cry guns before butter expressed the same truth

1501
01:56:57.04 --> 01:56:58.64
if men believe in the need

1502
01:56:59.52 --> 01:57:01.52
hardships are in themselves

1503
01:57:01.76 --> 01:57:11.20
Stimulate to morale but the opposite is also true let there be any suggestion that butter can come before guns and the men will at once choose butter

1504
01:57:12.40 --> 01:57:16.24
If this happens there will be no morale in this sense of the definition

1505
01:57:16.24 --> 01:57:23.84
Then we get propaganda the uplifting effect of modern propaganda on a soldier is

1506
01:57:24.40 --> 01:57:26.40
Perhaps a new development

1507
01:57:26.40 --> 01:57:37.44
A man's morale is raised immensely by the feeling that his efforts are appreciated and applauded not only by his comrades and his officers but also the world at

1508
01:57:37.84 --> 01:57:41.44
Large you gotta you gotta get that propaganda working for you

1509
01:57:41.44 --> 01:57:49.60
I've had a couple companies I've been working with lately and one of them was being assaulted

1510
01:57:50.72 --> 01:57:52.40
by

1511
01:57:52.40 --> 01:57:54.40
It's competitors and

1512
01:57:54.40 --> 01:57:56.40
It had a better product

1513
01:57:56.40 --> 01:58:02.64
It's product was doing well, but they were getting assaulted and they were getting assaulted by the way with lies

1514
01:58:03.84 --> 01:58:08.08
Like the competitors are just making stuff up right making stuff up put that word out there

1515
01:58:08.08 --> 01:58:15.04
Roomers on officially and you know here's the thing the CEO was kind of

1516
01:58:16.16 --> 01:58:23.60
Did most of what you're what to do and I said you have the most how the most powerful tool in your arsenal

1517
01:58:24.80 --> 01:58:26.32
It's the truth

1518
01:58:26.32 --> 01:58:32.56
But you gotta weaponize that truth you gotta weaponize it you gotta turn it into a weapon that you can use to crush the lies

1519
01:58:32.96 --> 01:58:36.88
Because if you're doing great things and you're not telling anyone you're not putting out any propaganda

1520
01:58:36.88 --> 01:58:43.04
Well, and guess what no one's gonna know about it. You just lost your your most valuable weapon which is the truth

1521
01:58:43.28 --> 01:58:48.24
If you're doing good things and your product is better and you can prove that it's better and people know that it's better

1522
01:58:48.24 --> 01:58:54.16
But you're not telling anyone you're gonna you it doesn't matter if the weaponize that truth and get it out there

1523
01:58:54.40 --> 01:58:56.40
So that's what propaganda is

1524
01:58:59.68 --> 01:59:02.96
Now we are moving into the conclusion right here

1525
01:59:02.96 --> 01:59:05.84
In brief

1526
01:59:05.84 --> 01:59:12.40
Hi morale has been defined as the quality which makes men in dirt and show courage in times of fatigue and danger

1527
01:59:12.64 --> 01:59:18.80
The cultivation of morale depends upon the training of leaders the inculcation of discipline

1528
01:59:18.80 --> 01:59:25.04
The encouragement of comradeship and the infusing of self respect the leaders must have a belief in their cause

1529
01:59:25.04 --> 01:59:34.000
And they must pay attention to numerous contributory factors of considerable but secondary importance and here's how we close it out

1530
01:59:34.40 --> 01:59:36.88
Man is still the first weapon of war

1531
01:59:38.24 --> 01:59:43.12
His training is the most important consideration in the fashioning of a fighting army

1532
01:59:44.56 --> 01:59:51.52
All modern science is directed toward his assistance, but on his efforts depend the outcome of the battle

1533
01:59:51.52 --> 01:59:59.92
The morale of the soldier is the most important single factor in war

1534
02:00:01.60 --> 02:00:08.40
So there he is saying it again the morale of the soldier is the most important single factor in war and as I said I will argue with that

1535
02:00:09.84 --> 02:00:14.72
Because as far as I'm concerned without question leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield and I'm actually like I said

1536
02:00:14.72 --> 02:00:16.72
I'm thinking I'm right

1537
02:00:16.72 --> 02:00:19.76
So no offense to Monty, but I think I'm right because

1538
02:00:19.76 --> 02:00:23.28
If he's his factors to review them leadership

1539
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.84
That's the number one factor. Well, that's leadership

1540
02:00:27.04 --> 02:00:28.72
Discipline where does that come from

1541
02:00:29.12 --> 02:00:30.84
Discipline comes from leadership?

1542
02:00:30.96 --> 02:00:32.72
Kamradi Ship where does that come from?

1543
02:00:33.28 --> 02:00:34.64
it comes from good leadership

1544
02:00:34.84 --> 02:00:37.66
Self respect where does that come from in this I'm not

1545
02:00:37.66 --> 02:00:41.44
I'm not saying that this is what Monty saying Monty said that discipline comes from leadership

1546
02:00:41.76 --> 02:00:46.96
Monty said that Kamradi ship comes from leadership Monty said that self respect comes from leadership

1547
02:00:46.96 --> 02:00:50.58
So as far as I'm concerned, no offense,

1548
02:00:50.58 --> 02:00:53.82
it's far as I'm concerned, leadership is the most important thing

1549
02:00:53.82 --> 02:00:56.98
on the battlefield, but that being said,

1550
02:00:56.98 --> 02:01:00.06
let there be no doubt that morale without question

1551
02:01:00.06 --> 02:01:03.98
is necessity and a requirement for victory.

1552
02:01:03.98 --> 02:01:05.76
And I will add this.

1553
02:01:07.52 --> 02:01:09.26
morale is important.

1554
02:01:10.40 --> 02:01:13.62
Extremely important, not only for a team,

1555
02:01:13.62 --> 02:01:16.82
not only for a military unit or a business

1556
02:01:16.82 --> 02:01:19.46
or any kind of organization made up of people,

1557
02:01:19.46 --> 02:01:24.46
but morale is also important for individuals.

1558
02:01:27.18 --> 02:01:32.18
For us day to day, how is your morale?

1559
02:01:32.18 --> 02:01:33.86
Where's your morale at?

1560
02:01:33.86 --> 02:01:35.34
Think about how you approach the day

1561
02:01:35.34 --> 02:01:36.58
when your morale is good.

1562
02:01:36.58 --> 02:01:39.38
Think about how you go into the day.

1563
02:01:39.38 --> 02:01:40.66
Just like you're going into attack.

1564
02:01:40.66 --> 02:01:42.26
If you're going to attack the enemy

1565
02:01:42.26 --> 02:01:44.18
and your morale is high,

1566
02:01:44.18 --> 02:01:45.82
you're going to attack with vigor.

1567
02:01:45.82 --> 02:01:47.46
And you're probably going to be successful.

1568
02:01:47.46 --> 02:01:49.74
If you go in to attack the enemy

1569
02:01:49.74 --> 02:01:51.14
and your morale is low,

1570
02:01:51.14 --> 02:01:53.10
you're going to attack without vigor,

1571
02:01:53.10 --> 02:01:54.38
without enthusiasm.

1572
02:01:55.50 --> 02:01:57.02
And you're probably going to fail.

1573
02:01:57.02 --> 02:01:59.46
Well, what about you as a person?

1574
02:01:59.46 --> 02:02:02.10
If your morale is low, guess what?

1575
02:02:02.10 --> 02:02:03.78
If you roll into the day,

1576
02:02:03.78 --> 02:02:05.66
you roll into your mission,

1577
02:02:05.66 --> 02:02:07.22
and your morale is low,

1578
02:02:07.22 --> 02:02:09.18
likely you are going to fail.

1579
02:02:09.18 --> 02:02:12.70
So then the question is,

1580
02:02:12.70 --> 02:02:15.86
how do we increase our personal,

1581
02:02:15.86 --> 02:02:17.46
individual morale?

1582
02:02:17.46 --> 02:02:20.46
And I think it's the same way we improve team morale.

1583
02:02:22.14 --> 02:02:26.54
We improve our personal morale with discipline,

1584
02:02:28.66 --> 02:02:31.82
with hardship and with privation

1585
02:02:31.82 --> 02:02:35.10
and with efficiency and with emotional control

1586
02:02:35.10 --> 02:02:37.78
and by facing our fears and, of course,

1587
02:02:37.78 --> 02:02:40.78
most important is leadership.

1588
02:02:43.66 --> 02:02:46.54
Leadership leading yourself and not allowing

1589
02:02:46.54 --> 02:02:49.58
this leadership vacuum in your head,

1590
02:02:51.70 --> 02:02:54.34
right when I was putting seals through training,

1591
02:02:54.34 --> 02:02:55.70
parking the day.

1592
02:02:55.70 --> 02:02:57.34
If there was chaos broke out,

1593
02:02:57.34 --> 02:02:59.30
there were sometimes where no leader would step up

1594
02:02:59.30 --> 02:03:02.22
and take charge and that would create a leadership vacuum.

1595
02:03:02.22 --> 02:03:03.70
And it was hard to tell what was happening

1596
02:03:03.70 --> 02:03:05.98
because no one would be saying anything.

1597
02:03:05.98 --> 02:03:09.42
It would just be silence and you didn't hear anything.

1598
02:03:09.42 --> 02:03:11.70
And so it's hard to recognize that all of a sudden,

1599
02:03:11.70 --> 02:03:13.14
wait a second, there's no one's leading.

1600
02:03:13.14 --> 02:03:14.86
You don't recognize it because it's not happening.

1601
02:03:14.86 --> 02:03:16.54
It's like seeing something that's not there.

1602
02:03:16.54 --> 02:03:18.26
It's not there, so you don't think about it.

1603
02:03:18.26 --> 02:03:19.38
Well, no one's leading.

1604
02:03:19.38 --> 02:03:22.30
Take sometimes it can be hard to notice that.

1605
02:03:22.30 --> 02:03:23.66
And I'd call that a leadership vacuum

1606
02:03:23.66 --> 02:03:24.78
and I teach these young seals like,

1607
02:03:24.78 --> 02:03:26.82
hey, when that happens, you need to step up.

1608
02:03:26.82 --> 02:03:28.30
Well, the same thing can happen in your head.

1609
02:03:28.30 --> 02:03:29.86
You get this leadership vacuum in your head

1610
02:03:29.86 --> 02:03:30.86
when you're not leading.

1611
02:03:30.86 --> 02:03:32.86
You're going to start to slide down the path

1612
02:03:32.86 --> 02:03:35.10
of least resistance.

1613
02:03:35.10 --> 02:03:40.10
You're going to slip on down that slippery slope.

1614
02:03:40.10 --> 02:03:41.66
You're going to walk away from discipline.

1615
02:03:41.66 --> 02:03:45.74
You're going to not impose hardship and privation

1616
02:03:45.74 --> 02:03:46.66
on yourself.

1617
02:03:46.66 --> 02:03:48.66
You're not going to push yourself.

1618
02:03:48.66 --> 02:03:53.26
And your morale is going to go down as well.

1619
02:03:53.26 --> 02:03:56.70
And if your morale fails well,

1620
02:03:56.70 --> 02:04:01.46
becomes very easy for you to fail.

1621
02:04:01.46 --> 02:04:03.14
Don't allow that.

1622
02:04:03.14 --> 02:04:05.62
Don't allow your morale to fail.

1623
02:04:05.62 --> 02:04:07.22
Lift up your morale.

1624
02:04:07.22 --> 02:04:13.22
Increase your morale by inflicting yourself with discipline.

1625
02:04:16.66 --> 02:04:19.98
By doing hard things, by controlling your emotions,

1626
02:04:19.98 --> 02:04:23.66
by controlling yourself, and by leading yourself

1627
02:04:23.66 --> 02:04:31.10
on the path of discipline, which as we know.

1628
02:04:31.10 --> 02:04:34.58
At least to freedom.

1629
02:04:34.58 --> 02:04:38.86
And I think that's actually all I've got.

1630
02:04:38.86 --> 02:04:42.14
Fort tonight, so, echo Charles.

1631
02:04:42.14 --> 02:04:49.10
Speaking of controlling ourselves and leading ourselves

1632
02:04:49.10 --> 02:04:52.10
down the path.

1633
02:04:52.10 --> 02:04:55.38
I know you've got some, let's say, some guide posts

1634
02:04:55.38 --> 02:04:59.94
on the path, some markers on the path, some signals

1635
02:04:59.94 --> 02:05:03.66
pointing in the right direction to get us down the path.

1636
02:05:03.66 --> 02:05:06.94
Yeah, so I'll sing about this tuddony.

1637
02:05:06.94 --> 02:05:10.70
I'm watching my daughter's performance.

1638
02:05:10.70 --> 02:05:11.82
Little singing performance.

1639
02:05:11.82 --> 02:05:12.34
Check.

1640
02:05:12.34 --> 02:05:12.98
Does this morning?

1641
02:05:12.98 --> 02:05:14.18
All good.

1642
02:05:14.18 --> 02:05:15.98
So for what reason?

1643
02:05:15.98 --> 02:05:16.34
Good.

1644
02:05:16.34 --> 02:05:17.34
Fine.

1645
02:05:17.34 --> 02:05:19.58
It was a big group of what grade?

1646
02:05:19.58 --> 02:05:20.34
Can't do that.

1647
02:05:20.34 --> 02:05:24.22
No, what grade did you give her when she was done?

1648
02:05:24.22 --> 02:05:25.70
I didn't give a grade.

1649
02:05:25.70 --> 02:05:28.94
How should I know how she's going to improve her performance?

1650
02:05:28.94 --> 02:05:30.62
I'll give her a grade when she gets home.

1651
02:05:30.62 --> 02:05:31.62
Check.

1652
02:05:31.62 --> 02:05:32.62
Okay.

1653
02:05:32.62 --> 02:05:33.62
Good.

1654
02:05:33.62 --> 02:05:34.62
What you're going to give her a grade?

1655
02:05:34.62 --> 02:05:37.38
Probably F for sure, because it's a long story.

1656
02:05:37.38 --> 02:05:39.42
That's beside the point, by the way.

1657
02:05:39.42 --> 02:05:42.26
So an F, probably F, what'd you do?

1658
02:05:42.26 --> 02:05:48.58
Just, it was, there were some things that happened post-performance.

1659
02:05:48.58 --> 02:05:49.58
What?

1660
02:05:49.58 --> 02:05:50.58
That tears?

1661
02:05:50.58 --> 02:05:53.50
That I didn't approve of the reason for the math.

1662
02:05:53.50 --> 02:05:54.50
Okay.

1663
02:05:54.50 --> 02:05:55.50
Tell me anyway.

1664
02:05:55.50 --> 02:05:57.46
Anyway, so that I will go over that later.

1665
02:05:57.46 --> 02:06:01.50
So the point is, I'm thinking, what is the path?

1666
02:06:01.50 --> 02:06:05.30
This is probably the first time I've ever wanted you to go to detail on the story.

1667
02:06:05.30 --> 02:06:08.30
No, no matter.

1668
02:06:08.30 --> 02:06:09.78
Did she freak out?

1669
02:06:09.78 --> 02:06:10.78
No.

1670
02:06:10.78 --> 02:06:11.78
She just gave us a little detail.

1671
02:06:11.78 --> 02:06:12.78
Okay.

1672
02:06:12.78 --> 02:06:13.78
So she's shy.

1673
02:06:13.78 --> 02:06:14.78
She's performing good.

1674
02:06:14.78 --> 02:06:15.78
Fine.

1675
02:06:15.78 --> 02:06:16.78
Like, it's the whole class.

1676
02:06:16.78 --> 02:06:19.22
You know, like, what do you call it?

1677
02:06:19.22 --> 02:06:20.22
And assembly.

1678
02:06:20.22 --> 02:06:21.22
Okay.

1679
02:06:21.22 --> 02:06:22.22
Yeah.

1680
02:06:22.22 --> 02:06:23.22
So we're talking 100 kids on stage.

1681
02:06:23.22 --> 02:06:25.78
Or is it just one class and there's only 25 kids on stage?

1682
02:06:25.78 --> 02:06:26.78
One class.

1683
02:06:26.78 --> 02:06:27.98
And it's not a really a stage.

1684
02:06:27.98 --> 02:06:28.98
It's like, okay.

1685
02:06:28.98 --> 02:06:29.98
It's in the class chart, you know, of course.

1686
02:06:29.98 --> 02:06:30.98
Okay.

1687
02:06:30.98 --> 02:06:32.98
It's a real official scenario.

1688
02:06:32.98 --> 02:06:33.98
Yeah.

1689
02:06:33.98 --> 02:06:36.18
So yeah, they go, they perform good.

1690
02:06:36.18 --> 02:06:37.82
It's for as performance goes fine.

1691
02:06:37.82 --> 02:06:41.38
You know, remember, it's the song she performed in front of us.

1692
02:06:41.38 --> 02:06:42.38
Yep.

1693
02:06:42.38 --> 02:06:44.90
You know, the night before, and the night before that, she'll go good.

1694
02:06:44.90 --> 02:06:49.98
Oh, but then they had to sit down and then the assembly sort of went on.

1695
02:06:49.98 --> 02:06:54.34
So they're sitting down and I look over and I see your crying, which I didn't.

1696
02:06:54.34 --> 02:06:58.58
I was confused, but I know my daughter, like she's like, she's softy like that.

1697
02:06:58.58 --> 02:06:59.58
My fault.

1698
02:06:59.58 --> 02:07:00.58
I know.

1699
02:07:00.58 --> 02:07:03.58
So she's looking back on me.

1700
02:07:03.58 --> 02:07:07.30
She's looking back to me all salty.

1701
02:07:07.30 --> 02:07:13.58
And I'm like, I'm not concerned because I know something didn't go wrong.

1702
02:07:13.58 --> 02:07:15.46
Something's happening that she just doesn't like.

1703
02:07:15.46 --> 02:07:16.82
Like she's tired of sitting there.

1704
02:07:16.82 --> 02:07:17.82
Okay.

1705
02:07:17.82 --> 02:07:18.82
Or something like that.

1706
02:07:18.82 --> 02:07:19.82
So she's looking back at me.

1707
02:07:19.82 --> 02:07:22.94
I'm just like, you know, I don't give it that much attention later on.

1708
02:07:22.94 --> 02:07:26.06
I find out as she's walking to her class because I feel assembly.

1709
02:07:26.06 --> 02:07:27.38
They go to their class.

1710
02:07:27.38 --> 02:07:32.18
And she's like, oh, yeah, I didn't like how long the assembly was going on.

1711
02:07:32.18 --> 02:07:33.54
That's what she said to me.

1712
02:07:33.54 --> 02:07:34.86
Yeah, that's why she was crying.

1713
02:07:34.86 --> 02:07:35.86
That's why she's crying.

1714
02:07:35.86 --> 02:07:36.86
Yeah, yeah.

1715
02:07:36.86 --> 02:07:37.86
Yeah, true.

1716
02:07:37.86 --> 02:07:43.26
And here's the thing, it she shouldn't feel that strongly about it.

1717
02:07:43.26 --> 02:07:45.70
You know, there's something else going on to be honest with you, bro.

1718
02:07:45.70 --> 02:07:49.02
I, she, she's like, softy.

1719
02:07:49.02 --> 02:07:52.54
She's like, I like, it one thing's don't go her way in certain ways.

1720
02:07:52.54 --> 02:07:54.94
So, you know, and she's uncomfortable or whatever.

1721
02:07:54.94 --> 02:07:57.26
So if I were you, how'd break it down like this?

1722
02:07:57.26 --> 02:07:59.54
I wouldn't just give her an F across the board.

1723
02:07:59.54 --> 02:08:04.06
I would give her like a breakout, maybe some different categories.

1724
02:08:04.06 --> 02:08:08.10
I'd give her like an A for singing or maybe a B.

1725
02:08:08.10 --> 02:08:09.10
You know what I mean?

1726
02:08:09.10 --> 02:08:10.66
Cause I'd probably not hit never know, right?

1727
02:08:10.66 --> 02:08:13.02
Maybe a B minus or whatever.

1728
02:08:13.02 --> 02:08:14.78
And then give her, you know, presence.

1729
02:08:14.78 --> 02:08:17.06
I used to, this is how I used to grade my kids when they were do stuff like this.

1730
02:08:17.06 --> 02:08:18.46
I'd give them presence.

1731
02:08:18.46 --> 02:08:19.98
I'd give them attitude.

1732
02:08:19.98 --> 02:08:22.34
I'd give them clarity, anunciation.

1733
02:08:22.34 --> 02:08:24.42
Like there's a bunch of things you can break it down.

1734
02:08:24.42 --> 02:08:28.06
And you don't want to give her five o'clock across the board, obviously.

1735
02:08:28.06 --> 02:08:31.26
Cause you know, five o'clock performer, not an H6, don't exist.

1736
02:08:31.26 --> 02:08:32.26
No, not a bar down.

1737
02:08:32.26 --> 02:08:33.26
It's not a bar down.

1738
02:08:33.26 --> 02:08:34.26
Right.

1739
02:08:34.26 --> 02:08:39.62
So, but then you say listen, by the way, all your performance, which you have, you know,

1740
02:08:39.62 --> 02:08:46.02
you got a 3.8 on, that's your average score, post performance behavior.

1741
02:08:46.02 --> 02:08:48.54
Had to give you a zero, zero.

1742
02:08:48.54 --> 02:08:49.54
Yeah.

1743
02:08:49.54 --> 02:08:50.54
Tears.

1744
02:08:50.54 --> 02:08:51.54
Yeah.

1745
02:08:51.54 --> 02:08:55.46
Don't ever let these other kids know that you've been, you should be having the

1746
02:08:55.46 --> 02:08:56.46
attitude.

1747
02:08:56.46 --> 02:08:58.54
I could stand out here, I could sit out here all day and say, really bring it.

1748
02:08:58.54 --> 02:08:59.54
Check.

1749
02:08:59.54 --> 02:09:00.54
All right.

1750
02:09:00.54 --> 02:09:01.54
It's way.

1751
02:09:01.54 --> 02:09:05.26
So as this is unfolding, oh, this is more to the story.

1752
02:09:05.26 --> 02:09:06.26
Okay.

1753
02:09:06.26 --> 02:09:07.26
Well, that wasn't the point.

1754
02:09:07.26 --> 02:09:08.26
Yeah.

1755
02:09:08.26 --> 02:09:09.26
That was just a setting.

1756
02:09:09.26 --> 02:09:10.26
Yeah.

1757
02:09:10.26 --> 02:09:14.66
But I was just thinking, like, what is the path?

1758
02:09:14.66 --> 02:09:15.66
Like, what is that?

1759
02:09:15.66 --> 02:09:18.46
Is it just the stuff that Jocco does and now we do it?

1760
02:09:18.46 --> 02:09:19.46
No.

1761
02:09:19.46 --> 02:09:20.46
It's not that.

1762
02:09:20.46 --> 02:09:29.50
Actually, right, it's some of the stuff you do in my opinion is essential quintessential.

1763
02:09:29.50 --> 02:09:30.50
Yeah.

1764
02:09:30.50 --> 02:09:31.50
It's like ideal.

1765
02:09:31.50 --> 02:09:32.50
Right.

1766
02:09:32.50 --> 02:09:33.50
That's what I think that's my opinion.

1767
02:09:33.50 --> 02:09:34.50
I'm trying.

1768
02:09:34.50 --> 02:09:36.50
I'm missing by a lot.

1769
02:09:36.50 --> 02:09:37.90
My, you know, I'm coming in.

1770
02:09:37.90 --> 02:09:38.90
I saw it too too.

1771
02:09:38.90 --> 02:09:39.90
Most, most people.

1772
02:09:39.90 --> 02:09:40.90
Oh, yeah.

1773
02:09:40.90 --> 02:09:43.38
But that's just you being hard on the stand, on the scale.

1774
02:09:43.38 --> 02:09:44.38
Right on yourself.

1775
02:09:44.38 --> 02:09:45.38
No.

1776
02:09:45.38 --> 02:09:46.38
Put it this way.

1777
02:09:46.38 --> 02:09:50.42
The path is something specific, but more than that, I just, I just realized,

1778
02:09:50.42 --> 02:09:54.86
not realized, but more like consciously thought of what's not the path.

1779
02:09:54.86 --> 02:09:56.58
That's what, that's important.

1780
02:09:56.58 --> 02:09:59.26
So it's like, okay, if you're doing Jocco, are you not on the path?

1781
02:09:59.26 --> 02:10:00.26
Not necessarily.

1782
02:10:00.26 --> 02:10:05.62
You have to be doing or neglecting some very specific things to not be on the path.

1783
02:10:05.62 --> 02:10:09.74
Like if you don't care about what you're eating, like you're just like whatever.

1784
02:10:09.74 --> 02:10:11.94
Feel sounds good tonight.

1785
02:10:11.94 --> 02:10:18.18
That's told the total standard in which you base your meals on.

1786
02:10:18.18 --> 02:10:19.58
You're probably not on the path.

1787
02:10:19.58 --> 02:10:20.58
That's a big indicator.

1788
02:10:20.58 --> 02:10:22.06
Well, you're one of the factors.

1789
02:10:22.06 --> 02:10:23.82
It's an area where you need to tighten things up.

1790
02:10:23.82 --> 02:10:24.82
Yes.

1791
02:10:24.82 --> 02:10:27.62
Because we know you're not performing optimally if you're not eating correctly.

1792
02:10:27.62 --> 02:10:28.62
Yeah.

1793
02:10:28.62 --> 02:10:32.34
So we'll just say that element is considered not on the path.

1794
02:10:32.34 --> 02:10:33.34
Right.

1795
02:10:33.34 --> 02:10:35.34
So that's just one example of many.

1796
02:10:35.34 --> 02:10:37.46
You know, like if you just straight up don't exercise.

1797
02:10:37.46 --> 02:10:38.46
I don't.

1798
02:10:38.46 --> 02:10:39.46
Yeah.

1799
02:10:39.46 --> 02:10:42.50
And some people have active lifestyles in general and they don't consider it, quote,

1800
02:10:42.50 --> 02:10:43.50
I'm quote, exercise.

1801
02:10:43.50 --> 02:10:45.66
I get it, but then that's different or whatever.

1802
02:10:45.66 --> 02:10:48.10
But if you're like inactive, you're sedentary.

1803
02:10:48.10 --> 02:10:49.10
Yeah.

1804
02:10:49.10 --> 02:10:51.94
That quality is not on the path.

1805
02:10:51.94 --> 02:10:52.94
True.

1806
02:10:52.94 --> 02:10:58.10
So basically what is not on the path is if you have most of the elements of your life

1807
02:10:58.10 --> 02:10:59.50
is not on the path.

1808
02:10:59.50 --> 02:11:00.78
You'll know.

1809
02:11:00.78 --> 02:11:05.18
Also, there's also a really broad thing because you could.

1810
02:11:05.18 --> 02:11:10.70
You don't even if you're, even if you're trying, right?

1811
02:11:10.70 --> 02:11:11.70
That's what the path is.

1812
02:11:11.70 --> 02:11:12.70
Right.

1813
02:11:12.70 --> 02:11:14.42
The path is like, hey, I'm trying.

1814
02:11:14.42 --> 02:11:17.42
Now I guess, yeah, I guess that's a little bit strong.

1815
02:11:17.42 --> 02:11:20.98
I guess I am trying to work out, but I just didn't get it again today.

1816
02:11:20.98 --> 02:11:23.14
So yeah, you know what, you're not on the path.

1817
02:11:23.14 --> 02:11:24.14
That's a good point.

1818
02:11:24.14 --> 02:11:25.14
Yes.

1819
02:11:25.14 --> 02:11:31.66
But you don't have to be, you know, doing the nine hour workout with a six hour

1820
02:11:31.66 --> 02:11:33.06
GJ2 session afterwards.

1821
02:11:33.06 --> 02:11:34.06
No.

1822
02:11:34.06 --> 02:11:35.06
Oh, you only had an hour.

1823
02:11:35.06 --> 02:11:36.78
You only had 30 minutes to train today.

1824
02:11:36.78 --> 02:11:37.78
Cool.

1825
02:11:37.78 --> 02:11:38.78
Got it done quick.

1826
02:11:38.78 --> 02:11:39.78
I did a pretty quick.

1827
02:11:39.78 --> 02:11:40.78
I did 20 minutes today.

1828
02:11:40.78 --> 02:11:41.78
That's what I got to.

1829
02:11:41.78 --> 02:11:43.94
I got flew in late last night.

1830
02:11:43.94 --> 02:11:44.94
Welcome this morning.

1831
02:11:44.94 --> 02:11:45.94
I had another call.

1832
02:11:45.94 --> 02:11:46.94
So I was like, okay, cool.

1833
02:11:46.94 --> 02:11:48.34
I'm going to hammer this thing out.

1834
02:11:48.34 --> 02:11:50.02
I had that window closing too.

1835
02:11:50.02 --> 02:11:52.30
You know, the windows like, well, maybe I'll just pull.

1836
02:11:52.30 --> 02:11:53.30
Oh, yeah.

1837
02:11:53.30 --> 02:11:54.30
That's real.

1838
02:11:54.30 --> 02:11:55.74
Just to me, this is, you know, no, no.

1839
02:11:55.74 --> 02:11:57.98
You can't let the window close.

1840
02:11:57.98 --> 02:11:59.38
That was a really good concept.

1841
02:11:59.38 --> 02:12:01.02
We talked about the GJ2 window.

1842
02:12:01.02 --> 02:12:02.02
Yes.

1843
02:12:02.02 --> 02:12:04.58
It happens with working out too, right?

1844
02:12:04.58 --> 02:12:06.74
Even though that's mostly self imposed.

1845
02:12:06.74 --> 02:12:09.82
It is mostly self imposed for working out, but it does happen.

1846
02:12:09.82 --> 02:12:13.70
If you have work to do a legitimate work, you have meetings, you have calls.

1847
02:12:13.70 --> 02:12:16.90
And you're like, well, you know, I took that one call or I woke up the

1848
02:12:16.90 --> 02:12:19.46
morning and all well, you know, I got that call on it.

1849
02:12:19.46 --> 02:12:22.94
Wait a second, I, you know, I brushing my teeth and wait a second, I'm going to just

1850
02:12:22.94 --> 02:12:23.94
go check my email.

1851
02:12:23.94 --> 02:12:25.34
Oh, now the window, it's all the window.

1852
02:12:25.34 --> 02:12:26.34
No, no, no, no, just shut down.

1853
02:12:26.34 --> 02:12:28.42
I'm going to have to work out later, which will never happen.

1854
02:12:28.42 --> 02:12:29.42
Yeah.

1855
02:12:29.42 --> 02:12:30.42
Don't let the window shut.

1856
02:12:30.42 --> 02:12:31.74
Yeah, just, yeah, jump through it.

1857
02:12:31.74 --> 02:12:33.10
Yeah, jump through the window.

1858
02:12:33.10 --> 02:12:34.10
Jump cool.

1859
02:12:34.10 --> 02:12:36.38
But hey, man.

1860
02:12:36.38 --> 02:12:42.02
And to recognize what the path isn't is just important as recognizing what the path

1861
02:12:42.02 --> 02:12:43.02
is.

1862
02:12:43.02 --> 02:12:45.22
Because if you're like, hey, are you trying to, like, I don't know.

1863
02:12:45.22 --> 02:12:49.02
I mean, what are people saying, like, are you trying to improve yourself or whatever?

1864
02:12:49.02 --> 02:12:52.70
Most people would say, yes, yeah, it would be like, oh, yeah, look at all the things.

1865
02:12:52.70 --> 02:12:56.10
But it's like, you kind of know, you know, like, it's different.

1866
02:12:56.10 --> 02:12:57.10
You just sort of know.

1867
02:12:57.10 --> 02:12:58.10
Yeah.

1868
02:12:58.10 --> 02:13:02.10
Like, if you're doing due to your sort on the path with that alone, maybe not fully,

1869
02:13:02.10 --> 02:13:04.26
but that is a legitimate element.

1870
02:13:04.26 --> 02:13:08.22
So when you do due to it, if you're new or not new, whatever, you're going to need

1871
02:13:08.22 --> 02:13:09.22
a geek.

1872
02:13:09.22 --> 02:13:10.22
Yeah.

1873
02:13:10.22 --> 02:13:11.22
One gear, we're getting.

1874
02:13:11.22 --> 02:13:13.70
I think we all know origin because they're the best geese.

1875
02:13:13.70 --> 02:13:15.70
So how are they the best geese?

1876
02:13:15.70 --> 02:13:16.70
Okay.

1877
02:13:16.70 --> 02:13:19.34
So if you just put one on, you'll sort of know, but here's the indicator.

1878
02:13:19.34 --> 02:13:20.74
Won't go too deep into it.

1879
02:13:20.74 --> 02:13:22.74
But coach Adam.

1880
02:13:22.74 --> 02:13:23.74
Mm-hmm.

1881
02:13:23.74 --> 02:13:27.70
The same coach in way or the way or your kid, by the way, there's a real coach Adam.

1882
02:13:27.70 --> 02:13:32.14
So coach Adam puts on his rift gear inside out.

1883
02:13:32.14 --> 02:13:33.14
Top.

1884
02:13:33.14 --> 02:13:34.14
Yeah.

1885
02:13:34.14 --> 02:13:35.14
The gear top inside out.

1886
02:13:35.14 --> 02:13:36.34
I think he thought it was correct.

1887
02:13:36.34 --> 02:13:37.34
Yeah.

1888
02:13:37.34 --> 02:13:40.06
And that was indicative of just, because it shows the stitching.

1889
02:13:40.06 --> 02:13:41.06
Yeah.

1890
02:13:41.06 --> 02:13:42.06
Yeah.

1891
02:13:42.06 --> 02:13:43.06
And I looked at it.

1892
02:13:43.06 --> 02:13:44.06
I looked at that.

1893
02:13:44.06 --> 02:13:45.06
It looks kind of cool, right?

1894
02:13:45.06 --> 02:13:46.06
Yeah.

1895
02:13:46.06 --> 02:13:51.06
What I grew up in because Pete was saying, he took the genes, origin genes, which are now out.

1896
02:13:51.06 --> 02:13:55.06
And he was expeeed, turned, or he said, hey, if you want to know what the quality of these

1897
02:13:55.06 --> 02:13:57.06
genes turns them in, he turned them inside out.

1898
02:13:57.06 --> 02:13:58.06
He's like, look at what they're talking for.

1899
02:13:58.06 --> 02:13:59.06
The inside.

1900
02:13:59.06 --> 02:14:00.06
So now you have Adam, who sees that?

1901
02:14:00.06 --> 02:14:03.66
You put this gear on inside out, because the quality is so high that you can't even tell.

1902
02:14:03.66 --> 02:14:05.66
He thought that was the correct way to do it.

1903
02:14:05.66 --> 02:14:06.66
That's what he thought that was going to work.

1904
02:14:06.66 --> 02:14:07.66
It was correct.

1905
02:14:07.66 --> 02:14:09.86
I mean, while the logo was all back written and stuff.

1906
02:14:09.86 --> 02:14:11.26
So, you know, he really shouldn't know that.

1907
02:14:11.26 --> 02:14:14.18
But, you know, hey, teach their own and it looked good either way.

1908
02:14:14.18 --> 02:14:16.38
So that's what we're at with origin.

1909
02:14:16.38 --> 02:14:26.46
We got clothing, including genes, gays, t-shirts, sweatshirts, other stuff.

1910
02:14:26.46 --> 02:14:27.82
And then we got supplements as well.

1911
02:14:27.82 --> 02:14:28.82
Yeah.

1912
02:14:28.82 --> 02:14:29.82
Supplements are good.

1913
02:14:29.82 --> 02:14:30.82
Joint warfare.

1914
02:14:30.82 --> 02:14:32.18
I think I'm talking a Greg Train, right.

1915
02:14:32.18 --> 02:14:33.50
One of our main training partners.

1916
02:14:33.50 --> 02:14:35.50
He has a AC joint situation.

1917
02:14:35.50 --> 02:14:36.50
Yeah.

1918
02:14:36.50 --> 02:14:38.18
Two sides by the way.

1919
02:14:38.18 --> 02:14:45.50
And I'm telling him, if you put together the joint warfare with the superkrill oil discipline

1920
02:14:45.50 --> 02:14:49.58
every single day, that thing will heal straight up faster, measureably fast.

1921
02:14:49.58 --> 02:14:50.58
100%.

1922
02:14:50.58 --> 02:14:53.10
Then just look at my knee situation.

1923
02:14:53.10 --> 02:14:55.46
Which, man, I'm a believer now.

1924
02:14:55.46 --> 02:14:57.70
You're now a believer.

1925
02:14:57.70 --> 02:15:04.86
I'm increased my beliefs of my own personal kind of like Wolverine healing powers.

1926
02:15:04.86 --> 02:15:05.86
Yeah.

1927
02:15:05.86 --> 02:15:06.94
And I've been choked about before even that wasn't really Joe.

1928
02:15:06.94 --> 02:15:10.62
You know, you joke about something, but you kind of mean it.

1929
02:15:10.62 --> 02:15:11.62
Yeah.

1930
02:15:11.62 --> 02:15:12.62
I feel real lucky, man.

1931
02:15:12.62 --> 02:15:15.46
Real lucky, because my knee was straight up.

1932
02:15:15.46 --> 02:15:16.46
Oh, yeah.

1933
02:15:16.46 --> 02:15:17.46
Endered.

1934
02:15:17.46 --> 02:15:20.82
And it's not healed yet, but dang, if it hasn't progressed a lot.

1935
02:15:20.82 --> 02:15:21.82
Yeah.

1936
02:15:21.82 --> 02:15:22.82
Yeah.

1937
02:15:22.82 --> 02:15:27.06
And it's not like, you know, when you're like 18 years old, maybe a lighter weight

1938
02:15:27.06 --> 02:15:30.18
person or something, it's like you tend to sort of heal faster.

1939
02:15:30.18 --> 02:15:31.18
Yeah.

1940
02:15:31.18 --> 02:15:33.18
But it's face that you're, you know, your old school.

1941
02:15:33.18 --> 02:15:34.18
And you're not.

1942
02:15:34.18 --> 02:15:36.18
Very small school or maybe not.

1943
02:15:36.18 --> 02:15:37.18
Oh, they're good.

1944
02:15:37.18 --> 02:15:38.58
Your old school, right?

1945
02:15:38.58 --> 02:15:41.74
And, you know, what are you walking around at 230 to 35?

1946
02:15:41.74 --> 02:15:45.10
I mean, I'm just saying that's not an easy racket for the knee.

1947
02:15:45.10 --> 02:15:46.10
So all the time.

1948
02:15:46.10 --> 02:15:47.10
Yeah.

1949
02:15:47.10 --> 02:15:49.06
Meanwhile, you're just boom, boom, boom, bouncing back that fast.

1950
02:15:49.06 --> 02:15:50.06
That's saying a lot.

1951
02:15:50.06 --> 02:15:51.06
Yeah.

1952
02:15:51.06 --> 02:15:52.06
See you in a big lot.

1953
02:15:52.06 --> 02:15:53.94
Join Warfare, Cril Oil.

1954
02:15:53.94 --> 02:15:54.94
Get some of that.

1955
02:15:54.94 --> 02:16:00.98
Also the discipline and discipline go ahead of scenario the other day.

1956
02:16:00.98 --> 02:16:02.82
That's actually yesterday.

1957
02:16:02.82 --> 02:16:03.82
Sure.

1958
02:16:03.82 --> 02:16:04.82
Crazy flight situation.

1959
02:16:04.82 --> 02:16:10.26
Understandably rerouting, landing buses, trains is ridiculous.

1960
02:16:10.26 --> 02:16:14.42
Anyways, I'm going into an interview on two hours of sleep.

1961
02:16:14.42 --> 02:16:15.42
Oh, dang.

1962
02:16:15.42 --> 02:16:16.42
Yeah.

1963
02:16:16.42 --> 02:16:18.90
And this is just after, you know, Peter at T.

1964
02:16:18.90 --> 02:16:27.38
is telling me about all the horrible, like cognitive problems that are going to

1965
02:16:27.38 --> 02:16:28.38
give you cause.

1966
02:16:28.38 --> 02:16:34.14
And so yeah, I took, I took like two discipline go.

1967
02:16:34.14 --> 02:16:39.02
When I woke up, I got the interview and then I got there and I did a little bit of, you

1968
02:16:39.02 --> 02:16:40.42
know, playing around, or not playing around.

1969
02:16:40.42 --> 02:16:44.10
But they were like prepping for the interview and then I took like three more.

1970
02:16:44.10 --> 02:16:48.36
So I took five discipline go, rocked it.

1971
02:16:48.36 --> 02:16:49.62
I went to those like, I got what?

1972
02:16:49.62 --> 02:16:50.62
You got a question.

1973
02:16:50.62 --> 02:16:52.90
Let me tell you, I think we can get some more.

1974
02:16:52.90 --> 02:16:58.78
So anyways, try that discipline go out if you need something to focus your cognitive.

1975
02:16:58.78 --> 02:17:05.78
So you can get some of that or you can get the discipline go.

1976
02:17:05.78 --> 02:17:08.70
You need the discipline powder.

1977
02:17:08.70 --> 02:17:10.94
Should we just call that Prejujitsu powder?

1978
02:17:10.94 --> 02:17:13.50
Yeah, that's it's starting itself out to me.

1979
02:17:13.50 --> 02:17:17.26
Yeah, it kind of turns like something where you are going to jitsu.

1980
02:17:17.26 --> 02:17:21.14
You're going to need cognitive skills and you know, you're going to need some physical

1981
02:17:21.14 --> 02:17:26.94
skills or some physical enhancements.

1982
02:17:26.94 --> 02:17:27.94
Sure.

1983
02:17:27.94 --> 02:17:29.94
I'm going to call the couple scoops of discipline.

1984
02:17:29.94 --> 02:17:30.94
Maybe three.

1985
02:17:30.94 --> 02:17:31.94
If you need to.

1986
02:17:31.94 --> 02:17:32.94
If you want to get nuts.

1987
02:17:32.94 --> 02:17:33.94
Yeah, that's a good one.

1988
02:17:33.94 --> 02:17:34.94
That's part of my everyday now.

1989
02:17:34.94 --> 02:17:36.94
I'm pulling the Dave Burke everyday.

1990
02:17:36.94 --> 02:17:41.10
Yeah, that's I was, look, there's one thing that's good about it.

1991
02:17:41.10 --> 02:17:43.74
It doesn't have some crazy amount of caffeine in it.

1992
02:17:43.74 --> 02:17:45.94
You don't want to be all I am up on caffeine.

1993
02:17:45.94 --> 02:17:47.94
When you take something, because it's tough to make me feel really good.

1994
02:17:47.94 --> 02:17:51.22
Well, you just took a big hit at caffeine and you're going to get what's that word.

1995
02:17:51.22 --> 02:17:53.94
You're going to get a tolerance to it and then it's not going to have to be effected.

1996
02:17:53.94 --> 02:17:57.54
Discipline has like 15 milligrams of caffeine at per scoop. That's not that much.

1997
02:17:57.54 --> 02:18:00.54
So what do you feel like the.

1998
02:18:00.54 --> 02:18:02.90
You're not really feeling you're feeling the other.

1999
02:18:02.90 --> 02:18:04.54
Yeah, ingredients in there.

2000
02:18:04.54 --> 02:18:09.38
So don't don't fool yourself and get all amped up on caffeine.

2001
02:18:09.38 --> 02:18:12.94
You know, or otherwise you might as well go do meth or cocaine.

2002
02:18:12.94 --> 02:18:14.94
Or just getting some coffee with you.

2003
02:18:14.94 --> 02:18:17.94
You know, you know, you know, that's kind of off the.

2004
02:18:17.94 --> 02:18:18.94
No, I'm just kidding.

2005
02:18:18.94 --> 02:18:20.94
Children don't do meth or cocaine.

2006
02:18:20.94 --> 02:18:21.94
Don't do drugs.

2007
02:18:21.94 --> 02:18:22.94
Period.

2008
02:18:22.94 --> 02:18:31.94
If you want to do something that gives you sort of a addiction, try some strawberry milk,

2009
02:18:31.94 --> 02:18:33.94
which is now out for adults.

2010
02:18:33.94 --> 02:18:35.94
It is absolutely delicious.

2011
02:18:35.94 --> 02:18:38.94
If you want some extra protein in your body.

2012
02:18:38.94 --> 02:18:41.94
So you can get bigger, stronger, faster.

2013
02:18:43.94 --> 02:18:44.94
Better.

2014
02:18:44.94 --> 02:18:45.94
Yeah, true.

2015
02:18:45.94 --> 02:18:49.94
And you and or or if you just want dessert.

2016
02:18:49.94 --> 02:18:50.94
Yeah.

2017
02:18:50.94 --> 02:18:52.94
You just want some dessert.

2018
02:18:52.94 --> 02:18:56.94
Have some strawberry milk or some peanut butter milk or some mint milk or something.

2019
02:18:56.94 --> 02:18:58.94
Nella or dark chocolate.

2020
02:18:58.94 --> 02:18:59.94
There you go.

2021
02:18:59.94 --> 02:19:01.94
And chocolate tea.

2022
02:19:01.94 --> 02:19:03.94
If you're into tea or even if you're not into tea.

2023
02:19:03.94 --> 02:19:04.94
Really.

2024
02:19:04.94 --> 02:19:06.94
And there's really into tea.

2025
02:19:06.94 --> 02:19:08.94
You know, against it.

2026
02:19:08.94 --> 02:19:10.94
But, you know, this one of those things.

2027
02:19:10.94 --> 02:19:11.94
So the OG original.

2028
02:19:11.94 --> 02:19:13.94
Jocco white tea.

2029
02:19:13.94 --> 02:19:14.94
Pomegranate.

2030
02:19:14.94 --> 02:19:15.94
Yeah.

2031
02:19:15.94 --> 02:19:16.94
Right.

2032
02:19:16.94 --> 02:19:17.94
Not a pomegranate.

2033
02:19:17.94 --> 02:19:18.94
Chai.

2034
02:19:18.94 --> 02:19:19.94
No.

2035
02:19:19.94 --> 02:19:19.94
White tea.

2036
02:19:19.94 --> 02:19:25.94
Jocco decides to make his own light tea with side effects dead lifting 8000 pounds.

2037
02:19:25.94 --> 02:19:26.94
All right.

2038
02:19:26.94 --> 02:19:27.94
I'll roll with it.

2039
02:19:27.94 --> 02:19:28.94
It's actually pretty good.

2040
02:19:28.94 --> 02:19:29.94
So yeah, get that.

2041
02:19:29.94 --> 02:19:32.94
It is available on Jocco store now, by the way.

2042
02:19:32.94 --> 02:19:33.94
And I'm a so.

2043
02:19:33.94 --> 02:19:35.94
And, you know, just going to go on the internet.

2044
02:19:35.94 --> 02:19:37.94
Basically, you get it.

2045
02:19:37.94 --> 02:19:39.94
So yeah, that's a good one.

2046
02:19:39.94 --> 02:19:41.94
Speaking of this jocco store.

2047
02:19:41.94 --> 02:19:42.94
Jocco does have a store.

2048
02:19:42.94 --> 02:19:44.94
It's called Jocco store.

2049
02:19:44.94 --> 02:19:46.94
Just like this is called Jocco podcast.

2050
02:19:46.94 --> 02:19:47.94
Jocco store.

2051
02:19:47.94 --> 02:19:49.94
So Jocco store commas for this online store.

2052
02:19:49.94 --> 02:19:51.94
This is where you can get rash guards for you.

2053
02:19:51.94 --> 02:19:56.94
Jiu Jitsu to supplement your geese from Warton.

2054
02:19:56.94 --> 02:19:59.94
Also to your new no-gui correct.

2055
02:19:59.94 --> 02:20:00.94
You can wear a rash guard.

2056
02:20:00.94 --> 02:20:01.94
Oh, yeah.

2057
02:20:01.94 --> 02:20:02.94
It's kind of if you're doing it.

2058
02:20:02.94 --> 02:20:06.94
You can bring workouts using your rings.

2059
02:20:06.94 --> 02:20:10.94
If you're doing dips, if you're doing ring push ups, if you're doing muscle ups,

2060
02:20:10.94 --> 02:20:15.94
you're the what is it the what would Greg chain say like the outside of your arm.

2061
02:20:15.94 --> 02:20:18.94
He's got he was always got the medical to everything.

2062
02:20:18.94 --> 02:20:19.94
You're redo.

2063
02:20:19.94 --> 02:20:21.94
Whatever you'll get all like shaved up.

2064
02:20:21.94 --> 02:20:22.94
Yeah.

2065
02:20:22.94 --> 02:20:25.94
When you're doing a bunch of muscle ups or a bunch of ring dips or whatever.

2066
02:20:25.94 --> 02:20:26.94
If you were rash guard, you won't.

2067
02:20:26.94 --> 02:20:28.94
Oh, Jocco going for comfort over here.

2068
02:20:28.94 --> 02:20:32.94
Speaking of comfort, if you like even so I got into writing like a little bit.

2069
02:20:32.94 --> 02:20:36.94
Not totally but if you were a rash guard writing bike like cycling.

2070
02:20:36.94 --> 02:20:37.94
Yeah.

2071
02:20:37.94 --> 02:20:39.94
It's like surprisingly.

2072
02:20:39.94 --> 02:20:42.94
I'm going to say it's surprisingly comfortable.

2073
02:20:42.94 --> 02:20:43.94
Functional.

2074
02:20:43.94 --> 02:20:44.94
It's functional.

2075
02:20:44.94 --> 02:20:45.94
That did.

2076
02:20:45.94 --> 02:20:48.94
So, you know, there's a lot of other things you we do with our rash guards.

2077
02:20:48.94 --> 02:20:51.94
And actually I forgot to say this.

2078
02:20:51.94 --> 02:20:53.94
We forgot to say this for a while.

2079
02:20:53.94 --> 02:20:56.94
It does add another 19% performance.

2080
02:20:56.94 --> 02:20:58.94
And literally everything you do.

2081
02:20:58.94 --> 02:20:59.94
Literally.

2082
02:20:59.94 --> 02:21:00.94
Yeah.

2083
02:21:00.94 --> 02:21:01.94
Also typically proven.

2084
02:21:01.94 --> 02:21:02.94
Yeah.

2085
02:21:02.94 --> 02:21:03.94
100%.

2086
02:21:03.94 --> 02:21:04.94
Also t-shirts.

2087
02:21:04.94 --> 02:21:05.94
If you want to represent discipline equals freedom.

2088
02:21:05.94 --> 02:21:06.94
Good.

2089
02:21:06.94 --> 02:21:09.94
Any of the layers that we've come to.

2090
02:21:09.94 --> 02:21:10.94
Exploite.

2091
02:21:10.94 --> 02:21:12.94
Is that the character terminology?

2092
02:21:12.94 --> 02:21:14.94
Makes people like the layers.

2093
02:21:14.94 --> 02:21:15.94
Um, anyway.

2094
02:21:15.94 --> 02:21:16.94
Explore the layers.

2095
02:21:16.94 --> 02:21:17.94
Explore for sure that.

2096
02:21:17.94 --> 02:21:21.94
Sometimes you exploit the layers which you know it's questionable behavior.

Also for the video version of this podcast if you want to watch it rather than just listen to it.

2119
02:22:26.94 --> 02:22:28.94
We do have a YouTube channel.

2121
02:22:30.94 --> 02:22:36.94
If you want to, you know, share some elements of the podcast that are good takeaways individually.

Um, share them with your friends. It's not like, hey, I saw this.

2125
02:22:43.94 --> 02:22:43.94

02:22:48.94 --> 02:22:48.94
Yeah.

2130
02:22:48.94 --> 02:22:50.94
And I can listen to that on a whim.

2131
02:22:50.94 --> 02:22:51.94
Yeah.

2132
02:22:51.94 --> 02:22:53.94
So you can just, you know, send them a little hit or write them.

2133
02:22:53.94 --> 02:22:53.94
Yeah.

2134
02:22:53.94 --> 02:22:55.94
Oh, that's what we should have called them.

2135
02:22:55.94 --> 02:22:57.94
Little little video hitters.

2136
02:22:57.94 --> 02:22:58.94
Sure.

2137
02:22:58.94 --> 02:22:59.94
There you go.

2138
02:22:59.94 --> 02:23:01.94
I like that better than make nuggets.

2139
02:23:01.94 --> 02:23:03.94
No, Brad, you're the one who made up jockel.

2140
02:23:03.94 --> 02:23:06.94
I can't change my mind and come up with something better, a little video hitter.

2141
02:23:06.94 --> 02:23:07.94
All right.

2142
02:23:07.94 --> 02:23:08.94
There it is.

2143
02:23:08.94 --> 02:23:09.94
That video hitter.

2144
02:23:09.94 --> 02:23:11.94
You need to make more of those hitters.

2145
02:23:11.94 --> 02:23:12.94
Yes, sir. There you go.

2146
02:23:12.94 --> 02:23:18.94
But nonetheless, if you're interested in any video things hitters, hitters, in regards to this

2147
02:23:18.94 --> 02:23:22.94
But it's probably an acquired situation.

2148
02:23:22.94 --> 02:23:24.94
It just sounds cooler when Theo says it.

2149
02:23:24.94 --> 02:23:25.94
Yeah.

2150
02:23:25.94 --> 02:23:26.94
I know.

2151
02:23:26.94 --> 02:23:28.94
So I'm like, I'm used to you saying it.

2152
02:23:28.94 --> 02:23:29.94
So it's cool.

2153
02:23:29.94 --> 02:23:30.94
But me saying I'm not ready yet.

2154
02:23:30.94 --> 02:23:31.94
Mm-hmm.

2155
02:23:31.94 --> 02:23:32.94

02:23:53.94 --> 02:23:54.94

Because he's a bad ass and you want to start a company.

One that says time is running out.

2179
02:24:27.94 --> 02:24:29.94
One that says discipline equals freedom.

You see little kids running around with cold.

2202

You know, running knows this.

2203
02:25:16.94 --> 02:25:18.94
Yeah, you're just hitting your kids going to school.

2204
02:25:18.94 --> 02:25:22.94
Your kid is just a host for disease to back into your house.

2205
02:25:22.94 --> 02:25:23.94
A little last.

2206
02:25:23.94 --> 02:25:24.94
Especially when they're crying.

2207
02:25:24.94 --> 02:25:29.94
I know.

2208
02:25:29.94 --> 02:25:30.94
So yeah, I've been on that.

So yeah, on it dot com slash jockels.

2213

We got some books.

2214
02:25:39.94 --> 02:25:41.94
I have a new book coming out.

2215
02:25:41.94 --> 02:25:43.94
It is called Way of the Warrior Kid 3.

2216
02:25:43.94 --> 02:25:45.94
Where there's a will.

2217
02:25:45.94 --> 02:25:47.94
It is available for pre-order right now.

2218
02:25:47.94 --> 02:25:51.94
The publishing company needs to know how many of these books to print.

2219
02:25:51.94 --> 02:25:56.94
The publishing company is me.

2220
02:25:56.94 --> 02:25:57.94
Sure.

2221
02:25:57.94 --> 02:26:00.94
So if you want to have this book, please pre-order it ASAP.

2222
02:26:00.94 --> 02:26:03.94
So I know how many copies to print.

2223
02:26:03.94 --> 02:26:06.94
The name of the book is Way of the Warrior Kid 3.

2224
02:26:06.94 --> 02:26:08.94
And I'm actually putting that on the cover.

2225
02:26:08.94 --> 02:26:12.94
Now, when I made Way of the Warrior Kid 2, I said to the publisher,

2226
02:26:12.94 --> 02:26:15.94
Haken, we put Way of the Warrior Kid 2 on the cover.

2227
02:26:15.94 --> 02:26:18.94
And they said, no, we can't do that.

2228
02:26:18.94 --> 02:26:19.94
And I said, well, why not?

2229
02:26:19.94 --> 02:26:23.94
And they said, well, if people know it's the second in the series,

2230
02:26:23.94 --> 02:26:26.94
and they don't have the first, they won't buy it.

2231
02:26:26.94 --> 02:26:28.94
So we can't put that on the cover.

2232
02:26:28.94 --> 02:26:30.94
We don't want to hurt sales.

2233
02:26:30.94 --> 02:26:35.94
So I said, I thought to myself, oh, we're just trying to confuse people.

2234
02:26:35.94 --> 02:26:36.94
So they will buy more.

2235
02:26:36.94 --> 02:26:38.94
I'm not trying to confuse anybody here.

2236
02:26:38.94 --> 02:26:41.94
Way of the Warrior Kid 3 on the cover.

2237
02:26:41.94 --> 02:26:44.94
It's the third book in the series.

2238
02:26:44.94 --> 02:26:48.94
John Bosac, the artist, thinks it's the best book in the series.

2239
02:26:48.94 --> 02:26:50.94
Lessons to be learned.

2240
02:26:50.94 --> 02:26:51.94
Shusty.

2241
02:26:51.94 --> 02:26:54.94
There's also Way of the Warrior Kid 2, which is called Mark's Mission.

2242
02:26:54.94 --> 02:26:58.94
And there's the original Way of the Warrior Kid.

2243
02:26:58.94 --> 02:27:01.94
And then on top of that, for your children,

2244
02:27:01.94 --> 02:27:03.94
and possibly for you too.

2245
02:27:03.94 --> 02:27:05.94
We got Mike in the Dragons.

2246
02:27:05.94 --> 02:27:08.94
You can order that one now.

2247
02:27:08.94 --> 02:27:12.94
For your younger kids, also the Dispeningro's Freedom Field Manual.

2248
02:27:12.94 --> 02:27:13.94
I already talked about that one.

2249
02:27:13.94 --> 02:27:17.94
The audio of that is on iTunes, not on audible.

2250
02:27:17.94 --> 02:27:21.94
So it's on MP3 in an Extreme Ownership and DiCotomy Leadership,

2251
02:27:21.94 --> 02:27:23.94
which I wrote with my brother, Lave Babin.

2252
02:27:23.94 --> 02:27:26.94
And we talk about leadership from our perspective,

2253
02:27:26.94 --> 02:27:29.94
going from the military, combat,

2254
02:27:29.94 --> 02:27:31.94
taking those lessons, learning to bring it back,

2255
02:27:31.94 --> 02:27:36.94
and now turning them over to the civilian sector.

2256
02:27:36.94 --> 02:27:42.94

where we will take individuals from special operations and the combat aviation communities

2290
02:29:28.94 --> 02:29:32.94
and put them into leadership positions inside of companies.

2291
02:29:32.94 --> 02:29:35.94
That need leadership inside their organization.

2292
02:29:35.94 --> 02:29:38.94
So if you're looking for leadership,

2293
02:29:38.94 --> 02:29:39.94
which you are,

2294
02:29:39.94 --> 02:29:42.94

2295
02:29:42.94 --> 02:29:44.94
is because of leadership.

2301
02:30:04.94 --> 02:30:08.94
The Facebook, the Facebook,

2302
02:30:08.94 --> 02:30:10.94

2303
02:30:10.94 --> 02:30:11.94
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2304
02:30:11.94 --> 02:30:12.94
I didn't know that.

2305
02:30:12.94 --> 02:30:13.94
And Justin Timberlake was like,

2306
02:30:13.94 --> 02:30:15.94
hey, don't, sorry, not Justin Timberlake.

2307
02:30:15.94 --> 02:30:16.94
Sean Park, Parker.

2308
02:30:16.94 --> 02:30:19.94
Anyway, you ever seen the movie that shows,

2309
02:30:19.94 --> 02:30:20.94
you know what I was the reason?

2310
02:30:20.94 --> 02:30:22.94
He said, drop the, the,

2311
02:30:22.94 --> 02:30:23.94
just Facebook.

2312
02:30:23.94 --> 02:30:25.94
Who says,

2313
02:30:25.94 --> 02:30:27.94
Sean Parker, the Napster guy.

2314
02:30:27.94 --> 02:30:28.94
Okay.

2315
02:30:28.94 --> 02:30:30.94
Played by Justin Timberlake in the movie.

2316
02:30:30.94 --> 02:30:31.94
Oh, God, it got it.

2317
02:30:31.94 --> 02:30:32.94
Very good.

2318
02:30:32.94 --> 02:30:35.94
If you're on those platforms.

2319
02:30:35.94 --> 02:30:36.94
Sure.

2320
02:30:36.94 --> 02:30:38.94
Yeah, I'm at Echo Charles.

2321
02:30:38.94 --> 02:30:39.94
Jocquoise at Jocquoise.

2322
02:30:39.94 --> 02:30:40.94
Yeah.

2323
02:30:40.94 --> 02:30:41.94
On all of them.

2324
02:30:41.94 --> 02:30:42.94
Don't keep it simple like that.

2325
02:30:42.94 --> 02:30:46.94
And thanks to all of our military folks out there

2326
02:30:46.94 --> 02:30:52.94
who keep their morale high and keep their bayonets sharp

2327
02:30:52.94 --> 02:30:54.94
out there on the line.

2328
02:30:54.94 --> 02:31:00.94
And thanks to the police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and

2329
02:31:00.94 --> 02:31:07.94
dispatchers and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service and all the other first responders.

2330
02:31:07.94 --> 02:31:14.94
Thanks to all of you for standing up and facing evil so that we don't have to.

2331
02:31:14.94 --> 02:31:18.94
And to everyone else out there.

2332
02:31:18.94 --> 02:31:21.94
You're,

2333
02:31:21.94 --> 02:31:24.94
you're morale.

2334
02:31:24.94 --> 02:31:27.94
You might be low from time to time.

2335
02:31:27.94 --> 02:31:29.94
They can happen.

2336
02:31:29.94 --> 02:31:31.94
They can happen to anyone.

2337
02:31:31.94 --> 02:31:33.94
And it does happen to everyone.

2338
02:31:33.94 --> 02:31:36.94
And when it does start to slip recognize it.

2339
02:31:36.94 --> 02:31:42.94
And then remember that you can actually do something about it.

2340
02:31:42.94 --> 02:31:44.94
Like young.

2341
02:31:44.94 --> 02:31:45.94
Evil,

2342
02:31:45.94 --> 02:31:46.94
Roberry said,

2343
02:31:46.94 --> 02:31:47.94
not letter.

2344
02:31:47.94 --> 02:31:49.94
Don't grieve.

2345
02:31:49.94 --> 02:31:50.94
Don't cry.

2346
02:31:50.94 --> 02:31:52.94
Don't worry or fret.

2347
02:31:52.94 --> 02:31:55.94
Surely there's no better way of dying.

2348
02:31:55.94 --> 02:31:58.94
He said.

2349
02:31:58.94 --> 02:32:01.94
Then fighting.

2350
02:32:01.94 --> 02:32:03.94
Then standing up.

2351
02:32:03.94 --> 02:32:06.94
And that is what you do.

2352
02:32:06.94 --> 02:32:07.94
You fight.

2353
02:32:07.94 --> 02:32:08.94
You stand up.

2354
02:32:08.94 --> 02:32:10.94
You impose discipline on your life.

2355
02:32:10.94 --> 02:32:13.94
You face the things that you fear.

2356
02:32:13.94 --> 02:32:16.94
The things that are crushing your morale.

2357
02:32:16.94 --> 02:32:19.94
You face them.

2358
02:32:19.94 --> 02:32:27.94
And you lift up your morale through force of will by leading by going out.

2359
02:32:27.94 --> 02:32:30.94
And getting after it.

2360
02:32:30.94 --> 02:32:33.94
And so until next time,

2361
02:32:33.94 --> 02:32:58.94
this is echo and jacco out.
