There they exist, there there may even be a video somewhere, I don't know, so it was water woman and her nemesis was oily ale and the skit was really a day in the life of oily ale and you know he'd be out there like you know throwing his trash out on the street or changing the oil in his car and then dumping the dirty oil down a storm drain, you know, dumping a bunch of pesticides and his garden and every step of the way, water woman comes in just a lick of time and saves the day and tells oily ale like if you dump your dirty car oil down the storm drain it's gonna kill all the fish in the water and you know what until the kids when you go surfing the water's gonna be really gross and it was just the coolest thing to like see all these kids sit in cross like it on the ground like you know for a second, third graders and seeing kind of like the light bulb go off in their eyes because these were examples that they could understand and relate to and that was my hope in doing this was that you know it would at least plan to seed for them to understand and appreciate their consequences to your actions and and we care very much about our home and so stop and think for a minute before you do something or if you see uncle or auntie like auntie don't throw your trash out the car window and and be able to start to make more of a you know I don't behave your all kind of change and impact to protect our home. and I I wondered then it when you had recorded that because it was literally addressing everything that we were seeing play out right right before us as far as the warning signs and the dangers of this is where this is where you end up once you allow for this kind of control and once we as people accept it but little sidetrack funny story and I'll show you the video after because we'll take me a minute to dig it up but it won't surprise you to know that on the presidential campaign trail sleep was hard to come by for me and for two reasons one was just a factor of time in the day but also it was tough for me to um tough for me to turn turn everything off and actually just get like I'm not even talking about hours I'm just talking about just some a good slice of good quality rest in sleep um we were in New Hampshire in the middle of winter and there was a rare opportunity where I got to take a nap and we'd like rented a like an Airbnb or something like that and um so I took a nap and my husband took a video of me taking a nap because he walked in the room and I'm lying there and I'm asleep and I'm all bundled up under the covers and I got my phone sitting on my um on the top of the covers and I was listening to jaccopodcast with a guy from the French foreign legion and I'll show you the video because I am dead asleep and uh my husband came and he has the camera going picks up my phone looks at and the reason I remember this is because this was on February 11th, February 11th, 2020 and it just so happened that it popped up on my phone on February 11th of this year as like the memory thing or whatever and I was debating sending it to you and I told my husband I was like we didn't get the wrong idea and think I'm like boarded at the spotcast and he's like no what it showed was like I was able to completely tune out the noise of of what was going on in my mind of the day to day and and be able to kind of be transported to a different conversation and topic and and all this other stuff so then you decide you're going to run when is that that's what when do you figure that out when do you figure out when do you say to yourself you know what I need to run for president the event that triggered the event that ultimately led to my making that decision was the happened in January of 2018 and it was I'm sure you remember this echo but it was when on a Saturday morning we got a text alert sent out every cell phone in the state civil defense alarms sounding saying missile incoming to Hawaii seek immediate shelter this is not a drill and the aftermath of that where immediately we're thinking like I've been working the issue related to North Korea for a very long time for obvious reasons that North Korea is continuing to develop their nuclear capabilities they're developing their intercontinental ballistic missile range capabilities miniaturize nuclear warheads that that not only could reach Hawaii but could reach a significant portion of the mainland at that time in 2018 now they have continued to develop that and they can reach anywhere in the country but this is the scenario that's playing out get this message North Korea is sending you know a nuclear missile to us which means we have 15 minutes to live I was in DC when this happened all of my loved ones my family everyone is in Hawaii and what happened there was absolutely terrifying where you know there there was a video that came out after was an iPhone video that this this father took as he lowered his little eight-year-old girl by having she was about eight years old down a manhole telling her that this is the only place you'll be safe and with the camera saying like if I don't make it you know at least I want you to be okay there's countless countless stories of people that I heard from after this event happened about about what they went through in you know there was a guy who he had like he had one of his kids that was in town another kid that was on the west side of the island and in why and I and he was somewhere in the middle and in that moment got that message trying to decide which am I going to drive to town or drive to why and I which of my kids am I going to try to get to to spend those last minutes of my life with you know mothers going in the bathtub like seek shelter everyone's look where do I go friend of mine for real no joke and like the sideways glances like is it okay to go and talk to her now or not and like I don't want to be you know like thought to be I don't know part of whatever she's doing like I don't know like there's all these different things and how about the fact that now like whoever told you hey now all the things you're gonna try to do are gonna get squashed you're not gonna be able to make any progress here that's a real thing and so again going back to this strategic decision making if you're trying to take here your constituents and you make the worst enemy that you can have in DC that's not good well what what I what ended up happening obviously as she did not win the election and some of those very same people who remain good friends of mine who were being honest with me then saying you're politically finished then came back to me later and said well turns out you saw something that nobody else saw at that time but but when when someone does this in a more from a better from a better like from a better position it seems like it's well this is what I'm getting at because I was going to ask you well at some point is a reach a tipping point it seems like the tipping point there it's just that someone needs to step in and say okay we are going to actually drain out this swamp we're going to actually get rid of this there's lobbies are going to get you know controls put on them we're going to do things that we're going to move this in the right direction it seems like as you said Americans a lot of Americans are looking at the political system going you got to be kidding me and look you tell me stories earlier today before we hit record it's got it's sickening it's sickening and so as that word gets out it seems like America's ready to go you know what we're done with this shit over here and and Trump was like the first guy that said hey I'll help you out and so everyone it cool sounds good you go raise hell basically if someone that says yep but really the bigger issue that I I wanted to raise by filing this lawsuit was you've got this massive big tech company who has the power to um interfere in the public square of our democracy and you know who knows still to this day like was it some guy sitting at a computer was like man fuck tells you gathered I'm gonna punch this button and show her what's up or like who knows I don't know what happened but it happened and if it can happen to a sitting member of Congress who's running for the highest office in the land it could happen to anybody running for office anybody who's speaking out anybody being critical of whether it's big tech or government policy like whatever the motive um this is the power that they have in their hands that's incredibly dangerous in undermining the the kind of core pillars of our democracy of a having a marketplace of free ideas and voters who can you know get the information they need and ultimately make the decision that they want to make are they allowed to are they allowed to mess with like Google ad words from a political perspective so I know the words if I was running against you and I bought the ad word Tulsi Gabbard and brought it to a freaking Russian newspaper article about how they're your favorite so when I Google Tulsi Gabbard I click on the first article that comes up it shows me that you're a Russian plant can I do that in the political realm because look they do it with like I I mean obviously Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton were kind of the two primary candidates but there were a few others who were still running at that time Martin O'Malley was wanting to go for Maryland and so that that was kind of already happening but ultimately as as this process started to to begin I saw how even in these limited debate settings how little attention was being focused by the Democratic Party as well as their their corporate media partners on foreign policy and on the the qualifications that voters may look for in a commander in chief and what that responsibility meant it was just not it was you know they were talking about a bunch of other things most most things that to me like superficial political drama and theater like not issues that that really mattered a whole lot when you look at the implications on people everyday lives but as a soldier obviously for me like this is the most well it's not just as a soldier the most important responsibility that that any president has is to service commander and chief you know our constitution very clearly like I can have all the economic positions I want and positions on education and positions on health care as president I can't do anything of of great impact without working with Congress and that's I mean that that's the it's it's the check-in balance that our our founders had in mind for us which is a good thing but there's only one commander in chief and it ultimately drove me to resign as vice chair of the DNC and and in door Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton because I saw a huge gap and difference contrast between the two of them and in Hillary Clinton's very interventionist kind of war hawk war-monger track record both the secretary of state and and as a u.a. senator versus Bernie Sanders who through his time and service had proven to have more of a non-interventionist leaning and be a little bit more critical in questioning of any rush to war and I you know on a whole host of other issues I didn't you know Bernie but we were we were physically located very very far away from the flagpole and then the big bases that that exist in Kuwait so we were within an active Kuwait-y naval base and right on the water which you know it's my gig I gotta be close to the water if I can um but our our main mission the artillery battalion had kind of a forced protection mission but my platoon uh we had had two things one was kind of security like like high level security if we had VIPs coming into Kuwait or and we worked with the embassy a lot we did a lot of stuff in and around the embassy so like PSD like personal security you know we did security for a lot of the ammunition movements from the ports to where they had to go and then also um we did I had a training mission which was the which was the the fun one for me it was being able to go and train the the Kuwaiti army on you know marksmanship um basic you know how to clear building uh what do you do if you're dealing with like a civil disturbance or a riot I I believe George Bush as well and that like their like what is going like how is this possible and had he continued his campaign at a certain point Ross Perot dropped out of the race and then jumped back in a little bit later and he took a big hit for that I don't know people probably like want like do not know what you want or like what what are you doing buddy but there are political pundits who say that if he had continued on he you know who knows he may have become president or he may have posed a more serious threat in the end than he did ultimately his numbers took a dive after he re-enter the race and he ended up kind of just being the perennial third party guy who stole votes right We had a lot of, you know, there's a lot of kids in the neighborhood and we, you know, oftentimes like my mom was the head cook at the restaurant and so she'd go in it like two in the morning to start cooking, we'd go in with my sister and I'd go with my dad a little later on, we do school in the office with him and then spend the rest of the day, like either wiping tables or hanging out with customers and just talking story and and like that that was a little bit of a second home for us, you know, did gymnastics, did martial arts, did did all the things and, you know, there was no, there was no, I don't know, separation or anything like that. I I'd had to fundraising as a huge thing because I needed to be able to have the resources to let people know I existed and who I am first of all just my name period and then to let them know you know my experience in my background and why why I was wanting to serve them in Congress and so you know we started out we started out just like putting signs up around the district and hoping that that would cause for people to say who's Tulsi Gabbard like what what is this about and and and it was it was a lot of time going and doing what what I called the most extensive job interview ever where I went and traveled to each island and spent a lot of time in communities with individuals with groups small groups large groups introducing myself to them and answering their questions and letting them know why I wanted to serve them in Congress what kind of leadership I would bring where I stood on on different issues that they cared about and ultimately what happened was five months before election day I went through an accelerated National Guard OCS in Alabama at Fort McClullin that uses the same program of instruction as the Fort Bending Program but just condenses it down to I think it was maybe ten weeks and the like the difference is like they get weekends off at Fort Bending like they get to use computers and phones and like that and we got none of that it was it was seven days a week you know for am to midnight all operators like no access to technology whatsoever so everything you were doing it was like you're writing it you're writing your your six-page operator yourself and you know it sucked as you're going through it of course I chose to take that public course of action because I had just gone through days of internal discussions Q&A expressions of concern and essentially expressed all of those same points of opposition internally to members of the administration and saw that nothing was nothing was breaking through and that the answers that they were delivering were pretty candid and set and that there was not really there there was not really an interest of a discussion or a response like of introspection saying hey maybe we're missing something here and and or maybe we're not communicating clearly or you know that it was just like this is it this is what we're doing and the why like why what what are you trying to accomplish well we need to send a message okay send a message and then what like you can like communications a two-way street I can send you a message but if if I want that message to be effective like I need to anticipate how you might respond and so there was I chose the course of action that that I chose purely because I felt I had exhausted internal or maybe kind of back channel means of addressing those concerns. we're going to fix it we're going to change it I'm for change I'm going to make things it seems like we are right for that I was going to ask you will we reach a tipping point it seems like we're already there Trump was the guy that got elected based on saying hey we're going to drain the swamp people voted for him to go and do that like you said people that you knew that didn't agree with any of his politics but he was changed he was different he was going to throw it in the face of the system that's where you're ready for and it just so happens at the guy that threw it in the face of the system also threw it in the face of everybody that was around him I mean just like a grenade going off it's just people are getting hit and there's no direction to it and I ended up running for I'd getting elected to the Honolulu City Council and focusing on those pot holes and you know trash and sewers and parks and and law enforcement for two years until my former boss Senator Akaka retired from the US Senator announced he was retiring and the one of the members of Congress said that she was going to run for his seat which left the vacancy in the house and ultimately that's that's where I made the decision I made the decision to run knowing that specifically in the United States Congress I would be exactly where I needed to be to try to influence and impact those decisions was it a tough campaign I mean it's incredibly tough who are you going against there were six people who ran you know it's strong democratic state so the the real election is the primary election and there were six people who were running in that democratic primary but the main person who was kind of the assumed winner of the election even you know nine months out from the election was a guy who had just run for and lost a race for governor but who was also the former mayor of of the city and county of Honolulu and so you know just for some perspective our state has about 1.4 million population around 980,000 of which live on a wall and the district that we were running for there's there's two members of Congress from Hawaii one is kind of the urban representative that that has almost the whole South Shore of Oahu the urban that kind of density urban populated area and then the other member of Congress which was the seat that I was running for has the west side nor shore and east side of Oahu and all of the neighbor islands and so I came into this with I think it was about 2% known name recognition in that district because my city council district was actually in the other it was in the urban part of Oahu so there was again no overlap in those districts and the guy the another front runner in the race he had everybody in the state knew who he was he also had a little bit of baggage that came with having just been the mayor and that's a whole other whole other conversation So at some point the somebody come in to somebody come from the outside that's not as brash and not as offensive as Trump and would that not be pretty would that not be easier or was it because he's so brash and because he's so freaking quotable right good or bad you know he's just going to run they're going to put they're going to put his quotes up all day long if somebody comes along that's from the outside but that is actually less brash and more calm and more rational do they say okay it seems like that would be the the perfect candidate right now someone from the outside that can actually roll in and say look this system is totally screwed up we're going to like the the idea of draining the swamp was a great quote that's got so many legs or so much legs and you know of course it didn't really happen when you look this administration it was like and I think I think that my announcement was on a Saturday whatever day it was they changed their schedule for when they were going to publish the article so that it came out on the day that they knew I'd be announcing my candidacy and there's thing is like the Russians like Tulsi that's the that's the general and you know like Russian bots are like you know Russians state sponsored media or the thing was is you know oh hey like let's dig deeper into this issue which is clearly very serious no none of that it was like well you know what do you think about this candidate what do you think about Trump or what do you think about this like superficial drama um and a conscious choice away from actually talking about what mattered most and ended you know Hillary Clinton weighed in on the thing when when she said that I forget the exact words but basically the Russians have chosen their candidate and without saying my name said it was me and that was then covered by the media insessantly which is like crazy and I noticed right away at the north gate of that camp at least at that time I don't know if it's still there but there was a big there's a big huge sign that someone had put up on you know that you would see every time you leave camp out through the north gate which is where most of our patrols use that gate that the sign red is today the day and I just remember being stopped in my tracks and just take it a minute to to to to take that in and the meaning of it so that none of us would ever forget that today could be the day and that that was the welcome message and it really it hit home so much in in that daily task that I had of actually seeing names of people who I never knew people in different parts of of of of of serving different parts of the country but also people who I did know whose names would pop up on that list every single day that I went through and recognizing again how precious life is and any any any any any moment you know that that could be your last and then of course we we had unfortunately you know we lost a lot of people during that deployment and to me it yeah I that that's exactly right and in order to do that it's it's being able to have not lost your foundation and your ground in this so that you have the ability to be introspective and to know what actually matters versus the things that that that don't really matter which help you determine you know which battles am I going to pick to fight and also what what is what is winning how do you define winning is it is it a specific title or is it a specific position or when you say do the right things for the right reasons and at some point in time sooner or later you're going to win for me in my case that that's that is 100% true I think what maybe maybe is not obvious to people is winning is not becoming president of the United States winning is not becoming a United States senator or a member of congress or an ambassador or whatever pick pick the job pick the crappy job you have a different perspective than most people in Washington who live their lives from college to try to strategically plan their lives to get these jobs except for the fact that you know winning you know look if you're the president you have a massive you have the most amount of influence that you could possibly have I used to tell that to these young seal officers it's about okay here here here are the here are the potential ramifications to this and sometimes they are known and sometimes they are an unknown factor but ultimately these major decision points that I have come across do the right thing if you don't if you don't know and you're not sure and all these it like ultimately do the right thing because it's the right thing and even even as you may get you know the you know the political fire or the the negative consequences or these other things like ultimately whether it takes a little time or it takes a long time doing the right thing is always the right thing Yeah, no, so it sounds like there was balance and, and you know, working at a restaurant, that's what I should have put that together because when you're working at a restaurant, you got customers, you got people, people that are happy, people that are sad, people that are mad, people that are going to tell you to, you know, go screw yourself and that you're sandwiched suck, then people that are like, oh, this is wonderful and you get all those people. and they're saying that like nice knowing you have a good after life and even even some Democrats who who had um like endorsed Obama over Hillary in 2008 early like from the beginning and who shared like hey like uh I made that decision and I was on the Clint shit list for years before I was able to dig myself out of it and tell see don't you know that she's gonna win um yeah you know stop and be like hey you know so would imagine if someone had like something you know some thing they want to address they they wouldn't hesitate to stop because you're right there it happened most recently um I was out surfing the reef near the mokulu islands and the east side of oahu and the surf there only goes off like it's only really good when there's no wind and there's swell obviously and it's it's a long why but I would think that on a matter like this you would want to have I don't know maybe the national security director so I'm sorry like I don't know somebody but that was that was essentially the message is how dare you not only has a Democrat but because like you're from the president's home state how could you how could you so publicly disagree with him on something but the thing was Jaco is is nowhere in that conversation was the substance of the issue raised like hey here's why we think your opposition is misplaced or here's what you're not seeing or here's what nothing and I'd read books and do my martial arts and yoga and just do do my thing and so to then put choose to put myself in a position where I'd have to learn how to give speeches I'd have to figure out how to pick up the phone and call total strangers which was anxiety inducing in and of itself but not only do that but ask them like hey would you like to donate to my campaign for a state house to then go like I would never forget the first day I went to go knock on doors like I knew enough about I'd done enough research to know okay if I'm going to run for this seat I'm going to run to win and in order to do that I have to convince this many people to vote for me in order to win this race and that was one of those that was one of those big decision points that I had where I couldn't I couldn't map out what the actual consequences to that decision would be so you knew I knew I knew I obviously knew it was it was a serious decision that would have serious implications but exactly what those implications would be I didn't I didn't know I had different political advisors and people who you know who knew Washington and who knew me giving me very serious warning and just saying what tells you this could be the end of the political road for you potentially so just know that before you make this decision and just just to back up a little bit why the the backstory that led to my making that decision was I was still Vice Chair of the DNC at that point and as an officer of the DNC the rules say you have to be neutral in a primary election that the DNC's role is to make sure that the primary election process is executed in a fair in a fair way so that voters have the opportunity to make their decision on who they would like to be the Democratic nominee to become the president of states and so that was my like we're here in Congress is why we are here and there were some easy kind of very simple common sense corrections that we could make it through legislation to this bill that are no brainers like not not controversial at all common sense no brainers exact okay sounds good good set of I like it and how that work out it turns out that both party leadership indirectly expressed opposition to this idea and what we were talking about doing on the democratic side because it would require that they would have to admit that the bill had some flaws that needed fixing and on the Republicans I'd opposed to it because if you fix Obamacare then what do you run against what do you criticize the other side for if you actually fix it in a way that it it helps people and if people start to like it then you can't raise money off of it and you can't weaponize it for political purposes and that's that was 2013 and unfortunately here we are in 2021 and it has only progressively escalated and gotten far worse far divisive to the point where as we sit here today you have the speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi referring to Republicans as quote unquote the enemy within the enemy within and the implications of that like the actual legitimate implications of that where is when you make that statement that you do not trust people from the opposing party so wait North Korea has these capabilities they're continually increasing this threat is real there is no shelter like if we get attacked then it's kind of it's game over what what's being done about this by the leaders and that none of that happened at all even in the aftermath of something that was you know terrifying and in such a real way and so to be able to address these issues and and the existential threat that we face that comes from that continued advancement towards the the brink of nuclear war that that that we're on and if elected to be in a position as commander and chief to begin to walk us back away from that brink and to actually do something about it to deescalate these tensions to actually work through the kinds of negotiations and treaties that previous presidents like you know Ray Yan and JFK did when they recognized the seriousness of what happens when you when you are in a cold war and when you have nuclear armed countries who either intentionally or accidentally can spark a nuclear war that would would result in the end of of humanity on this planet and that was that was the driver for me to make that decision to run and unfortunately I very quickly found out that neither the media nor the politicians were interested in talking about it or anything that really mattered that it was it was about who's saying bad things about who which candidate is you know who looks cool who's likeable who's all of these superficial things but whether it was on the debate stage when I raise these issues or in interviews with reporters one on one Like how do we start to try to solve deeper problem and and came up with an idea of going and talking elementary school kids about like, hey guys, here's why you shouldn't throw your soda can and your chip bag on the beach because this is our home, this is our playground and here's what happens when you when you do that and and I came up with like a fun little skit called the Adventures of Water Woman and a friend of mine who's an artist came up with like a workbook and a coloring book for kids and I thought elementary because you know, obviously kids are starting to figure things out and
