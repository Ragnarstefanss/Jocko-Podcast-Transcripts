and you think yourself you know what that I don't like that you need to put that so if that's your attitude and you think you're being fired up keep that goal internal don't be announcing that goal you know such state your goals and let the world know you're here no goal because you sound like an ego maniac what you should say is like you know what I want to do with this company I want to help this company grow the best I can and you know what's important to be about being in a leadership position what's important to me about being in a leadership position is making sure that the people underneath me they get better and they reach their goals this isn't about me this is about the people that are on my team So some seals were doing some training up in the area they went out and down Got into a fight and they the the guys got their ass good as seals got their ass kicked pretty much by and and it was you know Tim and I were laughing about it because again This is before the UFC was really popular and they got do a fight and of course not only is it a bunch of UFC or at least high level MMA guys that are working as bouncer so they're sober Fighting against a bunch of drunk team guys and it was funny because I they said you know because these seals got their ass As kicked and they're kind of like came back like oh man or these bouncer's were tough and then I go What where was it and they're like San Luis Obispo and then somehow through the grapevine through the MMA grapevine There somebody told me back hey, jockel those guys that got it was these guys from the pit And I don't you know, you take a skilled UFC fighter and it doesn't matter that you were a quote unquote You know Navy seal or special operations guy that's That's just not gonna happen so Now the the other kind of thing on this is If you take both people now out of the cage and you put them into a Survival type situation now the the special operations person's gonna have a much better chance Because they're first of all they're gonna be all the they're gonna try and avoid the bad situation if they can and if they do Have the fight they are much more likely to use some kind of a Improvised weapon to do some kind of sneak attack to have back up right in the form of other guys that you didn't realize We're with him and all of a sudden you're getting hit in the head of the bottle It's the professional fighter of course has a huge advantage, but There will be there is some When you get out of the cage and there's no referee there's there's some things that you know your average special operations guys It's gonna be thinking about that your normal Person wouldn't be thinking about in these situations yeah most of the bowing to the instructor in GJ2 is more like it's like bow to GJ2 almost like and that bow like bow down it's more it's like show respect like if you go to even more traditional schools even when Marango was teaching at our school you know you bow to all the instructors because they're the ones providing the GJ2 and then you bow to Helio Gracie because he's the one who kind of provide you know You know I actually want to promote you You want to fire myself for being a guy that's passing the buck and passing a responsibility or not taking ownership of anything So imagine what that looks like before you get all intimidated by taking the blame for something and think you're gonna look bad and think you're gonna get fired Think about what it looks like from the senior perspective and you actually have to imagine what it will look like Underneath you you have to see it from your perspective because it's even when you think about their perspective You still can be in fear of it. Yeah, and you really as a quote unquote customer or member, I mean, I was there, they're sure there's exceptions this, but generally you don't want that anyway, even if you think you do like I can be free to come and go and technically you are free to come and go as you as you are, but don't think that like everyone's going to be just hundred percent fine with it all the time because when when you when you come in like I said like it's a kind of a two way street, you are hopefully I hope my coach takes pride in what he taught me first. and I think there's a weird thing that happens with people that are go getters and they hear someone that's a go getter they'll hear some person that's been successful in business and that person that's been successful in business will be like you know what I said I was gonna be the best and here I am on the best and you've got to set your goals you've got to put them out there and you've got to let everyone know that you're gonna run them over if you're getting your way and that sounds really cool Because you're like, I don't, you know how like when you pump the gas, you know, and you're like, oh, I'm going to get, if you're not feeling up, you're like, I'm going to get it right on the $20 market. but that's you in being and and you'll notice that if you when you establish like solid training partners right that becomes part of the game I'm gonna try to abuse you and so that's different that's what I mean by so different like dynamic as far as like recognizing what abuse is because if you get tapped out 25 times and it seems like dang you didn't have to like go black belt on him he's a white belt I'm telling you what to do and a lot of times people gonna want that They're gonna want to hear exactly what to do in these presses situations So depending on the level of Experience that your subordinate leadership has depends on maybe how specific you're gonna get with just given commanders intent versus giving something very specific to do Both of those are the right answers if you have a good really good leader underneath you and you can just give him the intent And even let them come up with the plant cool go with that if you got somebody that needs a little more guidance give them a little bit more specific guidance Now obviously one part of that is you got to have trust You got to have trust with the with the subordinate leadership with that you're working with whether that's you working with your whole Poutine and you just got to trust your your squad leaders and your your fire team leaders right so you're not telling the truth and the person made a mistake That's and that there's no excuse for you so that's not a situation that I'm talking about and If your boss was the type of person that said yes, I'm gonna put the blame on him I would burn them alive like actually here's what really happened so I'm not talking about that type of situation But when you're doing an operational thing where there's mistakes it get made and your boss is scared to take ownership of them take ownership of Not that it you will win in the long run Now here's the part that is Crucial and critical and the most challenging part of this and that is when you step up and lead You want to make sure you aren't stepping up and stepping on Your leader you don't want to step into their little spotlight you don't want to Impose yourself in their Leadership line light and glory you don't want to do that you you can't do that You want them to get the credit you don't want to have them be intimidated by you in any way and this is hard Because when you start taking ownership for stuff It's very it can be very Intimidating for the person that's above you because they think dang this guy just he's just a bold bastard Then stepping up and taking charge of stuff You know, hey, it kind of like the email list, you know, like, oh, okay, I'll talk about it in a second, but you know, like the email list, we sign up that the insider's list and sign up. So but people ask me about these schools and I kind of give them my best guess like you know I'll take a look at the website and you know see if there's a black belt you don't need to ask me by the way Google look at their record make sure that they do Brazilian jiu-jitsu not some other form of jiu-jitsu just just you can figure it out you don't need you can go to the school and assess but what I want the main point that I wanted to bring up isn't that it's just this part here is that being into jiu-jitsu doesn't mean that a person is a good person and being a black belt in jiu-jitsu doesn't have anything to do with their character as a person and you know some of it you know with the whole school thing we just talked about where people start going crazy about who owns students right now like you know like I'm on own any students and it's really easy to get suckered into the point where you feel like you should exercise your power over other people um on the mats or otherwise you know if you if you ever go into the gym and it's making you feel really good to tap everyone out like you're feeling better than them just just start to check yourself man because that's not that's not helping you because there's someone out there that's can tap you there's someone else and if you're taking those abusive out on other people so again to be genders in jiu-jitsu you're gonna get tapped out you're gonna get tapped out a lot Hey, I got to, you know, a thousand subscribers or whatever, you know, people that are celebrating, they're posting, you like, like, why didn't you celebrate at like a thousand one or nine, I think. and I come and roll against Jeff Glover and heat and let's let's say it's a I don't know six minute round and just in training and Jeff taps him out 25 times that's not that's not abuse you know you just need to do some missions hold on you he's doing his thing or whatever if someone's like grinding you and doing you know abusing you or trying to make you look stupid or something like that I'm gonna be the best I'm gonna be the ruler of this company I'm gonna be no we don't want to hear that like when you you know you just take all I want to be the president of the United States who wants that person to be president of the United States and I sure don't I don't want that person in the president of the United States if someone says I'm gonna be the CEO of this company now what do you think of that yeah when you when you get your true tech and you set your PR in you know in like you know a while or something like this you gotta put the star there's like yes First of all I don't know all those instructors now generally you know somebody that does jiu-jitsu will look at a website and see what a guy's credentials are and say yeah that guy looks like a legit black belt or legit brown belt or even a guy asked me their day is it worth learning from a purple belt if there's no one else around him like absolutely absolutely. yeah turn them on turn them on and if they go up start to maybe ask more questions and you are and don't get yourself in a situation where you know you're going to regret what's going on because you believed that someone was a good person because they had some status that you considered to be an honorable status you know hate to say it man I hate to I hate to have to uh kind of bring that bring all that all that jiu-jitsu down in this you know there's He grabs it he closed in he's like, oh, you know, I still feel the coin in my hand kind of thing He looks he switched the coin that's kind of what your friend did with a cigarette when he shoved it in the guy's sinus cavity Because it's like super fast, you know, but precise, but you can't count on that move That's my point. I know I, like a lot of stuff I learned from you, you know, and like you're like a two, two-litch, whatever. And I'll just go ahead and broaden that out to make it like you know a special operation guy because People put special operations personnel onto a pedestal of You know totally being able to kick everyone's ass which is Well Did this to answer the question in its simplest form if the if there was a fight and It's mixed martial arts competition so like in a cage what you were just talking about with a referee Maybe like like I said get like a lucky thing or I don't know Hey, people carried lots now you're getting a different realm here. you know if you listen you know you're like oh anyway check mine if you like go grab one you can support that way and force and and Amazon click through what that it does is anytime you shop on Amazon just click through on our website docoupotcast.com or the store there's a little section there people can do a lot of Christmas and holiday shopping No, all right Kick it off Let's go to question number two Jockel what if I don't have time to explain the why to my troops for a decision I'm making during an operation U.S. Army first lieutenant so Awesome thanks for your service U.S. Army first lieutenant get some and I Talk about Troops and people in general never wanting a plan to be In post upon them and so that's that's what this question is kind of based around because I'm gonna send it up You know, you don't want to just force people to do some plan you want to say hey What do you think you should do you know you did just start jujitsu like you know a lot of us have been and so emails me and says I was gonna bring the email and read it it's like short
