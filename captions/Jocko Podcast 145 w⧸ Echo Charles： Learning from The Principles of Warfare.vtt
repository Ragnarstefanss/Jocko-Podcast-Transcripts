00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is Jocopotcast number 145.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good evening, echo. Good evening.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The primary mission of the Marine Rifle Company and Platoon is to locate, close with and destroy the enemy by fire and maneuver or to repel his assault by fire and close combat.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The primary mission of the weapons platoon of the Rifle Company is to provide supporting, direct and indirect fires, including close in anti-tank fires and demolitions for maneuvering or defending elements of the Rifle Company.

6
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Boom.

7
00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It does not get much more straightforward than that. That is taken directly from FM FM6TAC4 Marine Rifle Company.

8
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And this is a solid manual, a very solid manual, a very solid field manual.

9
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And one of the reasons that I pulled it out again, because I wanted to look at the general principles of war. And this has, so the US military, all branches talk about the principles of war as the America sees the principles of war.

10
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:40.000
For whatever reason, the FM FM6TAC4 has sort of the best descriptions of them that I like, I should say, maybe they're not the best.

11
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
They're my preferential ones, the ones that I prefer. So the principles of war pretty straightforward, but I wanted to talk about them.

12
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And this kind of led me down a little rabbit hole, which I sometimes go into when it comes to military strategies, principles, tactics.

13
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And I ended up in a place that I thought was very interesting. It kind of brought me back to something that I'd uncovered years ago.

14
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:20.000
One of those early things that started to gel my thought process started to see little little connections in the world.

15
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So it started with this, so the principles of war. So they talk about these broad principles of war. Again, everyone in the military covers these principles, everyone in the US military covers these principles of war.

16
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Here's how the Marine Corps in the Marine Rifle Company manual discusses them. Okay, principles of war. General, the principles of war are fundamental truths governing the prosecution of war.

17
00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:01.000
That's so legit. Anyways, I'm going to read that again. The principles of war are fundamental truths governing the prosecution of war.

18
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.000
There you go. The principles of war are guidelines to be used by a commander to effectively apply the combat power of the Marine Company or Paltoon to aid in the accomplishment of the assigned mission.

19
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The effective application of these principles is essential to the proper exercise of command and the conduct of war.

20
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Although combat leaders have studied the principles, it is not enough to name them in sequence, but rather to know when and how to relate them to the combat environment.

21
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:52.000
The principles of war are included here to provide a review for the commander to be used when applying doctrine contained in this manual. Now, the important part to remember is, and you're going to see this, that these principles do not only apply to war at all. In fact, they apply to everything.

22
00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:07.000
The objective of a military force is the goal or aim usually expressed as a mission for which the force was constituted.

23
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:24.000
This principle is overriding. It is applicable to any operation at any level of command. The objective of a force can be stated in either broad or precise terms, depending upon the nature of the goal.

24
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Each element of an infantry unit contributes to the attainment of the objective of the larger unit of which it is a part. For example, when the objective of a battalion has been defined, all elements of the battalion must be assigned objectives that facilitate the attainment of the battalion objective.

25
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Success in combat is measured by the accomplishment of the mission. So this is important to remember from a leadership perspective when you come up with a mission.

26
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:24.000
For your company or for your team, then the smaller teams within your team have got to redefine that mission as it applies to them and make sure that what they come up with permission is aligned with and supports the broader mission of the team. So when you own a manufacturing plant and your goal is to manufacture X amount of widgets a month, well then the people on the line, they have their little portion of that widget that they manufacture.

27
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:41.000
They have to make sure that they can fulfill their part of mission that allows you to do this overall success. Also, there's like supply people that are bringing the supplies in for the widget their goal, their mission is to provide the supplies needed to make these things.

28
00:05:41.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And so that's what it is. You've got to make sure that the mission of the subordinate units are in support of a nested inside of the broader mission. But sometimes we forget as leaders that the frontline people or the subordinate people below you and the chain of command, they might not understand that they need to do that might not happen. So you need to do it for sometimes you need to spell things out.

29
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Next, offensive. By the offensive, the commander can impose his will on the enemy, set the pace and course of battle, exploit enemy weaknesses and meet unexpected developments. Boom, be on the offensive. What do we call this? We call this default aggressive. Right. That's the that's the somewhere and I will continue to make the comparisons.

30
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Between what we talk about what I taught, what I came up with original four laws of combat and how they are intertwined with these principles.

31
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Back to the book. Even in the defensive, the commander must be alert to regain the initiative by offensive counter actions. Aggressiveness, flexibility of mind and the ability to make rapid, reasoned decisions are required to apply fully the principle of the offensive.

32
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:26.000
In defense, the commander can often best accomplish his mission by offensive action. So even when you're on defense, you should be looking to go on the offense.

33
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And there's some other definitions that talk about. This is very, very clear when you're training you to do. Have you ever trained with someone? I know you have. When you're training with someone that's constantly attacking.

34
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:47.000
That's, that's you're gonna go down. I mean you're gonna, when someone, that's how someone gets the upper hand. They're attacking here. They're attacking there. They're attacking over here. They're attacking back there again.

35
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And you're constantly on the defense defense defense defense and eventually they get the upper hand and crush you. Very clear in jujitsu. Next.

36
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Simplicity.

37
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Simplicity demands that detailed, simple plans be adopted in every military operation. It's interesting to call it a detailed and simple.

38
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It is, of course, a relative term because all actions in war are essentially complex. That's a great point.

39
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And I talk about that too. I talk about how easy it is to, like how these how a mission, hey, it's so easy to see a mission is not rocket science, right? It's not brain surgery.

40
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:38.000
You know what the bad guy is. You know where you are. You're gonna load in some helicopters or some vehicles or some boats. You're gonna go to where they are. You're gonna get them and you're gonna come back. There's the mission.

41
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
That's a little oversimplified.

42
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And it's not that much oversimplified, but you know, there's things like fuel. There's things like load, load plans. There's things about weight and how much each vehicle can carry or how much each helicopter can carry.

43
00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So there's there are the and how you're gonna put cover fire down. There's up there are more detailed things. So like the statement says, all actions in war are essentially complex and I will say,

44
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:14.000
That all actions in war are also essentially simple because what are you trying to do? You trying to close with and destroy the enemy. That's it. I've had that happen with companies where I go into a company and.

45
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:24.000
They've lost sight of the simplicity of their mission. The simplicity of their mission is to make something and they get all wrapped around all these other things.

46
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
But what you're supposed to be doing is making this thing and everything that you're doing should be lead to supporting the making of this thing.

47
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And people go down. They focus their efforts in other areas. So it's good to think about yes, there's complexities. It's it's a total dichotomy. It's a total dichotomy in business too, right. There's a total dichotomy.

48
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It's it's very complicated, but at the same time, it's actually very simple.

49
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.000
So when you feel thing is getting too complicated, that's when you take a step back and you go, okay, what is we what do we actually trying to do here. That's the question.

50
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Back to the book. Simplicity will be especially important on the nuclear battlefield.

51
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Where the full use of available means will require close control and coordination and where plans must be simple as simple as the situation will will permit.

52
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Detailed simple plans lead to coordinated timely execution. So what's interesting, the copy that I'm using of this and it's going to lead to the rest of this whole podcast, which is when we're going to start talking about the Soviets.

53
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And which goes back to the 80s. I think the day on this book on this particular version is the 80s, which is Cold War prepare for nuclear combat.

54
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000
That's that. And when you get into the Soviets and what they're thinking, you're going to see nuclear combat was absolutely part of it was part of their planning.

55
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And so same thing here, I don't even know that I have a comment about keeping your nuclear war simple. I don't know if I have a comment on that. Hey, we're going to drop bombs and everyone is going to die. I don't know how we simplify that anymore.

56
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And clearly laws of combat simplicity simple. That's one of the primary laws. That's actually law number two in my laws of combat that we put an extreme ownership.

57
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And why is that? Because I would see over and over and over again what would jam up to use your term. What would jam up a seal pollton is a complicated plan.

58
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And you would do it every single time. So you have to keep it simple. That's one of those ones before I really started diving into sort of the broad cannon of military theory.

59
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I had told everyone, hey, you got to keep it simple. You got to keep it simple. And I had been told, you know, the Vietnam guys would say, keep it simple stupid. You know, kiss.

60
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I was a little nervous that I was maybe overboard with that. And as soon as you start looking at it, keeping things simple is a broad military principle that's been around forever.

61
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And there's a reason because it's true.

62
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Next up, Unity of Command. Unity of Command is the establishment of a single authority. This is the best means of ensuring unity of effort,

63
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000
which implies a singleness of purpose and cooperation by all elements of the command.

64
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
That one seems obvious. I'll tell you what prevents this from happening. Most of the time it's ego.

65
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Most of the time in the business world, it's no one wants to say, hey, you know what? We're putting this other guy in charge.

66
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Given the support that he needs. Most of the time in the business world, well, you know, we don't want to make Billy feel bad.

67
00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So, you know what? You run this part of it, and then you run the other part of it. And then, and then, Jennifer over here, she can run this. So it's actually all three of you going to coordinate together to make this happen.

68
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Well, who's in charge? You're all in charge. How's that work out? Not good.

69
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:20.000
The only way it works out good is if one of those people or two of the three people are exquisite leaders with no egos and can prop up the other person that's an ego maniac and make them feel good and let it happen.

70
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Otherwise, it's going to be problematic. You'd see this. So in the military, what they do is they designate someone as the main effort.

71
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So, one company or one battalion will be designated, okay, you're the main effort. We're all here to support you.

72
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000
That's that's something you definitely have to be careful of. And I'll tell you, I'll give you a little hint. A little help.

73
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:55.000
The best way to do this is just to do it. The best way to do this is be like, hey, you know what? I need one person running this. So Billy, you got this one.

74
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Jennifer, I'll probably give you the next one, but Billy, you need to take command of this one. I know you know this terrain a little bit better. You run this one.

75
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Jennifer, if we go over to your your market area next time, you'll be running it. So do what you can to support Billy right now because you he'll be supporting you in the future.

76
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Boom, done. What we what people do they don't have the hard conversation. They don't want to just tell Jennifer that she needs to take the back seat on this one.

77
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
It hurts too much so they put everyone in charge and now you got no one in charge. Now you got to disaster on your hand unity command.

78
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Yeah.

79
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Next.

80
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Mass.

81
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Mass depends or sorry, mass demands that superiority of combat power be attained at the critical time and place for decisive purpose.

82
00:14:47.000 --> 00:15:04.000
This superiority is both qualitative and quantitative. Combat power is primarily a combination of firepower and maneuver, which is applied at the right time at the right place for decisive purpose.

83
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So what does this mean? Focus your efforts. This means prioritize next. This is the same thing. This is the same idea as prioritize next.

84
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Which is pick where pick what the biggest problem is and that's what you're going to attack. Focus your resources on it.

85
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Back to the book.

86
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:39.000
The use of nuclear weapons by enemy forces will require greater dispersion for passive defense. Therefore, a greater stress must be placed on the application of mass from the point of view of time rather than space.

87
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Violation of this principle exposes the command to the risk of peace meal defeat even by an inferior enemy.

88
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Let's hope we don't have nuclear war.

89
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Next, economy of force.

90
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Economy. Oh, before we get there, mass. Another way that this relates to the Gitu is that when you get an armlock, what are you doing?

91
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:24.000
You're focusing all your strength on the one weak point of the enemy. When you get a choke, what are you doing? You're focusing all your force on that one weak point of the enemy.

92
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Next, number six. Economy of force.

93
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Economy of force requires that sufficient force be applied at other than the decisive time and place to permit mass to be applied at the point of decision.

94
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000
These two principles, economy of force and mass are so closely related that they cannot be considered singly.

95
00:16:48.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Application of the two principles requires a sound estimate of what is sufficient elsewhere to permit the attainment of decisive superiority at the decisive time and place.

96
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:13.000
The efficient is the key. It canotes the application of force necessary to accomplish the purpose and not the application of as little force as possible.

97
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Economy of force. This is we heard a lot about this in judo.

98
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
When we talked about judo in depth, it's all about economy of force.

99
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Sort of the underlying principle of judo, which therefore makes it one of the underlying principles of judo.

100
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Depending on what kind of game you got, that's what it's going to say.

101
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
That's cool in theory, but you know, again on the mats, it's not going to be like that all the time.

102
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I mean, yeah, if you can perfect it, good.

103
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:50.000
But there's some people that have the kind of game where they're going to use economy of force to their advantage because they're going to wear the other person out.

104
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I would say I actually do that. I do that. I will allow people to move around and get tired.

105
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Yeah. And that's sort of a good thing for me to do.

106
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I don't do it all the time and I can't do it to everyone.

107
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Yeah. You know, I can't.

108
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
It's right now I can't really tire out Andy.

109
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
He's he's not getting tired right now.

110
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Yeah.

111
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And that's the general principle.

112
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
You know, like it's just generally that's what you're doing, whether you're perfecting it or not, generally that's what you do.

113
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:28.000
So like you know, when you're a white belt and someone mount to you or even if you mount somebody, you're like going for stuff and you're trying to get out immediately and all this stuff.

114
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
You know, brother, that's not the best time to get out. You can kind of use timing actually.

115
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I understand your point before they settle.

116
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Yeah.

117
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
The best time to get out is right when they get through it before they go by the way. That's the best time.

118
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
That's the best time to disrupt any situation.

119
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Like if you got a situation like a self defense situation, you just disrupted immediately as soon as it starts right you just poke some, you know, stick a pen in their eye and run away right you don't wait for them to grab you and you don't do that.

120
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
An active shooter situation.

121
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
You know, you don't think, oh well, I'm going to see where this is going.

122
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
No, you immediately disrupt and get out of there as fast as you can.

123
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Yeah.

124
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
You don't wait around.

125
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:16.000
So you don't let the enemy settle in their position because once they settle in their position, they're now.

126
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
They can now focus on what's happening.

127
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Well, because they're no longer having to focus on settling, right?

128
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
They've they've established position when you're fighting against the established position.

129
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
It's problematic.

130
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Yeah.

131
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And I guess, you know, maybe it's a little bit different, but technically it's in the transition.

132
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
It's like the dean does a really good job of teaching.

133
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Whereas the person gets into their final movement to get in position, he teaches where the gaps are.

134
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah.

135
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Because there are definite gaps there.

136
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Yeah.

137
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
And in the middle of a transition, for example, that's that's a huge gap, but in a way, since they don't necessarily have whatever the position they're going for like the amount.

138
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
For example, in the transition to the amount, they don't really have the amount.

139
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
So that's a huge gap, but it's not technically.

140
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:14.000
You know, escaping the amount technically because it's when you go to the other side of that transition, still in the transition, though, maybe the second half of the transition.

141
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
It's way before they settle for sure.

142
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Yeah, that's where it's going to be 100%.

143
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
But when you're a white belt, though, let's say they settle in.

144
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
And you don't want someone gets like, okay, we're going to use them out as the example.

145
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Look, guys, mounted, right?

146
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Hooks it or feet established hands, weights, established.

147
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
It's fully mounted.

148
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Point established, whatever if you're going to turn me.

149
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
And the earlier on, you're going to be trying to get out there immediately.

150
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Yeah.

151
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
And that's not economy.

152
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Oh, for sure.

153
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Because it's like, first, it's fully established.

154
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Yeah.

155
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
In fact, I'll go and tell you, you're wasting energy.

156
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Because that person is fully established.

157
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Yeah.

158
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Very lost your opportunity.

159
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Yeah.

160
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
When during that transitional period.

161
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Right.

162
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
The point there though is, in Jiu Jitsu, the more you learn, the more you kind of learn about Jiu Jitsu,

163
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
the more you realize that, yeah, that's a general purpose.

164
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Like your whole Jiu Jitsu game is economy, of course.

165
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Your whole game, you're not going to perfect it every single split second.

166
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Of your Jiu Jitsu, no.

167
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Sometimes you'll even step outside of the rule to make something specific happen.

168
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Yeah.

169
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Sometimes Dean will be like, oh, that was a spaz difference.

170
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Right.

171
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Like, I'll just get nuts for a few seconds because, you know, in hopes that opening opens up and

172
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
it'll oftentimes it does.

173
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Well, you're stronger than that guy for a second or whatever.

174
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Condoning or encouraging the spaz as the premier escape situation.

175
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Because it's not because there's plenty of times, especially against an unskilled opponent.

176
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
They can spaz all they want, they're not going anywhere.

177
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Yes.

178
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Correct.

179
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Yeah.

180
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Exactly.

181
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And I got something, you know, I talked to, uh, I was talking to Dave Burke about this.

182
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Good deal, dude.

183
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Yeah.

184
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And from a leadership perspective, there is also a

185
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
something very similar that happens from a leadership perspective.

186
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.000
As a leader, let's say, okay, when you're a black belt or a brown belt, you have someone

187
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
that's a white belt, right?

188
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
And they're, you're mounted on them.

189
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
And they're grabbing, whatever they're grabbing, they're grabbing it with full like

190
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
craziness.

191
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000
They're grabbing your belt or they're grabbing your sleeve like as hard as they possibly can.

192
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Or they're grabbing your neck.

193
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
It is no factor, right?

194
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
I mean, it's literally no factor to you.

195
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
If you make it a factor, that means just means you're not experienced enough.

196
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
That means if you're only a, if you're only a blue belt, you're going to get a lower blue belt.

197
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
And you might start getting concerned about this.

198
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
But when you're a black belt, you're like, oh, this doesn't matter.

199
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Right?

200
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.000
From a leadership perspective, there's things that are going on with your team, with individuals on your team.

201
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And if you don't know what you're doing, you're concerned about them.

202
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
And they freak you out and they make you react.

203
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
And yet if you're a black belt, these things happen, and you just, you just realize what they are.

204
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
It's just wasted energy for them.

205
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
And it's going to have no impact on the long-term deal that you're, you know where you're going.

206
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So it's a, it's a clear indicator to me when I'm working with a leader.

207
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
And they're spun up about little things.

208
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
For some reason, I always think of like, they're spun up that the person's grabbing their, they're belt.

209
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Right?

210
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
You're mounted on them and they're grabbing your belt like they're going to do something with it.

211
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
They can't do anything.

212
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
That happens all the time from a leadership perspective.

213
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Someone, you know, some of your subordinates are doing something crazy.

214
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
It's like, okay, does it really matter?

215
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Most of the time, it doesn't even matter.

216
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Yeah.

217
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Okay, so you got to address it.

218
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Like if a guy, if your guy's, if your mounted on a guy, and he starts to lift your knee,

219
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
you can reach down and address it.

220
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
No, be dealing.

221
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
You don't panic.

222
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
You don't give up the mount.

223
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Yeah.

224
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
You just address it.

225
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
And then you, you take it back to normal.

226
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
So as a, and what this has to do with really is has to do with detachment.

227
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Because you, if you're detached, you'll see that whatever this situation is, it's not that big of a deal.

228
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
But when you're all up in the fight and they're grabbing your belt, they're grabbing your sleeve and you're freaking out.

229
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
You're not doing a good job of detachment at all.

230
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Yeah.

231
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
You feel like right or up to something.

232
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I don't know what it is, but you know, I don't feel right about it.

233
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I see it all the time.

234
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
And by the way, here's another important piece.

235
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
If they're doing something, if they're grabbing your sleeve, and now you expend energy to stop that.

236
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Well, you're expending energy.

237
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
You're not following the idea of economy of force, and what you're also doing is you're giving up leadership capital.

238
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Because you're wasting time trying to stop them to from doing something that doesn't even matter.

239
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
So why are you worried about that?

240
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Let that thing go.

241
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Just let that thing go.

242
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Focus on the wrong things.

243
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Yes.

244
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Yes.

245
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
When I was a dancer, this was part of the training.

246
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
But they did call it, men the minimum.

247
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Yeah.

248
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
When you're training, especially if you've been in like breaking up a significant fight situation,

249
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
you start telling me that I got to use minimum.

250
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
It just sounds off.

251
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
I know what they mean.

252
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
And this is what they mean right here.

253
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
It's sufficient.

254
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
They mean sufficient.

255
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Yeah.

256
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
They basically, they don't want you overdoing it.

257
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Yeah.

258
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
They do mean they do mean minimum.

259
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
But they also mean sufficient.

260
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Yeah.

261
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Because if you use the minimum force required in it, works, then it was sufficient.

262
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Right.

263
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Yeah.

264
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
And I understood it one day said it, of course.

265
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Like it's a one, one, we're not in the situation.

266
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Yeah.

267
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
That's true.

268
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Technically that's true.

269
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
I like how they use sufficient though, because it one, one, you hear.

270
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.52
Especially if you're talking about warfare or in my case bouncing when you're breaking up

271
00:25:41.52 --> 00:25:47.000
guys fighting with bottles or whatever and they're saying, hey, use the minimum.

272
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
You're like, bro, no man.

273
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
We're going in there where we get it done as quick as we can.

274
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
But thing is, it's like no, bro.

275
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
But you're not going to use maximum.

276
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Yeah.

277
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
You're not going in there swinging punches.

278
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
You're breaking it up.

279
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
You know, kind of thing.

280
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
And it makes sense because guys will do that to like, oh, yeah, it's fake.

281
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
You know, kind of thing.

282
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
And then they'll like injure somebody or something like that when they don't have to.

283
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Yeah, not good.

284
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
It's efficient.

285
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
It's efficient.

286
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
It's efficient.

287
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
For us.

288
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Check.

289
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
All right.

290
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Next.

291
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Manoeuvre.

292
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Manoeuvre requires that all military resources be brought to bear in the accomplishment of the objective.

293
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Correct application of the principle of manoeuvre requires not only the full use of combat power

294
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
at the decisive time in place, but includes the movements of elements of combat power, including combat service

295
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
support to the area of operations.

296
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
That's pretty straightforward.

297
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:52.000
You have to move your people in the right positions, including the support people that need to get there to keep the logistics lines open to keep the intelligence flowing to keep the radio is working all that.

298
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Application of this principle is a function of command at all levels.

299
00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
At the highest level, it usually means the movement of men, means and supplies to an area of operations.

300
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:10.000
And at the lowest level, it means the positioning of troop units and fires to destroy the enemy.

301
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Straight forward.

302
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
That's what that one is.

303
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Next.

304
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Surprise.

305
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Surprise to connote striking the enemy when, where or in such a manner that he is unable to counter effectively.

306
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
The achievement of surprise is not necessarily dependent upon misleading the enemy as to intentions,

307
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
such as for example, concealing from him and intention of attacking.

308
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
He may know from the situation that he will be attacked.

309
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Yet, the attacker may achieve surprise by the time placed direction, size, or composition of forces or tactics employed.

310
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Yeah.

311
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
That one's pretty straightforward.

312
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
That one's pretty straightforward.

313
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
That's the difference.

314
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Really, that's the difference.

315
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
That's one of the differences between like a white belt and a blue belt.

316
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
I mean, it's actually, it's not even to blue belt yet.

317
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
You've got to be able to surprise the person.

318
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
They can't know what's coming.

319
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Injigitzu.

320
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
If they know what's coming and they know any jigitzu that are going to defend that thing.

321
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
So, surprise comes when you are baiting them with one thing and you hit them with some melts.

322
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
I've told that.

323
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I told you that story.

324
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
First, when I was like a white belt, I'd probably been trained in for like four weeks.

325
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And this seal buddy, mine, who had been training for a while, but kind of off and on.

326
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
And he was a friend of mine.

327
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
And as soon as I was training for like a week, I was like, hey, let's train.

328
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

329
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
So I was kind of roughing them up, right?

330
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Because he was training off and on.

331
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
And, but he's a good dude, a great dude.

332
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
I said to him, so after like three weeks, I said to him, you know, here's the thing.

333
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Injigitzu, you can't just do one move.

334
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
You gotta like set it up with something else.

335
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Yeah.

336
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
And the next time we rolled, he was going for a choke hard on me.

337
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
And I was like, dude, this guy's a man.

338
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
I don't want to tap to this guy.

339
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
I can't let him boom here on the water.

340
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
And I was like, whoa.

341
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

342
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Yeah, yeah.

343
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Yeah.

344
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
And I, that was the last time.

345
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
But you didn't like that.

346
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
That was awesome was he took just, he took just my words.

347
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Yeah.

348
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Of what I told him.

349
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And this guy's a freaking awesome seal.

350
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:37.000
He took just my words of what I told him and applied him to what he already knew physically about how to do a choke and how to do an arm lock.

351
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Yeah.

352
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
And he arm locked me.

353
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Yeah.

354
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Yeah, that's a surprise.

355
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Surprise.

356
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Yeah, that's a surprise.

357
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Surprise.

358
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
There you go.

359
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
This is just kind of naturally too because they're like sensor grappling movements.

360
00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Like, unless you're one of these super duper quick guys, you know, like everything's going to be more or less telegraphed, you know, if, like if I say, hey, juggle, um, if I know you love the arm lock and you know, go for arm locks.

361
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
I'm going to know that's coming.

362
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Yes, and no, I agree with you.

363
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
There's sometimes when I submit people when they completely know that it's coming.

364
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
And they can't stop it.

365
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Dean does that to me. Yeah. Well, it's like he's getting an arm lock and I can't stop him. He could say like here it comes and I'm like, oh, I know it's coming. I can feel it coming. I can feel it and I can't stop it.

366
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Yeah, but here's the thing about that technique to that's like there will this two elements that go on in here. One, there's like, okay, Dean, because we talked about this before. Yeah.

367
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Well, Dean, like he's going to say, okay, Dean, I'm the thing that the surprise came earlier.

368
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Yes.

369
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:47.000
So he got into a position where not either he was a head of you now or he's in a position where all your defenses that he knows have to comfort for you to stop him. He knows the defense and all that.

370
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
He put himself early on into a position where he can shut down those defenses before.

371
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
When he went to the point of this, he did through surprise.

372
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
He did some little movement and all of a sudden he's mounted with my arm exposed.

373
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Yes. And now I know how to get a lock.

374
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
I can't kick it out of it. Exactly. Right.

375
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:13.000
But sometimes, so sometimes you do submit people like that when they know it's coming, but you're right. You got to get that surprise movement to get it in position.

376
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:26.000
And they're also the second part is Mike, like little for lack of a better term micro surprises. So it's like, you know how it's like, hey, I'm going to go for this arm lock. And I know your arm lock is coming, but just even for like a half a second split second.

377
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
I'm going to like tip you off balance.

378
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Just for that split second, you're like, oh, your mind goes, oh, care you're just your body. You're not your mind is still on the arm. You're like, your reaction. Oh, I got to put my, you know that it's like our early movie learned and

379
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Ock bar you should do this all the time. We're, you know, the sit up sweep from the yard sit up sweep for the guard.

380
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
And when you base, you go, you go back to the triangle.

381
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Yeah. That's what you do because to base you put your arm down, you get your leg over like that, for example. Like if someone likes to do triangle,

382
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.000
you'll do it. You do that stuff to me all the time because you like the triangle and to do it. Yeah, he do these little things that you got to put your arm down just real quick.

383
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Even if you're like, yeah, just real quick. I'll just put down real quick to base or whatever and I'll put it right back into the defensive position.

384
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Like, well, that's a little micro surprise.

385
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Even though you were just in the dark, the whole time, where did that triangle come from? It's not that it's just for that little little split second.

386
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
I guess what second was my little surprise surprise. That word.

387
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Hey, back to this maneuver. Like, I feel like that's like, and I learned this from you where.

388
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:37.000
But simply, you say, hey, build the relationship right with people like you're like, hey, my boss won't listen to my input or my coworker won't, you know, listen to my strategy, which is awesome and all this.

389
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000
You're like, hey, because you're just going to state, you've got to create a relationship that I get into the position, you know.

390
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:58.000
You just got this question today. I was getting interviewed and the guy's like, you know, that guy's like, well, I mean, what happens when you see it's already it's like, it's like when someone says, well, you know, it's like, and you just want someone says, well, you know what it would do.

391
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:07.000
What does the guy does this and say, you know, you know, what happens if you get told to do something by your boss and you don't agree with it.

392
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:15.000
And he just says, do it my way anyways, right? And I'm like, well, I don't get in situations like that. Why?

393
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Because I've spent the last six months, eight months, one year building a relationship up with my boss, where when my boss tells me to do something, I don't believe it.

394
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:31.000
And I say, hey, boss, I don't know if this is a good idea. How about we do this a different way. My boss says, oh, thank you, Jo. Thank you for not allowing me to tell you to do something doesn't make sense.

395
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:45.000
So you're right, it's a preemptive, a preemptive maneuver to be in the right position so that you will not get told to do something. Now does that mean I haven't done a bunch of things that I didn't want to do leading up to that point.

396
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Yes, absolutely. That's called building leadership capital. I'm going to make my boss win over and over and over again. No one wants to hear that.

397
00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:03.000
I just got asked it when when Lafin I were out in Staten Island, guys like, you know, what can I do to lead people that are that don't want to, do what I want them to do.

398
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
It's like, man, you got to build relationships with those guys. You can't borrow orders of them. It's not going to help. It'll help for a minute.

399
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Like, they'll load that truck up, but they're looking for another job.

400
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:21.000
You know what I mean? You got relationships with these people up and down the chain of command. And you know what that is? That's maneuvering. You are correct?

401
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Yeah, that's what that was critical.

402
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Or critical, yeah, but really helpful because again, that's one of those things where you got to detach. You got to kind of step outside and be like, hey, because that is okay to build a relationship with your boss.

403
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:45.000
No one thinks like that that's the solution to the problem because directly it's kind of not even though it's probably a huge huge.

404
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Why would you say directly it's not because it straight up is well, it doesn't seem like it put it that way.

405
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Like, well, if you just think kind of, I don't know, for lack of better term linearly, like if I'm like, hey, I want to talk with a loosen to my input, right?

406
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
A direct approach to it would be like, hey, juggle, take your headphones off listen to my input. That's like a direct.

407
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.000
So if I go indirect, right? That's what I can get a build a relationship first. Then I can, it's basically adding another step.

408
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000
But that step is like this straight up requirement and the thing is this, it's not a step.

409
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.000
It's a broad underlying fundamental situation that you set up for success.

410
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Yeah. And then there's this whole thought.

411
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Because I, and I've said this on here many times to say it all the time, I built relationships with bosses that I didn't like, right?

412
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
People go, oh, well, juggle is an ascester.

413
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:50.000
And juggle is a brown nose or because you just try to build a relationship with this boss. And I always say, no, I'm not a brown nose or no, I'm not an ascester. I'm winning. I'm here to win.

414
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
That's what we're here to do.

415
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
If you know what I'm here to do, take care of my pull tune and make sure that they can have what they need to accomplish our mission to the best of our ability.

416
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:06.000
If my, if I have an antagonistic relationship with my boss, can I truly support my pull tune? The answer is no all day long.

417
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:17.000
It's not going to give me the gear that we need because he's unlike me. He's not going to give me the training that I need because he doesn't like me. So why is he going to give me what I need? He's not, but if I have a good relationship with him that I built.

418
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Then guess what he's going to do, he's going to let give me what I need to accomplish my mission. He's going to give me what I need to be the most effective pull tune we can have. Now, where does it cross the line?

419
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Where does, where does Jockel become a brown nose or an an ascester? Because we know these people exist and I'll tell you exactly where the line gets crossed.

420
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:46.000
The line gets crossed where I'm kissing my boss's ass so that I can get promoted or I can get taken care of or I can take care of myself.

421
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
If that's what game you're in, yes, you're an ascester. I don't like you because you're doing it for you.

422
00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:02.000
It's like the difference between manipulation and leadership. If you're doing, if you're influencing people so that they do something that's going to help the team and help the mission and help them, that's influence.

423
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:16.000
If you're doing something, if you're influencing or that's leadership, if you're influencing people so that you can help yourself and benefit yourself, that's, and it doesn't help the team and it doesn't help the mission, that's the manipulation.

424
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Yeah, yeah, fully. Yeah, when you go outside of the scope of like the broad goal, you know, and then we can see it by the way.

425
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Everyone can see it. Everyone can see it. Everyone can see it. Everyone can see it. And what's really jacked up or not even jacked up. What's kind of cool is if you're looking out for the boys and you're looking out for the mission and you're doing everything for there for the best for their best.

426
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:54.000
That shows through too. Yeah. And when that shows through guess what? Your people, your boss wants to take care of you because you're trying to win for him.

427
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
You know, not for you.

428
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000
So yeah, but the way you said, I mean, obviously you're not new to this concept, but you know, and you're not new to the concept of when you're in the situation.

429
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:15.000
If you don't like the person and now jockel wants me to build a good relationship with this person that I don't like or whatever, but I'm not keeping it real.

430
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
That's what you want to do.

431
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Like, for one of the like this two face guy you think I'm going to be giving him my respect, my valued coveted respect.

432
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
No, man, that's I'm I keep it real. I keep it to real.

433
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:40.000
To real to real for that. I'm not going to bow and down to that guy. You can do it. Cool. So you're going to lose. Yeah, see, but when you put it into perspective again, that perspective that you put it in, which is what I did.

434
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
What's what's interesting, just to take that to one more level.

435
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:53.000
If you're the guy that's like, hey, I got too much pride to do that. I'm not doing that. I'm not bound down to him. Okay. So you're going to lose because to me, I look, I don't just look at it like one hit like that's the end of the game.

436
00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:05.000
The game doesn't end there. The game ends when I'm on top with the big win. And you know what, my ego, my ego won't allow me to let my ego interfere with the fact that I want to win.

437
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Right, right. A big game. Yeah, the, the, okay.

438
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
I got played a long game in this one in all of them.

439
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Manuver. Yeah, a little bit of maneuver.

440
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Yeah, if you can get into a habit, like you kind of sit not surprised straight up surprised me because I forgot by the way, because it's a good thing.

441
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Because it's not as, doesn't come as natural with one of your answers at, at roll call when you were like, hey, build a relationship. Oh, like you're, you know, this person is, you know, you remember this.

442
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Yeah, you're the person didn't like, he didn't follow through as much as he should have. And because he's so good. You can't tell him anything kind of thing.

443
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Right. And then it's like, no, you got to, you can't like harp on this guy. You got to build a relationship with him.

444
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Because this is a lot of the most of the time that's the answer if you have a problem with somebody like not doing it, you know, like just like I just said, but it's the time most of the time what people think they should like, how should I confront this person.

445
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Yeah, should I care them to do what I want to do.

446
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
How can I confront them should I fire them? What's it's like, oh, you know, you should build a relationship with them.

447
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Yeah, make them understand make you understand where they're coming from. Can you lead someone that you don't understand? Not really. Here's another one. You get someone.

448
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.000
If, if you're, oh, oh, this person that works for me thinks it's all about him. What should I do?

449
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
You should make him think it's that everything's about him.

450
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.000
That's the, that's the black belt move. The black belt move is like, yeah, you're damn right. This is all about you. And here's how you're going to win.

451
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:46.000
The whole team's going to be winning because you're winning, but we don't worry about that. We're worried about if your perception is that, oh, echo echo thinks is all about him. Guess what I'm going to make echo think he's right.

452
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:54.000
And he's going to be busing his ass because it's all about him and the team is going to, we'll echo is going to win, which means the team's going to win, which means I'm going to win.

453
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Yeah.

454
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:05.000
It's a no brainer. All you got to do is step back six to eight inches from from from the front line to take a look around and see that pre far six to eight inches.

455
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:12.000
And no, this is the other thing. No one wants to hear those answers. No, no, they don't. I shouldn't say no one, but most people don't want to hear those answers.

456
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Yeah. Because the fact of the matter is, is it's your fault.

457
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Yeah.

458
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:29.000
When you're, when your person is not doing what they're supposed to be doing, it's your fault. Hey, do you get the person that just has a totally negative attitude that shouldn't be on the team? Yes, they exist. I get that.

459
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:38.000
You're responsible. It is to get rid of them. It's yours. You're the boss. If they're not that person, who's responsibility is it to get everything you can out of them? It's you, you're the boss.

460
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Yeah.

461
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
People don't like to hear that answer. No.

462
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000
It's a hard answer because you want to throw whatever, you know, all the millennials to big one, right?

463
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Yeah.

464
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Millennials are like, I'm all.

465
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Yeah.

466
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Oh, well, maybe if, maybe if you were a better leader, the millennials would be on board.

467
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Yeah.

468
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
It's a hard thing to face.

469
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:20.000
But if David Hackworth and Jim Mukayama can get draftes and Vietnam to go and risk their lives and fight the enemy and possibly get wounded or killed in a war they don't believe in, if they can do that through good leadership, I think you can get a millennial to get, get after it.

470
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Yeah. And by the way, there's a millionios getting after it everywhere. I meet them all the time. Yeah. They're not like, hey, it's good to meet you. I'm glad you're putting out word about how to be lazy.

471
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
No. They're like, I'm going to crush the world. Yeah.

472
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
They're out there. Yeah.

473
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Takes a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

474
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
What it takes, it takes leadership. That's what it takes. I'm sorry.

475
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Leadership is not easy.

476
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
People do the millennials don't want to listen. Who wants to listen?

477
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
I was more rebellious than any millennial of Matt.

478
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Let's see that. Anyways.

479
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
So, next.

480
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Security. Security provides readiness for action or counteraction and is enhanced greatly by flexibility, flexibility in mind, organization and means contributes to security.

481
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:25.000
It's attainment embraces all measures designed to avoid being surprised or interfered with seriously and the retention of freedom of action.

482
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Security is not imply undue caution and avoidance of all risks.

483
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Important. Right. Security does not imply undue caution. So, there's a dichotomy here.

484
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
It doesn't imply the avoidance of all risks.

485
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:47.000
For bold action is essential to success and war and what is bold action requires risks. Otherwise it wouldn't be bold.

486
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000
When security is provided, unexpected developments will not seriously interfere with the attainment of the mission.

487
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Check. So, got to maintain security. That makes sense.

488
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
So those are the nine principles. Those are the nine principles of war that's as they existed.

489
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Now, they also talk about and there's a debate right now.

490
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Going around of weather, whether a flexibility should be the tenth principle.

491
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Some people think it should. Some people think it shouldn't.

492
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:27.000
And then in 2011, they added some principles to joint operations.

493
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:35.000
And here are those principles. Number one is restraint to limit collateral damage and prevent unnecessary use of force.

494
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:48.000
So now we're getting into the minimum force. Right. Restraint requires careful and disciplined balancing of the need for security, the conduct of military operations and the national strategic end state.

495
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Make sense. That's where they came up with us. You have to put that minimum force. That's what that is. That's the same thing.

496
00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:09.000
And I think the key to that, they put on the end, the national strategic end state. So what does that mean? Sometimes, if you use too much violence, if you as a balancer use too much violence,

497
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:17.000
your goal of your mission as a balancer is to keep the place safe. If you use too much violence, people don't want to go there because the balancers are our assholes.

498
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.000
They're beating everyone up. That's a problem. So what's our strategic end state is that we keep this place safe.

499
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:31.000
So that's why they're talking about that. Same situation. They actually changed our name from balancers to first it was hosts.

500
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Wait, yeah, it was hosts. They're going to not bounces your hosts.

501
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And then with a change of to odd door host.

502
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
No, no, okay. They went bounceers, no, you're a dormant now. You're just a dormant.

503
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Yeah, they're like, no, door hosts fits like the personification of this place.

504
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Yeah, you know, like you're just host.

505
00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Yeah, that was a good job. It's interesting. Yeah, it's interesting though because that's a little leadership maneuver that they're doing. They're trying to, they didn't do a good job.

506
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Because you're joking about it. Right? You thought it was a joke. Well, I think the thing is I actually wasn't mad at it ultimately.

507
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
I was like that totally makes sense. Because when you think balancer, you think dive bar guys beating up guy like,

508
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:21.000
you know, bouncing these guys out the on off the wall. Roadhouse talks about minimum force though, right? Well, yeah, Dalton. What does he say? He said, be nice.

509
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Oh, that's like the rule, right? Be nice and he's like ask him to walk, but be nice.

510
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:37.000
If he doesn't walk, walk him, but be nice. If he if he still won't walk, get another guy to help you walk him and you will both be nice.

511
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:44.000
And he said, be nice until it's time to not be nice. Oh, that's super badass, right?

512
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Yeah, that's like the whole that back.

513
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Good and the whole that back that smile. That's the, like the bio, what do you call it? Not the Bible, but the movie version of the bio.

514
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000
You know how you have like what do what's the Navy seal movie going? You got it. You know, for pilot to stop gun, you know,

515
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000
yeah, I don't know if there's a seal one. Yes, the one with Charlie Sheen. Yeah, but I don't even know if that's the iconic,

516
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:17.000
not as iconic, well, answer me if he has a as roadhouse. If you're a bouncer and you watch about that's your thing. Yeah, for sure. No, it's the iconic.

517
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Bouncer. Is there even another bouncer movie? I don't know. She didn't.

518
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Because it's because it doesn't even exist. No, no, no, no.

519
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Exactly.

520
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Check.

521
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:42.000
All right. Next. This is one of the new ones, one of the new principles. Perseverance to ensure the commitment necessary to attain the national strategic end state.

522
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.000
The underlying causes of the crisis may be elusive, making it difficult to achieve decisive resolution.

523
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:57.000
The patient resolute and persistent pursuit of national goals and objectives often is essential to success.

524
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:10.000
What I don't like about that one is it kind of, it kind of says it's saying like what's the number one rule objective?

525
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Like you got to know what your mission is. You got to have an objective and this one is saying, look,

526
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:22.000
the underlying causes can be elusive, it can be difficult to achieve decisive resolution.

527
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:29.000
So I guess the theory or the principle of perseverance means we're going to continue to do this.

528
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:35.000
My problem with that is that is how do you end up then or do you end up then with a Vietnam?

529
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:43.000
We're continuing to fight even though we're not quite sure what our end state is, what our objective is, and it's so elusive that we're not sure where to go.

530
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
That one makes me a little bit hesitant.

531
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Do I believe in perseverance? Absolutely, you keep going. But as I've talked about before, don't quit.

532
00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Doesn't mean never give up on the plan that you came up with and just keep going until you freaking either die or you achieve your goal.

533
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Next, legitimacy.

534
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:19.000
To maintain legal and moral authority in the conduct of operations, legitimacy, which can be a decisive factor in operations is based on the actual and perceived legality,

535
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:26.000
morality and rightness of the actions from the various perspectives of perspectives of interested audiences.

536
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Together these 12 concepts form principles of joint operations.

537
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:40.000
I'll tell you what's interesting about legitimacy. Obviously you have to have it. You have to have moral and legal authority.

538
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:49.000
The problem I have with that is who gets to judge that because the people that you're fighting, they don't agree with what you're doing.

539
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
You're not legitimate in their eyes. So how are we coming up with that?

540
00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:06.000
I think we can, but I think we have to do that decisively and say, look, this is what we're trying to achieve. This is why.

541
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:13.000
And if there's a bunch of people debating about it, okay, we're going to hold off them until someone says, oh, you know what?

542
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
This needs to be stopped or the situation needs to end because you do need legitimacy.

543
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:24.000
And if you don't have legitimacy, you're going to have problems really truly accomplishing the mission.

544
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Yeah, and I mean, kind of in a way, I'm sure there's exceptions obviously, but in a way there's always going to be like some debate, you know,

545
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:41.000
like, like, you know, I'm going to make a generic example, but like you know, if they some turmoil in this country, because the way these people are treating these other people in this country,

546
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:52.000
boom, you have steps in and all this stuff, some, there's going to be somebody debating, hey, like that's their country, that's how they roll, you know, it's like who are we stepping and call them, you know,

547
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
tomorrow or whatever, when that's how they've been living for thousands of years.

548
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
That's my point. Yeah.

549
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
That's my point.

550
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
So yeah, who gets to make that decision?

551
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Yeah.

552
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Well, it's a tough one.

553
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Yeah, like almost like a like a global standard needs to be established, you know, that I think that's kind of this.

554
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000
And I think you, I think it is actually possible to do that. I think so too. I think it is actually possible to do that.

555
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:21.000
And I think the fact that we sometimes decide that hey, it's not our place to make that decision, like I'll give you an example, ISIS.

556
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Hey, if you're systematically raping eight-year-old, nine-year-old, ten-year-old girls and boys, you don't get to do that.

557
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
We will come and stop you.

558
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Yeah.

559
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:44.000
And if you need a documented argument for why that is, I think I don't think that'd be a problem to produce.

560
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.000
I think if you need a documented argument for that, you just made you the list as well.

561
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
We're coming after you.

562
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
I think I agree with you, sir.

563
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000
So yeah, Nazis.

564
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Yes, what?

565
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
You don't get to do that.

566
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
I think you'll, yeah.

567
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Imperial Japanese Army rolling into China, rape of Nanking.

568
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Nope, you don't get to do that.

569
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
That doesn't work.

570
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
We're not okay with that.

571
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000
You just made the list.

572
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000
We seem to have a harder time doing that.

573
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
We seem to think these days that evil doesn't exist.

574
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Yeah.

575
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
And that's wrong.

576
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
It's wrong.

577
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Next, next it talks about the application of the principles, application.

578
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000
The principles of war.

579
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000
So that's the, well, it's now the 12 principles.

580
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:41.000
But now I'm going from the new principles that were added on back to the 1984 Marine Corps Field Manual.

581
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Yeah.

582
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000
FM FM 6 tack for rifle company.

583
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Application.

584
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:57.000
The principles of war act as a checklist for the commander in order to apply combat power effectively and reduces units of vulnerability.

585
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000
A review of military history will demonstrate that those commanders who have it here.

586
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
To those principles have most often enjoyed success on the battlefield.

587
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
There you go.

588
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:15.000
I like the fact that they're taking these principles and broadly applying them to the past and saying,

589
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Look, when this happened historically, you will have victory most of the time.

590
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Mm.

591
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.000
There have been, of course, exceptions to the rule.

592
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000
However, these exceptions prove the rule that any attempt to rigidly

593
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:38.000
apply all the principles to all battlefield environments may lead to defeat.

594
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000
We got a little chapter in the dichotomy of leadership.

595
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000
It's called discipline, not rigid.

596
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Why?

597
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Because of what that just said.

598
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:58.000
The commander should recognize the need to apply the principles as flexibility as all other tactical principles.

599
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Based on the circumstances with which he is confronted.

600
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Flexibility in the application of principles is as important as flexibility in the application of combat power on the battlefield.

601
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Isn't it cool to come up with principles and then just say, yeah, you got to apply them like as needed?

602
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Yeah.

603
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000
It's interesting.

604
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.000
There's a, there's a, it shows how much you have to think as a leader.

605
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Yeah.

606
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
You have to look at things all the time and sometimes your principles get a glider back off that.

607
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
And that's kind of what we did in the dichotomy of leadership.

608
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Because can you make things too simple?

609
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Yes, you can.

610
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Covered move.

611
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
The number one principle.

612
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Can you cover and move too much?

613
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Yes, you can.

614
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Prioritize next.

615
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Can you prioritize next.

616
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Cute too much?

617
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Yes, you can.

618
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
What does that look like?

619
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000
It looks like target fixation.

620
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Yeah.

621
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
What is, what does cover move too much?

622
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Look like it looks like you're stepping on the toes of other elements.

623
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Hmm.

624
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
What is too simple?

625
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Look like you haven't covered all the contingencies.

626
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
What is too much decentralized command?

627
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Look like it looks like your people don't even know where you're exposed to be going.

628
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Because you haven't made it clear.

629
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.000
You've let him go too far.

630
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Back to the book.

631
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:21.000
No commander can rigidly follow the examples provided by doctrinal resources.

632
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:27.60
But must modify them according to his mission, the situation, and the terrain over which

633
00:55:27.60 --> 00:55:30.60
he is fighting.

634
00:55:30.60 --> 00:55:31.60
So there you go.

635
00:55:31.60 --> 00:55:36.88
Now, what was interesting is I found this in an Air Force manual.

636
00:55:36.88 --> 00:55:43.88
So that's what I covered from the FM FM 6.4, which is just really good broad principles

637
00:55:43.88 --> 00:55:46.08
of combat principles of war.

638
00:55:46.08 --> 00:55:49.88
Now what was interesting, I was looking at an Air Force to kind of get their perspective.

639
00:55:49.88 --> 00:55:52.56
More perspective, not as detailed.

640
00:55:52.56 --> 00:55:57.80
But one thing that they did was interesting was they put the other countries principles

641
00:55:57.80 --> 00:56:05.32
of war and compare them to our principles of war.

642
00:56:05.32 --> 00:56:07.80
And a lot of them are very, very close.

643
00:56:07.80 --> 00:56:12.76
But one of them that stood out was the former Soviet Union.

644
00:56:12.76 --> 00:56:18.28
And this is where we get into, I'm talking specifically about the USSR back in the day,

645
00:56:18.28 --> 00:56:20.52
back in the 80s, back in the 70s.

646
00:56:20.52 --> 00:56:23.88
This is the other superpower in the world.

647
00:56:23.88 --> 00:56:28.84
And they have some interesting theories.

648
00:56:28.84 --> 00:56:34.24
And again, there's a little chart that I found and it kind of laid out.

649
00:56:34.24 --> 00:56:42.16
So in America, we have objective in Great Britain and Australia, they say selection maintenance

650
00:56:42.16 --> 00:56:43.16
of aim.

651
00:56:43.16 --> 00:56:44.16
Right.

652
00:56:44.16 --> 00:56:46.76
So understand what your aim is.

653
00:56:46.76 --> 00:56:50.12
We have offense offensive in Great Britain, Australia.

654
00:56:50.12 --> 00:56:54.20
They have offensive action.

655
00:56:54.20 --> 00:56:58.20
We have mass, meaning we're going to use our concentration of force.

656
00:56:58.20 --> 00:57:00.000
What is Great Britain and Australia called it?

657
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.28
Constitration of force.

658
00:57:01.28 --> 00:57:03.000
We both have economy of force.

659
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000
We call it maneuver.

660
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.08
They call it flexibility.

661
00:57:06.08 --> 00:57:07.96
We call it unity of command.

662
00:57:07.96 --> 00:57:10.84
They call it cooperation, which is interesting.

663
00:57:10.84 --> 00:57:15.000
Cooperation is very similar to cover move.

664
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
We both have security.

665
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000
We both have surprise.

666
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.36
We have simplicity.

667
00:57:18.36 --> 00:57:22.84
They don't have simplicity, but they have another one called maintenance of morale, which

668
00:57:22.84 --> 00:57:26.36
is an interesting and important thing that maybe we left out.

669
00:57:26.36 --> 00:57:27.68
Why do we leave that out?

670
00:57:27.68 --> 00:57:31.08
It's an important one.

671
00:57:31.08 --> 00:57:34.28
France, they have three concentration of effort.

672
00:57:34.28 --> 00:57:35.68
That's the same as mass.

673
00:57:35.68 --> 00:57:36.68
Surprise.

674
00:57:36.68 --> 00:57:37.68
That's another one.

675
00:57:37.68 --> 00:57:41.16
And then they're last one, liberty of action, which is interesting.

676
00:57:41.16 --> 00:57:42.16
That's decentralized command.

677
00:57:42.16 --> 00:57:43.16
Right.

678
00:57:43.16 --> 00:57:45.44
We go up, make things happen.

679
00:57:45.44 --> 00:57:46.94
China.

680
00:57:46.94 --> 00:57:48.48
They have some similar ones.

681
00:57:48.48 --> 00:57:51.08
Objective, they call it selection of maintenance of them.

682
00:57:51.08 --> 00:57:53.32
Offense, they call it offensive action.

683
00:57:53.32 --> 00:57:55.92
Mass, they call it concentration of force.

684
00:57:55.92 --> 00:57:59.08
Manuver, this is an interesting one.

685
00:57:59.08 --> 00:58:02.60
Manuver, they call it initiative and flexibility.

686
00:58:02.60 --> 00:58:07.32
Again, a little bit of decentralized command sprinkled on that.

687
00:58:07.32 --> 00:58:09.68
Unity of command, they have coordination.

688
00:58:09.68 --> 00:58:12.000
They have security, they have surprise.

689
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:20.48
And their last one is morale, mobility, political mobilization, and freedom of action.

690
00:58:20.48 --> 00:58:24.72
Interesting dynamic from China.

691
00:58:24.72 --> 00:58:30.68
And then they list it out, the Soviet, the former Soviet ones.

692
00:58:30.68 --> 00:58:34.24
Because this is one of the largest armies that ever existed, this former Soviet armament.

693
00:58:34.24 --> 00:58:35.24
Army.

694
00:58:35.24 --> 00:58:39.56
And as I was reading that little little, this little chart about what the Soviets had,

695
00:58:39.56 --> 00:58:42.84
testing in correlation of force, this economy, it's efficiency of force, initiative,

696
00:58:42.84 --> 00:58:45.88
surprise, mobility, tempo.

697
00:58:45.88 --> 00:58:52.04
I was going to, I remember greeting on all the assessment of the Soviet style of warfare,

698
00:58:52.04 --> 00:58:55.000
I'm not going to do it.

699
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.84
And I remember it had some interesting takes.

700
00:58:56.84 --> 00:59:01.32
And I was able to find this field manual from the 80s.

701
00:59:01.32 --> 00:59:04.88
I want to say again, these are like from the same time period as the FM that I just read

702
00:59:04.88 --> 00:59:05.88
from the Marine Corps.

703
00:59:05.88 --> 00:59:08.64
The FM, there's updated ones, which we could cover as well.

704
00:59:08.64 --> 00:59:10.64
But these are the old school ones.

705
00:59:10.64 --> 00:59:17.16
And again, in the 80s, I mean, you wouldn't assess the Soviet Union the same now as you would

706
00:59:17.16 --> 00:59:18.52
then.

707
00:59:18.52 --> 00:59:26.04
So this, we had a manual, America had a manual called FM 100 to tack one, the Soviet Army.

708
00:59:26.04 --> 00:59:33.88
And I thought it was kind of worth reviewing some of what they talked about principles

709
00:59:33.88 --> 00:59:41.36
of war because again, this was like one of the largest standing armies in history.

710
00:59:41.36 --> 00:59:44.44
It was our major foe.

711
00:59:44.44 --> 00:59:47.48
It was well-experience from World War II.

712
00:59:47.48 --> 00:59:53.40
So figure with all that, you know, we probably could learn something from them.

713
00:59:53.40 --> 00:59:58.80
So here we go, getting into the Soviet Army a little bit and some of their principles,

714
00:59:58.80 --> 01:00:03.000
how they rolled.

715
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.44
The introduces it by saying the Soviet ground forces, this field mail describes the operations

716
01:00:07.44 --> 01:00:10.48
and tactics of Soviet general purpose ground forces.

717
01:00:10.48 --> 01:00:15.24
The content is based on information in Soviet writings and other open source literature.

718
01:00:15.24 --> 01:00:20.24
Most available information is focused on potential battle in central Europe.

719
01:00:20.24 --> 01:00:25.16
This is when this was reality focuses in the 80s.

720
01:00:25.16 --> 01:00:31.16
The Soviets believe that any future war could involve the use of nuclear weapons, and

721
01:00:31.16 --> 01:00:34.28
that the initial stage of the war will be decisive.

722
01:00:34.28 --> 01:00:35.60
This is crazy.

723
01:00:35.60 --> 01:00:43.20
Tactical nuclear weapons have been assigned at all levels from division up.

724
01:00:43.20 --> 01:00:44.60
That's crazy.

725
01:00:44.60 --> 01:00:49.88
Wait, so what does that mean everybody has no-well at the division level?

726
01:00:49.88 --> 01:00:57.72
So yes, a lot of people have no-ex...

727
01:00:57.72 --> 01:01:02.60
The Soviets have the largest and most effective array of chemical weapons and equipment

728
01:01:02.60 --> 01:01:03.60
in the world.

729
01:01:03.60 --> 01:01:09.56
They are capable of employing chemical agents from battalion level upward.

730
01:01:09.56 --> 01:01:11.32
That's crazy.

731
01:01:11.32 --> 01:01:17.68
So a battalion is like the lowest fighting unit that we have.

732
01:01:17.68 --> 01:01:23.40
It's 500, 600, maybe 700 guys, generally.

733
01:01:23.40 --> 01:01:29.64
Imagine 700 guys with an 05, this is probably a 35, 40 year old guy in charge of it.

734
01:01:29.64 --> 01:01:34.08
They got chemical weapons on the battlefield ready to employ.

735
01:01:34.08 --> 01:01:36.48
And by the way, two levels above them at the division level.

736
01:01:36.48 --> 01:01:38.08
That's what we're talking about.

737
01:01:38.08 --> 01:01:42.88
Nuclear weapons.

738
01:01:42.88 --> 01:01:44.96
Not exactly what I love.

739
01:01:44.96 --> 01:01:48.28
The Soviet front, I had to put this in here.

740
01:01:48.28 --> 01:01:52.80
The front is the largest field formation in wartime.

741
01:01:52.80 --> 01:01:57.000
It is an operational administrative unit and its size and composition can vary widely

742
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.80
depending on the mission and situation.

743
01:02:01.80 --> 01:02:08.40
Roughly equivalent to a US or NATO Army group of front could be composed of three to

744
01:02:08.40 --> 01:02:11.68
five armies with organic artillery.

745
01:02:11.68 --> 01:02:16.40
Missile air defense engineer, the reason I found that funny little layer there is I often

746
01:02:16.40 --> 01:02:19.72
refer to echelon front.

747
01:02:19.72 --> 01:02:23.96
Hopefully as the front.

748
01:02:23.96 --> 01:02:29.20
But what is also interesting, I looked up front to see if that was a commonly used, if

749
01:02:29.20 --> 01:02:34.36
to see if that definition and they didn't have it listed.

750
01:02:34.36 --> 01:02:38.60
They didn't have, this is a group, an Army group, they didn't list it that way.

751
01:02:38.60 --> 01:02:39.60
So that's interesting.

752
01:02:39.60 --> 01:02:41.60
Let me zoom to no.

753
01:02:41.60 --> 01:02:43.88
All right.

754
01:02:43.88 --> 01:02:49.68
At this time, they're saying that the Soviet ground forces were like a 1.8 to 2 million

755
01:02:49.68 --> 01:02:54.08
people and a hundred and ninety-one maneuver divisions.

756
01:02:54.08 --> 01:02:58.68
So to answer your question, a hundred and ninety-one divisions.

757
01:02:58.68 --> 01:03:03.60
And each one of those hundred and ninety-one divisions had tactical nooks.

758
01:03:03.60 --> 01:03:05.60
Get some.

759
01:03:05.60 --> 01:03:07.24
Man.

760
01:03:07.24 --> 01:03:13.40
And now we get into, so that just kind of lays out how this came together.

761
01:03:13.40 --> 01:03:21.28
Okay, the Soviet concept of war to Soviets war is a manifestation of the class struggle.

762
01:03:21.28 --> 01:03:28.56
It is an expression of the conflict between progressive forces of socialism and the reactionary

763
01:03:28.56 --> 01:03:35.40
forces of imperialistic capitalism, which they feel will ultimately be which they feel

764
01:03:35.40 --> 01:03:39.28
will be ultimately resolved in favor of socialism.

765
01:03:39.28 --> 01:03:45.60
The Soviet concept of war represents a continuation of politics, same thing that we have.

766
01:03:45.60 --> 01:03:49.16
We think of war as when politics don't work.

767
01:03:49.16 --> 01:03:52.28
That's when war happens, unfortunately.

768
01:03:52.28 --> 01:03:58.64
But yeah, reactionary forces of imperialistic capitalism.

769
01:03:58.64 --> 01:04:04.84
That is America, boy.

770
01:04:04.84 --> 01:04:10.76
That's how parts of the world view America.

771
01:04:10.76 --> 01:04:15.20
The Soviet military doctrine is officially accepted.

772
01:04:15.20 --> 01:04:19.56
The Soviet military doctrine is the officially accepted set of concepts that delineate

773
01:04:19.56 --> 01:04:24.24
the ways and means to achieve military objectives in the interest of politics.

774
01:04:24.24 --> 01:04:29.80
The formulation of Soviet military doctrine is a continuous evolutionary process based on

775
01:04:29.80 --> 01:04:32.88
number one communist ideology.

776
01:04:32.88 --> 01:04:35.40
Number two, Soviet foreign policy.

777
01:04:35.40 --> 01:04:38.04
Number three, economic and military strengths of adversaries.

778
01:04:38.04 --> 01:04:41.40
Number four, Soviet resources in geography.

779
01:04:41.40 --> 01:04:42.84
Number five, history.

780
01:04:42.84 --> 01:04:44.84
Number six, science and technology.

781
01:04:44.84 --> 01:04:50.80
Soviet military doctrine is based on an elaborate integrated system of thought.

782
01:04:50.80 --> 01:04:53.20
And then it breaks down a little bit more.

783
01:04:53.20 --> 01:04:56.48
And it kind of had to build that in there because it talks about military doctrine.

784
01:04:56.48 --> 01:05:01.88
And then it talks about military science is this study and analysis of the diverse psychological

785
01:05:01.88 --> 01:05:07.68
and material phenomena relevant to armed combat for developing practical recommendations for

786
01:05:07.68 --> 01:05:09.32
the achievement of victory in war.

787
01:05:09.32 --> 01:05:10.32
Pretty straightforward.

788
01:05:10.32 --> 01:05:14.36
But the reason I haven't said you talk about military science is because I wanted to get

789
01:05:14.36 --> 01:05:18.28
to this point which is military art and a lot of times we don't think of the Soviets.

790
01:05:18.28 --> 01:05:22.04
When you think of the Soviets, what do you think of, I know what you think.

791
01:05:22.04 --> 01:05:23.40
What do you think of when you think of the Soviets?

792
01:05:23.40 --> 01:05:24.40
Come on.

793
01:05:24.40 --> 01:05:27.36
When you think of the USSR, what do you think of?

794
01:05:27.36 --> 01:05:29.36
You're going to let me down, bro.

795
01:05:29.36 --> 01:05:30.36
What?

796
01:05:30.36 --> 01:05:31.76
I don't like the Russians.

797
01:05:31.76 --> 01:05:32.76
What do you think of?

798
01:05:32.76 --> 01:05:34.48
They're strong wrestlers.

799
01:05:34.48 --> 01:05:35.48
Okay.

800
01:05:35.48 --> 01:05:37.96
As a whole, when you think of the Russians, what do you think of?

801
01:05:37.96 --> 01:05:43.08
If you had to characterize the Russians in one individual, who would you think of?

802
01:05:43.08 --> 01:05:44.08
Stalin?

803
01:05:44.08 --> 01:05:45.08
Ah, close.

804
01:05:45.08 --> 01:05:46.88
I thought you were going to say, Drago.

805
01:05:46.88 --> 01:05:47.88
Okay.

806
01:05:47.88 --> 01:05:48.88
I've been Drago.

807
01:05:48.88 --> 01:05:49.88
I've been Drago.

808
01:05:49.88 --> 01:05:51.88
The machine, right?

809
01:05:51.88 --> 01:05:52.88
Sure.

810
01:05:52.88 --> 01:05:53.88
This is what I think of.

811
01:05:53.88 --> 01:05:54.88
You know, I think of that.

812
01:05:54.88 --> 01:05:55.88
That's what the Soviet Union is.

813
01:05:55.88 --> 01:05:58.56
It's like that, you know, no emotions, no religion.

814
01:05:58.56 --> 01:06:00.04
It's just raw.

815
01:06:00.04 --> 01:06:02.88
The machines, coal, right?

816
01:06:02.88 --> 01:06:06.28
It actually fairly accurate.

817
01:06:06.28 --> 01:06:07.28
But they go here.

818
01:06:07.28 --> 01:06:13.50
Military art is the most important and primary field within military science and is the basis

819
01:06:13.50 --> 01:06:16.20
for strategy, operational art and tactics.

820
01:06:16.20 --> 01:06:19.28
It is the theory and practice of conducting armed conflict.

821
01:06:19.28 --> 01:06:25.92
So they put this high-high respect to the art.

822
01:06:25.92 --> 01:06:30.68
Probably, just possibly higher than we do.

823
01:06:30.68 --> 01:06:31.68
You know?

824
01:06:31.68 --> 01:06:33.68
It is possible.

825
01:06:33.68 --> 01:06:34.68
All right.

826
01:06:34.68 --> 01:06:36.04
So now we get into it.

827
01:06:36.04 --> 01:06:43.16
And principles of military art, Soviet military theorists consider the following points

828
01:06:43.16 --> 01:06:46.20
to be the general principles of military art.

829
01:06:46.20 --> 01:06:48.24
So that's where I'm going with all this.

830
01:06:48.24 --> 01:06:52.68
Because to get there principles.

831
01:06:52.68 --> 01:06:57.24
They do not represent any special revelation of truth or radical departure from traditional

832
01:06:57.24 --> 01:06:58.56
military thought.

833
01:06:58.56 --> 01:07:03.28
However, by their emphasis on these particular points, Soviet military leaders reveal their

834
01:07:03.28 --> 01:07:07.88
character, the character of their military thinking and predict the basic characteristics

835
01:07:07.88 --> 01:07:11.44
of future Soviet military operations.

836
01:07:11.44 --> 01:07:16.04
According to the Soviets, their armed forces must, and here's the list.

837
01:07:16.04 --> 01:07:23.32
Will we prepare to accomplish the mission regardless of conditions under which war begins or must be conducted.

838
01:07:23.32 --> 01:07:26.20
Next, achieve surprise whenever possible.

839
01:07:26.20 --> 01:07:27.44
Sounds familiar.

840
01:07:27.44 --> 01:07:31.32
Military operations must be characterized by decisiveness and aggressiveness.

841
01:07:31.32 --> 01:07:35.16
Forces must strive continuously to seize and to hold the initiative.

842
01:07:35.16 --> 01:07:37.000
That's good information.

843
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.56
Next, make full use of all available military assets and capabilities to achieve victory.

844
01:07:43.56 --> 01:07:49.08
Next, ensure that major formations and units of all services, branches and arms affect

845
01:07:49.08 --> 01:07:53.08
through thorough and continuous coordination.

846
01:07:53.08 --> 01:07:55.88
Gotta work together, cover move.

847
01:07:55.88 --> 01:08:00.52
Select the principle, enemy objective to be seized and the best routes for attacking

848
01:08:00.52 --> 01:08:01.52
it.

849
01:08:01.52 --> 01:08:05.76
Make a decisive concentration of combat power at the correct time.

850
01:08:05.76 --> 01:08:06.76
Right?

851
01:08:06.76 --> 01:08:07.76
Same thing.

852
01:08:07.76 --> 01:08:11.60
Next, maintain continuous and reliable command and control.

853
01:08:11.60 --> 01:08:17.72
The reason that's interesting is that it's a little bit leaning toward centralized control.

854
01:08:17.72 --> 01:08:18.72
Right?

855
01:08:18.72 --> 01:08:20.16
Centralized command has to pose a decentralized command.

856
01:08:20.16 --> 01:08:22.04
But they're going to reverse that later.

857
01:08:22.04 --> 01:08:26.20
Next, be determined and decisive in achieving the assigned mission.

858
01:08:26.20 --> 01:08:29.48
Next, maintain complete security of combat operations.

859
01:08:29.48 --> 01:08:30.48
Security, right?

860
01:08:30.48 --> 01:08:31.48
Same thing.

861
01:08:31.48 --> 01:08:37.40
Next, reconstitute reserves and restore combat effectiveness as quickly as possible.

862
01:08:37.40 --> 01:08:39.04
Make sense.

863
01:08:39.04 --> 01:08:40.04
Next.

864
01:08:40.04 --> 01:08:45.24
Well, now it continues on these are general principles that apply to all three levels

865
01:08:45.24 --> 01:08:48.20
of military art, strategy, operations and tactics.

866
01:08:48.20 --> 01:08:52.80
At each of these levels, there are more specific detailed principles.

867
01:08:52.80 --> 01:09:00.40
Soviya military thought, subscribes to certain laws of war at the strategic level and principles

868
01:09:00.40 --> 01:09:05.96
of operational art and tactics which apply to the actual conduct of combat.

869
01:09:05.96 --> 01:09:07.60
So here are the laws of war.

870
01:09:07.60 --> 01:09:11.52
First, law.

871
01:09:11.52 --> 01:09:16.64
The course now, come of war, waged with unlimited employment of all means of conflict depends

872
01:09:16.64 --> 01:09:21.04
primarily on the correlation of available strictly military combatants at the beginning

873
01:09:21.04 --> 01:09:22.04
of the war.

874
01:09:22.04 --> 01:09:23.04
Second, law.

875
01:09:23.04 --> 01:09:26.52
The course and outcome of the war depend on the correlation of the military potentials

876
01:09:26.52 --> 01:09:27.52
of the combatants.

877
01:09:27.52 --> 01:09:28.52
Third, law.

878
01:09:28.52 --> 01:09:32.12
The course and outcome of war depend on its political content.

879
01:09:32.12 --> 01:09:33.12
Fourth, law.

880
01:09:33.12 --> 01:09:37.92
The course and outcome of war depend on the correlation of moral, political and psychological

881
01:09:37.92 --> 01:09:42.12
capabilities of the peoples and the armies of the combatants.

882
01:09:42.12 --> 01:09:48.36
Now, I didn't break those down because they actually do it for you in the manual.

883
01:09:48.36 --> 01:09:51.64
Here's what in simpler terms what these things mean.

884
01:09:51.64 --> 01:09:52.64
First law.

885
01:09:52.64 --> 01:09:54.44
Be prepared.

886
01:09:54.44 --> 01:09:56.80
Prepare in peace time for the next war.

887
01:09:56.80 --> 01:10:00.52
Forces in being are the decisive factors.

888
01:10:00.52 --> 01:10:05.64
The side with the most and best troops and equipment at the start of the war will win

889
01:10:05.64 --> 01:10:06.96
the war.

890
01:10:06.96 --> 01:10:11.08
That makes sense, boring and even major strategic blunders.

891
01:10:11.08 --> 01:10:12.56
Second law.

892
01:10:12.56 --> 01:10:18.68
The side which can best sustain a protracted war will win the war.

893
01:10:18.68 --> 01:10:20.12
Make sense?

894
01:10:20.12 --> 01:10:21.12
Third law.

895
01:10:21.12 --> 01:10:29.32
The higher the political stakes of a war, the longer and more violent it will be.

896
01:10:29.32 --> 01:10:32.000
That's a good one.

897
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.24
That's a good one.

898
01:10:33.24 --> 01:10:38.82
You've got to think about that one from a leadership perspective when you start getting

899
01:10:38.82 --> 01:10:41.80
involved in things that have higher stakes.

900
01:10:41.80 --> 01:10:44.40
This is when people start to step in each other in the back.

901
01:10:44.40 --> 01:10:46.36
Some people get ruthless.

902
01:10:46.36 --> 01:10:54.32
When there's more at stake, there's going to be more violence.

903
01:10:54.32 --> 01:10:55.76
We don't recognize that sometime.

904
01:10:55.76 --> 01:10:57.68
Hey, this guy's always been cool to me.

905
01:10:57.68 --> 01:11:01.20
When all of a sudden the stakes go up, all of a sudden we're getting stabbed.

906
01:11:01.20 --> 01:11:04.000
The dirt's coming out.

907
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.36
The claws come out.

908
01:11:07.36 --> 01:11:08.64
It's always interesting.

909
01:11:08.64 --> 01:11:11.52
You get to see people as real true colors, right?

910
01:11:11.52 --> 01:11:15.76
When things are at stake, when more is at stake, people's true colors come out.

911
01:11:15.76 --> 01:11:17.40
The violence occurs.

912
01:11:17.40 --> 01:11:18.40
Yeah.

913
01:11:18.40 --> 01:11:24.48
Yeah, kind of like when the detective shows up at your door, hey, let's have questions

914
01:11:24.48 --> 01:11:25.48
for you.

915
01:11:25.48 --> 01:11:26.48
I don't have time.

916
01:11:26.48 --> 01:11:30.60
Oh, we could do it here or we could go back to the station.

917
01:11:30.60 --> 01:11:32.60
All right, all right.

918
01:11:32.60 --> 01:11:34.40
Then they start revealing a little bit more.

919
01:11:34.40 --> 01:11:36.72
Then they're like, hey, they don't want to cooperate that much.

920
01:11:36.72 --> 01:11:37.72
They say this thing.

921
01:11:37.72 --> 01:11:39.80
They say, yeah, I was there, but I don't remember all this stuff.

922
01:11:39.80 --> 01:11:43.88
Then they say, well, hey, if you don't tell us the truth, you could be going to jail.

923
01:11:43.88 --> 01:11:46.20
All your freedom now the stakes go up off.

924
01:11:46.20 --> 01:11:47.76
They start talking more.

925
01:11:47.76 --> 01:11:51.84
Seems like they say, hey, your friend was he involved?

926
01:11:51.84 --> 01:11:54.80
Seems like, oh, no, no, no, no.

927
01:11:54.80 --> 01:12:00.000
If you're lying, not only do you go to jail, then raise the stakes a little bit

928
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.80
all day right on the front, no?

929
01:12:01.80 --> 01:12:04.36
When the stakes go up, yeah.

930
01:12:04.36 --> 01:12:07.20
The violence increases.

931
01:12:07.20 --> 01:12:15.96
Next fourth law, war aims must be seen as just modern war cannot be waged without public

932
01:12:15.96 --> 01:12:17.36
support.

933
01:12:17.36 --> 01:12:18.36
Very important.

934
01:12:18.36 --> 01:12:19.36
Yeah.

935
01:12:19.36 --> 01:12:21.08
Very important.

936
01:12:21.08 --> 01:12:28.20
Soviet planning and preparation for war reflect a dominant feeling that war is inevitable.

937
01:12:28.20 --> 01:12:36.36
This is not to say that the USSR wants war, but that is preparing for it continuously.

938
01:12:36.36 --> 01:12:40.68
The Soviet state is autocratic militarized and centralized.

939
01:12:40.68 --> 01:12:46.28
It's political and economic systems give priority to military requirements.

940
01:12:46.28 --> 01:12:50.92
This state allocates resources and directs production for preparation and maintenance of a

941
01:12:50.92 --> 01:12:53.32
war footing.

942
01:12:53.32 --> 01:13:01.08
The Soviet Union is prepared to exert itself at great expense to achieve its goal.

943
01:13:01.08 --> 01:13:09.96
It is a nation which through civil war, collectivization, attendant, famine, and purges

944
01:13:09.96 --> 01:13:15.36
inflicted more than 20 million deaths on its own citizens from the Russian Revolution to

945
01:13:15.36 --> 01:13:18.52
the start of World War II.

946
01:13:18.52 --> 01:13:22.92
It is a nation that endured the loss of 20 million people during World War II.

947
01:13:22.92 --> 01:13:27.28
Its tolerance for sacrifice is high.

948
01:13:27.28 --> 01:13:31.36
Yeah, that's a little something to think about.

949
01:13:31.36 --> 01:13:36.84
Now what's interesting is what's stronger.

950
01:13:36.84 --> 01:13:47.96
But the core desire and mandate for freedom that we have here.

951
01:13:47.96 --> 01:13:53.40
And actually, I can answer that question because history has answered that question.

952
01:13:53.40 --> 01:13:57.08
Freedom will win.

953
01:13:57.08 --> 01:14:04.50
Next, as the laws of war dominate strategic planning for war, so do principles of operational

954
01:14:04.50 --> 01:14:08.98
art and tactics govern the conduct of warfare within a given theater of operations.

955
01:14:08.98 --> 01:14:13.14
The popular western version of the Soviet operational and tactical principles is very

956
01:14:13.14 --> 01:14:14.14
brief.

957
01:14:14.14 --> 01:14:18.18
Objective, offense, surprise, maneuver, and mass.

958
01:14:18.18 --> 01:14:24.10
This list is not fairly characterized the basis on which Soviet military leaders plan

959
01:14:24.10 --> 01:14:26.54
and conduct operations and tactics.

960
01:14:26.54 --> 01:14:31.70
Just as they add new equipment to their forces without abandoning older equipment, the Soviets

961
01:14:31.70 --> 01:14:37.74
have modernized operational and tactical principles without fully abandoning their earlier

962
01:14:37.74 --> 01:14:38.74
ones.

963
01:14:38.74 --> 01:14:43.30
A good place to begin is with those classical principles that were taught by the Zarris to

964
01:14:43.30 --> 01:14:44.30
general staff.

965
01:14:44.30 --> 01:14:50.22
So these are the classic Russian military principles.

966
01:14:50.22 --> 01:14:51.62
Here they go.

967
01:14:51.62 --> 01:14:56.66
First, extreme exertion of force at the very beginning of the war.

968
01:14:56.66 --> 01:15:01.66
Next, simultaneous of actions.

969
01:15:01.66 --> 01:15:02.98
Next, economy of forces.

970
01:15:02.98 --> 01:15:03.98
Next, concentration.

971
01:15:03.98 --> 01:15:07.66
Next, chief objective, the enemy's army.

972
01:15:07.66 --> 01:15:08.98
Next, surprise.

973
01:15:08.98 --> 01:15:10.86
Next, unity of action.

974
01:15:10.86 --> 01:15:11.86
Preparation.

975
01:15:11.86 --> 01:15:18.78
Energetic pursuit, security, initiative, and dominance over the enemy's will.

976
01:15:18.78 --> 01:15:21.42
Strength, where the enemy is weak.

977
01:15:21.42 --> 01:15:22.42
And that's the list.

978
01:15:22.42 --> 01:15:24.42
That's the old classic list.

979
01:15:24.42 --> 01:15:25.58
And it breaks it down a little bit.

980
01:15:25.58 --> 01:15:29.50
The most significant points of this list are.

981
01:15:29.50 --> 01:15:36.90
First, he who gets to the initial battle with the most wins.

982
01:15:36.90 --> 01:15:39.02
That's Sunsu, by the way.

983
01:15:39.02 --> 01:15:43.26
The enemy must be confronted with more than one situation to deal with.

984
01:15:43.26 --> 01:15:45.26
Oh, that's it.

985
01:15:45.26 --> 01:15:47.54
That's how I got our unlocked all those years ago.

986
01:15:47.54 --> 01:15:50.78
I was dealing with that choke and there came the arm lock.

987
01:15:50.78 --> 01:15:55.94
Next, one should not be diverted by geographical objectives, but should concentrate on the

988
01:15:55.94 --> 01:15:59.74
destruction of the enemy's military forces.

989
01:15:59.74 --> 01:16:05.62
Next, detailed, exacting preparation must precede an attack.

990
01:16:05.62 --> 01:16:10.70
Design actions to preempt your opponent and keep him reacting to situations that you

991
01:16:10.70 --> 01:16:13.06
control.

992
01:16:13.06 --> 01:16:19.06
Concentrate on the enemy's weak points, rather than his strengths.

993
01:16:19.06 --> 01:16:24.66
Contemporary military, contemporary Soviet military theorists hold the nuclear weapon

994
01:16:24.66 --> 01:16:29.78
entry and other means of modern warfare have modified these principles.

995
01:16:29.78 --> 01:16:37.78
By the early 1970s, the following principles dominated Soviet operational art and tactics.

996
01:16:37.78 --> 01:16:42.26
So they made these adjustments for nuclear war.

997
01:16:42.26 --> 01:16:46.10
First, mobility and high rates of combat operations.

998
01:16:46.10 --> 01:16:50.30
Next, concentration of main efforts and the creation of superiority in forces and means

999
01:16:50.30 --> 01:16:54.10
over the enemy at decisive place and at the decisive time.

1000
01:16:54.10 --> 01:16:55.42
Next, surprising security.

1001
01:16:55.42 --> 01:16:56.70
Next, combat activeness.

1002
01:16:56.70 --> 01:16:58.74
That's a good one.

1003
01:16:58.74 --> 01:17:00.54
Combat activeness.

1004
01:17:00.54 --> 01:17:04.38
Next, preservation of the combat effectiveness of friendly forces.

1005
01:17:04.38 --> 01:17:10.82
Next, conformity to the conformity of the goal to the actual situation.

1006
01:17:10.82 --> 01:17:12.62
That's a good one.

1007
01:17:12.62 --> 01:17:17.22
conformity of the goal to the actual situation.

1008
01:17:17.22 --> 01:17:21.74
What that means is your goal can change and it can change based on the situation you're

1009
01:17:21.74 --> 01:17:22.74
in.

1010
01:17:22.74 --> 01:17:24.62
That is important.

1011
01:17:24.62 --> 01:17:29.70
And the last one is coordination, which is basically covering move.

1012
01:17:29.70 --> 01:17:35.70
Now it goes on, amelding of contemporary writings and those of the recent past, plus an

1013
01:17:35.70 --> 01:17:41.70
influence of significant classical Russian principles results in the following specific

1014
01:17:41.70 --> 01:17:49.98
Soviet principles of operational art and tactics and we go into a long list.

1015
01:17:49.98 --> 01:17:53.26
The offensive is the basic form of combat action.

1016
01:17:53.26 --> 01:17:59.22
Only by a resolute offense conducted at a high tempo and to great depth is total destruction

1017
01:17:59.22 --> 01:18:01.82
of the enemy achieved.

1018
01:18:01.82 --> 01:18:03.14
So we need to go hard.

1019
01:18:03.14 --> 01:18:04.78
We need to go fast.

1020
01:18:04.78 --> 01:18:08.86
Next, combat maneuver units must be mobile and capable of rapid movement.

1021
01:18:08.86 --> 01:18:15.22
Next, fire support, command and control and logistics must be as mobile as maneuver units.

1022
01:18:15.22 --> 01:18:16.94
That makes sense.

1023
01:18:16.94 --> 01:18:23.94
Conduct are conduct thorough and continuous reconnaissance, find the enemy's weak points.

1024
01:18:23.94 --> 01:18:26.90
Yes.

1025
01:18:26.90 --> 01:18:32.94
Perform a thorough estimate of the situation and make timely analytical decisions.

1026
01:18:32.94 --> 01:18:36.30
Be realistic.

1027
01:18:36.30 --> 01:18:41.54
Consider the mission, enemy, your own combat power, terrain, weather and light conditions

1028
01:18:41.54 --> 01:18:42.54
and time.

1029
01:18:42.54 --> 01:18:44.70
So yeah, you got to look at the situation.

1030
01:18:44.70 --> 01:18:45.70
You got to look at it.

1031
01:18:45.70 --> 01:18:50.78
Best thing about that, and you don't hear this very often, be realistic.

1032
01:18:50.78 --> 01:18:52.10
How good advice is that?

1033
01:18:52.10 --> 01:18:54.30
It's damn good advice.

1034
01:18:54.30 --> 01:18:57.14
Be realistic.

1035
01:18:57.14 --> 01:18:58.98
You don't hear that often enough.

1036
01:18:58.98 --> 01:19:04.02
Next, plan and prepare extensively and in detail.

1037
01:19:04.02 --> 01:19:05.66
That's a good idea.

1038
01:19:05.66 --> 01:19:07.78
As we know, though, you can go to the extreme with that.

1039
01:19:07.78 --> 01:19:09.94
You can overdo it.

1040
01:19:09.94 --> 01:19:14.22
The planning and conduct of an operation must involve the full coordination and cooperation of

1041
01:19:14.22 --> 01:19:16.22
all commanders involved.

1042
01:19:16.22 --> 01:19:19.42
Man, that's important.

1043
01:19:19.42 --> 01:19:23.34
If you're coming up with an operation, you got to involve the commanders that people that

1044
01:19:23.34 --> 01:19:24.78
are going to be in the operation with you.

1045
01:19:24.78 --> 01:19:27.22
You can't just send them an email of how you want it to go down.

1046
01:19:27.22 --> 01:19:30.66
That's not going to work.

1047
01:19:30.66 --> 01:19:35.22
There must be unity of command, a signal commander for every operation.

1048
01:19:35.22 --> 01:19:37.50
Boom, we already talked about that.

1049
01:19:37.50 --> 01:19:43.66
Fully orchestrate all available combat means in the coordinated cooperative combined arms

1050
01:19:43.66 --> 01:19:45.66
effort makes sense.

1051
01:19:45.66 --> 01:19:49.06
Next, deceive the enemy.

1052
01:19:49.06 --> 01:19:52.90
Attack from an unexpected direction at an unexpected time.

1053
01:19:52.90 --> 01:19:53.90
Check.

1054
01:19:53.90 --> 01:19:55.34
Use terrain in weather to your advantage.

1055
01:19:55.34 --> 01:19:56.34
Check.

1056
01:19:56.34 --> 01:19:58.22
Strike early with great force.

1057
01:19:58.22 --> 01:20:00.90
Check.

1058
01:20:00.90 --> 01:20:03.50
Constantly strive to preempt and dominate the enemy.

1059
01:20:03.50 --> 01:20:06.22
Again, I always think, when I hear that, I always think of Gigietsu and someone's getting

1060
01:20:06.22 --> 01:20:11.74
the upper hand on you and you can't dig your way out of it.

1061
01:20:11.74 --> 01:20:17.38
Attack the enemy violently and simultaneously throughout his depth.

1062
01:20:17.38 --> 01:20:22.06
Carry the battle to the enemy rear with swift penetrations by maneuver unit's fire aviation

1063
01:20:22.06 --> 01:20:27.74
airborne and hell of a bonus salts and by unconventional warfare means.

1064
01:20:27.74 --> 01:20:29.94
Be bold and decisive.

1065
01:20:29.94 --> 01:20:32.26
Seas and hold the initiative.

1066
01:20:32.26 --> 01:20:36.98
Isn't it amazing that just being aggressive goes so far?

1067
01:20:36.98 --> 01:20:40.94
If you are just getting the upper hand, I mean, if you get the upper hand, you just

1068
01:20:40.94 --> 01:20:43.62
have it and you just need to maintain it.

1069
01:20:43.62 --> 01:20:44.62
How do you maintain it?

1070
01:20:44.62 --> 01:20:48.98
It's by continuing to be aggressive and not sitting back on your haunches when you got

1071
01:20:48.98 --> 01:20:50.98
the upper hand.

1072
01:20:50.98 --> 01:20:51.98
I do that.

1073
01:20:51.98 --> 01:20:52.98
Do you just use the upper hand?

1074
01:20:52.98 --> 01:20:54.34
Sit back on your haunches or yeah?

1075
01:20:54.34 --> 01:20:56.14
Get a little bit of an advantage.

1076
01:20:56.14 --> 01:20:57.14
Relaxing.

1077
01:20:57.14 --> 01:20:58.14
Right.

1078
01:20:58.14 --> 01:21:01.26
Let a little, you know, let a little time.

1079
01:21:01.26 --> 01:21:02.26
Give that person to.

1080
01:21:02.26 --> 01:21:03.26
You know what you see?

1081
01:21:03.26 --> 01:21:04.26
Isn't MMA?

1082
01:21:04.26 --> 01:21:10.54
When somebody gets dazed and the person lets him recover takes him a minute, takes him a minute

1083
01:21:10.54 --> 01:21:13.30
and 30 seconds they don't get on that person.

1084
01:21:13.30 --> 01:21:14.30
Yeah.

1085
01:21:14.30 --> 01:21:16.62
Gotta do that.

1086
01:21:16.62 --> 01:21:23.02
Prosecuting and operation relentlessly without pause under all conditions of visibility.

1087
01:21:23.02 --> 01:21:29.82
Or NBC contamination, that's nuclear biological and chemical contamination, doesn't matter.

1088
01:21:29.82 --> 01:21:30.82
Keep going.

1089
01:21:30.82 --> 01:21:33.10
That's true.

1090
01:21:33.10 --> 01:21:35.18
The Russians.

1091
01:21:35.18 --> 01:21:40.18
This is good.

1092
01:21:40.18 --> 01:21:43.18
Keep the enemy under constant pressure and off balance.

1093
01:21:43.18 --> 01:21:44.18
Not allowed to react effectively.

1094
01:21:44.18 --> 01:21:51.58
Obviously, GJ2 fully exploit the effects of nuclear or chemical strikes with deep attacks

1095
01:21:51.58 --> 01:21:54.86
by all available forces.

1096
01:21:54.86 --> 01:21:57.94
I wonder what these guys were thinking.

1097
01:21:57.94 --> 01:22:03.50
They're thinking about how they're going to follow up the nuclear assault.

1098
01:22:03.50 --> 01:22:15.46
Bro, whenever possible achieve mass by concentrated mass nuclear or non-nuclear fires rather

1099
01:22:15.46 --> 01:22:19.50
than by massing maneuver forces.

1100
01:22:19.50 --> 01:22:24.86
What that is actually saying is instead of using your troops, use nukes instead to get

1101
01:22:24.86 --> 01:22:28.54
the upper hand.

1102
01:22:28.54 --> 01:22:30.26
Good Lord.

1103
01:22:30.26 --> 01:22:33.18
Man, how did it get to this?

1104
01:22:33.18 --> 01:22:35.78
I mean, we can look back on it now.

1105
01:22:35.78 --> 01:22:40.70
I hope, I mean, because there's obviously nukes everywhere still.

1106
01:22:40.70 --> 01:22:44.30
But man, I hope people aren't sitting around plotting right now.

1107
01:22:44.30 --> 01:22:45.54
Coming up with the tactics.

1108
01:22:45.54 --> 01:22:46.90
I mean, obviously we have to.

1109
01:22:46.90 --> 01:22:47.90
You have to.

1110
01:22:47.90 --> 01:22:49.38
You have to game it out.

1111
01:22:49.38 --> 01:22:50.38
Yeah.

1112
01:22:50.38 --> 01:22:55.74
But man, I hope we got some other avenues of approach before jumping into the walk, new

1113
01:22:55.74 --> 01:22:58.74
launches.

1114
01:22:58.74 --> 01:23:02.94
Next, if maneuver forces must be massed due so rapidly, dispersed than as soon as possible

1115
01:23:02.94 --> 01:23:04.74
after the task has been achieved.

1116
01:23:04.74 --> 01:23:06.62
Manuver first with firepower.

1117
01:23:06.62 --> 01:23:08.18
Firepower is maneuver.

1118
01:23:08.18 --> 01:23:09.18
Covered move.

1119
01:23:09.18 --> 01:23:10.18
Get some.

1120
01:23:10.18 --> 01:23:12.90
Manuver forces should attack the weakest points in the enemy defense.

1121
01:23:12.90 --> 01:23:13.90
Yes, Sunsu.

1122
01:23:13.90 --> 01:23:14.90
Thank you.

1123
01:23:14.90 --> 01:23:16.22
We agree.

1124
01:23:16.22 --> 01:23:22.62
If necessary, create weak points or holes with nukes or non-nuclear fires.

1125
01:23:22.62 --> 01:23:25.10
Bypass enemies, strong points, strike deeply, nuclear.

1126
01:23:25.10 --> 01:23:26.10
Yeah.

1127
01:23:26.10 --> 01:23:27.10
Hey, you know what?

1128
01:23:27.10 --> 01:23:29.62
We're going to create a weak point with nukes.

1129
01:23:29.62 --> 01:23:30.62
Get some.

1130
01:23:30.62 --> 01:23:32.66
That's funny to hear that.

1131
01:23:32.66 --> 01:23:34.30
How like nukes is just sort of one of the odds.

1132
01:23:34.30 --> 01:23:35.62
Just throw it out there.

1133
01:23:35.62 --> 01:23:36.94
Just throw it out there.

1134
01:23:36.94 --> 01:23:39.46
We're not talking like, hey, is anyone going to hate by the way?

1135
01:23:39.46 --> 01:23:41.86
That's the end of the world.

1136
01:23:41.86 --> 01:23:43.46
Hey, hey, Colonel.

1137
01:23:43.46 --> 01:23:45.62
Hey, Colonel, I just want to bring something up.

1138
01:23:45.62 --> 01:23:47.62
You realize that we all die when this happens.

1139
01:23:47.62 --> 01:23:48.62
Right?

1140
01:23:48.62 --> 01:23:50.30
This isn't like a good plan.

1141
01:23:50.30 --> 01:23:51.62
You're playing socks.

1142
01:23:51.62 --> 01:23:52.86
Yeah, like, hey, we got to.

1143
01:23:52.86 --> 01:23:55.10
There's a little, we got to create a weak point.

1144
01:23:55.10 --> 01:23:56.10
Right over there.

1145
01:23:56.10 --> 01:23:59.14
Hey, we should send like, like, you know, like, maybe 12 guys or something.

1146
01:23:59.14 --> 01:24:01.54
Yeah, maybe over the or we could just use their nukes over here.

1147
01:24:01.54 --> 01:24:02.54
Yeah, just a little more.

1148
01:24:02.54 --> 01:24:05.58
Or maybe I'm going to send this document to Jordan Peterson.

1149
01:24:05.58 --> 01:24:10.62
Because you know, you know, how he's all paranoid about nukes or war when he was in college.

1150
01:24:10.62 --> 01:24:13.74
And that's kind of what sent him down this path of how could we get to this situation.

1151
01:24:13.74 --> 01:24:14.74
Yeah.

1152
01:24:14.74 --> 01:24:20.50
If I just get really disturbed, it's like, hey, boss, let's check this out.

1153
01:24:20.50 --> 01:24:21.50
These guys weren't playing.

1154
01:24:21.50 --> 01:24:22.50
Yeah.

1155
01:24:22.50 --> 01:24:23.98
Yes, how we're going to create a little weakness.

1156
01:24:23.98 --> 01:24:24.98
We're going to nuk them.

1157
01:24:24.98 --> 01:24:25.98
Nukum.

1158
01:24:25.98 --> 01:24:26.98
Man.

1159
01:24:26.98 --> 01:24:29.82
Scary.

1160
01:24:29.82 --> 01:24:33.06
That's very scary.

1161
01:24:33.06 --> 01:24:36.82
Avoid frontal attacks wherever possible strike the enemy in the flanks of the rear.

1162
01:24:36.82 --> 01:24:39.14
Obviously, we're all about flanking.

1163
01:24:39.14 --> 01:24:41.06
Maintain security, real inflanks.

1164
01:24:41.06 --> 01:24:44.98
Maintain sufficient following force to assure achievement of the mission and to deal with

1165
01:24:44.98 --> 01:24:46.74
contingencies.

1166
01:24:46.74 --> 01:24:50.50
Maintain honorific uninterrupted combat support.

1167
01:24:50.50 --> 01:24:54.30
Maintain effective continuous command and control and communications.

1168
01:24:54.30 --> 01:24:56.66
That's getting a little bit, you know, that's important.

1169
01:24:56.66 --> 01:24:59.14
Sometimes I think that they were very centralized.

1170
01:24:59.14 --> 01:25:02.10
And you can see that from when they fought in Afghanistan, that they definitely had some

1171
01:25:02.10 --> 01:25:03.70
centralized command going on.

1172
01:25:03.70 --> 01:25:07.14
And the units that performed well with the units that were the most decentralized, which was

1173
01:25:07.14 --> 01:25:10.38
generally their special operations units.

1174
01:25:10.38 --> 01:25:15.46
Maintain redundant communications at higher levels, rely on audio and visual signals and

1175
01:25:15.46 --> 01:25:17.98
well-rehearsed battle drills at lower levels.

1176
01:25:17.98 --> 01:25:22.58
Staffs at every level must have equipment and skills necessary to collect and analyze information

1177
01:25:22.58 --> 01:25:24.06
quickly.

1178
01:25:24.06 --> 01:25:27.66
And the employee radio electronic combat to deprive the enemy of effective command and

1179
01:25:27.66 --> 01:25:29.98
control of his combat forces.

1180
01:25:29.98 --> 01:25:33.62
That means they're going to use jammers and whatnot.

1181
01:25:33.62 --> 01:25:35.54
And here, now this is where it's interesting.

1182
01:25:35.54 --> 01:25:40.14
So as much as I talk about centralized command, add here to the spirit and letter of a plan.

1183
01:25:40.14 --> 01:25:43.98
If the plan fails, use initiative to accomplish the mission.

1184
01:25:43.98 --> 01:25:44.98
Check.

1185
01:25:44.98 --> 01:25:45.98
That's decentralized command.

1186
01:25:45.98 --> 01:25:49.06
You can only do that if you actually know what the mission is.

1187
01:25:49.06 --> 01:25:54.22
Just be prepared to react effectively to a rapidly changing battlefield, check.

1188
01:25:54.22 --> 01:25:57.06
Develop procedures deal with numerous contingencies.

1189
01:25:57.06 --> 01:25:58.06
Check.

1190
01:25:58.06 --> 01:26:03.18
Think quickly and be decisive and resourceful in accomplishing the mission.

1191
01:26:03.18 --> 01:26:04.90
Check.

1192
01:26:04.90 --> 01:26:10.62
Conservating strength through the use of combat vehicles with collective NBC protection,

1193
01:26:10.62 --> 01:26:16.18
again, that's nuclear, biological, and chemical protection, dispersal forces, minimum combat

1194
01:26:16.18 --> 01:26:21.34
power necessary to accomplish and task the use of captured enemy equipment and effective

1195
01:26:21.34 --> 01:26:25.42
logistics.

1196
01:26:25.42 --> 01:26:26.74
And then that's the end of the list.

1197
01:26:26.74 --> 01:26:28.78
Obviously, it's a pretty broad list.

1198
01:26:28.78 --> 01:26:30.10
But very interesting.

1199
01:26:30.10 --> 01:26:31.46
You can see the parallels.

1200
01:26:31.46 --> 01:26:34.70
You can see how the same themes come up over and over again.

1201
01:26:34.70 --> 01:26:37.78
And it says this, these principles are idealistic.

1202
01:26:37.78 --> 01:26:40.38
They are what the Soviets strive to achieve.

1203
01:26:40.38 --> 01:26:44.18
They show what the Soviets would like to do, but not in all cases what they may be capable

1204
01:26:44.18 --> 01:26:45.18
of doing.

1205
01:26:45.18 --> 01:26:51.14
However, the principles serve as a basis from which any examination of Soviet operations

1206
01:26:51.14 --> 01:26:53.54
and tactics must start.

1207
01:26:53.54 --> 01:26:59.98
And again, it's just crazy to read about this.

1208
01:26:59.98 --> 01:27:02.06
Nuclear warfare implications.

1209
01:27:02.06 --> 01:27:06.42
The advent of nuclear weapons caused Soviet planners to go through a long period of

1210
01:27:06.42 --> 01:27:10.94
rethinking and revising their combined arms doctrine.

1211
01:27:10.94 --> 01:27:14.90
Modern, totally mechanized, armed forces supported in threatened by weapons that can change

1212
01:27:14.90 --> 01:27:19.58
the face of the battlefield in a matter of minutes, gave a whole new meaning to the high

1213
01:27:19.58 --> 01:27:24.06
speed combined our operations in depth.

1214
01:27:24.06 --> 01:27:30.86
When we talk about combined operations or combined arms in the military, we talk about, you

1215
01:27:30.86 --> 01:27:32.30
know, we're going to use more drugs.

1216
01:27:32.30 --> 01:27:33.30
So we're going to use our two learning.

1217
01:27:33.30 --> 01:27:34.62
We're going to use your air support.

1218
01:27:34.62 --> 01:27:37.14
We're going to use, you know, heavy machine gunfire.

1219
01:27:37.14 --> 01:27:44.50
We're going to use all those together in coordination to catch our enemy in the combined

1220
01:27:44.50 --> 01:27:46.58
arms dilemma, where there's no way to get out of it.

1221
01:27:46.58 --> 01:27:48.58
It's like checkmate.

1222
01:27:48.58 --> 01:27:49.58
Right?

1223
01:27:49.58 --> 01:27:53.58
I never ever thought about, hey, let's get them in the ultimate checkmate over here on

1224
01:27:53.58 --> 01:27:54.58
this one.

1225
01:27:54.58 --> 01:27:57.82
Bring in, bring in the tactical nukes.

1226
01:27:57.82 --> 01:28:06.74
Again, just to point out the under nuclear threatened conditions, the Soviet offensive

1227
01:28:06.74 --> 01:28:11.14
concept would have the following features avoid concentrating forces, concentrate fires,

1228
01:28:11.14 --> 01:28:12.94
but not firing weapons.

1229
01:28:12.94 --> 01:28:19.06
I tack across broader frontages on multiple access, avoid enemy strong points, probe for enemy

1230
01:28:19.06 --> 01:28:23.34
weak points penetrate where possible, commit follow on forces, wind and wear that can

1231
01:28:23.34 --> 01:28:29.94
best contribute to success, drive rapidly and deeply into the enemy rear to destroy nuclear

1232
01:28:29.94 --> 01:28:37.66
weapons and enemy forces.

1233
01:28:37.66 --> 01:28:42.62
And just to wrap this up, because I thought this was an interesting, and we're not covered

1234
01:28:42.62 --> 01:28:46.54
up on to this book, just like we barely covered any of them, Marine Corps rifle manual,

1235
01:28:46.54 --> 01:28:51.50
but norms, initiative and flexibility.

1236
01:28:51.50 --> 01:28:57.50
Soviet military doctrine includes a system of performance standards, expressed in numerical

1237
01:28:57.50 --> 01:29:04.66
forms called norms, norms defined the ideal performance in a multitude of tasks and conditions.

1238
01:29:04.66 --> 01:29:09.02
I've talked about task conditions and standards on here before.

1239
01:29:09.02 --> 01:29:14.30
They are used to determine such things as intervals, rates of march, frontages, logistics

1240
01:29:14.30 --> 01:29:18.10
requirements, fire support, and training drills.

1241
01:29:18.10 --> 01:29:22.38
Norms provide a mathematical prescription for proper action.

1242
01:29:22.38 --> 01:29:27.18
So this is where we get to, you know, I start thinking of that Soviet stereotypical, like

1243
01:29:27.18 --> 01:29:30.86
hey, we're just going to hear the numbers plug them in and that's what we're going to do.

1244
01:29:30.86 --> 01:29:36.30
They are formulated by historical analysis, training exercises, requirements, and gaming

1245
01:29:36.30 --> 01:29:37.78
models.

1246
01:29:37.78 --> 01:29:43.14
Based on norms, a given situation has an approved response.

1247
01:29:43.14 --> 01:29:47.22
The correctness of a commander's action or his troops response is often measured by there

1248
01:29:47.22 --> 01:29:52.78
adherence to the established norms for that situation.

1249
01:29:52.78 --> 01:29:56.42
The advantage of this system is that it provides a high degree of combat readiness, at

1250
01:29:56.42 --> 01:29:58.42
least in the initial stages.

1251
01:29:58.42 --> 01:30:02.42
Drills at the sub-unit level, battalion, or lower, are well-rehearsed.

1252
01:30:02.42 --> 01:30:06.26
The tactical level commander is aware and advanced of how well his troops can cope with

1253
01:30:06.26 --> 01:30:08.42
time and space factors.

1254
01:30:08.42 --> 01:30:10.06
So there's what's good about it.

1255
01:30:10.06 --> 01:30:14.54
You have everything laid out like this is what we do in these situations.

1256
01:30:14.54 --> 01:30:20.10
Back to the book, the obvious disadvantage to strict adherence to norms is the less

1257
01:30:20.10 --> 01:30:22.18
provision for the unexpected.

1258
01:30:22.18 --> 01:30:27.18
If a situation arises for which there is no established normative response, a lower-level

1259
01:30:27.18 --> 01:30:31.46
commander might find himself in peril, which I totally agree.

1260
01:30:31.46 --> 01:30:36.90
That's why I made the training super hard and crazy for the guys that I put through training

1261
01:30:36.90 --> 01:30:42.30
so that they were ready for non-normative situations.

1262
01:30:42.30 --> 01:30:46.98
The topic of initiative receives much attention in Soviet military writings when a plan

1263
01:30:46.98 --> 01:30:52.58
fails, commanders are strongly urged to use initiative as a cure-all.

1264
01:30:52.58 --> 01:30:58.46
The Soviet perception of initiative involves finding a correct solution following normative

1265
01:30:58.46 --> 01:31:00.02
patterns.

1266
01:31:00.02 --> 01:31:05.94
If the commander hears to norms and is successful, he is praised if he violates normative patterns

1267
01:31:05.94 --> 01:31:09.18
and fails, he is condemned.

1268
01:31:09.18 --> 01:31:11.42
So what kind of a decentralized command you end up with there?

1269
01:31:11.42 --> 01:31:13.50
No one wants to take any risks.

1270
01:31:13.50 --> 01:31:17.02
Success however is most important if commander solves a problem by his own devices, he is

1271
01:31:17.02 --> 01:31:18.02
loaded.

1272
01:31:18.02 --> 01:31:24.42
So that's cool, but if you're afraid that if you make a call and it doesn't go right and

1273
01:31:24.42 --> 01:31:26.46
you're going to get in trouble for that, you know what you're going to do?

1274
01:31:26.46 --> 01:31:28.06
You're not going to make a call.

1275
01:31:28.06 --> 01:31:30.06
That's what crushes your decentralized command.

1276
01:31:30.06 --> 01:31:38.14
Isn't that like a good tactic or whatever for kids where if they make an honest

1277
01:31:38.14 --> 01:31:44.34
mistake, you don't just hammer him, you know, you can correct him or whatever otherwise

1278
01:31:44.34 --> 01:31:47.78
you're not going to want to venture out and do things.

1279
01:31:47.78 --> 01:31:48.78
Totally.

1280
01:31:48.78 --> 01:31:54.30
And you have to allow your kids to make some say, I've been saying lately you've got to

1281
01:31:54.30 --> 01:32:00.18
allow your kids to brush up against the guardrails of failure without smashing them.

1282
01:32:00.18 --> 01:32:06.46
The bumps and bruises are what are what is going to make them formidable in life.

1283
01:32:06.46 --> 01:32:11.74
If they never got a bumper bruise, life's going to hit them hard and won't be conditioned

1284
01:32:11.74 --> 01:32:13.62
for it.

1285
01:32:13.62 --> 01:32:18.06
And this thing wraps up just saying these concepts are not descriptive of a rigid offensive

1286
01:32:18.06 --> 01:32:21.90
doctrine but one that is both mobile and flexible.

1287
01:32:21.90 --> 01:32:27.62
So there's a little something from the Soviet army.

1288
01:32:27.62 --> 01:32:33.02
And obviously like I said, the principles of warfare, while their nuance and their state

1289
01:32:33.02 --> 01:32:36.46
are differently, they're the same.

1290
01:32:36.46 --> 01:32:39.86
I mean, you see the same patterns over and over again and they apply to war and they apply

1291
01:32:39.86 --> 01:32:41.98
to life.

1292
01:32:41.98 --> 01:32:45.66
And so I think it's important to see them from different angles so that you can understand

1293
01:32:45.66 --> 01:32:51.58
them because if you understand them broadly, well, then you can see them in all things.

1294
01:32:51.58 --> 01:32:55.14
And if you see them in all things, then you can actually apply them in all things, which

1295
01:32:55.14 --> 01:32:57.50
is important because that's what's going to make you better.

1296
01:32:57.50 --> 01:32:59.30
It's going to make your kids who better.

1297
01:32:59.30 --> 01:33:00.50
It's going to make your business better.

1298
01:33:00.50 --> 01:33:01.78
It's going to make your team better.

1299
01:33:01.78 --> 01:33:03.06
It's going to make you a better leader.

1300
01:33:03.06 --> 01:33:07.18
It's going to make you better and it's going to make your life better.

1301
01:33:07.18 --> 01:33:10.98
And these these principles have been around for a long, long time.

1302
01:33:10.98 --> 01:33:20.78
So that's the Soviet maneuver warfare doctrine.

1303
01:33:20.78 --> 01:33:26.22
And I also recently had to do some maneuver myself.

1304
01:33:26.22 --> 01:33:27.22
Sure.

1305
01:33:27.22 --> 01:33:28.50
A little bit of maneuver.

1306
01:33:28.50 --> 01:33:35.42
And I wanted to bring it up because it's interesting, a little bit of aggression, a little

1307
01:33:35.42 --> 01:33:36.90
bit of maneuver warfare.

1308
01:33:36.90 --> 01:33:39.46
So I wrote another book.

1309
01:33:39.46 --> 01:33:41.42
And the book is called Mikey in the Dragons.

1310
01:33:41.42 --> 01:33:43.50
It's another kids book.

1311
01:33:43.50 --> 01:33:45.18
It's for younger kids.

1312
01:33:45.18 --> 01:33:48.18
Maybe a tad younger than the warrior kid crowd.

1313
01:33:48.18 --> 01:33:54.42
So we're talking like 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,ish, something like that.

1314
01:33:54.42 --> 01:34:01.42
However, like the warrior kid books, there's lessons for everyone in there.

1315
01:34:01.42 --> 01:34:02.78
Yes, there is.

1316
01:34:02.78 --> 01:34:03.78
Yeah.

1317
01:34:03.78 --> 01:34:05.58
And so what's interesting, so I wrote this book.

1318
01:34:05.58 --> 01:34:07.50
I had to have like a vision.

1319
01:34:07.50 --> 01:34:09.18
Does that sound too much?

1320
01:34:09.18 --> 01:34:12.06
Yeah, when you say it, but I did it.

1321
01:34:12.06 --> 01:34:13.06
OK.

1322
01:34:13.06 --> 01:34:15.58
I had a vision of this book.

1323
01:34:15.58 --> 01:34:17.06
What the story was, right?

1324
01:34:17.06 --> 01:34:18.06
And I wrote it.

1325
01:34:18.06 --> 01:34:20.90
The original idea just hit me.

1326
01:34:20.90 --> 01:34:22.30
And I just wrote it.

1327
01:34:22.30 --> 01:34:24.66
Like the first half of the book.

1328
01:34:24.66 --> 01:34:26.18
And then a couple weeks went by.

1329
01:34:26.18 --> 01:34:30.78
And I wasn't quite sure about the ending exactly.

1330
01:34:30.78 --> 01:34:33.02
And then one night I woke up for 3, 30 in the morning.

1331
01:34:33.02 --> 01:34:34.30
I had the whole thing rest of it.

1332
01:34:34.30 --> 01:34:38.22
And I sat down and I just wrote the rest of it.

1333
01:34:38.22 --> 01:34:40.54
It was like overflowing from my brain.

1334
01:34:40.54 --> 01:34:41.54
And I just moved it.

1335
01:34:41.54 --> 01:34:42.94
I just woke up and I wrote it.

1336
01:34:42.94 --> 01:34:44.30
It took me like two hours to finish.

1337
01:34:44.30 --> 01:34:47.18
Overflowing from your brain and your heart and your soul.

1338
01:34:47.18 --> 01:34:48.42
Yeah, I don't know about all that.

1339
01:34:48.42 --> 01:34:49.42
Come on, bro.

1340
01:34:49.42 --> 01:34:50.42
Wake up 3, 30 in the morning.

1341
01:34:50.42 --> 01:34:51.42
Come on.

1342
01:34:51.42 --> 01:34:52.42
That's like what you call it.

1343
01:34:52.42 --> 01:34:55.82
Like inspired creative genius types.

1344
01:34:55.82 --> 01:34:57.22
Yeah, I don't know about all that.

1345
01:34:57.22 --> 01:34:59.06
Come on, come on.

1346
01:34:59.06 --> 01:35:04.54
But when I got done, I realized it was something.

1347
01:35:04.54 --> 01:35:05.54
Right?

1348
01:35:05.54 --> 01:35:08.06
And it was nothing.

1349
01:35:08.06 --> 01:35:12.74
And as soon as my wife and kid, my wife and my youngest daughter woke up that day.

1350
01:35:12.74 --> 01:35:14.42
And I was like, hey, let me read this to you.

1351
01:35:14.42 --> 01:35:15.78
I never read it to him.

1352
01:35:15.78 --> 01:35:19.14
I could tell because the issues I got done reading it.

1353
01:35:19.14 --> 01:35:20.90
My daughter was like, read it again.

1354
01:35:20.90 --> 01:35:22.70
But was even funnier.

1355
01:35:22.70 --> 01:35:26.10
My wife was looking at me.

1356
01:35:26.10 --> 01:35:32.94
And the look on her face was basically a look of like, I can't believe that you

1357
01:35:32.94 --> 01:35:34.14
actually wrote that.

1358
01:35:34.14 --> 01:35:35.38
She looked real suspect.

1359
01:35:35.38 --> 01:35:39.86
And I was like, you know, I was waiting for it.

1360
01:35:39.86 --> 01:35:41.58
I was like, oh, where'd you find that?

1361
01:35:41.58 --> 01:35:43.42
Yeah, right there.

1362
01:35:43.42 --> 01:35:44.42
Right.

1363
01:35:44.42 --> 01:35:45.42
And I saw it.

1364
01:35:45.42 --> 01:35:46.58
I actually did write it.

1365
01:35:46.58 --> 01:35:52.54
And I read it to one of my sealed buddies who's got a really monotone voice.

1366
01:35:52.54 --> 01:35:55.22
But he's got young kids and I'm awesome friends with him.

1367
01:35:55.22 --> 01:35:57.02
And I got done with it.

1368
01:35:57.02 --> 01:35:58.78
And I was like, looking at it as I was looking.

1369
01:35:58.78 --> 01:35:59.78
I'm reading it.

1370
01:35:59.78 --> 01:36:00.78
I'm not looking at him.

1371
01:36:00.78 --> 01:36:01.78
I'm looking at it.

1372
01:36:01.78 --> 01:36:02.78
Right.

1373
01:36:02.78 --> 01:36:03.78
And I get done.

1374
01:36:03.78 --> 01:36:04.78
And he's got this classic monotone voice.

1375
01:36:04.78 --> 01:36:09.66
And he's like, how did you even do that?

1376
01:36:09.66 --> 01:36:11.34
And I was like, okay.

1377
01:36:11.34 --> 01:36:14.06
So that's kind of, you know, he was stoked on it.

1378
01:36:14.06 --> 01:36:15.38
And then I read it to you.

1379
01:36:15.38 --> 01:36:16.86
And well, you heard it.

1380
01:36:16.86 --> 01:36:17.86
Mikey in the dragons.

1381
01:36:17.86 --> 01:36:18.86
Yeah.

1382
01:36:18.86 --> 01:36:22.30
And when I first read it to you, you read me when it wasn't even done yet.

1383
01:36:22.30 --> 01:36:23.30
Oh.

1384
01:36:23.30 --> 01:36:25.10
And it was like, I was like, dang, I was in first.

1385
01:36:25.10 --> 01:36:26.94
I kind of want a superficial level.

1386
01:36:26.94 --> 01:36:30.14
I was impressed with your ability to actually rhyme stuff.

1387
01:36:30.14 --> 01:36:31.14
Oh, that's right.

1388
01:36:31.14 --> 01:36:32.14
Because it rhymes.

1389
01:36:32.14 --> 01:36:33.90
You know, one time, like, I don't know me.

1390
01:36:33.90 --> 01:36:35.14
I'm going to bust out some rhyme.

1391
01:36:35.14 --> 01:36:36.14
I made up.

1392
01:36:36.14 --> 01:36:37.14
It's going to be so far fetched.

1393
01:36:37.14 --> 01:36:39.90
I like, right, just do better with that.

1394
01:36:39.90 --> 01:36:42.38
But yours is like, it all fits.

1395
01:36:42.38 --> 01:36:45.02
It's like, yeah, I understand how your friend was.

1396
01:36:45.02 --> 01:36:48.62
Like, how did you do that or whatever, you know, because it's just, you can't just

1397
01:36:48.62 --> 01:36:49.78
throw words together there, right?

1398
01:36:49.78 --> 01:36:50.78
But yeah.

1399
01:36:50.78 --> 01:36:54.90
So here, the first version without the ending kind of thing.

1400
01:36:54.90 --> 01:36:55.90
I read that.

1401
01:36:55.90 --> 01:36:56.90
And all of this.

1402
01:36:56.90 --> 01:36:57.90
Just the beginning.

1403
01:36:57.90 --> 01:36:59.86
And you're like, hey, there's more in there's an ending or whatever that

1404
01:36:59.86 --> 01:37:02.78
I didn't quite, you know, I was like, dang, that's that's good.

1405
01:37:02.78 --> 01:37:04.54
That is real good, actually.

1406
01:37:04.54 --> 01:37:07.50
Because you, you, you, because you always have this little message.

1407
01:37:07.50 --> 01:37:10.82
That's like real deep, you know, that kind of applies to like, you're not a little

1408
01:37:10.82 --> 01:37:11.82
nice.

1409
01:37:11.82 --> 01:37:12.82
Huge message.

1410
01:37:12.82 --> 01:37:15.18
And it like, it applies to kids directly.

1411
01:37:15.18 --> 01:37:17.98
And then it applies to adults directly though.

1412
01:37:17.98 --> 01:37:18.98
That's the thing.

1413
01:37:18.98 --> 01:37:20.62
So, you know how like, okay, so I read kids book.

1414
01:37:20.62 --> 01:37:21.62
I got kids.

1415
01:37:21.62 --> 01:37:22.62
We all know that.

1416
01:37:22.62 --> 01:37:26.86
And there's kids book, but the message is real simple message.

1417
01:37:26.86 --> 01:37:27.86
I don't know.

1418
01:37:27.86 --> 01:37:29.46
Oh, there's like a, whatever.

1419
01:37:29.46 --> 01:37:31.30
The little kid message.

1420
01:37:31.30 --> 01:37:33.78
But it's like as an adult, I'm not going to read that and be it.

1421
01:37:33.78 --> 01:37:34.78
I learned that long time ago.

1422
01:37:34.78 --> 01:37:37.10
I learned that when I was a kid.

1423
01:37:37.10 --> 01:37:41.26
But these ones, even all the way here, kid books or whatever, these are adult messages.

1424
01:37:41.26 --> 01:37:42.26
Four kids.

1425
01:37:42.26 --> 01:37:45.58
So, that's another thing I was like, dang, I was thinking that too.

1426
01:37:45.58 --> 01:37:48.06
But how do you, how do you do that?

1427
01:37:48.06 --> 01:37:49.94
And then thinking, you know what happened?

1428
01:37:49.94 --> 01:37:53.02
You were like scared of something like bugs or something when you were, that's just

1429
01:37:53.02 --> 01:37:54.02
what I was thinking in my hand.

1430
01:37:54.02 --> 01:37:55.02
I don't know.

1431
01:37:55.02 --> 01:37:56.02
Maybe you were a mepeer.

1432
01:37:56.02 --> 01:38:00.66
Anyway, so yeah, so the finished one, I think I told you through.

1433
01:38:00.66 --> 01:38:03.02
When you read the finished one, I was like, holy cow, that is gold.

1434
01:38:03.02 --> 01:38:04.02
That is gold.

1435
01:38:04.02 --> 01:38:05.02
So many levels.

1436
01:38:05.02 --> 01:38:08.30
So, what I did was I stole the story, borrowed it, put it down.

1437
01:38:08.30 --> 01:38:09.30
I borrowed it.

1438
01:38:09.30 --> 01:38:10.30
This is what you do.

1439
01:38:10.30 --> 01:38:11.30
Yeah, I know, but it works.

1440
01:38:11.30 --> 01:38:12.78
So, I borrowed the story.

1441
01:38:12.78 --> 01:38:14.06
Obviously, I can't remember I was arriving.

1442
01:38:14.06 --> 01:38:15.06
Right.

1443
01:38:15.06 --> 01:38:16.06
But I understand the story.

1444
01:38:16.06 --> 01:38:19.34
I told the story to my daughter as a bedtime story.

1445
01:38:19.34 --> 01:38:22.66
And she's like, oh, are they all these questions?

1446
01:38:22.66 --> 01:38:24.06
Because she thinks it's real.

1447
01:38:24.06 --> 01:38:25.86
But man, the lesson is so good.

1448
01:38:25.86 --> 01:38:26.86
Yeah.

1449
01:38:26.86 --> 01:38:31.38
So, well, from your reaction, from my, and I actually read it to all of my older kids as

1450
01:38:31.38 --> 01:38:32.38
well.

1451
01:38:32.38 --> 01:38:33.78
And got the same thing.

1452
01:38:33.78 --> 01:38:36.10
Super just like stoked on it.

1453
01:38:36.10 --> 01:38:38.22
And a little bit of like, did you actually write that?

1454
01:38:38.22 --> 01:38:40.78
You know, that kind of attitude.

1455
01:38:40.78 --> 01:38:44.82
And when I, when everyone kind of had the same reaction, I was like, okay, I need to get

1456
01:38:44.82 --> 01:38:48.78
this into kids hands as quickly as possible.

1457
01:38:48.78 --> 01:38:54.14
Because, you know, it's the, our typical story of a kid that, as you said, needs to overcome

1458
01:38:54.14 --> 01:38:55.70
some fears.

1459
01:38:55.70 --> 01:38:58.78
And it's also a story within a story.

1460
01:38:58.78 --> 01:38:59.78
Right.

1461
01:38:59.78 --> 01:39:03.34
So, basically, the fundamental thing is there's a boy.

1462
01:39:03.34 --> 01:39:04.82
His name is Mikey.

1463
01:39:04.82 --> 01:39:05.82
He's scared of everything.

1464
01:39:05.82 --> 01:39:07.86
That's his basic situation.

1465
01:39:07.86 --> 01:39:12.82
And here's how he gets introduced in the book.

1466
01:39:12.82 --> 01:39:13.98
It goes like this.

1467
01:39:13.98 --> 01:39:16.22
There once was a little boy named Mike.

1468
01:39:16.22 --> 01:39:18.66
And there were many things in the world that he didn't like.

1469
01:39:18.66 --> 01:39:21.50
He was scared of spiders and beetles and bugs.

1470
01:39:21.50 --> 01:39:24.10
And always thought they hit under the rugs.

1471
01:39:24.10 --> 01:39:27.58
They were creepy and crawly and nasty and mean.

1472
01:39:27.58 --> 01:39:30.42
And he ran from every bug he'd ever seen.

1473
01:39:30.42 --> 01:39:33.86
But it wasn't only insects that gave Mikey a scare.

1474
01:39:33.86 --> 01:39:37.54
There were many other things for which Mike didn't care.

1475
01:39:37.54 --> 01:39:38.54
That's sort of the opening.

1476
01:39:38.54 --> 01:39:41.06
So, you learn a little bit about Mikey's scared.

1477
01:39:41.06 --> 01:39:43.54
Scared of some stuff.

1478
01:39:43.54 --> 01:39:48.34
And eventually, after you learn about all the things that Mike he scared of and how he kind

1479
01:39:48.34 --> 01:39:54.82
of is sad that he's scared of so many things he could.

1480
01:39:54.82 --> 01:39:57.66
And he kind of wonders why is he so scared of everything.

1481
01:39:57.66 --> 01:40:01.10
And eventually he stumbles upon this book and the book is that this book that Mikey

1482
01:40:01.10 --> 01:40:03.10
calls the Dragon book.

1483
01:40:03.10 --> 01:40:04.10
Yeah.

1484
01:40:04.10 --> 01:40:08.86
And no, the book itself is called the Dragon Prince.

1485
01:40:08.86 --> 01:40:11.42
But he flips this book open for a second.

1486
01:40:11.42 --> 01:40:14.78
And he sees pictures of dragons and the dragons are crazy.

1487
01:40:14.78 --> 01:40:15.78
And so he's a little bit scared.

1488
01:40:15.78 --> 01:40:20.06
But there's also pictures of like a young boy in there that kind of looks like he knows

1489
01:40:20.06 --> 01:40:22.74
what's up.

1490
01:40:22.74 --> 01:40:24.54
And so Mike decides that he's going to read it.

1491
01:40:24.54 --> 01:40:26.86
And so this is where you get the story within the story.

1492
01:40:26.86 --> 01:40:31.46
Because then you turn the page and you see the cover to this other book.

1493
01:40:31.46 --> 01:40:33.62
Different font, different voice.

1494
01:40:33.62 --> 01:40:36.18
Different situation.

1495
01:40:36.18 --> 01:40:38.70
The pictures look a little bit different.

1496
01:40:38.70 --> 01:40:40.22
That's cool because I only saw some.

1497
01:40:40.22 --> 01:40:41.70
I didn't see the completed book.

1498
01:40:41.70 --> 01:40:45.70
I saw likes to some of the pictures and you know, those acting.

1499
01:40:45.70 --> 01:40:46.70
Yeah.

1500
01:40:46.70 --> 01:40:48.38
That's what he's doing in there.

1501
01:40:48.38 --> 01:40:52.06
And anyways, the story that's within the story is it turns out that there's this little

1502
01:40:52.06 --> 01:40:56.38
prince that lives in a kingdom where the king, who was the prince's dad, has died.

1503
01:40:56.38 --> 01:40:59.98
And of course everyone's all sad because of that.

1504
01:40:59.98 --> 01:41:03.74
But even more than being sad, they're actually scared because it was the king that always

1505
01:41:03.74 --> 01:41:11.14
protected the kingdom from the dragons who lived over the hill in the dragon cave.

1506
01:41:11.14 --> 01:41:13.78
And with the king gone, there's no one to protect the kingdom.

1507
01:41:13.78 --> 01:41:14.78
The knights are scared.

1508
01:41:14.78 --> 01:41:15.78
The guards are scared.

1509
01:41:15.78 --> 01:41:23.74
The only one that everyone is looking to to protect the kingdom is this young prince.

1510
01:41:23.74 --> 01:41:25.86
And here's how you get in, Drusu to that.

1511
01:41:25.86 --> 01:41:31.14
But now that the king had died and was gone, there was only one person to fight and carry

1512
01:41:31.14 --> 01:41:32.14
on.

1513
01:41:32.14 --> 01:41:34.50
And that person wasn't big or mighty or strong.

1514
01:41:34.50 --> 01:41:37.26
In fact, he hadn't been alive that long.

1515
01:41:37.26 --> 01:41:42.34
Now the person who had dragons to chase was just a little boy with a smiling face.

1516
01:41:42.34 --> 01:41:48.62
Yes, the person that now must stand up and be bold was just a little prince who is only

1517
01:41:48.62 --> 01:41:52.62
seven years old.

1518
01:41:52.62 --> 01:41:57.78
So the boy eventually realizes he's going to have to stand up and face the dragons.

1519
01:41:57.78 --> 01:42:02.98
He goes to his father's war chest and opens it up.

1520
01:42:02.98 --> 01:42:05.74
And of course the shield's super heavy and the sword is massive.

1521
01:42:05.74 --> 01:42:07.82
He can barely pick him up.

1522
01:42:07.82 --> 01:42:08.94
And now he's even more scared.

1523
01:42:08.94 --> 01:42:11.54
But then he sees at the bottom of the war chest.

1524
01:42:11.54 --> 01:42:18.18
He sees a little note, a little note from his dad, the king, the mighty king, and the mighty

1525
01:42:18.18 --> 01:42:22.42
king explains to the son what he has to do.

1526
01:42:22.42 --> 01:42:27.90
He's stand up and face the dragons.

1527
01:42:27.90 --> 01:42:32.42
And the notes pretty powerful in my opinion.

1528
01:42:32.42 --> 01:42:38.50
And the prince goes forth into the fray and through those lessons from his dad and he faces

1529
01:42:38.50 --> 01:42:39.74
the dragons.

1530
01:42:39.74 --> 01:42:41.50
And we get a result from that.

1531
01:42:41.50 --> 01:42:46.34
And then the original character on the story, right?

1532
01:42:46.34 --> 01:42:47.34
Mighty.

1533
01:42:47.34 --> 01:42:50.30
He learns also how to face his fears.

1534
01:42:50.30 --> 01:42:53.06
So that's the basic fundamental story.

1535
01:42:53.06 --> 01:42:55.66
And the way it came together was pretty cool.

1536
01:42:55.66 --> 01:42:57.62
And then the reactions from everyone was pretty cool.

1537
01:42:57.62 --> 01:43:00.94
So like I said, I wanted to get it into people's hands as quickly as possible.

1538
01:43:00.94 --> 01:43:03.14
So I talked to my publisher about this.

1539
01:43:03.14 --> 01:43:04.98
And I told him about it.

1540
01:43:04.98 --> 01:43:11.10
And I was in the middle of negotiating some other books with them.

1541
01:43:11.10 --> 01:43:14.74
And they of course were like, hey, we've already got these books that we're looking at.

1542
01:43:14.74 --> 01:43:17.62
So you know, we'll put this one on the back burner and maybe we'll put it out in a

1543
01:43:17.62 --> 01:43:18.62
year.

1544
01:43:18.62 --> 01:43:21.06
I was actually with those in there for 14 months.

1545
01:43:21.06 --> 01:43:22.54
You didn't like that.

1546
01:43:22.54 --> 01:43:23.54
I didn't like that.

1547
01:43:23.54 --> 01:43:26.26
So I said, no, you know, hey, it's all cool.

1548
01:43:26.26 --> 01:43:27.86
But I really want to get this one out very quickly.

1549
01:43:27.86 --> 01:43:28.70
I want to get this one out.

1550
01:43:28.70 --> 01:43:29.70
This was in the summer time.

1551
01:43:29.70 --> 01:43:31.06
I said, I want to get this one out by.

1552
01:43:31.06 --> 01:43:33.50
I want to get this one out by.

1553
01:43:33.50 --> 01:43:35.86
Let's get to get it to kids by Christmas, right?

1554
01:43:35.86 --> 01:43:37.38
This is important lesson for kids to learn.

1555
01:43:37.38 --> 01:43:38.38
Let's get it to them by Christmas.

1556
01:43:38.38 --> 01:43:39.38
Get it out.

1557
01:43:39.38 --> 01:43:40.38
November.

1558
01:43:40.38 --> 01:43:43.98
Kids can get it for Christmas and learn.

1559
01:43:43.98 --> 01:43:45.98
And they're like, no.

1560
01:43:45.98 --> 01:43:47.74
And if I go back and forth.

1561
01:43:47.74 --> 01:43:54.98
And finally the message I get is I get message from my children's publisher.

1562
01:43:54.98 --> 01:43:56.66
Because they're focused on other things.

1563
01:43:56.66 --> 01:43:57.66
It's the way it is.

1564
01:43:57.66 --> 01:44:00.78
They come back and say, look, there's no scenario.

1565
01:44:00.78 --> 01:44:05.14
No scenario where this book comes out in November.

1566
01:44:05.14 --> 01:44:07.18
There's no scenario where that happens.

1567
01:44:07.18 --> 01:44:10.38
And I said, Roger that.

1568
01:44:10.38 --> 01:44:13.58
And then I immediately formed my own publishing company.

1569
01:44:13.58 --> 01:44:14.90
I'm talking publishing.

1570
01:44:14.90 --> 01:44:16.30
I talked to John.

1571
01:44:16.30 --> 01:44:18.90
I was like, who did the art for the warrior kid books?

1572
01:44:18.90 --> 01:44:21.34
And he was like, okay, we're going.

1573
01:44:21.34 --> 01:44:23.34
This is due now.

1574
01:44:23.34 --> 01:44:27.62
And he went into a hyper creation mode.

1575
01:44:27.62 --> 01:44:31.46
And the images are a lot different to warrior kid because they're full color and they're

1576
01:44:31.46 --> 01:44:34.86
take up full pages and they're dragons and Christmas.

1577
01:44:34.86 --> 01:44:36.06
Awesomeness.

1578
01:44:36.06 --> 01:44:42.98
And he laid out the entire book and did the art and colored it in about a month and a half.

1579
01:44:42.98 --> 01:44:48.90
And now the book is in fact coming out in November.

1580
01:44:48.90 --> 01:44:53.98
So in the past when I would talk about pre-roading book with you know, so you get the first

1581
01:44:53.98 --> 01:44:54.98
edition whatnot.

1582
01:44:54.98 --> 01:44:58.94
And I would always say the publisher doesn't know needs, no how many books to print, which

1583
01:44:58.94 --> 01:44:59.94
is true.

1584
01:44:59.94 --> 01:45:03.46
Now the person, the publisher, the person that needs to know how many books to print is actually

1585
01:45:03.46 --> 01:45:05.86
me.

1586
01:45:05.86 --> 01:45:11.50
So if you want to get some, you need to order it.

1587
01:45:11.50 --> 01:45:16.34
People might think that this is done on my part, which is fine to do this.

1588
01:45:16.34 --> 01:45:19.38
It's like a lot of taking on a lot of extra work.

1589
01:45:19.38 --> 01:45:21.02
Probably won't make as much money.

1590
01:45:21.02 --> 01:45:25.66
Should have done it on the normal publishing release cycle so you can get more.

1591
01:45:25.66 --> 01:45:27.50
Like they have a whole cycle the way they're average.

1592
01:45:27.50 --> 01:45:28.50
There's a whole thing.

1593
01:45:28.50 --> 01:45:29.50
Yeah.

1594
01:45:29.50 --> 01:45:35.38
There's a whole thing to make the book more popular and all this stuff, right?

1595
01:45:35.38 --> 01:45:37.06
And I just had to look about it.

1596
01:45:37.06 --> 01:45:39.06
The bottom line is as I don't really care about that.

1597
01:45:39.06 --> 01:45:42.90
And I'll tell you what after doing book signings and you see what the warrior kid book

1598
01:45:42.90 --> 01:45:45.18
does for kids.

1599
01:45:45.18 --> 01:45:50.78
I don't care about anything but trying to get this book into as many kids hands as

1600
01:45:50.78 --> 01:45:52.58
possible.

1601
01:45:52.58 --> 01:45:56.26
If I make less money, whatever, if it doesn't make the New York Times best seller,

1602
01:45:56.26 --> 01:46:03.30
list whatever, because this isn't about making money or it isn't about making the

1603
01:46:03.30 --> 01:46:06.46
list or whatever, it's it's about these kids.

1604
01:46:06.46 --> 01:46:13.58
It's about teaching kids a core lesson at a young age so that they can have a better life.

1605
01:46:13.58 --> 01:46:15.58
Pretty straightforward.

1606
01:46:15.58 --> 01:46:17.86
Aim goal mission.

1607
01:46:17.86 --> 01:46:24.12
So if you got a kid or you know a kid or you just want to get after it and support the

1608
01:46:24.12 --> 01:46:32.74
cause over here of discipline and of justice and strength and overcoming fears because

1609
01:46:32.74 --> 01:46:35.74
that's what the book is about.

1610
01:46:35.74 --> 01:46:38.18
Then jump on Amazon or this book.

1611
01:46:38.18 --> 01:46:41.74
It's called Mikey and the Dragons.

1612
01:46:41.74 --> 01:46:46.18
And I appreciate that because it'll help a lot of kids out.

1613
01:46:46.18 --> 01:46:57.38
And that is no matter what a good thing to do in this world, no matter what kind of judgment

1614
01:46:57.38 --> 01:46:58.70
you want to put.

1615
01:46:58.70 --> 01:47:07.70
If you can help out a five year old, a seven year old, a four year old little kid, man,

1616
01:47:07.70 --> 01:47:11.18
that's worthwhile to me.

1617
01:47:11.18 --> 01:47:14.58
So Mikey and the Dragons.

1618
01:47:14.58 --> 01:47:17.02
Get some.

1619
01:47:17.02 --> 01:47:24.06
Now obviously we're going to help some kids get on the path without one.

1620
01:47:24.06 --> 01:47:27.98
Maybe Echo, you could recommend some ways to get through, you know.

1621
01:47:27.98 --> 01:47:28.98
Basically the masses.

1622
01:47:28.98 --> 01:47:31.42
Yeah, a little bit tighter on the path.

1623
01:47:31.42 --> 01:47:35.38
Yeah, can you tell me and keep us on the path really.

1624
01:47:35.38 --> 01:47:38.86
When it comes down to it, I like it.

1625
01:47:38.86 --> 01:47:42.70
So yeah, so obviously, well, it is obvious.

1626
01:47:42.70 --> 01:47:45.90
Like I said last time when we talked about origin, you know, why?

1627
01:47:45.90 --> 01:47:46.90
Cause what?

1628
01:47:46.90 --> 01:47:49.86
When you think of path, we're thinking what?

1629
01:47:49.86 --> 01:47:51.86
Fitness or how should I say capability?

1630
01:47:51.86 --> 01:47:53.58
I don't want to see fitness or whatever.

1631
01:47:53.58 --> 01:47:54.58
Whatever.

1632
01:47:54.58 --> 01:47:55.58
Not just fitness.

1633
01:47:55.58 --> 01:47:57.58
Yeah, it's like capability.

1634
01:47:57.58 --> 01:48:03.50
Which is essentially under the umbrella of capability.

1635
01:48:03.50 --> 01:48:07.18
Somebody asked me today, another interview.

1636
01:48:07.18 --> 01:48:09.98
How do you recommend men?

1637
01:48:09.98 --> 01:48:12.18
It was like one of those men's centric interviews?

1638
01:48:12.18 --> 01:48:13.42
Yeah.

1639
01:48:13.42 --> 01:48:16.78
How do you recommend men increase their confidence?

1640
01:48:16.78 --> 01:48:17.78
Yes.

1641
01:48:17.78 --> 01:48:20.30
And I thought about it for a second.

1642
01:48:20.30 --> 01:48:27.54
And I was, at first I was kind of like, you know, I don't know that I need to answer

1643
01:48:27.54 --> 01:48:28.50
this question.

1644
01:48:28.50 --> 01:48:30.42
This is kind of one of those things.

1645
01:48:30.42 --> 01:48:34.98
And then I just thought to myself, okay, realistically, how do you increase

1646
01:48:34.98 --> 01:48:36.62
someone's confidence?

1647
01:48:36.62 --> 01:48:38.70
Cause it's kind of a throwaway question in a way, right?

1648
01:48:38.70 --> 01:48:40.42
Isn't it a little bit of a throwaway question?

1649
01:48:40.42 --> 01:48:42.14
It's like, hey, what magic pill do you have?

1650
01:48:42.14 --> 01:48:43.14
Yeah, that's crazy.

1651
01:48:43.14 --> 01:48:44.14
Right.

1652
01:48:44.14 --> 01:48:47.42
But that's the answer that I think was was being hoped for.

1653
01:48:47.42 --> 01:48:49.14
Yeah, let's do chocolate version of this.

1654
01:48:49.14 --> 01:48:50.62
How do you increase your confidence?

1655
01:48:50.62 --> 01:48:54.78
And let's put that as a damn bullet point on the click bait, right?

1656
01:48:54.78 --> 01:48:57.02
Navy seal tells you how to increase your confidence.

1657
01:48:57.02 --> 01:48:58.02
Right.

1658
01:48:58.02 --> 01:48:59.02
Right.

1659
01:48:59.02 --> 01:49:00.82
It's out of the click bait all day long.

1660
01:49:00.82 --> 01:49:02.70
So I don't like those kind of things.

1661
01:49:02.70 --> 01:49:05.46
But I thought about it for a second.

1662
01:49:05.46 --> 01:49:09.14
I thought to myself, okay, where does confidence come from?

1663
01:49:09.14 --> 01:49:10.54
And then I rattled off.

1664
01:49:10.54 --> 01:49:19.30
I was like, well, first of all, if you want to be confident, then you should do things

1665
01:49:19.30 --> 01:49:22.50
like exercise and be physically fit.

1666
01:49:22.50 --> 01:49:25.98
If you're physically fit, your confidence will increase.

1667
01:49:25.98 --> 01:49:29.90
You tell me echo Charles, is that factual or wrong?

1668
01:49:29.90 --> 01:49:30.90
That is factual.

1669
01:49:30.90 --> 01:49:31.90
Okay.

1670
01:49:31.90 --> 01:49:36.66
So if you increase your physical capability, you'll be more confident.

1671
01:49:36.66 --> 01:49:42.26
If you learn how to fight, if you learn to get to, more time, boxing, you will become

1672
01:49:42.26 --> 01:49:43.26
more confident.

1673
01:49:43.26 --> 01:49:45.70
Hey, does that sound like I'm a meathead?

1674
01:49:45.70 --> 01:49:46.70
Maybe?

1675
01:49:46.70 --> 01:49:47.70
Guess what?

1676
01:49:47.70 --> 01:49:48.70
It's actually true.

1677
01:49:48.70 --> 01:49:50.54
It's actually a hundred percent true.

1678
01:49:50.54 --> 01:49:55.22
If you're physically capable and you actually know what to do with your physical

1679
01:49:55.22 --> 01:50:00.70
capability in a confrontational situation, you will become more confident.

1680
01:50:00.70 --> 01:50:01.70
Okay.

1681
01:50:01.70 --> 01:50:02.70
So there's next.

1682
01:50:02.70 --> 01:50:03.70
What else?

1683
01:50:03.70 --> 01:50:04.70
Okay.

1684
01:50:04.70 --> 01:50:06.98
How about we learn to articulate ourselves?

1685
01:50:06.98 --> 01:50:07.98
Well, go.

1686
01:50:07.98 --> 01:50:08.98
Okay.

1687
01:50:08.98 --> 01:50:09.98
Yes.

1688
01:50:09.98 --> 01:50:12.42
Will you be more confident if you can speak clearly and concisely and people can understand

1689
01:50:12.42 --> 01:50:13.42
it?

1690
01:50:13.42 --> 01:50:14.42
Yes.

1691
01:50:14.42 --> 01:50:15.42
You will become more confident.

1692
01:50:15.42 --> 01:50:16.42
How do you do that?

1693
01:50:16.42 --> 01:50:17.42
You practice.

1694
01:50:17.42 --> 01:50:18.42
You rehearse.

1695
01:50:18.42 --> 01:50:19.42
You carry on conversations.

1696
01:50:19.42 --> 01:50:22.90
You read a lot so that you have a better vocabulary.

1697
01:50:22.90 --> 01:50:25.18
Once you're done with that, what comes next?

1698
01:50:25.18 --> 01:50:31.58
Well, do we lack confidence if we are in the unknown?

1699
01:50:31.58 --> 01:50:33.02
The answer is yes.

1700
01:50:33.02 --> 01:50:34.78
How do you get more knowledge?

1701
01:50:34.78 --> 01:50:35.78
You study.

1702
01:50:35.78 --> 01:50:36.78
You read.

1703
01:50:36.78 --> 01:50:41.66
You do your best to learn as much as you can possibly learn.

1704
01:50:41.66 --> 01:50:45.58
And that will increase your confidence because you'll be more comfortable in more

1705
01:50:45.58 --> 01:50:49.10
different situations because you have more knowledge.

1706
01:50:49.10 --> 01:50:55.14
And the final thing is if you one way of getting, this is like a self-esteem,

1707
01:50:55.14 --> 01:50:56.14
just licking ice cream going.

1708
01:50:56.14 --> 01:50:58.86
What am I about to say?

1709
01:50:58.86 --> 01:51:08.26
But if you have the confidence to say, I don't know your confidence will increase.

1710
01:51:08.26 --> 01:51:13.18
So I can go and get interviewed by anybody because worst case scenario, I'll say, you

1711
01:51:13.18 --> 01:51:15.66
know, I don't know about that.

1712
01:51:15.66 --> 01:51:18.06
I'm not, I don't actually don't know anything about that.

1713
01:51:18.06 --> 01:51:20.62
I'm going to have to pass on that question because I'm not sure.

1714
01:51:20.62 --> 01:51:23.66
Am I, is everyone in the world supposed to think that jockel knows everything in the

1715
01:51:23.66 --> 01:51:24.66
world?

1716
01:51:24.66 --> 01:51:30.82
Or am I, can I keep, can I, am I humble enough to admit that, you know what, if you

1717
01:51:30.82 --> 01:51:34.90
quiz me about every subject in the world, I may not know it.

1718
01:51:34.90 --> 01:51:36.14
Is that okay?

1719
01:51:36.14 --> 01:51:37.14
It's fine.

1720
01:51:37.14 --> 01:51:40.26
No one expects me to be an expert in anything.

1721
01:51:40.26 --> 01:51:42.10
And definitely not everything.

1722
01:51:42.10 --> 01:51:46.66
Like I'm pretty good in a couple things, but not an expert in anything.

1723
01:51:46.66 --> 01:51:51.10
And so if you do those things, you will become more confident.

1724
01:51:51.10 --> 01:51:52.10
Yeah.

1725
01:51:52.10 --> 01:51:53.42
I thought that was a pretty straightforward.

1726
01:51:53.42 --> 01:51:54.62
I think so too.

1727
01:51:54.62 --> 01:52:01.78
I think that's very, she's an informative, kind of, that kind of makes it less impactful

1728
01:52:01.78 --> 01:52:02.78
if I say informative.

1729
01:52:02.78 --> 01:52:03.78
But yeah, yeah.

1730
01:52:03.78 --> 01:52:05.66
There's also another aspect.

1731
01:52:05.66 --> 01:52:09.18
And I guess this is covered by the other ones, but like just stepping up and leading

1732
01:52:09.18 --> 01:52:11.50
sometimes, we'll get you better.

1733
01:52:11.50 --> 01:52:12.50
Right?

1734
01:52:12.50 --> 01:52:15.94
Stepping up and talking in a group of people, you'll get better at it.

1735
01:52:15.94 --> 01:52:20.10
So when you say, like, basically, like practice stuff, right?

1736
01:52:20.10 --> 01:52:21.10
So yeah, every her straight.

1737
01:52:21.10 --> 01:52:22.10
Absolutely.

1738
01:52:22.10 --> 01:52:24.54
So the, the talking to people that's a big one, like, you know how someone will,

1739
01:52:24.54 --> 01:52:26.50
you'll have, like, I don't know, social anxiety.

1740
01:52:26.50 --> 01:52:28.14
And there's this, it's a spectrum.

1741
01:52:28.14 --> 01:52:30.22
Some people have massive social anxiety.

1742
01:52:30.22 --> 01:52:33.82
Some people just prefer not a lot of people be there, you know, kind of thing.

1743
01:52:33.82 --> 01:52:35.22
And it's a spectrum.

1744
01:52:35.22 --> 01:52:37.78
And obviously real common.

1745
01:52:37.78 --> 01:52:38.78
Right?

1746
01:52:38.78 --> 01:52:43.38
So yeah, if you want to increase confidence, you say, okay, in regards to the talking

1747
01:52:43.38 --> 01:52:47.54
part, in our TQL, practice talking to people like, if you go to the, like, the store,

1748
01:52:47.54 --> 01:52:49.70
this is kind of a little mental exercise they do.

1749
01:52:49.70 --> 01:52:51.54
Do you get a lot done in the grocery store?

1750
01:52:51.54 --> 01:52:56.18
That's here the mental one of the few things I actually do in the grocery store.

1751
01:52:56.18 --> 01:52:59.22
We increase confidence as a drill in the grocery store.

1752
01:52:59.22 --> 01:52:59.58
Yes.

1753
01:52:59.58 --> 01:53:00.58
So, okay.

1754
01:53:00.58 --> 01:53:04.42
And I kind of got it from, like, being in, like, Oregon and sometimes in Hawaii,

1755
01:53:04.42 --> 01:53:06.58
where, so in Oregon, right?

1756
01:53:06.58 --> 01:53:07.58
Okay.

1757
01:53:07.58 --> 01:53:08.58
So we'll compare the two scenarios.

1758
01:53:08.58 --> 01:53:10.06
In, in San Diego, compared to Oregon.

1759
01:53:10.06 --> 01:53:13.10
In San Diego, if, if I go in in the, I don't know, frozen food.

1760
01:53:13.10 --> 01:53:14.10
I'll.

1761
01:53:14.10 --> 01:53:17.66
And someone else is there kind of in front of the piece, whatever I'm getting.

1762
01:53:17.66 --> 01:53:21.02
And I'm going to, I'm going to politely, hopefully politely wait for them to finish

1763
01:53:21.02 --> 01:53:22.02
and leave.

1764
01:53:22.02 --> 01:53:26.90
But put bluntly, that's like, I'm going to wait for them to get out of my way.

1765
01:53:26.90 --> 01:53:28.50
And so I can do what I have to do.

1766
01:53:28.50 --> 01:53:33.74
And then I'm going to, you know, in Oregon, you go to the frozen food section.

1767
01:53:33.74 --> 01:53:35.34
And someone else is there, they're going to look at you.

1768
01:53:35.34 --> 01:53:36.98
But hey, it's almost like in attitude.

1769
01:53:36.98 --> 01:53:37.98
Like, hey, you're here too.

1770
01:53:37.98 --> 01:53:38.98
Shoot, what are you getting?

1771
01:53:38.98 --> 01:53:39.98
You get in peace too, right?

1772
01:53:39.98 --> 01:53:44.98
On, like, kind of like, it's like they acknowledge and for lack of a spectrum, celebrate the

1773
01:53:44.98 --> 01:53:48.02
fact that you're sharing space, you know, like, we're both at the grocery store.

1774
01:53:48.02 --> 01:53:49.98
You don't kind of just, yeah, it's.

1775
01:53:49.98 --> 01:53:52.74
This is my interpretation of the field, right?

1776
01:53:52.74 --> 01:53:55.42
So I kind of got that lesson.

1777
01:53:55.42 --> 01:53:58.50
And I'm quite like that too, but it's more because everyone kind of knows each other.

1778
01:53:58.50 --> 01:53:59.50
Yeah.

1779
01:53:59.50 --> 01:54:00.50
Or you see me got you there.

1780
01:54:00.50 --> 01:54:01.50
And you say hi.

1781
01:54:01.50 --> 01:54:02.50
We know each other.

1782
01:54:02.50 --> 01:54:04.14
That's the, yeah.

1783
01:54:04.14 --> 01:54:09.34
So what I did was kind of try to bring that, I really liked it, by the way.

1784
01:54:09.34 --> 01:54:10.34
Oh, the last spirit.

1785
01:54:10.34 --> 01:54:11.34
That a loss.

1786
01:54:11.34 --> 01:54:13.34
The loss spirit.

1787
01:54:13.34 --> 01:54:14.34
Yes.

1788
01:54:14.34 --> 01:54:17.98
So now you go in the store and you're sharing the same space.

1789
01:54:17.98 --> 01:54:21.94
So I'm not saying every single person you pass, your father and I'm in, hey, that's

1790
01:54:21.94 --> 01:54:22.94
I'm not saying that.

1791
01:54:22.94 --> 01:54:28.06
I'm saying, if you're sharing their space, say something to them, acknowledge them politely.

1792
01:54:28.06 --> 01:54:29.06
Right?

1793
01:54:29.06 --> 01:54:31.50
Where you have to actively expand energy to say something.

1794
01:54:31.50 --> 01:54:35.18
Yes, but it's not, there's a straight from Dalton.

1795
01:54:35.18 --> 01:54:38.98
What I'm saying, like actively like engage in their world, right there.

1796
01:54:38.98 --> 01:54:42.50
You know, so, and that goes for like kind of everyone who's sharing space with you.

1797
01:54:42.50 --> 01:54:45.90
Whether you're, you know how like you're standing there in line and you guys are just sort of,

1798
01:54:45.90 --> 01:54:49.34
oh, you avoid eye contact because you're just on your thing and they're on their thing

1799
01:54:49.34 --> 01:54:51.38
and we're going to say out of each other's way.

1800
01:54:51.38 --> 01:54:53.54
It's not like, don't play it like that.

1801
01:54:53.54 --> 01:54:57.18
Play it like, hey, like, you make eye contact, it's say high.

1802
01:54:57.18 --> 01:55:00.50
You know, kind of thing, you didn't try to do as genuine as possible, obviously, because you

1803
01:55:00.50 --> 01:55:03.94
don't want them to think you're going to catch them outside and sell them something.

1804
01:55:03.94 --> 01:55:04.94
There's something like that.

1805
01:55:04.94 --> 01:55:06.22
And then same thing goes for like the cashier.

1806
01:55:06.22 --> 01:55:10.38
Especially if you see them all the time, you, you don't say the generic, how are

1807
01:55:10.38 --> 01:55:11.38
you like that kind of?

1808
01:55:11.38 --> 01:55:12.38
Yeah.

1809
01:55:12.38 --> 01:55:13.38
I don't know, like make it for real.

1810
01:55:13.38 --> 01:55:15.58
Like you care about like, hey, so how was it today?

1811
01:55:15.58 --> 01:55:18.54
You know, because you know, when you're a cashier, you see people after people, if you

1812
01:55:18.54 --> 01:55:21.30
get crowded, that's something, if it's real dead, that's something.

1813
01:55:21.30 --> 01:55:22.90
So you can say, hey, how was it tonight?

1814
01:55:22.90 --> 01:55:24.10
You know what I like do it?

1815
01:55:24.10 --> 01:55:26.94
I do that more than just a random people.

1816
01:55:26.94 --> 01:55:29.58
I don't, I usually leave people alone because I want to be left alone.

1817
01:55:29.58 --> 01:55:30.58
Right.

1818
01:55:30.58 --> 01:55:33.10
And so like, no, you see me in this store.

1819
01:55:33.10 --> 01:55:34.10
Don't, don't approach.

1820
01:55:34.10 --> 01:55:35.10
Don't mess with you.

1821
01:55:35.10 --> 01:55:36.30
Yeah, stay out of your way, bro.

1822
01:55:36.30 --> 01:55:37.10
Stay out of your way.

1823
01:55:37.10 --> 01:55:42.70
No, but the cash register, the, you know, the waitress, the person behind the whatever

1824
01:55:42.70 --> 01:55:48.70
coffee thing or, you know, like I always try and just be nice to them because I know that

1825
01:55:48.70 --> 01:55:52.34
they're probably having a not nice day because when you're the cash register, people are

1826
01:55:52.34 --> 01:55:57.70
mad at you already, just because there was a line and you could find the discounted chip discounted

1827
01:55:57.70 --> 01:55:58.70
coupon thing.

1828
01:55:58.70 --> 01:55:59.70
Yeah.

1829
01:55:59.70 --> 01:56:03.38
And so, you know, I like to give them a little acknowledgement that's so good in that

1830
01:56:03.38 --> 01:56:06.78
there's actually humans out here that are in the world.

1831
01:56:06.78 --> 01:56:07.78
Yeah.

1832
01:56:07.78 --> 01:56:08.78
What's the same concept?

1833
01:56:08.78 --> 01:56:12.06
And I'm, and my point is that that's just where it kind of came from.

1834
01:56:12.06 --> 01:56:15.02
So the whole point of this is just to increase your confidence and communicating with

1835
01:56:15.02 --> 01:56:16.02
other humans.

1836
01:56:16.02 --> 01:56:22.02
So when, when you do that, the more and more you do that, the more just, I would say comfortable

1837
01:56:22.02 --> 01:56:24.62
you get just talking to random people.

1838
01:56:24.62 --> 01:56:25.62
Yeah.

1839
01:56:25.62 --> 01:56:27.66
You know, like, just people, it doesn't have to be your best friend to start opening up

1840
01:56:27.66 --> 01:56:28.66
a little bit.

1841
01:56:28.66 --> 01:56:29.66
Yeah.

1842
01:56:29.66 --> 01:56:31.18
I mean, obviously not everything, but just just a little bit.

1843
01:56:31.18 --> 01:56:36.42
So now you go into a public place and, bro, you're no stranger to talking to strangers

1844
01:56:36.42 --> 01:56:37.42
anymore.

1845
01:56:37.42 --> 01:56:38.42
You know, and the more and where you do it.

1846
01:56:38.42 --> 01:56:39.70
So yeah, you get more confident.

1847
01:56:39.70 --> 01:56:42.90
Kind of like, oh, if this guy rolls up to me, yeah, I've no problem talking to this guy.

1848
01:56:42.90 --> 01:56:43.90
I don't have social anxiety.

1849
01:56:43.90 --> 01:56:44.90
Yeah, what up, bro?

1850
01:56:44.90 --> 01:56:46.06
You're going to know how my day's going, bro.

1851
01:56:46.06 --> 01:56:47.74
I'll tell you how to start.

1852
01:56:47.74 --> 01:56:50.06
You know, so it's that feeling and it helps me.

1853
01:56:50.06 --> 01:56:51.06
You're all I'm over here.

1854
01:56:51.06 --> 01:56:53.06
Why are you looking at me?

1855
01:56:53.06 --> 01:56:54.06
All I mean, my way.

1856
01:56:54.06 --> 01:56:55.06
Yeah, bro.

1857
01:56:55.06 --> 01:56:56.46
No, I'll spread the last beer.

1858
01:56:56.46 --> 01:56:57.46
Oh, cool.

1859
01:56:57.46 --> 01:56:58.46
Cool.

1860
01:56:58.46 --> 01:57:00.70
And speaking of a low-hospiro, what were you talking about, Jiu Jitsu?

1861
01:57:00.70 --> 01:57:05.66
Well, we're talking about confidence because in order to increase your confidence, one absolute

1862
01:57:05.66 --> 01:57:08.74
100% weight to increase your confidence is to change your Jitsu.

1863
01:57:08.74 --> 01:57:09.58
Yes.

1864
01:57:09.58 --> 01:57:11.94
I just, all genders.

1865
01:57:11.94 --> 01:57:16.50
Let's just say to say, say, say, four, age four and up.

1866
01:57:16.50 --> 01:57:17.50
Age four and up.

1867
01:57:17.50 --> 01:57:18.50
Yes, correct.

1868
01:57:18.50 --> 01:57:19.50
Age four and up.

1869
01:57:19.50 --> 01:57:22.78
Below that is like, there's exceptions for blood and less playtime.

1870
01:57:22.78 --> 01:57:23.78
Yeah.

1871
01:57:23.78 --> 01:57:24.78
Yes.

1872
01:57:24.78 --> 01:57:25.94
Which is part of Jiu Jitsu to buy the way.

1873
01:57:25.94 --> 01:57:26.94
Right.

1874
01:57:26.94 --> 01:57:27.94
Kid.

1875
01:57:27.94 --> 01:57:28.94
Yeah, sure.

1876
01:57:28.94 --> 01:57:29.94
It should be fun.

1877
01:57:29.94 --> 01:57:30.94
Right.

1878
01:57:30.94 --> 01:57:31.94
You'll be up to relate to this.

1879
01:57:31.94 --> 01:57:35.78
So you know, like with your friends when you're young, right?

1880
01:57:35.78 --> 01:57:36.78
Yeah.

1881
01:57:36.78 --> 01:57:39.86
Well, maybe eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

1882
01:57:39.86 --> 01:57:40.86
Yeah.

1883
01:57:40.86 --> 01:57:44.26
When you, 18, 90, 20, three, whatever, when you're drunk at a party with your friends, it's

1884
01:57:44.26 --> 01:57:45.50
all the same deal.

1885
01:57:45.50 --> 01:57:49.74
You guys get in little friendly arguments and it's go time to settle in the yard or in

1886
01:57:49.74 --> 01:57:50.74
not living room.

1887
01:57:50.74 --> 01:57:51.74
Yeah, we're taking a seal.

1888
01:57:51.74 --> 01:57:52.74
Yeah.

1889
01:57:52.74 --> 01:57:53.74
Yeah, yeah.

1890
01:57:53.74 --> 01:57:54.74
It's all, exactly.

1891
01:57:54.74 --> 01:57:55.74
Right.

1892
01:57:55.74 --> 01:57:56.74
And your parents say, hey, take it outside.

1893
01:57:56.74 --> 01:57:57.74
It's all this thing.

1894
01:57:57.74 --> 01:58:00.54
You guys fight us in the grass or the dirt, whatever.

1895
01:58:00.54 --> 01:58:02.54
And you know, who gets fights?

1896
01:58:02.54 --> 01:58:03.54
Usually sometimes.

1897
01:58:03.54 --> 01:58:06.70
Usually the bigger brother or, you know,

1898
01:58:06.70 --> 01:58:08.74
your friend who's bigger usually is going to get you.

1899
01:58:08.74 --> 01:58:09.74
Yeah.

1900
01:58:09.74 --> 01:58:10.74
Right.

1901
01:58:10.74 --> 01:58:11.74
But it's fun.

1902
01:58:11.74 --> 01:58:12.74
That's how it always, it's all fun.

1903
01:58:12.74 --> 01:58:14.74
And maybe you can fight whatever.

1904
01:58:14.74 --> 01:58:16.74
Also the little brother that can't take.

1905
01:58:16.74 --> 01:58:17.74
Yeah, it can't take.

1906
01:58:17.74 --> 01:58:20.58
It's just, I think he tries to like kick you in the nuts.

1907
01:58:20.58 --> 01:58:21.58
Like, you know what I mean?

1908
01:58:21.58 --> 01:58:22.58
You know what I mean?

1909
01:58:22.58 --> 01:58:23.58
Yeah, I do know what he's doing.

1910
01:58:23.58 --> 01:58:24.58
He gets all red in the face.

1911
01:58:24.58 --> 01:58:25.58
Bad temper.

1912
01:58:25.58 --> 01:58:26.58
Got to look out for himself.

1913
01:58:26.58 --> 01:58:27.58
Yeah.

1914
01:58:27.58 --> 01:58:30.62
But once it project the power, even though he's smaller than everyone else, because

1915
01:58:30.62 --> 01:58:31.62
he's younger.

1916
01:58:31.62 --> 01:58:32.62
Sure.

1917
01:58:32.62 --> 01:58:33.62
That happens occasionally.

1918
01:58:33.62 --> 01:58:35.82
And which actually fits into what I'm going to say.

1919
01:58:35.82 --> 01:58:38.70
So what you do to is it's basically that.

1920
01:58:38.70 --> 01:58:42.66
But the skill that that's required to win it that, you know?

1921
01:58:42.66 --> 01:58:45.22
So we still have that need like mean you right now.

1922
01:58:45.22 --> 01:58:47.06
Your whole point is to say that you did to you fun.

1923
01:58:47.06 --> 01:58:47.42
Yes.

1924
01:58:47.42 --> 01:58:47.94
Yeah.

1925
01:58:47.94 --> 01:58:48.46
Agreed.

1926
01:58:48.46 --> 01:58:48.82
Okay.

1927
01:58:48.82 --> 01:58:49.66
So not bad.

1928
01:58:49.66 --> 01:58:51.74
You got to unpack it because it's like you can see.

1929
01:58:51.74 --> 01:58:52.98
There's a lot of things that are going to just

1930
01:58:52.98 --> 01:58:53.98
said to me.

1931
01:58:53.98 --> 01:58:54.98
Oh, I think that's it.

1932
01:58:54.98 --> 01:58:55.98
Not if it was this one.

1933
01:58:55.98 --> 01:58:58.50
I know the thing is, but they don't know what kind of fun.

1934
01:58:58.50 --> 01:59:01.34
You know, so if I say, hey, you know,

1935
01:59:01.34 --> 01:59:03.06
actually it's more fun than that.

1936
01:59:03.06 --> 01:59:04.42
Well, here's the fun.

1937
01:59:04.42 --> 01:59:06.46
It's fun on a whole different level.

1938
01:59:06.46 --> 01:59:06.82
Right.

1939
01:59:06.82 --> 01:59:07.62
Well, here's this.

1940
01:59:07.62 --> 01:59:10.54
Because it's fun because you're connecting things together

1941
01:59:10.54 --> 01:59:13.38
that are part of a grand.

1942
01:59:13.38 --> 01:59:13.74
Right.

1943
01:59:13.74 --> 01:59:15.34
It's like being a musician.

1944
01:59:15.34 --> 01:59:15.94
It's like, yeah.

1945
01:59:15.94 --> 01:59:17.50
Hey, there's the well.

1946
01:59:17.50 --> 01:59:17.94
Yes.

1947
01:59:17.94 --> 01:59:19.70
There's that 100%.

1948
01:59:19.70 --> 01:59:22.78
But I think just as a fundamental kind of, I don't want to say

1949
01:59:22.78 --> 01:59:24.26
need, but it won't.

1950
01:59:24.26 --> 01:59:26.42
It's like, but like see how you're even looking at

1951
01:59:26.42 --> 01:59:27.02
you right now.

1952
01:59:27.02 --> 01:59:28.70
Like, but I kind of want to fight you right now.

1953
01:59:28.70 --> 01:59:32.30
You know, in a like, I don't want to fight you.

1954
01:59:32.30 --> 01:59:34.10
Oh, but I kind of want to fight you.

1955
01:59:34.10 --> 01:59:38.18
As a friend, like, do you want to take it on the mat?

1956
01:59:38.18 --> 01:59:38.18
Sure.

1957
01:59:38.18 --> 01:59:39.50
You know, I'm kind of kind of think.

1958
01:59:39.50 --> 01:59:41.78
Like, if we were like 10 years old, you were like,

1959
01:59:41.78 --> 01:59:43.82
what, you want to take it outside and throw it out.

1960
01:59:43.82 --> 01:59:44.82
Yeah.

1961
01:59:44.82 --> 01:59:46.42
As friends, but that's all.

1962
01:59:46.42 --> 01:59:47.66
Gigiets are really is.

1963
01:59:47.66 --> 01:59:48.74
That's really what it is.

1964
01:59:48.74 --> 01:59:51.38
It's like, yeah, let's go on the mat and let's basically fight

1965
01:59:51.38 --> 01:59:55.46
in a way that we don't burn each other's bridges and not be friends anymore.

1966
01:59:55.46 --> 02:00:00.18
And then, but on top of that, it's like they teach you this skill to do that.

1967
02:00:00.18 --> 02:00:01.58
That can all literally save your life.

1968
02:00:01.58 --> 02:00:02.42
Oh, yeah, literally.

1969
02:00:02.42 --> 02:00:04.02
It had a minimal.

1970
02:00:04.02 --> 02:00:06.74
It will increase your confidence as a human.

1971
02:00:06.74 --> 02:00:08.74
A human being, yes, sir.

1972
02:00:08.74 --> 02:00:10.14
Sometimes it gives you too much confidence.

1973
02:00:10.14 --> 02:00:10.98
Too much.

1974
02:00:10.98 --> 02:00:11.50
Yes, especially early on.

1975
02:00:11.50 --> 02:00:17.42
Yeah, especially if you're 13, 14, 15, 21, yeah, 21.

1976
02:00:17.42 --> 02:00:18.26
I don't know.

1977
02:00:18.26 --> 02:00:19.66
You start thinking you just smash.

1978
02:00:19.66 --> 02:00:20.78
Yeah, I feel everybody's not on that.

1979
02:00:20.78 --> 02:00:23.50
So if you're training Gigiets, when you're changing your

1980
02:00:23.50 --> 02:00:26.90
to, what if you're on the path and might be good to,

1981
02:00:26.90 --> 02:00:30.90
if you need Gigiets to gear, what you do need some Gigiets to gear.

1982
02:00:30.90 --> 02:00:33.22
You need what's called a Gigi.

1983
02:00:33.22 --> 02:00:37.06
If you need a Gigi, you can get a Gigi from our company, which is

1984
02:00:37.06 --> 02:00:39.34
based here in America.

1985
02:00:39.34 --> 02:00:44.50
And we make Gis all American from the ground up,

1986
02:00:44.50 --> 02:00:46.38
from the dirt.

1987
02:00:46.38 --> 02:00:50.50
It's called Origin Main, Best Gis Ever in the world too.

1988
02:00:50.50 --> 02:00:51.22
Yeah, ever.

1989
02:00:51.22 --> 02:00:52.38
Ever.

1990
02:00:52.38 --> 02:00:53.38
In the history of Gigiets.

1991
02:00:53.38 --> 02:00:56.34
And if you need rash guards, which you can use for Gigiets,

1992
02:00:56.34 --> 02:01:01.38
you can also use them for weightlifting, you can use them for running

1993
02:01:01.38 --> 02:01:06.18
cycling, cycling, surfing, guitar playing.

1994
02:01:06.18 --> 02:01:08.34
Might not be necessary.

1995
02:01:08.34 --> 02:01:10.42
I do not wear rash guards when I play guitar.

1996
02:01:10.42 --> 02:01:11.34
Maybe I should.

1997
02:01:11.34 --> 02:01:12.34
Maybe.

1998
02:01:12.34 --> 02:01:17.34
And those are also made here in America, along with what else?

1999
02:01:17.34 --> 02:01:20.78
Just regular clothes too, shirts and some athletic wear.

2000
02:01:20.78 --> 02:01:23.86
But the shorts that I wear only wear, well, I have one pair like

2001
02:01:23.86 --> 02:01:25.30
random camo shorts.

2002
02:01:25.30 --> 02:01:28.06
So by the way, I'm going to get you some new shorts coming in.

2003
02:01:28.06 --> 02:01:30.06
You're going to be very excited about these shorts.

2004
02:01:30.06 --> 02:01:33.10
Well, I already am, because every season, even the era, the

2005
02:01:33.10 --> 02:01:35.90
mistake shorts that they made, they were my favorite shorts.

2006
02:01:35.90 --> 02:01:37.10
Literally ever.

2007
02:01:37.10 --> 02:01:39.98
And then they came out with deliberate shorts that they can actually

2008
02:01:39.98 --> 02:01:40.98
sell.

2009
02:01:40.98 --> 02:01:42.38
No, those are my favorite shorts.

2010
02:01:42.38 --> 02:01:44.58
So yeah, you say it, or because you know what, I'm about

2011
02:01:44.58 --> 02:01:45.58
peaky cares.

2012
02:01:45.58 --> 02:01:47.50
You don't care about the fashion stuff, but they fashion

2013
02:01:47.50 --> 02:01:48.50
subtleties.

2014
02:01:48.50 --> 02:01:52.30
That's to do with fit, fit, style, but there's it's subtle, though.

2015
02:01:52.30 --> 02:01:54.70
Anyway, they got a bunch of stuff on there.

2016
02:01:54.70 --> 02:01:58.66
Clothing wise as well, like joggers and you like the job.

2017
02:01:58.66 --> 02:02:00.02
And then they got supplements.

2018
02:02:00.02 --> 02:02:01.50
We got supplements.

2019
02:02:01.50 --> 02:02:02.50
Sure.

2020
02:02:02.50 --> 02:02:03.50
We got supplements.

2021
02:02:03.50 --> 02:02:04.74
We got joint warfare.

2022
02:02:04.74 --> 02:02:06.58
We got joint warfare is good.

2023
02:02:06.58 --> 02:02:09.26
If you're working out, if you're on the path, you're doing it's going to take a

2024
02:02:09.26 --> 02:02:10.26
beating.

2025
02:02:10.26 --> 02:02:15.10
Joint warfare will protect them and heal them.

2026
02:02:15.10 --> 02:02:17.02
Crilloil, another good one.

2027
02:02:17.02 --> 02:02:21.26
Discipline, good, pre-operational, get some.

2028
02:02:21.26 --> 02:02:24.58
Get your mind right, real quick, get your body right.

2029
02:02:24.58 --> 02:02:27.78
And then of course, we have a little something called malk.

2030
02:02:27.78 --> 02:02:29.74
Yeah, so we do.

2031
02:02:29.74 --> 02:02:30.74
What is malk?

2032
02:02:30.74 --> 02:02:31.74
Really simple.

2033
02:02:31.74 --> 02:02:32.74
It's malk.

2034
02:02:32.74 --> 02:02:33.74
Malk.

2035
02:02:33.74 --> 02:02:34.74
Yeah.

2036
02:02:34.74 --> 02:02:35.74
Show, you know.

2037
02:02:35.74 --> 02:02:38.34
You know, co-a-the-kid.

2038
02:02:38.34 --> 02:02:39.34
Yeah.

2039
02:02:39.34 --> 02:02:40.98
Happens to be my cousin.

2040
02:02:40.98 --> 02:02:42.86
He's on the path.

2041
02:02:42.86 --> 02:02:45.10
Oh, the beginnings of the path.

2042
02:02:45.10 --> 02:02:46.10
Yeah.

2043
02:02:46.10 --> 02:02:47.10
Taking the first step.

2044
02:02:47.10 --> 02:02:50.66
Interestingly, got on the malk train as the first step.

2045
02:02:50.66 --> 02:02:51.66
That's an interesting thing.

2046
02:02:51.66 --> 02:02:52.66
That's interesting.

2047
02:02:52.66 --> 02:02:53.66
That's interesting.

2048
02:02:53.66 --> 02:02:57.22
When you're not really technically on the path, and you just drink malky, just think

2049
02:02:57.22 --> 02:02:59.10
you're drinking a milkshake, you seem to say.

2050
02:02:59.10 --> 02:03:00.10
Yeah, you're a good boy.

2051
02:03:00.10 --> 02:03:01.38
You're drinking it for the taste.

2052
02:03:01.38 --> 02:03:02.38
That's a good point.

2053
02:03:02.38 --> 02:03:06.30
Which is good, though, because it'll keep you on the path in regards to that additional

2054
02:03:06.30 --> 02:03:07.58
protein that you're going to get.

2055
02:03:07.58 --> 02:03:09.38
The original flavor was meant chocolate.

2056
02:03:09.38 --> 02:03:10.38
My favorite.

2057
02:03:10.38 --> 02:03:13.30
We went to peanut butter from there available.

2058
02:03:13.30 --> 02:03:16.22
Then vanilla gorilla.

2059
02:03:16.22 --> 02:03:18.94
I don't like plain vanilla.

2060
02:03:18.94 --> 02:03:22.98
I don't like, I don't want to eat vanilla anything.

2061
02:03:22.98 --> 02:03:26.34
Unless I'm eating it with some damn chocolate cake.

2062
02:03:26.34 --> 02:03:29.54
I'm not going to order vanilla ice cream ever.

2063
02:03:29.54 --> 02:03:33.54
The other day when you had a cake situation, a cake scenario.

2064
02:03:33.54 --> 02:03:36.90
When it was some ice cream, it was vanilla.

2065
02:03:36.90 --> 02:03:37.90
There you go.

2066
02:03:37.90 --> 02:03:41.58
That whole scenario, just on the folded wrong, it really did.

2067
02:03:41.58 --> 02:03:48.30
I just rationalized the whole thing, lied to myself, just got after it.

2068
02:03:48.30 --> 02:03:50.62
But what, what here's what bummed me out.

2069
02:03:50.62 --> 02:03:52.94
As soon as I was done, I was like, well, I was on the road.

2070
02:03:52.94 --> 02:03:53.94
No milk.

2071
02:03:53.94 --> 02:03:55.70
So, you don't have dessert.

2072
02:03:55.70 --> 02:04:00.74
Sometimes you get that little, like a little something that tastes good to wash down the

2073
02:04:00.74 --> 02:04:01.74
steak.

2074
02:04:01.74 --> 02:04:02.74
That's a good steak.

2075
02:04:02.74 --> 02:04:05.50
And then there's no milk, because I'm on the road.

2076
02:04:05.50 --> 02:04:06.50
I got to figure that out.

2077
02:04:06.50 --> 02:04:07.50
I got to figure that out.

2078
02:04:07.50 --> 02:04:08.50
People give me good suggestions.

2079
02:04:08.50 --> 02:04:11.74
I know I can put a little baggy in the thing and just grab some milk somewhere and mix

2080
02:04:11.74 --> 02:04:12.74
it up.

2081
02:04:12.74 --> 02:04:13.74
No factor.

2082
02:04:13.74 --> 02:04:14.74
So I need to start doing that.

2083
02:04:14.74 --> 02:04:15.74
None the less.

2084
02:04:15.74 --> 02:04:17.74
You don't like vanilla.

2085
02:04:17.74 --> 02:04:20.26
So no, vanilla is not my favorite flavor.

2086
02:04:20.26 --> 02:04:23.02
The vanilla tastes good.

2087
02:04:23.02 --> 02:04:26.26
I was not the judge on the vanilla.

2088
02:04:26.26 --> 02:04:29.74
You know, Pete and Brian were like, hey, the vanilla is awesome.

2089
02:04:29.74 --> 02:04:31.06
I said, I'll try it.

2090
02:04:31.06 --> 02:04:32.06
It tastes fine.

2091
02:04:32.06 --> 02:04:35.86
I'm not the judge, because I don't want to judge something that I don't fully

2092
02:04:35.86 --> 02:04:36.86
comprehend.

2093
02:04:36.86 --> 02:04:39.58
I'm not deserving of being a vanilla judge.

2094
02:04:39.58 --> 02:04:41.42
So therefore I didn't do it.

2095
02:04:41.42 --> 02:04:48.14
But the darkness, which is chocolate, the darkness, that is also freaking delicious.

2096
02:04:48.14 --> 02:04:53.66
And when you're getting this stuff, you'll be getting it from origin main.

2097
02:04:53.66 --> 02:04:55.90
You got Cindy up there, you met Cindy.

2098
02:04:55.90 --> 02:04:57.70
Of course she's fired up.

2099
02:04:57.70 --> 02:05:04.06
So when you're getting your stuff packed, it's not just being randomly placed in a box

2100
02:05:04.06 --> 02:05:05.06
by a robot.

2101
02:05:05.06 --> 02:05:07.02
No, Cindy's up there.

2102
02:05:07.02 --> 02:05:09.18
She's getting after it.

2103
02:05:09.18 --> 02:05:11.26
And I'm going to say one more thing, little announcement.

2104
02:05:11.26 --> 02:05:12.26
Sure.

2105
02:05:12.26 --> 02:05:13.26
Little announcement.

2106
02:05:13.26 --> 02:05:15.06
So you remember what you were a little kid?

2107
02:05:15.06 --> 02:05:16.06
Yes.

2108
02:05:16.06 --> 02:05:18.10
And you love chocolate milk.

2109
02:05:18.10 --> 02:05:20.14
Yes, and you love strawberry milk.

2110
02:05:20.14 --> 02:05:21.54
You loved it so much.

2111
02:05:21.54 --> 02:05:22.54
Whatever.

2112
02:05:22.54 --> 02:05:24.02
A little brand name that you got.

2113
02:05:24.02 --> 02:05:27.46
And there was a couple of them that were prominent.

2114
02:05:27.46 --> 02:05:28.86
And they tasted delicious.

2115
02:05:28.86 --> 02:05:30.02
And it was like dessert.

2116
02:05:30.02 --> 02:05:33.30
And for some reason, you didn't really understand why, but your parents would actually

2117
02:05:33.30 --> 02:05:36.58
allow you to drink it all the time.

2118
02:05:36.58 --> 02:05:39.02
Because your parents thought, well, you know, it's kind of milk and it's got to be good

2119
02:05:39.02 --> 02:05:40.02
to go.

2120
02:05:40.02 --> 02:05:41.02
I can't see it.

2121
02:05:41.02 --> 02:05:42.02
It'll make their bones strong.

2122
02:05:42.02 --> 02:05:43.74
There's a little protein in there.

2123
02:05:43.74 --> 02:05:45.62
So we'll just let them drink it.

2124
02:05:45.62 --> 02:05:50.06
What they didn't realize is that little chocolate and strawberry milk that you were drinking

2125
02:05:50.06 --> 02:05:57.42
as a kid is completely filled with sugar and high fruit dogs corn syrup and a bunch

2126
02:05:57.42 --> 02:06:00.98
of other chemicals that they couldn't even pronounce.

2127
02:06:00.98 --> 02:06:06.22
And so the milk that your parents, my parents, were allowing me to drink was actually

2128
02:06:06.22 --> 02:06:11.54
a freaking net loss overall to my health because it was filled with poison.

2129
02:06:11.54 --> 02:06:13.10
But it tasted good.

2130
02:06:13.10 --> 02:06:14.10
And you loved it.

2131
02:06:14.10 --> 02:06:15.26
It was like a dessert.

2132
02:06:15.26 --> 02:06:19.14
You could have all the time.

2133
02:06:19.14 --> 02:06:20.14
But it was filled with poison.

2134
02:06:20.14 --> 02:06:21.14
So you know what we did?

2135
02:06:21.14 --> 02:06:22.54
We fixed it.

2136
02:06:22.54 --> 02:06:23.54
We fixed it.

2137
02:06:23.54 --> 02:06:29.10
And we now have available at this time, warrior kid, milk.

2138
02:06:29.10 --> 02:06:33.42
Yes, warrior kid, milk.

2139
02:06:33.42 --> 02:06:34.82
We made chocolate.

2140
02:06:34.82 --> 02:06:38.90
And we made strawberry just like you remember when you were a kid, only instead of having

2141
02:06:38.90 --> 02:06:43.98
a bunch of garbage in it, it's got protein, extra protein, 12 grams.

2142
02:06:43.98 --> 02:06:46.78
It's got vitamins that you need.

2143
02:06:46.78 --> 02:06:50.74
It's got probiotics because kids are getting told all the time.

2144
02:06:50.74 --> 02:06:53.90
The parents are getting told they need to take probiotics and here take this pill and

2145
02:06:53.90 --> 02:06:54.90
apple.

2146
02:06:54.90 --> 02:06:58.14
No, take warrior kid milk.

2147
02:06:58.14 --> 02:07:01.02
And there's no sugar in it.

2148
02:07:01.02 --> 02:07:02.90
And it tastes freaking amazing.

2149
02:07:02.90 --> 02:07:09.06
So it's better than any other of these flavored, whatever chocolate milk you grew up

2150
02:07:09.06 --> 02:07:11.74
on, this tastes better.

2151
02:07:11.74 --> 02:07:17.66
So now your, or your kid out there can get on the milk train.

2152

2153
02:07:18.66 --> 02:07:25.86
And again, for me to see kids and be able to help out kids that are four years old, six

2154
02:07:25.86 --> 02:07:30.26
years old, eight years old, to give them something that's healthy, that tastes good, that's

2155
02:07:30.26 --> 02:07:32.94
going to make them stronger.

2156
02:07:32.94 --> 02:07:33.94
And healthier.

2157
02:07:33.94 --> 02:07:35.34
I mean, this is what it's all about.

2158
02:07:35.34 --> 02:07:41.82
So border up some warrior kid milk for your children.

2159
02:07:41.82 --> 02:07:43.38

Yeah, one way ticket.

2163
02:07:46.74 --> 02:07:48.74
Is that a plan?

2164
02:07:48.74 --> 02:07:50.74
One way ticket on the milk.

2165
02:07:50.74 --> 02:07:51.74
Yeah, you understand what I mean.

2166
02:07:51.74 --> 02:07:52.74
Yeah, totally.

2167
02:07:52.74 --> 02:07:53.74
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2168
02:07:53.74 --> 02:07:54.74
Fully.

2169
02:07:54.74 --> 02:07:58.58
The vanilla speaking of which, my son, two years old, by the way, liked the vanilla.

2170
02:07:58.58 --> 02:07:59.58
That's for more.

2171
02:07:59.58 --> 02:08:00.58
I didn't know.

2172
02:08:00.58 --> 02:08:05.30
I'm like, should I give my son that much additional.

2173
02:08:05.30 --> 02:08:09.54
You know, protein, you know, you even questioned that.

2174
02:08:09.54 --> 02:08:13.26
I just don't know a lot of things, you know, it's for in regards.

2175
02:08:13.26 --> 02:08:16.74
Either way, so okay, yes, kids on milk train on the path.

2176
02:08:16.74 --> 02:08:17.74
Kids are on the path.

2177
02:08:17.74 --> 02:08:18.74
Yes, straight on.

2178
02:08:18.74 --> 02:08:19.74
They want to be.

2179
02:08:19.74 --> 02:08:22.94
At that book signing, there wasn't, there weren't many kids there.

2180
02:08:22.94 --> 02:08:26.06
Yeah, the ones that I did on the East Coast, lots of kids.

2181
02:08:26.06 --> 02:08:28.98
It was a kids all over the path fired up, man.

2182
02:08:28.98 --> 02:08:30.94
It was amazing.

2183
02:08:30.94 --> 02:08:34.42
Every kid there last night was on the path.

2184
02:08:34.42 --> 02:08:39.22
Yeah, one kid literally tried to challenge me to introduce you to match on more than one

2185
02:08:39.22 --> 02:08:40.22
occasion.

2186
02:08:40.22 --> 02:08:41.22
And I'm not even joking.

2187
02:08:41.22 --> 02:08:44.14
Like, for real, wanted to, which I dug by the way, I couldn't engage him because, you

2188
02:08:44.14 --> 02:08:46.22
know, you know, I mean, just get the knowledge.

2189
02:08:46.22 --> 02:08:47.66
Challenge, maybe you get that double.

2190
02:08:47.66 --> 02:08:48.66
Straight.

2191
02:08:48.66 --> 02:08:49.66
Straight.

2192
02:08:49.66 --> 02:08:50.66
You do right.

2193
02:08:50.66 --> 02:08:51.66
Okay, kids on the path.

2194
02:08:51.66 --> 02:08:56.18
So which brings me to our store, Jocquoise store.

2195
02:08:56.18 --> 02:08:59.06
It's called Jocquoise store, right?

2196
02:08:59.06 --> 02:09:00.06
Pretty straightforward.

2197
02:09:00.06 --> 02:09:04.38
Anyway, there is, there are where your kid rash guards for one name.

2198
02:09:04.38 --> 02:09:05.38
Join Jocquoise too.

2199
02:09:05.38 --> 02:09:06.94
No, geek part of it.

2200
02:09:06.94 --> 02:09:08.14
Brash guards on there.

2201
02:09:08.14 --> 02:09:10.26
There's obviously where your kid shirts.

2202
02:09:10.26 --> 02:09:11.82
If they're in the geek part of it, that's cool.

2203
02:09:11.82 --> 02:09:15.62
You got a origin name.com and you get them, you get them the warrior geek.

2204
02:09:15.62 --> 02:09:16.62
Get some.

2205
02:09:16.62 --> 02:09:17.62
Boom.

2206
02:09:17.62 --> 02:09:22.02
And also, new addition for where your kid's patches on there right now.

2207
02:09:22.02 --> 02:09:24.62
If you went really, really, really right now, you get your life.

2208
02:09:24.62 --> 02:09:28.86
I've patches for your geek for your backpack.

2209
02:09:28.86 --> 02:09:30.82
You know, we're obviously where everyone put it.

2210
02:09:30.82 --> 02:09:34.26
But yeah, little round one and a long kind of Jocquoise one made kind of for Jocquoise

2211
02:09:34.26 --> 02:09:35.26
store.

2212
02:09:35.26 --> 02:09:44.26
Also in Jocquoise store, Jocquoise store, is where you can get your shirts, disilleting freedom.

2213
02:09:44.26 --> 02:09:47.10
This one of the thing about shirts is everyone wears shirts.

2214
02:09:47.10 --> 02:09:50.66
Even if you don't want to wear one, which I don't like wearing a shirt.

2215
02:09:50.66 --> 02:09:53.10
But I, you sometimes you gotta wear a shirt.

2216
02:09:53.10 --> 02:09:54.10
You kind of gotta wear shirt.

2217
02:09:54.10 --> 02:09:55.10
Yeah.

2218
02:09:55.10 --> 02:09:56.10
Yeah.

2219
02:09:56.10 --> 02:09:57.10
Everyone is a shirt.

2220
02:09:57.10 --> 02:09:58.10
Might as well be a kind of a cool one.

2221
02:09:58.10 --> 02:09:59.10
Might as well represent.

2222
02:09:59.10 --> 02:10:00.10
Big time.

2223
02:10:00.10 --> 02:10:01.74
And trucker's hats.

2224
02:10:01.74 --> 02:10:02.74
Truckers hats on there.

2225
02:10:02.74 --> 02:10:04.62
It's completely stoked on my discipline.

2226
02:10:04.62 --> 02:10:05.62
It goes freedom.

2227
02:10:05.62 --> 02:10:06.62
Hat.

2228
02:10:06.62 --> 02:10:07.90
Are the deaf core hats out yet?

2229
02:10:07.90 --> 02:10:10.54
The deaf core hats are, should be done.

2230
02:10:10.54 --> 02:10:11.54
Are they live?

2231
02:10:11.54 --> 02:10:12.54
I don't know.

2232
02:10:12.54 --> 02:10:13.54
Okay.

2233
02:10:13.54 --> 02:10:18.98
There is a technical thing where like the logo and you know, because hats have panels,

2234
02:10:18.98 --> 02:10:20.62
a certain amount of panels.

2235
02:10:20.62 --> 02:10:24.10
And you know, the logo does it fit on this, does it call on the seam?

2236
02:10:24.10 --> 02:10:25.10
Yeah.

2237
02:10:25.10 --> 02:10:27.06
Or do we need a different panel hat now?

2238
02:10:27.06 --> 02:10:29.10
So anyway, it's very technical.

2239
02:10:29.10 --> 02:10:32.62
Well, let's all have the deaf core hat is out soon.

2240
02:10:32.62 --> 02:10:33.62
That's deeper.

2241
02:10:33.62 --> 02:10:34.90
Is there anything right there?

2242
02:10:34.90 --> 02:10:36.22
What about the deaf core?

2243
02:10:36.22 --> 02:10:37.22
Sure.

2244
02:10:37.22 --> 02:10:38.22
Is there a pure deaf core shirt?

2245
02:10:38.22 --> 02:10:39.22
Black ops.

2246
02:10:39.22 --> 02:10:40.22
Black ops.

2247
02:10:40.22 --> 02:10:41.22
Yes.

2248
02:10:41.22 --> 02:10:42.22
And then I was going to call.

2249
02:10:42.22 --> 02:10:45.26
I was thinking a one called deaf core declassifying.

2250
02:10:45.26 --> 02:10:46.86
It's just white on white.

2251
02:10:46.86 --> 02:10:47.86
Whatever.

2252
02:10:47.86 --> 02:10:48.86
Black ops.

2253
02:10:48.86 --> 02:10:49.86
You see what I'm saying?

2254
02:10:49.86 --> 02:10:54.14
Anyway, well, you know, yeah, you know, I'm going to have to ask that we all kind

2255
02:10:54.14 --> 02:10:56.06
of just kind of check back on that one.

2256
02:10:56.06 --> 02:10:57.06
Okay.

2257
02:10:57.06 --> 02:10:58.06
Maybe it's life.

2258
02:10:58.06 --> 02:10:59.06
Maybe it's not.

2259
02:10:59.06 --> 02:11:02.22
Nonetheless, if you go there and you want to represent hardcore, that's where you can get

2260
02:11:02.22 --> 02:11:04.94
you shirt or hoodie, new hoodie on the way, by the way.

2261
02:11:04.94 --> 02:11:05.94
Oh, yeah.

2262
02:11:05.94 --> 02:11:08.34
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy,

2263
02:11:08.34 --> 02:11:09.34
technique.

2264
02:11:09.34 --> 02:11:12.34
This better be good.

2265
02:11:12.34 --> 02:11:13.34
Exactly.

2266
02:11:13.34 --> 02:11:14.34
That's the thing.

2267
02:11:14.34 --> 02:11:15.34
Anyway, hoodie's on there.

2268
02:11:15.34 --> 02:11:16.58
A lot of cool stuff on there.

2269
02:11:16.58 --> 02:11:17.74
Oh, and I did the research.

2270
02:11:17.74 --> 02:11:18.74
What's better?

2271
02:11:18.74 --> 02:11:19.74
What do people?

2272
02:11:19.74 --> 02:11:20.74
Literally.

2273
02:11:20.74 --> 02:11:23.46
What do people like better flex fit hat or trucker hat?

2274
02:11:23.46 --> 02:11:24.46
Which one?

2275
02:11:24.46 --> 02:11:25.46
Even.

2276
02:11:25.46 --> 02:11:26.46
Even.

2277
02:11:26.46 --> 02:11:27.46
Okay.

2278
02:11:27.46 --> 02:11:30.86
So actually, there's like, I think two more people historically speaking,

2279
02:11:30.86 --> 02:11:31.86
like the snap back.

2280
02:11:31.86 --> 02:11:34.10
So technically you're right.

2281
02:11:34.10 --> 02:11:35.10
Yes.

2282
02:11:35.10 --> 02:11:36.90
We got the rest cards in there as well.

2283
02:11:36.90 --> 02:11:37.90
All right.

2284
02:11:37.90 --> 02:11:38.62
Also got the podcast.

2285
02:11:38.62 --> 02:11:40.14
Subscribe to it wherever.

2286
02:11:40.14 --> 02:11:42.70
And don't forget the warrior kid podcast.

2287
02:11:42.70 --> 02:11:44.18
A lot of people don't know about that.

2288
02:11:44.18 --> 02:11:45.18
Yeah.

2289
02:11:45.18 --> 02:11:46.62
So spread the word on the warrior kid podcast.

2290
02:11:46.62 --> 02:11:49.26
Little questions from Uncle Jake,

2291
02:11:49.26 --> 02:11:56.02
for Uncle Jake and the little stories from Uncle Jake about how he developed his sort of values

2292
02:11:56.02 --> 02:11:57.02
in the world.

2293
02:11:57.02 --> 02:11:59.50
That's the warrior kid podcast.

2294
02:11:59.50 --> 02:12:08.70
The warrior kid soap from Irish Oaks Ranch.com, young Aiden, the warrior kid, milking goats,

2295
02:12:08.70 --> 02:12:15.26
making soap, getting after it, order some of that so you can stay clean.

2296
02:12:15.26 --> 02:12:24.58
Also YouTube, check out Echo's legit enhanced videos, which some people like some people

2297
02:12:24.58 --> 02:12:25.94
like them.

2298
02:12:25.94 --> 02:12:27.34
Most people I'd say like them.

2299
02:12:27.34 --> 02:12:30.10
You don't get a lot of thumbs down on your videos.

2300
02:12:30.10 --> 02:12:31.10
Yeah.

2301
02:12:31.10 --> 02:12:36.74
And what I like is when someone thumbs down your video, there's multiple people in the comments

2302
02:12:36.74 --> 02:12:41.42
that'll be like, who the hell, calm down this, calm you next.

2303
02:12:41.42 --> 02:12:42.42
Okay.

2304
02:12:42.42 --> 02:12:43.78
So that's good.

2305
02:12:43.78 --> 02:12:47.26
And we've got some plans for the YouTube.

2306
02:12:47.26 --> 02:12:49.74
We're going to step it up a little bit.

2307
02:12:49.74 --> 02:12:50.74
Yeah.

2308
02:12:50.74 --> 02:12:51.74
A little bit more.

2309
02:12:51.74 --> 02:12:52.74
I should say could you step it up a little bit?

2310
02:12:52.74 --> 02:12:53.74
Yeah.

2311
02:12:53.74 --> 02:12:54.74
We're going to step it up a little bit more.

2312
02:12:54.74 --> 02:12:55.74
Yeah.

2313
02:12:55.74 --> 02:12:58.58
In general, are like fun to watch.

2314
02:12:58.58 --> 02:13:00.50
Maybe just speaking from myself.

2315
02:13:00.50 --> 02:13:02.86
But I would tend to agree with you.

2316
02:13:02.86 --> 02:13:07.98
And also psychological warfare working on album number two, psychological warfare.

2317
02:13:07.98 --> 02:13:10.70
We're aiming for a Christmas release.

2318
02:13:10.70 --> 02:13:12.46
If you have any suggestions, hit me up on Twitter.

2319
02:13:12.46 --> 02:13:16.02
In the meantime, you got the psychological warfare one album, which can help you get through

2320
02:13:16.02 --> 02:13:17.50
whatever little moments of weakness.

2321
02:13:17.50 --> 02:13:19.50
I wish I had it the other day for that cake.

2322
02:13:19.50 --> 02:13:21.50
Got my brain with ice cream.

2323
02:13:21.50 --> 02:13:22.50
Yeah.

2324
02:13:22.50 --> 02:13:23.50
So much out for that.

2325
02:13:23.50 --> 02:13:26.74
It seemed like anyway, according to your post.

2326
02:13:26.74 --> 02:13:28.78
You that you learned a little lesson.

2327
02:13:28.78 --> 02:13:30.18
And you're open about it too.

2328
02:13:30.18 --> 02:13:31.18
Yeah.

2329
02:13:31.18 --> 02:13:32.18
That's good.

2330
02:13:32.18 --> 02:13:33.18
Yeah.

2331
02:13:33.18 --> 02:13:37.02
You can't be hiding your failures in an actor like, no, because I'm human.

2332
02:13:37.02 --> 02:13:38.02
Yeah.

2333
02:13:38.02 --> 02:13:39.02
Yeah.

2334
02:13:39.02 --> 02:13:40.22
Anyone that thinks I'm not human, you're wrong.

2335
02:13:40.22 --> 02:13:42.06
I'm all too human.

2336
02:13:42.06 --> 02:13:46.26
I get tapped out in duejitsu.

2337
02:13:46.26 --> 02:13:48.06
I get what you know what I mean.

2338
02:13:48.06 --> 02:13:50.26
I mean, it's like, yeah.

2339
02:13:50.26 --> 02:13:51.26
Hey.

2340
02:13:51.26 --> 02:13:52.26
And you pound huge pieces of the cake.

2341
02:13:52.26 --> 02:13:53.58
Everyone's so wild.

2342
02:13:53.58 --> 02:13:54.78
Cake with ice cream.

2343
02:13:54.78 --> 02:13:55.78
Oh.

2344
02:13:55.78 --> 02:13:57.70
So disappointed with myself.

2345
02:13:57.70 --> 02:13:59.90
Anyway, stay on the path.

2346
02:13:59.90 --> 02:14:01.42
This is what I'm saying.

2347
02:14:01.42 --> 02:14:08.66
Also, if you're incorporating kettlebell workouts in various ring workouts, I'll tell you

2348
02:14:08.66 --> 02:14:12.34
where you can get them from on it on it.com slash jockel by the way.

2349
02:14:12.34 --> 02:14:17.34
I incorporate rings every single day every single day for ads and core about.

2350
02:14:17.34 --> 02:14:18.34
It's good.

2351
02:14:18.34 --> 02:14:20.58
And I can't quite, I can almost do pull ups again.

2352
02:14:20.58 --> 02:14:23.18
Oh, with my step forward, whatever, but muscle ups coming through.

2353
02:14:23.18 --> 02:14:24.18
My slips coming through.

2354
02:14:24.18 --> 02:14:30.14
Actually, I actually my shoulders getting back up to speed because it went through

2355
02:14:30.14 --> 02:14:31.14
a little down period.

2356
02:14:31.14 --> 02:14:35.38
Then it got, then it got healed now that I tweaked it again, doing something stupid.

2357
02:14:35.38 --> 02:14:36.98
You're in a dead, yeah, eat ice cream.

2358
02:14:36.98 --> 02:14:37.98
That's it.

2359
02:14:37.98 --> 02:14:38.98
No, I didn't do that.

2360
02:14:38.98 --> 02:14:45.06
I added massive numbers of weighted dips super deep and a mess up your shoulder.

2361
02:14:45.06 --> 02:14:46.06
That's the my shoulder.

2362
02:14:46.06 --> 02:14:48.06
Oh, that was been, that was like six months ago or something.

2363
02:14:48.06 --> 02:14:49.06
It was a long time ago.

2364
02:14:49.06 --> 02:14:51.82
I was dealing with it, but finally it's coming back around.

2365
02:14:51.82 --> 02:14:53.82
Yeah, shoulders pain and asthma.

2366
02:14:53.82 --> 02:14:55.58
Yeah, you got to do the maintenance man.

2367
02:14:55.58 --> 02:14:57.38
You got to do the maintenance and I don't do enough of it.

2368
02:14:57.38 --> 02:14:58.70
Need to do more of it.

2369
02:14:58.70 --> 02:14:59.70
Yeah.

2370
02:14:59.70 --> 02:15:01.22
Yeah, but yeah, on it, go there.

2371
02:15:01.22 --> 02:15:05.50
That's that you can get some cool workout stuff and actually good travel workout stuff, too.

2372
02:15:05.50 --> 02:15:10.06
Like those were, well, you all said this, I know, but you know, I'm slowly coming to the realization.

2373
02:15:10.06 --> 02:15:12.02
You travel with rings.

2374
02:15:12.02 --> 02:15:13.26
But it opens up your whole travel.

2375
02:15:13.26 --> 02:15:14.26
You can change your, yeah.

2376
02:15:14.26 --> 02:15:15.26
Yeah.

2377
02:15:15.26 --> 02:15:16.26
Change that.

2378
02:15:16.26 --> 02:15:19.02
You know, if you're working out too and you're working on that deadlift.

2379
02:15:19.02 --> 02:15:25.42
One thing you can do is if you probably, if you're stuck at like a 4,000 pound deadlift plateau,

2380
02:15:25.42 --> 02:15:26.58
we can't accept that.

2381
02:15:26.58 --> 02:15:32.50
You're a jockel white tea and it comes with a guaranteed, I don't know what kind of guarantee.

2382
02:15:32.50 --> 02:15:34.70
So you can deadlift 8,000 pounds immediately.

2383
02:15:34.70 --> 02:15:37.26
Probably take you like four sips.

2384
02:15:37.26 --> 02:15:42.54
If you can't, if you can't deadlift 8,000 pounds after drinking jockel white tea, either

2385
02:15:42.54 --> 02:15:49.10
the ones in a can or the ones in a tea bag, that you can get them on Amazon.

2386
02:15:49.10 --> 02:15:52.62
If you can't, if your deadlift is an 8,000 pounds after that, just drink more.

2387
02:15:52.62 --> 02:15:53.62
And you'll get them.

2388
02:15:53.62 --> 02:15:54.62
Just get that.

2389
02:15:54.62 --> 02:15:55.62
That's interesting.

2390
02:15:55.62 --> 02:15:56.62
Also got some books.

2391
02:15:56.62 --> 02:16:02.50
Obviously the way the warrior kid books, that the first one's way the warrior kid, the second

2392
02:16:02.50 --> 02:16:03.50
one is Mark's mission.

2393
02:16:03.50 --> 02:16:05.14
Which is the best book.

2394
02:16:05.14 --> 02:16:06.50
And I'm going to say it.

2395
02:16:06.50 --> 02:16:08.14
It's a bold statement.

2396
02:16:08.14 --> 02:16:10.62
In fact, I was debating whether or not to actually say it out loud.

2397
02:16:10.62 --> 02:16:13.18
But that's the best book in the world straight out.

2398
02:16:13.18 --> 02:16:14.18
Mark's mission.

2399
02:16:14.18 --> 02:16:17.18
The second one.

2400
02:16:17.18 --> 02:16:18.18
You, okay.

2401
02:16:18.18 --> 02:16:20.18
So I'm reading it to, we just finished it.

2402
02:16:20.18 --> 02:16:21.18
Oh, we could go.

2403
02:16:21.18 --> 02:16:22.50
Oh, this is your first time finishing it.

2404
02:16:22.50 --> 02:16:23.50
Finishing it.

2405
02:16:23.50 --> 02:16:24.50
Yes.

2406
02:16:24.50 --> 02:16:25.50
We could understand.

2407
02:16:25.50 --> 02:16:27.66
So, oh, because we jumped around to another book.

2408
02:16:27.66 --> 02:16:28.66
It's a long story.

2409
02:16:28.66 --> 02:16:30.66
But nonetheless, yeah, so finished it.

2410
02:16:30.66 --> 02:16:32.38
So you know why though?

2411
02:16:32.38 --> 02:16:34.50
Now that I'm searching my feelings.

2412
02:16:34.50 --> 02:16:36.50
It'll talk about this later.

2413
02:16:36.50 --> 02:16:37.50
The first thing.

2414
02:16:37.50 --> 02:16:40.54
It starts to address a little bit more sophisticated.

2415
02:16:40.54 --> 02:16:44.14
Issues that you can go through, you know, even though when you think you got it figured

2416
02:16:44.14 --> 02:16:48.26
out, you know, you're taking your jits now and you can do pull ups and all this stuff.

2417
02:16:48.26 --> 02:16:52.66
What do you, so to address those little bit more advanced issues sophisticated.

2418
02:16:52.66 --> 02:16:59.70
But like the depth of which like these issues go and the way you got to solve them

2419
02:16:59.70 --> 02:17:04.58
are like the way it's simplified and broken down to kids or whoever's reading it.

2420
02:17:04.58 --> 02:17:06.46
Because it's quite frankly, it's broken down to me.

2421
02:17:06.46 --> 02:17:10.50
In this case, it's like it's pretty, we'll just say it's pretty interesting.

2422
02:17:10.50 --> 02:17:16.34
But at the same time, you glorify things like hard work right in a way that it actually

2423
02:17:16.34 --> 02:17:18.06
makes the kid want to work hard.

2424
02:17:18.06 --> 02:17:20.22
So it's like, yeah, getting a job.

2425
02:17:20.22 --> 02:17:24.18
Like go Mollons and pull weeds by the way, which if we, you know, we all know that when

2426
02:17:24.18 --> 02:17:26.62
you did that as a kid, you're like, no, we don't want to do that.

2427
02:17:26.62 --> 02:17:29.86
Boeing weeds is a form of punishment in my house.

2428
02:17:29.86 --> 02:17:32.10
Yeah, exactly right at this time.

2429
02:17:32.10 --> 02:17:36.82
After reading that part, my daughter, by the way, she wants to pull weed.

2430
02:17:36.82 --> 02:17:39.74
Yeah, she's, she's salty because she doesn't have a job mowing long,

2431
02:17:39.74 --> 02:17:41.42
long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long weed.

2432
02:17:41.42 --> 02:17:42.42
Yeah.

2433
02:17:42.42 --> 02:17:44.54
And he makes like for he's like $40, it made $40.

2434
02:17:44.54 --> 02:17:45.78
Right, like, estimation point.

2435
02:17:45.78 --> 02:17:47.30
She's like, oh my gosh, you made $40.

2436
02:17:47.30 --> 02:17:48.26
I want to make $40.

2437
02:17:48.26 --> 02:17:52.94
You know, just the way it's laid out how simple, but, you know, I'm really, I'm getting

2438
02:17:52.94 --> 02:17:57.58
into it and it, I see it affecting it, my daughter.

2439
02:17:57.58 --> 02:18:00.54
So then it moves on to the jujitsu part and this part affected me.

2440
02:18:00.54 --> 02:18:05.10
You know, it's like, well, let's face it like that's why when you get nervous in jujitsu

2441
02:18:05.10 --> 02:18:06.10
with tournaments or whatever.

2442
02:18:06.10 --> 02:18:09.26
Like, there was, I remember when I was competing and strangely I was competing a lot.

2443
02:18:09.26 --> 02:18:13.26
Like every, like maybe two, three weeks, there was a tournament back then.

2444
02:18:13.26 --> 02:18:17.58
Wasn't as often as no, but, and I would be competing.

2445
02:18:17.58 --> 02:18:23.62
But every single one seems like we're driving there and if like my wife who is, I think

2446
02:18:23.62 --> 02:18:27.78
my girlfriend at the time and my brother whoever's driving, because if they're talking about

2447
02:18:27.78 --> 02:18:31.30
other stuff, I'm like getting mad at them because I'm like, don't you realize our

2448
02:18:31.30 --> 02:18:32.30
fraternity?

2449
02:18:32.30 --> 02:18:36.02
It's like that idea, you know, and I'm like, I don't behave that way, but that's the thing

2450
02:18:36.02 --> 02:18:37.02
on my mind.

2451
02:18:37.02 --> 02:18:42.58
It's a tangible small but tangible part of my mind is like hoping that like the gym

2452
02:18:42.58 --> 02:18:44.18
burnt down when we got there.

2453
02:18:44.18 --> 02:18:46.98
Like, I just don't want it, you know, it's like that, it's weird.

2454
02:18:46.98 --> 02:18:50.82
But then the way like you lay out, because Mark didn't want to compete in tournament.

2455
02:18:50.82 --> 02:18:53.86
And the way you lay out and you really, it's a call out is what it is.

2456
02:18:53.86 --> 02:18:58.66
It's like you're calling out, you're like, I'm afraid, but you're not afraid of jujitsu.

2457
02:18:58.66 --> 02:19:01.26
You do jujitsu every day, full speed by the way.

2458
02:19:01.26 --> 02:19:04.50
And you're not afraid of jujitsu, you're afraid of losing.

2459
02:19:04.50 --> 02:19:05.50
And guess what?

2460
02:19:05.50 --> 02:19:06.50
Okay.

2461
02:19:06.50 --> 02:19:07.50
Yes.

2462
02:19:07.50 --> 02:19:08.86
You really hit me anyway.

2463
02:19:08.86 --> 02:19:13.66
And then from there to me from then on, it was like, and how it culminates, good man.

2464
02:19:13.66 --> 02:19:15.30
It's straight out the best looking the world.

2465
02:19:15.30 --> 02:19:16.30
I'll give it to you.

2466
02:19:16.30 --> 02:19:17.30
Don't want to.

2467
02:19:17.30 --> 02:19:19.02
Never mind, corn mac, Mac, McCarthy.

2468
02:19:19.02 --> 02:19:21.14
Never mind about face.

2469
02:19:21.14 --> 02:19:22.14
Way to worry, kid.

2470
02:19:22.14 --> 02:19:26.02
They also got the discipline equals freedom field manual.

2471
02:19:26.02 --> 02:19:28.38
How to get after it for adults.

2472
02:19:28.38 --> 02:19:30.06
And actually a lot of kids read this book.

2473
02:19:30.06 --> 02:19:31.06
That's where they graduate.

2474
02:19:31.06 --> 02:19:33.58
They graduate from warrior kid.

2475
02:19:33.58 --> 02:19:35.46
I talked to a lot of parents and they're like, oh yeah.

2476
02:19:35.46 --> 02:19:41.22
Once, you know, now he's 14, he just read discipline equals freedom field manual.

2477
02:19:41.22 --> 02:19:42.22
So that's the graduate.

2478
02:19:42.22 --> 02:19:44.94
Can we imagine if you had that book when you're 14?

2479
02:19:44.94 --> 02:19:45.94
Game changer.

2480
02:19:45.94 --> 02:19:46.94
Game changer.

2481
02:19:46.94 --> 02:19:47.94
Right.

2482
02:19:47.94 --> 02:19:48.94
Anyone.

2483
02:19:48.94 --> 02:19:49.94
I'll tell you right now.

2484
02:19:49.94 --> 02:19:50.94
I'll tell you where you're.

2485
02:19:50.94 --> 02:19:51.94
The one.

2486
02:19:51.94 --> 02:19:52.94
Yeah.

2487
02:19:52.94 --> 02:19:53.94
Yeah.

2488
02:19:53.94 --> 02:19:54.94
No, the feedback that I get from.

2489
02:19:54.94 --> 02:19:59.22
But it's the same kind of feedback I get from the kids from the field manual.

2490
02:19:59.22 --> 02:20:03.58
Of people that are like, hey, I read this every day.

2491
02:20:03.58 --> 02:20:05.98
I read two pages this every day.

2492
02:20:05.98 --> 02:20:07.54
So I can keep my mind right.

2493
02:20:07.54 --> 02:20:08.54
Yeah.

2494
02:20:08.54 --> 02:20:09.54
And that's how that works.

2495
02:20:09.54 --> 02:20:12.82
Like, that's the one you refer back to every day or every day or every day or whatever.

2496
02:20:12.82 --> 02:20:13.82
Yeah.

2497
02:20:13.82 --> 02:20:15.10
That guy hit me up on Twitter.

2498
02:20:15.10 --> 02:20:16.10
Remember that story?

2499
02:20:16.10 --> 02:20:17.46
It's all about being a yo-semba-ty.

2500
02:20:17.46 --> 02:20:18.46
Yeah.

2501
02:20:18.46 --> 02:20:19.46
And the dude was in the river.

2502
02:20:19.46 --> 02:20:20.46
Sure.

2503
02:20:20.46 --> 02:20:23.50
And he's like, I was like, I'll recognize me and I was getting all fired up with him.

2504
02:20:23.50 --> 02:20:25.62
And he was like, I'm here to get my mind right.

2505
02:20:25.62 --> 02:20:26.62
And I was like, yeah.

2506
02:20:26.62 --> 02:20:28.62
Anyways, that's all.

2507
02:20:28.62 --> 02:20:30.82
The guy's friend hit me up on Twitter.

2508
02:20:30.82 --> 02:20:33.38
And that dude's name is MF.

2509
02:20:33.38 --> 02:20:34.38
That's his name.

2510
02:20:34.38 --> 02:20:35.38
His name is MF.

2511
02:20:35.38 --> 02:20:36.38
MF.

2512
02:20:36.38 --> 02:20:37.38
METH.

2513
02:20:37.38 --> 02:20:38.38
Oh, like the drug.

2514
02:20:38.38 --> 02:20:39.38
Straight up.

2515
02:20:39.38 --> 02:20:40.38
Yeah, got it.

2516
02:20:40.38 --> 02:20:42.38
He was not a meth user.

2517
02:20:42.38 --> 02:20:44.38
That just happens to be his name.

2518
02:20:44.38 --> 02:20:45.38
Gotcha.

2519
02:20:45.38 --> 02:20:46.38
Uh, okay.

2520
02:20:46.38 --> 02:20:48.38
Then also extreme ownership.

2521
02:20:48.38 --> 02:20:52.38
Obviously, that's the first book wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.

2522
02:20:52.38 --> 02:20:56.10
And we followed that book up very recently with a book called The dichotomy.

2523
02:20:56.10 --> 02:20:57.10
A leadership.

2524
02:20:57.10 --> 02:20:58.10
There's a million interviews on it.

2525
02:20:58.10 --> 02:21:00.46
We talked about on this podcast.

2526
02:21:00.46 --> 02:21:07.82
That book is going to really help leaders finish out strong.

2527
02:21:07.82 --> 02:21:14.94
And then of course, coming out November, order it now, Mikey and the dragons.

2528
02:21:14.94 --> 02:21:17.58
Eshelon front, that's my leadership consultancy.

2529
02:21:17.58 --> 02:21:18.90
We saw problems through leadership.

2530
02:21:18.90 --> 02:21:19.90
It's me.

2531
02:21:19.90 --> 02:21:20.90
It's life Babin.

2532
02:21:20.90 --> 02:21:21.90
It's JP to now.

2533
02:21:21.90 --> 02:21:22.90
It's Dave Burke.

2534
02:21:22.90 --> 02:21:26.18
It's Flynn Cochrane, Mike's Relly, and Mike Bahma.

2535
02:21:26.18 --> 02:21:28.38
Don't call a speaking agency.

2536
02:21:28.38 --> 02:21:35.18
If you want us to come and talk to you or your company, email us info at echelonfront.com.

2537
02:21:35.18 --> 02:21:39.38
Muster 006 in San Francisco, October 17th and 18th.

2538
02:21:39.38 --> 02:21:44.22
Solda, sorry.

2539
02:21:44.22 --> 02:21:51.18
Last thing, we've got EF Overwatch, which is connecting spec ops veterans and companies

2540
02:21:51.18 --> 02:21:55.30
that need experienced leaders ready to go.

2541
02:21:55.30 --> 02:22:01.22
If you're a company that needs leadership, leadership that understands and operates within

2542
02:22:01.22 --> 02:22:06.26
the principles of extreme ownership, go to EF Overwatch.com.

2543
02:22:06.26 --> 02:22:14.86
If you're a spec ops, that if you're a former combat aviator, go to EF Overwatch.com and

2544
02:22:14.86 --> 02:22:18.50
we will connect you to together.

2545
02:22:18.50 --> 02:22:24.14
And if anyone out there has questions or answers for us, you can find us out there on

2546
02:22:24.14 --> 02:22:33.38
the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram, and on that.

2547
02:22:33.38 --> 02:22:37.98
That goes at echelchalls and I am at Jocca Willink and thanks to all military police law

2548
02:22:37.98 --> 02:22:43.18
enforcement, correctional officers, fire fighters, border patrol, paramedics, all

2549
02:22:43.18 --> 02:22:44.18
first responders.

2550
02:22:44.18 --> 02:22:45.46
It was great meeting.

2551
02:22:45.46 --> 02:22:50.38
So many of you at Role Call, it was just awesome to meet you all.

2552
02:22:50.38 --> 02:22:54.70
Send it up on the other events I've done the past couple weeks, the book signings and what

2553
02:22:54.70 --> 02:22:59.86
not knowing that you all are out there holding the line and watching our six and protecting

2554
02:22:59.86 --> 02:23:01.82
our flanks is awesome.

2555
02:23:01.82 --> 02:23:05.98
And I'll tell you what, I do not take it for granted.

2556
02:23:05.98 --> 02:23:10.06
I do not take it for granted that you're there and no one should.

2557
02:23:10.06 --> 02:23:17.78
So thanks to you all for doing what you do and for everyone else, that is out there.

2558
02:23:17.78 --> 02:23:25.62
Remember the way and remember that you can use it everywhere in everything that you do.

2559
02:23:25.62 --> 02:23:32.58
So find the enemies' weak points, attack the enemy violently, be bold and decisive,

2560
02:23:32.58 --> 02:23:38.90
seize and hold the initiative, keep the enemy under constant pressure and off balance

2561
02:23:38.90 --> 02:23:45.70
and be fully prepared to accomplish the mission regardless of the conditions under which

2562
02:23:45.70 --> 02:23:50.26
the war begins.

2563
02:23:50.26 --> 02:24:00.58
And of course you do all those things by stepping out into the fray and getting after it.

2564
02:24:00.58 --> 02:24:19.82
Until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
