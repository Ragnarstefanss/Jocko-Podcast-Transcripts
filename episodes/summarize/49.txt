I hear that a lot that when you know especially when when I first got into reading I Well more so than hear it I kind of think about that where I could be like hey, you know if I come across Situation where I'm gonna apply some knowledge that I learned and if I'm in a situation where I got to Come day the the merits of that knowledge, you know It does feel weird to be like hey the book said it this way and more like you're just this like blind Exactly right so you can you know you can Look at them for like shoulders time like three to I don't know eight minutes or something or if you know if you know someone who's like Hey, you were asking me this question remember You send them that bowl advice like shareable advice kind of thing Anyway, that's like what you're doing there. You know that you need to practice No man in this not to mention just all that like input they like just firing it, you know like on movies They got to be like one hand, you know whatever boom boom A more accurate representation of how we would go is like you know the kind of movies where the girl They they totally do mean women a lot of times when they the girl grabs the gun Yeah, because you guys both know the drilling part of it, you know, but Those you know is the one million different other elements in light like surfing you know like you know when you first take surfing They're like hey, you know, let's do it on the sand when there's and there's it's just that's basically drilling Oh, and they get after it like they like Ali will be Like if someone's from I forget where but it was like Dale King was one of them or show right like gocubs or you know Like if you that's your if you're in Chicago or something should be like gocubs and Show right in a personal message. like Okay, do the armor you know do the whole transition to the arm bar and then you know just drill that when you first learn the arm bar It's gonna have more value because you have to just know the fundamental movement of the arm bar Just like how you said like it's gonna be different when you do it life. That's kind of like a Like Data it's like you got to remember that you know because you know all like you're on two different pages You know, Yeah, like yeah, because she's like you kind of feel like you know the person You know because really when you think about it it's like You know, I'll be we'll use it like I got a go, but you know Yeah, that's good and you know these questions what I liked about him is he's saying hey, you know Basically put the extreme ownership attitude into the UFC cage and let's see how it does and Yeah, that that point you made where I think it's probably just had it really a little bit when you treat your wife like a team guy, you know like how cuz That's how you used it like bonding with people you like and also in a way. I don't know then you got to go out to the actual ways and then the waves That's you know, it's different and again these principles from GJ2 are they applied to everything that you do it and when you're going through a leadership situation If you've seen it before if you've seen this kind of person's added like I just told that story about hey, it's the guy that's learned something The first way he learned it in the seal teams is the way he believed it show is big One side experience that it was much easier for me to handle you know, so anytime you can open up your mind and pay attention on what's going on around you And he grabbed that thing like he was picking up a like he was picking up a A pair of socks it was like no factor boom walked over picked up the snake whacked it against the tree I said okay, that knows how to deal with snakes and it's the same thing here people are snakes Does that mean you just avoid them and you're not gonna play the game and the worst thing You know what you don't do with the snake? I don't think they really do but the adrenaline rush takes Experience to manage What's a good what's a good approach on you know on the mat to let them know that they're being reckless and wasting energy without sounding like a douche All right, so question one the ratio of drilling to sparring I'm probably not the best person to ask this question because I like to roll nobody's the best person asked that question Maybe That's what I do control them put them you know Force them to accept their fate and that will help them move down the path towards relaxation now if you're a lower-bout You can either Fight to the death which is fine I mean kind of join in their mayhem and if you want to do that that's okay, or you can work your technique right and get dominated so so Guy comes in and you know you talk about the same level, but he's a lot stronger than you He's going crazy and you just go okay, you know I'm just gonna work my technique the best of my yeah, the point is like What you would think is a common Charlie horse like with your friend or at school Whatever like oh like an elbow where you punch it or even you need it or whatever Is different than like the kind of Charlie horse that will be effective in They're good check to Zad if you like I'm quite support that like I want to know Keep yourself kind of warm or like it you know as far as when you work out It's tough or just wearing them We watched the fights and the guys were in this specific position You know standing kind of from the back there and he and he asked He's like hey Couldn't he just like throw knees and give him like the meanest Charlie horse right there and then agree like It's not we'll say it's not condescending or anything Yeah, they just like there's so there's so there's they've been in that situation so many times Yeah, they've been in that situation so many times that it doesn't matter They you're doing something they already thought of that they've done they've been in that position Like there's a position in GJ2 for those either don't know there's a position in GJ2 called a 50 50 Which we originally called Cochoreco, which Dean kind of I would say started because He did it in ADCC in 2003 and it was a position that we were doing all the time at that time But no one else was doing it and now a bunch of people do it Ryan Hall's made it famous and he's the one I think he Going out and who going to phrase 50 50 I'm like, yeah, that sounds so easy, but you know I realize it's one like I care about the person and they'd be passive aggressive like or if I care about like their opinion I say that you had to offend them No, no, no, no, it's not not in that way. That's nothing this is nothing new where I think I need a job, you know, dang there's no job that here or whatever and that's kind of an example of that, you know where Don't look at it like a job needs to be presented to you, you know, you have to kind of you need to maneuver Yeah, and I said hey, man, you know I don't know you don't tell you just you know normally when you roll you feel like You know about this level
