00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 314 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening.
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:20.000 I go. Good evening. The machine rolls on. That's what happens. When your time is up and you leave, the machine is going to roll on.
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:36.000 And that can be hard on your brain, on your ego. It can also just be hard because you love the teams. You care about the boys.
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:54.000 And when you leave, you worry about the void that is there. And you think, who's going to fill that void? And you wonder if you did a good enough job passing on what you learned.
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:09.000 And that's rough. That was one of the hardest things for me when I left when I got out of the Navy. Because my whole life, my whole life had been in the sealed teams. I was full on institutionalized by the sealed teams.
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:22.000 I didn't know anything else in the world. And I couldn't help but feel that I was leaving them hanging, leaving my friend hanging that I was letting them down.
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:35.000 But the reality is that the machine rolls on. And there are guys that are ready to step up and take your place and take things to the next level and do a better job.
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:48.000 And carry the torch and take the fight to the enemy and uphold the traditions and uphold the reputation of the teams and elevate it.
00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:04.000 And so, because this next generation of frog men step up the machine rolls on. And I am lucky enough to have one of those frog men here with me tonight Carlos Mendez.
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:20.000 And I am lucky enough to have one of those little frog men who have been here. And I am lucky enough to have one of those little frog men who have been here.
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:37.000 And Carlos, thanks for joining us, man. Pleasure to be here. What year did you check in a team one? 2005. Okay, so it was like I checked in a team one in 1991.
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000 No fun one. It was still no fun when I got there.
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:55.000 Well, we'll get there. Let's go back to where you came from because damn, I mean it's a weird ride, right? It's a, it's you got a, you got an interesting background story. So you're not even, you're not born to America.
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:07.000 No, that was born in Guatemala. So, you know, you know, you know, I'll even start before that.
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000 So my father passed away when my mom was pregnant with me. Oh, great. So yeah, actually she got the news on the day of her baby shower.
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000 What a die from car accident.
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000 Yeah.
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:34.000 So I was born in Guatemala to a single mom, obviously. And, you know, my grandparents, my, my dad was their favorite son.
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:48.000 So when my mom had me, I was the favorite grandchild. And they had, they had a lot of, they wanted a lot of control over the way she raised me. And it was this conflict back and forth.
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000 And, you know, when I talked to my mom, she said, ultimately, that's what.
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.000 I drove her to the decision to immigrate to the US. She's like, I need to get you away from here because I was, I was spoiled rock.
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000 From what I hear, I was an absolute terror. And I can get away with it because grandma was there to protect me. And yeah, she used to babysit me. My mom would drop me off in the mornings.
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:28.000 And it was funny because the things that you remember, just so weird, I remember, we would go get gas in in Guatemala. You know, people don't have a lot of money. So if you filled up a full gas tank, you got a baby chick.
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000 Okay.
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:39.000 Yeah. So my mom, you know, filled the gas tank up and we would get a baby chick. So I remember I would drive back to my grandma's house. And I would have that baby chick. And we had all kinds of them, you know, from all times we filled up the gas tank.
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000 So, any chasing chasing a bunch of chickens and chicks on the backyard.
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000 It's interesting that your mom, she got to be a pretty interesting human because you would figure, here she is single mom.
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:04.000 And she actually has this kid, you, that is getting soon over by the grandparents. It seems like a single mom would be like, thank God these grandparents are here to help me through this.
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:17.000 And I'm totally, I'm kind of set now, right? I got like backup as opposed to no backup, which you know, your dad was dead. I mean, that's, but she, but she just thought, oh, he's being spoiled.
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000 We're out here.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000 Oh, yeah, my mom's a gangster. She is very old school Hispanic, just very, you know, disciplined.
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000 Screw your feelings kind of thing. It's always your fault kind of thing.
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000 I remember any time I got in trouble, she said, would you do it was your fault?
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000 I'm like everybody else's parents stand up for them. I'm like, what would you do? I know, I know was your fault.
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000 Somewhere another was your fault. So that's why I was kind of joke around with JP that I had extreme ownership.
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000 Yeah, basically. But yeah, that's what drove her decision to leave Guatemala and suit US.
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000 So how old were you when you came to the US? Do you remember, I guess you must remember to remember the class?
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000 I mean, there's, you know, things here and there that you remember, I was like four or five, but I do remember I was in school.
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000 And I remember showing up to school not being able to speak English.
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000 And my mom set me up for total success. And I say that's our classic because she would dress me up in like a college or everything was had to be like a call because you know,
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000 Guatemala, you dress nice to go to school. You have uniform.
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000 And now we were in San Francisco, not in Nice Area either.
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000 And so I'm wearing this, you know, button up shirt with some some Docker type pants that we got at the goodwill.
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000 Sure had to be tucked in. And like these alligator skin shoes.
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000 Because in Guatemala, they're cheap, you know, like all year skin shoes. So that was like the thing.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000 And she's like, you know, Guatemala, these are like a luxury.
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000 I'm like, well, over here is getting my ass kicked.
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000 Where these alligator shoes and dockers and tucked in shirt. So yeah.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000 I needless to say I ran to a lot of issues when I first showed up.
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000 Didn't speak English and dressed them like a complete door.
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000 And then, you know, the kids that I'm with are little rough around the edges.
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000 What did your mom do for work when she got her?
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000 So I remember she worked at.
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000 She worked at the school that I was at. So she can keep an eye on me as a teacher's assistant.
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000 And then after school, I remember she worked as she would clean houses.
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000 And I remember going after school, we would go to whoever's house and she would clean it.
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000 And I would do my homework while she cleaned.
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000 And if I didn't have homework, like I would help her out.
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000 And then I think like twice a week or so, she would go to English school to learn how to speak English.
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000 And I'll go with her there.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000 And if you're getting what's immersion training at school, because just showing up in there speaking all English.
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000 Oh yeah. Yeah.
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000 And it's kind of funny because when, so my mom's side of the family was already in San Francisco, Oakland, Baria.
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000 Oh, so that's why we moved there.
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000 She had her side of the family there.
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000 My dad's side of the family was the one that's saying Guatemala.
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000 Because they're actually pretty well off there.
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000 So she had that support system.
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000 And I thought it was, it was interesting how my family was like, oh, the kids need to learn how to speak English.
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000 So the kids won't make fun of them.
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000 And my mom was like, I don't care about his feelings.
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000 Like, okay, they make fun of him. So what?
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000 He's not allowed to speak English at home.
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000 Because he's going to forget Spanish.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000 He's going to learn English regardless.
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000 But I want him to remember how to speak Spanish.
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000 So at home, I wasn't allowed to speak any English.
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000 You're well as a gangster, huh?
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000 Oh, dude. She's just heartless.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000 And then, so then you end up, she ended up meeting someone else or getting married to someone else, right?
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000 Like, like, a step down showed up basically.
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000 Yep.
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000 So she actually met my stepdad in San Francisco and English school.
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000 So he was from Czechoslovakia when it was still Czechoslovakia.
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000 Yeah.
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000 And his story is pretty amazing.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000 You know, when he was in high school.
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000 So he was there when it was still under communist rule.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000 Mm-hmm.
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000 So when he tells a story, you know, he was in high school and he drew a cartoon,
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000 criticizing communism.
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000 And I guess like a week later, some men showed up.
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000 They dragged him out of school.
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000 They beat him up.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000 And then they told him, hey, when you graduate,
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000 we're going to send you to the mines and you're going to die there.
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000 You're going to work there for the rest of your life to die.
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000 So he was just like, nope, not happening.
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000 He started planning his escape.
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000 And didn't tell anybody not a soul,
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000 packed his stuff and like this green bag that he actually still had when I met him.
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000 Packed everything he had in there and ran away.
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000 And he just recently told me this story to like maybe two, three months ago.
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000 Like the actual details of how he crawled for days across the border.
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000 And somehow made it into Yugoslavia.
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000 And yeah, it's a pretty crazy story.
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000 Yeah, the when you're in those communist countries,
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000 the amount of in government in for like,
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000 it's some crazy number, like 50% of people are government informants.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000 It's a crazy number.
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000 So you're step that couldn't have told anybody because if you tell one person,
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000 you might as well just tell everybody and you're going to get rat it out.
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000 And he's already got the threats of being the mines for the rest of his life and dying there.
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000 Good lord.
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000 Yeah.
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000 Freaking savages.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000 So they end up getting married.
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000 That means that the next phase.
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000 Yeah, they start dating.
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000 And in my head, I'm thinking like, oh, sweet.
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000 I'm finally going to have a dad.
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000 You know, little did I know he was meaner than my mom.
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000 You know, I mean, he's a hard hard man.
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000 I mean, he's, you know, communist block.
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000 They grew up very, very hard up there.
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000 Life is hard.
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000 So he was hard on me.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000 So what were you doing growing up?
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000 What was it?
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000 What was a day in the life of Carlos?
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000 Let's say age 11.
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000 Oh, by that time we had, I'm not sure.
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000 I don't remember if we had already moved out to Sacramento at one point.
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000 You know, they were like, hey, you know, the barriers just to expensive.
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000 It's not a great place to raise a family.
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000 And we moved out to Sacramento.
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000 And I remember we started renting this house out that had this huge yard.
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000 Well, for me, it was huge.
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000 I hadn't seen a backyard.
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000 You know, in the same room as this guy or Oakland.
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000 And, and he just gave me a ton of chores.
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000 Like, that's what my life, so my life was I come home from school.
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000 I do chores.
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000 I do homework.
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000 And then after we dinner, you know, I wash all the dishes.
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000 I take everything off the counter, wipe them all down.
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000 Sweet mop.
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000 Like, that was something that I did every single day.
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000 And then in the backyard, I always had all kinds of chores that he had for me.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000 And I think a lot of it too had to do with he worked on.
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000 Like, he is probably the hardest working man I've ever met my life.
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000 Like, yeah, he was mean and probably growing up.
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000 I wasn't, I hated him growing up.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000 But now that I'm all grown up and I look back like man, that guy worked his ass off.
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000 Like, he did anything and everything he could do.
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000 Like, I remember he used to sell like vacuums for electrolux.
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000 He used to deliver pieces for Domino's pizza.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000 He finally got into it.
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000 I teach he tech to become a drafter.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000 So he became a drafter eventually designing like elevators or something like that.
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000 And then I remember he would do that all day.
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000 He would come home.
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000 He would take a nap and then he would go back and deliver pieces all night long.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000 You can get maybe like two, three hours of sleeping, do it all over again.
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000 So, you know, looking back now, I'm like, okay, that's why I had to do so much stuff around the house.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000 Because he just wasn't around.
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000 He was providing for the family.
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000 And when you get to like what kind of kids are you hanging out with?
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000 You play any sports or anything?
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000 No, my mom and like I said, my mom and dad were both really strict on me.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000 And the only two things that I was really allowed to do growing up,
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000 I remember were Legos and reading.
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000 So I would devour any book.
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000 I can get my hands on because we weren't allowed to watch like TV.
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000 Actually, I don't think we owned a TV for a big portion.
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000 And then finally when we did, we weren't allowed to watch a whole lot of it.
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000 They had a subscription to Reader's Digest.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000 So I would read Reader's Digest, cover to cover.
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000 As soon as it came in, I was actually the one that ripped the wrap rope and I would just start reading.
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000 And it's funny because it was actually the first time that I was exposed to the teams.
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000 Even though I didn't know it, there was an article in Reader's Digest when I was a kid.
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000 And it was something like the hardest school.
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000 You know, I don't remember exactly what the title, but it was, it talked about this gentleman who was in the army.
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000 I saw some team guys and went to Buds and he talked about his experience going to Buds.
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000 But at the time I didn't know what it was.
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000 I was just like, oh cool story.
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000 But yeah, Legos, reading, I wasn't allowed to really play with other kids because my life was like chores and homework.
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000 And my parents were both perfectionist.
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000 So, you know, I would turn in my homework and if the handwriting was sloppy, they'd do it over.
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000 Or like the dishes.
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000 Like if I do the dishes and like one of them was wrong, my stuff, I'd be like, do it more lower.
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000 No, dang it.
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000 So, that's kind of how I remember my childhood was a lot of chores.
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000 homework.
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000 And then kind of just reading a lot and playing with Legos a lot.
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000 Yes, sir.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000 Did you end up, yeah, I think you've mentioned me, you had some kind of like a little farm or something at some point?
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000 Yeah.
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000 Or like at least some little animals running around the house.
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000 Yeah, so at one point, you know, we got accepted for this program that was like for low income families,
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000 where they allowed you to build your house.
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000 And it would offset some of the costs, but it would, you know, it was like a pat to ownership.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000 Yeah, that's legit.
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000 And so my parents both applied for it.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000 We got accepted.
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000 So for a long time, that was actually a big part of my childhood too.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000 For a long time, I remember like going to school and then going to help at the construction site.
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000 My weekends, same thing.
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000 They were, they were suspended the construction site helping build our house.
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000 And when it was completed, you know, my stepdad had all kinds of stuff in the back yard.
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000 Like we had this little farm.
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000 So we had, he built like, when I say he built, I'm a mostly I built.
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000 Because my weekends were like, I remember I, he can say,
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000 Oh, I'm going to get to sleep in.
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000 And I would just hear a bang on my window like at five,
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000 30 in the morning and a 10 like, hey, get up.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000 It's time to work.
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000 I'm like, dang.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000 You know, so I go out there and we built the greenhouse.
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000 We had all kinds of fruits and vegetables.
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000 We had a compost pile.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000 So I remember digging that hole.
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000 He made him wanted it so big.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000 And I spent forever.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000 I did all our irrigation.
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000 So I dug all the holes for that.
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000 And then he got this idea for, so we had all our fruits and vegetables.
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000 So he's like, now we need our meat.
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000 So he's like, we're going to, you know, and check.
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000 We used to grab it.
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000 So I remember going to the state farm like looking at all these different rabbits.
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000 And then he's like, oh, these are the kind that you can eat.
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000 So we bought like a male rabbit and like two or three females.
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000 And we started breeding rabbits.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000 Little did I know that was going to be that's,
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000 so that's another chore now.
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000 I had like taking care of these rabbits feeding them, you know,
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000 cleaning up their poop.
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000 And then when I got the poop, I put it in the compost pile.
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000 And everything, like all the clippings from the grass and everything we grew with
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000 throwing the compost pile and now I have to get in there and like mix it up and it's miserable.
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000 But then the baby rabbits got to the to age.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000 And he's like, hey, your chore from now on.
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000 Another chore is going to be like, hey, you're going to kill the rabbits.
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000 You're going to skin them and you're going to put them in the freezer.
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000 And I'm like, well, I don't know how to kill a rabbit.
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000 He's like, you know, learn today.
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000 And he's like, well, let me know.
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000 He's like, let me know when you kill that first rabbit.
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000 Let me know and I'll show you how to skin it.
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000 So I remember being a kid because I'm looking at, I'm like, I'm holding it this part.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000 I want to say junior high.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000 Okay.
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000 So what's that?
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000 Like 12 or 13?
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000 Yeah.
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000 Something like this.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000 I'm all around 11 or 12.
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000 Okay.
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000 Because I remember being young.
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000 Because I remember the first one, I'm like, okay, I think I'm going to drown the rabbit.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000 Right.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000 So I grab a bug. Yeah. I fill it up with water.
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000 And I grab this rabbit and I put it in the bucket and it free him won't die.
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000 And now I'm crying.
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000 I remember crying because I'm like, oh my god, please die.
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000 Just die, damn it.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000 And I'm just holding it and just, like, finally, you know, the rabbit dies.
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000 And I'm just like, oh my god, that was most miserable experience ever.
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000 I'm like, I'm literally, I'm crying. I'm a kid.
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000 And so finally, I go back in. I'm like, okay, I killed the rabbit.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000 You know, I'm going to need to eat like, stop crying, Fufina.
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000 That was his nickname for me.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000 Which Fufina is, is Regan Czechoslovakian for what?
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000 It's Czechoslovakian for pussy.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000 So, you know, he shows me how to skin the rabbit.
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000 And I'm like, okay, and I'm not really paying attention because I don't drown the time.
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000 You're all on the time, bro.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000 And then he's like, raise your rabbits.
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000 So, so now he's like, okay, it's time to kill the second one.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000 And now I'm like, I'm going to do it a different way.
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000 So I'm like, I grab a two-by-four.
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000 I'm like, all right, I'm going to hit this rabbit on the head.
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000 So I grab the rabbit. I'm like, patting it.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000 You know, and then I hit it, but I kind of half has hit it.
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000 So now he's just like, torlling in my hands.
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000 And now again, I got snott running out my nose tears.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000 And I'm just like, hitting this rabbit again, like, please damn it.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000 Just die.
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000 And finally after wacking it, like a million times died.
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000 Same thing comes out, teaches me how to skin it.
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000 And then on the third rabbit, something happened.
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000 You know, something already happened.
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000 So I was like, but something happened that actually stuck with me for, for till today.
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000 Oh, actually.
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000 All right.
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000 So I remember I got this rabbit and I'm petting it.
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000 And now I'm talking to myself.
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000 And I'm like, all right, motherfucker.
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000 By the way, this is how serial killers get created.
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000 Just have a nice, full on the stock of yourself.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000 So when I told my wife the story, she's like, I get it.
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000 But I'm looking at this rabbit and I'm like, you know, talking to myself.
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000 I'm like, pop, pop myself up.
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000 I'm like, you know what?
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000 I got to commit.
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000 Like 100% commit.
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000 So I remember I grabbed that rabbit.
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000 I grabbed that two by four.
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000 And I hit it as hard as I could.
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000 And it was out.
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000 And from that point on, it's crazy.
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000 Because even in the teams, when I did something that I was a little bit scared of,
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000 or even in, you know, anything, I'm like commit.
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000 That thought has always kind of my head like, if you're scared of doing something,
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000 you've got a 100% commit or it's not going to work.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000 And then that moment, I had that epiphany.
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000 That's the 11, 12 year old kid.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000 So yeah, that's my rabbit story.
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000 So I, you know, a lot of times people ask me questions about,
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000 because I got kids in parenting and all that stuff.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000 And one thing I warn parents of, you know, if you push hard to get your kids,
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000 they're going to push back.
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000 And by the way, this isn't just with kids.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000 This is with a seal puttune.
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000 This is with a company that's with a business.
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000 You start imposing stuff on people.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000 They're going to start to push back because they're humans and humans don't like to have things imposed on them.
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000 And you can, by the way, you can impose things on people permanently.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000 But you have to like crush them.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.000 Yeah.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000 You have to continuously crush them forever.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000 And you have to be willing to go to that distance where you crush them,
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000 which is not going to produce the type of humans that you want.
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000 So was there any push back?
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000 And let me rephrase that at what age did you start to say,
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000 I'm pushing back against this stuff.
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000 I'm going to say around my sophomore year.
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000 You know, I'm 15.
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000 And, you know, like I said, my stepdad ruled with an iron fist.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000 And at that point, I'm like, you know what?
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000 I'm not scared of you anymore.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000 Because his punishments were so extreme.
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000 His punishments were like, oh, you're grounded for the weekend.
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000 It was like, the ground up for the next two months.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000 And if I messed up, it was like another month.
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000 And it was like, dude, there's like no light at the end of this tunnel.
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000 Two months when you're a kid.
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000 It's a lot of life.
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000 So yeah.
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000 So, and you know, they didn't let me play sports.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000 So I wasn't hanging around the jocks.
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000 So guess why I hung out with.
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000 I hung out with thugs.
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000 I hung out with the people that weren't the best influence on me.
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000 And I got into some trouble.
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000 You know, and I got locked away in juvenile hall.
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000 And so how old are you?
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000 15, 16 years old.
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000 And I remember when that happened because my stepdad
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000 at this point, he had actually just graduated the CHP Academy.
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000 So now he's law enforcement.
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000 Damn.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000 Yeah, he's law enforcement.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000 And I'm running around, you know,
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000 Little, little mini gang banger.
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000 Yeah, breaking the law.
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000 And at one point I got caught.
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000 I got arrested.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000 And I remember the cop bringing me in and interviewing me.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000 And I'm just like, I don't want to talk.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000 Because you know, I got that stupid mentality.
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000 I'm not, I'm no snitch.
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000 No, I'm a gangster.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000 So I don't snitch.
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000 I don't say anything.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000 And he's like, hey, it's not going to go a little.
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000 I know everybody else was singing like a bird.
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000 So it's crazy because I remember going to court.
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000 So they put me away.
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000 They call my parents and my parents like leave them there.
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000 Like you don't want to come get your kids like no.
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000 Leave them there.
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000 And I knew.
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000 And I even told the cop on like, don't bother call my parents.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000 They're going to leave me here.
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000 He's like, you were right.
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000 So anyways, I'm in court.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000 And you know, judge is like, hey, do you want an attorney?
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000 And I was like, no, I don't.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000 And he's like, are you sure?
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000 Do you know what you're doing?
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000 I'm like, yep, I don't need an attorney.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000 I was like 15 years old.
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000 I had a represet myself for the call.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000 Well, I was like, hey, I'm guilty.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000 I did it.
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000 Oh, I got you.
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000 And he's like, so you plead.
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000 I was like, I plead guilty.
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000 Like I'm not even going to fight it.
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000 And he's like, check.
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000 And he gave me my sentence.
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000 And I remember seeing my parents and no expression on their face.
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000 But I could tell like, my mom was disappointed for me.
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000 Yeah.
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000 They took me away in coughs.
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000 And I had to do my time.
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000 And you've been on the wrong way, you're in duty for me.
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000 I think I think a couple months.
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000 And that's because they were full.
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000 And honestly, I was a good respectful.
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000 I was a very honoured segment.
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000 I made.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000 But I was a respectful kid because of the way I was raised.
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000 So when I was in duty, like, you know, the correction officers are like, you're like,
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000 the politest criminal I've ever met.
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000 Did you start to see the path that you were going down at that point?
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000 And realize like, maybe this is the way it's going to end up.
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000 Yeah.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000 So, you know, having different roommates in juvenile hall kind of open my eyes.
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000 I'm like, man, I don't belong here.
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000 Like some of the kids that were in there, like one of my roommates was in there because, you know,
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000 he tried to murder this girl with his friends.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000 And they were so high off drugs that when they tried to dig, they did the whole to bury the body.
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000 They were so high that they buried the whole, like, not even a foot deep.
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000 And they put her in there and just put some dirt in there and realized you still alive.
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000 You know, I mean, those are the kind of roommates that I had.
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000 At one point, they put me in with like a kid who was in there for hate crime, like a skin head,
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000 and they're for hate crime.
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000 And you know, just being there, I'm like, dang, I don't belong here.
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000 And I felt terrible that my parents, because I knew my parents had raised me the right way.
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000 And I'm like, man, I really let them down here.
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000 So that's why I knew I was like, this is, this is not what I want to do.
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000 So, the source of that, a lot of times you people think that,
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000 but then, you know, as soon as they get out and they get back around their friends, you know,
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000 was that a good enough, like, scared straight situation that you actually,
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000 store scared straight?
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000 I wouldn't say scared straight because now I'm like, okay, I did it.
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000 It was fine.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000 In my head, I'm like, I'm hard.
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000 You know, like, I go back in the duty.
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000 Now I'm on probation and any little thing is like an automatic 10 days you go back.
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000 So when I got out, same thing, it was actually even worse now,
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000 you know, and it got to the point where I'm like, hey, you know what?
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000 I'm going to do whatever I want, whenever I want, whatever I want,
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000 and I would wait for my parents to go to bed and I would just sneak out of the house.
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000 So you kind of got emboldened.
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000 Oh, because you went in there because it wasn't really a scared straight thing.
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000 It was more like you got emboldened because you think, hey, dude,
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000 I can do what I can do if he wasn't that bad.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000 Yep, because I don't know.
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000 No factor.
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000 I'll get out.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000 And you actually got, you actually got worse.
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000 So I stopped committing crimes.
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000 But I was going now.
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000 I just wanted to hang out with my friends, honestly, because it was just so strict.
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000 And where I made my mistake is this is around the time where cell phones started coming out.
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000 So I would, you know, my parents went to bed early too.
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000 And they would put me to bed like an eight o'clock.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000 I don't know if teenagers put me to bed at eight o'clock.
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000 But at the time of my life.
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000 To cool me, yeah.
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000 Put me to bed early, you know, because the earlier you put me in the early,
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000 I'm leaving.
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000 So I would wait for them to go to bed.
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000 I would go to the living room.
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000 I would grab my dad's cell phone.
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000 And then I would roll out.
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000 And now I'm the only kid like Roman Brown, like with a cell phone.
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000 I'm like, yeah, let's call so and so and so and so and so and so like, you know,
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000 until the cell phone bill came out.
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000 I didn't know that because I didn't know how cell phones were.
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000 Yeah, because back then, this is in the 90s.
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000 Oh, yeah.
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000 So yeah.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000 So you get your target charge per minute per call.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000 Oh yeah.
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000 It wasn't cheap either.
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000 No, it was like a dollar a minute.
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000 Yeah, or some crazy like that.
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000 Yeah, so my dad blew a casket when he saw that bill and
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000 all his story, it was just this constant back and forth between him and I.
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000 And it got to point when I told him, I'm like, hey, I'm not scared to you.
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000 I'm going to do whatever I want whenever I want.
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000 Like what do you do?
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.000 Meet me?
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000 You're you're crowned me.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000 I'm already grounded for a life.
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000 And so at this time,
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000 I'm still getting in trouble for smaller things in my probation officer.
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000 It was like, hey, listen, you're like at the point where we're just going to
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000 put you away to your 18.
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000 I was like, oh, okay.
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000 And I had a teacher at the time that I had built a great relationship with.
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000 ship with. He was like a life skills class,
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000 way to you had like right checks, pay your bills,
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.24 you know, stuff like that. And him and I had built a good relationship and I don't know how he got
00:26:42.24 --> 00:26:47.28 wind of it, but he knew the judge or whatever and he was like, hey, you know, he's a good kid.
00:26:47.68 --> 00:26:51.60 He just, he's got a situation at home where he doesn't get along with the stepdad and
00:26:52.40 --> 00:26:56.96 and the judge is like, well, if you think he's such a good kid, then you adopt him. And he said, okay,
00:26:56.96 --> 00:27:04.96 he adopted me and at that point, like, I think my stepdad was like at the end of his, you know,
00:27:05.20 --> 00:27:09.84 his way, he's just like, I can't, I can't handle this kid. He's like, go, and he signed a way.
00:27:10.88 --> 00:27:15.36 So you're 16, 17 at this point? 17, yes, 17.
00:27:15.36 --> 00:27:18.64 So you're going to basically, you're senior year. You're senior year of high school. You're going to
00:27:19.20 --> 00:27:24.16 live with your teacher. Yeah. So I lived with him and it was, uh,
00:27:24.16 --> 00:27:28.48 what was the deal with this teacher? Do you just like the coolest teacher ever? I don't know. So he was
00:27:28.48 --> 00:27:33.44 very religious. Like very him and his wife were very religious. They had five kids. They had raised
00:27:33.44 --> 00:27:40.40 them all to be very like successful people. Like they were just good people. But in my head, I'm like,
00:27:40.40 --> 00:27:46.16 what is this guy thinking? Because I wouldn't let some little thug move in with me. But honestly,
00:27:46.16 --> 00:27:51.04 when I moved in with him, I was so grateful that I told him, I'm like, hey, this is your house,
00:27:51.04 --> 00:27:56.80 your rules, and I'll follow them. And I didn't give him like a peep of trouble because I was so grateful
00:27:57.68 --> 00:28:02.08 for what he had done. And he treated me, he treated me like an adult for the first time.
00:28:03.12 --> 00:28:06.48 You know, he was just like, hey, if you're going to go out, just let me know who you're with,
00:28:06.48 --> 00:28:11.92 what time you've been back. And for me, that was like, what? You know, let me go out with my friend.
00:28:11.92 --> 00:28:16.56 They always something that I wasn't allowed to do before. So I was so grateful for that.
00:28:16.56 --> 00:28:20.80 I'm like, do as a great thing. I don't want to mess it up and you didn't hear a peep from me.
00:28:20.80 --> 00:28:24.16 I'm gonna be the rest of the year. My guy was on my best behavior with him.
00:28:25.04 --> 00:28:26.48 Are you getting good grades in school?
00:28:27.12 --> 00:28:30.40 Yeah, so actually, that's the funny thing, because I actually did really well in school.
00:28:30.88 --> 00:28:35.20 Even this whole time. And it was funny, because I had my probation officer required like a
00:28:35.20 --> 00:28:39.76 progress report. So that's how he got a wind of it. Because the teachers would look at me
00:28:39.76 --> 00:28:43.84 and be like, dude, you're good kid, you get good grades. What do you feeling this out for?
00:28:43.84 --> 00:28:47.68 I'm like my probation officer. Yeah, they would look at me over. Yeah.
00:28:47.68 --> 00:28:53.84 Yeah. And so there were a couple of teachers actually during that time that had a big influence on
00:28:53.84 --> 00:29:00.24 the one of them's name is Bobby prior. He's prior Navy vet. And he talked about Navy seals too.
00:29:00.64 --> 00:29:04.96 And he had a big influence on me as well. And I remember him telling stories about, you know,
00:29:04.96 --> 00:29:08.48 when he was in the Navy, and he told me the story that stuck with me for a long time about these two
00:29:08.48 --> 00:29:13.04 seals. They were on the beach and they got to fight with some biker dudes. And they just got back
00:29:13.04 --> 00:29:17.44 back and back and got after it. And he's like these bikers were laid out. And he just talked about how bad
00:29:17.44 --> 00:29:21.84 ass Navy seals were. But I still didn't make that connection, you know what I mean?
00:29:21.84 --> 00:29:26.64 The connection being that this is something you could actually do with your life. Correct. Yeah. I was just like,
00:29:26.64 --> 00:29:31.44 oh, that's cool. You know, so between him and the other teacher that I lived with,
00:29:32.88 --> 00:29:36.40 they were a big influence on me in a different way. Like, I might, you know,
00:29:36.40 --> 00:29:39.92 my stepdad taught me a lot of things that I'm super grateful how to be tough, how to be, you know,
00:29:39.92 --> 00:29:46.56 work ethic, but they had like a softer, more empathetic mentoring. I think that's a better with.
00:29:46.56 --> 00:29:52.32 They were more mentoring me. Yeah. I know the, um, well, here's your, your dad saying,
00:29:52.32 --> 00:29:55.52 hey, you can't go out with your friends or sorry, your stepdad saying you can't go out with your
00:29:55.52 --> 00:30:00.08 friends, et cetera, your mom's super strict. And it makes you want to not do what they're telling
00:30:00.08 --> 00:30:03.36 you to do. Oh, I'm going to the percent. When they impose things on you, making it want to do it,
00:30:03.36 --> 00:30:07.76 this other dude says, hey, you do what you want. Just, you know, just let me know what you're doing.
00:30:07.76 --> 00:30:15.28 And you all of a sudden want to follow the rules. It's like, so such simple psychology on human beings,
00:30:15.28 --> 00:30:18.80 when you impose things on people, they don't like it. When you give them freedom, they're going
00:30:18.80 --> 00:30:24.08 to take advantage of it. And you know, positive way, I don't hear something interesting. Like,
00:30:24.08 --> 00:30:29.52 I have grown kids now. Everyone that's not grown, but my other kids are, you know, uh, how
00:30:29.52 --> 00:30:38.88 122, 20, and 18, they didn't have curfews. Like, like, I just be like, oh, yep, cool. Oh, you know,
00:30:38.88 --> 00:30:44.08 go out. This is when they were 13 years old, 15 years old. I'd say, okay, you know, let me know
00:30:44.08 --> 00:30:48.96 where you're going. Sometimes, hey, you know, when you're going to be back, you come back tonight.
00:30:48.96 --> 00:30:53.76 And I just let them do what they want to do. And they all turn it out. They all are fine, you know,
00:30:53.76 --> 00:30:55.76 which
00:30:57.12 --> 00:31:00.08 I mean you're like studying then they all
00:31:01.28 --> 00:31:11.12 You're like I mean they're all good kid. I mean they're all they all actually all they all good kids. They all like you know are on really good pass in life and I never now if you were to step
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.44 There was some incidents that took place along the way some some
00:31:15.44 --> 00:31:21.76 Things that needed some corrective measures need to be imposed from time to time if things got a little bit too far out of line and
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.52 That happened a few times
00:31:23.52 --> 00:31:28.000 But then it was like oh they'd get back in line and realize and then I would just give them kind of given their freedom back
00:31:28.24 --> 00:31:32.68 But you know what come one of the key things is that you said is and I tell this to people all the time
00:31:33.20 --> 00:31:34.88 Treat them like adults
00:31:34.88 --> 00:31:40.32 Especially when they're in that age. This is a trick to this is a little trick to this. There's an age where oh
00:31:40.64 --> 00:31:45.04 Your 14 years old. Oh, you think you can you want to be you want to be an adult. Okay cool. Guess what adults have
00:31:45.04 --> 00:31:50.96 Jobs guess what adults do pay bills. They pay rent. They pay for their cell phone. They pay for their food
00:31:50.96 --> 00:31:54.32 So you want to be treated like an adult you want to do it every aren't cool. I can treat you to like an adult
00:31:55.60 --> 00:32:00.60 You'll rent or you know you need to pay for food and all that stuff and they realize really quick
00:32:00.60 --> 00:32:02.08 That's a real good
00:32:02.08 --> 00:32:05.68 Appreciation tool they want to make somebody appreciate what they've got
00:32:06.24 --> 00:32:10.72 Make a treat them like an adult and they kind of they're thinking they want to get treated like an adult
00:32:11.20 --> 00:32:13.52 And then when they start getting treated like adult they go
00:32:13.52 --> 00:32:16.24 Hey, I'm cool with being a kid for a little bit longer
00:32:18.88 --> 00:32:23.68 So what you doing you graduate from high school? Was it straight to the Navy? No, no
00:32:23.68 --> 00:32:26.48 I actually know intentions of joining the military
00:32:26.48 --> 00:32:31.92 So after high school I started working construction full-time and then on the weekends
00:32:31.92 --> 00:32:37.20 I worked at longs drugs on Saturdays and Sundays and this was the summer after I graduated
00:32:37.20 --> 00:32:42.16 I really didn't know what I wanted to do and then you know those two teachers are told about they're like oh, so you know
00:32:42.16 --> 00:32:46.84 You got to start college. I was like no one had ever talked to me about college and I was like
00:32:46.84 --> 00:32:49.68 I don't you know I wasn't excited about it
00:32:49.96 --> 00:32:55.84 So they signed me up for college. They helped me out and I started going to community college and I didn't like it
00:32:55.84 --> 00:32:58.76 I was there and I'm just like I feel like this is high school over again
00:32:58.76 --> 00:32:59.92 Because you know you're taking the pre-rex
00:32:59.92 --> 00:33:04.12 They're taking the same stuff so in my head I'm like I'm not learning anything right now
00:33:04.12 --> 00:33:05.48 That's gonna help me in life
00:33:05.48 --> 00:33:12.12 So I dropped out very quickly. I think I was there for like two minutes and I went back to working construction because I was making
00:33:12.12 --> 00:33:18.76 You know for an 187 actually I was still 17 because I graduated on 17. I was making good money for you know 17 18 year old
00:33:18.76 --> 00:33:23.72 Sure, and I would work seven days a week because I loved the fact that the more I worked the more money I would make
00:33:24.44 --> 00:33:27.44 So I'm like dude, no you mean I can work seven days a week so I did it
00:33:28.08 --> 00:33:31.24 And it was around that time at longs drugs. They used to have
00:33:32.36 --> 00:33:37.80 VHS you know, it's still a VHS and we rented out movies and so every Friday night
00:33:37.80 --> 00:33:41.08 I would go and pick a movie out for myself and that would be my Friday night
00:33:41.08 --> 00:33:45.16 And one day I picked up the movie Navy Seals which I really should
00:33:46.96 --> 00:33:51.16 And I went home and I watched it and I was just like whoa
00:33:51.56 --> 00:33:58.96 This is badass and then that's when I this is these are the guys that Mr. Prior talked to me about that's where I made that connection
00:33:59.68 --> 00:34:05.14 And I'm like I'm gonna go be a Navy seal and I didn't even know how to swim that well
00:34:05.14 --> 00:34:10.54 Damn yeah, I went into the recruiters office. I think the next day and you know I told him it's like hey
00:34:10.54 --> 00:34:15.26 You're sign up for the Navy won't be an Navy seal and of course. Oh, God you have stoked that recruit
00:34:15.26 --> 00:34:20.62 Oh, yeah, I was a recruiters carry out standing. Yeah, you look like you make a great Navy seal
00:34:21.70 --> 00:34:27.84 Exactly. Oh, yeah, this guy told me set me up for failure like yeah, so he you know
00:34:29.06 --> 00:34:33.18 I went through the process very quickly because I'm like hey, I'm committed. Let's do it
00:34:33.18 --> 00:34:35.18 You know
00:34:35.18 --> 00:34:37.18 And so I
00:34:37.18 --> 00:34:41.78 You know, I take the asvap whatever and then he gives me the the Corman rating. He's like we think about being a Corman
00:34:41.78 --> 00:34:44.34 I was like, well, sad. He's like oh, it's like a medic when you get out
00:34:44.34 --> 00:34:47.30 You're like a registered nurse and you can have a job. I was like, oh, okay cool
00:34:47.30 --> 00:34:52.10 So when I get out I'll have a skill so I'll be the medic on the team so I'm like, yeah, let's do it
00:34:52.90 --> 00:34:54.90 So
00:34:54.90 --> 00:34:56.90 Were you in the dot
00:34:56.90 --> 00:35:00.02 Well, you did you get some kind of a seal contract like how they didn't have that back then
00:35:00.02 --> 00:35:04.58 But here here's the thing I didn't know anything so this recruiter told me screwed me over one
00:35:04.58 --> 00:35:05.86 I wasn't a citizen
00:35:05.86 --> 00:35:10.02 So you can't be in the teams without being but you know this part of it will come into play
00:35:10.86 --> 00:35:12.86 So you know I go off to boot camp
00:35:13.82 --> 00:35:19.14 He ships me off on their corpsmen contracts. I go to boot camp. Yeah, so you're so just to everyone knows
00:35:19.42 --> 00:35:23.90 You're doing the Navy as a regular Navy dude as a corpsman and
00:35:23.90 --> 00:35:31.92 And that that gives you no leverage whatsoever to try and get to buzz. I mean very little leverage what year is this you think
00:35:31.92 --> 00:35:34.10 1999 and by the way
00:35:34.10 --> 00:35:38.38 I barely got into the Navy because I had I had felonies on my record
00:35:38.38 --> 00:35:43.54 So I had to get like multiple waivers and back then you know being the military wasn't cool
00:35:43.54 --> 00:35:47.26 So they were like all right, you know because I told my son now I'm like listen
00:35:47.26 --> 00:35:52.70 He knows I got a trouble is kid. I'm like listen. You can't do that nowadays. No, I mean you got to have secret clearances
00:35:52.70 --> 00:35:54.70 You got to do this. I mean you do now
00:35:55.38 --> 00:36:01.54 It's so their way more selective now. Oh, yeah in every branch and for seals for shirts
00:36:01.90 --> 00:36:08.94 Yeah, cuz there's so many kids that want to go into it. Yeah, they can to pick and choose exactly. Yeah, so
00:36:09.62 --> 00:36:17.02 So I go to boot camp and they have the video, you know with all the cool stuff and then I'm like this is it
00:36:17.02 --> 00:36:21.18 And then I who wants to try out and I raise my hand. I'm like heck yeah, this is it
00:36:21.18 --> 00:36:24.38 But the problem is I didn't know how to swim
00:36:26.46 --> 00:36:32.38 So we take the screener we take the screen and I and look I can get from one end of the boot of the other
00:36:32.38 --> 00:36:36.48 But I am not what you would call a good swim like I never took you know swimming classes
00:36:36.48 --> 00:36:40.68 I could do this right I kind of doggy my way over and I wasn't scared of the water
00:36:40.68 --> 00:36:45.18 I just I just wasn't good and I failed it the first time around. I was like dang dude
00:36:45.18 --> 00:36:50.02 What am I gonna do? You know now I'm really stressing because now I'm like damn I'm gonna go to the regular Navy
00:36:50.02 --> 00:36:52.02 And I was really really scared of the regular guys
00:36:52.02 --> 00:36:55.02 I don't want to get stuck on a ship and so they're like
00:36:55.90 --> 00:37:01.30 My RDC really really liked me. You know, I was her Yoman so I had I had a lot of freedom
00:37:01.30 --> 00:37:03.30 You know the Yoman cat like takes all the papers
00:37:03.30 --> 00:37:07.62 You have actually a lot of freedom in boot camp to walk around because I would deliver all the all the stuff
00:37:07.62 --> 00:37:09.62 Where'd you go to boot camp great legs?
00:37:10.10 --> 00:37:15.06 Yeah, so she was like hey, I'll let you try out one more time. I was like oh no, so I go and
00:37:15.06 --> 00:37:20.62 And by the way everyone in their mother's trying out so there's like 50 people in the pool. So I'm swimming
00:37:20.62 --> 00:37:23.58 And I'm listening to the times and I'm like oh my god
00:37:23.58 --> 00:37:25.58 I'm not gonna make it again
00:37:25.58 --> 00:37:30.38 So I just stood up at one point. I was like I'm done and they're like okay
00:37:30.38 --> 00:37:33.54 Get out and get ready for push-ups and pull-ups. I was like oh shit that worked
00:37:33.86 --> 00:37:36.70 So I got out to just cut a lot off your time
00:37:36.70 --> 00:37:38.70 I was like two or two
00:37:38.70 --> 00:37:42.58 I'm gonna say it was like at least two. I was nowhere near finishing
00:37:42.58 --> 00:37:46.74 And but there's so many kids in the pool. I'm like you any work like
00:37:46.74 --> 00:37:53.54 Had you worked out at all go so I was very athletic. Yeah, but you didn't play sports. So I played sports in high school
00:37:53.54 --> 00:38:00.38 Oh, okay, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, the coaches school. So I played you know in PE I would play football basketball anything
00:38:00.38 --> 00:38:03.78 And I would catch on to it very quickly like coaches were always hitting my mom-up
00:38:03.78 --> 00:38:08.22 Did you play any sports for the school? No, I wasn't allowed to so it's just PE yeah
00:38:08.22 --> 00:38:14.02 And that's why the coaches because the coaches are usually the PE teachers call my mom and they're like hey
00:38:14.02 --> 00:38:18.02 Like you're son really needs to play football. I really need to do that because I was really athletic
00:38:18.02 --> 00:38:24.30 I was fast and I was functionally strong because I did so many chores that I was I was a very pretty strong kid
00:38:24.30 --> 00:38:26.30 You know for my age so
00:38:26.30 --> 00:38:30.26 So I was athletic. I could do push-ups all day pull-ups all day, you know, I could run
00:38:30.26 --> 00:38:33.10 I just can swim so when I got out, you know
00:38:33.10 --> 00:38:36.98 I crushed the pull-ups and push-ups and everything else and so I'm going through the process and then
00:38:36.98 --> 00:38:40.78 The dive motivators like hey just so you know
00:38:40.78 --> 00:38:46.58 Corment or not it's not a seal rating it was the only year that they did it were for whatever reason
00:38:46.78 --> 00:38:50.86 They were like if you want to be a Corment with the teams you got to go to the Marines first
00:38:51.30 --> 00:38:58.42 So I was like, I don't want to do that so I went to the office and I changed my rating to like a boat
00:38:58.42 --> 00:39:02.50 It's made and then I go back and I'm like hey, you know
00:39:02.50 --> 00:39:07.86 I'm a seal rating now and he's like cool now and get you in and then as he's doing my paperwork he's like you're not a citizen
00:39:08.18 --> 00:39:10.18 You can't go
00:39:10.18 --> 00:39:11.38 I'm like dang it
00:39:11.38 --> 00:39:15.30 So I go back I changed it back to a Corment because I know what a boat's made is
00:39:15.62 --> 00:39:18.34 So I go back I change it back to a Corment and
00:39:19.06 --> 00:39:20.66 You know they're like hey sorry man
00:39:20.66 --> 00:39:23.94 We really liked you, but you got to get your citizenship first so
00:39:24.86 --> 00:39:28.38 From there I went to course school and then from course school
00:39:28.38 --> 00:39:32.78 Where where where do you end up with the Marines, right? Yeah, yep
00:39:32.78 --> 00:39:36.78 So about the majority of the Corment especially if you're male you're gonna go to the Marines
00:39:36.78 --> 00:39:40.62 So they sent me to school called FMSS where they basically teach you how to be a Marine
00:39:40.62 --> 00:39:42.62 You know teach you like Marine Corps
00:39:42.62 --> 00:39:48.70 Like ranks etiquette whatever and then at one point they they ask if you want to go Marine Corps regs
00:39:49.10 --> 00:39:53.18 Which is basically you got to cut your hair like them and if you do you get like to where they're they're green
00:39:53.18 --> 00:39:58.78 uniform I forget what they're called and they're and like everybody was like super moto and then yeah
00:39:58.78 --> 00:40:01.90 I want to be Marine Corps rags and then they're like what about you Mendez?
00:40:01.90 --> 00:40:03.66 You want to be Marine Corps rags? And I was like no
00:40:04.46 --> 00:40:07.74 And like but you get a uniform you get to wear the Marine Corps uniform
00:40:08.06 --> 00:40:13.34 I'm like I got enough uniforms because before you had to always carry them around in your sea bag and you had inspections all the time
00:40:13.34 --> 00:40:15.34 I'm like I don't want another uniform
00:40:16.62 --> 00:40:20.38 And it was right around that time where I met the the recon Corment that was there
00:40:20.38 --> 00:40:22.38 I
00:40:22.38 --> 00:40:27.18 Mean you just looked at him he just looked like a stud so I immediately gravitated towards him and
00:40:27.74 --> 00:40:31.90 And then he's like hey just so you know we're gonna have triodes if you want to be a recon Corment at the time
00:40:31.90 --> 00:40:37.18 They were like 40% man like we're really hurting we could really use people so I go and I try out
00:40:38.14 --> 00:40:40.14 And I feel this one again
00:40:41.18 --> 00:40:48.78 But you know he's like hey man get out do the rest of it and and that screener was actually legit like it was tough
00:40:48.78 --> 00:40:51.58 Like it was a rock run it was like pull ups push ups
00:40:51.90 --> 00:40:57.18 It was like the Marine Corps PFT and then it was like all these different calisthenics with with no number
00:40:57.74 --> 00:41:01.42 You just did it for time and they had a number that they wouldn't tell you
00:41:01.42 --> 00:41:05.42 So like hey you got to do this amount of mountain climbers and they wouldn't tell you it was like a day long
00:41:05.66 --> 00:41:11.02 Screener and I passed everything else like I crushed everything else and he was like hey I'll tell you what
00:41:11.50 --> 00:41:14.94 He's like you haven't till the end of FMSs to pass the swim
00:41:14.94 --> 00:41:19.66 He's like you're obviously you know athletic you have the physical ability to do it just can't swim
00:41:20.14 --> 00:41:26.38 So I'm like okay perfect and at one point I remember going in his office and doing like the dive physical and get my chest
00:41:26.38 --> 00:41:28.46 X-ray and whatnot somehow through conversation
00:41:28.46 --> 00:41:30.46 I was like yeah, I want to go to Buds
00:41:30.86 --> 00:41:35.90 He's like you want to do what he's like I was like I want to go to Buds eventually like I'm just kind of doing this
00:41:35.90 --> 00:41:38.94 You know my time with the Marines and until I could get the Buds and
00:41:39.50 --> 00:41:44.06 He grabs my paperwork. He like crumbles it up and he's like he will never
00:41:44.06 --> 00:41:47.82 Be a reconquerman and he chugged my stuff in the garbage
00:41:48.22 --> 00:41:53.10 He's like yeah, I'm office that was it. I was like oh, so yeah, so
00:41:54.06 --> 00:41:56.06 Then I got orders to
00:41:56.06 --> 00:42:01.66 24 I'm so grunt grunt battalion there in camp Pendleton and as soon as I get there
00:42:02.22 --> 00:42:08.46 I'm like really regretting it. I'm like dang what I do you know maybe I should have just kept my mouth shut and just gone with it
00:42:09.58 --> 00:42:12.06 And as soon as I get there, that's usually good advice
00:42:12.06 --> 00:42:15.26 Yeah, yeah, this is a my favorite. All right, and so
00:42:15.90 --> 00:42:18.70 As soon as I get to 24 they're already like hey, we're getting ready to deploy
00:42:19.10 --> 00:42:24.22 So I basically I didn't do a work of branding. I basically just I think I was home from maybe a month and then we deployed
00:42:24.78 --> 00:42:29.42 to Japan my first deployment and what are you doing or what are you doing on deployment
00:42:29.98 --> 00:42:31.74 Would you exercise this and stuff?
00:42:31.74 --> 00:42:34.86 So I was like the the coverage corpsman and and you know
00:42:35.26 --> 00:42:39.90 My chief knew that I wanted to go to Buds so he would attach me to like the amphibious assault
00:42:39.90 --> 00:42:43.74 Platoon or whatever like whether they did all the boat stuff and OTV stuff
00:42:44.30 --> 00:42:45.58 So I did that
00:42:45.58 --> 00:42:49.66 Was like their their corpsman basically if anybody got hurt. I was the corpsman coverage for that
00:42:50.14 --> 00:42:56.14 But during that deployment that's where I like got really serious about learning how to swim and I was in the pool every chance
00:42:56.14 --> 00:43:00.70 I could get like if if I had the time I would go in the mornings I would go a lunch and that's why
00:43:01.02 --> 00:43:03.82 Oh, because it was a guy that I met that dropped out of Buds and
00:43:03.82 --> 00:43:09.50 Hmm and I told him I was like do you know how to do the combat sidestroke and he's like yeah, I was like teach me
00:43:11.34 --> 00:43:15.82 So he taught me and and that's where I I got proficient at that swimming was during that deployment
00:43:17.50 --> 00:43:20.30 This is still pre 9 11. Oh, it's just all
00:43:21.02 --> 00:43:27.18 Contrary yeah, just going on training missions and big exercises and so that's a normal sex month deployment you go on with the Marines
00:43:27.18 --> 00:43:32.70 Yeah, pretty unhavenful get done with that and what happened to you come home from that so I come home and then
00:43:32.70 --> 00:43:38.62 We get a new chief and we start talking and then he's like hey, have you ever thought about going recon
00:43:40.70 --> 00:43:43.90 I was like you have thought about it, you know, but I want to go to Buds or whatever
00:43:43.90 --> 00:43:50.70 He's like hey, won't you have the conversation with this this recon chief and so the recon chief and I start talking and then he's like
00:43:51.26 --> 00:43:53.90 He's like hey, we have a guy here who's not really working out and
00:43:54.62 --> 00:44:00.70 We want to see if you want to come over here and I told him I'm like hey, I want to be honest. You like my goal is to go to Buds
00:44:00.70 --> 00:44:07.18 He's like hey listen, no problem. He's like, won't you come over here? See if you like it if you like it stay if not I'll send you to Buds
00:44:07.58 --> 00:44:09.58 And I was like okay, and then he's like
00:44:09.90 --> 00:44:11.98 He's like if you come over here, I'll give you BH
00:44:12.46 --> 00:44:14.46 Which as an email
00:44:15.10 --> 00:44:17.10 Basic allows for housing
00:44:17.10 --> 00:44:22.54 But it's legit money. No, it could be like 1200 bucks a month
00:44:22.94 --> 00:44:25.90 Yeah, and when you're what were you for you? Oh, you're an E4 you're
00:44:26.62 --> 00:44:30.14 Sorta like maybe almost doubling your paycheck not quite maybe like
00:44:30.14 --> 00:44:32.14 50% of your pay
00:44:32.46 --> 00:44:38.78 You're gonna you're gonna make extra. It's a big deal getting that BH that's why dudes get married by the way
00:44:39.18 --> 00:44:44.54 Dude, that's why you see 18-year-old Marines are like you're up and getting married. Oh, you met the woman your dreams
00:44:44.54 --> 00:44:48.38 No, but I'm gonna get be a bitch son. They want that BH
00:44:49.34 --> 00:44:53.34 Yeah, so it's a big deal especially in the Marines because in the Marines
00:44:53.34 --> 00:44:57.82 That the the barracks had to be like 95% man and you had to be like an E5 or above
00:44:57.82 --> 00:45:02.46 And so I'm an E4 and he's like BH and some magic words. I'm like let's do it
00:45:03.34 --> 00:45:09.58 So I headed over there and and I see the guy that I'm supposed to replace and the guy looks like Superman
00:45:09.98 --> 00:45:14.46 I mean he's super tall just jacked and I'm like I'm replacing this guy
00:45:15.66 --> 00:45:20.46 And then you know I kind of like I could tell that with the LPO there kind of saw I was like oh dang
00:45:20.62 --> 00:45:24.30 You know, I was like this guy and he's like his yeah, he looks like Superman, right?
00:45:24.30 --> 00:45:27.98 I was like yeah, he does he's like you know what's his kryptonite water? Oh
00:45:29.26 --> 00:45:31.58 I guess he would he would freak out during the water
00:45:31.58 --> 00:45:36.22 But because they had him like tread water with but they do a lot of stuff over there with water and and um
00:45:36.54 --> 00:45:39.10 Yeah, yes, he would just like freak out. So I'm like okay cool
00:45:40.06 --> 00:45:42.78 So that's how I ended up there. Um, they put me right into
00:45:44.62 --> 00:45:47.74 My first introduction to them was it was it was an SR
00:45:48.46 --> 00:45:50.86 So they were like hey, you're gonna do an O T B S R
00:45:50.86 --> 00:45:57.02 Yeah, penultimate yeah penultimate I just been there. I just got there and there was a cornman there who had at the
00:45:57.02 --> 00:45:59.26 Reconbite time who who had orders to go to Buds
00:46:00.06 --> 00:46:05.90 So they're they're like hey, can you take you know Carlos under your wing kind of show him how to pack out for an O T B S R
00:46:06.78 --> 00:46:11.50 And by the way, I've never swam in the ocean before so now I'm about to you know at night get dropped off
00:46:11.90 --> 00:46:17.42 Swim to the surf zone. Yeah with with the rock load out. Oh, yeah, which is no joke
00:46:17.42 --> 00:46:23.50 Normus so he's like teaching me how to like load my stuff out and then I'm like hey what about like warm weather stuff
00:46:23.82 --> 00:46:25.82 He's like this is Reconbroad
00:46:27.02 --> 00:46:32.38 And then by the way, this is winter time and and um he's like this is Reconbroad like we don't take that stuff
00:46:32.38 --> 00:46:33.74 And I'm like okay, you know
00:46:33.74 --> 00:46:38.54 Like check he's like we take batteries and this and that he's like I'm like okay got it
00:46:38.54 --> 00:46:43.26 And then I'm like hey question how am I getting this brok through the surf because of that
00:46:43.26 --> 00:46:47.90 He's like oh you can put a floatation on it. I put a ton of floatation on my cuz I'm like down on a drown
00:46:49.18 --> 00:46:50.78 So we go and we do the SR
00:46:51.34 --> 00:46:57.74 I make it through the surf zone just sheer will but I mean I must have swallowed like a gallon of water going to the
00:46:57.74 --> 00:47:00.70 Surfzone my first time ever but I you know, I'm trying not to be
00:47:01.74 --> 00:47:03.74 The weak link
00:47:03.74 --> 00:47:06.86 If you know yeah, I'm trying not to be a ffina
00:47:07.50 --> 00:47:12.62 So we make it through and you know we change out we start patrolling and then we get to to the
00:47:12.62 --> 00:47:14.62 To the place where we're gonna
00:47:14.78 --> 00:47:20.78 Set up camp and then everybody starts busing out their warmings. Yeah, they were and I look around on my
00:47:22.22 --> 00:47:25.74 Damn it and then I like hey, what's up doc like where's your stuff?
00:47:26.06 --> 00:47:27.58 I'm like where we gone
00:47:27.98 --> 00:47:34.30 I thought that we didn't bring warmings out and they like no way bro like we bring a ton of warmings out
00:47:34.86 --> 00:47:36.86 Now I'm just like oh
00:47:36.86 --> 00:47:41.02 And I'm freezing cold because it's winter time out camp in Otenham
00:47:41.02 --> 00:47:46.62 We just went through the surf so I'm still wet and finally I'm just like you know what I'm gonna volunteer to just watch the radio on night
00:47:46.94 --> 00:47:49.82 I was like there's no way I'm sleeping tonight and so I did I just
00:47:50.78 --> 00:47:56.70 Jack hammered all night long watched the radio and we'd get up and walk around just try to keep my self warm
00:47:56.86 --> 00:48:01.50 And the Marines loved it, you know, because I volunteered to do watch all night long for for the rest of this star
00:48:01.50 --> 00:48:03.50 But that was my introduction
00:48:03.90 --> 00:48:07.18 I was I when I got to the teams. I was a new guy didn't have my bird yet
00:48:07.18 --> 00:48:18.62 And I got sent to a comm school out on the east coast that was run by by the teams and I was a new guy and my butt my swim buddy was a new guy two of us and we
00:48:19.82 --> 00:48:25.54 We there was like a six day five or six day FTX that you went on at the end of this comm school
00:48:25.54 --> 00:48:28.38 It's a two month comm school's freaking legit. It was a great course and
00:48:29.34 --> 00:48:31.58 The chief that was running it
00:48:31.58 --> 00:48:38.30 You know, I was like asking him questions cuz I always want to know you know what would be a good thing to bring when we're in the field and I said
00:48:38.30 --> 00:48:40.54 Hey, you know, or guy, you know, should I bring like a sleeping bag?
00:48:40.54 --> 00:48:42.46 Should I and he goes if you're hard core will it?
00:48:42.46 --> 00:48:46.94 Because you know I was always trying to be hard core. He's like your hard core will like he was bringing a punch on a poncho liner
00:48:46.94 --> 00:48:49.74 And I was like well check. I am fucking hardcore
00:48:49.74 --> 00:48:52.94 And I'm just bringing on a poncho to a poncho liner and I did and
00:48:53.50 --> 00:48:56.38 That's what I went out and field with and as we inserted
00:48:56.38 --> 00:49:04.30 The first night it was raining as we inserted it turned to sleep like as the vehicles pulled up to drop us off and then it turned into snow
00:49:04.70 --> 00:49:07.98 It was balls called balls called and
00:49:08.74 --> 00:49:11.98 On this course you had like a comms window every
00:49:12.78 --> 00:49:16.62 Every two to four hours you'd have to make comms to some different part of the country and
00:49:17.86 --> 00:49:23.82 Most guys would like miss comm windows and that would be you're getting graded the whole time and if you had the best grade at the end
00:49:23.82 --> 00:49:25.82 Then you get extracted early and
00:49:25.82 --> 00:49:27.82 And so
00:49:27.82 --> 00:49:31.34 Me my swim buddy same thing like we were we were trying to be hardcore
00:49:31.42 --> 00:49:34.62 So we didn't have warm is for shit. We freezing and
00:49:35.74 --> 00:49:39.02 We never missed a comm window and the reason we never missed a comm window is because we couldn't
00:49:39.58 --> 00:49:41.34 It was just like freezing
00:49:41.34 --> 00:49:45.66 But yeah, that's um always bring a ground pad and always bring a bivy sack
00:49:45.66 --> 00:49:49.90 Because that's what I learned eventually the bivy sack is the deal if you got a bivy sack
00:49:49.90 --> 00:49:54.70 You can climb in there and you can pretty much just gut through some serious shit
00:49:54.70 --> 00:50:00.46 Yeah, but um yeah, that's good. That's the way that's what that's what happens to the new guys
00:50:00.54 --> 00:50:04.62 Yeah, don't believe when your chief says you we don't bring warmies
00:50:04.94 --> 00:50:09.82 These foolish shit. Yeah, well actually the the recon coming that were they they were cool about it
00:50:09.82 --> 00:50:11.90 Because they're like hey, we heard what happened like dude
00:50:12.22 --> 00:50:14.78 I'm not gonna say the guy's name. He's like he totally hooked you up
00:50:15.42 --> 00:50:17.42 All right, yeah, he did
00:50:18.30 --> 00:50:22.94 So at that point they put me into rip which is the recon doctoration puttons
00:50:22.94 --> 00:50:26.62 So basically it's you competing for a slot at their at BRC
00:50:27.02 --> 00:50:32.54 Which is like their selection process and that's a bonus is it still in corn out of it's in camp Hamilton
00:50:32.54 --> 00:50:37.74 Okay, so rip is in camp Hamilton. What's the one I used there used to be something corn that's BRC God so in rip
00:50:38.22 --> 00:50:42.30 They put everybody in there who just showed up to the talent and you're come because there's only 30 slots
00:50:42.30 --> 00:50:43.66 So you're competing
00:50:43.66 --> 00:50:50.70 So the top 30 guys go to BRC if you didn't make that cut you go through rip again and hopefully you make it through the you know
00:50:50.70 --> 00:50:55.90 You're in top 30 now long as rip so it did there's no like real timeline to it
00:50:55.90 --> 00:50:58.46 I think it was just like hey, you're just doing it until the next class
00:50:59.02 --> 00:51:03.34 The BRC shows up and then they start ranking you and then you get your your slot
00:51:04.14 --> 00:51:08.06 And so you know the common one like hey just you know like you know Marines are always harder on the
00:51:08.06 --> 00:51:14.78 Corbin don't let us down and so I go to rip and I'm doing well on everything except for land now
00:51:14.78 --> 00:51:20.30 I can't freaking land now to save my life dude. I was just getting lost and I was really getting down on myself and
00:51:20.86 --> 00:51:24.46 And then one day I just clicked like I looked at the map and I'm just like
00:51:25.18 --> 00:51:31.18 It came to life. I get it. Yeah. I don't know it was just like this moment like a light bulb moment and from that point on like I was like land
00:51:31.18 --> 00:51:32.38 I've got it
00:51:32.38 --> 00:51:35.34 So I was able to secure a spot to BRC
00:51:36.38 --> 00:51:41.14 So I go to BRC which is in corn out of and that's what I start seeing like the blood's guys and I'm like
00:51:41.14 --> 00:51:47.54 Dang you know which I was here, but I'm here now and you know I did pretty well and BRC
00:51:47.86 --> 00:51:55.14 There was a guy there named Mendoza and he was not good at all and the instructors would get us confused
00:51:55.70 --> 00:51:58.58 And so I would be running by and like hey you drop
00:51:58.98 --> 00:52:03.94 That was like okay and like wish I heard you lost your map and this and that and I was like that was in me
00:52:03.94 --> 00:52:05.94 That was Mendoza and they're like oh
00:52:05.94 --> 00:52:12.42 Like we'll push him out anyways, you know and then finally this guy I don't remember if he quit or if he got dropped
00:52:12.42 --> 00:52:14.98 But thank goodness because then once he got dropped
00:52:14.98 --> 00:52:18.10 I'm just like cool because he was just messing up left and right and they would get us confused
00:52:18.66 --> 00:52:21.62 Mendoza so I had to pay the man a few times for his
00:52:22.34 --> 00:52:24.10 And then sometimes they're like you know what both of you
00:52:25.14 --> 00:52:26.90 Just pay the man how long is BRC?
00:52:27.94 --> 00:52:30.98 If I remember correctly back then I think it was like two months long
00:52:30.98 --> 00:52:39.38 And so you obviously you finished it. I did not I actually got a stress fracture about two weeks from graduating and
00:52:40.18 --> 00:52:46.74 You know they they sent me back to the to the BAS with the corpsman. I got to X-ray and everything like yeah
00:52:46.98 --> 00:52:52.98 And at the time you know there's they were like hey how was he doing and like actually he's he ranked number one in the class before he got dropped
00:52:52.98 --> 00:52:54.98 So he's like he's welcome to come back and
00:52:54.98 --> 00:53:00.90 And then at that point that I hate you want to go back and I said no as I got want to go to Buds
00:53:01.94 --> 00:53:06.66 I made my decision that was like here. I want to do this like because here's the thing like if you finish
00:53:08.42 --> 00:53:13.62 Now you owe them time because after that they sent us to you finish then you sent you to jump school
00:53:13.62 --> 00:53:16.66 Diive school and now you belong to them because they've invested money into you
00:53:17.86 --> 00:53:20.98 And it was kind of funny too because when I went they were like
00:53:20.98 --> 00:53:28.98 Somehow it came up that I wasn't a citizen and they were like oh shit. You're not a citizen like you actually weren't supposed to go to BRC if you weren't
00:53:28.98 --> 00:53:34.90 So they were like let's get you some citizenship so they they kind of fast track me and I was able to get my citizenship
00:53:35.38 --> 00:53:38.90 And so they're like hey for the rest of the time here, you know, we're just gonna attach you to a platoon
00:53:39.86 --> 00:53:43.94 And so they improved you going about they were like all right, that's what you wanted to do. Yeah, they were really yeah
00:53:43.94 --> 00:53:49.14 They were awesome about it. They got great leadership there. They were great great like super professional guys
00:53:49.14 --> 00:53:51.14 I still keep in touch with some of them
00:53:51.54 --> 00:53:54.42 So hey, it's all you what we're gonna do till you get orders and you go
00:53:54.42 --> 00:53:58.58 We're just gonna put you an uplatoon and you're gonna do work up deployment and you just be the corpsman
00:53:58.58 --> 00:54:02.50 And then when you get your orders to go to buds you go so
00:54:03.54 --> 00:54:08.18 That's what I did until I got orders to go to buns. What are you worried about this stress fractures scenario?
00:54:08.50 --> 00:54:11.58 Because like that's all kinds of people get stress fractures but I
00:54:12.58 --> 00:54:15.58 Wasn't because I I never you know
00:54:15.58 --> 00:54:22.14 I was like oh, I'll heal up on me young no factor. Yeah, so I got orders to go to buds in
00:54:23.58 --> 00:54:25.58 November of 2003
00:54:25.58 --> 00:54:31.58 Right or 2002 sorry 2002 November of 2002 so where were you when when 9-11 happened?
00:54:31.58 --> 00:54:39.34 I was at the for reconbetian, but they were like hey, I don't think we got deployed or anybody from that battalion got deployed
00:54:40.22 --> 00:54:42.22 Um
00:54:42.22 --> 00:54:45.42 To have can't stand at that time, but I that was still there
00:54:45.66 --> 00:54:50.14 But you know at that time already had my path so they're like hey even if you go there
00:54:50.14 --> 00:54:53.68 You're not gonna go with the football town so then when do you when do you get the buds finally?
00:54:54.22 --> 00:54:56.22 November of 2002
00:54:57.34 --> 00:54:59.34 What you expected
00:54:59.34 --> 00:55:06.14 I was you must have been pretty freaking kind of ready for it. Oh, oh, yeah, I had I had run with a rock
00:55:06.14 --> 00:55:10.06 I'd done OTV's countless OTV's. I was really good at land-out
00:55:10.06 --> 00:55:15.26 I mean like I got attached to a platoon did a workup to point with them so I was I was ready
00:55:16.22 --> 00:55:17.02 Um
00:55:17.02 --> 00:55:21.34 And so when I showed it like oh here's the thing to they they sent me to like a
00:55:22.06 --> 00:55:24.46 Like a combat engine here in battalion
00:55:24.46 --> 00:55:28.22 They're like hey, we're gonna send you they can't be in the platoon anymore because they're about to deploy and
00:55:28.94 --> 00:55:33.82 You know obviously it's gonna overlap you're gonna start buds before when I'm gonna bring you home halfway through deployment
00:55:33.82 --> 00:55:39.18 So they're like go to this combat engineer in battalion and you can work out all day and that's where I met this guy named Captain Gwen
00:55:40.86 --> 00:55:45.98 Who had like a master's degree in can easyology and was all about in the fitness and when he learned that I was going to buds
00:55:45.98 --> 00:55:47.98 He's like let me train you
00:55:47.98 --> 00:55:55.58 I was like your series. He's like yeah, so he got me even more prepared like we worked out three times a day in the morning at lunch and afterwards
00:55:55.82 --> 00:56:00.30 And then he started teaching me how to eat properly. So when I got to buds I was
00:56:00.30 --> 00:56:07.18 I was ready like I could do 30 more pull ups 120 push up 120 set like I was I was a machine when I got there
00:56:08.22 --> 00:56:15.26 And your water had obviously improved. Oh, yeah, yeah, I have at that point I'd done countless OTVs and yeah, that was good to go
00:56:16.22 --> 00:56:19.82 And then did you get what you expected there in buds any any issues or anything
00:56:21.02 --> 00:56:23.98 So when I got there, I'm like, you know everybody tells you oh you got to be the gray man
00:56:23.98 --> 00:56:25.98 So I'm like okay cool. I'm gonna be the gray man
00:56:25.98 --> 00:56:33.34 But if I gray man people that don't know this is just a term to to explain if you can go to buds and you can kind of
00:56:33.98 --> 00:56:36.78 Not stand out that's a good thing because
00:56:37.74 --> 00:56:44.06 There's very few people that stand there's only might be one or two maybe three people in a class that stand out because they're good
00:56:44.94 --> 00:56:48.94 But the people that stand out because they're bad and then once you got someone watching you
00:56:49.34 --> 00:56:53.42 Yeah, then every you're they're gonna start seeing all kinds of things that you're doing that are jacked up so
00:56:53.42 --> 00:56:55.42 one of the
00:56:55.58 --> 00:57:02.54 Strategies of going to buds is to try to be the quote gray man meaning just be in the middle
00:57:03.18 --> 00:57:06.62 Finish the stuff don't stand out don't draw any attention to yourself and
00:57:07.18 --> 00:57:11.50 That's a good strategy for getting through and you would hurt. I don't think we had that
00:57:11.50 --> 00:57:13.50 I don't think that was a term when I went through
00:57:14.14 --> 00:57:16.54 But I kind of instinctively well
00:57:16.54 --> 00:57:23.90 Everyone instinctively knew you didn't want the freedom instructors to know your name or your face or you just wanted them to ignore you as much
00:57:23.90 --> 00:57:27.18 Sponsibal so you know you just try to do what you're told and try and you know
00:57:27.18 --> 00:57:30.54 Yeah, try not to stand out and that was the plan. I'm like all right
00:57:30.54 --> 00:57:33.50 I'm not gonna shine you know I'm just gonna stay like the top 25%
00:57:34.62 --> 00:57:37.58 But that was not possible because
00:57:38.38 --> 00:57:42.86 When I first got to buds you know you're standing watch when you're waiting to class up and
00:57:42.86 --> 00:57:47.26 You know a buddy of mine there and buzz like hey, let's go out one night
00:57:47.58 --> 00:57:51.98 You know, let's be before we go out so we go out we party and how old are you?
00:57:53.02 --> 00:57:59.42 22 yeah 2002. I'm 22. I was like I was young so I couldn't know what's going out. Wasn't the thing
00:57:59.42 --> 00:58:03.42 I could go into the the bar the the E club on base you could drink when you're 18
00:58:03.82 --> 00:58:07.50 But I wouldn't even want to do that. I was just trying to make it through buds. So it's weird to me
00:58:07.98 --> 00:58:12.14 It would've been it's weird to me like having a guy like hey, let's go out to a bar
00:58:12.14 --> 00:58:15.66 Because I can't fathom what it would be like to go to a bar when I was in Buds yeah
00:58:15.98 --> 00:58:18.78 So we go out and he starts talking to this girl
00:58:19.42 --> 00:58:24.86 And then he's like hey, bro like I need you to you know, our friend really likes you like I need you to
00:58:25.34 --> 00:58:28.94 To entertain her while I'm with this girl and blah, blah, blah, I'm like do you not got a girlfriend?
00:58:29.02 --> 00:58:31.98 He's like come on man. We're gonna be in the teams like you're supposed to have my back
00:58:32.38 --> 00:58:36.62 You know what if you don't want to be known as that guy and I'm like really like you're gonna play that card with me
00:58:36.62 --> 00:58:43.34 So I'm like dude. I'm not dead. You know, I'll talk to her. I'll keep her busy free, but I could tell she's enemy like she wants
00:58:44.46 --> 00:58:48.14 She she wants more and he's like dude. We're gonna go back to their place
00:58:48.70 --> 00:58:53.66 And I'm like dude. I really don't want to he's like bro come on. You gotta do this for me
00:58:53.66 --> 00:58:56.86 I'm like listen, I think she wants more than what I'm willing to give
00:58:57.66 --> 00:59:01.34 Because one I wasn't attracted or two, you know, I had a girlfriend at the time and then um
00:59:02.06 --> 00:59:05.42 So I'm like all right dude like I'll go I'll go back to their house with you and
00:59:05.42 --> 00:59:11.26 When we get there I see her car and it has a first recomb Italian sticker on it
00:59:11.82 --> 00:59:12.86 Oh
00:59:12.86 --> 00:59:18.70 And I recognize that sticker because it's a sticker for different parking lots. You had different stickers and that was like an operator sticker
00:59:18.70 --> 00:59:21.02 Like if you got the parking the operator parking lot
00:59:22.14 --> 00:59:24.14 And so I was like hey where'd you get that sticker from
00:59:25.18 --> 00:59:29.02 She's like oh yeah, I could tell she's getting flushed and she's like my husband
00:59:30.22 --> 00:59:32.22 In my head
00:59:32.22 --> 00:59:37.42 Just like yotsie. This is my out and I'm like bro we can not do this we gotta go
00:59:37.90 --> 00:59:42.54 I was like I am not doing it now I have a legit reason to not go through with this
00:59:43.26 --> 00:59:45.74 So we take off we go back to buds and
00:59:46.78 --> 00:59:50.78 Now I'm standing watch on on Monday morning and I get a phone call
00:59:51.02 --> 00:59:55.74 I'm I'm standing watch at the quarter deck with another guy and I get a phone call from the
00:59:55.98 --> 01:00:01.58 618 quarter deck so 618 is where the barracks are at so you have the buds quarter deck and you have the the barracks quarter deck
01:00:01.58 --> 01:00:05.18 And it's it's one of the guys in my class and he's like hey, loasters

01:01:07.82 --> 01:01:13.34 So I'm sitting there and then another guy that I'm with he's like bro you have to tell the instructor

01:01:19.50 --> 01:01:22.22 And the OD happens to be a first phase instructor that day
01:01:22.22 --> 01:01:27.82 Yeah, so I'm just like oh my goodness so I'm like all right
01:01:28.54 --> 01:01:30.86 So I go to the first phase office, you know, I ring the bell

01:01:42.14 --> 01:01:46.06 So I go in there and at that time all the instructor to buds were like enormous
01:01:46.06 --> 01:01:52.70 They're all like six to enough just jacked out of their minds like I'm just swear they do it on purpose for intimidation factor
01:01:52.70 --> 01:01:54.70 But at the time they were all enormous
01:01:55.02 --> 01:02:00.70 So I go in there and they're like dropped her so I'm in the push-up position and my dress blues, you know, and then like what do you want?
01:02:00.94 --> 01:02:03.58 I'm just like marines coming over to kick my ass
01:02:04.86 --> 01:02:07.58 And they're like you just screw his old lady or something
01:02:07.58 --> 01:02:14.94 I was like nobody thinks I did and they're like like who's this marine coming over here starts some shit like let's go there beat his ass
01:02:14.94 --> 01:02:20.46 So the entire first phase staff's like yeah, let's go over there. So they all head over there to the quarter-deck
01:02:20.46 --> 01:02:26.78 And at the time there's like some guys from like team five that were waiting there to to screen for another team and
01:02:27.18 --> 01:02:29.66 Some of them knew each other so like, you know what's up with up?

01:02:41.98 --> 01:02:47.02 And then the phone rings and my buddy from 618 he's like hey, bro
01:02:47.02 --> 01:02:48.86 I heard what happened. I was totally messing with you
01:02:50.78 --> 01:02:53.78 And I could literally my
01:02:55.50 --> 01:03:01.66 The blood just like drained from my face and then the instructor's like is it him?
01:03:02.70 --> 01:03:10.38 And I was just like I just I I didn't I couldn't speak so I just handed him the phone and then he's like

01:03:16.30 --> 01:03:20.30 He's like it was a joke. He's like oh you got jokes
01:03:21.10 --> 01:03:27.18 I got jokes too. He's like you and Mendez in your wetsuits two canteens on the grind
01:03:27.82 --> 01:03:29.82 Good song. Oh yeah
01:03:30.94 --> 01:03:32.94 We got beat
01:03:33.50 --> 01:03:35.50 He ended up quitting shortly thereafter
01:03:35.50 --> 01:03:37.50 Um
01:03:37.74 --> 01:03:39.74 But there was no being the gray man
01:03:39.74 --> 01:03:46.38 The only way you were the man. Oh, yeah, and it was just like from that point on I would be like where's Mendez does a matter hit the sir
01:03:47.26 --> 01:03:49.42 All you pasture uniform detection that's great
01:03:49.66 --> 01:03:54.72 It's surfing so yeah, so I was like all right. Well if I'm not gonna be the gray man just go balls out. I guess
01:03:54.72 --> 01:03:56.72 I was well freaking legit
01:03:58.38 --> 01:04:01.02 So you're not the gray man anymore and
01:04:02.38 --> 01:04:04.38 You're going just going hard
01:04:04.38 --> 01:04:08.46 Is there was any she having issues in boats? Yeah, I did
01:04:10.06 --> 01:04:15.78 No, no, it's fun. Finds issues man. Yeah fine jeries. Yeah, you know during one of the surf passage
01:04:16.86 --> 01:04:23.30 Evolutions I had one of the paddles come across and like break across my shin and so I had this huge bruise on my shin for a while and I was like you know
01:04:23.30 --> 01:04:28.46 Whatever and I just kept going through training and at one point I realized that
01:04:28.46 --> 01:04:35.66 When I would press down on my muscle it would just stay and my knee got really swollen. I could barely move it and I'm a
01:04:35.66 --> 01:04:38.66 Corment so I know I'm like do these are like
01:04:39.98 --> 01:04:45.18 Symptoms with compartments syndrome but I didn't want to say anything so I made it to the weekend
01:04:45.18 --> 01:04:50.70 And I went back up to the to the recon battalion and I'm like hey guys like is this what I think it is?
01:04:50.70 --> 01:04:52.70 And I like I think it is like do you need to go to the hospital?
01:04:52.70 --> 01:04:56.06 So I was like well, I don't want to go to butks and I want to get dropped or rolled or whatever
01:04:56.06 --> 01:05:00.30 So I check myself into camp penalty in hospital and then they're like
01:05:00.86 --> 01:05:05.02 Dude you got to get this drain you either have to have surgery. You have to get this drained and I was like
01:05:05.58 --> 01:05:10.54 Well, can we try draining it first and they're like yeah sure so they got this enormous needle
01:05:10.54 --> 01:05:14.62 I mean it was thick too and they just started like draining the blood from there and they're like
01:05:15.38 --> 01:05:19.74 Did you're not gonna be able to finish buds and whatever I was like no I'll be fine
01:05:19.74 --> 01:05:27.98 So I go back to buds and then the instructors got word that I had checked into to medical up there in the light dude
01:05:27.98 --> 01:05:29.50 We have a medical here
01:05:29.50 --> 01:05:33.82 They're cool about it like I thought they were gonna be pissed but they were like hey, you know
01:05:34.46 --> 01:05:36.46 They they liked me at that point
01:05:36.86 --> 01:05:41.10 One phase was that first phase. Oh, this is before hell week. Dang them yeah before hell
01:05:41.10 --> 01:05:45.18 So it was like the week before hell week and then they were like hey no big deal
01:05:45.18 --> 01:05:47.18 We're just roll you to the next class
01:05:47.18 --> 01:05:50.70 And I was like you know as it was extremely disappointing
01:05:51.50 --> 01:05:56.86 So I got rolled and then I got rolled into two four five and then
01:05:57.42 --> 01:05:59.02 though run
01:05:59.02 --> 01:06:04.70 Before like the the last day before we started hell week on a run I stepped in a paw hole
01:06:05.34 --> 01:06:08.54 Or I stepped in like you know holding the sand and I twisted my ankle
01:06:09.26 --> 01:06:13.42 Really bad like that scene was enormously swollen and then
01:06:13.42 --> 01:06:17.18 I was like no, it's fine like I'll go through hell week and you know I'll be fine
01:06:17.58 --> 01:06:21.18 And they're like, dude you're not gonna be able to go through that and in my head I'm like this is twice now
01:06:21.58 --> 01:06:23.58 There's no way they're keeping me and
01:06:24.46 --> 01:06:26.46 The the proctor at the time
01:06:27.18 --> 01:06:29.18 You know he's looking through my record. He's like
01:06:30.30 --> 01:06:36.78 Dude you haven't failed a single evolution here like not a uniform inspection not a room inspection
01:06:37.58 --> 01:06:41.18 And you know how they are over there. He's like not one I was like no
01:06:41.18 --> 01:06:45.02 So you know I had attention detail from a my childhood
01:06:45.74 --> 01:06:50.22 And be you know my time with the Marines like I had attention to detail and I could follow directions
01:06:50.22 --> 01:06:54.86 I was like that was the one thing I could really do so they're like you know you haven't failed anything at all
01:06:54.86 --> 01:06:57.58 They're like you know what we're gonna roll you one last time
01:06:58.62 --> 01:07:02.22 And then you know last time I made it all the way through no issues so
01:07:03.66 --> 01:07:05.66 And then where'd you end up going from there?
01:07:05.66 --> 01:07:10.46 So you know you got jump school ask you tea
01:07:11.74 --> 01:07:16.46 Alaska and then I was a corpsman so they sent me to
01:07:17.34 --> 01:07:19.34 18 delta to
01:07:19.34 --> 01:07:21.98 To go through the special operations medic course
01:07:22.70 --> 01:07:27.34 Which is freaking long too. Yeah, it's a little over six months and if you go through the full course
01:07:27.34 --> 01:07:28.54 It's like a year long
01:07:28.70 --> 01:07:32.06 Did you go through the short course or the long course? Yeah, so I went through the short course
01:07:32.06 --> 01:07:34.06 They asked me if I wanted to do the long course
01:07:34.06 --> 01:07:36.38 And I said no I didn't want to do that
01:07:37.50 --> 01:07:44.78 But before I headed out there you know I'd been dating the girl else telling about but and we actually ended up getting married before I went out there
01:07:45.98 --> 01:07:50.22 And I did it because when I was going so I had just bought a house to
01:07:50.86 --> 01:07:55.10 So I bought a house around that time in San Diego. We're not in San Diego isn't to make you look so many of you
01:07:55.66 --> 01:07:59.42 You know and I was like oh look at this big ass house like a biotic a for cheap
01:07:59.90 --> 01:08:03.34 You know back then it was you know that there and I didn't realize like how long that drive was
01:08:03.34 --> 01:08:05.34 So
01:08:05.18 --> 01:08:11.26 So I got married because I'm like hey, I really need the San Diego BH because I spoke to the admin lady at Buds and she's like yeah
01:08:11.26 --> 01:08:16.50 You have a house in your marion and you have your hair you're gonna get San Diego BH and not North Carolina BH
01:08:16.50 --> 01:08:18.50 Which is like
01:08:18.50 --> 01:08:22.72 It's penny compared to San Diego so once again. Why did you get married want that be a
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000 I did love her. I'm sure there's other
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:34.52 But yeah, so the reason I bring that up is because that was actually a sticking point when I was there
01:08:34.52 --> 01:08:39.88 It was an issue because as I was going to the training I wasn't getting paid at all I was getting
01:08:40.32 --> 01:08:42.48 Zero like you know money knows no behavior
01:08:42.48 --> 01:08:49.32 Yeah, which is a big deal because now I got a mortgage and so I'm digging into my savings and I've been going you know, you know to the
01:08:50.32 --> 01:08:53.36 To the cadre that were there. They have some seal cadre there's well
01:08:53.36 --> 01:08:56.56 It's not like all army guys obviously they have the liaison's for friend of W
01:08:56.56 --> 01:08:58.56 And
01:08:58.56 --> 01:09:01.66 I you know I kept going up to them and tell them like yeah, I still haven't got paid
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.76 Still haven't got paid and they're just like, oh don't worry about it and like it'll happen like they just I just feel like they weren't concerned about it at all
01:09:09.32 --> 01:09:13.78 And for being honest I wasn't a fan of theirs like I could just just didn't get a good feeling from them and
01:09:15.52 --> 01:09:21.68 I'm really digging into my savings and now I'm running out of money and I don't know if you know Captain Smithers is
01:09:21.68 --> 01:09:27.56 So he was the CO at Buds when we were there and obviously like they knew who I was because
01:09:27.84 --> 01:09:32.48 What happened so you know him and I had chatted every now and then and he actually came out and did some jumps with us
01:09:32.48 --> 01:09:36.08 And at what point during one of the jumps like you was sitting next to me
01:09:36.36 --> 01:09:39.52 He was like hey, you know just so you know if you ever need anything reach out
01:09:41.40 --> 01:09:43.40 You see where this is going
01:09:43.40 --> 01:09:53.20 So I call Buds quarter deck and I'm like, you know Buds quarter deck and I'm like you can please transfer me to catch some others off of that
01:09:51.92 --> 01:09:55.78 So I told him the story I'm like hey, I haven't got paid like these guys have totally blown me off
01:09:55.78 --> 01:09:58.20 They haven't been helpful at all blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and he's pissed
01:09:58.20 --> 01:10:05.12 He's like check so he has commander Zinky call me and commander Zinky calls me and then he's like that's that's unsat
01:10:05.56 --> 01:10:09.56 That you've gone that long without getting paid so he calls over to the school
01:10:09.56 --> 01:10:15.56 I get paid like two weeks later, but I get brought in and just shoot out by this senior chief and chief that are over there
01:10:15.56 --> 01:10:19.12 And they're like you know, do you not understand how the chain of command works?
01:10:19.12 --> 01:10:21.88 blah, I mean they were furious and they're like you know
01:10:21.88 --> 01:10:26.28 We're gonna take you to a trident review board. We're gonna drive you down to Virginia Beach
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.28 And have a trident review board. I'm like these guys serious
01:10:31.64 --> 01:10:36.80 So I go back home and I start calling like my recomb ladies. I'm like hey, is it cool if I come back?
01:10:36.80 --> 01:10:42.32 I think they're gonna pull my trident and then they're like dude heck yeah, if you if you get dropped come on back
01:10:43.64 --> 01:10:46.000 So you know I go in there and then
01:10:46.72 --> 01:10:48.72 During one of the
01:10:48.72 --> 01:10:53.20 The ass chewings that I'm getting I'm like you know what I'm like if you guys really take me to a trident review board
01:10:53.20 --> 01:10:54.70 This is like what would you know?
01:10:54.70 --> 01:11:00.44 We're consumed your cold camps. Me there's no like we're friends now again if you take me to try and review board I'll call them again
01:11:01.44 --> 01:11:04.48 And they were like now they're like lost their mind
01:11:04.48 --> 01:11:08.64 And then they're like you'll be hearing from us when it's time for your trident review board
01:11:08.64 --> 01:11:14.68 And I just never heard from them. They left it alone and I got paid like two weeks later
01:11:16.12 --> 01:11:17.76 They
01:11:19.76 --> 01:11:22.12 Anything else from 18 delta?
01:11:22.76 --> 01:11:28.06 Well, I was where I met Neil. I met Johnny Kim. Oh right on that little genius
01:11:28.72 --> 01:11:30.52 Yeah, so he was in the class behind me
01:11:30.52 --> 01:11:36.72 I met Johnny Kim. I was also roommates with a with the dober all right on he was my roommate
01:11:37.52 --> 01:11:40.24 And Delta so it's pretty cool going through with him
01:11:41.88 --> 01:11:46.62 Yeah, and then you those guys ended up coming to team three and you ended up coming to go in a team one
01:11:46.62 --> 01:11:51.22 Yeah, so I actually was initially supposed to go to team three and
01:11:51.72 --> 01:11:56.82 Then the corn in that went to team one for I for whatever reason he couldn't get a security clearance
01:11:56.82 --> 01:12:02.90 So they're like hey, you're gonna go to team one now who's already started their work up and then you know
01:12:02.90 --> 01:12:05.54 Dober was the first one to get orders to team three
01:12:07.38 --> 01:12:10.22 So yeah, that's how I showed up team one. I think
01:12:11.58 --> 01:12:14.02 2005 are you just fully amped to be
01:12:14.58 --> 01:12:17.34 Yeah, just like beyond and the war's going on
01:12:17.98 --> 01:12:19.98 On deployment
01:12:19.98 --> 01:12:24.42 Yeah, you get thrown right into a platoon. Yeah, so I get thrown into the platoon
01:12:24.42 --> 01:12:28.10 We start they've they've already started their work up
01:12:29.22 --> 01:12:35.06 And it was everything that I was gonna be it was awesome the best job ever
01:12:35.06 --> 01:12:38.34 I mean it really was I mean we would go to you know
01:12:38.94 --> 01:12:44.14 Mississippi for training and do seek you see and then we would go to Kentucky for South and then we
01:12:44.66 --> 01:12:48.10 You know around that time the PSD mission was gone so here we got to driving schools
01:12:48.42 --> 01:12:51.46 So we would go to driving schools and it was just awesome like I
01:12:51.46 --> 01:12:58.78 Loved being around the guys like it was it was everything I thought it would be it was it was pretty cool
01:12:59.78 --> 01:13:02.98 We had some it's a mission in the platoon though
01:13:04.78 --> 01:13:06.78 We went through three different chiefs
01:13:07.06 --> 01:13:15.22 Dang yeah, so the leadership was a little bit of a dang of a problem and then I think the last chiefs that they brought in there
01:13:15.22 --> 01:13:20.94 Like I don't think he was really into it. He was just like yeah, I'll do it, you know, oh
01:13:21.78 --> 01:13:26.10 The crazy thing one of the crazy things I learned to trade at when I was working at trade at was
01:13:27.30 --> 01:13:30.54 Look you're gonna you're gonna have some weak chiefs you're gonna have some weak officers
01:13:30.54 --> 01:13:37.38 But if you have some good dudes in there, yeah, you'll just overcome all that you just overcome all of it and you'll fit you guys are the guys are gonna figure out
01:13:39.46 --> 01:13:41.46 Often times the seal teams succeeds
01:13:41.46 --> 01:13:48.50 Becuse of the lower because because of the leadership from somewhere in the platoon doesn't have to come from the OIC
01:13:48.50 --> 01:13:51.46 It doesn't have to come from the chief now those guys can be bad enough that they actually
01:13:52.10 --> 01:13:56.58 squash the junior leadership and that's when you have a platoon that just falls apart completely
01:13:56.94 --> 01:14:04.58 But if the you know, I've seen OICs that were just completely getting carried by some two e-fives in the platoon
01:14:04.58 --> 01:14:07.94 The OIC and the chief getting carried by two or three good e-fives
01:14:07.94 --> 01:14:09.94 I've seen that all day long. I'm sure you did too
01:14:09.94 --> 01:14:14.66 Yeah, but occasionally you'll get a chief for a OIC that
01:14:15.14 --> 01:14:17.14 Look when they're great. That's great. We're all good
01:14:17.22 --> 01:14:22.84 But it's occasionally they'll squash the junior leadership because their ego gets involved and then I want the you know
01:14:22.84 --> 01:14:26.34 Someone else making calls and it just turns into a total disaster
01:14:27.62 --> 01:14:29.62 The OIC wasn't very well acting
01:14:32.42 --> 01:14:37.70 So you guys are getting do you guys know where you're going on the plymet? No because we're competing for four
01:14:37.70 --> 01:14:40.58 We're going at the time and you know
01:14:41.30 --> 01:14:45.22 I guess that unfortunately the leadership didn't build good relationships up the chain of command
01:14:45.22 --> 01:14:52.98 So even though the platoon was awesome like we had some really talented people in that platoon really talented people in that platoon and
01:14:54.98 --> 01:14:59.86 You know it is what it is that it just did build really we were not the favorite platoon and
01:15:00.66 --> 01:15:04.18 It was around that time when there you know the OIC came up to me. It's like hey, you know
01:15:04.18 --> 01:15:09.06 We're short snipers do you know you were a Marine you're gonna land that Bob odd you want to go
01:15:09.46 --> 01:15:12.74 Do you want to go to sniper school and I said yeah
01:15:14.82 --> 01:15:22.62 He's like two caveats he's like one it's Army sniper school and two you got to go to UAV school afterwards and I'm like yeah
01:15:22.62 --> 01:15:28.22 Yeah, fine whatever just send me yeah, it's so weird how your mentality could be so
01:15:28.22 --> 01:15:34.38 Unaligned with other people they're giving you these quote caveats. Yeah, bro when when we ended up going to Ramadi
01:15:34.38 --> 01:15:37.58 We were supposed to go to Baghdad and task into bruiser and my
01:15:38.46 --> 01:15:44.18 Commanding officer calls me in and he's like he's presenting this thing to me like it's the worst deal ever
01:15:44.18 --> 01:15:50.46 And I'm like so happy. I'm trying I'm just poker face, you know like hey Roger that scrum should we can make some adjustments
01:15:50.46 --> 01:15:53.50 And then I was like oh I can negotiate and I said well we're gonna need this
01:15:53.50 --> 01:15:58.94 I'm gonna need some more people and some more like support and he was like yeah, we can take care of that totally hooked me up, bro
01:15:58.94 --> 01:16:02.30 But I was like oh, are you serious you can send us to Ramadi instead?
01:16:02.98 --> 01:16:06.90 Let's do this yeah, he was thrown caveat at me. I'm like yep
01:16:06.90 --> 01:16:10.54 No, I'm really sorry. We're gonna send you to you. We're gonna send you to you. I'm like
01:16:11.10 --> 01:16:12.82 Okay, you know I'm trying to hold my side
01:16:12.82 --> 01:16:17.66 Yeah, yeah, let's do it. So yeah, so I ended up going to army sniper school and that was
01:16:18.14 --> 01:16:21.34 That was cool going to army school and you know
01:16:21.34 --> 01:16:25.22 It's pretty funny dealing with the army guy. So I had one point so they sent another guy with me
01:16:25.22 --> 01:16:30.54 So they sent two of us to sniper school and we go out to a bar one night and we see some of the guys from our class
01:16:30.54 --> 01:16:35.02 And at that you know at that point they were kind of standoffish because we were being quiet too
01:16:35.02 --> 01:16:41.66 You know, we didn't really talk to people. They see us at the bar and they're like hey you guys are you guys are the seals in our class, right?
01:16:41.66 --> 01:16:45.10 And we're like yeah, you guys is my wife by your shot
01:16:45.58 --> 01:16:46.94 I was like yeah, let's do it
01:16:46.94 --> 01:16:49.90 So I'm like cool. So they buy us a shot and I
01:16:49.90 --> 01:16:55.98 Take this shot and it's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted in my life like I want to throw up
01:16:56.86 --> 01:17:00.62 And it's it's funny because I so I take the shot and they're like looking at us
01:17:01.42 --> 01:17:05.26 And I want thanks guys even though inside I'm like what the hell was this?
01:17:05.26 --> 01:17:08.62 So I said it down on my thanks fellas and they're like looking at like
01:17:09.10 --> 01:17:11.10 Dang that's why they're maybe
01:17:12.22 --> 01:17:17.42 So I guess they gave us like some gag shot that's both to like make you throw up
01:17:17.42 --> 01:17:24.14 Yeah, and both of us were just like normal face all the time. Yeah, no expression like thanks fellas, but inside I'm like what
01:17:26.62 --> 01:17:28.62 It was disgusting and then here just like
01:17:29.18 --> 01:17:32.62 Dang that's why the baby's you just you see that they didn't even flinch
01:17:33.10 --> 01:17:35.74 Anyway flinch and then
01:17:36.78 --> 01:17:38.78 Yeah, and then we had another
01:17:38.78 --> 01:17:40.78 We were back in
01:17:40.78 --> 01:17:45.66 Back in and training and they were like oh you guys didn't load up in the truck fast enough for something like that
01:17:45.66 --> 01:17:49.90 And they're like oh this one guy was like freaking out like guys if we don't do this fast enough we're gonna get beat
01:17:50.30 --> 01:17:52.70 I'm like so what if we get beat like
01:17:52.94 --> 01:17:55.42 Okay, and one of the instructors heard me
01:17:55.66 --> 01:17:59.10 But he didn't know who I was so he was just like oh we got we got a tough guy the group
01:17:59.42 --> 01:18:02.14 He's like all right he's like come on out
01:18:02.54 --> 01:18:05.90 So he's like push-ups, you know, I'm doing push-ups. I don't push-ups and then he's like
01:18:06.38 --> 01:18:09.10 Okay, flutter kicks and by the way like I
01:18:09.34 --> 01:18:13.98 Used to do so many flutter kicks that I got tired accounting and I would literally set my timer for 10 minutes straight
01:18:13.98 --> 01:18:16.94 And we just do flutter kicks for 10 minutes straight because I didn't want a count anymore
01:18:17.18 --> 01:18:22.38 So he's having me do these flutter kicks and I could tell one of the other instructors like giggling behind it
01:18:22.54 --> 01:18:24.54 Because the guy doesn't know why I mean like oh
01:18:25.18 --> 01:18:29.10 Kind of good at these and then the instructor's like bro, you know, he's a seal right?
01:18:29.10 --> 01:18:30.38 He's like
01:18:30.38 --> 01:18:35.10 Dude, why didn't you tell me I'm over here like an idiot trying to break this guy. He's not gonna break
01:18:35.66 --> 01:18:37.66 And then afterwards like he's like you want you want a dip
01:18:38.94 --> 01:18:40.86 I'm just like no, I don't dip, but thank you
01:18:40.86 --> 01:18:46.62 Yeah, so you end up going on a point and you go to go to a visit yeah pay calm to point
01:18:47.50 --> 01:18:49.26 That's where you guys went right yeah, so
01:18:50.30 --> 01:18:54.06 The majority of the platoon got sent to go on and then they were like hey if you're a
01:18:54.30 --> 01:18:59.58 Uav pilot a sniper or a corpsman you're gonna go to the PI and I was all three three for three three for three
01:18:59.58 --> 01:19:02.78 So that deployment was kind of weird for me because I wasn't with
01:19:03.58 --> 01:19:07.98 My platoon for the majority of time like I was literally getting formed out to whoever needed me
01:19:07.98 --> 01:19:14.22 So I went to Tau-Tau-A, Holy Oze and belong to those times where I got attached to like an ODA unit
01:19:14.62 --> 01:19:16.62 Because they didn't have their 18 delta with them and
01:19:17.26 --> 01:19:23.42 You know, I got attached to them and and there was a point there on the deployment where I got
01:19:25.10 --> 01:19:26.62 I got sent home a ship
01:19:26.62 --> 01:19:30.72 You know because that's how that I was getting transported for one place to another and at the time I had another
01:19:30.72 --> 01:19:36.46 Oh, I see the way you said that you're like I got sent on a ship. Yeah. Well, that was like the one thing that I dreaded
01:19:36.46 --> 01:19:42.62 You know as going on a ship. So this was like my first ship experience and I'm there with my my jail who
01:19:43.26 --> 01:19:46.06 As a prior force recon gunny
01:19:46.62 --> 01:19:51.10 You probably know who he is very tall dude. Yeah, it looks mean. Just tatted up
01:19:51.98 --> 01:19:56.14 And so we're on this ship together and we we go to Chau and
01:19:56.70 --> 01:20:00.70 I was like hey, sir, you know, this is where you and I part ways I got to go eat with the enlisted
01:20:00.70 --> 01:20:04.38 You got to go to officers. He's like I'm not eating by myself. He's like you're coming with me
01:20:04.38 --> 01:20:10.54 And we're wearing sterile camis so no name tapes no rank nothing so we go into the Chauhall with the officers and
01:20:11.82 --> 01:20:16.46 So I'm sitting there and and you can tell like there's this this surface war for officer
01:20:16.46 --> 01:20:22.46 He's looking at us because he sees he's might my jail. I mean he's tatted up. Yeah, no, we both don't look like officers
01:20:24.86 --> 01:20:28.46 So he's he's looking at some finally gets he gets the courage come sit next
01:20:28.46 --> 01:20:33.82 He's like so uh who are you guys and then he's like oh I'm lieutenant so and so and this is Lieutenant Mendez
01:20:33.82 --> 01:20:37.90 I was like oh dang. I just got promoted for five to Lieutenant
01:20:38.70 --> 01:20:42.94 So for like the rest of the deployment or sorry the the rest of the time on the ship
01:20:42.94 --> 01:20:45.66 He's like calling me sir and whatnot and at one point
01:20:46.30 --> 01:20:50.22 You know I'm getting off the heel with my sniper rifle because we're doing like some sniper stuff
01:20:50.94 --> 01:20:55.10 I'm getting off the heel with my sniper rifle and the CEO knows who we are we're on his ship
01:20:55.34 --> 01:20:58.94 And he was standing XCO and the CEO's like hey, HM2, do you might have all that?
01:20:58.94 --> 01:21:04.46 Can you mind if I check out your your sniper rifle and you just see this guy's look he's just
01:21:05.26 --> 01:21:09.34 She's steaming inside that he'd been calling me sir for like two weeks
01:21:10.46 --> 01:21:12.70 He's like turns out I'm an HM2
01:21:12.70 --> 01:21:14.70 HM2 man
01:21:14.70 --> 01:21:19.02 Spot promoted that's like Andy Stomp spot promotes himself to whatever rank is required
01:21:22.78 --> 01:21:27.26 And then you come back from that just roll into another petoon. Yeah, and how's that one girl?
01:21:27.26 --> 01:21:29.26 It was awesome
01:21:29.98 --> 01:21:34.30 I had a new OIC new chief new LPO
01:21:35.90 --> 01:21:37.90 And
01:21:37.90 --> 01:21:43.90 This OIC was was pretty awesome. He I remember when he first got there he set a meeting with me
01:21:44.46 --> 01:21:47.66 And I'm thinking oh man, I'm in trouble like what's you know because up to that point
01:21:47.66 --> 01:21:51.02 I had very little interaction with my I OIC very minimal
01:21:51.02 --> 01:21:57.10 And I'm thinking dude I'm in trouble so I go in there and it kind of shocked me that he asked me like hey
01:21:57.10 --> 01:22:00.46 So what you know what your family situation like like how are you doing?
01:22:00.78 --> 01:22:02.14 Is there anything you need?
01:22:02.14 --> 01:22:04.14 Where do you want to go with your career?
01:22:04.14 --> 01:22:06.54 I was like the first time anybody had really asked me
01:22:06.94 --> 01:22:09.58 I was like I don't know I'll just have him a great time being in a platoon
01:22:10.62 --> 01:22:14.54 You know and he's like you know I noticed you don't have a college degree there's this program
01:22:15.10 --> 01:22:18.62 Where you can get commission we send you away to school for three years and you come back as an officer
01:22:18.62 --> 01:22:20.22 Is that something you'd be interested in?
01:22:20.22 --> 01:22:24.38 I was like I'll actually you know I actually had never heard of that but yeah, it's interesting
01:22:24.38 --> 01:22:29.98 I'll keep it in mind and you know I always say that this guy built a better relationship in the first two weeks with us
01:22:30.30 --> 01:22:33.10 Then the prior OIC had built like in two years
01:22:34.46 --> 01:22:38.70 So it's pretty cool he we tactically speaking he probably wasn't the best
01:22:40.78 --> 01:22:46.78 But strategically he was he was great because he knew who his subject matter expert were he was a very humble guy
01:22:46.78 --> 01:22:55.34 Leaned on them a lot and you know the same group was was together again and it was an awesome awesome workup
01:22:55.58 --> 01:23:00.62 For me like I had a even better time in the first time because I'll be honest like I was I was disappointed the first time around
01:23:00.94 --> 01:23:06.62 With leadership because I had been exposed to really good leadership with the Marines right I mean they were like
01:23:07.26 --> 01:23:10.38 Just absolute professionals and then when I got to that first
01:23:11.82 --> 01:23:14.38 Platoon you know it's a little disappointed so I'm like okay cool
01:23:14.38 --> 01:23:17.82 So that's when I started realizing like okay leadership is you know
01:23:18.14 --> 01:23:21.74 Ebson flows sometimes you get good ones sometimes you get bad ones and anything in between
01:23:22.30 --> 01:23:26.54 The Velcro just like anything else when you go through was that when I was running trade it when you're going through that workup
01:23:26.54 --> 01:23:33.74 I don't think you are there. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think you were there yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know one thing I've always said is the
01:23:34.86 --> 01:23:40.54 The Marines have like a tighter shot group or like a tighter standard so
01:23:40.54 --> 01:23:46.86 Like if you have like the best you know the best seal between they're going to be freaking off the charts awesome
01:23:46.86 --> 01:23:51.10 Yeah, and but the worst seal puttune is going to be off the charts shitty
01:23:51.90 --> 01:23:56.78 And the Marine Corps has like a tighter more standardized group of like hey, this is what this is where they're going to be
01:23:56.78 --> 01:23:57.98 They're going to fit in their better
01:23:57.98 --> 01:24:01.02 Which is nice because you don't end up with those low points of leadership
01:24:02.46 --> 01:24:04.46 And then we're doing up going on
01:24:05.02 --> 01:24:07.02 On deployment so
01:24:07.02 --> 01:24:09.90 Um, so before deployment actually they sent me to
01:24:10.46 --> 01:24:15.42 To Central America for a while because they had they had us, you know a mission going down down there adjacent
01:24:15.82 --> 01:24:18.38 Type mission they're like hey, does anybody speak fluent Spanish?
01:24:19.02 --> 01:24:23.26 I was like I speak fluent Spanish so they sent me down there and so I was there for
01:24:24.14 --> 01:24:25.34 For a while
01:24:25.34 --> 01:24:30.86 I'll say it was long because they switched other people out like so they were there's like other guys would be go there for two weeks
01:24:30.86 --> 01:24:35.58 or so, but I was there the entire time just because I was teaching all the classes and going out with them and stuff
01:24:35.58 --> 01:24:37.58 So I did that first and then
01:24:38.70 --> 01:24:40.70 We ended up getting
01:24:40.70 --> 01:24:41.74 Remoddy
01:24:41.74 --> 01:24:46.78 So like okay cool we're going back to we're going to Remoddy for a deployment and so I'm like finally
01:24:47.66 --> 01:24:50.70 This is it and when did you show up there?
01:24:51.90 --> 01:24:53.90 October
01:24:54.78 --> 01:24:56.78 Let's see my son was born
01:24:56.78 --> 01:24:57.98 July
01:24:57.98 --> 01:25:03.26 So yeah September october timeframe okay, so I was home for like a couple months after my son was born
01:25:03.26 --> 01:25:09.10 But it hit me a little doubt a lot by that time oh yeah a lot a lot yeah, yeah, yeah, so what was the deployment like
01:25:10.14 --> 01:25:13.42 So it started off fantastic like when we got there
01:25:14.78 --> 01:25:17.90 We hadn't been in country that long and I remember we got our first mission and
01:25:18.94 --> 01:25:20.62 And
01:25:20.62 --> 01:25:24.62 It was pretty cool because they're like hey, it's it's a little bit outside of Remoddy so we guys are going to take helo's there
01:25:25.58 --> 01:25:30.14 So I'm the point man, you know I'm planning out the routes and stuff and I remember getting in the helo and
01:25:30.14 --> 01:25:35.66 And looking around being like whoa, this is legit. Well, this is finally here like I've got my you know
01:25:35.66 --> 01:25:38.94 I look around everybody's got their their nods on. We've got their weapons wearing the helo
01:25:40.22 --> 01:25:43.50 And you know, it was a DA mission like
01:25:44.46 --> 01:25:50.86 It's basically everything that you want to do and so you know we get dropped off a few clicks away
01:25:51.26 --> 01:25:53.26 Patrol into the target and
01:25:54.46 --> 01:25:58.06 I see some guards out there with with AKs and and it's the first time like
01:25:58.06 --> 01:26:03.34 Like like literally first mission and I get to shoot someone right off the back. No, like this is awesome
01:26:05.34 --> 01:26:09.10 So I'm thinking that that's the way things are you know because I go back to the base and I'm like
01:26:09.10 --> 01:26:10.70 I got you know, I got to reload my mags
01:26:11.74 --> 01:26:16.78 So I'm thinking this is going to be like a normal thing. I better go get some more ammo because you know if it's going to be like this all the
01:26:16.78 --> 01:26:18.78 Plymouth and
01:26:19.02 --> 01:26:21.42 And then we actually don't do anything for like a month
01:26:21.98 --> 01:26:23.98 I'm just like a
01:26:23.98 --> 01:26:25.98 We suck again
01:26:25.98 --> 01:26:30.06 But then they're like hey listen there's there's work to be done but if you want to do it you got to go to the outskirts
01:26:31.34 --> 01:26:36.70 So we actually ended up packing all our homies and going out to Tharthar and then from from there
01:26:36.70 --> 01:26:40.70 We were at some small base and we're like living out of our homies, but but we were working
01:26:40.86 --> 01:26:42.86 Which is what team guys want to do so it was true
01:26:43.34 --> 01:26:46.62 I thought it was as great a plymet you know when I hear you talk about your your first one
01:26:47.50 --> 01:26:51.34 That's kind of how I see this one you're doing DAs all the time. You know no one really got hurt
01:26:51.74 --> 01:26:53.90 You know it was great so
01:26:53.90 --> 01:26:55.90 And you get some good
01:26:56.14 --> 01:26:58.78 Experts good to do those reps, man. Oh yeah, like you just
01:26:59.58 --> 01:27:05.50 The whole cycle from the planning to the to the transit to the execution things aren't going quite right
01:27:05.50 --> 01:27:12.70 But you get them sorted out like you just get good reps, man. Yeah. Yeah. Yep, and as a point man like it was it was a really good experience for me
01:27:13.26 --> 01:27:15.26 As funny cuz like around that time
01:27:16.06 --> 01:27:17.02 You know
01:27:17.02 --> 01:27:21.50 My my OIC at one point we something changed in the plan and then he's like hey
01:27:21.50 --> 01:27:27.98 We need to switch course or whatever. I'm like check. I was like let me get in my poncho and my red red lens
01:27:28.62 --> 01:27:31.50 He's like what are you doing? Oh, like I need to look at my map
01:27:31.90 --> 01:27:36.78 He's like how have you been navigating this whole time? I was like map and compass because in the Marines
01:27:36.78 --> 01:27:37.98 That's how we did it
01:27:38.22 --> 01:27:40.62 He's like you don't have a GPS and I'm like no
01:27:41.18 --> 01:27:43.18 He's like if you're gonna be my point man
01:27:43.58 --> 01:27:45.58 You need to know how to use a GPS
01:27:46.30 --> 01:27:50.54 Because I'm like you know under my poncho my red lens like looking at my map and trying to figure it all out and then
01:27:50.54 --> 01:27:52.54 And so I go back to camp and I'm
01:27:53.26 --> 01:27:59.98 I bust out my GPS. It's still in the wrapper. Damn. It's still in the wrapper. So I'm reading the directions and when I
01:28:01.74 --> 01:28:03.74 I'm reading the directions to this thing and
01:28:04.62 --> 01:28:07.90 Then I'm like where is this thing been my whole life? Yeah
01:28:08.78 --> 01:28:10.78 This is awesome
01:28:10.78 --> 01:28:16.62 Damn that's crazy that was in 2007. Yeah, yeah, I don't know what's happening about the compass yeah
01:28:16.62 --> 01:28:23.98 Because that's the way I had always done it in the Marines. We did eight on a land map and that's actually how I became the point man because one of the more experienced guys was like
01:28:24.38 --> 01:28:26.38 Hey, bro, I don't know how to land have
01:28:26.38 --> 01:28:29.50 He's like you know I land and this was like my first first up
01:28:30.06 --> 01:28:31.02 Button
01:28:31.02 --> 01:28:33.98 He's like hey, you're really good at land. That right you see with the Marines. Oh my god, pretty good
01:28:33.98 --> 01:28:35.98 He's like won't be the point man. I was like heck yeah
01:28:36.30 --> 01:28:40.62 So I'd be came point man, but no one knew that I was just going off my campus my compass and mountain
01:28:40.62 --> 01:28:47.42 And they'll then and then when I discovered that GPS man game changer yeah, especially by that time because by that time in 2007
01:28:47.42 --> 01:28:50.06 It was like one of the you'd have when you're wrist yeah
01:28:50.06 --> 01:28:52.38 When you're wrist so that's what I had I had the little Garmin one
01:28:52.38 --> 01:28:55.58 I mean it even goes on your wrist. I'm like this is amazing freaking ridiculous
01:28:55.58 --> 01:28:58.46 And then I started carrying two of them around like one in here and one of my pocket
01:28:58.46 --> 01:28:59.74 Just in case that one protect now
01:28:59.74 --> 01:29:04.70 I really liked it so I'm like I don't want this thing breaking down on hey what up that story with the S vest
01:29:06.06 --> 01:29:09.18 So there's a couple actually so the one
01:29:09.18 --> 01:29:14.70 Um, then you know, we always talk about the complacency we had there was like a drone
01:29:15.50 --> 01:29:17.50 That had
01:29:17.50 --> 01:29:21.66 Watch some guys like planning some IDs in the road and then followed them back to their house and
01:29:22.22 --> 01:29:27.26 They're like hey guys are gonna go hit this house like cool so our opportunity was tasked with hitting that house
01:29:28.06 --> 01:29:30.86 And when our you know my pretend gets there they're like oh
01:29:31.42 --> 01:29:33.34 It was kind of odd because there's just like an old man
01:29:33.34 --> 01:29:38.78 Some women and children like it's kind of odd and you know as we're on target or whatever
01:29:39.82 --> 01:29:41.98 We start finding some like propaganda
01:29:42.14 --> 01:29:45.50 We start finding like some small stuff but nothing huge
01:29:46.54 --> 01:29:48.78 And we'd been on target for I'm gonna say
01:29:49.42 --> 01:29:51.42 At least like three four hours
01:29:51.74 --> 01:29:55.34 So we were there for a while like we got pictures and guys like sitting on a couch and
01:29:55.90 --> 01:29:58.54 And by the way, it's like a painful story to tell afterwards because you know
01:29:58.54 --> 01:30:03.42 And you like to think that your professionals and it's definitely a slap in the face like whoa
01:30:03.42 --> 01:30:07.98 It's really not over because it's leading up this like how many opposite you run at this point
01:30:07.98 --> 01:30:12.38 We'd been there for a while so you so you were kind of we were in a good rhythm you were getting the reps
01:30:12.38 --> 01:30:16.14 But the reps start becoming routine. Yep, and we were in the outskirts too. So like
01:30:16.78 --> 01:30:24.06 This this house was out in the middle of nowhere. It's not like in Ramadi where it's like a very dynamic environment where everybody starts coming out and they know you're there
01:30:24.94 --> 01:30:25.94 Um
01:30:25.94 --> 01:30:31.22 So anyways, so we're doing SSC in one of our guys. So wait, so you hit this target. It's in the middle of vehicles
01:30:31.38 --> 01:30:36.30 Yeah, yeah, so you drive vehicles up you hit the target now you've done this a bunch of times
01:30:36.50 --> 01:30:38.50 You get the target cleared
01:30:38.50 --> 01:30:46.54 No contact when you hit the target the people that you find on target is sort of the typical sort of people that you're gonna find
01:30:46.82 --> 01:30:49.30 Old man couple women some kids
01:30:49.74 --> 01:30:53.62 The house is looks like all the other houses look like so
01:30:53.62 --> 01:30:59.42 In your mind you're probably thinking this is probably probably probably nothing here. Yeah, absolutely
01:30:59.42 --> 01:31:02.90 And we had to add targets like that as well and you're there for three hours doing SSC
01:31:02.90 --> 01:31:07.42 Yeah, because we started finding stuff so like guys actually had their helmet and they were like picks and shovels and stuff
01:31:07.42 --> 01:31:10.10 Okay, like we're actually like breaking down some walls
01:31:10.10 --> 01:31:16.14 We found some false walls and stuff and okay, so suspects so as your search and you're like, oh, this is some propaganda
01:31:16.14 --> 01:31:22.58 We need to go a little harder. Yeah, now we go a little bit harder. We find more stuff. Yep, and so but at the same time there's been no
01:31:22.58 --> 01:31:23.58 No
01:31:23.58 --> 01:31:30.90 No bad guys, no, so you're just really just doing an Intel recovery at this point. Yeah, yeah, which means you're guys kind of chill
01:31:30.90 --> 01:31:32.90 No, very much
01:31:32.90 --> 01:31:34.90 Countess yeah
01:31:35.90 --> 01:31:42.06 I actually have a picture of that, but so anyway, so one of our guys goes into one of the rooms and lifts a rug up and there's this
01:31:43.18 --> 01:31:48.62 There's something on the floor that that's a little different color than the rest and you could tell it's kind of like a door or something
01:31:48.62 --> 01:31:54.76 So he calls the EOD guy. Oh, so hey come check this out. You know make sure it's not booby trapped and he's like, no, we're good
01:31:54.76 --> 01:31:56.26 And I think we're good. Let's open enough
01:31:56.38 --> 01:32:02.80 So we open it up and there's there's a bunch of dudes down there. I think it was like 13 to 15 dudes down there and the first couple have like suicide vessel
01:32:04.18 --> 01:32:07.80 guy Chuck's a grenade up it hits our EOD guy in the chest
01:32:08.30 --> 01:32:12.10 They dive like behind some furniture the the grenade went low order
01:32:12.98 --> 01:32:14.34 so
01:32:14.34 --> 01:32:20.38 You want to talk about someone looking out for you that it was old, you know, so it didn't blow up to its full potential and
01:32:20.82 --> 01:32:29.06 The avalanche call came out because they saw the S vessel on the dude so avalanche everybody runs out of the house and as the last dude runs out
01:32:29.86 --> 01:32:31.86 You know our hombees are already
01:32:32.10 --> 01:32:38.98 Ready to go and as soon as the last dude last man out it was like 50 cows like boobo boobo and we don't know if like a 50 cow
01:32:38.98 --> 01:32:43.66 Hit someone's vest or if the dude clocked himself off, but the house blew up
01:32:43.66 --> 01:32:45.66 The house blew up and
01:32:46.66 --> 01:32:52.02 Some of the guys were we're still alive. I guess that we're still under even that even after that explosion
01:32:52.90 --> 01:32:57.88 So guys are coming up some guys left their helmets and nods inside the house
01:32:58.54 --> 01:33:02.20 So some guys got no nons. I think a couple weapons were left in there as well
01:33:04.30 --> 01:33:11.86 Yeah, as a matter of fact I'll tell you that some of the stuff we recovered afterwards, but anyways, so yeah, we're laying down fire and
01:33:11.86 --> 01:33:17.82 And at one point a rocket is shot and it hits like five feet from our humby
01:33:17.86 --> 01:33:21.14 So we're like hey, we need to back out and we need to drop air on this thing
01:33:21.54 --> 01:33:26.26 So we'd back out we drop air on it and actually drop the couple bombs on it and then
01:33:26.66 --> 01:33:31.50 You know afterwards when we go and recover stuff you could tell that these these guys that that were there they weren't
01:33:32.14 --> 01:33:37.50 They were there were foreign fighters. They were different than some of the other guys that we had come across
01:33:37.50 --> 01:33:42.14 But we recovered some of the nods that we left in there. We recovered
01:33:42.86 --> 01:33:50.42 One of the weapons that we had left in there and it's crazy because I guess one of them must have picked the weapon up like our
01:33:50.42 --> 01:33:57.54 Rm4 and started shooting with that m4 and when we picked up that m4 at the front of the barrel
01:33:57.54 --> 01:34:01.72 You can tell that the 50 cow round had gone through the front of the barrel
01:34:01.72 --> 01:34:06.54 Pay you out the back blew this guys head off and then we found this guys head like 50 yards down
01:34:06.54 --> 01:34:12.76 Down the road, but I was crazy. So I mean, you know, we have a picture of the gun like with a 50 cow
01:34:13.42 --> 01:34:17.46 So doing that report on all the lost stuff
01:34:18.26 --> 01:34:25.46 That's things were you the LPO of this put to oh no no, I'll just say just the door kicker. Yeah. Oh, that's right
01:34:25.46 --> 01:34:28.06 You said you were the point man. Yeah, I love being a point man
01:34:30.30 --> 01:34:34.84 So that gets your that that snaps you back into reality. Yep. Yep
01:34:34.84 --> 01:34:36.84 So
01:34:37.40 --> 01:34:38.68 Yeah
01:34:38.68 --> 01:34:41.54 It's completely you said there was a couple S best stories
01:34:42.36 --> 01:34:45.08 Yeah, so the other one was I guess they were
01:34:45.92 --> 01:34:50.64 They were smuggling some S best in I forget from where it was you know when you're young
01:34:50.64 --> 01:34:56.70 You don't pay attention to some of the details that are passed on but they were they were importing some S best
01:34:57.32 --> 01:35:04.48 And at one point that the Iraqi police pulled this guy over who they thought could be one of those guys that was smuggling S best
01:35:04.48 --> 01:35:09.66 So we take the vehicle and we we rip it apart completely and behind the glow compartment
01:35:09.66 --> 01:35:14.72 We find an S best and so our UD guys take it out and then they're like hey
01:35:15.44 --> 01:35:20.64 Let's make it a nerd and let's put it back and let's see where he goes and then we'll catch him and his friend
01:35:21.36 --> 01:35:25.84 So they do that they make you know, they they make the the best and we put it back
01:35:25.84 --> 01:35:30.40 We give the car back to the Iraqi police at that point. You don't know who's you know who's who?
01:35:30.40 --> 01:35:34.48 They're all corrupt, you know, there's people that had infiltrated
01:35:35.04 --> 01:35:39.52 All forms of government police so we didn't tell him what we found or just like hey, we're good
01:35:39.92 --> 01:35:43.32 So they're like okay cool. So they let the guy go and of course he goes back to his house
01:35:43.32 --> 01:35:48.60 And at this point now we're being mandated to bring you know the Iraqis with us because for a while
01:35:48.60 --> 01:35:50.84 There are from where I could remember we were by ourselves
01:35:51.32 --> 01:35:56.16 Like just us but this point like okay, so anyway, so we end up hitting this house and
01:35:56.16 --> 01:36:01.04 Well boy has his best on and he's like trying to clock himself off all but it's inert
01:36:01.44 --> 01:36:05.44 That's all and he had actually two switches like he had a primary in a secondary
01:36:05.44 --> 01:36:09.56 So you know he's yelling out you know like boy and he's like click and he's like oh crap and he's a click
01:36:09.56 --> 01:36:11.56 Trying to do the other one and
01:36:11.56 --> 01:36:13.56 How's that working out for you homey?
01:36:13.56 --> 01:36:15.56 He's got no head
01:36:16.20 --> 01:36:20.000 It's stuff man and no one got hurt on that freaking though where the
01:36:20.88 --> 01:36:23.20 Spider-Hole was huh? No damn
01:36:23.20 --> 01:36:27.40 It's like I said that's about it's good to play as you could do a lot of work and no one got hurt
01:36:29.20 --> 01:36:31.60 You get done with that and then is that when you come to trade it?
01:36:32.20 --> 01:36:37.84 Yeah, so I come back and they're like hey, you're gonna have to go trade it and I'm like I don't want to go to trade it
01:36:37.84 --> 01:36:41.84 You know are you and he's six now? I'm in he's six. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
01:36:41.84 --> 01:36:43.84 I just made he's six on that and women actually
01:36:44.56 --> 01:36:46.32 so
01:36:46.32 --> 01:36:50.12 You know I come back home. I'm I'm having some personal issues
01:36:50.12 --> 01:36:54.12 You know with with my wife at the time and
01:36:55.60 --> 01:37:00.54 You know and instead of trying to work things out and be a good husband
01:37:00.88 --> 01:37:06.50 Which you know I look back on I could have done a much much better job of you know
01:37:06.50 --> 01:37:11.28 I look back at that marriage. I'm like hey, you know that's 100% my fault. I wasn't a very empathetic person
01:37:13.08 --> 01:37:16.16 Marriage is tough thing and it's even tougher when you're young and you know
01:37:16.16 --> 01:37:21.08 It's even tougher when you married a team guy who's gone all the time and I didn't think about that
01:37:21.08 --> 01:37:24.000 You know, I'm just like you know she moved right from a parent house to me
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.40 And I'm just like I don't understand what you're complaining about
01:37:26.68 --> 01:37:30.76 Anyways, there's a lot of tension between her and she served me divorce papers and
01:37:32.72 --> 01:37:36.72 Instead of you know trying to take a knee and work things out. What do I do?
01:37:36.96 --> 01:37:41.84 They're like hey, oh there's corn and needed for this. I've got a stand-to-plyment and I'm like I'll go
01:37:41.84 --> 01:37:48.24 So I end up volunteering for for a very short augment
01:37:49.24 --> 01:37:52.56 Before I go to trade it and then you would add him want to go to trade it so they were like hey
01:37:52.56 --> 01:37:57.04 You've got some time here a team one before you check into trade it cool that was kind of like
01:37:57.76 --> 01:38:05.56 You know my give me so there I cool go do that and so I come back from that deployment and then that's when I I check in the trade it and
01:38:06.48 --> 01:38:08.48 That's why I meet JP Denil
01:38:08.48 --> 01:38:10.48 And
01:38:11.28 --> 01:38:13.28 Did you go straight into
01:38:13.84 --> 01:38:15.84 Straight into south straight into CQC?
01:38:16.08 --> 01:38:22.80 Yeah, so back then the the the senior enlisted of the assault cell he would like interview guys
01:38:23.20 --> 01:38:27.36 To go to assaults because he was like hey if you're gonna come to assaults like we're screening
01:38:27.36 --> 01:38:31.06 And so I remember him coming up talked to me while I was still a team one
01:38:31.06 --> 01:38:33.76 I just got back from deployment so like yeah, you're going you're going to assaults
01:38:34.32 --> 01:38:36.32 So I ended up going to south
01:38:36.32 --> 01:38:38.32 But you know
01:38:39.44 --> 01:38:47.84 Being the team guy I was like I can go to CQC to like yeah, sure you know, yeah, so I was doing CQC trips south trips and it was it was pretty cool and
01:38:48.84 --> 01:38:54.14 You were there. That's when you were there and then JP was the OPO at the time. Yep. Yep. Yeah
01:38:54.68 --> 01:38:57.68 What did you learn in sitting there teaching?
01:38:59.60 --> 01:39:04.52 You know, so now looking back I always told people that trade it was actually the biggest
01:39:04.52 --> 01:39:10.12 Learning experience that I ever had because it's like the ultimate leadership lab
01:39:10.76 --> 01:39:17.88 Because you get to watch two different styles of leadership go through and you're you're to completely detach
01:39:17.88 --> 01:39:20.84 You have zero emotion and invested into that whatsoever
01:39:20.84 --> 01:39:23.48 So you can armchair quarterback that stuff all day long
01:39:25.80 --> 01:39:27.16 And
01:39:27.16 --> 01:39:32.12 It was where you know, I started realizing the the difference in leadership
01:39:32.12 --> 01:39:35.52 Hmm because if you think about it the talent is for the most part
01:39:35.52 --> 01:39:39.02 Is it right out pretty evenly? You're gonna have some good some good guys
01:39:39.02 --> 01:39:40.68 You can have a handful of new guys. You're gonna have some
01:39:41.32 --> 01:39:48.000 E5 pipe hitters you're gonna have some couple slugs like the boys are gonna be pretty consistent
01:39:48.32 --> 01:39:53.40 Most of the time yep. You're gonna get that so yeah, it all it all boils down to just how was the leadership?
01:39:53.40 --> 01:39:55.40 How good is the leadership and if leadership good?
01:39:55.40 --> 01:39:57.24 Between's gonna rock and if the leadership sucks
01:39:57.24 --> 01:40:02.72 We could have some problems yep, so that's when I started seeing that you know
01:40:04.28 --> 01:40:06.52 Yeah, training is the same and I was like, okay
01:40:06.52 --> 01:40:12.20 It really depends on that leadership how they're gonna do and it was really cool to see like the leadership that did well
01:40:13.32 --> 01:40:18.08 It was simply because they were humble like you could just tell their attitude right off the bat
01:40:18.08 --> 01:40:21.48 Like they're like you know when you give them you know criticism or critiques or whatever
01:40:21.48 --> 01:40:24.64 They're like got it got it whereas the platoons that did terrible
01:40:24.64 --> 01:40:31.48 They were just like you could just tell they had attitudes about hearing anything that any feedback that you had to give them and it was very
01:40:31.60 --> 01:40:37.68 Blame like the difference between the the platoons that had humble leadership and the platoons that just did not
01:40:38.48 --> 01:40:45.64 I would like take this to the end degree in my own head because I always wanted to make sure that
01:40:47.08 --> 01:40:51.76 Hey, what am I doing am I doing a good job of getting through this individual leader, right?
01:40:51.76 --> 01:40:56.98 And if it seems like this leader like maybe they have a big ego and they think they're a badass
01:40:57.44 --> 01:41:02.24 You know, I don't care I always wanted to make sure that it wasn't me that it wasn't my end
01:41:02.24 --> 01:41:04.72 I was like okay, you know what the guy's got a big ego. That's okay
01:41:04.72 --> 01:41:11.52 We want guys with big ego. So like you got to have a big ego. Let me rephrase that there's nothing you can't expect seals to not have
01:41:12.12 --> 01:41:15.84 Some kind of ego like hey, I know how to do this some level of confidence, right?
01:41:15.84 --> 01:41:19.40 You like so it's okay. I get it. You know you you think you're badass cool
01:41:19.40 --> 01:41:24.56 I don't want to work for someone that doesn't think they're a badass right cool. I'm good with it. Okay. Let's move forward that
01:41:26.08 --> 01:41:28.08 But man
01:41:28.08 --> 01:41:33.88 You'd get these guys that occasionally again most most of the most of the leaders are like cool
01:41:33.88 --> 01:41:38.92 That weren't we're down a cage. Now remember I remember once I we had this one leader coming through south
01:41:38.92 --> 01:41:39.92 and
01:41:39.92 --> 01:41:41.92 I talked to our
01:41:41.92 --> 01:41:46.28 civilian that worked there who is a prior you know seal he was actually my
01:41:46.28 --> 01:41:50.68 My TUSCA when I was doing commander and I said hey, bro man
01:41:50.68 --> 01:41:56.64 Just can you do me favor just check me on this like just look at this guy's face when I'm putting out word and just give me
01:41:56.64 --> 01:41:58.64 I go cuz it seems to me
01:41:58.80 --> 01:42:00.80 Like it doesn't want to hear anything from anybody
01:42:00.80 --> 01:42:06.88 I just want to make sure I'm not totally off base, but can you just check him out and so sure enough like as I
01:42:07.24 --> 01:42:11.72 As I'm talking you look I've used that with his arms crossed and and and I get I'm just saying
01:42:11.72 --> 01:42:15.72 I'm not even like saying do you're totally jacked up? I'm not saying anything like that
01:42:15.72 --> 01:42:23.42 I'd say something like hey man, do you ever think about maybe you know putting some vehicles over here on this target and you can see the guys like arms
01:42:23.42 --> 01:42:26.22 Car I'm not I'm just offering the suggestion
01:42:26.22 --> 01:42:32.20 You know and they do arm costs and yeah, we get done with that debrief and that civilian comes up to me
01:42:32.20 --> 01:42:37.64 And he's like bro this guy's freaking crazy and I said okay. I just wanted to make sure because it just
01:42:39.40 --> 01:42:43.06 I guess the reason I'm saying this is because like I's intrigued at
01:42:43.06 --> 01:42:45.06 That
01:42:45.06 --> 01:42:50.28 The guys in trade at the attitude of our guys in trade at was just to try and help out our friends that are in the team
01:42:50.28 --> 01:42:54.42 It's like that arena of puttune that that was the attitude the attitude. There's no like hey
01:42:54.42 --> 01:42:56.90 I know how to do this you don't there was no
01:42:57.62 --> 01:43:00.10 Matter of fact I wouldn't allow that kind of shit if we had instructors like that
01:43:00.10 --> 01:43:04.38 I would freaking pull them aside because our instructors realize like oh
01:43:04.50 --> 01:43:08.90 Where these guys are our friends there are teammates they're getting ready to deploy
01:43:08.90 --> 01:43:14.58 We did do our best to help them out yeah, and and a lot of those guys know as much as what we know
01:43:14.90 --> 01:43:18.46 Right, so you got a guy that's got a bunch of experience. I'm gonna bunch of deployments
01:43:18.66 --> 01:43:23.54 They know as much as we know so cool. We're not attacking them. We're not talking down to them
01:43:24.26 --> 01:43:29.68 So my point is if you have your friends that are trying to help you and
01:43:30.46 --> 01:43:36.30 You reject them. It's really really bad. It's really really bad
01:43:36.30 --> 01:43:41.86 It's it's horrible actually and if you such a bummer to see me it'd be such a bummer to see
01:43:42.38 --> 01:43:48.56 Cuz literally like every guy at trade-at was just hey these are my friends and I'm trying to help and
01:43:50.46 --> 01:43:56.30 If why aren't you open to us helping you please like we don't want you to get hurt man so
01:43:58.26 --> 01:44:00.94 Yeah good times this freaking um
01:44:00.94 --> 01:44:07.46 Great place to learn yeah, and I was like I did that luckily when I was at sealed team one as a
01:44:07.90 --> 01:44:13.34 E5 I worked in our training cell which is when the the team she's trained themselves and so I got to do the same thing
01:44:13.34 --> 01:44:17.78 When I was young and that's where I learned the most of my stuff was doing that again
01:44:17.78 --> 01:44:20.46 Sitting back detached watching guys go through potunes
01:44:20.78 --> 01:44:28.02 We used to run the SQT classes in at the team. Yeah, so that was really eye-opening too because now you had the young officers and
01:44:28.02 --> 01:44:30.02 And
01:44:30.02 --> 01:44:33.60 You'd watch them and think this guy can't make any decision. Why can't you make any decisions?
01:44:33.60 --> 01:44:37.62 Oh, it's cuz he's shooting his right weapon right now and he shouldn't be given the two by four
01:44:37.62 --> 01:44:42.86 Give him a stick let him get off his gun and he'll figure it out and then you actually learn how to do that for yourself
01:44:42.86 --> 01:44:46.02 So yeah, if you want it really want to learn something
01:44:46.02 --> 01:44:52.38 It's really advantageous to have an opportunity to teach it as well. Yeah, that was also where I learned how to like breathe and
01:44:52.98 --> 01:44:57.46 Not I wouldn't say public speak, but you know like when you're talking to team guys
01:44:57.46 --> 01:45:00.02 Yeah, you better be square away. Yeah, because they are
01:45:00.54 --> 01:45:06.90 Chomping at the bit. Oh, yeah to like sense any weakness or anything that you say that's maybe not
01:45:07.02 --> 01:45:12.46 Tactically correct. So it's where I learned to be very deliberate about the way I spoke
01:45:13.06 --> 01:45:17.98 Public a debriefed. Yeah, and if you don't have if you don't have anything that's smart to say
01:45:17.98 --> 01:45:20.46 Don't say anything and if you have a thought
01:45:21.14 --> 01:45:25.70 That you haven't fought through either think through it or presented in such a way that
01:45:25.70 --> 01:45:30.02 It's not like an aggressive attack
01:45:30.94 --> 01:45:37.50 That's absolutely true. You know you're no seal-platoon. You don't have to be in trade it. You're no seal-platoon and you disagree with someone else
01:45:38.90 --> 01:45:44.30 What are the chances that you're 100% right? Yeah, the chance that you're 100% right are almost zero
01:45:44.82 --> 01:45:50.26 So eventually probably two weeks into my first platoon I realized oh
01:45:50.26 --> 01:45:56.82 I'm very seldom going to be a hundred percent right. Why don't I present ideas as if there an idea?
01:45:56.98 --> 01:45:58.18 Not some
01:45:58.18 --> 01:46:05.58 Perfectly formulated perfectly constructed notion that is 100% true because there's so few things that are like that
01:46:06.10 --> 01:46:07.38 Yeah
01:46:07.38 --> 01:46:10.26 Even the most like I talk about in leadership strategy and tactics
01:46:11.38 --> 01:46:18.66 The OIC that I had that was awesome. He knew more than all of us combined and he would present ideas as if they were
01:46:18.66 --> 01:46:23.90 Suggestions and ideas and he was always open to changing those ideas if somebody said something smarter
01:46:24.86 --> 01:46:28.74 So you get to see that stuff over and over again. That's what's that's what's crazy though
01:46:28.74 --> 01:46:31.30 You when you're working at trade-out as you see a platoon tonight
01:46:31.62 --> 01:46:36.68 Do three four five runs another platoon do three four five runs and then a few weeks later
01:46:36.68 --> 01:46:43.10 You're gonna see two other platoons with a bunch of different leadership do the same runs basically the same runs with the same people
01:46:43.10 --> 01:46:49.10 And the variable is the leadership and then a few weeks after that you get to do it again and again and again and again
01:46:49.10 --> 01:46:53.46 And you just start to see what works and what doesn't work and it's real obvious after a certain point
01:46:53.62 --> 01:46:58.18 Yeah, my learning curve was very steep there. How long did you do it trade up?
01:46:58.98 --> 01:47:00.98 So let's see I got there in 2008
01:47:02.62 --> 01:47:04.98 and I think around
01:47:06.42 --> 01:47:10.66 2010 or so it was it was like my time to rotate out, but we had gotten a new chief in and
01:47:10.66 --> 01:47:12.66 And
01:47:13.10 --> 01:47:17.22 So it's time for me to go to my LPO, but the new chief that came in I really liked him a lot
01:47:17.38 --> 01:47:23.90 Just just awesome awesome guy and then he was just like hey, can you stay at trade it a little bit longer and then be my
01:47:23.90 --> 01:47:28.74 LPO when it's my time to go because I'm not gonna be very long. Yeah, he's like I want you to be my LPO
01:47:29.14 --> 01:47:31.42 I'm just like do you know I want to deploy man?
01:47:31.42 --> 01:47:36.62 I thought it's a long time. He's like okay, how about I send you on another argument?
01:47:36.62 --> 01:47:38.86 I'm like I want the full one this time
01:47:38.86 --> 01:47:44.10 So we're working hard hanging here. I was like I want a full deployment. He's like, okay, you got it
01:47:44.30 --> 01:47:47.30 So I went back to Afghanistan
01:47:48.06 --> 01:47:50.06 for another augment
01:47:50.62 --> 01:47:56.26 It's part of the deal size and you're getting some good operational experience on your augments
01:47:56.62 --> 01:48:01.98 Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely live in the dream. Yeah, it was it was really cool
01:48:01.98 --> 01:48:09.98 Just to see you know watch a different team do do different things and yeah, I learned a lot
01:48:09.98 --> 01:48:11.98 I learned a lot from
01:48:11.98 --> 01:48:18.98 It was the first time to where I kind of heard the T.L. like during a gun fight like just how calm and collected they were
01:48:18.98 --> 01:48:25.66 It was just like as if nothing was happening and I didn't I remember that thinking about that in my head like I want to be like that
01:48:25.98 --> 01:48:28.98 You know like okay cool. That's how I'm supposed to be
01:48:28.98 --> 01:48:33.98 You know, so yeah, it was a really good experience again
01:48:34.98 --> 01:48:39.98 And because you know my skin tone I was able to help them out in ways that
01:48:40.98 --> 01:48:43.98 You know, maybe some of the other guys couldn't so some of the targets had to be done like during the daytime
01:48:44.98 --> 01:48:53.98 So we had to like drive around and like milk trucks or something and because you know, I could fit in with the popular side just getting and like the passenger seat and be the navigation guy
01:48:53.98 --> 01:48:59.98 So you're back to being a point man. Yeah, but drive into a local you know hoppyless and you're able to pull that off
01:48:59.98 --> 01:49:04.38 Yeah, and that's also because yeah, so halfway through the deployment though. Okay, we need we need low's back
01:49:04.98 --> 01:49:09.66 Like it assaults and then I was like hey, they want me back and then the team leader there was like let me call them
01:49:09.98 --> 01:49:14.74 It's like actually we really need him over here. So they let me stay there. It's pretty beautiful. Yeah
01:49:15.98 --> 01:49:22.62 But you end up did you end up did you end up then going with your chief in trade at to be his LPO
01:49:22.62 --> 01:49:25.62 No, so around that time
01:49:25.62 --> 01:49:32.62 They sent Johnny Kim over to assaults like just very temporarily because he was on his way to go to school
01:49:32.62 --> 01:49:40.62 So he got picked up for this this program where the Navy picks like two people at the entire Navy and they sent him to go get some of our
01:49:40.62 --> 01:49:42.62 Somehow Johnny Kim slipped through the crash
01:49:42.62 --> 01:49:47.12 Yeah, right so he's like explaining this this program to me
01:49:47.12 --> 01:49:54.12 Were basically you know that the Navy pays for you to go to med school afterwards and it sounded like a good deal and at the time
01:49:54.12 --> 01:49:56.12 You know, I was feeling really guilty
01:49:56.12 --> 01:49:58.12 I'm like the I'm just been gone a lot
01:49:58.12 --> 01:50:04.12 And I was like feeling like I wasn't like the best father to my son even though I tried to spend as much time with him as possible
01:50:04.12 --> 01:50:07.12 I always had that guilt and then there's a part of me
01:50:07.12 --> 01:50:11.12 I was like you know what maybe I should get like a normal job and and be there for my son
01:50:12.12 --> 01:50:16.12 So on a complete win like I put in my package for that exact same program
01:50:16.12 --> 01:50:22.12 And I'm like dude if Johnny Kim is getting accepted to this thing the chances of me getting accepted are like slimmed and none
01:50:22.12 --> 01:50:30.12 And so I'm getting ready to go back to a team with with that chief to go be as LPO and then I'm flying back from an assault trip
01:50:30.12 --> 01:50:37.12 And then he's like hey, did you see the result? I'm like for what like I literally completely just I applied and just forgot about it
01:50:37.12 --> 01:50:39.12 And I dude you got picked up for that program
01:50:39.12 --> 01:50:47.12 Oh my god, are you serious? He's like yeah, so I was like well, I guess get some going to school
01:50:47.12 --> 01:50:57.12 Crazy go try a big doctor. There was a time period and it was this this was the time period where I'm not kidding seals had a really good reputation in the world
01:50:57.12 --> 01:51:03.12 You know and it certainly in the Navy and I man guys were getting picked up left right and center for this kind of stuff
01:51:03.12 --> 01:51:15.12 So I mean that's freaking crazy and awesome. Yeah, so what's funny is you know that I said they picked two people a year at the entire Navy and the other guy was a team guy too
01:51:15.12 --> 01:51:29.12 Yeah, that's my point like that's crazy right. Yeah, but at that time and we like the seals were just doing a lot of good work and I mean I'm sure that when they looked at your record like seriously they looked at your record and
01:51:29.12 --> 01:51:38.32 Compare that to the other applicants I bet it wasn't even really that close just because of the nature of what the seals were doing at the time. Yeah
01:51:38.32 --> 01:51:46.48 So but did you have any intention of like going to medical school for however long that is so I thought I did
01:51:46.48 --> 01:51:49.44 You know
01:51:49.44 --> 01:51:54.72 So you a year behind Johnny yeah, okay, you're you're you're behind Johnny and Johnny went to USD
01:51:54.72 --> 01:52:00.56 So I was just because I'm like yeah, I'm just gonna do what Johnny did so
01:52:01.36 --> 01:52:06.72 So for we had to go to like that officer school it up in Rhode Island so yeah and
01:52:06.72 --> 01:52:10.80 January of 2012 that's when I left trade it and we went to Rhode Island and
01:52:11.76 --> 01:52:14.72 So you learn how to be an officer. Do you get commissioned up there?
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.08 No, you just go to school. Yeah, you just go to school. You don't get commissioned into you graduate from school
01:52:20.08 --> 01:52:26.80 But that's actually where like you know, they're like oh you got to have blue camis. I'm like I don't own any blue camis
01:52:27.52 --> 01:52:33.84 And what's funny about that so I didn't know so they have the you know the big blue jackets and those things are expensive
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.32 Like 350 bucks and I'm already buying all these uniforms that I didn't have because I don't have any blue stuff
01:52:39.32 --> 01:52:41.32 And either you're gonna go to ROTC
01:52:41.32 --> 01:52:48.40 Yeah, what you're gonna have to do yeah after work, but you don't have to wear blue camis for the knife and force cool up in Rhode Island correct
01:52:48.40 --> 01:52:54.04 God it so my but the other team guy that they're with me, you know, we go there and he's he's cheap to
01:52:54.04 --> 01:52:57.96 So he's like oh by this jackass like I don't want by either. I was like screw it. Let's not buy it
01:52:57.96 --> 01:53:01.80 You know, you know jacket you know even though it's Rhode Island in January
01:53:02.48 --> 01:53:06.40 So we form up. Yeah, we form up and I'm in my blue camis
01:53:06.40 --> 01:53:11.96 He's on blue camis and you know the chief the chief who's like the RDC or whatever it's called, you know
01:53:12.32 --> 01:53:15.04 He's like oh how come you guys don't have jackets? I was like well
01:53:15.04 --> 01:53:19.08 We know we didn't want to buy them because we're literally gonna have them here when never gonna use them again
01:53:19.08 --> 01:53:20.08 And they're really expensive
01:53:20.08 --> 01:53:22.96 He's like well, we're all uniformed around here
01:53:22.96 --> 01:53:28.56 So they make everybody take their jackets off and it's it's freezing cool and then
01:53:28.96 --> 01:53:34.08 He's like we'll keep doing this until you guys buy jackets and I told my buddy
01:53:34.08 --> 01:53:36.08 Don't you dare buy a jacket?
01:53:36.08 --> 01:53:40.24 It's like okay cool and we were freezing cold, but we would just sit there and be like we're not cold
01:53:40.24 --> 01:53:41.68 But we were we're dying
01:53:41.68 --> 01:53:45.68 And got to the point where they're like you know people started crying in the class like literally like oh
01:53:46.24 --> 01:53:48.64 You know freezing cold, so they're like all right changing to your cackies
01:53:49.36 --> 01:53:52.88 I was like okay, I'll buy the jacket for the cackies come part. I might use that later on
01:53:54.64 --> 01:53:59.84 So you're done with that and then you go to you go to you list usd
01:54:01.36 --> 01:54:04.16 University of San Diego you're gonna be doing the same
01:54:05.60 --> 01:54:09.60 Whatever the same thing Johnny did yeah trying to get your pre-med knocked out
01:54:09.60 --> 01:54:12.56 Yeah, how'd that go for you?
01:54:12.56 --> 01:54:14.56 Not well
01:54:14.56 --> 01:54:16.56 Johnny Kim
01:54:18.40 --> 01:54:23.28 I'm miserable, you know, I'm I'm taken like 18 to 21 units a semester
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:24.96 I
01:54:24.96 --> 01:54:31.36 Really didn't enjoy the classes I was taking like chemistry biology just stuff that was so boring to me
01:54:32.16 --> 01:54:36.40 And then a top at all off. I'm I'm doing parking services because you know USD's a private school
01:54:36.40 --> 01:54:42.24 And the Navy only pays like I think it was like I don't I shouldn't say only they pay 10k
01:54:43.12 --> 01:54:47.28 And the tuition at USD's like 40k a year like 40 something k a year so
01:54:47.84 --> 01:54:51.44 They're like hey if you do parking services it'll pay off the rest of your tuition
01:54:51.92 --> 01:54:53.92 So it's a good deal like if you really break it down
01:54:54.48 --> 01:54:56.08 The amount of hours that you work
01:54:56.08 --> 01:55:03.44 It's a really good deal so I'm driving around this this car giving people tickets at USD and bad karma dude
01:55:03.44 --> 01:55:09.76 Yeah, well, I almost you know almost gotten to this big altercation at one point so
01:55:11.12 --> 01:55:14.24 You know that so this other team guy you're the worst ticket guy to mess with
01:55:15.28 --> 01:55:19.84 Fatsin that you think you're getting a thing you know already with some random ticket do you know it's freaking loves
01:55:19.84 --> 01:55:21.28 Prop
01:55:21.84 --> 01:55:24.56 Well, it's you know it's funny it's like if I have to hear you know
01:55:24.56 --> 01:55:29.60 Do you know my dad is one more time just like bro? I don't know your dad is I'm really sorry, but you know you're parking the handicaps box
01:55:30.32 --> 01:55:32.32 but at one point
01:55:32.32 --> 01:55:37.68 So the parking so it's me and another team guy so that the other parking services kids, you know
01:55:37.68 --> 01:55:41.20 They actually they're normal kids. I won't go on a school and I like oh if you guys want to get a lot of tickets
01:55:41.20 --> 01:55:47.68 You got to go down to this area right here and it was like where the football field or the baseball field was you know by the gym
01:55:47.68 --> 01:55:49.04 You went to USD right?
01:55:49.04 --> 01:55:53.04 You know what I'm talking about so my buddy. I didn't do ticket parking
01:55:53.84 --> 01:55:59.68 I said I said put my bike in my station wagon and just I would park off campus and just bike whatever
01:55:59.68 --> 01:56:03.52 Need me bike on bike back in my car and drive home. Yeah, so at one point, you know
01:56:03.52 --> 01:56:07.12 I we go down there and it's like it's like the jackpot of all
01:56:07.68 --> 01:56:12.08 Like violations like we got because we were having trouble meeting our quota so this other team guy
01:56:12.08 --> 01:56:15.52 And I you know the other parking service kids like if you go down in this area you get lots of tickets
01:56:15.52 --> 01:56:19.36 So we go down there and we're like oh heck yeah, yeah, there's all kinds of violations down there
01:56:19.36 --> 01:56:23.76 Like we met our quota super quick and at one point I had come up to this car and I you know
01:56:23.76 --> 01:56:27.28 You got to punch in the license plate to to give him the ticket and it was like
01:56:27.28 --> 01:56:32.32 Do not let like call the office immediately if you see if you get this license plate
01:56:32.32 --> 01:56:38.32 Everyone okay, yeah, so I call it. I'm like hey this thing came up on my little gadget and then I do not let that person leave
01:56:38.32 --> 01:56:44.32 They have like nine unpaid tickets or something like that. I was insane about I'm like what do you want me to do?
01:56:45.04 --> 01:56:49.20 Like park your cart behind his car until the tow truck gets there and do not let them leave
01:56:49.68 --> 01:56:54.32 I'm like is that legal are we allowed to do that and and and they're like yeah
01:56:54.32 --> 01:56:59.20 So I'm like okay, so I parked my park my cart behind this car the other team guy
01:56:59.20 --> 01:57:00.96 I don't know where he took off to like he's gone
01:57:01.52 --> 01:57:06.64 He must have been fine and like lots of tickets and so I'm sitting there and waiting for the tow truck and now
01:57:06.64 --> 01:57:08.64 I see everybody get out of football practice and
01:57:10.08 --> 01:57:13.28 The guys car the car who's you know
01:57:13.52 --> 01:57:16.08 Part behind the owner comes and it's a really big dude
01:57:16.32 --> 01:57:19.60 You know he's free of football player free jack dude big dude. He's like
01:57:20.40 --> 01:57:22.40 Hey, you need to move your cart
01:57:22.40 --> 01:57:27.60 I was like hey bro there seems to be a problem like you know with your ticket stuff
01:57:28.16 --> 01:57:32.56 I'm like they called the tow truck but I think if you call them, you know and work something out
01:57:33.04 --> 01:57:35.04 He's like
01:57:35.04 --> 01:57:40.56 Move your fucking car. I was like I can't you know they told me this and and now it's starting to be cut
01:57:40.56 --> 01:57:43.36 And I'm really like trying to be like hey bro like listen
01:57:43.36 --> 01:57:47.68 I am like the low man on the total pull and now the rest of the football team is coming out
01:57:47.68 --> 01:57:52.000 And now they're getting fired up and now I'm sitting there and I'm like where the hell is this other team guy at
01:57:52.56 --> 01:57:55.60 This is a matter how good of a fighter you are there's a punch of that. We're gonna get trash kicked
01:57:56.08 --> 01:57:59.44 So and then the guys like move your cart now. I'm gonna beat your ass
01:57:59.92 --> 01:58:03.36 Now I'm like listen bro. I really don't want that but listen if you put your hands on me
01:58:03.36 --> 01:58:05.12 I'm telling right now. I'm gonna defend myself and
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.60 At that point I'm thinking dang it man. This is really gonna happen and
01:58:10.08 --> 01:58:13.12 Some guy comes running through them all and then he's like hey
01:58:13.44 --> 01:58:15.44 Do you know who this guy is?
01:58:15.44 --> 01:58:19.36 And I'm like who is this guy and yeah, who am I like who is this guy? I am
01:58:19.92 --> 01:58:24.80 You know and then he's like he's freaking maybe seal and then you just see their attitude
01:58:24.80 --> 01:58:29.44 Come pully please like oh I'm really sorry sir like I didn't know you know
01:58:29.44 --> 01:58:32.16 I and I was like hey bro. It's really cool like you know
01:58:32.16 --> 01:58:34.24 I'm pretty sure if you just call you can work something out
01:58:34.40 --> 01:58:41.12 Turns out this guy was the running back was a prior team guy. Oh no sure and he knew that the parking service is guys
01:58:41.12 --> 01:58:48.40 We're other team guys that we're trying to you know pay for the rest of their tuition so he saved me that day because I'm probably wasn't gonna go down very pretty for me
01:58:50.24 --> 01:58:54.96 And then you eventually just change to change your major and you get out of the medical program
01:58:55.36 --> 01:58:58.72 Yeah, so at some point I'm just like I took a finance class as one of my
01:58:59.12 --> 01:59:02.16 Electives and I'm like man I really like this and I really miss the teams
01:59:02.16 --> 01:59:06.16 I don't think I want to do this medical thing so I change my major without telling anybody and
01:59:06.64 --> 01:59:09.76 Then when they're like oh, so where are you gonna go to med school? I was like about that
01:59:09.76 --> 01:59:13.28 I'm actually I want to go back to the teams if that's okay
01:59:13.44 --> 01:59:16.32 So I want to finish my degree and go back to the teams and they were a live it
01:59:16.88 --> 01:59:22.88 Damn they're just like teams like no you're you're going slow you're gonna go be a surface work
01:59:22.88 --> 01:59:25.36 Oh my god, so now I'm just like
01:59:26.64 --> 01:59:30.56 I don't know what to do so you know I make some phone calls and they're like that's stupid
01:59:30.56 --> 01:59:32.56 You're not gonna go be a slow you're turning back here
01:59:32.96 --> 01:59:37.04 The only the only problem is you're gonna have to go to the process just like everyone else
01:59:37.04 --> 01:59:39.84 So I have to take the screener do an interview
01:59:41.04 --> 01:59:44.40 I'm like yeah, that's totally fine. So I do the screener
01:59:44.40 --> 01:59:51.28 I go do the interview and one of the interviewers is one of my old co from team one and he knows who I am
01:59:52.56 --> 01:59:57.44 So I'm thinking oh this is gonna go great, you know and at one point he asks me
01:59:58.40 --> 02:00:03.52 He's like hey, so what are you gonna do if you don't get picked up for for special warfare
02:00:03.52 --> 02:00:08.24 And then um as an officer, you know and I sound was like well
02:00:08.80 --> 02:00:11.76 I am just gonna give up my commission and go back to being and listen
02:00:12.16 --> 02:00:14.88 And you just see everyone's head just go oh
02:00:15.44 --> 02:00:19.68 And then that moment just seen the expression on their faces. I was like oh man
02:00:19.68 --> 02:00:21.68 I said something I wasn't supposed to
02:00:22.88 --> 02:00:24.24 And you know
02:00:24.24 --> 02:00:28.56 Because you're supposed to say hey, I want to be an officer no matter what and
02:00:28.56 --> 02:00:35.60 And he was really cool about it. He's like listen, low, you know, you know why I mean it's like I'm gonna give you one more chance at this
02:00:35.60 --> 02:00:37.60 Okay, I'm gonna give you another crack at it
02:00:37.60 --> 02:00:39.60 I wasn't the best answer
02:00:39.60 --> 02:00:41.28 And then I sat there and I'm like
02:00:41.28 --> 02:00:43.60 Dang it. I might have messed this up
02:00:43.60 --> 02:00:46.72 So I sat there for a minute and just thought about it and I'm like you know what sir?
02:00:47.12 --> 02:00:49.76 I know that the correct answer that you want to hear is like
02:00:50.32 --> 02:00:51.76 If you don't get picked up for this
02:00:51.76 --> 02:00:57.12 I'm gonna go be the best swore the best sub-mariner officer on the planet and then I'm gonna make my way back
02:00:57.12 --> 02:01:02.16 But I'll be honest with you. I don't want to do that. I was like I just want to be in the teams and
02:01:02.16 --> 02:01:06.32 Whether that says an IPO achieve or is an officer. I was like that's why I'm doing this
02:01:06.32 --> 02:01:10.80 I miss the teams. I want to go back and he's like that's the answer you want to go with
02:01:10.88 --> 02:01:12.88 I'm like yes, sir. It's just the truth
02:01:13.76 --> 02:01:15.76 And then he's like to bold move
02:01:16.08 --> 02:01:18.08 Don't know if it's gonna work out for you
02:01:18.08 --> 02:01:20.56 I like that but yeah eventually I got picked up so
02:01:22.48 --> 02:01:24.48 Back to the teams
02:01:24.48 --> 02:01:29.84 So where'd you go? What team so I was originally supposed to go to team five and
02:01:30.64 --> 02:01:36.08 That old chief that I was talking about the one why me be his opio and then the master chief who was the SCA
02:01:36.08 --> 02:01:39.36 Assaults there they're like hey because they came to my commissioning like we're going

02:02:28.72 --> 02:02:31.12 You know, he's a really good dude. He's just a little
02:02:32.48 --> 02:02:34.80 They used the word timid. He's just kind of shy
02:02:34.80 --> 02:02:38.40 He wasn't a very outspoken guy and then when I heard him brief and I heard him on the radio
02:02:38.40 --> 02:02:41.84 I'm like oh, I see where's like I have no problem getting on the radio
02:02:41.84 --> 02:02:43.04 I've no problem briefing
02:02:43.04 --> 02:02:50.40 So we actually complement each other very well because he was a good officer like he knew officer things that I did not
02:02:50.72 --> 02:02:56.32 So he showed me how to be you know like ground force commander. He showed me like all the checklists all the procedures and
02:02:57.04 --> 02:03:01.04 And yeah, it was it was a good experience and I got a lot of reps
02:03:01.68 --> 02:03:05.60 You know being the OIC because I was I was good on the radio
02:03:05.60 --> 02:03:09.28 So I got a lot of reps and our our chief was a complete stud who I'd went to Buds with
02:03:09.28 --> 02:03:14.88 So I learned a ton from him too. He's a J-Taxle. He taught me a lot about being ground force commander
02:03:15.20 --> 02:03:17.92 Where did you guys go into plunder we ended up going to
02:03:18.32 --> 02:03:20.32 Alta Cateum
02:03:20.08 --> 02:03:21.44 Yeah
02:03:21.44 --> 02:03:25.60 So we were there for the double a just advised an assist
02:03:26.08 --> 02:03:28.80 So there was no a company at that time
02:03:29.28 --> 02:03:33.04 So we were just behind the flaw just calling in helping them
02:03:33.04 --> 02:03:39.60 I rack his call in air to try to retake Alambar which had been retaken by bicell
02:03:40.64 --> 02:03:42.96 You know whatever the name of the week was for them yeah
02:03:44.08 --> 02:03:46.08 And that's
02:03:46.32 --> 02:03:49.28 How's the platoon what is the platoon doing as you're doing that?
02:03:50.88 --> 02:03:54.32 I mean so really the only ones that are working are the J-Taxle
02:03:55.36 --> 02:03:57.36 Yeah, they're really the only ones that are working
02:03:58.88 --> 02:04:00.88 But I mean at least you're freaking killing bad guys
02:04:00.88 --> 02:04:01.68 Yeah, absolutely
02:04:01.68 --> 02:04:07.76 But we're also eating motors a lot because we can't go forward
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.28 So we're just sitting back there eating motors and at one point
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.72 The motors got really really close to us blue one of our homies up
02:04:16.40 --> 02:04:19.68 As I was running towards it this homie gets hit just
02:04:20.80 --> 02:04:22.80 Close me on my ass
02:04:22.80 --> 02:04:25.44 So just definitely a TBI
02:04:25.92 --> 02:04:28.72 So they like put me on TBI protocol for a little bit but
02:04:28.72 --> 02:04:30.72 But
02:04:30.72 --> 02:04:33.68 Right around that time I get an email telling me like hey
02:04:34.48 --> 02:04:36.56 From this chief of mine now he's the SEA now
02:04:36.56 --> 02:04:40.64 He's the SEA at this point. He's like hey, los you're you know we're gonna actually send you to Baghdad
02:04:41.44 --> 02:04:44.000 And you're gonna replace this J-O is the strike so commander
02:04:45.28 --> 02:04:51.28 I'm thinking like why like I don't know anything about J-Taxle stuff and the J-O that was there
02:04:51.28 --> 02:04:53.28 He'd actually gone to like a J-Taxle
02:04:53.28 --> 02:04:59.76 Really really intelligent guy like super intelligent waste smarter than me and I'm like what am I gonna do over there?
02:05:00.08 --> 02:05:02.08 I don't know anything about
02:05:02.08 --> 02:05:04.80 You know, and he's like and so it's funny because
02:05:05.92 --> 02:05:10.96 As I'm getting on the Hilo to leave he's getting there and we're crossing paths and I'm like bro
02:05:10.96 --> 02:05:15.44 Why am I getting sent there like I don't know what I'm doing he's like don't worry about it dude people like you
02:05:16.16 --> 02:05:18.16 I'm just like okay
02:05:18.16 --> 02:05:20.16 He's like you're gonna be fine
02:05:20.16 --> 02:05:23.28 So I know it gets a Baghdad and and I
02:05:23.28 --> 02:05:26.32 I'm getting the turnover from this J-O and I could immediately see
02:05:26.88 --> 02:05:32.16 That these gent the general there is just not a fan of ours and then through conversation
02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.76 We had we had we had burned some relationships there
02:05:38.96 --> 02:05:43.84 And backtracking though when I checked into team three guess who my CEO is
02:05:44.72 --> 02:05:46.72 It's my first OIC
02:05:46.72 --> 02:05:51.12 Right on man and you want to talk about like a lack of relationship building
02:05:51.92 --> 02:05:57.12 When I show up he was just like hey you're that guy that got in trouble for such and such thing
02:05:57.60 --> 02:05:59.84 Right on and I'm like you can awesome no
02:06:00.32 --> 02:06:05.52 I'm like that wasn't me that was someone else who doesn't even look like me like he's a white dude
02:06:05.52 --> 02:06:07.52 Like it's nothing like me
02:06:07.52 --> 02:06:10.56 So I'm like way to go man we spent two years together and you're in a who I am
02:06:10.96 --> 02:06:12.16 That's great
02:06:12.16 --> 02:06:16.48 Yeah, but anyway, so back to the story the the relationship had definitely been
02:06:16.48 --> 02:06:19.28 Strange I could just tell by the way this this general was talking to the J-O
02:06:20.08 --> 02:06:21.36 It's just like
02:06:21.36 --> 02:06:23.36 He did not like us and
02:06:23.84 --> 02:06:28.88 You know like I said this J-O was very brilliant really knew his J-Tax stuff and so now I'm left there
02:06:29.92 --> 02:06:32.16 And I'm thinking like man we got a repair this relationship
02:06:32.64 --> 02:06:36.48 So that's actually the first thing I started doing the general was a Marine Corps general
02:06:37.20 --> 02:06:40.56 And so I was just chatting him up just like hey, you know where we're station where you station now
02:06:40.56 --> 02:06:41.68 He's like oh camp penulton
02:06:41.68 --> 02:06:43.28 I'm like oh that was my first duty station
02:06:43.28 --> 02:06:49.28 He's like what are you doing there? I was like oh he's the B&F MF Corment and yeah his eyes just light up
02:06:49.84 --> 02:06:55.04 And from that point on you know him and I just start chatting and then I you know start asking him like hey, you know
02:06:55.60 --> 02:06:59.36 What is it that you guys are looking for when you're looking for these for these strikes to be approved?
02:06:59.84 --> 02:07:02.32 What can we do to help out what you guys are doing?
02:07:02.32 --> 02:07:06.72 He's like as a matter of fact, you know we need this this and that and I'm like check let me see what we can do about it
02:07:07.36 --> 02:07:09.36 And so what my job was
02:07:09.36 --> 02:07:12.56 Was I would get all these air strikes for the next day
02:07:12.56 --> 02:07:18.000 That my platoon wanted to carry out strategically strategic air strikes and I had to brief them to
02:07:18.64 --> 02:07:24.08 To him and another general to the one and a two-star general get him approved in a room full of kernels that were all
02:07:24.08 --> 02:07:26.56 Jags and super risk adverse like they were
02:07:27.04 --> 02:07:32.40 Denying a lot of the air strikes and that's the reason why I said me over there like hey a lot of our stuff's getting denied go see if maybe you can change that up
02:07:33.60 --> 02:07:38.24 So so I go in there and and I grab one of my TATX
02:07:38.24 --> 02:07:42.88 You know this is actually of where I had like what another epiphany where I'm like you know what is a leader?
02:07:42.88 --> 02:07:47.92 I don't have to know everything. I'm like I have someone who went to J-Tax school
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.76 So I'm just gonna lean on them because at the time I'm like I don't know what I'm doing
02:07:51.76 --> 02:07:56.64 I was really like insecure about it like I'm gonna go in there and just not know what to brief
02:07:56.64 --> 02:07:58.08 So I told him I'm like hey listen
02:07:58.08 --> 02:08:04.08 I'm gonna brief strategic picture like why we're doing these air strikes anything technical you can answer it
02:08:04.08 --> 02:08:09.44 And he was like check so that's how I would do my briefs and like I said I built that relationship with that general
02:08:09.44 --> 02:08:15.36 So every time I briefed you know and they went around the corner taking the vote he would always take my side and once he was in
02:08:15.60 --> 02:08:18.64 The two-star was gonna be in as well no matter what the Jack said
02:08:19.44 --> 02:08:21.44 So from that point on
02:08:21.44 --> 02:08:24.32 From I could remember we got all our air strikes approved from that point on
02:08:24.80 --> 02:08:26.40 It was just a simple
02:08:26.40 --> 02:08:30.000 Relationship building what what had the J-O the smart J-O
02:08:30.80 --> 02:08:33.12 Was it something he did or was it just he was not
02:08:33.12 --> 02:08:35.12 How something are you doing?
02:08:35.12 --> 02:08:40.000 So just how to bad relationship out of the gate. Yeah, yeah, and then he had a bad taste in his mouth
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.96 I think team guys on that particular deployment
02:08:42.96 --> 02:08:47.60 He made some some comments here and there that I caught on very quickly like check
02:08:49.76 --> 02:08:53.76 Freakin horrible and you're did are you married again at this point?
02:08:54.64 --> 02:08:56.64 Yeah, so
02:08:57.20 --> 02:09:01.12 So yeah, so when I was in trade it I actually met my wife she was my waitress
02:09:01.12 --> 02:09:04.08 a very a classy establishment
02:09:05.92 --> 02:09:07.92 Jack called butters
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.40 But I went in there with a team guy and I remember seeing her and I'm thinking like oh my god
02:09:14.40 --> 02:09:19.20 She's gorgeous like there's absolutely no way someone like that would you know go for someone like me and
02:09:19.92 --> 02:09:22.24 And turns out that I had gone a couple dates with one of her friends
02:09:23.04 --> 02:09:26.64 So she had told so she told her friend she's like oh, you know I saw that that guy
02:09:26.64 --> 02:09:29.44 He said at my table that you were dating. She's like oh, we're not dating anymore
02:09:29.44 --> 02:09:36.24 She was like do you care if I get his number? She's like no, so yeah, so that's how he ended up meeting and
02:09:37.28 --> 02:09:43.20 So at this point, you know, we've been together for a while since trade it and now I was already you know
02:09:44.08 --> 02:09:49.36 Am I OIC and she's just like hey you need to marry me if you don't marry me before this deployment
02:09:49.36 --> 02:09:51.36 And I'm not gonna be here when you get back
02:09:52.16 --> 02:09:54.16 So ultimately I'm delivered
02:09:54.16 --> 02:10:01.60 And and it you know is a hard decision for me because I was like man I love this woman but we you know
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:08.56 Vodalot and during that deployment that one to Tyrak our relationship was very very stressed
02:10:09.28 --> 02:10:14.40 You had just got married before you went on the pool yeah, yeah, yeah, and I'm thinking to myself like you know
02:10:14.40 --> 02:10:18.96 I'm gonna fail at this marriage thing again like what am I what what am I doing wrong here
02:10:18.96 --> 02:10:25.04 And what's crazy is like when I was at trade at you know you talked about the the four laws of combat a lot and we talked about like
02:10:25.36 --> 02:10:31.12 Find what your red flags are and in the teams my red flag when I got overwhelmed was
02:10:32.96 --> 02:10:37.76 You know when that thought came in my head like I don't know what to do right now. That was my cue to detach
02:10:38.64 --> 02:10:40.64 Prioritize an excuse and
02:10:40.96 --> 02:10:45.68 For the longest time I thought that these four laws of combat this this ocean was only
02:10:45.68 --> 02:10:50.24 Combat related and it was the first time in my life where I realized that
02:10:51.36 --> 02:10:55.20 It's for your personal life too because at that point, you know I got back from the poiment
02:10:55.20 --> 02:11:00.000 We're still fighting a lot, but I'm like man. I love this woman. I don't want I don't want to fail at this marriage thing again
02:11:00.32 --> 02:11:02.72 And in my head I thought I don't know what to do right now
02:11:03.84 --> 02:11:06.32 And that's when I clicked for me like wait a minute
02:11:06.32 --> 02:11:09.76 I've had this thought like literally hundreds of times when I'm on training missions
02:11:09.76 --> 02:11:14.88 I'm like well I'm a little overwhelmed. I don't know what to do right now detach prioritize execute and so at that point
02:11:14.88 --> 02:11:21.04 I'm like I need to attach prioritize an excuse in my personal life and it was at that point in my life
02:11:21.04 --> 02:11:25.52 Why decided to start taking ownership of of my mistakes and realize that you know what?
02:11:25.60 --> 02:11:29.28 I'm an imperfect human being too and I stopped concentrating on
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000 Everything that I thought was a flaw
02:11:32.80 --> 02:11:37.44 On her part and just started concentrating on how I could become a better husband
02:11:38.64 --> 02:11:42.80 So I'm like hey, you know what this is what I do wrong and this is how I can fix it
02:11:42.80 --> 02:11:46.88 I have no control over attitude. I have no the things that I had don't have control over
02:11:46.88 --> 02:11:51.28 I stopped worrying about them and I started concentrating on the things that I could control
02:11:52.40 --> 02:11:56.80 And at first it was a little bit of a campaign because you could tell she was like what are you doing?
02:11:59.12 --> 02:12:03.12 And then and then it got to the point where she started doing the same thing
02:12:03.76 --> 02:12:08.16 Like we just started taking ownership of our parts of the marriage and I stopped worrying about what she did wrong
02:12:08.16 --> 02:12:13.44 And only worried about what I was doing wrong and she eventually she started to do the same and her marriage is
02:12:14.24 --> 02:12:19.68 Completely turned around since then and you know, I'm a little marriage you got peaks and valleys, but it's it's been
02:12:21.52 --> 02:12:22.72 Amazing
02:12:22.72 --> 02:12:27.52 Kind of like when you're in a platoon like where everybody's taking ownership of stuff for no one's blaming anybody else
02:12:27.60 --> 02:12:32.48 Which is trying to solve problems. And that's how that environment finally was in my marriage
02:12:33.12 --> 02:12:35.12 So yeah, it's
02:12:35.12 --> 02:12:38.80 It's funny when you talk about like when you're in a platoon and everyone starts taking ownership stuff
02:12:38.80 --> 02:12:40.16 You know problems get solved
02:12:40.16 --> 02:12:42.80 What's crazy is the opposite of that?
02:12:43.52 --> 02:12:48.80 It's not one level of badness when people aren't taking ownership because when they're not taking ownership
02:12:48.80 --> 02:12:53.68 They're blaming each other so it's not just oh we're gonna blame each other and that's that's not good
02:12:54.08 --> 02:12:59.36 That's not good, but guess what else is coming now? We're fighting where yelling each other like it causes
02:12:59.36 --> 02:13:05.84 Exponential problems beyond just it's not just oh if I take ownership the problems get solved if I don't take ownership
02:13:05.84 --> 02:13:09.36 The problems don't get solved if it was that simple it'd be like you probably deal with it
02:13:09.52 --> 02:13:13.92 But it's now we actually are fighting we're undermining each other we're yelling at each other
02:13:13.92 --> 02:13:21.12 We we're turning to freaking idiots and so yeah, and that can happen in people's personal lives, too
02:13:21.12 --> 02:13:28.000 You know you it's not just that oh well we've got this problem in our marriage and it's not my fault
02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.32 It's your fault if that's where it stopped
02:13:31.04 --> 02:13:35.76 You might be able to muddle you away through it, but that's not where it stops. Yeah, it stopped me say it's your fault
02:13:35.76 --> 02:13:37.76 What do you mean is my fault?
02:13:37.76 --> 02:13:43.04 Actually here's some of the nine things that are your fault and but all of a sudden we have not just one little problem
02:13:43.12 --> 02:13:45.44 That's not getting solved you have exponential
02:13:45.92 --> 02:13:50.08 Problems across the board it's a freaking disaster. Yeah, it's a game changer
02:13:50.64 --> 02:13:51.76 um
02:13:51.76 --> 02:13:53.76 Now you came back from that deployment and
02:13:53.76 --> 02:14:00.48 You actually did a couple years where you were doing some some classified stuff
02:14:01.68 --> 02:14:03.68 overseas and
02:14:04.56 --> 02:14:06.56 Obviously we can't talk about things that are classified
02:14:07.12 --> 02:14:11.44 But maybe some unclassified lessons learned from what you were doing yeah
02:14:13.84 --> 02:14:18.000 I think the biggest thing that I learned while I was over there is is how to build relationships
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:24.40 Hmm and honestly I got I got really into it and I started trying to perfect that craft by reading books
02:14:24.40 --> 02:14:27.68 So I started reading books like how to win friends and influence people
02:14:28.32 --> 02:14:34.48 The like switch like anything I could help get my hands on because I knew that when I was over there
02:14:34.72 --> 02:14:36.72 It was just gonna be me and one other operator
02:14:37.52 --> 02:14:42.08 That's it we didn't have like a support system we didn't have a platoon that was that was us
02:14:42.64 --> 02:14:47.20 So we had to build a good relationship with like the local populist in a very short amount of time
02:14:47.20 --> 02:14:49.92 Um, we had to build a relationship with our interpreter
02:14:50.80 --> 02:14:56.32 And that's really honestly when it boils onto it our lives dependent on these relationships because at times
02:14:56.88 --> 02:14:59.28 You're asking some of these people to risk their lives for you
02:15:00.24 --> 02:15:04.96 And so that's where I really started delving into how do I get people to trust and
02:15:05.20 --> 02:15:08.56 Like me to the point where I can influence them in the shortest amount of time
02:15:09.36 --> 02:15:13.04 That's really the biggest lesson I got out of those two years from doing that that mission set
02:15:13.20 --> 02:15:14.000 Yeah
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:20.72 Well, that's and that's something that applies across the board. You know that's funny when you're talking about the switch going off in your head of like oh
02:15:21.12 --> 02:15:24.88 I can use this that's the same thing that happened that's what started all this stuff
02:15:24.88 --> 02:15:27.52 I went and talked to these freaking executives about leadership
02:15:27.84 --> 02:15:33.60 They started asking me questions and I was just applying the principles the four laws combat take ownership
02:15:33.60 --> 02:15:38.32 Like that's what I started and it was 30 it was the first question I got asked. I was like oh
02:15:39.20 --> 02:15:43.20 Oh, you have this problem. Okay. Here's how you solve it just based on the principles that we already know
02:15:43.20 --> 02:15:45.20 Yeah, it's like a freaking
02:15:46.40 --> 02:15:49.20 Such a nice moment in my life. I was like oh
02:15:49.44 --> 02:15:52.72 Because I did again. I think I was totally in search of the institutionized
02:15:52.72 --> 02:15:56.32 I didn't understand I didn't know anything about civilian companies
02:15:56.32 --> 02:16:02.48 I didn't know anything up at all about them and all of a sudden I realized in an instant that oh all this stuff applies
02:16:03.20 --> 02:16:08.40 To all these leadership situations man and that's the same thing going back to building relationships
02:16:08.40 --> 02:16:16.16 Like oh yeah guess what have you ever had a moment in your life where having an antagonistic relationship with someone you got to work with helps
02:16:16.56 --> 02:16:20.32 It's like that that that that doesn't ever happen anybody ever never happened where oh
02:16:20.32 --> 02:16:25.28 I don't get along with this person and I have to work with and it's beneficial to me doesn't happen
02:16:25.44 --> 02:16:27.44 So why are you not focused on
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.84 Getting to build relationships with people it's freaking crazy but good lessons
02:16:31.84 --> 02:16:39.04 Um you come back from that and you go back to trade it again, right? Yeah, I go back to trade it as the exo this time
02:16:39.92 --> 02:16:43.28 Exo trade it. Yeah, what are you are you will you attend it now?
02:16:43.76 --> 02:16:50.24 I'm a jail still or jj a jg yeah, yeah, yeah, because I did my so I because I didn't have to go through bugs
02:16:50.24 --> 02:16:55.60 Everything else. I did my first deployment as an instant. Yeah, and so you know I'm a jg now and
02:16:55.60 --> 02:17:01.36 And because I'm prior and listen and I knew the CEO there at the time who's most so prior and let's say guy
02:17:01.36 --> 02:17:03.36 Cause actually him and I had done a deployment
02:17:03.36 --> 02:17:05.36 So they we'd done that I racked the planet together
02:17:05.36 --> 02:17:08.24 Okay, at team one and he was like yeah come on over
02:17:08.64 --> 02:17:12.24 I was like you know I I need to do a disassociated tour
02:17:12.88 --> 02:17:17.76 Is there like you need to because I was like hey can I go back and do my platoon commander? Yeah, and they're like no
02:17:18.08 --> 02:17:23.12 They're like you need to get away from it for a little bit because you know they have like a limit on how much time you could be deployed
02:17:23.12 --> 02:17:28.40 Mmm and they're like dude you're like right there you need to you need to go somewhere and take a knee
02:17:28.40 --> 02:17:33.76 So I'm like trade it sounds good. I really like I really enjoyed my time there and so I decided to go back
02:17:34.16 --> 02:17:39.94 And then you're doing the exo billet, which is not quite as fun as doing that. It's not definitely not as fun as being
02:17:39.94 --> 02:17:45.60 Not what I thought it was gonna be so the CEO actually gets the funer job for sure because he's actually
02:17:45.60 --> 02:17:50.48 Going to the training trips and debriefing as the exo you're dealing with
02:17:50.48 --> 02:17:56.96 Yeah, everything else and the admin stuff the disciplinary problems getting on the the meetings at group
02:17:57.52 --> 02:18:02.32 Yeah, yeah, you're I'm man my career was such a freaking
02:18:03.44 --> 02:18:07.88 I was just so lucky at everything like when I was just the death of the L. I see you know
02:18:07.88 --> 02:18:11.60 So just getting just going out and training trips and freaking awesome this
02:18:12.56 --> 02:18:17.60 What point so how many years do you have in at this point? This is like 2018 so you're coming up on 20
02:18:17.60 --> 02:18:22.000 Yeah, this is when you start thinking about maybe doing something else
02:18:22.56 --> 02:18:27.52 Yeah, so I mean I figured I had the time so I'm like, I'm gonna go knock out my MBA
02:18:27.52 --> 02:18:31.36 I always really enjoyed business and then through conversations
02:18:31.36 --> 02:18:35.04 They were like hey after this they were like you can't do your your
02:18:36.24 --> 02:18:43.08 Oh, I see until I 20 24 something like that. I'm like what am I gonna do until then?
02:18:43.08 --> 02:18:45.08 Like you do more dissociated tours
02:18:45.08 --> 02:18:48.76 And I'm like you know what that doesn't sound interesting to me
02:18:48.76 --> 02:18:52.84 So I think I'm just gonna retire. I mean at that point I was gonna hit 20
02:18:53.96 --> 02:18:56.52 So I'm like you know what I'm gonna go get my MBA and
02:18:57.56 --> 02:18:58.84 And punch out
02:18:58.84 --> 02:19:04.28 entire so that's at that point where I started looking into MBA programs and and trying to see where I was gonna go
02:19:04.28 --> 02:19:09.96 And you're gonna go back to USD no, right now. I went to UCLA. Oh, you went to UCLA
02:19:10.12 --> 02:19:12.36 Yeah, yeah, it was funny about that
02:19:12.36 --> 02:19:17.48 I was really set on like getting an M7 school. You know like the magazine seven
02:19:17.48 --> 02:19:23.88 So like I'm only gonna go to like war and her boo-ther MIT or one of those and so those are the only ones
02:19:23.88 --> 02:19:26.52 I applied to and I realized that the GI bill doesn't cover
02:19:27.24 --> 02:19:29.24 those because they're private schools
02:19:30.44 --> 02:19:36.76 Even though like some of them actually had lower tuition than UCLA and at that point I had a really good friend of mine
02:19:36.76 --> 02:19:41.80 Well, my best friends if you look at his resume. It looks almost exactly like mine like FMF Corman
02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.76 You know teams USD finance degree and then he's like hey, bro
02:19:46.76 --> 02:19:49.88 I'm actually gonna go to UCLA and I'm like why is that?
02:19:50.52 --> 02:19:54.28 And then he's like dude, dude, GI bill pays for it because it's a public school
02:19:55.32 --> 02:20:00.44 And I struggled with that for a little bit. I built as a cover private schools. It only covers like a small portion
02:20:00.44 --> 02:20:02.84 I was still gonna have to take out like a six figure
02:20:02.84 --> 02:20:09.32 Just a six figure student loan and I've always been pretty frugal about my money on my day
02:20:09.32 --> 02:20:15.24 I don't want to take out this huge loan and then I kind of went into thought I'm like why do I want to go to one of these schools
02:20:15.96 --> 02:20:17.56 Like why do I really want to go?
02:20:17.56 --> 02:20:19.96 And at some point I realize I just want people to think I'm smart
02:20:21.80 --> 02:20:26.76 I mean, we really like you know bullet down on this most simple phone. I just want people to think I'm smart
02:20:26.76 --> 02:20:28.52 I'm like you know what I think I have enough
02:20:28.52 --> 02:20:32.20 To get to where I want to go if I go to UCLA
02:20:32.92 --> 02:20:40.12 So I would drive up to LA every weekend to go to school there and knock out my MBA and then from there you
02:20:41.08 --> 02:20:45.64 You want to invest my banking right? Yeah, yeah, so I knew that I you know like way
02:20:45.64 --> 02:20:48.76 What do you what do you do after an MBA like everybody does investment banking or
02:20:49.88 --> 02:20:51.88 Consulting and
02:20:51.88 --> 02:20:56.36 I always really liked finance and then my my buddy. I was so about cowboy
02:20:56.36 --> 02:21:00.84 I'm going to tell you we got exact same resumes like do I'm going to go be an investment banker?
02:21:00.84 --> 02:21:03.32 I'm like cool. I'm gonna go be an investment banker too
02:21:04.92 --> 02:21:09.56 So is he like a year ahead of years? No, we're in the same class, but he actually knew how to do it
02:21:09.56 --> 02:21:14.84 So he actually got in so there's a cycle to it and I didn't know that so when you first get to your MBA program
02:21:14.84 --> 02:21:17.80 Literally the second you step on campus you're already recruiting for it
02:21:18.04 --> 02:21:24.28 You're already recruiting for the the internship for that summer and then you go to your second year and after you graduate
02:21:24.28 --> 02:21:29.48 Second year you start full time however by a time I figured it all out. I was already at my second year
02:21:29.48 --> 02:21:31.48 So I was a year behind and
02:21:31.48 --> 02:21:34.68 So nobody really wanted to deal with me because it wasn't the traditional path
02:21:35.16 --> 02:21:42.12 So I just started reaching out to people on LinkedIn like sending them my resume and I would put in like whatever bank
02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.36 US like I would put Air Force Veteran Marine Corps Veteran
02:21:46.68 --> 02:21:49.16 I'm like dude if anybody's gonna answer me it's gonna be a veteran god
02:21:49.16 --> 02:21:55.24 And that's how I started getting in was a veteran from these banks they would start reaching out. You only saw my resume
02:21:55.24 --> 02:21:57.24 Like I think they were intrigued
02:21:57.80 --> 02:22:00.84 Obviously the Navy seal park kind of stands out. I'm not gonna lie
02:22:00.84 --> 02:22:03.24 I just that's definitely what got my foot in the door because
02:22:03.48 --> 02:22:06.92 Some of these other people it's an extremely competitive job and some of these people
02:22:07.64 --> 02:22:12.36 A waste martyr them me and be had like a legitimate pedigree in the finance world
02:22:13.64 --> 02:22:14.92 And so
02:22:14.92 --> 02:22:20.28 Meanwhile you were exo straight ahead. Yeah, so I told my wife. Good point man
02:22:20.84 --> 02:22:24.92 Yeah, yeah, I told my wife I'm like dude when I go to these meet and greets because it's like a million meet and greets
02:22:25.48 --> 02:22:28.68 Because it's extremely competitive. I'm telling it's it's so competitive
02:22:30.28 --> 02:22:34.60 And especially in LA because in LA there's a lot less slot like if you go in New York
02:22:34.60 --> 02:22:38.84 There's a ton of slots in your everybody wants to be a warm weather so everybody's like trying to apply to go to LA
02:22:39.96 --> 02:22:43.000 And I told my wife I'm like when I go to these meet and greets like all these people
02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000 They're just ridiculously smart
02:22:45.24 --> 02:22:52.28 How's it like it's pretty intimidating and then we had this one interview process where they actually take you in with your other competitors
02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:58.28 So it's like you and two other people that you're competing with and then you go and you interview with these bankers
02:22:58.28 --> 02:23:04.36 And these these interviews were like three hours long like you would do half an hour with this banker and then half an hour with this banker
02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:09.80 And that's when I realized that I belong there that I could that I had a shot
02:23:09.80 --> 02:23:15.48 Because the very first that that interview process wasn't technical at all. It was all about leadership
02:23:16.68 --> 02:23:20.60 So when they start coming up with these questions like tell me about a time
02:23:21.32 --> 02:23:27.08 Where this happened. I'm like cool. I have a story for that. I have a story for everything and
02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:35.40 It was cool because I would tell my story and then the guy next to me will tell his story and it literally got to the point
02:23:35.40 --> 02:23:41.88 Where I'm not in kidding you and in the interview the guy next to me was like I really hate going after him
02:23:42.60 --> 02:23:44.60 What am I supposed to say after that?
02:23:47.16 --> 02:23:52.60 So that's what I'm like oh I got a shot and you ended up getting hard. Yeah, I ended up getting the internship
02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:57.80 So the internships like you know nine weeks long. It's basically like a nine week interview
02:23:58.60 --> 02:24:04.68 It was legit like you're you're working your ass off grind. Yeah, it's a grind
02:24:04.68 --> 02:24:09.64 And then you had another year of school the complete no because I had actually started my second year
02:24:09.64 --> 02:24:17.72 It's so I so you got so your internship went right into job. Yeah, and that was actually one of the the the things were I
02:24:17.72 --> 02:24:21.88 Use you finish school when you're in which you finish school when you're in still in yeah
02:24:22.84 --> 02:24:25.56 And then when did you do that nine week internship did you leave
02:24:26.68 --> 02:24:29.40 Damn yeah, I was already on my way out. Yeah, it was like
02:24:29.40 --> 02:24:36.68 So like getting close to terminal even whenever exactly I said saved all my leaves specifically for for you know
02:24:36.68 --> 02:24:43.48 Me getting out got it and so I used it all well up then and I got hired and they let me start right away because
02:24:44.12 --> 02:24:46.12 You know I didn't have another year of school
02:24:46.52 --> 02:24:48.12 So
02:24:48.12 --> 02:24:52.44 And then retired and then how do you like how do you like the investment banking world?
02:24:52.44 --> 02:24:59.40 I like I liked a lot of it and I didn't like other parts of it
02:25:00.28 --> 02:25:02.04 I really liked the mergers and acquisitions
02:25:02.04 --> 02:25:08.12 So that's what we did we did mergers acquisitions and then leverage buyouts and we were dealing with big because I got hired with a big bold
02:25:08.12 --> 02:25:13.56 Bracket banks were working on like some big deals and it was exciting it was cool was interesting
02:25:14.28 --> 02:25:17.48 It just wasn't cool for 18 to 20 hours a day
02:25:17.48 --> 02:25:24.04 Like I worked long days it was like an early night was midnight
02:25:24.68 --> 02:25:29.24 But most of the times on you know I'm building power points and Excel models till three four in the morning
02:25:29.32 --> 02:25:35.48 Those times where I didn't sleep at all like our presentation was do it like 5 a.m. and I turned it in at 5 a.m
02:25:36.20 --> 02:25:42.12 Where were you working out of so home because it was pretty good yeah, so I didn't have to move up to LA
02:25:42.52 --> 02:25:44.52 Which is good because my wife didn't want to move up there
02:25:44.52 --> 02:25:47.88 But we were set on moving up there and but it was
02:25:49.40 --> 02:25:56.12 Every time we drove up there to look at places the drive home would be very quiet because we could just tell that neither of us wanted to move up there
02:25:57.16 --> 02:26:02.68 But it worked out for me because like I said it was COVID so they're like hey we're gonna be virtual you know for the time being
02:26:04.04 --> 02:26:05.40 And
02:26:05.40 --> 02:26:11.80 And I think when I realized like I don't want to do this long term is when I saw the managing directors have been there for a while like I would finish the presentation
02:26:11.80 --> 02:26:14.12 You know and it's like four in the morning like how you need to call them?
02:26:14.68 --> 02:26:17.32 I'm like it's four in the morning like you need to call a managing director
02:26:17.88 --> 02:26:22.36 To me T.S. to look over that PowerPoint for we turn it in and I'm like dang so I guess it's never stops
02:26:23.24 --> 02:26:27.08 And it was and I had to had a couple T.B. eyes throughout my career
02:26:27.88 --> 02:26:31.96 So my my green because I wasn't there was literally nice where I won't go sleep at all
02:26:32.28 --> 02:26:33.88 I'd roll right into the next day and and
02:26:34.12 --> 02:26:40.28 My greens were starting to get more frequent and staring at a screen like all day long and I'm like this isn't gonna be
02:26:40.28 --> 02:26:43.24 A long term play for me, but I'm gonna tough it out
02:26:45.32 --> 02:26:51.48 You know for the two or three years or whatever you gotta be to make VP and then move on some else and I didn't realize that the job offers
02:26:51.48 --> 02:26:53.48 We're gonna start rolling in so quickly
02:26:53.72 --> 02:26:58.84 So like once the job offers like recruiters started reaching out to me. I'm like I'm gonna start looking elsewhere
02:26:59.80 --> 02:27:04.68 And around that time is you know J.P. had been talking to me about echelon front now for
02:27:04.68 --> 02:27:11.64 For about a year like even when I was in trade-a he's like hey you thought about coming over here and and I was I was interested but I just never materialized
02:27:12.12 --> 02:27:13.32 You know
02:27:13.32 --> 02:27:19.000 And I just went down my path I told him. Hey J.P. this is actually what I'm doing now and I'm kind of all in on it and
02:27:20.04 --> 02:27:24.28 So it's around that time. I'm already looking at moving to different firms
02:27:24.28 --> 02:27:26.68 I've already got a couple that I'm pretty close to
02:27:26.84 --> 02:27:30.60 to signing with and and then J.P. calls me one day and he's like hey bro
02:27:30.60 --> 02:27:37.08 We have a client who you know about 50% of his employee speaks Spanish and I told him we could deliver
02:27:39.08 --> 02:27:41.08 I was like you did
02:27:41.08 --> 02:27:43.08 He's like well yeah I got you
02:27:43.08 --> 02:27:45.08 Because he knew I was fluent in Spanish and
02:27:45.72 --> 02:27:48.28 I was like bro you ever seen office space?
02:27:48.84 --> 02:27:51.56 I was like that's my life. I have seven bosses Bob
02:27:52.28 --> 02:27:55.96 You know so you're all I'm on seven different deals and for each deal. I have to get
02:27:56.52 --> 02:27:59.16 approved I mean they granted some of them are are you know
02:27:59.16 --> 02:28:03.88 have some spill over so there's a minute I'm working with you know managing director for two or three different deals
02:28:03.88 --> 02:28:08.84 So I'm like dude it's gonna be so hard for me to get a day off like it's gonna be near impossible
02:28:09.64 --> 02:28:11.32 And he's like bro I really need this
02:28:12.04 --> 02:28:13.88 I'm like all right you know
02:28:14.76 --> 02:28:18.68 And J.P. is one of my brothers like I love J.P. to death so I'm like let me see what I can do
02:28:19.24 --> 02:28:23.56 So I put in the time for two personal days and by the way a personal day
02:28:24.12 --> 02:28:27.96 It's funny when you get the email that says this is what a personal day looks like you will check your email
02:28:27.96 --> 02:28:31.48 You know like six times during that day and if you need something you will answer it so it's
02:28:31.88 --> 02:28:33.88 Really like a personal day so freaking working
02:28:34.76 --> 02:28:39.000 So I'm like I took two personal days to come out and help them out with this FTX and
02:28:40.76 --> 02:28:44.52 So I would literally you know teach all day long and then I pulled an all-nighter
02:28:44.68 --> 02:28:50.28 Trying to catch up on all the work that I missed throughout the day so I didn't sleep for like those three days that I was there
02:28:50.28 --> 02:28:58.36 Um, but it was cool because I showed up and it was this construction company and when I showed up
02:28:59.16 --> 02:29:04.92 I could tell that that some of the guys weren't happy to be there and not because they're you know lazy
02:29:04.92 --> 02:29:06.68 Anything that they just wanted to go to work
02:29:07.16 --> 02:29:11.72 They're hardworking people you know so they're like they want to be working instead of being in this
02:29:12.28 --> 02:29:14.28 Leadership course and
02:29:14.76 --> 02:29:17.16 So let's see I think I think it was a Thursday
02:29:17.16 --> 02:29:22.12 Yeah, I was a Thursday where the first day of class started and we split the class in two because they
02:29:22.12 --> 02:29:26.60 Had so many people that we were gonna teach one class one day and then the other group that's next day and on Saturday
02:29:26.60 --> 02:29:29.16 We did like a debrief tying it all back into their business
02:29:29.56 --> 02:29:34.04 So day one I'm teaching I could see it that you know they'd rather be working than be there
02:29:34.76 --> 02:29:38.44 One of their form and who you know it's like one of their rock star form and shows up late
02:29:39.24 --> 02:29:44.52 Like same thing. He's like man, I'd rather be working right now. You know, I'll be there and then at the end of the day
02:29:44.52 --> 02:29:49.88 I I noticed the switch like they I could tell that they were enjoying themselves and they
02:29:49.88 --> 02:29:55.80 They were learning stuff and it was clicking the light bulbs were coming on and at the end of the day this form and he comes on to me
02:29:55.80 --> 02:30:00.20 He's like hey man, I'm really sorry that I showed up late. Can I come back tomorrow and do it all over again?
02:30:00.68 --> 02:30:04.68 I was like it's fine with us as long as your boss is cool with it and he's like okay
02:30:05.32 --> 02:30:07.32 So he comes back the next day
02:30:07.32 --> 02:30:11.08 You know and and does the full day of training with echelon front and
02:30:11.08 --> 02:30:13.08 And
02:30:13.08 --> 02:30:15.08 on the third day
02:30:15.08 --> 02:30:17.08 when I
02:30:17.64 --> 02:30:22.84 Herd the debrief points and the impact that I made. I mean some of these debrief points there do it was like emotional
02:30:24.12 --> 02:30:29.000 Like it was like shit and I was like wow like you guys are doing something really great here
02:30:29.96 --> 02:30:31.96 Um, and I felt good about it
02:30:32.68 --> 02:30:34.28 You know their CEO was just
02:30:35.32 --> 02:30:39.64 Just cared so much it's super super intelligent guy very caring very humble
02:30:39.64 --> 02:30:46.36 And it was just a pleasure talking to him and and seeing how much he cared about his team and his people and then seeing
02:30:46.92 --> 02:30:52.28 How these other people appreciated now really start to appreciate the fact that he did this for them
02:30:52.28 --> 02:30:55.96 Like was trying to develop them as leaders because he cared about them. He cared about the company
02:30:57.24 --> 02:30:59.88 And I told J.P. I'm like man that felt good
02:31:01.32 --> 02:31:07.48 I haven't felt good about what I was doing for work for for a while since I left the teams and
02:31:07.48 --> 02:31:09.96 Um, and that's when I was like okay
02:31:10.60 --> 02:31:14.84 Let's have a serious conversation of what this could possibly look like for me joining EF
02:31:16.52 --> 02:31:18.76 So here you are you know that that little
02:31:19.88 --> 02:31:20.92 The little
02:31:20.92 --> 02:31:27.48 obstacle that you get over with and I obviously I've been doing this for a long time now
02:31:28.20 --> 02:31:33.24 But there's a little obstacle with some people when they show up for training and the obstacle is
02:31:33.24 --> 02:31:40.28 Well, there's there can be several of them but one of the biggest obstacles is they don't yet understand that
02:31:40.84 --> 02:31:42.84 Leadership is a skill
02:31:43.48 --> 02:31:49.24 And that it's something that they use and it's something that they can actually learn and get good at
02:31:49.64 --> 02:31:55.80 And it doesn't take very long in those sessions where people go oh wait that's me. Oh wait. I could use that
02:31:56.60 --> 02:31:58.60 And all of a sudden they realize
02:31:58.60 --> 02:32:05.80 This is gonna make my life so much better and it's gonna make my team's life so much better and that
02:32:06.28 --> 02:32:10.52 That is so gratifying to see that and what's really awesome is
02:32:11.32 --> 02:32:18.84 When you look up in three months six months or a year and now you see where that company is and they they're trajectory that
02:32:19.24 --> 02:32:23.08 That changes for a company and how they elevate and move forward
02:32:23.08 --> 02:32:30.20 Man, it's freaking it's very very rewarding to say the least yeah every time I do another job
02:32:30.20 --> 02:32:33.24 I'm just just solidifies that decision for sure
02:32:33.72 --> 02:32:35.72 It's weird where you thinking
02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:43.48 Because because the first gigs that you did was teaching FTX which is like our fuel training exercise which is
02:32:45.24 --> 02:32:51.000 You know, I'm JP and I've talked about this where I'm like a HAP people don't they don't need to really like know how to
02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:58.76 Clear room yeah, it's just it's funny almost the human instincts that you have of how you would clear a room are good enough
02:32:59.48 --> 02:33:05.000 To do the FTXs. It's not about teaching people how you know the tactics of combat
02:33:05.24 --> 02:33:08.84 It's just about teaching them leadership, but it's funny
02:33:09.56 --> 02:33:12.20 Even the plans they come up with like we give them a target
02:33:12.92 --> 02:33:16.76 Their plans are like perfectly fine. They're perfectly fine. Yeah, no
02:33:16.76 --> 02:33:22.04 Sometimes they're not that great sometimes they make mistakes, but a lot of times it's like, yeah, you know what that's that would work
02:33:22.04 --> 02:33:25.80 That would work on this target for real and these are people that are civilians because
02:33:26.60 --> 02:33:30.84 Let's face it hitting a target of bad guys. There's it's not rocket science
02:33:31.16 --> 02:33:35.48 It's not rocket science to figure out what you're gonna do and we give them enough basics that they can figure it out
02:33:35.80 --> 02:33:36.84 but
02:33:37.08 --> 02:33:38.04 For me
02:33:38.04 --> 02:33:43.72 You know the the leadership laboratory that we got to work in we were actually in and actually a trade it and actually seeing
02:33:43.72 --> 02:33:47.000 Patoons go through that is such a powerful thing because
02:33:47.72 --> 02:33:49.72 Man when you are in those situations
02:33:50.44 --> 02:33:55.72 You feel it and when you like you think all I'm good at detaching and then you go on a run where you're freaking
02:33:56.20 --> 02:33:58.84 Yellow and screaming and you you know and you're saying oh
02:33:59.08 --> 02:34:00.84 How was that detachment on the last run?
02:34:00.84 --> 02:34:06.28 Yeah, as you were yelling and screaming at everybody and shooting your weapon a bunch and not and no one took charge of anything
02:34:06.52 --> 02:34:08.12 So obvious
02:34:08.12 --> 02:34:12.68 When you actually experience it and you learn that lesson so much more thoroughly
02:34:12.68 --> 02:34:17.08 When you actually experience it's freaking awesome to watch. Yeah, absolutely
02:34:17.08 --> 02:34:20.60 I've had messages like on on Instagram or LinkedIn
02:34:21.48 --> 02:34:23.08 Where people have gone through our training
02:34:23.08 --> 02:34:28.12 It's like hey, I had this situation at work and I thought about that time when you took the gun away from me and told me to lead
02:34:28.36 --> 02:34:31.32 You know because when they're not detached and they're just getting after it with their gun
02:34:31.32 --> 02:34:34.92 But they're actually in charge like every now and then I'll take their gun away
02:34:35.32 --> 02:34:40.04 Like hey lead now you can lead you know how they're gun and and so you know
02:34:40.04 --> 02:34:46.28 They'll right back like I remember the time you did this to me or you said this to me and and I say that at at that FTX is on my K
02:34:46.68 --> 02:34:47.96 You know
02:34:47.96 --> 02:34:49.96 Going through that pain
02:34:50.68 --> 02:34:56.60 Actually solidifies that lesson way more and it's like Bruce Lee says the pain will leave you when it's done teaching you
02:34:57.48 --> 02:34:59.48 One of my favorite quotes
02:34:59.48 --> 02:35:03.64 And I tell people that too like in my brief in the morning on my hate. We're not here to teach you leadership
02:35:03.64 --> 02:35:08.20 I mean, we're not here to teach you tactics. We're here to teach you leadership and in the absence of knowledge
02:35:08.20 --> 02:35:11.80 Because you don't have any you know knowledge doing this. What do you have to lean back on your leadership?
02:35:11.80 --> 02:35:16.28 Which is simply you trying to influence another 25 people towards a common goal
02:35:16.92 --> 02:35:25.40 So you're gonna have to use all those tools that we've you know talked about and the the groups that do the best or the ones that are able to apply it immediately like they make that
02:35:25.56 --> 02:35:29.16 Connection and the ones that struggle are the ones that that you know
02:35:30.12 --> 02:35:33.16 Can't seem to do that. You know what's interesting. I was just thinking about this
02:35:33.16 --> 02:35:40.12 From a GG to perspective how long you've been training GG for since 2012. I know lots of off
02:35:41.64 --> 02:35:49.40 So so what's interesting is you know people like you take a normal dude and you say hey what did that doesn't train
02:35:49.96 --> 02:35:55.48 And you think hey if you get in a fight what would you do they kind of like they kind of think what is it that the hey?
02:35:55.72 --> 02:35:57.72 I just see red bro
02:35:57.72 --> 02:36:02.04 You know I go off bro like that's kind of what they think they think that that is
02:36:02.04 --> 02:36:07.000 How they're gonna fight and that's how they would win in a fight like hey. I'll just freaking make it happen
02:36:08.04 --> 02:36:14.44 And that's totally ignorant that's one of the most ignorant things you could say and if you go against someone that's trained then you're absolutely gonna lose
02:36:14.44 --> 02:36:16.44 But there's also a really good chance to lose anyways
02:36:17.72 --> 02:36:24.92 Imagine this there's people that that are in leadership positions that their mentality is that exact same thing
02:36:24.92 --> 02:36:30.04 Hey, oh if I'm in charge of tell people to all handle it and and they could literally learn
02:36:30.04 --> 02:36:35.64 Judges who for leadership we have jujitsu for leadership it's like an amazing
02:36:36.36 --> 02:36:43.08 Untapped knowledge that like the graces the graces brought you to the world and all of a sudden people like oh
02:36:43.08 --> 02:36:46.12 I can choke people I don't I can defeat to someone that's bigger than me
02:36:46.36 --> 02:36:51.72 I can avoid getting hit like there's all these amazing things that we literally did not know as humans
02:36:52.04 --> 02:36:56.12 We did not know and if you were to go out and a fight and if I would have gotten no fight in
02:36:56.12 --> 02:37:00.36 in 1990 or 1991 I
02:37:00.92 --> 02:37:10.60 Would do what my instincts are throw haymakers whatever like whatever it is a human is gonna do is what I would do and then all of a sudden as soon as I learn
02:37:10.60 --> 02:37:12.60 Oh the joke
02:37:12.60 --> 02:37:19.32 Like all of a sudden you know what to do and now you can handle all these situations and it's the same thing with what we teach it's like oh
02:37:19.48 --> 02:37:20.84 This isn't some
02:37:20.84 --> 02:37:26.84 This isn't some mysterious thing like here. Oh, this is an arm walk it's called cover-in move here's
02:37:27.24 --> 02:37:35.24 Taking the back this is keeping things simple you can actually learn maneuvers for leadership and that's what hits people when they're
02:37:35.56 --> 02:37:38.92 Going through our programs you can see it in the face they're like oh
02:37:39.64 --> 02:37:45.32 I remember when a guy was doing this to me and all I had to do back was was
02:37:45.32 --> 02:37:51.16 To manage you know how to meet reflect and diminish I could have taken that angry person and
02:37:52.68 --> 02:37:57.88 Reflected some of those emotions but diminish them and then I could reflect it in such a way that they would
02:37:57.96 --> 02:38:01.48 Realize that I'm on their side and then we'd be able to have a real conversation to move this important
02:38:01.64 --> 02:38:03.000 That's one move
02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:09.32 There's all these moves you can learn and man. It's just like this. You know what it's actually the same look when somebody does
02:38:09.32 --> 02:38:14.68 You jits you and whatever moment because different people get it at different time that moment where they go oh
02:38:15.32 --> 02:38:20.28 This is amazing like oh it all makes sense. I think it's sometimes when people realize that
02:38:21.32 --> 02:38:26.04 You know oh and then you sweep them and you're in the mountain and they go oh
02:38:26.20 --> 02:38:30.28 It all connected you see that look in the rise and I see that look in the eyes
02:38:30.28 --> 02:38:33.16 That's what you're talking about like the guy that you're talking about that came back the end of the day like
02:38:33.24 --> 02:38:34.76 Hey, can I come tomorrow?
02:38:34.76 --> 02:38:41.96 Because he realized that it's all connected that leadership is a skill that he could actually utilize these tools to go out there and
02:38:42.52 --> 02:38:48.28 Lead his team with with skills and with techniques and with procedures moves
02:38:49.08 --> 02:38:51.48 Man, it's freaking empowering
02:38:52.52 --> 02:38:53.72 legit
02:38:53.72 --> 02:38:55.08 Um
02:38:55.08 --> 02:38:58.28 And that's where you're at right now. Yeah, we just went through your whole damn life bro
02:38:58.28 --> 02:39:06.44 Yep, that that's pretty impressive. We'll have to uh, I know there's a I know you had some some stuff that you wrote down for me
02:39:06.44 --> 02:39:12.20 That we didn't cover today that we'll probably cover cover on the next time as didn't you know get a little bit more granular
02:39:12.20 --> 02:39:14.20 And some of these things that you experience for sure
02:39:14.76 --> 02:39:17.24 But probably a pretty good place to wrap it up
02:39:17.96 --> 02:39:23.24 Of course echo probably has some questions at this point. Oh, you got what a question oh, yeah, keep it simple
02:39:23.80 --> 02:39:26.28 Have you ever heard that you look like Oscar Delahoya?
02:39:26.28 --> 02:39:28.76 Every day of my life since I was 16
02:39:30.04 --> 02:39:35.16 As a matter of fact and my platoon's they already knew it was coming and so when we would go out
02:39:35.72 --> 02:39:39.24 Like you know people would be like hey is that and they're like you
02:39:39.80 --> 02:39:43.32 Yeah, we're security yeah, that's what they would say and
02:39:44.20 --> 02:39:49.000 Just not not too long goes in New York and I was with my wife and this guy comes out to me
02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.64 He's like hey man, I still think pound for pound you're the best
02:39:51.64 --> 02:39:57.40 And then she's like are you gonna correct him and I'm like I'm tired of correcting people but then it's like more people
02:39:57.40 --> 02:39:59.16 Start coming up like hey guys. I'm not Oscar
02:39:59.72 --> 02:40:01.72 The buff version
02:40:01.72 --> 02:40:06.76 Scrilla was jacked version the jack version. I've gotten that forever
02:40:07.48 --> 02:40:09.48 Yeah, that is an uncanny resemblance
02:40:10.44 --> 02:40:13.80 All right, yeah, who do you look like echo Charles? Jade?
02:40:14.92 --> 02:40:18.76 Too easy though you even asked that one before that was too easy
02:40:19.24 --> 02:40:21.08 Got that twin brother. Oh, yeah
02:40:21.08 --> 02:40:24.60 Man like I said we'll dig into some more of this stuff in the future probably could place a wrap it today
02:40:26.92 --> 02:40:33.40 That goes Charles yes sir sounds like it kind of seems like Carlos has gotten a lot done
02:40:34.28 --> 02:40:39.88 Yes, he has I'm thinking maybe we should all do more what do you think what do we start?
02:40:40.28 --> 02:40:44.28 Well, you mentioned you get to what a good place to start. Yes, sir
02:40:45.16 --> 02:40:48.12 Yeah, we want to what do you a purple belt yeah purple belt
02:40:48.12 --> 02:40:55.24 2012 it's 21.9 year when do you get a purple? just recently yeah, but often on that's yeah
02:40:55.24 --> 02:40:59.24 I was on deployment a lot and and then I would bounce around a couple of schools and
02:40:59.88 --> 02:41:03.24 I'm training actually with your buddy Aaron Hernandez. Oh, right on to he's awesome

02:41:26.04 --> 02:41:28.04 Yeah, almost against their will
02:41:28.04 --> 02:41:32.36 It didn't seem like Aaron's dad was into it, but he's like oh, this is what my kid wants to cool
02:41:32.36 --> 02:41:37.56 I'm gonna sit here every day, you know for two hours on the bench waiting for my kid to get done with this

02:41:49.32 --> 02:41:53.40 Improble that happens yeah, so yeah, even life was like that too, right?
02:41:53.56 --> 02:41:57.32 Dude, life was a white belt, but I started training
02:41:58.04 --> 02:42:03.000 Those guys in 2005, but actually he had trained before that
02:42:03.56 --> 02:42:05.56 Lafet trained at Fabios
02:42:06.12 --> 02:42:11.84 Before 2005 so life was like white belt for I mean
02:42:11.84 --> 02:42:14.48 Yeah, I was like you should say no, I
02:42:15.76 --> 02:42:19.44 Long time long time long time. That was perfectly happy at blue belt
02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:25.76 Yeah, Aaron was like bro. I got he got it. You got it. Do it to you. Yeah, blue belt is the
02:42:26.40 --> 02:42:30.88 Blue belt is the last chance you have to be under the radar. Yeah, because once you're a purple belt
02:42:30.88 --> 02:42:33.52 But people expect you there's a yeah you
02:42:34.40 --> 02:42:39.52 You can get tapped you can literally get tapped by a white belt as a blue belt and it's not that big of a deal right
02:42:39.52 --> 02:42:44.48 You're kind of like well, you know, I'm just a blue belt just to blue belt it covers a lot of ground
02:42:44.56 --> 02:42:46.56 I was a blue belt for a long time too
02:42:46.56 --> 02:42:48.32 I was a blue belt because I was a blue belt
02:42:48.32 --> 02:42:52.80 I got my blue belt and San Diego, but then I moved to Virginia Beach and I mean dude, and I was training
02:42:53.36 --> 02:42:56.16 When I was in San Diego training all the time and then when I got to Virginia Beach
02:42:56.16 --> 02:42:58.72 I did a couple of appointments so I wasn't training that's much but even I was on deployment
02:42:58.72 --> 02:43:00.16 I would train with the boys
02:43:01.04 --> 02:43:04.80 But I was still a blue belt so it was years. I think I was a blue belt for like I
02:43:05.20 --> 02:43:08.08 Wanted and then when I got back to San Diego
02:43:08.08 --> 02:43:11.28 So, you know, I had to like re-earn my
02:43:12.24 --> 02:43:16.88 Risp it was like I it was like when I wasn't at Fabios he's I wasn't training
02:43:17.12 --> 02:43:20.88 He's like whatever and I'm the way you were you might have gotten better, but it didn't count
02:43:21.44 --> 02:43:24.24 We're starting where you left off. Yeah, we started where I left off with him
02:43:25.60 --> 02:43:27.60 So it took me another
02:43:27.92 --> 02:43:31.60 Another probably I think I was a blue belt like five years
02:43:32.80 --> 02:43:34.80 Blue belt and I
02:43:34.80 --> 02:43:39.04 I never buy my wife anything like hardly ever poor woman
02:43:39.68 --> 02:43:42.24 But when I got my purple belt when I got my purple belt
02:43:42.64 --> 02:43:45.92 I got up I went to a flower store. I got a purple flower
02:43:46.56 --> 02:43:52.56 Of some kind or like five purple flowers and brodma that's I was so stoked that I wanted my wife to be
02:43:52.56 --> 02:43:57.92 Got a stoked to get that purple belt but and and I was ready for it too like I mean
02:43:58.72 --> 02:44:00.96 When I got my purple balls ready for that purple belt
02:44:00.96 --> 02:44:04.96 I had somebody got their black belt the other day friend of mine got a black belt the other day
02:44:05.04 --> 02:44:09.92 He's not ready for it. I was like no one feels like they're ready for their black belt no almost no one right?
02:44:09.92 --> 02:44:11.92 Maybe you just won worlds or whatever
02:44:12.96 --> 02:44:16.64 But you're not just like oh yeah, I forget who it was. I think might have been Clark
02:44:17.52 --> 02:44:20.08 greasy I think I could be wrong so whenever
02:44:20.80 --> 02:44:25.92 But it was a kind of where he was winning everything as a brown belt everything and
02:44:26.48 --> 02:44:30.32 I think he was like I don't know if it was a coach or whatever someone was kind of like oh
02:44:30.32 --> 02:44:34.56 Wait is he doing that just so he can win a bunch and
02:44:34.96 --> 02:44:40.08 Someone was like bro like he can't compete as a brown belt anymore. It's like someone has to give it
02:44:40.08 --> 02:44:45.76 Black belt like that's that's the only exception I could ever think of yeah well Dean list one ADCC is a brown belt
02:44:46.64 --> 02:44:51.68 Yeah, yeah, yeah, but via submission by the way absolutely by the way
02:44:51.68 --> 02:44:59.76 I'm doing so so we're thinking to Jets is good. Yes, it Jets is good fitness is good Carlos in great shape
02:45:00.32 --> 02:45:06.80 You know, no, it's good to see if so we got some healthy how should I say healthy we want to go in a healthy direction
02:45:06.96 --> 02:45:10.80 Mentally physically same so I'm gonna talk about energy drinks first
02:45:11.44 --> 02:45:12.64 Cuz that's you know
02:45:12.64 --> 02:45:17.84 Kind of what we do from time to time so we got jocco discipline go energy drink healthy energy drink
02:45:17.84 --> 02:45:22.56 By the way, if you didn't know Carlos and did those things power the FTXs. I know
02:45:25.60 --> 02:45:30.80 Like a soft ball what he called rhetorical kind of question because I know I know you know, but the the the the
02:45:30.80 --> 02:45:32.80 Discipline goes scenarios
02:45:32.80 --> 02:45:39.84 So yes, so yeah, we will drink energy drinks though as long as this kind yeah, yeah for sure because the other kind
02:45:40.64 --> 02:45:41.84 Bad is bad
02:45:41.84 --> 02:45:44.96 It's it's a dichotomy well this kind
02:45:44.96 --> 02:45:49.20 Completely bad for you legitimately bad for you and this isn't like oh well
02:45:49.60 --> 02:45:54.32 Jocco's trying to sell his energy drink no, I'm telling you those other energyings are
02:45:54.96 --> 02:46:02.000 factually bad for you. We have one that is factually good for you. Yes, sir. Factually you know that there's a
02:46:02.56 --> 02:46:04.40 I don't know the service but you can do it online
02:46:04.40 --> 02:46:12.48 I was gonna do it for a video. I was gonna make long time ago before all this where you can make your own energy drink like if you want oh
02:46:12.48 --> 02:46:19.52 You know Carlos extra thunder energy drink or whatever and you can kind of pick a flavor and then like
02:46:20.08 --> 02:46:23.44 They'll design the thing or you could design the thing and then you just get it
02:46:23.44 --> 02:46:27.28 But it's all like the similar like if you want cherry blast or whatever
02:46:27.28 --> 02:46:32.96 I don't know what you call it, but if you get like a cherry flavored one it's like the same cherry flavored as like you know
02:46:33.20 --> 02:46:35.20 Jocco cherry blast
02:46:35.20 --> 02:46:37.20 I would do lemon lime lows
02:46:38.40 --> 02:46:39.36 You know it's interesting
02:46:39.36 --> 02:46:46.16 You might think yourself good because you did the investment banking thing for a while and did you guys take any companies public
02:46:46.64 --> 02:46:48.64 You so actually during my internship
02:46:48.64 --> 02:46:54.16 I don't like you it's interesting because we work with a bunch of public companies obviously
02:46:54.72 --> 02:46:59.04 But you might think to yourself like hey, well, why does everyone just make you know a
02:46:59.04 --> 02:47:02.16 Guad energy drink that's good for you. You think that right like hey
02:47:02.16 --> 02:47:04.16 Well, that just seems like that seems like a good idea
02:47:05.20 --> 02:47:06.96 And here's the deal
02:47:06.96 --> 02:47:08.96 It's more expensive
02:47:08.96 --> 02:47:15.92 It's more expensive and it's gonna cut into your profit and as soon as you get into a point in a company where you're like oh
02:47:17.60 --> 02:47:23.36 We want to do the right thing and make the best product and we are not gonna make as much money
02:47:23.60 --> 02:47:25.60 There's like
02:47:25.60 --> 02:47:33.76 armies of people that tear you apart and say no just freaking make more money. It's the same thing with you know with our hard goods with our clothing
02:47:33.76 --> 02:47:38.56 Yeah, as soon as you get to a point oh you where you can make jeans. Oh, we're making jeans
02:47:39.44 --> 02:47:41.20 As soon as some of those hey we could shave
02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:48.72 48 cents off the price per pair of those jeans. Oh, yeah, there's an army of people that say do it
02:47:49.12 --> 02:47:53.28 They sell they say sell your soul. That's what they say and it works
02:47:53.28 --> 02:47:58.32 Of course it I mean it works think about it too. Especially the more you sell right where okay
02:47:58.32 --> 02:48:04.40 I'm gonna do this. Oh, we're gonna shave 48 cents when you're selling like 10 pair or 10 whatever it's like 40 cents
02:48:04.40 --> 02:48:06.08 It's like what four dollars in front
02:48:06.40 --> 02:48:12.32 I'd rather keep my hand bigger. Yeah, but once the numbers start going way up there in 48 cents means like another like
02:48:12.32 --> 02:48:14.96 I don't know half a million dollars for you or whatever
02:48:14.96 --> 02:48:16.96 Yeah, oh, I think that 48 cents
02:48:16.96 --> 02:48:25.60 You know so it's a literal selling of the soul literal selling of the soul man because like this is pasteurized right
02:48:25.60 --> 02:48:31.92 Which means we not to put chemicals in it which by the way this is chemicals that everybody uses they all throw them in there
02:48:31.92 --> 02:48:37.76 Hey, there's not that bad right right it's not that bad. Yeah. Yeah. Sell yourself. We'll say industry standard
02:48:37.76 --> 02:48:40.48 Yeah, it's the industry standard. You kind of shred your shoulders
02:48:40.48 --> 02:48:45.92 But well, you know, that's the way everyone's doing it. Well, there's certain like toxins right where like the FDA is like well
02:48:45.92 --> 02:48:47.92 You just keep them below this level and
02:48:48.56 --> 02:48:50.96 Technically it's like it's legal or whatever
02:48:50.96 --> 02:48:52.96 It's like consider not
02:48:52.96 --> 02:48:56.72 harmful whatever or if they pound like three of those every day
02:48:57.04 --> 02:48:59.04 That's crazy big trouble
02:48:59.04 --> 02:49:06.96 Big trouble now the last now with these obviously it's good. So yeah get on some of that that'll help us you know move you in the right direction
02:49:06.96 --> 02:49:12.000 Yes, sir stay fit and mentally because the cognitive stuff and there as well also
02:49:12.88 --> 02:49:18.000 Keep your joints in in the game as well, you know if you still if you want to work out as you get older
02:49:18.88 --> 02:49:20.56 You don't you love staying
02:49:20.56 --> 02:49:24.72 No, do you live today I did yeah, well time you live what time do you
02:49:24.72 --> 02:49:25.68 We're good
02:49:25.68 --> 02:49:26.72 It's not 430
02:49:27.28 --> 02:49:29.04 It's I saw today I got up at 6
02:49:29.76 --> 02:49:31.76 What'd you do
02:49:31.76 --> 02:49:36.24 Just like don't not do but like roughly what'd you do pull ups do you what'd you do
02:49:36.24 --> 02:49:38.000 Tuesdays like day. Yeah me too
02:49:38.40 --> 02:49:40.40 Let me just happen to be this is a Sunday
02:49:40.40 --> 02:49:43.44 Yeah, but here's what's cool. I got done. I was just
02:49:44.16 --> 02:49:48.72 But my son opened the door to my garage and I could you know feel his presence there
02:49:48.72 --> 02:49:54.48 And only he's wanted to jacksteel himself and I racked away squats
02:49:55.04 --> 02:50:00.32 Racked away turn around and he goes how many more you got and I go I'm done because I was literally done and he goes
02:50:00.72 --> 02:50:02.72 Ways are good at the pier and I go
02:50:02.72 --> 02:50:04.72 Let's hit it
02:50:04.72 --> 02:50:10.32 Is it cold right now kind of cold it's California it's California meaning it's not gonna freeze
02:50:10.56 --> 02:50:14.56 But it's not gonna be warm either are we using a wet suit? I used the wetsuit today
02:50:14.56 --> 02:50:20.16 A warm weakness weakness no no efficiency look do you want to enjoy surfing you know what enjoy surfing
02:50:21.04 --> 02:50:25.20 You know the weird thing is frankly if you go surfing without a wetsuit
02:50:25.28 --> 02:50:27.28 It's only cold for the first
02:50:27.28 --> 02:50:33.68 Most days I mean if sure that's freezing but most days it's only cold for three minutes and then it's just normal and you feel fine
02:50:34.08 --> 02:50:35.68 Those three minutes though
02:50:35.68 --> 02:50:38.64 That's what puts feet that's what has people squeezing in that damn wetsuit
02:50:38.64 --> 02:50:44.24 Yeah, and also when you're in the cold water they like your handle and maybe for
02:50:45.12 --> 02:50:51.92 Like an eye me they depends who you are obviously but after like an hour it's almost like the coldness like you get hit with that initial coldness and your body's like
02:50:51.92 --> 02:50:55.20 I'm not that cold actually so we're cool plus you're generating heat from all the stuff
02:50:55.20 --> 02:51:00.88 But then the coldness kind of on a strategic level starts to just see pin yeah, and it kind of hits and you like probably I'm kind of this
02:51:01.44 --> 02:51:07.20 It's kind of what is it big factor you surf crows now? I don't here's a big factor if you're gonna be catching a lot of waves
02:51:07.20 --> 02:51:09.60 And there's good waves coming in you're gonna be fine
02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:14.32 But if it's one of those days we're gonna be waiting and there's a little brisk breeze at your back
02:51:14.72 --> 02:51:16.72 You're gonna get chilly woo
02:51:18.08 --> 02:51:22.40 You're gonna get chilly woo factors with that because one you're not having fun
02:51:22.40 --> 02:51:26.80 You know like well, you do it like you actually don't even notice a lot of stuff when you're having like fun
02:51:26.80 --> 02:51:31.20 You don't notice how tired you're getting you don't know that notice a lot of stuff colds probably one of those when you're you know
02:51:31.20 --> 02:51:38.40 And then you're moving way less yeah, and then you're just sitting there just being cold. Yes, there's there be cold
02:51:38.40 --> 02:51:41.60 There there's a let's face it. That's kind of legit
02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000 You know when I when I see someone scanning it
02:51:44.72 --> 02:51:48.24 Like props you get into I'm giving you props if you're scanning it you're getting props
02:51:48.24 --> 02:51:52.96 Maybe it's the dead of summer, but any other time if it's not
02:51:53.68 --> 02:51:57.76 If it's not all-guest and you're scanning it
02:51:57.76 --> 02:52:03.36 I give you a little bit of a little bit of and it's sometimes myself too. Yeah, you know what we're gonna do it
02:52:04.08 --> 02:52:06.08 Let's skin
02:52:06.08 --> 02:52:11.20 Because when you go through buds did you have wet suits that had like legs connected to him when you went through buds?
02:52:12.64 --> 02:52:16.96 No, I don't think so we just had shorties oh no, I have like beaver tail
02:52:17.36 --> 02:52:21.44 Oh, so that's what we had at first recon bat time okay for tails so when I got the buds
02:52:21.44 --> 02:52:25.28 I'm like they think of these students better what's it to be caught at what's beaver tail
02:52:25.28 --> 02:52:33.92 It's like you're the back of the wet suit has like a long tail on it and it comes up underneath your crotch and like snaps into position
02:52:34.24 --> 02:52:39.84 And fun of you it does nothing to hold in any water at all. It's the dumbest invention ever
02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:44.80 Whoever invented the beaver tail is an idiot you would never come up with that plan right?
02:52:45.68 --> 02:52:52.64 So because but now they have where the the the shirt of the wet suit is connected to the trunk
02:52:52.64 --> 02:52:58.16 Which is a whole different ballgame this is a whole different ballgame. This is a totally different situation
02:52:58.16 --> 02:53:01.44 And they get that in buds by the way you got that in buds
02:53:02.32 --> 02:53:04.80 I don't think I've ever worn a wet suit ever
02:53:05.36 --> 02:53:07.36 I can't remember one single time
02:53:08.08 --> 02:53:10.08 That's the way it is no light
02:53:11.36 --> 02:53:13.36 Shredding
02:53:13.76 --> 02:53:15.36 Anyway, back to our joints
02:53:15.92 --> 02:53:19.28 We don't we don't want to have joint problems. That's another thing cold lot is good for you
02:53:19.28 --> 02:53:26.24 And it's by the way that's where you got to get in that bath yeah, but if you're not gonna jump in ice bath as often as maybe you could
02:53:26.32 --> 02:53:31.44 You just keep the what's called joint warfare super krill oil supple me just take this up on it
02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.96 So you don't easy way so you don't got to freeze yourself vitamin D
02:53:36.24 --> 02:53:41.60 Take vitamin D 100% take that every day. Yeah, my god cold war
02:53:42.56 --> 02:53:44.56 Keep the immunity strong
02:53:44.56 --> 02:53:50.56 You get all this stuff from jockelfuel.com get some milk to because let's face it man
02:53:51.60 --> 02:53:54.72 Let's face it that's a tough one. It's a tough one to not
02:53:55.20 --> 02:53:58.88 Bro, did you see that did you I posted some stakes I had the other day. Yes, I saw that
02:53:59.68 --> 02:54:03.44 That's amazing. Yeah people people semi stakes
02:54:04.40 --> 02:54:10.48 Which is like the only like yeah people semi stakes those were from they were you know jack on them

02:54:29.04 --> 02:54:33.60 Even when I got done eating those even when I got done eating a freaking full on
02:54:33.60 --> 02:54:40.48 Tomahawk steak. I was like cool guess what I wanted a little bit of sweetness
02:54:41.04 --> 02:54:43.36 Goodness a little bit what's that other word?
02:54:44.80 --> 02:54:46.16 It's like
02:54:46.16 --> 02:54:51.12 Savory Savory is like steak, right? Yeah, like saltier with it right and then sweet
02:54:51.76 --> 02:54:53.76 What's mok it's got both

02:55:03.20 --> 02:55:08.72 Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then if you think about it like the good like savory has a little bit of sweet too
02:55:08.72 --> 02:55:13.92 And you think about it so what about mok basically it's hot mok season by the way
02:55:13.92 --> 02:55:18.32 It's like there's having a hot mok in the morning
02:55:18.32 --> 02:55:24.88 Oh, man. I'm not talking early morning like pre workout. I'm talking nine o'clock in the morning
02:55:25.52 --> 02:55:30.64 Starting to feel a little bit of hunger. It's a little bit cool outside hot mok coming at you live
02:55:31.36 --> 02:55:34.24 Do I throw whipped cream on top of that I do
02:55:35.76 --> 02:55:40.56 That's still pale. Oh, well, yeah, actually a lot of whipped cream well, I don't know a lot
02:55:40.56 --> 02:55:45.20 But the one that my wife buys is actually not that bad for it. It's actually pretty solid
02:55:45.20 --> 02:55:47.92 I'm surprised by that keep it a real with that keto
02:55:49.92 --> 02:55:53.36 Check the gizelle's a mok too. That's clean protein though by the way
02:55:53.36 --> 02:55:58.64 We don't really mention that because it like sometimes we're back in the day or whenever you didn't take mok
02:55:58.64 --> 02:56:00.16 You take protein shake you got the
02:56:00.72 --> 02:56:06.32 Let's face it like you get some secondary effects. You know from that not the kind this facts you weren't negative
02:56:07.76 --> 02:56:09.28 But that's not like that anymore
02:56:09.28 --> 02:56:13.76 But yeah, is that and then also jocquate tea the old school feel like tea hot tea now obviously
02:56:13.76 --> 02:56:17.52 And if you like dead left thing by the way. Yeah, sir. You don't want that job. It's the one
02:56:18.24 --> 02:56:22.72 Yeah, get it all at jockelfuel.com also the energy drink you already said
02:56:22.72 --> 02:56:26.72 Right by the way, I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about this or not yet, but we got
02:56:27.68 --> 02:56:31.92 We got some ready to drink mok coming oh yeah, and
02:56:32.96 --> 02:56:34.96 Let's just say
02:56:34.96 --> 02:56:41.36 I'm not saying that the creators that the creators deserve a Nobel Prize
02:56:41.36 --> 02:56:47.28 I'm not saying that it's definite, but they should be in the content should they should be mentioned there should be a mentioned
02:56:47.84 --> 02:56:49.84 When you try these things
02:56:49.84 --> 02:56:52.24 Yeah, so you're gonna be able to in the future
02:56:52.56 --> 02:56:59.52 Going to a wall-wop boom go restrate and just get mok on tap or like and actually that makes sense when you think about it because it's not like
02:57:00.08 --> 02:57:02.96 When you think about what if you spend anytime thinking about it
02:57:04.24 --> 02:57:09.04 Maybe I do maybe I don't I don't know but either way it's like you can't just because mok is the powder right
02:57:09.04 --> 02:57:16.80 Then you have your mix like you know we'll put in the banana we'll put in the whatever right and it's like this variations of mixes and variations of results
02:57:16.96 --> 02:57:18.32 And it makes sense
02:57:18.32 --> 02:57:23.70 So it's like hey if you're gonna drink the ready to drink one you got to commit to a very specific mix across the board
02:57:23.70 --> 02:57:26.96 Yeah, per flavor. You seem saying so now you got to rely on whoever
02:57:27.52 --> 02:57:33.52 Expert I know there in expert. I'll tell you that you ever had something coming to your life that you just just came out of nowhere
02:57:34.48 --> 02:57:37.52 Like you couldn't have predicted it. Oh, yeah, let me tell you something

03:09:38.72 --> 03:09:41.68 In real life no way but it's like just like yes
03:09:41.68 --> 03:09:46.16 Yeah, exactly right where it's like the Navy see like all the combat stuff
03:09:46.16 --> 03:09:50.48 That's just the example essentially it's just an example of these principles like
03:09:51.28 --> 03:09:53.28 Being used in these like
03:09:53.28 --> 03:09:56.96 situations or whatever but and since they they are useful and everything
03:09:57.60 --> 03:10:03.92 If you look at it in the sense of word this is they're talking to me for my specific situation and using the
03:10:03.92 --> 03:10:08.48 The battlefield doesn't matter for for sure, but they're talking to me for me for my specific situation
03:10:08.48 --> 03:10:13.92 It's like oh shoot everything checks out. Yeah, and as you read things from different perspectives
03:10:13.92 --> 03:10:17.92 Like yeah, you can read it from a professional perspective like you did the first time Carlos
03:10:18.56 --> 03:10:22.32 Then you read it from a person perspective the next time but then guess what happens you get promoted
03:10:23.20 --> 03:10:25.60 Read it again. You see it from another perspective again
03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:30.48 Then you have a problem what you get moved to a new team and everything's a dynamic are different
03:10:30.48 --> 03:10:35.76 Read it again. It's a you will have a different perspective and you will pick up more things from those books
03:10:36.48 --> 03:10:37.84 Also
03:10:37.84 --> 03:10:44.80 We have a leadership consultancy. We were just talking about national on front. National on front dot com if you want to do any of the things that we talk about on this podcast
03:10:44.80 --> 03:10:49.04 If you want to learn to the information go to national on front dot com. So what we do we
03:10:50.32 --> 03:10:53.52 Do look we do the FTX that's one part of it. We also do
03:10:54.40 --> 03:10:58.72 Leadership training that's not experiential so you're gonna sit down learn with us
03:10:58.72 --> 03:11:04.64 But we'll still make it dynamic through role playing and other other methodologies that we have so
03:11:04.64 --> 03:11:10.24 If you want to check some of that out go to national on front dot com. You haven't found there Carlos. Oh, yeah
03:11:11.12 --> 03:11:17.44 It's awesome. I mean the people that you meet are just amazing as well because I mean people that call for extreme ownership are not
03:11:17.92 --> 03:11:19.20 lazy people
03:11:19.20 --> 03:11:22.96 People who just want to take it to the next level so I honestly have a meta client yet that I just
03:11:23.60 --> 03:11:28.000 Didn't really like and I bet it's awesome because you keep in touch with them like they hit you up every now and then and
03:11:28.80 --> 03:11:30.80 They come to your friends
03:11:30.80 --> 03:11:36.56 For sure I get text all the times I get text from that are like hey, we just did this it's awesome
03:11:36.56 --> 03:11:40.64 I'll also get text like hey can I talk to you and they'll have some situation going on and it's like all right
03:11:40.64 --> 03:11:44.72 What do you got? What do you got? Let's work through this hey we also have an online
03:11:45.44 --> 03:11:47.44 training academy and
03:11:48.24 --> 03:11:52.56 There's a bunch of reasons why we started that the biggest reason why we started is because
03:11:53.28 --> 03:11:55.28 like I was saying earlier about
03:11:55.28 --> 03:12:01.04 Juditsu and actually having a skill and getting good at this thing called leadership
03:12:02.64 --> 03:12:06.48 Well just like you jitsu you can't go to one class and be like, oh, okay cool. I'm good now
03:12:06.48 --> 03:12:10.80 I know it no it takes repetition it takes understanding the various angles
03:12:11.12 --> 03:12:17.84 It takes expanded knowledge it takes confronting different scenarios multiple times so you understand how to understand them
03:12:19.68 --> 03:12:22.88 You've heard to understand how to understand them
03:12:22.88 --> 03:12:25.84 Imagine that you're looking at a situation
03:12:26.96 --> 03:12:31.84 You don't know what to do you can actually understand how to understand that
03:12:32.88 --> 03:12:38.16 So this doesn't happen overnight. That's why that's why we made extreme ownership dot com and
03:12:38.72 --> 03:12:40.72 The online training academy
03:12:41.44 --> 03:12:45.12 We're on there all the time there's courses that you can take you can go live sessions

03:14:36.64 --> 03:14:43.20 Like the algorithm thing I wrote the other fight the algorithm but the problem is when the jitz who video start rolling it's hard to fight that
03:14:43.20 --> 03:14:48.08 I was like when we watch that again, bro kind of embrace the algorithm in a way in a way
03:14:51.68 --> 03:14:55.52 And LinkedIn you're on LinkedIn yeah, I am on LinkedIn. Yeah, is that do you
03:14:56.08 --> 03:14:59.52 You like participate in LinkedIn because you mentioned it a few times today
03:15:00.56 --> 03:15:02.40 So I had it when I when I was
03:15:02.64 --> 03:15:06.88 Getting ready to transition out of the TV because that's how I started reaching out to people so yeah, I have one of those two
03:15:07.44 --> 03:15:12.000 I have LinkedIn too. Yeah, me too. So we're on there echo you got any final questions
03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.000 That's it. Oh actually
03:15:14.80 --> 03:15:20.24 So do you think and I think this may seem like an obvious answer, but more so
03:15:20.56 --> 03:15:26.56 Okay, so when you were growing up, you know, I had it so many chores like it was like hard right like so you got used to hard work really
03:15:27.52 --> 03:15:29.52 Quickly and thoroughly essentially
03:15:30.40 --> 03:15:36.64 Could you feel that like as you know you go through like you know hard things and combat buds like all these hard things or whatever
03:15:36.64 --> 03:15:41.04 And because you said you said something kind of interesting where you're like okay on the third time after you got rolled
03:15:41.04 --> 03:15:46.72 or whatever third time you passed with no no issues you said a lot of people like buds is like real hard for them
03:15:47.20 --> 03:15:50.56 Did you feel that your work ethic that was established
03:15:52.08 --> 03:15:57.04 Like was the factor that made it like a non-issue like could you feel that at the time?
03:15:58.24 --> 03:16:00.24 Yeah, absolutely
03:16:00.24 --> 03:16:04.08 You know it was crazy. I thought about my my stepdad a lot during whole week
03:16:04.64 --> 03:16:09.44 Because I thought about how hard he worked. I mean, I mean man worked non-stop seven days a week two jobs
03:16:09.44 --> 03:16:14.32 And I was going through hell we got thought about him. I was like you know what he can do that. I could do this right
03:16:14.32 --> 03:16:17.76 Yes, I want to provide for myself and my family like
03:16:18.40 --> 03:16:23.28 Yeah, yeah, that's what was thinking when you're saying that also it kind of makes you reflect like
03:16:24.48 --> 03:16:28.72 You reflect on like something like your childhood then I think man. I should give my kids more chores
03:16:29.84 --> 03:16:34.64 You know what's so weird about buds is you just never know who's gonna make it through you really don't
03:16:34.64 --> 03:16:41.36 And there's some silver spoon people that go through there and crush it and there's some silver spoon people that wash out day two
03:16:41.36 --> 03:16:47.52 And there's some freaking kids that grew up wherever in a shitty situation working their ass off and they quit
03:16:47.52 --> 03:16:50.96 Yeah, and there's some kids like that that are awesome. It's so bizarre
03:16:52.48 --> 03:16:55.12 It's very bizarre it's very hard to predict there is some
03:16:56.56 --> 03:16:58.56 Like some oh
03:16:58.56 --> 03:17:03.04 If the guy like they say if I'm someone wrestle that's a really good thing because you have to work really hard
03:17:03.04 --> 03:17:07.68 And wrestling that's a that's like an indicator, but it's by no means oh he wrestled
03:17:07.84 --> 03:17:15.76 He's gonna make it not at all not at all not even close. Yes, one of the many factors might be a little nudge in the direction of
03:17:17.04 --> 03:17:19.04 But it's no guarantee
03:17:19.04 --> 03:17:22.88 That's it. No, I'm good to good to see you again. Yeah, like well. Thank you for having me
03:17:23.60 --> 03:17:25.60 Any closing thoughts Carlos?
