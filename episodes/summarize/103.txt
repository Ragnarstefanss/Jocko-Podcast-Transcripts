I'm not going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I don't know if we can kind of do that. But nonetheless, so every time I feel anything like that, I think of like, you guys first and you guys are doing it in like crazy heat too, gear and like all this stuff. So this book was written before World War I and really this was the last big war is the wars that he went through the Napoleonic wars so he's kind of he's kind of saying you don't even know if this is like anymore you don't know what it's like. All right back to the book it was on the 15th of August when we first came up with the French and their skirmishers immediately commenced operations by raining a shower of balls upon us as we advanced which we returned without delay and I haven't said this yet but the reason they're saying balls and said around is because these guys are shooting balls with you round balls of lead and at this point there was some rifling head started to come about but what they basically just consider everything to be a ball of lead and that's why they're not accurate that's why they're only accurate out to 200 meters because they're not rifled like we have the tight rifling spinning bullets today. Well, what was interesting about that is when you said that, you had this kind of tone of like dang, like, term it like we got to take a break. They I'll say this as I always say I have to fast forward through this book I'm not reading the entire book even though the entire book is awesome in this point this point here they're embarking for Portugal we have another another campaign to go on back to the book I wish I could picture the splendid sight of the shipping in the downs at the time we embarked with about 20,000 men those were times which are so which the soldiers of our own more peaceful days have little conception of. Right, right, like, like, a little thing that is Bob, it actually bothers you in actual life. He sounds like he sounds like my, he sounds like my boy, howling's right here. Think about your little infection and your fingers, you know, your finger, you're, you've ever had one of those little stupid, like, where your fingernails get a little infection there? Nay, whatever folks may say upon the matter, I know from experience that in our army, the men like best be officer by gentleman, men whose education is rendered them more kind in manners than your course officer sprung from obscure origin and whose style is brutal and overbearing. So in content like now, we'll say that if there was a circumstance like that, where we're going to lose more guys if we bring this guy with us or one big luxury that we have now is we have air support. I would think that that would be kind of a good little escape, you know, from time to time to notice those types of things. So these guys were looked like they were going to desert and they got caught and he had a court martial on the spot and he was going to give them a hundred lashes or whatever the number was. He is ready to charge and only one guy out of the whole crew is looking like he's going to hold back and they talk about reputation here and that's definitely something that is when you get to this heel teams as you're a new guy someone tells you they'll say your reputation is everything and it's totally true and it's the same in any military organization what your reputation is because in the military you think ranks all important And so I said, hey, I got you know, we're just going to have to take, you know, no, no podcast for a few weeks. And the hoodie has like, I don't know if you know this kind of stuff. Because again, and I said, it's like if you're going for a cool protein powder, a lot of people that say, hey, what's a good protein powder? And I just said, like, hey, man, you know, you're a good dude. I'm looking at you guys something like, hey, I wonder if these guys are, you know, but no one said anything. Which I don't even know if it's an excuse, but it's a factor where these like hard actual hard times kind of call on you to exercise this kind of will. and I'm thinking, is everyone trying to act like this isn't like kind of kind of terrain? You know, like, you kind of, a lot of times you got to over communicate. So these riflemen, I would say from what I read about them, they're almost like a special ops unit and one big difference is they're wearing red jackets like the Brits were wear at this time. He regains a little bit of strength, he eventually crawls to a house, gets in the house and gets a little bit of food, gets a little bit of, I would love to say water, but he's not going to get his food and wine.
