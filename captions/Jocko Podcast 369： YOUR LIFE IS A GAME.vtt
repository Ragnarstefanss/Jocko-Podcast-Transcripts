00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.76
This is Johnco podcast number 369 with Echo Charles and me, Johnco Willink.

2
00:00:04.76 --> 00:00:05.84
Good evening Echo.

3
00:00:05.84 --> 00:00:06.84
Good evening.

4
00:00:06.84 --> 00:00:10.36
There's a famous speech.

5
00:00:10.36 --> 00:00:16.36
I think Tim Ferriss, I might be the first person that I heard talk about this speech.

6
00:00:16.36 --> 00:00:18.36
The speech is called This is Water.

7
00:00:18.36 --> 00:00:24.52
It's by a guy named David Foster Wallace and it's a graduation speech.

8
00:00:24.52 --> 00:00:26.52
You know, when people are graduating from college.

9
00:00:26.52 --> 00:00:30.32
I'm not going to go into David Foster Wallace's whole life.

10
00:00:30.32 --> 00:00:32.20
He was a professor.

11
00:00:32.20 --> 00:00:34.80
He was a writer.

12
00:00:34.80 --> 00:00:39.88
He was an author of books and he battled with depression his whole life and he eventually

13
00:00:39.88 --> 00:00:44.84
killed himself, which is awful, horrible.

14
00:00:44.84 --> 00:00:49.20
But at some point maybe we'll get into that.

15
00:00:49.20 --> 00:00:54.16
But I want to talk about his speech a little bit because it opens up an idea that I've

16
00:00:54.16 --> 00:00:59.60
been I've been engaged with for a while now.

17
00:00:59.60 --> 00:01:01.32
So his speech starts off like this.

18
00:01:01.32 --> 00:01:07.80
Greetings, parents and congratulations to Kenyon's graduating class of 2005.

19
00:01:07.80 --> 00:01:12.24
There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming

20
00:01:12.24 --> 00:01:17.82
the other way who nods at them and says, morning boys, how's the water?

21
00:01:17.82 --> 00:01:21.96
And the two young fish swim on for a bit and then eventually one of them looks over at

22
00:01:21.96 --> 00:01:29.04
the other and goes, what the hell is water?

23
00:01:29.04 --> 00:01:38.36
And so the point of this story is that, you know, we're in water and we're so used to the

24
00:01:38.36 --> 00:01:39.36
water.

25
00:01:39.36 --> 00:01:41.60
We're so encompassing the water that we don't even know that we're not.

26
00:01:41.60 --> 00:01:45.12
We don't notice it.

27
00:01:45.12 --> 00:01:47.20
Now what does this have to do with anything?

28
00:01:47.20 --> 00:01:50.12
Well, how does this apply?

29
00:01:50.12 --> 00:01:55.08
I mean, there's clearly there's a there's a topic that we can get into about appreciating

30
00:01:55.08 --> 00:02:00.64
life and that's the water that you're in and you can just be not appreciative of it.

31
00:02:00.64 --> 00:02:07.24
But I was thinking about it from a different perspective and we've talked about before

32
00:02:07.24 --> 00:02:13.48
on this podcast and you probably heard me say this before the best way to beat someone

33
00:02:13.48 --> 00:02:18.44
in a game is if they don't even know that they're playing the game.

34
00:02:18.44 --> 00:02:21.24
It was the best way to beat someone.

35
00:02:21.24 --> 00:02:25.76
They don't even know that it's happening and you're out maneuvering them because they

36
00:02:25.76 --> 00:02:28.08
don't know what's happening and then you beat them.

37
00:02:28.08 --> 00:02:33.32
I mean, it'd be like, imagine you're pre jujitsu, like you didn't know anything about jujitsu

38
00:02:33.32 --> 00:02:39.88
and you got into a fight with someone and they were doing things.

39
00:02:39.88 --> 00:02:40.88
You don't even know what they're doing.

40
00:02:40.88 --> 00:02:42.28
And they're getting the mountain.

41
00:02:42.28 --> 00:02:43.28
You don't even know what that is.

42
00:02:43.28 --> 00:02:44.64
So it's not, you're just beating them.

43
00:02:44.64 --> 00:02:46.64
They don't even know what's happening.

44
00:02:46.64 --> 00:02:54.68
So the best way to win a competition is for the opponent to not know that there is a competition.

45
00:02:54.68 --> 00:02:57.72
Sun Su's, we've had, we haven't had Sun Su on this podcast.

46
00:02:57.72 --> 00:03:02.88
He's been dead for a while, but you know, he, he talked about the goal is to win without

47
00:03:02.88 --> 00:03:04.88
fighting, right?

48
00:03:04.88 --> 00:03:08.24
The win without fighting when we want to fight.

49
00:03:08.24 --> 00:03:10.28
This is also the indirect approach, right?

50
00:03:10.28 --> 00:03:13.52
I don't want to get go head to head.

51
00:03:13.52 --> 00:03:19.32
So several months ago, I was talking with one of my friends and someone that I spend

52
00:03:19.32 --> 00:03:24.16
time with and talk to not all the time, but fairly regularly.

53
00:03:24.16 --> 00:03:29.32
And we were talking through some of his trials and tribulations and I started talking about

54
00:03:29.32 --> 00:03:33.48
the game.

55
00:03:33.48 --> 00:03:41.68
And maybe it was the way that I was referencing it or the way I said it.

56
00:03:41.68 --> 00:03:44.28
When I talked about it, look in leadership strategy and tactics, I talk about playing

57
00:03:44.28 --> 00:03:51.48
the game, which is a very specific reference to playing the game in a work environment,

58
00:03:51.48 --> 00:03:53.36
interacting with other people.

59
00:03:53.36 --> 00:03:59.96
But when I was talking to this friend of mine, I, I was talking about the game.

60
00:03:59.96 --> 00:04:04.52
You know, he was going through some stuff and I was talking about the game.

61
00:04:04.52 --> 00:04:11.64
And as I'm watching his face, as I'm talking about the game that he's engaged in, I really

62
00:04:11.64 --> 00:04:17.32
realized he didn't know he was in a game.

63
00:04:17.32 --> 00:04:20.20
Just like the fish not realizing they're in the water.

64
00:04:20.20 --> 00:04:21.80
So there's things going on in his life.

65
00:04:21.80 --> 00:04:22.96
There's things going on with his work.

66
00:04:22.96 --> 00:04:27.84
There's things going on with his marriage and there's maneuvers being made and I can

67
00:04:27.84 --> 00:04:29.80
see him because he's telling me what they are.

68
00:04:29.80 --> 00:04:36.12
He's telling me he doesn't realize that it's, that those are moves.

69
00:04:36.12 --> 00:04:43.40
And I looked at him, I said, like, Hey, you realize that this is a game, right?

70
00:04:43.40 --> 00:04:47.20
And he just gave me that blank stare and I realized, no, he didn't, he didn't know this

71
00:04:47.20 --> 00:04:50.04
was a game.

72
00:04:50.04 --> 00:04:54.56
And over the last several months, I've had a bunch of conversations, not a bunch, but

73
00:04:54.56 --> 00:04:59.52
I've had several, we'll say conversations like this.

74
00:04:59.52 --> 00:05:10.20
And I realized that a lot of people don't get this idea of the game that they're in.

75
00:05:10.20 --> 00:05:13.64
And I know, so I want to spend some time talking about this because I think a lot of people

76
00:05:13.64 --> 00:05:19.52
don't realize, I think a lot of people don't realize that they're in a game and that there

77
00:05:19.52 --> 00:05:20.52
is a game.

78
00:05:20.52 --> 00:05:24.96
In fact, there's multiple games going on.

79
00:05:24.96 --> 00:05:26.44
And they're in them.

80
00:05:26.44 --> 00:05:27.52
You're in them.

81
00:05:27.52 --> 00:05:30.12
I'm in them.

82
00:05:30.12 --> 00:05:36.80
So if you don't realize that you're in a game, you're not going to win.

83
00:05:36.80 --> 00:05:39.72
Things are happening and you're not going to win.

84
00:05:39.72 --> 00:05:43.36
You have to recognize that you're in a game and you actually have to recognize that you're

85
00:05:43.36 --> 00:05:45.48
in multiple games.

86
00:05:45.48 --> 00:05:49.64
Remember a long time ago, we had a conversation about ecosystems, right?

87
00:05:49.64 --> 00:05:51.96
That there's different ecosystems in the world.

88
00:05:51.96 --> 00:05:55.88
I actually had this conversation with Andrew Huberman recently, you know, talking about

89
00:05:55.88 --> 00:05:56.88
the ecosystem.

90
00:05:56.88 --> 00:06:00.28
He's in the ecosystem of academia.

91
00:06:00.28 --> 00:06:03.28
He's a he's a professor at Stanford.

92
00:06:03.28 --> 00:06:07.60
He's got a lab like really impressive to some people.

93
00:06:07.60 --> 00:06:11.56
There's some people that literally do not know where Stanford is.

94
00:06:11.56 --> 00:06:15.76
There's some people that don't care what kind of schooling you went to.

95
00:06:15.76 --> 00:06:17.44
There's Jiu Jitsu ecosystem.

96
00:06:17.44 --> 00:06:19.32
Oh, I'm a purple belt.

97
00:06:19.32 --> 00:06:20.68
I'm a brown belt.

98
00:06:20.68 --> 00:06:24.68
There's people that there's people that don't understand that to them a black belt and Jiu

99
00:06:24.68 --> 00:06:28.48
Jitsu is the same as a black belt and karate, they just like whatever, right?

100
00:06:28.48 --> 00:06:30.44
There's ecosystems at work.

101
00:06:30.44 --> 00:06:31.76
The SEAL teams is an ecosystem.

102
00:06:31.76 --> 00:06:37.52
The different guys in there to try to maneuver, trying to get to the to the to the top of

103
00:06:37.52 --> 00:06:39.64
that pyramid of the ecosystem.

104
00:06:39.64 --> 00:06:44.16
And so there's all these ecosystems and in those there's games, right?

105
00:06:44.16 --> 00:06:45.36
There's games that are being played.

106
00:06:45.36 --> 00:06:46.84
There's work games.

107
00:06:46.84 --> 00:06:49.28
There's relationships.

108
00:06:49.28 --> 00:06:50.28
There's financial games.

109
00:06:50.28 --> 00:06:52.84
You're in a financial game.

110
00:06:52.84 --> 00:06:55.84
There's fitness.

111
00:06:55.84 --> 00:06:58.72
There's a status game.

112
00:06:58.72 --> 00:07:00.24
There's a materialistic game.

113
00:07:00.24 --> 00:07:05.48
There's all these games are going in and all those are going on and all those are like

114
00:07:05.48 --> 00:07:08.20
subordinate games that are going on in your life.

115
00:07:08.20 --> 00:07:09.20
Possibly.

116
00:07:09.20 --> 00:07:10.20
You might not care about them.

117
00:07:10.20 --> 00:07:12.20
You know, you might not be playing one of those games.

118
00:07:12.20 --> 00:07:13.20
That's okay.

119
00:07:13.20 --> 00:07:14.40
You might not be playing the Jiu Jitsu game.

120
00:07:14.40 --> 00:07:15.40
You don't care about Jiu Jitsu.

121
00:07:15.40 --> 00:07:16.40
You might not be playing the financial game.

122
00:07:16.40 --> 00:07:18.92
That's okay.

123
00:07:18.92 --> 00:07:20.52
But you might be.

124
00:07:20.52 --> 00:07:23.92
You might be playing some of those subordinate games.

125
00:07:23.92 --> 00:07:33.92
And then there's the supreme game that you are playing, which is life, which is life

126
00:07:33.92 --> 00:07:34.92
viewed as a game.

127
00:07:34.92 --> 00:07:41.72
Now, there's sort of a diminishing tone, right?

128
00:07:41.72 --> 00:07:43.24
To say that something's a game, right?

129
00:07:43.24 --> 00:07:45.24
There's a diminishing tone because guess what else is a game?

130
00:07:45.24 --> 00:07:46.24
Tic-Tac-Toe.

131
00:07:46.24 --> 00:07:47.24
Right.

132
00:07:47.24 --> 00:07:49.12
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game.

133
00:07:49.12 --> 00:07:51.24
Diminishing ladders is a game.

134
00:07:51.24 --> 00:07:52.24
Sure.

135
00:07:52.24 --> 00:07:53.24
Yeah.

136
00:07:53.24 --> 00:07:54.24
Right?

137
00:07:54.24 --> 00:07:57.08
So, sometimes I've said this before.

138
00:07:57.08 --> 00:07:58.16
This isn't a game, right?

139
00:07:58.16 --> 00:08:01.80
I've said that before in certain contexts.

140
00:08:01.80 --> 00:08:02.80
Okay.

141
00:08:02.80 --> 00:08:04.20
This isn't a game.

142
00:08:04.20 --> 00:08:07.68
So to now I'm sitting here saying everything's a game, but what we're talking about, I'm

143
00:08:07.68 --> 00:08:08.68
not trying to devalue.

144
00:08:08.68 --> 00:08:14.92
I'm not trying to diminish or not trying to depreciate life and I'm not trying to devalue,

145
00:08:14.92 --> 00:08:18.48
depreciate or diminish some of these like relationship games.

146
00:08:18.48 --> 00:08:19.96
Like, oh, it's a game to you.

147
00:08:19.96 --> 00:08:20.96
You see what I'm saying?

148
00:08:20.96 --> 00:08:26.20
There's a negative connotation, but it depends on the definition that you're going to use.

149
00:08:26.20 --> 00:08:30.16
And I actually looked around and see if there was another better word, but there actually

150
00:08:30.16 --> 00:08:31.72
isn't.

151
00:08:31.72 --> 00:08:33.20
There's just multiple definitions.

152
00:08:33.20 --> 00:08:34.92
Yes, a game can be Tic-Tac-Toe.

153
00:08:34.92 --> 00:08:36.52
Yes, game can be shoots and ladders.

154
00:08:36.52 --> 00:08:38.08
Yes, game can be football game.

155
00:08:38.08 --> 00:08:41.96
And to compare, you know, people get mad, compare football to like combat.

156
00:08:41.96 --> 00:08:43.72
Like, what are you doing?

157
00:08:43.72 --> 00:08:44.72
That's not combat.

158
00:08:44.72 --> 00:08:45.72
And it's true.

159
00:08:45.72 --> 00:08:51.84
And I'm not trying to take everything and compare it to shoots and ladders or what's

160
00:08:51.84 --> 00:08:52.84
the candy game?

161
00:08:52.84 --> 00:08:54.64
Maybe that was shoots and ladders.

162
00:08:54.64 --> 00:08:55.64
Candy Crush.

163
00:08:55.64 --> 00:08:56.64
No, Candy Land.

164
00:08:56.64 --> 00:08:57.64
I forget.

165
00:08:57.64 --> 00:08:59.000
There's another game, Candy Land.

166
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.48
That was like up there with shoots and ladders when I was a kid.

167
00:09:02.48 --> 00:09:09.56
So you could take that definition, this sort of frivolous game that you play for fun, but

168
00:09:09.56 --> 00:09:19.24
there's some definition of game that means you've got a competition based on rules where

169
00:09:19.24 --> 00:09:29.04
you're trying to score points or earn value in order to beat an opponent.

170
00:09:29.04 --> 00:09:34.28
That's a game, which again, that's what combat combat is the most serious of games.

171
00:09:34.28 --> 00:09:35.28
And that's what it is.

172
00:09:35.28 --> 00:09:36.28
It's a game.

173
00:09:36.28 --> 00:09:37.28
There's rules.

174
00:09:37.28 --> 00:09:38.28
We're trying to maneuver.

175
00:09:38.28 --> 00:09:40.16
We're trying to move the rules while we beat the opponent.

176
00:09:40.16 --> 00:09:43.24
It's competition.

177
00:09:43.24 --> 00:09:47.56
And if you think about life, it's similar because in life, guess what?

178
00:09:47.56 --> 00:09:51.16
There's rules.

179
00:09:51.16 --> 00:09:53.12
And you can break some of the rules of life.

180
00:09:53.12 --> 00:09:54.48
There could be consequences.

181
00:09:54.48 --> 00:09:55.64
You can actually choose different.

182
00:09:55.64 --> 00:09:57.56
You can have different rules in your life than I have in my life.

183
00:09:57.56 --> 00:09:59.64
We could have different rules.

184
00:09:59.64 --> 00:10:05.12
So you actually have some say in the set of rules that you're going to go by.

185
00:10:05.12 --> 00:10:14.08
You get somebody with no morals, these people that rip off billions of dollars from other

186
00:10:14.08 --> 00:10:19.24
people that guys operating by a different set of rules than a normal person and should

187
00:10:19.24 --> 00:10:21.64
be punished severely for those actions.

188
00:10:21.64 --> 00:10:27.84
But that's what he was falling the rules that he thought or maybe he was breaking them.

189
00:10:27.84 --> 00:10:29.36
But there's rules.

190
00:10:29.36 --> 00:10:30.64
That's what's happening in life.

191
00:10:30.64 --> 00:10:32.36
You've got rules that you're following.

192
00:10:32.36 --> 00:10:35.72
You have goals that you're trying to achieve.

193
00:10:35.72 --> 00:10:39.28
So you're trying to score goals or earn points.

194
00:10:39.28 --> 00:10:42.32
That's happening.

195
00:10:42.32 --> 00:10:46.68
Most likely you're going to have to compete with others to achieve your goal.

196
00:10:46.68 --> 00:10:48.60
Most likely.

197
00:10:48.60 --> 00:10:52.04
Whether you're a caveman and we're trying to survive and you're trying to eat, we just

198
00:10:52.04 --> 00:10:58.52
killed a damn woolly mammoth and now we got to fight over who gets more meat.

199
00:10:58.52 --> 00:11:01.96
There's limited resources or you're running a business, I'm running a business.

200
00:11:01.96 --> 00:11:02.96
We're making widgets.

201
00:11:02.96 --> 00:11:03.96
I'm making widgets.

202
00:11:03.96 --> 00:11:06.68
We got to compete.

203
00:11:06.68 --> 00:11:14.36
So when I'm talking about the game of life or really these sub games, these subordinate

204
00:11:14.36 --> 00:11:17.44
games in life, don't think of the lowest definition.

205
00:11:17.44 --> 00:11:20.52
So if you're already mad, someone's mad at me, life isn't a game.

206
00:11:20.52 --> 00:11:22.96
They deleted the podcast, right?

207
00:11:22.96 --> 00:11:24.44
Life is not a game.

208
00:11:24.44 --> 00:11:27.44
Oh, but it is.

209
00:11:27.44 --> 00:11:30.36
But don't think of that low kind of base definition.

210
00:11:30.36 --> 00:11:36.04
Think of the straightforward definition, a competition executed according to rules where

211
00:11:36.04 --> 00:11:39.80
the goal is to achieve some kind of victory.

212
00:11:39.80 --> 00:11:45.40
And by the way, the victory is also defined by rules, right?

213
00:11:45.40 --> 00:11:50.54
Because for some reason they make a field goal worth this many points and a touchdown

214
00:11:50.54 --> 00:11:52.84
worth that many points.

215
00:11:52.84 --> 00:11:55.64
Those are just, they just made that up.

216
00:11:55.64 --> 00:12:00.60
So depending on what rules you put in your life, you winning might look different for

217
00:12:00.60 --> 00:12:02.000
you and to me.

218
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And that's okay.

219
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.52
That's the thing, we're not disparaging the set of rules you're playing or the goals

220
00:12:06.52 --> 00:12:09.24
that you have or the goals that I'm playing or the rules that I'm playing or the goals

221
00:12:09.24 --> 00:12:10.24
that I have.

222
00:12:10.24 --> 00:12:12.60
I'm not disparaging those things.

223
00:12:12.60 --> 00:12:14.28
They might just might be different.

224
00:12:14.28 --> 00:12:18.80
What we have to watch out for is you have to make sure that you do know the rules that

225
00:12:18.80 --> 00:12:19.80
you're going to play by.

226
00:12:19.80 --> 00:12:22.000
You have to make sure you know what you're trying to achieve.

227
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.64
What does victory look like for you?

228
00:12:26.64 --> 00:12:31.88
So that's, that's what's happening.

229
00:12:31.88 --> 00:12:38.12
Now during this conversation that I had with this friend of mine, he eventually got that

230
00:12:38.12 --> 00:12:42.64
look on his face that he understood that, okay, I get it.

231
00:12:42.64 --> 00:12:44.40
I'm playing a game.

232
00:12:44.40 --> 00:12:46.68
I'm in a game.

233
00:12:46.68 --> 00:12:50.40
He understood it, but he don't, he just kind of like realized it.

234
00:12:50.40 --> 00:12:55.36
And then he started asking me questions like, what are the rules of the game?

235
00:12:55.36 --> 00:12:57.72
How do you win the game?

236
00:12:57.72 --> 00:13:00.16
Where do you focus?

237
00:13:00.16 --> 00:13:02.48
Do you ever walk away?

238
00:13:02.48 --> 00:13:03.48
Can you surrender?

239
00:13:03.48 --> 00:13:04.48
Is it a marathon?

240
00:13:04.48 --> 00:13:05.48
Is it a sprint?

241
00:13:05.48 --> 00:13:11.08
Like he started asking me detailed questions about the game.

242
00:13:11.08 --> 00:13:14.40
And I've been thinking for a while about these things.

243
00:13:14.40 --> 00:13:20.20
I'm going to spend some time addressing these on maybe a podcast or two, maybe seven podcasts,

244
00:13:20.20 --> 00:13:21.20
maybe 12 podcasts.

245
00:13:21.20 --> 00:13:22.92
I don't know.

246
00:13:22.92 --> 00:13:29.12
But let's start with this.

247
00:13:29.12 --> 00:13:31.76
How do you know you're in a game?

248
00:13:31.76 --> 00:13:32.76
How do you know?

249
00:13:32.76 --> 00:13:34.44
Well, the short answer is you are.

250
00:13:34.44 --> 00:13:37.000
You absolutely are in a game.

251
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.96
And in order to see that, you have to take a step back and look at this.

252
00:13:40.96 --> 00:13:47.60
And to get here, what I recommend, I recommend this often as a tool for detachment.

253
00:13:47.60 --> 00:13:51.76
And that is to take a step back and actually write things down.

254
00:13:51.76 --> 00:13:54.04
Actually put pen to paper.

255
00:13:54.04 --> 00:13:59.64
If you don't know that you're in a game right now, take a step back, sit down and write

256
00:13:59.64 --> 00:14:03.84
down, ask yourself some good questions.

257
00:14:03.84 --> 00:14:06.44
What are my objectives?

258
00:14:06.44 --> 00:14:11.12
But if you're looking at your life or you're looking at your relationship or you're looking

259
00:14:11.12 --> 00:14:15.88
at your job, you need to take a step back and say, what are my objectives?

260
00:14:15.88 --> 00:14:20.76
Because if you don't know what your objectives are, you definitely don't know you're in a

261
00:14:20.76 --> 00:14:21.76
game.

262
00:14:21.76 --> 00:14:24.68
Imagine you're walking around a piece of grass and all of a sudden people go running

263
00:14:24.68 --> 00:14:26.52
by you and one of them is holding a ball.

264
00:14:26.52 --> 00:14:28.000
Like, you don't know what they're doing.

265
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Right?

266
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.72
Maybe you should grab that dude and put him to the ground.

267
00:14:31.72 --> 00:14:33.44
But you don't even know what he's doing.

268
00:14:33.44 --> 00:14:34.96
You don't know what direction he's going.

269
00:14:34.96 --> 00:14:37.12
There's big, there's lines on the grass.

270
00:14:37.12 --> 00:14:41.000
There's numbers around 10, 20, 30, 40.

271
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.16
Right?

272
00:14:42.16 --> 00:14:44.24
You don't know what they mean.

273
00:14:44.24 --> 00:14:47.36
So write down, okay, what?

274
00:14:47.36 --> 00:14:48.76
Okay, I get it.

275
00:14:48.76 --> 00:14:54.56
I'm trying to get this ball into that area of grass that's painted red.

276
00:14:54.56 --> 00:14:55.56
Okay.

277
00:14:55.56 --> 00:15:01.32
Think of how your whole world improves.

278
00:15:01.32 --> 00:15:03.48
If you're standing on a piece of grass, you have no idea what's going on.

279
00:15:03.48 --> 00:15:04.48
People are running around.

280
00:15:04.48 --> 00:15:05.48
They're kicking things.

281
00:15:05.48 --> 00:15:06.48
They're throwing things.

282
00:15:06.48 --> 00:15:08.000
And you don't know what's happening.

283
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.84
But as soon as you go, oh, I'm trying to, these guys with the red shirts on are going

284
00:15:12.84 --> 00:15:15.52
against the guys with the white shirts on.

285
00:15:15.52 --> 00:15:19.16
And we're trying to get this ball into that red area.

286
00:15:19.16 --> 00:15:20.16
Okay.

287
00:15:20.16 --> 00:15:26.40
Think of how much more productive you can be in that scenario.

288
00:15:26.40 --> 00:15:27.40
Just knowing that.

289
00:15:27.40 --> 00:15:28.76
Just knowing that.

290
00:15:28.76 --> 00:15:33.28
So how many people are sitting there on the field of life and they don't even know what

291
00:15:33.28 --> 00:15:34.28
direction they're going.

292
00:15:34.28 --> 00:15:35.80
They don't know what the objective is.

293
00:15:35.80 --> 00:15:37.86
They don't know what their objective is.

294
00:15:37.86 --> 00:15:44.44
So the first step you take is you actually write down, okay, here's what I'm trying,

295
00:15:44.44 --> 00:15:45.64
here's where I'm trying to go.

296
00:15:45.64 --> 00:15:46.64
Here's what I'm trying to do.

297
00:15:46.64 --> 00:15:49.24
This is my objective.

298
00:15:49.24 --> 00:15:50.96
And then you try and figure out, okay, what are the rules here?

299
00:15:50.96 --> 00:15:54.32
Like, what are some of the rules you have to obey?

300
00:15:54.32 --> 00:15:55.32
Because there's rules.

301
00:15:55.32 --> 00:15:57.16
There's societal rules.

302
00:15:57.16 --> 00:15:58.52
There's religious rules.

303
00:15:58.52 --> 00:15:59.64
There's family rules.

304
00:15:59.64 --> 00:16:05.40
There's rules that are in place that you, you can't just, if the goal is to get money,

305
00:16:05.40 --> 00:16:07.000
well, you can't just steal it.

306
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.44
You can try, but you get caught.

307
00:16:08.44 --> 00:16:10.08
There's going to be consequences.

308
00:16:10.08 --> 00:16:14.84
You can't, you know, you have relationships with your family.

309
00:16:14.84 --> 00:16:18.24
You need to protect those relationships with your family in most cases.

310
00:16:18.24 --> 00:16:22.76
Those are rules that you write down.

311
00:16:22.76 --> 00:16:25.36
Then you start figuring out, okay, what strategies can I use?

312
00:16:25.36 --> 00:16:27.40
What tactics can I use?

313
00:16:27.40 --> 00:16:33.32
Now that I know what my objective is, what should I actually be doing tactically on a

314
00:16:33.32 --> 00:16:38.04
day to day, week to week basis to try and progress towards this goal that I just figured

315
00:16:38.04 --> 00:16:45.16
out I had and then write those things down.

316
00:16:45.16 --> 00:16:53.68
And I think what you will see as you start to write down these objectives and these rules

317
00:16:53.68 --> 00:16:57.56
and these strategies and these tactics, I think what you'll start to realize is that

318
00:16:57.56 --> 00:17:01.44
you'll start to see, oh, there's a couple of different games going on here.

319
00:17:01.44 --> 00:17:05.12
Probably a real obvious one is work.

320
00:17:05.12 --> 00:17:10.28
It's also an obvious one because a lot of times you can see what your objective is.

321
00:17:10.28 --> 00:17:12.96
Oh, I want to get paid.

322
00:17:12.96 --> 00:17:14.52
I want to get promoted.

323
00:17:14.52 --> 00:17:18.000
I want to move into a leadership position or I want to grow this, but you know, what

324
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
something like that.

325
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.08
So that generally speaking, work is a little bit more identifiable.

326
00:17:24.08 --> 00:17:28.40
Not always because you talk to some people, you know, we go into companies that are on

327
00:17:28.40 --> 00:17:31.76
front, oh, what are your goals?

328
00:17:31.76 --> 00:17:33.76
You know, talk to a front line manager.

329
00:17:33.76 --> 00:17:37.08
Oh, what are your goals here?

330
00:17:37.08 --> 00:17:38.72
Make good money this quarter.

331
00:17:38.72 --> 00:17:40.08
They don't have any long term goals.

332
00:17:40.08 --> 00:17:41.28
They're going to be strategic goals.

333
00:17:41.28 --> 00:17:43.04
Oh, what's the goal of the company?

334
00:17:43.04 --> 00:17:45.16
Oh, make money this quarter.

335
00:17:45.16 --> 00:17:47.36
So that means they're not thinking strategic.

336
00:17:47.36 --> 00:17:52.08
They're thinking tactical, but they at least will have some idea in most cases.

337
00:17:52.08 --> 00:17:54.32
I mean, imagine you were a bouncer.

338
00:17:54.32 --> 00:17:55.32
Sure.

339
00:17:55.32 --> 00:17:56.32
Right.

340
00:17:56.32 --> 00:17:58.04
Back in the day.

341
00:17:58.04 --> 00:18:01.32
Did you ever think to yourself, all right, what am I trying to do here?

342
00:18:01.32 --> 00:18:02.32
Yeah.

343
00:18:02.32 --> 00:18:06.48
I mean, there was a point where it hit me really hard and I started thinking that I was gone

344
00:18:06.48 --> 00:18:07.48
soon after that.

345
00:18:07.48 --> 00:18:08.48
Yeah.

346
00:18:08.48 --> 00:18:10.20
Because you start thinking, wait a second, what?

347
00:18:10.20 --> 00:18:16.04
Like if I win this game, what do I get?

348
00:18:16.04 --> 00:18:18.88
What do I put into it and what do I get?

349
00:18:18.88 --> 00:18:23.32
That's another thing to think about is like, what is not just what's the objective and

350
00:18:23.32 --> 00:18:26.52
what's the victory, but what do I get for that victory?

351
00:18:26.52 --> 00:18:35.96
Because a paycheck on Sunday and a wasted Friday, a wasted Saturday, you know, the hanging

352
00:18:35.96 --> 00:18:39.000
around scene, you shouldn't really, it's not really progressing your life.

353
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.12
You start realizing, oh, this, what am I doing here?

354
00:18:42.12 --> 00:18:43.64
So you actually had that revelation.

355
00:18:43.64 --> 00:18:44.64
Yes.

356
00:18:44.64 --> 00:18:45.64
Yeah.

357
00:18:45.64 --> 00:18:48.88
How long did it take you to make the decision to bail?

358
00:18:48.88 --> 00:18:55.96
Well, actually it's funny because even right when you just said bouncer, it hit me so clearly

359
00:18:55.96 --> 00:18:56.96
remembering that experience.

360
00:18:56.96 --> 00:18:57.96
In hindsight.

361
00:18:57.96 --> 00:18:58.96
Yeah.

362
00:18:58.96 --> 00:19:00.52
Inside I was like, damn, but it did hit me.

363
00:19:00.52 --> 00:19:03.24
So at first, yeah, you're like just floating.

364
00:19:03.24 --> 00:19:07.64
You're like the game, if you even recognize which I did it because I just needed a job,

365
00:19:07.64 --> 00:19:09.84
I had experience so it's easy to get.

366
00:19:09.84 --> 00:19:11.28
So I got it.

367
00:19:11.28 --> 00:19:12.28
And then it was just good fun.

368
00:19:12.28 --> 00:19:15.12
So it was literally just moment to moment, day to day.

369
00:19:15.12 --> 00:19:23.28
So short term gratification, like daily basis, like literally nightly, literally nightly.

370
00:19:23.28 --> 00:19:26.64
And that went on, you know, early twenties, who cares, you know, kind of a thing.

371
00:19:26.64 --> 00:19:29.12
As far as how it went for me anyway.

372
00:19:29.12 --> 00:19:32.56
And then yeah, once I hit mid twenties, that's when it started to hit me.

373
00:19:32.56 --> 00:19:35.92
Whoa, like I've been here like two years, years.

374
00:19:35.92 --> 00:19:38.52
And what do you have to show for it?

375
00:19:38.52 --> 00:19:41.36
Nothing, same spot, but which was fine because it's still fun.

376
00:19:41.36 --> 00:19:43.12
I'm still young, all this stuff.

377
00:19:43.12 --> 00:19:48.28
But you know, when you hit 25 ish, you're kind of like, oh, you see older people in

378
00:19:48.28 --> 00:19:49.28
that scene.

379
00:19:49.28 --> 00:19:54.40
Oh, that person's like kind of older, cool, fine, but I didn't feel that that's where

380
00:19:54.40 --> 00:19:55.92
I wanted to be kind of a thing.

381
00:19:55.92 --> 00:19:59.16
All that stuff started to creep in my mind or whatever.

382
00:19:59.16 --> 00:20:03.72
And then yeah, you start to realize like, okay, I should, I should at least pay attention

383
00:20:03.72 --> 00:20:07.08
to the future, like long, medium, whatever future.

384
00:20:07.08 --> 00:20:11.68
And then I, but I had been not paying attention for so long that I wasn't even looking outside

385
00:20:11.68 --> 00:20:14.72
of my like trajectory, you know.

386
00:20:14.72 --> 00:20:16.64
So I started making goals within that same trajectory.

387
00:20:16.64 --> 00:20:20.20
I can maybe I'll be a manager, maybe I'll gain some skills here and bro, they were all

388
00:20:20.20 --> 00:20:21.20
about it.

389
00:20:21.20 --> 00:20:24.24
The all my superiors, they're all about it.

390
00:20:24.24 --> 00:20:25.64
They're like, oh yeah, cool.

391
00:20:25.64 --> 00:20:28.56
And then so I started to kind of pursue that a little bit.

392
00:20:28.56 --> 00:20:30.76
And then after a while, I was like, with you about your career.

393
00:20:30.76 --> 00:20:32.68
I'm like, Hey, because they got you there.

394
00:20:32.68 --> 00:20:34.12
They think, oh, yeah, we got him.

395
00:20:34.12 --> 00:20:35.12
Yep.

396
00:20:35.12 --> 00:20:36.12
It fully did.

397
00:20:36.12 --> 00:20:37.12
Like, oh yeah.

398
00:20:37.12 --> 00:20:38.68
And just the kind of guy we need.

399
00:20:38.68 --> 00:20:39.68
Yep.

400
00:20:39.68 --> 00:20:40.68
Yeah.

401
00:20:40.68 --> 00:20:44.12
Essentially, you know, you know what that manager paycheck looks like.

402
00:20:44.12 --> 00:20:45.68
This is such a perfect thing.

403
00:20:45.68 --> 00:20:47.48
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

404
00:20:47.48 --> 00:20:49.80
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

405
00:20:49.80 --> 00:20:51.16
And you had a little moment.

406
00:20:51.16 --> 00:20:54.40
This happens to a lot of people, you know, you see, you see the person that's doing

407
00:20:54.40 --> 00:20:57.76
what you're doing, but they're 10 years older than you.

408
00:20:57.76 --> 00:21:03.12
And you think, wait a second, you have a moment of clarity where you go, wait a second.

409
00:21:03.12 --> 00:21:06.16
That some people have a moment of clarity.

410
00:21:06.16 --> 00:21:07.96
Well, wait a second, that's going to be me.

411
00:21:07.96 --> 00:21:11.24
Some people say, Oh no, that'll never happen to me.

412
00:21:11.24 --> 00:21:14.56
But in order for it to not happen, you got to get, you got to, you got to make some

413
00:21:14.56 --> 00:21:15.56
adjustments.

414
00:21:15.56 --> 00:21:18.20
So this is exactly what I'm talking about.

415
00:21:18.20 --> 00:21:21.08
Like this is exactly what I'm talking about.

416
00:21:21.08 --> 00:21:26.08
From the work perspective, you're in a work job, you're doing your job and you're looking

417
00:21:26.08 --> 00:21:28.76
and you start realizing, okay, what is this game that I'm playing?

418
00:21:28.76 --> 00:21:32.20
Because you're, you are on the field, but there's plays happening.

419
00:21:32.20 --> 00:21:33.20
There's things going on.

420
00:21:33.20 --> 00:21:36.60
You don't even know what's, you don't know what's happening.

421
00:21:36.60 --> 00:21:39.08
So that's a good step to take.

422
00:21:39.08 --> 00:21:40.08
Now here's another one.

423
00:21:40.08 --> 00:21:43.64
Here's another game that you're in, whether you want to be in it or not.

424
00:21:43.64 --> 00:21:45.16
And you should know you're in health.

425
00:21:45.16 --> 00:21:46.16
Yeah.

426
00:21:46.16 --> 00:21:50.56
Health is a game that you're in.

427
00:21:50.56 --> 00:21:54.36
And if you don't recognize that you're in this game, again, that's when you look at

428
00:21:54.36 --> 00:21:58.04
somebody that's 10 years older than you and they're not in good physical condition.

429
00:21:58.04 --> 00:22:00.56
They're having health problems.

430
00:22:00.56 --> 00:22:01.56
They look terrible.

431
00:22:01.56 --> 00:22:03.36
They feel terrible.

432
00:22:03.36 --> 00:22:07.36
And did they, did they 10 years prior say, you know what I really want to do?

433
00:22:07.36 --> 00:22:11.000
I really want to put on 48 pounds of, you know, fat.

434
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.72
I want, I want my heart rate to go catastrophic.

435
00:22:15.72 --> 00:22:19.28
I want to just look like crap and feel like crap.

436
00:22:19.28 --> 00:22:21.44
There's zero people say that.

437
00:22:21.44 --> 00:22:22.44
And yet there they are.

438
00:22:22.44 --> 00:22:23.44
Why?

439
00:22:23.44 --> 00:22:24.44
They didn't realize that they were in a game.

440
00:22:24.44 --> 00:22:26.52
They didn't realize that there's rules to that game.

441
00:22:26.52 --> 00:22:28.32
Like, here's the rules.

442
00:22:28.32 --> 00:22:29.32
There's rules you got to follow.

443
00:22:29.32 --> 00:22:33.32
If you don't follow them, you break those rules, you're going to look up and you won't

444
00:22:33.32 --> 00:22:37.16
be, you won't have achieved your objective.

445
00:22:37.16 --> 00:22:40.28
And if you don't know that there's an objective, you better start paying attention to this

446
00:22:40.28 --> 00:22:47.000
podcast right now at this moment in time.

447
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.92
Relationships, right?

448
00:22:48.92 --> 00:22:49.92
And this is another one.

449
00:22:49.92 --> 00:22:54.52
I was talking about this with my daughter because when you say, oh, it's a relationship.

450
00:22:54.52 --> 00:22:57.04
It's a game, total negative connotation, right?

451
00:22:57.04 --> 00:23:00.48
But what if I said, hey, you know, I got a relationship with Echo Charles.

452
00:23:00.48 --> 00:23:01.62
He's a friend of mine.

453
00:23:01.62 --> 00:23:02.62
It's a game.

454
00:23:02.62 --> 00:23:03.62
Here's what I'm trying to do.

455
00:23:03.62 --> 00:23:05.40
Trying to build a good relationship, trying to build trust.

456
00:23:05.40 --> 00:23:08.72
Like all those things are positive.

457
00:23:08.72 --> 00:23:11.92
And yet it's a game because you got maneuvers you got to make.

458
00:23:11.92 --> 00:23:16.08
You got to follow certain rules in order to build that trust, in order to build that respect.

459
00:23:16.08 --> 00:23:18.60
So all those things are going on.

460
00:23:18.60 --> 00:23:25.000
And then you've got life and you've got, you know, legacy and whatnot.

461
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.72
And I think, so we got these categories.

462
00:23:29.72 --> 00:23:30.72
And what are your pillars?

463
00:23:30.72 --> 00:23:31.72
You got your pillars.

464
00:23:31.72 --> 00:23:32.72
What are your pillars?

465
00:23:32.72 --> 00:23:33.72
What are they?

466
00:23:33.72 --> 00:23:34.72
Pillars?

467
00:23:34.72 --> 00:23:35.72
There's eight of them?

468
00:23:35.72 --> 00:23:36.72
I thought there was five.

469
00:23:36.72 --> 00:23:37.72
What are your pillars?

470
00:23:37.72 --> 00:23:38.72
They're partners.

471
00:23:38.72 --> 00:23:40.72
They're like partners.

472
00:23:40.72 --> 00:23:41.72
Okay.

473
00:23:41.72 --> 00:23:45.96
Health and physical capability are two.

474
00:23:45.96 --> 00:23:52.44
So and then so health physically, your income and what you do with your time.

475
00:23:52.44 --> 00:23:54.48
So they can, their partners as well.

476
00:23:54.48 --> 00:23:55.48
Interesting.

477
00:23:55.48 --> 00:23:56.48
Interesting.

478
00:23:56.48 --> 00:23:58.96
Oh, your spirituality and your worldview.

479
00:23:58.96 --> 00:24:00.52
That's another two.

480
00:24:00.52 --> 00:24:03.16
And then your relationships, friendly and romantic.

481
00:24:03.16 --> 00:24:05.08
Okay.

482
00:24:05.08 --> 00:24:10.16
These are, you know, these are things that if you broke those down, health is a game,

483
00:24:10.16 --> 00:24:13.56
income is a game, spirituality, I'm not sure how we pin that one down.

484
00:24:13.56 --> 00:24:14.80
I'm not sure what you mean by that.

485
00:24:14.80 --> 00:24:16.16
Your place in the world.

486
00:24:16.16 --> 00:24:17.16
Okay.

487
00:24:17.16 --> 00:24:18.16
So it's game.

488
00:24:18.16 --> 00:24:19.16
Understanding your place in the world.

489
00:24:19.16 --> 00:24:20.16
Yeah.

490
00:24:20.16 --> 00:24:21.16
Yeah.

491
00:24:21.16 --> 00:24:22.16
And where you're going in the world.

492
00:24:22.16 --> 00:24:23.16
Yeah.

493
00:24:23.16 --> 00:24:25.32
To me, more importantly, like, Hey, where am I going in the world?

494
00:24:25.32 --> 00:24:26.32
Yeah.

495
00:24:26.32 --> 00:24:30.32
Well, I've always thought of it in this way where, you know, because a lot of times,

496
00:24:30.32 --> 00:24:34.16
spirituality, that's another just, I mean, just you asking that really, that's really

497
00:24:34.16 --> 00:24:37.28
indicative of how I think a lot of people kind of regard spiritual.

498
00:24:37.28 --> 00:24:39.16
It has different meanings for different people.

499
00:24:39.16 --> 00:24:40.24
So I thought about that.

500
00:24:40.24 --> 00:24:43.88
And I think just understanding your place in the world, you know how like, if you look

501
00:24:43.88 --> 00:24:47.80
at the world, just all of existence that you understand as one big puzzle, like, where

502
00:24:47.80 --> 00:24:48.80
are you in that puzzle?

503
00:24:48.80 --> 00:24:53.08
You know, that little piece, because you fit to the pieces next to you somehow.

504
00:24:53.08 --> 00:24:58.44
And so how do you fit and how does that puzzle kind of form as a whole, you know, compared

505
00:24:58.44 --> 00:25:00.08
to where you are in it?

506
00:25:00.08 --> 00:25:03.40
So it's just like, like that, like your place in the world.

507
00:25:03.40 --> 00:25:04.40
Yes.

508
00:25:04.40 --> 00:25:08.80
But a lot, that's sort of like saying, I know what my place is on the field.

509
00:25:08.80 --> 00:25:09.80
Yeah.

510
00:25:09.80 --> 00:25:10.80
But you got to know what's happening on the field.

511
00:25:10.80 --> 00:25:12.04
Like you got to understand what's going on.

512
00:25:12.04 --> 00:25:13.04
What's the importance of it?

513
00:25:13.04 --> 00:25:15.32
And yeah, yeah, fully, you're right.

514
00:25:15.32 --> 00:25:20.52
So when I say, when I was talking about right taking a moment to write these things down,

515
00:25:20.52 --> 00:25:24.52
to me, it's sort of like what happens when people say, I'm going to write down my New

516
00:25:24.52 --> 00:25:26.52
Year's resolution, write down my goals.

517
00:25:26.52 --> 00:25:29.36
Like, you know, you know, a lot of people, they'll say, Oh, if you got to write down

518
00:25:29.36 --> 00:25:33.16
your goals in order for them to come true, there's, that's, that's a good tactic.

519
00:25:33.16 --> 00:25:39.12
And what, when you do that, you're actually writing down a goal.

520
00:25:39.12 --> 00:25:41.80
You're sort of, you're sort of clarifying the game.

521
00:25:41.80 --> 00:25:43.56
You're clarifying the objective of the game.

522
00:25:43.56 --> 00:25:47.16
So that's when you write down your New Year's resolution, you're saying, okay, I'm entering

523
00:25:47.16 --> 00:25:48.24
this game.

524
00:25:48.24 --> 00:25:53.96
And for that alone can help you saying, Oh, there's a game going on here.

525
00:25:53.96 --> 00:25:56.28
I eat junk food every night.

526
00:25:56.28 --> 00:26:00.36
And if I keep eating junk food, I'm going to lose this game of health.

527
00:26:00.36 --> 00:26:04.68
So writing it down and saying, Okay, I want to lose weight.

528
00:26:04.68 --> 00:26:07.08
I want to be more healthy.

529
00:26:07.08 --> 00:26:08.68
Here's the rules I got to follow.

530
00:26:08.68 --> 00:26:11.80
And then all of a sudden you've defined the game and now you can start to make progress.

531
00:26:11.80 --> 00:26:15.56
Whereas if you don't do that, you know what the hell's going on in your life.

532
00:26:15.56 --> 00:26:18.52
So what games are you are you in?

533
00:26:18.52 --> 00:26:19.52
Are we in?

534
00:26:19.52 --> 00:26:27.32
Well, as you mentioned, like job, work, income, what are the rules there?

535
00:26:27.32 --> 00:26:30.12
Well, you're going to have, you got to earn money, right?

536
00:26:30.12 --> 00:26:32.76
You want to get promoted possibly.

537
00:26:32.76 --> 00:26:36.76
Not everyone wants to get promoted, get, learn some kind of a skill.

538
00:26:36.76 --> 00:26:40.16
There's a, there's a positive benefit to learning some kind of a skill that gives you some kind

539
00:26:40.16 --> 00:26:42.24
of job security.

540
00:26:42.24 --> 00:26:45.64
And then what are the rules inside that game?

541
00:26:45.64 --> 00:26:49.64
You got some rules like there's actual rules beyond time for work, right?

542
00:26:49.64 --> 00:26:53.72
These are actual rules, but there's a uniform you got to wear.

543
00:26:53.72 --> 00:26:54.72
There's a treatment of others.

544
00:26:54.72 --> 00:26:56.52
You can't use this word or whatever.

545
00:26:56.52 --> 00:26:58.44
The HR will come and get you.

546
00:26:58.44 --> 00:27:01.68
Right?

547
00:27:01.68 --> 00:27:06.04
And then you've got the job itself and the tasks that you've got to complete and the

548
00:27:06.04 --> 00:27:12.32
skills that you've got to learn and the projects that you've got to complete.

549
00:27:12.32 --> 00:27:18.64
And then you've got the game that's going on at work because if you build good relationships

550
00:27:18.64 --> 00:27:22.96
with people, the right people, you can support each other.

551
00:27:22.96 --> 00:27:25.96
And if you're, hey, does that make you an ass kisser?

552
00:27:25.96 --> 00:27:28.20
If you build a good relationship with your boss and you take care of your boss and make

553
00:27:28.20 --> 00:27:29.20
your boss look good.

554
00:27:29.20 --> 00:27:33.16
No, no, actually you're doing a good job and your boss will then most likely take care

555
00:27:33.16 --> 00:27:34.16
of you.

556
00:27:34.16 --> 00:27:35.16
Yeah.

557
00:27:35.16 --> 00:27:39.32
Your, your relation and you brought that up really early where it's like, um, ass kisser,

558
00:27:39.32 --> 00:27:40.32
right?

559
00:27:40.32 --> 00:27:41.32
Like brown nose or whatever.

560
00:27:41.32 --> 00:27:44.20
Like that, just that idea when you say forming a good relationship up the chain.

561
00:27:44.20 --> 00:27:48.24
So you put it in and I'm like, wait a second, like you got to, there's a difference between

562
00:27:48.24 --> 00:27:51.48
being a brown noser and building a good relationship.

563
00:27:51.48 --> 00:27:55.000
So don't think of it as this is what I'm saying in my head, right?

564
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.16
To gain a better understanding of what you're saying.

565
00:27:57.16 --> 00:28:01.24
So building a relationship with someone is just when it's up the chain, down the chain,

566
00:28:01.24 --> 00:28:06.000
your neighbor, your wife, your kids, whatever, it's, it's all essentially the same.

567
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
You do it in different ways.

568
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.96
I mean, different people, different ways, but it's essentially the same approach where

569
00:28:09.96 --> 00:28:13.32
it's like you're, you want to build an actual relationship.

570
00:28:13.32 --> 00:28:14.32
100%.

571
00:28:14.32 --> 00:28:17.64
You're not trying to make them some, you're not trying to please them at every moment

572
00:28:17.64 --> 00:28:18.64
necessarily.

573
00:28:18.64 --> 00:28:23.000
You're trying to build a two way street, good relationship like anything.

574
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.16
So yeah, no one, I don't even think brown nosing is building a good relationship.

575
00:28:28.16 --> 00:28:29.16
Yeah.

576
00:28:29.16 --> 00:28:30.16
Yeah.

577
00:28:30.16 --> 00:28:33.96
Well, there's some people that are, some people that are susceptible, they like to get brown

578
00:28:33.96 --> 00:28:35.24
nosed, right?

579
00:28:35.24 --> 00:28:38.84
But what's funny is like, let's say you're a big brown noser with me and I was the big

580
00:28:38.84 --> 00:28:39.84
boss man.

581
00:28:39.84 --> 00:28:41.24
I actually know you're a brown noser.

582
00:28:41.24 --> 00:28:42.24
I go, I guess he's a brown nose.

583
00:28:42.24 --> 00:28:43.48
He's just trying to kiss my ass.

584
00:28:43.48 --> 00:28:44.48
Exactly right.

585
00:28:44.48 --> 00:28:48.80
And actually you started to say that and I went kind of deep one in a few days anyway,

586
00:28:48.80 --> 00:28:49.80
thinking about that.

587
00:28:49.80 --> 00:28:52.96
Cause I know some brown nosers and some of them are like, man, that guy's so nice.

588
00:28:52.96 --> 00:28:56.72
He's so nice to everybody, but at the same time, like the real, you know, cause the

589
00:28:56.72 --> 00:29:00.04
purpose of building a relationship is to have like, intent has a smell.

590
00:29:00.04 --> 00:29:01.60
So Brad, you don't trust them that much.

591
00:29:01.60 --> 00:29:02.76
You like them.

592
00:29:02.76 --> 00:29:06.76
And then, you know, you'd go into stuff where, um, what's the expression that a good neighbor

593
00:29:06.76 --> 00:29:09.20
or a good Barbie, I don't know, seal teams.

594
00:29:09.20 --> 00:29:10.20
Yeah.

595
00:29:10.20 --> 00:29:12.08
Like it's like that, that like you like them.

596
00:29:12.08 --> 00:29:13.08
Totally like them.

597
00:29:13.08 --> 00:29:14.08
You never do anything mean to this guy.

598
00:29:14.08 --> 00:29:15.08
So nice.

599
00:29:15.08 --> 00:29:18.60
But is that the relationship you want to do?

600
00:29:18.60 --> 00:29:22.60
And that's what I felt about like brown noses or whatever, no matter how nice they are.

601
00:29:22.60 --> 00:29:26.92
So I don't think that's an effective way to build a relationship.

602
00:29:26.92 --> 00:29:28.76
Yeah.

603
00:29:28.76 --> 00:29:35.64
This one of the earlier, I think this was a couple of years ago now, but it's worth

604
00:29:35.64 --> 00:29:39.000
reiterating.

605
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.12
Is this the game you want to play when it comes to work?

606
00:29:41.12 --> 00:29:43.20
Is this the game you want to play?

607
00:29:43.20 --> 00:29:50.48
Because you spend a lot of time with your job and if you hate it, that's not healthy.

608
00:29:50.48 --> 00:29:56.44
You should be playing a game when it comes to work that you like to play.

609
00:29:56.44 --> 00:29:57.44
Right.

610
00:29:57.44 --> 00:30:01.32
So if you like pouring concrete, then that's great.

611
00:30:01.32 --> 00:30:02.84
And you're, and you pour concrete for it.

612
00:30:02.84 --> 00:30:05.08
I mean, think of how awesome that is.

613
00:30:05.08 --> 00:30:11.96
If you like software engineering and you're a software engineer, I mean, it's, hey, if

614
00:30:11.96 --> 00:30:14.16
you like being in the SEAL teams, I was in the SEAL teams.

615
00:30:14.16 --> 00:30:15.36
I love being in the SEAL teams.

616
00:30:15.36 --> 00:30:16.36
What a freaking great job.

617
00:30:16.36 --> 00:30:19.52
I didn't, I never went to work a day in my life.

618
00:30:19.52 --> 00:30:23.76
So, do you want to actually play this game?

619
00:30:23.76 --> 00:30:26.56
Is something you should assess?

620
00:30:26.56 --> 00:30:29.48
And by the way, we're going to get this on all aspects of this, right?

621
00:30:29.48 --> 00:30:31.20
Because you're going to be in relationship games.

622
00:30:31.20 --> 00:30:32.88
Do you want to be in that relationship game?

623
00:30:32.88 --> 00:30:40.08
You're going to be in life games that do you want to be playing that particular field?

624
00:30:40.08 --> 00:30:44.04
But for work is what you're doing gratifying.

625
00:30:44.04 --> 00:30:45.24
Is it gratifying to you?

626
00:30:45.24 --> 00:30:48.72
Do you get done with a day and say, damn, that was a good day.

627
00:30:48.72 --> 00:30:50.96
I really got a lot of, I made progress.

628
00:30:50.96 --> 00:30:52.76
I made the world a little bit better today.

629
00:30:52.76 --> 00:30:54.20
I made my world a little bit better.

630
00:30:54.20 --> 00:30:56.44
I made my clients world a little bit better.

631
00:30:56.44 --> 00:30:59.84
I made the highway a little bit better, pouring concrete.

632
00:30:59.84 --> 00:31:01.64
Like, what are you doing?

633
00:31:01.64 --> 00:31:04.20
Are you proud of it?

634
00:31:04.20 --> 00:31:11.48
And then, and this is the thing that came up a couple of years ago, does this game score

635
00:31:11.48 --> 00:31:13.16
the way you want it to score?

636
00:31:13.16 --> 00:31:21.16
And what came up with, I had two friends that were both working two extremely capable friends,

637
00:31:21.16 --> 00:31:28.80
meaning extremely smart, charismatic, you know, just good, really good, both of them

638
00:31:28.80 --> 00:31:33.84
were men, really good guys, both extremely hard workers.

639
00:31:33.84 --> 00:31:38.60
These are 70, 80 hour a week people, 100 hour a week, whatever is needed.

640
00:31:38.60 --> 00:31:47.20
And they were both capped out from a financial income perspective, meaning they were making

641
00:31:47.20 --> 00:31:52.04
as much money as they could make playing that game.

642
00:31:52.04 --> 00:31:55.56
And the way I explained it to both of them, luckily I had the two conversations within

643
00:31:55.56 --> 00:32:01.48
a couple of weeks of each other, but it's like you could be the best soccer player in

644
00:32:01.48 --> 00:32:06.20
the world and how many soccer goals could you score a game?

645
00:32:06.20 --> 00:32:08.16
Maybe one, maybe two.

646
00:32:08.16 --> 00:32:13.76
Maybe, but if you're a basketball player, you might be scoring 30, 40, 50 points a game.

647
00:32:13.76 --> 00:32:22.28
Well, there's some jobs that you work an 80 hour week and you make $64,000 a year.

648
00:32:22.28 --> 00:32:24.52
Those jobs exist for real.

649
00:32:24.52 --> 00:32:30.20
There's jobs that work, you work 20 hours a week and you make $500,000 a year.

650
00:32:30.20 --> 00:32:35.76
So if you work 100 hours a week, you're going to make, you know, multiples more than that.

651
00:32:35.76 --> 00:32:43.36
So figure out if the game that you're in from a job perspective, write it down.

652
00:32:43.36 --> 00:32:45.000
Is this the game I want to be in?

653
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.32
What are the objectives?

654
00:32:46.32 --> 00:32:48.76
How many points can I score?

655
00:32:48.76 --> 00:32:50.24
Is it worth my time?

656
00:32:50.24 --> 00:32:52.76
Like Echo is sitting around as a bouncer at 23 years old.

657
00:32:52.76 --> 00:32:54.84
It's like, okay, hey, this is fun.

658
00:32:54.84 --> 00:32:59.12
But as soon as you take a step back and say, wait, is this gratifying?

659
00:32:59.12 --> 00:33:01.64
Wait a second, how much money can I make?

660
00:33:01.64 --> 00:33:04.68
And part of the way we're keeping score is money.

661
00:33:04.68 --> 00:33:09.04
So if I can't make a ton of money and I can't really progress, what am I doing on the field

662
00:33:09.04 --> 00:33:10.04
right now?

663
00:33:10.04 --> 00:33:12.40
Why am I playing this game?

664
00:33:12.40 --> 00:33:17.12
So when it comes to work, ask yourself that question.

665
00:33:17.12 --> 00:33:19.44
Ask yourself all these questions.

666
00:33:19.44 --> 00:33:24.60
Is this the game you want to play from an employment, from a job, from an entrepreneurial

667
00:33:24.60 --> 00:33:25.68
perspective?

668
00:33:25.68 --> 00:33:27.28
Is this the game you want to play?

669
00:33:27.28 --> 00:33:34.16
Now we're talking about health, which is what's interesting about health is you don't have

670
00:33:34.16 --> 00:33:36.72
to follow any of the rules.

671
00:33:36.72 --> 00:33:38.20
No one's going to enforce the rules on you.

672
00:33:38.20 --> 00:33:42.72
I mean, you can get addicted to heroin and you can literally do heroin until you die.

673
00:33:42.72 --> 00:33:47.68
That's, that's, you can do that.

674
00:33:47.68 --> 00:33:50.20
But there are rules that we know you can follow.

675
00:33:50.20 --> 00:33:52.92
You know, you can follow good, healthy diet.

676
00:33:52.92 --> 00:33:55.44
You can follow exercise.

677
00:33:55.44 --> 00:33:59.48
You can do the proper amount of rest and recovery.

678
00:33:59.48 --> 00:34:05.96
And if you don't know that you're playing a game there, you're going to have problems.

679
00:34:05.96 --> 00:34:07.92
Relationships.

680
00:34:07.92 --> 00:34:12.12
So at Eshalon Front, last couple of years, I've been talking a lot about relationships

681
00:34:12.12 --> 00:34:13.92
and what a relationship is.

682
00:34:13.92 --> 00:34:17.60
And what a relationship is to me is trust, listen, respect and influence.

683
00:34:17.60 --> 00:34:22.68
Meaning, if you and I don't trust each other, there's no relationship.

684
00:34:22.68 --> 00:34:25.20
If you and I don't listen to each other, there's no relationship.

685
00:34:25.20 --> 00:34:27.36
If you and I don't respect each other, there's no relationship.

686
00:34:27.36 --> 00:34:30.12
If you and I have no influence over each other, there's no relationship.

687
00:34:30.12 --> 00:34:33.92
But if we do trust each other, if we do listen to each other, if we do respect each other,

688
00:34:33.92 --> 00:34:36.48
if we do influence each other, then we got a relationship.

689
00:34:36.48 --> 00:34:42.52
And obviously there's a whole bunch of shades of gray in their different gradients of how

690
00:34:42.52 --> 00:34:44.96
strong our relationship is.

691
00:34:44.96 --> 00:34:47.68
But that's what, that's what we're dealing with.

692
00:34:47.68 --> 00:34:53.84
So you got friends.

693
00:34:53.84 --> 00:34:57.48
You want to have, you want to build friendships.

694
00:34:57.48 --> 00:35:01.24
You want to build good relationship friendships.

695
00:35:01.24 --> 00:35:05.68
You know, there's a, I think the movie is called The Town where the dude comes in and

696
00:35:05.68 --> 00:35:07.40
he's like, hey, we're going to go somewhere.

697
00:35:07.40 --> 00:35:10.16
We're going to hurt some people and we can never talk about it again.

698
00:35:10.16 --> 00:35:13.36
And the dude looks back at him and says, who's car we taking?

699
00:35:13.36 --> 00:35:15.32
You kind of want some friends like that, right?

700
00:35:15.32 --> 00:35:17.92
That's the kind of friends you want.

701
00:35:17.92 --> 00:35:21.44
You also want to have a friend that's like, hey, bro, is this a good move that we're

702
00:35:21.44 --> 00:35:22.56
about to make?

703
00:35:22.56 --> 00:35:23.56
Is it worth the risk?

704
00:35:23.56 --> 00:35:24.80
What are we doing it for?

705
00:35:24.80 --> 00:35:25.80
Is this your ego?

706
00:35:25.80 --> 00:35:26.80
Are you just emotional right now?

707
00:35:26.80 --> 00:35:27.80
You see what I'm saying?

708
00:35:27.80 --> 00:35:31.32
You want to have somebody that's going to push back against your, your, your, what you consider

709
00:35:31.32 --> 00:35:33.88
to be your good ideas.

710
00:35:33.88 --> 00:35:43.08
You want to make sure that your friends really want the best for you.

711
00:35:43.08 --> 00:35:44.64
They like it when you win.

712
00:35:44.64 --> 00:35:46.64
They love it when you win.

713
00:35:46.64 --> 00:35:49.72
They like it more when you win than when they win, right?

714
00:35:49.72 --> 00:35:52.56
That's always nice.

715
00:35:52.56 --> 00:35:55.92
It's always nice when you've got a friend that says, oh, you're winning and they're

716
00:35:55.92 --> 00:35:57.44
happy.

717
00:35:57.44 --> 00:36:02.96
It's so bizarre that you can have friends that when you win, they don't like it.

718
00:36:02.96 --> 00:36:05.68
Bro, it's spooky.

719
00:36:05.68 --> 00:36:07.68
And it's not just friends too.

720
00:36:07.68 --> 00:36:11.80
Like, you know, if you come across a family scenario where, you know, it's revealed to

721
00:36:11.80 --> 00:36:18.28
you that, you know, maybe they're not as supportive, you know, yeah, it's, uh, it's bizarre for

722
00:36:18.28 --> 00:36:22.16
sure, but it's like kind of spooky because, you know, like someone's your friend and maybe,

723
00:36:22.16 --> 00:36:27.80
you know, in under certain circumstance, like you've only been through so many things with

724
00:36:27.80 --> 00:36:29.24
them a lot for sure.

725
00:36:29.24 --> 00:36:32.92
But let's say there's certain circumstances you haven't been in with them, then they get

726
00:36:32.92 --> 00:36:36.44
revealed to be, you know, like an easy one, an easy one.

727
00:36:36.44 --> 00:36:42.000
Like if something good happens to you, like big major life thing, you know, and then you

728
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.64
could tell they're not happy.

729
00:36:43.64 --> 00:36:47.88
Like, damn this whole fucking time you've been feeling that way.

730
00:36:47.88 --> 00:36:50.04
You know, like, bro, it's bad, man.

731
00:36:50.04 --> 00:36:51.04
Yeah.

732
00:36:51.04 --> 00:36:56.04
I mean, you know, when, when I got my house and Stoner came up, like I had a couple of

733
00:36:56.04 --> 00:37:02.76
friends come over when I first got my house and the house where I live now.

734
00:37:02.76 --> 00:37:05.76
And it's, it's, it's in an optimal spot.

735
00:37:05.76 --> 00:37:06.76
Let's say, right?

736
00:37:06.76 --> 00:37:07.76
I would agree with that.

737
00:37:07.76 --> 00:37:11.60
It's an optimal position geographically on earth.

738
00:37:11.60 --> 00:37:12.88
Hell yeah.

739
00:37:12.88 --> 00:37:18.28
And like the first guy that came over was like, Oh, I forget what the little criticism

740
00:37:18.28 --> 00:37:21.20
he made, but it was some devastating in his mind.

741
00:37:21.20 --> 00:37:26.20
You know, oh, this salt water is going to eat everything.

742
00:37:26.20 --> 00:37:32.20
You know, like that was like for him, bro, I'd be like, how could you even live here?

743
00:37:32.20 --> 00:37:36.72
The salt spray from the ocean is going to really damage your whole life.

744
00:37:36.72 --> 00:37:37.72
Yeah.

745
00:37:37.72 --> 00:37:38.72
Your whole life.

746
00:37:38.72 --> 00:37:39.96
I'm like, bro, you know, I'll rotate some gear out.

747
00:37:39.96 --> 00:37:41.40
I think I'll be all right.

748
00:37:41.40 --> 00:37:46.44
But that, and I saw, I had several people hit me with that negativity.

749
00:37:46.44 --> 00:37:52.20
When I came over like he showed up, he's like, bro, we are so, he's calling it weed.

750
00:37:52.20 --> 00:37:53.72
We got this.

751
00:37:53.72 --> 00:37:54.72
Right?

752
00:37:54.72 --> 00:37:59.52
We kind of, we kind of actually, but, but what a crazy thing to think about.

753
00:37:59.52 --> 00:38:05.32
So when we talk about these relationships as being a game, well, if you got a friend

754
00:38:05.32 --> 00:38:07.60
that doesn't want you to win, you're not winning the game.

755
00:38:07.60 --> 00:38:08.60
Yeah.

756
00:38:08.60 --> 00:38:11.56
If you've got friends that are supportive of you or doing everything they're going to

757
00:38:11.56 --> 00:38:16.40
help you, you got, you're winning the game.

758
00:38:16.40 --> 00:38:21.24
Same thing with your, you know, your, your relationship, whether it's a spouse, whether

759
00:38:21.24 --> 00:38:24.04
it's a girlfriend, boyfriend type scenario.

760
00:38:24.04 --> 00:38:31.48
This is sort of your business partner in life, in, in, in a lot of aspects of your life.

761
00:38:31.48 --> 00:38:36.60
So what kind of trust, what kind of, you know, respect do you have for each other?

762
00:38:36.60 --> 00:38:37.96
How much do you influence each other?

763
00:38:37.96 --> 00:38:40.44
How much do you listen to each other?

764
00:38:40.44 --> 00:38:41.44
Where are you at?

765
00:38:41.44 --> 00:38:45.28
Cause if you got a spouse that you don't respect, you're not winning the game.

766
00:38:45.28 --> 00:38:47.24
If they don't respect you, you're not winning, if they don't listen to you, they're not

767
00:38:47.24 --> 00:38:48.24
winning the game.

768
00:38:48.24 --> 00:38:49.40
If you don't listen to them, like those are all things.

769
00:38:49.40 --> 00:38:54.24
So if you don't understand that, if you don't understand that that's part of the game that

770
00:38:54.24 --> 00:38:56.96
you're playing, you're going to lose the game.

771
00:38:56.96 --> 00:38:58.76
You're going to lose the game.

772
00:38:58.76 --> 00:39:00.16
We got kids, right?

773
00:39:00.16 --> 00:39:03.64
You start having kids.

774
00:39:03.64 --> 00:39:07.36
That's part of the scenario too.

775
00:39:07.36 --> 00:39:12.76
And so then there's, there's influences that you have on your kids and what influences

776
00:39:12.76 --> 00:39:14.80
are you having on them?

777
00:39:14.80 --> 00:39:17.08
And are they negative or are they positive?

778
00:39:17.08 --> 00:39:21.32
And if you don't understand, if you're not paying attention to that, if you're not watching

779
00:39:21.32 --> 00:39:27.40
it, all of a sudden you look up and you've made some major mistakes and you got a kid

780
00:39:27.40 --> 00:39:33.04
running off the rails over here.

781
00:39:33.04 --> 00:39:38.72
So when it comes to this relational aspect thing of friends, of spouses, of girlfriends,

782
00:39:38.72 --> 00:39:42.24
of boyfriends, of kids, by the way, kids, same thing.

783
00:39:42.24 --> 00:39:43.24
You want them to listen to you?

784
00:39:43.24 --> 00:39:44.24
Listen to them.

785
00:39:44.24 --> 00:39:45.24
You want them to trust you?

786
00:39:45.24 --> 00:39:46.36
You have to trust them.

787
00:39:46.36 --> 00:39:47.80
You want them to treat you with respect?

788
00:39:47.80 --> 00:39:51.48
You better treat them with respect.

789
00:39:51.48 --> 00:39:57.08
To cast all this away by saying like, you know, the classic expression, I'm sure you've

790
00:39:57.08 --> 00:40:00.96
said it to a bunch of young ladies in your day.

791
00:40:00.96 --> 00:40:02.52
Stop playing games with me.

792
00:40:02.52 --> 00:40:04.96
No, I'll put it in the back.

793
00:40:04.96 --> 00:40:09.76
But you know, you know the, that's, that's like a common phrase, you know, like a really

794
00:40:09.76 --> 00:40:13.12
negative like, oh, stop playing games with me.

795
00:40:13.12 --> 00:40:19.16
And if you view this idea of playing a game with relationships, just from the fact that

796
00:40:19.16 --> 00:40:22.92
you like playing a game and manipulating, of course it's a negative connotation.

797
00:40:22.92 --> 00:40:25.52
But if you look at the game is to build bonds.

798
00:40:25.52 --> 00:40:27.48
If you look at the game is to build trust.

799
00:40:27.48 --> 00:40:33.40
If you look at the game to build a true partner in life, then it's a positive thing.

800
00:40:33.40 --> 00:40:34.40
Yeah.

801
00:40:34.40 --> 00:40:42.16
Yeah, the, you bring that up where the courting phase in a relationship, right?

802
00:40:42.16 --> 00:40:46.64
Being in that part, the courting part of it, it's like, there's that big game that you're

803
00:40:46.64 --> 00:40:51.04
talking about, but then there's a couple of, maybe two levels of psychological game within

804
00:40:51.04 --> 00:40:52.04
the game.

805
00:40:52.04 --> 00:40:56.84
So, and there are rules just, and there are like ways to score and all this other stuff.

806
00:40:56.84 --> 00:41:00.08
Like, and it kind of is like an actual game in that way.

807
00:41:00.08 --> 00:41:01.08
Yes.

808
00:41:01.08 --> 00:41:02.08
But it is for the good.

809
00:41:02.08 --> 00:41:03.24
It's for the greater good.

810
00:41:03.24 --> 00:41:05.20
And that's what you have to look at.

811
00:41:05.20 --> 00:41:09.36
Is your end goal to manipulate some of the person?

812
00:41:09.36 --> 00:41:10.36
Right.

813
00:41:10.36 --> 00:41:11.92
Then it's, then you're playing the wrong game.

814
00:41:11.92 --> 00:41:12.92
Yeah.

815
00:41:12.92 --> 00:41:19.32
Hey, I can say that, that ultimately you may get a short term gratification, but ultimately

816
00:41:19.32 --> 00:41:21.52
you're playing the wrong game.

817
00:41:21.52 --> 00:41:24.24
If your goal is to manipulate someone, take advantage of them.

818
00:41:24.24 --> 00:41:25.92
Listen, you might win a short term game.

819
00:41:25.92 --> 00:41:28.16
Oh, I got this girl to do this for me.

820
00:41:28.16 --> 00:41:29.16
Yeah.

821
00:41:29.16 --> 00:41:30.16
Where you're going to be long term.

822
00:41:30.16 --> 00:41:31.16
Yeah.

823
00:41:31.16 --> 00:41:33.92
That's why you have to take a step back and write down what it is you're trying to achieve.

824
00:41:33.92 --> 00:41:37.000
Because you go through a bunch of hollow relationships like that.

825
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.28
You haven't progressed in life.

826
00:41:38.28 --> 00:41:39.28
Yeah.

827
00:41:39.28 --> 00:41:40.76
And you end up with a bunch of baggage.

828
00:41:40.76 --> 00:41:41.76
Yeah.

829
00:41:41.76 --> 00:41:44.96
And that's not going to help you.

830
00:41:44.96 --> 00:41:47.32
We're playing a game, not a manipulation.

831
00:41:47.32 --> 00:41:48.32
That's not what we're talking about.

832
00:41:48.32 --> 00:41:51.56
Like there's a, there's like a famous book that's called The Game, right?

833
00:41:51.56 --> 00:41:52.56
Yeah.

834
00:41:52.56 --> 00:41:53.56
It's like a pickup artist book.

835
00:41:53.56 --> 00:41:54.56
Oh, for real.

836
00:41:54.56 --> 00:41:55.56
And it's called The Game.

837
00:41:55.56 --> 00:41:56.56
Okay.

838
00:41:56.56 --> 00:41:57.56
And that's like one of those things.

839
00:41:57.56 --> 00:41:59.08
It's like, oh, if you say this, you act this way.

840
00:41:59.08 --> 00:42:06.08
It's like giving pointers to guys so they can go and manipulate girls into basically,

841
00:42:06.08 --> 00:42:07.68
you know, sleeping with them.

842
00:42:07.68 --> 00:42:08.68
Yeah.

843
00:42:08.68 --> 00:42:09.68
Yeah.

844
00:42:09.68 --> 00:42:10.68
I'm pretty sure.

845
00:42:10.68 --> 00:42:12.48
And that's what it is.

846
00:42:12.48 --> 00:42:16.72
So that's a, not what we're talking about.

847
00:42:16.72 --> 00:42:19.84
And look, that could be a game that you're playing when you're 23 years old.

848
00:42:19.84 --> 00:42:20.84
Yeah.

849
00:42:20.84 --> 00:42:21.84
Right?

850
00:42:21.84 --> 00:42:22.84
You could be playing that game.

851
00:42:22.84 --> 00:42:27.28
But if you're playing that game right now at 23 years old, take a step back and figure

852
00:42:27.28 --> 00:42:30.48
out where that's going to put you in the long run.

853
00:42:30.48 --> 00:42:32.84
That's what you need to figure out.

854
00:42:32.84 --> 00:42:38.68
Because there's a bigger, more superior game that you should be playing.

855
00:42:38.68 --> 00:42:42.16
And think about that.

856
00:42:42.16 --> 00:42:50.96
The other game that we're dealing with is, is everyone's dealing with is your mental

857
00:42:50.96 --> 00:42:54.96
health.

858
00:42:54.96 --> 00:42:58.76
Which in my opinion, it's kind of rooted in everything we just talked about, like physical

859
00:42:58.76 --> 00:42:59.76
health.

860
00:42:59.76 --> 00:43:00.76
Right?

861
00:43:00.76 --> 00:43:07.52
If you're not physically healthy, it's going to be harder for you to keep your mental health

862
00:43:07.52 --> 00:43:09.72
on peak, right?

863
00:43:09.72 --> 00:43:11.44
On point.

864
00:43:11.44 --> 00:43:12.84
Your job gratification, right?

865
00:43:12.84 --> 00:43:16.56
If you're miserable at work, what does that do to you for mental health?

866
00:43:16.56 --> 00:43:21.96
If you're, if you're miserable all day long, that's not beneficial to your mental health.

867
00:43:21.96 --> 00:43:27.32
If you are in bad relationships, that's not beneficial for your mental health.

868
00:43:27.32 --> 00:43:32.32
So all these things are impacting your mental health.

869
00:43:32.32 --> 00:43:44.64
One thing that I've noticed is that a big part from what I've seen, a big part of mental

870
00:43:44.64 --> 00:43:54.32
health and being a good place from a mental health perspective is taking ownership.

871
00:43:54.32 --> 00:44:03.32
And I've found that people who take ownership of their actions have better mental health.

872
00:44:03.32 --> 00:44:13.000
And obviously this falls into right in line with the book Extreme Ownership.

873
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.20
But when I look, how many people have I met over the last 10 years?

874
00:44:18.20 --> 00:44:22.60
Or I guess when did Extreme Ownership came out in 2015?

875
00:44:22.60 --> 00:44:24.20
It's 2022 right now.

876
00:44:24.20 --> 00:44:31.56
So the past seven years, how many people have I met that have, for lack of a better phrase,

877
00:44:31.56 --> 00:44:35.24
turned their lives around from a mental health perspective by taking ownership of what's

878
00:44:35.24 --> 00:44:36.32
going on in their world?

879
00:44:36.32 --> 00:44:38.36
By saying, oh, because guess what?

880
00:44:38.36 --> 00:44:40.88
How do you get bad physical health?

881
00:44:40.88 --> 00:44:42.16
You don't take ownership of your health.

882
00:44:42.16 --> 00:44:46.20
You blame the work, you blame the time, you blame the this, you blame the, you just say,

883
00:44:46.20 --> 00:44:51.56
you know, how do you take ownership of your, how do you have bad satisfaction at work?

884
00:44:51.56 --> 00:44:55.72
Oh, you blame other people and you don't get promoted because you don't think that anyone

885
00:44:55.72 --> 00:44:58.68
likes you because it's all their fault.

886
00:44:58.68 --> 00:44:59.96
How do you end up in a bad relationship?

887
00:44:59.96 --> 00:45:02.76
Well, you go, oh, I ended up here and now I can't get out.

888
00:45:02.76 --> 00:45:06.32
It's like, no, people that take ownership of what's going on.

889
00:45:06.32 --> 00:45:10.56
And by the way, when you say, oh, yeah, you know, I got a DUI and I lost my license and

890
00:45:10.56 --> 00:45:13.92
that made me lose my job and my life sucks now.

891
00:45:13.92 --> 00:45:15.32
Okay.

892
00:45:15.32 --> 00:45:16.68
The person that goes, yep, you know what?

893
00:45:16.68 --> 00:45:18.48
I really screwed up.

894
00:45:18.48 --> 00:45:19.48
Here's what I did.

895
00:45:19.48 --> 00:45:21.52
I went, you know, I got a DUI and I lost my job.

896
00:45:21.52 --> 00:45:23.08
Here's what I'm doing now.

897
00:45:23.08 --> 00:45:24.08
That's my fault.

898
00:45:24.08 --> 00:45:25.16
Obviously I stopped drinking.

899
00:45:25.16 --> 00:45:26.72
I'm never drinking again.

900
00:45:26.72 --> 00:45:27.72
Here's my new job.

901
00:45:27.72 --> 00:45:33.12
It's low paying, but I know that there's a path for me to, you know, promote over time.

902
00:45:33.12 --> 00:45:34.12
Here's the way I'm getting around.

903
00:45:34.12 --> 00:45:37.96
I went and got an e-bike, you know, and now I can get to this new job I have.

904
00:45:37.96 --> 00:45:45.68
So people that take ownership of what's going on in their world are absolutely going to have,

905
00:45:45.68 --> 00:45:48.88
in my opinion, better mental health.

906
00:45:48.88 --> 00:45:53.08
And this is something that I've seen a lot of.

907
00:45:53.08 --> 00:45:58.000
And I've seen it help so many people.

908
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.04
I've seen it help so many people to say, oh, yeah, I had this, you know, my mom got sick,

909
00:46:03.04 --> 00:46:07.88
my dad got sick, my kid got sick, my job got lost, like all those problems and going, okay,

910
00:46:07.88 --> 00:46:08.88
here's what I can do about it.

911
00:46:08.88 --> 00:46:09.88
Here's how I can fix it.

912
00:46:09.88 --> 00:46:12.000
Here's how I can move forward.

913
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.16
And you know that, that one about the mom getting sick, about the dad getting sick, about the

914
00:46:15.16 --> 00:46:16.92
kid getting sick.

915
00:46:16.92 --> 00:46:21.40
And you take that, oh, well, now there's, I'm, you know, woe is me.

916
00:46:21.40 --> 00:46:27.64
And believe me, look, I've talked to countless people that have been in that situation.

917
00:46:27.64 --> 00:46:28.64
My kid got sick.

918
00:46:28.64 --> 00:46:33.52
I mean, I'm talking like bad diseases, cancer, like serious diseases.

919
00:46:33.52 --> 00:46:37.48
The ones that say, oh, yeah, this is what, this is what hit me.

920
00:46:37.48 --> 00:46:39.80
This is what hit my family.

921
00:46:39.80 --> 00:46:42.56
Here's how I went on offense.

922
00:46:42.56 --> 00:46:43.56
Here's what I did.

923
00:46:43.56 --> 00:46:45.28
And said, oh, I can't believe this happened to me.

924
00:46:45.28 --> 00:46:48.96
When people take ownership of how they respond to things, it helps their mental health so

925
00:46:48.96 --> 00:46:51.60
much just like taking action.

926
00:46:51.60 --> 00:46:57.24
Being on offense instead of being on defense is so much better for your mindset.

927
00:46:57.24 --> 00:47:03.76
And if you go through life, not taking ownership, being a victim of what's happening to you,

928
00:47:03.76 --> 00:47:08.64
it's much harder on your mental health than saying, okay, got dealt a bad hand.

929
00:47:08.64 --> 00:47:09.88
Here's what I'm going to do.

930
00:47:09.88 --> 00:47:15.56
Do you feel like it's like a control thing, like, you know how, and you say this where

931
00:47:15.56 --> 00:47:19.60
it's like the, the, the, the big motivator, if not the biggest motivator for people is

932
00:47:19.60 --> 00:47:21.40
controlling their own destiny.

933
00:47:21.40 --> 00:47:29.32
So is on a, like for lack of a term on a fundamental level, isn't that kind of what it comes down

934
00:47:29.32 --> 00:47:30.76
to like control?

935
00:47:30.76 --> 00:47:35.000
Like if something, if life is happening to someone, they feel they're not in control,

936
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.76
all these bad things and they're not in control.

937
00:47:36.76 --> 00:47:38.80
If they were, they wouldn't happen, you know?

938
00:47:38.80 --> 00:47:44.92
But they're just essentially like missing the idea that you are in control of a bunch

939
00:47:44.92 --> 00:47:45.92
of things.

940
00:47:45.92 --> 00:47:48.40
You're kind of not in control of a bunch of things.

941
00:47:48.40 --> 00:47:49.40
For sure.

942
00:47:49.40 --> 00:47:50.40
There's things you can't control.

943
00:47:50.40 --> 00:47:51.40
Yeah.

944
00:47:51.40 --> 00:47:54.44
And then using the things you can't control to control the situation kind of thing.

945
00:47:54.44 --> 00:47:57.28
And usually there were just blier.

946
00:47:57.28 --> 00:48:01.24
And I'm trying to think of any situation where I was like unhappy or whatever.

947
00:48:01.24 --> 00:48:03.92
It's like, you're just more blind to it.

948
00:48:03.92 --> 00:48:05.36
It's not that they're not there.

949
00:48:05.36 --> 00:48:06.60
Like the elements you can control.

950
00:48:06.60 --> 00:48:10.28
You're just blind to the idea that, hey, you can control this whole thing.

951
00:48:10.28 --> 00:48:14.64
And then when you kind of go from there and this is kind of what I'm kind of hopefully

952
00:48:14.64 --> 00:48:19.12
kind of figuring out where that's where the ownership comes in.

953
00:48:19.12 --> 00:48:20.12
Yeah.

954
00:48:20.12 --> 00:48:24.28
For it's like, hey, this mistake, because you start, if you start blaming other people,

955
00:48:24.28 --> 00:48:26.72
you automatically kind of relinquish control of everything.

956
00:48:26.72 --> 00:48:27.72
Yes.

957
00:48:27.72 --> 00:48:29.16
Where it's like, hey, this thing messed up.

958
00:48:29.16 --> 00:48:30.16
It's not my fault.

959
00:48:30.16 --> 00:48:31.16
You know, like it's too bad.

960
00:48:31.16 --> 00:48:33.76
It's like, you know, out of my control, but now everything looking forward is not your

961
00:48:33.76 --> 00:48:34.76
control either.

962
00:48:34.76 --> 00:48:40.16
But if you look at it like the opposite way, you're kind of like, oh wait, I can control

963
00:48:40.16 --> 00:48:45.64
the outcome, you know, take ownership of how you respond to things for sure.

964
00:48:45.64 --> 00:48:49.60
So you get horrible news and you take ownership of how you respond to it.

965
00:48:49.60 --> 00:48:53.68
There are absolutely things in the world that you cannot control.

966
00:48:53.68 --> 00:48:57.44
There's absolutely things in the world that you cannot control.

967
00:48:57.44 --> 00:48:58.44
Absolutely.

968
00:48:58.44 --> 00:48:59.44
Of course.

969
00:48:59.44 --> 00:49:02.16
And then it's like, okay, how, what can I control?

970
00:49:02.16 --> 00:49:07.12
Let me focus on the things I can control and then move forward to the best of my ability

971
00:49:07.12 --> 00:49:11.56
and respond to whatever thing I can control in the best possible way.

972
00:49:11.56 --> 00:49:18.24
And if you don't do that, then you're just on defense and being on defense is like,

973
00:49:18.24 --> 00:49:24.64
you know, imagine you're a, imagine you're a mouse in a cage, in a, in a, let's say in

974
00:49:24.64 --> 00:49:27.64
a room and there's a cat in there.

975
00:49:27.64 --> 00:49:31.20
Well, let's say there's three of you mice and there's a cat in there.

976
00:49:31.20 --> 00:49:32.20
How do you feel?

977
00:49:32.20 --> 00:49:34.84
Like you're constantly scared.

978
00:49:34.84 --> 00:49:36.44
You're constantly reacting.

979
00:49:36.44 --> 00:49:37.44
You have no control.

980
00:49:37.44 --> 00:49:40.12
If you're the cat, you're kind of like good to go.

981
00:49:40.12 --> 00:49:41.12
Right?

982
00:49:41.12 --> 00:49:45.44
He's walking around, you know, like looking for food, looking for dinner.

983
00:49:45.44 --> 00:49:47.52
And so what are you going to do?

984
00:49:47.52 --> 00:49:48.92
You going to be the cat, you're going to be the mouse.

985
00:49:48.92 --> 00:49:52.20
You're going to be the predator, you're going to be the prey.

986
00:49:52.20 --> 00:49:56.20
And if you're a mouse and you're in that room, instead of going, well, this is horrible,

987
00:49:56.20 --> 00:50:01.44
why couldn't I be a big, you know, 12 pound animal with claws and teeth?

988
00:50:01.44 --> 00:50:02.80
And said, you're like, Hey, you know what?

989
00:50:02.80 --> 00:50:07.32
I can't be a big animal, but you know what I can do is dig a little hole through this

990
00:50:07.32 --> 00:50:09.84
wall, part of the wall, and I can have a place to hide.

991
00:50:09.84 --> 00:50:11.84
And that way this guy can't get me.

992
00:50:11.84 --> 00:50:13.88
And then good, I got control now.

993
00:50:13.88 --> 00:50:16.44
And by the way, inside this wall, we got some installation in there.

994
00:50:16.44 --> 00:50:19.36
We're going to build some nice beds and we're going to make a little life for us.

995
00:50:19.36 --> 00:50:20.52
You know what I'm saying?

996
00:50:20.52 --> 00:50:22.92
So there's a different attitude.

997
00:50:22.92 --> 00:50:24.20
When you take on, what can you control?

998
00:50:24.20 --> 00:50:29.36
Oh, I can burrow into this wall a little bit and I can actually get control inside behind

999
00:50:29.36 --> 00:50:32.04
this thing and I won't let this cat in here and we're good to go.

1000
00:50:32.04 --> 00:50:33.04
Yeah.

1001
00:50:33.04 --> 00:50:37.28
Man, that's, that hits me a lot when I get injured where, you know, when you first get

1002
00:50:37.28 --> 00:50:41.20
injured, you're like, never did you get socks this whole time.

1003
00:50:41.20 --> 00:50:43.84
I can't go train for high and you have to say, how long is it?

1004
00:50:43.84 --> 00:50:46.96
Oh, freaking, you know, it's six, eight months or you're like, Oh my gosh, it's the end of

1005
00:50:46.96 --> 00:50:47.96
the world.

1006
00:50:47.96 --> 00:50:51.12
It's six, eight months is a long time, especially when it's not like you literally do not have

1007
00:50:51.12 --> 00:50:53.08
the option to go train six, eight months.

1008
00:50:53.08 --> 00:50:55.32
I've never been through that actually.

1009
00:50:55.32 --> 00:50:56.32
Yeah.

1010
00:50:56.32 --> 00:51:00.64
So, but I also think too, lifting like, bro, I can't lift like how, look, if I have a torn

1011
00:51:00.64 --> 00:51:05.40
bicep toward ACL, torn, whatever, it's like, bro, I can never, I can't do squats anymore

1012
00:51:05.40 --> 00:51:06.40
or bicep.

1013
00:51:06.40 --> 00:51:11.60
I can, not only can I not do curls end of the world, by the way, I can't do shoulder

1014
00:51:11.60 --> 00:51:12.60
break, I can't do bent.

1015
00:51:12.60 --> 00:51:14.36
There's a lot that your biceps do, you know?

1016
00:51:14.36 --> 00:51:17.28
So in your mind, you're like, I can't do any, like I can't lift.

1017
00:51:17.28 --> 00:51:18.76
Why even like, what am I going to do?

1018
00:51:18.76 --> 00:51:19.96
Do half jumping jack?

1019
00:51:19.96 --> 00:51:21.68
Like it doesn't make sense.

1020
00:51:21.68 --> 00:51:26.48
But if you for real think like, hey, no, anything regarding my bicep in any kind of intensity

1021
00:51:26.48 --> 00:51:27.48
or whatever.

1022
00:51:27.48 --> 00:51:28.48
Sure.

1023
00:51:28.48 --> 00:51:29.48
We can't control that right now.

1024
00:51:29.48 --> 00:51:31.80
It'll come back, but we can't control that right now.

1025
00:51:31.80 --> 00:51:34.12
We're going to do literally everything else as hard as we can.

1026
00:51:34.12 --> 00:51:37.000
Bro, you'd be surprised how much good stuff you can get.

1027
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.36
In fact, you said, you mentioned this.

1028
00:51:41.36 --> 00:51:43.16
You probably don't know the impact it had on me.

1029
00:51:43.16 --> 00:51:44.16
Maybe feel real good.

1030
00:51:44.16 --> 00:51:49.44
But remember last time I tore my bicep, the second one, I was like, I forget exactly how

1031
00:51:49.44 --> 00:51:53.12
I phrase it, but I was like, Hey, can you even tell that this is this has been torn?

1032
00:51:53.12 --> 00:51:55.12
Because the first one, my whole arm was like a noodle.

1033
00:51:55.12 --> 00:51:59.32
Cause I kind of, I didn't approach it the same way I approached this last one.

1034
00:51:59.32 --> 00:52:03.72
But I was like, can you even tell you're like, you're like, oh yeah, I just figured you're

1035
00:52:03.72 --> 00:52:04.72
you know, whatever.

1036
00:52:04.72 --> 00:52:07.64
Like you made a joke first, but then you're like, no, actually I can't really tell at

1037
00:52:07.64 --> 00:52:08.64
all.

1038
00:52:08.64 --> 00:52:11.36
Aside from the bandage that I wore for the first week, like you're like, oh, I can't

1039
00:52:11.36 --> 00:52:12.36
do this.

1040
00:52:12.36 --> 00:52:13.96
After you had surgery, after I had surgery.

1041
00:52:13.96 --> 00:52:14.96
Yeah.

1042
00:52:14.96 --> 00:52:15.96
Yeah.

1043
00:52:15.96 --> 00:52:16.96
Did you think you I could tell?

1044
00:52:16.96 --> 00:52:21.000
I thought my arm was a noodle again, but then I still, I would say, you know, I'd see myself

1045
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000
on video and stuff.

1046
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.04
I don't know, I can't even tell.

1047
00:52:24.04 --> 00:52:29.80
And when you can't use the bicep at all for like six months, bro, it does a lot of like

1048
00:52:29.80 --> 00:52:31.64
it shrinks a lot.

1049
00:52:31.64 --> 00:52:36.88
But if you do like everything you can genuinely everything you can, bro, it's like minimal

1050
00:52:36.88 --> 00:52:38.16
minimal, same thing.

1051
00:52:38.16 --> 00:52:42.64
And that's like a good like what do you call it metaphor, whatever for how it can be, you

1052
00:52:42.64 --> 00:52:45.04
know, you just be surprised how much you can still control.

1053
00:52:45.04 --> 00:52:46.04
That's what I'm saying.

1054
00:52:46.04 --> 00:52:51.36
The book super squats, you know, otherwise known as the Bible of lifting.

1055
00:52:51.36 --> 00:52:55.80
But the funny thing is like, oh, how do you get, how do you get big arms?

1056
00:52:55.80 --> 00:52:56.80
Squats.

1057
00:52:56.80 --> 00:52:58.40
How do you get a big neck?

1058
00:52:58.40 --> 00:52:59.40
Squats.

1059
00:52:59.40 --> 00:53:00.40
How do you get big forearms?

1060
00:53:00.40 --> 00:53:01.40
Squats.

1061
00:53:01.40 --> 00:53:03.36
Like that's kind of the response.

1062
00:53:03.36 --> 00:53:04.56
And sure.

1063
00:53:04.56 --> 00:53:05.76
Oh yeah.

1064
00:53:05.76 --> 00:53:10.48
But yes, it is a huge thing to think about how you can respond.

1065
00:53:10.48 --> 00:53:15.000
And also we do have, there are obviously things we can't control, but we can usually control

1066
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.76
a lot more than we than we think.

1067
00:53:16.76 --> 00:53:17.76
Yeah.

1068
00:53:17.76 --> 00:53:20.08
And those might not be a lot more.

1069
00:53:20.08 --> 00:53:21.40
That's going on in your world.

1070
00:53:21.40 --> 00:53:24.76
You control a lot more than you think you can.

1071
00:53:24.76 --> 00:53:31.24
And so keeping that in mind, this is part of the game of mental health.

1072
00:53:31.24 --> 00:53:36.60
And what's scariest about mental health, I think, of all these is that I think it's

1073
00:53:36.60 --> 00:53:39.48
the hardest one to track for yourself.

1074
00:53:39.48 --> 00:53:40.48
Right.

1075
00:53:40.48 --> 00:53:45.48
The hardest one to go, oh, I don't feel good about myself.

1076
00:53:45.48 --> 00:53:47.56
I don't feel like I'm in a good spot.

1077
00:53:47.56 --> 00:53:50.96
I think it's hard for people to track that.

1078
00:53:50.96 --> 00:53:56.76
So it's worth once again, taking a step back and writing down like, okay, I got all these.

1079
00:53:56.76 --> 00:53:57.76
I got my physical health.

1080
00:53:57.76 --> 00:53:58.76
I got my job.

1081
00:53:58.76 --> 00:54:00.20
How satisfying is my job?

1082
00:54:00.20 --> 00:54:03.84
How satisfying are my relationships?

1083
00:54:03.84 --> 00:54:04.84
Where am I at?

1084
00:54:04.84 --> 00:54:08.000
How do I feel at the end of the day?

1085
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000
What's my stress levels?

1086
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.64
So these are things to think about.

1087
00:54:15.64 --> 00:54:19.08
And when you start talking about, when you start taking all these things, when you start

1088
00:54:19.08 --> 00:54:27.16
taking a job and your work and your health and your fitness and your relationships that

1089
00:54:27.16 --> 00:54:37.16
you're in, including friends, including family, then you add mental health and that you take

1090
00:54:37.16 --> 00:54:43.92
all those things together and you get life.

1091
00:54:43.92 --> 00:54:45.40
You get life.

1092
00:54:45.40 --> 00:54:48.96
And that's the supreme game, right?

1093
00:54:48.96 --> 00:54:52.44
That's the big game, the big game that we're playing.

1094
00:54:52.44 --> 00:54:55.52
And obviously there are rules in life.

1095
00:54:55.52 --> 00:55:03.60
And as I started off by saying, we have a lot of say over the rules of the game that we're

1096
00:55:03.60 --> 00:55:09.92
going to play where, where they come from, what set of rules are you going to follow?

1097
00:55:09.92 --> 00:55:13.68
What rules are going to bring you the most gratification?

1098
00:55:13.68 --> 00:55:17.68
How, wait, how do you even pick those rules?

1099
00:55:17.68 --> 00:55:26.40
And then once we figured out game, the game that we are going to play, how do we win?

1100
00:55:26.40 --> 00:55:31.12
And I think we'll talk about that on the next, the next podcast.

1101
00:55:31.12 --> 00:55:36.80
So I realized you kind of were in this mode early on and that's when it hit me, dawned

1102
00:55:36.80 --> 00:55:43.68
upon me how there's this long term and short term game going on.

1103
00:55:43.68 --> 00:55:48.20
And there's also, I don't know, maybe if this is more just a different take on the same

1104
00:55:48.20 --> 00:55:52.24
thing, but there's like a small picture and big picture game going on as well.

1105
00:55:52.24 --> 00:55:53.44
Yeah.

1106
00:55:53.44 --> 00:55:56.48
So it's like short term, long term, big picture, small picture.

1107
00:55:56.48 --> 00:56:02.44
And once you realize that's going on, then you can begin kind of the journey of discovery

1108
00:56:02.44 --> 00:56:06.76
of how many of that, how many elements in life that applies to.

1109
00:56:06.76 --> 00:56:10.44
It applies to everything by the way, but you don't, you don't, it doesn't land on you

1110
00:56:10.44 --> 00:56:12.64
till you really realize, okay, this is going on.

1111
00:56:12.64 --> 00:56:19.36
And then everything you do, everything you're interested in, everything you say in a way

1112
00:56:19.36 --> 00:56:22.24
is like that applies to it.

1113
00:56:22.24 --> 00:56:26.000
Short term, long term game, big picture, small picture game.

1114
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Yeah.

1115
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000
I think it's, I had a similar conversation with Dave Burke.

1116
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Good deal Dave.

1117
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Yeah.

1118
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.68
And it's about oodalooops, right?

1119
00:56:34.68 --> 00:56:35.68
Observe, orient, decide, and act.

1120
00:56:35.68 --> 00:56:39.32
And you got one, you got an oodalooop that you're running like on right now about a business

1121
00:56:39.32 --> 00:56:42.24
decision that you're making with a client that you're going to, you know, talk to later

1122
00:56:42.24 --> 00:56:43.24
today.

1123
00:56:43.24 --> 00:56:44.24
Man.

1124
00:56:44.24 --> 00:56:48.48
You're running, but you're running a oodalooop about that whole division in the company

1125
00:56:48.48 --> 00:56:52.92
and you're running an oodalooop about the whole company and you're running an oodalooop

1126
00:56:52.92 --> 00:56:54.64
about your whole, it's the same thing.

1127
00:56:54.64 --> 00:56:56.28
You're running an oodalooop on your life.

1128
00:56:56.28 --> 00:56:58.36
Like what, observe, where I'm in life right now.

1129
00:56:58.36 --> 00:57:00.36
It's a similar thing.

1130
00:57:00.36 --> 00:57:04.60
Where I might life, observe what's going on, orient yourself where you sit in that big

1131
00:57:04.60 --> 00:57:05.60
picture.

1132
00:57:05.60 --> 00:57:06.60
Yeah.

1133
00:57:06.60 --> 00:57:09.92
But you've got all these different oodalooops and you're running them at the same time.

1134
00:57:09.92 --> 00:57:11.36
So it's the same thing.

1135
00:57:11.36 --> 00:57:19.08
That's why, that's why having this idea, recognizing, I was, I was actually explaining this to my

1136
00:57:19.08 --> 00:57:20.58
daughter.

1137
00:57:20.58 --> 00:57:25.28
And like you could see, as I was explaining it to her, you could see the light bulb.

1138
00:57:25.28 --> 00:57:26.28
Come on.

1139
00:57:26.28 --> 00:57:27.28
Right.

1140
00:57:27.28 --> 00:57:28.28
Like, yes.

1141
00:57:28.28 --> 00:57:29.28
Like, oh, this is a game.

1142
00:57:29.28 --> 00:57:30.28
Oh, that's a game.

1143
00:57:30.28 --> 00:57:31.28
Oh, this other thing's a game.

1144
00:57:31.28 --> 00:57:37.04
And what she said to me is she said, oh, she said, that's why you're detached.

1145
00:57:37.04 --> 00:57:38.04
That's why you're able to detach.

1146
00:57:38.04 --> 00:57:43.28
That's why you don't get mad because this is just a game and you're observing what's

1147
00:57:43.28 --> 00:57:45.04
happening in the game.

1148
00:57:45.04 --> 00:57:50.52
And so you're not going to get emotional because like, well, when you lose a point,

1149
00:57:50.52 --> 00:57:53.44
do you run off the field and break down?

1150
00:57:53.44 --> 00:57:54.44
No.

1151
00:57:54.44 --> 00:57:55.44
You're like, okay, lost a point.

1152
00:57:55.44 --> 00:57:56.44
We'll make some adjustments.

1153
00:57:56.44 --> 00:57:57.76
Like that's the way it is.

1154
00:57:57.76 --> 00:58:03.60
And by the way, there's very, all these little subordinate games that are being played,

1155
00:58:03.60 --> 00:58:07.04
ultimately compared to the Supreme game, they don't really matter that much.

1156
00:58:07.04 --> 00:58:08.88
So you can kind of shrug them off.

1157
00:58:08.88 --> 00:58:13.16
Now listen, we all know that there's people that get wrapped up in a game, right?

1158
00:58:13.16 --> 00:58:14.16
They get wrapped up.

1159
00:58:14.16 --> 00:58:15.16
They're 17 years old.

1160
00:58:15.16 --> 00:58:16.16
They got the girlfriend.

1161
00:58:16.16 --> 00:58:17.68
They get wrapped up in that one relationship game.

1162
00:58:17.68 --> 00:58:20.40
And when she dumps him, that guy's freaking done.

1163
00:58:20.40 --> 00:58:23.76
He wants to kill himself or does kill himself, right?

1164
00:58:23.76 --> 00:58:26.28
Everybody that's watching that goes, Hey man, that was just one little game that you were

1165
00:58:26.28 --> 00:58:27.28
playing.

1166
00:58:27.28 --> 00:58:29.28
What are you doing?

1167
00:58:29.28 --> 00:58:32.04
Don't give it up over one little game.

1168
00:58:32.04 --> 00:58:36.88
That's like you're playing, you know, high pop Warner football.

1169
00:58:36.88 --> 00:58:39.20
You lose a game.

1170
00:58:39.20 --> 00:58:40.20
End of the world.

1171
00:58:40.20 --> 00:58:41.20
No, it's not the end of the world.

1172
00:58:41.20 --> 00:58:42.20
It's one game.

1173
00:58:42.20 --> 00:58:43.20
What has another thing my daughter pointed out.

1174
00:58:43.20 --> 00:58:45.52
It's like, Oh, she goes, Oh, you learn from these games.

1175
00:58:45.52 --> 00:58:46.52
I'm like, yes.

1176
00:58:46.52 --> 00:58:47.52
Yes, you do.

1177
00:58:47.52 --> 00:58:49.72
I do learn from the game.

1178
00:58:49.72 --> 00:58:51.60
Part of the game is, Oh, I made a mistake in the game.

1179
00:58:51.60 --> 00:58:52.60
Cool.

1180
00:58:52.60 --> 00:58:54.68
I just learned and I won't make that mistake again.

1181
00:58:54.68 --> 00:59:02.88
So there's a detachment that comes from this view that's very powerful to utilize just

1182
00:59:02.88 --> 00:59:06.32
to say, Oh, didn't get the job.

1183
00:59:06.32 --> 00:59:08.20
Oh, that's okay.

1184
00:59:08.20 --> 00:59:11.16
That's part of the game that I didn't win in this particular game at that particular

1185
00:59:11.16 --> 00:59:12.16
moment.

1186
00:59:12.16 --> 00:59:13.16
I learned from it.

1187
00:59:13.16 --> 00:59:14.16
Here's what I'm going to do.

1188
00:59:14.16 --> 00:59:15.16
Relationship didn't work out.

1189
00:59:15.16 --> 00:59:16.16
Oh, okay.

1190
00:59:16.16 --> 00:59:17.16
What kind of learn from that?

1191
00:59:17.16 --> 00:59:18.24
Not the end of the world.

1192
00:59:18.24 --> 00:59:19.92
Not the last game I'm ever going to play.

1193
00:59:19.92 --> 00:59:22.96
No one's going to be actually a lot more games.

1194
00:59:22.96 --> 00:59:27.64
So crazy how if you put things into perspective, it's like, Oh man, things become so clear.

1195
00:59:27.64 --> 00:59:28.64
You know what?

1196
00:59:28.64 --> 00:59:29.64
We're tricking distracted.

1197
00:59:29.64 --> 00:59:30.64
That's a thing.

1198
00:59:30.64 --> 00:59:31.64
Cause like, you know, okay.

1199
00:59:31.64 --> 00:59:33.48
You know when you're young, you save money, right?

1200
00:59:33.48 --> 00:59:34.48
Like I don't know.

1201
00:59:34.48 --> 00:59:36.84
You want to buy a slingshot or something like this.

1202
00:59:36.84 --> 00:59:40.48
And you're like, okay, I got to save up $12 to buy that slingshot.

1203
00:59:40.48 --> 00:59:41.48
Boom.

1204
00:59:41.48 --> 00:59:45.20
You're already aware of the game that you're playing short term, long term, you know,

1205
00:59:45.20 --> 00:59:47.52
like, Oh, the Jolly Rancher for sale over there.

1206
00:59:47.52 --> 00:59:50.96
I'm not going to buy that Jolly Rancher cause I'm saving that $1 for this.

1207
00:59:50.96 --> 00:59:54.88
But it is part of it cause that's part of the game too, right?

1208
00:59:54.88 --> 00:59:58.12
Discipline, just understanding the long term is more important than the short term and

1209
00:59:58.12 --> 00:59:59.12
being able to follow through.

1210
00:59:59.12 --> 01:00:01.36
So all it is in a nutshell.

1211
01:00:01.36 --> 01:00:05.56
So you kind of know, that's an example of like knowing the game, but you get distracted.

1212
01:00:05.56 --> 01:00:10.48
Like the Jolly Rancher is like super delicious or someone, you know, something like this.

1213
01:00:10.48 --> 01:00:14.32
That's part of the opponent kind of jamming you up.

1214
01:00:14.32 --> 01:00:21.68
So like, you know, entertainment in general, social media, whatever, TV, Netflix, all this

1215
01:00:21.68 --> 01:00:22.68
stuff.

1216
01:00:22.68 --> 01:00:26.72
These are all like distractions, trying to distract you from your, whatever your goals,

1217
01:00:26.72 --> 01:00:29.64
you're winning your game or whatever and whatever capacity.

1218
01:00:29.64 --> 01:00:32.96
But at the same time, it's part of someone else's game to win their game.

1219
01:00:32.96 --> 01:00:33.96
Yeah.

1220
01:00:33.96 --> 01:00:41.44
And I think the biggest, and this was kind of the opening discussion we had here, the

1221
01:00:41.44 --> 01:00:46.72
worst thing to have happen is you're in the water and you don't know that you're in the

1222
01:00:46.72 --> 01:00:47.72
water.

1223
01:00:47.72 --> 01:00:48.72
You're in the game.

1224
01:00:48.72 --> 01:00:49.72
You don't know that you're in the game.

1225
01:00:49.72 --> 01:00:53.60
So this should be, for some people, this will be hearing what we're talking about.

1226
01:00:53.60 --> 01:00:58.80
It should be a perspective shift for their life, realizing that they're in a game, that

1227
01:00:58.80 --> 01:01:02.80
there's rules, that there's objectives, that you're going to have opponents, you're going

1228
01:01:02.80 --> 01:01:04.12
to have allies.

1229
01:01:04.12 --> 01:01:05.76
All these things are going on.

1230
01:01:05.76 --> 01:01:07.80
They're all going on.

1231
01:01:07.80 --> 01:01:10.08
And if you don't recognize it, you're going to come up short.

1232
01:01:10.08 --> 01:01:11.64
This is what entertainment is.

1233
01:01:11.64 --> 01:01:12.64
Okay.

1234
01:01:12.64 --> 01:01:16.52
In football, there's a lot of, in boxing, there's faints and all this stuff.

1235
01:01:16.52 --> 01:01:19.96
So in football, there's like, there's a bunch of different ways, obviously, but there's

1236
01:01:19.96 --> 01:01:25.80
a play where the quarterback will fake to the full back and then he'll kind of roll

1237
01:01:25.80 --> 01:01:27.04
out and do some stuff.

1238
01:01:27.04 --> 01:01:30.80
So social media and Netflix, all that stuff, what that is, is the fake.

1239
01:01:30.80 --> 01:01:34.16
They make you like pay attention to that thing while they, and they use you.

1240
01:01:34.16 --> 01:01:37.16
They totally use you to pay attention to this one thing.

1241
01:01:37.16 --> 01:01:39.68
Maybe your people on your team are going to pay attention to you a little bit.

1242
01:01:39.68 --> 01:01:40.68
Tell us that fake.

1243
01:01:40.68 --> 01:01:44.12
So they're going to all do what I want them to do while we go do this other thing.

1244
01:01:44.12 --> 01:01:45.80
Meanwhile, you're losing your game.

1245
01:01:45.80 --> 01:01:48.12
We're winning our game, using it as a pawn.

1246
01:01:48.12 --> 01:01:49.36
That's what social media is.

1247
01:01:49.36 --> 01:01:50.36
Oh yeah.

1248
01:01:50.36 --> 01:01:51.64
You're definitely getting played.

1249
01:01:51.64 --> 01:01:53.44
You're definitely getting, they're playing a game.

1250
01:01:53.44 --> 01:01:57.40
And if you're sitting there and it's eating up your brain, they're winning the game.

1251
01:01:57.40 --> 01:01:59.88
You probably don't even know you're in the game.

1252
01:01:59.88 --> 01:02:03.48
You don't realize that they're taking your information and selling it and all that stuff.

1253
01:02:03.48 --> 01:02:04.48
That's what's going on.

1254
01:02:04.48 --> 01:02:05.48
Oh yeah.

1255
01:02:05.48 --> 01:02:06.48
The whole game.

1256
01:02:06.48 --> 01:02:08.28
Like yeah, all around, all around.

1257
01:02:08.28 --> 01:02:09.72
Don't pay attention to it.

1258
01:02:09.72 --> 01:02:14.80
We will continue this on the next podcast.

1259
01:02:14.80 --> 01:02:18.44
In the meantime, you know what you're going to need on the health side.

1260
01:02:18.44 --> 01:02:19.44
Yep.

1261
01:02:19.44 --> 01:02:20.44
Going to need to be healthy.

1262
01:02:20.44 --> 01:02:21.44
You need some healthy fuel.

1263
01:02:21.44 --> 01:02:22.44
Get yourself some jocofuel.

1264
01:02:22.44 --> 01:02:23.44
Jocofuel.com.

1265
01:02:23.44 --> 01:02:26.80
Drinking some energy drinks right now.

1266
01:02:26.80 --> 01:02:27.80
Yep.

1267
01:02:27.80 --> 01:02:28.80
I'm on the MOLK train right here.

1268
01:02:28.80 --> 01:02:29.80
Oh yeah.

1269
01:02:29.80 --> 01:02:30.80
How's that banana?

1270
01:02:30.80 --> 01:02:31.80
Banana all day.

1271
01:02:31.80 --> 01:02:32.80
Banana cream.

1272
01:02:32.80 --> 01:02:33.80
There's a difference.

1273
01:02:33.80 --> 01:02:34.80
Yeah, it's true.

1274
01:02:34.80 --> 01:02:35.80
There's a difference.

1275
01:02:35.80 --> 01:02:36.80
Yeah.

1276
01:02:36.80 --> 01:02:37.80
Banana cream is always good in my opinion.

1277
01:02:37.80 --> 01:02:39.88
I've never tasted a banana cream.

1278
01:02:39.88 --> 01:02:42.48
Anything that wasn't good, this is no exception.

1279
01:02:42.48 --> 01:02:43.48
So tasty.

1280
01:02:43.48 --> 01:02:44.48
Tasty.

1281
01:02:44.48 --> 01:02:45.76
It's, you know what's nice about the MOLK?

1282
01:02:45.76 --> 01:02:49.96
Like I got done training yesterday and I got done training the day before and I got done

1283
01:02:49.96 --> 01:02:51.80
training the day before.

1284
01:02:51.80 --> 01:02:57.36
And every day when I got done training on the way out, I just went ahead and just grabbed

1285
01:02:57.36 --> 01:02:58.36
the MOLK.

1286
01:02:58.36 --> 01:02:59.36
You're good.

1287
01:02:59.36 --> 01:03:01.52
Just on the road, on the drive home.

1288
01:03:01.52 --> 01:03:02.52
Seven minute drive home.

1289
01:03:02.52 --> 01:03:04.04
Here's 30 grams of protein.

1290
01:03:04.04 --> 01:03:05.04
Yeah.

1291
01:03:05.04 --> 01:03:06.04
Right?

1292
01:03:06.04 --> 01:03:07.04
How good is that?

1293
01:03:07.04 --> 01:03:09.04
What did you know on the weekends?

1294
01:03:09.04 --> 01:03:12.52
So Friday, Saturday, well I guess Friday I happen to get some training in this Friday,

1295
01:03:12.52 --> 01:03:21.64
but Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I'm waking up, lifting, running, coming to Jiu Jitsu, no

1296
01:03:21.64 --> 01:03:22.64
food.

1297
01:03:22.64 --> 01:03:23.64
Yeah.

1298
01:03:23.64 --> 01:03:24.64
Oh damn, no food after that?

1299
01:03:24.64 --> 01:03:25.64
Okay.

1300
01:03:25.64 --> 01:03:28.52
No, I might have some, I might have like a handful of nuts or whatever.

1301
01:03:28.52 --> 01:03:29.52
Yeah.

1302
01:03:29.52 --> 01:03:30.52
Like a handful.

1303
01:03:30.52 --> 01:03:33.32
But I want to go, I don't want to go training with the big like gut full of food.

1304
01:03:33.32 --> 01:03:39.44
How long between end of the running, lifting scenario and the Jiu Jitsu, how long in between?

1305
01:03:39.44 --> 01:03:41.84
An hour and a half, two hours or something like this.

1306
01:03:41.84 --> 01:03:42.84
Yeah.

1307
01:03:42.84 --> 01:03:43.84
Okay.

1308
01:03:43.84 --> 01:03:45.24
That's why I have like a little, maybe a handful of nuts.

1309
01:03:45.24 --> 01:03:49.52
Maybe I'll have, you know, I've been having a lot lately is just mozzarella cheese with

1310
01:03:49.52 --> 01:03:51.84
some olive oil and balsamic vinegar on it.

1311
01:03:51.84 --> 01:03:52.84
Oh yeah, bro.

1312
01:03:52.84 --> 01:03:53.84
I love those.

1313
01:03:53.84 --> 01:03:54.84
That's one of my things now.

1314
01:03:54.84 --> 01:03:55.84
Yeah.

1315
01:03:55.84 --> 01:03:56.84
Right.

1316
01:03:56.84 --> 01:03:57.84
Yeah.

1317
01:03:57.84 --> 01:03:58.84
Sarah made these yesterday and the day before.

1318
01:03:58.84 --> 01:03:59.84
And she doesn't always make that.

1319
01:03:59.84 --> 01:04:00.84
Did she put the basil on there?

1320
01:04:00.84 --> 01:04:01.84
Yes.

1321
01:04:01.84 --> 01:04:02.84
And a tomato.

1322
01:04:02.84 --> 01:04:07.24
I don't like the tomatoes, but the, but even that, I don't really want to have that.

1323
01:04:07.24 --> 01:04:11.40
I want to come to Jiu Jitsu and I want to have like a pretty empty stomach.

1324
01:04:11.40 --> 01:04:16.56
So you know what I will, on the way I'll have a go and you know, Wes, but first of all,

1325
01:04:16.56 --> 01:04:20.80
Wes is just like already too strong and too flexible and too good at Jiu Jitsu and he

1326
01:04:20.80 --> 01:04:22.64
rolls in and he's pounding a go.

1327
01:04:22.64 --> 01:04:26.64
Like he, he's doing it in my face or like trying to get it, trying to get in my head.

1328
01:04:26.64 --> 01:04:27.64
Right.

1329
01:04:27.64 --> 01:04:28.64
He's like, oh, he's pounding that thing.

1330
01:04:28.64 --> 01:04:29.64
I'm like, dude.

1331
01:04:29.64 --> 01:04:31.44
So then I started getting after it.

1332
01:04:31.44 --> 01:04:35.32
You know, so now I have a go on the drive here and I have a, I have a go on the drive

1333
01:04:35.32 --> 01:04:36.32
here.

1334
01:04:36.32 --> 01:04:37.84
I have a mok on the way home.

1335
01:04:37.84 --> 01:04:39.52
This is a great combo.

1336
01:04:39.52 --> 01:04:41.40
This is a great combo.

1337
01:04:41.40 --> 01:04:48.60
So jockelfield.com, go to vitamin shop, go to Wawa, go to the military commissaries,

1338
01:04:48.60 --> 01:04:53.16
go to Hannaford, go to H-E-B.

1339
01:04:53.16 --> 01:04:56.44
By the way, everyone in Texas that's been going to H-E-B just getting it on.

1340
01:04:56.44 --> 01:04:57.44
We appreciate it.

1341
01:04:57.44 --> 01:04:59.40
We're dominating in H-E-B.

1342
01:04:59.40 --> 01:05:01.16
So rolling in there.

1343
01:05:01.16 --> 01:05:03.64
Murphy's, Meyer up in the Midwest.

1344
01:05:03.64 --> 01:05:08.52
Hey, and by the way, a lot of people hit me up like, hey, they don't have this in there.

1345
01:05:08.52 --> 01:05:09.52
Tell the store.

1346
01:05:09.52 --> 01:05:12.80
So say, hey, look, there's no go.

1347
01:05:12.80 --> 01:05:14.68
There's no whatever, whatever it is that they're missing.

1348
01:05:14.68 --> 01:05:16.76
Just let them know you want it.

1349
01:05:16.76 --> 01:05:18.56
And they'll hook it up.

1350
01:05:18.56 --> 01:05:22.80
So we're making the best possible stuff you can make.

1351
01:05:22.80 --> 01:05:23.80
So get it.

1352
01:05:23.80 --> 01:05:25.48
It'll help you in all aspects of your life.

1353
01:05:25.48 --> 01:05:26.48
Yeah.

1354
01:05:26.48 --> 01:05:29.04
Talk about that, that health and capability game.

1355
01:05:29.04 --> 01:05:35.72
Yeah, it was Peter Tia where he was making a broader point, but he was like, hey, if

1356
01:05:35.72 --> 01:05:43.20
you want to kick ass at 80, you can't be slacking at 70 or whatever the numbers were.

1357
01:05:43.20 --> 01:05:44.20
They might have been different.

1358
01:05:44.20 --> 01:05:46.32
But it's basically like, hey, this is a long-term play.

1359
01:05:46.32 --> 01:05:48.76
You can't just jam yourself up and ignore it and whatever.

1360
01:05:48.76 --> 01:05:51.88
And then once you start getting older, then try to jump on the trail.

1361
01:05:51.88 --> 01:05:55.20
It's like, Brad, you can still be jammed up.

1362
01:05:55.20 --> 01:05:56.20
You know what I'm saying?

1363
01:05:56.20 --> 01:05:57.20
Yeah.

1364
01:05:57.20 --> 01:05:58.20
You know what?

1365
01:05:58.20 --> 01:05:59.56
You lose a little bit at a time.

1366
01:05:59.56 --> 01:06:01.20
You know, I was talking to Bert Soren.

1367
01:06:01.20 --> 01:06:02.20
Sure.

1368
01:06:02.20 --> 01:06:05.28
And we were just talking about lifting.

1369
01:06:05.28 --> 01:06:08.08
And he's just about beast.

1370
01:06:08.08 --> 01:06:13.08
But basically, I was saying, hey, if there's like an exercise, you know, when you get injured

1371
01:06:13.08 --> 01:06:17.20
and you can't do a particular exercise, like for instance, when my arm was hurt, I couldn't

1372
01:06:17.20 --> 01:06:20.20
do overhead squats for a long period of time.

1373
01:06:20.20 --> 01:06:27.76
After Dean Lister freaking crashed my arm, showing a move, by the way, Dean Lister.

1374
01:06:27.76 --> 01:06:32.68
Anyways, I couldn't like lock my arms out for an overhead squat.

1375
01:06:32.68 --> 01:06:35.72
And for months, I couldn't do an overhead squat.

1376
01:06:35.72 --> 01:06:38.24
And so then when I eventually could do it again, it was really humbling.

1377
01:06:38.24 --> 01:06:40.24
It was like PVC pipe.

1378
01:06:40.24 --> 01:06:46.96
You know, you're like thinking, God, but when we're talking to Bert, like, hey, don't submit.

1379
01:06:46.96 --> 01:06:48.64
Don't surrender that movement.

1380
01:06:48.64 --> 01:06:52.44
Because it's real easy to just say, that's something I can no longer do.

1381
01:06:52.44 --> 01:06:54.88
And it happens a little bit at a time.

1382
01:06:54.88 --> 01:06:55.88
Right?

1383
01:06:55.88 --> 01:06:56.88
It's like one day.

1384
01:06:56.88 --> 01:07:00.16
I don't know if I can really do them today.

1385
01:07:00.16 --> 01:07:03.28
And then the next time, maybe you can't really do them.

1386
01:07:03.28 --> 01:07:05.88
So just pay attention to that, man.

1387
01:07:05.88 --> 01:07:12.36
You got to that physical part that we're talking, this physical game that we're talking about.

1388
01:07:12.36 --> 01:07:18.04
It's a long term strategic game that's that's the death of a thousand cuts.

1389
01:07:18.04 --> 01:07:20.96
And look, you know what, you're eventually going to lose.

1390
01:07:20.96 --> 01:07:22.60
Like 100% you're going to lose.

1391
01:07:22.60 --> 01:07:23.60
Right?

1392
01:07:23.60 --> 01:07:24.60
Like I'm going to.

1393
01:07:24.60 --> 01:07:27.64
At this point, it actually looks like I might get old and die.

1394
01:07:27.64 --> 01:07:30.76
You should think I wouldn't get old and die, but this one kind of looks like I might get

1395
01:07:30.76 --> 01:07:31.76
old and die.

1396
01:07:31.76 --> 01:07:37.08
So you know, you're going to go with death of a thousand cuts, but you can postpone

1397
01:07:37.08 --> 01:07:38.84
one cut today.

1398
01:07:38.84 --> 01:07:40.44
Push one cut off today.

1399
01:07:40.44 --> 01:07:41.44
That's another day you went.

1400
01:07:41.44 --> 01:07:46.20
You know, it's another day without that little, that little razor cutting your tendons and

1401
01:07:46.20 --> 01:07:47.20
whatnot.

1402
01:07:47.20 --> 01:07:48.36
So that's what we're doing.

1403
01:07:48.36 --> 01:07:49.36
Jockofuel.com.

1404
01:07:49.36 --> 01:07:50.36
Check it out.

1405
01:07:50.36 --> 01:07:51.36
Yep.

1406
01:07:51.36 --> 01:07:52.36
That supplements in the world.

1407
01:07:52.36 --> 01:07:53.36
Factually.

1408
01:07:53.36 --> 01:07:55.16
Everyone knows it.

1409
01:07:55.16 --> 01:07:56.96
Also origin USA.

1410
01:07:56.96 --> 01:08:02.40
Yeez for Jiu Jitsu, Rash guards, American, all American made stuff to big deal.

1411
01:08:02.40 --> 01:08:07.76
Jeans, boots, T shirts, just everything that you need.

1412
01:08:07.76 --> 01:08:11.64
You can get origin USA.com and we're building all in America.

1413
01:08:11.64 --> 01:08:13.14
We got factories here.

1414
01:08:13.14 --> 01:08:15.78
We got an awesome workforce.

1415
01:08:15.78 --> 01:08:16.78
So that's what we're doing.

1416
01:08:16.78 --> 01:08:22.84
We're not enslaving people like they are doing overseas, working a 13 year old girl

1417
01:08:22.84 --> 01:08:25.48
in a sweatshop for a dollar a month.

1418
01:08:25.48 --> 01:08:26.48
That's what's going on.

1419
01:08:26.48 --> 01:08:30.32
If you buy those other brands, I'm going to go and say, don't do that.

1420
01:08:30.32 --> 01:08:33.84
I'm going to say support America, support freedom.

1421
01:08:33.84 --> 01:08:34.84
So there you go.

1422
01:08:34.84 --> 01:08:36.84
Origin USA.com gets on.

1423
01:08:36.84 --> 01:08:40.52
Also, uh, jocles stores called jocles stores where you can represent while we're on this

1424
01:08:40.52 --> 01:08:41.52
path.

1425
01:08:41.52 --> 01:08:42.52
That's a thing too.

1426
01:08:42.52 --> 01:08:44.68
Oh yeah.

1427
01:08:44.68 --> 01:08:45.92
Discipline equals freedom.

1428
01:08:45.92 --> 01:08:46.92
Good.

1429
01:08:46.92 --> 01:08:51.92
This attitude of moving on, you know, in the face of adversity, knowing what you can control

1430
01:08:51.92 --> 01:08:56.64
and what you can't guess what the good mantra kind of stands for.

1431
01:08:56.64 --> 01:08:57.76
Nonetheless, you want to represent.

1432
01:08:57.76 --> 01:08:58.76
That's where you do it.

1433
01:08:58.76 --> 01:09:01.92
Also, we have a short locker, which is a subscription scenario.

1434
01:09:01.92 --> 01:09:04.52
You want a new shirt every month.

1435
01:09:04.52 --> 01:09:05.52
Different designs.

1436
01:09:05.52 --> 01:09:06.52
Good though.

1437
01:09:06.52 --> 01:09:08.80
Kind of like nice when you know other people are out there.

1438
01:09:08.80 --> 01:09:10.48
We're all kind of wearing the same.

1439
01:09:10.48 --> 01:09:11.48
Yes.

1440
01:09:11.48 --> 01:09:13.56
Unique shirt on the same team.

1441
01:09:13.56 --> 01:09:14.56
So there you go.

1442
01:09:14.56 --> 01:09:15.56
It's true.

1443
01:09:15.56 --> 01:09:16.56
Uh, subscribe to the podcast.

1444
01:09:16.56 --> 01:09:19.92
Don't forget about jockel underground, $8 and 18 cents a month.

1445
01:09:19.92 --> 01:09:22.24
It's our, our, our own platform.

1446
01:09:22.24 --> 01:09:24.20
You might be listening to it on it right now.

1447
01:09:24.20 --> 01:09:25.48
We appreciate it.

1448
01:09:25.48 --> 01:09:29.56
That's how we're going to stay alive if we ever get banned.

1449
01:09:29.56 --> 01:09:32.96
Who knows some wild shit going on right now.

1450
01:09:32.96 --> 01:09:33.96
So be careful.

1451
01:09:33.96 --> 01:09:34.96
We got a YouTube channel.

1452
01:09:34.96 --> 01:09:35.96
Origin USA has a YouTube channel.

1453
01:09:35.96 --> 01:09:36.96
We got psychological warfare.

1454
01:09:36.96 --> 01:09:38.40
We got flipside canvas.

1455
01:09:38.40 --> 01:09:41.000
Got a bunch of books that I've written.

1456
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.40
So if you want to check those out, also we have jockel publishing.

1457
01:09:43.40 --> 01:09:45.92
We got Holly, Holly McKay's book.

1458
01:09:45.92 --> 01:09:49.40
Um, Esson Front Leadership Consultancy.

1459
01:09:49.40 --> 01:09:51.12
We sell problems through leadership.

1460
01:09:51.12 --> 01:09:52.12
Go to essonfront.com.

1461
01:09:52.12 --> 01:09:55.84
If you need help in any organization, if you want to come to our live events, check

1462
01:09:55.84 --> 01:09:57.000
those out.

1463
01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.72
We also have extreme ownership academy.

1464
01:09:59.72 --> 01:10:05.36
So you can take the lessons that we learned and you can apply them to your life.

1465
01:10:05.36 --> 01:10:06.36
That's what that's about.

1466
01:10:06.36 --> 01:10:09.96
You're not going to get good at leadership.

1467
01:10:09.96 --> 01:10:12.12
You're not going to understand decision making.

1468
01:10:12.12 --> 01:10:19.24
You're not going to understand how to overcome adversity by going to the gym one time.

1469
01:10:19.24 --> 01:10:21.92
You need that, that rep, those reps.

1470
01:10:21.92 --> 01:10:23.20
So go to extremeownership.com.

1471
01:10:23.20 --> 01:10:27.64
I'm on there answering questions live.

1472
01:10:27.64 --> 01:10:28.64
Extreme ownership.com.

1473
01:10:28.64 --> 01:10:31.64
Also, if you want to help service members, you want to help active and retire.

1474
01:10:31.64 --> 01:10:38.000
We just had mama Leon, you know, her great organization, America's mighty warriors.org.

1475
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.80
She's continuing Mark Lee's legacy.

1476
01:10:40.80 --> 01:10:43.24
Mark is still helping his teammates through that organization.

1477
01:10:43.24 --> 01:10:45.68
And also don't forget about heroes and horses.

1478
01:10:45.68 --> 01:10:48.48
Micah Fink up there in the wilderness.

1479
01:10:48.48 --> 01:10:49.60
Right now who knows what he's doing.

1480
01:10:49.60 --> 01:10:55.84
He's probably on a freaking horse somewhere chasing a grizzly down with a stick getting

1481
01:10:55.84 --> 01:10:57.32
ready to get some.

1482
01:10:57.32 --> 01:11:01.44
So if you want to find yourself, he can help you out heroesandhorses.org.

1483
01:11:01.44 --> 01:11:02.76
He's helping a lot of veterans up there.

1484
01:11:02.76 --> 01:11:04.72
You can connect with us on the interwebs.

1485
01:11:04.72 --> 01:11:06.12
Echoes at Echo Charles.

1486
01:11:06.12 --> 01:11:09.44
He's back on Twitter, by the way, after you got.

1487
01:11:09.44 --> 01:11:10.44
It's a long time.

1488
01:11:10.44 --> 01:11:16.16
He made mistakes, you know, made mistakes, dumb mistakes, honestly.

1489
01:11:16.16 --> 01:11:17.16
I'm normally not critical.

1490
01:11:17.16 --> 01:11:18.72
Maybe I'm a little bit.

1491
01:11:18.72 --> 01:11:19.72
Oh yeah.

1492
01:11:19.72 --> 01:11:20.72
You're critical from time to time.

1493
01:11:20.72 --> 01:11:22.24
So some dumb mistakes got made.

1494
01:11:22.24 --> 01:11:23.56
Price was paid.

1495
01:11:23.56 --> 01:11:25.88
Paid and we're moving forward.

1496
01:11:25.88 --> 01:11:29.24
You and your 13 Twitter followers now.

1497
01:11:29.24 --> 01:11:30.68
All right, there you go.

1498
01:11:30.68 --> 01:11:31.68
And I'm at Jocko Willink.

1499
01:11:31.68 --> 01:11:32.84
Watch out for the algorithm, right?

1500
01:11:32.84 --> 01:11:33.84
Yes.

1501
01:11:33.84 --> 01:11:34.84
They're playing a game on you.

1502
01:11:34.84 --> 01:11:37.16
Don't be part of that game.

1503
01:11:37.16 --> 01:11:42.64
Thanks to all the folks out there in uniform around the world fighting to protect freedom.

1504
01:11:42.64 --> 01:11:44.76
You allow us to be doing what we're doing right now.

1505
01:11:44.76 --> 01:11:46.92
We humbly thank you for your service.

1506
01:11:46.92 --> 01:11:50.68
Also thanks to our police law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

1507
01:11:50.68 --> 01:11:54.72
correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all the first responders out there.

1508
01:11:54.72 --> 01:11:56.76
You keep us safe here at home.

1509
01:11:56.76 --> 01:11:59.72
We thank you for your service as well.

1510
01:11:59.72 --> 01:12:07.60
And everyone else out there, pay attention to the water that you're in.

1511
01:12:07.60 --> 01:12:09.000
There's games going on.

1512
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
You're in them.

1513
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.60
Some of them are important.

1514
01:12:13.60 --> 01:12:15.84
Some of them are just for fun.

1515
01:12:15.84 --> 01:12:25.84
And the big one, life, this is not a frolicking game of amusement, but it's a game with rules

1516
01:12:25.84 --> 01:12:30.20
and goals and winners and losers.

1517
01:12:30.20 --> 01:12:35.68
So make sure you know what games you are playing so you can win.

1518
01:12:35.68 --> 01:12:38.64
And we will continue that conversation next time.

1519
01:12:38.64 --> 01:12:42.32
And until then, this is Echo and Jocko.

1520
01:12:42.32 --> 01:12:49.32
Thank you for watching.
