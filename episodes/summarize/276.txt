The funny things are finally I made it for this platinum, so I was not in the more fucking new guy, I was not in the more this meat, and we, I don't remember, so when you come back from the first platinum, or you come back from the platinum, from the deployment, you're like, hey, I got this school, I'm going to sniper school, I'm going to this school, I'm going to this school, so I said hey, Rago, so what's called the jiu-jia, do you know, just what what are you going, it's like, I do them going to English 101, I think the next door, I'm there, it's fucking the regular navy thing, and so I spend the next three months doing the actually English classes, there was not bad because actually it helped me in my career in the future, so basically, so they legit sent you to English school, yes, and I did save my career, you know, these guys were apparently they seen something in me, they say well, you know, he bought your English language, but it is, were you having a hard time like communicate like in that going through the house and stuff like that, because they are trying to communicate you know, especially the communication, going through the house and trying to communicate, so at that time I was still had to, I still had to try and, I didn't tell them that, but I had to translate from what I hear to my Polish thing, then I had to think of the solution, translate back to English and sight, so I managed that, but it is so much easier later on when actually I got my English goods, so that is just flow, you know, but there is still I have to be very fast, because I do that fast. No, I couldn't breathe to my nose, and I couldn't breathe now, I had to breathe through my every time I had to get bread, I was like the water with it, so I think I was breathing water in a year at the time, and I was coughing, I was suffocating, I was I was basically drowning, I felt like I'm drowning, and it's just as I'm going to quit, but I'll just pass out, and see what will happen if I have to, but I didn't pass out, I got better, actually, by the time there was a fourth phase, I was at pre phase one, before you class up for the, for the seal training, so by the time we graduate from the fourth phase, moving to our real seal class, they instructed us asking me to demonstrate the new guys have to swim the side strokes, so I became really good, I was never fast swim about that was strong, so we might have to be swimming forever, and you didn't come up with any injuries or anything, being a 33 year old guy going through Buds, not at the time, the worst guys were always tired, I was looking at these young guys, like, hey, let's go to the bar, I was like, dude, I can hardly move, I can't go to the bar, I was still making out to the bar here and there, but there was just like really painful for me, because again, I was not the intensity of it, it's not just the one time, because like one time, like seal training, I think most of the people that one day can, like, he might survive, but it over and over and over, it just wears your body, wears you down, and eventually you have some people quit, so that was the most difficult for me, because I did not recover as fast-being 32 years old, as other guys, so what was your first, where your first orders were team did you get? So we had agreement, we had always partnered with one of the guys, and we had agreement, you know, if I ask you had a question, you answered it correctly, so I don't have to, because if you answered correctly, I have to retitch you because these people are watching, if I don't catch your error or your wrong answer, then they will go into it to me in the air, so we are okay, so we are with the document, and you know, there is a point in the skydiving too, when we teach people eventually, saying like, so there is an altitude that you have to make your decision, either cada way, the malfunction, the parachute, if you have malfunction, and open the reserve, or you ride it the ground, so I think it was at times 2000 feet, you saw it by 2000 feet, you never have a good parachute, and you need to make the decision to cada way as a new jumper, and and and and open your reserve, if you didn't do it by the time, it was like you just should be riding it to the ground, so we got to it and say, look at this guy in this commission is listening there, and so okay, now tell me what is your hard day, this guy looks at me, so like what, I was like, you know, tell me what is your hard day, I say, I can't tell that, so now I'm getting a man that's like mother fucker, don't fuck with me, what is your hard day, and he says, what do you mean, what do you mean, I said, you know, the 2000 foot hard day, I don't have 2000 foot hard day, I was like, man, I have to punch this guy, look up there, and this how this, they're laying under a table in the parking so hard, I was so focused that, you know, it's a 2000 foot hard day, yeah, yeah, he's working right here, I'm just copying him, I'll write that in the other, and then, and that's, man, so he's like, okay, if somebody comes in, just kick me, I'm going to sleep, I say, okay, he's sleeping, great guy, actually this is the first time that I was exposed to America, I'm American way of eating too, because, so I remember saying, you know, you need to come over here, we'll have a stakes, and I'll just, we'll just have a stakes and say, okay, so I show up, and there's a big, I think, two stakes, no, three stakes, where she's girlfriend there, so there's big, as three stakes are like, I'm going to be eating it for a month, I mean, so like, so who, who else is coming here, he said, now I just three of us, I say, I'm going to write the stakes, yeah, you can have one, I mean, the one is for you here, you can't pick whatever you want, I was like, I mean, they didn't tie a stake, he's like, yeah, who was wrong with that, I say, dude, how'd be slicing it and slicing it just to let you think would last me for a month, and Paul and, and I, I just didn't know that you can just take like that just by the slub of meat, you've cooking in the U.S., that's like, what the fuck, and I love stakes, I'm addicted to stakes now, so, so that was how it's exposed first time, and you get it done in four days, and then I'm going to become a jump master and you're working as hard as you can, it's like you have this open free way in front of you for America, you can be whatever you are able to be, you know, I can say whatever you want to be, because I want to be as an Arab, I'm 60 years old, I ain't going to be as an Arab, I'm not a Arab, but but you can be whatever you are able to be, there is nothing to stop you like different countries, what's your background, who is your mom, are you coming, so are you belong to Socialist Party, so we can help you, but if you know, you cannot be in this position, you cannot go to college even, if you don't have, you are not part of the Socialist Youth Organization, so for me, yeah, there was like the entire world open, I could be whatever I was able to be and there was nothing stopping me, so even more, even more makes me that stick to my word, I want to be the best citizens, I want to make this country, the best can be and contribute to it, so that's where the first person who came out and I just became US citizen at the time, so as like, okay, I can't build the jobs for these people, I'm not reaching the half, I don't have resources, but I can fight for them, so this is my country, I'm going to go and sign up, I had no idea how to do it, I remember in post office, I seen those draft cards sometimes that you, you feel like that, so I say, I went up there, I feel like that, I sent it out, I packed my shit, I was leaving with others, skydive hours at the time, so to see what's going on drag, what are you going, I'm going to war, I'm just sending out my papers, and this is the first goal for first goal, so it's 1991, yes, the first goal for kicks off, yes, you want to go fight, I don't think go down to the post office, and fill that, grab the what's that thing called, the selective service should be, yeah, I'm waiting on the van de Simulette, sorry, but this selective service doesn't apply to you, you are to all, so I was already 31 at the time, going 32, and so I say, fuck, I find my, I will find my way into the war, so somebody said, hey, once you go to recruiting golf, recruiting golfies, I say, sure, I went to the army, in Poland, army is everything, you know, it's like army, you're talking about army here for me, that time was, everything was army, so good to army, so, okay, this is me, I would like to join military, I would like to go to war, it's like, okay, what do you want to do, I say, by fight, it's like, no, no, we're like a jobs or something, you have in the skills, I say, no, not really, but I will doubt do whatever you tell me to do, and I just want to go to war, when the war is over, I'll go back to Marlomar life, but I think just for the duration of the war, I would like to join the military, they say, okay, well, let me see, look at my documents, they tell me what to bring, so I bring all the stuff, they did all the war, I say, okay, so we put you as the infantry, I think it was infantrymen and stuff, and I say, absolutely, thank you so much, I'm ready to go any time, and then I see us show up in our jobs, and they were doing demonstration jump, leapfrocks in my face, so we start talking about it a few times together, I say, I think I have such a cool guy, you know, and so they are, so the kidnaps stone and there, and I remember that they were so freaking painful, I mean, I never had a lesson, but I was never beat up, so I had, they were so painful, like this, but that was so painful that I remember they gave me that medicine, I think it was demoral, it's like, didn't work, they don't say that, I need something stronger because I just, I'm about to go crazy, I can, that pain is so, so hard, so they give me a more fun, just like one away, but I remember it was funny thing, because the first time with this job, I had no idea what it was, I was laying in the bunk in the boot camp, and that's just, the Spain came in, I just fell off the bat, and so the tender lights on, and within like three minutes, I had this pool of sweat under my nose, all dripping, and on my force, this medic comes in, hey, are you okay, it's like, fuck do I look okay, to you, I'm never came move, I say what's so, they got me to post me that I passed it, but that was not the worst thing, that was thing, it's like, you know, you're going to this medic, we are about to give you the medic examination for seals, but you had just had a kid and they still don't have to weigh the year, I was like fuck, but in my mind said it was, I want to fight the war in any capacity, you know, I'm, I'm all know that I have that privilege to go and fight for America, so I promise you this is really mad, so I said, So I don't know if I found out that if you like tip one of them from one end, just like a domino thing, it's army guy, they would just totally fall down, they would say they would definitely fall down, and it was actually I thought there was a, there was some music, I think that's pretty cool, you tip one a little bit at the last gauge, gloves now, but my issue was that I don't like PLFs, so I made it, so just so everyone knows, a PLF is a parachute landing fall, and it's a technique that you get taught for static line jumping, where it's supposed to minimize your injuries, because you keep your feet and knees together, and you hit like you kind of like roll, you sort of roll when you hit, and you keep your arms kind of tucked in and it's supposed to prevent you from getting injured, because when you're on one of those parachutes, you're still coming down really fast, it's not like what you see in the movies when guys can kind of come down on a free fall parachute, and they flare, and they just kind of tip toe away from it, you hit pretty hard, especially if you're a heavier guy, the heavier you are, the harder you're going to hit, so they try and teach, and plus the army's working with hundreds and hundreds of people getting thrown out of that thing, getting thrown out of an aircraft every day, so they try and teach the most simple way that they can teach hundreds and hundreds of people how to fall without getting hurt. Yes, we went, those were some of the other problems we went to, Bosnia, to Yugoslavia, we spent time, I was pretty good time, she was like, it was just good, there was something that much to do at the time, but just work out and get big, so that was a good pattern, actually, there was, this is what I made the strongest guy in the team, so I think I can think of Chris S, I don't know if I can bring his name, I don't have the permission I didn't ask him, so just to be on the safe side, but he knows who he is, where he went to France, France, I mean this guy was lifting like about five plates, the bench, bench press, so when we went to France, we just got the French equipment, he just bent that shit out of the, they're bar, bar, bar, when he picked it up, this bribar, I mean the bar bent and those weights are falling off, so all these French guys, they stop working with us, they just like, whenever we rolled into their gym, they just sit down like a bunch of the weird dudes, so that was actually funny, but yeah there was big pattern, I remember, so those entire platoon, I think over 220 pounds, I think those one guy maybe was not, but all of us over 220 pounds, of course Chris was way much more, and Yeah, that was, we had a bunch of, we had a tight group, a lot of good people too, yes, and also you were talking about being big, we were also, we tried to get a platoon average of 200 pounds, and we had to make up for some slack, because we had some bad amount of one thing, and we, I remember we got to, the first place we went was Spain, and I was trying to get to 250, and I'm the same thing, I was like trying, I'm eating, I'm lifting, I'm squatting, I'm eating, and I couldn't get above like two, I don't know, 240, 5 or something like that, and then where we stayed in Spain, they had an all-you-can-eat buffet for all three meals of the day, and I was like, oh, I got this, three days later, I was 250, I weighed in, and I was like, yeah, 250, and then I went on a four mile run, and I was like, okay, I need to lose weight, sucks. yeah, you eat the steak, you don't just paper slices like this, and because in Paul and you know, I didn't mention that, I just come back very quick to it, the social is what they do, Paul and there's that, once became very resilient to hangar, because I, I was going to hangar to school quite often, because my mom, you had to, you cannot buy food for more than two, three, three, four days, especially bread or something, so if my mom didn't get up early in November, I'm three or three, three, three, three, three, four o'clock in the morning, I stayed in line for just, but sometimes around the block, to buy a lot of bread, I didn't, I had no breakfast, so sometimes she was in a lie or I'd for a couple hours, but then they sold our bread before she could get it, I was hungry to school, going to school, but my remedy for it was, I just find out there's a richer kids, especially those parties, party members, sons, they have always food, they have really good food, so I just beat them up and I took their flans, and I ate their lunch, and I said like you want to eat lunch, you break two sandwiches next time, so I had so much supply that I actually, I was like a robin who, because I was like to pull the guys that I knew up there and I said like I get to seal team 2, and actually they, I wanted to go to seal team 4, because I said, I don't want to be called, I know seal team 2 at a time, operate the north part and the Europe, and in Europe in general, so I say, I just want to go to like team 4, but friend of mine, say, no, no, dude, you with your language, with your Polish, Russian, and you, I speak Japanese too, so with your language, you would be good asset in this European team and stuff, so I kind of like put the such switch that from the team 4 to team 2, put team 4, second, and just like God, not put me as the visa, I just for some reason, I don't know, I was, I was not maybe that technical person at the time, and that challenges to be as the operator is twice, it is as twice, you said to me, I see, but you have to have that expertise with this mini-subs and with the operation of it, that for me, I felt was overwhelmed by that, what you need to know to be good operator in this DV teams, so I just too, and I got my orders to see all team 2, went to jump school, did you go to forebending? Yes, so they get me to Jenny Pozy and Ashwabin, so you know, I'm getting briefed, and there's, okay, so this is what we expect from you, this is what needs to happen, so this is what I raise my first alarm, I say, I'm going to sit in the fucking home via a warship happens, I'm here, I'm going with these guys, if they go, so you know, for the command, I will save this priority, so they were like, you know, well, we don't know these guys really, we know they're good, but we don't train with them, we didn't train with them that much, so we set you loose out with these guys, I mean you're taking, we are taking a chance, you can get hurt, but I said, I had no other way, so I'm going with these guys, I mean, I won't get in the respect even from the, I won't respect myself just sitting there, I won't be doing nothing, so after a lot of the bays, they say, okay, you can go with these guys, so for me it was good because I was double dipping, I was going with the gromm guys and they don't just switch my game, just go by with our guys, I switch your gear, you mean change your clothes, did you wear the gromm uniform? but I didn't know, I just, I said that's okay, I guess this is the, the way it goes, I roll with it, and the bit, another surprise for me was, so we came in, there was a couple other new guys at the same time, so when we saw him in the team, and that's okay, hey guys, at that time, in the, in the times on every Friday, we had a kegger in the high bay, so the kegger of bay, and the guys were drinking beer, so hey, when you guys, we just invite you for the kegger, and I was just, I'm sorry, into coming, join us, for the, for the, so I remember I was so taken, this is all the guys, this old Navy seals, they're so cool, you know, take these new guys, they, I'd invite for the beer and stuff, and well, I didn't know that we were, they just put them, use them, and these old new guys, then as soon as we, that, that, not soon that we just crossed the door of this bay, we just get beat up, taped up, hang up in the, on those fucking chains up, hanging like a bath, while these guys are drinking beer and just throwing the insults and I ask and stuff, hey, and I, once they, once they have to be fired, once they're brought in the lower, as down, they stick this tube in our mouth from the braggar, just pull the braggar into the, beer and the braggar bag, and just squeeze that fast as you can, so by the time, you know, you're doing so much beer, you didn't care if you hanging upside down, or no, that's it. yeah, you can do it again, so I do one more time, so I like, can I jump by myself, like, not right the way, but you have to go to the classes, so tell me about it, so here's what I said, you got a class, most likely, like, on the weekend, then you come Monday, come, you do one jump, maybe two jumps, Tuesday, Wednesday, like, like, one in two weeks, you get this enough just seven jumps, it was AFF, accelerated three four at the time, and there, so you may enough jumps, then you can graduate to jump on your own, I say, fuck, and we can restart, I say, we can start it actually this Thursday, I say, no, Friday, I say, okay, so Friday, I came ahead of all the classes, we made three jumps, Saturday, I made the next four jumps, and I was, I think Saturday evening, I was jumping on my own, so thank you three days, I was hooked, I stayed and like, four months passed, like, nobody switched anything, five months, nobody switched anything, I was like, fucking happy, I said, I can't be, I said, ain't saying shit to these guys, and so like, in the eight months, so this like 11 months, the deployment almost a year, my NVG's broke and I said, like, guys, I need some help, can you guys loan me your NVGs? Yeah, and we should, but you remember, we were leaving like our doors were opening right on the beach, so we just opened the door, because we're talking to the side, we were just like, I'm on the beach right there, so that was awesome, I mean, that, that was awesome deployment, I really liked that, and then the barrained, and there was the Christmas party, I mean, the Christmas time came, the New York came, and kind of like get us tighter and close together, and there was that 2,000 years, so that was really, really good time, and I have very fond memories of it, it's almost like a very nostalgic to me right now, it's just so, so we get done with that puttune, I know I got back, I went to college, you carried on, where did you say it team, two or two go to the different team? I didn't think about it, but it does, I remember flying over the Adriatic Sea, where we were actually on the lookout for this pilot, scatty lantern, he was sitting in there, and there, he was a sniper, so he's sitting up there and the fucking with his gun, and we'll look at it, and I think that's Bill White, look at it, say, the park, the say nothing, he's called Belle just dropped off, so he was sitting on the ledge of, I think it was, who's scary, yeah, scary off, so the ramp is open, he's sitting on the ramp, tending with his gun, he's called Belle just gone, so I think it was, I think it was a bill White, he just like sneak up, he just grabbed his ass, he's just fucking pulling him inside, he's a scatty, like what a part, he's like, dude, he almost fell out of the jet, because you know those clips, they were like easy to come and down, I mean, it's not really something that I would say safe, that they will stay, cause only, so so I say, I said, sure, you know, that's enough, I say okay, but they say it then, but now before you become a seal, you need to get a job, you have to select the job in the Navy, at the time there was no seal rating, you remember that there was, you got to boot camp, you got to A school, you got to job in the Navy and then, you got to, if you like you are assigned to go to seal training, so I say well I don't know much what I want to do, I'm part of shooting something with have I been part of shooting again, so it sounds good to me, no idea what it was, it stuck me in this field for like as a E5 for a year, so I said like okay, Okay, I mean this is like, so that's why you know, like, three months came in, but I suppose to return, I was like, I hear nothing from my commands, I'm like, fuck, I ain't saying shit either, so I keep going, I was like, they asked say, who wants to stay longer here because they have this change, but we could appreciate anything change, you know, I guess I'm here, so But you guys were inside those compound walls, and you're probably whatever, eight feet, 10 feet, 12 feet away from the blast, and so like I said, I get a little, little bit of protection, and I don't feel as much concussion, the concussion is going up, and then as soon as the breach goes, I jump over the wall and go, we go do our thing, but you know, you guys are just taking that breach on a nightly basis, taking that hammer to the brain, and look, I know there's some of them where, you know, it would be really bad, and it might knock you out, but even the ones that don't knock you out, even the ones that you just, you just suck up that thing, and it doesn't knock you out, and then you go, that thing is not good for you, like those breaches are not good for you, and who knows how many hundreds of times you just took that concussion, took that minor concussion, and over time it's definitely going to, it's going to freaking leave a mark. Yeah, it's about to deploy, and we are next, you need to come back, and so there's those no way to go around, I mean, I could, when I go maybe so much, but that time I had to come back, so they send me that, I can back to a little creek, and, I had to find this door, so that the next team is coming out, so I say, hey guys, I can go, I did not even get addicted to that stuff, I mean, you just, you can't leave in normal society, you just like, dude, I just left there, I don't like this place here, so to leave like this, I want to be there, and so I say, I go with you guys, I say, how can you use you, you know, just help us settle down with this, you're the been there for so long time, and you're with Gromso, you will help us settle down with that stuff, with Grom, and so I went, so, just for a couple of weeks, and for me, I said, And so, you know, I eventually got my clearance, so I went to the radio shag upstairs in the C02 and passed the test, a scatial into the venture, got his citizenship, so we all went out, got him to end up there, and because he was in the platinum at this time, and he got his crypto stuff too, and we moved on, so the my first platinum, as I was a member of a chief bigsner, good, good, good, I think, if this guy didn't have a hard attack yet, I think he might have it because of me, because you know, my English skills, so it was not really that good, so the ref like everything, I mean, you know, whatever you do, you know, you get to communicate, you get to communicate fast and effectively, and I just was lacking that English skills at the time. So, it was okay, so when eventually we came to the crypto and the, the, the radio communication equipment, there's, you know, the communication class, and when the crypto and we're sitting there by the time we were about to take a test from this, as I was in like, like, two more days, so that, so today was the last class, you know, how to use the cryptographic equipment, how to you, all that stuff, and so that the next day, supposed to be, I think, final exam and then there's, there's like, then move to the next section of STT, so this guy comes in, one of the instructors comes in, it's like, hey, do you have a clearance? I mean, I have like the Bruce, like fucking broke my ribs, what that fucking came from, so the ground was like, you are on your floor, we just have to kick you out of the way, because there's no way to hide, you are just there on your floor, and we, so basically they kicked me out of the way, the kick was so strong, almost broke my ribs, but you know, it's not, that's something that you accept because that's, yeah, as a breacher, man, those, those operations, like those breaches that you guys were doing, and I would usually position myself where I would be kind of with there be a wall, I would sort of put myself on top of the wall, on top of the ladder, so I could see the breach, I could see the building, I could see if there's any enemy movement, and then right as you guys would say turning steel, I would duck down. and so we went to the judge, we got like, you know, the stem we got married very quick and then I sure have on the in debt got the sworn in and Thursday I left to boot camp and didn't become the, there's like no intention to make me a seal, but you know for a little bit, I just wanted to join military, I want to contribute to the effort, I am American, I want to fight for my country, so whether being the part of the regular or whatever, I just made the best out of it, by the size of the opportunity shows up, I say why not to be a seal, I will, I will try it, and I did, I passed all the tests, so that was in boot camp and they do that, they do that, they do that day where they go okay, if you want to try for seals, you need to go take the test right now, yeah, there is a, there is a day that actually the different jobs, there's people are coming and telling about their jobs, so there are seals, you'll demotivate those show up and he talks about, I was just couldn't sit in this fucking chat room, just, get out of there, I just, You know, I do, it's like, I'm basically, they thought I'm just Iraqi trying to solicit, fucking gear to send somewhere to Baghdad in the, so I can really taste, I do the motherfucking kill you when I get, when I come back, and then, by the time I get my master chief online, so they could master chief online, some master chief, I didn't have to get some NVGs, I'm here, my broken, say, wait, wait, wait, drag, what are you, I say I'm in Baghdad master chief, it's like quite second, I was like, and how long you have been there, I say I'm like, I'm a Aussie here on deployment, and then, dude, you need to come back here, because, you know, sealed team such and such, I don't want to bring the numbers. Yeah, that was awesome, I remember just said that very beginning, we busted the bridge and I remember this captain, so hey, don't cooperate with America and see it's in Russian, don't say nothing, don't operate resistors, magic, you can, a Mr. Film that he understands it, he was over the OIC, he said, I drank a teker of it, he just grabbed the guy by the scrub, working on it, opened the house, got a big chimney with the door, I see open the door, it's like a little tiny space, so I turned in Russian, like a mother fuck, he just said another ward, I'm going to squash you right here and I'll like you after the rest of the journey, he's just looking at this little tiny space here, I'll fuck up, but there's no fuck with these guys, okay, no problem, we never had a problem with this guy again, so yeah that's, I remember for me, I wanted to join this 220 pounds, so I'm working so hard and I'm just like, I have a pound bowl, how the pound bowl, like, two, 19, 2018, I say fuck, give me that lot of bread right there, so I was just like, I weigh myself, maybe I had these few grams to get this 220 pounds, I just chow and down, push myself into that bread myself, like, getting the scale, 220 and a half, it's like, fucking, I'm to 220 pounds club, now I wish I could get to the 220 pounds from the other side, so then, when I showed up at team 2, what was it, was that your fourth platoon? that was a good workout, that was a really good platoon, good deployment too, I mean, I really enjoyed, I just thought we went to Spain, we hijacked the Russian tanker too, that was it, that was it, you know, now when I look back at it after my experience in combat, I'm sure you too, it's not really that big deal, but at that time there was like holy shed with not only hijacked the Russian tanker, vulgon eff, it was vulgon eff, we fast rope on that too, I remember the funny thing, Stu is, you remember who would look ships like that because there was a Russian tanker, so they're those regular, they just to clarify everyone for the English translation, when, when drugless as we hijacked the Russian tanker, we actually didn't hijacked the Russian tanker, there was a tanker, a Russian tanker that was smuggling oil out of the Gulf and one of the missions that we had while we were over there, we stopped people from smuggling stuff out of the Gulf, most of the time we were taking down little, little dows, little tiny boats and we would take those things down, we took down a bunch of them too, but then this was the biggest catch that we got was this big oil tanker that we, that we took the Russian flag, and I remember the funny thing is even, I remember we did the shifts later, right, because that was not comfortable, so let's keep seals on it, so just bobbing on this boat, bobbing on this boat, but I remember, so when we took it down, we came back and then the next shift came back next day, the other squad, when they came back, so you just left a bunch of weapons with them, there is so much fog, we took all this, the weapons that you guys left, I was like, what the weapons did we leave up there, I mean, what's the search that boat, what's now to be, when they went up there, they see those little butterflies, the butterflies, the butterflies, they just fucking took it away from this guy, so when we went back, these guys are coming in, I spoke Russian, you know, I'm like, yeah, so say hey, a Mr. please help us, we have no teeth and we can't eat because these guys told our force and our knives, so we can, I cannot chew and this is up there, really, maybe two or three teeth, sticking out of the mouth and this is all they had, Yes, for me it was kind of fun time, because when I was growing up, I was poor, I never had a chance to go through this nail-eyed or this type of thing, I could watch over the fans, I shielded and were playing around it, but I couldn't afford it, so when I got into this tower, I was like holy shit, this is like a decennial idea, so I didn't care what the position he would meet to jump, I just like, I had a bloody hour to read, and yeah, that kind of didn't like it, but they are very rigid, so I remember two of those, they had a lot of fun too, because I think you went through the same thing, so there is a forbending, so you stare next to each other, shoulder to shoulder, so close, that basically you cannot even move, and then you just go to your line, you grab the line, they drag you just do the PLI, if I could never do the PLI, that was only scared of PLI. I think can, just go get your medic or record from your, from your medical office, bring it here, we take a look at it, so I ran up there and I said, what magic you'll come up with, I'm sure there's some paragraph or some regulation that will help that bypass this to put kids, so I brought this record, and I said, I was right, right there, right there, I was just, I want you to leave the room here, I'll just call you in a second, and I could hear a rip, so he comes back, so the kidnaged stone, where is that, I was like, right, oh, so he's like, I don't see any, I don't see any either, should he had the kidnaged stone, it's like, you know, maybe not, maybe I didn't, okay, I remember you showed up and it's like, I remember I had the swim with you, this before even we platoon up, so we just wanted to dive the swim, and I see well you had a big guy, so I don't think you'd be swimming the fast, so I think I'm saved with you, I'd be alright, and it's okay, I want to look at me, I say, okay, that's your boy, you swim with the boy, and I was like, okay, and so again, the water, you drag, that boy you drag and drag me and that boy with you, I just could not keep up, I mean, that was like, what is fucking guy, he's taking the... Yeah, I also remember those guys, they were telling us that we didn't do a good job clearing or whatever they were saying, because they still, because we were like, oh yeah, they have, they have butterflies and stuff like that, and they're like, don't worry, we secured it, and we were sailing, we were on a Navy ship looking at the ship that we took down, and I'm looking, I was like, there's the camps to my mind, there's always, there's something that's some situation that you can get killed, and if you look over the statistics, I think from there before the war, I think we were killing like two guys in training every year, as the average I think was like, when I'm looking out with the disguided eye, this guy was killing, in training, this white was killing, in training, he was like, one or two guys every year, yeah, for sure, no, there's definitely you're doing stuff every day, whether it's parachuteing, diving, shooting, you're always doing something in computer, that can give you a bad day, or make you fall out of helicopter, because your belt came off, Come on with me, you know, so we end up there and say like, don't, so we're like, look at that, I was like, never say anybody that you went to this class, you just don't say nothing, don't say anything, you, you never sit in that class, it's like, okay, you guys get your cleanances then go, we, we'll redo it and so, But when I show up in the teams, you know, you are the new sailor, I was a new sailor, everyone I won, the bootcamp, the A-school, you know, the bots, everyone was so formal, so, so, you know, I buy the book and everything, so I show up and buy that, I can't even know, like five minutes later, I'm hanging on the pool of bar in my blues and the fucking doing pull ups, running three miles, fucking, I do my PRT in my tank, and, and so, what the fuck, by the time I've been, you know, what do you realize what's going on, I had completed the whole PRT in my blues and stuff, that was just, I was the new guy, Well, the, the, the problem was that I could swim only on one side, and I never swim with the mask on, so either they dump you in the pool and say, I want you to swim here, there's a sidestroke, sidestroke, this is how you do it, and the Buds do, we swimming all the styles that we tell you to do, and I was going to ever play with it, but when they put them put the mask on, after the first couple of laps, I thought I would pass out, I mean, I was like hyper ventilating, I was blocking out, I see the black spazzing for myself, I bought a die here, but then so if I stop they kick me out, so I ain't stopping I see, I know that if I pass out, they will rescue me, that's as guys everywhere, they tell us that we are safe, so we are safe, so I was blocking out, I felt about to black out, but having these black spots, but it became easier, and easier by the time, like the next hour, I was like shit, they're in that bed, I can do it. yeah, that was a good time, but I tell you, I have to say one more thing here, I remember Robo Niel, he was in our platoon, my very good body and at the time, where I got best friends, and I remember he was a sniper on this OIC, I got angry to happen, I think to you, I'm looking over to you, and I remember as we moved through the Shreva, as we said, I said, I know Robo's up there, and I think shit is going to happen to me, I know he'd take down that anybody who's on that one way, so it makes me very comfortable. yeah, you know, you can be a seal, it's like, but into good those paper war from these guys, we put you in the Navy and you okay, and then they were just putting the Navy, you will be a seal then, I say okay, so I went and like it's the horse, I'm going there, so can I have it, they were pissed, they did not like it, So it's like, let's like fuck you, you know, it's like, and it's like, got quiet. yeah, that's also, I mean, there are a couple of weeks, as much as I can get, so we flew up there, and this like, four months later, it's like, hey, drag away, you need to come back, we are deploying too much, so something like this, and you need to be back into the junior platoon, so I say, okay, so I'm, as much as you're going on the way, so I came back in town around and came back again with the, with the, with my, with my, what's the 134. So it is important that you do that, and hopefully people are doing it, because you know, that eventually become a book, and maybe you want to share the parent or the spouse, want to share with us the other person that we don't know, because most of us know that the guy, like, fucking warrior, he goes up there, he kills the bad guys, he does what needs to be done, but there's also another side to each of us, and we don't know that side of these people who didn't come back. so yeah, we just see that so next day we see that, we're guys watching, running through the field, you know, with that equipment sitting here, that I've been doing the crypto stuff and, and as I was watching you know, there's like shit, I mean there's not the difficult, I could pass the test now, science is already out of the went through all this class, I don't know, it was a big deal, but I guess they don't want us, they don't want anybody to know that we sat through this class, not getting the secret clearance. so I was skydiving by this time, but but it seems like coming from Poland, coming from not having food from being in prison, from all these things that are going on, it seems like when you get to America, you've just got this, this like drive just to live and make things happen and you're going to free fall and I did use couple times that I, you know, like we we're supposed to we're going explosive bridge to the door, that we look the Intel pictures and there was like, okay, okay, so this is how we plan, you know, we prepare all the the briefs, this is where we hide, this is what I saw, element is going to be, there's a breacher, so there's what I'm going to go blow the door, this is how we go. It is a council, but you know, you can translate Grom actually as a thunder, it is thunder, it's thunder, it's a crony for actually group of reacting, I don't know, I can say this, so it does stand for something in fall, it does sound something, but it also means thunder, it's thunder, yes, it's a little seal, seal, it means like an animal, right, right, and then I'll seal, but it's not really what it is, yeah, so the Grom, the Polish Grom, had deployed to Baghdad, they were actually co-located with the seals, that were also in Baghdad, and they needed someone to be liaison between the Polish Grom and the seals that were there, and of course, everybody kind of knows or had run into or someone knew that there was a Polish guy or a American guy that could speak Polish, that grew up in Poland, that was in the seal teams, they track you down, they give, they contact through your chain command and boom, you get the call, how long do you take from the call to you fly over there? I did not before they joined Army, why did you try the Navy, just go and ask recruiters about seals, I was like seals, what was the seals, yeah, but the Navy, this cool guy, I'm jumping the coldens of seals, so I'll just go and ask hey, I went in the next door, I said like I'm applying here for Army and they have all my paperwork, but I met some friends who told me to ask about the Navy, I'm just asking about the Navy, who those friends are, I said like they're coming to serve seals, I tried one time and just put my shoulder and I like, if I can't even get them more, so every time I jump I just stood up, I just, I was not a big deal, because I was here in the hundreds of jumps at the time, so I just jump out, just a little bit of land, just stand up and just like, so this little, the head of those black, black heads, the head of the cubes, PLF, private, PLF, PLF, how to see PLF was like, Roger that, and this gentleman, throw my parachute and just roll on the ground, see that, I can't even feel that. I was actually watching it as it happens, and I remember I was working hours in the gym, and they say the airplane hit the towers, I was like what the fucking idiot, some just flew into the thing, but then I was like, as the, you know, the news progress, and they say like there was a, not, there was a jet line, it was not a small airplane, I just put my attention No, no, no, no, no, I would wear our uniform, but then change my, like, you've used the gas in, so it's really, really, it's a stuff, really, a lot of pressure, and go with our, I sometimes don't, the fly, it will on the fly because like, we're at the time, it was like, so the gromm hit the target and we moved to another target, just switch the cars and go with the by-road guys, so I had a gap some of these missions, that's pretty good, I think, we can live in the dream. So it is so important to write the books about these guys, who are not here anymore, because they can write their own book, we need to engage parents, that was also a style of parents, of our guys, look, they might not seem like a lot, but they are, you way gap, and you know, the pain doesn't go away, just leave to learn with it, as a parent, as a spouse, but what you can do, it's just write little things that you remember, that's your way gap, it's like, And so they brought the, the, the format from the Porsche, first he looked at me and like, and I know there's like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, just like, we can have a guy, guy that he means speaking English. so so I was listening to BBC how old how old are you that time I think I was 12 13 14 so as I was getting all that and there was getting more interested in what's going on this when I learned that you know that the social is actually quite killing people who are in convenient to them or those people disappear like we don't know where this guy is. yeah, you filled that out, so it's no big, I'm going to hit your bags, I'm going to hit your bags, and that's why anytime now, so, well nothing happens, the guys like drag, I don't think this the right way to do it, the right, but you should surely want to go and to war, man, there's a war going going up there, I say, So it's like, you're a beat three times funny like I said, I guess they say, like, fuck, they ain't going to sit. So I say fuck, I mean, I'm like, I'm like, I'm getting 45, I'm getting old guy, and I don't know where even girls, you know, I don't have anybody. so, so just so people know what you're talking about, you say the test isn't that hard to pass, the bait, the seal test that we used to get to get a chance to go to seal training was like, I think it was, you had to do, it's some minutes ago, it's like 50 pushups, 50 minutes, 50 set ups and two minutes, eight pull ups, 10 pull ups, 11, 11 pull ups, and then a mile and a half run in 11, 30 and a 500 yards swim. Because you saw immerse into that combat, into that time there, again, this became like a dream, then you come back and it's like, well, that's actually in real, you know, that's, but also be really, I never realized that think over your head, they always want to get shot. There's not even hot yet, there's not even hot yet, I mean like June, it's gonna calm, yeah, and then July and August it's on, but even May you're like getting there like, No, really, I didn't know that the physical demands of the seal teams at the time, I was just like, what about just in life like, when you were working, when you were working, you were freaking soft, you were getting a kickboxing tech one though, yeah, that's basically what? it is there, you know, but like now you hear the fact, when you think about the fairytale, some you know, snow-wide or something, it sounds really great, but it's just like a fairytale. yeah, I just show up, so what he's talking about there is, he shows up at in his dress uniform, when you check into a new command, you're in your dress uniform, it's a nicest uniform you've got, and you don't, you know, normally you'd wear it for like a ceremony, so he shows up with that uniform on and they're like, cool, we're gonna do a physical physical, what is it? But then I was like, this is the guy that originally said, ah, it's because when my kids were to work out, I'd be like, hey, look, when you're going to go for that big clean, you've got to get fired up. So you and me to send equipment to you somewhere in Baghdad, I say, to compose, you have composed, so, and who you are, so you, who you, who the drag who you are, who, it's like, I'm just drag, you know, I'm sealed team, guy and team guy, it's like, dude, don't even speak English. It was interesting, like, when we were there together and just to give everyone an idea of what was going on, so the grom, there would, there would be intelligence from various sources coming down, and we would kind of go out and capture kill bad guys, and sometimes we were basically rotating back and forth between grom and the pull to seal, pull to grom, seal, pull to and sometimes there would be two targets, and we just go out together, and or if it was a really big target, we'd go out together, and maybe grom would be external security and the seals would do the assault, or maybe seals would be external security and grom would do the assault, and I don't remember, you're going to have to correct me, but I don't remember many of them speaking English. So this is like when when I look at American fly something like taking my heart and it's like, this is so free. I didn't happen Poland, Poland I remember I was seven, eight years old, I was driving across the town thinking bars crossing the streets going to somewhere else and there it was like there's no big deal all the kids there would just ten miles away from school where we have to commute and we're just coming here there was like no big deal my mom would just bought me a ticket. that's okay, and so then I went to A school, and the A school I met, resin piece, bless barriers, I don't know if you knew him, but so bless barriers, he was a motivator in million, and when I was going to the my parish of the school, I said, look, I passed the test, I think I can easily pass it again, but I had this kidnaged on, and I cannot, I just want to be a seal, so it's anyway, maybe there's some maybe paperwork and we don't, people, people say, people work, yeah, So what is it just like some weird, like, claustrophobic thing on your face or something like that? I was like, I was like, when the wind sweeps that dial, he'd be like, Brittany, right? The final thing is that I, on my, on this last tour, and I was there, the, the army guy comes up to me, like, I don't know him from Adam, I was like, I never just arrived in the guy, he can't say, he did, have you been here in 2003?
