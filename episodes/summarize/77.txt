So you have the back shore party, you know the two guys there have the officer and a couple other guys Picking up the stakes put the stakes out and that's usually photographers the obbure way out ahead of everybody else Taking the back shore information so that when you come back and do your Degraphic chart, you know you can lay it out exactly then you have to do it leave or you pan I was a good talker for I know all this good, so which I hated you know because you had to man make Hand draw the maps your hand drawing that and those those those charts that you draw You're gonna present those are gonna get presented to you know the Navy and they're gonna use those charts to conduct this landing You know like we was on this one bolt one time and we saw these 60 guys they were they had 60s on a boat you know they had these Big metal containers at the rounds when we were lucky and it was a flex tube that went into the 60 and so Couple k bars later we walked off with a couple of those and they were fit perfect in the back of it Prec 70 seven backpack We could put them on held 500 rounds and you had the flex tube that went right into your 60 Yeah, to have a special feed tray for you know me know it's feed tray the The feed tray was right on the end of the flex tube so it's set right in their perfect They just hit our group And you know, that was a that was a bad day in dark city, but it you know It got hit really bad, but Managed to get to the shore and put some of the guys off and stuff and it was I think it was gonna be a Pincher movement where they came out for people because they dropped the other guys way off and there were three UDG guys on that Group and then there was three of us on the group that when we got hit and your main mission was gonna be demo if Yeah, We're figuring them out ourselves most of the time Yeah, well, I can see the difference from my first platoon or we didn't have anything and my second Platoon where we actually worked off of actually an actionable intel that we got it was like night and day I would do it's a whole different world and just like we talked about before we started this you know you got your fine You got your fix and then you got your finish and Exploitation of you know what I mean, but that we're the best in the world. and he came up to me with his map and asked me where he was You know and that kind of I went and that's the second lieutenant He's leading up Platoon or Squad of guys in you know that kind of you know him saying I just don't know I don't know my thought of that was is We were trained I had a barrel coordination of exactly where their round was gonna go but even regardless you always worked it in Doesn't it wasn't a It's gives me a point weapon like m14 You know, it was a it's an area weapon, but still you can get pretty accurate with that some of the bitch and you'd always walk you around Because what you know rounds with the chain off kid Hit a guy just as well as get him right squirons chest or something and I use canteen pouches and I carried five campy canteen pouches around my waist and I put a hundred rounds there and leave about a Ninch out of that got it Then when I food fired and I knew I was getting low I'd pop my lid open on my Canna had grab my thing of my 60 rounds snap men and dump them in and close it or The lid when it opened up had ridges on the side that would slide right in just dependent, you know so I'll take the desert of the mountains but those are the things You know you know I always say that I always talk about seeing my guys lined up to go out and Remoddy and their their home visa lined up and like if I wasn't going on the hop There's just like platoon is going out and I'd stand there Just I salute them like as they were leaving you know We've been going for like two hours right now just um I want to get one more question Some some people Listen to the podcast that want to go in the sealed teams and You know any sort of Thought on what they should be thinking about when they're trying to get in or trying to go fast me all the time You know I would say real simple stuff you know like hey do a bunch of pull ups push ups dips swim run and don't quit and You know we're coming in what we do is two guys to branch out to the right or left to get anybody from behind The rest one would go in one guy would turn around look that way and the guys that go in and that way they can shoot You know 180 you know me and nobody was down now if the hooch was covered and had foliage around it Then as we came in one of the guys and the left would go down lay down look behind the other guy'd be right here at the corner Yeah, some reason a lot of people ask me if you've ever worked with foreign troops Everyone want to kind of kind of want to know what we think of their countries and their troops, you know, and you know the brits and the Aussies You know the S.A.S. or top chill for the first year The only ones that went out with us on patrol okay I got to wake up at 430 you know when the insurgent is gonna come it's gonna come at 430 You got to work out at 830 or 5 or whatever time you know when the weakness might come so you can be ready for it That diet thing you just don't know this is what I'm saying so nonetheless any moment of weakness this is what you do you? So anyway we got our six-by and was heading out when over where the seawall guys were we won the drink with us, you know We had our sixies with stuff you never knew you know, so we get over there and go walking in their compound and everything all right boys get up Let's drink well, see we made them drink with this naked Because we were all naked so we're all sitting there drinking beers Nakedness M60s and booze a like where this is going Yeah, you guys had way much more fun and We were the only ones that went out with them You know, and it all started out with a couple of sask guys drinking the bar with a couple of our guys and Pupar paths and telling tall tales and you know drinking bears and shit and I think you know we have this exchange and it's been on going Yeah, and so you learned all that you know I mean all you learned what you had to have or your gear you had like we'd do Sort of cool stuff where there are 60s and yet to see where we needed to have the Floatation and stuff like that you know to me and it was pretty good actually when I went out to New Island We didn't even have the camp out there We had in Island itself the town there was a gas station and had about four or five Green little green trailers and that's where we stayed at Well the platoon before us that was there and stuff that that was Platoon those years gotten a lot of shit You know, so I mean you got his metal wand or stuff like that and actually my second trip over Had been in that platoon year on a mean and yeah, tell me some stories about they got a lot of shit Just you know the the EOD guys that we had nowadays in the sealed teams the guys that come in They they go through work up with a very awesome You can't you couldn't if someone normal person was watching they wouldn't be able to tell who's the OD and who's not in at least when you're in a Remoddy and that's what most of you guys are like but my EOD guys talking about not wanting to go over there My EOD guys they would they would put together briefs of like the latest The latest ID's that's been out there. It's a process because you can't just have like two guys saying hey We should get, um, you know, I don't know something earrings or something in another guy's Yeah, that's no one other story don't ask oh, so you made my point for me So paths were one of those ones where there was a lot of people saying we need a or we should have hats That would be cool and people were like Because it was just partly out of the waters up, but they you know and pissed us off for underwater demolition was like you know Devied TF you know That's what we do you know, I think I think we have a lot of good stuff on there, but Only way if you're gonna find out is to go to jockelstore.com and find out for yourself if you're in the mood get something like that Or get something that's on there and it will support the podcast also Good way to support yourself in your journey journey Are we doing journey or you've been doing it to see you know, I know, but I just I have mixed still my own thought It was still not comfortable. You know me we'd uh You know more about the urban stuff than I do because they never fought or but you know We'd hit who it is and stuff like that, but we never swept through uh we did one village one time But when you got setups guys dropping pamphlets in saying You know, we may be doing something this area You know all the good guys leave and stuff like that Nine months is a long time but still you know, but actually back in the day Civic bay was almost worse than Vietnam in Samaris because it was almost like the gangsters back in Chicago You had all these different gangs right after each other in shit and when you was walking down McSysai you almost had a look around the corner this if you know they were shooting at each other before you walk by and shit It was uh it was pretty Kind of like the wild wild west They would take a thin branch or stick you know real thin like just like when you're fishing you can feel a bite on the line They would take that and they would hold it kind of in the center and as we're moving slow They'd move at any time that thing Dept they had reached out and feel it like a lot of other times if you're going down a trail Which isn't a really good idea anyway, but you step over a log sometimes they'd put a pressure detonated stuff over that log if you're stepped on it You know exactly where the guy is gonna be and what you're gonna do whether it's a peel off or whether you're going to the right or left You know me getting out of the the fire zone whatever you know And they got that training and they're the ones that were the category for that set and Like my lab first platoon in 69 my whole platoon went through most of that before we deployed over So you get all that stuff we didn't get the fieldcraft portion of it, but they had some great really good Quick kill trails and stuff like that and that would encompass everything you know to me yet That we know not everybody had a camera and not everybody You know had a video can these guys got video cameras now they got helmet cams they got all the stuff
