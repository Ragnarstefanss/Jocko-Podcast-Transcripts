I'll put it into like some other time anyway Krill oil is dope pre-workouts dope Everything on it is good actually Just depends on what kind of workout program or kind of lifestyle, you know, but they have something for everybody Like we're gonna do even the krill oil even if you're not that active It's just good for your joints, you know as like because over time you teach generate, you know whatever krill oil regenerate Also, another way to support is subscribe on iTunes or the various Podcast platforms stitcher Google play all these things if you subscribe you haven't already, you know that's a good support, you know We've got to hold I wondered how I made my voice so convincing I wanted a throw away the platoon phone and the batalion radio and everything connected with the War and bury my head in my hands and cry cry cry The infantry assault upon the other platoons continued the sound of the battle reached a height which I had never thought possible before but burst of the 88 millimeter shells in the woods Vide with the sound of hundreds of lesser weapons it couldn't last forever I thought it must stop Sometimes it must stop but when and how I Look toward the draw between me and the highway about 20 men were walking down the draw toward the rear I recognize several men from the light machine gun section in a machine gun crew from M company the other which were riflemen from first platoon I did not know where they were going all I knew is at somehow I must stop them I jumped from the slit trench and ran toward them ignoring the crack of bullets through the trees waving my arms and shouting for a them to stop They turned to look at me with vague blank expressions They seemed to wonder who was this crazy man who wanted them to do this foolish thing I saw that it was the entire left flank of first platoon the thin lines of the remainder of the platoons would soon be cut off from the rear The 60 millimeter mortar men a few yards away a few yards away were dismantling their weapons I managed to get my moot to get them in to move to my CP He shouted we may be able to hold them up for a while While some of the others get out I could not see what good we could do from this position, but I was taking commands now and I took cover alone in a fox hole in the edge of the woods facing the highway It was good to let someone else do the thinking for a while even if I disagreed with the decision I was not afraid instead I was strangely apathetic to the whole of fair The Germans were hot on our tails so what they'd been a hot on my tail for almost as long as I could remember now and they had cut my company to ribbons They might as well get me to German infantry men emerge from the thicket We had left such a short time before and milled around to US abandoned US tanks parked in the open beside the forest A company and machine gunner private first class Jose and Lopez of Brownsville, Texas set up his gun beside a hole five feet to my rear He opened up on the German infantry with the blast of muzzle the blast of muzzle force me to sink to the bottom my hole for cover The Germans wasted no time in returning fire riddling the area around the machine gun in my fox hole with a bird gun and rifle fire A tiger tank appeared at the road junction where the where the battalion had been shelled the night before and fired point blanket Lopez's exposed position The long barrel of the 88 on the tank seemed to reach half the distance from the hole to my fox hole Lopez continued to fire An American Jeep with two eight men their red Geneva crosses painted on their helmets tore down the highway from the direction of russia Wrath toward the road junction. I was filled with a growing fear that the Germans might hit us with a counter attack I decided that the enemy must surely know that the troops were moving in and would attempt to dislodge us while while we might still be disorganized 11 men in a pill box 11 men who must live from day to day never thinking of the immediate future but only of the in infinity When the war would someday be over There was Sparky and first Sergeant Albin Savage blackburned Crot 2 and me there was private first class Willie Haggin the tobacco chewing 39-year-old Army regular who kept us laughing with sage tactical wisdom and Served as first-platoon runner Then there was private first class Angelo Boutare of Boston Second-platoon runner who had lost two brothers in the war already Private first class Hubert Burger of Memphis Tennessee third-platoon runner who's 18 years old and red is Bible every night Private first class Kenneth Lampton of Detroit Michigan weapons platoon runner who is also 18 and corresponded with college girls from Michigan And private first class Erling G. Sauberg of Fargo North Dakota who is 19 and cleanly good looking And the headquarters bazooka man The cooks and Jeep drivers the supply sergeant in the mail orderly had been left behind with the service company to keep us supplied The changing of the guard at four o'clock revealed that it was raining outside a slow cold miserable drizzle I thought of the men in the Ford platoons in their exposed fox holes with no protection from the elements except shelter Half stretched across their holes and nothing between them and the hostile killers in front of us but the muzzles of their own rifles I had admired the unglamorous infantry soldier before but as the rain continued to fall and the night grew colder My pride at being a part of this dirty miserable infantry new there I mean, I'm just obviously going on the last one, but Like you learn like scenarios, you know that the Q and A part is Straight up golden because everyone comes like hey, I had this scenario that's been basically plaguing me For a year and it's just causing problems here and you know and everyone has their own one and while they're all unique They all kind of overlap with each other and and you guys are like okay, this way you do this way You do this is the answer and it's like And what I like about that is he points out that You know from his perspective all this stuff is going on he realizes that these guys That's the whole world to them right that sergeant that was killed that's their guy and their war is Everything to them and it's just like when you meet people you know if you're to business and you go and meet someone on the front lines like they don't care I'm not saying they don't care, but they've got their whole world in What they're doing So you got to be cognizant of that you got to understand that I hastily decided to continue the rear out of the line of fire of the wrecked attack upon the German Position from a less respected restricted spot We moved toward the rear two men supporting Charles with his arms about his with his arms about their shoulders A sudden burst of small arms fire came from our right rear And the woods echoed to the crack of machine gun rifles the fire was coming from the direction of the defensive Position at the junction of the fire breaks which we had left bullet wind low over our heads And buried themselves into the trees and snow around us My first thought that was was that K company contacted our rear elements and thinking they were Germans had open fire We heard battalion talking on the radio asking K company what they what time they wanted to pick up their bed rules for the night We've got no use for bedding rolls K company answered it was lieutenant flame. But you know when you do notice it and in my experience even more If you pay attention is like for like like two few days ago I'm sitting down on the living room with like the kids You know we're seeing we're sitting there for a long time same positions like for 45 minutes Usually after 45 minutes and But he's weighing it in his head The the flanking position through the woods in order to flank he needs to put his guys through the woods through an area He doesn't know doesn't know how well it's defended so he says you know what instead of doing a flank which is what I want to do I'm just gonna put down some artillery fire We're gonna do a frontal assault they get shut down and eventually he does make the decision You know what the bet the decision now becomes okay front all salt is not gonna work now. Oh God if we could but rush from the house into the attack without thinking again It was the waiting and the thinking and the wondering that got you Talked about that before That fear that you're feeling It's the waiting it's the hesitation and he's saying hey if we could just go from this house that I'm sitting right now right into the attack That's what he'd prefer to do But he can And now they're moving to the attack is Is full on now the last man in the forward positions crossed the crest of the small hill They should be almost inside the first house is a bend or from now I thought I Holded the CP grouping the sun can trail running across the crest of the hill until junior to ask a report from the assault platoon Suddenly a tank fired from somewhere to a front a big show a show word over or low over our heads a machine gun chattered Around of tank fire rip from the limb from the tree above our head a burp gun Said burp burp there was no question now we had hit their defenses the Germans to head tanks I Was trembling slightly from the excitement, but I was not as definitely afraid as I had once been in the pillbox positions The opinion often expressed amongst some GIs that ever after any man was wounded once He was never any good in combat again did not hold true in my case I was more calm than ever before So You do your Amazon shopping like we always do daily For some of those Instead of going straight to Amazon just go to jocobotcast.com little Amazon banner on the side you kind of got to scroll down If you want to hit the banner sometimes, but I put it up in the top menu as well Boom click on the Amazon banner Then do your shopping good way to support Like jocos said just you know little actually do that if you want if if that's what you're doing if you're supporting the I'm gonna ask them. We can do it look at what these guys went up against Day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day just doesn't stop It just doesn't stop and the whole time by the way there's the threat of death By the way the whole time Freezy you know I just thought about this like this is a book where he doesn't even talk about like his family He doesn't talk about his love. I jumped into the slit trench with savage and black burn Request after request for artillery and mortar support came from the platoon leaders I called for every concentration listed on my overlay and for variations of each so that little thing I was talking about when you call in for these concentrations you got two two three and this one and that one He's just calling for all of them calling for all of them because bomb everything The inevitable maddening three rounds belly time so they're trying to concern in the rear They're trying to conserve up conserve ammunition so they're firing three rounds at a time And he's due to get due to get due to get but the two leaders begged for an Italy for more I began on one side of the company Area and called for concentrations all across our front and back again Lieutenant Sawyer called for a barrage after barrage of 81 millimeter mortar fire the crack of small arms reached an ear splitting crescendo crescendo like static on a forgotten radio during an electric storm I lay flat on my back in the slit trench that will tune phone to one year the receiver of the battalion radio on the other The chill from the frozen earth seep through my clothes and I shivered That's the situation therein a shallow draw Later the front of my rifle platoons with a higher ridge rising beyond it over which the enemy would soon be coming Another draw led up to my left flank protected by two light machine guns in a few riflemen in position Which no man in his right mind would place machine guns unless he had no other method of defending the probable enemy approach These guys are in a horrible situation our right flank lacks a right flank lack 50 yards of tying in with K company along a fire break which by sector the highway We had no anti tank defense Except two Sherman tanks and a bazooka with three rounds of ammunition We were being supported by a 99th Division artillery and outfit about which we knew nothing except this was their first action Except for holding a quiet defensive sector for a month But there was nothing that could be done now, but wait At 1030 a Jeep loaded with men clipped down the highway toward the rear at breakneck speed That would be the van guard of the retreating battalion from the 99th They're not gonna complain They're starting to improve We got a warning here to aggressive do not drink at work literally lip the ripped the door trim off the wall after Consuming this victory in a glass luckily Since getting after it is my new default mode I was able to repair the damage before the boss noticed Replace pathetic this is my best part out of the best part of this one replaced Pathetic screws with lag bolts, you know lag bolts are they're like instead of a screw Which is like a little tiny pencil thing a lag bolt is a big bolt that you like surreal. The riflemen could not be sure if the next troops that appeared over the ridge were friendly or enemy I alerted the artillerymen to call for fire in the event the approaching troops were German Lieutenant Brock's call came a few minutes later scarcely preceding a hail of small arms fire Which sounded like the crack of thousands of riot force echoing through the forest There was no doubt now my men could see the build caps of the approaching troops They were Germans And you know we're gonna get to a point As I go through these books and I highlight little sections and I read that little section I'm about to get to a point here shortly Where I'm just gonna read the whole damn section because it's it's so much oh Yeah, that's a good for sure, but let's say you watch I don't know doctor fill Not that I watch doctor fill, but if you watch that's all they're doing they're sitting this guy's talking to this person and you're just watching You could listen to that you're saying I'm just saying if you're into doctor fill that the difference between looking and And watching it and just listening to it like You understand that people actually do watch two people talk about stuff makes sense You kind of feel like you'd be more in the conversation in a way. So now he starts he links up with savage sergeant savages his senior enlisted guy He sees him back to the book savage and I ran for each other like two college girls suddenly reunited smiles read their faces We both tried to talk at once he had heard that I've been killed I had not known what to become of him I jumped back to the fox hole after you said get the radio as he explained to length first thing I knew there were Germans all over the place they made me come out and took my watch and and moved me over to the highway Where they had two other GIs then one of our artillery barages started falling the crowds hit the dirt I grabbed one of their burp guns and started spraying and we ran like hell all three of us got away The attackers who had dislodged first platoon could not have reached us so quickly Cowan began to spit machine gun fire across the north narrow firebrik and I heard German heard a German scream with pain the headquarters men fired their carbines and pistols into the low hanging branches The fur trees to the right were too thick to see the area where the rifle platoons were supposed to be going into Position I wonder if they had been able to build up any semblance of a line Around came from an enemy tank broke The top of the small fur tree above Cowan's head sending him reeling from the gun But he jumped back and continued to fire I knew that the big tigers had reached the junks in the fire break in the highway Hales of enemy bullets thrashed the snow and the fur and the trees around us the fur trees around us I duck beneath the cover of my foxhole trying to get battalion on the radio but without success I stood up and looked out of the hole great god. How they did it is you know, you know even the the word double blind plus seat or placebo Situation whatever like a lot of people they know what that is what it is is they get a bunch of group of people who are gonna work out hard going for games straight up Nothing but time time born of the bodies of dead men Time Seven times the enemy infantry assaulted and seven times they were greeted by a hail of small arms fired Hand grenades that sent them reeling down the hill leaving behind a glowing pile of dead and wounded But with all that's at the attacks seemed poorly organized There was no supporting artillery or mortar fire on our positions and I wondered why they had not yet found the open flank on our left There was only the suicidal wave of fanatical infantry men who being and yelling and brandishing their rifles like men possessed I looked at my watch. I wanted a cigarette I felt like we were helpless little bugs scurrying blindly about now that some man monster had lifted the log under which we had been hiding I wondered if it would not be better to be killed and perhaps that would be an end to everything That's the section right there that like I said I mean you just can't I couldn't skip anything in there It's too much stuff going on and to hear what it's like from his perspective of being overrun They could boast a glorious combat record already and I knew nothing Suddenly all my long hours of training for just such a role as this seemed pitifully inadequate If only there were some way I could know just what it was like It seemed incredible at this group of hardened combat veterans could accept me is it an In inexperienced youth of 21 to lead them into battle simply because he happened to come to them wearing a set of flashy bars on his shoulders For me I could look into their minds and see what they were thinking So you can see this guy is definitely Feeling what just about everyone moving into a leadership position feels which is I'm not ready for this and I don't know everything and as I've said a bunch of times That's okay.
