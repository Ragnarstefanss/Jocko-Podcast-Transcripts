[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 282 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, Echo.
[00:00:07] A 44-year-old, what man was among those involved in a three-day fight recently as part of Operation
[00:00:16] Adelboro in Vietnam? He is Charles F. Wittis, who is stationed at Fort Sill until June with
[00:00:25] the fourth battalion, 30th Infantry, and now serves as a platoon sergeant in Vietnam with
[00:00:31] company A, 1st Battalion, 27th Entry, Infantry, 25th Infantry Division. The 24-year Army
[00:00:40] Veterans' wife, Florence, and children Pat, David Sharon Gary, and Wanda, reside in
[00:00:48] Latin. A married daughter lives in Litchfield, Minnesota. Operation Adelboro was not the first
[00:00:55] time sergeant Wittis has seen action. As he served with the first Infantry Division during
[00:01:03] World War II and saw action in North Africa, Sicily, the Normandy invasion, France, Belgium,
[00:01:11] Luxembourg, German-Nee, and Chexlovakia.
[00:01:17] So he had some combat experience. He also served in Korea with the Intelligence and Reconnaissance
[00:01:23] Platoon of the 19th Infantry Regiment 24th Infantry Division. Operation Adelboro has been
[00:01:29] described as the biggest US action of the Vietnam War. The 43-day operation involves some
[00:01:35] 25,000 American soldiers in the jungles of Tainin province northwest of Sagan. A cracked
[00:01:43] open on the toughest and oldest of the Hong Kong strongholds. The campaign ended last
[00:01:48] Saturday with a claimed bag of more than 1,100 communist regulars killed and nearly 2400
[00:01:57] tons of rice captured plus hordes of other supplies.
[00:02:02] I don't think that the fighting out there was as bad as in itself as either World War II
[00:02:08] or Korea, but this was much more confusing. In Korea, you at least had lines over here.
[00:02:15] They were all around you. Sergeant Wittis said, at first I thought we'd run into a platoon
[00:02:21] on patrol. But when the fighting continued, I knew we'd run into a much stronger force.
[00:02:27] I don't really have time to think about what was going on. My time was spent getting wounded
[00:02:32] out and getting the ammo to the men. Those assaults were the first I'd seen since Korea.
[00:02:40] They were just the same type that we called Banzai attacks. Our men were outstanding.
[00:02:47] As good as any I saw in World War II or Korea.
[00:02:52] End quote. Another taking part in the operation was PFC John Cosserato of Linhurst, New Jersey,
[00:03:01] who received his baptism of fire on those three days. Up to that combat action, his combat
[00:03:08] experience had been a short sweep during which his unit received a little sniper fire.
[00:03:17] I remember the firing was very heavy for a while and then it stopped. He said,
[00:03:23] I thought it was over. I'd heard that they hit you and ran, but it was far from over.
[00:03:29] We were too busy with the wounded to really think about what was happening. The biggest thing I
[00:03:34] remembered was the sun. It seemed like I couldn't get any place where it was cool enough to think straight.
[00:03:42] It was worse than I had imagined combat to be. There was a feeling of helplessness. The bullets were
[00:03:48] flying around us and we couldn't see who was shooting them. I really respect the medics.
[00:03:55] They were right out there in the middle of it. It was a good feeling to know that if you get wounded,
[00:04:00] those guys will come and help you. After it was all over, that night I realized what I went through.
[00:04:11] You wonder why you are alive when a lot of other people are gone.
[00:04:17] That's a newspaper article from 1966 from out there in Laughton, Oklahoma. It's talking about
[00:04:33] Operation Adelboro, which is mentioned a few times in the article. The operations named after
[00:04:38] Adelboro Massachusetts, where the 196th light infantry brigade had been reactivated out of four
[00:04:47] devins mass chusets. The 196th initiated this operation after they had only been in country for about two months.
[00:04:58] I would say this newspaper article paints the battle in a very positive picture, but it was a rough
[00:05:03] battle, very rough battle. The brigade commander was an inexperienced guy. He was an inexperienced
[00:05:12] infighting infantry. He didn't really prioritize next cue. Laugh some control at various points
[00:05:21] in the battle of what was happening. And in the end, even though as reported, there was over a
[00:05:28] thousand enemy kill, there was also some significant loss on the American side. 155 men killed and
[00:05:35] five missing from the first fourth and 25th infantry divisions. And the 196th. And I couldn't pin this
[00:05:45] down. I believe there was four medals of honor that were awarded for actions during this battle.
[00:05:50] And it was the largest series of air mobile operations at that time. And it was also a baptism of fire.
[00:06:03] As I mentioned, for the 196th light infantry out of out of four devins mass chusets. And
[00:06:11] as I was reading about this battle, I started thinking about that idea of light infantry. And
[00:06:16] just doing some reading, doing some research. And I came across a document that I thought was worth
[00:06:24] discussing. The document is called Proverbs of the Light Infantry, which out of the gate, you know,
[00:06:32] I'm kind of already thinking, this is going to be good to go. To written by a guy named Major Scott
[00:06:41] or Mick Michael, he's an army officer. And not only is he a military guy, obviously being in the army,
[00:06:48] being a major in the army, but he's also written a bunch historically speaking on light infantry,
[00:06:55] specifically wrote a book called a historical perspective on light infantry. He wrote another book
[00:07:02] called Stumbling Bear, Soviet military performance in Afghanistan. So he's got, you know,
[00:07:08] like I said, the military background. He's also got this historical background, which I think
[00:07:12] served him well and put in together this bunch of Proverbs, which were published in a magazine
[00:07:20] that I was lucky enough to find. So let's check out this document. Starts off history,
[00:07:28] provides many examples that could help define contemporary concepts. Here's an attempt to define
[00:07:34] the generic light infantry and suggest possible training tasks, Proverbs of the Light Infantry.
[00:07:42] By Major Scott or Mick Michael, US Army. So there's an article which I'll go through quickly.
[00:07:50] What exactly does Army mean by the term light infantry? What is the difference between light
[00:07:54] infantry and regular infantry? He is light infantry merely regular, regular infantry made light
[00:07:59] by stripping away a heavy equipment and vehicles or is it something quite different in terms of
[00:08:03] tactical style attitudes and utility? And this is what hit me is, look, when I, when I do these,
[00:08:10] when I, when I look at something, when I read something, if I'm thinking it's strict military
[00:08:16] information, then I'll save it for when I go and talk to military troops. However, much of the time,
[00:08:22] what you find is that military information, military knowledge, military proverbs in this place,
[00:08:30] are something that you can take and apply to absolutely anything in life. So when he's talking
[00:08:36] about light infantry, it sounds super specific. It's a lot more broad. These things can be applied,
[00:08:42] a lot more broadly. Back to the book, serving the official literature on the light division.
[00:08:49] One is hard put to avoid the conclusion that our Army leadership is taking the view that light
[00:08:54] infantry is nothing more than regular infantry made light for the purpose. For the overwriting
[00:08:59] purpose of strategic mobility, a number of facts support this conclusion. First, the initial design
[00:09:05] parameters for the division focused on restrictions, on size, not operational employment.
[00:09:12] The forced designers of the new light division labored under three basic parameters.
[00:09:17] One, a 10,000 man personnel ceiling, to a deployability limit of 500 or less,
[00:09:24] C141 sorties and three a requirement for the division to have nine battalion maneuver elements.
[00:09:31] So what he's saying there is, when they made this thing, what they base it off of is they
[00:09:36] wanted to be able to deploy this thing rapidly. You know, only 500 flights of C141, which is actually
[00:09:42] a lot of flies. But you know, you're going to get 10,000 people deployed in a short amount of time.
[00:09:48] Okay, so that's what they're looking to do. But he goes on a little bit. I'm going to skip ahead a
[00:09:53] little bit. There's more, there should be more to it. It shouldn't be just a little bit lighter.
[00:10:00] That shouldn't be the goal of light infantry. There should be some differences as well.
[00:10:04] He says certainly the army has not ignored the peculiar tactical characteristics of the division.
[00:10:09] It has, after all, developed light leaders course and undertaken a multitude of tests and
[00:10:14] studies to determine how to fight the division. But the hallmark of the division remains its
[00:10:19] strategic lightness, not its tactical lightness. This is an imbalance, not dismiss lightly.
[00:10:27] And he literally wrote and here, not upon. So the majors got some, got some comedic chops for
[00:10:33] I believe that it shows a lack of appreciation for the real meaning of light infantry. So he's
[00:10:39] arguing here that it's not just a regular infantry unit that has less equipment that
[00:10:50] have a different attitude and he gets to it here in contrast. And this is why I think this applies.
[00:10:56] Because we don't want to think that's so fascinating for instance about GJ2. Is it allow
[00:11:04] someone who's smaller and weaker to beat someone that's bigger and stronger? How can you do that
[00:11:10] tactics techniques, procedures, strategy, skills? Light infantry, well, light infantry can beat
[00:11:21] heavier infantry. How do they do that? The same thing that you use in GJ2. Businesses. Well,
[00:11:27] you're in a business, you've got to competitor that's bigger than you and stronger than you.
[00:11:31] And more capitalized than you are. How can you possibly beat them? That's where I'm going. That's
[00:11:36] what we want to know, right? That's why we love the GJ2. Right? So that's why we kind of,
[00:11:44] we kind of love the light infantry too. And we want to learn from the light infantry. Just like we
[00:11:48] learn from GJ2 when we apply it to business, we apply it to life. We can learn from the light infantry
[00:11:52] so that we can take advantage. So I'm sure you're going to go into it. But the light infantry
[00:11:57] essentially is it's for speed, right? Rapid deploy, rapid deploy ability. Yeah. But it's like where
[00:12:07] being the speed is more important or is a significant of significant importance in the situation.
[00:12:13] So, but with that speed comes certain drawbacks. So they have to apply certain techniques given
[00:12:18] those drawbacks. Exactly. How does Jeff Glover tap out echo Charles? Yeah. Can you do it? How does
[00:12:23] he tap out Joko? Can he do it because he's bigger and stronger? Can he do it because he's
[00:12:30] can apply more force than I can? No. He can out maneuver us. Yeah. He can out maneuver he can move.
[00:12:37] He can use his lightness and what else is he have flexibility. And then he has special
[00:12:42] little tactics, techniques and procedures that he can use. A little Jeff Glover, like a little monkey
[00:12:47] on your back. So here we get into it. In contrast to the general American use of the term
[00:12:56] light infantry as regular infantry may light, there exists another interpretation mostly European
[00:13:02] and context and origins, which is not tied to for structure or strategic mobility, nearly so
[00:13:08] originally as it is in the United States. This article sheds light on this opposing concept and
[00:13:14] sites a list of proverbs which characterizes operations by what could be referred to as classic
[00:13:21] light infantry. There are three primary characteristics of light infantry which distinguish it
[00:13:27] from regular infantry, one an attitude of self-reliance, two a propensity for improvisation and flexibility
[00:13:36] three a specific common tactical style. So those are the three things that he's saying are the
[00:13:44] true differentiators. The attitude of self-reliance is probably the most significant of the three
[00:13:50] attributes since the others are founded on it. Self-reliance is based on high levels of self-confidence,
[00:13:56] discipline, trust, unique cohesion and a never say die approach to problems.
[00:14:01] A presupposes the possession of highly developed individual skills not usually found in the regular
[00:14:10] infantry soldier. So discipline, trust, unique cohesion, the never say die approach to problems,
[00:14:21] which I like, but you know leadership and strategy and tactics in that book I talked about
[00:14:29] that's good attitude to have. I'm never going to quit but you also need to have the
[00:14:36] detachment to take a look at a problem where you're throwing all your resources and not winning
[00:14:39] and say you know what I'm going to throw my resources at this problem in a different way.
[00:14:44] We don't want to lose the ability to think. We don't want never say die to translate to never think
[00:14:50] of another solution to a problem that we're facing. Light infantry, know that no matter what
[00:14:57] the situation they can make due by turning the situation to their advantage. Love that.
[00:15:04] Oh, there's bad weather. Cool. Watch us. We're going to use that to our advantage.
[00:15:09] Oh, there's tough terrain. Great. We're going to use that to our advantage.
[00:15:15] Classic light infantry almost distains logistics. A believing that is it is possible to live in
[00:15:22] on and off the land and to use the enemy's supplies and weapons if necessary. Self-reliance,
[00:15:28] transens, unfavorable circumstances and finds a way to accomplish the mission through innovation,
[00:15:35] imagination and perseverance. Distains logistics. We don't even want support. We don't even want a
[00:15:45] supply chain. We're going to live off the land.
[00:15:48] Well, light infantry's attitude of self-reliance leads directly to a propensity for flexibility
[00:15:54] and improvisation. The light infantry cannot afford a rigid approach to tactical problems.
[00:16:00] So I love that because now we're going back on the fact that we have a never say die attitude.
[00:16:06] Guess what? We also can't afford a rigid approach to tactical problems. So we got a good
[00:16:12] dichotomy that's getting balanced out now. We were a little nervous at first.
[00:16:15] Instead, light infantry seeks to respond quickly to change, turning its strengths against the
[00:16:21] enemies' weaknesses in ways that the enemy does not expect. Yes, due to it's it.
[00:16:27] The light infantry leader improvises to accomplish his mission by changing his tactics and
[00:16:32] organization whenever necessary. So that's very different from traditional military thought.
[00:16:41] Right? Well, we got a different problem. Just change our organization, change our tactics. What do we
[00:16:44] got to do? Old equipment is used in new ways and new methods are developed to meet a changing
[00:16:51] situation. Light infantry is a light of foot, so to speak, and light and quick of mind as well.
[00:16:59] I wouldn't even see as well. I'd say that's probably the predominant
[00:17:03] trait that we want. Light of mind, quick of mind.
[00:17:08] Amazing how people get entrenched in their own little ideas or their own big ideas.
[00:17:15] Yes, sir. Entrenched. Can't move. The light infantry uses improvisation and flexibility as a combat
[00:17:23] multiplier thereby frequently achieving a psychological advantage over an enemy which may outman
[00:17:30] and outgun it. Oh, so I'm going to someone the other day. I'm hearing him, he's trying,
[00:17:43] he's asking me to help him come up with a strategic plan. A, B, C, D, E, F. And he's getting some resistance.
[00:17:54] He's got different parts of the team, pulling them in different directions. And he's having a hard
[00:18:01] time making a decision of like, well, we could do this, but then if this tap, we could do that,
[00:18:06] but then I'm worried about this. So it's a problem. And what I'm sitting there listening to them
[00:18:14] and I'm thinking, and I have to play this mental game with myself because the way that you
[00:18:21] don't find an answer when you're talking to someone is to try so hard to understand what their
[00:18:29] perspective is that you become wrapped up in the problem yourself. So I was kind of doing that.
[00:18:34] I'm thinking, well, he says, well, you know, this group is saying that we should do this and
[00:18:38] this other group is saying that we should do that. And I'm starting to weigh those two groups out and
[00:18:41] see what's once, you know, you know, I'm saying so I'm starting I'm getting too close to it.
[00:18:46] So I'm listening. So what I have to do is I have to actually play this little game with
[00:18:50] myself where I say, okay, what would I actually really do if I was in the situation?
[00:18:58] And I said, hey, neither one of these groups know what's going to happen and neither do you.
[00:19:06] And you right now are trying to make a rigid plan about a future that is unknown to you. Let's
[00:19:13] reassess the plan and come up with one that revolves around flexibility and adaptability,
[00:19:21] not about not around rigidity. Problem solved. And that's really all that took.
[00:19:30] That's really all that took. How can we come up with a more flexible plan?
[00:19:35] We don't know, do you know what's going to happen tomorrow?
[00:19:38] Okay, so we can come up with a plan, but we want a flexible plan because it you can plan to go to the beach,
[00:19:42] but we don't know what the weather's going to be. Yes, kind of like the overpacking thing we talked about
[00:19:46] a long time ago where a refresh my memory. You know, like that's why you wind up overpacking because you're
[00:19:52] like, what if we do that? What if we do this? What if we do this? What if we go swimming? What if we go
[00:19:57] whatever and it's like, you don't know if you're even going to go, you don't even have a plan to go to dinner.
[00:20:01] Even though you kind of know you go to dinner sometimes, you know, and then you do that too much.
[00:20:05] Right, you're over here over packing. Yeah, I'll let you're Levison, Levison.
[00:20:09] Yeah, Levison, but that's the long term. He's had the Iran.
[00:20:12] That's some light infantry traveling there. Yes, and he's got a backpack and $8. He might be
[00:20:18] straight up over light infantry traveling. I was thinking about I was thinking about him
[00:20:24] from this perspective, you know, you do so much contingency planning, right? In the military.
[00:20:29] What if this happens? What if that happens? He must have been looking at contingency plans. Like,
[00:20:33] Oh, no worry, it'll be good. Hopefully not. And that's the key to that's one of the keys to
[00:20:38] light infantry. Yeah, flexible planning. Yeah, especially with that approach, you know, so you
[00:20:44] you go to, in our case, we'll go to Koi. You need a certain amount of things that you need. You're
[00:20:50] going to need like seven. Yeah, like shorts. You just surf shorts. In fact, you get the hybrid shorts.
[00:20:55] A surf shorts plus casual. Okay. Same thing. We have some of them. Yeah, you know, a shirt,
[00:21:02] you know, a few shirts or whatever. Make sure you have a lot of your machine over there.
[00:21:06] Two brush. Two brush. Two paste. If you can kind of get toothpaste there and really a
[00:21:11] tooth brush. Yeah. And that's a big part too, where, you know, kind of like leaving off the land.
[00:21:15] And the sounds dumb. I know, but it's the same thing. It's the same thing. So you're really
[00:21:19] good at like LA. You just count going on a long, it's an off the land. It is the travel version
[00:21:25] of leaving off the land. When you go to a civilized place, what I'm saying is the stretch. Yeah,
[00:21:28] you don't when you go to like LA or something. And you're like, should I be there for two days?
[00:21:32] Um, you know, two, two and a half hour drive or whatever. It's like like a better bring enough to face or a better
[00:21:38] right, you can stop it any store in LA and get it. Just leave off the land. Don't look at that stuff.
[00:21:42] Let me can live off the land. It's the same thing. That being actually a good reality television.
[00:21:47] Echo living off the land. Good. It's for installing rolling into a Ralph's in LA. I can make this work.
[00:21:57] It's the same thing. It's exactly the same thing. The travel version.
[00:22:01] Exactly. Never mind. Honten building a bow, hunting down and killing an animal and scanning it. Never
[00:22:07] mind that. No, no, let's two advanced. We're rolling into vans.
[00:22:14] Check. All right. So we're saying flexible. Yeah. We are prepared to live off the land if needed.
[00:22:20] If there's a washer right there. Well, you're going to bring that much clothes. You seem
[00:22:24] to be the same. My first deployment. I went to Guam. Yeah. And I thought I was going to know them.
[00:22:31] Right. So I wasn't. I didn't plan for like a bunch of civilian stuff to be happening. I didn't plan to be
[00:22:38] you know down at the beach all day. Most days, which is what we actually did on my first deployment.
[00:22:47] And I think I had maybe two pairs of shorts and I just wore them the entire time. I would wear
[00:22:53] one for like a week because you're just in the ocean. You're, you know, you're taking a fresh water shower.
[00:22:59] And you're just totally good to go. Yeah. Even off the land as they say. Yeah, man. That's a,
[00:23:04] and that's how quiet. Like you're wearing your shorts. So you're going to the beach in
[00:23:10] pretty much the whole time. Pretty much. Yeah. So yeah, you bring two of those. You're pretty good.
[00:23:14] Pretty shallow back up. You got back up. Yeah. That's true. Check. See, I knew there was light
[00:23:21] infantry application, even the echoed trails exist. It's where they're. Yeah. We're there. All right.
[00:23:26] Back to the book. Not surprisingly self-aliance improvisation and flexibility,
[00:23:32] pre-set unique tactical style as the key features of which are surprised, stealth, shock,
[00:23:39] and offensiveness. The light infantry always seek to retain the initiative to keep the
[00:23:44] enemy off balance. That was, uh, here's a good quote from Dean Listch, because I was training with
[00:23:50] him the other day and what he was teaching class. He said, okay. So the guy on the bottom,
[00:23:57] across side, what advantage is does he have? Were you here for this cross?
[00:24:03] No, but given what you're saying right now, he said that. Yeah. So he, you know, and everyone kind of
[00:24:09] throws, actually there's not a lot of guesses, because let's face it. When you're on the bottom
[00:24:13] when someone's across side on you, you're not feeling a bunch of advantages. So he looked at it
[00:24:19] with a positive attitude. And he said, no one, you're on the bottom and some of the cross sign
[00:24:24] on you, you can't fall down. Yeah. That's a good attitude. Yes. That's a good attitude. I thought of
[00:24:30] another one and say it to him. I'll have to discuss it with him. It's the, the person is going to
[00:24:36] have to give space to submit you in most cases from a cross side. There's going to be an
[00:24:42] opportunity when if people try and submit you. If you'll just hold you, you're, you're going to
[00:24:46] get held. Yeah. But if they make movement to advance position or to submit you, they're,
[00:24:53] the advantage that you have is there's going to be some space. Yeah. Like, I think there's even less space
[00:25:02] if, if, if I'm in Dean Lister's closed guard, I feel like I can move less even when he's going
[00:25:09] for something than if he's across side. That's kind of how I feel might be particular to my
[00:25:13] style or whatever, but can't fall down when you're already on the ground. That's a big advantage. I guess.
[00:25:23] Off balance. The way that a good GJ2 player would attack your balance, that is just,
[00:25:30] that that's the same thing we have to think about on the battlefield. How can we keep the
[00:25:35] enemy off balance in the business world? If the, if the competitors know exactly what we're
[00:25:40] going to do, they just plan for it. They make a plan. And the more they think they know what you're
[00:25:44] going to do, the less flexible their plan is. So we need to do something that throws them off balance.
[00:25:50] Going to be good for you. Light infantry operates most frequently at night and uses terrain
[00:25:56] at hand to full advantage. Light infantry is terrain oriented and is able to switch operations
[00:26:03] from one type of terrain to another without paralysis of the mind. Parallysis of the mind.
[00:26:16] How often you see that? It's very, it's actually a specific thing. A switch in terrain,
[00:26:22] a switch in environment, and people walk up. I see it. Yeah, I can see that.
[00:26:28] Especially, and this goes back to something the army said, especially when it's a surprise.
[00:26:34] If I surprise you with something, that's when brain freeze happens. If you're going to see a
[00:26:40] common, you're preparing for it. So it's almost like surprise has to be utilized to cause people to freeze
[00:26:46] up. Yeah, in my opinion. Moreover, in combat, the light infantry is logistics conscious, but not
[00:26:55] logistics dependent. Light infantry relies on superior tactics, not superior firepower to win the battle.
[00:27:03] That's your answer. The short discussion. This short discussion barely scratches the surface of
[00:27:10] the issue. It does, however, capture the essence of classic light infantry, the Proverbs, which are
[00:27:16] listed here, going to more detail. And hopefully clarify the picture somewhat further. They have been
[00:27:22] gleamed from the close study of several excellent light infantry forces in the recent past.
[00:27:28] Although many of these Proverbs apply equally well to regular infantry, as a group, they do a fair
[00:27:34] job of embodying the nature of classic light infantry as distinct from regular infantry in conclusion.
[00:27:41] Even though many of these Proverbs should be embraced by all infantry, not just light infantry,
[00:27:47] history is demonstrated the difficulty of including the difficulty of inculcating the light
[00:27:55] infantry virtue or style, except in small segments, usually elite elements of national armies.
[00:28:01] So what do you say in there is? These are great. And they'll work for regular infantry.
[00:28:10] But these are a little bit harder to grow inside of an organization. So chances are, even though
[00:28:22] they're good, idea to try. Chants are, you're not going to be as effective making this happen.
[00:28:26] Now, I can tell you that I think this thing was written decently, I don't know, 40 years ago,
[00:28:32] something like that. I think times have changed. I think you'd find going out and me actually
[00:28:39] working with light infantry units. Man, they're good. So, sorry, with regular infantry units as well.
[00:28:46] And armored infantry units as well. I've worked with all of them and they're all freaking good to go.
[00:28:51] That's what you get good when you've been at war as a nation for a couple decades.
[00:28:59] The US Army, particularly has a history of being tied to its logistics chain and has relied
[00:29:03] more on firepower than on military art for its victories. So I'm truth to that. Let us assume that the
[00:29:09] new light infantry divisions should be trained in the classic light infantry style. The army may find
[00:29:14] it difficult to do so. Since it is a style with which we are basically unfamiliar except for our
[00:29:20] specialty forces, particularly the Ranger Battalions. The first step, however, is for the army to
[00:29:26] decide what it means by light infantry. Is it merely light infantry made light by the absence of
[00:29:31] heavy equipment or is it something more like what has been described here? This is a question
[00:29:37] which would be answered quickly for it has significant bearing on the training, strategy, and leadership
[00:29:42] of our new light divisions. So that's kind of his intro. I think it's a good solid intro.
[00:29:48] I think it gives us an idea. And it also, again, the reason I think this is so
[00:29:52] and so usable is because we're talking about a smaller, weaker force going up against a bigger,
[00:30:03] stronger force. This is maneuver warfare. This is indirect attacks. That's what this is. That's
[00:30:09] why it applies. Yeah, I feel like this applies to more people, especially when you're in a
[00:30:15] sort of playing it to other than something other than military stuff, where because it's so
[00:30:20] feels like in any way that's so often we find ourselves in a situation where it's like,
[00:30:25] I don't have the experience, I don't have the resources, I don't have the, you know,
[00:30:30] I'm not as big as that guy or whatever, and we feel like we kind of don't have a chance,
[00:30:35] you know, because they're just so far ahead of us in that way. So it's like, oh, no one has a chance,
[00:30:41] you know, they're like, I'm an apoli and whatever way, you know. But it's not the case, you know?
[00:30:46] It's true. And you know, it's interesting from a business perspective. So I work with all different
[00:30:51] industries, right? But one day I'll be talking to a client who is the small startup, you know,
[00:30:59] 400 employees on the growth pattern, they're making things happen, but they still can't.
[00:31:05] They still have some disadvantages against the big boys, right? And so I'll be talking to them about,
[00:31:10] okay, here's what we need to do. You need to work as, you know, you work on your mobility,
[00:31:14] how can we mend out maneuver the enemy like all those things? The next day or even the next hour,
[00:31:19] I'll be talking to one of the big companies that has all these little elements out there,
[00:31:25] these small startups that are trying to snatch business share, what are we going to do to
[00:31:29] immobilize those small. So I actually end up teaching both insurgency and counter insurgency,
[00:31:37] depending on the client. And what's good is that I, since I, since I, I'm familiar with how each
[00:31:47] one of those components needs to win. So I can help them counter what's going on. So it boils
[00:31:56] down to execution too. The boils down to execution, can you actually do what I'm talking about?
[00:32:03] Yeah, because if you can't come up with a flexible plan or you can come up with a flexible plan,
[00:32:08] but you don't have the leadership to actually make it happen, you're, did you're not going to make it happen?
[00:32:14] Yeah, that's so true. So even like, they like, he talked about the mindset early on,
[00:32:19] the mindset that we're looking to change direction. We're looking to be creative, like, it's
[00:32:24] quick, you know, quick, unlike, you know, let's face it, the bigger a, I don't know, I'm thinking
[00:32:29] of a company, by the way. But if like the bigger the company is the more it seems like, hey,
[00:32:34] you better have your protocols in place that we all follow. Otherwise, the thinking, you know,
[00:32:38] an organized, so it's like, they had kind of no choice, but to be a little bit more rigid in that way.
[00:32:43] Rigid bureaucratic, very stable, very difficult to change. So what does that mean? That means
[00:32:52] when you're a small company, you're like, oh, you client needs this. Guess what? We can do that
[00:32:55] for you. Contraderant Uncle's shift how we do things for you. Yeah. The big companies, we don't
[00:33:00] actually do that. Yeah, let me put you on hold. You can, you can, you can, you will, you will give
[00:33:04] you the system that we use and you can use the system we use. The small clients like, well,
[00:33:08] adapt our system. No factor. Let's do it. Shoot it. Don't get them on customer service. But
[00:33:13] you go to a big company customer service. They're going to be outsourcing the reading scripts,
[00:33:17] like all this stuff, because they kind of got in a, in a big way where it's like, hey,
[00:33:21] we need everyone to give the same quote unquote quality customer service. Like, we need, you know,
[00:33:26] you got to know all this stuff about our big, longstanding company. You know, to help these people.
[00:33:30] So you better be educated. Right. So good example. Big company, maybe they, they know that they're
[00:33:38] going to lose out on customer service, because the small company can can adapt quicker and make
[00:33:44] adjustments. That means the big company needs to invest more in that area. And maybe they need
[00:33:48] to hire some experts, and maybe they need to dump some money into, you know, computer,
[00:33:56] help where I can actually log into your computer and I can help if we're talking about it's
[00:33:59] software. Right. I can, well, you know, no problem. Mr. Charles, let's say what, if you type in this
[00:34:02] code word, I'll get into your computer right now and I can get that fixed for you, right? You want to
[00:34:06] put money. So you know where your weaknesses are. You identify your weaknesses and then you
[00:34:12] fix them. And if you're the small guy, you know where the enemies weaknesses are. The big
[00:34:18] guys weaknesses are and you exploit those. You start making fun of them. Start capitalizing on them.
[00:34:26] Which you got to be careful, because if I start if you're the big guy and I start making fun of
[00:34:29] your customer service, you could, you're, you're, you're, you're, you'll dump a bunch of money in
[00:34:32] customer service also and you start beat me there. So I got to be careful. I don't want to provoke
[00:34:36] the big guy. Yeah. Maybe I just want to stay under the radar and and keep taking customers from you
[00:34:43] and you don't really know why. It's because I respond to every single customer service issue,
[00:34:49] you know, with a team that's going to talk directly within three minutes. That's a very, uh,
[00:34:56] that's very significant concept staying under the radio radar. I think it's underrated to
[00:35:03] because the even just as a human being it feels like you want the attention, you want the credit,
[00:35:08] you want the recognition for this, you want to win the award, you want them and know you won or,
[00:35:15] you know, even more scary or counterproductive is you want the enemy to know that you just did this.
[00:35:22] Yeah. And that's more counterproductive because now you're giving away what your position is.
[00:35:26] Yeah. You're giving away what you're doing to achieve victory and part of that goes deep because
[00:35:31] even even if you're not like, because no, you know, like, okay, if you want the enemy to know,
[00:35:37] right, that's like some like, hey, this may get into you. I got something against you personally.
[00:35:41] So boom, yeah, I got you what kind of a thing, right? It's like a challenge almost kind of thing,
[00:35:45] but even if like just everyday stuff, you know, some people, for example, they'll make
[00:35:49] they'll start making a lot of money or something and then they'll buy jewelry or something like that.
[00:35:53] Or something flashy, you know, or, you know, they maybe they have some online following or something
[00:36:00] and then they want to show their nice cars and their nice cows and they want to do all this stuff, right?
[00:36:04] Just to like show how it's like a need, I guess, you know, for recognition or whatever.
[00:36:08] But now what you'll what you did is you provoke the giant now. You made everyone know about their
[00:36:14] stuff. Now this giant, whatever that may be, I don't know how that translates, but it is something
[00:36:18] where the people trying to take advantage of that, people asking you for stuff, you know, people
[00:36:23] trying to use your XYZ that you just showed them that you have, by the way.
[00:36:27] Volunteerly, because you needed somewhere, now they're going to try to find a way to use that
[00:36:32] for their advantage and then it's like everybody too.
[00:36:35] Essentially, that's the giant. There's your giant right there.
[00:36:38] You're going to watch out for that. You've got to watch out for your ego getting you to do things
[00:36:42] that are stupid. Yeah. Straight up. Probing the giant or whatever.
[00:36:47] Like even in Iraq, in Ramadi, we didn't want, we tried to, we didn't want the enemy to know what was
[00:36:56] happening. Like why are people getting shot? What's happening? You know, we don't like, oh yeah,
[00:37:02] we're snipers, we got teams in, no, just all of a sudden they start losing guys. A lot of them.
[00:37:10] They don't know why. It's now it's fear. And then obviously they figured out pretty quick.
[00:37:17] Check. All right. So now we get into the, to the, to the proverves themselves, the
[00:37:23] proverves of the light of victory. Here we go. Lighting for lighting for the operations. There
[00:37:28] exists a light infantry attitude, which can be described in a few characteristic words,
[00:37:32] offensiveness, initiative, surprise, improvisation and total self-reliance.
[00:37:40] There's a part where we could just end the podcast right now, right? Because if you take those
[00:37:44] were those concepts to the end degree, you, you know what we're talking about.
[00:37:49] But you won't get the full impact. Light forces are undaunted by terrain. terrain is viewed
[00:37:57] as an ally. A combat multiplier for the light infantrymen, light forces are terrain oriented.
[00:38:04] Very little terrain is impossible to true light infantrymen. Now what I, this to me,
[00:38:10] one thing that I was taught as a young frogman, bathroom, talking to. When there's bad weather
[00:38:18] or there's bad terrain, that means that the enemy has to contend with it and they're not going to.
[00:38:25] And we are. And so terrain, oh, there's horrible steep crazy hills. Cool. Yeah, that means the
[00:38:32] enemy is not going to be on patrol up there. We will be undaunted. Light infantry does its best when
[00:38:39] it lives on in and off the land. It must be comfortable in the bush or in rouse. If you're
[00:38:48] going to put your arms in that life for two days. How much of that? Okay, so let's take
[00:38:57] you, Jitsu. How much of it is Jitsu good because let's face it. If you play out like zombie
[00:39:05] apocalypse in your head, you kind of think, hey, when it comes down to it, if I can beat people
[00:39:11] and fights. Look, because we ran out of bullets, you know what I'm saying? Like you get to a point
[00:39:17] where I'm going to come down to me against you. Yeah. So there's a little bit of that being able
[00:39:24] to survive that you get from Jitsu. Yeah, actually that's a real rock, kind of form of it, you know,
[00:39:33] where I think we actually talked about this. I think it was just me we were just talking.
[00:39:39] Where you can have like a big group of people and then they can then you and the group can be heavily
[00:39:45] armed and then and then have a bunch of knives and then have body armor or whatever, whatever,
[00:39:51] right? Just all the tools and all the whatever. There's like you can lose your weapons. You can
[00:39:57] lose your knives. You can lose your body armor or you forget it or I don't know whatever. But
[00:40:03] at some point it's very possible that it's going to be just like you said, it's me against you.
[00:40:10] No knives, no weapons, no whatever. Yeah, could be that way in about an hour and a half. Okay,
[00:40:15] I understand. And then it's like then where are you? Is it night and day? You know,
[00:40:21] are you just businesses, usual kind of kind of thing? Like, you know, I'm sorry. It could
[00:40:26] make me go back to video games. But you know how like you go? Is it game called Zanik? Actually,
[00:40:30] I feel like I'm brought this up before where if you get like this weapon, is this the super
[00:40:35] spreader? No, yeah, that one too. Yeah, on contra when you get the spreader, you're like
[00:40:39] bone-bomb and you can win. Oh, it's called the spreader. I call it the super spreader because this
[00:40:42] is grown up. Yeah. But once you die and lose that weapon and you go back to just what your
[00:40:50] issued in the video game, which is what we call the P shooter, you got to be good with that thing.
[00:40:56] And if you're not, you're just going to game over. That's a be comfortable in the bush.
[00:41:01] Yeah. It's true. Good intelligence is vital to light infantry, intelligence obtained by the
[00:41:07] light infantry from every source from the national level to the use of local inhabitants,
[00:41:14] reconnaissance and petroleum. Yeah, gathering information. Absolutely. Conventional tactics are
[00:41:18] no good for light forces. You know, I we'd have to dig down and see what you're actually talking
[00:41:24] about when you're talking about conventional tactics. I'm not going to, I'm not going to bless
[00:41:28] that one on the spot. I get it. Right. You can't plan sometimes, for instance, conventional
[00:41:36] forces will plan for a certain number of casualties for a certain operation. Like you're just
[00:41:41] going to take these casualties. You get into light infantry smaller units. That can be a real
[00:41:45] problem. You can't just accept casualties. For example, historically light infantry operations
[00:41:54] are mounted at battalion level and lower light infantry operations are highly dependent on squad
[00:41:58] platoon and company level actions. Got it. Light forces need high quality communications to coordinate
[00:42:07] decentralized efforts into a coherent whole. Okay. So this article is written 40, 50 years ago.
[00:42:14] Something like that. And it's just interesting to me. Communications of all kinds are unreliable.
[00:42:23] Radios, they're all unreliable in a combat zone. And if you don't have coordination measures
[00:42:32] in effect that don't rely on radio communications, you can count on there to be problems.
[00:42:38] And I'll tell you, even as our, as our, as our communication capabilities get better,
[00:42:46] when you start talking about fighting against near peer adversaries, meaning big giant
[00:42:52] countries like ours that have big giant technological equipment like we have. You can't,
[00:43:00] you get to a point where you can't use radios because they have something called defin capability.
[00:43:04] If you've heard of that direction finding capability. So if you key up your radio, they know
[00:43:11] your yard. Your radio gives off radio waves. And there are ways that radio, those radio waves
[00:43:18] can be detected and they can pinpoint your location. So you have to be able to operate with
[00:43:26] minimal, minimal communications. So I don't like this, this particular one says light forces need
[00:43:35] high quality communications to coordinate decentralized efforts into a coherent whole. Actually,
[00:43:40] I don't, I don't like that. When I tell you this is what we're doing, this is why we're doing it.
[00:43:44] I give you the commanders intent. I want you to be able to go and I don't need to talk to you again.
[00:43:49] And by the way, you'll see whatever other unit needed to do something coordinate with you,
[00:43:54] you're going to know what's happening. By what's happening? You're going to see an explosion.
[00:43:57] You're like, oh, life's still tuned. Just started their breads. That means I can go. Like,
[00:44:00] you're, you're seeing them saying, you need to be able to coordinate things. You can't be reliant
[00:44:05] on radios. You can't. There was probably a year, there's probably a five, five-year time period,
[00:44:14] where you where the radios were good and the enemy direction-finding capability wasn't quite
[00:44:20] there yet. But that period's over. Do to a general shortage of combat support light forces must
[00:44:30] do an excellent job of combining arms when they have a chance. Yes, absolutely. You got to be
[00:44:34] able to work with the other units that can support you. You got to be able to do a light infantry
[00:44:38] forces must be masters of improvisation, familiar with all kinds of weapons, vehicles, landing craft,
[00:44:43] and so forth. Yes, light infantry forces make use of whatever is at hand to improve their combat
[00:44:50] capability. Absolutely. Native, irregular forces are often used in support of light infantry.
[00:45:00] Yes, what does that mean? That means you have to go build relationships with the local populist. That's
[00:45:04] what that means. In order to do that, you got to know that that's what you need to do. Because
[00:45:11] 18-year-old kids with machine guns are focused on building relationships. They're not. They go
[00:45:17] into a country. They have a machine gun. They have grenades and if what they think they're
[00:45:22] going to do is hawk grenades and shoot machine guns. So you need to educate them and make sure that they
[00:45:30] understand how the local populist is going to play a role in giving you support.
[00:45:41] Light infantry must remain flexible in mind and action capable of reacting quickly.
[00:45:47] Already talked about flexible, plants, flexible, mind. When a light infantryman rises from his
[00:45:56] sleep, he's ready to fight. I like that. Light infantryman rely on camouflage. Why is that?
[00:46:04] Because we don't want to give away our position. We don't want to advertise what we're doing.
[00:46:10] We don't want to advertise how we're beating the competition. We want to have camouflage.
[00:46:18] Against heavy enemy forces, the light infantry always requires a great deal of augmentation. Cool.
[00:46:25] You've got to face the reality that you may not have the resources that are needed to defeat
[00:46:34] bigger stronger enemy. You have to be able to say that. So if you're, that's why there's a lot of
[00:46:40] industries right now where you can get help inside your small business. You can get IT support.
[00:46:47] You can get personnel support. You can get engineering support. You need all this kind of support.
[00:46:52] And you've got to recognize when you need to utilize some of that other support.
[00:46:58] You might not necessarily want to build it out. Had this conversation,
[00:47:01] life was just telling me this, when we were starting EF online.
[00:47:06] And we started talking about building this and building that. And I said, hey,
[00:47:12] we don't want to become a software company. And he was like, check.
[00:47:17] Because it's better to hire someone that does that. That's what they do. I don't want to
[00:47:22] have a bunch of software engineers and programmers and IT. So I don't want to, I don't want to have all that.
[00:47:29] That's a different business. We don't want to be an eye, we don't want to be a software company.
[00:47:34] We want to be a leadership training company. Cool. And he was, he was like, got it.
[00:47:38] Because we had started because it's one of those mission creep things, right? We were like,
[00:47:42] you're like, if we just add this, we'd spilled that and all of a sudden, you got a proprietary
[00:47:47] system that you got to maintain and hire more people. We're not looking to do that. We why?
[00:47:52] We think light infantry. And what you need to do is use augmentation if needed.
[00:48:01] Light infantry men must be able to climb crawl, swim, ski, snow shoe,
[00:48:07] repel, stock, run and hide. Obviously, echo this is written before snowboarding. Yes,
[00:48:14] because I know you're over there thinking, those of you that don't know, echo's now a snowboarder.
[00:48:21] Isn't it interesting to actually talk about the fact that you got to have all these different
[00:48:26] ways of getting around by using your own energy? Light infantry must be able, marksman,
[00:48:33] proficient in the use and maintenance of many weapons, light forces rely on pioneer skills at
[00:48:38] all level, beginning with the squad to properly exploit terrain, pioneer skills. Does that mean you
[00:48:46] have a Ralph's card? Nobody knows where everything is. I don't say. As you get lost these foreign
[00:48:53] stores, you know, can be hostile. Do you remember driving around? Yeah, you do. Remember no GPS is just so
[00:49:01] to give it. It's given now. Yeah, to give it. How did you get around before GPS to your
[00:49:05] member off-top yet? Like you're in a new spot or you're going to a new spot kind of far away.
[00:49:10] You brought a map? No, you get a map. Yeah. Well, I guess if I was going somewhere where there wasn't
[00:49:16] going to be a way to live off the land and go to this convenience store and buy a map. Sure,
[00:49:20] but I was taking my daughter to Coronado, like a little while ago. And so Coronado is where I
[00:49:29] worked for 20 whatever years. And what I live now a few miles from Coronado. And we get in the car
[00:49:39] and I start pulling out my daughter's like doing and putting the GPS. Yeah.
[00:49:43] I'm like, are you serious? Are you serious right now? And she says, yeah, why?
[00:49:49] I don't go. It's Coronado. I worked there for 20 freaking years. Yeah. And she's like, well, I didn't,
[00:49:54] I don't know. Yeah. But that's, but that's her mentality is when you get in a car, you're going somewhere.
[00:50:01] You GPS? Uh, yeah. Because she's just a young man. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy.
[00:50:06] Uh, well, because I had the exact same incident. Wasn't Coronado was downtown. And I
[00:50:10] worked downtown for a number of years and go down there, whatever. So I don't downtown.
[00:50:14] Brian, oh, downtown, like back on my hand. Yeah. And we're going in the same thing.
[00:50:19] She puts it in Sarah. Sir. Yeah, puts it in the or is like, she puts it in her GPS and her phone
[00:50:24] and starts rattling off the directions as if I don't know, you know, this man, man of the world doesn't
[00:50:31] know, um, you know, how to get to the place we're going to downtown my hood, whatever. Um, so yeah,
[00:50:38] I don't need that GPS, but the thing is, Sarah's not as young as you're not. Obviously, but it
[00:50:43] does start to become like a habit, you know, I mean, just so happened, I knew my way around. I think
[00:50:49] if I didn't know my way around, see, I same thing automatic itself. Like I don't even think twice
[00:50:53] about it. Like in back in the day, I used to go, um, you know, to places or whatever. And I remember going
[00:51:00] in the either the white pages of the yellow pages or whatever they'd have the map in the front of it.
[00:51:05] And then I'd write down directions. That's it. I lost before two, a couple times, but it's not
[00:51:12] not quite as effective as the. Yeah. I wonder what's how much that skill is just being lost now.
[00:51:17] I'm sure it feels like it's gone straight up gone. You can find one or two guys and we could be
[00:51:22] real negative about that. Oh, we could also be well, what skills have people now garnered because
[00:51:28] they don't have to worry about that skill anymore. Yeah. Not sure. The next one, the pertinent
[00:51:34] range or standards of land navigation are a must for light forces. Got nowhere you're going. Got
[00:51:41] nowhere you are. Yeah. Light infantry rarely uses roads or trails. What does that mean? How's that
[00:51:47] apply? I'll tell you to apply. You find new ways of doing things. And just because there's a beaten
[00:51:53] path doesn't mean you should necessarily take it. Doesn't mean you can't take it. But you should
[00:51:58] think, is there a better way to get this done? Light infantry forces, left in combat theaters for
[00:52:04] long, inevitably become heavier due to the acquisition of heavier weapons plus increased logistics
[00:52:09] structure. What does that mean? Keep moving. Keep moving. The minute you settle down,
[00:52:15] now you're going to start to grow in ways that aren't necessarily beneficial.
[00:52:23] Light infantry appreciates heavy fire support when it is available, but it's not dependent on it.
[00:52:29] Physical conditioning and mental strength are absolute musts across the board.
[00:52:38] Light forces, this goes into the next section, which is called the offense.
[00:52:43] Light forces may be deployed at the operational level of war, but they always fight at the
[00:52:48] tactical level. Light forces think at the tactical level. And okay there's another one I'm like,
[00:52:56] I got a press pause on that one. I'm not blessing fully. Okay, except for
[00:53:02] Cavia, I guess Cavia. Light forces think at the tactical level, but you better
[00:53:07] understand the strategic goal. You have to understand why you're doing what you're doing.
[00:53:13] Otherwise, you can't think at the tactical level. Because if I say, all right, Echo, we want to
[00:53:19] take out that building. And you say, cool, we got it. And you get in there and there's a little
[00:53:23] bit of resistance. So you, you know, blow it up. And then I say, actually strategically, we're trying
[00:53:29] to keep the infrastructure in place here. And you're like, oh, I might have wanted that. Let me know that.
[00:53:32] So thinking tactical is cool, it better be nested inside the strategic goals.
[00:53:41] Does your team? Where's your team at, by the way? And your business, in your company,
[00:53:48] in your family, where's their head at? Do they understand the tactical goals that you're going
[00:53:53] for? Do they understand, are those tactical goals nested inside what we're trying to do strategically?
[00:53:58] Good question. Two light infantry loves the night. Light forces fight at night and hide during the
[00:54:07] day. What, what, how does it? How does that apply? I'll tell you how you need to understand where
[00:54:16] you're at at an advantage. That's what that's saying. Look, night, day, whatever. We're not,
[00:54:22] we're not transferring this. You know, you're not going to be, hey, our, you know, our construction
[00:54:27] company is going to do better at night. That's not what we're saying. What you say is, hey,
[00:54:31] there's an area of construction that we're good at. We're really good at high end custom homes
[00:54:38] or we're really good at multiple massive track homes that we just repeat the same. You're going
[00:54:43] to be fine. What you're good at? And you're going to exploit that. You're going to start focusing
[00:54:49] on that area. You're going to hide from the areas we're going to get beat. Light infantry attacks
[00:54:54] violently and suddenly on two or more axes, seeking, flanks and rear of the enemy. Right, we're
[00:55:04] not going toe to toe. We're not, this is an apugelistic endeavor where we stand here and punch each
[00:55:10] other. We maneuver. We get the flanks. This is, you can see you how all this stuff just fits right
[00:55:18] into my brain. This is fits right into my brain. Attacks are conducted fiercely and tenaciously
[00:55:26] against enemy weaknesses, not strength, not the enemy strengths. That's maneuver warfare.
[00:55:31] maneuver warfare. We maneuver to wear the enemy as week. That's jujitsu. We put my deadlift power,
[00:55:41] which is my hips and my back against echoes curling power, which is an arm lock. And despite
[00:55:48] your relatively powerful curling capabilities, done compared to my deadlift and the arm lock will win.
[00:56:02] Light forces attack stripped for action. So when you're in the field, you can be end up
[00:56:10] carrying a lot of equipment. When you go on the attack, they're saying here, don't carry that
[00:56:15] equipment with you into the attack. What this is, what this is is prioritize and execute. Look,
[00:56:22] we carried all this weight in. Now we need to focus on the biggest problem we've got, which is
[00:56:26] doing this assault. Take off your gear, leave your water behind, not all that leave a bulk of your
[00:56:32] water behind. Leave your cold weather gear. Leave that stuff behind. We're going on an assault.
[00:56:36] We're going to be light. It's going to take us an hour and we're going to win. That doesn't mean you
[00:56:42] leave everything. Light infantry creates a shock effect by the suddenness and fierceness of their attacks.
[00:56:50] Check. Attacks are closely synchronized, which is fine. Again, you have to coordinate things.
[00:57:04] So that perfect synchronicity is not a requirement for success because perfect synchronicity is
[00:57:13] likely not going to happen. If you don't put some fudge in your schedule for the manufacturing
[00:57:20] of your new item, the chances that every piece of that item that your manufacturing comes out
[00:57:27] exactly as desired and then fits perfectly with the rest of the pieces that you've
[00:57:33] manufactured. The chances of that happening are very small. So if you put everything
[00:57:38] reliant on perfect synchronization, you're dumb. We don't want to do that.
[00:57:47] Can are there situations where you do need to do that? Sure. You're launching a freaking
[00:57:55] rocket in the space. You know what I mean? So you've got NASA. You've got all these people
[00:58:01] focused on one thing that literally cannot have any issues. So there's all these checks and balances
[00:58:10] the whole way through and you have actually get a very, very, very high probability of success.
[00:58:17] However, it's still not perfect. And if you tried to keep going until everything was perfect,
[00:58:22] you wouldn't ever launch a rocket because you can't get everything completely square in a way.
[00:58:26] So if you're not at risk of losing a $500 billion or whatever trillion dollar rocket
[00:58:34] and you what you're trying to do is get a get something to market. You need to not rely on
[00:58:43] perfect synchronization. Things won't be perfectly synchronized. You need to be okay with that.
[00:58:48] If you have a propensity to be super-animal-retensive about every little thing,
[00:58:52] it's going to be hard for you to be in a leadership position without letting some of that go.
[00:58:55] You have to be like, no, you know, it's pretty close. There's some people that cannot say that.
[00:59:01] There's some people that cannot say, that's pretty close. That'll work.
[00:59:06] Yeah, isn't that one of the main initial challenges of becoming like, uh, what do you call us?
[00:59:10] We've got to start delegating when you have a growth situation or whatever. Like, that's the main one.
[00:59:15] I would say I'm absolutely right. Or it's one of the main ones. Yeah. Or you can't like,
[00:59:19] can't let it go. I would buy this perfectly. Cool. But you have 14 other things you need to
[00:59:24] focus on. Yeah. Get a grip. Light infantry always. And that is italicized in the text.
[00:59:35] When you're on an English major, they call things the text. Like,
[00:59:42] are you referring to the text? Yeah. What's the difference between the text and the copy?
[00:59:47] Uh, copies what they say in, uh, in, um, I think that's more of like a marketing word.
[00:59:54] Marketing though. Like, hey, did you can you check the copy on this latest thing?
[00:59:58] So those parts. So it's like the purpose of what has been written. That kind of dictates
[01:00:03] whether you call it the text or the text. Yeah. But the English, you know, professors. Yeah.
[01:00:07] I think it's an elevated way of speaking. Because they don't want to say,
[01:00:11] what would you think of this book? Right? That's what my human would say.
[01:00:15] They say, well, I'm a person with that. They say, don't you give me some food back on on this text?
[01:00:20] They're like, well, man. Right? They're getting paid money. That's what they can't just call it a book.
[01:00:28] I know. That's why we're reporting the other way. Did you read the play?
[01:00:31] What do you think of that play? No, it's how to, was the impact of that text on you? Come on.
[01:00:39] Yeah. It's not even necessary. Sometimes. Then again, I'm sure there's a real
[01:00:43] reason, you know. No, you're right. You're right. There is a reason. And if we,
[01:00:49] where I'm sure we're going to get some English professor that's going to drop the hammer of
[01:00:54] grammar on us. Yeah. You don't say, well, text actually refers to blah, blah. Yeah. That's one of
[01:01:00] those things where it could be where you know how like there was a reason back in the day where
[01:01:04] the reason was like significant. And you could get it. You could jam it up if you didn't like this
[01:01:07] day or distinguish whatever. And then, but so much has happened since then. And then, you know, the
[01:01:12] classic, you know, guys or whatever they're like holding on to it saying like, no, it is
[01:01:16] important and all the stuff is like, no, it's not because I know exactly you're talking about
[01:01:20] still. But you know what I love about this particular case? Guess what a text now means. I
[01:01:25] said you are four one text. That's my kids text each other. Yeah. And they, they got funny text.
[01:01:35] Maya. So you know how, I don't know my son when he texts, there's you know how, well, I have an
[01:01:44] iPhone and it has an auto correct, right? So it automatically capitalizes letters, automatically
[01:01:49] puts periods. And that's how that's this. That's the default setting. I'm pretty sure of the phone, right?
[01:01:54] Thanks. He must have manually goes in there and removes those. So everything he writes is just no
[01:02:02] no corrections, no capitalization and no punctuation of any kind. It's just words. It's just
[01:02:11] uncapitalized words. And then my kids were telling me, if you put a period, if you, if you text
[01:02:20] me echo when you're like, hey, can you make it to dinner tonight? And I write no period, the period's
[01:02:28] kind of like aggressive. Yeah. Right. I don't forget if you told me that. Oh, man. Yeah, that's crazy.
[01:02:34] How how this whole like, we'll say for like, my culture texting culture and takes on this whole,
[01:02:41] like these rules and etiquette and all this and that's crazy. It's like if if something's in all
[01:02:46] cat, well, I guess if it was in all caps, it'd be more of an exclamation, right? Even I think all
[01:02:50] caps is like all caps is straight up almost like fighting words, right? If I'm all capping you,
[01:02:57] oh yeah. It's where it's going. But that's like carry over from even before text messaging went.
[01:03:02] The all caps is like an exclamation. That was your jam in the beginning, all caps?
[01:03:07] What, what did I all get? When you started texting? Oh, like when I started texting you? Yeah. Well,
[01:03:12] you didn't text everyone like that. It was just me. You didn't really know. You saw all these
[01:03:16] texts in all caps. Like you just thought that that was just more dope. Well, that's funny. You know,
[01:03:24] it's funny. I write in all caps. You know, it was like that writes in all caps. So I guess for me,
[01:03:29] it would just look normal. Yep. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. You know, like some people
[01:03:33] though, right? And I used to do this. I went through fees all caps. But the capitals were just a little bit bigger
[01:03:38] with bigger figures. Yeah. I will do that depending on the scenario. And I'll give you an example.
[01:03:45] When I write the path, that tea is a little bit bigger than the peas a little bit bigger.
[01:03:50] Gotcha. Because we're acknowledging the capitalization. Actually, now I think about it. You and I are very,
[01:03:58] very aware of capitalization of letters in text. Yeah. Well, yeah. They tell a story.
[01:04:06] They tell stories. They need something. Yeah. And then there's a difference between font and
[01:04:13] typeface. I'm unfamiliar. I don't know what it is. So you brought up something you have no,
[01:04:18] no, no, we're talking about text. Like, okay. So text back in the days, like the text,
[01:04:23] and now it morphed probably a couple of times into different things. And then now,
[01:04:27] so tell me there's a difference between font and typeface. Yeah. That's another example of like
[01:04:32] these things that might have had a difference at some point. But I don't know what it is. Like font.
[01:04:37] Like what is font? You don't know what font is. I think I do. Okay. Font is just the
[01:04:42] letters that are used to, it's the design of the letters. Yeah. Actually, it was kind of a letter.
[01:04:49] Yeah. And then typeface. That's what apparently typeface is. The design of the letters. I don't
[01:04:54] know if there's any difference between these two. Yeah, man. So typeface is the elevated expression.
[01:04:59] I think. I think so. Check. All right. Back to this italicized word. Light infantry always
[01:05:07] relies on surprise achieved through stealth, deception, silence, and maneuver on foot. I just
[01:05:16] will question mark next to like always. Always. We want to be careful about saying always.
[01:05:23] But I wanted to reflect the text here itself. Light infantry always seek to retain the initiative.
[01:05:31] Now that one, the always, which in this case isn't italicized, I agree with. Do you ever want
[01:05:39] to give up the initiative? No, you don't. You always want to maintain the initiative. I'm
[01:05:45] scrambling my brain trying to think of a situation where you know what? I don't think I want the
[01:05:48] initiative right now. I can't think of one. I can't think of one. Light forces practice
[01:05:56] rigorous fire discipline, but when necessary, they deliver intense fires on short duration to
[01:06:01] over and well the enemy. Check. Light infantry turns the enemy's weapons against him.
[01:06:09] Awesome. Which is, and what's awesome about that is when you've got, what you've got a competitor
[01:06:16] that is utilizing something. They're utilizing something. They're utilizing a, some piece of marketing.
[01:06:24] They're utilizing some attack on your clients. They're utilizing something. You can't just say,
[01:06:29] oh no, that piece of marketing really hurts us. No, you need to look at that. How can we turn
[01:06:33] that piece of marketing against them? Light infantry forces conduct relentless pursuit of
[01:06:41] enemy light forces and irregular forces to destroy them in detail. Relentless pursuit of enemy
[01:06:50] light forces. Light infantry offensive operations are characterized by a high degree of decentralization.
[01:06:58] Yes, which is contrary to saying, I better have radio to coordinate every single movement with you.
[01:07:04] That's centralized. Light infantry patrols relentlessly and aggressively ambushes the enemy.
[01:07:11] Light infantry sometimes double times into battle. Think about that. You're like, hey, we're running.
[01:07:18] We're running. That's an interesting thing. I'm concerned. I'm a little bit concerned.
[01:07:26] If I have to run to get to the battle, I'm a little bit concerned about what I'm doing.
[01:07:30] Because I'm running, I feel like I'm late. If I have to run to battle, I feel like I'm late.
[01:07:39] It seems like that's like a flex move as well. Conquer. Yeah. It's sort of like, will run.
[01:07:47] I'm not sure if that's a smartest thing. I'm running. That means I'm late and now I'm tired when I show up.
[01:07:51] Yeah, a little bit more. I mean, I'm not saying you can't function. I'm saying you're a little
[01:07:54] more tired than you would have been. Do we get a cool flex, right? Do we get to say,
[01:07:58] we'll run? Yeah. We'll run. It could have been, it could be, I guess, under certain circumstances,
[01:08:06] be like a psychological warfare situation. Because in football, that's what was, where it's like
[01:08:10] hustle off the field, hustle on the field, right? When you think about, okay, there might be a
[01:08:14] time saving element to that for sure. But, Brad, if I'm really not hustling on and off the field,
[01:08:19] I got more energy for the play. I'll tell you what, when you run, when, like, you see,
[01:08:24] kids wrestling and one kid runs, like they go out of bounds, one kid runs back, runs back,
[01:08:31] meet, you know, toll on the line, ready. And the other kids, 100, go with psychological warfare.
[01:08:37] Yeah, psychological warfare. Maybe that's why they're, maybe I think, right, I think it might be
[01:08:43] in the parlance of our time. A little flex. Light infantry tracks, listens,
[01:08:50] locates, cuts off raids, and ambushes the enemy. Isn't that weird to think about? When you're,
[01:08:57] when you're competing against someone, you actually should think you should be tracking,
[01:09:01] listening, locating, cut off, raiding and ambushing them. Think about, the thing that I like about
[01:09:08] that is your focus on them. The thing I don't like about it is your focus on them. Right? There's
[01:09:12] a little dichotomy there. We can't be focused so much on what the other guy's doing. We need to be
[01:09:18] doing something. The enemy never knows where the light infantry is or when he will attack.
[01:09:28] Check. Don't give away your position for the 50 millionth time. I'm not going to,
[01:09:35] when Eko has a different viewpoint than me, I don't start off by telling him my viewpoint and
[01:09:41] explaining why my viewpoint is better. I don't, I actually ask more questions about your viewpoint
[01:09:45] and trying to understand your viewpoint and get your viewpoint till I actually know exactly where it is
[01:09:50] before I review my position.
[01:09:56] Standing operating procedures are used widely by light forces for quick silent action. Yes,
[01:10:03] standard operating procedures. For silent action, I mean, you don't have to talk. We know what's
[01:10:08] going to happen. Next one, rehearsals, training, pre-combat briefings and sharing of information
[01:10:16] to the lowest levels are more common among light forces. This is the cornerstone of decentralized command.
[01:10:24] rehearsal is training, pre-combat briefings, all that stuff. The infiltration of large units
[01:10:30] of light infantry is possible in close terrain and is necessary for success in major operations.
[01:10:35] Under these conditions, light forces infiltrate to attack the rear, to establish blocking positions,
[01:10:40] and to create obstacles in the path of a retreating enemy.
[01:10:46] Yeah, check. What that means is we're moving into good positions.
[01:10:55] And we're doing it in a clandestine manner so the enemy doesn't know that what we're doing.
[01:11:00] And the last one for offense is hand-to-hand combat is a required skill for the light infantry.
[01:11:07] Affirmative. Man, the propagation of hand-to-hand combat right now
[01:11:15] in the last sense of UFC started is insane. Yeah. It's insane. Yeah. Yep, it is. I mean, even in
[01:11:24] that community, it's insane. Not to mention like when you explore the spectrum of the guy who
[01:11:31] doesn't know anything versus the guy, he's the guy who knows a lot. Even within the people of
[01:11:39] who knows it's so much variety. It's so vast, you know. It is insane evolution.
[01:11:48] And since 1993, it's crazy. The evolution since 1993. Since the ultimate fighting championship,
[01:11:57] the evolution of combat sports is almost incomprehensible. Yeah. Because before then,
[01:12:03] it's kind of like people didn't really have a valid stable, we'll say, a reliable foundation
[01:12:08] of fighting. And then kind of you just to kind of essentially provide it that. And everyone's
[01:12:13] are learning it. So what does it look like? This is kind of the answer. The answer to this question is
[01:12:18] what you're talking about. Like what does it look like when everyone knows the foundation? I
[01:12:22] imagine we can build on it. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess there's other thing. I mean, if you look at
[01:12:27] basketball, right? I mean, basketball now is different than it was in 1954. It's a different game.
[01:12:37] I mean, we're talking. It's a different game. But I think that's less obviously, I think mixed
[01:12:43] martial arts is might be the most, but skateboarding. You seen what a kid will do on skateboard
[01:12:49] right now? Yeah. It's my debugging. Surfing. I mean, surfing is nuts. Yeah. It's nuts.
[01:12:58] What guys are doing from a technical level, from a technical blasting heirs. Like what?
[01:13:04] But not only that blasting 360, all the aires where they're not even, they're not touching
[01:13:10] their board, but they're going up and doing a 360 in the air and landing it. If you brought an
[01:13:16] old school surfer from 1962, yeah. And if you were to bring a, if you were to bring a 1962
[01:13:23] surfer and say, hey, if you go back to 1962 instead, do you think that a surfer will be able to launch
[01:13:30] off the wave into the air? Turn 360 degrees without touching his board and land. Does that sound
[01:13:37] possible? Do you know what I mean? Does that sound? Does that actually sound possible?
[01:13:44] It doesn't, it's kind of hard to, it's kind of hard to comprehend that that could be an actual thing.
[01:13:50] Yeah. You know, they probably would be, what do you mean not touch the board? Meaning not grab that
[01:13:54] board. They didn't even understand grabbing the board. Like you wouldn't probably had to say that
[01:13:57] part. Like how are you going to get a board out of the water? First of all, their board weighs
[01:14:02] 42 pounds made a red wood. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks a lot. So there's these, like you said, there's a
[01:14:11] foundation. Once this foundation gets created, you get to build on it. And what's, that's what's
[01:14:16] so crazy. I've been talking about this on the debrief a little bit. I've been talking about
[01:14:19] an EF online leadership. There's a base there, but people just ignore it. People think,
[01:14:25] well, they, they don't understand that leadership is a skill. Just like just like surfing,
[01:14:30] just like skateboarding, just like playing basketball. It's a skill. And if you learn,
[01:14:37] then you, if you pick up a book and you read, you'll learn about it and you go, oh, I can use these
[01:14:42] moves and people don't do that. People don't understand why it's very difficult for people
[01:14:48] to understand that leadership is a skill. Even though they go, that guy's a great leader.
[01:14:52] They think that that person was just blowing that way. They don't think what they're actually doing.
[01:14:59] I mean, when I was running the training, and I got to watch, that's what made it. So
[01:15:05] I'm like, oh, that guy's not doing what that other guy did. And that's why they're falling apart
[01:15:10] right now. Got it. Check. Next section is called The Defense. Light forces can
[01:15:22] defend, but they are more suited to the offense. Defense can immobilize the light infantry
[01:15:27] consumed to much ammunition and develop rigidity of mind. These are the dangers of the defense
[01:15:34] for light infantry. So, you know, we're, we're not feeling like we're, we're going to focus on that.
[01:15:42] Light forces must be able to disappear into the ground rapidly for defense. Light infantry
[01:15:47] men must be good diggers and fast. Light infantry men must be masters of fortifications.
[01:15:56] It seems like we're focusing a lot to be going on master of fortification if that's not something
[01:15:59] we really want to be doing. Light forces defend on the reverse slope. I like that one because
[01:16:04] that's using the terrain to defend. Spoiling attacks are a frequent tactic of light forces.
[01:16:11] Normally light forces are ill-armed to defend against armored vehicles even in close terrain.
[01:16:20] This is a very important one. Why? Because it is acknowledging one of our weaknesses.
[01:16:26] It's acknowledging one of our weaknesses. So, here we are. We have this tough mentality. What is it?
[01:16:32] The never say die mentality. We adapt. We overcome and we have that mindset. And we're in a
[01:16:38] light infantry platoon. We're out there and all of a sudden we see armored vehicles coming.
[01:16:42] And we go, you know what? Adapt to overcome. We can we can do this. And what this is saying is actually no.
[01:16:49] There's actually no. We are ill-armed. So now we see armored vehicles coming. We say,
[01:16:54] you know what, hey, we need a bag out of here. We need to get in a serious defense position.
[01:16:58] Or we need a hide so we don't get seen. So, as a leader, you need to recognize what your
[01:17:04] weaknesses are. And then you need to actually explain those to the team. Hey, this is not a fight we
[01:17:08] want to get into. Hey, this other, this other manufacturer wants to go toe to toe to us on making this
[01:17:16] highly regulated item. We are not good at making highly regulated items. We don't want to get in that fight.
[01:17:27] Now, everybody knows that. Hey, you want to spend a bunch of money on a bunch of equipment that
[01:17:30] costs a lot. And then you get scrutinized over the production that you're making. That's not what the
[01:17:34] game would. And you go ahead and have that game. So you need to understand what your weaknesses
[01:17:38] are and then you need to propagate those to the team. Light infantry counter attacks immediately to
[01:17:47] retake lost key terrain or to hit the enemy's rear or flank while he is attacking. This is what I
[01:17:52] like about this is this is a mindset. This is a standard operating procedure. When we get attacked
[01:17:59] if we start to lose to if we lose terrain, just everybody know that we're coming back. We're going to
[01:18:04] immediately retake. That's what we're doing. The light infantryman is invisible and silent in the
[01:18:13] defense by day or by night. Good way to do defense. Not be seen. Logistical support,
[01:18:24] true light infantry is not tied to a supply line light infantryman. Distain logistics. That's so strong.
[01:18:30] That's so strong. As an important planning factor, they can always quote, make do.
[01:18:38] Distain's a strong word. Distain's a strong word. Yeah, in a way, doesn't that kind of
[01:18:45] makes it seem like you're painting yourself in a corner. You know, we're anti this almost. Yeah.
[01:18:50] Yeah. And I get it. I get it because it's because logistics becomes mission creep. Meaning,
[01:18:56] hey, look, we just, you know what, we're going to need water. And we're going to need water.
[01:19:02] Buffalo's, you know, one of Buffalo's big tanks of water. What any water Buffalo's?
[01:19:07] And that means we're going to need vehicles to tell the water buffalo's. And that means we're
[01:19:10] need fuel for those vehicles. And that means we're going to need to maintenance crew for those vehicles.
[01:19:15] And that means we're going to need to feed the maintenance crew. You see where this is going.
[01:19:18] Yeah. Right. So that's why I think we need to be careful when we open the door to large logistics,
[01:19:23] because once we open the door, the freaking party gets crashed. And now all of a sudden, we got, you know,
[01:19:29] the cops get called. Yeah. So we've got to be careful on that in that regard.
[01:19:37] Light forces can operate separated from their lines of communications by depending on enemy and
[01:19:42] indigenous supplies. Cool. Light infantrymen can live off the land like echo Charles can.
[01:19:51] I can't wait. I can't wait to see the governments on this one. But we could do some really
[01:19:55] funny stuff with you, you know, lost an LA. What's he going to do? Okay, motel eight.
[01:20:04] It looks like a police. I think I found. I think I found a location from the layout for the night.
[01:20:10] What the? Yeah.
[01:20:16] Light forces make maximum use of the indigenous population for bearers, handbladers,
[01:20:21] soldiers, loaders, and so forth. Look, this goes back to us earlier, forming relationship with the
[01:20:26] local populace. You need to make sure you emphasize that with the team. Otherwise, what do you have?
[01:20:34] You have young men with machine guns and grenades. And that's what they joined the military to do
[01:20:41] in most cases. So some people came in with more idealistic visions than that, which is great.
[01:20:46] God bless. But a lot of 18-year-old young men that joined the military
[01:20:53] didn't join for those idealistic reasons. So if we don't get them on board with the
[01:20:59] treating the indigenous population with respect and explaining how that indigenous population
[01:21:04] can help us succeed in our mission and explain that we are actually there to support the
[01:21:08] indigenous population. If we don't do those things as leaders, we're going to end up screwing things up.
[01:21:15] Light infantry frequently resupplies at night. The use of helicopters and phobias craft
[01:21:20] and like craft is vital to the resupplies of light infantry.
[01:21:24] The main thing is that the military improvisation is a constant feature of light infantry logistics.
[01:21:32] I'll say this about improvisation. You can train for improvisation.
[01:21:40] And the way you train people to improvise is by making them improvise. That's what you do.
[01:21:47] You can't, and what makes it hard is training by its nature is a structured thing. I'm
[01:21:54] going to set up some training for you. Echo trials. Here's what we're going to do.
[01:21:57] You're going to start in the mount. You're going to go for a walk. You're going to start here.
[01:22:01] So there's a structure to it. And we can go through that structure and I told you what move you're
[01:22:05] going to do and you're going to drill that move. So what I need to do is put you in situations
[01:22:10] where there is no move. Hey, get on your back, put your left leg over your right elbow,
[01:22:17] and your partner is going to go and grab your other ankle. Ready, go. You have to improvise.
[01:22:22] Get out of there. You can actually start to learn to improvise better. So we need to do that when we train
[01:22:28] subordinate leadership when we train our teams. We need to put them in situations that they
[01:22:31] actually have to improvise because there's methodologies and thought processes that fall into
[01:22:37] better improvisation improvisation. If you never think about it and you throw your team into such
[01:22:44] situation and guess what? You throw your team into any real situation. They're going to have to improvise.
[01:22:49] That plan is not going to be perfect. And if you don't train them to improvise, they're not going to be
[01:22:53] able to do it. Technology. Next section, weapons used by light forces must not impose a logistical
[01:23:04] burden. Cool. If equipment cannot be man packed or muel slash donkey pack, the light infantry
[01:23:13] generally has little use for it. Cool. We're trying to stay light. Light. The helicopter is
[01:23:19] almost revolutionary and it's effects on light force, mobility and logistical support. Check.
[01:23:27] The delivery of the light infantrymen into the area of operations has changed over time,
[01:23:32] but actions on the ground have changed little check. Historically,
[01:23:38] advantages in technology have not been the deciding factor in light infantry operations. This
[01:23:45] is important. So we can't just rely on the fancy new equipment that we've got obviously,
[01:23:52] that's not going to make the difference. It's not going to make the critical difference. It
[01:23:57] might have a difference. It might make an impact. But historically, technology is not going to
[01:24:02] be the deciding factor. Next section is called political arena. Political action is often
[01:24:10] needed to support the light infantry operations. Cool. You know what that means? Play the game.
[01:24:15] Grab play the game. Light infantry profits from a psychological operations edge
[01:24:24] and must be prepared to use this advantage. All kinds of psychological things,
[01:24:31] all these, the shock that we're talking about, the surprise that we're talking about.
[01:24:37] Those things are a psychological advantage. And we need to be able to exploit those psychological
[01:24:45] advantages. Utilize them. Cooperation between a light infantry security force and the local
[01:24:53] police and intelligent structure is essential to success. What does that mean? Build relationships.
[01:25:04] The hearts and minds roll in low intensity conflict is one to which the light infantry
[01:25:11] normally is very sensitive. I would say that the light infantry should be very sensitive to it.
[01:25:19] But I also think if we as leaders don't explain to the team the importance of the quote
[01:25:27] hearts and minds, then we will not have them as sensitive as they should be. I don't think there's a
[01:25:36] predisposed mindset that leans towards people that join the military thinking hearts and minds.
[01:25:45] Thank you. Have to account for the fact that there's a decent chance they're not thinking
[01:25:48] about the hearts and minds. The last section is leadership. Light infantry leaders are generally
[01:26:01] of higher quality than conventional infantry leaders. I don't agree with that. I give that one
[01:26:10] on the down vote. I worked with conventional infantry leaders and they're freaking awesome. I've
[01:26:17] worked with light infantry leaders and they're also awesome. I don't think they're generally
[01:26:22] of a higher quality. Light infantry leader traits are imagination. Isn't that funny the first
[01:26:31] one imagination? The next one flexibility? The next one hardiness? The next one
[01:26:39] endurance, confidence, improvisation, discipline, technical expertise, perseverance, and so forth.
[01:26:50] Can we or do say so forth? Because you listed one two three four five six seven eight nine
[01:26:56] ten. It's like more. Yeah, but imagination and flexibility. That is not what people think of when
[01:27:06] they think of military leaders. They don't think of imagination and flexibility. They actually
[01:27:10] think of the opposite. Regided. Yeah, can you say that too right? Where? Or actually it might
[01:27:16] have been another book where creativity was one of the attributes of the leader or whatever.
[01:27:21] And you wouldn't really think that you wouldn't think creativity. It's more like, I don't know,
[01:27:26] maybe the first thing that comes to mind maybe for a normal person would be, I don't know, authority
[01:27:30] years. You know, something a little bit more free. Yeah. Right. And I talk about discipline all the
[01:27:35] time, but this one's only good if it's complemented by imagination and flexibility.
[01:27:42] Light leaders lead from the front. Consequently, they suffer a higher ratio of casualties than
[01:27:46] normal. I don't think this is something that we're super trying to make a proverb. Right?
[01:27:56] I get lead from the front. Absolutely. But are we are we actually leading from the front to a point
[01:28:05] where we're a higher level of casualty as a leader? I'm not going to, I'm going to say, if I'm
[01:28:12] talking to my leaders, I'm going to say, listen, you lead from the front and you also position yourself
[01:28:17] to where you can continue to lead without becoming casualty. Leadership is the most important thing
[01:28:22] on the battlefield. For losing leaders, we are losing the most important thing on the battlefield.
[01:28:29] I get it. I get the attitude, but we have to make sure we're smart about it.
[01:28:40] Junior officers and noncommissioned officers must possess skills above and beyond those of regular
[01:28:46] infantry. The skills include demolitions, artillery calls for fire, the use of closer support
[01:28:51] and familiarity with foreign weapons and foreign languages. Fair enough. Fair enough. That comes
[01:29:02] down to all those things, all those things are just training. So when you're in light infantry units,
[01:29:08] you should have the opportunity for more training. You can get some of these skills. Teamworked
[01:29:14] and confidence in each other are vital to light infantry operations. Teamwork and confidence in each
[01:29:26] other. That is a huge piece of teamwork. I call this trust as opposed to confidence in each other.
[01:29:38] That's what bonds a team together. I trust you. You trust me. You trust that I'll be there
[01:29:44] if you need me. I trust that you'll be there if I need you. And if I can trust that you're
[01:29:49] going to be there if I need you, I'm more apt to go out and make something happen because I know
[01:29:53] you got my back. Here's a good one. Courage without teamwork is of little value.
[01:30:03] Makes sense. They didn't say it's of no value, but if I don't have some teamwork back in
[01:30:08] me up when I do something courageous, not what we're looking for. We need teamwork.
[01:30:15] Moral, a spree and spiritual power are of high value to light infantry operations.
[01:30:23] What is a spree? A spree to court. It's like the bond, the bond that we have.
[01:30:29] So there's not much clarification on spiritual power. I'm going to go out
[01:30:38] on a limb and say that the team has to believe in what they're doing. If you're going to be
[01:30:44] successful, if the team doesn't believe in what they're doing, it's going to be a problem.
[01:30:48] Because we are not willing to make sacrifices for things we don't believe in.
[01:30:57] Light infantry men usually leave no casualties on the battlefield. I like that.
[01:31:03] It could be a little bit stronger than usually. Almost never.
[01:31:10] And that's different from the army saying of leave no man behind and actually that's all
[01:31:16] services say that. And that's always the goal. But you also have to make a call sometimes.
[01:31:26] And that might be, hey, we need to back off right now. We need to come back and reattach this
[01:31:29] position later. Because right now if we keep going to try and recover this individual,
[01:31:35] we're all gonna die.
[01:31:41] Light infantry men look to their leaders at 4 a clear voice for clear voice instructions and
[01:31:47] thrive on the motivation of visually observing their leaders in action.
[01:31:54] Cool.
[01:31:54] Necessary sometimes. Clear voice instructions absolutely. Sometimes the team
[01:32:01] actually has to see what you're doing and they will take action based on your performance.
[01:32:06] They will be inspired and motivated by seeing up. Looks like we're going
[01:32:12] in the last one, a light infantry leader can do everything a soldier can do and more.
[01:32:19] Now listen, on that one, you're not going to be able to do a hundred percent of what your
[01:32:36] frontline troops can do. And you definitely might not be able, you certainly might not be able
[01:32:42] to do more. Right? You've snipers gonna be better at shooting with you. The radio man's gonna
[01:32:46] do more about the radio than you. The point man's gonna understand the route better than you do.
[01:32:53] So that's a little bit. Not sure I agree with that.
[01:32:58] It should be a little, you shouldn't know how to do it. You know how to do all those things,
[01:33:01] but you're not going to be the expert. But you should absolutely do more.
[01:33:08] If you're in a leadership position, you should do more. More work, more effort, more sweat,
[01:33:15] more toil, and grind, and more exertion because you work for them.
[01:33:23] And that's what a leader does. So there you go. That's the document. Short, sweet,
[01:33:32] proverbs of the light infantry. Good things to think about applies to many aspects of life.
[01:33:41] You disagreed with a few things. The amount that you disagree with is actually pretty small when
[01:33:50] you consider. This was written 50 something years ago. That's pretty impressive staying power
[01:33:56] as far as all those concepts go. Yep. And I don't know if we'll ever hear from major Scott
[01:34:00] R. Mick Michael, US Army. But if we do, I'm sure he could clarify some of these and explain him
[01:34:06] in a different tone or a different aspects or perspective that I don't understand. Also, you know,
[01:34:14] the time that it's written in 1980 something, 1985 maybe. So my guess is as a major,
[01:34:23] he probably wasn't likely wasn't in Vietnam unless he was an enlisted guy in Vietnam,
[01:34:28] just doing the timeline. So maybe bounce in these things off the wars and Iraq and Afghanistan would
[01:34:34] actually, I think if we discussed him, I think we would come to some kind of resolution on some
[01:34:41] of these, you know, maybe that I didn't understand it correctly or I didn't see what the perspective
[01:34:46] that he was talking about. So, you know, and he might also be like, yeah, you know what,
[01:34:51] I didn't fully, I didn't fully calculate that aspect of it. Yeah. So, but yeah, I mean, the vast majority
[01:34:58] of them are very, I'm in total agreement with. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of times when those, when the language
[01:35:04] is that of always and never. So that tends to make it the very least feel like, okay,
[01:35:12] there are no real exceptions to that. And then as time goes on, you can start to see the exceptions.
[01:35:20] And then, you know, how one exception kind of can kind of open the flood gates for others, you know,
[01:35:25] and you're like, oh, wait, we're seeing this exception kind of often, oh, shoot, we should maybe
[01:35:29] re-valuate or update that always. Yeah. It's like often, often or, you know, tens not to or something like this,
[01:35:37] you know, got to be careful with always never. Got to. Thanks. All right. Well, speaking of doing more,
[01:35:45] it seems like we should do more, more work, more effort, more toil. Yeah. You said something
[01:35:51] really interesting right there at the end. So you work for them. Yeah. It's not as intuitive as one might
[01:35:58] think when you're in the position, you know, it's a leader. It seems like they work for you. If you don't
[01:36:03] have that intuition, you need to write that on your, you know, on the cover of your notebook. Yeah.
[01:36:10] So I have kids and that's another one, right? Where it's kind of like, it's almost like, it's not,
[01:36:15] I don't want to say intuitive because intuitive is wrong. We're more like on the surface. Like on the
[01:36:19] surface, the kids got to listen to you, you know, but no, like you're the one who you're essentially
[01:36:26] working for them. You're a job to get them up to speed, you know, all this stuff. Yeah.
[01:36:33] I don't know. It's weird. No, there comes a point when they're going to be working for you doing
[01:36:37] them dishes. I'm cleaning and catching. I'm not ignoring the benefits of the kids doing the
[01:36:47] dishes instead of me now. I'm not ignoring the benefits of that. But that's not why you teach
[01:36:55] your kids to do the dishes so they can do them for you, you know? That's not the primary reason.
[01:36:59] It's not the primary, well, it may be the primary reason, but it's not the most important reason.
[01:37:07] Okay, my, well, emphasis on the word might not love that. So like, I never, like, I always feel bad.
[01:37:13] So let's say, okay, so one of my kids has a chore. It's real, by the way. So one of my kids has a list of
[01:37:19] chores. I've noticed that a lot of your hypothetical situations are just real.
[01:37:26] Yes, yes, yes, you give a lot of, let's say there's by the way, this is real. Okay, so let's just call
[01:37:33] it what it is. But there's a reason I do it only because I don't need you asking all these very
[01:37:37] specific questions necessarily, not necessarily you, but other people ask me these specific
[01:37:41] questions and then now on a rack yourself out. Yeah, well, there might be that too. But I,
[01:37:47] I usually am looking for the answer that applies to more than just me in my solidest of
[01:37:50] existence. You're trying to broaden the expansive your question, trying to get a check.
[01:37:56] So always appreciate it. If let's say the chores are to one of the chores is to
[01:38:04] load the dishwasher. Okay, put all the dirt dishes in the dishwasher. But let's say this child,
[01:38:10] um, didn't eat dinner with us. They went out with their friends for dinner. They came home. They
[01:38:14] got to do their chores every night. Yeah. Meanwhile, they got to load the dishwasher all our dishes.
[01:38:19] All the people, you know, it doesn't seem right. It just on the surface it just seems like all this
[01:38:23] kind of wrong, you know. Doesn't seem right to who me. Oh, making them do that. Okay,
[01:38:28] like it's like, what are you my servant? Now you got to clean up my mess. You didn't even
[01:38:32] participate with me. You know, it's like they kind of feels that way for me. Echo Charles the Merciful.
[01:38:36] But there's a bigger picture than that. Yeah. Where his job is that for a reason. It's not to clean
[01:38:44] up after me. It's to teach him that in life like these things have to be right. Like things that
[01:38:51] you can do, you know, to function. So it goes beyond that big of a skill. So you got to suck it up, you know.
[01:38:56] Yeah. Yeah. But also you need to explain why. Right. You need to explain why. Yeah. And if you
[01:39:03] explain the why, then they go, yeah, you know what that makes sense. Yeah. You can't say because I told
[01:39:07] you do. You can't say because I'm the dad. Need to say, well, here's what's going on. Yeah.
[01:39:14] Boom. Ask them what you call it. Yeah. I think it's this is the technique in sales where you ask
[01:39:18] them like questions with only one answer, you know, like, or it's basically this like if you
[01:39:24] they say, why kind of eat this cup cake or whatever. And I'll be like, hey, you know, cup cakes aren't
[01:39:29] good for you, right? And usually that just goes right over their head. It likes not good for me. Really
[01:39:32] because it seems really good right now, you know, as far as I'm concerned. So I'm like, okay,
[01:39:37] if this cup cake makes you less healthy, less the healthy other person. And one of my jobs
[01:39:42] on my many is to look up for you, your well-being and your health. And I allow you to eat this cup
[01:39:48] cake, would I be being a good dad? They can never say yes. Sometimes I'll say yes as a joke. But they understand.
[01:39:53] But they know what's up. You know, put the cup cake down. You know, explaining why I'm doing what I'm
[01:39:58] doing. Whether it's quickly biting off the frost like what is frosting anyways? I think sugar butter
[01:40:06] a lot of butter and sugar. And then there's like, I don't know if some vanilla, maybe some cream or
[01:40:10] salt. It takes most I would say 70% of the cakes I've eaten in my life were only the cake itself not
[01:40:20] good. But the first thing when I was a little kid, right? Yeah, yeah. I wanted to get that corner
[01:40:26] piece that was had frosting on the floor. It's the first time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, good. Right?
[01:40:30] Were you in that game? Or were you taking a middle piece that had one side of frosting? Yeah. So oddly
[01:40:35] and when I was a kid, yes, but as I grew up, it's probably just a maturity thing. Really? You know,
[01:40:40] you know, like, I like less, less frosting. You didn't matured of that. I didn't mature out of that.
[01:40:44] Yeah. In fact, I, you know, I won't want to eat the cake because that's we know that's just
[01:40:49] weakness, right? Yeah, put the frosting that's where the stranger like, you know what, I don't even
[01:40:52] need to eat the cake. But maybe a little knife, snatch full of freaking frosting, which I don't
[01:40:59] even know what it was until you just told me. Yeah. Well, I understand. So there you go. It makes sense
[01:41:04] as opposed to say the brownies where you want the middle piece of the brownie because that's a
[01:41:07] softer one. Oh, I like the brownie that's a little bit like the hardened part, you know,
[01:41:12] around. Oh, so do you like the edges? Yeah, I guess it depends on the name when you're a kid,
[01:41:16] like when I'm just, this is all just when I was a kid, you know, you're just in the game, right?
[01:41:20] You just, you're tracking sugar like a little addict. Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to pee
[01:41:25] Roberts's level. Did you hear? Yeah. When pee Roberts was talking about having damp,
[01:41:30] sugar cubes hidden in a tensile hole, they're hidden in his room. Yeah, that's going hard. He's
[01:41:35] going hard for sure. Like that's, that's some weird phrase. Yeah. You're definitely the guy looks
[01:41:41] against a look on his face where it comes to sweet and stuff. Look, I got a sweet,
[01:41:45] she's sure what I have her man. He starts losing his mind, bro. Yeah. Oh, that's right. That's
[01:41:51] where we had that guy. He wasn't on the podcast. It was when we were up and up in Montana.
[01:41:56] And he was starting going all sugar crazy on me. Started getting the wildfires.
[01:41:59] So I get crazy. I was both talking about sugar. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:42:03] Man. That's why he's a good test for Jockel fuel because he's got to sweet a legit, like certified
[01:42:08] lifelong sweet tooth. Yeah. We're talking in a crackhead of that's got sugar cubes. Yeah.
[01:42:15] And he gets a weird twinkle in his eye when he starts talking about he's sugar cubes. He's a
[01:42:19] good test for Jockel fuel because he's not in here going, you know, it tastes pretty good. Like he will
[01:42:23] straight reject something. Yeah. If it doesn't, if it doesn't have that sweet little kicker,
[01:42:31] it's true. He's not down for the cause Pete Roberts. Oh, yeah. And you get a health person who's
[01:42:35] down always down for the, you know, playing chicken breasts and broccoli and all this stuff. That guy
[01:42:40] who's like down for that kind of stuff and then he's going to taste some, you know, some peanut butter
[01:42:45] chocolate, malk or whatever. And the thing is not where it needs to be sweetness flavor. Why is
[01:42:51] he's going to be like, oh yeah, man. That's pretty interesting. He's a chicken breast broccoli guy. He's
[01:42:55] that. Wow. Man. This is amazing. Might be a little too sweet. Pete Roberts like, you know,
[01:43:00] if you don't, if you don't knock it out of the park with Pete, he, you know, he's like whatever.
[01:43:05] You know, he's over there freaking crawling around looking for sugar. You just pop the crack up.
[01:43:11] Oh, he's doing a piece. He's doing great. Speaking of jacophu, what do we got? Yeah. So
[01:43:19] yeah, forget about the cupcakes and all this stuff or whatever. You know, if, if we know
[01:43:24] that eating cupcakes, sugar, butter, frosting, brownies, sugar cubes, if we know that that's bad
[01:43:30] for us makes us less healthy. And we have to be more healthy to be more capable to help the
[01:43:37] people that we work for. Yeah. We still eat this stuff. Are we being a good leader? Good leader,
[01:43:47] good dad, good mom, good parent, good friend, good brother, good sister, good compatriot, good human
[01:43:54] being good sisters freaking no nude. Negative answers freaking negative. And I get it things tastes
[01:44:00] good, I guess one. Good news. I got good news across the board. Okay, first off, before we get to the
[01:44:04] two good of the news, the great news. Maybe some guidelines. Okay, we want to be working out
[01:44:09] we want to stay healthy. We want to stay capable. We want to stay mentally and physically
[01:44:15] in the game. We'll say we're going to stand in this earth. We're all on. All right. So you might
[01:44:19] need some supplementation. I'll help you. Big time. Chocolate supplement. If you're going hard,
[01:44:24] I'm going to say you're going to need supplementation. Yeah. If you're going hard, you're going to
[01:44:28] need supplementation. If you're pushing hard, you're going to need supplements. Yep. And we got a bunch.
[01:44:33] So let's start with a physical and cognitive discipline. It's the name discipline. Many modes
[01:44:38] get the energy drink. We'll home ready to drink cans. No, let's just go I guess. The the
[01:44:44] capsules and the powder called discipline. So the energy drink cans, they're available in multiple
[01:44:52] places. Wow. He's close. He's close. Jocophonefuel.com online. Vitamin shop. Is that everywhere?
[01:45:01] Yep. Worldwide. World shop. Boom. There you go. Only in America. But yeah, it's the boom.
[01:45:06] Multiple options as far as the where to get it. This is just energy drink cans. Vitamin
[01:45:10] shop has everything else. Yeah. This is all that we're about to talk about. Okay. So what are
[01:45:14] those things? Other supplementation joint warfare. A joint warfare and superkilled oil. This
[01:45:19] is for your joints and some general health stuff in there as well. That'll keep you in the game
[01:45:23] big time, especially on the on the physical front. Also, vitamin D3 and cold war for immunity.
[01:45:30] Stay in the game. Don't worry about getting sick anymore. That's a thing. You start over training.
[01:45:34] That's sleeping enough. All this stuff. Right. Sickness will come and get you. Take you out for a little
[01:45:39] while. If you just let that happen, are you being a good leader? Are you? No. That's good. You're
[01:45:45] letting down everybody. You're kind of nervous. That was this book. You read it on podcast.
[01:45:51] And it really, this thing stuck with me because I kind of had this inkling of this concept.
[01:45:56] But I never could really arrive at it and embrace it as much until I heard it. Where it's like,
[01:46:00] it's like, I forget the exact words, but it said, like, if you get sick, that's kind of your
[01:46:06] phone. Don't let your own thing affect the team kind of thing. It was like, oh, it was one of these
[01:46:11] things. Where it's kind of like, if you get, it was kind of kind of raw because sometimes,
[01:46:17] right, you just get sick. You get it. It does happen. Dissentry or something to think. You know,
[01:46:21] it's like, sure, you can take measures to try to avoid it. But sometimes, on avoidable,
[01:46:25] this in the book you read and was like, still, that's your bad. Don't let that jerk. Was that?
[01:46:29] I forget. But it was like, man, your personal shit. Don't, don't even come over here with that stuff.
[01:46:34] You better keep, keep moving kind of a thing. Chuck. It's like, dang it. Trying to figure out what
[01:46:38] book that was, we'll, we'll go back to it. Yeah. But it was, it is interesting. So let's say we
[01:46:44] apply that philosophy. Boom. We got some measures, some significant measures. That's a vitamin D.
[01:46:50] Three, by the way. And also the Cold War for you, me and any boom. Also, the good news that I was
[01:46:57] about to present, we got protein supplementation, but we don't need cupcakes anymore. It replaces
[01:47:03] the cupcakes and the frosting. Don't need frosting certified, accepted taste by Pete Roberts,
[01:47:12] the sugar cube addict. It's just a good thing in this case, as far as like, what do you call
[01:47:17] credentials? Yeah. So yes, best tasting protein on the market. Straight up in the world. Yeah.
[01:47:24] Straight up. Straight up. Check it out. Also, all this stuff, if you want to get it for free,
[01:47:31] shipped to your house, you go to jockelfield.com. If you subscribe to one of these things,
[01:47:35] you'll get it for free, shipping for free, which is, that's what we're doing to compete with
[01:47:41] other, you know, we're talking about big guys, little guys today, big companies, little companies.
[01:47:45] We got big companies out there that are like shipping stuff for free, which is good. They have
[01:47:51] the capacity to do that. How do we compete with them? Cool. We figured out away. Subscribe
[01:47:57] free shipping. That works. So there you go. There's an example, real world example of the
[01:48:02] light infantry mindset going against the big heavy hitters out there. It's true. That's a big deal
[01:48:08] of free shipping. Sometimes some of us, you know, when we check out, we see a free shipping.
[01:48:14] That's nice. That's it. In it. So yeah. Also, do you just have stuff? Because we're doing
[01:48:19] you just enough. We're back in the game. We're back. Coronavirus. I remember that. Yeah.
[01:48:25] You know, that was a thing back in the day. But we're back to in GG2. So you need some GG2
[01:48:31] G's, rash guards, other equipment. Go to origin. USA.com. That's where you can get them.
[01:48:36] It's all American made stuff. Yeah. And just stuff for like wearing too. Like things to cover
[01:48:42] your legs in called pants. The best pants ever. You know, Delta jeans. Get factory jeans too.
[01:48:48] If you're living up north, we understand. You're probably going to get the factory jeans. They're
[01:48:52] heavier. If you're living down south or you're living out the west coast, you're probably
[01:48:56] looking at the Delta 68 jeans and boots. You get boots. Yeah. Are they doing that wallet? Or
[01:49:04] the SP kind of flexing on us? Do you want to do it? Yeah. There's a couple versions of the
[01:49:08] wallet. There's like that reals. What a slim. Yeah. Minimal. Whatever. Pied called it concealed care.
[01:49:17] Yeah. Yeah. You guys, you guys up there all cracked out on sugar cubes. What is
[01:49:21] a continued carry wallet? Probably one. But like it is cool because every time like because
[01:49:30] a wallet, you don't just automatically think, or I don't anyway, but when you will help us
[01:49:33] it out, you can tell like, you know, you took some pride in that one. Do it. So they put out some
[01:49:38] cool stuff. Yeah. No, well, P takes massive pride in the whole process from designing it and
[01:49:44] then the functionality of it and then the production of it. Yeah. Because think about, think about
[01:49:48] something's going from his head. From his head to people's hands passing through the company
[01:49:56] being built by the factory. Like it's awesome. So the whole, everyone there, everyone there
[01:50:03] when a wallet goes and when a pair of boots goes out, everybody there's pride all over that stuff.
[01:50:08] Yeah. It's like you got to represent, right? You can't just be throwing in some half thought
[01:50:12] idea and be like, hey, try this and then show everybody. It's like, bro, we're not doing that
[01:50:16] and stuff. We're going to all of them. Yeah. That's what we're doing. We're not throwing something
[01:50:20] together. This is all in cereal. So is P proud? Yeah. Is every person that's on the line creating
[01:50:26] this stuff proud? Hell yeah. It's freaking legit. Makes sense. Also speaking of legit, Jacoa's star,
[01:50:33] this one equals freedom, shirts and hats and hoodies. Some match cards on there. Um, some more
[01:50:38] kids stuff on there. Some soap on there. Jaco's soap, trooper soap, killer soap and the bacterial
[01:50:42] charcoal activated. So, sorry. So, oh, this stuff. Um, yeah. So if you want to represent,
[01:50:51] while you're on this path, you know, this is where you can, you can get your attire, your gear.
[01:50:57] Also, we have a subscription situation there too. shirts. Interesting designs. Creative.
[01:51:02] You're wearing one right now. If you want to go on YouTube and look at the current shirt that
[01:51:06] echo Charles is wearing. Unableable, by the way, you missed it. A lot of people have it,
[01:51:11] you know, they're representing. But here's the thing, every time you're learning and you're coming
[01:51:15] up with more dope designs. Sure. I tried to keep a standard quality level. Whatever. Either way,
[01:51:22] it's fun. Um, yes, it's called the shirt lockers. So yeah, man, sign up for that. You know, if you're
[01:51:27] interested and check out everything else on their Jaco store.com, like something. Subscribe to the podcast.
[01:51:35] Also, check out the Jaco unravelling podcast with Darryl Cooper. We've been getting kind of
[01:51:40] crazy with those. Getting nuts, as they say, but they'll freaking awesome feedback. We'll
[01:51:46] keep knocking about grounded podcast. We talked to Dean Lest. We're getting all those out pretty
[01:51:50] soon. Order your kid podcast and you can also join us in the underground. So so we have an alternative
[01:52:00] platform that we are, we have created so that we have control if contingencies unfold that we need
[01:52:09] to execute an alternative platform. We're not doing it. We hope to not do it. But things are strange
[01:52:14] in the world. So Jaco on a ground.com, if you want to help support the the alternate world,
[01:52:21] if needed, you can you can pay $8.18 a month. And we're doing like a unadditional podcast where we talk
[01:52:28] about it. Just really interesting stuff. That's not quite Jaco podcast material, but it's Jaco
[01:52:34] life material. Alternative and amplifying information. Yeah, and look, if you just, if you can't
[01:52:44] afford that, no factor. Email assistance at jockelwinderground.com. We're just trying to make
[01:52:50] sure we're taking care of and your taken care of. Should things start to go sideways. We also have
[01:52:55] a YouTube channel where I and the assistant director for some awesome videos and then echo put some
[01:53:01] videos on there too. Unraveling is on there too. By the way, all of them? No, but they're they're
[01:53:07] getting rolled out as well. Yeah, I've got a new one up there. That's good to hear. Yeah, those
[01:53:12] unraveling podcasts. I can't be interested to read the comments on those. Yeah, so that's a thing
[01:53:19] because those really run the risk and they have a head like a, no, YouTube will fly it because
[01:53:26] of the material. Anytime you and Darrell Cooper start talking about genocides and all the, you know,
[01:53:31] the brutal, we're selling it on deep of history and you know, whatever it's like YouTube's like,
[01:53:37] oh, you pump your brakes there. One time we were talking about something and Darrell's like,
[01:53:42] you know, this is this particular thing is really bad and it's just not appropriate. No,
[01:53:47] not what you want to hear in a podcast. We got Donald's like, Hey, bro, I don't never want to hear
[01:53:50] that again. He's like, I'll never say it again. Like, that's what we're doing. You know, if we don't
[01:53:54] address, if we don't address and inform people about what happens when things go sideways,
[01:54:00] then people will realize how bad it is. That's what happens. So yeah, we're getting flagged,
[01:54:06] getting censored, must be 18 or older. You'd think that we were putting out freaking pornographic
[01:54:11] material. We're not. We're talking about what communism does. We're talking about what authoritarian
[01:54:17] governments can do. Yeah. Yeah. It didn't, it never got, you know, deep into history in high school
[01:54:24] and all this stuff or whatever, but kind of the thing of this is going to be known news to you,
[01:54:28] obviously, but when you do presented in such an interesting way or whatever, it one of the many
[01:54:34] valuable things you can get from it is like, yeah, you realize how bad it was back then. And at
[01:54:38] the same time by contrast, you realize, oh, today isn't that bad. Even the bad stuff that happens
[01:54:44] like, man, you kind of compare to the whole of the thing. It starts to, it starts to offer this,
[01:54:49] this may be more enlightened perspective on things. Well, yeah, and it also offers you
[01:54:55] an understanding of why things are happening and how things happen. Because look, just like
[01:55:02] leadership is something that you can learn about from the past, so is everything else and to
[01:55:08] sit here and think that we're in a you totally unique time. And that nothing like this is ever
[01:55:14] happened before. It'll be different this time. That's freaking wrong. That's just wrong. The way that
[01:55:21] the world works, the way human nature works doesn't change. And there might be different technology,
[01:55:26] but just like technology won't make the difference in light infantry battle, technology will not
[01:55:31] change human nature. It'll have influence over it. But we need to watch out for what we need to
[01:55:36] watch out for. Human nature inherently does the same things over and over again. So let's be careful.
[01:55:44] Check out the unraveling. Check out Darryl Cooper's podcast, Margar made. Right now there's a lot
[01:55:48] of there's a flare up going on in the middle east. You want to get the background on that. You
[01:55:52] want to try and you want to get some understanding of what's going on in the middle east. You don't
[01:55:56] know. I'm going to tell you you don't know. And I studied the middle east and the conflicts in
[01:56:01] the middle east. Darryl Cooper's podcast, Margar made is a doctorate in what happened in the
[01:56:10] Israeli Palestinian scenario situation. So check that thing out if you can. Psychological warfare.

[01:56:51] some words. You're hearing about the story. You're kind of wondering what the hell is this about. So

[01:59:46] correctional officers, border patrol, secret service and all first responders. Thank you for your
[01:59:52] sacrifices to protect us here at home. And everyone else out there, you might not be a light
[02:00:00] infantry soldier or leader, but you can certainly adopt the attitude of the light infantry, the offensive
