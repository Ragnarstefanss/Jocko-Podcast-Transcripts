but maybe like as a person you know How like like you you know confide in hall like all have a problem come in It'll be like hey, let me get your advice whatever about something that obviously it didn't feel yeah like appropriate to like just ask all my friends kind of thing, you know like Do you ever do that This this I think applies to To most scenario where Like you be think of the big picture where if you're like hey, I'm gonna consider myself After everything's gonna be said and done, you know it kind of goes along with what you said like oh can you stand up and you You if you consider okay look back you're gonna they're because it's gonna come a point where you're gonna look back on this They what I know might not work That's it then you know so that that means you got to have an open mind then you got to remember of course that rules Sometimes after break rules You have to be very judicious when you decide you're gonna break rules and there's some principles that That you cannot violate without massive Reason without a massively heavy reason and a way to mitigate the risks of breaking whatever those fundamentals are like cover move like there Cover move you should never violate cover move ever Except for when it just makes sense that you need to violate So that and that story right there are kind of leads into the first question of Q and I which we haven't had Q and Q and A in a while and the first question is Well go ahead first question first question You recently said hackworth was a rule follower most of his career but in about face the book He always talks about how he went against his command his rules how do you play the game but also act like hackworth So even if you're not in the, or if you're in a situation where someone's close to you, like, lost someone, it's good to keep like something like this in my knee, you know, that it's going to come and go, you know, because it's easy to be like, oh, yeah, like, oh, so what you do is you tell her like hey just Can can we make this work and actually whatever however this gets in the way of us you know like whatever like I Want to just in general make that up to some way you know like what can you what can I do for you You know it's like that kind of situation I want to mess that Exactly, so it kind of shapes up to be like that you know where it's like for sure We both know whatever it's There that's it's so bad to the point where one When when I got with my current life from where we started dating whatever like it's just having you know Like even you like same thing, you know like you'll you'll give me crap. And we were pretty far along in the training and we were Starting to get our our semi-unition Which is like fake bullets our semi-unition and paint ball wars on Forsohn force training and we were doing Like multi day operations So almost like a scenario like you've got a full scenario going on like there's bad guys in the city There's anything We were like we're not gonna say because you know we and we call it clear and you say next room and all this other stuff We weren't gonna say anything We're just gonna stay quiet so we went all the way up the stairs really quietly we walk in and we can hear him Hear him yelling out the window like come but you better get him quick and all this stuff You think I got two hours a week think about what two hours two hours is like a massive amount of time Yeah, that's a good two hours is a huge amount of time Unless give that away you own a commercial gym then you want to mop that floor Cuz it adds to the functionality Yeah, you're gonna you're gonna get the floor is gonna be clean. I'm gonna go so hard That it's gonna get nuts like we're gonna get it done and then when if we fall short Which we will because I figured out there's no physical humanly possible way to make this happen Then what I'm gonna do is I will go to them and I'll explain The things that I am going to do differently next time in order to meet their goals right? There's a couple chapters you could focus on one of them is called resolute but not overbearing one of them is called disciplined but not rigid One of them is called hold people accountable, but don't hold their hands And and this is pretty much why we had to write the dichotomy of leadership because you're out there good on you trying to take extreme ownership And that's great, but you're not you're not paying attention to the dichotomy of leadership So let me let me break it down for you a little bit more clearly and then you can go read the book as well, which will help you You say that the stakes are only a clean fryer and not lives and You're right Lives are not at stake and neither really is the functionality of the fire itself Because it doesn't have to be completely spotless and in fact if you're trying to keep it completely spotless It might actually waste time that she could be doing something that's more important like Prepping the potatoes or washing her hands to keep the food sanitary So you need to think about that how Truly important like when you say on when I say because I say this all time and I apologize for throwing you a little bit Too far in one direction unmitigated daily discipline in all things. You need my help with the kids and then Be like but hey this this sort of this means a lot to me and it makes me feel good makes me you know a happy person Whatever it can mean you can we make this work you know can we do what you know how you like this other thing Yeah, they fully says some about people aspiring leaders right if you're an aspiring leader Don't feel like you're the person that has to always come up with a plan or come up with a solution Even when you are the leader don't feel like you're that guy in fact it's better to not do that It's better just to to think and to just listen to what people are saying and watch their plans Come out and get shot down and get reformulated and be improved and if you hadn't said anything yet Guess what the longer you don't say anything the more people are gonna listen when you actually open your mouth It's going to feel like you are Drowning in sorrow like you're not going to get in any air and like you're not going to be able to escape that sadness That's what the waves feel like at first and you know obviously Situation some situations are more like more serious, you know like you're not gonna I don't know A lot of the time it's like they're literally the opposite decision You're like Especially if it's one of those like go along with the crowd kind of scenarios, you know where's like all that? Well, let me tell you how here's my plan In six years, you know, I'm a purple belt right now in six years I'm gonna get my black belt and when I get my black belt we're gonna open a school when I open a school guess what we're gonna do all day We're gonna teach you to get you Yeah, and as speaking from person who doesn't necessarily well It doesn't seem like I necessarily get that big of a payoff to have that to like I'm running this, you know like I don't know for whatever reason didn't I? Right like wow if I go 110% right not even on a person beyond you're gonna give everything you can is it achievable Because a lot of times people will do it's an ultimatum can't make it well as a Member of a team I Want people's attitude to be like you know what? When He when he got out when they kind of drove him out after he did the big interview where he said hey we're not gonna win They went and drilled down into his camps and looked at the things that he had gone on there Said oh you were you're allowing this to happen you're allowing this to happen so he left himself a little bit vulnerable By breaking the rules a little bit too much so the a rule to learn from that is like don't do things that people can hold over you and for me The things that people can hold over you are things where you can't stand up and Say yes, that's what I did I can't remember times like guys guys just be like Like They wouldn't be like well, I don't know jacco. Let's finish a prod let's do something productive and if there's something That distracts you that's fine do it Let let let let there be some calm in the water and Also As the as the calm comes Also you're gonna find moments where it's like you can you can have things that are gonna bring on the waves And that's okay to Bring on the waves go look at the pictures right down the memories read the letters read the notes read the emails Remember But here's the deal if you're in the military and you got spun up about little things that don't really matter You are wasting your leadership capital and When something it actually important it's what you were just talking about echo when something actually important comes up Your troops aren't even going to listen to you because they don't know what anything They don't know what's important and what's not because you say that everything is important Like hey, why do I need to stay on watch? You know what decision you made and how you made to think to tell kids to You know like would you if you're if you're at a party or you're wherever and something's going on would you be proud to stand up and be Hey here was the situation and I this is what I did and this is why I did it if you can't Maybe you should really reconsider what your actions are gonna be no man. you know, but You have to allow other people to come up with plans the other thing is recognize That the the way you know of doing something might not fit you might not know everything It's it's a good thing to always think to yourself you might not know everything Yeah, so it's essentially like hey, man identify the use the the optimal use of the fryer and Let's target that is like the bet the right way to clean it kind of thing You know Yeah, like every the oh will be like oh sure at all, you know like press not even something it's Something they sell men shirts where you bought that That's what you feel like, you know, but yeah, on the other side is kind of like, no, yeah, that's what they would want you to do kind of thing. I'll explain to them What you know what why I can't I'm not gonna be able to physically get this done it's just physically not possible and then You know what the short falls are gonna be now and once I explain that to him if they're if they're completely unwavering Because if you explain everything and you put your data together and you say look the bottom line is to do To to assemble this many pieces by our best two people on the team It takes them an hour each and you want us to assemble 14 of them in three hours. and You're gonna feel the way you're gonna feel right now, but later on how are you gonna feel about like how you handled it We think would be the best lighting system you know like I know what I think that's the see that's the thing I don't really divulge is I know what I think you and I have very line vision about something You know well, so when it comes to the technical Nature of what the podcast the table we were not I want to bought that table Ever well, I wouldn't have bought that table for like a like a prop to be used in a one-scene scenario I don't know what that Right, so if you want to act like an idiot guess what it's gonna be on CNN because someone's got a camera Somewhere around there and you might as well be saying that today as a kid as a teenager Yeah, you might as well be saying yep, this is this is the next viral video This is my 15 minutes of fame is gonna be me doing whatever I'm doing right I've let other people tell me what their ideas are first I want to hear What they come up with because if and if somebody comes up with a good plan We're going with it like if it's a thing you know what that's pretty good plan. And so and he would laugh at us, you know we'd be moving through a building and you could hear him like If he shot you in the neck and he'd be aiming for your neck or you're nuts like he was gonna get you Have a good time with it Yeah, can you lean in by the way the better just like anything else just like hack worth the better relationship that you build with your wife and with your kids Guess what the more flexibility you have the more the way they give you The worse Relationship you build with your wife and kids the less flexible and the less leeway and the less chicken breast you're gonna have cook for you They're not in the game with you That's that's what it is be like hey this means a lot to me, you know To and usually you know in a relationship like that they care if something means something to your husband or wife or whatever So the title of chapter continues It's the title of the chapter is own it all comma but Empower others And it sounds like this individual who's getting after it for sure props getting after it leadership position multiple organizations Going hard taking ownership Very cool, but it sounds like he needs to lean more towards decentralized command Because just because you take ownership of things doesn't mean you're supposed to do everything That you take ownership of it doesn't it doesn't actually doesn't work what this what you need Individual is you need Subordinate leaders Inside these multiple organizations that you're in charge of that you trust and so they died we saved we got so my point in this is that Sometimes you have to do things That the enemy's not gonna expect that people aren't gonna expect that your competitors not gonna expect The hard part about doing that It isn't actually doing the thing that they don't expect right I'm not the guy who all tease someone and try to like make them You know, especially if I don't know good or whatever, but um, but if you're around someone who like can't really take it Explain to them Why you're not going to dwell in their loss And explain to them how in losing them you have learned without a shred of Doubt how truly precious life is And that they have taught you The immeasurable value of your own life and your wife's life and your family's life And explain to them that you know That you know that they loved you and that you know that they would want more than anything for you to be happy and productive and impactful in the world And explain in that letter what you will do to make them proud of how you live your life Hey week We will do our best here's the shortfalls you know whatever That's the way it is yeah, and that's a big one here like where Kind of learn this from you where it's because you can Like to tell you I can't this can't be done like you kind of you get to the point in your mind where like We both know it can be done, but I was just you know given my current rescuing sleep schedule Yeah, you know if I come in and say hey We're you know, hey, what do you think kind of table we should get for the podcast what you know I mean what do you think? I'm gonna say listen, you know what I I should have asked you earlier if this was a possible thing and I should have had a Back-up plan so here's what I'm putting into place now to make sure this does not happen again or hey I am going to need more manpower so that if we run into this again, I've got the people it's my fault for not staffing us up correctly or I need to pay more attention to what's happening in the future so that I can have a better Aware I have better awareness of when this type of situation will unfold so I can have my team prepared for it or these complexities that happened I didn't explain to them. Whatever they're calling you whatever You're gonna sort of feel it on the inside still but just don't behave you know in a way Just like I don't know. They're gonna do what I talked about in that opening story which is they're gonna they're gonna be at low altitude They're gonna be staring at it right in the face You know, you know what I've talked about, like the person that's in a turmoil in their heads in a cloud of like a storm cloud. But you know kind with the two handles the two strings you know you had a See I'm saying you got a kind of pull one and let one go a little bit to and then it depends on the wind you know Depends on how strong the wind is
