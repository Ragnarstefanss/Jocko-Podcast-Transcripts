but if you go on on the on it on it on it website you can get stuck on there for a long time just reading all the stuff about it you know like that the krill oil was one and I know about krill oil from long time and they're krill or like these little they're like little shrimp basically teeny tanger you know so teeny tiny shrimp Yeah, and when you have that much of a discrepancy between like a certain element of people's game, like in, and I think Jiu Jitsu tends to be the more prevalent, because a lot of times people would be like, oh, well, certain guys, let's say like a chocolate or a clay guida, they're like, hey, these aren't, well, actually, we'll just say chocolate del. i'm just showing up and talking so appreciate the support so echoes not coming out a pocket for the gig if you want to connect with us if you want to continue these conversations if you want to ask questions and we got some great questions tonight for sure if you want to roll up to you can connect to us through the interwebs on twitter um at jockel willink and of course echo Charles is at echo Charles and i'm going to start a facebook page i think and echo Charles is going to start a facebook page that'll be good i think and thanks for leaving reviews in the podcast on iTunes that's kind of how another way that the word gets spread and of the book stream ownership on amazon.com that also helps us and finally if you really want to help me get out there in the world in your car in the train at your apartment at your house wherever you are at work or at play get out there and get after it so until next time this is jockel and echo out but as always you take that opportunity to make yourself better faster smarter stronger and with those goals nothing is ever finished so thanks to everybody for tuning in to the podcast and listening to it thanks for subscribing and reviewing and spreading the word tell another people about the podcast thanks to on it dot com for the support and what do we got with amazon dot com for support I put a little link again both the websites where you can like give you shop at amazon it's like an affiliate it's like just a way to support this podcast if you shop on amazon you click through there first and it kind of gives us a referral kind of fee you know you know and if you're working out you're gonna eat a little bit more that's how you get big muscles work out good and have the correct workout for muscles which is different kind of work out then if you want to you know get conditioning or something like that and then eat it enough that's what you got to do and eat right after you work out I'm gonna be honest I don't know if I should take a pre workout pre workout is just you know what that is right you just like a little powder it's like is a stimulant it's caffeine in it typically in n02 nitric nitric oxide it basically makes your it basil dilate to you so your vessels get dilated so it you get more of a pompe gives you energy it's just like it's basically stimulant energy So that discipline, like I said, it starts with the shaving and the next thing you're not boiling the water, the next thing you know you're sick and the next thing you're crapping all over the place and the next thing you know other people you're making other people sick, and it starts with the discipline. And I can tell you that there's a lot of lessons that were learned by those Russians on the ground, that were absolutely implemented by American forces in, I know in Romadi, absolutely the amount of similarities for that urban combat, and the things that we watched out for, because of the sacrifices made by the Russian soldiers, I'd say, how do you jump back and I'm glad that we were able to take away some lessons and take those to the battlefield in Romadi, and do things like protect the local populace, and do things like understand their culture. you know what I mean people probably want to know what supplements you take people mainly would ask me that in college it's when everyone wants to hear what's something because they think for some reason that supplements give you big muscles or something they don't they don't think about that whole working out yeah if you click through the website you get you know we get like a little percentage or whatever it's like a referral thing and your book is actually on there as well extreme ownership nice nice like that Oh, what you don't feel good, you know, business business, you know, you don't feel good about it, but that's kind of the fuel, you know, the fuel, it's, I even do it. but that's in specific cases only with jujitsu like if I'm doing like conditioning like now like a matconner something I won't take it because you don't want to give yourself the extra edge but the skill itself of throwing the baseball of shooting a basketball of throwing a football is not as valuable as a skill as number one a martial artist you know moly tie boxing wrestling GJ2 because those are real applicable to life 100% and this is the same thing with shooting a gut I mean that is a real applicable skill that you may need at some point in your life and you should have it you know what supplements do you and echo take what supplements do you take well my number one supplement is steak steak yes beautiful steak that's the number one What if, you know, you're kind of like, you're like this raging hurricane that when it comes by, it turns into like a warm gentle breeze. so that's that's the supplements that I take you know one thing that's been really cool is is picking up a sponsorship from on it for the podcast you know from Joe who's obviously been a big supporter he's actually the reason that we're sitting here right now because Joe Rogan I mean Tim Ferriss had the same thing with Joe Rogan said you need to have your own podcast it's real in-depthing you get stuck on this real interesting too because they tell you like what are the benefits you know how do they know that these benefits are there because you can't just say hey take this little cure this you can't just do that you got to go through this process but everything else like something you get free shipping also which is kind of seems like a small deal and doing the cuz I've sold things online and stuff before like insurance and that's the none of the stuff is here and of course I bought things online yeah it's like it seems like if I'm free just for conditioning it's kind of like I want to do the mat yeah that's it that's pretty much it it's funny because a lot of people they think that if you take protein powder it'll make your muscles big like it'll help you get big muscles but no like if you take your favorite supplement which is steak just eat normal And that's one of the things that I really like about the simulation training or paint ball training or laser tag training is it allows you to have somebody else shoot back it to you, which is just like just like rolling in GJT or sparring more Thai or sparring MMA right I think it's safe to say I don't feel uncomfortable by saying there was a little bit of a cardio deficit that would be reached very quick I'll echo Charles on the mat so more accurately being tired was more of an issue for me like dealing with being tired you know certain people will get tired Yeah, because we never hear any of this stuff like growing up, you know, you say, okay, don't blame, but it's, it's not like a real strong message that you're saying growing up. that's it that's all the supplements right there I will take the krill oil though for sure because that's gonna help me last question juggle I would enjoy hearing your thoughts on leading others to a strong finish in both a deployment and in the civilian life this is this is something that I saw in combat even on my first deployment to Iraq and it's something that I tried to train out of people and that was a tendency to relax once a target was secure or the vehicles were loaded and we were leaving the target area people would have a tendency to let their guard down but you can't let your guard down then or ever really and in training when I was running training we always hit the platoon's hard on target I mean, maybe not the way people picture martial arts nowadays, because when you picture martial art, people picture, you know, a guy with a guy doing karate. oh and they give us a discount so or so on it is giving our listeners a discount like 10% my people and what I did find out on it regardless of whatever discount you get they you have free shipping on everything except I want to say that the big oh I don't know it's done but we always we always hit him even harder after they left the target once they were patroling back to base and their mind hit already gone home and then turned off and that's when we bring it to him be hit him from multiple angles with all kinds of man because I wanted to instill into them I wanted to instill that attitude the muscle memory to always keep going and always stay focused because that's the mentality that you have to have is that it's never finished it is never finished you always have to do more another mission another task another goal and have that attitude that the enemy is always watching and waiting and looking and studying you for that moment of weakness looking for you to exhale put your weapon down and close your eyes that's when they attack so my rule is don't be finished be starting be ready be attacking be relentless let the enemy stop let the enemy rest let the enemy finish but you don't finish don't stop don't rest not until the enemy is completely destroyed and even then even then when the enemy is gone that's when you turn that focus inward on yourself and you take the opportunity not to rest You just have to know Jiu Jitsu, and if you don't know it or know very little, you, I'd say the chances of you getting exposed is really high. and that's what it boils down to so that kind of thing is is very important in as far as being a martial art and you should train you know that's another thing you know for lack of that away putting it but how they get it is like it's all eco friendly where it doesn't destroy the or affect the ecosystem even the big ship the vessel that they used to to to harvest the the krill is like low emissions specifically certified like You know, in success, now you have yet another division that's going to get some solid training, you know, yeah, for sure. Like those situations like in Gigi to do situational training that would be like okay here half guard. yeah to be honest over the krill oil I don't know maybe like seven years ago or something at some point I went from fish oil to krill oil I had a friend that was came over to the house one time and he was you know a Marine and we got in the conversation and all of a sudden you know my son comes out with the laser tag guns and my son's So he walks out and sure enough my son had run around the block gotten into that related position and as soon as he came walking out my son sort of drilling him and the guy's like he freezes it's interesting like he freezes he doesn't even think to myself So knowing Jiu Jitsu saying like you need to know Jiu Jitsu doesn't necessarily mean you gotta be a black belt in Jiu Jitsu, or you have to have the slickest sharpest submissions necessarily. I so when I take the stream tech sport you could feel I could feel like it's like you almost like you'd expect to get more tired than you really are that's what I felt you know I eat a lot of coconut oil whenever I get the chance I like dipping things in coconut oil coconut oil is if you get a taste for it it's a really nice tasting thing And you know, when somebody asks me a question like this, it really signifies to me that, it makes me nervous because I think to myself, I say this all the time. and then in jacco they care less about muscles there they'll be like you know it's actually you get kind of tease sometimes in jacco if you have big muscles it's weird you don't get teased but yeah that's a good way good deal cool couple ways to support the podcast and the on it stuff is pretty obvious when you go on there you can click on there click on that link to if you're going to shot if you're going to get alphabraner or or a true attacker or krill or whatever whatever all the dope stuff on there There are these little nerf laser tag guns and you could shoot each other at I don't know maybe a hundred meters which is a pretty good shot as like a pistol. but he was a competitive power lifter when he was younger and he was in really good shape and this is probably when I was what was I at that that's 15 years ago or something like that I was like 30 years old and this guy looked young and healthy So there is some vertically oriented things that you have to deal with, but an urban combat every, you know, every foot can be separated by 10 stores, you know, and so it is a 360 degree environment. So, you know, guy wants to hear about buds stories and what it's like going through those stories. So there's something to think about going peacetime maintenance for good when you say, you know what, there's nothing going on right now. oh you know do you want to go and the guys like I bought two more so I could go against my son and his friends and they could go against each other and I taught my son like all the basic military maneuvers that he would need to know. Yeah, it seems that kind of etiquland or something seems like morale is kind of this extra thing. I don't, you know, you don't really think about that that much, even though after you know it, it seems real obvious. but you kind of do get every person ever roll with you know you get done rolling they're like man you're strong
