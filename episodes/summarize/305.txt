the major causes of military incompetence underneath his robust exterior richy like boulder before him an elephant stone before him lack to self confidence and seem more concerned with proving himself to himself than with prosecuting the war the presiding over interminable committee meetings through which the army was run the seeking of advice and then not taking it and the disingenuous way in which he managed to convince the commander and chief that he was protecting tobrook wall in reality leaving it to the mercy of the Germans are the actions of a man beset by inter doubts these doubts were skillfully but not perfectly concealed by his often inappropriate facade of monumental complacency now we go to sing a poor chapter 11 one can sum up by saying that those responsible for the conduct of the land campaign in Malaya committed every conceivable blunder major general woodburn curbsing a poor the chain of disaster in the nine weeks between early December 1941 and mid-February 1942 the impregnable force fortress of Singapore Europe's gateway to the east with its thriving city huge naval dockyard and strategic vital airfields fell lock stock and barrel into the hands of the Japanese the invasion of this island stronghold the complete defeat of the combined British and Australian garrison with its army navy and air force units was the ultimate unconditional surrender of the whole area was so rapid that even the Japanese were staggered indeed one almost might say non-plossed by the ease speed and enormity of their success in the long run the results of this disaster may be deemed incalculable the myth of European supremacy over ageatic peoples was exploded forever and the prestige of competence of the British military endeavor in the eyes of the world in general and American particular were damaged beyond repair in the short run Britain lost her last and strongest foothold in the far east and a polling set back for the global war effort we lost thousands of lives both military and civilian but worse perhaps than the loss of life the military debacle condemned thousands more to three and a half years in Japanese internment camps finally the economic loss ran into hundreds of millions of pounds we forfitted elaborate and expensive dock installations naval and other engineering facilities military stores fuel the major port for exporting urgently needed rubber and two new first class battleships most of these material assets fell virtually intact into the hands of the enemy thus in effect doubling their value the value of their loss to the allies like other cases we have discussed that of Singapore is essentially a human problem a product of human behavior human intellect human character in human error no explanation in terms of geography climate broad political or military considerations can possibly do justice to the facts at bottom and at the top we are confronted with issues that are primarily psychological and which only a reduction to psychological principles can possibly explain so this freaking disaster unfolds in Singapore a disaster and as you're going to see it's not about who was smart and it's not about like the military situation it's the freaking psycho pathology of the leaders let us state the problem in terms of a number of questions why was the impregnable fortress planned and serviced in such a way that while presenting apparently formidable defenses on its southern side its back and northern sure was no more of a resistance than would be invader than the back of Bournemouth why was there an almost total lack of coordination and cooperation between those who had been entrusted with the job of defending the island why was it clear that the Japanese could and would assault the island from its northern side was nothing done to erect defenses in their path why did the general officer commanding Singapore lieutenant general person of all ignore the urgent advice of his subordinate Brigadier Simpson and of his superior general wavel to implement these defenses why on the one hand was so little done to protect the civilian population against air raids and on the other so much done to prevent their knowing the true facts of the situation as these unfolded why did general personal persistent believing the Japanese would attack from the northeast when confronted with overwhelming evidence that their assault would come from the northwest why did the officer commanding the Australian forces on the island forbid his troops to escape while secretly plotting his own get away from the island finally and perhaps greatest of greatest interest how did the men who could perpetrate such colossal errors of judgment ever reach a position where this was possible it's quite the setup in 1925 there's a protracted and acrimonious argument between the army navy and air force chiefs as the housing report should be defended while the older services press for fortifications and heavy fixed guns for repelling attack from seward trenchered for the RAF advocated for a large force of aircraft to repelling attack before it could become come within range of the island need this to say the army in the navy won their case at the expense of more junior service heavy fixed armaments armaments became the order of the day this debate in which the RAF had conceded defeat had three unfortunate consequences firstly the island was left exposed and undefended on its northern side second we seen your army commanders from that time on stubbornly clung to the dog with that no Japanese would ever advance on Singapore down the Malay peninsula finally the bitter inner service quarrel which ensued resulted in an almost total lack of coordination between the three services for future reference let me say this day view have a platoon in europeal tune there's a two different let's call them clicks and they have two different ideas of what you should be focused on and how you should operate and what you do is you sort of negotiate a piece between these two clicks and you sort of compromise and you figure out this is this is where he starts his captivity I think he'd been in the army for like two or three months at this point 19 years old 138,01 event of all the instances of military incompetence considered in this book is the fall of Singapore which most clearly gives the lie to the so-called bloody full theory of military and aptitude personal was in fact highly intelligent and had shown himself in previous years to be a brilliant staff officer what he shared with other earlier military incompetence were pacivity the opposite of default aggressive by the way and courtesy rigidity and obsidency procrastination gentleness and dogmatism 138,2 battleships by the way insane the next chapter is about our name this is when we covered we covered say we covered part of Singapore obviously when we covered Alexander Erhart our then we covered podcast 94 the book was called man at arm and rid my Jeffrey Powell who was there who fought there and I think you know when you read the reading this assessment really puts it really puts that book in the perspective it starts off with this couple quotes all the accumulated evidence confirms that like gallipoli this was a British disaster where naked courage lacked the bodyguard of competent planning competent intelligence competent technology yet wars object is victory not the Victoria Cross and it was shameful that by autumn of 1944 we could still be so amateur the object is victory not the Victoria Cross we don't that's the equivalent of the metal of honor in England here's a private soldiers comments it began to seem to me that the generals had got us into something they had no business doing if it achieved nothing else operation market garden Montgomery's plan to capture and hold the bridge head across the Rhine in northern Holland at least demolishes the myth that military incompetence stems from stupidity for sheer initiative quickness of mind fortitude and selfless heroism the conduct of those who actually fought the battle has never been surpassed by the same token the men who planned and administered the operation were probably as intellectually gifted well trained professionally competent dedicated and conscientious as any military planners have ever been and yet the unfolding of market garden revealed all the symptoms of high-level military incompetence that's like in how would you feel if someone said you know what Dave your intellectually gifted well trained professionally competent dedicated and conscientious but that's what we're looking for in our leaders and yet this thing is a disaster the failure of the operation resulted from a a linked together of the following factors one as a result of his neglect to open up the port of Antwerp by clearing the shell the shell the estuary Montgomery allowed the German 15th Army to escape north into Holland where it was available to defend the approaches to Archnum two the arrival at Arnhem of 30 chord depended upon the advancing across 64 miles of enemy health territory on a one tank front along elevated unprotected highways flanked by a soft and tank and sawed and tank proof landscape interspersed with waterways any delay a blown bridge an enemy ambush a block road and the entire column would be stopped any delay and the Germans would have more time to bring up reinforcements in the event it is hardly surprising that 30 chord never did reach Arnhem that they could not achieve it even in nine days what it had been scheduled to take 48 hours now i'm going to say i know i gave credit to your 12 year old daughter and i'm going to say 12 year old daughter might not be able to figure this one out look you look and I was like hmm hide that with stifle it our second example is rather more complex concerning as it does that major obstacle to military development the horse as a noble if uncomprehending factor in military incompetence this animal was much in evidence between the war this is very interesting if you know anything about horses upon reflection is hardly resupprising that the horse became the cina quanon of military life for a thousand years met had found it in it enormous advantages there was nothing better for transportation and load hauling horses raised morale and enhanced egos horses took the weight off the feet and enabled people to go to war sitting down when they lay down you could hide behind them when it was cold you could borrow their warmth and when they died you could eat them because of the traditionally rural origins of so many army officers military families horsemanship in the context of sports like hunting became one of the preferred preferred leisure activities in such sports as polo pig sticking in an early-aged jelesting not only act out symbolic aspects of real warfare but are also associated with a higher social class there's little wonder that they should find so much favor with those who choose the army as a career all in all is not surprising that the cavalry became the branch of the army with the highest status nor is it surprising that they should have become the most vehement in the denunciation of the tank which was seen as an intrusive junior rather than the air and air apparent so they had this long fascination with the horse they love the horse the people that road horses in the cavalry ended up with a bunch of you know prestigious positions and high ranking positions and they saw the tank not as like hey this is what's going to take over the horse it's trying to it's juniors of the horse it's not as good as the horse nor is it surprising that the desire of the war office to playkate the cavalry was stronger a lot than logic not only did they veto any expansion of the tank or but under the direction among Gummery ruled that the new tank brigade should never be reassembled and this in the mid-1930s with Hitler army to the teeth that's you can't you just you have to have it you have to be a kind of like a psychopath to do this it there's a level of insanity in there it's like how how do you look at a horse in a tank and look at him go make it better that's what they did so thankfully listen we also didn't like falsify stuff all right those that's that's that's now we're moving into the second world war the pre the pre the in between war period is over nothing learned nothing figured out no no one taking blame responsibility for anything second world war there's a quote in here from La Del Hart the German success in May 1940 could easily have been prevented but for the opportunities presented to them by the allied blunders blunders that were largely due to the prevalence of outer-date ideas after an appalling start in which the allies were out fought out maneuvered and outstripped in the quality of their military thinking and equipment the second world war produced a biggest transition in military competence since though days of Wellington it was born of necessity and maybe said to have dated from Dunkirk this jolt to 100 years of military monitoring and 20 years of blind complacency achieved 3 ends within a space of days it shattered many long-held dearly loved illusions about the nature of modern war it hasten the eclipse of the old the reactionary the untalented finally by rendering the armory temporary impotent Dunkirk put the most junior service in the center of the stage Dave Burke is excited now the first time the continued existence of the army and navy became totally dependent upon their protection by the RAF look at this smile on this guy over here as for the bad start this was a legacy of factors that touched on the previous chapters rigidity of thinking over confidence resulting from a pathetic belief and antiquated methods of warfare and refusal to accept that enemy intentions may confound the armchair profits the following examples from the liberal hearts history of second war illustrate these shortcomings on January 10, 1940 a German aircraft carrying the liais on officer of the second air fleet lost its way in crash landed in Belgium by an extraordinary chance the officer was in possession of the complete operational plan for Germany's attack on the west did you hear what I just said by extraordinary chance the officer was in possession of the complete operational plan for Germany's attack on the west he tried to burn the plan but failed to complete this task before he was captured in this way its contents became known to the allies Hitler's response was to devise a new plan which involved attacking France through the Rden's rather than through Belgium as originally intended this episode was damaging to the allies for two reasons first firstly in the belief that the captured plan was a deliberate deception they failed to modify their own plans secondly contrary to advice received years earlier they clung to the belief that the wooded area of the Rden's was impossible to tanks as a result the strongest allied force remained poised for attack through Belgium while the Germans suffered little resistance to their outflanking drive through the Rden's here's another one the French they'll possessing many tanks which were as good as if not better than those the Germans were steadfast and their belief that horse to cavalry could destroy German armor in the Rden's for this reason they refused to accept the suggestion that fel trees might be used to delay the German advance like the poles they were sadly disillusioned about the outcome of a conflict between horse and tanks that's the poles and the French both making the assessment that hey you got tanks and I mean in in aviation I got the fly stealth airplanes like very modern stealth airplanes and to this day despite the insane advantage the insane advantage there is still ongoing debate over so whether or not we should have non stealth this is not this is like in fighters there's reasons I've not said that cargo planes and attack planes like but in this world of like airplane fighting against another airplane or using airplanes to get into a contested space they're still an ongoing debate of hey we should just retrofit like really nice legacy airplanes with cool cool missiles and cool engines and stuff like that my airplane is invisible my airplane is invisible you will not see it it doesn't matter how fast you can go or how much gas you can carry or how cool your weapon is you're going to lose how much longer till pilots are not doing this job fighter pilots I think we are one generation away my opinion is that the next generation which what scary is like it's much sooner it's not like 40 years from now the next generation of airplanes are going to come out in the next 15 20 years and there's going to be no pilots and you remember this is like the good guy when brigadier general simpson the chief engineer went to see major general gordon Bennett commanding the eight australian division he founded impossible to make him realize that there was an urgent need for anti take defenses at first he did not want to discuss the matter at all since he noted after the meeting since it was horrified could not the australian general understand that there was nothing on the long road to prevent the enemy from reaching them apparently gordon Bennett could not for in his diary that night he wrote malay command sent brigadier simpson to discuss with me the creation of anti-tank obstacles for you saw the road personally have little time for these obstacles preferring to stop and destroy tanks with anti-tank weapons no wonder that the japanese never slowed down no wonder that time after time troops were annihilated by skillful japanese enveloping tactics on the british side wrong decisions were made communications broke down whole pockets of troops were caught off first japanese tanks appeared and came as a great surprise to the british who had not won single tank in malaya in a jungle country where the british had insisted that tanks could never operate the japanese tanks moved easily between spacious rows of rubber tree and quote major general gordon Bennett was not to use the appropriate vernacular and isolated pocket of resistance nor did he hold the record of obscenancy in barber's words a tamps by brigadier simpson to move and add to the defenses had been blocked at every turn largely by general person who seemed to have had a fixation against such measures nothing had been done nothing was being done despite previous please a hazard of belonging to any rigidity any rigidly authoritarian hierarchical organization is that from time to time the individual out of dire necessity or from strong personal conviction feels compelled to apply pressures to those above him it is a hazard because the ethos of the organization whether it be a Victorian family and english boarding school or the british army demands that pressure always moves only in one way downwards rather than upwards to buck the system by prodding those above can have unpleasant consequences you're totally freaking rigid situation and simpson is trying simpson is trying i'm a fast for a little bit it seems that simpson was past taking no for an answer for he said to the general sir i must emphasize the urgency of doing everything to help our troops they're often only partially trained they're tired and disperse it they've been retreating for hundreds of miles and please remember sir the japanese are better trained better equipped and they're inspired by an unbroken run of victories and it has to be done now sir once the area comes under fire civilian labor will vanish he's wanting to get these just just get freaking obstacles set up the plea was forceful respectful and logical but amazingly the general remained unmoved simpson in his rising anger said look here general no hey put that thing in the water and it was like seriously like putting the water you know like that event had to occur like in real time whether there's something like hey this isn't going the way we plan let sabotage our experiment to prove our point that we've already predetermined which is planes aren't as good as ships crash that crash that drone will like we're like I Roger that's right so if you think I'm going to figure out some kind of I'm going to figure out what that list is it's like iron to wood and then getting rid of sales for steam and then from steam to what you know diesel and then from and there was people resisted every single 17 out of 20 those advancements there was resistance in nuclear reactor on a boat imagine the world does think you've ever heard right when doing a submarine are you insane can't be done can't be done as for battleships whose future usefulness and indeed very existence was threatened by the advent of aircraft quote two most admels the the respective value of battleships and aircraft was not basically a technological issue but more in the nature of a spiritual issue don't they cherished the battlefield with a religious fervor as an article of belief defying all scientific examination the blindness of hard-headed sailors to realities that were obvious to a dispassionate observer is the only explicable through is only explicable through the through understanding the place that quote ships of the line filled their hearts a battleship had long been to an admiral what a cathedral is to a bishop and you can't walk away from that I don't know if there is an equivalent in the teams if there is let me know but that description is is is is beautiful because in aviation you literally fall in love with your airplane like it's a person like it's a human being and and the degree to which you cannot see the truth is I would say on part of the degree that you can't see the flaws in your own children And if you kind of start to get to this validation like hey what I'm doing is working you know what I should do I should keep doing the same thing and that flies against what you just talked about which is the training and the evolution to think differently from what you did and one of the symbols things we see this is hey if I if I if I'm a really good at a front-line task go to that particular task I'm I'm going to get promoted and I'll be the former and if there's other team and why I'm the former is because I'm really good at the task but my job isn't to do that task anymore my job is to think strategically and lead this team and I have no skills and no training to do that because the criteria for getting promoted is being good at the task and that success and that validation sometimes not always sometimes leads them to a level that they're not capable of doing but the system doesn't allow you to give them any feedback because when you're a general officer I guess what I'm a general officer there's there's something that you said that requires a little bit more exploring and that is you said that when someone gets advanced to you know a general officer or a CEO in many cases it's based on their successes there's something else it's based on their lack of failures so you know I'm just telling you from from over here it's not it's not even close just do this because he sees it from a perspective and that's what I think that's where that that is it the level of frustration of hearing this is really hardest because hey you're there I said both actor rifle and machine gun and like go harder to you're harder so you know which is like a sling shot and a heavy machine gun automatic heavy machine gun that's how big the gap is and the only way to not see the machine gun is to be so invested and so committed to your point of view that just like we said last time you will dismiss the truth because it doesn't align with your preconceived outcome that you've created in your head which is probably to some degree the definition of being a psychotic a psychopath by the way there weren't just anti-tank and this gets in the Dave Berk territory there are anti-aircrafts too here we go for once the for once the usual rival between the two older arms sank beneath their mutual dislike of the new upstart if anything the admiral's waxed more rather more negative about aeroplanes than they did than did the generals whose minds as we have seen were already discomforted by the issue of tanks as mechanization threatened horses so aircraft threatened battleships but unlike horses and military minds battleships were only the last succession of obstacles to progressive naval thinking before battleships had been wood and before that sale each were link wishing each were licorsement and transition had been bitterly resented heavily opposed and productive of such irrational thinking as tends to occur when dearly loved objects have been renounced. and yet we're just going to go ahead and catalog them as weak demoralized it likely to collapse and by the way randomly it just if they're confronted with a large airborne attack like that's the thing because hey when you're an airborne attack because that means you you you even have anti-tank weapons barely you've got no armor this is ridiculous market garden went ahead but not so quite as planned instead of encountering a few old men who collapsed a ran away first airborne division fell upon a horn it's nest of German armor far from being demoralized the enemy fought like tigers to defend the gateway of their homeland and far from sweeping across Holland to aid the hard pressed pair troops the tanks of the second armies 30 court were reduced to a crawl by the combination of unsuitable terrain and determined opposition and this is going to finish out the section the book defeat was absolute and terrible short on everything but courage the men of first airborne division held on until their numbers had been reduced from 10,000 and five to less than a quarter of that figure total allied losses and killed wounded and missing exceeded 17,000 some 5,000 more than those who became casualties on day so there you have it defeat was absolute and terrible and that despite the fact that for the beginning of this section sheer a niffed initiative quickness of mine fortitude and self selfless heroism the conduct of those who actually fought the battle has never been surpassed and and this we want to talk about disturbing field marshal Montgomery described the mission as a 90% success that's that's how he presented it 90% success I think to be clear of anything in the aftermath of everything that has he considered it right we're marking our position to put a big orange panel number five since the airborne assault was to take place in daylight and because it was vital that thirty core should complete their journey within 48 hours 64 miles and 48 hours on the single track the whole enterprise depended upon the absence of strong German forces both in rnm area and on the approach route from the south hence it came with something as a jolt when they received reports from the Dutch underground that two SS Panzer divisions which had mysteriously disappeared sometime previously had now reappeared along sa almost alongside the dropping zone this information passed on among gummery received support from the British aerial photography of German tanks in the arnm area meanwhile forward troops in the British second army reported a buildup of German forces along their intended line of advance hmm might want to reconsider this is the moment to reassess the risks involved but since these ugly facts did not accord with what they had planned they fell upon a succession of deaf airs taking the lead from Montgomery who described the report as ridiculous British second army headquarters were quick to discount it also when one of his intelligence officers showed him the aerial photographs of a German armor general browning at first British airborne headquarters reported I wouldn't trouble myself about the use of fire were you they are probably not serviceable at any rate if there is any stronger form of just straight like denial and idiocy than that right there you get shown the first you get intel reports and then you get shown photographs of the armor tanks the German tanks on the ground and you're like they're probably not serviceable you can't make this shit up you also know that there are two divisions there that are gone it's it's they didn't appear out of nowhere you know these divisions existed i've raised this question time after time you've always refused what more you've always refused to give me any reasons at least tell me one thing why on earth are you taking this stand who's like what what the hell aren't you want me build obstacles wrong with you why not at long last the general officer commanding muleia gave his answer quote i believe the defenses of the sword you want to throw up are bad for the morale of the troops and civilians and quote since it was quote frankly horrified and remember standing there in the room suddenly feeling quite cold and realizing that except for a miracle Singapore was as good as lost as you put on his sam brown since could not for beer to make one last remark quote sir it is going to be much worse from a while if the japanese start running all over the island you can't make it that is so hard to listen to and for whatever sense of validation in my head of as soon as he said it's bad from rallin for stallus you know what's worse from rall and of course you know i don't know he's gonna say but we got horses the British retreat from the Gazale line in 1942 which resulted in the loss of towbrook followed by a headlong flight back into Egypt was the second worst disaster of the war after Dunkirk tobrook cost Britain 35 thousand casualties and an enormous loss in ground and material why did it happen inadequate general ship the army commander major general Neil Richie a fine-looking man has been described by his contemporaries in ways strikingly resembling of elf and stone raglan and boulder here's what his contemporaries had to say about him Richie was all hey wire by then all for counter-attacking in this direction one day and another the next optimistic and not and trying not to believe we had taken a knock when I reported the state of the first armor division to him at a time when I was planning to use it for a counter attack he flew to see me and almost took the view that I was being subversive another one general richie had a great air of the sizeiveness it was really rather indecisive according to the same core commander he quote had a tendency to ask your advice and having received it acted in the opposite way here's another one richie is not sufficiently quick-witted or imaginative another one a fine robust looking man with charm and manner but no aura and finally confident and decisive in his speech but one did not always feel he was quite so confident and decisive in his mind that's another thing I talked about that I think of the first one there's act that you learn you learn to kind of raise your voice a little bit you learn to project you learn to fero your eyebrows a little bit and you say hey listen Burke I love doing that right because it's something that we experience so much in the military listen up oh sorry who through some weakness of intellect or lack of moral fiber could not be trusted with information held by their elders and better's meaning the military's like you don't really know what's going on here you need to worry about that the guardians of Singapore were prime exemplars of this motivation after a long history of wrong thinking they could not afford to be found mistaken the more events prove them to be wrong the stronger their defenses became against admitting this to be the case and this is very important as Hitler's administration demonstrated in its darkest form man this is important suppression of the truth involves two procedures on the one hand censorship and on the other hand official communicates the high command and Singapore employed both measures take the order of the day released to the melee tribune a bear two months before Singapore capitulated it reads we are ready we have had plenty of warning and our preparations are made and tested we are confident our defenses are strong and our weapons efficient whatever our race we have one aim and one only it is to defend these shores to destroy such of our enemies as may set foot on our soil what of our enemy we have seen before us Japan drained for years by exhausting claims of our want non-slot of China let us all remember that we here in the far-reast form part of the great campaign in the world of truth and justice and freedom as the editor of the tribune said it was hard to believe that anybody could deliberately tell some any lies on Monday the 18th 1941 general headquarters issued its first war communicate it stated that the Japanese had failed in their attempt to land at Kotabaru this was followed shortly after by a second communicator which stated all surface craft are retiring at high speed and the few troops left on the beach are being heavily machine gun. what are you shaking your head at day just not wait for you come out i'm just freaking it's rad um super stoked on it and looking forward to that coming out then everything else you know leadership strategy in tactics code evaluation protocol discipline because freedom field manual way the warrior kid one two three and four mic in the dragons about face by hack worth extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership echelom front is our leadership consultancy we saw problems through leadership that's what we do leadership is the solution go to echelom front dot com if you want details on that we have live events we also have an online training academy because leadership isn't something you learn in one shot it's something you have to work on just like going to the gym just like jiu jitsu so either's a bunch of courses on there you can take there's live sessions that we're doing two three times a week where if you want to ask me a question you can ask me one last day of a question you can ask Dave go to extremownership dot com if you want to get involved in that and also if you want to help service members active and retired you want to help their families go to our family check out mark least and I was like not an open any of these things it's not waterproof but you can see that's the kind of test where someone goes hey put it in a plastic bag and then say it's waterproof you know you got some contractor that's going to sell all these GPS's to to naval special warfare not on my freaking watch you're not this shit is a joke well the quilt any potential concern just that scenario of like that word that pre-wold or two you know battleship airplane British thing where it was just like hey I'm gonna come I'm kind of scared to get out I'll be there go just stay in here go begin to paycheck three hats in a cot you know I get the uniform people's treat me with respect I'm good back to the book to understand the psychology of these reactionary elements in the military establishment of men who choose to make the army their career painstakingly work their way up the hierarchy to the highest positions but then behave in such a manner to ensure that if they are remembered and all will be only for their conservatism we needs must have recourse to ego psychology thus it seems in that in the present instance military leaders like devil Montgomery, millen iron side and gork displayed behavior symptomatic of extremely weak egos in this light their behavior typifies the neurotic paradox in which the individuals need to be loved breeds on the one hand an insatiable desire for admiration with avoidance of criticism and on the other hand and equally devouring urge for power and positions of dominance that's weird the paradox is that these needs inevitably result in behavior so unrealistic as to earn for the victim the very criticism which he has been striving so hard to avoid consider a few concrete examples of this syndrome for those who had disappeared of anyone ever learning anything from the events of the first world war 1933 bought brought a belated gleam of hope with the publication of the Kirk Committee report which was not uncritical of the high command it could hardly have been otherwise but there were those for whom preservation of personal reputations counted for more than the need to avoid the repetition of senseless slaughter to which their direction had given rise this is this is evil
