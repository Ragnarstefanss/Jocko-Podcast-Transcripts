00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000 This is Jocco podcast number 23 with Echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000 Good evening Echo.
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000 Good evening.
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000 Better.
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000 And faster and stronger and smarter and wiser.
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000 Always trying to get a little bit of all those things.
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000 And we try and get wiser.
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000 That's one of those things.
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000 That's wisdom, which technically wisdom comes from experience.
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000 So how do you garner experience?
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000 You can't just make yourself live longer in a shorter period of time.
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000 It doesn't work that way.
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000 So what do we do to garner wisdom?
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000 We look to the past.
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000 You got to know your past.
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000 You got to know history.
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000 And as I tell my son on a pretty regular basis,
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000 history revolves around war.
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000 And in many ways history is war.
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000 And war is a human endeavor.
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000 The worst of human endeavors, but it is a human endeavor nonetheless.
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000 And because it is a human endeavor,
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000 therefore reflects human nature.
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000 And that's why we can learn so much from the history of war.
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000 Not just about war itself.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000 But about man.
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000 And about human nature.
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000 And the same goes for principles of war.
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000 The principles of war can be applied to life.
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000 Can be applied to business.
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000 Can be applied to relationships.
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000 Can be applied to every human endeavor.
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000 And so with that in mind, that full spectrum of application.
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000 Let's take a look at the oldest book about the principles of war.
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000 Written in 500 BC over 2,500 years ago.
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000 A book whose principles still apply today.
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000 Sunsoes, the art of war.
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000 Sunsoes said,
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000 the art of war is a vital importance to the state.
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000 It is a matter of life and death.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000 A road either to safety or to ruin.
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000 Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can, on no account, be neglected.
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000 You got to study war.
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000 And like I said, it is really about life in conflict, in friction, in relationships.
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000 And human interaction, you're going to see all that.
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000 When you start looking at the art of war.
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000 And he starts talking about trying to figure out who's going to win in a situation.
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:56.000 When seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison in this wise.
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000 Which of the two generals has most ability?
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000 On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000 Which army is stronger?
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000 On which side are officers and men most highly trained?
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:23.000 In which army is their greater constancy in both reward and punishment?
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000 That's something you talked about.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000 Echo Charles and we're talking about kids.
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000 You've talked about how it's important for the punishment to be constant and consistent.
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000 Now yes, now what's interesting here.
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000 And this is something we've talked about before.
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000 And you know what I'm going to say that a lot today.
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000 This is something we've talked about before.
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000 Because when you start talking about military strategy, it runs through the ages.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000 There's threads that run through the ages.
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000 This is one of them.
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000 He says, while heating the profit of my council,
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:07.000 avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000 According as circumstances are favorable, one you should modify one's plans.
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000 So don't get dead set on something.
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000 Don't get locked into a plan.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000 You gotta be open to change it.
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000 Continuing, all warfare is based on deception.
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000 Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable.
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000 When using our forces, we must seem inactive.
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000 When we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are away.
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000 When far away, we must make and believe we are near.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000 Hold out baits to entice the enemy,
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000 fain disorder and crush him.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000 Now this is something that applies absolutely directly to Jiu Jitsu, obviously.
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000 You know, oh, oh, you think you're going to get my arm?
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000 Boom, I just swept you and got on top.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000 Oh, I'm really panicking this situation.
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000 Oh, guess what?
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000 I just got a deep half guard came out the back and now I'm going to choke you.
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000 Back to the book.
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000 If he is secured, all points be prepared for him.
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000 If he is superior in strength, evade him.
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000 If your opponent is of caleric temper, seek to irritate him.
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000 Pretend to be weak that he may grow arrogant.
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000 So this is something people don't think about.
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000 In fact, that hey, if your opponent has superior strength, evade him.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000 And obviously, that's something that we also heard from Mal.
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000 The same, that was the same guerilla strategy.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000 If your opponent is strong, you avoid him.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000 And here we say, if they're losing their temper a little bit, go ahead and irritate him.
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000 Help that long.
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000 Pretend to be weak so that your opponent grows arrogant.
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000 And thinks there's enough to worry about you.
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000 Continuing, if he is taking his ease, give him no rest.
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000 If his forces are united, separate them, attack him where he's unprepared.
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000 A peer where you are not expected.
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000 These military devices leading to victory must not be divulged beforehand.
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000 It's strange that this is the oldest book, and this thread runs throughout history.
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000 And yet, people interacting with each other will constantly decide they're just going to go, you know, toe to toe.
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000 You're going to argue with me, cool, I'm just going to go toe to toe with you.
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000 Yeah, this is an intellectual approach.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000 And I think that's, you know, if you're not detached, it's harder to jump on that intellectual methodology.
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000 Yes, with you, if you come at me, with your argument head on or you accuse me,
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000 or you're trying to tighten me up on something, you're just being super direct with me.
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000 It's your right.
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000 I might get offended in the way I'm going to do, I'm going to go right back at you.
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000 Right.
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000 Instead of maneuvering on you.
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000 Right.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000 So like, if someone's super smart or super calculated, they're way more likely to sign onto this type of stuff.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000 So as you start losing your temper with someone, think about what echo Charles just said,
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000 that means you're not being very smart, you're not being very calculated.
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000 It means you're making a mistake. You know, means there's a better route to go.
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000 Yep.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000 Now, continuing.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000 Now, the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple, air the battle is fought.
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000 The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000 So you got a plan.
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000 And it's, it's interesting, you use the word calculate, calculate of,
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000 and he just used the same word.
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000 Now, this is something that I've talked about.
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000 To fight in conquer and all your battles is not supreme excellence.
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:18.000 I'll say that again, to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence.
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.000 Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000 And I always take that one step further. I always take it to the point that the enemy doesn't even know that there was a fight.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000 They didn't even know what was happening. They thought they were having dinner and going to sleep, but they just got beat.
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000 And that's especially true when you're part of a team and you're trying to win some,
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000 you're trying to push your idea through, you're trying to convince people of something.
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000 The best way to convince them is when you didn't go that toe to toe with them,
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000 they came to the conclusion themselves, at least they think they did.
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000 You fought them without fighting them.
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000 Thus, the highest form of general ship is to block the enemy's plans.
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000 The next best is to prevent the junction of enemy forces.
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000 The next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field.
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000 And the worst policy of all is to besieged walled cities.
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000 The rule is not to besiege wall cities if it can possibly be avoided.
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000 Now, this is another thing.
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:40.000 And I've said this on this podcast before, which is, if someone is super dug in on a position, why are you going to attack him?
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000 If you have this belief that you're just dug in on, and I'm trying to maneuver around it,
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000 why am I going to attack that position? You've got, you know more about it, you've studied it.
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000 You've been in this argument 47 times in the last three weeks.
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000 So, how am I going to come up against you? And you've got that well for the five position.
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000 Yeah, the answer is I'm not. It's not going to work out good for me.
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000 Therefore, the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting.
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:18.000 He captures their cities without laying any siege. He overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000 That's the goal.
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000 That is the goal.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000 And that is something else about martial arts.
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000 I think, like, when you get someone that really knows how to fight, most of the time you don't have to fight.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000 Yeah.
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000 Most of the time, you can tell people can tell that you know how to fight.
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000 Like, for instance, when they get in your face and you smile at him and you go, oh, let's do this.
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000 Then they realize this is not a good idea.
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000 Yeah.
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000 A little projection of power.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000 Going on here.
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000 Thus, we may know that there are five essentials for victory.
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:06.000 He will win, who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000 This is sort of like when you're doing Napoleon and just about everything in the book.
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000 You can just stop and think about it.
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000 And it's also sort of like, you're jutsu in that what you've learned.
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000 Once you hear it, it seems super obvious, but why aren't you thinking about all the time?
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000 Right.
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000 And why do you make stupid mistakes that portray that rule?
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000 Because it's not front of your mind.
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000 Right.
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000 Yeah.
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000 Like I said, the two, when you're emotionally charged, it's just handle things way different.
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000 Which kind of ironic in a way, because that's what makes this so effective when people normally handle
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000 themselves in that emotional way.
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000 Yes.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000 And that's what if you're yourself in this way, that's the very thing that makes it effective.
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000 Yeah.
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000 And that's what I'm saying, theme to this.
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000 Which hasn't been said.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:05.000 I mean, he doesn't address this the way I dressed it the way I talk about it in our book, the way we talk about the podcast is the idea that you're talking about, which is the idea of detaching and not being emotional.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000 So that you can do things.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000 So that you can make good decisions.
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000 Yeah.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000 Next, he will win, who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:26.000 He will win, whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all ranks.
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000 So if you're in a leadership position, you got part of your team on board with the program, not good enough.
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000 You got to get the whole team on board with the program.
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000 That's who's going to win.
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000 He will win, who prepared himself, prepared himself, weights to take the enemy unrepared.
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000 I'm just going to wait until you're not ready.
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000 Why would I square up?
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000 You know, why would I do that?
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000 If you're ready to fight me, we're not going to go.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000 Let's just wait till you're not expecting it.
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000 Yeah.
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:13.000 Along with any emotional kind of state that some people are in where they don't exercise these types of strategies along with the emotional state is the ego-tistical state.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000 You know, the guy was like, hey, I'm just going to stand till it till.
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000 You're like, all right, that's tough.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000 That might make for a show and fighting MMA situation.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000 But as far as the strategy to win, that's again.
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000 It's cool for the show, but there's winning actually winning.
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000 It might not be the best.
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000 We'll just say that.
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000 Yeah, I would agree with you.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:49.000 Number five, he will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000 Victory lies in the knowledge of those five points.
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000 So that means you can't get micromanaged.
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000 If you're being micromanaged by the higher powers, you're going to have problems.
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000 And here's the classic saying that everyone's heard.
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.000 Hence the saying, if you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000 If you know yourself, but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you are off also suffer a defeat.
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:34.000 If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000 So you've got to know yourself.
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000 That's your team.
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000 That's you.
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000 That's why you've got to learn.
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000 That's why you've got to study.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000 That's why you've got to train.
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000 That's why you've got to test yourself too.
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000 That's why you've got to put pressure on yourself.
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000 Because you don't know yourself unless you put yourself into situations.
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000 Physically, mentally, stress.
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000 That's what you want to go into.
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000 So that you know yourself.
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000 When we use to send COP, when we send COP, it turns over.
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000 They know what their limitations are.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000 They've been tested hard individually and as a unit.
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000 Going on.
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000 Sunsu said, and this is actually, that's a quote from the book.
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000 So I guess he must have wrote that because this is allegedly a literal translation of Sunsu.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000 And so he starts off his statements with Sunsu said.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000 The good fighters of old put first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat.
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000 And then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000 To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands.
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000 But the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000 So he's going to talk about that more and it is laced throughout this book.
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000 That you've got to focus on your game.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000 You've got to focus on what you can do in the situation.
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000 Not worried about them, but like what can I do to be prepared?
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000 Hmm.
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000 Put myself beyond the possibility of defeat.
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:15.000 Hence, the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy.
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000 Going on.
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000 Sunsu said,
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000 The control of a large force is the same in principle as the control of a few men.
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000 It is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000 Now when I wrote about that and late for night talk about that all the time,
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000 That's decentralized command.
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:51.000 Dividing up the numbers and having subordinate leadership running the teams and having subordinate leadership inside those teams running smaller teams.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000 That's all it is.
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000 The principle of control is the same.
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000 Now we get into a little bit of direct versus indirect.
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000 Again, a topic that I talk about all the time.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000 In all fighting the direct method may be used for joining battle,
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000 But indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000 Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible as heaven and earth,
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000 Unending as the flow of rivers and streams, like the sun and moon, they end but to begin a new.
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000 Like the four seasons, they pass but to return once more.
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000 So he's talking about how when you get to indirect tactics, they're infinite numbers.
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000 Infinite numbers of ways to approach things.
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000 There are not more than five musical notes.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000 Yet the combination of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000 There are not more than five primary colors, yet in combination they produce more cues than can ever be seen.
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:09.000 There are not more than five cardinal tastes, yet combinations of them yield flavors, more flavors than can ever be tasted.
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000 In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack, the direct and indirect.
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000 Yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000 The direct and indirect lead onto each other in turn.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000 It is like a moving circle, you never come to an end.
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000 Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000 He went a little, he went descriptive right there.
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000 He was obviously convinced as I am too.
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000 That even though there's basic maneuvers, the way that you apply them is limitless.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000 That's one of the things that makes leadership hard.
00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000 Because when you're dealing with people, there's a certain number of types of personalities you got to deal with.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:10.000 But then those personalities are all mixed together in a way that you have to react to them and treat them a certain way.
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000 They're the same.
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000 Yeah, and then you have to deal with how they interact with each other as well.
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000 And then not to mention the fact that they may or may not change as individuals, as the day goes on.
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000 As the day goes on, they start getting hungry, they start getting angry.
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000 Right?
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000 Or maybe they just watch the romantic comedy and they're feeling a little different.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000 Well, that's hope that's not the case.
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000 Whatever.
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000 I don't know why I said romantic comedy.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:46.000 All right, back to Sunsu. Sunsu said, whoever is in the first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy will be fresh for the fight.
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000 Whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to the battle will arrive exhausted.
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000 Therefore, the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy.
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000 But does not allow the enemies will to be imposed on him.
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000 Here, that all the time in MMA, who's going to impose their will on this fight?
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000 Hmm.
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000 By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach his own accord.
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000 That's bait.
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000 Right.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000 Or by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near.
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000 Hmm.
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000 If the enemy is taking his ease, meaning if the enemy is trying to rest, he can harass him.
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000 If well supplied, he can starve him out.
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000 If quietly in camp, he can force him to move.
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000 So all these are just little things to basically annoy the enemy.
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000 Throw him off his game, throw him off of his game.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000 Up here, at points, which the enemy must hasten to defend.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000 March swiftly to places where you are not expected.
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000 And army may march great distances without distress if he marches through country where the enemy is not.
00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000 You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you attack places,
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000 which are not defended.
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000 Totally obvious.
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000 Right.
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000 You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you attack places, which are not defended.
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000 And this is something that we do in Gigiitsu.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000 You know, you're attacking the neck, you're attacking the neck, they're protecting the neck, they're protecting the neck, boom arm.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000 Or you're going for a community, you're going for a community, boom straight arm lock, other arm.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000 Yeah.
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:32.000 Big one is when you fake a submission to go for a guard pass or something that's not a submission, you know?
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000 Because it throws your mind off, like Greg does that really well, where he'll go for that guitine.
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000 And you're like, oh, he's going for a submission.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000 So your mind is one thing to be like, okay, I see he's going for my neck and then get my arm could be exposed.
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000 That's one thing because you're thinking, okay, this submission to this next submission.
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.000 But if it's, you know, if they're going for something completely different, different aspect of the game, it throws your feet in more.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000 He's got me with that, like three times in a row before.
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000 Yeah, that's basically going even further to the flank.
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000 Yeah.
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000 Getting some, you know, you're expecting this somebody to shoot you with a machine gun, they start lobbing mortars at you.
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000 Yeah.
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000 You weren't ready for that at all.
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000 Or they start taking your guy's hostage, it didn't even let that through the back door or something like that, you know?
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000 Completely different.
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000 Yeah.
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000 You can ensure the safety of your defense if you hold only positions that cannot be attacked.
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000 How obvious is that?
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000 Yeah.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000 Let's just get in positions where we can't be attacked and then we will defend them very easily.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000 The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known.
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000 For then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points.
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:55.000 And his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionally few.
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000 So you don't want to let the enemy know where you're going to attack him because then he can defend that specific area.
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000 Whereas if he has to defend all of the areas, he's got less people defending where you're going to attack.
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000 We didn't really well in World War II, the D-Day.
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000 You know, the Germans did not know they were suspect where we were going to attack but they didn't know it was Normandy.
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000 So they had a lot of defenses, strewn about another area's.
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000 And they cost all.
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000 Now here we go with how we deal with what the enemy does.
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000 For should the enemy strengthen his van, which van is like the division at the front.
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000 It's the front of your troops, van.
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000 That's why they like to term van guard.
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000 Is that your front front guard?
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000 For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear.
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000 Should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van.
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000 Should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right, should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left.
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000 If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000 Week.
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000 And that's what you know again going to Jiu Jitsu when someone is when you feel impassing and they're blocking you.
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000 And they're thinking about a knee lock and you get all those things going on at the same time.
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000 And you're just trying to spread your defenses then.
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000 Then when they do one of those three, you're in trouble.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000 And I always explain to people, you know, when you, it's easy.
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000 It's pretty easy for anybody.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000 If you tell me, I'm going to try and straighten out your arm and that's my whole focus is to stop you for straight in my arm.
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000 It's, you know, I can do it.
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000 I can do it pretty well.
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000 I'm well defended on that area.
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000 There's no opening somewhere else.
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000 Right?
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000 And the same thing with guard passing.
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000 If I'm trying to pass your guard all tight.
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000 Low and heavy.
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000 And you're just defending defending defending.
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000 That means there's opening somewhere else probably far away from you.
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000 Yeah.
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000 Super common with guard passing is, you know, you smash to the, you know, one side right your smashing smashing to one side.
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000 And then you hop your hips over the other side.
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000 That's why it opened all the time.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000 And the hearty you smash.
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000 The more wide open that far side is.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000 Yeah, that's a common one.
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000 Yeah, it's just a distraction.
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000 Yeah.
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000 And then a flank.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000 Mm-hmm.
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000 Sun soon has been doing it for 2500 years.
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000 Dang.
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000 All right.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000 Do not repeat the tactics which you have gained.
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000 Your on victory.
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000 Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory.
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000 But let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000 Military tactics are like unto water.
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000 For water in its natural course runs away from high places.
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000 And a hastens downward.
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000 So in war, the way to avoid what is strong is to strike what is weak.
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000 Now, this is something that we definitely got raised with in the sealed things.
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000 You don't use the same methodology over and over and over again and develop pattern.
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000 You don't do it.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000 No matter how minor you change things up, you change things up.
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000 Mm-hmm.
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000 And that's something that any good military unit does.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000 It's something that anybody that's being able to do.
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000 That's being threatened.
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000 You know, if your life is in danger, you don't set a pattern on what you do.
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000 You change it up.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000 Water shapes it's course according to the ground over which it flows.
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000 The soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:35.000 Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare, there are no constant conditions.
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000 You got to have an open mind.
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000 You can't get trapped inside your own tactics.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000 You can't get trapped inside your own game.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000 And I see this with businesses we work with.
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000 We've companies that we work with where they have got their thing that they've done and they've been successful for six years run.
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000 And then all of a sudden something changes.
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000 And they're trying to run the same methodology without ever stepping back and saying,
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000 Wait a second, we did well.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000 We had a 12% growth average for the past six years.
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000 And all of a sudden we're down 22%.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000 What happened?
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000 Well, let's just do what we did before again.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000 And again, that's what that's what how people spiral into bankruptcy.
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000 Well, because the conditions, the decisions come in change.
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000 But conditions change.
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000 And they don't look and say, oh, the enemy adapted.
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000 The competitors adapted.
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.000 You know, we can look at some of these businesses that have gone on in the music industry has changed dramatically.
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000 CDs.
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000 I mean, imagine if you own a CD production warehouse somewhere.
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000 I mean, you would have written CDs.
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000 Yeah, it's our records classic example.
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000 Yeah.
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000 And back to that, doing the same thing over and over again.
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000 Like, if you succeed with this one method, it's like sales people.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000 You know, sales people, they really look a lot of them.
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000 And they really look at sales as this kind of war.
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000 You know, it's me again.
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000 Someone makes the sale either you sell them your product or they sell you way to come by, whatever.
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000 When you see as a consumer, when you see the sale, especially from sales people directly,
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:20.000 when you see the same language over and over after all, you're like, I see exactly what you're doing.
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000 See what you're doing.
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000 You know how they ask you.
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000 They'll ask you a question that if you say no to you look dumb or something like that, you know, so it's, I don't know if they're going to say yes 15 times a row.
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000 Yeah, there'd be like, oh, obviously, right.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000 And you're like, I can't, you kind of feel like you can't say no.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000 But after all, you're like, I see what you're doing.
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000 So it may work because then they probably teach them that.
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000 You know, so it's like, oh, yeah, that works.
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000 That works.
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000 But yeah, I want to start getting hip to it.
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000 Stuff won't work anymore.
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000 Not, it's definitely not going to work on that.
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000 Go Charles.
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000 No, no, no, no.
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000 I see what you're doing.
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000 I see what you guys are doing.
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000 All right.
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000 And this is just restating the same thing.
00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000 He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning.
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000 Maybe called a heaven-born captain.
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000 So if you can look at what your opponent's doing, and this is something that, again,
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000 I see companies do it.
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000 I see jujitsu players do it.
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000 They have that one thing that they're used to.
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000 And then someone's really good at defending that one thing.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000 And they just keep going against it, keep going against it.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000 Keep running into that brick wall.
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000 And it's not going to get you where you want to be.
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000 Yeah, it's problematic.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000 Here we go.
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000 From Sunsu, a soldier spirit is keenest in the morning.
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000 By noon day, it has begun to flag.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000 And in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000 A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when it's spirit is keen.
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000 But attacks when it is sluggish and inclined to return.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000 This is the art of studying moods.
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000 Yeah, like that.
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000 The art of studying moods is about knowing people.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000 Yeah, is that kind of like the guy in jujitsu class?
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000 He shows up like 15 minutes before the class ends when everyone's been rolling.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000 He's getting everyone there and sluggish.
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000 Yeah, when they're ready to turn me.
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000 Go back to camp.
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000 Like, hey, guys, want to roll off for ash.
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000 It is a military axiom, not to advance uphill against the enemy.
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000 Nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000 Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight.
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000 Do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000 Do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy.
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000 Do not interfere with an army that's returning home.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000 That's a good one.
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000 They're going, they're running, let them run, let them go home.
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000 They're going to fight hard to get home, right?
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000 They got visions of their family and their head.
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000 When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000 Do not press a desperate foe too hard.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000 And this is something you see psychologically a lot.
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000 You know, with an argument, you got a couple executives.
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000 And maybe the senior executive has a plan and no one likes the plan.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000 Well, you just don't want to box him in and prove him wrong in front of everybody.
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000 Right?
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000 You don't want to do that.
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000 You want to be crafty.
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000 You want to get your son sued together.
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000 You want to leave him a little opening.
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000 Where he can say, you know what?
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000 After reconsidering, I've decided I want to go with this other way because I figured out that blah blah blah.
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000 Yeah.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000 And I'm giving him an out.
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.000 What you don't want to do is make him stick to this bad plan because his ego is making him stick there.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000 Yeah.
00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.000 Recognize.
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000 Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000 When you're doing your jutsu, don't when someone gets across side, you scramble.
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000 You go crazy.
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000 Don't let him settle there.
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000 When somebody's trying to get that, call the geek all the way up underneath your head and they're going to have you trapped.
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000 Don't let him get there.
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000 Don't linger in dangerously isolated positions.
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000 Move.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000 Yeah.
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000 It's it gets so complex with this and in jutsu where it's just, just get considered just what you said.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000 Because this kind of, it kind of overflows into another part that he just talked about.
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000 So let's say the example of the guy passing your guard into your side control.
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000 During his past, you said don't let him settle.
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000 Exactly.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000 So, but when he, let's say whatever you lose the fight for whatever reason, any does settle.
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.000 Now you're faced with a situation where if he's settled on you hard, where he's, you can tell he's putting strength into holding that position.
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000 And then you try to scramble.
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000 Oh, you're going against, you're going full speed, you know, toe to toe.
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000 Like I always said not to do.
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000 So at that point, you got to change your strategy.
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000 If you had had already lost that battle, you and he settled and he's putting his energy into holding you.
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000 Now you got to play another tactic that he said, let him, you know, you got to relax a little bit.
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000 So he starts relaxing a little bit.
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000 You know what, that's like that's a common thing.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000 That's like, you know, a pretty well known strategy I would say when you get advanced in GJ2.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000 But it's crazy how he just lays it out and that's the perfect exact exact example.
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000 Yeah.
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000 But all in one little, one little move.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000 One little movement.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:48.000 And actually he continues on that same, on that same thread in himden situations.
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000 In other words, when you're surrounded and you're under the bad situation, you must resort to strategy.
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000 And strategy doesn't really mean strategy.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000 It means like tricks, more than exceptions.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000 So you've, you've given up, you've given up your position.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000 The person is dominating you now.
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000 And exactly what you're saying is correct.
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.000 When someone has got you in that position, either in an argument or a plan or a situation that you're in or a relationship,
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000 they've got you locked down, stop fighting.
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000 You know, it's not going to work.
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000 You're, they've got you.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000 If you continue to struggle, you're just going to wear yourself out.
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000 You're going to worsen this scenario.
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000 Stop.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000 And now you have to start thinking about a trick to get out of there.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000 Some kind of a better tactic, some kind of a deception.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000 Something to get you out of there.
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000 Because going strength, the strength is going to do it.
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000 They're in a superior position.
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000 You know, sometimes you can tell someone's doing that.
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000 If you have them in a situation and they start actually using this tactic,
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:57.000 little trick, a little trick, one that I've been able to recognize is they do like some ad hominom luck in argument.
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000 They'll start attacking something else.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000 Oh, yeah.
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000 Yeah, of course.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000 But it's, yeah, if you kind of have a handle on the whole situation, it's real obvious.
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000 Yeah.
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000 Yeah.
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000 And then he says, in a desperate position, you must fight.
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000 Now the difference here is now there's a submission hold on you.
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000 Yeah, no choice.
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000 Yeah, you have to fight with your finger fighter going to tap.
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000 Yeah.
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000 So you get that situation where it's gone beyond just their secure and they've got unit dominant position.
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000 But now they're actually going to kill you.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000 You have no choice but to fight the last level of settling.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000 Now this is interesting.
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000 There are roads which must not be followed.
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000 Armies which must not be attacked.
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000 Towns which must not be besieged.
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000 Positions which must not be contested.
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000 Commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000 Hmm.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000 So it's always interesting to me when you hear somebody that's a military mastermind.
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:07.000 And they're saying that there are orders from their sovereign that must not be obeyed.
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000 And I think we've heard that.
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000 And this is something that people don't familiar with the military or not familiar with military history.
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000 They think everyone just follows orders, follows orders, follows orders.
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.000 But Napoleon we've heard said, Sunsu we've heard said, we've heard these repeated things where people say,
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000 You know what?
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000 That's the wrong order.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000 And I'm not going to do it.
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000 Hmm.
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000 And it's interesting too.
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000 The other dichotomy is all these people talk about the necessity of discipline.
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000 And inherent in discipline is absolutely the following of orders.
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000 But as much as stringent as I am about discipline,
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000 Hmm.
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000 If I'm I want my guys to question my words.
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000 Hmm.
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000 I want them to say, hey wait a second why is Jockel making us do this?
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000 He's he's wrong.
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000 I don't want them to still bang me blindly.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000 Hmm.
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000 Because you don't want your team obeying you blindly.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000 You don't want that.
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000 You want them to be thinking.
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000 Back to the book.
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000 The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemies not coming,
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000 but on our own readiness to receive him.
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000 Not on the chance of his not attacking,
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000 but rather on the fact that we have made our position on the salibal.
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000 So what that is again, he's putting the the preponderance of the outcome,
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000 not on what the enemy does, but on what you do.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000 It's not what happens, it's not what happens to you in your life.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000 It's what you do, it's what you prepare for.
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000 Hmm.
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000 It's your own readiness that's going to affect the outcome.
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000 Not the chance of what the enemy is done, done.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000 It's how have you made your position.
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000 Hmm.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000 How have you set yourself up?
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000 How have you prepared?
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000 How have you trained?
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000 How have you worked?
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000 That's where the outcome comes from.
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000 Not what the world does to you, but what you do to the world.
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000 Hmm.
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000 There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general.
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000 One recklessness which leads to destruction.
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000 Two cowardice which leads to capture.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000 So those two, you got one guy that's a maniac that doesn't care,
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000 he's going to go get after it, he's going to die.
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000 You got someone else that's a coward, he's going to get captured.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000 Hmm.
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000 Three, a hasty temper that can be provoked by insults.
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000 Dangerous.
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000 A delicacy of honor that is sensitive to shame.
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000 Sort of the same thing.
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000 And an over-solicitude for his men which exposes him to worry and trouble.
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000 An over-solicitude that's basically you over-efectionate.
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:04.000 Care about the men so much that exposes you to worry and trouble.
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000 These are the five-bassetting sins of a general.
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000 Ruiness to the conquer.
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000 Ruiness to the conduct of war.
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000 Some things to watch out for and it's interesting, you know, obviously the one that's.
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000 That's.
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000 I guess the most controversial to me is that over-solicitude for his men,
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000 which exposes him to worry and trouble.
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000 Because, you know, in the modern military, you know, he was dealing with conscripts.
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000 So even, it's interesting, even conscripts back then he said,
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000 you could get to affectionate with your conscripts.
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000 And now we have brothers.
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000 And so you're gonna care about your guys.
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000 You're gonna care about your guys more than anything else in the world.
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000 But what you have to counter that with is not, hey, I'm not gonna care about them.
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000 No, it's I'm gonna make sure I do everything I can to keep them safe.
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000 Yeah, yeah, I think, like, you know,
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000 a lot of companies they discourage, fraturizing with, you know, your co-workers.
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000 So I saw work in the nightclub industry where, you know, from time to time,
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000 people would hook up.
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000 So what that can result in is, you know,
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000 people who are too focused on the relationship between each other versus their job.
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000 Oh, yeah.
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000 So, I'm, this is a total assumption, but maybe that's what he's talking about.
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000 No, that's exactly what he's talking about.
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000 That's exactly what he's talking about.
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000 And, but if you take that into the military scenario,
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000 it's, you know, like I said, you're gonna care about your guys so much.
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000 And you have to counter that with the fact that you have a duty.
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000 Right.
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000 And you have, you have a job.
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000 Yeah.
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000 And that everybody on your team, like we're in the civil teams, you all know the risk.
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000 Yeah.
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000 Everybody knows the risk.
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000 Everybody knows that when you go on an operation, it might be your last operation.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000 You get hit with an ID, you get shot, you get mortar, you get blown up.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000 I mean, everybody accepts that risk.
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000 Yeah.
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000 And that, therefore, as a leader, you know, you're not imposing that risk upon them.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000 They volunteered for that risk.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000 And I think that's what allows a modern military commander to, to say,
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000 hey, I love these guys, but they all know what they signed up for.
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000 There's gonna be risk here.
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000 And we got a job to do.
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000 As opposed to, hey, I love these guys.
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000 They don't want to be here.
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000 And I'm gonna send them to their deaths.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000 That would not, that would be a different scenario, a harder scenario.
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000 Yeah.
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000 Or you got close.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000 Let's say, you know, you're in command of, you know, 10 guys.
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000 Five of those guys are your best friends.
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000 And you get to attached in the sense that you have a mission that you have to do.
00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000 A dangerous one.
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000 But you're like, hey, I'm not gonna send those five guys because they're gonna be at risk.
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000 I want to keep them safe.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000 You know, so I don't want to send them there.
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000 See, the other five guys go rather than the 10 and, you know, messes up your whole job.
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.000 Yeah.
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000 Your whole job.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000 Which, oddly enough, I will always send like the guys I love.
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000 It's great.
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000 Worst scenario.
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.000 Yeah.
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000 All my brothers, they would be lining up and saying, I'm going.
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000 And I'm going.
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.000 Yeah.
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000 It's fired up.
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000 See, yeah.
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000 I mean, you're obviously a very specific type of person.
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:29.000 Yeah.
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000 And your guys probably are too.
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000 I would imagine.
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:42.000 But still, you're still exercising that discipline between, you know, them potentially going to their death.
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000 And that job you guys have to do.
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000 So you're thinking of it in a smarter way.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000 And it's interesting.
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000 I just thought of this like, if a guy got in trouble for whatever reason when we were over on deployment,
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000 whenever I was on deployment and combat, if a guy got in trouble, you know what their punishment would be?
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000 You're not allowed to go on a mission.
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000 I know. So that just tells you what kind of an attitude, you know, the guys that we're working with.
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000 Yeah.
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000 Is that, oh, you can't go on these next three missions.
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000 Yeah.
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000 Guys are angry.
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000 Yeah.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000 And they're hurt because they realize they're letting their buddies down.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000 You know, if something goes wrong and they're not there, it's a nightmare.
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000 Yeah. And they're, they're, they're duty, they're job is, it's part of them, you know, where I,
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000 I was listening to this thing where he's talking about this, the omnisch, omnisch people, right?
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000 And they're really into work, you know, hard work and stuff.
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000 One of the punishments for the kids would be, you're not allowed to work.
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000 Yeah. That's the same as the same thing.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000 It's like saying it's like there.
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000 Yeah. Same thing.
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000 Yeah.
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000 Meanwhile, my kids, I got to beat them senseless to get them do any work.
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000 Just kidding.
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000 Just kidding.
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000 But I guarantee they're not working as hard as some omnisch kid out of field.
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:49.000 Yeah.
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000 I'm putting up buildings with the wood nails that they do.
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000 Yeah.
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000 That's awesome.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.000 Yeah.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000 Yeah. The work is obviously part of their identity.
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000 Yeah.
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000 You know, so like, you know, it's certain things people, let's say, quote,
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000 I'm quote, normal people might find like exercise, for example.
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000 Like if so, if let's say you're just an average person who's like, man, I got to,
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000 I'm going to make a new just resolution.
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000 I'm going to lose some weight or whatever.
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000 I'm going to get a trainer and it's hard for them.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000 It's work for them.
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000 Right. So the trainer is like, hey, today's rest day.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000 They're going to, oh, sweet.
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000 You know, but then you take you for example, like how you're saying,
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000 your wife is like, hey, maybe don't go to Jiu Jitsu today.
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000 You're all pissed.
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000 Yeah.
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000 You know, so it's the exact opposite.
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000 But so that's kind of the scenario when it's ingrained in you and it's starting to
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000 become part of your identity.
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000 Work or not work, you want to get that done.
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000 Yeah.
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000 That's interesting.
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000 How those those embedded feelings, you know, develop in your life.
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000 But what an awesome deal.
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000 Like if you think about that, we would actually, if we had to punish our guys,
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000 we'd punish them by saying you can't go on two missions.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000 That's perfect.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000 Yeah, it'd be angry.
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000 They'd be bald.
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000 They'd be letting down.
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000 They'd like help everyone get ready and they'd stand there whenever it's leaving.
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000 And learn their lesson first.
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000 Pardon.
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000 Pardon.
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000 All right.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000 Next, when the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.000 strength of his position.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000 This is a good one.
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000 So when you're when you're when you're in GJ2, when someone, for instance, pulls
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000 guard real quick, you know, they've got a good guard.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000 Yeah.
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000 You know, when someone's like all standing up and all upright and reaching for your collar while
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000 you're standing, you know, they got some judo going on.
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000 So it's funny how when when people have a dominant position, they'll lean towards it.
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000 Yeah.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:53.000 If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000 So if it looks good to be true, it's too good to be true.
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000 You got to watch that.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:07.000 When there is much running about, it means that the critical moment has come.
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000 When some are seeing it advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:17.000 When soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:23.000 If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000 from thirst.
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:33.000 If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:40.000 If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000 If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak.
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000 If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is a foot.
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:59.000 When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, and when the men do not hang their cooking pots over the campfires,
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:08.000 showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:20.000 The sight of men whispering together in small knots and speaking in subdued tones points to dissatisfaction amongst the rank and file.
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000 Now, all those right there, what I would like about those, because some of them are a little bit archaic.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000 People are leaning on their spears.
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000 People not putting out their cooking pots.
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000 Those are things that we are going to see today.
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:41.000 But what's so key about this is how observing how people act can tell you much more if you are paying attention to it.
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:47.000 You see people talking amongst themselves and small groups, there is a problem going on.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000 Those are the kind of things that you are going to be aware of.
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000 Especially as a leader.
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.000 When you are in a leadership position and you see and you look and you watch and you listen.
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:05.000 Because actually some people, some leaders, they get isolated from the troops, they get isolated from the situation,
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000 they get isolated from the enemy, they are not reading what's happening.
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000 So you have to have this awareness and the sensitivity, right?
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000 It is a sensitivity, it is a sixth sense of a something is not right here.
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000 And what are you picking that up from?
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000 When you walk in a room, everyone is all talking or you see from a distance people are talking.
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000 And then when you either walk fire, you join them, they are happy to be done talking every single time.
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000 That's not going to be a good sign.
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000 They are talking about you.
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000 Back to the book.
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000 He exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000 It is sure to be captured by them.
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:57.000 So when you are saying, oh, we don't have enough in the fear here, we can take these guys, we can win that contract, we can beat the opponent, we can win.
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000 That's when you are going to be taken down.
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.000 If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive.
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000 And unless submissive, they will be practically useless.
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:19.000 If when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:29.000 Therefore, soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000 This is a certain road to victory.
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:42.000 If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well disciplined.
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:49.000 So now you do realize that Sun Siu 2,500 years ago was leading humans.
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000 And if you came out of the gate before they knew you and you treated them bad, they were never going to work for you.
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000 They were never going to submit to what you want to do.
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.000 And once they were attached to you, if you had punishments and now you had built enough respect, and then you said you were going to punish them for something that they did.
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000 You said a certain standard, and then you don't hold it, they're going to be equally useless.
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000 In consistent.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000 In consistent.
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000 Firmly believe it.
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:27.000 If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well disciplined.
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:34.000 You got to stay consistent, and you got to remember that you're dealing with humans.
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:43.000 When common soldiers are too strong, and their officers are too weak, the result is in subordination.
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:52.000 And this is something that I saw a couple times in my career, where I had a guy that worked for me, who was a tough guy.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.000 This happened a couple times, just a badass guy, super tough beast, hardcore, go getter.
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000 And when they worked for me, man, I loved him.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000 And they did anything.
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000 I would tell them to go, you know, run through a brick wall, they would start running.
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000 And they would run through the brick wall, they'd figured out, they'd get through that thing.
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000 Super hard.
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000 And then one guy, I like I went to another team, and he went on another deployment, and got sent home from deployment.
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000 Because he was just too much to handle.
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:29.000 And his subordinate, I talked to him about it, he goes, oh, my officers were weak.
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000 He literally said, my officers were weak.
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:40.000 And so here is like a cage to animal, that if you don't, if you just know who the boss is,
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000 and he doesn't respect the boss, he's not going to listen to you.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000 He was the alpha male, right?
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000 And when he was the alpha male, he was doing whatever he wanted, wasn't listening to these people that were in charge of him.
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000 Yeah, what is that?
00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:03.000 Like a mix of, like he doesn't, I don't want to look up to him, but there's a sense of that right where if your leader is just going to spend,
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:10.000 you have that kind of ingrained respect, and then not to mention on top of that, you don't fear any real consequences from him.
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000 You know, it's kind of weak.
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000 I can take whatever you can dish out kind of thing.
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000 So it's both of those.
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000 You think?
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000 Yeah, oh yeah.
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:27.000 Yeah, this one guy that this happened with, I taught him Gjitsu, and he was excited about it in a way that I've never seen anyone excited.
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:34.000 Like, super happy about knowing that you could choke people, and he would get into fights in the civilian world,
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000 and come and give me these full de-briefs and ask me for pointers and judgment,
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:49.000 and that was, you know, a warrior that liked to fight, and he found out that you could grab people and submit them.
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000 You were super excited about it.
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000 Yeah, like a little kid.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000 And I always say that that's kind of the risk you run with teaching people Gjitsu, because it is like,
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:06.000 I'm going to, it's a superpower, essentially, because you don't have to learn that much for it to be effective in this huge way.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000 So, you know, like, kind of like, what is it? Superman.
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000 With great power and comes great responsibility.
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000 Yeah.
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000 Yeah.
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.000 Goes on to say, when the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is collapse.
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:31.000 So when you put the super hardcore guy over that can't modulate his, his leadership, he can't back off and build people up before he starts to smash him.
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:39.000 You're going to get collapse and that's something you definitely got to look out for, especially if you're a super strong leader and you come and take over a team that's been led by somebody that's weak.
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000 There's a chance that the players in the team are weak.
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:48.000 And now you got to come in and build them up before you let loose your vicious leadership power, right?
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000 You can't just come in there with the iron fist and start dropping hammers.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000 No, you need to say, hey, guys, all right, let's go, let's build this team up.
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:03.000 And then you can escalate your own force as your subordinates grow and become powerful themselves.
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000 But you don't want there to be a huge gap between your power.
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000 Yeah.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000 And theirs.
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000 Because they won't develop into it. They'll just be in the shadow.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000 They won't grow in the shadow. You got to come down and let some light get to them and let them grow.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000 Right.
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:28.000 When the general is weak and without authority, when his orders are not clear and distinct,
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:36.000 when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men and the ranks are formed in a slavingly haphazard manner,
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.000 the result is utter disorganization.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.000 Pretty clear.
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:54.000 If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight.
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:01.000 Even though the ruler forbid it, if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight,
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000 even at the ruler's bidding.
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000 Once again, disobeying the chain of commands, sunsue himself,
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:15.000 disobeying the chain of command.
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:24.000 This is a big one. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace,
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000 who's only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign,
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000 is the jewel of the kingdom.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000 So that guy that's not doing this to get famous, that's not doing this for awards,
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000 that's not doing this to get promoted.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000 It's not being brave to be promoted, he's doing this to protect the country,
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000 or to carry out the mission, not doing it for glory.
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.000 And furthermore, the same person can retreat without feeling like a disgrace.
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000 That means they're going to protect their people without going all we can't fall back.
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:07.000 This person is the jewel of the kingdom, the jewel of the kingdom,
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000 and it's beautiful when you work for people like that. That what they're trying to do is they're trying to do their mission,
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000 they're trying to do good for the country, they're trying to do good for the team, they're trying to do good for the business.
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000 That's what they're trying to do. They're not trying to get promoted,
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.000 they're not trying to get in the war, they're not trying to get a good fitness report,
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000 or a good evaluation, they're trying to do a good job.
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000 And that's why when people ask me a lot, you know,
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000 all I've got this boss that wants to get the credit for everything, give it to them.
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000 Give it to them.
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000 Let them look good.
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000 Don't do it for your glory.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000 Give that glory away. It feels good to give glory away. Give it away.
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.000 I told you, you saw working the nightclub right in the street back when I was young,
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000 and kind of the protocol would be to, you know,
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000 we'd work with whatever, and the bartenders would give us tips.
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000 Like, you don't like a little tips, right?
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000 So at the end of the week, it'd be kind of pulled, right?
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000 And we'd get some tips at the end of the week, school, whatever.
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000 So my boss, so he was back when I first started,
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000 my bought the head door guy, right?
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.000 He was at the end of the week, he called his own little meeting with us.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000 We're like, all right, so he kind of goes over some stuff.
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000 I don't even know what it was.
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:27.000 And he busted at the end. He's like, hey, guys, so, yeah, we have tips.
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000 So what I did was, you know, hey, you guys are doing a great job.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000 I did was, I took my tips and I gave it to you guys.
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000 And he kind of had this look on his face looking at us as if he needed us to be like,
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000 wow, that was so great, but you know, when the look is so transparent,
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000 he's like, so,
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000 I was like, this guy, it's like so disingenuous, you know, like he wanted the credit.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000 And he wanted to be like, oh, thank you, thank you, you know.
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000 It wasn't that much by the way.
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000 Yeah, it was, you know, $14 each.
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000 If that, because we got to divide it up anyway, but yeah, that was like,
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000 is the clear example of that very thing right there where you can tell it.
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000 Giving us the tips, I know what you did that.
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000 Yeah.
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000 You know, okay, you like my younger daughter.
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:20.000 She does good deeds for the sole purpose of increasing birthday present.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000 Christmas present.
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000 Does it that kind of go into a different strategy altogether?
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000 Yeah, that's pretty, it's pretty cute.
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000 And you see this sexual, like, daddy.
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000 I decided it would be really great if I picked up your socks.
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000 Right, since my birthday is coming, right, but that's another tactic.
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000 It's like, it's called a reciprocal something.
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000 Like, when you do something and then you expect something to happen.
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.000 Yeah, but what that, it's effective.
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000 Heart creation is used to do it.
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000 They be like, you know what, hey, hey,
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.000 whatever their message is, and they'd be like, hey, take this free gift.
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000 And they'd be like, I don't know a flower or a book or something.
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000 And they know that that'll leave you the typical person.
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000 They'd leave them with a feeling of dang, like, I kind of owe this person.
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000 He was so nice to me.
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000 I can't just walk off and be a dick.
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000 You know, so I'll give you five bucks or $1,000.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000 Yeah, especially when you recognize they're doing it.
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000 In fact, you do yourself a disservice to fall for it because they're going to keep doing it.
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000 You know, it's basically gilting someone into do something.
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000 But it's called reciproc...
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000 I don't know, something reciprocal, something.
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000 Well, I guess we'll look that up and figure it out later.
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:27.000 Yeah.
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000 Otherwise, what's called reciprocal, something.
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000 Yeah.
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000 All right.
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000 Now here you go.
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000 This is speaking of kids.
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000 This is awesome.
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.000 Regardless of your soldiers as your children,
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000 and they will follow you into the deepest valleys.
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000 Look on them as your own beloved sons,
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000 and they will stand by you even unto death.
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000 Completely true statement.
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000 Mm-hmm.
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000 Completely true statement.
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000 If, however, you are indulgent,
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000 but unable to make your authority felt,
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000 kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands,
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000 and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder,
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000 then your soldiers must be likened to spoiled children.
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000 They are useless for any practical purpose.
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000 I think that speaks for itself.
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000 If you are so lenient with your troops,
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000 when they say indulgent, that's what I mean.
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000 I mean, I mean, a like, super lenient.
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000 When you are lenient with your troops,
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000 when you can't make your authority felt,
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000 when you are super kind-hearted,
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000 you are unable to enforce your commands.
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000 All those things you can have,
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000 and have spoiled little kids for troopers.
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000 And they are not going to be worthless.
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000 I got a little saying about kids.
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000 Lay it on me.
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000 If you are helping them, you are hurting them.
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000 Think about it.
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000 If you are helping them, you are hurting them.
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000 You want me to tie your shoe, tie yourself.
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000 Because when they tie their shoes,
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000 that literally trains their fine motor skills.
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000 If you want them, if they want to glass a water,
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000 go get your own glass a water.
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000 They want help moving something across their hallway.
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000 You move across the hallway.
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000 If you are helping your kids, you are hurting your kids.
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000 And I could take it one step further and say,
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000 if you are hurting your kids, you are helping them.
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000 You are not going to do that.
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000 But really, I do think about that.
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000 When your kids ask you for something,
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000 you have to say, is this something they can do themselves?
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000 Even if it is a struggle form, even if it is a challenge form.
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000 For a while, my daughter was late for school,
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000 and can you just tie my shoes?
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000 No, I can't tie your shoes.
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000 You can tie your shoes.
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000 And that is when they work on their fine motor skills.
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000 And that is when they learn that they can, that they have to get the skill.
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000 They become more self-reliant.
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000 Yeah, yeah, fully in, obviously I am not going to wage some kind of
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000 semantical battle with you or nothing like that.
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000 But it depends on what you mean by help.
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000 And I talked about this before, where you have systemic help in direct help.
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000 So systemic help is exactly what you do in entire own shoes.
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000 How about you get, how about I teach you to tie your shoes?
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000 And prepare you for this shoe tying world that you're about to embark in.
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000 That's systemic help.
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000 That's the real help in my opinion.
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000 Same thing like a homeless person, you give a homeless person a dollar that's direct help.
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000 That doesn't help.
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000 That's hurting him, as you would say.
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000 So what is that called direct help direct?
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000 So don't give your children direct direct help.
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000 Systemic help.
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000 Your job is to prepare kids to do everything.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000 I think that's in a perfect world.
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000 Everything on their own.
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000 By the time they go.
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:03.000 And you actually can prepare a human to do everything on their own because at least you prepare them to face a challenge,
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000 research out over a comment, practice over coming in and over a comment.
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000 So if you teach them, if you teach them, you know you say you can give them a fish or you can teach them a fish.
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000 You can teach them to learn how to fish on their own.
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000 That's what you really want to do.
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000 Yes.
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000 Put that on a t-shirt.
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000 Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000 And if you go the more systemic, you could probably end up breaking it down into maybe three things.
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.000 And you know, whatever those things are, I know they're going to have something to do with how to think, how to manage
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000 emotions, how to adapt like a lot of the real basic things that are going to in one way or another, apply to everything.
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000 Yeah.
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000 It's interesting that you go from this is in back in the book.
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000 I went back to the conversation.
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000 Back to the book.
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000 It's funny how you're talking about sons who are to war and we're talking about kids.
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000 We're talking about business.
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000 We're talking about night clubs.
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000 We're talking about you, Jitsu.
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000 All right.
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000 Back to the book now for real.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:17.000 Those who are called skillful leaders of old, new how to drive a wedge between the enemies front and rear to prevent cooperation between his large and small divisions to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad.
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000 The officers from rallying their men.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000 So when you are looking at your opponent, what can you do to split them up?
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000 What can you do to interfere with what they're trying to make happen?
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000 That's a skill set in its own.
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000 So instead of worrying about attacking you, I'm worried about I'm focused on dispersing you or splitting you up.
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000 Instead of worrying about attacking you, I'm worried about hindering people from helping you.
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000 It's a different way of thinking about waging a battle.
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:55.000 Instead of thinking about the battle itself, what other ways are there to go about this more creatively?
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000 Repidity is the essence of war.
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000 Take advantage of the enemies unreadiness.
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:13.000 Make your way by unexpected routes and attack unguarded spots.
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000 There you go back to the human side of things.
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000 Carefully study the well-being of your men and do not over-tax them.
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000 Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength.
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:34.000 Keep your army continually on the move and devise unfathomable paths.
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000 Now this is interesting.
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000 Throw your soldiers into positions once there is no escape and they will prefer to fight.
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000 They will prefer death to flight.
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:54.000 Officers in men alike will put forth their utmost strength.
01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:03.000 At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him.
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000 He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:14.000 He burns his boats and breaks his cooking pots.
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000 It's a second time we've heard about those cooking pots.
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000 Obviously that men's something back in the day.
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000 That men is on.
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000 We're not coming back.
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000 We're not needing for dinner tonight.
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000 But that's an attitude to have.
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000 It's interesting. This is somewhat contradictory to some of what the other things that he said in the book.
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000 If the enemy is strong, fade away.
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000 Now he's saying, put your soldiers in a position where there's no escape.
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000 That's contrary.
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:56.000 I understand or the way I translate that is if you have to accomplish something very challenging and you have no choice, step into it.
01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000 Step into it, kick away the ladder.
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000 Break your cooking pots and let the guys know we're not coming back from this.
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000 We have what one choice and that's victory.
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000 All in.
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:19.000 Thus, or sorry, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the Keevae.
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000 Keevae, which means who goes, which means on watch, Keevaevae.
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000 Without waiting, this is the important part.
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000 Without waiting to be asked, they will do your will.
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000 Without restriction, they will be faithful.
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000 Without giving orders, they can be trusted.
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:48.000 So, you get the pure decentralized command, where without waiting to be asked to do something, they're going to do it.
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000 That's what you want your troopers to do.
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000 They will do your will.
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000 Without restrictions, they will be faithful.
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.000 You don't have to hold on to me.
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000 You don't have to give them commands.
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000 You don't have to give them orders.
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000 They're going to be faithful to you.
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000 Without giving orders, they can be trusted.
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000 That's true decentralized command.
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:14.000 And that's what you want.
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000 And then, to wrap this one up.
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:30.000 One happy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise.
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000 Meaning he won't have everyone to think.
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000 And we want everybody to be on the same page.
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000 Move not unless you see an advantage.
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000 Use not your troops unless there is something to be gained.
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000 Fight not unless the position is critical.
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000 Again, that's contrary to what I just talked about.
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000 But I think the reason he said that is because sometimes you have to.
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000 Sometimes you get into the decisive situation.
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000 You have to fight.
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000 You have to win.
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000 No ruler should put troops into the field.
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000 Marlee to gratify his own spleen.
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.000 And spleen when he says that that you step be where people.
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000 Thought that the seat of emotion was.
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000 So your emotion came from your spleen.
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000 So he's saying what you've been saying the whole night.
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000 No ruler should put troops in the field.
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000 Nearly to gratify his own emotions.
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000 And that emotion could be a good idea.
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000 It could be irritating.
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.000 No general should fight a battle simply out of peak.
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.000 And that's pride and ego.
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:54.000 If it is to your advantage to make a forward move, make a forward move.
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000 If not, stay where you are.
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:07.000 Such is the art of war.
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:14.000 Obviously, so much to be learned from the past, from the ancients.
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000 And also it's so accessible.
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000 There are so many lessons to be learned there.
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.000 Lessons that if you learn there mistakes that you don't have to make yourself.
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000 All you have to do is open a book.
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000 It open your mind.
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000 And you'll be there.
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000 And I think we can now go to questions from the interwebs.
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000 Let's do it.
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:56.000 But before that, internet stuff, go to onit.com slash jockel.
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000 And why do you want to do that?
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000 Get some good stuff.
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000 Yeah, good stuff.
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000 Supplements.
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000 Shroom tech.
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000 If you're into high intensity workouts for some prolonged period of time,
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000 give to you, give to you that boost and that sustenance.
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000 As far as output goes, alpha brain helps your mind work.
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000 That's the ones that I think we, that I recommend.
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000 And the warrior bar.
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000 Do yourself that favor in life.
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000 And I do the krill oil.
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000 Of course krill oil.
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000 I went to a meeting this week.
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000 They had a big old stack of warrior bars when I went in.
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000 They brought it.
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000 Yeah.
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000 They were in the game.
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000 My boy Zach was in the game down there.
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000 You know, that'll surely enhance the meeting for sure where you're going.
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000 Get it.
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000 You did.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000 First question.
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000 Jockel.
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000 As an overthinker, you missed some factors.
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000 Exiety, low confidence, low IQ,
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000 or IQ, perfectionism, and often a failure to prioritize.
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000 Yeah.
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000 So this is a question from the last podcast.
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000 And this guy just sent me this tweet. And I thought it was a good assessment.
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000 Right.
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000 Because I'm not an overthinker.
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000 And maybe this guy is, and sorry, don't have his Twitter calls on there.
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000 But he maybe he's an overthinker.
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000 So he kind of knew about it.
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000 And if you don't remember the question, you know, someone that over thinks things,
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000 they get analysis paralysis, right?
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000 They just start thinking and thinking and thinking.
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000 They're frozen from their own thoughts.
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000 Too many thoughts.
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000 And so I thought these were good little factors here.
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000 And it basically, to me, and all boils down to actually fear.
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000 Because if you're thinking, then you're not taking action.
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000 And if you're not taking action, then there's no consequence.
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000 And if there's no consequence, and there's not any afraid of.
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.000 So I think that the overthinking can be an excuse for actual fear.
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000 And same thing with like, all my perfectionist.
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000 That's also fear. It's fear of not being perfect.
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000 And then on top of that low confidence, well, if you have low confidence, guess what?
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000 You're afraid.
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000 Your confidence is low.
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000 You're not sure yourself.
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000 So you sit around and think about doing it instead of actually doing it.
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000 And then anxiety.
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000 Well, yeah, anxiety actually is fear.
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000 You're afraid to do something.
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000 And then IQ.
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.000 Now that might be, I guess, maybe someone has a high IQ, and therefore they're thinking a lot.
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000 And maybe that's not fear.
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000 But let me ask you a question.
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000 If you're so smart, then why aren't you taking the action and making something happens?
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000 We've got a big IQ that's no excuse to sit around and overthink things.
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000 Especially because if you're so smart, why can't you come up with a quick solution?
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000 Why can't you realize that overthinking is actually causing the problem of harm?
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000 It's not moving the problem forward.
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000 So quick thinking so much and take action.
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000 Next question.
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000 He's talking about the Tim Ferriss, the video.
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000 That was the extension of your Tim Ferriss.
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000 Yeah, yeah.
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000 You're talking about martial arts.
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000 Or martial arts.
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000 What are the best martial arts?
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000 Right.
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000 If you haven't seen it, you can look it up.
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:53.000 So he says, with respect to the above mentioned video about your views on real martial arts,
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000 I have one quick question.
01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.000 You said that you came to your conclusion based on a sparring match between yourself and one of your fellow Navy Seals.
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:08.000 Was the match between yourself and the traditional martial arts with 20 years experience of friendly sparring match, typical in training,
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.000 where he was pulling his punches and strikes or was he attacking you with full force.
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000 From my observation, you did two guys collect some headshots while going in for a take down.
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:27.000 And if a traditional Karateka karate practitioner doesn't hold back with this had some devastating effects in the long run,
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000 similar to what Profit Balls players experience.
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000 I would love to get your take on this someone who is real world experience.
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.000 Okay, so first of all, I didn't come to a conclusion based on that one event.
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:48.000 I mean, that event influenced my thoughts today, but even right now I don't have a conclusion.
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000 Someone could show me something today.
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000 It's possible that I go, wow, that worked really well.
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000 I never thought of that and that's new.
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000 That now trumps everything else.
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000 It could happen.
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000 Not likely though.
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000 My mind is still open, but that's not likely.
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000 I've seen a lot.
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000 Now in that particular scenario, he was usually, he wasn't using a striking art, a traditional striking art.
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000 He was using a traditional grappling art actually, I keto.
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000 And so he was grappling with me.
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:24.000 He wasn't throwing punches at me, but it doesn't matter because I have spared and or fought with plenty of people over the years.
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000 That were absolutely trying to knock me out, no doubt about it.
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:34.000 And the fact of the matter is, it doesn't work.
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:43.000 Even where this guy above, like, for instance, this guy in the question, he says, if a traditional karate practitioner doesn't hold back,
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:50.000 it would have the same devastating effect in the long run similar to what pro football players experience.
01:17:50.000 --> 01:18:01.000 That statement actually defeats itself because if you watch a football game, those guys get hit in the head a hundred times during a football game.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000 And how often do they get actually knocked unconscious? Not very often.
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:12.000 If you multiply whatever ten players per side that are actually banging heads, times however many plays, you know,
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:19.000 you're talking about thousand, you know, probably more than a thousand head on head contacts in a football game.
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000 And there might be one knockout in a game.
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000 Sometimes there's no knockouts.
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000 Yeah.
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000 Typically not knockouts.
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.000 The fact of the matter is hitting someone in the head is not a guaranteed knockout by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it rarely occurs.
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000 It actually rarely occurs in boxing.
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000 You know, where two guys are trained to do that.
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000 So it's hard to knock somebody out.
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000 And it's the same thing in if you watch UFC, especially the early UFC's.
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000 This was proven over and over again.
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000 That, yeah, the grappler is going to take some hits on the way in, but they're going to get in.
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000 And they're going to take the person down.
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000 And of course, do you have a punch or chance? Of course you do.
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:07.000 There's a very small chance that when you shoot it on somebody, they time a knee or they time a punch and it happens to hit you right in the spot that knocks you out.
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000 It does happen. It happens and you have to see occasionally.
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:17.000 If you look at a number of take-downs to the number of knockouts that happen while the take-down is going on, it's not a big number at all.
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000 Correct.
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000 You don't want to rely on that as your formation of self-defense at all.
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000 Now when things evolved, eventually to where the strikers were wrestlers too.
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000 And you got guys like Chuck and you got T-do and you got Randy where it wasn't their striking that was preventing the take-down.
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000 It was because they were badass wrestlers.
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000 That's what we stopped in the take-down.
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000 Had nothing to do with the way they punched.
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:48.000 So you really can't count on striking to stop a grappler.
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000 That is not a good plan to say, hey, I'm going to get so good at striking that I'm going to stop a grappler.
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000 That is not a good plan. What you have to do is learn to grapple.
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000 You have to learn to wrestle. You have to learn to do it too.
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:08.000 And the opposite side of that is you can't count on grappling to take down a striker because that person might know how to wrestle.
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000 And therefore you need to know how to strike.
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000 So it goes back to what I say all the time.
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000 You got to know how to grab and get to know how to strike.
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:21.000 Right. Yeah. And if he's talking, he says a traditional karate practitioner.
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000 Traditional.
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:29.000 So I'm assuming that the only understanding I have of traditional is he doesn't do karate and he just doesn't.
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000 He's not a mixed martial artist. He just knows karate.
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000 So what I've lost on ground.
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:43.000 Yes, and I've taken karate before and there was no take down defense. There was no take down. There was no functioning in any capacity on the ground.
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000 And so.
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:54.000 Yeah. And how you say like, okay, over the long term, okay, you're going to have head trauma and lasting damage.
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000 If you take sustained.
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000 Yeah.
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000 Head trauma repetitive.
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000 Over the years, really, but we're worried about the next 42 seconds of a fight that's about to happen.
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000 Not the next 30 decades of my life where you can see me break down because I took some head trauma.
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:16.000 Exactly. Right. So you'd have to get, let's say that for the example of this question that you're experienced with this guy.
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000 He was a karate guy and he was going full speed.
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000 And he didn't knock you out. We'll just assume that he didn't knock you up.
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000 You'd have to go.
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000 I'm going to restate that that is a very safe assumption to assume that the karate guy was not able to knock me out.
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:37.000 That I was able to come in, you know, stand there, get it a good distance,
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000 faking with my hands, touch his face a couple times. He throws a big punch.
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000 I do a double leg take down. He's on his back.
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000 It's game over.
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000 Yeah.
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000 And by the way, go watch any YouTube video of, you know,
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:59.000 get to versus whatever and it's the same outcome every single time. You know, occasionally there'll be one with a lot of hits because it's the chance knock out or the chance of something else happened.
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000 Yeah.
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.000 But 99% of the time, it's double leg take down slam on the ground, game over.
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000 Yeah.
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000 Sorry.
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000 Look at who did Randy Couture fight that Pro Boxer, Tony James Tony.
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000 Oh yeah.
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000 It was that exactly. Here's a world-class boxer professional boxer. What did Randy do?
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000 Got inside, took him down, came over.
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000 Oh, why didn't you knock him out?
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000 Because you can't.
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000 Right. You can't just knock people out.
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:27.000 Yeah.
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:27.000 Yeah.
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000 Fully.
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000 And that's not to mention it. I mean, I'm going to mention it.
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000 But that it is not to mention that,
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:43.000 especially if you practice that the more self-defense, like it's heavily self-defense oriented due to one of the first things you learn is distance management.
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000 One other first things you learn.
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000 It's like, you almost can't get past that element of it.
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000 So you will take hits, of course.
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000 Maybe you'll take it to the top of your head, shoulders or whatever.
01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:02.000 But yes, significant strikes to anything to warrant how it's stated here in the question long-term damage compared to football players.
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000 You back to your situation.
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000 You going with this guy, let's say he did go full speed.
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000 You would have to do probably 10 to 15 bounce of that every single day.
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000 For a long time.
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000 For you to have any sustained damage.
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000 And then.
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000 So maybe if this guy is taking the long-term strategic view,
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000 you're going to continue to spar me.
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000 Hit me in the head and time.
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000 I'm saying, you're the old man.
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000 Maybe you're a realistic disease.
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000 And maybe I'm saying maybe.
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000 So because if he's a traditional guy, he doesn't know how to manage the take down.
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000 So knowing how to manage the take down makes your strikes more effective.
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000 You don't have that.
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000 Your strikes are not effective.
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000 So okay, you take one hit.
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000 Let's say, let's say you take five hits.
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000 Right?
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000 You controlling the fight as much as you did to does.
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000 Even if you're not that high level versus the guy who doesn't know judi-to.
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000 Way outweighs this grossly.
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000 To the point that these things are aside from the punchers chance.
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000 In effective.
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000 And I think UFC 1, 2, 3.
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000 You know, as before people started to get hit to the whole judi-to thing.
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000 But before people knew judi-to.
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000 They just knew there are other stuff.
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000 That was the testing ground.
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000 And I was the whole reason UFC was invented by the way.
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000 And that's why those first UFCs are awesome.
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000 Yeah, you get to see these 250 and no bare knuckle kickboxer guys strong.
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:24.000 You know, go in there with real quote unquote real fighting experience against a way smaller grappler.
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000 Do you get to guy in lose?
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000 In fact.
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000 This is to go one step further if you watch UFC 2.
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000 Pat Smith, who's one of my favorite guys by the way when I was watching is the kickboxer.
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000 It was bad ask guy.
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000 Two 10 solid wrecking guys makes it to the finals against voice greasy.
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000 And the voice greasy didn't tap them out.
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000 Or he tapped them out.
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000 But now with the submission hold, he tapped them due to strikes.
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000 So a grappler guy found it out.
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000 You know, a striker guy.
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000 No submissions.
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000 It was all punches.
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000 It was nowadays known with every top to that now.
01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000 But I'm just saying.
01:24:59.000 --> 01:24:59.000 Yeah.
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000 Only because they know.
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000 If you don't know.
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000 You just think you're dead.
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000 Yeah.
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:03.000 Yeah.
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000 Yeah. One guy like I said before, one guy tapped because he was claustrophobic. He just got mounted.
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000 But nonetheless.
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000 Yeah.
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000 It's hard to really reconcile really what this question.
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000 I don't know if it's implying anything.
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000 Well, it's definitely implying that this guy that I was going against was like holding back.
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000 Right.
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000 And that might it, you know, hold the different tail if you don't.
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000 Yeah.
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:32.000 I've been against countless, literally countless of guys have spared against me trying to knock me out.
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000 Whether they're traditional martial artists, whether they're just countless guys.
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000 Yeah.
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000 And it's hard to knock somebody out.
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000 Yeah.
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000 And I don't know who that's a question. Of course I'm not going to, you know, hate on the question or nothing like that.
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000 But speaking from experience, this sounds like the exact question that inexperienced people have.
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:56.000 You know, people who are, well, it's, no, this is coming most likely from somebody that's been heavily involved in traditional martial arts.
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000 And it had been told that, hey, don't worry about somebody trying to take you down because if you just hit him here and here,
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000 or they'll fall and you'll win.
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000 That's exactly what I'm talking about.
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000 That's not, that's not good.
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000 That's sort of what I put this in here.
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:14.000 And you know, just to make sure that, um, that they realize that, hey, you shouldn't, you should actually pay attention to what else is going on in the world.
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.000 Instead of staying in like, hey, just this one little traditional martial art.
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000 Yeah.
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000 And it's the same thing with you.
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000 If you're just doing GJ2 and I got this in here later, there's another question about this.
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000 But I mean, I don't tell people just train GJ2.
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000 I tell them, train GJ2, train Dressling, train Boxing, train Moitai.
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000 Yeah.
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000 And you know what, when you get done with all that and you have a good based train Krav Maga,
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000 and then you, you know what, do realistic situations.
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000 By the way, you should learn how to shoot a gun.
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000 By the way, you should be in good shape.
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000 Do everything.
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000 Yeah.
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000 Yeah.
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000 Yeah.
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000 One answer is not the answer.
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000 Yeah.
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000 T-shirt.
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000 Next question.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000 Every time we say something like that, like a one.
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000 Answer is not the answer, which I must admit sounds pretty cool.
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000 That's pretty dope.
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000 But we'll get everyone's going to say, put that on a t-shirt.
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000 And then I have to refer to echo and see if he's going to put it on a t-shirt.
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000 You know, we'll see how that works out.
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000 All right.
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000 Next question.
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:21.000 Is it better to reveal too much information or too little information, both in personal life and leadership?
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000 Okay.
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:32.000 So there's two sides to this, not just the personal and the business side, but in the business side, there's two pieces really.
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000 There's operational and planning, right?
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:44.000 So if you've got something that you're planning for, whether you're in a company and you're trying to plan a new strategy for the next quarter or the next year or the next company that you're going to open or the new coat.
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000 Whatever you're going to do, there's that and you're planning that.
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.000 Then I want to and and in the military if you're planning an operation, you're putting together a mission that you're going to go do in both those situations.
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000 I give everyone all the information that I have absolutely.
01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000 I don't.
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000 I let them know everything that I know so that they can weigh everything as much as I weigh.
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000 In fact, I want them to toil with the with the information more than I do.
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000 So that I can kind of get a fresher look at it when I come in.
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:20.000 So and I think I do and I did see people that would hold back information in those situations, leaders that would hold back information.
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000 Why would they do that because they're insecure?
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000 Because knowledge gives you power.
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:32.000 And you use that knowledge to say, you come in and echo's got a good plan put together and I go, yeah, but you've got to think about this right here.
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000 And you just say, well, I didn't know that.
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000 But it gives me a little bit of leverage, it gives me a little bit of power.
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.000 That's ridiculous. So when it comes to planning and operations and conducting business and planning missions,
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000 man share all the information you've got in your organization, now to your organization.
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000 So everybody has the knowledge.
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000 That's answer number one.
01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:03.000 Then we get to the information regarding the leadership of humans.
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:08.000 You do your words like transparency and we got to be honest and you hear those things getting thrown around.
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000 And of course, no one's going to argue with them.
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000 Right? No one's going to argue and say, hey, you shouldn't be honest.
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000 No one's going to say you shouldn't be transparent, right?
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:25.000 But the fact of the matter is you cannot always share all the information all the time when it comes to leading people.
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000 You can't do it.
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:34.000 And here's the problem of why you can't do it because people can't always handle the truth.
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000 And when you give them the truth, they might have a bunch of different reactions, right?
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000 Some of those reactions being anger and defensiveness.
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:50.000 So in other words, if I tell someone, hey, I'm putting this other person in charge because I don't think you're smarter enough to figure out the solution.
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000 That's my true statement. I'm going to be honest with you.
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000 I don't think you're smart.
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000 What is that, too? How does that affect the mission?
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000 Does it move us closer to the goal?
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:07.000 Is that person now going to be really supportive of me and work hard knowing that I think they're stupid?
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000 The answer is of course not.
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000 I mean, another example is what if you think that your boss's plan is terrible?
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000 So you go in there and say, hey, your boss's terrible, your plan that you came up with is awful.
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.000 Now, there might be some bosses that are secure in their leadership and their secure with it.
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000 And they go, oh man, why do you think that?
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000 Here, break it down for me. That's cool.
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000 But a lot of bosses are going to be insulted by that.
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000 A lot of bosses are going to hurt their ego.
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:41.000 And instead of listening to the idea that you have, instead, they're going to be angered by it.
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000 They're going to turn it off. They're going to turn off their minds. They're going to be mad at you.
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000 They're not going to listen to you anymore because the way you came across.
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:57.000 So you would have been better off not being quote unquote honest and not sharing all the information.
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:05.000 You would have been better off slowly trying to take the plan that he came up with and maybe maneuver on it or maybe say, hey,
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:11.000 boss, I don't know if that's going to work because of this thing over here, but you'd be tactful.
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000 And there's a million examples we could talk of like that.
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:24.000 And so when it comes to leading people, not operations, not planning missions, but when it comes to leading people, you need to think.
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:32.000 Think about what you're saying, thinking about how it's going to impact the relationships, up and down the chain of command.
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:38.000 Think about how it's going to impact the mission because if you're a good leader anywhere on that,
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000 anywhere on that chain of command, if you're a good leader, the most important thing you should be achieving the mission.
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:50.000 So if you're honesty is actually creating adversarial relationships inside your team, what good are you doing, moving the mission forward?
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000 The answer is you're not.
01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:02.000 So I'm not telling you to be dishonest, but I'm telling you to think.
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000 And it's the same thing in your personal life.
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.000 You've got to think about what you're saying. You've got to think about your wife's perspective,
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000 or your husband's perspective, or your kids' perspective, or your friends' perspective.
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:24.000 How is what I'm about to say going to affect them long-term?
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000 You've got to be measured. Now you might give them a little hint of something.
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:38.000 And then see how they react and maybe you could be a little bit more honest with them. Maybe you could throw some bait out there and see if they bite on it.
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:50.000 But you just don't want to jump in or throw it out to where now you've created an adversarial relationship with your friend,
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:56.000 with your spouse, with your kid, because now they're not listening to you.
01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000 And with your kids, oh, you got to be totally honest with your kids. Okay. You know what?
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000 Totally honestly. I don't think you're capable of being this level of an athlete.
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:10.000 Right? Do they need to hear that when they're nine years old? Probably not.
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000 Hmm.
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.000 So you just kind of think.
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.000 You got to think. And there's a ways to get that information across
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.000 in a tactical way, in an indirect way, so that it still manages to improve the person.
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000 Hmm.
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000 Because I don't want to have echo come up with you come up with a bunch of bad ideas.
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000 And all I do is say, oh, that's a good idea. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. That's a good idea.
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000 And train you. I didn't improve you.
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000 I want to say, hey, you know what? That's not bad. What if we did this? You know what I mean? And so we move in the right direction.
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000 Hmm.
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000 We still have some mentorship going on, but it's indirect. We still have some coaching going on.
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:56.000 But it's indirect because I don't want to coach you and you don't want to be coached by me.
01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000 You even my son.
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:08.000 When I like tell him something in jujitsu, I've been doing jujitsu for over 20 years with some of the best guys in the entire world.
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000 Hmm.
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:14.000 And I'll say, hey, Thor, you need to scoot your hip a little bit more and you do that move. And I go, no, you don't.
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:24.000 Really? No, actually you do it. What he'll listen to Jeff. He'll listen to Dean. Actually, you won't actually have heard him argue with both Jeff and Dean.
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000 He's a view of their approach.
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000 Yeah, maybe he'll be a little more into that.
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000 Yeah, they're a good man.
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:37.000 And that kind of illustrates one of the many challenges with that. You know, one of these simple, but not easy things.
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000 Because everyone's different. How you saying throw something out there to see how they respond. Everyone's going to respond different.
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000 That's the thing. So it is kind of this feeling of process.
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:53.000 It's, you know, I think that and I mentioned this before, where you know, some people will be direct, but people don't really like them.
01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:01.000 And then they they'll kind of double down on it and say, hey, you know, I speak the truth, you know, and like me for who I am or whatever.
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.000 So what you do when you do that when people do that is they render themselves ineffective in situations.
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000 Now no one's, let's just show exactly right. And guess what, no one's inviting you to their party. No one's to be a friend.
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.000 You know, you may or may not have gotten the divorce from it. And it's all because you, essentially, you just chose to be a dick.
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:27.000 Look, we all understand that certain things are insulting if you're quote unquote too honest, you know, everyone except you.
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:32.000 You know, if you look around and no one wants to be around you, that's a problem.
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000 Yeah, news flash.
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.000 You're a jerk. Yes. And the edge and people don't follow jerks.
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:45.000 They really don't. Yeah. So it's not it. It's not honesty is never an excuse to be a jerk to people.
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000 Yeah. And don't mistake.
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000 You know, people of this kind of misconception that speaking your mind is a good thing.
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000 It's not back in white.
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000 You're totally right. Don't be like, hey, that's it.
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:10.000 That's it's so crazy about this is like, um, people, I think always have that feeling. I mean, I said it when I was talking, you know, people say, oh, of course honesty is, you know, the best thing you got to be honest.
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:19.000 And I would say that I am, I am known as a person that is honest and a straight shooter.
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000 And that's great.
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:30.000 But at the same time, like you just said, that doesn't mean I run around it in salt people. It means I'm a tactician. You know what?
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000 It's not honesty. It's tact. It's being a tactician.
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000 Because this is something that can actually go too far as well.
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:48.000 If you're constantly always telling everyone thing every all sugar coated, well, now the known and respectful opinion either.
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:56.000 You just hear them saying, if I just say, oh, echo, you did a great job with that video. You did a great job with that video too. You did great. Well, what if you were producing junk videos?
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000 I need to tell you. I know it's a rough example.
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000 I would need to think of something that you didn't do such high quality or pointy thing.
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:12.000 But I've got to, I've got to be honest with you. And if all I do is tell you, hey, it's great. It's great. It's great. It's great. It's great. It's great. It's great. You know, that doesn't help us.
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:21.000 What I need to say is, hey, man, that's an awesome video. It'd be cool if you captured this angle too, right? Or, do you think it'd be possible to get this message across also?
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000 And you'd say, oh, I can do anything. You see how I just played during that?
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000 Did you see how I did that? Yeah.
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000 Yeah. Like, oh, do you think it's even possible to get this angle in there?
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000 Oh, yeah, I could make it come across strong.
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000 Dang. I didn't even know there was a fight.
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000 You didn't just want to, I just had a little bit of a injury up in here.
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000 Yeah. So it's not black and white. You know, or like everything, it's a balance. It's a balance.
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:50.000 It's a black codomy. Yes. It's a codomy between telling the truth and being taxful.
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000 Yeah.
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000 Next question.
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000 Jocco, how do you handle it when someone up the chain of command?
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000 Be trays, trust.
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000 Like, what is this like lying? They lied to you.
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000 Yeah, well, this could be, this is a huge, this is a huge spectrum of things.
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000 I guess. So for number one, you just learned.
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000 Right. You just learned something about someone's character.
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000 Yeah. You now kind of know better what you're dealing with.
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:25.000 Now, if this is a major situation, you might have to immediately confront it and or go above them in the chain of command.
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.000 I mean, if there's lives at risk, if there's something morally wrong that is happening,
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000 if there's something illegal that's happening, that now you're going to get wrapped into.
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000 And that's another decision you got to make. If you're not going to be wrapped into it, then it's a decision you got to make.
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000 If you want to ruin this person's life, whatever. That's a different decision.
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000 That's not this question. We'd have to deal with that in a separate question.
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000 Are innocent people being hurt?
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000 So if it's something like that, lives at risk, something morally wrong is happening.
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000 Something illegal is happening.
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000 Innocent people being hurt, then you're probably going to have to say something.
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000 You're going to have to say something.
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:06.000 Now, I would say this before you say something.
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.000 Make sure all your ducks in a row, make sure you have evidence.
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.000 Don't go off half cock to be ready because people that are deceitful like this.
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:25.000 They prepare. They are ready for battle to protect themselves and they don't care what happens to other people.
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:31.000 So you're going to watch out for that. Now, if it's something minor, you know, if it's something minor,
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.000 then that's something that you log down in the brain.
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:39.000 Something that you log down in the brain.
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000 And, um,
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000 but it allows you to see person's character.
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:54.000 And that means again, it's a minor infraction, but it also means you've got to watch yourself and you've got to watch them a little bit more closely.
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000 You've got to be careful because people like that.
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000 They think they're smarter than everyone else.
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000 They think that they're getting away with life.
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:12.000 So they think they're smarter and there's like a little hint of social path in there that they can get away with these lies.
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000 And so you've got to watch them.
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000 You got to watch them carefully.
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000 And like I said, it kind of goes back to that previous question.
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000 Because you don't want to be a person that comes across as dishonest yourself.
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000 And if people don't think they can trust what you're saying, they're not going to trust you.
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000 With other things.
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:43.000 So if you know I'm not giving you good feedback because I'm too nice, you're not going to start.
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000 You're not going to respect my opinion anymore.
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.000 So, you know, when you're when you're dealing with someone, if someone comes to you instead of again,
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:58.000 this is honesty versus dishonest. If you come to me and say, hey, what do you think of this plan?
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:02.000 I'm not going to say, I think that's a stupid plan.
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.000 I might say, I don't know if that's how I do it. I might try this approach, right?
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:14.000 You're just going to be diplomatic if you, if I'm not going to say to you, I don't think you're smarter enough to figure this out.
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000 I want to move you to a different division because I don't think you're smarter enough to solve this problem.
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000 I'm not going to say that.
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:25.000 I'm going to say, you know what? I need you on this other project over here that I think you're going to be really knock this thing out of the park.
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000 Now you're going to know deep inside.
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.000 But it's called tact.
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000 And that's what you have to use.
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:43.000 But back to the honesty or when person betrays your trust, you've learned, you've learned about their character.
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.000 If it's a big thing, you're going to have to talk about it. You're going to have to tell somebody.
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000 It's a little thing.
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000 You got to watch.
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000 Kivie, I think we just learned that vocabulary tonight.
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000 Who's there? Watch.
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000 Yeah.
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000 You know how you see? And you log it in your brain.
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000 Right. Logging in your brain. That okay. They lied about that.
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000 Or oh, I. And I think you should constantly do that.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000 Right. And I think we all do that anyway. That's really, I think that's why.
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.000 And your brain has certain ways just the way it's wired. Like first impressions.
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000 Right. That's usually a big thing.
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.000 But really what's really going on isn't that the first impression is this has more weight,
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000 specifically than other impressions that you get along the line.
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000 It's because let's say you don't, let's say I don't know that much about you.
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000 I don't know. Really, this is the first time I've ever met you heard about you, whatever.
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.000 Your first impression is not that it's so heavy. It's just it's the only impression.
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000 So it seems like everything. If you're addicted to me, okay, you're addicted.
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000 In my mind, you're just addicted.
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.000 Second day, you're not addicted. You're 50% addicted, which is that still addicted.
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000 You know, even if you're 20% addicted, you're like, okay, I like on buddy still addicted.
01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000 You know, so again, my point is you're always logging stuff in your brain.
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000 What is this person? What is this person? Not when it comes to someone who betrayed your trust.
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000 This doesn't really count them out as far as trusting them.
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000 Because a lot of times the more time you spend with them, the more experience you have with them,
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000 you start to get a picture of, okay, he'll be trained by trust in this case, in this type of situation.
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000 It's like if you have a friend who he would literally risk his life to save your life,
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000 but at the same time, he would probably hook up with your wife.
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.000 If you had the opportunity, you know, so there's different kind of things.
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.000 So as you gain experience with people, he is therefore risking his own life.
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000 That's a true story.
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000 Sure, of course. But you start to get a picture of who the person is.
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000 And I don't have any friends like that.
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.000 But I do know what you're saying.
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:48.000 Yes.
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:54.000 People that have different moral compass and moral values, and so you're judging them based on that.
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:54.000 Right.
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000 Yes. So just be careful not to judge a Mason.
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000 That's all.
01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000 We're talking about the point.
01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000 We're talking about the point.
01:43:59.000 --> 01:43:59.000 Yes.
01:43:59.000 --> 01:43:59.000 Yes.
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000 But that's part of this big picture.
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000 So, because ultimately you want to get to the point,
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000 and I've had this experience specifically in my life before where
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000 you know, you want to get to the point where you trust them.
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000 Yeah, I trust them to be that person.
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000 You know, I know he's not trustworthy in this, but he's trustworthy.
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000 So yeah, he's role in my life or in this company or whatever.
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000 I know.
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000 I trust him to be him.
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000 Therefore, I won't give him this task.
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000 You trust him to be them.
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000 Yes, exactly right.
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000 I trust the scorpion to be the scorpion.
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000 Exactly.
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000 The frog to be the frog.
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:31.000 Yes.
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000 And that comes with like the experience.
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000 So if someone, you know, if it's like you said if it's a minor thing,
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000 don't go jumped on his throat or just jumped to this thing,
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000 really just be like, okay, you know, deal with it in your way,
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000 but like I said, log in in your brain and move forward.
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000 What, you know, and keep your eyes open to things that you can trust more about.
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000 Yeah, and get that full picture.
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000 And I hate to say this enough set of before.
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000 I don't have these massively high expectations of other human beings.
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000 Yeah.
01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.000 I hate to say it, but I'm kind of anticipating that they're telling me half truths.
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000 Yeah.
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000 Yeah.
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:08.000 So don't get these high expectations and expect that people are going to try and get one over on you.
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000 Yeah.
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000 And then when you do get your core of people that you know are really truly trustworthy,
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000 that's awesome.
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:14.000 Yeah.
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000 That might be three people in your life.
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000 Yeah.
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:17.000 Yeah.
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000 And that's, I would say that that's fair.
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.000 You know, I think a lot of people are like that.
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000 And I think everyone's like that in one way or another.
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000 You know, and it's a spectrum.
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000 But I've been in a situation where,
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000 So when say, hey, do you know this guy?
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000 I'm going to be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000 They'll be like, yeah, are your friends with that guy?
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000 Like, isn't he hard to trust because of like this?
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000 And I'll say, I don't find him hard to trust.
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000 I trust him to be him.
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.000 And just exactly how you're saying you trust the scorpion to be a scorpion.
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000 Yeah.
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.000 You know, scorpion can be relied upon for specific things and straight up can't be relied upon for certain other things.
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000 So again, if you just keep your eyes open and you know,
01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000 don't start burning bridges with the person if it's this small thing.
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.000 As time goes on, you can start to get a feel of really who this person is in the entirety.
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000 And it might be beneficial in the situation you're in with them.
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000 Know your people.
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000 I agree.
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.000 Next question.
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000 Here's a strange one.
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:26.000 I have ongoing regret for never joining the military or police department.
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:31.000 And I'm not yet strong enough to consider changing careers now for financial reasons.
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:37.000 I also don't know how to discuss this with my wife as we want to make some additions to the family soon.
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000 I feel unfifilled in the single aspect of my life.
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.000 It's a strange feeling, considering I have skyrocketed up the chain in my company.
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000 So quickly.
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000 So many would do anything to be where I find myself.
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000 How do you overcome your face or how do you overcome or face your son?
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:59.000 Or face yourself knowing you're holding back from a certain calling?
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000 Because I really do see it as a calling in some form.
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000 I'm interested to hear from you.
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000 I think this is pretty easy.
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000 Go join the reserves.
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000 Go join the reserves.
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000 Go in the army reserves.
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000 Go in the like every branch has some reserves.
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000 Where you're going to do one weekend a month.
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000 You have to do boot camp.
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000 That'll be whatever it's going to be.
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000 10 weeks, 12 weeks, 14 weeks depending on which branch you go into.
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000 And then you do one week and a month.
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000 And you do two weeks in the summer.
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000 You'll understand what the military is about.
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000 There's actually a chance.
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000 Well, first of all, there's a chance to be deployed.
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000 I mean, when we were in Iraq, you know, when we deployed to Ramadi,
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000 my second deployment to Iraq, the unit that was there, the 228 iron soldiers.
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000 They were reserved, you need out of Pennsylvania.
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000 They were awesome.
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000 They've been there for 14 months.
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000 And they lost a lot of guys and they fought hard.
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.000 So it's not like this reserveist thing is is is a different class of soldier.
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000 They're soldiers for real.
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000 They're Marines for real.
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000 And you may be going on deployment.
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:08.000 But what's cool about it is most companies, they will excuse you,
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000 basically, when you go in the reserves.
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000 They'll excuse you when you have time.
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000 In fact, I think it's, I was never in the reserves.
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000 But I think you're actually protected by the federal government from being fired
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000 because you're serving in the reserves.
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.000 So I would definitely go and look into the reserves because otherwise,
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000 that feeling that you have, I can only imagine it's never going to go away.
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000 I don't know because I had that feeling that I wanted to join the military
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000 when I was four years old and I did it, it seems like turned 18.
01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.000 So I don't, you know, I, you know what I regret now is like,
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000 I want to still be in, you know?
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.000 So especially now with the fighting picking up overseas,
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:53.000 it's, you know, that's the only thing that, that I feel is damn.
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000 I want to go back.
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000 But if you never did it at all, that's a grinding feeling.
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000 So go, talk to recruiter, get the reserves and you know what else.
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000 In certain areas, there's definitely volunteer, fired apartments.
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000 And you can volunteer as a fireman.
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000 And you can volunteer as a policeman.
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000 They have certain, I don't know, I have no idea what state you're from.
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:15.000 Asking a question, but there's deputies, you can get deputized,
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.000 you can go through a, in San Diego, they definitely have reserve cops,
01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000 where you have to go to, you have to go to the, the police academy,
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000 and you become a reserve cop.
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000 So, and with all that, you want to talk about it with your wife,
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000 talk about it with your wife.
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000 Yeah.
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.000 You know, you say you don't know how to.
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000 This is in the situation where you can be totally honest with it.
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000 Hey, I always wanted to join the military.
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000 I haven't done it.
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000 I feel like it's something I really want to do.
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000 Here's the options I want to go look at.
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000 What do you think?
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:48.000 Now, you're marrying, you married to a girl and you're going to have kids.
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000 It's your military service.
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000 We'll be hard-grown, her, then, it is on you.
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000 So, she better be strong, she better be tough.
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000 And, you know, the military wives out there.
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000 I mean, my wife, when I was gone and deployment after deployment,
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000 it's, it's not easy.
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000 I mean, luckily, she's tough.
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000 And she raised kids without me.
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000 And she took care of household without me.
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000 And she went to the hospital to visit my wounded guys.
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000 And she went to the funeral of my guys, but we're getting killed.
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000 And she had to do that while I was gone on deployment.
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000 And I was she was here for me once a week, maybe.
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000 So, you're going to put your family through a lot of stress.
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000 Now, you might stress your family a lot by always having regret
01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000 that they held you back.
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000 Mm.
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000 That's selfish, but that's true.
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000 So, I would just go look into it, see what the options are.
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000 Talk about it with your wife.
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000 There's some really good benefits to it.
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000 And also, the final point is sometimes when you're
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.000 reservist, you can decide that you want to go act of duty.
01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000 Maybe you love it.
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000 Maybe you say, yeah, this was my calling.
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000 Maybe your fourth day in boot camp, where you haven't slept,
01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.000 you had your head shaved, your tired, your hungry, the food is horrible.
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000 And you say, man, this is what I've always wanted to do with my life.
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000 And if that happens, there's options where you can now go
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000 active duty.
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000 And you can see how your wife dealt with it while you're gone.
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000 And if she dealt with it well, that's great.
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000 Hey, let's make a career out of this.
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000 And that's a good option to do.
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.000 So, I think your, this is, this is an easy day.
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000 Easy, easy problem to take care of.
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000 Mm.
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000 No factor.
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000 Just a second.
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000 Next question.
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000 Juggle, what's your take on sport?
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:36.000 Jiu Jitsu versus self defense, Jiu Jitsu.
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000 And can sport transport, Jiu Jitsu can translate onto the street.
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000 Most schools are geared towards sport.
01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000 Yeah, so for anyone that's listening that doesn't do Jiu Jitsu, both of you
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000 without or out there that don't do Jiu Jitsu, that listening.
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000 First of all, do Jiu Jitsu.
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000 Second of all, so there's, there's,
01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000 Jiu Jitsu is rooted really in self defense.
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.000 And like anything that gets put into a,
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:13.000 a closed environment, it starts to breed and become different and mutate.
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:19.000 And so, Jiu Jitsu in a way, what they call, what they now call sport, Jiu Jitsu,
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:25.000 is Jiu Jitsu that has been in this competition environment in the Jiu Jitsu sport competition environment.
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000 So, Jiu Jitsu is a sport as well as self defense.
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:32.000 It's a sport with points and you can win on points and they have championships and it's very competitive.
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:37.000 And it's, it's pretty entertaining to watch if you know and understand the game.
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:45.000 But since it's in this environment, this closed environment, it starts to mutate.
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000 And that's what's happened.
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:52.000 So, for instance, there's maneuvers that you do in sport, Jiu Jitsu,
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.000 that are so intricate.
01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:01.000 And there's so reliant on, for instance, reliant on the ghee,
01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:06.000 the Jiu Jitsu uniform, which is a heavy fabric, a ghee.
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000 And you can actually use parts of the ghee to choke people.
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000 And you can use parts of the ghee to,
01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000 make a person off balance called a sweep and get on top.
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:24.000 You can literally take the lapel of their ghee and put it between their legs and wrap it around your leg and then grab the ghee there.
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000 And then you just swing your hips and it's going to pull them off balance.
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000 Now this is something you could literally never do in the street.
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.000 So that's what they're talking about when they're talking about sport versus self defense.
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000 And they have this with other things.
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000 I mean, there's sport shooting where they do certain.
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.000 And it's semi-realistic, just like Jiu Jitsu, semi-realistic when you go in a tournament,
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000 it's somewhat simulate a street fight,
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:54.000 just like some shooting competitions somewhat simulate combat,
01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000 but they're not exact.
01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.000 And so the question is, does the sport translate onto the street?
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.000 And my answer to that is, first of all, yes, it does.
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:16.000 Not every move certainly, and there's absolutely moves that you would do in Jiu Jitsu in a tournament that you would never do on the street.
01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:22.000 Now luckily, anybody who's good enough to do those advanced moves in a tournament is good enough that in the street.
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000 They're not going to need those moves.
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000 You're not going to need to do a reverse, oh my plaza in the street.
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:34.000 You're not going to need to do donkey guard in the street.
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000 You're not going to need to do barimbollo in the street.
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000 You're just not going to need to do it.
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000 If you're fighting someone that's good, well then guess what?
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000 I guess you did need it, but you're not going to come up against a person in the street.
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000 That's going to have a counter to your barimbollo attack.
01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000 And you don't have a guillain, so that's not going to work.
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000 I mean, there are some no guivers that the bottom line is.
01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:00.000 If you're doing Jiu Jitsu, you're definitely going to do very, very well in a street fight.
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:08.000 Now that being said, that being said, sometimes you know what you got to do.
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000 You got to train Jiu Jitsu for the street.
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000 You got to punch each other occasionally.
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000 You got to say, hey, you know what?
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000 Let's go live a little bit and we'll do some maybe you put gloves on, maybe you put MMA gloves on,
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000 maybe just use open hands and you smack each other.
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.000 And you realize like, oh, when I'm on the bottom in the half guard,
01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:30.000 where I feel super comfortable when I'm doing Jiu Jitsu, if I'm in a real fight,
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000 I'm going to be getting headbutted or I'm going to be getting punched in the face.
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000 And that's not good.
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000 So what do I do to get out of this?
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:42.000 Um, you know, even in the guard can be horrible on the bottom.
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000 And you don't want to be on the bottom anyways in the fight.
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000 You don't want to, you don't, the bottom line is you don't want to grapple if you don't have to.
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000 You don't want to be in a street fight in the first place.
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000 The reason you're in a street fight is because you could not avoid it.
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000 That's why you're in a street fight.
01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000 You could not avoid it.
01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000 You got attacked.
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000 You got taken down to the ground.
01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.000 Because even if someone swings at you, you can get still get away from you.
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000 They haven't grabbed you yet. Run away.
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000 Cool.
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:14.000 So train Jiu Jitsu with punches, also train boxing more time wrestling.
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:17.000 And also work on some real scenarios.
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000 Work on the headlock.
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:25.000 And I've seen this where you get a guy that's really just coming to the game and jump straight.
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:31.000 You know, these young kids, they come to the game and they start the first thing they want to learn is the rubber guard.
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.000 The first thing they want to learn is the umo plot of the first thing they want to learn is the baron bolo.
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000 That's like the first thing they want to learn.
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000 And literally someone will put them in a headlock and they won't know what to do.
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000 Because it's different.
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000 Just like a baron bolo requires to neck technique.
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000 The headlock escape requires some technique to get out of that.
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:58.000 So work on that, work on the bear hug, work on the arm grab and the wrist grab and the the the straight arm choke.
01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.000 And big looping punches that you're going to see and I'll tell you sometimes Dean will teach yourself the fence class.
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.000 And when Dean teaches yourself the fence class every time he teaches one I learned something.
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:14.000 I'm like man, that's a good little technique he just showed how to get out of this, how to get out of that.
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:24.000 So bottom line, yes, you can it it sport Jiu Jitsu for the most part,
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:34.000 the most part, the trams lights into the street and if you're good enough at sports Jiu Jitsu that you're competing at a high level even purple belt nup.
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000 You're not going to need to use any sports Jitsu moves in the street.
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000 You're going to be destroying someone in a street fight.
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:40.000 Yeah.
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000 If you end up in that situation.
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:52.000 Yeah, the it's a spec especially now just like how are you saying the Jiu Jitsu has evolved and kind of mutated more in in the gyms now.
01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000 Yeah, a Petri dish.
01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.000 Jiu Jitsu is like in a Petri dish.
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000 It's growing.
01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000 It just grows on its own.
01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000 It turns this weird fungus and it gets all different looking.
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:00.000 Yeah.
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.000 And it does look different.
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:01.000 Yeah.
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000 It does look different than it did.
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.000 You know, even like I remember I remember Dean when I were talking about the other day we remember when the
01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000 Uma plot I came out.
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:16.000 You know, I think it was you know like 1996 we started seeing the Uma plot and we were oh man.
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000 And it looks very fancy.
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000 Yeah.
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000 It looks very because a fancy looking move.
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000 Yeah.
01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:27.000 And now now because the internet because so many people are it's exploding how rapidly it's changing and mutating.
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000 It's mutating faster now than it ever has.
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000 Yeah.
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000 Yeah.
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000 And that's it's part of the beauty of it.
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000 I think in, you know, in most ways.
01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000 The it's a spectrum.
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000 No right.
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:43.000 If you went from one side, which is just the basic the original basic, you know, take down Mount
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:49.000 Side Mount card all this all the way to worm guard something that that we're very
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000 stable for example, we're so smart.
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000 You do it.
01:58:52.000 --> 01:59:02.000 If you want to narrow it down, it's it's it's if it's something where the moves or whatever you're doing is dependent on the sport elements of it.
01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000 So it's dependent that you have a mat.
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000 It's dependent that you have a key and a belt.
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:13.000 So if you do worm guard, that's highly dependent on the guy having a key with the lapel out.
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.000 And eventually someone's going to figure out how to do worm guard without it.
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000 They'll figure out some variation for sure.
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.000 Yeah, yeah, so it's your keenens working on it.
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:27.000 So it's like, you know, just to kind of put it into defined terms.
01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:41.000 So self defense, I think now is you may find a gym that's only does sport where if you came in no experience and then, you know, three, four, five years later,
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000 your sport you did to might not take you very far in the street.
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:49.000 It's it'll be rare, I think, but you could probably find the school like that.
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:54.000 I don't know where they are, but but I think just like how you're saying, when you make it to purple belt,
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:58.000 you're the basic jujitsu will win on the street.
01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:03.000 And really, when if you go to a school like even the original Gracie Academy of Torrance, if you go there,
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:11.000 the self the self defense pursuit in jujitsu is more of it is it's tactic based like mentally.
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:17.000 It's not specific moves, it's distance management, it's where your mindset is.
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:25.000 In the guard your your pursue your goal in the guard is way different than in a tournament or something.
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000 They won't they'll say don't even go for a submission's right there.
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000 It's not your job to do submissions right here.
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000 I was going to say that you said it's dependent on the ghee.
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000 It's to sport you just depend on the ghee, dependent on the mat.
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.000 It's also dependent on the rules and it's dependent on an opponent that knows jujitsu.
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.000 Yeah, it's dependent on somebody that knows what they're doing because they're going to counter what you're doing and it'll make something work.
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000 Absolutely right. Yeah.
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:51.000 So if you go back to the self defense, you're going to be learning basically how to protect yourself,
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000 given what jujitsu is.
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.000 That's that's it. In sport, you're going to be learning how to score points,
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:05.000 how to control a certain guy with this specific uniform, how to utilize that uniform, how to utilize the mat.
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.000 That's another thing that's messed up like in the IBJJF, so the official rules of jujitsu.
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:13.000 There's some things that you're not allowed to do.
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000 Right. And that's not good. They should allow these things.
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000 Right. In regards to pursuing self defense.
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:20.000 Yes.
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000 The sport, the sport is a sport. Really when it comes down to it.
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000 Yeah, I guess you can put whatever rules you want.
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:25.000 Yeah.
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000 But you shouldn't.
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000 Yeah.
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:34.000 Yeah. If you, if you don't mind the deviation from self defense, if you don't mind that,
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000 you can put whatever rules you want. But yeah, I would say you shouldn't.
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:43.000 If you care about the more rules you put in the sport of which it's the less effective it becomes.
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.000 Unfortunately. That's what they need to stop with the rules.
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:46.000 Yeah.
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000 And it's the same thing with jujudo, it's the same thing with wrestling.
02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:56.000 I mean wrestling in America, if they allowed submission holds in wrestling in America,
02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.000 you know, America would be insane with fighters.
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:03.000 We've done pretty good. But can you imagine if every high school kid that wrestled new out of do all submissions?
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.000 To be nuts. That's a way it should be. I wish it was that way.
02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000 I wish the world was that way.
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000 It would be a better place.
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000 But what they did is what they did is with wrestling.
02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:18.000 They took submission holds out because they considered it to be dangerous.
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:18.000 Yeah.
02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.000 In judo as a clock is a classic example where they remove the double leg.
02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.000 Like you can't do a straight double leg in a tournament anymore.
02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.000 You have to set it up. It has to be off something else because
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:34.000 wrestlers will come in and dominating in judo tournaments just hit and double legs because they're, because they're awesome at them.
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:34.000 Right.
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.000 And it's the same thing now you see with with jujitsu and IBJJF.
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000 There, you know, with the with the no heal hooks.
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:43.000 Yeah.
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000 Even at a black belt level, you're not allowed to do heal hooks.
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000 That completely changes some parts of the games.
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:53.000 And it doesn't change in where it would's going to make you lose in a street fight.
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000 But it definitely puts a stop to the to the growth of the sport in terms of technique.
02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000 Yeah.
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000 Yeah. Exactly. So exactly what you're saying now.
02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:09.000 The sport, the rules and stuff. All that does is is narrow down the sport part of it.
02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000 And the more people who pursue it for sport, not just sport, but sport.
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000 If pursuing judo to the first sport is part of your game is part of your goals or whatever.
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:24.000 And then now the sport has become this limited thing where you can't like this 20% of moves you can't do.
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000 You're going to spend way less than practicing them.
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:32.000 You'd be way less effective at these moves that are a part of grappling a huge part of grappling ultimately.
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000 So, so yeah, you're still going to have that huge overlap.
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000 For sure. If you know mount, which is probably the first thing you would have your first judo class.
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.000 You're going to learn mount, which is theoretically the most dominant position you can have.
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:50.000 So you're going to learn mount, what to do when the guy flips you over, what to do in the guard, how to function.
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.000 You know, these things, that's what's going to get you by industry.
02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:58.000 That's what's going to make you effective in an actual fight.
02:03:58.000 --> 02:03:59.000 Yeah.
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:05.000 And then, you know, like anything, all these offsuits that grow, you know, they, you know, there's some overlap for sure.
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000 But if you go in an tournament, that's a specific pursuit.
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000 If you want to defend yourself, that's a specific pursuit.
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000 Now, and as time goes on, they're going to start to draw out.
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000 There's a lot of overlap right now.
02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000 Yes.
02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000 And in the future, there'll be less.
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000 Yes.
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.000 As the way that they're putting rules over the sport.
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:26.000 Yeah.
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000 And just, and just sport in general.
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.000 And the sport mutating.
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:30.000 Yeah.
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.000 Yeah.
02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000 So, you know, the sport depending on the, depending on the fact that there's a mat.
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:38.000 Like if you try to do a bar and bow in the street with chaos on the road or something.
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000 Or just the way that you make it, when you spin on the mat.
02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000 Yeah.
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000 Which friction on the street would be definitely not what would make it hard.
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000 Yes.
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000 You can put even the grass would make it hard.
02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000 Yeah.
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000 I haven't tried to bear them both on the street.
02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000 I can't get a fight.
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000 Yeah.
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000 But both are good.
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.000 I think it's fun.
02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:59.000 You can't help but really like, because, because when you go in due to your, like,
02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000 Okay, this is basically a fight.
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.000 Yeah.
02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000 And we can train full speed and be safe.
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000 It's a fight.
02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:08.000 That's what makes it so fun because the, when you win, the payoff is so good on the inside.
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000 And when you lose it's like, you still get that detriment that's still,
02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000 you still have that feeling, but at the end of the day, you know, you lived.
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.000 You're not enemies with the guy.
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.000 You're not injured.
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.000 Nothing like that.
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000 So it makes it this, this win win the whole time, right?
02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.000 And when you see a cool move like warm guard, when like, you're controlling one guy with your weird foot,
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000 that face this way in one hand.
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000 And the guy can't, like, even stand up.
02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.000 Yeah.
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.000 That's so fun.
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000 Yeah.
02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000 It's like, oh, I have a superpower on wielding, you know, in the mat.
02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000 So you can't help but pursue those fun.
02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000 Think bar and bow.
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000 You get it's like your a break dancer doing some cool stuff.
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000 Meanwhile, you're dominating the guy while you're doing.
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000 You can't help but do that stuff.
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000 So fun, you know.
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000 Yeah.
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.000 So you can't, I mean, I don't think you can really hate on the sport.
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.000 No, I don't.
02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000 I don't hate on the sport.
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:48.000 Yeah.
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000 You can't.
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000 No, no, no, no, no, no.
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.000 I'm saying good, but some people do.
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:52.000 Yeah.
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000 You know how, even just the question cut, not that the person who has this question,
02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000 thinks this, but it implies that there is a little bit of a climate of, oh, yeah.
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000 I got to say this.
02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000 If you don't like the bar and bow, we'll learn to defend against it.
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000 No, yeah.
02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000 You know what I mean?
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000 You don't like rubber guard cool learn to defend against it.
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000 That's my opinion because if you're working, then credit.
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000 You know, you either affected or ineffective.
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000 My brother, late, Babon said, oh.
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:24.000 I think the time is, yeah, it's 21 more or one more.
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000 Okay.
02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:32.000 Jocco, a lot of your advice applies to leading yourself, not just leading others.
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000 Self-help, quote unquote, is a loaded word.
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000 So let's say self-management.
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:45.000 What is the one change readers should make today to start improving themselves and their situation?
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:48.000 I don't really like those words.
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:53.000 Self-help or self-management or self-improvement.
02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000 I don't really like what those words have come to mean these days.
02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000 Because there's a lot of people out there that are constantly trying to improve themselves.
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:09.000 By looking for the one change, the one change, right?
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:15.000 The one change in their life that's going to make their dreams come true.
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:19.000 And even worse, on top of that, there's a lot of people out there.
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:32.000 A lot of self-help gurus and these hyperactive motivational speakers and these other self-appointed modern Zen yoga warriors that they're trying to sell the one thing.
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:42.000 They're trying to sell the nine steps or the enlightened path that's going to allow you to unlock all of your human potential and fulfill the dreams.
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:48.000 So you can live the life that you've always wanted to live.
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000 Now, I'm no guru.
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000 And I definitely don't claim to be.
02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000 I'm just a man.
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:03.000 But I will tell you this. It isn't one thing.
02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.000 And it isn't ten things. And it isn't a hundred things.
02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:12.000 It is an a quick path and there are no shortcuts.
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000 Meditation won't get you there.
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:23.000 And neither will a miracle drug or an organic supplement or some superfood.
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:31.000 Getting better is an hack or a trick or a one change that you need to make.
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000 Getting better is a campaign.
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:40.000 It's a campaign. It's a daily, a weekly, it's an hourly fight.
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:47.000 An insessing fight that doesn't stop against weakness and against temptation and against laziness.
02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000 It's a campaign of discipline.
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.000 The campaign of hard work and dedication.
02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:59.000 It's waking up early and going to bed late and grinding out every second in between.
02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.000 Every single day.
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:08.000 So you want to get better?
02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.000 You want to self-improve.
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:19.000 Stop looking for a shortcut and go find your alarm clock and find your discipline.
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:28.000 And think your guts and your passion and your drive and find you will.
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:39.000 And then you will find your freedom.
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.000 And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:48.000 So all you troopers out there.
02:09:48.000 --> 02:10:00.000 I don't know if I'm finding against evil or fighting against crime or fighting against fires or fighting to make things happen.
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:07.000 Fighting to get ahead and make something out of this little bit of time that we've got.
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:12.000 Thanks for joining us in the fight.
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.000 If you want to keep the conversation going, you can find us on the inner webs.
02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.000 I'm at Jocco-Willink and Echo is at Echo Charles.
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:27.000 And if you want to support the podcast, Echo is going to tell you how.
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000 Just a few ways.
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:40.000 Easy as way.
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.000 You click on there and then you do shopping.
02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:48.000 Whether you buy a book or whatever or some batteries or some duct tape.
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:55.000 Also, there is a Jocco store where you can get shirts or coffee mugs or stickers.
02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:00.000 You can support us by doing that if you like the shirts.
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000 If not, then obviously not.
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:08.000 And if you want to take some supplements, I recommend the good ones, the ones that actually work.
02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000 And those are made by on it.
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:17.000 So if you go to onit.com slash Jocco, you can get 10% off all supplements.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000 Tell people what you think.
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:38.000 You can also get a book called Extreme Ownership that was written by myself and my brother,
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000 Lave Babin.
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:44.000 And you can get it on digital hardcover.
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:51.000 You can get it on audio, which is actually read by Lave Babin and myself.
02:11:51.000 --> 02:12:00.000 And when you get done, support in the podcast and supporting the cause here,
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:09.000 go out there and do something to support yourself to make yourself better,
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:18.000 get out there into the world and get after it.
02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:24.000 And so, until next time, this is Jocco, Neko.
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:49.000 Out.
