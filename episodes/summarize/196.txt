not but he named me problem because he'd taken a shower afterwards that's a present of the fucking country and they get the times later he said looking at Packer on his on his years in service when he was in office and if he had just permitted treatment to be so on 350,000 so the Africans would still be alive and nothing new or times in editorial and that is the place for sitting anyway that's what motivated me there this is how you described in the book it was hard to comprehend the magnitude of the suffering there it's hard to imagine a place we're going to the toilet can be fatal a place where there's roughly one flush toilet for every 17,000 people a place that is largely ignored by those with the power to improve those conditions and the absence of government leadership on the AIDS issue rumor and superstition has taken over one rumor said that condoms had worms in them a sitting president of South Africa endorsed the rumor that post-coidal shower could prevent AIDS the minister of health went on to went to the world's aid conference promoting the rumor that garlic and lemon juice were effective treatments and that heart which is highly active anti-retro viral treatment was more dangerous than AIDS but the worst rumor of all the one that once again made me pause to choke back tears at the podium delivering another report was the rumor that sex with a virgin could cure AIDS this had sparked an epidemic of infant rape researching my report has sat down with a member of one family whose baby was essentially brain dead following a gang rape there were instances of four and five year olds who'd already been raped many times and at least one case the rapist of a five year old was let off the ground that his victim was not a virgin see that's an illustration when I get carried away like we just did that you look into that analyzing it and read it is better than my gang I saw it just started I'm almost the incoherent and I'll be like hey what if they never heard a psychological warfare they don't know what that is still sounding cool still don't know what it is soon saying so you gotta find the what he called the shikotomi medium balance thing also don't forget about flip side canvas dot com where you have Dakota Meyer who is making graphic representations that will get inside your brain and keep you honed and on the path of discipline and will flip side canvas dot com nothing else needs to be set on that one those those good uh and true by the way also don't forget about on it on it dot com slash jockel this where you can get your kettlebells your rings your clubs maces battle ropes all kinds of fitness equipment typical stuff and a typical you like that you get a lot of stuff I said it also this immune one shroom tech immune Yeah, I mean that's a Pat Tellman and again, this is the, the, the horrible situation, you know, it's a horrible situation, as dark you're maneuvering through enemy territory, you're expecting to get contacted and, you know, if you're not paying attention, this is why there's such a heavy burden on leadership, because it's a leadership that has to try and track these things and keep and make sense of what's going on in the battlefield and if a, a millisecond goes by and you lose that control, which, which happens, you've got to set yourselves up, so you prevent this sort of situations and it's, it's a nightmare and this is one of the, in my opinion, is one of the worst things in the war is friendly fire, because there's, it's absolutely, you know, trying to explain this is so hard, because people don't understand how confusing and complex these things are as they unfold. I think so I told him after the meeting I contact contacted Margaret J. husband Dr. Michael All Adler he surmised that I had a minor stroke the good kind of stroke if there is such a thing he told me to get to a hospital right away I found all this more than a little upsetting I wanted to get back to Christine and the boys at once so I did what was apparently one of the worst things imaginable for a stroke survivor to do I hopped on a series of flights lasting 24 hours the doctor in the state scolded me for flying and told me I was lucky to be alive he ran tests wrote prescriptions and advised me to stay away from the great pleasures the three great pleasures of my old age tennis red wine and Viagra hearing the doctor's advice I was transported back to 1942 I remembered sitting in a waiting room at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore I could hear my father's voice through the door to the doctor's office after you just been told that the best he could live with to do to live with multiple scrocess was to cut out martinis golf and his pipe I will never forget his response do you expect me to live in a vacuum tube he said I looked at the doctor have a nice day it's it's actually not that hard you can find us on the inner webs we're on twitter we're on instagram and we're on the on the on fashin echo is that echo Charles and i am at jockelwillink and thanks once again to Charles daily to his son Charlie to his wife Christine that was here thanks chalk for your service in the Marine Corps and in so many other marine arenas out there and as a veteran of the forgotten war the so called forgotten war i assure you that you and your comrades are not forgotten and the rest of the troops out there in uniform thanks to you all as well for putting on that uniform and for protecting us from evil around the world and to all the police in the law enforcement and the firefighters and the paramedics and the EMTs and the dispatchers and the correctional officers and the border patrol and secret service and all the first responders out there thank you for protecting us from evil here at home and to everyone else that's listening which got to hear a story of a amazing life the life of Charles and daily a life that still be in lift from a book that is literally still being written just like life and think about that think about think about that life with so many stories and so much life good stuff there's also a bunch of books I wrote a new book it's called the leadership strategy and tactics field manual this is the absolute frontline pragmatic information of how to lead you got a little problem here's how you actually solve that problem by following these actions that's called leadership strategy and tactics field manual it is available for pre order right now and if you want to get that first the dish you better do it quick because you got guys like Andrew Paul who ordered 20 copies get guarantees Sarah Armstrong's order in 20 copies jpg ordered eight copies he's probably going to step it up to 20 though it's so many years this jpg is competitive because of one of them so we also got extreme ownership and that academy leadership the two books that are wrote with my brother-lave batman about leadership and how to take leadership from the battlefield and apply it to your business that you're running right now we got echelon front our leadership consultancy we saw problems to leadership that's we do echelon front dot com for details on that ef online this is online leadership training so that you can so that you can get consistent repetitive and get the reps in like you just talked about getting the reps and get the reps and you have to make leadership decisions during that training by the way I don't know if you know that but AIDS in South Africa was death pointless agony and cruelty like nothing I'd ever seen these people weren't combatants they were simply victims of an unlucky birth even more unlucky than the civilians than the civilian victims of war I found their pain to be overwhelming war may have prepared me to witness such pain without looking away but nothing could have prepared me to understand it I was 72 years old when I started going to South Africa and I turned 80 shortly after my final trip more than once I was asked what were you thinking why did I take up field work and reporting in a dangerous place when I could have been golfing and napping maybe I had one more battle in me maybe I just don't know how to stay out of it when I see suffering on a personal level I knew that it felt better to observe to be somewhere I could work with brave and dedicated whom I admired the way I had admired Gunner Docey and Kenny O'Donnell and finally Dr. Eric Go Merr and these are the Dr. Eric Go Merr's that one that you were describing so so the reason I did that or we the reason we put your did your face like that or whatever is because when you're saying that like you give off a certain feeling you know like even when you say a bunch of stuff you give off a certain feeling so like as a person listening to it it's like what feeling am I getting I see what you're saying and I even see here how you say I dig it man and they said if we did it with enough force and it swamped you and at least we could stay on the end of this thing and so that was unbeknownst to the US but the, but the generals also said they were so afraid of another amygdala landing that they spent a little bit of time to take care of attack up from, sort of, and late May to the end of April and so I knew how they should end of that and the second, the first time we were running around loose but just later on there was intrigued by that and by the forehocity of this and then as usual we did our little circle around ourselves, defend ourselves and the second-hour division disappeared and the public army are okay, division and the other side of the disappearance of their work, they wouldn't sound serious but not impossible but so that was the background thing I think that we've, it's sticked out in the manuscript but laterally multiple levels multiple facets that's good about the thing that's good is would you do to will not just help you with your jiu-jitsu correct you do will help you with all aspects all aspects people on a daily basis start jiu-jitsu and let us know let me know let you know that they started jiu-jitsu 97% of the time they say I started and then you see something close to it you're gonna be more apt to recognize it in the real world then if you just saw it in a movie scenario one time right correct 100% that's totally true um also we got the mustard shikago done it sold out Denver coming up next but guess what it sold out after that December 4th and 5th in Sydney Australia that is the next monster that we're doing extreme ownership dot com for details if you want to come please register now don't wait until it sold out and then send me a twitter that says didn't know you were coming sorry can you still get me in because guess what I can't the fire marshal won't allow it also we have EF Overwatch we're taking proven leaders from spec ops and combat aviation and placing them into companies that need leadership in the civilian sector go to EF Overwatch dot com if you're on either end of that calculus whether you need a leader or whether you are a leader go to efoverwants dot com so we can connect you together and if you want to communicate more with us I'm gonna remember it's been it honor thank you very much and Charles daily has left the building and that just a FYI that we were reading off of a menu script for a book so it's out there not sure what Charlie which is Charles's son Chuck Son and they've got that that man just scripted out there but they have it's it's a well obviously recovered a little part of it the lot bigger lots of stuff in there it's sort of felt like a forest gump scenario you know like just wild things What he said he said what do you want to be at the other five years said I know exactly what I'm going to be five years what I am the day I won't fucking man but anyway, it was a massive, massive accumulation of forces, 700,000 or about a farmer than before and they moved it down and they, this is the whole, I don't, I can tell you what we got them and it assembled that force and they had, later on, quite recently, even in Marine Corps history didn't have it, there's a professor of Korean North America, American, Korean professor in Virginia, with some I got a hold of the post in the war still on, but the post battle thing with quite recently got old and they were the conversations between Mao and his generals and he had decided that the only way to stop this or bring a stalemate about it or whatever, was to have massive, massive attack and so he accumulated these troops so that problem was, and he knew it, they needed some additional training they were taking from China and SON and they were exhausted and they, and it's similar to trained And a bit of an okay leave that alone, but the fact came out that there was shot by his own man, but totally by our, Yeah, it was a, and the fact remains that he wanted to go and do something real country, put the football down, put the other helmet on and it is, his own kill them, but you start telling the people at home, who know them or another who knew of them or others who didn't know it at all, that this heroic remit or I'm given the fucking silver star and let it go. hey you know you got a you know there's this situation when you're going to do you gonna set in and I'm oversimplifying the scenario for sure you're gonna blame someone you're gonna take blame or you're gonna take blame within excuse kind of kind of options but thank you obviously for coming on the podcast and and more important you know thanks thanks for your service to our great country thanks for my citizenship check that's right the Irishman uh and thanks for what you did after the military thanks for your service in government and thank you for what you did not just for this country but for countries around the world like what you did in South Africa to try and help there and to try and do your best in your life to end suffering in the world is been an honor to sit down and talk with you and I thank you for coming on you too anyway I got an origin main dot com that's where you can get this stuff also supplements these are important supplements though they're not the kind that like the guy at the local gym it's trying to pedal to you it's made like 90% of chalk it's not that it's like the furrow one that that not only do they actually work and that's good about the reps too because you know like because a big part of what you kind of can't teach even any like you can't teach this part of it even like I guess in you just you kind of can I mean, I could see, a guy like, like, Lime, the way you described, okay, I'm going to make JFK look, you can't be weak here, you know, trying to get him from that angle. I explained it in the legend was you concur as if you have sex with a virgin and they were widespread practice of raping very young girls in some cases killing them but one was defended by somebody said if they were there wasn't a crime because she wasn't a virgin age five and this is a shit that we're putting up with since we met yesterday afternoon now 600 South African mostly women in children and died of AIDS and we don't do shit about it and I described some of the deaths including one who had described in a previous session brave and smart young and so on and she was raped the previous week by turned out 15 young guys one is 15 years of age and when she screamed out the stop that that shit is a killer and that's the one you have the volunteers type of own and so I made me that advisor and we funded but we could do we changed our editorial boards employees included blacks we had condoms in our workplaces one priest had said in the our pop we'll tell you that a country or evil and he talked as if raincoats cause rain You know, it all feels like that's what the hit, but my World War I, one of the Charlie's said, you know, I played the game yesterday. yeah you could tell a lot of it was was affected from the beginning who good you've also been making little excerpts excerpts some of them are just a straight excerpts occasionally you enhance the excerpts with things like cello music sometimes explosions sometimes fire smoke reflections causes in my facial expressions why would you do that you're just like I'm gonna freeze your facial expression at this time and if you're going to train jiu-jitsu you're going to need a geet yep because we do recommend geet and no geet jiu-jitsu do different things I think is time goes on they become more and more like different from each other which in my opinion is more of reason to do both okay come on back in the day but there's like obvious choice versus like kind of ridiculous choice you know it's like that kind yeah then you can check out the YouTube channel called joccopotcast also we have psychological warfare which is little audio clips that can help you through challenging moments of weakness that threaten your very existence every single day you can go to iTunes Google Play or other MP3 platforms to download these fire support for your ears you know what you know what it's just go off script And now you know, where in the war, you got your dad at this point, he goes to a doctor, goes to the doctor, because he's getting dizzy, and you know, having some spells of dizzyness and whatnot. well it's these the kind of thing that can make you think you're rationally and and here's what you say in here I don't think any anything can prepare someone to understand that kind of suffering I don't think that kind of suffering can be understood some of my family and friend saw straight line between war in my field work in South Africa perhaps I was continuing my search for a sense of purpose and mission seeking once again the company of people who live heroically maybe but this is what it is when you're so came in and you're talking about the one that you're saying um you know what the trump card like you want to go drink you're rather than trained than I don't want you to know maintain you know three percent of the time maybe even less than that I've only had I can only think of two people that actually they're like I just don't like it I read the reader like a boy's car which I got thrown out of fucking boy's car and I said I know this. So you're living that life, you're like I said, you're pretty happy at that point and then going to the book on June 25, 1950, we got our national emergency. but you thought it looked good that's good right you thought it looked good looking at t-shirts that had long sleeves in her hood that's it looked like Thus negating our biggest technological advantage is not something that, you know, if you're going to get to force that has air control and artillery, you get as close to you can't, we call it hugging, hugging the enemy, you know, you, they want to get so close to us that we can't call for fire. and he said I'm alive but he said I'm ashamed that I'm alive and since I'm fucking mess and thought the more you can spell it out and the more you can save these guys they're kind of damn pressure to the country and Becky said he did have sex with the woman as the lead to rape or So when things got worse, he's little guy and I was, he looked like a fucking Lebanese immigrant, whatever they looked like. Oh, yeah, you gotta point that out, because not too many people know what it's like to be at sea these days. we were little bit of us all right subscribe to the podcast to be done already iTunes group of places that you're wherever leave reviews if you want us to read them and get a good laugh out of your awesome review also don't forget about the warrior kid podcast which is also available and good for kids parents teachers adults human beings and there's some more your kids soap you can get from irish oaks ranch dot com which is a young warrior kid making soap that you allows you to stay clean yeah it's actually at the end of the day I mean it's a few origin ones have a jody medic one that I always wear this is pretty much all I'm wearing approved yeah rash guards rash guards on their big time truckers hats you know beanie's dry fit dry fit is there being produced
