00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.80 This is Jockel Podcast number 331 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening, Echo. Good evening.
00:00:06.80 --> 00:00:16.000 Also joining us for the back-to-back episodes, Ben Milligan, author of the book by Water, Beneath the Walls.
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.50 If you haven't listened to podcast 330, go back and listen to that one if you really want to start at the beginning of the Ben Milligan experience.
00:00:24.50 --> 00:00:42.50 Then you gotta go back and listen to 298 Ben Milligan, former seal teammate of mine who has written this incredible book about the history of special operations and how from this convoluted,
00:00:42.50 --> 00:01:00.50 distorted history, there ends up being this random group of men from the Navy that become the go anywhere, commando of choice for the military.
00:01:00.50 --> 00:01:05.50 So, there you go. Ben. Well said. Thanks for coming back, man.
00:01:05.50 --> 00:01:21.50 Better than I could. So we got barely in three hours on the last podcast. We got through World War II in this convoluted crazy story of hits and misses of surfaces and gaps.
00:01:21.50 --> 00:01:29.50 And we're going to roll into now the post-war period. Post-war, career.
00:01:29.50 --> 00:01:39.50 When I was writing the book, I really didn't want to have a book that was half World War II and half everything else but it's kind of out of it.
00:01:39.50 --> 00:01:43.50 No, we just had enough with a podcast that's half World War II and then half World War II.
00:01:43.50 --> 00:01:53.50 How can you not though? When I was thinking about it, I cover six chapters on World War II and then there's nine chapters of everything else.
00:01:53.50 --> 00:02:05.50 But the third of the book is World War II and justify it, and World War II is everything else that we have ever, most horrible war in history.
00:02:05.50 --> 00:02:11.50 And in my World War II section it covers six different theaters of operation.
00:02:11.50 --> 00:02:17.50 So it makes sense that it would. So I don't feel as bad about it when I set out.
00:02:17.50 --> 00:02:35.50 Yeah. All right. So let's jump into chapter seven, which is the US Navy's post war plate and the sailor Raiders who led her back to significance in Korea.
00:02:35.50 --> 00:02:45.50 We'll continue. You can see we continue Ben with his long-winded chapter titles. So there's only even subtitles, right? They're the actual chapter title.
00:02:45.50 --> 00:02:51.50 Each chapter title is the chapter one. That's the chapter title. And then the subtitle is that.
00:02:51.50 --> 00:02:57.50 Yeah, because this chapter could have been called chapter seven, post war.
00:02:57.50 --> 00:03:07.50 And my defense, I had much tighter chapter titles until my editor got a hold of these. I like how you're taking ownership of that. I like how you're blaming your editor.
00:03:07.50 --> 00:03:15.50 It is not the person's fault. I have your like my chapter titles. And for some of these, I spent more time writing the chapter title.
00:03:15.50 --> 00:03:29.50 Trying to compress 30 years of a chapter into a single sentence. I mean, you're doing the absolute best that you can. One, give your reader some idea of what's about to what they're about to undertake.
00:03:29.50 --> 00:03:35.50 But two, you don't want to give away anything. You don't want to say like, I mean, I think the only chapter that I really give away.
00:03:35.50 --> 00:03:47.50 I sort of, I give you some foreshadowing. You know, the raid that wasn't the chapter on the rangers. You have some sense that this isn't going to go the way that they think it's going to go.
00:03:47.50 --> 00:04:03.50 And then, too, the first chapter on the raiders, the rise and the violent demise of the Navy's first raiders. You're kind of, you're giving your reader like a little taste of what's about to come.
00:04:03.50 --> 00:04:17.50 And I know I can be a little bit of a, what is it a dart throw from the back of the room about your, about your titles and stuff, but as I said, and this book is phenomenal.
00:04:17.50 --> 00:04:30.50 This book is, is when I, when I read through this book, look, the details amazing, but you're a fracking hell of a writer too. It's funny.
00:04:30.50 --> 00:04:37.50 There's the, the things that you capture the things that you call out, the dialogue that you've selected and what's cool is the dialogue that you've selected.
00:04:37.50 --> 00:04:44.50 This is dialogue that's documented. This isn't like your authors. You don't do that anywhere in the book. You don't do anywhere in the book.
00:04:44.50 --> 00:04:52.50 You do the, you know, this is basically what was said. You don't do that anywhere. Do you? It's all, this is what was actually said recorded in this document.
00:04:52.50 --> 00:05:00.50 There's only one time where I, I try to synthesize a conversation. I think that's when I have two different, at two documents.
00:05:00.50 --> 00:05:10.50 One was Donovan's account of a conversation and then Miles is count on a conversation. And they both, you know, are sort of like confirming what the other said.
00:05:10.50 --> 00:05:15.50 That's the only time where I tried to synthesize, you know, two separate conversations.
00:05:15.50 --> 00:05:25.50 There was another time when I was synthesizing, you know, the conversation that Halon Mad Smith has with Kelly Turner about Tinian. And then there's a third
00:05:25.50 --> 00:05:36.50 account where a Draper Kaufman is listening it on this conversation. I'm trying to like do my best to like squeeze these three things into trying to relate the different perspectives and trying to come up with something.
00:05:36.50 --> 00:05:57.50 It's a little bit of a sense of, you know, something that's going to last. Essentially like agree with each other though. I mean it's like, you know, you kind of know when something's true when it doesn't exactly agree. Like if you know, your platoon commander and you know, two of your guys show up for an up and they both have black eyes, you know, like what happened last night.
00:05:57.50 --> 00:06:10.50 And if they both have the exact same story, you know, they're lying. Yeah. You know what it means though. If there's a slate if there's, you know, they both kind of rhyme with each other, but they're not exactly the same. They were just told from a different perspective.
00:06:10.50 --> 00:06:20.50 Well, it's it's an unbelievable book. It's a fantastic read and it's kind of book also you can kind of pick up. This is this is sort of in the vein of about face.
00:06:20.50 --> 00:06:29.50 Where in about face you can pick up that book and you can start to read it and in four pages three pages you go, oh, that's a good little lesson. There's something to think about.
00:06:29.50 --> 00:06:49.50 And this is this, this is the same way that this book works. Yes, absolutely read it from cover to cover, but you have it sitting on your, you know, on your nightstand and you're not quite tired yet opens book up anywhere read three or four pages and you get a little lesson, a little piece of history and also some kind of a leadership lesson.
00:06:49.50 --> 00:06:53.50 And there. So phenomenal from that perspective as well.
00:06:53.50 --> 00:06:58.50 All right, let's jump into this a little bit. So.
00:06:58.50 --> 00:07:12.50 Tell me more about the revolt of the admirals. What happened with that? So after World War II, the.
00:07:12.50 --> 00:07:37.50 Joint Chiefs or there's a there's a huge budget, you know, cut. I mean, there's nothing's ever happened like World War II and World War II like nothing's ever happened like the end of World War II where, you know, the military, the US military prior to World War II has always had this sort of cycle where they, they build up to deal with whatever conflict,
00:07:37.50 --> 00:07:49.50 the American Civil War or the first World War or the second World War. They grew from sort of a nucleus force to this massive industrial, you know, mobilized, you know, military.
00:07:49.50 --> 00:07:58.50 And then after it, you shrink back down to that nucleus force again, so you can rebuild again later after World War II.
00:07:58.50 --> 00:08:22.50 The US military or the the the US public is finally learned its lesson. We can't shrink back. You can't be in this industrial or this era of total war and not field planes and massive ships. You have to keep a residual force a float and in the air.
00:08:22.50 --> 00:08:36.50 But there's still you can't continue to spend what they were spending in World War II. So in the military shrinks drastically. So all of the military entities are competing for very limited resources.
00:08:36.50 --> 00:08:56.50 But now that all of the you know, worlds are all of the United States's enemies have been defeated. The one that still exists is the Soviet Union and planners don't expect that this is going to be a massive naval effort.
00:08:56.50 --> 00:09:14.50 The Soviet Union at that point doesn't have a you know, a particularly big navy or anything like that. We don't anticipate that we're ever going to need to land ships in the Soviet or land troops on the Soviet Union because we have this, you know, huge presence in Western Europe.
00:09:14.50 --> 00:09:26.50 So planners in the army and the air force are claiming that they need more of the resources that the navy doesn't need resources because we're never going to have amphibious warfare again.
00:09:26.50 --> 00:09:34.50 It's just just not going to happen anything that the navy could have done all the troops that the navy could have transported the air force can do it with planes.
00:09:34.50 --> 00:09:56.50 So take the money from the navy, give it to the army, give it to especially give it to the air force. So the air force and the army have convinced, you know, the most of the top decision makers in the Truman administration that they're going to, you know, pull money, you know, rather than Peter Paypal.
00:09:56.50 --> 00:10:10.50 The navy sees this prospect of what is about to be done to them, about to be done to their service. And not only are they about to lose all of this money and all of this status, but they're about to be sort of de-clothed.
00:10:10.50 --> 00:10:15.50 You know, the navy's not going to be like a force and offensive warfare force anymore.
00:10:15.50 --> 00:10:34.50 And the navy planners are, you know, they're they're panicking. Not just panicking for their service, but they realize how how difficult, how complex expeditionary warfare is and they're doing everything they can to save their service and by saving the service saved the country.
00:10:34.50 --> 00:10:51.50 So they stage essentially stage a coup. They, not a coup, but they, they start leaking pressure leaking stuff to, to the newspaper columnist.
00:10:51.50 --> 00:11:02.50 I talked about merit, merit, Edson, Red Mike, Edson, he resigns from his commission in the Marine Corps, so he can get out and start protesting publicly.
00:11:02.50 --> 00:11:09.50 Eventually, the clamor gets so bad that they have to call a committee hearing in the house in Congress.
00:11:09.50 --> 00:11:21.50 And it's, you know, for several days, it's a, it's a big to do like they, they bring in just about every admiral, every, every famous admiral from World War II to testify in front of Congress.
00:11:21.50 --> 00:11:24.50 Yeah, I got to, I got to list the names here.
00:11:24.50 --> 00:11:40.50 Lahi, Blandi, Nimitz, Halsey, Spruits, Conncade, Connly, Carnie Burke, every blue water hero, save Kelly Turner, save Kelly Turner, Faragant, John Paul Jones.
00:11:40.50 --> 00:12:00.50 That is just basically everyone you could, every pipeting, naval leader goes in and makes their case makes their case for not taking all the money away from the Navy and giving it all to the Army and primarily the Air Force.
00:12:00.50 --> 00:12:15.50 No other force and no other nation then field proclaimed could concentrate aircraft like the Navy could seize advance bases could defend those bases could promigate underseason amphibious warfare could bring to bear its underwater demolition teams.
00:12:15.50 --> 00:12:22.50 It's mine sweepers and its radio telephone operators to control air and naval gunfire.
00:12:22.50 --> 00:12:31.50 At the conclusion of Danfield testimony, a red face speechless, Matthew stood and thundered from the committee room for a moment it appeared the Navy had won.
00:12:31.50 --> 00:12:35.50 Interestingly, even mentioned that underwater demolition teams.
00:12:35.50 --> 00:12:42.50 That's I mean, they're so, I mean, important in the Navy's order of battle at that point, that absolutely they go and, you know, they grew.
00:12:42.50 --> 00:12:57.50 They say in the book, they grew from three teams to forty teams and each of these teams is a hundred, as a hundred guys, plus each one is a side its own ship and not only that, but they have a sorted.
00:12:57.50 --> 00:13:06.50 All the all the protection that each one of these teams requires almost each one gets an LCIG gunboat plus all the battleships that came with that.
00:13:06.50 --> 00:13:13.50 The UDTs have risen to the front rank of the Navy's amphibious warfare plan.
00:13:13.50 --> 00:13:16.50 So, but it fails, the whole revolt fails.
00:13:16.50 --> 00:13:18.50 And that's that.
00:13:18.50 --> 00:13:19.50 Sort of.
00:13:19.50 --> 00:13:29.50 I mean, it's that until we go until a completely unexpected event happens, the North Koreans invade the South.
00:13:29.50 --> 00:13:33.50 That's what we always need to be ready for that unexpected event.
00:13:33.50 --> 00:13:36.50 That no one, no one anticipates.
00:13:36.50 --> 00:13:52.50 One of the things that we've been doing as we've been going through this book, the second time here is talk about some of the characters that you are forced to cut out because of just the prudence and and sympathy for your readers, what you tell me.
00:13:52.50 --> 00:13:57.50 sympathy for the reader because you would, you could literally make every one of these characters its own book.
00:13:57.50 --> 00:13:59.50 So, talking about Louis A. Johnson.
00:13:59.50 --> 00:14:05.50 Louis A. Johnson is, I mean, he's he's a villain out of central casting.
00:14:05.50 --> 00:14:08.50 He's I mean, he's a total politician.
00:14:08.50 --> 00:14:13.50 He's, I think he's a West, he's a West Virginia attorney.
00:14:13.50 --> 00:14:20.50 He's a, uh, Truman's campaign director in his second campaign for office.
00:14:20.50 --> 00:14:28.50 His reward for getting to a Truman a second term is he becomes the Secretary of Defense.
00:14:28.50 --> 00:14:32.50 A position he's not particularly suited for.
00:14:32.50 --> 00:14:34.50 He doesn't have a huge military record.
00:14:34.50 --> 00:14:37.50 He did serve in the first world where I think he was a supply officer.
00:14:37.50 --> 00:14:46.50 One of the things he did one of the last things he did when he was still an active duty is a, as an army supply officer is he issued a fairly.
00:14:46.50 --> 00:14:51.50 Fairly scathing report of the sort of the army's logistics efforts.
00:14:51.50 --> 00:14:57.50 He's always kind of been, um, not an outsider, but sort of a, you know, like the guy with the flames or he just, he's just a bit like a,
00:14:57.50 --> 00:15:00.50 he does not like the institution that he was a part of.
00:15:00.50 --> 00:15:02.50 He thinks it could be run so much better.
00:15:02.50 --> 00:15:06.50 And when he sees the, um, the US military, he sees redundancies everywhere.
00:15:06.50 --> 00:15:08.50 Not just redundancies, but waste waste, waste.
00:15:08.50 --> 00:15:10.50 He wants to get rid of all of it.
00:15:10.50 --> 00:15:12.50 He wants to come in, like I said, with a blowtorch.
00:15:12.50 --> 00:15:16.50 And he wants to, he stops production of an aircraft carrier.
00:15:16.50 --> 00:15:19.50 While it's, I mean, after it's killed, is all already been laid.
00:15:19.50 --> 00:15:26.50 He's taking money from the Navy and giving it right to the Air Force, almost $400 million in one fell swoop from the Navy to the,
00:15:26.50 --> 00:15:28.50 to the Air Force.
00:15:28.50 --> 00:15:35.50 Um, he is, I say, he's a person who never saw an arm without thinking how to twist it.
00:15:35.50 --> 00:15:37.50 I don't know, my favorite lines from the book.
00:15:37.50 --> 00:15:44.50 Like he was, um, and, uh, yeah, I mean, he's, he's, he's the, he's the,
00:15:44.50 --> 00:15:48.50 uh, called, he's the, he's the, he's the, he's the villain of the Navy.
00:15:48.50 --> 00:15:50.50 He's the, he's the antagonist.
00:15:50.50 --> 00:15:54.50 He's, uh, he's the guy who sees, you know, the Navy is just a, you know, a waste of manpower,
00:15:54.50 --> 00:15:58.74 resources, the Air Force can do everything, particularly with with atomic weapons, nobody
00:15:58.74 --> 00:15:59.74 else has them.
00:15:59.74 --> 00:16:01.02 There's no more war.
00:16:01.02 --> 00:16:02.74 This is the end of history for a lot of people.
00:16:02.74 --> 00:16:04.74 They think everything's...
00:16:04.74 --> 00:16:07.62 We're done, perpetual peace.
00:16:07.62 --> 00:16:14.82 You know, when I first got into the Navy, when I was a kid, I remember at some point, you
00:16:14.82 --> 00:16:19.22 know, I got to the team because it bugs your still, in boot camp and then bugs, you're still
00:16:19.22 --> 00:16:23.82 kind of like isolated to what the Navy actually is and how it actually works, right?
00:16:23.82 --> 00:16:29.90 I remember going on my first trip at the SEAL teams and for some reason we had to like get
00:16:29.90 --> 00:16:33.26 gas for our vehicles.
00:16:33.26 --> 00:16:39.38 And we had to pay for the gas from the Navy like supply depot thing.
00:16:39.38 --> 00:16:41.38 We had a special card.
00:16:41.38 --> 00:16:46.38 And I thought, well, you think, you think just like, hey, man, it's the Navy.
00:16:46.38 --> 00:16:48.26 Like they got gas, it's Navy gas.
00:16:48.26 --> 00:16:49.66 Like we're in the Navy there in the Navy.
00:16:49.66 --> 00:16:54.74 Hey, cool, or oh, we need to fly to some other state.
00:16:54.74 --> 00:16:58.90 Cool, what the Air Force is going to pick us up and then we don't have to pay for that.
00:16:58.90 --> 00:16:59.90 They're in the Air Force.
00:16:59.90 --> 00:17:03.90 We're in the Navy, but we're all in the same big team.
00:17:03.90 --> 00:17:06.54 And you realize it's not like that at all.
00:17:06.54 --> 00:17:11.50 And that's why these budgetary discussions that happen, they're so...
00:17:11.50 --> 00:17:13.70 You wouldn't think that they would be a thing, but they're...
00:17:13.70 --> 00:17:14.70 They're nothing.
00:17:14.70 --> 00:17:19.46 So not just that they're offing, they are of nothing, and the way this money gets
00:17:19.46 --> 00:17:25.58 dived up and luckily, luckily it ends up being a...
00:17:25.58 --> 00:17:32.02 For the most part, a positive sort of competitive cycle of people trying to do good so
00:17:32.02 --> 00:17:39.70 that they can get more money, which drives better results, right?
00:17:39.70 --> 00:17:44.14 But when you talk about efficiency, like if you were to look at the military, just straight
00:17:44.14 --> 00:17:47.30 up from a pure efficiency, what is the Army have boats?
00:17:47.30 --> 00:17:49.22 Why does the Army have helicopters?
00:17:49.22 --> 00:17:51.26 Why does the Navy have helicopters?
00:17:51.26 --> 00:17:56.10 Why does the Marine Corps have fighter jets?
00:17:56.10 --> 00:17:57.10 Why...
00:17:57.10 --> 00:17:58.66 You could just say, well, this doesn't make any sense at all.
00:17:58.66 --> 00:17:59.66 This is all redundant.
00:17:59.66 --> 00:18:02.66 If you're going to have one group in charge of the sky, make it the Air Force.
00:18:02.66 --> 00:18:07.34 You make one group in charge of the ocean, make it the Navy, got one group in charge of
00:18:07.34 --> 00:18:09.70 the land, make it the Army.
00:18:09.70 --> 00:18:14.94 There's all kinds of efficiencies that you could kind of think and say, yeah, that makes
00:18:14.94 --> 00:18:15.94 some sense.
00:18:15.94 --> 00:18:22.66 But the reality is, there's these seams and the seams need to be dealt with and then you
00:18:22.66 --> 00:18:29.70 want to have in a positive way, you want to have the Marine Corps that has fighter jets,
00:18:29.70 --> 00:18:34.70 and the Navy has fighter jets, and the Air Force has fighter jets.
00:18:34.70 --> 00:18:36.90 And the Army, well, they have eight-tens.
00:18:36.90 --> 00:18:38.90 So I think that's what I'm saying.
00:18:38.90 --> 00:18:40.18 You shoot them same, but they all have...
00:18:40.18 --> 00:18:44.54 No, I mean, you're like Bradley fighting vehicles and armored vehicles.
00:18:44.54 --> 00:18:47.38 Well, one of the Army has them, but so does the Marine Corps.
00:18:47.38 --> 00:18:51.34 You just go down these lists of where these things cross over, where the efficiencies
00:18:51.34 --> 00:18:52.34 are.
00:18:52.34 --> 00:18:57.10 And so this battle that we're talking about, that's a economic battle for the various
00:18:57.10 --> 00:19:01.42 forces, is a real thing that needs to be contended with.
00:19:01.42 --> 00:19:07.34 And that's sort of another thing as we go forward, that's going to continue to drive
00:19:07.34 --> 00:19:11.66 the seals to be coming, to get created.
00:19:11.66 --> 00:19:14.66 Because as...
00:19:14.66 --> 00:19:18.26 You mentioned all of it seems like World War II was sort of the end of war for some
00:19:18.26 --> 00:19:19.26 people.
00:19:19.26 --> 00:19:28.58 Well, if you want to talk about naval battles, Navy versus Navy, it gets pretty close to
00:19:28.58 --> 00:19:33.46 say in that World War II is the end of war.
00:19:33.46 --> 00:19:34.46 But it does.
00:19:34.46 --> 00:19:38.46 For the Navy.
00:19:38.46 --> 00:19:40.46 So then what's the Navy doing?
00:19:40.46 --> 00:19:41.46 What we saw at aircraft?
00:19:41.46 --> 00:19:42.46 Okay, that's cool.
00:19:42.46 --> 00:19:46.70 But that still is one step back from the people that are on the front lines making things
00:19:46.70 --> 00:19:47.70 happen.
00:19:47.70 --> 00:19:52.50 So, I just wanted to bring that up from the perspective of where this all goes and how
00:19:52.50 --> 00:19:56.54 this all plays out.
00:19:56.54 --> 00:19:57.54 Ted Fielding.
00:19:57.54 --> 00:19:59.54 What's to do with Ted Fielding?
00:19:59.54 --> 00:20:04.42 Ted Fielding, Macboying, Georgia, and these are all characters that are UDT.
00:20:04.42 --> 00:20:09.82 Officers who are almost lost to history.
00:20:09.82 --> 00:20:11.82 They are...
00:20:11.82 --> 00:20:18.82 That first rank of Frogman that...
00:20:18.82 --> 00:20:20.66 It kind of got to go back real quick.
00:20:20.66 --> 00:20:28.94 So when Korea kicks off, Korea, the geography of Korea determines a lot.
00:20:28.94 --> 00:20:38.36 The Korea is a peninsula, it's accessible everywhere, on every coast of it, by naval
00:20:38.36 --> 00:20:41.14 guns, navy ships.
00:20:41.14 --> 00:20:51.02 But the mountains of Korea kind of preclude the highways being driven or built right
00:20:51.02 --> 00:20:52.18 down the center of the country.
00:20:52.18 --> 00:20:58.18 So most of the highways in Korea, most of the railroads in Korea, all major traffic is
00:20:58.18 --> 00:21:00.78 going to go up and down the skins of the country.
00:21:00.78 --> 00:21:07.90 So on either coast, within 15 miles of the coast, the major arteries of the country are
00:21:07.90 --> 00:21:09.86 going to be established.
00:21:09.86 --> 00:21:17.14 So when the Inmangan are the North Korean Army, when they attack, they push the South
00:21:17.14 --> 00:21:22.42 Korean military and the U.S. advisors, they push them into the little pocket down to the far
00:21:22.42 --> 00:21:26.62 south-east corner of the country, what we call the Pusan perimeter.
00:21:26.62 --> 00:21:33.54 And the North Koreans are supplying their forces that are attacking this perimeter up and
00:21:33.54 --> 00:21:40.14 down these railways that are on the flanks of the coast or on the flanks of the peninsula.
00:21:40.14 --> 00:21:46.38 So the U.S. military having disbanded, the Army Rangers having disbanded, the Army
00:21:46.38 --> 00:21:50.34 or the Marine Corps Raiders, the Marine VAC recon company, all of these special operations
00:21:50.34 --> 00:21:55.54 units that had been created in World War II, none of these units exist.
00:21:55.54 --> 00:22:03.22 And all commanders want is to start fielding something that can help cut these supply lines
00:22:03.22 --> 00:22:11.46 to the North Korean Army and the first entity to see the opportunity there and to see the
00:22:11.46 --> 00:22:15.70 good that they can be doing on that, or the commanders in the U.S. Navy.
00:22:15.70 --> 00:22:17.86 They see these, but they don't have the troops to do it.
00:22:17.86 --> 00:22:23.70 And the only troops that are in country that they have are their frogmen, the underwater
00:22:23.70 --> 00:22:26.66 demolition teams, and they've never done any missions like this.
00:22:26.66 --> 00:22:27.98 They've never gone ashore.
00:22:27.98 --> 00:22:33.14 The furthest the U.D.T.s have gone ashore are in Okinawa, a couple of guys went inland
00:22:33.14 --> 00:22:36.46 to do a handful of things, but nothing serious.
00:22:36.46 --> 00:22:43.38 So when we get to Korea, because there are no raiders, there are no Rangers, the Marine
00:22:43.38 --> 00:22:47.58 Recon are still on their way to the country.
00:22:47.58 --> 00:22:51.74 The opportunity falls to the only unit that's there, and that's a detachment of U.D.T.
00:22:51.74 --> 00:22:58.54 has gone on, and they figured out they start going ashore, and they do their, they find
00:22:58.54 --> 00:23:02.70 these real ways, and they try to blow them up with the, I mean, the, well, one thing that
00:23:02.70 --> 00:23:06.94 the U.D.T. has is a ton of explosives.
00:23:06.94 --> 00:23:07.94 We've got some bombs.
00:23:07.94 --> 00:23:08.94 They've got some bombs.
00:23:08.94 --> 00:23:15.34 I mean, I think the first raid that they actually undertake is in Yosu and it's by George
00:23:15.34 --> 00:23:23.86 Agis and Hose. He's a relatively new frog, and he's not, he wasn't a frogman in World
00:23:23.86 --> 00:23:32.54 World War II, but he's a, he's become a really good problem solver in his, you know,
00:23:32.54 --> 00:23:34.94 four-year career in the U.D.T.s.
00:23:34.94 --> 00:23:40.58 He's one of the, one of the first guys to participate in what's called the sub-ops,
00:23:40.58 --> 00:23:45.58 Platon, he, he started to, instead of being just the, the frogman who's swimming on the
00:23:45.58 --> 00:23:50.58 surface, he's, he's perfected, lockouts from submarines.
00:23:50.58 --> 00:23:52.78 He's driven underwater submersibles.
00:23:52.78 --> 00:23:58.26 So he, he, he might not be a raider or might not be somebody who's trained in, you know,
00:23:58.26 --> 00:24:02.90 inland demolition raids, but he is somebody who's adaptable, and he leads one of the first
00:24:02.90 --> 00:24:07.34 raids, a shore to, to blow up a real, a real, real way.
00:24:07.34 --> 00:24:11.34 And those subsequent guys that come in, fielding, bointing, they, they only take the U.D.
00:24:11.34 --> 00:24:12.34 Teasing further.
00:24:12.34 --> 00:24:15.34 I'm going to take it to the book on that one.
00:24:15.34 --> 00:24:21.54 Uh, below the sea wall, an out of Atchinson's view, Foley had likewise heard the
00:24:21.54 --> 00:24:26.34 hand cart, and was already splashing into the surf, his legs and arms straining against
00:24:26.34 --> 00:24:30.86 the slow motion of sucking water, and the bad dream unfolding behind him.
00:24:30.86 --> 00:24:35.14 When he reached the rubber boat, he gave a, a hushed alarm to the crew, grabbed the
00:24:35.14 --> 00:24:42.14 Tommy gun, and splashed back through the surf, swimmers lie me, Austin and McCormick, waiting
00:24:42.14 --> 00:24:44.14 behind to keep up.
00:24:44.14 --> 00:24:48.74 Under the bridge, Atchinson held his breath, waiting for an opportunity.
00:24:48.74 --> 00:24:53.50 Suddenly a shadowy figure rested the sea wall, and charged the tunnel firing a machine
00:24:53.50 --> 00:24:55.14 gun from the hip.
00:24:55.14 --> 00:25:00.70 Instinctively, both the North Koreans and Atchinson opened fire at the same target, apparently,
00:25:00.70 --> 00:25:06.18 at the same time to hear the figure yelling, hang in their L.T. omcoming.
00:25:06.18 --> 00:25:12.54 It was Foley, whether or not Atchinson realized his mistake, the flash of gunfire unfrozen.
00:25:12.54 --> 00:25:17.14 Grenade in hand, he pulled the pin and threw it toward the North Koreans, then he threw
00:25:17.14 --> 00:25:19.02 another, and another.
00:25:19.02 --> 00:25:24.26 The sequence of explosions all of unknown origin chased the North Koreans back into the
00:25:24.26 --> 00:25:25.74 tunnel.
00:25:25.74 --> 00:25:31.10 Using his moment, Atchinson tore himself from cover and sprinted to the sea wall.
00:25:31.10 --> 00:25:36.26 As soon as he reached the top of the wall, one of the arm swimmers huddled at the bottom, spotted
00:25:36.26 --> 00:25:42.66 a human head poking over the lip, and made the same mistake Atchinson had, and stitched
00:25:42.66 --> 00:25:44.62 the wall with fire.
00:25:44.62 --> 00:25:48.58 One of the rounds tore a hole in the bill of Atchinson's hat.
00:25:48.58 --> 00:25:54.50 Half a second later Atchinson identified himself, you idiot told your fire, it's me.
00:25:54.50 --> 00:26:00.42 Poked his head over again, then scraped down the wall, and onto the rocks.
00:26:00.42 --> 00:26:05.42 At the bottom, he found the rest of his men, having rolled himself away from danger and over
00:26:05.42 --> 00:26:11.42 the sea wall, Foley was now alert, but gritting his teeth, shot through the hand and
00:26:11.42 --> 00:26:15.06 thigh, a kneecap smashed by his fall.
00:26:15.06 --> 00:26:20.34 Once they were together, McCormick scooped up Foley in his arms, and everyone ran for
00:26:20.34 --> 00:26:21.70 the surf.
00:26:21.70 --> 00:26:29.94 That medium, that until this mission, the UDT, had always considered the furthest limit
00:26:29.94 --> 00:26:34.38 of their operations.
00:26:34.38 --> 00:26:35.38 So that's it.
00:26:35.38 --> 00:26:41.10 That's the first venture out of the surf zone and onto the land.
00:26:41.10 --> 00:26:52.62 Foley goes home, Foley goes to the movie The Frogman comes out a few months later,
00:26:52.62 --> 00:26:58.06 and Foley, who's recently returned from Korea, he goes to the premiere, he's wheeled up,
00:26:58.06 --> 00:27:04.94 and a wheeled chair, he gets to meet Richard Woodmark, who's the star of the show and
00:27:04.94 --> 00:27:05.94 everything.
00:27:05.94 --> 00:27:06.94 That's pretty cool.
00:27:06.94 --> 00:27:13.70 One of the few things, that would have been a totally missed episode, had I not gone to
00:27:13.70 --> 00:27:14.70 the UDTC on the museum.
00:27:14.70 --> 00:27:17.42 That's one of the walking through that thing.
00:27:17.42 --> 00:27:18.58 I think I know everything.
00:27:18.58 --> 00:27:24.22 I walked past a picture, Richard Woodmark, and Foley, damn.
00:27:24.22 --> 00:27:26.34 They did a good job on the frog, man.
00:27:26.34 --> 00:27:27.34 They really did.
00:27:27.34 --> 00:27:29.10 On the frog, yeah, the movie.
00:27:29.10 --> 00:27:31.46 They catch you some good attitudes.
00:27:31.46 --> 00:27:34.10 You're like, oh, I know these guys.
00:27:34.10 --> 00:27:40.10 The first opening 10 minutes where you're catching the attitude of these UDT guys, you're
00:27:40.10 --> 00:27:42.14 like, oh, I recognize this attitude.
00:27:42.14 --> 00:27:46.22 I freaking had to hang out with these idiots my whole life.
00:27:46.22 --> 00:27:47.86 They're really cocky.
00:27:47.86 --> 00:27:50.18 They're just getting after it.
00:27:50.18 --> 00:27:52.22 They do a good job with that.
00:27:52.22 --> 00:27:56.78 Then after you say that you're feeling now on Boint and they start pushing in and continue
00:27:56.78 --> 00:27:57.78 to push.
00:27:57.78 --> 00:27:58.78 It doesn't have operations.
00:27:58.78 --> 00:28:00.78 It doesn't happen right away.
00:28:00.78 --> 00:28:07.74 When the Marine Recon gets in country, the Marine, they create this unit special operations
00:28:07.74 --> 00:28:09.78 group or a sag.
00:28:09.78 --> 00:28:15.50 It's another one of those entities where the Marines take the front rank of it.
00:28:15.50 --> 00:28:19.06 The UDT take the subordinate role of just being in charge of the explosives.
00:28:19.06 --> 00:28:21.06 The Marines are going to go ashore.
00:28:21.06 --> 00:28:27.18 They're going to, with guns and everything like that, they're going to clear or provide
00:28:27.18 --> 00:28:31.94 a perimeter for the UDT to come ashore with explosives, set those explosives onto the railways
00:28:31.94 --> 00:28:33.50 and then they escape toward it.
00:28:33.50 --> 00:28:39.86 Now, they have a couple of these sort of, the go sideways.
00:28:39.86 --> 00:28:47.70 A couple of Marines are wounded badly once paralyzed on the last of these raids, a force
00:28:47.70 --> 00:28:53.06 of frog men have to paddle back into shore to rescue their Marine comrades.
00:28:53.06 --> 00:28:59.78 I think, as a unit of them are hanging out in the water and water up to their next because
00:28:59.78 --> 00:29:00.78 they can't swim.
00:29:00.78 --> 00:29:06.62 The UDT's have to, they hand them straps on the boats and they just pull them out
00:29:06.62 --> 00:29:08.82 back out to sea.
00:29:08.82 --> 00:29:10.82 But that doesn't stop there.
00:29:10.82 --> 00:29:15.02 This sort of system, the sag is broken apart, not long after.
00:29:15.02 --> 00:29:19.42 I think they have a three week operational lifespan.
00:29:19.42 --> 00:29:25.62 Maybe this, the sag, the special operations group there in Korea has a three week operational
00:29:25.62 --> 00:29:26.62 career.
00:29:26.62 --> 00:29:35.90 Yeah, it takes it from all the way up to September, right when the in-chon invasion happens.
00:29:35.90 --> 00:29:41.42 Once, after in-chon, that the imperative to cut the supply lines doesn't exist anymore
00:29:41.42 --> 00:29:43.82 because we've cut the enemy in half.
00:29:43.82 --> 00:29:51.50 So once we take in-chon, the North Korean siege of the Pooce on perimeter falls apart.
00:29:51.50 --> 00:29:57.14 So that's not to say that UDT's are no longer involved in raids for the rest of the war.
00:29:57.14 --> 00:30:03.58 What I found the point of the whole chapter was less about the UDT's and more about
00:30:03.58 --> 00:30:14.000 the Navy's preoccupation with partnering with any force that would be able to provide
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000 them raiders.
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.22 So they partner with the, they create sag.
00:30:19.22 --> 00:30:21.58 They partner with Korean partisans.
00:30:21.58 --> 00:30:30.54 They convince the army to release the Royal Marine Commandos for one commando.
00:30:30.54 --> 00:30:35.50 They essentially steal the Royal Marines away from the army they're supposed to go
00:30:35.50 --> 00:30:37.94 serve with the army.
00:30:37.94 --> 00:30:40.70 Admiral Burke was the Chief of Staff under Turner Joy.
00:30:40.70 --> 00:30:46.06 He convinces the army to let him go and creates a one undersea raiding force attached
00:30:46.06 --> 00:30:48.06 to the USS Purge.
00:30:48.06 --> 00:30:52.90 But he also just creates a raiding force to partner with his UDT.
00:30:52.90 --> 00:31:01.74 So every point, all these entities are, they partner with the U.S. Navy to create coastal
00:31:01.74 --> 00:31:02.74 raiders.
00:31:02.74 --> 00:31:06.96 At different points, all these units get plucked away, plucked away, pulled away for various
00:31:06.96 --> 00:31:12.34 reasons, but the Navy is sort of in a telegraping.
00:31:12.34 --> 00:31:16.62 It's interest, it's intent, it's desire for its own raiding force.
00:31:16.62 --> 00:31:20.86 As soon as these groups are pulled away, they partner with another one, partner with
00:31:20.86 --> 00:31:21.86 this one.
00:31:21.86 --> 00:31:29.90 At every point, and always sort of the common denominator in that process are the UDTs.
00:31:29.90 --> 00:31:34.38 UDTs never really become like the, they don't become seals.
00:31:34.38 --> 00:31:41.94 In fact, there are guys like Doug Fain who writes the book, Naked Warrior.
00:31:41.94 --> 00:31:46.18 His position is that the UDTs futures under the water.
00:31:46.18 --> 00:31:53.34 We're going, I mean, he has no interest in inland combat and the contemporaneous documents
00:31:53.34 --> 00:31:54.34 that I found.
00:31:54.34 --> 00:32:00.04 I mean, several of them are saying that the several naval officers are writing that
00:32:00.04 --> 00:32:05.10 UDTs, the UDT, a chain of command really does not like doing this.
00:32:05.10 --> 00:32:10.10 We, I mean, the UDTs would much rather stick to the water.
00:32:10.10 --> 00:32:15.62 They've only done this as an exigency, and we shouldn't rely on the UDTs as an inland
00:32:15.62 --> 00:32:16.62 raiding force.
00:32:16.62 --> 00:32:18.30 We need to create something different.
00:32:18.30 --> 00:32:22.98 So all the way back in 1953, you can see some reluctance by the UDT, whereas the Navy
00:32:22.98 --> 00:32:27.90 sort of pushing the UDT into this, because the UDT, or the Navy, realizes there's real
00:32:27.90 --> 00:32:32.78 strategic potential here and having a force that can do that can project this raiding
00:32:32.78 --> 00:32:36.38 power from the sea.
00:32:36.38 --> 00:32:43.26 One of the other forces that we see surfacing to fill this gap again is talked about in
00:32:43.26 --> 00:32:44.94 chapter eight.
00:32:44.94 --> 00:32:49.78 This is the resurrection of the Army's Rangers and the guerilla raid that failed to force
00:32:49.78 --> 00:32:52.38 all their second death.
00:32:52.38 --> 00:32:57.98 I'm going to go to the book here.
00:32:57.98 --> 00:33:02.70 On November 21, Puckett or Pukett?
00:33:02.70 --> 00:33:03.70 Pukett?
00:33:03.70 --> 00:33:04.70 Pukett.
00:33:04.70 --> 00:33:10.62 On November 21, Pukett's Rangers were loaned to Task Force Dolvin, two battalions of mostly
00:33:10.62 --> 00:33:16.06 tanks and reconnaissance troops intended to range ahead of the rest of the division.
00:33:16.06 --> 00:33:20.98 For a unit whose motto in the last war was Rangers lead the way.
00:33:20.98 --> 00:33:26.70 The promotion from rear guard to skirmishers was an improvement, but still not what it
00:33:26.70 --> 00:33:29.34 had been intended.
00:33:29.34 --> 00:33:31.78 On November 24, the 2 p.m.
00:33:31.78 --> 00:33:35.14 Machine gun fire force the Rangers off their tanks and into the scrub.
00:33:35.14 --> 00:33:42.34 On the valley for Puckett, led the daytime attack to season hold Hill 224 during which one
00:33:42.34 --> 00:33:43.98 Ranger was mortally wounded.
00:33:43.98 --> 00:33:51.46 In the chaos, TF Dolvin's tanks fired on Puckett's men, killing two and wounding six.
00:33:51.46 --> 00:33:56.74 The next day during TF Dolvin's phase movement north, enemy fire again opened up on the
00:33:56.74 --> 00:34:00.82 column this time from behind, realizing they were suddenly surrounded.
00:34:00.82 --> 00:34:05.90 The Rangers bundled off the tanks into the middle of a frozen rice paddy and sprinted
00:34:05.90 --> 00:34:07.94 up Hill 205.
00:34:07.94 --> 00:34:12.82 Enemy fire wounded three more Rangers and convinced one of Puckett's two platoon commanders
00:34:12.82 --> 00:34:18.18 to desert the company and hide behind and hide in the valley command post.
00:34:18.18 --> 00:34:24.50 As darkness fell, the Rangers clawed out frozen fox Hill holes amid the hills emaciated
00:34:24.50 --> 00:34:28.98 pine trees and Puckett scratched down in artillery support plan.
00:34:28.98 --> 00:34:33.98 His roster numbered 58 souls.
00:34:33.98 --> 00:34:40.38 At around 10 p.m. the sound of drums, whistles and pupils rattled the night silence.
00:34:40.38 --> 00:34:46.50 A moment later a cascade of sparks crackled forth from the slope below, followed by the
00:34:46.50 --> 00:34:53.38 hard thud of mortars and grenades, then a wave of attackers in tan, winter padded uniforms.
00:34:53.38 --> 00:34:58.98 The fight that followed was not one the Rangers had been promised.
00:34:58.98 --> 00:35:04.42 Under the ghostly loom of waning red flares, the men fought from the lips of foxholes
00:35:04.42 --> 00:35:11.38 like trench soldiers, relying on artillery to splash their slope clean.
00:35:11.38 --> 00:35:18.42 As with rising tides, every wave inched closer and eroded a bit more, bullets, grenades,
00:35:18.42 --> 00:35:21.46 courage, men.
00:35:21.46 --> 00:35:28.42 After five hours and five waves, no Ranger had more than a few rounds left.
00:35:28.42 --> 00:35:33.94 Any man who had not already done so, fixed his bayonet.
00:35:33.94 --> 00:35:36.22 Then came the sixth wave.
00:35:36.22 --> 00:35:40.82 Shot through the chest with strapped on a shoulder, Puckett ducked into the bottom of
00:35:40.82 --> 00:35:46.02 his foxhole, wrapped white knuckles around his radio handset, cupped the receiver close
00:35:46.02 --> 00:35:50.58 to his mouth, and begged for another salvo of artillery.
00:35:50.58 --> 00:35:54.90 The response get in line.
00:35:54.90 --> 00:35:57.54 I have second after Puckett's last transmission.
00:35:57.54 --> 00:36:03.06 Two mortar shells exploded next to him, killing his remaining west point classmate and
00:36:03.06 --> 00:36:06.90 peppering holes from his feet to his shoulders.
00:36:06.90 --> 00:36:10.74 When he woke up, he laughed.
00:36:10.74 --> 00:36:13.74 There was nothing else to do.
00:36:13.74 --> 00:36:19.90 All around Puckett's men either snake down the hill or fought to the death.
00:36:19.90 --> 00:36:25.22 Holy Mary of Goddamn this rifle, one Catholic Ranger was heard to curse as he wrenched
00:36:25.22 --> 00:36:27.82 to open his frozen bolt.
00:36:27.82 --> 00:36:33.66 The last report of Wilbur Clinton, one of the U.S. Army Army's first black Rangers, was
00:36:33.66 --> 00:36:39.42 the unmistakable sound of him roaring in rage as he charged a cluster of enemy troops
00:36:39.42 --> 00:36:42.90 with an empty rifle.
00:36:42.90 --> 00:36:45.74 He was never seen again.
00:36:45.74 --> 00:36:50.50 Three private first class nearly made it to the valley floor when they were stopped, not
00:36:50.50 --> 00:36:57.86 by the enemy, but by the wind that fills their sails of bravery, their duty.
00:36:57.86 --> 00:37:04.22 Past looters and battlefield executioners, the three stalwarts crept over scrub and
00:37:04.22 --> 00:37:11.26 bodies until they found Puckett alive, but reeling on his hands and knees.
00:37:11.26 --> 00:37:15.54 As they dragged him away, he was heard, muttering the same thing over and over.
00:37:15.54 --> 00:37:16.54 I'm a Ranger.
00:37:16.54 --> 00:37:19.18 I'm a Ranger.
00:37:19.18 --> 00:37:23.78 Months later, McGee would pen a letter to Puckett in the hospital, commending him in the
00:37:23.78 --> 00:37:33.26 8th Army Rangers for carrying forth the fullest interpretation of duty, honor and country.
00:37:33.26 --> 00:37:38.26 This personal satisfaction of doing the job concluded McGee is the highest and often
00:37:38.26 --> 00:37:42.18 the only reward of a soldier.
00:37:42.18 --> 00:37:50.02 In the entire letter, McGee betrayed not a trace of bitterness at the Rangers' misuse.
00:37:50.02 --> 00:37:57.34 Of Puckett's 57 men who started the battle on Hill 205, 17 were wounded and 11 killed,
00:37:57.34 --> 00:38:02.90 their bodies destined for the same fate as those at Sisterna.
00:38:02.90 --> 00:38:09.22 The enemy was estimated to have numbered around 600 and they were not North Koreans with
00:38:09.22 --> 00:38:20.26 some 300,000 troops, China had entered the war.
00:38:20.26 --> 00:38:25.54 Ralph Puckett was just a well-known just, but a year ago, two years ago, there was a war
00:38:25.54 --> 00:38:35.66 in the middle of honor.
00:38:35.66 --> 00:38:39.78 I've always wondered what happened to the three that rescued him.
00:38:39.78 --> 00:38:43.62 If they were appropriately honored.
00:38:43.62 --> 00:38:48.10 That's no small thing to creep back up that hill with the Chinese soldiers.
00:38:48.10 --> 00:38:53.42 That's crazy.
00:38:53.42 --> 00:38:57.10 Is this the raid that failed to first all their second death?
00:38:57.10 --> 00:38:58.38 No, that's not.
00:38:58.38 --> 00:39:05.98 That's an example of the army's misuse of the Rangers.
00:39:05.98 --> 00:39:10.34 The 8th Army Rangers are created in country.
00:39:10.34 --> 00:39:15.82 They're created by John McGee, who is the central character of this book.
00:39:15.82 --> 00:39:18.54 He was a prisoner of war.
00:39:18.54 --> 00:39:23.54 He fought at Paton.
00:39:23.54 --> 00:39:26.54 He was a prisoner of war for most of World War II.
00:39:26.54 --> 00:39:30.50 He tries to create a partisan force, fails to do that in World War II, but this is his
00:39:30.50 --> 00:39:32.90 second chance.
00:39:32.90 --> 00:39:40.34 He is ordered to explore the idea of creating a partisan force at the beginning of the
00:39:40.34 --> 00:39:41.34 Korean War.
00:39:41.34 --> 00:39:48.26 He doesn't find an opportunity for that, but he does a stab-lush an idea for the Rangers.
00:39:48.26 --> 00:39:54.90 The same time he's doing this, the army back in the United States is also getting the idea
00:39:54.90 --> 00:39:58.30 to reconstitute the Rangers.
00:39:58.30 --> 00:40:00.50 So there's sort of two parallel things that are happening.
00:40:00.50 --> 00:40:07.18 One, there's the 8th Army Rangers that back in the United States, they're back at
00:40:07.18 --> 00:40:08.18 fort-bending.
00:40:08.18 --> 00:40:11.50 They're recreating the Ranger company model.
00:40:11.50 --> 00:40:16.62 But nobody really up top is thinking about how to employ these Rangers and one, how to
00:40:16.62 --> 00:40:21.42 create a command to make sure that the Rangers do Ranger missions.
00:40:21.42 --> 00:40:27.86 So once these Rangers are created, unfortunately, all of these Rangers companies get attached
00:40:27.86 --> 00:40:28.86 to divisions.
00:40:28.86 --> 00:40:31.58 Once the divisions have them, they don't really know what to do with them.
00:40:31.58 --> 00:40:33.54 So they just treat them like regular infantry.
00:40:33.54 --> 00:40:36.78 So they've been trained for these behind-the-lines raids.
00:40:36.78 --> 00:40:39.50 Only a couple of behind-lines raids happen.
00:40:39.50 --> 00:40:45.82 So the only thing that could have really first all that second death would have been
00:40:45.82 --> 00:40:50.94 a raid that showed the potential of these Rangers.
00:40:50.94 --> 00:40:55.58 And the raid that could have done that almost succeeds is the Virginia One raid, which
00:40:55.58 --> 00:41:03.10 is sort of a combination of McGee's partisan entities and his Ranger entities.
00:41:03.10 --> 00:41:12.38 He creates this Ranger-led partisan mission to sneak 25 miles behind enemy lines to a inland
00:41:12.38 --> 00:41:17.02 mountain tunnel to destroy that tunnel to cut the enemy supply lines.
00:41:17.02 --> 00:41:21.26 And as you'll find in the book, it's a complete disaster.
00:41:21.26 --> 00:41:23.62 And how's the research on that?
00:41:23.62 --> 00:41:25.62 Did you run into some issues with the research?
00:41:25.62 --> 00:41:29.14 Yeah, it was a tough one to research.
00:41:29.14 --> 00:41:35.26 I knew that this was the raid that I wanted to cover in part because it did so many
00:41:35.26 --> 00:41:36.26 things.
00:41:36.26 --> 00:41:37.26 It did so much work for me.
00:41:37.26 --> 00:41:44.62 I found these sort of two wings of the armies, one their reconstitution of the Rangers,
00:41:44.62 --> 00:41:51.34 but also the armies interest in partisan or guerilla operations into a single mission.
00:41:51.34 --> 00:41:54.14 But I couldn't find a ton on this.
00:41:54.14 --> 00:42:00.06 I had communicated with a guy who'd formally served with McGee in the partisan command
00:42:00.06 --> 00:42:05.34 who'd written a book on this mission.
00:42:05.34 --> 00:42:11.66 I had Evan Howe, I talked to his son, got notes that his dad had used to write his book.
00:42:11.66 --> 00:42:19.06 I wasn't until I was doing my research for research.
00:42:19.06 --> 00:42:22.86 I came across a POW report for McGee.
00:42:22.86 --> 00:42:27.98 So McGee had been a POW in World War II and I knew that one of the members of the Virginia
00:42:27.98 --> 00:42:30.78 One raid had also been a POW.
00:42:30.78 --> 00:42:37.62 So knowing these POW reports existed in the archives, I did a FOIA request to see if there
00:42:37.62 --> 00:42:43.10 was a POW report of similar length for Martin Watson.
00:42:43.10 --> 00:42:47.78 Now, the POW report that I had for McGee was like two pages long.
00:42:47.78 --> 00:42:53.66 I anticipated that I had a two page report for Martin Watson as well.
00:42:53.66 --> 00:42:59.26 After waiting a couple of months, I finally got an email back saying, yes, we have the report.
00:42:59.26 --> 00:43:03.18 I was like, great, can you email me the copy of the report?
00:43:03.18 --> 00:43:04.78 It's like, no, it's in another report.
00:43:04.78 --> 00:43:07.46 It's about 750 pages long.
00:43:07.46 --> 00:43:10.02 What can you just pull Martin Watson's section out?
00:43:10.02 --> 00:43:12.82 Well, they said no, it's 750 pages.
00:43:12.82 --> 00:43:15.98 Okay, right, clearly there's a miscommunication here.
00:43:15.98 --> 00:43:19.22 I'll get at the next time I'm in Maryland.
00:43:19.22 --> 00:43:22.66 Next time I was in Maryland, I spent a whole day researching something else.
00:43:22.66 --> 00:43:24.54 I had moved on from the Virginia One raid.
00:43:24.54 --> 00:43:26.58 I was like, I'm never going to find anything on this.
00:43:26.58 --> 00:43:32.42 I'm going to have to recalibrate, come up with something else that shows what I'm trying to show.
00:43:32.42 --> 00:43:36.58 And to the day, I was like, oh yeah, there's that Martin Watson POW report.
00:43:36.58 --> 00:43:37.58 So I requested it.
00:43:37.58 --> 00:43:39.94 They, you know, wheeled out in the box.
00:43:39.94 --> 00:43:41.86 I had opened the box.
00:43:41.86 --> 00:43:42.86 I pulled it open.
00:43:42.86 --> 00:43:44.42 There's this huge binder.
00:43:44.42 --> 00:43:50.14 And I'm expecting to leave through it and find the Martin Watson section of this POW report.
00:43:50.14 --> 00:43:54.86 One in fact, every single page in this 750 page collection of papers is all about Martin
00:43:54.86 --> 00:43:57.62 Watson and the Virginia One raid.
00:43:57.62 --> 00:43:59.50 It was, they wrote the chapter for me.
00:43:59.50 --> 00:44:01.78 It was, everything was there.
00:44:01.78 --> 00:44:10.22 So let me go to the book on Martin Watson because this guys, well, these Martin Watson raised
00:44:10.22 --> 00:44:16.18 in Hartford, Connecticut's Frog Hollow District by the competing last stripes of an Irish
00:44:16.18 --> 00:44:22.94 Catholic diocese, a German grandmother, and local French bullies, Martin R. Watson,
00:44:22.94 --> 00:44:29.18 a hered fair skinned and small, had survived by learning the languages of each group.
00:44:29.18 --> 00:44:34.30 By building his body until his back was the size of a dinner table and his legs could not
00:44:34.30 --> 00:44:39.82 fit into store-bought swim trunks and by joining up with a gang of local Irish toughs
00:44:39.82 --> 00:44:45.82 who were destined for the usual options of East Coast Irish Destiny, law enforcement
00:44:45.82 --> 00:44:48.30 or crime.
00:44:48.30 --> 00:44:52.14 With 75 arrests by the time he was 19.
00:44:52.14 --> 00:44:58.42 The last one requiring seven police officers to detain him, Watson's future would have undoubtedly
00:44:58.42 --> 00:45:04.06 been the latter if the Japanese had only stayed on their island.
00:45:04.06 --> 00:45:09.38 A member of Darby's first range of Italian since North Africa and thus a veteran of blazing
00:45:09.38 --> 00:45:15.70 heat, bitter cold, three amphibious landings and more than a few mountain top alimos,
00:45:15.70 --> 00:45:22.10 Watson and his echo company Patoon had been among the few groups to reach Cisterna's Outers
00:45:22.10 --> 00:45:23.86 Outskirts.
00:45:23.86 --> 00:45:30.94 There with all hope lost, Watson at just 21 had volunteered to stay behind to cover
00:45:30.94 --> 00:45:32.54 his squad's retreat.
00:45:32.54 --> 00:45:39.18 A sacrifice that resulted in humiliation in the streets of Rome followed by 15 months
00:45:39.18 --> 00:45:45.50 at Stalog 2b situated on the northeastern fringe of the Reich and known
00:45:45.50 --> 00:45:50.38 all above a known above all for its cruelities.
00:45:50.38 --> 00:45:57.22 Watson had responded to captivity by murdering the camp Comodance German Shepherd and by
00:45:57.22 --> 00:46:05.58 attempting so many escapes that the guards had nicknamed him the Hase German for Rabbit.
00:46:05.58 --> 00:46:10.50 Upon liberation Watson had vowed that he would never be a prisoner again.
00:46:10.50 --> 00:46:15.62 Who is a promise, his personality was only to keep for just five months, whereupon, he was
00:46:15.62 --> 00:46:23.10 jailed for 30 days in east Hartford for inciting a riot and resisting arrest, crimes that
00:46:23.10 --> 00:46:30.54 preceded six more similar episodes, breach of peace, assault and toxicated assault and
00:46:30.54 --> 00:46:33.06 assault and battery of a police officer.
00:46:33.06 --> 00:46:38.38 Sorry, I forgot this guy is a freaking maniac.
00:46:38.38 --> 00:46:43.62 For the last charge, Watson would have faced as much as nine months in jail, had he not
00:46:43.62 --> 00:46:48.82 re-installed in the army, then volent revone tiered for the Rangers.
00:46:48.82 --> 00:46:53.66 At that interview for the Virginia One mission, McGee had seen in Watson a man physically
00:46:53.66 --> 00:46:55.38 distinct from the others.
00:46:55.38 --> 00:47:03.82 At six feet four, 240 pounds, a chin haped like a fist, hands the size of country ham's,
00:47:03.82 --> 00:47:08.62 a reddish brown Cadillac mustache with ends as sharp as Tomahawk's.
00:47:08.62 --> 00:47:15.22 The real difference in Watson, however, had lane just below his eyebrows, a gaze so comfortable
00:47:15.22 --> 00:47:21.06 and confident that he looked 15 years older than his 27 years suggested.
00:47:21.06 --> 00:47:22.98 There was only one issue.
00:47:22.98 --> 00:47:30.22 Imposing experienced eager, a predator natural fighter, Watson had ended World War II with
00:47:30.22 --> 00:47:35.82 a rank of T5 technician fifth grade, essentially a corporal.
00:47:35.82 --> 00:47:42.74 In the five years since, he had advanced not a single rank, a fact that belied his leadership
00:47:42.74 --> 00:47:48.02 potential, which was ample, but spoke volumes about his exposure to a military leader's
00:47:48.02 --> 00:47:55.66 responsibilities from mission planning to command and control.
00:47:55.66 --> 00:48:02.98 As you mentioned, he ended up getting captured again.
00:48:02.98 --> 00:48:05.90 He gets captured again.
00:48:05.90 --> 00:48:11.74 Not before he manages to get all three of his Ranger Comrades safely evacuated.
00:48:11.74 --> 00:48:19.66 He winds up escaping from the mountain top, you know, Alamo, that they fight their way off
00:48:19.66 --> 00:48:26.06 of a Navy pilot had crashed, so it's him, a Navy pilot and six Korean partisans, and they
00:48:26.06 --> 00:48:31.78 are making their way something like 87 miles to the coast.
00:48:31.78 --> 00:48:35.30 Not to the coast to friendly lines.
00:48:35.30 --> 00:48:41.86 The Navy pilot gets captured, most of the Koreans get captured only.
00:48:41.86 --> 00:48:47.10 Watson gets captured, I think, two miles from friendly lines, almost makes it.
00:48:47.10 --> 00:48:54.30 In the two Koreans, the do make it back to friendly lines, they ultimately are discovered
00:48:54.30 --> 00:48:59.70 that they had only made it back because they agreed to spy for the North Koreans and
00:48:59.70 --> 00:49:00.70 they are executed.
00:49:00.70 --> 00:49:08.06 I'm going to fast forward a little bit.
00:49:08.06 --> 00:49:13.90 On July 27, 1953, the armistice that effectively ended the Korean war was signed and within
00:49:13.90 --> 00:49:19.34 days the Chinese and North Koreans began publishing daily lists of UN prisoners of war
00:49:19.34 --> 00:49:22.14 earmarked for release.
00:49:22.14 --> 00:49:26.66 For a printing press operator at the New York Times who received each list directly from
00:49:26.66 --> 00:49:33.90 the front, this initiated a high, a nightly series of breath-holding paper-clutching searches
00:49:33.90 --> 00:49:40.26 through line after line of names, not one of them belonging to his son of whom he had
00:49:40.26 --> 00:49:48.62 no had had no information for two years, five months and twenty-six days.
00:49:48.62 --> 00:49:52.14 So this is Watson's old man.
00:49:52.14 --> 00:49:57.50 After 32 nights of this routine and having recently been informed that only one more list
00:49:57.50 --> 00:50:03.62 of 110 names remained to be published, this father left his coworkers and his post behind
00:50:03.62 --> 00:50:06.82 and made for the Connecticut Shore to be alone.
00:50:06.82 --> 00:50:13.46 There, hours later, he was found by local police and informed that the North Koreans had
00:50:13.46 --> 00:50:20.42 at the last minute added a hundred and eleventh name to their final list, a name the
00:50:20.42 --> 00:50:24.82 local police knew all too well.
00:50:24.82 --> 00:50:30.22 In the twenty nine months since his capture, Corporal Martin R. Watson, a soldier no guard or prisoner
00:50:30.22 --> 00:50:35.42 believed was actually a corporal, had set an example for captivity that to this day has
00:50:35.42 --> 00:50:37.66 never been exceeded.
00:50:37.66 --> 00:50:42.98 Thirty days after he was captured for eighteen of which he had been starved in a cave to
00:50:42.98 --> 00:50:49.22 make his 240-pound size, somewhat easier to handle, Watson and a South Korean comrade had
00:50:49.22 --> 00:50:54.18 knocked out a guard with a rock and made for the surrounding mountains where they survived
00:50:54.18 --> 00:50:58.54 for five days until their pursuers had disabled them by rolling or grenade into their
00:50:58.54 --> 00:51:00.26 hideout.
00:51:00.26 --> 00:51:05.02 Never medically treated, except with some shreds of brown paper to cover his wounds, Watson
00:51:05.02 --> 00:51:07.10 had never the less escaped again.
00:51:07.10 --> 00:51:11.42 This time by wriggling out of his rope restraints and jumping free of removing truck
00:51:11.42 --> 00:51:13.50 as it slowed around a bend.
00:51:13.50 --> 00:51:18.10 This time he survived a week before inadvertently walking right past a wide-eyed North
00:51:18.10 --> 00:51:20.42 Korean patrol.
00:51:20.42 --> 00:51:26.10 For these attempts and one other, plus an attempted suicide with a broken piece of glass,
00:51:26.10 --> 00:51:31.02 he had been relentlessly beaten with rifle butts and boot heels and periodically starved
00:51:31.02 --> 00:51:37.90 and almost always isolated, once in an unsheltered hole for seventy-two days with rations
00:51:37.90 --> 00:51:42.46 described by the record as sparse.
00:51:42.46 --> 00:51:48.70 Rightly suspected as an OSS spy and saboteur, Watson had also been subjected to almost daily
00:51:48.70 --> 00:51:54.06 interrogation by the North Koreans, the Chinese, even the Russians, who had drilled him on
00:51:54.06 --> 00:51:59.58 his exposure to the Gestapo in World War II, but especially on the organizations, methods
00:51:59.58 --> 00:52:06.18 and tactics of the paratroop unit to which they knew he belonged.
00:52:06.18 --> 00:52:12.02 Watson's response to these and other questions had been a mixture of stony silence or intentional
00:52:12.02 --> 00:52:17.58 contradiction, responses that had invariably earned him a switch across the eyes, a pistol
00:52:17.58 --> 00:52:22.26 barrel across the face, or hours of kneeling with his nose pressed against a wall and
00:52:22.26 --> 00:52:25.42 a stone on his head.
00:52:25.42 --> 00:52:31.74 Throughout these deprivations, Watson never lost his bearing nor conviction, once standing
00:52:31.74 --> 00:52:37.98 during a packed camp-lucked lecture by a British speaker from the London Daily Worker
00:52:37.98 --> 00:52:43.98 to say that he, quote, didn't know what communism was and didn't care to find out.
00:52:43.98 --> 00:52:51.14 And quote, nor did he and his fellow POWs want to listen to this trainer, Tommy Son of
00:52:51.14 --> 00:52:54.22 a bitch.
00:52:54.22 --> 00:52:59.18 Or this a front, and as his example to other prisoners, he was eventually frog marched
00:52:59.18 --> 00:53:04.66 before a military tribunal, informed of the armistice, then sentenced to death by firing
00:53:04.66 --> 00:53:05.50 squad.
00:53:05.50 --> 00:53:09.22 He still didn't talk.
00:53:09.22 --> 00:53:16.94 In the end, after having been starved from 240 pounds to 120 pounds, his was an example that
00:53:16.94 --> 00:53:23.54 earned him the final distinction as the second to last UN POW to be released across the
00:53:23.54 --> 00:53:27.26 Freedom Bridge.
00:53:27.26 --> 00:53:32.22 On the other side, he learned that the Rangers, he had so steadfastly protected from
00:53:32.22 --> 00:53:36.50 exposure no longer existed.
00:53:36.50 --> 00:53:43.74 I have a hard time listening to that part of it as Dad still.
00:53:43.74 --> 00:53:51.78 I found that newspaper article, and I don't think any Dad can read that without getting
00:53:51.78 --> 00:53:54.78 choked up.
00:53:54.78 --> 00:53:55.78 But not just that.
00:53:55.78 --> 00:54:00.66 I mean, every, I mean, the all 750 pages of that document, I was all there and you just
00:54:00.66 --> 00:54:05.54 do your best to compress, compress, get as much in there as possible, because nobody else
00:54:05.54 --> 00:54:07.30 is writing about this guy.
00:54:07.30 --> 00:54:14.34 You know that you, I mean, at least I suspected, you know, this guy's lost a history.
00:54:14.34 --> 00:54:18.22 Well, last time we, you were on, and we talked about this.
00:54:18.22 --> 00:54:21.22 Actually, the first time you were on, and we talked about this, I said, that's the next
00:54:21.22 --> 00:54:22.22 book, right?
00:54:22.22 --> 00:54:25.98 I take those 750 pages, get it down.
00:54:25.98 --> 00:54:28.22 Let's chop it down to, you know, 500.
00:54:28.22 --> 00:54:29.22 Yes.
00:54:29.22 --> 00:54:30.22 Yeah.
00:54:30.22 --> 00:54:32.62 There, there would be problems to do that, but I think you're right.
00:54:32.62 --> 00:54:33.62 What would be the problems?
00:54:33.62 --> 00:54:35.82 Because I'll just go and photocopy that thing.
00:54:35.82 --> 00:54:37.22 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
00:54:37.22 --> 00:54:40.06 That's the, the way that the documents are aligned out.
00:54:40.06 --> 00:54:44.74 It's a, each one of these things are each of that 750 pages.
00:54:44.74 --> 00:54:49.02 All of these are, most of the things in there are interviews with inmates, other
00:54:49.02 --> 00:54:51.86 inmates, and there's no, like, chronology to them.
00:54:51.86 --> 00:54:58.38 So what I've done, which is, I mean, it's kind of a wrap-up or, like, a montage of things,
00:54:58.38 --> 00:55:08.58 that's the best I could do considering the timeline that I had available to me.
00:55:08.58 --> 00:55:09.90 But what else is not in there?
00:55:09.90 --> 00:55:15.70 I mean, the, I mean, the entire epitaph for Martin Watson is, you know, what comes
00:55:15.70 --> 00:55:16.94 after the war?
00:55:16.94 --> 00:55:20.38 And that's, you know, what comes after the war for so many of these guys.
00:55:20.38 --> 00:55:27.56 You know, I've talked to, you know, a number of his, you know, family members, and it's
00:55:27.56 --> 00:55:28.56 tragedy.
00:55:28.56 --> 00:55:36.18 I mean, though he survives the war, and, you know, he comes back and, I mean, he's honored,
00:55:36.18 --> 00:55:39.26 you know, he's not sufficiently, I don't think.
00:55:39.26 --> 00:55:44.58 I mean, if there's anybody in the book that, you know, is deserving military member
00:55:44.58 --> 00:55:46.98 of the Medal of Honor, it's, it's Watson.
00:55:46.98 --> 00:55:50.82 I think he was, he received, right, I know he received a silver star for that, which I think
00:55:50.82 --> 00:55:53.62 is completely insufficient.
00:55:53.62 --> 00:55:57.30 But what happens after the fact is, you know, he comes back to a wife, comes back and he
00:55:57.30 --> 00:56:03.18 has children, and he's not capable of managing that.
00:56:03.18 --> 00:56:10.94 Ultimately, he is because of his demons, he leaves his family, escapes to Alaska, you know,
00:56:10.94 --> 00:56:14.46 works on an oil pipeline for years.
00:56:14.46 --> 00:56:23.02 Only sees his son, I think, like, two dozen times, and, you know, after he leaves, gets
00:56:23.02 --> 00:56:28.82 cancer, and dies, I think, when his son is about 12 years old.
00:56:28.82 --> 00:56:34.34 One of the last memories that his son has of him is in the hospital bed, and he's
00:56:34.34 --> 00:56:41.34 drunk from, you know, the monster of him, and that he used to be into this emaciated figure,
00:56:41.34 --> 00:56:46.98 and every time his son would come to the hospital to see his dad, his dad, the password
00:56:46.98 --> 00:57:02.86 that he had to knock, or he had to give before he came into the hospital room was courage.
00:57:02.86 --> 00:57:09.86 So again, unbelievable detail in here.
00:57:09.86 --> 00:57:16.26 Although you did mention there's a raid that you've cut from the book.
00:57:16.26 --> 00:57:17.86 Yeah, the witch on the camera.
00:57:17.86 --> 00:57:18.86 On the witch on damn.
00:57:18.86 --> 00:57:20.30 What was that all about?
00:57:20.30 --> 00:57:24.94 So the witch on damn raid is, it's another, you know, failed attempt.
00:57:24.94 --> 00:57:33.58 It's probably the one, if the Virginia one raid wasn't the raid that would have convinced
00:57:33.58 --> 00:57:39.26 our replanters that, you know, the Rangers had a purpose to play in this conflict, then
00:57:39.26 --> 00:57:48.26 it was the, the way John damn raid, and that was a happening almost the exact same time
00:57:48.26 --> 00:57:57.98 as the, as the Virginia one team was escaping south along with peninsula, but it was,
00:57:57.98 --> 00:58:05.74 it was a, it was not well planned, but it was a, it was supposed to be a raid on, to see
00:58:05.74 --> 00:58:09.62 his a dam from the North Koreans or from the, from the Chinese that were holding it,
00:58:09.62 --> 00:58:11.98 and they had to row across a lake.
00:58:11.98 --> 00:58:19.66 They had to collect, you know, what, what little boats that the army had, I mean, within
00:58:19.66 --> 00:58:24.90 24 hours, they threw this thing together, and the Rangers had to paddle secretly across,
00:58:24.90 --> 00:58:30.78 land on an enemy shore, and then climb up a mountain to try and get around this dam, and
00:58:30.78 --> 00:58:37.70 in the process of that, they're contacted by sort of a readout, you know, there was positioned
00:58:37.70 --> 00:58:38.70 well away from the dam.
00:58:38.70 --> 00:58:39.98 They didn't even close to the dam.
00:58:39.98 --> 00:58:45.58 So before, you know, the morning is even out, they can't, they can't retreat, they can't
00:58:45.58 --> 00:58:47.98 advance, they can't receive supplies.
00:58:47.98 --> 00:58:54.10 Eventually, they are, another force comes and, and relieves them and rescues them, but
00:58:54.10 --> 00:58:57.42 the raid itself is a disaster.
00:58:57.42 --> 00:59:06.90 It's not until later that the dam is actually pummeled by Navy, Navy fighter bombers,
00:59:06.90 --> 00:59:11.78 that the raid is dismantled or taken.
00:59:11.78 --> 00:59:15.98 But that was the one raid I thought, you know, if I couldn't do the Virginia one raid,
00:59:15.98 --> 00:59:19.82 and I couldn't show how the army, you know, had turned its back again on this radar concept,
00:59:19.82 --> 00:59:22.54 and it would have been the way John Dam raid.
00:59:22.54 --> 00:59:28.86 It's, you know, equally, you know, dramatic and it's equally important.
00:59:28.86 --> 00:59:32.14 It's just one of those things you have to make a choice as, you know, as a historian,
00:59:32.14 --> 00:59:33.14 what are you going to focus on?
00:59:33.14 --> 00:59:37.18 You've got to, you know, keep moving the reader into the next, you know, the, you don't
00:59:37.18 --> 00:59:40.98 want to just jam him up and create, you've got to keep moving forward.
00:59:40.98 --> 00:59:49.18 So, and so ultimately we end up leaving the Korean war with still no real commando unit,
00:59:49.18 --> 00:59:50.18 correct?
00:59:50.18 --> 00:59:58.70 And moving in past the Korean war into chapter nine, Arlie Burke, the Bay of Pigs, and the
00:59:58.70 --> 01:00:03.14 launching of the Navy's limited war seals.
01:00:03.14 --> 01:00:11.18 And I'm going to the book on this proposed as separate and distinct from the fleets,
01:00:11.18 --> 01:00:19.10 UDTs, the recruits for the new, for the two new seal teams, one on each coast would,
01:00:19.10 --> 01:00:26.58 like Adam's rib, be drawn from them, ten officers and 50 enlisted men per team, all
01:00:26.58 --> 01:00:31.62 graduates of the training first conceived for the Scouts and Raiders, then modified by
01:00:31.62 --> 01:00:34.42 Kaufman for the NCDUs.
01:00:34.42 --> 01:00:41.54 The specialized training needed to create the seals, said the memo, would occur at existing
01:00:41.54 --> 01:00:49.94 Army and Navy schools, or could be added to the present UDT curriculum as required.
01:00:49.94 --> 01:00:56.54 The four long rumors of a naval commando unit began to hover so thickly above the UDTs,
01:00:56.54 --> 01:01:01.34 that many took the clouds for smoke of their own making.
01:01:01.34 --> 01:01:06.86 It would require another six months of CNO level conversations, meetings in Memoranda,
01:01:06.86 --> 01:01:11.66 to allocate funding, to carve out basing, to hammer out organizational plans and chains
01:01:11.66 --> 01:01:16.70 of command, to purchase commercial watercraft and fund new research for silent motors,
01:01:16.70 --> 01:01:22.10 to resurrect six mothball, mothballed APDs from retirement, to study the country of
01:01:22.10 --> 01:01:27.82 South Vietnam, and there to embark on a type of riverine warfare, said one memo that the
01:01:27.82 --> 01:01:33.90 Navy had not seriously attacked since the war between the states.
01:01:33.90 --> 01:01:40.30 And at the end of that six months, the Navy would quietly, without any ceremony, commission
01:01:40.30 --> 01:01:47.90 seal team one on Corn, Ottawa, and San Diego, and seal team two at Little Creek in Virginia
01:01:47.90 --> 01:01:48.90 Beach.
01:01:48.90 --> 01:01:55.90 So, this is where starting to get to that culminating point.
01:01:55.90 --> 01:02:04.50 Yeah, I mean, the, I mean, you touch on the controversy there, I mean, there's this whole
01:02:04.50 --> 01:02:13.98 period after the seal teams are created, where guys start coming out of the woodwork,
01:02:13.98 --> 01:02:15.82 I say, this was my idea.
01:02:15.82 --> 01:02:20.90 I did this, I'm going to go on the road to memo, let's see it.
01:02:20.90 --> 01:02:27.90 Let's see the memo, you know, Roy Ballum, who was, he wrote an entire book called The First
01:02:27.90 --> 01:02:28.90 Seal.
01:02:28.90 --> 01:02:33.90 I mean, he makes the case that it was him that put this thing together, and he based,
01:02:33.90 --> 01:02:40.10 you know, his idea in part off of Mary Miles's book, a different kind of war, a different
01:02:40.10 --> 01:02:45.22 kind of war didn't come out for five years after, after one, the seal teams are created.
01:02:45.22 --> 01:02:51.14 Oh, I don't think to use Mary Miles is like, his book is the, anyway.
01:02:51.14 --> 01:02:57.90 But yeah, there's, I mean, there's, oops, yeah, oh, yeah.
01:02:57.90 --> 01:03:03.06 But, you know, it's this whole thing, that's none of this would have happened without,
01:03:03.06 --> 01:03:08.06 like we talked about in the last episode, not without the effort, without the foresight
01:03:08.06 --> 01:03:09.78 of Burke.
01:03:09.78 --> 01:03:17.70 And, you know, there were lots of, you know, folks in the UDT's that they had no interest
01:03:17.70 --> 01:03:19.06 in going in this direction.
01:03:19.06 --> 01:03:20.06 There were some that did.
01:03:20.06 --> 01:03:23.46 I mean, there was a, there was a contingent of folks, and like I talked about fielding
01:03:23.46 --> 01:03:25.10 point in, atchison.
01:03:25.10 --> 01:03:29.34 There were guys that had experienced those, you know, those raids in the Korean war,
01:03:29.34 --> 01:03:32.30 and they knew that there was something that more that they could be doing.
01:03:32.30 --> 01:03:38.10 But I don't think anybody in the UDT's was proposing this, this, this, this force,
01:03:38.10 --> 01:03:39.46 this go anywhere force.
01:03:39.46 --> 01:03:44.30 And, and the, and the, the idea that this would be a go anywhere force.
01:03:44.30 --> 01:03:46.94 It's, it's there in the, in the original name.
01:03:46.94 --> 01:03:50.82 I mean, nobody had really thought that, you know, they were going to be creating this
01:03:50.82 --> 01:03:52.30 capture kill command of force.
01:03:52.30 --> 01:03:55.18 But they had thought of that go anywhere capability.
01:03:55.18 --> 01:03:56.46 And that's there from the beginning.
01:03:56.46 --> 01:03:59.62 That sea, air, and land capability.
01:03:59.62 --> 01:04:00.62 Mm-hmm.
01:04:00.62 --> 01:04:05.50 And that was all derived from the series of committees.
01:04:05.50 --> 01:04:12.58 And, you know, memoranda and meetings that Burke had convened with his senior staffers.
01:04:12.58 --> 01:04:16.74 And they had pulled that from all the ideas that they've been collecting from the fleet.
01:04:16.74 --> 01:04:22.30 They've been interviewing and talking and having people write white papers and just develop
01:04:22.30 --> 01:04:23.30 ideas.
01:04:23.30 --> 01:04:29.10 And, I mean, the one, you know, genius of Burke is that he realizes he's not a genius.
01:04:29.10 --> 01:04:31.66 He's pulling ideas from every place he can possibly get them.
01:04:31.66 --> 01:04:34.38 So one, you know, these guys say that it was my idea.
01:04:34.38 --> 01:04:39.66 You know, I'm not necessarily, you know, so confident that they didn't send these memoranda.
01:04:39.66 --> 01:04:40.66 We just don't have it.
01:04:40.66 --> 01:04:45.78 We don't, I mean, there's only one person who's responsible for that, you know, final establishment.
01:04:45.78 --> 01:04:50.26 That's him, Burke.
01:04:50.26 --> 01:04:55.62 The strange thing about this is, you know, you say, well, there's a lot of UDT guys
01:04:55.62 --> 01:04:59.18 that were sort of like, hey, we don't want to do that.
01:04:59.18 --> 01:05:05.26 And if you were to, if you were to ask probably the entire time that I've been that
01:05:05.26 --> 01:05:12.54 I was in the SEAL teams up until today, the percentage of people that, if you gave
01:05:12.54 --> 01:05:17.18 them the choice of what type of operation they wanted to conduct.
01:05:17.18 --> 01:05:18.18 Yeah, right.
01:05:18.18 --> 01:05:19.58 I know you know where I'm going.
01:05:19.58 --> 01:05:20.58 This is right.
01:05:20.58 --> 01:05:21.58 Puzzle.
01:05:21.58 --> 01:05:26.18 Like everyone would say, hey, we want to be on land.
01:05:26.18 --> 01:05:27.18 We want to push another land.
01:05:27.18 --> 01:05:28.18 We want to push another land.
01:05:28.18 --> 01:05:30.18 Look, it's, is it cool to come over the beach?
01:05:30.18 --> 01:05:31.18 Hell yeah, it is.
01:05:31.18 --> 01:05:32.18 It's awesome.
01:05:32.18 --> 01:05:33.42 But we want to go over the beach.
01:05:33.42 --> 01:05:36.82 We want to get from the water to the land.
01:05:36.82 --> 01:05:40.82 That's where the, the cool things are happening.
01:05:40.82 --> 01:05:47.82 It's interesting to think that it's, it's interesting to think that you would back in
01:05:47.82 --> 01:05:48.82 the day.
01:05:48.82 --> 01:05:52.74 Like, I know, if it wasn't, if it wasn't for the SEAL teams, if I didn't see pictures
01:05:52.74 --> 01:05:59.10 of freaking guys dressed up like commandos with machine guns in Vietnam, I'd never
01:05:59.10 --> 01:06:01.30 would have joined the Navy ever.
01:06:01.30 --> 01:06:02.30 Not a million years.
01:06:02.30 --> 01:06:06.02 A few had only seen a picture of a guy in swim trunks with a dive knife.
01:06:06.02 --> 01:06:08.70 Yeah, I mean, yeah, it was that is, yeah, what is that?
01:06:08.70 --> 01:06:09.70 What are you doing?
01:06:09.70 --> 01:06:10.70 I don't know.
01:06:10.70 --> 01:06:14.10 But the thing is, like everybody who, you know, joined the SEAL teams in that era, that's
01:06:14.10 --> 01:06:15.10 what they were joining for.
01:06:15.10 --> 01:06:16.46 They weren't joining because of the SEAL teams.
01:06:16.46 --> 01:06:17.94 Nobody knew what the SEAL teams were.
01:06:17.94 --> 01:06:21.10 It wasn't until, you know, they got there and they were like, oh, there's this other
01:06:21.10 --> 01:06:22.10 thing?
01:06:22.10 --> 01:06:25.54 Mike Thornton, he Norris, Peter, some Bob Gallagher.
01:06:25.54 --> 01:06:26.74 They didn't join the SEAL teams.
01:06:26.74 --> 01:06:27.74 They joined the UDT.
01:06:27.74 --> 01:06:28.74 They joined the UDT.
01:06:28.74 --> 01:06:29.74 Yeah.
01:06:29.74 --> 01:06:34.18 And, you know, regardless, they created this institution.
01:06:34.18 --> 01:06:41.02 The other thing that's interesting about this is, when you think about the senior leadership
01:06:41.02 --> 01:06:49.82 in the Navy, including Burke, being on a ship off the coast, unless you're in World
01:06:49.82 --> 01:06:56.82 War 2, you're going to attack by Kamikaze, being in a ship off the coast of combat is totally,
01:06:56.82 --> 01:06:58.58 it's a world away.
01:06:58.58 --> 01:07:05.74 If you're in a ship off the coast of a combat zone, you are a world away from combat.
01:07:05.74 --> 01:07:08.86 Like I said, unless you're in World War 2 and there's freaking Kamikaze coming at you,
01:07:08.86 --> 01:07:09.86 God bless you.
01:07:09.86 --> 01:07:13.26 But if you're not in World War 2, or whatever this next war is going to be, or whatever
01:07:13.26 --> 01:07:16.86 this next war is going to be, possibly.
01:07:16.86 --> 01:07:17.86 Yeah.
01:07:17.86 --> 01:07:18.86 Yeah.
01:07:18.86 --> 01:07:20.94 You're in a different scenario.
01:07:20.94 --> 01:07:29.50 So it's interesting to think that the senior leadership thought, let us get involved in
01:07:29.50 --> 01:07:30.50 that.
01:07:30.50 --> 01:07:38.10 Let us the Navy get involved in that stuff over there, over the horizon, onto the land,
01:07:38.10 --> 01:07:41.94 where there's bullets and bad guys and snakes.
01:07:41.94 --> 01:07:45.94 It's, you would think, part of the Navy would say, hey, look, that's not really our business.
01:07:45.94 --> 01:07:46.94 That's not our thing.
01:07:46.94 --> 01:07:47.94 We're staying our lane over here.
01:07:47.94 --> 01:07:49.58 It will get you to the beach.
01:07:49.58 --> 01:07:51.54 You take it from there.
01:07:51.54 --> 01:07:56.78 So if it wasn't for this void that the Navy had seen over and over and over again, where
01:07:56.78 --> 01:08:02.02 they couldn't get someone to do what we needed them to do, the Navy couldn't get
01:08:02.02 --> 01:08:06.46 Kamandos to do what they needed Kamandos to do.
01:08:06.46 --> 01:08:08.02 Anybody could have stepped into this role?
01:08:08.02 --> 01:08:10.02 Anybody could have?
01:08:10.02 --> 01:08:20.02 Yeah.
01:08:20.02 --> 01:08:22.90 When I look back and you can almost use the example of aviation as a counter to my whole thesis.
01:08:22.90 --> 01:08:29.10 You could say, well, just because the army in the Marine Corps failed to do this doesn't
01:08:29.10 --> 01:08:33.78 mean that Navy wouldn't have done this as well.
01:08:33.78 --> 01:08:35.54 You could have had the Rangers.
01:08:35.54 --> 01:08:37.02 You could have had the Green Berets.
01:08:37.02 --> 01:08:38.30 You could have had all of these entities.
01:08:38.30 --> 01:08:40.18 The Navy still would have created this field teams.
01:08:40.18 --> 01:08:41.18 I say, that's wrong.
01:08:41.18 --> 01:08:42.42 I don't think so.
01:08:42.42 --> 01:08:48.82 The reason I think that that's wrong is because of all these episodes of the Navy attempting
01:08:48.82 --> 01:08:51.34 to partner time and time again.
01:08:51.34 --> 01:08:55.86 The Navy is constantly saying, we will support you.
01:08:55.86 --> 01:09:01.82 We will just let us partner with something, stop taking this away from us because all
01:09:01.82 --> 01:09:06.38 through the Korean War, all through World War II, the Navy is sponsoring various Kamandos
01:09:06.38 --> 01:09:07.38 units.
01:09:07.38 --> 01:09:13.62 I don't think that argument, it's not an argument that's been made back to me, but it
01:09:13.62 --> 01:09:18.54 was an argument that I was thinking about when I was writing this book to confirm to
01:09:18.54 --> 01:09:22.58 sort of means test my own thesis.
01:09:22.58 --> 01:09:29.54 None of this would have happened without that neglect, but it would not have happened without
01:09:29.54 --> 01:09:33.26 that mentality, the Burk had.
01:09:33.26 --> 01:09:38.74 There was a combination of two things.
01:09:38.74 --> 01:09:40.38 It was the neglect of the Army in the Marine Corps, but it was also not just neglect.
01:09:40.38 --> 01:09:42.10 It didn't just create that space.
01:09:42.10 --> 01:09:50.98 It was also, you have this person who is this person of Burk who can't stomach a Navy
01:09:50.98 --> 01:09:53.50 that is not connected to combat.
01:09:53.50 --> 01:09:57.90 If those two things hadn't collided, there would not be a seal team.
01:09:57.90 --> 01:10:06.70 Here's a hypothesis, and I don't know how this is going to land, but I'm taking a shot
01:10:06.70 --> 01:10:08.78 at it.
01:10:08.78 --> 01:10:15.18 The water, the water sucks for operations.
01:10:15.18 --> 01:10:18.50 It completely sucks for operations.
01:10:18.50 --> 01:10:25.58 It ruins your weapons, it ruins your radios, it makes you cold, it can kill you.
01:10:25.58 --> 01:10:30.02 And the water absolutely sucks for operations.
01:10:30.02 --> 01:10:36.86 And throughout all of these opportunities for all these other units to say, hey, we got this,
01:10:36.86 --> 01:10:43.10 I think it seems like at least it might have been a little bit of a factor, just a little
01:10:43.10 --> 01:10:47.02 tiny bit of a factor for everybody.
01:10:47.02 --> 01:10:50.06 When the big Navy says, hey, we need somebody that can stay in the water and also go
01:10:50.06 --> 01:10:53.06 up on that, and everyone goes, hey, what's it take to land part of it?
01:10:53.06 --> 01:10:57.50 They go, we'll give it a try, but then damn, that sucked.
01:10:57.50 --> 01:11:00.38 We were freezing, our weapons didn't work.
01:11:00.38 --> 01:11:02.74 We lost two guys that drowned, right?
01:11:02.74 --> 01:11:03.74 That's what happens.
01:11:03.74 --> 01:11:04.74 And there's no enemy there.
01:11:04.74 --> 01:11:05.74 Yeah, absolutely.
01:11:05.74 --> 01:11:08.62 Without any wants to do back there.
01:11:08.62 --> 01:11:13.10 I mean, there's some things that maybe you want us to blow up from time to time, and you
01:11:13.10 --> 01:11:17.98 may want us to figure out how deep the water here is.
01:11:17.98 --> 01:11:26.30 A lot of us just, the whole gap of the animals are the revolt of the animals.
01:11:26.30 --> 01:11:27.78 They want to prove their relevant.
01:11:27.78 --> 01:11:29.86 Everybody wants to be relevant.
01:11:29.86 --> 01:11:33.70 Institutions are just collections of people.
01:11:33.70 --> 01:11:39.30 Institutions are going to make themselves relevant, whether it's in the market or with government
01:11:39.30 --> 01:11:40.30 agencies.
01:11:40.30 --> 01:11:45.34 We're going to find opportunities, there are no opportunities.
01:11:45.34 --> 01:11:48.86 We're going to make them.
01:11:48.86 --> 01:11:52.10 I mean, everybody wants to earn their paycheck and feel like they've done something.
01:11:52.10 --> 01:11:55.86 I mean, if there's nothing to do, well, you're going to find it.
01:11:55.86 --> 01:11:59.62 Yeah, I'm going to find something.
01:11:59.62 --> 01:12:04.02 You talked about Berks CNO ceremony a little bit when we kicked this thing off.
01:12:04.02 --> 01:12:08.26 I mean, were you going to, what else were you going to say about that?
01:12:08.26 --> 01:12:10.06 The whole chapter had started.
01:12:10.06 --> 01:12:15.72 I found, I actually found Berks CNO ceremony on YouTube.
01:12:15.72 --> 01:12:17.92 I don't know how many times I watched it.
01:12:17.92 --> 01:12:19.62 I mean, I don't know how many times.
01:12:19.62 --> 01:12:23.38 When he became CNO, that's on YouTube.
01:12:23.38 --> 01:12:24.38 That's on YouTube.
01:12:24.38 --> 01:12:28.16 I think there's 500 views.
01:12:28.16 --> 01:12:31.58 I'm responsible for 485.
01:12:31.58 --> 01:12:32.58 How long is it?
01:12:32.58 --> 01:12:34.50 I'm like, well, I mean, they compress it.
01:12:34.50 --> 01:12:38.20 It's like I think there's a couple of different versions of it.
01:12:38.20 --> 01:12:45.76 Maybe 30 minutes. Okay, but there's different speakers and everything and I'm watching this thing like time after time
01:12:45.76 --> 01:12:48.72 I remember watching this thing like you know in the middle and night like
01:12:49.08 --> 01:12:55.30 You know, I'm not doing anything bad. I'm watching 50 year old maybe see you know
01:12:56.76 --> 01:12:59.96 Did he give a powerful speech or something now his speech is terrible?
01:13:00.48 --> 01:13:03.04 He's not a good speaker. He's sort of choppy
01:13:03.04 --> 01:13:07.80 Is a couple other speakers that get up in the process that are actually they're that are better than him
01:13:07.80 --> 01:13:10.04 So why are you so hyped on this thing that you watched it for?
01:13:10.04 --> 01:13:13.48 499 times you know, I think a lot of it was just because I mean
01:13:13.48 --> 01:13:15.44 You know some of the things that are said, you know
01:13:15.44 --> 01:13:17.44 They're talking about this you know this revolution
01:13:18.16 --> 01:13:20.16 That's that's undergoing
01:13:20.16 --> 01:13:29.16 With naval warfare that's about to you know undergoes naval warfare and when Burke gets up he articulates sort of you know his ideas and you know
01:13:29.16 --> 01:13:31.16 So many of his ideas are you know
01:13:31.16 --> 01:13:38.56 The the navies at the cusp of this technological revolution and so when Burke comes into office my you know
01:13:38.56 --> 01:13:42.56 Any any person who listen to that speech would think alright well
01:13:42.84 --> 01:13:45.56 The navy is going to evolve
01:13:46.40 --> 01:13:52.84 They're going to go deeper. They're gonna go further up. They're going to you know start taking advantage of nuclear weapons
01:13:52.84 --> 01:13:58.36 It's gonna be a technological revolution in the navy and that's what where it will stop
01:13:58.36 --> 01:14:00.36 But that's not what happens. Burke's
01:14:03.56 --> 01:14:05.56 Burke's interest
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.20 Burke's emphasis does not stop he yes. He modernizes the fleet
01:14:11.36 --> 01:14:14.48 He takes he puts nuclear weapons on submarines
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000 He stretches the navies reach from you know the bottom of the ocean to the edge of the atmosphere
01:14:20.84 --> 01:14:22.84 But in between that gap
01:14:22.84 --> 01:14:29.24 He also does a lot of things. I'm you know, I think the most consequential is the establishment of this unit
01:14:31.24 --> 01:14:35.24 You wouldn't predict that or you would not have seen you know a
01:14:39.04 --> 01:14:44.36 He would not have you know conveyed any plans like that in that that presentation
01:14:44.36 --> 01:14:50.68 So are that initial speech I was so I was watching it not just for what was said for what for what was not said
01:14:50.68 --> 01:14:57.000 How much credit are you given to Kennedy in this old gig so Kennedy? So there's a lot of you know old for argument that you meet
01:14:57.84 --> 01:15:04.48 Who they still think that the seal team is would not exist without Kennedy
01:15:05.36 --> 01:15:12.24 It's a really apparently compelling you know myth I don't know why because you know Kennedy
01:15:12.76 --> 01:15:16.88 dies in November of 63 the seal team is our established in January of 62 and
01:15:16.88 --> 01:15:23.96 If there's anything that we learn you know in the preceding chapters of this book is that you know all of these units
01:15:25.04 --> 01:15:27.82 They could have been you know killed in the crib you know
01:15:27.82 --> 01:15:30.88 They could have you know strangled the death and an infancy or smothered
01:15:31.04 --> 01:15:36.40 You know by a pillow is how I describe it like these all of these units could have been you know
01:15:36.72 --> 01:15:40.68 Dispanted I mean the seal teams are only two years old at the time of Kennedy's death
01:15:40.76 --> 01:15:44.76 So even if Kennedy had been responsible and I don't think he is because
01:15:44.76 --> 01:15:48.36 All of the committees that Burke has convened
01:15:49.36 --> 01:15:54.32 Before Kennedy's even elected, you know, they proceed you know they proceed as is election. They're already mentioning
01:15:54.32 --> 01:15:58.76 You know the word seal before Kennedy's elected they have these plans already in place
01:15:59.88 --> 01:16:04.28 Kennedy's supportive of them, but he's not they he's not the reason that they're
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.64 Put into place yeah some of some of Kennedy's speeches
01:16:09.12 --> 01:16:11.58 You know he's talking about unconventional warfare
01:16:11.58 --> 01:16:15.92 He's talking about all these command O type of things and he wants everybody to get involved in us
01:16:15.92 --> 01:16:17.92 He does but the Navy was and
01:16:18.54 --> 01:16:25.94 The Navy's already forward leaning into this. I mean the the army to the army. I mean and when Kennedy comes in you know his
01:16:27.02 --> 01:16:31.38 You know he has a love affair with the concept of you know counter insurgency and the
01:16:31.86 --> 01:16:35.66 His favorite you know unit of all time which is the army special forces
01:16:36.14 --> 01:16:40.50 But yeah, I think I've read up speech of his at West Point
01:16:40.50 --> 01:16:44.46 That's real actually I've read it on this podcast because it's sort of sort of how
01:16:45.30 --> 01:16:51.98 It indicates so much the whole idea of the special forces special operations and how big it's gonna be for him
01:16:52.62 --> 01:16:57.60 What about going as you're trying to research the Bay of pigs you know you got the CIA was there
01:16:58.26 --> 01:17:03.06 How available is information about that? It's a black hole to this day
01:17:03.06 --> 01:17:07.28 Just I don't know how many requests I made of the the CIA's archives
01:17:07.28 --> 01:17:12.40 For information I would find you know a thing here there, but not not very much
01:17:14.24 --> 01:17:17.24 There I was able to find
01:17:17.92 --> 01:17:23.64 Several of the frogmen that participated in the Bay of pigs. I was writing up until the final days
01:17:25.20 --> 01:17:29.96 Before the the publisher literally you know rip the book out of my hands. I was I was talking to
01:17:31.24 --> 01:17:33.24 Korean frogmen or a
01:17:33.64 --> 01:17:35.64 Cuban frogmen
01:17:35.64 --> 01:17:38.40 And you know found one I couldn't believe I found him
01:17:39.28 --> 01:17:43.28 Interviewed him and then he gave you know me a number for another guy
01:17:43.28 --> 01:17:44.28 I couldn't believe you know
01:17:44.28 --> 01:17:48.60 He did and I talked to him gave me a number for another one before I knew it. I was talking to all these guys
01:17:48.60 --> 01:17:53.88 I was like oh my gosh. This is incredible didn't never expected you know to find any of these
01:17:54.16 --> 01:18:00.44 You know me covert operatives, but you know here they are and they wanted to tell their story. So it was pretty cool
01:18:02.28 --> 01:18:03.28 Awesome
01:18:03.28 --> 01:18:06.96 So we get through that time anything else you want to cover in that chapter
01:18:08.56 --> 01:18:13.76 I mean you could now I think I've raised an lunch and and rip Robertson. I mean these are
01:18:14.88 --> 01:18:20.64 These are guys that you cut I didn't cut them they're in the book. I mean they they they could be their own
01:18:20.64 --> 01:18:25.08 Yeah, they could be their own books. I mean they're both you know they're both the CIA
01:18:25.84 --> 01:18:30.68 You know not case officers. They're the paramilitary officers that are leading
01:18:30.68 --> 01:18:36.68 Not just the reconnaissance not just the Cuban frogmen or the raid the Cuban frogmen do
01:18:37.16 --> 01:18:39.64 But they're also you know running the entire
01:18:43.64 --> 01:18:46.04 The mission they're they're back on ships
01:18:46.28 --> 01:18:53.20 You know reeling information doing everything they can to support the invasion they're held you know back and then when
01:18:53.52 --> 01:18:54.32 the
01:18:54.32 --> 01:19:02.04 Brigade forces collapse both Robertson and Lynch they spend two weeks sleeping almost not at all
01:19:02.60 --> 01:19:06.64 Doing everything they can to rescue as many Brigades survivors as they can
01:19:07.20 --> 01:19:13.64 So when they finally do get pulled or when they finally do get pulled in the Navy supporting that entire effort
01:19:13.92 --> 01:19:18.48 The Navy doesn't support the the initial raid almost at all despite
01:19:18.48 --> 01:19:24.88 Berks repeated protests and has repeated attempts to get Kennedy to to let the Navy intervene
01:19:25.52 --> 01:19:30.88 But the Navy does not abandon the the Cuban brigade members they they
01:19:31.56 --> 01:19:34.20 Night after night the Navy sending whale boats ashore
01:19:35.64 --> 01:19:39.80 Do anything they can to rescue survivors and the most compelling
01:19:40.84 --> 01:19:44.56 Characters and the whole testimony that are a rubber Kennedy
01:19:44.56 --> 01:19:48.76 Convenes in the aftermath of these two guys when they they show back up
01:19:49.48 --> 01:19:54.92 To testify in front of this committee and they're there's completely sunburned black almost
01:19:55.20 --> 01:19:59.64 They show up and boots that are salted or crested white with salt water. I mean
01:20:00.52 --> 01:20:03.02 Pretty pretty convincing
01:20:03.02 --> 01:20:07.12 And and Grace and Lynch, you know, he goes to his grave, you know
01:20:07.52 --> 01:20:11.28 Hating anything you know, we're remotely related to Kennedy
01:20:11.28 --> 01:20:15.56 He goes on to another career. He was an Omaha beach. He was at Omaha beach
01:20:15.56 --> 01:20:17.36 He became a was a green beret
01:20:17.36 --> 01:20:22.46 They joins the CIA. I think he ends his government service with the DA starts the DA
01:20:22.46 --> 01:20:24.46 You're a believe it
01:20:25.16 --> 01:20:27.96 That brings us up to chapter 10
01:20:29.04 --> 01:20:31.04 Which is titled
01:20:31.04 --> 01:20:38.76 Kennedy's Army of gladiators and the counter insurgency that blunted their swords then cleared the way for another
01:20:38.76 --> 01:20:43.000 Contender that goes getting to kick out of that one
01:20:44.28 --> 01:20:46.28 and
01:20:46.28 --> 01:20:51.80 You know you talk about the fact that this was a really hard chapter chapter for you to write
01:20:52.92 --> 01:20:54.92 And you
01:20:54.92 --> 01:20:59.52 This is this is the and it makes sense that it's hard to write because you got the special forces
01:20:59.96 --> 01:21:01.96 Yeah, which
01:21:01.96 --> 01:21:05.76 By all means look if the Marine Corps isn't gonna make some kind of a
01:21:05.76 --> 01:21:12.56 Maritime special operations go anywhere forced then if the if the Marine Corps is not gonna do that
01:21:13.04 --> 01:21:17.36 Then certainly the Army special forces should become
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000 This capability and
01:21:20.56 --> 01:21:22.56 It's a very bizarre
01:21:22.56 --> 01:21:24.96 I could bizarre as a strong word. It's a very interesting
01:21:26.32 --> 01:21:29.84 Thing that drives them in a different direction right
01:21:29.84 --> 01:21:38.12 Yeah, I mean it's it's totally unpredictable. I mean they they create them in 1952 sort of right after the failure of the Virginia one raid
01:21:38.12 --> 01:21:42.56 But they see the potential of partisans or they see the potential of guerrilla forces. I mean
01:21:43.12 --> 01:21:45.44 The one disadvantage that the West has
01:21:46.40 --> 01:21:48.40 Compared to the communist forces
01:21:49.28 --> 01:21:54.16 The Soviet Union are you know, we don't have as many men we just don't have the man power so
01:21:54.80 --> 01:21:57.04 or at least in the in the military we don't so
01:21:57.04 --> 01:22:03.52 Our idea or the the idea of special forces is to be able to you know parachute
01:22:03.52 --> 01:22:07.04 You know behind enemy lines and raise a guerrilla force to
01:22:07.92 --> 01:22:09.92 Ray the enemy's vulnerable spaces
01:22:10.32 --> 01:22:13.72 The problem that they you know discover in this period between
01:22:14.44 --> 01:22:19.20 1952 and 1962 as at the Soviet Union is not like other countries. It's not like the West
01:22:19.20 --> 01:22:24.56 If you want to you know create a partisan force and central Colorado you might be able to do it
01:22:24.56 --> 01:22:29.20 You might be able to find some you know wing nuts out there and raise a militia and you know go attack
01:22:29.44 --> 01:22:33.68 You know oil plants or whatever you could probably do that because we have an open society
01:22:33.68 --> 01:22:36.08 That's because I that does happen. Yeah, right
01:22:36.64 --> 01:22:39.28 Yeah, but you know you can't do that in
01:22:39.84 --> 01:22:41.28 In a
01:22:41.28 --> 01:22:42.64 Gestapo state or so
01:22:42.64 --> 01:22:46.40 You know because they know they they've got identity cards on everybody. I mean you can't
01:22:47.20 --> 01:22:49.04 There's just not there's not the
01:22:49.60 --> 01:22:52.72 Infrastructure to be able to do that so the special forces
01:22:52.72 --> 01:22:57.52 You know have you know this idea that you're gonna have behind the lines Raiders made up of indigenous forces
01:22:57.52 --> 01:22:59.52 It's ridiculous so
01:23:00.16 --> 01:23:01.36 they
01:23:01.36 --> 01:23:04.000 Sense that they know that and they start to
01:23:04.88 --> 01:23:06.88 you know
01:23:06.88 --> 01:23:12.88 Of all of themselves they transform themselves into a completely sort of different unit which Kennedy finds out about or
01:23:13.44 --> 01:23:14.48 Sort of you know
01:23:14.48 --> 01:23:18.40 These two things are sort of happening at the same time Kennedy is discovering this
01:23:18.40 --> 01:23:22.88 Concept of counter-insurgency and the winning of hearts and minds and the
01:23:23.76 --> 01:23:25.76 the least if not
01:23:26.56 --> 01:23:30.64 the creation of a American freedom fighters at least denying
01:23:31.20 --> 01:23:34.40 Tribesmen and indigenous peoples to the Soviets
01:23:34.80 --> 01:23:40.56 So why don't we support these people why don't we you know give them weapons? Why don't we train them out of fight?
01:23:41.28 --> 01:23:44.32 And it becomes you know the perfect you know marriage of
01:23:44.32 --> 01:23:47.52 Capability and an opportunity
01:23:48.24 --> 01:23:50.64 Counter-insurgency and the special forces so
01:23:52.24 --> 01:23:55.04 They're married together and that leads us into Vietnam
01:23:56.16 --> 01:23:57.60 Yeah the the
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000 Transition these guys started off
01:24:00.24 --> 01:24:04.48 Where they started you know in the early 1950s
01:24:05.28 --> 01:24:06.24 Um
01:24:06.48 --> 01:24:12.000 It looks like they could hand up just be in a good commando force or a the creative commander for absolutely I mean
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:19.68 I'm going to the book here you say established in 1952 the special forces had been intended to replicate the experiences of its founder and first commander
01:24:19.76 --> 01:24:23.60 former OSS operative Colonel Aaron bank in 1944
01:24:24.24 --> 01:24:29.44 As a 41-year-old Jedberg he had dropped in a France led resistance fighters
01:24:30.16 --> 01:24:34.88 Then in 1945 his impropers at sounds had almost let an operational group of
01:24:35.84 --> 01:24:39.92 German POWs into the alps on a mission to capture Hitler
01:24:40.56 --> 01:24:41.92 Hell yeah
01:24:41.92 --> 01:24:45.20 Guided by these examples bank and his successors had erected and an
01:24:45.68 --> 01:24:51.12 Organization to match their mission 2000 airborne qualified soldiers spread across three forward staged
01:24:51.28 --> 01:24:57.20 Battalion-sized groups one in Okinawa one in Germany one in Fort Bragg North Carolina all ready at a moment
01:24:57.68 --> 01:25:05.76 Notice to drop into an enemy country and lead a ready band of resistance fighters to physically create these groups a special warfare
01:25:05.76 --> 01:25:11.12 Sender had been hacked out of a remote corner for Bragg in the mid 1950s and volunteers had been recruited
01:25:11.12 --> 01:25:16.000 Plenty of former Rangers old jockstrap type commandos
01:25:17.44 --> 01:25:27.76 No first enlistments or second lieutenant's permitted to apply the and ushered through a three month course in guerilla warfare with a staggering 90% drop-out rate
01:25:27.92 --> 01:25:32.96 This was followed by language instruction and individual courses in one of four specialties weapons
01:25:32.96 --> 01:25:41.04 Demolition radio communications and longest of all medicine the pipeline culminated with a multi-week exercise in which candidates infiltrated on a
01:25:42.24 --> 01:25:49.20 Notional enemy country linked up with a band of dissidents which are other can candidates sent up a hinterland base camp
01:25:49.44 --> 01:25:55.60 Imparded their individual specialties and it led their guerrillas on a series of raids and ambushes all why avoiding a
01:25:55.84 --> 01:25:59.44 Gresser force of local deputies National Guardsmen and state police
01:25:59.44 --> 01:26:03.44 There you go man
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.64 That's special forces. I mean that's what is it robin sage? Yes, it's
01:26:10.48 --> 01:26:14.64 And they still have it and they know still the ideas that you're gonna be able to
01:26:15.52 --> 01:26:21.20 lead or find these groups. I think that's the that's the that's the trick. How do you find these groups and
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.80 You know soviet societies or societies where you know you have a an aggressive
01:26:26.80 --> 01:26:35.04 You know Gestapo type police force you know you don't have a free society like and the only place that you're going to find
01:26:35.04 --> 01:26:39.92 You know a ready pool of candidates to you know join a thing like this is and
01:26:40.80 --> 01:26:45.28 You know sort of ungoverned spaces where there aren't you know these
01:26:47.36 --> 01:26:52.000 You know state police secret police what's the deal with yarboros daughter?
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.16 I was one of the you know things that I was uh
01:26:57.52 --> 01:26:59.52 So yarboros he he's the
01:27:01.20 --> 01:27:04.72 It was tough to find the character and this I always tried to you know
01:27:06.72 --> 01:27:13.36 When I was working on a chapter working on a different unit I was always trying to find you know one you know the operation that was
01:27:14.56 --> 01:27:19.12 You know most consequential to driving you know that missions either success or failure
01:27:19.12 --> 01:27:25.52 They're their their continuation their disbandment but then once I found the the operation or the the program or something
01:27:25.52 --> 01:27:27.12 I was always trying to find the character
01:27:27.44 --> 01:27:30.64 That was most important to that missions success or failure
01:27:31.44 --> 01:27:32.40 um
01:27:32.40 --> 01:27:33.92 yarboros
01:27:33.92 --> 01:27:37.92 This this chapter is distinct in one way. It's not there's no operation
01:27:38.48 --> 01:27:44.24 I'm covering lots of little mini battles. I mean wars changing at this point so you know the the sort of the
01:27:44.24 --> 01:27:50.72 The the the chapter structure that I had settled on in World War II and the Korean War you know
01:27:50.72 --> 01:27:52.72 Where I focus on one main
01:27:52.72 --> 01:27:58.64 Operations kind of gone at this point in the book because you know there's no one there's so many battles that are a
01:27:58.64 --> 01:28:04.08 Carrier so many little small skirmishes but you know I focus on yarboros because he's the person who
01:28:05.28 --> 01:28:09.68 He creates the special war fair center or the the schoolhouse for green berets
01:28:09.68 --> 01:28:16.000 um and and marries you know the green berets to this this new
01:28:17.92 --> 01:28:21.84 Operation of counterinsurgency so there's no more commando operations for the special forces
01:28:21.84 --> 01:28:25.68 No rating or anything like that. It's only coin or counterinsurgency
01:28:25.68 --> 01:28:31.60 So he's training guys not to just you know lead ambushes and things like that but he's teaching his guys to
01:28:32.48 --> 01:28:37.44 Dig wells and you know how you know animal husbandry and how do you how do you convince you know
01:28:37.44 --> 01:28:41.52 Tribal people you know to to join your your group you have to you know
01:28:41.52 --> 01:28:45.28 You've got to do med checks you've got to do all the sorts of things that nobody really likes to do
01:28:45.68 --> 01:28:46.72 um
01:28:46.72 --> 01:28:51.28 But in the course of him you know overhauling the special warfare center
01:28:51.84 --> 01:28:55.28 And in the course of him preparing to showcase this to
01:28:55.76 --> 01:28:57.60 Kennedy for Kennedy's visit to Fort Bragg
01:28:59.04 --> 01:29:01.52 his daughter who is about to
01:29:01.52 --> 01:29:08.64 Mary get married to another green beret officer she's in a terrible car accident dies
01:29:09.36 --> 01:29:11.36 She's killed and
01:29:12.40 --> 01:29:16.40 Yarbro is a month away from you know his you know career making
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:25.44 Presidential visit this is going to you know this visit is going to either make or break the the special forces everything and he's worked for
01:29:25.44 --> 01:29:32.80 Um and in that period he I write in the book he cinches down his grief and he gets back to work
01:29:32.80 --> 01:29:35.12 The first thing he does I managed to talk to
01:29:36.32 --> 01:29:42.32 I interviewed Yarbro's daughters fiance he never married after she was killed
01:29:43.76 --> 01:29:45.76 She would
01:29:45.92 --> 01:29:49.92 But he said the first thing that he didn't he talked to the the general
01:29:50.32 --> 01:29:54.40 Several times after his fiance was killed but the first thing that Yarbro
01:29:54.40 --> 01:29:59.76 Yarbro did after his wife died is the same day he went through the house and he took down every picture
01:29:59.76 --> 01:30:02.64 Or you mean after his daughter died after his daughter died he went through the house
01:30:02.64 --> 01:30:04.64 Yarbro did and he took down every picture
01:30:05.20 --> 01:30:07.60 God rid of every trace of her couldn't handle the grief
01:30:08.56 --> 01:30:11.28 Shut he just shut it down and then he
01:30:13.12 --> 01:30:14.40 Spent the next month
01:30:14.40 --> 01:30:16.72 doing everything he could deport himself into
01:30:18.48 --> 01:30:20.48 Getting ready for that presentation
01:30:20.48 --> 01:30:28.40 And Yarbro drove the special forces as you just said into not being a commando force
01:30:28.40 --> 01:30:36.40 But being up countering search is he force right which creates another gap of which which leaves the gap the gap remains
01:30:36.80 --> 01:30:38.80 the gap remains
01:30:38.80 --> 01:30:40.80 Now we end up with
01:30:41.76 --> 01:30:43.44 Chapter 11
01:30:43.44 --> 01:30:51.20 The first seals their search for a mission and the report that found it for them
01:30:52.40 --> 01:30:54.40 The bucklrew report
01:30:54.40 --> 01:30:56.40 What's going on
01:30:56.40 --> 01:30:57.20 So
01:30:57.20 --> 01:30:59.20 um, 1964 the navy
01:30:59.76 --> 01:31:01.20 um
01:31:01.20 --> 01:31:07.84 The navy seeing that there is you know trouble in south of East Asia and once to contribute but does not know how
01:31:08.40 --> 01:31:10.40 the navy is run by
01:31:10.40 --> 01:31:12.40 um, traditional
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.72 Blue water sailors as it always is and
01:31:17.76 --> 01:31:19.04 And
01:31:19.04 --> 01:31:24.32 Is trying to figure out how to contribute to this, you know conflict and they and they they gather together
01:31:25.44 --> 01:31:28.48 seven seven naval officers led by a
01:31:30.64 --> 01:31:33.52 A blue water sailor animal savage they
01:31:33.52 --> 01:31:40.96 Send the survey team to Vietnam to you know get away at the land figure out how the navy can contribute
01:31:42.56 --> 01:31:44.56 It's
01:31:45.68 --> 01:31:52.08 The group itself is you know comprised of a lot of the navies kind of unconventional thinkers
01:31:53.68 --> 01:31:56.64 David Del Jutus who is the first commanding officer of seal team one
01:31:57.20 --> 01:32:00.56 He's there sort of acting as a contributor slash
01:32:00.56 --> 01:32:02.56 Ademnol's aid
01:32:02.88 --> 01:32:07.28 There's a former UDT officer a silver star winner and there's
01:32:07.84 --> 01:32:12.24 Phil Bucklrew and several others who have spent considerable time in Vietnam
01:32:12.72 --> 01:32:17.28 So, Philip and Phil Bucklrew at this point is he he's a captain or no six
01:32:18.40 --> 01:32:20.40 He's the second in command
01:32:20.40 --> 01:32:28.72 They're there for less than a week when Admiral Savage has a not sure the record is unclear he has either a heart episode or he
01:32:30.64 --> 01:32:34.96 He gets into an alcohol-related incident and is forced to
01:32:35.52 --> 01:32:37.52 Retire back to the states
01:32:38.08 --> 01:32:44.000 Regardless it leaves Phil Bucklrew in charge of the survey team now what would have happened if Admiral Savage had
01:32:44.48 --> 01:32:48.16 Remained in his position as the as the survey leader. I don't know
01:32:48.16 --> 01:32:51.84 But what we do know is what did happen and that's Phil Bucklrew who is the
01:32:52.88 --> 01:32:54.88 the most
01:32:55.44 --> 01:32:57.44 Forward leaning or
01:32:59.52 --> 01:33:03.68 You know the the person who's still in the military who has
01:33:04.48 --> 01:33:06.48 experienced every unconventional
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.48 phase of the navy sort of inland adventurism
01:33:10.72 --> 01:33:13.20 He's now in charge of this the survey team
01:33:13.68 --> 01:33:17.92 They spend six weeks you know going around the entire country they go to civil
01:33:17.92 --> 01:33:19.92 Special forces camps
01:33:19.92 --> 01:33:21.92 They they travel up the Mecon River
01:33:22.48 --> 01:33:24.48 They examine
01:33:24.08 --> 01:33:30.16 Where supplies are coming in if they're as the navy is contending or as the navy argues that they're being
01:33:30.72 --> 01:33:32.32 sailed down
01:33:32.32 --> 01:33:34.72 Around the coast and infiltrated
01:33:35.60 --> 01:33:37.60 along along the the ocean coast
01:33:39.76 --> 01:33:45.28 And what they figure out is that none of that is happening none of the the navy's claims are are true
01:33:45.28 --> 01:33:47.28 All of the
01:33:47.44 --> 01:33:52.88 Contraband all the weapons that are being funneled to the insurgency are coming right down that Mecon River and they're being
01:33:53.44 --> 01:33:56.72 Injected throughout the country through various waterways
01:33:57.20 --> 01:34:02.64 He discovers this and says we are not going to have an impact if the navy
01:34:03.20 --> 01:34:05.92 Doesn't leave blue water and starts doing what the
01:34:07.04 --> 01:34:11.20 The fleet did in the American Civil War and that's hitting hitting the brown water rivers
01:34:11.20 --> 01:34:13.20 um
01:34:13.76 --> 01:34:20.88 And it in the report, you know, he makes a point to say that you know there's lots of opportunities for rating along these rivers
01:34:21.28 --> 01:34:25.12 He only mentions the seals once never really connects them to that idea rating
01:34:26.48 --> 01:34:30.000 But he he does you know say explicitly in the report
01:34:32.32 --> 01:34:34.32 The navy
01:34:34.32 --> 01:34:39.04 Should be in charge of that inland rating mission and
01:34:39.04 --> 01:34:42.16 And when the reports delivered
01:34:42.80 --> 01:34:49.44 It's sort of the in the whole process of this like everybody's trying to get a hold of his report before he
01:34:52.24 --> 01:34:56.72 Publishes it before he takes it back to the navy Paul Harkins who's in charge of
01:34:57.52 --> 01:34:59.04 Mac Vee at the time
01:34:59.04 --> 01:35:03.92 His deputy William Westmoreland they're all trying they're having lunch with him Henry Cavitt lodge is the
01:35:03.92 --> 01:35:08.96 The ambassador to Vietnam everybody's trying to get a look at Phil Buckley's report
01:35:09.28 --> 01:35:14.08 Phil Buckley to his credit. He does not want to let this thing out of his hands until he has a chance to let his
01:35:14.64 --> 01:35:19.44 Navy superior see it first. It's you know, it's still controversial like
01:35:20.48 --> 01:35:24.88 You know the navy like I said the navy hadn't been involved in a war like that for
01:35:25.84 --> 01:35:27.84 Over over a hundred years
01:35:27.84 --> 01:35:36.64 Um, sir, Shane it's controversial because of that it's controversial because he's advocating for you know this this this this river reenforce
01:35:36.96 --> 01:35:45.76 This this force that's going to take us away from the blue water away from you know the navy's emphasis at that point which is aircraft and air care and and aircraft carriers and
01:35:46.88 --> 01:35:51.28 And nuclear subs and everything like that you're you're you're putting us back in the weeds
01:35:52.72 --> 01:35:54.72 But having been you know the
01:35:54.72 --> 01:36:01.52 A veteran of the scouts and raiders and then veteran of sake. And then a
01:36:03.04 --> 01:36:05.04 In charge of the navy's
01:36:06.96 --> 01:36:10.96 Relationship with the CIA during the Korean war and all the various CIA raids
01:36:11.60 --> 01:36:17.28 With the UDTs in the Korean war. I mean he is he's positioned. I mean he's he's
01:36:17.92 --> 01:36:22.000 He's taking his biography and he's saying well, why shouldn't we be doing this?
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.96 I've experienced two wars where we've done this already
01:36:25.76 --> 01:36:32.08 We we absolutely should be trying to support this effort as much as possible if the government or if the country has decided this is worth
01:36:32.64 --> 01:36:34.64 American lines then it should be
01:36:35.04 --> 01:36:37.04 It should be a mission worth
01:36:37.44 --> 01:36:42.40 Navy lives as well and he delivers that report to just unmelt and
01:36:42.96 --> 01:36:47.76 They Commander and chief the Pacific fleet. They're they're head over heels in love with this thing. No
01:36:48.24 --> 01:36:51.12 They're not head over heels. They they this report gets
01:36:51.12 --> 01:36:55.76 Past back and forth. I mean it becomes like I said in the book it becomes a bit of a hot potato
01:36:55.76 --> 01:36:57.76 Where does it get traction?
01:36:58.16 --> 01:37:04.32 It all I'm not sure where it ultimately gets traction because it takes two years for the really the navy to
01:37:04.56 --> 01:37:10.48 You know put this thing into effect before they field you know the navy river reenforce or CTF 1116
01:37:10.72 --> 01:37:13.60 Combine task force one six was there a champion for an above
01:37:14.32 --> 01:37:16.96 Phil H. Bucklew not that I could find
01:37:17.28 --> 01:37:19.28 interesting but everybody
01:37:19.28 --> 01:37:21.28 I
01:37:23.60 --> 01:37:29.68 If if I had to guess I would guess it was probably somebody like Norville Norville Ward who becomes more important later
01:37:31.92 --> 01:37:38.64 But I'm not sure I didn't find them one other part of this chapter that I wanted to run through because it's
01:37:40.16 --> 01:37:46.000 Pretty freaking awesome is this at some point the navy sends down some some
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000 Like
01:37:49.04 --> 01:37:53.68 Academics and some some psychologists and so so I got to read this part
01:37:55.12 --> 01:38:00.08 When the navy's academics had arrived in 1955 to observe UDT training
01:38:00.32 --> 01:38:02.80 Their purpose had been to validate the courses
01:38:03.04 --> 01:38:09.52 Individual selection tests the soft sand runs the ocean swims the harassment of hell week
01:38:10.24 --> 01:38:14.000 And short of invalidating any of these to develop what they called
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.20 Realistic selection standards that would reduce what the navy admitted was the courses
01:38:19.84 --> 01:38:21.04 excessive
01:38:21.04 --> 01:38:23.04 attrition
01:38:23.04 --> 01:38:28.32 Subjecting students to a battery of personality tests and classifying their individual traits
01:38:28.96 --> 01:38:36.16 Age education intelligence and so on the academics hopes not only to predict the candidates like the hood of success and training
01:38:36.40 --> 01:38:40.08 But also his success in an actual underwater demolition team
01:38:40.08 --> 01:38:48.80 In the course of these assessments they learn that the students below the age of 21 were 8% more likely to fail
01:38:49.36 --> 01:38:51.84 Roughly the same rate as high school dropouts
01:38:53.12 --> 01:38:57.44 While students from broken homes were just as likely to graduate as anyone else
01:38:58.56 --> 01:39:03.28 Based on the number of times a student had volunteered to visit the dispensary
01:39:04.72 --> 01:39:09.12 Which is medical assessors determined that a candidate in moderate health who
01:39:09.12 --> 01:39:15.28 Minimize the psychological importance of pain, fatigue and intense discomfort
01:39:15.76 --> 01:39:18.48 Study much higher chance of success than
01:39:18.72 --> 01:39:23.52 quote the most physically fit who were over concerned about their injuries
01:39:24.32 --> 01:39:25.92 So you're better off just being a tough
01:39:26.64 --> 01:39:32.80 Son of a bitch that maybe can't run too quick, but I don't care if my knee hurts. I'm gonna keep going
01:39:32.80 --> 01:39:40.48 The least common traits among successful frog men seem to be restraint
01:39:41.76 --> 01:39:46.08 Fautfulness sociability and cautiousness
01:39:48.32 --> 01:39:51.52 The most common were responsibility
01:39:51.52 --> 01:39:53.36 Emotional stability
01:39:53.36 --> 01:39:55.20 Original thinking
01:39:55.20 --> 01:39:58.96 Objectivity and most of all masculinity
01:39:58.96 --> 01:40:03.52 So you know as I read through that, I mean, it just you just
01:40:04.16 --> 01:40:09.12 Picture every team guy that you know and you know where the bell curve is and
01:40:10.40 --> 01:40:12.40 Yeah, I mean I
01:40:12.88 --> 01:40:14.40 I have a
01:40:14.40 --> 01:40:20.000 I knew that this had to get in the book. I bounced it around from section to section because I had about you know 15 years
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.52 You know to play with I finally you know found a home for it here and I was I was really happy that I did
01:40:25.52 --> 01:40:31.04 There's lots of these little like assessments that they had put together over the years and they were trying to like understand
01:40:31.04 --> 01:40:34.72 And they still try and understand but still they still do and they still have no idea no idea
01:40:35.76 --> 01:40:38.16 That's that's why it's so great because it's just I mean
01:40:38.96 --> 01:40:44.64 This is a report down in 1955 we're still at this we still have no like the Navy still says hey
01:40:44.64 --> 01:40:47.76 Why can't you figure out who's gonna make a wise nutrition rates or how they still said?
01:40:47.76 --> 01:40:51.36 I mean the trussian rate right now is insane but it did say at the
01:40:52.16 --> 01:40:54.16 10-15
01:40:54.16 --> 01:41:00.64 Are making it through it continues on later studies had gone on to test a variety of variables
01:41:01.20 --> 01:41:04.96 Including the benefits of wheat germ and a student diet which proved predictive
01:41:05.28 --> 01:41:10.24 Preditably negligible and a series of warshacked tests and psych psychiatric
01:41:10.32 --> 01:41:14.56 Interviews to determine the effective sexuality on a candidate success or failure
01:41:15.20 --> 01:41:20.72 Successful frog men said the sex reports author appeared to require this specific rather
01:41:20.72 --> 01:41:26.96 masculine at adventurous occupation with all of itself destructive and massacistic implications
01:41:27.76 --> 01:41:34.80 Because and this was just the author's speculation of their magical attraction to the depth of the sea and the security of the womb
01:41:35.28 --> 01:41:41.52 And an unconscious motivation to prove their masculinity coupled with a fear of involvement with women
01:41:41.52 --> 01:41:45.88 Ha ha ha ha
01:41:46.38 --> 01:41:55.28 Setting aside the psychoanalyst tendency to project their own insecurities onto their subjects the Navy had not been able to argue with the UDTs results
01:41:56.08 --> 01:41:57.28 That was not the worst thing
01:41:57.28 --> 01:41:59.28 Call it in there
01:42:00.48 --> 01:42:04.96 I have never met a group of more self-reliant health-releather
01:42:04.96 --> 01:42:13.68 Characters wrote reporter Bill Stapleton after accompanying a UDT to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands in 1955
01:42:14.16 --> 01:42:17.28 Besides their typical raconicence exercise
01:42:18.08 --> 01:42:24.16 Exercises submarine lockouts and test with miniature submersibles the frog men had also
01:42:24.96 --> 01:42:32.96 Salvaged a 50 foot yacht from a reef twisted the tails of passing sharks and when an American sailor had disappeared into the harbor on a moonless night
01:42:32.96 --> 01:42:42.64 Had common deer to truck road to the worst edge and as if they'd been scouting the contours of an enemy beach dove online until they found the drowned man
01:42:43.28 --> 01:42:52.96 In their free time they spearfished drank untold amounts of beer erected beachside bonfires and in overflowing pots of sea water
01:42:53.68 --> 01:43:00.88 And vinegar boiled lobsters and astonished the superstitious natives by broiling barracuda steaks
01:43:00.88 --> 01:43:05.44 U.E. barracuda barracuda e.e. you they had said
01:43:06.08 --> 01:43:09.28 Promises replied a frog band nothing but promises
01:43:10.48 --> 01:43:16.32 So exclusive were the UDTs said one observer that even rank met nothing to them
01:43:17.20 --> 01:43:24.56 When seen in their standard swim trunks and belt nifes surrounded by charts and diving equipment and asked by passerby
01:43:24.56 --> 01:43:32.16 If they were indeed in the navy the frog men would invariably reply regardless of the askers rank nope
01:43:32.88 --> 01:43:34.88 We're all in UDT
01:43:40.16 --> 01:43:42.16 So there you go
01:43:42.16 --> 01:43:44.16 I went to St. Thomas one time
01:43:45.36 --> 01:43:47.20 Yeah, and it sounds about like this
01:43:47.20 --> 01:43:54.08 We've rented a room so we were doing training in Puerto Rico and I think we got
01:43:55.60 --> 01:44:01.52 We got a little we chartered a plane and bro this is like nineteen ninety whatever
01:44:01.52 --> 01:44:05.68 I mean this is not when you people are chartering planes. I don't know who pulled this together
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.96 We chartered a plane we go to St. Thomas
01:44:10.32 --> 01:44:12.80 We get there that place is beautiful by the way
01:44:12.80 --> 01:44:19.44 But we went we've got an 18 man we were we're an arg puttune we've got an 18 man puttune so
01:44:19.84 --> 01:44:25.76 I'm pretty sure everyone went but most of us went we got a bunch of guys most of the puttune we ran one
01:44:27.36 --> 01:44:29.36 Hotel room
01:44:29.36 --> 01:44:34.48 For everyone to stay and because you know we're all cheap and besides who's planning on sleeping when we're gonna be
01:44:35.60 --> 01:44:42.16 Long story short when I get back to the hotel room at seven or eight o'clock in the morning on Saturday morning
01:44:42.16 --> 01:44:45.20 There's all these guys are sleeping
01:44:45.92 --> 01:44:51.20 There was someone that had pulled because it was air conditioning in the little hotel we were saying
01:44:51.36 --> 01:44:58.40 So two guys had pulled the curtains off like ripped the curtains off the curtain rods and we're rolled up in the curtain rods
01:44:58.40 --> 01:45:00.40 I'd like it some more
01:45:00.80 --> 01:45:02.80 I can punch it just sandwiches
01:45:04.40 --> 01:45:10.40 So really not that much has changed the young UDT spirit survives
01:45:10.40 --> 01:45:12.40 um
01:45:15.68 --> 01:45:22.40 And meanwhile this report that you that you talked about is is circulating and now we're starting to get some
01:45:23.12 --> 01:45:25.12 some traction and
01:45:25.12 --> 01:45:27.12 starting to figure out
01:45:27.44 --> 01:45:29.44 What's going on
01:45:29.44 --> 01:45:31.44 chapter 12
01:45:31.44 --> 01:45:32.08 chapter 12
01:45:32.08 --> 01:45:40.24 Which is called the damn break of conventional war in Vietnam and the following flood of raiders that failed to beat the navy to the
01:45:40.24 --> 01:45:43.28 Macon delta all but one
01:45:45.84 --> 01:45:47.84 That's impressive right now. Go
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000 Let me get into this one a little bit
01:45:53.92 --> 01:45:59.12 The CIA had already discovered there were challenges at attempting to break a wild herd of mustangs
01:45:59.12 --> 01:46:04.32 These are Vietnamese soldiers that they're trying to train chain into wearing a warriors award
01:46:04.32 --> 01:46:10.96 Cheeriet yoke the CIA's initial solution to this mustang breaking was as usual to outsource the job to the
01:46:10.96 --> 01:46:17.36 US military's trainers at advisors in this case however the CIA's planners did not offer the job to their stand-by-pool
01:46:17.36 --> 01:46:23.36 Special forces a teams but instead took a long shot chance on a three-man element from seal team one
01:46:23.92 --> 01:46:31.60 A gamble due to the elements leader a man who had convinced the CIA planners that he was the equivalent of an entire special forces a team
01:46:31.60 --> 01:46:33.60 He
01:46:33.60 --> 01:46:42.88 Almost was with a boxers jab that could part the red sea said one who saw it and a six foot three inch frame that could have waited through it
01:46:43.76 --> 01:46:49.68 It had been natural to assume that storekeeper first class Robert Wagner's most likely
01:46:49.68 --> 01:46:52.96 Contribution to the seal teams would have been in pure
01:46:53.20 --> 01:46:55.20 Pugilistic combat
01:46:55.76 --> 01:47:01.28 His instincts for it were undeniable driving a Jeep through a Mac V compound and passing
01:47:01.28 --> 01:47:06.32 So close to an army sergeant that the offended man had taken a swing at Wagner's lieutenant
01:47:07.12 --> 01:47:08.80 In the passenger seat
01:47:08.80 --> 01:47:15.92 Wagner had responded by slamming on the brakes then beating the sergeant so savagely that the lieutenant had feared for the man's life
01:47:16.88 --> 01:47:19.68 I never saw anything like that the lieutenant said later
01:47:20.32 --> 01:47:24.000 Not an uncommon expression whenever Wagner was around
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:31.36 As one of the only enlisted UDT are graduates of that period to be selected to skip the mandatory
01:47:31.36 --> 01:47:38.40 Stn and UDT for a direct assignment to a seal team Bob Wagner despite a wife and four young children had
01:47:38.40 --> 01:47:45.44 Predictedably risen to become one of the team's most eager volunteers for repeat deployments to the ben high and
01:47:45.68 --> 01:47:46.96 LDNN
01:47:46.96 --> 01:47:49.52 Three six-month tours in three years
01:47:49.52 --> 01:47:55.12 In his role he had earned a reputation among superiors that had swung between the
01:47:55.12 --> 01:47:56.48 Supportalatives of
01:47:56.48 --> 01:47:59.68 Perfectionist advisor and perfect seal
01:47:59.68 --> 01:48:06.72 Reputations he had cultivated while simultaneously building a name as a weiler dealer for his part ownership of a
01:48:06.72 --> 01:48:09.60 Beachside bar in Denang called the blue moon
01:48:10.64 --> 01:48:18.32 Clean cut for a seal even by 1960 standards his face a graph of hard angles and straight lines
01:48:18.32 --> 01:48:26.24 Below a flat top deliberately raked to attention his only physical feature that suggested he was anything more than a lockstep
01:48:26.40 --> 01:48:28.40 Conventional where his eyes
01:48:28.64 --> 01:48:36.76 Hard focused a bit like a predator in pursuit of its prey and implying a similar pace
01:48:39.92 --> 01:48:41.92 Dude you're a good freaking writer, man
01:48:41.92 --> 01:48:46.000 I mean that's just an awesome
01:48:46.88 --> 01:48:48.88 An awesome little
01:48:48.88 --> 01:48:54.72 Little section there so we got the Mac Vsog we got four Sri Kahn going on we got the lurbs we got the PR use
01:48:55.60 --> 01:48:57.60 Yeah, it's a tough one. This is a tough
01:48:59.36 --> 01:49:06.72 Period to cover because all this stuff is happening all simultaneously this is the one chapter that sort of stands alone and the
01:49:06.72 --> 01:49:13.44 And all my chapters. They don't focus on one person I focus on you know four distinct
01:49:14.16 --> 01:49:18.32 Junus probably the most important being the one you just read Bob Wagner who is
01:49:22.56 --> 01:49:25.36 He is he's a tough character to to
01:49:27.68 --> 01:49:30.56 Compress and to you know it's it's
01:49:30.56 --> 01:49:42.000 It's difficult you know to you know highlight seals that were you know standouts or I mean it's a it's a it's a standout group already
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:48.48 I mean the you know the guys that are selected from UTT to come to the seal teams they were the they're the best guys in UTT
01:49:49.44 --> 01:49:55.12 And then to you know figure out who the best guys in the seal teams were at this point is also difficult
01:49:55.44 --> 01:49:59.60 But then you know look at somebody like Wagner who kind of stands above everybody
01:49:59.60 --> 01:50:01.60 You know in his
01:50:03.60 --> 01:50:05.60 One his foresight
01:50:05.92 --> 01:50:08.56 But his his ability to you know
01:50:09.20 --> 01:50:15.20 You use everything all the all the tools that he has and his personality everything from straight force
01:50:15.76 --> 01:50:17.76 I mean he
01:50:17.76 --> 01:50:19.76 in the course of his
01:50:20.96 --> 01:50:27.76 Creation of the PR you camp lots of different entities come into trying to steal this from him and he uses a variety of
01:50:27.76 --> 01:50:31.92 Ways to keep them out one you just threatens to kick their ass
01:50:32.64 --> 01:50:33.84 to
01:50:33.84 --> 01:50:37.84 He you know like I say in the book he threatens just you know pack up his bags and go home
01:50:37.84 --> 01:50:41.04 Which you know convinces the CIA planners to push everybody else aside
01:50:41.76 --> 01:50:43.76 he
01:50:44.80 --> 01:50:46.80 So he's
01:50:46.80 --> 01:50:51.68 You know all while he's doing that while he's building this program and nobody else is building and he's just
01:50:51.68 --> 01:50:55.68 I mean he's running from place to place to place he's participating in missions
01:50:55.68 --> 01:51:01.04 He's conducting rifle range training himself. He's managing his own bar
01:51:02.16 --> 01:51:08.24 He you know he doesn't I mean he he created the one bar the blue moon and the Nang but he also creates a separate bar down
01:51:08.48 --> 01:51:13.36 He's like franchise and liquor places. I mean he's like in some sense he's the you know
01:51:13.36 --> 01:51:16.64 He's the the 1966 version of jockel
01:51:17.68 --> 01:51:19.68 He's just I mean he's completely
01:51:21.28 --> 01:51:23.28 But he's
01:51:23.28 --> 01:51:27.12 And you know the whole time he's got you know family with the five kids, you know
01:51:27.12 --> 01:51:31.92 You know home but he's like he'll come home for six months. He'll deploy for six months. I'll come home for six months
01:51:31.92 --> 01:51:37.52 I mean he's just he's relentless and by this point you know in his career he's already done six
01:51:37.84 --> 01:51:39.84 separate tours to Vietnam
01:51:39.84 --> 01:51:41.84 like he's he's incomparable
01:51:44.56 --> 01:51:47.68 While he's doing that while he's where did you get most of your information about him from?
01:51:48.80 --> 01:51:50.80 there were
01:51:50.80 --> 01:51:54.80 um decent amount of well he he did a recording
01:51:56.88 --> 01:52:03.68 To capture this entire creation he did it with a Franklin Anderson so Franklin Anderson was
01:52:04.32 --> 01:52:09.76 his commanding officer at Celté one. He finds out what Wagner has been doing and
01:52:10.72 --> 01:52:12.72 things that Wagner has been kind of
01:52:13.36 --> 01:52:17.84 You know exceeding the boundaries of what he was been allowed to do so
01:52:18.56 --> 01:52:20.56 Wagner
01:52:20.56 --> 01:52:25.44 sits down with an interviewer that he commissioned himself and he explains the whole thing
01:52:25.44 --> 01:52:28.32 He's not gonna take his time to write down everything he did but he's like
01:52:28.32 --> 01:52:31.44 you want to talk to me about this bring an interviewer here and then you can take the
01:52:31.44 --> 01:52:35.84 transcript back to uh Anderson and he does it he he
01:52:35.84 --> 01:52:41.36 Trans the the whole thing is recorded he transcribes the thing and passes it back to the Celté one commander
01:52:41.36 --> 01:52:45.28 Anderson Anderson reads the thing and becomes his greatest advocate at that point
01:52:46.56 --> 01:52:49.28 So yeah he did break all the rules to make this happen but he didn't
01:52:49.28 --> 01:52:53.60 It's a good little leadership thing sometimes when you're in a leadership position
01:52:55.12 --> 01:52:59.68 And you're watching something happen from the outside and it looks a certain way
01:53:00.48 --> 01:53:02.48 And it's pretty easy to get caught up in it
01:53:02.48 --> 01:53:06.32 You don't necessarily even have to be a leadership position but like you know let's say you're watching a different unit
01:53:06.32 --> 01:53:10.48 You know I'm watching a Marine Corps unit see what they're doing from afar and I think what the hell of these guys doing
01:53:11.76 --> 01:53:13.92 And you if you don't if you're not careful
01:53:14.32 --> 01:53:19.20 You can look at someone from a distance and start to be very judgmental without actually understanding anything
01:53:19.20 --> 01:53:21.20 Of that that's going on in the ground
01:53:21.36 --> 01:53:25.68 So that's something I always tried to be very careful of if I was watching a unit
01:53:25.68 --> 01:53:31.92 They were doing something that didn't seem to make sense to me instead of me going to bend over there like an idiot running these operations
01:53:31.92 --> 01:53:33.92 I would actually reach out to them
01:53:34.64 --> 01:53:36.88 Did you say hey Ben can you explain to me what's going on?
01:53:36.88 --> 01:53:41.04 It looks like you're doing some wild stuff. Can you talk to me talking me through why it's happening?
01:53:41.84 --> 01:53:43.84 That's a mistake that
01:53:43.84 --> 01:53:45.36 That that people make and
01:53:45.36 --> 01:53:50.80 You have to be careful of it and that's a great example of what do you do if you think somebody's well
01:53:50.80 --> 01:53:56.16 Well, you should do it go talk to him go find out what's going on and you know what maybe you do see something that maybe I do say hey Ben
01:53:56.32 --> 01:53:59.20 You start telling me how you're doing it. I say hey, but you might want to think about this
01:53:59.20 --> 01:54:02.000 You're well, that's a good point. You know, or maybe I say oh wow
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.56 I I understand now what you're you know
01:54:04.56 --> 01:54:07.68 We had a little bit of this with doing daytime operations in Ramadi
01:54:08.48 --> 01:54:09.68 Uh
01:54:09.68 --> 01:54:15.000 Why the hell are seals doing daytime operations and it's like I could completely
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:23.24 Understand someone thinking that right what what you doing why you giving up your advantage of doing operations at night when we have night vision in the enemy doesn't
01:54:23.80 --> 01:54:29.16 You hate that's a great point. Here's the thing we are our our actual mission
01:54:30.12 --> 01:54:35.96 Tasking from the siege of Soutif is to train and fight company and puttune sized elements of Iraqi soldiers
01:54:36.84 --> 01:54:38.52 Guess what they don't have
01:54:38.52 --> 01:54:40.52 night vision matter fact
01:54:40.52 --> 01:54:45.000 They would have about one flashlight for every four guys
01:54:45.72 --> 01:54:50.04 So taking these guys out in the middle of the night was dangerous and
01:54:51.40 --> 01:54:54.68 Did we do it? Yes, we did we did it usually
01:54:55.40 --> 01:55:01.32 In direct action raids where we could set up a situation where white light was okay because we had already
01:55:02.20 --> 01:55:06.36 You know set off a breach or whatever and now we're just clearing buildings or they're just clearing buildings
01:55:06.36 --> 01:55:12.20 But we we we we had to get the in order to fight these guys in order to get them out on the battlefield
01:55:12.20 --> 01:55:14.92 They're gonna have to do stuff in the day. That's part one part two is
01:55:16.12 --> 01:55:20.12 We owned the night and you know who knew that the enemy knew that and so guess what the enemy did at night
01:55:20.12 --> 01:55:23.000 They didn't do anything at night. We'd go out at night. There'd be no one out there
01:55:23.40 --> 01:55:29.72 Literally no one doing anything but as soon as the day came out or as soon as the the sun came up and they're called a prayer went then it was oh
01:55:30.52 --> 01:55:36.04 Here comes the enemy because they know they it's a more even match and now they're out there moving amongst the civilian
01:55:36.04 --> 01:55:42.28 Populous two who's also awake and has to go you know down to the down to the corner store to grab some
01:55:43.24 --> 01:55:47.88 Date from the from his neighbor whatever they start moving around so now the enemy can move around
01:55:48.52 --> 01:55:51.32 with the camouflage of the local populace
01:55:52.68 --> 01:55:55.80 Now if I was on the outside see and what the hell is tasking a bruiser?
01:55:55.80 --> 01:56:00.12 After doing daytime operations it might not make sense as soon as you get an explanation like that it's like okay
01:56:00.68 --> 01:56:05.16 Okay, I get it. There's some there's some reason for this happening
01:56:05.16 --> 01:56:11.40 So that's a good lesson that got learned right there someone's doing something that seems a little bit crazy
01:56:12.68 --> 01:56:15.000 Ask him find out ask him why they're doing it
01:56:16.12 --> 01:56:22.68 What's it happens if we're gonna I mean Frank Lann Anderson is still around like he's and he is
01:56:23.72 --> 01:56:28.04 He's in his late 90s but he's still sharp of the tie. I talked to him
01:56:28.92 --> 01:56:33.56 Maybe a week ago cool what's get him on the podcast? He remembers
01:56:33.56 --> 01:56:39.40 Everything that's awesome. He's in Durango, Colorado and anytime I call
01:56:41.72 --> 01:56:49.000 You have to you know start leaving a message on the machine and just start talking because eventually his wife is gonna pick up and
01:56:49.40 --> 01:56:52.28 In variable he's gonna pick up and she's gonna like I didn't know who this was
01:56:53.72 --> 01:56:58.44 He's in the field you know clearing cows or something. He's always working what a beast
01:56:58.44 --> 01:57:03.000 He's incredible and he's a little guy. He's a but he's and he's still out there
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.28 And he's still like if I talked to him if I ask him a question. Okay, so was this guy at the team in
01:57:08.68 --> 01:57:10.52 1960s oh that guy was an E5 in
01:57:10.68 --> 01:57:12.68 196 I will he told you he was an E6 no
01:57:13.80 --> 01:57:19.56 How do you know this that's awesome? I use a he's a character but I got so
01:57:19.88 --> 01:57:23.000 The other answer to the other question about how I got some of this information about
01:57:23.48 --> 01:57:28.84 Bywagner I spent a lot of time talking to all the folks that he had done this with guy stone
01:57:28.84 --> 01:57:35.80 Retalked his son I talked to a lot of the a lot of the people that were you know sort of surrounding him at the time and he
01:57:37.08 --> 01:57:40.84 Not only is he you know does he build this PRU program
01:57:41.72 --> 01:57:47.32 And be a nom but he comes home and he builds you know sort of the counter part to the PRU program in the hills
01:57:48.12 --> 01:57:50.12 You know 200 miles away from the ocean
01:57:50.92 --> 01:57:53.16 in the chocolate mountains he you know
01:57:54.12 --> 01:57:56.12 Manages to convince
01:57:56.12 --> 01:58:01.72 A local real estate magnate to give like 12 hundred acres of mountain territory or mountain scrub
01:58:02.44 --> 01:58:04.44 He overhauls the entire area
01:58:04.44 --> 01:58:07.40 names that can't make him and then he
01:58:09.80 --> 01:58:16.76 He just creates a mini PRU camp to train guys how to train other people and delete them into combat
01:58:17.08 --> 01:58:19.40 He goes back on his last deployment
01:58:20.28 --> 01:58:22.28 he he's killed
01:58:22.28 --> 01:58:24.28 and
01:58:25.08 --> 01:58:27.08 and the
01:58:27.08 --> 01:58:32.76 Navy recognizes his contribution is you know he's a store he dies is a storekeeper first class
01:58:33.40 --> 01:58:37.88 Which for any of your listeners a storekeeper first class means he's essentially a
01:58:38.36 --> 01:58:40.36 Sergeant he's in the six
01:58:42.04 --> 01:58:44.84 Staff Sergeant staff Sergeant right he's a staff Sergeant and
01:58:46.36 --> 01:58:51.64 For his contribution for you know creating the period you know the Navy's contribution to the PRU program
01:58:51.64 --> 01:58:53.80 for creating everything he did in the United States
01:58:54.44 --> 01:59:01.08 The Navy awards him a legion of merit which is a totally like unheard of award for a first-class petty officer
01:59:01.48 --> 01:59:07.80 You know to get a two but the Navy authorizes the V of her valor with it. But she never happens
01:59:08.28 --> 01:59:15.56 So I mean one of the most highest you know awards that you can get you know one to a you know a storekeeper first class seal
01:59:15.56 --> 01:59:19.96 Um his family who I was able to interview they
01:59:21.72 --> 01:59:23.72 His last child was born
01:59:23.72 --> 01:59:26.20 Just prior to his last deployment
01:59:27.24 --> 01:59:31.56 There they were struggling to you know just comprehend you know their father's
01:59:32.44 --> 01:59:34.44 You know death and you know not having him anymore
01:59:35.64 --> 01:59:40.92 The Navy contacts them let's them know that he's going to be you know given this you know incredible honor
01:59:40.92 --> 01:59:47.24 And the Navy asks how if they would like to come out for the presentation of the the ceremony
01:59:48.76 --> 01:59:56.76 The wife asks the oldest son the the oldest of the the children who 16 years old if and leaves it in his hands
01:59:57.40 --> 01:59:59.40 Would you like to go out and receive your dad's award
02:00:00.52 --> 02:00:02.52 the son decides I
02:00:02.52 --> 02:00:04.52 Too much and says
02:00:04.52 --> 02:00:06.52 Just mail it
02:00:06.52 --> 02:00:12.52 I get it in the mail a couple weeks later
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000 Bang
02:00:15.80 --> 02:00:24.28 But this chapter is is not just about the peer use chapters all about the neglected not the neglect but you know the marine core deciding that they aren't gonna fight in the Mecon Delta
02:00:24.84 --> 02:00:30.76 And the the marine force recon deciding that they're going to support special forces on the on the
02:00:30.76 --> 02:00:37.48 CIDG camps and then the marine core deciding well, we don't really it's too risky to have those guys out there at the CIDG camps
02:00:37.48 --> 02:00:42.92 We're gonna keep them with the divisions then it's about the the lurps or the the creation of reconsons
02:00:44.36 --> 02:00:51.56 Troops to support the divisions whether it's the you know project Delta with the green berets or whether it's the the lurps with the individual
02:00:52.20 --> 02:00:57.64 Divisions both of these units are you know there they look like seals they probably act like seals
02:00:57.64 --> 02:01:05.40 They probably would have had the same sorts of missions as seals, you know in different parts of the country to go out find the enemy
02:01:05.48 --> 02:01:07.96 You know kill them capture people and bring them back
02:01:08.20 --> 02:01:16.60 But you know the emphasis of all of the divisions is to get these main these big forces into combat with the enemy so all they send them these guys out to do
02:01:16.60 --> 02:01:19.64 It's fine the enemy tells where he is and we'll send guys to you
02:01:20.20 --> 02:01:24.76 I mean, it's it doesn't work because you know, it's Vietnam and they you know small pockets of enemies
02:01:24.76 --> 02:01:29.16 You know if you don't contact them if you don't you know engage them whether they're they're gone
02:01:29.16 --> 02:01:31.56 They're gone. They're gone. When you make that
02:01:32.12 --> 02:01:36.36 Radio call now you got what however long it's gonna be they're gonna be gone. Right. They're gone
02:01:37.24 --> 02:01:41.000 And most important thing about this whole period is that all of these units that are created
02:01:42.12 --> 02:01:47.88 They're created in other parts of the country. They leave the one area of the country that has the most water as the most
02:01:48.44 --> 02:01:51.24 You know reason for the navy to be there completely
02:01:51.24 --> 02:01:54.20 Open open for another unit to come in
02:02:00.68 --> 02:02:04.04 Hoping for one unit to come in let's go to chapter 13
02:02:05.24 --> 02:02:12.52 The derailing of the first direct action seals in the wrong sat and the detachment that restored their prospects
02:02:14.76 --> 02:02:16.76 Going to the book here real quick
02:02:16.76 --> 02:02:22.28 When the seals of detachment delta or debt delta as it was called arrived in February
02:02:22.28 --> 02:02:23.96 1966
02:02:23.96 --> 02:02:29.72 They numbered just three officers and 15 enlisted men not much more than a single enhanced platoon
02:02:29.72 --> 02:02:35.56 But a platoon so important to seal aspirations that it was led by lieutenant James Barnes
02:02:36.12 --> 02:02:38.60 Seal team ones commanding officer
02:02:38.92 --> 02:02:45.40 Known as a friendly and capable administrator the ideal sort for foraging partnerships and acquiring
02:02:45.40 --> 02:02:54.52 In country assets Barnes was a firm believer in the seals traditional interpretation of direct action and upon arrival set to gathering
02:02:54.68 --> 02:02:59.64 Intelligence on all the enemies command posts radar dishes and bridges
02:03:00.76 --> 02:03:02.36 Barnes's problem
02:03:02.36 --> 02:03:04.36 These simply did not exist
02:03:05.48 --> 02:03:12.68 On a map the 400 or so square miles worth of rivers and canals of the wrong sat special zone
02:03:12.68 --> 02:03:14.68 Look like the splitting curving
02:03:15.88 --> 02:03:19.16 Broncos seen in the cross section of a human lung
02:03:19.80 --> 02:03:30.76 On the ground this lung was a putrid tide water swamp that went flushed left behind a morass of boot sucking mud flats and twisted root
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:36.60 Penicillus the high ground of which could mostly be measured above the water line with a yardstick
02:03:36.60 --> 02:03:47.80 Called the evil place by the locals or the forest of assassins by the Americans and was and known as it as a past hideout for pirates
02:03:48.12 --> 02:03:51.24 The wrong sat was by the time of the seals arrival
02:03:52.04 --> 02:03:54.36 Reinforcing all of these reputations
02:03:54.36 --> 02:04:04.92 Saved with since it was the source of an increasing number of rocket attacks on side gone plus river bank ambushes along sidegones main shipping channel
02:04:06.68 --> 02:04:08.36 So there you go
02:04:08.36 --> 02:04:12.76 Here comes this guy a Barnes rolling in like hey, we know we're gonna to take out their radar positions
02:04:12.76 --> 02:04:14.20 We're gonna take out their bridges
02:04:14.20 --> 02:04:18.52 That's what we're gonna do. Yeah, where are they they don't exist. It's not that kind of war
02:04:18.52 --> 02:04:25.24 I mean this the you know the example that you just used about you know getting to her body and
02:04:25.64 --> 02:04:32.36 You know expecting to contact the enemy and night and do everything like the one thing that I learned about frogmen or least
02:04:32.36 --> 02:04:35.64 You know this modern you know interpretation of them is
02:04:36.76 --> 02:04:43.32 They're gonna adapt to find the enemy and this is one instance where we don't and we we almost are the the seal team is almost
02:04:43.64 --> 02:04:46.68 You know got turned turned away at the front door
02:04:46.68 --> 02:04:51.80 And Barnes comes in like you said you know he finds that there's nothing that they've trained for
02:04:52.84 --> 02:05:00.44 And their and his response you know not not really you know not not having ever done this before or not having you know any real
02:05:01.64 --> 02:05:07.96 You know playbook you know to to work from he decides you know we're we're this isn't for us
02:05:10.12 --> 02:05:12.12 and
02:05:12.52 --> 02:05:13.72 The
02:05:13.72 --> 02:05:20.28 series of liberty incidents and Sue and the Navy is already you know kick the the kick the seals out of the country
02:05:20.28 --> 02:05:25.000 One you're not you're not engaging the enemy like we expected you to and two you're causing problems
02:05:25.48 --> 02:05:30.76 So what what do you want so they turn you know to the commander of all the
02:05:32.28 --> 02:05:37.96 Seals in country who just so happens to be the person responsible for putting them there fill bucklo
02:05:37.96 --> 02:05:42.68 So they they present this whole problem to them bucklo
02:05:44.28 --> 02:05:47.000 Appeals to the commander of Macvee's
02:05:48.20 --> 02:05:50.44 Understanding of the naval tradition of leadership
02:05:53.24 --> 02:05:57.88 Change the leader you're gonna change the rest of the organization so Barnes has removed
02:05:59.96 --> 02:06:03.88 After buckloos intercession and an entire new detachment replaces
02:06:03.88 --> 02:06:09.40 That Delta that is deck golf and deck golf the commander of deck golf is
02:06:11.48 --> 02:06:15.72 Juner officer by the name of of main requires comes in and
02:06:16.84 --> 02:06:21.88 Completely over halls what the seals are doing not over halls the mission
02:06:22.68 --> 02:06:25.48 Because you know the mission up to that point and really just been to
02:06:27.96 --> 02:06:32.76 You can go out into you know the country set ambushes where you could you know see if you could find the enemy
02:06:32.76 --> 02:06:36.76 Although they hadn't had any success but just because they hadn't had success
02:06:37.96 --> 02:06:42.28 Wires doesn't say that you know that's an excuse like I said you know in the book
02:06:43.08 --> 02:06:45.08 his
02:06:45.08 --> 02:06:51.000 His message to his man at the time was this is the only war in town. We're not going to let it go to waste
02:06:53.80 --> 02:07:01.08 And so he sends his guys out every night. It goes with him. I mean they're out in the muck in the misery of the the wrongs at special zone
02:07:01.08 --> 02:07:03.08 And
02:07:03.08 --> 02:07:05.08 Night after night whether you contact the enemy or not
02:07:05.48 --> 02:07:07.48 We're going to be going out
02:07:07.48 --> 02:07:13.88 So adapt yourself to that expectation and and that's the detachment that restored their prospects
02:07:14.36 --> 02:07:19.16 It does they I mean by the end of that deployment. I think they have something like 80 kills
02:07:20.12 --> 02:07:23.48 Most of them are from one single contact, but they I mean they
02:07:24.44 --> 02:07:29.56 They they they make things easier for themselves. They they create like a house boat
02:07:29.56 --> 02:07:32.44 Of a old world war two air landing craft
02:07:33.24 --> 02:07:38.36 They make it so they don't have to you know return to base so often they improve their living conditions
02:07:39.08 --> 02:07:42.76 They essentially just start going out for a few hours at a time
02:07:43.96 --> 02:07:45.96 Finding the enemy where we're we're possible
02:07:46.60 --> 02:07:48.60 Responding to
02:07:48.12 --> 02:07:52.52 Reports of an enemy contact and then you know patrolling to those areas
02:07:53.32 --> 02:07:57.32 And they get you know they're not you know this you know they're not what we understand to be this
02:07:57.32 --> 02:07:59.80 Heels today, but they're they're off the close
02:08:01.08 --> 02:08:03.08 What was the operation jacks day?
02:08:03.80 --> 02:08:09.88 Operation jacks day is a attempt it was a sort of a Marine Corps Navy mission right at the beginning right when
02:08:11.24 --> 02:08:12.92 debt
02:08:12.92 --> 02:08:15.64 debt dealt it gets in country and it's a
02:08:16.52 --> 02:08:20.68 Sort of a Marine Corps lead mission to sort of sweep this one
02:08:20.68 --> 02:08:26.36 Suspected corner of the rung sats specials on and it's a I
02:08:27.64 --> 02:08:30.12 Think they claim it you know to be this you know
02:08:31.24 --> 02:08:34.04 Huge success what in fact it's it's a bit of a disaster
02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.40 There's multiple heat casualties in the process
02:08:37.64 --> 02:08:44.04 There is a there are a couple of enemy kills and I think the only thing real that they find in the entire three week long
02:08:44.60 --> 02:08:46.60 mission is a
02:08:46.60 --> 02:08:50.84 A Vietcon hospital sort of a built-up section of a
02:08:52.12 --> 02:08:56.28 Log pathways and little huts and other than that they don't find much
02:08:58.12 --> 02:09:02.44 Seal teams try to contribute to it UDT is contribute to it the UDT is bring
02:09:03.48 --> 02:09:07.16 I cut a bit of a section of the book on operation jacks day
02:09:07.16 --> 02:09:15.88 It was it was mostly a litany of of failures by both the seals and the UDTs they had bad gear they had you know
02:09:16.44 --> 02:09:19.80 They just they they their contribution wasn't significant
02:09:20.92 --> 02:09:23.72 So and you mentioned Guy Stone
02:09:24.28 --> 02:09:31.64 When you're talking about Wagner what what was his guy stone he didn't get much in the book he gets a he gets a a brief
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000 You know nod and that's
02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000 He
02:09:37.80 --> 02:09:39.80 Helps
02:09:40.20 --> 02:09:43.88 He's he's Wagner's best friend who's Wagner's best friend in the world
02:09:45.24 --> 02:09:48.84 He helps set up the P.R.U. training camp
02:09:49.40 --> 02:09:54.60 But he's also important because he was a Korean war soldier. He was a forward observer in the U.S. Army
02:09:55.16 --> 02:09:57.16 So when
02:09:57.16 --> 02:10:03.80 The leadership at Seal team one is trying to you know adapt you know their naval commando force to be
02:10:03.80 --> 02:10:11.000 You know to have more you know hard army skills who do they turn to you know outside of you know their traditional
02:10:11.56 --> 02:10:18.44 Avenue for support with you know the Ranger school and things like that they turn to a former soldier guy stone guy stone sets up a
02:10:18.92 --> 02:10:20.28 curriculum
02:10:20.28 --> 02:10:22.28 It gets smart on all of his old army
02:10:23.32 --> 02:10:30.52 Manuels and he sets up training for seal team one and starts putting all the guys through it before they're going to be a nom they got to go through guys stones course
02:10:30.52 --> 02:10:32.52 So
02:10:34.12 --> 02:10:36.12 So they manage to and again
02:10:36.12 --> 02:10:42.68 I mean this song that you have so many good stories in there about what what happened what this look like who these characters were
02:10:46.20 --> 02:10:48.68 Now we move into a chapter 14
02:10:49.72 --> 02:10:57.08 The direct action seals who dodged the version then perfected a mission that propelled the teams past the river banks
02:10:57.08 --> 02:10:59.08 Into history
02:11:00.28 --> 02:11:02.28 Go into the book here
02:11:03.56 --> 02:11:12.04 In the winter of 1956 Robert T. Gallagher joined UDTR and I said that already today one time
02:11:12.04 --> 02:11:16.60 But this is what buds used to be called was UDTR which is UD universe so
02:11:17.64 --> 02:11:20.68 Unwater demolition teams replacement training
02:11:20.68 --> 02:11:27.16 So Gallagher joined UDTR class 17 at little creek a class comprised of
02:11:27.48 --> 02:11:37.96 97 personnel including five Navy officers five US Army soldier graduates from Ranger School and one black sailor from Ohio who remarkably had taught himself to swim in a creek after a town
02:11:37.96 --> 02:11:41.96 Order to integrate the local pool had prompted the owner to fill it with rocks
02:11:43.80 --> 02:11:45.80 How did you dig up that piece of information?
02:11:45.80 --> 02:11:50.76 I mean that was from Bill Goynes he was the first
02:11:51.56 --> 02:11:54.60 First black seal he'd been one of the plank owners at
02:11:55.40 --> 02:11:57.16 Seal team too and he's you know
02:11:58.20 --> 02:12:01.24 Just I mean he's he's still still alive and still
02:12:02.12 --> 02:12:06.92 Contributing he's helping with the navies recruitment efforts of of black sailors. I mean he's
02:12:07.64 --> 02:12:13.000 You know minorities he's he's an incredible person and there's not a trace of you know bitterness
02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000 I mean he's just
02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:19.64 He has every every right to be better you know for you know everything that he went through and he's just
02:12:20.68 --> 02:12:25.88 Talking to him is just it's just such a you know, it's a pleasure to talk. Let's get him on the podcast
02:12:27.80 --> 02:12:35.64 At one point in the first few weeks of the temperature had dropped solo that Gallagher and his classmates had been forced to break the ice that it
02:12:35.64 --> 02:12:40.04 Crested the edge of the chest of peak base so their instructors could torture them in it
02:12:40.04 --> 02:12:46.28 And ritual not unheard of in UDT's east coast winter classes after four weeks of this
02:12:46.76 --> 02:12:52.24 Four weeks of heaving logs over wind swept sand dunes four weeks of wet fatigue
02:12:52.36 --> 02:12:56.60 Freezing to their skin four weeks of elephant marches with boats on their head
02:12:57.32 --> 02:13:02.84 A misery that had rubbed Gallagher's thinning weed already thinning widows peak raw
02:13:02.84 --> 02:13:09.08 More than 50% of the class had quit including one of the Navy officers and all five of the Ranger school graduates
02:13:09.96 --> 02:13:16.36 It was just too psychological for them one man remembered and there had been so much farther to go
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:22.36 After a total of 16 weeks class 17 had shrunk to a mere shadow of itself
02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.24 Of the 97 who had started only 14 graduated
02:13:27.24 --> 02:13:35.24 One of those incidentally was the undontered black sailor from Ohio another of course was Gallagher
02:13:36.28 --> 02:13:40.76 Gallagher's subsequent career in the UDTs was more than commendable
02:13:41.40 --> 02:13:44.68 Whenever he went he excelled and more
02:13:45.48 --> 02:13:54.44 This reputation plus his standing as a sturdy drinker had made him a natural choice for the first batch of frogmen to join seal team too
02:13:54.44 --> 02:14:04.60 There he excelled again undertaking the most difficult assignments including a course to qualify as an explosive ordinance to disposal technician
02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:13.000 or EOD tech one of the militaries more cerebral ratings and an eight month overseas advisory billet to Istanbul
02:14:13.24 --> 02:14:17.64 Where he helped train the first all Turkish Navy UDT class
02:14:18.60 --> 02:14:23.24 From these assignments it was possible for Gallagher's peers to assemble a portrait of his personality
02:14:23.24 --> 02:14:27.24 Hard charging in intense yet entirely devoid of pretense
02:14:28.36 --> 02:14:34.76 When deployed it was only on the rare occasion he was seen in anything but a rumpled pair of UDT shorts
02:14:35.56 --> 02:14:40.52 He was above all known for his quiet confidence the oxygen of of his leadership
02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000 But with the emphasis on quiet
02:14:44.36 --> 02:14:51.88 He had all the sensitivity of a rock remembered one teammate unless at a bar the only place he seemed to allow
02:14:51.88 --> 02:14:53.88 a sense of humor to walk around off leash
02:14:54.60 --> 02:15:00.52 He was just more pulled into himself than others remember to teammate just tough to get to know
02:15:02.04 --> 02:15:06.20 For the first of it for the force of his personality first combat experience
02:15:06.68 --> 02:15:11.56 Gallagher was from the moment he joined the seventh platoon's unofficial leader
02:15:12.20 --> 02:15:16.60 No one argued with him said really Matthews about to depart on his first deployment
02:15:16.92 --> 02:15:20.12 You might win the fight, but you never want to go to sleep again
02:15:20.12 --> 02:15:22.12 The reality was actually
02:15:23.24 --> 02:15:25.24 slightly less severe
02:15:25.24 --> 02:15:29.96 Certainly Gallagher was all the aforementioned was remote intense almost humorless
02:15:30.28 --> 02:15:35.48 But there was another quality that would soon help him become one of the best combat leaders in the history of the navy
02:15:36.28 --> 02:15:39.96 Essentially an orphan from the day Gallagher had joined the seals
02:15:40.36 --> 02:15:42.68 They had been whether they knew it or not
02:15:43.24 --> 02:15:44.60 his family
02:15:44.60 --> 02:15:50.28 Nothing matters nothing mattered as much to him nothing except maybe the mission
02:15:51.08 --> 02:15:55.96 A mission whose evolution would have no greater contributor than Gallagher
02:15:59.96 --> 02:16:01.96 He's a
02:16:03.40 --> 02:16:09.64 I don't even know where to start with Gallagher. I always I say that I don't like the term hero
02:16:09.64 --> 02:16:13.40 But if I have to if you had to pick one or if you had to pick a person
02:16:13.40 --> 02:16:15.40 that you know to kind of
02:16:16.92 --> 02:16:24.44 You know set up as a as an example for young frogman. This is that he's the anti-Marsenko
02:16:25.40 --> 02:16:27.40 you know the he's the
02:16:27.96 --> 02:16:29.96 He's not
02:16:29.96 --> 02:16:31.96 boastful he's not
02:16:33.48 --> 02:16:35.000 He never never
02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.16 Never stretched the truth on anything the day ever did
02:16:37.16 --> 02:16:42.04 Partly because he just never talked about what he did
02:16:43.16 --> 02:16:45.16 I mean he
02:16:45.32 --> 02:16:49.48 I managed to talk to you know I may I interviewed a lot of people for the book
02:16:50.28 --> 02:16:53.88 And I'd always find a way to you know convince somebody to to talk to me
02:16:56.52 --> 02:17:00.12 I when I when I finally was able to track Gallagher down
02:17:01.48 --> 02:17:03.48 You know I kind of
02:17:03.48 --> 02:17:06.44 Took deep breath the hour the number
02:17:08.68 --> 02:17:10.68 He answered the phone
02:17:10.68 --> 02:17:15.24 I'm hastily rather than this is Ben Milligan. I'm writing history that I'm former seal
02:17:15.24 --> 02:17:19.08 Little I'm trying to get through like you know my introduction
02:17:20.76 --> 02:17:22.76 Tell them you know
02:17:22.76 --> 02:17:26.84 Gonna be writing about the 7-platoon would love to hear your perspective. I've talked to many of your teammates
02:17:26.84 --> 02:17:29.96 I talked to Pete Peterson. I talked to Rehmati. I talked to the you know all these guys
02:17:29.96 --> 02:17:33.24 Um would love to get your perspective if you have time
02:17:33.96 --> 02:17:35.96 He right here
02:17:36.52 --> 02:17:40.04 Takes a pause and he goes I don't think I want to do that any hangs up
02:17:42.20 --> 02:17:48.12 All the work that I had done that was that huh? That was your interview. That was it did you ever get anything out of them?
02:17:48.12 --> 02:17:51.72 Nope never did talk to everybody. I mean everyone in his orbit
02:17:53.24 --> 02:17:57.08 Learn I mean learned as much about him as I've learned about anybody he had
02:17:57.08 --> 02:18:03.48 When you were reading through that you know there was stuff that didn't make the book like when I say he's essentially an orphan
02:18:03.48 --> 02:18:04.28 I mean
02:18:04.28 --> 02:18:07.88 He's essentially an orphan and I hope that you know a reader or listener
02:18:08.44 --> 02:18:15.16 You know has this you know some sense of what that means like his childhood was nothing less than heartbreaking
02:18:15.40 --> 02:18:16.76 his father abandoned
02:18:16.76 --> 02:18:17.80 uh him
02:18:17.80 --> 02:18:21.48 No and his sister him and his brother and his sister to a
02:18:21.48 --> 02:18:29.48 And and their mother who had tuberculosis essentially to a sanatorium when the mother died
02:18:30.28 --> 02:18:31.56 Both
02:18:32.44 --> 02:18:35.96 Bob and his sister replaced into separate orphanages
02:18:36.92 --> 02:18:42.76 Bob who at the time and believe was only around four years old his sister was two and a half and they were so close
02:18:42.76 --> 02:18:45.32 inseparable that every night Bob would escape
02:18:45.32 --> 02:18:50.84 His dormitory in the orphanage sneak across this really really wide expanse of a
02:18:51.72 --> 02:18:57.88 Field between the girls dormitory sneak into the girls dorm and sneak into her bed just so she wouldn't have to sleep alone
02:18:58.44 --> 02:19:06.92 And this one he was four years old. Yeah. How did you get this information from his niece who was essentially raised like I mean
02:19:06.92 --> 02:19:10.12 Not I don't know if you she was very close to her uncle
02:19:10.12 --> 02:19:12.12 um
02:19:13.24 --> 02:19:15.24 He uh
02:19:15.88 --> 02:19:23.08 But he had he I mean it wasn't just the war that you know made him or just combat that that made him
02:19:23.08 --> 02:19:27.24 You know insular and you know shut off from everybody he was
02:19:28.44 --> 02:19:34.20 I think you know the fate's kind of contributed you know to to create that person and he was
02:19:34.20 --> 02:19:42.20 Not a broken person but he had a real hard time relating to the folks is you know he's had a you know a bad relationship with his own children
02:19:43.24 --> 02:19:44.28 His
02:19:44.28 --> 02:19:48.84 It was a strange from his wife's wife never divorced him but he was a strange drum her
02:19:50.52 --> 02:19:54.12 And he you know he had a just really you know tough time
02:19:54.12 --> 02:19:59.80 I think the only person that he was really close to and life aside from you know his teammates
02:19:59.80 --> 02:20:02.76 Aside from you know somebody like Pete Peterson
02:20:04.52 --> 02:20:06.52 What is his sister
02:20:08.28 --> 02:20:10.68 As a side note this last
02:20:11.72 --> 02:20:12.92 Muster
02:20:12.92 --> 02:20:15.96 Down at four peers they had you know because of COVID
02:20:16.68 --> 02:20:20.12 You've ever been to four peers and they do the mustard they hasn't been to the mustard
02:20:20.12 --> 02:20:23.40 But but I know about the ashes when but tell it till everyone that's awesome
02:20:23.40 --> 02:20:25.88 So they were doing an ashes when they
02:20:25.88 --> 02:20:32.20 Every year at four peers once a year they will do an ashes swim so if anyone
02:20:32.68 --> 02:20:36.60 Connected to an SW has died in the previous year and they would like their ashes to be
02:20:37.16 --> 02:20:41.16 Committed to the the ocean they will that they do a sunrise
02:20:41.80 --> 02:20:42.76 swim
02:20:42.76 --> 02:20:44.12 out into the
02:20:44.12 --> 02:20:46.12 Atlantic and
02:20:46.60 --> 02:20:52.12 To your teammates will score your ashes out into the sea and they'll release release their ashes
02:20:52.52 --> 02:20:54.52 I've never been to one of these things
02:20:54.52 --> 02:20:56.52 I've heard about them
02:20:57.40 --> 02:21:02.52 This year I was invited down to to give a talk on the history of the teams and
02:21:03.16 --> 02:21:07.000 They asked me if I would you know participate the next morning and one of these
02:21:07.88 --> 02:21:14.76 You know swims I knew Pete Peterson was gonna be there met you know I'd interview Pete a number of times for the book and
02:21:16.44 --> 02:21:21.48 I knew that he was going to be swimming bobs ashes Bob died several months before
02:21:21.48 --> 02:21:25.48 And he was going to be swimming bobs ashes
02:21:26.12 --> 02:21:30.36 In addition to bobs ashes there were two other members of the seventh platoon
02:21:31.08 --> 02:21:33.64 That were whose ashes were going to be swam out
02:21:35.88 --> 02:21:40.28 So I you know I told Pete if you need you know a swim buddy for this
02:21:40.28 --> 02:21:46.12 I'm happy to have you to join you and he was more than happy to accept so the next morning we're out there
02:21:46.76 --> 02:21:48.76 You know for a m they want to install mustard
02:21:48.76 --> 02:21:52.44 You know kind of backed by the museum away from the ocean and
02:21:53.56 --> 02:21:57.96 It's November and it's pretty cold. It's probably the high 40s and
02:21:58.68 --> 02:22:03.32 You know we're just out there and swim trunks with you know flippers and you know they're going down the roster
02:22:03.32 --> 02:22:05.72 Okay, all right here's the here's the name you know
02:22:06.68 --> 02:22:11.96 Bob Bob Gallagher swimming Bob you know Pete you know he's in his mid 80s at this point. He raises his hand
02:22:12.60 --> 02:22:14.60 You know got
02:22:14.60 --> 02:22:16.60 He's an old guy
02:22:16.60 --> 02:22:22.68 But he's a I'm just a little Bob it's like all right who's swimming with Pete like I shot my hand up so fast
02:22:22.68 --> 02:22:24.68 I'm just a little Pete
02:22:26.52 --> 02:22:31.96 But after you know your assignments, you know right you know before sunrise they march you out and I was not
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000 Expecting
02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:40.60 You know sort of the spectacle of what was out there they had a shadow box set up for
02:22:40.60 --> 02:22:49.000 Every person whose ashes were being swam out so about 40 different shadow boxes with a you know flag and then
02:22:49.56 --> 02:22:53.88 Behind that you know facing the ocean probably out 50 50 people
02:22:54.68 --> 02:22:56.68 per shadow box
02:22:56.68 --> 02:23:01.24 Of family members that were all assembled there to watch their loved ones ashes being swam out to
02:23:01.80 --> 02:23:02.76 So I'm not to see
02:23:02.76 --> 02:23:06.12 You know bagpipes at a Navy band they had a flag team
02:23:06.12 --> 02:23:10.52 It was it was a huge huge click of thousands of people on the beach
02:23:11.40 --> 02:23:13.40 They do a flag ceremony
02:23:13.40 --> 02:23:15.40 So they kind of they they
02:23:15.96 --> 02:23:20.44 Position the swimmers you know behind the shadow box facing the family
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:25.80 They go down one by one and they'll do a you know presentation to the flag to the family
02:23:26.36 --> 02:23:31.08 Now they you know set us up man, you know me and Pete behind Bob's ashes
02:23:31.56 --> 02:23:33.56 But right next to Bob's family
02:23:33.56 --> 02:23:35.56 They
02:23:35.72 --> 02:23:37.72 They had
02:23:39.96 --> 02:23:45.24 Roy Matthews who is also in the seventh platoon and they also had Ron Yaw Ron Yaw's family right there too
02:23:45.40 --> 02:23:50.44 And they were both members of the seventh platoon and I'm standing there with Pete who was you know
02:23:50.44 --> 02:23:54.60 They're OIC you know in the you know in Vietnam and you can see Pete's getting
02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.64 Pete's getting emotional here and I'm blaming my would have been to
02:23:59.16 --> 02:24:02.04 And I'm starting to think you know seeing Pete
02:24:02.04 --> 02:24:04.04 And
02:24:04.04 --> 02:24:09.40 They finally you know they have to the flag presentation they handy the ashes and they hand you know hand Bob's ashes, you know to us
02:24:10.44 --> 02:24:14.04 Bob's at least 20 pounds. I mean the the bag of ashes. It's pretty heavy
02:24:14.84 --> 02:24:20.12 From looking at you know Pete and they finally tell us you know about face start marching to the ocean we start backing up
02:24:20.84 --> 02:24:22.84 Guys are getting online, you know
02:24:23.88 --> 02:24:25.56 You know putting fins on
02:24:25.56 --> 02:24:29.24 Pete's having you know a little bit of a tough time getting those those fins on
02:24:29.24 --> 02:24:33.88 I'm starting to see the the line you know kind of edge away from us a little bit like
02:24:34.36 --> 02:24:38.84 We're starting to be like all right we're in Peter starting to get left behind here a little bit like I'm starting to wonder
02:24:39.16 --> 02:24:43.64 You know the waves are pretty big for Florida. I've never seen waves that big in Florida
02:24:43.64 --> 02:24:45.96 But we're starting to back into and I'm looking at Pete and I'm like Pete
02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.96 We're not do this man we can find somebody else to just win
02:24:50.36 --> 02:24:54.76 You know Bob out we'll take care of this if you can't do this Pete looks at me
02:24:54.76 --> 02:24:57.56 He goes like I think there's really only one thing to do here
02:24:57.56 --> 02:25:04.76 And like all right I start to grab his arm like we're gonna head back in he takes off like he dies through that way
02:25:05.48 --> 02:25:10.44 He went from being like an 83 year old man to a 25 year old frog meant like that
02:25:10.84 --> 02:25:14.20 I couldn't keep up with him. I'm doing everything I can to so I'm dragging Bob
02:25:14.76 --> 02:25:16.76 through the sir
02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:18.52 and

02:25:31.24 --> 02:25:34.04 I mean the whole whole thing
02:25:35.72 --> 02:25:39.08 That's all ten years of work on this book
02:25:40.04 --> 02:25:42.04 It was worth it in that moment
02:25:42.04 --> 02:25:52.04 Hmm
02:25:56.60 --> 02:26:01.40 But I mean you you can see it like you see it there like you see like
02:26:03.16 --> 02:26:06.28 I mean even the guys I've been talking to guys that are you know
02:26:06.28 --> 02:26:10.28 From that era
02:26:10.28 --> 02:26:14.44 Guys that her and even mentioned in the book but they are you know two a man they are
02:26:15.56 --> 02:26:21.56 You know they all express you know how pleased they are that you know Bob's
02:26:22.84 --> 02:26:26.36 Contribution you know Bob Gallagher who's you never
02:26:27.32 --> 02:26:29.32 Never you know
02:26:29.32 --> 02:26:31.32 Toud of it is on achievements
02:26:31.32 --> 02:26:34.92 I mean if anybody's going to you know
02:26:36.76 --> 02:26:40.76 Capture the you know the attention of that era I mean that should be him
02:26:41.32 --> 02:26:45.96 Is it an interesting thing about him too that I mean he like I say he's the anti-Marsinko
02:26:45.96 --> 02:26:47.80 He's he's not you know he's not a
02:26:49.40 --> 02:26:54.60 He he had such pride and the rest of the the Navy like him in a way that I you know
02:26:54.60 --> 02:26:59.72 I when I said out to write this book I always assumed that I'd be writing a book that you know confirmed all the myths about us
02:26:59.72 --> 02:27:05.08 That we did all this ourselves you know and then the Navy you know was always the you know the the branch of
02:27:05.08 --> 02:27:08.92 The the parent command that was trying to keep us you know assigned to the water
02:27:09.24 --> 02:27:13.96 When I found the opposite to be true and then when I discovered Bob Gallagher Bob Gallagher's last thing legacy
02:27:13.96 --> 02:27:19.56 If anything is you know how much pride he had not just in the seal t's but in his parent service too
02:27:19.56 --> 02:27:22.76 He left the seal t's one of the last things he did he took a
02:27:23.32 --> 02:27:24.52 Commission
02:27:24.52 --> 02:27:26.52 Which no I don't know that anybody
02:27:26.52 --> 02:27:28.52 I
02:27:28.52 --> 02:27:31.96 He took a commission as a as a warn officer
02:27:32.36 --> 02:27:37.24 I'm one of the first things he did was he or he had to leave the seal themes he had to go to an aircraft carrier and
02:27:38.84 --> 02:27:42.04 And work on this aircraft carrier with fleet sailors and
02:27:43.72 --> 02:27:46.04 Every but every seal that he ever met afterwards he
02:27:46.60 --> 02:27:52.60 To a man he told them it was one of the things he was most proud of he was able to see you know the US Navy at work
02:27:52.60 --> 02:27:59.40 And see how committed you know the is fellow shipmates and sailors were you know they weren't seals
02:27:59.96 --> 02:28:04.44 Maybe these guys couldn't you know couldn't couldn't run and couldn't do the things that frog men can do
02:28:04.68 --> 02:28:09.56 But they still had pride in their work and they still you know had a mission to do and and he was you know
02:28:09.56 --> 02:28:15.64 Everybody's proud of that as he was of his you know career in the teams when did you what stood out
02:28:17.48 --> 02:28:21.000 How did you get to that that pulled to
02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000 You know I I
02:28:24.44 --> 02:28:26.44 I spent you know
02:28:26.44 --> 02:28:31.08 a long time a long time trying to figure out where that transition had occurred
02:28:31.64 --> 02:28:33.64 You know that transition from
02:28:34.20 --> 02:28:36.04 Where the seal platoons were you know
02:28:36.76 --> 02:28:43.88 Patrol and ambushers to you know capture kill commandos and you know Marcinto he makes all these claims and his you know
02:28:43.88 --> 02:28:45.08 Rogue warrior buck
02:28:45.08 --> 02:28:48.52 That it was his platoon that was the eighth platoon that made that transition
02:28:48.52 --> 02:28:55.72 And and I went through and I I was gathering as many you know barn dance cards or after action reports as I could
02:28:56.44 --> 02:29:01.48 And you know I was going through operation by operation platoon by platoon trying to see like
02:29:01.72 --> 02:29:04.44 You know who had made that transition I went through eight platoon
02:29:04.84 --> 02:29:09.88 You know among others I was you know I was plotting insertion points extraction points actions on a objective
02:29:10.44 --> 02:29:16.20 Points for every one of their missions and you know after you know doing three months worth of Marcinto's missions I realized
02:29:16.20 --> 02:29:19.16 Every claim that he had made and Rogue warrior is bullshit
02:29:20.60 --> 02:29:25.24 Like what what she said because you know what his platoon did was totally commendable
02:29:25.24 --> 02:29:30.92 It was it was incredible like what his platoon did and their contribution to child doctor in the tetaphan's amazing
02:29:31.56 --> 02:29:35.80 But you know he was making you know outlandish claims and you know and
02:29:36.20 --> 02:29:41.48 Not only burnishing his legacy but doing it at the expense of other folks too. I couldn't understand why he was
02:29:41.48 --> 02:29:47.000 But I mean I found the seven platoon because I was just methodically going through these platoon
02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:52.76 You know platoon at a time operation by at a time and I noticed in the seven pltunes, you know this
02:29:53.16 --> 02:29:59.24 They started out like everybody else you know they they got to you know via nom and they would get a little bit of intel and they would go out
02:29:59.24 --> 02:30:01.24 They said in ambush. They'd
02:30:01.72 --> 02:30:03.72 They'd be trolled to contact
02:30:03.72 --> 02:30:04.76 But by
02:30:04.76 --> 02:30:06.52 Into the three month mark and they're deployment
02:30:06.52 --> 02:30:11.88 They're their their their operations take a noticeable turn and that's is when they meet
02:30:12.44 --> 02:30:13.80 Their interpreter
02:30:13.80 --> 02:30:18.36 Min who's a a former or who's a Vietnamese sailor and they enlist him into the organization
02:30:18.44 --> 02:30:21.80 He's not just an interpreter though. He's like a it's a source of intel
02:30:22.28 --> 02:30:24.52 Like he's he's able to connect them to
02:30:25.08 --> 02:30:29.72 You know institutions in the country that you know provide them a wealth of information and then they start going out
02:30:29.72 --> 02:30:33.32 And they they're not just going out for via calling. They're going out for via calling with names
02:30:33.32 --> 02:30:38.20 They know who they're going after so you know that the seven I'm seven pltunes makes that
02:30:39.24 --> 02:30:42.20 Makes that turn and by the end of that platoon
02:30:43.08 --> 02:30:49.48 By the by the by the summer of 1968 the platoon that that followed the the the the seven pltune
02:30:50.28 --> 02:30:54.92 They're you know they're they're doing what the seven pltune did but but better better
02:30:54.92 --> 02:30:57.80 I mean Rudy Bosch, you know rolls in with the ten pltune and
02:30:57.80 --> 02:31:05.000 Every platoon then it just it franchises at that point every platoon whether it's a seal and he's co-spotune or a west coast platoon
02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:11.96 They're all doing it. They're all you know relying on this capture kill mission and it doesn't really start to trickle off until
02:31:13.16 --> 02:31:15.16 You know the the war really starts to
02:31:16.52 --> 02:31:18.76 drive the the end of
02:31:20.36 --> 02:31:25.56 The the the funnel the the money starts to shut off, you know they stop getting you know rounds for their
02:31:25.56 --> 02:31:27.56 M16s
02:31:27.56 --> 02:31:32.76 They they don't get any more gas money for their jeeps. They take jeeps away from they make them start doing
02:31:33.16 --> 02:31:39.64 Watch standing on various bases that they're on so all the intel collection that they've been doing up to that point in the war
02:31:39.88 --> 02:31:45.56 It's starting to get you know they're not able to do it like they were and like you know 69 70 71
02:31:47.40 --> 02:31:49.40 Well first of all
02:31:49.40 --> 02:31:52.68 You want to you want to get some seals mad make them stand watch
02:31:52.68 --> 02:31:54.68 Oh
02:31:54.68 --> 02:31:58.12 I read that guys get so bad we had it we we had a
02:31:59.32 --> 02:32:03.56 To stand watch we had to stand watch on people we captured actually when my first opponent to Iraq and
02:32:05.56 --> 02:32:10.36 You would have fought like I'd say hey guys get jacked up we got a QRF to do wherever
02:32:10.36 --> 02:32:14.52 But get your gear on we're going into freaking hell guys be that cool
02:32:14.92 --> 02:32:17.16 But you say hey I know we just did that mission
02:32:17.48 --> 02:32:20.36 You got to stay at watch at five o'clock in the morning you couldn't me
02:32:20.36 --> 02:32:22.36 He's so pissed off
02:32:23.72 --> 02:32:28.28 I would take that I would take there the two o'clock in the morning to fork on me myself
02:32:28.28 --> 02:32:34.84 The N the a o i c would take the worst watch of the night the one that you had to wake up in the middle of the night, you know the other ones
02:32:34.84 --> 02:32:36.84 You kind of sleep until
02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:40.92 No, not a spot gas don't like stand watch the other thing that's interesting about this is
02:32:41.40 --> 02:32:47.24 You know having talking to having having talked to a number of sog guys
02:32:47.24 --> 02:32:51.24 Man they were so compartmentalized
02:32:52.12 --> 02:32:58.44 They would get like no turn over things would happen they would never tell anybody right and I mean
02:32:58.44 --> 02:33:00.84 I'm talking like less and learn from an operation
02:33:01.40 --> 02:33:05.48 Hey don't use this type of weapon in this situation. They'd never hear that
02:33:05.96 --> 02:33:08.52 It was well not never but it was very limited
02:33:09.16 --> 02:33:15.40 To to how much they would be able to pass on or that they would receive it was all be kind of centralized like maybe to be one guy
02:33:15.40 --> 02:33:17.40 That would debrief him
02:33:17.40 --> 02:33:22.36 So the fact that the the seals were sharing hey this is a better way to do operations here as well
02:33:22.36 --> 02:33:29.88 Who are we can make an a huge impact that's important from a leadership perspective when you're out there working in a company in a business and a team
02:33:30.36 --> 02:33:35.16 When you learn something pass it on so everyone can benefit the other thing that was like
02:33:35.56 --> 02:33:39.16 I mean totally benefit of the seals at this point is you know this
02:33:39.16 --> 02:33:44.76 Policy that the rest of the military had of individual rotation. They thought that having you know
02:33:45.88 --> 02:33:51.80 You know constant you know presence there, you know was was easier to you know keep all the equipment there
02:33:51.80 --> 02:33:57.48 But we'll just you know feed guys onesy two is easy into into a unit that's horrible. It's terrible. Yeah, they get to country
02:33:57.80 --> 02:34:03.72 Nobody knows them nobody trust them. They don't know anybody else nobody wants to train never never never work together
02:34:03.72 --> 02:34:07.96 The green berets did that lyrpest did that. I mean all of these special units the weed call special
02:34:07.96 --> 02:34:14.28 You know they are learning together as they operate all the time all the time
02:34:14.28 --> 02:34:16.12 Never end best guys are getting pulled out
02:34:16.20 --> 02:34:18.68 Whereas the seal teams they were always
02:34:19.24 --> 02:34:24.12 Deploying as a group they were coming home as a group. They were training together and they would read deploy as a group
02:34:24.12 --> 02:34:28.52 Yeah, and by the way you get turnover operation. I like this everyone shows up and now no knows what to do
02:34:28.52 --> 02:34:33.52 You get turnover operation in the spirit to be period. Yeah, so it's not like you're wait
02:34:33.52 --> 02:34:38.80 Those are kind of make sense to have new guy cyclin that way still got some experiments guys. No, it doesn't got to work together
02:34:42.64 --> 02:34:47.52 Moving on to chapter 15. And I think this might be echo's favorite title right here
02:34:51.04 --> 02:34:55.68 The Navy's skeleton key to inland combat and the final
02:34:56.56 --> 02:35:02.56 Against the current achievements in the wars abtide that exposed the seals preeminent as
02:35:02.56 --> 02:35:06.72 The US military's go anywhere commandos
02:35:08.72 --> 02:35:11.68 I've got you laughing at this bed you're editor
02:35:12.72 --> 02:35:14.72 Well, I
02:35:14.72 --> 02:35:16.72 Editors defense I'm the one that wrote the
02:35:21.92 --> 02:35:26.88 But as you said it kind of explains us, you know what's going on here a little bit
02:35:28.32 --> 02:35:30.32 Let me go to the book
02:35:30.32 --> 02:35:35.44 Within two months of his arrivals zoom wall that's the Admiral's almost strategy
02:35:35.76 --> 02:35:41.12 Zomalt strategy had pulled swift boats from the coastal blockade to take over the PBR patrols
02:35:41.76 --> 02:35:47.92 In the lower delta and had reclaimed some 90% of the vessels assigned to the mobile river reinforced
02:35:48.24 --> 02:35:57.76 To push into bloody alley of the parrots beak that portion of Cambodia that stabbed the insurgency supply lines like a knife into the delta's heart
02:35:57.76 --> 02:36:03.76 With Zomalt's arrival the seals went from being the fleets project
02:36:03.76 --> 02:36:10.24 Productile stepptile to raiders to the fleets skeleton key to inland opportunities
02:36:10.56 --> 02:36:17.28 Opportunities for navy boats navy ships navy fighters navy helicopters navy gunships
02:36:17.60 --> 02:36:20.40 Navy intelligence officers even navy seabees
02:36:21.36 --> 02:36:25.36 To goose the navy's involvement in seal operations zoom wall
02:36:25.36 --> 02:36:32.40 Always wearing forest green fatigues and occasionally accompanied by a camera and crew and reporters
02:36:32.88 --> 02:36:36.96 Routinely dropped in on his platoon and always posed a
02:36:37.28 --> 02:36:40.32 Variant of the same question how can I help?
02:36:41.68 --> 02:36:44.56 In short order that help was showing up in
02:36:45.12 --> 02:36:54.000 P. Aster's for Hoi Chans and interpreters navy jeeps to meet with sources daily grocery drops by the navy's helicopter transports
02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:00.80 After the friendly fire death of lieutenant junior grade David Nichols zoom wall took less than three days to invest in
02:37:01.52 --> 02:37:04.80 Invest one seal compound with an actual navy physician
02:37:05.84 --> 02:37:13.20 All told it was the kind of self-serving that helped infuse the seals with an even greater operational capacity
02:37:13.84 --> 02:37:20.80 So much so that within six months of zoom wall survival the headquarters of the seals task group commander in Vietnam
02:37:20.80 --> 02:37:26.96 Was finally upgraded from a cluttered desk at CTF 1116 to an entire quantum hut
02:37:28.16 --> 02:37:33.44 I need 15 more 20 more 100 more seals remembered
02:37:33.92 --> 02:37:40.000 Three war veteran frog man Frank Kane of zoom walls repeated calls to increase his complement
02:37:40.80 --> 02:37:45.84 When such request collided with the reality of seals actual manning numbers no
02:37:45.84 --> 02:37:54.16 Levels nowhere close to the green berets zoom wall even enlisted the efforts and advice of the commander of US naval forces in the Philippines
02:37:54.72 --> 02:37:56.56 none other than the bull frog himself
02:37:57.12 --> 02:37:59.12 Admiral Draper Kaufman
02:38:01.44 --> 02:38:07.68 So that's a huge turning point when you start getting this massive support from zoom wall
02:38:07.68 --> 02:38:15.04 Yeah, I mean the seals are no longer like it. They're no longer at the fringe of the navy's operations are the
02:38:17.28 --> 02:38:18.64 They're the they're the the the harpoon
02:38:20.48 --> 02:38:22.96 That you know not only is you know striking
02:38:23.60 --> 02:38:29.60 You know into the heart of the enemy but just like a harpoon at the attached to a rope it's pulling the rest of the navy inland
02:38:30.96 --> 02:38:36.40 Yeah, that that little detail that you got in there of zoom wall always wearing camis or always
02:38:36.40 --> 02:38:42.16 Where verdeges that's just like yeah, I mean it's a you're always on the lookout for whatever
02:38:42.56 --> 02:38:47.04 You know that little detail that's gonna you know it's gonna say something else to your rear
02:38:48.40 --> 02:38:50.40 I mean just just the fact that
02:38:50.56 --> 02:38:52.56 You know hit
02:38:52.88 --> 02:38:58.32 His sideburns alone like convey to the rest of his sailors that I am cool cool like you
02:38:59.20 --> 02:39:04.000 You know like I mean up to that point and you know in the navy
02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000 The
02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:12.80 There's no beards allowed. I mean when when he becomes seeing how you know what's back in you know back in fashion in the US Navy beards
02:39:13.20 --> 02:39:15.20 He brings it all back
02:39:15.20 --> 02:39:19.68 But I mean he's he's totally you know he he's like he's a I mean he has the
02:39:20.24 --> 02:39:22.24 Bonafide is to do it he's
02:39:23.44 --> 02:39:25.92 He's a junior officer all through the
02:39:26.56 --> 02:39:30.88 World War II he's one of the only sailors to to take a ship
02:39:30.88 --> 02:39:36.64 Up the Wampo River and to Shanghai he actually sees what Soko is doing at the tail of the world war two
02:39:36.64 --> 02:39:41.60 He turns over he does a prisoner exchange with with Phil Bucklew in
02:39:41.84 --> 02:39:50.24 1945 and he's seen even if he's not participated and he's gotten the glimpse of what the navy's capable of and when he gets there to Vietnam
02:39:50.24 --> 02:39:52.24 He knows the navy could be doing more
02:39:52.88 --> 02:39:54.24 And
02:39:54.24 --> 02:39:56.24 Then you know not not only
02:39:56.24 --> 02:40:03.60 Is his role as the commander of naval forces and be a nom important, but he's the one that ultimately becomes a chief of naval operations
02:40:04.16 --> 02:40:06.16 He's
02:40:06.16 --> 02:40:10.16 The seals were you know important before I mean when he becomes a CNO
02:40:10.88 --> 02:40:15.84 I mean you're vaulting the seals a preeminence now with it along with him
02:40:17.12 --> 02:40:22.08 Pretty neat the zoom wall class ships you know this Mikey monster or oh it's incredible
02:40:22.08 --> 02:40:25.60 Just I mean that that connection is yeah, that's it's so cool
02:40:29.36 --> 02:40:34.56 How about as this is you know you got but we're trying to put together like
02:40:35.52 --> 02:40:37.04 Bob Carrey's mission
02:40:37.04 --> 02:40:43.36 How hard was that it's not Bob Carrey's mission it's sort of it's sort of a one-off
02:40:44.16 --> 02:40:49.28 Like and I thought you know I thought about focusing on Bob Carrey's mission for the chapter, but it's
02:40:49.28 --> 02:40:51.28 It's it's not a
02:40:51.92 --> 02:40:57.60 It's not like an indicator of like the navy's inland adventurism because of the right on the coast
02:40:57.60 --> 02:41:02.40 It's right not trying bay what what signifies that it's
02:41:03.28 --> 02:41:05.28 important and you know like the
02:41:06.96 --> 02:41:13.92 The seals sort of like elbowing out its competitors is the fact that it's right around the corner from
02:41:14.32 --> 02:41:18.40 Where the green berets are operating like that's there that's their corner of the war
02:41:18.40 --> 02:41:22.40 So yeah, that's coastal, but it should have been in the green berets territory and here comes
02:41:22.96 --> 02:41:28.32 You know seal team one along with CTF 115 CTF 115 is the coastal squadron
02:41:29.12 --> 02:41:31.12 Or the squirt the coastal task wars
02:41:31.52 --> 02:41:37.36 They get their first seals and what do they do with them they start sending them everywhere and it is it's one of the
02:41:38.24 --> 02:41:43.92 I mean you look at that that mission and it is it's so different from what the the rest of the seal
02:41:43.92 --> 02:41:48.32 Teams are doing in the me calling Delta, but it's so indicative of
02:41:49.68 --> 02:41:53.36 You know this this transformation that the seals have gone through they're not
02:41:54.24 --> 02:41:59.28 A you know patrol and ambush force anymore now they're going after individual vehicles
02:41:59.28 --> 02:42:04.96 So they can capture them flip them and or ransack them for you know other locations
02:42:05.60 --> 02:42:10.16 So the whole mission is not a this is an entrepreneurial. This is not a you know
02:42:10.16 --> 02:42:16.72 Let's see let's see what we get they know who they're going for they've got good information and they you know they plan
02:42:17.76 --> 02:42:19.76 I really cool
02:42:19.76 --> 02:42:21.76 Special operation to go get them
02:42:23.44 --> 02:42:30.32 Did you feel tempted to get sucked into the sea wolves at all? Oh, yeah, because oh, yeah, I've had the sea
02:42:30.32 --> 02:42:35.84 I had to keep them at arms like I was like I don't have time. I was like I would find
02:42:35.84 --> 02:42:41.20 I found so I had I had a lot of documents about the sea wolves too. I was like man
02:42:42.40 --> 02:42:44.56 And there I mean navy just the
02:42:45.28 --> 02:42:50.88 Navy you know gunship squadrons alone. I mean they've gone through you know very very similar you know
02:42:53.12 --> 02:42:56.32 You know experience of let's bring them back let's just expand them
02:42:56.32 --> 02:43:02.08 Bring them back to spend again like well you and I experienced that I mean we have the the reserve squadrons that were
02:43:02.08 --> 02:43:06.96 Working pretty much as the sea wolves if they were like at the back and call of the seals
02:43:06.96 --> 02:43:10.96 You know my first deployment to Iraq it was we work with those guys all the time
02:43:10.96 --> 02:43:14.16 They were our full support and they were fantastic
02:43:14.80 --> 02:43:15.84 Fantastic
02:43:15.84 --> 02:43:18.48 But the sea wolves and mom man
02:43:18.80 --> 02:43:25.60 Commissioned in Vietnam and decommissioned the only squadron ever to be commissioned in combat and decommissioned in combat
02:43:26.16 --> 02:43:28.16 there's that one story
02:43:27.92 --> 02:43:29.92 they they
02:43:29.92 --> 02:43:34.40 They're running out of fuel. There's a platoon on the ground. They're like we're not leaving one birds like hey
02:43:34.40 --> 02:43:40.96 We're not leaving. I will just run out of gas so they they have enough gas to get in there and grab the last few guys
02:43:41.36 --> 02:43:48.24 But they don't have enough gas to make it back to base they land in the middle of a rice rice patty somewhere and they're using an ammo can to
02:43:48.88 --> 02:43:52.08 Siphon fuel into an ammo can import into the
02:43:52.96 --> 02:43:55.28 To get that thing back to base bro
02:43:55.28 --> 02:44:01.36 These guys when you talk to and the Vietnam guys that the Vietnam seals have had in the podcast like you they they just
02:44:01.92 --> 02:44:05.44 Absolutely without question love the sea wolf guys because those two will guys
02:44:06.64 --> 02:44:11.04 They took so much risk to support the seals on the ground. We know when I was
02:44:12.40 --> 02:44:14.40 There were a couple episodes when I was
02:44:14.40 --> 02:44:18.96 I would come I would see like a report of an army's like who you know
02:44:18.96 --> 02:44:23.36 It said we're not gonna land or something like that and then the report of a sea wolf pilot saying well if you don't land
02:44:23.36 --> 02:44:28.16 I'm gonna shoot you down and I was a little skeptical of that. I was like I don't know if that's that's
02:44:28.88 --> 02:44:33.84 Cricket and then I found another one. I was like wondering if this happened maybe a couple of times
02:44:35.60 --> 02:44:39.20 Maybe three into the buck. I mean not to you know every diminish what those
02:44:39.44 --> 02:44:48.24 Army slick pilots did they were I mean they were doing the lords work too, but yeah and then and then as you're trying to get like the last three years of the war
02:44:48.48 --> 02:44:51.20 Yeah, I can press that how hard was that that's tough
02:44:51.20 --> 02:44:59.28 And I had to you know I realized that I made my point. I knew that you know I had to accomplish what I said fourth the
02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:03.76 To do a established which is you know the moment when the seal became what we are today
02:45:04.32 --> 02:45:05.12 You know
02:45:05.12 --> 02:45:07.76 So now all I'm only was trying to do is just kind of
02:45:09.20 --> 02:45:10.64 one you know
02:45:10.64 --> 02:45:17.12 Further solidify you know how that had happened and you know I discovered some stuff along the way like you know the
02:45:17.12 --> 02:45:24.24 The night or the night the vision being heck of you know the night one of the the most interesting things to you know show
02:45:24.40 --> 02:45:27.60 You know how the the Navy had become you know so
02:45:28.16 --> 02:45:34.56 You know important in the Mecon Delta is you know finally the ninth the vision starts copying the seals the the lurps
02:45:35.28 --> 02:45:37.44 Start to decinflect
02:45:37.68 --> 02:45:45.92 areas and take them away from the seals and the seals you know they want to go out and you know do this raid and they can't because the army is already there
02:45:45.92 --> 02:45:52.24 And it the very good chance that if the war had continued on you know for a little bit longer
02:45:53.12 --> 02:45:58.32 That the army would have you know taken all the Navy's missions and the seals would have had to either move some place else a
02:45:58.32 --> 02:46:00.32 Dap again not sure what would have happened but
02:46:00.72 --> 02:46:06.40 Is a good chance that the army's a special operations would have gotten a lot better a lot better a lot faster
02:46:07.12 --> 02:46:11.36 But they pulled the night division out of the country altogether leaving the seal teams
02:46:11.36 --> 02:46:17.28 As the only all American command of force and the entire fourth core for two years
02:46:19.44 --> 02:46:20.80 Which I mean
02:46:20.80 --> 02:46:22.80 Talk about opportunity
02:46:23.52 --> 02:46:25.52 You know going back to the
02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000 The sea wolves and them being
02:46:29.04 --> 02:46:35.52 Answering the call you know that's a something that I learned out of the gate when I got to seal teams was that hey in
02:46:35.52 --> 02:46:44.40 Om if it was a platoon in trouble or if it was a down pilot we were going bright light no questions asked
02:46:48.24 --> 02:46:50.24 That's a
02:46:50.08 --> 02:46:56.56 That's that's an attitude that stuck through you know till this day something's going on like that we're going
02:46:57.12 --> 02:46:59.12 I mean and
02:46:59.12 --> 02:47:03.60 Whatever I don't know if it was pulled from you know the sea wolves, but
02:47:03.60 --> 02:47:09.36 I mean we we saw it carry through I mean in our time I mean the
02:47:10.80 --> 02:47:12.80 Seal team ten
02:47:12.80 --> 02:47:17.28 I mean they came to the you know rescue of a you know their STV squad
02:47:21.04 --> 02:47:22.56 The
02:47:22.56 --> 02:47:24.56 Gold squadron seals
02:47:24.56 --> 02:47:29.68 I mean they were on their way to you know come to the aid of army Rangers you know
02:47:29.68 --> 02:47:32.40 Like are they in trouble yeah
02:47:33.44 --> 02:47:36.88 As a dangerous yep you're gonna go we sure are yeah
02:47:42.16 --> 02:47:44.16 I don't know I mean it's
02:47:45.36 --> 02:47:48.72 I think Americans are in trouble and then you're gonna go oh
02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000 I mean that's
02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:55.60 You know when you start talking about Tommy Norris and his activities
02:47:55.60 --> 02:48:01.92 Yeah, I mean that's it that's exactly right like you I mean how much did Tommy risk
02:48:03.20 --> 02:48:08.64 You know to come to to rescue somebody you never know I think 11 other Americans had died
02:48:09.28 --> 02:48:13.92 Attempting to to rescue you know those those two bat either the pilot and the navigator
02:48:14.72 --> 02:48:16.24 He
02:48:16.64 --> 02:48:19.52 And not I mean he had you know he was there with
02:48:20.48 --> 02:48:22.64 His Vietnamese Rangers okay I mean
02:48:22.64 --> 02:48:28.80 Like the thing that never you know ceases to amaze me is the fact that the Seal teams
02:48:29.36 --> 02:48:34.08 Were the recipient of all of that accumulated knowledge of all that
02:48:35.20 --> 02:48:36.80 All that legacy you know
02:48:37.20 --> 02:48:40.72 Darby's legacy in the Kabanato and legacy in the point to hawk all that
02:48:41.20 --> 02:48:44.72 You know all that knowledge got compressed into the Ranger School and
02:48:45.68 --> 02:48:49.12 There are no Rangers so the Seal teams became the biggest
02:48:49.12 --> 02:48:54.40 You know collection of Ranger School graduates in the US military
02:48:55.52 --> 02:49:02.56 And then you know not only you know is there that connection with Tommy Norris you know leading Vietnamese Rangers but the
02:49:03.84 --> 02:49:08.80 The Seals and the the 7-platoon Seals during the Tetaphence of it Mito
02:49:10.32 --> 02:49:14.88 Bob Gallagher leads a squad of seals you know through the streets of Mito to
02:49:14.88 --> 02:49:22.88 To help call in airstrikes for the the stranded Vietnamese Seals or Vietnamese Rangers
02:49:24.40 --> 02:49:26.40 But yeah Bob Gallagher
02:49:26.40 --> 02:49:31.92 Tommy Norris coming you know risking everything and and he and his Rangers had undergone
02:49:32.32 --> 02:49:36.000 You know a pretty pretty terrible mortar
02:49:36.56 --> 02:49:40.96 Attack the night before he went out on that raid or went out on that rescue mission
02:49:40.96 --> 02:49:46.16 I don't I can't remember us atop my head how many of his of his Rangers were killed in that attack
02:49:46.64 --> 02:49:47.68 But I mean
02:49:47.68 --> 02:49:52.80 It would combat ineffective he only had a handful of Rangers left and him and kid you know
02:49:53.04 --> 02:49:56.96 Still decide there's an American in trouble. We're going to get him
02:49:58.24 --> 02:50:00.24 Just remarkable to me it goes out and
02:50:02.24 --> 02:50:04.24 Talking to
02:50:04.24 --> 02:50:12.88 So you asked the question how do you compress you know essentially was a three year period of history into a single you know 15 page chapter
02:50:15.36 --> 02:50:18.80 And you know you have two of you know the most
02:50:19.36 --> 02:50:24.56 You know iconic seal missions of the war that occurred during this period are not too
02:50:24.56 --> 02:50:29.84 But multiple I mean you've got you know Bob carries mission you've got Tommy Norris is mission you've got
02:50:29.84 --> 02:50:33.84 Thornton's mission to rescue Norris
02:50:33.84 --> 02:50:42.16 At some point I had the idea like I can't cover all that and it's not not necessarily it's not outside the scope of what I was doing
02:50:42.16 --> 02:50:45.44 But it's redundant to what I've already shown so I don't need to do that
02:50:45.84 --> 02:50:49.76 But I do want to cover it and some and you know pay it a nod or you know
02:50:50.96 --> 02:50:52.96 Describe it in a way that
02:50:53.12 --> 02:50:56.80 Other folks probably haven't and I had read you know the books on
02:50:56.80 --> 02:51:00.80 Tommy and Mike Thornton and I read the book on
02:51:01.68 --> 02:51:02.88 Tommy rescuing
02:51:02.88 --> 02:51:04.88 Or the most recent books on
02:51:04.88 --> 02:51:10.56 Those events and things that I noticed that they didn't cover were the metal honor ceremonies
02:51:11.36 --> 02:51:16.96 For each event I thought no wouldn't that be an interesting way to you know wrap up the book with this
02:51:16.96 --> 02:51:22.88 You know with Tommy Norris is a metal honor ceremony because Mike Thornton's metal of honor ceremony happens several years earlier
02:51:22.88 --> 02:51:26.48 Tommy doesn't happen until 1976
02:51:27.28 --> 02:51:29.68 Vietnam wars over fall of Sagan's happened
02:51:30.64 --> 02:51:37.12 You can capture all of this here the history that's happened if you you know we use that that moment as a vehicle
02:51:37.52 --> 02:51:39.52 So that's what I did I
02:51:39.52 --> 02:51:42.000 contacted Tommy Norris and he was
02:51:43.60 --> 02:51:45.60 You know I caught I
02:51:45.60 --> 02:51:48.80 I have Mark Robbins who was on that deployment
02:51:48.80 --> 02:51:52.80 Lost his eye to a machine gunner's bullet
02:51:54.08 --> 02:51:55.60 Tommy had been
02:51:55.60 --> 02:51:58.64 Tommy had helped counsel him through you know the
02:52:00.32 --> 02:52:02.32 You're losing the eye and
02:52:03.12 --> 02:52:08.32 So Mark had Tommy's phone number so I just called called him one day got him with a phone and
02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:15.04 Had a you know kind of a series of talks with him but he just couldn't have been you know
02:52:15.04 --> 02:52:17.04 So to more accessible more
02:52:18.56 --> 02:52:23.92 More friendly guy just a humble humble guy you know considering everything he's been through everything he's done and
02:52:24.56 --> 02:52:30.32 You know what was funny is he always you know he didn't minimize what he I mean
02:52:30.32 --> 02:52:35.12 He did minimize what he did but he also like was so proud of you know his post war
02:52:35.60 --> 02:52:38.24 You know career in the FBI he had this like
02:52:39.36 --> 02:52:42.96 I mean he had a I mean this in addition to his you know
02:52:42.96 --> 02:52:48.24 See okay, yeah, there's legendary FBI career he was you know he was a under cover agent
02:52:49.12 --> 02:52:53.36 He was going after international terrorists as an under cover agent and his his
02:52:54.24 --> 02:52:58.96 Cover was that of like a one-eyed arms dealer and nobody ever doubted him
02:53:00.72 --> 02:53:02.72 he was a
02:53:02.72 --> 02:53:10.72 He was you know he went after white supremacists and I Idaho he wore the best stories that I heard about him was that the
02:53:13.20 --> 02:53:15.20 He was up on a wire
02:53:15.76 --> 02:53:17.04 many had been
02:53:17.04 --> 02:53:22.80 listening to this white supremacists for a few months and he knew that this guy won
02:53:23.60 --> 02:53:28.000 Had this this big rot while that it was his pride and joy he loved this dog
02:53:28.56 --> 02:53:30.56 And he was taking him to the vet
02:53:30.56 --> 02:53:32.56 Um
02:53:32.56 --> 02:53:35.76 Not serious issue but he was going to leave the the dog there overnight
02:53:36.32 --> 02:53:41.20 So Tommy you know having listened to this guy's voice for like a month he could imitate him pretty well
02:53:41.76 --> 02:53:46.80 So the night the dog was there Tommy makes a phone call to the vet he's like hey
02:53:47.36 --> 02:53:49.36 While the dogs there why don't you go ahead and neuter him
02:53:53.60 --> 02:53:55.60 I don't know if it's true
02:53:55.60 --> 02:53:58.64 I don't know I don't know this is an accurate story with his soul
02:53:58.64 --> 02:54:02.64 I didn't get in the book because I couldn't verify
02:54:03.76 --> 02:54:08.88 The other story that I heard and this was from a Vietnam era seal who was one of the first team leaders at HRT
02:54:09.44 --> 02:54:10.96 So he would
02:54:10.96 --> 02:54:13.92 Tommy wasn't one of the founders of HRT but he was one of the
02:54:14.48 --> 02:54:18.24 Plank owners he was one of the first guys to go through the HRT selection
02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000 And so HRT was in
02:54:22.72 --> 02:54:26.88 They were conducting one of their very first operations in 1985
02:54:26.88 --> 02:54:28.88 It was against day or they were trying to
02:54:29.84 --> 02:54:31.84 apprehend a
02:54:32.80 --> 02:54:37.68 Puerto Rican nationalist to a semi it was essentially it was a terrorist
02:54:38.56 --> 02:54:45.20 But they were conducting a I believe in a restaurant and they were going up this guy the the stairs to this guy's house
02:54:45.68 --> 02:54:51.84 It leans over the balcony with a machine gun and stitches the entire assault team and shoots one operator in the eye
02:54:53.60 --> 02:54:55.60 They the the team backs out and
02:54:55.60 --> 02:55:00.48 You know Charles or Sandy Pro Proty because a silver star seal himself
02:55:02.72 --> 02:55:05.20 The team leader for for HRT
02:55:05.76 --> 02:55:09.28 He's trying to you know come up with a plan to go in and get this guy
02:55:09.76 --> 02:55:11.44 Tommy comes running up to Sandy
02:55:11.44 --> 02:55:16.72 I got a plan to get get this guy he's like all right Tommy what's the plan? How about I run upstairs and kill him?
02:55:16.72 --> 02:55:18.72 Yeah
02:55:22.48 --> 02:55:24.48 Check

02:55:27.68 --> 02:55:30.16 I don't know if we could find a better place to wrap it up than that

02:55:35.28 --> 02:55:38.48 You know we've we've been in and out of different stories

02:56:20.08 --> 02:56:22.08 I can't thank you enough. Well
02:56:24.16 --> 02:56:28.56 The amount of effort that you put in this book the product is just outstanding and I can't even have
02:56:28.56 --> 02:56:32.08 Fathom that there would be someone else that would go through the effort that you did
02:56:32.08 --> 02:56:41.60 To to do this you know you're like you got issues dude. Yeah, that's true that but so do you
02:56:42.16 --> 02:56:46.96 I think about like I'm leaving the teams as a is a dramatic event
02:56:47.60 --> 02:56:54.80 That's dramatic which you have proved look at this look at the I mean the the infrastructure that's surrounding you at this point
02:56:54.80 --> 02:56:56.80 It's a you have to do something
02:56:56.80 --> 02:57:02.16 To account for that trauma and I always used to think that I was immune to you know
02:57:02.40 --> 02:57:07.28 You know leaving leaving the teams and I was never going to you know fill it with anything else and you know
02:57:07.28 --> 02:57:12.24 I'd never gotten any tattoos. I'd never you know I didn't get into triathlons or anything like that
02:57:14.08 --> 02:57:19.44 I just had this huge blind spot creeping up on me that I didn't know about and uh
02:57:20.40 --> 02:57:22.40 Once once this thing
02:57:23.20 --> 02:57:24.40 found me
02:57:24.40 --> 02:57:26.40 I mean I was
02:57:26.40 --> 02:57:28.88 I was hostage to it like there wasn't anything I mean it was
02:57:29.44 --> 02:57:31.44 Adominated my life I mean it was
02:57:32.56 --> 02:57:36.88 You know I don't I'd try to really you know curtail the amount of time that I put into it
02:57:36.88 --> 02:57:40.08 I only work in the morning and work in the evening you know after the kids were in bed
02:57:42.08 --> 02:57:44.40 But what I found was that I would leave off
02:57:45.12 --> 02:57:51.92 Writing or researching and then throughout the day this thing would just be on a loop in my head and I couldn't break away
02:57:53.28 --> 02:57:55.28 And it was like that for 10 years
02:57:55.28 --> 02:58:00.16 When you when it got published where you already thinking about your next book. Oh, you just like
02:58:00.72 --> 02:58:06.24 You know I know I breathe there so I when I was writing the book I had kind of a I was I
02:58:06.88 --> 02:58:09.44 If I wasn't thinking about a paragraph or a specific
02:58:10.08 --> 02:58:15.04 You know issue I had this sort of mental loop going on in my head and it was always like
02:58:15.52 --> 02:58:19.92 What's the point what's the point what's the point what's the point of this book what's the point of this chapter what's the point of the sentence?
02:58:19.92 --> 02:58:26.32 What am I doing what what's the point what's the point what's the point what's the purpose and that that question is always on a loop in my head and then when I
02:58:26.80 --> 02:58:30.08 Turned the final manuscript and I was done and I
02:58:30.64 --> 02:58:34.16 Didn't have that question to think about I
02:58:35.52 --> 02:58:37.52 I was a little lost
02:58:37.52 --> 02:58:43.44 And I found myself like I took a walk in my neighborhood and I was just and all the sudden I found myself
02:58:45.84 --> 02:58:47.84 Sort of subconsciously
02:58:47.84 --> 02:58:53.44 Thinking I started to say what's next next what's next what's next?
02:58:53.44 --> 02:58:57.52 What's next yeah, just and I just I and I've fortunately
02:58:57.92 --> 02:58:59.92 Through a lot of counseling
02:59:00.64 --> 02:59:05.04 Through some distance from the book I've been able to you know take a take a pause
02:59:05.04 --> 02:59:07.44 I kind of gave myself you know mentally a year
02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000 You know from the data publication
02:59:10.88 --> 02:59:14.88 Until you know so for a year so July 20th when it came out
02:59:14.88 --> 02:59:18.96 I'm giving myself till July 20th of
02:59:18.96 --> 02:59:25.04 2022 before I really start you know buckling down or start beating myself up about what's next
02:59:25.76 --> 02:59:32.96 So I'm a psycho because we might once I get done as soon as I get done in turn the final manuscript
02:59:34.16 --> 02:59:38.000 Well first of all before that even happens I'm already plotting I already got that next book
02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:43.60 I'm of one of them is bubbled to the surface and I'm ready or rock and roll and so by the time the book comes out
02:59:43.60 --> 02:59:48.08 What I want to warm one one one of my books gets published the art other one is already
02:59:49.28 --> 02:59:56.88 It's already being formulated and kind of being written which is really annoying because I also have like the
02:59:57.28 --> 03:00:02.88 Repweet loop in my head like oh this could be got this weird and this is that angle there's no there's no moment to go
03:00:03.84 --> 03:00:05.84 No
03:00:05.84 --> 03:00:08.48 Yeah, so I mean there was maybe a
03:00:08.48 --> 03:00:14.56 Afternoon I did reward myself at the end of each chapter. I would get I would get drunk
03:00:16.88 --> 03:00:21.76 And I wouldn't go out drinking or anything like that and every day I would just I would you got done with the chapter?
03:00:21.76 --> 03:00:25.60 Would it be like that's the rough chapter or is that like hey?
03:00:25.60 --> 03:00:32.08 I mean yeah, it was the first draft. I'll give it always coming back. Yeah, yeah, but I mean just getting you know
03:00:32.40 --> 03:00:36.40 Putting that flag in the ground and being like I'm done with that chapter like I felt like you know
03:00:36.40 --> 03:00:41.60 Even if I knew that it wasn't perfect and if I knew if I was gonna have to come back at least I knew the meat was there
03:00:41.60 --> 03:00:46.16 Meat was there the content was there and the and I if I had let myself
03:00:46.56 --> 03:00:51.20 You know get that far then I knew what the point of the chapter was I knew why that chapter was important
03:00:51.20 --> 03:00:56.88 And I knew the point that I was trying to make so at least I had the you know the bones of the chapter the structure was good
03:00:57.12 --> 03:01:00.08 You know whether or not I was gonna come back and add stuff on you know the
03:01:01.60 --> 03:01:03.60 The Cuban frog men or something like that or
03:01:03.60 --> 03:01:05.60 um
03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:07.04 Gosh
03:01:07.04 --> 03:01:11.32 Where are you leaning towards your next book you must be must have an idea in that I have an idea
03:01:11.32 --> 03:01:13.32 It's very private
03:01:13.32 --> 03:01:19.46 Private all right, you know, no one's gonna steal it every idea is I is not that because no one has enough time
03:01:19.46 --> 03:01:24.000 No, I mean it has nothing to do with that is that I need I need that in my head
03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:28.88 I if I say it out loud for for whatever reason it will it'll be like I
03:01:28.88 --> 03:01:35.20 Need the motivation of it. I need the the unfinished quality of it to motor baby
03:01:35.60 --> 03:01:38.60 That's one thing I noticed is in
03:01:39.28 --> 03:01:41.28 Seal training
03:01:41.28 --> 03:01:45.60 Guys that were like saying like oh I'm in seal training. I'm in seal training. I'm in seal training
03:01:45.60 --> 03:01:49.72 Those guys didn't seem to make it. Yeah, so maybe it's the same kind of thing for you
03:01:49.72 --> 03:01:53.82 You don't want to get it out there because that's I don't it's almost like you get rewarded for it
03:01:53.82 --> 03:01:55.82 You get a little mini reward right?
03:01:55.82 --> 03:02:01.64 Oh, that sounds awesome already got paid. Yeah, not allowing yourself to get paid. That's a good move. I like it

03:14:11.70 --> 03:14:13.70 once again
03:14:13.86 --> 03:14:16.58 There are opportunities out there
03:14:17.70 --> 03:14:22.98 But they're not gonna just they're not gonna beat down your door you got to look for you got a there's a
03:14:23.22 --> 03:14:25.22 expression we used to have in the teams
03:14:25.22 --> 03:14:28.74 Look for work remember that expression look for work
03:14:28.74 --> 03:14:34.26 So when you're a new guy and you're hitting a target a training operation and you don't really know what to do
03:14:34.26 --> 03:14:39.26 So you're kind of standing there with your weapon at high port not doing anything and some freaking platoon chiefs
03:14:39.26 --> 03:14:43.94 Gonna look hey, will it look for work and that means you pick up your weapon and you go look for an angle to cover
03:14:44.94 --> 03:14:47.14 Well, that's what you that's what the seals did
03:14:47.86 --> 03:14:53.94 That's that's where we came from we came from a position where we were just out there looking for work
03:14:53.94 --> 03:14:55.94 Don't do what everyone else is doing
03:14:55.94 --> 03:15:00.50 First of all don't just stay in there and do nothing, but don't just do what someone else is doing there
03:15:00.50 --> 03:15:06.86 It's already getting done look for the angle that's not being covered look for the job that no one else wants look for the job
03:15:07.94 --> 03:15:13.66 That is harder that's more complex. That's cold and wet and miserable
03:15:13.78 --> 03:15:23.82 The job that requires more effort than anybody anything else and more than anybody else is willing to put up with that's where the opportunity is
03:15:23.82 --> 03:15:27.62 And then go and get after it
03:15:27.62 --> 03:15:52.000 Until next time this has been milligan and echo and jacco out
