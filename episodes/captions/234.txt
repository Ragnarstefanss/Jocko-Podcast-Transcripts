00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jocco podcast number 234 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000 So I was working with some echelon front clients the other day talking about leadership.
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000 And I was talking about the minimum use of force. Have you heard that phrase before?
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000 Yes, that's the half.
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000 So we talk about it from sort of a combatives, a tactical perspective, but I was talking about it from a leadership perspective.
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000 Meaning that you want to lead.
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000 You want to lead most of the time with a minimum use of force.
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000 So I want to do as little as I can to make you do what I want you to do. That's a good rule of thumb to lead with.
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000 I was also thinking and this is you might, I don't know if you're going to find this funny, you might.
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000 I was thinking about leaders being legit.
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000 Have you noticed I used the term legit?
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000 Yes, I used it more now.
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000 You've acquired it.
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000 I've acquired it, yes.
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000 And we know what it means, right?
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000 We use the term to mean like that's cool, but it's a little bit stronger, right?
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000 And it means kind of approved.
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.000 But then I was thinking about the source of that word, legitimate, because once again, I was talking about leaders being legit and actually beyond that,
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000 leaders being legitimate leaders, think about that, right?
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000 Think about the difference in your mind when you think of a legitimate leader or someone that's an illegitimate leader.
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000 There's a huge difference because when a leader is viewed as illegitimate, then they're not respected.
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:03.000 They're not listened to. If someone gets put new position, because they're the boss's favorite or because they backstab someone, right to get into that, to get that promotion,
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000 they're not going to be considered legitimate, a legitimate leader and that hurts their ability to lead.
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000 So as I was thinking about these two things, the men are a mucyphorce and legitimacy.
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:28.000 And I recognize both those thoughts in my head from the counter insurgency manual, FM3, tact 24.
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000 Now, here's a little history behind this manual.
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000 When I arrived in Ramadi, this is the manual that I read when I arrived in Ramadi.
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:48.000 So what happened was I arrived in Ramadi, I went to an intel briefing, during the intel briefing, there was this massive link diagram of all these bad guys, a bunch of them connected, how they were connected, who they were connected to.
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000 Some of the bad guys have little slat red slashes through them, maybe killed or a little green slash through them, they've been captured.
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000 But the thing is this massive link diagram didn't really look all that much different as the link diagram that I had left in Baghdad two and a half years prior.
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:18.000 So in my mind, I kind of realized, wait a second, of course, still doing the same thing and things don't really look all that different, this isn't good and well it seems like we're losing.
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000 So I don't know what necessarily thing triggered my brain to go and read the counter insurgency manual.
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:47.000 I must have seen something I used to read all these and still do, I'd read these sort of military websites and military news and those kind of things and somewhere in there, I had seen that this new, this new field manual is coming out.
00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:07.000 I've been written by General Patreus and General Matas, both of those guys need no introduction, both incredible leaders, very, very well known inside the military when I was in and now both of them are well known outside the military.
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:19.000 Reading this, so I went and googled it on the regular internet and so now this is like May, yeah, this is May of 2006.
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000 And I'm trying to remember, I don't think I saw the whole completed manual.
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:41.000 I think I saw, I think I saw chapters of it and I did a little research and it turns out that they did, they had sort of assembled the initial chapters and released them as quick as they could just to get this information out there.
00:04:41.000 --> 00:05:06.000 And when I read it, it definitely shaped the way I thought about the battle of Ramadi. It shaped the way that tasked you to bruiser could operate in the battle of Ramadi and really ended up shaping the way I think about a lot of different things about leadership and business and the teams and and life.
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:18.000 And so I actually dug around the internet and I found one of these early versions. So one of the versions that I found of this, it's it says on it FM3, tech 24.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:31.000 And it's June 2006. That's when this, this is the final draft. So I think I think the thing I read was probably just a little bit earlier, probably one of the few chapters released and also.
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:47.000 When I read that I read what I read and again, I wish I remembered it better. What I read I read the whole thing and when you see the whole manual, it's 250 pages and there's a lot of stuff that gets into stuff that wouldn't have been as pertinent to where I was and what I was doing.
00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:03.000 So I think I probably saw the first two or three chapters of this and I absolutely know for a fact, I saw the first chapter, which is what I want to dive into today. Now this is this is what made me want to dive into because it believe me.
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000 This is one of the first manuals that I wanted to cover. I said, oh, you know, I should cover the field. I should cover the counter and surgery field, man. We should go and read that.
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:34.000 Well, here's the deal. It is a huge manual, right? And a lot of it digs into the weeds and kind of gets really granular on, you know, how you do logistics inside it. So there's a lot of really deep, not deep's not the right word. There's a lot of very tactical techniques that you're going to use to make things happen inside of a counter insurgency.
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:53.000 But what I find fascinating about this is the way that it relates to absolutely everything, especially from a leadership perspective, especially from a leadership perspective, because you start thinking about things. You're thinking about the way the world is formulated.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:14.000 And if you think about it from an insurgency and that counter insurgency perspective, you start to see things much clearer. And the reason is because let's face it. If you, if you want to take a look at things, you want to say, oh, war is comparable to everything, right? Everything is comparable to war. Could, is it possible to say that?
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:30.000 Okay. Well, it's possible to say that. But if you don't include insurgency in that and counter insurgency in that, look war is not always, especially in business, especially inside inside of a business inside of a team.
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:44.000 Is it really a war when, you know, I'm trying to get some of one of my subordinate teams to do what my other subordinate team is doing? And they're giving me resistance. Is that war? Is that an all-out war? Not really.
00:07:44.000 --> 00:08:12.000 It's more like an insurgency. And what I've got to do, I can't just go to war with them. If I go to war with them, I'm going to destroy them. That's the goal of war. Insurgency means I'm going to form relationships. I'm going to bring people on board. I'm going to get rid of the people that are bad actors. Like it's a totally different, much more nuanced thing. And that's what allows you when you can put, when you can look at things through the prism of insurgency encounter insurgency, it gives you, it will give you some,
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:30.000 it will give you some visibility on how to handle situations. So it's real easy to say, we're at war with our competitor. Okay, I get that. We're at war with our competitor. We're going to go to war with our competitor. We're going to go to war with this other team.
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:59.000 But when you say, hey, we've got people inside of our own organization that don't agree with what we're doing. All of a sudden it takes on a totally different meaning. Because if you go to war with them, what do you do? You destroy them. Can you, can you effectively and perfectly destroy only the things that you want in a war? No. War means there's going to be collateral damage. Means people are going to, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, not really he thing.
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:12.000 So, but insurgency and counter insurgency is more nuanced. It takes more. You have to use a scalpel instead of using a battle axe, right? That's what you're doing.
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:27.000 And so when you start seeing things as an insurgency and acting as if you're utilizing counter insurgency procedures to try and solve that problem, it's a much more accurate way of saying, hey.
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000 Everything in life is comparable to war.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:46.000 Okay. Everything in life, compared to war, maybe, but that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is this allows you to make much better analogies like that.
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:56.000 I'm not saying there's perfect. I'm not saying everything in life is war. No. This allows you if there's a war analogy, if there's a war metaphor there, if there's things to be learned from war,
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:04.000 you have to learn from the insurgency and counter insurgency mindset. So, let's get into this.
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000 And I want to make sure that I kind of point some of this stuff out as we go through.
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:22.000 So here's the forward. This manual is designed to fill a doctrinal gap. It's been 20 years since the US Army published a manual devoted to counter insurgency operations at 25 since their Marine Corps published its last manual.
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:35.000 With our soldiers and Marines fighting insurgency in both Afghanistan and Iraq, it is thus essential that we give them a manual that provides principles and guidelines for counter insurgency operations. And they call that coin.
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000 Such guidance must be grounded in historical studies. However, it must be informed by contemporary experiences. So what's cool about this is,
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:55.000 and they reference the counter insurgency and the insurgency in Iraq in 2005, like that's how up to date this thing was. And they were trying to get this information out there as quick as they could.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000 This manual takes a general approach to coin. The Army and Marine Corps recognize that every insurgency is contextual and presents its own set of challenges. So guess what?
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:15.000 Every little disagreement that you have inside your team has its own little contextual things that are happening in its own set of challenges. So you have to be able to adapt to that.
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:25.000 You cannot fight former Saddamists and Islamic extremists the same way you would fight the Viet Kong, the Moros, which is a Philippine,
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:38.000 what's called in Surgeon Group, or the Tupamaro's, which was a year away, the application of principles and fundamentals to deal with each very considerably.
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:58.000 It goes on to say that nonetheless there's common characteristics of insurgencies. It says, a counter insurgency campaign is, as described in this manual, a mix of offense, defense, and stability operations conducted along multiple lines of operations. So that right there.
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:10.000 If you take that little thing right there into your mindset because if we just say we're going to war, what does that mean? It means optimally we're just going on offense.
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000 Maybe we say we're going to go off and put what we have to go on defense sometimes.
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000 But then stability, like what does that mean? That means you're trying to keep this whole organization together.
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:33.000 But you're not worried about this. When I'm going to total war with echoes country, not worried about stability for you. I'm worried about just destroying you. I'm going on offense.
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:43.000 And then conducted along multiple lines of operations. So that means there's all kind. It's not just fighting. It's not just guns.
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:57.000 It requires soldiers Marines to deploy a mix of both familiar combat tasks and skills more often associated with non military agencies with balance between them depending on the local situation. This is not easy. Leaders at all levels must adjust their approach constantly.
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:07.000 Ensuring that their elements are ready each day to be greeted with a handshake or a hand grenade.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000 What is that duty or mentality? I mean, just think you're going into a meeting. You got to be ready to deal with a handshake or a hand grenade.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000 That's what you got to be ready for.
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:32.000 To take on missions that only infrequently practiced until recent years at our combat training centers to be our nation builders as well as warriors to help reestablish institutions and local security forces to assist in rebuilding infrastructure and basic services.
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:42.000 And if facilitate the establishment of local governance in rule of law, that's what you throw the military into all that stuff. That's why counterinsurgency is so hard.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:55.000 Yeah, just everything I just said going awards like the easy part. Here's the bad guys go kill them. That's the easy part. Everything else I just said that's what makes it so complicated.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:09.000 Collecting a successful counterinsurgency campaign thus requires a flexible adaptive force led by agile, well-informed culturally astute leaders.
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000 Probably the opposite of what the stereotypical military person is.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000 His our hope that this manual provides a necessary guidelines to succeed in such a campaign.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:26.000 In operations that inevitably are exceedingly difficult and complex. Our soldiers and Marines deserve nothing less and it's signed David H. Patreus.
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000 Lieutenant General, US Army and James Anne Matas, Lieutenant General, United States Marine Corps.
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000 So there's your introduction. Right out of the gate, you can see what dealing with something totally different.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000 Just infinitely more complex.
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000 Chapter one and this is the only chapter we're going to cover today.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000 And it may be the look like I said it gets into some very granular stuff, but this is such a good opening.
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000 Chapter one, insurgency and counterinsurgency, counterinsurgency is not just thinking man's warfare. It's the graduate level of war.
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:13.000 Special forces officer in Iraq 2005. And this is what's really cool about this is
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000 the battle of Ramadi is seen as a model of counterinsurgency.
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:35.000 And I was lucky enough to be there and lucky enough to sit in brigade operators and division operators and to sit with the brigade commander and listen to what his thoughts were and hear what the input was and hear.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000 I mean, it just was I was so lucky to be a part of this.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:47.000 To be there. So, starts off overview, insurgency and counterinsurgency are subsets of war.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:05.000 The globalization and technology and technological advancement have influenced contemporary conflict in nature of war in the 21st century is the same as it has been since ancient times of violent clash of interest between or among organized groups characterized by use of military force.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:18.000 Success in war still depends on a group's ability to mobilize support for its political interests and generate sufficient violence to achieve political consequences.
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000 Means to achieve these goals are not limited to regular armies employed by a nation state at its core.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:45.000 War is a violent struggle between hostile independent and irreconcilable wills attempting to impose their desires on another. It is a complex interaction between human beings and is played out in a continuous process of action, reaction and adaptation.
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:59.000 War. This manual is available for free on the interwebs Google it. I'm not going to read the whole thing today. I'm going to hit some highlights.
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:09.000 Says this also, it's scale and complexity should never this time. Counterinsurgency. It's scale and complexity should never be underestimated by leaders and planners indeed.
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:19.000 The possible scale and complexity must be understood before the beginning of any such operation. This is a mistake we've seemed to make over and over again.
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:34.000 You think you're the big badass American military. We're going there. We're going to squash these these enemy soldiers and the peasants will be on board. You know the local populace will be on board when they see the freedom.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:45.000 And we just underestimate this thing all day long. You underestimate how hard it is to do this. How hard it is to actually execute a counterinsurgency.
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:56.000 Talks about a couple different aspects of insurgency, a couple of some kinds. A revolution, which they describe as an unplanned spontaneous explosion of popular will.
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:09.000 Another one is a coup d'état, which is a small group of plotters that replace state leaders with little support from the people at large. And an in insurgency is an organized protracted.
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000 Political military struggle designed to weaken government control.
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.000 Insurgency is normally seek to either overthrow existing social order and relocate power within the country.
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:31.000 Talks about internal wars as the name internal wars implies these are primarily conflicts within states, not conflicts between states.
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:39.000 And they all contain at least some element of civil war. That's why I think so much of this is pertinent to being a leader.
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:47.000 Because so much of being a leader isn't about how you're taking the fight to the enemy. It's how you're handling the people inside your own country.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:57.000 That's what's hard. Handling the people inside your own company, handling the people inside your own organization. Let me tell you something.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000 Adational on front. Where we do leadership consulting.
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:19.000 We spend at least as much time helping solve the problems inside the company as we do helping companies figure out how to solve what they do to beat their competitors.
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:29.000 Because if you don't have a squared away organized situation inside your team, you're not going to beat the competitors. You're not going to defeat your enemy.
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:38.000 So this counter insurgency, these counter insurgents tactics are what you use to help your own team stay unified.
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000 And if you don't utilize them correctly, guess what you get? You get an insurgency.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000 And at worst, it rips your team apart.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:58.000 But even if it doesn't rip your team apart, it has you rowing in different directions. And when you row in different directions, you don't go or you're supposed to go.
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000 So you need to keep a check on that.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:13.000 One possible exception to this rule involves what can be termed a liberation insurgency where indigents elements seek to expel or overthrow what they perceive to be a foreign occupational government.
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:22.000 Such a resistance movement could be mounted by a legitimate government in exile as well as elements competing for that role.
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000 Another thing that happens in business businesses get bought, business get bought by bigger businesses businesses have people get inside and take over.
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:36.000 There's hostile figures. There's all these kind of situations. And then you get these little insurgency inside companies inside businesses inside teams.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000 Also, we can be outside actors getting involved.
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:55.000 Fast forward in all cases, the long term objective for all side remains acceptance of the legitimacy of one side's claim to political power by the people state of region.
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:07.000 So if you're a leader and you are in a company and you're not considered legitimate, you're basically out of the gate, you're probably going to be dealing with insurgency.
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000 That's just how it's happening.
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:28.000 It's going to be rough. Another little section here. The scale and complexity of coin should never be underestimated. The effort requires a firm political will and extreme patients on the part of the government. It's people and countries providing its support.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:40.000 Why it's bed security requirements also limit flexibility again, seating to seating the initiative to insurgency. There's all kinds of reasons that the insurgency haven't advantage.
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:50.000 Right. Another quote here. The contest of the internal war is not fair as most of the rules favor the insurgence.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:00.000 Most of the rules favor the insurgence. I racked the absolutely did do do the insurgence and I racked care if they wounded friendly civilians not one bit.
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000 Did they care if they killed each other not one bit did they use torture absolutely did they use terror absolutely.
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:16.000 Did they do the most brutal and savage things to the local populace? Yes, they absolutely did and they didn't care at all.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000 So they have a completed advantage when it comes to the rules.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:31.000 Any whether you're talking about the tactical rules or the actual rules of engagement or the law of our own conflict. They don't care about any of that.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:43.000 The insurgent can make exorbitant promises and point out governmental shortcomings caused by the insurgency. So yeah, so you make a mistake fighting an insurgency. They're going to use it to their advantage.
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:55.000 You kill civilians by accident. Oh, that's going to be a you know national news world news global news. They're going to take advantage of that. They want that to happen.
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:06.000 Fast forward coin is not an approach to war that can be classified simply as foreign internal defense. It features a full spectrum of operations including stability operations like any other campaign.
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:16.000 And all cases, however, insurgencies will not be defeated simply by killing insurgencies since the insurgencies since the insurgencies begins with strategic initiative.
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000 Meaning they have an advantage.
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000 The counter insurgen is usually involved.
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:31.000 Initially and more defensive than offensive operations. That's the way it kind of kicks off. They're attacking you. You didn't even know who they are.
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:40.000 Victory cannot be gained until the people accept the legitimacy of the government mounting coin and stop actively and possibly supporting the insurgencies.
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.000 That right there, I was smiling when I read this because that's one of the quotes that I just completely ripped off from this when I read it for the first time and I started using that all the time.
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:58.000 You know, I started saying, well, you know, when my boss would ask me, you know, what are you guys trying to get done? I'm so sorry, you know, we're trying to stop the passive support.
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:22.000 That's happening for the insurgencies and all of us a nice-ounded smart stole stole stole words from them because that's what there was a lot of in Romadi. In Romadi there was local populace was so scared that if an insurgen came into their house and wanted to use their window to shoot their sniper rifle from, they would just like get out of their way, get them some bread.
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:34.000 You know, we don't want to bother you. You do what you got to do. We're not here to cause you, but they provided passive support. And that happens inside companies too. You know, you get the whatever that one element that used to be here that's going to help you.
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.000 They're going to give you a hand. They're not definitely not going to rat you out because they see that illegitimate leader that whatever stepped in.
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:52.000 I do, just want to keep their job a lot of time. Yeah, exactly. They don't want to make any waves, right?
00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:02.000 This gives a good section that kind of talks about the histories of insurgencies. That's why it's worth pulling out this book.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:14.000 Each insurgency is unique, although there may be similarities among them. In all cases, the insurgency aim is to force political change.
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000 And this is important. I've just kind of read my note here.
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:37.000 Force political change, but actually sometimes, especially in business, the goal is to prevent change, right? They don't want some new system. They don't want some new procedure. So they have a little insurgency to fight against their fighting against change.
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:50.000 Specific types of insurgency. Here's some things that you're supposed to try and figure out. What's the root cause of the insurgency? How important is that, right? If you're an a team and you're in a business, you're in a leadership position.
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000 And there's some kind of an insurgency happening. You feel that.
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:03.000 Find out what the root of it is. Where is this coming from? Next, extend to which it enjoys support both internally and externally. Who's who's on board with us?
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000 Basis on which insurgency appeal to target population.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:21.000 Insurgency motivation and depth of commitment where they are, like how much does this mean to them, likely in search of weapons and tactics, operational environment, which insurgency to initiate and develop their campaign.
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:30.000 So there's some things to look at. And this is why this, again, this is why I think this is important because
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:39.000 if you just look at your own team and you just think, oh, there against me, I'll met war with them. It's a problem. The way you fight that war is not going to be correct.
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:54.000 If you look at it as an insurgency, you say, okay, how do I actually assess this? And this becomes this gives you such a strategic advantage.
00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:03.000 Several different types of insurgency. Some of them seek to completely change the existing political system and our guests.
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000 The gallitarians, traditionalists, pluralists, they got good little definitions for all these in there.
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:16.000 Some do not seek total political power in a state. These are secessionists, reformist, preventionists, commercialists.
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000 And you've got to try to figure out what it is that your insurgency are seeking.
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000 Insurgen strategies you've got conspiratorial.
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000 Conspiratorial strategy involves a few leaders and a militant cadre or activist party,
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:43.000 seizing control of government structures or exploiting a revolutionary situation.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000 This is what's interesting. Such insurgency remains secretive as long as possible,
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000 emerging only when success can be quickly achieved.
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000 That's definitely something to think about.
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000 Because you think everything's going cool, right? You hear a little bit of murmur here, a murmur there.
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000 Someone's talking about this method that we're using, someone's against some way,
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000 some change that we want to make, hear little whispers.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000 And then all of a sudden one day boom, you get hit in the face with it.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000 And you aren't ready for it.
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000 So you've got to watch out for that.
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:29.000 Military focus, these are ones that are going to use military force to try and make things happen.
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:37.000 Urban organizations like the Irish Republican Army and Latin American groups have pursued an urban warfare strategy.
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000 Approaches as terrorist tactics and cities to so-disorder and create government repression.
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.000 Those objectives have not generated much success without wider rural support.
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000 You also got the protracted popular war.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000 God, that's an ugly term protracted war.
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000 What does that mean? It's going to last a long time.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000 And what sucks is from a psychological standpoint, like if you and I are going to train you,
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000 you're going to train you, you know that I'm just a guy that's just going to go protract it.
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000 Like you don't want none of that, right?
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000 I tend not to.
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000 Hey, well, let me, let me, let's say you set up the clock, the timer,
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000 and you put five minute rounds on there.
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000 And then I walk over and I just turn it off.
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000 There's no time limit.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000 It's just going to be a protracted war.
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000 It's where going.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000 I don't care how long it takes.
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000 I was thinking of doing it.
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000 Is there still, is there a digital tournament right now?
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000 That's no time limit.
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000 It's a mission only.
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000 Does one exist right now?
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000 I don't know.
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000 We've had some variations of it attempted.
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.000 Yeah.
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000 But is there anyone that's doing no time limit?
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000 No.
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000 It's a mission only.
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000 I think there's certain ones that have like those types of matches,
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000 but they're I think they're specific, like special matches.
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000 Like no time limit matches or something like that.
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000 It's not all of them, but it's actually pretty rare, but yes, I've seen that.
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000 What if we do a GJT tournament called protracted war?
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000 Yeah.
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000 Sure.
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000 The thing is, you got to be ready.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000 You got to be ready for it.
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000 Think about this as a competitor.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000 You're like, I got a hydrate because I might be fighting for the next nine hours.
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000 Well, that's what the UFC was.
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000 Yeah.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:28.000 Yeah.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000 The first ones were, how many before they made the time limits?
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000 15 minute time limit with like over time.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000 So it was one and two, I think.
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000 Yeah.
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000 And three?
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000 Something like that.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000 So you'd have to do this.
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000 I had an idea.
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000 You do because you got to figure most matches aren't going to last like nine hours.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000 Yeah.
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000 Very few matches would last nine hours.
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000 I think I think very few matches would go over an hour,
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000 but occasionally you would get to just really evenly matched humans.
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000 And you know how hard it is to submit somebody.
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000 That's good.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000 But if you had three mats running at the same time,
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000 and they were all had no time limit protracted war on each one of them.
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000 So that way, if you have an audience that wants to see this,
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000 they can watch whichever one is this happening.
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000 Because that's face it.
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000 And then the problem is going to get, you know, the guy's going to get a position.
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000 And he's just going to start grinding somebody down, but it might take two hours.
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000 I mean, if I got, if I was going against you in this tournament,
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000 and I got across side, it would be a long time.
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000 Yeah.
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000 I would be there for a long time.
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000 Yeah.
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000 I wouldn't rush it.
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000 I would cook you for a while.
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000 Sure.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000 Yeah.
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000 Why would I rush?
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000 Yeah, no reason.
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000 And I think that was the whole thing about Gigi to begin with, like, I'll help, you know,
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000 Haley Gracie's, you know, smaller guy, you know, and he lets that, you know,
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000 he can put himself in safe position, positioning tape, minimize damage, all this stuff,
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000 and then like, I get's all tired, and then he can use his, you know, leverage or whatever.
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000 Like, there was a lot of them.
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000 His matches old school, over one hour.
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000 Yeah.
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000 When they had no time limit.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000 But you got to be ready for that.
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000 Yeah, as a competitor, but as far as tournaments go, as an audience member.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000 Two, you got to be ready for that.
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000 Yeah.
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000 Well, that's why maybe you're doing it with multiple matches going on at the same time.
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000 And that way you can, you know, you can kind of highlight the big, the match where there's action happening.
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000 But I watched a, I don't, I don't think it was no time limit, but limit, but it was one of those ones.
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000 I think it was like a 30 minute time limit.
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000 It was like a super fight.
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000 And one of the early tournaments that I did, and they were super good.
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000 They're both really good.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000 So they're even.
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000 And like, not a won't even score to point.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000 And after a while, I was like, brother, this is, I liked Gigi to a lot.
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000 But it's got a boring.
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000 Yeah, that's, that's the, you know, what the problem is there?
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000 The time limit.
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000 The time limit.
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000 Because when you have a time limit, you're like, oh, well, I was training yesterday.
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000 I was like, hmm.
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000 There was something like 40 seconds left.
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000 I could see it on the clock.
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000 And I was fighting, I was rolling with Andy.
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000 And I was like fighting to keep him in, you know, from passing my guard.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000 And then, you know, there was like 32 seconds left.
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000 And I was like, hey, man, even if he passed my guard right now,
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000 you know, he's, chances are he's not going to finish me.
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000 So, so I'm not saying I let him pass because he definitely passed it.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000 But, yeah, you don't kind of, you know, I kind of like,
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000 within a lot, lock my hands and I kind of sat there and I'm like, you know,
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000 and even he knows it.
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000 Yeah, he knows it.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000 He's laughing.
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000 He's like smiling or whatever.
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000 He's like, yeah.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000 So that's in your head.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000 Yeah.
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000 So when you, when you're in these things, do you have a time limit?
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000 You're like, whatever.
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000 I can, I can hang out for another seven minutes.
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000 Yeah.
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000 Not just don't expose anything.
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000 But if there's no time limit,
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000 that's different mentality.
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000 So when you're going into those protracted wars,
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000 if you're the, if you're the insurgent,
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000 bro, you live there.
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000 Yeah.
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000 You live there.
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000 Your life, no.
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000 So, so you don't care how long.
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000 You know, when we, when we fought Vietnam, when we fought in Vietnam,
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000 the Vietnamese, they're not going anywhere.
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000 They're not, they're at home.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000 Right.
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000 You know, we have to go over there.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000 When we're fighting in Iraq, they're at home.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000 The insurgents are there.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000 They live there.
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000 There was foreign fighters, of course.
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000 But Afghanistan, same thing.
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000 So they have this weapon on their side,
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000 which is time, the protracted war.
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000 Yeah.
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000 This is going to some kind of off,
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000 but I was watching this.
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000 It was like, it wasn't a documentary,
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000 but you know, the kind of words like on like discovery,
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000 or one of these, and then they,
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000 they propose like, what if this happened?
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000 How, you know, like there's a show called What If Humans Disappeared,
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000 or something like that.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000 You ever heard of that?
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000 Where it's like, okay, after, you know,
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000 10 years, the cities would start to get bigger and after.
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000 And they have the CGI and it's pretty cool.
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000 So there was one where it said,
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000 it said, what if aliens took over?
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000 Mm.
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000 And how would we beat them?
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000 Because if aliens took over,
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000 they would, that's what they would be.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000 They wouldn't be like, oh,
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000 let me just come and live with you guys.
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000 That's what they're saying.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000 Chances are,
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000 Chances are they're not benevolent.
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000 Yeah, not to help people.
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000 They're here for earth, you know?
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000 It's kind of like, I mean, think about it.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000 That's a every living thing.
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000 It's kind of like, but I live here now.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000 Kind of thing.
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000 We got to,
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000 so anyway, they're saying,
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000 they're saying how would we fight the aliens?
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000 And they're, they're breaking it down.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000 Like, this is what the aliens would do first.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000 This is what they do second.
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000 This is what they do third.
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000 They're just totally breaking it out.
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000 I was like, thank.
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000 But they're saying at the end of the, at the end of the day,
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000 the best way we could win is through.
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000 I think they call it guerrilla warfare or maybe.
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000 That's what they're in certain circumstances.
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000 I forget what they called it.
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000 But that's what they would say.
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000 It's like, we live here.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000 So we have that advantage of like,
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000 we can hide for, you know, months.
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000 And then attacking, then go hide again.
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000 You know, because we live here.
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000 Meanwhile, they're here.
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000 So it's like, they're here.
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000 They got to run supplies from their own.
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000 Yeah.
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000 Whatever alien spaceship.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000 Yeah.
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000 And they got to make moves.
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000 And they got to drag me into a protracted conversation about alien evasions.
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000 I'm losing this wall over here.
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000 But it's the exact metaphor, though,
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000 you know, like where if like aliens are coming over,
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000 whether it be to take over or to get some alien job done.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000 But we live here.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000 We don't, you know, we can take hits.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000 We're still living here.
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000 This is the thing that's ridiculous about this argument.
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000 Is what level of competence does the alien do the aliens have?
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000 We'll say varying levels of competence.
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000 Okay.
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000 So if they're, let's face it,
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000 we can get invaded by aliens that were not that advanced.
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000 And we would just kick their ass real quick.
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000 Like on the district, you know, something like that?
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000 I don't know.
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000 But I don't, I'm not familiar.
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000 When we're to that battle take place.
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000 South Africa.
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000 What was, who, who are the insurgents?
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000 Aliens.
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000 Oh, no, the insurgents were, I guess that's not really an insurgent situation.
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000 Yes, sir.
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.000 Okay.
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000 I thought you were talking about an actual one time situation that I was unaware of.
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.000 Oh, yeah.
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000 The aliens came down.
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.000 Yeah.
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000 I don't know.
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000 But, um, yeah.
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000 And that movie.
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.000 Yeah.
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000 I guess, you know, a district name was not about any kind of insurgents yet.
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000 Oh.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000 It was more of that show.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000 What was their competence?
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000 What was their competence?
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000 The alien?
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.000 Yeah.
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000 Basically, it was like aliens.
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000 I don't know.
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000 I forget why they were there.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000 No one really knew why they were there.
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000 But it's essentially the ship didn't,
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000 it didn't crash, but it sort of got jammed up.
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000 And they were sort of stuck there.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:35.000 Okay.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000 So they would, they fight after a few months or a month or whatever.
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000 They, they were, the humans people went up and with their helicopters.
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000 Because the alien ship kind of came, didn't crash just hovered.
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000 And the state, they didn't open, didn't nothing.
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000 So they go up and they explore, they open the alien craft.
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000 It's pretty good, good show.
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000 Anyway, they open it and all the aliens are all starving and
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000 freaking, you know, they're messed up.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000 Like they're desolate, you know?
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000 God.
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000 And so they're like, hey, well, they're not hostile.
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000 So what do we do?
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000 Just leave it, you know, so they set up these caps form,
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000 you know, they've helped help them or whatever.
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000 So the aliens were kind of quarantined.
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000 They were both kind of tank of food.
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000 Like a food.
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000 So they kind of shuffle supplies, but rather sort of aliens, you know?
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000 Like, I don't know what do you do.
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000 You can't just let them live with us because they're kind of whatever.
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000 So it's kind of that situation.
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000 So it was less about fighting or it was less about that.
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000 It was more about some other issue.
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000 Yeah, and I guess you'd have to figure that if an alien element
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000 made it here, they're pretty advanced.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000 They got some technology.
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000 So I don't think we're going to be coming up against the JV team.
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000 No.
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000 But that's what that show was saying.
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000 The JV team isn't going to show up on Earth.
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000 No.
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000 Right?
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000 Because how do they get here?
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000 They designed some kind of a spaceship.
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000 Yeah.
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000 Got here.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000 These are some, these are some Elon Musk level smart.
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000 Well, then again, technically, sure,
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000 but that does that indicate or does that prove that
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000 they're going to be squared away in all ways.
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000 You know, maybe they just have this new technology.
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000 They can do this stuff, but if you can make a spaceship that can get here,
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000 I mean, you had to fight to get here.
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000 This was not easy.
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000 Yeah, but that's a different kind of fight when you think about it.
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000 It's insane.
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000 It's kind of like, you know, oh, maybe they're just people that
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000 imagine if they just didn't even have the concept of violence, right?
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000 Yeah, just was torn.
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000 Yeah.
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000 And so they could show up here.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000 And the first one that tries to do something,
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000 somebody just hits him and they have with a bat.
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000 And they're just all shocked.
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000 Yeah, I'll confuse them.
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000 Yeah.
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000 But is that even possible that there's a group that just has no comprehension of violence?
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000 If there is, you know what they'd be, they'd be aliens.
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000 Because, you know, same things work different.
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000 You know, like, everyone's in a lot of like,
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000 you'll get a situation where, I don't know.
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000 This turned into grounded violence or crap.
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000 I'm thinking of something real like ambiguous actually right now.
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000 But let's say, okay, let's say you're in the alien.
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000 You go to a distant planet.
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000 You're like, we're going to take over.
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000 So we're going to, we're going to bring this poison.
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000 This poison is like the most lethal poison ever created here.
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000 So we're going to take this and we're just going to exterminate them all.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000 Like that's how.
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000 So we're going to go and then you go to this distant galaxy.
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000 You go to their planet.
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000 Whatever.
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000 Perfect.
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.000 Perfect.
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000 Just like earth.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000 And you go, you start spraying this poison and they're licking it up.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.000 Yeah, they're like, oh my gosh, it solves like a bunch of their problems and make some super, you know, it's like that kind of situation.
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000 I'm just saying, it doesn't prove that just because they know how to travel through dimensions or what and it doesn't mean they're going to be successful in everything.
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000 You seem to be, you could be the opposite.
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000 Right on.
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000 All right.
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000 Well,
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000 protracted war.
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000 That's where we were at.
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000 Yes, sir.
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:55.000 Mao's theory of protracted war outlines three-faced political military approach strategic defensive.
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000 This is where the enemy.
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000 And in this case, your flip flop and back and forth and who's the enemy.
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000 But the enemy, meaning the government has stronger forces.
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000 So you're in defense.
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000 Then stalemate where you're doing gorilla operations.
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000 And then offensive is when you actually have.
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000 Be down the government forces enough that you can actually have a real war with them.
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000 Almost like a conventional war.
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000 And then it talks about how you can go.
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000 These stages you can go.
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000 You can go through one stage.
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000 You can skip a stage.
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000 You can come back to the stage.
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000 So that's what happens.
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000 Reproduct or war.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000 It's very hard to.
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000 Speaking of protracted war.
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000 It's very hard to get this submission on the insurgents because.
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000 Every time you get them get him in a chokehold, they slip out and they slip away.
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000 Right.
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000 And now you can't go and find them because they slip back in with the local populace.
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000 So you've got to kind of.
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000 You know, check for that.
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000 So that's protracted popular war.
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000 They got traditional many contemporary insurgents.
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000 These fit a more traditional approach based on clan tribe or ethnic group.
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000 Such insurgents typically has an entire community.
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000 Join the effort as a whole.
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000 Bring it with them.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000 They're existing.
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000 A social and military hierarchy.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:23.000 The primary struggle in an internal war is to mobilize people in a battle for legitimacy.
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000 And I think that word legitimacy and legit is one thing that made me start thinking,
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000 maybe I should do the counter-researchs, you may know.
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000 Because think about how often that happens in an organization.
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000 The leader is either legitimate or not.
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000 And if you're not considered a legitimate everything is hard.
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000 And if people think you're legitimate, everything is that much easier.
00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:00.000 So when you are acting as a leader and you do things that negate or detract from your legitimacy,
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000 you're doing a whole lot more damage than you think you are.
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000 Every time you use your authority in a abusive way,
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000 your legitimacy goes down.
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000 Every time you tell a lie, your legitimacy goes down.
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000 Every time you do the right thing your legitimacy goes up.
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000 Yeah.
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:27.000 I feel like you know when people will say, I demand respect.
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000 You know like that thing.
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000 You automatically just lost respect.
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000 Yeah, kind of right?
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000 Yeah.
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000 It's because that it's not really.
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000 And by the way, you don't even have to say that. You could just act like that.
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000 Just act like you demand respect.
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000 Yeah, like call me surr, damn it.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000 Kind of thing.
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000 I'm not saying there's anything wrong calling someone surr or whatever.
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000 But you know that kind of stuff.
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000 They'll harp on that kind of stuff.
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000 Like you can tell someone's reaction when they're reacting to this detail,
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000 where it's like, oh, bad, you're like, I see what you're doing.
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000 I know.
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000 It's you're basically saying like, I demand respect.
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000 I'm not going to, I mean, me earning it.
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000 That's all whole different thing.
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000 You know, so you're saying, but you just better give it to me kind of thing.
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000 So it's like one of those, you know, if you're illegitimate, that tends to be like what it looks like.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000 If you're legitimate, it tends to not be what it looks like.
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000 It's just a good little framework to think and to filter your actions through.
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000 Does this make me more or less legitimate?
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000 Mobilization means there are five means to mobilize popular support.
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000 Part persuasion, coercion, reaction to abuses foreign support, apolitical motivations.
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000 A mixture of them may motivate anyone.
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000 Individuals. So persuasion.
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000 Political Social Security and economic benefits entice people to support one side of the other.
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000 This is where you're like, hey, we're going to take care of you.
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000 Coversion.
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000 This is the carrot in the stick, right?
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000 Coversion is the carrot. Coversion is the stick. You either get on board with what we're doing or we're going to give you a beat down.
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000 Reaction to abuses. This one is important. A government that abuses its people or is is tyrannical.
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000 Generates resistance to its rule. Think about that from a leadership perspective.
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000 Think about all those three things from a leadership perspective.
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000 You can either use persuasion. You can use code.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000 So carrot, stick and then reaction to abuses.
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000 So if you're abuses, if you abuse people as a leader,
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000 they're going to have been injured, maltreated, victimized dishonor,
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000 or had close friends relative killed by the government,
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000 particularly by security forces, may lash back at their attackers.
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000 So when you're abusive to people, it's going to come back at you.
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000 It adds fuel to the insurgency.
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000 So you're saying the insurgency will use that?
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000 Oh, yeah.
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000 That's the media.
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000 That's how you get people to come on board.
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000 If I show you your house now, it's like, hey, echo.
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000 I was really sorry to hear about your brother.
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000 I can't believe that they did that.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000 Yeah.
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000 I can't believe the government security forces did that to your brother.
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000 Do you want to fight back?
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000 Yeah.
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000 Here's what we're doing.
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000 You see what I'm going on there?
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000 So that means that when you're fighting an insurgency,
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000 you can't add fuel to that fire.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000 You have to be very careful in how you act towards the populace
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:27.000 the populace because the populace, because the insurgence will utilize your abusive actions
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000 to bolster their cause.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:42.000 Foreign support, obviously, you can have people on the outside that like to see that want to support some insurgency inside of a country.
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000 A political motivations.
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:56.000 Here's criminals, mercenaries, people attracted by the holy warriors romantic status and others who self-images of being a warrior and a fighter for a cause might also join in search.
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:03.000 I think you saw a lot of that nicest people that were just criminals and just wanted to go get crime on.
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000 Yeah.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.000 I mean, it wasn't like they were promised in a whole bunch of nice stuff in the Islamic state.
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000 Yeah.
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.000 Other than authorized rape of women, children, girls and boys.
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000 There was, you know, I'm not going to say how I saw this, but I saw some ISIS promo videos.
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000 Like promo, like, yeah.
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000 I don't know that they were recruiting videos.
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000 Oh, no, there's some of those too.
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000 But it was like a promo, like advertisement for this cool, like club kind of thing.
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000 Yeah.
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000 Oh, wait, were they ones that were like insanely violent?
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000 No.
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000 So they were just kind of real positive.
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000 Yeah.
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000 And it would show like, yeah, there was a whole bunch of them.
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000 And yes, they're the insanely violent one that were kind of like produced a little bit.
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000 You know, that was, yeah, that was kind of odd.
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000 It was like weird.
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000 Oh, because I don't know who they were marketing to.
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000 I mean, I couldn't relate to the audience that they were marketing to.
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000 We'll say that.
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000 But yeah, and the other one, the nice one was odd because of like, what everything else they've been putting out.
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000 You know, then it was like, almost like this utopian commercial.
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:26.000 Yeah, that's the, that's a crazy world of, I guess, social media might have heard my due turn for the social media, emotional media.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:32.000 It's not only for social media, it's actually all media because every media right now is just emotional media.
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000 How can we make everyone hyper emotional?
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000 What story can we show to make everyone freak out?
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000 Let's do that.
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:47.000 What video can I tweet or share on the gram to make people get super crazy?
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000 Oh, yeah.
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000 Let's do that.
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000 Yeah, which one can we, can people retweet?
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000 That's a big one.
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000 Why would there be like, okay, this is like super retweetable?
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000 Because you can get all fired up and then you're going to say something along lines and you're head.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000 You can say something along lines up of,
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000 can you believe this guy said this?
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000 Boom, retweet.
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000 Everyone who agrees with you?
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000 Boom, they're going to feel the same way, hopefully retweet too.
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000 People, it's also actually some people that weren't really thinking about it, see that and they go, wait.
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000 Yeah.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000 Why?
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000 They get emotional.
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000 Yes.
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000 And then you get a whole, millions of people.
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000 Yeah.
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000 Um, next little sections is about causes,
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000 causes, causes, a principle or movement militantly defended or supported.
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000 In surgeons make create artificial contradictions using propaganda and misinformation.
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000 In surgeons have much to gain by not limiting themselves to a single cause.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000 In surgeons employed deep seated strategic causes as well as temporary local causes,
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000 adding or deleting them as circumstances demand.
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:04.000 You get this sort of whatever your, whatever your problem is with the government, like if you're an surgeon in Iraq,
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:12.000 people, people, you know, not only do they say, well, well, and Iraq, it was the, the bathis that been in charge forever.
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:19.000 And not only that, but we don't have whatever, you know, we don't, we don't, we don't, we don't get enough money for our oil.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000 Whatever grievance you have becomes part of something that we adopt.
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000 And that can happen inside any team, right? What starts off is, you know, if you're mad, you know,
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000 I'm telling I'm mad because we're using a new method and you're mad because we didn't get a pay raise.
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000 Guess what? Now we got it. We both, I'm mad about both now.
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000 I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm top, you're damn right.
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000 We need more money.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000 Yeah.
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000 And that's how the insurgency's grow.
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000 You start adopting all these different problems.
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000 Yeah.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000 All these different causes, unify them into one giant cause.
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000 Yeah.
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000 So it like solidifies the like enemy, like that's the enemy versus us.
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:08.000 And he country ruled by a small group of that broad, without broad popular participation provides a political cause for insurgence.
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.000 Exploited or repressed social groups by the entire, be they entire classes, that think groups are small.
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:22.000 And the elites may support larger causes in reaction to their own or narrower grievances.
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:28.000 So again, as a leader when you're looking at your team, in internal,
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:36.000 see that you might be getting multiple causes turned against you.
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000 Next section is about mobilizing resources.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:48.000 And obviously insurgence, well, resort to tactics such as guerrilla warfare and terrorism, not only because of their disadvantages,
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:56.000 manpower organization, but also because they usually begin with limited or inadequate resources compared to the counterinsurgence.
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.000 So that's why you end up with guerrilla warfare, asymmetrical warfare.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000 They talk about money, they talk about insurgency and crime,
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:11.000 system and requirements often drive insurgence into relationships with organized crime or inter-criminal activities themselves.
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000 This is absolutely true.
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000 I know the Iraqis had all kinds of crime going on.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000 So the insurgence had all kinds of crime going on.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000 Smuggling and black markets and the whole nine yards to try and pay for what they were doing.
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:30.000 And then, you know, in Afghanistan, they got this massive drug trade to support the insurgency.
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:36.000 So that's definitely something that can be problematic.
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:44.000 Elements of insurgency leaders, combatants, political cadre, exilaries and mass-base leaders control the insurgent movement.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000 They are the idea people and the planners.
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.000 They usually exercise leadership through force of personality, the power of revolutionary ideas.
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000 It's not an interesting, the power of revolutionary ideas.
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000 It's not kind of interesting, like you always hear me talk about how I was a rebellious kid.
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:06.000 And I was rebellious in my Navy career without a doubt.
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000 I was rebellious. I always have that kind of rebellious thing.
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:16.000 But the idea that the power of revolutionary idea of revolutionary ideas,
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:21.000 there's like a natural human kind of,
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000 there's a natural human draw to that. And you know what?
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:34.000 My best example of that, which you, my friend, will give me a full salute and credit for.
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000 Do you know what it is?
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000 What is the insurgency that you think of that everyone is drawn to and everyone supports?
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000 Surgency that everyone's drawn to.
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:52.000 Just about every human being supports one particular insurgency.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000 Individual responsibility.
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000 No. Star Wars.
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000 Star Wars.
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000 What's the deal?
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000 The movie.
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.000 Yeah, the movie.
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000 Who are the rebels?
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000 The rebels.
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000 Right? They're revolutionary.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000 That's what's happening.
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000 Why does why do these revolutionaries?
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:16.000 Why does she giveara? You don't have this t-shirt that everyone, because he's a revolutionary.
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000 Right? People like that.
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000 Is there just some weird?
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.000 I guess it's, can be kind of like rooting for the underdog.
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:31.000 Maybe there's some kind of attraction to that.
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000 That just naturally exists.
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.000 That's why when we watch Star Wars, no one says, hey, I hope the Empire wins, right?
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000 I don't want saying that.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000 Even the name the Empire.
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000 I see what's going on there.
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000 I mean, it's the American Revolution.
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000 The revolutionary ideas.
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000 People like that kind of thing.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000 Yeah, under, I mean, that's a kind of thing.
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000 You know why?
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000 I guess, you know what?
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000 I'm thinking through it psychologically.
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000 You know what? You like about it.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000 You know what's naturally attractive about it?
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000 You take all your grievances in life.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000 Right? I don't don't make enough money.
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000 I didn't end up where I wanted to end up.
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000 My girlfriend dumped me, my boyfriend dumped me.
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000 I don't like my house.
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000 I don't like my car.
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000 I don't like my apartment.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000 Whatever grievances you have, you can package all those things up,
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000 and you can point a finger at them, and you can say those things are all wrong.
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000 I'm being revolutionary over here.
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000 Yeah.
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000 Yeah, and you identify with that.
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000 I mean, back to the movie thing where you identify with the Empire.
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000 I really got my ass.
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000 I really got my ass.
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000 I'm going to open up a door.
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000 You're the one who said Star Wars.
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000 So you think what if they call it just the rebellion?
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000 What are they called? The Rebels?
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000 The Rebels? Yeah.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000 The Rebels? Yeah.
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000 The Belle in the Senate.
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000 Yeah.
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000 And you support them.
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000 They're the underdog versus the Empire.
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000 Yeah, but that's most movies, because I haven't seen most movies.
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000 But that's a lot of movies.
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000 The underdog.
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000 That's a lot of.
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000 It's kind of, to be honest, it seems like all of them.
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000 Like, brought karate kid, freck-end,
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000 broody, I don't know, name the Rambo. I don't know.
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000 Whatever movies you watch, whatever.
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000 Yeah, the underdog.
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000 Yeah.
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000 So those are the leaders.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000 They're going to capitalize on the power of revolutionary ideas.
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000 Is it even in marketing?
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000 Right, even in marketing people like this is a revolutionary new.
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000 Paraps sneakers are phone or whatever.
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000 Right.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000 Everyone is attracted to that idea.
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:34.000 Well, remember on Rambo first blood part two, this that time where he was hiding in the wall.
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000 Oh, yeah.
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000 It wasn't the wall.
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000 It was the mud wall, essentially, and then, you know, in Vietnam, whatever.
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000 And like he opened his eyes.
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000 You could only see his eye.
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000 And then he'd like undoes his fingers first.
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000 You know, then he comes out and kills everybody.
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000 That at the time was a revolutionary idea.
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000 Like, oh, he hid in the mud right there.
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000 That was kind of built the way he did it.
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000 You seems like.
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000 Right, they just, I think you just nailed it.
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000 But it's just captured all.
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000 Oh, yeah.
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000 They just captured all.
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000 Where else?
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000 Uh, combatants do the actual fighting and provide security.
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000 There's the political cadre.
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000 The cadre is the political core of the insurgency.
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000 They're actively engaged in the struggle to accomplish the insurgency goals.
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:23.000 Auxilaries are active sympathizers, active sympathizers who provide important support services.
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000 And then you get the mass base.
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000 And these are followers of the insurgent movement supporting the populace.
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:40.000 And again, so inside your organization, inside your team, you can identify who these people are when there's an insurgency going on.
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000 Right?
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000 There's the leaders of it.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000 Kind of, guess, they have this advantage of.
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000 They're standing up to the man, right?
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000 They're revolutionary.
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000 They got a little advantage there.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000 There's combatants that are actually going to try and make things happen.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:58.000 There's this cadre that's out there kind of, you know, run in their mouths and soings seeds of disc content.
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000 There's then there's sympathizers and the mass base.
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:08.000 So if you can identify who these people are, you can realize what you need to do to disrupt this insurgency from happening.
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000 Then isn't it weird that as we talk about this, I just had this instinct right now.
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:20.000 Even in my own head, right now as we're having this conversation, even I sympathize with the insurgency.
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.000 I'm thinking about, oh, I got this new idea and the man and all that stuff.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000 That's real.
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.000 That's real stuff that you feel.
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000 Maybe I think it's because we're American or is it a global thing?
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000 Like, are we American that were raised?
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000 Hey, you know, we're Americans, we're revolutionary.
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000 We rebel against the king.
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000 Maybe made our own country.
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000 We won't stand for this kind of, you know what I mean?
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000 That's America.
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000 But the thing is it's universal.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000 I feel like it's universal, yeah, because it's kind of like our need for balance.
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000 So you get like someone who just starts out, there's starting point as an underdog,
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.000 whether it be in a movie or in life or just in any situation that you're presented with.
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:11.000 If someone feels like an underdog, it just feels like an imbalance of some sort, power imbalance, whatever kind of imbalance.
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000 So we kind of, part of our mind, I think anyway, this is what it feels like when I, in the experience it.
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000 Part of your mind kind of wants it to be more balanced.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000 We want him to get out of that underdog situation.
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000 So when he does, it's like it's almost like a feeling of satisfaction, you know?
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000 It's almost like it feels like justice or something like that.
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000 It's like it feels so unfair.
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000 I'm balanced at this.
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000 The empires.
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000 We just like see the dog went.
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000 Yeah, that's what it is.
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000 Why it is, I think.
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000 That's what it feels like.
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000 I guess that's the traditional heroic.
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000 That's what it is.
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.000 That's the traditional, it's one of the traditional, whatever there are for heroic journeys.
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000 One of those heroic journeys is, you know, David and a lot of,
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000 a little guy stands up to the big guy and we all appreciate that.
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000 We're seeing Rocky Four.
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000 Which are I'll go, is that for you?
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000 For sure.
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000 That was a good one.
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000 Dynamics of an Insurgency, you got leadership objectives, ideology, environment, geography,
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000 external support and sanctuary, phasing and timing, leadership we know about.
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:23.000 One thing they say is extreme decentralization results in a movement that rarely functions as a coherent body.
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:34.000 So usually insurgency's are super decentralized, which means they have a hard time sort of coordinating mass movements together.
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000 Objectives, they got to have clear objectives.
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000 They got their ideology and narrative narratives, a word that gets thrown around all the time.
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000 What's the story that we're telling?
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000 Right, and how do we fit everything into the story that we're telling?
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000 Ideas are a motivating factor in insurgency, violence, insurgency's,
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.000 gather recruits in a mass popular support through ideological appeal recruits are often young men suffering from frustrated hopes.
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000 And unable to improve their lot in life, it's what I just said.
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000 The insurgency group provides them identity purpose and community and addition to physical, economic and psychological security.
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000 I mean, how just blatantly obvious is that.
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:28.000 The movement's ideology explains its followers tribulations and provides a course of action to remedy those ills.
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:35.000 You know, yeah, man, again, back to that balanced thing, you know, where we kind of want that.
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000 Like, think about this too, where, okay, there's this place, I don't know where.
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:48.000 I, I really, it wasn't Ireland, I don't think, I don't know, it was somewhere where you get like criminals, bad criminals, murders, like rapists type, guys or whatever,
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000 and the in jail, and it's not even called jail, I don't think.
01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:02.000 It's, it's essentially a rehab center, but in the rehab center, this is what you get. You get like pets and you get, it's essentially like a, for therapy to rehabilitate them.
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000 So there's punishment and then there's rehabilitation, right?
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000 They focus on no punishment, it's just rehabilitation and apparently from when I read it, whatever, it's like pretty successful.
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000 Here's the thing though, with that, it feels super unsatisfying.
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000 Because you get a guy who raped, you know, a lady, killed her, and then killed the husband or something like that, for example, he goes, no punishment.
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:33.000 He goes to this place where he gets pets, he gets, um, he can hang with girls, he can, he can make friends, he gets, like, um, he learns, like, stuff, skills, and stuff like that.
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000 He doesn't, he's not locked in a cell, he's at a little, like, a little resort kind of thing.
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000 Even even murderers.
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000 Even murders, yeah.
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000 Yeah.
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:41.000 100%.
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000 So yeah, there's no punishment part of it.
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000 So where's the no satisfaction coming?
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:58.000 But if that, the person, the victim of this criminal is like, your wife or something, and this guy gets to go to a resort, you're saying they, the victims have no satisfaction seeing this rehabilitation.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000 Exactly.
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000 They want to go blood for blood.
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.000 Yeah, it seems like that imbalance still remains because this guy gets to improve his life after he killed my wife.
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000 Me and one.
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000 Well, sure, it's murderers and everything.
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000 Yeah, that's what I read.
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000 That's why two of you are so problematic.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000 I don't know how well that would work here.
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000 Yeah.
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000 Because you get some, you get some vengeance going down.
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000 Oh, yeah.
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:27.000 But here was the thing in the point of the article was that there was, like, the, what do you call it when you go back to, like, you go to jail and then you get out, then you go back to jail.
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000 It's like, we're going back to the city going back to jail.
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000 Yeah.
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000 A recidivism.
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000 Yes, like relapse kind of thing.
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000 Yeah.
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000 The rate was so astronomically good that no one went back to jail.
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000 It was like that.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000 It was like it was so effective at rehabilitating the person.
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000 But meanwhile, when you think about it, man, there's still this massive imbalance.
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000 So people wouldn't be very happy with that.
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000 You seem saying.
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000 Yeah.
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000 But as a society, like as a whole, as far as groups, as far as criminals getting rehabilitated, which, I mean, how can you be against criminals being rehabilitated?
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000 Yeah.
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000 It's hard to be against that, you know.
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000 But we still don't get that satisfaction.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000 We need that, you know.
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000 It's like that imbalance.
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000 Yeah.
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000 Well, I just, back to this here, just this idea that you have.
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.000 And it, it says, you know, young men.
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000 You know, that's who we're talking about.
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000 We're talking about young men that are, that are unable to improve their lot in life.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:32.000 And this is how, how you end up with these people getting drawn into these super, usually extremists type organizations.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000 The most powerful ideologies tap.
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:45.000 Layton emotive concerns of the populace, such as the desire for justice, religious beliefs, or liberation from foreign occupation.
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.000 Ideologies provide a prison, including a vocabulary and analytical categories through which the situation is assessed.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000 Thus ideology can shape the movement's organization and operational method.
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000 You know, it's interesting.
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000 You start tracking on that.
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000 What do they call it here?
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:09.000 Vocab just vocabularies, what they call it, but you know, you track any sort of organization that's out there that sort of has a.
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000 You know, you look at some, some things you know, that's kind of got a weird culty feeling to it.
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:23.000 One of the main things that gives something a culty feeling is when you hear the vocabulary that's all being used and it's all.
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:30.000 Not just used, but it's used as like this weird kind of way to answer any questions and say,
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000 any questions and circular arguments and always comes back to these things and you're like, well, this is getting kind of funky over here.
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000 Yeah.
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000 Well, yeah.
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000 Very strange.
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000 Um,
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000 Environment geography, external support and sanctuaries.
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000 These are all just really getting into some of the details.
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000 I will stop at this one.
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000 No phasing and timing and surgencies often pass through common phases of development, not all.
01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000 In surgencies experience such phase development and progression through all phases is not a requirement for success.
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000 So there's different phases that you can go through and like I said earlier, and this way you got to pay attention.
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000 You don't have to go through every phase.
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000 You don't start at phase one and go to phase two and then you defeated at phase three.
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000 No, you can talk about phase two.
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000 You defeat phase two, they go back to phase one.
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000 Then you take all I think we're in control of the negative two again.
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000 Then they go back and forth.
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000 You got to pay attention to that.
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000 Talks about insurgent networks.
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000 Here's some of those insurgent vulnerabilities.
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000 Seekersy because they got to keep a secret.
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000 Sometimes they have trouble getting the word out there.
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000 Mobilization it can be hard for them to to mobilize support.
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000 For a couple reasons.
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000 One of the things they talk about here is to mobilize their base support and surgeon groups.
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:59.000 The post-commodation of propaganda intimidation and they may overreach in both counter insurgents should be able to use information operations to
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:06.000 effectively exploit in the insurgents message as well as their excessive uses of force for intimidation.
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:16.000 So definitely in Iraq the insurgents went overboard in trying to intimidate people and it pissed off the local populace.
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000 And it definitely pissed off the shakes in the battle of Romadi. Like they got pissed.
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000 And some of them left fled, some got scared, but some got mad.
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:34.000 And the local populace was saying, when I, as soon as they saw that there was enough American presence and Iraqi government presence to say,
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000 OK, thank you for being here. We'll help you get these back.
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000 Get bad guys out. They were on board.
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.000 Financial weakness. It's tough for them to find funding internal divisions.
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:54.000 This is an important one to pay attention to counter insurgents must remain alert for signs of divisions within an insurgent movement.
01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.000 Again, when you're dealing with a group of people and they're all masked against you,
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.000 look for those cracks. Look for ways that they're not sort of in unison.
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:14.000 And if you can exploit and expand those cracks, all of a sudden you can break down that their unification, which is a positive thing.
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000 And again, I have this little guilty thing in the back of my head that's I got.
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000 I don't want to break down the rebels.
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000 Because I've been programmed by Star Wars to support the rebels.
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000 And by the American Revolutionary War, that's why I identify with, we identify with the rebels.
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:38.000 You know, tell you an example of that. You've watched the matrix. And I know this is an arm rule. You know, you have this.
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.000 I've watched it. I like saw it one time in the theater. So I don't remember much about it.
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000 So there's this guy, African his name.
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000 The guy from bad boys. Anyway, you know him, he's actor.
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000 He definitely knows.
01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:03.000 He's not, what does his name not a pop? Anyway, it doesn't matter. So basically he's, so you know what the matrix is about right.
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000 Everyone's plugged in the matrix. And then meanwhile, more fierce, Lawrence Fishburn, more fierce saves all these people from the matrix, right?
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:19.000 And the real reality is not the only thing I remember this whole movie is when I think the main character says,
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000 I know jujitsu. I don't remember.
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000 Trying to get that download. Yeah, you got that. Yeah, for sure.
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000 So more of he's plugged everyone out of the matrix. Matrix is like everyday life.
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:39.000 You know, I'm just looking at the job and whatever you're living life or whatever, when you get plugged out of the matrix, the real reality is a straight up dystopia straight up.
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000 Machines running everything. You're living in, you know, in a post-apocalyptic times.
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:52.000 So this one guy, it starts to weigh on him apparently and he's like, I don't even like this. I kind of like to better in the matrix being ignorant.
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000 So he ends up teaming with the agents, which is like the agents of the matrix.
01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000 Correct, right.
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000 Is it roll or up?
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000 And be trained in the rebels. That's what that is right there that when you can, you find little slight divisions and then you exploit on, you know?
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:15.000 And he ran the risk of bringing down the whole team. Same same way, which team? You know, more fierce in the team.
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000 But he wanted to do that, right? Yeah. Yeah. So he didn't run the risk. He could have.
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000 Yeah.
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000 Wasn't a risk to him. He wanted to.
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000 Yeah, yeah.
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000 I'm sorry.
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000 Did he take the blue pill? Is that right?
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.000 No, he wish. He said, and this is what indicates that there was a fracture in it just a little bit of a division.
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000 When he, it was like one of the early scenes with him, he was talking to Neil, the main character.
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.000 And he was like, you're thinking this on paraphrasing. He's like, why didn't I take the blue pill?
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000 He was like saying, oh, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that.
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000 I mean, what I don't know if that's what you, you know, the blue pill is like you stay in the matrix.
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:51.000 Right.
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:59.000 Red pill is you see, you know? So basically he was indicating that he was sort of thinking of like that he regretted it a little bit kind of thing.
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000 You know, that was like the little fracture that they showed in the story.
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000 But then yeah. So yeah, they almost lost.
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000 But you know, matrix or more fiascent Neil, they're very powerful.
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000 They were able to keep it real.
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:24.000 This is the Hollywood podcast with echo Charles and echo Charles aspects of the counter surgery.
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:32.000 This is, so all that kind of it. I hate to say that was like the introduction, but this is where we get into aspects of counter insurgency.
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:38.000 This is how we actually overcome the insurgency.
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:49.000 You know, once every case, the counter insurgent faces a popular containing an active minority supporting a government and a similar militant faction opposing it.
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:59.000 And they kind of lay out, oh, it looks pretty much like a bell curve. Whatever the cause, there will be an active minority that totally supports the cause.
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000 There'll be a neutral or passive. That's the majority of people are just, hey, we don't really care.
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:15.000 And then you've got an active minority against the cause, which this is something important to think about in life, especially in, well, like right now in America, that you, who do you hear from?
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:32.000 You hear from the two way far extreme ends of the spectrum. Everyone else is just, you know, just trying to live a life and do the right thing and feels, you know, consider things sort of as a group, you know, like all pretty much the same.
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:38.000 Hey, this is, yeah, this makes sense. This doesn't make sense. This is smart. This isn't smart.
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:51.000 And then there's people on the spectrums, I mean, on the outside of the spectrum that are jumping up and down screaming and getting crazy. They are not the majority of humans. They're small number of people.
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000 But boy, they make a lot of noise. They call them what the vocal minority. Yeah. Yeah.
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:05.000 Yeah. I think some, some majority was Nixon originally said that.
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:19.000 Upon assuming coin mission soldiers and Marines must not only be prepared to identify their opponents and approaches to insurgency. They are applying counter insurgency must also understand the broader strategic context within which they're operating.
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000 So you need to think about the bigger picture. Obviously.
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000 Historical principles.
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:46.000 Number one. Legitimacy is the main objective. The primary objective of any counter insurgeon is to foster the development of effective governance by legitimate government.
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:53.000 All governments rule through a combination of consent and coercion.
01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:01.000 Now think about that from the leadership perspective. All leaders just think of, I said, all leaders rule through a combination of consent and coercion. That makes sense, right?
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:14.000 Coirs and people do and they're consenting, they're saying, okay, we'll do it. Governments described as legitimate rule primarily with the consent of the governed.
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:24.000 All those rule does illegitimate tend to mainly rely on coercion, like making and forcing people do things, which you probably heard me say this,
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:32.000 an echelon front events, you know, when I, I'm always saying, well, I never really had to order anyone to do anything.
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000 We would just kind of talk about it and things would happen.
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000 Why? Because I was legitimately in these positions.
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:50.000 I was just, I got, I have the rank and that's why I'm in a position like, no, I have some experience. I listen to other people like, that's what's good.
01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:01.000 Citizens obey the state. Oh, this is talking about the illegitimate. So if you're an illegitimate leader, the citizens obey the state for fear of the consequences of doing otherwise,
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:11.000 rather than because they voluntarily accept a rule, a government that derives its power from the governed tends to be accepted by the citizens as legitimate.
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.000 So if you're, if you're elected, right? If that's where you got your power from, then it's usually considered a legitimate.
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:24.000 It still uses coercion, for example, against criminals, but the bulk of the population voluntarily accepts its governance.
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:34.000 In Western liberal tradition, a government that derives its just powers from the people and response to the desires while looking out for their welfare is accepted as legitimate.
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000 So that's your goal as a leader.
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:45.000 And any time that you rely on a leader, on your rank, on your authority, on your power, any time you're doing that, you're taking away from your legitimacy.
01:15:45.000 --> 01:16:04.000 Legitimate legitimacy makes it easier for the state to carry out its key functions, which include the capability to regulate social relationships, extract resources and appropriate and appropriate or use resources in determined ways.
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:24.000 That is not legitimate isn't inherently unstable because as soon as the state's coercive powers disrupted the population ceases to obey it. This is when you hear me talking about, hey, you might be, you know, if I, if I bark and if I'm your boss and I say echo you better wear your gloves when you're in this compound.
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:33.000 Or I'm going to fire you, right? You're going to do it, but when I'm not there, you're not going to do it.
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:51.000 So so this is why that type of leadership doesn't work coercive leadership threatening people. That's why it doesn't work. It's not freaking legitimate.
01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:01.000 The leaders of legitimacy can be used to analyze frequent selection of leaders in a manner considered just in fair by a substantial majority of the population.
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:19.000 That includes promotions, right? If people are getting promoted for good reasons that makes sense, then they're considered to be more legitimate. A high level of popular participation in or support for the political process, a low level of corruption.
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000 And you as a leader do things that you know are right.
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000 When you make little maneuvers that you shouldn't be making, guess what?
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:44.000 Your level of legitimacy goes down, you need to maintain a high ground, a culturally acceptable level or rate of political economic and social development, a high level of regime acceptance by major social institutions.
01:17:44.000 --> 01:18:00.000 Governments that score high in these categories probably have the support of an adequate majority of population. As as leaders that score well in these areas are also going to have a high level of support.
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:20.000 Military action can address these symptoms of a loss of legitimacy. However, restoring legitimacy can only be accomplished using all instruments of national power without the host nation government achieving legitimacy, coin cannot succeed.
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:32.000 So you can beat people down all day long. That doesn't give you legitimacy. You can solve tactical problems with military might with brute force.
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000 Doesn't help you.
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000 Do you can't win with that?
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:53.000 In a crazy, you think this big military manual, you cannot win with just military force. You cannot beat someone in this submission. It doesn't work. Well, it doesn't work on a long term scale.
01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:22.000 A couple of other things here. Unity of effort is essential. That's true with any leadership. Political factors are primary. One of the generals from Mousée Dung's central committee, one stated that revolutionary war was 80% political action and 20% military action. 80% of it is a political action. 80% of it is maneuvering.
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:32.000 Understand the local environment you have to do this. Here's a couple. The local population is critical center of gravity of an insurgency.
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:40.000 Successful conduct of counterinsurgency operation depends on thoroughly understanding the society and culture within which they're being conducted.
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:52.000 The main thing is to understand the following about the population area in the area of operations. How key groups of society are organized, relationships and tensions above them ideologies and narratives that resonate with the groups.
01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:04.000 Group interests and motivations means by which groups communicate the society's leadership system. And what's so funny about this is.
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:16.000 The national on front when we go and consult with a company, these are the things that we're trying to figure out during our assessment phase. We're trying to figure out, okay, we figured out how their task organized, what's the one they set up like.
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000 Then we start going one of the relationships where the tensions.
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:32.000 What narratives resonate with the group with the different groups, right? You got the front line leaders that are saying, oh, they never do that. You got the senior leadership that's saying, oh, what would they know.
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000 You see what I'm saying there's the narratives that we're trying to group interest and motivations. You got to know what those are.
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:49.000 It means by which the groups communicate. How do they actually talk to each other? Is there an open line of communication? So these are all things that we look at to figure out how we fix leadership inside of a company.
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:58.000 Do you do that because like, did you get that straight from here? Or do you just happen to do that and boom this, apparently?
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.000 Well, we don't just happen to do that in order to solve the problems inside of a company. You have to understand these things.
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:13.000 You, you knew that for sure. Yes. Yes. But did you get it from that? I get what you're saying. No, I didn't get it from that.
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:25.000 But when you know the way broadly, you see it and all things. And I'm sure as I work with companies, you start saying, well, how's your relationship with that department over there?
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:36.000 And so, so explain to me what you think, where you think the company's going, right? What's the narrative? Just lines up because you have to figure these things out.
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:44.000 Do you go in kind of like good cop, bad cop? You know, when you don't have to, you don't have to cop, you don't have to cop, because
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:56.000 everybody knows that we're there to help. Right? There's no, we're not trying to bust them. We're trying to help. Right? Yes. People tell us everything that they, you know, they, they're very open and honest with us.
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:05.000 Yeah. Do you, do you ever do like little slie things like, and I guess I shouldn't say, slie because you know how like if you're really trying to ask
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:15.000 this question, but you can't just come out and ask that question because you can't expect them to just come out and give you that straight dope answer. You so you kind of ask these other questions to kind of get a
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.000 What you want to know is are there interrogation tactics that are being utilized when interviewing the personnel that we are consulted.
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:29.000 That's your question. Yes, of course. You know, but I mean, it's not there, you're right that they're not slie.
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:37.000 It's like we're getting information from people that they want to tell us. It's not it's not we don't have to set them up or
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:47.000 Coers them to say things or we don't have to. We talk to them. Yeah. Here's the advantage that we have is people want their company to be successful.
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:56.000 And so when you ask them, hey, what works well, they tell you when you say, hey, are there any issues? They tell you because they want they want to have those issues fixed.
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:10.000 And the easiest part of the job is gathering this information. Knowing what information to gather is important, but the easiest part of the job is gathering this information because people are over there just they're just more than happy to tell us what's going on.
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000 Yeah, makes sense.
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:26.000 Couple things that are required of soldiers and marines at every echelon when you when you need to know about the cultural context.
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.000 You got to have a clear nuanced and empathetic appreciation of the essential nature of the conflict.
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.000 So you got to hear and listen to both sides. Wouldn't that it does not make sense.
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000 Yeah, and essentially like had some understanding.
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.000 Like, hey, and empathy. Yeah, yeah, like I could see how you think that I could see where you're coming from.
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:56.000 Yeah, that's a good idea to have in your head for life or living for being a human.
01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:03.000 It's so true. Like the idea that like someone just doesn't get where that person's coming from.
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000 It's almost like, but that's just because a lack of effort, you know?
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000 And here's the deal. You're missing out.
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:19.000 You're missing out. If I argue with you and I don't listen to what you're saying and I don't see what your viewpoint is, there's no way I can defeat you in an argument.
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000 I don't understand you. How can I defeat you in an argument? Unless I understand where you're coming from.
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000 And not necessarily even defeat you. How can I find a solution if I don't understand where you're coming from?
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000 I'm not looking defeat you in an argument. That's what you do when you're 20.
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000 That's what you do when you're 23 defeat people in arguments.
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:46.000 When you're hopefully by the time you're 48 like me, you actually don't want to defeat someone you want to find a solution.
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000 There's a lot of arguing that happens. Just broadly.
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:57.000 I mean, right now we're seeing it all day long every day in the emotional media, social media, mainstream media.
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:04.000 It's just total, no listening, all talking, no perspective, no empathy.
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000 It's, well, I shouldn't say no because there are a lot of people that are actually listening.
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000 Trying to figure out what the solution is.
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000 But, but many people, they don't want to try and figure out what the solution is.
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000 They want to defeat the other person in an argument, which is so pointless.
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:26.000 So then you need to understand the motivation strengths and weaknesses of the insurgents.
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000 That's obviously important.
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000 You want to conduct intelligence drives driven operations.
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000 And meaning we want to actually pay attention to what's going on when a gather good intel.
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000 I slate insurgents from their cause and support.
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000 Smart move.
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:53.000 A stabless security under the rule of law, the cornerstone of any coin effort is security for the civilian population.
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.000 And this is probably the number two line that I stole from this.
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:05.000 Thank you General Mattis. Thank you General Patreis because when I had to start discussing up the chain of command.
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000 What we were doing, why were we doing it?
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000 It was this line right here.
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000 The cornerstone of any counter insurgency effort is security for the civilian populace.
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:26.000 Because what we were doing, task in a bruiser, was going out and killing bad guys in order to protect the civilian populace.
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:32.000 And that right there is the cornerstone of counter insurgency.
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:46.000 So we were able to just get all of our missions approved up the chain of command because what we were doing was in support of the cornerstone of counter insurgency.
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:54.000 Thank you for getting those chapters out early enough that I had this to lean on.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:06.000 illegitimate actions, this is just some illegitimate actions by government officials, security forces and multinational partners are those involving the use of power without authority.
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000 Oh wow.
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000 Power without authority.
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:22.000 When you use power without authority or you abuse power, you illegitimize yourself.
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:30.000 Every action by counter insurgency leaves a forensic trace that may need to be used in a court of law.
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:41.000 Counter insurgency's document all the activities to preserve whatever possible a chain of evidence and more importantly, as it means to insurgent propaganda.
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.000 This is epic and I'll tell you why.
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:58.000 Because inside businesses you make some little move, you make some little move and you think no one's going to know it.
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000 But it leaves a forensic trace.
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:10.000 And that's just a different way of saying, you know, I am always telling people everyone's watching you and if you try and lie to them, they know it.
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:18.000 That's what's happening. That's 100% what's happening. You try and lie to somebody, they know it. You try and make a maneuver on somebody.
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:26.000 There's a forensic trace and they know it. Don't do your little maneuvers to try and take care of yourself.
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000 Prepare for a long term commitment.
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:36.000 Back to that protracted war idea.
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000 Contemporary imperatives of counter insurgency.
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000 Manage information and expectations.
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.000 Achieving steady progress towards a set of reasonable expectations can increase the population's tolerance for the inevitable.
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000 Inconvenience entailed by ongoing counter insurgency operations.
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000 So just setting good expectations.
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:05.000 Setting good realistic expectations and then moving towards them so that you can look around at the team and say, hey, look, we're making progress.
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000 This is where we're going and this is how we're getting there. We're making progress.
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:17.000 Both the insurgency and the host government ensure that their deeds match their words.
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000 Do what you say, say what you do.
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000 Here's the other thing that triggered me into talking about this.
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000 Use measured force.
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:38.000 Any use of force generates a series of reactions. There may be times when an overwhelming effort is necessary to intimidate an opponent or reassure the populace.
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:46.000 But the type and amount of force to be applied and who wields it should be carefully calculated by a counter insertion for any operation.
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000 An operation that kills five insurgences counterproductive.
01:29:50.000 --> 01:30:00.000 If the collateral damage of the creation of blood fuels or the creation of blood feuds leads to the recruitment of 50 more.
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:11.000 Now this was a little bit strange because there was some of that idea that, oh, every time you kill an insurgen, you create five more.
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000 I would definitely hear that. I didn't see it.
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:25.000 What I actually saw was the opposite when we would kill an insurgen, the local populace would be like, okay, it was they got involved and they got braver.
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000 They got tougher. They gave us more support.
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000 What did they say that? What was their thought?
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:42.000 The thought is, hey, you know, if you kill, if you, they see you kill, you know, some kid, some family member, right?
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:49.000 Some family member gets killed and you think, okay, well, we just created news five brothers and now they're mad.
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000 But actually, oftentimes it was like, hey, don't follow what Freddie did.
01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:02.000 We know what we know he was doing bad stuff and he got killed and they kind of got it.
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:09.000 And I'll tell you what, they also, to a huge extent understood collateral damage.
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000 The local populace understood collateral damage.
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:24.000 So if we blew up a building or blew up a door and we entered a building and it shattered the windows and it turns out that we, you know, it was either the wrong building or whatever.
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000 And we'd say, okay, you know what, hey, here's a bunch of, we'd give them a bunch of money.
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000 We'd apologize, we'd say what happened, explain to them.
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000 And they would be like, yeah, well, you are at war.
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.000 Yeah, you know, they, and they would, and this is how I know that this is real.
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000 Is it give us information?
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:41.000 Yeah.
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000 They'd say, oh, yeah, I know you're looking for, you're looking for that guy.
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000 Yeah, he's, he's been gone for two weeks.
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:47.000 Yeah.
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000 And then we'd say, yeah, thanks, but we know it's our fault.
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000 Here's some money.
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:52.000 Yeah.
01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:01.000 It's weird how like to hear it, you know, because you know, you get whether it be reports or like, you just heard from someone someone who has a different,
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:10.000 I don't want to say agenda necessarily, but, you know, like if someone's against the war or something, like that's kind of their, their deal, you know, so they're kind of trying to input, not input.
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000 They're trying to convince that.
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:20.000 And I don't want to paint this, you know, beautiful picture because obviously there's obviously, there's obviously times where, you know, there's one of those brother gets killed.
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000 And one of the other brothers says, I'm going to go avenge, you know, go avenge.
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000 But you know what, it's think about in a family, right?
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000 The mom and dad, there's four brothers.
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:38.000 One of the, one of the brothers is out doing insurgent stuff.
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000 And he gets killed.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.000 Yeah.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:48.000 The mom and dad are looking at the other brothers going, hey, do not go and do what your brother does that happen all the time?
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000 No, not all the time.
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000 Sometimes the, you know, the dad says, well, avenge, you know, we're go avenge your brother.
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000 Right.
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000 Not usually.
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000 Yeah.
01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:03.000 And then yeah, the point is to where you, you, from the outside, you kind of hear someone's argument and you, and you kind of like, well, that makes sense.
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000 Yeah, just like you said, where you, where it's like, yeah, the brother got killed.
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000 If you're probably got killed, you would at the very least have some feelings of vengeance.
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000 It's a very least.
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000 Not to mention people who live in a war zone who are down for the fight a lot of the time, right?
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.000 You're going to see their brother get killed.
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000 They're like, hell, yeah, I'm going to come avenge.
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000 That, that does it.
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000 It's sick out as a lie to me.
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000 It's so, yeah, and it is true. The problem is it's very simplified.
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000 Yeah, right?
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:35.000 Because because what's really happened, what's really happening is the dad is going, hey, do you remember Saddam Hussein?
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000 He was horrible.
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:42.000 These Americans came and kicked his ass and got him out of here and, and now we're moving in the right direction now.
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000 You want to go fight them.
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000 What's wrong with you?
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000 And then that guy gets up and killed.
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000 And the girls looks at the brothers said, you see what happens?
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000 Yeah.
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:49.000 Yeah.
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000 And see, and when you explain that, you're kind of like, well, that makes sense.
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000 It's really easy just to stereotype and throw everyone with a broad brush and say,
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000 Oh, they're, they, everyone thinks like this.
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000 Yeah.
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000 It's totally not true, man.
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000 Even in a family, there'd be some kids would be insurgents, some kids wouldn't.
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.000 Yeah.
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000 And that's not to mention like some of the terror that these normal families have been, you know,
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000 Absolutely.
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000 inflicted on them.
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000 And then it's like,
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000 Yeah.
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:17.000 Okay.
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000 When you say they understand collateral damage,
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.000 just kind of like, the way you said is almost like, and which is actually correct from my perspective,
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000 where it sounds obvious, everyone understands collateral damage.
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000 You know, like, everyone kind of understands that, you know,
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000 but so why would we assume that they don't?
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000 Like everyone should do your thing.
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:36.000 Exactly.
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000 So when you say, you're like, well, of course we do humanize.
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:40.000 Yeah.
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000 We do humanize that local populist and think that, oh, they're just,
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000 Here's a common emotion.
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000 You blew up my door.
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000 I'm mad.
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000 I'm going to fight you now.
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000 When it's really, when actually you're dealing with human beings,
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000 and we people forget that we're dealing with human beings that are smart,
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000 and they think, oh, you blew up their door.
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000 Now they're going to want to plan a roadside bomb.
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.000 No.
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000 Actually when you've all of their door and you say, hey, we're looking for this guy.
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000 And he wasn't here.
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.000 Do you know where he is?
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000 Yeah.
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000 He's been gone for two weeks.
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000 Hey, sorry about your door.
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000 Here's some money.
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000 By the way, we're going to set a team out here and be hang a new door for you,
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000 which we did.
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000 Yeah.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000 And they go, yeah, appreciate it.
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000 You know, please, please let your friends know that there's no bad guys that live here.
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000 And by the way, the only problems we've had on the street is that building down there.
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000 There's been some people in and out of there.
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000 You might want to keep an eye on it.
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000 Yeah.
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000 Okay, cool. Thank you.
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:30.000 Yeah.
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000 And see, even hearing that, it's like, brother, that makes sense.
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000 In fact, that sounds more likely if you were in that situation.
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000 That's what I'm saying.
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000 So this idea that every time one, you know, you kill a person,
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000 you kill a bad guy, that now five more.
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.000 That's totally untrue.
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000 And not to mention, there's some people that, oh, shh,
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000 I don't want to go get involved with that.
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000 Right?
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000 Yeah.
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000 I mean, that's what they say, there's a high deterrence level.
01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.000 There's a very strong deterrence level because what people missed out on is just the,
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000 like you said.
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000 And the way I always explain Iraqi families, I'm like, oh, you wanted to know an Iraqi family is like,
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000 they're like a family.
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000 Yeah.
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000 They're like a family.
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000 And there's, be, you know, the dad's got this and the mom's got this going on and the kids.
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.46 They've got a rebellious kid, right?
01:36:15.46 --> 01:36:16.68 You go into one of the rooms,
01:36:16.68 --> 01:36:19.78 there's like weird pictures of whatever,
01:36:19.78 --> 01:36:23.26 Iraqi movie stars, music stars,
01:36:23.26 --> 01:36:26.94 and like, they're just people.
01:36:26.94 --> 01:36:31.94 And we just paint them with this broad brush of how we think
01:36:32.58 --> 01:36:36.14 they will react or how we've been told that they'll react.
01:36:36.14 --> 01:36:43.26 And it's just not true. God,
01:36:43.26 --> 01:36:45.58 a learner and a dapped.
01:36:45.58 --> 01:36:47.86 Oh, before I go there, who wields force?
01:36:47.86 --> 01:36:49.86 Who wields force is also important?
01:36:49.86 --> 01:36:52.14 Providing the police have a reasonable reputation
01:36:52.14 --> 01:36:54.34 for confidence and impartiality.
01:36:54.34 --> 01:36:56.30 It is better to let police and these are police
01:36:56.30 --> 01:37:00.14 that are local police handle urban raids,
01:37:00.14 --> 01:37:02.90 rather than soldiers and Marines, even if the police are not
01:37:02.90 --> 01:37:05.86 as well armed or as capable as military units,
01:37:05.86 --> 01:37:07.70 since the populous is likely to view
01:37:07.70 --> 01:37:09.94 that application of force as more legitimate.
01:37:09.94 --> 01:37:12.46 So you want the Iraqis to handle their own problems.
01:37:12.46 --> 01:37:15.54 Now, in Romadi, there was what made it tricky
01:37:15.54 --> 01:37:18.78 is a lot of the Iraqi army soldiers,
01:37:18.78 --> 01:37:21.38 were Shia and the local populist in Romadi,
01:37:21.38 --> 01:37:22.18 was Sunni.
01:37:22.18 --> 01:37:23.86 That's why as quickly as we could,
01:37:23.86 --> 01:37:27.26 we got the Sunni policeman, Iraqi policeman
01:37:27.26 --> 01:37:30.46 that were from Romadi to start doing these kind of things.
01:37:30.46 --> 01:37:31.46 Because there was more.
01:37:31.46 --> 01:37:33.34 In some cases, not in all cases,
01:37:33.34 --> 01:37:35.30 in some cases there was more tension
01:37:35.30 --> 01:37:40.06 between the Shia soldiers and the local populist
01:37:40.06 --> 01:37:42.06 than it was between the Americans and the local populist.
01:37:45.70 --> 01:37:48.06 Learn and adapt, an effective counter-insurgent force
01:37:48.06 --> 01:37:49.82 is a learning organization, right?
01:37:49.82 --> 01:37:55.06 Back to our podcast we did with Dave Burke.
01:37:55.06 --> 01:37:55.94 Good deal, Dave.
01:37:58.58 --> 01:38:01.66 Empower the lowest levels.
01:38:01.66 --> 01:38:05.42 Mission command is the conduct of military operations
01:38:05.42 --> 01:38:09.02 through decentralized execution based upon mission orders
01:38:09.02 --> 01:38:12.26 for effective mission accomplishment.
01:38:12.26 --> 01:38:14.22 What does that mean?
01:38:14.22 --> 01:38:16.50 It means higher commanders and power subordinates
01:38:16.50 --> 01:38:18.34 to make decision with the commanders intent.
01:38:18.34 --> 01:38:20.66 They leave details of execution to their subordinates
01:38:20.66 --> 01:38:22.46 and require them to use initiative
01:38:22.46 --> 01:38:24.02 and judgment to accomplish the mission.
01:38:24.02 --> 01:38:25.86 Decentralized command, thank you.
01:38:25.86 --> 01:38:30.86 Support the host nation.
01:38:31.98 --> 01:38:34.54 And one, the little part I wanted to pull out
01:38:34.54 --> 01:38:36.42 of this support the host nation thing is
01:38:38.10 --> 01:38:39.94 American forces committed to coin
01:38:39.94 --> 01:38:42.74 are there to assist a host government.
01:38:42.74 --> 01:38:44.22 The long-term goal is to leave a host
01:38:44.22 --> 01:38:46.26 that is capable of standing on its own too feet.
01:38:46.26 --> 01:38:47.82 To feet.
01:38:47.82 --> 01:38:51.10 In that end, the host nation has to win its own war.
01:38:53.30 --> 01:38:55.62 Achieving this requires the development of violence,
01:38:55.62 --> 01:38:58.46 local leaders and institutions.
01:38:58.46 --> 01:39:00.30 U.S. forces and agencies can help
01:39:00.30 --> 01:39:02.26 but host nation elements must be able
01:39:02.26 --> 01:39:05.26 to accept responsibility to achieve real victory.
01:39:05.26 --> 01:39:10.26 And then it goes on to warn that you can't be the easy button.
01:39:10.26 --> 01:39:11.94 When something needs to happen, you can say,
01:39:11.94 --> 01:39:12.90 okay, well, where America is?
01:39:12.90 --> 01:39:13.74 We can make that happen.
01:39:13.74 --> 01:39:16.58 No, you need to actually not be the easy button.
01:39:18.70 --> 01:39:19.70 And,
01:39:21.06 --> 01:39:22.90 it's one of the last sections here.
01:39:22.90 --> 01:39:26.58 It's called paradoxes of the counterinsurgency,
01:39:27.58 --> 01:39:29.02 which if I would have named this section,
01:39:29.02 --> 01:39:32.54 what have been called the dichotomies of counterinsurgency,
01:39:32.54 --> 01:39:34.14 but you know what we're saying.
01:39:35.94 --> 01:39:38.66 Principles and imperatives discussed above reveal
01:39:38.66 --> 01:39:42.38 that coin presents a complex and often unfamiliar set
01:39:42.38 --> 01:39:44.58 of missions and considerations for military commander.
01:39:44.58 --> 01:39:46.78 In many ways, the conduct of the counterinsurgency
01:39:46.78 --> 01:39:50.50 is counterintuitive to a traditional American view of war.
01:39:50.50 --> 01:39:52.42 And that right there, that statement is why
01:39:52.42 --> 01:39:54.66 I'm saying, if you're gonna start to overlay
01:39:56.82 --> 01:40:00.70 warfare principles in your business and your life,
01:40:00.70 --> 01:40:03.58 you need to also include counterinsurgency in there
01:40:03.58 --> 01:40:06.22 because sometimes they're counterintuitive,
01:40:06.22 --> 01:40:08.06 sometimes they're different than traditionally
01:40:08.06 --> 01:40:09.22 the way you think of war.
01:40:09.22 --> 01:40:12.14 And I think this attitude, this whole attitude
01:40:13.30 --> 01:40:17.90 is so important to be able to take war fighting
01:40:17.90 --> 01:40:20.30 and overlay it into other scenarios.
01:40:20.30 --> 01:40:24.10 If you only know how to fight a conventional war of attrition,
01:40:24.10 --> 01:40:26.10 you can't overlay those principles
01:40:27.10 --> 01:40:28.74 over either rest of your life.
01:40:28.74 --> 01:40:30.34 They won't work all the time.
01:40:30.34 --> 01:40:31.38 They're not nuanced enough.
01:40:31.38 --> 01:40:32.22 They don't understand.
01:40:32.22 --> 01:40:33.78 They don't understand the complexities.
01:40:34.90 --> 01:40:38.38 And one of those complexities is there's paradoxes
01:40:38.38 --> 01:40:40.62 and there's dichotomies.
01:40:43.02 --> 01:40:45.98 Number one, the more you protect your force,
01:40:45.98 --> 01:40:50.98 the less secure you are. What does that mean?
01:40:52.94 --> 01:40:55.26 Do you have to take risks?
01:40:55.26 --> 01:40:59.22 And when you take risks, when you get outside the wire,
01:40:59.22 --> 01:41:01.06 when you go work with a local populist,
01:41:01.06 --> 01:41:04.26 the more secure you'll end up being.
01:41:04.26 --> 01:41:07.66 So as a leader, if you stay locked up in your office,
01:41:07.66 --> 01:41:08.94 you feel like you're safe in there
01:41:08.94 --> 01:41:12.06 because you're not out there getting engaged with people,
01:41:12.06 --> 01:41:17.06 I'm not gonna ask tough questions, the less secure you are.
01:41:17.06 --> 01:41:18.38 You need to get out there.
01:41:19.70 --> 01:41:22.66 Next one, the more force used, the less effective it is.
01:41:22.66 --> 01:41:25.26 Boom, when you're barking orders,
01:41:25.26 --> 01:41:27.14 when you're yelling at people,
01:41:27.14 --> 01:41:29.82 when you're saying you better do this or all fire you,
01:41:29.82 --> 01:41:33.34 whatever those things are, the more force you use as a leader,
01:41:33.34 --> 01:41:34.54 the less effective it is.
01:41:34.54 --> 01:41:36.22 When you use the minimum force required,
01:41:36.22 --> 01:41:37.50 that's the most powerful.
01:41:38.86 --> 01:41:40.22 The next is the more successful,
01:41:40.22 --> 01:41:43.14 the more the more the force that can be used
01:41:43.14 --> 01:41:45.70 and the more risk that must be accepted.
01:41:47.02 --> 01:41:50.10 So as you proceed down the path,
01:41:50.10 --> 01:41:52.54 you need to use less and less force
01:41:52.54 --> 01:41:54.98 and you have to take more and more risk, which is crazy.
01:41:58.98 --> 01:42:02.42 The initial reaction to the counter insurgency push
01:42:02.42 --> 01:42:05.06 and Ramadi was, enemy attacks are going up
01:42:05.06 --> 01:42:07.46 and American casualties are going up.
01:42:07.46 --> 01:42:08.30 And guess what?
01:42:08.30 --> 01:42:13.30 There's true. So some people up the chain of command,
01:42:13.58 --> 01:42:16.34 not my chain of, well, yes, all up the chain of command.
01:42:16.34 --> 01:42:18.14 Everyone was saying, wait, there's more,
01:42:18.14 --> 01:42:19.06 what's happening?
01:42:19.06 --> 01:42:21.66 There's more enemy attacks and there's more American casualties.
01:42:21.66 --> 01:42:22.50 This isn't working.
01:42:22.50 --> 01:42:24.98 No, actually, that's exactly what's gonna happen.
01:42:30.66 --> 01:42:34.06 Sometimes doing nothing is the best reaction.
01:42:34.06 --> 01:42:38.86 Often an insurgent carries out a terrorist or gorilla act
01:42:38.86 --> 01:42:42.02 with a primary purpose of enticing the counter insurgent
01:42:42.02 --> 01:42:44.62 to overreact or at least react in a way
01:42:44.62 --> 01:42:45.98 that can be exploited.
01:42:45.98 --> 01:42:47.82 If a careful assessment of the effects
01:42:47.82 --> 01:42:50.38 of a course of action concludes that more negative
01:42:50.38 --> 01:42:52.26 than positive effects will result,
01:42:52.26 --> 01:42:54.42 an alternative should be considered potentially
01:42:54.42 --> 01:42:56.38 including a decision not to act.
01:42:56.38 --> 01:42:59.58 Now this is, you know, default aggressive.
01:42:59.58 --> 01:43:00.86 This is not default aggressive.
01:43:00.86 --> 01:43:03.26 Hmm, bias for action.
01:43:03.26 --> 01:43:05.86 This is not taking action, but default aggressive
01:43:05.86 --> 01:43:07.50 and bias for action, bias for action
01:43:07.50 --> 01:43:09.38 what the Marine Corps says they want Marines to act.
01:43:09.38 --> 01:43:11.82 They want them to have a bias to actually do something.
01:43:11.82 --> 01:43:13.42 They want a bias to take action.
01:43:13.42 --> 01:43:15.58 Default aggressive is an echelon front.
01:43:15.58 --> 01:43:17.94 This is me telling young junior officers in the seal team,
01:43:17.94 --> 01:43:21.02 hey, your default has gotta be go take action.
01:43:21.02 --> 01:43:22.22 Make something happen.
01:43:22.22 --> 01:43:25.30 But both bias for action and default aggressive,
01:43:25.30 --> 01:43:29.70 neither one of those say 100% go.
01:43:29.70 --> 01:43:33.10 No, it's default, meaning that's what your default is,
01:43:33.10 --> 01:43:34.38 but you might have to adjust it.
01:43:34.38 --> 01:43:36.02 Bias for action doesn't mean you take action,
01:43:36.02 --> 01:43:38.90 means you lean towards taking action.
01:43:38.90 --> 01:43:41.06 Sometimes you need to look at the situation
01:43:41.06 --> 01:43:42.38 and say you know what's gonna help you?
01:43:42.38 --> 01:43:43.22 Nothing.
01:43:46.22 --> 01:43:50.02 The best weapons for coin do not shoot.
01:43:51.94 --> 01:43:55.10 Counter-insurgents achieve the most meaningful success
01:43:55.10 --> 01:43:57.70 by gaining popular support and legitimacy
01:43:57.70 --> 01:43:59.26 for the host government.
01:43:59.26 --> 01:44:04.26 So how often is it that you as a leader can make more progress
01:44:05.46 --> 01:44:08.62 by instead of telling someone,
01:44:08.62 --> 01:44:09.94 no, we're gonna do it my way
01:44:09.94 --> 01:44:11.82 instead of shooting them in the face without you saying,
01:44:11.82 --> 01:44:13.66 okay, your way sounds good.
01:44:13.66 --> 01:44:16.38 You make you increase your legitimacy
01:44:17.78 --> 01:44:21.74 as opposed to decreasing it when you fire one off in their face.
01:44:25.46 --> 01:44:27.30 The host nation doing something tolerably
01:44:27.30 --> 01:44:30.30 is better than us doing it well.
01:44:31.50 --> 01:44:33.38 Hey, as a leader when you got a support leader,
01:44:33.38 --> 01:44:36.18 you know you can do it better than your support.
01:44:36.18 --> 01:44:38.90 But it's oftentimes better to let them do it.
01:44:38.90 --> 01:44:39.78 Good enough.
01:44:42.70 --> 01:44:45.46 If a tactic works this week, it might not work next week.
01:44:45.46 --> 01:44:47.50 If it works and this province,
01:44:47.50 --> 01:44:49.42 it might not work in the next.
01:44:49.42 --> 01:44:50.98 You gotta keep an open mind.
01:44:50.98 --> 01:44:52.58 You gotta change, you gotta adapt.
01:44:52.58 --> 01:44:57.58 Tactical, success guarantees nothing.
01:45:01.82 --> 01:45:04.62 When Colonel Harry Summers allegedly told
01:45:04.62 --> 01:45:07.58 the North Vietnamese counterpart in 1975,
01:45:07.58 --> 01:45:10.78 that quote, you know you never defeated us
01:45:10.78 --> 01:45:11.94 on the battlefield.
01:45:13.22 --> 01:45:17.30 And quote, the reply supposedly was quote,
01:45:17.30 --> 01:45:22.30 that may be so, but it is also irrelevant and quote,
01:45:24.18 --> 01:45:26.62 military actions by themselves cannot achieve
01:45:26.62 --> 01:45:28.38 a success in coin.
01:45:28.38 --> 01:45:31.22 Tactical actions must not only be linked
01:45:31.22 --> 01:45:34.42 to the operational and strategic military objectives,
01:45:34.42 --> 01:45:39.42 but also to the essential political goals of coin.
01:45:41.90 --> 01:45:44.46 Tactical success guarantees nothing.
01:45:44.46 --> 01:45:47.30 As a matter of fact, it's irrelevant
01:45:47.30 --> 01:45:51.22 in court, in courting to this North Vietnamese kernel.
01:45:54.94 --> 01:45:58.78 Last one, most of the important decisions
01:45:58.78 --> 01:46:00.62 are not made by generals.
01:46:04.30 --> 01:46:08.66 It's the competence and judgment of soldiers and marines
01:46:08.66 --> 01:46:09.70 at all levels.
01:46:09.70 --> 01:46:12.78 Senior leaders must set the proper tone for actions
01:46:12.78 --> 01:46:15.50 by their organizations with thorough training
01:46:15.50 --> 01:46:17.70 and clear guidance and then trust.
01:46:17.70 --> 01:46:19.74 Their subordinates to do the right thing.
01:46:20.82 --> 01:46:23.34 Preparation for the tactical level leaders
01:46:23.34 --> 01:46:25.50 requires more than service doctrine.
01:46:25.50 --> 01:46:27.90 They must also be trained and educated
01:46:27.90 --> 01:46:30.38 to adapt their local situations.
01:46:30.38 --> 01:46:32.38 Understand the legal and ethical implications
01:46:32.38 --> 01:46:34.50 of their actions and exercise subordinates initiative
01:46:34.50 --> 01:46:38.02 and sound judgment to meet their senior commanders in tent.
01:46:38.02 --> 01:46:40.66 You at a company in an organization
01:46:40.66 --> 01:46:45.14 as the CEO, as the CEO, as the president,
01:46:45.14 --> 01:46:47.78 as the guy in charge.
01:46:49.46 --> 01:46:52.78 Most of the important decisions are not made by you.
01:46:52.78 --> 01:46:54.50 They may buy someone out there on the front line,
01:46:54.50 --> 01:46:56.54 so better lead them correctly.
01:47:01.78 --> 01:47:04.66 Little section on successful practices
01:47:04.66 --> 01:47:09.66 and unsuccessful practices.
01:47:11.66 --> 01:47:14.26 I'll read some of the unsuccessful practices.
01:47:14.26 --> 01:47:16.66 Place priority on killing and capturing the enemy
01:47:16.66 --> 01:47:18.66 not on engaging the population.
01:47:18.66 --> 01:47:19.66 What does that mean?
01:47:19.66 --> 01:47:22.26 That means when you have a problem inside your team
01:47:22.26 --> 01:47:25.66 and all you do is attack like whoever you think is doing it,
01:47:25.66 --> 01:47:29.66 that's where your priority is instead of building relationships
01:47:29.66 --> 01:47:31.66 with the group, you're wrong.
01:47:31.66 --> 01:47:36.66 So when you're a little kid and someone,
01:47:38.66 --> 01:47:40.66 I don't know, broke the water heater
01:47:40.66 --> 01:47:43.66 and no one wants to mess up.
01:47:43.66 --> 01:47:46.66 So when your dad comes and says,
01:47:46.66 --> 01:47:50.66 someone tell me or it's your, you'll all get punished
01:47:50.66 --> 01:47:53.66 is that sort of the same thing like you should do that?
01:47:53.66 --> 01:47:57.66 That's collective punishing and I don't really agree
01:47:57.66 --> 01:47:59.66 with collective punishing.
01:47:59.66 --> 01:48:01.66 There are times where it's used for instance
01:48:01.66 --> 01:48:04.66 in team building exercises like seal training.
01:48:04.66 --> 01:48:06.66 Oh, you're gonna get that all day long.
01:48:06.66 --> 01:48:08.66 Oh yeah, one person makes a mistake,
01:48:08.66 --> 01:48:09.66 they're gonna make everyone pay
01:48:09.66 --> 01:48:12.66 and they're doing that actually to create some sort of friction.
01:48:12.66 --> 01:48:13.66 Right?
01:48:13.66 --> 01:48:14.66 What's wrong with you?
01:48:14.66 --> 01:48:15.66 I got out.
01:48:15.66 --> 01:48:17.66 Keep your head under the boat.
01:48:17.66 --> 01:48:20.66 We're gonna keep doing this until Charles gets his head under the boat.
01:48:20.66 --> 01:48:21.66 Really?
01:48:21.66 --> 01:48:22.66 I got out right now.
01:48:22.66 --> 01:48:26.66 Yeah, it's kind of like a two little pronged effect.
01:48:26.66 --> 01:48:28.66 One, you want to put more heat on that guy
01:48:28.66 --> 01:48:30.66 because like letting the team down.
01:48:30.66 --> 01:48:33.66 A lot of times it's more punishment than letting yourself down,
01:48:33.66 --> 01:48:35.66 especially when they're all right there.
01:48:35.66 --> 01:48:39.66 And then the other part is yeah, that friction.
01:48:39.66 --> 01:48:41.66 Then put some stress on everybody.
01:48:41.66 --> 01:48:42.66 You should try to get him.
01:48:42.66 --> 01:48:43.66 You should do it.
01:48:43.66 --> 01:48:46.66 I remember in football, there's like, okay,
01:48:46.66 --> 01:48:48.66 so you know when you, okay, in football,
01:48:48.66 --> 01:48:51.66 you say, you know, you say what's called a cadence,
01:48:51.66 --> 01:48:54.66 you say set down hot or go or whatever,
01:48:54.66 --> 01:48:56.66 the quarterback says it whatever.
01:48:56.66 --> 01:49:00.66 If you jump, if you start before the actual count,
01:49:00.66 --> 01:49:02.66 you know, you call for false or false or false or false.
01:49:02.66 --> 01:49:04.66 I'll decide, yeah, depending on office defense,
01:49:04.66 --> 01:49:06.66 you know, people call different things sometimes.
01:49:06.66 --> 01:49:12.66 So anyway, there are certain drills like to drill that in your head.
01:49:12.66 --> 01:49:15.66 And it's always, it's like an ongoing drill anyway.
01:49:15.66 --> 01:49:18.66 So if, so if we're gonna do like some conditioning or something,
01:49:18.66 --> 01:49:20.66 it'll be in the conditioning.
01:49:20.66 --> 01:49:22.66 So everyone will line up, let's hit windspirants.
01:49:22.66 --> 01:49:25.66 So it'll be like, okay, the count is on three.
01:49:25.66 --> 01:49:29.66 So they'll set down hot, hot, hot, hot on the third, hot, they go.
01:49:29.66 --> 01:49:31.66 Some people still jump off sides during the conditioning.
01:49:31.66 --> 01:49:34.66 So I'm saying it's like a drill that constantly goes.
01:49:34.66 --> 01:49:39.66 So if one guy jumps off sides, everybody pays for it.
01:49:39.66 --> 01:49:43.66 And sometimes the guy who'll jump off sides doesn't pay for it.
01:49:43.66 --> 01:49:46.66 So basically, you just go ahead and sit down.
01:49:46.66 --> 01:49:49.66 Yeah, or basically in a windspirant situation,
01:49:49.66 --> 01:49:51.66 the common thing in our situation would be like,
01:49:51.66 --> 01:49:53.66 okay, let's say it's a 50-yard windspirant, right?
01:49:53.66 --> 01:49:57.66 And you start at the zero yard line and you run to the 50 or whatever.
01:49:57.66 --> 01:50:02.66 So it's the counts on two, set down hot, one guy jumps off side.
01:50:02.66 --> 01:50:04.66 Echo jumps off side.
01:50:04.66 --> 01:50:08.66 Echo stays there, everyone else goes five yards back.
01:50:08.66 --> 01:50:12.66 So now they have the 55-yard windspirant, I don't have the 50.
01:50:12.66 --> 01:50:15.66 I do it again, they go five yards back again, seems same.
01:50:15.66 --> 01:50:19.66 So it like, it puts blame or pressure on you to get it, right?
01:50:19.66 --> 01:50:21.66 So you do learn, I think,
01:50:21.66 --> 01:50:24.66 but some people can get into this weird downward spiral
01:50:24.66 --> 01:50:27.66 because they're so stressed about everyone mad at them now.
01:50:27.66 --> 01:50:29.66 So they don't even think.
01:50:29.66 --> 01:50:32.66 So they can't get their act together, it's funny.
01:50:32.66 --> 01:50:34.66 But it's a good way to create stress.
01:50:34.66 --> 01:50:35.66 Yeah.
01:50:35.66 --> 01:50:40.66 Some of the successful practices, the other unsuccessful practices
01:50:40.66 --> 01:50:45.66 are very military-based conduct-betarian-sized operations
01:50:45.66 --> 01:50:48.66 as the norm, that's too big, concentrate-military forces
01:50:48.66 --> 01:50:51.66 in large bases for protection, we know that that's not going to work.
01:50:51.66 --> 01:50:55.66 Focus special operations forces primarily on raiding,
01:50:55.66 --> 01:50:57.66 like, hey, we're going to go capture kill bad guys.
01:50:57.66 --> 01:51:00.66 That's not where you want to put the focus.
01:51:00.66 --> 01:51:04.66 You can do it for sure, but it can't be the focus.
01:51:04.66 --> 01:51:08.66 So then the some of the successful practices are
01:51:08.66 --> 01:51:11.66 emphasizing intelligence focused on the population,
01:51:11.66 --> 01:51:14.66 their needs and security.
01:51:14.66 --> 01:51:19.66 Focus on the population, focus on the people.
01:51:19.66 --> 01:51:22.66 Expand established and expand security areas,
01:51:22.66 --> 01:51:25.66 isolated surgeons from the population.
01:51:25.66 --> 01:51:29.66 So those are the kind of things that help out place police
01:51:29.66 --> 01:51:32.66 and the lead with military support.
01:51:32.66 --> 01:51:34.66 We absolutely tried to do that.
01:51:34.66 --> 01:51:36.66 We put the Iraqis, we brought the Iraqis with us.
01:51:36.66 --> 01:51:38.66 We put them in the lead.
01:51:38.66 --> 01:51:43.66 So those are some solid successful practices.
01:51:43.66 --> 01:51:46.66 And here's the summary from this first chapter.
01:51:46.66 --> 01:51:49.66 Counter-insurgency is an extremely complex form of warfare.
01:51:49.66 --> 01:51:52.66 Truly war at the graduate level at its core.
01:51:52.66 --> 01:51:56.66 Counter-insurgency war figures a struggle for the support of the population.
01:51:56.66 --> 01:52:01.66 Their protection and welfare is the center of gravity of friendly forces.
01:52:01.66 --> 01:52:05.66 And the decisive terrain.
01:52:05.66 --> 01:52:07.66 This is something that I stole.
01:52:07.66 --> 01:52:11.66 I think this is the third big thing that I stole from this
01:52:11.66 --> 01:52:17.66 to start selling counter-insurgency up my chain of command.
01:52:17.66 --> 01:52:20.66 Was this idea that the center of gravity.
01:52:20.66 --> 01:52:26.66 The decisive terrain in this fight was not an airfield.
01:52:26.66 --> 01:52:27.66 It wasn't a part of town.
01:52:27.66 --> 01:52:29.66 It was the people.
01:52:29.66 --> 01:52:34.66 If we got the people, like when you storm a beach,
01:52:34.66 --> 01:52:37.66 when you get the beach head, you know, you want to get a foothold.
01:52:37.66 --> 01:52:39.66 That's the decisive terrain.
01:52:39.66 --> 01:52:42.66 If you're taking an island, you want to get the high ground.
01:52:42.66 --> 01:52:44.66 Here, it wasn't the high ground.
01:52:44.66 --> 01:52:47.66 It wasn't the beach head.
01:52:47.66 --> 01:52:49.66 It wasn't the airfield.
01:52:49.66 --> 01:52:51.66 It was the people.
01:52:51.66 --> 01:52:55.66 Gaining and maintaining that support is a formidable challenge.
01:52:55.66 --> 01:53:05.66 There are a host of non-military agencies who efforts must be synchronized and coordinated with those of military to achieve these aims.
01:53:05.66 --> 01:53:09.66 And this thing closes out.
01:53:09.66 --> 01:53:17.66 Insurgence are also fighting for the support of the population but are constrained by neither the law of war nor the bounds of human decency.
01:53:17.66 --> 01:53:23.66 They do anything to preserve their greatest advantage, the ability to hide among the people.
01:53:23.66 --> 01:53:29.66 These amoral enemies survive by their wits constantly adapting to the situation.
01:53:29.66 --> 01:53:34.66 To defeat them, it is essential that counter-insurgent forces develop.
01:53:34.66 --> 01:53:44.66 The ability to learn and adapt rapidly and continuously.
01:53:44.66 --> 01:53:53.66 So, learn and adapt rapidly and continuously.
01:53:53.66 --> 01:54:01.66 It seems to be a common theme here on this podcast in the books that we review in the people that we talk to in the lessons that we learn.
01:54:01.66 --> 01:54:06.66 We seem to hear it over and over and over again.
01:54:06.66 --> 01:54:14.66 That's one of the primary and most important attributes of winning.
01:54:14.66 --> 01:54:24.66 So, I think it's pretty clear that you need to take lessons like this and if you can learn to apply them.
01:54:24.66 --> 01:54:27.66 You can't universally apply them, right?
01:54:27.66 --> 01:54:31.66 And it says in the book, it says you can't just universally apply these things.
01:54:31.66 --> 01:54:35.66 You always have to be smart enough to pay attention to run a feedback loop.
01:54:35.66 --> 01:54:38.66 See what's actually happening and adjust.
01:54:38.66 --> 01:54:48.66 And you can only do that by the way if you're humble enough to actually listen to the feedback loop.
01:54:48.66 --> 01:54:54.66 Everything is related. Everything is connected.
01:54:54.66 --> 01:55:10.66 And you can overlay these things into whatever part of your life you need to counter whatever insurgency that you're facing.
01:55:10.66 --> 01:55:23.66 Whether you're on the battlefield, whether you're in business, you're a leader, you're facing an insurgency in your own family.
01:55:23.66 --> 01:55:36.66 And we also have to pay attention to the fact that we might have an insurgency going on inside of us and insurgency of weakness.
01:55:36.66 --> 01:55:38.66 And slough!
01:55:38.66 --> 01:55:42.66 Trying to bring us down. Eccletrails.
01:55:42.66 --> 01:55:43.66 Yes sir.
01:55:43.66 --> 01:55:51.66 Do you have any recommendations how we could fight the internal insurgency that we are facing every single day?
01:55:51.66 --> 01:55:54.66 So it's there. 100% there.
01:55:54.66 --> 01:55:59.66 When you've got to work out planned.
01:55:59.66 --> 01:56:03.66 And then boom, you feel the battle going on inside.
01:56:03.66 --> 01:56:06.66 All the reasons why today should actually, you know what?
01:56:06.66 --> 01:56:08.66 Think about it. Today should be a rest day.
01:56:08.66 --> 01:56:10.66 That's the one side.
01:56:10.66 --> 01:56:11.66 The other side is like nope.
01:56:11.66 --> 01:56:12.66 Shouldn't be a rest day.
01:56:12.66 --> 01:56:14.66 In fact, you're weak right now.
01:56:14.66 --> 01:56:16.66 And let's get stronger.
01:56:16.66 --> 01:56:18.66 Let's push this a lot of physical benefits.
01:56:18.66 --> 01:56:24.66 If you overcome this feeling of not wanting to do the workout and you do it anyway, that's even now you're getting stronger mentally too.
01:56:24.66 --> 01:56:28.66 And you know, but meanwhile it's like boom, it's a little battle.
01:56:28.66 --> 01:56:32.66 The other side is like, but you got all that other stuff you could be doing that you need to do.
01:56:32.66 --> 01:56:33.66 You got this stuff to do.
01:56:33.66 --> 01:56:35.66 If you get that done, boom, you'll be way better off.
01:56:35.66 --> 01:56:37.66 I'm just saying you'll get some recovery.
01:56:37.66 --> 01:56:39.66 And you know, so it's like too battles going on.
01:56:39.66 --> 01:56:40.66 Insurgency in there.
01:56:40.66 --> 01:56:41.66 Oh yeah.
01:56:41.66 --> 01:56:42.66 And there.
01:56:42.66 --> 01:56:43.66 And it's like that.
01:56:43.66 --> 01:56:46.66 When you said that the insurgency in the inside, it's that.
01:56:46.66 --> 01:56:49.66 It's the weak part of it's not going to be before.
01:56:49.66 --> 01:56:50.66 Go ahead.
01:56:50.66 --> 01:56:51.66 Go ahead.
01:56:51.66 --> 01:56:53.66 Let the cat out of the bag right there.
01:56:53.66 --> 01:56:55.66 So if I'm working on something, right?
01:56:55.66 --> 01:56:56.66 Whatever it may be.
01:56:56.66 --> 01:56:58.66 And it's time for the workout or whatever.
01:56:58.66 --> 01:57:01.66 Like that part of me would be like, oh, it just do it tomorrow.
01:57:01.66 --> 01:57:08.66 Do the workout tomorrow because look, you got all this thing that you're in the middle of getting that done is actually better right now.
01:57:08.66 --> 01:57:10.66 Where it's beneficial.
01:57:10.66 --> 01:57:15.66 You know, that insurgency is trying to win the heart and mind of my whole actions.
01:57:15.66 --> 01:57:24.66 Seems like showing me the benefits, you know, of like skipping the workout, but that's kind of evil in a way, you know.
01:57:24.66 --> 01:57:27.66 But yeah, we got to fight against that anyway.
01:57:27.66 --> 01:57:28.66 So yes.
01:57:28.66 --> 01:57:29.66 So what are we doing?
01:57:29.66 --> 01:57:30.66 Well, we're working out.
01:57:30.66 --> 01:57:31.66 Yeah, for sure.
01:57:31.66 --> 01:57:32.66 Don't skip the workout.
01:57:32.66 --> 01:57:34.66 Don't skip your injured skip the workout.
01:57:34.66 --> 01:57:35.66 Today was today.
01:57:35.66 --> 01:57:36.66 This very day.
01:57:36.66 --> 01:57:37.66 Sure.
01:57:37.66 --> 01:57:41.66 I know looking at my weak ahead because what is today of the week.
01:57:41.66 --> 01:57:43.66 It is Saturday right now.
01:57:43.66 --> 01:57:44.66 Yes.
01:57:44.66 --> 01:57:48.66 So I looked at the week ahead and looked at tomorrow.
01:57:48.66 --> 01:57:52.66 I'm pretty booked up tomorrow and the whole week is kind of crazy.
01:57:52.66 --> 01:57:56.66 And I know that we needed to get this done.
01:57:56.66 --> 01:58:01.66 So my first thing, you know, I always wake up at a good morning workout, but I knew I had a priori
01:58:01.66 --> 01:58:02.66 to exercise this.
01:58:02.66 --> 01:58:04.66 And I actually got it done pretty quick.
01:58:04.66 --> 01:58:05.66 I had already read it.
01:58:05.66 --> 01:58:07.66 So now I was going through making notes and whatever.
01:58:07.66 --> 01:58:12.66 And I, but I woke up and did that first before the workout before the workout.
01:58:12.66 --> 01:58:14.66 Because I had to prioritize next few years.
01:58:14.66 --> 01:58:22.66 So now it's like, you know, I spent like three or four hours finishing the reading,
01:58:22.66 --> 01:58:26.66 looking a couple things up and then I was going through, you know, highlighting.
01:58:26.66 --> 01:58:30.66 So now it's like 10 30 or something like that.
01:58:30.66 --> 01:58:35.66 I had a little food and I had all kinds of excuses.
01:58:35.66 --> 01:58:36.66 I locked and loaded.
01:58:36.66 --> 01:58:37.66 So that's got to be eat.
01:58:37.66 --> 01:58:38.66 That's.
01:58:38.66 --> 01:58:39.66 Yeah.
01:58:39.66 --> 01:58:43.66 So what I did was you had a little insurance.
01:58:43.66 --> 01:58:44.66 You going on.
01:58:44.66 --> 01:58:45.66 Yeah.
01:58:45.66 --> 01:58:49.66 And then I just texted you and said, hey, one of Clark, let's do it.
01:58:49.66 --> 01:58:53.66 And I said, as soon as it's, if he, he's, I don't care if he responds,
01:58:53.66 --> 01:58:57.66 I'm just going to get after it before I eat a like legitimate food.
01:58:57.66 --> 01:58:58.66 Yeah.
01:58:58.66 --> 01:58:59.66 Wait, get up.
01:58:59.66 --> 01:59:00.66 That's a little workout.
01:59:00.66 --> 01:59:01.66 Yeah, just went knocked out of workout.
01:59:01.66 --> 01:59:02.66 Yeah.
01:59:02.66 --> 01:59:06.66 Just did sort of a combo workout took me 40 minutes.
01:59:06.66 --> 01:59:07.66 You know what I'm saying?
01:59:07.66 --> 01:59:09.66 Still solid.
01:59:09.66 --> 01:59:10.66 But just had to get it done.
01:59:10.66 --> 01:59:11.66 You know, had to get it done.
01:59:11.66 --> 01:59:12.66 Had to overcome that.
01:59:12.66 --> 01:59:14.66 But in search and see situations.
01:59:14.66 --> 01:59:17.66 Sometimes those insurgents can make good points.
01:59:17.66 --> 01:59:18.66 They do.
01:59:18.66 --> 01:59:19.66 They know what they're doing.
01:59:19.66 --> 01:59:20.66 Yeah.
01:59:20.66 --> 01:59:21.66 They absolutely know what they're doing.
01:59:21.66 --> 01:59:23.66 That's why you got to be able to counter them.
01:59:23.66 --> 01:59:25.66 Um, man, I was thinking this.
01:59:25.66 --> 01:59:26.66 Let's face it.
01:59:26.66 --> 01:59:28.66 In search and see are successful.
01:59:28.66 --> 01:59:29.66 Often.
01:59:29.66 --> 01:59:30.66 Yeah.
01:59:30.66 --> 01:59:32.66 They're not, if you don't know how to counter it.
01:59:32.66 --> 01:59:33.66 You're going to be in trouble.
01:59:33.66 --> 01:59:34.66 Big time.
01:59:34.66 --> 01:59:35.66 What?
01:59:35.66 --> 01:59:38.66 I was yesterday when I was working out the same way.
01:59:38.66 --> 01:59:41.66 You were that one time you're teasing me about squats or whatever.
01:59:41.66 --> 01:59:43.66 You were like, oh, I wonder if it was Scott.
01:59:43.66 --> 01:59:44.66 Remember you're saying that?
01:59:44.66 --> 01:59:45.66 Okay.
01:59:45.66 --> 01:59:48.66 So I was kind of the same inverse reverse whatever scenario where I was like,
01:59:48.66 --> 01:59:50.66 I wonder if Jockel could do this workout.
01:59:50.66 --> 01:59:52.66 Like what if me and Jockel traded workouts?
01:59:52.66 --> 01:59:53.66 Whatever given day.
01:59:53.66 --> 01:59:56.66 And we had to do the same workout.
01:59:56.66 --> 01:59:58.66 Same weight.
01:59:58.66 --> 01:59:59.66 Everything.
01:59:59.66 --> 02:00:00.66 If you can't do it.
02:00:00.66 --> 02:00:01.66 Oh, there's an indicator.
02:00:01.66 --> 02:00:02.66 You can't do it.
02:00:02.66 --> 02:00:03.66 Kind of thing.
02:00:03.66 --> 02:00:04.66 Right.
02:00:04.66 --> 02:00:06.66 If you can't do it, it's an indicator that you can't do it.
02:00:06.66 --> 02:00:08.66 I don't say that.
02:00:08.66 --> 02:00:11.66 I'm saying that's the purpose of trading workouts.
02:00:11.66 --> 02:00:14.66 You know, like you always wonder like, I wonder if I could do that guy's workout.
02:00:14.66 --> 02:00:17.66 I wonder if I could do the, you know, that football players workout, whatever.
02:00:17.66 --> 02:00:19.66 You know, you kind of wonder that everyone's in a while.
02:00:19.66 --> 02:00:21.66 So especially when you see guys working out hard,
02:00:21.66 --> 02:00:24.66 I come under, I think, you know, with these crossfit guys or whatever.
02:00:24.66 --> 02:00:25.66 So that's what I was thinking.
02:00:25.66 --> 02:00:29.66 I was like, I wonder if I, I wonder how I would fare with Jockel's workout.
02:00:29.66 --> 02:00:33.66 Because there's two kind of kinds of like road blocks if you will.
02:00:33.66 --> 02:00:37.66 One is like, if I just can't do the weight, like, let's say your squat is just,
02:00:37.66 --> 02:00:38.66 it's a bigger squat than me.
02:00:38.66 --> 02:00:43.66 You know, so if you got freaking a set of 20, a set of 15, a set of nine and a set of,
02:00:43.66 --> 02:00:45.66 however that goes.
02:00:45.66 --> 02:00:50.66 And you're, again, I got to use your same weight and I simply can't get 20 reps with that weight.
02:00:50.66 --> 02:00:52.66 I just physically can't do it.
02:00:52.66 --> 02:00:53.66 This kind of, okay, there's that.
02:00:53.66 --> 02:00:54.66 That's one.
02:00:54.66 --> 02:00:57.66 Then the other one is like, this is like, I got to tap out.
02:00:57.66 --> 02:00:58.66 This is too hard for me.
02:00:58.66 --> 02:01:01.66 I got to rest more or I got to like, not do 10 sets.
02:01:01.66 --> 02:01:03.66 I can only do like five or whatever.
02:01:03.66 --> 02:01:04.66 You can do it the same.
02:01:04.66 --> 02:01:05.66 There's that too.
02:01:05.66 --> 02:01:12.66 So both of those, and probably there's other stuff too, is like, you wonder, how would I fare in that exact workout?
02:01:12.66 --> 02:01:14.66 Same, you know, weight.
02:01:14.66 --> 02:01:18.66 Like we're, now we're similar weight as far as body weight or whatever.
02:01:18.66 --> 02:01:22.66 So it's like I was wondering that like I wonder if, then I was like,
02:01:22.66 --> 02:01:27.66 first I was wondering, I wonder if I could do Jockel's and I was, then I was thinking, I wonder if he could do mine?
02:01:27.66 --> 02:01:29.66 I don't think I could do yours.
02:01:29.66 --> 02:01:37.66 I think that there's be a venn diagram, whether it be an overlap in the middle where we could both do each other's workouts.
02:01:37.66 --> 02:01:42.66 Then I have some workouts that you wouldn't be able to do, and you have some workouts that I wouldn't be able to do.
02:01:42.66 --> 02:01:46.66 Because of our specialties, right?
02:01:46.66 --> 02:01:47.66 Yeah.
02:01:47.66 --> 02:01:51.66 The metcons, I feel like, I don't know.
02:01:51.66 --> 02:01:53.66 Because yours are more extended, right?
02:01:53.66 --> 02:01:55.66 You're metcons?
02:01:55.66 --> 02:01:56.66 They're probably like what?
02:01:56.66 --> 02:01:58.66 15, 20 minutes or something?
02:01:58.66 --> 02:01:59.66 Yeah.
02:01:59.66 --> 02:02:00.66 More more?
02:02:00.66 --> 02:02:01.66 Yeah, I see.
02:02:01.66 --> 02:02:03.66 So, but they're going to be less intense though.
02:02:03.66 --> 02:02:04.66 Depends.
02:02:04.66 --> 02:02:05.66 Whatever.
02:02:05.66 --> 02:02:10.66 None of the less I was wondering that.
02:02:10.66 --> 02:02:12.66 So maybe one day we're going to see.
02:02:12.66 --> 02:02:14.66 We should straight out have the workout.
02:02:14.66 --> 02:02:16.66 I've respirit built into my workout.
02:02:16.66 --> 02:02:21.66 That's one thing is yours seems more structured.
02:02:21.66 --> 02:02:27.66 You know, I guess not really, because I, but I just basically, I don't have respirit.
02:02:27.66 --> 02:02:29.66 Generally, most of my workouts don't have a rest.
02:02:29.66 --> 02:02:31.66 Like a time where you're like three minutes of rest.
02:02:31.66 --> 02:02:33.66 I don't generally have that.
02:02:33.66 --> 02:02:34.66 Yeah.
02:02:34.66 --> 02:02:35.66 Yeah, I do.
02:02:35.66 --> 02:02:37.66 Because we're all beginning to some other exercise during that period.
02:02:37.66 --> 02:02:40.66 Yeah, which is yet another type of workout.
02:02:40.66 --> 02:02:42.66 You know, like stimulus free.
02:02:42.66 --> 02:02:44.66 Because let's say you're just, let's go, okay, let's go, basic example.
02:02:44.66 --> 02:02:49.66 If you go, you know, five sets of 12, we'll just say.
02:02:49.66 --> 02:02:50.66 Right?
02:02:50.66 --> 02:02:56.66 There's a huge difference with not only the weight you can do, but just over a what you're doing to your body for that workout.
02:02:56.66 --> 02:03:04.66 If you go one minute rest in between those sets and three minutes rest in between those sets, you're doing like essentially you're doing two different things to your body.
02:03:04.66 --> 02:03:04.66 Yeah.
02:03:04.66 --> 02:03:10.66 You know, so it's like, all right, which workout am I doing then that's what that's why rest is kind of set in there.
02:03:10.66 --> 02:03:18.66 But then if there's no rest in between the sets and you program it like, oh, I need to get 500 pull ups.
02:03:18.66 --> 02:03:20.66 I don't care how I get them.
02:03:20.66 --> 02:03:21.66 I just gotta get them.
02:03:21.66 --> 02:03:25.66 I don't know what's not to say, can I guess or whatever or just you just gotta get 500 pull ups.
02:03:25.66 --> 02:03:38.66 It's kind of that's part of the workout too, you know, so it's like it's almost like it's you're doing a specific thing to your body there too, you know, so it's like that fits, you know, you don't have to have rest periods.
02:03:38.66 --> 02:03:41.66 I program them in for a reason.
02:03:41.66 --> 02:03:46.66 Yeah, no, you have a specific purpose, but nonetheless.
02:03:46.66 --> 02:03:49.66 Oh yeah, all right, no, no, the last I forgot.
02:03:49.66 --> 02:03:52.66 Yeah, someone to tell people how we can stay on the path.
02:03:52.66 --> 02:03:59.66 Yeah, effectively healthy and you know, effectively and healthy.
02:03:59.66 --> 02:04:03.66 Anyway, yes, so when you're working out, you can need need fuel, eat good.
02:04:03.66 --> 02:04:08.66 80, 20 is good, 80% clean, 20% freedom.
02:04:08.66 --> 02:04:10.66 80% discipline, 20% freedom.
02:04:10.66 --> 02:04:11.66 Yeah, interesting.
02:04:11.66 --> 02:04:13.66 Well, that's recommended.
02:04:13.66 --> 02:04:17.66 You can go 910, you start going 70, 30, then you, that's a slippery slope.
02:04:17.66 --> 02:04:18.66 That's what I think.
02:04:18.66 --> 02:04:24.66 Nonetheless, you want supplementation for your joints, for your brain, for even protein supplements,
02:04:24.66 --> 02:04:28.66 but when you got you jockel fuel supplements, joint warfare, or rejoin to obviously
02:04:28.66 --> 02:04:34.66 krill oil, make a 3's all day and antioxidants by the way.
02:04:34.66 --> 02:04:37.66 Also discipline and discipline go, which is essentially the same thing.
02:04:37.66 --> 02:04:40.66 Different delivery systems.
02:04:40.66 --> 02:04:43.66 Cance and powders.
02:04:43.66 --> 02:04:44.66 It's true.
02:04:44.66 --> 02:04:49.66 And it can pills.
02:04:49.66 --> 02:04:53.66 Because I told, I told B little at the beginning.
02:04:53.66 --> 02:04:54.66 So we started making discipline.
02:04:54.66 --> 02:04:56.66 I said, hey man, this is really good stuff.
02:04:56.66 --> 02:05:00.66 Yeah, this is exactly what I, this is what we want, right?
02:05:00.66 --> 02:05:01.66 Yes.
02:05:01.66 --> 02:05:06.66 I said, but I, I talk for a long period of time for living.
02:05:06.66 --> 02:05:13.66 And if I have to drink this to get my, get that hitter,
02:05:13.66 --> 02:05:17.66 if I have to drink this before I go out and start talking.
02:05:17.66 --> 02:05:19.66 And then all of a sudden, I got to go to the bathroom.
02:05:19.66 --> 02:05:20.66 I said, I need a pill.
02:05:20.66 --> 02:05:21.66 I told him.
02:05:21.66 --> 02:05:22.66 I said, I said, put this stuff in a pill.
02:05:22.66 --> 02:05:25.66 He goes, okay, and he made, what is it called?
02:05:25.66 --> 02:05:30.66 It's a compressed, not a capsule, but like a compressed thing, whatever.
02:05:30.66 --> 02:05:32.66 And I don't really like those.
02:05:32.66 --> 02:05:33.66 Oh, for real?
02:05:33.66 --> 02:05:34.66 So then I had to get him back.
02:05:34.66 --> 02:05:35.66 Let him go.
02:05:35.66 --> 02:05:36.66 So it broke.
02:05:36.66 --> 02:05:38.66 And he goes, he said, you said, you said, pill.
02:05:38.66 --> 02:05:41.66 And I said, I thought the, a capsule was a pill.
02:05:41.66 --> 02:05:44.66 To me, that's the same thing. You take a pill, right?
02:05:44.66 --> 02:05:47.66 I didn't know that a pill was a, whatever that compressed thing is.
02:05:47.66 --> 02:05:49.66 And a capsule was something different.
02:05:49.66 --> 02:05:49.66 Yes.
02:05:49.66 --> 02:05:53.66 But if you need that little, like, you need it.
02:05:53.66 --> 02:05:55.66 Boom, you can take a, the capsule.
02:05:55.66 --> 02:06:00.66 A capsule, a disciplined pill, not a gel cap, which actually this stem from.
02:06:00.66 --> 02:06:04.66 So, I forget what happened in the world,
02:06:04.66 --> 02:06:10.66 but there was controversy about veterans and drugs.
02:06:10.66 --> 02:06:11.66 And drugs.
02:06:11.66 --> 02:06:16.66 And someone was saying something like, you know, what do you expect to happen when
02:06:16.66 --> 02:06:20.66 these put all these vets on drugs, put on, and fedemines?
02:06:20.66 --> 02:06:23.66 And I said, I said, we're not on a fedemines and he goes,
02:06:23.66 --> 02:06:25.66 Prylets take him, fedemines.
02:06:25.66 --> 02:06:30.66 And I said, I texted Dave Burke.
02:06:30.66 --> 02:06:31.66 Yeah, good deal to you.
02:06:31.66 --> 02:06:32.66 Yeah.
02:06:32.66 --> 02:06:36.66 And I said, I said, do they give you guys and fedemines to take?
02:06:36.66 --> 02:06:37.66 And he goes, no.
02:06:37.66 --> 02:06:40.66 I mean, this is all of within, this is on Twitter.
02:06:40.66 --> 02:06:42.66 This is probably two years ago.
02:06:42.66 --> 02:06:43.66 He goes, no.
02:06:43.66 --> 02:06:46.66 And so I go back to the guy, I go, no, they never give pilots and fedemines.
02:06:46.66 --> 02:06:47.66 And then I get it.
02:06:47.66 --> 02:06:50.66 And as soon as I tweeted that, Dave Burke.
02:06:50.66 --> 02:06:51.66 Good deal to you.
02:06:51.66 --> 02:06:53.66 Yeah, he goes back to you as pro.
02:06:53.66 --> 02:06:54.66 I just screwed you.
02:06:54.66 --> 02:06:56.66 He said, he's like, bro, I just screwed you.
02:06:56.66 --> 02:06:57.66 And I was like, what?
02:06:57.66 --> 02:06:59.66 He goes, he goes, they definitely give it to us tonight.
02:06:59.66 --> 02:07:02.66 And I was like, and I, I was like, Roger.
02:07:02.66 --> 02:07:04.66 I said, hey, what's, I was wrong.
02:07:04.66 --> 02:07:05.66 But guess what they call him?
02:07:05.66 --> 02:07:07.66 What?
02:07:07.66 --> 02:07:08.66 Go pills.
02:07:08.66 --> 02:07:09.66 Okay.
02:07:09.66 --> 02:07:11.66 So that's what I was saying to be little.
02:07:11.66 --> 02:07:14.66 I'll just say, hey, man, we need go pills.
02:07:14.66 --> 02:07:19.66 No, we don't need, and fedemines in the, in fact, we do not want and fedemines.
02:07:19.66 --> 02:07:24.66 But we do want the feeling that discipline and the, the, the, the
02:07:24.66 --> 02:07:27.66 Discipline powder gives you a little cognitive kick.
02:07:27.66 --> 02:07:29.66 Yeah, little, little get up and go.
02:07:29.66 --> 02:07:30.66 Yes.
02:07:30.66 --> 02:07:31.66 That's why we call it this one.
02:07:31.66 --> 02:07:32.66 Go.
02:07:32.66 --> 02:07:33.66 Anyway, there you go.
02:07:33.66 --> 02:07:34.66 That's a little information behind that.
02:07:34.66 --> 02:07:38.66 We got chocolate, we got milk, strawberry, chocolate for kids.
02:07:38.66 --> 02:07:40.66 We got mint, peanut butter, the whole nine yards.
02:07:40.66 --> 02:07:42.66 It's true.
02:07:42.66 --> 02:07:46.66 And all the stuff is available, the vitamin shop, or it's available at
02:07:46.66 --> 02:07:49.66 OrgeneMaine.com.
02:07:49.66 --> 02:07:53.66 You know, speaking of origin, main other things on there besides
02:07:53.66 --> 02:07:56.66 Chocolate field, like, geysin rashguards for a
02:07:56.66 --> 02:07:59.66 Gigi to one, we go back to Gigi to, if we haven't already.
02:07:59.66 --> 02:08:00.66 We're kind of getting back there.
02:08:00.66 --> 02:08:01.66 Boom.
02:08:01.66 --> 02:08:03.66 I think there's a, a underground mode.
02:08:03.66 --> 02:08:05.66 There's definitely people training.
02:08:05.66 --> 02:08:07.66 Yeah, that's JP training.
02:08:07.66 --> 02:08:08.66 Texas is open.
02:08:08.66 --> 02:08:09.66 Yeah.
02:08:09.66 --> 02:08:13.66 Yeah, there's, I think I heard a thing that gyms are opening,
02:08:13.66 --> 02:08:16.66 June 15th or something like this.
02:08:16.66 --> 02:08:18.66 They opened with a bunch of restrictions.
02:08:18.66 --> 02:08:19.66 Yeah.
02:08:19.66 --> 02:08:21.66 So yeah, but we're getting there.
02:08:21.66 --> 02:08:23.66 Yeah, coming out from the underground for sure.
02:08:23.66 --> 02:08:24.66 So you have to need a new Gigi.
02:08:24.66 --> 02:08:27.66 Yeah, origin Gigi best ones factually in the world, by the way.
02:08:27.66 --> 02:08:30.66 And fully in America, of course.
02:08:30.66 --> 02:08:33.66 Which is kind of important right now.
02:08:33.66 --> 02:08:38.66 You want to get your stuff that's made in America not made in China.
02:08:38.66 --> 02:08:42.66 Yeah, that's why I recommend it anyways.
02:08:42.66 --> 02:08:43.66 Okay.
02:08:43.66 --> 02:08:44.66 Don't forget about jeans.
02:08:44.66 --> 02:08:47.66 Don't forget about boots.
02:08:47.66 --> 02:08:54.66 Don't forget about t-shirts, hoodies, and don't forget about joggers.
02:08:54.66 --> 02:08:55.66 Unless you're me.
02:08:55.66 --> 02:08:56.66 If you me, don't get joggers.
02:08:56.66 --> 02:08:57.66 Yeah, just forget about it.
02:08:57.66 --> 02:08:58.66 Yeah, don't worry.
02:08:58.66 --> 02:09:08.66 There's a whole, a whole just, a whole can, there's a whole just plethora of reasons why
02:09:08.66 --> 02:09:11.66 if your name is Joko, don't get joggers.
02:09:11.66 --> 02:09:12.66 They just don't want it.
02:09:12.66 --> 02:09:13.66 Yeah, don't get it.
02:09:13.66 --> 02:09:14.66 Just don't get it.
02:09:14.66 --> 02:09:15.66 Don't put them on.
02:09:15.66 --> 02:09:16.66 Just if your name is echo Charles.
02:09:16.66 --> 02:09:17.66 Oh, oh, thank.
02:09:17.66 --> 02:09:18.66 All joggers.
02:09:18.66 --> 02:09:19.66 Oh, yes, sir.
02:09:19.66 --> 02:09:22.66 Yes, or do you mean dot com also.
02:09:22.66 --> 02:09:24.66 Joko is a store.
02:09:24.66 --> 02:09:26.66 That's called joko store.
02:09:26.66 --> 02:09:33.66 That's where you can get your shirts, custom shirts.
02:09:33.66 --> 02:09:38.66 Maybe you stretching that word custom for, but nonetheless, you can't represent this when
02:09:38.66 --> 02:09:39.66 you go to read them good.
02:09:39.66 --> 02:09:40.66 Take pie grunk.
02:09:40.66 --> 02:09:41.66 I don't take you.
02:09:41.66 --> 02:09:42.66 Get after it.
02:09:42.66 --> 02:09:43.66 It's a good one.
02:09:43.66 --> 02:09:48.66 Anyway, shirts that will represent on the path while you're on.
02:09:48.66 --> 02:09:49.66 The path.
02:09:49.66 --> 02:09:51.66 Anyway, it's a mess.
02:09:51.66 --> 02:09:52.66 I'm asking other cool stuff.
02:09:52.66 --> 02:09:55.66 So yeah, if you like something, get something.
02:09:55.66 --> 02:09:58.66 We have an email list.
02:09:58.66 --> 02:10:01.66 Here's the thing.
02:10:01.66 --> 02:10:09.66 I always feel kind of odd for lack of better term saying, hey, sign up on for our email list.
02:10:09.66 --> 02:10:11.66 It feels weird saying that.
02:10:11.66 --> 02:10:15.66 Well, that's because you have been conditioned in your life that every time somebody told you that
02:10:15.66 --> 02:10:18.66 and you did it, you got a bunch of junk.
02:10:18.66 --> 02:10:23.66 Yes, and I don't want to say spam necessarily, but yeah, it's one of these things where
02:10:23.66 --> 02:10:24.66 I'm down.
02:10:24.66 --> 02:10:26.66 I am down for the email list, 100%.
02:10:26.66 --> 02:10:30.66 If I'm like, oh, wait, I do want updates on this stuff right here.
02:10:30.66 --> 02:10:31.66 I'm down.
02:10:31.66 --> 02:10:34.66 I'm not conditioned necessarily against it, but here's the thing.
02:10:34.66 --> 02:10:39.66 I have felt the sting of signing up for the email list, hoping that I'll be updated
02:10:39.66 --> 02:10:43.66 with like new cool stuff that they offer or whatever, but meanwhile, they're sending me like,
02:10:43.66 --> 02:10:46.66 oh, happy Valentine's Day from XYZ.com.
02:10:46.66 --> 02:10:51.66 It's like, bro, I don't care, but you wishing me happy Valentine's Day in my email inbox.
02:10:51.66 --> 02:10:54.66 Which, let's face it, are email inbox for most of them.
02:10:54.66 --> 02:10:59.66 For some of us, we'll say, I think most of us, but whatever, are email inboxes kind of sacred,
02:10:59.66 --> 02:11:02.66 like, proud stay out of there if you don't have something to look at.
02:11:02.66 --> 02:11:04.66 That's the way it should be.
02:11:04.66 --> 02:11:05.66 Yeah.
02:11:05.66 --> 02:11:12.66 So anyway, my point there is if, if you sign up for this, if you're saying all this now, you're going to tell everyone that you sign up for the email.
02:11:12.66 --> 02:11:15.66 I'm not saying anyone should do anything, ever.
02:11:15.66 --> 02:11:19.66 Maybe not ever, but I'm not saying in this case, but I'm saying, we do have an email list.
02:11:19.66 --> 02:11:28.66 If you do want updates and here's basically what we'll send out is like, if there's a new design or a new hoodie or a new whatever.
02:11:28.66 --> 02:11:31.66 That's it, pretty much for the store.
02:11:31.66 --> 02:11:38.66 With the occasional, and when I say occasional, I mean, very occasional exception, where if there's like some important announcement.
02:11:38.66 --> 02:11:42.66 And important is like, there, it has to be very important.
02:11:42.66 --> 02:11:45.66 What's an example of an important announcement that's come out on the email list?
02:11:45.66 --> 02:11:46.66 Because I'm on this.
02:11:46.66 --> 02:11:49.66 I'm on this. Come out. Yeah. None. Okay, that's right.
02:11:49.66 --> 02:11:51.66 I love to say I haven't gotten any more.
02:11:51.66 --> 02:11:53.66 Yes. I'm just saying that control.
02:11:53.66 --> 02:11:54.66 No, no, no.
02:11:54.66 --> 02:12:05.66 None have been, but I'm saying if there was like, hey, freaking no podcast for one month or something that like, I would anticipate a bunch of people training email.
02:12:05.66 --> 02:12:12.66 Me or you about, then maybe, but I mean, I can't think of anything off hand specifically, but it'll be real important.
02:12:12.66 --> 02:12:15.66 I think I will firmly believe that it's important.
02:12:15.66 --> 02:12:21.66 Otherwise, you're just going to get new stuff every what once a month, maybe once every two, three months.
02:12:21.66 --> 02:12:22.66 Yes. Maybe.
02:12:22.66 --> 02:12:24.66 Anyway, I'm not going to be easy.
02:12:24.66 --> 02:12:27.66 That's what I'm saying. I realize that everyone's inbox is sacred.
02:12:27.66 --> 02:12:35.66 Where do they sign up for this email address listing on joccostore.com at the bottom?
02:12:35.66 --> 02:12:39.66 Should I make some kind of an email?
02:12:39.66 --> 02:12:41.66 Hey, no, no, no.
02:12:41.66 --> 02:12:45.66 Okay. I don't think so. You know, leave everybody alone.
02:12:45.66 --> 02:12:47.66 That's like what people are all into.
02:12:47.66 --> 02:12:48.66 Oh, you should.
02:12:48.66 --> 02:12:52.66 Yeah, and I dig it. That's like the, what do you call it?
02:12:52.66 --> 02:12:56.66 Have you ever gotten an email from somebody that's like, like, you sign up for an email list?
02:12:56.66 --> 02:13:04.66 And then you get an email, but it says it's from the person you go, oh, it's from someone so, but then it's just a massive mail.
02:13:04.66 --> 02:13:09.66 Yeah. Well, because sometimes it is from that person, but it is a massive mail.
02:13:09.66 --> 02:13:12.66 Okay. But sometimes it's from like their marketing company.
02:13:12.66 --> 02:13:13.66 Yeah. Whatever.
02:13:13.66 --> 02:13:15.66 Those are the ones that I go, come on, man.
02:13:15.66 --> 02:13:16.66 Yeah, but I felt all good.
02:13:16.66 --> 02:13:19.66 But well, this one is good because this is actually from me.
02:13:19.66 --> 02:13:22.66 Yeah. So I'll try to make it look cool and official.
02:13:22.66 --> 02:13:26.66 You know, the cool pictures on there, but, but yes, it is coming for me.
02:13:26.66 --> 02:13:28.66 I have friends.
02:13:28.66 --> 02:13:29.66 Yes.
02:13:29.66 --> 02:13:32.66 That, you know, kind of have email list, right?
02:13:32.66 --> 02:13:33.66 Yeah.
02:13:33.66 --> 02:13:33.66 Sure.
02:13:33.66 --> 02:13:36.66 And, and I'm on their email list.
02:13:36.66 --> 02:13:41.66 Yeah. But then I'm also have, you know, will exchange personally emails, right?
02:13:41.66 --> 02:13:41.66 Right.
02:13:41.66 --> 02:13:43.66 About whatever topic.
02:13:43.66 --> 02:13:48.66 And it got get an email from like an email, I'll show up and I go, oh, oh, that's cool.
02:13:48.66 --> 02:13:51.66 So, and then I open up and it's one of those things.
02:13:51.66 --> 02:13:52.66 It's always like, oh, dude.
02:13:52.66 --> 02:13:53.66 That's a bummer.
02:13:53.66 --> 02:13:54.66 Yeah.
02:13:54.66 --> 02:13:55.66 What do you mean, like Sam Harris?
02:13:55.66 --> 02:13:56.66 Just whoever.
02:13:56.66 --> 02:13:57.66 Oh, yeah.
02:13:57.66 --> 02:13:57.66 You name him.
02:13:57.66 --> 02:14:00.66 I signed up for Sam Harris's email list, but it was,
02:14:00.66 --> 02:14:03.66 happened to be at the same time where I sort of like,
02:14:03.66 --> 02:14:06.66 met him in sort of like, no, and then I seen it like from Sam Harris.
02:14:06.66 --> 02:14:07.66 I was like, yes.
02:14:07.66 --> 02:14:09.66 Sam Harris is emailing in, then it's like his podcast thing.
02:14:09.66 --> 02:14:11.66 I was like, I felt that.
02:14:11.66 --> 02:14:12.66 It was cool.
02:14:12.66 --> 02:14:13.66 I signed up for a reason.
02:14:13.66 --> 02:14:17.66 So I was like, but that expectation that it's actually him emailing you being like,
02:14:17.66 --> 02:14:19.66 Hey, great to meet you or something like this, you know?
02:14:19.66 --> 02:14:20.66 Yeah.
02:14:20.66 --> 02:14:20.66 Yeah.
02:14:20.66 --> 02:14:21.66 Kind of.
02:14:21.66 --> 02:14:21.66 That's funny.
02:14:21.66 --> 02:14:25.66 No, I get it, but I get, you know, quite a few friends like that,
02:14:25.66 --> 02:14:29.66 you know, where, and you know, I don't, I'm not a big communicator.
02:14:29.66 --> 02:14:31.66 And I don't have a ton of friends anyways.
02:14:31.66 --> 02:14:35.66 So when I do get emails from my friends, it's always, because I get a lot of business emails,
02:14:35.66 --> 02:14:39.66 obviously, but then when people email my personally email, you know,
02:14:39.66 --> 02:14:43.66 and I go, oh, and then I see that it's a form of me, my God.
02:14:43.66 --> 02:14:45.66 Oh, well, well,
02:14:45.66 --> 02:14:47.66 I mean, that quite is a say to you.
02:14:47.66 --> 02:14:51.66 But sometimes it has spurred me to email them, right?
02:14:51.66 --> 02:14:54.66 I've gone, you know, and then they email me back and we have a cool
02:14:54.66 --> 02:14:55.66 something.
02:14:55.66 --> 02:14:56.66 Oh, it reminds me.
02:14:56.66 --> 02:14:57.66 Yeah.
02:14:57.66 --> 02:15:00.66 I say, well, it gave me that feeling like, oh, that's cool to hear from this person or that person.
02:15:00.66 --> 02:15:03.66 Maybe they were thinking the same thing.
02:15:03.66 --> 02:15:05.66 Why am I not email them?
02:15:05.66 --> 02:15:08.66 Who am I supposed to not, not taking an initiative here?
02:15:08.66 --> 02:15:08.66 Yeah.
02:15:08.66 --> 02:15:12.66 So then I'll take some initiative and say, hey, I listen to your last podcast or hey,
02:15:12.66 --> 02:15:13.66 I saw you do that thing.
02:15:13.66 --> 02:15:14.66 And they go, oh, cool.
02:15:14.66 --> 02:15:15.66 You know what I mean?
02:15:15.66 --> 02:15:16.66 Yeah.
02:15:16.66 --> 02:15:21.66 So it's a little indirect prompt to kind of relate to people.
02:15:21.66 --> 02:15:23.66 Yeah, reach out, man.
02:15:23.66 --> 02:15:24.66 Yeah.
02:15:24.66 --> 02:15:25.66 Can't pick up a phone.
02:15:25.66 --> 02:15:26.66 Yeah.
02:15:26.66 --> 02:15:27.66 It's true.
02:15:27.66 --> 02:15:28.66 All right.
02:15:28.66 --> 02:15:29.66 Well, nonetheless, there you go.
02:15:29.66 --> 02:15:30.66 So yeah, jockelster.com.
02:15:30.66 --> 02:15:32.66 That's where all this stuff is.
02:15:32.66 --> 02:15:37.66 Also, if you want to subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, I don't
02:15:37.66 --> 02:15:40.66 know, sounds kind of weird because you're probably already are subscribed.
02:15:40.66 --> 02:15:41.66 Maybe maybe not, I don't know.
02:15:41.66 --> 02:15:42.66 I have a question.
02:15:42.66 --> 02:15:43.66 Yeah.
02:15:43.66 --> 02:15:43.66 Yeah.
02:15:43.66 --> 02:15:44.66 You of course.
02:15:44.66 --> 02:15:44.66 Yeah.
02:15:44.66 --> 02:15:45.66 Me too.
02:15:45.66 --> 02:15:47.66 But if you're not subscribed, you want to subscribe, boom.
02:15:47.66 --> 02:15:51.66 Let me remind you that that option is available for you.
02:15:51.66 --> 02:15:53.66 We also have some other podcasts.
02:15:53.66 --> 02:15:57.66 We have a podcast formerly known as the thread, which I was this close to renaming.
02:15:57.66 --> 02:16:00.66 And I didn't like it.
02:16:00.66 --> 02:16:03.66 And then I found, then I found the ultimate new name for it.
02:16:03.66 --> 02:16:10.66 And there's already another podcast, which I can't even believe exists with this name that I can't believe has already been taken.
02:16:10.66 --> 02:16:13.66 So I'm still in the midst of finding out a new name for that.
02:16:13.66 --> 02:16:14.66 Well, what was the name?
02:16:14.66 --> 02:16:16.66 I'm not going to say it.
02:16:16.66 --> 02:16:17.66 Why not?
02:16:17.66 --> 02:16:20.66 Because it's just, I'm not going to say it.
02:16:20.66 --> 02:16:22.66 We're just so you're still let down.
02:16:22.66 --> 02:16:23.66 I was not saying.
02:16:23.66 --> 02:16:29.66 So we just pointed and also I want to see if there's a way that I can still manipulate the name enough to use it.
02:16:29.66 --> 02:16:30.66 Oh, right, right, right.
02:16:30.66 --> 02:16:31.66 Gotcha.
02:16:31.66 --> 02:16:33.66 But I don't want to give it away.
02:16:33.66 --> 02:16:38.66 Grounded podcast where we talk about you, Jitsu, which we talked about you, Jitsu, Jitsu a lot anyway.
02:16:38.66 --> 02:16:40.66 So, but we talked about it even more.
02:16:40.66 --> 02:16:41.66 And we talk about life.
02:16:41.66 --> 02:16:43.66 And we talk about everything else on the grounded podcast.
02:16:43.66 --> 02:16:45.66 We got the Warrior Kid podcast for your warrior kids.
02:16:45.66 --> 02:16:51.66 We got Warrior Kid soap from IrishOxRent.com, a young warrior kid making soap.
02:16:51.66 --> 02:16:56.66 So everybody out there in the entire world can stay clean.
02:16:56.66 --> 02:17:04.66 We got a YouTube channel, which is where Echo takes videos and he puts them all in there.
02:17:04.66 --> 02:17:06.66 Sometimes he puts modifications.
02:17:06.66 --> 02:17:11.66 I said last time that he should put enhancements into just the podcast.
02:17:11.66 --> 02:17:15.66 So when I talk about counterinsurgency, what I talk about weapons,
02:17:15.66 --> 02:17:18.66 something should happen in this.
02:17:18.66 --> 02:17:22.66 You didn't do it. Whatever total lack of initiative, but it's all good.
02:17:22.66 --> 02:17:25.66 I'm sure there's someone out there that would love to modify these things.
02:17:25.66 --> 02:17:26.66 Yeah.
02:17:26.66 --> 02:17:30.66 To me, the jury is still outweathering out that's a good idea.
02:17:30.66 --> 02:17:32.66 So, you know what I'm going to think about it?
02:17:32.66 --> 02:17:35.66 Why don't we test it? Why don't we see?
02:17:35.66 --> 02:17:39.66 Next time when we do this podcast, you know, you make your little notes.
02:17:39.66 --> 02:17:40.66 You make your little notes.
02:17:40.66 --> 02:17:41.66 Yeah, make your little notes.
02:17:41.66 --> 02:17:45.66 You should be like, oh, when I talk about all there is this massive explosion.
02:17:45.66 --> 02:17:49.66 You could just make a little note that says, like, one hour and 37 minutes.
02:17:49.66 --> 02:17:50.66 Explosions.
02:17:50.66 --> 02:17:52.66 Here's the thing.
02:17:52.66 --> 02:17:55.66 Jock, for somebody that freaking just puts explosions everywhere.
02:17:55.66 --> 02:17:56.66 Yes, sir.
02:17:56.66 --> 02:18:01.66 Yeah, and I'm an explosion advocate, as far as video goes, 100%.
02:18:01.66 --> 02:18:03.66 But here's the thing.
02:18:03.66 --> 02:18:04.66 Here's the thing with that.
02:18:04.66 --> 02:18:08.66 So let's say I put a cool machine gun sound, explosions, whatever.
02:18:08.66 --> 02:18:14.66 Whatever we put in one single person on YouTube with one of those
02:18:14.66 --> 02:18:17.66 ghost accounts that like, you know, no profile picture.
02:18:17.66 --> 02:18:20.66 One of those guys says, that's corny,
02:18:20.66 --> 02:18:25.66 but it's going to like devastate me, I think, us.
02:18:25.66 --> 02:18:26.66 Okay.
02:18:26.66 --> 02:18:27.66 We can do it.
02:18:27.66 --> 02:18:28.66 That's an indicator.
02:18:28.66 --> 02:18:29.66 It's a long day hard enough.
02:18:29.66 --> 02:18:31.66 I'm just talking to tough enough.

02:22:26.66 --> 02:22:27.66 And you have to take.
02:22:27.66 --> 02:22:29.66 You have to think strategic.
02:22:29.66 --> 02:22:31.66 And you have to play the long game.
02:22:31.66 --> 02:22:33.66 And it's not easy.
