wow well more people are going to hear here this version then that version how you like that go and back to the account now the torpedo boats began firing it us with machine guns shooting anything that moved including firefighters and stretcher bears one of the guys I was pulling to safety got hit right above the knee with a 50 caliber slot causing explosion of blood and bone I took off my shirt and tied the sleeves around the top of his leg as tight as I could to stop the bleeding we got him down to the mess decks and untied the turnic it for just a few seconds so that they wouldn't be forced to amputate the leg later then we retided before leaving the area a median I went back up to the main deck and saw that that the gunners on the torpedo boats were now shooting at the ship on the waterline aiming in the direction of the boilers and from merely 35 yards away clearly they were trying now to blow up the ship by hitting the boilers and causing a huge explosion that their last torpedo had failed to accomplish throughout the course the torpedo boat attacked they circled the ship like voltiers at as close as a hundred feet to suggest that they might have missed the huge lettering on both sides of the bow in ten foot high letters as well as the USS Liberty lettering on the stern seems impossible and you're sitting there seeing these guys just lay into you with 50 caliber machine guns from a hundred yards away yes sir and nothing to fight back with the are willing and which and the pleasure of taking another breath is what kept us all going and pretty fortunate to be here jacco i saw one of the torpedo boats a lot closer than a hundred yards one of the miles on the port wing of bridges I spent a lot of time out there making sure the flag was flying and I saw one of the torpedo boats sail very slowly at our port support side I didn't see him fire anything I know that Phil had two or three books at Hevero the one that you referenced earlier about Ron and Cookele Phil's also a contributor to that book and Ernest Gallo is another member of the crew that helped you know with that how long were you in the Navy for 21 years you get a purple heart for being wounded on I did and what would you tell people when some other you know you're out you're you're just whites for whatever reason and you know 1975 there's guys were in Vietnam sure some you know guys there's some it's corpsmen some medics some pilots some aviators might have got purple hearts some some guys from the sea wolves or something but there's not a lot of navy guys running around in 1975 1980 1985 that had purple hearts what did you say to somebody when they said hey where did you get that purple heart from I was on the U.S. a celebrity in 1967 when we were attacked and you know I got it for Shrept and wounds and that was about it you know and i if you want to hear more from us then you can go on the social media of course surge in general warning watch out for the aglorism because it's getting ready grab you by the trope and try and drag you in there echoes at aquatrol's i am a joccal willing and thanks once again to joe larry and fill for your service in sacrifice and thanks to all the sailors of the us s liberty especially those 34 brave souls who sacrificed their lives for their shipmates and thanks to all the rest of the sailors out there from the world's finest navy that are on the high seas 365 days a year protecting the cause of freedom around the world and thanks to the rest of our military that fights on the land and in the air to protect our way of life and also to our police and law enforcement fire fighters paramedics entese dispatchers correction officers board patrol secret service all first responders who protect us here at home thank you for what you do and everyone else you never know what you're going to run into you never know what's going to happen you never know who is going to attack you and these guys talked about it today they were prepared they were ready they were vigilant so when something unfolds you are prepared like they were to behave like they did the brave sailors of the us s liberty and don't ever give up and until next time the zeco and jocco out and I mean there was information that I knew should have been in there that had to deal with communications that that didn't reflect those communications and the thing that they were trying to report more than anything else was a lack of communications that occurred resulting from this hundred mile um free zone I guess that Israel had declared no no ship should enter into that hundred miles zone off the coast of Sinai and apparently our naval atoshae and um and Israel had told them that we don't have any navy ships there six fleet confirmed that they didn't have any any naval ships there and that's you know a problem with us traveling by ourselves that they they they didn't recognize that we were over there or they conveniently forgot that we were there but there was communications that were supposed to have been sent us telling us to move back off the coast and we never received those communications and so that's more about what this report from NSA said and it didn't talk about the other intercepts that had you know the aircraft talking to ground control we're talking about the target talking about seeing the American flag and you know I don't know why that didn't come out until later but we kept doing a freedom movement information act requests trying to get a lot of this documentation back out in the public so the truth could be told so Joe what did you do after the incident so place how much longer were you in the navy for did you stay and what did you do I got out you know one of the things that it said is what you said earlier Phil which is hey if the is Rayleigh's could get the Americans into this war in a big way you know that can really help us out against these Arabs is what is Rayleigh was thinking and these kind of things happen what is what do you guys do with the LBA now what's what's the purpose how can people help well one of the things that we're still trying to do is get recognition for our 34th fall in shipmates we've tried over the years to get Congress to conduct a fallen impartial investigation and it's fallen on deaf ears right now we've got a resolution going forward to the ask for June 8th to be declared as a US celebrity remembered stay it should be a fairly simple thing for Congress to do I mean we have national hot dog day in national you know ice cream day let's have a national US as Liberty remembered stay and not just one year but every year and you know if nothing else you're you're honoring the 34 men that gave the ultimate sacrifice back on June 8th 1967 when when you talk about some of the awards that were received most every one of us that received any kind of an award purple heart or prom star you know the Congressional Medal of Honor it was all done in private there were no big ceremonies like you would normally expect for you know someone with that just came off the most decorated ship in the United States Navy since World War II and you know 95% of the American public is not even aware but you know Jacob he said something very interesting about the American Legion which fires me up because about four or five years ago Len Hall of the and Ernest Gallo our former president we're at the convention in the American Legion and they're wanted to get a booth and things like this and we hung out together in better times playing card strength if you beers and joking together we just locked eyes and communicated silently that we might not make it through this one I went off to find more CO2 canisters and I ran back towards the bridge falling in the process which caused the CO2 canister to fly out of my hands and crashed down the deck with a bang as soon as I got up I saw that I saw what it caused me to slip and fall it was blood on the deck that hadn't been there moments before when I left the bridge it was my friend Francis Brown's blood who had caught a machine gun bullet or a piece of shrapnel in the back of his head and his blood was everywhere his eyes were closed but his face was swelled up like a balloon there was something that no human being should ever have to see especially when it's a good friend of yours in a little while after going below deck and seeing more scenes like that I looked like a slaughterhouse with a cacophony of wailing and desperation in the background the wounded men kept begging me to help them and it was frustrating for me not to be able to do that because I had to move them from the passageways into the mess hall so they could get the medical attention they needed finally the jet attack was over and I went back to the top deck and then saw Torbito boats coming at us at a high rate of speed and now I saw who it was the star of David Flags flying above these boats was quite a surprise and at first I assumed they were coming to our rescue the delusion only lasted a minute because I then saw the splash of several torpedoes that they dropped into the water as they headed towards us did you know they were torpedoes and you know we we had no way to defend ourselves and you guys mentioned this already but just to just to reiterate there was some heroic activity to place for people for some of your shipmates to get onto the deck of the ship and string up a long wire antenna and send out an SOS message and that actually made it to to six feet which was you know like I talked earlier about big groups of ships and you guys traveled solo but normally the US Navy travels and big groups of ships so that was the six fleet is one of these big groups of ships had an aircraft carrier and whatnot and they actually received the SOS that you guys were on travel under attack and and talk me through about what you know about how that how the response the rescue response got shut down very good question we didn't learn quite a while exactly why it went forward but I didn't realize that I had the strap and the wounds in my thigh because you're adrenaline is pumping so so fast that and you're taking care of others so I had blood from trying to take care of John Spicer and you know working with some of the other wounded that my my dongries were just kind of blood soaked and I didn't find out until I don't know I guess a day or two later when one of the doctors from one of the other ships was up in the dispensary and they were you know evaluating us to determine whether or not we'd sustained any injuries and of course I had a drop trial when he said how did you get those you know scars on your leg there and strap no wounds I said I don't know I was to bend there in the torpedo attack but as far as working through the night we did whatever we could to try and you know keep keep everyone calm it wasn't chaotic and it's covered with gray paint which might have saved his life since it became a giant bandage so that's the that's kind of the situation that took place where you that's what you received the bronze star for was that action going out into into the into the fire to try and recover wounded guys you continue here after all the wounded had been recovered I went to the log room the location of damage control central I saw and some John D scout there my superior officer who is burning documents the standard procedure in US military after briefing him and discussing the situation for a few minutes he ordered me to return to the deck to further assess the damages and put out any fires that were still burning on the way back I saw many wounded men bloody and moaning begging me for help but as I had no medical training there was not much I could do to help relieve their pain I got to the bridge and saw a commander at Nagel was badly wounded in the leg but still in command rocket and cannon holes were everywhere and burning napalm was dripping through the holes into the bridge compartment there were CO2 canisters that were not effective in fighting that kind of fire and I requested a team with water hoses but that didn't work either since the fire hoses had been shot up just like everything else I told the captain that I would return with some better equipment to fight the fires and he calmly replied do what you can sailor he was always very professional and stoic even under these incredibly violence surreal circumstances so you have napalm dripping through the holes onto the bridge I mean that's just crazy to think about it is crazy it is crazy it's a war crime dropping it on dropping it on us they wouldn't they they couldn't shoot us up so they tried to burn us up and the fire is just basically burn out because we couldn't put them out we didn't have the equipment COT CO2 was all gone everything was been had been utilized and so I go from a singleman school to a ship that doesn't need a signalman to a ship that has a very very intense signalman but after that I went I got out Halloween on 69 and same question to you I mean were you thinking to yourself what's one of the reasons you got out because you're thinking hey this crazy thing just happened to me I lost so many of my friends and now I'm told I can never talk about it again did that impact the way you thought about your career interesting thing about that um on this Elvenia there was a uh career counselor and every time you were getting short you would call you in this office and give you a long-speel about why you should trip over and stay in the navy so he didn't know he didn't know me personally and they didn't know my history so he called me into his office sat down really had one job and that was to know what was flying what the ship was flying and you know 100% that that that that the American flag was clearly visible and that you actually ended up raising an even bigger American flag that's right you know I might add to that uh jacco the uh is really war room had his plotted on their map as American and friendly they said they changed the watch and inadvertently forgot we were there and took us off their war table I mean come on man you know when you when you change watches you you inform everybody of what's going on and they just took it all the way and that's uh still it or it takes me and then he labored assault troops it was obvious to me and most people that their intention was to sink the ship and kill old any survivors speaking of that the the he-low-born assault troops here we go shortly after the boats left the scene from far off in the distance but closing in fast came the unmistaker will want want want want sound of a very large troop carrying helicopter approaching the ship on the starboard side now the one MC system blared all ships personnel prepared to rebel repel borders so now after all other weapons were brought to bear on our ship and failed the sinker we were about to be bordered by Marines armed with sub machine guns after the only machine guns on the ship had been destroyed in the wave of first attacks even if we could get to them in time the only other guns we had on the ship were small arms pistols and a couple of shot guns that we might use to set up a last line of defense a median eye tried to open the locker with our fire axes since our master at arms who is the only one with a key was not to be found even after beating that lock nearly pieces we could not break it the commandos on board the helicopter above appeared to be ready to repel on to our ship ready for close quarters combat with a bunch of defenses for drag-led sailors worn out from two hours of sustained attacks it would have been a turkey shoot I think we better just go get them that's just that was the whole is a land grab for Israel and in a power grab for LBGA to keep these war machine going in Vietnam and it's not like you guys got helped quickly you say this it's 18 hours a hell to call it a long night is a big understatement none of us slept for two reasons first we were afraid of the dark not like little kids but rather because we knew that criminals prefer the cover of darkness when doing their dirty work those responsible for the previous days attack might return to the scene of the crime to finish what they had failed to do earlier second we didn't know if the ship would even stay together although we were not sure of the exact size the whole in the starboard side we knew that it was big very big it was a lot of work that wouldn't be needed just to keep the ship afloat and moving away from the dangerous zone and with all the men killed or wounded only a skeleton crew remained to do this those of us who did survive were glad of that of course and then they just sail off and continue to attack how much time had passed between the initial strafing runs from the aircraft to the torpedo attack and is this an hour has gone by two hours or approximately two hours some people save more some people probably say less but to do that type of damage and in a few moments like these really said it just took a little while they only said they had only three aircraft that attacked us and there was probably twenty aircraft so to attack us to do that kind of damaging that's for the time it's just when you think back three airplanes can't carry the munitions would take to put over eight hundred fifty cannon rocket holes in the ship drop napalmons and just it doesn't make sense so as all this is going on you say all of the sounds of these machine guns and the sheer hell taking place might have been the reason why there was some controversy of whether commander mechanical ordered all crew prepared to abandon ship Do you guys feel like there's been progress towards getting the truth out there because to me I mean when I hear about the US Liberty now I immediately kind of most people know sort of the underlying story that it was an attack it was from Israel that you know the US Navy lost a bunch of sailors they don't necessarily know how many but do you guys feel like there's progress been made in the story getting out there in the truth getting out there there's progress being made but not to the extent that people who can do something about it do something about it so governments claiming mistake and identity they're claiming what like what exactly what's the explanation there are several explanations the main thing that what the what the government says the fashion say it's all the government's not all the government says this that this cover up at the time was hey it was mistaken identity it was a you know unfortunate incident the the Israeli said sorry we're carrying on with our mission there's two there's two real explanations one of them is that hey the Israelis didn't want Americans listening so they attacked the ship and there's one that is the Israelis wanted they wanted America to enter the war and they knew that America would enter the war if one of the American ships was attacked by these Arab forces and so they tried to do it in such a way that because you wouldn't think the Israelis would do that I mean that's like crazy right there's are are actual allies I don't like the way he led I don't like the way he did things and so this is just like another nail in the coffin for McNamara from my perspective to know that you know he was one of the people that allowed this stuff to happen and LBJ the same thing President Johnson same thing you know so yeah check out the

organization if you want to donate or you want to get involved go to america's mighty warriors dot org also don't forget about horses and heroes no heroes and horses I mean that's that's pretty freaking clear you guys got a bunch of awards for you know for what took place including the Medal of Honor Captain McConnell received the Medal of Honor for for his actions which is strange to take the story of someone receiving the Medal of Honor not explained what happened that was covered up in an naval shipyard that's where he received these Medal of Honor and shipyard not it's a White House where he can be recognized for being the skipper of our ship and getting the Medal of Honor because it brings too much heat on and unfortunately I think the captain was between a real rock in a hard place on one hand he can be treated like a hero on the other hand he can we can be treated like a Z-Roll and he went with hero I'm not saying he didn't deserve it and I hope you you watch it to spread the word jacco thank you thank you one one thing that should be noted about the 25 men killed by the torpedo is that they probably would have survived the attack if lb j hadn't recalled the aircraft that aircraft were already in in flight probably halfway to the liberty and would have driven off the the torpedo attack if they had been allowed to continue just to give people some more some more context as to what was actually happening for you guys your account fill as this is taking place you say this dead bodies were littered everywhere but there were also wounded bodies that we knew had to be found and saved if possible between valleys of bullets and rockets we darted out from safe cover grab the wounded men wanted a time drag them across the deck and assisted them down the hatch others from down below took them from there and moved them to the mess halls where they could be treated they took us at least 15 minutes to clear the decks of those who were still alive and could be saved about 25 men all together one of the worst cases I saw was time Tom Riley a boasts and mate who was on his back and bleeding from multiple wounds but we were not to about to go down without a fight for our lives had they proceeded they could have murdered the entire crew and then proceeded to use whatever explosives they had to guarantee the ship's destruction as the helicopter hovered overhead no more than 75 feet away I locked eyes with one of the Marines these are Israeli Marines who is sitting on the floor of the helicopter his legs were hanging out he had one foot on the skid below as he waited for an order to repel down to the ship's deck and finish us off as I stood on the deck of my bloody and battered ship I thought about everything that had happened over the course of that afternoon about my good friends Francis Brown and David Skolack and all the other men whose remains were strewn all over the ship the only two-eyed left was my middle finger and I used it to let him know what I thought of him in the rest of his team he simply gave me a smile and returned the gesture and then they they backed off right No I just encourage your listeners to you know take what we've said today and if they have any interest at all and trying to support the Liberty go to our website contact us you know our contact information is on the website and like I said I'm willing to draft resolutions or petitions whatever they want for their organization to get signatures to take before their legislators and trying to get support for this recognition for our fallen ship rates that should have happened 55 years ago. I read a lesson what back then navy and it got stationed for the US as Maddox he just uh 731 that was in the talking dog talk that's how the Vietnam War started and some of the original crewmates were still on there it said hey turning that that never happened that's all BS it was a pretext for war they Johnson dreamed up and it turned right back around to the US has a liberty another pretext phony outcome to keep his war machine going to Vietnam and it's a land grab for Israel and a permanent foothold in the area for the United States so you when you got to the Maddox and they're talking about those attacks those you know supposed attacks and the guys would say I didn't happen and I was thinking to myself if this ship goes down I'm going to go down with it because I'm not going to get in the water and try to stay alive and let them guys shoot me in the water I'd better go down to ship and that was why I intentionally was going down but the ship just just we're actually stopped listing how what do you think and Larry as this as you're hearing the countdown comes starbird side that's got to be absolutely horrifying it was I got another statement here this is from this is from Lieutenant General Marshall S. Carger director of the NSA under who's authority the liberty was operating he said couldn't be anything else but deliberate there's just no way you could have a series of circumstances that would justify this being an accident you know as my friend Darrell Cooper pointed out when this attack happens once an international lodge an even convention when a when a naval vessel gets disabled you're then as the attacker responsible for trying to help lend aid to that ship and certainly the sailors that are that are in the water if they're in the water you're not supposed to be gunning up their lifeboats and strafing their their the decks of their ship as they're already disabled vessel and I personally put one of them into the water as I watched all three and flate only to see them immediately shot up two sank but one of them was taking a board one of the boats as a trophy that capped the series of horrors I witnessed that day and told me as clearly as anything else that the purpose of the attack was not just to cripple the ship and take it out of commission so that it could not ease drop on communications but to actually sink our ship the active destroying our life boats was an unmistakable sign that they wanted no survivors left to tell anyone what had happened Lord Painter testified about that he he witnessed the machine gunning of the life rafts and he testified about that during the US Navy Court of Inquiry but if you get a copy of the Court of Inquiry his test of money has been removed not redacted removed from the record what do you think and when you hear a band and ship what are you thinking about Larry did you hear that call I did Indeed on our blog there's a USS Liberty veterans dot blog there's a tab that says I think it's help us out and in that tab or a series I think four letters you can write to you can just fill in the blank and submit one is calling for have a member of Congress send you a copy of the Congressional investigations and they can't do it one is asking them to contact the Congressional Research Service and ask them to ask the US government and investigate the attack and we got a response from one I've been trying for years and one finally actually asked the the Congressional Research Service and he said no another one asks for Congress to allow their boilerplate responses to members to constituents who write asking about the attack stop using Israeli talking points use USS Liberty survivors talking points and the the the season way to for them to get involved and then when they get the responses send them to us and we can draft a a response for them to to send. he's got a gym he's a firefighter he's a pilot a helicopter pilot so the codemire he's got another business which is called flipside canvas dot com and you can get cool stuff to hang on your wall there and for books look the books I just mentioned um a racing liberty by Phil attorney we got his other book Holocaust on the high seas there's also a book called remember the liberty by Philip Nelson and Ron kooka which I Ron put this podcast together today I mentioned him so you can check out his book also speaking of doing a bunch of different things we got jockel publishing and jockel publishing has published some books published Mikey in the Dragons published way the warrior kid three and four also Holly McKay she wrote a book called only cry for the living and right now so she's been in Afghanistan
