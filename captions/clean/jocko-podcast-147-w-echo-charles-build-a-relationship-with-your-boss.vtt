00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 147 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, Echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And it's been a little while since we've done some Q&A. So we're gonna do some Q&A. Cool. Thanks to everyone for the question.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yes, that you have submitted to the podcast. Just to remind you, what's the best way to submit a question?

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The best way is Twitter or Facebook. And yeah, those are the best way to do your Facebook.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.000
My Facebook or my Twitter. I don't. The Instagram messages are just out of control. There's too many of them. And I appreciate it.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But I can't get a grip on them. So Twitter and people, what if it's a long question? Well, right, three Twitter statements. If it's longer than, you know, that many characters. It's probably then go to Facebook. If it's like really a long, long thing, then just go to Facebook.

7
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And send me the message. What does that call a Facebook message?

8
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Instant Messenger Direct Message. I think DM is like a content.

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Okay. Anyway, message or call on Facebook is what I get.

10
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Again, I apologize. I don't get to respond to all of them. So I'm just trying to get somebody a little like, hey, I read it. Hey, thanks.

11
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You know, you know what to do. Right? A lot of times people, they're just asking me because they want to get confirmed.

12
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Yeah, yeah, you know, I do think I'm having problems with this girl and she cheated on me. But I don't know if I should leave or not.

13
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
You know what to do, bro. You know what to do. Yeah. So speaking of, thanks for everyone for the questions.

14
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And and that being said, I still look at just about everything that comes in. Sometimes sometimes they get a little bit lost. But I look at everything that comes in.

15
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Sometimes people, if you're listening, if you send me a question, some people ask me a question that I've literally been asked and we've answered on the podcast three or four times.

16
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So keep listening to the podcast because if I don't say anything most likely, it's because I've answered that over.

17
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I've answered it two or three times.

18
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Or you can do what to do just from listening to the podcast. You'll figure out, oh, I need to go get after it. Like.

19
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Yeah, when in Delco, I think that it might be a good idea to have like a what are you going to call frequently asked.

20
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Yeah, I know. I know.

21
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But we do need to do that.

22
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Yeah.

23
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So let's do it.

24
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Check.

25
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
First question.

26
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We said that for like two years.

27
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Yeah, I didn't write when I said that I'll say.

28
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Yeah.

29
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
No.

30
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000
No, do 10 Debbie put together like a whole thing on that. Maybe. Yeah, she did. So we could probably dig that up and actually put it to use.

31
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Yeah.

32
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Which would be smart.

33
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Yes, sir. I believe.

34
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I believe the same thing.

35
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
First question.

36
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Do you have any thoughts on what disciplines someone can use to improve their decision-making skills as a leader?

37
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Not only in keeping clarity of thought during high-pressored situations and environments,

38
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
but also in making the correct decisions when it is vital.

39
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Okay. So we talked about this last week.

40
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You have to learn to detach and how do you learn to detach by putting yourself in stressful situations and then observing how you react.

41
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So good stressful situations to put yourself in.

42
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Well, what makes you stressed one thing that will make everyone stressed especially when they first start is start with you.

43
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
You get to that's going to that's going to put you in stressful environments.

44
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Look at sports.

45
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
What are you going to do?

46
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You know, put yourself in stressful positions and sports.

47
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
What else makes you stressed?

48
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Public speaking.

49
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Right? Public speaking makes some people really stressed out.

50
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Start doing it more.

51
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
What about competition shooting where you've got a or hunting where you've got to do something in a stressful environment or

52
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
archery. You know, I started archery recently.

53
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You did.

54
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Yeah.

55
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And so that's one of those things where you've got to learn to detach,

56
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
you're going to learn to pay attention to things that are going on.

57
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
If you're all caught up in the moment, then you're going to miss it.

58
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So that's number one.

59
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
If you want to learn to deal with stress, put yourself in stressful situations that are under some kind of control.

60
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
You know, even something like paintball, you know,

61
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
we do gigs at echelon front when we put people through what we call FTX's,

62
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
where you go out and you're going to fire.

63
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We usually use airsoft because it's a little bit more.

64
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It's a little easier to work with.

65
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
But actually what we started using now is we've got things high end laser tag guns.

66
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And so that's that's what we use and they are super effective.

67
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
They're they're awesome.

68
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
They're awesome training tools.

69
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Like if we were to have them, if we would have if they would have existed,

70
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
when I was in the sealed teams, I would have used them then because they're that good.

71
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So we use those and we put people in stressful situation.

72
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Go hit this target.

73
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
There's bad guys.

74
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
You know, people are going to get shot.

75
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
There's people yelling.

76
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Put yourself in stressful situations and learn to detach.

77
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Put yourself in stressful situations with the purpose of learning to detach and

78
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
stepping back mentally to figure out what's going on.

79
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Okay.

80
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
That's first part.

81
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Next part is how do we make good decisions?

82
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Well, number one, making correct decisions.

83
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You've got a study.

84
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You've got to know and understand.

85
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
You've got to know the background.

86
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
You've got to know the historical outcomes of

87
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
the equivalent type decisions that have happened in the past similar situations.

88
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And if you know the history and you know the background,

89
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
then you can use those to assess the current situation you're in.

90
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And then once you assess the decisions that you can make assess the possible actions that you can take

91
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and then assess the outcomes that those decisions will have.

92
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Those actions will have.

93
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And when you're doing that, you also have to assess the possibilities of inaction.

94
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So a lot of times people forget that one.

95
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
They don't know if they should do A or B.

96
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
What they forget is there's also what if I don't do either.

97
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
What's going to happen?

98
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Sometimes not doing either is good.

99
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Most that were a lot of times not doing either is bad.

100
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So you've got A or B. What should you do?

101
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Maybe sometimes you got to pick A or B.

102
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Sometimes occasionally it's better not to do anything.

103
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And you wait and let the situation develop a little bit more.

104
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So the point of this is whatever you can know beforehand, you know.

105
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
You learn, you study, you understand.

106
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
You know the standard operating procedures.

107
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
You know what variants variations have been made on the standard operating procedures.

108
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And that's how you go forward.

109
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And you execute now the thing that you have to remember is that you can't know everything before hand.

110
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Which is why it goes back to study and practice, detaching and making decisions.

111
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So now let me dig into detachable a bit.

112
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Let's actually break that down.

113
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Maybe some mechanical steps that you can use.

114
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Number one step back.

115
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But literally physically take a step back from the situation that you're in and move your head and look around.

116
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So when we used to shoot, they would teach us to scan.

117
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Like you would have to physically move your head.

118
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And what that is is a mental reminder that you need to look around and assess what's happening.

119
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So once you've taken a step off the line,

120
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
whether that's taken a step back from the table and you're meeting.

121
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
If you're a firefighter and there's a fire happening,

122
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
take a step back so you can see the bigger picture.

123
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
If you're in a cop and there's a shoot out happening, where can you go to step back,

124
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
get some cover and look around and see what's actually happening.

125
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
If you're in a conversation with someone, stop talking.

126
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000
If there's an argument going on, stop talking, take a step back and actually listen to all the other elements that are shouting and yelling at each other.

127
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
If there's a decision that needs to be made,

128
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
an planning situation, step back from the plan.

129
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Don't just take a step back from it.

130
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Look at it more broadly.

131
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So that step number one is to step back.

132
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Number two, then you're going to come up with, hey, one of the possible decisions that I can make.

133
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I go this way.

134
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I go ABD, ABCD.

135
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I can do any one of these things.

136
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Keep an open mind.

137
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
This is the problem some people have.

138
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
They come up with two decisions, three decisions, and they don't think about anything else.

139
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So you kind of have to like repeatedly detach.

140
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
You kind of have to stay detached.

141
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
That's why it's good.

142
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
You throw out an idea like for planning for something.

143
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And I come up with three ideas.

144
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I say, echo, what do you think of these?

145
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I give them to you then I step back again.

146
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I keep my mind open.

147
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So that's why the more you can get your subordinates to plan, the better off you're going to be.

148
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
The more you can get, the people below you in the chain of command to come up with an idea,

149
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
or come up with the ideas, the better off you're going to be because you're not embroiled in it.

150
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
You're, you're de facto detached because you're letting them run with it.

151
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Then, okay, once you look at your decisions and you got to look at what the possible outcomes are.

152
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
What are the possible things that can happen?

153
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Is this could, how bad could this go?

154
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Risk versus reward.

155
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
You got to weigh those things out and you got to do it fairly quickly.

156
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And again, you got to figure out what's the result or possible outcome for inaction.

157
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And then you just weigh out these various options that you've created and you figure which one, which outcome has the most, which one makes the most sense.

158
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
That's, that's what's good.

159
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And like I said, inaction is some people like any action is better than no action.

160
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Not always true, not always true.

161
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Sometimes you can learn more by letting things develop and letting things reveal what the status is.

162
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So that does make sense and sometimes you do hold off.

163
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
If, if you, if you can see that a problem is getting worse though,

164
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Well, then we got to do something.

165
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Then generally, okay, let's make some kind of an decision very quickly.

166
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Now, one of the most important things to remember, and there's a little dichotomy to this,

167
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
is that you don't always have to make giant decisions.

168
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
You don't always have to make the, all, the, the all, powerful,

169
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
decision of might.

170
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
You know, it's like, do we go or do we not go?

171
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
You don't always have to say we go.

172
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So I'm not even going, well, let's push a little further.

173
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Let's, let's move a little bit further before we make that decision.

174
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Or hey, let's stay where we are and see if it develops or let's back up a little bit and keep watching.

175
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So instead of we go or we don't go, there's actually a bunch of different decisions that you can make besides we can go or don't go.

176
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
There's a building, there's a bad guy in it, let's go or let's not go.

177
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
No, actually, let's put eyes on the target for a little while.

178
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Let's, let's call and see if there's any other intelligence.

179
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Let's put a aircraft over there.

180
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
There's all kinds of decisions that you can make.

181
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Let's push a little bit closer.

182
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Let's stage.

183
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Let's monitor.

184
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So there's all kinds of decisions that you can make that allow the, the situation to develop further and maybe reveal the proper decision to you in the long run.

185
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
So my, my fear of saying that is that people be get paralyzed.

186
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
What does it analyze the parallel, parallel, parallel, parallel, yeah analysis paralysis.

187
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
That's my fear about saying that because the dichotomy is you can sit around and analyze and figure out and look at something for, forever.

188
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
While the situation changes and now you lose.

189
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So yes, you don't have to make giant decisions, but at the same time, you got to be decisive.

190
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
There's a dichotomy.

191
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Leadership is not easy.

192
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Road all book about it. dichotomy leadership. Why? Because that's what happens.

193
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So there you go.

194
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
That's my assessment of how you can prove your decision making skills.

195
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Experience goes away.

196
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Yes.

197
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Yeah, that's one of those just kind of when you're talking about the, the results versus the, the, the method, right decision making,

198
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
sometimes like the result actually both method and results kind of the value isn't even in the results.

199
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It's like you haven't getting that experience going through it, you know, it'll improve your decision making.

200
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
True. True.

201
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Yeah.

202
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Thank you.

203
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Anytime you can be in a situation where you're making decisions and getting experience out,

204
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
you're going to get better at it.

205
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Yeah.

206
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Kind of the value in role playing.

207
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
That is a value.

208
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
That's why we do a lot of role playing in our role.

209
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Kind of like a little thing.

210
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And people might think like, oh, that how does that work? Come and get it.

211
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I watch people all the time.

212
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
It totally improve as leaders because put them through role plays scenario as a leader,

213
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.000
where they're going up against a combative subordinate or a subordinate that's lazy or a subordinate that's angry or a subordinate that that wants to leave.

214
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Like you put a person role playing in those situations over and over again and they get so much better three iterations.

215
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Three iterations and people are exponentially better at handling such a lot of things.

216
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Yeah.

217
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Because it's like someone, I mean, most of the time,

218
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and it was just a matter of them like never seen it before.

219
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And then for you know, when it's in the during game time,

220
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
it's kind of like you got to make the decision super fast.

221
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
You can't and a,

222
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and a,

223
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
from the role playing situation,

224
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
you can analyze, you do whatever and then learn it.

225
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
No, that's a good one.

226
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I actually should have brought that up.

227
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
That's a great point is another way that you can get better at making decisions by role play.

228
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
For sure.

229
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Give yourself the options.

230
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Put, put your set set yourself up a pressure situation and have people role play it out with you of what you're going to do.

231
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Yeah.

232
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So it's kind of like like mock that.

233
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
That's basically, it is, it is mock experience.

234
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
That's basically what seal training well,

235
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
not the basics.

236
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
He was running, but the seal training that I ran, that's basically what it was.

237
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
We're going to have people act like bad guys and you're going to make decisions all day long.

238
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
That's a role play.

239
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Yeah.

240
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Get some.

241
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Yeah.

242
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Like remember, and again, going back to like just seen it once.

243
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
All right.

244
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
It's a good time.

245
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
It's a way bigger difference than then.

246
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I mean, compared with never seen it all versus seen it once.

247
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The difference between that is way bigger than seen it twice versus once.

248
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
You know, if you seen it once, it's kind of like, okay, now yeah, this is like 90 day.

249
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It's 90 day.

250
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
The difference between knowledge and like, no, no knowledge is crazy.

251
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Yeah.

252
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And we see that over and over and over again.

253
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Like on Indiana Jones and Alaska Crusade, everything now.

254
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I'm pretty sure, how old is that one?

255
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Like I saw the, like that series when I was a kid.

256
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I think I see it.

257
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So at the end, they go through.

258
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I had to see things, right?

259
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
They're like these booby traps, right?

260
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
They get the holy grail.

261
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
That's what they're doing.

262
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Oh, then I've seen this one because everyone the guys face melts, right?

263
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
No, that's really the last time.

264
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
When they open the arc.

265
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Oh, yeah.

266
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Shut your eyes.

267
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Yeah.

268
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
It's old school.

269
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Anyway, no, this one, they have to go through these, like,

270
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
these tests or whatever.

271
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
They're there booby traps to get to the holy grail.

272
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And one of them was you have to kneel.

273
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Only the penitent man will pass.

274
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
That's what it says in the grail diary, which is Indiana Jones Dad's diary that

275
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
took up a note and so he's like, oh, you got to interpret that, right?

276
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
So they had all these of people.

277
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
They were bad guys there too.

278
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So they just send to someone in there.

279
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And then the guide go in and his head gets chopped though.

280
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So you go in there.

281
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
You know, hey, that blade is going to come chopped off my head because I

282
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
seen that one guy get his head chopped off.

283
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I'm just going to duck.

284
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
It's one time it's like I don't know.

285
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
The blade's going to come out.

286
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Duck.

287
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Good point.

288
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Thanks, Indie.

289
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Grand, granted there was more booby traps.

290
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And you kind of got to refer to the grail diary for the answers.

291
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Subject to interpretation by the way, but same deal.

292
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
You see the point, all right?

293
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
If you walk through a hall, I get it.

294
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Yes.

295
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
It is chopped off.

296
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
You know, okay, a better duck.

297
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
No, you best duck.

298
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Yeah, I get it.

299
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Thank you.

300
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
One time.

301
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
That's all it takes.

302
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Anyway, next question.

303
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
How do you practice normal face?

304
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
So same and the reason I grew up these two questions together is because

305
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
there's a little, there's some similarities there.

306
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
You know, how do you practice normal face, which is a legitimate skill, by the way.

307
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Yes, sure.

308
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
It's, it's, oh, it's funny little game.

309
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
If you haven't heard of what you do as I used to do, my kids, I put line

310
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
them up.

311
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I'm a professional whatsoever besides just a normal plane face.

312
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I'd hit him in the head with a, the inside cardboard roll up of a wrapping paper.

313
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
So there's the game.

314
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And it's a lot of fun.

315
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
We'd have fun doing it in everyone's life.

316
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Well, it's also useful in this adult to be able to not show your emotions.

317
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So how do you do it?

318
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Same thing.

319
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Put yourself in stressful situations.

320
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And, you know, a good one is jujitsu.

321
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Do you do?

322
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
If you can just like act normal, even when someone's just crushing you,

323
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
then that's a positive thing.

324
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Like, you know, sometimes you and I are rolling.

325
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Yes.

326
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And you'll be like, oh, I've found a sense of urgency.

327
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Yes.

328
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
That's when I lose normal face.

329
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
It's failure to, keep normal face.

330
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
So I get a little bit scrambled because you're going to pass or something like that.

331
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
And then you, you then you feel all good.

332
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Yeah.

333
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Because you have me react.

334
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
You broke my normal face.

335
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
So yes, that's good.

336
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I would say the thing about normal face is practice at all times.

337
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
You know where you practice it.

338
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
You practice it like when you're driving.

339
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I mean, I don't can't do this anymore.

340
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
But when we started this podcast, I would get put questions all the time about road rage.

341
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
How do you prevent road rage?

342
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
How do you prevent road rage?

343
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.000
How do you prevent road rage?

344
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.000
How do you prevent road rage?

345
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
How do you get everyone's so in the game now that they're, they figured it out.

346
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Yeah.

347
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
But that's a good, you know, any time where there's something bad happening, like something annoying,

348
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
something like the line, the line at the DMV, the line wherever.

349
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And you just just just keep normal face and just act like whatever.

350
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Detach.

351
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And you'll just act normal.

352
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Easy money.

353
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Easy money.

354
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Indue.

355
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Don't act hired.

356
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Yeah.

357
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
That's like one of my, I try and maintain that rule all the time.

358
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
You taught me that.

359
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Oh, I don't even know if you meant to teach me that.

360
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
And I told the story before.

361
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
But I rolled it right here to get it.

362
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
That's it.

363
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
You weed rule.

364
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
And I'd be tired of whatever after rolling with you.

365
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And then, you know, and people do this all the time.

366
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And it sticks it.

367
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
It's like a red flag to me.

368
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Not a red flag warning of not, it just sticks out a lot when people do this.

369
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
After the round, they'll just flop on their back.

370
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

371
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
You know, like breathing all hard kind of just, you know, indicating that.

372
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Oh, that was a tiring round.

373
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Right?

374
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
You think, yeah, you need to have tiring rounds.

375
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Like, again, it kind of thing.

376
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
This is the message that you conveyed to me through your actions.

377
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
You didn't tell me this, but through you.

378
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So I roll with you and I do that or something along those lines.

379
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Oh, and you like stand up.

380
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Not breathing through your mouth.

381
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
I remember that.

382
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
You're just like, you know, like, month close.

383
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
And then you were looking at me.

384
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Almost like you're disappointed in me.

385
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
I was.

386
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Yeah, I know you were.

387
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Now thinking back, yes, I realized you probably were.

388
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And you said, you look a little tired.

389
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And then you just walked away.

390
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Mm-hmm.

391
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Like, man.

392
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Almost like that was the bad part.

393
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
The part that I looked tired.

394
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
That was like the bad part.

395
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
You didn't like, can I was like, from literally from then on,

396
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I had act like I wasn't tired in between.

397
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Even if I was tired, I've tried to act like I'm not tired actively.

398
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
That's so important.

399
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Mm-hmm.

400
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
It's important in life.

401
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Yeah.

402
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
You know, it's important as a leader.

403
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
It's way more important as a leader than anything else.

404
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
When you start to break, think, well, I don't know if you have an example.

405
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
But like, I think of times in my life where I would see my leader start to break.

406
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Mm-hmm.

407
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And just think, the cow horrible that is for the rest of the team.

408
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
And I'd be looking at a leader that was breaking.

409
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And I'd be like, man, you aren't letting everyone down.

410
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And you're not going to do it to me.

411
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
I'm going to, you know what, actually, this is an opportunity for me.

412
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
If you're looking weak, I'm not going to get all aggressive.

413
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
But I'm going to make sure that people aren't going to follow that attitude.

414
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Because that attitude is going to hurt us all.

415
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Yeah.

416
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
So as a leader, normal face is even more important.

417
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Yeah.

418
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I'm not saying you never show emotions.

419
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
This dichotomy.

420
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I'm not saying never show emotions as a leader.

421
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Because you absolutely do show emotions as a leader.

422
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
But you make sure that they're controlled.

423
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
You make sure they're not the most negative emotions.

424
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Yeah.

425
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
So am I saying to not be yourself?

426
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Yes, I am.

427
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Because if your self is being a weak loser and you're in charge of a team and you show everyone that, you're wrong.

428
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
No, you need to stifle those emotions, which we've talked about before.

429
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
You need to stifle those.

430
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
You need to act.

431
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
You need to act like, hey, we're going to make this happen.

432
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Yeah.

433
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
This doesn't mean lie to them.

434
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
This isn't like, hey, the boat sinking, but don't worry.

435
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
It's going to be okay.

436
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
No, hey, guess what?

437
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Boat sinking.

438
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
No, we're going to do.

439
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
We're going to break out of life.

440
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Jack is going to farm into pool. We're going to grab whatever we can off this festival.

441
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
We're going to make sure we get some, you know what I mean?

442
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Yeah.

443
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Has opposed to the boat sinking.

444
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Right.

445
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Yeah.

446
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
So you lead.

447
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Jack.

448
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
So if, um, what, like, when your kid falls down, right?

449
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Yeah, totally.

450
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Totally.

451
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Like, yeah, you know what my gosh, are you okay?

452
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Yeah, I'm right.

453
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Negative over there.

454
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Yeah.

455
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Yeah.

456
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Wait, how's it?

457
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I was at the park.

458
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
My son too.

459
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Climes up high on this thing is like, slanted jungle gym kind of thing is just slanted.

460
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Like, pretty high.

461
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Where's not like so high that he shouldn't be up there.

462
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
It's not that.

463
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
But it's, it's high where you got to keep an eye on that thing right there.

464
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
And sure enough, he takes a step or whatever and just straight up falls to the ground.

465
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
And the ground is, ah, the ground was like a bunch of this weird hay kind of stuff.

466
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
So it's, it wasn't like concrete, put it that way.

467
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
But he fell down, full on.

468
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And the kind of, you know, kind of other parents are looking in my life is sitting right

469
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
me kind of far away.

470
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
We had a gravity.

471
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And my daughter was there.

472
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
She's super caring too.

473
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
So I'm like, I should have grabbed her too, but she's far away.

474
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Anyway, so he falls down.

475
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Of course, it doesn't cry.

476
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
It's more like surprise and stun and looking around.

477
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Almost with the look on his face like, how should I react right now?

478
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Yeah, that's exactly what he's doing.

479
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Yeah.

480
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
And then it's all good.

481
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Yeah.

482
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
I mean, I'm not reacting.

483
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Yeah.

484
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
So I mean, I mean, when I'm, my kids would take a day.

485
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
My kids would take a day.

486
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
I'd start laughing.

487
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
You know, that was awesome.

488
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Yeah, yeah, makes sense.

489
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And then they're like, really?

490
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Yeah.

491
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Yeah.

492
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
That was awesome.

493
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
We got a little scanner.

494
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Nice.

495
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Oh, look, you're bleeding.

496
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Yeah.

497
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
That's going to leave a cool scar.

498
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Yeah.

499
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
You're awesome.

500
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Welcome to the club.

501
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Yeah.

502
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
That's a good one.

503
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Like, so like, that's awesome.

504
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Yeah.

505
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Yeah.

506
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Oh, we like, oh, I stand up strong.

507
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Pripyat.

508
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Kind of like you got to beat it and, like, show me how strong you are kind of thing.

509
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Oh, I did that the other day.

510
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Oh, nonetheless.

511
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Yeah.

512
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
So he got up and he didn't cry.

513
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Of course he does.

514
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
He has a high ass fall to injury.

515
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
He landed correctly.

516
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
How many feet?

517
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Oh, like, it was taller than I stand.

518
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
So we're talking to seven feet.

519
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Like, seven.

520
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Six.

521
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Six.

522
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Six.

523
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Yeah.

524
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Okay.

525
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Over.

526
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Yeah.

527
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
It was, it was solid.

528
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Yeah.

529
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
But he landed good.

530
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Like, if he would have landed on his head, that's an injury straight up.

531
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Yeah.

532
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
But he, sure.

533
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
He felt like good, which is lucky.

534
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
But yeah, nonetheless.

535
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
So yeah.

536
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
If I were to, oh, gosh.

537
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Oh, it, like, ran over there or something like this.

538
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Oh, yeah.

539
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
It would have jammed him up.

540
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Oh, yeah.

541
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Isn't that why they airline pilots when you get turbulence?

542
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.50
They're like, hey, everybody just going and buckle your seat belts for, my feel a little

543
00:22:41.50 --> 00:22:44.50
bit more than, you know, instead of, hey guys, you know, we're going to repel

544
00:22:44.50 --> 00:22:45.50
that.

545
00:22:45.50 --> 00:22:46.50
We're going.

546
00:22:46.50 --> 00:22:47.50
Yeah.

547
00:22:47.50 --> 00:22:50.50
I very much appreciate that when we do that by the way.

548
00:22:50.50 --> 00:22:51.50
All right.

549
00:22:51.50 --> 00:22:52.50
So I ask questions.

550
00:22:52.50 --> 00:22:53.50
Next question.

551
00:22:53.50 --> 00:22:56.50
I tell the team, we need this done by three PM.

552
00:22:56.50 --> 00:22:58.000
They say, got it.

553
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.30
We'll have it done by three PM.

554
00:23:00.30 --> 00:23:05.000
But they don't do it every time and tell me, well, we didn't know we needed it done by

555
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
three PM.

556
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.50
How do I take ownership of this?

557
00:23:08.50 --> 00:23:09.50
Yeah.

558
00:23:09.50 --> 00:23:12.50
This seems like a tough question, right?

559
00:23:12.50 --> 00:23:16.50
But it's actually not that tough of a question.

560
00:23:16.50 --> 00:23:18.50
Because what you think is like, well, they say they were going to get it done, then

561
00:23:18.50 --> 00:23:21.50
then they didn't get it done, then how can that be my fault?

562
00:23:21.50 --> 00:23:24.50
And maybe that's not how the question is meant.

563
00:23:24.50 --> 00:23:28.50
But that's the way I'm interpreting it for the purpose of this answer.

564
00:23:28.50 --> 00:23:29.50
Sure.

565
00:23:29.50 --> 00:23:32.000
Because maybe you just meant like, hey, how do I take ownership of this?

566
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.50
And if that's the way you meant it fine, they answer the same actually.

567
00:23:34.50 --> 00:23:40.000
So what happens is, if if if it happens with what happens is, if that happens with your team,

568
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
then you take ownership of it by recognizing that you did not communicate effectively.

569
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.50
Because if your team isn't doing what it is you need them to do, that is actually your fault as the team leader.

570
00:23:49.50 --> 00:23:54.000
They either didn't understand how important it was, or they didn't understand how solid that deadline was.

571
00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.50
Or they didn't understand that when you said this thing needs to be completed by three o'clock,

572
00:24:00.50 --> 00:24:05.50
that you meant completed by three o'clock, maybe it's because you usually say, hey,

573
00:24:05.50 --> 00:24:09.50
we need this done tomorrow at two and you give them slack and they just kind of take advantage of it.

574
00:24:09.50 --> 00:24:11.000
blah blah blah blah.

575
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.50
Then, you know, if you want to take ownership of it,

576
00:24:13.50 --> 00:24:16.000
maybe you didn't follow up enough, right?

577
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Maybe you trusted them too much.

578
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Who's fault as if you trusted them so much that you just let them, you showed up at two,

579
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
fifty nine is it done? Well, no, we didn't think it was due, like we didn't know you needed it.

580
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Action.

581
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
So who's fault as that? It's your fault. You trusted them too much.

582
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Maybe you gave them too much leeway, right?

583
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Maybe you gave them too much leeway.

584
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Too much decentralized command.

585
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Dicotta, me leadership.

586
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Maybe you went too far with decentralized command. You said, hey, get this done by three o'clock.

587
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Figure out how everyone want to do it.

588
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
I'll be back at two, fifty nine and you roll out and it's not done.

589
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
So what do you do?

590
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
You come back at three o'clock.

591
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
It's not done. It is your fault.

592
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Do you take ownership of it? You say to your team, look, hey, okay, so how do you take ownership of it?

593
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Cool. You fix the problem. How do you fix the problem in this case?

594
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Well, guess what? Next time I tell you something's done at three o'clock,

595
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I'm going to check in with you.

596
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
I'm going to check in with you a few times.

597
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Here's the progress that we want to make.

598
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
I want you to be here by this point.

599
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
I want you to be here by this point.

600
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
I want you to be here by this point.

601
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
And that puts a soundtrack to finish well ahead of three o'clock.

602
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
So let's make it happen.

603
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Are you going to micromanage a little bit more? Yes, you are.

604
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
They missed a deadline. You're not allowed to miss deadlines.

605
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Not allowed to miss deadlines. Do I micromanage you echo trust?

606
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
No. Have you ever missed a deadline?

607
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
No.

608
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Well, there's been some podcasts that didn't come out on time.

609
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Right?

610
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Yeah, I guess they've been launched.

611
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
I guess, but yeah.

612
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
There's been some podcasts that didn't come out on time.

613
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Yes.

614
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
And I would send you a text like, hey, just wondering if you knew about a podcast that was, you know,

615
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
supposed to come out five hours ago.

616
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
That happened one time.

617
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Well, no, two times.

618
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
I think it's happened two times.

619
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Yeah.

620
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Yeah.

621
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
One of them.

622
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Yeah.

623
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
So you don't warrant micromanagement because you, we've done a hundred and forty seven podcasts.

624
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
And you've had two that were now on time.

625
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Do I need a micromanage you?

626
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
No, I don't.

627
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Don't need to.

628
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Because we're all good.

629
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
The podcast, hey, occasionally the times that they didn't come out.

630
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
One of them was like straight up operator error.

631
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Where you were like, I didn't press the button publisher, something really lame like that.

632
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Yeah.

633
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
The other time was like, major technical difficulty.

634
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
We got a problem.

635
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Yeah.

636
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
It's going to be a couple days.

637
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Yeah.

638
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Then there was another time.

639
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
What was the other time?

640
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
When we went to Maine the first last year.

641
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
And what happened?

642
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
We just got there on the night that I was supposed to publish it.

643
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
My mind was just distracted by the new.

644
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
I had lost my camera.

645
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
It was a crazy time for everybody.

646
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Yeah.

647
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
And, you know, the next morning, you so, you know,

648
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
graciously posted a picture of me sleeping on the plane.

649
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
By the way.

650
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
And said, maybe someone can do it.

651
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Could have published a podcast publicly, which is complete violation by the way.

652
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Yeah.

653
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Take picture of me sleeping.

654
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
But hey, the more having fun.

655
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Yeah.

656
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Yeah.

657
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
It was actually completely warranted because it really captured like what it felt like.

658
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
I just totally spaced it out.

659
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
So my point is you get stuff done on time.

660
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Yeah.

661
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
You have a good track record.

662
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
There's no need for micro management.

663
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
If you were, if you were hitting a lower number,

664
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
you know, if every, you know, once every once a month, it wasn't on time,

665
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
you'd be hearing about it all the time for me.

666
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
I'm like, hey, we good tomorrow.

667
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
We good.

668
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
I'd be checking in with you until you got so mad at me following up with you.

669
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
You would just be like, hey, I got this and you would never miss it again

670
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
because you didn't want to be bothered.

671
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
So for this one, again, it's important to remember that with the idea of extreme ownership.

672
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
It's not just like, oh, I'll say this is my fault.

673
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
No, when you're in charge of a team and something goes wrong,

674
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
it actually is your fault.

675
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
It actually is your fault.

676
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
And that's all there is to it.

677
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Maybe there's some people you need to fire because they are the,

678
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
they're at fault for this mistake happening and you've let it go too long and you didn't get rid of them.

679
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
That's your fault.

680
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Yeah.

681
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
But it actually is your fault.

682
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
How do you take on, how do you take on a ship of it?

683
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
You fix the problem.

684
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Maybe you got a, in this particular case,

685
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
maybe you got to step up the micro management.

686
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
That's, that's the way it works.

687
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Yeah, it makes sense.

688
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Also to the, well,

689
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000
I mean, I'm speaking from a perspective of someone who could very well easily space out this project by 3pm.

690
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
By the way, that's potentially me.

691
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
But this is, this is when it can happen,

692
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
where, let's say I get a list of like, two thing, three things, whatever, I got to do.

693
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Right.

694
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Okay, we, you know, we want this or whatever.

695
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
And then, let's say it's not necessarily by 3pm.

696
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Let's say it's like by next week Friday.

697
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
So I got, we can have to do these three things.

698
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
And then the next day, there's like another list of two things.

699
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Then the next day after that, one thing says, hey, you know what?

700
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
This is the priority three days later after this been established.

701
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Hey, this is the priority.

702
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Get this done first.

703
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Then you got one more thing.

704
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
All right.

705
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
So this thing that I said, yeah, got it.

706
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
I'll have it done by Friday kind of thing.

707
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Sort of get shuffled and forgot, you know, like,

708
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
forgotten.

709
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
So maybe I didn't organize it.

710
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
What's your point in saying this?

711
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
I just put yourself on report.

712
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Yeah.

713
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
And then that you need to make a list.

714
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Are you saying you need to write things down?

715
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
People that miss things, you know, you do your right.

716
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:08.000
I'm down.

717
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
I used to make little boxes.

718
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
I'll show you some of the checklist.

719
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
You come to my house.

720
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
I'll show you checklists.

721
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
I used to make there.

722
00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
They were psycho OCD.

723
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Little checklist.

724
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Little boxes next to like I would be going on a trip.

725
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
I would make a little box.

726
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Socks t-shirts.

727
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Oh, you know, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, everything.

728
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Every single thing I was taken.

729
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
I would have on a list.

730
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
I still got those.

731
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
I got to points from the 90s of what I took on the

732
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
and that's pretty legit right there.

733
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Little boxes, little boxes.

734
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
In the 90s, they were written down on paper.

735
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Then in the 2000s, I got that computer.

736
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Cool.

737
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
And I print those things out.

738
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
No.

739
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
So hey, yeah, people have problems.

740
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
If you personally are telling me that you have a problem,

741
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
you got to write something down.

742
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Yeah.

743
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
So, yeah.

744
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
And obviously, you know, mean you're different.

745
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
I don't know how those kind of notes.

746
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
But what I'm saying is,

747
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
uh, yeah, like that could be your methodology of your micro,

748
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
quote unquote micro management style for things like that.

749
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Well, for things like this, just make sure they got it kind of thing.

750
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Like if, for sure.

751
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Yeah, for sure.

752
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
The things I'm thinking about.

753
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
In fact, you can, you can give lists.

754
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
I normally wouldn't have to do this.

755
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
But sometimes there's been a couple times in my life and career.

756
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
What I'd have to give people a list.

757
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Like, hey, I think the box is for him.

758
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Like, hey, here's what you got to get done today.

759
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Yeah.

760
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Make sure we understand each other.

761
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
I would only do that if they drop the ball a couple times.

762
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Yeah.

763
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Like, oh, they didn't get this done.

764
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
They didn't get that done.

765
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Okay, guess what?

766
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
I need to write it down.

767
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Make sure it happens.

768
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
So yeah, and again, it's not like, and I'm not saying,

769
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
it's not my fault because you give me too much.

770
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
I'm not saying that.

771
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
I'm saying like, not everyone, me.

772
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
I'm talking about me.

773
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Not everyone's as organized as maybe you.

774
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
You know, so they're going to need some micro management in this particular way.

775
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
You know, maybe because maybe that's it.

776
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
I mean, I think the tone here, the question could be me.

777
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Totally could be me mystery.

778
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Yeah.

779
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
But it kind of seems like, hey, they said they got it.

780
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And they didn't get it.

781
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
What more do you want from me kind of thing?

782
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
You know, I think that's good.

783
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
We're putting it.

784
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
And then I just gave the list of what more you can do.

785
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Yeah, you can spell it out for them.

786
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000
You can micro manage.

787
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
You can check and do check ends with them.

788
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Do all those things.

789
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Yeah.

790
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
And then there you go.

791
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Next question.

792
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Next question.

793
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
You must have strong feelings about current events and politics.

794
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Generally, given your experience, yet you remain silent on this issue.

795
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Why?

796
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
To appeal to a larger audience, or the soldiers mentality of not criticizing the commander

797
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
in chief, is that why?

798
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Do I have strong feelings on current events and politics?

799
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Sure.

800
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
I do.

801
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
But they're more broad.

802
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
So I have very strong broad feelings on current events and politics.

803
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
I am a patriotic person.

804
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
I believe very strongly in individual freedoms of human beings.

805
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
I believe in having a very strong military.

806
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
I believe in having a small government.

807
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
So I have strong feelings about those things.

808
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:12.000
However, I don't have strong feelings about the nonsense and micro dramas that are on the 24-hour

809
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
news cycle that are just constant social media.

810
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Just constant things.

811
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
And we talked about this last podcast.

812
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Things that don't matter.

813
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:35.000
There's so much of the current events don't really matter in the big picture to me or even to the country.

814
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
And I was on Ben Shapirocho.

815
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
He was, I basically said, look, like, like, overall Americans have sort of the same goals.

816
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
And he said, I don't know if I believe that.

817
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And I said, well, I work with all kinds of companies with people all over the country.

818
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.000
And the people that I like Ben Shapiro, here's from, he's just, he's just bombarded by the

819
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
extremes on both sides 24 hours a day.

820
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
I don't want to be in that position of getting bombarded by these extremes 24 hours a day.

821
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
I said, Ben, you're right.

822
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
There are some people in the country that believe the far left or the far right.

823
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:24.000
I said, most people are concerned about their life and doing a good job and building their business or

824
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
you know, patting down their mortgage.

825
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
That's what they're concerned about.

826
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:39.000
And so they're not like freaking out about the little, every little micro drama that gets unleashed into the press and social media every single day.

827
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
And so, so why do I not join into that?

828
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Because I don't want to join into that.

829
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
And also, I don't want to make a podcast.

830
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
I don't want to spend all my time making a podcast that's out of date the day it comes out.

831
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
But I don't want to invest my time in that.

832
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
I don't want to.

833
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
And guess what?

834
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000
There's literally giant multi billion dollar news media outlets and guess what they do.

835
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
That's what they do all day.

836
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
That's what they do all day.

837
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
They make a story about this thing and that thing and this thing, I can't react fast enough.

838
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
It's just dumb.

839
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
So, if we were to be talking about current events, then by the time the podcast comes out, the current event has been over.

840
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Some people are listening to this podcast and it's it's 2000 and 22 right now.

841
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Right now, someone is listening to this podcast right now and it's 2022.

842
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
No, there's there's no topic of current events that we could talk about,

843
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Rare or Barely any that actually impact what's happening for years from now.

844
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
People, I meet people every day now.

845
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
I meet people that are that say, hey, oh man, I've been listening to podcasts.

846
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
I'm on 28.

847
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
That's that's two years ago, right?

848
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
That's two years ago.

849
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
What was the current events two years ago?

850
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
They were totally different than they are now.

851
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
So, so there's that.

852
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000
So that's why little current events thing as far as appealing to a larger audience that part of the question.

853
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Well, if my goal was to appeal to a larger audience, then I think I actually would talk about this.

854
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
I actually would talk about the trendy stories of the day and put out little little clips of sound bites of all this stuff.

855
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.000
And instead of instead of doing what I do now, which is to read a hundred year old out of print books.

856
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
But that's a great way to build an audience or let's talk about the Rwandan genocide.

857
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Let's talk about the Holocaust or let's talk about the rape and an king or let's talk about the me lie masker.

858
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
That ought to build a great audience.

859
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
So, so the idea that, oh, I'm trying to build a larger audience.

860
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
It's like, no, actually people that want to listen to this want to listen to it.

861
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000
I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to build an audience by manipulating what I'm thinking about.

862
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:55.000
No, I'm actually I'm talking about and I'm diving into what I find important and what I think I can learn from.

863
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
And I get more out of this podcast than anybody.

864
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
I mean, I know a lot of people say, oh, I've got a lot from your podcast.

865
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
I get more out of it than anybody because I get to dive deep into this stuff and

866
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
really look at it.

867
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
So, no, it's not they trying to appeal to a larger audience.

868
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
In fact, if I want a larger audience, I do exactly what you're talking about.

869
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
As far as the soldiers mentality of not criticizing the commander and chief,

870
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
if I actually don't agree, I don't agree that that's a soldiers mentality.

871
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
And I don't believe that it should be a soldiers mentality.

872
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
The soldier should question their leadership.

873
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
And now should they do it tactfully?

874
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Absolutely.

875
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Because I don't want to be surrounded by Yesman.

876
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
That's wrong.

877
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Also, if you, what am I trying, this is just a general leadership principle.

878
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
What have I said a thousand times on this podcast?

879
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000
I'm trying to build a relationship with a person above me and the chain of command.

880
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
So, when I was in the military, if I wanted to have influence over my boss,

881
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
over my commander and chief, what I outwardly criticize them and make them think, oh,

882
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
this guy just doesn't like me.

883
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
I'm going to take my first chance to get rid of them or not promote it.

884
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
No, I'm actually going to play the game.

885
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
And I'm going to look and say, okay, boss, hey, I see what you're doing here.

886
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
I want to support what you're doing, but does this make sense?

887
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Can we do it a different way?

888
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
So I'm trying to build a relationship with my boss up the chain of command.

889
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.000
I'm not trying to ostracize them by making them look bad or by openly criticizing my boss in,

890
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
in, you know, in the open.

891
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Because what have I done?

892
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Is my boss going to listen to me?

893
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
No.

894
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Actually, my boss is going to listen to me at all.

895
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
So I don't want to be surrounded by yes, man.

896
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
But at the same time, if someone's making a bad decision, if someone's doing something that's a moral or a legal,

897
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
I'll call him out on all day long.

898
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Now, the other thing that happens here is this is a new world and it's a buy.

899
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
And this is a binary world of sound bites.

900
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
That's what we've done.

901
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
We've created this binary world of sound bites.

902
00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:05.000
When most answers that you want to give as a human being aren't one sentence or two sentence on the far left or far right or far light or far dark.

903
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Like there's going to be, you have to explain things a little bit more.

904
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:18.000
And what when you take these binary sound bites, everyone's immediately thrown into an extreme category on the far left or the far right.

905
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
And it's soon.

906
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
And here's the bad part.

907
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Here's the really bad part.

908
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000
As soon as you get thrown into one of those camps, then the other camp stops listening to you completely.

909
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
They stop listening to you anything you say.

910
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
So you could you could make a great point.

911
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
But if you're on the other side, doesn't matter.

912
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
No one's listening.

913
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
They don't want to hear it.

914
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Because you're on the other side, you're the enemy.

915
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
It's a binary world.

916
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
You're either with me or against me and there's no in between.

917
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
So that's kind of what we've created.

918
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:57.000
And what I would rather do is have people actually listen to what I say broadly and make their own choices rather than me trying to force an opinion down their throat.

919
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
This is the way it is.

920
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
This is the way it should be.

921
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
And by the way, just like leadership, you can't force people.

922
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
You can't force an opinion down someone throat.

923
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
You can't.

924
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
You can't.

925
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
It'll work for 30 seconds.

926
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
It'll work for five minutes and it'll work for five days and leadership's isn't yet.

927
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
You better do what I say.

928
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
My way is right.

929
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Eventually, you that kind of leadership does not work.

930
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
And it's the same thing with trying to force an opinion down someone's throat throat.

931
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
If you listen to what I'm saying, you can form your own opinion.

932
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
And I would rather have you do that because that's going to be stronger than some opinion that I tried to force down your throat.

933
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Which doesn't work by the way.

934
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:43.000
So I would rather people listen to me and not just sound bikes and see where I'm coming from holistically and see where they can agree and disagree and see what feedback they give me.

935
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Because by the way, I could be wrong about something which I have no problem with.

936
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
But I would rather do that.

937
00:39:49.000 --> 00:40:01.000
I would rather have that approach than join the pack, whichever pack that is joined the pack on the street and bark loudly like the rest of the dogs.

938
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
I have no interest in doing that.

939
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
So there you go.

940
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Okay.

941
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Thank you, girl.

942
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Yeah. And it's funny, man.

943
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
You're like one of the few people who, I mean, I, you know, like that.

944
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Hold to me to sum that up.

945
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
I mean, I've heard that before or where someone would be like, hey, I'm, you know, I'm like this one.

946
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:31.000
But it's so very, it's so few people that actually do that the way the way you do even in real life, like in real life.

947
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Like you, you don't even want political stuff will come up.

948
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
It's real obvious that you didn't jump into any specific group.

949
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.000
So well, this, this really ties back to last week's podcast of getting involved in things that don't matter.

950
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
And there is, there is just so much out there that doesn't matter.

951
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Now, where you have to be careful is that that, that there's so many things that don't matter.

952
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
But what I am not saying that little things don't matter.

953
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
You see what I'm saying?

954
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
There's a huge disparity between those two things.

955
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000
A lot of things that don't matter. What I am not saying is that little things don't matter.

956
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Because there are little things that do matter.

957
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000
And the classic example that we brought up over and over again on this podcast is like, oh, the Russian soldiers not shaving in Chechnya.

958
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
And how that led to their, eventually, okay, not going to shave.

959
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Now we're not going to clean our weapons now, but now we're not going to stay awake on a watch.

960
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Now we're not going to execute the missions we're being told to do now we're getting beat.

961
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
There are little things that matter.

962
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
If I'm barking all day long about things that don't matter, then we have a problem.

963
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
We have a problem. Now I'll tell you something else.

964
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
There's been some issues that have come up lately.

965
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
There is one issue that I was going to address on the podcast, but

966
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:54.000
And I still might address it because it's a small problem that I see as being a more significant problem.

967
00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
And if it continues down the road, but luckily, at this point,

968
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
there's there's a whole pack of dogs barking about it.

969
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
It wasn't like, it wasn't like I noticed this problem, no one else saw it.

970
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
It was like I noticed this problem, so did millions of other people.

971
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
And they all those dogs start barking. Okay, so now what am I going to do?

972
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:24.000
It's a park with them. It's like, okay, now if there comes a time where all of a sudden I realize there's one of these small things that matter or a big things that matter.

973
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
That I don't see getting the traction that it needs.

974
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Well, then I will absolutely say, hey, this is what I think about this situation.

975
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Generally, there's so many people barking.

976
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
And they're barking about the same thing. They're barking about a lot of things that don't matter.

977
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
They're barking about some things that matter.

978
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
And right now, unless I mean, what do I say all the time, unless you speak to more people listen?

979
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Yeah. So if I want to give my opinion on the daily news every hour on the hour, no one's listening to anything I've got to say.

980
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
And then it's a waste. It's a waste of my time because there's more important things.

981
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:14.000
When we can when we can dive into human nature through the lens of war, through the lens of leadership through the war of a trust, if we can learn and teach people about the past so that we can prevent it from happening in the future.

982
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:22.000
That to me is infinitely more impactful than barking about some current event that's happening that's going to be gone in a week.

983
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
It's amazing how fast stuff comes up on the raiders.

984
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
All of the headlines and in a week it's gone in a week it's gone.

985
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Yeah.

986
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
So I'm just not going to play that game. I don't.

987
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
There's no point in doing it.

988
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:48.000
That's a really good way to put it. It's like these current events. Most of the time seem to be shaped in a way to just for dogs to bark about.

989
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
You know, like that's what it is. I can't.

990
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
And then they bark in the next thing.

991
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
You know, yeah. Okay, bark about this now.

992
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
The sound bite thing is really interesting too.

993
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
The everything is a sound bite and it either puts you in one camper or the other camp.

994
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
And the fact of the matter is you can't put me in a camp.

995
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000
You can't because I got beliefs that you don't understand on one side on the other side.

996
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Yeah.

997
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
You know, and so you can't talk to me about that kind of thing.

998
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
You can't, not that you can't talk. You can't put me in a camp.

999
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000
But the instinct of the world right now is take that person and put him in a camp.

1000
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
I'm not going in the camp. That's what's happening.

1001
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
If you want to figure out what I'm thinking, listen, what I'm saying about,

1002
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Listen to what I'm saying in hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours

1003
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
where I talk about human nature, right?

1004
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
If you want to figure that out and then you want to ask me a point of question about something cool.

1005
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Ask it. Bring it.

1006
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
If it's something that's going to be food.

1007
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
If it's a bark, if you want me to bark about something, I'm probably not going to bark about it.

1008
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
So what?

1009
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Throwing you in a camp, all you'd have is a whole lot of unhappy campers?

1010
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
No, you throw me in a camp.

1011
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
If you put me in one camp, the other camp doesn't listen anymore.

1012
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
And that means their minds are closed, so they're not going to...

1013
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000
And the fact the matter is, there's good people in both camps.

1014
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:19.000
And both people can be... can change and can accept new ideas.

1015
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
If their mind is open, if their mind is open, they're just staying there camp.

1016
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
And everyone else, I mean, when you watch the extremes of either camp right now,

1017
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
it's like, it's like really? It's... it's bizarre a world.

1018
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Yeah, it's kind of odd.

1019
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
So you just sit there and say, okay, why am I going to play that game?

1020
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Let's just become better people that understand people better and will make better.

1021
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
I would make the place, make the world better.

1022
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Can't disagree.

1023
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Yeah, the whole unhappy campers, those mean more making a joke?

1024
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
I did it.

1025
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Yeah, I know.

1026
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Yeah, I was good attempted humor.

1027
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Well, I actually know it wasn't.

1028
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
There's a failure, but that's cool.

1029
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
What was the other point you made?

1030
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Sometimes it's better to just try, you know?

1031
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:03.000
And...

1032
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Oh, they would have...

1033
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1034
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:07.000
See what up, now I know.

1035
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
No, no, you know, don't try that again.

1036
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
No more jokes from that control.

1037
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
I'm going to learn from it.

1038
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Might mistake.

1039
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Anyway, next question.

1040
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
What is the best way to break through a plateau in juditsu?

1041
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
I'm stuck doing the same moves against the same training point as it has the same moves done to me.

1042
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Beating the same guys and getting beat by the same guys.

1043
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
What should I do?

1044
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
What should I do?

1045
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Well, I'll tell you what I would do.

1046
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Going a crazy training bench.

1047
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Yeah.

1048
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Take a week off from work and train eight hours a day.

1049
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Just get crazy.

1050
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Make sure you're healthy and then take a week off and train eight hours a day.

1051
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Like nuts.

1052
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
That's number one.

1053
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Number two, you could also opposite.

1054
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Take a short break.

1055
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Take a little time.

1056
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Don't take a long break.

1057
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Take a little step back.

1058
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
That's another option.

1059
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Another option is only start working on certain moves.

1060
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Like only utilize one.

1061
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Like, okay, so every time you get arm lock from the bottom of you, you got to be your guard player.

1062
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Don't play guard anymore.

1063
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Don't play guard anymore.

1064
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Start just look, I'm not going to play guard every time I'm going to come up and I'm going to get this.

1065
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
I'm going to go for a single leg from the bottom.

1066
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Like Dean does.

1067
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
I'm going to do that every time until I start making a work, that's what I'm going to do.

1068
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
And if I get choked a thousand times, that's fine because I'm going to get better out of

1069
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Eventually.

1070
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
And the other thing is train like, you know, you get your little click of training partners at

1071
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
your gym, start training with some of the other people that have different body styles and

1072
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
different body shapes.

1073
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
So you get used to, you have to bring out a new part of your game.

1074
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
The first one that I talked about, training bench eight hours a day.

1075
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
I know it's hard for people to actually make that happen.

1076
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
It's not perfect.

1077
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.000
The times that I've done that, the first time I did it, I actually do it at the time that I taught the

1078
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:03.000
the jacco, the jit-jit for offense, the jit-jitsu offense for combat killing operations.

1079
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
The jacco course.

1080
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
And I trained these guys.

1081
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
It was a small group.

1082
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
It was like five of us.

1083
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000
And we trained all day.

1084
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
And one of the guys was equivalent to me.

1085
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Dan, he was like, we were both like blue belts.

1086
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
And so we, not only were teaching people, but we were training long.

1087
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000
And like my jit-jitsu visibly got better in a five day period.

1088
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Because I trained super hard for five straight is.

1089
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000
So that's a cool way.

1090
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
You could probably do it for a weekend.

1091
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
You know, probably just got three take a Friday off, train Friday Saturday, Sunday,

1092
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
eight hours a day.

1093
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
We're going some stuff.

1094
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Yeah.

1095
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Be careful when you know, because you get your overuse injuries and order,

1096
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
you get when you're tired, you're more likely to get hurt.

1097
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
So you got to use a little caution.

1098
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
But those are some good ways to break your platos in jit-jitsu,

1099
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
which we all, we all hit.

1100
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Yeah.

1101
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
One way to know that you're breaking your platos,

1102
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000
you're going to get worse first.

1103
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
You're going to get, you're going to lose.

1104
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
You're going to lose to some of these guys that you have been tapping.

1105
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
You're trying something new.

1106
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Yeah.

1107
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Yeah.

1108
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
That is indicator for sure.

1109
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000
I like the do certain moves or omit certain moves.

1110
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Because like, it's a natural thing where like you,

1111
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
when you're, when you're ascending, right?

1112
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
When you're, when you're training,

1113
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
you kind of settle into a certain type of game.

1114
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
You know, so maybe yeah, you like to play guard a lot.

1115
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Maybe like to get the triangle from the guard a lot.

1116
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
That's your kind of go-to, you know?

1117
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Where it all, it becomes sort of this almost like a muscle memory kind of thing.

1118
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Where it's like boom, you'll pull guard, you're routine in a row,

1119
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
no matter who you're going against.

1120
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
It's kind of real similar all the time.

1121
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Right?

1122
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
So yeah, if you start omitting that stuff,

1123
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
where's like, okay, I'm not,

1124
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
I won't go for that triangle anymore.

1125
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
I'll play guard, but it cannot do the triangle,

1126
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
so it forces you to do other stuff.

1127
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
And then sometimes depending on your experience,

1128
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
you might have two, three, four go-toes, right?

1129
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
So you still, you're still kind of trapped in that same plateau

1130
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
but if you just omit one move.

1131
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000
So in that case, you think of a move that you might notice

1132
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
other people getting a lot, not necessarily on you,

1133
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
but you know, just in general, and be like,

1134
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000
hey, that's all I'm gonna do.

1135
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
I can't get any other submission.

1136
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
I can't.

1137
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
I can only do, I don't know, the guillotine, for example.

1138
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Right? Let's say you, you just don't do guillotines that much,

1139
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
or whatever.

1140
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000
I know you can't relate to that.

1141
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
But you say, okay, I'm only going for guillotine.

1142
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
If I'm like in my guard, I can't really, like,

1143
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
I can't really get a guillotine from the guard or whatever.

1144
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000
And put it this way if you're not good at guillotines.

1145
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000
That'll force you to find ways to get a guillotine.

1146
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000
It'll force you.

1147
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
And then if you do that for,

1148
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000
why don't we out say maybe even like three months,

1149
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
maybe in six months, Brian Sergeant was like, hey,

1150
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000
yeah, like what I did?

1151
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Like, because he likes to plant up,

1152
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
smash from the top.

1153
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
He's like, I didn't just, for six months,

1154
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
I just didn't plant up.

1155
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Mm-hmm.

1156
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Well, that might have been you.

1157
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
I said that.

1158
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:47.000
I don't know.

1159
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Why don't you guys said that?

1160
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
That definitely happened with me.

1161
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Yeah.

1162
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
It definitely happened with me.

1163
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
I didn't like being on the bottom.

1164
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Yeah.

1165
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000
And then I just, this is like, okay.

1166
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Yeah.

1167
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
No sweeps allowed.

1168
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000
No, like, starting from the top.

1169
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
If you're, if you're starting, you pull guard.

1170
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
That's it.

1171
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Like, no, that's your rule.

1172
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
And that's the thing.

1173
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
It's hard to, like,

1174
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
it's hard to come to training.

1175
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Unless you have this plan in your mind set.

1176
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
It's hard to come to training.

1177
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Be like, you know what?

1178
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
I think I'm going to just only play guard today

1179
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
if, like, you don't like guard.

1180
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Mm-hmm.

1181
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Because it's like, I don't want to get, like,

1182
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
tapped out for everybody, you know?

1183
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Especially when you just got your purple belt.

1184
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Yeah.

1185
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
You know, or something like this?

1186
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
It's hard to do that.

1187
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
But yeah, if you just make up your mind,

1188
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
kind of think of it long term,

1189
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
like I'm playing the long game here,

1190
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
and just only go for that certain move that you want to get.

1191
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
That's all you're doing.

1192
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
It'll, that'll bust.

1193
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
You put, put, pass the plateau easy.

1194
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
It'll, I don't know about easy.

1195
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Well, it's a good way to work through your plateau.

1196
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
But I think that's a very high probability

1197
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
that you'll, you'll get past it.

1198
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Yeah, yeah.

1199
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
And also, uh, just not easy.

1200
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
No, no, no, no, no.

1201
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Cause you just have to work your plateau easy.

1202
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000
It's not easy.

1203
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Yeah, but it's actually hard.

1204
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1205
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Okay.

1206
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
And I just don't, I just want to make sure

1207
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000
people aren't like, oh, you know,

1208
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Echo said to just try one move,

1209
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000
and then it's going to be easy to break the note.

1210
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Yeah, that's actually not true.

1211
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Yeah.

1212
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
It's actually hard.

1213
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000
It's, it's hard to not just resort back to what you're good at.

1214
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
And be when you don't resort to what you're good at,

1215
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
you get your ass kicked on a regular basis, which is not fun.

1216
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Yeah.

1217
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
So it's easy.

1218
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Yeah.

1219
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000
And that easily could be the two main challenges of

1220
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
going through due to journeys.

1221
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Those two things.

1222
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Yeah.

1223
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Arguably.

1224
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Yes, you're right.

1225
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Correct.

1226
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000
That is absolutely correct.

1227
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000
If that's what you mean by easy.

1228
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
What a kind of sort of meant was.

1229
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Yeah.

1230
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
The properly breaking past the surf spot that I surf at.

1231
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Yes.

1232
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000
And one of the ways to get out of the water is dangerous,

1233
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
but fast.

1234
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000
The other way to get out of the water is mellow,

1235
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
but it's a longer walk.

1236
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
And I was surfing with my buddy,

1237
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Stoner.

1238
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
And he's like,

1239
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Hey, which way is it easier to get out?

1240
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
And I said, well, bro, depends on which way.

1241
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000
It's easier to be easy.

1242
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
If you mean me, you need to get out there.

1243
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Because one of them is not more than a few steps once you're good.

1244
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Yeah.

1245
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000
But getting good is getting to that point is a challenge.

1246
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
The other way is really easy, but it's a long walk.

1247
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000
So it just depends on which you mean my easy.

1248
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Yeah.

1249
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Yeah.

1250
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
So I mean to me.

1251
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Probability wise.

1252
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Let's say if you chose to break through your plateau,

1253
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
by going to another gym to train with all different guys.

1254
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
That would get your plateau.

1255
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000
But I think if you did this thing where you owe me a certain move,

1256
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
or you just add a move they're not good,

1257
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
and that's only what if you did that and really committed to it,

1258
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
correctly, which is hard.

1259
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
By the way, mentally, but if you did that,

1260
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000
I think the probability of you breaking past your plateau

1261
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000
and ending up at a further place in regards to progress

1262
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
is much higher if you did that.

1263
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Yeah.

1264
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
That's what I think.

1265
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
And that's what I meant by easy, which I guess.

1266
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Yeah.

1267
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
To show you, you use the word easy.

1268
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Depends what you mean by easy.

1269
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000
You can also do tournaments, planning.

1270
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000
If you do a lot of tournaments, you'll bust past the plateau.

1271
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Yeah.

1272
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Weaknesses will be exposed.

1273
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Yeah.

1274
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
And it's like, your mind will be way more eddies in training too.

1275
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
It'll be like more, oh, yes, weird.

1276
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000
For sure.

1277
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000
I think so.

1278
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Anyway, next question.

1279
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000
How do you apply the principle of building a relationship with your boss

1280
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000
when your boss doesn't value relationships?

1281
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
For example, he consistently avoids interactions that don't lead directly to a deliverable

1282
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000
on a current objective.

1283
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000
He avoids all other interactions such as those that are for the purpose of building

1284
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
relationships and chemistry within the team.

1285
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Okay.

1286
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
What would I do in that situation?

1287
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Well, then, okay, obviously, what I would do is I would build a relationship based on deliverable

1288
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
current objectives.

1289
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Right?

1290
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000
If that's what he's into, I'm going to make that happen.

1291
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Like, I'm going to be the guy that he thinks can get this to happen.

1292
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
And that's what our relationship is going to be based on.

1293
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000
And I'm fine with that when he wants to talk about work, I'll talk about work.

1294
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000
I had bosses like that.

1295
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
I had plenty of bosses like that.

1296
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000
And what do you do when you have bosses like that and play the game?

1297
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Like, okay, we're going to, let's just make this happen.

1298
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Let's do this.

1299
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Now, let me say this.

1300
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Because he isn't personable.

1301
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
This means that you have to be more personable, not somewhat with him,

1302
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:31.000
but with the rest of the team, because there's a lacking element within the team that you as a good

1303
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:38.000
team player and team member and leader, whether you're in a positional leadership or just a human leader,

1304
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:45.000
you can improve the team by building some of that human connection that bonds the team more.

1305
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:53.000
So, even though my boss is impersonable and is just about the business and just about the current objective,

1306
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
that's fine with me.

1307
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:01.000
I'm going to do my best to support him and make him realize that I'm going to got the guy that's going to make those objectives work.

1308
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000
And I'm going to build the human connection with the rest of the team, which will make our team stronger.

1309
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Now, I'm not going to offend my boss by being the guy that is more popular than him.

1310
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Some people have some people that have the attitude that this individuals talking about,

1311
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
what would you call this person?

1312
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Just like 100% work focused.

1313
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:31.000
If I got a guy that's 100% work focused, sometimes that kind of boss finds the person that wants to chat,

1314
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
annoying, right?

1315
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Unknowing, which is possible.

1316
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000
So, you don't want to be, you don't want to annoy the boss and he thinks all this,

1317
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000
all this guy, Joggoy just wants to build friends. He's not here to work.

1318
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
No, you've got to be careful about that.

1319
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000
And the weird thing is, honestly, I'm very work focused.

1320
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
I'm very work focused.

1321
00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
And I have to do more, but I just think I have to consciously think about, okay, on top of it.

1322
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Actually, I still do have to do it sometimes.

1323
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000
You know, like, I have to consciously think about, like, okay, I also need to like,

1324
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000
be nice and build relationship with the person that I've don't.

1325
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Normally interact with, right?

1326
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000
So, you do have to do that.

1327
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:25.000
So, from the relationship with the rest of the team, the good relationship, and then from the best relationship that you can with the boss,

1328
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000
and that is going to help the whole team. That's it. It's as simple as that.

1329
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000
And I'll say one more thing about this.

1330
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
You don't get to pick your leader.

1331
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Generally, you don't get to pick your leader.

1332
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000
But you can pick the relationship that you have with your leader.

1333
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000
So, what your leaders into? Let's get in the game. Let's build a good relationship.

1334
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Once again, if someone's out there thinking, oh, so you just want me to kiss ass.

1335
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
What I'm saying is not that I want you to kiss ass.

1336
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000
I'm saying I want you to win. That's what I'm saying.

1337
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Because the better relationship you build with your boss, the more influence you have over the better chance you have of getting promoted,

1338
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000
the better chance you have of accomplices in the mission and taking care of your team.

1339
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
That's the way it works. Why don't you want to get promoted?

1340
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
So, I can get more money from myself. No, I want to get promoted.

1341
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.000
So, I can do the mission. So, I can take care of my team. That's why I want to get promoted.

1342
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:21.000
If it was just about like taking care of myself, I wouldn't go work for this guy.

1343
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
I'd go find another job and pick a different boss.

1344
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Because you do get to pick your boss. You can quit your job.

1345
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Quit your day job.

1346
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000
So, that's what you do. You build that relationship.

1347
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000
How does it is? Get some.

1348
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Yeah, that's a good point with the details of it.

1349
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
You can't just start trying to chat the guy up.

1350
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
No, it's not. You just like that.

1351
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Yeah, no one does actually. Even if you're a social person,

1352
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000
but you're just focused on something.

1353
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Yeah.

1354
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000
And, I don't know. You're focusing on your friend calls you.

1355
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
They call me, it might be important.

1356
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Me, you're talking.

1357
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Yeah, and they're telling you about the episode of whatever last night.

1358
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
And you're like, Brad, I'm working right now.

1359
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Brad and watch TV.

1360
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Yeah.

1361
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Oh, yeah.

1362
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Now you're going to step further than I had in my book.

1363
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
I'm just saying that that's annoying no matter who you are.

1364
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.000
So, if you're thinking, you know, this boss is like he doesn't like the quote unquote build

1365
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Build relationship and like all the stuff.

1366
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000
He's only then you're going to, you run that risk of annoying him.

1367
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Yes, you can be a sister.

1368
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
You got a big step back to my economy.

1369
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000
That kind of thing.

1370
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
But there's little, and usually it has to do with time too.

1371
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:32.000
You know, so if you go in and you just go just little digs of like relationship building stuff,

1372
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
but not don't take, don't go in there and be like, hey,

1373
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000
did you catch the game last night?

1374
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Yeah, I don't want to talk about it.

1375
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000
I don't want to talk about it.

1376
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000
I don't care.

1377
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
But, you know, I don't know.

1378
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Nice tie.

1379
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Boom, out.

1380
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000
You know, kind of big.

1381
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000
I don't know.

1382
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Don't say nice tie.

1383
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000
No, don't.

1384
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Next question.

1385
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.000
The guy that's high level worker does not want to hear about his tie.

1386
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
It's not care about his tie.

1387
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Yeah.

1388
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000
A lot of people.

1389
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000
But yeah, and I don't know how to get in the corporate scenario.

1390
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I think my whole life, but.

1391
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
So I don't know that I just seem like something on the move.

1392
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
It's a long thing about your shirt.

1393
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
That wasn't corporate.

1394
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
That was a big club.

1395
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
But yeah.

1396
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Leadership.

1397
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Yeah, same cut for sure.

1398
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And the point is there's things you can say that don't take up his time and necessarily

1399
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
his full attention to annoy him that you can say or do.

1400
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
It's what I'm saying.

1401
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I don't know what that is because I don't.

1402
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I don't.

1403
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I don't work with you guys.

1404
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Check.

1405
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Next question.

1406
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Hey, Jockel.

1407
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
My boss is trying to implement, let's say boss.

1408
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Let's say, boss.

1409
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I don't know why it's it's highlighting.

1410
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Oh, my boss is.

1411
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
So.

1412
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Where it works, man.

1413
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Somebody was talking about on social media.

1414
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
How you said, peace.

1415
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
You're like, I went to the grocery store.

1416
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I got some peace.

1417
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
So, you know.

1418
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
It's a, you know, variable.

1419
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I don't know.

1420
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I see that.

1421
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Not the variable escalation.

1422
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Sure.

1423
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.000
My boss is trying to implement a process that I see the end result not being what is needed.

1424
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And I have proposed an alternative that is proven and will add value to the company.

1425
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Do I give up trying to position to get the outcome we need or do I commit to help

1426
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000
implement his process and wait for outcome then trying it?

1427
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It is a relatively small failure in the big picture outcome, but would like some input on how

1428
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
to get the results we need long term.

1429
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Very cool question.

1430
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And so, yeah, you got a scenario where your boss wants to do something.

1431
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
You know you got a better idea that'll work better.

1432
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
What do you do?

1433
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Well, first of all, anyway, that I can make my idea and his idea, that's what I'm going to try

1434
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
and do.

1435
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
So, you have to be careful.

1436
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And again, I don't know what your boss might be an open minded person.

1437
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
If you've got a good leader, you can go there and say, hey, boss is what you're trying

1438
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
to make happen.

1439
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I think this will work better and your boss make, oh, wow, that's a great idea.

1440
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You know what?

1441
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Let's go with that.

1442
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
There's leaders like there out there that make it happen.

1443
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
You're probably not asking this question if you have that kind of boss.

1444
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
You're probably talking about someone that has a little bit more ego.

1445
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Things they know a little bit more and not really open minded to new ideas.

1446
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And that's why making your idea and his idea is going to be a better option.

1447
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Don't try and force your idea.

1448
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000
And one thing you do is you could ask questions and I've talked about this before, but like,

1449
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
you say something like, you know, hey, boss, I want to make sure that I'm supporting this in the best way possible.

1450
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
So, I really want to understand this fully.

1451
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So, can you explain this here to me and why we're doing it like that?

1452
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And then you know you have a conversation with your boss and then you go, oh,

1453
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and maybe your boss has some good points that you didn't understand or maybe that opens the door

1454
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
for you to say, hey, boss, the way that this other group is doing it is like this.

1455
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Do you think we could try that?

1456
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Or you say, if you want to ego him up a little bit, like, hey, boss, you know, I don't,

1457
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
boss, you know, I don't, I don't fully understand this, you know, as well as you do,

1458
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
could you just help me understand why we're doing it this way?

1459
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And then once again, what you're doing is you're starting a conversation.

1460
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000
If you can't get the message across in that indirect manner,

1461
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000
you can be a little bit more direct, but be careful when you're direct with people.

1462
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
They dig in, man.

1463
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
They dig in, especially with anyone with any kind of ego.

1464
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
You go, they dig in.

1465
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
You tell them your idea and they just, all of a sudden, they come up with reasons not to,

1466
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
do it and you have to be careful.

1467
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
That's why you have to use caution when you reveal your plan.

1468
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It's better to not even reveal it as your plan.

1469
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
It's better to reveal it as like an idea and then let it become their plan.

1470
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Don't reveal your emotions.

1471
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Okay, now all that fails.

1472
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
This guy's just dead set.

1473
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Hey, we're doing it my way.

1474
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Shut up echo.

1475
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
We're not listening to your plan.

1476
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
We're doing it my way.

1477
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Then what you do?

1478
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Yeah, you go all in.

1479
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
What about the best, the best ability you, you try and learn what they want,

1480
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
you try and execute what they want, you try and understand what they want better than anyone else including him.

1481
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So that way you go out, you execute, you know where all the weaknesses are.

1482
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Now you learn and now you can come back with a better argument,

1483
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
or a better seeded plan in their head, hey boss, I know your plan.

1484
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
It's working really, really well and one thing that we could do to make it even better.

1485
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:17.28
better. I think what do you think of this if we did XYZ instead of XYB? I think it might work

1486
01:04:17.28 --> 01:04:23.60
a little bit better. What do you think? And then you, again, you plant this, you plant the team.

1487
01:04:23.60 --> 01:04:27.12
And maybe, I mean, you plant the seed. And maybe you can incorporate, you know, there's times

1488
01:04:27.12 --> 01:04:30.80
where there's times where I did this. Oh, that's what you want to do, boss. Cool. God, yep,

1489
01:04:30.80 --> 01:04:35.20
that's what we're going to do. Going to do something. Same result, get the same result but do it

1490
01:04:35.20 --> 01:04:42.16
a different way. You know, it's the ask for better to ask for forgiveness than per mesh. Yeah,

1491
01:04:42.16 --> 01:04:47.12
than per mesh. So sometimes it's like, it's like the again, we're going back to the idea of things

1492
01:04:47.12 --> 01:04:51.36
that don't matter. If my boss wants me to do it one way and I can do it just a little bit different

1493
01:04:51.36 --> 01:04:55.28
and no one's going to know and it's going to be all good and our results going to be the better or

1494
01:04:55.28 --> 01:04:59.76
the same. I'm probably just going to be like, hey, boss, I got it. And then hey, boss, yeah, on the fly,

1495
01:04:59.76 --> 01:05:06.48
we made a little call here. We went with a, y, b or Z, d, a instead of Z, d, b. I hope it's not, you know,

1496
01:05:06.48 --> 01:05:10.40
bad, but here's the results, by the way, we did it an even shorter time. And the boss goes, oh, yeah,

1497
01:05:10.40 --> 01:05:14.08
that's cool. There's no big deal because he sees the results. He wants to take a little bit

1498
01:05:14.08 --> 01:05:22.56
credit forms. So again, once this about this is about building the relationship. So let me ask you this.

1499
01:05:22.56 --> 01:05:31.84
This is, this is an important, a good question to ask yourself. Will, what will help the team more?

1500
01:05:32.72 --> 01:05:38.64
What will help the team more? Will it help the team more to disrupt the relationship and undermine the boss?

1501
01:05:40.08 --> 01:05:45.84
Will that, will that help the team? No. Will it help the team if you create an antagonistic relationship

1502
01:05:45.84 --> 01:05:51.12
with your boss? No, that won't help your team. Will it help your team if you build the relationship

1503
01:05:51.12 --> 01:05:55.84
with your boss if you unify the team? If you strengthen the team and you bring everyone together,

1504
01:05:55.84 --> 01:05:59.20
will that help the team? Yes, it will help the team. Will that build the relationship with your boss?

1505
01:05:59.20 --> 01:06:02.56
Yes, it will build the relationship with your boss. If you have a better relationship with your boss,

1506
01:06:02.56 --> 01:06:09.20
is your boss more likely to accept the influence that you're throwing at him? Yes, absolutely.

1507
01:06:10.32 --> 01:06:16.72
So I think that's something you can ask yourself a lot. Is what I am trying to do

1508
01:06:16.72 --> 01:06:21.84
you're going to help the team or her to team and you actually have to look at those two in the long term in the

1509
01:06:21.84 --> 01:06:25.84
short term. Because sometimes you do something that hurts the team right now. It'll help the team later.

1510
01:06:25.84 --> 01:06:31.04
Like for instance, hey, we're going to fire a guy. Everyone loves him, but it's going to disrupt the team,

1511
01:06:31.04 --> 01:06:36.56
but long term will be better off. Sometimes that works. Sometimes it's like we're going to fire this guy,

1512
01:06:36.88 --> 01:06:40.88
everyone loves him and it's going to be a long term down. It's going to be a long term detriment

1513
01:06:40.88 --> 01:06:45.92
that you made this call. So you have to check yourself and check what's going to help the long term

1514
01:06:45.92 --> 01:06:49.76
short term of the team is going to make it better. It's going to make it worse. In this case,

1515
01:06:50.64 --> 01:06:57.44
try to make your plan your boss's plan. If you can't, then support build relationships and influence

1516
01:06:57.44 --> 01:07:01.92
over the long term, especially because this guy very smart to mention that this is a relatively

1517
01:07:01.92 --> 01:07:07.36
small failure. Like this is an acute risk. You can, hey boss, you know what, we got it done,

1518
01:07:07.36 --> 01:07:11.36
didn't quite got to come the same way. Here's what we're going. So very good question.

1519
01:07:11.36 --> 01:07:18.88
Interesting. Next question. Similar question. Yeah, this is why I grew this one together.

1520
01:07:18.88 --> 01:07:23.68
We had a couple of grouped questions. This is one of them. Jockel, I was wondering what your advice

1521
01:07:23.68 --> 01:07:28.64
is for disagreeing up the chain of command. Obviously, this needs to be done with some

1522
01:07:28.64 --> 01:07:33.52
tact, IE in private, not in front of others, but in those private conversations, how should one

1523
01:07:33.52 --> 01:07:39.68
respectfully disagree? Again, this again, similar question, a better technique than disagreeing,

1524
01:07:39.68 --> 01:07:43.68
it's just to ask questions. You know, boss, hey, I want to make sure I get this right. Can

1525
01:07:43.68 --> 01:07:48.64
you explain it to me again? Can you watch me do it? Right? So your boss actually sees what the

1526
01:07:48.64 --> 01:07:55.44
problem is. That way, you're not being offensive. Hey, boss, can you explain why you chose this

1527
01:07:55.44 --> 01:07:59.20
course of action? I really want to learn from what you do, the way you do it.

1528
01:08:04.08 --> 01:08:09.12
I, again, does that sound like a kiss ass? Yes, because I'm exaggerating. You know what I mean? Hey,

1529
01:08:09.12 --> 01:08:13.52
boss, you're so incredibly smart. No, I'm not talking about that because bosses don't like

1530
01:08:13.52 --> 01:08:19.92
kiss ass kisses. At least good bosses. Good bosses don't. And actually, even good bosses,

1531
01:08:19.92 --> 01:08:24.32
they might keep their kiss asses around, but they don't respect them. So you don't gain influence

1532
01:08:24.32 --> 01:08:28.72
by being a kiss ass. It's not a good situation. So I'm not talking about kissing ass, but you know,

1533
01:08:28.72 --> 01:08:33.20
hey, boss, I'm really want to understand this and make sure I understand it. Can you, can you

1534
01:08:33.20 --> 01:08:38.40
explain to me why this is the best way to make this to do this versus the other way? You know,

1535
01:08:38.40 --> 01:08:41.76
that's the kind of question. That's not kiss ass. That's actually, you know, it is actually

1536
01:08:41.76 --> 01:08:46.48
legitimately wanting to know. Well, like I legitimately want to know, maybe, you know, what if we

1537
01:08:46.48 --> 01:08:49.68
instead of assuming that we know better than our boss? What if we assume that my boss knows better

1538
01:08:49.68 --> 01:08:53.04
than me? Let's make that assumption. And if you communicate with that assumption,

1539
01:08:53.68 --> 01:08:56.88
then you're probably going to communicate in a much better way than communicating with

1540
01:08:56.88 --> 01:09:01.20
these assumption that my boss is nitty at 9 o'clock, which is not a good way to communicate.

1541
01:09:01.20 --> 01:09:08.64
Yeah, it's funny when you know that you kind of said that about the kiss ass guy. Because that

1542
01:09:08.64 --> 01:09:14.16
comes up a lot. I don't want to be kiss ass. And yeah, you don't. The kiss ass guy is the same thing

1543
01:09:14.16 --> 01:09:18.88
as being friend zone. You know what friends don't mean? Yeah, I do. It's the same thing. Yeah.

1544
01:09:18.88 --> 01:09:24.40
So like the girl, right, typically it's a guy who gets friend zone, right? Because he's like

1545
01:09:24.40 --> 01:09:30.16
too nice. He's too nice. He's too whatever. He's essentially a, and you're like a brother to

1546
01:09:30.16 --> 01:09:33.92
me intimate. Yes, man. That's what he is. So of course, the girl's going to keep them around for

1547
01:09:33.92 --> 01:09:40.56
all this like good feeling superficially. I mentioned lunch. All that stuff. All those superficial stuff.

1548
01:09:40.56 --> 01:09:46.08
He's not going to get anywhere of legitimacy with her. Actual decision making. If you translate

1549
01:09:46.08 --> 01:09:49.68
that into the, you know, working environment or whatever. Well, yeah, the boss, I mean, a certain

1550
01:09:49.68 --> 01:09:52.56
kind of boss, just like a certain girl's going to keep a guy around for that reason.

1551
01:09:53.20 --> 01:09:58.000
Certain boss is going to be like, yeah, I'll keep her around. I feel a little bit bad even firing

1552
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.92
the guy like that a little bit because he's just so nice to me and gives me all these compliments.

1553
01:10:01.92 --> 01:10:06.40
And even in a, you know, weird way, I think the kid's asked guy kind of knows that too. You know,

1554
01:10:06.40 --> 01:10:10.32
like, how why would he ever fire me even though he's not that good in the job or whatever, right?

1555
01:10:11.36 --> 01:10:15.52
Because, you know, he can't fire me. I'm just too nice to me. You know, there's that feeling is floating

1556
01:10:15.52 --> 01:10:20.40
around is what I'm saying. But it's the same deal, right? Like, it's too many compliments. Just too much of a

1557
01:10:20.40 --> 01:10:27.28
yes, man. I'll keep you around for very superficial reasons. But that's it, brother. You, you don't get past.

1558
01:10:27.92 --> 01:10:31.68
Yeah, that's, and that's not a good place to be in. No, it's not, sir.

1559
01:10:32.48 --> 01:10:37.68
That's why I'm not saying, kiss ass. And the way I just explained that of actually assuming that your

1560
01:10:37.68 --> 01:10:43.12
boss knows more than you is a good way to approach the situation. As opposed to approaching the

1561
01:10:43.12 --> 01:10:50.000
situation like you know more than your boss. Why act like that? The outcome isn't going to be inferior.

1562
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.28
The outcome is inferior. The outcome of acting like your boss or assuming that your boss knows

1563
01:10:55.28 --> 01:11:00.88
more than you. The outcome is you treat them with respect. Because the other way you could try and

1564
01:11:00.88 --> 01:11:05.60
treat them with respect, respect, but inadvertently you sound like, you know, some people, I just

1565
01:11:05.60 --> 01:11:14.40
we talk about normal face, right? Some people, they cannot even ask a question in a respectful way,

1566
01:11:14.40 --> 01:11:20.32
right? They can't even, what was I saying over here? They can't even say, you know, hey boss,

1567
01:11:20.32 --> 01:11:24.56
can you explain this to me? Because I really want to understand. They can't even say that, you know?

1568
01:11:24.56 --> 01:11:30.48
Hey boss, can you explain this to me? Because it doesn't make any sense. They can't even ask a

1569
01:11:30.48 --> 01:11:37.76
question in a respectful way. That's a skill you should master as a leader and as a follower,

1570
01:11:37.76 --> 01:11:43.12
as a leader and as a follower, how to ask questions in respectful way. Lave pointed this out.

1571
01:11:43.12 --> 01:11:50.08
Lave pointed out. We were talking about the fact of, I would say, with a story he's told a bunch

1572
01:11:50.08 --> 01:11:55.12
of times of going through the kill house and he's in the back of the train and you shouldn't

1573
01:11:55.12 --> 01:11:57.92
be in the back of the train. You should be somewhere where you can lead everyone because when

1574
01:11:57.92 --> 01:12:00.000
you're in the back of the train, you don't know what's happened in the front of the train.

1575
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.56
Of a soldier's a big group of people moving through a kill house. And I didn't, and he was, you know,

1576
01:12:04.56 --> 01:12:09.28
Jarko didn't say, hey, stop doing that and do it this other way. He's like, he asked me questions,

1577
01:12:09.28 --> 01:12:14.32
and he's like, they were real questions. I wasn't like, hey, they've wanted to hell or you're in the

1578
01:12:14.32 --> 01:12:18.64
back of the train. Is that a respectful question? No, it's not a respectful question. But it's like,

1579
01:12:18.64 --> 01:12:23.92
hey, Lave, what are you doing in the back of the train? This is a respectful question. I'm actually

1580
01:12:23.92 --> 01:12:28.40
assuming that maybe Lave who doesn't have the experience that I have, who's my subordinate,

1581
01:12:28.40 --> 01:12:33.04
as a platoon commander to me, that big task in the commander, my assumption is not that I know

1582
01:12:33.04 --> 01:12:36.64
more than him. My assumption is that he's got a reason for that. My assumption is that he knows

1583
01:12:36.64 --> 01:12:43.12
more than me. Which is one of the one of Jordan Peterson's 12 rules for life. It's like, uh, I think

1584
01:12:43.12 --> 01:12:47.52
it's assumed the person that you're talking to knows more than you. What I'm saying is the same thing.

1585
01:12:47.52 --> 01:12:53.68
Up and down the chain of command, you assume that your boss or your subordinate knows something

1586
01:12:53.68 --> 01:12:58.96
that you don't know. And if you can ask questions in that way, instead of asking questions,

1587
01:12:59.52 --> 01:13:04.40
boss, what are we doing this for? Or Lave, why are you doing that? Lave, why are you in the back of

1588
01:13:04.40 --> 01:13:09.04
the train? That's stupid. No. It's okay, Lave. Why are you in the back of the train? What is

1589
01:13:09.04 --> 01:13:14.88
your purpose of being back there? I genuinely genuinely want to know. And this isn't like,

1590
01:13:14.88 --> 01:13:19.44
I'm not even saying I'm acting like that. I truly genuinely want to know what the deal is.

1591
01:13:20.72 --> 01:13:27.36
So make the assumption up and down the chain of command that your boss, your subordinate,

1592
01:13:27.36 --> 01:13:34.40
knows more than you. And then ask good questions with true genuine curiosity that you want to

1593
01:13:34.40 --> 01:13:44.16
know the answers to. It's a good way to go about it. Like, okay. Next question. I'm a young

1594
01:13:44.16 --> 01:13:50.48
warehouse manager that takes ownership for anything and everything that goes wrong. This seems

1595
01:13:50.48 --> 01:14:00.56
to offend my coworkers. How can I fix it? Okay, classic dichotomy leadership question right there.

1596
01:14:01.60 --> 01:14:07.12
You've gone too far. That's what's happened. You've gone too far. So what you have to be,

1597
01:14:07.12 --> 01:14:13.92
do what you have to do is don't be offensive when you take ownership. When you take ownership,

1598
01:14:13.92 --> 01:14:22.80
some people get offended by that. So when you say, hey, you know what this is mine? I got this.

1599
01:14:23.44 --> 01:14:30.16
That bothers some people. When you say, you know what, this is my fault. I'm going to fix it.

1600
01:14:30.16 --> 01:14:36.40
That even that offend some people. What the tone? Just the tone. I'm like, no, this is my fault.

1601
01:14:36.40 --> 01:14:41.12
I got this. And you do that three times, four times, five times, and all of a sudden, because

1602
01:14:41.12 --> 01:14:45.44
of what everything's his fault. No, he's got to fix everything. They he doesn't think I can fix it.

1603
01:14:45.44 --> 01:14:52.16
Right. You can offend people with it with all kinds of stuff. You have to work very hard to offend people.

1604
01:14:52.72 --> 01:14:57.12
I mean, there's people get offended when you say something nice to them. You know what I mean?

1605
01:14:57.12 --> 01:15:06.16
Yes. You know what I mean? I was watching. I met the person that yoga dude that does like

1606
01:15:06.16 --> 01:15:13.52
yoga videos. He's got red hairs named spears. Yeah. I met him. He's randomly getting off a plane.

1607
01:15:14.24 --> 01:15:20.32
But he's he what I. Spears or seers. Seers. I think it's seers. Maybe what I say spears?

1608
01:15:20.32 --> 01:15:26.96
Yeah. I don't know. I know the guy though. Yeah. Yeah. He's a spiritual AF one. Yeah. Yeah. Very funny guy.

1609
01:15:26.96 --> 01:15:32.32
Very cool guy. And I was once I met him. I was a laugh and I was checking out a couple of videos,

1610
01:15:32.32 --> 01:15:38.40
but one of them was you know how to be offended at all things. And it's hilarious. Because

1611
01:15:39.12 --> 01:15:44.88
that's exactly what people, people with some people can get offended by anything. Yeah. So

1612
01:15:46.48 --> 01:15:49.76
that's what you got to watch out for. Even when you're taking ownership,

1613
01:15:50.40 --> 01:15:57.28
people can actually be offended by that if you go too far. So instead of overtly stepping up and taking

1614
01:15:57.28 --> 01:16:02.16
ownership in this particular case, then you can tell what what's going on here. My brother here,

1615
01:16:02.16 --> 01:16:07.76
young warehouse manager, he's fired up. He wants to make things happen. He wants to get after it.

1616
01:16:07.76 --> 01:16:11.76
And so what does he do? He's like, oh, I read extreme ownership. I'm going to take ownership of

1617
01:16:11.76 --> 01:16:16.08
everything. And that's a great attitude to have, except for you can offend people when you go too far.

1618
01:16:16.08 --> 01:16:19.52
Because you got to read the second book that I got to do in the kitchen so that you can

1619
01:16:19.52 --> 01:16:23.92
balance out out a little bit. So instead of saying like, hey, this is mine. I'm going to take

1620
01:16:23.92 --> 01:16:29.44
ownership of this and make it happen. Instead, you know, you look and say, hey, you know what,

1621
01:16:29.44 --> 01:16:34.08
do you want me to take care of this? Hey, you know what? That's probably in my department.

1622
01:16:34.08 --> 01:16:39.76
You want me to take care of that? So that way, it would or like, hey, it seems like this should be

1623
01:16:39.76 --> 01:16:45.52
something I should take care of. You want me to handle that. Instead of me, me, me, me. I got to

1624
01:16:45.52 --> 01:16:52.16
ask the question the other day at a Q&A. And the question started off with the person started the

1625
01:16:52.16 --> 01:16:58.16
question with, I've got the vote. I've got the question that everyone in here needs answered.

1626
01:16:59.20 --> 01:17:04.48
So so out of the gate, I was like, okay, so we have a situation here, right? Because that immediately

1627
01:17:04.48 --> 01:17:09.68
tells you that in that person's head, they've got they've got the question that everyone needs answered.

1628
01:17:10.56 --> 01:17:15.60
So there's already an ego scenario happening, like out of the gate. So

1629
01:17:17.28 --> 01:17:20.72
same thing here, you don't know if you're going to touch someone's egos, right? So when you say,

1630
01:17:20.72 --> 01:17:25.44
look, this is my deal. And I'm going to fix it. Like some people will take a fence that. So again,

1631
01:17:25.44 --> 01:17:31.52
you soften those a little bit, try and give credit up the chain of command, right? Try and give

1632
01:17:31.52 --> 01:17:36.32
credit down the chain of command. Instead of all take ownership of it, it's like, hey, we got what

1633
01:17:36.32 --> 01:17:42.48
if you say we, when when credit gets dulled out, get past that credit on, pass it to your peers,

1634
01:17:42.48 --> 01:17:49.20
pass it to your some more than it's past it to your boss. So that's it, take ownership,

1635
01:17:49.20 --> 01:17:53.76
what you need to do at this point, young man, is take ownership of being offensive.

1636
01:17:54.80 --> 01:17:59.44
And when you do that, you're going to be less offensive, you're going to be more covert.

1637
01:18:00.24 --> 01:18:04.08
Hey, guess what? Remember I said earlier, like, you don't get to pick the boss, you,

1638
01:18:05.20 --> 01:18:09.92
you don't get to pick your boss. You, but you get to pick the relationship you have. You don't get

1639
01:18:09.92 --> 01:18:13.20
to pick your, your peers. You don't get to pick your support as you get your team.

1640
01:18:13.20 --> 01:18:18.96
Hey, can you pick them? Yes, you can quit your job. Can you hire the right people? Yes,

1641
01:18:18.96 --> 01:18:24.16
you can. But look, what you got is what you got. You got to work with it. You do, everyone,

1642
01:18:24.16 --> 01:18:29.52
I wish everyone is more fired up like I am. But that's not going to go well. You know,

1643
01:18:29.52 --> 01:18:34.48
it's great that you wish that that's not going to go well. What you have to do is you got to,

1644
01:18:35.04 --> 01:18:40.56
you got to, you got to, here's another one, this is similar, right?

1645
01:18:40.56 --> 01:18:42.56
Millennials.

1646
01:18:45.28 --> 01:18:48.48
Well, hey, one of the things, what do they, this is a very simple, you know, I've, I've

1647
01:18:48.48 --> 01:18:52.88
done the Millennium Quest a thousand times. And, you know, the Vietnam veterans, the Vietnam

1648
01:18:52.88 --> 01:18:57.36
drafties compared to the, like, hey, we can talk about that again, we don't need to. But if you've

1649
01:18:57.36 --> 01:19:03.84
got to, if you're a charge of Millennials, and you think to yourself, Millennials, thinks

1650
01:19:03.84 --> 01:19:08.64
everything, they think everything centers around them. What do you do as a leader? You know,

1651
01:19:08.64 --> 01:19:12.16
what I do is a leader, I make everything center around them, and then they perform, and then they

1652
01:19:12.16 --> 01:19:16.08
get after it. And as they grow up, they learn that everything doesn't center around them. But I bring

1653
01:19:16.08 --> 01:19:20.80
them there. Why? Because I form a relationship. Why? Because I listen to them. Why? Because I understand them.

1654
01:19:23.20 --> 01:19:28.000
So you don't get the team that you want. You don't get the boss that you want. What you do is you play

1655
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.80
the game up and down the chain of command and form relationships up and down the chain of command.

1656
01:19:32.80 --> 01:19:37.92
That you want. What relationships do you want? From up the chain of command, you want them to

1657
01:19:37.92 --> 01:19:40.96
listen to you. You want them to give you what you need. You want them to get out of your way.

1658
01:19:41.76 --> 01:19:46.32
And let you do the mission. What about down the chain of command? You want them to support what's

1659
01:19:46.32 --> 01:19:51.12
happening. You want them to get after the job. You want them to step up and lead. That's what you want.

1660
01:19:52.96 --> 01:19:58.16
If you have an antagonistic relationship, because your Millennials think everything's about them,

1661
01:19:58.16 --> 01:20:01.76
well, then guess what? You're not going to be able to have any influence on them. Any real

1662
01:20:01.76 --> 01:20:10.40
influence. You can have the imposed will on them. But the imposed will is a paper tiger, right?

1663
01:20:10.40 --> 01:20:14.80
It's not real. It only lasts when you're there. And guess what they're doing? They're looking for

1664
01:20:14.80 --> 01:20:23.04
another job. So take ownership of being offensive and be less offensive and more covert. And

1665
01:20:23.04 --> 01:20:28.72
you know what? Bro, young warehouse manager, keep getting after it. And it will pay off. And the

1666
01:20:28.72 --> 01:20:34.16
fact that you're fired up and you're crushing it, crush it with a little bit more tact.

1667
01:20:34.16 --> 01:20:38.96
And you're going to one day you're going to be making it happen. Yeah. We'll get time for

1668
01:20:40.24 --> 01:20:46.000
one more question. Yeah. To add though a little tip, I think that I think you taught this to

1669
01:20:46.56 --> 01:20:52.16
actually I realized this when I embraced extreme ownership. You can't say, hey, I'm going to take

1670
01:20:52.16 --> 01:20:56.56
extreme ownership of this. Like it's one of those things. It's like just like taking the high ground,

1671
01:20:56.56 --> 01:21:01.36
right? You get in like a thing with somebody. Yeah. You can't say, I'm going to take the high ground.

1672
01:21:01.36 --> 01:21:05.44
And then it doesn't work like that. Like it, it just came up the high ground when you announced

1673
01:21:05.44 --> 01:21:08.80
that you were taking the high ground. Give it up. Exactly. Same thing with extreme ownership.

1674
01:21:08.80 --> 01:21:12.16
Like in this situation. So if you're a very good point at going to the top. And the thing is

1675
01:21:12.16 --> 01:21:16.16
I get it man. When you're like, you know, I'm taking it and he even said I take ownership of anything

1676
01:21:16.16 --> 01:21:20.88
and everything. That goes wrong. Anything like straight up because you're guy. Right. So it might

1677
01:21:20.88 --> 01:21:25.52
indicate, I'm not saying he's doing this, but he could be going, hey guys, no worries. I'm taking

1678
01:21:25.52 --> 01:21:29.28
extreme ownership of this situation. You know, like if you say that kind of stuff, yeah, I could see

1679
01:21:29.28 --> 01:21:34.96
that would rub somebody. What's odd? And this is a very good thing to understand about human nature.

1680
01:21:36.24 --> 01:21:41.12
Everyone's jealous of you. Everyone's jealous of each other. Everyone's jealous of everyone else.

1681
01:21:41.12 --> 01:21:49.12
No one wants you to win. Right. It's just like so when this guy is stepping up, the crowd starts to

1682
01:21:49.12 --> 01:21:52.56
pick at him. They start to pick at him and they want to pick him. They want to pull him apart.

1683
01:21:52.56 --> 01:21:58.48
That's generally what the crowd wants to do to you. When you step up, when you elevate yourself,

1684
01:21:58.48 --> 01:22:05.04
generally, the crowd wants to pick it to your pull you down. You think he exactly exactly. So if you're

1685
01:22:05.04 --> 01:22:12.40
aware of that, then you can combat it by when instead of elevating yourself in an overt manner,

1686
01:22:12.40 --> 01:22:16.96
wherever you can see you saying, I'm going to take ownership this right now and get it soft.

1687
01:22:16.96 --> 01:22:21.84
No. Usually if I can say, hey, you know what? This is probably my fault. Do you want me to

1688
01:22:21.84 --> 01:22:26.16
let me try and take some time and get it fixed? Everyone goes, they're actually kind of happy. They're like,

1689
01:22:26.16 --> 01:22:31.76
yeah, it was your fault. They kind of like, it's okay with them. Whereas opposed to,

1690
01:22:31.76 --> 01:22:35.92
I'm going to take ownership. This is dichotomy leadership. You're red, extreme ownership.

1691
01:22:35.92 --> 01:22:38.88
Awesome. You got to read dichotomy too.

1692
01:22:41.52 --> 01:22:46.32
That's shit. It's a question. When something goes wrong, I freeze up,

1693
01:22:46.32 --> 01:22:52.72
opposite of the, you know, I freeze up. I get stagnant. I don't want to move. I just ask myself,

1694
01:22:52.72 --> 01:22:59.84
why me? I've tried saying good, but it's not getting me moving forward in your advice.

1695
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:14.88
You ask yourself, why me? So, saying good, that should fix your attitude.

1696
01:23:14.88 --> 01:23:26.16
But that alone, that alone will not fix your problems. If you're having problems, sure,

1697
01:23:27.60 --> 01:23:34.88
say good, that's perfect. But then don't ask yourself, why me?

1698
01:23:37.44 --> 01:23:41.28
Instead, ask yourself, now what am I going to do about it?

1699
01:23:41.28 --> 01:23:45.92
What are you going to do about? Ask yourself that question.

1700
01:23:48.40 --> 01:23:55.28
And then figure it out. Figure out what you're going to do. Say to yourself,

1701
01:23:55.28 --> 01:24:02.40
I am going to detach. I am going to assess the situation. I am going to come up with a plan,

1702
01:24:02.40 --> 01:24:16.32
and I am going to execute. And then start moving. It's not going to be a perfect plan,

1703
01:24:16.32 --> 01:24:24.40
but take action, action that moves you in a positive direction. And if it ends up being the wrong

1704
01:24:24.40 --> 01:24:35.84
direction, that's fine. At least you've learned where not to go. Now, where this gets tough,

1705
01:24:37.44 --> 01:24:44.16
is if it is something that seems like it's completely out of your control.

1706
01:24:45.36 --> 01:24:50.32
And you know what, some things are completely out of your control, and that's fine.

1707
01:24:50.32 --> 01:24:58.32
And when that happens, you ask yourself, what can I control?

1708
01:25:00.64 --> 01:25:06.16
What can I control? That will make this situation a little bit better.

1709
01:25:06.16 --> 01:25:17.68
And then you go. Don't get crushed by things going wrong.

1710
01:25:20.32 --> 01:25:27.76
Ask yourself, what am I going to do and then go do it?

1711
01:25:27.76 --> 01:25:38.96
And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So echo Charles speaking of

1712
01:25:40.72 --> 01:25:47.12
moving in the right direction. I know you've got some things that can help us move in the right direction.

1713
01:25:47.12 --> 01:25:51.76
What do you got for us? Yeah. Okay. So, that's it. That's what I'm going to do. So,

1714
01:25:51.76 --> 01:25:58.40
so the path has what many directions, but it's all in the same general direction. It's improvement.

1715
01:25:59.68 --> 01:26:05.12
It's improvement. There's different roads on the path. Yes. Which is a really weird thing to say.

1716
01:26:05.12 --> 01:26:09.60
Yeah. It's more of a general thing. Anyway, but you just do the universal in my opinion. I'm assuming

1717
01:26:09.60 --> 01:26:14.16
in your opinion too. Where if you're not doing you just do more so than I would say,

1718
01:26:14.16 --> 01:26:21.60
like that's terrible. I'm not going to say that. But I'm saying if you go through life and not

1719
01:26:21.60 --> 01:26:28.56
do jujitsu and you're on the path, you might be left maybe missing out. You know what's really cool

1720
01:26:28.56 --> 01:26:34.40
about this podcast and about people listening this podcast and about people starting jujitsu.

1721
01:26:34.40 --> 01:26:39.68
This is the coolest thing. Two years ago, I would've been like, hey, you know, you should try

1722
01:26:39.68 --> 01:26:48.64
jujitsu. It's really good. But I couldn't like confirm how universal so many people, I just,

1723
01:26:48.64 --> 01:26:52.64
so many people have to take their first class or the first nine classes or the first three classes.

1724
01:26:52.64 --> 01:26:57.44
They're like, I'm addicted. Yeah. Why is that? Because there's something special about

1725
01:26:57.44 --> 01:27:02.64
jujitsu. So, you should train it. Yeah. Yeah. When you can draw them, the parallels, the meta.

1726
01:27:02.64 --> 01:27:06.48
It's the metaphor for like, the 18 list to tell me that early on actually.

1727
01:27:06.48 --> 01:27:11.76
You know, actually, the master philosopher. They did a class for and under govow. It'll

1728
01:27:11.76 --> 01:27:16.000
straight at some point. And a big one that under govow said that I will never forget. It's like,

1729
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.96
jujitsu is like, is life. So, consider jujitsu. Like, if you turn your back on your problems,

1730
01:27:20.96 --> 01:27:24.64
in jujitsu, they're going to get worse. And let's face it. That's in, especially early on. That's how

1731
01:27:24.64 --> 01:27:28.000
you get a guy to turn. That's how you get a choke. Right. When you're mounted on somebody,

1732
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.76
you slap him in the face. Why? And why? If you get slapped in the face, what do you want to do?

1733
01:27:31.76 --> 01:27:34.96
Turn your back. Right? They call it don't slap my face. That's how you get the choke.

1734
01:27:34.96 --> 01:27:40.48
So, under govow said, and jujitsu, you turn your back. And you give your back to your opponent.

1735
01:27:41.04 --> 01:27:45.44
That's the worst thing you can do. But it's hard to face them usually. You got to work, you know?

1736
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.44
Same thing in life, man. Turn your back on your problems. Those problems are going to get you.

1737
01:27:49.44 --> 01:27:54.24
Yeah. Then you've heard me say that at the master. You turn your back on your problems. They don't

1738
01:27:54.24 --> 01:27:58.08
go away. They actually get worse. And it's the same exact thing in jujitsu.

1739
01:27:58.08 --> 01:28:04.80
I'm not joking. Yes. Getting particularly angry. So it's cool now to get feedback from thousands of

1740
01:28:04.80 --> 01:28:12.56
people that have now gotten in the jujitsu game and the feedback, I've got probably, I think,

1741
01:28:12.56 --> 01:28:18.72
three people out of many, many. And this isn't one of yours where you say like a lot of people

1742
01:28:18.72 --> 01:28:24.72
and it's like four. I'm talking thousands of people. I've gotten three that don't like jujitsu.

1743
01:28:24.72 --> 01:28:29.68
That did, they just don't like it. And that's why I came up with the rule. Okay, if you don't like it,

1744
01:28:29.68 --> 01:28:34.24
that's fine. Train at least until you've submitted someone that's kind of equivalent.

1745
01:28:34.88 --> 01:28:39.52
And then you can stop. Yeah. And the reason I think, I think that's actually once you do that,

1746
01:28:39.52 --> 01:28:42.72
you'll you'll understand jujitsu because I'm going to just don't even understand it.

1747
01:28:42.72 --> 01:28:46.64
Sometimes people just can't comprehend it. They can't comprehend what's happening.

1748
01:28:46.64 --> 01:28:52.24
And it's just too much. Yeah. This is too much. Yeah. And so they don't want to do it.

1749
01:28:52.24 --> 01:28:57.52
Yeah. But if you do it long enough that you submit someone, then you get that little like,

1750
01:28:57.52 --> 01:29:03.76
wow, the fucker. It's incredible like at the master when you when you show the connection of

1751
01:29:03.76 --> 01:29:09.76
two moves. Yeah. This like, it's like amazing. Oh yeah. And then when you try and explain that every

1752
01:29:09.76 --> 01:29:17.28
move is connected that way. Because that's a big, so it's a big network. But but people don't

1753
01:29:17.28 --> 01:29:24.48
understand that jujitsu is not just moves. Yeah. That it's all this grouped thing together.

1754
01:29:24.48 --> 01:29:31.20
This symphony of movement. Leng which is good. Anyway, when you do it,

1755
01:29:31.20 --> 01:29:35.28
you're going to need a key because you're going to do key and no key. So key and rash card. That's

1756
01:29:35.28 --> 01:29:40.08
the uniform. Call it a uniform. Sure. So you go to origin because you're going to get an origin

1757
01:29:40.08 --> 01:29:47.04
key. It's the best one. Origin main dot com or it just means we forgive to say that. We're not good. I

1758
01:29:47.04 --> 01:29:54.08
feel like I forget to say that the name is origin. I say origin mean. Okay. So cool. But you'll,

1759
01:29:54.08 --> 01:29:59.44
yeah, you'll come to realize that it's very obvious that origin is the only kind of key that you'll

1760
01:29:59.44 --> 01:30:04.64
want slash need. I mean America, by the way, the threads are me. I like to throw that out there.

1761
01:30:04.64 --> 01:30:08.40
Just like, oh, by the way, like it's made America. No, it's not just something you throw out there.

1762
01:30:08.40 --> 01:30:17.68
It's a big deal. We're talking about a loom multiple times. I actually had this. So I was talking

1763
01:30:17.68 --> 01:30:22.40
to, is actually my literary agent. Sure. And I was like, well, you know, like, I said it turns out,

1764
01:30:23.68 --> 01:30:28.000
you know, they're not, they can't put out Mikey in the dragons before November. So I'm just going

1765
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.48
to, you know, make this book myself and starting a publishing company. And she's like, um,

1766
01:30:32.48 --> 01:30:38.40
well, you know, a lot of people try that. But you know, it's, there's a lot more to it. You know,

1767
01:30:38.40 --> 01:30:44.72
it's really hard. Yeah. And I was like, okay. Cool. Do you know what a loom is? I go, my friends

1768
01:30:44.72 --> 01:30:53.92
up and main brought a loom back from the grave and weave material from cotton and nylon to sew together.

1769
01:30:53.92 --> 01:30:59.84
The loom weighs 9,000 pounds. The loom weighs 9,000 pounds. There has 5 million threads in going into it.

1770
01:30:59.84 --> 01:31:05.28
It's got, it's got millions of parts inside of it. It was rusted. You're going to tell me we can't

1771
01:31:05.28 --> 01:31:11.12
get photocopy some stuff and put it out in the book. I got this. I got this. Don't, don't, don't,

1772
01:31:11.12 --> 01:31:16.80
and it's funny because I told that to Brian and Pete. I was laughing so hard because, because really,

1773
01:31:16.80 --> 01:31:21.92
what's what I, I don't even know if I could think of something harger. Then saying, oh, we're going

1774
01:31:21.92 --> 01:31:29.36
to drag a loom out of a dam, abandoned factory in Lewiston, Maine. Yeah. One loom left. The rest of

1775
01:31:29.36 --> 01:31:34.80
them have been sent overseas during the economic downturn. Oh, we'll just, we'll just, we'll just outsource.

1776
01:31:34.80 --> 01:31:39.68
Now I remind outsource, we're just going to send our bread and butter, our American hardware

1777
01:31:39.68 --> 01:31:45.60
overseas and let someone else make it. There was one loom left. And guess what? We got it.

1778
01:31:45.60 --> 01:31:52.32
Orgen. Yeah. So you're telling me that we can take this old loom that's 30 years old that

1779
01:31:52.32 --> 01:31:58.24
hasn't been run. That's rusted and dirty and abandoned and bring that thing back to life.

1780
01:31:58.24 --> 01:32:03.04
You're telling me we can't print some books and get him out to my people. You're wrong.

1781
01:32:03.04 --> 01:32:11.04
Watch me. Straight up wrong. Get some jockel publish. Yep. And that loom does not only make

1782
01:32:11.04 --> 01:32:15.92
geese in rashcards by the way. Multiple looms by the way. It wasn't just that one loom. No, it was

1783
01:32:15.92 --> 01:32:21.36
one loom. Oh, it turns in with yes. And now there's three looms. Rocking in roll. Yeah. Yeah. So,

1784
01:32:21.36 --> 01:32:29.84
yeah, you can get shirts and joggers and sweats. Sweats. Uh, uh, named. Named. I don't know about

1785
01:32:29.84 --> 01:32:34.48
name. We'll say named the most comfortable sweat and sweats in the world. Straight up. The joggers. I

1786
01:32:34.48 --> 01:32:40.16
proclaim straight up most comfortable pants in the world. Then the less. Find out for yourself.

1787
01:32:40.16 --> 01:32:45.44
Anyway, orgen made.com to make a lot of cool good stuff all made in America by the way. Yeah. And

1788
01:32:45.44 --> 01:32:50.56
that includes made in America supplements. Jockel, stop. Jockel, stop. Jockel, stop.

1789
01:32:50.56 --> 01:32:58.64
But, you know, the jocco thing is just to complete a lack of originality. That's what it is.

1790
01:32:58.64 --> 01:33:03.44
Get. Because when you think about it from a broader perspective and you know me well enough to be like,

1791
01:33:03.44 --> 01:33:10.08
the last thing I would do is like, oh, I'm just going to call everything jocco. It's like,

1792
01:33:10.08 --> 01:33:15.12
bizarre, although. Yeah. Well, and it started with a podcast. It started with jockel podcast. And

1793
01:33:15.12 --> 01:33:20.88
that after I've said this before, but I was on Tim Ferriss's podcast and he was, he said, like,

1794
01:33:20.88 --> 01:33:27.44
are you hungry? And I was like, jockel hungry. And for some reason that just made me jockel. And then

1795
01:33:27.44 --> 01:33:31.52
when we were naming this podcast, I was like, oh, you're like, what do you call him like,

1796
01:33:31.52 --> 01:33:37.12
jockel podcast? As if it's the same nanderfall thing. And so then then it was like, okay,

1797
01:33:37.12 --> 01:33:41.12
we're going to make tea. What do you call, Paul McGrann at white tea? What do we call it? Like,

1798
01:33:41.12 --> 01:33:45.20
the Vedic solution? I mean, what are you going to call it? Like, it's like, okay, well,

1799
01:33:45.20 --> 01:33:49.60
just it's going to be the tea that I drink. So it's called jocco white tea. Okay, cool. Well, then

1800
01:33:50.32 --> 01:33:56.72
hey, when I when I started saying, you know what, I need to make some good supplements,

1801
01:33:56.72 --> 01:34:02.24
Pete and Brian in the game. Like, I'm like, hey, go, and you make this. And they're like,

1802
01:34:02.24 --> 01:34:06.32
yeah, and I said, okay, well, then what are we going to call it? Well, just call it, you know,

1803
01:34:06.32 --> 01:34:14.08
jockel super cool. Then there you go. So that's how we end up with the least creative name of any

1804
01:34:14.08 --> 01:34:19.84
products they've existed. I apologize to everyone. Actually, it seemed like well early on anyway,

1805
01:34:19.84 --> 01:34:23.76
it seemed like it wasn't creative because you're like, hey, this create like, if I create this

1806
01:34:23.76 --> 01:34:30.32
super creative name, like, is that important? Really great. Now I'm too busy making it good. Well,

1807
01:34:30.32 --> 01:34:35.76
we talked about in the last podcast that sometimes I'm so in the functionality. Yeah, that's

1808
01:34:35.76 --> 01:34:42.56
it. That I'm not in in synchronicity with the rest of the world sometimes. For instance,

1809
01:34:42.56 --> 01:34:49.28
if you allowed me to design a house, no human being would live in the house except for me and like

1810
01:34:49.28 --> 01:34:53.12
three other seals that I know that would be like, oh, it's house is perfect. I've never

1811
01:34:53.12 --> 01:34:57.84
know to be like, bro, what is wrong with you? And so you, you know, you have to keep that.

1812
01:34:57.84 --> 01:35:01.84
Same with vehicles. Like, if I could design my own vehicle, no one would want to drive it, but me.

1813
01:35:01.84 --> 01:35:05.52
Maybe that's what I want to make. They look a little bit broader because you get people that'd be like,

1814
01:35:05.52 --> 01:35:14.000
yeah, oh, so I have to be careful because sometimes I'm just so into function that it just doesn't

1815
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.12
make sense to anyone else but me. Yeah, but it does have its value big time when it comes to

1816
01:35:19.12 --> 01:35:24.32
supplements because what joint warfare function. Try lose function or you're joint see what happens.

1817
01:35:24.32 --> 01:35:29.20
Same thing with cruel oils, same thing with discipline, brain function. And then of course,

1818
01:35:29.20 --> 01:35:35.52
that's muscle function muscle building function recovery. Yeah. It does look all of them together.

1819
01:35:35.52 --> 01:35:43.52
Brain function joint function muscle function. Boom, you're good to go. Yeah. Yeah. And speaking of

1820
01:35:43.52 --> 01:35:51.04
functionality and this is one of the things where you to kind of attack me. You attacked me because

1821
01:35:51.68 --> 01:35:57.20
for you in, see, this is this is a perfect example. In your mind, I'm all about function, right?

1822
01:35:57.20 --> 01:36:03.28
Yes. Then when I started making supplements, I wanted them to taste good. Yes. And that was actually,

1823
01:36:04.40 --> 01:36:09.84
it was actually side by side with functionality. His taste. Why is that? Because if you

1824
01:36:09.84 --> 01:36:13.12
don't, if it doesn't taste good, then it's not going to function because you're not going to use it.

1825
01:36:14.32 --> 01:36:21.60
So these taste delish, especially, more, let's face the facts. There's this, it's this whole new thing.

1826
01:36:21.60 --> 01:36:26.72
Yeah. It's a, it's literally a new thing in the world. We had to create, I created a name for it.

1827
01:36:27.60 --> 01:36:31.92
Mulk, why did I create that name? What else you're going to call it? It doesn't make sense to call it anything else.

1828
01:36:31.92 --> 01:36:35.12
Because it's not anything else. It just is mulk. That's what it is.

1829
01:36:36.56 --> 01:36:43.76
Now, okay. I got four kids. We know I have four kids. I spend time with kids. I see kids all the time.

1830
01:36:43.76 --> 01:36:48.56
We got kids to just programs at my gym. What do kids need kids need fuel? What do kids get fed?

1831
01:36:48.56 --> 01:36:54.16
They get fed crap. Why? Because there's, there's sugar in everything. There's high-fruits,

1832
01:36:54.16 --> 01:36:58.40
those currents were, corn syrup and everything. There's, it's just garbage.

1833
01:36:59.60 --> 01:37:04.64
So, with my own kids, what do I want to feed them? I want to feed them something that's good.

1834
01:37:04.64 --> 01:37:11.76
We made warrior kid mulk. Why? Because kids need good foodie. We're putting kids on the warrior path.

1835
01:37:11.76 --> 01:37:18.16
I get letters every single day from kids all over the world, New Zealand, Australia.

1836
01:37:18.16 --> 01:37:23.76
Europe, America, for sure. Kids that are seven years old, that are nine years old, that are 11

1837
01:37:23.76 --> 01:37:28.40
years old, that are 14 years old, and they're on the path. They're doing pull-ups. They're doing

1838
01:37:28.40 --> 01:37:32.16
jujitsu. They're sending pictures of their jujitsu tournament. They're drawing pictures of

1839
01:37:32.16 --> 01:37:37.76
their metal that they got for jujitsu. There's kids that are on the warrior kid path. What are they eating?

1840
01:37:38.96 --> 01:37:42.56
Are they eating junk? Sometimes they're eating junk, not because they want to, but that's because

1841
01:37:42.56 --> 01:37:50.72
that's what's in their fridge. So, had to solve that problem. So, we made warrior kid mulk. Again,

1842
01:37:50.72 --> 01:37:56.08
what was equivalent to functionality? The function was they need protein, they need vitamins,

1843
01:37:56.08 --> 01:38:03.76
they need probiotics. Functional. Part side-by-side with that had to taste good. Had to taste good.

1844
01:38:04.56 --> 01:38:07.92
And what do we end up with? Warrior kid mulk, chocolate and strawberry.

1845
01:38:07.92 --> 01:38:18.96
It's freaking delicious. Both of them. They're so good. They're so tasty. It's ridiculous.

1846
01:38:18.96 --> 01:38:27.92
So, that's warrior kid mulk. That's available from originmain.com. We're going to try and get

1847
01:38:27.92 --> 01:38:34.08
that one out to the masses. Every kid needs warrior kid mulk. Instead of drinking some sugarful

1848
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:40.08
crap of fillers. We're going to give you real food. Gonna make you stronger. We're so good.

1849
01:38:40.08 --> 01:38:44.96
Yeah man. We can't have had soda growing up in my house, but I used to go to my friend's house

1850
01:38:44.96 --> 01:38:50.88
and he was Eric Masters. He's a pilot from the first by the way. So, I'd go to his house and

1851
01:38:50.88 --> 01:38:54.24
they'd have, so he didn't. He wasn't pounding. So, what other time is it superior athlete? Oh,

1852
01:38:54.24 --> 01:38:58.16
this is the sky. But they had soda kind of above the thing. Wait, so when I was a kid,

1853
01:38:58.16 --> 01:39:02.16
we didn't even relate. Like, soda wasn't bad for you. We just were like, oh, this is just,

1854
01:39:02.16 --> 01:39:05.52
this is just how? Like, oh, we just directly, I'm thirsty. I'm going to drink a coke.

1855
01:39:05.52 --> 01:39:10.08
Yeah. And the answer to your phrase, but that like when you're a kid, like, oh, I haven't

1856
01:39:10.08 --> 01:39:14.64
drinking anything all day. I'm really thirsty. Give me a coke. Yeah. You just drink it. Exactly.

1857
01:39:14.64 --> 01:39:18.64
Right. And that's the point. You don't know that there was 36 grams of corn syrup in there.

1858
01:39:18.64 --> 01:39:23.92
Yeah. It's a, yeah. Good job. Thinking back, I'm like, dang, that is a crazy violation.

1859
01:39:23.92 --> 01:39:28.64
Crazy. Well, could you imagine, like, an only weighed 48 pounds? Yeah.

1860
01:39:28.64 --> 01:39:33.36
It wasn't like it wasn't like you're a 225 pound grown man. Like I am right now.

1861
01:39:33.36 --> 01:39:38.32
I can probably put down a coke in a wooden, but you're, you're nine years old.

1862
01:39:38.32 --> 01:39:44.64
Look, here it. Get some of that wrong. Some grape crush. Yeah. Pineapple. So,

1863
01:39:44.64 --> 01:39:48.64
anywhere's a cut you know, in a, in a, in a, in a, a master's. No. Yeah. But no, that was, that,

1864
01:39:48.64 --> 01:39:52.64
that's the point where you go in. It's just, so that's just how, oh, yeah, grab a soda after

1865
01:39:52.64 --> 01:39:57.12
school, whatever. They'd sell soda for 50 cents after our school. You go in the thing, you buy the soda,

1866
01:39:57.12 --> 01:40:02.32
whatever, soda machine, whatever. What if he was milked, though? Oh, way better. Way better.

1867
01:40:02.32 --> 01:40:05.12
Because it tastes just as good. If it actually tastes better, then it's so tough.

1868
01:40:05.12 --> 01:40:09.84
It's like that's all for sure. Yeah. Oh, the naïvil. Yeah. And you're, yeah, that'd be just

1869
01:40:09.84 --> 01:40:16.40
be way better. So, there you go. Warrior kid milk, but milk for the adults. And then the other

1870
01:40:16.40 --> 01:40:20.40
funny thing was I had all the people send in pictures of their kids drinking. Before we had Warrior

1871
01:40:20.40 --> 01:40:23.60
Kid Mokers, the kids were just straight up going down the Mokers, trained themselves.

1872
01:40:23.60 --> 01:40:28.88
Little kids, two years old, three years old, four years old, little kids drinking Mok.

1873
01:40:28.88 --> 01:40:37.28
Oh, I got the Warrior Kid Mok. Little less protein. Tasty as can be vitamins, probiotics,

1874
01:40:38.32 --> 01:40:43.44
just good to go. Go away to go. 100%. Yeah, totally good to go. You're going to change the world

1875
01:40:43.44 --> 01:40:47.68
with that one. You're going to make it strong again. Also, if you want to represent,

1881
01:41:14.40 --> 01:41:22.40
We're like, oh, I got fans. No, it was. Of course, well, there's that. But in this way, for someone

1891
01:42:12.80 --> 01:42:18.40
kid podcast on repeat for his kids. I talked to so many people when we got roll call,

1892
01:42:18.40 --> 01:42:24.24
mustard. They're like, yeah, we're going. We just got it 24, 7 kids in the car. We're listening to

1893
01:42:24.24 --> 01:42:29.52
warrior kid podcast. The lessons that you want to teach your kid that your kid doesn't really want

1894
01:42:29.52 --> 01:42:33.76
to hear from you because you're their mom. You're their dad. They don't want to hear it from you.

1895
01:42:33.76 --> 01:42:38.64
They want to hear it from Uncle Jake. They want to hear it from Uncle Jake. And I'd go so far as to say,

1896
01:42:40.16 --> 01:42:45.44
don't even, you know, you said you can't just say, I'm going to take extreme ownership of that. What

1897
01:42:45.44 --> 01:42:49.20
you can't do with your kids is turn around when you're in the car and say, you see Uncle Jake

1898
01:42:49.20 --> 01:42:54.40
seeing the same thing I told you. Yeah, don't do that. Don't don't don't discredit Uncle Jake.

1899
01:42:55.76 --> 01:42:58.48
And you're not really discrediting him. But what you're doing is

1900
01:42:58.48 --> 01:43:05.60
you're bringing your, you're forming a team, right? You're forming a team. It's us against you.

1901
01:43:05.60 --> 01:43:10.80
And when Uncle Jake's talking to kid down the same team, yeah, Uncle Jake is in the game with the

1902
01:43:10.80 --> 01:43:18.72
kids, the kids, you have a natural friction with your parents. If you take Uncle Jake's side

1903
01:43:18.72 --> 01:43:23.04
strongly, now you're on Uncle Jowt, you against your kids against you. You don't want that.

1904
01:43:23.04 --> 01:43:27.12
You should almost play reverse psychology. Yeah. And be like, well, you know, it's a little

1905
01:43:27.12 --> 01:43:31.36
extreme for Uncle Jake to want to work out that much. And your kid be like, well,

1906
01:43:32.16 --> 01:43:37.84
I think we should probably let's know Uncle Jake. Dad. Maybe maybe we should get a pull up bar.

1907
01:43:38.40 --> 01:43:42.48
By the way, get a pull up bar for your kids. Just get a pull up bar form. You

1908
01:43:42.48 --> 01:43:48.64
doesn't cost much cost 12 bucks. You just need to piece a pipe. And you just, you just put it

1909
01:43:48.64 --> 01:43:53.52
hang it somewhere for your kids. They can do pull ups. Pull ups are important for children. Straight

1910
01:43:53.52 --> 01:43:59.92
up. There's some fact about no kid that can do a pull up is obese in the whole world. You can't

1911
01:43:59.92 --> 01:44:07.12
be obese and do a pull up as a kid. So let's do some pull ups. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like a good way too

1912
01:44:07.12 --> 01:44:11.44
for the don't don't be like, I'm going to put this on and you're going to listen. Oh yeah,

1913
01:44:11.44 --> 01:44:18.56
don't do that. Like it. Yeah. You want the kids you want. It's like when you go through military boot camp,

1914
01:44:18.56 --> 01:44:25.12
the drill instructors are real mean because they want you to form a gang against them. That's

1915
01:44:25.12 --> 01:44:30.64
part of the psychologists. They want it to be us against them. So we form up into a pull tune and

1916
01:44:30.64 --> 01:44:35.60
we're against this guy and then the end all comes together. Same thing we're going here. We,

1917
01:44:35.60 --> 01:44:43.04
you don't you want to let Uncle Jake be part of their team. And you just, oh man, well,

1918
01:44:43.04 --> 01:44:48.72
this stuff Uncle Jake says man, he seems like a pretty intense guy. And actually Uncle

1919
01:44:48.72 --> 01:44:52.96
Jake isn't that intense on the warrior kid podcast. No. He's telling stories about being a kid.

1920
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.60
He's answering questions about being a kid. Yeah. podcast is soft. I mean not softer, but like

1921
01:44:59.60 --> 01:45:03.20
he's not is he's more intense in the book. For sure. He's more intense in the book. Yeah.

1922
01:45:03.20 --> 01:45:09.76
Yeah. We can up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. There you go. Also,

This is a known fact. Psychological warfare, little album with tracks to help you get through

1929
01:45:50.08 --> 01:45:53.84
those moments of weakness. There's a new one being made. We're working on it. If you got any

1930
01:45:53.84 --> 01:45:57.12
recommendations or any suggestions or anything you need from psychological warfare,

1931
01:45:57.84 --> 01:46:02.80
some moment of weakness that you have, we got a request for shopping an impulsive shopper.

1932
01:46:02.80 --> 01:46:08.72
We're going to put a damper on that, straight up, shut that down. Other things, smoking,

1933
01:46:09.76 --> 01:46:14.40
we're going to shut that down. Yeah. So if you got any suggestions for that, then you can make

1934
01:46:14.40 --> 01:46:21.12
that happen. That's available anywhere you can buy MP3s. Yeah. Very, 100% success rate. Also,

1935
01:46:21.12 --> 01:46:27.36
speaking of moments of weakness like if you don't want to go to the gym, get stuff,

1936
01:46:27.36 --> 01:46:32.08
gym stuff, work out equipment for your house. This is where you get them on it.com. Get

1937
01:46:32.08 --> 01:46:37.60
all the kettlebells, rings, battle ropes. You can get a mason of club. Do that.

1938
01:46:38.24 --> 01:46:41.60
But you're going to good work out. Anyway, makes it way easier to stay on the path.

1939
01:46:41.60 --> 01:46:45.76
Why it goes with face at driving to the gym is not that cool. And if you're feeling lazy

1940
01:46:45.76 --> 01:46:50.64
or your time is pressuring like time constraints, but I just stay home. Get a workout hard one

1941
01:46:50.64 --> 01:46:56.000
too. That's where I get my hands from. You know, yeah, on it.com slash jockel. That's a spot to go

1942
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:04.40
100%. Also, jockel white tea. That's it. I'm like almost like it was going to have some music.

1943
01:47:05.76 --> 01:47:12.72
Jockel white tea. Well, and there's a day caught in me in that too. Sure. It tastes good. We

1944
01:47:12.72 --> 01:47:18.88
know that. It's tasting good as part of the functionality I get. But like white tea kind of sounds

1945
01:47:18.88 --> 01:47:26.88
kind of light and like, Dane. Oh, I see something. It's like a black coffee. You know, and you

1946
01:47:26.88 --> 01:47:32.24
could not have known that coffee. Get some power. I was telling life. I've never had a sip of coffee

1947
01:47:32.24 --> 01:47:36.80
in my whole life. I thought you said you didn't like the taste. Okay. Well, I should have clarified

1948
01:47:36.80 --> 01:47:43.28
that. You don't like the smell. So I didn't put it to my lips. No, really. All right, hey man, fair enough.

1949
01:47:43.28 --> 01:47:51.60
I dig it. Jockel white tea. My wife's mom, a Brit. Sure. Like my wife's a Brit. My wife's mom is

1950
01:47:51.60 --> 01:47:56.64
even more brainstrike because this is old. Oh, yeah. She guess what she drinks because you know,

1951
01:47:56.64 --> 01:48:00.56
you know, British people, they don't even play around with tea. They don't even play around with

1952
01:48:00.56 --> 01:48:07.04
tea. That's part of the deal part of the life. Guess what kind of tea she drinks? Jockel white. Yeah.

1953
01:48:07.04 --> 01:48:13.20
So I was she did that. We're sending shipments of Jockel white tea to England. So she

1954
01:48:13.20 --> 01:48:19.84
believed the the the the the damn world global home of tea. Yeah. They're the we're having to

1955
01:48:19.84 --> 01:48:25.28
ship it because you but your thing was always the cold the iced tea. No, I have the one tea. So you

1956
01:48:25.28 --> 01:48:30.96
I mean, as far as like before you made Jockel white tea, you I'd always see drinking the cold one.

1957
01:48:30.96 --> 01:48:36.72
Most most the time I prefer cold because most of the time I'm in a situation where I am

1958
01:48:36.72 --> 01:48:42.24
hot and I need to cool down. Sometimes I'm in a situation where I'm cool and I need to warm up.

1959
01:48:42.24 --> 01:48:46.56
When I want to sell them. Yeah, when you're cold, you want to be cozy. No, you're so good.

1960
01:48:46.56 --> 01:48:53.60
Better back off. But I'm saying Brits, they don't dig the cold iced tea. That's why.

1961
01:48:53.60 --> 01:48:57.60
Well, you know what's nice is like before you have to talk a lot. Sure. You can drink some

1962
01:48:57.60 --> 01:49:03.68
white tea for the throat. Just like relax the throat and yet at the same time you're getting a little

1963
01:49:03.68 --> 01:49:12.56
caffeine hitter. Give a little caffeine hitter with some antioxidants and not to mention if there's any vehicles

1964
01:49:12.56 --> 01:49:17.76
you need to pick up. You got an 8,000 pound deadlift to be good to go guarantee. Whatever you need.

1965
01:49:17.76 --> 01:49:22.64
Yeah, it's good. I saw the Yovon the other day and he was he posted something on Instagram. He had a

1966
01:49:22.64 --> 01:49:30.40
chick filet hitter. So those of you that are wondering about my hitter reference. Yes,

1967
01:49:30.40 --> 01:49:35.20
Theo Vaughn thank you. You have brought that word into my vocabulary and I had a little

1968
01:49:35.20 --> 01:49:41.52
jocquite hitter. I also have been using the term to describe one scoop of milk.

1969
01:49:42.48 --> 01:49:48.40
It was just that's just a one is a one scoop hitter. Good. Because because two scoops legitimately

1970
01:49:48.40 --> 01:49:52.72
fills you up, you don't want to eat a meal. Yeah. No, you don't want to. Or you you hate like a

1971
01:49:52.72 --> 01:49:57.52
little decent meal, but you still want something a dessert. Two two scoops. And you're just

1972
01:49:57.52 --> 01:50:04.000
that's too much. Too much. You have a little one scoop hitter. Easy one. And you're good to go. Good to go.

1973
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.44
And if you try the strawberry kids. Strawberry kids more because ridiculously tasty.

1976
01:50:20.24 --> 01:50:24.32

1977
01:50:24.32 --> 01:50:31.20
impolips studying memorizing, getting smarter, getting better. This is not,

1978
01:50:31.84 --> 01:50:38.32
