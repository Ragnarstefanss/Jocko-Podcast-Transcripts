[00:00:00] This is Jocopotcast number 163.
[00:00:02] The Coacherals and me, Jocco Whilling.
[00:00:05] Bitty-ding-accom.
[00:00:06] Good evening.
[00:00:07] I am bleeding out.
[00:00:13] I can feel my life,
[00:00:16] and being away as blood seeps from my body into the Iraqi soil.
[00:00:21] A few brown weeds splashed crimson now,
[00:00:26] or crushed around me as I lay sprawled on my back in the middle of this ambush.
[00:00:33] The weeds offer no concealment.
[00:00:36] I'm in the open, alone, and wounded.
[00:00:41] Sizzles of pain hit me in waves like pulses of electricity.
[00:00:47] A bullet has torn off my left arm.
[00:00:51] After I get hit, I reach over to grab my left hand.
[00:00:57] It isn't there.
[00:01:00] I hunt around feeling only the gear on the far left side of my body.
[00:01:04] No arm.
[00:01:07] I try to move the fingers on my left hand,
[00:01:09] but my mind sends signals to a station that doesn't exist.
[00:01:14] Now I can't feel anything, but pain.
[00:01:19] The bullets kick dirt in my face.
[00:01:22] Through my night vision goggles, I see green blooms of light strobing the darkness.
[00:01:28] Muscle flashes from automatic weapons.
[00:01:32] Ten meters away, and enemy machine gun opens fire again.
[00:01:37] It is a belt-fed Russian-made crew-served weapon, probably a PKM.
[00:01:43] They sound like giant zippers tearing open when the gunners go cyclic.
[00:01:48] Right now, the air around me erupts with sharp cracks.
[00:01:53] The miniature sonic booms of 7.62 millimeter bullet speeding past me at 2,500 feet per second.
[00:02:02] The terrorist gunner lowers his aim.
[00:02:06] A spurred of dust blows across my face again.
[00:02:09] Several bullets pass so close to my head that I feel shock waves as they go by.
[00:02:16] Through the left and AK-47 a sole rifle opens up, then another.
[00:02:20] I'm pinned in a crossfire without cover or concealment.
[00:02:23] A crippled sitting duck in a kill zone at least 100 meters long and 75 deep.
[00:02:32] With my right hand, I key the radio hands that I have mounted on my chest.
[00:02:36] Troops and contact, troops and contact, I call to my command.
[00:02:39] We have three severely wounded, including me.
[00:02:44] I'm a static, greets my words.
[00:02:50] I can't duck.
[00:02:52] I can't crawl away.
[00:02:54] There's no place to hide.
[00:02:55] All I can do is ignore the incoming fire and stay focused.
[00:03:01] The PKM gunner, PKM gunner finds the range.
[00:03:05] Bullets crack around me.
[00:03:09] Dirt flies.
[00:03:12] The terrorist eases up on the trigger, but only for a second.
[00:03:17] I hear him unleash another burst.
[00:03:22] Then I hear nothing at all.
[00:03:32] Those right there are some excerpts from the opening chapter of a book called The Trident,
[00:03:42] which is written by a retired seal officer by the name of Jason J. Redman.
[00:03:52] This book does an incredible job, not only of bringing the reader to the front lines
[00:04:00] in some pretty chaotic combat situations, but equally important, it brings the reader into
[00:04:08] the challenges of leadership and the challenges of life, especially the challenges of facing
[00:04:15] significant adversity.
[00:04:19] And J's book humbly displays those challenges wide open for all to see.
[00:04:31] And that humility from J is what makes this book so beneficial.
[00:04:40] He tells us plainly and bluntly of his personal triumphs and tragedies, his victories
[00:04:51] and his defeats and how he eventually found success and overcame by traveling.
[00:05:00] And the path of humility.
[00:05:05] And since I have the honor of actually knowing J, he has been kind enough to come by this
[00:05:13] evening and talk about his experiences with us.
[00:05:20] So with that, Mr. J Redman.
[00:05:23] Thanks for stopping by, brother.
[00:05:25] Jaco, brother, echo.
[00:05:26] Thank you.
[00:05:27] Thank you both.
[00:05:28] Have me on.
[00:05:29] Awesome to have you sitting here, man.
[00:05:31] Hey, man, honor to still be here.
[00:05:34] Bless.
[00:05:35] That's for sure.
[00:05:36] I tell so many people, I'm living on a second chance.
[00:05:39] You and I got too many brothers who are not, I don't know why the big man decided to give
[00:05:44] me a chance, but I'm making the most of it outstanding.
[00:05:48] So I want to try and start a little bit at the beginning, because people get a little bit
[00:05:54] familiar with where you are, everyone always wants to know where people are.
[00:05:58] People came from how they grew up.
[00:05:59] I'm going to the book right here.
[00:06:01] I came from a family with a rich tradition of service.
[00:06:03] So in retrospect, this made sense.
[00:06:05] My dad was a US Army airborne rigour at Fort Campbell during the Vietnam War.
[00:06:10] My paternal grandfather earned a distinguished fine cross while piloting a B-24 liberator
[00:06:16] bomber over the flat filled skies of Hitler's Europe.
[00:06:19] I also had a great uncle who flew fighter aircraft in the southwest Pacific during World
[00:06:23] War II.
[00:06:24] He made the ultimate sacrifice in battle against the Japanese.
[00:06:30] I dreamed of adding to that legacy, a life of combat, medals, and service.
[00:06:36] I was young and naive and had a long road to travel before I could truly understand what
[00:06:41] my grandfather and great uncle gave for the country.
[00:06:46] But that idealism became a very big part of me.
[00:06:50] I wanted to carry a rifle for a living.
[00:06:53] My dad watched this desire grow in me and decided to focus it.
[00:06:57] My freshman year in high school, he sat me down in our tiny living room and said, you
[00:07:01] know Jay, we had these guys come through airborne school.
[00:07:05] They were US Navy called Seals.
[00:07:09] They jumped out of airplanes, swam.
[00:07:11] They blew stuff up, given how you love the water.
[00:07:15] Maybe you ought to look into them.
[00:07:19] So your dad planted the seed, huh?
[00:07:21] It did.
[00:07:23] Young age.
[00:07:25] This was 90, probably 89, 88, 89.
[00:07:34] Back then, you really couldn't find hardly anything about the Seal teams.
[00:07:41] This was at a point in time where GI Joe was big.
[00:07:46] And I'm a 12, 13 year old kid into that.
[00:07:50] I was probably about 14 when my dad told me about the Seal teams.
[00:07:55] And started researching it, found almost nothing.
[00:07:59] By sheer happenstance, one of the guys in our church was a huge special operations buff.
[00:08:06] He was a guy that was unable to go on the military.
[00:08:08] He had had polio actually when he was a kid.
[00:08:12] He was just in batch-awaited by it and he had done tons of research.
[00:08:16] And he actually had collected some things about the Seal teams.
[00:08:19] He had an old soldier of fortune magazine.
[00:08:23] And you have those awesome.
[00:08:26] It's so different nowadays.
[00:08:27] No nowadays, you just Google it.
[00:08:29] Exactly.
[00:08:30] Back in the day, you had to be lucky enough to know some dude in church who happened to have
[00:08:33] a copy of the issue of soldier of fortune magazine.
[00:08:36] Is that still a thing?
[00:08:37] Is that what your fortune is still out there?
[00:08:38] Dude, it actually is.
[00:08:40] As a matter of fact, somehow in some weird twist of fate, I ended up being on the cover
[00:08:45] of soldier of fortune.
[00:08:46] I have to look, came out.
[00:08:48] And it was the most bizarre thing.
[00:08:49] Because now you're in the military and you look at this thing.
[00:08:52] You kind of laugh at soldier of fortune.
[00:08:53] It's a little bit of, you know, really focuses on probably the gung-ho aspect of soft
[00:09:00] as opposed to you came full circle.
[00:09:02] Yeah, full circle.
[00:09:03] That's what you're filled.
[00:09:04] Yeah.
[00:09:05] The soldier of fortune.
[00:09:06] It was pretty funny.
[00:09:07] But that magazine and that journey of coming to understand who these guys were that you
[00:09:14] really couldn't find much about them.
[00:09:16] It just drew me in even more.
[00:09:19] And the only thing, the core thread that I found over and over again was toughest training
[00:09:24] in the military.
[00:09:26] And you know, I was a young kid.
[00:09:27] I was a small kid and I just had this inner fire that if you told me I couldn't do
[00:09:33] something, it just drove me even more to want to do it.
[00:09:37] And everyone, you know, at that point in my life, I was probably four, four, eleven and about
[00:09:42] ninety five pounds.
[00:09:44] So when I told people I was going to become a seal.
[00:09:47] They laughed me out of the room.
[00:09:49] And that just fueled me even harder.
[00:09:51] And I set my sights on that dream.
[00:09:54] And that's where I was going.
[00:09:56] And you, some of the things you did, you started playing football.
[00:09:59] You started getting involved in sports to make sure you were physically fit and all that.
[00:10:02] So that was part of the driving factor and a good way to sort of prepare at least in a
[00:10:08] minimum way for buds.
[00:10:10] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:12] I mean, I wanted to build a mindset.
[00:10:14] I knew that fitness.
[00:10:15] I knew that being part of a team.
[00:10:17] I knew that pushing myself in different areas.
[00:10:19] So I started wrestling and I started playing football.
[00:10:21] And I was a small-ass guy on our team.
[00:10:23] But man, I just, I love football.
[00:10:25] I've always loved football.
[00:10:26] My dad had always told me, now you're too small.
[00:10:29] You're too small.
[00:10:30] You're going to get hurt.
[00:10:31] And so probably my 10th grade year, I said, I don't care what you're telling me.
[00:10:36] I'm going out for the team.
[00:10:38] And thankfully, we lived in a really small town.
[00:10:42] And I think they would take anyone and they looked at me and they said, well, we can
[00:10:45] at least use you as a tackling, don't we?
[00:10:48] And I said, Roger that, I'll do it, man.
[00:10:50] So, I will, you know, I'll hit somebody as hard as my 95 pounds camp.
[00:10:56] And got out there and just I loved the sport.
[00:10:58] And I know I was, you know, not a starter in any way, but I was out there every day.
[00:11:02] Just grinding and I'd trying to lay the hardest hits I could on people.
[00:11:06] And I played receiver and corner back.
[00:11:08] Nice.
[00:11:09] Now, I was also a little bit as I read through the book and it was kind of piecing
[00:11:14] together what you were like when you were a kid.
[00:11:16] I got to this point here.
[00:11:17] And she's kind of a little bit of a different direction going back to the book.
[00:11:21] At the same time, I fell in with the wrong crowd.
[00:11:24] I got a job my junior year and my work friends were drinkers.
[00:11:28] I started sneaking out of the house by sliding down the antenna pole outside my window.
[00:11:32] I'd meet with friends.
[00:11:33] We'd go drink at stagger home, drunk at odd hours the night scaling the side of the house
[00:11:38] with the help of that pole.
[00:11:39] My family tried to nudge me into course correction.
[00:11:43] But I had a chip on my shoulder and refused to listen, especially to my dad.
[00:11:46] Things got worse.
[00:11:47] My relationship with my father and step mom spiraled out of control into the ground.
[00:11:53] And instead of this war us all down as that slide continued.
[00:11:59] That happens.
[00:12:00] I mean, that straight up happens to kids, especially boys.
[00:12:05] And I think it has to do with I'm going to prove myself.
[00:12:07] I guess what I think.
[00:12:08] Hey, I'm going to prove myself.
[00:12:10] And one of the ways that you prove yourself is by proving that you're willing to sacrifice
[00:12:16] in a way and what better way when you're 16 years old to prove is like, oh, watch what
[00:12:22] I'll do.
[00:12:23] I'll drink all drink this whole bottle.
[00:12:26] And I think that leads to young males doing a lot of dumb stuff.
[00:12:29] And it sounds like you're right on board.
[00:12:32] Absolutely.
[00:12:33] You know, the thing that saved me though, this is where I got really lucky is I was smart
[00:12:38] enough and disciplined enough to understand that if I got myself in any kind of major trouble,
[00:12:47] I wouldn't be able to go on this yield to you.
[00:12:49] So like I said, we lived in a real small town in rural North Carolina and drugs were prevalent.
[00:12:57] And a lot of my friends were starting to get into that.
[00:13:00] And I just said, man, if I get, you know, that'll stop me from going in the Navy.
[00:13:03] So at least there was kind of a line I wasn't willing to cross.
[00:13:07] And I'm unfortunate.
[00:13:08] There were a couple of times we got ourselves in trouble where, you know, we were right
[00:13:12] on the edge of the law being involved.
[00:13:14] And, you know, we managed to dodge that bullet.
[00:13:18] But yeah, I wanted to get out there.
[00:13:20] I wanted to fit in.
[00:13:21] So I think it's a combination of both peer pressure as a young man, you know, I want
[00:13:24] to finish with this group.
[00:13:26] But I have my hopes and dreams so this direction I'm going.
[00:13:29] And I think that's where a lot of young men get off track.
[00:13:32] They want to fit in so much that they give up on their hopes and dreams and they get sucked
[00:13:36] down this path.
[00:13:38] For me, I had such a little laser focus on what I wanted to do that at least kept me in
[00:13:44] check.
[00:13:45] Yeah.
[00:13:46] I'm going to say this just to kind of add to that point from my perspective.
[00:13:51] If you, if you've got someone that's aspiring to do something, you know, higher, the people
[00:13:57] that don't have those aspirations are more than happy to try and crush that dream for
[00:14:01] and more than happy to pull them down.
[00:14:04] And so I've found that throughout life, if you have some high aspiration that you're
[00:14:09] trying to achieve or you see someone that's got high aspirations that they're trying
[00:14:12] to achieve, you can watch the people around them.
[00:14:15] If they're not good people, we'll try to rip those things and pull them down and pull them
[00:14:19] off that track.
[00:14:21] Scary.
[00:14:22] And it's unequivocally true.
[00:14:23] I mean, it's one of the tenants, you know, I now speak on something I call the Pentagon
[00:14:27] of peak performance and the fifth level is, or I'm sorry, the fourth level is social
[00:14:32] leadership.
[00:14:33] So how we lead ourselves, how we build our ring of friends and influencers.
[00:14:37] And you're unequivocally right, a great influencer and entrepreneur I've been recently
[00:14:42] working with.
[00:14:43] He gives an amazing analogy of he was up in Alaska on a vacation.
[00:14:49] He was walking the beach and there was a fisherman that was fishing with a net and catching
[00:14:54] crabs and he was putting the crabs into bucket.
[00:14:56] And you know, it's early morning and the guy's name, Pedro's Cooleyen.
[00:15:01] And Pedro's was watching this happen, you know, early in the morning, looked in the bucket.
[00:15:05] There was about 10 crabs and probably about, you know, five gallon bucket and probably about
[00:15:10] eight inches of water.
[00:15:11] And he kept watching as one crab would climb up and grab onto the edge of the bucket and
[00:15:16] try and pull itself out.
[00:15:18] And he like tells the fisherman, hey, hey man, I want to let you know, you're going to lose
[00:15:21] one of your crabs.
[00:15:22] And the fisherman doesn't even turn around and look at him.
[00:15:25] Keeps drawn his net and he goes, watch what happens.
[00:15:29] And Pedro's kind of steps back and he looks down into the bucket and he watches his all
[00:15:34] the other crabs grab onto that other crab and pull him back down.
[00:15:39] And he had this epiphany moment of the circles of influence he had in his life and he was
[00:15:44] like, oh my god, I have crabs in my life.
[00:15:47] He's like, I have people that I want to climb up and be better and they're pulling me down.
[00:15:52] And it is unequivocally true.
[00:15:54] I mean, it's something I brought up to the bud students yesterday.
[00:15:56] I said, if you want to be the best seal, you need to surround yourself with the guys who
[00:16:02] are driven, disciplined and they're pushing themselves to the edge.
[00:16:05] If you want to go to the next level, you need to surround yourself with the guys who are
[00:16:08] either already there or they are inspired to get there.
[00:16:11] Because if you're going to surround yourself with people who are content to just drink and
[00:16:16] not move forward at all, they're going to try and pull you into that circle.
[00:16:20] Because they're going to feel threatened that you don't want to do what they're doing.
[00:16:24] And they want you to assimilate with them, verse driving forward and being successful.
[00:16:29] It's unfortunate.
[00:16:30] It's just kind of a way of life.
[00:16:31] It's a horrible situation.
[00:16:34] So watch out for it because it's everywhere.
[00:16:38] So any you end up, so you graduate high school and go to recruiter and boom, right?
[00:16:42] I mean, any other particular things around the recruitment process?
[00:16:46] Yeah, the recruitment process was actually, I actually kind of got off track a little.
[00:16:52] So I went to the recruiting station.
[00:16:54] As soon as I decided, I want to be a seal.
[00:16:56] I went to the recruiting station.
[00:16:57] It's just 15 years old.
[00:16:58] It's 95 pound weekling.
[00:17:00] And I walk into the recruiting station.
[00:17:02] And I'm like, how I want to be a seal.
[00:17:05] And there was an old crusty. I mean, he was like an old school, probably 25 year e6.
[00:17:12] And just crusty is all get out.
[00:17:15] Boatons may.
[00:17:16] And that dude basically laughed me out of the office.
[00:17:19] It was like, get out of here, stop wasting our time.
[00:17:24] You couldn't even carry the paddle much less the boat.
[00:17:27] Get out of my office.
[00:17:29] And it didn't phase me in the least.
[00:17:31] I came back next week and was like, I want to be a seal.
[00:17:34] And this guy chased me out of the office.
[00:17:38] I came back about four or five times and he just continued to not even give me the time
[00:17:42] a day.
[00:17:43] So finally, I was kind of tired of that.
[00:17:47] Either way, things are real rough when the recruiter won't give a kid the time of
[00:17:50] day.
[00:17:51] Yeah, he's trying to make that quota.
[00:17:53] This is hard core.
[00:17:54] Oh, man.
[00:17:55] Yeah.
[00:17:56] Well, I mean, you think about a 25 year e6.
[00:17:57] Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:58] He was at a point.
[00:17:59] He didn't really care.
[00:18:01] So you know, when I got to the point, I came back again, probably about eight months later.
[00:18:07] And at this point, I had, you know, really started training.
[00:18:09] I was focused on it.
[00:18:10] I didn't let him deter me.
[00:18:13] And I came back and he had left just by sheer happenstance.
[00:18:16] He was gone.
[00:18:17] And there was a new recruiter in there, a guy by the name Henry Horn.
[00:18:21] Henry, if you're out there and you listen to this, I've never been able to track him down.
[00:18:24] And thank him.
[00:18:25] But Henry took me in and was like, yeah, man, absolutely.
[00:18:28] Sit down and add this video.
[00:18:30] You may remember this.
[00:18:31] It was a B-SOME one special.
[00:18:32] And it was the cheesyest.
[00:18:35] It was like 1980s video and it's best.
[00:18:39] And it was this high speed.
[00:18:41] You know, the shields come in on a helicopter and they get out and they take down this target
[00:18:46] and take out these terrorists.
[00:18:47] And you know, the tagline is B-SOME one special.
[00:18:51] And I just ate it up, man.
[00:18:53] And came back on a regular basis and Henry was fantastic.
[00:18:58] He told me these are the things you need to do, you know, as bad fitness, this is what's
[00:19:02] going to happen.
[00:19:03] So went to go sign up.
[00:19:07] Right as I was turning 17, I was going to do the delayed entry program and I went to
[00:19:11] go sign up and went, I got back up for a second.
[00:19:18] There was a glitch.
[00:19:20] I'm sorry, I got my facts backwards here.
[00:19:22] I actually because of the deal with the crusty E-6, I was in him being a block to me.
[00:19:31] I changed my mind as I decided to go army at first.
[00:19:33] Henry happened after this, I'm sorry.
[00:19:35] I got that backwards.
[00:19:36] Henry happened after this.
[00:19:37] And when I went back, I decided to join the army.
[00:19:40] I said, well, fine, my dad, you know, he was army.
[00:19:42] The Rangers, I'll go the Greenberry route.
[00:19:45] So I went to maps to do my intake screening for the army delayed entry program.
[00:19:51] And I failed the physical because when I was a kid, I'd ruptured my ear drum.
[00:19:56] And I had a lot of scar tissue on my ear drum.
[00:19:58] And the army said, oh, well, you're not going to be able to equalize.
[00:20:01] So they tried to convince me to still go in.
[00:20:04] They were like, oh, well, you don't have to be an airborne Ranger.
[00:20:07] You know, you can do this.
[00:20:08] So you can do that.
[00:20:09] You can drive trucks.
[00:20:10] And I was like, no, man, that's not what I want to do.
[00:20:13] So I left.
[00:20:14] And I didn't sign up.
[00:20:16] And probably a couple months went by.
[00:20:18] And that's when I came back.
[00:20:21] And the crusty E6 was gone.
[00:20:22] And Henry Horn was there and really helped pave that path.
[00:20:25] So kind of an interesting road.
[00:20:27] And I think the lesson is this is there's always going to be roadblocks that are going
[00:20:32] to deter you from your dreams.
[00:20:33] You know, don't let it stop you.
[00:20:35] Keep driving forward.
[00:20:37] Because by, you know, if I just listened to that guy right for the beginning, you know,
[00:20:41] I never would have been to see a shark.
[00:20:43] So you go in and you show up at Buds.
[00:20:46] Because I like this is a good going back to the book.
[00:20:48] Your intro to Buds.
[00:20:50] One night I was asked, order to escort a member of class 199 back to his room building in 602.
[00:20:57] He'd quit the program.
[00:20:58] And the neighbor required an escort for anyone who rang the bell during hell week.
[00:21:03] I went off to find him in the darkness.
[00:21:04] He was waiting for me a smaller guy like me wrapped in a blanket.
[00:21:08] He was shivering so badly.
[00:21:09] He seemed ready to fly apart.
[00:21:11] He put the blanket over his head like a hood, giving him a monastic look.
[00:21:17] He said little so we made our way to the barracks and silence.
[00:21:20] I walked alongside him fit fit to burst wanting to get any details on what I'd
[00:21:26] soon experienced.
[00:21:27] Finally, I couldn't stand it anymore.
[00:21:29] As he reached his door and opened it, I blurred it out.
[00:21:33] So come on, man.
[00:21:34] What was it like?
[00:21:36] He turned to me and looked me in the eyes.
[00:21:38] His room's nightlight cast an orange glow across his face.
[00:21:43] His skin was waxing and he looked hollowed out.
[00:21:47] At length he answered in a slow earnest tone.
[00:21:50] Dude, it was so cold.
[00:21:52] I would have poured gasoline all over myself and little match just so I could have been warm
[00:21:57] for a few seconds before I burned to death.
[00:22:02] He stepped back without another word and slammed his door.
[00:22:05] For the first time, I wondered what I'd gotten myself into.
[00:22:11] That's legit right there.
[00:22:14] He's wrote a buzz.
[00:22:16] So there's a, so not only did that blow my mind, you know, there's a funny little side
[00:22:21] story.
[00:22:22] We actually had to edit that.
[00:22:24] So the fire thing we actually created because what he actually, he told me that exact
[00:22:30] thing.
[00:22:31] The dialogue is the same, but what he told me was about his vulgar as all get out.
[00:22:37] It would have made the bull rated triple X.
[00:22:40] And it was so mind-blowing.
[00:22:42] Because I mean, you know, the fire thing we try to come up with what is as impactful
[00:22:45] as possible.
[00:22:46] But it does not convey.
[00:22:47] I'll let your imaginations run mild.
[00:22:49] But what he told me and he slammed the door in my face left me so stunned that I was like,
[00:22:55] what the hell did I get myself into?
[00:22:57] I mean, it was, but we could not put it in the bulldozer.
[00:22:59] It was so bad. I mean, I was like, my kids can never read that.
[00:23:03] Check.
[00:23:05] Check.
[00:23:06] So anyways, I mean, then you get the butt.
[00:23:08] You go through buds and buds is cool.
[00:23:13] And you write about buds a little bit in here, but you don't spend a bunch of time on it.
[00:23:17] Because as we know, buds is not a huge part of our careers and the seal teams.
[00:23:21] And I'm going to jump right right ahead to the book here.
[00:23:27] Seven years in three South American deployments, into my career as a seal, I found myself
[00:23:31] in Fort Knox, Kentucky, working as a basic warfare instructor with a small group of fellow
[00:23:36] operators.
[00:23:37] We worked 18 hour days, but being 20 something in single, once the gear was stowed, all we wanted
[00:23:43] to do was get out on the town and blow off some steam.
[00:23:47] Work hard, play hard.
[00:23:49] That was our pre-911 mantra.
[00:23:54] The 90s teams.
[00:23:58] Work hard, play hard.
[00:24:00] I always have to explain to people how cool it is being in the teams, being in E5 and the
[00:24:06] teams.
[00:24:07] You know, what were you in E5 or any sex at this point?
[00:24:09] I was in E5.
[00:24:11] E5 and the teams.
[00:24:13] And I was telling the story the other day, this when I got to seal team one, there was,
[00:24:17] I was a new guy and I was quietly walking through the locker room trying to keep my eyes
[00:24:21] inverted from looking at anyone and I heard this guy go.
[00:24:25] Oh, yes.
[00:24:28] And I was like, oh my God.
[00:24:29] And it was this barbaric yell from this human being who is, and then I looked at him.
[00:24:36] And he was this monster guy, probably six, seven, six, six, two hundred and eighty pounds
[00:24:43] of tattooed flesh.
[00:24:46] And someone's like, what happened?
[00:24:48] And he goes, I just made E5, master chief as far as I'm concerned.
[00:24:58] So, yeah, you know, you're getting to be in E5 in a seal-patoon.
[00:25:02] You know, you've got, if you're not looking for a lot of responsibility, you won't find
[00:25:06] it.
[00:25:07] But you won't, you know, you're a little bit above some of the crap work.
[00:25:09] So it's not a bad place to be.
[00:25:12] And that's where you were doing, doing deployment after deployment, three deployments to
[00:25:17] South America.
[00:25:18] And doing the training gig.
[00:25:21] Yeah.
[00:25:22] We went training cell at the team at this time, was it already consolidated?
[00:25:26] No.
[00:25:27] Each team had a Joan individual training, still.
[00:25:29] Yep.
[00:25:30] I did that too.
[00:25:31] And this is also the time during one of these trips where you met your future one.
[00:25:36] That's right.
[00:25:37] So, you know, the seal teams are in an interesting place because being an all-male unit,
[00:25:43] you know, the only time you have an opportunity to meet people, ladies, is typically in the
[00:25:47] bars.
[00:25:49] And because we did such a good job, you know, I tell people, the mindset of the early teams
[00:25:55] really was, you know, you know, more single captured that mindset in his book, The World
[00:26:01] Warrior.
[00:26:02] But it's interesting to see post-9-11 how guys are so laser focused on combat, you
[00:26:07] know, but for us, you know, literally we trained hard.
[00:26:10] And then, you know, you were actually looked down on.
[00:26:12] If you didn't go out and party and burn it down to like four in the morning and then
[00:26:15] get an hour of sleep and get up and start training in the next day, you know, which was just
[00:26:19] stupid, you know, you weren't operating it up to more efficiency.
[00:26:23] But that was just the way it was.
[00:26:24] That was life.
[00:26:25] And, uh, accepted it and drove through.
[00:26:28] So, yeah, I was fortunate enough one night.
[00:26:30] We went into a crazy, huge bar that somebody had scouted out and said, hey, man, this
[00:26:36] is a target rich environment.
[00:26:38] And, uh, the Phoenix Hill Tavern.
[00:26:40] And, uh, went in there and yeah, beautiful, blonde walked in and I was like, I need to
[00:26:46] get to know this.
[00:26:47] She hung me.
[00:26:48] So, you did all right, man.
[00:26:52] Along, along the course of this, um, you applied for the Seaman to Admin program, which
[00:26:58] is the same program I did.
[00:26:59] I think you were a couple years behind me.
[00:27:01] And we're going to the book.
[00:27:02] I had applied to the Seaman to Admin program.
[00:27:05] Something the Navy started to encourage top performing and listed to become officers.
[00:27:09] Only 50 candidates a year were accepted back then.
[00:27:11] So, the competition was fierce.
[00:27:12] I gained a slot in the Navy sent me to college just in time to miss the outbreak of
[00:27:17] the war.
[00:27:19] I watched the towers fall.
[00:27:21] I recognized the magnitude of the moment and left school in a days fully aware that
[00:27:25] our country was heading to war with three years of college ahead of me.
[00:27:30] I feared I'd miss my chance to be a part of it.
[00:27:34] A few days later, I drove back to my old seal team to see my former CEO and mentor,
[00:27:40] Commander Vince Peterson.
[00:27:43] He had stuck his neck out for me more than once and had been instrumental in getting
[00:27:47] me a shot a slot in the Seaman Admin program.
[00:27:50] I told him I wanted to drop out of school so I could get back to a platoon and help with
[00:27:54] the war effort.
[00:27:55] Commander Peterson sat listening quietly as he, as I explained my desire to come back.
[00:28:00] He was a legend in the seal teams.
[00:28:01] He had been a former Marine before joining the Navy and headed to seal training at the age
[00:28:06] of 36.
[00:28:08] He was highly respected both up and down the chain of command.
[00:28:12] In my leadership, fence analogy, most men fell on one side of the fence or the other,
[00:28:16] while there were those small few who had the unique ability to stand on top and move back
[00:28:21] and forth.
[00:28:22] For Vince Peterson, there was no fence.
[00:28:25] As I sat down with him and asked him to put me back in the platoon, he looked me dead
[00:28:30] and the eye and said, red, this will not be a short war.
[00:28:34] It's going to go on for years and we're going to need strong warriors and leaders for
[00:28:38] upcoming battles.
[00:28:40] You need to stay in school.
[00:28:42] Then come back and lead.
[00:28:47] Check.
[00:28:50] When I read that, of course, I thought about, guess what I was doing, when 9-11 happened.
[00:28:58] I was in college as well.
[00:29:00] On the same program, I was probably a year or two ahead of you.
[00:29:03] Guess what I did?
[00:29:05] Same thing.
[00:29:06] I called the Detailer who was a friend of mine who I had worked for.
[00:29:11] I said, hey, I don't care about college.
[00:29:14] I'll do online.
[00:29:16] I don't care about any of this.
[00:29:17] Send me back to a seal team right now.
[00:29:20] Please.
[00:29:22] You know who this individual is as well.
[00:29:24] And I know who this guy is and they told me the exact same thing.
[00:29:28] He said, this war is going to last a long time.
[00:29:31] Yeah.
[00:29:32] Of course, I didn't believe it.
[00:29:34] And this is what's interesting.
[00:29:38] I recently saw the guy that I called and I saw him in his wife who I know is wife and
[00:29:43] she's a great person.
[00:29:46] And I was telling her this, telling her this.
[00:29:48] And you know what she said?
[00:29:49] It was so awesome to hear.
[00:29:52] She goes, do you know how many calls he
[00:29:54] got that day?
[00:29:56] So there was zero unique about Jocco calling the
[00:30:01] the seal detail and saying, sir, get me back to a team right now.
[00:30:05] Every single guy that wasn't in a seal team in the teams or everyone that would be
[00:30:09] built in of any kind was calling the detail and saying, get me back to a team.
[00:30:14] Put me in coach.
[00:30:15] Yeah.
[00:30:16] And it goes to that mentality.
[00:30:17] You're talking about we were.
[00:30:20] You were just training and training and training and be like training for a game and
[00:30:26] training for the Super Bowl never getting play.
[00:30:28] Yeah.
[00:30:30] So you actually did a great job in college and you were an ROTC too, right?
[00:30:38] I was.
[00:30:39] Yeah.
[00:30:40] So I got the real scam deal where I just went to college and wasn't wearing a uniform.
[00:30:43] I was like far enough ahead of you that I got the deal.
[00:30:46] You were in the original program.
[00:30:48] So you got a commission and went to school as an officer.
[00:30:50] So you were getting paid off your page.
[00:30:52] I got to school.
[00:30:53] I got the most ridiculous deal.
[00:30:55] I apologize to the tax payers.
[00:30:56] Yeah.
[00:30:57] I think and the Navy quickly realized.
[00:30:59] Yeah.
[00:31:00] Okay.
[00:31:01] Yeah.
[00:31:02] We screwed this one up.
[00:31:03] I think it took them two iterations.
[00:31:04] Yeah.
[00:31:05] I was in because I think I was in the third iteration, third or fourth.
[00:31:07] But no.
[00:31:08] We actually were required to be a part of ROTC.
[00:31:12] So you know, every day we were up early and we and the Hampton Road General T.C.
[00:31:17] At that time, it was the largest ROTC consortium on the East Coast.
[00:31:21] So you had Hampton University.
[00:31:23] You had O.D.
[00:31:24] You old and mid-New University and you had Norfolk State.
[00:31:26] And they had at that time probably about I think we were at about 330 midshipmen and
[00:31:33] officer candidates.
[00:31:34] And we had a huge contingent of ex-inlisted.
[00:31:38] So there was actually, it was probably six or seven seals in the program there at that
[00:31:43] time.
[00:31:44] So it was good.
[00:31:49] We played all the games.
[00:31:50] Real quickly, I realized I said, okay, you know, they want it.
[00:31:53] You've got to step up.
[00:31:54] You know, they're going to put you into these different positions.
[00:31:57] And a lot of the guys had come there before me were kind of like, no, dude, we don't
[00:32:01] want to do anything.
[00:32:02] We don't want to be involved.
[00:32:03] We just want to, you know, a lot of times typical team guys.
[00:32:05] We want to create our own little circle of trust.
[00:32:09] And we don't want to let anybody else in the circle.
[00:32:11] And I was like, no, man.
[00:32:13] We had chains at mindset.
[00:32:14] There's young kids here that we could influence to become future frog men.
[00:32:18] I said, and because there was no, that all these communities at the school, they had,
[00:32:23] they had, you know, surface warfare community, they had the aviation club, they had the submariner
[00:32:28] club.
[00:32:29] But there was no special operations club.
[00:32:32] And there were young kids who were interested.
[00:32:34] And I said, what we need to create this, you know, we have the experience.
[00:32:37] We can help these kids.
[00:32:38] And then the other thing I said is I said, well, you know, I'm going to try and
[00:32:43] step up into leadership positions.
[00:32:45] And I think all the rest of us should do the same.
[00:32:47] And thankfully, you know, it worked.
[00:32:49] We all jumped on board.
[00:32:50] And, you know, I was fortunate.
[00:32:52] I did excel in school.
[00:32:54] And I ended up leaving the school as the student Italian commanding officer prior to being commissioned.
[00:33:00] Damn.
[00:33:02] I was the regimental commander at Officer Candidate School.
[00:33:07] And that was, you know, the number one position.
[00:33:10] Yeah.
[00:33:11] And I was.
[00:33:12] Yeah, I was talking to my mom.
[00:33:17] And I, I mentioned to which I shouldn't have done because my mom just doesn't understand.
[00:33:22] I was like, well, yeah, I'm, you know, I'm the, the regiment.
[00:33:25] She's, because at the last couple of weeks, I was yes.
[00:33:27] And I, she said, oh, so what's going on now?
[00:33:30] Because then I could call, because you weren't allowed to call.
[00:33:32] So I said, well, we're doing this.
[00:33:33] And I'm in charge of the thing here.
[00:33:35] It's called the regimental commander.
[00:33:37] And she goes, oh, what?
[00:33:39] What? But so you're the commander. And I said, yeah, the regimental commander.
[00:33:43] She goes, what do you in charge of?
[00:33:45] And I said, I am overseeing the cleaning of every toilet.
[00:33:50] And Officer Candidate School.
[00:33:51] And it's going quite well.
[00:33:52] So spotless spotless.
[00:33:56] Uh, you, so you do a great job in college.
[00:34:00] And now you go back to the teams after college going back to the book.
[00:34:05] Instead of having an advantage, I found myself left behind.
[00:34:10] Everything had changed.
[00:34:11] And as our platoon went through its training cycle, I always felt like I was playing catch-up.
[00:34:16] I made mistakes and exercises that I never made in the 90s.
[00:34:20] They made me edgy and tense, feeling the pressure of trying to be a leader and drinking from
[00:34:25] that training fire hose at the same time.
[00:34:28] I got tight and held on even harder, which only made things worse.
[00:34:34] And our time off, I drowned my frustrations and booze and routinely made an ass of myself.
[00:34:40] None of this was helping my credibility with the men I was supposed to be leading.
[00:34:44] But I didn't see that at the moment.
[00:34:47] It also didn't help that senior chief Pete Kerry and I despised each other almost from
[00:34:52] our introduction.
[00:34:54] He was a good skilled seal and I respected his tactical abilities, but I felt his people
[00:34:59] skills were lacking.
[00:35:00] And I was afraid of a lot of abrasive at times, his leadership style clashed with mine,
[00:35:03] which set us on a collision course.
[00:35:07] While I privately railed against Kerry, I was too blinded by arrogance to see my own flaws.
[00:35:13] I wasn't making a good transition to being an officer.
[00:35:16] I'd been enlisted for so long.
[00:35:17] I identified with mine listed teammates more as one of them, rather than as one of their
[00:35:22] leaders.
[00:35:24] It put me too far away from the fence.
[00:35:27] The senior chief and the AOIC are supposed to work closely together to make sure the team
[00:35:32] functions effectively.
[00:35:34] The AOIC and that's a system officer in charge is also supposed to learn from the chief's
[00:35:39] tactical experience.
[00:35:41] That never happened in Arpaltoon.
[00:35:42] Instead, I refused to humble myself and listen to the senior chief.
[00:35:46] As the pre-depulment work up war on, we couldn't conceal our dislike for each other.
[00:35:52] The feud spilled out into the open and culminated with a public screaming match in Europe after
[00:35:58] a tactical exercise with some NATO allies.
[00:36:03] In the weeks that followed my arrival within the team, our relationship became the cancer
[00:36:07] in our locker room.
[00:36:08] By the time we got to Afghanistan, we refused to be civilly to each other.
[00:36:12] I had lost touch entirely with what it meant to be a leader.
[00:36:15] During the daily briefs, we would openly take shots at each other.
[00:36:18] I talked about this dynamic many times with my superior, the Patoons Officer in charge.
[00:36:23] One day, the AOIC finally said, look, you do have to work to this out.
[00:36:28] I'm tired of it.
[00:36:29] We never could or did work things out.
[00:36:33] Different Patoons, structure things in different ways.
[00:36:35] In Arpaltoon, senior and elistic members acted as fire team leaders with chiefs and some
[00:36:39] more experienced officers acting as the assault force commanders.
[00:36:42] I'd been assigned as neither.
[00:36:44] If I'd taken a step back, I might have realized that I hadn't given my bosses much
[00:36:48] confidence in my leadership, but I didn't see that.
[00:36:51] I only felt slighted and in bitter.
[00:36:56] Rough tour.
[00:36:59] But all brought on by myself.
[00:37:01] The dynamics obviously created some interesting problems.
[00:37:09] As often happens, I wasn't taking ownership of my own actions.
[00:37:15] Instead, I was just trying to point fingers externally.
[00:37:18] It's peak Gary's fault that these things are happening.
[00:37:22] When the reality was 80% of it was me.
[00:37:27] 80% of it.
[00:37:29] It's one of the things that I talk to a lot of individuals about.
[00:37:32] I think you see it in special operations.
[00:37:34] You and I have both of spoken to professional sports teams.
[00:37:39] I see it there where young men accelerate quickly and achieve this elite status.
[00:37:44] And then get a little bit of enamored with who they are and their abilities.
[00:37:49] And lose sight of the end state, which is to be an effective part of the team to do their
[00:37:55] job so ruthlessly well, it plays this huge part in the team.
[00:37:59] At the end of the day, whether you're in professional sports, whether you're in the
[00:38:03] SEAL teams, or either whether you're in some elite business, that's what has to happen.
[00:38:09] And I lost sight of that.
[00:38:16] And more focused externally, instead of internally.
[00:38:19] And really, now I speak a lot on what my three rules of leadership is and the foundational
[00:38:21] the first rule is lead yourself.
[00:38:25] And how you lead yourself, 80% of leadership is leading yourself.
[00:38:30] You talk so much about discipline.
[00:38:31] It's how you discipline yourself.
[00:38:33] It's how you structure yourself.
[00:38:34] It's how you push yourself.
[00:38:35] It's how you set the example.
[00:38:41] And in doing so, it automatically leads to rule number two, lead others.
[00:38:43] It almost makes it easy to lead others because you've already done all the work.
[00:38:46] They want to follow you because you're setting the example.
[00:38:49] I kind of had it backwards.
[00:38:50] I was trying to lead others, but I wasn't leading myself.
[00:38:54] And it's almost impossible to do.
[00:38:56] And I meet all these people that have gone out in business and talked to them and they say,
[00:39:01] hey man, how do I be a better leader?
[00:39:07] Because that's where I really, really failed.
[00:39:12] We talk in several times you've mentioned a principle I talk about called the leadership
[00:39:16] fence.
[00:39:18] And a leadership fence was just kind of a concept that came up with after watching a lot
[00:39:22] of really good leaders and bad leaders, including myself in that category.
[00:39:28] Years later, I looked back.
[00:39:29] And the idea was this, that imagine a chain link fence.
[00:39:33] And that fence represents where you are in your leadership journey.
[00:39:37] And on one side of the fence are all those you lead and on the other side are those
[00:39:42] you report to your peers.
[00:39:45] Everybody has a natural tendency to kind of fall on one side of the fence or the other
[00:39:49] depending on how they grew up or how they came into the organization.
[00:39:53] For me, obviously, when you start out as anyone, I connected a lot more with the guys
[00:39:59] on the side of the fence that I was leading.
[00:40:02] As a matter of fact, the teams back then typically wanted to switch coasts with guys.
[00:40:09] Bjorn and Lys guy, they wanted to send you out to the opposite coast.
[00:40:12] And that didn't happen for me.
[00:40:14] And I tell you what, I look back on that now and I think that was a mistake.
[00:40:18] I created a lot of my own problems and the seal teams were right in there thinking
[00:40:23] on how to do that.
[00:40:24] Because now the hardest leadership often is peer leadership to break through those bonds
[00:40:30] of hey, you and I were both friends, but now I'm in charge of you.
[00:40:34] So how do we navigate that water?
[00:40:36] And if you're close with those people, it makes it a lot more difficult.
[00:40:40] You have to be the one that really has to break those bonds.
[00:40:43] And sometimes a can damage friendships if you're not careful with that.
[00:40:47] And I think I was more focused on retaining that.
[00:40:49] So that was on one side of the fence.
[00:40:51] And those side of fence a lot of times, you see individuals that come into an organization
[00:40:55] later at a higher leadership position.
[00:40:58] So they get brought in as an officer, they get brought in as a leader to a company.
[00:41:02] And they're more focused on that leadership position that they don't take the time to get
[00:41:07] to know the people they're leading.
[00:41:10] So they're too far away from the fence.
[00:41:11] It's a chain link fence so that you can talk through it so that you can communicate through
[00:41:16] it.
[00:41:17] And the best leaders have the ability to be right up against that fence.
[00:41:20] So whether they're on either side, they're able to turn around and gain guidance from the
[00:41:26] individuals, whether it's their leadership and communicate it through to those they lead,
[00:41:30] or whether they're on the side of communicating and interacting with those they lead and
[00:41:34] communicating through and getting guidance from who they follow.
[00:41:40] Problems arise when you're too far away from the fence.
[00:41:43] The leaders who are so far on the other side of the fence and all they're thinking about
[00:41:47] is how do I make the next rank?
[00:41:50] We know who they are.
[00:41:51] I mean we've seen those guys who literally you think, man, you would like kill your mother
[00:41:55] to make the next rank to be this or be that.
[00:41:59] And then we also know those guys who they have no aspirations to try and get better on the
[00:42:04] other side of the fence.
[00:42:05] I mean we joke about the career E5s, the perfectly content.
[00:42:10] The magic position and the seal teams where you're at that level where you're high enough
[00:42:16] above to not do the groundwork but you don't really have tremendous responsibilities.
[00:42:20] I was way too far away.
[00:42:22] That was the bottom line and this is where I was tremendously failing and not setting the
[00:42:26] example.
[00:42:27] I wasn't communicating with the leadership.
[00:42:32] They were trying to provide me guidance and basically saying, hey dude, you're screwing things
[00:42:36] up and even Pete Carrey himself was trying to convey to me in his very abrasive way.
[00:42:43] They do it, you know, this is not the way you do things but I was blinded both by having
[00:42:50] excelled at this point in my career really rocketing up and thinking, oh I know these things,
[00:42:57] you know I'm the man.
[00:43:00] So humility is such a critical component of leadership to take that step back and if anybody
[00:43:04] is given you advice, always take a second to think through it and evaluate, hey, even
[00:43:11] if maybe you don't think it applies, there's probably pieces of it that do.
[00:43:15] That's the reality.
[00:43:16] Yeah, I was with someone's giving me critique points, you know and of course and it's
[00:43:21] every single I say every single person on earth doesn't like receiving critique like
[00:43:27] and I always joke about the fact that even when someone asks for criticism, when they get
[00:43:32] it, they still get mad.
[00:43:33] Even I say, hey Jay, would you, you know, read this thing that I just wrote and tell me
[00:43:36] what you think of it and then you read it and you say, you know, I thought it was a little
[00:43:39] you could do this a little bit better. I'm going to be mad, right? Everyone gets mad.
[00:43:44] And so that's so what I do is the same thing. I take a step back when somebody gives
[00:43:48] me a critique point, even though I'm completely offended and I don't agree with them
[00:43:52] and I think I'm right because I'm an egotistical maniac.
[00:43:55] I put all that aside and I say, wait a second, there's a reason that they're telling
[00:43:58] me this, there's gotta be some truth to it.
[00:44:01] I like, I'm one of my favorite things about this book is the fact that it reveals the
[00:44:09] difficulties that we have in the Syltimes which are the same difficulties that I see all
[00:44:14] the time. So people think, oh, and you're in the Syltimes, everyone's just perfect.
[00:44:18] And you know, this, this, p, carry would be the perfect mentor and you'd just be able to
[00:44:24] come along and then you'd be the perfect recipient, the perfect mentee, ready to learn
[00:44:30] and everything's just perfect and it's actually completely untrue and what you have in
[00:44:35] the Syltimes actually in the, like, in the civilian sector and companies and organizations,
[00:44:41] they have these personality, you know, different personalities in the Syltimes and so you
[00:44:45] think, oh, in the Syltimes, you don't have that. No, you actually have it worse because
[00:44:48] you got these guys that have, that have really built their egos been built up and we all
[00:44:53] think we're great. We all think we're tactical genius. We all think we don't have anything
[00:44:56] to learn and so we have a lot of issues around this exact kind of thing and it does completely
[00:45:05] derail, not just leaders, but it derails, p, tunes and I mean, we would disband p, tunes.
[00:45:11] And when we were disband, p, tune, that means the p, tune is no longer going to exist.
[00:45:14] We'd have a p, tune coming through training. The p, tune would get disbanded. It doesn't
[00:45:18] happen very often, but it happens. Yeah. And when it happens, it has zero to do with the
[00:45:25] e-force e-fives and usually the e-sixes and it has a hundred percent to do with the senior
[00:45:29] e-sixes, the chiefs and the officers inside the p, tune that just our disasters. And it
[00:45:36] does happen and I think the fact that you, the fact that you talk through some of these
[00:45:40] issues are, I mean, that's what that's what's very revealing about the Syltimes in this
[00:45:46] book is like, hey, we got, you know, we got the same issues that they have in other
[00:45:52] or any other team, any other organization. And that, that, you know, that thing that you
[00:45:58] talk about this, this fence, you know, that's to me. That's the dichotomy leadership, right?
[00:46:02] That's like, you can go to foreign one direction or the other. And if you go to foreign
[00:46:05] one direction or the other, you're going to fall apart. Yeah. So check. All right. Now you're
[00:46:14] on deployment. And I've got to say, and I always, I always mentioned this. I haven't
[00:46:19] mentioned it yet, but I'll mention it right now because I'm only reading small portions
[00:46:24] of this book and there's so much more great detail in the book. And you'll have a better
[00:46:29] understanding of these lessons when you, when you read the whole thing. So if it seems a
[00:46:34] little bit, you know, it seems it's jumping around a little bit. It's just because I'm
[00:46:37] only reading chunks of it because I'm not going to read the whole damn book. You can read
[00:46:40] it yourself. All right. So now speaking of jumping around, you're in Afghanistan. You had
[00:46:46] a mission go down where it sounded like you guys got some bad intel and it caused a little
[00:46:53] of a problem. You hit the target pretty hard and you guys got put on an operational pause.
[00:46:58] Meaning, hey, you guys aren't going to do anything. And that's a great story and how that
[00:47:03] unfolds is great and people should read so they can learn lessons from that. But then I'm
[00:47:08] going to go skip a lesson here. You are in the chow hall and you're sitting with some
[00:47:15] of your boys. And I'm specifically using that term because at this point, you definitely
[00:47:20] are, we're boys with the boys and I'm going to the book. I've been searching for a way
[00:47:24] to prove myself ever since I'd come aboard. Now the opportunity to do so had just fallen
[00:47:30] into my lap. I had to take it. In time, I learned there was nothing more dangerous on the
[00:47:35] battlefield than an immature and arrogant officer who feels he needs to prove himself. It
[00:47:41] can lead men to their death. And what you're looking at is you happen to be sitting in the
[00:47:45] chow hall with the commanding general. And these guys kind of, your, your boys kind of
[00:47:52] egg you on to go talk to him about, hey, why are we, why are we standing down in your
[00:47:58] and incident at this point? Yeah. Oh, Jesus. Okay. So here we go. I walked over and stood
[00:48:04] beside the general's table. Excuse me, general. Encin redmond, naval special warfare. Do
[00:48:09] you have a couple of minutes? His aides gloured up at me stamped on their faces is a
[00:48:14] crew the hell are you. Look, that made me momentarily waver. The general invited me to sit
[00:48:20] down. His aides looked frosted and grew more so after I began to talk. Sorry, I just wanted
[00:48:25] to talk to you about this operational pause. We still seem to be in. I began. The general's
[00:48:30] face registering nothing but interest. I continued. I know there was a miscommunication
[00:48:35] with our first mission, but we know the enemies out there and we'd really like to take the
[00:48:38] opportunity to go after them. The general heard me out, then replied diplomatically. Well,
[00:48:43] Johnson, I've got to look at all the strategic factors here. We must always weigh the
[00:48:47] strategic impact with the impact on the civilian populace and there are implications
[00:48:51] to going out and operating at night. I understand that, sir. Right now, we're at a crazy
[00:48:56] time in the war and we have to balance what we're doing. Well, general, I said, I can hardly
[00:49:02] read that with a straight face. Well, general, I said, we really feel like we can contribute
[00:49:07] in a positive way to by going after the men who pose a clear and present threat to coalition
[00:49:11] forces. General's non-committal, but remained polite. I don't think his AIDS took their eyes
[00:49:16] off me through the entire conversation. I could feel them boring holes through me. I
[00:49:20] thanked them for their time got up and headed back to my table. The other two operators
[00:49:25] were gone. Why hadn't they stuck around? Get some. Yeah, beware of peer pressure.
[00:49:40] Beware, once again, it comes back to that lead yourself, lead yourself that founding principle.
[00:49:47] Because this was a dangerous thing and I did this several times during that deployment.
[00:49:54] This misunderstanding or this idea that somehow there's this shortcut to being an effective
[00:50:01] leader that there's this push button easy button that, look at me, now I'm a great leader
[00:50:06] and this really was this moment. People understand this was an interesting time. This was
[00:50:16] July of 2005. June 28, the 2005 operation Red Wings had just happened and that was our
[00:50:25] troop. We had lost five of our guys including our troop commander. We had lost my error
[00:50:33] Christian sin. We had lost my good friend in the OIC at that platoon, Mike McGreevey.
[00:50:38] I originally was in Echo Platoon. We had trained alongside those guys. We were all grieving
[00:50:46] and we all wanted revenge. We all wanted to go after the enemy. The very first mission we
[00:50:53] did was the mission you talked about that got us in a little bit of trouble. Now take the
[00:50:59] dynamics of everybody grieving because of the loss of our teammates and then doing our
[00:51:08] first mission and being put in hack because of really some outstanding issues that you
[00:51:14] can read about in the book. We had actually done everything right but it kind of got
[00:51:18] placed back on us. I just, it's these moments that as a young leader, whether you're in
[00:51:24] the business, whether you're in the military law enforcement, whatever you do that you
[00:51:29] see this shortcut. Oh look what I can do. It got fueled when my teammates and I sat there
[00:51:37] and started talking and teammates were the biggest chitalkers on the planet. They definitely
[00:51:46] were agonized and I ate it up. Hook line and sinker and I was like you are absolutely right.
[00:51:50] There is a great opportunity for me to shed some amazing wisdom and insight to this general
[00:51:58] where he now is going to be like oh young innocent you're so right. We should absolutely
[00:52:02] allow you guys to go out and conduct all these operations because I'm not smart enough
[00:52:08] to allow this to happen. The arrogance that I had and really sad that I didn't think
[00:52:14] through what are the implications of this for you to go do that.
[00:52:19] It was just a stupid decision and I realized it. As soon as those guys were gone like
[00:52:26] all the sudden I'm like, huh. What did you just do more on? And as I walk back from
[00:52:35] the chial hall to our camp, I was like this isn't going to go on. You didn't told your
[00:52:43] boss that you did it right. I did it. I was straight back to my CEO and I said hey I want
[00:52:47] to let you know what just happened. I thought it was a good idea and I don't think it
[00:52:56] was. It was funny. He kind of looked at me and he said why did you think that was a good
[00:53:03] idea? And I said why I was doing it for the boys. It was about the boys. You really
[00:53:13] wasn't. At the end of the day it was about me and that's where you know really understanding
[00:53:20] that you know in leadership you are the last point in the equation and don't get me wrong.
[00:53:27] You know there's an overlap of everything that happens that we do. So oftentimes you're
[00:53:31] focused on the mission you're focused on the man and of course by doing that well there
[00:53:35] is a positive impact for you and there's nothing wrong with that. But that thought process
[00:53:40] it should be it should be by sequence if you will not because you're focused on it.
[00:53:46] Yeah no 100% and you're right the by product of focusing on your people and focusing on
[00:53:51] your mission the by product of that is you'll be successful and the contrary the contrary
[00:53:56] in situation is literally if you focus on yourself instead of your people and your mission
[00:54:02] you will fail you will you and you know what fails a strong word because there's people
[00:54:08] and you and I know them who have focused on themselves and they they they they can win
[00:54:12] this battle and they can win this tactical battle and they can win this tactical battle
[00:54:15] and they can get to a certain point but eventually it will come back on them and you won't
[00:54:21] be as truly successful as if you would as you would have been had you focused on the
[00:54:26] man the mission and not focused on yourself. I call those people leadership wrecking balls
[00:54:33] they're good at what they do you know in some ways peak carriers one of those people
[00:54:38] he was very good at what he did and he got things done but he had a tendency to leave
[00:54:44] and a lot of organizations have these individuals and they keep them around because
[00:54:49] they do get things done but they leave a path of destruction behind them and over time
[00:54:53] people don't want to work with them and you know that's why I call them the leadership
[00:54:57] wrecking ball so you know I tell people you need to evaluate yourself are you one of those
[00:55:01] people do you turn around you know forward you look at the successes you have but you turn
[00:55:05] around and look and there's a path of destruction going away there no doubt about it.
[00:55:10] All right so you guys eventually do get back in the game you the the pause operational
[00:55:16] pause gets lifted and you guys are operating again and here you are out on an operation
[00:55:22] you're in an Overwatch position on a hilltop going back to the book between bursts
[00:55:27] of gunfire I heard in report troops and contact troops and contact we're facing at least
[00:55:32] 20 enemy fighters a wash of static followed then I heard Joker add one of our afghan soldiers
[00:55:38] is wounded we need reinforcements.
[00:55:42] Jay here's your chance your teammates are in trouble I looked down into the value thousand
[00:55:47] feet below the slope was steep perhaps 60 degrees in places getting down there would be a
[00:55:52] serious climb once at the bottom we'd have to maneuver to the sound of the guns through broken
[00:55:58] terrain and vegetation that would complicate approaching our guys without getting shot by accident.
[00:56:03] I called the Fred and asked if the western Overwatch team was still in place gunfire erupted
[00:56:09] over the radio as he heat his mic and answered I think so okay good that gave us eyes above
[00:56:15] and control over the high ground over there this is the moment Jay go prove yourself
[00:56:20] as we dropped off the lip senior chief carry called to me over the radio and wanted to know
[00:56:27] what I was doing we're going down I told him he went ballistic absolutely not we need to link
[00:56:34] back up fall back the boys needed help and we were closest if it had been anybody else I might
[00:56:42] have thought twice about his call but my own personal quest to prove myself coupled with my
[00:56:47] intense hatred for him clouded my judgment I ignored him and we pressed on as we dropped further into
[00:56:55] the valley we lost all communication with the headquarters team I began to realize what a
[00:57:00] hairy situation I had just placed the two of us in we had given up the high ground to move down
[00:57:05] a thousand feet of vertical terrain to try and link up with an element under fire with an enemy
[00:57:10] force almost one kilometer away I pushed this thought to the back of my mind the boys need help
[00:57:16] focus on that but where was the fight the sounds of battle echoed all across the valley making it
[00:57:22] difficult to calculate distance and direction a broken transmission filled my earpiece I couldn't
[00:57:28] tell what it was but I recognized Jaydee's voice I tried to establish contact a moment later
[00:57:34] through washers of static Jaydee's voice came back where the hell are you Jaydee demanded
[00:57:40] I told him we were at the tea intersection on the valley floor get your ass out of the valley now
[00:57:45] he said with so much anger I could almost feel a blast of fire shoot out of the earpiece I was
[00:57:50] about to explain my intent when he added those guys are in a major fight and we can't call in
[00:57:55] close air support because we don't know where you are that shook me there were aircraft over
[00:58:03] head waiting to join the battle with rockets and bombs yet they could not make their runs because
[00:58:08] of my decision to go into the valley I should have thought about art air assets but I was too blinded
[00:58:15] by my own ambition with my combat experience on full display it started to dawn on me at last
[00:58:22] had I made a mistake what if somebody got hit during the delay I'd caused I'd keep my radio and
[00:58:27] reported that we would be pulling out of the valley and climbing up the north face of the
[00:58:31] tea intersection to link up with our element there once we were consolidated on the north ridge
[00:58:37] and our security was set for what was surely be a long night ahead Jaydee came looking for me
[00:58:42] as he approached I could see he was livid what the hell were you doing and dignitely I told him I
[00:58:48] was trying to go to the aid of my brothers he looked at me like I just spit on his wife
[00:58:54] that was a stupid thing you did red you could have gotten people killed his words made me even
[00:59:00] more right to sleep in dignity I fired back at him the boys were in trouble and I went to their
[00:59:05] aid I did what I needed to be done in the moment Jaydee refused to accept that I tossed out a
[00:59:11] similar situation that occurred in Afghanistan a few years before as if established establishing
[00:59:16] precedence would help my case Jaydee knew the mission too and he cut me off with not the
[00:59:21] same at all red they didn't have air support available I didn't know I know he did I shouted back
[00:59:27] you delayed it with what you did Jaydee roared at last when it was clear to Jaydee that his words
[00:59:33] were not sinking in he ended the argument currently he said we'll deal this when we after when we
[00:59:38] get back to Canada hard he turned and stalked off I watched him leave and struggled with my own
[00:59:44] thoughts had I really made that big of a mistake no no way I went to help when is that ever wrong
[00:59:58] bro that's rough you know a lot of people read that section who don't have
[01:00:07] tactical background and they don't fully understand they're like oh man no you did the heroic thing
[01:00:13] you went down into the battle you know you tried to take the fight to the enemy but
[01:00:17] no I tried to explain to them you know you don't have a tactical understanding you know there are so
[01:00:21] many things that were done wrong there that it literally and this story would be so different
[01:00:29] if something had actually happened and the potential for something to have gone wrong is true
[01:00:34] the roof I mean you've been an Afghanist and I mean you know the fighting positions and basically
[01:00:39] I took myself off a very advantageous high ground position that we owned down into the valley
[01:00:45] a thousand feet below I mean there could have been hundreds of fighting positions and caves above
[01:00:50] me that any one single fighter could have just decimated us and I know what have been one thing
[01:00:55] if I got myself killed but I pulled a young team guy machine gunner down with me so I placed this
[01:01:02] guy's life in jeopardy and you know the funny thing is you know I tried to paint it in that moment
[01:01:09] arguing with J.D that I was doing the right thing I'm taking the fight to the enemy I'm you know
[01:01:14] supporting my brothers and all this BS you know the reality was I wanted to get in the fight
[01:01:20] at that point I had been on the edge of a lot of fire fights and you know and even
[01:01:26] fighting I'm in until you get in there you haven't proved yourself and I wanted to prove myself
[01:01:33] I wanted to prove myself both as a seal as a fighter and as a leader and this was another moment
[01:01:40] just like the general where I thought here's my opportunity and and I was so unwilling to listen
[01:01:51] you know that I had made a mistake and the reality is if I had owned it in that moment it probably
[01:01:57] would not have been as bad as it was but the mere fact that I just planted my flag on that spot and
[01:02:04] was like screw you you're wrong I'm right and I did the right thing I think just turned what was
[01:02:11] a fire into a raging inferno yeah yeah no that's definitely rough and I think also
[01:02:22] from a from a tactical perspective people make mistakes like this like it can happen and it can
[01:02:28] happen and you know I talk about being able to detach and that's something that I definitely learned
[01:02:33] in the seal teams and it was I think one of the most advantageous skills for a leader especially
[01:02:40] a combat leader to have is to be able to to step back from the situation as it's unfolding
[01:02:46] because if you fully knew hey we've got air overhead and they're in a firefight and if I go
[01:02:54] down there we won't be able to use air support you wouldn't have done this even even a 60
[01:03:01] gunner you know even a pig gunner would say oh okay no I need to I need to let that that unfold
[01:03:06] but you know you're excited to get down there and and get in the fight is definitely you know
[01:03:13] let's something that that can grab a hold of of anyone if they're not careful and and again
[01:03:20] it's what we just talked about with you at that moment put yourself ahead of the mission ahead of
[01:03:25] the team and and then yeah I mean this idea of ownership and you know when I when I
[01:03:32] kick off the book that I wrote with a extreme ownership you know kicks off with a blue on blue
[01:03:38] and you know it was it was a lot of bad things happening there was a lot of moving parts going on
[01:03:43] it was a horrible situation and a rocky soldier got killed several more got wounded one of my
[01:03:47] guys got wounded and I can tell you right now like I think if I would have said hey this wasn't
[01:03:54] my fault blame it on someone else I think I would have gotten fired about in about three seconds
[01:03:59] because it's just a it's a bad situation unfold and yeah you plant in the flag on that is
[01:04:08] is rough and and I mean your humility and putting this out there is awesome and people can
[01:04:15] learn so much from that because if you recognize how easily you and you know okay let's let's
[01:04:20] let's paint you in a bad light that you were young and you were but let's paint you in a good
[01:04:24] light even with you had those qualities of being hyper aggressive and you wanted to get in the
[01:04:28] fight and and you're you were a little bit arrogant you're still a team guy that's trying to do
[01:04:32] good job but wasn't like you were trying to do a bad job so to recognize like hey even if you're
[01:04:37] well-intentioned if you don't pay attention to these things they can grab hold of you and they can
[01:04:43] pull you in a wrong direction and and you look up and and you're you're you're planting your flag
[01:04:48] and and putting up your defenses around an indefensible position which is where you ended up here
[01:04:54] and and you nailed it with the idea you know it's something I know you talked people about a business
[01:05:00] I talk about I think it's no different probably and fighting you know you've got to let the
[01:05:05] battle feel developed sometimes we have this natural instinct that when something bad happens when
[01:05:11] a crisis happens we feel this you know oh my god I got to react immediately before we actually
[01:05:16] take the time and even in a gunfight you typically have a few seconds and it's amazing how much
[01:05:22] information we can process in a few seconds before we react and move and so that was one problem
[01:05:31] and the other problem and you know was I was driven by this relationship
[01:05:39] issue and it's funny you know the individual the retired master chief that you were with on you know
[01:05:45] Thursday who was I served under him twice later we had talked about that exact situation
[01:05:52] and he had given me advice later and he said never let your personal feelings get in the way of
[01:05:57] your professional relationships and I had I absolutely let my personal feelings drive that and that
[01:06:03] was probably the biggest eff you moment you know like I said if it'd been anybody else but my
[01:06:08] hatred for him had grown to the point that I was just like you know let me show you buddy you know and
[01:06:14] so all these things you know dangerous you know that not only did you know all these things you
[01:06:19] have to be careful of I mean this is what falls under you know a lot of people call these different
[01:06:24] things and my Pentagon of peak performance I call it emotional leadership so your ability to
[01:06:29] attach yourself for a second and say okay I'm not going to let my own personal feelings drive this
[01:06:33] because what's going on around me my ability to lead and make the right decisions is more critical
[01:06:38] than what I feel and obviously you know I had not learned those lessons yet I was on that
[01:06:45] on that glide path and at this point I was on the glide path down I was crashing and burning rough rough
[01:06:52] going back to the book back at Canahar I heard the first whispers about me floating around the team
[01:06:57] the men had nicknamed me Rambo Red though some may think being compared to Stallone's lone wolf
[01:07:03] silver screen icon was a compliment with our community it was a supreme insult in the seal teams there's
[01:07:09] no room for individualism foundations of our success rest on mutual cooperation and communication
[01:07:17] alone wolf like Rambo could destroy a team with catastrophic effects on the battlefield
[01:07:24] after we debriefed the mission J.D. Richardson took me into his makeshift's office and said
[01:07:30] red your operational abilities have been called into question we're sending you back to
[01:07:33] the bathroom to meet with the seal and we'll discuss this further when the rest of the team gets back. I was stunned
[01:07:40] at worst I was starting to expect something more than a wrist slap but nothing like that.
[01:07:46] I was being sent back to the rear out of combat nothing can ever be more humiliating for a warrior
[01:07:54] I trained my entire adult life for this and now I had been told I didn't measure up.
[01:07:58] I felt like a mule kick to the gut. I heard rumblings that senior chief carry wanted to see my
[01:08:06] triedent taken away. Behind the scenes he was pushing for a triedent review board to determine my
[01:08:13] fate the months of infighting between us had been bad enough now he was trying to destroy my career.
[01:08:20] I was sick at the thought of losing my triedent over a single bad moment in a valley whose
[01:08:30] name nobody back home would ever know and whose location would not matter to anyone but a handful
[01:08:35] of men who had fought in it. Ensign Redmond had demonstrated a consistent pattern of bad decision
[01:08:42] making. I fought again about my screaming match with senior chief carry during the NATO exercise.
[01:08:47] When it ended what did I see in the eyes of what did I see in the eyes of my teammates?
[01:08:53] Embarrassment. This wasn't really about one moment in the valley was it Jay. I had to face that
[01:09:00] fact I rubbed my ankle temples. I felt like my head was going to explode from the pressure building
[01:09:06] inside of it my life was being destroyed and I had made myself vulnerable to these attacks with my
[01:09:10] own actions. If I was allowed to continue to operate stories of this deployment which circulate through
[01:09:16] the teams. If I go to my next platoon with my reputation and tatters who would follow my lead.
[01:09:24] Sitting neatly on the wooden crossbar on the floor beside my bed my holstered
[01:09:30] sick sour p226 sat well-oiled and cleaned. I leaned over and pulled it out.
[01:09:38] I knew around was already in the chamber but I drew back the slide and took a look to make sure.
[01:09:46] We called this a press check and it confirmed what I already knew. My gun was ready to go.
[01:09:53] As I held the pistol I fought of the great samurai warriors who if disgraced would commit ritual suicide.
[01:10:02] Part of me willed my hand to raise the sig to press it firmly to my temple.
[01:10:06] My life is over. There's nothing left but an honorable exit.
[01:10:14] I glanced over at the desk and saw a picture of my beautiful life, Erica.
[01:10:18] The image of her face riveted my attention. Her easy-going smile, her eyes, a light and lively,
[01:10:24] always quick to laugh and offer love and compassion. What would this do to her? After all she
[01:10:32] sacrificed for me, would my death snuff out the life of her gorgeous eyes? With the bullet
[01:10:39] I put in my temple. I'd leave her the burden of my failed career and it took it to a lifetime
[01:10:45] of grief. The kids would live under that cloud as well.
[01:10:50] You know it's interesting a lot of people who have not read my book or maybe they have read it
[01:11:06] in the gloss over this but they will wrongly assume that my injuries and that ambush and the
[01:11:18] aftermath of that ambush were the hardest thing I've ever been through. And I tell them absolutely
[01:11:25] not. By far that moment right there and that period of time in my life about a,
[01:11:32] that was about a four month period, maybe five months that journey to the bottom.
[01:11:38] And I was almost at rock bottom at that point and this is where the psychology of humans is an
[01:11:50] interesting thing because all of us have that little voice that lives inside of us. I call mine
[01:11:58] my demon and my demon has been my greatest pusher because he tells me what I can't do and he also at
[01:12:08] times can be the most dangerous thing out there because they will push you to do things or wrong,
[01:12:14] they will push you to do things and tell you you can't do things. And it was in that moment that I
[01:12:19] literally was listening to that that you know you will never recover. You know your career is over.
[01:12:26] There's no way you're going to come back from this. The guys are never going to follow you again.
[01:12:32] All these lies. These are lies that we tell ourselves and I think it's really important you know
[01:12:37] if there's anything about me. I tell people that I am an expert on overcoming adversity failure
[01:12:44] and crisis and it doesn't matter how bad things have been you always can recover and goes back
[01:12:50] to those three rules of leadership. You just once again go back to leading yourself and in
[01:12:56] that moment though I was so crushed, so crushed because I had convinced myself that I had done the right
[01:13:06] thing and unfortunately I still believe that and I just saw myself as a victim who had no way
[01:13:12] that I could recover and you know it's sad and you know you know that God moment that I glance
[01:13:19] to over because I don't think if I had made them a stake or wherever I was I'm not having pictures
[01:13:24] of my wife and kids right there I probably wouldn't have done it because I just felt so hopeless
[01:13:30] and then I was ashamed honestly for thinking that and thinking about the impact I would even
[01:13:36] them. So I'd love to say that was the catalyst of starting to climb out of that hole but I
[01:13:42] actually continued to spiral down over the next couple of months until finally you know my you know
[01:13:49] that moment occurred right after you know my judgment had been set upon me which really I was
[01:13:56] very fortunate because I should have been grateful because really what they could have done is said
[01:14:01] you're out of here you know we're sending you out of the teams you're going to go before
[01:14:04] try to review board and they didn't you know the CEO believed in me he said you know you've done
[01:14:09] a lot of great things you've had some amazing moments you've just you've got some flaws you've got some
[01:14:14] arrogant flaws and you definitely we need to work on your decision making
[01:14:23] leadership abilities so that's what they did it's it's you know when I was reading this part
[01:14:33] it's it's it's I don't I don't think you could have I don't think a human being I don't think you
[01:14:38] could explain I don't think will Shakespeare could explain to someone that's not in the teams
[01:14:46] what it feels like to be in the teams and to feel like maybe that's not going to be your life anymore
[01:14:54] that's rough man and I don't think I mean you did your best and like I said I don't think it's just
[01:15:00] too to explain and I mean I guess you do it because you explain listen you were at a point where
[01:15:05] if you couldn't be in the teams you didn't want to be alive that's where you were at right there
[01:15:12] and I guess that does explain it I think it might be hard for people to relate to but like for people
[01:15:18] like you and me that grew up literally whole adult life in the sealed teams I can't even imagine
[01:15:26] if at the in the in the in the in the highlight of that moment of being deployed in combat you just
[01:15:33] lost your your comrades and arms from your task unit and to be told okay you can't do this job anymore
[01:15:41] I mean like you said and again I think it's going to be hard for people to understand
[01:15:46] that it seems like you you would never want to you wouldn't want to live at all and then just
[01:15:51] to add this on to what you're saying and I say this every time that I talk about these kind of personal
[01:15:57] storms that people get into and I've just got to say this in case someone hasn't heard me say it before
[01:16:06] when you're in that storm it seems like it's goes forever in every direction anyone on the outside
[01:16:13] would anyone ten feet away from you would look at you and say oh yeah you you made some mistakes
[01:16:17] you need to you need to get back on the horse you need to get back out there here's what's going
[01:16:20] to help you get fixed here's what gets you back on but when we're it we every direction you look
[01:16:25] is black and you think you're not getting out and team guys don't play around either at all going
[01:16:31] back to the book so you decide okay I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna stick it out you're on your way back
[01:16:37] I've made my way my way back to my hooch when I entered our living quarters I walked by our
[01:16:42] message board and saw notes crawled next to my name why don't you go ahead and kill yourself
[01:16:48] I stared at the words for I don't know how long the hallway was empty nobody had been standing
[01:16:54] around waiting to see my reaction that's team guys there's no mercy in a seal too there's not you
[01:17:03] know I've often thought about that and you know the deal we have incredibly dark humor so I
[01:17:09] often wonder what somebody just tried to lighten the mood and kind of shock me into hey dude come
[01:17:17] out of it you know go fix yourself I've always I've often wondered that or were they serious and
[01:17:23] just like dude you're a disgrace yeah we don't and and I know for a fact I mean there was a point
[01:17:28] right before we left on that deployment a couple weeks later where you know guys were being
[01:17:34] divvyed up and where they were going next so next well tune next leadership and they were asked you know
[01:17:39] who who do you want to work with you know who do you want to work under and and they unacquipically
[01:17:47] wrote we don't want to work with red so this was an additional blow that really kind of reinforced
[01:17:52] team and you you you you got some you got some work to do except I'll be honest I wasn't at that point
[01:18:00] yet you weren't there yeah I was still at rock bottom you know you talk about the storms
[01:18:03] I talk about life ambushes and this was a major life ambush one of the first major life
[01:18:10] ambushes I'd ever encountered and I literally was on the axe taking withering fire and I couldn't
[01:18:19] figure out how to get out of it and you were doing your best to return fire with your pistol yes
[01:18:24] and in this case I was going to return one round thinking that was going to fix things I'm going
[01:18:29] to I'm going to I'm right yeah I'm going to maintain this position right here and I'm going to win
[01:18:34] no actually you're not you need to you need to look around you need to maneuver so you do end up
[01:18:41] keeping your tried it because obviously there were some guys that that believed like you said
[01:18:46] believed in you and saw that you had the potential and actually sometimes people ask me what makes
[01:18:53] a guy get fired or not get fired and for me it's like almost 100% if the guy
[01:19:00] lacks humility they're going to get fired or if they if they if no one if I would see a guy that
[01:19:05] had no humility whatsoever and I didn't see a crack it'd be like okay this guy's a lost cause
[01:19:10] he's never going to listen to anyone you can't coach someone that lacks humility completely
[01:19:14] so or you can't help though they think they're going to sit on the axe and just get shot up
[01:19:19] that's the way it's going to be so somebody saw that hey we can get through to this guy you know he's a
[01:19:24] good team guy and more importantly to that point and this is a great leadership point and
[01:19:28] organizational point not only are they going to sit there and take those hits because they're
[01:19:33] too arrogant to be willing to move they're going to pull everybody else down with them and that's
[01:19:38] where it gets really dangerous I mean especially in our community where lives are on the line
[01:19:42] yeah I mean if they're unwilling to learn or humble themselves enough they're going to get somebody
[01:19:47] else killed and that was the big concern at that point and man I've got to give Kudos to my
[01:19:52] commanding officer who is a friend of this day he saved my career because I wasn't exhibiting humility
[01:19:58] you know I was fighting back I was I did the right thing I'm the victim here you know I'm just
[01:20:03] being thrown under the bus and thankfully he had enough faith in me I guess he had seen enough good
[01:20:10] that he said I think we can fix him yeah good man and one of the things that they do to fix you
[01:20:17] in the seal teams is send you to range your school I want to full vacation and I would say
[01:20:24] there's a small there's some people that go to range your school because they want to go to
[01:20:28] range your school right on but oftentimes in the seal teams range your school and I wouldn't even
[01:20:33] call it punishment but it's it's like a reeducation and that's definitely something that has always
[01:20:42] been and that's what they do with you okay they're going to they're going to send you to a really
[01:20:46] tough training school where it's not just a tough training school where you get weeded out you learn
[01:20:50] some tactics you learn to you learn leadership and I did not go to range your school but you know
[01:20:56] it's a great school everyone I know that the range is that I know are awesome guys so great school
[01:21:00] but oftentimes we use it in the seal teams maybe punishment is the wrong word in some cases I know
[01:21:07] it's been punishment occasionally a guy I want to go there but generally guys I mean generally
[01:21:13] guys are working so I'm not going to go to range your school you end up getting the range of
[01:21:18] school and here we go sick hungry burning with resentment because as you said you're not at this point
[01:21:23] you're still like oh this is this this is crap I don't deserve this yeah I was to say I was better
[01:21:31] is it understatement yeah burning with resentment I went into the first few days without my
[01:21:38] heart or mind engaged the first week of Ranger School is nothing but a gut check long days with
[01:21:42] minimal sleep exposure the elements in constant physical and mental evolutions to get those who
[01:21:46] don't want to be there to quit teamwork leadership within a circle of peers and decision making
[01:21:52] under stressful conditions where the objective of this first phase as a seal I should have
[01:21:55] represented my community in the best possible manner while by displaying leadership a commitment
[01:22:00] to teamwork and a willingness to overcome obstacles instead my actions showed me to be arrogant
[01:22:05] ill tempered and unwilling to work with others many soldiers falsely believe that seals are like
[01:22:09] that and my actions re-simply reinforced it I failed to represent my community as anything but
[01:22:16] that stereotype so you have this bad attitude you go out on a compass course you're pretty good at
[01:22:22] land nav you think you're gonna kick ass you don't kick ass you do a bad job the black
[01:22:28] hat to the Ranger instructors here we go the black hat's chuckled with laughter damn squid got lost
[01:22:34] we should have given you a boat swabby another growl not surprising seals know how to
[01:22:38] navigate anyways I failed at something I once took great pride in not so good without your Gucci
[01:22:44] gear are you another sneered I lost it all my pent up fury frothed out of me screw this course
[01:22:50] and screw you kiss my ass I walked up to my company instructor and told them I'm out of here I
[01:22:55] quit are you sure you want to do that without thinking I said yes I was reading this book and I was like
[01:23:08] day I was thinking damn I mean holy shit yeah talk about a total breakdown of emotional
[01:23:17] leadership I mean that's your reality I had died and and here's the problem with that I had
[01:23:23] allowed this to happen by not managing myself I had allowed this I was like a pressure cooker
[01:23:32] waiting to pop off and instead of managing it and recognizing it come to grips with it I didn't
[01:23:39] and it it just manifested itself in that moment where I failed the land nav course because of my own
[01:23:48] arrogance and then you know I allowed those Ranger instructors to get under my skin in that
[01:23:52] failure instead of immediately saying well hey no big deal I could have gone back and done it again
[01:23:56] like three days later because there I wasn't the only guy that failed there were other guys that failed
[01:24:01] but instead of that I instantly just it was one additional blow that I had sustained and being at
[01:24:10] this tipping point you know I allowed them to get under my skin and snapped and it is the only
[01:24:15] thing I have ever quit in my life that I have verbally quit I mean for all intense and purposes I
[01:24:20] rang the bell in that moment and so angry and frustrated and listened to that demon that said your
[01:24:27] career is over you will never recover from this you know this is the final straw you know you had
[01:24:33] an opportunity and you missed it man so you know nobody's ever going to follow you again and everyone
[01:24:39] screwed you over and put you in this point absolutely that's why you know victim victim mentality
[01:24:46] now this is a miracle this is a miracle this is a big it's god moment that and I people don't
[01:24:53] understand this this is a miracle the kernel in charge of Ranger School happens to be friends with
[01:25:01] Vince Peterson who we talked about earlier and that's not his real name but he's a legendary
[01:25:07] seal officer and a prior Vietnam Marine battle away city by the way just a just an awesome guy
[01:25:17] and for whatever reason miracle the kernel that's in charge of Ranger School is friends with
[01:25:28] with Captain Peterson and here we go go in back to the book you're sitting there talking to the
[01:25:33] kernel Vince Peterson was the greatest natural leader I'd ever known he had a knack of expressing
[01:25:39] where the team needed to go with just a few words he'd plant seeds like his men taking ownership of the
[01:25:44] plan then watched as everything went forward with the plan when the plan succeeded and it almost
[01:25:51] always did he never took the credit he gave it to everyone else in retrospect I'm not proud that all
[01:25:57] I could manage was the fable and this goes back to something you talked about earlier in the book
[01:26:02] but at this point I was still unable to face the truth myself let alone admit it to the leader I
[01:26:07] respected above all others and so here you go your conversation with Captain Vince Peterson red
[01:26:16] do you really think Ranger School is punishment it is sir red have you ever thought that maybe
[01:26:23] there is an opportunity here sir you have a chance to learn something of value if you're willing to
[01:26:30] take it I didn't know what to say to that I'd not been trying to learn anything since I've
[01:26:35] Afghanistan I'd been trying to defend and justify you're getting ready to throw your career away red
[01:26:42] I'm not sure I have a career left sir red he said firmly what are you going to do if you get out
[01:26:49] if you come back you'll be out of the navy in a month how are you going to support your family
[01:26:54] he let that sink in I had no answer in state silent besides do you really want to go through your
[01:27:01] life having ended your career this way you can recover you control your destiny and your future
[01:27:08] you can earn back the respect of the guys if you give them something to respect if your actions demand
[01:27:14] respect I hadn't looked at it my situation from that angle red get back in that course finish it
[01:27:23] then come back with your head held high and show that you have the ability to lead that'll leave a mark
[01:27:35] yeah well and you know for people to understand I I didn't sleep a wink that night after I
[01:27:42] after I quit and I was so ashamed of what I had done and I was so convinced that there was no way I could
[01:27:50] undo it that I literally was just resigned to the fact that my career was over and when I went into that
[01:28:00] office I first spoke to the sergeant major in the sergeant major asked if I wanted to speak to anybody
[01:28:05] in the field team I don't know man I don't want to talk to anybody you know I am the failure I am
[01:28:11] broken and and then it was the kernel who asked me and I said the same thing so the mere fact
[01:28:17] and this is he didn't even offer he just started dialing so the and the mere fact he talked about
[01:28:24] this bait moment that that Vince Petersen happened to be at his phone and answered right then
[01:28:32] and and saying be on the phone and him to hand it to me and there was no way in hell I mean I had
[01:28:37] such respect for this this man there was no way I could say no and you know that conversation you
[01:28:45] know this is this is the highest levels of leadership to be able to quickly analyze the situation
[01:28:51] especially when you're working with people to understand you know okay this is where we're at
[01:28:55] this is the battlefield I'm looking at this is what I have to work with and this is what I need to
[01:29:00] do to move this person to where we're going to motivate and inspire them and I mean he did it flawlessly
[01:29:05] he'll exactly what to tell me he he told me both the good and the bad he gave me hope
[01:29:10] and he told me what happens if you don't which would be hopeless you know I will have you out of the
[01:29:15] military in less than a month and then you know I tell people that is the most succinct and powerful
[01:29:20] leadership advice I've ever been given you know people will follow you if you give them a reason to
[01:29:24] if you give them something to respect and that really is the foundation of you know the three
[01:29:30] rules of leadership I talk about lead yourself that's 80% of it you know leading others comes naturally and he was
[01:29:37] right because I left that office and the the funny thing about it though is I got off the phone
[01:29:44] and I asked the Colonel I said serve which put me back in class and he didn't miss a beat no
[01:29:55] he said instead you will go to the holding company and we will class you up with a new class a month later
[01:30:02] which is just what you needed you get rolled back for 30 days going back to the book I
[01:30:08] bent down and picked up the cigarette butt lying in the grass at my feet with a flick the butt
[01:30:14] spun into the garbage bag I'd been dragging across post with me so here you are a combat seal
[01:30:19] officer picking up cigarette butts 13 years and 13 years in as I filled my bag with litter the
[01:30:26] bit bitterness flared again I put 13 and I put in 13 and a half years I was a member of one of the
[01:30:31] most elite special operations units in modern history millions of dollars were spent preparing me
[01:30:36] training me out fitting me to handle the toughest battlefield tasks our nation can face and my
[01:30:41] own brothers have reduced me to this I stopped and thought about that statement where was the personal
[01:30:49] responsibility in it Vince Petersen's word came back to me you have an opportunity to learn here
[01:30:57] if you're willing to take it I served with good men whom I respected they turned their back on me
[01:31:06] or did they what did all this say about me a door suddenly opened in my mind the place it led to
[01:31:15] was a dark room that I had never entered inside I could see the truth about myself through the
[01:31:22] facade of lies I had built I stood at its threshold not really wanting to walk through
[01:31:30] Sunsu once said if you know your enemies and you know yourself you'll never be defeated
[01:31:36] I didn't know myself I was running blindly through life refusing to even acknowledge my weaknesses
[01:31:44] I have been an arrogant ass most of my career clearly I needed to come down to earth
[01:31:50] maybe trash detail did serve a purpose after all I guess I needed to mentally flatline before I
[01:31:59] could reconstruct myself for leadership I found another cigarette button flickered into my back the
[01:32:07] bitterness over being forced into this sort of work evaporated far from a humiliating burden it was
[01:32:14] giving me clarity I surely needed for years my attitude at hobbled relationships and endangered my
[01:32:20] career I suddenly recalled a moment years before I'd worked my tail off for months on a special
[01:32:26] project when I finished it I knew I was going to receive a significant award for the effort
[01:32:30] for whatever reason it got downgraded to a lesser award what did you do after you found out I
[01:32:36] thrown a temper tantrum I went off on one of our admin guys who had congratulated me after I
[01:32:42] received it instead of being grateful receiving any sort of acknowledgement I'd thrown the
[01:32:47] award at him I might as well have thrown it in the face of Captain Peterson who was my CEO at the time
[01:32:53] that incident stuck with my peers who witnessed it and for years after when I ran into one of them
[01:32:59] they'd remind me of it Jason Redmond Navy Achievement Medal Throar Vanguard of Leadership
[01:33:07] I can't say I looked forward to picking up trash the next morning but I didn't start the
[01:33:12] day despising what would come next I was ashamed that I'd fought so highly of myself that I saw
[01:33:18] myself as above picking up trash I realized that as a seal leader it was my responsibility to accept
[01:33:24] the example with everything I undertook there you go there you go it was you know so this is
[01:33:38] probably the point and I talked to a lot of people about this like I wish I could say that after I
[01:33:44] hung up the phone with Captain Peterson that I went back and was like you know yeah let's go let's
[01:33:52] do this you know let's crush this and instead I still was kind of finished I was on that slope
[01:33:59] down to crash that plane and I finally crashed that plane and hit really the bottom of the barrel
[01:34:07] and it was at that point that I really started to analyze myself and this something I talked to a
[01:34:11] lot of people about you know you truly have to know yourself you cannot because our weaknesses
[01:34:16] manifested themselves in the hardest times they don't come out in the good times and the good times
[01:34:22] there's no issues with it and the only way you could manage that you know it's to a mental leadership
[01:34:27] and emotional leadership at the highest level because in the hardest times and usually those
[01:34:32] in the times you've got to be managing the most is when it comes up and it was by really starting to
[01:34:38] rip myself apart and look at you know all these things that I had done and understanding
[01:34:44] oh yeah when I get into these situations I feel that you know that melt down with the
[01:34:49] Ranger instructors you know I felt that coming on I could have stopped it but I didn't I let it go
[01:34:55] you know they let the fuse and instead of tamping it you know out I let it burn and blow up
[01:35:02] so it was you know really it was these moments and this is probably the biggest thing that I can
[01:35:07] tell anybody out there it is never too late you can always come back so for for months I had convinced
[01:35:16] myself that I was a victim for months I had convinced myself there was no way to do this and for the
[01:35:21] first time when I finally looked at you know these are your weaknesses but all by the way man you
[01:35:26] got some amazing strengths and you know you need to figure out how to amplify these strengths minimize
[01:35:32] these weaknesses and and what an opportunity you have you are a seal that's in Ranger School that
[01:35:38] could crush this course set the example and come back every day is another opportunity you're going
[01:35:45] to screw up again and that's okay but you know so for the first time I saw hope standing at the
[01:35:51] front block bottom and looking up through this tunnel I saw a glimmer of light well what's what's
[01:35:58] when when you say that what I think about is what people get themselves into they box themselves
[01:36:07] into this scenario and it's exactly where you had boxed yourself into which was hey look this guy
[01:36:14] doesn't like me this guy's blaming me for that this these people have a bad attitude and you're
[01:36:20] and guess what other people you can't control and so you end up in a hopeless situation because I
[01:36:26] can't change this guy's attitude he's an asshole he doesn't like me he whatever we had to run in
[01:36:30] this person they don't trust me and I can't change that and so when you're in a situation where
[01:36:36] you can't change the situation at all because you don't have control over any of it well then guess what
[01:36:42] you're hopeless but the minute you look at yourself and you say wait a second I actually control
[01:36:50] everything that's going on right now everything people's perception of me is based on my behavior
[01:36:58] not theirs and that's what that's what I like to what Peter said you you control your destiny
[01:37:06] in your future that's that to me I highlighted that 98 times you control your destiny in your future
[01:37:14] and at this point in the book is where you saw and it took you picking up cigarette butts
[01:37:20] and it took you to that point where you say wait a second all these things that have happened to me
[01:37:25] I can get control of them and I can turn them in a better direction and yeah
[01:37:31] that's awesome and the journey began yeah that you kind of expanded a little bit more here
[01:37:41] I could not I could not change my decision but I should you're talking about this is when you're talking
[01:37:46] about you're reflecting now on what happened on your decision to go into the valley and Afghanistan
[01:37:51] that whole scenario that you got trouble for here's what you said about it I could not change my
[01:37:56] decision but I should have owned it in its aftermath I should have listened to those with more
[01:38:02] experience taking my lumps and moved forward that is how leaders grow I was so desperate to justify
[01:38:09] and defend my actions I lost sight of what to do of what I was there to do I was there to lead
[01:38:14] when necessary and to follow and call upon but above all else to accomplish the mission as part of
[01:38:18] the team instead in the aftermath I made it all about me and the defense of my ego
[01:38:24] again when you come into the office and say this wasn't my fault I was doing the right thing
[01:38:31] everyone that's looking at you is thinking he's he doesn't even see what he did wrong and that's
[01:38:36] where you talk about in this book you talk about the fact that one of the most
[01:38:41] one of the most horrible things on the battlefield is an arrogant young person that thinks
[01:38:46] there's not going to listen to anyone and you when you sit there and put up your defenses you're
[01:38:51] showing everyone that back to the book yes senior chief carry hated me we load each other but the
[01:38:56] truth he was a damn good operator in a firefight I would have wanted him there as a tactical leader
[01:39:00] in his own abrasive way he attempted to mentor me if I had put down my pride I would have seen it
[01:39:06] and I would have learned a lot from him that never happened I failed to manage our relationship
[01:39:10] and it poisoned the entire cartoon it also hurt my reputation with my teammates myself to see
[01:39:15] finally collapse to carry had not done this to me I done this all to myself I was being punished
[01:39:23] less for the decision I'd made and more for the way I'd fiercely refused to take responsibility for it
[01:39:31] the more I railed against those aligned against me the more I deserved to be punished
[01:39:36] I wasn't betrayed by my teammates I betrayed them with my selfishness it was time to grow up
[01:39:46] damn
[01:39:53] yeah it was exciting because it suddenly rangerschool suddenly became a new opportunity and
[01:39:58] really I set my sights on you know kind of interestingly enough I think all of us are super
[01:40:03] gold ribbon people and for the first time I saw an opportunity and and set a goal you know
[01:40:10] which is what I think all of us do so well at you know we we have a target to move to
[01:40:16] and now I have a path to go after it and that that path became I want to graduate the honor man
[01:40:23] of this course and set it set you know woke up the next morning firing up the guys around me
[01:40:30] and hey man we're getting ready to start up again it's going to be awesome let's go do this
[01:40:35] so yeah again I'm harping on this a little bit but just the fact that this book is so powerful
[01:40:42] because to to walk through that transition I'll tell you anybody that's red extreme ownership
[01:40:49] or anyone that listens to this podcast is going to be especially
[01:40:55] they're they're going to be having even deeper understanding because they they I talk about
[01:40:59] this all the time and to see you go down that path see where it leads and then be able to come
[01:41:05] back out be no comeback out is awesome but but it's so powerful to actually here from your perspective
[01:41:14] from someone that was in that exact position and doing those things to hear you saying it
[01:41:20] and be able to witness the turnaround it's uh it's powerful powerful stuff next morning I hit the
[01:41:27] ground running and never looked back the company I joined was full of strangers no matter I
[01:41:30] did everything full bore made sure I helped but made sure I help everyone in my squad whenever I could
[01:41:35] I was going to be the dis I was not going to be the disconnected selfish jerk I had been this
[01:41:41] go around my heart was fully invested and you kick ass in range of school you're not honor man
[01:41:50] because you find out that yeah I only find out at the very end that uh if you're rolled back
[01:41:55] you're not eligible but I didn't really well I was ranked at the top of my period of
[01:42:00] hours I mean all the instructors gave me about a man your dirge is crushing it and uh so no matter
[01:42:07] yeah it was a goal you know another great guy earned it and well deserved you end up back
[01:42:14] at the back of the teams you go back into a task unit and you're an assistant platoon commander now
[01:42:19] yeah again is this a reroll as a is it a re-reload as an assistant platoon commander or you
[01:42:25] still just super junior because you were a Steven Admiral guy no I had just made jg at this point
[01:42:32] so back then we still you know now they're kind of doing it differently a lot of us uh
[01:42:36] Steven Admiral guys did have the ability to do two pumps yeah they made me do two pumps yeah
[01:42:42] they wanted me to do two pumps and this is I mean for those who are not aware there was a little bit of
[01:42:48] uh impetus on me because they basically so as officers if you ever get a letter
[01:42:56] or a reprimand and you're record it effectively ends your career I mean if it that official letter
[01:43:01] goes into your record you're done you'll remember you won't make the next rank you're going to be
[01:43:04] out and they basically wrote this letter uh my outgoing CEO who was an afghanist and to my
[01:43:10] incoming CEO who was taken over the team and they basically said you made some mistakes and we
[01:43:17] questioned your tactical decision making and leadership abilities but we're going to give you a second
[01:43:22] chance so this letter and I was you know I was in the office with the CEO and he put it into
[01:43:28] his safe and basically said this will be burned or shredded at the end of the deployment
[01:43:35] if you show us you have the ability and if you don't it will go into your current and they had
[01:43:39] my officer record right there and they were like it will go right here into your record so and I
[01:43:45] think they knew the power of that also and it gave me additional momentum and I think this is
[01:43:50] important in leadership you know it's I mean same way we raise our kids there's got to be accountability
[01:43:54] you can't just tell somebody hey this what I want you to go out and do we have to let
[01:43:58] lay out the right and left limits and tell them this is where you're going to go and you have to
[01:44:02] have those things that hold you accountable so I don't know if I necessarily needed that I was
[01:44:07] pre-fired up on wanting to get back and set the example and redeem myself but I will say in the
[01:44:14] back of my mind I knew hey man you you got a you got a crush yeah that's it that's a I don't
[01:44:20] know if that's happens in all the military but in the seal teams there's there's a lot of
[01:44:27] letters that get shredded and part of it is like a cover your ass like when I was a commander
[01:44:34] a part of it's cover your ass because hey look you screwed up and if you screw up again and everyone
[01:44:40] knows that this is happened multiple times and you haven't been counseled about it I look like an idiot
[01:44:44] and not what I look like an idiot I am an idiot if I'm not documented that you screwed something
[01:44:48] up so I'm going to document this and make sure that you know I've got a documented but by the way
[01:44:54] I'm not trying to kill your career if you can turn around and you can get back on the path cool
[01:44:57] this thing's going in the shredder but here it is got to get some ways to go before this thing
[01:45:02] goes in that shredder yeah it's a pretty common thing in the seal teams not too common but um
[01:45:07] so you're in a task unit your assistant between commander and things are going good and you
[01:45:14] you were a lot more self aware and again you have to read the whole book to get all these details
[01:45:20] about that transition you were a lot more self aware and you started off as mobility commander
[01:45:26] and then eventually you started working with the assault team and here we go back to the book
[01:45:32] after that first successful mission on the assault team I had earned a spot in the mix
[01:45:36] and harmonized with the task units battle rhythm, arpotoons, rotated back and forth between
[01:45:40] running mobility or running the assault force the pace was intense and the mission started to blend
[01:45:46] together in a groundhog day sort of way I may have lost my way years ago but through God
[01:45:53] and a willingness to work hard and learn my strengths and weaknesses I had earned my way back
[01:45:58] into the brotherhood and you detail some some good missions some pretty hot missions you know
[01:46:09] you guys got some pretty good gun fights and you're getting towards the end of deployment
[01:46:13] and your TU commander he's he you have a little conversation with him and he says we're going to
[01:46:19] have you run as ground force commander on the next one for a second what this really meant failed
[01:46:25] to register really JP in the date at this point in the book JP is a guy he's your task unit commander
[01:46:32] JP nodded yeah I spoke to Eric and Paul and we all agree you're ready for it besides as
[01:46:36] a help get you up the speed to be a platoon commander at length I finally answered that's awesome
[01:46:42] thanks for the opportunity you earned it bro he turned to leave I had done it my career was back
[01:46:48] on track it last I knew some in our community would always hate me from my mistakes but I had
[01:46:53] earned back the trust of the men I served and fought with since 2004 I'd been an officer within
[01:46:58] our community rank does not automatically make you a leader your character makes you a leader your
[01:47:03] actions make you a leader rank is almost irrelevant after years of self is focused on myself I'd
[01:47:10] finally understood what it meant to lead men of this caliber and what was required of a man in
[01:47:17] order to be part of this most elite of all fraternities the letter in the safe would be destroyed
[01:47:23] for an instant the horizon ahead held no boundaries and again I skipped this was not like an
[01:47:30] easy process man you worked your way right back up you started with small jobs you made some
[01:47:35] mistakes that you you know you you talk about the you late you laced the marine colonel and
[01:47:44] he was not happy yeah not happy so quick story you're doing deep confliction and you can't
[01:47:51] identify and so you escalate the deep confliction to a visible laser and then you know they
[01:47:57] realize that that both sides were friendly and you was a marine core colonel that you were
[01:48:02] lacing and he wasn't too happy about that and when you when when your commander brought you in
[01:48:08] and said hey what that'll happen you took ownership of it and said hey here's the mistakes I made
[01:48:12] instead of blaming everyone else so big big turning point and and I think this is an important point
[01:48:22] you know you you know I mean within our community it's pretty hard to turn around when you've
[01:48:26] made a major mistake like that I mean all of you guys get out we've had guys that have been sent to
[01:48:32] the fleet and some never come back and then some come back and redeem themselves but in a command some
[01:48:38] just get put into a ostracized position of low importance inside the seal teams right and it's like
[01:48:46] oh cool yep we yeah oh yeah you're stationed over there yep we know what you're doing and we know
[01:48:50] all about you and and we get that you still have your tried and and you're still considered a seal but
[01:48:57] you're not a team guy and we all know that yeah you would not be invited to go back to an
[01:49:01] operational billet you know you're relegated to training and all that you know other things so
[01:49:05] I mean it really is for people to understand I mean our community is driven by amazingly talented
[01:49:12] warriors and at the end of the day you know the leader they rely on the guys next to them and their
[01:49:18] leaders to make those good decisions so if you've made bad decisions I mean to be able to come back
[01:49:22] and them say okay you know you've shown us that we can trust you once again to lead and make the right
[01:49:28] decisions so it really I tell people there's a hardest road I've ever walked I mean when I got wounded
[01:49:36] I was like I got this yeah the the trust when broken is extremely hard to rebuild and I get asked
[01:49:46] a lot how do you build trust with people either whether it's been broken or whether you don't know
[01:49:50] them and it's very clear in the book and again this is why people should get the book the way that
[01:49:55] you're asking to commander and I'm trying to think of the alias because I know them to jp the way that
[01:50:01] you're asking to commander is very common to what a guy does he gives you a little bit of
[01:50:04] responsibility and let you let you earn a little bit of trust and then once you've earned a little bit
[01:50:11] of trust gives you a little bit more responsibility once you earned a little bit more trust and that
[01:50:15] continued going this is this is now a six month appointment plus a year long work up or whatever so
[01:50:20] keys been giving you a little bit of trust and you've been earning and earning and earning
[01:50:24] back your trust and you are digging out of a deficit right that's a lot harder so that is a lot harder
[01:50:30] when if you show up as a new guy you're like a zero right because and then you're going to get a
[01:50:34] little trust and then maybe you get to a a point two and then you get a little bit more
[01:50:38] responsibility and you get to a point four you were at like a negative nine and so you had to just
[01:50:44] you don't earn your way back to get to zero and then once you read zero then you had to build up and
[01:50:51] at this point in the book and you did some again I'm sorry I'm not going to go into everything but
[01:50:56] you know you had a pretty dynamic potentially horrible situation unfolding big gunfight going on
[01:51:04] some head counts not accounted for people and you took charge of the situation and that probably
[01:51:09] is what you know jumped you up a bunch of levels in people going okay you know what we can trust this
[01:51:15] guy and and and then you continued these to build that trust and up to the point where and I
[01:51:20] need to explain this because I didn't up to the point where the task unit commander said okay
[01:51:26] one of these next coming missions we're going to make you the ground force commander and what that
[01:51:30] means for civilians is that means you're in charge of everything you're going to go out you're going to be
[01:51:35] the this the main leader the senior leader not even the main they're going to be the senior leader the
[01:51:40] guy in charge of everything that's happening on the battlefield that's what the ground force commander is
[01:51:45] and you're now being it's ended up like you're being told look you've yeah we want you to be
[01:51:50] the ground force commander I want these upcoming operations and that is the ultimate trust for
[01:51:56] someone to give to a subordinate is hey I want you to go out and take my job that I would normally
[01:52:02] do you go do it so pretty amazing come back humbling yeah so you're almost at the end of deployment
[01:52:16] and like an an op comes up we were one week away yeah one week away we were packing up to get ready to go home
[01:52:25] note to self those last operations be careful first and last man the first mission is in the last ones
[01:52:35] getcha you and it's the mission comes down it's one of those missions where you guys are kind of like
[01:52:41] his probably isn't going to go down it's sketchy intel high visibility if it goes and you're thinking
[01:52:46] because we get a lot of those you know this is going to happen and you get used to
[01:52:51] getting all amped up and eventually you don't even get amped up anymore you continue with your daily
[01:52:55] routine go the gym workout whatever and this particular case you guys you you literally went to the gym
[01:53:00] you're working out like normal and I didn't think there was a chance and hell this mission was going to
[01:53:05] happen and some of the guys were looking at it but I just didn't think it was going to happen it was already
[01:53:10] late so we were outside really the window you know to really try and execute and a good manner
[01:53:18] in my opinion and then there were external things you know there's some classified factors to it
[01:53:23] that I don't talk about in the book where which were other some of the really big reasons why
[01:53:27] I did not think there was any chance this was going to happen but but it does and you guys roll
[01:53:35] out on a you know alchita target and definitely you guys had the intel that bad guys expected
[01:53:46] security team expect an enemy security team expected and and again like we would hear that a lot
[01:53:53] I mean it's not like it's not like oh this intel is 100% and you're not going to do anything different
[01:54:00] they tell you there's a security of enemy security team you're like okay check we've heard that
[01:54:05] 27 times they've only been there however many times and so you always always expect it
[01:54:11] that they had there was a little more detailed information about this security detail that
[01:54:16] made it a little bit heavier than some of our regular missions I mean there were things that we knew
[01:54:25] you can't get into the day yeah I can't get into the details of a basic more solid into absolutely
[01:54:30] so it made it a little bit different and kind of raised our hackles a little more than normal
[01:54:34] but you know the process of the mission is the same I mean I know probably you up talked
[01:54:40] other people you know the guys that did the bin Laden raid the mechanics of that mission were the same
[01:54:45] it was just a level you know how we take down a target is pretty much the same regardless of where
[01:54:51] you go and it was the same for this case there were just some things that made us go maybe we should
[01:54:56] prepare a little more you guys roll on the target and the thing is get pretty intense pretty quick once
[01:55:08] you've once you've hit the target you've got it secured now we got some squirgers meaning some
[01:55:12] folks that we think have run away from the target building again I'm not going to go into the full
[01:55:16] detail of the mission which you did a beautiful job of explaining what this was like in the book and that's why
[01:55:21] people get the books they can read it but as we mentioned earlier this ends up in a firefight
[01:55:29] in your in it going back to the book I keyed my radio and called J.P. troops and contact troops
[01:55:34] and contact I have three wounded including me the machine guns were still blazing away at us
[01:55:39] and they walked their barrels right and left Chris crossing our positions with hundreds of 7.62
[01:55:45] millimeter bullets I recognize that if I didn't get a turner kit on what I thought was the
[01:55:50] stump of my left arm I was going to bleed out I looked back at Al and the rest of my team behind
[01:55:55] the tire right then Al Somme gets my feet and trying to run to join them I'll told me this later
[01:56:01] but I have no recollection of standing up after I was hit the first time the P.K.M gunner spotted me
[01:56:06] moving and laid on his trigger according to Al I'd only taken a step or two in my head whip sawed
[01:56:12] forward and my body spun around to the left I fell limp to the ground the team fought I'd been killed
[01:56:22] situation we were in and called in an immediate fire mission the AC 130 crew turned it down the first
[01:56:27] time two times before finally making all acknowledge that if anything happened to us it was Al's fault
[01:56:34] not the gun ships the first 25 millimeter shells hit the thick at behind the enemy
[01:56:38] I lay less than 50 feet from the enemy machine gun that had gaged me I drifted in and out of
[01:56:44] consciousness the entire time awake in a fog of confusion one minute out cold the next
[01:56:51] Al risked his life to save me during a low and fire he rose from behind the tire and charged over to me
[01:56:58] Sean laid down cover fire as Al ran into the teeth of that P.K.M bullets cracked and whitt whined around
[01:57:05] him but he reached me and dragged me back behind the tire where he put a turnic it on my mangled arm
[01:57:10] I remember nothing of this and I didn't know Al had even moved me to the tire until months after the
[01:57:16] fire fight the MetaVac bird arrived a few minutes later and the guys helped us aboard once we were
[01:57:23] airborne and out of harm's way the remainder of the task unit fell back to the original target compound
[01:57:29] to wait for extract but the fight was over the gun shot gun ship detected more movement in the thicket
[01:57:35] enough was enough Al called in 105 millimeter howitzer from the AC 130 in turn the thicket into a smoking
[01:57:41] crater months later when J.P. visited me at home I learned that the Alkai to commander had
[01:57:46] fled the house when he heard our birds coming at the start of the mission he left part of his
[01:57:51] personal security detail behind the fight a battle he had no stomach for himself and they died to the last
[01:57:58] man after inflicting three casualties on us months later another seal team ran the Alkai to
[01:58:04] commander to the ground and killed him justice served so that fire fight and again people should
[01:58:22] read the book to get the details of that fire fight but just reading about you wounded which I've
[01:58:29] covered that part and now you're up and running and get shot in the face and down everything
[01:58:36] guys think you're dead and you know I should have covered this with a little bit more detail but
[01:58:44] you know you're trying to make calls you're trying to let people know what's going on you're trying
[01:58:47] to decipher the situation because it was a rough situation that you guys were in and you end up you know
[01:58:57] get next-directed your boys took care of you they did I owe my life to those guys I mean they
[01:59:05] fought back that gunship overhead you know for special operations squadron I owe my life to those
[01:59:11] guys that was the closest fire mission ever in the Iraq war we were well well they wouldn't
[01:59:17] bring in that mission because we were we were literally within any danger growth close programmer
[01:59:23] there were the machine guns that had me pinned down we're about 45 feet 50 feet away so
[01:59:30] Al did an amazing job I mean this was his third combat deployment you know experience jac experience
[01:59:37] team leader and you know really I mean he hung it all out there exposing himself to get me
[01:59:43] say my life with my turn a kid and the rest of the guys you know fought amazingly to get us
[01:59:49] out of there and get off the axe and survive and yeah I wanted Al to get a navy cross
[01:59:57] they they downgraded it to a silver star to this day you know I'll tell anyone he deserved
[02:00:02] uh navy cross but all those guys did an amazing job I owe my life my life to them and the gunship
[02:00:10] it and obviously you know in the beginning of the book you know the thought that I'd lost my
[02:00:15] arm and what happened is actually I guess my arm was pinned under me so when I reached for it I
[02:00:21] couldn't feel it and you know it just stunned all my nerves there was an earth damage too right yeah yeah
[02:00:27] so when when uh and this is kind of an interesting point that I talked to people about and
[02:00:33] something I'm speaking on all the time now this idea of surviving so having trained in a career
[02:00:39] we we where we learn how to execute ruthless and devastating violence of action in an ambush
[02:00:46] to crush the enemy and destroy the enemy in that kibblesome on the axe and to now be on the
[02:00:53] flip side of that coin and be in a very well executed ambush I mean they had us it was an L-A-A-M-B-O-S
[02:00:59] they had us caught very good crossfire you know and just sheer will for us to fight and at least
[02:01:07] and push back enough that it gave us a window and and by the and sheer we were sheer lock that
[02:01:15] there happened to be that tractor tire back there at least one point of cover because beyond that there
[02:01:20] was nothing but thousands of yards of open Iraqi desert but to be in that ambush in that devastating
[02:01:29] and withering crossfire I stepped out of that ambush into another ambush and the next ambush was
[02:01:37] what I call a life ambush suddenly here I was I'd been on this amazing journey of failure
[02:01:44] growth understanding gaining experience in wisdom and redemption and you know career back on track
[02:01:53] getting ready to screen and go over to the next level seal team was my goal when I came back
[02:02:01] from that deployment I was doing that and suddenly to find myself laying in a hospital bed
[02:02:08] so weak I needed nurses to help me go to the bathroom from the amount of blood loss I had
[02:02:13] the very first thing I woke to was the doctors telling me most likely that we're gonna have to
[02:02:17] empty tape my arm I had no use of my hand I had not seen myself in the mirror my face was totally
[02:02:23] blown apart I had lost my nose cheekbone my eye my bitten the bullet traveled the bullet hit me
[02:02:32] right in front of the ear traveled through my face and exit at the right side of my nose so it took off
[02:02:36] most of my nose took out most of my cheekbone it vaporized my orbital floor so my eye actually
[02:02:44] dropped down into the newfound hole in my face so at damage my eye muscles I broke all the bones
[02:02:50] above my eye it shattered my jaw broke my jaw to my chin so I had not seen myself laying in the
[02:02:58] hospital bed and I'll be honest I was I wasn't ready to look at myself I knew I had tubes coming
[02:03:04] out of everywhere I was tricked I was wired shot at a stomach tube that's how they were feeding me so I
[02:03:09] stepped into this next ambush I was you know with this thought of where do I go from here and
[02:03:20] I'll be honest for the first couple of days I kind of struggled and I think this is natural so
[02:03:24] we talk about this idea being pinned down on the X and how we have to survive in whether it's a real
[02:03:31] world ambush or it's a life ambush for anyone that's out there that's encountered some sort of
[02:03:35] devastating event and I classify life ambushes an event that'll forever leave physical
[02:03:40] mental or emotional scars on you you have to get off the X so I'm laying there in this hospital bed
[02:03:46] and I'm like kicking myself I'm like god man what if I you do the things that humans do when
[02:03:52] bad things happen we start to think well what if I had done this or what if I had done that or
[02:03:57] and you know what if I could go back and change this fact and I did that for probably I don't know
[02:04:05] 36 hours after I got to Bethesda you know just kind of lost in my mind thinking about it and at one
[02:04:10] point I just said stop you can't go back and change the past man what's happens happen the only thing
[02:04:17] you can do is shape the future and I thought back to that journey that I had been on from ground zero
[02:04:24] from that broken man in Afghanistan ready to kill myself to where I had come and I said dude
[02:04:32] the only thing you can do from here is shape the future so get off the X and go and I never
[02:04:39] look back from that point and I tell people that you know you have to push yourself into those
[02:04:45] zones and discomfort so that you can handle these hard situations when they come because if you've
[02:04:50] never forge yourself if you've never been put into these areas it discomfort you're going to be
[02:04:55] crushed when they come because you're not going to be ready I was so ready for that moment when it
[02:05:01] came I mean you know took me about 36 hours after I got home to figure it out but still that's
[02:05:05] pretty quick for a devastating injury like that and I never looked back you're your in Bethesda and just
[02:05:13] just to kind of give a little bit of detail around that you got some doctor named female doctor named
[02:05:19] Dr. Malard and here we go back to the book kind of she's about to list your kind of your situation
[02:05:25] that you're in with energetic bluntness she laid out the extent to my wounds the machine gun bullet
[02:05:31] entered just in front of my right ear it shattered my job vaporized my right or burrow floor destroyed
[02:05:36] my cheek and exit through my nose I'd suffered nerve damage as well virtually nothing was left
[02:05:41] to my cheek bone or ocular floor bones on the right side of my face she and her team was amazed
[02:05:46] I didn't suffer greater I damage so that was a blessing my nose was almost completely destroyed and
[02:05:51] we need a full reconstruction they would need to repair my shattered jaw implant a titanium
[02:05:56] plate to replace the ocular floor and would have to repair the damage to the rest of my facial
[02:06:00] bones on the right side I was still under the impression they could fix me right up and get me back
[02:06:06] into the teams not not now I was not so sure and you at this point your jaw's wires shut in your
[02:06:13] tricks so you can't talk so you write out a note how many weeks are we looking at here dock
[02:06:17] weeks she said surprised no Jay we're talking years a few years at least years it didn't even
[02:06:28] sink in at first there will be progressive surgeries each one will need to be fully healed before we
[02:06:33] can move on to the next one she went on to explain that there was no road map for the extent of the
[02:06:38] extent and nature of my wounds my case was highly complex and I would require extensive bone
[02:06:45] and skin grafts in the years ahead after she left I struggled to keep my spirits up
[02:06:52] this was news I did not want to hear yeah you know and this is an interesting fact you know
[02:07:03] I talked to a lot of other team guys about this I think a lot of us we do a really good job in the
[02:07:08] seal teams and you know I'd like to assume other military units do the same we do a really good
[02:07:13] job of preparing guys if they get killed you know page two we make sure they're all taken care of
[02:07:20] I don't think any of us ever give much thought I should if I was severely wounded I think most of us
[02:07:26] think one side of the coin is you know it'll be merely a flesh wound you know and we'll walk away
[02:07:32] and we'll get back and then the other side of the coin is I'll be killed and I was good with either of
[02:07:38] those side you know it's just kind of resigned myself to that fact so it was a whole another thing
[02:07:43] to be severely wounded and be faced with this fact that hey you may be forever disabled
[02:07:52] and it was tough for you and here's you run into this situation going back to the book one afternoon
[02:07:58] two family members came to visit us Erica took the opportunity to step out and grab some lunch for
[02:08:02] herself I talked with them for a bit which left which quickly fatigued me I started drift off before
[02:08:07] I even realized it while I was dosing I heard them whispering to each other I only got fragments of
[02:08:12] the conversation but it was enough they were full of pity for me when Erica returned and my
[02:08:18] relatives departed I wrote down all that had happened recounting it sent me into a fury again I
[02:08:24] tore off the sheet of paper and handed it to her then I thought for a minute and added never again
[02:08:30] never again would someone seal feel sorry for me I fought for my country and I'll fight to regain
[02:08:36] my health so I will ultimately be able to return to our nation's battlefields I was not here
[02:08:41] for sympathy I was here to recover to be a leader to set an example of mental fortitude it would be
[02:08:47] all too easy to give up into despair but I refused there were men and women in this complex who are
[02:08:52] far more badly wounded than I was missing limbs burned suffering brain trauma or eyesight loss
[02:08:58] I would be grateful for what I had determined to succeed in the days ahead and when you use these
[02:09:04] principles I learned over the last two years to guide me forward I wrote a note to all my visitors
[02:09:09] and asked Erica to hang it up on the door and here's what the note said attention to all who
[02:09:15] enter here if you are coming into this room with sorrow or to feel sorry for my wounds go elsewhere
[02:09:23] the wounds I received I got in a job I love doing it for people I love supporting the freedom of
[02:09:30] a country I deeply love I'm incredibly tough and will make a full recovery what is full
[02:09:38] that is the absolute utmost physically my body has the ability to recover then I will push that
[02:09:46] about 20% further through sheer mental tenacity this room you are about to enter is a room of fun
[02:09:54] optimism and intense rapid regrowth if you are not prepared for that go elsewhere from the management
[02:10:08] and awesome I mean in that picture you got sent to me by someone and eventually it got sent to everyone
[02:10:15] by everyone so it was a viral picture of that sign on your door that you eventually put in bigger
[02:10:22] writing to make sure everyone saw it you eventually you do get home and again you know it
[02:10:33] was I when I want to make a really important point about this because that that was really
[02:10:40] a learning point for me or it was a jump point and it comes back to what we talked about earlier
[02:10:48] in the beginning a little bit of the social leadership idea who you surround yourself with and in
[02:10:54] that moment I had individuals to want to express pity and I realized how dangerous that was
[02:10:59] because if I listened too long to people express that it would be easy to accept that to accept
[02:11:05] this victim mentality and I've walked that road before and I was like no way am I going to allow
[02:11:11] that to happen it is a choice and that's what people need to understand you know having a positive
[02:11:16] attitude on how you handle the situations you're in is a choice and the more you accept positivity
[02:11:23] and drive it forward the more you actually start to believe it and it will create momentum and that's
[02:11:29] really what happened with that sign I said I will not allow that to happen again no one will come
[02:11:34] in here and be sad because I refuse I will not allow it and you never know the impact of the decision
[02:11:43] that you're going to make you you never know how even though deep down inside you were like you
[02:11:48] know holy shit how do I get out of this situation but you project that positivity who you can
[02:11:53] bring with you and bring up and how much you can leave an impact of the last of lifetime
[02:11:58] that sign has gone on to help hundreds of thousands of people I've had people write me
[02:12:06] that have had cancer I've had people that have written me that have had major horrific accidents
[02:12:12] I didn't keep the sign I had it framed and it hangs in the wounded ward at Walter Reed
[02:12:18] and the bottom of the sign is like rub clean now and I'm told that all these wounded warriors
[02:12:23] whenever they go to a surgery they go by and they rub it and it just it continues to have this
[02:12:28] impact Secretary Gates wrote about the sign in his book Michelle Obama's book just came out she wrote
[02:12:35] about the sign and what the impact is so one moment of saying I'm not going to allow someone else to
[02:12:44] drive my thinking makes all the difference and I tell so many people that it is a choice it is a choice
[02:12:50] you can choose to be a victim and feel sorry for yourself or you can choose to be a vector and
[02:12:55] drive for it even if you don't believe it in the moment it doesn't matter you know say it
[02:13:01] live it and start driving forward and that belief will catch fire within you and everybody else
[02:13:07] around you know doubt about it man and and the unfortunate opposite that is when you start
[02:13:16] allowing yourself to be negative and you start listening to people that want to be negative and be
[02:13:21] and drag you down you can easily had to head yourself on that direction as well so when you make
[02:13:28] choice and make a decision on which one of those two directions you want to move in up or down
[02:13:35] we recommend you move up move forward yeah absolutely later that spring Eric and I went out to eat
[02:13:43] at a local outback steak house to celebrate the unwiring of my jaw it been almost seven months
[02:13:50] since I've been able to chew food I was still underway and confined to a wheelchair because of
[02:13:55] the grass but we both needed to night out I just you know I when I was reading this book I was like
[02:14:01] eating something whatever you know and it's just one of those things that we all take for granted
[02:14:07] every single day and you know about how that multiple prisoners of war on this podcast and
[02:14:14] you know they're eating a ball of rice once a day or ball of rice twice a day that has chips
[02:14:18] a wood in it for three years for six years and here here you are you know you're not in the
[02:14:25] prisoner of war but something as simple as eating a steak and that really like hit me hard
[02:14:33] because as you know I take steaks very seriously and to think that like for seven months no steak
[02:14:40] and the daily things and and and that always gets me thinking about the daily things that when I
[02:14:45] talk to my friends that have been wounded it's like it's the daily everyday things and as matter
[02:14:52] fact when we had Jim Web on and he was talking about one of his friends that have been wounded
[02:14:58] in Vietnam and he's like that's the daily courage like that guy was courageous in Vietnam but he's
[02:15:05] courageous every single day takes him X amount of time to get up out of bed takes him X amount of time
[02:15:10] to get his prosthetics to take some X amount of time to do normal functions that people can
[02:15:14] normally do easily he's got a struggle with them all he does in every single day without complaining
[02:15:19] daily courage and so just thinking about you in that situation man
[02:15:23] awesome I flew to Chicago almost once a month in preparation for my first surgery with Dr.
[02:15:31] Walton which he'd scheduled for July the airports and their crowds continued to be a torment
[02:15:36] little kids pointed at me and called to their mothers to look at me too people refused to talk to me
[02:15:42] they'd act ashamed or embarrassed or they'd set expressions of pity on their faces internally
[02:15:46] I raged at them are these the people I sacrificed for coming back from a ship of coming back from
[02:15:53] Chicago on one trip I just broke everyone who stared at me I treated with a sudden boo
[02:15:59] by the end of the trip though I realized I needed to do something different or the bitterness would
[02:16:03] eat me alive the game me a thought I came up with an idea I went online and designed a couple
[02:16:08] t-shirts the first one said stop staring I got shot by a machine gun it would have killed you
[02:16:14] I put an American flag on the back and called it wounded wear so
[02:16:18] are you still making wounded wear shirts so when it wears on pause for right now but it will be
[02:16:24] coming back we've got some work we're getting things online in 2019 but yeah a lot of people have
[02:16:32] asked me when it will come back it will be back I assure you yeah so this podcast is eternal so
[02:16:39] most likely when people are listening to this it is live you get it you get your wounded wear t-shirt
[02:16:45] that's right yeah you were talking about that that sign and that sign got so much attention and
[02:16:53] and was so so impactful to so many people you ended up going the overall office you ended up meeting
[02:17:00] president Bush with your family and then you ended up coming back to the White House again and we're
[02:17:07] going back to the book I went to Mike Montsour's metal vowner ceremony in the White House that
[02:17:17] April Mike was a fellow seal who had jumped on a hand grenade thrown onto a rooftop he had
[02:17:26] and saved two of his teammates in a firefighting in Ramadi he shielded his brothers with his own
[02:17:33] body and paid the ultimate price for that devotion it was deeply moving to be there to see Mike's
[02:17:41] family receive his poshmas metal of honor but while I was there I met another seal named Ryan Job
[02:17:49] he'd been part of the team three and had served with legendary sniper Chris Kyle and I rack
[02:17:55] during the 2006 campaign Ryan had been a mark 48 machine gunner for the team and during a firefight
[02:18:02] that spring of bullet head struck his weapon then hit him in the face destroying his right eye
[02:18:08] he survived and reached Bethesda much as I would a year later but nerve damage cost him as vision
[02:18:14] it is left eye the prospect of spending the rest of his life blind had to have been terrifying
[02:18:21] though he never showed it instead he announced that if he had to be blind he would be the best
[02:18:27] damn blind man there was so that's where I met you for the first time obviously uh
[02:18:35] Mikey and Ryan and Chris were all with me and task unit bruiser and you came out for the
[02:18:41] for the metal of honor ceremony for Mikey and I actually remember looking at you guys you know
[02:18:50] looking at you guys talking to each other and I actually thought I had pictures of it but I didn't
[02:18:54] I I thought I had pictures of YouTube talking but I didn't have any pictures but it was it was
[02:19:02] crazy to sit there and look at both you guys that have been you know both in shot unfortunately
[02:19:07] Ryan you know he lost vision and both eyes which obviously could have happened to you very easily
[02:19:13] and thank god you know it didn't um and you guys kind of you know I guess when you have
[02:19:20] getting shot in the head and calm and you guys kind of became bros and uh who continue on here
[02:19:26] Ryan and I bumped into each other on multiple occasions over the next several months
[02:19:29] on one of the occasions Ryan had come out to the East Coast seal teams for a wounded warrior
[02:19:34] uh benevolent organization conference as we made small talk and met different people I Ryan
[02:19:41] and another seal who had been shot in the eye were joking around and came up with the idea for a club
[02:19:46] for seals who had been shot in the head it was a very small club we decided to call the club
[02:19:52] shit seals hit in the head we unanimously voted on our motto this club sucks
[02:20:06] so yeah just just pretty awesome and that's pretty much you know that's definitely Ryan
[02:20:14] uh Backel's Job's attitude was he was just gonna have an awesome time all the time regardless
[02:20:21] what situation he was in he was gonna he was gonna he was gonna get after it and um yeah what's
[02:20:28] called to you guys meet yeah Ryan was awesome and you know he was ahead uh it was interesting because
[02:20:33] the reconstruction process that they were doing with me was the same they were doing with Ryan
[02:20:38] and obviously I was blessed to keep my vision although there were fixing things with this right
[02:20:43] eye so often I'd call him and I'd be like hey you know you had this done how to go you know
[02:20:50] what did you do do you have any recommendations like anything you know you go to the people
[02:20:54] who have experience so Ryan and I got close through that yeah just kind of learning from him
[02:21:00] well one of the this this was another bit of a of a surprise to me again this is the kind of thing
[02:21:05] that I never had to think about but here you go go back to book in the months that followed
[02:21:11] I knew that I was in for the long game the slog through surgeries and setbacks continue and again
[02:21:15] you got to read this book to realize the absolute just medical uh medical trauma that you're going
[02:21:25] through day in day out and this really drove it home to me I called it medical bud there you go
[02:21:30] it's really what it was medical buds and here's here's one thing that just hit me like a ton of
[02:21:36] bricks by the summer of 2009 I was starting to run low on the available patches of skin for
[02:21:42] grafting my body was rope with scars from surgical sites and over a dozen graphs that to me
[02:21:50] I'm thinking myself I mean you're running out of skin to graft to do to do damage repair to your face
[02:21:58] what is that process like so a lot of times they harvest the skin from you know your thighs and
[02:22:07] areas and and it wasn't that I was just running out of skin they were running on the skin because I've
[02:22:12] got quite a few tattoos so my back is totally tattooed you know you know top my arms so that's what
[02:22:19] the problem was becoming putting tattooed skin on other parts of your body is no big deal they
[02:22:24] could have cut that in a second but obviously they were like you know we did I did not want to
[02:22:29] put tattooed skin on my face so that's where we were starting to run into issues and this really
[02:22:37] is something that a lot of people don't understand with with battlefield injuries is their super
[02:22:42] dirty bombs are dirty bullets are dirty and you fall in the soil and you bleed into the soil
[02:22:50] overseas and that's dirty so the vast majority of wound warriors come home especially from this war
[02:22:58] with infection problems and there's so many guys myself included that it's not your initial
[02:23:04] injuries that are as devastating I mean obviously there's levels of devastation but for so many of
[02:23:09] us it's the infection problems so many guys come back with their limbs and end up losing their limbs
[02:23:14] because of the infection I had major infection problems which caused us to continue have to do more
[02:23:20] more graphs they would have to cut out what they had done because it was infected and failed
[02:23:26] they rebuilt my nose three times so the first two they had to totally cut out and start over so
[02:23:32] that's why we were starting to run into issues hey where do we you know where do we get more
[02:23:36] cartilage where do we get more skin they can use cadaver but it does not it does not last it doesn't
[02:23:43] always take so they always want to use your own body and that's where we started to run into issues
[02:23:56] September 24th 2009 Ryan Job is dead I hadn't known Ryan incredibly well I wouldn't
[02:24:07] call him a close friend we talked on the phone occasionally we shared a common experience and discussed
[02:24:12] our notes on recovery and we shared a twisted sense of humor but above all I respected his spirit
[02:24:19] and relentless energy recapture all he could out of life he made the most of every moment and achieved
[02:24:27] things most people with their eyesight intact never would in 2008 he climbed Mount Rainier
[02:24:35] when I heard about that I was blown away in the climbing community the 14,000 foot volcanic mountain
[02:24:40] in Washington state is considered one of the most difficult to summit in all North America it has
[02:24:45] deadly crevices, narrow ledges and glacial ice it is as technical climb as you can find
[02:24:52] Mount Rainier claims on average three lives a year of those who aspire to summit
[02:24:57] and Ryan made it to the top two years after that bullet robbed him of his vision
[02:25:03] he and Kelly who he had married he and Kelly were getting ready to have a daughter together
[02:25:08] Ryan had started a new life found a fresh path to blaze and had built something from the ruins
[02:25:16] he really was being the best damn blind man out there then with the snap of cosmic fingers
[02:25:24] it was all stolen from him and if you don't know the story there was he went through one of his
[02:25:33] many surgeries because he was still going through surgeries and after the surgeries there was complications
[02:25:41] and he died as well they killed him I mean they messed up yeah there was no overdose
[02:25:55] time that was a total mistake and that slayed me Ryan's death rocked me because I know how hard
[02:26:09] it is to stay positive and to drive forward despite these really hard injuries and it just
[02:26:17] it killed me to know that you know it was a medical mistake that killed him you know I mean it's hard
[02:26:26] enough to go through all this and you survive battle and you know all these things so that that
[02:26:35] that really shook me when Ryan had died and you're still looking at unknown numbers of
[02:26:42] surgeries ahead and at the time yeah I was halfway through so this was 2009 I ended up having surgeries
[02:26:49] all the way up until 2011 yeah and the other thing that was crazy about Ryan was I'm not going to say
[02:26:57] he was out of the woods I mean but he was pretty damn far out of the woods and that's why you know
[02:27:05] to lose him like that was just a fucking nightmare yeah you at this point you still want to get back
[02:27:23] to the teams and you're trying to get your arm fixed to the point where you can have enough
[02:27:32] mobility in it to to change magazines to operate your weapon so you're going to a bunch of
[02:27:40] different people trying to see who is who can make this happen you finally find a guy that's you know
[02:27:47] you think you have a good lead on somebody that can make this happen and he you go to see him
[02:27:53] and he says going back to the book jam gonna be frank with you if you were my son I wouldn't let
[02:27:57] you do this what you have now is the best possible outcome if you proceed and have another surgery
[02:28:02] you'll probably lose some of the range of motion you have now worse you'll set yourself up for
[02:28:08] a lifetime of chronic pain the drive home was a quiet one for me as I deliberated whether or not
[02:28:18] to roll the dice one last time by the time I turned off the freeway and for Virginia Beach I knew it
[02:28:24] was not worth the risk my days as an operator were over part of me always suspected this might happen
[02:28:32] this might happen now it was confirmed I had no epiphanys during the drive home about what to do
[02:28:39] now as the that dream to kick doors again slipped away what would I do how would I support my family
[02:28:46] I didn't have any answers but I knew one thing I'd live as Ryan Joe Pat honor his memory
[02:28:56] and never take another day for granted
[02:28:59] Ryan's death reminded me that nothing is guaranteed in life it can be taken away in a heartbeat
[02:29:19] the life you've built with everything you've got can come apart and instant from circumstances
[02:29:25] far beyond your control you either adapt and overcome or you become a casualty of those twists of fate
[02:29:35] I refused to be a casualty
[02:29:44] so you get this news that hey you're not we can't do this this is what you got what you got
[02:29:53] swear you're at and the idea of getting back the operational again is gone and it's funny
[02:30:03] you know we're just talking about you know you were over talking to some students at Buds and
[02:30:08] yet a guy that was was but what a bit injured older guy you said it wasn't real to come back
[02:30:15] yeah it's medically dropped medically dropped not gonna be able to come back and so dream is gone
[02:30:20] and it's interesting you're talking to him and you've been through it and you're attitude was okay
[02:30:30] let me do now and and like I told him I mean so you know this this idea of life ambushes
[02:30:40] I told him I said you just stepped into one and there there are small ones and big ones
[02:30:45] um a lot of times they're totally unexpected but the reality is most ambushes aren't totally unexpected
[02:30:54] they're indicators that we see before we ever get into it whether we're aware of seeing them or not
[02:30:59] sometimes it's after the fact that we look back nine eleven's a good example of there were
[02:31:03] indicators that we missed before nine eleven happened for us as seals when we move into areas
[02:31:10] we know that's a bad area we are in an area where we're getting channealyzed there's high ground above us this
[02:31:16] would be a good area to execute an ambush you know for me I had seen those indicators coming
[02:31:24] so I kind of knew what was coming I had met so many doctors who said
[02:31:30] literally the doctor from Johns Hopkins who put my arm back together
[02:31:33] they actually wrote a medical journal about what he did with my elbow I mean he successfully reconstructed
[02:31:41] an elbow that had been totally destroyed and it was always funny to me there's an arrogance and I
[02:31:47] think there has to be there has to be a little bit level of arrogance and confidence and high level
[02:31:51] orthopedic certainty so every time I go meet one of these guys they'd be like oh yeah I can fix your
[02:31:56] arm and then they slapped that x-ray up and I'd watch it was like the air got sucked out of the
[02:32:03] room as they looked at it and then they would look at me and they'd say yeah man I'm sorry I
[02:32:08] they're like I don't even know how your arms work and the way it is so when I met the guy from Duke
[02:32:14] who was one of the premier you know hand and arm guys literally the guy that put my arm together was
[02:32:20] probably the premier hand and arm going I tried to get him to go back and do more and he said no
[02:32:26] he said there's no way in hell he said your arm he said going into your arm and getting what we
[02:32:32] got is a miracle he's like I am not going back in and I recommend it again stany but he
[02:32:37] all's doing it well I still try to find other doctors and it was this guy from Duke who finally
[02:32:43] convinced me so when that moment came I kind of knew so as opposed to this young man from buds it
[02:32:51] was less unexpected than what I stepped you know for me it was less unexpected so it just became where do I
[02:33:00] go from here and and interestingly enough I'd laid out some different things for myself one I wanted
[02:33:08] to do a 20 year career so that kind of became my first thing can I still stay in and finish my career
[02:33:13] maybe I can't be operational at this point I was at DMNAC and I think I was at 18 years at this point
[02:33:22] so to been four years almost four years from my injury and so over a couple of days I talked to
[02:33:30] I was working in operations and I just said hey what are our options what can we do and they
[02:33:36] actually allowed me to go work some new things different projects and different things so
[02:33:43] it was great they allowed me to finish what I set out to do but it also gave me a decent amount of
[02:33:49] time at this point it was another year before we started the medical retirement process which
[02:33:54] actually took two years so it carried me to 21 years and it gave me a lot of time to really look at
[02:34:00] you know where does my future go from here and kind of lay out what are my new passions what is
[02:34:05] my purpose and where do I go from this life after the military what can I do with all these lessons
[02:34:10] that I've learned and you know how do I pay it forward how do I honor Ryan how do I honor all these
[02:34:16] guys that every day I walk by this granite wall and they didn't get a choice they didn't get a
[02:34:21] choice to come home so thankfully you know I had that time it's still within the community but
[02:34:29] also coming to grips with the fact that you know like I talked to those young men about
[02:34:35] so many people are so strongly tied to what they do for a living that they cannot function
[02:34:41] if suddenly it's taken away from them there's a lot of a lot of me to a lot of police officers
[02:34:46] and firefighters or professional athletes that if suddenly their career is over they don't know
[02:34:52] how to function without that they've they've tied their identity so much around what they've done
[02:34:59] and I realized that the lessons that I learned in the the the seal teams and this journey that I
[02:35:06] been on was incredibly relatable and it was had nothing to do with tactical lessons you know I
[02:35:11] didn't need to be the guy that got out and taught you how to shoot or do anything and that like that
[02:35:16] what I realized is there were amazing life lessons the lessons human lessons lessons in leadership
[02:35:23] and teamwork and overcoming adversity in this idea of helping people you know not only survive but
[02:35:30] thrive from crisis and ambushes so that really started to become the path that I was walking
[02:35:36] and to help other wounded warriors well I just want to wrap this last little section of the book
[02:35:45] because we're talking about the identity and what you invested your life into and
[02:35:52] you say this I held the trident in my hand this golden emblem had driven my life I focused on it
[02:35:59] I coveted it I became enamored by it I almost lost it and then I earned it back
[02:36:06] before I sacrificed my body for it only then did I finally understand what it truly represented
[02:36:14] it carried the spirit of warrior poets like Mike Murphy, Mike Montsour and Chris Kyle
[02:36:21] it carried the spirit of my friends Ryan Job Adam Brown, Mike McGrivi, Kevin Houston
[02:36:27] and the 79 other men who have made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and the brotherhood since 9-11
[02:36:35] I didn't know why God spared me but I did know I would find a way into the future
[02:36:43] what I would use each and every day to honor my brothers who had not made it home
[02:36:58] and I think obviously you've done a lot to honor our brothers and I think you continue to do that
[02:37:10] obviously every day with what you're doing and how you're doing it and how you're taking
[02:37:15] the lessons that you learned and bringing them to more people spreading the word broadly
[02:37:26] what did that transition look like like the you know from the time you got out into where you are now
[02:37:32] because you know I mean obviously everyone that's in the military right now
[02:37:35] one day I hate to break the news to y'all one day you're gonna be not in the military anymore
[02:37:43] bring us from you know the end of your career into where you are now and where your focus right now
[02:37:47] and what you're doing yeah absolutely I think that transition is a lot harder than people realize
[02:37:54] I think a lot of things I'm sure you experience this we take for granted the level of
[02:37:59] structure that exists in the military and suddenly you get out in the spilling world and that's not
[02:38:04] there I was a little bit fortunate enough that I had launched the nonprofit when it
[02:38:09] where later it'd become the combat when the coalition while I was still on active duty but
[02:38:15] so when I got out that kind of became my focus got it I will say that I made the mistake that a lot
[02:38:21] of military members and especially special operations members make when they get out I tried to
[02:38:27] do everything everything I saw was an opportunity that I didn't want to lose out on and I
[02:38:34] falsely convinced myself yeah I have the ability to do that so running the nonprofit we did a
[02:38:39] lot of amazing things you know two and a half million dollars we helped thousands of wounded warriors
[02:38:45] even created a a program specifically to help wounded warriors build structure find their new passion
[02:38:53] but what I started to realize and I was doing all this while I was still trying to speak
[02:38:57] and develop content and work on things and take care of a family and kids and all these things
[02:39:02] and I kind of had an epiphany in 2018 I'd been doing this but you know I had retired in 2013
[02:39:09] so five years I've been doing this and I suddenly realized you've got to find that one thing
[02:39:17] that you truly are going to make a difference at and I took a step back in 2018 and said where can
[02:39:24] I have the most impact and what really is my new mission what drives my passion where is my
[02:39:30] destination where am I going to set that course to go and I realize I look back you know we're doing
[02:39:35] a lot of great things with the nonprofit but there's 43,000 veteran nonprofits out there
[02:39:40] we are losing more guys to suicide right now then we lost to the enemy and I said okay so one
[02:39:48] option is you go create a whole no they're nonprofit but there's a lot of good ones out there and I
[02:39:52] think that's part of the problem it's diluting some of the message so I said maybe
[02:39:57] I'm better off focusing on helping a whole bunch of people with this message and lending my
[02:40:05] support to another organization so myself and the board made the decision that we were going to
[02:40:10] phase down our organization in 2018 and 2019 made that shift that I'm totally focusing on delivering
[02:40:18] this content to help people overcome adversity to to launch themselves out of failure and to not only
[02:40:26] survive which some people just survive from these life ambushes from these massive catastrophic
[02:40:32] events but to thrive from them to use them as a launch point to get better and to understand how to
[02:40:39] do that and because I realize man you know this you've written all this amazing content on it and
[02:40:44] all that is coming into the second book that will come out December called over come so
[02:40:51] I have online courses that are getting ready to come on board here in the next couple of months
[02:40:56] and I just want to get out there and help as many people as I can and then lend myself to some
[02:41:00] of the organizations that are out there that are helping our wounded warriors specifically with
[02:41:06] post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injuries one of the things I've started doing a lot of
[02:41:11] research and what we're beginning to understand is I used to think that if we could help guys find a
[02:41:17] new purpose after they got out it would help solve their problems wounded warriors but what we're
[02:41:22] beginning to understand is that we have never the way we train now and the way we have fought
[02:41:29] wars is exposing guys especially in front line combat units and special operation units to
[02:41:36] level of blast that we've never and and up until this point the way we train the military we haven't
[02:41:43] done before so I mean you look at our breachers and how many blasts we expose them to just
[02:41:48] in training and what we're starting to see I mean I've had multiple friends now that have killed
[02:41:54] themselves who I said no way no way and I've watched these downward slides and what we're starting
[02:42:01] to find out is we are creating physiological impacts on the brain from these continued exposures
[02:42:07] to these blasts so we need more research we need you know we need more non-pharmicological solutions
[02:42:13] to these problems and there's a lot of things that are out there that are on the forefront so one
[02:42:19] of the things with research I started doing some stuff with the concussion legacy foundation which
[02:42:23] is the same group working with the NFL or you know highlighting the impact of CTE on NFL
[02:42:28] players and we're beginning to realize that some of our special operations guys like Rob Guzo
[02:42:35] who took his life severe CTE but what they figured out is it's different some of the pre-mear
[02:42:42] neurologists that are out there are figuring out it's different it's blast and the blast goes
[02:42:48] all the way through the brain as opposed to a concussion that creates an impact and there's
[02:42:52] a centralized location now for guys or even Dallas out there that have had multiple concussions that
[02:42:58] creates more but the bottom line is we need this research so I donated my brain to the concussion
[02:43:04] legacy foundation and I'm encouraging all the veterans that are out there if you have been in combat
[02:43:09] don't hate your brain you don't need it you don't need it when you're gone and they're not
[02:43:15] going to come early and collect you know but the bottom line is it is an amazing way to be
[02:43:21] able to give back to the veterans that are coming up behind you because they don't have enough
[02:43:27] veteran brains in the brain banks that are out there to understand the kind of trauma we're
[02:43:31] putting on our brains and until they and and obviously they can't study the brains while we're still
[02:43:37] alive so if if you want a way to get back look up the concussion legacy foundation and don't
[02:43:43] at your brain I did it we need the research twenty thirty years from now we can make a difference to
[02:43:48] save some young lawyer that's out there that got exposed to blasts and now can't figure out why
[02:43:55] his world is falling apart around him so those are my passions that's my purpose and I want to
[02:44:02] help as many people out there I want to make you better help you thrive from adversity help you
[02:44:06] thrive from failure and crisis and for our wounded warriors I want to help try and solve this
[02:44:13] epidemic we're seeing in the suicides in the brain trauma yeah that's I mean that's just
[02:44:18] awesome it's awesome see moving forward with that and I know it would be going for a while here
[02:44:25] and that's probably a pretty good place to wrap where do you where can people find you
[02:44:30] where should people locate you and when they want to when they want to hear from you yeah absolutely
[02:44:35] best place go to Jason Redmond dot com that's my website and you can see what I'm doing

[02:44:46] and Jason Redmond WW on Instagram and Twitter awesome echo speaking of making people better
[02:44:57] you have any quick recommendations on how you know we can improve ourselves sure this is echo
[02:45:03] Charles by the way I have one question in Ranger School when they told you to like all right
[02:45:08] when they asked you you need your Gucci was that the thing that kind of sent you over there when
[02:45:14] they said the Gucci thing no I don't think it was that I really it was it was the land nav
[02:45:20] comments I mean I taught land nav so the funny thing about that Gucci jacket is so the army guys
[02:45:27] were only allowed to wear the army jacket liner well we didn't have those and I had Gucci
[02:45:34] batagonia I had the remember the green for me said came yeah that's what I had so every day I put
[02:45:40] that on the Ranger instructors would lose their mind and and in the beginning I had such a bad
[02:45:47] attitude that I just took it in the negative way but the second time I went through it became the
[02:45:53] how often can I put this on and spend these so I still have it every time I pull it out of my
[02:46:02] closet it puts a smile on my face nice nice what else yeah no that's it for questions yeah yeah
[02:46:08] we can talk about getting better though yeah and and Jay's about to start training jjitsu boom
[02:46:13] so he's gonna need a jjitsu key so we need to get that hooked up where we're gonna hook him up with a key from
[02:46:23] origin 100% not even 99% 100% 100% or an all-made in America that's what we need you know continue to
[02:46:27] grow this country yes sir so yeah origin if you're into jjitsu getting into jjitsu or already
[02:46:33] and jjitsu you want a key a new key or another key i thought you're gonna say used key
[02:46:40] you know you don't use the market for used geese no there's a lot of people who are
[02:46:46] at the parent he there's people out there that would love a jjaco game but that gets a little weird
[02:46:50] yeah that doesn't smell good well yeah maybe some some people maybe if someone like
[02:46:57] lost weight or something you know you use this game you were out these two eventually you were out
[02:47:03] of geese or you get a new one I was talking to Pete the other day the amount of
[02:47:06] geopants or geese period that have been returned is like so as said yeah we get like three
[02:47:14] geese back a year with some of the action warrants about they just don't wear out the
[02:47:17] warrants and geese just do not wear out yeah so get something up yeah you gotta like um yeah
[02:47:23] like if you lose weight or something and then you don't use it anymore or if you're like you get
[02:47:27] the new one and you know all like you turn you back to the old one because the new one that's the
[02:47:31] new hotness you know you don't really wear it anymore so you give it to your friend or something like this
[02:47:35] check that out like there's that you get these rash guards t-shirts uh other stuff yeah supplements
[02:47:43] supplements joint warfare joint warfare and cruel oil turned out to be the most important supplements
[02:47:50] there are in my opinion they thought it was a protein powder and the creatine that's what we thought
[02:47:55] in the beginning many more joint joint warfare hundred percent these we thought that yeah well
[02:48:00] yes I agree we do have Joe Warfare control and if you do want protein you might as well
[02:48:07] enjoy it yes get yourself some milk it's still good for you get on the milk we need the
[02:48:13] protein that's where we have milk which have you tried milk I have okay we need to use some milk
[02:48:19] and especially well it depends what flavors you like I like mint chocolate chip I am a fan of
[02:48:26] okay so each is a mint milk but apparently doc Luke hates mint well apparently he was going
[02:48:32] berserker the other day saying why would you drink something that tastes like toothpaste yeah
[02:48:38] yeah but so as it turns out some you know to back to another fence analogy some it's like you
[02:48:45] either love it or you really don't like it that's what as it turns out that's the situation with them
[02:48:50] we got mint peanut butter chocolate vanilla gorilla I'm a huge fan peanut butter chocolate
[02:48:55] okay okay that's my jam I do like mint chocolate but I got hostile with my whole family the
[02:49:02] other day well not with my whole family with my wife and my youngest daughter because there was
[02:49:08] no I wanted some yogurt and there was no blueberry there was no strawberry there was no coconut
[02:49:14] there was only vanilla and so I started saying why would a human being in 2019 buy vanilla yogurt
[02:49:23] like chewed and all that yeah I get if it comes in the variety pack and you end up with it
[02:49:29] you understood but straight up select it no wrong answer yeah so I had to get hostile super
[02:49:36] hostile and I was telling my wife and my youngest daughter that they are crazy for just
[02:49:40] liking that vanilla yeah they are for sure but at the end of the day you don't get to understand
[02:49:45] I was other people they have other opinions my my youngest daughter nine years old she makes
[02:49:50] so what she does is she takes strawberries caught some up and then she puts a whipped cream on it
[02:49:55] and then she takes warrior kid milk strawberry and sprinkles that nice yeah
[02:50:01] cornmeal so chocolate protein yeah well protein protein from yeah cool yeah it's good
[02:50:07] oh yeah where you can milk that's for the kids right little more formula like that I know
[02:50:12] that possibly do drink it like me they sneak it yes they do also if you want to represent
