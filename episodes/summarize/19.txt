He's not, Yeah, I know everything, you know, it's kind of like, I don't know at all, you know? That's the way it is when you build trust and you take the time and you build the relationship and you prove over and over again that you're going to do the right thing and the right situation and that you're going to take accountability and responsibility when something goes wrong and that you have a good head on your shoulders and that you're not going to get emotional about things and you do all those things and that you're driving and supporting the mission. But some people, they, you know, it's like that's kind of their, I don't want to say they're Lot in life because it sounds kind of like it's a bad thing. A lot of times, you know, how like you'll be like, hey, you know, say something in your saying it at all, call me whatever. So if, if you're wounded in the street, and there's machine gun fire going on, and I say, you know what, I don't want to do this, but I'm just going to pretend to be brave right now. People like you and people like me, people with families and friends and hopes and dreams and jobs and lives. Yeah, you know, you didn't have to face these terrible horrors that lied beyond day, 10, day, 11, 14, 15, you know, and then it just keeps going until you fall off. Now, and also, Michael, in the other direction where you don't want to show that you're frustrated, or you don't want to show that you're angry, or you don't want to show, you know, if you're, if you've got your team looking at you and you, and you're, you don't want to show that you're frustrated. And like I said for the jujitsu versus striking, I think this is spot on the jujitsu and the grappling is as far superior way, like I said of controlling people than striking is. They become defenders because they know what it's like to be bullied so they don't like to see other people get bullied. Where if someone has a cup and is like, you know, help me, you know, give me money basically. Yeah, and you're going to break at some point, you know, and everyone is in like I said, it's just the way you're made up as your genetic code. You know, so it's like one of those jobs where it, it, you know, big way. But before that, I do have to let you know, I don't know, Jaco, just in case you didn't know we were sponsored by on it. They don't want like all this trick in advice, you know, but that generally speaking, I'm not going to categorize there. And some people, their cup, get filled up, especially when they are lucky or unlucky enough as we just discussed, to survive day after day after day after day after day and 14 days of thinking that you're going to die and seeing your friends get wounded or killed. And I think the reading, like, if someone could just inject all the information into your brain, then people would do it, you know. You don't have to know everything about this particular job that you're going into or what you don't need to know everything. And they're like, oh, he's like, hey, well, why don't you lead these people out of here, right? So I know a lot of people, they'll be like maybe a follow-up question to some questions on here, or something that they've heard. So I'm going to contribute to a program that gets people on their feet, Basically giving people the tools to help themselves, right? So if you're like, if you're rolling and you know GJ2 now and a bully tries to bully you, he will gather immediately in this program's like specific programs. Like, you know, so everyone's all nice and real weak and stuff like that. Yeah, it's like his humility is like, it's so genuine that that's one of his many worries of being a leader, you know? If you have time to, I don't know, go to the beach or, I don't know, whatever you do in your spare time. I'm going to fight and I'm going to battle and I'm going to use every tool I have to crush my enemy. But it's one that people always have a hard time getting their head around because I always said like, my boss did whatever I want him to do. I'm going to make, I'm going to lead up the chain of command and I'm going to get my superiors to let us do what we need to do to do it effectively. Because a lot of this negative press, like like this guy is saying, hey, we're getting more shootings, we're getting more beatings.
