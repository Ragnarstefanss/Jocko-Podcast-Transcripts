00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16 This is Jockelpoccast number 323 with echo Charles and me,
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:06.40 Jockelwillink. Good evening, I killed you.
00:00:06.40 --> 00:00:10.20 Also, joining us tonight is Jason Gardner. Good evening, Jason.
00:00:10.20 --> 00:00:11.20 Good evening.
00:00:14.20 --> 00:00:21.20 The inspiration of a noble cause involving human interests foreign-wide enables men to do things.
00:00:21.20 --> 00:00:24.40 They did not dream themselves capable of before,
00:00:24.40 --> 00:00:29.40 and which they were not capable of alone.
00:00:30.40 --> 00:00:36.40 The consciousness of belonging vitally to something beyond individuality,
00:00:36.60 --> 00:00:43.40 of being part of a personality that reaches we know not where in space and time,
00:00:43.60 --> 00:00:49.000 greatness the heart to the limits of the soul's ideal,
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000 and builds out the supreme of character.
00:00:55.40 --> 00:00:59.20 It was something like this, I think, which marked our motive,
00:00:59.40 --> 00:01:03.40 which made us strong to fight the bitter fight to the victorious end,
00:01:03.40 --> 00:01:11.000 and made us unrevengeful in that victory.
00:01:12.20 --> 00:01:18.60 We rose in soul above the things which even the declaration of independence
00:01:18.60 --> 00:01:22.80 announces the inanelable rights of human nature.
00:01:23.80 --> 00:01:28.000 For the securing of which governments are instituted among men,
00:01:28.20 --> 00:01:34.40 happiness, liberty, life, we laid on the altar of offering,
00:01:35.20 --> 00:01:38.000 or committed to the theories of destruction,
00:01:38.20 --> 00:01:42.60 while our minds were lifted up to a great thought,
00:01:42.80 --> 00:01:45.000 and our hearts swelled to its measure.
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.40 We were back and on by the vision of destiny.
00:01:49.60 --> 00:01:55.40 We saw our country moving forward, charged with the sacred trust of man.
00:01:56.60 --> 00:02:02.000 We believed in its glorious career, the power of high aims,
00:02:02.20 --> 00:02:06.20 and of strong purpose, the continuity of great endeavor,
00:02:06.40 --> 00:02:10.000 the onward upward path of history to God.
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000 Every man felt that he gave himself to and belonged to something beyond time,
00:02:19.20 --> 00:02:23.000 and above place, something which could not die.
00:02:26.80 --> 00:02:32.000 These are the reasons, not fixed in the form of things,
00:02:32.20 --> 00:02:35.000 but formative of things.
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.60 The reasons of the soul why we fought for the union.
00:02:40.60 --> 00:02:46.80 And this is the spirit in which having overcome the dark powers of the Nile and disintegration,
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000 having restored the people of the south to their place and privilege in the union
00:02:52.20 --> 00:02:59.40 and set on high the old flag, telling of one life and one body, one freedom and one law,
00:02:59.40 --> 00:03:05.80 over all the people and all the land between the four great waters.
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000 We now come as it were home.
00:03:11.60 --> 00:03:14.000 We look into each other's eyes.
00:03:14.20 --> 00:03:16.60 We speak in softer tones.
00:03:16.80 --> 00:03:21.80 We gather under the atmosphere of these sacred thoughts and memories,
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.20 like the high pure air that shines down upon us today,
00:03:26.20 --> 00:03:34.20 flooding these fields, fields where cloud and flash and thunder roll of battle and shrouded us,
00:03:34.40 --> 00:03:42.20 and them in that great three days burial to celebrate this resurrection,
00:03:42.80 --> 00:03:48.80 to rear on these far away field memorials of familiar names,
00:03:48.80 --> 00:03:55.80 and to honor the state whose honor it was to rear such manhood.
00:04:03.80 --> 00:04:13.80 And those are remarks that were delivered on October 3rd, 1889 by General Joshua Chamberlain,
00:04:13.80 --> 00:04:23.80 who, with the 20th main, led the defense of the left flank of the Union Army on a hill known as Little Round Top,
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000 during the Battle of Gettysburg.
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000 And Joshua Chamberlain was in incredible soldier,
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000 an incredible leader, a warrior, a scholar, a thinker.
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000 He's most well known for his deeds as a military leader.
00:04:45.40 --> 00:04:53.000 You receive the Medal of Honor for his heroic leadership there in Gettysburg.
00:04:53.60 --> 00:05:00.000 That was only part of his life. He served, certainly four years in the Army.
00:05:00.40 --> 00:05:06.000 But during that time, he participated in some of the fiercest fighting of the war.
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.60 Over 20 engagements, including Frederick's bird, Chancellor's field Gettysburg, Spotsilvania, Cold Harbor,
00:05:12.80 --> 00:05:18.000 Peter's Burg, and five forks, he was wounded six times during battle.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000 Two of those times nearly fatal.
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:36.000 He was chosen by Grant to receive the first flag of surrender at the Apomotics Court House on April 12, 1865.
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000 Then went on to be elected governor of Maine four times served as President of Bowden College.
00:05:45.60 --> 00:05:48.000 He was a lawyer, he was a real estate developer.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.000 At the age of 70, even though his health had been severely impacted by his war wounds,
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000 he volunteered to lead troops in the Spanish American War.
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000 He was denied by the Secretary of War.
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000 He wrote a book called Bayonet Forward, my Civil War, Reminiscences.
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000 We're going to cover it today. Jason and I have had the privilege of walking the battlefield of Gettysburg.
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000 We do an event at Eschner Front called EF battlefield.
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000 And during that event, we look at all the different leaders.
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:44.000 And there's a bunch of different leaders. And with a bunch of different personalities, the good, the bad, the ugly, we have mead and lee, we got Beaufort and Long Street,
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000 Hancock and you all, cycles and steward, and every one of those people.
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000 And there's many more that we discuss there on the battlefield.
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000 There are complex people in a complex situation making complex leadership decisions.
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000 Some write, some wrong, some insignificant, some completely consequential.
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:26.000 But for me, the one individual that stands out from all those leaders is Joshua Chamberlain, with so many lessons to learn.
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000 And we're going to explore some of those today as we go through some highlights of his book.
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000 Does anyone stand out more than Joshua Chamberlain when you go to Gettysburg?
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:48.000 And they all stand out, mead stands out, lee stands out, long street, but they all have these dynamic moments, good and bad.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:01.000 But as far as just overall, when you look at the whole thing together, just from Gettysburg, Chamberlain is he stands out in an epic way.
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000 The whole experience of being on that battlefield is almost impossible to put into words.
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000 Because there's more to it.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000 It's not like we're in a classroom and we're learning about the history of stuff.
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000 There's something that I can't explain that you feel when you're there.
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000 And he touched on this in a speech that he gave later and I was like, oh, okay.
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000 What he said was, in great deed, something abides, on great field, something stays.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000 Forms change in past, bodies disappear, but spirits linger to consecrate the ground for the vision place of souls.
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:58.000 And reverent men and women from afar and generations that know us not and that we know not of heart drawn to see where and by whom great things were suffered and done for them.
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000 She'll come to this deathless field to ponder and dream and low.
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000 The shadow of a mighty presence shall wrap them in its bosom and the power of the vision pass into their souls.
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:26.000 And that's what it's like, you're there and you're feel like you're part of something that's bigger than you and the it's just it's it's an immensely.
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000 Yeah, I'll say it's a life changing experience to go to that battlefield as an American.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:42.000 Yeah, there's there's something spiritual that goes down for lack of a better word. I don't know what other word to use. I'm not even 100% sure I know what the word spiritual means.
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000 I think that's the best.
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:59.000 I don't know what else to say when when you when you walk on that battlefield and when you know what happened and when you know the cost and when you know what the consequences were were we're going to be to win or lose there.
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:12.000 That everything that we have and the course of history is we know it and the course of free people in the world like it all is there in this one little area where.
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:25.000 Thousands of of of men stood toe to toe sometimes literally against their relatives and you know you when we walked that battlefield we point that out certain.
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:44.000 Battles where there's literally relatives fighting against each other and just to know the course of human history and and that that point in time and how important it was it's it is it's like a spiritual thing to be there.
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000 Possibly the most device decisive battle of the civil war.
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000 Because of things that gone the other way.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:04.000 You know what have affected the election and and and and when you actually walk there and you see that things were literally held by a thread.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000 Yeah, I mean case and point the 20th main and the left length of the union army attack after attack after attack and we'll get to it.
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:25.000 All right, I'm going to go to the book going to the battle of Frederick's bird as a Virginia December 11th through the 15th 1862.
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000 By the way, I didn't check on the weather, but December 1862 this was crazy.
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:41.000 So we make boots right at origin the they they the boots that these guys wore were boots called single last boots.
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000 And what that means is they don't have a left foot in the right foot.
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000 There's just one shape for the boots and it's a wooden soul.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000 So it's a piece of wood with leather attached to it and you get a left and a right is the same.
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000 That's like the comfort level that these dudes are in.
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000 It's a freaking nightmare.
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.000 Here we go.
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000 So we were held and reserved.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000 It may be thought that we were glad to be kept out of the fight at least for the present.
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000 But I take a occasion to say that informing for a great fight.
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000 It is not regarded as a very special favor to be held and reserved.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000 The holding is most likely not for long.
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000 And it holds itself a peculiar stress and strain, waiting and watching intent and anxious.
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000 Sturd by the pulse of manhood and the contagion of comradeship.
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000 Conscious of the strength to help but forbidden to strike.
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000 All this wears sorely on every generous spirit.
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000 This guy is such a freaking incredible writer.
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000 It's mind boggling.
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000 But that is such a great thing.
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000 And as I was reading, I was like this is the first thing I'm going to read in this book.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:03.000 Because only if you've been sitting on the battlefield when there's something happening and you can't do anything or you're being held,
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000 quote, in reserve.
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000 And you know what it feels like to be like, I want to go help but I can't.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000 And my what did you say?
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000 My manhood wants to go help but I can't.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000 But then he gets this.
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000 Then he says this.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000 And that other not unmanly impulse.
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000 If the worst is coming, let us meet it.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000 May have its part two in the drama.
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.000 It is really less trying to go in first and deliver your blow in the flush of spirit and strength with the feeling that if the worst comes, you will be reinforced or relieved.
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:47.000 Then to be held back till some dire disaster calls when the life and death grapple clinches and you must recover lost ground or die trying.
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000 That's another crazy thing. Like when you're the reserves, hey, if everything goes good, you're not doing anything.
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000 And if everything goes bad, you're going to go jump into this freaking mayhem and get some the worst place.
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000 Yeah, the worst possible place.
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000 Or on the other hand, you can be called to advance in triumph over a field already carried something then is lacking to the manly sense of service rendered according to strength.
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000 So this reserve for him is a lose lose situation.
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000 You're the good and called into a freaking blood bath.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000 In which case this is going to be horrible and you didn't have the chance to strike when you were like ready to rock and roll.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000 Or they're going to win and you know, you just get to roll in there and be like, well, you guys did a good job high five.
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000 That's got to be an uncomfortable feeling.
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000 It says,
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:52.000 Um, this is this is good or bad, depending on your reserve state of mind. We could plainly see the fear struggle of our second and nine core lines.
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000 First, steadily moving forward in perfect order and array, the flag high, poised and leading,
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000 checked and broken somewhat on each successive rise under the first range of shot and shell.
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000 No musket replying this for this would have been worse than useless, but bright bayonets fixed.
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000 Ready at the final reach to sweep like a sharp wave crest over the enemies rock like barrier.
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000 So he's watching this unfold and you can see the you can see the soldiers kind of coming up out of the rise of, you know,
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000 coming up on a little, a little null and then sinking back down and they're watching this.
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000 He says right on.
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:39.000 Then reaching the last slope before and beneath the death delivering stone wall suddenly allumed by a sheet of flame and in an instant,
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:50.000 the whole line sinking as if swallowed up in the earth, the bright flags, quenched and gloom and only a arriving mass marking that high tide,
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000 halt of utter most manhood and supreme endeavor.
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:11.000 So these guys march up to that wall and then you know, however many Confederate soldiers just engage and the blast of those rounds at close range and it just immediately stops them.
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:25.000 Then a slow back flowing with despairing effort here and there to bear back broken bodies of the brave glorified by the baptism of blood.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000 I'm just going to go through all some little I got to go English major here for a minute, but that a little relation right there.
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000 That a little relation there to bear back broken bodies of the brave glorified by the baptism of blood.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000 This guy gets a applause on that good war.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:56.000 Freaking incredible again and again the bold essay repeated by other troops with similar experience and thickening ridges of the fallen marking the desperate essays.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:06.000 There we stood for an hour witnessing five immortal charges tears ran down the cheeks of stern man waiting almost wishing,
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000 wishing to be summoned to the same futile glorious work.
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:33.000 So there's these guys standing up in reserve watching five charges watching guys get moat down their crying as they're watching their friends get killed and wishing to be called in to do their duty.
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000 Just to get it over with.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000 Yeah.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000 Yeah.
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:49.000 If you're standing in line to go into a meet grinder, you want to be the first one or like 30 back watching it come slow.
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000 Good grief.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:03.000 Now came the call for the reserves.
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.000 Burnside despairing of the left and seeing the heroic value on the right at last exhausted in unavailing sacrifice ordered in the fifth core griffin's division to lead.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000 First came the silent departure of our first and second brigades whose courage our eyes could not follow.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:29.000 We waited in expectation not in fear for that has little place in manhood when love and duty summoned but eager to do our best and make the finish.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:40.000 Few words were spoken among officers however endeared to each other by confidence is deepened by such pressure of life on the borders of death as war compels.
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000 The sense of responsibility silenced all else.
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000 Silence in the ranks too. One little word perhaps telling whom to right to.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:02.000 Griffin gave us a searching, wistful look, not trusting his lips and we not needing more.
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000 Now rang forth the thrilling bugle cry.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:22.000 Third brigade to the front.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000 I don't know man. I don't know if I have any comments.
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:40.000 You know like this guy is such an incredible writer and the way he conveys this it just doesn't need anything else.
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000 The story about this night was what really I highlighted on this battle and struck me.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000 When they eventually have to hold up for the night.
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000 First comes the charge.
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000 We were directed straight forward toward the left of the futile advance we had seen so fearfully cut down.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000 The fences sued compelled us to send our horses back. The artillery fire made havoc.
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000 Crushed bodies, severed limbs where everywhere around in streets, door yards and gardens.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:25.000 Our man began to fall and were taken up by the faithful surgeons and hospital attendance who also bring courage to their work.
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000 Now we reach the lines we were to pass for the further goal.
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000 We picked our way of mid-body's thickly strewn.
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:42.000 Some stark and cold, some silent with slowly ebbling life, some sharp agony that must have voice though unavailing.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000 Some prone from sheer exhaustion or by final order of hopeless commander.
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000 The living from their close clung blism of the earth strove to dissuade us.
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:03.000 It's no use boys, we've tried that. Nothing living can stand there. It's only for the dead.
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:12.000 On we pushed up slope slippery with blood, mire with repeated unavailing tread.
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000 We reached that final crest before that all commanding counter-manting stone wall.
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:28.000 Here we exchange fierce valleys at every disadvantage until the muzzle flame deepened the sunset red and all is dark.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:36.000 We step back a little behind the shelter in this four-long, foremost crest and sank to silence.
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000 Perhaps, such as human weakness, to sleep.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000 So as they're marching on this assault where they've watched five charges fail,
00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:00.000 as they're stepping over bodies and limbs. And guys, some laying quietly, dying and some screaming out and agony.
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:12.000 And some laying wounded are looking up at them and saying, stop, it's no use. Don't go, we already tried it.
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000 And they press on.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:26.000 And they basically get into a gunfight at that wall and then it gets dark.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000 And this is the part that you're talking about. It was a cold night, bitter, raw north wind,
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000 swept, start slopes. The man heated by their energetic and exciting work.
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:48.000 felt keenly the chilling change. I rose at midnight as we advanced over that strict and fueled the grave,
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:58.000 conglomerate monotone resolved itself into its diverse several elements, some breathing in articulate agony,
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:12.000 some deer home names, some begging for a drop of water, some caring for some for a caring word, some praying God for strength to bear some for life, some for quick death.
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000 We did what we could.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000 But how little it was on a field so boundless for a feeble human reach.
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:36.000 So they're just up there laid up sleeping with with the dead and the dying.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000 By the way, I'm not reading this whole book.
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000 You know, we're talking earlier on. I said, hey, it's going to be hard. It was hard for me to pick out like, what am I going to read?
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000 Because you literally this book, you could just read the entire thing. Just do the audio book.
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000 I could just do that and just call it just be like, I'm just going to read this whole thing.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000 And maybe I will do that. This is a plot. This is, there's no way this is being protected by copyright or anything like that.
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000 It's too old. So I may be able to do a audio book.
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000 Yeah, I'm not there as well.
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:12.000 My dad just tried to get a copy of it. It wasn't readily available yet to get it like from an outside cell on Amazon.
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000 Oh, the book itself.
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000 This one, yeah.
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000 Yeah, it will be reprinted now, which is awesome.
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000 But may I have to just go straight, audio book on this thing.
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000 It's off to you because there are some words in here. I'm not used to.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000 Yeah.
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000 It's not that bad. There's worse.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000 He's, he, even though they're definitely, I think there's definitely words that are challenging,
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:44.000 but it still, he speaks pretty plainly. You know, I mean, compared to some stuff from back in the day,
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000 this is really back in the day, echo Charles.
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000 He's a plain speaker, but man, it's funny.
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000 I never picked up on that a little relation. He's, I didn't pick it up up on it because I haven't been reading it out loud.
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000 So you start reading out loud.
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000 That a little relation. Have you ever read the shameless,
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000 Haney version of bailwolf?
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000 No.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000 Okay. So bailwolf, the way it's written in, what is it, old English?
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000 Um, gotta hope I got that right.
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000 Yeah, it's old English.
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000 It's written the way that they wrote it's written with a literation.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000 So all the sounds are fought for you and Tida, but Tida, Tida,
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000 it's like the same vowels, right?
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.000 Yeah.
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000 And so when Shameh is Haney did the translation into modern English,
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000 he managed to find words to make the whole thing have that same a literation throughout the book.
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000 It's, it's powerful.
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000 That guy's got to be a wizard. Oh, yeah.
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000 He's, he seems super smart.
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000 I think he's like one of the most recognized.
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000 Is, you know, there's that thing people do where they like,
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000 hey, what's the one person that you'd like to have dinner with?
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000 Data relies to fill out those questions.
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000 Definitely you could sit for hours with Joshua.
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000 Yeah.
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000 Just listen to him talk because it's, it's like, it took me a second.
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000 I was like, getting a cold swimming pool to get used to it.
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000 And then once I was used to it, I was like, gosh,
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000 I really like the way that he speaks.
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000 Yeah.
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000 And, and then you know, sometimes I would be saying like,
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000 text Iris, like, I'm going to endeavor to get the kids ready for school.
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000 And then my efforts will be pointed towards ensuring that the horses are fed.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000 Yeah.
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000 Oh, he's, and maybe it can cause this stuff.
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000 It's awesome.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000 Yep.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000 Um, the, the, so these guys are up there all night.
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000 It's, it's a, it's a horror show.
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000 It's a horror show.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000 Um, no big deal.
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000 Just sleep it on dead guys.
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000 Fast forward a little bit.
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000 Waken by the sharp fire.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000 Soon came a storm of bullets from the front and flanked to route us from our
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000 light shelter in the hollow between the two outermost crests of the manifold assault.
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000 Not so, this, not sufficing.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000 The artillery took up the task trying to rain down Shell upon us and sweep
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000 Solid shot through our huddled group.
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000 We had to lie flat on the earth.
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000 And only by careful twisting could any man load and fire is musket against the
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000 covered line in the front.
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000 Before long, we saw two or three hundred of the enemy creep out from the right of their
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000 stone wall and take advantage of a gully bank where the ground fell away from our left
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000 to get a full flank fire on us.
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000 This situation was critical.
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000 We took a warrant of supreme necessity.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000 We laid up a breastwork of dead bodies to cover that exposed flank.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000 Behind this, we managed to live through the day.
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000 No man could stand up and not be laid down again hard.
00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:03.000 I saw a man lift his head by the prop of his hands and forearms and catch a bullet in the middle of his forehead.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000 Such recklessness was forbidden.
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000 We laid there all day, hearing the dismal thud of the bullets into the dead flesh of our life-saving
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000 bulwarks.
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000 No relief could dare to reach us.
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000 Reinforcements, we did not wish.
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:40.000 So they get flanked and they have to build a wall of their dead friends to protect them.
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000 Fast forward a little bit.
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000 They get ordered back to Fredrick'sburg.
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000 Night came again and made way of it the order to remove and take a respect within the city.
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000 We had to pick our way over a field strewn with incongruous ruin.
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000 Men torn and broken and cut to pieces in every indescribable way.
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:12.000 Canon dismounted, guncarriages smashed or overturned ammunition chests flung wildly about horses dead and half dead,
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000 still held in harness, accutraments of every sort scattered as by whirlwinds.
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:27.000 It was not good for the nerves that ghastly march in the lowering night.
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:34.000 Just after midnight of this miserable day, we were summoned three regiments of us to set forth on some special service.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000 We knew not what or where, something very serious we must believe.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:47.000 We were bound for the extreme front to form a picket line to cover the center of the field while the army was to take a look at the ground.
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000 The army was to take some important action.
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000 Colonel Ames commanded our line, the regiment coming under my charge.
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000 The last order came in low tones.
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000 Hold this ground at all hazards and to the last.
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000 A strange query crossed our minds last of what?
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000 No dictionary held that definition.
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:28.000 As a general term, this reached the infinite.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:36.000 We were pretty well buried and braced for the coming dawn when a strange clatter came up from the left rear and a gasping voice called,
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000 Where is the commander of these troops?
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:47.000 I acknowledge that responsibility. Get yourselves out of this quick as God will let you. The whole army is across the river was the message.
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000 Her no doubt by the whole hostile picket line. This was a critical moment.
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000 Something must be said and done quickly.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000 Steading your places, my man, I ordered.
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000 One or two of you arrest this stamp Peter.
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000 This is a ruse of the enemy.
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000 We'll give it to them in the morning.
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:16.000 This was spoken with no suppressed or hesitating tone but pitched for the benefit of our astonished neighbors in double darkness in our front.
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:24.000 My man caught the keynote of my policy, trusted my discretion and held themselves quiet.
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000 Talk about badass.
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000 Quick thinking too.
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000 So he's up there, for you get with their picket line, where they're expecting this massive fight.
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000 Somebody comes up on horseback and says, hey, the entire army is across the way.
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000 Get out of here as quick as you can. Go.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000 And he knows this guy's unimposter.
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000 And says, stay calm and cool.
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000 And says it loud enough so that the enemy can hear him.
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000 I step back to the staff officer and rebuked him severely for his rassnish pointing out to him the state of things.
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000 Vect at having to moderate even the even my stress of voice.
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000 He explained he had had such a time getting over the field on up to hit this front line.
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000 He almost lost his wits.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000 So that was a union guy.
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000 No.
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000 Oh yes. Yes.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000 Yeah. And he was quick enough to go, hey, arrest this enemy guy and he's like, hey, come here before.
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000 Yeah.
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000 You almost made everybody run away.
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000 I step back to the staff officer, revoked him severely for his rassnish pointing out to him.
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000 Putting out to him the state of things, vexed at having to moderate even the stress of my voice,
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000 which something that we talk about all the time is like staying calm.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000 And that's an important thing.
00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000 And even the way you speak is going to impact the other people around you and he knows that.
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000 Vect is a world that I need to use more.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000 Yeah.
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000 Vect is a good word.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000 One of my friends growing up.
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:19.000 He had another friend that, I don't know, he had a adopted brother that was from like someone in the islands like Jamaica or something.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000 And he would do something that would make his brother mad.
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000 His brother would say, you're vexing.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000 So I think that's a good, good time for this.
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000 Good, let's, let's bring back that word.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000 Order comes to leave.
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000 So eventually they do get, they do get the order to leave.
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000 It was a dreary retreat down those wrecked stream slopes.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000 It was hard enough to be stumbling over torn up sawds groups of the dead or forms of the city.
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000 Or forms of the solitary dying muskets dropped with quick relax or held fast with deaths,
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000 convulsive clutch swords bay and that's cartridge boxes fragments of everything everywhere.
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:07.000 But when a ghastly gleam of moonlight fell on the pale faces fixed and stark and on open eyes that saw not,
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000 but reflected uttermost things, it sent a shiver through us.
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000 I'm not used to fighting in the dark.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000 Right, can you imagine this? These guys, they're completely in the dark.
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000 And we always, we'd, we'd night vision or we could put flares up or whatever.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000 Just dark.
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000 What a mess.
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:44.000 The potential for blue on blue and some of the stuff he talks about where he like is trying to straighten up his guys and winds up talking to a Confederate soldier about where he's taking it.
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000 It's freaking nuts, dude.
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000 It's crazy.
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000 Yeah.
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000 It's kind of, at least the other people can't see either I guess.
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000 Yeah, no one can.
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000 No one can see.
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000 Did you ever go on any of those?
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000 Did you ever go to the jungle in the night?
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000 Yeah, I went down into jungle training in Panama.
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000 Yeah, I did that too.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000 And then basically we learned like you're not doing anything at night.
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000 You could stop.
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000 Yeah, you have to stop.
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:17.000 And you could patrol real quiet and slow, but like once you got an eye-ad it was a total disaster.
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:24.000 That's why the guys like the seals and nom that would patrol at night and set up an ambush.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000 Oh, they probably pop flares.
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000 Well, I don't think they patrol very far either.
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000 No, it's true.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000 Because you had to move so slow.
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000 Yeah.
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000 One of the Vietnam vets was telling me that they would go further than like 500 yards into the jungle on that was.
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000 And that would take like two hours through hours and typically up a canal.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000 So they were in the water most of the way and then out a little bit.
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000 It's a little easier to move in the water.
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000 And then the moon has a big impact in the desert, but in the jungle it's a lot less of an impact.
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000 None.
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000 Because you're under triple canopies.
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000 The, um, did you go down a paranormal?
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000 So that you got those black palms, black palms, which essentially is like why get bowed wire just
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000 just plant black palms everywhere.
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000 Black palms are a tree that are just covered in little thorns.
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000 That's a nice, not little fun. They're pretty big.
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000 And what sucks is when you're moving at night and you grab a hold of what you think is a tree to help you step over something and you
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000 Desend up with nine black palm freaking thorns in your hand.
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000 Yeah, I don't, I don't know how you can do it.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000 You just got it. You got a stop and wait.
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000 Yeah, you got to move slow.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:39.000 But at least like after a while your night vision could adjust and you could be like, okay, I can we can move.
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:46.000 But as soon as we did an eye at it night and you shooting and your night vision just out the window, that's when it was just.
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000 That's when it's complete blackness.
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:56.000 That they had us do like three eyes at night just so we knew what it was like and what the risks were.
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000 We were doing some training for a while called the AMP training, right?
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000 And what if we go to war with someone in theerson? We don't have night vision or any of that other stuff.
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.000 And so that was great because some of the Vietnam vets were contracting for us and they were talking about being able to smell the enemy.
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000 They're like, we'll walk down trails and we got our hands on the guys,
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000 Shoulder in front of us because we can't see and we don't want to risk getting lost.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000 And then sometimes we could smell the enemy coming before they actually showed up.
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.000 And the example he gave was there was a female with the Vietnamese and he could smell or shampoo.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:42.000 And then just start shooting, you know, it's like when you can they're that close that you're smelling them before you're seeing them.
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000 It's just crazy.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:53.000 He's got a section here to he says why we lost. Why the battle was lost?
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000 He says perhaps the main cause and he goes into some other details.
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000 I'm going to jump a little bit here. He says perhaps the main cause of this great disaster,
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000 the commander of the center grand division did not put his men in.
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:22.000 They were sent by superior orders and detachments to support other commands as a foreloin hope at various times in places during the unexpected developments or rather the almost inevitable accidents of the battle.
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000 It should not have been a disaster.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000 Franklin with his 60,000 men should have turned Lees right.
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:38.000 Whereas he attacked with only two divisions and that one at a time and did not follow up with his whole force with their splendid initiative.
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000 This is, you know, all about prioritizing the next few.
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000 You know, you're doing a little bit trying to solve this problem, trying to solve that problem, trying to solve another problem.
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000 It's like what is our major problem?
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000 And not keeping things simple either.
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000 That's true, too.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.000 When Franklin failed, it was rationalists to expect somener to carry the formidable heights beyond the city,
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000 made him pregnant with why Lees best skill and valor.
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:09.000 That front might have been held still under menace while somener reinforced perhaps by the main body of horker's grand division.
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:20.000 Might have concentrated upon Lees left above the city and flank the formidable bastions crowning the heights that entrenched his front with all that earth and manhood could do.
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000 That battle was not fought according to bird and sides intention.
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:35.000 And that his plan was mutilated by distrust and disharmony among his subordinates commanders does not exound orate him.
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000 This is going back to Napoleon, right?
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.000 Look, just be, if I tell you to do something, if I tell Jason to do something, I tell Echo to do something and you guys don't like me.
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000 You don't like my plan and so you go do something else.
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:56.000 That's not your fault, that's my fault for not fixing it and not getting you engaged in the plan and not letting accepting your input and asking what your opinion is.
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:09.000 It is the first great trust and place of a chief commander to control reluctant and incongruous elements and to make his, and to make subordinates and opponents submit to his imperial purpose.
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000 Now I'll tell you, what's the best way to get someone to submit to your imperial purpose is by saying, hey, Jason, how do you want to assault this target?
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000 That's the best way, not by saying, hey, here's what I'm imposing upon you to do.
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000 And you can take those words the wrong way and I don't think that's how we met him.
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.000 Like you can take it like, hey, you just need to impose your will, which is actually what he just said, impose your will on the imperial purpose.
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:43.000 But I think he met them in the way that you get people to do that by getting them involved with the plan and letting them take ownership and letting, you know, you're clining that ladder of alignment.
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000 Yep, that we talk about.
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000 Yes.
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000 And look, if I say, hey, no, Jason, this is what we're doing and you're like, hey, Roger that, got it boss.
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000 I don't agree with this plan, but I'm an ex-heardt.
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000 We're good.
00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000 Like you can be like, hey, there's times where you and I might disagree about something and I go, hey, listen, we don't have time to figure this out.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000 We got to go and we got to go now.
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000 So take five vehicles and go to that north side of that build of that compound and you're like,
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000 got it. That's okay.
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000 Like we don't have time to discuss this.
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000 Now, if you were like, hey, Jockel, that's a bad call.
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000 We shouldn't do that.
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000 Now I'm starting to question myself, okay, what does he see that I don't see?
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000 What does he understand that I understand?
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000 So, can you say, listen, this is what we got to do.
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000 We got to do it now.
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000 Time is of the essence.
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000 Yes.
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000 But if you're still getting pushed back, there's a problem.
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000 You can't overly trust yourself as a leader.
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000 I've never freaking trust myself. Like, I'm always thinking, what am I not seeing?
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000 What does Jason see that I don't see?
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000 What does Echo understand that I don't understand?
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000 What perspective do they have that I don't have?
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000 Here, and here's one of the things about doing what we talk about,
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000 Getty'sburg, right?
00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000 And sure I can learn a lot from the things that Chamberlain did.
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000 And Hancock and these other guys, what I really need to do is pay attention to when
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000 I'm acting like sickles and just not paying attention and pushing the line out,
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000 even though I was told not to when I'm doing that or when, you know,
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000 I'm behaving like Lee and I don't understand my subordinates perspective
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000 and I'm giving them obtuse directions.
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000 You know, and you always want to identify yourself with the heroes in any story,
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000 where the most growth is going to come from is where you go,
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000 wait, how are my like these people that really screwed this up and how can I fix that?
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000 And you will see yourself in your past.
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000 You'll be like, oh, I know when I did that.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000 And you'll see it in your present.
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000 Like, oh, I think I'm doing that right now.
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000 And then hopefully that will prevent you from making these mistakes in the future.
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000 And truly when you walk the grounds and you start to see what they see,
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000 a saw and see what they were looking at.
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000 And then you get to walk to the other person's perspective and see,
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000 oh, what does he mean by that order?
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:14.000 It's, it's very powerful to experience it and not just hear about it, for sure.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000 He says, burn side attempted of vindication somewhat on these lines,
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000 but too late. He prepared an order removing from command several as high ranking,
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:30.000 but too little subordinate generals and made ready to prefer charges against them for trial by court martial.
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000 So after this went down, he's like, oh, we're gonna fire some people.
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:42.000 And then this, but Lincoln again interposed his common sense advice and the matter was passed over.
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000 You can see Lincoln just a badass like, hey, listen, bro.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000 I know if you can Jason and Echo do exactly what you want him to do.
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000 Now you want to fire him, but you're the guy in charge.
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000 Quart Martialems a little more in fire.
00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:10.000 What's really cool about his observations through this battle on some other battles is it gives you an insight to what is made the seal team so successful.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000 What made the success was our ability to debrief stuff, basically where we take off rank, we're like, hey, what do we do right,
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000 where, what do we do wrong, what are our shortcomings?
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000 And he brings that out in this one and other ones where he just laying it out, it's like, hey,
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000 we're some of the issues like communication obviously is a huge issue.
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000 Guy is getting word of something on a dynamic battlefield that's happening as it happening,
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000 then he's giving new orders and by the time they get back and forth everything is changed.
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000 Can you imagine like someone's flanking you and then you go to tell someone, you know, hey, hey, Echo,
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000 go tell Jason that I'm getting flanked.
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000 Cool, 30 minutes later you get the word that I'm getting flanked and you say, well, you know,
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000 shift left and Echo comes back to me 30, I've already done.
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000 I'm already flanked. It's over. I either did something or I didn't do it,
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:09.000 but the whole thing, it's so that's why the decentralized command is so important in all these battles and
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:17.000 knowing it understated, you can tell when we get into some of these other battles like how well that worked in some situations and how
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:33.000 you know, Chamberlain in some cases kind of decides what he's going to do based on the orders that he thinks are going to be the most effective for the situation that's going down.
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:41.000 That's another weird thing you get to at Gettysburg, which we're about to talk about, but at Gettysburg sometimes the situation and we go into some good
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:50.000 depths on this when we go out there, but you know, one guy takes initiative and it turns out good and everyone's clapping on the back like he's a hero.
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:56.000 Another guy takes initiative, maybe in a little bit different manner and things go sideways and everyone calls this guy Jackass.
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:06.000 Well, well, there's reasons for that. And once we start to talk about the differences between person A takes initiative and it's good person B takes initiative and it's bad.
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:19.000 Oh, wait wait a second. Why was that good here and now it's bad. I actually have that leadership strategy in tactics this first between I did I like made a call even also new guy and my chiefs like, hey good job.
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:29.000 Three puttunes later I make a call my OIC's like, bro, what are you doing? Like I didn't want to do that and you have to dissect why was it good for me to take initiative here, but bad for me to take initiative here.
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:40.000 Oh, not because the leaders were different is because I was doing I was making wrong assessments. So.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:58.000 All right, get his bird through blood and fire at get his bird. By the way, yeah, I'm feeling sorry for anyone that that doesn't get this book. I'm obviously only reading chunks of it, but it's awesome.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:11.000 Here we go. In a moment, the whole core was marching was in marching order. Rest rations earth itself forgotten one thought to be first on that get his bird road.
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:22.000 The iron faced veterans were transformed to boys. They insisted on starting out with the colors flying so that even the night might know what manner of men were coming to redeem the day.
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:30.000 This is as these guys are getting more get his bird. I kind of had to had to talk about that.
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:40.000 There's a race to little round top and again, there's more detail about the whole battle and look.
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:52.000 We would have to read the whole book to really paint the picture of what's going on. So I don't want to get into the game or the I don't think I'm skilled enough as a human to convey the whole battlefield is unfolded.
00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:03.000 And so, if you go watch like a 20 minute video or a seven minute video on get his bird and understand the scheme maneuver you'll be able to put some of the stuff in context.
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:19.000 But here we go. This is the race to little round top. In another instant, a staff officer from general worn rushed up to find psychs are core commander to beg him to send a brigade at least to seize little round top before the enemy's surging waves could should overwhelm it.
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:41.000 Other supplications were in the air calling for aid everywhere are Vincent soldierly and self-reliant hearing this and treaty for round top waited word from no superior but taking the responsibility ordered us to turn and push for round top at all possible speed and dash ahead to study how best to place us.
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:47.000 So there's some decentralized command happening. He like, here's hey, we got to take this and cool. I got it.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.000 And then goes up ahead to see, all right, once we get up there, I'm going to put the people in the right position.
00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:02.000 We broke to that right and rear found a rude log bridge over plumb run and a rough farm road leading to the base of the mountain.
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000 Here, as we could, we took to the double quick. So these guys run.
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:25.000 Run to this position. So a little round top is a hill. It's on the left flank of the union, which has pretty much taken this ridge line to to stand and fight against the Confederate forces.
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:42.000 So we're going to pass forward a little bit as we near the summit of the mountain, the shot raped the crest that we had kept our men below to save our heads. Although this did not wholly overt the visits of treetops and splinters of rock and iron while the boulders and cliffs and pitfalls in our path.
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:58.000 Made them seem like the replica of the evil den across the sweetly named plumb run. And when you go to, when you go to Gettysburg, you can see this area that they call the devil's den. It's just a crazy outcroppings of rocks and trees.
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:12.000 It's like the craziest. It looks like a paintball battle field like setup. If you've been to Disneyland, that Tom Sawyer Island where they're all the boulders and they're just full of caves.
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000 That's what it is.
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:30.000 These guys are up above that reaching the southern face of little roundtop, I found Vincent there with an intense poison look. He said with a voice of awe as if translating the tables of the eternal law.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:48.000 I place you here. This is the left of the union line. You understand, you are to hold this ground at all costs. I did understand a full well, but had more to learn about costs.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:51:05.000 The regiment coming up right in front was put in a position by quite an uncommon order. On the right by file into line, both that we should thus be facing the enemy when we came to a front and also be ready to commence firing as fast as each man arrived.
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:32.000 This is a rather slow style of formation, but this time it was needful, knowing that we had no support on the left. I dispatched a stalwart company under the level headed captain Morelle in that direction with orders to move along up the valley of our front and left between us and the eastern base of the great roundtop to keep within supporting distance of us and act as exyncies of the battle should require.
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000 So these guys are getting in position as basically as fast as they can sounds like a like a peel into position kind of.
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:50.000 Yeah. Yeah, and then the then pushing those guys out there across that little valley sketchy.
00:51:50.000 --> 00:52:03.000 Yeah, but I think that they must have been there must have been less trees there and they they had to have visual visual eyes on them. Yeah, they're definitely was it's not as wooded.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000 There's not as wooded as it is today.
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:29.000 So these guys are on so so Chamberlain and his men are on little roundtop and then their little roundtop goes down and then it goes back up on the other side and that's the other side is big roundtop and this guy cap and Morelle takes a small group of guys like a dozen guys are some runs into those per day and sharp shooters over there.
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:44.000 But the supporting distance you know for me supporting distance means that you can shoot you know we can help me with your guns and I can probably I can see you and hopefully I can yell to you.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:51.000 I don't know if you can yell over all this noise, but supporting distance that's a doctrinal term.
00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:04.000 So like the essence of cover move by the way because hey if you go out there by yourself and you go too far away well now you're not going to help us and you're not going to you're going to not going to get help from us either.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.000 And they had to have that line up what we call line up some unications on where they could at least see somebody.
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:20.000 Yeah, and these guys probably had some pretty good hand and arm signals I would think to be able to communicate I mean even we have pretty freaking good hand and arm signals.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:36.000 Here we go the 20th main regiment had 358 men equipped for duty in the ranks with 28 officers they were all well seasoned soldiers and what is more well rounded men body and brain.
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:50.000 One sub-mort important side note must have place here in order properly to appreciate the mental and moral attitude of the men before us 120 of these men from the second main were recruits.
00:53:50.000 --> 00:54:06.000 Some recruiting officer had led into the belief that they should be discharged with their regiment at the end of its term of service. In their enthusiasm they had not noticed that they were signing enlistment papers for quote three years of the war end quote.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:21.000 They had been held in the field after the discharge of the regiment they had refused to do military duty and had been sequestered in a prisoner's camp as mutant years awaiting court martial. So he's got 120 guys that it signed up.
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:39.000 They thought they were just going to work with a 13th main well the 13th main stands down they fight a bunch of battles with them to fight a bunch of battles but then it stands down and then they go hey we're cool that regiments to down we're going home and I don't know you signed up for three years.
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:54.000 They're going to work with that regimen yeah then that regimen ston yeah but you signed up for three years. So these guys are pissed on principle by the way even in ancient times guess what them recruiters were out there doing.
00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:10.000 More than Vax. And the recruiters even back in the day the recruiters were lying to these fools get them in there so these guys are pissed their vaxed and.
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:29.000 They're waiting core martial and he's and so here we go the ex agency ex agency of our movement. The last of may had not permitted this semi civil treatment and orders from the secretary of war had directed me to make these take these man upon my rolls and put them to duty.
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:57.000 This made it harder for them to accept as they had never enlisted in this regimen however they had been soon brought over to me under another guard of the 108th Pennsylvania 118th Pennsylvania with fixed bayonets with orders to me to take them into my regimen and quote make them do duty or shoot them down the moment they refuse.
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:11.000 The guards bring these guys over at point of bayonet and say hey you got these guys not my problem anymore this is like the shitty team guys is like hey Jason I got a guy for your platoon you a lot of.
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:40.000 And then I told them hey take these guys make them do duty or shoot them. These had been the very words of the core commander in person the responsibility I thought gave me some discretionary power so I placed their names on our rolls distributed them by groups to equalize companies and particularly to break up the agreed core of banded mutiners so that's a brilliant move he takes him and says okay you three guys are going on this platoon you four guys are going this platoon you break some up.
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:56.000 Then I then I had called them together and pointed out to them the situation that they could not be entertained as civilian guests by me that they were by authority of the United States on my rolls of soldiers and I should treat them as soldiers should be treated.
00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:15.000 But they should lose no rights by obeying orders and I would see what could be done for their claim. It is pleasant to record that all but one or two had gone back. Manfully to duty to become some of the best soldiers in the regiment as I was to prove this very day so he treated them with respect.
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:28.000 He talked to him said listen I understand you got some claims. I get it, but hey if you act like a soldier I'll have you get my back right now and I'm gonna have your back and all but I guess two.
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000 Stood up and incredible.
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000 Yeah.
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:43.000 That's leadership. By the way the other leader who attacks them and disparages them has to guide them at bayonet.
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:54.000 This is the thing I get all the time you know that I always have to bring up the Vietnam drafties and just how you know some people when people tell me about whatever group they're working with.
00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:07.000 It's the millennials it's the union it's the the craft people it's the it's the nurses it's the dot you take all these groups of people whoever they are whatever business we're working with.
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:19.000 And they're like well the thing is with the nurses the thing is with the millennials they vacuum in these groups that know this is the worst group of people ever right.
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000 Because they don't want to listen or they think they deserve this they think they deserve that.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:42.000 And I was just I my go to is like I think the hardest group of human beings in the history to deal with was the Vietnam drafties because the Vietnam drafties didn't want to be there they didn't believe in the war and they could die doing their job.
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000 Yeah I'm running through my head right now.
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:56.000 Guys are drafted more more tuned other wars they were drafted but none of them were as.
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000 Unpopular as the Vietnam and it was you know it's debatable whether the Vietnam war was an existential threat so that that like is.
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:17.000 And then you've got to do it on top of the top of the off with the massive drug problem and all the other issues that were coming to a head inside the ranks and then you've got to deal with that.
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:38.000 Yeah it's any group at I you know nurses teachers you name the group and there's some leader not all leaders but there's a bad leader out there that says well you know the thing is with our soft one engineers is they think they deserve this they say about every single group.
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:50.000 You know the thing with millennials they they think or you know the this this gen X folks they think they built all this so they think everybody says that's about everyone so here's the deal.
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000 If you're a good leader in Vietnam and you had drafties which you did.
00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:09.000 You the good leaders love the drafties and they had no issue hack words one of them.
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:29.000 And then you know the people who are not going to be able to have someone telling me screwed up and go okay well let me see if I am screwed up or instead of just going on.
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:42.000 Treat people with respect listen to what they have to say. Take their input have their back and you can take guys that are prisoners and turn them into soldiers that are about to fight and sacrifice.
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:58.000 In the matter of a dozen hours because you got these guys like 12 hours before getting to get his burger maybe a little bit longer but it's it's a quick turnaround time not talking about months where he's serenading these prisoners trying to get him the chains are mine.
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:09.000 You know all this amazing is imagine this you're about to go into combat and up comes the 118th Pennsylvania goes a bro not my problem anymore this year problem now.
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:23.000 There's a lot of people that say yeah what do you give me I'm not taking these guys or yay put them over there lock them to a tree right what I'm not dealing with this right now and said he goes okay this is what I got cool I'm going to work with it what a what an awesome attitude.
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:37.000 I know I was I was I would we that I definitely took people in pletoons or in a train trade at where's I hey we got this issue cool 100 me let me let me let me work with his dude let me let me figure out what's going on.
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000 Instead of you know I want to.
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000 Hey man let's figure out what's going on with this guy chances are he's probably a halfway decent dude that just has some issues going on.
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:54.000 I'll be going through a divorce maybe done six back to back to points. I don't know what's going on, but you don't either when I ask you these questions you didn't even know what's happening with him.
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000 You're just telling me he's got a bad attitude why is it about attitude.
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000 Like let give him to me given to me.
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000 I put him in charge of cleaning the head.
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000 Right that's another example from strategy and tactics we'll put him in charge of something.
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000 Yeah, we did he still has a bad attitude.
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000 What was it.
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000 Well cleaning the head cleaning the bathrooms on the second back.
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000 No.
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000 Got him run a dive.
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000 Yeah.
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000 All right.
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000 So here we go.
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:34.000 I released the prisoners and provost guards all together and sent them to the companies all but the drummer boys and hospital attendance went into the ranks.
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000 Even the cooks and servants not liable for such service asked to go in.
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:48.000 Others whom I knew to be sick or foot sore and had given a pass to fall out on the forced marches of the day and night before came up.
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:57.000 Now that the battle was on dragging themselves along on lame and bleeding feet finding their regimen.
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:04.000 And their places where need is greatest and hearts true is.
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000 Think of that for a second.
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000 Like you just pointed out these guys didn't even have shoes that were fitted for left foot or right foot.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000 And they're dragging themselves up to the meat grinder saying put me in coach.
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000 Yeah.
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000 I'm bleeding feet.
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000 I forget what the forced road march was to get here but it was long.
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000 It was no joke.
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000 These guys are hurting when they show up.
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000 It's hot.
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000 It was you know.
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000 It's July.
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000 July.
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000 There in wool uniforms.
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000 It'd be great.
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000 The enemy had already turned the third corn left.
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000 The devil's den was a smoking crater.
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000 The plum run.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000 Gorge was a whirling maelstrom.
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000 One force was charging our advanced batteries near the wheat field.
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000 The flanking force was pressing past the base of the round tops all rolling towards us into
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000 Multuous waves.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000 It was a stirring not to say a palling site.
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:03.000 Here a whole battery of shot and shell cutting a ragged chasm through the seared mass.
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000 Flinging men in horses like drift aside.
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000 There a rifle volley at close range with reeling shock.
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000 Hands tossed in the air.
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000 Muskets dropped with death's quick relax or clutched with the last.
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000 Conversive energy.
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000 Men falling like grass before the scythe.
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000 Others with manhood's proud calm and rally.
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000 There a neat little group kneeling above some favorite officer slain.
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000 His intense spirit still animating the fiery steed.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000 The rising headlong with our empty saddle to the van.
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000 Here a defiant regiment of ours broken, slaughtered, captured, or survivors of both sides
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000 Crouching among the rocks for shelter from the terrible crossfire, where there was no rear.
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:56.000 But all advancing, all the frenzyed force, victors and vanguished, each scarcely knowing which
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:12.000 surging and foaming toward us, death around behind before and madness everywhere.
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000 It's a, it's, we haven't even gotten to like the real stress.
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000 So he's just showing up.
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000 Yeah.
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000 He's saying the picture that he's painting.
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000 Yeah.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000 So he's on little roundtop now.
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000 And this is what he's looking at.
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000 Just complete and utter chaos and mayhem.
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000 And that chaos and mayhem.
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000 Back to the book.
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000 It soon reached us still extending two brigades of Hood's division had attacked.
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000 Texas and Alabama.
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000 The fourth Alabama reached our right.
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:53.000 The 47th Alabama joined and crowded in, but gradually owing to their echelon advance.
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000 Soon seven companies of this regiment were in our front.
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000 We had all we could stand.
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000 My attention was sharply called now here now there in the thick and smoke lieutenant Nichols,
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000 a bright officer near our center ran up to tell me something queer was going on in his front.
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000 Behind those engaging us, I spring forward mounted a great rock in the midst of his company line.
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000 And was soon able to absolve the queer impression into positive knowledge.
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:32.000 Thick groups in gray were pushing up along the smooth daylby between the roundtops in a direction to gain our left flank.
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000 There was no mistaking this.
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.000 If they could hold our attention by a hot fight in front while they got in force on that flank,
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000 it would be bad for us and our whole defense.
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000 How many were coming we could not know. We were rather too busy to send out a reconnaissance.
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:58.000 If a strong force should gain our rear arborgade would be caught as bi-amighty sheer blade and cut and crushed.
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000 What would follow it would be easy to foresee.
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000 This must not be.
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000 Our orders to hold that ground had to be liberally interpreted.
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000 That front had to be held that rear covered.
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000 Something must be done quickly and coolly.
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:25.000 I called the captains and told them my tactics to keep the front fire at the hottest without special regard to its need or immediate effect.
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000 And at the same time as they found opportunity to take side steps to the left,
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000 coming gradually into one rank, file closers and all.
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.000 Then I took the colors with their guard and placed them at our extreme left where a great bolder gave token and support.
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:49.000 Then it's bending back at a right angle, the whole body gained ground leftward and made twice our original front.
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000 We were not long in doing it.
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000 This was a difficult movement to execute under fire requiring coolness as well as heat.
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:08.000 Of rare quality where my officers and men I shall never cease to admire and honor them for what they did in this desperate crisis.
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:18.000 So he had been told to hold specific ground and not give it up.
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000 And he says, what do you say?
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000 Take this liberally.
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.000 He had to adjust it because he understood the intent was to make sure that little roundtop got held.
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000 Not just the front but little roundtop as a whole.
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:40.000 So he had to adjust from just facing one direction to where he's got troops that are facing not just in front of him,
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000 but also to his left flank and then a little bit behind him because he saw that the confederates were making a move.
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000 Trying to flank.
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:56.000 Meantime the tremendous blow of the fourth and fifth Texas struck the right of our brigade.
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:04.000 And our 16th Michigan Reelden staggered back under the shock confusion followed.
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000 Vincent felt that all was lost unless the very God should intervene.
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:19.000 Sort of loft and face a flame he rushed in among the broken companies and desperate effort to rally them man by man.
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000 By sheer force of his superb personality he restored a portion of his line and was urging up the rest.
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000 Don't yield an inch now men or all his lost.
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:41.000 He cried when an answering volley scorched the very faces of the men and Vincent's soul went up in a cherry to fire.
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:52.000 That agonizing moment came tearing up the 140th New York Gallant O'Rourke at the head not waiting to load a musket or form a line.
01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:07.000 They sprang forward into that turmoil met by a withering volley that killed its fine young Colonel and laid low many of his intrepid officers and a hundred of his men this splendid regimen as by a providence.
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000 We may well call divine saved us all in that moment of threatened doom.
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:30.000 To add a tragic splendor to this dark scene in the midst of it all the indomitable haslet was trying to get his guns ten pounder rifleed parrots up to a working place on a small summit close beyond.
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:43.000 Finally he was obliged to take his horses entirely off and lift his guns by hand and handspeik up the craggy steep when he launched death and defiance wide and far around.
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:51.000 The roar of all this tumult reached us meanwhile on the left and heightened the intensity of our resolve.
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:59.000 Meanwhile the flanking column worked around to our left and was joined with those before us in a fiercest soul which lasted with increasing fury.
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000 For an intense hour.
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:11.000 The two lines met and broke and mingled in the shock the crush of muskertree gave way to cuts and thrusts grappling and wrestling.
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000 The edge of the conflict swayed to and fro with wild world pools and eddies.
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000 At times I saw around me more of the enemy than of my own men.
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:33.000 Gaps opening swallowing, closing again with sharp, convulsive energy squads of stalwart men who had cut their way through us disappearing as if translated.
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:50.000 All around strange, mingled roar, shouts of defiance rally and desperation and underneath murmured entry and stifled mones, gasping prayers, snatches of Sabbath song, whispers of love names everywhere.
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:59.000 The men torn and broken staggering creeping quivering on the earth and dead faces with strangely fixed eyes staring stark into the sky.
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:06.000 Things which cannot be told nor dreamed.
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000 How men held on each one nose, not eye.
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000 But manhood commands admiration.
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:25.000 One fine young fellow who had been cut down early in the fight with a ghastly wound across his forehead and who I thought might possibly be saved with prompt attention.
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:33.000 So I sent him back to our little field hospital at least to die in peace within a half an hour.
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:44.000 In a desperate rally I saw that noble youth amidst the rolling smoke as an apparition from the dead with bloody bandage for the only covering of his head in the thick of the fight.
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:51.000 Highborn and pressing on that they shall see death no more.
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:08.000 So you've got this just incredibly intense assault on this hill.
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:15.000 You've got the hill just about to be overrun when this guy Vincent Strong Vincent.
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:24.000 Rally's his troops and holds the line and then dies and then as right as the lines about to get broken again.
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:33.000 O'erork from the 140th New York brings his troops up same things able to hold the line.
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000 They don't even get a chance to load their muskets.
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.000 They just dive into the fight.
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:57.000 Continues on when that mad carnival load from some strange instinct in human nature and without any reason in the situation that can be seen when the battling edges drew a sunder their stood our little line.
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:08.000 The gaps not like sautheath but sharp as steel tempered in infernal heats like a magic sword of the Goths.
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000 We were on the appointed and entrusted line.
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000 We had held the ground at all costs.
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000 But now that the smoke dissolved we saw dead and wounded all out in front of us mingled with more of the enemy.
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:29.000 They were scattered all the way down to the very feet of the baffled hostile line now rallying in low shrubbery for a new onset.
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000 We could not wait for this.
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000 They knew our weakness now and they were gathering force.
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000 No place for tactics now the appeal to must be to primal instincts of human nature.
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000 So they go through this they hold the line barely.
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:54.000 And as the smart smoke begins to clear they're looking at over the field down the hill and they see all their wounded a bunch of enemy wounded and dead.
01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:07.000 And then they see the enemy starting to gather and muster for yet another attack.
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:15.000 Continuing on first it was to gather our wounded this is the human instinct you saw him.
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000 First it was to gather our human our wounded and bear them to the sheltered law and for saving life or peace in dying.
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000 The dead too that not even our feet should do them dishonor in the coming encounter.
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:34.000 Then such is heavenly human pity the wounded of our country's foes brothers in blood for us now.
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:43.000 So far from other caring born like refuge in soccer by the drummer boys who become angels of the field.
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:51.000 So they go out and start trying to help their dead their wounded and then the confederate soldier wounded.
01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:00.000 In this low I took a turn over the dismal field to see what could be done for the living in ranks or were coming and came upon a manly form and face I well remembered.
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:17.000 He was a sergeant earlier in the field of antitem and a Frederickburg and for refusing to perform some menial personal service for a bullying quartermaster and winner camp was reduced to the ranks by a commander who had not carefully investigated the case.
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:24.000 It was a degradation and the injustice of it wrinkled in his high-born spirit.
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:34.000 But his well-bred pride would not allow him to ask for justice as a favor. I kept this in mind for early action.
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:44.000 Now he was lying there stretched on an open front. So what he just said is he's got this guy that he remembers that fought well at antitem and fraught a Frederick Frederick's burden.
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:53.000 He was probably just a freaking BTF Tony type dude that was just a freaking badass and somebody told him to do some dumb shit.
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000 I'm not doing that.
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000 And he gets reduced in rank.
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:07.000 Now he was lying there stretched out an open front where a brave stand had been made face to the sky.
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:14.000 A great bullet hole in the middle of his breast from which he had loosened his closing, clothing to ease the breathing.
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000 And the rich blood was pouring in a stream. I bent down over him.
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000 His face lightened his lips moved.
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.000 I spoke first. My dear boy, it's gone hard for you. You shall be cared for.
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000 He whispered, tell my mother I did not die a coward.
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000 It was the prayer of home bread manhood poured out with his life blood.
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000 I knew and answered him. You die a sergeant.
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:50.000 I promote you for your faithful service and noble courage on the field of Gettysburg.
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:58.000 This was all he wanted.
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000 No word more.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:09.000 I had him born from the field, but his high spirit had passed to its place.
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.000 He doesn't need list to add that as soon as a piece of parchment could be found after that battle.
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:24.000 The warne was made out promoting George Washington buck to sergeant.
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:36.000 The silence and the doubt of the momentary low were quickly dispeled.
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000 So all that took place while there was a low in the fire.
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.000 The 47th Alabama had rallied to our right.
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:52.000 We were enveloped in fire and sure to be overwhelmed in fact when the great surge struck us.
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000 Already I could see the bold flankers on their right,
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000 darting out and creeping cat-like under the smoke to gain our left,
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000 thrown back as it was.
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000 It was for us then once for all.
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.000 Our thin line was broken and the enemy were in the rear of the whole round-top defense.
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000 Infantry artillery humanity itself with the round-top and the day theirs.
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000 Now two are fire was slackening.
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000 Our last rounds of shot had been fired.
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000 What I had sent for could not get to us.
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000 I saw the faces of my men one after the other.
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000 When they had fired their last cartridge, turn anxiously toward mine for a moment.
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000 Then square to the front again.
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.000 Through the front for them laid death to the rear what they would die to save.
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000 My thought was running deep.
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.000 I was combining the elements of a four-learn hope and it just communicated this to Captain Spear when a
01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000 Captain Spear of the Wheeling flank on which the initiative was to fall.
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:09.000 Just then, brave, warm-hearted, lieutenant-milcher of the color company who's Captain and nearly half of his men were down.
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:16.000 Came up and asked if he might take his company and go forward to pick up one or two of his men left wounded on the field
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000 and bring them in before the enemy got to near.
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000 This would be a most hazardous move in itself.
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000 And in this desperate moment, we could not break the line.
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.000 But I admired him with a glance he understood. I answered yes or in a moment.
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000 I am about to order a charge.
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000 So they're almost out of bullets.
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000 That's a freaking crazy thought.
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:49.000 As you're in command and as guys run out of bullets, they look at you like, I'm out.
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000 And then they look back to the front.
01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:07.000 And this kid comes up saying, hey boss, can I go out there and recover some of my wounded guys before the enemy gets too close?
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:13.000 And he knows he can't give that order, but he says, well, in a moment.
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000 Not a moment was about to be lost.
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000 Five minutes more of such defensive and the last role call would sound for us.
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:25.000 Despares the chances were there was nothing for it, but to take the offensive.
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000 I stepped to the colors.
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000 The men turned toward me.
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000 One word was enough.
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000 Bay and net.
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000 It caught like fire and swept along the ranks.
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000 The men took it up with a shout.
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000 One could not say whether it was from the pit or the song of the morning star.
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000 It was vain to order forward.
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:51.000 No mortal could have heard it in the mighty Halsana that was winging the sky.
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000 Nor would he wait to hear it.
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000 There are things still of the first creation who seed is in itself.
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.000 The grading clash of steel and fixing bay and net's told its own story.
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000 The color rose in front.
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000 The whole line quivered for the start.
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.000 The edge of the left wing rippled swung tossed among the rocks straightened.
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:22.000 Changed curve from Cimitar to Sickleshape and down the bristling arches swooped down upon the
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.000 Seared host down into the face of half a thousand.
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000 200 men.
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:37.000 So it's about a thousand or sorry it's about 500 people against 200.
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000 And all he had to say was bay and net.
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000 That imagery is just incredible.
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000 It's description of it.
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000 More a letteration.
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000 It's just in saying.
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000 He says it was a great right wheel.
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000 Our left swung first.
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000 The advancing foe stopped tried to make a stand amidst the trees and boulders.
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.000 But the frenzy bay and net's pressing through every space forced a constant settling to the
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000 rear.
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000 Moral.
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.000 Moral with his detached company and the remnants of our valorous sharp shooters who had held the
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000 enemy so long and check on the slopes of the great roundtop.
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000 Now fell upon the flank of the retiring crowd and it turned into full retreat.
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000 Some omits the crags of the great roundtop.
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000 So that's lucky.
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000 As the Confederate soldiers are starting to fall back.
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000 Now they're now who's on their flank.
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000 But Moral and the guys that are going up on the on the big roundtop.
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000 At the first dash the commanding officer I happened to confront.
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000 So this is as this is going down.
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:48.000 At the first dash the commanding officer I happened to confront coming on fiercely sword in one hand and big
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:54.000 Navy revolver on the other fires one barrel almost in my face.
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000 But seeing the quick saber point at his throat.
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:04.000 Reverse his arms give sword and pistol into my hands and yields himself a prisoner.
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000 I took him at his word but could not give him further attention.
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000 I passed him over to the custom custody of a brave sergeant at my side to whom I gave the sword
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000 as an emblem of his authority.
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:20.000 But kept the pistol with its loaded barrels which I thought might come in handy soon as indeed
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000 it did.
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:28.000 Ranks were broken, many retired before us somewhat hastily, some through their muskets to the ground, even loaded,
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000 sunk on their knees through up their hands calling out we surrender don't kill us.
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000 As if we wanted to do that we kill only to resist killing.
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:45.000 And these were manly men whom we could be friend and by no means kill if they came our way and peace and good will.
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000 Charging right through and over these we struck the second line to the 47th Alabama doing their best to stand but offering
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000 little resistance.
01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:01.000 The lieutenant Colonel as I passed and a fine gentleman was the lieutenant boulder introduced himself as my prisoner.
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000 And as he was wounded I had him cared for as best we could.
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:14.000 Still swinging to the right as the great gate on its hinges we swept the front clean of a salence.
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.000 So that's it.
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:28.000 I mean that's the that's the famous charge bayonet charge from little roundtop down little roundtop.
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000 And in those guys from the Alabama.
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.000 Have been running all day in.
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:50.000 They were out of water they had net water and hours they had a couple of guys trying to go and try and find water and they got run up and they're just just it's it's an incredible.
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:58.000 Clash and the way chamberlin talks about this and he talks about that we could be friends with these guys.
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000 If we weren't fighting any keep said in his mind it's something that.
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:11.000 I was able to do on the battlefield. I had a little bit of hatred in my heart when I went to war but this guy.
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000 He's at peace.
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000 The whole time and I think that's what what makes him such.
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000 That is what makes him such an incredible leader and person.
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000 Yeah to go through that to lose all all these guys.
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000 And still as soon as these guys surrender be like yep okay.
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000 I'll treat you fair enough.
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:40.000 I mean I think that's definitely easier when it's you know you're fighting America other Americans.
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:56.000 I mean I guess they were confederates but you know you have they guys had so much in common with you know when we when we fight all of a sudden we're fighting against a person with a different language person with a different culture person from a different country.
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:03.000 It's a slipper flow it's way easier.
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:19.000 Which is not the best way to do it because when the next thing that the next step that you're on when you go down there is to lose respect for the enemy and then you get complacent and that complacency always comes back to bite you.
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:29.000 This is going forward a little bit. He has to get them to stop because they're charging and there's that there's much he says.
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000 Too much motivation. He says it was no light task to get our men to stop.
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000 They were under the momentum of their deed.
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000 They thought they were on the road to Richmond.
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:48.000 They had to be reasoned with persuaded but at last faced about and marched back to that dedicated crest with swelling hearts.
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000 Not without sad interest and service was the return.
01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:05.000 For many of the wounded had to be gathered up. There was a burden to of the living nearly 400 prisoners remained in our hands two for every man of ours.
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:29.000 And nine o'clock the next morning we were with withdrawn being relieved by our first brigade. But we were sent to support anything but a place of rest. Our new position was in support of handcocks troops near the left center of the union line which proved to be the point aimed at by pickets charged that afternoon.
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:37.000 They kind of said hey look these guys just made a stand on a little round top and they lost a bunch of guys and we're going to give them a little breather.
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:45.000 So instead of putting them out on a flank again we're going to bring them right into the center of the union line where they're probably not you know probably not going to see any action.
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000 We should be okay.
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:55.000 And that ends up being the spot where pickets charged literally takes place.
01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:04.000 And unless I'm mistaken the guy that makes it the far from furthest from the Confederates was handcocks best man in his wedding.
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000 Yeah. Incredible.
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:14.000 Yeah they have that they have that monument the high water the high water mark of where the Confederacy made it to.
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.000 They have a thing this is where this guy made it to the furthest north.
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.000 He says it was certainly a narrow chance for us and for the round tops.
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:36.000 Had we not used up our ammunition and had we continued to meet the enemy musket to musket this give and take would have soon finished us by reason of the enemy superior numbers.
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000 That's an incredible debrief point.
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.000 So he's saying look if we have it I would have had enough ammunition and we would have just sat there and trade shots with them.
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:50.000 They had more people so eventually they would have they would have taken us they had what 500 people we had 200.
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000 We were just trade war of attrition we're going to lose violence of action right.
01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:00.000 He just deployed violence of action the college professor understood it and that's like.
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000 That's where we were always taught.
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000 Yeah.
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000 Day one and the seal teams.
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:04.000 Yeah.
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.000 There's a that's where we get taught we get taught speed surprise and violence of action.
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:15.000 There was a Vietnam vet that that had broken service obviously and he came back in the teams.
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:26.000 And did a platoon chief slot and man I think he he was almost 50 when he did a platoon chief slot and I remember.
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000 I was in the training cell where you're running an operation for him only had kind of a big target and they were set up.
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:40.000 And he was briefing his guys are doing a little sand table before they were getting ready I was integrating them they're getting ready to go hit the target and he goes.
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000 Boys.
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:52.000 There's a lot to be said for violence of action let's get online and mo this target down and they did it was brief and was so impressive.
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000 So good.
01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:11.000 He goes on with a little bit more debrief or had the 15th Alabama continued their onset not regarding our preposterous demonstrations they would have walked over our bodies to their victory.
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:21.000 Or still again if one more Confederate regiment had come up on our flank we must have been rolled into a zero figure and swallowed up in the development.
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000 It was a psychological success.
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:31.000 A miracle in the scheme of military science that's an interesting way to describe it a psychological success.
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.000 You you you definitely hear those that the bayonet is a psychological weapon.
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000 There you go.
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:51.000 Those brave Alabama fellows none braver or better in either army were victims of a surprise of their quick and mobile imagination.
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000 Damn.
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000 Like it got to him in that split second.
01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000 Yeah.
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000 Uh.
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:09.000 Continues on here we had gone up the roundtop slopes to bid farewell to our dead.
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:18.000 We found them there on the sheltered lawn where we had laid them on the velvet moss fringed by low seaters that veiled the place with peace and beauty.
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:27.000 I wrote up near and flinging the rain upon my horses neck dismounted to bend over them for soldiers farewell.
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000 There they lay side by side with touch of elbow still.
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000 Brave bronze faces where the where the last thought was written.
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:43.000 Manly resolution heroic self-giving divine reconciliation.
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:52.000 Or where on some young face the sweet mother look had come out under death's soft whisper.
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000 We buried them there in a grave a last.
01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:01.000 To ride on the sunny side of a great rock eternal witnesses of their worth.
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000 The rock and the sun.
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000 Rood headboards made of ammunition boxes.
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:23.000 Rood be carved under tear dim dyes marked a named each grave and told each home.
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.000 He goes on to say I thought of those other noble men of every type.
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.000 Commanders all who bore their wounds so bravely,
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:39.000 Men it amit their end on later fields and those whose true hearts further high trust were to be laid.
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:48.000 Nor did I forget those others whether their names are written on the scrolls of honor and fame or their dust left on some far field.
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:57.000 The nameless here, nameless never to me nor nameless I trust in God where they are tonight.
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:08.000 I sat there alone on the storied crest till the sun went down as it did over the misty hills and the darkness crept up the slopes till from all earthly sight.
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000 I was buried with those before.
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:21.000 But oh what radiant companionship rose around what steadfast ranks of power, what bearing of heroic souls.
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:29.000 Oh the glory that been through those nights and days, nobody will ever know it here.
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000 I am sorry most of all for that.
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000 The proud young valor that rose above the mortal,
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000 and then at last was mortal after all.
01:34:42.000 --> 01:35:02.000 So there's Gettysburg.
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:14.000 And what's crazy is you think that that's Gettysburg,
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:27.000 like epic heroic beyond mythical scenario that unfolded real time for this guy and for his troops.
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:39.000 And then what do they do? March because it's not over.
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000 Going forward now to Peter'sburg.
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000 And again, get this book to so much detail in here that I'm not covering.
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000 I will do an audio book.
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000 Just randomly check with echo Charles my editor over here.
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000 Gettysburg, you get to do a light main accent.
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000 Oh that'd be good, wouldn't it?
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000 Oh sure.
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000 Man you're right, I should have been doing a down east of this whole time.
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000 Would he have talked like that?
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000 No, I don't.
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000 It's hard to say.
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.000 It certainly doesn't seem like it.
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000 But you know he could have, you know.
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000 It's a very subtle.
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.000 It can be subtle.
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:25.000 It's just a little bit different.
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:32.000 So here we go to Peter'sburg because I don't know what else to tell you about Gettysburg other than
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:40.000 Go, if you get the chance to go there, go there and don't rush and take your time and you will have a spiritual experience.
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:46.000 That's what I'm going to tell you about about Gettysburg.
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:56.000 And by the way, that's one story because there's a little round top style battles that are just
01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:04.000 Maker breaking the future of our country.
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:13.000 Going back to the book went on the evening of June 17th under the sharp attack of our second and ninth core, the enemy drew in the outer line of their defenses.
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:25.000 They left on an outline crest near the deep cut of the Norfolk Rado Railroad and advanced artillery post commanding the approaches from our side to the fortifications at Reeves, salient.
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:36.000 From this position early on the 18th, they opened a strong, slant fire on our division, then drawn up from a salt in our immediate front north of the railroad.
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:45.000 Our attack was thus delayed while our own batteries were getting into position to support this assault. So we're going into an assault.
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:52.000 Our line, however, was held in place, perhaps to take the enemy's attention from the movement of our guns cover move is happening.
01:37:52.000 --> 01:38:00.000 This raking fire along our ranks was very trying to the nerves, which is a very mild way of saying things.
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:09.000 Freaking, breaking fire from cannons is trying to our nerves as well as to our judgment of the tactics which held us there.
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:16.000 When we were not allowed to move forward nor hit back, I am not saying to get back.
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:27.000 So he's not saying he wanted to leave. He said he wanted to fight, but he's getting told, no, no, hold it. He were getting, we're getting freaking raked with fire here. Just hold what you got.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:41.000 Our men were going down fast and for no good that we could see. It was therefore a welcome piece of information when our core commander came along with the euphemism statement that this was quote, very annoying and quote,
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:48.000 which remarked, prefaced the swath inquiry if I thought I could carry that position.
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:58.000 I understood the purport of the mild inquiry thought indeed was required, but the meeting was action. So let me translate that for you.
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:05.000 They're getting raked with fire. This commander comes up and says, this is annoying. He's like, yeah, no shit.
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000 And he says, do you think you could, you know, you could assault that position?
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:19.000 And the, the, what did he say? He understood that what that inquiry meant was like, hey, man, can you make this shit happen?
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000 And he knew that the meaning was action.
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:29.000 So he says, reconordering the situation, I could see no likelihood of being able to hold this place for long, nor in my judgment was it of importance to hold.
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:41.000 Now that the batteries were dislodged, which had annoyed our troops in the design to solve, more over I discovered that the position was completely commanded by the enemies main works at the salient.
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:50.000 Three or four hundred yards in our front were plainly seen several strong earth works with 12 or 15 guns so disposed,
01:39:50.000 --> 01:40:09.000 I do as to deliver a smashing crossfire over the ground between us, and just across the plank road was a large fork with heavy guns ready to sweep the cross, we were occupying between these works was a solid entrenched infantry line of at least 3000 men.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:37.000 We were a mile away from the rest of the army and I prepared to quote, take care of myself, I hurried up three batteries and trusted to me running up the guns up under the cover of the crest leveling slight platforms on the hit their slope so that the men could work their guns taking advantage of their recoil at discharge to reload and then easily run them up again the mussels lying in the grass, all as yet unperceived by the enemy and made them ready for what might happen.
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:46.000 This position would be of use in case of a general assault by our army and this is what I look for.
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.000 They're in a freaking hard situation. I mean that's what this is spelling out.
01:40:50.000 --> 01:41:00.000 At this juncture, what was my astonishment at receiving a verbal order through a staff officer personally unknown to me, directing me in the name of.
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:08.000 The general commanding end quote to assault the enemy's main works in my front with my brigade.
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:16.000 So the reason I kind of had to set up some of that military stuff there was because of what's about to happen.
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:27.000 So he's standing there. He sees this is like a really tough situation. There's 3000 people. They got flanking guns. They're going to be in a bad way and this freaking random guy that he's never seen before says,
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000 Hey, the general commanding says assault.
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:40.000 Assault frontal assault. He says this. This was certainly a compliment to my six splendid regiments.
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:52.000 But I think you will justify my astonishment as well as my backhanded courage and recklessness of personal consequences in presuming to send back to the general a written statement of the situation.
01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:02.000 With the opinion that that position could not be carried with a single brigade even of Gettysburg veterans. So he sends back to the general. Hey, bro.
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:10.000 No, that doesn't sound like a good idea. Like be by myself with my regiments. It's not going to make this happen.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:25.000 Grant, General Grant had lost all patients that morning and his chief subordinates were excited and flurry to in a man ride not see before. I, however, received a courteous answer.
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000 Saying that the whole army would join in on my right.
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.000 But the single brigade was to make the assault and prove the prophecy.
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:45.000 And the prophecy here is that grants not listening. So he gives push back and says, Hey, I'm telling you, this isn't going to work.
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:53.000 And this is another thing we saw at Gettysburg where long street was saying, Hey, we don't want to assault the union line right here.
01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:00.000 It's not a good call in general. He's like, no, we're doing it. Oh, no, it was he was trying to set up the flanking maneuver. Generally wasn't listening.
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:10.000 He was going to push back twice. Yeah, push back twice grants the same thing here. You got, you got freaking Chamberlain saying, Hey, bro, I wrote you a note.
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:16.000 I don't think we could take this with a single brigade, even if Gettysburg veterans.
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:24.000 Grant had lost all patients that morning and his chief subordinates were excited and flurry to in a man ride not see before.
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:36.000 And as always, I wonder if that's his funny to people that don't understand what a staff officer's liking the military and how they freak out when the senior leadership says, We need to make this happen. How are you going to make this happen?
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:42.000 It gets worse too. Every level that it's harder down. It's magnified.
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000 Yep. And less listening and more telling.
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:58.000 So he says in such an assault, Muscatree was not to be thought of. It must be a storm of cannane, a rush of infantry with pieces at the shoulder.
01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:06.000 Over the works and ban at the enemy at their guns. It was desperate deadly business. The bugler sounded the charge.
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:15.000 Under that storm of fire, the earth flew into the air. Men went down like skyds swept green. A wall of smoke veiled the front.
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:22.000 I thought it necessary to lead the charge with full staff following. But in 10 minutes, not a man was left mounted.
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:31.000 My staff were scattered. My flag bear shot dead. My own horse down. To cheer and guide the men where no voice could be heard.
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:39.000 I picked up the flag and bore it a loft till close upon the enemy's works. And many ball cut me through.
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.000 And the red cross came down to the red and riddled earth.
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:51.000 So the red cross is their symbol. And they call it colors a lot.
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:58.000 But this is the flag of these various unions. Sometimes they're talking about the American flag. Sometimes they talk about the Confederate flags,
01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:07.000 the same thing. But this multi's cross looks like an iron cross kind of that's there. That's what they have at the 20th main.
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:19.000 And it's important to note that these flags, they were very representative of like the pride and honor of the unit.
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:24.000 But beyond that, they were like a signaling device.
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:31.000 It's communication that like, hey, here's where we're at. We are going forward. So if the flag goes down, it's a signal that we're not going forward.
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:40.000 If the flag is up and going forward, it's a signal that we're going forward. If you take the enemies flag, it's a signal to the enemy that you get just got your ass handed to you.
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:48.000 And now we're winning. So that flag is is much more kind of a, it's not just symbolic, I should say.
01:45:48.000 --> 01:46:01.000 It's hugely symbolic and it's function. It's totally functional. So when they talk about these scenes and there's plenty of scenes where you can see the colors, the flags come into play. This is one of them.
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:13.000 He sees that he can't even pass any word. There's no word to pass. No one can hear him. There's too much noise, too much chaos. So he personally runs grabs the flag and charges forward.
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:29.000 And then he gets cut. Then he gets shot. He says, I saw my man rush past me to the very muscles of the gun, then torn in pieces and trickling back the enemy rushing out beyond our left to flank our batteries on the crest behind us.
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:37.000 I had only strength to send to broken regiments to support the batteries before I saw that all else was lost.
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:54.000 In the midst of this turmoil, I lay half buried by clods of turn up or earth for an hour. When the shrouding smoke lifting, I was born from the field by some of major bigalo's men of the ninth Massachusetts battery on the crest.
01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:11.000 When you picture that field air and earth cross cut with thick flying, hitting plunging, burying bursting missiles, you will not wonder that we did not succeed in bayonetting the enemy at their guns inside their works.
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:20.000 You will rather wonder that some of my men got near enough to fall within 20 feet of them.
01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:26.000 Bigalo's a beast too. He's another one that we talk about at Gettysburg.
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:35.000 It's incredible where he boggles my mind that he gets shot in the pelvis essentially.
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:41.000 And this is a civil war and he survives.
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:46.000 What do we know? He's going to be back out on the field fighting in like six months.
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:54.000 So what happens here? He has to leave the field because he severely wounded.
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.000 And at Petersburg it begins nine months of trench warfare. Basically of trench warfare.
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:05.000 They call it a siege but it's more like a prolonged battle.
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:13.000 There's 125,000 union soldiers around Petersburg. There's 60,000 confederates trying to hold it.
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:20.000 Between the two of them, they take about 50% casualties over this period.
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:29.000 You're starting to see some breakdown in the confederate side, like 25,000 confederate desertions.
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:36.000 So that's what's going on. Meanwhile, while that's happening, here's what's going on with Chamberlain.
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.000 And this is actually taken from a sort of a memorial.
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:49.000 It's like a ulogy or memorial. It's in memorial. It's an article basically.
01:48:49.000 --> 01:49:00.000 And it says, at Petersburg on the 18th of June, he led an attack on a strong position from which a heavy artillery fire was directed on his advance.
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:08.000 Now listen, before we just jump into this reminder, here you, this is just a classic case leadership situation.
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:18.000 You've got a trusted commander, proven leader, by the way, a metal of honor recipient that just freaking led the holding of the round tops,
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:24.000 what, maybe a year of prior. This guy is respected and they went to multiple battles in between.
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:30.000 So here he is, and he's saying, hey boss, I don't think this is a good idea.
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000 And you say shut up and go, and this is the result.
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.000 So when your subordinates are pushing back, don't think that you're right and they're wrong.
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:46.000 Maybe think that they're right and you're wrong. Is there a chance you're right? Maybe, but where's Grant? Where's Grant right now?
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:50.000 I don't know where he is. Probably in the rear somewhere with the gear.
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:55.000 He, no, he's in the rear with the gear. I'm out here on the front line. I'm observing the enemy positions.
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:59.000 I can see how they're laid up. I understand the terrain way better than Grant does.
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.000 And now he's telling me, now, you know what, you shut up in charge. Don't worry, the army's going to have your back.
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000 Bro, no! Let's not do that.
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:17.000 By the way, if there was some reason, and I can articulate, if I say, hey Jason, I want you to assault this thing.
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000 You go, hey boss doesn't look like a good idea. And I say, hey, the reason I'm having you assault that is because as you assault that,
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000 we're actually sending some troops over here to this other position, and that's our main objective.
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.000 And you go, got it. If you can articulate that, okay?
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:37.000 But if you can't even articulate a reason other than, hey, shut up and do it. I told you, that's probably not a good indication.
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:48.000 If you're best to defense in an argument, is to say shut up and do it. I told you, that's probably an indication that you don't have a good argument because you're probably wrong.
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:58.000 So this is the kind of lessons that we can learn from a leader, and you know what? Chamberlain? Here's a discredit to Chamberlain.
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:04.000 Hey, I'm not going. Hey, well, I'm not doing this. It doesn't make any sense. I'm going to go talk to Grant. I'm leaving right now.
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000 Could he have pushed back harger? He sent one note.
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000 Could he have pushed back harger?
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:23.000 He thought that the army was actually coming in on the right. True. I mean, if he has a relationship with Grant and he's like, okay, I buy that that maybe they're coming in and he's got a bigger plan for me and it's probably why.
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:36.000 Yeah, and that seemed to gratify him that, okay, if you're going to hit them with the, you know, just like I just said to you, if like, hey, Jason, you knew something like, hey, but this is a good idea. And I say, yeah, but don't want to get your flank over here and we're going to run them up and you go, cool, got it.
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:52.000 Because now you know that you're going to have to commence the assault, make some progress, but then you're going to get relief very quickly and we're going to have the upper hand very quickly. So now you understand it and it makes sense. So yeah, maybe maybe that was the case.
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.000 What we can learn from that is there's a time to push back and there's a time to push back hard.
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:05.000 There's a time to maybe ask questions, ask her in his questions.
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:16.000 And either way, there's there, you're, you're losing, when you push back, there's a way to push back to that you're, because you're going to lose capital with the leadership capital with the person.
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:21.000 Yes. And, and if I tell you to shut up and do something, I'm losing a ton of leadership capital too and you have to realize that.
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:28.000 So two things are important. One is make sure that you're building up leadership capital with everybody around you so that you can actually
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:41.000 make with draws on that bank account because you've built it up. You know what's weird is I just kind of like left myself out in, in the air. I left my flank out. I said, there's a time to push back and there's a, and I was like, wait,
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:52.000 because to me, there's always a time to push back. There's, if you're telling me to do something stupid. Now look, if we're in a firefight and you look at me and you say, hey,
01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:02.000 hey, Jocco, getting that building over there, I'm going to do it unless I see something crazy. I'm going to do it. I'm not going to push back then because we're at the moment of truth, right?
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:16.000 Those moments are very rare. They're very, very rare. Where we, I have to just trust you. Now look, we built trust over time. So if you tell me to take that building, I know you're telling it to me for a good reason.
01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:27.000 So I guess there's a time to push back. I guess the other, the other part of that is there's a time to make sure you understand the bigger picture.
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:36.000 Because you either have to push back or you ask the question, say, wait a second, Jocco, why do you want me to assault that building? It doesn't make any sense.
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:44.000 And I say, here's why, because as you assault that building, we're going to come in and see other operations. It's going to keep the enemy distracted and then we're going to have the upper hand.
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:53.000 You go, okay, cool, got it. So there's a time to push back. There's a time to check yourself and make sure you understand the bigger picture yourself.
01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:00.000 And if there's no bigger picture, the bigger picture doesn't make sense, then maybe you have to say, look, I'm not doing this.
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:06.000 On the battlefield though, everybody's a chess piece.
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:17.000 And it may be that you're going to, your chess piece is getting taken and that's probably what he realizes. Okay. Well, he told me they're coming from the right. And this is lousy for us.
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000 But they're willing to make that sacrifice.
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000 It's really difficult to parse apart.
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:32.000 Yeah. It is difficult to parse apart. I mean, we could probably find more research and get more information behind the decision making process.
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:42.000 But the lesson is very clear. And look, you're right. There's times where especially in all out war like this. Hey, this chess piece just like in chess literally.
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:51.000 Sometimes you move the night and it gets taken by the bishop, but now the bishop is in a blocked position. So you made the good move. You sat.
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:59.000 There are times in battle where that happens. I mean, when you look at D day, some of those original people hitting the beaches,
01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:09.000 they were, they were in a huge situation to be sacrificed. That's what was about to happen. Look, were they suicide? No, not quite. But damn.
01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.000 That should be very rare. They're telling them to hold the, the left flank on the ground.
01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:23.000 That all has her. Yeah. But that needs no explanation, right? That needs no explanation. Hey, you didn't even need to ask why. Oh, this is where on the extra. That's what he Vincent says to him.
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:30.000 You're on the extreme left. Do you understand? He's like, yes, I understand. I know what that means. That means if I go, we, if I fall, we all fall.
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000 Yeah.
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:39.000 Um, but that pushback thing so important, such an important part of leadership, such an important part of leadership.
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:45.000 You know, the, the story I talk about in that economy of leadership, maybe it's a extreme ownership, but push, yeah, it was a dichotomy.
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:50.000 It's like pushing back when they, when my leadership told me you have to take this many hierarchies with you.
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:56.000 There's a ratio and I said, hey, that doesn't make sense. And my leadership said cool, Jockel, thank you for telling us.
01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:04.000 Because I articulated to them what the scenario was. And you hadn't been pushing, and that's what I was talking about with the leadership capital.
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000 You weren't pushing back all the time.
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:14.000 We need more rental cards with this next trip. Hey, you know, this, this or that, you're just like Roger that.
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.000 All the dumb stuff you're just knocking it out. Oh, yeah. We got to the administrative stuff cool.
01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:28.000 And we'll do it. And so the only, and this is the mistake people make with the push and back, is there pushing back all the time on stuff that doesn't matter.
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000 And then it undercuts them when it actually does matter.
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:40.000 I mean, you were in my freaking sister task unit. And so you saw me doing that kind of stuff like a Roger that. Yep, got it. Yep, we're going to go into it.
01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000 Lean it into it. Yeah. Well, we'll handle that. Yeah, no factor.
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:52.000 And that's how I was able to build up that leadership capital. Yes. So that when the push back mattered, I got listened to, which is important.
01:56:52.000 --> 01:57:01.000 Shocking that you got Chamberlain as your guy that's pushing back on you and you're like, don't worry about it.
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:10.000 So like I said, this, this battle where Peter's bird, it battle, Peter's bird where Joshua Chamberlain gets wounded.
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:17.000 It ends up in nine months of trench warfare. What's he doing there during that time going to this memorial piece that was written about him?
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:25.000 At Peter'sburg on the 18th of July, he led an attack on a strong position from which a heavy artillery fire was directed on his advance.
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.000 Many of his men were swept down in Chamberlain's horse was killed by a shell.
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:39.000 The attack was pushed with vigor and while leading it on foot, Chamberlain fell shot through by a ball, which passed through the body from hip to hip.
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000 He was covering arteries and fracturing bones.
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:52.000 He was carried from the field and taken to a hospital, a napolis, where for two months, he lay at the point of death.
01:57:52.000 --> 01:58:01.000 After the general had been taken to the field hospital, the regular surgeon in charge declared the case hopeless.
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:19.000 The man in A.O. Shaw, surgeon of the 20th main after an exhausting days labor, rode through the woods at night and finding the general remained with him, watching and caring for him and performing a surgical operation he found necessary until his patient seemed out of immediate danger.
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:28.000 His friends who were cognizant of the case have always felt General Chamberlain's life was saved by Dr. Shaw's skill and faithfulness.
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:37.000 In his last illness, Dr. Shaw attended his old chief with his same faithfulness he had shown in caring for him so many years before.
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:45.000 At the end of five months and before he could mount a horse or walk a hundred yards, Chamberlain resumed command of his brigade.
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:49.000 Before he was taken from the field, he was assured of his promotion.
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:54.000 After his arrival at a napolis, he received a telegram as follows.
01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:01.000 To Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, 20th main infantry, special order number 39 first.
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:18.000 Colonel J. L. Chamberlain, 20th main infantry volunteers from Maritorias and efficient services on the field of battle and especially for gaunt conduct in leading his brigade against the enemy at Petersburg on the 18th in which he was seriously wounded.
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:34.000 In pursuance of the authority of the Secretary of War is appointed Brigadier General of the U.S. volunteers to rank as such from the 18th day of June 1864 subject to the approval of the president that signed by Ulysses S. Grant.
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:40.000 This is the only instance in the war of promotion on the battlefield.
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:51.000 The terrible wound received on the 18th of June 1864 caused him suffering throughout his life and at intervals incapacitated him for work of any kind.
01:59:51.000 --> 02:00:02.000 Resuming his command under conditions that would have amply excused him from active service, he was at once employed in operations along the well than railroad road.
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:12.000 He was so severely affected by the hardships of duty and the inclimacy of the weather that at the end of the month his corps commander insisted on his going north for treatment.
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:18.000 While recuperating, he declined many offers of attractive positions in civil life.
02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:31.000 After a month in the care of surgeons, he stole away from them and leaving his room for the first time made the painful journey to the front and took command of a new brigade composed of New York and Pennsylvania regiments.
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:40.000 Bro, you folks from Maine, I am in awe at your tenacity and vigor.
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:48.000 It's freaking awesome. You know, we're approaching two hours deep right now.
02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:57.000 I'm thinking we break now and pick it up with another podcast.
02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:06.000 We'll be picking it up as he gets back. He gets back to the military operations on a white oak road.
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:12.000 So, well, so much stuff to talk about here.
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:20.000 Hey, look, if you're interested in this stuff, we do, we do this review of the battlefield, the battlefield review.
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:33.000 The next one that we're doing in Gettysburg is May 11th and 12th. You actually get there on the 10th or May 13th and 14th. That's at Gettysburg.
02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:44.000 We're there for two days. We basically do two iterations of it back to back. I could do a hundred iterations back to back of it.
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:54.000 And actually, after that, we're doing in August, August 16th and 17th and then August 18th and 19th, we're doing a little big horn,
02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:01.000 which we've covered on the podcast, that battle and some of the people up front. We should do another one.
02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:07.000 We'll do a podcast about about, to podcast about crazy horse.
02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:17.000 But if you want to come to those things, go to echelonfront.com. That's where we, that's where we, yeah, I look at events. That's what's up.
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000 Echo. Yes. Quiet today.
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000 It's taking it all in.
02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.000 It's an elevated, how hard is it to listen when I'm reading this stuff?
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:33.000 Well, it depends on what you mean by hard, but yeah, like you, I realized that even though I was like, oh, this guy's such a great writer,
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000 then I read it out loud and I'm kind of translating it a little bit.
02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000 Yes, you know, probably needed. Yes. Okay.
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:47.000 Yeah. So even even like you get even a guy nowadays, right? You know, you get these guys. They like to use big words on purpose, you know,
02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.000 to sound smart and whatever, whatever, whatever.
02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000 Even then you find your brain like, okay, he just said this and you're in,
02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:03.000 sure it's a form of translation. Essentially, that's kind of what it was like. Yeah. Actually, it was a lot of what it was like.
02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:10.000 Yeah, I felt like that. I, I was doing that and I was doing that naturally. I hadn't planned to do that at all.
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.000 And I probably should have prepared a little bit more to say, hey, here's what you're about to hear,
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.000 because that's the same thing that happens with, hey, to say it's speaking to try to sound smart.
02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.000 But like when you read Shakespeare, if you don't know what's happening and you just read it,
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.000 it's a different language. It's close to middle English. So it's kind of a different language.
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:35.000 And then once you know what it means and what those words mean and why their sentences are formatted a certain way,
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.000 you go, oh, wow, there's so much more meaning behind these things.
02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:45.000 And I think that's probably the case with this book. Obviously, not to the extent that Shakespeare is,
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:51.000 but to say, oh, what does that actually mean? And then read it again and listen to it again and say,
02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000 damn, that's an incredible piece of writing.
02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000 It's like jumping into a cold swimming pool.
02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:00.000 Yeah. It's a little bit weird for a little bit. And then you could use to it.
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.000 And you're like, oh, okay, I get it. This is this is good on,
02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:09.000 or getting used to like, Kormack McCarthy writing without any,
02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:14.000 any kind of situation marks. And it just takes you a second and then you could use to it.
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.000 The weird thing about Kormack McCarthy is his styles between books is so radically different.
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:25.000 I think the best example that being the road and then, and then blood meridian.
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000 Like when you read the road, that is a straightforward book.
02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:32.000 It's kind of what I lean towards in final spin.
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:32.000 Yeah.
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000 It's just like, don't put a screenplay.
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000 Yeah. And then, and I think he wrote the road.
02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.000 Yeah, I think he wrote it with some intention of screenplay.
02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:46.000 But then when you read blood meridian, you need a dictionary on hand.
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:55.000 Like unless you're a doctor, a botanist, a history professor,
02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:01.000 and you know, and a religious, you know, minister,
02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000 you're going to miss a bunch of stuff in there.
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.000 I mean, just the, oh, yeah, and also a geologist because we're rocks.
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:12.000 He's talking about and freaking, like you got to have a dictionary on standby.
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000 Yeah.
02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:20.000 I feel like I use less dictionary reading band-up forward than I used when I read blood meridian.
02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.000 No, I mean, you know, like it's words like salient and things like that.
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:29.000 That people aren't used to that you got to go look to thank goodness you can just pull it up on.
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.000 Yeah, I've got a dictionary app on my, on my phone.
02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.000 Or I'm gonna say, and it's very useful.
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000 But hey, if you want to come check some of the stuff out.
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.000 You know, we're covering one angle today, we're with Joshua Chamberlain.
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.000 We cover a bunch more angles on these events.
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000 So I can't want to come check that out at slobfront.com.
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:54.000 We got if you want to support us, while you support yourself, remember that old theme?

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.000 It's current.
02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000 Current, huh?
02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000 I think to have this opinion, you know, but yes, it is current in my opinion.
02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:07.000 So if you want to support the podcast, while you support yourself,
02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:11.000 we got a mutually aligned focus here.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:21.000 What's your latest and greatest, free game, milk creation?
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000 You still, you still thrown it in your morning coffee?
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:25.000 Little, what are you throwing there, vanilla?
02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.000 No, I'm cutting back on the milk in my morning coffee.
02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000 I'm just using it to just straight anymore.
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.000 Just straight, ma'am.
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000 Yeah.
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.000 It's so tasty.
02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000 Yeah.
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000 I've been mixing the banana and the peanut butter doing this Elvis thing.
02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000 I can't stop.
02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.000 I can't.
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:48.000 I feel like that's what kind of kill was one of the, you know, factors that led to Elvis's death, right?
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000 Because this, this dude was like,
02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000 It looked, he had a bunch of factors, right?
02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000 Yes, or?
02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000 He had a bunch of factors.
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000 But one of the factors was an excess of peanut butter banana, fried sandwich.
02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000 Oh, right.
02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000 Because that can't be good for you.
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000 And he was unhealthy as hell.
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000 That's the sad thing.
02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.000 Is just someone should have been like, bro.
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:11.000 Hey, let's go, let's go one every three days on the fried sandwich.
02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000 It's right.
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:18.000 I tell you, my latest thing is that the, the discipline go in the pills.
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000 Oh, yeah.
02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000 It's a winner.
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000 Every morning, that's just like with my coffee.
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000 Oh, really?
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000 Get it, not you.
02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:25.000 Okay.
02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:28.000 And then if I'm speaking, how many do you take in the morning?
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.000 Okay.
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000 Just on a regular day.
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000 On a day that I'm speaking.
02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000 God, that's good.
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.000 45 minutes before I speak, I take two.
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000 Oh, yeah.
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:42.000 And it is leaving me when I come up and I am on fire.
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:46.000 And so typically, what I'll suffer from, and I don't know why this is.
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:51.000 It's either getting older or traumatic brain injuries, but I'll do a lot of your just dumb.
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000 I'm just, that's my problem.
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000 And it's like, I'll do a lot of words searching where I'm like,
02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000 Oh, you know, this or that, I know,
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.000 two of those things, 45 minutes later for the next hour and a half.
02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000 I am cognitively on fire.
02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000 I'm pulling all the words down.
02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.000 I need.
02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.000 It's awesome.
02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:11.000 You don't want to have to sometimes, because,
02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:15.000 oh, you know, before the bed podcast, I'm going, I'm going,
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000 going with a can at least sometimes, too.
02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:22.000 But like when you're speaking, you can't because you go to pee.
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.000 Yeah, I know.
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000 That's the drawback.
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:28.000 But man, when I get to read a lot,
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:33.000 I'm going to have to hit an afternoon go, can of go.
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.000 Because you're starting to, just starting to not be,
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:39.000 you know, in the, in the, in the, in the mood for reading,
02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.000 do on a freaking whatever Sunday Saturday.
02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000 You're still.
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000 And you already worked out, you're rolled the jiu-jitsu.
02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000 You don't get that post, you jiu-jitsu fatigue.
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000 Yes.
02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000 You don't even talk about it.
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.000 You leave jiu-jitsu with a hype.
02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.000 Yeah.
02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000 Kind of hyped.
02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000 You don't leave tired.
02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000 I never leave.
02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000 I mean, I'm tired physically, but mentally, in the game.
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000 One point five hours later.
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:04.000 Yeah.
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000 I did not feel like freaking reading a book.
02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000 That's what I was going to say.
02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000 They're like that.
02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000 Put what you call post, jiu-jitsu fatigue.
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000 You're whatever.
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:12.000 Right.
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000 Yeah.
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000 It's, I was going to say, it's kind of nice to be honest.
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000 Yeah.
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000 When you don't got nothing to do.
02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000 Yeah.
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000 You got something to do.
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:19.000 You got something to do.
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.000 You got something to do.
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000 You got something to do.
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000 It's true.
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:23.000 It's true.
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000 It's nice to be.
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000 The opportunity to cruise is good.
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000 So anyways, jockelfield.com can check out some of that stuff.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000 Yeah.
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:57.000 And I read, you know, like Rogan was talking about, they took a little bit of break-in.
02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000 So I was nervous about that.
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000 I put some oil on them and warm for a day and a half.
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:03.000 No issues.
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.000 Yeah.
02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000 If you get that butt, that's nice and that's what I'm so.
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000 So good.
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.000 Out of the game.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000 Those things are like comfortable like pajamas.
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000 I've never, like, oh, I put on other work pants.
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.000 It's like putting on cardboard.
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:32.000 Yeah.
02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000 And you put these things on and like, oh, wait a minute.
02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000 I'll see, you know, about the durability that remains to be seen.
02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000 But they are so comfortable.
02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:42.000 And then the way the pockets are lined out.
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000 Yeah.
02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000 Really well thought out.
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.000 Yeah.
02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000 Freaking legit.
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:51.000 And I love the fact that you're wearing them up on the freaking, uh, whatever you call your compound.
02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000 Yeah.
02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000 I'm not a star.
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000 Yeah.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000 That's the thing.
02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000 You're just like, you're wearing them for pajamas.
02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000 Probably.
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000 In case you got to go like kill a bear in the middle of the night.
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000 That's something.
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000 Or you have to clean up after your wife killed the bear.
02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000 So check this out.
02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000 There's, there's some military guys up there training right now.
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.000 And, um, I'm flying down here last night.
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:20.000 Uh, uh, Iris sends me a text and she, the kids had after school archery.
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000 So she went to go pick them up from school.
02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.000 She's driving on from school on this, this military unit that was up there.
02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000 The guys had hit a deer.
02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000 And they pulled over and they were kind of standing there.
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000 They didn't know what to do.
02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:35.000 And Iris could see them and could see the deer flopping around in the middle of the road.
02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.000 Poles of car over grabs a 38 out of the car.
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.000 And we carry guns in the car for this reason.
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:46.000 Because deer get hit all the time on the road and you want to put him on your misery.
02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:52.000 So I could only imagine what these guys saw is she just, what pulls over.
02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000 I need to get these, these are special operations.
02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000 Yes, they are.
02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:58.000 Crack, crack two shots.
02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000 What's going to work?
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000 We got reholstered.
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000 Yep.
02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000 There.
02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000 There.
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:04.000 There.
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.000 Oh, I'm like right on baby.
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000 That's freaking legit.
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000 Iris, Iris Gardner podcast 70, by the way.
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.000 Go listen.
02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:14.000 Go listen to that.
02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000 Hey, what do you do with the deer afterwards?
02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:18.000 You just call it off into the woods or what?
02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000 Oh, no, they have a thing you just call fish and game.
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.000 Oh, yeah.
02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000 And it's been hit on the road.
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.000 And then those guys actually took it and and and butcher it out.
02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000 A lot of them get hit this time here because of the snow.
02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.000 And it warns up that they wanted to be in great food for the.
02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.000 The Eagles and a lot of the raptors and other wildlife because they're they're looking for stuff to eat.
02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000 So nothing gets wasted.
02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:46.000 She got some amazing photographs of some bald Eagles recently that were.
02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.000 Eat one of those road killed there.
02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.000 That is a little jets.
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:57.000 I was just watching this watch and look at it like it's no big deal.
02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.000 Mom's taking care of business.
02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:01.000 Oh, yeah.
02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000 So if you want to get those pants.
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000 Go to or anything else.
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:08.000 All made America by the way, which good news factory.
02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000 Yeah, so that's awesome.
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.000 We got a big factory in North Carolina now.
02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000 So our capabilities are going to increase.
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:22.000 We're going to continue to invest back into the business back into the factories back into the people.
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000 It's just awesome.
02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.000 So if you want to support all that go to origin us a dot com don't support.
02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:32.000 Well, straight up just don't support companies that are.
02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000 That are supporting the communist regime.
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000 Don't do it.
02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.000 Instead support American companies or the USA stock.
02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000 And here's the deal.
02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000 Yeah, that it costs more.
02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:49.000 But when you when you buy something that's a premium product.
02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.000 Over the long haul, it cost you less because it lasts longer.
02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:00.000 And then you're reinvesting that into your community, which is our country, right?
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:09.000 So yeah, so just don't be like those corporations that that to to make five dollars on a pair of pants.
02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000 Ship stuff overseas spend a little bit of extra money.
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000 Get a quality product.
02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:17.000 It will actually cost you less overtime and then you're supporting your community.
02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000 Yeah, and it's so much better for the world.
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.000 What do I mean by that?
02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:27.000 Well, when you when all these factories that are overseas, they have no they have no regulatory environment that they're operating in.
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:32.000 They're just dumping whatever they don't use into the rivers and it's killing everything.
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000 America, there's rules.
02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000 There's rules, not just for the environment.
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000 There's rules for the workers.
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000 All kinds of rules that we have in place here.
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000 So yeah, is it going to be a little bit more expensive?
02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000 Yes, it is.
02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000 We're going to be a better product.
02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000 He hell, yeah, it is.
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000 Is it going to help America, those communities and the world?
02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000 Yes, it actually is.
02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000 So we appreciate that.
02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:58.000 Jockelstore.com.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.000 So that's an awesome shirt.
02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000 There's a foot backwards.
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000 No.
02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000 You can go full layers, huh?
02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.000 Well, that's not a layer in Dean Listers foot.
02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000 That's face, Dean Listers came up with it.
02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000 So it's going to be pretty direct in a lot of ways.
02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000 You know, if it would have said foot backwards, correct me if I'm wrong.
02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.000 Or what is it?

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000 Leadership is a skill.
02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000 It's a skill.
02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000 It's not just something you know how to do.
02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000 It's not.
02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:04.000 No one just knows how to lead.
02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.000 It doesn't work.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000 It's an active, like,
02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000 An active of the, of you.
02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000 Let's do it.
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.000 What parts debatable?
02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.000 What the algorithm?
02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:52.000 Yeah.
02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000 The algorithm is designed for specifically.
02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000 Doesn't always get it right.
02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:01.000 But it's designed to show you what you want to see.
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000 More specifically, it's designed to show you what you want to see.
02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000 So that you click on and watch more.
02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000 It's trying, it's so it is your enemy.
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000 So we're, I'll be, so be careful.
02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000 It could be viewed as what, like,
02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.000 like, a deal with a devil kind of a thing.
02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000 Like you can use it to your advantage though.
02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000 Oh, yeah, fully, fully.
02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000 You can't.
02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.000 But you have to use caution.
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000 Yes.
02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:25.000 I mean, you can use fire to your advantage.
02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000 But you have to use caution.
02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000 And that's especially with you, Jason.
02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000 It's a very pertinent.
02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000 So you can use fire.
02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000 You can use guns to your advantage.
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000 If you have to eliminate or put a deer out of its misery,
02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:43.000 you can also be a jackass with guns.
02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.000 So it's kind of like a double edged sword.
02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000 That caught him.
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000 Yes, that's one.
02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.000 That's one.
02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000 So, so we are on the social media.
02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000 Watch out for the algorithm is the warning.
02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000 Jason's ad Jason and Gardner on Instagram with a period.
02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.000 There's Jason period and period Gardner on Instagram.
02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000 He's also Jason and Gardner.
02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.000 And Gardner, no periods on Twitter.
02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:09.000 And for the Twitter for the Graham and Facebook,
02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:13.000 Akazeneca Charles, I am at Jocco, Willink,
02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:17.000 and to all the military personnel out there around the world,
02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:21.000 representing the flag and all that it stands for,
02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:28.000 all that it's supposed to stand for and protecting those ideals around the world.
02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000 Thank you.
02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000 And thanks also to our police and law enforcement firefighters,
02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.000 Paramedics, EMT's dispatchers,
02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:35.000 correction officers, board patrol, secret service,
02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:38.000 and all the first responders out there.
02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:42.000 Thank you for keeping us safe here at home.
02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:45.000 And remember for everybody else that there are sometimes
02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:48.000 when the odds are stacked against you,
02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.000 when things are falling apart and when you're not sure
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:56.000 how much more you can take or what you can do.
02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:00.000 There are times when things get truly desperate.
02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.000 And sometimes in those scenarios,
02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000 the best thing to do is like Joshua Chamberlain
02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:11.000 and the 20th main is not to sit there and wait to die,
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.000 but instead attack.
02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:20.000 So fix, bayonets, take action, and attack.
02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:25.000 And until next time, this is Jason and Echo and Jocco out.
02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:35.000 Goodbye.
