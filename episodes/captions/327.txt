00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.36 This is Jocopodcast number 327 with me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:07.36 --> 00:00:11.000 The president of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the bronze star medal
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.80 to Petty Officer 3rd class, Philip Francis Torney, United States Navy, for service as set
00:00:17.80 --> 00:00:20.16 forth in the following citation.
00:00:20.16 --> 00:00:25.68 For heroic achievements in connection with the unprovoked and unexpected armed attack on
00:00:25.68 --> 00:00:35.52 USS Liberty, AGTR5 in the eastern Mediterranean on 8 June 1967.
00:00:35.52 --> 00:00:40.36 During the early afternoon hours, USS Liberty, while engaged in peaceful operations
00:00:40.36 --> 00:00:46.80 in international waters, was attacked without any warning by jet fighter aircraft and
00:00:46.80 --> 00:00:51.12 three motor torpedo boats.
00:00:51.12 --> 00:00:56.64 Liberty was subjected to intense incendiary, machine gun and rocket fire and was placed
00:00:56.64 --> 00:01:02.000 in extreme jeopardy by a torpedo hit below the waterline on the starboard side in the
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.64 vicinity of the research compartment.
00:01:06.64 --> 00:01:12.92 Severe structural damage and extensive personnel casualties were incurred.
00:01:12.92 --> 00:01:18.48 Petty Officer Terny, serving as assistant on scene leader in the forward repair party, first
00:01:18.48 --> 00:01:24.88 assisted in organizing the evacuation of wounded personnel from the exposed weather decks.
00:01:24.88 --> 00:01:31.56 With complete disregard for his own personal safety, he continued to furiously expose himself
00:01:31.56 --> 00:01:39.08 to intense rocket and machine gun fire to move a fire fighting team to the bridge.
00:01:39.08 --> 00:01:42.72 He then returned to the forward weather decks to ensure that no more wounded were still
00:01:42.72 --> 00:01:48.08 exposed before going below to maintain damage control conditions of compartments below
00:01:48.08 --> 00:01:50.88 the waterline.
00:01:50.88 --> 00:01:56.92 He remained below dextering the torpedo attack and immediately afterward assisted and directed
00:01:56.92 --> 00:02:02.28 emergency repairs to minimize further flooding and damage.
00:02:02.28 --> 00:02:07.96 His aggressiveness and coolness under fire was exceptionally inspirational leadership
00:02:07.96 --> 00:02:12.84 in an hour of awesome peril.
00:02:12.84 --> 00:02:18.40 Petty Officer Terny's initiative and courageous actions were in keeping with the highest traditions
00:02:18.40 --> 00:02:23.08 of the United States Naval Service.
00:02:23.08 --> 00:02:34.04 Petty Officer Terny is authorized to wear the combat V distinguishing device.
00:02:34.04 --> 00:02:40.56 And that citation reflects an obviously intense and dire situation for a US naval ship
00:02:40.56 --> 00:02:48.40 at the USS Liberty during a vicious and determined attack.
00:02:48.40 --> 00:02:55.20 What the citation does not mention is the state or the enemy force that is conducting the
00:02:55.20 --> 00:02:58.44 attack.
00:02:58.44 --> 00:03:06.60 That is because the attack was conducted by our ally by the state of Israel.
00:03:06.60 --> 00:03:11.60 And this incident, the attack on the USS Liberty has been wrought with controversy as to
00:03:11.60 --> 00:03:16.84 how and why it happened.
00:03:16.84 --> 00:03:23.64 But there can be no controversy or no doubt about the courage and bravery of the sailors
00:03:23.64 --> 00:03:30.76 on the ship that day who suffered significant casualties.
00:03:30.76 --> 00:03:41.48 Who fought to save their shipmates and their ship and his honor to have three of those sailors
00:03:41.48 --> 00:03:47.64 with us here to share their experiences and their lessons learned.
00:03:47.64 --> 00:03:54.20 Phil Terny, Larry Bowen and Joe Meeters, gentlemen.
00:03:54.20 --> 00:03:55.20 Thank you for joining us.
00:03:55.20 --> 00:03:56.72 It's an honor to have you all out here.
00:03:56.72 --> 00:03:59.68 I appreciate you traveling and getting out here.
00:03:59.68 --> 00:04:00.68 Thank you, sir.
00:04:00.68 --> 00:04:09.52 That's about as good as it gets from an American heroys yourself, a sailor, seal,
00:04:09.52 --> 00:04:14.56 bent through it, understands what battles all about.
00:04:14.56 --> 00:04:20.44 When you have nothing to fight back with, but don't know you're willing your guts to
00:04:20.44 --> 00:04:26.08 stay alive is inspirational for all the crew.
00:04:26.08 --> 00:04:30.56 It was all hands on deck regrettably.
00:04:30.56 --> 00:04:34.88 Me and Varship made his lost their lives or severely wounded.
00:04:34.88 --> 00:04:36.92 They had to be evacuated to their stay.
00:04:36.92 --> 00:04:39.68 And we didn't get any help from our government.
00:04:39.68 --> 00:04:48.36 During the attack, after the attack, 18 hours later, we say a cruiser, a destroyer, Maddox,
00:04:48.36 --> 00:04:50.72 not the Maddox, but the Maddy.
00:04:50.72 --> 00:04:51.72 Maddy.
00:04:51.72 --> 00:04:52.72 Maddy.
00:04:52.72 --> 00:04:56.40 He came alongside in the US as Davis, and that was it.
00:04:56.40 --> 00:05:05.76 And those guys came aboard our ship on whale boats and they were actually crying to see
00:05:05.76 --> 00:05:08.16 the devastation of what they did to us.
00:05:08.16 --> 00:05:12.64 Chuck Hill was over 850 cannon rocket holes in our ship.
00:05:12.64 --> 00:05:16.40 Over 5,000 armoured piercing bullets in our ship.
00:05:16.40 --> 00:05:21.76 They dropped napong on the bridge of the ship trying to burn us to pieces.
00:05:21.76 --> 00:05:24.08 They shot our life rafts off.
00:05:24.08 --> 00:05:25.80 We only had three left.
00:05:25.80 --> 00:05:30.20 They shot them out of the water to ensure no more survivors.
00:05:30.20 --> 00:05:35.84 They sent troop carrying helicopters to finish his off.
00:05:35.84 --> 00:05:37.48 For some reason, they didn't do it.
00:05:37.48 --> 00:05:38.48 I guess they got the words.
00:05:38.48 --> 00:05:41.44 It had to gig's up.
00:05:41.44 --> 00:05:43.64 And so was this call of a mistaken identity.
00:05:43.64 --> 00:05:46.08 And that's what everybody says.
00:05:46.08 --> 00:05:48.52 It was a mistaken, oh, for so sorry.
00:05:48.52 --> 00:05:50.48 We say no to that.
00:05:50.48 --> 00:06:00.48 And it was a deliberate, primitive attack, pre-meditated attack by the people of Johnson administration.
00:06:00.48 --> 00:06:06.16 And the escrow, I believe it was named Ambassador.
00:06:06.16 --> 00:06:14.48 I mean the premier of President of Israel at that time, a small cabal of people did so much
00:06:14.48 --> 00:06:18.72 damage not only to us, and our dead shipmates, but to America.
00:06:18.72 --> 00:06:20.000 This is just on our problem.
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000 This is America's problem.
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.44 In Americans like you, this is good gentleman over here and your whole staff are granted
00:06:26.44 --> 00:06:27.44 to light.
00:06:27.44 --> 00:06:28.44 God bless you for that.
00:06:28.44 --> 00:06:31.60 It means the world to me and I know it does my shipmates.
00:06:31.60 --> 00:06:34.08 It's very respectful and very honorable, you sir.
00:06:34.08 --> 00:06:36.08 Thank you.
00:06:36.08 --> 00:06:41.16 Man, it's just the story is harrowing to hear.
00:06:41.16 --> 00:06:46.08 And one of the things I want to go over today is the account that you've written of what
00:06:46.08 --> 00:06:48.16 you went through.
00:06:48.16 --> 00:06:53.68 Before we get to that, just to get a little background on all of you, just if maybe you
00:06:53.68 --> 00:06:58.72 could introduce yourselves where you came from, maybe a quick note on how you ended up in the
00:06:58.72 --> 00:06:59.72 Navy.
00:06:59.72 --> 00:07:04.12 I mean this is 1967, how you ended up in the Navy and really what your job was when you were
00:07:04.12 --> 00:07:05.12 on the liberty.
00:07:05.12 --> 00:07:07.12 Let's start with you, Joe.
00:07:07.12 --> 00:07:08.12 Okay.
00:07:08.12 --> 00:07:09.12 Well, Joe.
00:07:09.12 --> 00:07:10.12 No Larry.
00:07:10.12 --> 00:07:11.12 Oh, sorry.
00:07:11.12 --> 00:07:12.12 Let's start with you, Larry.
00:07:12.12 --> 00:07:13.12 I'm Larry Bowen.
00:07:13.12 --> 00:07:17.84 I'm the current Liberty Veterans Association president.
00:07:17.84 --> 00:07:26.88 In 1965, during the height of the Vietnam War, I got drafted.
00:07:26.88 --> 00:07:31.56 And I didn't want to be boots on the ground over from Vietnam, so I went and talked
00:07:31.56 --> 00:07:33.04 with a Navy recruiter.
00:07:33.04 --> 00:07:38.68 And he says, go take the Army physical and then we'll put you in the Navy.
00:07:38.68 --> 00:07:40.40 I was 19 years old.
00:07:40.40 --> 00:07:42.64 I didn't know if I could trust him or not.
00:07:42.64 --> 00:07:50.64 But I went, I took the physical I passed and by the end of March, I was active duty
00:07:50.64 --> 00:07:56.44 Navy going to Great Lakes Naval Training Center for Boot Camp.
00:07:56.44 --> 00:08:04.72 I became a cryptologic technician or communications technician.
00:08:04.72 --> 00:08:10.40 Shortly thereafter, Boot Camp went to A-Sgood on Empensicola, Florida.
00:08:10.40 --> 00:08:15.44 And I got my first assignment to Burmerhaven-Germany.
00:08:15.44 --> 00:08:17.72 And I thought this was a great tour.
00:08:17.72 --> 00:08:21.28 I just, you know, can't beat this.
00:08:21.28 --> 00:08:26.80 And four months later, I get orders to the USS Liberty.
00:08:26.80 --> 00:08:35.64 So this was my third cruise that I was on when we were reassigned to the Mediterranean
00:08:35.64 --> 00:08:38.56 for the Six Day War.
00:08:38.56 --> 00:08:42.76 And the mission of the Liberty, it's an interesting mission.
00:08:42.76 --> 00:08:50.64 It was really just collection of radio traffic from all over, whoever you were near.
00:08:50.64 --> 00:08:51.64 Right.
00:08:51.64 --> 00:08:55.84 And am I correct in saying that there was literally no weapons on the Liberty?
00:08:55.84 --> 00:08:57.48 Do they have any weapons at all?
00:08:57.48 --> 00:09:02.64 We had four, 50 caliber machine guns, two forward, two aft.
00:09:02.64 --> 00:09:13.96 And then we had small arms, which fell in a wreck of money, we're trying to get into
00:09:13.96 --> 00:09:16.80 when we thought we were going to have to repel borders.
00:09:16.80 --> 00:09:26.08 But the gunlock was secure and they were using, they didn't have a key.
00:09:26.08 --> 00:09:30.40 So they were trying to break the lock with a sledgehammer.
00:09:30.40 --> 00:09:36.80 So they could get in and get small arms out in case we, you know, caseels helicopters
00:09:36.80 --> 00:09:41.32 with a troops down board tried to board us.
00:09:41.32 --> 00:09:49.12 And like Phil said, the, for whatever reason, they stopped.
00:09:49.12 --> 00:09:56.16 And you know, as whether or not we had any casualties and whether or not they could help us.
00:09:56.16 --> 00:10:03.80 And a skipper told him basically, we don't need your help.
00:10:03.80 --> 00:10:12.36 Not in those terms, but you know, I made it very clear that we didn't want them.
00:10:12.36 --> 00:10:13.36 Yeah.
00:10:13.36 --> 00:10:15.52 Phil, how, how'd you end up in the Navy?
00:10:15.52 --> 00:10:17.52 That's a good question.
00:10:17.52 --> 00:10:20.52 I wasn't in school.
00:10:20.52 --> 00:10:23.80 I dropped out of school in the seventh grade.
00:10:23.80 --> 00:10:26.40 And what's the work for my dad?
00:10:26.40 --> 00:10:28.04 Where are you, where'd you go up?
00:10:28.04 --> 00:10:29.84 I grew up in Denver, Colorado.
00:10:29.84 --> 00:10:31.84 Now I live on the Western Slovakia, Colorado.
00:10:31.84 --> 00:10:33.56 I got a 48-corranged there.
00:10:33.56 --> 00:10:36.56 Me and my bride and Lisa said, no, was there.
00:10:36.56 --> 00:10:38.12 Wonderful lady.
00:10:38.12 --> 00:10:41.16 Love her a lot.
00:10:41.16 --> 00:10:45.68 We've raised our kids, but getting back to the Navy, I went to Boom Camp.
00:10:45.68 --> 00:10:50.56 And I was the most thrilled person you could ever imagine.
00:10:50.56 --> 00:10:56.68 Because I was 17 years old, I just turned 17 and joined and luckily I passed the test.
00:10:56.68 --> 00:11:03.76 But I mean, really, I was not very smart, but quite smart.
00:11:03.76 --> 00:11:11.24 And all of a sudden I get awarded to be an educational patty officer.
00:11:11.24 --> 00:11:16.92 I said, how did I get this?
00:11:16.92 --> 00:11:21.16 And my parents took it good.
00:11:21.16 --> 00:11:28.04 We got along and I'll be darned if I wasn't both outstanding recruit of my troop.
00:11:28.04 --> 00:11:30.40 And that was some of my parents.
00:11:30.40 --> 00:11:32.20 I'll never forget that.
00:11:32.20 --> 00:11:36.44 A bunch of good guys and there's old as I am now.
00:11:36.44 --> 00:11:37.44 40.
00:11:37.44 --> 00:11:39.44 What year was that?
00:11:39.44 --> 00:11:40.44 What year did you join?
00:11:40.44 --> 00:11:41.44 64.
00:11:41.44 --> 00:11:42.44 1964.
00:11:42.44 --> 00:11:43.44 OK.
00:11:43.44 --> 00:11:46.28 And what was your job?
00:11:46.28 --> 00:11:50.76 My first job was being a boilerman.
00:11:50.76 --> 00:11:51.76 And machinist mate.
00:11:51.76 --> 00:11:53.36 I was on different ships.
00:11:53.36 --> 00:11:57.56 So you guys just wanted to hear, you guys just hallowed, hallowed, hallowed, that I've one of
00:11:57.56 --> 00:12:03.28 the seas with to be at nom, we have a little ammo to constellation other ships.
00:12:03.28 --> 00:12:13.12 And we would also pick up bodies that were flown to one part of the other.
00:12:13.12 --> 00:12:14.76 We take them back to seaweed bankers.
00:12:14.76 --> 00:12:17.64 We had coolers for the ammo stuff.
00:12:17.64 --> 00:12:20.24 And that was basically our deal for a couple of years.
00:12:20.24 --> 00:12:21.96 And then I got transferred to the library.
00:12:21.96 --> 00:12:24.80 I said, oh, God, this has got to be great.
00:12:24.80 --> 00:12:25.80 What a good ship.
00:12:25.80 --> 00:12:26.80 A beautiful ship.
00:12:26.80 --> 00:12:28.08 Good people.
00:12:28.08 --> 00:12:31.56 Enjoyable, good skippers.
00:12:31.56 --> 00:12:33.96 I can't say enough about the US.
00:12:33.96 --> 00:12:35.000 It's literally in your right.
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.20 It was like a giant lobster out in the sea.
00:12:40.20 --> 00:12:42.52 Nobody could miss the identify that ship.
00:12:42.52 --> 00:12:48.28 So that's pretty much my naval career up to the attack.
00:12:48.28 --> 00:12:52.24 Then I got transferred to the US as mad as Taufer Gondick.
00:12:52.24 --> 00:12:53.24 Talking.
00:12:53.24 --> 00:12:57.44 So it's a bit of interesting ride.
00:12:57.44 --> 00:13:00.12 Joe, how'd you end up in the Navy?
00:13:00.12 --> 00:13:04.28 In 1966 I was in my second year of college.
00:13:04.28 --> 00:13:07.16 Didn't know what I wanted to do in my life.
00:13:07.16 --> 00:13:14.20 I didn't want ready for graduation or anything like that.
00:13:14.20 --> 00:13:22.52 I didn't want to be in the army and go to Vietnam, live in a foxhole for my four years.
00:13:22.52 --> 00:13:26.12 So I decided to join the Navy instead.
00:13:26.12 --> 00:13:27.12 So I went and joined.
00:13:27.12 --> 00:13:31.40 And then I went home and told my mom what I did.
00:13:31.40 --> 00:13:33.92 She was about to head a fit.
00:13:33.92 --> 00:13:39.96 But in hindsight she told me that it was a probably the best idea that I had the best thing
00:13:39.96 --> 00:13:41.16 I ever did.
00:13:41.16 --> 00:13:48.000 Went to boot camp in Great Lakes and I got to sign to the drill team, which was fortunate
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000 for me.
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.60 It was number nine, twelve.
00:13:50.60 --> 00:13:54.68 Fortunate for me and the rest of the guys because I don't think I did more than 100
00:13:54.68 --> 00:14:00.88 pushups during my time in boot camp.
00:14:00.88 --> 00:14:01.88 And what was your rate?
00:14:01.88 --> 00:14:03.04 Well, how was the signal then?
00:14:03.04 --> 00:14:10.12 I went from boot camp to a class a signalman school in Newport, Rhode Island and then graduated
00:14:10.12 --> 00:14:12.28 from that and went to the Liberty.
00:14:12.28 --> 00:14:19.48 And I never could figure out why since the Liberty steamed independently in my rate, I had
00:14:19.48 --> 00:14:22.48 flashing light and similar four between ships.
00:14:22.48 --> 00:14:23.48 What was I doing there?
00:14:23.48 --> 00:14:25.36 Or you're going to talk to your brother.
00:14:25.36 --> 00:14:27.76 That's an interesting thing about the Liberty because of its mission.
00:14:27.76 --> 00:14:30.04 It would just go out by itself.
00:14:30.04 --> 00:14:36.48 The normal Navy ships they go out in a group, in a carrier battle group or a amphibious
00:14:36.48 --> 00:14:37.48 ready group.
00:14:37.48 --> 00:14:41.10 There's multiple ships, but you guys on the liberty you would just kind of sail around by
00:14:41.10 --> 00:14:42.10 yourselves.
00:14:42.10 --> 00:14:43.10 Exactly.
00:14:43.10 --> 00:14:45.60 On that's because of the mission.
00:14:45.60 --> 00:14:53.14 With if we were in a group, their communications would interfere with our ability to collect
00:14:53.14 --> 00:14:56.72 communications that we were trying to collect.
00:14:56.72 --> 00:15:05.36 So it was by design that we would go independently, typically off the west coast of Africa.
00:15:05.36 --> 00:15:13.68 In fact, our first port on that last cruise was we pulled in an abogent and it was in
00:15:13.68 --> 00:15:21.80 May of 1967 when we got orders to go to Rotospeen to pick up supplies and some additional
00:15:21.80 --> 00:15:22.80 people.
00:15:22.80 --> 00:15:26.72 So we were going to the Eastern Med, couldn't tell our folks or anything.
00:15:26.72 --> 00:15:32.48 They said, hey, this is all hush hush.
00:15:32.48 --> 00:15:38.72 At that time, I don't know that any of us knew what was going on in the Middle East.
00:15:38.72 --> 00:15:39.96 But yeah, that's a good point.
00:15:39.96 --> 00:15:45.56 I know when I first got in the Navy and I did a couple deployments as a seal on a ship.
00:15:45.56 --> 00:15:47.32 I mean, no, it was no internet.
00:15:47.32 --> 00:15:52.000 So you really were isolated in terms of what was going on in the world.
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:03.04 So what was going on in the world at that time was that the Israeli six day war was happening.
00:16:03.04 --> 00:16:07.52 This is a war that took place from the fifth to the June to the tenth to June.
00:16:07.52 --> 00:16:17.92 It was Israeli versus a bunch of Arab countries, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia,
00:16:17.92 --> 00:16:24.32 the total elements of Lebanon in there and the Israel had initiated.
00:16:24.32 --> 00:16:25.76 And there was a bunch of things that led up to this.
00:16:25.76 --> 00:16:33.32 But Israel had initiated the war with air strikes on Egyptian and Syrian airfields.
00:16:33.32 --> 00:16:37.52 They'd pretty much wiped out the Egyptian air force.
00:16:37.52 --> 00:16:42.96 On the six of June there was ground fighting that was taking place as the Israeli military
00:16:42.96 --> 00:16:47.44 pushed into the Sinai Peninsula.
00:16:47.44 --> 00:16:51.68 On the seventh of June they pushed even further into the Sinai.
00:16:51.68 --> 00:16:58.08 The Israeli Navy was probing the Egyptian Navy.
00:16:58.08 --> 00:17:04.08 There was Israeli missile boats, missile ships that were out there that engaged Egyptian
00:17:04.08 --> 00:17:05.36 shore batteries.
00:17:05.36 --> 00:17:10.08 So this is even though it's a short war, there's a lot happening in a pretty small area,
00:17:10.08 --> 00:17:12.12 as well.
00:17:12.12 --> 00:17:21.000 The Jordanians attacked and sent a lot of artillery into Jerusalem.
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.20 By the seventh though, I mean Israeli, and this was just a couple days into it, Israel had
00:17:26.20 --> 00:17:31.76 gotten control over much of the West Bank.
00:17:31.76 --> 00:17:34.28 Eight to June, these things are continuing to happen.
00:17:34.28 --> 00:17:40.16 So I just wanted to kind of give some background as to what was happening when this event
00:17:40.16 --> 00:17:43.60 took place for you guys.
00:17:43.60 --> 00:17:47.48 So I was just talking about June 8th.
00:17:47.48 --> 00:17:49.28 This is when these attacks were just continuing.
00:17:49.28 --> 00:17:51.88 This is in the midst of this war.
00:17:51.88 --> 00:17:55.24 And even though, like I said, it's short, but there's a lot of fighting going on.
00:17:55.24 --> 00:17:58.12 There's 20,000 air troops were killed in this short period of time.
00:17:58.12 --> 00:18:02.96 Israel lost under a thousand, but that's still significant.
00:18:02.96 --> 00:18:10.76 So in the midst of all of that, this attack on your ship happens and Phil, you've got
00:18:10.76 --> 00:18:16.76 some personal accounts that you've written out, and these are just to me a great way
00:18:16.76 --> 00:18:24.40 of tracing how this went down from your perspective, Phil, and then Larry and Joe, you
00:18:24.40 --> 00:18:25.72 guys can give some input as well.
00:18:25.72 --> 00:18:30.52 But I just want to read some of these accounts because I always think when I write things
00:18:30.52 --> 00:18:33.72 down, they come across a little bit clearer to solidify my memories.
00:18:33.72 --> 00:18:39.36 So here's what you said about the first day and how this whole thing kicked off, Phil.
00:18:39.36 --> 00:18:43.48 You say this, my job on the morning of June 8th was sound insecurity.
00:18:43.48 --> 00:18:46.72 I would make the rounds to ensure that everything on my checklist was in good condition
00:18:46.72 --> 00:18:51.92 that the ship was watertight and ship-shaped as I reported hourly to the bridge.
00:18:51.92 --> 00:18:56.60 I did not see the first overflights by Israeli aircraft, but the other guys told me about
00:18:56.60 --> 00:19:01.84 them. We assumed that they were our friends and knowing that they were merely confirming
00:19:01.84 --> 00:19:06.84 that we were an American ship caused our moods to further light.
00:19:06.84 --> 00:19:10.72 After lunch, a general quarters drill was conducted right after that, I had to accompany
00:19:10.72 --> 00:19:16.32 another engineer to the starboard gun mount on the forecast on the folksalt that I just
00:19:16.32 --> 00:19:17.32 say that's right.
00:19:17.32 --> 00:19:22.16 You just busted a damn navy guy, totally messin' that one up.
00:19:22.16 --> 00:19:26.56 To fix the phone located there, David Skolack, my saying that right?
00:19:26.56 --> 00:19:30.96 Yes, David Skolack was the other sailor I went with and after I explained to him what
00:19:30.96 --> 00:19:33.88 needed to be done, his response was no problem, attorney.
00:19:33.88 --> 00:19:35.96 I'll get working on her.
00:19:35.96 --> 00:19:39.88 This was about five minutes before the attack at 2 o'clock PM.
00:19:39.88 --> 00:19:43.40 As we stood there, we discussed the fact that this would be the worst possible place to
00:19:43.40 --> 00:19:48.76 be in the event of an attack on the ship because the gun tub and the guy manning it would
00:19:48.76 --> 00:19:52.24 be taken out as the first priority.
00:19:52.24 --> 00:19:57.20 I said goodbye to Skolack and the gunner and made my way down the ladder to the main deck
00:19:57.20 --> 00:20:01.44 and my workstation in the ship fitters shop.
00:20:01.44 --> 00:20:06.14 As I opened the hatch to go inside, I heard an order over the PA to test the motor whale
00:20:06.14 --> 00:20:07.14 boat.
00:20:07.14 --> 00:20:11.36 Just moments later, I heard a huge explosion right next to the hatch.
00:20:11.36 --> 00:20:12.92 I had just closed.
00:20:12.92 --> 00:20:17.96 My immediate thought was that the test had gone wrong and the motor whale boat had blown
00:20:17.96 --> 00:20:18.96 up.
00:20:18.96 --> 00:20:24.16 That's how this thing kicks off.
00:20:24.16 --> 00:20:30.32 It was a normal day where you guys were able to track the wars happening where you
00:20:30.32 --> 00:20:34.76 guys could you hear explosions, could you guys see fighting taking place, were you seeing
00:20:34.76 --> 00:20:37.24 tracers in the sky at night and that kind of thing?
00:20:37.24 --> 00:20:47.16 We saw smoke from the L.I.R. area where they were attacking the Egyptian forces but we didn't
00:20:47.16 --> 00:20:50.78 hear anything and no tracers.
00:20:50.78 --> 00:20:54.16 Did you guys feel safe and secure out there?
00:20:54.16 --> 00:20:55.16 I did.
00:20:55.16 --> 00:20:56.16 Yeah, really.
00:20:56.16 --> 00:20:57.16 Yeah, absolutely.
00:20:57.16 --> 00:21:02.32 I mean, who was going to attack a flag to American ship?
00:21:02.32 --> 00:21:06.08 We saw a fan base was going to get us to be the Arabs.
00:21:06.08 --> 00:21:13.92 Besides we were told that we had an air cover in 30 minutes if we were ever attacked.
00:21:13.92 --> 00:21:19.28 Did you remember anything else that you remember about the day before it kicked off?
00:21:19.28 --> 00:21:23.88 That morning I was setting a position down in radio research one.
00:21:23.88 --> 00:21:33.76 I was an intercept operator and I had picked up some traffic that was actually part of the
00:21:33.76 --> 00:21:43.72 ground forces communicating back on Tel Aviv and my buddy Bob Eisenberg who was working
00:21:43.72 --> 00:21:51.28 in the processing and reporting center, we went to the child together at lunchtime and he told
00:21:51.28 --> 00:22:01.52 me that they were planning a big attack and it was a prolonged kind of thing where they had
00:22:01.52 --> 00:22:12.92 three different prongs to this attack, the jet strafing, the napalm and the torpedo boats.
00:22:12.92 --> 00:22:20.88 What Bob didn't tell me was who the target was, apparently they didn't spell that out in
00:22:20.88 --> 00:22:25.48 their communications.
00:22:25.48 --> 00:22:29.64 That was before we had our practice general quarters drill.
00:22:29.64 --> 00:22:38.84 I don't know if maybe Commander Lewis had sent word up to the skipper that, hey, there's
00:22:38.84 --> 00:22:40.24 things they're going to intensify here.
00:22:40.24 --> 00:22:48.76 Or maybe we ought to do a drill, but there were certainly indications and accounts that
00:22:48.76 --> 00:22:51.40 something big was going to happen.
00:22:51.40 --> 00:22:57.64 Unfortunately, we didn't know that it was us that they were targeting.
00:22:57.64 --> 00:23:02.32 Because during the morning these overflights that occurred and they started early in the
00:23:02.32 --> 00:23:09.92 morning I thought we had at least four or five overflights by Israelia aircraft.
00:23:09.92 --> 00:23:16.92 We would send our photo recon team up to the bridge to take photographs and we knew,
00:23:16.92 --> 00:23:21.44 we could see the star David on the aircraft.
00:23:21.44 --> 00:23:30.04 In my mind I felt pretty secure that our ally was going to cover us and not be the ones
00:23:30.04 --> 00:23:35.64 that was going to do the attack.
00:23:35.64 --> 00:23:40.92 Did there anything else on that?
00:23:40.92 --> 00:23:45.32 There was a signal when I was up on the top deck that was an open deck.
00:23:45.32 --> 00:23:51.60 Steel plies, sightings around the deck.
00:23:51.60 --> 00:24:00.64 I could see all of the reconnaissance aircraft come in circle this in the morning.
00:24:00.64 --> 00:24:07.16 I served quartermaster watches which I didn't like but what's it got to do.
00:24:07.16 --> 00:24:14.56 I was done in the pilot house and Larry and Lloyd Painter was the officer of the deck.
00:24:14.56 --> 00:24:19.84 He was a junior officer of the deck I believe and he was watching the radar surface
00:24:19.84 --> 00:24:21.24 search radar.
00:24:21.24 --> 00:24:26.12 He spotted the aircraft coming up or a starward side.
00:24:26.12 --> 00:24:29.04 Very low to the deck because we didn't have any air search.
00:24:29.04 --> 00:24:35.80 It was just surface search so they got slowly or quickly up our starward side turned immediately
00:24:35.80 --> 00:24:41.28 left and then left again when they got straight ahead of us and then started the attack.
00:24:41.28 --> 00:24:46.04 The Israelis claim that they conducted a series of low and slow identification runs
00:24:46.04 --> 00:24:53.24 and I don't think anybody would believe that a screaming jet would nobody could see it
00:24:53.24 --> 00:24:54.60 nobody could hear it.
00:24:54.60 --> 00:25:01.60 Those are the identification runs so they've lied about it since the outset.
00:25:01.60 --> 00:25:08.04 All right.
00:25:08.04 --> 00:25:11.56 Let's pick up Phil with your account after you hear this explosion.
00:25:11.56 --> 00:25:15.48 You say not realizing that a rocket just exploded directly outside the hatch I grabbed
00:25:15.48 --> 00:25:18.72 the handle and opened it once more to go out and investigate the trouble.
00:25:18.72 --> 00:25:22.72 I just barely put one foot outside when I felt myself grabbed by the shirt collar and
00:25:22.72 --> 00:25:24.92 violently jerked back inside.
00:25:24.92 --> 00:25:30.28 I turned and saw it was first class petty officer Dale Nies who ordered me to get back
00:25:30.28 --> 00:25:32.72 we're under attack.
00:25:32.72 --> 00:25:37.24 The general quarters alarm was then sounded and I made my way to my duty station which
00:25:37.24 --> 00:25:42.16 was which as one deck which was one deck above the mess decks.
00:25:42.16 --> 00:25:46.44 After going down the ladder I slipped and fell and found myself under trampling feet
00:25:46.44 --> 00:25:49.16 of sailors as they made their way to their stations.
00:25:49.16 --> 00:25:52.96 I rolled over to my right side to get out of the way and got on my feet and joined the stampede
00:25:52.96 --> 00:25:54.60 to get to my station as well.
00:25:54.60 --> 00:25:57.24 I got into battle dress and got my gear ready.
00:25:57.24 --> 00:26:02.68 Chief Thompson was the on scene leader as soon as I arrived he said he'd been hit and I
00:26:02.68 --> 00:26:05.32 was leaving and he was leaving to get medical care.
00:26:05.32 --> 00:26:10.04 Since I was assistant on scene leader this man I was in charge.
00:26:10.04 --> 00:26:12.000 It's all yours now, attorney.
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.92 He said as he made his way down the passage.
00:26:13.92 --> 00:26:14.92 I responded back.
00:26:14.92 --> 00:26:16.92 Hey, thanks a lot, Chief.
00:26:16.92 --> 00:26:21.76 Although I was not that thrilled about this ad hoc promotion.
00:26:21.76 --> 00:26:25.96 So just for people that haven't been in the Navy tell us about general quarters what's
00:26:25.96 --> 00:26:26.96 going on.
00:26:26.96 --> 00:26:27.96 Right.
00:26:27.96 --> 00:26:34.04 General quarters is something we did aboard that ship constantly.
00:26:34.04 --> 00:26:41.92 I got aboard delivery when it just commissioned and it made one cruise and I stayed on it
00:26:41.92 --> 00:26:44.28 for the rest of them till the last one.
00:26:44.28 --> 00:26:49.000 Every captain I served on there and there was only two.
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.96 McGonadol was very strict about damage control, cleanliness.
00:26:55.96 --> 00:27:04.80 He evaluated everything you did and I think that really really set us up to be at least
00:27:04.80 --> 00:27:09.92 to try to be able to save our ship and save our shipmates.
00:27:09.92 --> 00:27:17.24 It's a training we received with the good graces of God.
00:27:17.24 --> 00:27:22.40 We were able to keep the ship afloat and it just wasn't us.
00:27:22.40 --> 00:27:25.52 It was a higher power that saved us.
00:27:25.52 --> 00:27:29.12 Nobody else came to help us but it's a good lord.
00:27:29.12 --> 00:27:32.44 I believe that now and I always believed it done.
00:27:32.44 --> 00:27:33.44 Interesting Jocco.
00:27:33.44 --> 00:27:39.24 I thought when the attack started and we didn't get any help.
00:27:39.24 --> 00:27:43.60 I thought well okay this is World War III and these guys got better things to do than
00:27:43.60 --> 00:27:45.72 screw with us.
00:27:45.72 --> 00:27:48.16 The American government because they're doing their own thing.
00:27:48.16 --> 00:27:51.64 That's what I really thought because they wouldn't leave us out there alone that we were
00:27:51.64 --> 00:27:56.64 promised help and I'll be darn yeah.
00:27:56.64 --> 00:27:57.88 No help came.
00:27:57.88 --> 00:28:00.08 We were out there alone by ourselves.
00:28:00.08 --> 00:28:01.08 No armament.
00:28:01.08 --> 00:28:07.04 Our ship is burning out people all over the deck on a sleeping diet.
00:28:07.04 --> 00:28:12.04 Trying to get into racks or whatever they could just to stay alive.
00:28:12.04 --> 00:28:16.32 It was I can't say it was real chaos.
00:28:16.32 --> 00:28:22.20 It's an organized chaos just do your job and I don't do anything else but do your job.
00:28:22.20 --> 00:28:24.72 What was your job during General Quarter's?
00:28:24.72 --> 00:28:25.72 Damage control.
00:28:25.72 --> 00:28:30.24 So did you take over for you or the damage control senior guy at this point?
00:28:30.24 --> 00:28:31.72 That report, yes.
00:28:31.72 --> 00:28:37.000 Was it for that specific part of the ship or was it for the part of the ship?
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:46.08 The other damage control was James Smith and he was fighting fires and doing all I could.
00:28:46.08 --> 00:28:49.44 In fact, that's when a Spicer got killed.
00:28:49.44 --> 00:28:50.44 He was a postal clerk.
00:28:50.44 --> 00:28:51.84 He was manning a hose.
00:28:51.84 --> 00:29:01.48 That was his General Quarter's drill and station to fight fires and Smitty just got through the hatch
00:29:01.48 --> 00:29:03.48 and then Spicer was hit.
00:29:03.48 --> 00:29:07.52 I might also had Spitty and I made third class together.
00:29:07.52 --> 00:29:13.84 E4s and he stayed in for 27 years and he came out of Lieutenant Command.
00:29:13.84 --> 00:29:15.76 He was on a lot of different ships.
00:29:15.76 --> 00:29:16.76 Spitty is a great guy.
00:29:16.76 --> 00:29:17.76 He's a great hero.
00:29:17.76 --> 00:29:18.76 All these guys are heroes.
00:29:18.76 --> 00:29:22.96 They're my alter ego.
00:29:22.96 --> 00:29:26.20 I respect these guys because they help save everybody's lives.
00:29:26.20 --> 00:29:30.24 Including mine without these people I wouldn't be alive today.
00:29:30.24 --> 00:29:32.40 Joe, what did you have to do during General Quarter's?
00:29:32.40 --> 00:29:38.60 General Quarter's as a signal man, my job was look out and look for ships to communicate
00:29:38.60 --> 00:29:41.40 with, haha.
00:29:41.40 --> 00:29:48.28 And so when the attack started, Mom and I didn't raise no fools and that signal bridge
00:29:48.28 --> 00:29:50.52 was totally open.
00:29:50.52 --> 00:29:57.48 So I stayed down in the pilot house where that was my work station basically in the pilot
00:29:57.48 --> 00:29:58.96 house.
00:29:58.96 --> 00:30:03.92 And occasionally I would look at the port wing of the bridge and look up and make sure the
00:30:03.92 --> 00:30:05.60 flag was flying.
00:30:05.60 --> 00:30:10.68 Did that a couple times and then I noticed it wasn't flying so Frank Brown and I Frank
00:30:10.68 --> 00:30:13.92 was killed while he was on the helm.
00:30:13.92 --> 00:30:18.08 Frank Brown and I took holiday colors and ended up on number four port high and I was
00:30:18.08 --> 00:30:21.52 up flying during the complete torpedo attack.
00:30:21.52 --> 00:30:24.28 And holiday colors is an even bigger flag.
00:30:24.28 --> 00:30:26.72 That's the normal biggest flag we have.
00:30:26.72 --> 00:30:29.56 And then by 13, that cracked you up.
00:30:29.56 --> 00:30:30.56 That's something like that.
00:30:30.56 --> 00:30:34.40 Yeah, 7 by 13 feet.
00:30:34.40 --> 00:30:38.000 What about you Larry, where did you go once General Quarter's kicked off?
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.68 They, like I said, I had a day watch that day.
00:30:41.68 --> 00:30:44.16 So I was sounding radio research one.
00:30:44.16 --> 00:30:50.48 When they sounded General Quarter's, I moved up one deck to another position doing the
00:30:50.48 --> 00:30:55.04 same job with a cadre of other CTs.
00:30:55.04 --> 00:31:00.92 And one of, like I was an IR brancher, there was a T brancher in there.
00:31:00.92 --> 00:31:01.92 We had an O brancher.
00:31:01.92 --> 00:31:04.20 What's the IR branch T branch O branch?
00:31:04.20 --> 00:31:06.28 Okay, IR brancher was a radio man.
00:31:06.28 --> 00:31:07.28 Okay.
00:31:07.28 --> 00:31:11.44 T brancher were the technical electronic skies.
00:31:11.44 --> 00:31:13.52 We had a maintenance sky in there.
00:31:13.52 --> 00:31:20.80 We also had an IR brancher which is a linguist.
00:31:20.80 --> 00:31:28.24 And so we took positions one deck above where the torpedo hit.
00:31:28.24 --> 00:31:34.16 And when the torpedo entered, we all got blown to the overhead.
00:31:34.16 --> 00:31:35.16 Got concussions.
00:31:35.16 --> 00:31:39.20 That's probably when I got my shrapnel wounds.
00:31:39.20 --> 00:31:46.40 And you know, it wasn't until right after that that we were able to go out and start opening
00:31:46.40 --> 00:31:50.76 up the hatch and get people out from the flooding compartment below.
00:31:50.76 --> 00:31:57.76 But when Phil mentioned that we had this, you know, 29 by 39 foot of hole in the starboard
00:31:57.76 --> 00:32:06.20 side, that killed 25 of our crew members that were down in the research spaces.
00:32:06.20 --> 00:32:14.52 And you know, one of our primary concerns was getting anyone who's still alive, getting
00:32:14.52 --> 00:32:19.72 them out of there and getting them up to safety.
00:32:19.72 --> 00:32:25.96 So as soon as we got the hatch open and people started coming out of the flooding compartment,
00:32:25.96 --> 00:32:33.52 I had a secondary job of going to the front door to our compartmented spaces and handing
00:32:33.52 --> 00:32:39.32 out life jackets to everybody so that if we had to abandon ship, at least everybody
00:32:39.32 --> 00:32:42.92 would have the life for a server.
00:32:42.92 --> 00:32:48.04 And that was before we ended up at the end after everybody got out of there or if we thought
00:32:48.04 --> 00:32:54.64 everybody had gotten out of there, we'd talked on the hatch and had to close up the area,
00:32:54.64 --> 00:33:02.64 secure it.
00:33:02.64 --> 00:33:09.64 Going back to this account from Phil once again, I started my new duties by determining whether
00:33:09.64 --> 00:33:13.56 all damage control personnel were accounted for but found that several were still missing
00:33:13.56 --> 00:33:16.000 which was not surprising considering the circumstances.
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.88 The torrent of explosions I was hearing above and all around me had something to do with
00:33:20.88 --> 00:33:25.92 that and the holes that began appearing everywhere around us from the rocket and can
00:33:25.92 --> 00:33:30.80 and fire were further evidence of the intensity of the attack.
00:33:30.80 --> 00:33:34.80 In the middle of the this onslaught, I caught a piece of shrapnel for inches long in my
00:33:34.80 --> 00:33:37.000 right arm just above the elbow.
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.48 I pulled it out through it on the deck and moved everyone in my department to the main
00:33:40.48 --> 00:33:48.16 deck. Once there I went to the same gun tub that I visited earlier but only saw a pile
00:33:48.16 --> 00:33:54.12 of human remains, blood, hunks of human flash body parts and fragments of bone.
00:33:54.12 --> 00:33:55.96 Rick a meady, am I saying that right?
00:33:55.96 --> 00:34:01.92 Rick a meady was there with me and we knew there was no life to be saved so we moved
00:34:01.92 --> 00:34:02.92 on.
00:34:02.92 --> 00:34:07.34 Throughout this time machine gun bullets and rocket fire were raining down on us as we
00:34:07.34 --> 00:34:19.58 crouched down behind various structures leaping from one position to another.
00:34:19.58 --> 00:34:24.86 So this is I mean there's just this entire ship that's just getting raked with machine gun
00:34:24.86 --> 00:34:31.34 fire with rockets with bullets. These bullets you're talking about they're penetrating
00:34:31.34 --> 00:34:34.34 the skin of the ship and just going through creating holes immediately.
00:34:34.34 --> 00:34:44.06 Arm rehearsing bullets here exactly right, Jockel and it was it was an attack that there was
00:34:44.06 --> 00:34:52.90 no mercy. There was no explanation in our mind because we didn't know really who was
00:34:52.90 --> 00:34:58.78 doing it. They were doing it with unmarked yet aircraft until we saw the torpedo boats and
00:34:58.78 --> 00:35:01.90 they had to star David. I said, oh god they're here to help us.
00:35:01.90 --> 00:35:08.58 Now a little bit of a yell you fired five torpedoes at us. Five torpedoes and only one
00:35:08.58 --> 00:35:13.42 of him hit and it happened to hit an eye beam where we didn't take the full explosion
00:35:13.42 --> 00:35:22.06 and it was more but not word deal but as Larry was saying 25 of America's most intelligent
00:35:22.06 --> 00:35:32.22 secret personnel in the world all of them top secret were instantly blown to bits and it's
00:35:32.22 --> 00:35:36.54 just something you can't describe to see your own ship makes like that and you know they're
00:35:36.54 --> 00:35:43.10 down there and once it got killed on deck we already put them in body bags and the ones
00:35:43.10 --> 00:35:51.58 that were at playing to life. Doc Heafer took care of them. I helped in operations all these
00:35:51.58 --> 00:35:57.58 other guys did what they could to help people it was a unified ship and it was two different
00:35:57.58 --> 00:36:04.38 cruise more dead ship to spokes and us. So we were the idiots and these were the smart guys
00:36:04.38 --> 00:36:10.78 and it's too bad. I mean that with all due respect, believe me all due respect but these guys
00:36:10.78 --> 00:36:14.94 here took the front of the dams and you know what, Jacko they didn't they didn't lose
00:36:14.94 --> 00:36:21.18 their duty stations they could have run out of there but they stayed there doing their duty
00:36:21.18 --> 00:36:31.42 and gave the lies for it and it was inspirational. You think about that and then the torpedo hit
00:36:32.22 --> 00:36:39.90 the torpedo gunboats would come up alongside of us in fire at our fire fighters, stretchers
00:36:39.90 --> 00:36:47.10 of bears, anybody on deck they're that close, shoot nests you know I mean out of us and it's
00:36:47.10 --> 00:36:56.14 uh it never occurred to me as I've said many times that how another country or human being could
00:36:56.14 --> 00:37:04.38 do that to their own supposedly friends and get by with it and then come back and say have you
00:37:04.38 --> 00:37:10.14 cash a lease have you any cash I just fly it all over the decks commander castle was in one
00:37:10.14 --> 00:37:15.66 of the it's a really helicopters he was as it had to at the shade there in Israel he dropped
00:37:16.70 --> 00:37:22.70 a card was his name on it and the brackets is have you casualties and I thought to myself
00:37:22.70 --> 00:37:30.62 my god how could this I mean the guys got to be able to see and it just everybody was
00:37:30.62 --> 00:37:36.38 astounded by that the captain told it get to helicopter tell the whole way for my ship get it out
00:37:36.38 --> 00:37:45.10 of your now and they did and we were all alone our country but promises help we expected help
00:37:45.10 --> 00:37:51.58 the jitter a craft for callback by Worsington Mac D'Ambara and LBGA and all his cronies
00:37:51.58 --> 00:38:04.94 uh including uh Admiral McCain used a commanding officer of European forces Europe and uh he was
00:38:04.94 --> 00:38:11.34 a huge part of the cover up the important bit choir only when seven days seven days it was wrapped up
00:38:11.34 --> 00:38:16.62 it was all pretty predetermined what the outcomes going to be mistaken identity they say they paid
00:38:16.62 --> 00:38:22.46 six million dollars or ten million or whatever the crew was compensated they compensated
00:38:22.46 --> 00:38:31.42 the most of the crew 200 bucks for their their clothes or maybe they're whatever but the average
00:38:31.42 --> 00:38:35.74 was 200 bucks the most seriously guy said got wounded days and served every penny they got
00:38:36.70 --> 00:38:41.90 but it wasn't nothing like they said it was and it was our money they were given right back to us
00:38:41.90 --> 00:38:49.50 so it is will never put out a dime you nine states paid for it all and they sold our ship for
00:38:50.14 --> 00:38:54.94 measly a couple hundred thousand dollars they cut up and raised their blades to make sure
00:38:54.94 --> 00:39:02.54 the evidence was gone but they didn't they didn't count on us for fifty five years telling you guys
00:39:03.26 --> 00:39:07.90 hey you're you're lying to the American public and you're not going to get by with it that's why
00:39:07.90 --> 00:39:15.42 we're here now America's two great two great of a country is it is service nation as you well know
00:39:15.42 --> 00:39:22.22 you you've been there you know what it's all about and you didn't get you know nobody turned
00:39:22.22 --> 00:39:29.42 the back on you because you had backup your own men and you know to the last man it's it's not
00:39:29.42 --> 00:39:35.02 over till it's over but it was like that way it was us it's not over till it's over we're so
00:39:35.02 --> 00:39:41.34 large the ship didn't roll over and the next day they got there and like I see
00:39:42.54 --> 00:39:49.98 massing the Davis is guys before the ship just in tears it was the hated see their own shipmates
00:39:51.50 --> 00:39:58.30 get torn apart like that it would no help it coming to find out you know I think the Navy
00:39:58.30 --> 00:40:04.86 did try to help us but the government the higher ups wouldn't wouldn't come to our aid and it's
00:40:04.86 --> 00:40:09.98 pretty sad this one pilot he's in this film on one by the way I wanted to give you this
00:40:09.98 --> 00:40:15.58 job I think you've seen this haven't you I have not seen that no okay this is a sacrificing liberty
00:40:16.70 --> 00:40:23.26 go to sacrifice and liberty dot com sacrifice and liberty dot com this is a four part series
00:40:23.26 --> 00:40:30.86 it's one of the best series has ever been done and truthful it's all about many survivors
00:40:31.74 --> 00:40:36.38 in this film telling the truth and it's my great honor and pleasure to give this to you
00:40:36.94 --> 00:40:41.42 and I hope you you watch it to spread the word jacco thank you thank you
00:40:44.70 --> 00:40:50.62 one one thing that should be noted about the 25 men killed by the torpedo is that they probably
00:40:50.62 --> 00:40:56.30 would have survived the attack if lb j hadn't recalled the aircraft that aircraft were already in
00:40:56.30 --> 00:41:02.94 in flight probably halfway to the liberty and would have driven off the the torpedo attack
00:41:02.94 --> 00:41:10.86 if they had been allowed to continue just to give people some more
00:41:10.86 --> 00:41:18.94 some more context as to what was actually happening for you guys your account fill as this is
00:41:18.94 --> 00:41:26.14 taking place you say this dead bodies were littered everywhere but there were also wounded bodies
00:41:26.14 --> 00:41:30.54 that we knew had to be found and saved if possible between valleys of bullets and rockets we
00:41:30.54 --> 00:41:36.06 darted out from safe cover grab the wounded men wanted a time drag them across the deck and assisted
00:41:36.06 --> 00:41:41.42 them down the hatch others from down below took them from there and moved them to the mess halls
00:41:41.42 --> 00:41:45.98 where they could be treated they took us at least 15 minutes to clear the decks of those who
00:41:45.98 --> 00:41:52.06 were still alive and could be saved about 25 men all together one of the worst cases I saw was
00:41:52.06 --> 00:41:57.18 time Tom Riley a boasts and mate who was on his back and bleeding from multiple wounds and it's covered
00:41:57.18 --> 00:42:02.30 with gray paint which might have saved his life since it became a giant bandage
00:42:02.30 --> 00:42:09.42 so that's the that's kind of the situation that took place where you that's what you
00:42:09.42 --> 00:42:15.02 received the bronze star for was that action going out into into the into the fire to try and recover
00:42:15.02 --> 00:42:21.34 wounded guys you continue here after all the wounded had been recovered I went to the log room
00:42:22.38 --> 00:42:27.98 the location of damage control central I saw and some John D scout there my superior officer
00:42:27.98 --> 00:42:32.70 who is burning documents the standard procedure in US military after briefing him and discussing
00:42:32.70 --> 00:42:36.78 the situation for a few minutes he ordered me to return to the deck to further assess the
00:42:36.78 --> 00:42:41.98 damages and put out any fires that were still burning on the way back I saw many wounded men
00:42:41.98 --> 00:42:46.78 bloody and moaning begging me for help but as I had no medical training there was not much
00:42:46.78 --> 00:42:54.70 I could do to help relieve their pain I got to the bridge and saw a commander at Nagel was badly
00:42:54.70 --> 00:43:01.42 wounded in the leg but still in command rocket and cannon holes were everywhere and burning
00:43:01.42 --> 00:43:07.74 napalm was dripping through the holes into the bridge compartment there were CO2 canisters that
00:43:07.74 --> 00:43:12.54 were not effective in fighting that kind of fire and I requested a team with water hoses but that
00:43:12.54 --> 00:43:17.66 didn't work either since the fire hoses had been shot up just like everything else I told the
00:43:17.66 --> 00:43:22.54 captain that I would return with some better equipment to fight the fires and he calmly replied
00:43:22.54 --> 00:43:29.18 do what you can sailor he was always very professional and stoic even under these incredibly
00:43:29.18 --> 00:43:39.42 violence surreal circumstances so you have napalm dripping through the holes onto the bridge I mean
00:43:39.42 --> 00:43:50.14 that's just crazy to think about it is crazy it is crazy it's a war crime
00:43:50.14 --> 00:43:59.42 dropping it on dropping it on us they wouldn't they they couldn't shoot us up so they tried to burn us
00:43:59.42 --> 00:44:06.22 up and the fire is just basically burn out because we couldn't put them out we didn't have the
00:44:06.22 --> 00:44:14.54 equipment COT CO2 was all gone everything was been had been utilized so it was we could have gotten
00:44:14.54 --> 00:44:21.82 water from the engine room they they could have pumped this water but there was nothing we could do
00:44:21.82 --> 00:44:28.86 with it because the hoses were 99% of our shot up they're all gone and you have that in interaction
00:44:28.86 --> 00:44:36.22 with the captain captain of the conical he sounds like a stoic guy one thing I remember about
00:44:36.22 --> 00:44:40.46 captain of the conical and I remember distinctly is when I was in the pilot house that's where I
00:44:40.46 --> 00:44:47.34 stayed during 99% of the attack and bullets were flying and and and napalm smoking all that stuff
00:44:47.34 --> 00:44:55.18 he was very calmly walking back and forth asking for a cup of coffee he says can I have a cup of coffee please
00:44:56.62 --> 00:45:00.62 she's
00:45:00.62 --> 00:45:10.94 um this is this is just chaos it's chaos put on our part it's organized chaos because we were
00:45:10.94 --> 00:45:16.70 so well trained we knew what we were supposed to do and we did it without thinking that's what
00:45:16.70 --> 00:45:25.42 all the training was for you say this on on my way to the bridge I looked at my good friend
00:45:25.42 --> 00:45:30.38 Francis Brown a third class quarter master who's helping steer the ship he was one of my best
00:45:30.38 --> 00:45:33.90 friends on the ship and we hung out together in better times playing card strength if you
00:45:33.90 --> 00:45:38.70 beers and joking together we just locked eyes and communicated silently that we might not make it
00:45:38.70 --> 00:45:44.70 through this one I went off to find more CO2 canisters and I ran back towards the bridge
00:45:44.70 --> 00:45:48.86 falling in the process which caused the CO2 canister to fly out of my hands and crashed down the
00:45:48.86 --> 00:45:57.74 deck with a bang as soon as I got up I saw that I saw what it caused me to slip and fall
00:45:57.74 --> 00:46:03.10 it was blood on the deck that hadn't been there moments before when I left the bridge it was my friend
00:46:03.10 --> 00:46:08.38 Francis Brown's blood who had caught a machine gun bullet or a piece of shrapnel in the back of his
00:46:08.38 --> 00:46:14.14 head and his blood was everywhere his eyes were closed but his face was swelled up like a balloon
00:46:15.10 --> 00:46:19.34 there was something that no human being should ever have to see especially when it's a good friend of yours
00:46:19.34 --> 00:46:28.54 in a little while after going below deck and seeing more scenes like that I looked like a slaughterhouse
00:46:29.50 --> 00:46:34.22 with a cacophony of wailing and desperation in the background the wounded men kept begging me
00:46:34.22 --> 00:46:37.90 to help them and it was frustrating for me not to be able to do that because I had to move
00:46:38.54 --> 00:46:43.10 them from the passageways into the mess hall so they could get the medical attention they needed
00:46:43.10 --> 00:46:50.46 finally the jet attack was over and I went back to the top deck and then saw Torbito boats coming
00:46:50.46 --> 00:46:57.10 at us at a high rate of speed and now I saw who it was the star of David Flags flying above
00:46:57.10 --> 00:47:01.58 these boats was quite a surprise and at first I assumed they were coming to our rescue
00:47:02.62 --> 00:47:08.86 the delusion only lasted a minute because I then saw the splash of several torpedoes
00:47:08.86 --> 00:47:16.94 that they dropped into the water as they headed towards us did you know they were torpedoes
00:47:17.82 --> 00:47:22.22 I mean did you identify that it seems like that's such a if I would have seen his railie boats
00:47:22.22 --> 00:47:25.42 I thought oh they're friendly oh something just went in the water what could that be did you
00:47:25.42 --> 00:47:29.58 actually know they were torpedoes at that point I did jog because I could see the
00:47:31.02 --> 00:47:37.26 trail in the water oh I saw the two go out I don't know where the other they're fired they're
00:47:37.26 --> 00:47:42.78 say anywhere from five to six torpedoes the general rule is fired but I mean five or six what
00:47:42.78 --> 00:47:49.50 difference is it make now but the two that went after I saw those I didn't I don't know where the
00:47:49.50 --> 00:47:56.14 other ones they could have been after or forward but I do know that one that one did hit and
00:47:57.66 --> 00:48:04.22 that's that's when the ship started listening badly to the star of its side and it just
00:48:04.22 --> 00:48:09.58 looked like this one first and the ship was picked up this is where so so before the torpedo hit
00:48:10.30 --> 00:48:14.22 you say the four torpedoes launched almost simultaneously they had had they hit us the
00:48:14.22 --> 00:48:18.22 liberty would have sunk immediately and the rest of the world history would have been written quite
00:48:18.22 --> 00:48:22.94 definitely those four had miraculously all missed the fifth one was fired and it was immediately
00:48:22.94 --> 00:48:29.10 obvious that it could not be out maneuvered that countdown began we were warned to prepare for a torpedo
00:48:29.10 --> 00:48:33.82 hit and we hunkered down in torpedo attack mode this meant bending your knees and elbows putting
00:48:33.82 --> 00:48:39.34 your hands against the bokeh and relaxing your neck and all of that is made nearly impossible as
00:48:39.34 --> 00:48:44.22 your thoughts of imminent death take over your mind so there was a time period where the fourth
00:48:44.22 --> 00:48:48.70 torpedo launched or sorry the fourth or fifth or whatever it was there's one that you could tell
00:48:49.50 --> 00:48:53.26 that it was going to hit you could you see you could see it in the water coming your way
00:48:53.90 --> 00:48:59.66 no I couldn't see it I was a low decks one deck below the main deck when they counted off on the
00:48:59.66 --> 00:49:06.94 one MC or something yes the captain said prepare for torpedo hit starvation side and
00:49:08.78 --> 00:49:14.14 then we knew there's just a matter of time and it hit and I was thinking to myself
00:49:15.58 --> 00:49:19.98 if this ship goes down I'm going to go down with it because I'm not going to get in the water
00:49:19.98 --> 00:49:26.38 and try to stay alive and let them guys shoot me in the water I'd better go down to ship and that
00:49:26.38 --> 00:49:33.42 was why I intentionally was going down but the ship just just we're actually stopped listing
00:49:36.30 --> 00:49:41.66 how what do you think and Larry as this as you're hearing the countdown comes starbird side
00:49:42.06 --> 00:49:49.98 that's got to be absolutely horrifying it was and we were internal to the ship so I mean we had no
00:49:49.98 --> 00:49:57.26 place to run we were I'd been sitting there our general quarters positions doing our job when you said
00:49:57.26 --> 00:50:04.46 prepare for torpedo attack and we got off our position got ourselves up against the bulkhead
00:50:05.26 --> 00:50:13.34 and squatted down and just brace yourself but you know you're not you never really prepared
00:50:13.34 --> 00:50:21.10 for something like that you just you don't know whether or not it's going to hit right where you're at
00:50:21.10 --> 00:50:30.14 or somewhere else we were above the water line but we were right against the bulkhead that separated
00:50:30.14 --> 00:50:37.82 our calm spaces and our P&R spaces which is the area that the torpedo came into so
00:50:37.82 --> 00:50:49.02 the explosion itself was definitely in for us and like I said we got blown to the overhead
00:50:49.02 --> 00:50:54.30 got concussions and probably the strap no wounds that we received after that
00:50:56.62 --> 00:51:04.06 but you immediately scrambled to your feet to try and help your fellowship mates that are down
00:51:04.06 --> 00:51:12.22 below we didn't know how badly the torpedo damaged that area but when we opened up the hatch we could
00:51:12.22 --> 00:51:18.06 tell you know I mean water was rising and people were scrambling to try and get up the ladder so
00:51:18.06 --> 00:51:27.90 that they could get out but yeah it was nerve-racking absolutely nerve-racking
00:51:27.90 --> 00:51:36.54 to say that we were scared to death I think would be an other statement. Joe when you heard
00:51:36.54 --> 00:51:42.54 brace for torpedo impact where were you what were you thinking. I was on the port wing of the bridge
00:51:42.54 --> 00:51:49.34 looking up make sure the flag was flying and when I heard that brace for torpedo attack I just hit the
00:51:49.34 --> 00:51:57.66 deck and you know not knowing what a torpedo would do I just felt it hit and I was lifted off the
00:51:57.66 --> 00:52:07.42 deck just to instant. Phil you saying the account when the explosion came it was literally
00:52:07.42 --> 00:52:13.50 deafening I'd been directly above the point where it hit only about eight feet away and the explosive
00:52:13.50 --> 00:52:19.26 percussion blew out my ear drums an injury that never completely heals we were all
00:52:19.26 --> 00:52:24.14 instantly airborne because the ship itself was picked up out of the water and then it came back
00:52:24.14 --> 00:52:28.94 down and bounced back up and down a few more times nearly capsizing in the process.
00:52:31.02 --> 00:52:35.74 The new moaning and groaning was not coming from the wounded men but was now coming from the wounded
00:52:35.74 --> 00:52:43.42 ship as the rush of sea water flooded into the ship. Since the ship itself did not blow up
00:52:43.42 --> 00:52:47.98 that meant the torpedo did not hit the engine room because that cold sea water hitting the
00:52:47.98 --> 00:52:51.50 boilers would have caused the ship to be cut in half and both halves would have gone to the
00:52:51.50 --> 00:53:02.22 bottom within minutes. And since Scott instructed me to determine where the torpedo had hit
00:53:02.94 --> 00:53:07.34 so with Rick a mediat my side we went down to the communications spaces where the spooks worked.
00:53:08.22 --> 00:53:13.50 I banged on the steel door with my fire axe since I did not have a code to open it and a voice told
00:53:13.50 --> 00:53:18.54 me that I was not authorized to enter the spaces. Rick and I told whoever was on the other side
00:53:18.54 --> 00:53:23.50 to go to hell saying that we were authorized to go wherever we had to to keep the ship afloat.
00:53:24.30 --> 00:53:27.50 I told the person on the other side that if they did not open the door I would beat it off
00:53:27.50 --> 00:53:34.06 its hinges with my axe. That's a crazy story so these guys freaking the ship got hit with a
00:53:34.06 --> 00:53:39.18 torpedo and you go open up this damn door and they go hey you're not authorized.
00:53:39.18 --> 00:53:49.34 Yeah it was crazy it was really crazy and when we got down there we went to the hatch that he
00:53:49.34 --> 00:53:56.86 closed to make sure everything was watertight and everything and I grabbed a hatch it had two
00:53:56.86 --> 00:54:02.62 different hatches of big one in and a small skull hatch. I opened it up very slowly and I could hear air
00:54:02.62 --> 00:54:08.06 coming out so I do not want to water and I'll be darn two or three other guys for out there
00:54:08.06 --> 00:54:14.46 bang and try to get out and they came out and what a beautiful sight to see in my life.
00:54:17.26 --> 00:54:21.58 Yeah you say suddenly the door opened I went to scuttle hatch to scuttle hatch and turned it
00:54:21.58 --> 00:54:24.94 then opened it very slowly I heard air escaping in our direction which meant that the
00:54:24.94 --> 00:54:30.38 compartment was not completely filled already but was filling. Just as I opened it I heard
00:54:30.38 --> 00:54:34.86 frantic banging on the other side so I turned the wheel as fast as I could and Sergeant Bruce
00:54:34.86 --> 00:54:39.82 Lockwood United States Marine Corps came scrambling out while pulling another sailor safety as well.
00:54:40.54 --> 00:54:44.70 A Median I grabbed the two and yanked them out of the hole and since Scott came up
00:54:44.70 --> 00:54:53.42 carrying a battle lantern and ordered me to give him my belt. I did as he asked and then he used it
00:54:53.42 --> 00:54:59.82 to lower the lantern into the water to look and check for any more signs of life. After a few moments
00:54:59.82 --> 00:55:09.02 we looked at each other and he asked what I thought. Sir I said I think we had better seal her up.
00:55:17.42 --> 00:55:25.74 So that's one of those moments where you know as a leader you got to make a the hardest decision
00:55:25.74 --> 00:55:31.50 that a person could have to make which is we don't know who else is down below we know that this
00:55:31.50 --> 00:55:36.30 this is filling up with water and when we seal this hatch we're sealing their fate but in order
00:55:36.30 --> 00:55:43.02 to save the ship that's the decision they have to make. Absolutely there's a very difficult decision
00:55:43.02 --> 00:55:51.66 but it was pretty instantaneous as soon as that decision was made I mean it was done but with
00:55:51.66 --> 00:55:58.62 wood preerodically go back and check listen but it was all over so Scott didn't have a chance
00:56:00.30 --> 00:56:10.78 it was lucky enough he got out and many more but it was just I mean to think about
00:56:11.58 --> 00:56:15.74 25 your ship makes down there and I didn't know how many got killed at that time down there
00:56:15.74 --> 00:56:24.54 but to think that they went through that and what we went through a bug deck they didn't know
00:56:24.54 --> 00:56:33.18 what was going on below deck they didn't have a clue but like I said earlier these guys
00:56:34.54 --> 00:56:40.86 they didn't abandon their duty stations and what kind of courage is I take to save the
00:56:40.86 --> 00:56:48.94 low decks in the CT spaces on the starboard side and take what they were going to get and they
00:56:48.94 --> 00:56:55.26 did break brave one of them and that's why we're here there are dead ship mates they can't speak
00:56:56.62 --> 00:57:01.34 but we can speak for them and we've been doing that forever trying to get the truth out
00:57:02.06 --> 00:57:08.62 but our government once it's sealed the stay sealed is so disposable now again it's not
00:57:08.62 --> 00:57:16.22 it's not a guess the Jews it's not a guess Americans they just got fed lies and we're here to
00:57:16.22 --> 00:57:21.66 say hey who are I witnesses are you going to believe the Israeli version the board of
00:57:21.66 --> 00:57:28.30 inkware version which is a total BS are you going to believe I witness this like us now I think
00:57:28.30 --> 00:57:32.54 the American public is smart now especially with what's going on in the world now to see that
00:57:32.54 --> 00:57:41.66 how powerful a government can be if they want to silence you it's gotten so bad that the US
00:57:41.66 --> 00:57:49.82 Navy curator and the US Navy historian wrote the official government version of the attack and he
00:57:49.82 --> 00:58:00.70 based it entirely on the Israeli version wow well more people are going to hear here this version
00:58:00.70 --> 00:58:12.30 then that version how you like that go and back to the account now the torpedo boats began firing
00:58:12.30 --> 00:58:17.18 it us with machine guns shooting anything that moved including firefighters and stretcher bears
00:58:18.38 --> 00:58:22.22 one of the guys I was pulling to safety got hit right above the knee with a 50 caliber slot
00:58:22.22 --> 00:58:27.42 causing explosion of blood and bone I took off my shirt and tied the sleeves around the top of his leg
00:58:27.42 --> 00:58:31.02 as tight as I could to stop the bleeding we got him down to the mess decks and untied the
00:58:31.02 --> 00:58:35.34 turnic it for just a few seconds so that they wouldn't be forced to amputate the leg later
00:58:35.34 --> 00:58:40.06 then we retided before leaving the area a median I went back up to the main deck and saw
00:58:40.06 --> 00:58:45.18 that that the gunners on the torpedo boats were now shooting at the ship on the waterline
00:58:45.74 --> 00:58:51.18 aiming in the direction of the boilers and from merely 35 yards away clearly they were trying
00:58:51.18 --> 00:58:55.98 now to blow up the ship by hitting the boilers and causing a huge explosion that their last
00:58:55.98 --> 00:59:01.26 torpedo had failed to accomplish throughout the course the torpedo boat attacked they circled
00:59:01.26 --> 00:59:06.78 the ship like voltiers at as close as a hundred feet to suggest that they might have missed the
00:59:06.78 --> 00:59:13.66 huge lettering on both sides of the bow in ten foot high letters as well as the USS Liberty
00:59:13.66 --> 00:59:16.62 lettering on the stern seems impossible
00:59:16.62 --> 00:59:27.34 and you're sitting there seeing these guys just lay into you with 50 caliber machine guns
00:59:27.34 --> 00:59:32.30 from a hundred yards away yes sir and nothing to fight back with
00:59:33.34 --> 00:59:41.98 the are willing and which and the pleasure of taking another breath is what kept us all
00:59:41.98 --> 00:59:50.38 going and pretty fortunate to be here jacco i saw one of the torpedo boats a lot closer than
00:59:50.38 --> 00:59:55.50 a hundred yards one of the miles on the port wing of bridges I spent a lot of time out there
00:59:55.50 --> 01:00:01.74 making sure the flag was flying and I saw one of the torpedo boats sail very slowly at our
01:00:01.74 --> 01:00:08.86 port support side I didn't see him fire anything but I did notice the crew on the on the torpedo
01:00:08.86 --> 01:00:14.94 boat motion up to the signal bridge up to that area so they can see the flag and then they just
01:00:15.98 --> 01:00:23.18 sail off and continue to attack how much time had passed between the initial
01:00:23.98 --> 01:00:31.18 strafing runs from the aircraft to the torpedo attack and is this an hour has gone by two hours
01:00:31.18 --> 01:00:35.82 or approximately two hours some people save more some people probably say less
01:00:35.82 --> 01:00:44.06 but to do that type of damage and in a few moments like these really said it just took a
01:00:44.06 --> 01:00:50.22 little while they only said they had only three aircraft that attacked us and there was
01:00:51.34 --> 01:00:57.98 probably twenty aircraft so to attack us to do that kind of damaging that's for the time it's just
01:00:57.98 --> 01:01:07.02 when you think back three airplanes can't carry the munitions would take to put over eight hundred
01:01:07.02 --> 01:01:13.34 fifty cannon rocket holes in the ship drop napalmons and just it doesn't make sense
01:01:15.98 --> 01:01:21.10 so as all this is going on you say all of the sounds of these machine guns and the sheer
01:01:21.10 --> 01:01:26.06 hell taking place might have been the reason why there was some controversy of whether commander
01:01:26.06 --> 01:01:32.62 mechanical ordered all crew prepared to abandon ship but I heard that order probably because
01:01:32.62 --> 01:01:36.22 he felt that there was no possibility at that point we could save the ship
01:01:42.14 --> 01:01:46.46 he was probably not aware yet that nearly all the life boats were either destroyed by
01:01:46.46 --> 01:01:51.10 rockets gunfire napalm that there were only three left and I personally put one of them into the
01:01:51.10 --> 01:01:56.38 water as I watched all three and flate only to see them immediately shot up two sank but one of
01:01:56.38 --> 01:02:01.90 them was taking a board one of the boats as a trophy that capped the series of horrors I witnessed
01:02:01.90 --> 01:02:06.30 that day and told me as clearly as anything else that the purpose of the attack was not just
01:02:06.30 --> 01:02:10.86 to cripple the ship and take it out of commission so that it could not ease drop on communications
01:02:10.86 --> 01:02:16.14 but to actually sink our ship the active destroying our life boats was an unmistakable
01:02:16.14 --> 01:02:22.86 sign that they wanted no survivors left to tell anyone what had happened Lord Painter testified
01:02:22.86 --> 01:02:27.66 about that he he witnessed the machine gunning of the life rafts and he testified about that during
01:02:27.66 --> 01:02:33.02 the US Navy Court of Inquiry but if you get a copy of the Court of Inquiry his test of money has
01:02:33.02 --> 01:02:41.26 been removed not redacted removed from the record what do you think and when you hear a band
01:02:41.26 --> 01:02:48.94 and ship what are you thinking about Larry did you hear that call I did I was had a secondary
01:02:49.90 --> 01:02:58.46 duty station at that point our our fan tail phone talker had taken a rocket hit
01:02:58.46 --> 01:03:05.90 seriously wounded and he was down in the dispensary I was back on the fan tail as a phone
01:03:05.90 --> 01:03:13.98 talker I had a first-class petty officer Jeff Carpenter saw me getting some fresh air while
01:03:14.70 --> 01:03:21.82 puddle behind a a wench and he said bo and go back and be the phone talker and
01:03:23.90 --> 01:03:31.34 I saw the torpedo boats and when I heard this skipper say you know prepared to abandon ship
01:03:31.34 --> 01:03:39.10 I was I was sinking to myself you know I mean this this is it you know I mean there the right
01:03:39.10 --> 01:03:45.58 there are they I can shoot every one of us in the water you're trying to decide whether or not
01:03:45.58 --> 01:03:52.94 you you've got a chance of jumping overboard and and swimming for or going down with a ship like
01:03:52.94 --> 01:04:00.70 Phil talked about and of course I stood my ground and waited but that was about the same time that I saw
01:04:01.98 --> 01:04:08.46 under that and a fried aircraft approaching from the starboard side and it was helicopter
01:04:10.06 --> 01:04:16.22 and they were coming out at that point to find out whether or not we had any casualties whether
01:04:16.22 --> 01:04:25.42 or not they can provide any kind of assistance and so obviously we didn't have to have been
01:04:25.42 --> 01:04:34.62 in ship but you know you scared the death again you don't know you've got nowhere to run
01:04:35.34 --> 01:04:45.42 I mean we were like ducks in a barrel and I just opened fire and you know we we had no
01:04:45.42 --> 01:04:53.26 way to defend ourselves and you guys mentioned this already but just to just to reiterate
01:04:54.22 --> 01:04:59.42 there was some heroic activity to place for people for some of your shipmates to get
01:05:00.14 --> 01:05:04.94 onto the deck of the ship and string up a long wire antenna and send out an SOS message
01:05:04.94 --> 01:05:10.30 and that actually made it to to six feet which was you know like I talked earlier about big
01:05:10.30 --> 01:05:16.06 groups of ships and you guys traveled solo but normally the US Navy travels and big groups of ships so
01:05:16.06 --> 01:05:21.34 that was the six fleet is one of these big groups of ships had an aircraft carrier and whatnot
01:05:21.66 --> 01:05:28.78 and they actually received the SOS that you guys were on travel under attack and and talk me through
01:05:28.78 --> 01:05:35.98 about what you know about how that how the response the rescue response got shut down
01:05:35.98 --> 01:05:47.02 very good question we didn't learn quite a while exactly why it went forward but
01:05:50.54 --> 01:06:00.70 it just seemed like nobody really cared about us you know nobody
01:06:00.70 --> 01:06:05.74 sued in the present he's the one that got a visit this mess L.B.J. State L.B.J.
01:06:07.58 --> 01:06:15.90 and his minions but I never thought I never thought that the greatest fighting force in the
01:06:15.90 --> 01:06:21.26 world would leave this behind but they didn't they they wanted to come help us that's why
01:06:21.26 --> 01:06:25.90 Captain Tully got fired they took his command away because he immediately launched aircraft out was
01:06:25.90 --> 01:06:33.98 but twice and he was a captain Tully was someone on the US S.R. Toga they received the signal
01:06:33.98 --> 01:06:39.26 that you all were in trouble and he said okay we got sailors in trouble we got US Navy ship in
01:06:39.26 --> 01:06:45.02 trouble we're gonna go help him and he launches aircraft to go help yes before they even before they
01:06:45.66 --> 01:06:53.90 left the horizon the ship they would recall back thanks to L.B.J. and McNamber
01:06:53.90 --> 01:07:01.10 and I believe that we've set up from the Gidgo I don't know if it was a year before six months
01:07:01.10 --> 01:07:12.62 before whatever but the front let's say 15 was all about six five six the June 15th I mean
01:07:12.62 --> 01:07:18.78 yeah six of June on the 15th day the war response to start but they started early that's why
01:07:18.78 --> 01:07:25.66 they rushed this out of out of avidjan to get to the area just as fast as we could I mean
01:07:25.66 --> 01:07:31.42 that whole ship was still in this fast it was shaken we had they took the governor's off the
01:07:31.42 --> 01:07:39.74 engines and we were on our way flying but everybody was apprehensive we how we didn't even know
01:07:39.74 --> 01:07:44.94 from the radio signals I mean what was going on the Middle East but there was a war going on
01:07:44.94 --> 01:07:49.98 here we go and we look out and here we are and sailing up and down the coast like we usually
01:07:49.98 --> 01:07:54.70 did in Africa that was our only position in Africa was just sail up and down the coast and
01:07:54.70 --> 01:08:02.46 collect intelligence like everybody else does but when we got on scene and you could see as Joe
01:08:02.46 --> 01:08:11.10 Manchard before the black smoke coming up from from the attacking forces is rules going into
01:08:11.10 --> 01:08:19.10 the sign I it was I thought what Jesus man I'd hate to be over there I'd never knew it was
01:08:19.10 --> 01:08:26.38 coming to us and we were the intended target to sink in my view and I think a lot of other guys
01:08:26.38 --> 01:08:34.86 too is sink it I blame it on NASA and World War III they're broken out because the Russian
01:08:34.86 --> 01:08:45.82 suffers they're ready to ready to nuke Israel and they our government sent bombers to bomb
01:08:47.66 --> 01:08:55.66 the Arab states and never recalled within seconds of a catastrophe of a nuclear war
01:08:55.66 --> 01:09:06.46 yeah so I read that as well that we had launched nuclear weapon armed aircraft as a response to
01:09:06.46 --> 01:09:14.38 what was happening and then those got recalled as well yes sure exactly if you look at the
01:09:14.38 --> 01:09:22.62 this tactics used by the Israelis during the attack they started with unmarked aircraft or
01:09:22.62 --> 01:09:28.30 they jammed our radios on both US Navy tactical and international maritime distress frequencies
01:09:28.30 --> 01:09:34.14 they used unmarked aircraft they used the napal on the drive the ships crew down below
01:09:34.14 --> 01:09:40.38 decks brought interpeeta boats to with six torpedoes total luckily only one hit and then he
01:09:40.38 --> 01:09:48.30 labored assault troops it was obvious to me and most people that their intention was to sink the
01:09:48.30 --> 01:09:58.94 ship and kill old any survivors speaking of that the the he-low-born assault troops here we go
01:09:58.94 --> 01:10:04.94 shortly after the boats left the scene from far off in the distance but closing in fast came the
01:10:04.94 --> 01:10:10.22 unmistaker will want want want want sound of a very large troop carrying helicopter approaching the
01:10:10.22 --> 01:10:17.82 ship on the starboard side now the one MC system blared all ships personnel prepared to rebel
01:10:17.82 --> 01:10:24.30 repel borders so now after all other weapons were brought to bear on our ship and failed the
01:10:24.30 --> 01:10:29.42 sinker we were about to be bordered by Marines armed with sub machine guns after the only
01:10:29.42 --> 01:10:35.66 machine guns on the ship had been destroyed in the wave of first attacks even if we could get to
01:10:35.66 --> 01:10:39.98 them in time the only other guns we had on the ship were small arms pistols and a couple of
01:10:39.98 --> 01:10:45.42 shot guns that we might use to set up a last line of defense a median eye tried to open the
01:10:45.42 --> 01:10:51.02 locker with our fire axes since our master at arms who is the only one with a key was not to be found
01:10:51.90 --> 01:11:00.30 even after beating that lock nearly pieces we could not break it the commandos on board the helicopter
01:11:00.30 --> 01:11:05.50 above appeared to be ready to repel on to our ship ready for close quarters combat with a bunch of
01:11:05.50 --> 01:11:11.82 defenses for drag-led sailors worn out from two hours of sustained attacks it would have been a
01:11:11.82 --> 01:11:17.58 turkey shoot but we were not to about to go down without a fight for our lives had they proceeded they
01:11:17.58 --> 01:11:21.74 could have murdered the entire crew and then proceeded to use whatever explosives they had to
01:11:21.74 --> 01:11:28.06 guarantee the ship's destruction as the helicopter hovered overhead no more than 75 feet away
01:11:28.06 --> 01:11:34.06 I locked eyes with one of the Marines these are Israeli Marines who is sitting on the floor of the
01:11:34.06 --> 01:11:39.18 helicopter his legs were hanging out he had one foot on the skid below as he waited for an order
01:11:39.18 --> 01:11:45.18 to repel down to the ship's deck and finish us off as I stood on the deck of my bloody and
01:11:45.18 --> 01:11:49.90 battered ship I thought about everything that had happened over the course of that afternoon
01:11:49.90 --> 01:11:55.58 about my good friends Francis Brown and David Skolack and all the other men whose remains were
01:11:55.58 --> 01:12:02.30 strewn all over the ship the only two-eyed left was my middle finger and I used it to let him know
01:12:02.30 --> 01:12:12.70 what I thought of him in the rest of his team he simply gave me a smile and returned the gesture
01:12:17.26 --> 01:12:23.66 and then they they backed off right that's they they didn't land they they flew away
01:12:23.66 --> 01:12:34.22 they just took they just took off york on it was it was a victory for us our first victory of the whole
01:12:35.10 --> 01:12:40.14 mess that was they're not coming aboard because they could they could have easily in fact they
01:12:40.14 --> 01:12:46.14 could come back that night and got us and for some reason they didn't do it because they could have
01:12:46.14 --> 01:12:52.46 gotten by with it very easy all the kids of ship broke apart the Israeli said that Derib's did it
01:12:52.46 --> 01:12:56.86 and I think we better go get to your I think we better just go get them that's just that was the
01:12:56.86 --> 01:13:03.50 whole is a land grab for Israel and in a power grab for LBGA to keep these war machine going in
01:13:04.14 --> 01:13:15.98 Vietnam and it's not like you guys got helped quickly you say this it's 18 hours a hell
01:13:15.98 --> 01:13:20.14 to call it a long night is a big understatement none of us slept for two reasons first we
01:13:20.14 --> 01:13:23.82 were afraid of the dark not like little kids but rather because we knew that criminals
01:13:23.82 --> 01:13:27.90 prefer the cover of darkness when doing their dirty work those responsible for the previous
01:13:27.90 --> 01:13:34.54 days attack might return to the scene of the crime to finish what they had failed to do earlier
01:13:35.34 --> 01:13:39.82 second we didn't know if the ship would even stay together although we were not sure of the
01:13:39.82 --> 01:13:45.90 exact size the whole in the starboard side we knew that it was big very big it was a lot of work
01:13:45.90 --> 01:13:50.54 that wouldn't be needed just to keep the ship afloat and moving away from the dangerous zone
01:13:50.54 --> 01:13:54.86 and with all the men killed or wounded only a skeleton crew remained to do this
01:13:56.86 --> 01:14:02.14 those of us who did survive were glad of that of course but we all felt an enormous amount of
01:14:02.14 --> 01:14:08.70 survivors guilt why me why us we asked ourselves silently why had we been spared while others had not
01:14:10.06 --> 01:14:14.22 the dead included two of my good friends Francis Brown who shot in the head with a 50
01:14:14.22 --> 01:14:20.22 caliber machine gun round and his brain splattered all over the bridge and David Skolok who had
01:14:20.22 --> 01:14:24.46 who had been with just minutes before the attack he was also called the machine gun fire
01:14:24.46 --> 01:14:29.58 and had been blown to pieces too many to count I went to the mess deck to see if I could help with
01:14:29.58 --> 01:14:35.58 the severely wounded men as soon as I entered the sheer mass of human suffering moved me so much
01:14:35.58 --> 01:14:42.54 to emotion that my knees got weak but I dared not let it show as I went from broken man to
01:14:42.54 --> 01:14:49.18 broken man asking what I could do to help him feel more comfortable what was the total ship's crew
01:14:49.82 --> 01:14:58.94 294 two says the crew is either wounded or dead what were you doing throughout the night
01:14:58.94 --> 01:15:04.86 Larry a little bit of the same to fill was just talking about one to the mess decks to
01:15:04.86 --> 01:15:15.10 help relieve the corpsman wheel ahead one ships officer you know the skip of the doctor
01:15:15.10 --> 01:15:22.62 is the doctor doctor key for and and then two corpsmen a second class and a third class per
01:15:22.62 --> 01:15:31.02 the officer so I'm an eagle scout I had some first aid background not that it was going to
01:15:31.02 --> 01:15:37.10 do much for some of the maimed bodies that were laying there in a mess decks but like Phil said
01:15:37.10 --> 01:15:46.46 you're there to try and comfort them and you know just just talk to him I was actually
01:15:47.82 --> 01:15:55.58 providing some kind of an ointment to their wounds you know the corpsman would give me something
01:15:55.58 --> 01:16:03.02 and say go you know wipe this wound here or whatever and so I was doing that
01:16:05.18 --> 01:16:12.30 didn't get any sleep that night I think the main reason was I wanted to stay awake in case something
01:16:12.30 --> 01:16:19.02 happened and that that bulkhead gave way because we would have had a band and ship as quickly as
01:16:19.02 --> 01:16:31.74 we could I still have my life fast son I wasn't going to give that up but I was I was not alone
01:16:31.74 --> 01:16:39.82 I mean there were a lot of us walking wounded I was I was wounded but I didn't realize that I had
01:16:39.82 --> 01:16:48.06 the strap and the wounds in my thigh because you're adrenaline is pumping so so fast that and you're
01:16:48.06 --> 01:16:57.26 taking care of others so I had blood from trying to take care of John Spicer and you know working
01:16:57.26 --> 01:17:04.22 with some of the other wounded that my my dongries were just kind of blood soaked and I didn't find
01:17:04.22 --> 01:17:10.86 out until I don't know I guess a day or two later when one of the doctors from one of the other
01:17:10.86 --> 01:17:17.50 ships was up in the dispensary and they were you know evaluating us to determine whether or not
01:17:17.50 --> 01:17:24.94 we'd sustained any injuries and of course I had a drop trial when he said how did you get those
01:17:24.94 --> 01:17:32.78 you know scars on your leg there and strap no wounds I said I don't know I was to bend
01:17:32.78 --> 01:17:41.98 there in the torpedo attack but as far as working through the night we did whatever we could to
01:17:41.98 --> 01:17:48.86 try and you know keep keep everyone calm it wasn't chaotic I mean they weren't there might have
01:17:48.86 --> 01:17:54.78 been some mone in here and there but it wasn't a lot of screaming and yelling or anything like
01:17:54.78 --> 01:18:03.66 that everybody realized hey there's still alive and we're gonna get out of this we kept thinking
01:18:03.66 --> 01:18:11.42 that we're gonna get some support but nothing ever came. What about you Joe what were you doing
01:18:11.42 --> 01:18:15.58 throughout that night throughout that night does the signal when I was up on the signal bridge
01:18:15.58 --> 01:18:25.50 looking for ships and if it's someone might be coming to help you either way and if I saw a
01:18:25.50 --> 01:18:32.70 light moving along in the sky I don't care how high I but was I always had my little all disflashing
01:18:32.70 --> 01:18:38.62 lamp and tried to signal it I knew it was futile but I had to try it because all the other
01:18:38.62 --> 01:18:47.82 signal lights are in this right. Going back to the account here from you Phil as I was doing this
01:18:47.82 --> 01:18:53.02 commander Philip Armstrong the ship's executive officer called my name I thought that his condition
01:18:53.02 --> 01:18:58.30 was critical but he was active in alert and seemingly in little pain he asked me for a cigarette
01:18:58.30 --> 01:19:03.26 so I lit one and put one in his mouth form he asked me many questions about the number of dead
01:19:03.26 --> 01:19:10.06 and wounded and the captain's condition while I heard the agony of the men all around us. I left him
01:19:10.06 --> 01:19:14.86 for a few minutes to try and find anything to help comfort the men and by the time I returned
01:19:14.86 --> 01:19:19.90 to check on commander Armstrong to my great shock and sadness I found that he had just died.
01:19:21.90 --> 01:19:27.42 Then I went to the wardrobe the mess hall for the officers there I saw another one of my friends
01:19:27.42 --> 01:19:33.90 Clary Bent Gary Blanchard and listed Seaman who's front showed no signs of wound but he was lying
01:19:33.90 --> 01:19:40.14 in a puddle of his own blood that seemed to be getting bigger by the second. He asked me to
01:19:40.14 --> 01:19:46.46 remove his socks because his feet were on fire I did as he asked then he asked if he was going to
01:19:46.46 --> 01:19:54.94 make it I could do no more than shake my head no. I always hated myself for not lying to him
01:19:54.94 --> 01:20:01.58 or at least ignoring the question and changing the subject but I did hope that my response allowed
01:20:01.58 --> 01:20:09.26 him the chance to make peace with his maker before the final curtain. These four men were among
01:20:09.26 --> 01:20:13.98 the nearly three dozen killed that day many of whom I'd never gotten a chance to know.
01:20:16.38 --> 01:20:21.42 I had met the ship's doctor I had met the ship's only doctor there in the wardrobe
01:20:21.42 --> 01:20:28.06 Dr. Richard Kifer I'm saying that right Kifer Kifer he came over and began to operate on Gary
01:20:28.06 --> 01:20:33.66 however quickly became clear that it was too late as soon as he opened him up he then
01:20:33.66 --> 01:20:39.42 had to put stitches in him to hold him together before Doc moved on to his other numerous
01:20:39.42 --> 01:20:45.66 patients all of whom desperately needed his attention. If anyone aboard that ship
01:20:45.66 --> 01:20:57.82 deserved the congressional metal varner it was Doc Kifer. As time went on we went about
01:20:57.82 --> 01:21:01.74 our regular duties now modified because of the precarious condition of the ship we were still
01:21:01.74 --> 01:21:07.74 unsure why we'd been attacked and by whom is Rayleigh flags have been seen on that least one boat
01:21:07.74 --> 01:21:12.54 and the helicopters but the thought that our friend and ally would do something so treacherous
01:21:12.54 --> 01:21:18.78 was unthinkable but nothing was normal anymore and that thought was the only possible explanation
01:21:19.58 --> 01:21:24.86 the brutality intensity and long duration of the attack and the obvious fact that they wanted to kill
01:21:24.86 --> 01:21:32.78 us all and sink the ship had become quite clear to all of us. Why else would they destroy our only
01:21:32.78 --> 01:21:40.14 means of escape by shooting up our lifeboats? As I began to resume my regular duty sounding
01:21:40.14 --> 01:21:45.58 security and damage control I realized that my heroic shipmates had saved the ship that day
01:21:45.58 --> 01:21:51.74 by remaining at their posts wall under the attack. I started making my usual rounds which now
01:21:51.74 --> 01:21:58.46 included both bulkheads encompassing the CT spaces where the torpedo had hit. The walls made from
01:21:58.46 --> 01:22:04.30 plate steel no more than an inch thick if that were sweaty from the cool ocean water on the other
01:22:04.30 --> 01:22:10.46 side. I could even hear the water sloshing around knowing that if the bulkheads ever gave way we would
01:22:10.46 --> 01:22:17.42 all be gongers. There were cracks in the steel walls caused by the enormous pressure being
01:22:17.42 --> 01:22:24.06 exerted against them by the Mediterranean Sea. They were ballooning outward from that pressure
01:22:24.06 --> 01:22:28.54 and I feared that the cracks would get larger and larger until they finally would give way.
01:22:28.54 --> 01:22:34.70 They looked like they were alive and breathing as they heaved in and out with the movement of
01:22:34.70 --> 01:22:40.62 the ship and the pressure of the water. I got shivers standing in such close proximity to them knowing
01:22:40.62 --> 01:22:45.26 that the only thing standing between me and my own death was a plate of steel that was ready to
01:22:45.26 --> 01:22:52.30 come crashing into the boiler room at any second. That thin steel wall was the only thing keeping
01:22:52.30 --> 01:22:56.70 the sea water from flooding into the interior of the ship and if that happened the ship would have
01:22:56.70 --> 01:23:01.82 immediately sunk from a huge explosion when the cold water hit the hot boilers.
01:23:07.18 --> 01:23:13.18 So you're looking at the wall of the ship. You know on the other side of this wall and these
01:23:13.18 --> 01:23:19.82 are like interior walls that aren't meant for the pressure of the external sea. You can see them
01:23:19.82 --> 01:23:27.42 bowing from the pressure. They're like balloons just bowed out, cracks in the bottom on the sides
01:23:28.22 --> 01:23:32.86 and water was coming through not a lot. I mean just sweating more less sweating.
01:23:35.34 --> 01:23:40.94 But we got help finally from the U.S. as Davis and Massey and the Davis Food coming aboard
01:23:42.30 --> 01:23:48.06 and gave us greatest assistance and great help in securing the ballcats with
01:23:48.06 --> 01:23:59.74 wood and plywood. It was a new wall. Press up against the bulkhead and you had to check it out
01:24:00.38 --> 01:24:06.30 every half hour 45 minutes. If I went on watch my other shipmates would go through there
01:24:07.50 --> 01:24:14.14 and get under there. Like I did with a battle liner and look, I thought to myself,
01:24:14.14 --> 01:24:20.14 why this is pretty stupid. What am I going to do? If it fuzz over now and I'm here looking
01:24:20.14 --> 01:24:25.82 from the cracks, it makes sense to me but I had to do it. And your boilers are still running this
01:24:25.82 --> 01:24:30.70 whole time. Yes sir, boilers were never taken off line one was taken off line but we always had
01:24:30.70 --> 01:24:36.22 steamed as well as always at least one boiler. What direction were you sailing in? Do you even know
01:24:36.22 --> 01:24:39.58 where were you trying to go? The worst I think. Pardon me. I mean were you trying to get to the
01:24:39.58 --> 01:24:46.86 fleet? Were you trying to do? Yeah I think once the attack started, I think we took a northernly course
01:24:46.86 --> 01:24:54.14 trying to get out of there might have even been a north-westernly course trying to get away from
01:24:54.70 --> 01:25:02.54 this just get away from that whole area. Exactly. But obviously we couldn't move fast enough to
01:25:02.54 --> 01:25:10.46 get away from you know, screaming jets and older torpedo boats. I mean flight speed for us was
01:25:10.46 --> 01:25:17.42 what? 17 knots? I think we did 21 knots during the speed to speed drowder. Yeah, yeah, from
01:25:17.42 --> 01:25:25.18 Abbie and Dorota. Oh okay. So it was the USS Davis and the USS Massey that eventually showed up.
01:25:25.18 --> 01:25:29.10 Were you there on this looking form when they showed up? Oh yeah I saw him come out of the
01:25:29.10 --> 01:25:44.94 morning mist. 16 hours later. How that feel? Pist? Where were you? And what was the look on the faces?
01:25:44.94 --> 01:25:49.58 The guys when they would they put just prolonged side to you guys? Yeah. One of them, well,
01:25:49.58 --> 01:25:54.62 initially they sent boats but I think the Davis actually tied up alongside us for a while.
01:25:54.62 --> 01:26:05.66 And what were those sailors? They were in damage control and they had more equipment than we did.
01:26:05.66 --> 01:26:14.78 And to be quite honestly, they had more expertise and they were in shock but they
01:26:15.98 --> 01:26:20.86 they knew what they were doing and God bless them for that. They helped us out a lot but they
01:26:20.86 --> 01:26:28.22 lived with these guys for so good dust and it wasn't a Navy's fault. It was the higher apps
01:26:28.22 --> 01:26:33.42 like I said before because these guys, I mean they felt bad. They could have been, they could have helped us.
01:26:34.46 --> 01:26:43.74 The captain asked for escort, a DE or a destroyer, anything but you're not a warship,
01:26:43.74 --> 01:26:49.34 you're not a X-Lerieship. Nobody's going to mess with you and so they did not even that just
01:26:49.34 --> 01:26:57.90 having escort. It going into a war zone with an unarmed ship. I mean it's pretty incredible.
01:26:57.90 --> 01:27:02.70 That's why I know that in my heart and I think my ship may probably agree to that
01:27:05.42 --> 01:27:10.54 we were set up to have this exact thing happen. The only thing is they couldn't sink us.
01:27:11.26 --> 01:27:16.22 They sure tried but they couldn't do it. And that by the grace of God, we're here right now
01:27:16.22 --> 01:27:22.70 to be on your great show and to have your listeners take a look at this because we're not a
01:27:22.70 --> 01:27:27.34 cabal, we're not conspiracy, we're not anything. We're just American citizens that served our
01:27:27.34 --> 01:27:34.70 country honorably to tell the truth and we'll go down that way to the last man's standing.
01:27:35.34 --> 01:27:40.70 We're not going to take this. We haven't taken it for so many years. Joe was the first president
01:27:40.70 --> 01:27:49.10 of the LVA. He was in Saudi Arabia. He worked for Ramco and he was a president long distance.
01:27:49.10 --> 01:27:58.86 Remember that Joe? Yeah. And it was pretty amazing but I just give all the credit to the great
01:27:58.86 --> 01:28:03.98 crews. He's wonderful man here and I love them all and I'm proud to be in American.
01:28:03.98 --> 01:28:11.02 But I got to say one thing at this point in my life, Jockel, I'm not, I've always been proud of my
01:28:11.02 --> 01:28:16.46 country. Now I'm not right now because I'm ashamed of what's going on, the leadership and
01:28:17.74 --> 01:28:25.18 it reminds me of back in 67, the same type of leadership. Cancer culture just didn't start with
01:28:25.18 --> 01:28:31.66 these people. It started a long time ago in 67. They tried to cancel us out but they couldn't do it.
01:28:31.66 --> 01:28:39.34 I've had threats to my life. A lot of things have been made of my life for a sandy ego visiting
01:28:41.18 --> 01:28:46.94 and I was in the lounge. I have a drink from my wife. Get ready to go get something to eat.
01:28:47.74 --> 01:28:53.26 In this guy I set beside me and he says, oh, you're aboard the liberty and I said,
01:28:54.62 --> 01:29:00.06 how do you know that? And he began to tell me the whole story and the best thing for me to do is
01:29:00.06 --> 01:29:08.14 he shut up. I said, what? He says, listen, I work for the massage, I'm a massage agent and you
01:29:08.14 --> 01:29:15.18 better shut up my wife was there too and bored to she give him hell. They had to get security
01:29:15.18 --> 01:29:21.98 to get us up to our room. But I asked the bartender, I said, who is it guy? Well he's been coming
01:29:21.98 --> 01:29:27.02 here last couple of days and he said he was a doctor. He said he told me to, and it'd be great
01:29:27.02 --> 01:29:31.42 being watch on. I told him, get the watch out of my face. You're taking pictures from me or whatever you're
01:29:31.42 --> 01:29:37.50 doing and he's just probably but I gave you another warning and that's what my wife jumped in and
01:29:38.38 --> 01:29:44.54 I think she gave me more heck than I did because she said she's a fighter too but it was
01:29:45.18 --> 01:29:54.22 it was amazing and how did they find out who we were in San Diego either by my credit cards
01:29:54.22 --> 01:30:00.70 or phone or something. I don't know but they found us and gave me a stern warning and that was
01:30:01.90 --> 01:30:10.94 13 years ago when that happened. One thing should be said about the six-fleet personnel,
01:30:10.94 --> 01:30:18.54 their radioman didn't come out of this unscathed because they listened to our calls for help after
01:30:18.54 --> 01:30:26.30 the aircraft recalled knowing that those aircraft were recalled and it had to affect them because
01:30:26.30 --> 01:30:40.62 we were still calling for help. I mean just in case anyone has anyone doesn't have the impression of
01:30:40.62 --> 01:30:46.22 what happened on this ship. Let me go back to the account here as this sort of wraps up one
01:30:46.22 --> 01:30:51.90 of your final duties. Phil you say Rick a Mediani found some undamaged firehots as began
01:30:51.90 --> 01:30:57.90 hoising off the deck with a suicide nozzle that sprayed water and very concentrated high pressure
01:30:57.90 --> 01:31:03.26 stream. It took both of us to handle this hose because it was like a giant python and one man could
01:31:03.26 --> 01:31:11.18 not do it alone. It was the most gruesome heartbreaking task either of us had ever done because
01:31:11.18 --> 01:31:19.58 every piece of flesh was the remains of our fellow sailors many of whom were friends. As a Mediani
01:31:19.58 --> 01:31:26.38 went about this ungodly task, tears streamed down our faces and I prayed to God for forgiveness
01:31:26.38 --> 01:31:33.98 for how we were forced to treat the remains of these men. In the guntubs we found a shoe with a
01:31:33.98 --> 01:31:41.50 foot still in it which we put aside for collection. Many of the blood stains would not come off even
01:31:41.50 --> 01:31:47.26 with that special hose because the previous day's intense heat not just baking under the sun's
01:31:47.26 --> 01:31:53.58 heat but from the rockets and napalm that had been dropped on the ship by the attacking aircraft.
01:31:53.58 --> 01:32:03.58 We found out the hard way how hot this brutal weapon can burn as hot as 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit.
01:32:23.90 --> 01:32:35.26 So, the Davis, they also start taking some of your wounded off. Is that correct?
01:32:36.62 --> 01:32:42.62 I'm not very clear on that, you're not going to go for sure but I do know that the most seriously
01:32:42.62 --> 01:32:54.46 wounded were airlessed off the ship from the US and America and the Davis and the Massey were
01:32:54.46 --> 01:33:03.10 I guess more or less there to help us out. But I don't take any of the evacuees at what
01:33:03.10 --> 01:33:18.54 it was. So they did start pulling the wounded guys off. And then you guys end up
01:33:18.54 --> 01:33:26.70 sailing to Malta. That's the next thing that you do. You get to the ship stays underway and again
01:33:26.70 --> 01:33:31.90 you got some good stuff in your account. Just that trip is no easy trip because the walls
01:33:31.90 --> 01:33:38.86 are could collapse at any moment and it's not the closest. Oh it's not the closest spot. No.
01:33:39.66 --> 01:33:45.42 Where would have been the closest spot? What would the free free free free free free? Why did they pick
01:33:45.42 --> 01:33:54.46 Malta? Hope when we'd sink? If it's further away doing a four four nost five nostops, how many days
01:33:54.46 --> 01:34:02.54 it take you to get there? Six or seven days. Yeah, seven days. Yeah it was and then I was probably
01:34:03.34 --> 01:34:09.42 probably already know this but that Admiral Kidd. I think it's another reason they sent us to Malta
01:34:09.42 --> 01:34:15.50 because he wanted to brief us all and get our account of what went on. Yeah I've got your account
01:34:15.50 --> 01:34:21.58 of how that goes down. That's very interesting and actually I got another account from Ron Koukou
01:34:21.58 --> 01:34:25.42 and I said that right. Yes. Ron Koukoukou and he's one of the survivors. He's actually the guy
01:34:25.42 --> 01:34:31.50 that helped put this interview together. He did. He's got a book that's called Remember The Liberty
01:34:32.14 --> 01:34:37.90 that he wrote and he had this to say about the events once you guys arrived in Malta. He said
01:34:37.90 --> 01:34:42.62 on arrival in Malta we were headed straight to dry dock and once we were in it was up to the great
01:34:42.62 --> 01:34:49.18 crew at Malta to get us set up for repairs and whatever else needed to be done. What never occurred to
01:34:49.18 --> 01:34:54.86 me was the grizzly duties that we were that were about to be laid squarely on our shoulders. In my
01:34:54.86 --> 01:34:59.74 case as a senior enlisted man on the crew I was putting charge of recovery and identification.
01:35:00.46 --> 01:35:05.10 I would admit I tried to talk my way out of this one but I was told those from my orders and I followed
01:35:05.10 --> 01:35:10.70 them. That hour arrived sooner than I wanted as we made our way down to the dark hole below.
01:35:11.58 --> 01:35:15.50 No one knew it to expect and I was extremely apprehensive about what we could see.
01:35:15.50 --> 01:35:22.30 For 48 years I've said a little about what I saw because I wanted to spare the loved ones
01:35:22.30 --> 01:35:30.38 of these men. That cruelty if I could. With the writing of this book and in the distance in years
01:35:30.38 --> 01:35:35.34 I think I can at least say that the scene could compare to a wrecking yard of autos.
01:35:37.02 --> 01:35:43.42 But these were human body parts strewn everywhere. Carnage that escapes description with mere words.
01:35:43.42 --> 01:35:49.66 And there were more bodies that were down below which were brought to me to try and identify.
01:35:49.66 --> 01:35:54.06 Those bodies were wedged between steam pipes and in places that a body wouldn't fit.
01:35:56.78 --> 01:36:03.18 If it's any consolation to the loved ones of those men know that they never knew what it hit them.
01:36:03.18 --> 01:36:15.42 They couldn't have it had to have been instantaneous.
01:36:15.42 --> 01:36:19.58 Once you're in multi time for this investigation this investigation is being run by
01:36:19.58 --> 01:36:29.50 Admiral Isaac Kid. Actually Admiral Isaac Kid Jr. The senior Isaac Kid, Admiral Isaac Kid, was
01:36:29.50 --> 01:36:39.82 killed in Pearl Harbor. His son Jr. was commissioned 12 days after his father was killed and
01:36:39.82 --> 01:36:44.86 he served in Europe in the Pacific Theor's World War II. He was the guy in charge of this
01:36:44.86 --> 01:36:50.30 liberty incident inquiry. As you already mentioned I mean you'd think an incident like this
01:36:50.30 --> 01:36:56.30 just to gather the proper information would take months and then to go through it all would take
01:36:56.30 --> 01:37:03.50 months if not years to get through it all. They get this whole thing done in seven days.
01:37:03.50 --> 01:37:13.42 Yes sir and you know Dr. Keyford very eloquently said why would the United States government take
01:37:13.42 --> 01:37:23.58 on faith with the Israeli said when they muscled us I witnessed his never to say a word about it
01:37:23.58 --> 01:37:31.26 or consequences could be very very very severe prisoner worse we all know what worse meant.
01:37:31.26 --> 01:37:35.50 I was told that directly by Admiral Kid. That's the strange thing so Admiral Kid
01:37:36.14 --> 01:37:39.74 shows up tanks off his rank. Yes sir. And what's he a two star at this point?
01:37:41.10 --> 01:37:45.02 Yeah he was a rear was he a red arrow. So he's a two star out of
01:37:45.02 --> 01:37:50.46 Maltax office rank and since you guys down asked you all a bunch of questions hey did you see any
01:37:50.46 --> 01:37:55.26 markings on the recon aircraft did you did you see any markings on the other aircraft did you see
01:37:55.26 --> 01:37:59.50 the torpedo boat boats were there any markings on the torpedo boats did you see the the
01:37:59.50 --> 01:38:05.10 did you see the torpedo boats machine gunning the life rafts are you sure the US flag was flying
01:38:05.10 --> 01:38:11.98 over the ship so he's asking you all these questions and and at the end of asking all these questions
01:38:13.34 --> 01:38:19.34 he puts his stars back on and he says okay fellas now I'm an Admiral again and I want each and
01:38:19.34 --> 01:38:24.54 every one of you to understand something we are talking about national security here not your
01:38:24.54 --> 01:38:29.98 personal feelings not what you did or did not do I could really give a shit about any of that you
01:38:29.98 --> 01:38:34.62 listen to me once because this is the only time you're ever gonna hear it you are never
01:38:35.26 --> 01:38:42.14 to repeat what you just told me to anyone not your mother your father your wife anyone
01:38:42.14 --> 01:38:49.98 including your shipmates you are not to discuss this with anyone and especially especially not
01:38:49.98 --> 01:39:01.02 with the media or you will end up in prison or worse you know I I took that to heart when I first
01:39:01.02 --> 01:39:09.50 met Lisa be 39 years we got married ago got married in June and I never told her I was in the
01:39:09.50 --> 01:39:16.94 military at all until I read an article by Stan White he was a master chief of board the ship
01:39:17.90 --> 01:39:24.46 and it was like an ocean of relief came out for me I said wow somebody else was saying
01:39:24.46 --> 01:39:30.70 something now I can start talking little bit I know these guys here just set up the US has
01:39:30.70 --> 01:39:35.82 literally veterans association which I became a part of as soon as I found out you guys were
01:39:35.82 --> 01:39:42.54 were you know getting together and it's been a concept about ever since we were in the
01:39:42.54 --> 01:39:50.30 rose garden W. H. Bush was a president and we were out there for hours and scorching heat you
01:39:50.30 --> 01:39:56.06 know it is in DC what were you doing there were you invited to be there as as vets of the
01:39:56.06 --> 01:40:03.74 liberty to me the president you guys stationed he stiffness he wouldn't talk to us so he sent out
01:40:03.74 --> 01:40:13.74 rescue property and what year was it that that article came out that you said what year did you
01:40:13.74 --> 01:40:19.74 guys start talking about what had actually happened when you managed to book him out salt on the
01:40:19.74 --> 01:40:27.02 liberty and what year was that so in the night yeah so you guys just kept it to yourself for
01:40:27.02 --> 01:40:33.02 whatever twelve or thirteen years not saying anything yeah who would we talk to I mean
01:40:34.06 --> 01:40:39.98 everybody was spread out all over the country we didn't know where any of the survivors were
01:40:39.98 --> 01:40:44.38 did you make any sense of it in your own minds did you think yourself well I could see why they're
01:40:44.38 --> 01:40:48.14 trying to do this they don't want to have you know bad relations with this real they're trying to
01:40:48.14 --> 01:40:53.50 cover up the the fact that the American government was somehow involved with this I mean what
01:40:53.50 --> 01:40:57.90 were you thinking in your own minds I was thinking that they'd already held an investigation and
01:40:58.94 --> 01:41:04.38 and everything was copacetic but to come to find out they have never investigated it matter
01:41:04.38 --> 01:41:09.66 fact that court of inquiry was ordered by lbjada have a finding the fact they're very first one
01:41:09.66 --> 01:41:15.58 that the attack was a case of mistaken identity that's where lbj said yes that's what the word
01:41:15.58 --> 01:41:21.26 Boston said okay he was ordered he was a legal advisor yeah I got a quote here from a word
01:41:21.26 --> 01:41:27.18 Boston who's the chief legal counsel for the US Navy Court of Inquiry and he says quote I know from
01:41:27.18 --> 01:41:33.82 personal conversations I had with Admiral Kid president of the court of inquiry that president
01:41:33.82 --> 01:41:39.82 Lyndon Johnson and secretary of defense Robert McNamara ordered him to conclude that the attack
01:41:39.82 --> 01:41:46.38 was a case of mistaken identity despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary end quote
01:41:46.38 --> 01:41:55.82 and that's the chief legal counsel to the Navy Court of Inquiry to the Liberty incident this isn't
01:41:55.82 --> 01:42:01.26 somebody that's jumping in from some other you know some other realm to try and give his opinion
01:42:02.06 --> 01:42:10.86 well you know word Boston was a good man a very brave man for coming out
01:42:10.86 --> 01:42:19.10 and and setting the record straight but there were there were people before him trying to help us
01:42:19.10 --> 01:42:25.90 you know all around but when AJ Crystal wrote a book called the Liberty incident that said he
01:42:25.90 --> 01:42:31.82 won fire because it was a book of lies and he couldn't take it anymore he said I'm gonna stick
01:42:31.82 --> 01:42:35.90 up to these guys and tell the truth what did the book what did the book the Liberty incident say
01:42:35.90 --> 01:42:41.18 it said that it was a it's a it's a really talking point in an American talking point it was a mistaken
01:42:41.18 --> 01:42:48.38 identity we're not the part of a bunch of just hardened fools that have got to act to grind
01:42:48.38 --> 01:42:53.82 hardly act to grind is to tell the truth that's why we're here we're not here to to lie or
01:42:53.82 --> 01:42:58.30 fabricate or anything like that we live through it and we don't want anybody else to go through that
01:42:58.30 --> 01:43:03.50 ever again it has a government of vandal you know same tending off a canister
01:43:03.50 --> 01:43:10.14 and they left everybody there and it almost the 13 people got 13 American heroes it got
01:43:10.14 --> 01:43:17.02 slaughtered for what forgotten and that was what we were forgotten it's done it's too late
01:43:18.54 --> 01:43:23.18 Larry when did you start here in that people were starting to tell the truth about the situation
01:43:24.46 --> 01:43:32.38 again it was a Jim and a spoke assault on the Liberty I read the book but I was still on active duty
01:43:32.38 --> 01:43:40.22 and I still had my top secret clearance and so I wasn't saying anything to anybody and
01:43:41.18 --> 01:43:50.86 as it turns out after I retired from the Navy in 1986 I I went to work as a defense contractor
01:43:51.58 --> 01:43:58.70 still supporting the national security agency so I still needed my clearances so I never said anything
01:43:58.70 --> 01:44:06.62 I never really started talking about the Liberty to my family or anyone else until I
01:44:07.34 --> 01:44:18.70 started going through PTSD psychiatric you know treatments so I knew that there were other books
01:44:18.70 --> 01:44:25.90 out I know that Phil had two or three books at Hevero the one that you referenced earlier about
01:44:25.90 --> 01:44:36.62 Ron and Cookele Phil's also a contributor to that book and Ernest Gallo is another member of the crew that
01:44:37.26 --> 01:44:45.18 helped you know with that how long were you in the Navy for 21 years you get a purple heart for being wounded on
01:44:45.18 --> 01:44:50.70 I did and what would you tell people when some other you know you're out you're you're just whites for whatever
01:44:50.70 --> 01:44:58.30 reason and you know 1975 there's guys were in Vietnam sure some you know guys there's some
01:44:58.30 --> 01:45:02.38 it's corpsmen some medics some pilots some aviators might have got purple hearts some some
01:45:02.38 --> 01:45:07.18 guys from the sea wolves or something but there's not a lot of navy guys running around in 1975
01:45:07.18 --> 01:45:12.38 1980 1985 that had purple hearts what did you say to somebody when they said hey where did you get that
01:45:12.38 --> 01:45:20.46 purple heart from I was on the U.S. a celebrity in 1967 when we were attacked and you know I got it
01:45:20.46 --> 01:45:27.90 for Shrept and wounds and that was about it you know and no one would ever pry and say you know what
01:45:27.90 --> 01:45:34.22 the hell happened to what was going on how how that occur oh I I think a couple of times you know
01:45:34.22 --> 01:45:42.54 people would try and and pry more out of me and I just wouldn't say anything I said I just can't talk
01:45:42.54 --> 01:45:51.34 about it and again it was because of the threat of fines and imprisonment if we ever spoke about it
01:45:53.18 --> 01:46:01.02 being being a communications technician all of my work that I did was secret so trying to keep a secret
01:46:01.66 --> 01:46:10.78 wasn't wasn't something that was new to me I just suppressed it to the point that um it was building
01:46:10.78 --> 01:46:17.50 up inside me and finally I had to go to counseling and did you still have your clearance?
01:46:18.70 --> 01:46:26.30 no when I when I retired in 2008 I relinquished my my clearance they didn't take it away
01:46:26.30 --> 01:46:34.78 that you didn't relict it I just decided I was 62 years old it's it's time to pull the plug
01:46:34.78 --> 01:46:44.70 uh as you were serving in the navy now it's 1975 now it's 1979 now it's 1982 and you know that
01:46:46.14 --> 01:46:50.94 you know you know you got ordered to not say anything which look I mean there's things that I've
01:46:50.94 --> 01:46:55.58 done which I'm not allowed to talk about right you realize okay I might not know everything about the
01:46:55.58 --> 01:47:00.70 situation but I know I'm not allowed to talk about it but I'm sure that there's a reason for that
01:47:00.70 --> 01:47:08.62 that makes sense and I get it you know was part of you thinking you know this is not this this
01:47:09.50 --> 01:47:14.54 this didn't happen the way they say it happened this seems like they're covered it up not for any
01:47:14.54 --> 01:47:21.98 reasons of national security but for other reasons yes I mean I because I work for the national
01:47:21.98 --> 01:47:31.42 security agency they actually did a report in 1980 that was classified top secret um and it was
01:47:31.42 --> 01:47:41.02 their recap of what happened to the US's liberty I had a copy of that report on my desk until I
01:47:41.02 --> 01:47:48.54 retired from the navy in in 1986 um and then I had to turn it back in because it was you know
01:47:48.54 --> 01:47:58.14 what that report accurate no no and I mean there was information that I knew should have been in there
01:47:58.14 --> 01:48:05.18 that had to deal with communications that that didn't reflect those communications and
01:48:06.54 --> 01:48:13.18 the thing that they were trying to report more than anything else was a lack of communications
01:48:13.18 --> 01:48:22.62 that occurred resulting from this hundred mile um free zone I guess that Israel had declared
01:48:23.26 --> 01:48:34.06 no no ship should enter into that hundred miles zone off the coast of Sinai and apparently
01:48:34.06 --> 01:48:43.10 our naval atoshae and um and Israel had told them that we don't have any navy ships there
01:48:43.90 --> 01:48:51.50 six fleet confirmed that they didn't have any any naval ships there and that's you know a problem
01:48:51.50 --> 01:48:58.70 with us traveling by ourselves that they they they didn't recognize that we were over there or
01:48:58.70 --> 01:49:06.70 they conveniently forgot that we were there but there was communications that were supposed to have
01:49:06.70 --> 01:49:12.86 been sent us telling us to move back off the coast and we never received those communications
01:49:12.86 --> 01:49:19.42 and so that's more about what this report from NSA said and it didn't talk about the other
01:49:20.54 --> 01:49:26.70 intercepts that had you know the aircraft talking to ground control we're talking about the
01:49:26.70 --> 01:49:34.46 target talking about seeing the American flag and you know I don't know why that didn't
01:49:34.46 --> 01:49:40.62 come out until later but we kept doing a freedom movement information act requests trying to get
01:49:41.34 --> 01:49:47.42 a lot of this documentation back out in the public so the truth could be told
01:49:48.46 --> 01:49:53.58 so Joe what did you do after the incident so place how much longer were you in the navy
01:49:53.58 --> 01:49:59.26 for did you stay and what did you do I got out I was transferred off the liberty onto the USS
01:49:59.26 --> 01:50:08.22 Solvenia so it was AFS 2 fast combat stewardship and the home ported in in Naples Italy
01:50:08.94 --> 01:50:15.74 and it was a very active signal bridge one of the most active in the six fleet at the time
01:50:15.74 --> 01:50:24.78 and so I go from a singleman school to a ship that doesn't need a signalman to a ship that
01:50:25.42 --> 01:50:32.62 has a very very intense signalman but after that I went I got out
01:50:33.50 --> 01:50:40.38 Halloween on 69 and same question to you I mean were you thinking to yourself what's one of the
01:50:40.38 --> 01:50:45.34 reasons you got out because you're thinking hey this crazy thing just happened to me I lost
01:50:45.34 --> 01:50:51.42 so many of my friends and now I'm told I can never talk about it again did that impact the way you
01:50:51.42 --> 01:50:58.94 thought about your career interesting thing about that um on this Elvenia there was a uh
01:50:59.82 --> 01:51:05.10 career counselor and every time you were getting short you would call you in this office and give you
01:51:05.10 --> 01:51:10.86 a long-speel about why you should trip over and stay in the navy so he didn't know he didn't know me
01:51:10.86 --> 01:51:18.14 personally and they didn't know my history so he called me into his office sat down and he said as
01:51:18.14 --> 01:51:25.18 well-metters you're getting short you're thinking about shipping over and I said no and he said why
01:51:25.18 --> 01:51:33.82 it's because I was on the liberty and he said goodbye yeah Roger that Phil what was the rest of your
01:51:33.82 --> 01:51:42.46 career like well I joined February the 6th and got out December the year yeah 64 now get out
01:51:42.46 --> 01:51:49.90 December the 12th 1967 I stayed out for a couple of years and I wasn't going to ship both
01:51:49.90 --> 01:51:58.78 Reather because I was done but then uh you know here I'm I'm 22 then or 23 and I say man I'm not
01:51:58.78 --> 01:52:03.82 my life's not going anywhere I'm not doing anything sorry I read a lesson what back then navy and it
01:52:03.82 --> 01:52:11.58 got stationed for the US as Maddox he just uh 731 that was in the talking dog talk that's how
01:52:11.58 --> 01:52:17.34 the Vietnam War started and some of the original crewmates were still on there it said hey turning
01:52:17.34 --> 01:52:23.90 that that never happened that's all BS it was a pretext for war they Johnson dreamed up and it
01:52:23.90 --> 01:52:36.70 turned right back around to the US has a liberty another pretext phony outcome to keep his war machine
01:52:36.70 --> 01:52:46.70 going to Vietnam and it's a land grab for Israel and a permanent foothold in the area for the United
01:52:46.70 --> 01:52:53.90 States so you when you got to the Maddox and they're talking about those attacks those you know
01:52:54.70 --> 01:53:00.86 supposed attacks and the guys would say I didn't happen yeah no I didn't happen in the way it
01:53:00.86 --> 01:53:06.38 worked and I told a couple of guys about their you know my situation my
01:53:09.42 --> 01:53:14.94 division officer he read my file and this is when I was getting out and he says hey man
01:53:14.94 --> 01:53:25.18 maybe you should get out I wasn't I wasn't really into it but I thought well maybe I
01:53:25.18 --> 01:53:32.38 can tough it out you know made a few bucks while I was in the service but that's how I was
01:53:32.38 --> 01:53:36.54 feeding my family with your lucky to be transferred to the star can then the call
01:53:36.54 --> 01:53:47.02 the um as this call as this cover up continues I got another statement here this is from
01:53:49.58 --> 01:53:54.38 this is from Lieutenant General Marshall S. Carger director of the NSA
01:53:55.26 --> 01:54:01.26 under who's authority the liberty was operating he said couldn't be anything else but deliberate
01:54:01.26 --> 01:54:08.06 there's just no way you could have a series of circumstances that would justify this being an accident
01:54:08.06 --> 01:54:14.70 you know as my friend Darrell Cooper pointed out when this attack happens once an international
01:54:14.70 --> 01:54:22.62 lodge an even convention when a when a naval vessel gets disabled you're then as the attacker
01:54:22.62 --> 01:54:28.22 responsible for trying to help lend aid to that ship and certainly the sailors that are that are
01:54:28.22 --> 01:54:34.62 in the water if they're in the water you're not supposed to be gunning up their lifeboats and
01:54:34.62 --> 01:54:40.78 strafing their their the decks of their ship as they're already disabled vessel so this is just
01:54:40.78 --> 01:54:44.70 wrong and every circumstance and you know I was talking before we started recording this you know I've
01:54:44.70 --> 01:54:55.50 been in friendly fire incidents before um in pretty bad ones where people died and I totally understand
01:54:55.50 --> 01:55:00.78 that there's the fog of war that these things happen that that that you make mistakes and someone
01:55:00.78 --> 01:55:04.94 sees something that they didn't think they saw or someone saw something that they didn't think they see
01:55:04.94 --> 01:55:11.90 and there's all things that there's a lot of chaos that happens but to have that happen for
01:55:11.90 --> 01:55:18.62 hours upon hours when there's an American flag flying you know and and you know Joe that was
01:55:19.26 --> 01:55:23.82 again this is something else we were joking about when you're off air you know since you were
01:55:23.82 --> 01:55:29.02 a single men with no other ships to signal to you really had one job and that was to know what
01:55:29.02 --> 01:55:35.50 was flying what the ship was flying and you know 100% that that that that the American flag was
01:55:35.50 --> 01:55:40.78 clearly visible and that you actually ended up raising an even bigger American flag that's right
01:55:43.18 --> 01:55:51.90 you know I might add to that uh jacco the uh is really war room had his plotted on their map
01:55:51.90 --> 01:55:59.66 as American and friendly they said they changed the watch and inadvertently forgot we were there
01:55:59.66 --> 01:56:06.62 and took us off their war table I mean come on man you know when you when you change watches
01:56:06.62 --> 01:56:14.06 you you inform everybody of what's going on and they just took it all the way and that's uh still
01:56:14.06 --> 01:56:18.22 it or it takes me I know because he's guys too yeah and by the way there's no more important
01:56:18.22 --> 01:56:22.94 piece of information on the battlefield than where your friendly forces are yes sure so this isn't
01:56:22.94 --> 01:56:27.90 like we oh well whatever you know we're just gonna pull some people off the board no that's that's a
01:56:27.90 --> 01:56:35.74 synth and people focus on the flying of the flag was it flying was it not flying but that's really
01:56:36.38 --> 01:56:41.34 that's not that's just one of the ways of identifying a ship you know it's there's the color
01:56:41.34 --> 01:56:48.30 the structure how the the deck is laid out you know the the masks and all that stuff and they
01:56:48.30 --> 01:56:54.70 claim that they approached within the thousand yards and miss identified it says a 40 year old black
01:56:54.70 --> 01:57:06.62 hull the russed out Egyptian tramp steamer half our size jacco Tony Hart
01:57:06.62 --> 01:57:11.74 then a chief pedi officer assigned to a US Navy relay station in Morocco that handled
01:57:11.74 --> 01:57:16.62 communications between Washington and the sixth fleet remembered listening as defense
01:57:16.62 --> 01:57:24.06 secretary Robert McNamara in Washington ordered rear admiral Lawrence Geiss commander of the
01:57:24.06 --> 01:57:30.62 America's carrier battle group to bring the jet's home when Geiss protested that the liberty was
01:57:30.62 --> 01:57:37.34 under attack and needed help Hart said McNamara retorted that president Johnson is not going
01:57:37.34 --> 01:57:50.54 to go to war or embarrass an American ally over a few sailors end quote that's a violation of article 99
01:57:50.54 --> 01:58:00.46 of the UCMJ it is indeed it is indeed yes article 99 of the UCMJ you have to go out and attack
01:58:00.46 --> 01:58:04.54 the enemy and you have to go out and support your other troops that's article 99 yes
01:58:10.30 --> 01:58:16.78 statement by CIA director at the time of the attack Richard Holmes in a 1984 interview
01:58:16.78 --> 01:58:22.46 he said everything possible is done to keep from the American public really the enormity of this
01:58:22.46 --> 01:58:28.94 attack on an American naval vessel since this is for the agency's record I don't think there can be
01:58:28.94 --> 01:58:34.62 any doubt that the Israelis knew exactly what they were doing any statement to the effect that they
01:58:34.62 --> 01:58:46.62 didn't know it was an American ship is nonsense I mean that's that's pretty freaking clear
01:58:46.62 --> 01:58:58.78 you guys got a bunch of awards for you know for what took place including the Medal of Honor
01:58:58.78 --> 01:59:11.58 Captain McConnell received the Medal of Honor for for his actions which is strange to take the story
01:59:11.58 --> 01:59:18.06 of someone receiving the Medal of Honor not explained what happened that was covered up in an
01:59:18.06 --> 01:59:22.94 naval shipyard that's where he received these Medal of Honor and shipyard not it's a White House
01:59:22.94 --> 01:59:29.50 where he can be recognized for being the skipper of our ship and getting the Medal of Honor
01:59:29.50 --> 01:59:37.26 because it brings too much heat on and unfortunately I think the captain was between a real rock
01:59:37.26 --> 01:59:45.74 in a hard place on one hand he can be treated like a hero on the other hand he can we can be treated
01:59:45.74 --> 01:59:52.22 like a Z-Roll and he went with hero I'm not saying he didn't deserve it I'm just saying that
01:59:52.22 --> 01:59:57.34 he clamped up and it was years and years later I wanted a year later he finally said well yeah
01:59:57.34 --> 02:00:03.58 I think it was a it was a plan to tag that was I think there's a copy of his retirement speech
02:00:03.58 --> 02:00:07.90 you can watch it online I've watched it and I think it was his retirement speech where he says
02:00:08.62 --> 02:00:12.06 hey we need to find out that we need to tell the truth about what actually happened
02:00:12.06 --> 02:00:18.30 yes sir he wouldn't even join the LBA I tried for years to get him to join but he says it's too
02:00:18.30 --> 02:00:25.42 political for him to get involved and finally he did join the association after years and years
02:00:27.02 --> 02:00:28.06 which were a vodice
02:00:28.06 --> 02:00:36.30 Dean Ross who is secretary the state at the time said I was never quote I was never
02:00:36.30 --> 02:00:41.34 satisfied with his Rayleigh explanation there's sustained attack to disable and sink liberty
02:00:41.90 --> 02:00:47.02 precluded and assault by an accident or some trigger happy local commander
02:00:47.74 --> 02:00:52.22 through diplomatic channels we refuse to accept their explanations I didn't believe them then
02:00:52.22 --> 02:01:01.26 and I don't believe them now the attack was outrageous you know some of the things that you already
02:01:01.26 --> 02:01:06.46 talked about there's a there's a BBC documentary called Dead in the Water it's it's it's
02:01:07.58 --> 02:01:12.06 you know one of the things that it said is what you said earlier Phil which is hey if the
02:01:12.06 --> 02:01:18.22 is Rayleigh's could get the Americans into this war in a big way you know that can really help us out
02:01:18.22 --> 02:01:24.14 against these Arabs is what is Rayleigh was thinking and these kind of things happen
02:01:30.54 --> 02:01:34.70 what is what do you guys do with the LBA now what's what's the purpose
02:01:35.58 --> 02:01:41.90 how can people help well one of the things that we're still trying to do is get recognition
02:01:41.90 --> 02:01:48.78 for our 34th fall in shipmates we've tried over the years to get Congress to
02:01:49.82 --> 02:01:54.62 conduct a fallen impartial investigation and it's fallen on deaf ears
02:01:56.30 --> 02:02:05.98 right now we've got a resolution going forward to the ask for June 8th to be
02:02:05.98 --> 02:02:16.70 declared as a US celebrity remembered stay it should be a fairly simple thing for Congress to
02:02:16.70 --> 02:02:24.54 do I mean we have national hot dog day in national you know ice cream day let's have a
02:02:24.54 --> 02:02:36.14 national US as Liberty remembered stay and not just one year but every year June 8th right
02:02:37.58 --> 02:02:42.22 so we're working on that I've got a resolution in the state of New York going through the
02:02:42.22 --> 02:02:51.98 American Legion up there to have that presented through their channels I'm in a process of doing it
02:02:51.98 --> 02:03:02.62 a state of Maryland I'm working with a former senator Pete McClusky to get a petition out
02:03:03.58 --> 02:03:09.58 to get signatures for people that will support the establishment of June 8th is US
02:03:09.58 --> 02:03:17.18 a celebrity remembered stay and then present that to various legislators to show them that
02:03:17.18 --> 02:03:27.82 hey the American public wants to know they need to know and you know if nothing else you're
02:03:27.82 --> 02:03:35.66 you're honoring the 34 men that gave the ultimate sacrifice back on June 8th 1967
02:03:36.54 --> 02:03:43.34 when when you talk about some of the awards that were received most every one of us that received
02:03:43.34 --> 02:03:49.82 any kind of an award purple heart or prom star you know the Congressional Medal of Honor
02:03:49.82 --> 02:03:57.66 it was all done in private there were no big ceremonies like you would normally expect for you know
02:03:57.66 --> 02:04:03.98 someone with that just came off the most decorated ship in the United States Navy since World War
02:04:03.98 --> 02:04:16.30 II and you know 95% of the American public is not even aware but you know Jacob he said
02:04:16.30 --> 02:04:25.34 something very interesting about the American Legion which fires me up because about four or five years
02:04:25.34 --> 02:04:33.10 ago Len Hall of the and Ernest Gallo our former president we're at the convention in the
02:04:33.10 --> 02:04:39.82 American Legion and they're wanted to get a booth and things like this and they wouldn't allow it
02:04:40.86 --> 02:04:48.62 for us to get a booth so Len Hall of the he was so disappointed and upset he tore up his American
02:04:48.62 --> 02:04:56.06 Legion card right there and he didn't throw it in anybody he just sprinkled it right there and the
02:04:56.06 --> 02:05:03.02 girl said one of the organizers he assaulted me and they threw his ass in jail
02:05:04.70 --> 02:05:10.94 well I wouldn't they let you have a booth because they said the US has liberty is non
02:05:12.22 --> 02:05:18.30 is not essential we don't recognize you guys and don't ever come back because you're banned from the
02:05:18.30 --> 02:05:26.54 American Legion for life this is from their national convention it's still in effect today
02:05:27.90 --> 02:05:34.14 that we can't have a booth when he's talking about Ernie and and Len going to that
02:05:34.78 --> 02:05:41.74 national convention they went there with the understanding that we had already paid our $1,000
02:05:41.74 --> 02:05:48.78 entry fee and they got there and we're told that they hadn't received the check and they hadn't
02:05:48.78 --> 02:05:56.94 received the check so Ernie pulled out his credit card and said I'll pay for it right now we're here
02:05:56.94 --> 02:06:02.78 we're we want a booth and they said no you can't do that and then I think it got to be somewhat
02:06:02.78 --> 02:06:14.22 confrontational and that's when you know Glenn got upset tore up his membership card and
02:06:16.06 --> 02:06:23.42 we've tried in vain since then to get senior management in the American Legion national
02:06:23.42 --> 02:06:31.10 organization to reinstate us so that we can have a booth there that's how we tell our story that's how
02:06:31.10 --> 02:06:38.78 we get other patriots to you know go back to their home states and say hey let's let's try and do
02:06:38.78 --> 02:06:45.74 something and support of the U.S. celebrity I wrote up a couple of years ago resolutions for every
02:06:45.74 --> 02:06:53.34 state in the union this was done at the VFW national convention and I had a representative
02:06:53.34 --> 02:07:00.94 from from each state take one of these resolutions back for their legislators to consider an
02:07:00.94 --> 02:07:12.78 introduced in their state legislator. and I don't know that anything ever came of it and that's
02:07:12.78 --> 02:07:20.78 the problem with a lot of this trying to get people to stand up and say hey if you want our
02:07:20.78 --> 02:07:26.62 support will support you just like your audience today if there's people out there that are willing
02:07:26.62 --> 02:07:34.30 to you know pick up the torch and run with it I'll be more than happy to write up a resolution for
02:07:34.30 --> 02:07:41.10 any organization that they have and and ask them to support the establishment of the
02:07:41.74 --> 02:07:48.30 June 8th U.S. celebrity remembered today. Do you guys have a website? Yes. And what's that?
02:07:49.02 --> 02:07:54.46 U.S. celebrity veterans.org. I think you take care of that Josh J.
02:07:54.46 --> 02:07:59.98 And I know actually it's we have a webmaster for it. Okay. That the one I take care of is U.S.
02:07:59.98 --> 02:08:08.38 celebrity veterans.org. Yeah. Yeah. To donate anybody out there wants to help the celebrity
02:08:08.38 --> 02:08:13.18 veterans continue on doing what we're doing. We're a small organization now a lot of the guys have
02:08:13.18 --> 02:08:21.42 already passed on you know the older guys we just lost the commander loose he was 92 I think. Yeah.
02:08:21.42 --> 02:08:27.66 And he just died this year and a good man a brave man he's he's also in a sacrifice and
02:08:27.66 --> 02:08:33.10 liberty I think you're really going to get a good insight of what went on Jocco because it is
02:08:33.90 --> 02:08:38.14 sacrifice and liberty to me is probably the most interesting
02:08:40.38 --> 02:08:46.46 truthful documentary that's ever been done in my view. Now I think you was probably free.
02:08:46.46 --> 02:08:52.78 Yeah I would. It's you've got I witnessed accounts being taken into account
02:08:53.58 --> 02:09:01.18 through through the four different you know one hour disk so it's it's not a quick breed you
02:09:01.18 --> 02:09:07.66 got to get a devote some time to it but it's certainly well worth going through it and
02:09:07.66 --> 02:09:17.26 hearing from probably what a half a dozen or so of us survivors and
02:09:19.02 --> 02:09:24.78 true news that are an excellent job and that just can't say enough about how they
02:09:26.62 --> 02:09:33.82 did their research not just with with us but with other authors and
02:09:33.82 --> 02:09:45.34 I guess senior politicians so that it's a most factual account that I'm aware of.
02:09:47.34 --> 02:09:51.02 Yes it's a resource of iRiser and a unique position in the American history and
02:09:51.02 --> 02:09:59.10 US Navy history where the only crew in US Navy history that has the task of lobbying
02:09:59.10 --> 02:10:08.46 the deal D and Congress to investigate at hack on our ship and we don't have any experience at that
02:10:09.50 --> 02:10:16.30 we don't know anybody who does but we need help from people who do we love to have a
02:10:17.50 --> 02:10:23.26 professional approach and and offer his services we can't bear him we don't have any money
02:10:23.26 --> 02:10:32.46 but we need professional help in lobbying and in the legal arena we don't know if
02:10:33.50 --> 02:10:38.54 I don't know if if there's any legal steps we can take we were in military we were
02:10:38.54 --> 02:10:43.90 it was our job to to go where we're supposed to go and do we're supposed to do
02:10:43.90 --> 02:10:49.58 whether we're civilians on the ship too. Do you guys feel like there's been progress
02:10:49.58 --> 02:10:56.14 towards getting the truth out there because to me I mean when I hear about the US
02:10:56.14 --> 02:11:03.02 Liberty now I immediately kind of most people know sort of the underlying story that it was
02:11:03.02 --> 02:11:10.54 an attack it was from Israel that you know the US Navy lost a bunch of sailors they don't necessarily
02:11:10.54 --> 02:11:15.42 know how many but do you guys feel like there's progress been made in the story getting out there
02:11:15.42 --> 02:11:22.14 in the truth getting out there there's progress being made but not to the extent that people who can
02:11:22.14 --> 02:11:28.78 do something about it do something about it so what is it that what would be the the win what
02:11:28.78 --> 02:11:34.46 would be victory for you all. I'm sitting in the mines winter circle right now with you doing
02:11:35.50 --> 02:11:40.14 I feel like a winner and I think these two gentlemen feel the same way and I want to mention my
02:11:40.14 --> 02:11:43.98 shipmates they all know about this and I'm sure they're going to download this and watch it
02:11:43.98 --> 02:11:51.98 but a special thanks you know to Moshefer and his wife Donna he's the money man he takes care of the
02:11:51.98 --> 02:11:59.50 money no we have and they have a ship story you can buy things from and it's just
02:11:59.50 --> 02:12:07.34 our way of trying to give them to get back the real story and in the last three or four years
02:12:07.34 --> 02:12:13.98 Jockel we've been more progress and we have in the last 55 because of sacrificing liberty and
02:12:14.78 --> 02:12:21.10 now here we are with you and possibly Jill Rogan is going to get a call from you and say hey you've been
02:12:21.10 --> 02:12:29.26 a get these boys on. I could try and I think that's a long list of people try to go on
02:12:29.26 --> 02:12:36.46 I'm Mr. Rogan's podcast I can guarantee you that. Well the win for me is a congressional
02:12:36.46 --> 02:12:43.18 investigation okay complete and comprehensive redundant to be sure but it needs to be said
02:12:43.90 --> 02:12:51.66 congressional investigation but that's a two-edged sword because members of Congress have refused to
02:12:51.66 --> 02:13:01.18 investigate the attack on our ship. War crimes is the US statute. Accessory after the fact is the US
02:13:01.18 --> 02:13:09.02 statute. So members of Congress who were in a position to conduct an investigation refused to
02:13:09.66 --> 02:13:16.22 despite being lobbied by victims of those war crimes might stand accused of being
02:13:16.22 --> 02:13:21.02 accessories after the fact and I don't think accessories after the fact is covered under
02:13:21.02 --> 02:13:28.54 congressional immunity. So there's some scared yeah Congress people out there there's no statute
02:13:28.54 --> 02:13:34.62 limitations on murder and none and that's what happened. The murder these men and try to murder us.
02:13:34.62 --> 02:13:41.10 I mean you know I call the FBI's CIA and I tell him hey I'm like I witnessed a murder and they get
02:13:41.10 --> 02:13:46.54 all excited. Did I tell him what is all about? There's a little bit of that's not it's never
02:13:46.54 --> 02:13:51.26 mind that's what you've been investigating. We've never had an investigation except the
02:13:51.26 --> 02:13:56.86 the phony board of inquiry and we get letters back from Congress somewhere in the earth that I brought
02:13:56.86 --> 02:14:03.82 to show you there's been multiple investigations so there's never been none to align to us where I
02:14:03.82 --> 02:14:10.14 witness is to what happened and they're telling us that we've been it's been a congressional investigation
02:14:10.14 --> 02:14:14.70 at least three or four times or it's never been a congressional investigation. They lied to us
02:14:14.70 --> 02:14:24.06 but do you think they're telling American people? Probably a good place to wrap it up I mean that
02:14:24.06 --> 02:14:27.82 that sounds like we know what we want to do to move this thing forward with the Congressional
02:14:27.82 --> 02:14:33.18 investigation get the word out there. Let's make due-nate you know National Day of Remembrance
02:14:33.18 --> 02:14:43.34 for the USS Liberty Larry just any closing thoughts from you? No I just encourage your listeners to
02:14:45.42 --> 02:14:52.86 you know take what we've said today and if they have any interest at all and trying to support
02:14:52.86 --> 02:15:01.74 the Liberty go to our website contact us you know our contact information is on the website
02:15:02.46 --> 02:15:12.94 and like I said I'm willing to draft resolutions or petitions whatever they want
02:15:12.94 --> 02:15:20.46 for their organization to get signatures to take before their legislators and trying to get support
02:15:20.46 --> 02:15:29.10 for this recognition for our fallen ship rates that should have happened 55 years ago.
02:15:31.50 --> 02:15:38.78 Indeed on our blog there's a USS Liberty veterans dot blog there's a tab that says I
02:15:38.78 --> 02:15:44.22 think it's help us out and in that tab or a series I think four letters you can write to
02:15:44.22 --> 02:15:51.74 you can just fill in the blank and submit one is calling for have a member of Congress send you
02:15:51.74 --> 02:15:57.98 a copy of the Congressional investigations and they can't do it one is asking them to contact
02:15:57.98 --> 02:16:03.50 the Congressional Research Service and ask them to ask the US government and investigate
02:16:03.50 --> 02:16:09.26 the attack and we got a response from one I've been trying for years and one finally actually asked
02:16:09.26 --> 02:16:17.02 the the Congressional Research Service and he said no another one asks for Congress to allow
02:16:17.02 --> 02:16:23.26 their boilerplate responses to members to constituents who write asking about the attack
02:16:24.94 --> 02:16:32.62 stop using Israeli talking points use USS Liberty survivors talking points and
02:16:32.62 --> 02:16:40.06 the the the season way to for them to get involved and then when they get the responses
02:16:41.10 --> 02:16:44.86 send them to us and we can draft a a response for them to to send.
02:16:46.86 --> 02:16:51.58 That's the old letter writing campaign. Yeah let's get let's get them that way
02:16:52.86 --> 02:16:58.86 anything else shall I think that's it. Fill any closing thoughts. Yes and closing I
02:16:58.86 --> 02:17:04.78 encourage your listeners and watchers at all down low-diss share it with everybody
02:17:04.78 --> 02:17:10.30 pass the word around. Write your senators and congressmen and let her know that the real deal
02:17:10.30 --> 02:17:15.58 is that you've been lying about this all the time and we know it but they don't want to come back
02:17:15.58 --> 02:17:20.38 and tell them tell everybody that their lives anyway I mean it's going to be hard I mean
02:17:20.38 --> 02:17:24.70 the Congress and everything is going to take the people people your listeners to help us out
02:17:24.70 --> 02:17:32.62 people that did watch sacrifice on Liberty go sacrifice on Liberty.com and God bless you for having us on
02:17:32.62 --> 02:17:37.50 your your good man and all of you I appreciate it so much God bless you. One thing I
02:17:37.50 --> 02:17:44.22 forgot to mention since your blog is posted on your YouTube site there's a comment section
02:17:45.34 --> 02:17:51.74 and we'd be happy to enter into a dialogue with anybody on that comment section whether they're
02:17:51.74 --> 02:17:59.98 pro is really think they're pro is really or on the US side. The comments will definitely be there.
02:17:59.98 --> 02:18:05.58 Okay yeah we look forward to it. Well thanks for coming you know that these these
02:18:06.78 --> 02:18:11.58 the conjecture and the mystery around all these events they they they've been around for a while but
02:18:11.58 --> 02:18:16.14 I think there's one thing that there's absolutely no mystery about one thing that cannot be disputed
02:18:16.14 --> 02:18:22.46 and that's the courage and the valor and the sacrifice of the brave sailors of the US S Liberty.
02:18:22.46 --> 02:18:30.78 So thank you for coming on thank you for sharing your story. Thank you all personally for your
02:18:31.34 --> 02:18:37.74 service and your sacrifice and we won't forget what you did for the country and nor will we ever
02:18:37.74 --> 02:18:46.94 forget the memory of your 34 shipmates who gave their lives and who embodied the navy ethos
02:18:48.30 --> 02:18:54.94 of honor, courage and commitment we commit to not forgetting their sacrifice. Thank you.
02:18:54.94 --> 02:18:57.66 Thank you yes thank you. Thanks for coming guys. Thanks you.
02:18:58.70 --> 02:19:05.50 And with that Joe and Larry and Phil have left the building echo did you know anything about the
02:19:05.50 --> 02:19:13.50 USS Liberty prior to today. Oh I have heard things. I'm not at the end of the day no. Let's say
02:19:13.50 --> 02:19:21.10 there's level five knowledge. I was at level 0.5. So you knew it existed but you didn't know too much about it.
02:19:21.10 --> 02:19:28.14 Yeah like when you said that they were coming on and you said the USS Liberty I was like
02:19:28.14 --> 02:19:33.26 like I was like okay it wasn't like just in the dark it wasn't a shot in the dark for me. No.
02:19:33.26 --> 02:19:39.58 Yeah so it's too bad more people don't know about it and I'm glad that they were able to come on
02:19:39.58 --> 02:19:46.46 and share the story and it just you know just really it is kind of crazy and I think we've done
02:19:46.46 --> 02:19:52.22 I've done some you know obviously we've done some podcasts about well about McNamara for sure
02:19:53.42 --> 02:20:00.86 and I'm not a I don't like McNamara I don't like the way he led I don't like the way he did things
02:20:00.86 --> 02:20:07.50 and so this is just like another nail in the coffin for McNamara from my perspective
02:20:08.70 --> 02:20:15.82 to know that you know he was one of the people that allowed this stuff to happen and LBJ the same thing
02:20:16.70 --> 02:20:19.98 President Johnson same thing you know President Johnson
02:20:22.14 --> 02:20:28.30 it just shows you the level of kind of corruption and ineptitude that the leadership had
02:20:28.30 --> 02:20:36.54 and what's I don't really what really bothers me about it is you know if someone's not capable
02:20:36.54 --> 02:20:41.02 and they end up in a position you're like you know if you're if you're supposed to be doing something
02:20:41.02 --> 02:20:47.26 and you don't have the capability of doing it I'm probably not I'm not going to be mad at you you know I'm not
02:20:47.26 --> 02:20:52.46 going to get mad at you but if you're capable what you're doing things a certain way for
02:20:53.10 --> 02:20:56.78 because you think you're smarter than everybody else or you think you can outsmart the
02:20:56.78 --> 02:21:02.22 American people or you think you can outsmart you know your your boss or whatever and you you
02:21:02.22 --> 02:21:06.46 you're trying to maneuver I'm going to have a problem with that so I'm going to have a more of a problem
02:21:06.46 --> 02:21:11.98 with I'm actually going to have a lot more of a problem with someone that's just hey echo had this
02:21:11.98 --> 02:21:17.82 idea this what he thought was going to happen it didn't go that way okay you know got it
02:21:18.94 --> 02:21:24.54 he's not capable of doing it he didn't understand the situation like he can't get mad at someone's
02:21:24.54 --> 02:21:30.22 lack of ability to do something but if echo was smart and you were in there and you made decisions
02:21:30.22 --> 02:21:36.86 that actually made things go a certain way that's going to make me mad and that's how I feel
02:21:36.86 --> 02:21:45.34 about Mac and Marin Johnson and so there you go so what okay so governments claiming mistake
02:21:45.34 --> 02:21:53.58 and identity they're claiming what like what exactly what's the explanation there are several
02:21:53.58 --> 02:22:00.22 explanations the main thing that what the what the government says the fashion say it's all the
02:22:00.22 --> 02:22:03.98 government's not all the government says this that this cover up at the time was hey it was mistaken
02:22:03.98 --> 02:22:10.94 identity it was a you know unfortunate incident the the Israeli said sorry we're carrying on with our
02:22:10.94 --> 02:22:20.30 mission there's two there's two real explanations one of them is that hey the Israelis didn't want
02:22:20.30 --> 02:22:26.54 Americans listening so they attacked the ship and there's one that is the Israelis wanted
02:22:28.86 --> 02:22:36.62 they wanted America to enter the war and they knew that America would enter the war if one of
02:22:36.62 --> 02:22:44.78 the American ships was attacked by these Arab forces and so they tried to do it in such a way
02:22:44.78 --> 02:22:48.62 that because you wouldn't think the Israelis would do that I mean that's like crazy right there's
02:22:48.62 --> 02:22:53.18 are are actual allies so how could this happen it must have been the you know it was obviously
02:22:53.18 --> 02:23:02.86 the Arabs there's no survivors the ship is sunk and gone we better go pay the Arab nations back
02:23:02.86 --> 02:23:10.54 for sinking our ship so is it out of the question that people do that kind of thing not at all not
02:23:10.54 --> 02:23:19.18 at all false flag attacks like that's a literal false flag attack so and look I don't really even know
02:23:19.74 --> 02:23:26.70 how debatable it even is you know like this is the Israelis have admitted that they attack the
02:23:26.70 --> 02:23:34.62 ship they've said it hey it was a mistake we're sorry it wasn't that long it wasn't that bad we didn't
02:23:34.62 --> 02:23:40.30 shoot up there's there's some where they directly conflict with no we didn't shoot up the life bolts
02:23:40.30 --> 02:23:46.38 the life bolts they said didn't do that so they they kind of claim it they kind of downplay it
02:23:46.38 --> 02:23:51.26 and claimed it's a mistake that's sort of the cover up the cover up is downplay it it was a mistake
02:23:51.26 --> 02:23:59.90 the reality is at least at least admit the full extent of what happened and then on top of that
02:23:59.90 --> 02:24:07.18 was it intentional did you actually want to do this to drag Americans into this war and then
02:24:07.18 --> 02:24:14.14 if you want to do that and the people that called off the support to the vessel are Americans
02:24:14.14 --> 02:24:21.74 you knew about it so that's why these guys are calling for a full congressional investigation
02:24:22.54 --> 02:24:28.94 a congressional inquiry to figure out exactly what happened so people can be held accountable
02:24:28.94 --> 02:24:33.10 and not only so people can be held accountable but so you can look back and say hey here's the
02:24:33.10 --> 02:24:39.90 mistakes that we made we put too much power in this position we we allowed our allies to do too much
02:24:39.90 --> 02:24:44.30 we didn't run through the chain of command like there's a bunch of things that you can learn from it
02:24:44.30 --> 02:24:48.86 and to not break it down with the inquiry like that and find out what actually happened I mean
02:24:48.86 --> 02:24:55.58 a seven day inquiry I mean Phil brought in a stack of papers he got all kinds of information about this
02:24:55.58 --> 02:25:03.82 you couldn't even cover that information in seven day inquiry so yeah that's it you kind of
02:25:03.82 --> 02:25:08.30 in a way draw the line in the sand when you start like lying and then telling people would
02:25:08.30 --> 02:25:13.50 be like hey you're not allowed to talk about this whatever that's okay and even that I you know
02:25:13.50 --> 02:25:20.46 as I said on the podcast there are some things for national security where this is what happened
02:25:20.46 --> 02:25:24.78 and you can't talk about it anymore hey all the saw guys warn allowed to talk about the secret
02:25:24.78 --> 02:25:30.54 war for twenty years that's what actually happened they signed a paper and said they couldn't talk about it
02:25:30.54 --> 02:25:35.98 those are classified information you know I'll talk about it what's what makes it disturbing in
02:25:35.98 --> 02:25:41.34 this one is it doesn't seem like the national security in a straightforward manner was in jeopardy
02:25:41.98 --> 02:25:47.66 what was in jeopardy was the relationship with Israel the political standing of because if let's
02:25:47.66 --> 02:25:53.26 face it if the America would have found out that somehow our own government was involved in
02:25:53.26 --> 02:25:58.30 attacking one of our own ships like that's game over for the entire administration yeah so what are
02:25:58.30 --> 02:26:06.78 they gonna do hey don't say anything to anybody to protect their own ass and this is not beyond
02:26:06.78 --> 02:26:16.22 a guy like Johnson and not beyond a guy like McNamara yeah so these politicians that think they're
02:26:16.22 --> 02:26:26.70 smart horrible stuff so if you want to support them you can go to USS Liberty Vets
02:26:27.74 --> 02:26:34.62 Liberty Veterans USS Liberty Veterans dot org or USS Liberty Veterans dot blog that's where you can go to
02:26:34.62 --> 02:26:41.02 support them if you want to get a bunch of more information about it there's a movie that
