00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16
This is Jockelbodcast number 338 with echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:05.84
Jockel Willink, good evening echo.

3
00:00:05.84 --> 00:00:10.80
When I was teaching close quarters combat,

4
00:00:10.80 --> 00:00:15.52
which is, you know, going into rooms, going into buildings,

5
00:00:15.52 --> 00:00:18.40
and clearing rooms, and clearing buildings, clearing hallways,

6
00:00:18.40 --> 00:00:21.92
clearing stairwells, there's all kinds of things

7
00:00:21.92 --> 00:00:25.84
that a seal has to do correctly when they do this,

8
00:00:25.84 --> 00:00:27.44
and there are a lot of rules.

9
00:00:27.44 --> 00:00:30.96
A lot of standard operating procedures that you have to follow,

10
00:00:30.96 --> 00:00:35.12
how you enter the room, where your feet go,

11
00:00:35.12 --> 00:00:38.64
where you aim your weapon, and where you don't aim your weapon.

12
00:00:38.64 --> 00:00:44.40
How far you stay off the wall, what you say to your shooting buddy

13
00:00:44.40 --> 00:00:48.80
when you need to move, what you, how you respond to your shooting buddy,

14
00:00:48.80 --> 00:00:49.84
when he needs to move.

15
00:00:49.84 --> 00:00:56.40
There's a bunch of verbal and non-verbal signals that you give

16
00:00:56.40 --> 00:01:01.12
with your voice, with your weapon, with your posture, with your actions.

17
00:01:01.12 --> 00:01:05.28
You got to know how to give those signals, you got to know how to receive those signals.

18
00:01:05.28 --> 00:01:08.56
And then there's a bunch of calls that you actually make,

19
00:01:08.56 --> 00:01:12.48
and again, some of those calls you make, and you pass that word via

20
00:01:12.48 --> 00:01:16.000
verbal or other types of visual signals,

21
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.08
when to move, where to move, what to address,

22
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:25.52
in a particular room or in a hallway or in a building,

23
00:01:25.52 --> 00:01:28.24
because you got to prioritize an execute,

24
00:01:28.24 --> 00:01:30.16
and you go into room, there's multiple things going on.

25
00:01:30.16 --> 00:01:32.16
You got to figure out which one's the most important one.

26
00:01:32.16 --> 00:01:35.36
You got to support your shooting buddy at all times.

27
00:01:35.36 --> 00:01:36.16
That's covered move.

28
00:01:36.16 --> 00:01:40.000
You got to do all this with simple clear concise communication.

29
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.16
You got to make sure that while you're doing all these things,

30
00:01:42.16 --> 00:01:44.64
you're supporting the overall intent to the mission,

31
00:01:44.64 --> 00:01:46.72
which is decentralized command.

32
00:01:46.72 --> 00:01:48.48
So there's a whole bunch of things going on.

33
00:01:50.16 --> 00:01:51.76
When you're doing close quarters combat,

34
00:01:54.16 --> 00:01:55.20
and when I taught this,

35
00:01:57.36 --> 00:02:00.000
there was, you know, we as instructor,

36
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.12
cadre would get really critical about

37
00:02:06.24 --> 00:02:08.64
the actions that the guys entering, the room,

38
00:02:08.64 --> 00:02:12.32
made, because we wanted them to stay tight on the SOPs,

39
00:02:12.32 --> 00:02:14.96
because imagine you enter a room and you go

40
00:02:14.96 --> 00:02:16.08
where you're not supposed to go,

41
00:02:16.08 --> 00:02:18.56
you can get shot by your partner.

42
00:02:18.56 --> 00:02:21.76
So you got to get guys to do the right thing,

43
00:02:21.76 --> 00:02:23.28
and then they've got to be able to make decisions,

44
00:02:23.28 --> 00:02:25.84
they've got to be able to make decisions quickly.

45
00:02:25.84 --> 00:02:27.44
And so us as cadre,

46
00:02:28.72 --> 00:02:31.12
we would definitely help on these guys

47
00:02:31.12 --> 00:02:35.28
and give them firm critique when they screwed something up,

48
00:02:35.28 --> 00:02:36.88
and you're too far off the wall,

49
00:02:36.88 --> 00:02:38.96
or you should address that open door first,

50
00:02:38.96 --> 00:02:40.88
or you can clear behind that couch over there.

51
00:02:40.88 --> 00:02:42.48
So we're getting on these guys,

52
00:02:43.68 --> 00:02:47.04
and there's a million points to critique and criticize,

53
00:02:47.92 --> 00:02:49.92
and we did that.

54
00:02:51.04 --> 00:02:53.44
And again, the reason we did that was to make sure

55
00:02:53.44 --> 00:02:54.72
that they follow the SOPs,

56
00:02:54.72 --> 00:02:57.36
because when you get into a platoon or you're in a platoon,

57
00:02:57.36 --> 00:02:58.88
and you don't follow the SOPs,

58
00:02:58.88 --> 00:03:01.68
there's some SOPs if you don't follow them in CQC,

59
00:03:03.20 --> 00:03:05.76
you can get yourself killed, you can get your buddy killed,

60
00:03:05.76 --> 00:03:07.68
you can get the everybody killed.

61
00:03:07.68 --> 00:03:10.80
So we're hyper critical.

62
00:03:10.80 --> 00:03:13.52
Now, as I watch that,

63
00:03:13.52 --> 00:03:16.72
as my cadre, as I watch my cadre,

64
00:03:16.72 --> 00:03:19.76
I sort of detached and would let the cadre

65
00:03:19.76 --> 00:03:24.56
sort of run those finer points of the standard operating procedures.

66
00:03:24.56 --> 00:03:25.76
And I got to a point where,

67
00:03:27.60 --> 00:03:32.96
I would talk to guys when they do something wrong,

68
00:03:32.96 --> 00:03:37.76
where I'd say, hey, you did what you did.

69
00:03:39.20 --> 00:03:40.24
Let's figure out why.

70
00:03:41.28 --> 00:03:43.68
So in other words, oh, echo went into the room,

71
00:03:44.40 --> 00:03:48.48
and he addressed this door instead of that couch first,

72
00:03:49.68 --> 00:03:51.12
and I could say, hey, that door was open.

73
00:03:51.12 --> 00:03:53.68
It's a big, I would say, hey, echo,

74
00:03:53.68 --> 00:03:57.20
you addressed the couch and you turned your back on the door.

75
00:03:57.20 --> 00:03:58.48
What were you thinking about?

76
00:03:58.48 --> 00:04:00.96
Because I wanted to know why you did it,

77
00:04:00.96 --> 00:04:04.40
so that I can learn more,

78
00:04:04.40 --> 00:04:06.56
and I can allow me to teach better.

79
00:04:06.56 --> 00:04:08.64
If I know why you did something,

80
00:04:08.64 --> 00:04:09.68
and you say, well, you know,

81
00:04:09.68 --> 00:04:11.92
I thought that the biggest threat was the one that was closest to me.

82
00:04:11.92 --> 00:04:13.76
Well, this one might be further away,

83
00:04:13.76 --> 00:04:16.48
but if it's a bigger space to hide

84
00:04:16.48 --> 00:04:17.92
behind whatever the case may be.

85
00:04:19.44 --> 00:04:24.08
So, as I learned why people made mistakes

86
00:04:24.08 --> 00:04:28.000
that helped me be able to teach these things better,

87
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.48
because then I could close some of those loose ends,

88
00:04:30.48 --> 00:04:32.56
as I'm teaching it.

89
00:04:32.56 --> 00:04:34.32
And I took this to other areas of training,

90
00:04:34.32 --> 00:04:36.08
as well, especially with the leaders, right?

91
00:04:36.08 --> 00:04:37.68
Especially with the leaders, the young,

92
00:04:37.68 --> 00:04:39.52
see the leaders trying to understand,

93
00:04:39.52 --> 00:04:40.64
not just what they did wrong,

94
00:04:40.64 --> 00:04:43.20
and point out to them what they did wrong,

95
00:04:43.20 --> 00:04:47.68
but why they did it, so that I could adjust the training

96
00:04:47.68 --> 00:04:50.24
to address the shortfall, and I could address,

97
00:04:50.24 --> 00:04:54.000
and adjust my own methodology of instruction

98
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.48
to make sure that I explained it in a way

99
00:04:56.48 --> 00:05:01.28
that they understood why we were doing something a certain way.

100
00:05:01.28 --> 00:05:03.52
So, I need to figure out, I needed to figure out

101
00:05:04.64 --> 00:05:07.76
what they were thinking and why they were thinking it,

102
00:05:07.76 --> 00:05:09.36
and I learned a lot from doing that.

103
00:05:10.40 --> 00:05:13.04
And of course, we would do this type of thing after missions,

104
00:05:13.04 --> 00:05:14.80
as well, you know, the debrief.

105
00:05:15.84 --> 00:05:19.12
We get on with a mission, we immediately are going to go do a debrief.

106
00:05:19.12 --> 00:05:23.12
What happened, why it happened, what we could do better,

107
00:05:23.12 --> 00:05:27.36
and of course, if we had a someone on the team

108
00:05:27.36 --> 00:05:30.72
that mess something up, I would talk to them about why they did it,

109
00:05:30.72 --> 00:05:33.68
not just remo-out because they screwed up,

110
00:05:33.68 --> 00:05:35.76
but hey, what were you thinking when you made that move?

111
00:05:35.76 --> 00:05:37.92
What were you thinking, why did you move into that building?

112
00:05:37.92 --> 00:05:39.28
What did you think was going to happen?

113
00:05:42.56 --> 00:05:44.32
And, you know, if you read Extreme Ownership,

114
00:05:44.32 --> 00:05:46.000
the first chapter after the blue on blue,

115
00:05:47.12 --> 00:05:48.96
of course, we obviously debriefed,

116
00:05:48.96 --> 00:05:51.68
and we created some new standard operating procedures

117
00:05:51.68 --> 00:05:55.20
to prevent it from happening again,

118
00:05:55.20 --> 00:05:57.84
or at least mitigate the risk as much as we could.

119
00:05:57.84 --> 00:05:59.84
And if you read the rest of the book,

120
00:05:59.84 --> 00:06:03.84
there were even more situations that we talk about in the book

121
00:06:03.84 --> 00:06:07.52
that were close to being catastrophic,

122
00:06:08.72 --> 00:06:11.12
fracture sites, catastrophic blue on blues.

123
00:06:11.68 --> 00:06:14.80
But we were able to stop those from happening

124
00:06:14.80 --> 00:06:16.96
either from our procedures that we had put in place,

125
00:06:17.92 --> 00:06:20.64
or our better understanding of what could unfold,

126
00:06:20.64 --> 00:06:22.64
or our awareness of what was happening.

127
00:06:24.40 --> 00:06:26.000
And when I got home from that deployment,

128
00:06:27.36 --> 00:06:30.16
I debriefed that operation, that blue on blue,

129
00:06:30.16 --> 00:06:33.84
I debriefed over and over again to the seal teams

130
00:06:34.40 --> 00:06:35.92
and the platoons that were going through training,

131
00:06:35.92 --> 00:06:37.36
and the troops that were going through training,

132
00:06:37.36 --> 00:06:40.16
to try and pass on the lessons learned to everyone,

133
00:06:40.80 --> 00:06:42.56
and then we set up training

134
00:06:44.88 --> 00:06:47.68
that we organized the training

135
00:06:47.68 --> 00:06:51.68
so that those lessons learned would get embedded

136
00:06:51.68 --> 00:06:53.68
into these young seal leaders.

137
00:06:53.68 --> 00:06:55.68
They would understand how these things happened,

138
00:06:55.68 --> 00:06:57.68
so they could prevent them from happening,

139
00:06:57.68 --> 00:07:01.04
and I was told many times over the years,

140
00:07:01.84 --> 00:07:06.08
that the training and awareness that we gave people,

141
00:07:07.20 --> 00:07:10.72
prevented many friendly fire incidences from happening.

142
00:07:10.72 --> 00:07:13.36
And in case in point Jason Gardner's got a few

143
00:07:13.92 --> 00:07:16.24
in that he that happened to him on his deployment

144
00:07:16.24 --> 00:07:19.28
to Afghanistan where he straight up said,

145
00:07:19.28 --> 00:07:21.60
you know, like, if I wouldn't have been aware,

146
00:07:21.60 --> 00:07:24.48
we wouldn't have had that blue on blue training,

147
00:07:24.48 --> 00:07:26.96
that this we probably would have had a blue on blue for real.

148
00:07:27.68 --> 00:07:28.96
So I heard that many times.

149
00:07:32.72 --> 00:07:36.72
Now, a lot of people have been asking me

150
00:07:38.24 --> 00:07:41.44
about the horrific scenario that unfolded

151
00:07:41.44 --> 00:07:44.56
in Evaldae, Texas.

152
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Psychotic and socio-pathic gunmen entered a school

153
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and killed 19 innocent children and two adults.

154
00:07:58.16 --> 00:08:05.76
And I can't even fathom the grief and the fact that

155
00:08:05.76 --> 00:08:12.24
the just trauma for those families, the horror, the whole

156
00:08:12.24 --> 00:08:16.24
in their lives that they have now that can never be replaced.

157
00:08:18.32 --> 00:08:27.60
And the potential of life that was thrown away

158
00:08:28.56 --> 00:08:30.96
before it even had a chance to grow.

159
00:08:30.96 --> 00:08:36.80
And it's just a completely heart-breaking situation.

160
00:08:38.24 --> 00:08:43.44
And what has made the situation even harder to process

161
00:08:45.52 --> 00:08:50.24
was the response from law enforcement on the scene.

162
00:08:51.76 --> 00:08:58.80
And of course, we all like to think about and talk about what I would have done.

163
00:08:58.80 --> 00:09:01.52
But I would have done if I were there.

164
00:09:01.52 --> 00:09:04.80
And I get that, everyone is horrified by what took place.

165
00:09:06.64 --> 00:09:11.12
And we all like to think that we would have been brave

166
00:09:11.12 --> 00:09:12.56
or that we would have been more decisive

167
00:09:12.56 --> 00:09:14.96
that we would have had more situational awareness

168
00:09:14.96 --> 00:09:17.60
that we would have handled the scenario in a way

169
00:09:17.60 --> 00:09:19.20
that created a better outcome.

170
00:09:19.20 --> 00:09:26.08
Of course, we all like to, we would all give anything

171
00:09:26.08 --> 00:09:30.16
to be able to create a better outcome in that situation.

172
00:09:32.88 --> 00:09:37.68
And unfortunately, the situation has already happened.

173
00:09:37.68 --> 00:09:39.28
The outcome is complete.

174
00:09:41.92 --> 00:09:44.48
And we can't change what happened.

175
00:09:45.36 --> 00:09:48.80
And what the response was, any more than I could change the decision

176
00:09:48.80 --> 00:09:52.16
a young seal made when he walked into Roman, moved the wrong way,

177
00:09:52.16 --> 00:09:58.08
or addressed the wrong threat, I couldn't change what he had done.

178
00:09:59.68 --> 00:10:03.20
I could tell him what he did wrong, but what I really needed to do

179
00:10:03.20 --> 00:10:08.08
as I said was to understand why he made that decision

180
00:10:09.92 --> 00:10:10.72
and learn from it.

181
00:10:11.84 --> 00:10:14.48
And then figure out how I could teach other people

182
00:10:14.48 --> 00:10:15.52
to not make that mistake.

183
00:10:15.52 --> 00:10:22.000
And that is unfortunately the best I can offer in this

184
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.68
situation as well.

185
00:10:24.72 --> 00:10:29.28
Now, there are other things to talk about

186
00:10:30.80 --> 00:10:34.96
with regards to contributing factors in this situation.

187
00:10:35.36 --> 00:10:38.56
And you've got mental health, you've got media violence,

188
00:10:38.56 --> 00:10:42.24
you've got dehumanization of people, you've got gun laws,

189
00:10:42.24 --> 00:10:44.48
and they're enforcement or lack of enforcement.

190
00:10:45.36 --> 00:10:50.56
And I talked about some of those on the Jocco and Ravling podcast

191
00:10:50.56 --> 00:10:55.28
with Darrell Cooper and all those, the thing is with all those,

192
00:10:55.28 --> 00:10:57.04
those are massive subjects.

193
00:10:58.56 --> 00:11:01.68
Those are massive subjects, all of them that are being discussed

194
00:11:01.68 --> 00:11:06.80
at the national level and will take some unified efforts

195
00:11:08.64 --> 00:11:09.20
to solve.

196
00:11:09.84 --> 00:11:12.40
They'll take some unified efforts and by that I mean people actually

197
00:11:12.40 --> 00:11:15.52
working together, which we don't seem to have any of.

198
00:11:15.52 --> 00:11:20.40
So as that conversation continues to take place,

199
00:11:21.44 --> 00:11:25.20
I just want to look at what happened

200
00:11:25.20 --> 00:11:30.08
tactically on the ground and try and figure out why it happened.

201
00:11:32.48 --> 00:11:35.92
And I'm going to use a timeline, follow a timeline from the Texas Tribune.

202
00:11:36.88 --> 00:11:43.92
It was last updated on June 9th and just just to note,

203
00:11:43.92 --> 00:11:48.08
we're recording this today on June 13th, 2022.

204
00:11:49.12 --> 00:11:53.76
And it's just based on simple open source reporting.

205
00:11:53.76 --> 00:11:58.24
And I'm sure that there will be more detailed information available in the future

206
00:11:58.24 --> 00:12:01.28
and maybe at some point we'll go over it with more detail.

207
00:12:01.68 --> 00:12:04.32
But the thing is there are lessons to be learned

208
00:12:05.28 --> 00:12:07.36
even from what we know right now

209
00:12:08.32 --> 00:12:12.08
that that I want to talk a little bit about again from the tactical perspective

210
00:12:12.08 --> 00:12:17.52
to try and figure out why things happened like this in this event.

211
00:12:18.88 --> 00:12:25.76
So again from the Texas Tribune, this is May 24th, 2022 around 11am.

212
00:12:25.76 --> 00:12:28.40
The shooter sends Facebook messages.

213
00:12:28.72 --> 00:12:31.76
The shooter sends private Facebook messages to a girl in Germany.

214
00:12:31.76 --> 00:12:35.04
He met online and tells her about his plans to shoot his grandmother.

215
00:12:35.04 --> 00:12:40.96
The gunman shoots his grandmother in the face and calls the police.

216
00:12:43.60 --> 00:12:46.64
The shooter steals his grandmother's vehicle and drives from his home

217
00:12:48.08 --> 00:12:51.68
to Rob Elementary School, which is about two miles away.

218
00:12:54.88 --> 00:13:01.92
So there you have a clear declaration that something bad is going to happen made by the

219
00:13:01.92 --> 00:13:10.88
individual himself and I don't know if there's some kind of a social media 911 call that you can make.

220
00:13:10.88 --> 00:13:19.52
It seems like there should be some kind of a social media 911 to call

221
00:13:20.72 --> 00:13:28.16
where if someone is making threats of violence via social media that people that see these threats

222
00:13:28.16 --> 00:13:34.80
can have someone to contact where action can be taken.

223
00:13:36.80 --> 00:13:42.08
And I don't know if there is an AI that can screen for things like this.

224
00:13:42.80 --> 00:13:50.96
My guess is yes considering that if I Google search something on my phone or on my laptop

225
00:13:52.16 --> 00:13:56.64
the very next screen that I click I get advertisements for whatever that thing that I just searched is.

226
00:13:56.64 --> 00:14:03.20
So to think that we couldn't come up with or that the tech companies couldn't come up with something

227
00:14:03.20 --> 00:14:10.64
that was coming through messages coming through posts looking for threatening content.

228
00:14:11.68 --> 00:14:13.76
It seems like that would be a feasible thing.

229
00:14:15.28 --> 00:14:24.08
And at a minimum to have something where there's like a universal 911 call to make if someone is posting

230
00:14:24.08 --> 00:14:28.64
threatening things it seems like that would be a move that would be over the help

231
00:14:29.36 --> 00:14:31.60
these when these situations unfold.

232
00:14:35.36 --> 00:14:39.52
Moving to 1128 AM the shooter arrives at the school.

233
00:14:40.32 --> 00:14:42.88
The shooter crashes the vehicle into a ditch near the school.

234
00:14:42.88 --> 00:14:48.000
He fires his gun at two male witnesses who began approaching the crash from a nearby funeral home.

235
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
The witness is fleeing call 911.

236
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.20
So this is at 1128.

237
00:14:58.24 --> 00:15:05.68
When you get a shooter that's in the vicinity of a school there's got to be a really good lockdown

238
00:15:05.68 --> 00:15:06.96
protocol that happens.

239
00:15:09.84 --> 00:15:15.84
And this is something when we talk about lockdown protocol

240
00:15:15.84 --> 00:15:23.76
one thing that that I think needs to be discussed is if you have a shooter that's

241
00:15:23.76 --> 00:15:26.56
external to the school lock the doors.

242
00:15:28.16 --> 00:15:30.16
But when you have a shooter that's in the school

243
00:15:32.40 --> 00:15:34.24
everyone should get the hell out of the school.

244
00:15:34.24 --> 00:15:36.24
You shouldn't keep people in the school anymore.

245
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.96
So having a couple different immediate action drills

246
00:15:42.96 --> 00:15:49.92
when it comes to when when when when a shooter is either in a school we're going to get out of the school.

247
00:15:49.92 --> 00:15:52.32
If it's outside the school we're going to stay in the school we're going to lock it down.

248
00:15:53.04 --> 00:15:56.24
Those require two different reactions not one.

249
00:15:58.64 --> 00:16:01.52
Because if there's a shooter in the school you should get the hell out of the school.

250
00:16:06.48 --> 00:16:10.08
1130 AM a teacher calls 911.

251
00:16:10.08 --> 00:16:17.12
Teacher at the elementary school makes a 911 call reporting the crash and seeing the shooter noting he has a gun.

252
00:16:18.72 --> 00:16:24.40
The shooter walks toward the school climbs the fence into the parking lot and shoots at the school several times.

253
00:16:26.24 --> 00:16:32.72
Again, if the shooters outside the school we should have an instant protocol to keep them outside the school.

254
00:16:32.72 --> 00:16:39.52
1131 AM shooter walks into school parking lot.

255
00:16:39.52 --> 00:16:43.84
The shooter reaches the last row of vehicles in the school parking lot firing his rifle throughout.

256
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.44
Police arrive at the funeral home.

257
00:16:47.44 --> 00:16:53.28
So you remember the people that initially reacted to the crash they ran back to a funeral home called the police.

258
00:16:53.28 --> 00:16:55.28
The police now arrive at the funeral home.

259
00:16:55.68 --> 00:17:00.24
A school district police officer speeds in the direction of a person they think is the man with the gun

260
00:17:00.24 --> 00:17:04.24
reported by the teacher but drives past the gunmen and heads to the back of the school

261
00:17:04.24 --> 00:17:05.76
mistaking a teacher for the shooter.

262
00:17:10.80 --> 00:17:14.24
So you have a problem of positive identification now.

263
00:17:15.52 --> 00:17:21.12
Where you got teachers who are the only adults in the schools except for the shooter.

264
00:17:21.12 --> 00:17:22.32
So how are you going to tell them apart?

265
00:17:24.08 --> 00:17:28.32
This is where we look and say hey is there an armband that we have?

266
00:17:28.32 --> 00:17:34.32
Is there an emergency everyone knows to put on a certain t-shirt or a certain vest?

267
00:17:34.32 --> 00:17:36.96
And you know you might be thinking all that sounds stupid.

268
00:17:36.96 --> 00:17:42.64
If you've ever been into a combat situation where there's multiple people running around on the battlefield,

269
00:17:42.64 --> 00:17:44.48
positive identification is a real problem.

270
00:17:45.68 --> 00:17:47.68
It is really hard to identify who's who.

271
00:17:50.08 --> 00:17:55.44
And you can make it a lot easier if you throw if you give people some kind of a uniform to put on where,

272
00:17:55.44 --> 00:17:58.40
oh all the teachers are wearing a vest that says teacher on it.

273
00:17:59.52 --> 00:18:00.40
On orange vest.

274
00:18:11.60 --> 00:18:14.16
11.33 am the shooter enters the school.

275
00:18:16.72 --> 00:18:18.96
Shooter enters the school for the back through the back door.

276
00:18:18.96 --> 00:18:25.76
He shoots at least 100 rounds inside classes, classrooms 11 11 and 112 which are connected.

277
00:18:28.16 --> 00:18:33.84
Authorities originally said a teacher left the door prompt open, but later said a teacher

278
00:18:33.84 --> 00:18:36.64
closed the door and the automatic lock failed.

279
00:18:38.64 --> 00:18:41.92
And there's she's the a quote here.

280
00:18:41.92 --> 00:18:45.68
She remembers pulling the door closed while telling 911 that he was shooting.

281
00:18:45.68 --> 00:18:49.76
She thought the door would lock because the door is always supposed to lock.

282
00:18:53.52 --> 00:18:55.20
I've heard some people talk about

283
00:18:58.72 --> 00:19:04.96
the horrible idea of or what seems like a horrible idea of turning schools into

284
00:19:07.52 --> 00:19:09.60
you know bunkers type of thing.

285
00:19:09.60 --> 00:19:11.20
Oh we can have our guards every.

286
00:19:11.20 --> 00:19:18.88
And look no one wants to bring their kids to a school where the school feels like it's a reverse

287
00:19:18.88 --> 00:19:22.64
prison right or some kind of a prison environment where you've got barbed wire and you've got bars

288
00:19:22.64 --> 00:19:24.000
on the window and all this kind of stuff.

289
00:19:24.56 --> 00:19:26.88
No one wants to bring their their kids to school like that.

290
00:19:26.88 --> 00:19:36.24
But there is a way to properly secure schools where it doesn't look like some prison camp.

291
00:19:36.24 --> 00:19:41.28
There's absolutely a way to make that happen.

292
00:19:42.96 --> 00:19:48.08
And I think that just about any parent I think actually any parent would be okay

293
00:19:48.56 --> 00:19:57.52
with having some security in place so that the school is a place where people can't get into

294
00:19:57.52 --> 00:19:58.80
unless they're supposed to be there.

295
00:19:58.80 --> 00:20:07.52
So the back doors open look does this mean I'm a little bit paranoid?

296
00:20:09.60 --> 00:20:10.16
Mate yes.

297
00:20:12.08 --> 00:20:17.20
Yeah little bit paranoid and I think a little bit of paranoia is actually okay.

298
00:20:19.52 --> 00:20:21.44
A little bit of paranoia is actually okay.

299
00:20:21.44 --> 00:20:28.56
So that was at 1133.

300
00:20:30.96 --> 00:20:39.20
At 1135 the the Uvalde police enter the school.

301
00:20:41.44 --> 00:20:44.96
Three police officers rushed to the same door that the gunman used to enter which was closed.

302
00:20:44.96 --> 00:20:49.68
They enter receive grazing wounds from the gunman they retreat.

303
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.08
So response time has been, well 1128 AM the shooter arrives at the school.

304
00:21:01.84 --> 00:21:06.08
1131 he's walking through the parking lot 1133 he enters the school.

305
00:21:06.08 --> 00:21:08.64
The police arrive pretty quickly.

306
00:21:08.64 --> 00:21:15.76
Now if there was some kind of security guard there I guess what response time is zero minutes.

307
00:21:17.60 --> 00:21:23.04
And does this mean that your kid feels like he's going to school in a in a damn prison?

308
00:21:23.84 --> 00:21:27.84
Because there's a plain closed security guard there.

309
00:21:30.24 --> 00:21:31.36
I'm okay with that.

310
00:21:32.88 --> 00:21:33.92
Do I love it?

311
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:37.20
No I don't.

312
00:21:39.76 --> 00:21:44.64
But this is not that big of a price to pay to keep kids safe.

313
00:21:46.72 --> 00:21:53.04
The idea that a guard or an armed guard has to be some over presence

314
00:21:54.16 --> 00:21:56.80
that the kids have to walk by to get to class.

315
00:21:56.80 --> 00:22:03.20
Oh there's you know Mr. Fred with the with the AR 15 guarding us.

316
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.96
I feel intimidated because I'm a little kid I don't like I don't like it.

317
00:22:06.96 --> 00:22:07.84
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

318
00:22:08.56 --> 00:22:10.96
Does it have to be like no it doesn't actually have to be that way at all.

319
00:22:13.84 --> 00:22:17.20
There can be a very low visibility option for that.

320
00:22:19.60 --> 00:22:22.88
And it can be a low visibility option that the children don't know much about but the

321
00:22:22.88 --> 00:22:30.72
public does know about and therefore it also you it also causes deterrence for a would be school shooter.

322
00:22:32.40 --> 00:22:39.12
If the would be school shooter knows that there are armed people in the school they're probably going to

323
00:22:39.12 --> 00:22:40.24
figure out a different target.

324
00:22:45.68 --> 00:22:49.28
So the police officers enter the school they get shot at.

325
00:22:49.28 --> 00:22:55.04
That receive grazing wounds they retreat.

326
00:22:59.28 --> 00:23:08.48
So this is a tough one to with what I know about you know they only were into

327
00:23:08.48 --> 00:23:11.20
their retreat and that they that they received fire.

328
00:23:12.32 --> 00:23:14.16
This could mean a bunch of different things.

329
00:23:14.16 --> 00:23:21.04
This could mean full automatic fire that is at the shooting at the door that they're trying to get through.

330
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.96
And if that's the case and they proceed and they're just all going to die.

331
00:23:27.52 --> 00:23:28.40
And now they can't help.

332
00:23:31.28 --> 00:23:38.64
Or is it some rounds came and they immediately retreated? I don't know. I don't know what happened there.

333
00:23:38.64 --> 00:23:42.24
I do know this.

334
00:23:44.16 --> 00:23:48.72
When you're getting shot at you now have information.

335
00:23:50.24 --> 00:23:52.56
You have very pertinent information.

336
00:23:54.48 --> 00:23:56.24
You know the general location.

337
00:23:57.36 --> 00:24:00.96
If you're taking rounds you you know where they're you know at least a little bit where they're coming from.

338
00:24:03.52 --> 00:24:05.52
So now we can start to formulate some kind of a plan.

339
00:24:05.52 --> 00:24:09.20
You also know that you've got a high threat scenario and you've got children in there.

340
00:24:10.24 --> 00:24:14.88
Now you can't just put down cover fire and shoot back at a person in the school because there's a bunch of kids.

341
00:24:14.88 --> 00:24:16.72
And you can get a friendly fire scenario happening.

342
00:24:18.96 --> 00:24:24.32
So you can't just lay down cover fire like you would over in a you know foreign country in a war.

343
00:24:27.92 --> 00:24:31.20
But you know where the bad guy is generally speaking.

344
00:24:31.20 --> 00:24:36.56
You know at least the door that you're at he has covered which tells you what.

345
00:24:37.20 --> 00:24:40.24
There's other doors that he may not have covered.

346
00:24:41.28 --> 00:24:43.44
Meaning other doors where he may not be able to engage.

347
00:24:45.68 --> 00:24:50.000
So we've tried one entry and we have now an information that we can't get in there.

348
00:24:50.000 --> 00:25:02.40
So now what are we going to do find another place to go?

349
00:25:02.40 --> 00:25:03.68
Going back to the timeline here.

350
00:25:05.04 --> 00:25:11.28
Pete Eradondo the chief of the school districts police department also arrives at the scene around this time.

351
00:25:12.24 --> 00:25:13.68
He does not have his radios.

352
00:25:13.68 --> 00:25:22.48
Eradondo wanted both hands on his gun if he encountered the shooter and believed the radios would have slowed him down.

353
00:25:22.48 --> 00:25:23.52
His attorney said.

354
00:25:27.84 --> 00:25:31.84
Now that's.

355
00:25:34.08 --> 00:25:36.72
This is not this is not even a thing.

356
00:25:36.72 --> 00:25:44.56
It's not even a this is not even a remotely.

357
00:25:45.12 --> 00:25:46.80
Square to a concept in anyway.

358
00:25:47.60 --> 00:25:49.44
What the radio going in.

359
00:25:49.44 --> 00:25:50.48
Get going.

360
00:25:50.48 --> 00:25:51.92
A the radio told you down.

361
00:25:53.52 --> 00:25:55.92
B both hands on your gun.

362
00:25:55.92 --> 00:25:59.60
I mean you don't carry your radio in your hand while you're shooting.

363
00:25:59.60 --> 00:26:02.24
You have you have your radio.

364
00:26:02.24 --> 00:26:06.88
You have a mic to to talk into if you need to.

365
00:26:11.68 --> 00:26:14.80
You going into a situation like this.

366
00:26:15.84 --> 00:26:19.20
Communication during an event like this is beyond critical.

367
00:26:20.24 --> 00:26:24.24
There's beyond critical, especially if you're the chief.

368
00:26:25.28 --> 00:26:28.16
If you're overall in charge of what's happening.

369
00:26:28.16 --> 00:26:33.92
You are the one person that absolutely needs a radio and you're at so does everybody else.

370
00:26:36.48 --> 00:26:40.32
Now you don't always sometimes you don't always have every single person with a radio.

371
00:26:40.32 --> 00:26:45.60
But if you're overall in charge, you're the one that's going to be communicating, receiving

372
00:26:45.60 --> 00:26:47.68
communications, giving directions.

373
00:26:48.40 --> 00:26:52.000
You're the one that's supposed to get an overall concept of what's happening.

374
00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.40
Now this is an insane lack of judgment.

375
00:27:01.60 --> 00:27:06.72
And I would love to pull the thread on this and figure out what actually happened.

376
00:27:08.32 --> 00:27:14.64
My guess is some the chief didn't look in his car, see his radio and go, you know what?

377
00:27:14.64 --> 00:27:16.24
I'm going to leave my radio here.

378
00:27:18.80 --> 00:27:20.24
My guess is that's not what happened.

379
00:27:20.24 --> 00:27:21.60
That might be what the lawyer's saying.

380
00:27:22.24 --> 00:27:26.000
As a rationalization well, he thought he might need it.

381
00:27:26.56 --> 00:27:32.08
He thought it might slow him down and thought that he want to have both hands on his guns.

382
00:27:32.88 --> 00:27:33.52
On his gun.

383
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.12
That might be a post-operation rationalization.

384
00:27:38.16 --> 00:27:44.80
Excuse my guess is that in the panic of the situation,

385
00:27:44.80 --> 00:27:50.88
he didn't think about it for God.

386
00:27:50.88 --> 00:27:54.64
By the way, this points to an equally insane lack of training.

387
00:27:56.16 --> 00:28:01.76
Because no one ever in any kind of scenario ever where more than one person is acting

388
00:28:02.64 --> 00:28:05.68
in different parts of a team decides not to bring a radio.

389
00:28:05.68 --> 00:28:07.84
That's not a decision that anyone is going to make.

390
00:28:07.84 --> 00:28:15.44
I would grab my radio before, if I was in charge, I'd grab my radio before I grab my weapon.

391
00:28:15.44 --> 00:28:16.08
How you like that?

392
00:28:22.24 --> 00:28:26.88
So to be in charge and to decide not to bring your radio is

393
00:28:28.40 --> 00:28:29.36
complete not a failure.

394
00:28:29.36 --> 00:28:31.44
And you're obviously in some things where they ran some scenarios.

395
00:28:31.44 --> 00:28:40.88
Like this, the training, if you train one time doing this and you're in charge,

396
00:28:40.88 --> 00:28:43.44
you'll say damn, I better make sure I have good communications with my team.

397
00:28:44.24 --> 00:28:50.64
If you do this one time, if you approach a hostile target where there's bad guys in there,

398
00:28:51.44 --> 00:28:56.72
one time, no hostages, no children, just one bad guy you put him in a building and you have

399
00:28:56.72 --> 00:29:05.20
you and one other person, you'll make that radio an absolute priority.

400
00:29:10.56 --> 00:29:14.96
One time, now you take a situation where you've got an active shooter and there's a bunch of kids

401
00:29:14.96 --> 00:29:19.36
and you've got different units coming in from different places, you're gone off freaking

402
00:29:19.36 --> 00:29:27.20
need a radio and you would know that if you had any training whatsoever.

403
00:29:30.72 --> 00:29:34.96
Here's the thing, it takes practice and I know this sounds crazy because everyone's

404
00:29:34.96 --> 00:29:39.12
look, everyone's on on chair quarterback and everyone can sit there and look, of course, I would

405
00:29:39.12 --> 00:29:44.16
brought my radio, I'm telling you, I'm telling you this, it takes practice to know this.

406
00:29:44.16 --> 00:29:50.32
As obvious as it seems to everyone right now, it takes practice, you hear kids screaming,

407
00:29:50.32 --> 00:29:55.36
you hear gunshots going off, you're the person in charge, you're kind of panic and you go.

408
00:29:56.80 --> 00:30:01.44
You haven't been trained to the proper level and you go in there with a radio.

409
00:30:04.80 --> 00:30:07.28
So it's again reflects bad training.

410
00:30:07.28 --> 00:30:16.72
And at this point, former officers, including a deputy with the county sheriff's office, also

411
00:30:16.72 --> 00:30:21.28
enter the school at this time. So now we have seven police there against one and again,

412
00:30:21.28 --> 00:30:26.80
I'm going to need to see the breakdown detail of the building itself of where people entered,

413
00:30:26.80 --> 00:30:32.88
but you've got more people in the school now. And by the way, by my numbers, that seven police

414
00:30:32.88 --> 00:30:49.92
against one shooter and I like those odds. Seven against one I like. 1137 gunman fires 16 more rounds.

415
00:30:49.92 --> 00:31:04.96
Again, you have a school with little kids in it and the gunman is shooting. What that means is you go.

416
00:31:04.96 --> 00:31:10.72
That's what that means. Let me refer to that. If you didn't already get the signal

417
00:31:10.72 --> 00:31:17.76
that there's a freaking gunman in a school and you haven't done everything you can to get in there

418
00:31:17.76 --> 00:31:25.52
and now that gunman is shooting again, that's another blaring signal to get your ass in there.

419
00:31:30.16 --> 00:31:35.12
And by the way, these are not, these are lessons that have been learned. When you look

420
00:31:35.12 --> 00:31:39.84
what happened at Column by and they came up with the same kind of conclusions, there was too much

421
00:31:39.84 --> 00:31:49.44
hesitation, there's too much waiting. When you hear this stuff happening, you have to take action.

422
00:31:49.44 --> 00:31:55.04
This is exactly the type of scenario where when I start with teaching the young seals,

423
00:31:55.04 --> 00:32:00.40
I had to teach them to be default aggressive. This is the exact kind of scenario. The problem's not

424
00:32:00.40 --> 00:32:05.92
going to solve itself. You have to go and solve it. That's what you have to do. And the reason that I

425
00:32:05.92 --> 00:32:11.12
had to teach them to be aggressive and have that be their default motives because when things like

426
00:32:11.12 --> 00:32:17.76
this happen, people's natural mode isn't to take action. For many people, their natural mode is,

427
00:32:17.76 --> 00:32:22.40
oh, I don't know what's happening. I'm going to wait to try and figure out what's happening. That's what

428
00:32:22.40 --> 00:32:28.48
they're instinct is. And we have to train that instinct out of many people, not all people.

429
00:32:29.44 --> 00:32:32.56
Some people, you actually have to train in the other direction. Some people have to say, hey,

430
00:32:32.56 --> 00:32:37.76
hold on a second, you have no idea what's happening. Don't go running in there. Most people,

431
00:32:37.76 --> 00:32:42.96
you have to train, hey, if it's going on and you can't tell what's happening, you need to get

432
00:32:42.96 --> 00:32:46.08
aggressive and figure out what's happening. You need to take action.

433
00:32:50.48 --> 00:32:54.40
And in a situation like this, we're now you have a gunman in the school. It's still shooting.

434
00:32:54.40 --> 00:33:08.16
It is time without question to do whatever you need to do to get in there. Now at 143 AM,

435
00:33:08.80 --> 00:33:17.12
Rob Elementary and Yvalday Police Post on Facebook, they announced that the school is under

436
00:33:17.12 --> 00:33:24.72
lockdown status to do gunshots in the area. By the way, this is like 150 rounds have been fired. The

437
00:33:24.72 --> 00:33:28.96
students and staff are safe in the building. The building is secure in a lockdown status. School

438
00:33:28.96 --> 00:33:36.16
officials say in an announcement. So there's no emergency communication in the building.

439
00:33:38.72 --> 00:33:40.64
And what I mean by that, there's no, there's no

440
00:33:40.64 --> 00:33:49.12
proword. So in the military, you have something called a proword, which is one word that means

441
00:33:49.12 --> 00:34:00.000
something that means a whole scenario is taking place. So if I'm out on an operation and we start

442
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.60
taking fire heavy fire from the target building and we have an entered the target yet,

443
00:34:05.60 --> 00:34:12.40
I have one word that I can say. And when I say that one word, everybody knows what to do.

444
00:34:13.12 --> 00:34:17.44
Everyone knows that there's no friendlies in the building that the target building is shooting

445
00:34:17.44 --> 00:34:20.64
heavy fire at us. I can say one word and everybody knows what to do.

446
00:34:21.92 --> 00:34:26.32
If we have people in the target building, we start taking fire. I have one word I can say and everybody

447
00:34:26.32 --> 00:34:33.28
knows what to do. So there's a breakdown of communication here because no one has put out,

448
00:34:33.28 --> 00:34:37.92
hey, there's a freaking shooter in our school that's gunning people down.

449
00:34:40.32 --> 00:34:49.92
No one knows this. So no one knows what's happening. So as you think through these scenarios,

450
00:34:49.92 --> 00:34:53.20
you need to come up with some pro words so that everyone understands what's happening.

451
00:34:55.92 --> 00:35:00.80
At the same time, the Valdi Police Department posts on Facebook, large police presence at

452
00:35:00.80 --> 00:35:07.84
Rob Elementary, we ask the public to avoid the area. So there's not communication between the

453
00:35:07.84 --> 00:35:11.52
school and the police. Do are there police radios in the school?

454
00:35:14.64 --> 00:35:23.76
That seems like a really obvious question, but does the school have the ability to

455
00:35:23.76 --> 00:35:31.68
communicate with the police directly through radios? Because this is not a very hard thing to figure out.

456
00:35:32.40 --> 00:35:34.16
It's not a very costly thing to figure out.

457
00:35:40.80 --> 00:35:52.08
1144 AM, the police officers are inside. Police with with the city of Uvaldi are and the school district

458
00:35:52.08 --> 00:35:58.80
are inside the school. This is 1144. Uvaldi police officers enter the building where the shooter is

459
00:35:58.80 --> 00:36:06.32
from the north entrance. They hear gunfire, our shot at, move back and get cover.

460
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.36
Again, if you're getting shot at, you now have a general idea of where the shooter is.

461
00:36:15.36 --> 00:36:22.80
If you have a general idea where the shooter is, then it's time to maneuver. It's time to flank.

462
00:36:25.84 --> 00:36:29.36
A shooter can only cover so many different directions at the same time.

463
00:36:30.96 --> 00:36:37.84
And how do I know that? Because I've been on both sides of those scenarios.

464
00:36:37.84 --> 00:36:47.44
When you train properly, you not only act as the good guys, you spend time as a bad guy.

465
00:36:49.52 --> 00:36:52.48
So you start to realize what works and what doesn't work.

466
00:36:55.36 --> 00:36:56.80
That's the benefit of training.

467
00:36:56.80 --> 00:37:09.52
Back to the document. Around this time, Eradondo and another Uvaldi police officer enter the building

468
00:37:09.52 --> 00:37:15.28
through the south entrance. Eradondo witnesses the gunfire. He then checks the door to the

469
00:37:15.28 --> 00:37:20.56
classroom that the shooter is in finding it locked. He uses his cell phone to call for squad teams,

470
00:37:20.56 --> 00:37:28.16
snipers, extrication tools, and keys to the classrooms.

471
00:37:30.56 --> 00:37:41.92
This is at 11.44. So all this is taking place for almost over 20 minutes. This has been going on.

472
00:37:41.92 --> 00:37:46.000
And only now we're getting a call for squad team snipers, breaching tools.

473
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:55.60
And it's on the cell phone. How why are we making calls on a cell phone?

474
00:37:57.12 --> 00:37:57.84
Why is that happening?

475
00:38:01.92 --> 00:38:05.12
We have radios. There's a reason you have radios direct communication.

476
00:38:06.56 --> 00:38:10.40
In Centanius immediate direct communication to a whole net of people.

477
00:38:10.40 --> 00:38:14.32
Oh, that's right. Well, he doesn't have his radios.

478
00:38:16.88 --> 00:38:18.000
So he's making cell phone calls.

479
00:38:27.68 --> 00:38:30.08
It says a niche. There's a quote in here.

480
00:38:30.08 --> 00:38:34.48
Initial officers are there and receive gunfire. Therefore, do not make entry.

481
00:38:34.48 --> 00:38:41.12
Officers call everyone in the area for additional resources. Tactical teams, equipment, specialty

482
00:38:41.12 --> 00:38:47.92
equipment, body armor, precision riflemen, and negotiators. They're evacuating students and teachers

483
00:38:47.92 --> 00:38:54.40
during this time. And this is from Victor Escalon, a DPS official during a press conference on May 26.

484
00:38:54.40 --> 00:39:05.44
From the very beginning of this whole thing, you clearly have an active shooter that needs to

485
00:39:05.44 --> 00:39:13.76
be hunted down and killed. That's completely evident from the first moments.

486
00:39:14.88 --> 00:39:18.56
As soon as a car crashes and two guys go to help and they and he gets shot at,

487
00:39:19.68 --> 00:39:23.92
or those two guys get shot at by someone who then maneuvers towards a school,

488
00:39:23.92 --> 00:39:27.68
this is an active shooter situation and someone needs to hunt this guy down and kill him.

489
00:39:30.08 --> 00:39:32.88
And that's the mode that needs to be gone into instantaneously.

490
00:39:35.68 --> 00:39:38.16
And there's going to be risk.

491
00:39:42.80 --> 00:39:45.36
There's going to be risk when you're going up against someone with a gun.

492
00:39:45.36 --> 00:39:51.28
There's a risk that you're going to die. And that's what we in the military and law enforcement

493
00:39:51.28 --> 00:39:57.68
sign up for. And we have to think through that actually and you have to train for that.

494
00:39:58.88 --> 00:40:02.88
And the first time that you think about getting shot and the probability that you get shot

495
00:40:03.52 --> 00:40:06.80
shouldn't be in an actual gunfight. This shouldn't be the first time this is going through your head.

496
00:40:10.48 --> 00:40:15.76
You should do training and you need to do training, where you understand what you're going to

497
00:40:15.76 --> 00:40:21.36
be put up against and you should understand what that feels like and you should either get over it

498
00:40:21.36 --> 00:40:24.16
and accept that as part of your job or you should get a different job.

499
00:40:37.44 --> 00:40:43.68
1148. There's an officers' wife is shot.

500
00:40:43.68 --> 00:40:52.96
So you've got the CISD police officer, Ruben Ruiz, can be heard telling other officers as he arrives

501
00:40:52.96 --> 00:40:57.28
inside the school that his wife, even Morrellis, has been shot.

502
00:40:57.28 --> 00:41:10.72
So you look at this woman, the school teacher just seemed like an amazing human.

503
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.52
She's got pictures, there's pictures of her. She's outdoors, she's enjoying life, she's out

504
00:41:19.52 --> 00:41:26.48
running, she's hiking, she's doing Spartan races, she's doing CrossFit, she's just seems like an awesome woman

505
00:41:28.32 --> 00:41:34.80
and had a daughter with Ruben Ruiz. So he gets word that she shot.

506
00:41:41.20 --> 00:41:48.64
1151 AM, Mor police arrive, more law enforcement officials arrive at the scene again.

507
00:41:48.64 --> 00:41:55.60
So what are we doing at this point? Who is running things at this point in time?

508
00:41:56.80 --> 00:42:05.20
Now you got 1520 law enforcement officers, on scene and you got one bad guy.

509
00:42:07.76 --> 00:42:14.72
That's a fight we can win all day long. All day long. We're going to win and we might take some casualties

510
00:42:14.72 --> 00:42:28.40
but we can win that fight all day long. 1154 AM, there's an onlooker starts filming.

511
00:42:32.96 --> 00:42:38.48
21 minutes after the shooter enters the school and onlooker streams a live video showing

512
00:42:38.48 --> 00:42:49.92
parents begging police to enter the school. Now this is very difficult to watch. This is actually

513
00:42:49.92 --> 00:42:56.64
sickening to watch. There are parents that are going crazy with frustration. They want to help their kids.

514
00:42:59.52 --> 00:43:05.28
And in some of these videos, you can see that the parents are being held back by officers

515
00:43:05.28 --> 00:43:17.36
with long guns, with rifles, with assault rifles. And what they're doing is keeping the parents at bay.

516
00:43:23.68 --> 00:43:29.76
Now here's what's difficult to understand. Most likely, I can just about guarantee these officers

517
00:43:29.76 --> 00:43:37.44
that are doing this have no idea what's going on. They probably think they're doing the right

518
00:43:37.44 --> 00:43:42.32
thing, which is, hey, there's an active shooter in there. My teammates are in there killing this

519
00:43:42.32 --> 00:43:47.36
guy, so I need to make sure these civilians stay safe. That's what they're thinking. And why are they

520
00:43:47.36 --> 00:43:52.64
thinking that? Because no one in this whole scenario is detached and connecting the pieces,

521
00:43:52.64 --> 00:44:00.40
which is what needs to happen when this kind of thing goes down. Someone has got to take a step

522
00:44:00.40 --> 00:44:02.88
back and piece together what's happening and put together a plan.

523
00:44:08.72 --> 00:44:14.64
So these parents, you watch these parents, they actually are somewhat detached. The parents are

524
00:44:14.64 --> 00:44:24.16
kind of detached because they can see that there's why is the shooting continuing? Why is this happening?

525
00:44:29.12 --> 00:44:36.56
1203, please continue to arrive and a student calls 911 from inside a student calls 911 from

526
00:44:36.56 --> 00:44:44.56
room 112 for a minute and 23 seconds and identifies herself in a whisper. Meanwhile, as many as 19

527
00:44:44.56 --> 00:44:52.16
officers are positioned in the school's hallway, 19 officers. And now we know that we got kids in their

528
00:44:52.16 --> 00:45:06.16
alive and you have 19 officers. 1210, the student calls back. Student calls 911 again and says

529
00:45:06.16 --> 00:45:14.88
multiple people are dead. So now you know for sure, the shooter is a psychopath that needs to be stopped.

530
00:45:14.88 --> 00:45:30.24
That's what you know. 1213 PM, student calls 911 again. Student calls a third time.

531
00:45:30.96 --> 00:45:35.76
The 40s have not expanded on our comments during this call. 1215 Border Patrol Tactical

532
00:45:35.76 --> 00:45:42.48
Unit arrives. Border Patrol Tactical Unit members carrying shields arrive.

533
00:45:42.48 --> 00:45:50.88
And she looked, ballistic shields are a great, an awesome tool to have. For sure, they're great.

534
00:45:55.60 --> 00:45:59.20
We're not waiting for this if there's kids that are going to be killed when I wait and for shields to show up.

535
00:46:05.52 --> 00:46:11.04
1216 PM, student calls 911 once again. The student calls 911 again saying eight or nine

536
00:46:11.04 --> 00:46:21.28
students are alive. So now we know we got live kids in there and we got more than enough people to

537
00:46:21.28 --> 00:46:28.48
to make this happen. 1217 oddly enough the school announced there's an active shooter on campus.

538
00:46:28.48 --> 00:46:40.40
I mean, what's happening in our overall, from an overall leadership perspective between the

539
00:46:40.40 --> 00:46:48.08
school and the police when we have at 1217 as there's dead children, dead teachers and now we're

540
00:46:48.08 --> 00:46:59.52
announcing that we have an active shooter on campus. The all-lookers, the parents are now begging for action.

541
00:47:00.24 --> 00:47:04.64
Here's a little pull out. It's at some point during the standoff, all-lookers beg police to charge

542
00:47:04.64 --> 00:47:10.88
the school according to the Associated Press. Parents try to break windows and are not allowed

543
00:47:10.88 --> 00:47:14.88
to immediately be reunited with their children. Again, there's a video of this. It's

544
00:47:14.88 --> 00:47:20.80
sickening to watch. There's parents yelling out, what are you doing? Get inside the building. Go protect the kids.

545
00:47:27.68 --> 00:47:40.64
And there's a one mom. One mom, Angelie Rose Gomez. She gets cuffed. She gets cuffed for

546
00:47:40.64 --> 00:47:49.68
quote, intervening with an active investigation. And I can't even give this woman enough props and

547
00:47:49.68 --> 00:47:59.04
praise. She, she like pretended to calm down so that they would release her once they released her.

548
00:47:59.04 --> 00:48:04.40
She distanced herself from the crowd, got away from like all the hype and all the mania. And then she

549
00:48:04.40 --> 00:48:14.32
jumped the fence, went in and got her to kids out. Meanwhile, she said that other fathers

550
00:48:14.32 --> 00:48:34.32
got tackled, pepper sprayed and tays. Again, somebody has to take a step back and get

551
00:48:34.32 --> 00:48:40.000
control the situation and no one did that here. And is there a chance that someone in this group

552
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.84
of people, one of these police officers, happens to be a really good leader and happens to understand

553
00:48:45.84 --> 00:48:53.44
what to do in dynamic situations and happens to have the authority and the leadership skill to get

554
00:48:53.44 --> 00:48:57.52
control of the situation? Is there a chance that someone might have that? There's a chance,

555
00:48:58.08 --> 00:49:01.28
there's also a chance that no one has that. And that's why you have to train people so that they

556
00:49:01.28 --> 00:49:07.20
can perform in these situations. And by the way, the training is also screening to see what kind of

557
00:49:07.20 --> 00:49:11.68
personality people have. And see what kind of shortfalls they have as leaders. And some people

558
00:49:11.68 --> 00:49:17.68
don't have the cognitive capacity to make these decisions. And some people don't have the

559
00:49:17.68 --> 00:49:22.88
the cognitive capacity to take a step back. And some people don't have the wherewithal

560
00:49:22.88 --> 00:49:38.56
to press through in tough scenarios. And so as leaders, we need to know who those people are.

561
00:49:38.56 --> 00:49:47.76
This mom, Miss Gomez, Miss Gomez, she is that type of person to take action, to be default

562
00:49:47.76 --> 00:49:53.20
aggressive, get things solved. She was detached enough emotionally to realize she had to get away from

563
00:49:53.20 --> 00:49:57.20
the mob, get to a position where she can maneuver in. She was able to do this.

564
00:49:59.12 --> 00:50:03.52
Some people have that natural ability. Some people don't. And I'm going to get to this in a little

565
00:50:03.52 --> 00:50:10.40
bit. There's also training that has to be overcome. Sometimes people fall into training habits that

566
00:50:10.40 --> 00:50:18.88
aren't good. So we have to train to the point that we recognize when what we've been trained to do

567
00:50:18.88 --> 00:50:33.68
isn't working. 12. 19. PM. Another student calls 911 from from room 11. Hangs up when another

568
00:50:33.68 --> 00:50:43.52
student tells her to 12. 21. Gunman fires again. Authorities say he was believed to be at the

569
00:50:43.52 --> 00:50:54.16
classrooms door. On a 911 call from a student three gunshots can be heard. This is over and over again.

570
00:50:54.16 --> 00:51:04.40
Then things that would mean to me as a tactical leader we go right now. There's time after time,

571
00:51:04.40 --> 00:51:14.16
after time, after time. There's execute criteria. A room full of kids. There's a guy in there

572
00:51:14.16 --> 00:51:21.76
is shooting. You go. There's not a debate. You go. That's what you do. You go. You go through the windows.

573
00:51:21.76 --> 00:51:25.68
You breach the doors. You do whatever you got to do to get in there. That's what you do.

574
00:51:33.28 --> 00:51:38.72
12. 36. Student in room 11. Calls back again. Same student calls back for 21 seconds

575
00:51:38.72 --> 00:51:47.20
and is told to stay on the line quietly. 12.43 gunman shoots the door. The student tells 9.11 that

576
00:51:47.20 --> 00:51:54.40
the gunman shot the door. Okay. There's another execute criteria.

577
00:51:56.72 --> 00:52:03.52
And you do what you have to do to get in there. Windows. You put ladders up to the windows. You crash.

578
00:52:03.52 --> 00:52:12.72
You crash through those windows. You crash a vehicle into the windows. You shoot the door off the hinges.

579
00:52:12.72 --> 00:52:27.60
That's what you do. 12.46. I can hear the police next door. Student called 9.11. 12.46.

580
00:52:27.60 --> 00:52:35.84
Eradando gives the approval to enter. If you're all ready to do it, you do it. He says according

581
00:52:35.84 --> 00:52:54.72
to a transcript of police body cam footage. 12.46. 12.46. Over an hour.

582
00:52:54.72 --> 00:53:19.20
12.47. 911 call from a student. Please send police now. 12.50. Border Patrol Tactical Unit Officer

583
00:53:19.20 --> 00:53:26.40
Breach is the room and uses a janitor's keys and kills the gunman.

584
00:53:28.08 --> 00:53:33.44
And I don't have any details on how that actually happened yet.

585
00:53:36.24 --> 00:53:42.72
I know Bortak people, which is the Border Patrol Tactical Unit Bortak. I know them. I've actually

586
00:53:42.72 --> 00:53:49.76
worked with them a little bit. I've got some reports that they disobeyed orders. People were telling

587
00:53:49.76 --> 00:53:58.48
them not to enter and they did it. Anyways, good on them. But what I've been saying this whole time,

588
00:53:58.48 --> 00:54:05.12
go in, go in, go in, go in. And you think to yourself, well, if you go in or you're going to get

589
00:54:05.12 --> 00:54:09.44
shot, if you go in, is this going to happen? You don't know. But look what happens when these guys

590
00:54:09.44 --> 00:54:17.84
finally go in. They go in there and they kill the guy. That's what happens. You got to go on offense.

591
00:54:25.04 --> 00:54:29.04
12.51. Children are moved out of the room.

592
00:54:29.04 --> 00:54:43.04
12.51. 106 police announced the shooter is in custody because the Border Patrol and they're

593
00:54:43.04 --> 00:54:52.24
killed them. And then you vowed the police announced on Facebook that the shooter is in custody

594
00:54:52.24 --> 00:55:08.96
authorities recanted that information later. So, there you have it. What can we learn from this?

595
00:55:11.28 --> 00:55:16.72
And again, at this point in time, I'm focused on what could we learn from this tactical situation

596
00:55:16.72 --> 00:55:25.04
that unfolded? What can we learn from it? I know there's a whole bunch of a whole slew of other topics

597
00:55:25.04 --> 00:55:32.24
to talk about. And those are happening on a massive level. And those will continue to happen.

598
00:55:34.24 --> 00:55:42.32
But as an area that I actually know a decent amount about is this. So that's what I'm talking about.

599
00:55:42.32 --> 00:55:48.40
And first of all, and I've been saying this for years, police need more training.

600
00:55:52.96 --> 00:56:02.000
Police 20% of time, 20% of working hours for police should be spent training.

601
00:56:03.52 --> 00:56:08.08
That's what should happen. That's what needs to happen. And listen, you think, oh,

602
00:56:08.08 --> 00:56:12.72
that that there's now going to be less people out on patrol, less police out on patrol?

603
00:56:12.72 --> 00:56:18.32
They're their effectiveness will more than make up for the fact that there's less police on patrol.

604
00:56:18.96 --> 00:56:23.04
Who would you rather if you were in a hostage situation with some crazy person in your house?

605
00:56:23.04 --> 00:56:27.52
Who would you rather have show up 10 untrained people or 8 highly trained people?

606
00:56:29.84 --> 00:56:33.84
And if you're not sure about that, let me tell you because I guarantee you all day long, I'll

607
00:56:33.84 --> 00:56:40.48
take 8 highly trained people over 10 untrained people all day. All day.

608
00:56:46.80 --> 00:56:54.08
And I'll tell you, I am now, I've started to talk to some organizations

609
00:56:55.36 --> 00:57:01.60
to see how echelon front my company can help do this on a national level. What should this training

610
00:57:01.60 --> 00:57:04.08
consist of? What are we training? Police in?

611
00:57:05.92 --> 00:57:11.12
Well, combatives for one thing, shooting, breaching. First aid trauma.

612
00:57:13.44 --> 00:57:19.20
Deescalation. And anybody that's listening that doesn't know much about the police,

613
00:57:19.20 --> 00:57:26.000
you might think they do all this stuff all the time. They don't. They don't do this all the time.

614
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:33.28
They barely get to shoot. I bet you 99% of police have very limited training if any in breaching

615
00:57:34.56 --> 00:57:37.12
and how to breach a door with a shot gun.

616
00:57:41.92 --> 00:57:49.28
Combatives, barely any. Barely any training. Close quarters combat, room clearing.

617
00:57:49.28 --> 00:57:58.64
Urban combat clearance. How do you handle an active shooter? How do you handle a barricade

618
00:57:58.64 --> 00:58:05.92
shooter? And then you've got to run scenarios. You've got to put people into these situations.

619
00:58:07.68 --> 00:58:17.60
You've got to get a simulation or some kind of round that can be fired at other people during training.

620
00:58:17.60 --> 00:58:26.16
You need assets. You need role players so that people get used to it.

621
00:58:27.60 --> 00:58:33.04
And you absolutely get better. This is exactly what I did for a living.

622
00:58:34.40 --> 00:58:41.12
Was trained young seals so that they understand what to do in these types of situations. And you

623
00:58:41.12 --> 00:58:48.56
can watch and see them learn and get better. And over time, they eventually get to a point where

624
00:58:48.56 --> 00:59:00.16
they know exactly what to do. Yeah, they learn about the basic fundamental principles.

625
00:59:00.16 --> 00:59:03.20
Cover and move simple. Prioritize next to your decentralized command. They're going to learn about those

626
00:59:03.20 --> 00:59:07.44
things. They're going to learn about decentralized command, which means when I show up and there's

627
00:59:07.44 --> 00:59:11.52
something going on and I'm the junior guy, but I'm the first person there. I can make things happen.

628
00:59:11.52 --> 00:59:18.24
I can make decisions. I know what the priorities are. That's what they learn.

629
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.56
They learn how to detach. You've heard me say someone's got to take a step back and figure out

630
00:59:24.56 --> 00:59:29.36
what's happening broadly. Well, that's what people learn when you run them through the appropriate

631
00:59:29.36 --> 00:59:33.12
training. They learn how to communicate. They learn the importance of communications. They learn

632
00:59:33.12 --> 00:59:38.000
not to go into dynamic scenarios without a radio so they can communicate with the rest of their troops.

633
00:59:41.84 --> 00:59:49.28
This so much of this whole thing was people not seeing the big picture. No one assembled

634
00:59:49.28 --> 00:59:55.60
the entire scene to understand what was happening. And therefore no one made the broad call that

635
00:59:55.60 --> 01:00:08.40
needed to be made, which is get in there. Get in there. We're going. And this does take training.

636
01:00:10.24 --> 01:00:13.68
It does take training. Now it doesn't take training if you're a parent and your kids in there.

637
01:00:13.68 --> 01:00:19.28
That doesn't take any training. That's instinct. And I'll talk a little bit about that.

638
01:00:19.28 --> 01:00:25.52
But it takes training. I had experience seals. I would have experience seals that would fail

639
01:00:25.52 --> 01:00:29.84
to take action when they needed to. And we'd have to have them do that training again. And maybe

640
01:00:29.84 --> 01:00:33.68
again, and maybe again, until they realize that when they don't take action, everything's going to fall apart.

641
01:00:37.04 --> 01:00:41.44
So even seals would have a hard time in some cases figuring these things out.

642
01:00:41.44 --> 01:00:56.000
Now, like I said, the parents that were there, they were detached. And maybe not emotionally

643
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.76
because they're they're obviously horrified by what's going on. But some of the parents you can

644
01:01:03.76 --> 01:01:07.36
go watch the videos, they're making matter of fact statements about what was going on.

645
01:01:07.36 --> 01:01:11.68
They're saying there's kids in there. They're shooting going on.

646
01:01:16.40 --> 01:01:22.000
Now to this idea of instinct, which I mentioned, instinct versus methodology versus instinct.

647
01:01:23.28 --> 01:01:30.88
Okay, you have an instinct of what to do. And in some cases, you need to get trained against that

648
01:01:30.88 --> 01:01:39.20
instinct. It's just like in jujitsu. There's certain things where your instinct is wrong.

649
01:01:39.20 --> 01:01:45.28
And so it takes some training to teach you to overcome your instinct.

650
01:01:48.88 --> 01:01:56.16
To learn a methodology that's superior to the instinct. And there are times when the methodology

651
01:01:56.16 --> 01:02:02.24
is wrong and the instinct is correct. What do I mean by that? I got a story about JP to Nell,

652
01:02:02.24 --> 01:02:13.92
JP to Nell. One of my guys in my last deployment to Iraq. And outstanding guy, seal,

653
01:02:13.92 --> 01:02:19.68
sniper, point man, outstanding guy. And when we first started working together, we were out in the desert.

654
01:02:19.68 --> 01:02:27.68
And we're doing a patrol out in the desert. And the patrol stopped. And I'm looking at JP.

655
01:02:27.68 --> 01:02:33.68
And JP standing out in the open. He's standing out in the open. Now we're out in the desert,

656
01:02:33.68 --> 01:02:40.08
but it's not a barren desert. There's rocks and shrubs and micro-terrain features. And we stop our

657
01:02:40.08 --> 01:02:48.64
patrol and JP standing out in the open. And I walk over to him. And I said, hey, JP, if you were 10 years

658
01:02:48.64 --> 01:02:56.08
old right now and we were playing war, where would you be standing? And he pointed over to a little

659
01:02:56.08 --> 01:03:00.16
bush with some rocks rounded with a little terrain to hide behind. And he said, right over there.

660
01:03:01.52 --> 01:03:09.68
And I said, let your 10s 10 year old instinct. Let it come to life. Let it do its job. That's where you

661
01:03:09.68 --> 01:03:14.72
should be. I know the standard operating procedure is when the patrol stops. You set down

662
01:03:14.72 --> 01:03:20.88
a near position in your field of fire. You halt and you stay there. But if you can move six yards

663
01:03:20.88 --> 01:03:27.68
and have good-covering concealment, that's what you should do. So sometimes people train to a point

664
01:03:27.68 --> 01:03:33.92
like these police officers probably and I've heard some talk about this. Hey, it's a barricaded

665
01:03:33.92 --> 01:03:40.56
shooter, which means we he's going to be staying there and we should negotiate. So they got in this

666
01:03:40.56 --> 01:03:49.76
mode of well-barricaded shooter. We should just negotiate with them. The reality of the situation

667
01:03:49.76 --> 01:03:52.96
it wasn't barricaded shooter. He was moving around. He was still shooting the entire time.

668
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.40
That's not a barricaded shooter that's decided to hold up and negotiate for some kind of ransom.

669
01:03:59.92 --> 01:04:03.12
Not at all. They got stuck in that mode.

670
01:04:03.12 --> 01:04:12.72
What needed to happen was action. A methodical entry, a perfect entry into the building.

671
01:04:13.36 --> 01:04:20.56
If you were to plot out the perfect close quarters combat operation for this school and how many

672
01:04:20.56 --> 01:04:24.64
people you would need and what methodology you would move for the building and what type of breaches

673
01:04:24.64 --> 01:04:28.72
you would use on the doors and which would be most efficient. All that stuff goes out the window

674
01:04:28.72 --> 01:04:34.24
when there's an active shooter in the room with a bunch of kids, your instinct needs to be to get in there

675
01:04:35.20 --> 01:04:39.20
and some of those parents had that instinct. Yelling, get into the building.

676
01:04:43.12 --> 01:04:48.64
But the training methodology had boxed these guys in mentally. Where they thought, oh well, we don't

677
01:04:48.64 --> 01:04:55.52
have shields. And this is a speculating at this point. But oh, if we don't have ballistic shields, we

678
01:04:55.52 --> 01:05:01.12
shouldn't go in there. Hey, we were taught not to go into a shooter situation, an active shooter

679
01:05:01.12 --> 01:05:06.24
situation without ballistic shields. We're waiting for the ballistic shields. No, that's the methodology

680
01:05:06.24 --> 01:05:14.16
been talked. It's not working right now. What about the windows? Walking up to the windows, smashing

681
01:05:14.16 --> 01:05:23.04
a window, shooting through the window. You can do that throwing crash grenades through the windows.

682
01:05:23.04 --> 01:05:32.000
Put 10 crash grenades through the windows on this guy. There's a bunch of different things that

683
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.08
if you do what you would naturally do in a situation, you're probably right.

684
01:05:43.04 --> 01:05:46.56
So what you have to do is you're going to have instinct. You're going to have a natural instinct.

685
01:05:46.56 --> 01:05:49.28
The instinct could be wrong. The instinct could be right.

686
01:05:49.28 --> 01:05:53.84
I mean, here's an instinct. What's something shooting? I mean, I'm going to run away.

687
01:05:54.48 --> 01:05:59.36
And I'm not going to go back. So police officers have to overcome that instinct to go and stay

688
01:05:59.36 --> 01:06:03.12
and maneuver towards fire. That's overcoming their natural instinct.

689
01:06:05.36 --> 01:06:11.20
But there's sometimes where the methodology is wrong. And so you have to be good enough to overcome

690
01:06:11.20 --> 01:06:14.000
your methodology and go if you're instincts sometimes.

691
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.80
Are you, it's another thing I used to say to these young seals.

692
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:27.04
If you, I'd say, hey, if you were going to go in that room right now and I was in there and you

693
01:06:27.04 --> 01:06:31.28
were 10 years old and I was 10 years old and I had a squirt gun and you had a squirt gun.

694
01:06:32.24 --> 01:06:36.88
And you were going to enter this room. How would you do it? And they'd show me.

695
01:06:36.88 --> 01:06:42.24
And I'd say, doesn't that make more sense than what you just did and they'd say, yeah, it does.

696
01:06:44.48 --> 01:06:49.44
But they would follow some standard operating procedures that didn't make sense in a particular room.

697
01:06:49.44 --> 01:06:52.56
But they would do what they were taught to do even though it didn't make sense.

698
01:06:55.92 --> 01:06:59.36
And the ability to decide whether your instinct is right or wrong,

699
01:07:00.80 --> 01:07:05.20
you get that ability by being able to take a step back and assess. And the way you get that ability

700
01:07:05.20 --> 01:07:07.20
to take a step back and assess is through training.

701
01:07:13.36 --> 01:07:22.80
And it takes time. And that's why I use that term, that that idea of 20% of time for police officers

702
01:07:22.80 --> 01:07:30.24
should be spent training. And you're going to end up with infinitely more qualified and prepared police.

703
01:07:30.24 --> 01:07:43.76
There was a fighting methodology, a combatives methodology, a system that was being used in the

704
01:07:43.76 --> 01:07:51.20
seal teams. And it was ineffective. It was ineffective system. But one of the reasons that it was

705
01:07:51.20 --> 01:07:59.36
argued to be a good system was because there was a one week course of instruction of this fighting

706
01:07:59.36 --> 01:08:04.88
methodology that if you took this one week course of instruction, then you were qualified

707
01:08:06.72 --> 01:08:13.36
and allegedly prepared for combat. Well, you can't learn to fight one week. There's not going to

708
01:08:13.36 --> 01:08:22.40
happen. You can't learn good combatives skills in one week. And so I was bringing up to my chain of command.

709
01:08:22.40 --> 01:08:30.000
Hey, this combative system is ineffective. We should use some kind of a more mixed martial arts

710
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.04
combination of jujitsu wrestling boxing, mojitai using our weapons in those scenarios.

711
01:08:37.20 --> 01:08:43.20
And one of the arguments that I got against that idea was that all that stuff takes years to learn.

712
01:08:44.32 --> 01:08:47.36
It takes years to learn this stuff. This stuff we can teach people in a week.

713
01:08:47.36 --> 01:08:53.52
Well, you know what I said to that? I said, well, we're in the damn teams for 20 years.

714
01:08:53.52 --> 01:08:57.60
Let people get good. You shouldn't tell someone that after a week of training, they're going to be good

715
01:08:57.60 --> 01:09:06.24
to go. They're not training has to happen all the time. And by the way, eventually, we do have a great

716
01:09:07.44 --> 01:09:13.36
jujitsu wrestling boxing mojitai based combative system in the seal teams,

717
01:09:13.36 --> 01:09:20.48
which is you also utilize your weapons, you utilize your gear, but it's based in these things that work.

718
01:09:21.60 --> 01:09:25.60
And it takes time to get good at. No one says, oh, you've been through one week course. You can handle

719
01:09:25.60 --> 01:09:37.36
yourself now because we know that that's not true. So it comes down to training. And there's a look.

720
01:09:38.80 --> 01:09:42.80
Are there a bunch of other factors, a bunch of other things that we can address? Yes,

721
01:09:42.80 --> 01:09:47.20
there are absolutely are. There are a bunch of other things to talk about.

722
01:09:49.04 --> 01:09:53.84
But like I said, this is something that I know and something that I understand training people

723
01:09:53.84 --> 01:10:00.88
for stressful, dynamic, dangerous situations. And that's what we need to do with our law enforcement.

724
01:10:00.88 --> 01:10:10.32
We need to train them properly. Because we owe it to them. We owe it to our police and law

725
01:10:10.32 --> 01:10:15.52
enforcement to train them properly. We owe it to the law abiding citizens of this country.

726
01:10:19.12 --> 01:10:23.68
And of course, we owe it to the innocent children.

727
01:10:23.68 --> 01:10:44.64
They're just trying to get their freaking education in school. So that's my initial take on this scenario.

728
01:10:44.64 --> 01:10:56.08
Again, I talked about some of the other factors with their Cooper on our unraveling podcast.

729
01:11:00.16 --> 01:11:03.60
But I wonder who dressed this here and try and get this word out.

730
01:11:03.60 --> 01:11:21.52
With that Equitrals. Yes. You know, like, let's have some of these things happen. You hear

731
01:11:21.52 --> 01:11:28.32
of all these solutions. On the cards and schools, gun control laws. Like, you know,

732
01:11:28.32 --> 01:11:34.000
everyone has their take. What do you think are some of the solutions that off the top of your head

733
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.92
that are not practical or doable or probably wouldn't be affected that you've heard?

734
01:11:41.28 --> 01:11:47.12
There's a whole slew of things going on. And there's many facets that lead to this

735
01:11:48.48 --> 01:11:52.08
situation. As far as I don't really think too much about,

736
01:11:52.08 --> 01:11:58.32
hey, what wouldn't work. And one of the reasons why I wanted to talk about this is this is what

737
01:11:58.32 --> 01:12:02.32
I know will help in a situation like this. If you train people properly that'll be able to handle these

738
01:12:02.32 --> 01:12:08.000
situations, if you could snap your fingers and have all the schools, you know, be totally safe.

739
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.16
Of course, of course, we'll take that all day long. We don't get to operate in fantasy world.

740
01:12:14.88 --> 01:12:21.04
There's crazy mentally disturbed people out there. And if you haven't listened to that podcast,

741
01:12:21.04 --> 01:12:27.12
I did with Darrell, one of the most shocking statistics that come out came out from it was

742
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:37.92
in 1955. There were 340 inpatient beds for every 100,000 people in America. That

743
01:12:37.92 --> 01:12:48.08
needed mental health help. 340 beds forever every 100,000 citizens. Those beds were dedicated

744
01:12:48.08 --> 01:12:55.12
for mental health. They had that many available available. They were just not necessarily taken up,

745
01:12:55.12 --> 01:13:03.52
just available. So out of every 100,000 people, there's 370 inpatient mental health beds available

746
01:13:03.52 --> 01:13:20.64
in mental health facilities. In 2007, there was 17. Yeah, 17. So that's a 95% reduction in the amount

747
01:13:20.64 --> 01:13:29.28
of available mental health facilities for people that need help. And by the way, during this time,

748
01:13:29.28 --> 01:13:38.88
we've added all kinds of other crazy things into the mix with drugs, legal drugs, illegal drugs,

749
01:13:38.88 --> 01:13:48.56
prescription drugs, all kinds of media violence, whether it's social media, whether it's violent movies,

750
01:13:48.56 --> 01:13:57.60
whether it's violent videos, all that's added into the mix. The SSRIs, the isolation of

751
01:13:57.60 --> 01:14:03.76
of being on social media in the first place, the breakdown of the family structure, like all

752
01:14:03.76 --> 01:14:08.24
these things are happening. You throw those all those things into the mix and then you have less

753
01:14:09.52 --> 01:14:17.20
mental health available. That's where you end up. It's one of the things that you end up.

754
01:14:17.20 --> 01:14:22.08
So I don't know if the necessarily answered your question about what would not help.

755
01:14:22.08 --> 01:14:29.84
I try and look at what can we actually do immediately to try and start getting people in a

756
01:14:29.84 --> 01:14:35.12
better situation, getting these things freaking moving in the right direction. Yeah, yeah, I was thinking

757
01:14:35.76 --> 01:14:39.92
because I remember you said something about like you were an advocate of like having an

758
01:14:39.92 --> 01:14:44.64
armed guard at the school, right? Where they're retired military or this was a while ago.

759
01:14:44.64 --> 01:14:52.96
And then I remember hearing the option of training teachers or army in the teachers, that's

760
01:14:52.96 --> 01:15:03.52
what it was. So how do you feel about army teachers? It's the same thing. You need to train the teachers.

761
01:15:04.32 --> 01:15:08.000
Are you going to train the teachers? Because you got to train the teachers. Which,

762
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.04
can you train the teachers? Yes, you can. You can train some of them. Someone that want to get

763
01:15:11.04 --> 01:15:17.12
trained. You know, the armed guard thing, my mom was a school principal. And, and then she was

764
01:15:17.12 --> 01:15:22.40
a superintendent of schools. And I remember when these school shootings started happening,

765
01:15:22.40 --> 01:15:29.60
I was immediately like, hey, you should put there should be two dudes sitting in a closet,

766
01:15:30.64 --> 01:15:35.20
you know, with video cameras, closer to television cameras, they're watching what's going on.

767
01:15:35.20 --> 01:15:39.60
And if anything ever happens, they come out and they kill bad guy. I wish I would have been

768
01:15:39.60 --> 01:15:45.12
super vocal about it. Because some of these things would have been stopped a lot quicker.

769
01:15:47.04 --> 01:15:52.32
And then like I said, there's some people that say, well, what kind of world are we living

770
01:15:52.32 --> 01:15:56.96
into when we need to? Let me reprise that because I'm using a horrible voice. Some people say,

771
01:15:56.96 --> 01:16:01.12
hey, what kind of world are we living in? Where we have to put armed guards in a school?

772
01:16:01.68 --> 01:16:06.80
I'll tell you the world that we created. The world that we created, you need to have armed

773
01:16:06.80 --> 01:16:14.64
guards in school because we've got some serious issues, some serious cultural and societal issues

774
01:16:15.36 --> 01:16:22.48
that makes an 18 year old kid want to get a machine gun and go into a freaking school and start killing

775
01:16:22.48 --> 01:16:32.56
kids. That's what's that's why. So if you say to me, what kind of a world are we living in? Where

776
01:16:32.56 --> 01:16:38.64
we need to put armed guards in schools? I will say the United States of America. Do I like it?

777
01:16:39.20 --> 01:16:46.32
Do I like the fact that we have to do that? No. Do I like the fact that I got a, you know,

778
01:16:46.32 --> 01:16:50.80
wear a seat belt when I drive a car? Because I might crash. I don't really like it, but I'm going to do it.

779
01:16:54.80 --> 01:16:59.36
I remember I was in high school when they were security there. They didn't have. They

780
01:16:59.36 --> 01:17:03.12
weren't armed that I knew of, but I feel like granted this is high school, so I'll let me

781
01:17:03.12 --> 01:17:10.24
just go a little bit different. And I'm thinking back if they were armed, I don't think that would

782
01:17:10.24 --> 01:17:16.32
have made that much of a difference. If they were like prison guards, like, you know, ordering

783
01:17:16.32 --> 01:17:20.72
to actually use security guards are pretty mean too to everybody. They were like hosts, you know,

784
01:17:20.72 --> 01:17:26.24
I'd envision it where they should be nice, like almost like, nice teachers almost kind of a

785
01:17:26.24 --> 01:17:30.32
thing like shapper on, you know, sometimes teachers get like yard duty. That's what they call

786
01:17:30.32 --> 01:17:39.36
the school where they got in monitors. It was awesome. No, it's like, well, I'm tired. It's so

787
01:17:39.36 --> 01:17:43.52
elementary school teaches up yard duty, right, certain ones. And basically they just got

788
01:17:43.52 --> 01:17:47.76
sight and recess and just make sure no one acts up or whatever. And no one really acts. Yeah.

789
01:17:47.76 --> 01:17:51.20
Yeah. So what you're talking about is people that are people that are employed at the school

790
01:17:51.20 --> 01:17:55.28
to keep the students in check. Yes. There's a difference between someone that's at school to keep

791
01:17:55.28 --> 01:17:58.80
the students in check and someone that's at school to prevent someone from coming to harm

792
01:17:58.80 --> 01:18:03.52
the students. Yeah. So there's a two different people you'd be looking for. Yes. But in in high school,

793
01:18:03.52 --> 01:18:07.92
one thing with the security, that's what these, and actually there were ladies, two of them.

794
01:18:07.92 --> 01:18:14.56
And they were there. Yes. For to keep people in check in all capacities. But what I'm saying is

795
01:18:14.56 --> 01:18:22.000
maybe one or two levels more advanced, we'll say, is instead of two ladies with just radios,

796
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:32.08
they were retired military or guys with guns. Not necessarily over with radios. But their presence is

797
01:18:32.08 --> 01:18:36.56
kind of known or whatever. It's not intimidating. It's more of a host kind of scenario.

798
01:18:37.68 --> 01:18:43.76
Like someone who's on the kids side kind of a thing, more so than someone with their eagle eyes open

799
01:18:43.76 --> 01:18:47.20
for any trouble, that kind of thing. Even though that is what they're doing, that's not their

800
01:18:47.20 --> 01:18:52.16
presence. That's not what it feels like. Yeah. You need to be careful with that. If you're going to

801
01:18:52.16 --> 01:18:56.48
have someone that's going to be doing security, they should be doing security. Look, can someone be

802
01:18:56.48 --> 01:19:02.32
dual rolled? Sure. But if you're going to put someone on security, like their purpose is security,

803
01:19:02.32 --> 01:19:06.56
you don't want them breaking up fights over potato chips in the school yard. You know what I'm saying?

804
01:19:06.56 --> 01:19:09.60
Yeah. You want them to be focused on what they're supposed to be focused on.

805
01:19:09.60 --> 01:19:15.12
The good, is it smart to have people that are dual trained? Sure. But someone has to be,

806
01:19:15.12 --> 01:19:18.48
if you put someone on security for the purpose of being on security, they should be on security.

807
01:19:19.60 --> 01:19:23.60
Now, like you said, and like I said, this doesn't mean they need to be walking around with body

808
01:19:23.60 --> 01:19:31.12
armor, visible body armor, and a weapon, and a salt rifle like posted up. They don't need to be

809
01:19:31.12 --> 01:19:38.000
like that. But they, I mean, they could literally be sitting in a central location and a closet with

810
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:45.20
closed circuit TVs, and when something like this happens, they know what to do. I remember the

811
01:19:45.20 --> 01:19:52.24
the army, the teachers, um, option, and I remember, uh, kind of talking to some of our friends

812
01:19:52.24 --> 01:19:56.72
that are actual teachers, and it kind of put things into perspective, because at first I was like,

813
01:19:56.72 --> 01:20:00.000
yeah, that makes sense. You know, it's not like, you know, give me just a little bit of training,

814
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.80
whatever. But at least it's one more good guy in the field, you know, with, you know, who's armed

815
01:20:04.80 --> 01:20:10.88
in can protect, but then I thought about after talking to some of the teachers, you think about it,

816
01:20:10.88 --> 01:20:16.16
like who wants to become a teacher, and then now becoming a teacher becomes a whole different thing.

817
01:20:16.16 --> 01:20:20.000
Like right now it's like, I'm a teacher. I want to teach these young minds, you know,

818
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.12
to get to the next level in life, and all this, like basically all the things that people pursue

819
01:20:25.12 --> 01:20:31.60
being teachers, yeah, over, um, it shifts to something completely different. Yeah, that being said,

820
01:20:31.60 --> 01:20:37.20
I bet if there was an option where if you're a school teacher, you can go to a four-week

821
01:20:37.20 --> 01:20:44.000
summer course on, you know, active shooter response, and then inside of a school with

822
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
30 teachers, there's three people that have been to this course. I think we're, I think I'm feeling

823
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.80
good about that. Yeah. Yeah. And then you were a refresher course every summer, and that you know what I'm

824
01:20:52.80 --> 01:20:59.68
saying, like, you got, you got to train people, you have to train people properly, but people are

825
01:20:59.68 --> 01:21:04.64
willing to train, because it's beneficial in a multitude of different ways. Yeah, that's it.

826
01:21:04.64 --> 01:21:08.56
I never thought about that where it's like kind of the optional training or whatever, because

827
01:21:08.56 --> 01:21:13.28
I was just thinking of it in terms of like, hey, because it's how they, they'd say, I don't, you know,

828
01:21:13.28 --> 01:21:17.12
they don't go into depth or nothing. They're just like, yeah, I'm the teacher, like all the teachers,

829
01:21:17.12 --> 01:21:21.76
they got guns. Yeah. So, so to your earlier question is like, what's a solution that won't work?

830
01:21:21.76 --> 01:21:27.20
The problem with that is the, the problem with that is the details of any solution. You take

831
01:21:27.20 --> 01:21:32.08
any one of these solutions, and there's certain details that would make it better, and some details

832
01:21:32.08 --> 01:21:36.64
if you don't include them, are going to make it a disaster. Like you just throw weapons into every

833
01:21:36.64 --> 01:21:40.64
classroom with random people that haven't been trained, you, you, that's, that's going to be a

834
01:21:40.64 --> 01:21:45.28
problem. Right? Because you got teachers that are that are that are that micro crazy. Right?

835
01:21:45.28 --> 01:21:52.08
There's all kinds of things going on. So, you take any of these solutions, and you take it to a certain

836
01:21:52.08 --> 01:21:57.76
extent. I mean, some of the ways of looking at things can be so different depending on who you are,

837
01:21:58.72 --> 01:22:04.000
that like what's the term they use, reasonable gun control. Reasonable gun control means completely

838
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.24
different things to different people depending on who you are and what you're background is. So true.

839
01:22:08.24 --> 01:22:14.56
And so to just say, hey, we should have reasonable gun control, like I said, that means completely

840
01:22:14.56 --> 01:22:21.36
different things depending on who you're talking to. Yeah. So, that's why for this, for this, I just

841
01:22:21.36 --> 01:22:26.56
want to talk about, hey, here's something I do know about and here's pragmatic solution that will

842
01:22:26.56 --> 01:22:33.68
help and it should be, it should, it should be implemented. Right? That's what you have because

843
01:22:33.68 --> 01:22:37.44
there, there's guys and, you know, this is going to come as an surprise, but when you put into

844
01:22:37.44 --> 01:22:44.08
perspective, where there are people who at six years old, they got their first gun. Six. Yeah.

845
01:22:44.08 --> 01:22:51.12
Yeah. Then same country, same state a lot of time. Maybe even same neighborhood. There are people who

846
01:22:51.12 --> 01:22:56.72
have never shot a gun ever in their life and they're like 60 years old. Yeah. So, you figure someone

847
01:22:56.72 --> 01:23:02.72
who's never shot a gun, never handled the gun or whatever. The idea of a gun potentially can be like,

848
01:23:02.72 --> 01:23:10.64
that is just a death tool. That is just a object of death. So, they just don't know, you know.

849
01:23:10.64 --> 01:23:15.84
And then versus the guy who got their gun at six and guns are all around the house and cases

850
01:23:15.84 --> 01:23:20.32
and the truck and all this stuff where it's like, no, it's not a thing. A death is just a tool

851
01:23:20.32 --> 01:23:25.28
just like a sword hammer or something like that. Where, you know, obviously people say this all the

852
01:23:25.28 --> 01:23:28.64
time where it's like, hey, you know, if someone kills someone with a hammer, you don't outlaw

853
01:23:28.64 --> 01:23:34.40
hammers. It's like they literally feel guns are the same exact category. Seems same. But then

854
01:23:34.40 --> 01:23:38.80
the guy, the person who's never shot a gun, how he's going to feel is like, no, a hammer is to hit

855
01:23:38.80 --> 01:23:44.000
nails. If someone gets all crazy and start hitting heads with it, that's different. Guns are

856
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.88
made to shoot people kind of a thing. That's their attitude, you know, or how they feel about it.

857
01:23:48.88 --> 01:23:52.88
So it's like, yeah, then, okay, now, okay, now we need laws now, right? For the guns,

858
01:23:52.88 --> 01:23:57.44
but these laws apply to everybody. The six year old guy or the gun is gun at six.

859
01:23:58.32 --> 01:24:02.40
And also the guy who's never shot a gun ever in his life, these laws have to apply to both people.

860
01:24:02.40 --> 01:24:06.16
So it's hard to land those laws, you know, effectively where everyone's going to like them.

861
01:24:06.16 --> 01:24:11.76
Yeah, it's very hard. And what makes it even hard to resist that the two sides don't talk to

862
01:24:11.76 --> 01:24:17.20
each other in a reasonable way to try and figure out what would be a reasonable solution.

863
01:24:17.20 --> 01:24:22.56
Yeah, man. So there I am using the reasonable gun laws myself. He's not done.

864
01:24:22.56 --> 01:24:26.40
In big, it's term. Yeah, it's true. Well, and then, yeah, because you kind of,

865
01:24:27.20 --> 01:24:31.84
it makes sense on a certain level, even though it's still not effective, right? Where,

866
01:24:31.84 --> 01:24:36.64
let's say I got a gun. My first gun at six, you know, 22 rifle,

867
01:24:36.64 --> 01:24:41.60
different trick and awesome. I grow up all kinds of guns, right? I have all kinds of guns

868
01:24:41.60 --> 01:24:45.92
of shot. My kids shoot guns, all this stuff. And then you have someone, a whole family of people who live

869
01:24:45.92 --> 01:24:50.32
next door or whatever, across the street. And they have never shot a gun ever in their life and

870
01:24:50.32 --> 01:24:55.92
their scared of them. So now they're like, hey, you know, we'll just say highly intimidated or something like that.

871
01:24:55.92 --> 01:25:02.64
So they come about in their, like, oh my gosh, like a gun or whatever. And then the person who's used

872
01:25:02.64 --> 01:25:06.64
to guns are like, how you're kind of being dumb. You're kind of being unreasonable right now.

873
01:25:06.64 --> 01:25:10.32
Like this gun, you have to pull the trigger shoot. You know, point out something, pull the trigger

874
01:25:10.32 --> 01:25:13.92
for it to shoot, whatever. It doesn't just automatically kill people, right?

875
01:25:13.92 --> 01:25:20.08
So the year dumb for being scared about that kind of stuff, the, it's reasonable that that would

876
01:25:20.08 --> 01:25:26.08
that feeling would kind of take place. You seem saying. And then you have the opposite feeling where

877
01:25:26.08 --> 01:25:32.24
it's like, oh, you guys are gun nuts. Like, you have like, you have 50 guns, 50. I've never shot

878
01:25:32.24 --> 01:25:39.52
a gun in my life. I'm scared of guns and you have 50 of them. Is it unreasonable for me to be uncomfortable?

879
01:25:39.52 --> 01:25:45.36
I feel like that seems pretty normal. It's what I'm saying. So I'm saying like that conflict makes

880
01:25:45.36 --> 01:25:50.80
sense to me. Yeah, there's just a total disconnect. Yeah, ineffective, ineffective for solving problems.

881
01:25:50.80 --> 01:25:54.96
But it's, you can kind of see how it happened. No, you can, you can see how the disconnect occurs.

882
01:25:54.96 --> 01:26:02.000
But it's a disconnect. And the problem with the disconnect occurs when you don't make any attempts

883
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:10.16
to connect. And I just look at you and say, oh, you are a gun nut and you're crazy. And you know,

884
01:26:10.16 --> 01:26:16.48
I just, it just falls apart. And you look at me thinking, oh, you're a person that wants to take

885
01:26:16.48 --> 01:26:22.48
all my guns away. And so I'm just not talking to you. Yes, you're some chicken, some, you know,

886
01:26:22.48 --> 01:26:33.12
incapable chicken, trying to take away all, you know, my guns. Yeah, disconnect. With that,

887
01:26:34.40 --> 01:26:39.28
if you want to support this podcast, you can go to jockelfuel.com and get yourself some,

888
01:26:39.84 --> 01:26:45.60
get yourself some stuff to make yourself prepared from a physical sense. Because we got to be

889
01:26:45.60 --> 01:26:50.88
prepared mentally. How do you do that? You do that through good training. You got to be prepared physically.

890
01:26:50.88 --> 01:26:57.36
How do you do that? Do good workouts. Train you jitsu. And eat some good food. Take some good

891
01:26:57.36 --> 01:27:03.36
supplementation. Yeah, the training thing the more you think about it. And this might be obvious to

892
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:07.28
you. But the more you think about you understand how deep training and how valuable training in

893
01:27:07.28 --> 01:27:12.88
every single way. Like you get someone untrained in a situation. I don't even matter the situation.

894
01:27:12.88 --> 01:27:19.04
I don't care if it's swimming in the pool. Okay. So if someone jumps in the pool falls in the pool,

895
01:27:19.04 --> 01:27:25.68
they can't swim or they can't swim very well at all. Now, it's dangerous for them. Now you get

896
01:27:25.68 --> 01:27:30.48
a normal person who just knows how to swim, try to go jump in their encevil. They could get dry. They

897
01:27:30.48 --> 01:27:38.000
could both die now. Now you get one, one person trained. Probably can save everybody. Yeah, exactly.

898
01:27:39.44 --> 01:27:44.88
So, Ben, you can take the most arbitrary thing, seemingly. And you train someone, you're better off.

899
01:27:44.88 --> 01:27:52.48
Yeah, it's weird how people, like the funny thing is to start with leadership because, you know,

900
01:27:52.48 --> 01:27:57.12
I teach leadership. And people think that they should already know how to lead. And so then you start

901
01:27:57.12 --> 01:28:01.60
breaking it down from you like, oh damn, I don't know what I'm doing. Fighting. People think they just

902
01:28:01.60 --> 01:28:06.08
know how to fight. Oh, punch him. When I start to see red, better look out. No, it's like, oh, you

903
01:28:06.08 --> 01:28:11.44
roll with someone that's, you know, a jitsu player or a real boxer. Yeah. Then you go to square off with

904
01:28:11.44 --> 01:28:17.68
somebody. If you've never boxed before and you square off with a boxer, you're done. You're done.

905
01:28:17.68 --> 01:28:20.64
You're done. You're done. You're done. You're done. You get one kick. One kick. If you don't

906
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:25.68
train more time, you get kicked in the leg one time. Yeah. There's a decent chance you're done fighting.

907
01:28:25.68 --> 01:28:30.16
Yes, sir. Well, from a leg kick, yes, sir. There's a decent chance you call it right there. You're

908
01:28:30.16 --> 01:28:37.12
like, all right, this ain't happened. Yeah. So anything that you do, you, if you want to be good at

909
01:28:37.12 --> 01:28:44.64
something, you know, the, the thing I always use is guitar. There's no more reason that you would be

910
01:28:44.64 --> 01:28:49.20
able to fight or lead without training, then you would be able to play a guitar without training.

911
01:28:49.20 --> 01:28:55.76
Mm-hmm. It doesn't, you just can't, you can't win. You know, like, someone that played basketball

912
01:28:55.76 --> 01:29:00.72
will beat someone that didn't play basketball 100% of the time. Yeah, the best of all when I think

913
01:29:00.72 --> 01:29:05.04
is really good because when you see someone playing basketball, you'd be like, yeah, you just take

914
01:29:05.04 --> 01:29:10.24
that ball, you can't hold it, you got to dribble it or whatever, bounce it and you put in that hoop.

915
01:29:10.24 --> 01:29:14.88
Like, I know what to do. No, when you go try doing it, you're like, you can't even do it. Yeah. Again,

916
01:29:14.88 --> 01:29:18.08
like, if someone's trying to do it too with you or against you, whatever, you can't even do it.

917
01:29:18.08 --> 01:29:22.08
Yeah. So imagine getting a gun that you don't know what to do with it, but you think you know what to

918
01:29:22.08 --> 01:29:26.48
do with it. You know, you think you're just going to shoot or you think that there's going to be a

919
01:29:26.48 --> 01:29:31.44
dynamic situation and an active shooter and you think you're going to know what to do or you think

920
01:29:31.44 --> 01:29:35.12
people are going to be panicking and you think you're not going to be panicking. Yeah. You have to

921
01:29:35.12 --> 01:29:41.28
train and everything that you do. Think about, even you who's kind of trained in a lot of things,

922
01:29:42.08 --> 01:29:48.08
think about how many things like the normal person is trained in pretty much nothing. Yeah, not much.

923
01:29:48.08 --> 01:29:53.84
It's like if you have highly like, if you're highly trained in two things, you're like a jack of

924
01:29:53.84 --> 01:29:58.80
all trades almost kind of a thing. Think about it. But we're not trained in anything. Oh,

925
01:29:58.80 --> 01:30:06.56
but I am. You are. Should you have to think about like all the things to be trained in and I'm not

926
01:30:06.56 --> 01:30:14.16
saying expert. I'm just saying trained. You have like good usable training. What four things?

927
01:30:14.88 --> 01:30:17.92
Five maybe? Yeah. At the most even.

Jockelfield.com. Check it out. Got all by the way, new flavors. Yeah. Updated. Yeah. This is on me.

930
01:30:33.84 --> 01:30:38.72
On me. All right. Yes. You know, I wrote a book called Extreme Ownership. Yeah. Well,

931
01:30:38.72 --> 01:30:44.96
guess what? The early flavors. My fault. Well, here. This is what you did. I understand. I

932
01:30:44.96 --> 01:30:48.64
thought about this. This is what you did. This is all you did. It tastes good. So you know, when you're

933
01:30:49.36 --> 01:30:54.24
when you're young, right? Yeah. Did you ever have those, you know, like on orange juice or whatever

934
01:30:54.24 --> 01:31:00.40
the concentrate, you know, the one where it's like a frozen like sleeve. Yeah. Exactly. And you put it

935
01:31:00.40 --> 01:31:05.44
and you mix water. Right. So if you look at the dirt. Okay. So my mom, my mom, guys, would get that

936
01:31:05.44 --> 01:31:10.64
for us. Right. Orange juice. So it's like four to one or something. Yes. So that's what they did.

937
01:31:10.64 --> 01:31:16.08
They did four. They filled it up four times and put it in the pitcher. Right. The jug or whatever.

938
01:31:16.08 --> 01:31:21.28
So my uncle, sweet. Later on when I grew up in high school, I look at it. I look at the directions.

939
01:31:21.28 --> 01:31:29.28
It's three to one. Seems like they were given us the more watered down version of it. We liked it.

940
01:31:29.28 --> 01:31:33.12
Love it. Because that's what we were used to. Yeah. Seems like. But I tasted the three to one.

941
01:31:33.12 --> 01:31:35.68
I was like, probably this is a little bit too concentrated, a little bit too sweet for me.

942
01:31:35.68 --> 01:31:40.88
Yeah. That's what you did. Yeah. Because they're all used to water. Yeah. It was your main drink

943
01:31:40.88 --> 01:31:45.84
of choice. So you're like, oh, you put some monk fruit in this new energy drink. All this stuff.

944
01:31:45.84 --> 01:31:50.64
It seems like sweet. Sweet. Sweet. To me, you got the four to one going. Yeah. But the three to

945
01:31:50.64 --> 01:31:55.52
one is more our speed. I think a lot of us. It's in. Yeah. It's really like a total. It's almost like

946
01:31:55.52 --> 01:32:01.44
it's almost like I was like nine to one. So anyways, we got all all new flavors. All new flavors.

971
01:34:25.28 --> 01:34:31.92
controversy behind it. I'm just to say as it turns out some there was a design that a guy emailed in

972
01:34:33.12 --> 01:34:38.72
seemingly nice guy. I don't know obviously but emailed in said hey his wife was offended by the shirt.

Oh dang he needs to return it. Which one is it everyone must get stoned? No. Which one was it?

01:34:50.80 --> 01:34:57.68
anarchy. I think he knew my head like well good. Okay but I'm just saying. So you made one to

976
01:34:57.68 --> 01:35:03.76

977
01:35:03.76 --> 01:35:09.04
resemblance. Yeah. Dude it was just kind of a merely a resemblance. It was the straight-up shit.

978
01:35:09.04 --> 01:35:13.92
Oh my be honest it was an homage to the anarchy symbol. There you go. It was straight up. It served

979
01:35:13.92 --> 01:35:19.12
its purpose. I'm just saying it was controversial apparently. Yeah. There you go. Okay. You get those

border patrol, shout out, get in the done secret service. All first responders. Listen, you have a

1008
01:38:04.08 --> 01:38:12.16
complex grinding job that requires you to be a family counselor one minute and a tactical

1009
01:38:12.16 --> 01:38:20.24
assaulter the next. And it's a hard job. And we thank you for what you do. And we want to get to

1011
01:38:31.76 --> 01:38:38.56
Evil that we cannot understand. Evil that will attack a schoolhouse filled with children.

1012
01:38:39.20 --> 01:38:47.92
Evil that will kill innocent children and kill schoolteachers. And we certainly need to

1013
01:38:47.92 --> 01:38:55.36
more than that loss. But we also need to remember that evil is still out there.

1014
01:38:57.52 --> 01:39:03.76
And we need to do what we can to be prepared for the next time at Rears. It's ugly head.
