00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 74 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick. Good evening, I go. Good evening.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, I always dug music.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I'm pretty sure it started when my dad would play Hank Williams' senior on the eight track in his,

4
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I think it was a 1971 barracuda.

5
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And he played that trait that tape just over and over again.

6
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I still know those songs by heart. And then you know I got that was when I was a little kid.

7
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And then I got a little bit older.

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And like a lot of kids, all of a sudden I was listening to the Beatles.

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Sure.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Elvis.

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Thank you.

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Thought they were great.

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I still think that song while Mike at Tarjant Lee Weeps is a good song.

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But that wore out kind of quickly.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And there was something wasn't there in that music.

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Something just wasn't quite there.

17
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The music didn't sound how I felt.

18
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And then in 1980, A C D C back and black came out.

19
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And it was popular, right? It was just popular.

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And so it went into my ears at some point.

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And I said,

22
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
All right, better.

23
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Closer.

24
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Warmer.

25
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We're getting there.

26
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And then I watched around in the hard rock for a while.

27
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Hendrix.

28
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Led Zeppelin.

29
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And I can't help throwing it on a little jack black when I say that.

30
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If you watch that tribute that he did to them.

31
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And that, you know, some of the kids that I hung around with in New England,

32
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
they rode that train down to hippie them.

33
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You know, we're talking, Crosby stills a national Janice Joplin in the Grailful Dead and all that.

34
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I couldn't relate.

35
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Wasn't there? Didn't get there.

36
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Didn't seem to reflect the world that I was beginning to see myself.

37
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I got on the other train.

38
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And we're talking about Van Halen.

39
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Yes, this is the 1980s.

40
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
You know, if you were a kid in America, age 13, we got issued the album 1984 by Van Halen.

41
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
That was just a given you were going to get that.

42
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Got issued diver down.

43
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Boom, you can use the list of this.

44
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This is rock and roll, people.

45
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This is Eddie Van Halen.

46
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Listen to that guitar.

47
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So you're up.

48
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Listen again.

49
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You would again.

50
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Iron Maiden.

51
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Right?

52
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Actual song called Trooper.

53
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You know you got to listen to that when you're a kid.

54
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And so now I'm heading to the right direction.

55
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm feeling it.

56
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Starting to reflect what things are like in my head.

57
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And then it was that day where I got an album called Black Sabbath by a band called Black Sabbath.

58
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And this first song is also called Black Sabbath.

59
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And I put that on.

60
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And boom.

61
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I found something that sounded like I was thinking.

62
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And from there, I was definitely on the right train.

63
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Then it was motorhead.

64
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And soon after the Ramones boom.

65
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And then that leads to the sex pistols.

66
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Because you're just going harder.

67
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
That's what you do.

68
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
That's what I was doing.

69
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
What's a little bit harder than that?

70
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
What's a little bit harder than that?

71
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Sex pistols.

72
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Bodies.

73
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
No feelings.

74
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
They're singing songs.

75
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
No feelings.

76
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Okay.

77
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I hear what you're saying.

78
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
louder.

79
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
More anger.

80
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And then.

81
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Find me.

82
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We get to Black Flag.

83
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
My war.

84
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Side two.

85
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Still one of my all time favorites.

86
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Minor threat.

87
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Get a hold of a little band.

88
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Another little band from DC called the Bad Brains.

89
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Some Detroit hardcore negative approach.

90
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And then.

91
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So I was, you know, I was kind of in the game, right?

92
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I was there.

93
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And so now 87 rolls around.

94
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And one of my friends who is actually more of a metal head at this time.

95
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000
He gives me a cassette tape because this is a darkened dirty when you were just going to have to listen to cassette tapes and they were usually dubbed 47 times from somebody else.

96
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
But this was the real tape.

97
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And this is the real deal.

98
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
This is an actual original with the phone cover on it, everything.

99
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And the cover of this tape was just a giant mushroom cloud of death and destruction.

100
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And above the mushroom cloud.

101
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
In large, old English script blazing across the top.

102
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It said.

103
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Chrome mags.

104
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Okay.

105
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And then underneath the mushroom cloud.

106
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And a little bit smaller script and old English.

107
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It said the age of coral.

108
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Okay.

109
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So I put it in my tape deck.

110
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Sure.

111
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And I press play.

112
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And the first track.

113
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It hit me like a train.

114
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And it's the first track was called We Got to Know.

115
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And let me just tell you the lyrics.

116
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Struggling in the streets just trying to survive.

117
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Searching for the truth just to keep us alive.

118
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Got to break these shackles.

119
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Got to break these chains.

120
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The only way we'll do it is if we use our brains.

121
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
There's got to be some meaning to the purpose of life.

122
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I know there must be more than the struggle and strife.

123
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I'm not going to be able to do anything for the answers.

124
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And I need a clue.

125
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But my mind is still disturbed.

126
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Now what do I do?

127
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Now I can tell you.

128
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I was not struggling in the streets.

129
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But like most teenage kids.

130
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I did feel some shackles, right?

131
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You feel the shackles of things.

132
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And I was looking for answers.

133
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And I needed a clue.

134
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And so I was like, yeah.

135
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
We're on to something.

136
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But I had me a little worried.

137
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
A little concerned.

138
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Because like I said, there was a lot of kids who'd taken the hippie route.

139
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And so I was not into that.

140
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The next song titled had me a little concerned.

141
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It was the song was called World Peace.

142
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
As I was kind of red flag.

143
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And then I listened to lyrics.

144
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
All you hippies better start to face reality.

145
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Are you all your far fetched dreams of anarchy?

146
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Better start to see things.

147
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
The way they are, because the way things are going.

148
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
They won't be going far.

149
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
World peace can't be done.

150
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
It just can exist.

151
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
World peace can't be done.

152
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Anarchy is a mess.

153
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Okay.

154
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And the rest of the album kept up that assault on my brain,

155
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
on my attitude.

156
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And that was it.

157
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I had found something called Hardcore music.

158
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And I never really left it.

159
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And I listened to Chromeags.

160
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And a ton of other hardcore bands from that time.

161
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Until now, and that's pretty much essentially the soundtrack of much of my life.

162
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And it had a pretty big influence on me.

163
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And it was an attitude that I kept throughout my life.

164
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And it was my own interpretation.

165
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I can tell you that right now.

166
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
It was my own kind of, you know, you listened to the lyrics.

167
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And you kind of apply what it means in your world.

168
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
That's what I did.

169
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Which to me was pretty simple.

170
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Because to me, Hardcore meant Hardcore.

171
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
That's what it meant.

172
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It's pretty simple.

173
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Hardcore and everything you do.

174
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Work hard.

175
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Be aggressive.

176
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Don't back down.

177
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Fight for what you believe in.

178
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Hold the line.

179
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And that's kind of what I did in my life.

180
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And I don't know, like a year ago or something.

181
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Somebody asked me something about, you know, on on the interwebs.

182
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Someone said, oh, you know what, what, what, what band should I listen to?

183
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
They know I said, oh, blah, blah, Chromex.

184
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
You know, check them out, whatever.

185
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And you might want to do that.

186
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And eventually, you know, it's the internet is an incredible thing.

187
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And eventually, I, I, the founding member of the Chromex,

188
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Guy by the name of Hardly Flanagan.

189
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Sure.

190
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
He, like, reached out and said, hey, what's up, man?

191
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
How are you doing?

192
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And I had heard over the years, you know, that Harley was,

193
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
had to jitter, jitter guy, black belt, and jitter.

194
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And so, you know, he just kind of hit me up.

195
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And eventually, you know, we were talking and he said, hey,

196
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I got a book coming out, it's under two.

197
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And I said, cool.

198
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Yeah, and he said, man, the books crazy.

199
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And I was kind of like, yeah, you know, yeah, I know, man,

200
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
because you know, I was around that school.

201
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I get it.

202
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It's kind of crazy.

203
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And he's like, no, no, no, man, it's, it's crazy.

204
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And I said, okay, cool.

205
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So he sent it to me.

206
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And then I read the book and,

207
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
damn, just, I had, I had no idea.

208
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Actually, I had a semblance of an idea, you know,

209
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
because in, in the Hardcore scene,

210
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
people know each other.

211
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I mean, like, you know that, you know,

212
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
after I show you, talked to everyone.

213
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And it's the band members, it's people.

214
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Everyone kind of knows each other.

215
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So I had heard stories.

216
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But the book, when the reality behind the stories

217
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
was, was way more intense and crazy than I could

218
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
of, I thought it was.

219
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And it was one point when I was reading the book,

220
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I'm a read a little excerpt right now.

221
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And it, it said this, this is Hardly.

222
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
When I started working on this book,

223
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I was staying in a hotel in the Red Light District

224
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
in Amsterdam.

225
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
The working title was the longest suicide

226
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
note ever written.

227
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I was trying to document the madness

228
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
from as far back as I could remember until the end.

229
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
The story of my life,

230
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
as an insane, suicidal, joy-ride

231
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
of rock and roll, the prairie,

232
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and demise until the final crash in burn.

233
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It was going to be a book that all the great fuckups

234
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
never got to write because they died first.

235
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So I began working on it.

236
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I figured the end would have come sooner than later.

237
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
But I was wrong.

238
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And once I got done reading the book,

239
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I reached out to Hardly and I said, hey man,

240
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
there's a lot in this book that's crazy.

241
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And the fact that you live through it,

242
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and the fact that you got through it,

243
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and the fact that you got to the position that you're in now

244
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
with your life, I think a lot of people can learn from it

245
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and to be awesome if you come onto the podcast.

246
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And Hardly said, let's do it.

247
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So Hardly Flanagan, welcome to the show, man.

248
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
It's great to be here.

249
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Thank you for having me on.

250
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Yeah, it's awesome.

251
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And I saw you several times when I was a kid,

252
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and we were trying to figure out names of clubs where I saw you.

253
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
But that was pretty cool and it's pretty cool to be sitting here.

254
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
I guess we're talking about 30 years later.

255
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
You know, I was seeing you when I was in my teens,

256
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
14, 13, 15 around there.

257
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And here we are.

258
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Pretty amazing trip we've had since died.

259
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Yeah.

260
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And usually I, when I ask people,

261
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
you know, talk about where you come from,

262
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
quickly and kind of where you grew up,

263
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and we don't spend a lot of time there,

264
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
because most people didn't really do anything significant

265
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that had any long term impact on their lives.

266
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
When they're like, eight, nine, ten years old, right?

267
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
But for you,

268
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I mean, when you were eight, nine, ten years old,

269
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
shit was already crazy.

270
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Yeah, yeah.

271
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
She was pretty much crazy from the start.

272
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Yeah.

273
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I'm going to just kind of pull a little something here out of the book,

274
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
just to give a little bit of background.

275
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
This is from Harley's book Hardcore Life of My Own.

276
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I was born at San Francisco General Hospital on March 8, 1967

277
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
at the start of the summer of love.

278
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
My mom's name is Rose Marie Foulou, Fellou.

279
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And my dad's name was Harley Wayne Walker,

280
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Flanagan.

281
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
My mom was a hippie.

282
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
My dad was a drifter,

283
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and somehow their paths crossed.

284
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Before the hippie days,

285
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
my mom was into all the early rock and roll stuff,

286
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Motown, and pretty much all the music that was happening when she was young.

287
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Her father, Juan Fellou?

288
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Yes, Juan Fellou.

289
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Juan Fellou came from the DR, the Dominican Republic,

290
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
came to America through Ellis Island by himself.

291
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
When he was in his early teens,

292
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and one of the first, was one of the first

293
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
to medications to join the United States Army,

294
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
served in World War II,

295
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
where he played in the military band.

296
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
That's how he got his citizenship by serving in the military.

297
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
He was one of the funniest people I ever knew.

298
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
He worked all kinds of different jobs,

299
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
everything from building a building super,

300
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
to a long storm, and he was a charming guy with a thick,

301
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Spanish accent.

302
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So that's the beginnings.

303
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Did you speak any Spanish?

304
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I curse a little bit, that's not it.

305
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So you got that?

306
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Now you continue on my mom,

308
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
was a go-go dancer.

309
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And like so many people,

310
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
she was caught up in the whole drug culture of the 60s.

311
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And when I was a kid,

312
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
she was still a stripper.

313
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I remember going to work with her a few times,

314
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and I was little.

315
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
That was weird,

316
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
looking back on it now.

317
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
There was even a short period of time

318
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
when she was a dominatrix,

319
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
but that was later.

320
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
My dad left home for good around the same age as me.

321
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Maybe 14 or 15 and started writing freight trains.

322
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
He liked to live for a moment to moment.

323
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And from everything I've heard,

324
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
he had a serious drug and alcohol issues

325
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
most of his life.

326
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
He was always in and out of prison.

327
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
It's hard to accept that your dad chose

328
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
heroin and alcohol over you.

329
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
It really does kind of hurt even now.

330
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I guess that might be one of the reasons

331
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
why I turned out the way I did.

332
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
My mom and me did a lot of hitchhiking

333
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and stayed with a lot of different people.

334
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
A lot of crazy shit happened on those trips.

335
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
At one point, a friend of hers was going to Europe

336
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and asked,

337
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
do you want to come? And my mom was like,

338
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

339
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
She did and I went with her.

340
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
I was probably around three or four.

341
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
That was that.

342
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I never saw my father again.

343
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I stayed in Europe pretty much until I was about 10,

344
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
but I come back to the States every year or so.

345
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
We settled down in Denmark,

346
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
1971.

347
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Denmark and Danish culture are very wholesome.

348
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
It's a great place to grow up.

349
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
But of course, there's an underside too.

350
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
In the 60s and in my case, the late 60s and 70s,

351
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
it was cool and certain aspects and wasn't so cool in others.

352
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
You had all these people fucked up on drugs

353
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and all the free love.

354
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Everybody's fucking everybody.

355
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And it's not really the best environment for a kid to grow up in.

356
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And it's cool as some of the things and a lot of the people were,

357
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
a lot of them were at least some of them.

358
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
We're just fucking lost.

359
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And yeah, all the kids were wild.

360
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
What do you expect?

361
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
I mean, we were just in imitating the grownups.

362
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So as a result, I was getting late

363
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
and doing all kinds of other crazy ship before I even reached puberty.

364
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
You basically had a lot of little kids just going off.

365
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
You got all these hippy kids with their hippy parents,

366
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
seeing all kinds of crazyness of adults running around naked.

367
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
People doing drugs, being insane.

368
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
That shit rubbs off on kids.

369
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Damn.

370
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Yeah.

371
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Did you completely think that was normal at the time?

372
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Was that just the way the world was?

373
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
That's the way my world was.

374
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I didn't realize really that we were so different from the world.

375
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000
I was different from the rest of society until my parents tried to put me into a regular school.

376
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And of course, I started getting fucked with a lot by the kids

377
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
because I had long hair and I didn't really fit in.

378
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And my parents looked like freaks.

379
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And that was when it really hit me.

380
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And it was also, I went from being at that hippy school

381
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
to being in a very strict school in Denmark,

382
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
which was like real old school and very rigid.

383
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
So it was total culture shock,

384
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
and it was like what the fuck?

385
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And so I started cutting school a lot and going back to the free school

386
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
to visit all my friends there and just hang out.

387
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And that's where you started playing?

388
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Pretty much.

389
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
You know, I mean, I was always in music.

390
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
That was really the first place that facilitated it.

391
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
You know, like they, that was one of the cool things about that school

392
00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
was they really pushed the arts.

393
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
You know, they, whatever the kids interests were,

394
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
they would give you the ability to pursue that.

395
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Unfortunately, they were also very lack.

396
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
So if like you didn't have the interest in pursuing math,

397
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
or whatever, they'd be like, oh, well, you know,

398
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
he's just not interested in it.

399
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
You know, he wants to be a musician.

400
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And it's like, you know, as we all know as parents

401
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
is like, no, fuck that, you need to know how to do your math.

402
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
You need to know your shit.

403
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
You need to have, you not use your brain.

404
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
You know, it's not just about, you know, gratifying your artistic

405
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
and creative interests because that's not going to always pay your fucking bills.

406
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Yeah.

407
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
So, no, but it was cool.

408
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
It was cool in certain ways, like I said, you know,

409
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
they, my math teacher, he was actually from the States.

410
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
He was from the Bronx.

411
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
And he was a jazz drummer and played stand-up bass.

412
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And he really was a big inspiration on me musically.

413
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
So, you know, it gave me some tools.

414
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
You know, that came in handy later in life.

415
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Yeah, for sure.

416
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
So, you were listening to, actually got your first gig then,

417
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
like, like, you were playing little Santana covers.

418
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Yeah.

419
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Cool in the gang covers.

420
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
That was my school band.

421
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Yeah, my school band was cool.

422
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
They were like, yeah, yeah, no, they were fucking legit.

423
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I mean, we were like, you know, funky stuff, you know,

424
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I mean, we were playing, like I said,

425
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
my math teacher, he was one of the band leaders.

426
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
So, you know, you got a guy from the Bronx who's a jazz dude.

427
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
He's going to be teaching all these little Danish kids musically.

428
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
What's really going on?

429
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Right.

430
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Because in Denmark at the time, things like, you know, Abba,

431
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Oh, his voice was big.

432
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
You know, so, you know, I mean, so it was like, what the fuck?

433
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
You know, so yeah, my school was cool as far as music and counter culture

434
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
and all that shit.

435
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
But then, you know, then, well, as you may have seen in the book,

436
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
really, then when my mother of all people turned me on to the sex pistols,

437
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
that's what really got that changed everything.

438
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
You know, that was an eye.

439
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Oh, yeah.

440
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Yeah.

441
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
The sex pistols.

442
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Oh, yeah.

443
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Yeah.

444
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
It changed everything for me.

445
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
And at that time, like, you got one section here where you said,

446
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I remember coming off stage, you were playing with the band.

447
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
I think the school band at this point, I remember coming off stage

448
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
one night, these girls.

449
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
No, yeah, yeah, but I was hanging out with, they were like, you know,

450
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
that lady you came with, which was her mom.

451
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
She's in the bathroom. She's not feeling too good.

452
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I went in the bathroom and my mom was throwing up all over the place.

453
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
That kind of shit was a kind of come down.

454
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Yeah.

455
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Back to reality.

456
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
That's the mom home.

457
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Yeah.

458
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Yeah.

459
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
It's fucked up, you know, little things like that.

460
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
They stay with you forever.

461
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
But, you know, to her,

462
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
she did sober up eventually.

463
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
And, you know, she's sobered up for about,

464
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
in the 80s, the day she died, she was cleaning.

465
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
You know,

466
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
yeah, you know, people fall victim to drugs to alcohol.

467
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
And sometimes it's hard to pull yourself out.

468
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
You know, but eventually she did, you know,

469
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
unfortunately I had to witness a lot of real,

470
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
ridiculous shit, but,

471
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
you know,

472
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I don't think there's such a thing as a perfect parent, you know.

473
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
No, no doubt about that.

474
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And your mom, she did, like you said,

475
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
she gets you this sex pistols out.

476
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Yeah.

477
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And like you said in here, you said,

478
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
well, that was that.

479
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Yeah.

480
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Yeah.

481
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
And it's almost,

482
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Kansas, what I was saying here we go,

483
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
go into your book here.

484
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Until that point,

485
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
I hung around with all these little hippie kids.

486
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
I had long ass hair,

487
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
so we were really already little freaks.

488
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
We'd walk around the streets.

489
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
People would give us looks and trip out on us.

490
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Our parents and teachers had long hair and beard and shit like that.

491
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
But then punk rock came about.

492
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
And this was more appropriate for me.

493
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
It wasn't all peace and love.

494
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
It was just more me.

495
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
The music was raw and the imagery and the craziness appealed to me.

496
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
It was energetic and a big factor for me was

497
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
you didn't have to aspire to be Jimmy Hendrix.

498
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
You didn't have to be Carlos Santana.

499
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
So you listen to that music and you'd say,

500
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
you know what?

501
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I can just play it.

502
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
I can do this.

503
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
You can play that.

504
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I can do this.

505
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I can have fun and do this shit.

506
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Like this is, you know,

507
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
you don't need to rack your brain to figure out how to do this.

508
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
You could just do it.

509
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
You know,

510
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
You're power of horror.

511
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Fuck it.

512
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Yeah, man.

513
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
You know, it's like,

514
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
you just need some serity, man.

515
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
That's all you need, man.

516
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
That's all you fucking need.

517
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
It was funny.

518
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I always tell people this about music.

519
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
If you go to a guitar store anywhere in America

520
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
and you put up a little flyer in there that says,

521
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
you know, I need someone that can play every note on the following three albums.

522
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
You know, and you pick a complex, you pick rush and cart and they're,

523
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
and they'll be, you'll get 10 people that'll say,

524
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
yeah, I can play all that stuff.

525
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
I'll play it for you right now.

526
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
But there's,

527
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
and all those guys, I mean, a lot of those guys,

528
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
unless they have that thing, unless they have that sincerity that you're talking about,

529
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
and they have that little spark of creativity.

530
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
It doesn't matter how technically you are,

531
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
if you don't have that heart.

532
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
You could be technically amazing and have not won

533
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
ounce of inspiration in your fucking body.

534
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
You know, and I mean, look, man,

535
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
you know, the Ramones were, you know,

536
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
some of the worst greatest musicians ever.

537
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
You know, those guys could barely fucking play

538
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
and they wrote some, they wrote songs that are still anthems.

539
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
You know, songs that you will still hear played at like major sports,

540
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
arenas or whatever.

541
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
I mean, you know, yeah, you know, music's a fucking weird thing, man.

542
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
That is, it is.

543
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
And you had your first band called Little Big Boss.

544
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Is that in reference to you?

545
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
I mean, you know what?

546
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Since you've been here a whole, you know,

547
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
it must have been because the other two guys in the band were adults,

548
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
and they named the band.

549
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
So looking back, they probably named it after me,

550
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
because I was like, I guess already,

551
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
a tyrant to play with, but you know,

552
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
and you were playing drums at that time?

553
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Yeah, yeah.

554
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Hammering all the drums.

555
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And then you guys move back to,

556
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
back to New York.

557
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Yeah, and you're going back and forth back to New York.

558
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Yeah, I mean, my mom, we lived in Europe,

559
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
but we would come back every year or year and a half or so

560
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
to see my grandparents and my aunts and stuff.

561
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And so we always had that connection to New York.

562
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
We always came back and I, you know,

563
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
and I was here during all, like, the pivotal moments in history in New York.

564
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Like, you know, I remember it's on a Sam,

565
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
which was huge if you were here.

566
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
You know, I remember the blackouts,

567
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
which were also huge if you hear,

568
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I remember the garbage strike,

569
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
which was also insane because you had like,

570
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
20 foot mountains of garbage every fucking way.

571
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
I mean, the city's stink.

572
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
I mean, you know, like,

573
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
I remember all the madness of New York.

574
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
I mean, I moved back here for good in 79,

575
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
like, I guess, January or February of 79.

576
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
It was like the weeks it died.

577
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Actually, the stimulators were supposed to play

578
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
maxes the one weekend that he was playing any died before the show.

579
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
But, um, yeah, you know,

580
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
it was a much different place back then, you know,

581
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
you guys know, you know,

582
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
but a, you know, a lot of people who have only been here over the last 20.

583
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Years, they have no clue.

584
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Yeah, no.

585
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
It is a different place.

586
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
And I mean, you know, in the book,

587
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
you got crazy pictures like you and Andy Warhol.

588
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Yeah.

589
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Because you were just your,

590
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
it was your aunt Denise that was running with that.

591
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Well, no, actually, he, that was just a random moment.

592
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
My mom actually knew him.

593
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
She had been in one of his movies when she was young,

594
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000
when she was like 15 or something.

595
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
And that picture was just taken at the class show.

596
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Like I used to run into people like him at different clubs and stuff.

597
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
This was backstage at a class gig first time they played.

598
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
You look like you're about 10.

599
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
I was actually 12 in that picture.

600
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
But yeah, I mean,

601
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
I was at all the clubs all the time.

602
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
You know, I mean, it was actually,

603
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
it was, you know, kind of weird.

604
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
You know, thinking back on it because like,

605
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
I mean, when I, when I did a video,

606
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
I did a thing with Anthony board day and a while back.

607
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
And he was like, you know, he, he's like,

608
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
I remember standing front of clubs like Max is and trying to get in.

609
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
And you know, here come this like 12 year old kid.

610
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Just like walk through the fucking door.

611
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Like the bounce was just like let him in.

612
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Like, you know, like he belonged in there and I'm like,

613
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
who the fuck?

614
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
And why the fuck is this child here?

615
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Like who let him in and who the fuck is he?

616
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
And why are they serving him?

617
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Like he's the fucking mayor.

618
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
You know, you know,

619
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
thinking back it is, yeah, it's fucking a little strange.

620
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
You know, I mean, I was, I was the youngest kid that you

621
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
around on the club scene back then.

622
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
And then, you know, as time went on,

623
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
you know, my band, the stimulator,

624
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
it was really, had a lot to do with it.

625
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
The crowds at the show started getting younger.

626
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
And younger because like, you know,

627
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
we started pulling a very young following,

628
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
you know, go figure 12 year old in the band.

629
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
And people like the Beastie Boys,

630
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
they started coming to see it before they were the Beastie Boys.

631
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
They were like, they were just fans of ours,

632
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
friends of mine.

633
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
They were like some of my best friends growing up.

634
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
And then a lot of other people who went on to

635
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
start a lot of the first wave of New York hardcore bands

636
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
were fans of the stimulators.

637
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Kids were all like, you know,

638
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
and they really teens when they used to see us play.

639
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
And then they went on to start a lot of the bands that

640
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
they had, you know, set off that.

641
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
How long did you play with the stimulator for?

642
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I had only played with them from like 79 to like 80.

643
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Maybe the beginning of 81.

644
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
And then I was done with it because at that point,

645
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
I had already, you know,

646
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
the bad brains had come to New York and I was already.

647
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
And I was, all that first hardcore that came out from,

648
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
you know, black flagged a circle jerks,

649
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
minor threat and of course bands like this charge

650
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
from over see from England, you know,

651
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000
and all that shit was starting to really take over my,

652
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
my, my soul.

653
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
And so I was like, you know,

654
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I can't play with the fucking stimulator anymore.

655
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
It should as to poppy.

656
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
It's to like, it's happy.

657
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
It's just not, it's not where I am.

658
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
And at that point, I had already, you know,

659
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
the life I was living on the streets and the wife that,

660
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
you know, the other band members were living was not really the same.

661
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
I was just hitting my teens.

662
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
And as we all know,

663
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
that's when the problem was became,

664
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
you know, that's when you start getting in trouble.

665
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
So yeah.

666
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
And the music that I started writing really reflected the,

667
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
the feelings that I was having.

668
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
You know, the, because of the,

669
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
not just the environment, but just, you know,

670
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
everything leading up to that point had,

671
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
had created this person.

672
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
And, and it was a really violent neighborhood.

673
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
You know, it was a really violent neighborhood.

674
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
And I ate a lot of shit for being white.

675
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
And, um, which is ironic because, you know,

676
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
I'm quarter Dominican and I'm Cherokee and I'm Chakhtow.

677
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
But if you look at me, especially, you know,

678
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
you know, all Puerto Rican neighborhood, I'm a white boy.

679
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
You know, so I really ate a lot of shit.

680
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
I really, you know, until I started fighting.

681
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
And actually, started getting more,

682
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
I hate to say it, but it started getting more violent.

683
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
That started to earn me a little bit of respect.

684
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
And, uh, I guess the fear and the credibility kind of went hand in hand,

685
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
like when people knew that they couldn't fuck with me.

686
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
I started getting respect.

687
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
And, um, I don't really think that's a really healthy,

688
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:19.000
for a young mind to associate popularity with violence and aggression.

689
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
You know.

690
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Yeah.

691
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
And I mean, New York at that time.

692
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
And like you said, and I used to come down to New York sometimes when I was younger.

693
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And it was completely different.

694
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
You know, in the mid 80s, on you were there earlier than that.

695
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
But for me, in the mid 80s, when you'd come down here,

696
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
it was completely different.

697
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
I mean, we're sitting here right now in Times Square.

698
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Times Square was fucking nuts around you.

699
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
It was not man.

700
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
There was like, you take two, every two steps.

701
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Somebody be off and you drugs.

702
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
You know, I used to come here when I'd cut school and just watch people get pickpocketed.

703
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Watch the hookers, turn in tricks and the guy is selling drugs and the people getting into trouble.

704
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Yeah.

705
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
It was, it was a fucking free for all of us.

706
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Really?

707
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
And where you were living, you were living.

708
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Yeah, it was just dangerous.

709
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000
It was dangerous.

710
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
It was way worse.

711
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
I mean, I was talking to, Iced, the other day we were talking about.

712
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
You know, some of our experiences and just in my area alone, I mean,

713
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
there was about five or six gangs within a, you know, ten,

714
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
fifteen block.

715
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Distance, you know, everything from the hitmen on my block were,

716
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
were fucking really out of control to the Hell's Angels on third street,

717
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
who back then were legitimately no fucking joke.

718
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
I mean, you know, I mean, I could tell you some fucked up.

719
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Stories, but you know, you can tell me fucked up stories.

720
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000
So it's just, it's hard to, you know, it's hard to, if people go to New York now,

721
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
it's just completely different.

722
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Yeah, it really is.

723
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
It's, it's impossible to really get it.

724
00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000
I mean, the best thing you could do is look at like some old movies that kind of try to capture the,

725
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
then you got some pictures in the book that show the neighborhoods.

726
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Yeah.

727
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
And there, you can tell, you can tell they look like a war zone.

728
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Yeah.

729
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
I mean, I wouldn't know, but they look as close to one of the things.

730
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
They look like a war zone.

731
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
You can take it from me or that one.

732
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
I mean, I mean, dude, I was living in a squat.

733
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
We literally had no running water, no windows, no doors.

734
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
What's the, how old were you when you like moved out?

735
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
I was like, I was told when I was like 14, you know,

736
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
because basically I was getting into so much trouble in school that they were about to,

737
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
basically take me from my mother and put me in like spotford.

738
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
And I was like, fuck this.

739
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
You know, I had lost interest in school and all that shit.

740
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
It's actually funny.

741
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
I was something I wanted to tell you.

742
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
When I was 15, actually just right down there,

743
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
there was a recruiting center of Army Marines, Navy the whole bit.

744
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
And I was 15.

745
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
I tried to enlist in the Marines, you know, because like at that point,

746
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
I was already, I was very, I guess I had a lot of pent-up aggression.

747
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
You know, and I was just like, you know, I just want to fucking, you know,

748
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
I probably shouldn't say this and probably sounds bad for the military,

749
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
but I just wanted to kill.

750
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
I just wanted to fucking kill and I wanted to be able to, like,

751
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
I just was so fucking, you know,

752
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
and it didn't help that my mother was a hippie.

753
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
So, you know, just it's natural for a teenager to rebel against everything their parents believe in.

754
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
I mean, I had like fucking recruiting, you know, catalogs and shit under my bed,

755
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
whereas most kids probably had, you know, their playboys and shit, like my mom would find my

756
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
rugby, I don't know, their recruiting shit, like what is this?

757
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
You know, instead of like holding up the fucking, you know, pent-ups,

758
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
what did he do?

759
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
He's like, I had him raised by a son to beat no soldier.

760
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Get out of fucking hippie fucking.

761
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
There's a lot of guys in the military.

762
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
You know, I like fuck this.

763
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Through the years, you're a hundred percent right, because through the years,

764
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
there's so many guys in the military and you meet some guy and you're like, hey,

765
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
how's it going?

766
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
You know, you learn their last name at first, but then you know,

767
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
you get to know him a little bit and you're like, you know,

768
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
what's your first name?

769
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
And they'll be like, oh, my first name is Rainbow.

770
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
You know, my first name is, you know, Ocean.

771
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
And then they go, yeah, my parents were happy, you know.

772
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
And so many kids rebel against the hippie parents.

773
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
I'm going to be a horrible man.

774
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I'm going to the in the sea with these.

775
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
That's very common.

776
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
So you're a hundred percent right.

777
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
It's a good way to rebel.

778
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
And I even say this, you know, for me, you know,

779
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
hardcore was a rebellion.

780
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
No, yeah.

781
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
And going in the military for it was a rebellion against the the norm.

782
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
You know, was everyone's going to a,

783
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
go be a hippie, smoked dope, go to college, get a job.

784
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
And I was like, no, I'm going to go be a commando and just get after it.

785
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Fuck you know.

786
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Yeah, dude.

787
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
So you know what, it's fucked up because it's like,

788
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
had I followed those instincts, you know.

789
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
I mean, you know, and some ways my life would have been probably a million times better.

790
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
I know what it had a lot more, you know,

791
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
discipline.

792
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
I would have had a lot more focus.

793
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
I would have had more positive of a ship, you know, going on.

794
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
I would have learned some of skills in shit, but at the same time,

795
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
I wouldn't have fucking written age of quarrel.

796
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
I wouldn't have written best wishes.

797
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
I wouldn't have influenced people like you to be, you know,

798
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
to go above and beyond what the fuck I could ever fucking try to do.

799
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
You know, so it's like I feel like in my own way,

800
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
I managed to do my service to, you know, humanity.

801
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
If you will, you know, although it was a disservice in a lot of ways

802
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
because I did inspire a lot of people to do a lot of really fucking wrong shit, you know.

803
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
But, but nonetheless, the inspiration that it was real, it was genuine.

804
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
I think that's why I 30 years later, people still give a fuck about that record.

805
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
And people still out making money on that record.

806
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
And, you know, people still cover songs off that record.

807
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
You know, and it's funny because I was telling you earlier.

808
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
I mean, that line-up that played on that record.

809
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Only lasted for one fucking record.

810
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
You know, it's amazing how short-term it's a lot.

811
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Yeah, sure.

812
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Yeah.

813
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
And it's like, and you know, it was something special because still now,

814
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
30 years later, people still talking about it.

815
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
And not many people can say that based on one fucking album.

816
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Yeah.

817
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
You know, so, that's good shit.

818
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
I got it.

819
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
I'm just going to go like, I'm talking about your neighborhood.

820
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:33.000
This is just kind of a sample of what you were living around and in.

821
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Back to the book.

822
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
I remember one night lying there hearing some check down the street getting raped.

823
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
And knowing there was really nothing to do.

824
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
It was like a helpless feeling.

825
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
You knew that if the cops got called, it wouldn't matter because they probably wouldn't show up.

826
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
And if they did, it would be too late and they probably wouldn't find her.

827
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Yeah.

828
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
One night, my mother's then boyfriend got the tip of his nose almost shot off by a zip gun.

829
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
He has a scar to this day.

830
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Just because he was white, looked a little freaky and was walking down our block.

831
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
I remember coming home one night in my aunt.

832
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
And my aunt, my aunt and and Gustafson, the stimulators base,

833
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
has jumped by six dudes with golf clubs and shit trying to pull her guitar out of her hands.

834
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
You don't really think about a group of guys jumping two chicks in a kid,

835
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
but that shit happened.

836
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
They didn't give a fuck.

837
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
You've got to figure a lot of these guys would hang out and huff glue and shit.

838
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000
And when you huff glue and you smoke a lot of dust, you get pretty grim and lean towards the violence.

839
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Yeah.

840
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
So there's your surroundings, there's your environment.

841
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Yeah.

842
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.000
I mean, it's, you know, it's, I'll tell you, man, it's, it's, uh,

843
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
it's almost harder to hear it being read back to me now,

844
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
especially in your voice, but, but it's like, you know, it's real.

845
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000
And it, it brings back a, a serious emotional response at me, you know.

846
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
You know, as I was reading that, I was just thinking of myself because you and I, you know, in the scene,

847
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
there was always guys that had dogs, right in pit bulls, everyone had pit bulls.

848
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And as I was reading that, you know, you and I both know, if you take a pit bull,

849
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
and you bring it up and you beat it and you torture it and you heard it,

850
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
that dog's going to be a mean evil bastard.

851
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And if that dog's brother can get brought up and get fed and get taken care of and, you know,

852
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
sleep and get treated good and that dog's and grow up, I mean, I said, you know,

853
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:48.000
I just think and you take a person, a human being and you put them in an environment where that's what they're living with and that's what they're seeing and that's what's around them.

854
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
They're going to tend towards that direction.

855
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Yeah. And it's going to be hard to break out of that shit.

856
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
It is, you know, and it's, you know, look around at the world, man.

857
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:05.000
You know, look at all the, all the fucking getos everywhere. Look at all the, you know, all the, you know,

858
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
a lot of people don't get outside of this country, you know, they live here.

859
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:18.000
So if people don't realize how well they have it, you know, and even, you know, I used to laugh.

860
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.000
I was talking to my friend, Meli Mel and we were saying, I was saying, you know, I don't even understand what the fuck's up with all that,

861
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000
like Wes Kowe's gang banging shit. I mean, these guys, they, first of all, they don't even have to deal with winter.

862
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:41.000
They, you know, second fall. They all got like yards and garages and fucking barbecues and shit.

863
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Like we grew up in like apartments with fucking rats and roaches and, you know, concrete everywhere.

864
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Yeah. And, you know, what the fuck you so pissed about that you need to go and shoot at each other and kill each other. You have fucking bored.

865
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Like it's just, you know, it is an interesting dynamic here in New York City, the way it is.

866
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Yeah, it's very, it's, it's, I mean, even now that it's like, you know, soft as fucking baby shit, it's still in touch.

867
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Yeah, you know, I like, I, I just, I feel confined when I'm here, you know, now, now that I've grown up when I come here,

868
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
I living cow, I live a cow for you. Yeah. And you're right. I got a yards.

869
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:34.000
And I got a barbecues. And, and my neighbors have yards. And they say good morning.

870
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Yeah, you know, it's going up. And it's, it's like you just, you have space, yeah.

871
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Yeah, it's a real thing. And animals, you know, you can't put animal in little tiny cage. They get pissed off.

872
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Yeah. That's what we do with 8 million people in New York put him in little tiny cages, but it's hard getting pissed off.

873
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
It's tough.

874
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Especially when the good majority of them are broke a shit.

875
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.72
But this whole time, as you're doing this, at the same time, you're still listening

876
00:41:01.72 --> 00:41:04.96
to music, you're going to show us all the time.

877
00:41:04.96 --> 00:41:07.72
Like you said, the bad brain show up.

878
00:41:07.72 --> 00:41:08.72
Yeah.

879
00:41:08.72 --> 00:41:09.72
That was a change.

880
00:41:09.72 --> 00:41:10.72
That was a game changer.

881
00:41:10.72 --> 00:41:15.64
They were as groundbreaking as far as for me.

882
00:41:15.64 --> 00:41:18.84
They rocked in my world as much as the sex pistols.

883
00:41:18.84 --> 00:41:21.24
Like it was like all of a sudden it was a new chapter.

884
00:41:21.24 --> 00:41:24.04
I, you know, the way you wrote about the bad brain.

885
00:41:24.04 --> 00:41:29.56
So the bad brains for those of you that don't know is a band from DC and they were pivotal

886
00:41:29.56 --> 00:41:33.04
in changing music, really, generation of music.

887
00:41:33.04 --> 00:41:36.64
And there's all kinds of bands that reference them, like big bands that reference the

888
00:41:36.64 --> 00:41:37.64
bad brains.

889
00:41:37.64 --> 00:41:38.64
But here's what you said about the bad brains.

890
00:41:38.64 --> 00:41:39.64
That's one thing.

891
00:41:39.64 --> 00:41:40.64
Yeah.

892
00:41:40.64 --> 00:41:45.56
But this is for those who don't know, they were not only one of the innovators of

893
00:41:45.56 --> 00:41:49.60
what we call hardcore punk, but they were all black.

894
00:41:49.60 --> 00:41:51.32
And they were from DC.

895
00:41:51.32 --> 00:41:55.72
And you know, there was not many black kids on the scene.

896
00:41:55.72 --> 00:41:57.36
There always was black kids on the scene.

897
00:41:57.36 --> 00:41:58.36
There was always Puerto Rican.

898
00:41:58.36 --> 00:41:59.36
It was always everybody.

899
00:41:59.36 --> 00:42:02.08
You know, we always, it was always mixed diversity on the scene.

900
00:42:02.08 --> 00:42:05.48
But they were like the best.

901
00:42:05.48 --> 00:42:06.48
They were the tightest.

902
00:42:06.48 --> 00:42:07.48
They were the best.

903
00:42:07.48 --> 00:42:10.56
They were the fucking, they were the shit man.

904
00:42:10.56 --> 00:42:14.96
And a lot of times when people first heard their first 45, you know, just because of the

905
00:42:14.96 --> 00:42:18.16
style of the music, people didn't even know they were black.

906
00:42:18.16 --> 00:42:19.16
And they'd go see them.

907
00:42:19.16 --> 00:42:20.44
They'd be like, oh shit, these guys are black.

908
00:42:20.44 --> 00:42:22.44
Now that may not seem like a big deal now.

909
00:42:22.44 --> 00:42:26.40
But we're talking about fucking, you know, 80.

910
00:42:26.40 --> 00:42:29.72
You know, and yeah, they were just the fucking, they were the shit man.

911
00:42:29.72 --> 00:42:31.36
And then they got into rostophionism.

912
00:42:31.36 --> 00:42:34.16
And that, you know, even further made it even more bizarre.

913
00:42:34.16 --> 00:42:37.52
A bunch of fucking rostos from DC playing hardcore.

914
00:42:37.52 --> 00:42:39.52
Yeah, you know, with the fuckers dad.

915
00:42:39.52 --> 00:42:43.40
And playing it better than everybody, like fucking smoking motherfucking.

916
00:42:43.40 --> 00:42:44.40
Yeah.

917
00:42:44.40 --> 00:42:50.28
You know, you know, I think if you got to see the bad brands back in the day, you're

918
00:42:50.28 --> 00:42:51.28
lucky.

919
00:42:51.28 --> 00:42:55.32
And I mean, I remember seeing the bad brands and just being.

920
00:42:55.32 --> 00:43:00.20
You just, just, I mean, it'd be like seeing James Brown back when he had Bootsie Collins

921
00:43:00.20 --> 00:43:04.20
on base, like back in the old, like when he was like all over the, I always used to like

922
00:43:04.20 --> 00:43:07.16
in HR to like James Brown meets Johnny Rotten.

923
00:43:07.16 --> 00:43:08.16
Yeah.

924
00:43:08.16 --> 00:43:09.60
You know, here's what you said.

925
00:43:09.60 --> 00:43:11.000
Back to the book.

926
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.40
You hear a lot of crazy stories about HR. HR is the, the singer from the bad brands.

927
00:43:16.40 --> 00:43:19.32
Throat in the bad brands.

928
00:43:19.32 --> 00:43:25.56
But as crazy as HR can act at times back in the day, he was inspirational beyond belief.

929
00:43:25.56 --> 00:43:30.36
He and the bad brands had the entire New Yorkard, your see, hardcore scene talking like

930
00:43:30.36 --> 00:43:33.08
fucking Jamaicans for the longest time.

931
00:43:33.08 --> 00:43:35.08
Everybody was like fire, bro, and blood clot.

932
00:43:35.08 --> 00:43:36.32
There's a stericle.

933
00:43:36.32 --> 00:43:37.32
There you go.

934
00:43:37.32 --> 00:43:41.28
The mob were so heavily influenced by them that the base players started growing dreads

935
00:43:41.28 --> 00:43:43.12
and wearing a roster hat.

936
00:43:43.12 --> 00:43:47.000
A whole contingent of white roster started popping up on the hardcore scene.

937
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.48
They took things to another level.

938
00:43:49.48 --> 00:43:51.96
It was impossible not to be inspired by the bad brands.

939
00:43:51.96 --> 00:43:57.24
The only way to describe HR would be like James Brown meets Johnny Rotten meets Bob Marley.

940
00:43:57.24 --> 00:43:59.24
He was such a dynamic front man.

941
00:43:59.24 --> 00:44:04.04
HR could do a standing back flip and land right at the end of the song, nail it right

942
00:44:04.04 --> 00:44:05.56
at the last beat.

943
00:44:05.56 --> 00:44:08.24
It was like, oh my god, did he just plan that?

944
00:44:08.24 --> 00:44:11.96
I remember one time at A7, which was a tiny club.

945
00:44:11.96 --> 00:44:15.64
Within the first two minutes or so of their show, he had already knocked the sheet rock ceiling

946
00:44:15.64 --> 00:44:18.04
out and bent the Mike stand in half.

947
00:44:18.04 --> 00:44:21.48
The amount of explosive energy that would come out of that mother fucker, you couldn't

948
00:44:21.48 --> 00:44:23.16
help, it would be blown away.

949
00:44:23.16 --> 00:44:27.04
Especially since we were all young and here was this guy that was in shape.

950
00:44:27.04 --> 00:44:29.64
He used to be a javlin thrower back in high school.

951
00:44:29.64 --> 00:44:30.64
He was always athletic.

952
00:44:30.64 --> 00:44:34.36
So he had a bunch of scrawny punk rock mother fuckers and then this dude's up there.

953
00:44:34.36 --> 00:44:39.72
That was an athletic powerhouse going completely apeshit and he could sing his ass off and

954
00:44:39.72 --> 00:44:40.72
he could hit notes.

955
00:44:40.72 --> 00:44:44.32
HR came out there with a purpose like he was on a mission.

956
00:44:44.32 --> 00:44:46.92
Every show I saw there is back then was amazing.

957
00:44:46.92 --> 00:44:54.20
I remember I saw him up in Boston one time and he was like going, I guess fire pipes

958
00:44:54.20 --> 00:44:59.28
or whatever sprinkler pipes and he's leaping up and swinging on those things and jumping

959
00:44:59.28 --> 00:45:00.60
off into crowd.

960
00:45:00.60 --> 00:45:01.60
It was nuts.

961
00:45:01.60 --> 00:45:02.60
He was a must.

962
00:45:02.60 --> 00:45:05.96
He's also man, he spent half the show in the crowd.

963
00:45:05.96 --> 00:45:17.72
He was, yeah, you know, you can't, you can't, you can't even, you know, yeah, man, they

964
00:45:17.72 --> 00:45:20.28
was something.

965
00:45:20.28 --> 00:45:25.04
Everybody has that moment though that period where they really, you know, will not

966
00:45:25.04 --> 00:45:29.96
everybody, but everybody who's like intense, you know, you think about your life, you

967
00:45:29.96 --> 00:45:35.04
can think of that one period where you were just on fucking point, you know, and they

968
00:45:35.04 --> 00:45:37.88
were like 16 at a ended like last week.

969
00:45:37.88 --> 00:45:44.52
You know, I would have been laughing.

970
00:45:44.52 --> 00:45:45.52
I would have been laughing.

971
00:45:45.52 --> 00:45:51.72
That's some of us, but yeah, there was a period when they were just fucking untouchable.

972
00:45:51.72 --> 00:45:56.32
And you know, if you've seen HR now, yeah, I've seen him over the few actually.

973
00:45:56.32 --> 00:46:01.48
Like, seen him talk to him.

974
00:46:01.48 --> 00:46:06.48
I, last time I spoke to him and he came out to my house was probably around 2011 or 2010.

975
00:46:06.48 --> 00:46:11.44
And, you know, he's definitely, you know, he's got some issues.

976
00:46:11.44 --> 00:46:13.72
He had suffered some serious.

977
00:46:13.72 --> 00:46:19.44
He has like mental issues, you know, I mean, I don't know what his diagnosis is.

978
00:46:19.44 --> 00:46:23.76
I'm not going to stay in here and pretend to know, but it's, you know, but you can tell

979
00:46:23.76 --> 00:46:25.76
there's a clear change.

980
00:46:25.76 --> 00:46:30.68
But yeah, that guy from that guy, yeah, that guy now, there's something that's definitely

981
00:46:30.68 --> 00:46:34.84
clear as something a psychological difference, you know, and I, you can't just blame

982
00:46:34.84 --> 00:46:40.000
it all on drugs because, you know, some of us have done plenty of them and are fine.

983
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.64
So I mean, there's, there's something that's, yeah.

984
00:46:43.64 --> 00:46:44.64
You know, and it's really sad.

985
00:46:44.64 --> 00:46:45.64
It's really sad.

986
00:46:45.64 --> 00:46:46.64
You know, they're playing.

987
00:46:46.64 --> 00:46:50.08
Well, you know, I don't, I don't know, I don't know when or what they're doing and

988
00:46:50.08 --> 00:46:51.08
playing.

989
00:46:51.08 --> 00:46:54.72
I mean, and God bless them, you know, I mean, Dr. Noah, you know, he suffered a stroke and

990
00:46:54.72 --> 00:46:58.000
a heart attack and he had to like learn how to use his hand again.

991
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.52
And I, and everything, I actually did a benefit show us a record that's available on

992
00:47:03.52 --> 00:47:05.52
the pledge music.

993
00:47:05.52 --> 00:47:06.52
It's the only place you can get.

994
00:47:06.52 --> 00:47:11.84
You can't even buy it in stores and 48% of the music goes to help him just help him.

995
00:47:11.84 --> 00:47:15.92
Also, you know, to whatever he needs help with, you know, because God knows he's pledged

996
00:47:15.92 --> 00:47:16.92
music.

997
00:47:16.92 --> 00:47:21.40
Yeah, you just search pledged pledge music, Harley Flanagan, and the song will come up.

998
00:47:21.40 --> 00:47:26.20
It's one of the songs is called Friends Like You.

999
00:47:26.20 --> 00:47:28.40
But anyway, yeah, I mean, those guys were intense.

1000
00:47:28.40 --> 00:47:33.88
I mean, it'll never be what it was, you know, I'm glad that they're doing their thing

1001
00:47:33.88 --> 00:47:34.88
or, you know, whatnot.

1002
00:47:34.88 --> 00:47:39.72
But I think my memory of them is from that period.

1003
00:47:39.72 --> 00:47:40.72
Yeah.

1004
00:47:40.72 --> 00:47:43.72
And he, he probably saw how many times did you see him?

1005
00:47:43.72 --> 00:47:44.72
I don't know.

1006
00:47:44.72 --> 00:47:45.72
I've got some.

1007
00:47:45.72 --> 00:47:46.72
I have no idea.

1008
00:47:46.72 --> 00:47:47.72
I saw them so many times.

1009
00:47:47.72 --> 00:47:51.36
I saw them out on the west coast and, you know, excuse me.

1010
00:47:51.36 --> 00:47:54.36
Yeah, I saw them in Tijuana.

1011
00:47:54.36 --> 00:47:55.36
Oh, yeah.

1012
00:47:55.36 --> 00:47:58.36
But HR wasn't where the, so it was kind of like, yeah.

1013
00:47:58.36 --> 00:47:59.36
But not that's cool.

1014
00:47:59.36 --> 00:48:00.36
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1015
00:48:00.36 --> 00:48:02.36
I was the singers who were really good.

1016
00:48:02.36 --> 00:48:05.36
Great dudes, great singers, but it's really hard to follow.

1017
00:48:05.36 --> 00:48:08.36
And someone like, yeah, footsteps, I mean, that's a rough follow.

1018
00:48:08.36 --> 00:48:09.36
That's a rough follow.

1019
00:48:09.36 --> 00:48:10.36
Yeah, sure.

1020
00:48:10.36 --> 00:48:16.36
So meanwhile, you did a trip to England.

1021
00:48:16.36 --> 00:48:19.36
This is the first time you saw skinheads before.

1022
00:48:19.36 --> 00:48:21.36
Well, I saw some skinheads.

1023
00:48:21.36 --> 00:48:23.36
I got my head shaved in Ireland.

1024
00:48:23.36 --> 00:48:28.36
I had seen skinheads one time before in London, but I didn't know what the fuck they were.

1025
00:48:28.36 --> 00:48:29.36
I was just like, what the fuck?

1026
00:48:29.36 --> 00:48:34.36
I like I can tell that there was something they had an interesting look like they, you know,

1027
00:48:34.36 --> 00:48:36.36
but the shaved head thing was what got me.

1028
00:48:36.36 --> 00:48:42.36
And yeah, so I met skinheads in England in the 70s, but I got my head shaved in

1029
00:48:42.36 --> 00:48:44.36
Belfast in 1980.

1030
00:48:44.36 --> 00:48:45.36
And here's what they told you.

1031
00:48:45.36 --> 00:48:46.36
Going back to the book.

1032
00:48:46.36 --> 00:48:49.36
I always remembered what the Belfast skins told me.

1033
00:48:49.36 --> 00:48:51.36
Teach America about skinheads.

1034
00:48:51.36 --> 00:48:56.36
The first few friends of mine to shave their heads included Adam Yach.

1035
00:48:56.36 --> 00:48:57.36
We know that.

1036
00:48:57.36 --> 00:48:58.36
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1037
00:48:58.36 --> 00:48:59.36
From the Beastie Boys.

1038
00:48:59.36 --> 00:49:02.36
And a few others who weren't really skinheads in the stereotypical fuck way.

1039
00:49:02.36 --> 00:49:04.36
They just like the look in the music.

1040
00:49:04.36 --> 00:49:08.36
I mean, we were all into the early, always style music.

1041
00:49:08.36 --> 00:49:12.36
Cockney rejects and bands like that, even though it wasn't really called Oya.

1042
00:49:12.36 --> 00:49:17.36
The two-tone thing was happening with all the scob bands jumping off like the specials

1043
00:49:17.36 --> 00:49:19.36
and selector and madness.

1044
00:49:19.36 --> 00:49:22.36
And they were all popular with the skinheads early on.

1045
00:49:22.36 --> 00:49:28.36
But there still wasn't a skinhead scene in New York just a few friends of mine who were up on it.

1046
00:49:28.36 --> 00:49:30.36
We were going a couple of years all that would change.

1047
00:49:30.36 --> 00:49:38.36
So obviously the typical person that doesn't follow the music scene, at least at a deeper level,

1048
00:49:38.36 --> 00:49:46.36
when they think skinhead, they immediately think of sort of the branch that went off and got the most press,

1049
00:49:46.36 --> 00:49:49.36
which was the neonazi skinheads.

1050
00:49:49.36 --> 00:50:04.36
But the original, the origins of the skinheads is actually black dudes, rude boys, scob bands, like the specials and madness.

1051
00:50:04.36 --> 00:50:08.36
And that's kind of what you saw.

1052
00:50:08.36 --> 00:50:12.36
Yeah, I mean, I actually talk about a little bit of that in the book.

1053
00:50:12.36 --> 00:50:19.36
I give a little bit of the historical information, just to give people a clearer idea.

1054
00:50:19.36 --> 00:50:26.36
Yeah, but you know, the media always latches onto whatever is most sensationalistic.

1055
00:50:26.36 --> 00:50:32.36
They try to always grab the worst aspects of what people are doing.

1056
00:50:32.36 --> 00:50:38.36
And you know, yeah, you know, that you got it, you know.

1057
00:50:38.36 --> 00:50:39.36
Yeah, yeah.

1058
00:50:39.36 --> 00:50:47.36
I mean, I'll say one more thing, the New York scene had always been more diverse than most hardcore scenes that always been Spanish kids, black kids, Asian kids.

1059
00:50:47.36 --> 00:50:51.36
A lot of the early New York hardcore skinheads were Spanish.

1060
00:50:51.36 --> 00:50:52.36
Yeah.

1061
00:50:52.36 --> 00:50:58.36
Majer from Agnostic Front, which if you don't know, Agnostic Front is probably, they might be considered like the,

1062
00:50:58.36 --> 00:51:02.36
oh, they're definitely one of the biggest sort of skin head bands from America.

1063
00:51:02.36 --> 00:51:06.36
And they were absolutely the first real like New York skin head.

1064
00:51:06.36 --> 00:51:10.36
Yeah, you know, I mean, but yeah, you know, and he's Cuban, he's Cuban.

1065
00:51:10.36 --> 00:51:14.36
Diego was Puerto Rican as was Jose from the mob.

1066
00:51:14.36 --> 00:51:23.36
And so a lot of skinheads that came around later, even back in the Max's days, you had the bad brains pure how the influence of one of the first real New York hardcore bands.

1067
00:51:23.36 --> 00:51:28.36
Yeah, I think where you just pulled up, I was just talking about the diversity on the scene in New York.

1068
00:51:28.36 --> 00:51:37.36
New York has always been different from other places, you know, you, you know, that's one of the things that's cool about it here.

1069
00:51:37.36 --> 00:51:38.36
Yeah.

1070
00:51:38.36 --> 00:51:42.36
I could say you could say it's fairly diverse here in New York City.

1071
00:51:42.36 --> 00:51:43.36
Fuck.

1072
00:51:43.36 --> 00:51:51.36
You know, this is Gabby, one of the most, I bet you, I don't know, you have to look at this, but is New York City one of the most diverse places on the planet?

1073
00:51:51.36 --> 00:51:54.36
It's far as like different languages that are spoken.

1074
00:51:54.36 --> 00:52:02.36
I mean, one thing I noticed that, you know, you can eat any type of food here, you know, so it's hooked by a people that it's connected.

1075
00:52:02.36 --> 00:52:06.36
Yeah, it's a big, so I mean, we had that moved here like three weeks ago.

1076
00:52:06.36 --> 00:52:08.36
That's one thing I always loved about it here, you know.

1077
00:52:08.36 --> 00:52:12.36
We just had gangmem style, uh, don't bling.

1078
00:52:12.36 --> 00:52:14.36
Yeah, don't bling and sushi.

1079
00:52:14.36 --> 00:52:17.36
Surred by by gangmem style.

1080
00:52:17.36 --> 00:52:22.36
Oh, oh.

1081
00:52:22.36 --> 00:52:32.36
And meanwhile, you know, at this time, back to the book, I was drinking a lot, huffing glue, taking pills and lots of LSD and whatever else.

1082
00:52:32.36 --> 00:52:37.36
So this whole time, that's what's just prevalent in the same year.

1083
00:52:37.36 --> 00:52:45.36
Yeah, New York was a very much, um, our scene liked to get fucked up.

1084
00:52:45.36 --> 00:52:53.36
In DC, they were they invented straight edge, you know, they were there all about being clean and sober and and God bless them.

1085
00:52:53.36 --> 00:53:01.36
And, you know, that caught on like wildfire in other places, you know, the straight edge movement spread and whatnot.

1086
00:53:01.36 --> 00:53:04.36
And we always went the extreme opposite.

1087
00:53:04.36 --> 00:53:09.36
We were like, you know, they had a song, don't drink, don't smoke, don't fuck.

1088
00:53:09.36 --> 00:53:14.36
We used to sing, you know, we drink, we smoke, we fuck you.

1089
00:53:14.36 --> 00:53:18.36
You know, and, um, yeah, we're a bunch of fucking idiots.

1090
00:53:18.36 --> 00:53:27.36
You know, I mean, you know, unfortunately, you know, at that point in my life.

1091
00:53:27.36 --> 00:53:31.36
And in the hardcore scene, uh,

1092
00:53:31.36 --> 00:53:36.36
who's often cool how fucked up you could be.

1093
00:53:36.36 --> 00:53:37.36
Yeah.

1094
00:53:37.36 --> 00:53:48.36
And I'm sure it's that way in a lot of the world and a lot of youth culture and a lot of, you know, crews and gang culture and you know, I don't mean to theorize.

1095
00:53:48.36 --> 00:53:51.36
But I'm going to do it a little bit of a last five.

1096
00:53:51.36 --> 00:53:56.36
You know, like, cultures back in the day or some cultures, even today,

1097
00:53:56.36 --> 00:54:05.36
when you want to prove that you are will sacrifice yourself for the tribe a little bit, like, I'll go hunt that lion or I'll go out and do something that's hard.

1098
00:54:05.36 --> 00:54:10.36
And that's hard. And I'll take risks for the group. And I'll prove that that I don't care what happens to me.

1099
00:54:10.36 --> 00:54:11.36
Yeah.

1100
00:54:11.36 --> 00:54:13.36
I should have been in the place.

1101
00:54:13.36 --> 00:54:16.36
Some places I think that, hey, I'm going to prove that I don't care what's happened to me.

1102
00:54:16.36 --> 00:54:20.36
Watch me drink this, watch me shoot this, watch me smoke this and whatever.

1103
00:54:20.36 --> 00:54:21.36
No, I agree.

1104
00:54:21.36 --> 00:54:28.36
I think that that instinct that still in us doesn't have a place to be used properly.

1105
00:54:28.36 --> 00:54:32.36
And I'll tell you where I got that philosophy from in the Seal teams.

1106
00:54:32.36 --> 00:54:41.36
Man, when I came in, it was like the way that you kind of proved that you were tough was drinking and fighting.

1107
00:54:41.36 --> 00:54:44.36
Yeah, drinking and fighting, everything to a fucking extreme.

1108
00:54:44.36 --> 00:54:46.36
If you fucking drink five, I'll drink 10.

1109
00:54:46.36 --> 00:54:47.36
Yeah.

1110
00:54:47.36 --> 00:54:49.36
You fought two motherfuckers off, fight fucking five motherfuckers.

1111
00:54:49.36 --> 00:54:51.36
And that's what it was.

1112
00:54:51.36 --> 00:54:56.36
And when the war started, it did not like that stopped because that stuff still goes on.

1113
00:54:56.36 --> 00:54:59.36
But it definitely in my mind, it in my mind, I was thinking,

1114
00:54:59.36 --> 00:55:02.36
and we still drank, I was still party, I didn't got after it.

1115
00:55:02.36 --> 00:55:05.36
But it was different, man.

1116
00:55:05.36 --> 00:55:09.36
It was different to all the sudden be saying, hey, look, you know what I need to prove myself is on the battlefield.

1117
00:55:09.36 --> 00:55:10.36
I need to be ready for that.

1118
00:55:10.36 --> 00:55:17.36
And so when I apply that to like all of society, it seems like a young kid like you,

1119
00:55:17.36 --> 00:55:21.36
who's 15, 16 years old, how do you prove that you're tough?

1120
00:55:21.36 --> 00:55:22.36
How do you prove your manhood?

1121
00:55:22.36 --> 00:55:26.36
Oh, you think you can drink 12 shots, I'll drink 20.

1122
00:55:26.36 --> 00:55:27.36
Bring it.

1123
00:55:27.36 --> 00:55:28.36
Yeah.

1124
00:55:28.36 --> 00:55:32.36
And you know, you talked about like the straight edge movement and those guys, it's interesting.

1125
00:55:32.36 --> 00:55:36.36
Well, they took it to a level 2, they stopped fucking.

1126
00:55:36.36 --> 00:55:37.36
They even did, they stopped.

1127
00:55:37.36 --> 00:55:39.36
And again, smoking that fucking.

1128
00:55:39.36 --> 00:55:42.36
And then how did they prove how did they did then prove that they were tough?

1129
00:55:42.36 --> 00:55:45.36
They would go out and fight and beat up people that were drunk and shit like that.

1130
00:55:45.36 --> 00:55:47.36
Well, that's how we started happening in some scenes.

1131
00:55:47.36 --> 00:55:48.36
Yeah.

1132
00:55:48.36 --> 00:55:53.36
Because like in DC, those guys were always, they always tried to be more PC.

1133
00:55:53.36 --> 00:55:55.36
They always had a little bit more consciousness.

1134
00:55:55.36 --> 00:56:01.36
But in a lot of other places, you had bands like you know, you got, I got in trouble with Ian McKay.

1135
00:56:01.36 --> 00:56:03.36
Adam.

1136
00:56:03.36 --> 00:56:06.36
Remember when Fugazi came on this day?

1137
00:56:06.36 --> 00:56:09.36
So Fugazi, one of my buddies from DC, this is back in the day.

1138
00:56:09.36 --> 00:56:13.36
And one of those guys, one of my buddies from DC.

1139
00:56:13.36 --> 00:56:15.36
They sent me a demo tape.

1140
00:56:15.36 --> 00:56:18.36
And he said, hey, this is Ian's new band.

1141
00:56:18.36 --> 00:56:19.36
And you're a guy.

1142
00:56:19.36 --> 00:56:20.36
No, I was like cool.

1143
00:56:20.36 --> 00:56:21.36
I had to grade out.

1144
00:56:21.36 --> 00:56:23.36
No, I was like, yeah, I was great.

1145
00:56:23.36 --> 00:56:25.36
And so we went and saw him in Brooklyn.

1146
00:56:25.36 --> 00:56:28.36
Me and my boys went down to Brooklyn to see him.

1147
00:56:28.36 --> 00:56:30.36
And we went berserk.

1148
00:56:30.36 --> 00:56:32.36
And he wasn't feeling that.

1149
00:56:32.36 --> 00:56:34.36
And he was like, and he had like longer curly hair.

1150
00:56:34.36 --> 00:56:36.36
And he's standing there.

1151
00:56:36.36 --> 00:56:39.36
And he put like, they played her first song and we just cleared out.

1152
00:56:39.36 --> 00:56:40.36
Yeah.

1153
00:56:40.36 --> 00:56:42.36
To destroy everything was like, he was like,

1154
00:56:42.36 --> 00:56:45.36
He was like, um, hey, I'm just trying to think what he says.

1155
00:56:45.36 --> 00:56:46.36
So he knows I'm not bullshit.

1156
00:56:46.36 --> 00:56:49.36
If you ever hears this, he said something along the lines of like,

1157
00:56:49.36 --> 00:56:52.36
let's leave our, let's leave our machoism and our ego is at the door.

1158
00:56:52.36 --> 00:56:55.36
You know, if you're going to dance, be cool or something like that.

1159
00:56:55.36 --> 00:56:57.36
And so then I was like,

1160
00:56:57.36 --> 00:56:59.36
What do I do now?

1161
00:56:59.36 --> 00:57:00.36
Music rocks.

1162
00:57:00.36 --> 00:57:02.36
I want to break stuff.

1163
00:57:02.36 --> 00:57:03.36
And I couldn't.

1164
00:57:03.36 --> 00:57:07.36
So, I remember when he started going that route.

1165
00:57:07.36 --> 00:57:08.36
And you know what God bless him.

1166
00:57:08.36 --> 00:57:10.36
No, man, you said he got a lot of respect for you.

1167
00:57:10.36 --> 00:57:11.36
I was fucking cool as fuck.

1168
00:57:11.36 --> 00:57:12.36
Yeah.

1169
00:57:12.36 --> 00:57:14.36
And he has always had his integrity.

1170
00:57:14.36 --> 00:57:17.36
And as he, as he matured,

1171
00:57:17.36 --> 00:57:19.36
you know,

1172
00:57:19.36 --> 00:57:21.36
his way of thinking.

1173
00:57:21.36 --> 00:57:23.36
Yeah, and you know what you got to respect him.

1174
00:57:23.36 --> 00:57:25.36
Yeah, he held the line with what he did.

1175
00:57:25.36 --> 00:57:27.36
And he's recklessly never sold out.

1176
00:57:27.36 --> 00:57:29.36
You know what hats off.

1177
00:57:29.36 --> 00:57:31.36
First of all, he's fucking legit man.

1178
00:57:31.36 --> 00:57:32.36
First of all, I got none.

1179
00:57:32.36 --> 00:57:33.36
First of all,

1180
00:57:33.36 --> 00:57:35.36
Now,

1181
00:57:35.36 --> 00:57:36.36
at this time,

1182
00:57:36.36 --> 00:57:39.36
used to break his balls fucking relentlessly though.

1183
00:57:39.36 --> 00:57:40.36
But that's just the way I am.

1184
00:57:40.36 --> 00:57:43.36
If I, if I like someone and respect the chances of I'm going to really

1185
00:57:43.36 --> 00:57:46.36
fuck with them whenever I have the opportunity.

1186
00:57:46.36 --> 00:57:47.36
You know,

1187
00:57:47.36 --> 00:57:52.36
yeah, um, so fuck you.

1188
00:57:52.36 --> 00:57:54.36
Yeah, I hear that.

1189
00:57:54.36 --> 00:57:55.36
At that time, you,

1190
00:57:55.36 --> 00:57:59.36
you kind of came up with the name of the Kromax name.

1191
00:57:59.36 --> 00:58:00.36
Yeah.

1192
00:58:00.36 --> 00:58:05.36
And you started like tagging everything with the old mags.

1193
00:58:05.36 --> 00:58:06.36
Yeah, yeah.

1194
00:58:06.36 --> 00:58:08.36
You just, you had a kick ass band.

1195
00:58:08.36 --> 00:58:10.36
That's like when we talked about my first

1196
00:58:10.36 --> 00:58:12.36
the hardcore band called Bronson's Children.

1197
00:58:12.36 --> 00:58:13.36
First thing we did,

1198
00:58:13.36 --> 00:58:14.36
no music.

1199
00:58:14.36 --> 00:58:15.36
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1200
00:58:15.36 --> 00:58:17.36
You got to hit it.

1201
00:58:17.36 --> 00:58:19.36
You put the merchandise.

1202
00:58:19.36 --> 00:58:21.36
So, you know, that's what we did.

1203
00:58:21.36 --> 00:58:23.36
But you were doing the same thing.

1204
00:58:23.36 --> 00:58:24.36
Yeah, we did that.

1205
00:58:24.36 --> 00:58:24.36
Right.

1206
00:58:24.36 --> 00:58:26.36
If you could actually play music, and I was just,

1207
00:58:26.36 --> 00:58:27.36
yeah.

1208
00:58:27.36 --> 00:58:28.36
Uh,

1209
00:58:28.36 --> 00:58:30.36
uh,

1210
00:58:30.36 --> 00:58:32.36
let's see what we're going with this one.

1211
00:58:32.36 --> 00:58:36.36
So you started coming, putting together the band.

1212
00:58:36.36 --> 00:58:41.36
And then things started getting a little bit crazy.

1213
00:58:41.36 --> 00:58:43.36
You beat someone up,

1214
00:58:43.36 --> 00:58:45.36
who's some friend of someone else, and all of a sudden,

1215
00:58:45.36 --> 00:58:47.36
you heard that you had like a price on your head.

1216
00:58:47.36 --> 00:58:49.36
That was actually before the Kromax really,

1217
00:58:49.36 --> 00:58:51.36
was the, yeah, it was pretty crombo.

1218
00:58:51.36 --> 00:58:52.36
It's like a band at the name.

1219
00:58:52.36 --> 00:58:55.36
Yeah, that's actually why I wound up,

1220
00:58:55.36 --> 00:58:56.36
um,

1221
00:58:56.36 --> 00:58:57.36
heading out to California.

1222
00:58:57.36 --> 00:59:00.36
I had to take a little break for my neighborhood.

1223
00:59:00.36 --> 00:59:01.36
Uh-huh.

1224
00:59:01.36 --> 00:59:03.36
Yeah, it was pretty intense, man.

1225
00:59:03.36 --> 00:59:04.36
This dude, um,

1226
00:59:04.36 --> 00:59:07.36
all right, there was a gang on my block called the Hitman.

1227
00:59:07.36 --> 00:59:08.36
And this is back, and, you know,

1228
00:59:08.36 --> 00:59:10.36
I remember them from the 70s through to the 80s.

1229
00:59:10.36 --> 00:59:12.36
I mean, this is when they still used to wear colors.

1230
00:59:12.36 --> 00:59:14.36
You know, patches on the,

1231
00:59:14.36 --> 00:59:17.36
in fact, the Puerto Rican gangs looked more like

1232
00:59:17.36 --> 00:59:19.36
bikers, like Puerto Rican bikers,

1233
00:59:19.36 --> 00:59:22.36
without bikes back then, like they all had like patches

1234
00:59:22.36 --> 00:59:24.36
and jeans and like MC boots,

1235
00:59:24.36 --> 00:59:26.36
and, you know, they'd wear like the F-True Pats

1236
00:59:26.36 --> 00:59:28.36
and with total old school, you know,

1237
00:59:28.36 --> 00:59:33.36
like, you know, wolf tails and shit, you know,

1238
00:59:33.36 --> 00:59:34.36
like the fur collar.

1239
00:59:34.36 --> 00:59:35.36
This is like ridiculous.

1240
00:59:35.36 --> 00:59:36.36
If you look on the old YouTube,

1241
00:59:36.36 --> 00:59:38.36
and then old photos of New York gangs would be like,

1242
00:59:38.36 --> 00:59:40.36
oh, okay, that's what he's talking about.

1243
00:59:40.36 --> 00:59:41.36
Anyway, yeah, these guys were fun.

1244
00:59:41.36 --> 00:59:42.36
Yeah, these guys were fucking,

1245
00:59:42.36 --> 00:59:43.36
there was no joke.

1246
00:59:43.36 --> 00:59:46.36
And one of the Hitman was Pigman,

1247
00:59:46.36 --> 00:59:48.36
and he, you know, they did hits.

1248
00:59:48.36 --> 00:59:50.36
They weren't called the Hitman, you know,

1249
00:59:50.36 --> 00:59:52.36
because they, you know, wrote hit songs.

1250
00:59:52.36 --> 00:59:54.36
You know, they, you know,

1251
00:59:54.36 --> 00:59:56.36
they beside selling heroin,

1252
00:59:56.36 --> 00:59:58.36
they did hits and,

1253
00:59:58.36 --> 01:00:01.36
pigman, I'd known about him,

1254
01:00:01.36 --> 01:00:02.36
my whole child,

1255
01:00:02.36 --> 01:00:06.36
he was like a lower-yside myth,

1256
01:00:06.36 --> 01:00:08.36
like, you know, everybody had heard of him,

1257
01:00:08.36 --> 01:00:09.36
but no one knew, you know,

1258
01:00:09.36 --> 01:00:11.36
because if you saw him,

1259
01:00:11.36 --> 01:00:13.36
most likely the last thing you saw,

1260
01:00:13.36 --> 01:00:14.36
you know,

1261
01:00:14.36 --> 01:00:16.36
but he would wear a pig's mask.

1262
01:00:16.36 --> 01:00:17.36
That's why he was called Pigman,

1263
01:00:17.36 --> 01:00:19.36
and he would pull up in his blue and over,

1264
01:00:19.36 --> 01:00:21.36
and fucking blast you with a shotgun.

1265
01:00:21.36 --> 01:00:23.36
And it was that simple.

1266
01:00:23.36 --> 01:00:27.36
And they actually kicked in a friend of mine's door

1267
01:00:27.36 --> 01:00:29.36
and put shoties and people's mouths

1268
01:00:29.36 --> 01:00:30.36
and guns to their heads,

1269
01:00:30.36 --> 01:00:33.36
whereas Harley and one of the skin head apartments

1270
01:00:33.36 --> 01:00:34.36
looking for me,

1271
01:00:34.36 --> 01:00:36.36
and they came to my squat,

1272
01:00:36.36 --> 01:00:38.36
pulled someone into a corner,

1273
01:00:38.36 --> 01:00:39.36
and put knives to their throats,

1274
01:00:39.36 --> 01:00:41.36
which apartments Harley in,

1275
01:00:41.36 --> 01:00:44.36
and Pigman was cruisin' by my friends

1276
01:00:44.36 --> 01:00:45.36
with the mask on,

1277
01:00:45.36 --> 01:00:47.36
and didn't see me,

1278
01:00:47.36 --> 01:00:49.36
so kept driving, I guess.

1279
01:00:49.36 --> 01:00:51.36
So it was real.

1280
01:00:51.36 --> 01:00:53.36
And I'm like,

1281
01:00:53.36 --> 01:00:54.36
I was like,

1282
01:00:54.36 --> 01:00:56.36
15, you know,

1283
01:00:56.36 --> 01:00:57.36
I mean, I'm 15,

1284
01:00:57.36 --> 01:00:59.36
I got fucking pigman looking for me.

1285
01:00:59.36 --> 01:01:00.36
I mean, that's fucking no joke.

1286
01:01:00.36 --> 01:01:02.36
This is Pigman motherfuck, you know,

1287
01:01:02.36 --> 01:01:04.36
Pigman!

1288
01:01:04.36 --> 01:01:05.36
You know,

1289
01:01:05.36 --> 01:01:07.36
I'm like,

1290
01:01:07.36 --> 01:01:08.36
telling the locals,

1291
01:01:08.36 --> 01:01:09.36
I'm like,

1292
01:01:09.36 --> 01:01:09.36
I'm like,

1293
01:01:09.36 --> 01:01:11.36
shit man, my mother lives on 12th street.

1294
01:01:11.36 --> 01:01:12.36
We know what the fuck I don't know.

1295
01:01:12.36 --> 01:01:13.36
What about her?

1296
01:01:13.36 --> 01:01:14.36
I don't worry about your mom,

1297
01:01:14.36 --> 01:01:15.36
everybody loves your mom.

1298
01:01:15.36 --> 01:01:17.36
This is not personal, man.

1299
01:01:17.36 --> 01:01:18.36
There's money on it all.

1300
01:01:18.36 --> 01:01:19.36
You know, this is business.

1301
01:01:19.36 --> 01:01:21.36
But you should get out of here, man.

1302
01:01:21.36 --> 01:01:22.36
You should hang low.

1303
01:01:22.36 --> 01:01:24.36
These are your four to recon brothers telling you that.

1304
01:01:24.36 --> 01:01:25.36
Yeah,

1305
01:01:25.36 --> 01:01:26.36
like the guys in the block,

1306
01:01:26.36 --> 01:01:28.36
just people who know me from school,

1307
01:01:28.36 --> 01:01:28.36
like people like,

1308
01:01:28.36 --> 01:01:29.36
you know,

1309
01:01:29.36 --> 01:01:30.36
my friends on cools and shit like that,

1310
01:01:30.36 --> 01:01:31.36
you know,

1311
01:01:31.36 --> 01:01:31.36
like,

1312
01:01:31.36 --> 01:01:32.36
you should get the fuck out of here.

1313
01:01:32.36 --> 01:01:33.36
I'm like,

1314
01:01:33.36 --> 01:01:34.36
you know what I think I'll will.

1315
01:01:34.36 --> 01:01:35.36
Yeah.

1316
01:01:35.36 --> 01:01:36.36
So that's just,

1317
01:01:36.36 --> 01:01:37.36
that's because you beat somebody up.

1318
01:01:37.36 --> 01:01:38.36
Yeah,

1319
01:01:38.36 --> 01:01:39.36
I used to,

1320
01:01:39.36 --> 01:01:41.36
I used to get in a lot of fights,

1321
01:01:41.36 --> 01:01:42.36
and I used to also,

1322
01:01:42.36 --> 01:01:43.36
you know,

1323
01:01:45.36 --> 01:01:46.36
yeah,

1324
01:01:46.36 --> 01:01:47.36
I beat someone up.

1325
01:01:47.36 --> 01:01:48.36
And it turned out he was a,

1326
01:01:48.36 --> 01:01:50.36
it was this guy who was a,

1327
01:01:50.36 --> 01:01:53.36
a owner of one of the after hours clubs.

1328
01:01:53.36 --> 01:01:54.36
I'm a lower East side.

1329
01:01:54.36 --> 01:01:56.36
And a lot of these after hours clubs,

1330
01:01:56.36 --> 01:01:57.36
like,

1331
01:01:57.36 --> 01:01:57.36
you know,

1332
01:01:57.36 --> 01:01:59.36
saved the robots and the pyramid,

1333
01:01:59.36 --> 01:02:01.36
and all these other places they had,

1334
01:02:01.36 --> 01:02:01.36
like,

1335
01:02:01.36 --> 01:02:02.36
you know,

1336
01:02:02.36 --> 01:02:04.36
they were the late night free clubs,

1337
01:02:04.36 --> 01:02:06.36
where everybody would go like to a six in the morning,

1338
01:02:06.36 --> 01:02:08.36
and they would all be doing blow and doing coke.

1339
01:02:08.36 --> 01:02:10.36
So I guess that's how they knew the hitman,

1340
01:02:10.36 --> 01:02:14.36
because they all used to all the club freaks used to buy all their drugs from the Puerto Rican and the neighborhood.

1341
01:02:14.36 --> 01:02:16.36
So we were kind of fucking up their business too,

1342
01:02:16.36 --> 01:02:17.36
because we were like,

1343
01:02:17.36 --> 01:02:18.36
fucking up all the,

1344
01:02:18.36 --> 01:02:21.36
all the new freaks that we started to come to the lower East side,

1345
01:02:21.36 --> 01:02:23.36
all the new white people that we were like,

1346
01:02:23.36 --> 01:02:23.36
you know,

1347
01:02:23.36 --> 01:02:24.36
fuck,

1348
01:02:24.36 --> 01:02:26.36
we just made this motherfucking neighborhood safe.

1349
01:02:26.36 --> 01:02:28.36
Now you motherfuckers all think you just,

1350
01:02:28.36 --> 01:02:29.36
the gangbusters like,

1351
01:02:29.36 --> 01:02:31.36
you're all just a flood this fucking fuck this.

1352
01:02:31.36 --> 01:02:33.36
There's our neighborhood now.

1353
01:02:33.36 --> 01:02:34.36
You know,

1354
01:02:34.36 --> 01:02:35.36
so yeah,

1355
01:02:35.36 --> 01:02:35.36
you know,

1356
01:02:35.36 --> 01:02:36.36
I was an asshole.

1357
01:02:36.36 --> 01:02:37.36
I mean,

1358
01:02:37.36 --> 01:02:38.36
I have to admit that,

1359
01:02:38.36 --> 01:02:38.36
you know,

1360
01:02:38.36 --> 01:02:40.36
look at back if you know,

1361
01:02:40.36 --> 01:02:41.36
if you ever kind of met up,

1362
01:02:41.36 --> 01:02:42.36
you have to be able to say,

1363
01:02:42.36 --> 01:02:43.36
yes,

1364
01:02:43.36 --> 01:02:44.36
I wasn't an asshole,

1365
01:02:44.36 --> 01:02:45.36
you know,

1366
01:02:45.36 --> 01:02:46.36
but that shit,

1367
01:02:46.36 --> 01:02:47.36
yeah,

1368
01:02:47.36 --> 01:02:48.36
pig man was no joke.

1369
01:02:48.36 --> 01:02:49.36
And I went to California,

1370
01:02:49.36 --> 01:02:50.36
shit died off,

1371
01:02:50.36 --> 01:02:51.36
I came back.

1372
01:02:51.36 --> 01:02:52.36
Dude,

1373
01:02:52.36 --> 01:02:53.36
you went to California,

1374
01:02:53.36 --> 01:02:55.36
and I was reading that part of the fucking,

1375
01:02:55.36 --> 01:02:56.36
yeah.

1376
01:02:56.36 --> 01:02:58.36
What in God's name is going on?

1377
01:02:58.36 --> 01:02:59.36
Yeah.

1378
01:02:59.36 --> 01:03:01.36
Dude,

1379
01:03:01.36 --> 01:03:02.36
talk about the facts.

1380
01:03:02.36 --> 01:03:03.36
Yeah,

1381
01:03:03.36 --> 01:03:04.36
man,

1382
01:03:04.36 --> 01:03:06.36
we were living in an abandoned brewery.

1383
01:03:06.36 --> 01:03:07.36
There was,

1384
01:03:07.36 --> 01:03:08.36
you know,

1385
01:03:08.36 --> 01:03:09.36
couple hundred kids living there probably.

1386
01:03:09.36 --> 01:03:11.36
We were all living in the actual

1387
01:03:11.36 --> 01:03:13.36
facts that they used to have.

1388
01:03:13.36 --> 01:03:15.36
The rubber coated square rooms,

1389
01:03:15.36 --> 01:03:17.36
like with a man holigan and an out of,

1390
01:03:17.36 --> 01:03:18.36
and you know,

1391
01:03:18.36 --> 01:03:19.36
we were living in the,

1392
01:03:19.36 --> 01:03:20.36
air vents.

1393
01:03:20.36 --> 01:03:21.36
And yeah,

1394
01:03:21.36 --> 01:03:22.36
I was fucking crazy,

1395
01:03:22.36 --> 01:03:23.36
man,

1396
01:03:23.36 --> 01:03:24.36
and everybody was fucked up on drugs.

1397
01:03:24.36 --> 01:03:25.36
Everybody was runaway.

1398
01:03:25.36 --> 01:03:26.36
Everybody was,

1399
01:03:26.36 --> 01:03:27.36
you know,

1400
01:03:27.36 --> 01:03:28.36
it was,

1401
01:03:28.36 --> 01:03:30.36
what it means is me about the 80s,

1402
01:03:30.36 --> 01:03:32.36
is the lawlessness,

1403
01:03:32.36 --> 01:03:33.36
you know,

1404
01:03:33.36 --> 01:03:35.36
in New York and in San Francisco,

1405
01:03:35.36 --> 01:03:36.36
you know,

1406
01:03:36.36 --> 01:03:38.36
like you could really get away with just about,

1407
01:03:38.36 --> 01:03:39.36
fucking anything,

1408
01:03:39.36 --> 01:03:43.36
and there would be like no police,

1409
01:03:43.36 --> 01:03:44.36
involvement,

1410
01:03:44.36 --> 01:03:46.36
no repercussion,

1411
01:03:46.36 --> 01:03:47.36
you know,

1412
01:03:47.36 --> 01:03:48.36
I mean,

1413
01:03:48.36 --> 01:03:50.36
you'd get into a fight and the shit could go on for,

1414
01:03:50.36 --> 01:03:51.36
half a fucking hour,

1415
01:03:51.36 --> 01:03:53.36
like from one area to another,

1416
01:03:53.36 --> 01:03:54.36
and back and forth,

1417
01:03:54.36 --> 01:03:54.36
you know,

1418
01:03:54.36 --> 01:03:55.36
you're guns,

1419
01:03:55.36 --> 01:03:55.36
oh,

1420
01:03:55.36 --> 01:03:55.36
fight.

1421
01:03:55.36 --> 01:03:56.36
Yeah,

1422
01:03:56.36 --> 01:03:56.36
like,

1423
01:03:56.36 --> 01:03:56.36
I mean,

1424
01:03:56.36 --> 01:03:57.36
you would fucking start fighting on that.

1425
01:03:57.36 --> 01:03:58.36
You know,

1426
01:03:58.36 --> 01:03:59.36
you could start fighting on that.

1427
01:03:59.36 --> 01:04:00.36
You know,

1428
01:04:00.36 --> 01:04:01.36
you could start fighting on that.

1429
01:04:01.36 --> 01:04:02.36
You know,

1430
01:04:02.36 --> 01:04:03.36
you could end up on first to have a new,

1431
01:04:03.36 --> 01:04:03.36
over on seventh,

1432
01:04:03.36 --> 01:04:05.36
then back over to Aidstreet and back down to,

1433
01:04:05.36 --> 01:04:07.36
Avenue A and it's like mad,

1434
01:04:07.36 --> 01:04:09.36
screaming and,

1435
01:04:09.36 --> 01:04:10.36
you know,

1436
01:04:10.36 --> 01:04:11.36
stabbing,

1437
01:04:11.36 --> 01:04:13.36
and bottles breaking and no cops,

1438
01:04:13.36 --> 01:04:14.36
you know,

1439
01:04:14.36 --> 01:04:16.36
that was like,

1440
01:04:16.36 --> 01:04:18.36
you know,

1441
01:04:18.36 --> 01:04:19.36
I mean,

1442
01:04:19.36 --> 01:04:20.36
shit happens now,

1443
01:04:20.36 --> 01:04:20.36
man,

1444
01:04:20.36 --> 01:04:22.36
you fart to fucking loud on the street here.

1445
01:04:22.36 --> 01:04:23.36
You got arrested.

1446
01:04:23.36 --> 01:04:24.36
You know,

1447
01:04:24.36 --> 01:04:25.36
you know,

1448
01:04:25.36 --> 01:04:26.36
you're 15 years old.

1449
01:04:26.36 --> 01:04:27.36
You're in a,

1450
01:04:27.36 --> 01:04:27.36
you know,

1451
01:04:27.36 --> 01:04:28.36
you're in a fact.

1452
01:04:28.36 --> 01:04:28.36
Yeah.

1453
01:04:28.36 --> 01:04:28.36
Yeah.

1454
01:04:28.36 --> 01:04:28.36
Yeah.

1455
01:04:28.36 --> 01:04:28.36
Yeah.

1456
01:04:28.36 --> 01:04:30.36
In San Francisco with a bunch of,

1457
01:04:30.36 --> 01:04:31.36
everyone's run away.

1458
01:04:31.36 --> 01:04:32.36
run away for everybody's,

1459
01:04:32.36 --> 01:04:32.36
the...

1460
01:04:32.36 --> 01:04:32.36
yeah.

1461
01:04:32.36 --> 01:04:34.36
Mad Crystal,

1462
01:04:34.36 --> 01:04:34.36
Mad...

1463
01:04:34.36 --> 01:04:36.36
Fucken shooting and Crystal left right front and center dropping.

1464
01:04:36.36 --> 01:04:37.36
Look with acid in their eyeballs.

1465
01:04:37.36 --> 01:04:38.36
Yeah.

1466
01:04:38.36 --> 01:04:39.36
I was,

1467
01:04:39.36 --> 01:04:42.36
How's that even, like,

1468
01:04:42.36 --> 01:04:44.36
How do you process that?

1469
01:04:44.36 --> 01:04:46.36
And the other weird thing is,

1470
01:04:46.36 --> 01:04:46.36
is like,

1471
01:04:46.36 --> 01:04:47.36
you're surviving,

1472
01:04:47.36 --> 01:04:47.36
like,

1473
01:04:47.36 --> 01:04:48.36
yeah.

1474
01:04:48.36 --> 01:04:49.36
you're,

1475
01:04:49.36 --> 01:04:49.36
you're,

1476
01:04:49.36 --> 01:04:50.36
you're getting food somehow, right?

1477
01:04:50.36 --> 01:04:50.36
Yeah.

1478
01:04:50.36 --> 01:04:51.36
You're stealing food.

1479
01:04:51.36 --> 01:04:52.36
You're lifting your food.

1480
01:04:52.36 --> 01:04:53.36
You're lifting your food.

1481
01:04:53.36 --> 01:04:54.36
You're lifting your food.

1482
01:04:54.36 --> 01:04:55.36
You're lifting your food.

1483
01:04:55.36 --> 01:04:58.96
You're lifting, paying handling, and mugging people.

1484
01:04:58.96 --> 01:05:01.96
You know, figuring it out, figuring it out.

1485
01:05:01.96 --> 01:05:04.76
And that's what everyone in this fat these days are doing.

1486
01:05:04.76 --> 01:05:06.88
Yeah, well, I mean, there was only a couple of us

1487
01:05:06.88 --> 01:05:08.84
that were out mugging people because there was only

1488
01:05:08.84 --> 01:05:11.24
like me and Mark Dagger and a couple of other people

1489
01:05:11.24 --> 01:05:14.000
who were like hard asses, everybody else was either

1490
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.24
out, paying handling or turning tricks.

1491
01:05:16.24 --> 01:05:20.20
You know, it was like, you know, you either out mugging

1492
01:05:20.20 --> 01:05:24.32
someone, suckin' a dick, or begging for change.

1493
01:05:24.32 --> 01:05:29.04
You know, and we, did you just think like,

1494
01:05:29.04 --> 01:05:30.96
okay, this is what life is like?

1495
01:05:30.96 --> 01:05:33.40
Yeah, that's what life was like.

1496
01:05:33.40 --> 01:05:39.76
You know, I remember like eating it soup kitchens,

1497
01:05:39.76 --> 01:05:42.32
you know, with adults and I'm like 15.

1498
01:05:42.32 --> 01:05:44.88
And that being weird and almost getting into fights

1499
01:05:44.88 --> 01:05:47.20
with like dudes who were like X-cons

1500
01:05:47.20 --> 01:05:49.48
and you know, like dudes who had just got out of prison

1501
01:05:49.48 --> 01:05:50.60
who were like to them.

1502
01:05:50.60 --> 01:05:52.32
They were still in the prison lunch room.

1503
01:05:52.32 --> 01:05:55.08
You know, and to me, I'm just like trying to,

1504
01:05:55.08 --> 01:05:58.80
you know, get some food, you know.

1505
01:05:58.80 --> 01:06:01.12
And yeah, it was pretty intense, you know.

1506
01:06:01.12 --> 01:06:05.48
I mean, but to be fair, I had a great fucking time.

1507
01:06:05.48 --> 01:06:08.64
You know, I mean, I had a lot of fun, you know.

1508
01:06:08.64 --> 01:06:11.40
The, the, the, the, the bartering, the violence, the drugs.

1509
01:06:11.40 --> 01:06:13.40
I had a fucking blast.

1510
01:06:13.40 --> 01:06:14.96
I, would I recommend any of it?

1511
01:06:14.96 --> 01:06:18.64
No, would I wish it on my kids or my worst enemies?

1512
01:06:18.64 --> 01:06:20.84
No, did I have a great time?

1513
01:06:20.84 --> 01:06:22.20
Yes.

1514
01:06:22.20 --> 01:06:25.64
You know, I had the, how I fucking made it.

1515
01:06:25.64 --> 01:06:29.76
I don't know, but, you know, I guess it's, I guess,

1516
01:06:29.76 --> 01:06:31.20
is that like when people talk about,

1517
01:06:31.20 --> 01:06:34.28
well, when people say to me, oh, I think this is the same thing

1518
01:06:34.28 --> 01:06:35.92
because I'm sitting here going to happen that before.

1519
01:06:35.92 --> 01:06:38.60
But I guess, yeah, no, dude, people I think about like being

1520
01:06:38.60 --> 01:06:41.92
not think about the most intense situations you've been in.

1521
01:06:41.92 --> 01:06:45.56
It's like the adrenaline, the fucking, like dude,

1522
01:06:45.56 --> 01:06:48.20
the last time I got in like a real fucking crate,

1523
01:06:48.20 --> 01:06:51.44
you know, not the last time, the third or fourth to last time.

1524
01:06:51.44 --> 01:06:54.20
I got in a really bad violent situation.

1525
01:06:54.20 --> 01:06:57.64
Like, one, it's in the book when I got, had like,

1526
01:06:57.64 --> 01:07:00.16
that I fucked up this dude who was in a gang.

1527
01:07:00.16 --> 01:07:02.76
And the next thing I know I got like 30 dudes fucking coming

1528
01:07:02.76 --> 01:07:04.56
after me with pipes, bads, bop, bop, bop, bop,

1529
01:07:04.56 --> 01:07:05.80
smashing out our windows.

1530
01:07:05.80 --> 01:07:09.56
And I'm running into the crowd of them to save a friend of mine.

1531
01:07:09.56 --> 01:07:14.92
Now see, like, dude, I was fucking like high for like a week

1532
01:07:14.92 --> 01:07:16.32
off of the adrenaline.

1533
01:07:16.32 --> 01:07:17.80
And then when I finally came down,

1534
01:07:17.80 --> 01:07:20.84
I was like, whoa, what the fuck was that, man?

1535
01:07:20.84 --> 01:07:24.52
I could have died, you know, but like for literally a week

1536
01:07:24.52 --> 01:07:29.52
after that shit, I was just like, yeah, I fucking bring it.

1537
01:07:29.52 --> 01:07:33.52
You know, and, and, you know, that's like,

1538
01:07:33.52 --> 01:07:35.72
but that's the difference between certain type of people.

1539
01:07:35.72 --> 01:07:40.36
Like, you know, I will run into a fucking violence

1540
01:07:40.36 --> 01:07:41.32
to save a friend.

1541
01:07:41.32 --> 01:07:42.32
Yeah.

1542
01:07:42.32 --> 01:07:46.04
And a lot of fucking people that I grew up with will fucking

1543
01:07:46.04 --> 01:07:50.84
punk out, I've seen people that I respected.

1544
01:07:50.84 --> 01:07:54.84
Fucking run and leave their friends behind.

1545
01:07:54.84 --> 01:07:57.24
And there's some real pussy shit, especially when they're trying

1546
01:07:57.24 --> 01:07:59.88
to be all badass skinheads, get to, you know,

1547
01:07:59.88 --> 01:08:00.88
oh, yeah, something down.

1548
01:08:00.88 --> 01:08:03.84
Are you a nun, but a bitch, you know?

1549
01:08:03.84 --> 01:08:09.000
And, hey, man, and, you know, and that's one reason why I'm really

1550
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.64
fucking proud to be here, you know, because it's like, you guys,

1551
01:08:12.64 --> 01:08:17.40
one of the things I respect the most is someone who will put

1552
01:08:17.40 --> 01:08:21.28
themselves on the line for someone else.

1553
01:08:21.28 --> 01:08:26.88
Like, when you will put your own life at risk for another

1554
01:08:26.88 --> 01:08:32.16
person, there's nothing more admirable than that.

1555
01:08:32.16 --> 01:08:37.72
So hats off to you guys and to all, all the military out there,

1556
01:08:37.72 --> 01:08:41.80
you know, serving this country and serving their brothers,

1557
01:08:41.80 --> 01:08:44.40
sisters, their families and everybody, you know, hats off,

1558
01:08:44.40 --> 01:08:47.88
man, it takes a lot of fucking balls and I respect.

1559
01:08:47.88 --> 01:08:51.64
And I'm not, you know, even law enforcement, you know, and I'm not

1560
01:08:51.64 --> 01:08:55.24
a big fan of the police in many circles.

1561
01:08:55.24 --> 01:08:58.12
I've become friends with a lot of cops since I started doing

1562
01:08:58.12 --> 01:08:59.12
jujitsu.

1563
01:08:59.12 --> 01:09:00.76
Do you two change a lot of things for the cops?

1564
01:09:00.76 --> 01:09:05.12
But, however, you know, I still have my reservations, but I

1565
01:09:05.12 --> 01:09:09.08
respect, again, anybody who is willing to put their life on

1566
01:09:09.08 --> 01:09:12.56
the line for others and for the greater good, you know,

1567
01:09:12.56 --> 01:09:15.64
and there's really nothing higher.

1568
01:09:15.64 --> 01:09:16.64
Yeah, you know.

1569
01:09:16.64 --> 01:09:17.64
Yeah.

1570
01:09:17.64 --> 01:09:21.36
Well, like obviously, I've got my work with the police and

1571
01:09:21.36 --> 01:09:23.24
they're the same way man.

1572
01:09:23.24 --> 01:09:25.04
They're, and they got a f-d-shhh.

1573
01:09:25.04 --> 01:09:26.80
They got one of the hardest jobs in all of the world.

1574
01:09:26.80 --> 01:09:29.000
No, no, look, I say that with, you know, a little bit

1575
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.92
tongue and cheeky, you know, I mean, it's like I've grown up

1576
01:09:30.92 --> 01:09:33.36
always being on the shitty end of the stick when it comes to the

1577
01:09:33.36 --> 01:09:34.36
cops.

1578
01:09:34.36 --> 01:09:36.84
And, you know, still to this day, even like when I'm trying to get

1579
01:09:36.84 --> 01:09:39.56
something achieved and accomplished and I try to go to them

1580
01:09:39.56 --> 01:09:42.000
for guidance, they still look at me like they want to

1581
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
slap the cuff on me.

1582
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.60
More than fucking help me out, you know.

1583
01:09:45.60 --> 01:09:50.40
So, you know, but, you know, I'm just, but I do understand,

1584
01:09:50.40 --> 01:09:54.60
you know, what they deal with on a regular basis.

1585
01:09:54.60 --> 01:09:55.96
So, I get it.

1586
01:09:55.96 --> 01:09:58.84
But I also think that a lot of people are attracted towards

1587
01:09:58.84 --> 01:10:02.44
lines of work that give them a position where they can

1588
01:10:02.44 --> 01:10:04.24
abuse their position.

1589
01:10:04.24 --> 01:10:06.000
You know, I think that happened.

1590
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.76
That's the human race, though.

1591
01:10:07.76 --> 01:10:11.60
I mean, it's not like a go do a ride along with some cops,

1592
01:10:11.60 --> 01:10:12.60
man.

1593
01:10:12.60 --> 01:10:13.60
I do it.

1594
01:10:13.60 --> 01:10:13.60
It is.

1595
01:10:13.60 --> 01:10:14.60
I couldn't do it, man.

1596
01:10:14.60 --> 01:10:18.40
But cops is just, what they deal with on a day to day

1597
01:10:18.40 --> 01:10:19.80
basis, what it does to the brain.

1598
01:10:19.80 --> 01:10:23.04
No, I mean, it looks, you know, hard ass job.

1599
01:10:23.04 --> 01:10:24.60
People don't understand.

1600
01:10:24.60 --> 01:10:28.20
I mean, it's like there's a certain level of, you know,

1601
01:10:28.20 --> 01:10:34.20
once you've seen some shit, you're always on that edge,

1602
01:10:34.20 --> 01:10:39.08
yeah, you know, and that fight that fight of flight, you know,

1603
01:10:39.08 --> 01:10:41.16
and unfortunately, they don't have the choice.

1604
01:10:41.16 --> 01:10:42.12
They have no choice.

1605
01:10:42.12 --> 01:10:42.96
They have to deal with it.

1606
01:10:42.96 --> 01:10:43.60
They've got to fight.

1607
01:10:43.60 --> 01:10:47.64
So, you know, so, and they got to protect, you know,

1608
01:10:47.64 --> 01:10:51.08
to, of course, you see, oh, we always see the negative thing of

1609
01:10:51.08 --> 01:10:54.40
cops, but they're trying to work within certain guidelines.

1610
01:10:54.40 --> 01:10:55.60
And that makes you the heart.

1611
01:10:55.60 --> 01:10:58.80
And at the end of the time, they're going, no, hey, sir,

1612
01:10:58.80 --> 01:11:00.96
please put the bat down, put the knife down.

1613
01:11:00.96 --> 01:11:01.72
That's what they're doing.

1614
01:11:01.72 --> 01:11:05.76
I think I said, sucks, you know, sucks to hard ass job.

1615
01:11:05.76 --> 01:11:06.28
Hard ass job.

1616
01:11:06.28 --> 01:11:09.32
But, you know, again, I got, you know, I also got to play,

1617
01:11:09.32 --> 01:11:12.08
I got to keep my one foot grounded in the streets.

1618
01:11:12.08 --> 01:11:14.80
I still have my, you know, you were, yeah,

1619
01:11:14.80 --> 01:11:18.80
your condition, yes, from your childhood, yeah.

1620
01:11:18.80 --> 01:11:22.08
That the man, you were on the other side,

1621
01:11:22.08 --> 01:11:23.48
you were on the other side, man.

1622
01:11:23.48 --> 01:11:24.68
You're on the other side.

1623
01:11:24.68 --> 01:11:26.84
And so now that's how your condition is.

1624
01:11:26.84 --> 01:11:30.92
We just, just like when they, when they see you,

1625
01:11:30.92 --> 01:11:33.000
well, I don't know if they see you now.

1626
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.36
Well, you know, yeah, things are a little different now,

1627
01:11:35.36 --> 01:11:40.36
but, you know, hey, you know, what the fucking you're gonna do?

1628
01:11:40.36 --> 01:11:43.40
Well, I'll tell you what I do.

1629
01:11:43.40 --> 01:11:44.68
When the cops tell you do something.

1630
01:11:44.68 --> 01:11:45.52
Oh, I do it.

1631
01:11:45.52 --> 01:11:46.36
I don't fucking run.

1632
01:11:46.36 --> 01:11:47.24
I'm like, look, obviously.

1633
01:11:47.24 --> 01:11:48.24
No problem.

1634
01:11:48.24 --> 01:11:49.84
Not, not, no problem.

1635
01:11:49.84 --> 01:11:50.68
No problem.

1636
01:11:50.68 --> 01:11:51.68
That's how you, that's how you make friends.

1637
01:11:51.68 --> 01:11:53.84
Yeah, I see my stupid fucking friends were like,

1638
01:11:53.84 --> 01:11:55.60
yo fuck that, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1639
01:11:55.60 --> 01:11:58.16
It's like, fuck this problem.

1640
01:11:58.16 --> 01:11:59.88
All you had to do is say, yes, sir,

1641
01:11:59.88 --> 01:12:01.56
how fucking difficult is that?

1642
01:12:01.56 --> 01:12:04.32
You know, motherfucker, you that stupid.

1643
01:12:06.32 --> 01:12:08.68
Man, we haven't even gotten to like the Chrome Mags yet.

1644
01:12:08.68 --> 01:12:09.84
Have we?

1645
01:12:09.84 --> 01:12:10.68
Who the Chrome Mags?

1646
01:12:10.68 --> 01:12:11.84
Oh, yeah.

1647
01:12:11.84 --> 01:12:14.20
Like put together the first album, you know what I mean?

1648
01:12:14.20 --> 01:12:15.04
Yeah.

1649
01:12:15.84 --> 01:12:16.68
Shit.

1650
01:12:18.44 --> 01:12:19.28
So,

1651
01:12:21.64 --> 01:12:23.60
you guys finally get together.

1652
01:12:23.60 --> 01:12:24.80
Here we go, back to the book.

1653
01:12:24.80 --> 01:12:26.72
It been three years since Paris and you,

1654
01:12:26.72 --> 01:12:28.04
so Paris, the guy was,

1655
01:12:28.04 --> 01:12:29.84
he was the guitarist from the Chrome Mags.

1656
01:12:29.84 --> 01:12:33.92
He hooked up and started writing November 2nd, 1984.

1657
01:12:33.92 --> 01:12:36.68
And on February 16th, 1985,

1658
01:12:36.68 --> 01:12:38.60
the Chrome Mags went into high five studios

1659
01:12:38.60 --> 01:12:41.72
on 27th Street and Park Avenue recorded 12 songs,

1660
01:12:41.72 --> 01:12:44.04
the Age of Coral cassette,

1661
01:12:44.04 --> 01:12:46.80
which is released on CD called Before the Coral.

1662
01:12:46.80 --> 01:12:49.04
Yeah, that was the original version of the album

1663
01:12:49.04 --> 01:12:52.96
before we actually went and recorded the album,

1664
01:12:52.96 --> 01:12:53.80
Age of Coral.

1665
01:12:53.80 --> 01:12:55.12
So that's 84.

1666
01:12:55.12 --> 01:12:55.64
Yeah.

1667
01:12:55.64 --> 01:12:56.64
That that's going down.

1668
01:12:56.64 --> 01:12:57.32
Yes.

1669
01:12:57.32 --> 01:13:01.12
And that's a good recording.

1670
01:13:01.12 --> 01:13:02.08
I have that too.

1671
01:13:02.08 --> 01:13:05.36
I actually like it a lot better than the album I was telling you before.

1672
01:13:05.36 --> 01:13:06.88
I can't tell if I, I, I,

1673
01:13:06.88 --> 01:13:07.88
I like it so much.

1674
01:13:07.88 --> 01:13:11.04
I've recorded my head that I expect little things

1675
01:13:11.04 --> 01:13:11.88
that aren't there.

1676
01:13:11.88 --> 01:13:13.80
And so I, I like the first one better

1677
01:13:13.80 --> 01:13:15.24
because I think it's this more raw.

1678
01:13:15.24 --> 01:13:17.76
It is more, you know, that it's more explosive.

1679
01:13:17.76 --> 01:13:20.44
I think it's more true to what we actually sounded like

1680
01:13:20.44 --> 01:13:22.88
when we played live, you know?

1681
01:13:22.88 --> 01:13:23.56
Yeah.

1682
01:13:23.56 --> 01:13:25.76
The other thing, the other one had,

1683
01:13:25.76 --> 01:13:28.72
you know, a lot of productions shit that I wasn't too happy about.

1684
01:13:28.72 --> 01:13:29.56
But yeah.

1685
01:13:29.56 --> 01:13:32.76
So now this is where now you think the story has been crazy so far.

1686
01:13:32.76 --> 01:13:34.76
Echo, I'll just throw you into the bus right now.

1687
01:13:34.76 --> 01:13:36.32
The story has been crazy.

1688
01:13:36.32 --> 01:13:39.04
Now it goes just takes another kind of,

1689
01:13:39.04 --> 01:13:42.56
what I, I consider it's an even more, more bizarre turn

1690
01:13:42.56 --> 01:13:45.04
than everything we've talked about so far.

1691
01:13:45.04 --> 01:13:46.72
So going back to the book,

1692
01:13:48.32 --> 01:13:50.28
I was into vegetarianism,

1693
01:13:50.28 --> 01:13:52.76
but it took me a while to get into Krishna.

1694
01:13:52.76 --> 01:13:55.68
At first, John, this is the singer from the Chrome AG

1695
01:13:55.68 --> 01:13:58.28
or one of the singers that sang into Chrome AGs,

1696
01:13:58.28 --> 01:14:00.52
John and me used to go to the trucks

1697
01:14:00.52 --> 01:14:02.28
where they served free food and Tom,

1698
01:14:02.28 --> 01:14:05.44
Compton Square Park, which was a big hangout back in the day.

1699
01:14:05.44 --> 01:14:07.76
And everyone used to go there and hang out.

1700
01:14:07.76 --> 01:14:09.80
A lot of hard-cork kids did.

1701
01:14:09.80 --> 01:14:11.56
I mean, I was living in a squat.

1702
01:14:11.56 --> 01:14:12.56
I was vegetarian.

1703
01:14:12.56 --> 01:14:16.60
I had no money and here was free vegetarian food.

1704
01:14:16.60 --> 01:14:19.84
They also had a few preaching centers on the west side

1705
01:14:19.84 --> 01:14:22.64
that me and John used to go to to eat,

1706
01:14:22.64 --> 01:14:27.04
but still it took a while to give a fuck about what they were saying.

1707
01:14:27.04 --> 01:14:28.52
I was there for the free food.

1708
01:14:28.52 --> 01:14:29.72
I wasn't looking for religion.

1709
01:14:29.72 --> 01:14:31.56
I was just hungry and trying to survive.

1710
01:14:31.56 --> 01:14:32.76
We would always show up late.

1711
01:14:32.76 --> 01:14:36.000
John would tell us when the good time was just to get the food,

1712
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
after the reading and preaching and everything.

1713
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.72
But over time, I really started getting into the philosophy.

1714
01:14:40.72 --> 01:14:42.88
In the beginning, people didn't take John and Krishna

1715
01:14:42.88 --> 01:14:43.72
seriously.

1716
01:14:43.72 --> 01:14:47.28
It was kind of something the hardcore scene laughed at.

1717
01:14:47.28 --> 01:14:49.60
But as my friends and me started getting into Krishna,

1718
01:14:49.60 --> 01:14:50.44
it started to change.

1719
01:14:50.44 --> 01:14:53.64
So you guys started getting into Harry Krishna?

1720
01:14:53.64 --> 01:14:54.48
Yeah.

1721
01:14:54.48 --> 01:14:55.32
Yes.

1722
01:14:55.32 --> 01:14:58.32
Which is pretty funny looking back now.

1723
01:14:58.32 --> 01:15:01.44
Tell me the fundamental philosophies.

1724
01:15:01.44 --> 01:15:02.80
I mean, obviously,

1725
01:15:02.80 --> 01:15:04.56
Harry Krishna's are vegetarian.

1726
01:15:04.56 --> 01:15:05.08
Yes.

1727
01:15:05.08 --> 01:15:08.20
Because they don't want to hurt animals.

1728
01:15:08.20 --> 01:15:10.04
Actually, it's more to it than that.

1729
01:15:10.04 --> 01:15:13.24
It's actually not why it's because now I'm going to start fucking

1730
01:15:13.24 --> 01:15:14.40
and talk another shit.

1731
01:15:14.40 --> 01:15:15.60
Well, give me a little bit of it.

1732
01:15:15.60 --> 01:15:18.16
It's a big thing that they only eat food that are

1733
01:15:18.16 --> 01:15:22.68
awful to God and you can't offer God a riding carcass to eat.

1734
01:15:22.68 --> 01:15:24.40
OK.

1735
01:15:24.40 --> 01:15:25.92
There's nothing to have to do with like,

1736
01:15:25.92 --> 01:15:26.92
hey, we don't want to hurt things.

1737
01:15:26.92 --> 01:15:28.52
So there's all this carmic stuff.

1738
01:15:28.52 --> 01:15:32.40
If everybody likes to not make more karma for themselves,

1739
01:15:32.40 --> 01:15:33.40
good or bad.

1740
01:15:33.40 --> 01:15:34.36
See, that's what I'm saying.

1741
01:15:34.36 --> 01:15:36.56
Like, this is why this is why it gets more bizarre to me.

1742
01:15:36.56 --> 01:15:36.88
Yeah.

1743
01:15:36.88 --> 01:15:37.88
Because you try to get to the other side.

1744
01:15:37.88 --> 01:15:39.32
It's more karma for yourself.

1745
01:15:39.32 --> 01:15:41.92
See, that's the thing is with the amount of karma I had

1746
01:15:41.92 --> 01:15:42.80
over the end of it.

1747
01:15:42.80 --> 01:15:43.92
Heated for myself.

1748
01:15:43.92 --> 01:15:45.52
I was trying.

1749
01:15:45.52 --> 01:15:48.04
But this is where it gets even more fucked up and twisted.

1750
01:15:48.04 --> 01:15:51.76
Because you got me and my friends who were like recovering

1751
01:15:51.76 --> 01:15:54.68
skinheads, like a better way of putting it.

1752
01:15:54.68 --> 01:15:56.56
You know, dudes who used to go out and get in like,

1753
01:15:56.56 --> 01:15:58.72
you know, 20 fights in a night.

1754
01:15:58.72 --> 01:16:02.60
You know, put 19 people in ICU just because, you know,

1755
01:16:02.60 --> 01:16:04.36
just walking from the east side to the west side.

1756
01:16:04.36 --> 01:16:05.20
What you looking at?

1757
01:16:05.20 --> 01:16:06.44
Buh, you know, fuck you.

1758
01:16:06.44 --> 01:16:08.16
All night, just fucking wild.

1759
01:16:08.16 --> 01:16:11.04
And, you know, and then all that shit with pig man

1760
01:16:11.04 --> 01:16:13.76
and this and that and God knows how many other things.

1761
01:16:13.76 --> 01:16:17.24
How many bodies I found and came across

1762
01:16:17.24 --> 01:16:24.24
and, you know, how many, how much madness I had experienced, you know,

1763
01:16:25.44 --> 01:16:28.16
like we were talking about, you know, it's like sometimes, you know,

1764
01:16:28.16 --> 01:16:31.92
when you're dealing with life and death on a regular basis, you know,

1765
01:16:31.92 --> 01:16:34.88
sometimes you're like, you know, God, you start calling out to God.

1766
01:16:34.88 --> 01:16:36.36
You don't even know what the fuck God is.

1767
01:16:36.36 --> 01:16:40.28
And you're just like, God help me, God, you know, please, you know,

1768
01:16:40.28 --> 01:16:42.80
God makes help.

1769
01:16:42.80 --> 01:16:47.20
It's the call of desperation, you know.

1770
01:16:47.20 --> 01:16:53.20
And I would have never been into Christianity and this and that.

1771
01:16:53.20 --> 01:16:55.52
I just, it all just sounded like a bunch of bullshit to me.

1772
01:16:55.52 --> 01:17:00.20
And here I was actually hearing some things that made some sort of sense

1773
01:17:00.20 --> 01:17:04.76
to my teenage mind, you know, karma.

1774
01:17:04.76 --> 01:17:09.36
Woo, you know, all these other things that like we're like resonating with me,

1775
01:17:09.36 --> 01:17:13.16
you know, and it's like, I needed that shit, you know,

1776
01:17:13.16 --> 01:17:16.68
I needed some sort of guidance and had I not had something like that.

1777
01:17:16.68 --> 01:17:20.76
I mean, it could have been fucking Buddha, it could have been whatever, you know,

1778
01:17:20.76 --> 01:17:28.56
but I needed something that was greater than you need some kind of guidance and

1779
01:17:28.56 --> 01:17:29.56
your little favor.

1780
01:17:29.56 --> 01:17:30.68
I needed guidance, I needed a whole discipline.

1781
01:17:30.68 --> 01:17:31.36
I needed hope.

1782
01:17:31.36 --> 01:17:32.36
Oh, yeah.

1783
01:17:32.36 --> 01:17:37.000
You know, and when I started going out to their farm for a little while,

1784
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.36
like they were getting up at like five, 30 in the morning and meditating and

1785
01:17:41.36 --> 01:17:45.64
watching the sun come up and like it was like this whole, you know,

1786
01:17:45.64 --> 01:17:54.72
going from like being like hunted by the gangs in my neighborhood to that,

1787
01:17:54.72 --> 01:18:00.40
it was just like, I can't even really explain it.

1788
01:18:00.40 --> 01:18:06.68
It really, it was like, I don't know how to fucking put it, man.

1789
01:18:06.68 --> 01:18:08.64
It was just like it was like, here I am at peace.

1790
01:18:08.64 --> 01:18:09.64
Yeah, I was going to say it.

1791
01:18:09.64 --> 01:18:13.96
He sounds like people like Buddha first thought like, wow.

1792
01:18:13.96 --> 01:18:18.12
You know, so that, but then the more I was involved in it, the more I seen, you know,

1793
01:18:18.12 --> 01:18:24.12
that people in religions in general are typically a bunch of fucking hypocrites.

1794
01:18:24.12 --> 01:18:28.68
You know, you get a lot of people preaching a lot of shit that they don't all fucking

1795
01:18:28.68 --> 01:18:34.72
follow and all rules don't really fit all people.

1796
01:18:34.72 --> 01:18:40.000
You know, every human is different and not everybody can follow the same guidelines.

1797
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:46.000
And when the thing is started becoming just belief, what the fuck is belief anyway?

1798
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000
It's just what you choose to believe, you know, unless it's like this is real, you know,

1799
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.52
this is really cutting my face.

1800
01:18:52.52 --> 01:18:53.52
That's really blood.

1801
01:18:53.52 --> 01:18:58.96
This is, you know, I really have to eat food and breathe air.

1802
01:18:58.96 --> 01:19:01.76
Belief is just that, you know.

1803
01:19:01.76 --> 01:19:11.20
I still have, you know, my spiritual inclinations, I still believe in some sort of,

1804
01:19:11.20 --> 01:19:17.84
I don't like to say that word God anymore because I don't, I don't have that overview

1805
01:19:17.84 --> 01:19:21.40
that I know any fucking thing.

1806
01:19:21.40 --> 01:19:28.40
I just know, I know I got a lot of love in my heart for the people I care about.

1807
01:19:28.40 --> 01:19:36.08
And I know I want to try to do good things, you know, of done enough bad things.

1808
01:19:36.08 --> 01:19:42.88
I'd like to try to prevent some people from experiencing what I experienced and at the same

1809
01:19:42.88 --> 01:19:50.12
time I would like to share the great experiences that I had with people.

1810
01:19:50.12 --> 01:19:55.72
You know, well, one of the, one of the great experiences and one of the things, the great

1811
01:19:55.72 --> 01:19:58.36
things that you share to people is that, that out.

1812
01:19:58.36 --> 01:20:01.64
That outman will go to here, going back to the book, the age of core.

1813
01:20:01.64 --> 01:20:07.40
Some would call it one of the most, if not the most influential New York hardcore and crossover

1814
01:20:07.40 --> 01:20:09.12
albums.

1815
01:20:09.12 --> 01:20:16.72
It was recorded in mix in under 100 hours over a 14 day period January, February 1986,

1816
01:20:16.72 --> 01:20:22.68
at East Side Sound by Steve Remote and Chris Williams in our manager and so called producer,

1817
01:20:22.68 --> 01:20:23.56
but it was really Steve.

1818
01:20:23.56 --> 01:20:27.80
So 86 comes around and you guys put together the age of core.

1819
01:20:27.80 --> 01:20:31.48
Yeah, this is the one that got released on a big show.

1820
01:20:31.48 --> 01:20:32.72
Yeah, it was like the first hard work.

1821
01:20:32.72 --> 01:20:33.72
That's real fun.

1822
01:20:33.72 --> 01:20:39.76
Yeah, it was the, I probably one of the first hardcore records to ever be put out on a real

1823
01:20:39.76 --> 01:20:47.04
major label like something that wasn't like discord or slash records or something underground.

1824
01:20:47.04 --> 01:20:48.36
Yeah.

1825
01:20:48.36 --> 01:20:52.60
And now this is, you guys are, you guys are starting to get a big draw.

1826
01:20:52.60 --> 01:20:54.80
I mean, huge draw outside of New York City.

1827
01:20:54.80 --> 01:20:55.80
Yeah.

1828
01:20:55.80 --> 01:21:07.80
And we went on to play with many other metal bands around that time.

1829
01:21:07.80 --> 01:21:08.80
The whole crossover thing.

1830
01:21:08.80 --> 01:21:09.80
Right.

1831
01:21:09.80 --> 01:21:13.24
So yeah, for those of you that don't know crossover when he's talking about that, that's the

1832
01:21:13.24 --> 01:21:17.80
crossover from hardcore to metal.

1833
01:21:17.80 --> 01:21:18.80
And kind of combined.

1834
01:21:18.80 --> 01:21:24.60
It was really when the metal head started discovering hard when people like Metallica started

1835
01:21:24.60 --> 01:21:27.96
wearing GPH shirts and coming to see the Chrome eggs.

1836
01:21:27.96 --> 01:21:28.96
Yeah.

1837
01:21:28.96 --> 01:21:33.52
When people like anthrax started daring to come to CBGBs.

1838
01:21:33.52 --> 01:21:34.52
Yeah.

1839
01:21:34.52 --> 01:21:35.52
You know, and that's real quick.

1840
01:21:35.52 --> 01:21:37.32
But the hardcore bands started getting more metallic.

1841
01:21:37.32 --> 01:21:41.24
Well, yeah, because like metal head started shaving their heads and getting into hardcore.

1842
01:21:41.24 --> 01:21:44.40
Like the kid like yourself, like kids who had been listening to Van Hale and then they were

1843
01:21:44.40 --> 01:21:48.80
little who started getting into hardcore bands started getting more and then they're

1844
01:21:48.80 --> 01:21:49.80
not know.

1845
01:21:49.80 --> 01:21:50.80
We definitely.

1846
01:21:50.80 --> 01:21:51.80
Yeah.

1847
01:21:51.80 --> 01:21:52.80
I mean, they're not.

1848
01:21:52.80 --> 01:21:53.80
Yeah.

1849
01:21:53.80 --> 01:21:56.16
A lot of people tried to jump ship.

1850
01:21:56.16 --> 01:21:59.24
You know, I guess, you know, I don't, I see that kind of jokingly.

1851
01:21:59.24 --> 01:22:05.04
But I guess, you know, it seemed like there was more opportunity to actually make a living

1852
01:22:05.04 --> 01:22:11.24
bigger audience, you know, actual record deals, you know, Pantera.

1853
01:22:11.24 --> 01:22:12.24
Pantera.

1854
01:22:12.24 --> 01:22:13.24
Fucking great band.

1855
01:22:13.24 --> 01:22:14.24
Because Pantera.

1856
01:22:14.24 --> 01:22:19.36
I mean, one of my favorite bands probably, you know, dime bag, fucking love

1857
01:22:19.36 --> 01:22:20.36
that dude.

1858
01:22:20.36 --> 01:22:30.20
And one of the worst tragedies imaginable to a music is, well, the fuck got shot on

1859
01:22:30.20 --> 01:22:31.20
stage, right?

1860
01:22:31.20 --> 01:22:32.84
And by a fucking psychotic fan.

1861
01:22:32.84 --> 01:22:35.60
I mean, it's like, you know, but the fuck man.

1862
01:22:35.60 --> 01:22:37.60
Yeah, that was awful.

1863
01:22:37.60 --> 01:22:39.60
You know, yeah.

1864
01:22:39.60 --> 01:22:40.60
Yeah.

1865
01:22:40.60 --> 01:22:41.60
It's, yeah.

1866
01:22:41.60 --> 01:22:46.40
I mean, not to not to talk about not to get into, you know, the whole Kromag beef and

1867
01:22:46.40 --> 01:22:47.40
this and that.

1868
01:22:47.40 --> 01:22:54.56
One thing I will say is, you know, it really bothers me that dime bag died like that

1869
01:22:54.56 --> 01:22:58.12
and that they never, because I know they would have buried the hatchet by now and they would

1870
01:22:58.12 --> 01:23:02.28
have done an amazing reunion tour and they would, they would have just kicked this shit

1871
01:23:02.28 --> 01:23:04.000
out of everybody.

1872
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.92
And they'll never have that opportunity.

1873
01:23:05.92 --> 01:23:14.20
Now, because he was robbed from us and to know that my band or such a bunch of stubborn

1874
01:23:14.20 --> 01:23:21.16
immature, fucking old assholes that we could never actually embrace each other purely

1875
01:23:21.16 --> 01:23:28.36
based on what we did achieve together and how many fans would be so happy.

1876
01:23:28.36 --> 01:23:34.04
You know, because once once you're gone, you're gone and, you know, it's just very rare

1877
01:23:34.04 --> 01:23:40.96
that four or five people will have that chemistry for a moment in life.

1878
01:23:40.96 --> 01:23:46.44
So, you know, just based on that alone, it's pretty fucking sad and pathetic.

1879
01:23:46.44 --> 01:23:47.44
Yeah.

1880
01:23:47.44 --> 01:23:52.48
And it's weird run that you guys had because you guys, you guys, you guys were on the first

1881
01:23:52.48 --> 01:23:53.48
yeah.

1882
01:23:53.48 --> 01:23:54.48
I mean, yeah.

1883
01:23:54.48 --> 01:23:59.24
And when I, you know, when I remember you guys touring and I didn't see you on the

1884
01:23:59.24 --> 01:24:01.68
age of coral tour, because that wasn't really fast touring.

1885
01:24:01.68 --> 01:24:02.68
You went, yeah.

1886
01:24:02.68 --> 01:24:03.68
But I just did it.

1887
01:24:03.68 --> 01:24:04.68
Yeah.

1888
01:24:04.68 --> 01:24:05.68
And I'm particularly sure you see you.

1889
01:24:05.68 --> 01:24:09.56
But I saw you on the best wishes tour, which was the next album that came out.

1890
01:24:09.56 --> 01:24:10.80
You guys were big.

1891
01:24:10.80 --> 01:24:15.04
I mean, you guys were in a flu, just to kind of put it perspective for people, like,

1892
01:24:15.04 --> 01:24:20.32
I think the places where I saw you play, and this is kind of a national brand is the

1893
01:24:20.32 --> 01:24:21.48
house of blues.

1894
01:24:21.48 --> 01:24:23.48
If you've ever been to a house of blues, that's how you play.

1895
01:24:23.48 --> 01:24:24.48
That was like, that's the house of blues.

1896
01:24:24.48 --> 01:24:25.48
It's the place to play there.

1897
01:24:25.48 --> 01:24:26.48
I'm not.

1898
01:24:26.48 --> 01:24:27.48
Okay.

1899
01:24:27.48 --> 01:24:28.48
I didn't know you actually played there.

1900
01:24:28.48 --> 01:24:29.48
But like that kind of venue.

1901
01:24:29.48 --> 01:24:34.56
So that's, in my mind, you know, that's a band that, when you're playing places that

1902
01:24:34.56 --> 01:24:40.48
size, you can make a living, and if you keep going and stay consistent, you know, you

1903
01:24:40.48 --> 01:24:42.72
can do fairly well for yourself.

1904
01:24:42.72 --> 01:24:46.80
Now, this is the, so, you know, age of coral comes out.

1905
01:24:46.80 --> 01:24:47.80
You guys are popular.

1906
01:24:47.80 --> 01:24:49.64
You're, you're, you're getting after it.

1907
01:24:49.64 --> 01:24:52.48
You're, you're filling up places.

1908
01:24:52.48 --> 01:24:53.84
Best wishes, you're filling stuff.

1909
01:24:53.84 --> 01:24:54.84
You're headlining.

1910
01:24:54.84 --> 01:24:55.84
Best wishes.

1911
01:24:55.84 --> 01:24:57.12
But you're playing with motorhead, too, before.

1912
01:24:57.12 --> 01:24:58.12
Yeah.

1913
01:24:58.12 --> 01:24:59.48
You're supposed to play with black Sabbath one time.

1914
01:24:59.48 --> 01:25:00.48
Yeah.

1915
01:25:00.48 --> 01:25:04.20
By the way, that would actually be the ultimate show of all time for me.

1916
01:25:04.20 --> 01:25:07.12
I have to fucking agree from my favorite black Sabbath.

1917
01:25:07.12 --> 01:25:09.44
That's just, that's not it.

1918
01:25:09.44 --> 01:25:10.44
Yeah.

1919
01:25:10.44 --> 01:25:11.44
That would be the best.

1920
01:25:11.44 --> 01:25:12.44
Yeah.

1921
01:25:12.44 --> 01:25:13.44
Black Sabbath to show up.

1922
01:25:13.44 --> 01:25:14.44
Yeah.

1923
01:25:14.44 --> 01:25:15.44
Yeah.

1924
01:25:15.44 --> 01:25:16.44
There were some issues.

1925
01:25:16.44 --> 01:25:17.44
Yeah.

1926
01:25:17.44 --> 01:25:18.44
Yeah.

1927
01:25:18.44 --> 01:25:19.44
That, yeah.

1928
01:25:19.44 --> 01:25:23.04
And you have the flyer, the flyer, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.

1929
01:25:23.04 --> 01:25:24.04
Dude.

1930
01:25:24.04 --> 01:25:26.44
You know, I made it on a flyer with black Sabbath motorhead.

1931
01:25:26.44 --> 01:25:29.16
You know, I was looking that out.

1932
01:25:29.16 --> 01:25:31.20
But here's the crazy thing.

1933
01:25:31.20 --> 01:25:32.64
I was reading the book.

1934
01:25:32.64 --> 01:25:33.92
I couldn't believe this.

1935
01:25:33.92 --> 01:25:35.92
You come home from those tours.

1936
01:25:35.92 --> 01:25:36.92
Yeah.

1937
01:25:36.92 --> 01:25:38.28
And you have no money.

1938
01:25:38.28 --> 01:25:39.28
Yeah.

1939
01:25:39.28 --> 01:25:40.60
Yeah.

1940
01:25:40.60 --> 01:25:41.60
And you hear this.

1941
01:25:41.60 --> 01:25:43.48
This is kind of like a rock and roll myth, right?

1942
01:25:43.48 --> 01:25:47.04
Oh, the guy signs the contract, the producer.

1943
01:25:47.04 --> 01:25:50.48
And I watched a bunch of programs about this.

1944
01:25:50.48 --> 01:25:53.16
And what the, what the record companies do is they say, hey, look, we're going to give

1945
01:25:53.16 --> 01:25:55.56
you a $100,000 advance for your next album.

1946
01:25:55.56 --> 01:25:56.56
And then you go awesome.

1947
01:25:56.56 --> 01:25:58.16
So they give you a hundred grand.

1948
01:25:58.16 --> 01:26:02.84
And you start spending it and then they back charge you for your studio time and the

1949
01:26:02.84 --> 01:26:03.84
promotion.

1950
01:26:03.84 --> 01:26:07.48
And you know, literally at the end, you haven't even gone on tour.

1951
01:26:07.48 --> 01:26:08.48
You owe them $20,000.

1952
01:26:08.48 --> 01:26:09.48
$20,000.

1953
01:26:09.48 --> 01:26:10.48
You're working to pay it off.

1954
01:26:10.48 --> 01:26:11.48
Yeah.

1955
01:26:11.48 --> 01:26:13.20
They lent you this money with interest.

1956
01:26:13.20 --> 01:26:15.84
And so that's the kind of shit that was happening with you.

1957
01:26:15.84 --> 01:26:18.68
And you come back off these tours, your famous.

1958
01:26:18.68 --> 01:26:24.56
Because also at this time, now that I think about it, you and the Chrome ads, you guys

1959
01:26:24.56 --> 01:26:26.60
were like on the cover of like the metal magazines.

1960
01:26:26.60 --> 01:26:29.60
All those stupid metal magazines, man.

1961
01:26:29.60 --> 01:26:32.60
You'd be like Skid Row on one page and awesome.

1962
01:26:32.60 --> 01:26:33.60
Yeah.

1963
01:26:33.60 --> 01:26:34.60
I thought fuck.

1964
01:26:34.60 --> 01:26:35.60
Yeah.

1965
01:26:35.60 --> 01:26:36.60
I see on one page me on the next.

1966
01:26:36.60 --> 01:26:37.60
Yeah.

1967
01:26:37.60 --> 01:26:38.60
So you were there.

1968
01:26:38.60 --> 01:26:39.60
I mean, yeah.

1969
01:26:39.60 --> 01:26:40.60
We were on the cuss.

1970
01:26:40.60 --> 01:26:42.60
We were all right about to break it.

1971
01:26:42.60 --> 01:26:43.60
You know.

1972
01:26:43.60 --> 01:26:45.60
And you were still broke.

1973
01:26:45.60 --> 01:26:46.60
You were coming up with those tours.

1974
01:26:46.60 --> 01:26:48.60
It still would be living on the streets.

1975
01:26:48.60 --> 01:26:53.60
I would, I would be coming off those tours and trying to figure out where I was staying

1976
01:26:53.60 --> 01:26:56.60
or I'd be showing up at my grandma's house.

1977
01:26:56.60 --> 01:27:01.80
You know, or I'd be like, you know, yeah, we got pretty fucked.

1978
01:27:01.80 --> 01:27:05.80
You know, you don't know what you don't know.

1979
01:27:05.80 --> 01:27:11.48
You know, that's so it's like when you're a kid and you ain't got no guidance, nobody

1980
01:27:11.48 --> 01:27:12.48
looking out for you.

1981
01:27:12.48 --> 01:27:13.98
You know, you make a lot of mistakes.

1982
01:27:13.98 --> 01:27:16.08
And also back then, they had a much better monopoly.

1983
01:27:16.08 --> 01:27:17.08
Yeah, they're completely inferior.

1984
01:27:17.08 --> 01:27:18.08
They're nowadays.

1985
01:27:18.08 --> 01:27:20.08
You can say, oh, you know what?

1986
01:27:20.08 --> 01:27:21.08
I'll just make my own record.

1987
01:27:21.08 --> 01:27:25.60
And I'll be able to distribute it through the internet and social media all the

1988
01:27:25.60 --> 01:27:26.60
other stuff.

1989
01:27:26.60 --> 01:27:29.80
That would have been helpful in those days as far as, you know,

1990
01:27:29.80 --> 01:27:37.44
but, you know, I think that the internet and everything is also really kind of

1991
01:27:37.44 --> 01:27:43.04
fuck music up because it's like people don't have to have any lineage or any connection

1992
01:27:43.04 --> 01:27:44.04
to their roots anymore.

1993
01:27:44.04 --> 01:27:47.28
It's like people who don't know anything can just Google it and cut it and paste it

1994
01:27:47.28 --> 01:27:48.28
and call it their own.

1995
01:27:48.28 --> 01:27:51.08
And the next thing you know, they're an artist and it's like, no, you're not a fucking

1996
01:27:51.08 --> 01:27:52.08
artist.

1997
01:27:52.08 --> 01:27:54.92
You're a fucking cut and paste and motherfucker who hasn't ever actually experienced

1998
01:27:54.92 --> 01:27:55.92
a fucking thing.

1999
01:27:55.92 --> 01:27:58.48
And you don't even know the history of what you're imitating.

2000
01:27:58.48 --> 01:28:00.40
You just know that you're into it right now.

2001
01:28:00.40 --> 01:28:01.84
So you're imitating it right now.

2002
01:28:01.84 --> 01:28:08.56
The other crazy thing is, you know, it was hard to get like these records when I was

2003
01:28:08.56 --> 01:28:09.56
a kid.

2004
01:28:09.56 --> 01:28:10.40
Yeah, you had to know.

2005
01:28:10.40 --> 01:28:11.40
You couldn't order them.

2006
01:28:11.40 --> 01:28:16.20
You had to like get somebody that was going to go to New York and hey, if they have

2007
01:28:16.20 --> 01:28:17.20
this album, can you pick it up?

2008
01:28:17.20 --> 01:28:18.56
Where you go to Blika Bobbs and yeah.

2009
01:28:18.56 --> 01:28:19.56
Yeah, you go to Blika.

2010
01:28:19.56 --> 01:28:21.04
And it was like that.

2011
01:28:21.04 --> 01:28:25.40
You couldn't just, but nowadays, you can, if you say, oh, the Chrome Mags are cool because

2012
01:28:25.40 --> 01:28:26.40
I heard a song.

2013
01:28:26.40 --> 01:28:30.08
You put them into Google, you get Chrome Mags, you get every other band that's been

2014
01:28:30.08 --> 01:28:32.96
related to them, you get bounce, it sounds like them and you can just download them all

2015
01:28:32.96 --> 01:28:34.32
immediately if it's no factor.

2016
01:28:34.32 --> 01:28:35.76
It is kind of crazy.

2017
01:28:35.76 --> 01:28:42.36
That's why for me, like, how many record total record albums I had and I loved music,

2018
01:28:42.36 --> 01:28:47.44
I probably had like 80 records, right?

2019
01:28:47.44 --> 01:28:48.76
80 records.

2020
01:28:48.76 --> 01:28:51.12
All my computer right now, all my phone.

2021
01:28:51.12 --> 01:28:55.28
I probably got 10,000 records, no, Kaka all kinds of songs, right?

2022
01:28:55.28 --> 01:28:58.64
Every band that's ever existed, I got them on my phone.

2023
01:28:58.64 --> 01:29:04.92
And you would shit if you saw my fucking album, you would shit.

2024
01:29:04.92 --> 01:29:10.84
You would fucking be like a kid in the candy store man, you're fucking because I got everything

2025
01:29:10.84 --> 01:29:14.40
from back then I got all, I got like motorhead test pressings.

2026
01:29:14.40 --> 01:29:18.04
I got like, you're one of those guys because I get test pressings.

2027
01:29:18.04 --> 01:29:23.48
I was watching some video with Rollins, because you know Rollins has, I do get my first

2028
01:29:23.48 --> 01:29:24.48
single.

2029
01:29:24.48 --> 01:29:29.92
I think he might have one of the most epic record clips.

2030
01:29:29.92 --> 01:29:31.92
He likes weird stuff.

2031
01:29:31.92 --> 01:29:36.28
He likes stuff that like, I wouldn't want it, but he's got, you know, first pressing test

2032
01:29:36.28 --> 01:29:37.28
pressing.

2033
01:29:37.28 --> 01:29:38.28
He's a freak.

2034
01:29:38.28 --> 01:29:39.28
Yeah.

2035
01:29:39.28 --> 01:29:40.88
And he's got money too.

2036
01:29:40.88 --> 01:29:41.88
Yeah, he's a good dude.

2037
01:29:41.88 --> 01:29:42.88
Yeah, yeah.

2038
01:29:42.88 --> 01:29:44.36
Some people people.

2039
01:29:44.36 --> 01:29:47.84
You end up trying to, trying to sue a little bit, I think you try to sue the record

2040
01:29:47.84 --> 01:29:48.84
company or something.

2041
01:29:48.84 --> 01:29:50.32
You end up just going into legal costs.

2042
01:29:50.32 --> 01:29:54.28
But we were trying to, because we were trying desperately to get off of our record

2043
01:29:54.28 --> 01:29:59.60
label and get away from our management because we got to a certain point where we were

2044
01:29:59.60 --> 01:30:06.04
just on the verge of blowing up and profile was still treating us like chumps.

2045
01:30:06.04 --> 01:30:07.20
We weren't getting no money.

2046
01:30:07.20 --> 01:30:08.20
We weren't getting anything.

2047
01:30:08.20 --> 01:30:10.92
We were getting treated like fucking dog shit.

2048
01:30:10.92 --> 01:30:15.60
And someone who was working at Electra was interested in signing us.

2049
01:30:15.60 --> 01:30:17.48
So we were like, Electra, Metallica.

2050
01:30:17.48 --> 01:30:18.88
Here's our fucking shot.

2051
01:30:18.88 --> 01:30:19.88
So we like got to do it.

2052
01:30:19.88 --> 01:30:22.60
His profile was like, oh, metal is right?

2053
01:30:22.60 --> 01:30:24.24
No, profile was actually a hip-hop.

2054
01:30:24.24 --> 01:30:29.12
So they did with us was really kind of out there out there because they had, you know,

2055
01:30:29.12 --> 01:30:30.12
they're big bands.

2056
01:30:30.12 --> 01:30:31.12
Like, century media.

2057
01:30:31.12 --> 01:30:35.52
That's came after no, profile was big for a run DMC.

2058
01:30:35.52 --> 01:30:39.04
That was who they're, and then like, Rob base.

2059
01:30:39.04 --> 01:30:42.36
It takes two, that was like there was big.

2060
01:30:42.36 --> 01:30:43.68
That was their hits.

2061
01:30:43.68 --> 01:30:45.32
Run DMC was their main shit.

2062
01:30:45.32 --> 01:30:47.16
Speaking of crossover.

2063
01:30:47.16 --> 01:30:48.16
Run DMC.

2064
01:30:48.16 --> 01:30:49.16
Yeah.

2065
01:30:49.16 --> 01:30:50.16
They brought the metal.

2066
01:30:50.16 --> 01:30:51.16
They got a riff.

2067
01:30:51.16 --> 01:30:53.60
I mean, you know, those guys were great, man.

2068
01:30:53.60 --> 01:30:54.60
Yeah, that was pretty cool.

2069
01:30:54.60 --> 01:30:57.04
I saw them play many times back in the day.

2070
01:30:57.04 --> 01:31:00.60
I remember seeing them with the Beastie Boys at the Garden and that, that was a fucking great

2071
01:31:00.60 --> 01:31:01.60
show.

2072
01:31:01.60 --> 01:31:02.60
It's fun, man.

2073
01:31:02.60 --> 01:31:07.60
It's like all the Beastie Boys brought all the white kids and run DMC, brought all the

2074
01:31:07.60 --> 01:31:10.60
black kids and the black kids who just walking around, robbing all the white ladies.

2075
01:31:10.60 --> 01:31:13.60
I've never been fucking laughing like fucking take off.

2076
01:31:13.60 --> 01:31:16.60
Like watching people just get yoked in the fucking aisles.

2077
01:31:16.60 --> 01:31:18.60
I like this shit as hilarious.

2078
01:31:18.60 --> 01:31:21.60
Yeah, that was funny.

2079
01:31:21.60 --> 01:31:26.24
So you're trying to get off that label and trying to get on to a lecture at damn.

2080
01:31:26.24 --> 01:31:27.24
Because a lecture was huge.

2081
01:31:27.24 --> 01:31:31.84
Yeah, yeah, that would have been a good move for us, but profile didn't like us and

2082
01:31:31.84 --> 01:31:38.96
they would have rather taken, you know, they couldn't offer them enough money to give

2083
01:31:38.96 --> 01:31:39.96
us our freedom.

2084
01:31:39.96 --> 01:31:42.60
They were like, fuck these days.

2085
01:31:42.60 --> 01:31:44.60
Yeah, we had some issues with some of them.

2086
01:31:44.60 --> 01:31:46.32
He had people there.

2087
01:31:46.32 --> 01:31:51.28
And then you end up with alpha omega.

2088
01:31:51.28 --> 01:31:52.28
Yeah.

2089
01:31:52.28 --> 01:31:54.28
And by the way, I didn't say this, but you sang on Best Wishes.

2090
01:31:54.28 --> 01:31:57.28
Yeah, I sang on like half the album.

2091
01:31:57.28 --> 01:31:58.28
Oh, God.

2092
01:31:58.28 --> 01:32:01.28
And then me and John both sang on alpha omega.

2093
01:32:01.28 --> 01:32:06.28
And I got to read this from the book because I got to kick out of it.

2094
01:32:06.28 --> 01:32:07.28
Oh, boy.

2095
01:32:07.28 --> 01:32:09.28
There he goes back to the book.

2096
01:32:09.28 --> 01:32:14.28
You know how you can always tell when a heavy band is starting to lose their edge when

2097
01:32:14.28 --> 01:32:17.28
they start using a fucking keyboard?

2098
01:32:17.28 --> 01:32:19.28
Yeah, we did that.

2099
01:32:19.28 --> 01:32:27.92
All right, to be fair, I was eating a lot of mushrooms that they were quitting session.

2100
01:32:27.92 --> 01:32:32.000
So like things sounded a little bit different to me and they were sounding, the keyboard

2101
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
sounded cool, man.

2102
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:40.96
I was eating all kinds of mushrooms and chicken mushroom tea and I was like, yeah, that's

2103
01:32:40.96 --> 01:32:41.96
it sounds cool.

2104
01:32:41.96 --> 01:32:44.84
Yeah, I have rolled with that, you know.

2105
01:32:44.84 --> 01:32:48.20
But see, at least I can look back and laugh at myself.

2106
01:32:48.20 --> 01:32:52.24
You know, it's like if you can't fucking laugh at yourself, man, you're an asshole.

2107
01:32:52.24 --> 01:32:55.20
And some other, I think I might have breeze through it, but there's another point where

2108
01:32:55.20 --> 01:32:59.92
you're talking about how spinal tapish, like, all this, I mean, even that spinal tapish, right?

2109
01:32:59.92 --> 01:33:01.92
We started to venture out.

2110
01:33:01.92 --> 01:33:02.92
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?

2111
01:33:02.92 --> 01:33:04.92
Yeah, you know, it's the stone hinge.

2112
01:33:04.92 --> 01:33:05.92
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2113
01:33:05.92 --> 01:33:06.92
Yeah.

2114
01:33:06.92 --> 01:33:10.88
So, and did you want to hear something really fucking funny?

2115
01:33:10.88 --> 01:33:16.84
I mean, me and Doug watched spinal tap with John one time, just just to show you a bit

2116
01:33:16.84 --> 01:33:17.84
about his intellect.

2117
01:33:17.84 --> 01:33:21.32
I, we're watching about halfway through that movie.

2118
01:33:21.32 --> 01:33:27.56
John turns to me and Doug goes, yo, man, these guys suck.

2119
01:33:27.56 --> 01:33:28.96
I've never even heard of them.

2120
01:33:28.96 --> 01:33:30.96
Why did they make a movie about them?

2121
01:33:30.96 --> 01:33:35.76
And then Doug just look at each other, like, this motherfucking thing, this is a real

2122
01:33:35.76 --> 01:33:36.76
documentary.

2123
01:33:36.76 --> 01:33:38.76
Oh, my fucking, anyway.

2124
01:33:38.76 --> 01:33:39.76
Sorry, I had it.

2125
01:33:39.76 --> 01:33:44.92
Hey, you know what, I've seen spinal tap twice.

2126
01:33:44.92 --> 01:33:45.92
Live.

2127
01:33:45.92 --> 01:33:46.92
I saw them once.

2128
01:33:46.92 --> 01:33:47.92
Yeah, yeah.

2129
01:33:47.92 --> 01:33:48.92
I have a spinal tap, like that.

2130
01:33:48.92 --> 01:33:49.92
Yeah, that's what's up.

2131
01:33:49.92 --> 01:33:54.60
I brought my wife and you know what, they play big bottoms, you know, they're all

2132
01:33:54.60 --> 01:33:55.60
played bass.

2133
01:33:55.60 --> 01:33:56.60
Yeah, yeah.

2134
01:33:56.60 --> 01:33:57.60
Yeah, yeah.

2135
01:33:57.60 --> 01:33:58.60
That's what it was.

2136
01:33:58.60 --> 01:34:00.60
That was a fucking brilliant, fucking movie.

2137
01:34:00.60 --> 01:34:04.96
No, but I remember like being in those clothes where you're trying to find the

2138
01:34:04.96 --> 01:34:05.96
stage, you're walking around.

2139
01:34:05.96 --> 01:34:06.96
You're just like, all right, Cleveland.

2140
01:34:06.96 --> 01:34:07.96
All right, Cleveland.

2141
01:34:07.96 --> 01:34:09.96
You're like fucking walking around.

2142
01:34:09.96 --> 01:34:10.96
You wind up outside the glove.

2143
01:34:10.96 --> 01:34:12.96
You're like, we're fucking the major.

2144
01:34:12.96 --> 01:34:14.96
Yeah.

2145
01:34:14.96 --> 01:34:18.68
Now, you're still struggling.

2146
01:34:18.68 --> 01:34:19.68
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2147
01:34:19.68 --> 01:34:20.68
Yeah, yeah.

2148
01:34:20.68 --> 01:34:21.68
Yeah, yeah.

2149
01:34:21.68 --> 01:34:22.68
Yeah, yeah.

2150
01:34:22.68 --> 01:34:23.68
Yeah, yeah.

2151
01:34:23.68 --> 01:34:24.68
Yeah, yeah.

2152
01:34:24.68 --> 01:34:25.68
Yeah, yeah.

2153
01:34:25.68 --> 01:34:26.68
Yeah, yeah.

2154
01:34:26.68 --> 01:34:27.68
Yeah, yeah.

2155
01:34:27.68 --> 01:34:28.68
Yeah, yeah.

2156
01:34:28.68 --> 01:34:29.68
Yeah, yeah.

2157
01:34:29.68 --> 01:34:30.68
Yeah, yeah.

2158
01:34:30.68 --> 01:34:33.92
Before I get into this next chapter, I'm telling you that I had to lose a lot

2159
01:34:33.92 --> 01:34:38.04
of stuff from this era, because I have kids now, and I don't want them to know exactly

2160
01:34:38.04 --> 01:34:43.000
how insane things got, or to think I'm a worse piece of shit than they already will

2161
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.56
or do.

2162
01:34:44.56 --> 01:34:48.52
But again, this is proof that you can plummet to the bottom of the worst depths of hell

2163
01:34:48.52 --> 01:34:51.60
and still come back and try to become a better person.

2164
01:34:51.60 --> 01:34:57.16
There was enough filth, drugs, or geez, violence, and crime during this period, to write

2165
01:34:57.16 --> 01:34:59.52
a book about nothing else.

2166
01:34:59.52 --> 01:35:05.08
As insane as it was, and as much fun as I thought I was having, deep down I was looking

2167
01:35:05.08 --> 01:35:06.80
for a way out.

2168
01:35:06.80 --> 01:35:09.76
I think that's why I took everything to such an extreme.

2169
01:35:09.76 --> 01:35:13.88
I don't think I cared if I lived.

2170
01:35:13.88 --> 01:35:16.76
There were times I don't think I wanted to.

2171
01:35:16.76 --> 01:35:20.20
I'm not proud looking back on it now.

2172
01:35:20.20 --> 01:35:28.84
If anything, I'm surprised I survived.

2173
01:35:28.84 --> 01:35:29.84
Heavy.

2174
01:35:29.84 --> 01:35:32.24
It's fucked up here and you read that shit, bro.

2175
01:35:32.24 --> 01:35:35.76
It makes me go up.

2176
01:35:35.76 --> 01:35:41.64
But yeah, man, it's true.

2177
01:35:41.64 --> 01:35:51.44
I've seen some of my friends that they start to get the same outlook.

2178
01:35:51.44 --> 01:36:00.56
They start doing shit that is not high survival rate activities.

2179
01:36:00.56 --> 01:36:06.28
It's like they're walking that line of, you know, what's kind of like you want to die,

2180
01:36:06.28 --> 01:36:10.28
but you're not going to take the pussy route and kill yourself.

2181
01:36:10.28 --> 01:36:16.28
So you're just going to do everything you can to kill yourself without actually putting

2182
01:36:16.28 --> 01:36:17.52
a rope around your neck.

2183
01:36:17.52 --> 01:36:20.92
So instead of putting a rope around your neck, you put a rope around your arm and stick

2184
01:36:20.92 --> 01:36:29.80
a fucking needle in it or smoke dust until the world is just a fucking illusion.

2185
01:36:29.80 --> 01:36:34.48
I'm going to read this right here because this is, you know, here you go back to the book.

2186
01:36:34.48 --> 01:36:36.68
At one point, I was broke a shit.

2187
01:36:36.68 --> 01:36:41.28
This is after you have three albums signed by a major record contract torn all over the

2188
01:36:41.28 --> 01:36:44.12
world, played with motorhead on tour.

2189
01:36:44.12 --> 01:36:45.56
Here we go back to the book.

2190
01:36:45.56 --> 01:36:51.08
At one point, I was broke a shit and I got busted shoplifting food at a supermarket.

2191
01:36:51.08 --> 01:36:52.52
I didn't have any ID.

2192
01:36:52.52 --> 01:36:56.48
So the kids I was with ran back to the house and came back with three of my CD covers

2193
01:36:56.48 --> 01:36:57.48
as ID.

2194
01:36:57.48 --> 01:37:02.44
I was sitting in this holding area in the back of the store and the store cops were looking

2195
01:37:02.44 --> 01:37:03.44
at me all confused.

2196
01:37:03.44 --> 01:37:05.20
They were like, this is your ID.

2197
01:37:05.20 --> 01:37:09.12
I was holding up pictures from the age of coral best wishes in Alpho, Maga and I was

2198
01:37:09.12 --> 01:37:11.68
like, see, look at the picture and look at my tattoos.

2199
01:37:11.68 --> 01:37:12.92
This is me.

2200
01:37:12.92 --> 01:37:14.44
They were like, you're kidding, right?

2201
01:37:14.44 --> 01:37:15.76
This is all the ID you got.

2202
01:37:15.76 --> 01:37:16.76
Yeah.

2203
01:37:16.76 --> 01:37:19.76
That's, yeah, I didn't even have a fuck.

2204
01:37:19.76 --> 01:37:22.88
I had no ID, I had nothing to do.

2205
01:37:22.88 --> 01:37:23.88
You know what else?

2206
01:37:23.88 --> 01:37:28.12
I just realized that I completely breased over is like I'm saying that you had this record,

2207
01:37:28.12 --> 01:37:29.60
you had this record, you had this record, you had this record, you had this record, you're

2208
01:37:29.60 --> 01:37:31.12
also a sick basis.

2209
01:37:31.12 --> 01:37:33.52
I mean, like an unbelievable basis.

2210
01:37:33.52 --> 01:37:37.12
You know, like, like, see, you had this incredible musical talent you played drums, too,

2211
01:37:37.12 --> 01:37:41.16
but I mean, your bass playing is a better drummer.

2212
01:37:41.16 --> 01:37:43.84
But that's, well, that's good.

2213
01:37:43.84 --> 01:37:46.48
But your bass playing is sick.

2214
01:37:46.48 --> 01:37:50.68
So you had all this talent and you had records and you had fans and you had all the

2215
01:37:50.68 --> 01:37:53.84
shit and you're still down in the down in the door.

2216
01:37:53.84 --> 01:37:54.84
Shoplifting to eat.

2217
01:37:54.84 --> 01:37:55.84
Shoplifting.

2218
01:37:55.84 --> 01:37:57.52
Fucking smoke and ice.

2219
01:37:57.52 --> 01:37:58.52
Dude.

2220
01:37:58.52 --> 01:38:01.52
Hey, man, you know it could have been worse, man.

2221
01:38:01.52 --> 01:38:03.92
I mean, look at fucking people like Jocco Pistores.

2222
01:38:03.92 --> 01:38:07.44
I mean, that motherfucker was like the most basis.

2223
01:38:07.44 --> 01:38:13.000
Yeah, like the, and Jimmy Hendrix, you know, he was the Jimmy Hendrix of bass and

2224
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000
look at Jimmy and him and it's like, you know, you can have all that talent and if you're,

2225
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:22.92
you know, if you're suffering on the inside, man, you know, mean fucking Jocco, there's

2226
01:38:22.92 --> 01:38:23.92
another tragedy.

2227
01:38:23.92 --> 01:38:28.28
motherfucker got beat to death by a bouncer, you know, who didn't know who he was.

2228
01:38:28.28 --> 01:38:31.08
This is not this Jocco, this is, this is, this is, this is the place.

2229
01:38:31.08 --> 01:38:32.08
Jocco Pistores.

2230
01:38:32.08 --> 01:38:36.60
He actually got tried to get up on stage on a centanish show because he was friends

2231
01:38:36.60 --> 01:38:40.56
with centan and he tried to get up on the stage and he was so fucking messy at the time

2232
01:38:40.56 --> 01:38:44.36
that nobody could recognize him and the bouncer's threw him out and he kept being

2233
01:38:44.36 --> 01:38:47.16
belligerent and he beat him to death.

2234
01:38:47.16 --> 01:38:50.40
You know, so it's like you can have all the talent in the world, but you know, it's

2235
01:38:50.40 --> 01:38:55.08
just, it's sad because really the people who are have that gift usually are people who

2236
01:38:55.08 --> 01:38:56.52
are really emotionally.

2237
01:38:56.52 --> 01:39:00.20
Well, that's why they have that gift because there's a fucking emotional.

2238
01:39:00.20 --> 01:39:08.64
You know, I think, you know, that can really become destructive if you don't have a positive

2239
01:39:08.64 --> 01:39:09.64
place.

2240
01:39:09.64 --> 01:39:13.78
Like if you're really, the only times in my life where I haven't been all fucked up on

2241
01:39:13.78 --> 01:39:20.68
drugs was when I had something constructive to do something that gave me a purpose.

2242
01:39:20.68 --> 01:39:31.04
And when you have that creative emotional self destructive thing in you because it really

2243
01:39:31.04 --> 01:39:34.60
can become self destructive if you don't have a place to put it.

2244
01:39:34.60 --> 01:39:37.96
I mean, shit man, if you wouldn't have fucking gone into the military, God knows what

2245
01:39:37.96 --> 01:39:40.40
the fuck you would have done with that intensity.

2246
01:39:40.40 --> 01:39:42.76
No, the military, I've talked about it.

2247
01:39:42.76 --> 01:39:44.16
You know, I mean, it's like you don't.

2248
01:39:44.16 --> 01:39:45.16
It's a beautiful thing.

2249
01:39:45.16 --> 01:39:46.16
It's a beautiful thing for me.

2250
01:39:46.16 --> 01:39:48.64
Yeah, I mean, it probably would have been for me too.

2251
01:39:48.64 --> 01:39:49.64
I just wound up.

2252
01:39:49.64 --> 01:39:53.56
But you know, instead, I wanted to be soundtrack to you.

2253
01:39:53.56 --> 01:39:59.12
But a lot of fighters, you know, you know, you have see fighters and stuff and a lot of

2254
01:39:59.12 --> 01:40:01.40
those guys have a rough time, you know, absolutely.

2255
01:40:01.40 --> 01:40:09.000
Because it's hard to be that type of an intense person and to go to such extreme emotional

2256
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.60
dumps because, you know, one second, you're just a tough guy on the street.

2257
01:40:14.60 --> 01:40:17.88
The next second, you're a tough guy in front of fucking thousands of people and there's

2258
01:40:17.88 --> 01:40:24.12
lights flashing everywhere, you know, and then, you know, and then some people, it's

2259
01:40:24.12 --> 01:40:27.96
like your career is done and you're still that tough guy who still will fuck shit up,

2260
01:40:27.96 --> 01:40:32.20
but nobody gives a fuck and now if you fuck somebody up, you're going to fucking jail.

2261
01:40:32.20 --> 01:40:37.32
You know, and it's like, you know, and drugs become an easy way to deal with fame and

2262
01:40:37.32 --> 01:40:42.24
the confusion of popularity and the depression.

2263
01:40:42.24 --> 01:40:50.48
So, a heavy thing to go from to the silence of your room and your mind.

2264
01:40:50.48 --> 01:40:54.96
There's a buddy of mine plays in a band called Slightly Stupid and there's actually

2265
01:40:54.96 --> 01:41:00.52
a big band and they play in front, they're from San Diego and one of the guys and we're

2266
01:41:00.52 --> 01:41:04.68
just, you know, he's got a little kid, just normal guy, but he plays in a slightly stupid

2267
01:41:04.68 --> 01:41:09.56
and he was, you know, they just got back from tour and, you know, I just said something

2268
01:41:09.56 --> 01:41:10.56
to him, you know, how was it?

2269
01:41:10.56 --> 01:41:15.000
And he goes, man, it just never gets old, you know, get up in front of 10,000 people that

2270
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.48
are singing your songs, man.

2271
01:41:16.48 --> 01:41:19.60
He said it's just like unbelievable.

2272
01:41:19.60 --> 01:41:24.92
I tell you, man, I haven't been in tour on tour in a really long time and I'm last time

2273
01:41:24.92 --> 01:41:28.32
I gigged out.

2274
01:41:28.32 --> 01:41:37.04
I think the last time I did a tour was like 2011 or 2012 and then a lot of shit went

2275
01:41:37.04 --> 01:41:45.96
to South in my life, go figure and I needed time to pull myself back up and get my

2276
01:41:45.96 --> 01:41:48.16
shit back together.

2277
01:41:48.16 --> 01:41:55.44
I'm going on tour in about nine days, I'll be playing in Berlin first, I'm gonna be playing

2278
01:41:55.44 --> 01:42:02.28
a bunch of shows in Germany, I'll be playing in Venice and Italy and I'll be playing in Switzerland,

2279
01:42:02.28 --> 01:42:04.36
I believe in Belgium and the UK.

2280
01:42:04.36 --> 01:42:12.52
I'm gonna have about 12 or 13 shows in 13 or 14 days, I'm really, really looking forward

2281
01:42:12.52 --> 01:42:16.12
to this.

2282
01:42:16.12 --> 01:42:21.56
I'm not looking forward to driving five, six hour drives, I'm not looking forward to not

2283
01:42:21.56 --> 01:42:26.20
sleeping in my bed, I'm not looking forward to not waking up next to my wife, I'm not

2284
01:42:26.20 --> 01:42:33.000
looking forward to all that shit but I am really fucking looking forward to doing my thing

2285
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.04
again.

2286
01:42:35.04 --> 01:42:40.64
I got so involved with jujitsu and teaching jujitsu and stuff that music actually started

2287
01:42:40.64 --> 01:42:46.36
to take kind of a back seat, especially when I had my kids and I really couldn't tour

2288
01:42:46.36 --> 01:42:49.32
and stuff anymore.

2289
01:42:49.32 --> 01:42:54.12
While I was a choice I made, I could have done whatever the fuck I wanted but I chose

2290
01:42:54.12 --> 01:42:56.52
to be there for my kids.

2291
01:42:56.52 --> 01:43:06.16
Now they're older and so on and life is as made this possible to do again, I can't wait

2292
01:43:06.16 --> 01:43:09.80
man.

2293
01:43:09.80 --> 01:43:18.56
This affecting people the way you do with music, it's a, you make a connection, you know,

2294
01:43:18.56 --> 01:43:22.08
you know, look man, I'm sitting across from you now because we're fucking out of my

2295
01:43:22.08 --> 01:43:27.36
minute, 30 fucking years ago with that fucking tell you, it's bad ass, you know.

2296
01:43:27.36 --> 01:43:31.12
It's good.

2297
01:43:31.12 --> 01:43:37.60
You're going back to book here, you're at that point, you know, this is the same time period

2298
01:43:37.60 --> 01:43:44.40
where you're getting arrested for shoplifting and here we go, I was in a state of depression

2299
01:43:44.40 --> 01:43:47.56
and the drugs helped me stay in it.

2300
01:43:47.56 --> 01:43:51.80
I was trying to get better as far as wanting to get off drugs at least half the time and

2301
01:43:51.80 --> 01:43:57.28
I would for a few days or a week or so here or there but I was just too depressed and one

2302
01:43:57.28 --> 01:44:03.84
thing would lead to another then back into the abyss, the death spiral into emptiness,

2303
01:44:03.84 --> 01:44:07.08
nothing and nowhereness.

2304
01:44:07.08 --> 01:44:12.16
Of course I was all into Alice and chains and nine inch nails and all that fucking depressed

2305
01:44:12.16 --> 01:44:21.28
drug music but even as fucked up as I was, there was this wheat grass juice stand on

2306
01:44:21.28 --> 01:44:25.48
mission and I'd still make sure to go get a shot of wheat grass juice every day because

2307
01:44:25.48 --> 01:44:31.64
I figured hey at least wheat grass juice is equal to eating tons of vegetables.

2308
01:44:31.64 --> 01:44:35.68
Well I was trying to sort of stay healthy like I was like okay I know I'm not eating

2309
01:44:35.68 --> 01:44:41.04
regularly and I'm not eating very well so let me at least try to, you know.

2310
01:44:41.04 --> 01:44:44.76
And this is this is nothing that's, again I think this shows your state.

2311
01:44:44.76 --> 01:44:50.000
I go to my kids' doors heroin and fucking wheat grass juice.

2312
01:44:50.000 --> 01:45:07.44
I'd go to music stores and pretend I was gonna buy shit and just play instruments.

2313
01:45:07.44 --> 01:45:09.000
I'd hang out as long as I could and then leave.

2314
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.96
I actually got offered gigs while I was playing in stores.

2315
01:45:11.96 --> 01:45:16.000
I got offered gigs for doing sessions for different producers but I'd be all fucked up

2316
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.20
and missed the session because I wouldn't know what day it was and then realize a day or

2317
01:45:19.20 --> 01:45:22.72
two later I'd booze their business card or whatever.

2318
01:45:22.72 --> 01:45:24.000
So you just can't get your shit.

2319
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.76
Yeah, I was really just, I was pretty fucking, it was embarrassing.

2320
01:45:28.76 --> 01:45:31.12
And that was by the way that was taking place out on the West Coast.

2321
01:45:31.12 --> 01:45:32.12
Yeah, yeah, no.

2322
01:45:32.12 --> 01:45:33.68
And then just go.

2323
01:45:33.68 --> 01:45:36.80
It sounds like, yeah I went to San Francisco to get clean off drugs.

2324
01:45:36.80 --> 01:45:41.92
It's like the worst city of fucking, I don't you ever heard of Idaho?

2325
01:45:41.92 --> 01:45:42.92
Yeah, I'm on Tana.

2326
01:45:42.92 --> 01:45:55.36
Then you move back to New York and now you start kind of bringing it back together.

2327
01:45:55.36 --> 01:45:59.20
I'd go for these long runs at night because I couldn't sleep.

2328
01:45:59.20 --> 01:46:02.08
Your girl lived down by the Twin Towers and I'd run from there to central park and back

2329
01:46:02.08 --> 01:46:03.08
on the way.

2330
01:46:03.08 --> 01:46:06.52
It stopped by Coney Island High on St. Mark's place to see you was hanging out for a few minutes

2331
01:46:06.52 --> 01:46:07.52
say hi.

2332
01:46:07.52 --> 01:46:09.48
Then keep running up town to the top of the park.

2333
01:46:09.48 --> 01:46:12.88
I'd run a few laps around the reservoir and then turn around and head back down on the way

2334
01:46:12.88 --> 01:46:13.88
back down.

2335
01:46:13.88 --> 01:46:17.76
It stopped by Coney Island High again and there would be the same people.

2336
01:46:17.76 --> 01:46:21.48
Everyone was pretty much in the same place, just slightly more shit faced and it hanged

2337
01:46:21.48 --> 01:46:24.32
for a few more minutes and then keep running.

2338
01:46:24.32 --> 01:46:28.20
It was kind of good to see that as I was getting my shit together to see all these people

2339
01:46:28.20 --> 01:46:32.24
not really doing anything but standing around getting fucked up as they got older and

2340
01:46:32.24 --> 01:46:33.56
did nothing with themselves.

2341
01:46:33.56 --> 01:46:38.44
It gave me motivation to keep my shit together.

2342
01:46:38.44 --> 01:46:46.60
So yeah, that's when I started pulling myself back up.

2343
01:46:46.60 --> 01:46:49.96
And one of the things that helped out with that.

2344
01:46:49.96 --> 01:46:51.60
First of all, you guys got death jam.

2345
01:46:51.60 --> 01:46:53.24
You guys got signed a death jam?

2346
01:46:53.24 --> 01:46:54.24
Is that right?

2347
01:46:54.24 --> 01:46:55.96
We had a big-gave you an advance of it.

2348
01:46:55.96 --> 01:46:59.96
Yeah, we got an advance to record something for them and then the deal wound up falling

2349
01:46:59.96 --> 01:47:05.84
apart so we wound up being left with the recordings in our possession that we were able

2350
01:47:05.84 --> 01:47:07.72
to then put out ourselves.

2351
01:47:07.72 --> 01:47:08.72
What album was that?

2352
01:47:08.72 --> 01:47:09.72
Revenge.

2353
01:47:09.72 --> 01:47:10.72
Okay.

2354
01:47:10.72 --> 01:47:15.36
Which I thought was actually a really good album but it is what it is.

2355
01:47:15.36 --> 01:47:17.28
The shit never managed to stay together.

2356
01:47:17.28 --> 01:47:21.88
That band just had fucked up karma.

2357
01:47:21.88 --> 01:47:25.60
And around this time you started your Jiu Jitsu career.

2358
01:47:25.60 --> 01:47:26.60
Yes.

2359
01:47:26.60 --> 01:47:32.72
Yeah, well I've said it many times man, hands-o really fucking saved my life in a lot of ways

2360
01:47:32.72 --> 01:47:41.48
because even though I was doing those 12 mile runs and shit like that, I've worked my way

2361
01:47:41.48 --> 01:47:43.48
up to really doing long ones.

2362
01:47:43.48 --> 01:47:45.08
I started off doing like three or four miles.

2363
01:47:45.08 --> 01:47:48.96
I got into it.

2364
01:47:48.96 --> 01:47:58.48
But I would still have my moments of depression and I'd want to get fucked up and stuff.

2365
01:47:58.48 --> 01:48:00.88
But I had Jiu Jitsu.

2366
01:48:00.88 --> 01:48:03.48
And I was living in my rehearsal studio.

2367
01:48:03.48 --> 01:48:04.80
I didn't even have a fucking shower.

2368
01:48:04.80 --> 01:48:09.08
I was like bathing on the roof with filling up two gallon buckets.

2369
01:48:09.08 --> 01:48:12.08
I'd go up there with like four or five buckets and just like bath.

2370
01:48:12.08 --> 01:48:14.68
I was living in the rehearsal studio.

2371
01:48:14.68 --> 01:48:20.44
I wasn't, you know, life was not great but every day I'd go and I'd train.

2372
01:48:20.44 --> 01:48:26.88
And that gave me a place to find myself again.

2373
01:48:26.88 --> 01:48:28.88
When was this?

2374
01:48:28.88 --> 01:48:29.88
What year?

2375
01:48:29.88 --> 01:48:34.12
It was like January February of 96.

2376
01:48:34.12 --> 01:48:42.36
When I came back, I discovered MMA from UFC 1 and 2 when I was on the West Coast.

2377
01:48:42.36 --> 01:48:46.40
I'm like, what the fuck did he just do to him?

2378
01:48:46.40 --> 01:48:51.52
I probably hit thousand people in the face.

2379
01:48:51.52 --> 01:48:53.64
I'm a kick thousand people in the head.

2380
01:48:53.64 --> 01:48:55.72
Headbutt didn't bitten whatever.

2381
01:48:55.72 --> 01:48:59.68
I ain't never seen a triangle, choker.

2382
01:48:59.68 --> 01:49:01.60
The fuck is an arm bar.

2383
01:49:01.60 --> 01:49:03.16
I made up my mind.

2384
01:49:03.16 --> 01:49:05.40
This is when I was still on smack.

2385
01:49:05.40 --> 01:49:06.76
I was like, I made up my mind.

2386
01:49:06.76 --> 01:49:10.44
I was like, yo, if I ever get the chance to learn that shit, I'm going to fucking learn

2387
01:49:10.44 --> 01:49:12.24
that shit.

2388
01:49:12.24 --> 01:49:16.04
So when I came back to New York, I just kept going through like black belt magazine, kung fu

2389
01:49:16.04 --> 01:49:17.04
magazine.

2390
01:49:17.04 --> 01:49:19.16
One of these motherfuckers got to move right here sooner or later.

2391
01:49:19.16 --> 01:49:20.16
This is New York.

2392
01:49:20.16 --> 01:49:21.92
I mean, they can't all stay in California.

2393
01:49:21.92 --> 01:49:22.92
They're fucking crazy.

2394
01:49:22.92 --> 01:49:24.52
They're like a very big family.

2395
01:49:24.52 --> 01:49:26.60
One of them's going to have to move out here.

2396
01:49:26.60 --> 01:49:29.60
So Hanzo, I found an ad.

2397
01:49:29.60 --> 01:49:35.44
Hanzo Kukk, Gracie Kukk, it said Gracie Kukk, or you're still with his old partner.

2398
01:49:35.44 --> 01:49:41.12
Yeah, man, I went down and I met Hanzo and that changed my life.

2399
01:49:41.12 --> 01:49:44.60
That was 21 years ago.

2400
01:49:44.60 --> 01:49:48.04
And a lot of people are, they think, I don't know why they think it.

2401
01:49:48.04 --> 01:49:51.48
But they think Jiu Jitsu is going to be, you know, kind of, when you walk in, it's going

2402
01:49:51.48 --> 01:49:52.48
to be intimidating.

2403
01:49:52.48 --> 01:49:56.84
And I could tell from the way you wrote about it, Hanzo, it's just like, hey, what's up,

2404
01:49:56.84 --> 01:49:57.84
right?

2405
01:49:57.84 --> 01:49:58.84
You know, it was a little bit fun.

2406
01:49:58.84 --> 01:49:59.84
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2407
01:49:59.84 --> 01:50:03.52
He just makes you feel so welcome and so at home.

2408
01:50:03.52 --> 01:50:12.92
And he's, you know, I can say this and mean it, you know, I really love that man.

2409
01:50:12.92 --> 01:50:18.84
You know, he was there for me through some of the toughest parts of my life and he didn't

2410
01:50:18.84 --> 01:50:22.80
give up on me and he believed in me.

2411
01:50:22.80 --> 01:50:27.28
And sometimes really that's all you need is somebody to believe in you and not give up

2412
01:50:27.28 --> 01:50:28.28
on you.

2413
01:50:28.28 --> 01:50:33.64
And, you know, when I got arrested in 2012 and I was all over the papers and the news

2414
01:50:33.64 --> 01:50:39.04
and everywhere, you know, they, a lot of people were shying away from me.

2415
01:50:39.04 --> 01:50:41.52
Let's just say that.

2416
01:50:41.52 --> 01:50:48.60
For those of you who don't know, I got jumped by about five or six guys.

2417
01:50:48.60 --> 01:50:53.64
I wanted to bite a nice chunk out of one of their faces and slice in a couple of them

2418
01:50:53.64 --> 01:50:55.48
and poke in one of them.

2419
01:50:55.48 --> 01:50:58.76
In the process of me getting jumped, I got 40 stitches.

2420
01:50:58.76 --> 01:51:04.04
I was stabbed and, you know, a lot of people were like, you know, I can't believe he did

2421
01:51:04.04 --> 01:51:05.04
that.

2422
01:51:05.04 --> 01:51:06.76
I'm like, I'm like, did what?

2423
01:51:06.76 --> 01:51:08.32
You know, got jumped.

2424
01:51:08.32 --> 01:51:12.92
You know, I got fucking jumped man and fucking tell me about slicing cut and stabbing.

2425
01:51:12.92 --> 01:51:17.80
Fucking tell me shit about shit until you got five, six mother fuckers trying to take

2426
01:51:17.80 --> 01:51:20.40
your fucking life.

2427
01:51:20.40 --> 01:51:26.76
You know, then you can start talking about how could you this, how could you fuck you?

2428
01:51:26.76 --> 01:51:30.68
You know, you got five dudes kicking you in your face, stomping on you.

2429
01:51:30.68 --> 01:51:37.40
You had better be willing to stab bite or rip someone's balls off.

2430
01:51:37.40 --> 01:51:42.64
You know, that's what people don't fucking understand who have never experienced real violence

2431
01:51:42.64 --> 01:51:47.48
or real potential of death.

2432
01:51:47.48 --> 01:51:50.76
You know, when I first got into GiGetsu, it was all about the fighting.

2433
01:51:50.76 --> 01:51:55.20
You know, I was like, yeah, learn more ways to fuck people up.

2434
01:51:55.20 --> 01:51:58.52
Now I really, it's, it has nothing to do with fighting for me anymore.

2435
01:51:58.52 --> 01:52:00.56
I mean, I just love the art.

2436
01:52:00.56 --> 01:52:04.16
I love the relationships that I've made through the art.

2437
01:52:04.16 --> 01:52:08.40
I love sharing what I've learned.

2438
01:52:08.40 --> 01:52:15.88
If anything, I'm, again, you know, the fight of flight man, I'm way more likely to run

2439
01:52:15.88 --> 01:52:22.88
than fight at this point because I know how bad things can go.

2440
01:52:22.88 --> 01:52:27.64
You know, like, I actually, I might have told the story before.

2441
01:52:27.64 --> 01:52:33.24
There was a bad ass Marine and his name was DA.

2442
01:52:33.24 --> 01:52:34.12
That's what I've been called them.

2443
01:52:34.12 --> 01:52:37.96
And DA in the military, DA, start for short, for direct action.

2444
01:52:37.96 --> 01:52:39.76
But that was his initials too.

2445
01:52:39.76 --> 01:52:41.24
But it just worked.

2446
01:52:41.24 --> 01:52:42.48
And he looked like a superhero.

2447
01:52:42.48 --> 01:52:45.52
He's a total stud and he was a gangbanger from Texas.

2448
01:52:45.52 --> 01:52:48.88
And, but, you know, he'd join, he'd be like you, right?

2449
01:52:48.88 --> 01:52:52.16
But he joined, but he was a black kid, but he joined the Marine Corps.

2450
01:52:52.16 --> 01:52:53.48
And he was in force recon.

2451
01:52:53.48 --> 01:52:55.48
He was a total badass.

2452
01:52:55.48 --> 01:52:58.68
And I said, hey, man, you got to come and try to do two out.

2453
01:52:58.68 --> 01:53:00.28
And so he started training.

2454
01:53:00.28 --> 01:53:04.88
And like after like six months, he came up to me.

2455
01:53:04.88 --> 01:53:07.28
And I was like, hey, man, you know, because I was like still deploying.

2456
01:53:07.28 --> 01:53:08.28
And he, so I wouldn't seem a lot.

2457
01:53:08.28 --> 01:53:10.60
And I was like, man, how do you like to do two?

2458
01:53:10.60 --> 01:53:12.84
He was like, man, it's kind of fucked up.

2459
01:53:12.84 --> 01:53:17.40
And I was like, what do you mean, bro?

2460
01:53:17.40 --> 01:53:18.40
It's awesome.

2461
01:53:18.40 --> 01:53:22.32
He goes, you go, man, because I used to feel like a regal badass.

2462
01:53:22.32 --> 01:53:25.52
Now everybody, I see, I'm thinking, I might be a pussy.

2463
01:53:25.52 --> 01:53:30.44
So, yeah, man, it's funny.

2464
01:53:30.44 --> 01:53:31.80
It's very humbling, you know?

2465
01:53:31.80 --> 01:53:32.80
It is.

2466
01:53:32.80 --> 01:53:34.60
It's a very humbling game to play.

2467
01:53:34.60 --> 01:53:35.60
It really is.

2468
01:53:35.60 --> 01:53:41.64
But, you know, at the same time though, to me, it is, it is that though.

2469
01:53:41.64 --> 01:53:42.64
It is a game for me.

2470
01:53:42.64 --> 01:53:49.88
It's like, when I think of fighting or when I think of self defense, I believe in

2471
01:53:49.88 --> 01:53:50.88
jujitsu.

2472
01:53:50.88 --> 01:53:56.000
I mean, I am 100% of believer, but jujitsu is fun for me.

2473
01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.40
It's not about violence or self defense or fighting.

2474
01:53:58.40 --> 01:53:59.40
You know, because it's funny.

2475
01:53:59.40 --> 01:54:04.12
Yeah, because fighting and violence to me is about ending something.

2476
01:54:04.12 --> 01:54:09.84
Ending somebody, you know, I mean, because I know I could die.

2477
01:54:09.84 --> 01:54:11.12
I tell people a fucking time.

2478
01:54:11.12 --> 01:54:15.28
I'm like, you know, you don't gotta worry about like a, you know, a black belt kicking

2479
01:54:15.28 --> 01:54:16.28
your ass.

2480
01:54:16.28 --> 01:54:17.68
Because he's a black belt.

2481
01:54:17.68 --> 01:54:21.84
He's already matured past the need to kick your ass.

2482
01:54:21.84 --> 01:54:26.44
You gotta worry about that 90 pound motherfucker who will stab you without you even having

2483
01:54:26.44 --> 01:54:29.76
a chance to say dude, we don't need to have a problem.

2484
01:54:29.76 --> 01:54:36.88
You know, you gotta worry about that dude who's just so don't give a fuck that before

2485
01:54:36.88 --> 01:54:39.84
you even have a chance to say buddy.

2486
01:54:39.84 --> 01:54:44.48
You're sure it's wet and you're like, oh shit.

2487
01:54:44.48 --> 01:54:48.64
You know, and we've talked about that on here, you know, people say like, oh, I was

2488
01:54:48.64 --> 01:54:52.04
going to get in this guy, said something to my wife, what should I have done?

2489
01:54:52.04 --> 01:54:56.72
I'm like, just grab your wife, go home and buy her a nice dinner.

2490
01:54:56.72 --> 01:54:58.20
Yeah, so honey, I love you.

2491
01:54:58.20 --> 01:55:00.84
Yeah, you know, you know, it's not worth getting stabbed.

2492
01:55:00.84 --> 01:55:04.16
Yeah, it's not worth having to stab that junkie.

2493
01:55:04.16 --> 01:55:05.16
And then that either.

2494
01:55:05.16 --> 01:55:08.36
And I just know from my own experience that there's always the potential that I could go

2495
01:55:08.36 --> 01:55:09.36
to that extreme.

2496
01:55:09.36 --> 01:55:13.16
I don't think for one second because I'm a jujitsu black belt that like, I'm just

2497
01:55:13.16 --> 01:55:16.80
going to submit this guy and hold him down until the police get here because you know,

2498
01:55:16.80 --> 01:55:21.44
what, that guy may have through other friends standing in the shadows behind you or that guy

2499
01:55:21.44 --> 01:55:26.48
may fucking start stabbing you when you're looking to fucking you're trying to, you know,

2500
01:55:26.48 --> 01:55:27.48
submit him.

2501
01:55:27.48 --> 01:55:32.12
And I was suddenly like, why is my t-shirt wet?

2502
01:55:32.12 --> 01:55:34.16
What, you know, why is my pants wet?

2503
01:55:34.16 --> 01:55:37.48
Oh my God, that's fucking red.

2504
01:55:37.48 --> 01:55:46.96
So, I mean, that's just life, you know, that's why, you know, now as good as jujitsu

2505
01:55:46.96 --> 01:55:52.12
isn't as good as you felt doing it, you go on tour.

2506
01:55:52.12 --> 01:55:55.24
And just before we go on tour, you break up with girl at the time.

2507
01:55:55.24 --> 01:55:59.16
Yeah, blah, blah, blah.

2508
01:55:59.16 --> 01:56:01.68
Back to the book without the feeling of being needed.

2509
01:56:01.68 --> 01:56:03.92
I didn't feel, I had much purpose in my life.

2510
01:56:03.92 --> 01:56:08.92
I started falling back into fuck up mode. I was seeing several different chicks around

2511
01:56:08.92 --> 01:56:09.92
at that time.

2512
01:56:09.92 --> 01:56:11.92
Actually, what, so I don't have to rip it.

2513
01:56:11.92 --> 01:56:12.92
Hey, who wrote the book?

2514
01:56:12.92 --> 01:56:13.92
Yeah, I'm not sure.

2515
01:56:13.92 --> 01:56:14.92
I'm correct.

2516
01:56:14.92 --> 01:56:15.92
No, no, no, I'm correct.

2517
01:56:15.92 --> 01:56:16.92
You.

2518
01:56:16.92 --> 01:56:20.92
No, no, it wasn't even so much over just a breakup of a chick.

2519
01:56:20.92 --> 01:56:24.92
I was actually, I've been with this chick for a while and she had a daughter and I had raised her

2520
01:56:24.92 --> 01:56:25.92
daughter.

2521
01:56:25.92 --> 01:56:31.92
So it was like, you know, also not just feeling like betrayed and everything else that goes along with a breakup,

2522
01:56:31.92 --> 01:56:39.92
but as any father or stepfather, stepmother, you know, you have a certain, you know, you

2523
01:56:39.92 --> 01:56:42.92
develop love for a kid even if it's not yours.

2524
01:56:42.92 --> 01:56:47.92
You know, and that was really what was hard on me more than anything.

2525
01:56:47.92 --> 01:56:53.92
Because the mother was all fucked up on drugs and I had actually taken the kid from her and I was raising the kid for her

2526
01:56:53.92 --> 01:56:57.92
while she was off just being a fuck up.

2527
01:56:57.92 --> 01:57:01.92
And then the grandparents and me got in contact.

2528
01:57:01.92 --> 01:57:04.92
So I wound up doing, you know, what you do.

2529
01:57:04.92 --> 01:57:07.92
This is your family, this is your blood that you got to grow up with your family.

2530
01:57:07.92 --> 01:57:10.92
So that was, that's why I was struggling.

2531
01:57:10.92 --> 01:57:18.92
You know, it was because it was like, you know, I was, I never had a father that gave a fuck about me.

2532
01:57:18.92 --> 01:57:25.92
So every time I've been in a child's life, it is really mattered to me.

2533
01:57:25.92 --> 01:57:33.92
You like to be, to protect them because no one protected me, you know.

2534
01:57:33.92 --> 01:57:41.92
So that was why I really started to lose my way again, you know, because I was like, you know,

2535
01:57:41.92 --> 01:57:49.92
I don't have a purpose, there's no one for me to love, no one for me to care about and no one to feel.

2536
01:57:49.92 --> 01:57:54.92
My love, you know.

2537
01:57:54.92 --> 01:58:05.92
So yeah, the drugs started to fill in the gap again, you know, but fortunately that didn't last forever.

2538
01:58:05.92 --> 01:58:06.92
It's funny, man.

2539
01:58:06.92 --> 01:58:12.92
Some of the toughest motherfuckers actually got the biggest hearts and that's what a lot of people don't realize is, you know,

2540
01:58:12.92 --> 01:58:18.92
I'm sure that underneath this rugged exterior, you're quite a sensitive motherfucker.

2541
01:58:18.92 --> 01:58:20.92
You know, and, you're talking about me.

2542
01:58:20.92 --> 01:58:25.92
I'm talking about the guy behind you.

2543
01:58:25.92 --> 01:58:34.92
But, you know, I mean, seriously, some of the most elist motherfuckers I've known in my life have been some of the most sensitive people on the inside.

2544
01:58:34.92 --> 01:58:46.92
And I think that part of that illness has been a shield, you know, to protect themselves.

2545
01:58:46.92 --> 01:58:56.92
I know, and it probably was with me in a lot of ways, you know, if I wasn't as violent as I was, my neighborhood would have devoured me.

2546
01:58:56.92 --> 01:59:04.92
My environment would have devoured me if I wasn't as, yeah, so to your point, I agree with you.

2547
01:59:04.92 --> 01:59:13.92
And that's one of the reasons why I think going back to the Gitu, or boxing or wrestling or moi tie.

2548
01:59:13.92 --> 01:59:23.92
But when you, me, when we're kids, young men, going back to the whole thing about proving yourself, how you can prove yourself that you're tough.

2549
01:59:23.92 --> 01:59:26.92
When you're a kid, you go out and you fight and you beat people up.

2550
01:59:26.92 --> 01:59:27.92
You do stupid shit.

2551
01:59:27.92 --> 01:59:28.92
Do stupid stuff.

2552
01:59:28.92 --> 01:59:31.92
When you do Gitu, you know you're tough.

2553
01:59:31.92 --> 01:59:37.92
And you know, when you look at some guy in the street, like, hey, that guy might stab me, but if he doesn't, I'm going to, I will choke him out and take me 15 seconds.

2554
01:59:37.92 --> 01:59:47.92
So I don't have to do anything to prove that's why I think it's for me. And I think it was Tim Ferris asked me this question. He's like, what makes a man or something like that?

2555
01:59:47.92 --> 02:00:01.92
And I was like, to your point, for me, learning how to fight. So learn in Gitu, getting married and having kids and going into combat.

2556
02:00:01.92 --> 02:00:07.92
Those were the three things that I was like, okay, those three things, they were evolutionary to me.

2557
02:00:07.92 --> 02:00:13.92
And they were the three things that happened where I said, okay, I don't have to walk around trying to prove myself to this guy or that guy.

2558
02:00:13.92 --> 02:00:15.92
I know how to fight.

2559
02:00:15.92 --> 02:00:19.92
I don't even need to impress that girl over there. I got a girl.

2560
02:00:19.92 --> 02:00:24.92
You know, and I got, and I got mouths to feed so I can't act like an idiot.

2561
02:00:24.92 --> 02:00:26.92
And I know I'm not a coward.

2562
02:00:26.92 --> 02:00:32.92
And if shit goes down, I know that I will do the right thing. I know that 100%.

2563
02:00:32.92 --> 02:00:35.92
So those were the things that, to me, gave me like security as a man.

2564
02:00:35.92 --> 02:00:38.92
And so it's the same thing that you're saying.

2565
02:00:38.92 --> 02:00:47.92
You know, when we're young and you're out there just to try and prove and protect and shield your emotion.

2566
02:00:47.92 --> 02:00:48.92
You sense it too.

2567
02:00:48.92 --> 02:00:50.92
Yeah, that's what you do.

2568
02:00:50.92 --> 02:00:55.92
And so a good way to get over that, in my opinion, instead of having to fake it, you learn it for real.

2569
02:00:55.92 --> 02:00:58.92
Well, I wish I would have had you, Jitsu when I was young kid.

2570
02:00:58.92 --> 02:01:00.92
That would have helped me immensely.

2571
02:01:00.92 --> 02:01:01.92
Yeah.

2572
02:01:01.92 --> 02:01:06.92
Well, I mean, just one person I'll just mention briefly is,

2573
02:01:06.92 --> 02:01:09.92
Hi, I'm Gracie.

2574
02:01:09.92 --> 02:01:19.92
Another brother that I truly loved and, you know, he died in 2007.

2575
02:01:19.92 --> 02:01:29.92
He was a very tragic and here's a guy who was feared by 99.9% of the people that knew him.

2576
02:01:29.92 --> 02:01:33.92
And the 1% of the people that knew him fucking loved him.

2577
02:01:33.92 --> 02:01:40.92
And he was, you know, it's like, I'm saying, you know, you got these people who are fucking dangerous motherfuckers.

2578
02:01:40.92 --> 02:01:45.92
You don't even want to look at them wrong or for too long.

2579
02:01:45.92 --> 02:01:50.92
Yeah. But if they fucking love you, man, nobody better fuck with you ever.

2580
02:01:50.92 --> 02:01:53.92
No, then you got a part in the book where you're talking about. He came home. We fought in Japan.

2581
02:01:53.92 --> 02:01:54.92
Yeah.

2582
02:01:54.92 --> 02:01:56.92
Come home. He gives you, you know, you just had your first game.

2583
02:01:56.92 --> 02:01:57.92
It gives you two grand.

2584
02:01:57.92 --> 02:01:58.92
Yeah.

2585
02:01:58.92 --> 02:02:00.92
If we're not for nothing, just for being you.

2586
02:02:00.92 --> 02:02:04.92
And I didn't want to take it and he's like, shut the fuck up.

2587
02:02:04.92 --> 02:02:06.92
It's for the baby.

2588
02:02:06.92 --> 02:02:11.92
You know, I mean, I know my other fuck is my whole life.

2589
02:02:11.92 --> 02:02:17.92
You know, Dean Deen Lister, who's one of my parents and training partners and all that.

2590
02:02:17.92 --> 02:02:20.92
But he's got some funny stories about a high end.

2591
02:02:20.92 --> 02:02:22.92
And he's like, high end was fucking crazy.

2592
02:02:22.92 --> 02:02:23.92
Yeah.

2593
02:02:23.92 --> 02:02:25.92
He was a crazy motherfucker.

2594
02:02:25.92 --> 02:02:34.92
But to be honest though, I never had any crazy experiences with him because I feel like when he looked into my eyes, he knew he didn't have to prove anything to me.

2595
02:02:34.92 --> 02:02:37.92
Yeah. You guys kind of counter now.

2596
02:02:37.92 --> 02:02:38.92
What's that?

2597
02:02:38.92 --> 02:02:39.92
Yeah.

2598
02:02:39.92 --> 02:02:41.92
You know, it's kind of totally true.

2599
02:02:41.92 --> 02:02:44.92
Well, it was like, you know, I don't have to prove I'm a bad S to you.

2600
02:02:44.92 --> 02:02:46.92
You don't have to prove you're a bad S to me.

2601
02:02:46.92 --> 02:02:47.92
Let's just go out and chill.

2602
02:02:47.92 --> 02:02:48.92
That's good.

2603
02:02:48.92 --> 02:02:50.92
You know, we'd go out and like go to stupid movies.

2604
02:02:50.92 --> 02:02:55.92
Like, you know, go out and just work on his English.

2605
02:02:55.92 --> 02:02:58.92
You know, like, I'd never, you know,

2606
02:02:58.92 --> 02:03:04.92
Yeah, we had fun, you know, but we never like gotten brawls and got, you know, right.

2607
02:03:04.92 --> 02:03:06.92
But I mean, you know, he died.

2608
02:03:06.92 --> 02:03:08.92
Yeah, he got, he got a rest.

2609
02:03:08.92 --> 02:03:10.92
He was a bad S to me.

2610
02:03:10.92 --> 02:03:11.92
He was a bad S to me.

2611
02:03:11.92 --> 02:03:16.92
But, you know, again, it's like, you know, again, this is somebody who's very emotional.

2612
02:03:16.92 --> 02:03:26.92
And sadly, you know, like many people started using drugs as a way to deal with shit.

2613
02:03:26.92 --> 02:03:31.92
I guess I don't want to say to deal with shit, but maybe just as a little bit of an escape.

2614
02:03:31.92 --> 02:03:35.92
You know, you got to figure what kind of fucking, you know,

2615
02:03:35.92 --> 02:03:38.92
I mean, his favorite song was a boy named Sue by Johnny Cash.

2616
02:03:38.92 --> 02:03:43.92
And he really felt like he was living that life by being him, you know, with the name Gracie

2617
02:03:43.92 --> 02:03:48.92
and having to be, you know, always having to step up, always having to prove himself

2618
02:03:48.92 --> 02:03:50.92
and always having to be a bad S.

2619
02:03:50.92 --> 02:03:55.92
And I think that when you're forced to react and deal with things on that level all the time

2620
02:03:55.92 --> 02:04:02.92
and especially when you are actually a nice person at heart or a sensitive person at heart

2621
02:04:02.92 --> 02:04:07.92
when you're forced to always take that stance, that shit's a fucking tough one.

2622
02:04:07.92 --> 02:04:10.92
And, you know, that's a hard road to travel.

2623
02:04:10.92 --> 02:04:13.92
And, you know, I always have him with me.

2624
02:04:13.92 --> 02:04:18.92
I always have him sitting on one shoulder and hands on sitting on the other.

2625
02:04:18.92 --> 02:04:25.92
And, you know, when I get back on it, yeah, when I have big, when I am confronted by a serious shit,

2626
02:04:25.92 --> 02:04:36.92
I think about, you know, how one would react and how the other would react and then I try to find my own sense in there.

2627
02:04:36.92 --> 02:04:42.92
Yeah, I mean, it's high in this kind of a classic example of everything that we're talking about.

2628
02:04:42.92 --> 02:04:46.92
Yeah, for all, for all, practical purposes, you shouldn't be here right now.

2629
02:04:46.92 --> 02:04:48.92
You shouldn't be here either dead or in jail or whatever.

2630
02:04:48.92 --> 02:04:49.92
Yeah.

2631
02:04:49.92 --> 02:04:50.92
And he did some shit.

2632
02:04:50.92 --> 02:04:53.92
That was going down the same path, but he didn't make that.

2633
02:04:53.92 --> 02:04:57.92
You know, and that's, you know, that's the thing, man.

2634
02:04:57.92 --> 02:05:08.92
I feel really fortunate that I had music because I think that it gave me a tool to give me a paddle to row my way through the shit.

2635
02:05:08.92 --> 02:05:11.92
But it also came with its own load of shit.

2636
02:05:11.92 --> 02:05:17.92
You know, it's funny because, you know, I probably should have encouraged my kids to learn more about music and be more musical.

2637
02:05:17.92 --> 02:05:22.92
But I encourage them to be judicits who guys because I felt that, you know,

2638
02:05:22.92 --> 02:05:24.92
and then he's way safer.

2639
02:05:24.92 --> 02:05:26.92
He's gonna use his head to be better.

2640
02:05:26.92 --> 02:05:28.92
It's less off-road.

2641
02:05:28.92 --> 02:05:30.92
Yeah, that's about exit.

2642
02:05:30.92 --> 02:05:35.92
You know, you might get punching your face at Buds of Times, but at least you won't, you know, at least you won't be life punching you in your face.

2643
02:05:35.92 --> 02:05:36.92
Yeah, damn.

2644
02:05:36.92 --> 02:05:37.92
You know.

2645
02:05:37.92 --> 02:05:43.92
And there's, you know, all kinds of drama around it, you describe it again as spinal tap.

2646
02:05:43.92 --> 02:05:46.92
You know, just the rock and roll crap.

2647
02:05:46.92 --> 02:05:53.92
Cromags comes to an end for the most part, and you end up putting out a record hardly's war.

2648
02:05:53.92 --> 02:05:54.92
Yeah.

2649
02:05:54.92 --> 02:06:00.92
And, um, good, good rock and roll music, baby.

2650
02:06:00.92 --> 02:06:07.92
And now, and also during that time, you, you had some kids.

2651
02:06:07.92 --> 02:06:08.92
Yeah.

2652
02:06:08.92 --> 02:06:11.92
And, you know, you met the mother of your kids.

2653
02:06:11.92 --> 02:06:14.92
And she wanted to go to school.

2654
02:06:14.92 --> 02:06:30.92
And so you took off some time to just, yeah, I, I pretty much put my musical career on, uh, hold, you know, to take care of your kids.

2655
02:06:30.92 --> 02:06:31.92
Yeah.

2656
02:06:31.92 --> 02:06:38.92
And, uh, you know, one of the, one of the paragraphs that you wrote in here is awesome.

2657
02:06:38.92 --> 02:06:45.92
Um, talking about your kids and you say, and this is something I completely related to.

2658
02:06:45.92 --> 02:06:49.92
I'll tell you the first time I looked down at the other end of the mat and saw my boys training.

2659
02:06:49.92 --> 02:06:51.92
There was one of the greatest moments in my life.

2660
02:06:51.92 --> 02:06:56.92
My youngest son spent his birthday at the academy with George St. Pierre and all the rest of the fellas.

2661
02:06:56.92 --> 02:07:03.92
My eldest son had his birthday there with all the graces and about 30 kids, a full house and a cake with a hands-o-grace of your academy logo on it.

2662
02:07:03.92 --> 02:07:12.92
My sons have grown up with hands-o-like and uncle, Igor Hall's, Gregor, Daniel, Neiman, all the guys treat my boys like family.

2663
02:07:12.92 --> 02:07:16.92
They've known their instructor, Magnogama, since birth.

2664
02:07:16.92 --> 02:07:23.92
He came to the hospital to see them hours after they were born and hands-o, they have known since they were days old.

2665
02:07:23.92 --> 02:07:30.92
My eldest son, I have been on gray, howl and buses in the middle of the night, traveling hours away to represent RGA and team, and so greasy.

2666
02:07:30.92 --> 02:07:39.92
I have competed with my sons at National Enranct, grappling submission and GJ, one of my proudest moments was when we both competed at the same event.

2667
02:07:39.92 --> 02:07:49.92
My son took first place in his division and I took second place in the expert master's division in the 30 to 35 year old age bracket, although I was 44.

2668
02:07:49.92 --> 02:08:02.92
Hands-o-joked when he first saw my son, this is the proof that even though the fruit is rotten, the seed can still be good.

2669
02:08:02.92 --> 02:08:06.92
Yeah, we all know that one.

2670
02:08:06.92 --> 02:08:14.92
I guess it's when you see your kid doing anything that you love doing, and you see get to see your kid do it echo, you got that in your future.

2671
02:08:14.92 --> 02:08:20.92
When you see your kid, oh, you see your daughter on the mat right now, and that's cool.

2672
02:08:20.92 --> 02:08:31.92
When you see your kid training, and I'm to the point right now, my son's a big kid, he's 14, but I can roll with him, and I can legit roll with him.

2673
02:08:31.92 --> 02:08:32.92
He's taller than me.

2674
02:08:32.92 --> 02:08:35.92
He's 14 years, six foot, but 80.

2675
02:08:35.92 --> 02:08:38.92
Yeah, I was even hooked on me.

2676
02:08:38.92 --> 02:08:52.92
Yeah, and it's awesome when you get to train, and you know the other thing I noticed, I surf and when my son, as good as it feels to surf, like as good, there's a really good feeling you surf.

2677
02:08:52.92 --> 02:09:07.92
As good as that feels, it feels just as good, if not better to be paddling back out after catching away, even see my son just just, just getting after it, it's so awesome.

2678
02:09:07.92 --> 02:09:17.92
It's like, you know, I'll just like, watch him and you try not to like contain yourself, but it's so awesome.

2679
02:09:17.92 --> 02:09:19.92
It's so cool.

2680
02:09:19.92 --> 02:09:26.92
And you know, you see, and I got a bunch of daughters to and seeing them do when they, basically when you see your kids kicking ass, it's stuff, man.

2681
02:09:26.92 --> 02:09:27.92
It's nice.

2682
02:09:27.92 --> 02:09:34.92
And it makes you feel fucking good, you know, and you see them doing positive shifts, especially man, because God knows, I mean, I've done so much negative shit.

2683
02:09:34.92 --> 02:09:39.92
When I see my kids doing something positive, it's gonna feel really good, you know.

2684
02:09:39.92 --> 02:09:48.92
Going back to the book, talking about your dad, my dad, my father died from a fire.

2685
02:09:48.92 --> 02:09:55.92
So your father, and we didn't talk about him much, he'd gone away, and then he'd like had intermittent contact with you over the years.

2686
02:09:55.92 --> 02:10:02.92
Well, actually, once he was out of my life, I, you know, my mom left him when I was really young, you know.

2687
02:10:02.92 --> 02:10:07.92
I never saw him again, and I only actually spoke to him twice on the phone.

2688
02:10:07.92 --> 02:10:19.92
I got like one letter from him, and it was like one or two pages and a cassette of him playing guitar in a halfway house.

2689
02:10:19.92 --> 02:10:25.92
And basically, it's apologizing a lot.

2690
02:10:25.92 --> 02:10:54.92
And, yeah, you know, he knew he made a lot of bad choices, but it's fucked up though, because, you know, I mean, he was all, you know, he's fucked up on heroin, and he was in alcoholic, and he actually, like, kicked my mother in the stomach when she was just like very pregnant with me.

2691
02:10:54.92 --> 02:11:02.92
You know, and, you know, yeah, that's how much he didn't want me.

2692
02:11:02.92 --> 02:11:16.92
So, you know, it's a, it's a hard bill of swall, you know, when your father would rather be strong on heroin than be your father.

2693
02:11:16.92 --> 02:11:29.92
But, but I've managed to turn it around, you know, because I love being with not just my kids, but I teach the kids at the Hands of Gracie Academy.

2694
02:11:29.92 --> 02:11:42.92
And so the child that I didn't really have, I get to experience and live my cariously through all these other kids, and I get to be a role model to them, where as I didn't have any.

2695
02:11:42.92 --> 02:11:54.92
And, you know, I'm teaching these little boys and little girls how to defend themselves and how to fight and how to fight and have honor and how to lose with honor.

2696
02:11:54.92 --> 02:12:06.92
And, always to shake their opponents hand and say, good job, whether they win or whether they lose and how to have that respect for their opponent as well as themselves.

2697
02:12:06.92 --> 02:12:15.92
You know, when I teach these kids that, you know, they're like they say in jujitsu, there's no losing in jujitsu, you win or you learn.

2698
02:12:15.92 --> 02:12:31.92
And when I can take a kid who, you know, I've worked with a lot of kids who have, you know, varying degrees of spectrum disorders, whether they've autism or physical issues.

2699
02:12:31.92 --> 02:12:44.92
And to see the improvement that they make, not just at jujitsu, but in their social skills, you know, kids who are so insecure that they won't look at you.

2700
02:12:44.92 --> 02:12:47.92
And now they're making eye contact with you talking to you.

2701
02:12:47.92 --> 02:12:54.92
To like change your face and shaking your hand and their chest is out, your shoulders are back and they're not all.

2702
02:12:54.92 --> 02:13:07.92
You know, that, you know, so where I didn't have certain things, you know, at the end of the day it gave me something else.

2703
02:13:07.92 --> 02:13:16.92
It gave me the ability to value that, that relationship that you can have with children and a lot of people take for granted a lot of.

2704
02:13:16.92 --> 02:13:26.92
And you get disappointed with a lot of the parents that bring their kids to jujitsu because I feel like, you know, you're a lot of people hand their kids off to everybody else to teach them how to do everything.

2705
02:13:26.92 --> 02:13:31.92
You know, they don't work on stuff at home with them, they don't sit there and then teach them, they don't.

2706
02:13:31.92 --> 02:13:37.92
I get, you know, when you have a kid that doesn't know how to do a fucking jumping jack, you're like, what the fuck.

2707
02:13:37.92 --> 02:13:48.92
The, your parents do it you, they don't roll around with you, they don't teach you how to do a summer saw, I have to teach you which is your left and your right hand, like really, you know.

2708
02:13:48.92 --> 02:14:03.92
I don't think people value that time enough and I have said it before it's like, you know, your job made your career may change several times in your life, your spouse may not be your spouse for it, but your kids are always going to be your kids.

2709
02:14:03.92 --> 02:14:11.92
You really have to cherish and value that and the time that you spend with them because they'll always be your kids.

2710
02:14:11.92 --> 02:14:19.92
And that woman that you think you're in love with may leave you, you may fall out of love.

2711
02:14:19.92 --> 02:14:32.92
Your job may, you know, fold, but your kids, you're going to be your kids forever and they'll always need you, even if it's just emotionally to know that you're there.

2712
02:14:32.92 --> 02:14:47.92
Even if they're not seeing you every year or every six months or even if you don't speak to them, they, you know, you still have to be an emotional and spiritual backbone even from afar.

2713
02:14:47.92 --> 02:14:53.92
You know, I mean, I, you know, I forgive you, dad.

2714
02:14:53.92 --> 02:15:06.92
Yeah, you, uh, when he died, you actually flew down to Texas to, you know, basically to bury him.

2715
02:15:06.92 --> 02:15:10.92
And that, that was cool too.

2716
02:15:10.92 --> 02:15:15.92
I got finally meet his mother and learn about my father side of the family.

2717
02:15:15.92 --> 02:15:18.92
So there was some closure in that.

2718
02:15:18.92 --> 02:15:23.92
But I buried him myself. I wouldn't let anybody throw dirt on top of him.

2719
02:15:23.92 --> 02:15:37.92
And, uh, and as it turned out, I wound up buried my mom too with my, with my youngest son.

2720
02:15:37.92 --> 02:15:51.92
You're, um, you're now, you were kind of wrapping up this book when you were writing it.

2721
02:15:51.92 --> 02:15:55.92
And, and you know, you kind of closed it out.

2722
02:15:55.92 --> 02:16:02.92
And when you closed it out, you, you said this at the end of the book.

2723
02:16:02.92 --> 02:16:08.92
I guess part of being a father is learning how to eat a certain amount of shit. You do it for your kids, because they need you.

2724
02:16:08.92 --> 02:16:14.92
You just throw a little on a little salt and pepper and maybe some to basketball and smile, because you got to be there for them.

2725
02:16:14.92 --> 02:16:20.92
One thing my father said was, I've got all these years of experience experiences that I don't know what to do with.

2726
02:16:20.92 --> 02:16:23.92
And that's kind of how I feel with my boys.

2727
02:16:23.92 --> 02:16:28.92
How do I come in for a graceful landing after so much fucking turbulence in my life?

2728
02:16:28.92 --> 02:16:34.92
Hopefully I can guide them better than I was guided or at least maybe they will learn from my mistakes.

2729
02:16:34.92 --> 02:16:39.92
God knows I've made enough for everybody.

2730
02:16:39.92 --> 02:16:46.92
And if I remember correctly, that was the kind of the end of the book.

2731
02:16:46.92 --> 02:16:50.92
And then you were moving on and then, and then,

2732
02:16:50.92 --> 02:16:53.92
2012 comes along.

2733
02:16:53.92 --> 02:16:57.92
And there's like a hardcore fest.

2734
02:16:57.92 --> 02:17:00.92
You know, they're kind of bringing back like, I don't know if it's like a reunion fest,

2735
02:17:00.92 --> 02:17:02.92
bringing back a bunch of old bands.

2736
02:17:02.92 --> 02:17:10.92
And the Chrome Max, I should say a formation of the Chrome Max or members of the Chrome Max.

2737
02:17:10.92 --> 02:17:12.92
So I'm saying you can just call it the faux Max.

2738
02:17:12.92 --> 02:17:13.92
Let's just keep it real man.

2739
02:17:13.92 --> 02:17:19.92
They were going to play a fake ass band that does my songs with one of the old members.

2740
02:17:19.92 --> 02:17:21.92
And they were going to play.

2741
02:17:21.92 --> 02:17:22.92
Yes.

2742
02:17:22.92 --> 02:17:27.92
And you were like, okay, you know, I'm going to go check it out.

2743
02:17:27.92 --> 02:17:29.92
And you know what, I'll bring my base maybe get on stage.

2744
02:17:29.92 --> 02:17:33.92
But you know what, there was actually two members of the original group playing that night.

2745
02:17:33.92 --> 02:17:42.92
And my intention was to go and to extend my hand and say, you know what guys, I, I, I love you guys.

2746
02:17:42.92 --> 02:17:45.92
As much as I hate you, I love you.

2747
02:17:45.92 --> 02:17:49.92
You know, and just because I like to think that the end of the day,

2748
02:17:49.92 --> 02:17:54.92
two people that were friends can laugh at their own foolishness, you know,

2749
02:17:54.92 --> 02:18:03.92
I would like to think that people are able to look beyond their egos and, and forgive each other for being idiots.

2750
02:18:03.92 --> 02:18:07.92
Because God knows we all are at times.

2751
02:18:07.92 --> 02:18:15.92
So yeah, I went to that show with the hope of maybe even being invited up on stage to play a few songs with them.

2752
02:18:15.92 --> 02:18:18.92
And, well, the rest is history.

2753
02:18:18.92 --> 02:18:21.92
Yeah, you show up and, and here you go.

2754
02:18:21.92 --> 02:18:25.92
You're walking through the place you go to the, you get invited up the dressing room.

2755
02:18:25.92 --> 02:18:26.92
Hey, come say hi.

2756
02:18:26.92 --> 02:18:28.92
And then here we go back to the book.

2757
02:18:28.92 --> 02:18:31.92
As soon as I walked in, I literally walked into the room took two steps, the door shut,

2758
02:18:31.92 --> 02:18:33.92
and I got punched from behind.

2759
02:18:33.92 --> 02:18:36.92
Out of the corner, I, my eye, I could see was some big dude with tattoos.

2760
02:18:36.92 --> 02:18:38.92
It was like bam, he hit me hard.

2761
02:18:38.92 --> 02:18:43.92
I saw a bit of a flash bulb like you see when you get hit out of nowhere and you don't expect it.

2762
02:18:43.92 --> 02:18:47.92
And then it was a reign of fists and kicks that were coming from every direction of the room.

2763
02:18:47.92 --> 02:18:48.92
And this was a small room.

2764
02:18:48.92 --> 02:18:49.92
It's a dressing room.

2765
02:18:49.92 --> 02:18:50.92
And I started falling forward.

2766
02:18:50.92 --> 02:18:54.92
I fell onto the couch and rolled onto my back and started throwing up kicks just instinctively

2767
02:18:54.92 --> 02:18:56.92
to get people off me.

2768
02:18:56.92 --> 02:18:59.92
I was getting jump by at least four or five guys probably more.

2769
02:18:59.92 --> 02:19:01.92
There was a bunch of people in the room.

2770
02:19:01.92 --> 02:19:06.92
I think I counted seven or eight, although I couldn't even really count in all the chaos.

2771
02:19:06.92 --> 02:19:08.92
At that point, I reached into my pocket.

2772
02:19:08.92 --> 02:19:09.92
I had a little knife.

2773
02:19:09.92 --> 02:19:10.92
I pulled it out.

2774
02:19:10.92 --> 02:19:12.92
And it still had a cheeton.

2775
02:19:12.92 --> 02:19:16.92
So I just tried to punch the first person that was in front of me and get them the fuck off me.

2776
02:19:16.92 --> 02:19:18.92
Everybody started screaming.

2777
02:19:18.92 --> 02:19:23.92
I saw the door of the dressing room open and I started yelling security security.

2778
02:19:23.92 --> 02:19:25.92
And then I left.

2779
02:19:25.92 --> 02:19:28.92
And then I saw somebody pull the door shut.

2780
02:19:28.92 --> 02:19:30.92
And I thought to myself, fuck these dudes.

2781
02:19:30.92 --> 02:19:33.92
Their intention is to fuck me up and then I want no one to see it.

2782
02:19:33.92 --> 02:19:35.92
They're trying to beat this shit out of me.

2783
02:19:35.92 --> 02:19:40.92
And I've seen all these dudes in a pack kicking people to the point where their brains don't

2784
02:19:40.92 --> 02:19:41.92
fucking work.

2785
02:19:41.92 --> 02:19:45.92
And I knew right then if I didn't get the fuck out of that situation, I was not going to make it

2786
02:19:45.92 --> 02:19:46.92
home in one piece.

2787
02:19:46.92 --> 02:19:52.92
So I started flailing the knife as fiercely as I could just to get myself the fuck out of that situation

2788
02:19:52.92 --> 02:19:55.92
and toward the door.

2789
02:19:55.92 --> 02:19:56.92
Everybody screaming.

2790
02:19:56.92 --> 02:19:57.92
He's got a knife.

2791
02:19:57.92 --> 02:19:58.92
He's got a knife.

2792
02:19:58.92 --> 02:20:01.92
And I don't even know who it was or how they ended up in my face.

2793
02:20:01.92 --> 02:20:03.92
I guess it was when they were lunging in my arm.

2794
02:20:03.92 --> 02:20:05.92
I bit whoever wasn't front of my face.

2795
02:20:05.92 --> 02:20:07.92
I tore a big piece out of his cheek.

2796
02:20:07.92 --> 02:20:09.92
It was obvious it was a setup.

2797
02:20:09.92 --> 02:20:12.92
When I saw the door pulled shut, I was fighting for my life.

2798
02:20:12.92 --> 02:20:16.92
These guys wanted to kick the shit out of me, stomped me out and no one would see it.

2799
02:20:16.92 --> 02:20:20.92
There would be no whist witnesses and that would be that.

2800
02:20:20.92 --> 02:20:22.92
But that shit was not going down.

2801
02:20:22.92 --> 02:20:23.92
I bet the one guy's face.

2802
02:20:23.92 --> 02:20:25.92
I just tore his fucking cheek open right below his eye.

2803
02:20:25.92 --> 02:20:27.92
He was screaming blood was running down.

2804
02:20:27.92 --> 02:20:29.92
His face I bit someone's wrist.

2805
02:20:29.92 --> 02:20:31.92
As they were trying to get the knife out of my hand.

2806
02:20:31.92 --> 02:20:32.92
I just didn't bite it.

2807
02:20:32.92 --> 02:20:34.92
I tried to tear a piece out.

2808
02:20:34.92 --> 02:20:36.92
That's in the bouncer's broken to the room.

2809
02:20:36.92 --> 02:20:41.92
At this point, I was on the bottom of a pile trying to stab and kick and everybody started trying to grab my hand.

2810
02:20:41.92 --> 02:20:44.92
They're like, give me the knife, give me the knife on security.

2811
02:20:44.92 --> 02:20:47.92
I ended up getting dragged out onto the balcony, getting kicked.

2812
02:20:47.92 --> 02:20:52.92
I got one good kick and I write face and I'm surprised it did knock my teeth out.

2813
02:20:52.92 --> 02:20:56.92
One dude's scream, get on your stomach, get on your stomach, put your hands out and front of you.

2814
02:20:56.92 --> 02:21:02.92
This one big guy stepped on my back with both of his feet and another guy was looking at my face and squeezing my throat.

2815
02:21:02.92 --> 02:21:04.92
I don't know who the fuck was.

2816
02:21:04.92 --> 02:21:07.92
One guy looked at me and said, mother fucker, I'll kill you.

2817
02:21:07.92 --> 02:21:08.92
I'll kill you.

2818
02:21:08.92 --> 02:21:12.92
I will kick you in your fucking face until you are dead mother fucker if you don't stop moving.

2819
02:21:12.92 --> 02:21:17.92
I saw a peek from sick of it all in the crowd of people next to us with a freaked out look on his face.

2820
02:21:17.92 --> 02:21:21.92
He was gesturing with his hands from you to calm down and stop resisting.

2821
02:21:21.92 --> 02:21:24.92
You kept mouthing the words, hardly chill, hardly.

2822
02:21:24.92 --> 02:21:26.92
Please stop, chill, hardly.

2823
02:21:26.92 --> 02:21:28.92
That's in one guy said, put your hands out and front of you.

2824
02:21:28.92 --> 02:21:31.92
I asked her, you a cop, he was like, yeah, so I said, show me your badge.

2825
02:21:31.92 --> 02:21:35.92
And at that point, the boys in blue came running up the stairs.

2826
02:21:35.92 --> 02:21:37.92
I was like, fine, I'm not moving anymore.

2827
02:21:37.92 --> 02:21:41.92
I stopped my hands out and front of me, face down on the floor.

2828
02:21:41.92 --> 02:21:43.92
I still didn't know that I've been stabbed.

2829
02:21:43.92 --> 02:21:44.92
I got 40 stitches in my leg.

2830
02:21:44.92 --> 02:21:46.92
Thank God, it was in my leg.

2831
02:21:46.92 --> 02:21:51.92
Only the cops cuffed me, turned me over and that's when I saw the wound in my leg.

2832
02:21:51.92 --> 02:21:52.92
It was a grotesque.

2833
02:21:52.92 --> 02:21:54.92
The blood was bubbling out of it.

2834
02:21:54.92 --> 02:21:57.92
The fashion tendons were literally hanging out of my leg.

2835
02:21:57.92 --> 02:22:00.92
That's why people started saying that it was a compound fracture.

2836
02:22:00.92 --> 02:22:01.92
The cops cuffed me.

2837
02:22:01.92 --> 02:22:05.92
They put me on a chair, carried me down the stairs and put me in the ambulance.

2838
02:22:05.92 --> 02:22:12.92
It wasn't until I got cleaned up in the ambulance that they realized it was a stab wound.

2839
02:22:12.92 --> 02:22:16.92
That was fun, man.

2840
02:22:16.92 --> 02:22:19.92
So, and you kind of already talked about this.

2841
02:22:19.92 --> 02:22:21.92
I mean, they basically arrest you immediately.

2842
02:22:21.92 --> 02:22:23.92
Yes, total melee.

2843
02:22:23.92 --> 02:22:24.92
Yeah.

2844
02:22:24.92 --> 02:22:28.92
And I actually, when I got arrested, I thought we were all going to get arrested.

2845
02:22:28.92 --> 02:22:30.92
And there was this going to be like a bar fight.

2846
02:22:30.92 --> 02:22:31.92
Everybody got pulled in.

2847
02:22:31.92 --> 02:22:41.92
All these fucking guys started making statements that were basically that I've launched into the room and started just stabbing people.

2848
02:22:41.92 --> 02:22:45.92
So, you know, you got a room full of people saying he didn't, he didn't, he didn't, he didn't, he didn't.

2849
02:22:45.92 --> 02:22:47.92
And you got one amazing thing.

2850
02:22:47.92 --> 02:22:48.92
What the fuck happened?

2851
02:22:48.92 --> 02:22:51.92
And the fuck you think is going to get walked out in the cuffs.

2852
02:22:51.92 --> 02:22:52.92
Yeah.

2853
02:22:52.92 --> 02:22:55.92
And you end up on rikers.

2854
02:22:55.92 --> 02:22:56.92
Yeah.

2855
02:22:56.92 --> 02:23:00.92
Rikers island for those of you who don't know from around the world is jail.

2856
02:23:00.92 --> 02:23:02.92
New York, jail.

2857
02:23:02.92 --> 02:23:03.92
Rikers island.

2858
02:23:03.92 --> 02:23:17.92
And meanwhile, the media, you know, is putting out all these, the version that's get told to the media, which is that you instigated it and you are a horrible person, etc.

2859
02:23:17.92 --> 02:23:19.92
And now you got it rikers island.

2860
02:23:19.92 --> 02:23:23.92
Going back to the book, all night you'd hear people screaming and talking shit.

2861
02:23:23.92 --> 02:23:26.92
The youth offenders were in the same building as us right next door.

2862
02:23:26.92 --> 02:23:31.92
So all night you'd hear them screaming, suck my dick, mother fucker off fuck you up, suck my dick.

2863
02:23:31.92 --> 02:23:33.92
It was fun.

2864
02:23:33.92 --> 02:23:33.92
It was fun.

2865
02:23:33.92 --> 02:23:33.92
It was fun.

2866
02:23:33.92 --> 02:23:35.92
Fuck you, stop, fuck.

2867
02:23:35.92 --> 02:23:36.92
All night, fuck.

2868
02:23:36.92 --> 02:23:36.92
All night, fuck.

2869
02:23:36.92 --> 02:23:37.92
It was fun.

2870
02:23:37.92 --> 02:23:38.92
It was fun.

2871
02:23:38.92 --> 02:23:40.92
I just fucking cry, sir.

2872
02:23:40.92 --> 02:23:43.92
Riot cops came in all the, all fucking night.

2873
02:23:43.92 --> 02:23:48.92
Then as soon as the sun would start coming up and they'd finally shut up, the seagulls would start making noise.

2874
02:23:48.92 --> 02:23:49.92
It was nonstop.

2875
02:23:49.92 --> 02:23:52.92
Ironically, it was the best sleep I'd gotten in a while.

2876
02:23:52.92 --> 02:23:55.92
Ever since I started going through the bullshit with my ex.

2877
02:23:55.92 --> 02:23:59.92
My life had truly become a nightmare.

2878
02:23:59.92 --> 02:24:04.92
I remember at one point I was looking out through my window through the gates.

2879
02:24:04.92 --> 02:24:09.92
It was a beautiful sunny day and I could hear the birds and a butterfly flew past my window.

2880
02:24:09.92 --> 02:24:11.92
And I was like damn.

2881
02:24:11.92 --> 02:24:15.92
Right then, and there that butterfly represented freedom.

2882
02:24:15.92 --> 02:24:19.92
What I wouldn't do to be free right then, I had no idea what was going to happen.

2883
02:24:19.92 --> 02:24:24.92
My lawyer told me I was possibly looking at two and a half years in the house.

2884
02:24:24.92 --> 02:24:31.92
I was like, I'm just looking at the birds in jail.

2885
02:24:31.92 --> 02:24:33.92
Rough.

2886
02:24:33.92 --> 02:24:37.92
Yeah, I remember that butterfly, vividly.

2887
02:24:37.92 --> 02:24:40.92
Happy young.

2888
02:24:40.92 --> 02:24:42.92
Get that?

2889
02:24:42.92 --> 02:24:43.92
Yeah.

2890
02:24:43.92 --> 02:24:45.92
You get that?

2891
02:24:45.92 --> 02:24:47.92
I know what I'm about.

2892
02:24:47.92 --> 02:24:48.92
Happy young.

2893
02:24:48.92 --> 02:24:50.92
It's also a different person.

2894
02:24:50.92 --> 02:24:52.92
It was not in France.

2895
02:24:52.92 --> 02:24:54.92
It's like whatever island.

2896
02:24:54.92 --> 02:24:55.92
Yeah, yeah.

2897
02:24:55.92 --> 02:24:56.92
It was a prison island.

2898
02:24:56.92 --> 02:24:57.92
It was a fucking no joke.

2899
02:24:57.92 --> 02:24:58.92
No joke.

2900
02:24:58.92 --> 02:25:00.92
It was a no joke.

2901
02:25:00.92 --> 02:25:03.92
And we always find the good in things.

2902
02:25:03.92 --> 02:25:06.92
And you got a visitor that came to visit you.

2903
02:25:06.92 --> 02:25:08.92
A woman by the name of Laura.

2904
02:25:08.92 --> 02:25:09.92
Yes.

2905
02:25:09.92 --> 02:25:13.92
Who is now goes by the name of Laura Lee Flanagan.

2906
02:25:13.92 --> 02:25:19.92
And she was, she had interviewed you for what, for what website?

2907
02:25:19.92 --> 02:25:26.92
Well, she had a website called NewYorkNatives.com.

2908
02:25:26.92 --> 02:25:32.92
They did a lot of stories about things happening in the city and interesting people in

2909
02:25:32.92 --> 02:25:35.92
this net and blogs and stuff.

2910
02:25:35.92 --> 02:25:43.92
She interviewed me as a native icon because you wouldn't know it from looking at her

2911
02:25:43.92 --> 02:25:45.92
or by her career.

2912
02:25:45.92 --> 02:25:49.92
She's a lawyer, she's, you know, from the Aubrey side.

2913
02:25:49.92 --> 02:25:51.92
She's amazing.

2914
02:25:51.92 --> 02:25:56.92
And she used to be in the hardcore for a brief moment in her childhood.

2915
02:25:56.92 --> 02:26:01.92
So she knew of the Chrome, actually had seen us play.

2916
02:26:01.92 --> 02:26:08.92
And a friend of hers, they were doing, she did a story on C-squat.

2917
02:26:08.92 --> 02:26:10.92
Squat that I used to live in.

2918
02:26:10.92 --> 02:26:13.92
And it was really a good story.

2919
02:26:13.92 --> 02:26:14.92
It was very interesting.

2920
02:26:14.92 --> 02:26:17.92
And one of the people she spoke to around that time, said you should speak to Harley.

2921
02:26:17.92 --> 02:26:23.92
He used to live there and he'd be interesting for you know, for you to interview.

2922
02:26:23.92 --> 02:26:25.92
And she pursued it.

2923
02:26:25.92 --> 02:26:30.92
And we started talking, we did the interview.

2924
02:26:30.92 --> 02:26:37.92
And I started sending her some chapters of this book that I was still working on at the

2925
02:26:37.92 --> 02:26:38.92
time.

2926
02:26:38.92 --> 02:26:44.92
And I don't remember how exactly it came about.

2927
02:26:44.92 --> 02:26:50.92
I mean, she has a PhD and she's done a lot of writing and stuff in her life and a lot of editing

2928
02:26:50.92 --> 02:26:51.92
and stuff.

2929
02:26:51.92 --> 02:26:53.92
And she really enjoyed the book.

2930
02:26:53.92 --> 02:26:55.92
And I needed some help in the editing.

2931
02:26:55.92 --> 02:26:58.92
I mean, I have a seventh grade education.

2932
02:26:58.92 --> 02:27:03.92
So the book was basically one sentence when I gave it to her.

2933
02:27:03.92 --> 02:27:07.92
You know, she gets the award for like editing challenges.

2934
02:27:07.92 --> 02:27:11.92
I mean, it was, it was, it was, it was better tonight.

2935
02:27:11.92 --> 02:27:12.92
I was like, yeah, you edited the book.

2936
02:27:12.92 --> 02:27:14.92
And then we, because I was an English major too.

2937
02:27:14.92 --> 02:27:20.92
And we had a moment of like, I gave her a moment of mutual respect and an ad barration for

2938
02:27:20.92 --> 02:27:21.92
your efforts.

2939
02:27:21.92 --> 02:27:23.92
You don't know how much I would see.

2940
02:27:23.92 --> 02:27:26.92
I mean, this book, okay, it's like 300 pages.

2941
02:27:26.92 --> 02:27:28.92
It would have been a thousand pages.

2942
02:27:28.92 --> 02:27:31.92
And it was like I said, it was one sentence.

2943
02:27:31.92 --> 02:27:36.92
And we literally had to like, okay, we've got 10 stories about fighting now.

2944
02:27:36.92 --> 02:27:38.92
Can we lose these other 20?

2945
02:27:38.92 --> 02:27:42.92
Okay, we've got 10 stories about like almost overdosing.

2946
02:27:42.92 --> 02:27:44.92
Can we lose the other 30?

2947
02:27:44.92 --> 02:27:51.92
Okay, we've got, you know, so it was a, you know, I mean, it would have been a fucking endless book.

2948
02:27:51.92 --> 02:27:56.92
I mean, I took a lot of fights and a lot of drugs and a lot of rock and roll dumbness.

2949
02:27:56.92 --> 02:28:01.92
And just a lot of, actually, good stories didn't make it in, you know.

2950
02:28:01.92 --> 02:28:08.92
But I think I think we got left with a pretty good picture of everything, you know.

2951
02:28:08.92 --> 02:28:14.92
Everybody, it's actually funny because when I had the book signing a lot of people that I went to school with and like

2952
02:28:14.92 --> 02:28:18.92
5, 6 grade from my neighborhood showed up and they were like, dude, you nailed it, man.

2953
02:28:18.92 --> 02:28:21.92
You described the neighborhood so perfectly.

2954
02:28:21.92 --> 02:28:25.92
And the funny shit is actually one of the hitmen, the guys from my block was at my book signing.

2955
02:28:25.92 --> 02:28:30.92
And I actually asked him, I was like, dude, who the fuck was pigman?

2956
02:28:30.92 --> 02:28:35.92
And he's like, oh, man, that was crazy, Eddie.

2957
02:28:35.92 --> 02:28:37.92
And crazy, Eddie was a brand of PCP.

2958
02:28:37.92 --> 02:28:40.92
We always smoke back then, so I'm sure that's why he got the nickname.

2959
02:28:40.92 --> 02:28:48.92
But he's like, man, you know, he's got an auto body shop now, grandkids, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2960
02:28:48.92 --> 02:28:51.92
Like, where did you know, I'm like, what's on the message itself?

2961
02:28:51.92 --> 02:28:58.92
You know, but it was funny because literally like all that actually mattered more to me than the reviews of the book was

2962
02:28:58.92 --> 02:29:03.92
when I had people who were shared those experiences and people who grew up in the neighborhood.

2963
02:29:03.92 --> 02:29:09.92
I mean, even more so than the Chromex parts of the books like the people who were like, you know, you fucking nailed it, man.

2964
02:29:09.92 --> 02:29:11.92
This is exactly what the city was like.

2965
02:29:11.92 --> 02:29:13.92
I try to tell people all the time and they don't get it.

2966
02:29:13.92 --> 02:29:17.92
So I'm fucked up and I'm copied just so they could fucking see for themselves.

2967
02:29:17.92 --> 02:29:20.92
That was when I knew that I nailed it.

2968
02:29:20.92 --> 02:29:26.92
You know, that was, that was, you know, there was a couple publishers that didn't want to put it out.

2969
02:29:26.92 --> 02:29:28.92
They're like, yeah, we can't touch this.

2970
02:29:28.92 --> 02:29:30.92
Yeah, no, I can imagine.

2971
02:29:30.92 --> 02:29:35.92
Like, hey, you know how, you know, your wife had to lose like 20 to fight stories.

2972
02:29:35.92 --> 02:29:37.92
Yeah, I had to do for this podcast.

2973
02:29:37.92 --> 02:29:41.92
I got ready to, you know, we discussed a fraction of the crazy shit that's out here.

2974
02:29:41.92 --> 02:29:42.92
Yeah, no, I mean, we haven't even touched.

2975
02:29:42.92 --> 02:29:46.92
I mean, we could sit here and talk for the fucking, you know, tomorrow.

2976
02:29:46.92 --> 02:29:52.92
And, you know, but, but I do, you know, I just, the book gets it across.

2977
02:29:52.92 --> 02:29:57.92
And that's why, like I said, I thought I was familiar with the hardcore scene.

2978
02:29:57.92 --> 02:30:00.92
And factually, I mean, I went to CBGBs.

2979
02:30:00.92 --> 02:30:04.92
I don't know, hundreds of times when I was a kid.

2980
02:30:04.92 --> 02:30:07.92
And all shows all over the East Coast, Boston.

2981
02:30:07.92 --> 02:30:08.92
Yeah.

2982
02:30:08.92 --> 02:30:15.92
So, but I still didn't recognize that there was this much chaos.

2983
02:30:15.92 --> 02:30:18.92
And speaking of chaos, I'm going to go back to the book here.

2984
02:30:18.92 --> 02:30:22.92
I'm sitting in jail and here we go because of all the people talking shit and trying to frame me.

2985
02:30:22.92 --> 02:30:26.92
The record label I just signed with was having second thoughts.

2986
02:30:26.92 --> 02:30:29.92
Everything was coming to a head and now I had to prepare for a court date,

2987
02:30:29.92 --> 02:30:36.92
facing four felony counts of second degree assault and weapons charges for biting and stabbing people.

2988
02:30:36.92 --> 02:30:40.92
If there was ever, and I teach the kids.

2989
02:30:40.92 --> 02:30:46.92
If there was ever a time that I was about to lose my shit, I'd have to say it was around this time.

2990
02:30:46.92 --> 02:30:52.92
If there was ever a time someone would relapse into drugs, alcohol or self-destructive shit,

2991
02:30:52.92 --> 02:30:54.92
it was a time like this.

2992
02:30:54.92 --> 02:30:58.92
I actually went out and got drunk a few nights, which I hadn't done in a long time.

2993
02:30:58.92 --> 02:31:00.92
I was really depressed.

2994
02:31:00.92 --> 02:31:02.92
I was really at the bottom.

2995
02:31:02.92 --> 02:31:06.92
I could have easily spun out a control, but I said to myself, fuck that.

2996
02:31:06.92 --> 02:31:14.92
I'm not going to let myself go and do that to myself or my kids or give in and give the satisfaction to my enemies.

2997
02:31:14.92 --> 02:31:16.92
I'm a black belt.

2998
02:31:16.92 --> 02:31:18.92
I have more control than that now.

2999
02:31:18.92 --> 02:31:20.92
I'm not who I once was.

3000
02:31:20.92 --> 02:31:22.92
I'm stronger than that.

3001
02:31:22.92 --> 02:31:26.92
And then.

3002
02:31:26.92 --> 02:31:30.92
The next court date.

3003
02:31:30.92 --> 02:31:32.92
I wound up getting an.

3004
02:31:32.92 --> 02:31:33.92
An adjournment.

3005
02:31:33.92 --> 02:31:37.92
Again, because they didn't have a case against me and again, it got pushed back while the DA

3006
02:31:37.92 --> 02:31:42.92
continued to try and build it until finally in December of 2012.

3007
02:31:42.92 --> 02:31:50.92
They contacted my lawyer and said to appear in court on Friday, December 14th, when the entire case was dismissed.

3008
02:31:50.92 --> 02:31:52.92
Yeah.

3009
02:31:52.92 --> 02:31:54.92
And.

3010
02:31:54.92 --> 02:31:58.92
Yeah.

3011
02:31:58.92 --> 02:31:59.92
You.

3012
02:31:59.92 --> 02:32:02.92
At that point, you know, you kind of get back on track.

3013
02:32:02.92 --> 02:32:03.92
Yeah.

3014
02:32:03.92 --> 02:32:04.92
And.

3015
02:32:04.92 --> 02:32:06.92
Your teaching jiu jitsu, like you said.

3016
02:32:06.92 --> 02:32:10.92
And there's a good quote here when you're teaching jitsu after you had the incident.

3017
02:32:10.92 --> 02:32:18.92
Yeah, at Webster Hall and one of the parents said, you know, so here he comes back to start teaching the kids class again after he's been all over the front page of all the papers.

3018
02:32:18.92 --> 02:32:24.92
Everybody's looking at me like, oh, I walked in the academy and like every half the people were like super happy to see me in there.

3019
02:32:24.92 --> 02:32:29.92
They have looked at me like just like a gunslinger just walked it like I was like, you know,

3020
02:32:29.92 --> 02:32:31.92
fucking wild west.

3021
02:32:31.92 --> 02:32:39.92
One of the moms, one of the moms was quoted as saying, well, at least I know my kid isn't getting taught jiu jitsu by a pussy.

3022
02:32:39.92 --> 02:32:40.92
Yeah.

3023
02:32:40.92 --> 02:32:41.92
Yeah.

3024
02:32:41.92 --> 02:32:45.92
And that was what that fucking baby has allowed.

3025
02:32:45.92 --> 02:32:52.92
And yet, there's still, um, there's still hard times because at this point, you're losing custody your kids.

3026
02:32:52.92 --> 02:32:53.92
Yeah.

3027
02:32:53.92 --> 02:33:06.92
And that was, you know, that's, you know, I got to tell you, I mean, that that has been the biggest trial and tribulation I've dealt with.

3028
02:33:06.92 --> 02:33:21.92
And obviously I've dealt with many, but, you know, especially someone who didn't really have responsible people like really raising me, you know,

3029
02:33:21.92 --> 02:33:30.92
I, it really hurts to not be there for your kids every day, you know, because I really, I used to cherish those moments more than anything.

3030
02:33:30.92 --> 02:33:35.92
I mean, just walking them to school in the morning and the little conversations we would have on the way to school.

3031
02:33:35.92 --> 02:33:44.92
And, you know, taking them to jiu jitsu and, you know, I really was the, this is the main care taker.

3032
02:33:44.92 --> 02:33:50.92
I was with them all day, you know, I did everything with them took them to the park, to museums, to this is a that's is.

3033
02:33:50.92 --> 02:33:57.92
And, and then have that taken away.

3034
02:33:57.92 --> 02:34:03.92
It's difficult to, again, to not start fucking up.

3035
02:34:03.92 --> 02:34:13.92
You know, especially when you're dealing with depression and all that shit and again, you know, it's just like, like I said, you know,

3036
02:34:13.92 --> 02:34:21.92
you know, have someone to love and to feel that that reciprocation and, you know,

3037
02:34:21.92 --> 02:34:27.92
feel needed, it's hard to not feel needed, you know.

3038
02:34:27.92 --> 02:34:39.92
But I, you know, I went through all the process of family courtness and then, you know, unfortunately they don't live with me full time, but I see them a lot.

3039
02:34:39.92 --> 02:34:52.92
And, you know, everybody knows who's been through a divorce and as kids, or I fortunately, I was never married to their mother and we, but anybody who's been in that situation knows it's not easy and it comes with a lot of challenges.

3040
02:34:52.92 --> 02:35:11.92
So now my challenges is to try to be involved with my kids' lives as much as I can and to try to give them some moral guidance and manhood guidance from a distance, you know.

3041
02:35:11.92 --> 02:35:15.92
And sadly, they didn't see, you know, me and their mother act like complete and toll.

3042
02:35:15.92 --> 02:35:21.92
So, averages towards the end of the relationship because people when they break up, they typically don't know how to act or behave.

3043
02:35:21.92 --> 02:35:23.92
Even in front of their kids.

3044
02:35:23.92 --> 02:35:37.92
So, but, you know, even all of this is made me a stronger and wiser person because I feel that it has again forced me to look at myself.

3045
02:35:37.92 --> 02:35:47.92
And, you have choices in every situation, how you're going to react and how you're, you know, what you're going to do.

3046
02:35:47.92 --> 02:35:52.92
And now I really think about the consequences of everything.

3047
02:35:52.92 --> 02:36:05.92
I know I can't just react, explosively if somebody does or says something to me on the street because I know that that could cause me my freedom.

3048
02:36:05.92 --> 02:36:11.92
It could cause that my kids, their father could cause my wife or husband.

3049
02:36:11.92 --> 02:36:21.92
So, you know, even losing my kids has been a learning experience that I hope.

3050
02:36:21.92 --> 02:36:33.92
God forbid they ever, you know, wind up with kids and separated in this and that, but hopefully even this bad stuff can help them become better men and smarter men,

3051
02:36:33.92 --> 02:36:38.92
and hopefully better smarter than I was.

3052
02:36:38.92 --> 02:36:51.92
You know, and I just try to believe really in the end-love wins, you know.

3053
02:36:51.92 --> 02:37:02.92
Yeah, there's to one more thing that you had to overcome in the book.

3054
02:37:02.92 --> 02:37:15.92
And, you know, sometimes, man, I just read a big chunk of the books that I'm reviewing because it's just a, the way it's written and the way it goes together and the story that it tells,

3055
02:37:15.92 --> 02:37:20.92
I just don't really want to change and I just want to put it out there.

3056
02:37:20.92 --> 02:37:26.92
So, I'm kind of going to do that right here.

3057
02:37:26.92 --> 02:37:39.92
After all the madness in my life and the recent drama surrounding Webster Hall, my arrest losing my kids, starting a new relationship, getting my kids back in my life and dealing with all the drama of family court.

3058
02:37:39.92 --> 02:37:43.92
My mom was stricken with terminal cancer.

3059
02:37:43.92 --> 02:37:50.92
After a major operation in what seemed like a recovery, things took a turn for the worse.

3060
02:37:50.92 --> 02:37:59.92
And through it all, she remained supportive in my battle for my kids, and I started spending a lot more time with her.

3061
02:37:59.92 --> 02:38:03.92
It's fucked up when you know your mom or dad is dying.

3062
02:38:03.92 --> 02:38:12.92
You go through your whole life with all the baggage and shit that they put on you and all the shit in the world and your friends put on you.

3063
02:38:12.92 --> 02:38:22.92
And then there comes a time when you realize you have to put it all down and just let it all go.

3064
02:38:22.92 --> 02:38:26.92
I was with her as much as possible during the last few months.

3065
02:38:26.92 --> 02:38:29.92
We spent more time together than we had in years.

3066
02:38:29.92 --> 02:38:36.92
We even left the city one day just a month before she died to spend some time at a horse stable.

3067
02:38:36.92 --> 02:38:41.92
She loved horses and she hadn't been around them since she was a child.

3068
02:38:41.92 --> 02:38:46.92
She said it was the most beautiful day in her entire life.

3069
02:38:46.92 --> 02:38:52.92
And later she spent the night and then the next three nights in my apartment.

3070
02:38:52.92 --> 02:38:58.92
We had such a good time that she completely forgot to take her pain medication.

3071
02:38:58.92 --> 02:39:03.92
I hope I can face death with as much dignity.

3072
02:39:03.92 --> 02:39:08.92
The way she has handled it, I've never seen a brave person in my life.

3073
02:39:08.92 --> 02:39:12.92
She makes all the men I know look like cowards.

3074
02:39:12.92 --> 02:39:17.92
Sadly, she only saw my kids twice during her last few months.

3075
02:39:17.92 --> 02:39:23.92
But the time that they spent together was amazing and very meaningful and picked up her spirits.

3076
02:39:23.92 --> 02:39:24.92
And I don't know.

3077
02:39:24.92 --> 02:39:31.92
And I know that she took great comfort in the fact that I'm finally in a place in my life where things are coming together in a positive way.

3078
02:39:31.92 --> 02:39:37.92
I just wish she could have been here with us longer.

3079
02:39:37.92 --> 02:39:46.92
She died Monday, June 15, 2015.

3080
02:39:46.92 --> 02:39:52.92
At the funeral, her ashes were carried out and placed on a table.

3081
02:39:52.92 --> 02:39:55.92
They weren't a box not meant to be buried.

3082
02:39:55.92 --> 02:40:00.92
A beautiful statue of a crying angel.

3083
02:40:00.92 --> 02:40:04.92
We all took part in reading from Bible verses.

3084
02:40:04.92 --> 02:40:08.92
I held onto my son Jonah and he cried quietly.

3085
02:40:08.92 --> 02:40:17.92
My son Harley stood behind me with my girlfriend trying to keep his composure as tears rolled down as face.

3086
02:40:17.92 --> 02:40:22.92
At the end of the service of slight drizzle of rain started again.

3087
02:40:22.92 --> 02:40:27.92
Whenever everyone was done consoling each other and people started walking away,

3088
02:40:27.92 --> 02:40:33.92
I looked at the box sitting on the table surrounded by flowers with the whole in the ground beside it.

3089
02:40:33.92 --> 02:40:48.92
Two cemetery workers arrived with shovels and a rake and I walked back and asked if I could cover her with soil myself as I had done for my father 13 years earlier.

3090
02:40:48.92 --> 02:40:55.92
I explained that I didn't feel right about someone who didn't know my mother covering her with dirt.

3091
02:40:55.92 --> 02:40:58.92
They understood.

3092
02:40:58.92 --> 02:41:01.92
I think them.

3093
02:41:01.92 --> 02:41:05.92
I took the box with the angel off the table.

3094
02:41:05.92 --> 02:41:09.92
I kissed it. My son's kissed it.

3095
02:41:09.92 --> 02:41:14.92
And I got down on my knees and put it in the ground.

3096
02:41:14.92 --> 02:41:20.92
One of the cemetery workers handed me a shovel and I started to fill the hole.

3097
02:41:20.92 --> 02:41:24.92
My youngest son, who had been crying, came over next to me.

3098
02:41:24.92 --> 02:41:27.92
God on his knees and started to help me fill the hole with his hands.

3099
02:41:27.92 --> 02:41:32.92
Grabbing pieces of soil and putting them in, picking out rocks.

3100
02:41:32.92 --> 02:41:36.92
So none would damage her box as we filled it.

3101
02:41:36.92 --> 02:41:39.92
And his tears stopped.

3102
02:41:39.92 --> 02:41:43.92
I put down the shovel and we both finished by hand.

3103
02:41:43.92 --> 02:41:48.92
And then I raked the soil over and we padded down the earth with our hands.

3104
02:41:48.92 --> 02:41:52.92
And it was done.

3105
02:41:52.92 --> 02:41:59.92
They were so sad and so beautiful.

3106
02:41:59.92 --> 02:42:04.92
The next day was father's day.

3107
02:42:04.92 --> 02:42:08.92
When I started writing this book, I didn't know what the end was going to be.

3108
02:42:08.92 --> 02:42:15.92
Or what I wanted to say besides telling the story of my life and setting the record straight.

3109
02:42:15.92 --> 02:42:21.92
But now it's so obvious what is about.

3110
02:42:21.92 --> 02:42:23.92
Closure.

3111
02:42:40.92 --> 02:42:42.92
And that.

3112
02:42:47.92 --> 02:42:49.92
That wraps up the book.

3113
02:42:49.92 --> 02:42:53.92
And.

3114
02:42:53.92 --> 02:42:57.92
And.

3115
02:42:57.92 --> 02:43:04.92
Look, no one has lived a perfect life.

3116
02:43:04.92 --> 02:43:06.92
We've all made mistakes.

3117
02:43:06.92 --> 02:43:09.92
We've all done things that can't be undone.

3118
02:43:09.92 --> 02:43:16.92
And we've gone places that we should not have gone.

3119
02:43:16.92 --> 02:43:23.92
But we all have the opportunity to redeem ourselves.

3120
02:43:23.92 --> 02:43:26.92
And it starts with confessing.

3121
02:43:26.92 --> 02:43:28.92
What we've done, it starts with owning it.

3122
02:43:28.92 --> 02:43:35.92
And then getting on the right path and staying on the right path.

3123
02:43:35.92 --> 02:43:39.92
And staying on that path.

3124
02:43:39.92 --> 02:43:41.92
The correct path.

3125
02:43:41.92 --> 02:43:43.92
It takes discipline.

3126
02:43:43.92 --> 02:43:46.92
And it takes humility. And it takes courage.

3127
02:43:46.92 --> 02:43:51.92
And it's hard.

3128
02:43:51.92 --> 02:43:54.92
But.

3129
02:43:54.92 --> 02:44:00.92
What is the other choice?

3130
02:44:00.92 --> 02:44:02.92
What else can we do?

3131
02:44:02.92 --> 02:44:06.92
Let the darkness completely consume us.

3132
02:44:06.92 --> 02:44:15.92
We've.

3133
02:44:15.92 --> 02:44:18.92
For instant gratification wherever we can find it.

3134
02:44:18.92 --> 02:44:21.92
Be overtaken.

3135
02:44:21.92 --> 02:44:25.92
By temptation.

3136
02:44:25.92 --> 02:44:29.92
And vice.

3137
02:44:29.92 --> 02:44:34.92
No.

3138
02:44:34.92 --> 02:44:37.92
That's struggle with all these things.

3139
02:44:37.92 --> 02:44:38.92
They're caught.

3140
02:44:38.92 --> 02:44:42.92
They're drowning.

3141
02:44:42.92 --> 02:44:55.92
They're folding under the weight of pain and suffering and misery and addiction.

3142
02:44:55.92 --> 02:45:02.92
And they ask me what I think.

3143
02:45:02.92 --> 02:45:14.92
And what Harley proves is that you are better than that.

3144
02:45:14.92 --> 02:45:15.92
You are better.

3145
02:45:15.92 --> 02:45:19.92
And you can triumph over these dark forces.

3146
02:45:19.92 --> 02:45:21.92
You can become better.

3147
02:45:21.92 --> 02:45:24.92
You can be better.

3148
02:45:24.92 --> 02:45:26.92
For yourself.

3149
02:45:26.92 --> 02:45:30.92
And for the people around you.

3150
02:45:30.92 --> 02:45:35.92
For all of us.

3151
02:45:35.92 --> 02:45:40.92
Hold the line.

3152
02:45:40.92 --> 02:45:46.92
Stay clean.

3153
02:45:46.92 --> 02:45:55.92
And never surrender.

3154
02:45:55.92 --> 02:46:09.92
You overcame a lot of stuff, man.

3155
02:46:09.92 --> 02:46:11.92
I have.

3156
02:46:11.92 --> 02:46:16.92
Still trying.

3157
02:46:16.92 --> 02:46:21.92
Yeah.

3158
02:46:21.92 --> 02:46:28.92
I guess everyone is.

3159
02:46:28.92 --> 02:46:32.92
This is the time in the podcast.

3160
02:46:32.92 --> 02:46:39.92
Why we have that go here.

3161
02:46:39.92 --> 02:46:42.92
Because we got the chance to decompress a little bit.

3162
02:46:42.92 --> 02:46:43.92
Yes.

3163
02:46:43.92 --> 02:46:46.92
He gets to ask a couple questions.

3164
02:46:46.92 --> 02:46:53.92
They're playing my little quick.

3165
02:46:53.92 --> 02:46:56.92
Yeah.

3166
02:46:56.92 --> 02:46:59.92
You can see when I walk.

3167
02:46:59.92 --> 02:47:00.92
Yeah.

3168
02:47:00.92 --> 02:47:03.92
You thought it was a compound fracture.

3169
02:47:03.92 --> 02:47:05.92
Yeah.

3170
02:47:05.92 --> 02:47:06.92
Yeah.

3171
02:47:06.92 --> 02:47:08.92
I was wondering how it was bone.

3172
02:47:08.92 --> 02:47:10.92
Makes sense.

3173
02:47:10.92 --> 02:47:17.92
Yeah.

3174
02:47:17.92 --> 02:47:23.92
You can get straight up stabbed.

3175
02:47:23.92 --> 02:47:24.92
Yeah.

3176
02:47:24.92 --> 02:47:27.92
Stuff hanging out.

3177
02:47:27.92 --> 02:47:28.92
Yeah.

3178
02:47:28.92 --> 02:47:29.92
What's next?

3179
02:47:29.92 --> 02:47:32.92
Oh, my head is all for you.

3180
02:47:32.92 --> 02:47:33.92
Okay.

3181
02:47:33.92 --> 02:47:34.92
So clear.

3182
02:47:34.92 --> 02:47:35.92
Here's your eyeball.

3183
02:47:35.92 --> 02:47:38.92
Thanks.

3184
02:47:38.92 --> 02:47:41.92
Yeah.

3185
02:47:41.92 --> 02:47:47.92
That's why I'm so sketchy when it comes to, like as much as I, you know, I got admitted.

3186
02:47:47.92 --> 02:47:49.92
That's it was fun.

3187
02:47:49.92 --> 02:47:52.92
I like a good adrenaline.

3188
02:47:52.92 --> 02:47:53.92
It's done.

3189
02:47:53.92 --> 02:47:57.92
A good violent confrontation.

3190
02:47:57.92 --> 02:47:58.92
A good fight.

3191
02:47:58.92 --> 02:48:03.92
It is fun.

3192
02:48:03.92 --> 02:48:07.92
It's like life and death.

3193
02:48:07.92 --> 02:48:11.92
You know, so it's like, you know, like I said, you know, like I had that one fight and

3194
02:48:11.92 --> 02:48:17.92
California where I'm running into a mob of all these dudes, like, you know, I was high off that shit for like a week.

3195
02:48:17.92 --> 02:48:20.92
My adrenaline was like, I felt like I could fucking.

3196
02:48:20.92 --> 02:48:22.92
Yeah.

3197
02:48:22.92 --> 02:48:28.92
And then like a week later, I'm like, what the fuck was that shit?

3198
02:48:28.92 --> 02:48:29.92
Yeah.

3199
02:48:29.92 --> 02:48:34.92
As much as, you know, yeah, it was fun.

3200
02:48:34.92 --> 02:48:38.92
How often do you get to have a street fight anymore, you know, shit, especially at my age?

3201
02:48:38.92 --> 02:48:39.92
But three guys.

3202
02:48:39.92 --> 02:48:40.92
Yeah.

3203
02:48:40.92 --> 02:48:41.92
That's a nice full-time.

3204
02:48:41.92 --> 02:48:43.92
But it was all the other shit, all the fucking ripple effects that came one way or like fuck.

3205
02:48:43.92 --> 02:48:44.92
I mean, I see my kids.

3206
02:48:44.92 --> 02:48:45.92
Fuck.

3207
02:48:45.92 --> 02:48:50.92
I may be in jail, fuck, over the next three years, like fucking, you know, protecting my ass from bubbles over here.

3208
02:48:50.92 --> 02:48:51.92
Yeah.

3209
02:48:51.92 --> 02:48:54.92
You know, like fucking, you know, the whole shit was like, damn, man.

3210
02:48:54.92 --> 02:48:56.92
Okay, we forget we just all get along.

3211
02:48:56.92 --> 02:49:01.92
Okay, we all just have a street fight, you know, just like, can we all just have a street fight?

3212
02:49:01.92 --> 02:49:04.92
Get on with our shit, you know.

3213
02:49:04.92 --> 02:49:07.92
But, you know, shit happens.

3214
02:49:07.92 --> 02:49:09.92
Yeah, we're gonna do, man.

3215
02:49:09.92 --> 02:49:11.92
Yeah, we put everything into perspective.

3216
02:49:11.92 --> 02:49:15.92
The whole getting into street fights doesn't seem quite as dope.

3217
02:49:15.92 --> 02:49:16.92
Yeah.

3218
02:49:16.92 --> 02:49:19.92
You know, it's, it changes when you got responsibility.

3219
02:49:19.92 --> 02:49:21.92
Yeah, that's the thing.

3220
02:49:21.92 --> 02:49:22.92
The responsibility.

3221
02:49:22.92 --> 02:49:23.92
Yeah.

3222
02:49:23.92 --> 02:49:26.92
And he's speaking or responsibility.

3223
02:49:26.92 --> 02:49:27.92
He's speaking of responsibility.

3224
02:49:27.92 --> 02:49:29.92
We're not getting any younger.

3225
02:49:29.92 --> 02:49:32.92
So we'll talk about on it first, as always.

3226
02:49:32.92 --> 02:49:37.92
So on it, supplements, you know, you know, but on it.

3227
02:49:37.92 --> 02:49:38.92
No.

3228
02:49:38.92 --> 02:49:39.92
Most people don't use to know about on it.

3229
02:49:39.92 --> 02:49:40.92
Oh, and the West Coast, they do.

3230
02:49:40.92 --> 02:49:43.92
I think that's how you motherfuckers are so big, because you're on it.

3231
02:49:43.92 --> 02:49:45.92
Yeah, I need to get so much shit.

3232
02:49:45.92 --> 02:49:46.92
I need to get out of my head.

3233
02:49:46.92 --> 02:49:47.92
I need to get out of it.

3234
02:49:47.92 --> 02:49:48.92
Yeah, I need to get out of it.

3235
02:49:48.92 --> 02:49:49.92
Yeah, I love my head.

3236
02:49:49.92 --> 02:49:50.92
Yeah, what the fuck is up with on it?

3237
02:49:50.92 --> 02:49:53.92
Yeah, actually true, but here in India, and that's what I thought too,

3238
02:49:53.92 --> 02:49:56.92
with supplements, where it's like, yeah, it takes up a month to get you big.

3239
02:49:56.92 --> 02:49:58.92
I found that that's not necessarily the case.

3240
02:49:58.92 --> 02:50:00.92
So the supplements that I take that we take.

3241
02:50:00.92 --> 02:50:01.92
Mm-hmm.

3242
02:50:01.92 --> 02:50:04.92
They're for like, you got a suitcase with some enemy.

3243
02:50:04.92 --> 02:50:06.92
I'll get you out of it.

3244
02:50:06.92 --> 02:50:07.92
I'll get you out of it.

3245
02:50:07.92 --> 02:50:09.92
I'm getting on it, motherfucker.

3246
02:50:09.92 --> 02:50:11.92
I've been on another shit.

3247
02:50:11.92 --> 02:50:12.92
I'm gonna get on it.

3248
02:50:12.92 --> 02:50:14.92
This is, this is stuff that's good.

3249
02:50:14.92 --> 02:50:15.92
This is legal.

3250
02:50:15.92 --> 02:50:18.92
I want, I want you to be on the right stuff,

3251
02:50:18.92 --> 02:50:20.92
that's what you're talking about.

3252
02:50:20.92 --> 02:50:21.92
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3253
02:50:21.92 --> 02:50:22.92
Move it towards the lights.

3254
02:50:22.92 --> 02:50:24.92
Yeah, the light is on it.

3255
02:50:24.92 --> 02:50:24.92
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3256
02:50:24.92 --> 02:50:26.92
This is the way for the darkness.

3257
02:50:26.92 --> 02:50:27.92
Yes.

3258
02:50:27.92 --> 02:50:29.92
But you can do Jinyan Hall like you get, for example,

3259
02:50:29.92 --> 02:50:33.92
the ones that I take feet now,

3260
02:50:33.92 --> 02:50:34.92
this krill oil.

3261
02:50:34.92 --> 02:50:35.92
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3262
02:50:35.92 --> 02:50:37.92
For inflammation and this is your life.

3263
02:50:37.92 --> 02:50:38.92
Exactly, right?

3264
02:50:38.92 --> 02:50:39.92
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3265
02:50:39.92 --> 02:50:40.92
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3266
02:50:40.92 --> 02:50:43.92
So the, so I know it is like a real reputable company that,

3267
02:50:43.92 --> 02:50:45.92
like you know you're getting,

3268
02:50:45.92 --> 02:50:47.92
because right, you can get supplements.

3269
02:50:47.92 --> 02:50:50.92
Yeah, you get it like fiddle,

3270
02:50:50.92 --> 02:50:52.92
they say crill and you're getting like fucking rot oil.

3271
02:50:52.92 --> 02:50:53.92
Yeah, right?

3272
02:50:53.92 --> 02:50:56.92
Yeah, this match point or oil, this is shit, you know?

3273
02:50:56.92 --> 02:50:57.92
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3274
02:50:57.92 --> 02:50:59.92
And they're like, yeah, there's crill oil here.

3275
02:50:59.92 --> 02:51:00.92
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3276
02:51:00.92 --> 02:51:02.92
But the rest of it's all vitamin E gel.

3277
02:51:02.92 --> 02:51:03.92
Yes, exactly right.

3278
02:51:03.92 --> 02:51:04.92
So this is on it.

3279
02:51:04.92 --> 02:51:06.92
It's like known to be the best.

3280
02:51:06.92 --> 02:51:09.92
I'm gonna have to get down, actually.

3281
02:51:09.92 --> 02:51:11.92
I'll be the main guy.

3282
02:51:11.92 --> 02:51:14.92
His, like he has extensive background and like,

3283
02:51:14.92 --> 02:51:16.92
uptake, you know how like,

3284
02:51:16.92 --> 02:51:21.92
You can get calcium supplement, but that supplement won't deliver the uptake so your body

3285
02:51:21.92 --> 02:51:24.72
doesn't get even breaking it down or absorbing it.

3286
02:51:24.72 --> 02:51:25.72
Yeah, it's exactly that.

3287
02:51:25.72 --> 02:51:28.72
So there's only still a lot of different vitamins and all that shit.

3288
02:51:28.72 --> 02:51:32.72
I try to get all my vitamins through food.

3289
02:51:32.72 --> 02:51:33.72
Yes.

3290
02:51:33.72 --> 02:51:35.72
If I can, you know, that's optimal.

3291
02:51:35.72 --> 02:51:36.72
Yeah.

3292
02:51:36.72 --> 02:51:41.52
So that's kind of the point where like, yeah, when you get it with food, you know that you're

3293
02:51:41.52 --> 02:51:42.52
going to get the best uptake.

3294
02:51:42.52 --> 02:51:46.52
But for the most part, you know, if you're getting your, you know, I don't know,

3295
02:51:46.52 --> 02:51:51.40
protein from soybeans or something, you know, I don't get as much protein as you animals

3296
02:51:51.40 --> 02:51:52.40
over here.

3297
02:51:52.40 --> 02:51:53.40
I'm a vegetarian.

3298
02:51:53.40 --> 02:51:57.24
I have been since like 82 or something like that.

3299
02:51:57.24 --> 02:52:02.40
What I also think is one of the reasons why I managed to maintain a certain level

3300
02:52:02.40 --> 02:52:04.68
of health and sanity.

3301
02:52:04.68 --> 02:52:09.76
I think that that actually helped me the wheatgrass.

3302
02:52:09.76 --> 02:52:12.76
Yeah, we're so weak.

3303
02:52:12.76 --> 02:52:15.76
Hey, hey, everyone's wishing to podcast.

3304
02:52:15.76 --> 02:52:18.88
You're shooting up heroin, make sure you're safe here, we're grass.

3305
02:52:18.88 --> 02:52:21.16
And always wear a condom when you're shooting.

3306
02:52:21.16 --> 02:52:22.16
Yeah.

3307
02:52:22.16 --> 02:52:24.16
Yeah, good lord.

3308
02:52:24.16 --> 02:52:27.64
But yeah, figure that's optimal from the food.

3309
02:52:27.64 --> 02:52:33.64
But on it, like they do a good job in knowing like the optimum way to uptake the nutrients.

3310
02:52:33.64 --> 02:52:34.64
Yeah, found that out.

3311
02:52:34.64 --> 02:52:35.64
Nice.

3312
02:52:35.64 --> 02:52:38.000
That's a, you know, that's a good one.

3313
02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:39.28
You know, one of the reasons.

3314
02:52:39.28 --> 02:52:43.68
So we do krill oil, strong bone new when I just started jockel always does it for your

3315
02:52:43.68 --> 02:52:44.68
joints.

3316
02:52:44.68 --> 02:52:47.44
Did you get to, you know, now I have some joint issues.

3317
02:52:47.44 --> 02:52:48.44
Yeah, man.

3318
02:52:48.44 --> 02:52:49.44
After a while, that's how.

3319
02:52:49.44 --> 02:52:50.44
Yeah.

3320
02:52:50.44 --> 02:52:52.24
Yeah, and the krill oil helps a lot.

3321
02:52:52.24 --> 02:52:53.24
A lot, a lot.

3322
02:52:53.24 --> 02:52:54.64
I'd say that's the number one.

3323
02:52:54.64 --> 02:52:55.64
I think so.

3324
02:52:55.64 --> 02:52:56.64
That I would recommend.

3325
02:52:56.64 --> 02:53:01.000
I'd recommend a few more other things too, but just for different reasons.

3326
02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.52
Like they have this one of warrior bars, buff well, you're vegetarian.

3327
02:53:03.52 --> 02:53:04.52
So never mind a problem.

3328
02:53:04.52 --> 02:53:05.52
It's buffalo meat.

3329
02:53:05.52 --> 02:53:06.52
Buffalo meat.

3330
02:53:06.52 --> 02:53:08.40
Made, you know, like they make not necessarily.

3331
02:53:08.40 --> 02:53:10.000
Well, I know buffalo meat better for you.

3332
02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.44
I mean, I know, you know, it doesn't have all the fucking hormones.

3333
02:53:12.44 --> 02:53:16.44
I don't know if you could necessarily offer it to the gods, which god you're offering

3334
02:53:16.44 --> 02:53:17.44
it to.

3335
02:53:17.44 --> 02:53:19.44
I mean, I'm sure there's some Native American god you could offer.

3336
02:53:19.44 --> 02:53:21.44
There's a lot of god there.

3337
02:53:21.44 --> 02:53:23.44
I mean, the warrior bars, it's good.

3338
02:53:23.44 --> 02:53:24.44
I know that much.

3339
02:53:24.44 --> 02:53:25.44
Yeah.

3340
02:53:25.44 --> 02:53:27.44
You know, I'm just going to feel him do.

3341
02:53:27.44 --> 02:53:28.44
There's enough gods to pick from.

3342
02:53:28.44 --> 02:53:29.44
Yeah, sure.

3343
02:53:29.44 --> 02:53:31.44
I think I've got plenty of.

3344
02:53:31.44 --> 02:53:32.44
Yeah.

3345
02:53:32.44 --> 02:53:36.44
I think they'd be down for the shrimp tech as well, which is stuff.

3346
02:53:36.44 --> 02:53:38.44
It's made from mushroom.

3347
02:53:38.44 --> 02:53:39.44
Can you know the mushroom name?

3348
02:53:39.44 --> 02:53:40.44
Different kind of mushroom.

3349
02:53:40.44 --> 02:53:42.44
Yeah, you're a muster.

3350
02:53:42.44 --> 02:53:43.44
Yeah.

3351
02:53:43.44 --> 02:53:44.44
Yeah.

3352
02:53:44.44 --> 02:53:45.44
Yeah.

3353
02:53:45.44 --> 02:53:47.44
When he boards started this out, good.

3354
02:53:47.44 --> 02:53:51.44
But it's just to help you uptake oxygen when you go athletic.

3355
02:53:51.44 --> 02:53:52.44
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3356
02:53:52.44 --> 02:53:53.44
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3357
02:53:53.44 --> 02:53:58.44
You know, you need to, especially as you get older, your oxygen doesn't travel as well.

3358
02:53:58.44 --> 02:53:59.44
Yeah.

3359
02:53:59.44 --> 02:54:05.44
I just realize there's no greater joy for echo than when someone's on the podcast as a guest

3360
02:54:05.44 --> 02:54:07.44
that wants to know about the stuff.

3361
02:54:07.44 --> 02:54:08.44
He's Paul Blot.

3362
02:54:08.44 --> 02:54:09.44
He's good.

3363
02:54:09.44 --> 02:54:13.44
That'll ask me at, like, when I'm training or whatever they look at, what's the real oil?

3364
02:54:13.44 --> 02:54:18.44
Is that like, you know, you're thinking, and then, bro, I'm like, doing a sales pitch to my food.

3365
02:54:18.44 --> 02:54:19.44
It seems like it anyway.

3366
02:54:19.44 --> 02:54:20.44
You get him a crills shirt.

3367
02:54:20.44 --> 02:54:21.44
Yeah.

3368
02:54:21.44 --> 02:54:22.44
You're a scum.

3369
02:54:22.44 --> 02:54:23.44
I'm gonna hit.

3370
02:54:23.44 --> 02:54:24.44
I asked me about the krill oil.

3371
02:54:24.44 --> 02:54:25.44
No, don't.

3372
02:54:25.44 --> 02:54:26.44
Don't.

3373
02:54:26.44 --> 02:54:26.44
Don't.

3374
02:54:26.44 --> 02:54:27.44
Don't.

3375
02:54:27.44 --> 02:54:29.44
I'm telling you, in the mornings, I told this start before.

3376
02:54:29.44 --> 02:54:30.44
Jocard, it plenty times.

3377
02:54:30.44 --> 02:54:34.44
In the mornings, my daughter, she's, she's like, for now, but, you know, when she's like three,

3378
02:54:34.44 --> 02:54:37.44
she'd come in, which is the only person in the world that hasn't heard the story.

3379
02:54:37.44 --> 02:54:38.44
It's hardly fun.

3380
02:54:38.44 --> 02:54:39.44
Yeah.

3381
02:54:39.44 --> 02:54:40.44
But he's about to hear it.

3382
02:54:40.44 --> 02:54:41.44
No one's gonna stop for now.

3383
02:54:41.44 --> 02:54:42.44
He did it all.

3384
02:54:42.44 --> 02:54:43.44
He did it all.

3385
02:54:43.44 --> 02:54:45.44
You and me talk for three hours right there?

3386
02:54:45.44 --> 02:54:48.44
Echo gets to talk for an hour now about three hours.

3387
02:54:48.44 --> 02:54:49.44
Go.

3388
02:54:49.44 --> 02:54:51.44
Yeah, you told me story, and that was a good answer.

3389
02:54:51.44 --> 02:54:52.44
Go.

3390
02:54:52.44 --> 02:54:53.44
Here we go.

3391
02:54:53.44 --> 02:54:54.44
Anyway, she'd jump.

3392
02:54:54.44 --> 02:54:56.44
She'd she'd wake me up, jump from my back.

3393
02:54:56.44 --> 02:54:58.44
So, you know, now I gotta stand up.

3394
02:54:58.44 --> 02:55:02.44
Out of bed, cold sore from whatever.

3395
02:55:02.44 --> 02:55:03.44
With a three year old, I'm at back.

3396
02:55:03.44 --> 02:55:06.44
And it's best if I gotta do the correct form to get up.

3397
02:55:06.44 --> 02:55:09.44
Otherwise, you know, you turn your back, you knees all that stuff.

3398
02:55:09.44 --> 02:55:13.44
After like, it was just under a weak, krill oil.

3399
02:55:13.44 --> 02:55:14.44
No factor.

3400
02:55:14.44 --> 02:55:15.44
It's like I was already warm.

3401
02:55:15.44 --> 02:55:17.44
That's the feeling.

3402
02:55:17.44 --> 02:55:19.44
You want some krill oil now?

3403
02:55:19.44 --> 02:55:20.44
I was just gonna interject.

3404
02:55:20.44 --> 02:55:24.44
I gotta give my father-in-law some props to me.

3405
02:55:24.44 --> 02:55:25.44
He rest in peace.

3406
02:55:25.44 --> 02:55:26.44
He turned me on to the krill.

3407
02:55:26.44 --> 02:55:27.44
Oh, right.

3408
02:55:27.44 --> 02:55:28.44
See, my father-in-law, right?

3409
02:55:28.44 --> 02:55:30.44
I mean, so the father-in-law's got what's up.

3410
02:55:30.44 --> 02:55:32.44
Father-in-law's, they've been around.

3411
02:55:32.44 --> 02:55:34.44
Yeah, they've been around a little longer than us.

3412
02:55:34.44 --> 02:55:35.44
Yeah, no, he turned me on.

3413
02:55:35.44 --> 02:55:41.44
And even though I am a vegetarian, I do take the fish or the krill oil and whatnot.

3414
02:55:41.44 --> 02:55:49.44
Because, you know what, I mean, look, I started off as a vegetarian for whatever spiritual

3415
02:55:49.44 --> 02:55:52.44
revisions and whatever health reasons.

3416
02:55:52.44 --> 02:55:59.44
Now, I believe it's best to have a mainly vegetarian diet.

3417
02:55:59.44 --> 02:56:04.44
But if my body starts saying, mother fuck, you need some fish.

3418
02:56:04.44 --> 02:56:08.44
Like, you are like about to drop dead if you don't get some serious proteins.

3419
02:56:08.44 --> 02:56:12.44
It's like, I will do what my body tells me to do.

3420
02:56:12.44 --> 02:56:17.44
I think humans are designed to be able to do vegetarian and meat.

3421
02:56:17.44 --> 02:56:19.44
That's why we have two different kinds of teeth.

3422
02:56:19.44 --> 02:56:25.44
You know, when we were hunter-gatherers, you know, you were gathering a lot more than you were hunting,

3423
02:56:25.44 --> 02:56:26.44
realistically.

3424
02:56:26.44 --> 02:56:28.44
Because hunting wasn't always easy.

3425
02:56:28.44 --> 02:56:30.44
You would have fucking spear, you know.

3426
02:56:30.44 --> 02:56:35.44
So, you know, I listen to my body a lot too and my body usually tells me to eat.

3427
02:56:35.44 --> 02:56:36.44
Okay.

3428
02:56:36.44 --> 02:56:39.44
You know, props.

3429
02:56:39.44 --> 02:56:40.44
Yep, total props.

3430
02:56:40.44 --> 02:56:45.44
Well, the good thing about the krill, whether this meat, however much this means.

3431
02:56:45.44 --> 02:56:48.44
How they harvest the krill is also, yes.

3432
02:56:48.44 --> 02:56:50.44
Yes, so how they do it, though, is good.

3433
02:56:50.44 --> 02:56:53.44
They use like eco-friendly chips.

3434
02:56:53.44 --> 02:56:55.44
You watch the video friendly shit.

3435
02:56:55.44 --> 02:56:56.44
Yeah, it's the crazy, it's the whole thing.

3436
02:56:56.44 --> 02:57:00.44
You can do it.

3437
02:57:00.44 --> 02:57:01.44
I can do it.

3438
02:57:01.44 --> 02:57:04.44
I can do it.

3439
02:57:04.44 --> 02:57:06.44
Not the go-friendly shit.

3440
02:57:06.44 --> 02:57:07.44
Fuck it.

3441
02:57:07.44 --> 02:57:10.44
I watched the video.

3442
02:57:10.44 --> 02:57:11.44
I watched the video.

3443
02:57:11.44 --> 02:57:12.44
Who's good?

3444
02:57:12.44 --> 02:57:12.44
Okay.

3445
02:57:12.44 --> 02:57:15.44
You just need that in your own podcast called The Echo on it.

3446
02:57:15.44 --> 02:57:16.44
I'm gonna.

3447
02:57:16.44 --> 02:57:17.44
I'm gonna.

3448
02:57:17.44 --> 02:57:20.44
People need to know, I think you got to fucking make your own line.

3449
02:57:20.44 --> 02:57:21.44
Echo oil.

3450
02:57:21.44 --> 02:57:22.44
Something.

3451
02:57:22.44 --> 02:57:23.44
I don't know.

3452
02:57:23.44 --> 02:57:24.44
I'm not.

3453
02:57:24.44 --> 02:57:25.44
I think they have an nail in that.

3454
02:57:25.44 --> 02:57:26.44
Sure.

3455
02:57:26.44 --> 02:57:27.44
All right, on it.

3456
02:57:27.44 --> 02:57:28.44
I'm gonna get on it.

3457
02:57:28.44 --> 02:57:29.44
Interesting.

3458
02:57:29.44 --> 02:57:30.44
Lee enough.

3459
02:57:30.44 --> 02:57:31.44
How your father-in-law turned out?

3460
02:57:31.44 --> 02:57:32.44
My father-in-law turned me on to it.

3461
02:57:32.44 --> 02:57:33.44
I didn't listen to him, by the way.

3462
02:57:33.44 --> 02:57:35.44
I only did it when Jockel was like, yeah, I take krill.

3463
02:57:35.44 --> 02:57:37.44
So I was like, okay, I'm gonna take krill on my father-in-law.

3464
02:57:37.44 --> 02:57:38.44
Yeah, shit.

3465
02:57:38.44 --> 02:57:39.44
Whatever.

3466
02:57:39.44 --> 02:57:40.44
Anyway.

3467
02:57:40.44 --> 02:57:41.44
Anyway.

3468
02:57:41.44 --> 02:57:42.44
On it.

3469
02:57:42.44 --> 02:57:43.44
.com slash Jockel.

3470
02:57:43.44 --> 02:57:46.44
That's how you can get 10% off of all your stuff, whatever you like.

3471
02:57:46.44 --> 02:57:48.44
Well, I'm just gonna ask him directly.

3472
02:57:48.44 --> 02:57:49.44
Get me the 10%.

3473
02:57:49.44 --> 02:57:50.44
Oh, it's like, yeah.

3474
02:57:50.44 --> 02:57:51.44
Yeah.

3475
02:57:51.44 --> 02:57:53.44
That's what I did in the beginning too.

3476
02:57:53.44 --> 02:57:54.44
Take krill oil.

3477
02:57:54.44 --> 02:57:55.44
Yeah.

3478
02:57:55.44 --> 02:57:58.44
Also, good way to support Amazon.

3479
02:57:58.44 --> 02:57:59.44
Click through.

3480
02:57:59.44 --> 02:58:01.44
So what all that is, you shop Amazon, right?

3481
02:58:01.44 --> 02:58:03.44
I guess I have.

3482
02:58:03.44 --> 02:58:04.44
Yeah.

3483
02:58:04.44 --> 02:58:05.44
Okay.

3484
02:58:05.44 --> 02:58:06.44
That's a, yeah.

3485
02:58:06.44 --> 02:58:08.44
You're the only person that had heard like the krill oil store.

3486
02:58:08.44 --> 02:58:11.000
Now you're the only person in the world that's not getting everything that

3487
02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:12.44
buy off of Amazon.

3488
02:58:12.44 --> 02:58:13.44
I live in the city.

3489
02:58:13.44 --> 02:58:14.44
I go to the store.

3490
02:58:14.44 --> 02:58:16.44
I guess it's different here.

3491
02:58:16.44 --> 02:58:17.44
We want it.

3492
02:58:17.44 --> 02:58:18.44
We go out.

3493
02:58:18.44 --> 02:58:19.44
Yeah.

3494
02:58:19.44 --> 02:58:20.44
Plus it's your get it.

3495
02:58:20.44 --> 02:58:21.44
You can walk.

3496
02:58:21.44 --> 02:58:22.44
Yeah.

3497
02:58:22.44 --> 02:58:23.44
Yeah.

3498
02:58:23.44 --> 02:58:24.44
You got yards.

3499
02:58:24.44 --> 02:58:25.44
Yeah.

3500
02:58:25.44 --> 02:58:26.44
You got.

3501
02:58:26.44 --> 02:58:27.44
And that's why we got you.

3502
02:58:27.44 --> 02:58:28.44
You got yards.

3503
02:58:28.44 --> 02:58:29.44
Fuck.

3504
02:58:29.44 --> 02:58:30.44
Yama.

3505
02:58:30.44 --> 02:58:31.44
Fuck it's all misery.

3506
02:58:31.44 --> 02:58:32.44
No winter.

3507
02:58:32.44 --> 02:58:33.44
Yeah.

3508
02:58:33.44 --> 02:58:35.44
It's as much as no.

3509
02:58:35.44 --> 02:58:36.44
Nothing.

3510
02:58:36.44 --> 02:58:37.44
You can study.

3511
02:58:37.44 --> 02:58:38.44
We have a winter.

3512
02:58:38.44 --> 02:58:39.44
Yeah.

3513
02:58:39.44 --> 02:58:40.44
You know he's from Hawaii, right?

3514
02:58:40.44 --> 02:58:41.44
Yeah.

3515
02:58:41.44 --> 02:58:42.44
So he's from Hawaii, right?

3516
02:58:42.44 --> 02:58:43.44
Yeah.

3517
02:58:43.44 --> 02:58:44.44
So he's from Hawaii, right?

3518
02:58:44.44 --> 02:58:45.44
Yeah.

3519
02:58:45.44 --> 02:58:46.44
He takes it from California.

3520
02:58:46.44 --> 02:58:47.44
He goes one step further.

3521
02:58:47.44 --> 02:58:48.44
Yeah.

3522
02:58:48.44 --> 02:58:49.44
My mom says that, oh yeah.

3523
02:58:49.44 --> 02:58:50.44
And the winter.

3524
02:58:50.44 --> 02:58:51.44
It rains a lot.

3525
02:58:51.44 --> 02:58:52.44
I don't even know.

3526
02:58:52.44 --> 02:58:54.44
I mean, it feeds the plants.

3527
02:58:54.44 --> 02:58:55.44
Yeah.

3528
02:58:55.44 --> 02:58:56.44
What is that?

3529
02:58:56.44 --> 02:58:57.44
You know?

3530
02:58:57.44 --> 02:58:59.44
Lessons of fucking mind soon.

3531
02:58:59.44 --> 02:59:00.44
I don't want to hear it.

3532
02:59:00.44 --> 02:59:01.44
Yeah, man.

3533
02:59:01.44 --> 02:59:02.44
I hear that.

3534
02:59:02.44 --> 02:59:03.44
That things.

3535
02:59:03.44 --> 02:59:04.44
But yeah.

3536
02:59:04.44 --> 02:59:05.44
So Amazon.

3537
02:59:05.44 --> 02:59:06.44
All right.

3538
02:59:06.44 --> 02:59:07.44
That's where it is.

3539
02:59:07.44 --> 02:59:09.44
All these things you're during the mehons.

3540
02:59:09.44 --> 02:59:13.44
In the event of you shopping on Amazon and it's good for everyone.

3541
02:59:13.44 --> 02:59:15.44
Before you go to Emily, you click through the website.

3542
02:59:15.44 --> 02:59:16.44
Through all websites.

3543
02:59:16.44 --> 02:59:17.44
Your website.

3544
02:59:17.44 --> 02:59:18.44
Your website.

3545
02:59:18.44 --> 02:59:19.44
Yeah.

3546
02:59:19.44 --> 02:59:20.44
So it's like a little.

3547
02:59:20.44 --> 02:59:21.44
Yes.

3548
02:59:21.44 --> 02:59:23.44
I'm not saying, hey, thanks for referring.

3549
02:59:23.44 --> 02:59:24.44
You know, it's pretty dope.

3550
02:59:24.44 --> 02:59:25.44
That's pretty dope.

3551
02:59:25.44 --> 02:59:27.44
They give us a little bit a little piece of that.

3552
02:59:27.44 --> 02:59:28.44
Yeah.

3553
02:59:28.44 --> 02:59:29.44
And you know what it caught.

3554
02:59:29.44 --> 02:59:33.44
The cool thing is because you can set up things for, like, podcasts.

3555
02:59:33.44 --> 02:59:35.44
That's basically give me money.

3556
02:59:35.44 --> 02:59:36.44
Get, just give me money.

3557
02:59:36.44 --> 02:59:37.44
But yeah.

3558
02:59:37.44 --> 02:59:40.44
I don't really like asking people for money.

3559
02:59:40.44 --> 02:59:41.44
Yeah.

3560
02:59:41.44 --> 02:59:42.44
This is, you don't even.

3561
02:59:42.44 --> 02:59:42.44
It doesn't.

3562
02:59:42.44 --> 02:59:43.44
Your price doesn't go up.

3563
02:59:43.44 --> 02:59:45.44
It's actually in my book.

3564
02:59:45.44 --> 02:59:46.44
It's kind of a good way to stick it to the man.

3565
02:59:46.44 --> 02:59:49.44
Because Amazon got a kick a little bit down to the podcast.

3566
02:59:49.44 --> 02:59:50.44
Yeah.

3567
02:59:50.44 --> 02:59:53.44
But it's kind of not because you stick it to the man too.

3568
02:59:53.44 --> 02:59:54.44
Yeah.

3569
02:59:54.44 --> 02:59:55.44
I thought you were a wealthy man.

3570
02:59:55.44 --> 02:59:56.44
You know what I mean?

3571
02:59:56.44 --> 02:59:57.44
This is the way.

3572
02:59:57.44 --> 02:59:59.44
Kind of an ambiguous position.

3573
02:59:59.44 --> 03:00:01.44
I guess I'm proud of you.

3574
03:00:01.44 --> 03:00:02.44
So that's the root man.

3575
03:00:02.44 --> 03:00:03.44
I'm a good keeper.

3576
03:00:03.44 --> 03:00:04.44
It's a joke.

3577
03:00:04.44 --> 03:00:05.44
You're a fucking man.

3578
03:00:05.44 --> 03:00:06.44
Wait a minute.

3579
03:00:06.44 --> 03:00:07.44
I am a man.

3580
03:00:07.44 --> 03:00:07.44
Wait a minute.

3581
03:00:07.44 --> 03:00:08.44
I am a man.

3582
03:00:08.44 --> 03:00:08.44
I'm a man.

3583
03:00:08.44 --> 03:00:08.44
I'm a man.

3584
03:00:08.44 --> 03:00:09.44
I'm a man.

3585
03:00:09.44 --> 03:00:10.44
I'm a man.

3586
03:00:10.44 --> 03:00:11.44
I'm a man.

3587
03:00:11.44 --> 03:00:12.44
I'm a man.

3588
03:00:12.44 --> 03:00:13.44
I'm a man.

3589
03:00:13.44 --> 03:00:14.44
I'm a man.

3590
03:00:14.44 --> 03:00:15.44
I'm a man.

3591
03:00:15.44 --> 03:00:16.44
I'm a man.

3592
03:00:16.44 --> 03:00:17.44
I'm a man.

3593
03:00:17.44 --> 03:00:18.44
I'm a man.

3594
03:00:18.44 --> 03:00:20.44
But I mean either way, you know, when you do do do do do do do do do do do do.

3595
03:00:20.44 --> 03:00:21.44
I think it does benefit.

3596
03:00:21.44 --> 03:00:22.44
I'm a man.

3597
03:00:22.44 --> 03:00:23.44
I'm a man.

3598
03:00:23.44 --> 03:00:24.44
Because like a referral, you know.

3599
03:00:24.44 --> 03:00:25.44
I mean okay.

3600
03:00:25.44 --> 03:00:30.44
So you're saying that somebody might order something from another online retailer, but

3601
03:00:30.44 --> 03:00:33.44
instead someone says I'm going to support the podcast.

3602
03:00:33.44 --> 03:00:34.44
Yeah, fuck that support the podcast.

3603
03:00:34.44 --> 03:00:35.44
Yeah, yeah.

3604
03:00:35.44 --> 03:00:36.44
I like that.

3605
03:00:36.44 --> 03:00:37.44
Don't be a bunch of bitches.

3606
03:00:37.44 --> 03:00:39.44
You got to support the home team.

3607
03:00:39.44 --> 03:00:40.44
I feel the same way.

3608
03:00:40.44 --> 03:00:41.44
I feel the same way.

3609
03:00:41.44 --> 03:00:42.44
It's a part of the idea.

3610
03:00:42.44 --> 03:00:44.44
But I'm actually pretty cool.

3611
03:00:44.44 --> 03:00:45.44
Like that.

3612
03:00:45.44 --> 03:00:47.44
They'll offer everyone to want like little things.

3613
03:00:47.44 --> 03:00:51.44
I want to donate like you round up like let's say your thing costed like eight,

3614
03:00:51.44 --> 03:00:52.44
eighty nine.

3615
03:00:52.44 --> 03:00:55.44
You a year ago 11 cents to the next doll.

3616
03:00:55.44 --> 03:00:57.44
You don't donate that 11 cents to like something.

3617
03:00:57.44 --> 03:00:58.44
It's like chair anyway.

3618
03:00:58.44 --> 03:00:59.44
I'm not so good like that.

3619
03:00:59.44 --> 03:01:03.44
Anyway, you know, so put the podcast through the Amazon click through go to the

3620
03:01:03.44 --> 03:01:08.44
jocopotcast website, which is jocopotcast.com and click on the support or the Amazon

3621
03:01:08.44 --> 03:01:09.44
banner then do your shopping.

3622
03:01:09.44 --> 03:01:10.44
That's a good way.

3623
03:01:10.44 --> 03:01:12.44
Some people.

3624
03:01:12.44 --> 03:01:14.44
They'll do it and then like the little.

3625
03:01:14.44 --> 03:01:16.44
They'll get a screenshot of it and they'll sell it.

3626
03:01:16.44 --> 03:01:18.44
And they'll send it to me on Twitter.

3627
03:01:18.44 --> 03:01:20.44
Yeah, that's cool.

3628
03:01:20.44 --> 03:01:21.44
That is dope.

3629
03:01:21.44 --> 03:01:22.44
It's like confirmation.

3630
03:01:22.44 --> 03:01:23.44
Yeah.

3631
03:01:23.44 --> 03:01:25.44
And it's kind of like like they're saying hey, I'm supporting them.

3632
03:01:25.44 --> 03:01:29.44
But and I feel that like the literal direct support from them.

3633
03:01:29.44 --> 03:01:32.44
If you want to give that go Charles a good day as your support podcast.

3634
03:01:32.44 --> 03:01:34.44
So hit him with a little social media.

3635
03:01:34.44 --> 03:01:35.44
It's a little bit.

3636
03:01:35.44 --> 03:01:39.44
A lot of times they don't see like the price and I think they'll they'll just say,

3637
03:01:39.44 --> 03:01:41.44
Oh, it'll be a screenshot pretty ambiguous.

3638
03:01:41.44 --> 03:01:44.44
It could very well not even be them supporting the podcast necessarily.

3639
03:01:44.44 --> 03:01:47.44
Just I just feel like call. Yeah, just trying to tell you.

3640
03:01:47.44 --> 03:01:48.44
It works.

3641
03:01:48.44 --> 03:01:49.44
It works.

3642
03:01:49.44 --> 03:01:49.44
It works.

3643
03:01:49.44 --> 03:01:50.44
I like when they do that.

3644
03:01:50.44 --> 03:01:51.44
It makes me feel good.

3645
03:01:51.44 --> 03:01:52.44
I feel like they care.

3646
03:01:52.44 --> 03:01:53.44
Please.

3647
03:01:53.44 --> 03:01:53.44
Yeah.

3648
03:01:53.44 --> 03:01:54.44
Very easy.

3649
03:01:54.44 --> 03:01:54.44
Easy.

3650
03:01:54.44 --> 03:01:55.44
You know what?

3651
03:01:55.44 --> 03:01:59.44
You can subscribe to the podcast iTunes if you listen to it on iTunes and

3652
03:01:59.44 --> 03:02:02.44
Stitcher Google Play all these ones.

3653
03:02:02.44 --> 03:02:04.44
Yeah, that helps leave review if you're in the mood.

3654
03:02:04.44 --> 03:02:07.44
Like what Jocco's saying or hardly think like.

3655
03:02:07.44 --> 03:02:10.44
Yeah, I mean, you know, give a review on this specific one.

3656
03:02:10.44 --> 03:02:12.44
We have a YouTube channel.

3657
03:02:12.44 --> 03:02:16.44
If you have not subscribed to that, go ahead and subscribe to that.

3658
03:02:16.44 --> 03:02:22.44
If you like the video version of this podcast, but the excerpts, you know,

3659
03:02:22.44 --> 03:02:25.44
people been kind of giving me crap about saying excerpts a lot.

3660
03:02:25.44 --> 03:02:27.44
Do I say excerpts?

3661
03:02:27.44 --> 03:02:30.44
Do you say it a lot and you put your tone on it?

3662
03:02:30.44 --> 03:02:31.44
For real?

3663
03:02:31.44 --> 03:02:32.44
Yeah.

3664
03:02:32.44 --> 03:02:33.44
You don't you say.

3665
03:02:33.44 --> 03:02:34.44
I don't think you said it a lot.

3666
03:02:34.44 --> 03:02:36.44
No, you don't say, hey, you know, we've got some excerpts that we put on the,

3667
03:02:36.44 --> 03:02:39.44
You go, I made a couple excerpts.

3668
03:02:39.44 --> 03:02:43.44
Yeah, you go, you go escalation voice level 12.

3669
03:02:43.44 --> 03:02:45.44
Yeah, I guess.

3670
03:02:45.44 --> 03:02:47.44
Well, I think those, you're right.

3671
03:02:47.44 --> 03:02:48.44
Was that your idea?

3672
03:02:48.44 --> 03:02:49.44
excerpts?

3673
03:02:49.44 --> 03:02:49.44
Yeah.

3674
03:02:49.44 --> 03:02:50.44
There you go.

3675
03:02:50.44 --> 03:02:52.44
Yeah, because people don't want to watch.

3676
03:02:52.44 --> 03:02:54.44
Yeah, they're not going to watch three hours.

3677
03:02:54.44 --> 03:02:56.44
Yeah, three hour podcast.

3678
03:02:56.44 --> 03:02:59.44
If there's some point, oh, hey, Jocco, you cool thing with Harley Flanagan.

3679
03:02:59.44 --> 03:03:00.44
He was talking about this.

3680
03:03:00.44 --> 03:03:01.44
Yeah.

3681
03:03:01.44 --> 03:03:02.44
They want to see Harley for three minutes.

3682
03:03:02.44 --> 03:03:05.44
I want to send it to their buddy that they listen to Hardcore with.

3683
03:03:05.44 --> 03:03:06.44
Yeah.

3684
03:03:06.44 --> 03:03:11.44
They can't send them, hey, watch this three and a half hour podcast in the next during your lunch break.

3685
03:03:11.44 --> 03:03:12.44
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3686
03:03:12.44 --> 03:03:13.44
You can't do it.

3687
03:03:13.44 --> 03:03:14.44
You've got to send them a little clip.

3688
03:03:14.44 --> 03:03:16.44
Listen, Harley Flanagan talk about a street fight.

3689
03:03:16.44 --> 03:03:19.44
No, yeah, exactly right.

3690
03:03:19.44 --> 03:03:22.44
Maybe you should do a bunch of excerpts of yourself talking about on it.

3691
03:03:22.44 --> 03:03:23.44
An excerpt.

3692
03:03:23.44 --> 03:03:24.44
Let me say an excerpts.

3693
03:03:24.44 --> 03:03:27.44
Yeah, no, that's not very shareable.

3694
03:03:27.44 --> 03:03:28.44
But that was a good idea.

3695
03:03:28.44 --> 03:03:29.44
Thank you, Jocco, for that.

3696
03:03:29.44 --> 03:03:33.44
So if you want to see excerpts of random lessons, not random, they're not random.

3697
03:03:33.44 --> 03:03:34.44
Sorry, any mean random.

3698
03:03:34.44 --> 03:03:39.44
Exerpts of lessons, individual lessons selected selected from the podcast.

3699
03:03:39.44 --> 03:03:40.44
Boom, that's on YouTube.

3700
03:03:40.44 --> 03:03:51.44
And also, if you want one, tell Echo on social media, hey, make this time period on this podcast into an excerpt and put me on their two because that way I can harass him.

3701
03:03:51.44 --> 03:03:53.44
Now we can't do everything.

3702
03:03:53.44 --> 03:03:54.44
Everything go on.

3703
03:03:54.44 --> 03:03:55.44
Yeah, she's great.

3704
03:03:55.44 --> 03:03:56.44
Every single one.

3705
03:03:56.44 --> 03:03:59.44
But some of them, I see.

3706
03:03:59.44 --> 03:04:01.44
And I go, yeah, I go, come on, man.

3707
03:04:01.44 --> 03:04:02.44
Yeah.

3708
03:04:02.44 --> 03:04:04.44
I think we're going to do that one.

3709
03:04:04.44 --> 03:04:06.44
But you're not going to do that one.

3710
03:04:06.44 --> 03:04:07.44
You're going to do that one.

3711
03:04:07.44 --> 03:04:08.44
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3712
03:04:08.44 --> 03:04:09.44
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3713
03:04:09.44 --> 03:04:11.44
I think we're going to do that one.

3714
03:04:11.44 --> 03:04:14.44
But you're not going to do that one.

3715
03:04:14.44 --> 03:04:15.44
You're going to do that one.

3716
03:04:15.44 --> 03:04:18.44
That's the good.

3717
03:04:18.44 --> 03:04:19.44
We'll have T-shirts.

3718
03:04:19.44 --> 03:04:23.44
Because everybody, that's the good thing.

3719
03:04:23.44 --> 03:04:27.44
They want excerpts, but people also want half T-shirts for everything.

3720
03:04:27.44 --> 03:04:30.44
You know, like anything that some person share somewhere.

3721
03:04:30.44 --> 03:04:32.44
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3722
03:04:32.44 --> 03:04:34.44
Somebody finds something funny or interesting or whatever.

3723
03:04:34.44 --> 03:04:36.44
And it's a, we need to make that a new a teacher.

3724
03:04:36.44 --> 03:04:40.44
And then it gets escalated to a certain point where enough people ask for it.

3725
03:04:40.44 --> 03:04:42.44
And then we break down echo breaks down.

3726
03:04:42.44 --> 03:04:43.44
Yeah.

3727
03:04:43.44 --> 03:04:44.44
And it makes a teacher.

3728
03:04:44.44 --> 03:04:45.44
Sit up.

3729
03:04:45.44 --> 03:04:46.44
We're working.

3730
03:04:46.44 --> 03:04:47.44
It's like a.

3731
03:04:47.44 --> 03:04:48.44
Yeah, it's good.

3732
03:04:48.44 --> 03:04:50.44
You know, yeah, so the excerpts.

3733
03:04:50.44 --> 03:04:51.44
Good idea.

3734
03:04:51.44 --> 03:04:52.44
Thank you.

3735
03:04:52.44 --> 03:04:53.44
YouTube.

3736
03:04:53.44 --> 03:04:57.44
But if you do the request, if you're requesting that the, you know, what

3737
03:04:57.44 --> 03:05:02.44
that episode and what excerpts are you know, which, which excerpts are already on there.

3738
03:05:02.44 --> 03:05:04.44
Because sometimes people, hey, do this on.

3739
03:05:04.44 --> 03:05:06.44
And then it already be on there.

3740
03:05:06.44 --> 03:05:07.44
Just saying.

3741
03:05:07.44 --> 03:05:10.44
Yes, sometimes people tell me to do a book review.

3742
03:05:10.44 --> 03:05:11.44
And it's already been done.

3743
03:05:11.44 --> 03:05:12.44
Oh, yeah.

3744
03:05:12.44 --> 03:05:13.44
If you're doing a review.

3745
03:05:13.44 --> 03:05:13.44
You do a lot.

3746
03:05:13.44 --> 03:05:14.44
Yeah, I don't want.

3747
03:05:14.44 --> 03:05:16.44
Yeah, I get a lot of requests like that.

3748
03:05:16.44 --> 03:05:17.44
Yeah.

3749
03:05:17.44 --> 03:05:19.44
And then I have to, then I have to look up and see which one it is.

3750
03:05:19.44 --> 03:05:20.44
And then send it back to him and say,

3751
03:05:20.44 --> 03:05:21.44
Hey, man, I already did it on this one.

3752
03:05:21.44 --> 03:05:22.44
Yeah.

3753
03:05:22.44 --> 03:05:24.44
Actually, that's a good, like how we're going over today.

3754
03:05:24.44 --> 03:05:26.44
That's a good thing about how we put the,

3755
03:05:26.44 --> 03:05:28.44
the timestamps on all the subjects.

3756
03:05:28.44 --> 03:05:30.44
So, and that feeds into the search term.

3757
03:05:30.44 --> 03:05:32.44
So if you, you're like, hey, soon, so,

3758
03:05:32.44 --> 03:05:35.44
Jock podcast, art of war, it'll go.

3759
03:05:35.44 --> 03:05:36.44
Boom.

3760
03:05:36.44 --> 03:05:37.44
To that episode.

3761
03:05:37.44 --> 03:05:38.44
Yeah.

3762
03:05:38.44 --> 03:05:40.44
Twenty, twenty, three, you know, actually coming on top of this book.

3763
03:05:40.44 --> 03:05:42.44
There's a book out about HR right now for the bad brands.

3764
03:05:42.44 --> 03:05:43.44
Yeah.

3765
03:05:43.44 --> 03:05:46.44
And the reason I'm thinking of this is because one of my buddies,

3766
03:05:46.44 --> 03:05:51.44
who's into the podcast, who was a hardcore kid growing up.

3767
03:05:51.44 --> 03:05:55.44
And his name's not go, but he's a, he's a cop in LA.

3768
03:05:55.44 --> 03:05:57.44
And he was a cop in New York.

3769
03:05:57.44 --> 03:06:00.44
And so, I'm just thinking about that.

3770
03:06:00.44 --> 03:06:02.44
Like, here's a kid that grew up listening to the crowmags.

3771
03:06:02.44 --> 03:06:04.44
Who's been like, saying, get hardly art.

3772
03:06:04.44 --> 03:06:05.44
You got to get art.

3773
03:06:05.44 --> 03:06:06.44
He's a cop.

3774
03:06:06.44 --> 03:06:07.44
He's a bad ass cop.

3775
03:06:07.44 --> 03:06:09.44
And his, and his girls a cop too.

3776
03:06:09.44 --> 03:06:10.44
They're, they're getting that right.

3777
03:06:10.44 --> 03:06:12.44
I got a phrase that a cop's man.

3778
03:06:12.44 --> 03:06:12.44
Yeah.

3779
03:06:12.44 --> 03:06:13.44
I don't hate them all.

3780
03:06:13.44 --> 03:06:16.44
You know, you know, you know,

3781
03:06:16.44 --> 03:06:18.44
people they'll be like, hey, no, I don't eat cops.

3782
03:06:18.44 --> 03:06:19.44
I got friends that are cops.

3783
03:06:19.44 --> 03:06:20.44
Yeah.

3784
03:06:20.44 --> 03:06:24.44
Some of my best friends are blind.

3785
03:06:24.44 --> 03:06:25.44
Yeah.

3786
03:06:25.44 --> 03:06:28.44
Look, I got to picture me and a cop on my phone.

3787
03:06:28.44 --> 03:06:30.44
Oh, that's what I'm thinking.

3788
03:06:30.44 --> 03:06:31.44
Now I'm that bastard.

3789
03:06:31.44 --> 03:06:32.44
Bastard.

3790
03:06:32.44 --> 03:06:33.44
Bastard.

3791
03:06:33.44 --> 03:06:37.44
Yeah, but I'm literally not to be trusted.

3792
03:06:37.44 --> 03:06:38.44
Fuck.

3793
03:06:38.44 --> 03:06:39.44
No.

3794
03:06:39.44 --> 03:06:40.44
Okay.

3795
03:06:40.44 --> 03:06:42.44
Also, hey, Jack was a story.

3796
03:06:42.44 --> 03:06:43.44
It's called Jackal Store.

3797
03:06:43.44 --> 03:06:44.44
He's shirt, Jackal and weird.

3798
03:06:44.44 --> 03:06:45.44
Yeah, man.

3799
03:06:45.44 --> 03:06:46.44
I think I need to get one of these.

3800
03:06:46.44 --> 03:06:47.44
This clinic was freedom.

3801
03:06:47.44 --> 03:06:48.44
My fucking shirt.

3802
03:06:48.44 --> 03:06:52.44
You know, I wrote a song recently that I named discipline equals freedom.

3803
03:06:52.44 --> 03:06:53.44
Oh, okay.

3804
03:06:53.44 --> 03:06:54.44
Yeah.

3805
03:06:54.44 --> 03:06:55.44
Yeah.

3806
03:06:55.44 --> 03:06:58.44
And just I got a fucking say because, you know, I don't give a fuck.

3807
03:06:58.44 --> 03:07:00.44
I'm going to say it.

3808
03:07:00.44 --> 03:07:05.44
And that's that, you know, when I found out that Jackal was in the hardcore.

3809
03:07:05.44 --> 03:07:12.44
And when I found out that he was into my band, the chrome axe, I was very proud

3810
03:07:12.44 --> 03:07:15.44
and all.

3811
03:07:15.44 --> 03:07:19.44
And I asked this mother, fuck, you have thought about singing in the hardcore.

3812
03:07:19.44 --> 03:07:23.44
And the fucking reaction I got out of this mother fucker.

3813
03:07:23.44 --> 03:07:29.18
If my computer screen could just turn into like a fucking screaming like, ah, the mother

3814
03:07:29.18 --> 03:07:32.44
fucking, the response.

3815
03:07:32.44 --> 03:07:38.44
Anyway, I'm very proud to say that what we're going to be playing besides doing this

3816
03:07:38.44 --> 03:07:43.44
European tour, I'm going away in week playing all with place.

3817
03:07:43.44 --> 03:07:46.44
And we're coming back and in June, I'm going to be playing in LA.

3818
03:07:46.44 --> 03:07:52.44
And we have invited Jacko to come and make a special guest appearance when we play at the

3819
03:07:52.44 --> 03:07:54.44
Fury Fest in LA.

3820
03:07:54.44 --> 03:08:00.72
So for all you mother fuckers out there who want to see me playing with one of the baddest

3821
03:08:00.72 --> 03:08:06.44
mother fuckers walking this fucking earth certified by the US fucking government.

3822
03:08:06.44 --> 03:08:11.44
Then you, you, you, you were going to see some fucking badass shit because I'll tell you,

3823
03:08:11.44 --> 03:08:17.44
I have not gotten, I haven't been able to just play the bass and not be like chained to the microphone

3824
03:08:17.44 --> 03:08:18.44
in a really long time.

3825
03:08:18.44 --> 03:08:23.44
And that was one of the things that was intense about the chromaics back in the old days was that me and the singer both used to go

3826
03:08:23.44 --> 03:08:26.44
fucking, ape shit when we played.

3827
03:08:26.44 --> 03:08:29.44
And it's funny because you know, I was, I've been thinking for the longest time.

3828
03:08:29.44 --> 03:08:33.44
And if I could get a singer, what I get, and I'm like, you know, shit.

3829
03:08:33.44 --> 03:08:37.44
I'm like, you know, Henry Rons and his prime was fucking badass, you know,

3830
03:08:37.44 --> 03:08:41.44
Philon Selma when his prime was a fucking badass.

3831
03:08:41.44 --> 03:08:44.44
I wanted to have a joke with you.

3832
03:08:44.44 --> 03:08:47.44
So, what's he, what happens if my kids up in my hands?

3833
03:08:47.44 --> 03:08:51.44
You would have to watch all you motherfuckers and what is he some shit?

3834
03:08:51.44 --> 03:08:54.44
You know, I used to have a fake seals singing in my band.

3835
03:08:54.44 --> 03:08:56.44
I didn't get a real one.

3836
03:08:56.44 --> 03:08:59.44
What's he, what happens if my, if a mic ends up in my hands?

3837
03:08:59.44 --> 03:09:01.44
Well, I may have to slap with him.

3838
03:09:01.44 --> 03:09:03.44
I can see what happens.

3839
03:09:03.44 --> 03:09:07.44
Oh, boom. Yeah, you can sing the, or with those shirts on.

3840
03:09:07.44 --> 03:09:08.44
Yeah, that's a little bit.

3841
03:09:08.44 --> 03:09:09.44
That's fucking right.

3842
03:09:09.44 --> 03:09:12.44
Well, yeah, man, jockel story, that's where you get him.

3843
03:09:12.44 --> 03:09:14.44
I got you. Whatever shirt you need.

3844
03:09:14.44 --> 03:09:15.44
Oh yeah, for sure.

3845
03:09:15.44 --> 03:09:19.44
But if you're in the mood to support the podcast purchase a shirt or whatever,

3846
03:09:19.44 --> 03:09:21.44
we have other stuff on there.

3847
03:09:21.44 --> 03:09:22.44
Jockel story, calm.

3848
03:09:22.44 --> 03:09:24.44
What about those mugs you made?

3849
03:09:24.44 --> 03:09:25.44
Yeah, those are some good mugs.

3850
03:09:25.44 --> 03:09:27.44
So I shouldn't have even said this.

3851
03:09:27.44 --> 03:09:30.44
He's been amped about these brawffy mugs we got.

3852
03:09:30.44 --> 03:09:33.44
Or what do you call travel mugs? Travel mugs, tumblers.

3853
03:09:33.44 --> 03:09:34.44
I've heard, yeah, I've heard.

3854
03:09:34.44 --> 03:09:35.44
Here we go.

3855
03:09:35.44 --> 03:09:37.44
All right, look, I won't go that deep into it this time.

3856
03:09:37.44 --> 03:09:39.44
Next time I'm going deep.

3857
03:09:39.44 --> 03:09:41.44
Extra deep. This time I'll go just kind of deep.

3858
03:09:41.44 --> 03:09:44.44
This is straight up the best cup of everything.

3859
03:09:44.44 --> 03:09:45.44
It's a look and look like his head.

3860
03:09:45.44 --> 03:09:46.44
It's like a hands-line.

3861
03:09:46.44 --> 03:09:47.44
Yeah, look, look, look, look.

3862
03:09:47.44 --> 03:09:48.44
Drop better.

3863
03:09:48.44 --> 03:09:48.44
Drop better.

3864
03:09:48.44 --> 03:09:51.44
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3865
03:09:51.44 --> 03:09:53.44
Actually, we kept it a little bit.

3866
03:09:53.44 --> 03:09:55.44
You know, it's just black on black.

3867
03:09:55.44 --> 03:09:57.44
It's like black matte and then the design.

3868
03:09:57.44 --> 03:09:59.44
You know, it looks like this on one side.

3869
03:09:59.44 --> 03:10:01.44
And then it's shiny black.

3870
03:10:01.44 --> 03:10:03.44
Anyway, it looks super dope.

3871
03:10:03.44 --> 03:10:04.44
But 30 ounces.

3872
03:10:04.44 --> 03:10:05.44
So big enough.

3873
03:10:05.44 --> 03:10:08.44
But small enough, just fitting your cup holder.

3874
03:10:08.44 --> 03:10:09.44
Boom.

3875
03:10:09.44 --> 03:10:11.44
I'd be drinking some motherfuck coffee.

3876
03:10:11.44 --> 03:10:13.44
So, so here's the thing.

3877
03:10:13.44 --> 03:10:14.44
But the coffee.

3878
03:10:14.44 --> 03:10:17.44
It's those ones that are like,

3879
03:10:17.44 --> 03:10:20.44
I don't know how they make them, you know, the inside and the, I don't know.

3880
03:10:20.44 --> 03:10:24.44
They're stainless steel, BPA-free, all this, you know, good stuff.

3881
03:10:24.44 --> 03:10:27.44
I don't know what all of that means, but it's, I know it's dope.

3882
03:10:27.44 --> 03:10:28.44
It's krill involved.

3883
03:10:28.44 --> 03:10:30.44
Yeah, it's somewhere, you know, down the line.

3884
03:10:30.44 --> 03:10:32.44
It's, uh, krill is involved.

3885
03:10:32.44 --> 03:10:36.44
But it keeps it like your, if you like your coffee hot,

3886
03:10:36.44 --> 03:10:39.44
it'll keep it hot for like eight hours or something like that.

3887
03:10:39.44 --> 03:10:42.44
I don't know if it keeps it the same temperature for eight hours.

3888
03:10:42.44 --> 03:10:43.44
It might, I don't know.

3889
03:10:43.44 --> 03:10:44.44
I've never had hot summer.

3890
03:10:44.44 --> 03:10:46.44
I'm a cold coffee guy.

3891
03:10:46.44 --> 03:10:48.44
All right. Well, here's a good news about that, bro.

3892
03:10:48.44 --> 03:10:49.44
I'm sure.

3893
03:10:49.44 --> 03:10:50.44
But you put, put, put, how's this?

3894
03:10:50.44 --> 03:10:53.44
I put ice water in it and I was drinking it.

3895
03:10:53.44 --> 03:10:56.44
I drank, like almost all of it.

3896
03:10:56.44 --> 03:10:59.44
There was still a little bit in the bottom and I forgot about it.

3897
03:10:59.44 --> 03:11:00.44
Went to sleep.

3898
03:11:00.44 --> 03:11:01.44
The next day I was cleaning up.

3899
03:11:01.44 --> 03:11:03.44
I was like, oh, my cup from last night.

3900
03:11:03.44 --> 03:11:05.44
Boom, ice, still in there.

3901
03:11:05.44 --> 03:11:07.44
You know how usually in a regular cup, it's like water.

3902
03:11:07.44 --> 03:11:09.44
It'll keep it cold for 24 hours.

3903
03:11:09.44 --> 03:11:12.44
Boom, not losing any coldness.

3904
03:11:12.44 --> 03:11:15.44
Anyway, I want to go way deeper next time.

3905
03:11:15.44 --> 03:11:16.44
But this is straight.

3906
03:11:16.44 --> 03:11:19.44
You have a special podcast for you to talk about that, that cup.

3907
03:11:19.44 --> 03:11:20.44
A very good cup.

3908
03:11:20.44 --> 03:11:22.44
Yeah, one episode will be the cup.

3909
03:11:22.44 --> 03:11:24.44
The other episode will be the oil.

3910
03:11:24.44 --> 03:11:25.44
Yeah. Oh, no, oil.

3911
03:11:25.44 --> 03:11:26.44
That's it.

3912
03:11:26.44 --> 03:11:27.44
That's everything.

3913
03:11:27.44 --> 03:11:28.44
I'll go deep.

3914
03:11:28.44 --> 03:11:29.44
I'll go deep with the oil.

3915
03:11:29.44 --> 03:11:32.44
Bro, I'll go deep with the grill oil right now if we have to.

3916
03:11:32.44 --> 03:11:33.44
I know what.

3917
03:11:33.44 --> 03:11:34.44
Anyway, I'll go to the oil.

3918
03:11:34.44 --> 03:11:35.44
Jockelster.

3919
03:11:35.44 --> 03:11:36.44
Yeah.

3920
03:11:36.44 --> 03:11:38.44
It's essentially what it is anyway.

3921
03:11:38.44 --> 03:11:39.44
But yeah.

3922
03:11:39.44 --> 03:11:41.44
But yeah, Jockelster, this is some cool stuff on there.

3923
03:11:41.44 --> 03:11:42.44
Travel mugs are out.

3924
03:11:42.44 --> 03:11:43.44
Those are good.

3925
03:11:43.44 --> 03:11:46.44
There's some bumper stickers, some women stuff on there.

3926
03:11:46.44 --> 03:11:49.44
Some patches, some rash guards, one new rash guard.

3927
03:11:49.44 --> 03:11:51.44
And it's not, it'll be out.

3928
03:11:51.44 --> 03:11:53.44
But nonetheless, I'm not going to promise anything quite yet.

3929
03:11:53.44 --> 03:11:55.44
But new rash guards can be out.

3930
03:11:55.44 --> 03:11:56.44
Hoodies are out there.

3931
03:11:56.44 --> 03:11:57.44
There's some good stuff.

3932
03:11:57.44 --> 03:11:58.44
Hey, just take a look.

3933
03:11:58.44 --> 03:12:01.44
If you like what's on there, you want to support it in that way.

3934
03:12:01.44 --> 03:12:02.44
Get something.

3935
03:12:02.44 --> 03:12:04.44
Also psychological warfare.

3936
03:12:04.44 --> 03:12:05.44
Okay.

3937
03:12:05.44 --> 03:12:08.44
All right, Harley might not know about psychological warfare.

3938
03:12:08.44 --> 03:12:09.44
So I'm going to explain it.

3939
03:12:09.44 --> 03:12:10.44
Good deed.

3940
03:12:10.44 --> 03:12:11.44
Not that deed.

3941
03:12:11.44 --> 03:12:13.44
So basically, it's an album.

3942
03:12:13.44 --> 03:12:15.44
We're three hours and 18 minutes into this.

3943
03:12:15.44 --> 03:12:16.44
We're gonna stop.

3944
03:12:16.44 --> 03:12:17.44
All right.

3945
03:12:17.44 --> 03:12:18.44
It's an album.

3946
03:12:18.44 --> 03:12:19.44
There he does the care.

3947
03:12:19.44 --> 03:12:20.44
Echo don't care.

3948
03:12:20.44 --> 03:12:21.44
Echo don't care.

3949
03:12:21.44 --> 03:12:22.44
He doesn't care.

3950
03:12:22.44 --> 03:12:24.44
No, I'm just saying this part is kind of important too.

3951
03:12:24.44 --> 03:12:25.44
Okay.

3952
03:12:25.44 --> 03:12:28.44
I mean, people are out there getting after it.

3953
03:12:28.44 --> 03:12:28.44
Yeah.

3954
03:12:28.44 --> 03:12:29.44
Waking up early.

3955
03:12:29.44 --> 03:12:31.44
Some people, some of us.

3956
03:12:31.44 --> 03:12:33.44
Sticking to the programs,

3957
03:12:33.44 --> 03:12:35.44
sticking to the diet, sticking to the workouts.

3958
03:12:35.44 --> 03:12:36.44
Right?

3959
03:12:36.44 --> 03:12:39.44
Everyone's on all you wake up or you don't feel like waking up early that day.

3960
03:12:39.44 --> 03:12:41.44
Or you don't feel like working out that day.

3961
03:12:41.44 --> 03:12:42.44
You're kind of tired.

3962
03:12:42.44 --> 03:12:44.44
You at a hard day, whatever.

3963
03:12:44.44 --> 03:12:47.44
So when it's time to, when it's go time, you're like,

3964
03:12:47.44 --> 03:12:49.44
hey, maybe I'll skip today.

3965
03:12:49.44 --> 03:12:50.44
You know, when you're sleeping on the program.

3966
03:12:50.44 --> 03:12:51.44
You know what I'm feeling?

3967
03:12:51.44 --> 03:12:52.44
Yeah.

3968
03:12:52.44 --> 03:12:54.44
Just a boy and we all did.

3969
03:12:54.44 --> 03:12:55.44
When you skip your week grass.

3970
03:12:55.44 --> 03:12:59.44
Exactly right.

3971
03:12:59.44 --> 03:13:00.44
So bam, you get this.

3972
03:13:00.44 --> 03:13:01.44
It's okay.

3973
03:13:01.44 --> 03:13:03.44
It's an album called Psychological References.

3974
03:13:03.44 --> 03:13:04.44
It's not music.

3975
03:13:04.44 --> 03:13:10.44
It's just tracks with Jocco telling you how to overcome those week moments in your program.

3976
03:13:10.44 --> 03:13:11.44
Oh boy.

3977
03:13:11.44 --> 03:13:14.44
But it's him telling when I, when I, when I, I'm having a week moment,

3978
03:13:14.44 --> 03:13:16.44
the last thing I want to fucking hear is,

3979
03:13:16.44 --> 03:13:21.44
Choco fucking telling me to get after it.

3980
03:13:21.44 --> 03:13:23.44
Oh fuck, really, right now.

3981
03:13:23.44 --> 03:13:24.44
I gotta do that.

3982
03:13:24.44 --> 03:13:25.44
Really, fuck.

3983
03:13:25.44 --> 03:13:26.44
It's 4 o'clock.

3984
03:13:26.44 --> 03:13:27.44
I don't really have it.

3985
03:13:27.44 --> 03:13:30.44
Give me a fucking other four hours.

3986
03:13:30.44 --> 03:13:32.44
Fuck me.

3987
03:13:32.44 --> 03:13:33.44
You know, I like sleep.

3988
03:13:33.44 --> 03:13:35.44
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you guys, but whatever.

3989
03:13:35.44 --> 03:13:36.44
That's all good.

3990
03:13:36.44 --> 03:13:37.44
Yeah, heck.

3991
03:13:37.44 --> 03:13:38.44
You know, echo like sleep too.

3992
03:13:38.44 --> 03:13:39.44
I like sleep a lot.

3993
03:13:39.44 --> 03:13:40.44
I'm having a lot of sleep.

3994
03:13:40.44 --> 03:13:41.44
I like dreams.

3995
03:13:41.44 --> 03:13:42.44
No, I like sleep too.

3996
03:13:42.44 --> 03:13:44.44
No, actually I don't sleep as the enemy.

3997
03:13:44.44 --> 03:13:49.44
I mean, I like the way it's like it's like the last hallucinogenic I can take.

3998
03:13:49.44 --> 03:13:50.44
Yeah.

3999
03:13:50.44 --> 03:13:51.44
Yeah.

4000
03:13:51.44 --> 03:13:53.44
It's about sleep.

4001
03:13:53.44 --> 03:13:54.44
It's just a sleep.

4002
03:13:54.44 --> 03:13:55.44
I dream.

4003
03:13:55.44 --> 03:13:56.44
My brain goes bananas.

4004
03:13:56.44 --> 03:13:57.44
Love it.

4005
03:13:57.44 --> 03:13:58.44
Yeah.

4006
03:13:58.44 --> 03:14:00.44
If you have my dreams, you don't want to sleep.

4007
03:14:00.44 --> 03:14:02.44
I love prefer to be awake.

4008
03:14:02.44 --> 03:14:02.44
Yeah.

4009
03:14:02.44 --> 03:14:03.44
I hear your sense.

4010
03:14:03.44 --> 03:14:04.44
Yeah.

4011
03:14:04.44 --> 03:14:04.44
Yeah.

4012
03:14:04.44 --> 03:14:05.44
Okay.

4013
03:14:05.44 --> 03:14:06.44
I get it.

4014
03:14:06.44 --> 03:14:09.44
But it goes for the workout from 2 to not just a sleep.

4015
03:14:09.44 --> 03:14:11.44
So you can skip the sleep ones.

4016
03:14:11.44 --> 03:14:13.44
So you go, like, they, they work out when it's heavy.

4017
03:14:13.44 --> 03:14:14.44
You don't skip the workout.

4018
03:14:14.44 --> 03:14:15.44
Anyway, it's good.

4019
03:14:15.44 --> 03:14:16.44
Very helpful.

4020
03:14:16.44 --> 03:14:19.44
100% chance of success with talent.

4021
03:14:19.44 --> 03:14:20.44
That's a good one.

4022
03:14:20.44 --> 03:14:22.44
Psychological warfare.

4023
03:14:22.44 --> 03:14:29.44
And also, by the way, when you click through Amazon, you can click through and you can buy this book right here.

4024
03:14:29.44 --> 03:14:32.44
The book is called Hardcore Life of My Own.

4025
03:14:32.44 --> 03:14:35.44
It is written by Harley Flanagan.

4026
03:14:35.44 --> 03:14:37.44
And we'll have it up on the website.

4027
03:14:37.44 --> 03:14:39.44
But let me refer to that.

4028
03:14:39.44 --> 03:14:40.44
It's on the website.

4029
03:14:40.44 --> 03:14:43.44
So we're waiting to be purchased.

4030
03:14:43.44 --> 03:14:45.44
And there you go.

4031
03:14:45.44 --> 03:14:46.44
Pick it up.

4032
03:14:46.44 --> 03:14:50.44
On Amazon, you can also get some jok a white tea.

4033
03:14:50.44 --> 03:14:56.44
I hear now there's some things in the book that Harley does not recommend.

4034
03:14:56.44 --> 03:14:59.44
He, he's tried them, but he does not recommend.

4035
03:14:59.44 --> 03:15:01.44
Some of those things that he clearly states in the book.

4036
03:15:01.44 --> 03:15:03.44
He literally says, I do not recommend.

4037
03:15:03.44 --> 03:15:07.44
For instance, I do not recommend angel bust.

4038
03:15:07.44 --> 03:15:09.44
I do not recommend heroin.

4039
03:15:09.44 --> 03:15:10.44
I do not.

4040
03:15:10.44 --> 03:15:11.44
So there's a lot of things he doesn't recommend.

4041
03:15:11.44 --> 03:15:14.44
Now, here's something that I will strongly recommend.

4042
03:15:14.44 --> 03:15:16.44
And that's Jokal White Tea.

4043
03:15:16.44 --> 03:15:21.44
It's going to get you a lot better results than anything.

4044
03:15:21.44 --> 03:15:25.44
Any of the supplements that Harley's taking in this book.

4045
03:15:25.44 --> 03:15:27.44
You go with Jokal White Tea instead.

4046
03:15:27.44 --> 03:15:29.44
You're going to have a much better trip.

4047
03:15:29.44 --> 03:15:32.44
I'm going to tell you that right now.

4048
03:15:32.44 --> 03:15:35.44
Also, we talked a lot about jjitsu today.

4049
03:15:35.44 --> 03:15:37.44
And we talked about jjitsu a lot.

4050
03:15:37.44 --> 03:15:41.44
You know, jjitsu is a powerful thing.

4051
03:15:41.44 --> 03:15:44.44
And there's a book that's out right now.

4052
03:15:44.44 --> 03:15:45.44
And it's geared.

4053
03:15:45.44 --> 03:15:47.44
It's written kind of written for kids.

4054
03:15:47.44 --> 03:15:49.44
It's called Way of the War Your Kid.

4055
03:15:49.44 --> 03:15:50.44
It's available.

4056
03:15:50.44 --> 03:15:51.44
Everyone that's bought it already.

4057
03:15:51.44 --> 03:15:52.44
Thank you.

4058
03:15:52.44 --> 03:15:54.44
I appreciate the support.

4059
03:15:54.44 --> 03:15:56.44
Thanks for spreading the word.

4060
03:15:56.44 --> 03:15:59.44
Thanks for letting kids get a little insight into life.

4061
03:15:59.44 --> 03:16:05.44
And I'll tell you there's something about this book that is,

4062
03:16:05.44 --> 03:16:09.44
that I wrote it.

4063
03:16:09.44 --> 03:16:11.44
The, the, the father.

4064
03:16:11.44 --> 03:16:13.44
The book is about a kid who's, you know,

4065
03:16:13.44 --> 03:16:15.44
fifth grade going through life.

4066
03:16:15.44 --> 03:16:20.44
The father in the book doesn't have a role.

4067
03:16:20.44 --> 03:16:24.44
Now, you might think I'm a, you know, bad person for not giving the father the role.

4068
03:16:24.44 --> 03:16:28.44
But, you know, the jjitsu, all he says, there's one line about the father in the book.

4069
03:16:28.44 --> 03:16:33.44
He says, my dad's gone a lot with work and stuff.

4070
03:16:33.44 --> 03:16:36.44
It's that ambiguous.

4071
03:16:36.44 --> 03:16:39.44
And there's a couple reasons why I did that.

4072
03:16:39.44 --> 03:16:43.44
And the number one reason is because not everyone, not every kid has got a dad.

4073
03:16:43.44 --> 03:16:45.44
I mean, what you're saying is actually very real.

4074
03:16:45.44 --> 03:16:46.44
Yeah.

4075
03:16:46.44 --> 03:16:49.44
You know, and a lot of kids have to just deal with,

4076
03:16:49.44 --> 03:16:52.44
oh, yeah, my father's not around much.

4077
03:16:52.44 --> 03:16:53.44
Yeah, you know.

4078
03:16:53.44 --> 03:16:55.44
And that's why I did it.

4079
03:16:55.44 --> 03:16:57.44
And there's another subtle reason.

4080
03:16:57.44 --> 03:17:01.44
And, you know, without going into too much crazy detail,

4081
03:17:01.44 --> 03:17:04.44
the lead character in the book is named as Mark.

4082
03:17:04.44 --> 03:17:09.44
And he's actually named after Mark Lee who was one of my guys,

4083
03:17:09.44 --> 03:17:14.44
just incredible, incredible person, incredible warrior,

4084
03:17:14.44 --> 03:17:16.44
and he was killed in Iraq.

4085
03:17:16.44 --> 03:17:20.44
And, you know, he was, he never did.

4086
03:17:20.44 --> 03:17:22.44
His mom raised him.

4087
03:17:22.44 --> 03:17:26.44
And, you know, so it was my way of saying, look,

4088
03:17:26.44 --> 03:17:28.44
you know, not everyone has a dad.

4089
03:17:28.44 --> 03:17:32.44
And in the book, he's got a strong uncle that comes in and helps him.

4090
03:17:32.44 --> 03:17:34.44
But at the end of the book, his uncle points out to them.

4091
03:17:34.44 --> 03:17:36.44
He says, who's going to help me now?

4092
03:17:36.44 --> 03:17:40.44
And his uncle says to him, look, you don't need to,

4093
03:17:40.44 --> 03:17:42.44
you know what the right things to do are.

4094
03:17:42.44 --> 03:17:44.44
You know how to stay on the right path.

4095
03:17:44.44 --> 03:17:46.44
You don't need someone to hold your hand all the time.

4096
03:17:46.44 --> 03:17:48.44
You can make this happen for yourself.

4097
03:17:48.44 --> 03:17:50.44
And that's my, the message, you know,

4098
03:17:50.44 --> 03:17:52.44
that I'm trying to get across to kids that might not have a dad.

4099
03:17:52.44 --> 03:17:54.44
They might not have an uncle.

4100
03:17:54.44 --> 03:17:55.44
They might not have a mom.

4101
03:17:55.44 --> 03:17:58.44
But you can find out what the right path is.

4102
03:17:58.44 --> 03:17:59.44
You can get on it.

4103
03:17:59.44 --> 03:18:00.44
You can stay on it.

4104
03:18:00.44 --> 03:18:02.44
And that's, that's why I wrote the book that way.

4105
03:18:02.44 --> 03:18:04.44
And, and you know, it's, it's interesting because I've got

4106
03:18:04.44 --> 03:18:08.44
asked many times over the years, you know, about what do you think about

4107
03:18:08.44 --> 03:18:11.44
fatherhood and, and the important roles that father's play.

4108
03:18:11.44 --> 03:18:13.44
And again, you know, I go back to, for instance,

4109
03:18:13.44 --> 03:18:15.44
Mark Lees, a great example of a kid that was raised.

4110
03:18:15.44 --> 03:18:16.44
And have a dad.

4111
03:18:16.44 --> 03:18:20.44
And his mom's a strong woman and a, and a incredible person.

4112
03:18:20.44 --> 03:18:21.44
And she raised a warrior.

4113
03:18:21.44 --> 03:18:24.44
So that's why I did that in that book.

4114
03:18:24.44 --> 03:18:26.44
And you know, another thing I did in that book is, you know,

4115
03:18:26.44 --> 03:18:29.44
Gigietsu plays a prominent role, but you could replace that with wrestling,

4116
03:18:29.44 --> 03:18:34.44
with boxing, with, with Moitai, but Gigietsu is really a big part of it.

4117
03:18:34.44 --> 03:18:39.44
But so is studying, you know, learning, learning how to learn.

4118
03:18:39.44 --> 03:18:44.44
And, and, and as a kid seeing what the opportunity is in being educated,

4119
03:18:44.44 --> 03:18:46.44
because a lot of kids, myself included when you're going to school,

4120
03:18:46.44 --> 03:18:49.44
when you're 10 years old or 15 years old, you don't care.

4121
03:18:49.44 --> 03:18:51.44
You just don't care.

4122
03:18:51.44 --> 03:18:56.44
And it's, I want, I want kids to realize that it's beneficial to get

4123
03:18:56.44 --> 03:18:59.44
stronger, faster, smarter, and better.

4124
03:18:59.44 --> 03:19:04.44
So that's it way of the warrior kid, get it, and get it for your local library,

4125
03:19:04.44 --> 03:19:09.44
too, because they need it, because there's some kid that will grab that book

4126
03:19:09.44 --> 03:19:12.44
in the library and you'll get him on the right path.

4127
03:19:12.44 --> 03:19:15.44
Also, discipline equals freedom, field manual.

4128
03:19:15.44 --> 03:19:20.44
You can find it by itself in the get after it's section.

4129
03:19:20.44 --> 03:19:24.44
Of any bookstore or online book retailer.

4130
03:19:24.44 --> 03:19:26.44
If you look in the get after it's section, this is a big empty shelf.

4131
03:19:26.44 --> 03:19:28.44
There's a one book that's called this,

4132
03:19:28.44 --> 03:19:30.44
Plunicos Freedom Field Manual.

4133
03:19:30.44 --> 03:19:33.44
We have to start petitioning now to make that happen at Amazon.

4134
03:19:33.44 --> 03:19:37.44
They just need like, when you drop down business, lifestyle, health and fitness,

4135
03:19:37.44 --> 03:19:38.44
get it after it's a boom.

4136
03:19:38.44 --> 03:19:39.44
There's that one book.

4137
03:19:39.44 --> 03:19:42.44
They better get in the game.

4138
03:19:42.44 --> 03:19:44.44
And,

4139
03:19:44.44 --> 03:19:47.44
also there's extreme ownership.

4140
03:19:47.44 --> 03:19:50.44
They're a book that kind of started all of this stuff, by the way.

4141
03:19:50.44 --> 03:19:51.44
Thanks, appreciate it.

4142
03:19:51.44 --> 03:19:55.44
It's about leadership, and it's about combat,

4143
03:19:55.44 --> 03:19:59.44
and it's about taking fucking responsibility, and it's about taking responsibility.

4144
03:19:59.44 --> 03:20:01.44
And that's fucking huge.

4145
03:20:01.44 --> 03:20:02.44
That's huge.

4146
03:20:02.44 --> 03:20:08.44
That's something that I think is one of the hardest things for most people to do.

4147
03:20:08.44 --> 03:20:12.44
And you know, I actually highlighted that a bunch of times in your book,

4148
03:20:12.44 --> 03:20:16.44
where you're kind of explaining things that

4149
03:20:16.44 --> 03:20:17.44
you're talking about,

4150
03:20:17.44 --> 03:20:20.44
I guess you would say maybe resulted in something happening in bad in your life,

4151
03:20:20.44 --> 03:20:22.44
and you'd say, hey, this happened, and this happened, and this happened,

4152
03:20:22.44 --> 03:20:24.44
and every time you went, laid that out,

4153
03:20:24.44 --> 03:20:25.44
at the end of it, you'd say,

4154
03:20:25.44 --> 03:20:27.44
but it's my fault.

4155
03:20:27.44 --> 03:20:30.44
And I should have done, I made this happen to myself.

4156
03:20:30.44 --> 03:20:33.44
So it's pretty, and you wrote this book before,

4157
03:20:33.44 --> 03:20:34.44
you probably write this to me,

4158
03:20:34.44 --> 03:20:36.44
and I know you were writing this book the same to our,

4159
03:20:36.44 --> 03:20:39.44
I was writing that book when I was basically fucking trying to kill myself,

4160
03:20:39.44 --> 03:20:42.44
drugs and everything else is when I started it.

4161
03:20:42.44 --> 03:20:47.44
And even in that state, you always say, you know, it's my fault.

4162
03:20:47.44 --> 03:20:50.44
I should have, you know, hey, my dad always make a habit

4163
03:20:50.44 --> 03:20:52.44
out of looking for other people to blame.

4164
03:20:52.44 --> 03:20:59.44
I mean, it's important to identify the roots of the problem

4165
03:20:59.44 --> 03:21:02.44
and so on, and what made you the way you are,

4166
03:21:02.44 --> 03:21:05.44
so you can fix them exactly.

4167
03:21:05.44 --> 03:21:07.44
So now, exactly.

4168
03:21:07.44 --> 03:21:11.44
And a big part of being a man is accepting responsibility

4169
03:21:11.44 --> 03:21:13.44
for your fuck-ups.

4170
03:21:13.44 --> 03:21:15.44
Yeah, and I thought that was awesome.

4171
03:21:15.44 --> 03:21:17.44
You know, and again, you know,

4172
03:21:17.44 --> 03:21:21.44
when you were talking about what you learned from your dad

4173
03:21:21.44 --> 03:21:24.44
not being around, and then how you apply that to help other kids

4174
03:21:24.44 --> 03:21:26.44
that are in that situation, teaching them to jitsu

4175
03:21:26.44 --> 03:21:28.44
and take care of them and build relationships

4176
03:21:28.44 --> 03:21:30.44
the best you can with your kids and with other kids

4177
03:21:30.44 --> 03:21:34.44
that around man, that's exactly what you're talking about.

4178
03:21:34.44 --> 03:21:37.44
So that's extreme ownership,

4179
03:21:37.44 --> 03:21:40.44
and also don't hoard the knowledge.

4180
03:21:40.44 --> 03:21:43.44
You might think, hey, I'm going to get extreme ownership

4181
03:21:43.44 --> 03:21:44.44
for myself.

4182
03:21:44.44 --> 03:21:45.44
I'm going to read it at night,

4183
03:21:45.44 --> 03:21:46.44
and then I'm going to become a good leader,

4184
03:21:46.44 --> 03:21:47.44
and I'm going to do better at work.

4185
03:21:47.44 --> 03:21:48.44
Don't do that.

4186
03:21:48.44 --> 03:21:49.44
That's the wrong move.

4187
03:21:49.44 --> 03:21:51.44
What you want to do is you want to actually distribute it

4188
03:21:51.44 --> 03:21:52.44
to your team.

4189
03:21:52.44 --> 03:21:53.44
Yeah.

4190
03:21:53.44 --> 03:21:54.44
And that way they all get on board,

4191
03:21:54.44 --> 03:21:55.44
and now the whole team starts kicking ass.

4192
03:21:55.44 --> 03:21:57.44
That's what you want to do.

4193
03:21:57.44 --> 03:21:59.44
Up and down the chain of command.

4194
03:21:59.44 --> 03:22:01.44
Then if you need more than that,

4195
03:22:01.44 --> 03:22:03.44
you can hire our leadership and management consulting company

4196
03:22:03.44 --> 03:22:04.44
echelon fund.

4197
03:22:04.44 --> 03:22:09.44
We are the premier leadership consulting company.

4198
03:22:09.44 --> 03:22:12.44

So where are the ones that teach the methods and the techniques

4200
03:22:18.44 --> 03:22:22.44

4201

proven and combat?

4202
03:22:24.44 --> 03:22:29.44
So you can email contact us info at echelonfront.com.

4203
03:22:29.44 --> 03:22:34.44
We just had the master number two in New York City.

4204
03:22:34.44 --> 03:22:37.44
Awesome event.

4205
03:22:37.44 --> 03:22:40.44
If you missed it, come to Texas.

4206
03:22:40.44 --> 03:22:42.44
July 13, 14.

4207
03:22:42.44 --> 03:22:45.44
Omni Barton Creek, resort and spa.

4208
03:22:45.44 --> 03:22:47.44
And again, forget about the spa.

4209
03:22:47.44 --> 03:22:48.44
You're not going to spa.

4210
03:22:48.44 --> 03:22:49.44
Don't come for the spa.

4211
03:22:49.44 --> 03:22:50.44
Not happening.

4212
03:22:50.44 --> 03:22:52.44
But what we'll be happening is leadership.

4213
03:22:52.44 --> 03:22:55.44
We'll talk about combat leadership and how to apply that

4214
03:22:55.44 --> 03:22:57.44
to your business and to your life.

4215
03:22:57.44 --> 03:22:58.44
And if you can't make Texas,

4216
03:22:58.44 --> 03:23:00.44
okay, we got backup.

4217
03:23:00.44 --> 03:23:02.44
We got contingency operations.

4218
03:23:02.44 --> 03:23:03.44
If you can't come to Texas,

4219
03:23:03.44 --> 03:23:05.44
September 14th and 15th,

4220
03:23:05.44 --> 03:23:09.44
we will be back in San Diego on my home turf.

4221
03:23:09.44 --> 03:23:10.44
Where there is no winter.

4222
03:23:10.44 --> 03:23:13.44
We got big yards and barbecue spoiled mother.

4223
03:23:13.44 --> 03:23:14.44
First floor.

4224
03:23:14.44 --> 03:23:16.44
And that's a regular like it.

4225
03:23:16.44 --> 03:23:18.44
It's alright.

4226
03:23:18.44 --> 03:23:20.44
You're entitled to be spoiled at this point in your life.

4227
03:23:20.44 --> 03:23:21.44
It's, I'll take it.

4228
03:23:21.44 --> 03:23:23.44
I'll give you a pass on that.

4229
03:23:23.44 --> 03:23:25.44
Until the monsters,

4230
03:23:25.44 --> 03:23:28.44
we can be found actually on the interwebs.

4231
03:23:28.44 --> 03:23:31.44
On Twitter, on Instagram.

4232
03:23:31.44 --> 03:23:33.44
It in the Facebook.

4233
03:23:33.44 --> 03:23:35.44
Okay, I'm going to find it there.

4234
03:23:35.44 --> 03:23:39.44
Hardly is at Harley F.

4235
03:23:39.44 --> 03:23:41.44
Flanagan.

4236
03:23:41.44 --> 03:23:45.44
In Flanagan to spelled F.L.A.N.A.

4237
03:23:45.44 --> 03:23:47.44
G.A.N.

4238
03:23:47.44 --> 03:23:49.44
Harley F. Flanagan.

4239
03:23:49.44 --> 03:23:52.44
Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at

4240
03:23:52.44 --> 03:23:54.44
Jocca Willink.

4241
03:23:54.44 --> 03:23:57.44
Echo, you got anything else?

4242
03:23:57.44 --> 03:23:58.44
Nope, that's it.

4243
03:23:58.44 --> 03:24:00.44
Man, my pleasure.

4244
03:24:00.44 --> 03:24:03.44
Gentlemen, it was real pleasure.

4245
03:24:03.44 --> 03:24:05.44
Absolutely.

4246
03:24:05.44 --> 03:24:07.44
Any other closing comments you want to make?

4247
03:24:07.44 --> 03:24:12.44
I definitely wouldn't advise smoking, PCP.

4248
03:24:12.44 --> 03:24:15.44
Taking a list, not seriously.

4249
03:24:15.44 --> 03:24:18.44
No, thanks for having me on, man.

4250
03:24:18.44 --> 03:24:20.44
It's real pleasure.

4251
03:24:20.44 --> 03:24:25.44
You know, you become a big inspiration.

4252
03:24:25.44 --> 03:24:27.44
I love reading.

4253
03:24:27.44 --> 03:24:34.44
You're quotes in your books and listening in the podcast.

4254
03:24:34.44 --> 03:24:39.44
Sometimes it's exactly the kick in the ass that I need.

4255
03:24:39.44 --> 03:24:42.44
And I appreciate that.

4256
03:24:42.44 --> 03:24:49.44
And again, I'm very honored and proud to have been part of the soundtrack to your life.

4257
03:24:49.44 --> 03:24:50.44
Indeed.

4258
03:24:50.44 --> 03:24:51.44
Yes, indeed.

4259
03:24:51.44 --> 03:24:56.44
I'd also like to give a shout out to my better half who,

4260
03:24:56.44 --> 03:24:59.44
now her, I definitely wouldn't be doing so well.

4261
03:24:59.44 --> 03:25:01.44
My book would not be as good.

4262
03:25:01.44 --> 03:25:02.44
It would probably suck.

4263
03:25:02.44 --> 03:25:04.44
And my life would definitely suck.

4264
03:25:04.44 --> 03:25:07.44
So Laura Lee Flanagan, I love you.

4265
03:25:07.44 --> 03:25:11.44
And if my sons are listening to this podcast,

4266
03:25:11.44 --> 03:25:18.44
I love you boys and keep up all the good work and keep you training going.

4267
03:25:18.44 --> 03:25:21.44
And keep checking out Jocca Will's podcast.

4268
03:25:21.44 --> 03:25:24.44
You might learn a thing or two.

4269
03:25:24.44 --> 03:25:30.44
Awesome. Well, partly obviously, thanks for coming on the show and such a pleasure, man.

4270
03:25:30.44 --> 03:25:39.44
Thanks for the years of music that you gave to me and millions of other kids that

4271
03:25:39.44 --> 03:25:42.44
needed to hear it.

4272
03:25:42.44 --> 03:25:48.44
And thanks for making it through what you've made it through and coming out on the other side with a

4273
03:25:48.44 --> 03:26:01.44
positive outlook and a positive impact and a positive message that it's never too late

4274
03:26:01.44 --> 03:26:11.44
that it's never too dark and that we can always turn things around.

4275
03:26:11.44 --> 03:26:17.44
As long as you're alive, there is hope.

4276
03:26:17.44 --> 03:26:19.44
Yes, indeed.

4277
03:26:19.44 --> 03:26:21.44
Thanks to everyone else.

4278
03:26:21.44 --> 03:26:32.44
That's listening and supporting and spreading the word and as always to the folks in the military out there.

4279
03:26:32.44 --> 03:26:40.44
We salute you and thank you all for holding the demons at the gate.

4280
03:26:40.44 --> 03:26:47.44
And to the police and law enforcement and firefighters and EMTs and first responders.

4281
03:26:47.44 --> 03:26:52.44
Thanks for fighting the demons here at home.

4282
03:26:52.44 --> 03:26:59.44
And to anyone else that's out there that's listening.

4283
03:26:59.44 --> 03:27:05.44
That's started to go down.

4284
03:27:05.44 --> 03:27:23.44
And that hole down into that mall trapped in the chains of depression or addiction or rage.

4285
03:27:23.44 --> 03:27:34.44
When you're down in that hole, look up.

4286
03:27:34.44 --> 03:27:38.44
And recognize that there is a way out.

4287
03:27:38.44 --> 03:27:42.44
There is a path for you to take.

4288
03:27:42.44 --> 03:27:46.44
And it's not an easy path.

4289
03:27:46.44 --> 03:27:48.44
It'll be a fight.

4290
03:27:48.44 --> 03:27:56.44
It'll be a fight that demands focus and work and tenacity.

4291
03:27:56.44 --> 03:28:01.44
And of course discipline.

4292
03:28:01.44 --> 03:28:07.44
But it is that path.

4293
03:28:07.44 --> 03:28:19.44
That hard path, that hard path of discipline that will lead you to freedom.

4294
03:28:19.44 --> 03:28:24.44
So stay on that path.

4295
03:28:24.44 --> 03:28:33.44
And until next time, this is Harley Flanagan, Andeko, and Jocco.

4296
03:28:33.44 --> 03:28:55.44
Oh.
