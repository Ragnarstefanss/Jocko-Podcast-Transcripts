[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 221 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:09] June 15th, 2010. Members of the selection committee. It is with absolute conviction that I give my
[00:00:21] strongest possible personal recommendation to Jonathan Y Kim's selection for medical school.
[00:00:30] There is no one more qualified to make this recommendation than me. As Jonathan was under my
[00:00:36] direct supervision as a US Navy SEAL combat medic while I commanded SEAL Team 3 tasking
[00:00:43] abuser during the Battle of Ramadi Operation Iraqi Freedom from April until October 2006.
[00:00:52] During this time, the city of Ramadi was the epicenter of the insurgency and a place filled with
[00:00:58] fear, violence, casualties, and death. In that brutal and unforgiving environment,
[00:01:08] Jonathan's undontant courage, tenacious devotion to duty and superb skills as a combat
[00:01:16] medic were tested and proven over and over again. On one particular occasion, he and a small
[00:01:25] element of other SEAL combat advisors were leading a patrol of Iraqi soldiers through an enemy
[00:01:30] controlled sector of Ramadi. The patrol was ferociously ambushed, leaving an Iraqi soldier
[00:01:38] severely wounded and lying helpless in the street. Jonathan and another SEAL who had taken
[00:01:46] refuge from the enemy gunfire behind a concrete wall left their safe position and stormed
[00:01:53] forward into the hail of enemy bullets. They then dragged the wounded soldier under intense enemy
[00:02:00] fire back to a secure position where Jonathan immediately began performing combat trauma care
[00:02:06] on the Iraqi soldier. Another Iraqi soldier was then wounded by enemy fire. And Jonathan provided
[00:02:15] medical care to him as well, eventually organizing the casualty evacuation for the wounded men.
[00:02:24] Jonathan was awarded the Silver Star Medal in recognition of his bold courage under enemy fire.
[00:02:33] That level of heroism and bravery was not an isolated incident.
[00:02:37] On another occasion, Jonathan exposed himself to enemy sniper fire in order to attend
[00:02:44] to one of his SEAL-Potune mates who had been severely wounded by an enemy sniper round
[00:02:49] that had struck the SEAL in the face.
[00:02:53] Exposing himself to the enemy sniper fire that had just wounded his fellow SEAL
[00:02:58] and with blatant disregard for his own personal safety, Jonathan moved to the fallen SEAL
[00:03:03] stabilized the patient and organized the evacuation. For this action, he was awarded the
[00:03:10] Bronze Star Medal with combat distinguishing device. Jonathan's bold courage
[00:03:20] calm decisiveness and intrinsic desire to provide care to the wounded even under the most intense
[00:03:27] urban combat imaginable continued for our entire deployment. Even as combat fatigue said in
[00:03:35] on many of the men as they saw their teammates, friends and brothers and arms wounded or killed
[00:03:42] time and time again, Jonathan never faltered. I know that the horrors of combat have shown
[00:03:52] Jonathan more stress and chaos than most will ever see. I also know that he handled that stress
[00:04:00] and chaos with a calmness of heart and a steadiness of mind that any man would admire.
[00:04:10] As further evidence of this, after his deployment to Ramadi with task in a bruiser,
[00:04:16] Jonathan was recognized for his stellar performance when he was selected as United States
[00:04:21] Special Operations Command medic of the year for 2006. Jonathan has now applied his strong
[00:04:30] work ethic and sharp intellect to college where he is performing with equal distinction,
[00:04:35] having earned a 3.98 grade point average. His remarkable aptitude for math and science is
[00:04:43] reflected in his standing on the mortar board honor society, the deans list and first honors role.
[00:04:53] Additionally, his dedication to services represented in the many hours he has spent as a volunteer
[00:04:59] at both sharp memorial hospital and Balboa naval hospital.
[00:05:02] This academic prowess willingness to serve selflessness and duty and personal will to
[00:05:12] accomplish the mission even in the most severe combat situations are qualities so unique
[00:05:18] that I cannot fathom a more exemplary candidate for medical school.
[00:05:24] I am completely confident he will excel both in school and in the field and will make
[00:05:30] not only Harvard proud but also provide the finest and most compassionate medical care to
[00:05:37] every patient blessed enough to come under his charge.
[00:05:44] I would be more than happy to answer any questions about Jonathan Kim and his unlimited potential.
[00:05:50] Since nearly John G. Willink commander, naval special warfare group one training detachment.
[00:06:06] And that right there was a letter of recommendation. I wrote four, Jonathan Kim,
[00:06:15] otherwise known as Johnny Kim, for his acceptance into Harvard Medical School.
[00:06:25] And this was after I wrote him a letter of recommendation to be commissioned as an officer in the navy.
[00:06:30] And after I sat on his board for the commissioning program.
[00:06:36] But before I wrote him a recommendation for acceptance into NASA to become an astronaut.
[00:06:41] And Johnny was accepted into the officer program. He was accepted into college. He was accepted into Harvard.
[00:06:48] And he was accepted into NASA to become an astronaut. And it was easy to write those letters of
[00:06:54] recommendation because the person that Johnny was and is simply an outstanding individual in every way.
[00:07:05] And it was an honor to work with him and task unit bruiser. And it's an honor to have Johnny Kim here with us
[00:07:13] tonight to talk about his life and his lessons learned. And he's a humble guy. So I already know he's going to be
[00:07:18] mad at me for opening up with that grandiose letter of recommendation from all those years ago.
[00:07:26] But I will say Johnny, you brought it on yourself by achieving so much. So Johnny,
[00:07:32] welcome and thanks for coming on, Dennis. It's pretty bizarre to be sitting here with you right now
[00:07:39] after all these years. It is. Thank you for having me here. It's an honor to be here and thank you for the
[00:07:45] kind and generous and also undeserving words. I mean, listening to that story, it seems a world away.
[00:07:54] But at the same time, it seems like it just happened. Yeah, that's the way I think that's the way
[00:08:00] life is. And I think that's the way military for me. My military career is in chunks. And you know,
[00:08:07] I spent a chunk of time at Seal team one as a new guy. Then I spent a chunk of time at Seal team two
[00:08:13] as a young person. Then I spent a chunk of time in college. Then a chunk of time here. And
[00:08:18] those those chunks can be years long. But sometimes they just seem like they went by in 15 minutes.
[00:08:24] So, man, your story, which you're really just in the middle of right now, I guess. Let's just go back to the
[00:08:33] beginning and go through, you know, growing up and what that was like and we'll get through the teams.
[00:08:39] We'll get all the way up to sitting at this table, which, like you said earlier, is very strange for
[00:08:43] you and me to be in this position. And I don't think you want to let's ever thought we would sit
[00:08:47] doing what we're doing right now. Never. Let's do it. Right on, man. So where are you born?
[00:08:54] Los Angeles, California. And what was the scenario you grew up in?
[00:09:00] Yeah. So, first generation Korean American, my parents immigrated to the states. In the early 80s,
[00:09:07] a couple years before I was born, I was born in 84. And growing up for me was, there were some hard times
[00:09:19] growing up. I mean, I have always kept my growth, my childhood, close to the chest, even. Some of my closest
[00:09:29] friends I've never told how I grew up. No, it wasn't out of shame or anything, but I think it was
[00:09:35] a little bit, I think it's always been private for me. And it's been a part of my identity. And
[00:09:43] for a lot of the same reasons why I wanted to be a seal that freed we swore to to never really
[00:09:54] to do the things we do and not seek recognition for it. I've never, in that same vein, I never wanted
[00:09:59] to tell my story. But my dad was hard worker. He was uneducated. I think he, I don't know if
[00:10:12] he finished high school. But he grew up in a poor rural area in South Korea. And my mother was
[00:10:20] from a middle or well-to-do class family in South Korea. Her father, my grandfather, was a professor
[00:10:30] at Seoul University. And so they came over here and my dad worked for what he didn't have for education.
[00:10:39] He more than made up for with just pure grit and work ethic. And like a lot of Korean Americans,
[00:10:49] especially in Los Angeles, he owned a liquor store in downtown Los Angeles near South Central.
[00:10:59] And I think a lot of what I have become a lot of the decisions I've made in my life
[00:11:09] started with my father. And growing up, my father had, he had a lot of demons.
[00:11:22] Like a lot of people on the think he did the best he could to live within those, to live with those
[00:11:30] demons. But a lot of times he didn't have the mental strength to really not let those demons get
[00:11:40] a hold of him. And so much of what I've learned in my life has been what not to do by example
[00:11:50] of my father. And growing up, I mean, it seems, it just seems a different life to me now.
[00:12:01] Because I've had different experiences, so many humbling experiences. And I think about where I came from.
[00:12:08] It seems like a big accident. This seems like an accident to be sitting here with you talking about this.
[00:12:15] Everything I've done is an accident. Being a seal was an accident. Going to medical school,
[00:12:22] being a physician, being a national, those were all accidents, not part of the plan at all.
[00:12:29] All I wanted to do is to gain growing up was protect my family. Protect really my mother and
[00:12:35] my brother from my father. It was very abusive. And like a lot of family suffered from alcoholism.
[00:12:47] It's a pretty bad alcoholism. So when you were, when you were experienced that growing up at what age
[00:12:54] did you recognize that this was not normal? And it's hard to put a number on when I
[00:13:05] knew it was not normal. But I remember at a very young age having that feeling to protect my brother.
[00:13:12] My younger brother from it, you know, when the fights were going on or when the abuse is going on
[00:13:18] to try and shield him from it. Or, and I have a very distinct memory of actually trying to protect my
[00:13:24] mother one time and it didn't go well. And my mother also telling me to never do that again.
[00:13:35] Because I had a love. I should have not want to see me get hurt.
[00:13:41] And then at what age, at some age did you get to a point where you could step in and defend your
[00:13:48] mom? You know, yeah, I'm sorry to talk about such heavy things. And you get a, you get a
[00:13:58] podcast, but you know, you wanted to know how it all started off. Yeah, you know, that's why
[00:14:06] when I think about my life growing up, I was, I was a different, I was scared, I was a scared,
[00:14:13] little boy, scared of the world, scared of relationships, scared of talking to people,
[00:14:19] going to school, of having my own opinions of speaking up or fighting for what I believe is right.
[00:14:26] I was so scared, I was definitely scared my father. And, you know, it's just living on,
[00:14:38] living on egg shells to make sure to pray, you know, I pray every night, hoping that things
[00:14:45] would get better or that my, that my father would see the light and, you know, all those experiences
[00:14:58] while they were terrible at the time, I wouldn't take, I wouldn't trade any of that for anything,
[00:15:07] I would never want to trade that. Because everything that happened helped,
[00:15:16] formed me to the person I am today. And we'll talk about it, the teams helped
[00:15:22] channel that into good. So what point did you hear about the teams?
[00:15:34] So I was 16 years old and I would say being lost was probably a good description of how I felt
[00:15:45] up until that time. And I was, you know, it's like a martial arts thing with my buddies. And I was mostly
[00:15:52] just doing, because a couple of my buddies, Ryan Calam, some Keith Blum, were big into martial arts
[00:15:58] and I wanted to just hang out. And my buddy Keith told me with passion I've never seen before
[00:16:05] about the seal teams, about an ABCL. And this is 1999 or 2000. This is like no one knew what
[00:16:14] a seal is. It's a pre-911. I never heard what a seal was. And he told me with this passion about
[00:16:20] that quiet professional, that warrior that does these hard things that no one else wants to do,
[00:16:27] it never seeks recognition for those actions. And there was something about that,
[00:16:33] about that creed that deru me in a way I've never felt before. It called for me. And, you know,
[00:16:41] so I went home and went on my 56K modem and read everything I could about what it was as seal is.
[00:16:48] And I read a book that was pretty formative for me. It was the men with green faces by Gene
[00:16:56] Wenz. And my decision was made. And like this is what I'm going to do. And a week after discovering
[00:17:04] what it was, I told my mom, I'm going to be, I'm going to be an ABCL.
[00:17:09] And she had no idea what it was. You had to explain it to her. I assume.
[00:17:13] I mean, she just, she didn't know what it was. She just knew it was being
[00:17:19] a warrior, some type of soldier, an operator. And it was the last thing she wanted to hear from me.
[00:17:26] Did you get drawn to it? I mean, imagine, like, you know, you're saying that your whole life
[00:17:30] you felt scared and you felt weak and scared of your dad. Did you think, hey, if I do this,
[00:17:36] it's going to allow me give me the capability to protect people, including my mom.
[00:17:44] Absolutely. That is completely on point. You know, when people ask me why I want to be
[00:17:50] seal, it's so easy to come up with the superficial reasons. Like, yeah, I wanted to get paid to blow
[00:17:54] up stuff and jump out of planes and surf my country and shoot guns. But those are all fake
[00:18:02] superficial reasons. I didn't, those are absolute pluses, but that is not why I wanted to be a team guy.
[00:18:08] I wanted to be a team guy for what you said. I wanted to transform my life. I wanted
[00:18:14] to learn the skills, to develop the strength, to become a different person, to find my identity,
[00:18:21] be someone that could protect the people that I loved that couldn't protect themselves.
[00:18:26] And now that I have more awareness of human psychology and the experiences in our environment and
[00:18:33] how it shapes us into the people we become and the decision to we make, I realized that it was completely
[00:18:42] born out of my situation with my father and wanting to protect my brother and my mother and that
[00:18:52] extending to really all people. I thought, this is nice, it goes to show how little we know
[00:18:59] when we are young. I thought that being a seal would solve all of my life's problems.
[00:19:10] And it gave clarity and focus to so many, but it probably created just as many more.
[00:19:17] But it gave me tools to deal with those problems. But it was pretty naive thought,
[00:19:25] and I even said it to my mother. I said, being a seal will solve all of life's problems.
[00:19:33] Were you, so you're in high school, are you, are you doing sports or anything like that?
[00:19:40] Yeah, so I was a big swimmer, I played Waterpolo and after I found out what it was to be a team guy,
[00:19:46] I did all my research and I, what's a Stu Smith who I recently learned is in the world of
[00:19:55] kind of like making fitness, Navy Seal guidelines and workout plans. I found his book which is
[00:20:02] maybe like the first like first edition or second, you might be a later edition now and like
[00:20:08] did all those workouts and then you know, did it twice through and just tried to push myself
[00:20:14] every day after school and doing, I went to Hatsana, Marga High School, so the beach was three blocks away.
[00:20:20] So always doing swims and runs and a lot of calisthenics, a lot of pushups.
[00:20:25] Was you, what about school? Were you paying attention to school? Were you academically focused?
[00:20:32] I was, I felt like I was going through the motions of school and I did pretty well.
[00:20:38] And I always got straight A's, I did pretty well but I knew college was not for me. I did,
[00:20:46] I was lost, I didn't know what I wanted to do after high school but I knew it wasn't college.
[00:20:51] And so when I heard about the teams that calling, so this is what I'm going to do and it was
[00:20:58] it's too date, it is the strongest calling I've had.
[00:21:01] Yeah, there's, I have conversations with people a lot and
[00:21:09] man, that idea that you should go to college right after you get done with high school.
[00:21:14] I don't know if that's the best idea for everyone. I mean for some people it works, I get it,
[00:21:19] but you're a class example, I'm a class example, I mean when I ended up going to college later,
[00:21:24] hey, this is fine, you know, you're you're disciplined, you're focused, you can get stuff done,
[00:21:29] but yeah coming out of high school, I would have been just, you know,
[00:21:34] the focus is not there, you're not there for the right reasons. I think everything you do in life should
[00:21:39] be for the right reasons. In going to school after high school because that's what your parents told
[00:21:45] you to do and that's like the next default. It may work for some people, I don't think it's
[00:21:50] necessarily the right decision for a lot of people, like you said we're both prime examples of that,
[00:21:54] I think we both went to a new grad in our later years in life, I was like 26 or 27 when I went to
[00:21:59] undergrad. Were you worried about when you went in the Navy that you weren't going to be around your
[00:22:04] mom, you weren't going to be around your little brother, were you worried about them with your dad?
[00:22:10] I would have been, but my father actually passed away before I joined the Navy so I didn't have,
[00:22:16] I didn't have that worry. What age was that? How old were you?
[00:22:22] I just turned 18. So it was close. Yeah, it was close. February 21st, 2002.
[00:22:31] And was that, I mean, that had to be a weird feeling of this guy that had been abusive to you,
[00:22:38] your brother, your mom, and but he's still your dad. I mean, how did you, how did you,
[00:22:44] how do you wash out those feelings? Oh, it's a complex question. And just, you know, I,
[00:22:57] I want to be clearly, I have no ill feelings against my father and I have forgiven him
[00:23:03] of the years of abuse that he gave. And when I grew a little bit older and I entered,
[00:23:11] where he came from, he also came from a pretty terrible home situation. And I think his demons,
[00:23:18] he just didn't have the tools or the aptitude, the mental strength, the deal with those demons.
[00:23:24] And like a lot of people, they passed those on, right? The sins of our father passed on to us.
[00:23:29] And I don't fault him. And with the abuse, most of it was directed at my mother, you know,
[00:23:39] verbal and the physical abuse. I mean, it was not as direct with us. I mean,
[00:23:46] certainly there was, you know, the belts to the feet. And I remember,
[00:23:54] always kind of being scared to go to sleep sometimes because, you know, there were times
[00:24:02] where being woken up with a cold glass of water to the face was what would happen, or being woken
[00:24:08] up and being asked what of my possessions I had to choose what he would break. And front of me
[00:24:15] and I understand a lot of that was just to hurt my mother and he did a good job of doing that.
[00:24:19] And so he saw that hurting his children was the best way to actually hurt his mother.
[00:24:25] My mother was a very strong woman and so physically, or verbally, I'm using her, to a point.
[00:24:33] I was like, well, just bring it, it's not, but hurt my children. It's going to crush me. You know,
[00:24:41] when my father died, it, I feel like it was the day I was reborn into someone else.
[00:24:50] And I would probably have to backtrack and tell you the context of why I feel that way.
[00:24:55] I'm going to go back to my mother's life. Towards the later years of high school, my mother had
[00:25:05] had enough of the life she had been experiencing. And she would have left my father long ago,
[00:25:12] but it was really us, my brother, her Jeff, that she couldn't leave behind to my father. And there's
[00:25:20] no way my father would have left her, let her leave with us that was not going to happen.
[00:25:26] So, but there was time where she just couldn't be in the same household. So, for months at a time,
[00:25:36] she had worked at, or that she would actually sleep at a friend's house or go away.
[00:25:40] So at night time when my father came back, you know, the food, like my mother would prepare dinner
[00:25:45] and food, but she would be somewhere else. And this arrangement was going on and I think my father
[00:25:52] obviously not very happy with the situation. I thought it would go back to normal because
[00:25:58] there had been a period of time where my mother would leave for a little bit, but it always came back
[00:26:01] because like a lot of abuse and relationship, it's hard to leave that, right? And especially when
[00:26:07] the abuse or promises, they'll change and may change temporarily, but then goes back to their ways
[00:26:13] to classics story. But this time was a little bit different and I think my father knew that this
[00:26:20] time was different and was getting frustrated and I think seeing that there were little options
[00:26:28] left and I think maybe felt cornered and I think cornered animals can be dangerous.
[00:26:36] We were very dangerous, not that I think he was cornered but I think he felt that way.
[00:26:40] So on this particular day, I think it was February 21st, 2002, I was home with my mother and
[00:26:54] it was during the day and my father came home and he was supposed to be at work so I think it was
[00:26:59] a little surprising. And I remember when he came home, I could smell the whiskey on his breath
[00:27:08] so I know he was new, he was very intoxicated and it was just, I could feel something was different
[00:27:19] this time. There was attention and I knew I had to stick around and my mother was surprised and
[00:27:31] scared to see him there and they went the kitchen and I stuck close by in the couch in the living room.
[00:27:40] And I remember my father came out to me and some of the last words he said to me was, I'm sorry,
[00:27:49] Jonathan, I need to be afraid of my face and then all I hear in the kitchen is my mother
[00:28:01] screaming for help and saying he's got it gone. So I then, you know, fight or flight, you do what
[00:28:10] you need to do to protect the people you love. So I got up and I did my best to fight him and get that
[00:28:20] gun and fought as hard as I could as strong as I guess 140 pound your old kid could do at the time.
[00:28:32] But I lost that fight, I still have a scar right around here from when my father was
[00:28:43] he was able to get a hold of a dumbbell nearby and smash my head in with it and I think they
[00:28:50] kind of turned the fight and he was able to get his gun out of his pocket. He shot it in the air
[00:28:59] and it was, you know, that was the first time in my life that I faced a life or death situation
[00:29:10] and as you and I know there were many more to come later but for different reasons but this was my
[00:29:17] first taste of it and I don't know how maybe but I had the grace of God or something that I said,
[00:29:26] you know, I more clearly pleading with him that we loved him and that he didn't have to do this
[00:29:35] and that it wasn't. I'm clearly remember saying that it's not too late. Like this you have
[00:29:42] you have the power to decide right now it's not too late and I think maybe clarity or grace
[00:29:52] in a moment of clarity that my father found he decided not to shoot us not to kill us and I told
[00:30:00] them to go run just run and he did he went he left the back door and that was the last time I saw my father
[00:30:13] you know after that in the hysteria of that my mother was on the phone and called my one one
[00:30:19] and screaming for help and so eventually ambulances came and police came and I got you know I got
[00:30:26] my head stapled at the hospital I came back and the police were there right a report and I
[00:30:33] came back and to my room and I noticed that things had shifted I have a closet that has access to
[00:30:41] the attic and I noticed that there were furniture was moved in such a way to gain access to the
[00:30:48] attic and I told police that I think my father's still in the house and he's in the attic
[00:30:57] so they they did what they're trying to do they section off the area and confronted my father and
[00:31:05] one thing led to another I wasn't there but shots were fired and my father was killed
[00:31:18] and I remember that day so vividly it was I don't mean to sound countless but in in a lot of ways
[00:31:33] it liberated me liberated it's generally liberated my mother it was one of the hardest
[00:31:41] emo sad days for her but it liberated her and it liberated myself and my brother and it taught me
[00:31:51] it became the benchmark for me to do so many more things in my life because I don't think I was
[00:31:57] meant to be a seal I don't think I was born to do any of the things that I've had the opportunity
[00:32:05] to do but is because of those experiences being able to stand up to a person to a figure who I
[00:32:14] feared more than anyone and to be able to do something that I never thought I could be possible
[00:32:21] doing standing up to someone especially someone who was threatening to kill you and the person
[00:32:26] you loved most it was empowering it it it taught it liberated me taught me I'm not the scared little
[00:32:35] boy I thought I was I can do these things that I can be a part of something bigger than myself
[00:32:44] and you know I remember having so much foolish knife prod at the time I was naturally
[00:32:57] even 18 and just so angry with the world just having so much hate to my heart I think a lot of
[00:33:05] I had a lot of hate my heart as a kid when I see my child Christian who is full of happiness
[00:33:12] and carefree and it's like me in so many ways I see him and I realize that is the person I would have
[00:33:18] become and I want to protect that but with the life the card side been given I just had a lot of
[00:33:26] hate my heart and I refused to cry because I thought that was a form of weakness to cry for my
[00:33:35] father would pass then I never you know didn't cry at his funeral or anything and I remember
[00:33:43] that day on that day when my father died we went to the police department and I already know
[00:33:51] what had happened and I remember going in and there were three cops to the side and you could I
[00:33:59] I knew then and I also know just now of how warriors talk and the guy talking was motioning with
[00:34:08] his hands and he was recounting the story that led to my father's death and you know using his
[00:34:14] motions of how he entered and he saw us come in and my brother and was weeping and very
[00:34:22] naturally inconceivable and I was there and I think we made brief eye contact and I think I think
[00:34:28] I think I had the clarity and the respect to kind of stop what he was doing and realized that he was
[00:34:37] probably recounting a war story of someone he had killed and in this family which is walking through
[00:34:42] I haven't thought about that a long time but it just telling the story made me remember that
[00:34:47] and the police the detective I taught to he said son I'm sorry to tell you but your father
[00:34:54] is dead and this is one I want in a room and I just emotionalist just stone faced and he said
[00:35:04] I take it that this is not bad news it this is good and I said it I'm just relieved sir and he said
[00:35:27] I understand so
[00:35:28] and it's just a day for so many reasons that that helped me be reborn into the person I
[00:35:45] wanted to become that I've always wanted to become my entire life and I knew from there that
[00:35:51] maybe just maybe I had what it took to be a seal is there anything that you can think of
[00:36:03] because like that that's obviously just a harrowing story but at some point you
[00:36:13] or maybe it was some point along the way or maybe it was multiple points along the way but
[00:36:17] it's like you turn instead of turning towards the darkness right instead of becoming a person
[00:36:23] that's abusive instead of hating like you said you had hatred in your heart which could have
[00:36:29] turned you and just a completely totally different direction in your life
[00:36:35] is there anything that you can think of that made you look up and say you know this is for me right now
[00:36:40] you know this is my first time hearing this stuff and you know when you when you
[00:36:49] you applied to becoming an officer and become a PA I think that's what you originally applying for
[00:36:55] were you becoming trying to become a PA for me it's always being a physician okay so you're applying
[00:37:00] for the medical thing and I remember I'm sitting on your medical board and or your officer board
[00:37:06] and I'm with it's me as a seal and two like one regular officer and then like a doctor officer
[00:37:14] and I remember I said something along the lines of because you know me I kind of say whatever I
[00:37:19] want but I said something along the lines of like hey I don't like hospitals I don't like doctors
[00:37:25] I don't like nurses I don't like any of that stuff I have no idea why you would ever want to do this
[00:37:30] I don't know why you want to go being a hospital all day and I said but if I had to have someone
[00:37:38] taking care of my kids I would want it to be you because I knew you had this just um you that
[00:37:44] you were a very compassionate person that you really cared about other people I mean I saw that
[00:37:49] from day one with you and and now I'm I'll say now it's so obvious well part of it's obvious
[00:37:58] part of it's obvious that you can go with these experiences that you went through I mean we see it
[00:38:03] every day that people go in two directions with those you know when horrible things like that happen they
[00:38:07] can follow in those footsteps of of evil for lack of a better word or they can recognize that
[00:38:16] it's evil and they can go in the other direction which is what you did and I'm just wondering is
[00:38:21] there can you are there any pieces that you can put together that you can say to yourself well
[00:38:26] one of the things that you saw was this and this made you think you know what my the way my
[00:38:34] father acted was wrong and I'm not going to be that way it's a good question
[00:38:45] I don't think I have an answer for you I think that's a question that a lot of people would
[00:38:52] love answered especially with so much abuse and dysfunction in society in America all over the world
[00:39:02] we would love to know what it is that allows people to sublet me their bad experiences
[00:39:10] to channel it for a good cause and I'm not here to tell you I was never on the path to darkness
[00:39:20] I am by no means a saint or have always done good things I've done things that I'm not proud of
[00:39:32] I've sinned I sinned every day I try and keep that light there as a guiding path for good all the time
[00:39:44] and one of the reasons why I wanted to be a doctor was not because I was in love with medicine
[00:39:53] I mean I do like medicine but it's to serve to a cause greater than myself that leaves a
[00:40:01] positive mark in this world it's the same reason why I wanted to be an astronaut I think being a
[00:40:06] seal was maybe a little bit more selfish for the reason that we talked about because I wanted to
[00:40:10] be a part of I wanted to find my identity but I don't know I think my I think my mother had a large
[00:40:18] part into it she's one of the strongest women I know and seeing that strength and that selflessness
[00:40:28] and that sacrifice she fact sacrificed her dreams she could have been someone she's a smart woman
[00:40:35] she's a beautiful woman she didn't have to be with my father but I after having two boys
[00:40:48] and loving her children so much that she would sacrifice her dreams her potential to protect us
[00:40:55] I think that had a significant effect on me so if there's anyone to credit it would be my mother
[00:41:08] I don't I don't know if I don't know if I have the answer though
[00:41:15] well certainly seeing an example and you know I've been talking about this lately
[00:41:21] when you sometimes it's not easy to see something if there's not a contrast against it but for you to
[00:41:27] see the contrast of someone that's bad you know your dad doing bad things abusing weaker people I
[00:41:36] mean this is just you know they're just that's just bad and you might not have noticed
[00:41:42] how bad that was if it weren't contrasted so drastically against your mom who is making
[00:41:49] the ultimate sacrifice with her life and standing up for you and taking that abuse and staying in that
[00:41:56] situation because she wanted to take care of you kids and I think when you see that sometimes it
[00:42:03] makes things just more obvious it's something that you may not have seen otherwise if your mom was
[00:42:09] you know if your mom was just as abusive or she had her own problems or she was doing things that
[00:42:13] were wrong you you may have just thought that's the way the world is and that's the way you're going
[00:42:18] yeah but to be able to see oh it doesn't have to be like this and there's there's good in people's
[00:42:25] hearts is that that could be for a kid the difference you know I mean
[00:42:37] all good points sand it's so weird to be saying to be recounting this story I've never said this story
[00:42:46] publicly and you said yourself you've never heard this story well if you ask most guys
[00:42:53] from Charlie Bitton they have not heard this actually I think if you ask all about one maybe
[00:42:59] one person they have not heard this story and it's just something I kept close to my chest because
[00:43:08] everyone has their story I don't think my story is anymore important in anyone else's
[00:43:14] and we talked a little bit before this podcast but I'm a little at unease and still I am
[00:43:22] about being on a podcast like this because it's so I don't see I don't want to say it's contrary
[00:43:28] to my beliefs but it just requires being extra thoughtful and I think that create we all
[00:43:36] swore to to not advertise and promote the nature of our work and never seek recognition for
[00:43:47] that night take that creed too hard so it's weird for me to be recounting this story
[00:43:58] publicly and if it was up to me I'd keep it close to the chest for all my days but as I've grown
[00:44:04] older I've come to realize that there is value for other people I'm not the only person in this
[00:44:12] situation and frankly there are people in way we're situations than I am than I was in who are
[00:44:19] still in it for them to know that you can be born with bad cards you mean you don't need to have it all
[00:44:30] but you have a choice and the power to craft your own destiny your own path and for that reason I think
[00:44:40] it's a I think it is less important that I keep stuff like this close to my chest and then that's why
[00:44:49] I'm sharing it with you well that's that's one of the very reasons why this podcast even exists
[00:44:57] is for people to learn one of the people go through that they're not alone that things could be
[00:45:03] worse for them they could get better I mean that's so exactly what you said is the exact reason why
[00:45:10] sharing that story is is absolutely important because people can people can learn from it people can
[00:45:17] people can get over their own things that they're facing because they know that someone else did it
[00:45:22] I mean how powerful is it you know you hear the story all the time about the first guy it will
[00:45:26] banister broke the four mile time or the the four minute mile no one thought it was possible once he
[00:45:31] did it all kinds of people did it so just knowing that someone like you can go from this horrible
[00:45:36] place and do what you've done yeah that's a that's huge did these events as they unfolded
[00:45:45] impact your decision to join the Navy and at what point did you go down to the recruiter and
[00:45:50] sign up so I was so when my father died it was a few months before graduating high school and
[00:45:57] I was already depved in I had a shift date so I had already gone and signed the paperwork and I
[00:46:02] mean not the not the final dot in line that makes you in the Navy you know you raise your right
[00:46:07] hand and do the enlisted oath but my mind was set I mean my mind was set a week after
[00:46:14] Keith Blum told me what a Navy seal was back when I was 16 I mean they was clear like
[00:46:19] I'm going to do this and no one is going to be able to convince me otherwise and I talked to
[00:46:26] people and people asked me to like I think I want to be a seal and I don't know if this is a
[00:46:31] litmus test but I always try and convince people to not do it and I feel like if I can convince
[00:46:36] someone to not do it I just perhaps have saved them in the money a lot of time and money
[00:46:41] because if I can convince you to not be a seal then you probably will convince yourself
[00:46:46] at the first sign of suffering so but I was not convincedable you could not convince me to do anything
[00:46:55] and the conversation this is crazy you're I'm pulling up memories I have not thought of in years
[00:47:02] just the conversations I had crafted that I was planning to tell my father because I could not tell
[00:47:08] my father I was born in the Navy no way he would have you know you may have quite literally killed me
[00:47:19] I think that would have been very upsetting to him because he had a clear path for me and it was to be
[00:47:26] it was to be a doctor at Harvard Medical School and I promised you that is not why I went to
[00:47:31] Harvard Medical School but it was to do that and for me I was like there's no way I'm going to do that
[00:47:37] I'm not going to live your dream I don't want to be a doctor I don't want to go to an Ivy League school
[00:47:43] I want to be in the trenches I want to enlist I want to be the E1 working my way up learning from
[00:47:50] everyone else learning the ropes and roughing it being in the trenches with boys that's all I
[00:47:56] wanted to do and I crafted how I would tell my father I was actually going to join the academy and I was
[00:48:04] thinking I had this plan to go the exchange and like buying officers uniform so when I would come home
[00:48:10] I would like show up in an officer's uniform just to like maintain this perception to my father that
[00:48:16] I was in the academy and these are like the ropes the extent that I had planned because I was so
[00:48:23] afraid to tell my father and fortunately I didn't have to do any of that because my father died
[00:48:30] it sounds callous but it fortunately I did not have to go through that deceit because my father passed away and
[00:48:40] I don't mean to paint my father in a bad light really I love my father I do I could not have said that
[00:48:48] I was unable to say those words for a very long time would I do love my father and I understand he was
[00:48:57] human and fell to sin and his demons he just didn't have the clarity and the tools to deal with that
[00:49:08] and I forgive him for that so I don't mean to paint my father in a bad light and as I said before
[00:49:15] I would not trade those experiences for anything because they were formative and everything I am today
[00:49:21] started with those with that darkness when you were talking about going into
[00:49:33] whatever going into the recruiter and all that and I'm imagining what when I did it when I
[00:49:39] remember being because you were talking about feeling liberated before when your dad died
[00:49:47] I know that when I joined the navy man I felt like so awesome like I felt like I didn't need anybody else
[00:49:56] I was 100 like you had no one had any control over me anymore I just kind of at that moment when I
[00:50:01] signed that dotted line I now was in control of my fate even though most people would look at the
[00:50:06] opposite oh you're in the navy now and you're gonna have to follow orders and where uniforms and all
[00:50:11] this stuff to me it was complete and utter freedom that's what it felt like now you're so you
[00:50:21] graduate high school so did you graduate your 18 years old or your 17 years old I was 18 when I
[00:50:26] graduated high school and you go to navy boot camp yep how was that I'm still in the navy
[00:50:39] I'm an active duty lieutenant so I will maintain my level of respect and difference to the ways of the
[00:50:47] navy but navy boot camp is just wasn't as trying as I thought it would I think when you have the idea
[00:50:59] that you're gonna be a seal you prepare yourself for a different standard so when you go to boot
[00:51:03] camp you show up in slow it's just a little different yeah well the focus is on like attention to detail
[00:51:10] it's more of a pain I don't know more more more of a pain like you're like oh this is a pain
[00:51:16] because you're after make your bed and you have to fold your underwear a certain way you have to do all these
[00:51:19] things that more than their physical pain they're just a pain just a pain there's a rhyme and
[00:51:26] reason for what I do things and I think it was sure um you know when I I smile I chuckle in
[00:51:31] my smile when I think about navy boot camp because that's where it all started I mean I loved it
[00:51:36] I like you said you felt free I felt free I felt I had no one like you know when my dad died
[00:51:43] I just felt this weight on my shoulders just released like I had never felt before and for the first
[00:51:50] time I didn't have to worry about my brother or my mother so and I just wanted to get away
[00:52:00] I the teams the military it was it might take it to escape the childhood I was born into this
[00:52:07] idea of Jonathan that people had knew as a scared little boy I needed a reset button and the
[00:52:14] military was my reset button I'm gonna start a new with people I don't know who have no idea where
[00:52:21] I came from of my background and I am going to go through the ranks on my own merit and hard work
[00:52:28] and learn how to be led and lead others and it was the best decision
[00:52:37] I have ever made and um every time I say that I think of my wife because I think marrying my wife
[00:52:48] was the best decision I made but it's it's a little different you understand what I mean but
[00:52:53] it was the best decision for me in my growth and development to join the military and it's not
[00:52:59] like the private I'm not trying to sound like a recruiter join the military it's not for everyone
[00:53:03] but it was for me I would tell you that and well this is true for my wife for sure if I wasn't
[00:53:08] if I didn't join the Navy if I didn't go in the teams my wife a probably wouldn't have married me
[00:53:14] because I wouldn't have been the human that I am and to this day if like the reason that
[00:53:23] where happily married is rooted in the fact that I was in the days whether she likes to
[00:53:28] or not she knows it's true like you're you have that always and it's always a part of you
[00:53:36] so um it sounded like you were pretty well prepared for buds in terms of you played water
[00:53:42] polo you were a good swimmer you were working out on the beach in Santa Monica
[00:53:47] it sounds like physically you were you were pretty good to go
[00:53:51] I would say in most aspects I think I over I put an over alliance on
[00:53:57] calisthenics and body you just body weight exercises I mean I could crush the piece whatever
[00:54:02] they call you now the PST you know the time run and swim and pull ups and all that stuff I could crush
[00:54:09] that but you put weight on me you put a log on me you put a boat on me how much did you want
[00:54:15] to go on a boat I was a 140 45 pounds I'm 180 105 now I'm a lot stronger now than it was back then
[00:54:23] but I'm also a lot slower like I probably can run this fast it's back then but I didn't understand
[00:54:30] strength the way I do now I didn't incorporate barbells into my routine it was all body weight
[00:54:37] stuff so it was definitely an over alliance on the body weight exercises calisthenics running swimming
[00:54:44] and if I could redo it I would have eaten a lot more calories during buds or before but
[00:54:50] four buds just to be bigger and stronger and I would have swatted in warmer and yeah I would have
[00:54:56] squatted a lot and just just to say I mean I was shoulder presses bench press squatting dead
[00:55:03] less I would I didn't know that before preparing for buds and so I feel I was preparing but I
[00:55:11] wasn't prepared in that respect then was there anything that gave you like a real problems in
[00:55:17] buds like did you did you make it through one class did you get rolled back at all now I was
[00:55:21] lucky enough to make it through with two four seven and one shot you started with two four seven
[00:55:27] and then you graduated with two four seven did you fail anything no because you were comfortable
[00:55:35] in the water from water polo so you were real for different dive phase yeah I thought dive
[00:55:40] dive phase was was great um I was very comfortable being thrown around the water because you're
[00:55:46] right I mean just from playing water polo you used to being like people were trying to drown
[00:55:50] you in the ball so being thrashed around in pool comp wasn't a big deal I mean
[00:55:56] everyone's keep the water you were your own greatest enemy in the water right if you just
[00:56:03] maintain clarity and focus and calm your nerves everything will be okay it's when you thrash
[00:56:10] you panic you get air hungry that plays on you and that's when you really people have a
[00:56:16] hard time I think when it comes to water related activities well yeah that's that's why
[00:56:20] I immediately went to and you said all you made it through everything I immediately was like oh yeah
[00:56:24] you played water polo because what what is it that church people like okay you're gonna be tired
[00:56:29] that can trip some people up you're gonna be called they don't want to be called anymore so they
[00:56:34] quit like those two things hey running and swimming pretty much are sorry running pretty much
[00:56:39] like you're gonna get put on the grind there and you're gonna your your times are gonna drop
[00:56:44] and you're gonna be there's not to me people like it dropped for running it happens for sure
[00:56:49] it's not to me people like I drop for obstacle course water though that's that's the
[00:56:54] separator right so if you're comfortable in the water going to buds man you have a huge
[00:56:59] leg up because all those little things you just rattled off as if it's no big deal like
[00:57:02] don't panic don't get air hungry like that's real easy when you're a water polo play but for
[00:57:06] these dudes from Iowa that didn't grow up in the water you know unless they grew up on a lake
[00:57:12] somewhere well I mean there were some guys in my class there was one guy I'm particularly
[00:57:16] that was from Iowa and he was a wrestler and he was strong and he was fast and he was an incredible
[00:57:22] shape and the dude sank and he just panicked in the water was in climate equipment yeah you know so
[00:57:27] I think that's a big a big separator but I have so much respect for the folks who didn't have
[00:57:33] that kind of background of being so comfortable with the water I don't want to say his name because
[00:57:38] he's still active and he's over at damn neck but let's say it's just his first name my buddy Tyler
[00:57:46] who I went through he was like my sister division in boot camp and I have so much respect for
[00:57:53] Tyler for just the way he carries himself and how he's just a very hard man but he showed up
[00:57:59] to boot camp and didn't know how to do the sidestroke that's insane and he learned in the
[00:58:04] locker room before the PST and this guy is like one most squared away and prepared guys ever
[00:58:10] and to this day I gave him like I'm like how did you show up and not know how to do the sidestroke
[00:58:16] but just from sheer willpower he made it through and and like performed very what we were
[00:58:23] swim buddies dive buddies so he performed very very well so I was I just chuckle and so I have a
[00:58:30] lot of respect for people who are not comfortable but through sheer willpower will get knocked out you
[00:58:37] know that 50 meters swim if you've played waterholder swim that's not a big deal to do 50
[00:58:42] meter underwater swim it gets uncomfortable sure but there are folks who go to they go to the light right
[00:58:50] they they go unconscious and I have so much respect for that level determination like I would rather die
[00:58:59] they can give up and you know and I don't know I had to get props to that was there anything that
[00:59:07] was there any moments in buddha where you were like man I don't know if this is from here
[00:59:10] did that not even cross your mind so I want to I want to be clear I was not a stellar performer
[00:59:15] but I was middle of the pack runner swimmer everything with the long stibotes you know there's a
[00:59:22] standard to hell wiggies it's not just don't quit you need to perform to a standard and for me
[00:59:28] I just wanted to make it clear I was giving my heart and everything I did so that my
[00:59:36] I cared more about what my boat crew thought then then my instructors there was one
[00:59:44] instructor who I still remember instructor Megan I think just had it out for me but you know
[00:59:52] just just a skinny kid from from Los Angeles and I cared so I just wanted to put all I was like
[01:00:00] if I just put out put out my boat crew looks at me and and I remember I got my boat crew Nick
[01:00:07] Jack who who passed away during hostage rescue who gave the ultimate sacrifice
[01:00:16] him and my buddy Steve another guy there gave me that reassuring like hey you belong here and that's
[01:00:24] that meant so much to me so a lot of times I don't understand when a person who is in buddha
[01:00:30] and is not a performer and everyone else wants him to quit how they could like be there because
[01:00:36] I care so much about what my brothers think that if they didn't want me there I would never be there
[01:00:42] I would never want to slow anyone else down I don't know to answer your question
[01:00:51] you know there were certainly hard times I don't think there was ever a time where I wanted like
[01:00:56] I'm gonna quit but there was definitely times where I wanted the pain to stop and one
[01:01:01] particular time I remember it was you know that two hour nap you get in buds or in hell
[01:01:06] week yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:01:09] the warm sleeping bag on a cot and they wake you up I don't know if they still do this but they
[01:01:13] wake you up and they just whisper like get up and hit the surf and like the nicest most
[01:01:19] compassionate voice and it disarms you right because it they have circumvented that fight or flight
[01:01:29] response right you don't have you you don't mount that defense you just immediately get
[01:01:33] woken up very nicely and get sent to the cold water and that was the closest where I was like
[01:01:40] I want this to stop I want this pain and suffering to stop but as far as like being like I want
[01:01:47] to quit or I'm going to quit that wasn't there for me yeah that's totally understand why
[01:01:53] you always hear that thing that everyone thinks about quitting and I'm like I didn't think about
[01:01:57] quitting I know I was like whatever bring it yeah I think there's a difference between wanting
[01:02:02] to thinking about quitting and thinking about just wanting it to stop yeah well definitely sucks yeah
[01:02:09] but you know what I was like you said you felt free when I showed some buds and I got wet and
[01:02:14] sandy I got my buddy Jordan Lewis I got a picture of when we first got wet and sandy in white shirts
[01:02:18] and we're just beaming with smiles or the selfie just like I was so happy to be there
[01:02:23] I'm so happy to be starting my journey of embracing that suffering and sucked what years it
[01:02:30] right now when you what year did you go to buds so to four seven started in early two thousand
[01:02:36] spring in 2003 spring summer 2003 so we were in hellwaken fall 2003 and then we you know
[01:02:44] graduate buds in 2004 early so you know you're going to war or at least hope and you are
[01:02:49] yeah I mean absolutely when you know people ask me to join cousin 911 and I mean frankly I
[01:03:00] already told you that's but I joined for very I think more selfish reasons but 911
[01:03:05] only galvanized me to want to join even more if anything it just just how naive I was I was a little
[01:03:14] bummed out this is my 18 year old self saying oh the war's gonna be done by the time I get there
[01:03:20] I missed it I'm 18 years old this is 2002 and I could not have been any more wrong
[01:03:30] but of course when at that time especially in my development I I wanted war I think
[01:03:40] I think it's hard articulate why I'm gonna but a lot of people feel this way who trained to do
[01:03:45] something they want that and I don't know how I'm sure we can talk at lengths about how we each
[01:03:53] now feel about the experiences we've gone through and I wouldn't trade for anything but war is
[01:03:58] I don't know about you but it was pretty ugly yeah for sure you know I had I was on a
[01:04:05] guy named Sam Harris's podcast and he called me out because you know I I talk about how like
[01:04:11] leading men in combat is the best thing in my life and and then I also say war is absolute you know
[01:04:17] the most horrible thing in the world and he goes how do you how do you reconcile those two things
[01:04:22] and the way I explained to him I said if you ever met somebody that has cancer that survives
[01:04:26] and when they get through they say they say you know I'm glad it happened to me because they learned
[01:04:33] so much they don't would never wish it on anybody well that's that's pretty much exactly how
[01:04:38] I feel about war I've never heard that analogy but I think it's on point I would never trade it
[01:04:44] for anything and I would go back in the trenches right now in a split second with my brothers
[01:04:51] I would go back in that environment right now but I would never wish it on my own children and I hope
[01:04:57] they never see it you get done with buds and then you you when did you know you're gonna be
[01:05:08] going to age you go to 18 delta I did yeah so when I talk about accidents like that was another accident
[01:05:17] so you know their critters are they have a difference between accidents and luck
[01:05:21] could you keep calling things accidents some of it sounds like it might be a little bit more
[01:05:27] luck some of it's luck that you made accidents I don't know I think I think what I'm trying to
[01:05:34] point out is that there wasn't a plan God not a plan at all I mean plan for me was just
[01:05:42] I like to told you all I wanted to be was a seal I had no idea no aspirations to be a
[01:05:48] physician to be an astronaut I just want one goal at a time that's really important to me
[01:05:53] even to this day that you have one singular goal because you should be all in and what you're doing
[01:06:01] you should be genuine in what you're doing not have some social climbing some some professional
[01:06:07] ladder that you're trying to meet these goals and be stepping stones and why I said accidents
[01:06:13] because I didn't want to be a corpsman in fact I wanted to be an intelligent specialist because
[01:06:19] the sounded cool or an operation I had no idea what an IS or an OS which is the rating for those
[01:06:27] to job didn't I just sounded cool but I would have shipped out later and I'm like I want to
[01:06:33] ship out as soon as I want to go away as soon as possible what's the rate that will get me there
[01:06:38] the fastest it's it's done you got to be a corpsman what's a corpsman well you do this stuff you
[01:06:43] did you you're a hospital stuff I don't want to do that don't like I want to be on the mission like
[01:06:49] if I like in the unlikely event I made it through I don't want to be the medic that doesn't
[01:06:54] get to do any cool stuff come to find out that's completely not true at all so that's why I say
[01:07:01] it's an accident plan it that way and after SKT seal qualification training I got sent to
[01:07:09] for brag to learn how to be a combat medic and then how long is that scroll that was six months
[01:07:16] and he never told you that this is where someone lied to you because whoever told you the
[01:07:19] fastest way to get to the teams is to be a corpsman was just wrong well I think for me I was okay
[01:07:26] with that because I had already I just wanted to get the but and you know fast as fast as fast
[01:07:32] way the buts was go corpsman the fast way to join the navy just to get like because I'm like
[01:07:38] it means talking on recruiters so I want to get out of here as soon as possible what do I need to do
[01:07:43] you need to be a corpsman okay I'll be a corpsman whatever figure it out later when you got to
[01:07:48] when you started doing 18 delta the the school the medic school did you start did you find it
[01:07:54] interesting were you kind of like wow this is cool absolutely I'm fascinated by anything that's
[01:07:59] challenging if it's engineering space medicine anything that challenges you it's fascinating like
[01:08:06] so I thought it was completely fascinating I loved I came to learn that medicine is pretty cool like
[01:08:11] and I took it seriously like though I didn't want to be the medic I understand the gravity of
[01:08:18] that that kind of honor that you are interested with the lives of your teammates that's a huge
[01:08:23] honor and I take it seriously so once the decision was made that I'm going to do that I was all in
[01:08:28] like I'm going to be the best medic I can be and being an 18 delta honestly those six months
[01:08:33] were more difficult than any time I had an uncle school because it's so much material crammed
[01:08:38] into six months on how to be a trauma combat medic and you learn a lot of skills I mean you learn
[01:08:43] how to do chest tubes which is a procedure that physicians train years through medical school
[01:08:51] and residency to learn how to do and you learn how to do that in six months crazy procedures life
[01:08:58] saving procedures and I had to give props and respect to the army because I think that they train
[01:09:07] the best medics really and I think that their culture surrounding combat medics is on point to maintain
[01:09:14] that currency so I had a great time at Fort Brakes on the best places to be stuck in but I had a
[01:09:21] great time learning from our army brothers and sisters yeah the the way that we train our medics
[01:09:28] and the the feats that they're able to perform on the battlefield are awesome keeping guys alive
[01:09:33] it's it's it's amazing did so you get done with that and for some reason
[01:09:43] you show up at sealed team three and what was sealed team three on deployment when you showed
[01:09:46] up or what was going on yeah somehow you ended up going to sniper school right I know
[01:09:50] which is totally ridiculous it is so for anybody that doesn't know if you're a new guy in the
[01:09:55] sealed teams you don't get to go to sniper school normally a guy's going one puttune maybe even
[01:10:01] two puttunes maybe even three puttunes before a guy gets the the honor of going to one of the most
[01:10:07] coveted schools in the sealed teams which is the sniper school it's a hard school but it's a
[01:10:14] call that everybody wants everyone wants to go to that school and somehow accidentally luckily
[01:10:21] whatever you want to call it you show up to team three and you go right to sniper school as a
[01:10:26] medic which is another school that everybody wants because it's a great quarks also and you can
[01:10:30] you've got an actual an actual marketable skill as a human being besides like hey I can walk
[01:10:37] point and shoot a machine gun that doesn't go get you anywhere but hey I can save people's lives
[01:10:42] that's a huge skill and you're getting two of the best skills that the that the seal team has to
[01:10:47] offer as a new guy undeservedly absolutely you know I change and I also change my viewpoint of
[01:10:55] medics because I didn't realize I was going through SKT tie woods I'm sure you know passed away
[01:11:03] he was one of my instructors in SKT and he's a medic he was a corpsman too and he was like dude don't
[01:11:08] you know that the medic always has to go on the mission it always gets to go always goes like
[01:11:13] what are you talking about what you don't want to be the medic so that changed my perspective on
[01:11:18] medicine in the teams because I just wanted to be a shooter like you know and no disrespect
[01:11:25] to the officers of the seal teams but I want to be the one pulling the trigger I wanted to
[01:11:29] want it to be in the deepest of the trenches I know you understand where I'm coming from because
[01:11:33] you were enlisted before you became an officer and I have no idea how I got snipers go I showed up
[01:11:41] team three was selling deployment and they're like new guy go to sniper school
[01:11:45] Roger that I will and for me you know I I I had you know I had an awareness of where I
[01:11:55] stood on the tone of play I knew his new guy I knew I was smaller statue and I just wanted to
[01:12:00] prove myself I was just so hungry to do a good job and so I knew sniper school is going to be
[01:12:07] hard but like man I'm not going I'll do everything to not fail this and bring this asset to
[01:12:12] the pitoon and I'm so thankful of whoever it was that allowed me to go to sniper school as
[01:12:18] the new guy before team three showed up from deployment how'd you do in sniper school I so it's like
[01:12:25] three I don't know how it is now it's three phases you know the first phase is like pay because
[01:12:29] like photographic image capture where you basically learn how to use a nestle lock camera to take
[01:12:34] facial recognition pictures basically for you know SR or special reconnaissance and that's all
[01:12:40] geek stuff like using computers setting up a network, sending you know sending pictures through
[01:12:46] radio waves I love that stuff and and that was came naturally to me the second part was scouting
[01:12:51] and scouting you also have to pass the you have to get a certain score on the rifle on the
[01:13:00] stocking the stocking and the rifle of course like you know 200 yard marine core test
[01:13:07] data penultin we would have to do which is a pretty hard test it's all iron sights and I
[01:13:12] never shot a gun I was gonna say that's why I was asking you this question because you know
[01:13:16] like I already said most people going to sniper school have at least one deployment if not two or three
[01:13:21] and you know you shoot thousands and thousands around every workup and deployment so you're improving
[01:13:26] your skills but you were coming right out of buds going to that with very you know with no experience
[01:13:31] yeah I mean you shoot very minimum you're like you don't know you don't learn how to be a sealant
[01:13:34] bud you just learn how to suffer and then you go to SKT and you get a little taste of what's
[01:13:39] like to learn some tactics but you don't really know anything still and you get to shoot a little
[01:13:43] bit but it's it's not that much so I didn't have that much and like I didn't grow up in a
[01:13:47] rural area where I had access to guns and so I didn't shoot I had very little shooting experience
[01:13:53] showing up to sniper school so that was hard and actually if I remember this correctly there was a
[01:14:00] point where I almost did not make it through because you had to get a certain score on the rifle
[01:14:07] but something clicked I mean if you just stick with the point to perform it's front sight focus
[01:14:12] body positioning fall through breathing they work yeah right and you just you you just I don't know
[01:14:23] if it's rounds or just perspective but eventually things clicked for me and I started to do
[01:14:30] actually pretty well in the shooting part and the stalking was also something I struggled with but once
[01:14:36] I learned the person the I just had to geek it out just kind of dissect what stalking is and
[01:14:44] all stalking is it's really too phase of it right you have dead space right so if what dead space is
[01:14:51] is if you know if you have a known observer you put a piece of earth between you and the observer
[01:14:58] line of sight that person cannot see you you could have a parade in that lane of dead space
[01:15:06] and you could just walk your merry way because stalking was a time revolution but it was also
[01:15:12] you had to get a certain qualification by certain amount of time if you had all day then it'd be a lot easier
[01:15:18] and obviously if you don't have dead space then you have to just have to learn the human
[01:15:22] physiology all it's like the human eye is attracted to movement especially a night
[01:15:27] so if you understand that and just slow your role be cautious be thoughtful at every step you take
[01:15:33] every movement be slow methodical with your stalking to get to that shooting position to take that
[01:15:40] shot the things become a lot easier and took me so that phase was was hard and I think I
[01:15:49] actually may have almost failed out if I remember correctly but I was able to get through
[01:15:53] and the last portion was the actual shooting portion and that came much better for me I think
[01:16:01] I learned those points performance and sticking with that and I loved the math behind
[01:16:09] shooting at long range and people think like how hard is you just put a redical on what you're trying
[01:16:15] to shoot and like that's not what the sniper is you very rarely are shooting by putting your
[01:16:21] redical on a target like yeah sure if you have the time to dial and click into your windage in your
[01:16:30] dope which is another word for elevation sure you put your redical on that and that's perfect
[01:16:36] great but in the real world there's changing winds there's moving targets and there are targets
[01:16:44] of opportunity that are not sighted into your two or 300 yards that your scope is at it might be a
[01:16:51] target that's 600 yards and you're doped in at 300 or target that's 100 yards and you're
[01:16:55] doped in at 300 so you have to learn these math problems like well if there's a left to right wind
[01:17:01] I know that and I have to aim to the person you know to the right side of the person's body
[01:17:08] or maybe it's an extreme wind so I'm gonna be more conservative even even further to left
[01:17:14] or the person is further than I'm doped in so I'm gonna make sure I'm aiming one or two
[01:17:19] body links higher than the person right it's a math problem and it's it's an art so I loved
[01:17:26] the geeky side of that so I mean I was all about it and I was I was so happy and so I felt so
[01:17:35] privileged to have to gain that skill set to bring back to my普通 so now you get done with that
[01:17:42] and that school actually overlap with the beginning of tasking a bruiser and a work up so
[01:17:47] you showed up late as a new guy to our desert training facility out in the Imperial Valley Desert
[01:17:56] and I actually remember when you showed up very very clearly and there's a backstory that I'm
[01:18:01] not sure you know about this so we're out there at the desert training facility and
[01:18:09] you know some of the more senior guys had hazed the shit out of some of the guys
[01:18:16] and I saw what's going on and they were doing they did some stuff that was like dumb and so I
[01:18:23] grabbed the chiefs and I was like hey guys I got a talk to you so it was the it was the two
[01:18:28] 普通 chiefs and and the the task unit senior to the vice-versa I was like hey guys got a
[01:18:34] talk to you we got side I was like listen guys I get it you guys need to tighten up this is
[01:18:41] bullshit you know like look I get what you're doing I get that this stuff takes place it's okay
[01:18:47] but if you're gonna be stupid about what you're doing we're all gonna get in trouble and it's
[01:18:52] gonna be a problem so tighten it up and don't only see this shit anymore and the guys are like
[01:18:57] hey Roger that I literally walk inside the compound or I walk back inside the building
[01:19:05] and you and you had showed up like while I was talking to those guys and you got welcomed to your
[01:19:10] tattooed by getting you know assaulted and your head partially shaved like they didn't do a good job
[01:19:20] and so I'm standing there and I come walking walking in and someone's like hey Kim go report to
[01:19:29] the commander you have no idea who I am but they they're like pointing at me and you look like you just
[01:19:34] I mean your eyes are freaking giant and you just look like you just walked into into the
[01:19:40] craziest things you've ever seen and you come walking ready you got a ball cap on and I'm looking
[01:19:46] at you and you're standing at a position of attention I mean it's just hilarious and and I'm looking at
[01:19:52] your hair and I can see that the guys have obviously just roughed you up and partially like
[01:19:59] shaved chunks out of your hair I do like serum on belly officer Kim or I'm HM3 Kim or HM2 Kim
[01:20:06] whenever you were I'm reporting on board and I was like hey bro nice to meet you man
[01:20:10] and just something really chill like that but that was pretty funny that's the backstory
[01:20:15] the guys meet just literally tighten them up and tell them not to be idiots and I walk in
[01:20:21] and four seconds later I'm meeting you and it looked like you just got slapped around and you're
[01:20:27] head shaved that's I have never heard that backstory yeah it's amazing yeah I got I got
[01:20:36] well cut that I think it was a mallet that I think I had a mallet that was given a mallet
[01:20:43] that's right because you had really long hair too coming out of sniper school and I would
[01:20:47] see you in a while oh yeah long hair they weren't gonna have no this is who is this new guy showing
[01:20:52] up long hair yeah not totally asked for it but you know so many emotions when you show up
[01:20:59] your petoni like a lot of guys I was just so hungry to be accepted to be a good job like
[01:21:05] look I can put out I'm gonna ask it like I want to be here because I want to be here
[01:21:11] and getting welcome like that was I I wanted that and it's a different world I feel like I was
[01:21:18] fortunate enough to see two sides of the Navy because that is certainly not at all condoning
[01:21:26] that behavior but it is what it is it is what it was and I've kind of at the cost where I got to
[01:21:33] see that side of the teams and I'm sure it's still those on but it's changed a little bit right
[01:21:38] but it changed a lot it was on a glide slope the whole time that I was in I mean when I first showed
[01:21:43] up to the teams it was it was dumb and out of control you know and what you know and just like
[01:21:48] what you're saying like there's parts where you go oh yeah that made sense and then there was
[01:21:52] other people that were just idiots and it was totally out of control and it needed to be tightened up
[01:21:57] and and I saw that glide slope the whole time I was in and you know it got to a point where
[01:22:02] which is what it was kind of like for us like hey idiots what are you doing if I'm the commander
[01:22:07] and I see what you idiots are doing you're wrong you know and don't be stupid and don't do
[01:22:12] things that you're going to get in trouble I mean just dumb stuff you know so there's you know
[01:22:19] unfortunately it's a hard thing to police because in order to police it you'd have to say okay
[01:22:25] you can do this but you can't do that hey when I when I first joined I was on a ship and we
[01:22:30] went across the the dam a quater and it was a you know you become a divvierver her to this
[01:22:35] you become a shell back yeah yeah so I did that it was one of the worst hazing sessions I ever
[01:22:40] had it was completely condoled by the entire U.S. Navy let's a shell back um someone that has
[01:22:47] been over the equator so if you if you've you've never crossed the equator then you then you're uh
[01:22:53] then you're uh what's it a walk I think it's a polywag or a wag but they call you a wag and then
[01:22:58] once you go across the the equator you go through this big ceremony which is just a big hazing session
[01:23:04] then you become a trusty shell back which is okay yeah and I mean they did everything that
[01:23:10] that would happen and like you know they were dunking their feeding crappy foods they were
[01:23:15] beating you with like um uh cut off fire hoses it was legit hazing yeah and of course
[01:23:23] some of that stuff you go okay I get it it's a tradition it's a welcome aboard like you said it's a
[01:23:27] welcome and of course there's people at our idiots that take too far and that's what you
[01:23:32] that's what you end up having to correct for you have to have end up having to correct for
[01:23:36] people that are stupid people that are sadistic people that don't have any common sense
[01:23:41] and it turns into a problem so yeah everything you said is on point I think you have to understand
[01:23:48] the we intent behind an action right if it's malicious which sometimes it turns malicious for some
[01:23:54] people that's not right now if it's a way to welcome someone aboard a field part of you know
[01:24:01] the brotherhood the sisterhood like welcome this is what it's like um I think the spirit of that is
[01:24:09] I understand the spirit of that but you're right it it requires people to be judicious to have
[01:24:17] to exercise good common sense and unfortunately that doesn't always happen yeah and the blanket
[01:24:23] thing that happens in a big organization like the Navy is they okay look we we don't know how to
[01:24:28] we don't know how to judiciously do this we don't want to put regulations around it so we're not
[01:24:31] doing it anymore and you know that was actually one of the worst things that used to happen if there
[01:24:36] was a guy that people that that a platoon sort of rejected like an organ rejection where you know you
[01:24:44] get a kidney transplant and your body can reject it sometimes that happens in a platoon and and what
[01:24:50] would happen it wouldn't it be the opposite it'd be like that guy's not getting hazed he's not
[01:24:55] getting you know rassed by the troops people aren't making fun of him for this that or the other thing
[01:25:01] that's when you that's when you know a guy's a real problem is when he's actually so far outside
[01:25:05] that's spectrum that they go you know what we don't even we don't even want to we don't even want to
[01:25:10] do that with this guy because he's not one of us and we don't want him as part of the team
[01:25:13] wise words I've always heard that I believe it if if you weren't getting rattle if you weren't
[01:25:21] being made fun of then people didn't like you and that's just the coach I think it's hard for
[01:25:26] people outside of that community to understand why we were so hard in each other and why it was
[01:25:33] born out of love it really is it's a a lot of those actions and you just the way we conducted ourselves
[01:25:41] and I mean some of the people closest friends we were just you know just dog on each other all the
[01:25:48] time to this day yeah it's it's a it's a I guess weird environment to grow up and because I'm like
[01:25:55] you like I joined the Navy when I was 18 and that's what you that's what you you just go into this
[01:26:01] environment and it's just like you're saying when I got into that environment I was like this is so
[01:26:07] awesome this is the coolest thing ever this is the people I want to be around with forever and yeah
[01:26:13] you know what if you got out of line you would get tightened up you would get tightened up and you know
[01:26:18] that's something I I've talked about is like in task unit bruiser I'm the commander of task
[01:26:24] in bruiser the amount of times that I personally had to tighten up a guy for being late was zero
[01:26:31] the amount of times I had to personally tighten up a guy for forgetting his gear was zero
[01:26:35] the amount of times I had to tighten someone up for being out of uniform was zero because the
[01:26:39] freaking gang took care of that and the gang was gonna make sure that we were square it away
[01:26:43] and and that's what that mentality is kind of like it's kind of like a gang mentality as it should be
[01:26:50] in that respect yeah yeah um but that was your welcome aboard was that was um funny so and so
[01:26:59] then all of a sudden you're you're dropped into the middle of work up and now you see the
[01:27:05] now you see what now you see what actually being a seal is about is lilies like now
[01:27:10] that that first trip mm-hmm did it meet your expectations it did absolutely and and exceeded
[01:27:18] what expectations I had no I didn't have a benchmark of what a normal put tune was and actually
[01:27:27] I think I just kind of thought all let me let me back up a bit what I've done to the teams
[01:27:35] is a drop in the bucket compared to what you've done and what a lot of our brothers have done
[01:27:42] you know I've got friends who've done ten plus deployments to take that one step further
[01:27:46] you say what you've done in the teams is a drop in the bucket compared to me which is not
[01:27:50] completely accurate but even if you accept that fact what I've done in the teams is a drop in the
[01:27:55] bucket compared to other guys that were in in longer time better time more extreme situations
[01:28:04] so yes it goes without saying that both of us look man we I mean for me I did what I could do
[01:28:11] while I was in you did what you could do while you were in but goes it doesn't go without saying
[01:28:16] we're both saying it what we did in the teams it was a fraction a little miniscule compared to
[01:28:22] you first of all the teams as a whole and second of all plenty of individuals who are way better
[01:28:29] waste martyr did ten times the deployments that you and I did which is crazy to think about
[01:28:34] but that's what happens so yes in that extent the other services like arm marine
[01:28:41] core brothers and sisters for sure armies holders air force I mean just drop in the bucket but
[01:28:47] in that context I didn't know what a like a normal but tuned was so I kind of thought all
[01:28:53] put tunes were like Charlie Pintune a task in a bruiser and I've come to realize later on
[01:28:58] that we were maybe a little more aggressive than the average man the average task unit
[01:29:04] but I loved it and that's I was finally in the situation that I wanted to do
[01:29:10] that I felt a calling to when I was growing up in my adolescent years that I felt I was born to
[01:29:16] do and for the first time I felt accepted I never felt accepted growing up not even
[01:29:28] sure I had friends and you know I went to a Korean church and I had some Korean friends
[01:29:35] from my parents but in a lot of ways I was always felt in between worlds and that had an impact
[01:29:41] on me like I didn't really feel well accepted by the by in a lot of ways the Korean American
[01:29:49] community because I was I remember just being teased just because I was like too white
[01:29:56] I think one time I had I had skateboarding shoes when I went like my Korean church and I just got
[01:30:02] made fun of it for and I just you know so I just just kind of funny to think about and I think
[01:30:08] it just laughed at all like it's just ridiculous but when you're a kid and that's your world
[01:30:13] it means a lot so I never felt like I was accepted to a group until I was in the teams
[01:30:21] and I was for the first time I was home and I loved it.
[01:30:30] I you know I had to go to college in the middle of my co-career and I was talking to a professor
[01:30:37] and my professor I was saying to this professor well you know I just can't wait I was just kind
[01:30:44] of finished this course because I so I can get back to the teams and the guy was looking at me
[01:30:48] like I was completely insane like I was completely crazy because the war had started and I'm saying
[01:30:54] I just want to get this so I can get out of here so I can go back to the teams and he's looking at me
[01:30:58] like I'm literally like I'm crazy and he says like whoa like don't you like going to school
[01:31:06] and when you rather just stay here next to two semesters and and you know just go to classes and
[01:31:10] run and I was like oh I said I would leave right now if the Navy would let me I would leave right
[01:31:16] now with no degree I don't care about this and he's like why it was incomprehensible to him and I
[01:31:23] sat there and I looked at him and I said and it sounds really freaking horrible to say this I guess
[01:31:28] if you put it in the in the view of identity politics but I look at him and I go because in the
[01:31:34] teams everyone's like me and I don't mean it that they're like me that they're that they're white
[01:31:41] males I mean they're like me and it doesn't matter what background they come from it doesn't
[01:31:47] matter if they're Korean or Mexican or black or white it doesn't matter they're like me they're
[01:31:53] think they're gonna laugh at the same stupid jokes they're gonna they're gonna throw daggers at me
[01:31:58] that I'm gonna expect to be able to deal with I'm gonna throw daggers back at them that's and
[01:32:02] if things get escalated they can get out of control and they'll get we'll go toe to toe that's
[01:32:07] what happens in the teams and then we'll shake hands and have a beer and so that feeling of
[01:32:13] when you get to a platoon and you're like oh thank you world because now you put me with these other
[01:32:21] dudes and they're like me and we can take we can take on it's us against the world
[01:32:27] that's a damn good fuel it's a brotherhood and it's hard to articulate that feeling that you
[01:32:34] described but for all those things you said yes so let's talk a little bit more about work up
[01:32:42] and you know the desert training to me there's no better way to start off a work up than going through
[01:32:49] that desert training it's hard it was August it was 120 degrees outside it was brutal we were
[01:32:58] thirsty we were tired and we were getting after it there's nothing lankin I think my I clearly
[01:33:08] remember that first night and they were like let's go in a little patrol little shake out patrol
[01:33:14] shake out patrol and this so guys like all right I'll maybe bring a cantine I'll bring a leader maybe
[01:33:22] half of this camel back well maybe he's won't bring anything I'll be good and the shake out patrol
[01:33:29] became like an all night patrol of just marching through in this heat and it's nighttime but it's
[01:33:37] still sweltering hot and I remember folks just running out of water
[01:33:42] rare here early on I think Ryan Joe I don't even know if you brought any water and just
[01:33:47] suffering through it but things like that stick with you that kind of mutual suffering and
[01:33:56] hardship I I'm a firm believer that hard shared hardship and suffering is one of the best ways
[01:34:07] to bring people together towards a common goal to break down barriers to form
[01:34:13] and brought a sisterhood whatever you want to call it yeah that's that's that's what the team
[01:34:20] does and it's as you mentioned earlier it's not just what the team does every military unit when you
[01:34:26] go through boot camp in the navy okay maybe it's a different kind of hardship but there's a sleep
[01:34:33] deprivation there's a weird food scenario going on there's tasks that have to be done
[01:34:38] there's hammer sessions that take place like all those things they're unifying you and then you
[01:34:43] go to the next step and you get unified tighter and then you go to the next you go to budge you get unified
[01:34:47] tighter then you can show up in a sealed pitoon and now you're going through a hard work up and you're
[01:34:51] going to get unified even tighter and it's awesome do you um we rolled from there other I mean
[01:35:00] other aspects of work up was there anything that you were nervous about going through work up
[01:35:05] because you were and and I was going to say this earlier you know you said that you were a
[01:35:09] gray man going through buds meaning that you weren't great at anything but you weren't horrible
[01:35:12] anything and that was exactly the same way I was I wasn't great anything it wasn't horrible at
[01:35:16] anything I made it through in one shot because I wasn't I guess it wasn't as good as you but I
[01:35:23] because I failed I failed a little bit of everything but not enough of anything to get me rolled
[01:35:28] off so I've met a bit on the the the the Saturn or weaker side of the gray man but work up
[01:35:38] you you know as the as the guy that was running it the only people that kind of
[01:35:45] that showed up on my radar a lot where people that were having problems and you
[01:35:50] didn't show up on radar as having problems you were pretty much could do everything
[01:35:53] I mean what I appreciated about the teams was that it was a true meritocracy you got out of it
[01:36:03] what you put in and my original fears of being the menic of being boxed into just that
[01:36:09] responsibility because I wanted to do more I wanted to be the best asset I could be to my
[01:36:14] patreon to to my brothers and I quickly fell under the mentorship of many other people on the
[01:36:21] batoon Chris Cal was the primary sniper navigator point man and new guys kind of get
[01:36:29] matched up to a person he was the person I got matched up to because I would eventually be
[01:36:33] groomed to take on his responsibilities so early on I got tasked with being like the assistant lead
[01:36:41] now and point man and sniper which eventually got to take on these roles more a primary
[01:36:51] leader and workup and also on the point man so that meant that responsibility meant so much to me
[01:36:58] and I wanted to practice and train and wake up early and make sure just because I didn't want to
[01:37:05] mess it up not for myself but because I felt I owed and I did owe that responsibility
[01:37:15] of doing a good job to my patreon yeah I don't know that there's any greater people talk
[01:37:20] about motivation I don't know that there's any greater motivation is then I don't want to let my
[01:37:25] guys down and whether that's hey I don't look I know the entire patrol is following me as the
[01:37:32] point man or as the lead nav and if I mess this up I'm taking the whole patrol with me to be clear
[01:37:38] I messed up plenty of times I might in my pothole let me know about it I messed up plenty of times
[01:37:46] but still just trying that never ending pursuit to be better and to accept responsibility for your
[01:37:53] failures and promise you will do better that's what the workup is and you know we had a we had a
[01:38:00] great workup we went hard and in that workup and eventually we completed the workup we
[01:38:11] and we got ready we already go on deployment and you guys actually went on leave I don't know
[01:38:16] if you remember this we were going we were deploying to Baghdad that was the plan and we I had
[01:38:21] actually gone with a couple of the guys on pre-deployment site survey and checked out where we were
[01:38:26] going to be deploying to in Baghdad we were going to be doing you know basic direct action missions
[01:38:32] catching bad guys and pretty straightforward in that in that Baghdad area pretty straightforward
[01:38:40] deployment was what we were heading for and everyone went on leave and during that leave period
[01:38:47] I got called in and I actually don't even know if I took leave but I was at work and our boss
[01:38:54] our commanding officer you know called me in and said hey you guys aren't going to go to Baghdad anymore
[01:38:59] and actually he asked me like hey we're thinking about shifting things around how would you feel
[01:39:05] about going to Romani and I knew it was going on to Romani we don't well on if we all knew but I
[01:39:14] definitely knew it was going to Romani I knew how bad it was I knew it was the area where the most
[01:39:21] enemy was and where the most enemy contact was and where if we were going to fight that would be
[01:39:27] the place to go and you know what I talked to him and said yeah well we can make those adjustments
[01:39:32] and by the time you guys came back and off a leave we were we were then going to Romani
[01:39:39] yeah that decision making was that was not a were of that you know I was happy being just
[01:39:47] an E5 shooter and I do remember that yeah I can back and leave we're going to Romani
[01:39:53] place that I hadn't heard yeah I was going to say did you even know the difference were you
[01:39:57] just like whatever going to Iraq I'm happy yeah I mean I was 21 22 and I want to think about
[01:40:06] I was just a kid like what I know now based on what I knew back then it's just crazy
[01:40:12] yeah to me I don't think that was I don't think I was aware as aware I knew it was a bad place
[01:40:21] I don't think I was not to the same level as you of what was going on the the say gax going on
[01:40:27] at that time yeah I was I guess I was probably playing paying more attention
[01:40:35] to what was going on there and actually Romani had been really bad for a while
[01:40:41] for for a pretty good chunk of time but it wasn't like the seal task you know that was there
[01:40:49] was really getting after what they didn't look that extraordinary compared to any other
[01:40:57] tasking that that wasn't Iraq at the time so but I I knew it was going to be pretty
[01:41:05] gnarly going over there and and I also knew that if anyone would be able to do a good job there
[01:41:16] I knew that we could do a good job there as a tasking it because we had worked really hard
[01:41:22] we were firing on all cylinders as you said we were a we were an aggressive tasking it
[01:41:29] for sure and I knew it would be a good environment for us to go into and one of the things that
[01:41:38] we were getting ready to leave and the Commodore who's a fantastic guy ended up at Admiral and
[01:41:45] and he I had worked for him and I had a great relationship with him he's a fantastic guy but he
[01:41:50] came to debrief or to brief all of seal team three before he went on deployment and he said
[01:41:56] something along the lines of listen no one in this room is going to shoot their guns on this
[01:42:02] deployment or he said something maybe not quite that extremely something like chances are
[01:42:09] there's no one in this room that's going to shoot their guns on this deployment and you know this
[01:42:13] is just the things are a little less kinetic so we rolled over there and need this to say
[01:42:20] within the first I would say 24 hours at the whole that the whole tasking was there the
[01:42:26] base our little base got attacked and the entire task unit including some of the texts
[01:42:32] were up on the rooftop returning fire and a few days later that Commodore showed up and I you
[01:42:39] know I gave him a hard time I said hey sir you know you said no one was going to shoot their weapons
[01:42:43] and I said this entire task unit and most of the texts I've actually gave to the enemy at this time
[01:42:48] so that was a little welcome aboard I remember that night it was a good welcome and I remember
[01:42:53] some of the texts going through like six mags like the first couple minutes and like let's slow our
[01:42:59] roll down but yeah it was a good I think it became very clear the situation we found ourselves
[01:43:07] and and I agree I think we were as prepared as we could have been for that situation
[01:43:13] then what how long did it take you after being on the ground what was the first what was the
[01:43:20] first op you did it was the DA the the kind of one this is the one life and I joke about because
[01:43:26] the life was like life is like we're not going to be ready we're we should roll it we shouldn't do it
[01:43:32] and you know we've you know we've him and I've talked about this on the podcast I think which was
[01:43:38] I was like bro it's gonna be okay you got this and he was like he was nervous man because it was
[01:43:44] this is first op in Ramadi there's mayhem going on and you know I just I just looked at him
[01:43:51] and said bro you got this is not gonna be that hard and he was like Roger and you know he sucked it up
[01:43:57] and you guys went and executed the op no big deal you know no factor but it was surely
[01:44:04] thereafter that I started looking at a different strategy besides just doing DAs and moving
[01:44:10] more towards these overwatches and then we kind of started moving in that direction didn't take
[01:44:16] very long the brigade commander like almost out of the gate asked for our support in areas that
[01:44:25] were being heavily ID where we could go out and start introducing people that were putting in IDs
[01:44:31] what was that like for you from your perspective as a new guy what was your just tell people
[01:44:39] about your job what what that was like yeah so I early on in the deployment I was we had a lot of
[01:44:50] snipers you know and and the way the team's works and I'm sure you've said on previous podcasts
[01:44:56] everyone has multiple jobs we overlap responsibilities and so many ways we have you know half
[01:45:02] of the guys might be breachers so anyone can put an example in a slap and explosive on the door
[01:45:07] and and use the right one the appropriate one to get through to gain access to a building
[01:45:12] you know have you know a quarter of the guys our snipers so we cross we were able to fill in
[01:45:18] each other's roles and early on I was the assistant point man and navigator
[01:45:24] and one one of the snipers and of course the medic and at the time it was Chris leading a lot of
[01:45:33] those so it's learning from him how to as an navigator you're responsible for coming up with
[01:45:39] a ideal but safe route to your destination and you don't realize it at the time because you
[01:45:50] know you're just e4 e5 at the time just going through you think it's normal but that's so much
[01:45:55] responsibility to be able to come up with a plan on your own to review the cigarettes hey you know
[01:46:02] intersection I think it was two nine three two nine three which would have like double digit
[01:46:10] cigarettes a day and we're realizing hey what's probably go a different way or go through this
[01:46:17] alleyway and reviewing the satellite imagery to see and understanding and trying to go through
[01:46:25] do like a dirt dive which is just space was just planning the route in your head and seeing
[01:46:32] what kind of obstacles you might see or landmarks because GPS wasn't super reliable at the time
[01:46:39] especially since we had jammers you'll want on 24 seven so that people couldn't remotely
[01:46:44] detonate ideas we'd try and jam all all frequencies so a lot of times you didn't have GPS so
[01:46:50] you need to know the route cold and then as a point man being able to take to dismount safely
[01:46:59] and then guide your platoon to the target on foot and that also takes careful route
[01:47:06] planning careful route study and making sure you get the right target because I mean you can have
[01:47:13] pretty bad consequences when you hit the right hit the wrong target and of course your shooter just
[01:47:22] like everyone everyone's a shooter from the lowest and listed to the OIC is a shooter is responsible
[01:47:28] for their lanes for engaging the enemy for a turning fire for being a shooter and once you're on
[01:47:35] target if this is happens to be an overwatch we'd set up the night before and set up sniper
[01:47:42] overwatch positions so that we had good observations of different angles different lanes that the
[01:47:51] enemy might try and use to attack us or worse attack our brethren our army and marine corps
[01:48:01] brothers and sisters who might be doing a route clearance or might be doing a patrol
[01:48:06] and that's just like one flavor of the many different types of missions that we did
[01:48:10] you know we talked about DA direct action missions those were a little more direct you know you
[01:48:16] probably just drive up this and require as much I guess you know trying to be as seraptitious
[01:48:24] it's kind of going in loud you're not feeling anyone you're going loud aggressive hard
[01:48:29] and it's just a different flavor of a mission and those were just kind of an idea of the kinds of
[01:48:37] things that I did and a lot of our petrified mates did how do you like working with Chris
[01:48:44] I learned a lot from Chris it was you need to use a hard teacher but I learned a lot of
[01:48:53] important lessons from that and I feel like I I've been fortunate to have a lot of
[01:49:02] teachers and mentors role models along the way throughout life the life is certainly one
[01:49:10] high school teachers you know medical school at NASA my current job and just trying to take a
[01:49:17] little bit of what they teach you those pearls and incorporate into your own style to what works for you
[01:49:24] and certainly with Chris I had a lot of those pearls that I learned to help me become a better operator
[01:49:30] and a better leader now as you're doing these missions and you know it was there there was a lot of
[01:49:46] a lot of violence happening a lot of violence happening our army and Marine Corps brothers
[01:49:53] were getting wounded almost wounded or killed almost on a daily basis the amount of
[01:50:03] enemy attacks was basically almost 24 hours a day there were enemy attacks happening inside the city
[01:50:10] there were massive IDs that were just sickening you know you could hear them you to hear them
[01:50:17] on base go off or for your out and town you could hear them go off and you know that when they went off
[01:50:23] there was there was wounded and mutilated and maimed and killed Americans I mean every single
[01:50:28] time you'd hear one of those it would you make me cringe as you continued to roll out
[01:50:40] you know day after day what was your what was your mindset you know I've talked to
[01:50:45] a lot of combat vets and and right down to one of the guys that I had on named Dean Lad
[01:50:53] who was the Marine in World War II who was gut shot walking to the beach in Tahrua this is
[01:51:01] after he did Ewo I mean just a or Guadalcanal and you know I was talking to him about it he's like
[01:51:06] I never thought it would happen to me that was kind of what cleared his mind but those guys
[01:51:16] I mean it's a different type of combat where look you're they're gonna do this this assault
[01:51:22] and it's gonna last two three four days before they get to kind of settle in they had less time to
[01:51:28] think about it without a doubt they had less time to think about it they weren't coming back to
[01:51:32] a base like we were where you're relatively safe and then you got to reload and go back again
[01:51:40] how did that play outside 21 year old Johnny Kim's mind yeah and I don't think I've ever been asked
[01:51:48] not that it's a pretty insightful question and I don't think I've asked other people
[01:51:54] what mental calculus what things they needed to go through to prepare themselves for these
[01:52:05] for these challenges I know what I did and what worked for me and I don't doubt I don't know
[01:52:12] if it works for other people or if that's what other people did but I mean I don't I have no
[01:52:18] qualms saying but when I showed up to Iraq I was scared I mean my first deployment and on your
[01:52:27] first deployment to a war zone I don't know if other people but I was in the frame like oh
[01:52:32] as soon as I step off this bird into country I'm gonna get shot at which is not at all the case
[01:52:38] right um there's varying levels of intensity in the war right I mean there were some
[01:52:45] bases where you had Taco Bell and pizza Hut right and then you had like the sticks where
[01:52:52] Marines were rough in it and sleeping in holes and they ground um that look like graves and so
[01:52:59] they were I think varying experiences and you know for me I quickly learned my first big firefight
[01:53:12] um was I'm sure you remember this but it was an unfortunate blue on blue or blue one green
[01:53:24] incident and that was a big wakeup call to me and I'm sure we could talk a length about that
[01:53:32] a lot of lessons learned from it but I quickly learned that the mental
[01:53:37] preparation I needed to do for myself was to assume I was going to die that I was already dead
[01:53:49] and I was there to fulfill my role in the pituit as a shooter and that was liberating for me
[01:53:59] it was hard to get in that frame of mind but once you got in that frame of mind
[01:54:03] for me it was easier to stay in that frame of mind kind of like how when I was cold and
[01:54:10] buds I wanted to stay cold so there were guys who would take a warm shower if you had the
[01:54:14] opportunity to but for me I wanted to stay uncomfortable because being comfortable being uncomfortable
[01:54:23] is an important trait and once I was able to reconcile that I wasn't going to come home that I was
[01:54:33] going to die it freed me to be able to do my job without the human emotion that can be very
[01:54:42] disabling of which is fear and I think it made me more clear of mind and focused and I think it
[01:54:55] made me a better operator but I don't know if that works for everyone and I don't think that is also
[01:55:02] a very healthy way healthy state of mind to stay in for long periods of time I think you need to learn
[01:55:08] how to decompress and learn how to switch things on and off and have space in your brain
[01:55:17] compartmentalized spaces where you can put very bad emotions or very disabling emotions away
[01:55:24] so that you can do your job at hand that's what seemed to work for me
[01:55:31] yeah I think that's a common add to that know that as 100% what my add to it was was okay you know this
[01:55:39] is what I'm going to do and I'm going to keep doing it and there's a chance I'm going to die and
[01:55:47] that's the way it is and if it happens then that happens but I think what makes it feel
[01:55:54] liberating slash good is that any concern let's face it you can do everything right you can
[01:56:04] plan the perfect route you can manipulate your weapon perfectly you can maneuver through the
[01:56:09] streets perfectly you can still get killed whether you can get shot whether you get blown up like
[01:56:13] it can happen and if if if you're worried about things that you can control that you're wasting
[01:56:18] energy and you're not providing the correct support to the rest of your guys because you're
[01:56:22] freaked out about what's going to happen to you and that's why I think that's pretty common actually
[01:56:29] is okay look here's the risk and now I'm going to put that in a box over here I'm not going
[01:56:34] to worry about it anymore because it doesn't do me or my team any good now this is where I think the
[01:56:43] well from a leadership perspective and then from a medic slash corpsman perspective
[01:56:48] the most absolute anxiety that I had the sick twisting gut that I would have
[01:56:56] wouldn't be at all from me getting blown up or me getting shot or me getting killed or anything
[01:57:00] happened to me it was a hundred percent because of you guys and and it was impossible to not
[01:57:12] it was impossible for me to not think that if you guys were rolling out or not or Delta was
[01:57:19] rolling out or opera whoever was rolling out that there was a chance look if it's not happening tonight
[01:57:28] it's going to happen tomorrow if it doesn't happen tomorrow and I deal happen in two weeks I know
[01:57:32] one of these nights the call is going to come on the radio and I know what the call is going to be
[01:57:38] I know what the call is going to be and there's it was like and again I don't want to sound fatalistic
[01:57:43] about this because I didn't think about it in a way I didn't think about it like hey throw
[01:57:49] caution when this is going to happen anyways it wasn't like that at all it was like reality
[01:57:56] the reality was you know the reality was I'm talking to the brigade commander every day I'm
[01:58:04] talking to the Italian commanders every day I know what to go on out there in some cases I'm
[01:58:10] tracking it you know by the hour and so that in my gut was the hardest was the most was the hardest
[01:58:21] thing that I had to deal with was just man just being worried about you guys that was it
[01:58:28] and I can only imagine for you as a medic same thing like you know hey you can't trade
[01:58:39] bullets with bad guys every single day you can't walk down these streets every single day
[01:58:47] and get away with it for the whole time it's just not very likely the only thing stronger than
[01:58:55] fear for self for us was fear of letting your petunate down or fear of getting your friends killed
[01:59:06] that to me is the greatest fear of all and I agree with you when if you accept that
[01:59:17] you may die you may not come home your friends may not come home it's not being complacent about it
[01:59:27] it's not being okay well I thought of my hands I'm not no you're gonna do your best you will not
[01:59:34] get complacent you will remain hard to kill you will be effective in your job but you understand
[01:59:42] the risks of the work you have ahead of you and you you accept those risks so you are free to be
[01:59:54] effective in your job so I would say that everybody I would say that we all kind of knew that the
[02:00:23] day would come and like you said I mean it wasn't a wasn't fatalistic it wasn't complacency
[02:00:36] it was the realistic assessment of where we were at and I think everybody knew that the day
[02:00:45] would come and maybe if someone says they didn't it's only because they were you know able to
[02:00:51] convince themselves that to you know to keep a positive attitude and the day did come
[02:01:05] and we'd had a couple guys get wounded you know Cowley was wounded bad
[02:01:12] a lot of clothes calls innumerable countless clothes calls which in a way kind of make you feel like
[02:01:25] maybe we can pull this off but in the end it's it's it's it's war
[02:01:34] so
[02:01:46] what did that duty you August 2 2006
[02:01:50] hard to articulate in words what that day did I talked a little bit in the
[02:02:12] beginning of how my father has shaped my actions to become the seal well I'd say the events that unfolded
[02:02:20] on August 2 2006 and days afterwards where we lost much better warriors than I much
[02:02:31] braver and selfless that the hoses were much more formative in shaping what I do and will do for the rest of my life
[02:02:47] you know we lost the actions of that day we lost two really good man
[02:02:51] um I don't even know where to start you know one of my good friends one of our good
[02:03:08] friends Ryan Joe was hitting the face God I learned a lot that day
[02:03:14] I think we all I think we all did and a piece of us stayed there that day died with us you know Ryan was
[02:03:29] was hitting the face um yeah and I remember going single cracks are usually not good
[02:03:46] the crack you know in the crack when I say crack I mean um when you were on the giving end of a rifle
[02:03:54] you it's a much different sound than being on the receiving end of a rifle that of a bullet that's
[02:03:59] supersonic it makes a very distinctive crack and when you hear that and it's single one it
[02:04:08] generally is not good and I remember that radio call coming out from life saying that Ryan had been hit
[02:04:16] and that I was needed um whatever going to the roof and seeing Ryan lying down and a pull of his
[02:04:26] blood and uh there's these images in my head that just have so much human compassion
[02:04:35] in a crazy chaotic time and I remember life in Chris at a side and life as holding his hat
[02:04:44] holding his hand and just saying just hang on brother we just hang on me up
[02:04:51] and uh I did the best I could to stabilize Ryan but Ryan just Ryan's a trooper I mean he's he was the
[02:04:58] best of us um even then not concerned about his own welfare I'm making sure that we were safe we were
[02:05:05] being safe and staying low um and we had Mark was there laying down some good covering fire to
[02:05:15] get Ryan out of that position and I like um we called on our brothers from the army um to
[02:05:28] bring us the armor we needed to get out of there and I'm very grateful for that
[02:05:33] uh so I accompanied Ryan out of there and there's not much you can do as a medic in that
[02:05:42] situation I'm not keeping Ryan alive I'm keeping his airway open stop in the bleeding and that's
[02:05:48] it he's keeping himself alive and the definitive care he needed was a surgeon he needed to get
[02:05:54] to an operating table stat and we talked about things learned from that day failures I had one of
[02:06:05] my biggest failures from that day and it pains me to this day because Ryan didn't see it that way
[02:06:14] we stopped off at one of the aid stations I think at Cop Falcon a lot on the way
[02:06:20] which just a paint this room it was a concrete 20 feet by 20 feet room with no electricity no
[02:06:29] running water definitely not a place to get definitive care and it was being manned by you know
[02:06:40] for army physicians assistant um who I think had the best of intentions but had other
[02:06:53] clouding human emotions that resulted in poor judgment one being ego just perhaps the biggest
[02:07:05] poison of all and anything we do and just to give you an idea of this I mean it was a war zone
[02:07:14] down there I mean just a few days prior to that we had been moored in that area and a few army soldiers
[02:07:21] were hit by this mortar bad and we were pretty close in our in Cop Falcon and I went over to try and
[02:07:31] help and some of these guys were pretty hypervillemic which is a word for saying they were low on
[02:07:38] blood volume because they were losing it and I was trying to get IV access on one of these guys and I
[02:07:44] had a hard time doing it eventually was able to get a jug sticking in the neck but this the guy who
[02:07:54] was manning at the so-for was you know just giving me a hard time about it which it's fine I think we
[02:08:03] give each other a hard time we make fun of each other but I think I mean I took it hard myself because
[02:08:08] I like me and I really wanted to help these guys and I was failing and giving getting this line in
[02:08:13] and I be lying in and I was naive and just just I think insecure I was professionally embarrassed
[02:08:25] that I could not get this line in and so I know it was a little intimidated by this guy so I had
[02:08:31] that painting of this situation with this relationship with this person and coming in I knew that
[02:08:37] coming into this aid station at Cop Falcon was only gonna hurt Ryan and I was yelling at the army
[02:08:42] guys and I mean you want to you know E2 drivers we're just doing what they were told I'm like we need to go
[02:08:48] to camp her body right now to get to an OR and they were telling me we need to stop by this aid we
[02:08:55] have orders to stop off of this aid station and Ryan's on this cot and I mean there's no way to get
[02:09:04] definitive care you can't even be sterile in this area I mean this is a concrete room with
[02:09:09] no electricity and he was trying to give a nasal fair out an MPA nasal fair and geol airway
[02:09:16] to Ryan which is a little remember the trumpet nose you put in you know keeps an airway secure
[02:09:23] but you never ever give an MPA to folks listening to this who have any kind of medical background
[02:09:31] you would never give an MPA to someone with suspected facial with suspected mapsilare fractures which is
[02:09:37] what Ryan certainly had had to be shot through the left cheek right around around the left orbit
[02:09:46] and I was top of my lungs arguing with this guy this is not what he needed like you should not do
[02:09:54] that we needed to get to camp her body and there was a certain power differential right I mean
[02:10:00] I was E5 21 22 old kid and I had this O4 who was telling me how things should be done and Ryan's there
[02:10:11] hearing all this and I like a lot of army regulations I'm not trying to
[02:10:22] give any disrespect to the army but the two drivers who drove me there were like you need
[02:10:30] to clear and save your weapon and you know if you remember there's always a barrel outside of
[02:10:35] every building of the clearance safe it I understand because there's a lot of accidents and all
[02:10:39] this charge that happened in the military but for teen guys I think that's like clearing your
[02:10:45] having to point your weapon in a barrel the clearance safe it is not really you don't need to
[02:10:49] do that we just clearance safe in the safe direction right just be responsible have
[02:10:53] accountability for muscle awareness and what you're doing is like and I was trying to fight this
[02:10:59] fight with this with this PA and the other army soldiers were trying to like you need to
[02:11:05] you need to go inside right now and clear the weapon so frustrated I left clear my weapon to came back
[02:11:10] and PA hit and turned the PA's right and Ryan was coughing up blood and bad and I saw the look
[02:11:20] on this PA's face that he I think he recognized that this was outside his scope of abilities
[02:11:30] and that he was in over his head and may have hurt Ryan and from there my request to get to
[02:11:39] camp Ramon he was immediately fulfilled and we got back in the load Ryan and got Ryan to
[02:11:45] camp Ramon to the appropriate level of care to awaiting surgeons doctors to take care of Ryan
[02:11:53] but to me that's one of my biggest failures because I let Ryan down and what PA
[02:12:01] intemies that in the years afterwards he always thanked me that I stood up for him and Ryan I
[02:12:10] I don't know why you're thanking me I failed you I could have done something more I could have
[02:12:21] could have stood up for my friend a little bit more I could have
[02:12:24] I don't know what I could have done but I could have done something he Ryan deserved better
[02:12:34] and who knows what this did I mean Ryan was blind as you know afterwards but he says I was the last
[02:12:42] person he saw he wishes I was a little prettier Ryan lightly became blind secondary to infections
[02:12:53] swelling trauma but maybe that was the final straw that made him blind and eventually led to him
[02:13:05] getting all those surgeries which eventually took his life as you know he had multiple surgeries
[02:13:09] and one of his surgeries he was unfortunately taken from us I don't know but I made a promise
[02:13:19] after that that regardless of my rank of where I stood or of what kind of power differential I was
[02:13:25] if I saw something wrong like that and I knew someone would get hurt that I would stand up and
[02:13:32] speak and not let something like that ever happen again we see things happen all the time that we
[02:13:46] know aren't right you know a lot you sometimes you just know deep down that that's not right and you
[02:13:51] choose your battles I think it's important to choose what battles you stand up more
[02:13:56] whether there are some battles that you should never ever stand down and I swore I would never make
[02:14:02] that mistake again and then find a very relevant today I mean we accept the risks of our occupation
[02:14:12] for the greater good of what it does for society our country our species and it's relevant in
[02:14:23] space exploration in NASA what I've been honored and privileged to take part of and we accept
[02:14:30] the risks of what we are trying to do for the general good what it brings back to humanity
[02:14:37] but I think having that experience to know it's worth cashing in that currency that reputation
[02:14:47] you've built up to speak up one something is up one something is messed up
[02:14:53] to one of the I feel like we could talk about that day for the rest of the I think we could
[02:15:00] talk about August thinking for the rest of the day but all the other things and that's just the first
[02:15:07] chapter of what happened that day as you know we lost markedly on that day those
[02:15:21] lot of what I do today I made a promise to not just those to not just to mark and Ryan but
[02:15:28] I can I can list along listen names of people we've lost since then that we that the void
[02:15:38] created by those warriors that would certainly have done good for this world that I owe it that we
[02:15:48] owe it to them to be a positive mark in this world and that can take many forms for me
[02:15:56] that was why I wanted to be a physician it didn't really matter that it was medicine and it
[02:16:02] was just natural for me because that's what I was involved in to take that level of service to a
[02:16:08] higher calling but taking like trying to become an astronaut is completely consistent with my promise
[02:16:17] to leave the positive impact in this world and that's how I honor the brothers we lost and I
[02:16:31] will never stop until the day I die trying to fill in that void because it's a boy that can never be
[02:16:37] filled in.
[02:16:47] I was walking out of the tactical operations center on a little base on that day and
[02:17:11] I remember I I walked out and I looked over to my right and walked out the door and I looked over to my
[02:17:26] right and I saw you and you were on your knees you were fairly covered in blood
[02:17:52] and you were washing the blood washing the blood out of Ryan's helmet and
[02:18:22] I realized that this was going to take a very personal toll on everybody and
[02:18:52] I didn't know what to say there was no training no one had been killed and I rack before
[02:19:13] for seals we never talked about we never talked about we talked about hey if a guy gets wounded
[02:19:26] if a guy gets killed here's what we're going to do in the next six minutes here's how we're
[02:19:30] going to get a guy extracted here's the cash the evacuation here's the protocol that we're going to go
[02:19:34] through here's the medical procedure going to do to try and save his life these are all things we're
[02:19:38] going to do in the 15 minutes from when someone gets hurt and I had been in the seal teams for
[02:19:51] 16 years at that point 15 years and not one time ever in any training scenario did we ever talk
[02:20:09] about okay now what do we do now there's a little protocol around hey here's the casualty
[02:20:18] the casualty officer that's going to go here's the protocol that we follow for notification
[02:20:24] the family all that stuff all the mechanics of it existed and we we did what we were supposed to
[02:20:31] we followed that protocol but the protocol for how do I look at a 21 year old kid that's cleaning
[02:20:38] the blood out of one of his friends helmets there's no protocol for that and what I mean what I
[02:20:53] had to do was because I was still for guy in charge and I had to try and figure out what to do
[02:21:05] there was no one ask no an ask there's no there's no person to say hey what do I do now
[02:21:17] and you know what what I defaulted to which I actually told you guys in the clear
[02:21:27] three days later two days later when I finally could assemble a sentence was go back to work
[02:21:38] was that this is what we came to do we still have a mission we still have soldiers and
[02:21:44] Marines that are out there risking their lives that we absolutely provide safety and security
[02:21:49] for we can deliver those guys home to their families and that's that's what we need to do
[02:22:04] and that's you know that's what we did
[02:22:05] you know sometimes words there are no right words for situations like that but I think
[02:22:27] just being there with the people you love at your side is the most important thing
[02:22:37] to be doing to go back out and work and do the job you came there to do that you signed up to do
[02:22:45] and it's not for I don't mean to be disrespectful with with these words but it's not for
[02:23:01] country or service it's for the person sitting next to you for standing next to you for your
[02:23:06] brother and your sister you do it because you love that person because at least to me and in my
[02:23:14] experience the folks who joined to be seals who did it because they wanted to serve their
[02:23:20] country that was the greatest reason they were there there wasn't a bigger intrinsic reason
[02:23:28] like doing it for the person next to you for the brotherhood for yourself they didn't seem to
[02:23:36] make it through and I'm not sure if I would die for my country but I would and I will die
[02:23:51] for my brother and sister without a doubt and that's just a taste of war we lost two people
[02:24:11] that day there are put tunes companies who have lost half most of their unit you think of you see
[02:24:21] the numbers from World War two or from Vietnam it's astounding we I'm and I am not trying to be
[02:24:30] little the sacrifices our service members have done in this war but I'm just trying to put it in
[02:24:37] context that we had a whole generation of people we asked them to continue fighting despite
[02:24:48] the heavy losses and casualties they suffered on a daily basis that trumped any number we had
[02:24:56] in the post 9-11 wars and they did it
[02:25:03] so being there with your brothers and sisters and continuing that fight that is the best
[02:25:14] remedy for a situation like that
[02:25:18] and obviously the other you know it's real obvious I guess when you look back but
[02:25:42] again this is something that a lot of times we weren't prepared for in the modern seal
[02:25:50] teams you know when I when I was raising the seal teams in the 90s we were preparing for one
[02:25:57] mission if we were lucky we'd do one mission and that mindset kind of got into our heads where
[02:26:04] you're you know you just didn't think about how how you would continue on and yet I mean we stood
[02:26:09] down for like two days and then it was like okay get your gear back on and it's time to go
[02:26:19] even in that same day after Ryan which hit we said get your stuff on get your gear back on
[02:26:28] reload get back out there and I mean it it it pains me to this a day that I wasn't there
[02:26:42] for that assault because I was with Ryan and I am glad that I was by Ryan's side
[02:26:48] but I meant I wasn't there from Mark when he was shot and killed the next time I saw him
[02:27:04] was in the morgue giving hit giving a final kiss to his forehead
[02:27:09] I didn't mean to interrupt well yeah you're exactly right and and so Ryan wounded and
[02:27:23] I mean severely wounded and then yeah you're right it wasn't even a day it was a matter of
[02:27:34] an hour maybe before life called me up and said hey this is what's going on
[02:27:43] and then yeah once Mark was gone then it was a couple days and then okay
[02:27:54] and again the the the the strange thing or
[02:27:59] I guess the thing to contemplate a little bit deeper is you know if you're going on to
[02:28:07] gobble canal like you're gonna fight and you're not gonna have time to think about what just happened
[02:28:14] whereas hey the way it was for us it was like okay well now you're gonna stand down for two days
[02:28:20] you're gonna think about everything you're gonna you're gonna package up your your bro's gear and send it home
[02:28:30] you're gonna you're gonna be thinking about that and then you're gonna get in the same vehicles
[02:28:37] you're gonna roll out and
[02:28:40] and that's what lies you said that's what you do for your brothers that's what you do
[02:28:54] you keep doing your job you know I was thinking about that too when you're talking about shooting
[02:29:01] and you're talking about look you you know you do you know how you get through that part of the course
[02:29:05] you fall the procedures you do your job you check your body position you front side focus how do you complete the
[02:29:11] stocks you you figure out with the dead spaces you follow the protocol that's what you do that's that's
[02:29:17] what you do that's how you move forward you do what you're supposed to do
[02:29:20] and of course it was an over either because because then you know in September we'll ask
[02:29:41] Mike as well so close to being home going home and a million different excuses that you could make
[02:30:02] to not go out and do your job
[02:30:20] and it was a heavy obviously coming home from that deployment
[02:30:24] was I mean first of all there was no you know they do the they do the decompression stops now
[02:30:37] where you stop somewhere and you hang out for a few days and you kind of decompress what we
[02:30:42] didn't do that we got on a plane and we woke you know flew home and woke up and we were back in San Diego
[02:30:55] yeah right we didn't have time to decompress we didn't have the long boat ride over
[02:31:02] the Atlantic to decompress with your buddies around cards around a drink and just talk that's
[02:31:15] what you do right after an op you just hang out with your but with your bros and just you don't
[02:31:23] know your decompressing but that's what you're doing and to be thrust back into civilization normal
[02:31:31] modern civilization that is a hard transition and it is surreal and it can mess people up
[02:31:40] when did you come home do you remember yeah so I came home in October most folks came home
[02:31:47] early October or late September I came home because I was I was reading listening and if you
[02:31:56] remember the rules to read and list you need to be it protects the purposes you need to be in
[02:32:03] country on the first day of the month right so I stayed in extra two or three weeks more after
[02:32:09] the rest of my but tune and gone home yeah that's funny remember I ever wanted to like just
[02:32:17] get a special one all your bros already home just wanted to get home they told you it was still there
[02:32:22] with me yeah Tony was still they were we were rough together and I think we still got another
[02:32:27] opportunity out of it with I think team five yeah had had was coming to really us yeah you
[02:32:35] well you were the last plane home with us I was I think on one of the last planes home
[02:32:42] because I remember um I remember meeting Marcus as he was in the battalion we're leaving us
[02:32:49] and yeah I think I was in the I think in one of the last planes home and then at this point
[02:33:01] it was weird when we got home because like the guys back on the strand had been like reading
[02:33:06] our after actions reports known what we were doing they gone to our guys funerals
[02:33:13] visit our wounded guys in the hospital and I remember when we got home
[02:33:17] this was the decompression plan they had new guys swim pairs of new guys so if for instance
[02:33:32] when we went to the bar they had a they had a new guy to drive you home and a new guy to drive
[02:33:39] your car home that was the decompression plan I remember thinking myself well okay at least
[02:33:49] somebody thought of something and that's what that's what it was it was all right you know we'll
[02:33:54] take care of you guys we know you got some steam to blow off and that's what we did I don't know if
[02:33:59] that was a good plan it doesn't really see back I think the spirit of trying to do the spirit of
[02:34:06] it was good execution was maybe a little yeah just maybe there's something we could have used more
[02:34:12] than a new guy to drive you I remember I was getting in a car and I mean we're look
[02:34:23] there's when you when when when I'll just speak for my own person when I came home from that
[02:34:27] appointed like you you weren't holding a lot back you know it was like no you're dumb no don't do
[02:34:35] that hey we're not doing that it was like we were I was definitely at that point of just calling things
[02:34:42] how they were and that was like you had to I had to re-adapt to say okay you know what I can't just
[02:34:51] just just do that all the time absolutely I I feel like we can talk a long time about
[02:35:01] re-aclimating back to society and how to do that effectively and I think personally that
[02:35:07] that transition is so difficult that it is also the reason why a lot of people have trouble
[02:35:15] read justing back to society because you put that switch on for so long you just don't know
[02:35:21] exactly how to turn it back off and I remember very clearly when I came back it was very raw
[02:35:29] everything was raw and I was a lot more direct and I think the heat and anger my heart had
[02:35:41] just swelled up and I it it took me years to read just re-aclimate get a better understanding of
[02:35:54] what I had been through and what I was feeling to be a productive member of society because
[02:36:01] you can't talk that way you maybe you'll get away talking like that to a patoon of seals
[02:36:07] for the rest of your career but you're going to be very you're in for a surprise for a shock when
[02:36:14] you go back to the real world and you realize that people don't respond in that fashion when you
[02:36:20] talk to them because I mean that's just not how most of society most of humans interact they don't
[02:36:27] interact on that type of level of intensity and rawness so that was huge huge learning for me
[02:36:37] and I'm very thankful that I had the years that in going to college are working in a different
[02:36:46] line of work to really understand that a different human side a different meaning of what I meant to be
[02:36:52] human I was I remember I had conversations with life and death because life and death
[02:37:02] the two-partue commanders you know we were getting asked questions we were getting the people that we're saying
[02:37:07] well should you guys been going on the day or should you guys been working with like we were getting
[02:37:11] all those questions and I had a legitimate sit down with both those guys and I was like listen
[02:37:19] we cannot be emotional about this we cannot respond it came after we went to a meeting
[02:37:24] where it was an officer detailer meeting and we were you know it's sort of plotting out what the
[02:37:30] what an officer career should look like blah blah blah and somehow this so the three of us are
[02:37:35] in the bunch of other officers like all lieutenant's all you know lieutenant's maybe some oh
[02:37:40] force in there and one of the other guys that I knew who's a good guy he he didn't mean anything
[02:37:46] by it but but he said something along the lines of you know when we were saying well it'd be
[02:37:53] good to do this job or that job or whatever and the conversation was going and he said something
[02:37:58] along the lines of well not everyone's going to be as lucky as you guys were because I think you
[02:38:03] know he was just trying to say be good for guys to be able to get another shit and he goes not
[02:38:06] everyone's going to be as lucky as you guys were then and I get what he was saying but like I had to
[02:38:14] I had to you know just detach a little bit because let's face it I mean this was within weeks of
[02:38:20] coming home and you're thinking the last thing in the world you think you are lucky that you just
[02:38:25] buried your freaking guys and and I but you know we all maintained but you know after that I
[02:38:34] I talked to Nathan Seth who as you know Nathan Seth are not exactly the most you know they're
[02:38:41] not real great at hiding their emotions right they're both freaking passionate emotional guys
[02:38:46] and I was like guys we cannot you if we talk about this deployment from emotional perspective all the
[02:38:53] time we're we're not going to be able to communicate properly what we learned and so we have to
[02:39:00] take a step back don't get emotional don't get an arguments about this stuff just stay detached
[02:39:06] and and communicate what happened human psychology is everything learning how to be in control of
[02:39:18] your emotions your body language how you craft your words it's probably the most important thing
[02:39:26] you can do as a leader and as a follower and it took me many years to learn this and I'm just kind of
[02:39:36] smiling as you're talking about this I did not learn as a 22 year old kid coming back from the
[02:39:43] deployment I did not learn how to detach myself how to be emotionless because while human emotion
[02:39:52] is what makes us human and is some of the best aspects of what make us human it is all also the
[02:39:59] biggest hindrance to getting stuff done to completing the mission ego is a part of it narcissism
[02:40:05] is a part of it those are human emotions but they're walls and when you bring emotion to the table
[02:40:13] you are mounting defenses that make it hard to get to the core of your argument of what your
[02:40:19] vision is and I've got countless stories where I failed and then endeavor but have learned
[02:40:28] through experience and through just watching other people observing making mistakes
[02:40:34] being in the seal teams of learning to find tune that emotional and social intelligence
[02:40:42] to know the human psychology of the person you're talking to of how to disarm their defenses
[02:40:50] if they are emotional or disagree with you because people have common I friendly believe that
[02:41:00] all people want good things we just disagree on how to get from point A to point B and that's where
[02:41:06] we mount our defenses and lose sight of the big picture but if you can take a step back
[02:41:12] remove your ego and emotion from the picture and find common ground that's where you can
[02:41:20] influence and share your vision to complete your objective and that's that's applicable in
[02:41:27] everything we do let's applicable in combat to political and pool in business in medicine
[02:41:33] in what I do as a national and NASA is trying to share that vision trying to get that buy in
[02:41:41] and then all starts with understanding the human condition
[02:41:46] I've got a funny story that I always remember
[02:41:49] and I'm embarrassed about it and I wish if I ever meet this person again I would like to say
[02:41:59] I would like to apologize there are a lot of people I would like to apologize and this is one of them
[02:42:04] I was home this is at post deployment and I was playing one of the many call of duty video games
[02:42:10] and this is my brother's girlfriend and she saw me playing this video game and I'm just
[02:42:15] getting into it and she says I don't understand war such a waste of life
[02:42:21] and there was something inside of me that just I'm embarrassed to say but I snapped
[02:42:32] and I had I was stern I wasn't like I wasn't unprofessional on cussing her out but I was like
[02:42:42] that like you don't know what you're talking about how dare you say like I think having a pretty
[02:42:52] not a responsible way of responding back to that it was born out of emotion because
[02:42:58] I was hurt because I took that as an attack against friends that I had just recently lost
[02:43:04] and this young woman who had no maliciousness behind her comment and was absolutely surprised
[02:43:15] with my reaction and was apologetic but I could have been more effective just slowing down
[02:43:25] removing actually using the intrinsic emotion I was having as a as a tell
[02:43:31] right because if you can be a little more control and understanding of your own emotions it can tell
[02:43:38] you it can give you hints as to what is going on and how to properly respond and craft your
[02:43:45] words to get your message across I could have with my body language with my tone I could have
[02:43:55] said something different to to let her know how I understand the spirit of her comment but how that
[02:44:02] comes across to veterans and how she can be better informed of the future to be more careful
[02:44:08] with her words and not have snapped back at her and to this day I told my brother and he's like
[02:44:14] no it's not a big deal at all she's like she never you know she probably wouldn't even remember
[02:44:19] it but I still to this day feel bad and that's just one of many examples where I let human
[02:44:26] emotion get in the way and I can for me my childhood was a phase of learning the teams were
[02:44:35] a phase of learning but post teams there was a lot of learning how to be a human that made
[02:44:42] me suitable to be a candidate for our space exploration program and I there's no way I would
[02:44:52] be in the situation have the honor and privilege I do now if it wasn't for all of those experiences
[02:45:00] you get home from that deployment and this again it's the same the same idea is guess what
[02:45:06] you're going to do now you're going to go another tune you're going to get do another work
[02:45:10] up you're going to pull him in again was there you just that's just how and you're just going to
[02:45:15] execute that yeah I think it's a bit different this time ago around I think I already said it earlier
[02:45:28] but there's a special name for what up for seals like me because I only did two tours to deploy
[02:45:36] minutes which for people who don't know in the grand scheme of things it's nothing compared to the
[02:45:41] experience of a lot of seals a lot of soldiers marines who have done multiple tours and but the first
[02:45:48] one we had agreed we had a lot of heavy sustained combat experience and being able to do to take
[02:45:56] those experiences forward this time not as a new guy having new seals and our pertune and being able
[02:46:03] to mentor them was a privilege and an honor so it was I remember feeling drastically different
[02:46:15] the second time through and still of course learning every single day but also knowing that you
[02:46:20] serve as a role model and everything you do and say and act to believe it or not younger people because
[02:46:28] I've all those pretty young but even more junior and younger seals and the second puttune
[02:46:38] work up going through that again and deploying again and while the second time around it was a
[02:46:45] little different there was this there was a stint under Seth where we had some pretty sustained combat
[02:46:54] yeah well the funny thing was when Seth was considering what he was going to do next and
[02:47:04] you know he was going to go to school maybe get out always all these different options that he had in
[02:47:09] his head and you know I talked to him and I was like hey man first of all if you don't if you don't
[02:47:17] take over the Sask unit someone else is and the only person that you take it over should be someone
[02:47:22] experienced someone that will take care of these guys that deserve to have someone to take care of them
[02:47:29] and you know he's listening to me and finally just stands up and starts walking down and I'm like
[02:47:34] where are you going he's like I'm going to talk to the excel and I was like go to get a tell him I said
[02:47:37] I'm going to tell him I'm taking over this task unit and I was like Roger that but one of the other
[02:47:43] things now as you guys were going through work up and you know there's all kinds of this this the
[02:47:50] there's all the political things going on there's all the little backstabbing and all this
[02:47:55] crops you know just normal kind of political crap that goes on and you don't want it to go on
[02:48:01] to the teams but it does and so that stuff's going on and Seth you know Seth's he was real prone
[02:48:10] to getting frustrated by that stuff you know he could freak out about something and so finally you know
[02:48:15] what one day he's out this all the capability they're doing and whatever and I said bro just calm
[02:48:22] down going to employment nothing's going on go over there work out for six months you know get
[02:48:26] strong and then come home and then chill out you know go to sure duty whatever so he's like
[02:48:33] fine you know and so he goes on to point it just like you all did with the attitude of like okay
[02:48:38] cool you know nothing's going on we're going to go to a place with a good gym will train some
[02:48:44] Iraqi soldiers and we will you know get big and then sure enough as fate would have it you guys roll in
[02:48:52] and pretty quickly after you guys roll in the I don't know if you know this side of the story
[02:48:59] but the conventional some of the conventional commanders that were there when task unit bruiser was there
[02:49:04] found out that some of the guys from task unit bruiser were back in country and put out a very
[02:49:10] specific request for forces that spelled out exactly who they wanted and that's that's why
[02:49:19] you guys ended up getting the call for supporting the efforts inside of solder city which was
[02:49:28] a freaking disaster at the time yeah it was none of where of that it was um and we found ourselves in
[02:49:36] an in a situation where we had the opportunity the privilege to have an impact on operations and
[02:49:48] support our brothers and sisters in the army and I remember also Mike Sureli being there and
[02:49:56] I went to Buds with Mike and it was an honor to serve under his leadership I admired Mike
[02:50:06] long ago from Buds being an 18 year old kid and obviously you know Mike he was a former roper
[02:50:15] former for um Marine Force Recon staff sergeant so you know we in Buds we were enamored with his
[02:50:26] experience but also his ability to talk respectfully and speak the language to the other officers and
[02:50:36] the instructors but also speak to the level of the lowest in listed and that's a skill that's hard
[02:50:44] to learn and definitely I was unaware at the time but also making observations and taking
[02:50:50] unconscious notes to incorporate in my own quest to learn how to share my vision and how to be
[02:51:03] a follower and how to be a leader later on in my life what do you remember about um that first
[02:51:11] op into solder city was good times huh yeah I would I would I would make a disc
[02:51:21] plant so I served as one of the appointment and the navigators and I had to confess that I did not
[02:51:29] have a good I did not perform well especially on that first op and it was you know I'd take
[02:51:42] accountability for that and it's not that I ever had to talk with Seth or anything but I don't
[02:51:48] I've never actually had this conversation with anyone but I know that first op I felt like I failed
[02:51:53] in a lot of ways this is the first time I'm actually publicly talking about it
[02:51:56] it was a new area we had made this force combined from operators from different
[02:52:07] platoons and different teams we and there were never worked together and in theory you should
[02:52:12] be that shouldn't be a problem right because we had the same standard operating procedures everyone
[02:52:16] knows how to do an I had an appeal left peel rights center peel you know respond moving
[02:52:22] cover and move everyone knows the basics but they did throw a little bit of a wrench just
[02:52:29] working with operators you hadn't yet worked with and I know for me that it was another I should
[02:52:41] have known better especially having been through oh six more body that the mental preparation
[02:52:48] required and I think I talked to you but for me that preparation was getting in the mind said that
[02:52:54] I would not come home and for that first op and sawter city I was I don't I was not there yet
[02:53:04] and I was the navigator and let us in actually that was we were inserted by the army
[02:53:12] some local armor in the area and we were trying to get to our target site and we got
[02:53:20] compromised they were lookouts there and I missed my opportunity to engage those lookouts
[02:53:30] and we eventually got we got attacked from the rooftops there were RPGs there were sustained
[02:53:40] automatic fire and we had a call in for you know you were for help to get out of that area
[02:53:46] so it was a welcome back into the fray of things and I if I talked to other people I don't
[02:53:56] know I don't think they would probably call me on say you did bad job on that but I think personally
[02:54:02] I feel I've carried that with me just prompts and like you're getting getting locked on and
[02:54:11] getting back on track so that's specifically the first op yeah and the reason I specifically asked
[02:54:18] you about the first op is because after the first op which I know was was was not a good
[02:54:24] operation because Seth called me and was like horrified at the way the whole thing went down he
[02:54:33] of course said he totally screwed it up and he needed to reset and Mike's really says the same
[02:54:38] exact thing you know he made mistakes and he they didn't do the right so it's like everybody
[02:54:46] everybody that I know personally was all like they felt awful about that first operation
[02:54:54] and it was only by the grace of God that it wasn't like a mass casualty scenario
[02:55:03] I mean it's funny I have never had this conversation with Mike or the Seth anyone else
[02:55:12] it's kind of funny you saying these things like we all are saying the same things and trying
[02:55:17] to take accountability for how that went you know it was eye opening and I mean they brought it
[02:55:24] the enemy brought it and we were in for a rude awakening but in a lot of ways it helped us
[02:55:35] for the future ops because we had good successful ops that made an impact later on it's just that
[02:55:42] first one was I don't know here right there were there were RPGs that were really close we
[02:55:51] and by the grace of God we had our army brothers there to support us really so I can't give enough
[02:56:02] props to to guys to our brothers like that yeah it's one of those you know and I'm sure
[02:56:13] Mike and I will go into a bigger debrief at some point on this from his perspective I wish
[02:56:18] Seth I wish I would hit record you know whenever he called me years ago on a on a secure
[02:56:25] line to kind of debrief me but what I think is awesome and definitely get this from Mike and
[02:56:30] which is like you guys could have walked out of that walked off that operation you know completed
[02:56:39] that mission and gone into freaking hiding like just been like this is not going to work this is
[02:56:45] we're we're not ready for this all those things but I think it's a great example of okay
[02:56:54] stand down for 72 hours we got to do some rehearsals we got to do some drills we got to get our
[02:56:58] shit together and then we'll do this properly and so often people take a hit you know they
[02:57:07] they make a mistake and their attitude is oh no I'm not capable doing this see I'm wrong I'm a
[02:57:12] disaster instead of instead of assessing it going okay here's the mistake you got made here's the
[02:57:18] mistakes that got made here's the things we need to change here's the rehearsal we need to do here's
[02:57:21] the planning we need to put into place you do an assessment and like you just said you learn from your
[02:57:27] mistakes and you make adjustments I mean it's the same thing with the blue on blue we had arriving in
[02:57:32] Ramadhi it's like okay look we got away without one relatively light relatively light I mean
[02:57:41] we we hey on Iraqi soldier was killed that was awful a couple Iraqi soldiers were wounded
[02:57:47] we had one guy get fragged in the face but compared to what could have happened we got off light
[02:57:54] and same thing we didn't say well there's two things we didn't do we didn't say well that wasn't our
[02:57:58] fault and that you know it was like no this is my fault and here's what we're gonna do to fix it
[02:58:04] and that's the same attitude that you guys had that first operation at Sander City which was okay
[02:58:11] we made mistakes there are fault we're gonna fix them and we're gonna go back and get after it
[02:58:16] direct parallels with that blue on blue incident we had compared to the first off we had
[02:58:26] in Tatar City and I remember you know it was a four man element with some Iraqis you know
[02:58:32] I don't want to say names but I was with that forward recon element and just the Swiss cheese
[02:58:40] model Murphy's law it went bad quick and like you said someone got shot in the face and
[02:58:51] alright Iraqi died and someone was fragged and I played a role in that that was the first
[02:58:59] firefight I caught in and it was one of the worst ones and now that I have had a little bit more
[02:59:08] experience to kind of understand that when you're receiving sustained 50-count fire in multiple
[02:59:14] automatic weapons fire you're probably not fighting the enemy you think you're fighting and that was
[02:59:20] because we were fighting greens and a whole company by rackies who were painting us down and it's amazing
[02:59:26] that we didn't lose anyone on that and I by the grace I threw a couple of racks immediately
[02:59:37] that was one of my first reactions and thankfully I did not cook those fracks for those who don't know
[02:59:43] cooking a frag means you pulled the ring and there's a little bit of time you know
[02:59:54] what's the latest you five seconds allegedly yeah and you hold it release and cook it you
[03:00:02] know count one with thousand two and thousand three and the idea is that when you throw it there's not enough time
[03:00:07] for the person you're throwing it to pick it up and throw it back at you right thankfully I did not
[03:00:11] cook those grenades and I talked to some of the marine angle code that was on the ground there and they said
[03:00:17] my frag just rolled by and thankfully he had enough time to get out of the way and that's me that's on me
[03:00:24] it's and I remember distinctly after that event you came in we were in the platoon hot
[03:00:34] in he asked us like you're going around like who's fault is this and like I think Jeremy
[03:00:41] raised his hands like it's my fault and I don't know it's like my fault and you really know
[03:00:47] it's my fault and you went on to talk about why and you assumed responsibility and I didn't know
[03:00:58] what at the time being just a young kid watching all this taken it all in but it had a formative
[03:01:03] impact on me of assuming command and responsibility when you are the leader because the book stops with you
[03:01:12] and just taking unconscious notes about that interaction but that had a huge formative
[03:01:26] that was a very formative experience for me and it parallels exactly what we were just talking
[03:01:30] about with that first op and solder city I would love to talk to Mike about it one day the next time I see
[03:01:38] him yeah what could you guys both in here we'll do a full full debrief so that that those operations
[03:01:45] in solder city though man after that so just a couple things solder city had been a total disaster
[03:01:54] four years so that was 2008 it been a disaster since 2003 the enemy was in control of that area
[03:02:01] the entire time the army finally said they're gonna do something about it the army started building a wall
[03:02:08] the enemy for roachiously attacked it was devastating and you guys rolled in there after the first
[03:02:16] op obviously things went bad and and and and and then you guys got in your rhythm you figured out
[03:02:22] you corrected your mistakes and you guys started executing these missions in support of the army
[03:02:30] and started killing a lot of bad guys and I I want to say it was about six weeks after about six
[03:02:39] weeks the enemy surrendered for all practical purposes the people that were leading the insurgents
[03:02:46] inside that area said okay yeah yeah we're done we're done so a problem that had been a problem for five years
[03:02:53] was over in about six weeks and again I'm I'm breezing through that because you guys did some
[03:03:03] harling missions in there and took a lot of risk to go in there and make that happen but it was my
[03:03:09] point is that it was risky yes but very effective in in subdoing a previously just savage enemy that
[03:03:20] did not care I don't know if too many things in this life that are good things that are without risk
[03:03:30] and that goes to every facet of life of business a combat of space exploration all good things
[03:03:40] have a lot of risk and a lot of hard work to get there and certainly combat operations there were no
[03:03:47] different now at what point did you start thinking about you know going to become a doctor
[03:03:57] that was in remoney so when you did your initial application it was between
[03:04:05] deployments is that right yes so the story that I mentioned earlier of me being like I don't
[03:04:11] know why you don't want to be a doctor it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard being a team
[03:04:15] guys the best thing in the world why would you trade in an M60 for a scalpel so we actually had
[03:04:22] that conversation in between we did I remember very well I just a giant I don't know why you want
[03:04:29] to do this but I will support you you know and you had my back like I would never want to do this
[03:04:36] but good on you for the one and a do is and I'll support you in every way and I mean that letter you
[03:04:40] read at the start of this brought back some memories I the very powerful words and like
[03:04:47] undeserving kind words I had not heard that in many years when did you find out you got picked up
[03:04:56] was that before deployment that was during I think during deployment so I decided I was going to go
[03:05:03] into stay 21 that for those who don't know that's the elicit to officer commissioning program
[03:05:08] so that I can go to medical school and I knew I wanted to do it after coming out of a
[03:05:12] Romadi but I thought it was poor form and really I could embarrass to leave my
[03:05:23] petune after especially at the one one deployment and what kind of what is that I
[03:05:29] already feel bad enough that I've only done two deployments and I am aware that I am a
[03:05:37] representative of the seal teams in what I do now which unfortunately I say unfortunately because
[03:05:46] I don't appreciate the the spotlight I was of what I have to do as a national
[03:05:54] not but I am a representative of the teams and to me that's kind of crazy like I do not
[03:06:01] deserve to be a representative of the teams I'm a two pump jump you want me to be representative
[03:06:08] of the teams and I do it with honor and seriousness and I will do I will never do anything to
[03:06:14] disgrace the teams I hold and covet that honor more than anything and I will defend it
[03:06:23] at all costs but I just talking just being here it's just like people will see it and
[03:06:30] see me as a representative and it's humbling in many ways and it I take it seriously
[03:06:38] so I wanted to at least get two deployments and because I felt like it's like the least
[03:06:43] respectable amount of work you should do as a team guys at least two deployments
[03:06:48] so yeah that the decision was made like all right I'll put in this pack I'll time this package
[03:06:52] in so that I'm getting a decision yesterday as I'm coming off of the signal deployment
[03:06:56] and that's what happened I found out and then maybe just before we left or maybe during
[03:07:01] deployment that I was accepted into the program and so you come home from that deployment
[03:07:10] you had you guys had a little bit of time to decompress during that deployment
[03:07:13] because the solder city fighting was in the beginning of the deployment relatively close
[03:07:17] you guys got done and and then it was you know kind of what I said earlier was hey back to some
[03:07:23] outstations relatively mellow compared to either a, Romadi or b, solder city
[03:07:32] then I mean not to dismiss what the work we did and the work that other people did but if
[03:07:37] the combat operations intensity was night and day difference I mean we were working at an
[03:07:43] up-house in Rupa and doing a lot of long range reconnaissance missions on side by side which are basically
[03:07:49] high powered tactical go-carts going hundreds of miles and just traversing the desert in
[03:07:56] these getting paid to do it but it was definitely different because I fired my rifle almost
[03:08:05] every single operation in Romadi I could probably count on one hand like the times that didn't
[03:08:13] like when there was a mission where I didn't fire all the same within solder city every
[03:08:20] I don't feel there was a single lot operation we did where I didn't fire my rifle
[03:08:25] but in Rupa it afterwards I didn't I don't think I fired it once except on the range
[03:08:30] so I make sure it's said it didn't so it's just just a different contrast you know people
[03:08:35] had different experiences based on where they are yeah and there's different missions there's
[03:08:39] different things that people have to do and I say this you know I'll have guys come up to me and say
[03:08:43] you know I was in the I was in the Marine Corps from you know 1994 to 1998 and I never did anything
[03:08:48] and I feel guilty and I'm like hey you did what the country needed you to do you did what America
[03:08:52] needed you to do that's what you did and so you get assigned different missions in any unit and you
[03:08:59] do what you're assigned to do you do to the best of your ability and you know in this case it's a
[03:09:04] little bit of a nice little decompression riding around the desert in ATVs with relatively low
[03:09:10] threat you know and then you come home from that deployment and now now it's time to go to college
[03:09:18] how will do you at this point? see so this is 2000 and eight so I do a public math here
[03:09:28] so did me to put you out in the spot there rock and scientist I was at 24 so you're 24 years old yeah
[03:09:39] I went to college and you went to University of San Diego I went to University of San Diego I was a 28 year old
[03:09:46] no I was a 30 year old completely military institutionalized grown man with no
[03:09:54] like ability to fit in with civilians and I showed off the college and so it was awesome
[03:10:04] and and what what did you major math and did you know at this point you want to kick ass get
[03:10:10] great grades and get into a really good medical school yes that was the plan to I so the program I was
[03:10:18] accepted the seamen animal program was specifically to go to medicine so and the Navy does they
[03:10:25] think a huge gamble because they're accepting you for this program putting a lot of money in you
[03:10:29] and you're not even accepted to college art to college or medical school so they're hoping that you
[03:10:35] will do well enough in college to be accepted to medical school and if it was the same as you you
[03:10:40] only have three years to do an undergraduate degree so you get squash a four year degree in three
[03:10:46] years and for me I also had to get the prerequisites to go to medical school so that was you know full
[03:10:52] time status working summer school working winter doing winter classes you have to go to ROTC I did
[03:11:00] and I also gave up parking tickets to pay for tuition you're one of those guys I just want
[03:11:06] you know the world finally loses respect for Johnny Kim in some way you know what I
[03:11:12] um it was a humbling job on it I think it was good for my soul so ROTC can be hard for former
[03:11:21] elicit because you you you you might be a battle hard and better and no one care and people care
[03:11:30] you have to suck in take that humble pill and realize that you were just another midshyman with the other
[03:11:36] 18 19 year old kids and for some people it's hard to do that right because you had to suck in your
[03:11:42] pride take that humble pill and just follow and do these things that are I don't want to say dumb but
[03:11:50] kind of well they're aimed at young inexperienced untrained off-circuited it's that have no
[03:11:59] that have no experience in the military that's who they're aimed at yes they're not aimed at
[03:12:03] guys that have been in the teams on two combat deployments responsible for all kinds of stuff
[03:12:09] they're not aimed at you and so when they hit you they sting but you let them but in that respect
[03:12:18] it is an opportunity to exercise humility and to be able to suck in your pride because that goes
[03:12:25] that is in the same spirit of when someone says or does something to you that gets you emotional
[03:12:31] and you having the mental fortitude to step back put your own emotions aside to get to communicate
[03:12:40] to the person to find common ground in the same way that's how I saw that opportunity to suck in
[03:12:47] my to get that practice at humility and I didn't I wasn't always good at it you know because sometimes
[03:12:53] you're fed up like mustering a 0 500 when the muster is really like 0 700 like why am I here
[03:12:59] for 2 hours because you know maybe the squallie to put 15 minutes of grace time before like the
[03:13:05] company commander before the fake you know like rotsy leader or whatever and then eventually
[03:13:11] works out there you're like 2 hours before you're there standing there 2 hours of attention before
[03:13:15] you need to be there you know like little things like that and for some especially I saw some
[03:13:19] former enlisted having a really hard time keeping their thoughts to themselves team guys are even worse
[03:13:30] yes so it is an exercise in humility and giving parking tickets was the same way because
[03:13:39] the stay 21 was very generous but it only gives 10,000 of tuition but it gives you time you're
[03:13:46] I'm not trying to dismiss the benefits of the program it was I'm very grateful for that but I had to
[03:13:51] make up an extra $20,000 and the university of San Diego was kind enough to offer me a job hey you
[03:13:58] give up parking tickets for eight hours a week and we will cover the rest so I give up parking tickets and
[03:14:06] some may see that like oh wow you went from doing these combat operations to give it in combat
[03:14:10] to give in parking tickets like well for me it was an exercise in humility and just there's
[03:14:16] you should never think you're too good to do a job and I think you should be like that and everything
[03:14:20] you do be for ever new guy is what I try to emulate and I don't mean as in you shouldn't step up to the
[03:14:29] role and be a leader and delicate appropriately but never think that you are above taking out the trash or
[03:14:35] that you're above not respecting the secretary or the lowest junior and listed right I mean that's
[03:14:44] I was there you were there and we were both E-wands you're the bottom of the bottom
[03:14:48] by the food chain, mop and floors taking out the trash and I remember what Tony, Tony afraid
[03:14:56] he said to me when I first showed up he was like never think you're too good to take out the trash
[03:15:00] now I take that to the heart like to this day never too good to do those jobs because
[03:15:08] the moment you start to think you're better than anyone else you have you have poisoned yourself
[03:15:14] you were on the dark path so given out parking tickets was well I'm thankful I got to give
[03:15:22] about parking tickets to really nice cars and universities and we married yet I got married
[03:15:30] during a while in my college and I had my first child my wife and I had our first child
[03:15:37] during university in the year then when do you start applying for med school
[03:15:45] so I applied between second and third year of the university in the summertime
[03:15:53] did you think you'd where do you apply everywhere I applied yeah every I think applied
[03:15:58] like 10 to 15 schools I applied to some really nice schools and you know I told you earlier
[03:16:04] that all my father wanted me to do was go to Harvard medical school and that's not the reason
[03:16:09] at least like at least I tell myself that's not the reason why I did it and maybe it
[03:16:12] is maybe some psychologists listening to this like oh that's totally why you went there
[03:16:17] but for and for me it was I had it was very impactful having friends
[03:16:27] Ryan Mike Mark JT I could go on of the people who have sacrificed
[03:16:35] and were much braver than I could ever be and that does a couple things to you it
[03:16:40] it humbles you for life I think if you remember that right knowing that no matter what you do
[03:16:45] in this lifetime it will never be enough and not that it's comparison but that pursuit
[03:16:50] is important but it made me want to fill in that void to make up for the good they would have
[03:16:57] done and that's how a lot of us honor our friends it's certainly how I honor my friends
[03:17:04] and for me that's being as impactful as possible to this world it doesn't matter what
[03:17:10] that is it could be in the form of serving as a team guy or serving as a physician
[03:17:15] or what my path is taking me to now as serving as a nationalat I wanted to be impactful
[03:17:23] and to me going to Harvard was giving me a better a bigger platform to be impactful it wasn't
[03:17:31] the name it wasn't the brand it wasn't the education you be fooling yourself to think that
[03:17:36] going to Harvard is going to make you a better doctor that's not true at all you would be just as
[03:17:40] good of a doctor anywhere you go to in this country but it was having a platform to be able to
[03:17:47] affect positive change that's why I wanted to go to an institution like John Hopkins or
[03:17:55] Harvard really and for me that transition the years of university San Diego and the early years of
[03:18:05] medical school or the hardest sometimes it's hard it's weird to say but some of the hardest
[03:18:09] years of my life because it was different I couldn't grind through it by just hitting harder
[03:18:16] with the way this is going from university San Diego to Harvard or just going from the team
[03:18:21] so you're just going okay at transition it was some of the hardest years of my life because
[03:18:26] it's not like you could just push through like you can in some of the things you do in
[03:18:30] the bloods or in teams and the bloods is a challenge but as you and I know training is nothing
[03:18:36] compared to war but you think training is hard you think how weak is hard it's hard right
[03:18:41] until you get hit in the face in a real combat operation and then you realize oh
[03:18:48] I've reset my benchmark for what is hard or what is painful or what is suffering and
[03:18:53] even having that benchmark going into transitioning to civilian life it was hard for me
[03:19:02] I was trying to fit in four year degree in three years trying to do really well because I knew
[03:19:07] I had a good grades to be considered for a school like Harvard I had my first child
[03:19:13] I was working part time but probably the worst of it was I was not right
[03:19:19] in the head with my decompression with post war I took a lot of that anger and hatred my
[03:19:31] heart and I still had it there and I lost a little bit of who I was and reg it took years
[03:19:37] for me to regain that and it was only through the grace of time of
[03:19:45] sometimes prayer, a friends, of mentors, of making mistakes that I was able to find that light
[03:19:58] and get a little bit back of who I was and learn through the process. What did it look like when
[03:20:04] how did that how did that anger and hatred manifested itself when you're at the University of San Diego
[03:20:12] on a sunny day and you're in the library and you've got to turn it a paper.
[03:20:17] So I have never even I haven't really talked about this but for me I felt I had a huge obligation
[03:20:32] to work as hard as I could to do the things I wanted to do because I owed it to Mark and Mikey
[03:20:38] and Ryan. It didn't manifest itself in the libraries of the University of San Diego. It
[03:20:47] manifested itself in my relationships with people I loved and not that I was I became my father
[03:20:54] and was abusive or verbally abusive to the people but I took my anger out in less than healthy ways.
[03:21:00] I am sad and embarrassed to admit but I get the little things would take me off and I would find
[03:21:11] myself punching a wall or breaking something and I think about that now and I understand that
[03:21:22] the frame of mine I was in and the kind of hurt I was in post-war and I just didn't
[03:21:28] have the healthiest way to deal with that and now that years have gone by and I've talking to
[03:21:34] our own classmates who have gone through their own battles the demons post-war realize I wasn't the
[03:21:41] only one but a lot of it I had to deal with on my own or through the patience of my wife who has
[03:21:49] been my biggest support through all of this. It took years for me to learn to be human again,
[03:22:02] to let go of that anger, to sublimate all those experiences, all that raw emotions and to good
[03:22:11] and when I think about some of my behavior the universe and not that I was out of completely
[03:22:21] out of line or anything I mean I was a good student I did well if you talk to people who I was
[03:22:26] in class with I mean I was not controversial in any ways but when I had started painting
[03:22:33] I was respectful and I voiced them and one of the biggest hard for me to say it I still to this
[03:22:48] day have hard time saying it just because it's it's just a word that's not it's very foreign to
[03:22:55] someone who is a seal. The learning to lower my defenses and be vulnerable was the light one of the
[03:23:06] biggest lights for me learning to be more of a human and that happened in medical school. It was
[03:23:18] I remember this why I had an experience in medical school where we do these talks about our
[03:23:24] experiences in the hospital and we were talking about like something called the hidden curriculum
[03:23:30] I can even tell you what that is now but it was we were talking I mean I was to say it was a
[03:23:36] touchy feeling kind of conversation was that's basically kind of what it was and I was I hated
[03:23:42] these talks I hated talking about it about my feelings to my classmates and a lot I think a lot of
[03:23:51] it was just pride because I was like I've been through so much more than dealing with the expectation
[03:23:59] of our supervisors in this medical school and this hidden curriculum and the difficulties
[03:24:07] of dealing with sick and dying patients like I've been through worse like I don't want to talk
[03:24:11] about my feelings and it made for a very rough person to be around and I don't think I
[03:24:20] wore my emotion to my face and I just didn't participate in the discussions and I had two
[03:24:26] caring physicians professors at the time pull me into our office and like look it's very visible
[03:24:33] that you don't enjoy these conversations and you pull a computer and your heart to talk to
[03:24:39] you and you detach yourself and like what's what's going on like this is a serious problem
[03:24:46] and I took that to heart and I examined where I was coming from and I realized that I just
[03:24:56] I didn't want to be vulnerable I didn't want to talk about my feelings this way because there was a
[03:24:59] lot of other things a lot of other baggage I had I had still but having that conversation and that
[03:25:06] guidance to open up really helped me become a better human in many ways which then led to being a
[03:25:16] better follower being a better leader so those are one of many experiences in that phase of life
[03:25:24] that helped me be a better candidate for NASA and for for other opportunities that have come
[03:25:33] I'm trying to overlay my own experiences you know kind of parallel to years and just thinking about things
[03:25:44] and I again I always say I got very very lucky one of the things that I got incredibly lucky
[03:25:50] with was when we got home from Romani two things happened number one I had a wife and three kids
[03:25:58] all at the optimum age as far as I can can tell the optimum age to connect with in the
[03:26:12] their their young enough that they're looking at you like you're a superhero they're old enough
[03:26:18] that they're not babies and I can see in their eyes like their people I guess that's the that's
[03:26:25] the big point like they were old enough they were in that age group you know three four five
[03:26:30] six years old where they're looking at me I'm looking at a little person right so I have that going on
[03:26:36] and plus my wife of course so I'm coming home to that and then at the same time I take over the training
[03:26:44] and where I'm around team guys not only my around team guys but all these little emotions that you
[03:26:51] have well you went through work up when I was running training with Seth like I was allowed
[03:26:58] to express my emotions about the teams and doing a good job and cover move and you better
[03:27:06] hey leader you better step up and take charge and hey you better get out like not only was I
[03:27:11] allowed do that it was beneficial for the guys that were going through the training because they
[03:27:15] got to see that I really cared about this and I didn't want anything to happen to them and like
[03:27:20] that so I got to like let those emotions out enough and then at the same time in my home life I was
[03:27:29] like oh I was looking at a little human being and going wait a second I can't this isn't this isn't
[03:27:36] to place to be emotional or be angry this kids looking at me like I'm a superhero and like I should
[03:27:43] become and that's what I'm going to be so kind of a cool very lucky situation that on the one hand I
[03:27:49] got to express and be around team guys and be raw as raw could be with team guys and at the same time
[03:27:56] learn that oh by the way you know it's not normal to it always freaked out late and Seth that I would
[03:28:04] go home and I never would swear in front of my kids and like obviously in front of a sealed
[03:28:09] tutor I would just go off and I'd come home and just be I don't want to say I'd be a different person
[03:28:14] but it kind of be a different person you know I'd kind of learned to all right this is okay over here
[03:28:20] it's not okay over there you look at a you look at a five-year-old girl or a you know a four-year-old boy
[03:28:27] and you go you know what this kid's counting on me to make some halfway decent decisions and I think
[03:28:34] that made me very quickly um figure out what I needed to do to move forward and um whereas for you
[03:28:47] I'm sitting there drawing that parallel course you're getting taken from that team guy environment
[03:28:54] to this non-teen guy environment to the end degree and boom here you go you got to box all that stuff up
[03:29:02] and figure out what to do with it real quick and and there's no real good outlet and the outlet becomes
[03:29:09] you know the wall the freaking plate the whatever that anger needs an outlet and
[03:29:16] when you let it out it's not the best place and it takes you a little while to figure out okay I see what's
[03:29:20] going on here yeah what you described took me years to learn and it is
[03:29:29] probably one of the most important traits of being a leader is having one the emotional and social
[03:29:42] intelligence of knowing your audience knowing who you're talking to and being dynamic enough
[03:29:48] that you can switch and craft your language your body language your tone of voice everything you do
[03:29:55] to suit the person you're talking to you can the way I would talk to a puttune seals
[03:30:05] would be very different then the way I would talk to a 60 year old COPD patient and COPD is like
[03:30:14] a long disease from common in folks who smoke who is in the hospital for the end of the time
[03:30:22] who wants to quit smoking and is frustrated and needs some guidance that patient is a different
[03:30:29] population and being able to have the clarity and intelligence to know that and to switch your language
[03:30:38] appropriately is so important to yield results and that goes for everything I'm you just that's why
[03:30:47] blanket leadership tenants don't work guiding principles work but you need a format
[03:30:57] to your own style to achieve the results and I think a lot of it starts with awareness
[03:31:04] with mindfulness of your own emotions of the emotions the body language that others are telling
[03:31:10] you because it gives you hints as to what they're feeling and if you know what they're feeling
[03:31:15] you understand where they're coming from that perspective you can disarm people by finding common ground
[03:31:23] and achieving results because most of the time all people want good things they just disagree on
[03:31:33] how to achieve that yeah the some you're gonna I'm gonna give you copy this new book I wrote
[03:31:40] in your book oh cool I'm glad we talked about everything that's in that book today so so much of this
[03:31:46] stuff is exactly what I talk about one of the things I talk about there in there is you know modulating
[03:31:52] you know how you have to modulate your leadership principles and how you know you can't use the same
[03:31:56] tool with one person the same way you use that same tool with a different person the same way you use it
[03:32:01] with someone else you have to understand who you're dealing with and figure out how much of that
[03:32:07] specific tool to apply if you can even use that tool because different people respond differently to different
[03:32:14] things absolutely you know what I wish I'm gonna admit I have not read any of your books
[03:32:22] but I've learned from watching you from watching lathe from watching other leaders you know Scott
[03:32:28] who is my next OSC and mentors along the road and making mistakes all these tried and true lessons
[03:32:36] I've been fortunate to make those mistakes and learn from them and you know I wish I had
[03:32:45] a book like that to teach me but maybe wouldn't have been effective maybe it requires a little
[03:32:50] bit of suffering through those mistakes to really hit home there's there's certain things that you
[03:32:55] can learn from a book there's certain things you can't one thing that's nice is you for people
[03:32:59] that give me feedback on these books. Lay for give lay feedback on these books is if they have a
[03:33:05] little bit of context man you look at them and you go every but every single person that reads
[03:33:10] one of these books because I wish I would add this book and you know what I respond with I wish I had
[03:33:14] it too I wish I'd have to learn these lessons the hard way but sometimes sometimes sometimes that's
[03:33:20] the way you're gonna learn them but sometimes I mean it's not like anything we've talked about
[03:33:24] today is super novel that people haven't heard you need there's a right time and a right place to
[03:33:31] hear the lesson and advice and sometimes I'm certain a lot of the lessons I follow and principal
[03:33:38] guiding principles I live by every day I'm serving with humility remembering the sacrifices of others
[03:33:45] respecting everyone not taking things for granted those were said to me as a kid I just wasn't in the
[03:33:52] right frame of mind to receive those lessons so I firmly believe that people need to be ready
[03:33:59] to be mentored and to be taught well that's the that's what he melodies all about right and
[03:34:06] that one of the things that I talk about is the one person that you can't turn into a good
[03:34:11] leader is the one that's not humble because they're not listening to what you say and they're not
[03:34:15] accepting any guidance and so you're not gonna be able to get them to move in the right direction
[03:34:20] they're just gonna continue to suck as a leader so you get into Harvard and you know I know
[03:34:31] I read that letter that I know I know Rayford wrote you letters I mean we all did everything we could
[03:34:35] to support you getting in you got into Harvard but then the navy wasn't gonna let you go
[03:34:45] what happened that's right
[03:34:46] I haven't thought about this in a long time because this is why you owe me a six pack
[03:34:54] more than that so when the instruction for this seeming to animal program I was in was written
[03:35:03] it didn't take into context the various programs that would be there to support medical school
[03:35:10] and I can throw out a bunch of fancy language but basically there were three avenues to go to
[03:35:16] medical school through the military there was useis the uniform services of health science
[03:35:24] I yes the military medical school there was two routes to go to a civilian medical school one was
[03:35:32] basically a scholarship where they paid for school and another one was they keep you active duty
[03:35:39] as an unlisted person but you would have to pay your own tuition
[03:35:42] me having already been in the navy for ten years wanted to stay in the navy for many reasons
[03:35:51] one I had already had a scholarship to Harvard as well as generous financially that paid a hundred
[03:35:58] percent of my tuition so I didn't need the scholarship to pay for school what I did need
[03:36:04] was the trich hair benefits and the salary to support my growing family into the navy it's
[03:36:10] it's essentially the same cost right so my program the seaming animal program did not take into consideration
[03:36:19] the program where you stay in listed and there wasn't because it wasn't a good route it just
[03:36:26] wasn't considered because the time of the instruction was written that in listed program wasn't written
[03:36:32] and I wanted to apply to that on the program but was being told by my my you know my
[03:36:41] superiors at the rots unit that I couldn't do it because of the instruction and that's I'm
[03:36:48] for I am not I am not a believer in circumventing the chain of command and in this case I let my
[03:37:02] who's a lieutenant like proctor let him know like I'd like to see if I can pursue this avenue
[03:37:09] and a parallel path and trying to get approval for this and the response I got was a good luck and
[03:37:18] that's when I reached out to you and told you the situation and you asked a specific officer
[03:37:29] who I still actually keep in touch with because I remember he did not know who I was but
[03:37:35] the very fact that we were both from the same brotherhood from teams that he went out of his way
[03:37:42] and he was working I think in buepers or some personnel command that had access to these types
[03:37:48] to the people that can make these types of decisions and he was able to secure or at least share
[03:37:53] this story what I was going through to the right people and once those right people heard the
[03:37:58] situation is like well that's easy of course it just wasn't it wasn't considered because it's a
[03:38:02] clerical thing not because it's not like shouldn't be allowed so once the right people heard
[03:38:07] the story that yeah absolutely will support you and it wouldn't have been made possible if it wasn't
[03:38:13] for the support of the teams yeah that was awesome and my role was just knowing who to call
[03:38:20] and you know I had you know no power but the people that people that you know and the
[03:38:26] relationship that you build over time is like hey guys here's what's going on and the
[03:38:31] guys that are in powerful positions or in the right position and the right spot with the right
[03:38:36] poll can make things happen and and they do it for the right reasons why like just like you
[03:38:40] said it wasn't because it wasn't the right thing was absolutely the right thing to do it's like
[03:38:44] hey we got an opportunity for a guy to go to Harvard Medical School and be able to support his
[03:38:49] family with what he's doing that who who could possibly think that's not a freaking awesome idea
[03:38:55] and that's all it needed just needed a little light shed on it I'll always be indebted in great
[03:39:01] for the action to those to go out on a limb and support me and I think like you said it goes to
[03:39:10] show when you are in a position to be able to help someone and it's for the right reasons and it's
[03:39:15] done responsibly you should do that that's the right human thing to do is to help others on their path
[03:39:22] now what when you said going from US going from the teams to USD and then from USD
[03:39:29] to medical school you said that was a hard transition too going to medical school was that
[03:39:34] am I catching that right did I hear that right was not as Harvard transition as the teams
[03:39:39] to just civilian life in general I would say that that and that was like the transitions to the
[03:39:44] teams to non teams because you said to yourself but I joined the Navy at 18 years old I was
[03:39:52] completely indoctrinated into the military and you like to think there's bubbles everywhere right we
[03:39:59] all everyone lives in a bubble to a certain extent and in the military we like to pride ourselves
[03:40:05] in a plethora of wide ranging experiences but if you think and we like to compare ourselves to
[03:40:12] maybe civilians or people who are not don't have those opportunities to get those types of
[03:40:18] overseas experiences but if you think for a second that you may not be in a bubble yourself just
[03:40:23] because you're in the military you're wrong I was in that bubble and I quickly discovered that I was
[03:40:31] indoctrinated and yes I went to a very liberal arts college and I may not have
[03:40:39] agreed with everything that was discussed but you know what learning to respectfully voice my opinion
[03:40:45] and listen to others voice their opinions is so important to being a productive member of society
[03:40:52] so I am so thankful that I was able to step outside of my bubble into the civilian world and see
[03:41:00] how operations are done on that side and I it just helped me be a more rounded person a more rounded
[03:41:07] human being and I'm so thankful it's just that it was very painful because I was not ready for
[03:41:15] that transition and I don't I think a lot of veterans are not ready as well and I think that's
[03:41:19] why it's a lot of times it's hard for veterans to transition from the military into civilian life
[03:41:27] how hard was a Harvard medical school for you it was it was hard it was
[03:41:34] what does a day look like or what is a week either a day or a week like what does that look like
[03:41:38] going Harvard medical school I mean for me was juggling the demand of a growing family you know
[03:41:45] my head my first child my second child was born during medical school my third child is born
[03:41:50] during internship so you didn't get my sleep and you just learned to optimize your day like you
[03:41:57] can't make more hours in a day and this is when I learned that becoming a morning person was
[03:42:02] a better way to optimize my day so and I I am not a genius by any means I consider myself very
[03:42:11] average physically mentally it's just that I feel that I can stick with the goals and have
[03:42:18] deferred gratification to help support me for my goals that's it work working hard is all I know
[03:42:26] I can do to make up for any advantages natural or otherwise that I don't have so I do feel that
[03:42:34] I had to study more than the average student at Harvard medical school and there were some smart
[03:42:39] folks there and on top of having personal responsibilities to being a father and a husband
[03:42:46] those were challenging so I learned that hey I need to wake up super early study in my most
[03:42:53] optimum time workout and that's it was just learning these changes to optimize my life
[03:43:01] how early would you wake up in medical school I was waking up around 330
[03:43:09] and then what you maintain your workouts all the time no at what point at what was that kind of
[03:43:15] one of the early things to go did you hang on to it as long as you could it it lost I lost it my
[03:43:20] first year and I I you know in your 20s you can eat junk food you can get away with all these
[03:43:27] things you can work off any bad diet you have as you get to your later 20s and your 30s like you
[03:43:34] can't do that you have to eat well and I was getting I was overweight in first year of med school
[03:43:41] and there came a point like I can't do this to myself like this main team in my health is
[03:43:47] for my sanity for my health and I owe it like I don't care if I'm super busy I should be
[03:43:55] able to find a half hour an hour and so I would say towards the second and third I'm just
[03:43:59] that first year I lost sight of that and then after that bought a treadmill bought weights
[03:44:06] in our my little basement so I had no reason not to work out so then I was waking up super early
[03:44:11] giving my work out in first thing in the morning and then just trying to crush as much studying
[03:44:15] as I could in the in the morning hours because I knew once I came home from school there's no work
[03:44:21] getting done for hours because my son and my wife I mean they I need to be there for them and a
[03:44:27] lot of times it wasn't I was not the best husband and father during those years
[03:44:36] and that's because you got an exam in two days or you got a paper do and then just that's you're just
[03:44:40] don't you can't do it yeah I I was not I don't think able to do that very well I tried but I
[03:44:49] I think I could have done better at what point did you decide maybe going into space would be a good
[03:44:56] idea so we talked about accidents and we call whatever we want I have no plan I had no plan to do
[03:45:03] any of these things I we talked about I had no plan to be a doctor it's just something that came
[03:45:07] out of deployment of a body of seeing the compassion and the good that physicians and nurses were
[03:45:16] doing to our brothers and sisters who were wounded in combat and I wanted to be able to do that type
[03:45:21] of good as well and that's why I directed to medicine space was never on the horizon we talked a
[03:45:27] little bit about where I came from that scared little boy and grew up under my father shadow I
[03:45:35] never thought I could have been a seal or a doctor or an astronaut there's no way it was a different
[03:45:44] life and I was a different person and the first time I heard about NASA and this opportunity I don't
[03:45:55] I don't have a great story for it it's just I heard about being national and it's like that's kind of
[03:46:03] interesting when we're like other than space exploration like what you do and learning about the
[03:46:08] impact that national arts can have on our next generation and what Apollo did for our country I mean
[03:46:15] in the 60s we were able to land a human on the moon with that technology
[03:46:23] despite a growing race with Russia and all the politics going on during that era
[03:46:32] Kennedy's assassination we were able to complete that and that secured American preeminence
[03:46:39] in science technology for decades to come I certainly believe that and the benefits we got from that
[03:46:47] are you can't count that and learning a little bit more about that and how astronauts have
[03:46:54] had the opportunity to represent humanity for good and bring together countries in a way that
[03:47:05] politics and alliances cannot do when you talk to some of the Apollo astronauts who landed on the moon
[03:47:13] and they did their international travel the comment the feedback they would get from people would be
[03:47:20] we did it we did it together it wasn't you Americans did it it was we did it and that was
[03:47:28] powerful that countries could come together and see that as a human accomplishment so there's
[03:47:35] something about space that takes away those borders because when you're up there you don't see
[03:47:41] these distinct borders between countries you just see a lot of blue and a lot of land and you see
[03:47:48] how fragile the planet is so once I learned a little bit about that type of impact and that
[03:47:57] you can have a huge impact on the next generation of explorers of scientists of people who want to
[03:48:03] be a better version of themselves maybe I could reach out to those kids just like me who are scared
[03:48:12] tired who don't think they can amount to anything who don't think they're worth anything if I could
[03:48:20] reach out to them and let them know that hey doesn't matter where you're from with the right attitude
[03:48:28] with the right hard work if you get up every time you fail you can amount to something and you can do
[03:48:35] positive work you can leave a good impact a positive mark for our world that meant a lot to me
[03:48:45] and that's when I put my name in the hat and wanted to be a nationalot because it was completely
[03:48:53] consistent with my goals that I promised Mikey Mark Ryan long list of our brothers who are not
[03:49:01] here with us today that I would for the rest of my life do something to impact positive
[03:49:09] good in our world is it um was it is there a recruiter that comes around I mean where did you
[03:49:18] dare pick up a brochure in class where did you you must have the idea get you must have been watching
[03:49:25] you know a movie or something and gone wow that where did come from you know so I was
[03:49:30] I through just rain and circumstances got in met a action a former astronaut named Scott parents and
[03:49:37] ski who was is also a physician and served with the shuttle during the shuttle era and had a lot of
[03:49:45] great missions and a huge impact and listened to him talk passionately about our space program
[03:49:52] that kind of gave me the idea and then just like in the teams I just researched what it meant to be
[03:49:57] what the requirements were and the realized I actually like my math degree was consistent with that
[03:50:04] getting a medical degree having the operational experience working in close teams making hard
[03:50:10] decisions with limited data under constrained times those were all consistent with the traits and
[03:50:18] experiences that NASA was looking for throw so through an accident or whatever you want to call it
[03:50:25] I was able to have this privilege and honor to serve our astronaut core what's that screening
[03:50:33] process how many interviews did you go through before they gave you the yet the up check so
[03:50:41] there are I can't go into great detail of of this just because of the sensitivity around
[03:50:50] application to actually right now coisently NASA is looking for the next class of astronauts
[03:50:57] I know I saw that on your Instagram till till the end of March which Johnny Kims out recruit in the
[03:51:02] for NASA so they keep it a little bit they keep it a little bit um I don't want to say secret but
[03:51:09] they keep it somewhat a little bit of a mystery I don't say they they there's just some finer details
[03:51:16] about the process that are not generally um public knowledge I mean I think I think you're probably
[03:51:22] finding on Google there are I went through a couple interviews there's a process where you're screened
[03:51:28] based on your paper application and they reach out to references letters of recommendation
[03:51:34] and then they invite you for an interview and you're there for three or four days going through an
[03:51:39] interview doing these tests medical tests and also like teen based tests where you're working with
[03:51:47] people that you have worked before and seeing how you saw the problem and they're observing how you
[03:51:51] react all right let's see bro I know this stuff might be sensitive and everything but you got to
[03:51:55] give me at least one cool thing that they I want to know that they put you in like an escape room I
[03:52:01] want to know that you had to like they were they were had they were shouldn't paint ball at you
[03:52:06] while you were doing math problems come on give me something you know indulge my fantasy a little bit
[03:52:13] nothing like that the it was fun really really funny you do things that you have never done before
[03:52:21] there were some obstacles like you'd be like hey you get a piece of paper and you're with your
[03:52:26] your group and you're like hey you need to get to from point eight a point b but you can't touch
[03:52:31] the grass in between you in point eight point b and you might have like a barrel or a piece of wood or
[03:52:37] some string or something you need to devise a way to utilize the resources you have and work
[03:52:44] effectively in a team to like accomplish your mission and that's like just one example of some
[03:52:50] of the team based things and that's publicly out there now what what I like about that what's interesting
[03:52:56] so let's talk about this in my last book the sometimes people feel like when they when they're
[03:53:03] trying to show leadership what they need to do is like step up and tell everyone what to do and
[03:53:09] it's interesting to me because I know what you're like and I know that I know that you wouldn't
[03:53:14] necessarily be the guy who goes oh I never will listen up this is how we're going to get the barrel you
[03:53:18] be like okay let's let's figure hey anyone got a good idea what do you think of this what do you think of
[03:53:22] that and I just think it's a good I think you're like living proof because sometimes I get push back of
[03:53:30] we don't if you don't step up no one's going to notice you if you don't start barking orders no one's
[03:53:35] going to listen to you and I have to tell people over and over again that's not true I mean how many
[03:53:39] times did you hear me yell at life or Seth or anyone in task in a bruiser and our
[03:53:47] emergency single time and that's not something I would you praise in public but criticize in public is
[03:53:56] is not I cannot think of a situation where that is a good idea to humiliate or be little
[03:54:03] a subordinate that is that is not in gender trust that is a very immature thing to do and that's
[03:54:09] what we talk about like letting your motion take control your ego take control of your actions
[03:54:17] you know it's not something I've ever seen and and people look at me and they judge a book by the
[03:54:22] cover and they think oh juggle man can you imagine you must just been crazy yell it's like no
[03:54:28] no doesn't work and that's what I like about like we even just this little tidbit you're given us
[03:54:34] is to convince people to say listen if you want to be in charge that doesn't mean you bark orders
[03:54:40] actually someone that's good will start off by listening to one of the people have to say
[03:54:44] taking other opinions let's formulate a good plan together and those things are so important and
[03:54:49] it's your proof and I'm only imagining that when you were given a task there was a couple
[03:54:56] people in the group that like oh my god listen to me and I bet the the judges for lack of a better
[03:55:02] word wrote down okay bill over here he really likes to bark orders and tell everyone what to do
[03:55:08] and that's not going to go for well being part of a team absolutely I mean being good leader is
[03:55:13] being a good follower first and we talked about having that emotional human social intelligence
[03:55:20] of what to do and when to do it and how you do it and that's so important how you craft that language
[03:55:26] and that tone of voice I mean I think there is no template to leadership and people need to find
[03:55:33] their own way of executing that for me I listen I sit back and I am a big believer in quality
[03:55:44] over quantity of what you say in my experience the less you say but the more thoughtful it is
[03:55:53] the more people listen the more you speak and oftentimes when you speak a lot it's less thoughtful
[03:56:03] the less people listen yeah and I try and exercise that and everything I do especially at NASA
[03:56:13] and learning to it's very applicable in a seal puttune learning to gain currency when I mean my
[03:56:22] currency you can call it reputation whatever you want leadership capital capital gaining this capital
[03:56:29] this currency by at least what I've seen to be effective for others and myself is
[03:56:37] shutting up and doing a good job and not complaining but speaking up when it is appropriate
[03:56:44] respectfully and thoughtfully you gain that currency so that hopefully one day when you do need
[03:56:52] to bark orders because of time sensitivity or just the situation calls for it you can cash in
[03:56:59] that currency you've gained enough and that the people around your teammates be like Roger that I'm
[03:57:05] going to follow because you have gained my trust so there's a time for everything and at least
[03:57:17] for me I found that barking orders to especially to people you don't know is probably very poor form
[03:57:23] doesn't work very well and yeah the the code I have in that book over and over again is
[03:57:30] the last you talk the more people listen I in my experience I found that to be true so okay so
[03:57:38] you get selected all right and you do all kinds of cool tests did we we can't even talk about
[03:57:47] them echo Charles you know that some proof room that they do like an army get it you're watching
[03:57:52] moving I have is that the one where they blow up the meteor that's right yeah so remember
[03:57:59] they put them in that soundproof room and they give them a bunch of questions and they're like hey
[03:58:02] don't go crazy or whatever I don't remember this part but keep going I was wondering if you did that
[03:58:10] not that I remember there were some long I mean a lot of interviews a lot of tests and I mean
[03:58:20] you're running on and I really can't get into the details but taking like these personality
[03:58:24] these psychology tests yeah that's what they're trying to depict there yeah see if they could
[03:58:30] like keep it together out there whatever right yeah but it's not like I I think you can learn a lot
[03:58:39] about someone I think you learn the most about someone you squeeze them right because in an eight to five
[03:58:47] office job you can put on a mask and be whoever you want to be for that period of time you can
[03:58:53] fool a lot of people but when people are squeezed when you strip away that comfort and they're
[03:59:00] tired and hungry and cold and suffering that armor just gets melted away and you start to see
[03:59:07] true core characteristics and that's why we do hell leak and buds right you want to strip away
[03:59:14] all that armor and see what is left of that person if that is someone you want by your side
[03:59:20] when you aren't your darkest days because you're getting you're in the heat of battle and you're getting
[03:59:27] fired upon you want that person that you know is not going to quit now I'm not saying
[03:59:36] the cheapest and easiest way to find candidates is through a rock on them and say margin this
[03:59:41] direction and I won't tell you and stop when I tell you I think you would get certainly a type of
[03:59:47] profile of person to not quit and to pursue on even not knowing when they'll ever stop but that
[03:59:57] we need to be a little bit more thoughtful of who we're trying to represent our species our country
[04:00:03] for space exploration you don't want otherwise we just have a like a part of like a core of soldiers
[04:00:11] and operators but that's we want people who have that dynamic leadership who understand human
[04:00:19] emotion who can speak to a classroom of fifth graders or third graders can can gardeners
[04:00:25] and share that passion of reading or space exploration and why it's important to study the
[04:00:30] sciences but at the or at the same time talk to a group of engineers and explain to them hey
[04:00:35] respectfully why you need a window in your vehicle because to land appropriately or explaining
[04:00:45] to management why you need to do these certain training activities even though they're really
[04:00:50] expensive or there may be risk to involve like we need to maintain our currency in jets
[04:00:57] because it's an operational environment where we had to make real time decisions that have real
[04:01:03] risks so that we can stay sharp and learn to exercise that operation decision making during stressful times
[04:01:12] so you need someone who can fill all these roles in and push when going gets tough and
[04:01:20] the core tries to use various tests to make sure we're selecting for the right people that can
[04:01:27] do all those things so once you get selected and then it's time to start the training and
[04:01:37] give me give us like an overview of the training what's the pipeline start off with what's like
[04:01:42] the hardest parts and then where does it where does it feel like you kind of level off and you're feeling
[04:01:47] good about it you know every day is different it's I explain it like being in grad school which is
[04:01:54] a more physical component to it I mean there's certain checks in the boxes you need to do like
[04:02:00] you need to get to certain proficiency in speaking Russian and learning to fly the jet if you're
[04:02:06] a pilot flying front seat I'm not a formal military pilot so I had to learn how to be a
[04:02:15] to be an appropriate crew member an effective crew member we are
[04:02:18] serving with a pilot and learning to fly the jet appropriately and work together to complete that
[04:02:25] mission you're learning engineering about the suit the space suit you're in or the
[04:02:30] international space station learning all the different components that heating the cooling
[04:02:34] the electrical components how it recycles water how it recycles urine
[04:02:41] then learning how to operate in the space suit we have this huge pool that has a one-to-one scale of
[04:02:47] the space station in Houston and learning because we don't have in a way to emulate zero gravity on
[04:02:53] our thought obviously but we have buoyancy and we can make neutral buoyancy to emulate what it's
[04:03:01] like to be in a zero or microgravity environment and how it feels to work in a pressurized suit
[04:03:08] to move along and replace batteries work working drills on the space station and I can you learn
[04:03:15] geology we go on trips to learn about various aspects of rock formations how they form why they form
[04:03:21] what's important because this is all relevant we go to Mars we go to the moon we may not be
[04:03:26] able to bring the subject matter experts we don't need to be the subject matter experts we need to
[04:03:30] know in understand we need to have a foundation so that we can go out make effective use of the time
[04:03:36] we have to get the rocks that subject matter experts at home do think is useful so that we can learn
[04:03:43] more about the moon about the Mars and bring that knowledge back to Earth to benefit humanity
[04:03:51] so every day is different does everybody on the team well do you get assigned to like a
[04:03:59] opportunity or a team or are you assigned to a certain group of people that you're going to go on
[04:04:04] a mission together eventually you do in your career when you first show up you're what's called an
[04:04:09] ask can ask a lot candidate so you go through and you you almost do everything together
[04:04:18] did you graduate already from ask can school I did yeah and that was the that was the big
[04:04:23] graduation to replace in January January yes you so once that when you're going through that school
[04:04:30] is that the initial like okay you're learning Russian okay now you're learning about the space
[04:04:34] you're okay now you're working in a weightless environment yep you're learning it's kind of like
[04:04:38] SKT you're learning the basics of what it's like to be an effective astronaut but that training
[04:04:44] never goes away like just like being a seal you don't stop shooting just because you made it
[04:04:47] through SKT it's just the beginning of your of your learning of your professional development and
[04:04:55] you're maintaining all of that so you continue all of those activities maintain speaking your
[04:05:01] Russian practicing in the space you'd flying in a jet you know weekly and then supporting on
[04:05:07] going mission so if you're not assigned which I am not assigned I mean there's a pool of
[04:05:14] astronaut that are always supporting on going missions because that's a priority is supporting on
[04:05:18] going missions and right now we have astronauts that have man the international space station for
[04:05:24] 20 years continuously there are people adult where we have been orbiting in man presence in the
[04:05:34] space station one of the people have been alive and we are looking to go back to the moon in 2024
[04:05:42] with our eyes set for deeper exploration two Mars in beyond but it starts off with goodning
[04:05:48] back to the moon and sitting and deploying a sustained presence so our jobs right now if you're not
[04:05:58] assigned to support those ongoing missions in various capacities and later down the road if you are assigned
[04:06:06] then you are depending on the mission you are working more closely with the other people assigned
[04:06:11] to that mission and that might be like a pro that might be like a workout like you find out
[04:06:16] your assigned to a mission maybe a year or two years before and you're working closely with that
[04:06:21] crew instead of a platoon it's a crew and then you go on a mission and now typically missions are
[04:06:28] kind of like deployments there about six seven months sometimes that are long as times are shorter
[04:06:33] an example of a mission would be going to the space station yes that is right now that is the only
[04:06:40] mission that we have is supporting our space station until 2023 in the NERGNOS science someone that's
[04:06:46] going to go to the moon our team absolutely we're under a program that we have called Artemis
[04:06:51] we will send the first woman in the next man back to the moon and have our sights set with boots
[04:06:59] on the ground on the moon by 2024 and that that hasn't been a sign yet and you said sustained
[04:07:07] presence on the moon sustained while getting to the moon by 2024 at this current time
[04:07:13] is not we are not planning on having sustained presence in 2024 by 2028 we are planning on having
[04:07:19] sustained presence on the moon so having the lunar outpost and learning what it's like to live
[04:07:27] called a planetary haka-cou-boon learning what it's like like having challenges and struggles because
[04:07:35] the space station is 250 miles away it's a four-hour trip if something bad happens on the space
[04:07:41] station it's reassuring knowing that there is a vehicle a Soyuz vehicle which is a Russian vehicle
[04:07:49] waiting there to take our crew members back to Earth if needed the moon is longer it's four-ish
[04:07:57] days to get back Mars that's even longer we're talking about months so it's prudent that we learn
[04:08:06] as much as we can but what it's like to live on a different planetary body like the moon before we
[04:08:13] try and get to Mars and that's what having sustained presence on the moon is all about
[04:08:22] the when when do you think you'll get assigned to a crew is it even noble no and it doesn't
[04:08:32] really matter because you're just going to keep doing your job exactly it's irrelevant I
[04:08:39] I still have and hope that I will continue to have this attitude where I'm just happy to be where I am
[04:08:47] I have an immense opportunity that so many deserving people don't have to work in NASA to be in the
[04:08:54] astronaut core that if I never if I never flew it would still be an honor to serve and who knows
[04:09:02] something medical can she can come up an injury can come up where I may be ineligible to for space flight
[04:09:08] it's not time wasted that's not I would still be very feel very privileged and it'd be a huge
[04:09:15] honor to support on going missions so to me I have I don't know when I'll be assigned and I don't care
[04:09:23] I will be happy with whatever I had the honor of doing and I will fulfill any role to the best
[04:09:29] my ability future is bright well listen Johnny we've actually been going out at for a little over four
[04:09:39] hours right now I know we went through your whole life which is not bad in four hours
[04:09:47] what I know people are going to want to contact you talk to you you know getting touch with you
[04:09:54] I know that you're on social media now big time unfortunately I say my words carefully
[04:10:02] but yeah the well it's pretty awesome that in this day and age you know people can connect with you
[04:10:14] and you know I I was very reluctant to start the social media thing I was actually
[04:10:21] well quite frankly mostly generally life's wife who was like hey idiot you need to get on social
[04:10:29] media so you can connect with people and and sure enough I can't even I can't even begin to tell you the amount of
[04:10:34] incredible conversations feedback suggestions information questions that have that has come through
[04:10:43] social media so even though I know you're probably not super comfortable with it I bet you'll find
[04:10:50] that man it's a great way to communicate with other people to to share things with other people
[04:10:56] to share daily life to explain things to people to help people out I mean I think you're going to
[04:11:02] you're going to end up using it for a positive tool which it at look it can be negative all
[04:11:07] day long and you can sit on there you can find people that just want to just just belittle other
[04:11:14] people and make fun of things and tear the world down it's actually not that hard to avoid those
[04:11:19] people and it's really easy to find people that are are looking to learn share grow help
[04:11:27] the social media is filled with that stuff as well well said I have I had zero internet
[04:11:38] presence and I have potentially not have had any social media accounts before NASA and even for the
[04:11:45] first year and a half at being an NASA just because I have such a visceral feeling with social media
[04:11:52] not because I'm not trying to blame the platform because I think we all as human should take
[04:11:57] accountability for our actions and how we use our tools but narcissism is perhaps one of the biggest
[04:12:04] poisons in our society and narcissism breeds narcissism in a lot of times the way I've seen
[04:12:10] social media used as a platform to promote that and when children see that self promotion that
[04:12:18] self idolization they and then want to be YouTube stars and I'm not saying that that's I'm not
[04:12:27] saying that's a bad thing I think people should pursue their dreams but I think it requires some
[04:12:31] self reflection and thoughtfulness as a society of what we value and when you have narcissism
[04:12:39] as a value trait you were by definition putting yourself above others and I think that is
[04:12:47] not sustainable for a growing and evolving society and that's why I find service very sustainable
[04:12:57] because by definition you are putting others before yourself one of my favorite quotes is from Dr.
[04:13:07] Martin Luther King and it's something along the lines of everyone is capable of greatness
[04:13:13] not fame but greatness because greatness is determined by service and I think sometimes people
[04:13:23] think the definition of success is that everyone in the world knows their name and I think
[04:13:31] they're missing the point when that is the goal they're trying to seek and I sometimes see social
[04:13:37] media used in that but I agree with you that when used responsibly respectfully tactfully thoughtfully
[04:13:46] it can be a platform for good and what made me change my mind about actually having a social
[04:13:55] media and I'm not very active I try to make a post a week a buddy of mine from the team said you
[04:14:02] know look you have an opportunity that most people in this world will never have and people just
[04:14:09] want to share in some of what you do and learn about it and if you are using it responsibly
[04:14:16] not for self promotion but to promote others and to share some of the cool science and inspire
[04:14:23] kids adults then you owe it to do that and that was sent to me still about a year before I
[04:14:33] opened up an application open up a platform but it always stuck with me and I guess that's why
[04:14:43] I have been more okay with with having that because I feel that it can be a force for good
[04:14:50] way to use responsibly well with the longest social media preamble ever Johnny Kim is at Johnny Kim
[04:15:02] USA uh I go you're any questions yeah so how do I become an astronaut hypothetically of course
[04:15:10] I mean you you mentioned the application process like what can you just roll into NASA and be like
[04:15:14] hey I want to work here give you an application or what thank you for asking it to draw them
[04:15:19] happy to share that um if you Google NASA astronaut applications you will find a plethora of links
[04:15:27] that describe our requirements and great detail and just off the top my head you need a college
[04:15:34] degree an undergraduate degree in a STEM field as well as a master's degree in a STEM field that's a
[04:15:41] science technology engineering mathematics medicine does count biosciences counts
[04:15:46] like some degrees like nurse and degree or maybe like a physical education degree don't count
[04:15:54] you can find more details online and you need a couple years of work experience and then
[04:16:00] you meet most of the requirements there you can find out on NASA.gov and applications are open right now
[04:16:08] also I noticed your shirt is that like a special you know I mean can I get a shirt like that or
[04:16:13] oh yeah kind of exclusive no I'm not at all the the NASA the most recognized NASA meet we call the
[04:16:19] meatball logo is owned by NASA but we license it out for free right in one so you can just
[04:16:26] go on a Google shop at your favorite store and find a NASA shirt well if they license it out for free
[04:16:32] there may be Jacob podcast NASA sure that's coming at you any Kim addition is it any Kim addition
[04:16:38] is right on thanks Johnny Kim Johnny I know we've been going out for a while but just any other
[04:16:45] closing thoughts from you I'd just like to say thank you to everyone that's had the grace
[04:16:56] in the patience to tolerate my mistakes along my path and care enough to want me to be a better human being
[04:17:04] to thank my mom for being my first hero and teaching me what it means to be strong
[04:17:16] and most importantly I don't think words can ever give the recognition or explain articulate
[04:17:24] the appreciation I have but thank you to my wife and my kids for supporting me for being
[04:17:37] selfless so that I could pursue my dreams and for loving me awesome awesome I know this was kind of a
[04:17:52] long time coming from the beginning you had to wait till you graduated from astronaut school which
[04:18:00] people thought I was kidding when I said he's got a graduate from astronaut school some people took it
[04:18:06] as me saying I'm not going to have some guy that's not even graduated from astronaut school
[04:18:13] in the podcast he needs to graduate first and I had to go back and explain no I'm just saying you know
[04:18:20] he's under the protocols of NASA and I think it worked out just so that I can speak more
[04:18:27] intelligently about the things that we do in NASA and also like the last thing you want to do
[04:18:32] when he's show up as in due guys somewhere is about like you're an expert at something right
[04:18:37] I mean that's just completely inconsistent with our ethos yeah well I'm glad that we waited
[04:18:46] so glad that you're able to come on and know this is the first interview that you've done
[04:18:49] you probably have a ton more I appreciate you you hold them out because it took us a little time
[04:18:53] to get this coordinated it's an honor for me to have you on here so thanks for coming on and more
[04:18:59] important you know obviously thank you for everything that you did for me for for task
[04:19:06] university or everything you did for the teams everything that you have done and are continuing
[04:19:15] to do for the Navy for NASA and for our great nation it's an honor to know you and thanks for coming
[04:19:24] on man you're welcome and the same goes back to you so thank you for teaching us what it means
[04:19:32] to be a warrior to be a follower a leader to be humble and for caring and loving the men you
[04:19:42] served with long after we've served together it's a relationship I've always been appreciative
[04:19:50] of and I know that at any time I could call you and ask you for help just like I can call any
[04:19:58] number of our teammates and they would drop everything to be there yes indeed brother that's it
[04:20:06] that's what it is thanks for coming on man and with that Johnny Kim has left the building
[04:20:21] not much to say after that one pretty awesome yes and you know a lot of times people they make
[04:20:29] um little comments about Johnny Kim on social media even though he he's not on social media but
[04:20:36] they make comments about him and what they say is something along the lines of
[04:20:43] Navy Zale Harvard Doctor astronaut yes I'm a loser you know everyone feels bad because they
[04:20:54] haven't done as much as Johnny Kim much under achievers bunch of under achievers now look we may not
[04:21:01] be able to become a seal or a doctor or an astronaut right those are some good goals maybe a
[04:21:09] little bit lofty for for an everyday jack like myself that being said maybe we could make some
[04:21:21] goals maybe we could try to become a little bit better in our lives I think that's a I think that's
[04:21:28] a solid thing to do do you agree I agree just like Johnny Kim said on the worry kid podcast because he was
[04:21:36] a guess on there as well giant leaps are done with small steps yeah which is a fitting quote you know
[04:21:45] you guys the whole small step for man giant leap for mankind right so Johnny has confirmed that
[04:21:55] now what I would like to say I think that there are some kind of small steps that we can take in life
[04:22:03] to sort of start moving in the right direction in a powerful direction just what do you think
[04:22:09] well I think among many things we want to stay fit we want to stay capable and strong fit strong
[04:22:17] capable agree that's that's a good bench what do we want to have mental clarity mental clarity yes
[04:22:23] okay good yeah any suggestions on yes those arenas so let's start with your jiu-jitsu we do jiu-jitsu
[04:22:29] yes we do yes sir we can't not do jiu-jitsu it's hard not to jiu-jitsu look you can not do jiu-jitsu
[04:22:38] but you're much better off in every spectrum of your life if you do do jiu-jitsu yes sir so let's do
[04:22:45] jiu-jitsu yeah so well you got to see in the game right you're doing ghee you're doing no ghee
[04:22:50] great both best when you're doing ghee you get an origin ghee that's the kind of ghee you get
[04:22:55] no one asked me that anymore I'm glad that means like we know the words out the word is out so we're
[04:23:01] going to maintain that word origin ghee factually factually the best ghee's happened to be made in America
[04:23:08] you know some people have thrown that as being kind of like one of your words that you use what factually
[04:23:15] cool yeah i mean i'm gonna say factually you do use that word like a thing
[04:23:19] it's actually two we act well nonetheless yes origin main dot com is where you can get your ghee
[04:23:27] for that's you jiu-jitsu you're gonna do no ghee there's rash cards on there as well for also for
[04:23:33] that's you jiu-jitsu also for that's you jiu-jitsu or other things you know also if you're not
[04:23:38] doing jiu-jitsu you're taking a break you know or you're doing some social distancing or something like this
[04:23:44] you know whatever the case may be no worries we got some other stuff on there to wear is what
[04:23:50] government wise garment wise yes body covering items sure yeah as it were uh jeans
[04:23:58] to be more specific so two two uh what uh models de calm models yeah i think so yeah
[04:24:05] things models yeah the regular call regular they're called the factory jeans factually jeans
[04:24:12] and i guess you would truly classify them as medium weight okay they're kind of like normal they're
[04:24:18] normal yeah just normal jeans yes those are called the factory jeans people have been asked me
[04:24:22] what the difference because the other model is called the other model is simply called delta 68
[04:24:29] so the delta 68 jeans which are named in honor of my four fathers in Vietnam that fought in the
[04:24:40] May Kong delta and at some point said you know what our normal fittygs aren't strong enough
[04:24:47] for combat and they went to good old fashioned blue jeans and so in their honor we have a little
[04:24:55] some called the delta 68 jeans and so they're a little lighter weight because they're for the
[04:25:01] jungle by the way but they are flexible because we didn't just we didn't go to a lullsco
[04:25:07] yeah because in honor of team guys guess what team guys adapt and adjust and make things better so we
[04:25:14] took the original blue jeans kept the spirit kept the strength kept the good components but made them
[04:25:21] better you got a little something called flexible so there's your delta 68 jeans oh sorry
[04:25:30] there's your delta 68 jeans very flexible adaptable oh that's the functional for sure really
[04:25:40] yes 100% you don't need to add another word to that no but I will add the word comfort not
[04:25:46] in application to delta 68 jeans these are the joggers the sweat suits and other uh leisure or active
[04:25:53] wear but we're not selling any leisure wear period and the story stop okay okay I dig it but when I'm exercising
[04:26:01] my leisure we're engaging in my leisure activities I'm gonna have the joggers or maybe when I'm
[04:26:08] jogging whichever you see I'm saying it's leisure and active it's what I'm saying

[04:32:17] for that soap and that is to help you stay clean great action myself and he's three by the way
[04:32:27] he likes a killer soap it's black to say it's not abrasive it but it has the little like
[04:32:32] slight scrubbing quality in there's a slight scrubbing that's something yes would it be
[04:32:37] would it be considered exfoliating no I don't know the criteria I don't think so but it does I know
[04:32:43] your talking it has a little bit yeah a little not much not a little bit make you feel cleaner
[04:32:50] 100% there you go yeah plus it's black by the way did I mention that yeah it looks kind of dope
[04:32:56] the fact that you use something that is black that you'd think oh this is gonna make everything dirty
[04:33:02] but it actually makes you clean is is like you're working with a handheld miracle
[04:33:07] it's a modern medical medical medical it's that activated charcoal yeah I seen a
[04:33:14] I don't know what it was like an Instagram video or something like this where activated
[04:33:18] charcoal they're using it like in something to brush their teeth so I was like hey I don't know
[04:33:23] what all that but apparently you know yeah we used to use it to prevent us from being killed by
[04:33:29] chemical biological and radiological weapons activated charcoal so why not wash your body with it
[04:33:35] there you go seems like good idea to me so there you go seems to work also we do have a YouTube channel
[04:33:42] with a video version of this podcast we want to see what Johnny Kim looks like
[04:33:47] see how young he looks you know it's watch YouTube video of it I think the YouTube is starting to
[04:33:54] become kind of like a more popular way of watching the podcast or well should I say uh
[04:34:00] what do you call listening to it or whatever well if you're on YouTube then you are in back watching it
[04:34:04] yeah I guess maybe you could be like have it on the in the background yeah like in the big
[04:34:08] screen or you know help you you know smart TVs nowadays that's the that's the jam nowadays
[04:34:13] you can have it on that whatever the last we do have YouTube channel official verified all that
[04:34:18] stuff so that's how you can tell it's a real one because there's you know people that'll
[04:34:21] cut they'll chop up little chunks and they'll put it on their YouTube channels everyone's in a while

[04:34:30] on there as well enhanced excerpts with fire and smoke and explosions everyone's in a while yeah
[04:34:35] because what is what good is a good is a you know the spoken word if nothing's blowing up
[04:34:43] they know that's true it's all I feel sometimes true I didn't know if you were going to make it
[04:34:47] through today I fought for a moment you're going to make it through today without bringing in some random
[04:34:51] sci-fi movie episode the one time you spoke up you went straight to just Armageddon movie
[04:34:58] bro I was about to bust out interstellar Armageddon a deep impact like this a bunch of
[04:35:03] I was super nervous coming in this podcast because of that I'm like this could be hard I don't know
[04:35:09] if he's gonna be able to contain himself this could just turn into a sci-fi movie discussion and he
[04:35:13] mentioned Mars where that's the next mission so bro Mars what are we doing up there we all
[04:35:19] applaud you for containing your emotions and not turning this into a sci-fi movie discussion

[04:38:20] that juggle willing again thanks once again to Johnny Kim for coming on thanks for NASA
[04:38:25] for letting him come out and do this and thanks to him for being such a humble guy and setting such a great
[04:38:31] example such a great example for everyone listen to what he's overcome what he's done what he's
[04:38:39] doing and what he has done not only in his personal life but what he has done in the service
[04:38:46] of his country and in the service of his friends and his brothers and the same goes to the rest of
[04:38:54] our service men and women out there on sea air land and in space preserving freedom
[04:39:05] and protecting our way of life in this world and beyond and to police and law enforcement
[04:39:15] and fire fighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correction officers and border patrol
[04:39:19] and secret service thanks to what you all do every day as well and the sacrifices you make
[04:39:26] to protect us here at home and everyone else out there there are so many things that you can do
[04:39:38] so many things that you can do and as Johnny Kim proves you can be humble and you can be helpful
[04:39:45] as you do those things and in fact the more humble you are the more help for you are
[04:39:54] the better you will do and that being said humility is no guarantee for success
[04:40:02] because while yes you have to be humble yes still have to set some serious goals
[04:40:08] then you have to work harder than you think is possible and no matter where you came from
[04:40:18] and no matter what's ahead of you and no matter what happens keep getting after it
