00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.48
This is Jockel Podcast number 60.

2
00:00:04.48 --> 00:00:08.08
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:09.76
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:09.76 --> 00:00:15.16
Good evening.

5
00:00:15.16 --> 00:00:21.48
What I am about to relate is anything but a pleasant story.

6
00:00:21.48 --> 00:00:27.96
In fact, it is so very unpleasant that I cannot recommend anyone without a strong stomach

7
00:00:27.96 --> 00:00:30.56
to read it.

8
00:00:30.56 --> 00:00:37.68
For it is a story of such crime and horror as to almost be unbelievable.

9
00:00:37.68 --> 00:00:45.54
The story of depredations of a horde of degraded criminals of incredible beastiality on a

10
00:00:45.54 --> 00:00:51.40
peaceful, kindly law-abiding people.

11
00:00:51.40 --> 00:00:59.56
I believe it has no parallel in modern history.

12
00:00:59.56 --> 00:01:08.44
And that is a warning that was written by a man by the name of George Fitch, who was an

13
00:01:08.44 --> 00:01:13.76
American in the city of Nanking, China.

14
00:01:13.76 --> 00:01:24.68
He was working for the YMCA in 1937 when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded.

15
00:01:24.68 --> 00:01:29.92
I am going to tell you that that warning is not strong enough.

16
00:01:29.92 --> 00:01:37.20
I know that many of you listen to this podcast with your children.

17
00:01:37.20 --> 00:01:47.12
And I am going to tell you right now, this podcast, this episode is not for children.

18
00:01:47.12 --> 00:01:54.44
This episode is barely even for adults.

19
00:01:54.44 --> 00:02:01.44
And I am sure that some of you will not make it through this podcast.

20
00:02:01.44 --> 00:02:07.16
I almost decided not to do it.

21
00:02:07.16 --> 00:02:17.52
This podcast, this episode is going to review a book called The Raper of Nanking by an author

22
00:02:17.52 --> 00:02:20.72
by the name of Iris Chang.

23
00:02:20.72 --> 00:02:31.24
And part of the reason that I decided that I had to cover this book is because of the

24
00:02:31.24 --> 00:02:36.72
story that follows the story.

25
00:02:36.72 --> 00:02:46.68
And that is of Iris Chang, the author, a bright, beautiful, intelligent, successful

26
00:02:46.68 --> 00:02:56.04
and loving woman who was consumed by darkness.

27
00:02:56.04 --> 00:03:04.68
And I will discuss her fate in a book that was written by her mother, Ying Ying Chang,

28
00:03:04.68 --> 00:03:11.12
in a book called The Woman Who Could Not Forget.

29
00:03:11.12 --> 00:03:21.92
And what happened in the city of Nanking is it is beyond darkness.

30
00:03:21.92 --> 00:03:26.56
It is beyond evil.

31
00:03:26.56 --> 00:03:38.04
It is pure savagery, wanton savagery of the highest order.

32
00:03:38.04 --> 00:03:46.80
And part of me thinks maybe it's best if it is forgotten.

33
00:03:46.80 --> 00:03:51.88
Maybe that's the best way to prevent it from happening again.

34
00:03:51.88 --> 00:03:58.32
But part of me knows that that is wrong.

35
00:03:58.32 --> 00:04:12.04
And the only way to learn is to study and to understand and to try and banish this from

36
00:04:12.04 --> 00:04:19.92
our memories to me that leaves a door.

37
00:04:19.92 --> 00:04:30.04
Leave a door open for something like this to happen again, somewhere, sometime.

38
00:04:30.04 --> 00:04:37.72
But I want to warn you again that there are parts of this episode that are extremely

39
00:04:37.72 --> 00:04:41.96
graphic.

40
00:04:41.96 --> 00:04:48.16
And I didn't put it all in there, but I absolutely wanted people to understand that this

41
00:04:48.16 --> 00:04:49.56
is what happened.

42
00:04:49.56 --> 00:05:00.80
And I feel compelled to discuss it for one for Iris Chang who in my mind sacrificed everything

43
00:05:00.80 --> 00:05:10.72
to tell the story to help ensure that those who suffered all remembered.

44
00:05:10.72 --> 00:05:21.64
And also to ensure that the human race at large has the knowledge, has the warning that

45
00:05:21.64 --> 00:05:26.08
evil exists.

46
00:05:26.08 --> 00:05:36.08
And that mankind is capable of becoming engulfed in that evil.

47
00:05:36.08 --> 00:06:05.68
And that man can act without mercy or remorse or the slightest shred of humanity at all.

48
00:06:05.68 --> 00:06:08.88
Go into the book.

49
00:06:08.88 --> 00:06:14.84
To prepare for the inevitable war with China, Japan had spent decades training its men

50
00:06:14.84 --> 00:06:16.56
for combat.

51
00:06:16.56 --> 00:06:21.60
The molding of young men deserve in the Japanese military began early in life.

52
00:06:21.60 --> 00:06:28.000
And in the 1930s the Marshall Influenced Seept into every aspect of Japanese boyhood.

53
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.04
Toy shops became virtual shrines to war, selling arsenals of toy soldiers, tanks, helmets,

54
00:06:35.04 --> 00:06:41.20
uniforms, rifles, anti-aircraft guns, bugles, and hawardsers.

55
00:06:41.20 --> 00:06:48.48
Memoirs from that time describe preadolescent boys waging mock battles in the streets,

56
00:06:48.48 --> 00:06:52.60
using bamboo poles as imaginary rifles.

57
00:06:52.60 --> 00:07:00.52
Some even tied logs of wood on their back and fantasized about dying as human bomb heroes

58
00:07:00.52 --> 00:07:04.52
in suicide missions.

59
00:07:04.52 --> 00:07:08.96
And I can tell you, I grew up doing all that stuff.

60
00:07:08.96 --> 00:07:12.16
We played war all the time.

61
00:07:12.16 --> 00:07:13.16
All the time.

62
00:07:13.16 --> 00:07:19.04
So I don't find anything shocking about that.

63
00:07:19.04 --> 00:07:23.40
Back to the book, Japanese schools operated like miniature military units.

64
00:07:23.40 --> 00:07:28.92
Indeed, some of the teachers were military officers who lectured students on their duty

65
00:07:28.92 --> 00:07:35.32
to help Japan fulfill its divine destiny of conquering Asia and being able to stand up

66
00:07:35.32 --> 00:07:39.96
to the world's nations as a people second to none.

67
00:07:39.96 --> 00:07:45.000
Now we're starting to get off course.

68
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.88
They taught young boys how to handle wooden models of guns and older boys how to handle

69
00:07:49.88 --> 00:07:51.68
real ones.

70
00:07:51.68 --> 00:07:55.52
Textbooks became vehicles from military propaganda.

71
00:07:55.52 --> 00:08:01.52
In geography book even used the shape of Japan as justification for expansion.

72
00:08:01.52 --> 00:08:07.16
We appear to be standing in the vanguard of Asia, advancing bravely into the Pacific.

73
00:08:07.16 --> 00:08:14.64
At the same time we appear ready to defend the Asian continent from outside attack.

74
00:08:14.64 --> 00:08:20.88
Teachers also instilled in boys hatred and contempt for the Chinese people, preparing them

75
00:08:20.88 --> 00:08:26.36
psychologically for a future invasion of the Chinese mainland.

76
00:08:26.36 --> 00:08:31.12
One historian tells the story of a squamous Japanese schoolboy in the 1930s who burst into

77
00:08:31.12 --> 00:08:34.08
tears when told the dissected a frog.

78
00:08:34.08 --> 00:08:38.24
His teacher slammed his knuckles against the boys head and yelled, why are you crying about

79
00:08:38.24 --> 00:08:39.80
one lousy frog?

80
00:08:39.80 --> 00:08:49.48
When you grow up you'll have to kill 100-200 chinks.

81
00:08:49.48 --> 00:08:54.32
Japanese minister of education declared that schools were run not for the benefit of the

82
00:08:54.32 --> 00:08:58.72
students but for the good of the country.

83
00:08:58.72 --> 00:09:03.28
Elementary school teachers were trained like military crutes with student teachers housed

84
00:09:03.28 --> 00:09:07.44
in barracks and subject to harsh discipline and indoctrination.

85
00:09:07.44 --> 00:09:12.20
In 1890 the imperial rescript on education emerged.

86
00:09:12.20 --> 00:09:18.04
It laid down a code of ethics to govern not only students and teachers but every Japanese

87
00:09:18.04 --> 00:09:19.88
citizen.

88
00:09:19.88 --> 00:09:27.40
The rescript was the civilian equivalent of Japanese military codes which valued above all

89
00:09:27.40 --> 00:09:35.000
obedience to authority and unconditional loyalty to the emperor.

90
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.12
In every Japanese school copy of the rescript was enshrined with a portrait of the emperor

91
00:09:40.12 --> 00:09:43.44
and taken out each morning to be read.

92
00:09:43.44 --> 00:09:48.84
It was reputed that more than one teacher who accidentally stumbled over the words committed

93
00:09:48.84 --> 00:09:54.16
suicide to a tone for the insult to the sacred document.

94
00:09:54.16 --> 00:09:58.000
So we've got a that's 1890 by the way, 1890.

95
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.04
So this is generations now that this is being plugged into the students' brains.

96
00:10:06.04 --> 00:10:13.000
And these things, when we talk about students, we talk about children.

97
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:22.68
We teach them generally freedom is the ultimate goal, freedom is the ultimate.

98
00:10:22.68 --> 00:10:28.60
The ultimate thing to strive for.

99
00:10:28.60 --> 00:10:32.28
The ultimate thing to defend is freedom.

100
00:10:32.28 --> 00:10:38.36
And here they're getting taught that the ultimate thing was obedience to authority and unconditional

101
00:10:38.36 --> 00:10:42.60
loyalty.

102
00:10:42.60 --> 00:10:46.52
Back to the book, it was commonplace for teachers to behave like sadistic drills start

103
00:10:46.52 --> 00:10:50.08
and slapping children across the cheeks, hitting them with their fists or bludgeoning

104
00:10:50.08 --> 00:10:53.40
them with bamboo or wooden swords.

105
00:10:53.40 --> 00:10:58.60
Students were forced to hold heavy objects, sit on their knees, stand barefoot in the snow

106
00:10:58.60 --> 00:11:02.80
or run around the playground until they collapse from exhaustion.

107
00:11:02.80 --> 00:11:08.96
There were certainly few visits to the schools by indignant or even concerned parents.

108
00:11:08.96 --> 00:11:15.20
The pressure to conform to authority intensified if the school boy decided to become a soldier.

109
00:11:15.20 --> 00:11:21.92
Vicious hazing and relentless pecking order usually squelched any residual spirit of individualism

110
00:11:21.92 --> 00:11:23.76
within him.

111
00:11:23.76 --> 00:11:28.36
Obedience was touted as a supreme virtue.

112
00:11:28.36 --> 00:11:33.68
And a sense of individual self-worth was replaced by a sense of value as a small cog in

113
00:11:33.68 --> 00:11:36.84
the larger scheme of things.

114
00:11:36.84 --> 00:11:42.24
We established this sublimation of individuality to the common good, superior officers

115
00:11:42.24 --> 00:11:47.20
of older soldiers slapped recruits for almost no reason at all or beat them severely with

116
00:11:47.20 --> 00:11:50.56
heaven and wooden rods.

117
00:11:50.56 --> 00:11:57.08
According to the author Toshio, officers often justified unauthorized punishment saying,

118
00:11:57.08 --> 00:11:59.32
I do not beat you because I hate you.

119
00:11:59.32 --> 00:12:01.92
I beat you because I care for you.

120
00:12:01.92 --> 00:12:07.68
Do you think I perform these acts with hands swollen and bloody in a state of madness?

121
00:12:07.68 --> 00:12:13.80
Some youths died under such brutal physical conditions, others committed suicide.

122
00:12:13.80 --> 00:12:19.16
The majority became tempered vessels into which the military could pour a new set of life

123
00:12:19.16 --> 00:12:23.12
goals.

124
00:12:23.12 --> 00:12:30.08
So this is complete, you know, militant raising of children and what I want to note here

125
00:12:30.08 --> 00:12:34.40
is anybody that thinks, you know what, that probably produced some incredible warriors.

126
00:12:34.40 --> 00:12:36.76
You're actually wrong.

127
00:12:36.76 --> 00:12:37.76
Did it reduce warriors?

128
00:12:37.76 --> 00:12:38.76
Yes, it did.

129
00:12:38.76 --> 00:12:49.28
But let's remember that these warriors that were raised in this manner, when they had American

130
00:12:49.28 --> 00:12:56.84
soldiers and marines that had to face them when they were incredibly well dug in defensive

131
00:12:56.84 --> 00:13:03.000
positions and the Americans had to take beach fronts and beach heads, the free thinking

132
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:11.96
American soldier proved to be the better.

133
00:13:11.96 --> 00:13:17.28
Back to the book, training was no less grueling a process for aspiring officers.

134
00:13:17.28 --> 00:13:25.08
Above all, the Japanese cadets were to adopt a will which knows no defeat.

135
00:13:25.08 --> 00:13:30.12
So terrified were the cadets of any hint of failure that examination results were kept secret

136
00:13:30.12 --> 00:13:35.16
to minimize the risk of suicide.

137
00:13:35.16 --> 00:13:40.68
So that's what again, this is going all the way back to 1890, so we've got 40, 50 years

138
00:13:40.68 --> 00:13:48.32
worth before we get into this, where this massacre takes place.

139
00:13:48.32 --> 00:13:52.80
Back to the book, in the summer of 1937, Japan finally succeeded in provoking a full-scale

140
00:13:52.80 --> 00:13:54.56
war with China.

141
00:13:54.56 --> 00:13:57.92
So Japan was now engaging in a war with China.

142
00:13:57.92 --> 00:14:04.44
They went to Shanghai, the Japanese invaded Shanghai, big giant city, and they thought

143
00:14:04.44 --> 00:14:06.92
they were going to have no factor, right?

144
00:14:06.92 --> 00:14:11.32
Because they're getting told all the time that they're the best, and they're the supreme

145
00:14:11.32 --> 00:14:13.12
warriors and all this.

146
00:14:13.12 --> 00:14:17.76
Well going back to the book here, Japanese military leaders had boasted and seriously

147
00:14:17.76 --> 00:14:22.64
believed that Japan could conquer all of mainland China within three months.

148
00:14:22.64 --> 00:14:28.76
We got some arrogance going on here, but when a battle in a single Chinese city alone that

149
00:14:28.76 --> 00:14:33.52
was Shanghai dragged from summer to fall and then from fall to winter, it shattered

150
00:14:33.52 --> 00:14:36.88
Japanese fantasies of an easy victory.

151
00:14:36.88 --> 00:14:42.64
Here, this primitive people, in literary, in military science and poorly trained, had managed

152
00:14:42.64 --> 00:14:46.48
to fight the superior Japanese to a standstill.

153
00:14:46.48 --> 00:14:53.44
And Shanghai finally fell in November the mood of the imperial troops had turned ugly.

154
00:14:53.44 --> 00:15:04.08
And many say, and many it was said, lusted for revenge as they marched towards Nanking.

155
00:15:04.08 --> 00:15:05.32
So they're on route now.

156
00:15:05.32 --> 00:15:08.16
They had a hard time taking down Shanghai.

157
00:15:08.16 --> 00:15:12.24
They got vengeance on their mind when they're going into the city of Nanking.

158
00:15:12.24 --> 00:15:13.24
Back to the book.

159
00:15:13.24 --> 00:15:15.76
Little was spared on the path to Nanking.

160
00:15:15.76 --> 00:15:20.68
Japanese veterans remember raiding tiny farm communities where they clubbed or bayoneted

161
00:15:20.68 --> 00:15:23.08
everyone in sight.

162
00:15:23.08 --> 00:15:26.72
But small villages were not the only casualties.

163
00:15:26.72 --> 00:15:30.16
Entire cities were raised to the ground.

164
00:15:30.16 --> 00:15:37.36
Consider the example of Su Chau, a city on the east bank of Tai Hu Lake.

165
00:15:37.36 --> 00:15:41.80
One of the oldest cities in China, it was prized for its delicate silk embroidery palaces

166
00:15:41.80 --> 00:15:44.08
and temple temples.

167
00:15:44.08 --> 00:15:48.88
This canals and ancient bridges had earned its earned the city, its western nickname

168
00:15:48.88 --> 00:15:51.20
as the Venice of China.

169
00:15:51.20 --> 00:15:57.48
On November 19th, on a morning of pouring rain, a Japanese advanced guard marched

170
00:15:57.48 --> 00:16:02.64
to the gates of Su Chau wearing hoods that prevented the Chinese centuries from recognizing

171
00:16:02.64 --> 00:16:03.64
them.

172
00:16:03.64 --> 00:16:09.000
Once inside, the Japanese murdered and plundered the city for days, burning down ancient

173
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.76
landmarks and abducting thousands of Chinese women for sexual slavery.

174
00:16:14.76 --> 00:16:19.56
The invasion, according to the China Weekly Review, caused a population of the city to

175
00:16:19.56 --> 00:16:30.44
drop from 350,000 to less than 500.

176
00:16:30.44 --> 00:16:32.76
But the worst was still to come.

177
00:16:32.76 --> 00:16:40.04
Now there was a general that was sort of in charge of the Japanese that were heading to

178
00:16:40.04 --> 00:16:41.04
to Nanking.

179
00:16:41.04 --> 00:16:43.88
His name was General Matsui.

180
00:16:43.88 --> 00:16:56.16
He seemed to have some semblance of honor to him and gave some pretty good, I would say,

181
00:16:56.16 --> 00:17:01.16
benevolent type as benevolent as you can be when you're going into war of orders.

182
00:17:01.16 --> 00:17:05.20
So here's one of the things that he proclaimed, the back to the book, the entry of the

183
00:17:05.20 --> 00:17:09.80
Imperial Army into a foreign capital is a great event in our history, attracting the attention

184
00:17:09.80 --> 00:17:11.24
of the world.

185
00:17:11.24 --> 00:17:15.68
Therefore let no unit enter the city in a disorderly fashion.

186
00:17:15.68 --> 00:17:19.28
Let them know beforehand the matters to be remembered in the position of foreign rights

187
00:17:19.28 --> 00:17:22.12
and interests in the walled city.

188
00:17:22.12 --> 00:17:27.28
Let them be absolutely free from plunder.

189
00:17:27.28 --> 00:17:31.12
He's given some pretty, like I said, about his benevolent

190
00:17:31.12 --> 00:17:34.16
orders as you could give, that was Matsui.

191
00:17:34.16 --> 00:17:41.16
Well, unfortunately Matsui gets sick and he can't be the leader.

192
00:17:41.16 --> 00:17:44.72
Although he kind of goes in and out of a leadership position as this is going on, there's

193
00:17:44.72 --> 00:17:50.48
a new guy that comes in and the new guy that comes in is his actual royalty named Prince

194
00:17:50.48 --> 00:17:53.80
Asaka.

195
00:17:53.80 --> 00:17:57.08
Now Prince Asaka gets word.

196
00:17:57.08 --> 00:18:01.000
He starts to get to understand the situation that they're going into and he gets told that

197
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.88
they're going to be when they take Nanking, they're going to have about 300,000 Chinese

198
00:18:06.88 --> 00:18:10.04
troops to deal with.

199
00:18:10.04 --> 00:18:17.08
And they get some preliminary word that it sounds like the Chinese are ready to surrender.

200
00:18:17.08 --> 00:18:18.52
They kind of hear that intelligence.

201
00:18:18.52 --> 00:18:20.68
They have spies in there and whatnot.

202
00:18:20.68 --> 00:18:24.68
Back to the book, after Asaka heard this report, it was said that his headquarters sent

203
00:18:24.68 --> 00:18:31.32
out a set of orders under his personal seal marked Secret to be destroyed.

204
00:18:31.32 --> 00:18:36.88
We now know that the message of these orders was clear.

205
00:18:36.88 --> 00:18:41.32
Kill all captives.

206
00:18:41.32 --> 00:18:46.40
And they actually do have a copy of an order that came out.

207
00:18:46.40 --> 00:18:51.88
And this was on December 13, 1937, the Japanese 66 battalion received the following command.

208
00:18:51.88 --> 00:18:55.000
I'm not going to read the whole thing, but here's parts of it.

209
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.48
Battalion battle reporter at zero to zero zero received order from the Regiment Commander

210
00:19:01.48 --> 00:19:06.24
to comply with orders from the brigade commanding headquarters, all prisoners of war are

211
00:19:06.24 --> 00:19:07.96
to be executed.

212
00:19:07.96 --> 00:19:13.88
Method of execution divide the prisoners into group of a dozen, shoot to kill separately.

213
00:19:13.88 --> 00:19:19.80
Goes on to give some details about who's supposed to run this and then it continues back

214
00:19:19.80 --> 00:19:24.84
to the book, the vicinity of the imprisonment must be heavily guarded.

215
00:19:24.84 --> 00:19:30.68
Our intentions are absolutely not to be detected by the prisoners.

216
00:19:30.68 --> 00:19:37.52
Every company is to complete preparation before zero 500 executions are to start promptly

217
00:19:37.52 --> 00:19:44.16
by that time and action is to be finished by 730.

218
00:19:44.16 --> 00:19:45.56
So there you go.

219
00:19:45.56 --> 00:19:46.56
Straight up orders.

220
00:19:46.56 --> 00:19:49.60
They're going to kill everyone.

221
00:19:49.60 --> 00:19:52.16
It's very important to note here.

222
00:19:52.16 --> 00:19:55.68
These are intentions are absolutely not to be detected.

223
00:19:55.68 --> 00:20:00.68
So they were going to make it very clandestine and keep the Chinese from knowing that they

224
00:20:00.68 --> 00:20:03.32
were going to kill them all.

225
00:20:03.32 --> 00:20:06.52
Back to the book, there was a ruthless logic to the order.

226
00:20:06.52 --> 00:20:10.84
The captives could not be fed so they had to be destroyed.

227
00:20:10.84 --> 00:20:16.72
Killing them would not only eliminate the food problem, but diminish the possibility of retaliation.

228
00:20:16.72 --> 00:20:24.16
Moreover, dead enemies could not form up into guerilla forces.

229
00:20:24.16 --> 00:20:26.08
So they have their orders.

230
00:20:26.08 --> 00:20:29.36
They go in and begin the operation.

231
00:20:29.36 --> 00:20:30.36
Here we go.

232
00:20:30.36 --> 00:20:31.36
Back to the book.

233
00:20:31.36 --> 00:20:36.36
All this was easier to achieve than the Japanese had anticipated.

234
00:20:36.36 --> 00:20:37.96
Resistance was sporadic.

235
00:20:37.96 --> 00:20:41.84
Indeed, it was practically non-existent.

236
00:20:41.84 --> 00:20:46.20
Having thrown away their arms when attempting to flee the city as the Japanese closed

237
00:20:46.20 --> 00:20:52.36
in, many Chinese soldiers simply turned themselves in, hoping for better treatment.

238
00:20:52.36 --> 00:21:03.08
Once the men surrendered and permitted their hands to be bound, the rest was easy.

239
00:21:03.08 --> 00:21:11.04
So the Chinese give up their weapons and allow themselves to be taken.

240
00:21:11.04 --> 00:21:14.84
Not a good idea.

241
00:21:14.84 --> 00:21:24.96
Now we're going to go to a quote from a Japanese soldier named Azuma.

242
00:21:24.96 --> 00:21:31.28
It was funny yet pitiful when I imagined how they gathered whatever white cloth they could

243
00:21:31.28 --> 00:21:37.32
find attached it to a dead twig and marched forward just to surrender.

244
00:21:37.32 --> 00:21:42.16
I thought how could they become prisoners with the kind of force that they had more than

245
00:21:42.16 --> 00:21:47.44
two battalions and even without trying to show any resistance.

246
00:21:47.44 --> 00:21:51.52
There must have been a considerable number of officers for this many troops but not a single

247
00:21:51.52 --> 00:21:53.20
one remained.

248
00:21:53.20 --> 00:21:57.04
All of them having slipped away and escaped, I thought.

249
00:21:57.04 --> 00:22:02.56
Although we had two companies and those 7,000 prisoners had already been disarmed, our troops

250
00:22:02.56 --> 00:22:07.64
could have been annihilated, had they decided to rise up and revolt.

251
00:22:07.64 --> 00:22:17.24
I didn't go through too much of this but it was a chaotic scene when the Chinese realized

252
00:22:17.24 --> 00:22:21.56
what was going to happen and as that indicated a lot of the senior leadership, they fled

253
00:22:21.56 --> 00:22:23.80
the city and left the soldiers there.

254
00:22:23.80 --> 00:22:26.92
Now with no leadership and what are they going to do?

255
00:22:26.92 --> 00:22:32.24
The Japanese did psychological warfare on them and dropped leaflets that said, hey if you surrender

256
00:22:32.24 --> 00:22:35.96
you'll be treated well, we have rice for you and that's what they did.

257
00:22:35.96 --> 00:22:42.52
They lied, of course.

258
00:22:42.52 --> 00:22:47.12
Back to the book, when the Japanese military received orders on December 17 to kill prisoners

259
00:22:47.12 --> 00:22:49.72
they proceeded with extra caution.

260
00:22:49.72 --> 00:22:53.40
That morning the Japanese announced that they were going to transport the Chinese prisoners

261
00:22:53.40 --> 00:22:56.84
to a small island in the middle of the Yanzi River.

262
00:22:56.84 --> 00:23:01.64
They explained to the captives that they needed to take special precautions to move for

263
00:23:01.64 --> 00:23:04.96
the move and bound the captives hands behind their backs.

264
00:23:04.96 --> 00:23:09.68
The tasks that took all morning and most of the afternoon.

265
00:23:09.68 --> 00:23:16.04
Sometime between 4 and 6 p.m., the Japanese divided the prisoners into 4 columns and marched

266
00:23:16.04 --> 00:23:21.60
them to the west, skirting the hills and stopping at the riverbank.

267
00:23:21.60 --> 00:23:25.64
After three or four hours of waiting and not knowing what was going on the prisoners could

268
00:23:25.64 --> 00:23:30.96
not see any preparations for crossing the river.

269
00:23:30.96 --> 00:23:37.000
For corporal route, it was going dark. They did not know that Japanese soldiers already

270
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.68
encircled them in a crescent formation along the river and that they were in sites of

271
00:23:41.68 --> 00:23:44.28
many machine guns.

272
00:23:44.28 --> 00:23:51.32
By the time the executions began it was too late for the Chinese to escape.

273
00:23:51.32 --> 00:23:56.000
Suddenly all kinds of guns fired at once.

274
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.72
Parihah, Richi wrote, the sound of the firearms mingled with the desperate yelling and

275
00:24:02.72 --> 00:24:04.72
screams.

276
00:24:04.72 --> 00:24:10.92
For an hour the Chinese struggled and thrashed about desperately until there were few sounds

277
00:24:10.92 --> 00:24:13.76
coming from the group.

278
00:24:13.76 --> 00:24:24.92
From evening until dawn the Japanese bayoneted the bodies one by one.

279
00:24:24.92 --> 00:24:30.88
And that seemed to place over and over again because what they did is they indicated

280
00:24:30.88 --> 00:24:34.76
and then in that order if you missed it they separated the group.

281
00:24:34.76 --> 00:24:40.000
So they had them captured inside the city and then they took them in small units of 30, 40

282
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.16
Chinese soldiers tied their hands and said, we're going to transport you and they did this

283
00:24:44.16 --> 00:24:48.56
all over the city at the same time coordinated and then took them out to different places

284
00:24:48.56 --> 00:24:53.72
outside the city and killed them.

285
00:24:53.72 --> 00:24:57.88
But it wasn't only the soldiers that they did this to.

286
00:24:57.88 --> 00:25:02.20
Back to the book after the soldiers surrendered on mass there was virtually no one left

287
00:25:02.20 --> 00:25:05.04
to protect the citizens of the city.

288
00:25:05.04 --> 00:25:11.000
Knowing this the Japanese poured into Nanking on December 13th, 1937, occupying government

289
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.44
buildings, banks and warehouses shooting people randomly in the streets many of them

290
00:25:15.44 --> 00:25:18.28
in the back as they ran away.

291
00:25:18.28 --> 00:25:23.40
Using machine guns, revolvers and rifles the Japanese fired at the crowds of wounded

292
00:25:23.40 --> 00:25:30.36
soldiers elderly women and children who gathered in the north and central roads and nearby

293
00:25:30.36 --> 00:25:31.84
alleys.

294
00:25:31.84 --> 00:25:35.68
They also killed Chinese civilians in every section of the city.

295
00:25:35.68 --> 00:25:42.96
Tiny lanes, major boulevard, mud dugouts, government buildings, city squares.

296
00:25:42.96 --> 00:25:48.12
As victims toppled to the ground, moaning and screaming the streets alleys and ditches

297
00:25:48.12 --> 00:25:53.68
of the fallen capital, ran rivers of blood, much of it coming from people barely alive

298
00:25:53.68 --> 00:25:59.48
with no strength left to run away.

299
00:25:59.48 --> 00:26:03.96
The Japanese systematically killed the city dwellers as they conducted house to house

300
00:26:03.96 --> 00:26:08.04
searches for Chinese soldiers in Nanking.

301
00:26:08.04 --> 00:26:12.28
But they also massacred the Chinese and nearby suburbs and countryside.

302
00:26:12.28 --> 00:26:17.88
Corpse is piled up outside the city walls along the river by ponds and lakes and on

303
00:26:17.88 --> 00:26:21.08
hills and mountains.

304
00:26:21.08 --> 00:26:25.92
In villages near Nanking the Japanese shot down any young man who passed under the presumption

305
00:26:25.92 --> 00:26:30.20
that he was likely to be a former Chinese soldier.

306
00:26:30.20 --> 00:26:34.92
But they also murdered people who could not possibly be Chinese soldiers elderly men

307
00:26:34.92 --> 00:26:40.40
and women for instance, if they hesitated or even if they failed to understand orders,

308
00:26:40.40 --> 00:26:43.96
which would deliver the Japanese language.

309
00:26:43.96 --> 00:26:49.20
Obviously, not every Chinese person spoke Japanese.

310
00:26:49.20 --> 00:26:55.92
So this is now just a full-on killing spree.

311
00:26:55.92 --> 00:26:57.84
And I'm going to read a section here.

312
00:26:57.84 --> 00:27:01.64
There was military war correspondence.

313
00:27:01.64 --> 00:27:05.72
That were there from the Japanese military.

314
00:27:05.72 --> 00:27:13.28
And I will read this one is from a military war correspondent named Yukiyo Omata.

315
00:27:13.28 --> 00:27:21.92
And he saw the Chinese prisoners being brought and lined up along the river.

316
00:27:21.92 --> 00:27:28.04
Back to the book, those in the first row were beheaded.

317
00:27:28.04 --> 00:27:32.60
Those in the second row were forced to dump the severed bodies into the river before they

318
00:27:32.60 --> 00:27:35.20
themselves were beheaded.

319
00:27:35.20 --> 00:27:40.04
The killing went on nonstop for mourning until night, but they were only able to kill

320
00:27:40.04 --> 00:27:43.48
2,000 persons in this way.

321
00:27:43.48 --> 00:27:48.64
The next day tired of killing in this fashion, they set up machine guns.

322
00:27:48.64 --> 00:27:54.60
Through them raked across fire at the lined-up prisoners, rat-tatt-tatt.

323
00:27:54.60 --> 00:27:55.96
Triggers were pulled.

324
00:27:55.96 --> 00:28:07.16
The prisoners fled into the water, but no one was able to make it to the other shore.

325
00:28:07.16 --> 00:28:18.32
This systematic murder of everyone is basically what we're dealing with.

326
00:28:18.32 --> 00:28:28.20
And when they got their momentum going on the extermination of most of the men, they turned

327
00:28:28.20 --> 00:28:32.72
their attention to the women.

328
00:28:32.72 --> 00:28:37.56
To the book, women suffered the most.

329
00:28:37.56 --> 00:28:44.08
Taka-Koro-Kozu, a former soldier in the 114th Division of the Japanese Army in Nanking,

330
00:28:44.08 --> 00:28:46.32
recalled.

331
00:28:46.32 --> 00:28:54.40
No matter how young or old they all could not escape the fate of being raped.

332
00:28:54.40 --> 00:29:01.16
We sent out cold trucks to the city streets and villages to seize a lot of women.

333
00:29:01.16 --> 00:29:12.76
And then each of them was allocated to 15 to 20 soldiers for sexual intercourse and abuse.

334
00:29:12.76 --> 00:29:20.32
Surviving Japanese veterans claim that the army had officially outlawed rape of enemy

335
00:29:20.32 --> 00:29:21.68
women.

336
00:29:21.68 --> 00:29:26.68
But rape remained so deeply embedded in Japanese military culture and superstition that no one

337
00:29:26.68 --> 00:29:29.32
took the rule seriously.

338
00:29:29.32 --> 00:29:35.60
They believed that raping virgins would make them more powerful in battle.

339
00:29:35.60 --> 00:29:41.56
Soldiers were even known to wear amulets, made from the pubic hair of such victims, believing

340
00:29:41.56 --> 00:29:46.56
that they possessed magical powers against injury.

341
00:29:46.56 --> 00:29:55.76
The military policy forbidding rape only encouraged soldiers to kill their victims afterwards.

342
00:29:55.76 --> 00:30:01.60
Having an interview for the documentary in the name of the emperor, as you must shiro,

343
00:30:01.60 --> 00:30:09.12
a former Japanese soldier spoke candidly about the process of rape and murder in Nanking.

344
00:30:09.12 --> 00:30:11.48
We took turns raping them.

345
00:30:11.48 --> 00:30:14.000
It would be alright if we only rape them.

346
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
I shouldn't say alright, but we always stabbed and killed them because dead bodies don't

347
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.40
talk.

348
00:30:25.40 --> 00:30:30.28
Back a coro-koso shared asumas bluntness and discussing the issue.

349
00:30:30.28 --> 00:30:33.24
After raping, we would also kill them.

350
00:30:33.24 --> 00:30:39.16
He recalled, these women would start to flee once we let them go.

351
00:30:39.16 --> 00:30:46.24
Then we would bang, shoot them in the back and finish them up.

352
00:30:46.24 --> 00:30:50.44
According to surviving veterans, many of the soldiers felt remarkably little guilt about

353
00:30:50.44 --> 00:30:53.16
this.

354
00:30:53.16 --> 00:30:57.92
Perhaps when we were raping her, we looked at her as a woman, a zoomerote.

355
00:30:57.92 --> 00:31:20.60
But when we killed her, we just thought of her as something like a pig.

356
00:31:20.60 --> 00:31:30.20
So where is this mindset comes from that permits this kind of behavior?

357
00:31:30.20 --> 00:31:32.40
I'm going to the book.

358
00:31:32.40 --> 00:31:38.12
The Japanese soldier was not simply hardened for battle in China.

359
00:31:38.12 --> 00:31:43.88
He was hardened for the task of murdering Chinese combatants and non-combatants alike.

360
00:31:43.88 --> 00:31:51.56
Indeed, various games and exercises were set up by the Japanese military to nomads men to

361
00:31:51.56 --> 00:31:56.20
the human instinct against killing people who are not attacking.

362
00:31:56.20 --> 00:32:02.30
For example, on the way to the capital, Japanese soldiers were made to participate in killing

363
00:32:02.30 --> 00:32:09.88
competitions, which were avidly covered by the Japanese media like sporting events.

364
00:32:09.88 --> 00:32:15.64
The most notorious one appeared in the December 7th issue of the Japan advisor under the

365
00:32:15.64 --> 00:32:24.28
headline, sub-lutenants race to fell 100 Chinese running close contest.

366
00:32:24.28 --> 00:32:32.72
Sub-lutenant Mukaay Toshiyaki and sub-lutenant Noda Takishi.

367
00:32:32.72 --> 00:32:40.76
They were in a contest, friendly contest to see which one of them will first fell 100 Chinese

368
00:32:40.76 --> 00:32:45.96
individuals' individual's sword combat.

369
00:32:45.96 --> 00:32:52.12
Before the Japanese forces completely occupied Nanking, they're well in the final phase

370
00:32:52.12 --> 00:32:56.44
of their race running almost neck to neck.

371
00:32:56.44 --> 00:33:05.38
On Sunday, December 5th, the score, according to Asahi, was sub-lutenant Mukaay 89 and

372
00:33:05.38 --> 00:33:13.44
sub-lutenant Noda 78.

373
00:33:13.44 --> 00:33:21.52
Just to give some more context on this, these were just lining people up and chopping their

374
00:33:21.52 --> 00:33:22.52
heads off.

375
00:33:22.52 --> 00:33:23.52
That's what this was.

376
00:33:23.52 --> 00:33:32.92
This is lining up civilians and let's see who can get to 150 or 100 first.

377
00:33:32.92 --> 00:33:36.68
Back to the book a week later, the paper reported that neither man could decide who had

378
00:33:36.68 --> 00:33:43.60
passed the 100 mark first, so they up the goal to 150.

379
00:33:43.60 --> 00:33:48.88
Mukaay's blade was slightly damaged in the competition that Japan advisor reported.

380
00:33:48.88 --> 00:33:55.20
He explained that this was the result of cutting a Chinese in half, helmet and all.

381
00:33:55.20 --> 00:33:58.000
The contest was fun.

382
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:06.88
He declared.

383
00:34:06.88 --> 00:34:16.24
Another Japanese soldier talking about his experience, Tommy Nagashozo wrote, we made them

384
00:34:16.24 --> 00:34:18.28
like this.

385
00:34:18.28 --> 00:34:22.84
Good sons, good daddies, good elder brothers at home were brought to the front to kill

386
00:34:22.84 --> 00:34:25.000
each other.

387
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.92
Human beings turned into murdering demons.

388
00:34:28.92 --> 00:34:34.88
Everyone became a demon within three months.

389
00:34:34.88 --> 00:34:42.24
In interview, after interview, Japanese veterans from the Nanking Massacre reported honestly

390
00:34:42.24 --> 00:34:47.04
that they experienced a complete lack of remorse or sense of wrongdoing even when torturing

391
00:34:47.04 --> 00:34:50.000
helpless civilians.

392
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.52
Nagatomi Hakuto spoke candidly about his emotions in the fallen capital.

393
00:34:55.52 --> 00:35:01.44
I remember being driven in a truck along a path that had been cleared through piles of

394
00:35:01.44 --> 00:35:05.76
thousands and thousands of slaughtered bodies.

395
00:35:05.76 --> 00:35:10.44
Wild dogs were gnawing at the dead flesh as we stopped and pulled a group of Chinese

396
00:35:10.44 --> 00:35:13.20
prisoners out of the back.

397
00:35:13.20 --> 00:35:17.12
Then the Japanese officer proposed a test of my courage.

398
00:35:17.12 --> 00:35:22.44
He unsheathed his sword, spat on it, and with a sudden mighty swing he brought it down on

399
00:35:22.44 --> 00:35:26.64
the neck of a Chinese boy cowering before us.

400
00:35:26.64 --> 00:35:33.52
The head was cut clean off and tumbled away on the group as the body slumped forward.

401
00:35:33.52 --> 00:35:39.32
Blood spurting out into great gushing fountains from the neck.

402
00:35:39.32 --> 00:35:46.08
The officer suggested I take the head home as a souvenir.

403
00:35:46.08 --> 00:35:53.88
I remember smiling proudly as I took his sword and began killing people.

404
00:35:53.88 --> 00:35:59.88
Few know that soldiers in pailed babies on bayonets and tossed them still alive into pots of

405
00:35:59.88 --> 00:36:02.32
boiling water.

406
00:36:02.32 --> 00:36:09.04
The gang raped women from ages of 12 to 80 and then killed them when they could no longer

407
00:36:09.04 --> 00:36:12.48
satisfy sexual requirements.

408
00:36:12.48 --> 00:36:19.24
I beheaded people, starve them to death, burn them and bury them alive over 200 in

409
00:36:19.24 --> 00:36:21.24
all.

410
00:36:21.24 --> 00:36:26.88
It is terrible that I could turn into an animal and do these things.

411
00:36:26.88 --> 00:36:33.48
There are really no words to explain what I was doing.

412
00:36:33.48 --> 00:36:52.76
I was truly a devil.

413
00:36:52.76 --> 00:37:05.08
And on those situations torture was also completely common.

414
00:37:05.08 --> 00:37:06.84
And here's what the book says.

415
00:37:06.84 --> 00:37:11.92
The torture that the Japanese inflicted upon the native population at Nanking almost suppresses

416
00:37:11.92 --> 00:37:19.52
suppresses the limits of human comprehension here are only a few examples.

417
00:37:19.52 --> 00:37:24.56
Five burials, the Japanese directed burial operations with the precision and efficiency

418
00:37:24.56 --> 00:37:26.64
of an assembly line.

419
00:37:26.64 --> 00:37:30.92
Soldiers would force one group of Chinese captives to dig a grave, a second group to bury

420
00:37:30.92 --> 00:37:35.52
the first and then a third group to bury the second and so on.

421
00:37:35.52 --> 00:37:39.76
Some victims were partially buried to their chest or necks so that they would endure

422
00:37:39.76 --> 00:37:48.48
further agony such as being hacked to pieces by swords or run over by horses and tanks.

423
00:37:48.48 --> 00:37:54.60
The Japanese not only disemboweled, decapatated and dismembered victims but performed

424
00:37:54.60 --> 00:37:58.88
more excruciating varieties of torture.

425
00:37:58.88 --> 00:38:02.92
Throughout the city they nailed prisoners to wooden boards and ran over them with tanks,

426
00:38:02.92 --> 00:38:07.56
crucified them to trees and electrical posts, carved long strips of flesh from them and

427
00:38:07.56 --> 00:38:10.36
used them for bayonet practice.

428
00:38:10.36 --> 00:38:15.88
At least 100 men reportedly had their eyes gouged out and their noses and ears hacked

429
00:38:15.88 --> 00:38:22.12
off before being set on fire.

430
00:38:22.12 --> 00:38:27.04
Another group of 200 Chinese soldiers and civilians were stripped naked tied to columns

431
00:38:27.04 --> 00:38:32.88
and doors of a school and then stabbed by special needles with handles on them in hundreds

432
00:38:32.88 --> 00:38:42.12
of points along their bodies including their mouths, throats and eyes.

433
00:38:42.12 --> 00:38:44.32
Death by fire.

434
00:38:44.32 --> 00:38:51.56
The Japanese subjected large crowds of victims to mass incineration.

435
00:38:51.56 --> 00:38:55.92
A Japanese soldier bound Chinese captives together ten at a time and pushed them into a

436
00:38:55.92 --> 00:39:01.08
pit where they were sprayed with gasoline and ignited.

437
00:39:01.08 --> 00:39:06.84
On taping road, the Japanese ordered a large number of shop clerks to extinguish a fire

438
00:39:06.84 --> 00:39:11.96
then bound them together with rope and threw them into the blaze.

439
00:39:11.96 --> 00:39:16.28
Japanese soldiers even devised games with fire.

440
00:39:16.28 --> 00:39:20.28
One method of entertainment was to drive mobs of Chinese to the top stories or roofs

441
00:39:20.28 --> 00:39:27.16
of buildings tear down the stairs and then set the bottom floors on fire.

442
00:39:27.16 --> 00:39:33.24
Many such victims committed suicide by jumping out of windows or off-roop tops.

443
00:39:33.24 --> 00:39:38.12
Another form of amusement involved dousing victims in fuel, shooting them and watching

444
00:39:38.12 --> 00:39:42.20
them explode into flame.

445
00:39:42.20 --> 00:39:47.12
In one infamous incident, Japanese soldiers forced hundreds of men, women and children into

446
00:39:47.12 --> 00:39:55.12
a square soaked them with gasoline and then fired on them with machine guns.

447
00:39:55.12 --> 00:39:56.72
Death by ice.

448
00:39:56.72 --> 00:40:01.76
Thousands of victims were intentionally frozen to death during the rape of Nanking.

449
00:40:01.76 --> 00:40:06.12
For instance, Japanese soldiers forced hundreds of Chinese prisoners to march the edge of

450
00:40:06.12 --> 00:40:10.12
a frozen pond where they were ordered to strip naked, break the ice and plunge in the

451
00:40:10.12 --> 00:40:13.84
water to go fishing.

452
00:40:13.84 --> 00:40:19.72
Their bodies hardened into floating targets that were immediately riddled with Japanese bullets.

453
00:40:19.72 --> 00:40:24.28
In another incident, the Japanese tied up a group of refugees flung them into a shallow

454
00:40:24.28 --> 00:40:34.56
pond and bombarding them with hang grenades causing an explosive shower of blood and flesh.

455
00:40:34.56 --> 00:40:40.08
By dogs, one diabolical means of torture was to bury victims to their waste and watch

456
00:40:40.08 --> 00:40:44.72
them get ripped apart by German shepherds.

457
00:40:44.72 --> 00:40:50.48
Witnesses saw Japanese soldiers strip a victim naked and direct German shepherds to bite

458
00:40:50.48 --> 00:40:54.48
sensitive areas of his body.

459
00:40:54.48 --> 00:40:59.20
The dogs not only ripped open his belly but jerked out his intestines along the ground

460
00:40:59.20 --> 00:41:03.04
for a distance.

461
00:41:03.04 --> 00:41:07.72
The incidents mentioned above are only a fraction of the methods that the Japanese use to

462
00:41:07.72 --> 00:41:11.04
torment their victims.

463
00:41:11.04 --> 00:41:19.36
The Japanese saturated victims in acid and pale babies with bayonets hung people by their tongues.

464
00:41:19.36 --> 00:41:23.64
One Japanese reporter who later investigated the rape of Nanking learned that at least

465
00:41:23.64 --> 00:41:30.64
one Japanese soldier tore the heart and liver out of a Chinese victim to eat them.

466
00:41:30.64 --> 00:41:36.32
In genitals apparently were consumed, a Chinese soldier who escaped from Japanese custody

467
00:41:36.32 --> 00:41:41.68
saw several dead people in the streets with their penises cut off.

468
00:41:41.68 --> 00:41:46.88
He was later told that the penises were sold to Japanese customers who believed that eating

469
00:41:46.88 --> 00:42:05.60
them would increase fertility.

470
00:42:05.60 --> 00:42:16.28
With regards to the fate of the women, they don't know how to determine the exact number

471
00:42:16.28 --> 00:42:23.40
of the women that were raped in Nanking.

472
00:42:23.40 --> 00:42:30.60
But they do know that it was almost a universal.

473
00:42:30.60 --> 00:42:35.08
Back to the book, the Japanese raped Nanking Women from all classes.

474
00:42:35.08 --> 00:42:41.48
Farmwives, students, teachers, white collar and blue collar workers, wives of YMCA employees,

475
00:42:41.48 --> 00:42:50.12
university professors, even Buddhist nuns, some of whom were gang-raped to death.

476
00:42:50.12 --> 00:42:52.72
And they were systematic in their recruitment of women.

477
00:42:52.72 --> 00:42:57.56
And Nanking, Japanese soldiers searched for them constantly as they looted homes and dragged

478
00:42:57.56 --> 00:43:01.40
men off-wrecks execution.

479
00:43:01.40 --> 00:43:09.92
Some actually conducted door-to-door searches demanding money and young girls.

480
00:43:09.92 --> 00:43:16.04
Chinese women were raped in all locations and at all hours.

481
00:43:16.04 --> 00:43:20.28
An estimated one-third of all rapes occurred during the day.

482
00:43:20.28 --> 00:43:25.24
Survivors even remember soldiers prying open in the legs of victims to rape them and broad

483
00:43:25.24 --> 00:43:30.92
daylight in the middle of the street and in front of crowds of witnesses.

484
00:43:30.92 --> 00:43:33.20
No place was too sacred for rape.

485
00:43:33.20 --> 00:43:40.92
The Japanese attacked women in nunneries, churches, and Bible training schools.

486
00:43:40.92 --> 00:43:48.92
17 soldiers raped one woman in succession in a seminary compound.

487
00:43:48.92 --> 00:43:51.76
Old age was no concern to the Japanese.

488
00:43:51.76 --> 00:43:59.08
Matrix, grandmothers and great-grandmothers and dirt-repeded sexual assaults.

489
00:43:59.08 --> 00:44:05.16
So Japanese soldiers who raped a woman of 60 was ordered to clean the penis by her mouth.

490
00:44:05.16 --> 00:44:09.64
When a woman of 62 protested the soldiers that was she was too old for sex, they rammed

491
00:44:09.64 --> 00:44:15.48
a stick up and stied her instead.

492
00:44:15.48 --> 00:44:21.04
Many women in their 80s were raped to death and at least one woman in that age group was

493
00:44:21.04 --> 00:44:36.96
shot and killed because she refused to Japanese soldiers' advances.

494
00:44:36.96 --> 00:44:41.16
If the Japanese treatment of old women was terrible, their treatment of young children was

495
00:44:41.16 --> 00:44:45.04
unthinkable.

496
00:44:45.04 --> 00:44:51.000
Little girls were raped so brutally that some could not walk for weeks afterwards.

497
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.28
Many required surgery others died.

498
00:44:56.28 --> 00:45:01.68
Chinese witnesses saw Japanese rape girls under 10 years of age in the streets and then

499
00:45:01.68 --> 00:45:06.16
slashed them in half by sword.

500
00:45:06.16 --> 00:45:11.68
In some cases the Japanese sliced open the vaginas of pre-teen girls in order to ravish

501
00:45:11.68 --> 00:45:28.20
them more effectively.

502
00:45:28.20 --> 00:45:35.96
Even in advanced stages of pregnancy did not render women immune to assault.

503
00:45:35.96 --> 00:45:41.04
The Japanese violated many who were about to go into labor were in labor or who had given

504
00:45:41.04 --> 00:45:44.40
birth only a few days earlier.

505
00:45:44.40 --> 00:45:49.64
One victim who his nine months pregnant was raped suffered not only still birth but a complete

506
00:45:49.64 --> 00:45:52.28
mental collapse.

507
00:45:52.28 --> 00:45:55.92
At least one pregnant woman was kicked to death.

508
00:45:55.92 --> 00:45:59.56
Still more gruesome was the treatment a lot of the some of the unborn children of these

509
00:45:59.56 --> 00:46:02.000
women.

510
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000
After gang rape, Japanese soldiers sometimes slashed open the bellies of pregnant women ripped

511
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:35.16
out the fetuses for amusement.

512
00:46:35.16 --> 00:46:39.04
During the mass rape the Japanese destroyed children and infants often because they were

513
00:46:39.04 --> 00:46:41.40
in the way.

514
00:46:41.40 --> 00:46:44.56
I witnessed his report.

515
00:46:44.56 --> 00:46:49.000
Described children and babies suffocating from clothes stuffed in their mouths or bayonet

516
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.40
into death because they whept as their mothers were being raped.

517
00:46:53.40 --> 00:46:58.88
American and European observers of the rape of Nanking recorded numerous entries like this

518
00:46:58.88 --> 00:47:02.52
one.

519
00:47:02.52 --> 00:47:09.24
February 3rd about 5 p.m. at Chang Su's saying three soldiers came and forced a woman

520
00:47:09.24 --> 00:47:12.68
to throw away her baby after raping her.

521
00:47:12.68 --> 00:47:34.60
They went away laughing.

522
00:47:34.60 --> 00:47:40.76
Perhaps one of the most brutal forms of Japanese entertainment was the impalement of vaginas.

523
00:47:40.76 --> 00:47:46.28
In the streets of Nanking corpses of women lay with their legs, split open, their orifice

524
00:47:46.28 --> 00:47:50.80
pierced by wooden rods, twigs and weeds.

525
00:47:50.80 --> 00:47:55.72
It is painful, almost mind-numbing to contemplate some of the other objects that were used

526
00:47:55.72 --> 00:48:03.56
to torment the Nanking women who suffered almost unendurable or deals.

527
00:48:03.56 --> 00:48:07.92
For instance one Japanese soldier who raped a young woman for us to beer bottle into her

528
00:48:07.92 --> 00:48:10.64
and shatter.

529
00:48:10.64 --> 00:48:15.80
The rape victim was found with a golf stick rammed into her.

530
00:48:15.80 --> 00:48:22.80
On December 22nd, in a neighborhood near the gate of Tonging Men, the Japanese raped a

531
00:48:22.80 --> 00:48:26.56
barber's wife and then stuck a firecracker in her vagina.

532
00:48:26.56 --> 00:48:35.64
It blew up and killed her.

533
00:48:35.64 --> 00:48:39.36
Not all the victims were women.

534
00:48:39.36 --> 00:48:44.24
Japanese men were often sawdomized or forced to perform a variety of repulsive sexual acts

535
00:48:44.24 --> 00:48:49.20
in front of laughing Chinese soldiers or Japanese soldiers.

536
00:48:49.20 --> 00:48:53.08
At least one Chinese man was murdered because he refused to commit necrophilia with the

537
00:48:53.08 --> 00:48:58.80
corpse of a woman in the snow.

538
00:48:58.80 --> 00:49:03.48
The Japanese also delighted in trying to cause men who had taken lifetime vows of celibacy

539
00:49:03.48 --> 00:49:07.000
to engage in sexual intercourse.

540
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.16
The Chinese woman had tried to disguise herself as a man trying to pass through the gates

541
00:49:11.16 --> 00:49:15.56
of Nanking but Japanese guards who systematically searched all passing pedestrians by

542
00:49:15.56 --> 00:49:20.80
groping at their crutches, discovered her true sex.

543
00:49:20.80 --> 00:49:26.64
Gang raped followed at which time a Buddhist monk had the misfortune to venture near the

544
00:49:26.64 --> 00:49:27.64
scene.

545
00:49:27.64 --> 00:49:32.32
The Japanese tried to force him to have sex to the woman they had just raped.

546
00:49:32.32 --> 00:49:41.76
In the monk protested, they castrated him, causing the poor man to bleed to death.

547
00:49:41.76 --> 00:49:48.88
Some of the most sorted instances of sexual torture involved the degradation of entire families.

548
00:49:48.88 --> 00:49:53.92
The Japanese drew sadistic pleasure in forcing Chinese men to commit incest, fathers

549
00:49:53.92 --> 00:49:59.44
to rape their own daughters, brothers, their sisters, sons, their mothers.

550
00:49:59.44 --> 00:50:04.32
A Chinese battalion commander stranded in Nanking for three months after the city fell,

551
00:50:04.32 --> 00:50:08.80
saw her heard of at least four or five instances in which the Japanese ordered sons to

552
00:50:08.80 --> 00:50:12.56
rape their mothers.

553
00:50:12.56 --> 00:50:16.36
Those who refused were killed on the spot.

554
00:50:16.36 --> 00:50:21.20
As reported, substantiated by the testimony of a German diplomat who reported that one

555
00:50:21.20 --> 00:50:25.52
Chinese man who refused to rape his own mother was killed with saber strokes and that

556
00:50:25.52 --> 00:50:47.32
his mother committed suicide shortly thereafter.

557
00:50:47.32 --> 00:50:50.96
Those who defied the Japanese were often found later with their eyes torn out their

558
00:50:50.96 --> 00:51:12.96
noses, ears, and breasts cut off.

559
00:51:12.96 --> 00:51:26.76
As I said, this is purieval.

560
00:51:26.76 --> 00:51:46.28
And I don't know what else to say.

561
00:51:46.28 --> 00:51:50.84
Now I'm going to the book here.

562
00:51:50.84 --> 00:51:55.40
It's hard to talk about a bright spot in the horror that is the rape of Nanking, but if one

563
00:51:55.40 --> 00:52:00.68
can, it is surely to shine a light on the actions of a small band of Americans and Europeans

564
00:52:00.68 --> 00:52:06.68
who risked their lives to defy the Japanese invaders and rescue hundreds of thousands of

565
00:52:06.68 --> 00:52:11.24
Chinese refugees from almost certain extermination.

566
00:52:11.24 --> 00:52:15.64
The courageous men and women created the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone.

567
00:52:15.64 --> 00:52:25.16
So this is amongst obviously this just most sadistic and heinous evil.

568
00:52:25.16 --> 00:52:32.24
There were some Americans and some Europeans that lived and worked in Nanking.

569
00:52:32.24 --> 00:52:36.80
You got to remember this is 1937, so it wasn't a world war yet.

570
00:52:36.80 --> 00:52:41.88
There was Germans, there in Nanking, there was Americans, there in Nanking.

571
00:52:41.88 --> 00:52:48.88
So when this started to happen, there was several of them who basically formed an area,

572
00:52:48.88 --> 00:52:52.76
which I did, you know, this is a safe zone.

573
00:52:52.76 --> 00:53:00.04
And one of them interestingly was a German and it was a Nazi.

574
00:53:00.04 --> 00:53:06.76
So there's a Nazi who they ended up calling the living Buddha of Nanking.

575
00:53:06.76 --> 00:53:18.96
And so this individual John Rae was, he risked his life to set up the safety zone and

576
00:53:18.96 --> 00:53:26.12
actually, you know, he was like I said, he was a Nazi, but he had spent so much time

577
00:53:26.12 --> 00:53:31.84
in Nanking that he had all these Chinese friends and you know, according to the background

578
00:53:31.84 --> 00:53:37.28
on him, you know, he's there in 19, he's been there for many years and I don't know what

579
00:53:37.28 --> 00:53:40.76
you got there, but he's not familiar with what's going on with the actual Nazi party

580
00:53:40.76 --> 00:53:41.76
back in Germany.

581
00:53:41.76 --> 00:53:42.76
He's disconnected.

582
00:53:42.76 --> 00:53:45.28
I mean, there's, you know, this is whatever, there's no internet.

583
00:53:45.28 --> 00:53:47.20
He's not watching TV, he doesn't know what's going on.

584
00:53:47.20 --> 00:53:51.60
So he was just sort of sort of there and oh, the prominent party in Germany is the Nazi

585
00:53:51.60 --> 00:53:52.60
party.

586
00:53:52.60 --> 00:53:56.12
Oh, and I'm a diplomat, so I guess I'm a Nazi.

587
00:53:56.12 --> 00:54:01.28
And, but when he, you know, he sounded like he was a guy that was a benevolent guy.

588
00:54:01.28 --> 00:54:06.88
He actually went out into town and literally stopped rapes from happening himself.

589
00:54:06.88 --> 00:54:11.60
And what's interesting is, and this, this, to me, set up that, you could see what they

590
00:54:11.60 --> 00:54:15.80
thought of the Chinese people is that all he would do is go out and speak stop.

591
00:54:15.80 --> 00:54:20.52
And he, he had the Nazi armband or what he had Nazi either, the swastika.

592
00:54:20.52 --> 00:54:22.56
And when they saw that, they would listen to him.

593
00:54:22.56 --> 00:54:27.52
And so I mean, he's so like he was a white guy and they, they clearly listened to him

594
00:54:27.52 --> 00:54:35.20
and were kind of afraid of him. And yet, you know, obviously they had zero, less than zero,

595
00:54:35.20 --> 00:54:44.04
respect for the Chinese people. And so, so he actually wrote a letter as well to Hitler,

596
00:54:44.04 --> 00:54:50.08
explaining what was going on. And, you know, there's no one knows if Hitler actually ever

597
00:54:50.08 --> 00:54:55.12
read it. It sounds like he read it and ignored it. But one of the most interesting and

598
00:54:55.12 --> 00:55:02.72
important pieces of what John Rae did is he, he kept the journal, a detailed journal of what

599
00:55:02.72 --> 00:55:08.64
had happened. So a lot of the stuff that I just quoted, which I know is, is horrible. He was

600
00:55:08.64 --> 00:55:14.56
the guy. He's one of the people that wrote it down and made sure that that was going to

601
00:55:14.56 --> 00:55:24.08
be recorded. And actually the, the, that diary didn't get really discovered and uncovered

602
00:55:24.08 --> 00:55:30.32
until much later, until really, and, and, and Iris Chang is the one that sort of popularized

603
00:55:30.32 --> 00:55:36.40
and took this journal and made it into a real document that explained what had happened there.

604
00:55:37.12 --> 00:55:44.96
So that's, you know, again, this, this John Rae, you know, let's, let's, let's even in all

605
00:55:44.96 --> 00:55:50.000
that darkness. There was people that stepped up and spoke against it. Another one was a guy named

606
00:55:50.000 --> 00:56:00.72
by the name of Robert Wilson and he was actually grew up in Nan King and he was a Methodist missionary.

607
00:56:01.20 --> 00:56:05.84
But he had then left Nan King and gone back to America. He went to Princeton and then he went

608
00:56:05.84 --> 00:56:10.64
to Harvard Medical School and when he got done with all of his schooling. Instead of staying in

609
00:56:10.64 --> 00:56:17.68
America, he went back to Nan King to become a surgeon in Nan King and he was him along with John Rae,

610
00:56:17.68 --> 00:56:23.60
these were the guys that went out and set up this protective zone and did all kinds of, you know,

611
00:56:23.60 --> 00:56:28.72
it's sort of like a Schindler's list scenario. They were helping soldiers get rid of their papers

612
00:56:28.72 --> 00:56:34.32
and given clothes. They didn't look like Chinese soldiers. It's sheltering women, bringing, setting up

613
00:56:35.12 --> 00:56:39.52
places where the women could hide in the addicts of the buildings. That's what they were doing.

614
00:56:39.52 --> 00:56:42.24
And it's the only thing that's, well, I guess not different, but, you know,

615
00:56:42.24 --> 00:56:49.36
it's different in the fact that they could get away with it because we weren't at war with the Japanese.

616
00:56:50.96 --> 00:56:55.44
And so this guy Wilson was a surgeon. So not only was he trying to protect people,

617
00:56:55.44 --> 00:56:59.84
he was doing surgery on them all the time trying to get them to, trying to save them from these

618
00:56:59.84 --> 00:57:10.88
devastating wounds that they had. He also kept a really detailed diary, which again, these,

619
00:57:10.88 --> 00:57:19.60
and this is, you know, part of a whole kind of genesis of this book is that, and I'll get to this later,

620
00:57:19.60 --> 00:57:26.000
but, you know, you've heard of like Holocaust deniers of the Holocaust and happened to well,

621
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.36
it's the same thing with this event. People say, oh, and it wasn't that bad. You know,

622
00:57:29.36 --> 00:57:33.28
wasn't that big of a deal that we know, there was some killing. So there was people that said that,

623
00:57:33.28 --> 00:57:37.12
you know, some Japanese nationalists had said, oh, that didn't really wasn't really that bad. It was

624
00:57:37.12 --> 00:57:42.88
provoked or whatever they're going to say. And these documents, these, these documents that

625
00:57:42.88 --> 00:57:49.44
corroborated all this information were truly important. Going back to the book here, one of the

626
00:57:49.44 --> 00:57:54.56
worst scenes, Nilsen's song, Nett Wilson saw Nann King, a scene he would remember for the rest of his life,

627
00:57:54.56 --> 00:58:01.60
a massive gang of, a massive gang rape of teenage girls in the street, a group of young women

628
00:58:01.60 --> 00:58:07.12
between the ages of 15 and 18 were lined up by Japanese and then raped in the dirt one after the

629
00:58:07.12 --> 00:58:15.12
other by an entire regiment. Some hebronched and died while others killed themselves shortly afterwards.

630
00:58:16.32 --> 00:58:22.16
But the scenes in the hospitals were even more horrifying than those in the streets. Wilson was

631
00:58:22.16 --> 00:58:27.68
mortified by the women who came to the emergency room with their bellies ripped open by the

632
00:58:27.68 --> 00:58:33.36
charred and horribly disfingered men, whom the Japanese tried to burn alive and by numerous other

633
00:58:33.36 --> 00:58:40.80
horrors he had barely had time to describe on paper. He told his wife that he would never

634
00:58:40.80 --> 00:58:46.48
forget a woman whose head was nearly cut off teetering from a point on her neck. The morning

635
00:58:47.28 --> 00:58:54.48
came this morning, this is quote, this morning another woman came in a sad plate and with a terrible

636
00:58:54.48 --> 00:59:02.96
story, a hospital volunteer wrote of this woman in his diary in January 3rd, 1938. She was one of

637
00:59:02.96 --> 00:59:07.52
the five women whom the Japanese soldier had taken to one of their medical units to wash their clothes

638
00:59:07.52 --> 00:59:13.52
to buy day and be raped by night. Two of them were forced, the two of them were forced to

639
00:59:13.52 --> 00:59:18.48
satisfy from 15 to 20 men and the prettiest one as much as 40 each night.

640
00:59:18.48 --> 00:59:26.08
This one who came to us had been called off by three soldiers into an isolated place where they

641
00:59:26.08 --> 00:59:31.44
attempted to cut off her head. The muscles of the neck had been cut but they failed this

642
00:59:31.44 --> 00:59:36.96
sever the spinal cord. She fained death but dragged herself to the hospital another

643
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.36
of the many to bear witness to the brutality of the soldiers.

644
00:59:41.36 --> 00:59:53.60
So Wilson just saw complete horrors then back to the book he operated for free because

645
00:59:53.60 --> 00:59:58.48
few patients had money to pay him but the surgeries exacted a terrible price on his own health.

646
00:59:59.20 --> 01:00:04.56
In the end his family believes that the only his faith as a devout Methodist combined with

647
01:00:04.56 --> 01:00:15.84
his love for China gave him the courage to survive the rape of Nanking. Another one of these

648
01:00:15.84 --> 01:00:24.96
Europeans in this case, American, Westerner, I should say, was Ville Helmina Votron or many

649
01:00:24.96 --> 01:00:33.92
Votron as they called her as biocupation, head of the education department, Dean of studies at

650
01:00:33.92 --> 01:00:40.72
Ginnling Women's Arts and Science College was one of the few Western women in the city during the

651
01:00:40.72 --> 01:00:46.000
first few weeks of the Nanking massacre. Years later she would be remembered not only for her

652
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.04
courage in protecting thousands of women from Japanese soldier but also for the diary she kept.

653
01:00:51.04 --> 01:00:56.40
A diary that some historians believe will eventually be recognized much like the diary of Anne Frank

654
01:00:56.40 --> 01:01:01.28
for its importance in illuminating the spirit of a single witness during the Holocaust of war.

655
01:01:04.08 --> 01:01:11.04
Votron, the daughter of a blacksmith was 51 years old in 1937 raised in the tiny farming community

656
01:01:11.04 --> 01:01:17.28
of Sector, Illinois. She went to live with neighbors when her mother died. Despite the

657
01:01:17.28 --> 01:01:22.000
impoverishment of her childhood, she was able to work her way through school, graduating with

658
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.60
honors in 1912 from the University of Illinois at Urbana, Champagne.

659
01:01:32.40 --> 01:01:39.52
So, just again, a Westerner in this case in American, and she had the opportunity to

660
01:01:39.52 --> 01:01:45.12
maybe escape but she stayed in Nanking. Back to the book with most of the faculty gone from

661
01:01:45.12 --> 01:01:51.28
Nanking, most of the abandoned their homes to flee to cities like Shanghai, Shenku, and Sichuan.

662
01:01:52.64 --> 01:01:58.80
Votron was now the acting head of the institution. She labored to prepare for the campus for female

663
01:01:58.80 --> 01:02:03.52
refugees and to evacuate wounded soldiers from the area. To disguise their identity, she burned

664
01:02:03.52 --> 01:02:07.92
their military papers and garments in the college and senator. Under her direction furniture

665
01:02:07.92 --> 01:02:13.68
was moved into addicts, safes were emptied, dorms were cleaned. And valuables were wrapped

666
01:02:13.68 --> 01:02:21.12
in oil paper and hidden. Meanwhile, posters, signs and arm bands for the Nanking Safety Zone

667
01:02:21.12 --> 01:02:24.16
were created and distributed among the volunteers.

668
01:02:32.32 --> 01:02:37.76
Here's talking about a specific day. The following day, December 17, 1937 was even worse.

669
01:02:37.76 --> 01:02:43.36
The migration of women into gingling only intensified as the Japanese soldiers flooded the city.

670
01:02:43.36 --> 01:02:49.68
What a heartbreaking sight, Votron wrote. Weary women frightened girls trudging with children and

671
01:02:49.68 --> 01:02:54.88
bedding and small packages of clothes. They found someone had time to write the story of each

672
01:02:54.88 --> 01:03:00.32
refugee who came in, she thought, especially the stories of the girls who had blackened their faces

673
01:03:00.32 --> 01:03:06.72
and cut their hair. As she accommodated the stream of wild, eyed women, she heard stories of

674
01:03:06.72 --> 01:03:12.96
Japanese raping girls as young as 12, and women as elderly as 60, or raping pregnant women

675
01:03:12.96 --> 01:03:40.48
had been at point. And the sick and depraved and disgusting and horrific stories go on and on

676
01:03:40.48 --> 01:03:50.64
and on and the brutality page after page after page of diary entries and quotes and witness accounts.

677
01:03:53.04 --> 01:04:01.28
And then pictures. There is pictures in the book. The pictures of severed heads and

678
01:04:01.28 --> 01:04:07.20
Chinese bound to polls being bayoneted to death and pictures of others being beheaded and

679
01:04:07.20 --> 01:04:12.80
pictures of giant pits filled with bodies and images of hundreds and hundreds of bodies and

680
01:04:12.80 --> 01:04:28.000
entangled masses on the banks of the gangs you river. It's too much for the mind to comprehend.

681
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:38.24
It really is. It's almost too much to understand. And so what we do is we package it all up.

682
01:04:39.52 --> 01:04:46.32
Right. And we give it a name, a massacre or an atrocity.

683
01:04:46.32 --> 01:04:58.72
And I'm sure you could tell. I mean even as I'm sitting here reading this, I'm gone. I'm just numb.

684
01:05:01.44 --> 01:05:07.28
But we have to remember that every one of those people

685
01:05:07.28 --> 01:05:22.96
tortured, raped and killed was a person. A person like your brother or like your sister or

686
01:05:22.96 --> 01:05:40.08
like your mom or like your dad or a person like your son or your daughter. A person like you.

687
01:05:40.08 --> 01:05:58.48
And maybe you can get a hold of that. But what's in some ways even harder grasp is the Japanese soldiers.

688
01:05:58.48 --> 01:06:11.04
And they were people. And yes, they were certainly monsters,

689
01:06:12.80 --> 01:06:22.80
vile and despicable and completely devoid of feelings. But even so even though they were monsters,

690
01:06:22.80 --> 01:06:38.24
they were human monsters. And they too had mothers and fathers and sons and daughters. And yet they did this.

691
01:06:38.24 --> 01:06:56.08
And the fact that what happened at Nanking was so brutal and so beyond comparison with anything that

692
01:06:56.08 --> 01:07:08.80
ever happened was one of the things that almost caused it to be forgotten. And that that

693
01:07:10.32 --> 01:07:19.84
supreme level of brutality lasted about six weeks. And eventually that morphed into an

694
01:07:19.84 --> 01:07:26.32
occupation of Nanking by the Japanese. And they ruled with an iron fist, of course. And they stole

695
01:07:26.32 --> 01:07:35.76
and they plunged and they abused locals and they continued to rape. It's they actually institutionalized

696
01:07:35.76 --> 01:07:43.84
and eventually became even to term comfort women. And they gave out

697
01:07:43.84 --> 01:07:53.28
so, opium freely to and save people. Just like happens in this day and age, people become slaves to drugs.

698
01:07:56.16 --> 01:08:04.16
And it stayed in that occupied state for about eight years until

699
01:08:04.16 --> 01:08:14.56
finally almost as quickly as it began. He ended. I'm going back to the book.

700
01:08:17.60 --> 01:08:23.68
The end of Nanking's ordeal came in the last, came at last in the summer of 1945.

701
01:08:23.68 --> 01:08:33.36
On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an untested uranium bomb on Hiroshima,

702
01:08:33.36 --> 01:08:40.96
Japan's eighth largest city killing 100,000 of its 245 people, 245,000 people on the first day.

703
01:08:43.60 --> 01:08:49.60
When a Japanese surrender was not forthcoming, the Americans dropped on August 9, a second

704
01:08:49.60 --> 01:08:53.28
plutonium type bomb on the Japanese city of Nagasaki.

705
01:08:55.76 --> 01:09:01.20
Less than a week later, on August 14, the Japanese made the final decision to surrender.

706
01:09:04.32 --> 01:09:08.88
The Japanese remained in the former capital of China until the day of the surrender,

707
01:09:08.88 --> 01:09:14.24
then quickly left the city. I witnessed his reported that Japanese soldiers could be seen drinking

708
01:09:14.24 --> 01:09:19.52
heavily or weeping in the streets, some heard rumors of unarmed Japanese men being forced to

709
01:09:19.52 --> 01:09:25.76
kneel by the side of the road to be beaten by local residents. Retaliation against the Japanese

710
01:09:25.76 --> 01:09:31.20
garrison appears to be to have been limited, however, because many residents hid at home during

711
01:09:31.20 --> 01:09:35.60
this chaotic time too fearful to even celebrate the news of a Japanese defeat.

712
01:09:35.60 --> 01:09:45.04
The evacuation was swift and there was no mass persecution or imprisonment of Japanese soldiers.

713
01:09:46.24 --> 01:09:51.52
One Nanking resident recalls that she stayed in her house for weeks after the Japanese surrendered

714
01:09:51.52 --> 01:09:54.64
and when she reemerged, they were gone.

715
01:09:54.64 --> 01:10:12.48
It was over. There were some level of war crime trials and there were some executions.

716
01:10:14.24 --> 01:10:20.88
Mainly of the highest profile officers, Prince Asaka, who had given that order to kill all

717
01:10:20.88 --> 01:10:29.52
captives, he avoided prosecution. The scale of the massacre was downplayed. There was a bunch

718
01:10:29.52 --> 01:10:37.84
of reasons of why the scale of the rape of Nanking got downplayed. One of them being at the

719
01:10:37.84 --> 01:10:43.12
now Chinese Communist State was actually trying to build relationships with the post-war Japan.

720
01:10:43.12 --> 01:10:51.92
The massacre was quietly buried and now you had the Chinese people were now in a communist state.

721
01:10:51.92 --> 01:11:03.04
There wasn't much speaking out to do. The Japanese downplayed the horrors as saying it was just another

722
01:11:03.04 --> 01:11:08.96
incident of war. Some Japanese officials were quoted as saying it's a story made up by the

723
01:11:08.96 --> 01:11:16.64
Chinese. It's the image of Japan but it was a lie. They said things like, I think the Nanking

724
01:11:16.64 --> 01:11:24.48
Maskers are lie. The women that were raped were labeled as comfort women and licensed prostitutes

725
01:11:26.08 --> 01:11:31.20
and many Japanese officials say that what happened in Nanking was just a part of war.

726
01:11:31.20 --> 01:11:40.56
There's a really clear example of downplaying not only the rape of Nanking but of the war in

727
01:11:40.56 --> 01:11:50.96
general and they put this some of this in the book. They're talking about the Japanese

728
01:11:50.96 --> 01:11:56.96
education system. Here we go. Back to the book, the Japanese, the entire Japanese education

729
01:11:56.96 --> 01:12:03.60
system suffers from selective amnesia. For not until 1994, where Japanese schoolchildren taught

730
01:12:03.60 --> 01:12:08.40
that here, Hito's army was responsible for the death of at least 20 million allied soldiers in

731
01:12:08.40 --> 01:12:17.12
Asian civilians during World War II. In the early 1990s and newspaper article quoted a Japanese

732
01:12:17.12 --> 01:12:21.84
high school teacher who claimed that his students were surprised to learn that Japan had been at

733
01:12:21.84 --> 01:12:30.56
war with the United States. The first thing they wanted to know was who had won. In 1997,

734
01:12:30.56 --> 01:12:36.88
a 1977 the Ministry of Education reduced a section on World War II within a standard history book

735
01:12:36.88 --> 01:12:43.76
of several hundred pages to only six pages, which consisted mainly of pictures of American fire

736
01:12:43.76 --> 01:12:49.36
bombing of Tokyo, a picture of the ruins of Hiroshima and a tally of Japan's war dead.

737
01:12:49.36 --> 01:12:56.72
The text neglected to mention the casualties on the other side. Japanese war atrocities or the

738
01:12:56.72 --> 01:13:01.28
forced evacuations of Chinese and Korean prisoners to labor camps in Japan.

739
01:13:03.04 --> 01:13:07.68
Much of the censorship might have gone on challenge had it not been for the efforts of one brave

740
01:13:07.68 --> 01:13:16.000
crusader. In 1965, the Japanese historian, Anega Saburo sued the Japanese government.

741
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.24
This lawsuit was the beginning of a legal battle that would span three decades in gain the

742
01:13:22.24 --> 01:13:25.12
backing of thousands of sympathetic Japanese followers.

743
01:13:28.40 --> 01:13:33.68
The Ministry interfered with Anega's attempts to document the Nanking massacre for school children.

744
01:13:33.68 --> 01:13:36.72
For example, in his textbook manuscript, Anega wrote,

745
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.32
he wrote this quote, immediately after the occupation of Nanking, the Japanese army killed

746
01:13:42.32 --> 01:13:48.96
numerous Chinese soldiers and citizens. This incident became known as the Nan King massacre.

747
01:13:50.08 --> 01:13:57.28
When his book got checked by the examiner, the examiner commented, quote,

748
01:13:57.28 --> 01:14:01.60
readers might interpret this description as meeting, meaning that the Japanese army

749
01:14:01.60 --> 01:14:07.04
unilaterally massacreed Chinese immediately after the occupation. This passage should be revised

750
01:14:07.04 --> 01:14:18.000
that it is not interpreted in such a way. And here's what the passage eventually got changed to.

751
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.28
While battling the fierce resistance of the Chinese armed forces, the Japanese occupied

752
01:14:23.28 --> 01:14:29.36
Nanking and killed numerous Chinese soldiers and civilians, this incident came to be known as the

753
01:14:29.36 --> 01:14:35.52
Nan King massacre. That statement end quote, that statement might have been satisfied.

754
01:14:35.52 --> 01:14:39.84
That statement might have satisfied textbook sensors as a compromise between Anega's argument

755
01:14:39.84 --> 01:14:44.88
and the Ministry's position on the massacre. Unfortunately, the statement is simply not true

756
01:14:44.88 --> 01:14:48.08
because it implies that the massacre occurred in the heat of battle.

757
01:14:52.72 --> 01:14:59.04
Continuing on, the examiner demanded that Anega deletes his description of the rape itself,

758
01:14:59.04 --> 01:15:03.92
claiming that the violation of women is something that has happened on every battle field in

759
01:15:03.92 --> 01:15:09.12
every era of human history. This is not an issue that needs to be taken up with respect to the

760
01:15:09.12 --> 01:15:16.000
Japanese army in particular. Even the word aggression was deemed taboo. A aggression, the

761
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:26.96
censors wrote, is a term that contains negative ethical connotations. And that spirit that you can

762
01:15:26.96 --> 01:15:33.68
see very clearly that spirit of the Niali carried on, which is why when this book came out, this book,

763
01:15:33.68 --> 01:15:39.36
the rape of Nan King, when it came out, there were still Japanese nationalists that were

764
01:15:39.36 --> 01:15:49.28
staunchly against it. But Iris Chang who researched independently and wrote with passion,

765
01:15:49.28 --> 01:15:58.32
and she gave it all. She was a daughter of Chinese American immigrants and her parents,

766
01:15:58.32 --> 01:16:07.60
by the way, had connections to Nan King and escaped there. Both her parents had made it to America

767
01:16:07.60 --> 01:16:22.56
and become college professors, and Iris was compelled to tell this story. But like I said in the

768
01:16:22.56 --> 01:16:30.40
beginning, she was so close to this story that it took a toll of its own. And she was a writer,

769
01:16:30.40 --> 01:16:34.80
obviously, she got her batches degree in journalism, and eventually a master's in writing

770
01:16:34.80 --> 01:16:44.24
from Johns Hopkins University, and there's actually a book that's written about Iris.

771
01:16:44.88 --> 01:16:54.000
And the book is written by Iris's mother. Whose name is Dr. Ying Ying Chang, and the book is

772
01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:05.28
called the woman who could not forget. And I'm going to bring you through some portions of this

773
01:17:05.28 --> 01:17:10.72
book. So this book again, this is about Iris Chang, and it's written by her mother.

774
01:17:13.04 --> 01:17:17.76
This is how she got, is how she decided she was going to write about this.

775
01:17:17.76 --> 01:17:24.88
Here we go, quote, although Iris talked to us about her many book ideas for her next book,

776
01:17:24.88 --> 01:17:29.68
whilst he was writing our first book, her decision to write the rape of Nan King came all the sudden

777
01:17:29.68 --> 01:17:35.44
December 1994. As Iris told us, and as described in the book, she made her

778
01:17:35.44 --> 01:17:40.96
reminder right about this most atrocious chapter of history when she was attending a conference in

779
01:17:40.96 --> 01:17:48.000
California on December 13th, 1994. At the conference, there was a photo exhibition of the war

780
01:17:49.44 --> 01:17:54.80
of the war crimes committed in China in the 1930s, taking when the Japanese Army invaded Chinese

781
01:17:54.80 --> 01:18:00.88
territory. Iris wrote in her book. The light heard so much about the Nan King massacre as a child,

782
01:18:00.88 --> 01:18:06.56
nothing prepared me for these pictures. Stark black and white images of decapatated heads,

783
01:18:06.56 --> 01:18:12.08
Bellies ripped open a nude woman forced by their rapists into various pornographic poses,

784
01:18:12.08 --> 01:18:16.24
their faces contorted into unforgettable expressions of agony and shame.

785
01:18:17.36 --> 01:18:23.44
And she continued, in a single blinding moment, I recognized the fragility of not just life,

786
01:18:24.16 --> 01:18:31.36
but the human experience itself. Later, she told us in a telephone update that she simply must

787
01:18:31.36 --> 01:18:36.24
write about the rape of Nan King for her next book. It was a moral obligation and it would be

788
01:18:36.24 --> 01:18:42.40
justice for the victims as well. In 1998, after the rape of Nan King had been published,

789
01:18:42.40 --> 01:18:47.20
one Japanese reporter interviewed Iris and asked her, why did you decide to write this book?

790
01:18:47.92 --> 01:18:52.88
Iris replied, when I was a little girl, my parents shocked me with the story of the rape of

791
01:18:52.88 --> 01:18:59.20
Nan King. They told me that the Japanese imperial army massacred thousands of civilians in the

792
01:18:59.20 --> 01:19:05.44
capital of China and butchered even small children. This left the powerful impression on me,

793
01:19:05.44 --> 01:19:10.32
and I went to local libraries to learn more details, but I couldn't find a shred of information

794
01:19:10.32 --> 01:19:16.08
on the subject. There was nothing in my local school libraries or public city libraries

795
01:19:16.08 --> 01:19:22.72
or in my world history textbooks. Still worse, my teachers were completely ignorant of this event.

796
01:19:24.48 --> 01:19:29.92
The event remained a question mark in my mind for years until I saw an exhibit of photographs

797
01:19:29.92 --> 01:19:35.36
on the subject in 1994. The horror of those photographs inspired me to write the book.

798
01:19:39.60 --> 01:19:46.48
So that's how Iris got involved in writing the book. As a writer, luckily she was also a

799
01:19:46.48 --> 01:19:51.28
prolific letterwriter. I'm going to quote a bunch of her letters because her mother saved a bunch of

800
01:19:51.28 --> 01:19:59.76
her letters. Here is one that describes, I think it's a good insight into what her personality was like,

801
01:19:59.76 --> 01:20:04.64
when she was actually writing the book. This was a letter to her mom about what she was doing on

802
01:20:04.64 --> 01:20:09.44
the day-to-day basis. As she's writing this book, and this was her second book. So she'd already written

803
01:20:09.44 --> 01:20:14.56
one book. It had done okay, but this one was her, you know, her current project and here's what she said about it.

804
01:20:15.12 --> 01:20:19.60
Quote, on a typical day, I would rise between seven or eight a.m. and take the bus to silver

805
01:20:19.60 --> 01:20:25.28
spring metro station. Fortunately, there was a bus stop directly across from Lee's house.

806
01:20:25.28 --> 01:20:30.000
The trip to the National Archives took about 45 minutes on public transportation, and the building

807
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.20
was opened by 8.45 a.m. I spent my mornings in the military reference branch of the archives

808
01:20:35.20 --> 01:20:42.40
on the 13th floor, looking through finding aids and filling out cards to request boxes from different

809
01:20:42.40 --> 01:20:47.92
collections of papers. Dozens of boxes would be pulled from the shelves, placed on cards and made

810
01:20:47.92 --> 01:20:52.80
available to me in the second floor reading room, which stayed open until 9 p.m. on Tuesdays,

811
01:20:52.80 --> 01:20:58.40
Thursdays, and Fridays. I was usually there in the afternoon and evenings scanning documents,

812
01:20:58.40 --> 01:21:03.84
tagging the ones that pertained into the Nanking Masterker, and zero-oxing them as quickly as possible.

813
01:21:06.16 --> 01:21:12.000
So she's digging deep into this book, doing massive amount of research, and, you know,

814
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.76
research back then was infinitely harder than it is now, because we have the internet.

815
01:21:17.76 --> 01:21:24.72
Now, as she began, she assembled all this information, and she was starting to speak about it,

816
01:21:24.72 --> 01:21:29.12
starting to write some articles about it before the book came out, and she was interviewed

817
01:21:29.12 --> 01:21:34.72
by the San Jose Mercury News, which was a big newspaper up in the South Bay area of, you know,

818
01:21:34.72 --> 01:21:40.88
the South Bay San Francisco, and when she got done with that interview, she started getting a little

819
01:21:40.88 --> 01:21:48.80
bit of recognition. So here's a letter to her mom. Dear mom, here's the latest exciting news.

820
01:21:48.80 --> 01:21:53.84
I shall be the Master of Ceremony's for what I believe will be the biggest rape of Nanking

821
01:21:53.84 --> 01:21:59.04
Conference ever. The event will take place at Stanford University. During the first weekend of

822
01:21:59.04 --> 01:22:03.84
December, hundreds of people from more than 50 activists or organizations all over the globe will

823
01:22:03.84 --> 01:22:08.72
be there, as well as representatives from all major news, media, organizations of California,

824
01:22:08.72 --> 01:22:14.40
China, and Japan. The goal of the three-day affairs to discuss legal strategy, how can we see

825
01:22:14.40 --> 01:22:21.20
seek reparations for the victims through international law and UN resolutions? How can we gather evidence

826
01:22:21.20 --> 01:22:26.96
of atrocity for atrocities for lawsuits? What methods should we use to force the Japanese

827
01:22:26.96 --> 01:22:35.76
to accept responsibility for its past misdeeds? So, she's in the game. She's getting after it.

828
01:22:35.76 --> 01:22:42.48
She's starting to get some leadership positions in here, and starting to get some recognition.

829
01:22:43.52 --> 01:22:48.24
Now, as she continues to work, here's another letter to her mom, Dear mom. Thank you for your

830
01:22:48.24 --> 01:22:53.04
inspirational email. I've been working on my book all week and feel more confident about my material.

831
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.08
The sections of the book are so short that I organize each chapter as I would a speech.

832
01:22:58.08 --> 01:23:05.52
Thinking of the chapters as speeches forces me to distill each idea into a tiny, hard gem.

833
01:23:07.92 --> 01:23:12.96
Lately, I've been reading so many of the world's classic speeches for inspiration.

834
01:23:13.52 --> 01:23:18.88
They are breathtaking in their power and so much more pungent than prose. In the evenings,

835
01:23:19.52 --> 01:23:24.40
when I read the speeches of Napoleon or Clarence Darrell or Winston Churchill,

836
01:23:24.40 --> 01:23:32.56
I feel engaged in actual conversation with them. Words are the only way to preserve the essence

837
01:23:32.56 --> 01:23:39.52
of a soul. What excites me about speeches is that even after the speakers are dead and buried,

838
01:23:39.52 --> 01:23:48.08
their spirit lives on. To me, this is true religion, the best form of life after death.

839
01:23:48.08 --> 01:23:55.20
This is the first time I've ever devoted much attention to speeches. My previous reading

840
01:23:55.20 --> 01:24:03.36
had only consisted mainly of essays, plays, novels and poetry. Love, Iris. So it's pretty cool that

841
01:24:03.36 --> 01:24:09.36
you, first of all, I love that letter because she's recognizing the power of speech and she's

842
01:24:09.36 --> 01:24:14.88
realizing that what she's doing as an author is that's her, that's her, that's her mark that she's

843
01:24:14.88 --> 01:24:19.92
going to leave on the world. And it's very interesting that Ying Ying Chang is also an academic.

844
01:24:19.92 --> 01:24:25.12
She's obviously a really smart person and they're able to have these sort of intellectual conversations

845
01:24:25.12 --> 01:24:33.60
and letters and they're all a really good insight into what Iris is mind. What was going

846
01:24:33.60 --> 01:24:43.28
through Iris's mind as she did this. Now, the book comes out. It doesn't like jump out of the gates,

847
01:24:43.28 --> 01:24:46.88
but as it comes out, there's a little bit of a controversy about it and it's going to start

848
01:24:46.88 --> 01:24:50.48
to be some articles about it and some interviews and she's getting some interviews and the book

849
01:24:50.48 --> 01:24:56.96
starts to get some good traction. Back to the book, on January 14th, she flew to Washington for a TV

850
01:24:56.96 --> 01:25:04.40
interview with PBS. At the San Francisco Airport, she left a telephone message for us and said that

851
01:25:04.40 --> 01:25:10.40
she got an call from her publisher and that her book was number 15 on the New York Times best sellers

852
01:25:10.40 --> 01:25:15.12
list. Her voice told us she was weeping. I'm sure they were tears of joy.

853
01:25:16.16 --> 01:25:23.20
Shou Jen, which is the dad and I were jubilant. We could not contain our excitement for many days.

854
01:25:23.20 --> 01:25:30.24
In the next phone call, we said, Iris, you've made it. So, book hits the New York Times best

855
01:25:30.24 --> 01:25:37.60
seller. That's the game changer for Iris back to the book. On January 28th, Iris called us with

856
01:25:37.60 --> 01:25:44.88
excitement and said that Laurel Cook, her publicist and Jack McEwen of the CEO, had called her

857
01:25:44.88 --> 01:25:49.36
in the afternoon to tell her that her book was up to number 11 on the New York Times list.

858
01:25:49.36 --> 01:25:54.32
Her high-esspot yet, only two weeks after first making the list. When they called,

859
01:25:54.32 --> 01:25:59.52
she could hear wild cheering, whistling and clapping in the background. She was overjoyed.

860
01:26:00.72 --> 01:26:07.36
So, it's like the big thing is as a writer to make the New York Times list and her parents

861
01:26:07.36 --> 01:26:12.64
understand that too because they're academics and they're super stoked for Iris.

862
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:21.20
Now, with the success starts to come some stress and that starts to reveal itself.

863
01:26:22.24 --> 01:26:28.40
Here's another letter that she wrote. Dear mom, I'm sorry that I sounded so rushed when

864
01:26:28.40 --> 01:26:33.92
you called me at Mirion's home. Sometimes I wonder if I've offended a lot of old friends in the last

865
01:26:33.92 --> 01:26:40.16
few months by not returning emails, phone calls and letters. Perhaps many people believe I've been

866
01:26:40.16 --> 01:26:47.76
corrupted already. It's true that I've neglected my loved ones for the last few months. I feel

867
01:26:47.76 --> 01:26:54.08
ashamed that I haven't yet brought you a mother's day gift or even a card. Only this note that I'm

868
01:26:54.08 --> 01:26:58.88
hastily writing for my laptop computer perched up on a bed and Diana Zekerman's house.

869
01:26:58.88 --> 01:27:06.64
How I wish you could have been there during the woman of the year ceremony. I told you,

870
01:27:06.64 --> 01:27:11.28
I told the audience how you inspired me over the years, how you served as my first role model.

871
01:27:11.28 --> 01:27:17.12
So, you've got another big award, a woman of the year. Please forgive me. I love you dearly,

872
01:27:17.12 --> 01:27:22.48
even though I haven't found the time to talk to you in the last few weeks. And in a few weeks,

873
01:27:22.48 --> 01:27:28.96
well, I'll be reunited and the book tour will finally be over. I feel like a soldier returning from a

874
01:27:28.96 --> 01:27:37.84
six month war. Love Iris. So, she's a person that feels guilt, you know, and the idea that she

875
01:27:37.84 --> 01:27:42.40
hasn't been returned in emails and phone calls and she feels bad about it. And then I found

876
01:27:42.40 --> 01:27:46.88
this interesting perhaps many people believe I've been corrupted already. So, you made it big time

877
01:27:46.88 --> 01:27:55.92
and now you're blowing me off. She's feeling that pressure too. Back to the book, when Iris's

878
01:27:55.92 --> 01:28:01.12
book became an international bestseller, she reads to status most writers can only dream of

879
01:28:01.12 --> 01:28:09.12
she became a celebrity. But she also paid a price for it. In February 1998, after a long

880
01:28:09.12 --> 01:28:14.000
book tour, she'd already told us that once she came home, she did not want to go out anymore.

881
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.68
All she wanted to do was stay home with Brett, that was her husband, she'd been married now

882
01:28:19.68 --> 01:28:25.52
and have a good sleep. After several weeks of continuous book signings, public speeches,

883
01:28:25.52 --> 01:28:31.60
and traveling, she said, her life was a nonstop blur of airport, lecture hall, hotel, airport,

884
01:28:31.60 --> 01:28:37.36
lecture hall, hotel. The responses to her speeches were overwhelming, wherever she went,

885
01:28:37.36 --> 01:28:43.04
people besieged her after every speech. When she came home, she inevitably came down with a

886
01:28:43.04 --> 01:28:49.12
cold or a flu only to recover in time for the next book tour. She was physically exhausted.

887
01:28:50.64 --> 01:28:56.96
Not only that, but during the book signings, many old Asian people came up to her, Chinese,

888
01:28:56.96 --> 01:29:03.04
Korean, Filipino, Singaporean, Indian, they poured out their personal stories of suffering during

889
01:29:03.04 --> 01:29:09.36
World War II in Asia to her. Some of them were wept and thanked her for profusely,

890
01:29:09.36 --> 01:29:14.24
for writing such a book. They said it's so frustrating to see that Japan to this day hasn't

891
01:29:14.24 --> 01:29:19.76
formally acknowledged their war crimes. They exclaimed it's about time. I was said,

892
01:29:20.48 --> 01:29:25.44
all that on the one hand, she felt rewarded that she was sought out and greatly respected by many

893
01:29:25.44 --> 01:29:31.92
people, but on the other hand, she was mentally and emotionally drained after hearing those stories.

894
01:29:31.92 --> 01:29:39.52
On June 29, 1998, I was wrote, Dear Mom, I arrived safely in New York today after giving a

895
01:29:39.52 --> 01:29:46.64
well-received speech and Baltimore to the women doctors. Actually, it was very depressing.

896
01:29:47.60 --> 01:29:52.24
During the Q&A, a Pakistani doctor told the audience about the atrocities against Bengali,

897
01:29:52.24 --> 01:29:58.40
women in 1971. A Filipino doctor described how she escaped the rape of Manila when she was 12,

898
01:29:58.40 --> 01:30:04.80
and an Indian doctor had discussed the Indian tradition of Suti, which is the burning of widow's

899
01:30:04.80 --> 01:30:12.32
alive. Others talked about the international sex slave industry, the trafficking of women and

900
01:30:12.32 --> 01:30:19.92
children, female genital mutilation in Africa, you get the idea. It seemed there were endless

901
01:30:19.92 --> 01:30:31.68
gruesome stories that people weren't eager to share with her. On top of her busy schedule of book

902
01:30:31.68 --> 01:30:36.96
tours, outside people might not realize that besides her traveling, signings and books, and speeches,

903
01:30:36.96 --> 01:30:42.000
she was constantly bararded with additional email requests from news reporters for written interviews.

904
01:30:42.64 --> 01:30:46.88
Sometimes there were 10 or 15 written questions for her to answer, so the reporters could write a

905
01:30:46.88 --> 01:30:53.36
news article in profile. I risked to still could find time to answer those questions accordingly.

906
01:30:53.36 --> 01:30:58.56
So she's just a go-getter, right? She's not stopping regardless of what's happening.

907
01:30:59.52 --> 01:31:05.76
And now, as this book is gained all this popularity, now she's starting to get some attacks as

908
01:31:05.76 --> 01:31:09.44
well from, like I said, from the Japanese nationalists that are saying, oh, this didn't happen.

909
01:31:09.44 --> 01:31:14.40
You're glorifying it or you're making it sound like worse than it was. And here's the letter

910
01:31:14.40 --> 01:31:21.04
that you wrote, Dear Mom. Tonight I read an article about John Stomba, Stimebex life in the Lascato's

911
01:31:21.04 --> 01:31:26.48
Mountain area, and learned that the reception of the grapes of wrath mirrored that of the rape of

912
01:31:26.48 --> 01:31:34.40
Nanking. In a letter to a friend, Stimebex wrote, the vilification of me out here from the large landowners

913
01:31:34.40 --> 01:31:40.40
and bankers is pretty bad. The latest rumors started by them that the Oki's hate me for lying

914
01:31:40.40 --> 01:31:48.48
about them. So I'm frightened at the rolling might of this thing. It is completely out of hand.

915
01:31:49.12 --> 01:31:53.20
I mean, the kind of hysteria about the book is growing that is not healthy.

916
01:31:54.32 --> 01:31:59.84
Love Iris. So she feels the same way that she's starting to, this book is almost becoming

917
01:31:59.84 --> 01:32:08.48
more powerful than she, you know, more than she can control. And here's another letter that she wrote.

918
01:32:10.32 --> 01:32:16.40
A few nights ago, I leafed through Richard Rhodes autobiography, a hole in the world

919
01:32:17.04 --> 01:32:23.28
after I lunch together. As you know, Rhodes was starved, beaten, and psychologically

920
01:32:23.28 --> 01:32:30.32
abused as a child by his stepmother. His mother had committed suicide by shooting herself

921
01:32:30.32 --> 01:32:36.000
and his father degenerated into an alcoholic, leaving him virtually incapable of protecting his family.

922
01:32:36.72 --> 01:32:41.60
Every time I reread this book, I'm convinced that Richard Rhodes is lucky to be alive.

923
01:32:41.60 --> 01:32:48.32
He was a genuine victim, but even his experience pales and comparison to the stories of abandoned

924
01:32:48.32 --> 01:32:55.60
children in the PRC orphanages. That's people in public, China. I don't even want to get into that right now.

925
01:32:57.04 --> 01:33:03.04
Delving into history into other people's stories places all our problems into perspective.

926
01:33:04.24 --> 01:33:09.12
Time and again, we have to remind ourselves how extraordinarily lucky we are.

927
01:33:10.32 --> 01:33:12.000
Much love, Iris.

928
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:18.80
It clearly, that's something that I talk about on the regular basis. You look at the suffering

929
01:33:18.80 --> 01:33:24.32
that other people go through and it reminds you of how lucky we are not to be in those situations.

930
01:33:25.52 --> 01:33:29.52
But it seemed like Iris was having a hard time maintaining that.

931
01:33:30.80 --> 01:33:34.64
Positive outlook and she's keeps getting dragged down into the darkness.

932
01:33:34.64 --> 01:33:43.92
This is back to the book. Hearing that peanuts cartoonists, Charles Schultz had died.

933
01:33:43.92 --> 01:33:47.36
Iris was quite sentimental and wrote me a letter.

934
01:33:48.32 --> 01:33:53.28
And here's the letter, quote, dear mom, I have a favorite ask you. Can you save the last

935
01:33:53.28 --> 01:33:58.72
peanuts comic strip that appeared yesterday and mail it to me? I'm still reeling from the news

936
01:33:58.72 --> 01:34:06.000
of Charles Schultz's death. It's the end of an era. I still remember all the hours I spent

937
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.24
reading peanuts books as a child. Do you recall the time we went together to a garage

938
01:34:10.24 --> 01:34:15.76
stale and champagne and you brought me my first Snoopy cartoon book, a used paper back already yellow

939
01:34:15.76 --> 01:34:21.44
with age? That's when I first fell in love with the peanuts comics strip. You and Dad grew up with

940
01:34:21.44 --> 01:34:26.80
the peanuts cartoon as well. And Chinese newspapers and Taiwan making both of you part of the

941
01:34:26.80 --> 01:34:34.40
peanuts era as well. Years later in Santa Barbara, I met Charles Schultz in person at the SB

942
01:34:34.40 --> 01:34:39.28
Riders Conference. During his lecture, however, I was surprised by his demeanor, which was

943
01:34:39.28 --> 01:34:46.24
bitter, gloomy and depressed almost nasty. After his lecture, I stood in a long line waiting

944
01:34:46.24 --> 01:34:51.28
for Schultz to autograph a copy of his book. When I finally stood in front of him, I asked Schultz

945
01:34:51.28 --> 01:34:55.28
if I could write a profile about him for the New Yorker or some other major magazine.

946
01:34:55.28 --> 01:35:00.56
Why is a young person like you interested in an old man like me was his response?

947
01:35:01.60 --> 01:35:05.84
At the time, I thought he was being sarcastic, but later I learned that Schultz,

948
01:35:06.32 --> 01:35:12.24
like Charlie Brown, is a terribly insecure person, fundamentally convinced of his own unworthiness.

949
01:35:13.68 --> 01:35:19.36
That was the last time I ever spoke. I ever saw Schultz. But last year, I had one more opportunity

950
01:35:19.36 --> 01:35:24.24
to see him. To make a long story short, I didn't have time to make the long two-hour drive to Santa

951
01:35:24.24 --> 01:35:28.40
Rose, and I figured I would see Schultz at the next Santa Barbara's Riders Conference.

952
01:35:28.40 --> 01:35:32.96
I never expected that Schultz would pass away only a few months later.

953
01:35:34.16 --> 01:35:40.16
Do you think Charles Schultz committed suicide? Don't you find it odd that he died the night before

954
01:35:40.16 --> 01:35:46.32
his final strip ran in the Sunday newspaper? As you know, the peanuts ran from 1950 to 2000,

955
01:35:46.32 --> 01:35:54.40
a perfect 50 years. And he died right when the strip ended. But life is seldom as neat and tidy

956
01:35:54.40 --> 01:35:59.04
as a cartoon box. It's almost as if he timed his dramatic exit from this world,

957
01:35:59.60 --> 01:36:04.16
achieving his final deadline. Love, Iris.

958
01:36:07.28 --> 01:36:13.12
Continue gone. It seems like Iris could not get the death of Charles Schultz off her mind.

959
01:36:13.12 --> 01:36:18.000
The next day she wrote, to me again about him, dear mom, I think it was Charles Schultz's

960
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.28
pessimism, as well as the ability to understand human failure in security, heartbreak that made

961
01:36:23.28 --> 01:36:29.52
millions love peanuts. You're absolutely right, Schultz had no reason whatsoever to be depressed

962
01:36:29.52 --> 01:36:35.68
after achieving wealth and fame at such an early age. But the pression is not rational.

963
01:36:36.64 --> 01:36:40.96
Perhaps he did have a mental problem or some chemically induced condition, but whatever it was,

964
01:36:40.96 --> 01:36:48.08
it prevented him from losing touch with the underdogs of the world. It's strange. But I still feel

965
01:36:48.08 --> 01:36:52.72
avoid in my heart after Schultz's death, even though I never knew him and didn't particularly

966
01:36:52.72 --> 01:36:59.04
like him after our meeting in person. It made me wonder, what is the secret to Schultz's magic appeal?

967
01:37:00.56 --> 01:37:06.48
The answer, I believe, is simple. Schultz understands a heart of a loser. He capture those

968
01:37:06.48 --> 01:37:18.24
moments in life when we feel utterly unloved, unwanted and alone. All of us, no matter how successful,

969
01:37:18.24 --> 01:37:27.84
have felt like losers at some point in life. Love, Iris. So we start to see there's a

970
01:37:29.76 --> 01:37:35.76
an indication, right? There's an indication she's sort of seeing things like depression in other

971
01:37:35.76 --> 01:37:41.28
people, regardless of how successful they are at this point. She's a New York Times best seller,

972
01:37:41.28 --> 01:37:46.40
woman of the year, all this other stuff. So she's successful. And yet she's recognizing how that

973
01:37:46.40 --> 01:37:57.36
doesn't really mean anything and you can still be depressed. After September 11th, 2001,

974
01:37:57.36 --> 01:38:04.96
she wrote this on a few days after it, she wrote this again to her mom and dad in this case.

975
01:38:05.84 --> 01:38:12.48
Quote, events are unfolding faster than I can react to them. First, the WTC and Pentagon

976
01:38:12.48 --> 01:38:17.92
tragedies, then the Japanese prime minister's unexpected apology to the comfort of women and now

977
01:38:17.92 --> 01:38:23.36
a major court victory of a former Korean slave labor against the Japanese corporation.

978
01:38:23.36 --> 01:38:29.76
This week, I tried to work on my book and recover from general exhaustion and a mild case of

979
01:38:29.76 --> 01:38:36.16
the flu, but I have to admit it's hard to stay focused. I plan to do nothing more than right,

980
01:38:36.16 --> 01:38:42.96
exercise and rest for the next few weeks. Love, Iris. So she's now working on her next book,

981
01:38:43.60 --> 01:38:50.40
still working hard, probably working too hard, not focusing enough. And her mom, now she's got a

982
01:38:50.40 --> 01:38:56.08
kid as well. And we know that adding a kid into the mix doesn't give you more free time. We can promise

983
01:38:56.08 --> 01:39:05.44
you that. And she's married. Now she has a son and her mom actually started putting some

984
01:39:05.44 --> 01:39:10.000
pressure on her and said, hey, you got a kid now, you got to spend maybe you're going a little

985
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:17.60
overboard with the work back to the book on October 3rd, 2003, and an email I asked Iris

986
01:39:17.60 --> 01:39:21.84
whether she was putting too much emphasis on her career placing her career before her family.

987
01:39:21.84 --> 01:39:27.44
She replied, that is not true. It's just that I believe that I have some power to shape my destiny

988
01:39:27.44 --> 01:39:33.20
and I want Christopher. That's the son. I want Christopher to have his mother a strong,

989
01:39:33.20 --> 01:39:38.88
to have in his mother a strong role model, a person who is his own individual, impervious to the

990
01:39:38.88 --> 01:39:45.12
whims of others. I cannot teach Christopher to be an intellectual and a socially responsible

991
01:39:45.12 --> 01:39:50.72
person, unless I demonstrate to him through my actions that I myself am such a person. I want to

992
01:39:50.72 --> 01:39:58.72
teach Christopher that it is far better to be long to the critical minority than the unquestioning

993
01:39:58.72 --> 01:40:05.36
majority. I want to teach him the ability to think independently to evaluate ideas and information

994
01:40:05.36 --> 01:40:10.72
on his own without the official sanction of the authorities and if possible to create.

995
01:40:10.72 --> 01:40:17.84
These qualities are not universally popular in our society. My tendency to stand alone apart from

996
01:40:17.84 --> 01:40:24.40
the crowd has caused me a great pain and suffering throughout my life. But in the end,

997
01:40:24.40 --> 01:40:27.28
I am stronger and better person because of it.

998
01:40:27.28 --> 01:40:40.96
Now, she's continued on and she's continued to just kind of grind and grind and grind and

999
01:40:41.76 --> 01:40:54.48
there's an incident. She's gone on a trip to Louisville, Kentucky and things start going sideways

1000
01:40:54.48 --> 01:40:58.72
back to the book. That night, we went to sleep and assumed that Iris would be all right. But

1001
01:40:58.72 --> 01:41:04.56
about 2am, California time in the early morning of Friday, August 13th, we were awakened by a phone call.

1002
01:41:05.36 --> 01:41:09.52
I picked the phone and it was Iris. Her voice was shaking and she told me she'd seen some

1003
01:41:09.52 --> 01:41:15.12
frightening pictures on the TV and her hotel room. Iris and I then had a conversation about this.

1004
01:41:15.12 --> 01:41:19.68
Apparently she could not fall asleep so she turned on the TV. I asked her what kind of pictures

1005
01:41:19.68 --> 01:41:24.72
were on the TV screen. She said it showed some horrible atrocities and ugly images of children

1006
01:41:24.72 --> 01:41:31.04
torn apart by wars. She said that the TV was showing something similar to scenes from hell,

1007
01:41:31.04 --> 01:41:37.20
like an unimaginable world war 3. She had turned off their TV, waited a while, and then

1008
01:41:37.20 --> 01:41:43.28
turned it on again to find the ugly images had disappeared. I responded that maybe the TV had

1009
01:41:43.28 --> 01:41:47.28
been showing a war movie. It's very possible I said that during the wee hours of the night TV

1010
01:41:47.28 --> 01:41:54.000
stations would show such a genre of horror films. Then Iris told me she did not feel

1011
01:41:54.64 --> 01:41:59.60
things had been quite right from the very moment she'd arrived at the hotel. The clerk at

1012
01:41:59.60 --> 01:42:05.60
the front desk looks suspicious to her and spoke to a person who later kept looking at the window

1013
01:42:05.60 --> 01:42:11.36
of her room. While Iris was still talking with me on the phone, she told me that she could still

1014
01:42:11.36 --> 01:42:16.96
see that person standing outside on the lawn and not far from her room. He looked at her window

1015
01:42:16.96 --> 01:42:23.68
and as she peered through her curtain. She told me she's specter her room was wired and that

1016
01:42:23.68 --> 01:42:29.68
what she had seen on TV was real and intentionally shown to threaten her. So she's getting paranoid.

1017
01:42:30.24 --> 01:42:35.36
She's paranoid that Japanese nationalists are coming after her and it's starting to affect her

1018
01:42:35.36 --> 01:42:40.48
mind. Back to the book it was past 5 a.m. in Kentucky. I asked her had she gotten any sleep at all.

1019
01:42:40.48 --> 01:42:45.28
She said she couldn't fall asleep and she was exhausted and had a terrible headache. She was sick

1020
01:42:45.28 --> 01:42:51.04
I could tell. She had to be ill because she had not been able to sleep for three or four days prior to

1021
01:42:51.04 --> 01:42:56.72
the trip. She also had not eaten nor she drunk any liquid for some time. She said she'd ordered

1022
01:42:56.72 --> 01:43:01.84
some takeout dinner that was delivered to her room but she did not have any appetite and had

1023
01:43:01.84 --> 01:43:07.60
eaten anything. She didn't want to drink anything either afraid that someone might poison her.

1024
01:43:07.60 --> 01:43:19.28
I knew that under severe sleep deprivation people could have delusions. So her parents decided they're

1025
01:43:19.28 --> 01:43:24.000
going to fly well she has a breakdown and they get a call saying hey something happened to Iris

1026
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:30.000
you need to get out here they fly out to Louisville as soon as they get to Louisville they go to

1027
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.64
a hospital when she gets to when they get to a hospital they go to find her and she's in the psychiatric

1028
01:43:36.64 --> 01:43:42.40
unit and they she sent the psychiatric unit because they hadn't found anything wrong with her

1029
01:43:42.40 --> 01:43:47.52
physically which you know would include in my opinion that includes like she's not dehydrated

1030
01:43:47.52 --> 01:43:54.000
she's not starving she's got some psychiatric issues. So back to the book in the evening the

1031
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.96
doctor finally came in and met with us. He briefed us on Iris's condition in front of all of us.

1032
01:43:58.96 --> 01:44:04.48
He believed Iris had experienced a so-called brief reactive psychosis due to stress conditions

1033
01:44:04.48 --> 01:44:11.76
such as lack of sleep and food. He added that her condition could also be a possible onset of

1034
01:44:11.76 --> 01:44:18.08
bipolar disorder and recommended that Iris he had doctor for follow-up after her return home. He gave

1035
01:44:18.08 --> 01:44:28.000
us a reference. He also prescribed an anti-psychotic drug, respiratory, respiratory, two milligrams a day

1036
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:37.12
for Iris to take for at least a year and then they they getting the cab and as she's getting the

1037
01:44:37.12 --> 01:44:42.16
cab she's kind of like making statements and saying strange things about what she sees billboard

1038
01:44:42.16 --> 01:44:48.72
she's making strange comments about them and finally they landed San Jose Airport and go back to the

1039
01:44:48.72 --> 01:44:55.04
book we called Michael and that's that's the son or Iris's brother we called Michael to come pick us up

1040
01:44:55.04 --> 01:44:59.68
while we were waiting for Michael I resed that she felt dizzy and had a headache she told me that

1041
01:44:59.68 --> 01:45:04.48
things seemed distorted to her and that the expressions of people around her were strange.

1042
01:45:05.36 --> 01:45:10.96
At that time we did not know how powerful psychiatric drugs were and thought that Iris's behavior

1043
01:45:10.96 --> 01:45:16.40
was strange. I later realized that while in the hospital Iris had been given heavy doses of

1044
01:45:16.40 --> 01:45:22.72
risk-bredal and a tranquilizer calmer down the side effects of psychiatric drugs could be severe

1045
01:45:22.72 --> 01:45:27.52
that explained why she felt dizzy and had a headache and distortion of a visual perception.

1046
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:38.96
So she's now on these drugs she's she's taking the the the whispered raw two milligrams a day

1047
01:45:38.96 --> 01:45:46.48
the medicines making her super sleepy and once they're back in the bay area the mom

1048
01:45:46.48 --> 01:45:54.08
yinging starts looking for a you know board certified psychiatrist to bring her to and she ends up with

1049
01:45:54.08 --> 01:46:00.80
this guy that they called doctor B. Back to the book Iris is now seeing doctor B once a week and she

1050
01:46:00.80 --> 01:46:08.80
persuaded him to reduce her dosage of risk-bredal risk-bredal by half from one milligrams or from

1051
01:46:08.80 --> 01:46:15.84
two one milligrams from from two down to one from the very beginning Iris did not like to take

1052
01:46:15.84 --> 01:46:21.36
any drugs and she kept trying to reduce the dosage or stop it entirely. The rest of the family

1053
01:46:21.36 --> 01:46:28.72
was hoping that with the risk-bredal Iris would be less depressed but to no avail there was no difference.

1054
01:46:28.72 --> 01:46:33.20
So interestingly Iris is saying I don't want to take this drug you know I want to get off of it

1055
01:46:33.20 --> 01:46:42.32
and they're all saying look just keep taking it and eventually he describes her with another

1056
01:46:42.32 --> 01:46:48.64
drug which is called amplify and as soon as her back to the book as soon as Iris took the

1057
01:46:48.64 --> 01:46:53.84
amplify 10 milligrams she became excessively sleepy she could sleep for 12 hours or more

1058
01:46:53.84 --> 01:47:01.60
straight. So now she's sleeping I mean 12 hours a day bad and back to the book Iris felt that her

1059
01:47:01.60 --> 01:47:06.80
illness and inability to take care of Christopher was a burden to everyone something she hated.

1060
01:47:06.80 --> 01:47:13.60
I could see that she was very sad and felt helpless. So this continues on and finally they go

1061
01:47:13.60 --> 01:47:19.52
back to a meeting with Dr. B. Dr. B. Stundesol with what he said next and a very serious tone he said

1062
01:47:19.52 --> 01:47:25.20
he thought Iris's condition was very grave and he suggested that Iris check into a recovery facility.

1063
01:47:25.20 --> 01:47:30.000
He said that the facility was in in Salt Suledo near the beach it was quite ideal for mental

1064
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.12
patients to recuperate as soon as Iris heard that she immediately showed her disapproval I could

1065
01:47:35.12 --> 01:47:40.08
understand her suspicion of any facility designed for so-called mental patients. She had learned

1066
01:47:40.08 --> 01:47:46.80
many historical instances of government persecution of political dissidents one way was to put those

1067
01:47:46.80 --> 01:47:52.000
dissidents into mental institutions and abused them sometimes leading to death. I did not blame her

1068
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.60
for her suspicions she was already suspecting that evil forces were at work against her for what

1069
01:47:57.60 --> 01:48:04.24
she had written and done in the name of justice. Dr. B. She told Dr. B that she did not think her

1070
01:48:04.24 --> 01:48:10.72
mental state was that bad and that she didn't need to go to recovery facility. So they started

1071
01:48:10.72 --> 01:48:21.12
looking for someone else to take her to besides Dr. B and now she gets prescribed another drug

1072
01:48:21.12 --> 01:48:32.88
which is called Selexa and so she's on Alexa and she's on Abul Fai and back to the book at this

1073
01:48:32.88 --> 01:48:38.56
time, sorry, a billify. At this time Iris was already experiencing the strong side effects of

1074
01:48:38.56 --> 01:48:43.20
a billify. Most obvious were her lack of energy and the fact that she was drowsy all the time. In

1075
01:48:43.20 --> 01:48:46.88
addition when she woke up from her daily naps, she complained that her shoulders and leg joints

1076
01:48:46.88 --> 01:48:53.12
were sore which were new symptoms that she thought likely to have been caused by the drug. I was

1077
01:48:53.12 --> 01:48:59.28
worried about the side effects of a billify and voiced my concern to Dr. B. He said the dosage was

1078
01:48:59.28 --> 01:49:05.68
the lowest possible and that the side effects would gradually disappear. In retrospect, it appears to

1079
01:49:05.68 --> 01:49:11.60
us that a billify had a big impact on Iris's mental state. It was a turning point in her condition

1080
01:49:11.60 --> 01:49:19.76
became worse after she started taking a billify and later worse and even more with Selexa.

1081
01:49:23.04 --> 01:49:31.76
So now another incident takes place. She kind of disappears for a little bit. No one really knows

1082
01:49:31.76 --> 01:49:40.16
where she is. They call the cops to find out eventually. She calls back and she says, hey, look,

1083
01:49:40.16 --> 01:49:46.08
I was out. I was tired. I checked into a hotel to get some sleep. That's the story she tells.

1084
01:49:46.08 --> 01:49:53.12
And her mom says she sounds guilty as she's trying to tell this story. And then a few days later,

1085
01:49:53.12 --> 01:50:02.16
they find the sleeping pills and a bottle of vodka and they're kind of realized that she

1086
01:50:03.44 --> 01:50:08.64
was thinking about committing suicide but her mom says she probably is going to do a room to do

1087
01:50:08.64 --> 01:50:16.32
that and fell asleep. When she woke up, I guess she changed her mind. And back to the book here

1088
01:50:16.32 --> 01:50:21.52
on the drugs that she was taken, we now know that a billify website warns that the drug can affect

1089
01:50:21.52 --> 01:50:26.96
your judgment, thinking or motor skills as well as the side effects of increasing risk of suicide,

1090
01:50:26.96 --> 01:50:34.24
drowsiness, anxiety and muscle stiffness. And the Selexa website warns about suicide, anxiety

1091
01:50:34.24 --> 01:50:42.32
and self-destructive or aggressive impulses. So these drugs that you take for these problems have

1092
01:50:42.32 --> 01:50:50.72
side effects that sound worse than what the problem is. Then she goes on to say that the first attempt

1093
01:50:50.72 --> 01:50:57.60
to suicide that she made, so this the temple was when she was on 10 milligrams of a billify.

1094
01:50:57.60 --> 01:51:04.56
And the other thing that that mentions in these about these drugs is that when you change

1095
01:51:04.56 --> 01:51:10.16
prescription and when you change doses or you go on or off of them, that's when you're most vulnerable.

1096
01:51:11.12 --> 01:51:16.16
And so that suicide attempt was in line with one of those changes.

1097
01:51:16.16 --> 01:51:28.56
So they go back to, now they're with another doctor, doctor who they call doctor C.

1098
01:51:30.56 --> 01:51:34.96
Going back to the book, I restopped taking Selexa on October 7th after the support group meeting.

1099
01:51:34.96 --> 01:51:38.64
She told Dr. Sele on the phone that she would discontinue seeing him if he insisted on

1100
01:51:38.64 --> 01:51:44.08
her taking the medicine. As a compromised doctor C persuaded her to continue seeing him and then

1101
01:51:44.08 --> 01:51:49.04
he would decide whether she could gradually decrease the dosage of whispered all which she was still

1102
01:51:49.04 --> 01:51:54.40
on. All of us told Iris that both the medication and the psychotherapy sessions were needed

1103
01:51:54.40 --> 01:52:00.24
for rapid recovery. If she didn't want to take the medication, then at least she should have

1104
01:52:00.24 --> 01:52:06.08
psychotherapy sessions with the doctor. She agreed to continue seeing Dr. C looking back at what

1105
01:52:06.08 --> 01:52:11.44
ended up happening. It was so ironic. Iris was the one who did not want to take the medication

1106
01:52:11.44 --> 01:52:16.08
whereas the rest of the family believed in doctors and thought the medication would help her.

1107
01:52:24.48 --> 01:52:28.56
Continuing on, the morning of Thursday, October 21st when I went to Selexa,

1108
01:52:28.56 --> 01:52:31.84
she was very unhappy and complained that I was following her too closely.

1109
01:52:33.04 --> 01:52:38.000
I found she had not eaten well the night before, so I suggested going out for lunch.

1110
01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:43.60
We drove to nearby restaurant. In the parking lot when she stopped the car, she sat there and told

1111
01:52:43.60 --> 01:52:51.28
me without any expression that she wanted to cry but had no tears. Her face was greenish and

1112
01:52:51.28 --> 01:52:56.96
an horrible depressed state. At this time, she had already mentioned that she did not want to live

1113
01:52:56.96 --> 01:53:02.32
anymore. I also noticed that her arm and leg movements and facial expressions were rigid

1114
01:53:02.32 --> 01:53:08.24
and it seemed even worse that she wanted to cry but had no tears.

1115
01:53:09.92 --> 01:53:16.88
Back then, I did not suspect that all these symptoms could be the serious side effects

1116
01:53:16.88 --> 01:53:18.16
of the medications.

1117
01:53:18.16 --> 01:53:35.68
Iris began to feel hopeless. I later realized. She wanted to carry out her plan and she did not

1118
01:53:35.68 --> 01:53:41.28
want us to find out. In the last week of her life, she prohibited me from visiting her.

1119
01:53:41.28 --> 01:53:49.20
She did not even want me to call her and did not return my calls or my emails. In that final

1120
01:53:49.20 --> 01:53:57.44
week, Shao Jin and I took a walk ourselves to ease our worries. I went to Apollo Altus support group

1121
01:53:57.44 --> 01:54:02.56
on Wednesday, November 3rd. Shao Jin and I went to another support group in San Jose on Friday,

1122
01:54:02.56 --> 01:54:08.64
November 5th. We tried to gather information on how to deal with the pressure and loved ones who

1123
01:54:08.64 --> 01:54:17.36
were possibly suicidal. For all this time, she was actively planning her final exit while we tried

1124
01:54:17.36 --> 01:54:25.60
to find a way to rescue her. We raised against her and we did not realize that she would carry out

1125
01:54:25.60 --> 01:54:41.52
her plan so quickly. One week later, on November 9th, she was gone.

1126
01:54:41.52 --> 01:54:56.72
And here is the note that was found next to Iris' computer. Dear Brett, mom, dad, and Mike.

1127
01:54:58.08 --> 01:55:03.68
For the last few weeks, I have been struggling with my decision as to whether I should live or die.

1128
01:55:03.68 --> 01:55:12.48
As I mentioned to Brett, when you believe you have a future, you think of terms of generations

1129
01:55:12.48 --> 01:55:22.88
and years. When you do not, you live just by the day. You live not just by the day, but by the minute.

1130
01:55:22.88 --> 01:55:32.80
You don't want someone who will live out the rest of her days as a mere shell of her former self.

1131
01:55:34.40 --> 01:55:41.12
I had considered running away, but I will never be able to escape from myself and my thoughts.

1132
01:55:43.12 --> 01:55:47.92
I am doing this because I am too weak to withstand the years of pain and agony ahead.

1133
01:55:47.92 --> 01:55:56.48
Each breath is becoming difficult for me to take. The anxiety can be compared to drowning in an

1134
01:55:56.48 --> 01:56:05.20
open sea. I know that my actions will transfer some of this pain to others, indeed those who love

1135
01:56:05.20 --> 01:56:17.12
me the most. Please forgive me. Forgive me because I cannot forgive myself.

1136
01:56:17.12 --> 01:56:31.84
Love, love, Iris.

1137
01:56:31.84 --> 01:56:47.84
And Iris's mom closes out the book saying it was an untimely death. Over the years, Iris had

1138
01:56:47.84 --> 01:56:53.20
always commented that life was too short for her to finish the things she wanted to accomplish.

1139
01:56:53.20 --> 01:57:00.24
She said many times that she wanted to write more books to make films and record more oral histories.

1140
01:57:02.08 --> 01:57:07.04
It was so painful to realize that many of her dreams were not fulfilled.

1141
01:57:08.88 --> 01:57:15.04
Yet it is not how she died, but rather how she lived that will be her legacy.

1142
01:57:16.96 --> 01:57:21.76
Whenever I think of Iris, the memories of a loving daughter and a beautiful soul

1143
01:57:21.76 --> 01:57:31.52
will always remain with me. In her short 36 years, she had inspired many, many people in the world

1144
01:57:31.52 --> 01:57:36.80
with her noble spirit, her passion, dedication, sincerity, and determination.

1145
01:57:38.32 --> 01:57:43.60
In preserving historical truth and pursuing justice for the voiceless victims.

1146
01:57:43.60 --> 01:57:50.08
Iris was a woman whose heartbeat passionately for those who suffered.

1147
01:57:51.52 --> 01:57:59.52
She was a woman who could not forget. She could not forget their agony and she refused

1148
01:57:59.52 --> 01:58:08.08
to let their stories go untold. Iris's life was short, but brilliant.

1149
01:58:08.08 --> 01:58:16.08
Like a splendid rainbow across the sky, one that the goddess she was named after would be proud of.

1150
01:58:16.08 --> 01:58:34.48
Iris's rainbow was magnificent, vanishing quickly.

1151
01:58:34.48 --> 01:58:47.44
A rainbow vanishing quickly.

1152
01:58:47.44 --> 01:58:58.24
And I guess that that is what we all are.

1153
01:59:02.40 --> 01:59:04.32
Parainbo vanishing quickly.

1154
01:59:04.32 --> 01:59:22.96
But before we vanish, I say, shine.

1155
01:59:22.96 --> 01:59:41.44
Shine. All that darkness in the world be the light, be the color, be the good and the strong

1156
01:59:41.44 --> 01:59:44.000
and the brightness that drives away the dark.

1157
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:52.64
We have one chance here.

1158
01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:02.40
One chance, one opportunity to stretch across the sky and shine.

1159
02:00:02.40 --> 02:00:25.68
Shine. Value that. Value that value life in no death a light will spread.

1160
02:00:25.68 --> 02:00:40.24
And good will prevail. It will prevail over evil so long as we stand up.

1161
02:00:43.36 --> 02:00:48.80
Stand up against all that wickedness in the world.

1162
02:00:48.80 --> 02:00:52.96
We stand up.

1163
02:00:58.80 --> 02:00:59.44
Shine.

1164
02:01:06.96 --> 02:01:13.60
And I think that's all I've got for tonight. Echo.

1165
02:01:13.60 --> 02:01:18.80
Yes. What you go ahead and take the mic for a minute there.

1166
02:01:21.04 --> 02:01:22.80
While I decompress it around the side.

1167
02:01:25.92 --> 02:01:30.40
I was stalking with Greg Trane yesterday.

1168
02:01:32.08 --> 02:01:37.60
And you can complain about something where you can't embrace.

1169
02:01:37.60 --> 02:01:39.60
This is one of the big things that I learned from you.

1170
02:01:39.60 --> 02:01:45.04
And when you look at your own situation, you can compare to other past situations that are way worse.

1171
02:01:47.04 --> 02:01:50.48
Your situation isn't that bad. That's what you start with.

1172
02:01:51.36 --> 02:01:58.32
Then you go on to my situation. These are small teeny tiny challenges that all you have to do is approach.

1173
02:02:00.72 --> 02:02:04.40
This way of embracing it.

1174
02:02:04.40 --> 02:02:08.96
You're feeling frustrated about your situation.

1175
02:02:08.96 --> 02:02:14.000
When you put in perspective, these are small challenges that you just got to overcome.

1176
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:19.44
You take it on as you want to put more work on my plate at work.

1177
02:02:19.44 --> 02:02:23.04
Because I can handle it. I'll do it the best and watch me work.

1178
02:02:24.32 --> 02:02:31.12
That is good. When we had Tim Ferriss on here.

1179
02:02:31.12 --> 02:02:34.64
And when I did Tim Ferriss interview the first time I was on his podcast.

1180
02:02:35.92 --> 02:02:37.92
It's the thing that I talked about when he came on here.

1181
02:02:38.48 --> 02:02:44.000
He asked the question, how close do you get to the darkness before it consumes you?

1182
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:53.04
I've talked about before. If you stare into the soul of a monster, you have to be careful because you might become a monster.

1183
02:02:53.04 --> 02:02:54.32
Yeah.

1184
02:02:54.32 --> 02:03:04.96
I think the drugs that she got put on Robach, in this world, when she saw was the bad.

1185
02:03:04.96 --> 02:03:08.88
I think that Tim Ferriss's point where he was saying to me,

1186
02:03:08.88 --> 02:03:13.44
how often should I get close to the darkness? How often should I look at that?

1187
02:03:15.12 --> 02:03:20.40
My response was in order to know the light, you got to know the darkness.

1188
02:03:20.40 --> 02:03:26.16
But you can absolutely go too far in that direction.

1189
02:03:26.16 --> 02:03:26.64
Yeah.

1190
02:03:26.64 --> 02:03:33.76
And you can say to yourself, wow, the world is evil and everyone's evil and underneath the surface.

1191
02:03:33.76 --> 02:03:37.20
Everyone can turn into this Imperial Japanese soldier and commit these atrocities.

1192
02:03:37.84 --> 02:03:43.20
And that is what you absolutely, I would say be careful.

1193
02:03:43.20 --> 02:03:46.56
I don't know if that's the right word. I guess it is the right word be careful.

1194
02:03:46.56 --> 02:03:51.44
But to me, what you have to do is you have to balance it. And to me, as an American, as a

1195
02:03:52.64 --> 02:03:59.20
there's so much good, right? I think that people generally get jaded to all the good that's out there.

1196
02:03:59.20 --> 02:04:02.000
And that's why I say hey, you know what? Look over here at the darkness.

1197
02:04:02.96 --> 02:04:07.92
But for someone that's stuck in a horrible place, in a horrible situation in life,

1198
02:04:08.56 --> 02:04:14.32
those folks got to look out and say, wait a second, there's not there's so much good out there.

1199
02:04:14.32 --> 02:04:18.72
You know, if you take a, like that's clearly, I mean, you look at, look at Iris Chang.

1200
02:04:18.72 --> 02:04:24.96
I mean, she is smart and successful and beautiful and well-liked and had a good, she came up with

1201
02:04:24.96 --> 02:04:31.44
an amazing family. Her parents were a dordor, right? She had everything in her life was good,

1202
02:04:31.44 --> 02:04:36.24
right? And she lost all that. You know what? It's like, if you talk to anybody that flies

1203
02:04:36.24 --> 02:04:42.24
planes, right? If you go into a cloud, you lose your orientation. It happens in diving too.

1204
02:04:42.24 --> 02:04:46.96
It happens when you're surfing. If you fall off a big wave and you're getting rolled around,

1205
02:04:46.96 --> 02:04:53.76
sometimes it can be hard to tell which way is up, right? It can happen. You know, guys drive their

1206
02:04:53.76 --> 02:04:57.20
airplanes, they get lost in a cloud, they drive their airplanes into a mountain or they drive it into

1207
02:04:57.20 --> 02:05:02.24
the ground because they don't, they get disoriented and they lose sight of which way is up and

1208
02:05:02.24 --> 02:05:06.88
you or your underwater and you lose sight of which way is up. That's what you have to watch out for.

1209
02:05:06.88 --> 02:05:11.12
You got to be able to say, wait a second, if everything is black around me,

1210
02:05:11.12 --> 02:05:18.72
okay, stop. Let me get oriented. Let me, let me check my control panel in the water. It's

1211
02:05:18.72 --> 02:05:23.28
really easy. You got to look for bubbles, which way are the bubbles? The bubbles are going to go up.

1212
02:05:24.16 --> 02:05:28.000
And so when you get trapped in that darkness, these people end up in these situations where

1213
02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:34.32
everything looks black, stop. You're disoriented. You just can't see. You don't know the right

1214
02:05:34.32 --> 02:05:39.76
direction. It's okay. Figure out where the bubbles are. They're going to go to the surface and

1215
02:05:39.76 --> 02:05:42.16
when they get to the surface, there's going to be light and you're going to be okay.

1216
02:05:44.16 --> 02:05:51.04
Obviously, Iris, she got trapped. Drag down and disoriented in the darkness and she couldn't figure

1217
02:05:51.04 --> 02:05:56.88
out that she had a husband and a son and a family and a money and she had all these beautiful

1218
02:05:56.88 --> 02:06:02.40
things in her life. Yeah, which a lot of times especially if you go full speed in that direction,

1219
02:06:02.40 --> 02:06:07.60
where you don't know which way is up. So you're going down. Even the good things that come in,

1220
02:06:07.60 --> 02:06:12.72
you know, even, you know, when you get paranoid, something good and you're like, that's bad.

1221
02:06:12.72 --> 02:06:18.24
For instance, for instance, she's on a trip in Louisville, going to go do your speech or whatever,

1222
02:06:18.24 --> 02:06:21.92
and someone's checking her in the hotel. Maybe someone was saying, oh, I think that's Iris Chang.

1223
02:06:21.92 --> 02:06:25.44
I saw her in TV. And instead, she's thinking, oh, it's some nationalists that are coming to

1224
02:06:25.44 --> 02:06:30.72
get me. So yeah, she was absolutely. So that's something that I think and it's something that for

1225
02:06:30.72 --> 02:06:36.000
those of us that are not in that situation, how do you pay attention and observe people and make

1226
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.80
sure that your friends or people you know or people that are in bad situations? How do you make

1227
02:06:40.80 --> 02:06:45.44
sure that they're getting enough that they know how to orient themselves and get back to the

1228
02:06:45.44 --> 02:06:50.08
surface and get away from all that horribleness. When you approach thing and I was talking to Greg,

1229
02:06:50.08 --> 02:06:54.88
that's kind of what, and this just reminded me of it. When you approach things like that, you,

1230
02:06:54.88 --> 02:06:58.80
you know how like you said, you're going down. If you don't know which way is up, you're going down.

1231
02:06:58.80 --> 02:07:03.28
A good thing, you're going to look at, that's a bad thing. Reenforcing my whole direction, by the way.

1232
02:07:03.28 --> 02:07:09.44
So if you approach it in a way where things that even would be frustrating to like an everyday

1233
02:07:09.44 --> 02:07:15.68
person, if you approach it like good, you know, I'm the one to do this thing, bring the challenge

1234
02:07:15.68 --> 02:07:20.80
because the challenge is a good, you know, that's the approach that'll reinforce that way of thinking.

1235
02:07:20.80 --> 02:07:25.36
Yes. So yes. You will be going, you know, and really when you explore darkness,

1236
02:07:27.12 --> 02:07:31.44
that's not to embrace the darkness and be dark. Like I said, don't become the

1237
02:07:31.44 --> 02:07:36.16
that's basically your trend of way ignorance. That's what you're doing. Yeah. Because you got no dark

1238
02:07:36.16 --> 02:07:42.40
and it's your contrast. It's a contrast. You can see, okay, guess what? In, for this case, I mean,

1239
02:07:42.40 --> 02:07:47.52
obviously, I pray I never have to read anything as heinous as that again and we're on the show.

1240
02:07:48.48 --> 02:07:55.84
But that happened. Yeah. Right. That happened. Yeah. That happened. We should not. You shouldn't go

1241
02:07:55.84 --> 02:08:03.68
through life and not realize that that happened. Yeah. That happened to you, that human being said,

1242
02:08:03.68 --> 02:08:10.88
that the other human being is horrible as it is. You need to realize that that is a part of our

1243
02:08:10.88 --> 02:08:17.36
human history. So that way you can say, you recognize and say, okay, this can happen.

1244
02:08:17.36 --> 02:08:29.68
And we need to watch out for it. And yeah. So look out for your friends, keep them knowing that

1245
02:08:29.68 --> 02:08:34.88
there's, keep them knowing which direction they're heading in and you see someone going sideways

1246
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.76
bring them grab them. Especially with the, I mean, this is kind of a specific to this story, but the

1247
02:08:41.76 --> 02:08:47.68
the drugs, you know, when you take Medicaid, because that's a big one man, you can mess up your

1248
02:08:47.68 --> 02:08:52.40
pre, even like how you said when you get off the drugs, you know, because these are all chemical

1249
02:08:52.40 --> 02:08:58.72
things that you're made for certain things. For sure. So when that part goes sideways, you can't

1250
02:08:59.60 --> 02:09:04.16
like reason necessarily with someone, you know, they can't reason with you can't reason with

1251
02:09:04.16 --> 02:09:09.60
yourself, you know, stuff that would seem obvious. Hey, if I, you know, walk off this cliff,

1252
02:09:09.60 --> 02:09:13.84
it's obvious that's bad. It doesn't really work that way. If like your chemicals are off

1253
02:09:13.84 --> 02:09:18.88
definitely. So yeah, you kind of got to, you know, like look out for somebody if you can see that

1254
02:09:18.88 --> 02:09:26.000
happening. Yeah, no doubt. And it's very, it's very interesting. The, the mind is so incredibly

1255
02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:36.08
durable, but at the same time, it's just totally fragile and little, some little change to the,

1256
02:09:36.08 --> 02:09:40.08
to the composition or to the, to the chemicals that are in or to the fought patterns that are

1257
02:09:40.08 --> 02:09:49.68
in, you know, can be really drastic changes on a, on a person. Yeah, you ever have a real bad flu

1258
02:09:49.68 --> 02:09:58.56
and a fever in the neutral. Yeah, I have. You know, and it's almost like a mix between

1259
02:09:58.56 --> 02:10:04.000
dreaming hallucinating and like, because, man, it's like your thoughts are all jumbled up. Okay,

1260
02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:08.16
you want, you want to tell you an echo story right now? Yes. This will be a stupid echo story.

1261
02:10:08.16 --> 02:10:17.36
It's not a great story. So, so I was, like, 20, I was 23 years old or something. And I was doing

1262
02:10:17.36 --> 02:10:23.52
the dishes, speaking of doing the dishes. I was doing the dishes. And I turned on the water and I

1263
02:10:23.52 --> 02:10:29.92
didn't see what was happening, but this little stream, a tiny little stream of water had

1264
02:10:29.92 --> 02:10:36.08
broken through the pipe at some point in the handle and it, and it started to land on my hand.

1265
02:10:36.08 --> 02:10:41.76
Well, I didn't know that it was water because it must have been like the similar temperature to

1266
02:10:41.76 --> 02:10:49.28
what my body was at the time. And so I see this and it looks for, for a quarter of a second,

1267
02:10:49.84 --> 02:10:55.36
it looks like my hand is blistering. It's just, and it's spreading so rapidly. And for a quarter

1268
02:10:55.36 --> 02:10:59.52
of a second, I thought to myself, I'm being attacked by chemical warfare and I'm going to die in

1269
02:10:59.52 --> 02:11:06.000
the next half a second. I'm dead. I think we were doing some chemical warfare training or whatever.

1270
02:11:06.32 --> 02:11:11.60
And so, at that moment, for about a half a second, I thought I'm about to die and it only lasted

1271
02:11:11.60 --> 02:11:17.20
about, then either it lasted as water, and I said, oh, yeah, it's not. But my point is that

1272
02:11:17.20 --> 02:11:22.64
mentally, yeah, what, if, you know, a different situation, I could get locked into that mode.

1273
02:11:22.64 --> 02:11:26.88
And when you see Iris going, hey, these people are coming after me. If you get mentally locked

1274
02:11:26.88 --> 02:11:32.80
in that mode and you start seeing things that are that, that, you start imposing or overlaying

1275
02:11:32.80 --> 02:11:39.52
your reality over actual reality. You start augmenting reality yourself. That gets really, really scary.

1276
02:11:39.52 --> 02:11:44.16
Yeah. Like when you think someone's mad at you, you're at that. You think someone's mad at you.

1277
02:11:44.16 --> 02:11:49.20
So you're looking for all the little clues, you know, Peng, is this person mad at him here?

1278
02:11:49.20 --> 02:11:54.000
Or are they not, and normal everyday stuff? You know, why didn't, why did she text me back

1279
02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:00.24
quickly? Yeah, well, I know. I know, usually she puts a smiley face, no smiley face this time.

1280
02:12:00.24 --> 02:12:03.92
You know, she hates you. Yeah, she's mad. I know, she's mad. Something's wrong.

1281
02:12:03.92 --> 02:12:07.52
But yeah, so yeah, if you have me and while they're like, well, I don't know what time you're talking

1282
02:12:07.52 --> 02:12:15.44
about. Yeah. Anyway, speaking of being mad or should I say the opposite of being mad. So

1283
02:12:15.44 --> 02:12:25.36
this is what you do. Take alpha brain alpha brainy. The pre workout performance and strength.

1284
02:12:24.72 --> 02:12:28.48
And go workout. See what happens. That will make the record report back. Yeah.

1285
02:12:29.52 --> 02:12:33.84
Actually, that's something Iris and her mom both referred to a couple of times here. They were like,

1286
02:12:34.40 --> 02:12:38.72
her mom would say, you know, I want to, I want you to go exercise with me. And I, you know,

1287
02:12:38.72 --> 02:12:43.28
I should have put that in the podcast, but but hey, get the book and read it yourself. I mean,

1288
02:12:43.28 --> 02:12:47.68
that's what you need to do. I should have said that earlier. The rap and anking absolutely, you

1289
02:12:47.68 --> 02:12:54.16
know, get it. Try and read it when you're in a happy place, right? Yeah. It's hard, hard read.

1290
02:12:54.16 --> 02:12:58.48
It's might be the hardest read of any read possible. I don't know what could be harder than that.

1291
02:12:59.44 --> 02:13:04.32
And then the book, the woman who could not forget by Yingying Chang, which again,

1292
02:13:04.32 --> 02:13:10.16
chronicles her life and it's a really beautiful story. And with, with obviously with a tragic ending,

1293
02:13:10.16 --> 02:13:16.24
and hopefully lessons learned from it, one of the lessons being be physically, be physically active.

1294
02:13:16.24 --> 02:13:20.64
And her mom was trying to get her to go to the gym with her and work out with her because there's no doubt.

1295
02:13:20.64 --> 02:13:26.64
It's, it's, it's, it's physiologically fact. Physiological fact. When you work out, you get

1296
02:13:26.64 --> 02:13:33.20
in door from your least, you feel better. 100%. Yeah. And it also, which is good. I just heard this on

1297
02:13:33.20 --> 02:13:42.40
a Jo-Royan, and Dr. Ronda Patrick, is there any? She was talking about how working out exercise

1298
02:13:43.28 --> 02:13:48.48
like is it is one of the more powerful anti-aging. Oh, for sure. So, you know, like when you get older,

1299
02:13:49.12 --> 02:13:54.16
you know, you know, Alzheimer's. Yeah, yeah, yeah, she said not for physically aging, but for mentally

1300
02:13:54.16 --> 02:13:59.44
mental aging. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, man, it's just all around good deal.

1301
02:13:59.44 --> 02:14:05.36
Brad, this is so one time, I think I even mentioned, no, I didn't mention this. So one time, I

1302
02:14:06.40 --> 02:14:12.88
I might have drank maybe the night before. This was like a few months ago. And I didn't work out for a while,

1303
02:14:12.88 --> 02:14:17.28
you know, I was like, you know, immersed in, I don't know, work out. Either way, I didn't work. It was,

1304
02:14:17.28 --> 02:14:22.32
no, no, I got sick, and then I got hurt. So, I can, you know. So you cured that with the bottle.

1305
02:14:24.08 --> 02:14:29.12
Don't do that. I'm not. I'm gonna make myself better. No, you're not actually. Yeah.

1306
02:14:29.12 --> 02:14:33.12
It works. Yeah, I probably compounded. Good. Continue your story until everyone whatnot today.

1307
02:14:33.12 --> 02:14:38.56
Yeah, yeah. So don't do this. No, but there's happening. So at the, so boom, I was over the sickness

1308
02:14:38.56 --> 02:14:44.24
my injury was good, and I worked and I worked up kind of hard, too. And it was weird because I went

1309
02:14:44.24 --> 02:14:48.80
in the workout thinking, okay, I'm glad I get to go workout, but when when you're done,

1310
02:14:49.68 --> 02:14:52.96
okay, I'll admit this. And I think a lot of people have these thoughts where

1311
02:14:52.96 --> 02:14:59.68
maybe you've done something, like maybe you're routine for whatever reason is going over and over,

1312
02:14:59.68 --> 02:15:05.92
like just real repetitive. And then after all, yeah, true, but I'm just saying, sometimes these thoughts,

1313
02:15:05.92 --> 02:15:11.52
like, what does all this even mean? Like, what, what, what, okay, I'm gonna get this and this and

1314
02:15:11.52 --> 02:15:17.60
it's like, you think too much. After a while, I can't. So at the end of life, it's like, okay, I did all

1315
02:15:17.60 --> 02:15:23.12
this. I just, I don't know, it just didn't really, I was having some of those thoughts. They weren't

1316
02:15:23.12 --> 02:15:29.20
like super heavier enough, but they're in there. They're like, okay, great. Anyway, so anyway,

1317
02:15:29.20 --> 02:15:37.04
fast forward, I worked out, did the workout, God after it, textbook definition of God after it,

1318
02:15:37.04 --> 02:15:42.72
that was workout. I was done in, and actually not even done, I was like in the middle of the workout.

1319
02:15:42.72 --> 02:15:49.84
And I was like, dang, life has straight up meaning. Like, this is what life is. Not necessarily

1320
02:15:49.84 --> 02:15:55.44
the workout, just saying everything I'm doing. You know, it was that feeling. Was that the Alpha

1321
02:15:55.44 --> 02:16:01.12
Brain? I must have been. So what you're saying is get out of the right. I'm saying, I'm saying,

1322
02:16:01.12 --> 02:16:05.92
go workout. Right, like that point. You got it. I'm not saying you got it, but I'm saying, if you

1323
02:16:05.92 --> 02:16:11.28
want to, yeah, workout, workout for sure. Change your life. Take on it. Big

1324
02:16:11.28 --> 02:16:17.04
tip. Yeah, so that Alpha Brain, um, that's a neutral pick. That helps your memory and whatnot.

1325
02:16:18.08 --> 02:16:23.92
So anyway, if you're going to workout and you want to take some supplements, which I recommend now,

1326
02:16:23.92 --> 02:16:29.84
I was never supplement person. I tried them, but never was really into them. Or I'd be like,

1327
02:16:29.84 --> 02:16:37.92
you, you got to take this. Take the pre workout, performance and strength. That's what

1328
02:16:37.92 --> 02:16:44.16
it's called. Check. Take that one. What about shrimp tech? I'd say take the shrimp tech.

1329
02:16:44.16 --> 02:16:48.32
Who's being a pretty good? I've been stacking up on telling you. See, watch out. I haven't been

1330
02:16:48.32 --> 02:16:54.32
taking shrimp tech. Oh, really? I feel like that's like cheating. Not cheating, cheating, but I mean,

1331
02:16:54.32 --> 02:16:59.68
in due to it. I mean, I don't feel like it's cheating. No, it's not cheating, but I feel like

1332
02:16:59.68 --> 02:17:04.08
said you thought it was cheating. I feel like, I'll tell you what, it doesn't matter. I mean,

1333
02:17:04.08 --> 02:17:12.000
when it comes down to it, shrimp tech or no shrimp tech, bring it. Okay. Yeah. All right. None the

1334
02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.80
less. My original point was, okay, working out, that's the enhancer. That's the enhancer. If you want

1335
02:17:16.80 --> 02:17:22.64
to enhance the enhancer today, that's all I think. You keep making me think of more stuff. Okay,

1336
02:17:22.64 --> 02:17:28.24
I'll stop talking. Yeah. And then I feel like, oh, I should talk about that anyway. Working out

1337
02:17:28.24 --> 02:17:35.52
is important part. That enhances the life. Yes. Alphabran, these supplements, Alphabran,

1338
02:17:35.52 --> 02:17:40.000
shrimp tech, all these other ones. That enhances the workout, which is the enhancer. So,

1339
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:45.76
enhance the enhancer kind of thing. Anyway, if you like these things, you want 10% off. You

1340
02:17:45.76 --> 02:17:51.28
don't want a pay full price or maybe do I don't know. But if you don't go on it.com slash

1341
02:17:51.28 --> 02:17:58.32
chocolate 10% off, support yourself as well and you're all it. I want to talk about Amazon, click through.

1342
02:17:59.60 --> 02:18:05.84
That's a good way to support. That's good because it's like, you know, small little thing doesn't

1343
02:18:05.84 --> 02:18:13.92
cost you anything as you always say. And, you know, big result, big support. Yeah, I'm going to make the

1344
02:18:13.92 --> 02:18:18.24
sodium and the fish tank analogy. I'm going to do it. Really? Yeah. Good because I wasn't expecting

1345
02:18:18.24 --> 02:18:22.48
that. Yeah, you throw the sodium in water and it blows up. Small species of sodium in the

1346
02:18:22.48 --> 02:18:25.84
bone blows up. That's important that you said that, but what would be more important would be

1347
02:18:25.84 --> 02:18:30.32
this actually say how you do Amazon click through. Yeah. So, yeah, I think you're right about that. So,

1348
02:18:30.32 --> 02:18:37.28
what you do is you go to joccrackcast.com, little banner on the side. There's the the UK1.co.uk

1349
02:18:37.28 --> 02:18:44.000
as well. Is there Germany? Yes, there's Germany. I think. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. It's right there on the

1350
02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:50.72
side. Boom. The main one, the top one or the one on top is the US one, Amazon.com. Click through there

1351
02:18:50.72 --> 02:18:55.36
before you do your Amazon shopping. That's the way to support. Doesn't cost you anything. Small

1352
02:18:55.36 --> 02:19:03.76
action, big reaction. Be the sodium. Be the sodium. Jocco is a store. It's called jocco store.

1353
02:19:05.36 --> 02:19:11.84
URL.jocco store.com. If you want shirts, disflin equals freedom, they're all jocco approved

1354
02:19:11.84 --> 02:19:17.04
an official. Go on there. Look at them. If you like them, get a shirt. Get a shirt.

1355
02:19:17.04 --> 02:19:21.04
By the way, they're not all jocco proof because I didn't approve the pink women's t-shirts. Yeah,

1356
02:19:21.04 --> 02:19:26.000
that's true. That was not approved. Right. That was actually jocco on approved. Yeah. But we

1357
02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:30.48
were mutiny and rebellion. Yeah, which is kind of part of the game too, right? No, not really.

1358
02:19:32.64 --> 02:19:39.20
Well, according to the shirts that we got, it is. Yeah, apparently. So, that one is technically not

1359
02:19:39.20 --> 02:19:44.32
jocco approved, but it's jocco on approved. So, it's dope nonetheless. And if you think they're

1360
02:19:44.32 --> 02:19:48.88
solid, then yeah, get a shirt, man. Support that way. It's a good way to support. Yeah, there's some

1361
02:19:48.88 --> 02:19:53.28
goodies on there in some rash guards. I've beginning to see more and more people with the rash

1362
02:19:53.28 --> 02:19:58.32
guards. Yeah, the rash guards seem to be popular. Yeah. Yeah, we stay victory in my main fitness.

1363
02:19:58.88 --> 02:20:04.80
Yeah. No, and online as well. See you guys doing it. Anyway, look at them. If you like something

1364
02:20:04.80 --> 02:20:10.000
gets something that's a good way to support. Coming out with a new travel mug. No, it improved.

1365
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:18.48
No one improved. High quality. High ear quality. High ear quality. Yes, like, technically.

1366
02:20:19.52 --> 02:20:22.96
Hold you. If you put something hot in there, hope makes it keeps it hot for a long time.

1367
02:20:22.96 --> 02:20:27.28
L hours. If it gave hours or something like that, it's cold, same thing. I think cold keeps it

1368
02:20:27.28 --> 02:20:36.96
long. It keeps it cold longer. Anyway, that'll be on the store in two weeks. Yeah. Also, good way to support.

1369
02:20:37.52 --> 02:20:42.56
And this is actually supporting yourself big time. It's like a little helper. It's like when you're

1370
02:20:42.56 --> 02:20:49.20
benching, you ever bench. I don't bench much anymore. Okay. So, in the event of you benching,

1371
02:20:49.20 --> 02:20:54.88
this is what it's like. It's benching is the analogy. It's like someone's spotting you. If you need it,

1372
02:20:54.88 --> 02:21:00.48
this is what it is. Psychological warfare. You like the it is, right? It's like a spot. You don't need it.

1373
02:21:00.48 --> 02:21:04.48
You don't need it necessarily every day. You don't need it all the time. Maybe you do. Maybe you don't

1374
02:21:04.48 --> 02:21:08.64
depends on, you know, a lot of things. But if you do need it, even if you just want it,

1375
02:21:08.64 --> 02:21:13.44
hey, can you spot me? I might get the, I'll probably get all eight. Yeah. But you're there. You know,

1376
02:21:13.44 --> 02:21:17.60
just in case. That's what this is. So, if you're like, hey, I'm gonna, okay, this is what it is

1377
02:21:17.60 --> 02:21:22.24
for those who don't know. Like, people do know. But if you don't know, it's an album you can buy from

1378
02:21:22.24 --> 02:21:28.56
iTunes with tracks on it for different scenarios of what weakness you'd call it. I'm a little bit

1379
02:21:28.56 --> 02:21:35.60
of weakness. And you need a little spot and guess who's spotting you? Talk. That's the guy to spot.

1380
02:21:35.60 --> 02:21:41.92
You're very dependable. Very reliable. punctual. All that stuff. They're like two minutes long.

1381
02:21:41.92 --> 02:21:47.52
Give or take, yeah. There's one about, you know, before you're gonna go and eat,

1382
02:21:47.52 --> 02:21:53.20
yeah. There's one called sugar coated lies. Yeah. I think that one might be a good one.

1383
02:21:55.04 --> 02:22:03.44
You got the end of that one, which is, I think, one of the more memorable moments, lines,

1384
02:22:03.44 --> 02:22:10.24
whatever. And you say something about mobilized your will, because your will is stronger than the

1385
02:22:10.24 --> 02:22:16.88
will of a donut. Right. Yeah. So, factual. Bro, and that's the one you need. Isn't it pretty sad, though?

1386
02:22:16.88 --> 02:22:20.48
You think you're self, okay. I'm not gonna eat this donut. Yeah. Because I'm just gonna hold my

1387
02:22:20.48 --> 02:22:25.36
willpower, but then it's somehow the the will, because a war is a war of wills, right? That's the war

1388
02:22:25.36 --> 02:22:29.44
is. So now if you lose that war against the donut, then your will is weaker than the donut.

1389
02:22:29.44 --> 02:22:33.36
I'd know not to, yeah. That's not gonna happen. No, not without that. No, that's a

1390
02:22:33.36 --> 02:22:36.88
more for a play. You put it into perspective. You're like, here's the donut and you're like,

1391
02:22:36.88 --> 02:22:40.16
you're will is stronger than the donut. And then you eat the donut. You basically said,

1392
02:22:40.16 --> 02:22:43.52
I understand that, send them this donut. Will is stronger than my,

1393
02:22:43.52 --> 02:22:47.76
don't want to be that person. That's your life right there. Yeah. Man. Putting to perspective.

1394
02:22:47.76 --> 02:22:53.20
Anyway, if you need that spot psychological warfare from Jaco Willing, do a search, I do.

1395
02:22:53.76 --> 02:23:00.24
And it's also on other things that aren't iTunes. Yeah. So Amazon, music, it's on, it's on.

1396
02:23:00.24 --> 02:23:04.80
It's no Google play. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. Anywhere that where you can get like MP3 music.

1397
02:23:04.80 --> 02:23:09.84
Yeah. Is it called that anymore? MP, is that still a thing? MP3 music? Well, MP3 is just the

1398
02:23:09.84 --> 02:23:17.36
file. Right. So, remember that you used to be MP3 players? Yeah. Yeah. Technically, everything.

1399
02:23:17.36 --> 02:23:24.32
That can play MP3s isn't MP3 player. Yeah. So, yeah, get, check that one out. That one's a good,

1400
02:23:24.32 --> 02:23:28.96
and it's a good way to support, you know. So that's it's all around circle of support in that way. Yeah.

1401
02:23:31.52 --> 02:23:38.16
Also, if you want to get some Jaco White Tea, you can get it. You can get that on Amazon.

1402
02:23:38.16 --> 02:23:42.40
And when you get it, I know some people are a little nervous when they try it for the first time.

1403
02:23:43.36 --> 02:23:49.76
Just be careful. You don't want to, you know, be in a situation where you, you're going to go a little bit

1404
02:23:49.76 --> 02:23:54.96
harder than normal, right? To be ready for that. When you bring out the Jaco White, you can get

1405
02:23:55.68 --> 02:24:00.000
once you've used it before. You don't have to worry about there's no precautionary. Well, once you're

1406
02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:04.72
once you're using it, yeah. But when you start, yeah, be careful. Because you're going to go

1407
02:24:04.72 --> 02:24:09.52
with that little extra stuff that you're going to go on a tack mode. Yeah. It's kind of like when you turn

1408
02:24:09.52 --> 02:24:15.20
on your car and the volume is up a little bit more than you're ready for. You're like, oh, but then

1409
02:24:15.20 --> 02:24:19.36
if you do it again, you're like, I'm, you know, same thing. Same thing. So watch out for that Jaco White

1410
02:24:19.36 --> 02:24:26.56
Tea on Amazon. Also, for international orders, it's on eBay. The official listing is of the Jaco

1411
02:24:26.56 --> 02:24:31.52
podcast sold by Pearl Resourceing. So if you're international and you want to get it, you can do that.

1412
02:24:31.52 --> 02:24:38.96
And for those of you that in America, there, it says you see that the shipping is $100. That's not

1413
02:24:38.96 --> 02:24:46.08
for you to get it from there. It's for you to get on Amazon if you're in America. If you're overseas,

1414
02:24:46.08 --> 02:24:51.04
the shipping won't show $100. We'll show whatever the cost is. So I've had a couple people like say,

1415
02:24:51.04 --> 02:24:55.52
why is the shipping $100? It's not. It's Amazon Prime. The shipping is no cost. Don't get it from

1416
02:24:55.52 --> 02:24:58.96
eBay. You understand what I say? So if you're in the US, if you're in the US and you made it, you're

1417
02:24:58.96 --> 02:25:02.64
going to be going to be trying to get it. The shipping will show $100. Don't get it from eBay. You're

1418
02:25:02.64 --> 02:25:06.64
not supposed to. We don't want to sell to everybody in America. We can't handle that. But we can sell

1419
02:25:06.64 --> 02:25:14.24
to some people overseas. Here's what you do. Jaco Tea.com. And that has this information on the

1420
02:25:14.24 --> 02:25:19.04
terms. So it doesn't have that particular information, but it's like just a basic website.

1421
02:25:20.16 --> 02:25:24.56
Dang, we didn't. I don't know why I didn't mention this before. So basic website, it's like,

1422
02:25:24.56 --> 02:25:29.04
oh, you're in the US order from here. Okay. And international order from here. Jaco Tea.

1423
02:25:29.04 --> 02:25:34.16
There is. Jaco Tea.com. It's on Jaco. It's on Jaco Store 2, but it's like you got to go to the

1424
02:25:34.16 --> 02:25:42.40
tab and then go to the page. You know, it's it's it's it's a thing. But go to Jaco Tea.com. If you if you're

1425
02:25:42.40 --> 02:25:46.80
just down for the tea, just need the tea there you go. Yeah. All right. Well, that's well, thank you

1426
02:25:46.80 --> 02:25:51.52
for informing us of that. Yet another website for those of you that are asking to get after it mugs,

1427
02:25:51.52 --> 02:26:02.40
we're looking at March to be honest with you. So keep looking. Also, you know, kids,

1428
02:26:03.20 --> 02:26:06.16
we got kids out there running around. We know that we know that kids are in

1429
02:26:06.16 --> 02:26:10.64
pressional. Yes, right. As they're growing up, we know that we also know that it's hard to be a

1430
02:26:10.64 --> 02:26:16.56
kid. Right. You come up against hard times. And if you want to help kids get through some hard times,

1431
02:26:16.56 --> 02:26:25.52
you can order this book that I just wrote pre-order it. It's called Way of the Warrior Kid.

1432
02:26:26.40 --> 02:26:31.92
And this is the weird thing about this book. So the other day I was talking to somebody,

1433
02:26:31.92 --> 02:26:37.68
it might have even been you. After I got done with edits like the final edits, I was talking

1434
02:26:37.68 --> 02:26:43.92
to someone. Yeah, you know, I just finished the final edits and I said, it's awesome. And then I

1435
02:26:43.92 --> 02:26:50.64
felt kind of weird because it's not exactly the most humble way to describe your work, right? Nope.

1436
02:26:50.64 --> 02:26:54.80
So I felt that. Like as soon as I said, I said, why am I saying that this book is awesome? That's

1437
02:26:54.80 --> 02:26:58.32
not like me. I didn't walk around and go extreme ownership. It's a best book ever. Yeah, I think

1438
02:26:58.32 --> 02:27:02.48
I'm all extreme ownership is awesome. I don't say, oh, listen to my podcast. It's awesome. No,

1439
02:27:02.48 --> 02:27:05.68
I don't say that. I said, hey, you know, if you want to listen to it, it might be interesting.

1440
02:27:05.68 --> 02:27:09.28
Oh, extreme ownership is good. You know, you might might get some value out of it. I'm not running

1441
02:27:09.28 --> 02:27:17.04
around saying, I'm awesome. Yeah. Some reason I said, oh, this book, I just got done reading it,

1442
02:27:17.04 --> 02:27:23.04
editing it. It's awesome. Right? So I kind of wondered why I said that and then I realized

1443
02:27:23.92 --> 02:27:30.56
that, wow, I'm reading. Okay. So when I wrote it, right, I wrote it like I was in a 10 year old kid.

1444
02:27:30.56 --> 02:27:34.72
Like, but that wasn't me. It was the guy that's in the book, Mark, because he's the character. Right.

1445
02:27:34.72 --> 02:27:38.88
So when I read it, it sounds like him. It doesn't sound like me. It sounds like him. Yeah. So

1446
02:27:38.88 --> 02:27:43.28
I read the book and I, I think it's him. That wrote it. This kid. Right. And I think to myself,

1447
02:27:43.28 --> 02:27:50.08
someone said, how's the book? And I go, man, it's awesome. So yeah, that's what I realized. And

1448
02:27:51.76 --> 02:27:58.16
but it is the kind of story that sounds, it's good to read. Mark the kid, the 10 year old kid.

1449
02:27:59.68 --> 02:28:05.76
He's hurt. Right. He's made fun of. Can't do any pull-ups. Doesn't know his time

1450
02:28:05.76 --> 02:28:11.60
to stay. It doesn't know how to swim. And he's getting bullied by Kenny Williamsson.

1451
02:28:12.80 --> 02:28:17.20
Okay. You know Kenny Williamsson. We all know this. I'm going to post a picture. Can you? I haven't

1452
02:28:17.20 --> 02:28:22.96
introduced Kenny Williamsson yet to the public, but I don't know get a picture out to him. So he's

1453
02:28:22.96 --> 02:28:27.92
going through all this trials and tribulations about luckily his uncle Jake happens to be a big

1454
02:28:27.92 --> 02:28:32.48
tough frog man. He's going to come and stay with him for the summer. And when, oh, guess what?

1455
02:28:32.48 --> 02:28:38.40
But when, when Mark breaks down, because he doesn't tell his mom what's going on, because his

1456
02:28:38.40 --> 02:28:43.20
mom just is kind of, you know, she doesn't, she doesn't quite, you know, you know what she's

1457
02:28:43.20 --> 02:28:49.68
going to say? Oh, right. You'll learn that stuff. She could say, oh, honey, you're a nice boy. Don't

1458
02:28:49.68 --> 02:28:54.64
worry about that big bully. He won't bother you anymore. No, no, my mom actually he will. Right.

1459
02:28:55.76 --> 02:29:01.92
So, so Mark breaks down kind of, he won't tell his mom, but then uncle comes and his uncle's like,

1460
02:29:01.92 --> 02:29:06.64
hey, we, you know, we're gonna hang out. What are you gonna do? Do anything I get swim breaks down.

1461
02:29:07.60 --> 02:29:12.96
So, you know what uncle Jake says when Mark gets done listing all of his problems?

1462
02:29:12.96 --> 02:29:21.20
They don't. He says, good. All those problems you got? We can take care of those problems. Those

1463
02:29:21.20 --> 02:29:26.40
are all solvable. All we got to do is we got to work, we got to study, we got to train. And that's

1464
02:29:26.40 --> 02:29:35.60
what they do. So, like I said, I won't say it's awesome. But from the perspective of the kid,

1465
02:29:35.60 --> 02:29:40.72
when you look at it, if a kid wrote that, you'd say that's a pretty good story. You got there. And

1466
02:29:40.72 --> 02:29:47.92
here's a deal. A pre-order on Amazon. Why? Why pre-order? Let me tell you why. They got to

1467
02:29:47.92 --> 02:29:51.68
print it, right? And they're gonna print, they're gonna go, oh, you know, it's a kids'

1468
02:29:51.68 --> 02:29:57.12
ball. And kids' books don't sound very well. So, you know, you just, we'll print out 80 copies.

1469
02:29:57.12 --> 02:30:01.92
What are you know, we got their formula. They got their formula. Right? The formula's not going to work.

1470
02:30:02.64 --> 02:30:08.64
Just like it didn't work for Jogway. The formula is not going to work. So, the earlier that you pre-order,

1471
02:30:09.20 --> 02:30:14.000
the more they'll print, the then that we won't have the shortage, the scenario, the massive

1472
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.48
screaming in the street saying, give us a book. So pre-order and that'll take care of that while you're

1473
02:30:18.48 --> 02:30:26.56
doing it, pick up, rape and anti-naking. Iris Chang. These will be on the Joggo podcast store,

1476
02:30:37.68 --> 02:30:44.16

1477
02:30:44.16 --> 02:30:49.52
you know what? Get a few copies and I'll tell you why. Because you got to give them to your

1478
02:30:49.52 --> 02:30:54.56
people on the team. Right? How many people write to me to I gave this to someone so and they said,

1479
02:30:54.56 --> 02:30:59.04
thank you. Yeah, this is great. Get them home the game. You know they need it. If you didn't have it,

1480
02:30:59.04 --> 02:31:02.40
would you want somebody to give it to you? Let me ask you that question. Yes, you would. It's going

1481
02:31:02.40 --> 02:31:06.56
to help you out with your game. So you're going to want to do that. And by the way, if you're

1482
02:31:06.56 --> 02:31:11.60
caught, if you're at your company, your business and you need some some leadership alignment,

1483
02:31:11.60 --> 02:31:16.80
you're got some little situations going on, you can check out Lave Babin. I also we don't

1484
02:31:16.80 --> 02:31:19.84
a book. We also have a company called Eshelon Front. You can check that out. That's what we do,

1485
02:31:19.84 --> 02:31:26.48
leadership and management consulting. And that's what we do. We get companies, leadership aligned

1486
02:31:26.48 --> 02:31:33.68
and on the same page and give them the tools to lead and win. Enough said on that. Also with

1487
02:31:33.68 --> 02:31:38.96
Extreme Ownership, we got the mustard coming, mustard number two, May 4th and 5th,

1488
02:31:38.96 --> 02:31:47.20
Mary at Marquis New York City. Boom. Yeah. Now, you know, people talk about people say,

1489
02:31:47.20 --> 02:31:53.12
oh, it's a game changer. Right. People say that. Sure. I think and then you usually go,

1490
02:31:53.12 --> 02:31:59.44
really, they had changed. They got a new flavor of tortilla chips at the restaurant. It's a game

1491
02:31:59.44 --> 02:32:04.88
changer. No, that's not a game changer. But description, kind of the most common description I've

1492
02:32:04.88 --> 02:32:12.96
heard of mustard number one that we didn't send Diego is game changer. So people are getting after

1493
02:32:12.96 --> 02:32:20.24
it leadership, management, health, due to the good stuff. Of course, I'm going to be there. Of course,

1494
02:32:20.24 --> 02:32:25.36
Lave Babin, he's going to be there. Obviously echo Charles, going to be there. JP to now you heard

1495
02:32:25.36 --> 02:32:31.28
him on the podcast. You're going to see him there. And we none of us, none of us are meeting backstage.

1496
02:32:31.28 --> 02:32:37.76
There will not be a backstage. We're not going to be there. We'll be with you out front talking,

1497
02:32:37.76 --> 02:32:45.84
discussing solving problems and crushing things. So come and get that May 4th and 5th. And until

02:32:45.84 --> 02:32:55.20
the mustard, while you're waiting to get to the mustard, you can still kick it with us. Absolutely,

1499
02:32:55.20 --> 02:33:01.84
because we're on the interwebs. We are on Instagram. We are on Twitter as well. And if you're going

1502
02:33:23.12 --> 02:33:31.92
you do in the military and the police and the fire department, thanks to you all for keeping us safe.

1503
02:33:33.28 --> 02:33:42.96
And then the workforce, the troopers around the world, creating and building what we have,

1504
02:33:44.24 --> 02:33:50.88
making the world a better place. Thank you for what you do grinding and pushing,

1505
02:33:50.88 --> 02:34:06.80
and making things happen. And again, I know that this podcast was hard to listen to.

1506
02:34:06.80 --> 02:34:23.60
I know that this episode was disturbing. And it was hard for me to read. But again, to me,

1507
02:34:24.64 --> 02:34:35.28
it is a reminder. It's a reminder to all of us that darkness is real. And as I said, we cannot get

1508
02:34:35.28 --> 02:34:41.92
lost in that darkness. And we can't let the people we know get lost in that darkness. And it's a

1509
02:34:41.92 --> 02:34:56.000
reminder that we have to illuminate that darkness. And we cannot, we cannot let evil thrive and

1510
02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:10.96
permeate, permeate. We can't let it permeate on a mass scale like an N. King or on a personal level.

1511
02:35:10.96 --> 02:35:29.68
Like the beautiful Iris Chang. So get out there. Get out there. Live your life.

1512
02:35:29.68 --> 02:35:38.72
Get after it. Get after it every day. Go out there into the world.

1513
02:35:42.72 --> 02:35:43.36
And shine.

1514
02:35:43.36 --> 02:35:56.40
So until next time, this is echo and jocco out.
