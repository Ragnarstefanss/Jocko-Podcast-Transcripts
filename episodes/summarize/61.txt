So, so, I come in Thursday night, I'm pulling up in my 1991 ever, like Dodge Caravan pull up and many van man and there's that car, there's more cars, nothing, so now I walk in and it's, there's people everywhere, right, it's crowded, it's crowded, it went from like 10 or 12 people in the class, now we, there's like a hundred people there, I'm serious, we had to lay out like all these different mats and everyone is quiet, no one's talking, it was, I was too old, so Hicksson's there, and he's, you know, like, in a corner, you know, just cool chill and he looks at Lamaun and he, you know, gives him like a head nod in the months, okay, we're warming up and I was like, okay, so everyone gets in the line, they start doing the old school, due to we're running in a circle, silence, like no one's saying anything, it's just silence, and so you could feel the presence of Hicks and there's a hundred people now and there's just ten times as many people and everyone's quiet, everyone's serious and then, you know, we get done with like a 20 minute warm-up of stretchy and exercise, this is just getting after it my self it's like we're like a little group of like this is a good it's a good thing you know get everybody out of bed and stop eating donuts and you get a good thing there it is if you want some jocca white tea it's in stock it's on Amazon if you're in America get it on Amazon if you're in a foreign country go to eBay pro-resourcing it's the official listing you can get it there you you already know what what the tea is gonna do for you you already know that you are weak you'll become strong you are stupid you're gonna become smart you are lazy you're gonna become aggressive just gonna solve all your problems you know what that's the side effects because it also just tastes good so which one's you gonna go and I'll tell you what right now I don't we are assessing and likely going to put jocquite in cans like an energy drink and you know the the cool thing about Hixon is he's got a personality that I would love to tell you that he's you know like a stereotypical peaceful warrior master that scenes content with where he's ended up in life and with his experiences in life but with Hixon I get the feeling that he's a guy that fighting is in his blood right and even though he's a mellow guy and he has nothing to prove to anybody I think and it kind of feels like the way I feel he likes the taste of blood you know what I mean and even though I'm kind of the same way like I feel like you know and uncle Marx says or uncle Jake says by doing everything I just said a normal kid doesn't push himself a warrior kid does a normal kid doesn't work to constantly improve himself a warrior kid does I look at all these problems you cried to me about yesterday a warrior kid wouldn't cry about those problems a warrior kid would do something about those problems and then Marx says do what do what do whatever it takes every problem you have can be overcome every one of them you can't do pull-ups you work out and get stronger until you can you don't know your times tables you study and train your mind until you know them cold you can't swim you learn how you get picked on you learn out of fight fight I asked yes fight just like anything else in the world there are techniques to fighting like learning a sport and when you know the techniques and practice them you can defend yourself from anyone you really think I could learn all that I know you can like I told you last night I had to transform myself when I got in the navy I had to get stronger I had to learn to fight I even had to learn to learn Dean it's really good because when you know I train with Dean all the time and so you know there's no one that that I roll with on a regular basis I don't roll with some really good guys but when Dean is mounted on you or when Dean is on side control on you it is insufferable it's a bad position and especially because like I'll roll with I roll with other really high level guys that aren't from our school and when I roll with them if they get a position like that they don't know exactly my every little escape Dean knows exactly knows you know all 14 of my escapes he knows them all so you're more trapped and it's the same with him when I get to position I know what he's gonna do so I assume that you're doing a good job and we're gonna continue what you're doing that's what he said when he took over so what's going on here is you got two completely different situations and the two situations are one is a guy taking over first situation a known bad situation the troops are lacking discipline they're not executing the mission and if you remember for that story they weren't even doing basic military bearing they didn't they weren't saluting the officers they just had thrown everything out the window that's the situation we got to come and you got to get firm out of the gate that's what you got to do now they got to know that they got to know that things are gonna change they got to know it's real they got to know there's a new plan so both those guys should you should instead of saying hey you know what they should do walk up and be like hey man you know what I noticed you're pretty successful financially I would like to get in the game with you a little bit and learn from you about that and the other guys should take them well you know what it looks like you're in pretty good fitness levels I would like to get in the game with that let's work together and improve ourselves and go out and kick ass and dominate are you in I mean let's do this instead what is a normal person do they do exactly what you said justify criticize cut people down instead of building them up so here we go so at this point here's what's going on at this point basically the kid mark he's like I said he doesn't know how to do he can't to any pull-ups doesn't know his time stables he's getting picked on its rule doesn't know how to swim guess what he's a ten-year-old kid in life life is hard he's realized that he's bummed out he's been sad his uncle Jake comes to live with him for the summer his uncle Jake used to be in the seal teams he's getting out so he can go to college but during the summer he's living with his sister so now when uncle Jake realizes that mark as all these issues like I said what does he say when mark freaks out and cries it says like all these issues uncle Jake says good we can solve these problems and then he says look you you know better shape and I can you can go longer less class for him just in general but the the bigger impact was that that's not something I have to worry about anymore dealing with being and when I get tired mentally you become you know what it feels like to be tired because I don't get you know what that felt like before it was hard to deal with I would say that's how it felt to me like what I'm like I'm tired I need to not be tired that's the goal now I don't care about getting tapped out yeah things just one big mystery no one big path to victory you know you know take the krill oil on it ecologically friendly harvesting of krill watch the video on it dot com on it dot com slash jockel if you want 10% off pre-workout which is total strength and performance he'll give you more strength and more performance my anecdotal shrimp tech proof by the way I I got on I had a bunch of like I said I've been working a lot I've been traveling a lot we're traveling you're getting on planes with a bunch of people that you don't know and they have all kinds of germs as do I and two people get sick and I can't be sick and do my job because I got to go talk to people and meet people and give speeches and all that stuff so when I bring them from the the water filler thing to my car I'm grabbing them both and I'm walking across the street you're too ready at four I had four but two at a time I feel too because it's two right things whatever so therefore I'm walking across street to you know not the street the parking lot to my car to put them in and I'm like this isn't even hard but they look kind of big you know I'm like this isn't even hard just like I'm not like stiff but he's not in that good shape we're out of no he smokes and whatever you know that it's easy I think a lot of people it feels like it's easy to justify wolf that guy's in bad shape so who cares I wouldn't want any of that I wouldn't want all the money you know all this stuff it seems like you just gotta justify that and you know what the other guy's saying obviously so when you get two guys well let me let me refray that when you get two guys that are evenly matched and are going at it hard they're both gonna be tired and so they're gonna want a little bit of rest so if you give them that opportunity to back off the throttle just a little bit subconsciously they're gonna do it because they think they're doing good they think that won that last round so you can see that all the time you see I mean it happened it happened with Ronda you know they're saying hey good job good job you're looking good I'm I'm with you you want to give that maybe you let out that little sigh of frustration you know like a little like something like that right just gonna do that little thing just do that let's just show in that you do got some emotions and you are invested in all that stuff you know it's like I'm not the honest truth is I'm excited about other things we'll just say that that's gross I'm all those I love all that love you got for crying about the fact that you're getting better you're getting better you're gonna know I look it's all going backwards now people are gonna hate you now don't grab talk about it exactly you're daughter draws your beautiful picture you know care about it but if it is and you got the cruel oil going that's the kind of things you can do almost like a superpower anyway if you want these amazing supplements and know they're the best ones because we all know that on it dot com slash jockel 10% off support yourself support everyone anyway and if you shop at amazon it's a good way to support and you know you shop at amazon yeah it's like you talking to yourself like your brain it's like the place in your head it's true and this is a good one just like the real oil and just like the the on it yeah kind of like you ever seen the guys who go they see like a football player or something like I kick his ass though you know that can you can always like some success for us but I'm gonna tell you uncle Jake who's in the book who teaches his nephew how to get after it uncle Jake's got some lessons for everybody about discipline about working out about overcoming fear about diet and exercise and life it's a book about life and wait I was right how did you get that I know you're all a third of those got a physical copy of physical copy that I'm holding in my hands right now it's called a galley give you it's so that you can see and make sure you can go through it and correct it like a final edit like a final edit and this one's pretty good it's pretty close it's a tasty I'm not saying buy shirt just go to the jockelstore dot com go there look at the shirt you like the shirt you want to represent you want to support get a shirt get a rashguard got some good reviews on the rashguard multiple instances of increasing performance and results with the rashguard proven and against jockels philosophy and they look good you know if you care you know that you want to look good and if you come out weak he's going to get the upper hand right away you need to put him away you need to go out there and crush him crush his soul turn it on and put this guy away I want you to kill him so that's what you need to do with that now for tactical training same thing because you know I know this police officers and swap teams and you guys that are in the military you're doing tactical training all the time and you're going to see the as the team comes together they're going to start to do good We'd lay out the mats on the wooden floor and the dance studio and then we'd, we'd train and shoot the breeze, kind of like a Jiu-Jitsu class, just laid back, a little stretch, maybe learn to move or two, had some rolls, a little bit more relaxed, Fabio, Fabio Santos runs of the Esmore Old School and more regimented, you know, Fabio, you're like, gonna get in there, you're gonna do your warm-up and then you're gonna learn some moves I know it's going to be a tough I know we just lost a sale or I know we just you know I'm going to have to plan another mission that we just got back I understand that it's hard so my mind kept while we were talking my mind kept going into like jumping outside of my brain and thinking like look what you're doing right now you're sitting with Hixon you know how like after we roll and we don't have anywhere to be we'll be just talking about stuff just sitting there most people that's how well then you don't need to step in there and show that you're the man by making these sweeping changes you don't need to do that it comes across it comes across like the people that you just took charge of have no idea what they're doing and you don't you don't respect what they did what they what their methodology you don't respect their their performance because you're coming in saying oh echo by the way the way you report court the podcast you need to get rid of those microphones you need to edit it tighter your basis to you know what would you be thinking if I came in and said that well you know mean a little bit different it's actually good like that that's a one where you know how you got you got to condense it down obviously you know like you have to distill it down and he's kind of looking at me like as if to say like so what up you know who are you what are we doing you know like but then they're not going to challenge their brain power or like the question that was you know the example here that was posed you know someone that's a fitness guru or a party guru I'm throwing that one out there because some people really good at or they you know they're on entrepreneur coming on entrepreneur and that's the vip prod say I mean if you have like a condit dined it that to me back in the when I had he was like mounted then I'd be like and on a tap he's like no man that's like man but it's not like it's like a cortisone shot where you know you just don't feel like when you get off at your jack you know you're back to zero but you can you can just get a better grasp it's just like jujitsu can if you understand the concept yeah that you have to be able to move your hips there's a bunch of different ways you can get your hips moving right if you understand the concept that you need to immobilize the hips to pass the guard if you understand that concept there's all kinds of different ways you can do if you understand the concept of totally jacked up team is gonna need a sweeping change to get their attention and get them to understand that things are gonna change and what they were doing is unacceptable if you understand that concept that that's what it's gonna take you can apply it all the way through those gradations all the way down to hey this team is doing great that's kind of like after you like box a guy you say hey you can take punches really basically basically your face is tough and that's another thing I mean I kind of held onto that like I always like to come from one bad position he's coming on the podcast through this well and as just like the first monster there's not going to be a backstage there's no green room that we're going to be hiding in we will be out front we will be talking to you discussing things taking ownership of the problems that we all have and get himself so we will see you there at the master extreme ownership.com and until we do see you there we will see you on the interwebs on twitter on instagram and maybe we're going to see one that facebook you will be interacting with all of you echo is at echo Charles and I am at jockel willink into the military men and women that are out there right now in arms away putting your life at risk for our great nation thank you all for our freedom and to those that have fallen for the cause of freedom we will never forget for the police fighting crime and the firefighters fighting fires and the rest of the first responders out there thanks to you all for keeping us safe and to everyone else out there thank you for listening and thank you for supporting this podcast and thanks for being here with us you people that we hear from all the time from all over the world in every walk of life thank you for joining us as we make our way through the world trying to extract every drop of blood from this life by pushing forward every day with everything that we've got all of us and getting after it so until next time this is echo and jockel out and we can't take our foot off the enemy's throat we are going to be relentless we are not going to give him the chance to regroup he will not get the chance to recover there will be no downtime for the enemy and I'll tell you what I don't even want the enemy to have a chance to bury their dead we are not going to stop until there is nothing left to pursue and no one left to bury so sharpen up your knives load up your magazines because we got work to do so again we got a counter you know the compliments and balance essentially what I'm doing in each one of those you know situations I'm balancing the positive affirmations of what is happening with some new goals and new objectives that will ensure that there will be no slack so the guy said that there were ninth graders but there is a capacity that you reach where you go okay now one of these things that is just started to slide now I need to make sure that my levels get re-re-re-leveled I guess you might say equalized is what I should have said so back to the subject don't be a one trick pony you know be a jack of all trades and then master a few of those trades so you can emphasize vignis guru you can emphasize intellectual power you can emphasize jiu-jitsu but don't put a hundred percent of your effort into one area because eventually it will take you you won't have anything else and by the way if you put all your you know if you put all your all your eggs in the basket of intellectual power now you're unhealthy and you die right that doesn't you know let me care how smart you are you can't do two plus two when you're dead so don't put all your focus a hundred percent into one area don't become unbalanced in your disciplines spread it around an old line So, I'm going to these classes two, three times a day and there's 10, 15 people, you know, and they're good, you know, we're all probably about the same, you know, he might have been a purple belt or two and Lamaun was awesome, super cool guy, real casual guy.
