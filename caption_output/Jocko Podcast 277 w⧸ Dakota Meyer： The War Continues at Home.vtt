00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.22
This is Jockel Podcast number 277 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, I

2
00:00:06.22 --> 00:00:14.18
go. Good evening. It is again impressed upon every officer and man of this command that

3
00:00:14.18 --> 00:00:22.42
ground once captured must under no circumstances be given up in the absence of direct, positive

4
00:00:22.42 --> 00:00:30.32
and formal orders to do so, emanating from these headquarters. Troops occupying ground

5
00:00:30.32 --> 00:00:39.18
must be supported against counter attack and all gains held. It is if favorite trick of the

6
00:00:39.18 --> 00:00:47.82
Germans to spread confusion by calling out retire or fall back. If inaction any such

7
00:00:47.82 --> 00:00:56.22
command is heard, officers and men may be sure that it is given by the enemy. Whoever

8
00:00:56.22 --> 00:01:03.42
gives such a command is a traitor and it is the duty of any officer or man who is loyal

9
00:01:03.42 --> 00:01:13.14
to his country and who hears such an order given to shoot the offender upon the spot.

10
00:01:13.14 --> 00:01:23.76
They are not going back but forward. So came the order from Major General Robert

11
00:01:23.76 --> 00:01:33.98
Alexander on the morning of September 26, 1918 at the beginning of the Muse Argonne

12
00:01:33.98 --> 00:01:44.90
Offensive World War I. A few days later, October 1, Major Charles White Wittlesy was given

13
00:01:44.90 --> 00:01:53.50
his orders. He was to advance north up the Argonne ravine, go across a brook and take

14
00:01:53.50 --> 00:01:58.98
Charlottesville mill and the purpose was to get control of this mill from which a nearby

15
00:01:58.98 --> 00:02:05.46
road and nearby rail line could be controlled. I want to say that completed. They were to push

16
00:02:05.46 --> 00:02:15.74
on to heal 198 to be to complete a flanking maneuver on the enemy. This is salt. Started

17
00:02:15.74 --> 00:02:26.34
on October 2. The man woke up eight breakfast and commenced to fighting by the evening

18
00:02:26.34 --> 00:02:35.38
of October 2. Major Wittlesley got reports that his men had found a way up hill 1,198.

19
00:02:35.38 --> 00:02:45.34
So they attacked. Got control of the hill. Got control of the hill with men from battalions

20
00:02:45.34 --> 00:02:53.26
of the 307th and 308th infantry regiments of the 154th infantry brigade 77th division.

21
00:02:53.26 --> 00:02:59.38
Now once he got control of this hill, didn't receive any communication from the French unit

22
00:02:59.38 --> 00:03:03.46
that was supposed to be protecting his left flank and no communication from an American

23
00:03:03.46 --> 00:03:11.06
unit that was supposed to be protecting his right flank. And it's World War I. There's

24
00:03:11.06 --> 00:03:15.42
no radios or anything where the flanks had collapsed. He didn't know this, but the Germans

25
00:03:15.42 --> 00:03:26.06
had taken the ground. Wittlesley and his men dug in. Created a defensive position on that

26
00:03:26.06 --> 00:03:35.42
hill which became known as the pocket. At about 2230 that night, Wittlesley realized

27
00:03:35.42 --> 00:03:43.62
the Germans were on hill 205 and they were in the ravine off to his right. The morning

28
00:03:43.62 --> 00:03:50.42
of October 3, Wittlesley sent out runners to his flanks to establish communications

29
00:03:50.42 --> 00:03:55.02
find out where these American and French units were. That's what you did in World War.

30
00:03:55.02 --> 00:03:58.90
One, when you know what was happening, you didn't have radios to call, so you sent runners

31
00:03:58.90 --> 00:04:08.50
or you sent carrier pigeons. So he sends out the runners to the left and right flank,

32
00:04:08.50 --> 00:04:16.26
known of them come back. Since carrier pigeons with various messages about their position

33
00:04:16.26 --> 00:04:26.62
and situations, receives no communication back. And he comes to the realization that they

34
00:04:26.62 --> 00:04:39.30
must be completely surrounded. On the afternoon of October 3, the Germans attacked from all

35
00:04:39.30 --> 00:04:47.58
sides. One of the American company commanders, a guy named Captain Holderman, let a break

36
00:04:47.58 --> 00:04:55.98
out to try and connect with allied forces took massive casualties and the breakout was

37
00:04:55.98 --> 00:05:05.14
stopped so they're surrounded and stuck. And the Germans attacked with mortars to get the

38
00:05:05.14 --> 00:05:16.90
heads down and then got closer and attacked with grenades. Then the Americans held.

39
00:05:16.90 --> 00:05:23.02
And as evening approached, the Germans backed off because while the Germans were assaulting,

40
00:05:23.02 --> 00:05:32.58
not only did they cause massive casualties, they received massive casualties. On the

41
00:05:32.58 --> 00:05:39.34
morning of four October, the major, major whittles, he was worried that no one knew what

42
00:05:39.34 --> 00:05:49.26
his situation was. There was massive casualties. And then they began getting sheld. But

43
00:05:49.26 --> 00:05:59.62
they began getting sheld by their own artillery. And he has one last carrier pigeon left.

44
00:05:59.62 --> 00:06:04.86
And he launches it. And this last carrier pigeon arrives at headquarters. It's been shot

45
00:06:04.86 --> 00:06:13.02
through the breast. It's been blinded one eye. And it's got one leg hanging on by a tendon.

46
00:06:13.02 --> 00:06:21.10
And the message says, we are along the road parallel to 276.4. Our own artillery is dropping

47
00:06:21.10 --> 00:06:37.22
a barrage directly on us for heaven's sake. Stop it. So the artillery stops. And then

48
00:06:37.22 --> 00:06:44.90
the Germans attack again. And they're driven back once again. And there's again mass casualties

49
00:06:44.90 --> 00:06:52.82
on both sides, except for that the Americans are running low on ammunition. They don't

50
00:06:52.82 --> 00:07:03.94
have any food. The one water source that they had close by exposed them to German fire. And

51
00:07:03.94 --> 00:07:14.98
so this continues on the fifth and the sixth of October. Attack after attack, the wounded in

52
00:07:14.98 --> 00:07:20.74
the dead pile up. And on the seventh of October the Germans send a blind folded American

53
00:07:20.74 --> 00:07:32.90
POW forward carrying a white flag. And he has a note with him. And the note is directed

54
00:07:32.90 --> 00:07:39.38
to the commanding officer of the Americans. And it says, the suffering of your wounded men

55
00:07:40.58 --> 00:07:47.62
can be heard over here in the German lines. And we are appealing to your humane sentiments to stop.

56
00:07:50.50 --> 00:07:55.54
The white flag shown by one of your men will tell us that you agree with these conditions.

57
00:07:55.54 --> 00:08:06.10
Please treat private lowl are hauling sheds, the bearer of this note as an honorable man.

58
00:08:07.30 --> 00:08:11.06
He's quite a soldier. We envy you.

59
00:08:13.94 --> 00:08:16.58
Signed the German commanding officer.

60
00:08:16.58 --> 00:08:25.14
And major, whittles the allegedly replied, you go to hell.

61
00:08:30.66 --> 00:08:38.98
So they honkered down and they braised for more attacks. And then that night a relief

62
00:08:38.98 --> 00:08:48.82
force arrived and the Germans finally retreated. And of the 554 troops that originally attacked,

63
00:08:49.62 --> 00:09:03.78
that hill, 190 wounded, 63 were missing and 17 were killed. Only 194 were able to walk out.

64
00:09:03.78 --> 00:09:20.98
They became known as the lost battalion. There were seven medals of honor awarded for this action,

65
00:09:20.98 --> 00:09:31.30
including one two major Charles W. Whittlesley, who was immediately promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.

66
00:09:35.62 --> 00:09:40.50
And if you are tracking the dates here, this was an October of 1918, and the war ended

67
00:09:40.50 --> 00:09:47.46
a little over a month later November 11th, 1918, and this became in America, one of the most

68
00:09:47.46 --> 00:09:58.74
publicized events of the war. So the war ends in November of 1918. In 1919,

69
00:10:00.34 --> 00:10:07.06
there's a movie came out. The movie was called the Lost Battalion. Whittlesley himself

70
00:10:08.18 --> 00:10:10.82
was in the film, playing himself.

71
00:10:10.82 --> 00:10:21.46
And it's a silent film. You can go watch it. You can see him. You can see him reenacting

72
00:10:21.46 --> 00:10:29.14
these events. And he tried to go back to civilian life. He's now out of the army

73
00:10:30.18 --> 00:10:37.62
and he's smart and he's educated. He's has a law degree from Harvard and he added his own law

74
00:10:37.62 --> 00:10:51.70
partnership before the war. But obviously things had changed. And one thing that had changed was

75
00:10:54.66 --> 00:11:00.50
a movie star and a hero and there was this constant demand for speeches and there were

76
00:11:00.50 --> 00:11:09.62
parades for him and interviews and the star to wear on him and in November of 1921,

77
00:11:11.38 --> 00:11:19.14
he served as a Paul Bear at the burial of the unknown soldier at Arlington National Semitary.

78
00:11:19.14 --> 00:11:37.78
And a few days later, he booked a trip on a ship from New York to Havana, a ship called the SS

79
00:11:37.78 --> 00:11:51.06
to Lowa. And he set sail on November 26, 1921. And that night he had dinner.

80
00:11:52.90 --> 00:11:59.78
He chatted with some people about 1130 that night. He left for his state room.

81
00:11:59.78 --> 00:12:11.38
And in the morning, the stewards knocked on his door to going to his cabin and no one answered

82
00:12:11.38 --> 00:12:23.22
to the entered his cabin so they could clean. And they found a note. And the note said

83
00:12:23.22 --> 00:12:36.42
to the captain of the SS to Lowa. Deer Sir, my name is Charles W. Wittlesy,

84
00:12:37.54 --> 00:12:42.82

87
00:12:59.06 --> 00:13:03.30

I am very sorry to bother you with these unpleasant details.

103
00:14:46.98 --> 00:15:04.98
Cyan Charles W. Wittlesley.

104
00:15:07.54 --> 00:15:16.34
His body was never recovered and they put a stone for him in the military cemetery in

105
00:15:16.34 --> 00:15:20.66
Pitsfield Massachusetts that reads in memory of Charles W.

106
00:15:20.66 --> 00:15:26.18
Wittlesley Lieutenant Colonel US Army World War I 1884 to 1921.

107
00:15:26.18 --> 00:15:46.42
Metal of Honor.

108
00:15:46.42 --> 00:15:51.62
And that's that.

109
00:15:51.62 --> 00:16:02.90
Hero and the tragedy and you can't help but ask yourself how does this happen.

110
00:16:02.90 --> 00:16:09.22
How does the story of heroism and camaraderie encourage how does that turn into a story of

111
00:16:09.22 --> 00:16:17.10
despair and loneliness and loss of hope?

112
00:16:17.10 --> 00:16:19.14
And what can we learn from that story?

113
00:16:19.14 --> 00:16:33.54
How can we learn to avoid that tragedy and move away from the darkest and move toward the light?

114
00:16:33.54 --> 00:16:41.46
And here tonight to discuss that with us.

115
00:16:41.46 --> 00:16:47.86
There's one of the few people in the world that can have some semblance of understanding

116
00:16:47.86 --> 00:16:55.14
of that story of what Colonel Wittlesley went through.

117
00:16:55.14 --> 00:16:58.66
His name is Dakota Meyer and if you don't know who he is then just stop listening right

118
00:16:58.66 --> 00:17:04.26
now and go listen to podcast number 115.

119
00:17:04.26 --> 00:17:05.86
Dakota Meyer is a Marine.

120
00:17:05.86 --> 00:17:06.98
He's a sniper.

121
00:17:06.98 --> 00:17:08.98
He's a father.

122
00:17:08.98 --> 00:17:13.42
He's a recipient of the Metal of Honor.

123
00:17:13.42 --> 00:17:16.06
He's one of my heroes.

124
00:17:16.06 --> 00:17:21.10
My most important is one of my friends.

125
00:17:21.10 --> 00:17:23.10
Dakota.

126
00:17:23.10 --> 00:17:26.06
Thanks for coming down man.

127
00:17:26.06 --> 00:17:28.94
Thanks for having me.

128
00:17:28.94 --> 00:17:31.66
Man.

129
00:17:31.66 --> 00:17:38.90
That's, you know, that hits home.

130
00:17:38.90 --> 00:17:42.10
You know I was listening to the last time you were on this podcast.

131
00:17:42.10 --> 00:17:48.62
And we basically kind of closed it out after you received the Metal of Honor.

132
00:17:48.62 --> 00:17:50.74
I mean we went just a little bit past it.

133
00:17:50.74 --> 00:17:59.38
But you know since then, you and I have talked about things that are going on and what

134
00:17:59.38 --> 00:18:01.86
it was like after that.

135
00:18:01.86 --> 00:18:11.22
And you know as I read through that story of Colonel Wittlesley, you can see there's

136
00:18:11.22 --> 00:18:12.22
definite parallels.

137
00:18:12.22 --> 00:18:18.22
Oh, I mean it's, yeah I mean like why you were reading it.

138
00:18:18.22 --> 00:18:26.62
I mean like I was like tearing up because like I could just, I could feel how lonely

139
00:18:26.62 --> 00:18:29.10
that guy was.

140
00:18:29.10 --> 00:18:33.10
You know it's, yeah.

141
00:18:33.10 --> 00:18:40.98
I mean you know, how do you, yeah I mean there's, like what do you do the rest of

142
00:18:40.98 --> 00:18:41.98
your life?

143
00:18:41.98 --> 00:18:45.22
You know like what do you, what do you do the rest of your life?

144
00:18:45.22 --> 00:18:47.46
You know like yeah you can keep going and giving back.

145
00:18:47.46 --> 00:18:55.18
But it's also a lonely road because you know everybody's sitting here just, first off

146
00:18:55.18 --> 00:18:57.94
you don't know why they're around you.

147
00:18:57.94 --> 00:19:04.34
You know and then you don't know and everybody loves to just like they just want to

148
00:19:04.34 --> 00:19:06.34
watch you fail.

149
00:19:06.34 --> 00:19:09.66
You know what I mean so that they can in their mind make themselves feel better.

150
00:19:09.66 --> 00:19:12.66
And it's like everything you do is criticized.

151
00:19:12.66 --> 00:19:19.82
And I just, I mean just with how that guy did it, it's just he did it on his terms.

152
00:19:19.82 --> 00:19:25.26
You know it's like it's a, yeah I mean it's a lonely road.

153
00:19:25.26 --> 00:19:33.58
I mean it's a lonely road and it's not just, it's not just, yeah I mean I'm nothing special.

154
00:19:33.58 --> 00:19:37.14
I don't look at myself as anything, as anything special.

155
00:19:37.14 --> 00:19:43.62
I did what I trained to do, I did what I put hope into people to do if they were in that

156
00:19:43.62 --> 00:19:45.14
situation.

157
00:19:45.14 --> 00:19:51.62
But you know it's just and it's, and honestly I think it's even worse today with everybody

158
00:19:51.62 --> 00:19:55.14
being able to, to watch how you live your life.

159
00:19:55.14 --> 00:19:57.58
Like more people have their eyes on you right?

160
00:19:57.58 --> 00:20:04.14
Like you know you get a guy who goes out and deals with PTSD or whatever you struggle

161
00:20:04.14 --> 00:20:05.14
in that day.

162
00:20:05.14 --> 00:20:10.66
I mean I'm scared, I won't even go, like I remember when I call my doctors if I need

163
00:20:10.66 --> 00:20:14.38
to go talk to somebody at therapist or something like I come up with a route of how I can

164
00:20:14.38 --> 00:20:18.86
go in the back door so nobody sees me so that they can publicize, oh look, look there's

165
00:20:18.86 --> 00:20:21.46
the code of going like there's something wrong with them.

166
00:20:21.46 --> 00:20:22.46
You know what I mean?

167
00:20:22.46 --> 00:20:30.70
Like it's just the standards are not, the grounds not equal now and it's just, yeah I mean.

168
00:20:30.70 --> 00:20:37.10
But also like you get a choice every day is a choice and it's like am I going to take this

169
00:20:37.10 --> 00:20:43.82
and try to get back and continue using the things that made me successful in that moment

170
00:20:43.82 --> 00:20:45.42
and apply it somewhere else.

171
00:20:45.42 --> 00:20:50.10
You know like the most of the film and I get is my daughters and whenever I'm trying to

172
00:20:50.10 --> 00:20:54.10
help people as a firefighter, like it's been the best thing for me.

173
00:20:54.10 --> 00:20:59.02
Like I'll, I'll never forget I, there was this guy and I, I talked about in the book,

174
00:20:59.02 --> 00:21:07.14
there was this was one of the first times I felt, if I felt real again almost and I'd

175
00:21:07.14 --> 00:21:10.18
help this guy and he didn't know who I was.

176
00:21:10.18 --> 00:21:12.06
He didn't know me for what I'd done.

177
00:21:12.06 --> 00:21:13.90
He didn't know my name.

178
00:21:13.90 --> 00:21:17.82
I was just a guy in the uniform and there when he needed help and he like thanked me and

179
00:21:17.82 --> 00:21:21.90
was so appreciative and I was like that feels good.

180
00:21:21.90 --> 00:21:22.90
That feels good.

181
00:21:22.90 --> 00:21:27.10
He didn't have any, any assumption of who I was or how I was.

182
00:21:27.10 --> 00:21:30.90
You know what I mean? Like that guy just needed that moment and I could be there for

183
00:21:30.90 --> 00:21:33.94
him and it shows me that I still got it.

184
00:21:33.94 --> 00:21:35.34
That I still got it.

185
00:21:35.34 --> 00:21:39.74
You know, because I mean you get off and like how long do you get out of the military?

186
00:21:39.74 --> 00:21:42.22
We've talked about this.

187
00:21:42.22 --> 00:21:48.86
How long do you get out of the military and you can still, you can still walk around with

188
00:21:48.86 --> 00:21:53.42
this, I'm a warrior, but you haven't even had to get in the ring.

189
00:21:53.42 --> 00:21:58.34
How long does that credibility still give you? I'm a warrior today.

190
00:21:58.34 --> 00:22:01.06
Not I was a warrior, but I am a warrior.

191
00:22:01.06 --> 00:22:05.02
How long do you get that credibility without getting in the ring?

192
00:22:05.02 --> 00:22:06.74
You know?

193
00:22:06.74 --> 00:22:08.70
And it's always a struggle.

194
00:22:08.70 --> 00:22:13.70
That's always a struggle is, do I still have it?

195
00:22:13.70 --> 00:22:15.58
Could I still do it?

196
00:22:15.58 --> 00:22:18.22
Could I still perform at that level?

197
00:22:18.22 --> 00:22:25.22
Because at the day you can't, you have to say I was a warrior.

198
00:22:25.22 --> 00:22:30.70
And it's like, I mean you have to be tested.

199
00:22:30.70 --> 00:22:34.50
And that's the one thing you talk to David Goggins, like that guy, he test himself all the

200
00:22:34.50 --> 00:22:35.50
time.

201
00:22:35.50 --> 00:22:37.94
He's always pushing it.

202
00:22:37.94 --> 00:22:42.30
But that's like, yeah, I mean that's the struggle is it's like, could I still?

203
00:22:42.30 --> 00:22:47.30
In the further I get away from that day in Afghanistan, you know, like I question myself

204
00:22:47.30 --> 00:22:50.90
all the time of, did I?

205
00:22:50.90 --> 00:22:52.38
How could I have done that that day?

206
00:22:52.38 --> 00:22:58.82
But like today I don't, to tell you I can't even, you know, get myself to have an up

207
00:22:58.82 --> 00:23:01.50
discipline to go work out.

208
00:23:01.50 --> 00:23:04.22
What happened to me?

209
00:23:04.22 --> 00:23:06.82
Do you know?

210
00:23:06.82 --> 00:23:16.34
So when you get done, like how long did it take for the, for the damn ceremonies and the

211
00:23:16.34 --> 00:23:22.30
round of interview, I remember you and I were talking on the phone, I forget when, but

212
00:23:22.30 --> 00:23:26.30
you were talking about like you were on 60 minutes, you were on all the, like every, what

213
00:23:26.30 --> 00:23:28.46
freaking lettermen, you did everything.

214
00:23:28.46 --> 00:23:32.74
How long did that last four?

215
00:23:32.74 --> 00:23:38.66
You know, like I was, I was like, it was really crazy all the way up to, I got it in September

216
00:23:38.66 --> 00:23:41.42
15th of 2011.

217
00:23:41.42 --> 00:23:43.10
Through December it was crazy.

218
00:23:43.10 --> 00:23:50.54
I mean, I was on the view 60 minutes CBS Sunday morning, Fox all the time, I was on, obviously

219
00:23:50.54 --> 00:23:54.02
Letterman, J. Leno, I mean, you got everything.

220
00:23:54.02 --> 00:23:57.06
You got down down a list.

221
00:23:57.06 --> 00:23:59.06
And it was, I mean, it was crazy.

222
00:23:59.06 --> 00:24:00.06
It was crazy.

223
00:24:00.06 --> 00:24:05.26
And it's still like speeches kept going, like, I mean, you still walk out places and

224
00:24:05.26 --> 00:24:10.02
people recognize you and, you know, everybody's coming at you and wanting you and this and that.

225
00:24:10.02 --> 00:24:13.54
And it was, it took me, I got hated it.

226
00:24:13.54 --> 00:24:17.82
I was, I mean, I, when I hear people say, hey, I met you back in, but anytime I'm like,

227
00:24:17.82 --> 00:24:22.86
when you meet me, and people was between 2011 and 2014, I apologize.

228
00:24:22.86 --> 00:24:24.58
First, I said, I'm sorry.

229
00:24:24.58 --> 00:24:25.58
I'm sorry.

230
00:24:25.58 --> 00:24:26.82
I was drunk the whole time.

231
00:24:26.82 --> 00:24:27.58
I hated it.

232
00:24:27.58 --> 00:24:28.58
I got hated it.

233
00:24:28.58 --> 00:24:32.26
Like there would be times, it like, so I had a whole team around me.

234
00:24:32.26 --> 00:24:36.66
The Marine Corps sent, like right after a day and now I'm starting to get in the middle.

235
00:24:36.66 --> 00:24:42.66
The Marine Corps sent out like seven people to live with me, 24, 7.

236
00:24:42.66 --> 00:24:45.22
What would they, what would they do with it?

237
00:24:45.22 --> 00:24:49.46
I had a security guy that stayed in my house.

238
00:24:49.46 --> 00:24:58.54
Like he stayed, I wasn't anywhere by myself for probably 90 days, at least 120 days.

239
00:24:58.54 --> 00:25:01.94
And a guy live with me.

240
00:25:01.94 --> 00:25:06.62
They sent in like, there were PR people, PAO people.

241
00:25:06.62 --> 00:25:10.98
There was three of them, and you're 23 years old.

242
00:25:10.98 --> 00:25:12.46
Twenty-three years old.

243
00:25:12.46 --> 00:25:13.86
How was Ty and Steve?

244
00:25:13.86 --> 00:25:15.46
There's, there's, there's interviews.

245
00:25:15.46 --> 00:25:18.06
You go on the internet and there's interviews.

246
00:25:18.06 --> 00:25:19.50
So they sent divids out, right?

247
00:25:19.50 --> 00:25:25.70
So like the DOD, the Marine Corps, like combat camera people, like capturing this.

248
00:25:25.70 --> 00:25:27.90
There are images of like, I, I refuse.

249
00:25:27.90 --> 00:25:30.38
I'm like, no, it's not changing my life.

250
00:25:30.38 --> 00:25:33.74
And I'm literally on a skid steer, like working under a skid steer and they're interviewing

251
00:25:33.74 --> 00:25:37.18
me because they had to get something and I would not stop.

252
00:25:37.18 --> 00:25:39.34
I'm like, no, you can follow me, but that's it.

253
00:25:39.34 --> 00:25:44.14
So they would get up and follow me to go work at yards and stuff all day long.

254
00:25:44.14 --> 00:25:45.62
But yeah, I mean, so I had all that.

255
00:25:45.62 --> 00:25:50.74
And I mean, it was just like a, you know, my whole life changed.

256
00:25:50.74 --> 00:25:54.46
And, and then, you know, it like everything was good.

257
00:25:54.46 --> 00:25:55.54
It's like they built me up.

258
00:25:55.54 --> 00:25:59.74
Like, I was, I couldn't do anything wrong.

259
00:25:59.74 --> 00:26:03.06
And it's like when they got you to the top of the mountain, it was like the pinniat

260
00:26:03.06 --> 00:26:04.70
that they raised up.

261
00:26:04.70 --> 00:26:08.98
And then it was just like, here came the media, just as soon as you said something wrong.

262
00:26:08.98 --> 00:26:11.50
Or, I mean, they were just, it's the gotchas.

263
00:26:11.50 --> 00:26:15.54
And it was like, it was like, they just build you up to just try to smash you down, right?

264
00:26:15.54 --> 00:26:20.82
And there was always this one reporter who was there.

265
00:26:20.82 --> 00:26:22.22
They just always want to take me to task.

266
00:26:22.22 --> 00:26:26.10
So it's like, you just got, you had to, you just start, you take these beatons, right?

267
00:26:26.10 --> 00:26:29.46
And, and like, you know, like, people like, all do cares.

268
00:26:29.46 --> 00:26:31.54
Who cares what they say about you?

269
00:26:31.54 --> 00:26:35.14
Well, there's only one thing I've gotten this life.

270
00:26:35.14 --> 00:26:37.66
And that's my name and reputation.

271
00:26:37.66 --> 00:26:44.10
That's the only, like, when I die on my tombstone, it's not going to have any of my awards.

272
00:26:44.10 --> 00:26:49.06
It's not going to have anything, but the day I was born and the day I died, and it's

273
00:26:49.06 --> 00:26:52.62
going to say, myr at the top of it.

274
00:26:52.62 --> 00:26:54.30
And that's what people are going to know.

275
00:26:54.30 --> 00:26:56.14
But that's my brand.

276
00:26:56.14 --> 00:27:01.34
And so I took it serious, like, when I would come home and I remember I landed one

277
00:27:01.34 --> 00:27:05.02
night and I landed really late in Louisville.

278
00:27:05.02 --> 00:27:13.06
And I was driving home and the career journal had released on the front page across the

279
00:27:13.06 --> 00:27:16.94
state, because I remember I pulled into this gas station in my hometown.

280
00:27:16.94 --> 00:27:17.94
And it was across the state.

281
00:27:17.94 --> 00:27:23.42
And it was metal of this honor with my page on the front page of the state paper, right?

282
00:27:23.42 --> 00:27:26.42
And they were trying to spread it everything that I had done.

283
00:27:26.42 --> 00:27:30.66
And it was so bad that my friends got up.

284
00:27:30.66 --> 00:27:32.54
Like they found out about it.

285
00:27:32.54 --> 00:27:37.06
And they got up and they went and bought all the papers out in town.

286
00:27:37.06 --> 00:27:38.90
And it was just always something man.

287
00:27:38.90 --> 00:27:45.34
And it's just like, you just can't, there's no rhyme or reason to it.

288
00:27:45.34 --> 00:27:51.42
You know, and it's just a, yeah, I mean, you get isolated.

289
00:27:51.42 --> 00:27:53.42
So I get, I get what that guy said.

290
00:27:53.42 --> 00:27:58.06
You know, what that guy did.

291
00:27:58.06 --> 00:28:04.30
I mean, sometimes you just, you know, what if I can't help people and make a difference,

292
00:28:04.30 --> 00:28:06.58
what am I doing?

293
00:28:06.58 --> 00:28:09.74
What are you doing?

294
00:28:09.74 --> 00:28:15.10
So you say the like the hype train lasted from September to December.

295
00:28:15.10 --> 00:28:18.94
And I mean, at some point, does all the sudden, those seven Marines that were there

296
00:28:18.94 --> 00:28:24.18
watching their remove all sudden, like their, their duties over, we got my, are done with

297
00:28:24.18 --> 00:28:26.14
whatever he need to get done.

298
00:28:26.14 --> 00:28:30.06
Yeah. And then like one day you wake up and like, they're alone.

299
00:28:30.06 --> 00:28:35.34
Yeah. So we were supposed to go to, so we did at East Coast West Coast, and we're supposed

300
00:28:35.34 --> 00:28:36.34
to Hawaii tour.

301
00:28:36.34 --> 00:28:40.54
So it's like a, we were like a weekend in New York.

302
00:28:40.54 --> 00:28:42.18
And then a week in California.

303
00:28:42.18 --> 00:28:46.38
And then we were supposed to go to Hawaii for like a week to do press and all this,

304
00:28:46.38 --> 00:28:50.78
right, see the bases and do the press on each coast.

305
00:28:50.78 --> 00:28:53.06
And we went to New York.

306
00:28:53.06 --> 00:28:57.50
Did that. So like I got the medal, came home.

307
00:28:57.50 --> 00:29:01.70
And then the week after that, this was when all this started.

308
00:29:01.70 --> 00:29:06.02
And by the time I hit California, I'm like, I'm out.

309
00:29:06.02 --> 00:29:08.78
Like I, I'm on the plane to California from New York to California.

310
00:29:08.78 --> 00:29:10.10
I said, I can't, I'm out.

311
00:29:10.10 --> 00:29:11.90
I can't keep doing this.

312
00:29:11.90 --> 00:29:14.06
Um, and so that was it.

313
00:29:14.06 --> 00:29:18.50
Like, what was it that made you feel like you're like, the people just constantly talking

314
00:29:18.50 --> 00:29:22.02
to you. I mean, was it just, you feel like you're put up on a pedestal.

315
00:29:22.02 --> 00:29:25.30
We talked about this the first time you're on here.

316
00:29:25.30 --> 00:29:30.54
I mean, basically everyone's saying, hey, good job.

317
00:29:30.54 --> 00:29:39.94
I mean, you got to take this like, I am literally known for the biggest failure of my life.

318
00:29:39.94 --> 00:29:46.22
Like you, you can't change the narrative to like, that's where people get wrongness

319
00:29:46.22 --> 00:29:50.26
or like, well, like they just defy stuff in their head.

320
00:29:50.26 --> 00:29:53.62
The facts are this like you can't change the facts.

321
00:29:53.62 --> 00:29:55.78
All my team is dead.

322
00:29:55.78 --> 00:29:57.78
Like I didn't get them out.

323
00:29:57.78 --> 00:30:00.82
Whether it was rational or not.

324
00:30:00.82 --> 00:30:04.70
Somebody can say, I'm gonna do 10,000 push-ups today and they're trying to break

325
00:30:04.70 --> 00:30:06.02
against book a world record.

326
00:30:06.02 --> 00:30:10.18
Nobody looks at him and says, well, you did, you did 500 in hour.

327
00:30:10.18 --> 00:30:11.58
That's good enough.

328
00:30:11.58 --> 00:30:13.86
They failed.

329
00:30:13.86 --> 00:30:16.30
I failed.

330
00:30:16.30 --> 00:30:17.46
My team answered dead.

331
00:30:17.46 --> 00:30:20.66
Their families has, unanswered questions.

332
00:30:20.66 --> 00:30:26.54
There's, there's four kids that don't ever see their dad.

333
00:30:26.54 --> 00:30:32.46
And I'm getting preyed around the nation as a hero.

334
00:30:32.46 --> 00:30:36.70
And it's like I look at all these other mental, like all the other mental alarmers guys.

335
00:30:36.70 --> 00:30:41.22
And I'm away from them because, you know, I get, look, call carpentry.

336
00:30:41.22 --> 00:30:43.22
I couldn't imagine what that kid got through.

337
00:30:43.22 --> 00:30:45.34
Like you talk about a guy that's a warrior.

338
00:30:45.34 --> 00:30:47.34
That kid's a warrior.

339
00:30:47.34 --> 00:30:50.10
I don't have anything like that.

340
00:30:50.10 --> 00:30:57.98
But I tell these guys that like, you guys did some bad-ass stuff.

341
00:30:57.98 --> 00:31:01.18
You guys did bad-ass stuff.

342
00:31:01.18 --> 00:31:04.90
And you got some guys that enjoy it with.

343
00:31:04.90 --> 00:31:08.18
I come home and I ain't got anybody.

344
00:31:08.18 --> 00:31:10.86
And it's literally the biggest failure of my life.

345
00:31:10.86 --> 00:31:13.62
Now with that I've learned a lot.

346
00:31:13.62 --> 00:31:18.18
And I can't change the narrative because it doesn't feel good.

347
00:31:18.18 --> 00:31:22.38
And you started, you started feeling this way while you're flying from New York, California.

348
00:31:22.38 --> 00:31:26.02
Like, I mean, I, I told the president that I couldn't accept the metal.

349
00:31:26.02 --> 00:31:28.74
I wanted him to break it down to a Navy Cross.

350
00:31:28.74 --> 00:31:34.18
I told him I couldn't accept the metal because like he said, you're, I'll never forget

351
00:31:34.18 --> 00:31:36.74
President Obama told me that I was a hero.

352
00:31:36.74 --> 00:31:41.26
And I said, if you think I'm such a hero, why don't you call my teammates up and get

353
00:31:41.26 --> 00:31:46.66
their opinion, go let them know I'm a hero.

354
00:31:46.66 --> 00:31:48.98
And I'm not.

355
00:31:48.98 --> 00:31:52.34
And that's why like, that's why when these people are like trying to discredit or they're

356
00:31:52.34 --> 00:31:56.26
trying to say, oh, you know, whatever, I mean, I can't argue with them.

357
00:31:56.26 --> 00:31:59.62
I, you talk about getting my ass kicked.

358
00:31:59.62 --> 00:32:04.02
Like I got a metal of honor for getting my ass kicked.

359
00:32:04.02 --> 00:32:10.94
And so I just, I couldn't keep living this in the media of like, it just, it was a

360
00:32:10.94 --> 00:32:13.90
hard thing like, I just wasn't there yet, right?

361
00:32:13.90 --> 00:32:15.78
Now I don't do it about me.

362
00:32:15.78 --> 00:32:17.58
I do it about my teammates, right?

363
00:32:17.58 --> 00:32:21.42
Like I do it to try to show these lessons.

364
00:32:21.42 --> 00:32:25.70
If, hey, you know, I come to this point to where I wasn't going to change it.

365
00:32:25.70 --> 00:32:27.46
I wasn't going to be able to get away from it.

366
00:32:27.46 --> 00:32:32.10
You know, it was like, and so how do I use it to make a difference?

367
00:32:32.10 --> 00:32:36.46
How do I try to turn something so terrible into something good?

368
00:32:36.46 --> 00:32:37.94
And that's what I ended up having to do.

369
00:32:37.94 --> 00:32:41.82
But yeah, I got off like on the plane to, it was on the plane to L.A.

370
00:32:41.82 --> 00:32:43.86
It was on the plane from New York to L.A.

371
00:32:43.86 --> 00:32:47.34
And I remember looking at the girl who was running all my stuff.

372
00:32:47.34 --> 00:32:48.70
She was, she's a rock star.

373
00:32:48.70 --> 00:32:52.26
You talk about a girl who she is a rock star.

374
00:32:52.26 --> 00:32:56.30
And I said, we were done.

375
00:32:56.30 --> 00:32:57.30
We're done.

376
00:32:57.30 --> 00:33:00.10
We'll finish these interviews here, but we're not going to lie.

377
00:33:00.10 --> 00:33:01.46
And I'm going home.

378
00:33:01.46 --> 00:33:03.14
And landed.

379
00:33:03.14 --> 00:33:05.94
We did the stuff we had doing in L.A.

380
00:33:05.94 --> 00:33:08.38
I flew home from there.

381
00:33:08.38 --> 00:33:12.38
And then I was still doing events and still doing what people wanted me to.

382
00:33:12.38 --> 00:33:15.78
I had a scholarship fund with the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation.

383
00:33:15.78 --> 00:33:20.18
I had this challenge to America where we would raise a million dollars to put kids

384
00:33:20.18 --> 00:33:21.18
through college.

385
00:33:21.18 --> 00:33:26.30
So like I was going out and speaking of events for that to like go into private dinners

386
00:33:26.30 --> 00:33:29.62
to where somebody would write a huge check to the scholarship foundation.

387
00:33:29.62 --> 00:33:30.62
So I was doing that.

388
00:33:30.62 --> 00:33:35.90
And then yeah, no, I didn't have any, nobody taught me.

389
00:33:35.90 --> 00:33:41.42
What I should do, what I shouldn't do, you know, it was like 23 years old just thrown

390
00:33:41.42 --> 00:33:47.06
to this machine that, I mean, I didn't even have an Instagram at the time.

391
00:33:47.06 --> 00:33:48.06
Right?

392
00:33:48.06 --> 00:33:49.58
Like I didn't know what to do.

393
00:33:49.58 --> 00:33:53.06
And so yeah, I mean, I did that.

394
00:33:53.06 --> 00:33:57.82
I was on the speaking, like I did speaking with leading authorities.

395
00:33:57.82 --> 00:34:01.30
Broke my book with being West in 2012.

396
00:34:01.30 --> 00:34:04.82
And you know, like speeches kept going and like events and things like that.

397
00:34:04.82 --> 00:34:11.22
And but you just kind of just kind of going with the flow of what's next, right?

398
00:34:11.22 --> 00:34:13.98
And yeah, I didn't see it.

399
00:34:13.98 --> 00:34:16.58
Was the Marine Corps when you said, hey, look, I'm not going to Hawaii.

400
00:34:16.58 --> 00:34:17.58
Where I'm done.

401
00:34:17.58 --> 00:34:18.58
I'm done.

402
00:34:18.58 --> 00:34:25.34
Was the Marine Corps thinking or did anybody say, okay, hey, maybe we need to give Dakota some

403
00:34:25.34 --> 00:34:31.90
help to get through this because he's got a massive amount of guilt over what happened.

404
00:34:31.90 --> 00:34:34.50
Did anybody talk to you along those lines at all?

405
00:34:34.50 --> 00:34:37.38
So the Marine Corps didn't know what to do either.

406
00:34:37.38 --> 00:34:38.38
Right?

407
00:34:38.38 --> 00:34:43.26
Like I was the first living Marine since Vietnam to receive the Medal of Honor.

408
00:34:43.26 --> 00:34:47.46
So they weren't really schooled up on it either.

409
00:34:47.46 --> 00:34:56.62
And there was one mistake that they made from the beginning is, and they tried to put it

410
00:34:56.62 --> 00:34:57.62
together.

411
00:34:57.62 --> 00:35:02.94
But when they put the narrative together, this is what opened us up to the media to the

412
00:35:02.94 --> 00:35:09.54
guy who actually was the reporter that was actually the one that just was trying to

413
00:35:09.54 --> 00:35:11.26
discredit everything.

414
00:35:11.26 --> 00:35:12.26
And this was his heart.

415
00:35:12.26 --> 00:35:14.06
This is a piece of your hand on.

416
00:35:14.06 --> 00:35:20.30
But like in the first initial write up they had to do, right?

417
00:35:20.30 --> 00:35:27.06
They put numbers in of how many people were rescued or say, whatever you want to call it.

418
00:35:27.06 --> 00:35:31.74
And how many people I killed?

419
00:35:31.74 --> 00:35:39.22
Which opened it up to numbers, which a doesn't matter, and b opens it up.

420
00:35:39.22 --> 00:35:40.22
Right?

421
00:35:40.22 --> 00:35:41.22
Because it doesn't really matter.

422
00:35:41.22 --> 00:35:46.34
Did you kill 28 people or 72 people or 172 people?

423
00:35:46.34 --> 00:35:47.66
It's like it doesn't really matter.

424
00:35:47.66 --> 00:35:48.66
Wait, wait.

425
00:35:48.66 --> 00:35:49.66
Did you save?

426
00:35:49.66 --> 00:35:52.50
Because you can get a Medal of Honor for saving one person.

427
00:35:52.50 --> 00:35:55.82
You can get a Medal of Honor for killing one person.

428
00:35:55.82 --> 00:35:58.58
You can get a Medal of Honor for saving 100 or killing 100.

429
00:35:58.58 --> 00:35:59.70
That's not what it's about.

430
00:35:59.70 --> 00:36:03.94
But if they opened it up for that, all of a sudden they make it matter.

431
00:36:03.94 --> 00:36:06.30
And that was where it messed up.

432
00:36:06.30 --> 00:36:10.62
And I think they started the negative stuff started coming out.

433
00:36:10.62 --> 00:36:11.82
And that was where.

434
00:36:11.82 --> 00:36:15.50
But like the reporter even says in his article, there's an article out there about

435
00:36:15.50 --> 00:36:17.10
how it was quite a few.

436
00:36:17.10 --> 00:36:24.90
But he even states he goes, he states all these things, these discrepancies.

437
00:36:24.90 --> 00:36:28.06
But he goes, I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it.

438
00:36:28.06 --> 00:36:29.62
I actually read that article.

439
00:36:29.62 --> 00:36:35.18
He said he says something along the lines of not that these actions alone don't fully

440
00:36:35.18 --> 00:36:36.98
warrant the Medal of Honor.

441
00:36:36.98 --> 00:36:39.02
So what the hell are you doing?

442
00:36:39.02 --> 00:36:40.02
Yeah.

443
00:36:40.02 --> 00:36:45.86
So it's those things that like, you know, I got like me and like you, you've had to talk

444
00:36:45.86 --> 00:36:46.86
me down.

445
00:36:46.86 --> 00:36:50.30
I got like me all I've known my whole life.

446
00:36:50.30 --> 00:36:53.14
Like there's only one thing I'm good at.

447
00:36:53.14 --> 00:36:54.62
And it's fighting.

448
00:36:54.62 --> 00:36:55.94
It's all I know.

449
00:36:55.94 --> 00:36:59.94
Like I have been, it's all I know.

450
00:36:59.94 --> 00:37:00.94
You know what I mean?

451
00:37:00.94 --> 00:37:04.54
Like it's the only thing that's made me successful anything is that I was willing to fight

452
00:37:04.54 --> 00:37:06.54
and I was willing to work.

453
00:37:06.54 --> 00:37:14.90
And you put those things in a spot where there's people who are poking.

454
00:37:14.90 --> 00:37:19.86
It's not a good thing, right?

455
00:37:19.86 --> 00:37:23.90
And so like I had to back up, you know, get myself together.

456
00:37:23.90 --> 00:37:26.62
I was drinking too much like I was just trying to deal with all of it.

457
00:37:26.62 --> 00:37:30.98
I mean, imagine walking into a room and everybody wants to talk to you about the worst

458
00:37:30.98 --> 00:37:33.50
day of your life.

459
00:37:33.50 --> 00:37:39.98
Like over and over and over and it's like you don't have to.

460
00:37:39.98 --> 00:37:42.42
It's not about going home and not dreaming about it.

461
00:37:42.42 --> 00:37:49.10
It's about I'm walking into rooms and I'm sitting here literally reliving it over and over

462
00:37:49.10 --> 00:37:55.58
which is okay.

463
00:37:55.58 --> 00:38:02.22
But I just think that like sometimes the worst day of my life is somebody else's entertainment.

464
00:38:02.22 --> 00:38:07.10
I wish I would have pulled this quote major wittlessly.

465
00:38:07.10 --> 00:38:09.34
He was at like a dinner and spoke at the dinner.

466
00:38:09.34 --> 00:38:11.78
He sits down with his friends and the friends were talking.

467
00:38:11.78 --> 00:38:18.06
They said something along the lines of he said exactly what you just said.

468
00:38:18.06 --> 00:38:25.06
He said something along the lines of every time I talk about this, I go right back there

469
00:38:25.06 --> 00:38:27.06
and I can't get away from it.

470
00:38:27.06 --> 00:38:37.82
Yeah, like yeah, I mean, I just, I mean, look, I still today, I miss my guys.

471
00:38:37.82 --> 00:38:45.38
I mean, you know, I just seen that one of my, like one of my teammates, his daughters,

472
00:38:45.38 --> 00:38:51.74
you know, she's about to have a baby and you know, you just, it's just, it's crazy.

473
00:38:51.74 --> 00:38:52.74
You know what I mean?

474
00:38:52.74 --> 00:38:57.30
It's like, I get to sit here and enjoy my two beautiful daughters who are more than I ever

475
00:38:57.30 --> 00:38:58.30
deserve.

476
00:38:58.30 --> 00:39:04.82
I get to hang around such amazing people and I get to live a beautiful life and all these

477
00:39:04.82 --> 00:39:12.86
things and, you know, it's just it's not, it's not a fair world, you know?

478
00:39:12.86 --> 00:39:13.86
It's not.

479
00:39:13.86 --> 00:39:17.34
That's, that was always a thing, you know, struggle for me to deal with and, you know,

480
00:39:17.34 --> 00:39:20.06
and how do you give back, how do you continue to give back, right?

481
00:39:20.06 --> 00:39:21.06
Like what?

482
00:39:21.06 --> 00:39:25.58
Look, I mean, yeah, how do you get back, right?

483
00:39:25.58 --> 00:39:28.74
So yeah, so like the Marine Corps left, they went on their own way.

484
00:39:28.74 --> 00:39:30.22
Honestly, they kind of separated from me.

485
00:39:30.22 --> 00:39:34.26
I didn't hear much from them again.

486
00:39:34.26 --> 00:39:36.02
Probably two and a half, two and a half years.

487
00:39:36.02 --> 00:39:38.02
I didn't hear much from them.

488
00:39:38.02 --> 00:39:40.06
It was like mission complete for them.

489
00:39:40.06 --> 00:39:42.62
It was like, hey, let's separate from this because I don't know if this thing's going to

490
00:39:42.62 --> 00:39:46.54
be a hangar-nade or, you know, what's going to happen?

491
00:39:46.54 --> 00:39:52.46
Isn't it weird, you know, you said earlier, like, for this guy, you said it's worse today,

492
00:39:52.46 --> 00:39:53.46
right?

493
00:39:53.46 --> 00:39:58.06
Because everyone, there's, you know, word travel so fast and all this stuff.

494
00:39:58.06 --> 00:40:05.58
But you would think, man, like, that least people understand the concept of survivor guilt

495
00:40:05.58 --> 00:40:11.50
and post-traumatic stress, like at least we understand those things.

496
00:40:11.50 --> 00:40:16.18
And yet, it seems like, you know, if I, when someone goes through something like this,

497
00:40:16.18 --> 00:40:18.82
you've got to like give them some support, you know?

498
00:40:18.82 --> 00:40:22.46
Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah.

499
00:40:22.46 --> 00:40:27.62
But you know, like, how do you do that when everybody looks at you like a hero?

500
00:40:27.62 --> 00:40:33.66
I mean, how many times have you been in a situation with a group of people knowing them

501
00:40:33.66 --> 00:40:38.66
well that you all, you're all scared as it gets?

502
00:40:38.66 --> 00:40:44.86
And, but it's like, as long as you keep your poker face on, you could literally be the

503
00:40:44.86 --> 00:40:50.18
thing that breaks them, where everybody's going to be like, no, you just confirmed their

504
00:40:50.18 --> 00:40:55.26
fears or you, you are the thing that keeps them going.

505
00:40:55.26 --> 00:41:08.62
And, you know, I, I just always took it as, this is my, I got the medal.

506
00:41:08.62 --> 00:41:14.06
And that's my punishment for letting my teammates get killed.

507
00:41:14.06 --> 00:41:21.02
This is my punishment to be paraded in front of all the people as a hero, the exact opposite

508
00:41:21.02 --> 00:41:22.86
of what I am.

509
00:41:22.86 --> 00:41:25.26
And that was, that was my punishment.

510
00:41:25.26 --> 00:41:30.70
That was what the universe or God, whoever you want to think about, this was, this was

511
00:41:30.70 --> 00:41:35.30
what I got for failing that day.

512
00:41:35.30 --> 00:41:40.26
And that was, that was kind of how it was, you know.

513
00:41:40.26 --> 00:41:44.22
And so like any time I got to give a speech or talk to people and tell them the realities

514
00:41:44.22 --> 00:41:47.98
of it, you know, I just wanted to know that hey, look, you can get your ass kicked and

515
00:41:47.98 --> 00:41:49.74
get back up from it.

516
00:41:49.74 --> 00:41:51.38
And that's what the story is.

517
00:41:51.38 --> 00:41:57.98
My story is not a story of a guy who is some high speed, low drag.

518
00:41:57.98 --> 00:42:03.82
You know, my story is a story of a guy who got his ass kicked and his hat is ass kicked,

519
00:42:03.82 --> 00:42:09.86
his whole life and has, who lives a life of success.

520
00:42:09.86 --> 00:42:15.86
He has found a way to make success out of a shit ton of failures.

521
00:42:15.86 --> 00:42:19.26
And that's kind of, that's kind of what it is, you know.

522
00:42:19.26 --> 00:42:22.26
But yeah, the Marine Corps went away and then I started hiring my own people.

523
00:42:22.26 --> 00:42:24.78
He was a hired new old people, kind of people.

524
00:42:24.78 --> 00:42:27.26
So like I had agents, right?

525
00:42:27.26 --> 00:42:33.50
So I had a book agent, a book and movie agent with ICM Sloan Sloan Harris.

526
00:42:33.50 --> 00:42:35.58
It was a great guy.

527
00:42:35.58 --> 00:42:42.54
I had, you know, obviously with the speaking agency, I had security people like that

528
00:42:42.54 --> 00:42:47.74
I would keep on me and not really for anything other than to protect me from myself, right?

529
00:42:47.74 --> 00:42:52.58
Like, because you know, I walked in, I mean, I would walk in somewhere and like, we'd

530
00:42:52.58 --> 00:42:55.54
be drinking and somebody would say something, I would hit him.

531
00:42:55.54 --> 00:42:57.18
You know what?

532
00:42:57.18 --> 00:42:58.18
That's a lawsuit now.

533
00:42:58.18 --> 00:43:00.50
You know what I mean?

534
00:43:00.50 --> 00:43:04.78
I had, you know, assistance, I mean, you know, people who were kind of handled me to

535
00:43:04.78 --> 00:43:06.14
get me what I need to be.

536
00:43:06.14 --> 00:43:10.46
I mean, it was, it was a crazy, it was a crazy time.

537
00:43:10.46 --> 00:43:12.58
I mean, it was crazy.

538
00:43:12.58 --> 00:43:16.10
And that was all the way up until probably 2014.

539
00:43:16.10 --> 00:43:20.66
And then, and then I just, I kind of just, I was like, I just want to get away from it.

540
00:43:20.66 --> 00:43:21.66
And I started backing off.

541
00:43:21.66 --> 00:43:25.50
And you know, I was so fortunate that I've been with Toyota since 2011.

542
00:43:25.50 --> 00:43:30.22
And you know, you talk about Ed Loutkiss and you talk about Don Esman and you talk about,

543
00:43:30.22 --> 00:43:37.50
like, all these incredible people inside of Toyota, like these people, like met me and

544
00:43:37.50 --> 00:43:38.62
they've mentored me the whole way.

545
00:43:38.62 --> 00:43:43.66
Like you talk about sticking with me through thick and thin and believing in a cause of,

546
00:43:43.66 --> 00:43:51.58
of, you know, of helping veterans and just, like you take them out of, out of, you know,

547
00:43:51.58 --> 00:43:57.98
if I had to met them in 2012, there's no time where I'd be.

548
00:43:57.98 --> 00:44:01.06
So those guys were kind of helping you guy, guy, do you through all this?

549
00:44:01.06 --> 00:44:03.06
And former Marines.

550
00:44:03.06 --> 00:44:04.58
So Don Esman was a Marine.

551
00:44:04.58 --> 00:44:06.58
He was a Vietnam pilot and Vietnam.

552
00:44:06.58 --> 00:44:09.50
He was a Metavac pilot.

553
00:44:09.50 --> 00:44:13.98
So he's got over 900 missions shot down Silver Star recipient.

554
00:44:13.98 --> 00:44:21.82
I mean, but he was, he was the, I think it was the COO of Toyota.

555
00:44:21.82 --> 00:44:27.50
And we, you know, I got in contact with them and they brought me on.

556
00:44:27.50 --> 00:44:32.06
They, they got what this program called hiring or heroes that I work with and helping veterans

557
00:44:32.06 --> 00:44:37.10
get back to work and, but it was more personal for them.

558
00:44:37.10 --> 00:44:38.66
It wasn't a business thing for them.

559
00:44:38.66 --> 00:44:45.98
Like they took me in and, you know, Ed Lakis, his mom and dad both were in World War II and

560
00:44:45.98 --> 00:44:46.98
Marines.

561
00:44:46.98 --> 00:44:50.22
And so it was just like, it was crazy how I got there, Tune.

562
00:44:50.22 --> 00:44:55.50
And they, you know, gosh, you talk about 2011, 2012 Dakota.

563
00:44:55.50 --> 00:45:00.58
Yeah, yeah, yeah, because that when you were the hand grenade that the Marine called

564
00:45:00.58 --> 00:45:02.58
this scared you were.

565
00:45:02.58 --> 00:45:08.30
Yes, you, you, you, you take those people out of my life, you know, John Lisco.

566
00:45:08.30 --> 00:45:11.78
And they didn't have to do it.

567
00:45:11.78 --> 00:45:13.74
And, you know, you just find these people.

568
00:45:13.74 --> 00:45:19.94
Yeah, you know, when you say these people, like, helped you out, there's always people

569
00:45:19.94 --> 00:45:23.74
that ask me, hey, how can we help veterans?

570
00:45:23.74 --> 00:45:27.66
And you know, it's really easy to say, like, give to charity, which is awesome for sure.

571
00:45:27.66 --> 00:45:35.18
But in terms of what is helpful and what you're talking about is like, actually form relationships

572
00:45:35.18 --> 00:45:39.42
with people so that you can see where you can help them and you can provide them the help

573
00:45:39.42 --> 00:45:40.66
and support that they need.

574
00:45:40.66 --> 00:45:41.66
Yeah.

575
00:45:41.66 --> 00:45:44.66
There's a big difference between me right in a check and saying, okay, I feel better

576
00:45:44.66 --> 00:45:49.54
about myself because I wrote a check to whatever foundation, which again, that's good.

577
00:45:49.54 --> 00:45:55.66
But if you want to go next level, form some relationships with some people and look,

578
00:45:55.66 --> 00:46:00.02
veterans have, especially like you, like me when I was young, right?

579
00:46:00.02 --> 00:46:02.78
You have no, I didn't really have any experience in the world, right?

580
00:46:02.78 --> 00:46:03.78
I was institutionalized.

581
00:46:03.78 --> 00:46:07.98
It was just, I just knew the military, that's me, that's my life.

582
00:46:07.98 --> 00:46:14.94
So if I would have gotten out when I was 23, 24 years old, I would know what to do.

583
00:46:14.94 --> 00:46:17.94
So someone that's a civilian, that's a little older.

584
00:46:17.94 --> 00:46:23.98
If you form a relationship with someone and look, I can tell you, it's not going to be

585
00:46:23.98 --> 00:46:24.98
easy.

586
00:46:24.98 --> 00:46:30.74
I can almost guarantee that being trying to mentor a guide 23 year old, the color,

587
00:46:30.74 --> 00:46:36.38
there's going to be challenges like it's like having a free continued boy.

588
00:46:36.38 --> 00:46:38.94
That's old enough to drink and has money.

589
00:46:38.94 --> 00:46:39.94
Yeah.

590
00:46:39.94 --> 00:46:40.94
Yes.

591
00:46:40.94 --> 00:46:41.94
Yeah.

592
00:46:41.94 --> 00:46:43.70
And that was it, right?

593
00:46:43.70 --> 00:46:48.06
You know, you talk about Ed, I mean, I go back, keep talking about Ed Larkis and

594
00:46:48.06 --> 00:46:52.94
you talk about a guy who just, I mean, he was like a second dad, you know what I mean?

595
00:46:52.94 --> 00:46:57.06
Like he, you know, it's wife Karen, just, I mean, I actually, I just call her mom, you know?

596
00:46:57.06 --> 00:47:00.82
And you talk about Ed, you know, they went out of their way and I was so lucky.

597
00:47:00.82 --> 00:47:06.22
But you know, that's the one thing that I have to say, if I've ever been good at, you know,

598
00:47:06.22 --> 00:47:13.34
all the way growing up, I've always been able to find, um, great.

599
00:47:13.34 --> 00:47:18.46
Like I've always had this way of finding great people and knowing who good people were,

600
00:47:18.46 --> 00:47:24.94
who I should try to be like, I was really good at figuring those out and making them believe

601
00:47:24.94 --> 00:47:25.94
in me, right?

602
00:47:25.94 --> 00:47:31.86
Like I was, that that's the only, that's the only power I really have is, is that I can,

603
00:47:31.86 --> 00:47:37.66
I know who's, who's really good in the room and who's, who's, who I should be like.

604
00:47:37.66 --> 00:47:41.30
And I find a way to get them to help get me there.

605
00:47:41.30 --> 00:47:46.10
And then always having great mentors, I've had that from day one.

606
00:47:46.10 --> 00:47:50.46
I've been, I've been so fortunate to have that, right?

607
00:47:50.46 --> 00:47:54.86
And that's what's got me, I mean, even still today, even still today, that's the pieces

608
00:47:54.86 --> 00:48:00.34
that keep me going and keep getting me better and keep helping me grow and learn and develop.

609
00:48:00.34 --> 00:48:05.74
You know, and that's, that's been my key to success or whatever you call it to, to still being

610
00:48:05.74 --> 00:48:07.42
here, right?

611
00:48:07.42 --> 00:48:15.50
Is those people, you know, I'm just a, I'm just a product of the people who are around me.

612
00:48:15.50 --> 00:48:22.02
They should get the credit for any success as I have, you know, and that's how it is.

613
00:48:22.02 --> 00:48:26.78
So when you, when you, in the book into the fire, you, you, by me, you had the lowest

614
00:48:26.78 --> 00:48:27.78
of low points, right?

615
00:48:27.78 --> 00:48:33.46
You're in your freaking truck and you're, you basically try and kill yourself, but luckily

616
00:48:33.46 --> 00:48:38.94
someone pulled around out of the, pulled around out of the chamber.

617
00:48:38.94 --> 00:48:42.34
So your, your weapon wasn't chambered.

618
00:48:42.34 --> 00:48:44.90
Round wasn't chambered.

619
00:48:44.90 --> 00:48:46.14
Then you get the metal.

620
00:48:46.14 --> 00:48:49.86
Then you're on like a, there's a little lift, you're getting the metal, you're getting

621
00:48:49.86 --> 00:48:51.74
all this attention.

622
00:48:51.74 --> 00:48:55.38
Do you go back down to a low point at some point?

623
00:48:55.38 --> 00:48:56.38
Yeah.

624
00:48:56.38 --> 00:48:57.38
Yeah.

625
00:48:57.38 --> 00:49:00.78
I mean, I mean, I think, like if, yeah.

626
00:49:00.78 --> 00:49:05.10
I mean, it's, it's always like a, it's like a roller coaster.

627
00:49:05.10 --> 00:49:07.10
I mean, I don't know what it calls it.

628
00:49:07.10 --> 00:49:10.02
The end I mean, like there's some days I wake up and I'm just like, me out, I don't even

629
00:49:10.02 --> 00:49:11.02
get out of bed.

630
00:49:11.02 --> 00:49:13.42
I don't even get out of bed.

631
00:49:13.42 --> 00:49:15.42
And why I don't know.

632
00:49:15.42 --> 00:49:19.30
But yeah, I mean, after I got the metal, I was in the lowest of the lows.

633
00:49:19.30 --> 00:49:21.22
I mean, it was the lowest of lows.

634
00:49:21.22 --> 00:49:26.06
I mean, it was just, I would literally, like, I'll never forget this one time, who was actually

635
00:49:26.06 --> 00:49:28.10
going to my speaking agency.

636
00:49:28.10 --> 00:49:32.90
Well, you, you talk about the day the, the president called me to come have a beer with

637
00:49:32.90 --> 00:49:33.90
him.

638
00:49:33.90 --> 00:49:39.14
Like, I was standing, I can remember, I was standing, speaking to some Marines.

639
00:49:39.14 --> 00:49:42.78
I won't say where, but I was speaking to some Marines at an event.

640
00:49:42.78 --> 00:49:44.42
And I, I was hammered.

641
00:49:44.42 --> 00:49:47.70
Like, it was probably 9, 10 a.m. in the morning.

642
00:49:47.70 --> 00:49:49.58
And I'm not talking about, like, buzzed.

643
00:49:49.58 --> 00:49:52.42
I'm talking about, like, Dakota was drunk.

644
00:49:52.42 --> 00:49:57.94
I would get up in the morning before interviews, like the six, five, six a.m. interviews.

645
00:49:57.94 --> 00:50:03.34
And I'd be taking shots on the way to the studio.

646
00:50:03.34 --> 00:50:07.06
And like, I was standing there and I'll never forget, like, whenever they said for me to

647
00:50:07.06 --> 00:50:10.06
come over and have a drink.

648
00:50:10.06 --> 00:50:13.30
So the, the girl who used to take care of me, her name is Janette.

649
00:50:13.30 --> 00:50:16.86
Janette looked at me in, like, her face, like, melted.

650
00:50:16.86 --> 00:50:20.26
She's like, I hope they don't give you sobriety tests before you go in.

651
00:50:20.26 --> 00:50:21.58
Like, we have to sober you up.

652
00:50:21.58 --> 00:50:26.74
She literally started making me pound waters to try to get me sober enough to go into the

653
00:50:26.74 --> 00:50:28.06
White House.

654
00:50:28.06 --> 00:50:29.78
And I mean, that was how I lived.

655
00:50:29.78 --> 00:50:33.94
Like, I just, I couldn't, I could, I hated, I couldn't take it, you know, and I mean,

656
00:50:33.94 --> 00:50:36.78
I could, but I just, I just hated what it was about.

657
00:50:36.78 --> 00:50:39.34
It wasn't about the work or about the workload.

658
00:50:39.34 --> 00:50:43.50
It was just I was literally just living this nightmare.

659
00:50:43.50 --> 00:50:46.90
And, you know, there were rock stars.

660
00:50:46.90 --> 00:50:50.62
And, but yeah, I mean, how was this shit, Joe?

661
00:50:50.62 --> 00:50:55.30
So how long did you stay in that mode for?

662
00:50:55.30 --> 00:50:57.90
Probably until, like, 2014?

663
00:50:57.90 --> 00:50:59.66
And then what happened in 2014?

664
00:50:59.66 --> 00:51:02.30
Did you realize something, what happened?

665
00:51:02.30 --> 00:51:08.10
I just, I state, like, I kind of, I kind of seen that, like, I need to get my shit together.

666
00:51:08.10 --> 00:51:16.70
You know, I was going out and I kind of had a turn of, like, I, look, I wasn't going to be

667
00:51:16.70 --> 00:51:17.70
able to change it.

668
00:51:17.70 --> 00:51:20.54
Like, I wasn't going to be able, I realized I wasn't going to be able to out drink it.

669
00:51:20.54 --> 00:51:23.22
And, um, how do I turn into something positive, right?

670
00:51:23.22 --> 00:51:27.98
And I, I just, I had this dream to be able to, to my ass, me one time, they're like,

671
00:51:27.98 --> 00:51:28.98
what do you want to do?

672
00:51:28.98 --> 00:51:32.62
And I'm like, I honestly, I just want to change the world.

673
00:51:32.62 --> 00:51:34.10
And I know it sounds crazy, right?

674
00:51:34.10 --> 00:51:35.46
It sounds so crazy.

675
00:51:35.46 --> 00:51:42.86
But when I, when I looked real deep into, why have I done, like, the stuff I didn't

676
00:51:42.86 --> 00:51:45.10
have can withstand?

677
00:51:45.10 --> 00:51:49.70
You know, like, I didn't do it for me.

678
00:51:49.70 --> 00:51:51.42
I didn't do it.

679
00:51:51.42 --> 00:51:56.34
The thing I did was ultimately down, of trying to make the world that I was part of,

680
00:51:56.34 --> 00:51:58.54
just a little bit better.

681
00:51:58.54 --> 00:52:04.10
Like, like, like, anytime I handed out soccer balls to the kids, or I went out front

682
00:52:04.10 --> 00:52:08.74
of the gate, you know, I was just trying to make their day a little bit better.

683
00:52:08.74 --> 00:52:10.22
Show them a different perspective.

684
00:52:10.22 --> 00:52:14.02
When I was, when I was taking a shot, now I was trying to take a guy out, or I was

685
00:52:14.02 --> 00:52:16.02
going in and they were asking for help.

686
00:52:16.02 --> 00:52:20.22
And hey, we need security in this, in this village to help us out the Taliban's doing this,

687
00:52:20.22 --> 00:52:24.70
so that I literally just wanted to make the world just a little bit better.

688
00:52:24.70 --> 00:52:31.26
And if, if that's truly my core purpose, why can do that here?

689
00:52:31.26 --> 00:52:32.54
It's no different.

690
00:52:32.54 --> 00:52:37.18
Well, one of the things that I've been talking about in a bunch of different ways lately

691
00:52:37.18 --> 00:52:41.94
is this idea of being caught in, like, an echo chamber and a feedback loop, and you hear

692
00:52:41.94 --> 00:52:47.90
it in the social media world because if you're a super liberal person, you just see a bunch

693
00:52:47.90 --> 00:52:54.90
of conservatives stuff, happens in a leadership position because if you're in a leadership position,

694
00:52:54.90 --> 00:53:00.66
and you have an idea and everyone just is a yes man, then says, yep, yep, yeah, you're

695
00:53:00.66 --> 00:53:01.66
great boss.

696
00:53:01.66 --> 00:53:04.90
That sounds like a great idea and you go forward, you're only hearing, you don't get any

697
00:53:04.90 --> 00:53:07.34
other input.

698
00:53:07.34 --> 00:53:13.50
And it happens to people's mentalities too, where, you know, they have a bad day, and then

699
00:53:13.50 --> 00:53:16.90
they think, well, today was so bad and tonight's going to be bad too, and then tomorrow

700
00:53:16.90 --> 00:53:24.26
was going to be bad, and I don't, they get caught in this echo chamber of reinforcing the

701
00:53:24.26 --> 00:53:27.62
same thoughts over and over again.

702
00:53:27.62 --> 00:53:31.50
And that's fine if they're good thoughts, but when it's a negative thought, and just like,

703
00:53:31.50 --> 00:53:34.02
you know, when you do feedback with a microphone into an amplifier, right?

704
00:53:34.02 --> 00:53:38.54
It just turns into a freaking squeal and you can't get out of it until you either shut

705
00:53:38.54 --> 00:53:41.70
that thing off or you get that microphone away.

706
00:53:41.70 --> 00:53:48.70
So, you know, it sounds like you were in that mode, but then you thought to yourself,

707
00:53:48.70 --> 00:53:54.54
you know, it's pretty, what you've just said of like realizing, hey, I can't change it,

708
00:53:54.54 --> 00:53:57.62
why did I do it, what can I do to move forward?

709
00:53:57.62 --> 00:54:06.30
Like that's a huge step away from, it's, it takes a lot of strength to break out of

710
00:54:06.30 --> 00:54:08.90
this negative attitude.

711
00:54:08.90 --> 00:54:14.50
And what sucks is you meet people and they're freaking trapped in there.

712
00:54:14.50 --> 00:54:22.90
And it's, it's, I don't know, I don't know if you can actually manually, I don't know

713
00:54:22.90 --> 00:54:26.66
if I can manually go to you and say, hey, you're in an echo chamber right now and get

714
00:54:26.66 --> 00:54:27.82
you out of it.

715
00:54:27.82 --> 00:54:28.82
Yeah.

716
00:54:28.82 --> 00:54:33.82
I think sometimes I think it may be that the person has to do that for themselves.

717
00:54:33.82 --> 00:54:42.58
Well, I always say like you, you can either like sometimes you find yourself in the middle

718
00:54:42.58 --> 00:54:48.34
of nowhere and the middle of nowhere and sometimes in the middle of nowhere you find yourself.

719
00:54:48.34 --> 00:54:55.98
And yeah, I mean, I think what's even more dangerous is when you start drinking your own

720
00:54:55.98 --> 00:54:58.06
coolly, right?

721
00:54:58.06 --> 00:55:03.78
Like when you're not looking at everybody else and kind of getting a feeling off of

722
00:55:03.78 --> 00:55:07.82
it and then you surround yourself with a bunch of yes people like and then you, and then

723
00:55:07.82 --> 00:55:10.78
you only get that you start drinking your own cool light.

724
00:55:10.78 --> 00:55:11.90
I mean, what happens?

725
00:55:11.90 --> 00:55:16.82
Like, yeah, you can live off of in a survival situation drinking your own urine.

726
00:55:16.82 --> 00:55:19.50
But what happens if you drink it five times over?

727
00:55:19.50 --> 00:55:21.06
It's dead, your dead.

728
00:55:21.06 --> 00:55:23.38
And I think that's dangerous.

729
00:55:23.38 --> 00:55:25.22
Well, actually, it's the same mechanism.

730
00:55:25.22 --> 00:55:28.98
It's just a different, it's just a one positive, one negative.

731
00:55:28.98 --> 00:55:31.98
If you go and just positive positive positive positive, you'll spend out and you'll think

732
00:55:31.98 --> 00:55:34.46
you can't be stopped and you can think you can do nothing wrong.

733
00:55:34.46 --> 00:55:36.54
If it's negative, negative, negative, you don't think you can do anything right.

734
00:55:36.54 --> 00:55:38.54
And the reality is for everybody.

735
00:55:38.54 --> 00:55:39.66
When you're some right, we do some wrong.

736
00:55:39.66 --> 00:55:40.66
We make some mistakes.

737
00:55:40.66 --> 00:55:41.66
We have some wins.

738
00:55:41.66 --> 00:55:42.94
We have some losses.

739
00:55:42.94 --> 00:55:43.94
We move forward.

740
00:55:43.94 --> 00:55:44.66
We take a couple steps back.

741
00:55:44.66 --> 00:55:45.94
We move forward again.

742
00:55:45.94 --> 00:55:50.18
But people that think, oh, every step I take is going to move me forward and everyone's, you

743
00:55:50.18 --> 00:55:56.34
know, everyone's following me because I'm awesome or nothing I can do can move me forward.

744
00:55:56.34 --> 00:55:57.74
It's not, that's not the way life is.

745
00:55:57.74 --> 00:55:58.94
It's not one or the other.

746
00:55:58.94 --> 00:56:01.22
It's both.

747
00:56:01.22 --> 00:56:05.14
And people get stuck there in one or the other.

748
00:56:05.14 --> 00:56:10.66
I think the negative one is the one that looked a positive one.

749
00:56:10.66 --> 00:56:16.22
It seems like what happens with the positive one is when you fall off that train, you

750
00:56:16.22 --> 00:56:20.66
at least you fall onto, you have a little distance to fall and you're going to be okay.

751
00:56:20.66 --> 00:56:23.14
You have like enough room to pull your reserve.

752
00:56:23.14 --> 00:56:28.58
When you're at the bottom, you're on reserve and you burn in.

753
00:56:28.58 --> 00:56:29.70
And that's what I was on, right?

754
00:56:29.70 --> 00:56:31.94
It was just everything was negative around me.

755
00:56:31.94 --> 00:56:34.46
The alcohol, I mean, everything was negative, right?

756
00:56:34.46 --> 00:56:37.94
I mean, I'm waking up literally talking about my teammates death.

757
00:56:37.94 --> 00:56:40.74
And everything was negative.

758
00:56:40.74 --> 00:56:48.98
I mean, it was, and I, I just had to pull myself out of it.

759
00:56:48.98 --> 00:56:55.18
I don't know of one situation that just like boom, smacked me out of it.

760
00:56:55.18 --> 00:56:59.90
I will say this like ultimately the, one of the biggest changing points in my life was

761
00:56:59.90 --> 00:57:04.74
when I had my daughter.

762
00:57:04.74 --> 00:57:08.62
That was, that was whenever the drinking quit.

763
00:57:08.62 --> 00:57:10.46
Like that was whenever I took it.

764
00:57:10.46 --> 00:57:18.18
And I said, I said, you know what, it's not about me.

765
00:57:18.18 --> 00:57:21.18
I know I'm not the best person in the world.

766
00:57:21.18 --> 00:57:27.18
And you know, I, but I'll tell you this, my daughter didn't choose to come in this world.

767
00:57:27.18 --> 00:57:28.18
She didn't choose to come in.

768
00:57:28.18 --> 00:57:32.66
The circumstances that she came in under.

769
00:57:32.66 --> 00:57:38.30
And it is my obligation to ultimately give her and wake up every day and strive to be

770
00:57:38.30 --> 00:57:41.18
the father that that young girl deserves.

771
00:57:41.18 --> 00:57:43.18
And that's it.

772
00:57:43.18 --> 00:57:45.18
It really is that simple.

773
00:57:45.18 --> 00:57:50.18
And so that was whenever the drinking just went to a halt.

774
00:57:50.18 --> 00:57:55.46
But then there was a whole suit problems after that right of now I'm not dealing with my

775
00:57:55.46 --> 00:58:00.02
anxiety or my issues with drinking now they're coming to light.

776
00:58:00.02 --> 00:58:05.02
So you know now it was kind of having to face the true reality of this not not not taking

777
00:58:05.02 --> 00:58:06.02
the band aid.

778
00:58:06.02 --> 00:58:08.22
I mean drinking is no different than taking.

779
00:58:08.22 --> 00:58:13.46
It feels, I mean, it's just a, it's just another, it's just another form of it right.

780
00:58:13.46 --> 00:58:17.14
And so that was a whole other problem.

781
00:58:17.14 --> 00:58:25.58
But I got to look at that little girl and like that was that is, you know, sailor and

782
00:58:25.58 --> 00:58:28.90
athlete are by far.

783
00:58:28.90 --> 00:58:31.58
I need them way more than they could ever need me.

784
00:58:31.58 --> 00:58:33.58
You know what I mean?

785
00:58:33.58 --> 00:58:39.90
Like, and they change my life for the better and they still do every day.

786
00:58:39.90 --> 00:58:47.38
Because ultimately that's what the man that I am, I have to be a good man because I want

787
00:58:47.38 --> 00:58:51.50
my daughters to find good man and I want them to know what a good man looks like.

788
00:58:51.50 --> 00:58:56.74
And I want if they start dating shitty guy someday it's probably because I'm a shitty guy.

789
00:58:56.74 --> 00:59:02.10
I want to set the example to them of hopefully what they strive to go to go find and

790
00:59:02.10 --> 00:59:04.78
marry someday.

791
00:59:04.78 --> 00:59:09.66
And I have to wake up and be that.

792
00:59:09.66 --> 00:59:13.18
That's weird from being in the military.

793
00:59:13.18 --> 00:59:17.98
The perspective for me because I was a young, unlisted guy.

794
00:59:17.98 --> 00:59:19.22
I was going to say young dumb.

795
00:59:19.22 --> 00:59:22.30
And yes, I was a young dumb and that's the guy.

796
00:59:22.30 --> 00:59:28.90
And the more I moved up in the ranks all of a sudden you're like responsible for people.

797
00:59:28.90 --> 00:59:32.54
And those was no overnight like transition for me.

798
00:59:32.54 --> 00:59:36.66
Because I was enlisted and then I became an officer and I was a junior officer.

799
00:59:36.66 --> 00:59:42.66
But it wasn't like I was an officer now and now I need to or I'm in charge of this training

800
00:59:42.66 --> 00:59:43.66
event.

801
00:59:43.66 --> 00:59:46.34
And so I need to know it wasn't like an overnight thing.

802
00:59:46.34 --> 00:59:52.58
But I realized that hey, all of these guys are counting on me to do my job to make good

803
00:59:52.58 --> 00:59:55.46
decisions to give them the support that they need.

804
00:59:55.46 --> 00:59:56.46
That's all on me.

805
00:59:56.46 --> 00:59:57.74
All on me 100%.

806
00:59:57.74 --> 01:00:03.78
And so slowly over time, I started acting more and more like a freaking responsible human

807
01:00:03.78 --> 01:00:11.14
instead of like a complete freaking savage when I was freaking younger to you guys.

808
01:00:11.14 --> 01:00:14.22
So I just got, you know, I just grew.

809
01:00:14.22 --> 01:00:19.18
And then obviously, yeah, when I had kids, it's like, oh, now there's people that also

810
01:00:19.18 --> 01:00:23.46
rely on me 100%.

811
01:00:23.46 --> 01:00:24.46
For everything.

812
01:00:24.46 --> 01:00:25.46
For everything.

813
01:00:25.46 --> 01:00:30.46
And they're looking at me as an example of how they should be acting and what they should

814
01:00:30.46 --> 01:00:31.46
be looking for.

815
01:00:31.46 --> 01:00:32.46
Yeah.

816
01:00:32.46 --> 01:00:33.46
Yeah.

817
01:00:33.46 --> 01:00:38.70
So you did you stop drinking like, yeah, I mean, cold turkey?

818
01:00:38.70 --> 01:00:40.70
I did.

819
01:00:40.70 --> 01:00:47.38
When sailor, when sailor was born, I pretty much, I mean, I pretty much cut it out to

820
01:00:47.38 --> 01:00:49.38
cold turkey.

821
01:00:49.38 --> 01:00:57.72
Yeah, I mean, I, I mean, I was like, yeah, I mean, I was, I had to, I mean, I was, I was in a

822
01:00:57.72 --> 01:00:59.02
custody battle first off.

823
01:00:59.02 --> 01:01:00.02
So how do the gate?

824
01:01:00.02 --> 01:01:03.42
I mean, I wasn't even, I mean, I wasn't, yeah, I mean, yeah, I wasn't

825
01:01:03.42 --> 01:01:05.26
in there when sailor was born.

826
01:01:05.26 --> 01:01:08.22
And I got to meet her like three months later.

827
01:01:08.22 --> 01:01:15.34
And so, you know, with the custody battle, it was, look, I'll take 90% of it, my fault.

828
01:01:15.34 --> 01:01:17.82
Mambras didn't get along.

829
01:01:17.82 --> 01:01:19.94
She went back to Alaska.

830
01:01:19.94 --> 01:01:21.10
It didn't work out, right?

831
01:01:21.10 --> 01:01:25.86
And so I wasn't there for the, the, the birth.

832
01:01:25.86 --> 01:01:33.38
And so finally, after three months of fighting and all the stuff that people do,

833
01:01:33.38 --> 01:01:37.54
right, and I look, I'm sure I call as my amount of it.

834
01:01:37.54 --> 01:01:42.18
So let me say that upfront, I'm definitely not an easy person to live with.

835
01:01:42.18 --> 01:01:46.74
You know, I finally got to meet her.

836
01:01:46.74 --> 01:01:52.10
And my out-kniver forget like I flew up, I flew up on an airplane.

837
01:01:52.10 --> 01:01:55.70
So first off after I seen, realized that sailor was born, I went.

838
01:01:55.70 --> 01:01:59.62
It was on the, it was on the 23rd, or she was born on the 23rd.

839
01:01:59.62 --> 01:02:04.74
And so Christmas that year was 20, Christmas Eve was on a Thursday.

840
01:02:04.74 --> 01:02:07.18
And Christmas is on Friday that year.

841
01:02:07.18 --> 01:02:11.50
And I went up that Saturday as soon as the store's open back up.

842
01:02:11.50 --> 01:02:14.50
And I, I went ahead and bought like all of her stuff to have my house.

843
01:02:14.50 --> 01:02:17.38
I didn't know when I'd get to see her or anything like that.

844
01:02:17.38 --> 01:02:19.02
If she'd ever even get to come, they can tuck you.

845
01:02:19.02 --> 01:02:20.58
But like, I was at that.

846
01:02:20.58 --> 01:02:22.06
So I was going to be a dad.

847
01:02:22.06 --> 01:02:25.54
And I had no clue about a change of diaper anything.

848
01:02:25.54 --> 01:02:30.98
And then I went to this month long, it's like an online nanny school.

849
01:02:30.98 --> 01:02:34.14
And I became a certified nanny and different care specialists.

850
01:02:34.14 --> 01:02:37.26
So I was like doing these classes.

851
01:02:37.26 --> 01:02:38.78
I was doing these classes, right?

852
01:02:38.78 --> 01:02:45.26
Like of how to swaddle, like learning about all these things that kids do, right?

853
01:02:45.26 --> 01:02:47.62
And I mean, I just never wanted to.

854
01:02:47.62 --> 01:02:48.98
It wasn't my daughter's fault.

855
01:02:48.98 --> 01:02:54.66
So like I never wanted to not be what she needed if she needed it.

856
01:02:54.66 --> 01:03:00.42
And so like I need to spend my mind set was I need to, you know, I'm a dad.

857
01:03:00.42 --> 01:03:05.30
And I need to try to, if I, even if I'm not with her, I need to be training to do something

858
01:03:05.30 --> 01:03:09.14
to be able to, to give her the life that she deserves.

859
01:03:09.14 --> 01:03:11.98
And man, three months into it, I got to major.

860
01:03:11.98 --> 01:03:13.98
And so I fly up there.

861
01:03:13.98 --> 01:03:16.58
And what I would do is I would fly to Alaska and we're like, I'm going to put this

862
01:03:16.58 --> 01:03:17.58
training to the kids.

863
01:03:17.58 --> 01:03:23.46
Yeah, it says like I had all this stuff like man, like I knew like the five essays of like,

864
01:03:23.46 --> 01:03:27.50
you know, how to get a child to like, you know, to calm down, like all this stuff.

865
01:03:27.50 --> 01:03:28.50
I was a master.

866
01:03:28.50 --> 01:03:32.02
I had this like little baby doll that I used to swaddle practicing, right?

867
01:03:32.02 --> 01:03:33.26
Yeah, crazy.

868
01:03:33.26 --> 01:03:34.26
I know.

869
01:03:34.26 --> 01:03:35.26
I know.

870
01:03:35.26 --> 01:03:40.06
So I fly up there.

871
01:03:40.06 --> 01:03:43.86
And so I would fly to Alaska every other weekend.

872
01:03:43.86 --> 01:03:49.38
And I would raise her for four days out of a hotel room, a three month old.

873
01:03:49.38 --> 01:03:51.46
And from Kentucky.

874
01:03:51.46 --> 01:03:54.30
And so I would go up there and I got her man.

875
01:03:54.30 --> 01:03:57.94
The first time I laid eyes on her, that was it.

876
01:03:57.94 --> 01:04:01.02
Like I got on the plane coming home after those four days.

877
01:04:01.02 --> 01:04:03.58
And I just say, hey, I'm getting rid of everything and Kentucky.

878
01:04:03.58 --> 01:04:06.90
And even if I just have to work at McDonalds, I'm going to Alaska and I'm going to raise

879
01:04:06.90 --> 01:04:09.78
this kid.

880
01:04:09.78 --> 01:04:10.78
I don't want anything else.

881
01:04:10.78 --> 01:04:11.78
I don't want another life.

882
01:04:11.78 --> 01:04:12.78
I don't want anything else.

883
01:04:12.78 --> 01:04:16.46
I don't care if I just, if I just have to live in a car park on a side road, I'm going

884
01:04:16.46 --> 01:04:17.46
to raise this kid.

885
01:04:17.46 --> 01:04:21.42
And I am going to, I'm going to be the best dad that I can be.

886
01:04:21.42 --> 01:04:24.50
And that's why I started figuring out right.

887
01:04:24.50 --> 01:04:28.34
I went home and literally started looking at assets about how to close everything down and

888
01:04:28.34 --> 01:04:29.34
leave.

889
01:04:29.34 --> 01:04:31.34
And yeah.

890
01:04:31.34 --> 01:04:33.46
So that was kind of, that's kind of that.

891
01:04:33.46 --> 01:04:34.78
And I just go up there.

892
01:04:34.78 --> 01:04:37.62
And then after that, you know, like a little ways into it, we stopped fighting.

893
01:04:37.62 --> 01:04:40.10
And remember, it's still decided to get married.

894
01:04:40.10 --> 01:04:47.34
And we got married and you know, had another kid and then went to shit.

895
01:04:47.34 --> 01:04:51.26
And all this stuff, you were,

896
01:04:51.26 --> 01:04:53.86
this is like tabloid material.

897
01:04:53.86 --> 01:04:56.86
Yeah, all tabloid material too.

898
01:04:56.86 --> 01:04:57.86
Yeah.

899
01:04:57.86 --> 01:04:58.86
So you, yeah.

900
01:04:58.86 --> 01:05:03.34
Like if you look at the tabloids now, like they don't refer to me as a metal of honor

901
01:05:03.34 --> 01:05:10.58
recipient, they refer to me as Bristol Palin's X.

902
01:05:10.58 --> 01:05:16.14
So you guys get married, which, you know, you're doing the best you can, you know,

903
01:05:16.14 --> 01:05:19.02
people do what they're going to do, you're trying to figure things out.

904
01:05:19.02 --> 01:05:21.22
Yeah, I mean, we tried looking.

905
01:05:21.22 --> 01:05:22.70
Bristol's not a bad person.

906
01:05:22.70 --> 01:05:25.62
You know, she's, she's the mother of my children.

907
01:05:25.62 --> 01:05:27.94
She gave me the most beautiful things in the world.

908
01:05:27.94 --> 01:05:29.02
Like my kids are healthy.

909
01:05:29.02 --> 01:05:30.18
They're beautiful.

910
01:05:30.18 --> 01:05:35.06
They are, they're the best thing that I have.

911
01:05:35.06 --> 01:05:36.22
And I owe her for that.

912
01:05:36.22 --> 01:05:38.38
I owe her for for all that.

913
01:05:38.38 --> 01:05:41.30
You know, I'm not an easy person to live with.

914
01:05:41.30 --> 01:05:45.34
Like let me tell you, I'm not.

915
01:05:45.34 --> 01:05:47.14
So yeah, so we got, we got our beautiful kids.

916
01:05:47.14 --> 01:05:47.98
So where did you move?

917
01:05:47.98 --> 01:05:50.30
Once you got, once you guys got married.

918
01:05:50.30 --> 01:05:56.26
So I, we, we got married and I literally packed up two suitcases and left

919
01:05:56.26 --> 01:05:58.30
for Alaska and I never came home.

920
01:05:58.30 --> 01:06:00.14
I just moved in with her.

921
01:06:00.14 --> 01:06:05.58
And I would fly to the States, just as I was on, going to give speeches across

922
01:06:05.58 --> 01:06:11.18
them, you know, Canada, lived up there for a year and then we moved to Austin.

923
01:06:11.18 --> 01:06:17.74
And how you doing, like at that point, are you starting to sort of process

924
01:06:17.74 --> 01:06:22.30
everything that happened or you starting to be like, okay, these people are calling

925
01:06:22.30 --> 01:06:26.98
me a hero, but I have an opportunity to be able to explain to them my perspective of it.

926
01:06:26.98 --> 01:06:31.18
When you start to kind of put this together in a way that was more manageable for you.

927
01:06:31.18 --> 01:06:33.82
No, I mean, it's still not, right?

928
01:06:33.82 --> 01:06:35.98
Because everybody wants to argue with me.

929
01:06:35.98 --> 01:06:39.02
You know, it's like, no, no, like understand I'm a failure.

930
01:06:39.02 --> 01:06:42.26
Oh, no, you did everything.

931
01:06:42.26 --> 01:06:45.10
You could, like shut up.

932
01:06:45.10 --> 01:06:46.10
You know what I mean?

933
01:06:46.10 --> 01:06:47.86
No, it's still that way.

934
01:06:47.86 --> 01:06:52.98
You know, it's just, no, it's still not.

935
01:06:52.98 --> 01:06:54.82
It's still not back.

936
01:06:54.82 --> 01:07:00.66
You know, people still, they hold me in this regard that I'm like, that I'm something, that

937
01:07:00.66 --> 01:07:04.46
I'm something that I'm not, I'm no different than anybody else.

938
01:07:04.46 --> 01:07:11.98
You know, as I said to something, you said you, I was listening to your podcast actually.

939
01:07:11.98 --> 01:07:16.02
When you were saying something along lines of, hey, you know, I, I received the metal of

940
01:07:16.02 --> 01:07:19.30
honor, but I don't want to let that define me.

941
01:07:19.30 --> 01:07:21.54
I don't want that to be like the thing that I'm known for.

942
01:07:21.54 --> 01:07:27.42
And I started thinking to myself, you and me know how freaking completely random war is.

943
01:07:27.42 --> 01:07:30.22
Like, you don't know what the hell is going to happen.

944
01:07:30.22 --> 01:07:32.26
There's nothing to wait to predict anything.

945
01:07:32.26 --> 01:07:34.06
You could have done that deployment.

946
01:07:34.06 --> 01:07:37.30
That mission could have got scrubbed for 10,000 reasons at night.

947
01:07:37.30 --> 01:07:40.18
It could have gone in the Taliban could have not been there.

948
01:07:40.18 --> 01:07:41.18
There's like a million things.

949
01:07:41.18 --> 01:07:47.22
And so really there's a role of the dice that you were in this situation, the way it

950
01:07:47.22 --> 01:07:49.34
went down, you didn't get killed.

951
01:07:49.34 --> 01:07:55.78
You know, it's just, it's so random that if you did hang your hat on that one thing, it's

952
01:07:55.78 --> 01:08:00.42
like, that's like saying, hey, that's like, that's like, I won the loto.

953
01:08:00.42 --> 01:08:01.42
Yeah.

954
01:08:01.42 --> 01:08:04.22
So you should, you know, that means I'm smart or whatever.

955
01:08:04.22 --> 01:08:07.86
Like, you know, it's, you can't let me pick your numbers for all your body.

956
01:08:07.86 --> 01:08:08.86
Yeah.

957
01:08:08.86 --> 01:08:11.70
Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking about that.

958
01:08:11.70 --> 01:08:16.22
Like, you can't let it define you because if you do let it define you, then you're defining

959
01:08:16.22 --> 01:08:20.66
yourself on the fact, it's like, it's like defining yourself on, you know, how tall you are.

960
01:08:20.66 --> 01:08:21.66
Yeah.

961
01:08:21.66 --> 01:08:23.42
It's like, hey, you know, that's just how tall you are.

962
01:08:23.42 --> 01:08:24.58
There's nothing you could do about that.

963
01:08:24.58 --> 01:08:30.10
Now look, obviously you took actions that were conscious decision to go doing what you

964
01:08:30.10 --> 01:08:31.58
had to do.

965
01:08:31.58 --> 01:08:37.34
But you're right in the fact that if you let that one thing define you, you're hanging

966
01:08:37.34 --> 01:08:39.74
your hat on something that's kind of random.

967
01:08:39.74 --> 01:08:41.38
Well, exactly, right?

968
01:08:41.38 --> 01:08:49.82
But it's also, I mean, it's also like, like, what if, what if like a fighter gets in the ring

969
01:08:49.82 --> 01:08:51.46
and he gets a win?

970
01:08:51.46 --> 01:08:56.62
I mean, whether like he got a knockout and it was one hit and it was a whiz.

971
01:08:56.62 --> 01:08:58.30
I mean, are those hits lucky, right?

972
01:08:58.30 --> 01:09:03.18
I mean, you know, I mean, like, could you, can you really walk into a ring and say you're

973
01:09:03.18 --> 01:09:05.18
going to like, and knock people?

974
01:09:05.18 --> 01:09:06.18
You know what I mean?

975
01:09:06.18 --> 01:09:08.54
Like, some of that is the same, right?

976
01:09:08.54 --> 01:09:13.46
Some of it is this guy, just, if you've, if you didn't break this or you know what I mean?

977
01:09:13.46 --> 01:09:15.90
Like, that's why the games are played, right?

978
01:09:15.90 --> 01:09:18.54
It's why football teams are not fantasy.

979
01:09:18.54 --> 01:09:19.54
You know what I mean?

980
01:09:19.54 --> 01:09:21.50
Like, that's why the game is played.

981
01:09:21.50 --> 01:09:30.62
And so like for me, it was like, yeah, that day, that day out, like, if it comes down

982
01:09:30.62 --> 01:09:32.58
to fighting, like, I fought myself.

983
01:09:32.58 --> 01:09:36.62
I'll say that.

984
01:09:36.62 --> 01:09:40.34
I fought as hard as I could.

985
01:09:40.34 --> 01:09:43.06
But that was one day in my life.

986
01:09:43.06 --> 01:09:45.22
What about the rest of them?

987
01:09:45.22 --> 01:09:46.46
You know, like, that day's done.

988
01:09:46.46 --> 01:09:47.46
That's behind me.

989
01:09:47.46 --> 01:09:49.58
Well, what's next?

990
01:09:49.58 --> 01:09:50.58
Right?

991
01:09:50.58 --> 01:09:55.86
Like, I mean, I was in a gunfight four days later that I felt like was worse than that one.

992
01:09:55.86 --> 01:09:56.86
You know what I mean?

993
01:09:56.86 --> 01:10:04.62
Obviously I lost my teammates with sucked, but as far as like, I mean, the next one was

994
01:10:04.62 --> 01:10:07.78
was a harder one for me to pick out than the first one, right?

995
01:10:07.78 --> 01:10:09.02
And nobody knows about that.

996
01:10:09.02 --> 01:10:10.42
I mean, I still kept fighting.

997
01:10:10.42 --> 01:10:13.54
We've gotten a ton of fights after that.

998
01:10:13.54 --> 01:10:15.82
And so like, you just can't be defined by that.

999
01:10:15.82 --> 01:10:19.74
You know, your only is good as, as your next step bad.

1000
01:10:19.74 --> 01:10:24.50
And it's like you can't, you can't let your failures define you.

1001
01:10:24.50 --> 01:10:26.82
And you can't let your successes define you.

1002
01:10:26.82 --> 01:10:30.42
Both of them are nothing more than moments in time.

1003
01:10:30.42 --> 01:10:31.42
Yeah.

1004
01:10:31.42 --> 01:10:38.34
That's, that was kind of my, I don't want to call it a setup, but like, it's one thing.

1005
01:10:38.34 --> 01:10:39.34
That's right.

1006
01:10:39.34 --> 01:10:42.18
And even though you feel like, oh, I failed that night.

1007
01:10:42.18 --> 01:10:44.82
So yeah, that was one, that was one thing.

1008
01:10:44.82 --> 01:10:45.82
I did.

1009
01:10:45.82 --> 01:10:51.30
And so to say, you don't want to define yourself by receiving this one award.

1010
01:10:51.30 --> 01:10:56.78
It's also you can't define yourself by the fact that that day you didn't win.

1011
01:10:56.78 --> 01:11:01.86
Exactly, but it still doesn't change the results of the day, right?

1012
01:11:01.86 --> 01:11:08.06
Like, and at the end of the day, those of all taught me valuable lessons.

1013
01:11:08.06 --> 01:11:14.30
You know, you can't, like, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

1014
01:11:14.30 --> 01:11:20.54
hear me out on this, but like life is nothing more than like a, uh, and you're gonna laugh when

1015
01:11:20.54 --> 01:11:21.54
I've defined it.

1016
01:11:21.54 --> 01:11:22.54
When I say this.

1017
01:11:22.54 --> 01:11:24.54
Life is nothing more than for doing.

1018
01:11:24.54 --> 01:11:29.46
You know, like, you know, like an Halloween, they have those rough, good start.

1019
01:11:29.46 --> 01:11:31.14
Okay, scary houses, right?

1020
01:11:31.14 --> 01:11:34.26
Or those those those those whatever those houses that they talked about.

1021
01:11:34.26 --> 01:11:35.26
On the house.

1022
01:11:35.26 --> 01:11:36.26
On the house, right?

1023
01:11:36.26 --> 01:11:37.26
Calm scary houses.

1024
01:11:37.26 --> 01:11:38.26
Whatever.

1025
01:11:38.26 --> 01:11:42.14
So life is like, that's life.

1026
01:11:42.14 --> 01:11:46.18
After you've walked through that heart house once, does it get you again?

1027
01:11:46.18 --> 01:11:47.18
No.

1028
01:11:47.18 --> 01:11:48.98
So that's life, right?

1029
01:11:48.98 --> 01:11:55.10
Like life is full of these things that are not real that scare us because we've never seen

1030
01:11:55.10 --> 01:11:58.14
them or we've never seen them in that place or whatever, right?

1031
01:11:58.14 --> 01:12:01.14
We wouldn't expect them coming there.

1032
01:12:01.14 --> 01:12:04.42
So it kind of shakes us for a second.

1033
01:12:04.42 --> 01:12:06.98
But you got one or two options.

1034
01:12:06.98 --> 01:12:11.26
After you've seen it, you can either, okay, I got it.

1035
01:12:11.26 --> 01:12:12.26
You're there.

1036
01:12:12.26 --> 01:12:13.54
You got me on that one.

1037
01:12:13.54 --> 01:12:15.90
But if I walk through this house again, you don't have me, right?

1038
01:12:15.90 --> 01:12:18.90
And that in that life, like, that's life, right?

1039
01:12:18.90 --> 01:12:25.88
And you know, so like that day, I got the cool parties is like, that's my, that day's

1040
01:12:25.88 --> 01:12:26.88
my kryptonite.

1041
01:12:26.88 --> 01:12:33.22
I'm not going to say that I could never see anything worse because, obviously it could

1042
01:12:33.22 --> 01:12:34.54
always be worse.

1043
01:12:34.54 --> 01:12:43.42
But man, at 21, 21, I got to walk through one of the scariest damn houses that life could

1044
01:12:43.42 --> 01:12:45.62
throw at me.

1045
01:12:45.62 --> 01:12:48.86
I'm going to tell you right now, I got, I got to sit here and look death.

1046
01:12:48.86 --> 01:12:55.82
Right in the eyes, I never thought, I, I never thought I would make it out.

1047
01:12:55.82 --> 01:12:56.82
I got to look at that.

1048
01:12:56.82 --> 01:12:58.82
So I don't have to worry about every day's a bonus day for me.

1049
01:12:58.82 --> 01:13:02.46
I didn't think I was going to live past September 8, 2009.

1050
01:13:02.46 --> 01:13:06.42
I got to sit here and see the very best of human beings.

1051
01:13:06.42 --> 01:13:08.66
I got to see the very worst.

1052
01:13:08.66 --> 01:13:12.86
I got to see what I would do if somebody had a gun to my head.

1053
01:13:12.86 --> 01:13:16.58
I got all these things out of the way in one day that most people go through their whole

1054
01:13:16.58 --> 01:13:20.58
life wondering what they would do.

1055
01:13:20.58 --> 01:13:26.78
You know, I got to know that at 21, what do I have to worry about, going into the next

1056
01:13:26.78 --> 01:13:27.78
house?

1057
01:13:27.78 --> 01:13:29.78
You know what I mean?

1058
01:13:29.78 --> 01:13:32.94
I got my ass beat, all of it.

1059
01:13:32.94 --> 01:13:37.18
You're not going to beat my ass worse than that.

1060
01:13:37.18 --> 01:13:38.74
So I don't have to worry about it.

1061
01:13:38.74 --> 01:13:42.22
You know, the most dangerous guy in the room is the guy that doesn't care to lose.

1062
01:13:42.22 --> 01:13:44.90
I'm not going to tell you.

1063
01:13:44.90 --> 01:13:46.50
I don't care to lose.

1064
01:13:46.50 --> 01:13:50.30
You know, and that's my kryptonite.

1065
01:13:50.30 --> 01:13:52.74
That's like my power or whatever, right?

1066
01:13:52.74 --> 01:13:59.02
That's my, and I'm so fortunate to have gotten that out of the way at 21 years old because

1067
01:13:59.02 --> 01:14:02.50
it's allowed me to go live the life that I've lived, right?

1068
01:14:02.50 --> 01:14:05.82
I get to, I mean, I jump out of airplanes.

1069
01:14:05.82 --> 01:14:07.38
I fly airplanes.

1070
01:14:07.38 --> 01:14:09.54
I fly helicopters.

1071
01:14:09.54 --> 01:14:10.54
I do it.

1072
01:14:10.54 --> 01:14:14.54
And it's like, I get to do it because, and I get to go talk to people about what it's

1073
01:14:14.54 --> 01:14:15.54
like.

1074
01:14:15.54 --> 01:14:18.42
To go tell people, it's all good.

1075
01:14:18.42 --> 01:14:19.46
You can do this, right?

1076
01:14:19.46 --> 01:14:21.86
And so it's kind of a, it's good.

1077
01:14:21.86 --> 01:14:25.46
It's a good thing.

1078
01:14:25.46 --> 01:14:33.30
So where does like, I know a while ago, you know, you had like anxiety.

1079
01:14:33.30 --> 01:14:34.46
Yeah.

1080
01:14:34.46 --> 01:14:35.78
What even is that?

1081
01:14:35.78 --> 01:14:36.94
What does that feel like?

1082
01:14:36.94 --> 01:14:38.82
What happens?

1083
01:14:38.82 --> 01:14:39.82
Where does it come from?

1084
01:14:39.82 --> 01:14:41.74
What do you know about it?

1085
01:14:41.74 --> 01:14:48.06
So I didn't even know, I didn't even know what, I didn't even know a had anxiety.

1086
01:14:48.06 --> 01:14:52.10
I guess like you just kind of get used to feeling this way.

1087
01:14:52.10 --> 01:15:00.66
And I, he got so bad, like after I moved to Alaska when the drinking stopped.

1088
01:15:00.66 --> 01:15:04.94
That, like, I would, I would wake up throwing up.

1089
01:15:04.94 --> 01:15:09.06
I would grind my T-Sohar, like, my teeth on the back are caps.

1090
01:15:09.06 --> 01:15:12.50
And like, I would, I have been here, and I would knock my teeth off with been here.

1091
01:15:12.50 --> 01:15:15.86
Like I'd knock them off by grinding my teeth.

1092
01:15:15.86 --> 01:15:17.46
I'm out of wake up and I'd be throwing up.

1093
01:15:17.46 --> 01:15:21.22
I would be sweating in bed, crying my eyes out.

1094
01:15:21.22 --> 01:15:24.50
Like just can't sit down, can't, like I would try to run it off.

1095
01:15:24.50 --> 01:15:25.90
I can't run it off, can't lay down.

1096
01:15:25.90 --> 01:15:29.14
Like, it just, it was like, what's wrong with me?

1097
01:15:29.14 --> 01:15:30.14
You know what I mean?

1098
01:15:30.14 --> 01:15:31.14
What is wrong?

1099
01:15:31.14 --> 01:15:32.42
I don't even know what's going on.

1100
01:15:32.42 --> 01:15:39.18
And I find out this is this an anxiety attack.

1101
01:15:39.18 --> 01:15:45.26
And you know, I just, I started dealing with it.

1102
01:15:45.26 --> 01:15:51.30
I had a real bad anxiety attack, but I didn't want to go to the hospital because like,

1103
01:15:51.30 --> 01:15:57.46
the VA gave me the option of the VA gave me an option of, I call them up.

1104
01:15:57.46 --> 01:15:58.46
Okay.

1105
01:15:58.46 --> 01:16:02.10
I call them up and I'm like, hey, I need to, I kind of just need to see somebody.

1106
01:16:02.10 --> 01:16:05.06
And they're like, what do you have a case manager?

1107
01:16:05.06 --> 01:16:08.54
I said I don't, like, I live in Alaska, I don't.

1108
01:16:08.54 --> 01:16:10.14
And they're like, okay.

1109
01:16:10.14 --> 01:16:12.14
Now I'm a metal runner recipient.

1110
01:16:12.14 --> 01:16:19.14
I mean, I've got pretty high status in the VA, like as far as the statuses they have, right?

1111
01:16:19.14 --> 01:16:20.74
Like they have these old levels or whatever.

1112
01:16:20.74 --> 01:16:21.74
I imagine.

1113
01:16:21.74 --> 01:16:23.46
So I'm going to be pretty high up there, yeah.

1114
01:16:23.46 --> 01:16:27.50
So like I ask them, I'm like, I just need to see somebody like maybe to give me like

1115
01:16:27.50 --> 01:16:30.30
some blood pressure medicine or something to help me get this, just get through this.

1116
01:16:30.30 --> 01:16:31.30
I just need to get something to get through it.

1117
01:16:31.30 --> 01:16:37.14
I don't want any, like, I'm not asking for Zanxes or whatever, right?

1118
01:16:37.14 --> 01:16:40.74
And they go, well, if you don't have a case manager, then we'll have to get you one of those.

1119
01:16:40.74 --> 01:16:44.70
And then after you get and seen with the case managers, then what we'll do is that case manager

1120
01:16:44.70 --> 01:16:49.58
will get you a doctor and then after you meet with a doctor, then they'll get you to a psychiatrist

1121
01:16:49.58 --> 01:16:51.66
and then you'll be able to get some help for it.

1122
01:16:51.66 --> 01:16:54.42
I said, well, how long is that going to be?

1123
01:16:54.42 --> 01:16:57.66
Probably four to six weeks.

1124
01:16:57.66 --> 01:17:01.18
And I said, I don't have four to six weeks.

1125
01:17:01.18 --> 01:17:06.94
And the woman on the phone, she said, well, you can always come check your in yourself

1126
01:17:06.94 --> 01:17:11.26
into the psych ward.

1127
01:17:11.26 --> 01:17:15.86
And I was like, I don't need that.

1128
01:17:15.86 --> 01:17:17.18
There's no way.

1129
01:17:17.18 --> 01:17:19.82
These are my options.

1130
01:17:19.82 --> 01:17:25.14
And so I called, I called one of my buddies and he knew a doctor and the doctor was like,

1131
01:17:25.14 --> 01:17:29.46
they gave me like some blood pressure medicine that usually some people take for anxiety.

1132
01:17:29.46 --> 01:17:30.46
So I were taking it.

1133
01:17:30.46 --> 01:17:35.02
And then fortunately, they sent me this thing called the alpha stem.

1134
01:17:35.02 --> 01:17:37.86
And it clips on your ears.

1135
01:17:37.86 --> 01:17:40.74
And when they sent it to me, I wouldn't even open it.

1136
01:17:40.74 --> 01:17:46.42
I was so mad that somebody sent this to me because I was like, you really think, this

1137
01:17:46.42 --> 01:17:48.30
is what you think my level of anxiety is.

1138
01:17:48.30 --> 01:17:50.02
You think it's a joke?

1139
01:17:50.02 --> 01:17:57.02
I'm picture in the thing that the time travel machine that Kip puts on his head in the

1140
01:17:57.02 --> 01:17:59.38
Napoleon Dynamite, something like that.

1141
01:17:59.38 --> 01:18:04.10
So finally one day, I'm sitting there and I've got anxiety.

1142
01:18:04.10 --> 01:18:08.54
And it feels like your chest is just like something sitting on your chest.

1143
01:18:08.54 --> 01:18:10.74
Does it come from like, thoughts?

1144
01:18:10.74 --> 01:18:12.74
No, I don't know.

1145
01:18:12.74 --> 01:18:14.74
Is it a physical thing?

1146
01:18:14.74 --> 01:18:15.74
Is it a mental thing?

1147
01:18:15.74 --> 01:18:16.74
It's a physical.

1148
01:18:16.74 --> 01:18:17.74
It's a physical.

1149
01:18:17.74 --> 01:18:21.78
Like you'll feel like you're having a heart attack.

1150
01:18:21.78 --> 01:18:24.78
And you could be watching the freaking cartoons with your kids.

1151
01:18:24.78 --> 01:18:26.74
I'm happy to be just sitting in my truck.

1152
01:18:26.74 --> 01:18:29.30
Sitting in your truck, nothing, just playing.

1153
01:18:29.30 --> 01:18:30.74
And all of a sudden you feel this.

1154
01:18:30.74 --> 01:18:32.74
Yeah, I can feel it coming.

1155
01:18:32.74 --> 01:18:34.74
Is it the same as a panic attack?

1156
01:18:34.74 --> 01:18:36.14
Same thing.

1157
01:18:36.14 --> 01:18:39.74
But do you feel like you're worried about something consciously?

1158
01:18:39.74 --> 01:18:43.74
Or I think it lives in your subconscious?

1159
01:18:43.74 --> 01:18:45.74
You know, like, you can't know.

1160
01:18:45.74 --> 01:18:48.74
I mean, I would be fine.

1161
01:18:48.74 --> 01:18:50.74
And then like it just all of a sudden hits.

1162
01:18:50.74 --> 01:18:54.74
And it's like, it's like, oh gosh, like you can feel it coming.

1163
01:18:54.74 --> 01:18:56.74
And you just, how do I get rid of this?

1164
01:18:56.74 --> 01:18:58.74
And it's, I think it's a subconscious piece, right?

1165
01:18:58.74 --> 01:19:03.74
Like, that's why like it comes out mostly when I'm sleeping.

1166
01:19:03.74 --> 01:19:06.74
Because I can't consciously control what I'm thinking about.

1167
01:19:06.74 --> 01:19:12.74
And when I go to sleep, whatever in your brain needs to come out is coming out.

1168
01:19:12.74 --> 01:19:14.74
Are you dreaming?

1169
01:19:14.74 --> 01:19:16.74
Or you have a nightmare?

1170
01:19:16.74 --> 01:19:17.74
Yeah.

1171
01:19:17.74 --> 01:19:19.74
And the nightmare is like trigger this.

1172
01:19:19.74 --> 01:19:22.74
Usually.

1173
01:19:22.74 --> 01:19:28.74
When the cure for it, because you said the case advisor would send you to a doctor,

1174
01:19:28.74 --> 01:19:31.74
the doctor would send you to a psychiatrist.

1175
01:19:31.74 --> 01:19:35.74
So ultimately, is that what they're looking to do to you is give you some kind of

1176
01:19:35.74 --> 01:19:37.74
psychiatric medicine.

1177
01:19:37.74 --> 01:19:40.74
You know, X-axis, clotipin.

1178
01:19:40.74 --> 01:19:42.74
And these are things that like mellow you out.

1179
01:19:42.74 --> 01:19:44.74
Yeah, or something.

1180
01:19:44.74 --> 01:19:45.74
Allegedly.

1181
01:19:45.74 --> 01:19:47.74
And get you, get you addicted to them.

1182
01:19:47.74 --> 01:19:48.74
Yeah, that was on me.

1183
01:19:48.74 --> 01:19:50.74
Because they're going to numb the pain.

1184
01:19:50.74 --> 01:19:53.74
They're going to numb the thoughts that are causing this stuff.

1185
01:19:53.74 --> 01:19:54.74
Yeah.

1186
01:19:54.74 --> 01:19:58.74
And, yeah, I mean, it's like, you get on that.

1187
01:19:58.74 --> 01:19:59.74
It's a slope, right?

1188
01:19:59.74 --> 01:20:04.74
It's a slope of, you know, why have you started taking that?

1189
01:20:04.74 --> 01:20:06.74
Then, you know, you start getting depressed, right?

1190
01:20:06.74 --> 01:20:09.74
Because I mean, imagine, you know, that was always my problem.

1191
01:20:09.74 --> 01:20:11.74
Like, if I took clotipin or anything like that,

1192
01:20:11.74 --> 01:20:13.74
well, you have a hangover the next day.

1193
01:20:13.74 --> 01:20:15.74
And then I didn't feel like working out.

1194
01:20:15.74 --> 01:20:17.74
So then I don't feel like working out.

1195
01:20:17.74 --> 01:20:20.74
So then it's like, you just, it's like a, it's like this slope of just.

1196
01:20:20.74 --> 01:20:21.74
Right.

1197
01:20:21.74 --> 01:20:24.74
Then, you know, when you, when you get depressed and you start, you know,

1198
01:20:24.74 --> 01:20:25.74
you can't work out.

1199
01:20:25.74 --> 01:20:26.74
You don't feel your normal self.

1200
01:20:26.74 --> 01:20:28.74
Then you're like, why I'm broken.

1201
01:20:28.74 --> 01:20:32.74
And it's just like this downward slope of just.

1202
01:20:32.74 --> 01:20:36.74
It's like, hey, you know what, like, I don't, I'm not scared to look at it.

1203
01:20:36.74 --> 01:20:40.74
I'm not scared to look my demons in the eyes.

1204
01:20:40.74 --> 01:20:44.74
But like when it turns into something like mentally,

1205
01:20:44.74 --> 01:20:45.74
I can deal with it.

1206
01:20:45.74 --> 01:20:47.74
It's when it starts coming out physically.

1207
01:20:47.74 --> 01:20:50.74
Is it starts, is it starts getting you, right?

1208
01:20:50.74 --> 01:20:54.74
So, so back to the earlobe freaking machine.

1209
01:20:54.74 --> 01:20:55.74
So, so that's it.

1210
01:20:55.74 --> 01:20:57.74
So the alpha stem.

1211
01:20:57.74 --> 01:20:59.74
I finally put it on.

1212
01:20:59.74 --> 01:21:02.74
And it would like melted away.

1213
01:21:02.74 --> 01:21:05.74
It would like melted away.

1214
01:21:05.74 --> 01:21:08.74
So you start feeling it, go hook it up.

1215
01:21:08.74 --> 01:21:11.74
I'd hook it up 20 minutes at night before I went to bed.

1216
01:21:11.74 --> 01:21:13.74
That's sleep better.

1217
01:21:13.74 --> 01:21:14.74
Yeah, it was awesome.

1218
01:21:14.74 --> 01:21:18.74
And then, and then I met this person.

1219
01:21:18.74 --> 01:21:23.74
She worked with the guys out at Fort Bragg.

1220
01:21:23.74 --> 01:21:27.74
I met her one and she's like, hey, you need to try this.

1221
01:21:27.74 --> 01:21:30.74
It's called a Stella gangley in block.

1222
01:21:30.74 --> 01:21:31.74
Actually, a seal.

1223
01:21:31.74 --> 01:21:34.74
Sean Mulvaney, Dr. Mulvaney.

1224
01:21:34.74 --> 01:21:37.74
I'm like, come on.

1225
01:21:37.74 --> 01:21:40.74
Everybody's promised me the world with this stuff.

1226
01:21:40.74 --> 01:21:42.74
She's like, go to it.

1227
01:21:42.74 --> 01:21:44.74
SGB.

1228
01:21:44.74 --> 01:21:46.74
And so I fly out.

1229
01:21:46.74 --> 01:21:49.74
I was at rock bottom again.

1230
01:21:49.74 --> 01:21:52.74
Like, it was just frustrating that I can't operate.

1231
01:21:52.74 --> 01:21:56.74
How often are you having these anxiety attacks twice a week?

1232
01:21:56.74 --> 01:21:58.74
And they're freaking crippling.

1233
01:21:58.74 --> 01:22:00.74
I'm talking about throwing up in the floor.

1234
01:22:00.74 --> 01:22:03.74
Like, I'm talking about throwing up in the floor.

1235
01:22:03.74 --> 01:22:06.74
Like, I'm talking about how long are you last for?

1236
01:22:06.74 --> 01:22:09.74
Uh, an hour, 45 minutes.

1237
01:22:09.74 --> 01:22:11.74
And you know, I deal when they're going to hit.

1238
01:22:11.74 --> 01:22:12.74
No.

1239
01:22:12.74 --> 01:22:14.74
And there's no going back to sleep after them.

1240
01:22:14.74 --> 01:22:16.74
Right? Like, there's no.

1241
01:22:16.74 --> 01:22:17.74
Yeah.

1242
01:22:17.74 --> 01:22:20.74
And I'll never forget my daughter looked at me one time.

1243
01:22:20.74 --> 01:22:21.74
We were actually on the road.

1244
01:22:21.74 --> 01:22:23.74
Me and her traveling.

1245
01:22:23.74 --> 01:22:25.74
And so like, I would be scared.

1246
01:22:25.74 --> 01:22:30.74
Like, I never liked the kids to sleep in the bed with me because I never wanted my daughters to see me like that.

1247
01:22:30.74 --> 01:22:36.74
And there were there were a lot of nights that I was sleeping my car in the best by parking lot.

1248
01:22:36.74 --> 01:22:40.74
Probably about three years ago, four years ago, three years ago.

1249
01:22:40.74 --> 01:22:45.74
I was sleeping the best by parking lot because I didn't want anybody to see me see me like that.

1250
01:22:45.74 --> 01:22:47.74
If I felt like I was getting anxiety.

1251
01:22:47.74 --> 01:22:50.74
And you, you still married at this time?

1252
01:22:50.74 --> 01:22:51.74
Yeah.

1253
01:22:51.74 --> 01:22:56.74
And is there any like, how's that going?

1254
01:22:56.74 --> 01:22:57.74
Yeah.

1255
01:22:57.74 --> 01:23:00.74
Just like you guys are trying to figure it out. Yeah.

1256
01:23:00.74 --> 01:23:01.74
It's just what it is.

1257
01:23:01.74 --> 01:23:02.74
She can't. I mean, she doesn't.

1258
01:23:02.74 --> 01:23:07.74
You know, she's, we got three kids and, you know, she's watching me.

1259
01:23:07.74 --> 01:23:10.74
How could you be married to somebody like that?

1260
01:23:10.74 --> 01:23:13.74
How could you be married to somebody who, you know, you look at.

1261
01:23:13.74 --> 01:23:16.74
And like, you don't understand their anxiety.

1262
01:23:16.74 --> 01:23:18.74
So like, you're kind of like, what's wrong with this person?

1263
01:23:18.74 --> 01:23:20.74
You know what I mean? Like, this guy's just this week.

1264
01:23:20.74 --> 01:23:22.74
You know what I mean? It's like, it's not something.

1265
01:23:22.74 --> 01:23:24.74
It's hard to understand, you know?

1266
01:23:24.74 --> 01:23:28.74
And I never forget like me and say they were traveling.

1267
01:23:28.74 --> 01:23:30.74
We were actually at a Marine base.

1268
01:23:30.74 --> 01:23:32.74
And I'd been speaking to a bunch of Marines.

1269
01:23:32.74 --> 01:23:34.74
And she was with me.

1270
01:23:34.74 --> 01:23:38.74
And she was having to sleep in the bed with me at, you know, on the road.

1271
01:23:38.74 --> 01:23:44.74
And I woke up and I was, I was throwing up and I was sitting on a side of bed crying.

1272
01:23:44.74 --> 01:23:49.74
And like, I, I knocked two of my teeth off my, and they came off.

1273
01:23:49.74 --> 01:23:53.74
And like, she, I honestly forgot she was in the bed.

1274
01:23:53.74 --> 01:23:58.74
And, um, man, she got up and like, she like,

1275
01:23:58.74 --> 01:24:03.74
She like, patting me on the back and she said, uh,

1276
01:24:03.74 --> 01:24:07.74
It's okay, daddy. Like, I know you're a good daddy.

1277
01:24:07.74 --> 01:24:13.74
And, uh, man, it was, that was, that was a tough one, right?

1278
01:24:13.74 --> 01:24:18.74
You know, like, it was just, uh, and so I, um,

1279
01:24:18.74 --> 01:24:21.74
Then I was like, I got to do something different.

1280
01:24:21.74 --> 01:24:24.74
You know, like, I was getting the still like angley and blocks quite a bit.

1281
01:24:24.74 --> 01:24:29.74
So you, I cut you off or whatever, but so how was that first one that you and got?

1282
01:24:29.74 --> 01:24:32.74
The needle went in. So I was laying on this hot, this bed.

1283
01:24:32.74 --> 01:24:36.74
So the, the process is that they stick a needle into some part of your neck brain.

1284
01:24:36.74 --> 01:24:39.74
Well, so your neck. So like they do it under ultrasound.

1285
01:24:39.74 --> 01:24:44.74
And like a stick this needle on and, and it like, um, it's a block.

1286
01:24:44.74 --> 01:24:48.74
Um, and it goes on your, it goes on one of your nerves.

1287
01:24:48.74 --> 01:24:51.74
And, um, it's like a reset.

1288
01:24:51.74 --> 01:24:54.74
And, man, as soon as before the needle was even out,

1289
01:24:54.74 --> 01:24:58.74
I remember I was looking at, I was like literally looking at the ceiling.

1290
01:24:58.74 --> 01:25:05.74
And I didn't want anybody to talk because I got, I couldn't believe that,

1291
01:25:05.74 --> 01:25:07.74
that, that I could feel this way.

1292
01:25:07.74 --> 01:25:11.74
Like, there was like the world, the way to the world was off my shoulders.

1293
01:25:11.74 --> 01:25:15.74
Like the anxiety was gone. Like it was, like I didn't know you could feel like that.

1294
01:25:15.74 --> 01:25:19.74
And I was just, the next morning, like I was taking a shower.

1295
01:25:19.74 --> 01:25:23.74
And I was, I caught myself like laughing and singing in the shower.

1296
01:25:23.74 --> 01:25:26.74
And I was like, this is like amazing.

1297
01:25:26.74 --> 01:25:30.74
And, um, so I did that and that worked for a while.

1298
01:25:30.74 --> 01:25:31.74
What's it blocking?

1299
01:25:31.74 --> 01:25:37.74
So I guess what it does is, is you have, you have, um, this is how I was explaining to me was,

1300
01:25:37.74 --> 01:25:44.74
as you have your automated, um, basically like where you automatically do things like breathing.

1301
01:25:44.74 --> 01:25:46.74
Things you don't have to think about, blinking.

1302
01:25:46.74 --> 01:25:53.74
And then you have your, um, where you have to like your manual side of your, your nervous system.

1303
01:25:53.74 --> 01:25:55.74
Right? Like we're okay. I want to pick this cup up.

1304
01:25:55.74 --> 01:25:57.74
I have to think about that and do it.

1305
01:25:57.74 --> 01:26:02.74
So fighter flight is supposed to be, I recognize you as a threat.

1306
01:26:02.74 --> 01:26:05.74
You're a threat now. So I recognize that.

1307
01:26:05.74 --> 01:26:07.74
Now I go into fighter flight.

1308
01:26:07.74 --> 01:26:12.74
And what happens is, is when we've been in that mode for so long,

1309
01:26:12.74 --> 01:26:17.74
your mind just starts to adapt and it puts it over into the automated side.

1310
01:26:17.74 --> 01:26:24.74
And so that's where you get these guys who are automatically back in that fighter flight.

1311
01:26:24.74 --> 01:26:29.74
Um, they automatically go back there because their brain has, has shoved in that system.

1312
01:26:29.74 --> 01:26:34.74
So, so you're kind of like a, imagine with your, your cell phone.

1313
01:26:34.74 --> 01:26:38.74
If it's running wrong or an apps running wrong, what do you do? You reboot it.

1314
01:26:38.74 --> 01:26:42.74
Well, that's what this block does. It doesn't really shut it down,

1315
01:26:42.74 --> 01:26:44.74
but it kind of helps you reboot your system.

1316
01:26:44.74 --> 01:26:49.74
And that's Dr. Muldany was one of the first guys to ever give this for PTSD.

1317
01:26:49.74 --> 01:26:53.74
And what he did was, is he went, he was, I guess he was at this clinic.

1318
01:26:53.74 --> 01:27:01.74
And he was seeing all these symptoms that, uh, pregnant women were having, um,

1319
01:27:01.74 --> 01:27:04.74
when they were, when they were going through pregnancies.

1320
01:27:04.74 --> 01:27:06.74
And they were giving this, I guess it for some piece of it.

1321
01:27:06.74 --> 01:27:11.74
And he's like, well, this is kind of, these symptoms are kind of, let me try it for this.

1322
01:27:11.74 --> 01:27:14.74
And like, it's been huge.

1323
01:27:14.74 --> 01:27:18.74
I'm saved. So, I mean, saving lives like a lot of the guys get it, you know?

1324
01:27:18.74 --> 01:27:21.74
And, um, it helped me for a long time.

1325
01:27:21.74 --> 01:27:25.74
Yeah, I got, I got, I got some people that have been reaching out to me to talk about it.

1326
01:27:25.74 --> 01:27:28.74
Maybe you have some of the experts on here to kind of explain it.

1327
01:27:28.74 --> 01:27:33.74
So more people can understand it. And, uh, and actually when they approached me,

1328
01:27:33.74 --> 01:27:36.74
I said, well, I got a friend that had it. And I actually asked you.

1329
01:27:36.74 --> 01:27:38.74
And I said, did you get that thing? You said you opened as an, how was it?

1330
01:27:38.74 --> 01:27:39.74
You said it's freaking awesome.

1331
01:27:39.74 --> 01:27:40.74
Awesome.

1332
01:27:40.74 --> 01:27:42.74
So that kind of opened my mind up and said, all right, you know,

1333
01:27:42.74 --> 01:27:45.74
for the virus can help spread the word on this, then let's do it.

1334
01:27:45.74 --> 01:27:48.74
Yeah, and, you know, like, all these things are, like, let me say this.

1335
01:27:48.74 --> 01:27:52.74
Like, like, the, the alpha stem, it was, it was great.

1336
01:27:52.74 --> 01:27:54.74
Worked great, right? Uh, the still like, angley and black.

1337
01:27:54.74 --> 01:27:59.74
Like, all these things, they work. Um, it's just a matter of how long they work, right?

1338
01:27:59.74 --> 01:28:02.74
Like, the alpha stem, I'd have to use it pretty much every day, right?

1339
01:28:02.74 --> 01:28:06.74
The still like angley and black. I mean, sometimes I would go six months without getting

1340
01:28:06.74 --> 01:28:12.74
one. Sometimes I'd have to go three months. You know, it just, it's about the longevity of how long they

1341
01:28:12.74 --> 01:28:16.74
worked. You know, and, and honestly, none of it's going to fix it.

1342
01:28:16.74 --> 01:28:22.74
You have to fix it yourself. Like, these are all, I call them, uh, they're kind of like flash

1343
01:28:22.74 --> 01:28:27.74
bangs. Um, they're, they're the flash bangs of life. It's going to, it's, you're going to

1344
01:28:27.74 --> 01:28:30.74
throw that flash bang in there. And it's going to give you some time to get on the

1345
01:28:30.74 --> 01:28:36.74
offense and work there on the defense. Um, right? So you better make you better fix it

1346
01:28:36.74 --> 01:28:42.74
of whatever's causing it. You better get in there and start doing work as soon as as soon as

1347
01:28:42.74 --> 01:28:46.74
as soon as it, as soon as you get it. Right? It's not a, you're not going to sit here and take it

1348
01:28:46.74 --> 01:28:50.74
and, and there, you know, you'd not have to go home and work on your life and work on the way you

1349
01:28:50.74 --> 01:28:54.74
think about things. You know, you got work to do.

1350
01:28:54.74 --> 01:28:58.74
So, we, we, yeah. So what's that work look like? Because when you, I know what I do when I

1351
01:28:58.74 --> 01:29:02.74
throw a flash, flash bang in the room, I know what to do next. I know what that work is.

1352
01:29:02.74 --> 01:29:08.34
What's the work when that you're talking about? I mean, look, some people want to go do some

1353
01:29:08.34 --> 01:29:13.54
counseling, right? Go into talking to people. What I say with people go to counseling, I say,

1354
01:29:13.54 --> 01:29:20.50
uh, I tell people, if you don't have goals, don't go to counseling. Like, don't go into

1355
01:29:20.50 --> 01:29:25.62
counseling and, and think that it's going to be somebody else fixing it for you. Um, it's kind of like

1356
01:29:25.62 --> 01:29:30.02
calling up a trainer and thinking that you, you know, you can go to the best gym, you can have the

1357
01:29:30.02 --> 01:29:33.62
best trainer and the best nutritionist, but you still got to put it in the work, you still got to eat

1358
01:29:33.62 --> 01:29:37.86
the right food, and you still got to show up and do it, right? And, and it's kind of the same thing

1359
01:29:37.86 --> 01:29:43.86
with counselors. Um, know what you want changed. You know, you know, really look at, take a hard

1360
01:29:43.86 --> 01:29:48.58
look in the mirror and, and it starts with accountability and like a lot of people want to

1361
01:29:48.58 --> 01:29:52.42
avoid accountability because as soon as you recognize, as soon as you say and look in the mirror,

1362
01:29:52.42 --> 01:29:56.66
it's like, hey, I'm fat. Well, then you've made a conscious choice not to do something about it.

1363
01:29:57.78 --> 01:30:04.82
And, um, so for me, like, I know that I have to get, like, usually I, I look in the mirror and I

1364
01:30:04.82 --> 01:30:09.06
start seeing who I'm surrounded by. Like, when I start going down that road, the first thing I look at,

1365
01:30:09.78 --> 01:30:17.70
where am I spending my time? Um, and that usually tells me the most of it, right? So I'll back off

1366
01:30:17.70 --> 01:30:23.70
of that and then, um, and then I just start, I start, you know, if I need to go to counselor,

1367
01:30:23.70 --> 01:30:27.94
if I want to talk to people, I'll talk to people. But most time for me, like, I want to talk to

1368
01:30:28.66 --> 01:30:33.70
I'll call you or I'll call, I call people and they don't even know why I'm calling them,

1369
01:30:33.70 --> 01:30:39.54
but I'll call them. I'll call them. We're just to get out. Whenever you're free,

1370
01:30:39.54 --> 01:30:46.74
get me pops up on my phone. I'm like, here we go. I like, do I have an hour? Yes, I do. We're living

1371
01:30:46.74 --> 01:30:51.06
a rocker. Oh, I don't know what I know. I'm like, it's good to be doing. Sometimes I get out the

1372
01:30:51.06 --> 01:30:56.42
phone with you. I was sitting on my front porch talking to you one day. I got a phone, I called you

1373
01:30:56.42 --> 01:31:00.58
for like five minutes and we were on the phone for an hour and I got off the phone and I'm like,

1374
01:31:00.58 --> 01:31:04.50
I promise you, I won't back in. I'm like, I don't even know why this guy answers the phone for me.

1375
01:31:05.70 --> 01:31:12.58
I remember the one time we were talking and when I got off my wife was like, who was that?

1376
01:31:12.58 --> 01:31:18.90
I was like, it was Dakota. She goes, I have never heard you laugh. So freaking hard for so long.

1377
01:31:20.02 --> 01:31:26.98
One time I remember I was in my kitchen and I had tears. Literally tears were coming out of my eyes.

1378
01:31:26.98 --> 01:31:33.94
I was laughing. So freaking hard at what you were telling me and man, and that's happened a few times.

1379
01:31:33.94 --> 01:31:41.86
It's happened a few times. I mean, oh yeah. So yeah, I know when I see that when I see the

1380
01:31:41.86 --> 01:31:46.42
code of pop up on my phone, I'm like, all right. Yeah. I should freaking record those things.

1381
01:31:46.42 --> 01:31:50.66
Yeah, I could record them for counseling. I could record them for podcasts or I could record them

1382
01:31:50.66 --> 01:31:57.54
for comic freaking relief. Yeah, you know, because like you, you, you don't help it though.

1383
01:31:57.54 --> 01:32:04.10
Like let me say this. You, you are like the fuel of it because because I'll say something.

1384
01:32:04.82 --> 01:32:09.14
And you'll say like a few little words just like, you know, like I'll be coming down and he'll just

1385
01:32:09.14 --> 01:32:14.34
like say something else and gauge and it's like, there we go again. Yeah. No, I remember one time you

1386
01:32:14.34 --> 01:32:19.94
called me two and you were like, man, you were ready to go hot. Oh, I was. And I was like, all right,

1387
01:32:19.94 --> 01:32:24.58
man, and actually I remember what I said, I said, okay, let's think about this strategically.

1388
01:32:24.58 --> 01:32:28.34
Let's think about this strategically. Well, if you execute what you're talking about,

1389
01:32:28.34 --> 01:32:36.02
execute me. I said, where are you? You've been six months, where are you going to be three years?

1390
01:32:36.02 --> 01:32:39.62
Where you can be five years like that was pretty much all I had to say. Did you get it? Yeah.

1391
01:32:41.62 --> 01:32:46.90
Oh, oh, yeah, I remember that conversation. Yeah.

1392
01:32:47.78 --> 01:32:53.70
Jock, Jock, Jock told me was and he didn't say not to do it. I understand. He didn't say not to do it.

1393
01:32:53.70 --> 01:33:01.30
He, he, he said, hey, he said, if you're going to do it, um, like only do it if it's worth

1394
01:33:01.30 --> 01:33:08.82
losing everything. That's exactly what he told me. And that's a picture. And then that's what I left with.

1395
01:33:08.82 --> 01:33:13.86
And I was walking around Lowe's and I was like, yeah, I don't think further yet. All right,

1396
01:33:13.86 --> 01:33:17.30
so that's working around. So what is the hard work story? Are you going to do it?

1397
01:33:17.30 --> 01:33:22.18
We're not talking about that. We're not talking about that, but we will say it was not legal.

1398
01:33:24.18 --> 01:33:28.42
No way. It was no way. When I had already thought it, you had a freaking course of action

1399
01:33:28.42 --> 01:33:32.74
before me. It was called the freaking battlefield command. He was like, hey, boss, I got a

1400
01:33:32.74 --> 01:33:36.90
course of action. I want to run by you. See if I can get mission execute on this thing. I'm like,

1401
01:33:36.90 --> 01:33:41.94
okay, go ahead. You know, I'm all ears. What you got? Seven minutes later, you know, he's running through

1402
01:33:41.94 --> 01:33:47.78
time line. Oh, that's a cute check list. I'm like, okay, I already had the cover up story.

1403
01:33:47.78 --> 01:33:59.62
Right. Yeah. Man. But like that to me is like that. Like, but as you know what, like, but I know who

1404
01:33:59.62 --> 01:34:05.78
to call, right? Like, I know in that situation, I'm not going to call some idiot. You know what,

1405
01:34:05.78 --> 01:34:09.62
I mean, because next thing you know, they're like, we're going to meet you. We're doing right?

1406
01:34:11.06 --> 01:34:17.22
I know, I know, like, I'm so fortunate. I got, I've got all, like, I've got quite a few, just people

1407
01:34:17.22 --> 01:34:23.14
that I just look up to so much. And I trust. I trust like, like, you like, if you tell me something,

1408
01:34:23.14 --> 01:34:29.62
like, I know, I know it's what you would do. And so I trust that, right? Like, I know it's exactly

1409
01:34:29.62 --> 01:34:35.30
what you believe in what you would do. And so like, that's why I would call you with something like that.

1410
01:34:35.30 --> 01:34:41.86
Or I would call you. And that's for me, that's that's my, that's how I fix myself.

1411
01:34:41.86 --> 01:34:48.26
You're, I mean, yeah, no, it's, it's, it's, uh, believe it or not, if you have people around you,

1412
01:34:48.26 --> 01:34:53.94
that can, are, are on the same wavelength as you, it's a method of actually detaching from the

1413
01:34:53.94 --> 01:34:57.54
situation, because you're all wrapped up in it, right? You're with the emotions and all this stuff.

1414
01:34:57.54 --> 01:35:01.54
You're all wrapped up up. And I'm not just saying you, but any human echo could be all wrapped up

1415
01:35:01.54 --> 01:35:05.46
on some emotional thing and call me up and be like, hey, this is what's going on. This is what I want to do.

1416
01:35:06.02 --> 01:35:11.38
Because we're bros, I, I'm thinking in your best interest. I'm thinking in your best interest.

1417
01:35:11.38 --> 01:35:16.58
So I'm, but I'm not wrapped up in it. So I can say, hey, man, let's think through what you want to do

1418
01:35:16.58 --> 01:35:22.82
right now. Let's see what the long term. I mean, and that why, like, in fights, I mean, their coaches are in

1419
01:35:22.82 --> 01:35:27.70
the coaches are there. The coaches in the corner, right? Like, the coaches and out there necessarily,

1420
01:35:28.26 --> 01:35:33.06
you know, engaging or necessarily having to put in the physical piece of it, but the coaches make

1421
01:35:33.06 --> 01:35:38.10
sure that guy doesn't get too emotional, making sure to, to stay stick to the plan exactly.

1422
01:35:38.10 --> 01:35:45.22
And, and that's why it's so important in life, you know, like even back when all this media stuff

1423
01:35:45.22 --> 01:35:52.18
used to go on, and I would get hammered. Like, I have a few people who are very, the one at some

1424
01:35:52.18 --> 01:35:58.90
of the best in the media world. And I'll back up and call them. And you know what I make a rule.

1425
01:35:58.90 --> 01:36:02.82
I make a rule that as soon as I pick up the phone, like, I'm not calling you for advice.

1426
01:36:02.82 --> 01:36:08.82
Like, when I call you about that, like, if you say don't, don't do this or, or, hey, do this,

1427
01:36:08.82 --> 01:36:12.98
why listen to that? Because I picked up the phone and I called and asked it, like, I'm not

1428
01:36:12.98 --> 01:36:17.46
going to sit here and ask you and then go do something stupid because like, why would I even waste

1429
01:36:17.46 --> 01:36:22.26
your time? You know, and, and that's, I think that's so important to have those people in your life,

1430
01:36:24.26 --> 01:36:29.62
to be that logic side when you get into the emotional side too much. You know, for sure.

1431
01:36:29.62 --> 01:36:36.26
All right. So we're getting the the Stelet gangly and block and that's sort of

1432
01:36:36.98 --> 01:36:42.74
giving you the opportunity to work some of these things out. You know, the weird thing is

1433
01:36:42.74 --> 01:36:48.82
that's thinking about. So one of the things that I know for a fact, right? So, you know,

1434
01:36:48.82 --> 01:36:54.42
for me, I'll go and talk to a company or I'll go and talk to people or I'll talk on this podcast

1435
01:36:54.42 --> 01:37:04.58
about the worst days of my life, right, when I lost guys and it's, I believe it's helpful

1436
01:37:04.58 --> 01:37:08.82
because I've like, okay, I've talked about, I've written this down, I've explained what this

1437
01:37:08.82 --> 01:37:18.82
situation is, even even, you know, giving like, ulegies for my friends at their, at their

1438
01:37:19.54 --> 01:37:23.94
memorial services, like you have to kind of think through things and you have to process them and

1439
01:37:23.94 --> 01:37:30.10
then you write down and then you like even that for me, it's socks and it's freaking horrible,

1440
01:37:30.10 --> 01:37:36.18
but at the same time, I know that it allows me to sort of gather together my thoughts and put them

1441
01:37:36.18 --> 01:37:40.82
in some kind of perspective. And when you write something down, you're actually attaching from it.

1442
01:37:40.82 --> 01:37:45.62
You're actually attaching from it. You're, you're, it's on the paper. It's, it's actually on the paper.

1443
01:37:46.34 --> 01:37:50.98
And then when you talk to some people about it, it's like, oh, you get to see their perspective,

1444
01:37:50.98 --> 01:37:58.10
they get to give you some of their perspective about it. And so it's a way of, um, um,

1445
01:37:58.10 --> 01:38:02.02
I guess just working through the problem, like it's like almost like stretching your when you're

1446
01:38:02.02 --> 01:38:06.10
sore, you know, you stretch out, right? It's almost like that. Hey, I'm going to get some blood back

1447
01:38:06.10 --> 01:38:11.22
in there. I'm going to think through this and the difference for you, like in those early days,

1448
01:38:12.26 --> 01:38:18.66
people are just putting their perspective on you. It's like just layering it on you all the time.

1449
01:38:18.66 --> 01:38:24.90
Yeah, and like let me ask you, yeah. So like when you, like what, how old, like where were you

1450
01:38:24.90 --> 01:38:33.94
at in your life? Like when you lost your guys? 30, five. Okay. Were you married? Yes. Okay. So like

1451
01:38:35.30 --> 01:38:43.62
so like check. So like how old are you right now? I'm 32. Yeah. So so my, my thing is is right is like

1452
01:38:43.62 --> 01:38:54.26
what, what would have happened if you know, you, you, you, you, you had that it happened 10 years before.

1453
01:38:54.26 --> 01:38:58.74
For sure. You know, you know what I mean? So like I think that's what's, I think that's where you,

1454
01:38:58.74 --> 01:39:04.42
like that, that's, that's, that's what's awesome about is like you're kind of like,

1455
01:39:04.42 --> 01:39:14.50
for just for me. I'll talk about for me. Like you're the, you're, you're the, I can, like you're the,

1456
01:39:14.50 --> 01:39:18.98
you're the better side of this. Like I can, like you, you give hope to a guy like me.

1457
01:39:20.10 --> 01:39:25.78
They, man, I can get there. I can, I can, I can, I can be okay. Like this ain't this ain't like the

1458
01:39:25.78 --> 01:39:30.26
realities that are in my mind sometimes. Like I understand, like I can look at somebody and say,

1459
01:39:30.26 --> 01:39:35.62
look, no, no, this isn't realities. Like I'm not, I, I will figure this out. If I, if I, if I hang around

1460
01:39:35.62 --> 01:39:41.70
people, if I hang around jocco and I take that and I take that mentorship, I can be that someday.

1461
01:39:41.70 --> 01:39:47.94
I can get there someday. I can literally look at it. It's not an idea. Your reality. And for a guy like

1462
01:39:47.94 --> 01:39:52.90
me, that's reality. And I think that's, but, but on the back side of it, you're not giving me,

1463
01:39:53.46 --> 01:39:59.30
you're not giving me advice. The guys, if I talk to my buddies, like I'm taking advice from a guy who

1464
01:39:59.30 --> 01:40:08.18
seen it at at 23 21 myself, right? You got to see it from a perspective at an older age with a different

1465
01:40:08.18 --> 01:40:16.58
life. 100% my whole, in fact, my whole experience of like being in combat was the most,

1466
01:40:17.94 --> 01:40:22.26
the most gentle, like rot, like the first operations I did were like, no, that was like nothing.

1467
01:40:22.26 --> 01:40:26.34
Like cool, we're going outside the while. It was like this really nice, kind of ramp, slow ramp.

1468
01:40:26.34 --> 01:40:31.62
It wasn't just like, oh, welcome to combat. You know, everything's freaking crazy. So I,

1469
01:40:31.62 --> 01:40:38.18
you know, even like the, the just the nervousness about of being like, oh, this is real. Like,

1470
01:40:38.18 --> 01:40:42.82
that was, I was very lucky. Yeah. I got that out of my system. The first five

1471
01:40:42.82 --> 01:40:46.98
ops I went on, and nothing happened, right? I was like, oh, okay, cool, I kind of got this, right?

1472
01:40:46.98 --> 01:40:52.10
And then it, it was just a slow kind of ramp from there. And, and yes, I was old.

1473
01:40:52.10 --> 01:40:56.90
I mean, I can't believe I was three years older than you are, right, freaking now.

1474
01:40:56.90 --> 01:40:59.86
I'm, let's, but crazy. And I'd spent my whole life in the military.

1475
01:41:01.06 --> 01:41:07.86
And that's what, you know, so the, yeah, I was a huge, I was very, very lucky in the way things unfolded

1476
01:41:07.86 --> 01:41:13.54
from it. And, and when things, if they got, when they got, not good for you,

1477
01:41:14.90 --> 01:41:17.86
you had a person in your life that you trusted with everything.

1478
01:41:17.86 --> 01:41:23.78
That you knew if you were starting to get off the path, you knew you could look at her and

1479
01:41:23.78 --> 01:41:29.62
you could have a good gauge. You had a, you had a very good gauge of the man that you were.

1480
01:41:30.50 --> 01:41:36.58
Yeah, and I think more than that, um, in my own mind, I realized that I needed to.

1481
01:41:37.30 --> 01:41:40.82
And I, I'll tell you what I talked about this with J.P. when J.P. was on here. And, um,

1482
01:41:40.82 --> 01:41:50.58
and so when, when Mikey got killed, we were sending him home. And he was, so we're going into

1483
01:41:50.58 --> 01:41:58.82
like a connex box to like say goodbye to him one at a time. And like I walk, so basically you can walk

1484
01:41:58.82 --> 01:42:06.10
in the connex box. You see, Mike, you know, freaking give him a kiss and say goodbye. And then turn around

1485
01:42:06.10 --> 01:42:16.58
and walk back out. And, um, I remember just looking at J.P. and because J.P. was like right ahead of me

1486
01:42:16.58 --> 01:42:23.86
walking in and as he's walking back out, like I, I see J.P. and J.P. was 22 or 23 years old.

1487
01:42:25.06 --> 01:42:33.06
And this was his bro. And I look at his face and he is just fucking just absolute torment in his face.

1488
01:42:33.06 --> 01:42:39.38
And I said to myself like, hey, J.P. you better keep your shit together right now. Because

1489
01:42:40.58 --> 01:42:44.98
like you said earlier, like it's like a breaking point. And people, if one person breaks it's,

1490
01:42:44.98 --> 01:42:49.38
and on the guy that's allegedly in charge. And if I break down right now, man,

1491
01:42:50.26 --> 01:42:54.90
it's going to be what it's going to be a nightmare. And I remember seeing him be turned around. He

1492
01:42:54.90 --> 01:42:59.86
looked at me in the eyes and his face was just tormented and, and J.P. is such a passionate guy. And he's

1493
01:42:59.86 --> 01:43:05.62
so emotional and, and he was young, you know. And I just remember, I said, I better,

1494
01:43:05.62 --> 01:43:12.90
you gotta keep your shit together right now. Because they, because, you know, they need you.

1495
01:43:12.90 --> 01:43:19.14
Right, they need you to act like a fucking man right now. And that's what I had to do. And I kind of

1496
01:43:19.14 --> 01:43:23.06
felt like, you know, with with my wife, with my family, it's the same type of thing. Like,

1497
01:43:23.06 --> 01:43:27.86
hey, you got a hold the line. Like, you got to, you got to do this. And look, my wife's

1498
01:43:27.86 --> 01:43:32.66
a freaking badass. You know, she's the one that was, you know, I think, I didn't go to Mikey's funeral.

1499
01:43:33.22 --> 01:43:37.30
I was still in Iraq. I didn't go to Mark's funeral. I was still in Iraq. Like, this is,

1500
01:43:37.70 --> 01:43:43.06
this is, this is my wife going to those things, you know. So, and she's, by the way, she's got three

1501
01:43:43.06 --> 01:43:48.50
kids. You know, she's getting a baby sitter so she can go to my friends' funerals. So, I'm not trying

1502
01:43:48.50 --> 01:43:54.98
to sit here and say, like, oh, I had to be all, all strong. She had to be strong. But that's what,

1503
01:43:54.98 --> 01:44:05.06
um, I guess to your point, I was older. I had a little bit more life experience, um, and, you know,

1504
01:44:05.06 --> 01:44:09.62
as you get older, you're, you're more able to handle things and put them in perspective.

1505
01:44:10.50 --> 01:44:20.18
Yeah, I mean, at, so like, at 33, that would be 12 years older than what I was when it happened to me.

1506
01:44:20.18 --> 01:44:26.34
You know, and I'm, by no means, I'm not, I'm not saying that it's either way or the other. I'm

1507
01:44:26.34 --> 01:44:32.66
just saying that like, the world's a little bit different than, right? And, and, and, you know,

1508
01:44:32.66 --> 01:44:38.26
like, the maturity levels of how I handled a lot of it is not the right way. You know what I mean? Like,

1509
01:44:38.26 --> 01:44:43.22
was drinking and, and going out and, and, you know, punching people in the face, like, you know,

1510
01:44:43.22 --> 01:44:47.86
and in the new book, we, we have coming out, right? Like, I talk about like, you know, I've just,

1511
01:44:47.86 --> 01:44:52.26
I mean, I was evil. Like, I don't want to tell you, like, I came back and,

1512
01:44:53.86 --> 01:45:01.70
I mean, I was mean. How was mean? And the problem was is like, when you take mean and you take a

1513
01:45:01.70 --> 01:45:06.66
guy who doesn't care and a guy who felt like he's already lost everything, like that is a dangerous

1514
01:45:06.66 --> 01:45:12.98
dude. Like, I would, it was nasty. I would say stuff. Like, I hurt my family. I mean, I would say

1515
01:45:12.98 --> 01:45:19.62
do stuff and it's just, you know, and, and I'm not saying like, I just didn't handle it right.

1516
01:45:19.62 --> 01:45:24.10
And I didn't have anybody there to, to hold the line with me. You know, like,

1517
01:45:25.22 --> 01:45:30.02
I mean, everybody, I, I mean, my whole team was gone. Like, everybody, like, my, the leaders

1518
01:45:30.02 --> 01:45:38.02
on my team were gone. And, um, yeah, I mean, you know, do I regret it? I regret it a ton of it.

1519
01:45:38.02 --> 01:45:42.74
And maybe if I had dealt with it better and maybe I had, you know, you just never know, right?

1520
01:45:42.74 --> 01:45:46.26
And, um, but yeah, it's just, it's different. It's different.

1521
01:45:47.46 --> 01:45:51.46
This is bringing me back to something you were talking about earlier. And I just want to,

1522
01:45:52.90 --> 01:45:58.18
so you're talking earlier about like having a mentor and having people. And I, I just want to say,

1523
01:45:58.18 --> 01:46:03.70
like, you know, if you're in a position where you can help somebody out, that maybe you've

1524
01:46:03.70 --> 01:46:08.02
already been through the haunted house and you can give them a heads up. And I think people when

1525
01:46:08.02 --> 01:46:13.06
they hear being a mentor, it's isn't like this has to be some official thing. Like, hello,

1526
01:46:13.06 --> 01:46:16.74
Dakota, okay. What do you like me to mentor you? Is this not what I'm talking about?

1527
01:46:17.54 --> 01:46:24.42
But just being being someone that can indirectly say, hey, man, how's it going? Okay,

1528
01:46:24.42 --> 01:46:28.02
what are you doing with that? Hey, what are you, what are you thinking is going to happen next?

1529
01:46:28.02 --> 01:46:32.74
Just those kind of comments to be a mentor. You don't have to sign up and you don't have to,

1530
01:46:32.74 --> 01:46:37.06
you don't have to freaking go through a course. You know, there's no eight week, what,

1531
01:46:37.06 --> 01:46:42.42
what, what, what, what was your baby care course code? There's no course for how to handle a 22 year

1532
01:46:42.42 --> 01:46:47.78
old or whatever. It doesn't exist. But just giving sharing your experience and the, the other

1533
01:46:47.78 --> 01:46:52.98
thing is you don't have to be perfect. I'm damn far from, I'm not even, I'm not even the same ballpark.

1534
01:46:53.70 --> 01:46:58.66
Right? You don't have to be perfect to be able to say, hey, listen, Dakota, when this happened to me,

1535
01:46:59.94 --> 01:47:03.94
here's what I did. Here's the actual mistakes that I made. Yeah. Right? The, the,

1536
01:47:03.94 --> 01:47:08.90
the, here's the things that I freaking completely screwed up, watch out for these things. So it's not

1537
01:47:08.90 --> 01:47:15.46
hey Dakota, here's what I'm doing and I was perfect. No, not even close. So maybe you might be

1538
01:47:15.46 --> 01:47:21.86
thinking, listen, this like, well, oh, uh, uh, you know, I'm not good enough to be someone's mentor,

1539
01:47:21.86 --> 01:47:27.54
bullshit or maybe you think I don't want to be someone's mentor, bullshit. Be someone's friend

1540
01:47:27.54 --> 01:47:31.86
build a relationship with them and show them the freaking path through the haunted house, tell them

1541
01:47:31.86 --> 01:47:36.50
what they can expect. Even if you screwed it up, it's better than it's better than not than letting them

1542
01:47:36.50 --> 01:47:42.42
just, you know, get, get in a bad situation, but don't try to mentor them on something you have

1543
01:47:42.42 --> 01:47:50.58
not gone through. Don't say it up front. That's got to be your disclosure. Yeah. Of, you know,

1544
01:47:50.58 --> 01:47:57.22
and, and like, I'm so fortunate because like, man, I'm, I'm surrounded by people I don't deserve.

1545
01:47:57.22 --> 01:48:02.10
Like, I've got, I, I, I, I mean, I, I'm just so fortunate to have just great people. I can pick up

1546
01:48:02.10 --> 01:48:07.86
the phone and call it, hey, what do you think about this, right? And, you know, I tell you the

1547
01:48:07.86 --> 01:48:11.30
one thing that I cut out when, whenever I start going, you know, when I tell you, I have to do

1548
01:48:11.30 --> 01:48:16.42
that self reflection and look around. The people who are feeding into my bullshit are the people

1549
01:48:16.42 --> 01:48:21.70
that have to go. Like, the people who hype me up on my bullshit, like when I call up and I'm like,

1550
01:48:21.70 --> 01:48:25.70
who, yeah, what do you think about this? Oh, you know, like, not that bullshit or whatever,

1551
01:48:25.70 --> 01:48:31.06
right? Like, that's the first people that have to go. I don't, I don't need a cheerleading squad.

1552
01:48:31.78 --> 01:48:35.78
You know, I, I need people who are going to look at me like Tim Kennedy. Like, Tim Kennedy

1553
01:48:35.78 --> 01:48:39.46
looking at me and saying like, you know, I, I, I, I, I, I'm there forget one of the, we were working

1554
01:48:39.46 --> 01:48:44.26
out one time. And, um, I said something, he could tell us down. I was, you know, I was going through

1555
01:48:44.26 --> 01:48:48.42
my divorce and stuff. And I, I looked at him and I said, man, I'd made like a offhand

1556
01:48:48.42 --> 01:48:53.70
comment like, gosh, I'm, I'm fat. And he, like, Tim stopped what he was doing and he looked at me and

1557
01:48:53.70 --> 01:49:00.66
he said, hey, check it out. He said, you, when people hear your name, they look at you as a warrior.

1558
01:49:00.66 --> 01:49:05.46
When you walk on stage, they expect a warrior. When you talk, they expect a warrior. When you

1559
01:49:05.46 --> 01:49:08.26
wake up in the morning, they expect a warrior. So you know what you need to do? You need to look

1560
01:49:08.26 --> 01:49:13.30
in the mirror and he started acting like one. And that was it. Turn around went back to work out, right?

1561
01:49:13.30 --> 01:49:20.34
But that's what I need, right? Like, was that like a kick to me? 100%. But like, I don't need people

1562
01:49:20.34 --> 01:49:25.78
to, to feed in to, to my bullshit. I need people who are going to hold me accountable to standards

1563
01:49:25.78 --> 01:49:31.86
that I can't even hold myself to, to, to know what I can be and hold me to that standard. No,

1564
01:49:31.86 --> 01:49:39.62
hold the line when I don't even see it myself. Yeah, no doubt. And Tim Kennedy is one of those

1565
01:49:39.62 --> 01:49:46.26
common at you. Coming at your life. When he calls me, it's always going to, like, he calls

1566
01:49:46.26 --> 01:49:50.98
me for like reasons. He's like, hey, this is what's going on. He's like ready to brief me. It's

1567
01:49:50.98 --> 01:49:54.26
freaking legit. He's like, hey, here's what's going on. I got this this next time. Hey, Roger that.

1568
01:49:54.26 --> 01:49:59.06
Well, let me think about this. Okay, here's a move. You know, or whatever, here's a deal. Like,

1569
01:49:59.78 --> 01:50:04.42
like, if I call Tim Kennedy up and I said, hey, man, like if he thought I was filling

1570
01:50:04.42 --> 01:50:08.26
so far for myself, I was like, hey, man, I think I'm just going to end it today. Like, I honestly

1571
01:50:08.26 --> 01:50:11.70
think that Tim would be like, oh, I just make sure you leave all your cool, like, how can I have your

1572
01:50:11.70 --> 01:50:18.18
two guns? Like, he's not going to play the sip. Like, if I needed something to know, like, the

1573
01:50:18.18 --> 01:50:23.30
dude would be like, like, hey, I killed this guy. All right, well, well, I'll bring the shovel.

1574
01:50:23.30 --> 01:50:28.34
You know what I mean? Like, but I know these guys are like that. Yeah. And that's where I'm so

1575
01:50:28.34 --> 01:50:33.06
fortunate because I got that circle, right? Like, that circle is everything. Yeah. And I guess

1576
01:50:33.46 --> 01:50:39.30
what I'm saying is that's awesome. And everybody that's listening, you can actually be part of

1577
01:50:39.30 --> 01:50:46.34
that circle for somebody else. 100%. 100%. And if you do that, man, you, you, you make such a huge

1578
01:50:46.34 --> 01:50:55.70
impact in people's lives by doing that. So how long was this stellar gangly and block like of

1579
01:50:55.70 --> 01:51:04.66
the deal? Are you still getting that? I don't like, I, um, I probably did it up until 2020.

1580
01:51:04.66 --> 01:51:16.10
Um, and then my buddy, um, I was struggling real bad. Like, I was, it just, well, I don't know.

1581
01:51:16.10 --> 01:51:22.82
I was just still, I was still struggling with it, right? And, um, he's like, you got to get

1582
01:51:22.82 --> 01:51:30.50
you're going to Mexico. And I was like, for what? He said, don't worry about it. You're going to Mexico.

1583
01:51:30.50 --> 01:51:38.50
I, he said quite a few veterans are going down there. Guys, I trusted he named off a few people that

1584
01:51:38.50 --> 01:51:46.82
I trusted had gone to this. And I said, all right. And so I booked a trip and flew into San Diego. And so

1585
01:51:47.46 --> 01:51:56.74
I was going down to do, uh, it's a therapy, uh, with I will gain and five in me, ODMT and

1586
01:51:56.74 --> 01:52:05.86
then something that I would defer this thing that I could, you could ever get me to be around.

1587
01:52:05.86 --> 01:52:12.26
I was like, this is complete bullshit. And honestly, I was going to go and I told the doctor

1588
01:52:12.26 --> 01:52:17.38
when I got there, I said, hey, I'm coming to this. Just so I can walk away from this and tell

1589
01:52:17.38 --> 01:52:22.98
people that this is all this all bullshit. And I told him that I said, as soon as this doesn't

1590
01:52:22.98 --> 01:52:28.50
work, I'm going to go on every podcast. And I'm going to tell everybody that this is all dissolved.

1591
01:52:28.50 --> 01:52:34.18
So what, what were you going for? What was it? It's called Ibo gain. Okay. And it comes from a

1592
01:52:34.18 --> 01:52:38.34
root. What was the other thing that you said? Five in me, O, it comes from a toad, DMT.

1593
01:52:39.30 --> 01:52:44.66
So this is when Mike Tyson and and Joe Rogan are talking about riding the toad. This is what they're

1594
01:52:44.66 --> 01:52:51.30
talking about. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I went down there and I was in a

1595
01:52:51.30 --> 01:52:57.86
bad. Like I was still like my anxiety just you know, and for me, like the only thing that I like

1596
01:52:57.86 --> 01:53:03.06
when I look back at it, whatever, what would always got me to the point of where I'm like, I don't

1597
01:53:03.06 --> 01:53:09.06
know if I'm going to wake up tomorrow was anxiety. For like the best way to describe it for you is

1598
01:53:09.06 --> 01:53:14.42
imagine when you're underwater and you can't breathe, you should know very well. Do.

1599
01:53:14.42 --> 01:53:21.70
What will you do to get to the top to get a breath and whatever it takes? Yeah. Right. And that's

1600
01:53:21.70 --> 01:53:27.94
what anxiety is. Like if you can't get rid of it, you'll get to the point to where you're like,

1601
01:53:28.74 --> 01:53:35.14
if I have to end it, for anxiety to get rid of this feeling, I will do that. And that was the

1602
01:53:35.14 --> 01:53:43.06
point. That was the only thing that got me there. And so I went down there, the other guy I'm talking

1603
01:53:43.06 --> 01:53:46.18
about when I went to his name, but he was struggling to and let me tell you something. He's one of the

1604
01:53:46.18 --> 01:53:50.98
hardest dudes I know. My team leader, you know, and this was about a year after my team leader,

1605
01:53:52.82 --> 01:53:57.94
who was a Marine sniper took me through, got me to become a Marine sniper, went down a rack with

1606
01:53:57.94 --> 01:54:01.06
him deployed with him, then he went over it, got out of the Marine Corps and said, forget it,

1607
01:54:01.06 --> 01:54:07.70
I'm going to go be a Navy seal, became a Navy seal, deployed with the Navy seals, team out in

1608
01:54:07.70 --> 01:54:14.74
Hawaii and in one day you said, I'm done and put it, put it, put it to gun to his mouth and kill

1609
01:54:14.74 --> 01:54:21.86
himself. Another hard guy, no. And so, you know, when people call these guys cowards,

1610
01:54:25.46 --> 01:54:33.06
they're not cowards. They're not cowards. These are some of the hardest man that have ever

1611
01:54:33.06 --> 01:54:39.54
walked the face to planet. And that's why you know, you have to take it serious. And so anyway,

1612
01:54:39.54 --> 01:54:46.98
this guy, he went down there, I get down there and you have to sign like paperwork that says,

1613
01:54:47.54 --> 01:54:53.06
you may experience that you're dying. I mean, it's one of the scariest things that I've ever done.

1614
01:54:53.62 --> 01:54:59.38
And after you take it, there's no, you ride it to the law frame. There's no off-rim.

1615
01:54:59.38 --> 01:55:06.42
And so I took this out, so you go there and there's like, you didn't eat all day on a Friday.

1616
01:55:06.42 --> 01:55:13.62
I took the Ibogaine at 8 p.m. on a Friday. And now you're talking about, they were like doing

1617
01:55:13.62 --> 01:55:18.66
this sage stuff, like hippie stuff. And I'm like, you guys are hippies. I don't, I don't mean that.

1618
01:55:18.66 --> 01:55:23.30
Like, I'm nothing against hippies, but I'm just not one, right? I don't know, I can't get into this,

1619
01:55:23.30 --> 01:55:30.26
you know, waving this stuff around or whatever. And believe whatever you want again, but like,

1620
01:55:30.26 --> 01:55:37.62
I couldn't, I couldn't get into the mood. And so I'm like, I take it and you have to write down

1621
01:55:37.62 --> 01:55:46.18
your intentions on this piece of paper. And I just wrote that I just wanted to some relief.

1622
01:55:46.18 --> 01:55:53.46
I wanted some, I just wanted some relief, whatever. So you go up and you lay down this room,

1623
01:55:54.50 --> 01:56:00.90
you lay on this, the bed, it's beds on the floor. And you put these blindfolds over.

1624
01:56:00.90 --> 01:56:04.66
And I didn't feel anything for a minute. When you take it, what is that like a drink?

1625
01:56:04.66 --> 01:56:12.42
It's like, like, peel, measure it out, so you take it, you know, in, you and I talked a little bit

1626
01:56:12.42 --> 01:56:18.26
before you came out here. And I knew about some of these things that you were trying. And I don't

1627
01:56:18.26 --> 01:56:25.46
know about these things. Yeah. And one of my friends, Tim Ferriss, is like, just to say, like,

1628
01:56:25.46 --> 01:56:31.62
when you're like, oh, this hippie stuff, that's kind of the way I think, too, right? And, and

1629
01:56:33.38 --> 01:56:39.14
I like want to understand it better because I know it helped you. Look, even, even Rogan.

1630
01:56:39.14 --> 01:56:45.62
He told me he's like, I think it will help. I think it will help Dakota. And you and I went back and

1631
01:56:45.62 --> 01:56:50.98
forth. I was like, hey, man, I'm going to ask Joe. And I said, hey, Joe, what do you think? And at that point,

1632
01:56:50.98 --> 01:56:58.42
he'd met you and he'd been on his podcast. And he was like, that was actually, you actually texted me.

1633
01:56:58.42 --> 01:57:02.18
I did it. You were like, hey, what, this is what I'm coming to San Diego for. What do you think?

1634
01:57:02.18 --> 01:57:07.14
And I was like, dude, I don't freaking know. Let me ask Rogan. So I asked him. And of course,

1635
01:57:07.14 --> 01:57:14.18
what is he's. But he wasn't. I mean, as much as Rogan is is understands this stuff. And he's for it.

1636
01:57:14.18 --> 01:57:19.78
He was also like, he laid out reasons. Yeah, I'll text him and ask him a question about something.

1637
01:57:19.78 --> 01:57:24.02
And he'll be like, no, don't know. That is not going to help. If you're trying for this,

1638
01:57:24.02 --> 01:57:29.30
he's like, nope, that won't help you. So, so that's one part of it. Like, Rogan has that level of

1639
01:57:29.30 --> 01:57:37.38
understanding. And then on the other side, Tim Ferriss is trying to get this stuff approved medically

1640
01:57:37.38 --> 01:57:41.70
and trying to get support there. And so I just asked him to give me a rundown of like, hey,

1641
01:57:41.70 --> 01:57:47.22
what is all this stuff? You know, it's not just hippie stuff. And he's like, no, it's not just hippie stuff.

1642
01:57:47.22 --> 01:57:51.70
And here's what it is. And like, he said, I began because he, he was kind of talking me through this.

1643
01:57:51.70 --> 01:57:58.82
I began from some shrub in Africa. And he said, it's like the most powerful. There is.

1644
01:57:58.82 --> 01:58:04.18
Right. He said a lot of seals do it because seals are like, you know, all right, what I'm going hard.

1645
01:58:04.18 --> 01:58:12.82
Yeah. What do you got? And so, so that's what I became is. I began is it's a lot of times

1646
01:58:12.82 --> 01:58:19.46
they use it for opioid addiction. So yeah, but like, it's so it's so hardcore that they put these

1647
01:58:19.46 --> 01:58:24.66
people on it for opioid addiction. And it kicks their ass to where they don't do opioids again.

1648
01:58:24.66 --> 01:58:33.14
All right. So back to your story. So you take the thing, they're waving, they're waving hippies stuff for

1649
01:58:33.14 --> 01:58:40.74
around. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I just, I couldn't, and I like, they laughed at me the

1650
01:58:40.74 --> 01:58:45.38
whole time, right? They're like, I'm like, yeah, whatever. I can't get it. Are these Americans that are

1651
01:58:45.38 --> 01:58:50.58
down there? Are they? So there was like, yeah, all of them were except for two. Okay.

1652
01:58:50.58 --> 01:58:58.66
And so we're there in this house. And then there's a bunch of, there's a bunch of seals there.

1653
01:58:59.54 --> 01:59:07.86
I like that are, make sure we, nothing, nobody comes in that are there to help you.

1654
01:59:09.14 --> 01:59:12.42
If you need something, but like, all I'm going to tell you, all I'm going to say is,

1655
01:59:12.42 --> 01:59:19.14
is like, I was surrounded by seals. And so that tells me, like, hey, like seals are no bullshit.

1656
01:59:19.14 --> 01:59:27.78
Like, you know what I mean? Like, and that's, yeah. So I took it and all the sudden, like,

1657
01:59:28.10 --> 01:59:38.66
I feel it starting to come. Like, it's like, it was like this spinning. And, and you were just like,

1658
01:59:38.66 --> 01:59:44.34
it was like, it was like, all, it's like I was watching my life on a TV screen. And I didn't see anything

1659
01:59:44.34 --> 01:59:53.46
from more. And I was walking through this town and everything looked gloomy. And I, I, I, I, I

1660
01:59:53.46 --> 01:59:58.66
never forget I went into this one room. And I went in this room. And I, I, I seen like all these

1661
01:59:58.66 --> 02:00:10.10
people, like, this huge crowd. And, but I felt like just disappointment. And, um, and I got,

1662
02:00:10.10 --> 02:00:14.90
I did my typical me of wanting to fix it. Like, what did I do wrong? Like, how can I fix this?

1663
02:00:14.90 --> 02:00:19.62
And I kept running up to all of them. And then it would be like flashing up people that I knew

1664
02:00:21.30 --> 02:00:29.14
and people that like, I knew I hadn't done anything to, but just did it for manipulation.

1665
02:00:30.18 --> 02:00:35.70
And like, there were just flashing on and on. And finally, I'm just like, what did I do wrong? And,

1666
02:00:35.70 --> 02:00:40.02
like, I just remember feeling this like this feeling of just defeat. And I was in there

1667
02:00:40.02 --> 02:00:45.86
for probably four hours. And then I came out and I was walking down the town. Like, I would look

1668
02:00:45.86 --> 02:00:51.62
at every little gauge. And it would be like, uh, the gauge would instead, like it would fill up.

1669
02:00:51.62 --> 02:00:56.10
And instead of being at full, it would say finished. And it would be like this far from finished.

1670
02:00:56.10 --> 02:01:00.98
And I never finished anything. And then I would see this beautiful ball light. And I would go to it.

1671
02:01:00.98 --> 02:01:09.70
And it would be my two daughters playing. And, um, this went on until three p.m. on Saturday

1672
02:01:09.70 --> 02:01:21.14
afternoon. And I never forget there was at one point of it. And I, uh, like, I was just, like,

1673
02:01:21.14 --> 02:01:29.78
I just felt like I was such a trash that I was falling just like, I just, I don't care anymore.

1674
02:01:30.50 --> 02:01:36.90
Like, my ego, it took my ego and just smashed it. And it's like, I don't care when anybody thinks,

1675
02:01:36.90 --> 02:01:44.10
I don't care. I know I wake up and I, I'm the best man. I know I get my best. I'm not perfect. I know

1676
02:01:44.10 --> 02:01:49.38
that I know that I don't come off and say the right things. But I know what my antenna is.

1677
02:01:50.42 --> 02:01:55.78
I know there's, you couldn't look at me and make me question my intent. Like, you can definitely

1678
02:01:55.78 --> 02:02:02.58
question my delivery. You can criticize how I come off or how I do this or, but my intent is there.

1679
02:02:02.58 --> 02:02:08.18
And my intent is good. And I'm never forget like that, it broke everything. It's like,

1680
02:02:08.18 --> 02:02:12.50
got to the point where I got in care anymore. And like, I'm never forget that I was laying there. And I was like,

1681
02:02:13.54 --> 02:02:21.86
just, I'd like, if this is odd, I, this is odd, I. And, um, I just didn't care anymore. I didn't care

1682
02:02:21.86 --> 02:02:27.30
what my mom thought of me. I didn't care what, you know, all these people that I had, I had invested in.

1683
02:02:27.30 --> 02:02:32.42
And I had gave them these titles, which when you give somebody titles, you give them a thought,

1684
02:02:32.42 --> 02:02:44.10
you know, you're not going to tell me what my intent is. And so I come out of it. I was so pissed off.

1685
02:02:44.82 --> 02:02:50.02
When I came out of it, like I literally looked at the doctor and I said, this is what you brought me here for.

1686
02:02:50.74 --> 02:02:56.02
I said, I called up the guy who sent me there who's a close friend. I said, this is

1687
02:02:56.02 --> 02:03:01.14
100% bullshit. Like I was so down, like out, because my biggest fear was opening Pandora's box.

1688
02:03:02.50 --> 02:03:08.02
And, um, he's like, wait till the next day. So the next day you do this, this five

1689
02:03:08.02 --> 02:03:14.50
MEODMT. And, um, I never forget like, I, I, I, I, I wanted to make sure I seen the world the same. So I'm

1690
02:03:14.50 --> 02:03:18.82
looking out this window in Mexico. And we're looking out. We're right by the ocean. I look out.

1691
02:03:18.82 --> 02:03:22.58
And all I can see is it's not all I can think of my head is man. This place is a shittle.

1692
02:03:22.58 --> 02:03:29.22
That's all I can think. I go down to do this DMT and I, I laid down and as soon as you go, like,

1693
02:03:29.22 --> 02:03:34.18
it's almost like it, it was like feet first. Like I was like gone, like to a tube, right?

1694
02:03:36.10 --> 02:03:42.02
And, um, and it feels real. Or do you know that you're like, no, you know you're tripping.

1695
02:03:42.02 --> 02:03:47.54
You don't see a thing. No, you, you know, I mean, you know, it's, it's not like it's a physical thing.

1696
02:03:47.54 --> 02:03:53.14
Like when you drink you physically feel drunk. It's like your salt. Like it's, it's not a,

1697
02:03:53.86 --> 02:04:01.78
it's not a physical reaction. It's like your soul. And, um, I was, it was gone. And like,

1698
02:04:01.78 --> 02:04:04.90
you can't see anything. It was pure white. It was the most beautiful white

1699
02:04:04.90 --> 02:04:10.02
that I've ever seen in my life. It was, there's no, there's no word in English dictionary to

1700
02:04:10.02 --> 02:04:17.46
ever describe how beautiful the white was. And all I could feel was love. Like I felt good.

1701
02:04:17.46 --> 02:04:22.82
I felt like you could feel what good is. Like if you took how I feel when my daughters

1702
02:04:22.82 --> 02:04:27.94
give me a hug or that that unconditional love, like that's what the whole place felt like.

1703
02:04:28.74 --> 02:04:33.22
It was like the perfect temperature. I didn't think about anything else.

1704
02:04:37.38 --> 02:04:40.58
And all I heard were my teammates say that it was all right.

1705
02:04:40.58 --> 02:04:51.46
And, um, yeah, it was like, it was like everything bad was gone. It was like, I got

1706
02:04:51.46 --> 02:04:59.46
to like a reset in my life. And, uh, when I came back to, I set up. And I just like, I started crying.

1707
02:04:59.46 --> 02:05:04.02
And I looked at these, these two women who were there, these two nurses. And I just couldn't

1708
02:05:04.02 --> 02:05:11.54
believe that like there were such, there were like, I had to like, I'm in Mexico and there's

1709
02:05:11.54 --> 02:05:20.02
two people who genuinely care about me. And, uh, I care about me enough to, to help me through this.

1710
02:05:20.02 --> 02:05:23.22
And I looked out the window and I was like, gosh, this is the most beautiful place I've ever

1711
02:05:23.22 --> 02:05:33.22
been. And I didn't have any anxiety after that. I went back home. The stuff that like would send

1712
02:05:33.22 --> 02:05:40.18
me over the edge. Man, I was just happy to be alive. How long has this, I woke up every, like I

1713
02:05:40.90 --> 02:05:53.86
still, I mean, still, I get up. And do I have bad days? Yeah, but, but like, I'm just happy to be here.

1714
02:05:53.86 --> 02:06:03.14
You know, like, like, you know, I, I just changed my whole life. Like, I, I came back in my anxiety

1715
02:06:03.14 --> 02:06:12.42
was, I mean, I get normal. There is normal anxiety. But like that, those anxiety tax, I haven't had

1716
02:06:12.42 --> 02:06:19.38
one sense. How long has it been? It'll be two years this November.

1717
02:06:24.26 --> 02:06:30.58
You know, the thing that you said about intent is something that I, I, I talk about a lot from a,

1718
02:06:30.58 --> 02:06:36.02
from a leadership perspective and that bleed over into life because I think if you're doing the

1719
02:06:36.02 --> 02:06:43.46
right things for the right reasons, if your intent is good, you're going to be okay. Right? If you're

1720
02:06:43.46 --> 02:06:48.66
not trying to screw somebody over for not trying to maneuver, for not trying to sneak one by somebody,

1721
02:06:48.66 --> 02:06:52.18
if you're not trying to look out for your own agenda, like the military, it's a classic example.

1722
02:06:52.18 --> 02:06:57.78
You get an officer or a senior enlisted leader that what their intent is to get themselves promoted,

1723
02:06:57.78 --> 02:07:03.94
or what their intent is to get themselves at freaking a war or credit or accolades. If that's what

1724
02:07:03.94 --> 02:07:07.54
their intent is, everybody can see it. And it doesn't work out good for them in the end.

1725
02:07:09.14 --> 02:07:12.42
If their intent is good, that they want to get the mission done that they want to take care of

1726
02:07:12.42 --> 02:07:16.42
their team, that they want to, that they're putting themselves below their team and lifting their

1727
02:07:16.42 --> 02:07:22.42
team up. Like, that intent is what, what makes a good leader, what makes a good person.

1728
02:07:22.42 --> 02:07:28.18
And I think when people have bad intent, it eats them apart, it eats them up.

1729
02:07:28.90 --> 02:07:32.10
And they can, they can have bad intent. You can cover it up. You can try and drown it out. You can

1730
02:07:32.10 --> 02:07:37.46
pretend that it's not there, but it's there. And what I tell people is like intent, you can smell

1731
02:07:37.46 --> 02:07:43.78
people's intent. And the worst part about it is you can smell your own intent. You can. And if you have

1732
02:07:43.78 --> 02:07:50.66
bad intent, you have to sit in that rod and stink yourself. And it will, you apart. You can put

1733
02:07:50.66 --> 02:07:55.22
a perfume all over it. You can put the odor in all over it. It's still there. And you know it.

1734
02:07:56.26 --> 02:08:06.82
So that's like a realization that you had of my intent is good. Yeah, like, like, look,

1735
02:08:07.86 --> 02:08:17.94
your intent is, is your foundation of your house. Your priorities are basically the, the shell

1736
02:08:17.94 --> 02:08:28.18
of your house. They can change. You can move rooms. You can adjust on it. Right. But if you're intent,

1737
02:08:29.86 --> 02:08:37.46
you know, if your intent is is is wrong, that house is not going to stand. You can't keep building

1738
02:08:37.46 --> 02:08:41.86
on that house. You can't keep adding on to it. You can't keep making it better. The foundation

1739
02:08:41.86 --> 02:08:49.70
is done. It's done. And the only difference between murder and self defense is intent. And

1740
02:08:51.14 --> 02:08:58.50
nobody can question that. No, it, it is what it is. It's, it's black and white. It is,

1741
02:08:58.50 --> 02:09:07.30
it is an, your intent is absolute. And that's ultimately, when you start digging down the root of this

1742
02:09:07.30 --> 02:09:13.38
tree, that's ultimately what's going to decide if you're going to hold up in the bad times or not.

1743
02:09:13.38 --> 02:09:19.38
Yeah, the, the thing is, I don't know if, you, I don't know if I caught exactly what you said,

1744
02:09:19.38 --> 02:09:28.34
but I've seen people change their intent in their life. 100%. Okay. So I, I, I, I thought you said,

1745
02:09:28.34 --> 02:09:31.78
like, oh, you can't change your intent. You can't change your intent of something that happened in the past.

1746
02:09:31.78 --> 02:09:38.34
But if you've been running around looking out for yourself and stepping on people's backs and that's the

1747
02:09:38.34 --> 02:09:45.06
way you roll, you can change that. You can actually begin to act like a good person. Yeah, but

1748
02:09:45.06 --> 02:09:52.42
here's what I'll tell you is, is you can't be both. That is true. You can't, you can't, you can't,

1749
02:09:53.94 --> 02:10:01.14
you can't be selfish and selfless. You're either one of the other. And there is no

1750
02:10:01.14 --> 02:10:06.90
why I'm selfish at these times, but I'm selfless at these times. No, no, no, because then when you're

1751
02:10:06.90 --> 02:10:12.18
selfless, you're only being selfless when you want to be selfless and that's selfish. Yeah, right?

1752
02:10:12.18 --> 02:10:17.38
Like there's no being both in this life. Like you don't get to, you don't get to skirt the line.

1753
02:10:17.38 --> 02:10:22.74
You're either all in on one of the other. And it's obvious. And there's no,

1754
02:10:22.74 --> 02:10:30.98
there's no, there's no, there's no ex, there's no excuse for that. It is what it is.

1755
02:10:30.98 --> 02:10:35.14
And you know it. And you know it on everything you do. You ultimately know it.

1756
02:10:36.02 --> 02:10:44.90
Is it like a one time thing? I just, I've done it once. And then, you know, the only thing I'll do now

1757
02:10:44.90 --> 02:10:51.86
is like a, like how you're still a sideband. If I, if I start feeling anxiety come around, right? Like,

1758
02:10:53.70 --> 02:10:59.06
I'll, I'll just do a dose of still a sideband. Okay. So, so a sideband is mushroom. Mushrooms. Yeah.

1759
02:11:00.26 --> 02:11:06.90
And, and then when you say you feel it coming, it's just like, hey, tomorrow, like I feel like I'm

1760
02:11:06.90 --> 02:11:12.34
nervous about tomorrow or is it like, hey, I'm starting to feel nervous right now. Now I start like,

1761
02:11:12.34 --> 02:11:17.54
like, you know, like I came home from that I would gain experience and like, I got to see the world

1762
02:11:17.54 --> 02:11:24.34
and a place that I've never seen it. Like I got to see like with a relief that I had never felt,

1763
02:11:24.34 --> 02:11:34.02
I didn't know that people could really walk around like this. And, you know, I, I mean, you got to take,

1764
02:11:34.02 --> 02:11:40.82
I grew up in chaos. I mean, the only, a lot of times, you know, my, my biggest thing is

1765
02:11:40.82 --> 02:11:48.42
is, is not like people talk about being in like the, the dark places. Why I'm comfortable there?

1766
02:11:49.54 --> 02:11:54.10
The problem I have is is being in the light where there's not dark places. You know,

1767
02:11:54.10 --> 02:11:58.18
I have the problem of being when there's no chaos. You want to talk about where I'm the best

1768
02:11:58.82 --> 02:12:04.34
is, is you put me in the most chaotic environment and it needs to get figured out. Like,

1769
02:12:04.34 --> 02:12:11.70
and the stakes are high? Well, that's, that's where I'm good. The problem I'm trying to learn is how to be okay

1770
02:12:12.82 --> 02:12:17.94
when it's not chaotic. And that's what I have to, that's what I have to work on.

1771
02:12:19.38 --> 02:12:25.14
How often do you feel like that anxiety is coming and you go like, like, how often do you feel like,

1772
02:12:25.14 --> 02:12:29.54
oh, I better get a little bit of a little bit of a suicide and help me get through this.

1773
02:12:29.54 --> 02:12:40.10
You know, once a quarter, one, like, so I'm just me personally. Like, I, I don't think,

1774
02:12:40.10 --> 02:12:46.26
like, I don't, I don't know how to do this stuff. Do I look at as a recreational type of thing? Like, I don't,

1775
02:12:46.26 --> 02:12:54.10
I don't think, I think if, if you're using it as a medicinal piece as a, not as a medicinal,

1776
02:12:54.10 --> 02:12:58.18
of I'm going to do it every night, if I go to bed, you know what I mean? I can't, if you're using it to,

1777
02:13:00.02 --> 02:13:04.26
because it's something you need. Nobody questioned somebody who takes blood pressure medicine.

1778
02:13:05.14 --> 02:13:12.74
You know what I mean? Like, so, you know, for me about once a quarter, you know, and I'll do, like,

1779
02:13:12.74 --> 02:13:24.42
I'll do a big dose, like, like, like a six or six or seven grams of psilocybin and

1780
02:13:25.14 --> 02:13:30.58
then like, how, I'm good. It's like five hours and then I'm good.

1781
02:13:33.54 --> 02:13:40.10
So before we wrap up this little section on, uh, this is, this is, this is,

1782
02:13:40.10 --> 02:13:46.10
like I said, I talked to Tim and, and he just gave me a bunch of really good information,

1783
02:13:46.10 --> 02:13:51.14
because I don't understand this stuff. I don't know about it. I've never done it before,

1784
02:13:52.02 --> 02:13:58.02
and, but I've talked to so many of my friends that have had that it's helped them so much,

1785
02:13:58.02 --> 02:14:02.42
you included, that I want, you know, I have an open mind. I want to understand it better.

1786
02:14:03.22 --> 02:14:07.54
Um, you know, a couple of things that he said actually, there's a few things that he said,

1787
02:14:07.54 --> 02:14:12.42
number one, like, because the veteran community has gone through such traumatic experiences,

1788
02:14:13.22 --> 02:14:21.54
that's the main group to, to need this type of treatment. The other one is is survivors or victims

1789
02:14:21.54 --> 02:14:25.86
of traumatic assaults, whether that's sexual assaults or physical assaults, but people that have been

1790
02:14:25.86 --> 02:14:32.74
through that. So it's, but, but there's no federal funding for it. So there's no federal funding for it,

1791
02:14:32.74 --> 02:14:38.02
which means there's no, there's, there's not enough money. It's just people that are donating,

1792
02:14:38.02 --> 02:14:47.54
donating money to try and try and help get funding for more research. Um, the thing about

1793
02:14:47.54 --> 02:14:53.70
specifically, he said about mushrooms, they've been used for thousands of years, right? So mushrooms

1794
02:14:53.70 --> 02:15:00.50
have been used for thousands of years, um, and, and he also said, and this was interesting to me,

1795
02:15:00.50 --> 02:15:07.14
like, there's no, you don't need, you don't want to do more. No, he said, you do something,

1796
02:15:07.14 --> 02:15:12.58
and you're like, okay, I don't want to do more. It's not, it's not like heroin or cocaine,

1797
02:15:12.58 --> 02:15:16.10
where we need to do cocaine apparently, because I've never done it, but apparently, when you do it,

1798
02:15:16.10 --> 02:15:20.98
you just want to do more. When you do either I had a neighbor that had gotten out of prison and

1799
02:15:20.98 --> 02:15:26.10
moved in with his uncle, and he was, he was out of prison after seven years, and he, um,

1800
02:15:26.10 --> 02:15:33.06
he was on meth, and he said the first, he said, hey, the first time I did crystal meth,

1801
02:15:33.62 --> 02:15:39.86
it was the only thing I ever wanted to do for the rest of my life. Yeah, so, and he went right

1802
02:15:39.86 --> 02:15:43.70
down that path and stole from everybody that knew and freaking wrecked his life and ended up in jail.

1803
02:15:44.58 --> 02:15:49.14
But, you know, what Tim was saying is like, there's, there's like an anti-addictive,

1804
02:15:49.14 --> 02:15:57.14
like, um, because you can't, you don't want to do it every day. No, I mean, like, I couldn't

1805
02:15:57.14 --> 02:16:00.42
imagine if you thought you were going to go out and party and somebody gave you a thing of

1806
02:16:00.42 --> 02:16:06.34
eye-bogaine. You know what I mean? Like, like, like, like, like, I couldn't imagine if you thought

1807
02:16:06.34 --> 02:16:11.94
you were going to go out and party and you took, you know, six to eight grams of still siren,

1808
02:16:11.94 --> 02:16:17.46
like, for me personally, maybe I'm weak, but I, I just, I couldn't imagine and like, there's

1809
02:16:17.46 --> 02:16:25.46
nothing about it. Like, it's like, work. Like, if I'm taking this, like, I know I'm going in to do some

1810
02:16:25.46 --> 02:16:32.18
work. The, um, the way he was describing it to me and he certainly talked about the tattoo,

1811
02:16:32.18 --> 02:16:35.22
you know, we're about leadership strategy and talking about detachment. He's like, oh yeah,

1812
02:16:35.22 --> 02:16:43.30
here's what it is. He goes, uh, mushrooms, civil siren is like, it is your brain can detach and look

1813
02:16:43.30 --> 02:16:48.18
at what is going on and then you can find a solution for it. And you just made a face like, yes,

1814
02:16:48.18 --> 02:16:54.98
it's clarity. And I get off like, I come off of it and I can thank clear, then I've ever been able to

1815
02:16:54.98 --> 02:17:02.58
think. He, he said, you know, I begin definitely got to be careful. He said there's cardiac risk,

1816
02:17:02.58 --> 02:17:08.42
like you can have some significant problems from that, um, whereas mushrooms, he, he said,

1817
02:17:08.42 --> 02:17:12.50
basically, I don't think there's any, like, reported ODs on mushrooms. You would have to do

1818
02:17:12.50 --> 02:17:18.58
pounds of it. And there's no way he can do pounds of mushrooms. He also said that,

1819
02:17:20.26 --> 02:17:24.74
he said, look, there's a whole warning thing, right? There's a whole, like, warning thing that you

1820
02:17:24.74 --> 02:17:30.74
need to watch out for, uh, specifically if you've had schizophrenia in your family, it's like a

1821
02:17:30.74 --> 02:17:36.26
big red flag. It's probably no go. They don't, when, when they're testing it, they don't test it on

1822
02:17:36.26 --> 02:17:47.62
people that that have had those types of problems before. But, um, like you said, like, it's like

1823
02:17:47.62 --> 02:17:51.78
these, these things are one to two, maybe three sessions and you don't need it anymore.

1824
02:17:52.82 --> 02:17:58.10
So some of the other warnings look, there's legal, like there's, it's illegal. Yes, it's illegal.

1825
02:17:58.10 --> 02:18:03.30
It's illegal. So you can't do it. You're not allowed to do it. You're not allowed to do it.

1826
02:18:03.30 --> 02:18:08.98
Mm-hmm. Um, and if you get caught with it, you, you'll go jail. You go, you go to jail.

1827
02:18:09.94 --> 02:18:16.82
So that's, that's number one, right? The other thing that Tim said is like,

1828
02:18:18.58 --> 02:18:23.22
you've got a, for him, he's like, if somebody asked me about it, he says, here's the protocol.

1829
02:18:24.26 --> 02:18:28.42
You, you know, a month of preparation. And the preparation that he's put on people is like,

1830
02:18:28.42 --> 02:18:34.18
hey, you got to meditate every day. You got to, he's got some books to read. Um, you got to do that.

1831
02:18:34.18 --> 02:18:38.26
He said, you got to look at it like, if you're getting knee surgery. If you're an athlete and

1832
02:18:38.26 --> 02:18:42.58
getting knee surgery, what do you do? You go out. You research. You find the best doctor. You do the,

1833
02:18:42.58 --> 02:18:46.42
there's prep work to get ready to have surgery. You got to like work out a certain way and do

1834
02:18:46.42 --> 02:18:50.18
certain exercise to get ready. Then once you get the surgery done, you got to go into,

1835
02:18:50.18 --> 02:18:54.98
you got to rehab and you, and it's what you said earlier, like, you got to do the work.

1836
02:18:54.98 --> 02:18:59.86
You, you got to do the work. And like, if you're not willing to put in that work on the front end,

1837
02:19:01.14 --> 02:19:06.58
you don't respect it enough to do it. You don't have, you don't want to get better. You don't

1838
02:19:06.58 --> 02:19:11.70
want to use it for the intent that it needs to be used for, right? Like all these things,

1839
02:19:11.70 --> 02:19:18.18
I take it very serious. Like, I don't, let me tell you something. Like, I, I mean, it's even

1840
02:19:18.18 --> 02:19:22.98
hard for me to talk about like honestly, like, it just upfront. Like it's hard for me to even talk

1841
02:19:22.98 --> 02:19:30.66
about in this room because it's like, this is something that I, in this room, a year ago, two years ago,

1842
02:19:30.66 --> 02:19:37.38
would have looked at like, what are you doing? Right? And it's hard to bring that up around people

1843
02:19:37.38 --> 02:19:43.94
that I know and trust because if they haven't, it's one of those things that if you haven't done it,

1844
02:19:43.94 --> 02:19:50.10
but then I start thinking to myself, why can I drink alcohol? You know what I mean? Why,

1845
02:19:50.10 --> 02:19:56.34
why can I do all these other things that somebody has allowed me to do? I could go to the VA right now

1846
02:19:56.34 --> 02:20:03.54
and get prescribed clotapin. I could get Xanx's. I could be out of my mind on all these pharmaceuticals

1847
02:20:03.54 --> 02:20:12.34
and that's acceptable in our society and addictive and addictive and bad for you. But this,

1848
02:20:13.54 --> 02:20:18.98
this is even if I have to think about this, even if I have to go through my life. Let's say I do this

1849
02:20:18.98 --> 02:20:28.10
once a quarter, the rest of my life. For five hours, once a quarter. Really? People go to bars.

1850
02:20:28.10 --> 02:20:36.50
They spend more than that in a bar drinking alcohol on the weekends. Well, for me,

1851
02:20:37.06 --> 02:20:40.98
like I said, I've got you and when you got, I actually like I'm like, how was it, man?

1852
02:20:40.98 --> 02:20:47.14
I mean, how was it? And you were like, I feel freaking awesome now and I was like, okay,

1853
02:20:47.14 --> 02:20:53.62
I mean, like if my friend can escape this pain and this suffering that you're in,

1854
02:20:53.62 --> 02:20:59.54
like I want at least other people know about it and listen, there's like, there's all kinds of

1855
02:20:59.54 --> 02:21:03.94
things you need to think about. It's preparation. It's making sure you understand it. It's

1856
02:21:03.94 --> 02:21:09.46
finding the best doctor the right place. It's, it's also having a safety net in place before you do it

1857
02:21:09.46 --> 02:21:14.34
because because it can't uncover things that you didn't think we're going to come. You didn't think

1858
02:21:14.34 --> 02:21:18.98
this was coming and guess what, you get hit with it and it will. You get ambushed. So you better have

1859
02:21:18.98 --> 02:21:23.06
some backup. You better have some safety net. You have to assume that you're going to need help when

1860
02:21:23.06 --> 02:21:31.30
you're done with it. Getting the right environment, Tim said, take less than you think you can handle.

1861
02:21:31.30 --> 02:21:38.74
Everyone's like, oh, I'm just going in hard. Like, dumb move. Yeah, dumb move. He did also mentioned

1862
02:21:38.74 --> 02:21:47.86
a couple places where there's John Hopkins University, John Hopkins University is doing all kinds

1863
02:21:47.86 --> 02:21:51.86
of experimentation to try and figure out how to use it properly. There's a bunch of other places

1864
02:21:51.86 --> 02:21:59.30
that are doing it as well. There's something called maps.org, map.org, maps.org, which is the

1865
02:21:59.30 --> 02:22:05.38
multi-disciplinary association for psychedelic studies. That's it. That's, this is if you want to

1866
02:22:05.38 --> 02:22:11.46
support what we're talking about. If you want to try and get it, so it's not underground. Right?

1867
02:22:11.46 --> 02:22:15.62
Because if you can go get prescribed X and whatever other things that you're talking about, or you can

1868
02:22:15.62 --> 02:22:20.42
just go down to the freaking corner store and buy a bottle of whiskey and a knee-brie at yourself,

1869
02:22:21.06 --> 02:22:25.54
which all it does is cover up the problems, numbs the problems. If you would like to say,

1870
02:22:25.54 --> 02:22:30.82
hey, maybe we should take a different approach, you can go to maps.org, you can go to

1871
02:22:30.82 --> 02:22:46.10
usesonainstitute.org. It's just another, it's USO N-A-I-N-S-T-I-T-U-T-E.org. To try to donate or whatever,

1872
02:22:46.10 --> 02:22:49.78
you can support there and then just universities that are out there that are doing this.

1873
02:22:51.38 --> 02:22:56.10
He told me a couple documentaries that will help you have better understanding one of them's

1874
02:22:56.10 --> 02:23:04.10
called Trip of Compassion and apparently it's super intense. Apparently they show this therapy

1875
02:23:04.10 --> 02:23:15.62
taking place and it's like really intense. And the other one is called Fantastic Fungi. Let me say that

1876
02:23:15.62 --> 02:23:20.90
right? Fungi. Fungi. Fungi. Fungi. Which is kind of a Alice kind of like, oh, that's kind of,

1877
02:23:20.90 --> 02:23:25.54
it sounds like whatever, almost a comedic right name and then he told me what it's about and

1878
02:23:25.54 --> 02:23:32.82
what it's about is they've got people that are have some kind of terminal disease. In many cases

1879
02:23:32.82 --> 02:23:38.42
older people, but people that are people like you what, what we're talking about where people that

1880
02:23:38.42 --> 02:23:42.50
would never think about doing anything like this in their lives and they haven't for 40, 60,

1881
02:23:42.50 --> 02:23:54.18
80 years and they're doing these drugs in order to overcome or be comfortable as they face death.

1882
02:23:54.18 --> 02:23:59.46
Yeah. And something like he says that there's like grandmalls on there that you know never

1883
02:23:59.46 --> 02:24:04.58
drank in their life and they're on there saying this is the best thing that I've ever done. So

1884
02:24:05.86 --> 02:24:13.62
definitely some look this again. I'm I'm no pro do research, but it's something that we

1885
02:24:14.26 --> 02:24:20.18
need to start talking about because if it can help us out, if it's been helping people for

1886
02:24:20.18 --> 02:24:24.02
a long time anyways, you know, with the case of mushrooms been helping for thousands of years,

1887
02:24:24.66 --> 02:24:30.02
if there's something, if there's a way to help people, let's freaking research it, let's find out

1888
02:24:30.02 --> 02:24:36.02
how to do it right and let's let's get people to a situation where they can do it legally,

1889
02:24:36.02 --> 02:24:43.78
but again doing it with the right intent. Yeah, with the right intent. And I'm telling you,

1890
02:24:43.78 --> 02:24:52.34
drinking is way easier than going in and facing and working through what you see with this.

1891
02:24:52.34 --> 02:24:59.38
Drinking is easier going and you know running away from your problems is way easier. This is a

1892
02:25:00.42 --> 02:25:05.06
this is where it's going to it's going to look you in the eyes and you're going to if you want to

1893
02:25:05.06 --> 02:25:09.62
work on it, you'll work on it. I mean, and it's so hard. It sounds like even me talking about it.

1894
02:25:09.62 --> 02:25:15.30
It sounds so crazy. Just even talking about it like that. But it's really like for example,

1895
02:25:15.94 --> 02:25:20.10
the last time I did it. I mean, I I I I I sit there and looked at my teammates dead,

1896
02:25:21.54 --> 02:25:28.18
but you know what I looked at it and I waited. I was okay with it. I came out of it and I was okay

1897
02:25:28.18 --> 02:25:33.14
with it. Yeah, did I still feel the hurt? Yeah, there was I said I got to see my grandparents,

1898
02:25:33.14 --> 02:25:43.86
which I loved more than anything. But I was okay with it. Yeah, it's okay to it's a normal reaction

1899
02:25:43.86 --> 02:25:51.30
to to hurt from it to miss them, but it's not normal to let these actions dictate the rest of your life.

1900
02:25:51.30 --> 02:25:55.70
And that was where it did it gave me the perspective of seeing it again on my terms.

1901
02:25:55.70 --> 02:26:00.90
And it and hopefully with that did is it processed it now. It's out, check.

1902
02:26:05.14 --> 02:26:13.62
Proceed with caution with caution with caution. Let's talk about something that's a little less

1903
02:26:15.38 --> 02:26:21.94
controversial, but also provides a massive amount of healing in my humble opinion. A little something

1904
02:26:21.94 --> 02:26:28.82
called jujitsu. How's the jujitsu coming along, man? You know, I haven't I haven't rolled much lately.

1905
02:26:30.02 --> 02:26:35.22
I was rolling quite a bit whenever all the the COVID hit right now. Everything got shut down.

1906
02:26:37.38 --> 02:26:44.02
I feel like I'll probably be a white belt for life. We're all white belts for life.

1907
02:26:44.02 --> 02:26:50.42
I yeah, I mean, I haven't got the role of time lately. I think I rolled maybe like a month ago,

1908
02:26:50.42 --> 02:26:57.14
but I just I hadn't been able to get back around to there's plenty of jujitsu to go on and

1909
02:26:57.14 --> 02:27:03.14
allstate. Roger that. Tim Kennedy just FYI your brother here has not been rolling lately.

1910
02:27:03.14 --> 02:27:09.14
I'm sure you will help remedy that situation. One of the things that you know for me,

1911
02:27:09.14 --> 02:27:16.58
jujitsu is is so important for so many reasons. And it's aligned with the reasons of like

1912
02:27:16.58 --> 02:27:23.86
being in shape, working out, working out every day. To me, that's that's therapy. That's therapy.

1913
02:27:23.86 --> 02:27:28.98
Right. That's therapy for me. And I know it's therapy for a lot of people. And I know,

1914
02:27:28.98 --> 02:27:34.34
hey, give me one day for where for whatever reason I literally can't work out. Like,

1915
02:27:34.34 --> 02:27:38.26
whatever it is. Like, I woke up at three o'clock in the morning to travel and then when I got home,

1916
02:27:38.26 --> 02:27:41.86
the water he could, where it's broken and I had three clients call me and then my kid was sick.

1917
02:27:41.86 --> 02:27:48.34
And what I, whatever the thing is, it just didn't happen. I can feel it. Right. It's like a mental,

1918
02:27:50.90 --> 02:27:59.14
negative emotion that's going on. Yeah. If I, if it's like seven o'clock at night,

1919
02:27:59.14 --> 02:28:03.30
my wife's about to serve dinner and I didn't get to work on it. Go, hey, give me 30 minutes.

1920
02:28:03.30 --> 02:28:07.14
I'm going to go hammer one out. It's like a whole bunch of whole bunch of whole

1921
02:28:07.14 --> 02:28:11.78
little changes. But whole world change. Hey, my time that you've worked out and you left and you're,

1922
02:28:11.78 --> 02:28:17.94
you're not happy that you worked on my bum that did that. Oh, man. So fitness, huge thing. And I,

1923
02:28:17.94 --> 02:28:23.54
I know that speaking of fitness, what's up with this new freaking like application you got out?

1924
02:28:23.54 --> 02:28:28.34
Yeah. Talk to me about this. I just, I just launched this news. So like, I've always wanted, look,

1925
02:28:28.34 --> 02:28:33.30
I don't, I don't want to be a bodybuilder. Like, I have no credibility. I don't have no idea how

1926
02:28:33.30 --> 02:28:38.26
you can do it, right? I don't want to be a trainer. I don't want to be any of those, right? But like,

1927
02:28:38.26 --> 02:28:45.30
I do enjoy the therapy side of working out of of staying in shape, of being able to, you know,

1928
02:28:45.30 --> 02:28:51.62
know that that if we get a fire, I can go perform or knowing that I can get us out, you know,

1929
02:28:51.62 --> 02:28:57.38
like, I mean, I, I, I still get a truck to go get after it, right? Like, I have to be a dad to my,

1930
02:28:57.38 --> 02:29:02.66
you know, to my daughters and, and look, at some point in a few years when I'm older,

1931
02:29:02.66 --> 02:29:07.14
they'll be dating boys and I still have to be able to kick their ass, right? So I take that very

1932
02:29:07.14 --> 02:29:17.06
serious. You know, so I, I still have this, I know how to train. And to me, you know,

1933
02:29:18.10 --> 02:29:23.54
I feel like the closest I became, all my, look at, look at what all my friends have in common,

1934
02:29:23.54 --> 02:29:29.38
they all train. You know why? Because, you know, where we got close to our closest friends,

1935
02:29:29.38 --> 02:29:35.22
suffering and training together, right? I mean, that's it. And so, you know, I tell you,

1936
02:29:35.22 --> 02:29:40.82
build a team. I launch this new app. It's on owned the dash training.com and you can get on there.

1937
02:29:40.82 --> 02:29:46.10
We got workouts on there. Um, getting workout, same stuff I do, right? It's not about,

1938
02:29:46.10 --> 02:29:49.06
are you going to get on there with a program to come out as a bodybuilder? No, I don't,

1939
02:29:49.06 --> 02:29:52.90
I don't want to be that. But if you want to get on there and get after it and have a program,

1940
02:29:52.90 --> 02:29:57.62
you can follow to get after it and to be able to leave and know you did something. It's like,

1941
02:29:57.62 --> 02:30:04.26
I call it practical fitness. It's like, you don't, it's not complicated. I'm a simple guy. I get it done

1942
02:30:04.26 --> 02:30:09.78
where I can. I like to think it's efficient. You know, it's efficient. I just get in what I can with

1943
02:30:09.78 --> 02:30:15.14
what I got. And that's what it is. So you real quickly, like, just mentioned, oh, when I'm out

1944
02:30:15.14 --> 02:30:20.98
getting on the truck. Because you're a firefighter. Yeah, firefighter, you know, I did that last

1945
02:30:20.98 --> 02:30:26.26
year. I got knocked that out last year because, you know, during COVID and I was like, man, I really want

1946
02:30:26.26 --> 02:30:33.54
to get back. I really want to, I really want to, I feel like I just, I have more to give. Like,

1947
02:30:33.54 --> 02:30:39.38
this country's giving me so much people. I've given me so much. And I just, I feel like I have an obligation

1948
02:30:39.38 --> 02:30:44.34
to give. And I want to do it by being able to put my hands on people and being able to be there

1949
02:30:44.34 --> 02:30:49.86
in their worst moments. And so yeah, I went got my certification, became an EMT, became a firefighter.

1950
02:30:49.86 --> 02:31:00.42
I got my commission in Texas. And yeah, so I was paid for probably six months, five, four,

1951
02:31:00.42 --> 02:31:04.98
five, six months. And then just my, my speeches and stuff started coming back. So I had to get off

1952
02:31:04.98 --> 02:31:08.34
the truck. And, you know, me, you talked about, I mean, I wasn't a forever thing. It was more about

1953
02:31:08.34 --> 02:31:13.62
getting experience and trying to just sharpen that craft. And then, you know, now I still volunteer.

1954
02:31:13.62 --> 02:31:19.46
And then I'm, hopefully I'll start doing some part time stuff, start picking up some shifts at this,

1955
02:31:19.46 --> 02:31:26.98
this, uh, one of my, one of my closest mentors in the fire service, Sam Stacks has just been there

1956
02:31:26.98 --> 02:31:31.94
for me the whole time and just kind of led me through like he's like the, we call him though, you

1957
02:31:31.94 --> 02:31:35.06
know, you know, the white bearers, right? Like he's like the white bearer to the fire service,

1958
02:31:35.06 --> 02:31:41.06
you know him. And, um, just been there close for, and so anyways, I did that. And, you know, I just

1959
02:31:41.06 --> 02:31:46.26
get out there and try to try to help people when they need it. And it's awesome, man.

1960
02:31:46.26 --> 02:31:54.58
I, uh, I, uh, I've talked to a lot of fire departments in the country and a lot of fire departments

1961
02:31:54.58 --> 02:31:58.98
use the principles from extreme ownership, from dichotomy leadership, from leadership strategy

1962
02:31:58.98 --> 02:32:07.06
and tactics. We, we work with these guys a lot. And I, I always feel like, hey, I appreciate what you guys

1963
02:32:07.06 --> 02:32:14.90
do. I know it's a hard job. I know it's like a rough job. I know that you see a lot of stuff that

1964
02:32:14.90 --> 02:32:20.66
sucks. And I know that a lot of it is like note like you, you, you think of firefighting, you think of like

1965
02:32:20.66 --> 02:32:28.10
a movie like back draft where it's like all kind of dangerous, but heroic. And the other part of it

1966
02:32:28.10 --> 02:32:37.70
that I know exists is the part that's like heroic, yes, but a different kind of heroic. And man,

1967
02:32:37.70 --> 02:32:45.30
you and I have had some conversations about that that even up to my appreciation for firefighters and

1968
02:32:45.30 --> 02:32:54.58
EMTs even more when you're talking about just the day to day life. I mean, it is, yeah, let me tell you,

1969
02:32:57.14 --> 02:33:05.54
first off, let's let's talk about police and like, uh, EMS side of it, police, paramedics, EMTs,

1970
02:33:05.54 --> 02:33:18.82
police, let me tell you, they are the unsung heroes of this nation. The, the strain that is put on

1971
02:33:18.82 --> 02:33:27.46
our, uh, the film, the system that we have, the demand from them. They're overworked, they're treated

1972
02:33:27.46 --> 02:33:35.06
like shit, um, on deployment 365 days a year. On deployment 365 days a year. On deployment 365 days a year.

1973
02:33:35.06 --> 02:33:41.30
And I'm telling you, they are dealing with the, the piece of the world that we want to pretend

1974
02:33:41.30 --> 02:33:54.98
does not exist. And it is here. Um, the respect for them is, if you see a cop, you see a, any of them,

1975
02:33:54.98 --> 02:34:00.82
a first responder, you should thank them and you should thank from the bottom of your heart

1976
02:34:01.70 --> 02:34:09.30
for what they do that you don't have to see. Um, I had no clue as much as I pretended like I thought I

1977
02:34:09.30 --> 02:34:16.26
did. I had no clue. The stuff that I see have seen, but just since I've been doing it,

1978
02:34:16.26 --> 02:34:27.38
is, is worse than anything I've seen in Afghanistan. Um, almost daily basis. Yeah, I mean,

1979
02:34:27.38 --> 02:34:31.86
you'll, you have shifts that nothing goes on, but you have days where it sucks. And, um,

1980
02:34:34.34 --> 02:34:38.18
yeah, it's in, and it's, what they go through is just, you, you can't,

1981
02:34:39.78 --> 02:34:43.54
what, what I went through in Afghanistan, which I'm not going to say is for everybody,

1982
02:34:43.54 --> 02:34:50.82
is, is, is what everybody's gone through, um, but it can't touch what I've seen here in, in,

1983
02:34:50.82 --> 02:34:55.78
in the United States. And, you know, I'll tell you where it really hit me one time.

1984
02:34:57.06 --> 02:35:03.86
Is whenever I, uh, I was working on ambulance, uh, me and my, one of my closest friends,

1985
02:35:03.86 --> 02:35:13.78
um, when we, when we pull up and, um, to call where a kid hung himself. And, uh,

1986
02:35:14.82 --> 02:35:18.10
I'm never forget it was like a hanging and I'm never forget he looked at me. He's

1987
02:35:18.10 --> 02:35:23.86
way, I mean, this dude is talking about solid. Real, he's, he's, he's awesome. He looked at me

1988
02:35:23.86 --> 02:35:27.54
and goes, hey, make sure when we get out, grab the bolt cutters. He's like, uh, you never know,

1989
02:35:27.54 --> 02:35:31.78
like, if they hung themselves with something, other, like I never even thought about that, right?

1990
02:35:31.78 --> 02:35:39.06
Like this guy just, you know, you just, you walk in and you just see, you know, you can't,

1991
02:35:39.62 --> 02:35:43.38
this is not war. This isn't somebody shooting at you because they hate you. I mean, this is a

1992
02:35:43.38 --> 02:35:49.46
kid who was so lonely that he hung himself. And this is what happens. This is happening in our world

1993
02:35:50.50 --> 02:35:54.90
every day. Has anybody ever thought about who comes and takes care of this?

1994
02:35:54.90 --> 02:36:06.90
You know, and it's the car ricks. You know, the, the, the, you know, it's just, it's something that we

1995
02:36:06.90 --> 02:36:12.66
try to pretend that doesn't exist. And you got these people who were just going out and doing this

1996
02:36:12.66 --> 02:36:16.42
every day. I have no clue as what they've gone through. I've seen a little just about this much of it.

1997
02:36:16.42 --> 02:36:20.98
Just a, a smidge of it. But they go out and they get up in the middle of the night to go and

1998
02:36:20.98 --> 02:36:29.70
be there for when you dial 911 and it's like these, these people. Um, not me, but these people

1999
02:36:29.70 --> 02:36:35.70
that I have, got to work with, that I've got to see who have done this for years. Like they really are

2000
02:36:37.46 --> 02:36:48.10
the real life Batman's Superman. You look at it. Like, you know, they, when you call them,

2001
02:36:48.10 --> 02:36:55.46
they go and answer whatever needs you need in the worst moments of your life.

2002
02:36:56.74 --> 02:37:02.18
And they go back and they live theirs and they walk the streets among us and they don't ask for anything.

2003
02:37:02.18 --> 02:37:10.98
And it is crazy. They are, they are really gods in. And it's, it's incredible. And like,

2004
02:37:10.98 --> 02:37:16.10
you know, the appreciation I have for them just getting to work next to them. I just, I'm honored to just be

2005
02:37:16.10 --> 02:37:22.58
able to be around them. But it's, you talk about the world, the world right around us.

2006
02:37:25.14 --> 02:37:30.10
I mean, the houses that you walk into, you're just so sad. I mean, it's the people you see,

2007
02:37:30.10 --> 02:37:33.54
the overdoses. And, and you know, you're just like, I'm telling you right now,

2008
02:37:34.42 --> 02:37:39.22
the one thing that I have have been able to see is that people are hurting.

2009
02:37:39.22 --> 02:37:47.94
And yeah, but I'll tell you this, it's a, it's been the most fulfilling thing I've done.

2010
02:37:50.82 --> 02:37:57.38
You know, how cool is it to be somebody to be the person that can show up when somebody

2011
02:37:58.26 --> 02:38:03.54
calls 911 because they don't know how to figure it out. How cool is that to be able to come up

2012
02:38:03.54 --> 02:38:08.98
on a scene to where everything's chaotic and they just need somebody to help them get through that

2013
02:38:08.98 --> 02:38:13.86
moment and you get to be that person, right? And that's where I think like my perspective has changed

2014
02:38:13.86 --> 02:38:18.50
on all this, like with my teammates or with all the people I've seen die and all this, like,

2015
02:38:20.02 --> 02:38:26.02
you know what's kind of cool is, man, is I, for some reason, I keep getting put in these positions

2016
02:38:26.90 --> 02:38:31.86
and it's an honor because I get to be the person that's there with them as their soul leaves their

2017
02:38:31.86 --> 02:38:39.54
body and how cool is that to be able to share that moment with somebody. There are last moments on

2018
02:38:39.54 --> 02:38:47.54
this earth. I sometimes I get to share that with them, these people and it's an honor. Like I walk away

2019
02:38:47.54 --> 02:38:52.90
and does it bother me? Of course it bothers me. But now I get to say, hey, you know what,

2020
02:38:52.90 --> 02:38:58.26
it was an honor. It was an honor that you shared that moment with me. Whether you obviously didn't

2021
02:38:58.26 --> 02:39:05.86
choose to, but obviously we're here for a reason and I get to do this and it is like, it's awesome.

2022
02:39:06.50 --> 02:39:17.94
It is awesome. It's awesome. I've been lucky enough to work with police departments around the

2023
02:39:17.94 --> 02:39:23.94
country and what's interesting about what you were saying is that like you said, it's underneath

2024
02:39:23.94 --> 02:39:29.54
the surface, right? And I think when you see something on the news, you know, you see a shooting on

2025
02:39:29.54 --> 02:39:37.46
the news or a suicide or an overdose, we have a tendency to think that it's somewhere else.

2026
02:39:38.26 --> 02:39:46.50
Yeah, it's someone else. And I'm telling you small towns, big towns, cities, country, rural,

2027
02:39:46.50 --> 02:39:55.54
north, south, east, west. You don't have to go very far, quote beneath the surface because,

2028
02:39:55.54 --> 02:40:02.02
by the way, socio-economic class doesn't matter. You go to rich people's houses, you go to poor

2029
02:40:02.02 --> 02:40:09.78
people's houses, you go to the projects and there's people that are in their worst moments.

2030
02:40:09.78 --> 02:40:19.54
And then worst moments. And like you said, it's these first responders that are out there

2031
02:40:20.10 --> 02:40:30.74
that they answer that call every time. Every single time, every single time. And they do it for years.

2032
02:40:30.74 --> 02:40:40.66
They do it for years and on and it is like watching them, you know, just like literally,

2033
02:40:41.22 --> 02:40:47.30
they prepare for the unknown. They never know what the call is going to be. Like they literally

2034
02:40:47.30 --> 02:40:52.58
wake up every day to be, whatever you need them to be when they need to be it. And I'm telling you,

2035
02:40:53.38 --> 02:41:00.02
and they do it and they do it. They're, it's such a police, especially like police,

2036
02:41:00.02 --> 02:41:05.14
such a thankless job obviously right now, right? And they're out there doing their best and they're out there,

2037
02:41:05.46 --> 02:41:10.66
just trying to, just trying to, to be what people need them to be. And at the end of the day,

2038
02:41:11.54 --> 02:41:18.34
they're no different than you are. There are mother, there are sister, there are father,

2039
02:41:18.90 --> 02:41:24.66
there are son, there are no different than you are. The only difference is that they chose to put a

2040
02:41:24.66 --> 02:41:34.10
badge on to go serve other people. They're not, they're not some trained robot. They're not

2041
02:41:34.10 --> 02:41:41.22
some person who is, you know, was was born with all these, mind reading activities or can

2042
02:41:41.22 --> 02:41:46.74
read the future to know if someone's going to kill them tonight. They are just like you are. They are

2043
02:41:46.74 --> 02:41:53.06
as scared as you are. They, they don't want to do, like they got their own problems at home and

2044
02:41:53.06 --> 02:41:58.66
guess what they do. They choose to set theirs aside and they don't, let me tell you upfront,

2045
02:41:58.66 --> 02:42:06.98
they don't do it for the pay. They do not do it for the pay. They, they don't do that. They do it because

2046
02:42:06.98 --> 02:42:13.62
they care about people. I don't care. They're intent. They don't stay in that job without good intent.

2047
02:42:13.62 --> 02:42:24.50
It's not possible. It is not possible. It ain't worth it. It is not worth it. But it's awesome, man. It's

2048
02:42:24.50 --> 02:42:28.82
awesome. Like it's just awesome. Like I, I would get on a truck with these guys and I would just

2049
02:42:28.82 --> 02:42:35.78
look at them and all of just like no matter how chaotic it got, they, they had it and it was like,

2050
02:42:35.78 --> 02:42:42.50
this is awesome. I want to be one of them. How often do you walk around and say that? I want to be

2051
02:42:42.50 --> 02:42:50.58
one of them. It's badass. They're badass. Absolutely. All you mentioned a couple of times today,

2052
02:42:50.98 --> 02:42:56.26
the new book, the new book coming out, tells about the new book, the way forward.

2053
02:42:56.26 --> 02:43:06.66
Yeah. So I wrote a book. Me and Rob, oh, Neil, we speak for the same speaking agents.

2054
02:43:08.34 --> 02:43:13.70
Me and Rob connected on not necessarily about like combat stuff. But just more about

2055
02:43:15.78 --> 02:43:21.86
this life. We both come from small towns. We both are somewhere that neither one of us

2056
02:43:21.86 --> 02:43:30.10
you know, ever thought we would be, right? You know, and we both have stuff that haunts us. And

2057
02:43:30.10 --> 02:43:34.66
that was kind of where we connected of like, how do we put a book together, kind of talking about

2058
02:43:36.82 --> 02:43:43.14
giving some perspective that we're no different than anybody else. You know, that's the

2059
02:43:43.14 --> 02:43:49.38
one thing that I always felt like a lot of these war books came back, right after you know,

2060
02:43:49.38 --> 02:43:56.90
these war books came out. And I feel like all the way up until Chris Collins movie, there wasn't

2061
02:43:56.90 --> 02:44:02.66
really that humanization piece, right? And Chris Collins movie, they they showed more of the, when he

2062
02:44:02.66 --> 02:44:07.14
was coming back home between deployments, the struggle sometimes, right? And I think that was a first

2063
02:44:07.14 --> 02:44:15.46
time in any of the movies that it ever really hit. And you know, I always felt like in our books that

2064
02:44:15.46 --> 02:44:21.30
we wrote, we built ourselves up to be something great, but we never showed that we never humanized

2065
02:44:21.30 --> 02:44:28.58
the factors of war. And you know, that was a piece that always got me and we kind of like

2066
02:44:28.58 --> 02:44:34.02
when I came home. And so like, you know, in the way forward, it's just about life, like a lot of

2067
02:44:34.02 --> 02:44:39.38
stories that I told today, you know, that I've against stories in there, right? Like the, you know,

2068
02:44:39.38 --> 02:44:44.58
the story I talk about my grandpa, you know, just about, you know, the the circle. I talk about my

2069
02:44:44.58 --> 02:44:49.06
circle and what I talk about Tim Kennedy, the story I told you. I put that in there about how like

2070
02:44:49.06 --> 02:44:58.02
between Tim, Shane, and Brandon, my friends about how like, you know, you got the sword, the

2071
02:44:58.02 --> 02:45:06.10
shield in the armor, right? And those are like that, that how each of them fit. And you know,

2072
02:45:06.10 --> 02:45:12.74
I talk about, you know, my struggles in Alaska, I talk about, not, you know, about like my

2073
02:45:12.74 --> 02:45:16.66
divorce. I talk, you know, I talk about all this and I talk about more of the human fact side of it,

2074
02:45:16.66 --> 02:45:22.74
to human eyes about who we are. And I know, and I think it's going to be great. It comes out in July,

2075
02:45:22.74 --> 02:45:27.06
and I think it's going to be great because at, you know, I think it's coming at a probably a good time

2076
02:45:27.06 --> 02:45:34.10
in the country of where people are looking for a way forward, right? And that's kind of where it

2077
02:45:34.10 --> 02:45:41.14
comes around. So what's the layout? What's the, normally, as you know, I read books before

2078
02:45:41.14 --> 02:45:45.94
people come on here, but in this case, you handed it to me today. And so you've got a new book

2079
02:45:45.94 --> 02:45:53.06
coming up. So what's the format of it? So basically, in each chapter, Rod tells a story,

2080
02:45:53.06 --> 02:45:57.46
you can find all story. For each chapter? For each chapter. Is there a common theme between you?

2081
02:45:57.46 --> 02:46:01.46
Yeah, so like if you look at like if you, you know, when you read it, you know, I haven't looked at it

2082
02:46:01.46 --> 02:46:07.78
because you know what, you can give it to me. So today. So that's your tricky way of getting back here again.

2083
02:46:07.78 --> 02:46:13.14
Yeah, you know, like that, right? So you know, you talk about like American boys, like that's the first

2084
02:46:13.14 --> 02:46:19.46
chapter taking aim, find your heroes, you know, drilling and open your eyes. Like, you know, I talk about,

2085
02:46:19.46 --> 02:46:23.62
I kind of, you know, like one of the stories I talk about in here that I felt like,

2086
02:46:24.82 --> 02:46:29.94
you know, my cousin Steven was, I mean, you talk about a guy who was always there for me, right?

2087
02:46:29.94 --> 02:46:34.34
And especially one of my biggest cheerleaders when I went to Marine Corps. And,

2088
02:46:34.34 --> 02:46:44.02
um, man, when I came back and I was just in that dark mode, um, you know, he had a kid,

2089
02:46:44.42 --> 02:46:49.46
and married and all this and like he got busy, right? And, you know, he just wasn't answering the phone.

2090
02:46:49.46 --> 02:46:55.86
And I took it as, he's like, leaving me, leaving me hanging, right? But really, now that I'm a father,

2091
02:46:55.86 --> 02:47:03.46
I get it. Um, so, mean him got into it pretty bad and like, I tell you, I, uh,

2092
02:47:05.94 --> 02:47:12.18
I'll over it just because of ego and resentment. Um, I invited everybody in my family except him

2093
02:47:12.18 --> 02:47:22.02
to the metal of honor ceremony. And, uh, you know, man, I, that's one of the dudes that stood by me

2094
02:47:22.02 --> 02:47:27.30
the whole time, you know? And, uh, just, just stuff like that, like, lessons of,

2095
02:47:28.42 --> 02:47:33.14
hopefully, if I can't meet somebody that they can read this book and, and maybe it touches their

2096
02:47:33.14 --> 02:47:38.02
life to say, you know what, maybe I'm doing this in my life right now before I go and, and mess it up,

2097
02:47:38.02 --> 02:47:42.82
even worse, you know, maybe I, you can look at this as, as a little bit of perspective that maybe

2098
02:47:43.70 --> 02:47:50.26
maybe some mentorship, you know, um, but yeah, it's just all stories about that, that you should be able,

2099
02:47:50.26 --> 02:47:55.30
you know, everybody could relate to whether you served in combat or you didn't, and Rob's is the same way,

2100
02:47:55.30 --> 02:48:00.58
you know, Rob's just talking about, um, basketball about growing up and, you know,

2101
02:48:01.70 --> 02:48:06.26
you Montana, I mean, Rob has got some funny stories. I'm laughing because, um,

2102
02:48:07.14 --> 02:48:14.18
Rob and I were on deployment. It was like 99 or 2000. And I don't even think we had aimed,

2103
02:48:14.18 --> 02:48:19.22
we were like, went to the gym to work out. And there were some dudes playing basketball.

2104
02:48:19.22 --> 02:48:23.14
Yeah. And I played basketball. I sucked, but like I played basketball in high school, you know,

2105
02:48:23.14 --> 02:48:28.10
when I was a point card, so I could like dribble at some ballhandling skills. I could pass and whatnot,

2106
02:48:28.10 --> 02:48:32.50
but I, I would like get more steals in a game than I would points, right? Parts because of my

2107
02:48:32.50 --> 02:48:37.14
position, but parts because I, and I was like, I was a hustler, right? I would be, I'd every game

2108
02:48:37.14 --> 02:48:44.18
I'd be with like skin knees and skin, it looks like dive on every ball. Well, well, Rob's like, uh,

2109
02:48:44.18 --> 02:48:48.98
he played a little bit of college ball and being from Montana, most of the time you find

2110
02:48:48.98 --> 02:48:52.82
with people that are from the north, they're really good at shooting because, you know, you can't

2111
02:48:52.82 --> 02:48:57.06
dribble in the wintertime. So you just sit out there and shoot, shoot, oops. So he could, he could,

2112
02:48:57.06 --> 02:49:01.54
he could shoot. And we're like walking across, you know, in our running shoes, ready to go work out.

2113
02:49:01.54 --> 02:49:06.10
And there's some guys, you know, playing some ball. We had one, I think we had one or two other

2114
02:49:06.10 --> 02:49:11.30
guys with us. Yeah. And you know, Rob, you know, constantly talking shit to everybody. You know,

2115
02:49:11.30 --> 02:49:14.90
he said something like, oh, nice shot, you know, the dudes were like, oh, you guys want some?

2116
02:49:14.90 --> 02:49:20.66
And Rob's like, yeah. Yeah. And you know, these kids were wearing, you know, air Jordan.

2117
02:49:20.66 --> 02:49:26.98
And they were like, they were ready to run some game on us. Nike shot. Yeah. Yeah. Nike shocks and stuff.

2118
02:49:26.98 --> 02:49:32.10
And Rob, I mean, I get, no, you, he's a little taller, right? What's he? Six one, Pice.

2119
02:49:32.10 --> 02:49:35.70
Yeah, six, six, six, one. Yeah, maybe six ones. But you're not looking at him thinking he's a baller,

2120
02:49:35.70 --> 02:49:40.50
especially he's like, you know, a pale white dude with red hair with red hair. And, you know,

2121
02:49:40.50 --> 02:49:47.14
so they're looking at us like, oh, these nerds and sure enough, man, like, it's a great combo.

2122
02:49:47.14 --> 02:49:51.70
Because I could, I could ball handling. And I could just, I would just feed him and he's just hitting jump shot,

2123
02:49:51.70 --> 02:49:57.30
jump shot, outside shot, jump shot. We just destroyed him and we walked off and we've Rob still talking shit.

2124
02:49:58.02 --> 02:50:02.66
You know, like, yeah, I mean, you know, I, I love Rob death.

2125
02:50:02.66 --> 02:50:09.30
Uh, great guy. Um, you know, he's, he's always been, I tell you what, he's been one of my biggest cheerleaders.

2126
02:50:11.30 --> 02:50:15.22
Yeah, and it was just, it was, we wrote this book together. I think it's, you know, it's going to be good.

2127
02:50:15.22 --> 02:50:20.26
You know, hopefully it gets out there and helps people and yeah, you know, it's going to be awesome.

2128
02:50:20.26 --> 02:50:23.70
Right on, well, I look forward to reading it now that I have a copy.

2129
02:50:23.70 --> 02:50:28.50
Yeah. What else, what's the future? What else you got coming up? You know, I,

2130
02:50:28.50 --> 02:50:33.94
you know, getting, you know, getting, we're going to do this book tour starting July.

2131
02:50:35.54 --> 02:50:42.10
We're out there. We're, uh, pushing the discipline go. Right. The best flavor there is.

2132
02:50:42.10 --> 02:50:46.10

2133
02:50:47.22 --> 02:50:52.26
Dax, have it. So you got your own energy drink is what I'm hearing. Well, I don't, I'm on flavor. Yes.

2134
02:50:52.26 --> 02:50:55.54
Okay. Well, it's kind of easier. Yeah. Dax, have it, you know.

2135
02:50:55.54 --> 02:51:00.58
Um, it's uh, wins the tour taking place. So why do you lie? And then what do you,

2136
02:51:00.58 --> 02:51:04.10
you guys are going to different cities? Yeah. So, you know, we're, well, I guess we'll see

2137
02:51:04.10 --> 02:51:08.18
you, right? I mean, the right. Because of Miss Rona. Well, yeah. I mean, you know, that,

2138
02:51:08.18 --> 02:51:11.62
I guess they're like, they're doing virtual book signing. So we're going to have those going. But,

2139
02:51:11.62 --> 02:51:16.18
but, you know, me and Rob both have talked it. We want to get on the road. Like, we want to go out and see people.

2140
02:51:16.18 --> 02:51:20.50
I want to honestly, man, I just want to go and get around people and be able to fire people up,

2141
02:51:20.50 --> 02:51:24.50
get them excited about life again. You know, get them excited. Look, it's going to be all right. Like,

2142
02:51:24.50 --> 02:51:29.46
we're going to, we're going to get through this, you know, get out of the TV, get, get out of, get,

2143
02:51:29.46 --> 02:51:36.58
turn, turn the news off, get off social media and stop believing what people tell you and just

2144
02:51:36.58 --> 02:51:42.58
look around and believe what you see. Right. And, um, yeah. So that's, that's that, you know,

2145
02:51:42.58 --> 02:51:47.06
that's kind of, it's kind of what we're doing to crushing it. Well, before we jump into this support,

2146
02:51:47.06 --> 02:51:54.90
I kind of wanted to wrap this up, um, bringing it back to, to Colonel Charles Wittlesley, Wittlesie.

2147
02:51:59.30 --> 02:52:05.38
So at his memorial service, there was a friend of his family. This is in Petsfield,

2148
02:52:05.38 --> 02:52:12.58
Massachusetts, Adam and Wittleservice. And this family friend, who is also a judge,

2149
02:52:12.58 --> 02:52:20.34
a guy by the name of Charles Hibbert, he, uh, he delivered the, the ulogy.

2150
02:52:23.46 --> 02:52:32.90
And this is what he said, quote, we can sit here and say, he had so much to live for.

2151
02:52:32.90 --> 02:52:44.50
Family, friends, and all that makes life sweet. But no, my friends,

2152
02:52:46.42 --> 02:52:55.22
life span for him was measured those days in that distant forest. He had plumbed the depth of

2153
02:52:55.22 --> 02:53:08.18
tragic suffering. He had heard the world's applause. He had seen and touched the great realities of life.

2154
02:53:08.18 --> 02:53:26.02
And what remained was of little consequence. He craved, rest, peace, and sweet forgetfulness.

2155
02:53:26.02 --> 02:53:42.82
He thought it out quietly, serenely, confidently, minutely. He came to a decision not lightly or

2156
02:53:42.82 --> 02:53:55.06
unadvisately, and in the end did what he thought was best. And in the comfort of that,

2157
02:53:55.06 --> 02:54:18.26
we too must rest and quote and I disagree. I don't think we can rest. I don't think we should

2158
02:54:18.26 --> 02:54:25.70
rest. I think we must not rest. What I think we should do is help. I think we need to help

2159
02:54:28.58 --> 02:54:37.46
are veterans that are suffering and not just veterans, but people from all walks of life because

2160
02:54:39.86 --> 02:54:41.14
life is hard.

2161
02:54:41.14 --> 02:54:57.06
And no matter who you are, you either are facing or you will be facing disappointment

2162
02:54:57.06 --> 02:55:17.30
and despondency and loss. But don't give up. Just you got to keep fighting.

2163
02:55:17.30 --> 02:55:28.82
You got to get out of that echo chamber that your head is trapped in. You got to build relationships

2164
02:55:28.82 --> 02:55:40.66
with people. Then you got to move forward. Not just for yourself, but for the people around you.

2165
02:55:40.66 --> 02:56:04.66
So let's not rest. Let's help. Thanks for coming along, man.

2166
02:56:04.66 --> 02:56:12.02
Thanks for having me. And with what you're saying, that ain't quote, I agree. I tell people all

2167
02:56:12.02 --> 02:56:22.34
the time you do matter. You do. The biggest lies, the biggest lies that are told are the ones you

2168
02:56:22.34 --> 02:56:30.18
tell yourself. And just as the good times, they don't last forever, neither to the bad.

2169
02:56:30.18 --> 02:56:38.74
And you do matter. You do matter. Somebody somewhere is relying on you. Somebody somewhere.

2170
02:56:39.38 --> 02:56:46.58
Whether you've met on me or not, they will be relying on you and you do matter. And I'm with you.

2171
02:56:46.58 --> 02:56:53.70
Look, there's nothing weak about it. There's nothing struggle is struggle. You know, a lot of times

2172
02:56:53.70 --> 02:57:00.58
people, they see us as that, that, that, you know, we don't struggle or we don't have hard days,

2173
02:57:00.58 --> 02:57:05.30
because we don't necessarily walk around and talk about all the time, but like the hardest, even the

2174
02:57:05.30 --> 02:57:12.34
hardest people on earth, they got hard, not because easy times, they got hard because of hard days,

2175
02:57:12.90 --> 02:57:20.18
and they got through it. And it's a choice. And you just have to continue to choose to get through it.

2176
02:57:20.18 --> 02:57:33.86
And it's worth it. Indeed. Thanks for having me. Yeah, man. It's a freaking honor to have you on here.

2177
02:57:33.86 --> 02:57:42.26
Echo Charles. Yes. I'm not quite 100% sure that it's an honor for me to have you on here, but it's

2178
02:57:42.26 --> 02:57:51.30
pretty cool. Oh, it's an honor for you. Thank you. It's always an honor for me to be in your presence.

2179
02:57:51.30 --> 02:57:55.62
Yes, very, very big pleasure for you. We want to help ourselves. We want to help others.

2180
02:57:56.90 --> 02:57:58.90
What do you reckon? Select. What do you mean?

2181
02:57:58.90 --> 02:58:05.06
Hey, do you still have a fire helicopter? I sold it, but I'm getting another one. Are you getting like a

2182
02:58:05.06 --> 02:58:08.82
better one? I don't know what I'm making for one. Do you see different ones? Why was that one? No,

2183
02:58:08.82 --> 02:58:16.34
good. No, no, no, no, no, no. They only have like so many hours. Was that one getting close to the end?

2184
02:58:16.34 --> 02:58:20.82
Yeah. What do you mean like a projector light bulb kind of thing? Well, like after like so many hours,

2185
02:58:20.82 --> 02:58:27.22
they have to be rebuilt. Yeah. What models that one that you have are 44, Raventune? And those are like

2186
02:58:27.22 --> 02:58:34.74
very common. Yeah. They're like the Toyota Corolla of helicopters. Yeah. It's fun. It's a thought of

2187
02:58:34.74 --> 02:58:40.66
this video idea of a while ago, like last year. So like, let's do it. Now he's in the execution phase now.

2188
02:58:40.66 --> 02:58:45.86
So he likes to, he likes to, he likes to do it. No, no, I got, we got my buddies. We got like

2189
02:58:45.86 --> 02:58:51.46
four or five of them out there. So let's do it. Well, I gained access to a 3D model of your helicopter.

2190
02:58:52.10 --> 02:58:57.78
And I saw little videos of it. So I'm like, and so I made it look like you're, so I was going to do something.

2191
02:58:57.78 --> 02:59:05.06
But yeah. But you know, it's been a decade. It's been a decade. I'd be a for a year. That's what kind of,

2192
02:59:05.06 --> 02:59:10.58
you know, actively we got going on over there. Still doing my research. Hey, the last podcast that just

2193
02:59:10.58 --> 02:59:20.42
came out. It's two, I think it's 275. Yeah, 275 helicopter pilot from Vietnam. And there's the best.

2194
02:59:20.42 --> 02:59:27.22
You, you, you use a check it out for sure because he just flying that huian. We kind of got more into

2195
02:59:27.22 --> 02:59:34.18
the, like a, just questions about like flying that thing and how hard it is to fly a helicopter.

2196
02:59:34.18 --> 02:59:40.82
And there was one quote in there. His dad was a master chief in the Navy. So this guy is a freaking

2197
02:59:40.82 --> 02:59:46.50
worn officer, whatever, worn officer too. And his dad is a master chief in the Navy. Oh,

2198
02:59:46.50 --> 02:59:50.18
was a match. He became like Lieutenant Commander in Navy. And then goes to see him.

2199
02:59:51.14 --> 02:59:56.10
Or no, he's stationed in Saigon. The, the dads in Saigon, like we're doing some bureaucratic,

2200
02:59:56.10 --> 03:00:02.02
whatever logistics thing. And the sons up freaking fine. Ops every day. He goes and picks up his

2201
03:00:02.02 --> 03:00:07.22
dad and brings him up to wherever they were out in the bush and starts flying missions with his

2202
03:00:07.22 --> 03:00:13.94
dad. It's dads on the 50 cow. He's dad's like, is that like 45 years old like a Lieutenant Commander

2203
03:00:13.94 --> 03:00:19.94
up there just get, they get into firefight's bro. He's dads on the 50 cow. Anyways, his dad says

2204
03:00:19.94 --> 03:00:24.18
to him like after a couple of days ago. You know, I, I, I work with a lot of Air Force guys and

2205
03:00:24.18 --> 03:00:27.86
those Air Force, those jet fighter pilots, you know, they're always so positive. They're always

2206
03:00:27.86 --> 03:00:32.74
having such a good time. And you guys are all miserable walking around like everything's horrible.

2207
03:00:32.74 --> 03:00:39.22
What's up with that? And he says, well, dad, Air Force fighter pilot is flying an aircraft that

2208
03:00:39.22 --> 03:00:44.26
wants to fly that, that, that if you don't do anything, it's kind of going to just keep flying.

2209
03:00:44.26 --> 03:00:49.38
Yeah. He goes, we're flying something that doesn't want to fly. It wants to fly. And if we don't

2210
03:00:49.38 --> 03:00:53.78
balance these four different things, it's going to go down. And we're close enough to

2211
03:00:53.78 --> 03:00:57.78
know that people are shooting at us with machine guns and RPGs and everything else on top of it.

2212
03:00:57.78 --> 03:01:03.14
So you want to know why we're freaking stressed? That's why. Next question. Next question, dad.

2213
03:01:04.18 --> 03:01:10.82
He's talking about a father's son relationship after that. Dude, freaking crazy, right? It's crazy.

2214
03:01:10.82 --> 03:01:13.14
Hey, dad, I'm going to come pick you up when I'm going to take you on to run some.

2215
03:01:13.14 --> 03:01:19.22
They did three days of operations. That's crazy. His dad shot and look, he is that shot

2216
03:01:19.22 --> 03:01:24.98
a 50 cow. Who shooting a 50 cow out of the, out of the Huey? That's kind of move a Huey a little

2217
03:01:24.98 --> 03:01:30.66
bit. Don't you think? Like you're moving a little bit. I don't know. I'm not, they got so much power.

2218
03:01:31.46 --> 03:01:39.38
Yeah, I know things are. Yeah, damn, but the thing is, they do, but it's weird talking to him.

2219
03:01:40.34 --> 03:01:46.34
It's the first time that I really got the feeling of like, man, how in touch with those aircraft

2220
03:01:46.34 --> 03:01:51.22
those guys were? Yeah, like you, you can't be reactive. Like it's like balancing yourself on a

2221
03:01:51.22 --> 03:01:56.10
beach ball. Yeah, and it's part of them. Yeah, they flew to the point where it's part of them. And so that's

2222
03:01:56.10 --> 03:02:01.94
why I say like when they're like, like there'd be like a little thing like, uh, they could tell

2223
03:02:01.94 --> 03:02:06.02
like how much weight they had on. They're like, oh, we're 100 pounds heavy. How do you tell your

2224
03:02:06.02 --> 03:02:09.78
100 pounds heavy on a freaking helicopter? The way they could, they were just, they just knew

2225
03:02:09.78 --> 03:02:15.94
everything and they were so in touch with those birds. It's freaking nuts, man. Yeah, it's the power load.

2226
03:02:15.94 --> 03:02:24.18
Yeah, I'm much power. It takes to come all. Yeah, freaking crazy. Yeah. Um, yeah, awesome. So echo

2227
03:02:24.18 --> 03:02:31.94
Charles, trying to get better. Yes. Trying to be better. What do you recommend? Well, let's start

2228
03:02:31.94 --> 03:02:37.86
with these illustrious healthy energy drinks. You know, we don't all have our own flavor.

2229
03:02:39.70 --> 03:02:43.14
Maybe someone's doing something. I'm like, you said, I'm a little bit like a

2230
03:02:43.14 --> 03:02:46.66
little, you're not all so small. That's all that. Look at that. Some of them will still. But

2231
03:02:46.66 --> 03:02:52.98
either way, flavor, whichever flavor, these are good things. Tell us about uh, it was kind of

2232
03:02:52.98 --> 03:03:01.54
interesting. How did you end up with this? Who'd you talk to? You? Always me?

2233
03:03:05.54 --> 03:03:10.02
You said you're still in touch. I can't remember. Yeah. I don't know. What'd you call me up and say,

2234
03:03:10.02 --> 03:03:16.50
yeah, I should have my own flavor? No, no, you, you said it after I, I got

2235
03:03:16.50 --> 03:03:21.46
rabbedo on the other energy drink. Right. And you're like, I was like, oh, I remember saying, bro,

2236
03:03:21.46 --> 03:03:25.14
you can't be drinking that stuff. What's in it? It's this, this, this, I went through

2237
03:03:25.14 --> 03:03:28.74
everything like, bro, let me send you some real shit. Yeah. And then you're like,

2238
03:03:28.74 --> 03:03:32.34
we'll make your own flavor. Yeah, then I said, what flavor do you want? What flavor do you like?

2239
03:03:32.90 --> 03:03:38.02
Do you see, how did you forget? Well, how are you gonna add? Oh, I remember that. No.

2240
03:03:38.02 --> 03:03:43.38
Yes. I remember that now. But I remember saying like, well, what flavor do you like?

2241
03:03:43.38 --> 03:03:48.58
And you're like, I like Dr. Pepper. And I was like, okay. All right. We can work with that.

2242
03:03:48.58 --> 03:03:54.10
Because that's a cult following Dr. Pepper. It is. People is a cult following. But who wants to drink

2243
03:03:56.26 --> 03:04:01.30
high-frupped, those current syrup? Who wants to drink that? Well, probably nobody. If they knew

2244
03:04:01.30 --> 03:04:07.30
the reality, nobody wants to drink it. No, I hate it. So what we're talking about is this drink

2245
03:04:07.30 --> 03:04:17.38
right here? Well, his drink is called back savage. Back savage. It is black cherry vanilla.

2246
03:04:18.66 --> 03:04:22.82
It's totally healthy for you. How many did you drink? You just drink three?

2247
03:04:23.62 --> 03:04:26.82
That drink, three, two. You guys are fired up, man.

2248
03:04:27.86 --> 03:04:33.06
That's cool. We have to drink three to stay on your level. I don't know, man. I don't know. I can't

2249
03:04:33.06 --> 03:04:39.38
even remember that conversation with you about this. All right. So we got we got these awesome drinks.

2250
03:04:39.38 --> 03:04:44.18
If you want to get one go to get some go to jockelfuel.com and you can order them. You can also

2251
03:04:44.18 --> 03:04:49.62
get them from wall wall on the out on the east coast. By the wall wall, by the way, wall wall

2252
03:04:49.62 --> 03:04:55.46
put like put the brakes on me a little bit. They're like, well, because people are like going in

2253
03:04:55.46 --> 03:05:00.42
there and buying all of them. And we had to get our supply chain caught back up. So, by changing

2254
03:05:00.42 --> 03:05:07.46
it's caught back up. So roll on roll. Go get some clear those shelves. Tax average. Yeah.

2255
03:05:07.46 --> 03:05:14.02
Tax average. Tax average is your flavor. Yeah. So there you go. What else? Interesting. These drinks

2256
03:05:14.02 --> 03:05:17.22
is like one of those things where it's like, oh, yeah, I'm trying to improve. Let me do a, I don't

2257
03:05:17.22 --> 03:05:24.90
know, a pre workout. We'll call it a traditional pre workout energy drinks scenario. Technically,

2258
03:05:24.90 --> 03:05:30.66
I mean, it's, that's like a short term. Oh, very short. Half thing with long term detriment.

2259
03:05:30.66 --> 03:05:34.18
Yeah, I was going to say it's not just short term like, oh, but I feel good for a minute. No,

2260
03:05:34.18 --> 03:05:39.70
and now I legitimately am going backwards. I'm less healthy. Literally less healthy. Yeah.

2261
03:05:39.70 --> 03:05:44.10
No, do that. This is not like that. This short term and long term straight up straight up.

2262
03:05:45.62 --> 03:05:51.62
Tactical and strategic victory. Yeah. It's like, you know, the, you know, those combination

2263
03:05:51.62 --> 03:05:56.42
ancient combination locks on those old school movies. I don't know. Indian and jumped out.

2264
03:05:56.42 --> 03:06:00.90
I don't know. I want to be steel. Actually, but it's impossible to do. It's actually not an Indian

2265
03:06:00.90 --> 03:06:05.46
and it's, I don't think. Maybe it is. Either way, it's like that. If you figured out the combination,

2266
03:06:05.46 --> 03:06:09.86
it's the same. Yeah. That's a short term and a long term and it's healthy and it tastes good.

2267
03:06:11.06 --> 03:06:17.30
Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Incredible metaphor. Also speaking of tasting good,

2268
03:06:17.30 --> 03:06:21.94
we've got some additional protein supplementation called milk. I've been on that. I've been on the

2269
03:06:21.94 --> 03:06:27.22
train this past week. I have been to actually. Hey, is this a, is it a violation? And I always

2270
03:06:27.22 --> 03:06:32.74
have been actually looking at how, I guess I got a sweet. I got a sweet tooth. Okay, is this

2271
03:06:32.74 --> 03:06:37.54
violation? Let me put it to the other. You, I don't think you've done this, but this may have been done

2272
03:06:38.42 --> 03:06:45.06
from other people other than just me put dark chocolate chips in the milk. Right. Come on.

2273
03:06:45.06 --> 03:06:51.38
Yeah. I, no, I haven't done that. But I've done probably something equally. What is it? Is

2274
03:06:51.38 --> 03:06:54.74
this a violation? Do you think? Yeah, that's the question. Yeah. I don't think it's a violation,

2275
03:06:54.74 --> 03:07:01.22
but I have put ice cream straight up into my milk. Yeah. We'll say it's not a violation, but you're

2276
03:07:01.22 --> 03:07:06.02
pushing it. Here's the thing. I did it. I was like, okay, it wasn't worth it. Yeah, it kind of,

2277
03:07:06.02 --> 03:07:11.70
yeah, the, it has a, oh, it's going to be a no. No. Yeah. The reason for milk is because it already tastes

2278
03:07:11.70 --> 03:07:17.62
like dessert. It's like, can you have something, can dessert taste more like dessert? No, really,

2279
03:07:17.62 --> 03:07:21.62
you might opinion. Yes, like, like, I don't know if you like Rocky root ice cream, but let's say

2280
03:07:21.62 --> 03:07:26.26
you know, I'm a marshmallow. I'm going to, okay, all right, cool. I dig it then, but what if let's say

2281
03:07:26.26 --> 03:07:31.62
you know, it's more is no marshmallow is no. However, lucky charms back in the

2282
03:07:31.62 --> 03:07:37.86
world. It's a joke with this eating the freaking mushrooms. I love the lucky charms. Yeah, that guy,

2283
03:07:37.86 --> 03:07:43.14
bro. You know, I take the milk and what I do is I mix water with it and I put it in a bowl

2284
03:07:43.14 --> 03:07:47.54
in the morning and I'll mix water with it and then I'll like make a pudding out of it and I'll put it in

2285
03:07:47.54 --> 03:07:51.86
the, uh, I just I do it first thing in the morning and then I'll put it in their refrigerator

2286
03:07:51.86 --> 03:07:56.02
and then when I come home in the evening, I eat it like that. Oh, it's like pudding. Pudding.

2287
03:07:56.02 --> 03:08:00.26
It's interesting. Hey, so if you're just telling me those right now. So basically, you just like,

2288
03:08:00.26 --> 03:08:04.10
you can't put too much water. So you just put it like you just put like a little bit of water in there

2289
03:08:04.10 --> 03:08:07.70
and then see if it mixes it up and if you need just a little bit more, you put it in there until it's

2290
03:08:07.70 --> 03:08:13.94
basically like a like mud like mud and then you stick it in there for a generator and it is

2291
03:08:15.06 --> 03:08:20.50
listen, well, I'm afraid of you. We'll flavor you do. Well, so I, I like, I may have loved the pumpkin.

2292
03:08:21.78 --> 03:08:27.78
I'm just, yeah. The pumpkin is like, it's like pumpkin pie. He just looked like an addict when he said that.

2293
03:08:27.78 --> 03:08:33.22
Ah, he's like, I like the pumpkin. We talked about the toe, the DNT toe at earlier. You look more

2294
03:08:33.22 --> 03:08:38.82
exciting about the pumpkin. Oh, yeah. You gotta get on the pumpkin. You gotta get on the pumpkin.

2295
03:08:38.82 --> 03:08:42.34
That does make sense though because if I don't add enough, whether being milk,

2296
03:08:42.34 --> 03:08:47.06
you know when you make it in the blender the normal way. If I put a little bit of peanut butter in it,

2297
03:08:47.06 --> 03:08:52.02
though sometimes. So I've even the peanut butter flavor. Yes, okay. Sometimes. You're going to

2298
03:08:52.02 --> 03:08:56.98
O D on peanut butter, but it's all because it's very possible. But there had been times where I didn't

2299
03:08:56.98 --> 03:09:01.06
put enough milk or I put too many scoops in there. And yeah, after I blended it up, it was like,

2300
03:09:01.06 --> 03:09:05.54
oh, this is kind of like almost like a pudding. Now you need to throw it in the fridge. So,

2301
03:09:05.54 --> 03:09:11.06
don't let the fridge in the fridge. Oh, it's listen, you'll call me after you do that. And we'll say,

2302
03:09:11.06 --> 03:09:18.82
thank you. You'll freeze B to the quota. So, boom, again, another short term long term payoff

2303
03:09:18.82 --> 03:09:24.42
situation right there. It's a good strategic victory. Yes, sir. Yes. So, yes, go to

2304
03:09:24.42 --> 03:09:27.94
soccer field. That's where you can get all this stuff. Chocolatefield.com. Vitamin shop. You can get

2305
03:09:27.94 --> 03:09:32.82

2306
03:09:32.82 --> 03:09:37.14

2307
03:09:37.14 --> 03:09:41.70
to worry about that kind of stuff. We don't want to worry about getting sick. No. You're immune

2308
03:09:41.70 --> 03:09:46.58
system. We're about that. And you just worry about your immune system. Give it vitamin D 3. You don't worry

2309
03:09:46.58 --> 03:09:50.26
about that. It's nothing more. That's my point. You feel me seeing what you see them saying. Anyway,

2310
03:09:50.26 --> 03:09:57.70
you can get this stuff also at origin. USA.com. Yeah. It's a lot of stuff on origin. USA.com

2311
03:09:57.70 --> 03:10:04.10

03:10:04.10 --> 03:10:10.50
Geese. Rashcards. Rashcards. Or other purposes. What do you use a rash card for?

2313
03:10:12.18 --> 03:10:18.02
So, I'm out of, I'm using a wire rash card, but I wear those shorts as underwear. Oh, dang. Let me tell you

2314
03:10:18.02 --> 03:10:27.30
something. Which ones? Yeah. The, I mean, the one that's like the actual underwear. Oh, not those.

2315
03:10:27.30 --> 03:10:34.02
No. The ones like have the the constitution on them. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2316
03:10:34.02 --> 03:10:37.94
Do you just have to? Or this? Yeah. Those are, well, yeah. Those are those are those are supposed

2317
03:10:37.94 --> 03:10:41.70
to be underwear, bro. Oh, so you're actually using them in the correct manner. Yeah. Where

2318
03:10:41.70 --> 03:10:46.66
underwear is underwear, what happens when you roll it? What happens when you roll it on without

2319
03:10:46.66 --> 03:10:54.10
underwear? Oh, that's the stretch. Really? Yeah. Okay. Hey, the club. I don't know.

2320
03:10:54.10 --> 03:10:59.38
He's with you. I'm going to come roll with you, mind. Where? Bro, Dean, let's

2321
03:10:59.38 --> 03:11:04.18
start your business. Yeah. Yeah. He's the man. So yeah, that's great. I'm glad he's the man.

2322
03:11:04.90 --> 03:11:09.54
Here's the deal. Like in the early G. J. J. J. J. J. There was like this thing in Brazil, where they

2323
03:11:09.54 --> 03:11:15.22
would wear like, it's called a song. It's called a sungong. And then there's a long, a longer one

2324
03:11:15.22 --> 03:11:19.62
is called a sungong. But a shorter one's called like a sungonger. It's basically a freaking pair of

2325
03:11:19.62 --> 03:11:25.54
speedos. And Dean had something like that sort of like in between the two. But they're freaking

2326
03:11:25.54 --> 03:11:32.50
basically hot pants. Yeah. I mean, it's basically a speedo. And he'd roll with me, you know.

2327
03:11:33.62 --> 03:11:38.26
And like, you know, I'm going to see if I can get a pair. And I just are freaking nightmare.

2328
03:11:39.46 --> 03:11:44.10
And I'm glad that those things went out of style. How is it past in the guard?

2329
03:11:44.10 --> 03:11:50.34
Dude, it's just all adventure. It's, say what? It's not as bad as North South. I'll tell you that.

2330
03:11:50.34 --> 03:11:57.30
It's a freaking nightmare. Like you want to talk about PTSD, bro. Probably better. I got freaking

2331
03:11:57.30 --> 03:12:05.70
a damn animal male animal in a pair of white, tidy whiteies freaking all up on me. North South

2332
03:12:05.70 --> 03:12:11.78
them on top. Either way, bro. But at least, at least if I'm on top, I can maneuver. And I'm going

2333
03:12:11.78 --> 03:12:15.14
on, I'm going, cross-eyed, neon belly. I might even just run away.

2334
03:12:19.38 --> 03:12:26.10
Nightmares. I need eye-begined freaking recover from that. And then to be smart. Well, yeah, I think you're

2335

The American Party Podcast. So what happened to front-toured enemy? So in COVID-19, I just couldn't

2348
03:13:38.42 --> 03:13:44.02
get guessed in that kind of like- Okay, so you're back in the game with Dan. What's it called?

2349
03:13:44.02 --> 03:13:48.98
The American Party Podcast. So basically we just kind of talk about like what's going on in the

2350
03:13:48.98 --> 03:13:57.94
world and we, you know, put common sense logic. Sometimes those things are good. With the situation

2351
03:13:57.94 --> 03:14:05.22
that are going on right now. Right on, right on awesome. So check that out. How long have you been

2352
03:14:05.22 --> 03:14:11.30

2353
03:14:11.30 --> 03:14:15.06
episode of Front Tour there and it became out. And then we- And you just rolled right into that. Yeah.

2354
03:14:15.06 --> 03:14:20.98
Because it's just like I couldn't get into like interviewing people over zoom zoom. And I was like,

2355
03:14:20.98 --> 03:14:25.38
I'm out. Yes, different. It's different. It's different. It's hard to connect with them. I've done

2356
03:14:25.38 --> 03:14:30.58
a couple of them. Not for this one. We're trying to maintain the live situations. I've done a

2357
03:14:30.58 --> 03:14:35.78
bunch of zoom. And look, it's zoom is zoom is real close. It's depending on what you're going to talk

2358
03:14:35.78 --> 03:14:42.18
about. If people are just going to talk about, you know, whatever or some whatever, like not totally

2359
03:14:42.18 --> 03:14:48.10
surface topics. But if you're not going deep, you know, we're good. Yeah, I'll do zoom. If you're

2360
03:14:48.10 --> 03:14:52.26
if you're doing an interview like a maybe a standard for lack of better term interview like,

2361
03:14:52.26 --> 03:14:56.18
hey, this is going on. What do you feel about this? The code of mine. Then we wait for the

2362
03:14:56.18 --> 03:15:01.62
code of mine to answer. Oh yeah. Yeah. But it's hard to have a conversation. Exactly. Right.

2363
03:15:02.50 --> 03:15:07.94
So check out that podcast from Dakota. Also, you can subscribe to this podcast if you want.

2368
03:15:27.22 --> 03:15:31.06
And so you go look on your face like wait, did I really do that? No. Okay.

2369
03:15:31.06 --> 03:15:37.30
Anyways, let me try to recall when I said you do that in front of trust me. You trust me that I'm that I'm not

2370
03:15:37.30 --> 03:15:42.98
sitting here just making things up which I just did. Yeah. So I could never say that trust me. Trust me.

2371
03:15:42.98 --> 03:15:44.82

2374
03:15:52.74 --> 03:15:55.94
New one just came out. They're they're freaking.

2375
03:15:58.58 --> 03:16:02.66
It's a good place to learn grounded podcast about you. It's a warrior kid podcast. Some new episodes

just dropped. So you can check that out. If you want, we also have the jockel

2377
03:16:07.06 --> 03:16:16.34
underground dot com, which is another it's it's look what it is. It's a way for us to build a

2378
03:16:16.34 --> 03:16:19.70
network that we don't have to rely on anybody else. We don't have to rely on it. It's platforms. We don't

2379
03:16:19.70 --> 03:16:24.50
have to rely on any advertising. Nothing like that. So if you want to help out, you want to support

2380
03:16:24.50 --> 03:16:31.22
you can go to jockel on a round dot com. You can join that. And as a as a thank you, we do another

2381
03:16:31.22 --> 03:16:36.98
freaking podcast and answer questions. I'm going to be a now I'm starting to cover a little topics.

2382
03:16:36.98 --> 03:16:43.46
Yeah. Little topics. Little topics to give people some perspective because because

2383
03:16:44.50 --> 03:16:49.94
not everything is a jockel podcast, right? There's a certain you first of all, you can have a

2384
03:16:49.94 --> 03:16:56.02
jockel podcast. Really, that's like 18 minutes long. Yeah. You could, but it wouldn't be what people

2385
03:16:56.02 --> 03:17:01.70
are expecting. And normally we don't like to do that. So we made this other podcast talking about

2386
03:17:01.70 --> 03:17:08.34
different topics, educational topics, life topics. It's not all about to do with war and all that stuff.

2387
03:17:08.34 --> 03:17:13.54
It's not all all leadership, but but it of course it does include those things as well. So anyways,

2388
03:17:13.54 --> 03:17:17.86
if you want to check that out, how's this for a topic? You know, in your opinion, this might

2389
03:17:17.86 --> 03:17:22.98
pre-liminary thought. I think I might have sent it to you. I might not have the fight to use to get into

2390
03:17:22.98 --> 03:17:28.34
you. Not like as an adult, but you know, like as a kid, you know, like you could into like your first

2391
03:17:28.34 --> 03:17:33.14
fight. Like what was that? Oh yeah. And then go up through high school. I mean, I don't know. I'm not going

2392
03:17:33.14 --> 03:17:38.90
to put, I don't know what your actual experiences, but I thought of it because I was talking with

2393
03:17:38.90 --> 03:17:42.90
my wife and she reminded me of something that I said it and that she was like, oh, you're this bad

2394
03:17:42.90 --> 03:17:47.22
kid. And then I'm like, yeah, well, when you condense all the fights I ever got in in my life,

2395
03:17:47.94 --> 03:17:51.06
kind of seem like I was this bad kid. But it was kind of interesting to kind of go

2396
03:17:51.06 --> 03:17:57.54
through those in like debris. Compare. Yeah, it's like you compare your mindset, like as a kid

2397
03:17:57.54 --> 03:18:03.62
and then versus as an adult. Yeah, I got some, yeah, that's interesting. That's literally the

2398
03:18:03.62 --> 03:18:08.42
next thought I had was like, I wonder if like, because you know how you you've went through like some

2399
03:18:08.42 --> 03:18:13.46
stuff, you know, with especially in the hardcore scene and all this stuff. And then it's like, it's a

2400
03:18:13.46 --> 03:18:18.58
different, that's a different community. We'll say, yeah, yeah, it's weird to look back at those days.

2401
03:18:18.58 --> 03:18:23.78
It's very strange to look back at those days now. Yeah, very strange. So it's like, yeah, that'd be

2402
03:18:23.78 --> 03:18:28.50
really interesting. Because it's just a different like what you were saying earlier, Dakota about being

2403
03:18:28.50 --> 03:18:36.82
just younger. Yeah. I mean, when I was like 15, like my whole partially developed brain

2404
03:18:37.54 --> 03:18:45.70
filled with testosterone and rage. Yeah. Yeah. We got some interesting topics on there. If you want to

2405
03:18:45.70 --> 03:18:51.78
up, it costs money $8.18 a month. Again, this is how we're building a contingency plan in case

2406
03:18:51.78 --> 03:18:56.90
things go sideways. We'll still have a way to get this information out. If you can't afford that,

2407
03:18:56.90 --> 03:19:02.98
it's all good. We got you just email assistance at underground at jockel underground.com.

2408
03:19:02.98 --> 03:19:09.30
And we'll hook it up. We got a YouTube channel. Yeah. It's official. official. It's called

2409
03:19:09.30 --> 03:19:15.78
jockel podcast. Is that what it's called? It's called jockel podcast. And the good videos on there.

2410
03:19:15.78 --> 03:19:21.30
I am the assistant director of. Okay. So you can check those out. A origin also origin has a little

2411
03:19:21.30 --> 03:19:26.90
has a channel HD, a little HD that they put out. If you want to know what's happening up at origin,

2412
03:19:26.90 --> 03:19:32.18
as we rebuild America. And let's say what pretty soon, it looks like it could be also

2413
03:19:32.74 --> 03:19:36.50
if you want to see what's going on down there with origin. Because we want to be expanding

2414
03:19:36.50 --> 03:19:41.14
in small other states, some other opportunities are out there. So we can tell you to bring back

2415
03:19:41.86 --> 03:19:47.46
manufacturer, not just a main, not just a New England, but to America at large, which is what

2416
03:19:47.46 --> 03:19:52.34
we're looking to do. Yeah. True. Also, psychological warfare is an album that we put out a few

2417
03:19:52.34 --> 03:19:57.94
years ago, by the way. Still doing well. What it does is what you do is you listen to these tracks

2418
03:19:57.94 --> 03:20:03.70
of jockel letting you know how to get past these moments of weakness if they come about.

2419
03:20:03.70 --> 03:20:09.78
We work. We work. They will from time to time for sure. And if you might want a visual representation

2420

2424
03:20:40.98 --> 03:20:47.30
Hey, Dakota has a company here. We talk about every episode, flipsidecampus.com. Where did you

2425
03:20:47.30 --> 03:20:52.42
come up with the name flipside? You know, the last thing that my, the kind of fix said to me,

2426
03:20:54.10 --> 03:21:00.34
when he kicked off that morning, he said, uh, my I'll see you on the flipside. And, um,

2427
03:21:00.34 --> 03:21:06.02
that's for the name came from, you know, flipsidecampus, just trying to do another little part of

2428
03:21:06.02 --> 03:21:11.14
changing the world, the same thing that he stepped off to do that day. And, um, yeah, that's where

2429
03:21:11.14 --> 03:21:16.26
it comes from to motivate to be able to inspire people, you know. Um, you know, I figured out like

2430
03:21:16.26 --> 03:21:21.38
when we look at something, you know, when we, when we view something, it makes us feel a certain way.

2431
03:21:21.38 --> 03:21:26.66
It's connected, you know, our eyes are connected right to our soul. And then, um, you know,

2432
03:21:26.66 --> 03:21:31.46
so that's where the art came from of like, how do we put things out to where people see this and

2433
03:21:31.46 --> 03:21:37.54
feel something that inspires them? And that's, that's where flipside comes from. And also on top of

2434
03:21:37.54 --> 03:21:42.58
all that, once again, bringing manufacturing back to America, because it's all made America,

03:21:52.98 --> 03:21:58.10

2443
03:22:35.22 --> 03:22:39.70

2444
03:22:39.70 --> 03:22:44.02
people are going to buy this. They're like, oh, you know, he's, who is this guy? He's a hero,

2447
03:22:57.30 --> 03:23:01.54
when you approach me with your second third edition, it is brutal. Guess what? It's not

I appreciate you answering the phone. Yeah, I appreciate it. It's an honor. It makes me nervous.

2488
03:27:26.50 --> 03:27:34.50
But it's an honor. You know, but the next generation of sailors, soldiers, airmen, marines,

2489
03:27:35.46 --> 03:27:46.42
they need to have people to look to. And you're that guy. And to those that are out there right now,

2490
03:27:47.06 --> 03:27:51.94
that are protecting us on the front lines around the world, protecting our most sacred gift,

2491
03:27:51.94 --> 03:27:58.90
which is freedom itself. Thanks for holding the line. And to our people in uniform here at home.

2492
03:27:58.90 --> 03:28:02.98
And we know who those are. That's police and law enforcement. That's firefighters and paramedics

2493
03:28:02.98 --> 03:28:07.46
and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and boarder patrol and secret service. All the

2494
03:28:07.46 --> 03:28:17.78
first responders. Yeah. Thank you for being there when we call 911. And everyone else out there,

2495
03:28:17.78 --> 03:28:26.42
remember that life is hard and no matter who you are. You're going to face challenges. You're

2496
03:28:26.42 --> 03:28:32.90
going to face vicious challenges. At some point, you're going to be let down and you're going to let people down.

2497
03:28:34.66 --> 03:28:39.46
You're going to have failures and then you're going to have more failures. You're going to be

2498
03:28:39.46 --> 03:28:48.10
uncomfortable and you're going to be alone and every one of you out there. All of us, we're going to

2499
03:28:48.10 --> 03:28:58.50
lose somebody that we love. That's the way life is. That's what life is. And through all of that,

2500
03:29:02.18 --> 03:29:09.30
just remember that you have to get up. Remember to give thanks for what you

2501
03:29:09.30 --> 03:29:14.34
do have. Remember to give thanks for what you can do. And remember that your worst day is someone

2502
03:29:14.34 --> 03:29:27.06
else's dream. And like the Cota says, our last living legacy is a tombstone.

2503
03:29:30.26 --> 03:29:35.46
And that tombstone has your name and it states that day you were born and it states that day you died

2504
03:29:35.46 --> 03:29:43.62
but what really matters is that little dash in between. That's your life.

2505
03:29:48.02 --> 03:29:59.62
That is your life. So go out there and live it. And until next time, this is the Cota Meyer

2506
03:29:59.62 --> 03:30:05.14
and echo and jockel out.
