Guys at time, for them to go home, so you're constantly, he's constantly getting new troopers, new soldiers, new non-commission officers that are going to be the senior guys inside the platoon. These guys, you know, guys, you know, I'm really well, you know everything they're going to do. There's guys trickling in and out all the time throughout the entire chain of command, all the way up from the frontline guys, all the way up to the commander of the Platoon. And yeah, I mean, this McDonald ended up in a little bit better situation in the fact that he kept his legs, but Jodi, the way Jodi describes that in his books, very similar, you know, just boom and horrible situation. Platoon Sergeant Palaman got out in front of the platoon and a firefight and took an enemy rocket-propelled grenade in the right leg. That's also one of those things where you know, sometimes I get asked, you know, my boss is not doing this or we're not getting, we're getting a, we're not getting clear direction or I don't agree with this thing. He's not going to take charge of the squad, he's going to let them do what they do, and he's going to be more of an observer. Talking about some of the guys here, he's got guy named Jim Barnes from Asheville, North Carolina who is good solid operator, got a really bad stutter. Back to the book, if a patrol made contact with the enemy, and it lasted for any length of time, a second squad would be sent to react. You got people torturing and murdering old women and then you get this situation where there's a woman who's rushing the perimeter and this guy says she's don't shoot her and then crawls out. So it starts off there that was him going to this small little perimeter, but Platoon perimeter. Now, if you don't know security perimeter, it's basically 360 degree security perimeter of where you're, you have guns pointed to the outside and you have usually the leadership will be in the center of the perimeter. Because he isn't want to die, he's going to get killed by a criminal or getting a car accident, but you don't think about 10,000 people dying to be an ob just from other than combat. If I was going to die, and I began to grieve for myself, for my wife, for the little boy who would never really know his father, sweat poured from my forehead, my back, my every joint. The guys that graded them, the guys that were really good, really good leaders and really stepped up and really doing a great job, they'd give themselves a grade. War is the suffering and death of people you know set against a background of the suffering and death of people you do not. And this book right here is called Platoon Leader, a memoir of command in combat by James R. McDonough. And we got examples of leadership like McDonald uh, like the people that we talk about. Now, there's starting to get some intelligence report that there's ominous forecast that there's going to be some big attacks, some big enemy thrusts, and he's taking some time to prepare for that. And from the example of men like Jim McDonough and Hackworth and Bob Hoffman can't all those other those warriors and leaders that have taken point and led the way. And here you are, getting thrown into a combat environment on a very dangerous patrol into enemy territory that you don't know very well. So they get Killigan out of that situation, they get back to their base, they go back again to do the ambush, they're hit again on the ambush, they evacuated guy, they move again and now they're in the final moment where they are going to do this big ambush as part of the company. I'm in charge, do what I say to you know what, these guys know better than I do in many cases. So, the reason he's talking about that is when he goes out with the squads, there's a guy that's jueyered to him, a sergeant that's running the squads, running the patrol, and he's not going to go out there and be the boss. You're looking at every little thing in the road, every little piece of trash, every little wire, everything could be a pressure plate.
