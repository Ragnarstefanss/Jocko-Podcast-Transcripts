00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.56
This is Jockel Podcast number 305 with echo Charles and me, Jockel William Good evening,

2
00:00:06.56 --> 00:00:07.56
echo.

3
00:00:07.56 --> 00:00:08.56
Good evening.

4
00:00:08.56 --> 00:00:12.48
Also, joining us again tonight, Dave Burke, Good evening, Dave.

5
00:00:12.48 --> 00:00:13.48
Good evening.

6
00:00:13.48 --> 00:00:20.96
We are going to continue the review of the book, the psychology of military incompetence,

7
00:00:20.96 --> 00:00:26.04
which we started on podcast 303, continued 304, we're going to continue it more

8
00:00:26.04 --> 00:00:34.28
now. And we got through some examples in the last podcast of the wartime examples.

9
00:00:34.28 --> 00:00:41.32
We'll get through the rest of these examples tonight. And this is a big set up.

10
00:00:41.32 --> 00:00:48.44
This is an arduous set up for part two of the book. I don't know if we'll get into part

11
00:00:48.44 --> 00:00:53.000
two of the book tonight, which actually starts to dive into the psychology of military

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.04
incompetence. But like I said before, those explorations continuously refer back to the examples

13
00:01:02.04 --> 00:01:09.40
from the beginning, part one of this book, which is what makes the book powerful because it's

14
00:01:09.40 --> 00:01:16.20
not just theory, it gives you examples that connects the theory to reality. So that's what

15
00:01:16.20 --> 00:01:21.92
we're doing. If you haven't ordered this book, order it. It's called on the psychology of

16
00:01:21.92 --> 00:01:27.60
military incompetence written by Dr. Dixon, who is a combat better himself. If you haven't

17
00:01:27.60 --> 00:01:32.96
listened to podcast 303 or 304 yet, and go back and listen to those first, we're going through

18
00:01:32.96 --> 00:01:37.04
these military examples. And we're starting, you can see I'm starting to tune in, starting to

19
00:01:37.04 --> 00:01:44.88
call out some of these psychological pathology that ends up with bad leadership. And with that,

20
00:01:44.88 --> 00:01:53.76
we're going to go into the book. This chapter is called between war. So we end, we end world war

21
00:01:54.96 --> 00:01:58.80
one, and this chapter is called between the wars, because what should be happening between the

22
00:01:58.80 --> 00:02:03.92
wars, what should we be doing? We should be assessing what we did wrong, assessing what we did right,

23
00:02:03.92 --> 00:02:07.20
seeing what improvements we could make, seeing what new technology we could bring to bear.

24
00:02:08.08 --> 00:02:14.48
And let's face it, you fight a war like World War One, and there should be an insane amount

25
00:02:14.48 --> 00:02:22.24
of lessons learned. Unfortunately, this quote starts off with this chapter starts off the quote

26
00:02:22.24 --> 00:02:27.36
from George Bernard Shaw, and he says, the British soldier can stand up to anything except the British

27
00:02:27.36 --> 00:02:36.40
war office. What a horrible statement that is. Going to the book, military stock is never

28
00:02:36.40 --> 00:02:43.92
lower than at the end of a costly war. With a million dead, society's appetite for aggression has

29
00:02:43.92 --> 00:02:50.72
been a swaged. People were weary of the war, and tired of soldiering for the military, the truth

30
00:02:50.72 --> 00:02:58.32
was rubbed in by swinging cuts in men and material. We're done. World War One's done, you

31
00:02:58.32 --> 00:03:04.88
only think about being over it. They're over it. From being the most important members of the

32
00:03:04.88 --> 00:03:09.20
community, they were now relegated to a very minor role. That's the military. This thinly

33
00:03:09.20 --> 00:03:15.04
veiled and gratitude at three effects upon the military, with the horse yet self-consoling cry,

34
00:03:15.84 --> 00:03:21.52
now he can get back to some real soldiering. They withdrew into cocoons of professional

35
00:03:21.52 --> 00:03:26.08
impotence. In that strange, you get done with the war's arrow, now he can get back to

36
00:03:27.20 --> 00:03:31.84
soldiering, which for them, what does that mean? In accordance with the principle of that more

37
00:03:31.84 --> 00:03:38.08
floored aspects of militarism or defenses against threat to self-esteem, there was a falling back

38
00:03:38.08 --> 00:03:43.52
upon the rights of the barracks square, renewed attention to spit and polish helped to

39
00:03:43.52 --> 00:03:52.16
expunge the last traces of the mud of flanders. At higher levels of military hierarchy,

40
00:03:52.16 --> 00:03:58.80
service thinking was now embodied in an extract from a paper on Imperial Defense Data June 22,

41
00:03:58.80 --> 00:04:07.04
1926. The size of the forces of the Crown maintained by Great Britain is governed by various

42
00:04:07.04 --> 00:04:13.60
conditions, peculiar to each service, and is not arrived at by any calculations of the requirements

43
00:04:13.60 --> 00:04:20.16
of foreign policy nor is it possible that they should ever be so calculated. That's the most

44
00:04:20.16 --> 00:04:24.88
insane thing I've read in quite some time. Well, I guess since I read the last chapter of this book,

45
00:04:24.88 --> 00:04:32.08
hey, we're just going to, we're building our military, the size of our military is just based on

46
00:04:32.08 --> 00:04:35.92
kind of what they think it should be. How nothing to do with what's going on in foreign policy,

47
00:04:37.12 --> 00:04:44.56
no calculations. That's not what we're doing. In the period between the wars, the shape and the

48
00:04:44.56 --> 00:04:50.24
equipment, if not the size of the armed forces, were partly determined by a number of curious military

49
00:04:50.24 --> 00:04:56.24
attitudes, these center peculiar, particularly around three instruments of warfare, tanks, planes,

50
00:04:56.24 --> 00:05:02.32
and horses. Describing a tank attack, which he had witnessed in 1916, general surritched

51
00:05:02.32 --> 00:05:06.80
Gail tells how the British command tried to exploit it with cavalry. Apparently, they failed,

52
00:05:06.80 --> 00:05:11.20
as it was born out by the grim sight of riderless horses returning when they had come.

53
00:05:11.20 --> 00:05:20.88
Man, that's an eerie image, isn't it? Of this experience he writes, I was impressed by the

54
00:05:20.88 --> 00:05:27.12
potential of the tank as I was unimpressed by the employment of horse cavalry in modern warfare

55
00:05:27.12 --> 00:05:32.96
conditions, yet after all our experience in that war it took us further 20 years to mechanize our

56
00:05:32.96 --> 00:05:40.56
cavalry. The lesson was clear, but the lesson was as clear in 1916 as in 1936, and truth was not

57
00:05:40.56 --> 00:05:53.84
1936, but 1941 before the British began to implement lessons of 1916. What happened between these

58
00:05:53.84 --> 00:05:59.68
wars shows the alarming extent to which reactionary elements can draw the wrong conclusion from

59
00:05:59.68 --> 00:06:05.04
what to most people would seem quite unambiguous facts. Rather than recognize the potential of

60
00:06:05.04 --> 00:06:08.88
the tank, they drew the conclusion that innovation and progress are inherently dangerous,

61
00:06:08.88 --> 00:06:15.76
and therefore to be assured, the symptom is not without precedent nor confined to the army,

62
00:06:15.76 --> 00:06:23.92
while on naval maneuvers in 1893, Admiral Triand, wished to about face two parallel columns of

63
00:06:23.92 --> 00:06:29.84
battleships. From his flagship, he ordered that the two columns should reverse course by turning

64
00:06:29.84 --> 00:06:36.40
inwards. Unfortunately, the combined turning radius of the ships was greater than the distance

65
00:06:36.40 --> 00:06:44.88
between them. With mathematical inevitability, HMS Victoria was rammed by HMS camper down and

66
00:06:44.88 --> 00:06:53.52
sank with great loss of life. Other officers had seen what was going to happen, but dared not question.

67
00:06:54.72 --> 00:06:59.12
The lesson from this disaster seemed fairly clear. Admiral should base their decisions upon

68
00:06:59.12 --> 00:07:04.24
information supplied by their staffs and junior officers should not be afraid of speaking up

69
00:07:04.24 --> 00:07:11.92
when their knowledge, for example, the turning circles of naval craft and their special abilities,

70
00:07:11.92 --> 00:07:16.32
for example, superior eyesight and greater capacity for mental arithmetic, led them to believe

71
00:07:16.32 --> 00:07:23.60
that a given order would end in calamity. The argument seems sound enough. Indeed, even the

72
00:07:23.60 --> 00:07:31.36
most junior charlady, which is a cleaning woman, at the Admiralty, had she pondered the facts

73
00:07:31.36 --> 00:07:35.76
could hardly have failed to draw the same conclusion. But this was not the conclusion reached

74
00:07:35.76 --> 00:07:42.000
by her lords and masters. For them, Triand's lapse just went to show that it never pays to

75
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.04
try anything new. No, as the lesson learned. Don't do inward. Don't do. That's the lesson learned.

76
00:07:49.04 --> 00:07:58.32
Don't do inward turns in a column. To return to the tank, the successive chiefs of the

77
00:07:58.32 --> 00:08:03.84
Imperial General Staff between 1918 and 1939 with a support of other senior officers did not

78
00:08:03.84 --> 00:08:08.64
exert themselves to mechanize the army. Some were actively obstructionist.

79
00:08:10.24 --> 00:08:14.80
Against these reactionary elements stood a handful of progressive army officers and a few

80
00:08:14.80 --> 00:08:21.44
like-minded civilians, the progressives who would assimilate it incontrovertible evidence

81
00:08:21.44 --> 00:08:26.16
from the preceding war with Germany and were only two well aware of Hitler's preparations

82
00:08:26.16 --> 00:08:30.56
for the next made their views known through books, essays, lectures, and by word of mouth.

83
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.32
These moves were countered by the military establishment in two ways. So you got this whole group of

84
00:08:36.32 --> 00:08:44.72
people that are saying, hey, bro and bros, we need to make tanks a lot of them. We need to mechanize

85
00:08:44.72 --> 00:08:51.28
our cavalry. Look what happened. And that's what they're doing. Books, word of mouth, lectures, essays.

86
00:08:51.28 --> 00:08:58.48
These moves were countered by the military establishment two ways. Firstly, they resisted the

87
00:08:58.48 --> 00:09:05.92
Semination of Progressive Literature. Hey, stifle that paper. Secondly, they did their best

88
00:09:05.92 --> 00:09:14.32
to curtail the careers of those who questioned their own obsolete ideas. That's like evil.

89
00:09:14.32 --> 00:09:23.76
This far as I can see. Guys got a good new idea, curtail their career. For example, when

90
00:09:23.76 --> 00:09:30.48
Fuller and early protagonist of mechanization won the RUSI gold medal for his essay on tanks

91
00:09:30.48 --> 00:09:36.56
and later produced a book on the same topic, he was castigated by successive chiefs of staff

92
00:09:36.56 --> 00:09:42.48
and remained unemployed in the rank of major general for three years and then was forceably retired

93
00:09:42.48 --> 00:09:54.64
in 1933. In the course of these events, CIS, CIGS, Lord Kevin, whose ideas according to

94
00:09:54.64 --> 00:10:01.28
Fuller were about 800 years out of date, oh pine that no officer should be allowed to write a book.

95
00:10:04.08 --> 00:10:07.44
It's like insane. You can't make this up. You can't make this up.

96
00:10:07.44 --> 00:10:13.60
If you're ever in a situation where your subordinates are coming up with ideas that you don't

97
00:10:13.60 --> 00:10:20.96
agree with and your reaction is to shut them down, question yourself.

98
00:10:25.84 --> 00:10:30.32
Not to be outdone, his successor Field Marshal Montgomery delivered himself of a

99
00:10:30.32 --> 00:10:34.32
diatribe against Fuller's books while admitting that he had never read them because it would

100
00:10:34.32 --> 00:10:41.68
make him so angry if he did. Equally on ambiguous was the treatment metadout to LaDelle Hart

101
00:10:41.68 --> 00:10:47.04
a man described by the press as quote the most important military thinker of the age of mechanization

102
00:10:47.04 --> 00:10:54.000
in any country. This is the guy that we covered on the podcast. I don't know how many episodes

103
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.84
we did, but it's a lot of them. BH LaDelle Hart over the years LaDelle Hart produced a number of

104
00:11:01.84 --> 00:11:07.60
articles and books on mechanization on new infantry tactics and on the strategic and tactical use of

105
00:11:07.60 --> 00:11:14.08
armor. His efforts encountered extreme hostility and resistance from the British general staff.

106
00:11:14.64 --> 00:11:21.28
When he submitted his essay mechanization of the army for military competition, it was rejected in favor

107
00:11:21.28 --> 00:11:29.04
of an entry on quote limitations of the tank. The judges were a Field Marshal and a general and a

108
00:11:29.04 --> 00:11:36.24
Colonel. Unfortunately, LaDelle Hart's entry was not entirely lost to view. Why could that possibly

109
00:11:36.24 --> 00:11:41.20
be unfortunate? Well, it's because along with other products of his pen, it was enthusiastically

110
00:11:41.20 --> 00:11:48.48
studied by Hitler's Panzer General Guirdeen and became required reading of the German general staff.

111
00:11:48.48 --> 00:11:58.72
You can't make this up. You can't make this up.

112
00:12:02.56 --> 00:12:08.56
Like those of his fellow protagonists, LaDelle Hart's army career was prematurely cut short

113
00:12:08.56 --> 00:12:14.16
by the military establishment. The cases germane to the thesis of this book. Here is was a man

114
00:12:14.16 --> 00:12:20.24
who was cultured, fluent, lucid, highly intelligent and that rare combination, a soldier who was also a

115
00:12:20.24 --> 00:12:26.56
first class military historian, one whose advice on military matters was frequently sought by

116
00:12:26.56 --> 00:12:33.36
such civilian leaders as Hore, Bolisa and Winston Churchill who in due course became the military

117
00:12:33.36 --> 00:12:38.80
correspondent of the Daily Telegraph and subsequently the Times chosen by these papers and preference

118
00:12:38.80 --> 00:12:43.92
to a number of retired generals who applied for the same job. And Hore, Bolisa, by the way, was the

119
00:12:44.72 --> 00:12:52.24
Secretary of War, prominent figure. Here's a man whose views and writings were eagerly studied and

120
00:12:52.24 --> 00:12:57.60
acted upon by many foreign powers, including Germany, Russia, France and Israel, whose prophecies

121
00:12:57.60 --> 00:13:02.24
in the military sphere were born out time and time again and who lived to see his ideas on

122
00:13:02.24 --> 00:13:11.52
mechanization and tanks tactics used against us by Germany in 1940. But here was a man so deported

123
00:13:11.52 --> 00:13:18.40
by the British establishment, by the British military establishment that Lord Gortt, chief of the

124
00:13:18.40 --> 00:13:24.88
Imperial General Staff at the outbreak of the war felt moved to say during a lecture to 400 officers

125
00:13:24.88 --> 00:13:31.20
of the territorial army, quote kindly remember that LaDelle Hart does not occupy a room at the war

126
00:13:31.20 --> 00:13:43.28
office. So not only do these people that can kind of play the game, get advanced, people that

127
00:13:43.28 --> 00:13:51.44
have trouble playing the game, like LaDelle Hart get pushed out. Do I wish he could have played

128
00:13:51.44 --> 00:13:55.28
the game a little bit better? Absolutely. Do I wish he would have been a little bit more indirect?

129
00:13:55.28 --> 00:13:59.28
You know, in his book when he talks about if you become a prophet, you get crucified. He became

130
00:13:59.28 --> 00:14:07.84
a prophet, and he got crucified. It was the same Lord Gortt, the army's top man at the outbreak

131
00:14:07.84 --> 00:14:13.84
of the war, whom or the leadership described as a, quote, utterly brainless and unable to grasp

132
00:14:13.84 --> 00:14:18.80
the simplest problem. These are the people that are trying to get rid of LaDelle Hart.

133
00:14:21.44 --> 00:14:26.48
LaDelle Hart remarked if a soldier advocates, here's what here's exactly what happens. If a soldier

134
00:14:26.48 --> 00:14:32.24
advocates any new idea of real importance, he builds up such a wall of obstruction, compounded

135
00:14:32.72 --> 00:14:38.64
of resentment, suspicion, and inertia that the idea only succeeds at the sacrifice of himself,

136
00:14:38.64 --> 00:14:44.16
as the wall finally yields to the pressure of the new idea it falls and crushes him. That's what

137
00:14:44.16 --> 00:14:52.000
happened to him. Some military leaders, even in democracies, have become a depth at manipulating

138
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.72
their civilian bosses, such as the case over the issue of war minister Horabolisha.

139
00:14:57.84 --> 00:15:03.92
It seems he was not appreciated by military establishment. Five reasons, relevant to our general

140
00:15:03.92 --> 00:15:09.52
theory of military incompetence may be advanced for this, for this antipethi.

141
00:15:11.36 --> 00:15:16.64
Firstly, he was probably brighter than some of the senior officers with whom he had to deal.

142
00:15:16.64 --> 00:15:21.52
Secondly, his ideas for the army were progressive. Third, he made no bones about using LaDelle

143
00:15:21.52 --> 00:15:27.36
Hart as his military adviser, Fourthly. He was with every justification, critical of generals who's

144
00:15:27.36 --> 00:15:31.84
job at was to prepare the British army and France against the German assault on the West in

145
00:15:31.84 --> 00:15:39.12
1940, fifthly he was a Jew. It was a for a mixture of these reasons that the general staff persuaded

146
00:15:39.12 --> 00:15:44.08
Chamberlain to sack the man who had probably done more for the army and defense than any other

147
00:15:44.08 --> 00:15:55.44
single person during Hitler's rise to power. It's weird how generals, I mean it's not weird.

148
00:15:55.44 --> 00:16:04.08
It's so prevalent how generals become untouchables. How could you dare say anything about this

149
00:16:04.08 --> 00:16:10.32
general he served is and that's what's happening here. And look, just because someone served their

150
00:16:10.32 --> 00:16:16.40
country, just because someone served their country and did a good job as a platoon commander, as a

151
00:16:16.40 --> 00:16:20.24
company commander, as a battalion commander. It doesn't mean they're going to be awesome as a general.

152
00:16:21.84 --> 00:16:28.000
In fact, there's some some things might indicate that those are very different jobs.

153
00:16:29.60 --> 00:16:34.32
Especially when they did good as a company commander or a platoon commander during World War I

154
00:16:34.32 --> 00:16:40.96
wouldn't do a good job was not disobeying orders and doing what you were told to do and freaking

155
00:16:40.96 --> 00:16:46.16
scurrying to a position where you don't get killed. Right? Because what happened to the brave

156
00:16:46.16 --> 00:16:53.60
soldiers? Most of them got freaking killed. We've talked about this thinking tactically and thinking

157
00:16:53.60 --> 00:16:59.20
strategically are really, really different and it's actually really hard to evolve from a

158
00:16:59.20 --> 00:17:05.04
tactician to a strategist. And in the military there's kind of a very clear delineation. Your

159
00:17:05.04 --> 00:17:09.92
tactician is a junior officer and the middle officer is an operational guy with sits between them

160
00:17:09.92 --> 00:17:15.68
and the generals with the strategic thinkers. But that evolution is really hard. It's really hard.

161
00:17:15.68 --> 00:17:20.56
You've talked about Peter's principle. I think on the last podcast where you get promoted to your

162
00:17:20.56 --> 00:17:25.92
level of incompetence that barrier between tactical thinking and strategic thinking is hard overcome.

163
00:17:25.92 --> 00:17:30.32
Yeah. Well you run into it with companies as well where you get some dynamic person and a

164
00:17:30.32 --> 00:17:34.08
start up and they're the CEO of the company but there's only 48 employees and they can make things

165
00:17:34.08 --> 00:17:38.56
happen and they kind of impose it well and they can kind of win the market and talk to people

166
00:17:38.56 --> 00:17:44.000
in a good salesman and it's a good work out awesome. And then all of a sudden they got you know

167
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.52
500 employees and they've got a board and they've got regulatory environment that they don't know

168
00:17:49.52 --> 00:17:54.96
on a handle and they turn into a disaster. It doesn't always happen but what we fail to do is we don't

169
00:17:54.96 --> 00:17:59.92
really do a good job of training people and at least making them aware of the situation that they're

170
00:17:59.92 --> 00:18:05.44
facing. Yeah. The other thing I wrote down was you're talking about this is and I saw this as I got a

171
00:18:05.44 --> 00:18:09.60
little more senior in the officer ranks and kind of get a little more observation of that general

172
00:18:09.60 --> 00:18:16.80
officer tier or that flag officer tier for the Navy is what gets them there is a bunch of success. A bunch

173
00:18:16.80 --> 00:18:24.56
of success and with that success if you're not careful what that success can do and it's not just true

174
00:18:24.56 --> 00:18:29.92
in the military it's true everywhere is that success is this is equals validation. And if you

175
00:18:29.92 --> 00:18:36.08
kind of start to get to this validation like hey what I'm doing is working you know what I should do

176
00:18:36.88 --> 00:18:42.16
I should keep doing the same thing and that flies against what you just talked about which is

177
00:18:42.16 --> 00:18:48.08
the training and the evolution to think differently from what you did and one of the symbols

178
00:18:48.08 --> 00:18:53.12
things we see this is hey if I if I if I'm a really good at a front-line task go to that particular

179
00:18:53.12 --> 00:18:57.36
task I'm I'm going to get promoted and I'll be the former and if there's other team and why I'm the

180
00:18:57.36 --> 00:19:01.36
former is because I'm really good at the task but my job isn't to do that task anymore my job is

181
00:19:01.36 --> 00:19:05.76
to think strategically and lead this team and I have no skills and no training to do that because

182
00:19:05.76 --> 00:19:11.92
the criteria for getting promoted is being good at the task and that success and that validation

183
00:19:11.92 --> 00:19:17.84
sometimes not always sometimes leads them to a level that they're not capable of doing but the

184
00:19:17.84 --> 00:19:24.08
system doesn't allow you to give them any feedback because when you're a general officer I guess what

185
00:19:25.84 --> 00:19:30.64
I'm a general officer there's there's something that you said that requires a little bit more

186
00:19:30.64 --> 00:19:37.68
exploring and that is you said that when someone gets advanced to you know a general officer or a CEO

187
00:19:39.20 --> 00:19:44.32
in many cases it's based on their successes there's something else it's based on

188
00:19:44.32 --> 00:19:54.32
their lack of failures so you know Dave and I go on deployment Dave does four operations they all go

189
00:19:54.32 --> 00:20:00.40
okay he gets the job done jocco go they were on the same deployment your task you to command

190
00:20:00.40 --> 00:20:07.84
or on the task you commander my task unit does 170 operations 168 of them go really well

191
00:20:07.84 --> 00:20:14.48
and have a huge impact two of them are jacked up who gets promoted who gets promoted this is not

192
00:20:14.48 --> 00:20:20.08
like a theoretical question who gets promoted yeah I'm getting promoted Dave's getting promoted

193
00:20:20.08 --> 00:20:24.24
because I didn't make any headlines for this screw up I didn't cause all this equipment and

194
00:20:24.24 --> 00:20:27.92
God forbid somebody got hurt or killed like we're not we're not having conversation with Dave

195
00:20:27.92 --> 00:20:33.04
Dave no friction no resistance no problem for me no additional paperwork I don't have to

196
00:20:33.04 --> 00:20:38.56
send an investigation out for what happened so yeah and it's not even that extreme it's really

197
00:20:38.56 --> 00:20:43.76
not even that extreme like you're you're you're making it really obvious but it's like hey

198
00:20:45.04 --> 00:20:51.28
you know Dave did four operations they went well good job jocco did a hundred operations

199
00:20:51.84 --> 00:20:59.76
they had a vehicle roll over right they lost a radio and they had a guy get wounded

200
00:20:59.76 --> 00:21:03.92
the guy get wounded it's like people understand that but all you know the vehicle roll over

201
00:21:03.92 --> 00:21:08.64
what kind of what wasn't this it was this really necessary and all of a sudden it's like well you know

202
00:21:08.64 --> 00:21:14.96
Dave kind of keeps it known as clean he did a good job who's getting promoted Davis so

203
00:21:15.92 --> 00:21:21.92
that's disturbing the other thing is you took at these these generals who made it who's

204
00:21:21.92 --> 00:21:27.68
getting promoted the ones that freaking lived how did they live they said oh you know sir maybe

205
00:21:27.68 --> 00:21:32.72
I could go back to the rear and and help you with your strategic planning you know here's another

206
00:21:32.72 --> 00:21:37.92
cup of tea hi really like Dave you know he's I want to bring him back with me makes my ego feel good

207
00:21:38.56 --> 00:21:45.12
so you're a little brown noseer and then you end up getting living through World War One and now

208
00:21:45.12 --> 00:21:50.56
I put you under my wing and along you go yeah and I'm sticking around the army too after world

209
00:21:50.56 --> 00:21:54.32
for a while I can stomach that whole thing as opposed all the guys that came back and like

210
00:21:54.32 --> 00:21:59.92
don't ever call me again yeah I'm that don't don't ever call me again yeah and not to mention

211
00:21:59.92 --> 00:22:04.08
I come back and I'm like hey look I did my time come and go out be an entrepreneur make money and

212
00:22:04.08 --> 00:22:07.60
build a business you're like hey I'm gonna come I'm kind of scared to get out I'll be there go

213
00:22:07.60 --> 00:22:12.72
just stay in here go begin to paycheck three hats in a cot you know I get the uniform

214
00:22:13.28 --> 00:22:15.04
people's treat me with respect I'm good

215
00:22:15.04 --> 00:22:24.96
back to the book to understand the psychology of these reactionary elements in the military

216
00:22:24.96 --> 00:22:30.56
establishment of men who choose to make the army their career painstakingly work their way

217
00:22:30.56 --> 00:22:34.88
up the hierarchy to the highest positions but then behave in such a manner to ensure that if they

218
00:22:34.88 --> 00:22:42.000
are remembered and all will be only for their conservatism we needs must have recourse

219
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.72
to ego psychology thus it seems in that in the present instance military leaders like devil

220
00:22:51.76 --> 00:22:58.72
Montgomery, millen iron side and gork displayed behavior symptomatic of extremely weak

221
00:22:58.72 --> 00:23:05.12
egos in this light their behavior typifies the neurotic paradox in which the individuals need to be

222
00:23:05.12 --> 00:23:13.52
loved breeds on the one hand an insatiable desire for admiration with avoidance of criticism and on the

223
00:23:13.52 --> 00:23:20.32
other hand and equally devouring urge for power and positions of dominance that's weird

224
00:23:21.92 --> 00:23:28.16
the paradox is that these needs inevitably result in behavior so unrealistic as to earn for the victim

225
00:23:28.16 --> 00:23:34.88
the very criticism which he has been striving so hard to avoid consider a few concrete examples of

226
00:23:34.88 --> 00:23:40.96
this syndrome for those who had disappeared of anyone ever learning anything from the events of the

227
00:23:40.96 --> 00:23:47.36
first world war 1933 bought brought a belated gleam of hope with the publication of the Kirk

228
00:23:47.36 --> 00:23:52.80
Committee report which was not uncritical of the high command it could hardly have been otherwise

229
00:23:53.76 --> 00:24:00.16
but there were those for whom preservation of personal reputations counted for more than the need to

230
00:24:00.16 --> 00:24:06.88
avoid the repetition of senseless slaughter to which their direction had given rise this is this is evil

231
00:24:06.88 --> 00:24:12.56
i'm going to say that word this is evil we have a report that comes out that explains what we did wrong

232
00:24:13.12 --> 00:24:17.92
and some people they wanted to preserve their own reputation instead of trying to save future

233
00:24:17.92 --> 00:24:23.60
lives from lessons learned one such was field marshal Montgomery whose immediate response to the report

234
00:24:23.60 --> 00:24:31.04
was to block its dissemination throughout the army while one can wander at a system which would

235
00:24:31.04 --> 00:24:36.48
make it possible for one man to operate such censorship the precise reason for his behaviors by

236
00:24:36.48 --> 00:24:43.84
no means obscure Montgomery as he then was happened to be the chief of staff in the fourth division

237
00:24:44.56 --> 00:24:48.72
during the battle of the song so he's getting ratted out in this report

238
00:24:48.72 --> 00:24:56.88
and he's like puts the sides the report that'd be like if we had the blue on blue in

239
00:24:56.88 --> 00:25:00.16
Ramadhi and I was like hmm hide that with stifle it

240
00:25:03.68 --> 00:25:09.68
our second example is rather more complex concerning as it does that major obstacle to military

241
00:25:09.68 --> 00:25:16.48
development the horse as a noble if uncomprehending factor in military incompetence this animal

242
00:25:16.48 --> 00:25:22.16
was much in evidence between the war this is very interesting if you know anything about horses

243
00:25:22.16 --> 00:25:25.84
upon reflection is hardly resupprising that the horse became the

244
00:25:27.28 --> 00:25:35.12
cina quanon of military life for a thousand years met had found it in it enormous advantages

245
00:25:35.12 --> 00:25:39.04
there was nothing better for transportation and load hauling horses raised morale and enhanced

246
00:25:39.04 --> 00:25:42.72
egos horses took the weight off the feet and enabled people to go to war sitting down when they lay

247
00:25:42.72 --> 00:25:46.16
down you could hide behind them when it was cold you could borrow their warmth and when

248
00:25:46.16 --> 00:25:50.88
they died you could eat them because of the traditionally rural origins of so many army officers

249
00:25:50.88 --> 00:25:54.64
military families horsemanship in the context of sports like hunting

250
00:25:55.68 --> 00:26:00.72
became one of the preferred preferred leisure activities in such sports as polo

251
00:26:00.72 --> 00:26:05.92
pig sticking in an early-aged jelesting not only act out symbolic aspects of real warfare

252
00:26:05.92 --> 00:26:11.04
but are also associated with a higher social class there's little wonder that they should find

253
00:26:11.04 --> 00:26:14.96
so much favor with those who choose the army as a career all in all is not surprising that the

254
00:26:14.96 --> 00:26:18.48
cavalry became the branch of the army with the highest status nor is it surprising

255
00:26:18.48 --> 00:26:24.16
that they should have become the most vehement in the denunciation of the tank which was seen as

256
00:26:24.16 --> 00:26:29.52
an intrusive junior rather than the air and air apparent so they had this long fascination with

257
00:26:29.52 --> 00:26:35.36
the horse they love the horse the people that road horses in the cavalry ended up with a bunch of

258
00:26:35.36 --> 00:26:40.88
you know prestigious positions and high ranking positions and they saw the tank not as like hey

259
00:26:40.88 --> 00:26:46.72
this is what's going to take over the horse it's trying to it's juniors of the horse it's not as good

260
00:26:46.72 --> 00:26:52.96
as the horse nor is it surprising that the desire of the war office to playkate the cavalry

261
00:26:52.96 --> 00:27:00.24
was stronger a lot than logic not only did they veto any expansion of the tank or but under the

262
00:27:00.24 --> 00:27:07.04
direction among Gummery ruled that the new tank brigade should never be reassembled and this in the

263
00:27:07.04 --> 00:27:16.08
mid-1930s with Hitler army to the teeth that's you can't you just you have to have it you have to

264
00:27:16.08 --> 00:27:21.20
be a kind of like a psychopath to do this it there's a level of insanity in there it's like how how

265
00:27:21.20 --> 00:27:26.64
do you look at a horse in a tank and look at him go well yeah you know it's thinking like

266
00:27:27.36 --> 00:27:32.72
the bolt action rifle or the automatic machine gun they fire that one I think we're actually talking

267
00:27:32.72 --> 00:27:39.04
uh sword versus automatic machine gun I'm just trying to force like you gotta go for you gotta go

268
00:27:39.04 --> 00:27:43.60
harder though yeah it's fair point it's just the the depths of crazier said look at that and

269
00:27:43.60 --> 00:27:50.64
and carry was talking about this after the last podcast K dog was talking about this was the culture

270
00:27:50.64 --> 00:27:57.44
of the of the the cavalry and you just said it in there was it a thousand years

271
00:27:57.44 --> 00:28:04.08
people only use an horses and combat like there's a culture inside there that's going to be kind

272
00:28:04.08 --> 00:28:14.56
of hard to break into the tank come on man and it's it votes kind of the same frustration that I

273
00:28:14.56 --> 00:28:18.96
articulate in the very first podcast about the machine no it was before them and when I talked

274
00:28:18.96 --> 00:28:22.16
about the machine gun of how how long does it take for me to watch a machine gun mode down some

275
00:28:22.16 --> 00:28:29.68
of my guys where I go time out stop stop I got this one wrong we need to come up with another plan

276
00:28:30.32 --> 00:28:36.24
as opposed to like no just keep sending them in and do that for four years for four years at the

277
00:28:36.24 --> 00:28:42.56
risk of literally I mean millions of people but but the horse and the tank and even like old pictures

278
00:28:42.56 --> 00:28:46.80
of the war the the crazy thing about war war one tank so like the previous era of tanks that they

279
00:28:46.80 --> 00:28:52.08
be leveraged them they're these giant massive things they're like almost like comedically too big yeah but

280
00:28:52.96 --> 00:28:57.76
you if you would have just put those two side by side like you said there's a level of

281
00:28:57.76 --> 00:29:04.64
psychopathia level of of of of of crazy you got to go no the horse yeah give me the horse

282
00:29:04.64 --> 00:29:10.96
he made the horse dude there was a little bit of maybe even a little bit more than a little

283
00:29:10.96 --> 00:29:18.48
um when when we started using night vision yeah we talked about that we had guys that were like

284
00:29:19.20 --> 00:29:22.96
we'd be wearing night vision on patrol and that's because you shouldn't wear night vision like

285
00:29:22.96 --> 00:29:30.96
what are you insane let's you see in the door yeah you get to fight an enemy that's blind to you yeah

286
00:29:30.96 --> 00:29:37.76
well I've said this and I mean in in aviation I got the fly stealth airplanes like very modern

287
00:29:37.76 --> 00:29:45.04
stealth airplanes and to this day despite the insane advantage the insane advantage there is

288
00:29:45.04 --> 00:29:52.08
still ongoing debate over so whether or not we should have non stealth this is not this is like

289
00:29:52.08 --> 00:29:56.16
in fighters there's reasons I've not said that cargo planes and attack planes like but in this world

290
00:29:56.16 --> 00:30:00.56
of like airplane fighting against another airplane or using airplanes to get into a contested space

291
00:30:00.56 --> 00:30:05.20
they're still an ongoing debate of hey we should just retrofit like really nice legacy airplanes

292
00:30:05.20 --> 00:30:13.60
with cool cool missiles and cool engines and stuff like that my airplane is invisible my airplane is

293
00:30:13.60 --> 00:30:20.08
invisible you will not see it it doesn't matter how fast you can go or how much gas you can carry

294
00:30:20.08 --> 00:30:26.32
or how cool your weapon is you're going to lose how much longer till pilots are not doing this job

295
00:30:26.32 --> 00:30:32.32
fighter pilots I think we are one generation away my opinion is that the next generation which

296
00:30:32.32 --> 00:30:36.80
what scary is like it's much sooner it's not like 40 years from now the next generation of airplanes

297
00:30:36.80 --> 00:30:40.64
are going to come out in the next 15 20 years and there's going to be no pilots no no I think this

298
00:30:40.64 --> 00:30:44.72
general like they're building this now they're designing and building it now so this yeah and so

299
00:30:44.72 --> 00:30:50.56
technology one of the drawbacks of airplanes like from conception to development and building it

300
00:30:50.56 --> 00:30:55.76
takes a long time so this plane has been on the drawing board for 10 years and this is what happens

301
00:30:55.76 --> 00:31:00.40
when you got the military industrial complex because we gave this to Elon Musk dude I got your

302
00:31:00.40 --> 00:31:07.44
fighter pilot electric and to his dismay he probably wants and things and understands that

303
00:31:07.44 --> 00:31:12.88
we should be a generation head but be that as a may even with that I think we've got one more

304
00:31:12.88 --> 00:31:20.16
airplane in us with a person inside that's my opinion and you know even with that it is met with

305
00:31:20.16 --> 00:31:27.28
so much resistance so much institutional resistance yeah that's which is crazy right because you take

306
00:31:27.28 --> 00:31:32.16
the pilot out of the plane and and the other thing is you can you don't have to fight a plane

307
00:31:32.16 --> 00:31:39.84
with a plane you can fight a plane with 19 unmanned drones that have that cost a fraction of the

308
00:31:39.84 --> 00:31:45.60
price and can maneuver and don't have to worry about the stupid human in there screwing things up

309
00:31:45.60 --> 00:31:49.36
and that's why that story of the naval officer going you should buy all these tanks

310
00:31:50.08 --> 00:31:54.64
because he's got no yes no personal vested interest in the tank he's not inside that whole thing

311
00:31:54.64 --> 00:31:58.88
he's not a cavalry guy writing horses he's like I'm over here in a boat I'm just telling you

312
00:31:58.88 --> 00:32:04.88
for my vantage point it's not even close by this thing buy him all right now because he's

313
00:32:05.68 --> 00:32:09.84
he's detached he's just like oh no I'm not this is not for my personal game I'm not going to be

314
00:32:09.84 --> 00:32:14.96
in that tank around that horse I'm just telling you from from over here it's not it's not even close just

315
00:32:14.96 --> 00:32:22.64
do this because he sees it from a perspective and that's what I think that's where that that is

316
00:32:22.64 --> 00:32:26.96
it the level of frustration of hearing this is really hardest because hey you're there

317
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.04
I said both actor rifle and machine gun and like go harder to you're harder so you know

318
00:32:33.04 --> 00:32:38.000
which is like a sling shot and a heavy machine gun automatic heavy machine gun that's how big the

319
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.52
gap is and the only way to not see the machine gun is to be so invested and so committed to your

320
00:32:43.52 --> 00:32:48.96
point of view that just like we said last time you will dismiss the truth because it doesn't

321
00:32:48.96 --> 00:32:54.16
align with your preconceived outcome that you've created in your head which is probably to some

322
00:32:54.16 --> 00:33:01.44
degree the definition of being a psychotic a psychopath by the way there weren't just anti-tank

323
00:33:02.24 --> 00:33:07.68
and this gets in the Dave Berk territory there are anti-aircrafts too here we go for once the

324
00:33:07.68 --> 00:33:13.28
for once the usual rival between the two older arms sank beneath their mutual dislike of the new

325
00:33:13.28 --> 00:33:19.36
upstart if anything the admiral's waxed more rather more negative about aeroplanes than they did

326
00:33:19.36 --> 00:33:24.32
than did the generals whose minds as we have seen were already discomforted by the issue of tanks

327
00:33:24.32 --> 00:33:30.16
as mechanization threatened horses so aircraft threatened battleships but unlike horses and military

328
00:33:30.16 --> 00:33:35.84
minds battleships were only the last succession of obstacles to progressive naval thinking before

329
00:33:35.84 --> 00:33:41.52
battleships had been wood and before that sale each were link wishing each were licorsement

330
00:33:41.52 --> 00:33:48.24
and transition had been bitterly resented heavily opposed and productive of such irrational thinking

331
00:33:48.24 --> 00:33:56.32
as tends to occur when dearly loved objects have been renounced. When this is I've been

332
00:33:56.32 --> 00:34:01.52
referencing this a lot when I talk to people. When there was talk of iron replacing wood in the

333
00:34:01.52 --> 00:34:06.32
construction of ship one admiral was heard to remark that the idea was preposterous since iron was

334
00:34:06.32 --> 00:34:12.40
heavier than water the ships would be bound to sink on this issue has been calculated that and this

335
00:34:12.40 --> 00:34:20.40
is fascinating of the 20 major technological developments which lie between the first marine engine

336
00:34:20.40 --> 00:34:27.76
and the Polaris submarine the admiral's admiral team machine has discouraged delayed obstruction

337
00:34:27.76 --> 00:34:36.40
obstructed or positively rejected 17 17 out of 20 the essential and necessary incorporation of these

338
00:34:36.40 --> 00:34:42.32
developments in the structure of modernization has been achieved by individual and sometimes

339
00:34:42.32 --> 00:34:49.52
undisciplined officers by political industrial and industrial pressures or and most frequently

340
00:34:49.52 --> 00:34:56.48
by their successful adoption in rival navies so if you think I'm going to figure out some kind of

341
00:34:56.48 --> 00:35:01.36
I'm going to figure out what that list is it's like iron to wood and then getting rid of sales

342
00:35:01.36 --> 00:35:05.92
for steam and then from steam to what you know diesel and then from and there was people resisted

343
00:35:05.92 --> 00:35:10.56
every single 17 out of 20 those advancements there was resistance in nuclear reactor on a boat

344
00:35:11.20 --> 00:35:16.32
imagine the world does think you've ever heard right when doing a submarine are you insane

345
00:35:16.32 --> 00:35:23.04
can't be done can't be done as for battleships whose future usefulness and indeed

346
00:35:23.04 --> 00:35:28.88
very existence was threatened by the advent of aircraft quote two most admels the the respective

347
00:35:28.88 --> 00:35:34.000
value of battleships and aircraft was not basically a technological issue but more in the nature

348
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:41.12
of a spiritual issue don't they cherished the battlefield with a religious fervor as an article

349
00:35:41.12 --> 00:35:46.16
of belief defying all scientific examination the blindness of hard-headed sailors to realities

350
00:35:46.16 --> 00:35:51.68
that were obvious to a dispassionate observer is the only explicable through is only explicable

351
00:35:51.68 --> 00:35:56.48
through the through understanding the place that quote ships of the line filled their hearts

352
00:35:58.16 --> 00:36:04.32
a battleship had long been to an admiral what a cathedral is to a bishop and you can't walk away from that

353
00:36:05.60 --> 00:36:09.84
I don't know if there is an equivalent in the teams if there is let me know but

354
00:36:11.36 --> 00:36:20.000
that description is is is is beautiful because in aviation you literally fall in love with your

355
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.56
airplane like it's a person like it's a human being and and the degree to which you cannot see the

356
00:36:26.56 --> 00:36:32.48
truth is I would say on part of the degree that you can't see the flaws in your own children

357
00:36:33.12 --> 00:36:39.12
hey hey jocco you got an ugly baby no I don't that baby is perfect from head to toe everything

358
00:36:39.12 --> 00:36:43.12
about this thing unique and perfect and special and I can't go and go hey man your kids got some

359
00:36:43.12 --> 00:36:50.56
flaws here because that is the degree to which pilots fall in love with the equipment matches what

360
00:36:50.56 --> 00:36:56.16
he described or like the cathedral that's not an exaggeration and you will see people make these

361
00:36:56.96 --> 00:37:03.20
decisions based on irrational physical attachment to a piece of equipment thank God I flew a

362
00:37:03.20 --> 00:37:07.04
bunch of different airplanes so I kind of like sort of fell out in love with my first girlfriend that

363
00:37:07.04 --> 00:37:14.72
first airplane but I still kind of look back finally go man I really love the airplane and to be told

364
00:37:14.72 --> 00:37:20.48
hey this thing that you have is flawed like deeply deeply flawed and generationally behind

365
00:37:20.48 --> 00:37:24.80
weren't supposed to be and the end rather than sort of an object or yeah you're right there's some

366
00:37:24.80 --> 00:37:30.32
things about this it aren't very good oftentimes you get just this hyper irrational emotional response

367
00:37:30.32 --> 00:37:34.08
like you're talking about like I'm not trying to be critical of your this is a machine right

368
00:37:34.08 --> 00:37:39.04
we're not right I love with the machine are we well it's pretty spot on yeah that's like when you

369
00:37:39.04 --> 00:37:42.64
come up with a plan and you fall in love with your own plan and I'm like hey Dave not quite sure

370
00:37:42.64 --> 00:37:48.24
about your plan and this thing we were talking about talking about speaking of emotional

371
00:37:48.24 --> 00:37:53.60
depot detachments it was such strong emotional attachment that led admirals to deceive

372
00:37:53.60 --> 00:37:58.72
their political masters you can it doesn't get need more horrible than this I guess it does but

373
00:37:58.72 --> 00:38:03.84
the practical issue is whether or not battleships could defend themselves against aircraft

374
00:38:04.56 --> 00:38:11.28
having formed the opinion that they could the Admiral the Admiralty decided to prove its point in 1936

375
00:38:12.08 --> 00:38:17.28
while aircraft production by the Axis Powers was getting into top gear the king was invited

376
00:38:17.28 --> 00:38:22.40
to a demonstration in which naval ships would attempt to shoot down a radio controlled queen bee

377
00:38:22.40 --> 00:38:28.16
target aircraft unfortunately the demonstration did not go well despite the fact that the

378
00:38:28.16 --> 00:38:35.44
plane was flimited to flying 80 miles an hour and flew up and down without jinking while the

379
00:38:35.44 --> 00:38:41.20
ships were given a running start on a parallel course thereby reducing the speed differential to

380
00:38:41.20 --> 00:38:49.28
something approaching 50 miles an hour not a hit was scored dismayed but resourceful the

381
00:38:49.28 --> 00:38:54.96
admiral's played their last card deliberately crashing the radio controlled plane into the sea

382
00:38:54.96 --> 00:39:00.56
thereby proving at considerable cost of the British taxpayer that planes are no match for the

383
00:39:00.56 --> 00:39:07.68
battleship when these are in the right hands that's like an act of trees that is an act that's an

384
00:39:07.68 --> 00:39:16.000
act of treason I hate imagining the actual scene where you're like the remote control guy

385
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.80
and I'm over your shoulder and I do it yet no hey put that thing in the water and it was like

386
00:39:20.80 --> 00:39:26.40
seriously like putting the water you know like that event had to occur like in real time

387
00:39:26.40 --> 00:39:29.84
whether there's something like hey this isn't going the way we plan let sabotage our

388
00:39:29.84 --> 00:39:34.88
experiment to prove our point that we've already predetermined which is planes aren't as good as ships

389
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.68
crash that crash that drone will like we're like I Roger that's right and you like

390
00:39:39.68 --> 00:39:43.52
whatever you do you put that thing in the water go see look what happened yeah so let's just

391
00:39:43.52 --> 00:39:50.32
like essentially on a big scale like what you always say you risk like some people will

392
00:39:50.32 --> 00:39:55.92
sabotage your plan because they want their plan to be they want to prove you know the

393
00:39:55.92 --> 00:40:00.40
buck or you know you guys roll player whatever or if you approach the guy in the wrong way

394
00:40:00.96 --> 00:40:04.40
he'll be like yeah I'll do your plan if you shove the plan down like I threw mm-hmm right and

395
00:40:04.40 --> 00:40:08.40
then they're like okay I'll carry out your plan and then they might intentionally sabotage it to

396
00:40:08.40 --> 00:40:12.24
prove to you that hey your plan sucks therefore we should have went with my plan yeah I

397
00:40:12.24 --> 00:40:22.40
parallel sort of but um this is actually just like like treasonous right to just straight up

398
00:40:23.28 --> 00:40:30.56
why because you want to protect your little fife dumb and you are putting the security of your

399
00:40:30.56 --> 00:40:38.96
nation in complete jeopardy because you're so arrogant and stuck in your old ways and in love

400
00:40:38.96 --> 00:40:48.24
with your piece of equipment that's like that's treason that's treason yeah and it's it's also

401
00:40:48.24 --> 00:40:56.08
gonna result in your your people dying because the test is actually designed to go hey let's see if

402
00:40:56.08 --> 00:41:00.16
we can learn some stuff here hey it turns out this airplane thing is a good thing we should it and

403
00:41:00.88 --> 00:41:06.64
rather than get to the outcome you you will sabotage the outcome to get what you want which is I want

404
00:41:06.64 --> 00:41:11.68
to show you my my battleship is still supreme and the result is you're killing your own people

405
00:41:11.68 --> 00:41:15.68
it is not gonna happen for five years or whatever the timing of that was but it's gonna happen

406
00:41:15.68 --> 00:41:20.16
and we're gonna kill hundreds of thousands of people as a result of that and that's the treason

407
00:41:21.92 --> 00:41:26.64
I'm trying to remember I had something to happen one time where I was testing some GPS

408
00:41:28.56 --> 00:41:34.64
full and and it was supposed to be waterproof they're like hey this board this GPS is waterproof

409
00:41:34.64 --> 00:41:40.48
you don't need to waterproof and I was like trust me how is it like any e4 and e5 and the

410
00:41:40.48 --> 00:41:46.56
sealed teams going over the beach all the time I was a freaking expert on what was waterproof and

411
00:41:46.56 --> 00:41:50.24
what wasn't and I looked at this thing and I was like you're saying this thing is waterproof

412
00:41:50.24 --> 00:41:54.88
like that's what you're saying and they're like yep and I said no but how do you how should I

413
00:41:54.88 --> 00:41:59.76
prepare it they're like you don't need to and I was like you want me to test this thing and they're like

414
00:41:59.76 --> 00:42:06.24
yeah it's waterproof and I said okay cool shit was not waterproof you know like not even close

415
00:42:06.24 --> 00:42:13.04
and brought gave them back they're flooded out crappy GPS but there was there was sort of like

416
00:42:13.04 --> 00:42:19.12
indications of like you know what did you do you know did you open it well and I was like

417
00:42:19.12 --> 00:42:23.52
not an open any of these things it's not waterproof but you can see that's the kind of test where

418
00:42:23.52 --> 00:42:27.68
someone goes hey put it in a plastic bag and then say it's waterproof you know you got some

419
00:42:27.68 --> 00:42:33.68
contractor that's going to sell all these GPS's to to naval special warfare not on my freaking

420
00:42:33.68 --> 00:42:39.68
watch you're not this shit is a joke well the quilt any potential concern just that scenario of

421
00:42:39.68 --> 00:42:44.72
like that word that pre-wold or two you know battleship airplane British thing where it was just like

422
00:42:44.72 --> 00:42:48.72
hey we're just going to sabotage and and just false about the results I never saw anything to

423
00:42:48.72 --> 00:42:54.64
that degree I saw some resistance for sure but I never saw anybody or ever hurt anybody hey

424
00:42:54.64 --> 00:43:01.12
falsify the report sabotage the plan so just so people realize like I in my experience and I

425
00:43:01.12 --> 00:43:06.000
had some interesting things happened in my career I never saw that I'm sure I don't think I have either

426
00:43:08.24 --> 00:43:12.88
yeah I'll have to I'll have to think on that one but I'd probably would have stood out so much yeah

427
00:43:12.88 --> 00:43:17.60
I mean somebody over my shoulder saying hey put that thing in a waterproof bag and call it good like

428
00:43:17.60 --> 00:43:21.84
what do you know I would have never done that thousand years yeah I love the image

429
00:43:21.84 --> 00:43:26.000
willing to put that Joan in the water sir what do you mean crash it immediately and tell everybody

430
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.76
got shot down it looks like we crash some drones as a matter of fact we were in uh we're going through

431
00:43:32.96 --> 00:43:37.52
through urban combat training and task in the bruiser and we're supposed to be using these

432
00:43:37.52 --> 00:43:44.64
drones and everything hey I see it was in one of the lace a license was like a drone pilot

433
00:43:45.28 --> 00:43:49.76
and whatever he was doing like he's like all right I'm going you know we're flying it going to

434
00:43:49.76 --> 00:43:54.64
look at the target and he's he brings tries to bring it back and this thing came in it like

435
00:43:54.64 --> 00:43:59.20
why don't I'll fast those things go what would be a realistic speed for a drone 50 knots

436
00:43:59.84 --> 00:44:07.04
this thing comes in at 50 knots it just way lays into a tree and of course they're like you know how's

437
00:44:07.04 --> 00:44:12.48
that drone working out I'd be like that drone sucks and the advancement on drones between that time

438
00:44:12.48 --> 00:44:18.40
frame 2005 and now is like night and day but if I would have been setting up the report or whoever would have

439
00:44:18.40 --> 00:44:23.60
been something yeah these things are great no we'd be like this thing sucks this thing sucks make it

440
00:44:23.60 --> 00:44:29.68
better that's what they did so thankfully listen we also didn't like falsify stuff all right

441
00:44:30.88 --> 00:44:36.40
those that's that's that's now we're moving into the second world war the pre the pre the

442
00:44:36.40 --> 00:44:42.24
in between war period is over nothing learned nothing figured out no no one taking blame

443
00:44:42.24 --> 00:44:49.60
responsibility for anything second world war there's a quote in here from La Del Hart the German

444
00:44:49.60 --> 00:44:55.20
success in May 1940 could easily have been prevented but for the opportunities presented to them by

445
00:44:55.20 --> 00:45:01.04
the allied blunders blunders that were largely due to the prevalence of outer-date ideas

446
00:45:03.44 --> 00:45:07.60
after an appalling start in which the allies were out fought out maneuvered and outstripped

447
00:45:07.60 --> 00:45:11.28
in the quality of their military thinking and equipment the second world war produced a

448
00:45:11.28 --> 00:45:15.84
biggest transition in military competence since though days of Wellington it was born of necessity

449
00:45:15.84 --> 00:45:22.08
and maybe said to have dated from Dunkirk this jolt to 100 years of military

450
00:45:22.08 --> 00:45:28.08
monitoring and 20 years of blind complacency achieved 3 ends within a space of days it shattered

451
00:45:28.08 --> 00:45:34.16
many long-held dearly loved illusions about the nature of modern war it hasten the eclipse of the

452
00:45:34.16 --> 00:45:41.52
old the reactionary the untalented finally by rendering the armory temporary impotent Dunkirk put

453
00:45:41.52 --> 00:45:48.24
the most junior service in the center of the stage Dave Burke is excited now the first time

454
00:45:48.24 --> 00:45:54.08
the continued existence of the army and navy became totally dependent upon their protection

455
00:45:54.08 --> 00:46:02.48
by the RAF look at this smile on this guy over here as for the bad start this was a legacy of

456
00:46:02.48 --> 00:46:08.000
factors that touched on the previous chapters rigidity of thinking over confidence resulting from

457
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.88
a pathetic belief and antiquated methods of warfare and refusal to accept that enemy intentions may

458
00:46:14.88 --> 00:46:21.04
confound the armchair profits the following examples from the liberal hearts history of

459
00:46:21.04 --> 00:46:27.52
second war illustrate these shortcomings on January 10, 1940 a German aircraft carrying the liais on

460
00:46:27.52 --> 00:46:33.68
officer of the second air fleet lost its way in crash landed in Belgium by an extraordinary chance

461
00:46:33.68 --> 00:46:38.24
the officer was in possession of the complete operational plan for Germany's attack on the west

462
00:46:38.96 --> 00:46:44.32
did you hear what I just said by extraordinary chance the officer was in possession of the

463
00:46:44.32 --> 00:46:50.000
complete operational plan for Germany's attack on the west he tried to burn the plan but failed

464
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.04
to complete this task before he was captured in this way its contents became known to the allies

465
00:46:55.04 --> 00:47:01.28
Hitler's response was to devise a new plan which involved attacking France through the Rden's

466
00:47:01.28 --> 00:47:07.04
rather than through Belgium as originally intended this episode was damaging to the allies for

467
00:47:07.04 --> 00:47:13.76
two reasons first firstly in the belief that the captured plan was a deliberate deception they failed

468
00:47:13.76 --> 00:47:20.48
to modify their own plans secondly contrary to advice received years earlier they clung to the belief

469
00:47:20.48 --> 00:47:25.76
that the wooded area of the Rden's was impossible to tanks as a result the strongest allied

470
00:47:25.76 --> 00:47:30.08
force remained poised for attack through Belgium while the Germans suffered little resistance

471
00:47:30.08 --> 00:47:37.60
to their outflanking drive through the Rden's here's another one the French they'll possessing

472
00:47:37.60 --> 00:47:42.80
many tanks which were as good as if not better than those the Germans were steadfast and

473
00:47:42.80 --> 00:47:48.80
their belief that horse to cavalry could destroy German armor in the Rden's for this reason they

474
00:47:48.80 --> 00:47:53.12
refused to accept the suggestion that fel trees might be used to delay the German advance like

475
00:47:53.12 --> 00:47:57.60
the poles they were sadly disillusioned about the outcome of a conflict between horse and tanks

476
00:47:58.80 --> 00:48:05.12
that's the poles and the French both making the assessment that hey you got tanks but we got horses

477
00:48:07.76 --> 00:48:13.04
the British retreat from the Gazale line in 1942 which resulted in the loss of towbrook

478
00:48:13.04 --> 00:48:20.40
followed by a headlong flight back into Egypt was the second worst disaster of the war after

479
00:48:20.40 --> 00:48:28.08
Dunkirk tobrook cost Britain 35 thousand casualties and an enormous loss in ground and material

480
00:48:28.08 --> 00:48:35.84
why did it happen inadequate general ship the army commander major general Neil Richie a fine-looking man

481
00:48:35.84 --> 00:48:44.32
has been described by his contemporaries in ways strikingly resembling of elf and stone raglan and boulder

482
00:48:44.32 --> 00:48:50.08
here's what his contemporaries had to say about him Richie was all hey wire by then all for counter-attacking

483
00:48:50.08 --> 00:48:54.64
in this direction one day and another the next optimistic and not and trying not to believe we

484
00:48:54.64 --> 00:48:59.20
had taken a knock when I reported the state of the first armor division to him at a time when I was

485
00:48:59.20 --> 00:49:03.92
planning to use it for a counter attack he flew to see me and almost took the view that I was being

486
00:49:03.92 --> 00:49:10.96
subversive another one general richie had a great air of the sizeiveness it was really rather

487
00:49:10.96 --> 00:49:17.52
indecisive according to the same core commander he quote had a tendency to ask your advice

488
00:49:17.52 --> 00:49:22.16
and having received it acted in the opposite way here's another one richie is not sufficiently

489
00:49:22.16 --> 00:49:30.64
quick-witted or imaginative another one a fine robust looking man with charm and manner but no aura

490
00:49:30.64 --> 00:49:37.12
and finally confident and decisive in his speech but one did not always feel he was quite

491
00:49:37.12 --> 00:49:40.96
so confident and decisive in his mind that's another thing I talked about that I think of the first one

492
00:49:40.96 --> 00:49:47.60
there's act that you learn you learn to kind of raise your voice a little bit you learn to project

493
00:49:47.60 --> 00:49:52.88
you learn to fero your eyebrows a little bit and you say hey listen Burke I love doing that right

494
00:49:52.88 --> 00:49:56.64
because it's something that we experience so much in the military listen up Burke hey

495
00:49:56.64 --> 00:50:01.20
I don't need your input right now look we need to make a move Burke you know like that thing

496
00:50:01.20 --> 00:50:06.48
people learn that in the military you learn how to act like that and eventually you can learn

497
00:50:06.48 --> 00:50:14.24
not a high behind that see that all the time so and people get fooled by civilians get fooled

498
00:50:14.24 --> 00:50:18.72
like by that but like it's going out of style I mean that's what they're looking for they're

499
00:50:18.72 --> 00:50:25.44
looking for the type cast kernel the type cast general that first is brow sits up straight with a good

500
00:50:25.44 --> 00:50:31.20
posture and then speaks in a clear effective manner that people are going to listen to

501
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.12
and the politicians love to take that guy and put him out there to put out the word you know

502
00:50:37.12 --> 00:50:40.08
well you know what I'm saying they did they take that guy that put him out there

503
00:50:41.20 --> 00:50:45.36
hey we know what we got willing willink willink you know like put on an act

504
00:50:45.36 --> 00:50:49.52
no one's gonna mess with willing but willing on this down put willing on the stand

505
00:50:49.52 --> 00:50:56.32
willing gets and he puts his uniform on freaking puts his shoulders back chest out and then

506
00:50:56.32 --> 00:51:00.88
says I'm going to tell you this one time here's how it is going to happen boom people aren't

507
00:51:00.88 --> 00:51:08.72
questioning that fast forward a little bit under the ineffectual leadership of this big

508
00:51:08.72 --> 00:51:13.20
kindly courteous on imagine if apparently complacent yet occasionally touchy general the army

509
00:51:13.20 --> 00:51:17.92
suffered a decline in organization discipline and drive if he came flabby instead of taught

510
00:51:17.92 --> 00:51:23.84
sluggish instead of agile once again that fatal amalgam of overconfidence and under

511
00:51:23.84 --> 00:51:30.08
estimation of the enemy produced a doling of military endeavor rommel himself in his diary

512
00:51:30.08 --> 00:51:38.40
ascribed success to the British pre-delection for frontal assaults brave but costly charges by

513
00:51:38.40 --> 00:51:44.32
small groups in which the attackers banged their heads time and time again against the whole down

514
00:51:44.32 --> 00:51:54.08
German panzers hold down yeah let's do a frontal assault against a tank yep and a whole that's

515
00:51:54.08 --> 00:51:59.76
yeah that's whole down the meaning meaning they've positioned themselves where the whole is you can't

516
00:51:59.76 --> 00:52:05.36
see the tank you can only see the turret that's whole down echo tross hold down defilei you

517
00:52:05.36 --> 00:52:10.08
park that thing in a little berm in a little ravine and you can't see it only thing you see is

518
00:52:10.08 --> 00:52:14.80
this like the gun yeah and guess when you see the turret you know about five seconds before it

519
00:52:14.80 --> 00:52:21.68
lights you up yeah just walking right up on that thing it's hard to picture that because you know

520
00:52:22.32 --> 00:52:28.000
you know the story of the hey the French gonna dig this hey you know what you should do a deeper

521
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.84
longer wider trench and a force that's impossible by armor like that's the plan yeah

522
00:52:33.84 --> 00:52:38.56
hey what do we learn hey I got an idea hey remember the trench we didn't older one not good enough

523
00:52:38.56 --> 00:52:42.64
let's dig a deeper trench and they're 100% sure that the armor can't go through this forest so

524
00:52:43.28 --> 00:52:48.40
we're good and we all know that story so you're just waiting to hear this this be revealed

525
00:52:48.40 --> 00:52:55.92
which is the idea of hey the horses you know this this this this force is impossible by equipment

526
00:52:56.40 --> 00:53:00.64
so you don't you need some horses yeah you know what I had when I had some trees when I had been

527
00:53:00.64 --> 00:53:06.96
miligan on from from his book um by water beneath the walls one of the interesting things the

528
00:53:06.96 --> 00:53:13.52
like the marine's had issues at Tarra and their solution like hey we are tracks didn't make it through

529
00:53:13.52 --> 00:53:18.08
and some of our Marines didn't make it to the beach because they hit um you know hit the the

530
00:53:18.08 --> 00:53:25.04
reef 800 meters out marine solution was okay you guess what real simple we need more more Marines

531
00:53:25.60 --> 00:53:32.64
and more tracks we need you know 80 tracks to make it through and half them don't make it cool

532
00:53:32.64 --> 00:53:41.28
160's the number yeah and the the the the navy was like how about we go and you know try and

533
00:53:41.28 --> 00:53:45.92
figure out where those reefs are hence you deities

534
00:53:48.72 --> 00:53:56.000
if you didn't listen that podcast I think it's 298 with Ben Milligan and get that book get that book

535
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.96
that freaking book is outstanding by water beneath the waves talk about a

536
00:54:00.96 --> 00:54:06.88
going into depth and figuring out and understanding why things are the way they are it's an outstanding book

537
00:54:08.64 --> 00:54:14.24
from the standpoint of human behavior human feelings leadership and decision making the events of

538
00:54:14.24 --> 00:54:22.64
1942 in North Africa exemplify in microcosm the major causes of military incompetence underneath his

539
00:54:22.64 --> 00:54:30.72
robust exterior richy like boulder before him an elephant stone before him lack to self confidence

540
00:54:30.72 --> 00:54:35.84
and seem more concerned with proving himself to himself than with prosecuting the war

541
00:54:37.12 --> 00:54:43.92
the presiding over interminable committee meetings through which the army was run the seeking of

542
00:54:43.92 --> 00:54:50.56
advice and then not taking it and the disingenuous way in which he managed to convince the commander

543
00:54:50.56 --> 00:54:55.68
and chief that he was protecting tobrook wall in reality leaving it to the mercy of the Germans

544
00:54:55.68 --> 00:55:02.80
are the actions of a man beset by inter doubts these doubts were skillfully but not perfectly

545
00:55:02.80 --> 00:55:08.08
concealed by his often inappropriate facade of monumental complacency

546
00:55:08.08 --> 00:55:24.80
now we go to sing a poor chapter 11 one can sum up by saying that those responsible for the

547
00:55:24.80 --> 00:55:30.80
conduct of the land campaign in Malaya committed every conceivable blunder major general woodburn

548
00:55:30.80 --> 00:55:37.84
curbsing a poor the chain of disaster in the nine weeks between early December 1941 and mid-February

549
00:55:37.84 --> 00:55:44.80
1942 the impregnable force fortress of Singapore Europe's gateway to the east with its thriving

550
00:55:44.80 --> 00:55:49.12
city huge naval dockyard and strategic vital airfields fell lock stock and barrel into the hands

551
00:55:49.12 --> 00:55:55.04
of the Japanese the invasion of this island stronghold the complete defeat of the combined

552
00:55:55.04 --> 00:55:59.84
British and Australian garrison with its army navy and air force units was the ultimate

553
00:55:59.84 --> 00:56:06.80
unconditional surrender of the whole area was so rapid that even the Japanese were staggered indeed one

554
00:56:06.80 --> 00:56:12.96
almost might say non-plossed by the ease speed and enormity of their success

555
00:56:15.20 --> 00:56:19.36
in the long run the results of this disaster may be deemed incalculable

556
00:56:20.16 --> 00:56:26.64
the myth of European supremacy over ageatic peoples was exploded forever and the prestige of

557
00:56:26.64 --> 00:56:30.88
competence of the British military endeavor in the eyes of the world in general and American

558
00:56:30.88 --> 00:56:36.24
particular were damaged beyond repair in the short run Britain lost her last and strongest

559
00:56:36.24 --> 00:56:42.08
foothold in the far east and a polling set back for the global war effort we lost thousands of

560
00:56:42.08 --> 00:56:48.16
lives both military and civilian but worse perhaps than the loss of life the military debacle

561
00:56:48.16 --> 00:56:54.72
condemned thousands more to three and a half years in Japanese internment camps

562
00:56:54.72 --> 00:57:00.64
finally the economic loss ran into hundreds of millions of pounds we forfitted elaborate and

563
00:57:00.64 --> 00:57:06.16
expensive dock installations naval and other engineering facilities military stores fuel the major

564
00:57:06.16 --> 00:57:11.12
port for exporting urgently needed rubber and two new first class battleships

565
00:57:12.32 --> 00:57:17.68
most of these material assets fell virtually intact into the hands of the enemy

566
00:57:17.68 --> 00:57:27.60
thus in effect doubling their value the value of their loss to the allies like other cases we have

567
00:57:27.60 --> 00:57:33.36
discussed that of Singapore is essentially a human problem a product of human behavior human

568
00:57:33.36 --> 00:57:38.72
intellect human character in human error no explanation in terms of geography climate

569
00:57:38.72 --> 00:57:42.48
broad political or military considerations can possibly do justice to the facts

570
00:57:42.48 --> 00:57:48.88
at bottom and at the top we are confronted with issues that are primarily psychological

571
00:57:48.88 --> 00:57:53.52
and which only a reduction to psychological principles can possibly explain

572
00:57:54.16 --> 00:58:02.64
so this freaking disaster unfolds in Singapore a disaster and as you're going to see it's

573
00:58:02.64 --> 00:58:07.20
not about who was smart and it's not about like the military situation it's the freaking

574
00:58:07.20 --> 00:58:15.12
psycho pathology of the leaders let us state the problem in terms of a number of questions why

575
00:58:15.12 --> 00:58:20.000
was the impregnable fortress planned and serviced in such a way that while presenting apparently

576
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.92
formidable defenses on its southern side its back and northern sure was no more of a resistance

577
00:58:25.92 --> 00:58:32.16
than would be invader than the back of Bournemouth why was there an almost total lack of coordination

578
00:58:32.16 --> 00:58:36.56
and cooperation between those who had been entrusted with the job of defending the island why

579
00:58:36.56 --> 00:58:43.28
was it clear that the Japanese could and would assault the island from its northern side was

580
00:58:43.28 --> 00:58:48.96
nothing done to erect defenses in their path why did the general officer commanding Singapore

581
00:58:49.52 --> 00:58:55.12
lieutenant general person of all ignore the urgent advice of his subordinate Brigadier Simpson

582
00:58:55.12 --> 00:59:01.28
and of his superior general wavel to implement these defenses why on the one hand was so

583
00:59:01.28 --> 00:59:06.48
little done to protect the civilian population against air raids and on the other so much done to

584
00:59:06.48 --> 00:59:11.20
prevent their knowing the true facts of the situation as these unfolded why did general

585
00:59:11.20 --> 00:59:15.12
personal persistent believing the Japanese would attack from the northeast when confronted with

586
00:59:15.12 --> 00:59:20.000
overwhelming evidence that their assault would come from the northwest why did the officer

587
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.60
commanding the Australian forces on the island forbid his troops to escape while secretly plotting

588
00:59:25.60 --> 00:59:32.000
his own get away from the island finally and perhaps greatest of greatest interest how did the

589
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:37.28
men who could perpetrate such colossal errors of judgment ever reach a position where this was possible

590
00:59:39.84 --> 00:59:47.12
it's quite the setup in 1925 there's a protracted and acrimonious argument between the army

591
00:59:47.12 --> 00:59:51.60
navy and air force chiefs as the housing report should be defended while the older services

592
00:59:51.60 --> 00:59:55.60
press for fortifications and heavy fixed guns for repelling attack from seward

593
00:59:55.60 --> 00:59:59.76
trenchered for the RAF advocated for a large force of aircraft to repelling attack before it could

594
00:59:59.76 --> 01:00:04.24
become come within range of the island need this to say the army in the navy won their case

595
01:00:04.24 --> 01:00:09.20
at the expense of more junior service heavy fixed armaments armaments became the order of the

596
01:00:09.20 --> 01:00:14.96
day this debate in which the RAF had conceded defeat had three unfortunate consequences

597
01:00:14.96 --> 01:00:21.12
firstly the island was left exposed and undefended on its northern side second we seen your army

598
01:00:21.12 --> 01:00:25.84
commanders from that time on stubbornly clung to the dog with that no Japanese would ever advance

599
01:00:25.84 --> 01:00:31.44
on Singapore down the Malay peninsula finally the bitter inner service quarrel which ensued resulted

600
01:00:31.44 --> 01:00:40.72
in an almost total lack of coordination between the three services for future reference

601
01:00:42.24 --> 01:00:42.88
let me say this

602
01:00:42.88 --> 01:00:52.56
day view have a platoon in europeal tune there's a two different let's call them clicks

603
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.92
and they have two different ideas of what you should be focused on and how you should operate

604
01:00:59.44 --> 01:01:05.20
and what you do is you sort of negotiate a piece between these two clicks and you sort of

605
01:01:05.20 --> 01:01:08.96
compromise and you figure out hey like we'll do a little bit of this click and a little bit of that

606
01:01:08.96 --> 01:01:15.36
click and you kind of you kind of bring these forces to a compromise you get them working together

607
01:01:15.36 --> 01:01:20.32
you get them to like take these things that they could be arguing about you you give one here

608
01:01:20.32 --> 01:01:24.96
and give the other side one here and so you you end up with a team that although they're not

609
01:01:24.96 --> 01:01:30.88
perfectly in sync they're at least sort of working together

610
01:01:30.88 --> 01:01:40.32
my platoon I have two clicks and what I do is I get mad at them because they don't get along

611
01:01:40.88 --> 01:01:45.52
and then I agree with one of the clicks actually a little bit more and so I give them favoritism

612
01:01:45.52 --> 01:01:52.16
and now we end up with this you know head buddy who's got a better platoon right so

613
01:01:52.16 --> 01:02:01.28
if you think about this in a large strategic view and you look at a place called the United

614
01:02:01.28 --> 01:02:09.44
States of America right now and you look at how miraculously or strangely we've become

615
01:02:09.44 --> 01:02:17.20
super divisive about all kinds of things to the point where we are banging against each other's heads

616
01:02:17.20 --> 01:02:25.84
and we don't get along and we've got people that sit so far apart in their beliefs not only do they

617
01:02:25.84 --> 01:02:31.76
sit so far apart in their beliefs they can't find common ground on anything on anything

618
01:02:33.60 --> 01:02:44.56
and we've got known known actors in the world that make moves to increase the division

619
01:02:44.56 --> 01:02:51.12
between the sides of people that we have in America and the people in America don't even recognize

620
01:02:51.12 --> 01:03:02.16
that all of this fighting is making our platoon weak it's very interesting isn't it it's very

621
01:03:02.16 --> 01:03:09.44
interesting that we know that there are actors that are there are state actors that are

622
01:03:09.44 --> 01:03:15.36
creating divisiveness in our own country and yet instead of saying hey you know what actually

623
01:03:15.36 --> 01:03:19.12
we shouldn't argue about that stuff you know a day you got your opinion on that I got my opinion

624
01:03:19.12 --> 01:03:23.28
but you know there's a bunch of stuff we agree on let's focus on that okay you know what that

625
01:03:23.28 --> 01:03:28.16
makes sense we can go execute the mission now instead no you know what day if you don't agree with me on this

626
01:03:28.16 --> 01:03:33.68
we'll screw you I don't even want to work with you now we can't operate we can't get anything done

627
01:03:33.68 --> 01:03:41.92
so obvious yeah it's so obvious it's hard to look at too because not only you're going to disagree

628
01:03:41.92 --> 01:03:48.56
you think you're going to actively sabotage my effort hundred percent and and the hardest part

629
01:03:48.56 --> 01:03:55.12
about that is that the reality is we are on the same team those two those two platoons in your

630
01:03:55.12 --> 01:04:04.24
task unit they're on the same team they're very disturbing yeah I've been sure I've got to think

631
01:04:04.24 --> 01:04:11.20
of way to articulate that a little bit more clearly and in present it in a way that people can see it

632
01:04:11.20 --> 01:04:16.80
but it's very difficult because when you present it if I present it to vupiltoon and say hey guys

633
01:04:16.80 --> 01:04:23.52
I think it looks like we're we're actually we're actually not helping here we're not moving this thing

634
01:04:23.52 --> 01:04:28.24
forward you know what one size is oh so you're trying to take their side are you yeah that's exactly

635
01:04:28.24 --> 01:04:32.72
what happens that's and that's the point I was thinking when you said that when you you know you you

636
01:04:32.72 --> 01:04:38.40
were sort of overt like I showed a little bias towards this one team which is all the other side

637
01:04:38.40 --> 01:04:44.08
needs to go oh I see what's up you're on oh yeah I see what you're doing you want to them yeah

638
01:04:44.08 --> 01:04:48.64
I see what you're getting at so I've got to think of a way to articulate this properly in

639
01:04:48.64 --> 01:04:55.12
people because right now but we don't understand it as Americans we are in this sort of trap

640
01:04:55.12 --> 01:05:00.40
where there's a total lack of coordination between the different sides yeah our government can't even

641
01:05:00.40 --> 01:05:07.84
get anything done they're they're they're they're losers they're just not not making any progress

642
01:05:09.28 --> 01:05:13.60
and all the doing is fighting with each other and not realizing that while we're fighting each other

643
01:05:13.60 --> 01:05:21.84
number one there's other state actors that are that are feeding this fight and while they're

644
01:05:21.84 --> 01:05:26.08
while they're feeding our fighting we're having these invites guess what these other state actors are doing

645
01:05:26.88 --> 01:05:34.56
growing their economy unifying their people growing their military strength

646
01:05:34.56 --> 01:05:47.12
growing the will of their people and we are being divided I'll think of a way to try and

647
01:05:47.12 --> 01:05:53.20
communicate this so people will hopefully start to understand it I haven't done a good job thus far

648
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.64
meanwhile back on Singapore there's a total lack of coordination between the three services

649
01:06:00.64 --> 01:06:04.08
the the reason this is such a fitting thing is because you're going to see what happens in Singapore

650
01:06:04.08 --> 01:06:11.36
when you don't work together and when you're ego oh yeah by the way Dave I think I know everything

651
01:06:11.36 --> 01:06:16.48
and so therefore how can you possibly be right on anything at all yeah you certainly know you're right

652
01:06:16.48 --> 01:06:24.16
oh I definitely know I'm right the RAF began constructing airfield without consultation

653
01:06:24.16 --> 01:06:27.28
with the army who would have to defend them so there's a great move

654
01:06:27.28 --> 01:06:34.08
uh Japanese military machine was oh yeah this was the belief was look the Japanese they're

655
01:06:34.08 --> 01:06:37.52
primitive they're not going to be able to we shouldn't even take them seriously

656
01:06:39.76 --> 01:06:45.28
thus and now fast forward a little bit thus when the melee tribune published the news that

657
01:06:45.28 --> 01:06:50.48
Japanese transports had been cited off the southern tip of inno china the editor was immediately

658
01:06:50.48 --> 01:06:57.20
castigated by the commander and chief of the far east air chief marshal sir robber brook ponom

659
01:06:57.20 --> 01:07:03.84
popham who said I consider it most improper to print such a larmist views at a time like the

660
01:07:03.84 --> 01:07:11.68
present the position isn't half so serious as the tribune makes out this is such a great little section

661
01:07:11.68 --> 01:07:17.04
he says this form of complaint is not without interest firstly he did not deny the truth of the

662
01:07:17.04 --> 01:07:23.92
press release he hardly could since it originated in report by roiders which had been passed by

663
01:07:23.92 --> 01:07:31.60
the sensor and which undoubtedly was true secondly he managed to imply all in one breath that the

664
01:07:31.60 --> 01:07:37.20
situation was both not serious and yet likely to cause a alarm like why are you causing a alarm like

665
01:07:37.20 --> 01:07:39.68
this Dave and by the way there's nothing to be panicked about

666
01:07:39.68 --> 01:07:47.92
uh his words exemplified a tendency seen all too often to talk down to a civilian population as

667
01:07:47.92 --> 01:07:54.24
a group through some weakness of intellect or lack of moral fiber oh sorry who through some

668
01:07:54.24 --> 01:07:58.48
weakness of intellect or lack of moral fiber could not be trusted with information held by

669
01:07:58.48 --> 01:08:02.40
their elders and better's meaning the military's like you don't really know what's going on here

670
01:08:03.04 --> 01:08:08.16
you need to worry about that the guardians of Singapore were prime exemplars of this motivation

671
01:08:08.16 --> 01:08:13.12
after a long history of wrong thinking they could not afford to be found mistaken the more events

672
01:08:13.12 --> 01:08:18.000
prove them to be wrong the stronger their defenses became against admitting this to be the case

673
01:08:20.16 --> 01:08:25.36
and this is very important as Hitler's administration demonstrated in its darkest form

674
01:08:26.32 --> 01:08:32.64
man this is important suppression of the truth involves two procedures on the one hand

675
01:08:32.64 --> 01:08:40.40
censorship and on the other hand official communicates the high command and Singapore employed

676
01:08:40.40 --> 01:08:46.96
both measures take the order of the day released to the melee tribune a bear two months

677
01:08:46.96 --> 01:08:54.80
before Singapore capitulated it reads we are ready we have had plenty of warning and our

678
01:08:54.80 --> 01:08:59.92
preparations are made and tested we are confident our defenses are strong and our weapons efficient

679
01:08:59.92 --> 01:09:06.000
whatever our race we have one aim and one only it is to defend these shores to destroy such

680
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.88
of our enemies as may set foot on our soil what of our enemy we have seen before us Japan

681
01:09:12.88 --> 01:09:18.40
drained for years by exhausting claims of our want non-slot of China let us all remember that

682
01:09:18.40 --> 01:09:23.76
we here in the far-reast form part of the great campaign in the world of truth and justice and freedom

683
01:09:23.76 --> 01:09:30.56
as the editor of the tribune said it was hard to believe that anybody could deliberately tell

684
01:09:30.56 --> 01:09:38.96
some any lies on Monday the 18th 1941 general headquarters issued its first war

685
01:09:38.96 --> 01:09:44.08
communicate it stated that the Japanese had failed in their attempt to land at Kotabaru

686
01:09:44.08 --> 01:09:48.48
this was followed shortly after by a second communicator which stated all surface craft are

687
01:09:48.48 --> 01:09:53.36
retiring at high speed and the few troops left on the beach are being heavily machine gun.

688
01:09:54.96 --> 01:09:58.96
In fact the communicator was essentially untrue and deliberately misleading within a space of a few

689
01:09:58.96 --> 01:10:03.04
hours from the time of the Japanese landing Kotabaru's firmly in enemy hands.

690
01:10:05.68 --> 01:10:10.48
There's a couple battleships as a desperate metal measure two battleships the Prince of Wales

691
01:10:10.48 --> 01:10:15.52
and the repulse were sent to Singapore to create an 11th hour presence they were under the command

692
01:10:15.52 --> 01:10:22.16
of admiral Sir Tom Phillips in the words of one who met him quote a real old sea dog

693
01:10:22.16 --> 01:10:31.52
bluff and tough unfortunately he lacks a fishing vision despite strong warnings that he could not

694
01:10:31.52 --> 01:10:35.60
expect adequate air cover he was soon off with his two ships in search of trouble.

695
01:10:36.64 --> 01:10:40.56
At first all went well as the ship steamed reassuringly up the east coast

696
01:10:40.56 --> 01:10:46.40
I'm here that there was weather so he thought he'd be okay his ships both the weather lifted

697
01:10:47.04 --> 01:10:51.84
his ships were spotted by Japanese air force torpedoed in sunk with a total loss of 8040 officers

698
01:10:51.84 --> 01:10:55.76
in men by all accounts filled so the boys of brave and conscientious officer but his

699
01:10:55.76 --> 01:11:00.72
braveness bordered on full-heartedness and his errors of judgment not only had a devastating effect

700
01:11:00.72 --> 01:11:06.08
on that much cherished commodity but the morale of the Singapore civilians also sealed the fate of

701
01:11:06.08 --> 01:11:12.64
their city so much for the navy and their chosen field the senior command of the RAF acquitted

702
01:11:12.64 --> 01:11:18.16
themselves the little better better. It has already been seen how air chief marshal broke

703
01:11:18.16 --> 01:11:24.24
pompom underestimated jab japan's air strength in comparison with his own ills assorted

704
01:11:24.24 --> 01:11:30.88
group of obsolete aircraft the same 63-year-old officer whose most notable characteristic was a

705
01:11:30.88 --> 01:11:38.24
tendency to fall asleep on the slightest pretext showed such disastrous hesitancy and indecision

706
01:11:38.24 --> 01:11:43.20
in his capacity is commander chief that as the official history was moved to state quote

707
01:11:43.20 --> 01:11:48.56
it is possible that he did not fully realize the importance of speed the need for quick decision

708
01:11:48.56 --> 01:11:54.96
was not apparently realized at headquarters malaya command and this is something I talked about earlier

709
01:11:54.96 --> 01:12:01.28
the first night raid they get a warning 30 minutes early that there's japanese inbound

710
01:12:03.28 --> 01:12:08.16
and they didn't do anything it seems the japanese had committed the unforgivable foe

711
01:12:08.16 --> 01:12:12.48
pava tacking at night unforgivable because it conflicted with the official dogma that the

712
01:12:12.48 --> 01:12:20.000
japanese were unable to fly their planes during the hours of darkness this idea cost Singapore 61 dead

713
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.52
and 133 injured but the recklessness of the addonals and the did the ring of the air marshals would nothing

714
01:12:27.12 --> 01:12:34.56
as to the uncompromising of the generals it seemed that nothing could move them not even

715
01:12:34.56 --> 01:12:41.44
pleading of their fellow officers as noo barber says in his book sinister twilight quote

716
01:12:41.44 --> 01:12:46.24
when big brigadier general simpson and you remember this is like the good guy when brigadier general

717
01:12:46.24 --> 01:12:50.80
simpson the chief engineer went to see major general gordon Bennett commanding the eight

718
01:12:50.80 --> 01:12:55.12
australian division he founded impossible to make him realize that there was an urgent need for

719
01:12:55.12 --> 01:12:59.76
anti take defenses at first he did not want to discuss the matter at all since he noted after

720
01:12:59.76 --> 01:13:05.68
the meeting since it was horrified could not the australian general understand that there was nothing

721
01:13:05.68 --> 01:13:11.52
on the long road to prevent the enemy from reaching them apparently gordon Bennett could not

722
01:13:11.52 --> 01:13:17.28
for in his diary that night he wrote malay command sent brigadier simpson to discuss with me the

723
01:13:17.28 --> 01:13:21.36
creation of anti-tank obstacles for you saw the road personally have little time for these

724
01:13:21.36 --> 01:13:26.96
obstacles preferring to stop and destroy tanks with anti-tank weapons no wonder that the

725
01:13:26.96 --> 01:13:31.52
japanese never slowed down no wonder that time after time troops were annihilated by skillful

726
01:13:31.52 --> 01:13:36.56
japanese enveloping tactics on the british side wrong decisions were made communications

727
01:13:36.56 --> 01:13:42.08
broke down whole pockets of troops were caught off first japanese tanks appeared and came as a great

728
01:13:42.08 --> 01:13:48.80
surprise to the british who had not won single tank in malaya in a jungle country where the

729
01:13:48.80 --> 01:13:53.28
british had insisted that tanks could never operate the japanese tanks moved easily between

730
01:13:53.28 --> 01:13:59.12
spacious rows of rubber tree and quote major general gordon Bennett was not to use the appropriate

731
01:13:59.12 --> 01:14:04.40
vernacular and isolated pocket of resistance nor did he hold the record of obscenancy in

732
01:14:04.40 --> 01:14:09.60
barber's words a tamps by brigadier simpson to move and add to the defenses had been

733
01:14:09.60 --> 01:14:17.36
blocked at every turn largely by general person who seemed to have had a fixation against such

734
01:14:17.36 --> 01:14:23.52
measures nothing had been done nothing was being done despite previous please a hazard of belonging

735
01:14:23.52 --> 01:14:31.04
to any rigidity any rigidly authoritarian hierarchical organization is that from time to time the individual

736
01:14:31.04 --> 01:14:36.48
out of dire necessity or from strong personal conviction feels compelled to apply pressures to those

737
01:14:36.48 --> 01:14:43.04
above him it is a hazard because the ethos of the organization whether it be a Victorian

738
01:14:43.04 --> 01:14:48.000
family and english boarding school or the british army demands that pressure always moves only

739
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.88
in one way downwards rather than upwards to buck the system by prodding those above can have

740
01:14:54.88 --> 01:15:02.72
unpleasant consequences you're totally freaking rigid situation and simpson is trying

741
01:15:04.16 --> 01:15:07.84
simpson is trying i'm a fast for a little bit it seems that simpson was past taking no

742
01:15:07.84 --> 01:15:12.24
for an answer for he said to the general sir i must emphasize the urgency of doing everything to help

743
01:15:12.24 --> 01:15:16.88
our troops they're often only partially trained they're tired and disperse it they've been

744
01:15:16.88 --> 01:15:21.68
retreating for hundreds of miles and please remember sir the japanese are better trained better equipped

745
01:15:21.68 --> 01:15:27.84
and they're inspired by an unbroken run of victories and it has to be done now sir once the

746
01:15:27.84 --> 01:15:34.24
area comes under fire civilian labor will vanish he's wanting to get these just just get freaking

747
01:15:34.24 --> 01:15:41.12
obstacles set up the plea was forceful respectful and logical but amazingly the general remained

748
01:15:41.12 --> 01:15:46.56
unmoved simpson in his rising anger said look here general i've raised this question time after

749
01:15:46.56 --> 01:15:52.24
time you've always refused what more you've always refused to give me any reasons at least tell me one

750
01:15:52.24 --> 01:15:57.44
thing why on earth are you taking this stand who's like what what the hell aren't you want me

751
01:15:57.44 --> 01:16:03.52
build obstacles wrong with you why not at long last the general officer commanding muleia gave

752
01:16:03.52 --> 01:16:08.72
his answer quote i believe the defenses of the sword you want to throw up are bad for the morale

753
01:16:08.72 --> 01:16:16.32
of the troops and civilians and quote since it was quote frankly horrified and remember standing

754
01:16:16.32 --> 01:16:20.64
there in the room suddenly feeling quite cold and realizing that except for a miracle

755
01:16:20.64 --> 01:16:27.04
Singapore was as good as lost as you put on his sam brown since could not for beer to make one last

756
01:16:27.04 --> 01:16:32.40
remark quote sir it is going to be much worse from a while if the japanese start running all over

757
01:16:32.40 --> 01:16:43.28
the island you can't make it that is so hard to listen to and for whatever sense of

758
01:16:43.28 --> 01:16:47.28
validation in my head of as soon as he said it's bad from rallin for stallus you know what's

759
01:16:47.28 --> 01:16:52.08
worse from rall and of course you know i don't know he's gonna say but i understand that that's

760
01:16:52.08 --> 01:16:56.24
what this guy is seeing or thinking and you saying that doesn't make me feel any better because

761
01:16:57.44 --> 01:17:04.24
it's just i'm not just getting repetitive at this point it's just a you have to be crazy to not except

762
01:17:06.40 --> 01:17:11.76
to not accept the facts that don't align with the world v the created in your head yeah

763
01:17:11.76 --> 01:17:16.48
and i'm only reading chunks of the book it's even worse than it's worse than i'm making it sound

764
01:17:17.36 --> 01:17:22.56
and i have the distinct disadvantage of seeing how much of this how much of this is going to be

765
01:17:22.56 --> 01:17:27.76
a gone through and go wow there's chunk i mean big big chunks which i can only assume

766
01:17:28.32 --> 01:17:33.12
just as we enforce over and over again another example another example another example another

767
01:17:33.12 --> 01:17:38.72
example and this dude is a good writer and he's a good writer and you and i'm glad that in the

768
01:17:38.72 --> 01:17:46.72
very beginning you set this up this this isn't a researcher this isn't like a theorist or or a

769
01:17:47.44 --> 01:17:52.72
you know an academic he has all those categories this guy fought this guy fought in this

770
01:17:52.72 --> 01:17:57.84
board so he was a warrior he ever assumed it yes yes by his own incompetent but

771
01:17:57.84 --> 01:18:02.16
he was on admission by the time he was like he's humble yeah which is awesome so

772
01:18:02.16 --> 01:18:07.60
yeah this is this is rough and and i think what i'm still adding to this is just i think it's

773
01:18:07.60 --> 01:18:15.36
at a point of repetition of just it's really hard to accept that these are real stories from

774
01:18:15.36 --> 01:18:22.32
real people in real leadership positions leading up to what was just people getting slaughtered

775
01:18:26.64 --> 01:18:31.20
you know like you said he was a soldier but he's also a psychologist and so he gives the

776
01:18:31.20 --> 01:18:36.32
psychological assessments to so here's here's one of them in the case of personal and Gordon

777
01:18:36.32 --> 01:18:42.000
Bennett to erect defenses would have been to admit to themselves the danger in which they stood

778
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.56
in other words their professional anxiety about civilian morale was really displaced anxiety

779
01:18:48.56 --> 01:18:54.48
about their own morale looking further into the story of Singapore want to struck by the

780
01:18:54.48 --> 01:19:01.20
compulsive element in this refusal of the military to defend itself such compulsive behavior is typical

781
01:19:01.20 --> 01:19:08.32
of many who present an authoritarian personality and are reared in an organization which traditionally

782
01:19:08.32 --> 01:19:18.56
deals with fear and danger by ritualistic means i.e. bullshit, chicken shit, drill and parades etc.

783
01:19:18.56 --> 01:19:24.000
or is what i think he referred to earlier is like the real business of soldier and we're going to

784
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.64
get back to you know drill and ceremonies so there's there's a there's an admiral that comes along

785
01:19:30.64 --> 01:19:38.96
or so yeah who was it supreme commander of allied forces in the far east this guy archbilled

786
01:19:38.96 --> 01:19:46.56
wavel and he he shows up and it's kind of like what the hell's going on bro so then next thing

787
01:19:46.56 --> 01:19:51.28
it happens is a direct from Churchill giving detailed instructions on how to defend the north shore

788
01:19:51.28 --> 01:19:57.28
the measures listed were precisely those which had been advocated by Simpson but despite these pressures

789
01:19:58.08 --> 01:20:03.20
persevolts still did nothing when he eventually issued a plan it was already too late for the

790
01:20:03.20 --> 01:20:07.84
necessary civilian labor was no longer available just as Simpson is at it was going to be on the

791
01:20:07.84 --> 01:20:13.84
disposition of his forces' personal thinking seemed no less deranged rather than hold a force in

792
01:20:13.84 --> 01:20:19.36
reserve that could could be rushed quickly to wherever the Japanese eventually chose to land he

793
01:20:19.36 --> 01:20:26.48
decided to spread his troops thinly over a long front in other words he decided now because it

794
01:20:26.48 --> 01:20:32.000
would be good for morale just exactly what he had refused to do early because it would be bad from

795
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.72
morale in this battle of Singapore and they put that in quotes order of the day,

796
01:20:36.72 --> 01:20:43.36
first of all made it made great play of phrases like the enemy within our gates loose talk and

797
01:20:43.36 --> 01:20:50.40
rumor mongering all calculated to alarm civilians and this from the man who had laid such stress

798
01:20:50.40 --> 01:20:57.92
on the importance of civilian morale of this period barbarites in all the catalog of ineffectual

799
01:20:57.92 --> 01:21:05.12
leadership nothing is quite so public puzzling as the virtual absence of any deterrent action

800
01:21:05.12 --> 01:21:10.40
during the last precious hours of daylight before the Japanese attacked it is hard to believe that a

801
01:21:10.40 --> 01:21:19.76
modern general could so easily ignore what was happening around him that's I've never heard quite

802
01:21:19.76 --> 01:21:26.08
as bold of the statement as in all the catalog of ineffectual leadership that's a bold one yeah that's

803
01:21:26.08 --> 01:21:37.52
a big catalog says for the allies it was a week of chaos and confusion unreleave by any

804
01:21:37.52 --> 01:21:44.000
vestiges of competent leadership or general ship thanks to the absence of defenses including a

805
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.20
failure to use search lights which had been assembled to blind and make targets of the attackers

806
01:21:49.20 --> 01:21:56.24
as they paddled in a way across the johor straits the Japanese landed almost unmolested

807
01:21:57.84 --> 01:22:03.36
despite a devastating barrage from Japanese artillery British guns instead of pounding the

808
01:22:03.36 --> 01:22:11.68
enemy's point of embarkation remained mute awaiting orders that never came despite weeks of warning

809
01:22:11.68 --> 01:22:20.40
allied ground forces were speedily outflanked and circled caught off or routed in the event

810
01:22:22.08 --> 01:22:31.52
138,78 British Indian and Australian soldiers either died or went into captivity

811
01:22:31.52 --> 01:22:41.76
this is the beginning of few fliss and applaud cast number 12, Alistair O'erhart the forgotten

812
01:22:41.76 --> 01:22:48.32
highlander this is this is where he starts his captivity I think he'd been in the army for like

813
01:22:48.32 --> 01:22:51.36
two or three months at this point 19 years old

814
01:22:51.36 --> 01:23:01.76
138,01 event

815
01:23:05.04 --> 01:23:10.24
of all the instances of military incompetence considered in this book is the fall of Singapore which

816
01:23:10.24 --> 01:23:15.92
most clearly gives the lie to the so-called bloody full theory of military and aptitude

817
01:23:15.92 --> 01:23:21.60
personal was in fact highly intelligent and had shown himself in previous years to be a brilliant

818
01:23:21.60 --> 01:23:28.16
staff officer what he shared with other earlier military incompetence were pacivity

819
01:23:29.60 --> 01:23:35.92
the opposite of default aggressive by the way and courtesy rigidity and

820
01:23:35.92 --> 01:23:50.24
obsidency procrastination gentleness and dogmatism 138,2 battleships by the way

821
01:23:52.88 --> 01:23:57.04
insane

822
01:23:57.04 --> 01:24:09.44
the next chapter is about our name this is when we covered we covered say we covered

823
01:24:09.44 --> 01:24:13.04
part of Singapore obviously when we covered Alexander Erhart

824
01:24:13.04 --> 01:24:15.04
our then we covered podcast 94

825
01:24:16.88 --> 01:24:22.08
the book was called man at arm and rid my Jeffrey Powell who was there who fought there

826
01:24:22.08 --> 01:24:29.44
and I think you know when you read the reading this assessment

827
01:24:31.76 --> 01:24:36.80
really puts it really puts that book in the perspective it starts off with this

828
01:24:36.80 --> 01:24:42.48
couple quotes all the accumulated evidence confirms that like gallipoli this was a British

829
01:24:42.48 --> 01:24:47.76
disaster where naked courage lacked the bodyguard of competent planning competent intelligence

830
01:24:47.76 --> 01:24:54.48
competent technology yet wars object is victory not the Victoria Cross

831
01:24:55.52 --> 01:25:01.60
and it was shameful that by autumn of 1944 we could still be so amateur

832
01:25:04.56 --> 01:25:09.20
the object is victory not the Victoria Cross we don't that's the equivalent of the metal of

833
01:25:09.20 --> 01:25:17.52
honor in England here's a private soldiers comments it began to seem to me that the generals had

834
01:25:17.52 --> 01:25:19.84
got us into something they had no business doing

835
01:25:23.60 --> 01:25:29.12
if it achieved nothing else operation market garden Montgomery's plan to capture and hold

836
01:25:29.12 --> 01:25:34.40
the bridge head across the Rhine in northern Holland at least demolishes the myth that military

837
01:25:34.40 --> 01:25:41.28
incompetence stems from stupidity for sheer initiative quickness of mind fortitude and

838
01:25:41.28 --> 01:25:46.72
selfless heroism the conduct of those who actually fought the battle has never been surpassed

839
01:25:48.80 --> 01:25:55.28
by the same token the men who planned and administered the operation were probably as intellectually

840
01:25:55.28 --> 01:26:01.84
gifted well trained professionally competent dedicated and conscientious as any military planners

841
01:26:01.84 --> 01:26:09.84
have ever been and yet the unfolding of market garden revealed all the symptoms of high-level

842
01:26:09.84 --> 01:26:17.92
military incompetence that's like in how would you feel if someone said you know what Dave

843
01:26:17.92 --> 01:26:22.88
your intellectually gifted well trained professionally competent dedicated and conscientious

844
01:26:22.88 --> 01:26:33.76
but that's what we're looking for in our leaders and yet this thing is a disaster the failure of the

845
01:26:33.76 --> 01:26:43.20
operation resulted from a a linked together of the following factors

846
01:26:45.84 --> 01:26:50.48
one as a result of his neglect to open up the port of Antwerp by clearing the

847
01:26:50.48 --> 01:26:56.48
shell the shell the estuary Montgomery allowed the German 15th Army to escape north into Holland

848
01:26:56.48 --> 01:27:05.60
where it was available to defend the approaches to Archnum two the arrival at Arnhem of

849
01:27:05.60 --> 01:27:13.76
30 chord depended upon the advancing across 64 miles of enemy health territory on a one tank front

850
01:27:13.76 --> 01:27:21.28
along elevated unprotected highways flanked by a soft and tank and sawed and tank proof landscape

851
01:27:21.28 --> 01:27:29.20
interspersed with waterways any delay a blown bridge an enemy ambush a block road and the

852
01:27:29.20 --> 01:27:35.44
entire column would be stopped any delay and the Germans would have more time to bring up reinforcements

853
01:27:35.44 --> 01:27:43.04
in the event it is hardly surprising that 30 chord never did reach Arnhem that they could not achieve

854
01:27:43.04 --> 01:27:49.44
it even in nine days what it had been scheduled to take 48 hours now i'm going to say i know i gave

855
01:27:49.44 --> 01:27:55.44
credit to your 12 year old daughter and i'm going to say 12 year old daughter might not be able to

856
01:27:55.44 --> 01:28:02.56
figure this one out look you look and you got to go 60 what is it 60 4 miles 67 miles 64 miles

857
01:28:02.56 --> 01:28:16.48
but pretty much any land corporal mhm ring court sees a channelized 64 mile road that's completely

858
01:28:16.48 --> 01:28:23.68
exposed to the enemy and doesn't like this plan yeah if i'm hearing it correctly what you're

859
01:28:23.68 --> 01:28:28.000
describing is a one essentially a one it's it you called it a single tank approach so one lane

860
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.32
highway which on either side is impossible yeah due to you know canals and and and deterring whatever it is

861
01:28:34.32 --> 01:28:38.96
it's impossible you have a one lane highway and your entire formation is going to be single file

862
01:28:38.96 --> 01:28:45.76
this is going to work and he mentions we might get ambushed right or or we might get a blown bridge

863
01:28:45.76 --> 01:28:51.44
how about this a broken down tank how about how about we have a freaking crash

864
01:28:51.44 --> 01:28:59.04
oh yeah number three as might have been expected from what is known of English

865
01:28:59.04 --> 01:29:03.76
autumn's the mist if not the mellow fruitfulness of the of an English slate September

866
01:29:03.76 --> 01:29:07.12
delayed the departure of subsequent gliders and pair troopers for the reinforcement of the first

867
01:29:07.12 --> 01:29:14.56
armor division like we didn't think there might be fog in the morning wearing England market garden

868
01:29:14.56 --> 01:29:19.68
perhaps more than most military operations in the cessated good communication between the various

869
01:29:19.68 --> 01:29:23.44
units and commanders of the attacking force but here technology failed them

870
01:29:25.04 --> 01:29:30.56
though it was now 50 years since marconi its exceeding sending messages by wireless the radio sets

871
01:29:30.56 --> 01:29:36.56
carried by the invasion force proved useless unless within air shot of each other no one knew

872
01:29:36.56 --> 01:29:42.96
what anyone else was doing and look you can say technology failed them if i'm a freaking military

873
01:29:42.96 --> 01:29:53.12
planner and i'm's relying on the communications in 1944 that's what's going to make us successful

874
01:29:53.12 --> 01:30:00.64
you're an idiot we can barely rely on communications 10 years ago we can rely on them up a lot more now

875
01:30:01.76 --> 01:30:05.52
maybe okay not 10 years ago sorry uh 20 years ago 20 years ago

876
01:30:05.52 --> 01:30:13.28
your barely your barely like to the year 2000 your barely thing oh yeah we don't we will get

877
01:30:13.28 --> 01:30:19.20
comms we had backup comms all the time backup communication plans we had all the time

878
01:30:19.20 --> 01:30:23.76
and you know what we had them in romatti as well of course yeah so to think that your comms are

879
01:30:23.76 --> 01:30:30.08
going to be good to go in 1944 that's not technology fail that's a freaking lack of planning yeah

880
01:30:30.08 --> 01:30:37.04
a single point of failure probably the most critical thing you're able to do is talk yeah more

881
01:30:37.04 --> 01:30:42.40
than employ your weapons even more than moving your ability to talk is probably the most critical

882
01:30:42.40 --> 01:30:46.40
thing that you have to coordinate all these different assets all these different things going on

883
01:30:48.40 --> 01:30:53.36
i can't say can't bury and we had i remember when i was in romatti because as an angle go marine

884
01:30:54.40 --> 01:30:59.76
comms was my was really the number one thing you was secondary to the utilization of the aircraft

885
01:30:59.76 --> 01:31:03.44
number one was comms we had this incredible comms we didn't every brief was hey let's

886
01:31:03.44 --> 01:31:07.28
hire let's create the prioritization of how we're going to communicate and it was based on where

887
01:31:07.28 --> 01:31:11.60
we were how far away we're going to be what assets were available if i have a home be cool i got

888
01:31:11.60 --> 01:31:15.60
a vehicle it's powered i got this high powered antenna i've got these cool powered radios

889
01:31:15.60 --> 01:31:18.72
and if i got to get out of that home be in start walking i don't have that thing and no i can't

890
01:31:18.72 --> 01:31:22.72
have a backup plan no and every single mission i went on me and my radio operator talked about

891
01:31:23.44 --> 01:31:29.36
if this doesn't work what are we going to do and guess what stuff eat the nicest best

892
01:31:29.36 --> 01:31:34.08
high step tech's it didn't work routinely yep and by the way what are you doing then you're getting

893
01:31:34.08 --> 01:31:39.92
out your signal panel right we're marking our position to put a big orange panel

894
01:31:44.64 --> 01:31:49.92
number five since the airborne assault was to take place in daylight and because it was vital

895
01:31:49.92 --> 01:31:55.92
that thirty core should complete their journey within 48 hours 64 miles and 48 hours on the

896
01:31:55.92 --> 01:32:01.76
single track the whole enterprise depended upon the absence of strong German forces both in rnm

897
01:32:03.28 --> 01:32:07.76
area and on the approach route from the south hence it came with something as a jolt

898
01:32:08.40 --> 01:32:13.76
when they received reports from the Dutch underground that two SS Panzer divisions which had

899
01:32:13.76 --> 01:32:19.60
mysteriously disappeared sometime previously had now reappeared along sa almost alongside the

900
01:32:19.60 --> 01:32:24.88
dropping zone this information passed on among gummery received support from the British

901
01:32:24.88 --> 01:32:30.88
aerial photography of German tanks in the arnm area meanwhile forward troops in the British

902
01:32:30.88 --> 01:32:35.92
second army reported a buildup of German forces along their intended line of advance

903
01:32:38.16 --> 01:32:44.000
hmm might want to reconsider this is the moment to reassess the risks involved but since these

904
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:51.20
ugly facts did not accord with what they had planned they fell upon a succession of deaf airs

905
01:32:51.20 --> 01:33:00.000
taking the lead from Montgomery who described the report as ridiculous British second army headquarters

906
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:05.92
were quick to discount it also when one of his intelligence officers showed him the aerial photographs

907
01:33:05.92 --> 01:33:11.20
of a German armor general browning at first British airborne headquarters reported I wouldn't

908
01:33:11.20 --> 01:33:15.52
trouble myself about the use of fire were you they are probably not serviceable at any rate

909
01:33:15.52 --> 01:33:25.04
if there is any stronger form of just straight like denial and idiocy than that right there

910
01:33:25.04 --> 01:33:31.44
you get shown the first you get intel reports and then you get shown photographs of the armor

911
01:33:31.44 --> 01:33:37.28
tanks the German tanks on the ground and you're like they're probably not serviceable you can't

912
01:33:37.28 --> 01:33:44.24
make this shit up you also know that there are two divisions there that are gone it's it's they didn't

913
01:33:44.24 --> 01:33:54.56
appear out of nowhere you know these divisions existed yeah that's the intelligence officer was

914
01:33:54.56 --> 01:33:59.20
then visited by the core medical officer who suggested he should take some leave because he was so

915
01:33:59.20 --> 01:34:07.12
obviously exhausted and at first allied army headquarters the chief intelligence officer

916
01:34:07.12 --> 01:34:10.64
British British Lieutenant Colonel decided there was no direct evidence that the

917
01:34:10.64 --> 01:34:15.68
Arnum area contained quote much more than the considerable flag defenses already known to exist

918
01:34:16.32 --> 01:34:22.48
as Ryan puts it quote all down the allied line of command the evaluation of intelligence on the

919
01:34:22.48 --> 01:34:31.20
panzers in Arnum area was magnificently bungled finally just in case there were any residual doubts

920
01:34:31.20 --> 01:34:35.92
the intelligence staff for the second army came up with the reassuring opinion that any German

921
01:34:35.92 --> 01:34:43.76
forces in the Arnum area were quote weak demoralized and likely to collapse if confronted with a

922
01:34:43.76 --> 01:34:56.72
large airborne attack that geek that's insane the freaking Nazis the Nazis are trying to defend

923
01:34:56.72 --> 01:35:07.52
their like they're fighting for their lives they're fighting for their country they know what happens

924
01:35:07.52 --> 01:35:13.36
if they lose they're some of the finest fighting forces in the world and yet we're just going

925
01:35:13.36 --> 01:35:18.40
to go ahead and catalog them as weak demoralized it likely to collapse and by the way randomly

926
01:35:18.40 --> 01:35:22.000
it just if they're confronted with a large airborne attack like that's the thing

927
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.76
because hey when you're an airborne attack because that means you you you even have anti-tank weapons

928
01:35:27.76 --> 01:35:31.44
barely you've got no armor this is ridiculous

929
01:35:35.20 --> 01:35:41.44
market garden went ahead but not so quite as planned instead of encountering a few old men

930
01:35:41.44 --> 01:35:46.000
who collapsed a ran away first airborne division fell upon a horn it's nest of German armor

931
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.48
far from being demoralized the enemy fought like tigers to defend the gateway of their homeland

932
01:35:53.84 --> 01:35:58.32
and far from sweeping across Holland to aid the hard pressed pair troops the tanks of the

933
01:35:58.32 --> 01:36:05.28
second armies 30 court were reduced to a crawl by the combination of unsuitable terrain and determined

934
01:36:05.28 --> 01:36:07.28
opposition

935
01:36:07.28 --> 01:36:15.92
and this is going to finish out the section the book defeat was absolute and terrible

936
01:36:18.24 --> 01:36:23.68
short on everything but courage the men of first airborne division held on

937
01:36:24.40 --> 01:36:29.68
until their numbers had been reduced from 10,000 and five to less than a quarter of that figure

938
01:36:29.68 --> 01:36:38.16
total allied losses and killed wounded and missing exceeded 17,000

939
01:36:39.28 --> 01:36:43.76
some 5,000 more than those who became casualties on day

940
01:36:43.76 --> 01:37:03.12
so there you have it defeat was absolute and terrible and that despite the fact that for the

941
01:37:03.12 --> 01:37:08.000
beginning of this section sheer a niffed initiative quickness of mine fortitude and self

942
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.04
selfless heroism the conduct of those who actually fought the battle has never been surpassed

943
01:37:13.04 --> 01:37:15.84
and and this we want to talk about disturbing

944
01:37:19.68 --> 01:37:23.92
field marshal Montgomery described the mission as a 90% success

945
01:37:25.44 --> 01:37:29.68
that's that's how he presented it 90% success

946
01:37:31.12 --> 01:37:36.88
I think to be clear of anything in the aftermath of everything that has he considered it yeah

947
01:37:36.88 --> 01:37:45.44
he reported considered told people that this was a 90% success

948
01:37:48.24 --> 01:37:52.000
actually there's a little quote and there I got to read based on that

949
01:37:54.56 --> 01:38:05.36
there's this he so he says this is a 90% success and there's a Prince Bernard of the Netherlands

950
01:38:05.36 --> 01:38:11.44
said my country can never again afford the luxury of a Montgomery success yeah

951
01:38:14.16 --> 01:38:21.76
so that's what we've got it's insane it's weird how you and I are to loss for words over and over

952
01:38:21.76 --> 01:38:30.64
over again if you're listening to this and you've got some free time I think I mentioned it last

953
01:38:30.64 --> 01:38:35.68
time we're talking about some of the characters but band of brothers covers this and market garden from the

954
01:38:35.68 --> 01:38:42.000
American you know airborne troopers and and our now there's a cool

955
01:38:42.96 --> 01:38:46.96
replaying and retelling of this and what we saw in the combination of that but this is revealed there

956
01:38:46.96 --> 01:38:52.000
it's it's very well done but it does not it does not

957
01:38:53.68 --> 01:38:59.36
expose the depths of the why behind it it looks at it looks like it looks at it from a tactical point of

958
01:38:59.36 --> 01:39:04.56
view and it's it's very good to see it's really you should watch it it's not the band of brothers is awesome

959
01:39:04.56 --> 01:39:10.16
but this takes it and reveals it on a level that that for me the reason I can't I don't know what

960
01:39:10.16 --> 01:39:18.88
to say it's really hard to just it's this is this is 1944 yeah we aren't new we we we are not

961
01:39:18.88 --> 01:39:26.56
experienced yes indeed is behind us like this isn't figuring out how do we get our footing here

962
01:39:26.56 --> 01:39:31.12
things are not going though this isn't Singapore this isn't Pearl Harbor this isn't the invasion

963
01:39:31.12 --> 01:39:39.76
of Poland it isn't even the battle of Britain this is 1944 it's it's it's it's crazy you know that

964
01:39:39.76 --> 01:39:45.44
you can see I guess the British the British generals but they they have a different little character

965
01:39:45.44 --> 01:39:49.28
that they play you know when they get up and they need to convince people you can see like Monty right

966
01:39:49.28 --> 01:39:56.24
you know getting up but Jens is a rough fight but we've got 90% success right you know you can like

967
01:39:56.24 --> 01:40:03.76
that they're doing a different thing but it's the same it's a different accent but it's the same bullshit

968
01:40:05.44 --> 01:40:14.08
chest out for old eyebrows a little bit more a little bit more hotty from the brits from Montgummery

969
01:40:14.80 --> 01:40:22.000
but he's playing that same role and you gotta ask yourself why does this happen why why is this

970
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:29.28
happening why are we going through these historical examples it's not from technology it's not

971
01:40:29.28 --> 01:40:38.80
from lack of fighting spirit it's not the terrain that's bad leadership and where does this bad

972
01:40:38.80 --> 01:40:46.88
leadership come from where is it rooted well it is rooted in the psychological the psychological

973
01:40:46.88 --> 01:40:53.36
minds of these leaders and there's plenty of great ones and we're not talking about them on this

974
01:40:53.36 --> 01:41:02.24
podcast we're talking about the psychopaths and we will dive into that on the next podcast

975
01:41:03.28 --> 01:41:10.24
until then echo Charles yes you know we're we're trying to not be psychopathic types of leaders

976
01:41:10.24 --> 01:41:15.60
we're trying to be better not we're trying to be better in all ways you know

977
01:41:16.64 --> 01:41:21.92
yeah gonna be recommendations for us how does your better we're trying not to have monumental

978
01:41:21.92 --> 01:41:26.80
complacency that's definitely we're trying not to do that I think those is the thing yeah

979
01:41:28.16 --> 01:41:33.36
so yeah let's not do that come about that okay well let's start with ourselves right you start

980
01:41:33.36 --> 01:41:39.92
with yourself I'm not gonna put your oxygen mask on before my own okay yeah otherwise I cannot

981
01:41:39.92 --> 01:41:47.36
breathe the point you know well I guess technically speaking if I was in charge of a group of

982
01:41:47.36 --> 01:41:57.76
soldiers and I was I had gout I was overweight I was unhealthy I was mentally unstable

983
01:41:58.48 --> 01:42:01.92
I don't think I'm gonna do a good job leading my soldiers it's gonna be very hard yeah

984
01:42:01.92 --> 01:42:08.16
gonna be difficult yeah so let's to your point let's make sure we got our shit together

985
01:42:08.16 --> 01:42:13.36
yes sir I agree and yeah here's some ways to do it look we're working out we're reading

986
01:42:13.36 --> 01:42:18.16
we're reading we're definitely reading we're listening oh yeah that's what I do

987
01:42:19.20 --> 01:42:25.52
I listen work out yeah I work out and I listen you know and I'm reading here in there either way

988
01:42:27.12 --> 01:42:31.44
when we work out we do things we got to put our bodies through little something

989
01:42:32.24 --> 01:42:36.80
so they can adapt to be ready for a big something hopefully hopefully hopefully

990
01:42:36.80 --> 01:42:41.60
okay on this path we're gonna take some beatings it's okay we got some supplementation okay

991
01:42:41.60 --> 01:42:48.24
let's talk about energy drinks first energy drinks the good energy drinks actually now I think

992
01:42:48.24 --> 01:42:51.52
nowadays when we talk about energy drinks where I haven't talked about the matter when's anymore

993
01:42:51.52 --> 01:42:57.04
well unless we indicate so we need to make sure that we tell people that when we talk about energy drinks

994
01:42:57.04 --> 01:43:02.08
we're talking about a certain type of energy drink that's good for you in all aspects that's what I'm saying

995
01:43:02.08 --> 01:43:07.36
exactly okay there are energy instead of all of them for you yes sir but now for now from now on

996
01:43:07.36 --> 01:43:13.20
we're gonna indicate that we're talking about that kind either way I got you okay jocco displing go

997
01:43:14.40 --> 01:43:18.88
energy drinks if you don't know that's that's a healthy energy drink got a little bit of caffeine in

998
01:43:18.88 --> 01:43:24.08
now 95 milligrams like a cup of coffee yes sir um a bunch of other healthy stuff

999
01:43:24.88 --> 01:43:29.44
it's an energy drink that is literally healthy for you's new tropics vitamins boom there you go

1000
01:43:29.44 --> 01:43:34.48
yeah it's basically everything that you've come that you come to energy drinks for without the

1001
01:43:34.48 --> 01:43:39.20
the backside what it called tab you got to pay with your health have you ever do you like the taste of

1002
01:43:39.20 --> 01:43:45.44
any fast food well you know depends on like and yeah let me clear the path for you let me

1003
01:43:45.44 --> 01:43:52.24
you know you bring me to a Wendy's which I used to work at I'm going ham in Wendy's right

1004
01:43:52.24 --> 01:43:57.36
I just love like I would I really enjoy the taste of Wendy's probably two years ago

1005
01:43:57.36 --> 01:44:02.40
let's think one of my kids went and got McDonald's you familiar with this place I

1006
01:44:02.40 --> 01:44:10.16
I hear things yeah I had a couple fries and let's face it dude I mean these things are

1007
01:44:10.16 --> 01:44:21.76
engineered by doctors and physicists and chemists to satisfy your taste buds and your dopamine's

1008
01:44:21.76 --> 01:44:27.84
fire and right all the stuff is going on so now imagine this all that goodness imagine if you had

1009
01:44:27.84 --> 01:44:33.76
all that goodness and there was zero downside right you know it's funny I had this mental

1010
01:44:33.76 --> 01:44:39.04
excess because that's what you get with with with the go you get all that you get all that goodness

1011
01:44:39.04 --> 01:44:43.76
you get all that goodness everything and now that for yeah exactly no now that you just go

1012
01:44:43.76 --> 01:44:51.68
at just go ham you literally you're horrible you're not gonna see that I know I actually

1013
01:44:51.68 --> 01:44:58.56
probably am well maybe I don't know either way I signed up for all that seems to be yeah the McDonald's

1014
01:44:58.56 --> 01:45:04.16
thing I talked to my kids before they go on the Wendy's Burger King what you're go to well

1015
01:45:04.16 --> 01:45:12.32
I don't have a go I haven't legitimately had fast food in years like I haven't okay like I had a few

1016
01:45:12.32 --> 01:45:18.40
fries wait a second checkfully well during last things he's doing rest in season it's not

1017
01:45:18.40 --> 01:45:23.60
like as greets let's face okay so we we talked about this actually briefly but I went when I was

1018
01:45:23.60 --> 01:45:30.24
my way to Greg Jane's house and I had some McDonald's straight up and I went kind of hard to

1019
01:45:30.24 --> 01:45:35.60
I didn't need anything all the it was week it was very very week oh that's the time you got like

1020
01:45:35.60 --> 01:45:39.44
taunted by it was right on the side of the road right on the side literally like

1021
01:45:39.44 --> 01:45:43.92
I don't know where you're to get the great chance as if you went through the McDonald's drive

1022
01:45:43.92 --> 01:45:48.48
through it's it's what you convince yourself that is what it felt like yes oh you know there's

1023
01:45:48.48 --> 01:45:52.64
that Wendy's right by victory I'm an infinite yeah oh yeah that's another one that's another but

1024
01:45:52.64 --> 01:45:56.96
I felt for the trap of Wendy's one time I told you this I think I told you this where after training

1025
01:45:56.96 --> 01:46:02.48
I was like I was a wood for Wendy's for like 48 hours and I was like oh man look there's the

1026
01:46:02.48 --> 01:46:06.32
Wendy's on the way to training I'm like there's the Wendy's it's today's the day I can't be with

1027
01:46:06.32 --> 01:46:12.40
this feeling yeah anymore I go train like kind of hard after training I go boom right into the

1028
01:46:12.40 --> 01:46:17.76
Wendy's right out of the Wendy's drive through boom go eat it and I felt completely like shit after

1029
01:46:17.76 --> 01:46:23.36
oh yeah completely after training Wendy's boy it like it jams you up oh yeah you shouldn't do that

1030
01:46:23.36 --> 01:46:28.48
from then on Wendy's is easier to resist check this out imagine if you could go to Wendy's

1031
01:46:28.48 --> 01:46:32.72
and you ate and it was delicious and made you feel great yeah yeah help you recover that's what this

paramedics and mt's dispatchers correctional officers board patrol secret service and all first responders

1130
01:56:03.04 --> 01:56:08.72
thank you for standing duty here on the home front and keeping us all safe and everyone out

1131
01:56:08.72 --> 01:56:14.64
out there there's a common theme in this book that like i said it's really not in this book and that

1132
01:56:14.64 --> 01:56:24.80
is a failure to detach and as we read these blunders and errors and catastrophes it's so easy to

1133
01:56:24.80 --> 01:56:32.08
see these mistakes being made but they're not obvious to the people that are caught up in making

1134
01:56:32.08 --> 01:56:40.08
these mistakes they can't see the tactical errors they can't see their emotions they can't see their

1135
01:56:40.08 --> 01:56:50.80
ego and it wrecks them and it causes these disasters so don't allow that to happen to you

1136
01:56:51.76 --> 01:56:57.84
the worst mistakes we make are the ones we don't see and we don't see them because we're too close

1137
01:56:57.84 --> 01:57:06.88
so step back detach see what you're supposed to see and that will allow you to do what you are

1138
01:57:06.88 --> 01:57:14.40
supposed to do and until next time zade an echo and jockel out
